00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:22,570
Hi. Hello again, everybody. And TV here. Welcome back. We're gonna play Dusk. Picking up exactly

2
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:35,350
where we left off yesterday. This game is really good. Can we just please see Otto before you're

3
00:00:35,350 --> 00:01:13,450
naked? Uh, you can't really see. Hold on. He blends in with the, he blends in with a blanket.

4
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,819
Let me see if I can brighten this up so you can zoom in on him and brighten it up.

5
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:59,739
I'm not sure it's possible, guys. Actually, maybe it is. Okay, hold on. Hey, Otto. Hello, Otto. Hello.

6
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:14,169
What are you doing? Yes, it's me. Otto. He's like, what are you doing? Who's my good dog?

7
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:31,379
There you go. Otto spotted. This is just what he does, guys. He just likes to hang out on a big

8
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:41,430
pillow and go to sleep. And he also likes going outside too. He's like a lizard. He just like,

9
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:52,300
he basks in the sun. That's what he does. He finds a spot in the house that has a strip of sunlight

10
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,900
coming through. And then he just gets in it and just lies on his back and just absorbs every ray.

11
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:12,199
He's the best. He works real hard. Yeah. Are you sure he's not a cat? Pretty sure. Let Otto play.

12
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,439
Hey, guys, Otto doesn't know what a video game is. I hate to break it to you.

13
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:30,710
But we're gonna leave just right where we left off. Dusk. Now, here's the thing about games.

14
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:39,500
I'm sure a lot of you guys know. There's this period of playing a game that's like this,

15
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,219
where you're up and up and up and up and up and it'd been stress, like good stress. Muscle memory.

16
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:52,379
You're into it. You're ready to fucking blow away everybody. And then you go to bed and you wake up

17
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,340
the next day and you play, you're like a wet noodle. So I'm gonna have to get back into it.

18
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:07,430
Here we go. Oh, you can't even see it. Oh, thank God. I thought my fucking whole stream's gonna

19
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,599
turn off. So I gotta, I gotta like move my arms around. I gotta get ready. I'm probably gonna die

20
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,920
like 10 times in the first five minutes. Maybe I'm not gonna die at all. What are you talking about?

21
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,259
But I love this game. This game's been more fun than anything that I've played in a long time.

22
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:45,180
Stamp it. I enjoy this. All right, let's go. Oh, where were we? Save, load here. I just started

23
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,920
level two. Oh, Otto wants to leave. He's like, now I want to leave. All right, let me let him out.

24
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,279
Hold on. I do. I thought he was gonna just lie down, but he's like, get me out of here. I don't

25
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:27,319
want to be in his room. So let me go let him out. Hold on. I'll be right back. Okay. He had his fun

26
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:41,529
lying down. Did he show Otto already? I did. All right, here we go. Load it. Press any key. All

27
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:50,649
right, let's get back into this here. Timing on that is good. Four, five, six, seven. One, two,

28
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:56,279
three, four, five, six, seven. Timing. All right, let's go. Oh, by the way, I was told I've been

29
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:04,259
doing this wrong the whole time. I was like flicking around and doing the the jump that way.

30
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:11,800
That's not how it works in this game. You just have to like jump diagonally like that.

31
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,399
I was going like doing the source engine jump and that's not what you're supposed to do.

32
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:31,050
And I was doing it all stream. Well, this is new. All right, let's take super shotgun out. Wait,

33
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:45,019
no, rifle. Yep, yep, yep, yep. Right in the head. See you later. Where are you?

34
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:51,699
All right. All right, blue chip is up there. Blue door in front of us. This is that little people

35
00:06:51,699 --> 00:07:06,730
here. Yep. Yep. You're here for that fucking commentary. You're here for the yep commentary.

36
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:17,939
What's he at up top? Oh, yep. All right. I'm making I'm going to make some pretty good progress

37
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:34,680
today. I'll tell you. I thought I wasn't ready for this game. I used it. I didn't know they

38
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:42,819
could use it. They can. Where are they coming from? Where's where they come from? All right. I need

39
00:07:42,819 --> 00:08:01,660
health. I don't slow down. Give me the blue chip. Save the game. Oh, fuck. No. Okay. How are we

40
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:09,399
doing? Good. I'm going to get over there. Good. Good. Good. Collect all the collectibles.

41
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:26,199
Save it. Oh, pod. What do I want to do here? Anything over this way? No. Can I jump from

42
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:40,659
here to there? Let's find out. No. Damn it. Damn it. Say pod one more time. I fucking dare you.

43
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:53,080
Jesus. I want to collect ammo because I want to make sure I have enough

44
00:08:53,799 --> 00:09:03,220
as we continue here. I feel so good to play. It feels so good to play. Oh,

45
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:22,779
ain't fucking wrong with you. So I have the blue but all right this yellow over there.

46
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:35,580
I hear another yeller. Where's yeller? Secret door. Okay. I have to open this. All right.

47
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,480
There's a yeller in there. I don't know why I'm calling mama yeller. All right. Let's go open

48
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:55,190
the blue door. All right. Save it. I'm ready. What should I use? Let's go with mortars. Okay.

49
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:04,470
These are all going to open it. It's going to be a bunch of aliens because look at this.

50
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:19,049
There's a power up on top. Don't get fancy with it. So what am I supposed to do? Okay. Here we go.

51
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:25,370
Ready? That's probably the yellow key card I assume. How do I get up here? Can I jump up here?

52
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:55,429
Need to wall climb. Well here we go. Screaming doctor. Oh Jesus. Oh there's a bunch of screaming

53
00:10:55,429 --> 00:11:19,399
doctors. I'm dead. Holy fuck. I don't even know where I am. All right. Settle down. Oh man. He's

54
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:27,299
made out of noodles. I am. I'm not. Okay. If I get touched once I'm dead. This guy's freaking me out.

55
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,980
Look at his pattern. His pattern's all fucked up. His pattern's all fucked up. And there's a guy

56
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,220
up there. All right. Don't do this. Just run in and shoot him. Oh my god.

57
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:49,850
All right. It's going to happen once. It's going to happen once. Get my mortars out. I'm ready.

58
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:58,779
I forgot about these guys. I almost had it too and that's unfortunate. I'm going to mortars.

59
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,559
It definitely went up. Oh a crossbow. Probably mortars. It's just been once. I'm going to get

60
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:24,470
him to run outside and go. Got it. All right. Now I can settle down a little and take out the

61
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:41,179
the rifle. Let's get the big guys upstairs. That's it, right? Damn it. All right. Not

62
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:56,139
pretty good. Not bad. Could have been better. Well, now I know you're up there. I could have

63
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:00,539
jumped through the window and grabbed that. No, that's super. That's super. I don't even know

64
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:08,200
what that is. That's like ultra move, right? Well, I have ultra move. Let's just get some health and

65
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:16,059
okay. Should I? I'm going to get ultra move and then I got to get the, uh, maybe that key.

66
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,860
Let me go down here. I'm going to save the super duper move.

67
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:34,620
Bastard. There's another guy down here. There's like a bunch of people down here. Isn't there?

68
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:52,549
Yeah. Oh my fucking God. I didn't know he was right there. All right. Come on.

69
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:05,379
Holy shit. She can go through there too. I don't know. She could aim that way. Stop cussing.

70
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:15,190
All right. Fine. I won't say any, I won't say any bad words for the next five minutes

71
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:21,259
or I'll eat. If I say, if I say a swear word in the next five minutes, I'll eat a ghost pepper.

72
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:43,419
What? That's good. What was that? Oh, it's, it's a when to go. Uh huh. All right. Give me this thing.

73
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,610
Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where, where is he? Where is he? Where am I?

74
00:14:48,409 --> 00:15:01,000
Is there another one? I hear something. Okay. I can open that gate now. No, wait, wait, wait,

75
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:13,379
wait, wait, wait. I'm going to go save the game. Let me grab the, yeah. Turn this on. What's,

76
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:33,690
what's the matter? Ghost pepper swear challenge. Yeah. I'm good. Ghost pepper swear challenge.

77
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,409
All right. Let me keep going. Uh, what door opened? A door opened. It was this one.

78
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,070
All right. Here we go. I'm going to get the, give me the super power and I'm going to jump

79
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,950
through here. You ready? Let's see if I can do it in one swoop. Nope. I'm terrible. I almost set

80
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,070
a swear word. I would have to eat it. I would have had to eat a ghost pepper. Good thing I didn't.

81
00:15:53,509 --> 00:16:07,990
Oh, I don't even like that one. That one's not that good. Geez.

82
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't grab it yet. Even thinking about swearing. No, it doesn't. You guys even,

83
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,679
have you ever even seen somebody eat a ghost pepper? No, you haven't. What you've seen is

84
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:40,919
you've seen YouTubers take a tomato that's under ripe and they eat it and pretend it's hot and they

85
00:16:40,919 --> 00:17:08,410
go, Oh, they take sun dried tomatoes and then they pretend that they're hot. Here we go. Here we go.

86
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,609
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. I'm doing it just so you have like a bunch of

87
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:20,490
clips of me saying it, even though you already, okay, hold on. Oh, here we go. Goodness.

88
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:43,750
Okay. Here we go. Did I just throw it over his head?

89
00:17:43,750 --> 00:18:17,819
Gotta go to the yellow door. Good work. Oops. Hey, thanks. What, were you talking to me or were you

90
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:23,910
talking to chat? I hope you're talking to me. Get these onions. I hear somebody shooting. Who is it?

91
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:41,500
Wow. It's you out there, isn't it? I haven't gotten any secrets yet, which concerns me.

92
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:32,069
Okay. Here we go. Super hot. Super hot. Here we go.

93
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:55,059
How's he doing? Oh, there is one of those. I don't like the slow mode. It freaks me out.

94
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:12,170
All right. We're good. So now we're not good. Damn it. All right. It's okay. Okay. Here. I'm

95
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:18,069
not going to say it because I was going to say that the thing that I usually say, but I'm not

96
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:42,980
saying right now. All right. Here we go. Wait, save it. Give me these onions. I'm just so

97
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,500
concerned that it could be something around the corner. I'm ready. Yeah. I got a stuff saying,

98
00:20:48,500 --> 00:21:15,930
here we go. Oh, it's going to be assault rifle and it's going to be fast. Let's do it.

99
00:21:46,339 --> 00:22:03,400
Oh man. Wait, that's okay. I was panicking for no reason. I thought these were projectiles

100
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:15,990
coming to kill me. All right. I thought these were just bullets flying everywhere. That's why

101
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:33,460
I was freaking out. I don't want to touch that yet. I want to collect. There's a button to press

102
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:48,019
too. And this teleporter takes me somewhere. Hmm. A cage lowers. Oh, the other cage. Right.

103
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,630
All right. It's harder to not say here we go than it is to say the F word.

104
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:10,440
That was green. I thought it was a bad guy.

105
00:23:36,059 --> 00:24:06,569
We clear. Don't get run over. Thank you. No secrets though. Damn it. How did I not get any

106
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:17,029
secrets? That's bad because there's a good, a lot of ammo and shit. It's been five minutes.

107
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:30,779
I'm going to use pistols because I just need it. I need to start using them. Yellow door right here.

108
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:45,430
This is horrible. I already don't like this level for obvious reasons. I need hunting

109
00:24:45,430 --> 00:25:00,970
rifles. My favorite weapon. It's you down there, isn't it? Yep, it is. Make sure nothing else here.

110
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:13,960
Secret. I don't want to get zero out of five secrets. Is this Turok? This game is better

111
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:25,339
than Turok. Check over this way. Yep. This is what I'm saying. I gotta slow down. Okay.

112
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:52,140
Okay. Let's go. Save it. Is that a hunting rifle? Thank God. Psycho scientist. Jesus.

113
00:25:52,220 --> 00:26:10,019
I hate those guys. They run so fast. All right. Red door.

114
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:24,950
Hunting rifle. My favorite weapon because I'm pinpoint accurate with it. Got two in one. I'm

115
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:41,589
going to get up here. Secret. There's two. See, I already am doing better than I was last time.

116
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:50,579
Put the hunting rifle away. Let's do pistols. I've been neglecting them so hard.

117
00:26:51,460 --> 00:27:03,049
A lot of those guys around corners. What was that? I just heard a laugh. Oh, I thought that was a

118
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:27,819
wheezing laugh. What do I have ammo in? Only the pistols, seriously. What was that? I heard it.

119
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:42,819
Yep. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Point blank. Dead. Downstairs. Let's go.

120
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:54,740
Where is he? Didn't even take a hit. All right. I got yellow key. Nothing else, right?

121
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:15,910
Nothing else I need. No, let's go. The darkness spreads. The darkness is spreading. Blue door.

122
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,809
Saw a rifle. I'll use it. I'll use it. That sounds like a good idea right now.

123
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:38,809
What is that noise? I don't want to turn the corner. I don't want to turn the corner.

124
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:20,359
I need key. I almost just shot that. This is one of those adrenaline pumping games. I love it.

125
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,980
You open a door sometimes and it's just like you could just feel all your blood turn to a stone.

126
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:33,130
And nothing else in here. Go down, I guess. There was another way to go.

127
00:29:34,009 --> 00:30:00,950
Down? Something down there. Okay, there's diamond down there. Just wait. I'm gonna go. I'm going

128
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:22,220
down. I thought that I could have. No. Going in. There comes somebody running. Oh, shit. I just

129
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:47,609
got triple tapped. Got him. Whoa. Wait, is there another sentry? There's another sentry somewhere.

130
00:30:48,490 --> 00:31:01,220
If I move, I'm dead. Where is it? Where is it? Oh my goodness. Okay. All right. Shotgun time.

131
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:06,900
Let's replace that. I'm gonna use double shotgun. Yeah. I think that's time for it.

132
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:30,220
Why are they pushing each other? Who? It is blue. Let's get that blue key. What was it over here?

133
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:45,349
Right there. Can I get up to this one? Oh. Nice try. Almost. Almost killed me. It was close.

134
00:31:45,829 --> 00:32:00,900
There's a lot of stuff here though. I don't want to just run away. Wait a minute. Let me check. No,

135
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:07,420
let's just go. Somebody else will get the secrets. One of you guys will get the secrets.

136
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:46,150
Run. I can hear him running. He's got like, hooves. That's the way. Wait, what's over here?

137
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:58,900
Nothing. That's a lot of mortars. That's a lot. Uh, maybe a rib. I got, I got a lot of,

138
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:10,680
I don't want to use these yet though. This is a boss killer. Let's use mortars. Did I

139
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:20,259
tele-frag somebody? What happened? Where is he? I can hear him. I can hear his hooves.

140
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:32,710
I can hear his hooves. Where is he? I hear multiple hooves. Oh, where is he?

141
00:33:40,460 --> 00:34:14,599
Ow. My whole body. Okay. I'm fine. Oh, he's still alive. Oh, okay. Can I peek out now?

142
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:45,699
Good. That's why they gave all those to me. How kind of them. Go up. Oh, why is the gas in here

143
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:56,539
now? All right. Blue door, blue door. And then I got to let Otto back in the room.

144
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:12,710
He's like, I want to get out of here. And then he's like, let me back in. The blue door is down

145
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:22,070
here, I think. All right. Was it? No, it wasn't. Where was it? All right. Hold on. Let me go get

146
00:35:22,070 --> 00:36:06,840
him. Hold on a second. Okay. Now he's happy. I'm watching like 15 minutes. He's like, hey,

147
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:22,090
this room sucks. I want to go somewhere else. We'll see. You good? He's good. He's just a cat.

148
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:43,260
All right. Blue door. Secret. Oh, this is good for me. That's very good for me. There he goes.

149
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:53,449
Down. Just sitting down. Good boy. All right. Let's uh, that's a red door. What was the blue one?

150
00:36:54,010 --> 00:37:01,909
I remember I always look at them and I go, there's blue door. And then I forget where they were.

151
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:14,309
Where is it? Use your map. There ain't no map in this game. Wait, is it this way? Was it over here?

152
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:50,119
Did I go back too far? I think I went back too far. Press M. There's no map in this game, guys.

153
00:37:50,840 --> 00:38:01,510
It was next to the red text. What is that? I always just say, there it is. There's the blue door.

154
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:16,920
And then I, it's gone immediately. I forget where it is entirely because the game made me come back

155
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:23,980
up here. So it has to be up here. And that has to be back up this way, right? It has to be.

156
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:52,500
It was just around this little corner. Here we go. Red door is back down there. Remember that.

157
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:27,159
Clip it for me. Oh, you dare? Holy shit. I just got destroyed. I'm going to get up on these roofs.

158
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:43,769
I think I'm going to try to at least. Can I? I have to press. I have to touch this. Oh no. 5G.

159
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:56,420
This is the source of the 5G. We're going to follow this all the way down. It's going to be,

160
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:03,690
it's going to be an alien down here. Sparks take from men, bad, which has never been taken.

161
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:10,019
I always knew that 5G was fucking just Satan. The whole thing, the whole wireless technology

162
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:13,619
makes no sense. Like you could send that shit through wirelessly with no wires.

163
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:21,849
The whole thing's fucked up. I just quick saved it right here. That was probably a huge mistake.

164
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:51,579
All right. I need to use the daredevil technique. Can't open this door.

165
00:40:53,079 --> 00:41:10,010
All these doors don't open. There's a switch back here. What's it for though? What was that?

166
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:35,079
Oh, shadow. Oh, that's how you light up a place. That's a gasoline tank. Wait, the red

167
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:41,929
was in a secret. The key card for the red door back there is a secret. That's sort of

168
00:41:42,570 --> 00:42:22,329
hard. Oh, we got the lights back on. This is fine. I heard it. Oh my God. I just fell down.

169
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:37,219
Where am I going? The root. What does it say? What does it say? There's too much smoke. The ruins

170
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:58,179
held knowledge. We sold our souls for it. All cars built of concrete. Fed with blood.

171
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:30,409
I missed the flashlight. What? Where? Where's the flashlight? Are you serious? I'm going to run.

172
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:52,460
I can't see anything. Navigate with your bullet holes. There it is.

173
00:43:54,099 --> 00:44:04,070
Ha ha ha. Okay, just give me a sec. This is the way back. I don't even use the pistols anyways.

174
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:17,530
Wait, what's down there? Oh, that's where I need to go. Navigate with bullet holes. There we go.

175
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:29,480
The ruins held knowledge. We sold our souls for it. Couldn't read that one. All cars built of

176
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:52,550
concrete. Fed with blood and bone. This door opens elsewhere. Nice secret. I'll take it.

177
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,659
Get everything first. Something bad is going to happen when I press this button

178
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:35,579
and then grind it up. I think I just power the facility with meat. But wait,

179
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:50,469
I don't want to end the level yet. No, I thought it didn't say end level. It just said open door.

180
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:59,989
Usually it says end level. It said exit, but it doesn't say end level. It says end level.

181
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:09,659
I've been trolled a couple times with exits before. No, I'm going back. I'm going back.

182
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:38,440
It's this one, right? Did I get that shit? Yeah. All right. I'm not going this way. I'm going back.

183
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:53,460
Here we are. Red door. Now, fellas, ladies and fellas, where was that red door? I don't remember.

184
00:46:53,460 --> 00:47:16,630
Over here, right? Was it this way? Red door. Here we go. That's what I'm talking about. That's

185
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:25,239
quite, that's a secret. Now I have to get back to where I was. So the real question is,

186
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:50,139
um, huh? How do you want me to do that? Just have to run there. But there's power here now.

187
00:47:50,780 --> 00:48:10,619
Am I going to lose the health that I just got? Nope. Good. Now I can leave. Where the hell was

188
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:18,889
it again? I can open this. I can open these those too. Remember these wouldn't open before?

189
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:25,670
Wait a minute. There's like another door or two that were closed. This was, okay, this one was

190
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:50,940
closed. This one was closed too, right? Ah, don't read the tweet. Already did. Now I can leave.

191
00:48:50,940 --> 00:49:11,300
I just 100% level. I did. That's the first time I've done that. But you cheated. It's all right.

192
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:24,300
You can go back and re-cheat. Here it comes. No turning back now. All right, there's health back

193
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:49,289
here. These two of them. Bad. That was, that's why there's all the health back here. I see. Mortars.

194
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:22,340
Exterminated. Crossbow. Why is this here? I'm not going there yet. Let's go this way.

195
00:50:22,420 --> 00:51:11,369
Kill him. Whoa! You were standing there. Big whoa. Big whoa. Anything down here? Red door. Okay.

196
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:19,690
I want to take a mental picture of this place. Stairwell. Goes down with the, great with the

197
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:28,630
lava. Around the corner. Great with lava. Downstairs. Red door. I got it. Memorized. Downstairs.

198
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:40,179
Red door. Lava. Great. Got it. Okay. Yellow door. Yellow door is in the same room as red door.

199
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:45,219
They're in the same room upstairs instead of down. Up the stairs. They're in the same area. Got it.

200
00:51:45,780 --> 00:52:05,179
Okay. Green pyramid. Red door. No, don't say that. You're gonna mess it up. I know what it is. It's

201
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:31,750
red lava. Great. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. That spikes. If I slide under there, I'm dead.

202
00:52:34,309 --> 00:53:05,500
That's a mama. Whoa! Nice aim. Let's check the rest of this place out. What we got?

203
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:18,869
I have a lot of the riveter ammo. I should probably use it.

204
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:47,429
So now it's boss only. Bosses only. Red key. I know what that room is. That's a new enemy.

205
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:58,519
No it's not. I've seen that enemy a million times. Gotta make these count. I can't just miss.

206
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:50,070
I want to get up there. Blue key up there. Whatever. Just let me out. Red. This is a room

207
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:54,230
that's gonna be full with people. They're all down. They're all down. They're all down.

208
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:24,090
Give me... No! Stop it! I want this. Can that go through the grate? Yep. All right. Anything

209
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:34,889
else up here? Secrets. Money. Blue door. That's... This is where the blue door is. I would forget this.

210
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:44,869
Green sewer room. This blue door. He only cares about money.

211
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:20,710
Killing spree. Pretty good progress. What's the point of being down here though? Can I open this?

212
00:56:33,800 --> 00:57:00,820
Oh my... No! No! No! Fuck! Speaking gibberish. That's all... Just gibberish. Whatever. Boss only.

213
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:20,039
Am I bumping into the wall? Oh there was a wall here. They've turned us mad. Teleporter.

214
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:38,150
Let's move. Kill him. I'm up now. Here it comes. Yellow.

215
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:44,010
Yellow key. I know what that door is.

216
00:57:46,170 --> 00:58:03,639
I only have 30 health. That's not good. This is very bad actually.

217
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:48,340
Missed a secret wall? What? Where? That's not it? What is it? I got it. Put the motors away. Double

218
00:58:48,340 --> 00:59:15,460
shotgun. Did you actually... Did one of these little idiots just got me? I'm gonna turn this

219
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:32,809
corner and I'm gonna hear that. No. I'm almost dead though. All right. That was... I need health.

220
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:43,670
I need health. I need health. I need health. Damn. I thought there was like... I thought there was gonna

221
00:59:43,670 --> 01:00:04,219
be something over here. Give me a saw rifle for this part.

222
01:00:09,429 --> 01:00:20,699
I can slide under these. Can I not slide under these? I guess not. Nothing under them anyways.

223
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:42,599
Damn. Took a while. All right. I'm going... That's a terrible place to fight this. I gotta jump around.

224
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:55,110
All right. Double battle shotgun. I'm gonna jump over him. Kill him. So let's drag him back here.

225
01:00:55,909 --> 01:01:11,659
That's a tight place to fight this thing. Maybe if I run by him. I'll try running by him.

226
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:44,309
No. Just gotta be right in his face the whole time. All right. There's the key. Is that the key?

227
01:01:45,829 --> 01:02:14,760
No. Well, shit. Can I break this? 15 health. Hmm. Well. Am I missing something here?

228
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:30,949
There was no switch I could have licked around. Is this a collapsible door? Wait. What about

229
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:36,039
switches over here? There we are. All right. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. We're good.

230
01:02:46,860 --> 01:03:07,780
Any repeaters? What do you mean repeaters? Any repeaters? What? I don't like that sound.

231
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:49,099
This is why I saved it. This is why I saved it. I swear to God, Jeremy. That's why I saved this.

232
01:03:49,659 --> 01:04:03,460
We're gonna. Okay. I'm gonna keep it out because I keep hearing this shit and I'm gonna press the

233
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:19,610
button and I'm gonna get attacked again. What the fuck is this? Why did I use the. I saved it there

234
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:29,400
too. Why did I use it on the alligator? Oh no. I used it all on the alligator. That wasn't even

235
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,800
the real boss fight. That was the pretend boss fight for the real boss fight, which is this.

236
01:04:34,760 --> 01:05:04,619
Did you just bounce that back? All right. That actually wasn't that bad.

237
01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:18,420
Uh, is there. Do I have to do that? It's something else happening now. Is that the boss fight before

238
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:31,690
the boss fight before the real boss fight? I don't know, but make sure I have everything.

239
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:47,300
Okay. I guess we're just going. What about the blue door? What about the blue key? Oh,

240
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:58,170
it was the real boss fight with the rats. Yeah, it kind of was. What about this? What about

241
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:09,110
that? How do I do that? Oh no. I didn't get it. It's okay. It's all right. One of the walls was

242
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:26,039
faked. Ah, shit. Pretty bad secret finding on that run, but it's all right. This one's called the

243
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:35,130
gauntlet. Hooray. I feel like this is going to be fun. This is going to be a very fun part of the

244
01:06:35,130 --> 01:07:05,380
game. I want to get these onions. Bring it on. I can't jump up there. I absolutely can. What is

245
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:12,039
all this? Wait, where did I just go? I don't even know where I just went. I went through like a

246
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:20,789
teleporter. I thought, I thought it was going to be this. I thought, okay, I don't know what in my

247
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:27,030
stupid ass brain. I thought that teleporter was going to go to here. I thought it was going to be

248
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:33,449
a shitty engineer teleporter that they just build out of, out of just muscle memory. You know, you,

249
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:37,050
this is, you exit the spawn door. Here's the teleporter and then you go and there's the exit

250
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,929
just because they put it down because they were just OCD putting stuff down.

251
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:45,739
I don't know why I thought that that was just try. Okay. I'm ready. I still want to get this

252
01:07:45,739 --> 01:08:05,639
stuff though. Is there like a fake wall? Cause I can't reach this. Do a rocket jump. That's

253
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:10,119
going to hurt me too much. No, I'm fine. I got 150 health. Let's go. Let's fight them.

254
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:19,750
So here we go. Let's do mortar first. Fuck. I'm in trouble. Slide jump. Does that work?

255
01:08:27,289 --> 01:08:31,369
Rocket jump. Yeah, I'm going to hurt myself to rocket jump up here to get the same amount of

256
01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:45,609
health that I'm probably going to lose by rocket jumping. Do a crossbow jump. You can,

257
01:08:45,609 --> 01:09:01,590
you can crossbow jump. What? I hold on. Am I about to kill the boss with this magic soap?

258
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:26,340
Wait, where'd the soap go? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

259
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,659
Is the soap in there? What'd I do with this?

260
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:58,420
That's not, I feel like that's kind of, uh, let me, um, I don't, that's not fair though.

261
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:08,939
That's not fair. Like I just beat that, that I beat him. I magic soaked him. I mean, look,

262
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:16,439
you told me how to jump up there, but I saw the door. I mean, it's, it's intentional.

263
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:34,100
All right. Well, that's fun. Let's go three more to go. I can just walk around and just look at

264
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:55,659
this. Oh, I'm in danger. There's too many things here. It's the last one. Am I a cheater? No,

265
01:10:55,659 --> 01:11:09,350
I didn't put input any commands. How do I open this? Maybe I should just leave. There's only

266
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:57,739
two here. Just take the other teleporter. Where's the last switch? I don't understand. Go to the

267
01:11:57,739 --> 01:12:04,100
other one. I already did. Wait a minute. Hold on. I was, I must've been turned around like three

268
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:14,649
times then. Cause I, I've tried to go to the other teleporter. Wait, is this the, is it the,

269
01:12:14,649 --> 01:12:22,420
no magic. Where's my magic soap? I hear rock music. Where's my magic soap? I put it in here,

270
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:48,840
didn't I? Uh-oh. Uh-oh. One more to go. Don't get that yet. Sequence complete. Where is he?

271
01:12:48,840 --> 01:13:15,369
Where's the boss? Is he, is he dead? Oh, he's just dead. What's the, I got an achievement called low

272
01:13:15,369 --> 01:13:42,329
tech. It's cause I didn't fire a gun. It's cause I soaked him. I just beat it. I beat that episode.

273
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:48,340
That was the final boss of the episode and I instantly killed him. As you step into the

274
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:53,939
unholy portal powered by ungodly means there's no doubt what you must do. Hubris and fanaticism have

275
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:58,739
woken something powerful, horrible beyond anything you can imagine. You must uncover the truth. Who

276
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:22,010
knows what nightmare awaits you in the nameless city. Cool. Episode three. Let's do it. In the

277
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:36,840
nameless city. Out next week? No, out right now. This difficulty is not intended for a first

278
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:43,479
playthrough. Although you are German 985 and this is your first playthrough, but you have enough

279
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:55,140
skill to be able to press this button. That's what it said. Mint? Low doubt. What is going on?

280
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:02,100
Why can I, why am I, I can cheat? Why can I cheat? Is this cheating? What's going on?

281
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:27,880
So I, is this, is this supposed to be like, you go like the God level? No campaign to, oh.

282
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:36,810
Oops. New episode. All right. I see. Okay.

283
01:15:41,189 --> 01:16:14,119
Episode three. The nameless city. The iron cathedral. Welcome to hell. Sickles.

284
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:19,960
You don't get to keep anything. Let's move. Get my flashlight though. And I get the sword. Is

285
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:26,439
this going to, wait, is this a sword only level or something? The sword is a silent takedown at

286
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:40,069
a hundred or more health. Hold attack to charge strike. What? What? Charge strike? Silent takedown.

287
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:48,920
Why does that matter? Gotta hide a gas can back here on me. I'll be sure to use it the second

288
01:16:48,920 --> 01:17:13,960
the door opens. And two onions. Let's go. Do I have to sneak? All of a sudden it's a stealth game.

289
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:34,199
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean stupid? What's going on? What? Gas can on the wall.

290
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:55,000
What wall? What? What are you talking about? At the spawn. I love how I'm stupid for this.

291
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:33,109
It's stupid. How idiotic of him to not go back to the wall at spawn. It's kind of fun

292
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:54,409
playing a game. We get out of here. You didn't even do that. What the fuck was that thing? It's

293
01:18:54,409 --> 01:19:01,020
a night. It's a, it's a, it's a night. Oh my God. Do I have to fight it with the sword?

294
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:29,960
Do you, is there a parry? It's a parry. That's a parry. I can't charge it. I have to be at a hundred

295
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:40,760
health. Wait, this is the, hold on. I'm not going this far yet. There was a weapon over here that

296
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:46,439
I could get. No, not yet. How do I get over there? I probably have to go down at some point. All

297
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:52,939
right. That is the right one. Is the only way to go. Kill about dipshit stupid dipshit idiot.

298
01:19:52,939 --> 01:20:05,989
Fucking idiot. Stupid. What a dipshit idiot. Fucking idiot. At 50 or more morale, hold aim

299
01:20:05,989 --> 01:20:16,279
with the sword to block attacks. Yeah. And you got a soap right here. You know, I'm pretty good at

300
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:28,659
finding the soap. I will say I'm really good at finding the secret soaps and using them is another

301
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:39,060
thing. Where'd it go? I'm good at finding the soap. I'm not going to be using the soap.

302
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:15,510
Wow. All right. I'm not going to be using soap. All right. Now let's go.

303
01:21:16,869 --> 01:21:38,409
I don't have a hundred health though. Stupid. Where's the soap? That's why your name is Jerma.

304
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:51,689
I mean, that's pretty funny. It is. Wait for the guy with the night. I need the night.

305
01:21:52,569 --> 01:22:26,619
This fun. This is fun. Wow. I love it. And I soaked. No, don't. Why am I even doing that?

306
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:57,340
Hey, what? Where did you come from? 112 health. Where's the soap? I'm just gonna bring it with me

307
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:03,850
everywhere. It's always good to get rid of one of the hard enemies with it. Although is this

308
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:17,000
unlimited use? Can I use this as many times as I want? I'm trying to attack. Not going to work

309
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:40,920
like that, man. Sorry. He got annoyed at this. Check. I still don't understand what the smelly

310
01:23:40,920 --> 01:24:35,449
crystal does. What does the smelly crystal do? That didn't block it. All right. I got the blue

311
01:24:35,449 --> 01:24:56,220
key, but there's a lot of ways to, there's a bunch of random vents in this level. I guess over this

312
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:03,130
way, but there was another way to go. I think I could down. There's a crystal over there,

313
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:13,300
but wait a minute. I can open this door. I think that's progression. Hold on. My power went out.

314
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:18,500
What happened? Mine did too. What? I just turned the stream back on. What? Do you live in Vegas?

315
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:46,409
We're all mad here. No, this is okay. So I do have a blue key though. Wasn't there a blue door all the

316
01:25:46,409 --> 01:26:12,199
way back? I already have to pee. What a disaster. Because that could go down. Oh, I gotta pee. This

317
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:22,199
is messing with my brain to be able to play the video game correctly. Yeah, I gotta go.

318
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:28,500
I'll be right back. It's messing with my ability to play the video game. This is what happens when

319
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:37,640
you just drink large coffees every morning. Be right back. Don't go anywhere. Or if you have to

320
01:26:37,640 --> 01:28:47,930
go, fine. But if not, then stay. All right, we're good. I just dropped my lip balm on the ground.

321
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:50,649
It's capped and everything, but it just hit the ground. I have to get another one.

322
01:28:51,609 --> 01:29:04,810
There's germs on the ground. How big is the large coffee? How many ounces? You don't even want to

323
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:10,760
know. If I told you guys the amount of ounces that I had in my coffee, you'd think I was a

324
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:25,510
fucking sicko. I only do this like once every few weeks. But every time I do it, I always feel

325
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:37,939
bad about it. That's a secret door if I've ever seen one. Nice. Good thing I went back here.

326
01:29:38,579 --> 01:29:51,659
Now I got a mortar. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yeah, it's 32 ounces. Yep. I know. And even worse,

327
01:29:52,630 --> 01:30:01,210
way worse than it being 32 ounces. Light ice. You're a fucking psycho. Hey, can I get that with

328
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:08,460
light ice, please? Oh, okay. So you're, you're, you're a mutant. Okay. Got that. Now I need the

329
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:16,489
blue door. Where was the blue door? There was a red door here. Anyone remember the blue door?

330
01:30:16,489 --> 01:30:23,689
Anybody remember a blue door? I didn't burn it into my memory because I don't think it exists.

331
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:35,670
Blue door? Was there something else I could do back here? Blue door. I remember. And I got the

332
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:42,539
soap here too. You know, I didn't burn it into my brain because of that. This one, a blue door is

333
01:30:42,539 --> 01:30:52,899
blue things next to the door. Nice block. I can't get more than one. Okay. I, for some reason,

334
01:30:52,899 --> 01:31:17,260
I thought I could get two with a swipe. Is that open? That's okay. And then there's a beep too.

335
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:23,689
There was somebody that guy fucking, that was a multiple jump scare in front of me, guy running

336
01:31:23,689 --> 01:31:31,539
at me and to my left, a fucking horn at the same exact time. I don't know if you guys heard the

337
01:31:31,539 --> 01:31:49,930
horn. It was a huge beep. Somebody probably heard it. Someone with good ears. The soap is so good.

338
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:11,930
Oh my God. I just got embarrassed. That was embarrassed. Just straight up. I mean, just

339
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:18,710
embarrassed. So, so let me get this straight. You got, it's gotta actually physically hit the weapon,

340
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:32,979
right? It's not just, hey, your, your screen is now safe. I blame the double jump scare.

341
01:32:38,729 --> 01:32:42,010
All right, we're good. Now let's go back here and get the diamond. I don't even need it.

342
01:32:42,569 --> 01:32:50,340
Let's throw some mortars down the halls, huh? Soap is taking too much time. I'm going soapless.

343
01:32:53,619 --> 01:33:13,909
Okay. So it's just, it's a, it's a mystery good to go around here.

344
01:33:14,869 --> 01:33:31,590
You got to find the right way. It's a maze. It's a mystery. There it is. I don't think that's it.

345
01:33:36,199 --> 01:33:56,409
Remember the crossbow? I just jumped over that sword. Just want to make sure we're all aware

346
01:33:56,409 --> 01:34:14,380
of that one. All right, that's it. I got the, the new crossbow bullets. I didn't get anything else.

347
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:31,909
There are wells to go. I guess the lava arrow pointing down. Sure. Does the book do anything?

348
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:45,659
I feel like the book doesn't do just whatever. Throw me. Could have got those all with one hit.

349
01:34:46,460 --> 01:35:02,420
Not efficient. Look at this inefficiency. It's angering me. There we go. And I, you know,

350
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:14,710
I missed the crossbow goes through walls. That's right. It does. I forget.

351
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:50,819
Yep. That's pretty useful. Efficiency. Better. Not efficient. I feel like I could probably be

352
01:35:50,819 --> 01:36:19,909
efficient in this room though. What the fuck is this? Why is there a dog in a box? Bad dog.

353
01:36:23,829 --> 01:36:40,659
Bad dog. No, not you. Not you. I know you're in the same room, but not you. I don't want

354
01:36:40,659 --> 01:36:54,939
them to hear that. You're a good dog. You're a good dog. Yes. All enemies dead. Fire and ice.

355
01:36:55,739 --> 01:37:03,220
This is a new item. Lava cannot harm you. Oh, that's in limited time.

356
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:49,050
Do I have two swords? Oh, that's too bad. All right. Now what? Where is he? There. I need

357
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:58,119
another one of those, the lava head. Unless maybe can I go up? I'm going to try going this way.

358
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:11,529
I guess I can go this way. Did I miss anything over here? Oh, you son of a bitch. I, how did I,

359
01:38:11,529 --> 01:38:17,699
why you? Yeah. 28 health. Just, I got to shoot this thing. There's a secret wall here. Hopefully

360
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:38,970
there's health here. Dick. All right. There is health in here. Good. Lots of, uh, really?

361
01:38:40,859 --> 01:39:03,500
Really? Now what's that going to do for me? Hold on. Can I get up there? Holy shit.

362
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:25,579
Well, um, that's cool. I made, I skipped this blue door. Just don't fall. There's something

363
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:50,250
over there. I have to make this jump. I have to get this load. Why did, did I, hold on,

364
01:39:50,250 --> 01:40:03,640
did I just save it right there? No, I didn't. Okay. So now save it here so I can get back across,

365
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:18,859
get back across. We're just gonna, we're going to save scum again. Not that it's not that bad.

366
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:22,949
All right. Now I'm going to open this door. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing right now,

367
01:40:22,949 --> 01:40:33,319
but apparently I'm doing this. Oh, fuck. Why did I just do that? Don't, why would I jump away?

368
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:41,239
That's like, I just did like a fight or flight. It was flight. Flight. As much as you could

369
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:59,180
describe what that word is. Flight. What? Oh, I can't, I can't right click. I can't,

370
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:13,050
I don't have any morale. Fuck. Zero morale. Right. Okay. I need to have at least 50, right?

371
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:23,659
Damn. That's not good. I feel like I'm going to need that, uh, gas can.

372
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:34,779
And there's a soap down here. What the hell did I do? What, how, what direction is that even going?

373
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:55,529
I, I need the blue key. Am I, I'm behind the door that the blue key opens. Right? I think so.

374
01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:08,180
I think I just have to go back. Yeah, I just have to go back down. Um, whatever. Okay. I guess I

375
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:17,289
know that's there. No, I'm not soft-locked. I'm good. Has to actually go this way, which is the

376
01:42:17,289 --> 01:42:45,130
correct way. Okay. I thought that wasn't, that was not an enemy. I thought it was. God doing like

377
01:42:45,130 --> 01:43:05,750
the extreme NPC walk. Pistol. There's nothing even here to shoot. I got the super power up, but it

378
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:13,270
didn't. Okay. There's red and blue door over there. I need a key, man. No one opens elsewhere. All

379
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:42,390
right. Um, I guess I'm just going down. I ain't going down there yet. Now I am. Finally some

380
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:58,949
morale. It's been forever. And a shotgun. Finally. Shotgun shells. Ooh, I could go, let me jump.

381
01:43:58,949 --> 01:44:05,640
Hold on. Don't go there yet. What's over here? Nothing. I've already been over here.

382
01:44:11,449 --> 01:44:26,149
Lots of shotgun shells. It's armor. What do you mean it's armor? What's armor? Secret? What do I

383
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:31,800
do with this? Uh, don't go in the, is that going to light up? Is that going to, it doesn't explode,

384
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:37,420
right? No. Should I bring it with me? He's going to bring it with me. No, I'm just going to throw

385
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:49,340
it in there. Just whip it in there. I don't know if that did anything. Here comes a fight.

386
01:44:53,189 --> 01:45:10,489
Yeah. Yup. Yup. I can climb any wall. Hold on. I need to make, I'm not going to do this yet. I

387
01:45:10,489 --> 01:45:28,979
want to get stuff. Oh, fuck. Whatever. Just finally. Okay. Um, just make sure I don't miss

388
01:45:28,979 --> 01:45:40,659
anything. Smelly crystal. I don't know what these do. Okay. I should probably, I probably need to

389
01:45:40,659 --> 01:45:54,090
get up there. Is that soap? Hello? What did I just, what the hell just happened?

390
01:45:55,369 --> 01:46:34,310
That's a backflip. Nothing else I can do. This is gold. Good. Good. Do a flip. I told you I could

391
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:42,100
do a backflip. Have I ever proven that? No, no, I actually can't do it anymore. Absolutely cannot

392
01:46:42,100 --> 01:47:00,140
do it anymore. Too old to do it? Yeah. I, yes, I'm too old to do that. Without a doubt. I'm certain

393
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:10,659
that I'm too old. All right. Now I can use my sword if I need it. We're going to go back down.

394
01:47:10,659 --> 01:47:37,029
We're going to. I'm not fucking around with that. No loot? How dare you? I could go up a little

395
01:47:37,029 --> 01:48:04,199
higher I think. Yeah, I can. Ah. The crossbow is a lot of fun. Oh, drunk fighting. I was too,

396
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:10,970
I was too drunk to hit me. I don't know how that works. That makes no sense what I just said.

397
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:38,300
Blue key. What door over there? Oh, that's the door. That's the, that's the blue door.

398
01:48:38,859 --> 01:49:09,539
Okay. Right. Now I can just go this way. Got him. That guy fell to his death. I didn't have to do

399
01:49:09,539 --> 01:49:23,779
anything. Come on. Kill me. I'm here. Kill me. Boss fight incoming. Uh huh. Three more of these to

400
01:49:23,779 --> 01:49:28,500
touch. I'm going to get. All right. Let's see. What about, what about mortars? Or sword maybe.

401
01:49:34,680 --> 01:50:00,380
Rifle. Best weapon. The waves of destruction. To know. Any more writing? Two more to go. One

402
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:09,020
more to go. This is a rifle. This is going to be a sniping level. That's much as certain.

403
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:48,439
I think it's probably inside. The damning cooling gun. Cooling sun. Where is it?

404
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:52,760
Did I miss one? I must've missed one.

405
01:50:56,779 --> 01:51:09,270
Here it is. Oh, they're flying.

406
01:51:20,310 --> 01:52:01,859
Shit. It's hard to see my crosshair because it's snowy. It's very snowy. Yeah.

407
01:52:01,859 --> 01:52:15,479
Jerma gave his older brother the controller. Yeah. Junko. Jerma's older brother. Junko.

408
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:25,699
Junko. All right. Got red key. I can go back down. Uh wait. Did I miss anything?

409
01:52:27,899 --> 01:52:43,640
It's just fun to shoot in this game. It's very fun. Just is. All right. Let's go. There's a red

410
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:54,409
door down here. Somewhere. I don't know. Whatever. Wherever it is. It's back this way. I think it's

411
01:52:54,409 --> 01:53:05,500
back here. Right? No. Where is it? No. Where was it? No. It was back here. Don't worry. Just

412
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:13,000
leap. Oh my. Oh my fucking god. That scared the shit out of me. I was about to say have no

413
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:30,840
fear. Junko will save the day. That's a one hit kill. Good to know. Where the? Holy shit. It's

414
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:48,180
an ant. It's one of those monsters. Just stand still. It's gonna hit. Should I do it? Yeah.

415
01:53:48,899 --> 01:54:09,619
True hard run would have no saves. Sure. I guess. But the true hard mode is also take one hit of

416
01:54:09,619 --> 01:54:16,899
damage and you die. Actually that's not even actually what that mode is for. This is the

417
01:54:16,899 --> 01:54:23,979
hardest game mode in the game that I'm on right now. The one above it is a challenge mode. It's a

418
01:54:23,979 --> 01:54:34,310
challenge mode. Specifically challenge mode. So it is true. This is the hardest difficulty of the

419
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:51,000
regular game. There's a lot of people dead over here. Well this is gonna be fun. Actually it's

420
01:54:51,000 --> 01:55:03,220
gonna be fun. I like the ones where you can just like ski around. All these. Can I open these?

421
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:14,170
This door opens elsewhere. This door. Well I know you exist now. That's good. Who's talking?

422
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:33,289
What are they? I'm not gonna use those bullets. Might as well use them for that. Hold on. Give

423
01:55:33,289 --> 01:55:46,069
me this stuff. Go down the well. There's all kinds of little things to look at. This one opens.

424
01:55:48,859 --> 01:56:10,310
Where is he? Up top. Yep. What the? Flying fuck.

425
01:56:11,109 --> 01:56:47,460
Fuck. Quit edge guarding me. Was this Smash Brothers? Not fair. You can open these doors

426
01:56:47,460 --> 01:57:01,529
from the other side. All right. Let's go. God damn it. The sound. It hurts. It hurts. It really does

427
01:57:01,529 --> 01:57:17,340
hurt. Oh. Let me just get these all open. Give me that. Oh my under. My armpits are itchy right

428
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:21,420
now after that. I don't know. Is there any doctors in here that can tell me why that is?

429
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:35,500
Why do I have itchy armpits after being scared? Wait. It looks like I can jump off the ladder.

430
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:59,989
You doofus. I don't want to be up there because I can see. There's the red door.

431
01:58:02,659 --> 01:58:06,260
I can get that gun. There's an extra sword. What is it? But if you already have a sword,

432
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:24,550
what's the point? Rifle. Let's just use it. I think we're clear. I thought that was yellow.

433
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:32,420
There's a red door and then a red door and then red door. There we go. There was no reason for that

434
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:35,859
to happen. There was no reason for what just happened to happen. You know what I'm saying?

435
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:48,859
There was no reason for that. I don't have any morale. I'm dead. What the fuck? Let's just grab

436
01:58:48,859 --> 01:58:55,510
the key and instantly scream in front of me. Guy. Oh. All right. Well, I've got to be aware of that.

437
01:58:56,630 --> 01:59:22,819
Shit. Give me this health. All right. Here's my ammo that I wanted and I fell.

438
01:59:23,859 --> 01:59:37,130
Kill that guy. Wait. What's in there? There's shit in there. Don't get that key. Get in there.

439
01:59:37,130 --> 02:00:02,579
What's in here? Not bad. Shotgun. I need a big shotgun. I've got plenty of ammo. I think it's

440
02:00:02,579 --> 02:00:11,909
time to start this. What do I have for my hunting rifle? Not 15. I want 15. I refuse to play unless

441
02:00:11,909 --> 02:00:26,729
I have 15 hunting rifle ammo. It's the only way I feel comfortable is up there. Plus, I will not

442
02:00:26,729 --> 02:00:31,529
do all this. I need to do ammo collection now because I won't do it later. You all know it.

443
02:00:32,250 --> 02:01:05,020
That looks suspicious. All right. Wait. All right. Let's go. Wait. There's so many little

444
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:12,460
like nooks and crannies here. What does this do? A house opens. Which house? Another house? A house

445
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:44,659
opened? No. Too many things. Which house opened? Is this house? I can go in here.

446
02:01:47,699 --> 02:01:57,779
What is this for? There's a lot of places to go here. I think this is the house, right?

447
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:09,609
Was that the house that opened? I don't know. Maybe another day I'll figure it out. Let's go.

448
02:02:12,489 --> 02:02:45,529
Right off the bat. Too many of you. Jesus. How am I not hitting you? Oh, fuck. I forgot to

449
02:02:45,529 --> 02:03:02,649
quick save it right before. Did I? No, I did. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. That was bad.

450
02:03:02,649 --> 02:04:14,119
I forgot about the guys in the air. Let's go. Clean it up. That's how you get it done. Is it

451
02:04:14,119 --> 02:04:31,210
Junko or Jungo? Tell us before a civil war starts. No, it's Junko. Like junk. It's not Jungo.

452
02:04:31,770 --> 02:04:50,500
It's Junko. All that brother Junko. Imagine your name was Junko. Junk. J-U-N-K. Junko.

453
02:04:58,149 --> 02:05:14,579
Like junky. No, not junky. That's not. Junko is. That's fine. Give me this. Didn't even use the

454
02:05:14,579 --> 02:05:36,010
powerups either. All right. It's time. I got a red key. You gonna play this one on me? Huh? That's

455
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:51,340
why I saved it. Red door is up here somewhere. Where is it? Up that way? I know there's a weird

456
02:05:51,340 --> 02:06:02,600
red door somewhere like hanging out over here. Sure thing. I'll take a secret. Found the double

457
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:13,670
shotgun. I'm so happy I went up here. I'd be naked without this. All right. What is that red? There

458
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:23,590
it is. Oh, really? Look at that guy over there. I'm just gonna hide behind here. Of course,

459
02:06:23,590 --> 02:06:39,590
you're not gonna show your face. You're dealing with Junko. I would pity you. I wanted to kill

460
02:06:39,590 --> 02:06:54,119
you without picking that up. I just killed somebody. What? There he is. I fucking can smell him.

461
02:07:05,659 --> 02:07:18,979
Big guy. Don't go in the well. I'm gonna do it just because you told me not to.

462
02:07:21,159 --> 02:08:03,960
Well, we're in some shit, aren't we? Erratic. Erratic. Got him. This is the door that opened.

463
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:15,909
I can climb any surface. Which thing do I climb? The tallest thing here. Where am I? No, go, go,

464
02:08:15,909 --> 02:08:51,829
go, go. It was the tallest thing here. None of this matters. Do you drown in this game?

465
02:08:51,829 --> 02:09:14,779
What's all this down here? Can I? I'm gonna drown. All right. How do I get out of here?

466
02:09:14,779 --> 02:09:26,710
Monka. Oh, that's it. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Out, out, out, out. He can't fit through here,

467
02:09:26,710 --> 02:10:02,420
right? Can he fit through this? I gotta get further away.

468
02:10:03,619 --> 02:10:23,350
I wasn't gonna cheese that one. I've cheesed the last boss of the other encounter. I can't. Just

469
02:10:24,149 --> 02:10:41,100
come on. There's a yellow key. The shadow sunk our city. His monsters stripped our bones.

470
02:10:41,979 --> 02:11:18,279
The water rises. The bones are their dollars. Wait. I can swim around. All right. This sucks,

471
02:11:18,359 --> 02:11:43,670
but this is actually kind of cool. Swimming around. Let me get that health. Bomb the wall.

472
02:11:43,670 --> 02:11:58,600
Bomb the wall. Bomb the wall. What wall? Which wall do you want me to bomb? Bomb the wall. The

473
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:04,100
wall. In the wall. The wall. All right. Well, bye. You had your one chance to tell me where it was

474
02:12:04,819 --> 02:12:09,930
and you had to be funny about it. You had to be cute about it.

475
02:12:11,029 --> 02:12:43,430
What are those? I don't know what fish is now. And they're fast. What a dodge. Did you see that

476
02:12:43,430 --> 02:12:58,569
dodge on his part? One fish, two fish, red fish, dead fish. I don't think that's how the Dr. Seuss

477
02:12:58,569 --> 02:13:24,279
book goes. I can hold my breath for a very long time. Fish moly. Why you kill me? Is anybody else

478
02:13:24,279 --> 02:13:30,520
convinced that fish moly is like 29 by 29 instead of 28 by 28? It's bigger. The emote is bigger.

479
02:13:31,479 --> 02:14:02,439
Did it win? Are you winning? Crypt of the. More of this. No, I don't like not having.

480
02:14:02,439 --> 02:14:07,800
Ah, okay. Sword time. No, super shocking. I hear a new enemy type. I hear breathing.

481
02:14:08,439 --> 02:14:38,340
I already got the yellow key. All right, we win. I need my flashlights.

482
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:15,319
Oh, I just got. The door opened somewhere else. Oh, the yellow door is right behind me.

483
02:15:15,319 --> 02:15:47,560
Okay, this is dead end. The basement door opened. Okay, red keys up here. Ah,

484
02:15:50,039 --> 02:16:19,659
what's this? I blow it up. That's unfortunate. I hate this sound. I hate the sounds. I hate the

485
02:16:19,659 --> 02:16:23,979
sound. I knew it! There's a new monster. I told you it was a new monster. It's a big scary, like,

486
02:16:23,979 --> 02:16:55,190
big mouth frog guy. It's so stressful. What is. Okay. I hate this shit. Shotgun shells.

487
02:16:55,909 --> 02:17:28,100
Thanks. I guess. It looks like we're going in here. I knew it! The chaos enthralls us.

488
02:17:28,659 --> 02:17:48,250
The chaos crawls to me. Jesus Christ. Look at how much damage these things do. You guys are the

489
02:17:48,329 --> 02:18:00,010
worst. What does that do? Uh, just to kind of avoid to get back.

490
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:41,370
I was trying to pre-fire him. I have 30. I have 20 health. Wrong way. I'm dead.

491
02:18:53,399 --> 02:19:07,030
That was tricky. Who has a flashlight? There's a. I already have a sword. Why

492
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:09,350
does it want me to use the sword? I don't have enough morale to use the sword.

493
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:17,399
The closer they got, the more they suffered. I don't have enough morale for this. I need

494
02:19:17,399 --> 02:19:44,180
to just use a. Who's in this one? Anybody? Can I just close myself in here? That's your secret.

495
02:19:44,180 --> 02:20:06,899
Your secret is shotgun shells. That's not a very good secret. Don't tell anybody about my secret.

496
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:19,299
I'm getting closer to him. He's going to run down the hall. He's going to run down this hall.

497
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:23,379
Might as well make it. There's not even a hallway.

498
02:20:34,229 --> 02:20:41,270
Wait. Wait. What? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. It's not a frog.

499
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:55,180
It's one of the invisible ones. Time out. There's a. They're, they're down here though.

500
02:21:03,639 --> 02:21:08,280
It's definitely, uh, it's, I can't use that shit. It's going to kill me. I'm going to end up blowing

501
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:40,709
myself up. Is there a chest right here? No. I don't have a key. No. There's something else

502
02:21:40,709 --> 02:22:03,270
to do here. I need to get the blue key up. I guess I can go up, up there. No. Did I go this way?

503
02:22:04,069 --> 02:22:18,950
I've been this way. Did I miss something else? I mean, very clearly I can still hear that guy

504
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:41,989
breathing. Did I not go in one of these doors? What the fuck? Where, where is he? God.

505
02:22:43,159 --> 02:22:50,600
Oh, this is not supposed to be a scary game. This is not supposed to be a scary game.

506
02:22:50,600 --> 02:23:09,559
It's the flashlight. There's the key and I'm going to get swarmed. The second I turn around,

507
02:23:10,280 --> 02:23:38,870
I'm going to spam mortars up the, up the, up the door. Safe for now.

508
02:23:46,809 --> 02:23:52,250
I really don't like this level. It's too scary. It's too much. Can I blow that up?

509
02:23:53,049 --> 02:24:13,219
The ladder there. Well, I'm going to use it if you want me to.

510
02:24:25,670 --> 02:24:36,389
Where is he? Where is he? Where the fuck? He came all the way down the stairs and I didn't even see

511
02:24:36,389 --> 02:25:10,250
you. Now I got 12 health. I got more. Deeper. Not yet. Hold that thought. Not deeper. That

512
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:17,479
opens somewhere else. That's definitely the door that opens when I press this button. Don't fall.

513
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:31,819
Deeper. I got stuck in the wall. Curve at the frog over here. Curve at the frog. Is it going to

514
02:25:31,819 --> 02:25:45,750
kill me? All right. So let's get this going. I'm going for it. I'm going to move quick.

515
02:25:46,709 --> 02:26:28,180
Ah. Oh, she spits. Where are you? Who's left? There's somebody left apparently. Where,

516
02:26:30,780 --> 02:27:01,750
where are they? I have 14 health. Where are you? That's not health.

517
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:16,280
Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man.

518
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:38,309
Where you at? Where? Where is he? What is it? What is it? What's, what's, what's chasing me?

519
02:27:38,870 --> 02:27:55,059
Give me all that stuff. I gotta use the assault rifle. Max ammo on it. Always use the thing you

520
02:27:55,059 --> 02:28:14,469
have that has max ammo. That's a tip from a professional video game player. See? There's

521
02:28:14,469 --> 02:28:28,920
my key. Super health. That's the red key for the red door. The owl clove opens. Where's the owl

522
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:47,139
clove? You want to help me out here? It's above you. Oh, wait, is there a secret up there?

523
02:28:48,100 --> 02:29:52,389
No, the owl clove opens. Oh, you idiot. That's convenient. What the fuck? That's convenient.

524
02:30:08,899 --> 02:30:22,120
Didn't find a secret. I got a couple of them. Is that beavis or butt head?

525
02:30:23,639 --> 02:30:34,069
Both of them at the same time. Uh oh. Open environment. It's time to show off our skills.

526
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:53,909
You missed a secret. I don't care. I shouldn't have done that. Uh oh, here comes the army.

527
02:30:55,379 --> 02:31:08,139
Sword only. Just kidding. That's a lie. Watch out for the, I was gonna say Burger King frog.

528
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:28,500
That, there's no, there's no Burger King frog, right? Okay, that's wave one. Let's, uh,

529
02:31:28,500 --> 02:32:14,489
that's activated. Cool. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, why don't you make it hard for me?

530
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:47,750
I mean, you didn't read the biography of my character beforehand, unfortunately. You didn't

531
02:32:47,750 --> 02:32:50,950
read the biography that says like, oh, watch out when he gets the sniper rifle. Don't go at him.

532
02:32:51,670 --> 02:33:01,399
He's fucking lit with the sniper rifle. I got hit once. Yo, boohoo, got hit one time.

533
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:13,770
I, oh, he's a 99 percentile. I actually like this. This is fun. All right, let's do it with

534
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:30,069
the crossbow. What's hitting me? Oh, what happened? Okay. That was bullshit. I didn't even see them.

535
02:33:30,629 --> 02:33:37,659
I didn't even see them. The problem is, I mean, what was I thinking? That's the problem right here.

536
02:33:37,659 --> 02:34:18,340
These things are following me around in a circle. Let's get some health. Good. Over here, health.

537
02:34:21,659 --> 02:34:31,510
All right. Cool. Let's do some mortars. Good job, Jerma, you fucking stupid dipshit idiot.

538
02:34:32,549 --> 02:34:47,180
Okay, I got everything I needed. Let's just activate the last one. What about in the

539
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:56,569
cathedral area itself? I think there's probably some things I didn't get. Yeah, there's some health

540
02:34:56,569 --> 02:35:07,020
back here. Just making sure I get it all. All right, last one. Where is it? Mob that guy?

541
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:19,510
Don't mob that person. There's no reason to. It's not that one. I already got that one

542
02:35:20,389 --> 02:36:29,079
back here. No, I got this one too. Where is it? There it is. Open. It's time for the final battle.

543
02:36:29,959 --> 02:36:36,889
Whatever the hell's in here. Something's in here. Lots of shotgun ammo.

544
02:36:40,250 --> 02:36:46,170
There it is. All right. I think, I think this is going to throw 10 times what I've done already

545
02:36:46,170 --> 02:37:10,659
at me right now. When I press this button. Shoot this. I did it. The rising wind brings the stench

546
02:37:10,659 --> 02:37:39,139
of rotten meat. Yeah. Okay. Uh, should I get out of here? No, that's a, how do I get away from the

547
02:37:39,139 --> 02:38:17,209
tornado? It's coming for me. Do I have to leave the area? Let's go. Where is it? Okay. I have to go

548
02:38:17,209 --> 02:38:30,979
around it. It's, it's changing trajectory. It's changing trajectory. Oh shit. Kill it. I can't,

549
02:38:30,979 --> 02:38:44,579
you can't kill a tornado. Oh my fucking God. No, I have to go around it. You can't kill a tornado.

550
02:38:45,219 --> 02:39:21,260
There's a way down. All right, here we go. Why does it know where I'm going? All right,

551
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:40,280
hurry up and go down. Wait, is there secrets in there? It's gone. Wait, this is what I'm supposed

552
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:51,139
to do. I thought that's what I was supposed to do. I thought I was supposed to escape the tornado.

553
02:39:58,170 --> 02:40:07,129
Oh, all right. I'm sure I get all this stuff. I don't know what I was supposed to do.

554
02:40:07,690 --> 02:40:17,399
I thought I was running away from the tornado. What is that? Magic egg backpack full of ammo.

555
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:45,819
Oh dear. I had 50 health. I just fell off. Okay. Well, that's a lot of you're coming up. Okay.

556
02:40:45,819 --> 02:40:55,989
That's a lot of you coming up right now. This thing pushes you back.

557
02:41:03,110 --> 02:41:05,750
He's fucking dead. Oh, I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kick his ass. I'm going to stab

558
02:41:05,750 --> 02:41:12,920
his throat in his fucking throat. And when I get up there, it's you. Funny. Fuck. I didn't have any

559
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:33,540
morale. I thought I had enough morale to do that. Oh well. You thought, you thought it was like

560
02:41:33,540 --> 02:42:08,420
funny. He went. I'm just going to kill him before they get up here. Fuck him. Where is he?

561
02:42:09,139 --> 02:42:33,780
Just shooting his shotgun from this far away. Shooting the fucking ground. This guy's freaking

562
02:42:33,780 --> 02:42:50,069
me out. Why does he not run up yet? Okay. Here we go. If he kills me again, sometimes you got to

563
02:42:50,069 --> 02:43:09,799
just go in. Good. All right. Now we've got a door here. We've got a secret spot here. No.

564
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:46,600
You can take a lot of hits. It's all right though. Save it right here. Get in. I don't have a fucking

565
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:54,700
morale. Just kill me. I thought I had, why did I lose morale? 49 morale. Who? That doesn't give me

566
02:43:54,700 --> 02:44:33,350
morale. Why are you even putting it on your bar? Now I got morale. Give me that. Well, I didn't

567
02:44:33,350 --> 02:44:40,899
find it because I can't get it. I mean, sure. I found it, but I can't reach in there and get it.

568
02:44:41,780 --> 02:45:16,219
Get out of the way. I thought these would flush the whole way. I thought they, I thought they would

569
02:45:16,219 --> 02:45:21,579
flush. Every time I looked at it, it was like that right there. This is connected right there.

570
02:45:21,579 --> 02:45:30,389
I'm moving around quickly and I thought it was connected or whatever. It's fine. All right. Where

571
02:45:30,389 --> 02:45:39,930
am I going? Uh, get the super pistols. Not yet. All right. Super pistols and the door go.

572
02:45:41,290 --> 02:45:46,069
There's nothing in here to do this with. Okay. Keep going. Find something to do. Find something

573
02:45:46,069 --> 02:46:07,940
to kill. Quick. Find somebody to shoot at. Find anybody. Got him. I still don't have any keys.

574
02:46:08,819 --> 02:46:29,430
Did I miss a key? Wait, do I have a key? No. Oh, there's a door. I would have loved that

575
02:46:29,430 --> 02:46:56,729
fucking special movie. That was absolutely deranged. Yeah, I know. What would it say?

576
02:47:00,709 --> 02:47:09,639
What am I going to tell you? Sorry. I was like, I was in the middle of talking.

577
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:17,459
I was like, oh, that's going to be, and then somebody just grabbed my sides and like squeezed

578
02:47:17,459 --> 02:47:48,620
really hard. Like a squeaky toy. Red key. What happened? Why did I put it away? Why are they

579
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:52,780
freaking me out? Which way are they going? Okay. I gotta slow down. Wait, wait, wait. Why are you

580
02:47:52,780 --> 02:47:59,420
taking out the signals? Why are the signals out? Okay. I saved it. I seriously, why is the signal

581
02:47:59,420 --> 02:48:05,450
coming out? What was that all about? I like took this out and then all of a sudden the

582
02:48:05,450 --> 02:48:13,930
signals got replaced and I lost all the health I had. That's so, so, uh, I'm actually upset right

583
02:48:13,930 --> 02:48:21,540
now, but it's all right. Well, that's what the problem was. All right. If you don't, if there's

584
02:48:21,540 --> 02:48:25,299
zero ammo in your gun, if you click, it just switches immediately to the next one. That was

585
02:48:25,299 --> 02:48:57,420
the problem. That's when I got all fucked up. Where are these fools? Fool. That was fucking

586
02:48:57,420 --> 02:49:20,780
really fast. Anybody else play video games here? Wait, I don't want to go through that yet.

587
02:49:21,500 --> 02:49:29,989
Wasn't there a red one up here? I remember that being a red door and be going red door,

588
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:37,270
secret red door or something, right? Or am I making that up? No, I told you I wasn't making it up.

589
02:49:46,950 --> 02:50:09,209
Riveter unlocked. I'm not going that way yet. It's just a, so that's the door I was thinking of. Okay.

590
02:50:09,209 --> 02:50:20,979
Okay. Nothing in the crossbow, hunting rifle. Let's just move. This game is cool.

591
02:50:20,979 --> 02:50:32,819
Laugh my ass off. Yeah, I know. Let it come through. Three, two, one, go.

592
02:50:35,510 --> 02:50:47,260
What the hell? What was that? Don't watch it come all the way down, dummy.

593
02:50:48,860 --> 02:51:27,959
Because I knew he was right here. There's like four of them here. I have to start using these.

594
02:51:27,959 --> 02:51:38,379
Always use the one with max ammo and then collect ammo and then fight a boss with 40 health. Sounds

595
02:51:38,379 --> 02:52:01,690
like a plan to me. Oh, you didn't even check behind the portal. I know the effects of the

596
02:52:01,690 --> 02:52:14,200
fast fire totem will stack. So what you're saying is pistols get both fast fire things and just go

597
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:42,200
spam. I'll take it. Where am I? Okay. Where am I? Where am I? All right. We're good. I'm going to

598
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:58,659
do too much. I gotta stop drinking coffee. Save it. I know my large coffees. I thought that was a

599
02:52:58,659 --> 02:53:15,219
guy. All right. Hold on. Where are these motherfuckers? Yeah, good. You got your cameo.

600
02:53:15,219 --> 02:53:47,139
You got, you got to be on camera. All right. I still hear somebody. There's a lot of stuff in

601
02:53:47,139 --> 02:53:52,420
the way though. There's a lot of things to pick up and a lot of places to go. Why don't we check out

602
02:53:52,420 --> 02:53:57,700
down here? Look at that. Super bullets or something. I know. Okay. I'll take it. Sure.

603
02:53:57,700 --> 02:54:19,049
What's up there? Who cares? Welcome to hell. Secret. Oh, what's on the other side?

604
02:54:20,010 --> 02:54:47,620
I have bees. What's that? Another sword. I can go down here. Can I? Oh shit. Okay.

605
02:54:51,979 --> 02:54:55,260
Red door. Wait, that's not a red door. Yes, it is. I have a red key. What are you dumb?

606
02:54:56,059 --> 02:55:23,690
Back in the back of my mouse hole. Back in the mouse hole. Too many of them got

607
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:56,920
they got killed by a creeper. Oh my god. Fuck. Okay. Go up. Look at how much that is there.

608
02:55:56,920 --> 02:56:10,260
But wait. What the hell? What? The reason why I'm opening all these doors at the same time.

609
02:56:10,819 --> 02:57:30,250
Like a dope. You can't be serious with me. What? Retreat. Oh, what is in here? I shot over his head.

610
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:50,969
You got lucky. You on the other hand are still alive. Blue key. I'm kind of running an ammo.

611
02:57:51,530 --> 02:58:24,170
I need every bit of health I can get right now. And there's still those guys here.

612
02:58:24,809 --> 02:58:46,819
The frogs are still here somewhere. I can't slide under there. Fuck it. Whatever. I think I'm just

613
02:58:46,819 --> 02:58:58,659
gonna go. I hate hearing that breathing sound. The heavy breathing drives me crazy because I know

614
02:58:58,659 --> 02:59:10,329
somebody's here. This health and this ammo right here. Just fuck it. This rain health.

615
02:59:12,629 --> 02:59:40,819
Sure. I guess. Whatever. Where is it? Where are you? I can hear his like stretchy pants.

616
02:59:41,459 --> 02:59:53,139
Can you hear him? He's like spandex. Hey, you're the coolest fucking person I know. You're the

617
02:59:53,139 --> 03:00:04,299
coolest person. Just step on the gas all the way down and flood your engine with gas and just go

618
03:00:04,299 --> 03:00:11,829
really fast for five seconds. It's so awesome. You're so cool for doing that. Everything about

619
03:00:11,829 --> 03:00:20,620
you. I wish I could meet you and hang out with you. I would assume that that person speaks in

620
03:00:20,620 --> 03:00:32,969
one word sentences. Yeah. You like going real fast, huh? Yes. Okay. You know that's like you

621
03:00:32,969 --> 03:00:55,100
can really like hurt somebody. I don't know. Oh, okay. But I go fast. Cool. Great. I hate sharing

622
03:00:55,100 --> 03:01:13,370
the road with you. This place is condemned. Oh, there he is. Whoa. Don't look at me. Don't look

623
03:01:13,370 --> 03:01:19,750
at me. Don't look at me. I don't have any clothes on. Where are my clothes? This is a nightmare.

624
03:01:19,750 --> 03:01:46,219
I'm in a nightmare. Fuck you. It's doing the like super pog face. I'm gonna die. I have to.

625
03:01:46,219 --> 03:01:48,700
Okay. What do I want to use? Hunting rifle? There's another one down here.

626
03:01:49,659 --> 03:02:31,110
I think it's right behind. It's right behind the door. Nothing. Is he dead? He's dead.

627
03:02:31,110 --> 03:02:38,549
There's another one though. Shit. Is that right there? Oh, no. Not this stuff. Not like this.

628
03:02:40,729 --> 03:02:54,069
All right. Shotgun time. All right. I'm gonna put, I'm gonna block the doors so he can't go

629
03:02:54,069 --> 03:02:59,719
around me. He cannot go in front of me. He can only come to my left and right.

630
03:03:00,520 --> 03:03:27,430
No, just my left. He can't go through that front door. Okay. Well, I know this is only for bosses,

631
03:03:27,430 --> 03:03:49,989
but there's rivets here. That's enough. Get the health in there. Oh shit. I don't know. Where am I

632
03:03:49,989 --> 03:04:13,670
going? Oops. Where am I? How am I? God damn it, man. God damn it. Wait, there was just a chainsaw

633
03:04:13,670 --> 03:04:19,510
guy. It wasn't even a frog. It wasn't even a frog. I can kill these guys in one shot. What a...

634
03:04:20,549 --> 03:04:28,709
Seriously, that was what I was scared of? That's what I was so scared of. Unbelievable. Not even

635
03:04:28,709 --> 03:04:40,729
a frog. But seriously though, I'm gonna do mortars, rivets for a little bit. Welcome back.

636
03:04:42,579 --> 03:04:50,280
Two and then get you with two and then get you with two. And then that's all right. You're here.

637
03:04:50,280 --> 03:04:55,319
You're right. Why would I shoot myself in the face with this? Don't ask me. I can't give you an answer.

638
03:04:56,840 --> 03:05:21,559
All right. Let's move. There's one in here. Good. I need to do the slows. I want the health.

639
03:05:24,549 --> 03:05:33,340
Rivets right there. I know you're gonna... Are you serious? Check. Turn. Why aren't you turning?

640
03:05:33,340 --> 03:05:59,559
Turn. Excuse me. All right. Let's move. That's good. Now we've got to... I'm gonna do just these

641
03:05:59,559 --> 03:06:36,360
shotguns. Go. No morale. Don't be... Don't make a mistake. I don't like when they do this shit.

642
03:06:36,360 --> 03:07:04,229
It's too scary. No idea if this is the right way. No, I just... You're doing the hyper cam guy voice?

643
03:07:05,190 --> 03:07:12,469
No, that's even the right way. I don't know. It could be. I don't know. Oh boy. This is where we move.

644
03:07:28,329 --> 03:07:31,770
All right. Somebody teleported though. Somebody teleported. I heard it.

645
03:07:32,569 --> 03:07:52,899
So when I go in there, I have to be ready. See? Where does this put me? All right. Let's just go

646
03:07:52,899 --> 03:08:17,610
back. All right. What's up? I guess that this is the end. Pepe hands. What? See, I even checked

647
03:08:17,610 --> 03:08:38,309
behind at this time. Nothing on here. I'm very proud of you. Press any key. Homecoming.

648
03:08:39,829 --> 03:08:59,690
Let's get to full health almost. Welcome home. Hold on. I need to... I need to put back on my

649
03:09:00,649 --> 03:09:14,549
my glued on grip from the Razer Deathadder. Yeah. You know what I'm going to say. I don't even need

650
03:09:14,549 --> 03:09:21,260
to say it. You don't know. You don't even need to know what I'm going to say. You already have heard

651
03:09:21,260 --> 03:09:29,049
it before. If you're in the store and there's two mice next to each other, one of them is a

652
03:09:29,049 --> 03:09:36,100
like $100 Razer Deathadder and the other one is like an Amazon basics $12 mouse, that's the better

653
03:09:36,100 --> 03:09:56,120
one. Like the default Microsoft mouse is better than this mouse. I'm serious. Imagine gluing on

654
03:09:56,120 --> 03:10:15,959
grips. Can you imagine that? And they can come off. All right. I got everything I needed. Wait.

655
03:10:16,920 --> 03:10:34,459
I mean, I kind of need to try. Oops. I didn't hit it.

656
03:10:38,379 --> 03:11:04,700
Why am I not dead? Hey, thanks. Wait, I'm just... That's a lot of stuff flying around.

657
03:11:05,340 --> 03:11:31,559
Oh, I got him. Nice. That... This is a secret. Is it really though? Yeah, I know. I'm playing with

658
03:11:31,559 --> 03:11:48,649
bumpers. Yes. I'm at the bowling alley and I'm... What is that sound? I heard a sound. Wait, there's

659
03:11:48,649 --> 03:11:53,770
some stuff to explore over there though. I'm not... I don't want to do this yet. I think this is like a...

660
03:11:53,770 --> 03:12:14,549
I activate that or something. Oh, it's that thing. Why use two when you can use four? All right. What

661
03:12:14,549 --> 03:12:20,379
does this do? I feel like if I touch that, I'm going to progress. I don't think I'm ready for

662
03:12:20,379 --> 03:12:28,840
progress right now. Yeah, not yet. Hold on. I got the key. I want to go and see what's over there.

663
03:12:29,399 --> 03:13:12,540
Okay. There's a house here. Stop laughing at your own jokes. Yeah. I was just... You are not fun.

664
03:13:13,100 --> 03:13:31,829
Looking for health. I hear a little jingling of keys. Hey, any key jinglers here? Am I doing it

665
03:13:31,829 --> 03:13:40,620
right? Well, sorry to intrude. Giant ball of skulls and death that lives in a regular house.

666
03:13:49,690 --> 03:13:53,770
All right. I know there's going to be another one. What's in the basement? I don't know.

667
03:13:54,569 --> 03:14:18,280
There's something in here. Look, very clearly there's a key. I think I'm supposed to touch

668
03:14:18,280 --> 03:14:24,920
all these. Why did I do that? No. Touch it again. Touch it again. Touch it again. I don't want to

669
03:14:24,920 --> 03:14:41,899
do that. No. I didn't even get to see what was in the basement. No. I didn't get to see... No. I

670
03:14:41,899 --> 03:14:48,200
never know what's going to be in the basement now. Where am I going? What the fuck is happening?

671
03:14:48,920 --> 03:15:00,299
Touch that. No. I need to touch that. Okay. I got to touch that one. I got to grab this one.

672
03:15:01,020 --> 03:15:26,899
Okay. Go this way. And where is it? Oh. Is this door open? Oh, shit. I missed it. Oh.

673
03:15:26,899 --> 03:16:02,809
Oh. I needed to be normal again. Whoops. I... Where's the world? Okay. Load the save.

674
03:16:05,350 --> 03:16:14,409
It hurts my brain so bad. Just reach that. I can't even... I need to hit that again.

675
03:16:18,950 --> 03:16:35,190
I actually think I'm fucked. I'm somehow moving further and further away. I think I can't do

676
03:16:35,190 --> 03:17:13,739
anything. I can't turn. I can't move. I can't... Wait. What? Oh. Um. Okay. I need to see what's

677
03:17:13,739 --> 03:17:54,920
in the basement. What are you doing down here, man? There's nothing in here? I guess there was

678
03:17:54,920 --> 03:18:04,040
health down here. So it wasn't even worth coming down here. Why'd you do that, dude? He was just

679
03:18:04,040 --> 03:18:15,430
fucking vibing. Well, I don't... I don't know. I don't care. All right. Now I'm going to try to...

680
03:18:15,430 --> 03:18:25,350
I have the blue key. Here we go. Ready? Flip it. And then... Which way am I standing? Okay.

681
03:18:25,350 --> 03:18:31,530
This is the way I'm standing. I'm going... All right. Where the hell am I? All right. So

682
03:18:32,569 --> 03:18:46,790
I need to get a button. So I'm no longer here. There's a button. Let's get hit by this tree.

683
03:18:49,690 --> 03:19:00,069
No! Almost had it. What about this one? Can I get hit by it? Let me get stuck here. Through this...

684
03:19:00,069 --> 03:19:28,729
All right. I'm in a new house. I hear it. Oops. All right. Well. Um. Okay. Now if I go...

685
03:19:32,360 --> 03:19:36,520
There's a switch that I have to hit. I saw it. It was over here somewhere. Like, right...

686
03:19:37,079 --> 03:20:16,120
It's right there. Where is it? Where's that switch? Oh, there was a... What was that? All right.

687
03:20:16,120 --> 03:20:20,120
In the barn is another switch, but that's just gonna make it right side up. I think I have to

688
03:20:20,120 --> 03:20:37,610
actually, like, travel around like this. All right. Where am I now? Can I get in the barn like this?

689
03:20:39,459 --> 03:21:13,829
Right there? All right. I'm in the barn. Shit. No. I can't reach that. How can I do a rivet jump?

690
03:21:13,829 --> 03:21:20,549
Ah. As I said, I'm hurting myself and not hitting it. What happens if I go through here? All right.

691
03:21:20,549 --> 03:21:29,879
There's that. But I'm not on the right plane. You know what I'm saying? I need to get, like, that way.

692
03:21:30,440 --> 03:21:45,579
So I gotta flip it. Shit. Can I... Can I get up there? Maybe I can. I'm almost lined up.

693
03:21:46,299 --> 03:21:52,870
All right. All right. All right. All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm on this island now.

694
03:21:53,430 --> 03:21:58,170
But which way am I going? I gotta go... Not quite. Not quite. Not quite. Not quite. Not...

695
03:21:59,450 --> 03:22:30,899
Just don't move. I thought I... I gotta hit that... What happens if I press this button, though?

696
03:22:31,379 --> 03:22:53,940
There's health here. Got it. What? What the fuck? What did it open? I don't even... I have no idea

697
03:22:53,940 --> 03:23:03,139
what it opened. Um, where the hell am I? Holy shit. This is the most disorienting thing I've ever done.

698
03:23:04,389 --> 03:23:17,260
Uh, I... Where am I even aiming? All right. Got one. I need to go right. I'm gonna throw up.

699
03:23:17,979 --> 03:23:24,600
I'm gonna throw up. I have to hit this and spin around. I got one shot at this.

700
03:23:26,649 --> 03:23:45,819
I didn't get it. All right. I... Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. There's a blue... I'm at the blue door.

701
03:23:46,540 --> 03:24:15,770
Okay. Let's... Let's go. Oh, no. I don't want to... Do I have to press that? Oh, no.

702
03:24:21,420 --> 03:24:26,520
Do I have to press that? Do I have to? Wait. It's like there's two of them in here.

703
03:24:28,889 --> 03:24:38,940
Just... Aye, aye, aye. What is this? The neighboring garage opens. Don't do this yet.

704
03:24:51,530 --> 03:25:01,479
These guys in here. How can I be... Hello? How can I be here? What's this screaming for?

705
03:25:09,270 --> 03:25:09,750
Somebody.

706
03:25:19,579 --> 03:25:35,430
Okay. Oh, man. So, what's the actual end goal here? What's the end game here? Computer? And

707
03:25:35,430 --> 03:25:44,489
that computer don't have time to play with myself. No, I don't. Is it to get in the barn like this?

708
03:25:46,540 --> 03:25:54,819
Or... I'm not sure what this wants me to do. Let's see. Wait. Okay. I'm upside down now.

709
03:25:54,819 --> 03:25:59,370
This one just makes you go upside down. I know this soap in there. Don't worry.

710
03:26:00,260 --> 03:26:05,639
So, if I just go upside down, that means I have to get to the upside down one like this.

711
03:26:08,520 --> 03:26:18,809
I've made it to this island. There's also another island that has stuff on it like that one. No.

712
03:26:18,809 --> 03:26:28,250
Where is it? Somewhere around here, isn't it? I know. I know about that. But wasn't there

713
03:26:28,250 --> 03:26:36,629
another one of these? Smaller, with a bunch of stuff on it? Where was that? Oh, whatever.

714
03:26:41,219 --> 03:26:50,540
I'm trying to... What? Where's my... That's the one right there. That's what I'm looking for.

715
03:26:50,540 --> 03:27:04,260
Good thing this stopped. Do it again. Yeah, I knew there was one of these. There. See?

716
03:27:04,979 --> 03:27:23,000
All right. That was worth doing. What about that? No. Okay. It's time. Just be ready.

717
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:56,309
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? I'm talking about none of those. Hit him. Dude.

718
03:28:11,209 --> 03:28:14,090
How did he get missed that many times? Look at how small this area is.

719
03:28:15,129 --> 03:28:27,719
What? Those are some... That's a pixel perfect missing, apparently. Fake health box. All right.

720
03:28:27,719 --> 03:28:46,739
Let's spin. This is going to be puke inducing. There's a key. Okay. I got to get that key.

721
03:28:49,020 --> 03:29:00,139
Yellow key. Got it? No. Yellow door. Over there. So...

722
03:29:09,500 --> 03:29:20,760
Oh, I'm at the end. That one was a little bonkers. Almost perfected. I wasn't about

723
03:29:20,760 --> 03:29:32,260
to go try to find the third secret there. That was a puke level. As above, so below.

724
03:29:32,260 --> 03:29:54,250
This is the very beginning. Oh, it's not there. What the fuck?

725
03:30:04,569 --> 03:30:13,030
Okay. Trying to get on this ledge. I did. But is there any... No, nothing here.

726
03:30:13,030 --> 03:30:32,149
I would put a secret here. Oh, never mind. They're all like this. Full morale. Yellow door.

727
03:30:33,190 --> 03:30:51,459
Oh, might as well fill it up. I'm going to keep the sword out for now. Never mind.

728
03:30:56,020 --> 03:30:58,899
Would have loved to have picked up that hunting rifle ammo.

729
03:30:58,899 --> 03:31:38,040
Health. I'll take a secret. Ooh, nice. Yes. That's exactly what I wanted. Thank you.

730
03:31:43,750 --> 03:32:01,500
Break it. Why can't... Rivet gun. Save it. I'm probably nearing the end of the episode.

731
03:32:02,219 --> 03:32:08,840
What is it? 10 episodes? 10 levels per episode? Something like that. Let's get up there.

732
03:32:08,840 --> 03:32:44,229
Okay, switch guns. That was dumb. Ready, go! I hear a lady.

733
03:32:51,510 --> 03:33:19,829
There's two of them. Go into the light, Jeremy. I didn't plan on it. All right, I'm going to have...

734
03:33:20,469 --> 03:33:43,979
Let's do these two on switch. Oh, boy. Never mind. Oh, boy. Why?

735
03:33:45,739 --> 03:33:56,969
Please die. Please die. Please die. This game is so stressful, but it's so fun.

736
03:33:57,610 --> 03:34:38,940
Where are you? All right, I want shotgun and mortars for my switches. Godlike.

737
03:34:44,469 --> 03:35:22,729
And then I go and do something like that. Give me health. What was that? What is... Who's firing

738
03:35:22,729 --> 03:35:34,200
in here? It's you! I just saved it right there. Save it down here because I don't want to die there.

739
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:55,239
Oh, my fuck. She's coming down the stairs, man. Don't blow that up. It's gonna hit me.

740
03:35:56,600 --> 03:36:17,579
I hate these things. I can go get those. What do I have for a... Yeah, I'm gonna get crossbow ammo.

741
03:36:18,299 --> 03:36:23,319
Okay, there's a fire... There's a Mario slide portion of this level coming up right here.

742
03:36:23,319 --> 03:36:40,040
But let me get everything. There's another person. How's are they in? Are they in here with me?

743
03:36:44,250 --> 03:36:52,040
What? Open. What's the point of this? What's the point of that? What's the point of this?

744
03:36:54,090 --> 03:37:20,540
I don't think there's a point. All right, secret health, but I don't need it.

745
03:37:31,270 --> 03:37:53,899
Okay, I see where you are. I see where you are. Holy shit! Okay, we're just bombing it. Hello?

746
03:37:55,399 --> 03:38:16,549
Oh! What happened there? One, two, three. Great. Where were you? I don't... Guys,

747
03:38:16,549 --> 03:38:20,579
she was in the bottom floor of the house. How many times did I pass you?

748
03:38:20,579 --> 03:38:43,129
Did she go up a tree? Oh, something activated.

749
03:38:45,270 --> 03:38:55,079
All right, don't go in here yet. I want to take care of this shit. Let's get in here. Same deal.

750
03:38:56,379 --> 03:39:10,340
Now I can chill and bomb it. That's gonna hurt me, isn't it? What the fuck just happened?

751
03:39:12,700 --> 03:39:40,299
What just happened? Fuck it, we're going in. People are in here. There's so many people in here.

752
03:39:41,020 --> 03:40:05,940
There's so many people. All right, there's like three of those whispering ladies in here.

753
03:40:07,959 --> 03:40:36,180
Now, what does this get me? I heard a beep. All right, interesting. Anything else in here?

754
03:40:36,899 --> 03:40:45,780
Wait, this just takes me all the way back to... Wait, what? Why would I want to come back here?

755
03:40:46,579 --> 03:41:05,500
This is the... Oh, the fuck? Hold on. H-E-I. No, that's right. That's where this yellow key is.

756
03:41:05,659 --> 03:41:15,079
All right. Well, let's get the hell out of here. Guys, what is going on right now? Where the fuck

757
03:41:15,079 --> 03:41:35,559
am I going? What just happened? This is like really, really far away. What? I'm so confused.

758
03:41:35,559 --> 03:41:44,090
This may as well have been six hours ago. All right, here's the house. All right, I made it.

759
03:41:45,129 --> 03:41:49,530
All right, so that was not the way I should have... Okay, I have to get... Right, right, right.

760
03:41:49,530 --> 03:42:09,799
But I gotta get the... I gotta go down here. I don't have very much time to use this.

761
03:42:13,659 --> 03:42:31,350
Is it just death down there? I think that you just die. I gotta find out. I'm not sure I'm

762
03:42:31,350 --> 03:42:34,389
supposed to do that. I mean, why would I be able to come all the way down here though?

763
03:42:39,319 --> 03:42:51,909
There's nowhere else to go. I knew it. I knew it. So what was the point of this? Is that a secret?

764
03:42:51,909 --> 03:43:24,010
I guess. He's answering himself. I guess I go... I didn't get a yellow key yet,

765
03:43:24,649 --> 03:43:29,829
and that's what I'm looking for. Was there a yellow key somewhere up here that I missed?

766
03:43:30,389 --> 03:43:35,059
Like through here? Because this wraps all the way around. Don't go down.

767
03:43:35,860 --> 03:44:06,170
Just go across. All right, maybe this is the way to go. Trust your eyes. Now we're all the way back

768
03:44:06,170 --> 03:44:35,159
again where we were last time. I'm just going to rocket jump up. What the... Oh, it's the wrong

769
03:44:35,159 --> 03:45:15,290
button. Wrong one. It's this one. Keep moving. Where are you? I can hear you. Where is he? Above

770
03:45:15,290 --> 03:45:54,649
me? There you are. There you are. Oh, and you came through the door. Those things move a lot.

771
03:46:13,940 --> 03:46:38,700
Oh, he hit me right in the face. Jesus. This dog... Stress. Stress. Stress. Stress. Stress.

772
03:46:39,500 --> 03:46:45,850
Stress him out. Stress him out. Stress him out. Stress him out. Stress him out. What else do we

773
03:46:45,850 --> 03:46:49,290
got? Anything? Any more food here for me to... for my guns? Any more food for my guns?

774
03:46:50,540 --> 03:47:03,370
Yes, there is. And food gun. Maxon hunting rifle. There we go. Wait, what's this?

775
03:47:04,250 --> 03:47:50,629
Weird little door back here. I can hear you wailing. There you are. This is a long stairway.

776
03:47:51,510 --> 03:48:19,319
What's this? Cast machine? I guess there's some stuff down here. Hey! Where is he? He's in the

777
03:48:19,319 --> 03:48:31,129
teleporter. Great. He's lighting his shotgun up to my head. He was just waiting for me.

778
03:48:32,010 --> 03:49:04,600
All right, give me a second. Well, I'm trying to... I didn't... Didn't I get another key?

779
03:49:05,559 --> 03:49:18,469
I swear I did. Somebody's sprinting down here, I think. You're not. We're good.

780
03:49:20,360 --> 03:49:45,579
You eat 5G gum? I'm chewing 5G gum. All right, that's real funny. I mean, just hilarious, dude.

781
03:49:46,219 --> 03:49:54,020
Absolutely hysterical. Funniest person. Hey, actually, it's a shortcut. Thanks for the

782
03:49:54,020 --> 03:50:32,440
shortcut. Appreciate it. Good. Sweet. You want to play that game? I can play that game.

783
03:50:34,520 --> 03:50:46,760
Get out of here. Take that. Memories dry and crumble.

784
03:50:54,459 --> 03:51:04,739
This game's too hard for you? I'm about to finish the game on the hardest difficulty.

785
03:51:05,379 --> 03:51:18,010
What are you talking about? Yeah, I think you should, like, I think you should, like, put...

786
03:51:19,530 --> 03:51:24,090
You gotta throw in the towel, man. You're, like, you're, like, 42 minutes from beating the whole

787
03:51:24,090 --> 03:51:28,010
game on the second hardest difficulty. I think, you know, maybe you should throw in the towel now.

788
03:51:28,010 --> 03:51:48,809
This is time for you to throw in the towel. Yeah, now is it. Do it now. Where is it? What the hell

789
03:51:48,809 --> 03:51:57,959
is he? He's freaking me out wherever he is. Why did you even fit through the door? Why did he even

790
03:51:57,959 --> 03:52:12,329
get in the door? He's really... You can't fit through there, man. No way. You don't fit through

791
03:52:12,329 --> 03:52:55,239
that door. Let's go. Okay. Take out both of these. Now, watch out for the dog.

792
03:52:56,760 --> 03:53:20,620
I don't even know where he came from. He kind of just showed up. Where is he? He's gonna...

793
03:53:21,979 --> 03:54:07,000
Through this wall. Okay, got you. Oh! He can hit me through the grate. Sorry. I just negated

794
03:54:07,000 --> 03:54:18,459
everything he just did. Stop commentating. Just win the game. This streaming shit is distracting

795
03:54:18,459 --> 03:54:26,120
you. All right, I'll turn... Let me turn my stream off for a few hours, guys. I'll see you later.

796
03:54:30,709 --> 03:54:32,389
Dude, you need to turn off your stream.

797
03:54:35,180 --> 03:54:40,629
Did I really just get a, dude, turn off your stream comment? Did that really just happen?

798
03:54:45,510 --> 03:54:56,860
Dude, just turn off your stream. What the fuck? All right, hold on. I got... I'm ready to move

799
03:54:56,860 --> 03:55:07,299
forward. Dude, this streaming thing is like... You gotta just complete the circle. I have to...

800
03:55:07,940 --> 03:55:42,870
But this is the beginning of the game. Dweller in the darkness. Okay. I mean, you can clearly see

801
03:55:42,870 --> 03:56:24,379
that. Oh, you're gonna give me a soap? Don't give me a soap right before one of the last boss?

802
03:56:25,100 --> 03:56:38,090
Am I actually gonna get a soap here? Holy shit. This is a lot of stuff. Okay.

803
03:56:38,969 --> 03:56:40,569
Just remember... Okay. Let's go.

804
03:57:00,040 --> 03:57:09,579
Holy fuck. All right. What's a better hunting rifle? No.

805
03:57:10,940 --> 03:57:43,299
Salt rifle. Yeah. Take out a little guys first. That's planned. Just spawning still.

806
03:57:44,819 --> 03:58:43,799
Oh, it hit me. Found the sword. Good. Now what? Oh, all right. Let's keep... Let's keep... It

807
03:58:43,799 --> 03:58:54,780
keeps rolling. It keeps rolling. It keeps rolling. Fuck. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Give me this...

808
03:59:23,260 --> 03:59:57,909
Go up. Holy... Thanks for the help, man. Don't kill me. Oh my god. There's so many of those

809
03:59:57,909 --> 04:00:05,020
bullets firing over at me. Oh, there's so many of these bullets firing over here.

810
04:00:16,649 --> 04:00:31,420
Oh no. No. I didn't save the... I didn't save the game. Oh shit. God. That's insane.

811
04:00:33,239 --> 04:00:40,219
All right. Fuck. That's hard. I gotta do the same thing from before. Let's go.

812
04:00:41,100 --> 04:00:52,069
But different. Here we go. Watch this. I have a better strategy than this.

813
04:00:52,950 --> 04:00:59,079
Salt rifle is not good for this. I really should just... No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

814
04:00:59,079 --> 04:01:08,809
No. Kill me. Kill me. Bad start. Kill me. Kill me. I'm gonna use the... I think I'm just gonna use

815
04:01:08,809 --> 04:01:15,000
hunting rifle. No. No. No. No. What am I gonna do here? What do I want to use? Crossbow?

816
04:01:15,000 --> 04:01:30,149
Maybe the crossbow. I need crossbow ammo. Is there even crossbow ammo here?

817
04:01:31,270 --> 04:01:37,219
I wonder if I... Can I actually take a second? Probably not.

818
04:01:50,020 --> 04:01:56,889
I think I'm just tilted from the last round. Yeah, that's absolutely what's happening.

819
04:01:58,329 --> 04:02:20,489
Bye. All right. All right. Start over. Regain strength. I'm gonna do the same thing at the

820
04:02:20,489 --> 04:02:29,930
last time. Salt rifle. Get rid of the guys on the ground. Salt rifle. Get rid of the guys on the

821
04:02:29,930 --> 04:02:36,059
ground. Let me see how... Does this just activate if I walk forward? Or can I actually look around

822
04:02:36,059 --> 04:02:40,149
for a second? Now I get the music starting, right? Yeah. Okay. You just have to go.

823
04:02:41,430 --> 04:03:06,899
If that ran into anyone, holy fuck. That was kind of a mistake. That's like too much.

824
04:03:08,120 --> 04:03:21,659
Yeah. That's way too much. Too quick. Where's my... Just hit six. Give me a break.

825
04:03:21,899 --> 04:03:46,739
God damn it. Oh, fuck. I got all the time in the world. Don't rush it.

826
04:03:48,100 --> 04:04:04,360
I'm gonna leave one person alive. That's the strategy here. Okay. Let's pick up some shit.

827
04:04:05,559 --> 04:04:09,690
Did I actually get hit by the one fucking little asshole that's right here?

828
04:04:10,409 --> 04:04:24,280
Okay. Got health. Oh, this is over here. Morrell. Okay. What's up next?

829
04:04:24,920 --> 04:04:35,209
I gotta be ready for it. Up next is... All right. That's a good save point. I think I'm gonna do...

830
04:04:36,329 --> 04:04:41,190
Let's just go. I think it's... I don't remember, but we'll just fucking deal with it when it happens.

831
04:04:42,069 --> 04:05:36,379
Oh, it's a shotgun guys, right? Oh my fucking lord. That's a lot of people. Fuck you twice.

832
04:05:37,979 --> 04:05:59,350
Fuck you a third time. Ah. I'm not prepared for what's next. What is next? It's just these idiots.

833
04:06:00,149 --> 04:07:01,540
What is he? Stupid. I almost had an ammo. Okay. Now it's just the mad scientists that are running at

834
04:07:01,540 --> 04:07:31,620
me. I can handle this. I need ammo for a gun. Is that it? What's that? The invisible. The invisible.

835
04:07:31,620 --> 04:08:17,299
Invisible. Invisible. Invisible. Invisible. Invisible. Everybody sick? Everybody getting

836
04:08:17,299 --> 04:09:27,719
sick? I was getting sick. I had to stop. Oh my fuck. That's a bad idea right now. Whoa. You're

837
04:09:27,799 --> 04:09:48,700
spawning on me, bro. You're spawning. I'm gonna charge up over there. Oh. It's too many. It's too

838
04:09:48,700 --> 04:10:05,659
much. It's too much. It's too much, man. It's too much. Oh, I can't even... You can't even slow down

839
04:10:05,659 --> 04:10:28,040
either. You can't even slow down. I'm dead. Oh my god. Oh, man. Oh, man. Okay. I have to start

840
04:10:28,040 --> 04:10:35,610
saving it. Oh, okay. Slow down. Fuck me. Oh, yeah. Right this part with the fucking animals.

841
04:10:37,239 --> 04:11:14,520
Where are they? Dude, jumping like this is gonna give me a fucking brain aneurysm. It's gonna run.

842
04:11:27,129 --> 04:11:31,780
These guys. I'll do anything with these guys. These guys.

843
04:11:33,049 --> 04:11:47,739
Oh, fuck. I have to do this for a second. You can't do that for that long without having your hands

844
04:11:47,739 --> 04:12:39,059
come off the keyboard. I'm gonna just snipe. It's much easier. Now we have to do this stuff.

845
04:12:39,059 --> 04:12:43,059
It's crossbow time. Don't get overwhelmed. Just get them all before they spawn. Get them all when

846
04:12:43,059 --> 04:13:48,819
they spawn. Damn it. Okay. Fuck. I gotta use the shotgun for a little bit. Oh,

847
04:13:55,219 --> 04:14:00,659
how are you still alive, man? What a flying goddamn diaper.

848
04:14:08,790 --> 04:14:14,860
I've expelled like all my energy. I don't have any energy left. I just quick saved and got hit

849
04:14:14,860 --> 04:14:23,020
in the air by this fucking dog. I hope that's it. That's not it. Save it right here. Oh my god,

850
04:14:23,020 --> 04:14:37,209
please. Save it right here. What is it? What is it? I don't understand. Is it the dog?

851
04:14:39,909 --> 04:15:13,530
It's rats. They're just on the ground. I'm not gonna kill the last one. This is my break. Okay,

852
04:15:13,530 --> 04:15:30,969
this is my break. Any other items that I can pick up and get health? Rats, rats, rats, rats.

853
04:15:32,170 --> 04:15:41,260
I want to get into this next little... Where is he? I can hear him. He's gonna probably kill me.

854
04:15:41,260 --> 04:15:47,139
Imagine if he killed me. I would cry on stream. I would turn the webcam on and just cry for you

855
04:15:47,139 --> 04:16:09,450
guys. Okay, and 84 health. There he is. All these bullets. 86 health. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.

856
04:16:09,450 --> 04:16:49,299
Whatever it is. See ya. Go left, left, left. I have to go to the bathroom. I'm gonna pee.

857
04:16:50,260 --> 04:17:01,110
Yeah, I gotta pee. Even if I do it, I have to pee. I should be okay though. Although I'm at 11 health.

858
04:17:04,760 --> 04:17:17,620
Oh yeah, I have to pee. And I need a break, man. I'll be right back. I gotta pee.

859
04:19:28,860 --> 04:19:42,219
Dude, the temperature in this room is probably like 95 degrees. I'm heating up this room.

860
04:19:42,860 --> 04:19:52,100
Fucking intense, man. All right, let's go. I shook around a little bit. I stretched.

861
04:19:53,299 --> 04:19:59,719
Whoa. All right, where are we at? Oh yeah, it's just a rat. Just a rat. Okay, so the next thing

862
04:19:59,719 --> 04:20:08,489
that comes up is the chainsaw guys, which are one shot with this gun. All right, let me see if that

863
04:20:08,489 --> 04:20:38,950
helps. You're not dead? I'm just gonna hit by a double-barreled shotgun. Oops.

864
04:20:42,680 --> 04:20:50,360
No, you can't. If you stop moving, you are dead. You're just dead. Like, you gotta just keep the

865
04:20:50,360 --> 04:21:15,139
hook. Hook. Hook. Hook. Or you're just dead. Guaranteed dead. What's that? What's that? What's

866
04:21:15,139 --> 04:21:22,219
that? What? I just, what happened? I thought that was a new enemy. Oh, it's swordsmen and ladies.

867
04:21:33,260 --> 04:21:40,860
Oh man, this is not good. And it's the ladies. I just stay on the outside. Oh fuck, man. Okay,

868
04:21:40,860 --> 04:21:44,059
I gotta relax. I even know how the hell do you relax like this.

869
04:21:51,659 --> 04:22:10,709
They're just like kind of killing each other. Y'all think I'm gonna be crazy. You think it's

870
04:22:10,709 --> 04:22:21,530
gonna be I'm crazy, but I'm gonna get. No, not yet. Okay. Look at all this health everywhere.

871
04:22:28,329 --> 04:22:53,510
Ah, just pick it all up quick. Watchers up the gate. Oh, oh shit. This health pack in the middle.

872
04:22:53,510 --> 04:23:00,629
I gotta go in the middle. I gotta go in the middle. I gotta get this health pack in the middle.

873
04:23:02,469 --> 04:23:04,299
Oh, I can't do that. That's not gonna happen.

874
04:23:29,270 --> 04:23:32,469
Health pack. Health pack. Health pack. Holy fuck. I'm dead. No.

875
04:23:37,979 --> 04:24:01,780
He's still bouncing around. Yeah. All right. What about this like this guy, this like Jason?

876
04:24:03,450 --> 04:24:08,420
Nope. Down. All right. I'm gonna take out. I don't even know what I'm gonna do here to get

877
04:24:08,420 --> 04:24:13,700
this health if I can. I gotta take out one of the horses. Yeah, dude. The horse has gotta go first.

878
04:24:16,420 --> 04:24:19,780
Like they just got a great. I'm glad I walked in this killing.

879
04:24:20,579 --> 04:24:33,909
Don't no, no, no, no. We got really goodness gracious. This is on. This is ridiculous.

880
04:24:35,420 --> 04:24:41,510
This dialed up by a thousand. Whatever my ammo.

881
04:24:45,989 --> 04:25:24,729
Imagine if you still have the soap. Don't remind me of my failure. It wasn't bad. Trying to get the

882
04:25:24,729 --> 04:26:02,299
dogs. Oh, that hurt. Oh, that was, that was insane. That was ridiculous. That was fuck crazy.

883
04:26:02,940 --> 04:26:18,489
That was fun. But that was nuts. Can you imagine playing that if you get hit once you die?

884
04:26:20,309 --> 04:26:24,870
Taking, you die, you die in one hit. Oh, I would, I don't know if I'd be able to do that one.

885
04:26:24,870 --> 04:26:38,149
Let's make sure I got everything. Even every little tiny little crumb of every crust of health.

886
04:26:38,950 --> 04:27:01,020
I'm picking it up. Okay. There it is. So now what? Just through the door. Okay.

887
04:27:12,649 --> 04:27:28,149
Damn. What was the one secret? What did I miss? It was the thing at the start.

888
04:27:30,760 --> 04:27:56,100
What? I could have actually done that. Dusk. Okay. I've got ammo in the house away.

889
04:27:59,049 --> 04:28:02,489
Crystal. Left crystal of madness. I'm not doing that.

890
04:28:04,569 --> 04:28:18,600
I'm not going to lift up the crystal of madness just yet.

891
04:28:24,069 --> 04:28:26,069
Stuff that's in there. Just want to make sure I have everything.

892
04:28:27,879 --> 04:29:12,280
Is this the actual final final battle? What's up here? I would, I would make a comment on it,

893
04:29:12,280 --> 04:29:18,760
but why would I end? Guys, there's a soap here. Why could I use the soap and whip it into the

894
04:29:18,760 --> 04:29:28,819
last box? Okay. Let's keep the soap over there for emergency scenario.

895
04:29:30,260 --> 04:29:52,760
Now let's go pick up that crystal over here. All right. It's been a fun game.

896
04:29:54,040 --> 04:30:19,690
It's time to see how it ends. Are you going to come out of there or do I have to go in?

897
04:30:19,690 --> 04:30:53,420
And with my soap, you finally arrived. You shall be my final test.

898
04:31:01,049 --> 04:31:54,440
That started quickly. Jacob. I got to be moving already. You finally arrived. You

899
04:31:55,079 --> 04:32:10,069
shall be my final test. I'm going too fast.

900
04:32:12,709 --> 04:32:15,719
Okay. That was a mistake.

901
04:32:58,760 --> 04:33:48,490
Kill him. Unworthy. Unworthy. Just in case I saw off lock myself. He was worthy and he accomplished

902
04:33:50,139 --> 04:33:53,020
there. You should stop streaming. This game's not for you.

903
04:34:06,759 --> 04:34:11,299
Who did you expect at the end of all of this?

904
04:34:12,900 --> 04:34:22,759
God, the devil, perhaps it's just me.

905
04:34:23,479 --> 04:34:39,619
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who is this? Okay. I need to, um, I found a secret.

906
04:34:39,619 --> 04:34:54,700
How do you kill this guy under over his, in his glue, in his body, in his face,

907
04:34:55,580 --> 04:35:11,700
explosives, the light, the light. What's going on? I need to get him in the light.

908
04:35:12,500 --> 04:35:21,450
Okay. I need to save it like right when he's about to be done talking.

909
04:35:30,139 --> 04:35:48,409
He was worthy and he accomplished so. You who were faster. You.

910
04:35:48,409 --> 04:35:52,409
I can't save it. I have to save it while I'm falling.

911
04:35:53,779 --> 04:35:57,060
Who did you expect at the end of all of this?

912
04:35:58,659 --> 04:36:10,619
God, it's just me. It's just me. And here we go.

913
04:36:10,619 --> 04:36:41,319
Oh, damn it. What? That's what you do. Got it. Okay. What? Wait, I, I, this is all this stuff

914
04:36:41,319 --> 04:36:46,700
on the particle fix. If I hurt my head, I'm like looking. All right. So there's another crack.

915
04:36:47,580 --> 04:37:00,939
All right. I don't have to do that. Okay. Okay. He swings. Then he goes to go get to jump over

916
04:37:00,939 --> 04:37:08,419
his arm. Got it again. All right. I figured it out. Oh, man. I'm going to do that a thousand

917
04:37:08,419 --> 04:37:13,930
times. It's going to end up killing me. It's all the green, man. It's messing with my brain.

918
04:37:14,889 --> 04:37:35,270
I have to restart. Just die. It's, it's all the green is causing me problems. Where is it?

919
04:37:35,270 --> 04:38:04,069
There's a light. Where's it going? Fuck. Oh, yeah. Move your hand. Move your hand.

920
04:38:05,029 --> 04:38:23,380
Fucking God, man. You didn't get it.

921
04:38:36,500 --> 04:38:50,060
How do I, can I shoot with my regular?

922
04:39:16,630 --> 04:39:19,430
I don't want it. I want to spread it equally to everybody on earth.

923
04:39:20,229 --> 04:39:39,020
How do they get pacifist? What was the secret completionist and pacifist?

924
04:39:55,459 --> 04:39:56,419
I like that last touch.

925
04:40:16,840 --> 04:40:23,990
Must always rain beneath dust.

926
04:40:31,099 --> 04:40:43,180
My brothers have escaped you. My brothers will not die in vain.

927
04:40:46,970 --> 04:41:06,740
That was really, really fun. So what did I do? It's just throw in the towel. This is not,

928
04:41:06,819 --> 04:41:23,590
this game's not for you. That's like one of my favorite comments of the whole stream.

929
04:41:30,459 --> 04:41:41,500
Like that was, it was, it was funny. So that was dusk, but I'm not done with dusk.

930
04:41:42,139 --> 04:41:48,069
There's another game mode that I want to try where you have to fight waves. I'd like to try it.

931
04:41:50,330 --> 04:41:56,340
Play the rat level. This is fine to see where I will find the secret rat level. That's fine.

932
04:42:04,680 --> 04:42:12,630
Finally. Yes. Check out amid evil. I'm going to do that next. I was looking at that actually

933
04:42:12,630 --> 04:42:22,099
last night. We're not going to play that now though. We're probably going to do that.

934
04:42:27,060 --> 04:42:41,180
Is that one of them? When you look dead. All right. Let's do endless. All right. So

935
04:42:41,180 --> 04:43:01,590
let me give you a rundown. That was, that was very, very good. Very good. 9.3.

936
04:43:07,740 --> 04:43:11,659
I had to, I was 9.4, but there was that one part with the vents. Remember I was,

937
04:43:11,659 --> 04:43:22,840
I was going up and down and I had to drop it by a point, by a tenth of a point. 9.3. That's very

938
04:43:22,840 --> 04:43:34,790
high. It is something about the shooting mechanics in this game felt just way more fun than other FPS

939
04:43:34,790 --> 04:43:41,979
games. Now I actually liked this game a lot because a lot of the old school shooters,

940
04:43:42,540 --> 04:43:50,200
they were like the cardboard cutout sprite type stuff with the 2d plane sprites.

941
04:43:51,000 --> 04:44:01,849
I actually am not a big fan of that. And I don't not, I don't hate it or anything, but just,

942
04:44:01,849 --> 04:44:11,419
I like how this game doesn't do that. It's 3d. There's no sprites like the 2d sprites. What are

943
04:44:11,419 --> 04:44:17,900
you a Gen Xer? No. The rat level is hidden in episode three map four. That's good to know.

944
04:44:19,159 --> 04:44:34,759
All right. Level select episode three map four. How do I pick the level? Do I,

945
04:44:34,759 --> 04:44:53,930
do I, can I not pick a low? Right. Okay. Episode three map four. So this is one, two, three,

946
04:44:54,650 --> 04:45:09,819
four. Not with this current loadout. I want just, just give me everything. So where is it?

947
04:45:10,540 --> 04:45:43,369
Is it hard to find? It's right there. Where are my guns? I didn't select them. How the hell did I do

948
04:45:43,369 --> 04:46:01,860
that? All right. Hold on. I need my, I need my guns. Oh, you actually have to activate them.

949
04:46:02,840 --> 04:46:38,020
I see. Okay. So where's it at? Just play until I can find it. Kind of. It's over there. It's over

950
04:46:38,020 --> 04:47:00,939
there. Why am I still crouching? There's the key. Yeah. Yellow key. Find the toilet. It's red.

951
04:47:00,939 --> 04:47:08,419
You go fast here, but it's probably a bad idea. I can't see.

952
04:47:09,299 --> 04:47:26,069
Close the door. Basement door is down here. I got all the guns in the game. Why am I?

953
04:47:27,270 --> 04:47:49,180
Now we go down. Wait. Get the chest of trust. Just for fun. All right. Down here.

954
04:47:49,819 --> 04:47:57,659
Pick up this thing. Sure thing. Go around this way. Right. And we go this way. And then we,

955
04:47:57,900 --> 04:48:08,259
all right. Through here. Quickly. Here we are. I made it. There's two guys down this hallway. I

956
04:48:08,259 --> 04:48:19,049
remember. I remember them coming down here. I remember you. There's another one. Actually,

957
04:48:19,049 --> 04:48:24,250
I think, no, it's a, it's a Wendigo. Right. From what I remember. Wasn't it a Wendigo?

958
04:48:39,270 --> 04:49:06,680
Going too fast, but I have to. Oh, please. He's dying to frog wheel. Yeah, whatever. Okay.

959
04:49:07,479 --> 04:49:11,479
Okay. I remember this part. Sort of. Kind of.

960
04:49:19,500 --> 04:49:25,700
Right. All right. You know, I'm looking for a toilet, you said. Wendigo is in this one.

961
04:49:28,150 --> 04:49:47,180
Okay. Was I not supposed to kill that? Okay. Where's my flashlight?

962
04:49:48,900 --> 04:49:53,860
I still haven't gotten my flashlight. I think I should have by now, right?

963
04:49:54,500 --> 04:50:19,509
Because I just ran through a ton, a ton of shit. Okay. There we go. We're good about this guy.

964
04:50:20,310 --> 04:50:25,380
There's nothing in here, right? Okay. Now the next part.

965
04:50:27,139 --> 04:50:35,540
Because this is the blue door. Was there another way to go?

966
04:50:39,540 --> 04:50:46,520
No. Yeah. This way. This flashlight. This blue key. Okay. Let's move.

967
04:50:46,520 --> 04:51:30,439
Okay. I think I'm close, right? It's before the toy. Don't copy pasta that. That was bad info.

968
04:51:34,580 --> 04:51:48,099
Don't copy pasta. Don't. Bad info. Let's get my crossbow ready. Activate this.

969
04:51:48,099 --> 04:52:30,069
You. And you. How are you doing? Good. Good. Forget about this part.

970
04:52:31,430 --> 04:52:37,020
Dog. Don't think he can't make it out. He can.

971
04:52:50,069 --> 04:53:33,349
That shoots room. Okay. Somebody else. Where are you? Silence. All right. Red key.

972
04:53:34,069 --> 04:53:43,049
I've got the red key. I need to go back. So do I activate this? When you go through

973
04:53:43,049 --> 04:53:46,090
the yellow door, turn left and look behind the junk for a secret switch.

974
04:53:46,729 --> 04:54:03,689
Our club is open. Brings us back to here. It's pretty rad. I don't use that term very often.

975
04:54:12,979 --> 04:54:22,459
So I'm done in here. To get back there. Go back all the way down to where I was before

976
04:54:22,540 --> 04:54:47,669
that red door. How far back was it? It was all the way up here, wasn't it? Chaos crawls to me.

977
04:54:48,869 --> 04:55:19,880
Right. Okay. What does it now? Look. Is it back down here? Is it? I can't get back up here through

978
04:55:19,880 --> 04:55:47,779
here. He found the strawberry room. Did I miss it back up here? All right. Now it's just the

979
04:55:47,779 --> 04:56:00,299
red door back here. All right. There's the yellow door. What is the red door?

980
04:56:21,220 --> 04:56:28,419
Damn, that's far. That's all the way back here. All right. Wait. Didn't I already do this? I

981
04:56:28,419 --> 04:56:54,220
already did this. No, this is wrong. So wait. There are multiple red doors. Oh, shit.

982
04:57:02,330 --> 04:57:11,099
Left after yellow door. Isn't that the one that I just opened? So left after yellow door.

983
04:57:12,950 --> 04:57:21,819
Is you talking about like go here like through here? Should I just open a wiki behind the junk?

984
04:57:24,729 --> 04:57:48,279
Okay. Now nowhere. He's actually blind. What are you talking about?

985
04:57:52,779 --> 04:58:00,619
Okay. So if this changed, this was the I knew I had my in my brain. This was a different.

986
04:58:01,580 --> 04:58:08,470
I'm not taking this. So like this was why I pressed a button and all of a sudden the whole

987
04:58:08,470 --> 04:58:58,970
world changes. I didn't think this was anything important. Flush your sins away. I thought that

988
04:58:58,970 --> 04:59:10,680
was the secret. This is this. This is this is not bullshit. This is a real place. I thought. Wow.

989
04:59:10,680 --> 04:59:18,009
Okay. I stand completely corrected here. This is a whole new level. All right. I thought you guys

990
04:59:18,009 --> 04:59:21,860
just taking the piss. I thought that was like a secret way to leave that level. All right.

991
04:59:22,020 --> 04:59:51,750
Whatever. Let's go. All right. All right. It's time just to smoke them out.

992
05:00:12,819 --> 05:00:26,009
Yellow key. That was a direct hit. Leave all this stuff. Red key is the cat police.

993
05:00:27,209 --> 05:01:08,250
All right. A couple ways to go. Let's try this way first. Hey, you little bastard. Fuck. They're

994
05:01:08,250 --> 05:01:26,659
going to bite your toes off. I hope not. All right. Red secret inside of the secret. Interesting.

995
05:01:27,459 --> 05:02:00,069
All right. Got a red key. This is another secret. Hey, it is. And shotguns. Put on the rat song.

996
05:02:14,740 --> 05:02:26,709
All right. Germa the rat song for one hour.

997
05:02:36,869 --> 05:02:49,770
This is going to start fucking with me. Wait.

998
05:02:53,290 --> 05:03:04,490
I can't take this. I can't take. I can only take this for like 30 seconds. Ecomaniac.

999
05:03:10,169 --> 05:03:24,889
No, I can't do this for more than a few minutes. I'm killing them. That's not something.

1000
05:03:33,430 --> 05:03:40,220
Put on the birthday remix. What happened to the song? Oh.

1001
05:03:43,740 --> 05:03:45,819
It's infiltrating my brain.

1002
05:04:02,619 --> 05:04:03,340
Yellow key.

1003
05:04:11,900 --> 05:04:15,819
Oh, man. It's like a maze. All right. I need yellow key. Yellow.

1004
05:04:18,889 --> 05:04:26,069
All right. Birthday remix. I can't hear this anymore. That's I just clicked on the wrong one.

1005
05:04:33,610 --> 05:04:35,209
It's staying. It's staying.

1006
05:04:46,299 --> 05:04:48,220
This song is so fucking stupid.

1007
05:04:53,020 --> 05:04:58,060
I need a blue key. No. Fuck this song. I don't want to listen to this one either.

1008
05:05:01,240 --> 05:05:21,380
How about a rat's birthday mixtape? This has 679,000 views. I didn't upload this.

1009
05:05:22,259 --> 05:05:34,459
This is a video. There's a lot of views. All right. I need to get a yellow key.

1010
05:05:49,180 --> 05:06:04,119
I'm lost. I know that's what the blue door is, but where do I get the blue key? I'm so lost.

1011
05:06:05,479 --> 05:06:27,029
There it is. Turn it up.

1012
05:07:46,299 --> 05:07:55,540
Is it not done? That was actually a giant rat.

1013
05:07:57,349 --> 05:08:00,549
Blast yourself back down. Did I just, didn't I try that? I was standing on it.

1014
05:08:05,860 --> 05:08:16,389
Hooray. That was cool. What does this put you out? Just you skip to the next level.

1015
05:08:18,299 --> 05:08:22,970
This puts you on blasphemy. That was fun. All right. Let me actually,

1016
05:08:24,139 --> 05:08:28,139
I'm glad you guys told me to do that. All right. Endless mode. The farm.

1017
05:08:29,020 --> 05:08:40,819
I want to try it. This is a series of waves.

1018
05:08:47,639 --> 05:08:54,659
Damage numbers or something. Has there been damage numbers this whole game?

1019
05:09:06,549 --> 05:09:17,299
Oh, I probably shouldn't have done that. All right. Wave two. Where are you? Oh, behind me.

1020
05:09:18,259 --> 05:09:26,860
Give me. Oh, wait. Shotgun. Yeah. Give me the shotgun.

1021
05:09:27,259 --> 05:09:43,110
All right. Is there any health? Or do I just have to survive? Oh my God. He was, he, he's up there.

1022
05:09:44,069 --> 05:09:54,310
He just spawned on top of me. Why does he get to wave three? I can do better than that.

1023
05:09:54,869 --> 05:10:14,330
Is this shooting faster or am I insane? Taking damage on wave one? Laugh out loud.

1024
05:10:15,529 --> 05:10:31,419
I just want to make sure I get everything. All the, all the levels, you know?

1025
05:10:32,459 --> 05:10:43,939
So what's a respectable thing to get to? What's a respectable wave? Three?

1026
05:10:45,220 --> 05:11:25,080
Twenty? Twenty? Are you kidding me? Re-chat. Re-chat. Once you hit 20, you're in the big leagues.

1027
05:11:39,659 --> 05:11:58,779
All right. Using rifle on that kind of enemies. Seriously. Discussion. Go home. Go home.

1028
05:11:58,779 --> 05:12:12,020
Go home. Turn off your streaming. Go home. We're just running around in a circle.

1029
05:12:12,020 --> 05:12:29,540
Really just hit me. We're just running around. Just stop running. Just turn. What? You fucking

1030
05:12:29,540 --> 05:13:14,060
asshole. Jesus. Holy. No. He was. Oh, I can do it. No. God. What is this? Did he wrap around

1031
05:13:14,060 --> 05:13:35,659
behind me? He just gave me one hit. Stupid. Give me all my shit. Give me all my shit. Give me all

1032
05:13:35,659 --> 05:14:45,209
my shit. Give me my shit. What's shooting me? You must learn everything. Collect. Collect.

1033
05:15:11,430 --> 05:15:35,540
Stop. Put on the rat song. I'm concentrating. I'm concentrating. I can't do that.

1034
05:15:48,020 --> 05:16:33,560
No way. No way. No way. There's no way. No way. Dude, you left your stream on. I'm playing.

1035
05:16:34,119 --> 05:16:42,380
This is a, this game's dangerous. This is not a drill. German 95 is playing the ratacombs

1036
05:16:43,340 --> 05:16:45,979
and it has the song on in the background.

1037
05:16:50,680 --> 05:17:00,040
This game's dangerous because I, I just, I know I have what it takes to get to like 10 or 20.

1038
05:17:00,979 --> 05:17:09,770
But I've been playing, I played it a lot today. I might be blending together. I know I can do it

1039
05:17:09,770 --> 05:17:15,130
and that's, that's what, that's the problem. Is me thinking I can get to like level 10

1040
05:17:15,770 --> 05:17:35,849
will keep me here for five hours straight. I'm going to slow down. What's with the speed? You

1041
05:17:35,849 --> 05:17:41,619
don't have to go that fast. You really don't. In fact, it's probably better off if you don't.

1042
05:17:42,500 --> 05:18:15,020
Okay. Let's just keep it going. Okay. That's good. I have to at least get to like seven or eight.

1043
05:18:15,020 --> 05:18:23,659
I have to. Now I'm going to get to level seven. How would I ever call my mother later and say I,

1044
05:18:24,299 --> 05:18:26,700
you know, then talk to her on our weekly Sunday discussions.

1045
05:18:27,580 --> 05:19:03,400
Easy. Careful. Careful. Don't get that. Does that, hold on. Does that respond every time?

1046
05:19:05,540 --> 05:19:12,040
I want to spam. I can't, I can't look away. I get to spam it. Whatever the answer is.

1047
05:19:19,060 --> 05:19:38,860
Fuck you. Jesus. Maybe. You can't say maybe. Guys on top have to go first

1048
05:19:39,500 --> 05:19:50,860
unless you're literally right in front of me. Oh, somebody. I don't know who it was.

1049
05:20:15,220 --> 05:20:19,770
Oh, is there another chainsaw guy? There is, isn't there? I know there's a chainsaw guy hanging out.

1050
05:20:20,569 --> 05:20:36,970
He forgot he was streaming again. That's okay. Holy fucking my face.

1051
05:20:38,009 --> 05:21:17,700
Chainsaw guy. Where is he? I know he exists. What? Who? Dick. Oh, what the fuck? There was

1052
05:21:17,700 --> 05:21:27,400
a chainsaw guy behind me the whole time. He missed somehow. He missed. I don't know how he

1053
05:21:27,400 --> 05:21:33,479
missed. All right. I got to seven. I can stop. I'm done. Game's fun. Okay. That's instantly done.

1054
05:21:34,200 --> 05:21:50,229
All right. I'm happy with it. I got to seven. That's all I care about.

1055
05:21:51,189 --> 05:22:02,020
Fuck. That's a lot of guys with the shotguns. Can't reach 10. I'm okay with that. It's tough.

1056
05:22:04,220 --> 05:22:13,060
It's tricky. It is, guys. It's tricky. Play a different map, you donut. I'm a man.

1057
05:22:13,939 --> 05:23:03,500
I call that bullshit. He thinks he's screaming again. All right. If I don't get to seven,

1058
05:23:04,139 --> 05:23:18,119
who cares? But I'm going to do a different map. Oh my lord. I didn't even know he existed.

1059
05:23:19,080 --> 05:23:36,409
Didn't even know. These guys are so fast. Like they're so fast. My eyes are itching. What do I do?

1060
05:23:36,409 --> 05:24:27,240
Call the eye doctor. Did I actually get hit by that? Somebody's still running around. It's this

1061
05:24:27,240 --> 05:24:57,669
guy. Is the dog still there? I hope not. Where's the dog? All right. Wave six. We're skipping this

1062
05:24:57,669 --> 05:25:42,680
one. Die. Oh, will he die? Okay. I'm seven. The problem was I had the shotgun equipped and it's

1063
05:25:42,680 --> 05:26:02,580
just not fast enough when you have like 10 people running into the room. That's going to fuck with

1064
05:26:02,580 --> 05:26:27,939
me. Give me all the guns. I know there's somebody behind me. I know there is. I know.

1065
05:26:29,540 --> 05:26:48,259
Oh, excuse me. Okay. What's with that spawn?

1066
05:26:51,299 --> 05:27:19,560
Did you just juke me? This is hard. This is tricky. This is where

1067
05:27:21,880 --> 05:27:30,709
what especially the spawns. You just don't know where to go. You just got to keep moving. But if

1068
05:27:30,709 --> 05:27:34,549
you move, what if there's a guy, what if a crazy doctor spawns on top of you? Just stabs you.

1069
05:27:34,549 --> 05:27:53,560
Give me all the stuff. I have no health. This is a wash.

1070
05:27:57,369 --> 05:28:00,200
Is there anything down there?

1071
05:28:13,349 --> 05:28:28,939
Two shots with the crazy doctors. Didn't want to pick that up. God damn it.

1072
05:28:41,459 --> 05:29:03,159
Hey. Oh, my health is so low. Where are those onions? Where are those onions?

1073
05:29:05,340 --> 05:29:27,720
Where are the onions? What? What just happened? What if it hit me? All right,

1074
05:29:27,720 --> 05:29:42,729
let's go through the cathedral. I'm burning up. I'm burning out here. I probably should

1075
05:29:42,729 --> 05:30:08,119
have picked that up after. I don't want to be stuck out. I got to get items. Whoa. That's

1076
05:30:10,119 --> 05:30:50,220
this is going to be scary. Guns. Need them. Don't use these yet. Back of my head is itching.

1077
05:30:50,220 --> 05:30:58,099
Why is my head so itchy? What's wrong with my body? I'll take the sword. That's actually pretty good.

1078
05:30:59,060 --> 05:32:27,080
Dogs got in. Who's left? Day. The tornado's here. The tornado is here. I did it. Is there

1079
05:32:27,080 --> 05:32:53,900
another tornado? Another tornado. Damn it. God damn it. I'm out of cool shit. I'm out of good shit.

1080
05:33:03,270 --> 05:33:09,450
Whoa. Oh, my God. That just threw me off so bad. Where did you even come from?

1081
05:33:10,659 --> 05:33:25,720
What? Oh, all right. It's my last attempt. This one. This one's too long.

1082
05:33:34,520 --> 05:33:43,540
There was one mistake and it's over. You make a single mistake. No, no human error allowed.

1083
05:33:43,540 --> 05:34:21,779
Don't you dare. I got dead. All right. Last attempt. That's it. And I'm done. All right. Wait,

1084
05:34:21,779 --> 05:34:47,500
wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me some weapons. Give me some shit. I got to get items. Okay. Now

1085
05:34:47,500 --> 05:34:52,950
I'm going to do two rounds inside the cathedral with the riveter. This should be good enough.

1086
05:34:53,750 --> 05:35:30,740
Okay. We're good. Stay in here. That's why the tornado comes. So you can't pull this shit.

1087
05:35:31,380 --> 05:36:00,819
There's a lot of health out there. All right. It's time to move out. Here comes the tornado.

1088
05:36:33,459 --> 05:36:39,779
Oh, I'm in trouble now. I'm dead. See you later. I wasn't getting up. Yeah. I'm not getting away

1089
05:36:39,779 --> 05:36:55,259
from that one. I couldn't go left because there was the, uh, I was fucked. Damn. I threw it. Well,

1090
05:36:55,259 --> 05:37:38,310
I mean, I just, I couldn't get around it fast enough. Okay. This is actually it. No matter what.

1091
05:37:38,869 --> 05:37:56,950
I need to get the other weapons. I'm thinking. All right. Get some weapons. Why? Hold on. Why

1092
05:37:56,950 --> 05:38:14,979
would you just do that? Why are you? I hit right. I, what grenades do I? No, I'm in trouble.

1093
05:38:22,700 --> 05:39:10,380
Machine gun fire. You gotta be standing right there. Dick. Dude. He's going wacky. All right.

1094
05:39:10,380 --> 05:39:20,169
I got to try to get to past seven. Although I'm running on empty. It's all right. No excuses. Let's

1095
05:39:20,250 --> 05:39:30,150
go. That was bad. That was very, very bad. That was the worst thing that could have possibly

1096
05:39:30,150 --> 05:39:36,979
happened. I thought he was already on the other side. I'm dead. Yeah. Oh yeah. This is over.

1097
05:39:49,689 --> 05:40:05,299
Where'd the dog go? Oh man. It's so, it's so intense. I'm so addicted to it, but it's

1098
05:40:05,299 --> 05:40:26,490
so intense. Again. No, no. I, I'm at, I think I'm at a wall right now. Maybe if I started with this,

1099
05:40:26,889 --> 05:40:34,650
look, I blew every ounce of my video gamer essence on that gauntlet level where I had to

1100
05:40:34,650 --> 05:40:57,830
fight like 5,000 people. My gaming spirit is depleted. His gaming meter is low. Boost is morale.

1101
05:41:00,220 --> 05:41:14,299
So here's the deal. I'm going to do it one more time. I'm going to be quiet this time.

1102
05:41:14,299 --> 05:43:20,389
Fuck, fuck, fuck. It's like holding my breath. Oh, fuck, fuck. I still got it. Did I just,

1103
05:43:20,389 --> 05:43:59,299
holy shit, calm down. God damn it. You fucking assholes. God, this spread and the damages.

1104
05:43:59,299 --> 05:44:35,459
God, this sucks. Well, I'm dead. Oh, okay. I need help. That's not good enough.

1105
05:44:36,180 --> 05:44:48,490
How am I ever going to kill these guys when there's 10 of them that spawn on top of the roofs?

1106
05:44:49,450 --> 05:45:10,099
Let's get away from the spawns, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Give me the, uh, there's a rifle ammo.

1107
05:45:11,669 --> 05:45:24,090
No, I didn't want you to die. I didn't want you to die. Oh, it's, oh, it's so hard.

1108
05:45:27,400 --> 05:45:40,950
God damn it. Oh, it's so hard. They're all up on their rafters. You got to like almost

1109
05:45:40,950 --> 05:45:53,400
hide it. You can't hide it here though. No, that's it. That's it. I'm just, I'm okay. I'm

1110
05:45:53,400 --> 05:45:57,159
going to say my goodbyes to you while I do this and I'm not paying attention so maybe I'll do better.

1111
05:46:00,229 --> 05:46:09,189
So next week, I'm going to be gone for a couple days. I'll see you guys on, uh, what's today?

1112
05:46:09,189 --> 05:46:23,369
What is today? What's today? Saturday? Sunday? Saturday. I'll see you guys on Tuesday and what

1113
05:46:23,369 --> 05:46:27,290
we're going to do is we're going to start the Outer Worlds. I'm going to just play. I've been

1114
05:46:27,290 --> 05:46:34,040
putting it off and putting it off and putting it off for a month. I've actually been putting it

1115
05:46:34,040 --> 05:46:53,659
off for a month. So that's what we're going to do. I have no idea how anything about the game. I

1116
05:46:53,659 --> 05:47:05,979
just know that it's the new Vegas guys. Is there a new video game? I can't believe you didn't die.

1117
05:47:08,259 --> 05:47:28,759
There's the guy with the gun here. He's right there. There he is.

1118
05:47:28,759 --> 05:48:34,380
There's his punk. All right, slow down. Give me this shit. Pick it all up. And look, here's

1119
05:48:34,380 --> 05:48:39,959
the thing. If Outer Worlds, if I don't like Outer Worlds, then I just won't play it.

1120
05:48:42,040 --> 05:49:22,330
It's that simple. You either like it or you don't. Okay, I have an opportunity here.

1121
05:49:23,049 --> 05:50:28,659
Okay, the strategy is shotgun. Whoa! There's somebody else. All right, I did it. I actually,

1122
05:50:28,659 --> 05:50:34,580
I finally did it. I can go to bed now. I can go to bed. I've done. I've done. I did my thing.

1123
05:50:34,580 --> 05:50:38,500
I'm going to cash out here. All right, this is who wants to be a millionaire. I got to the

1124
05:50:39,220 --> 05:50:42,340
$40,000 question. I just got it and I'm done. I'll take the money, please.

1125
05:51:20,729 --> 05:51:34,200
All right, I'm going to pick up the S. Not yet, though. I need ammo. Okay, good.

1126
05:51:34,919 --> 05:51:41,110
Let me just ammo. Five community subs. Thanks for the five community subs.

1127
05:51:43,880 --> 05:52:23,529
Near shoe. Thank you for that. What level is it? Oh, I, what did I? All right, that's it.

1128
05:52:24,090 --> 05:52:33,189
I had to do that. Getting to level 20 is where it really begins. Holy shit. I can't imagine

1129
05:52:33,189 --> 05:52:43,740
how hard that is. If you get past level 10, 12, 15. Oh, actually perfect time to stop. We're just

1130
05:52:43,740 --> 05:52:53,659
at about exactly almost six hours. Exactly what I thought it was going to be. So I will see you

1131
05:52:53,659 --> 05:53:03,939
guys again on Tuesday. We're going to do the outer world. Get to level 10. Oh, I can't. I'm

1132
05:53:03,939 --> 05:53:11,299
burnt up. I have to ash my body that is a cigarette right now. Like there's just,

1133
05:53:11,299 --> 05:53:17,619
you haven't ashed it. There's just dead cigarette for the entire length of the cigarette. You have

1134
05:53:17,619 --> 05:53:29,139
to ash it. I'm just dead. I'm a burnt out cigarette right now. That was a weird analogy. Can you tell

1135
05:53:29,139 --> 05:53:34,860
that I'm burnt up? What did I just say? I have a cigarette ash when you drag it all the way and

1136
05:53:34,860 --> 05:53:44,810
you add it, but I haven't been ashed. Uh, dusk was amazing. That was a really, really good game,

1137
05:53:48,889 --> 05:53:58,580
but I'm, uh, I'm spent. I'll see you guys in a couple of days for the outer worlds. If you

1138
05:53:58,580 --> 05:54:08,020
don't have dusk, see if you can beat my score. Level nine on endless mode of the farm. Put in

1139
05:54:08,020 --> 05:54:18,939
the comments if you got there and what is your favorite weapon? Please make, please give me

1140
05:54:18,939 --> 05:54:29,529
engagements. So there's like 30,000 comments in my comment section. What's your favorite ice cream?

1141
05:54:30,090 --> 05:54:44,340
Guaranteed to get like at least 15,000 comments, but I am out of here. I'll see you guys in a few

1142
05:54:44,340 --> 05:54:51,450
days. Thanks for watching. As always, it was a blast. That game is fucking great. Highly recommend

1143
05:54:55,669 --> 05:55:00,310
this. There's a lot of content too. That took a long time. That was six hours today.

1144
05:55:01,349 --> 05:55:11,540
What? Five and a half, four and a half hours yesterday. That's like a 10 hour game. I did not

1145
05:55:11,540 --> 05:55:30,979
expect it to be that long. Let's see what we got here. That's kind of loud. Yeah, I never,

1146
05:55:30,979 --> 05:55:36,099
I didn't try the challenge super impossible hard difficulty. I feel like I just wouldn't want to do

1147
05:55:36,099 --> 05:55:45,000
it. I would take, you take one damage and you just die. I feel like that would be angry at that game.

1148
05:55:45,639 --> 05:55:54,650
If you 100% every level, it's like 15 hours. That's a lot. I spent more time in dusk than I did

1149
05:55:55,450 --> 05:56:08,439
a lot of first AAA first party games that come out 12 hours. But yeah, uh, let's do the bits.

1150
05:56:08,439 --> 05:56:15,110
I'll see you guys in a few days. Thanks for watching. As always, let's get to it. Who's the

1151
05:56:15,110 --> 05:56:22,599
Oh, at the top bits. Let's see. Oh, look at that. Oh, look at that. Wait, is this real? It changed.

1152
05:56:23,159 --> 05:56:44,950
Is this for real? I don't think it was this from like three days ago. How could this be so incorrect?

1153
05:56:45,669 --> 05:56:55,610
I don't understand. I don't think that's right. But thank you to all of you. Anyways, let's go back to

1154
05:56:55,610 --> 05:57:01,830
a six hours ago. We had cream corn, thanks to 250. Hey, Germany, do you think we're going to get

1155
05:57:01,830 --> 05:57:06,549
another German awards on New Year's Eve? It was my favorite stream last year. Reminiscing with Chad

1156
05:57:06,549 --> 05:57:11,990
on the highlights of 2018 was a great way to close out the year. It'd be fun to do the same for 2019.

1157
05:57:11,990 --> 05:57:30,439
Yes, there's going to be another stream awards. Why not? It was fun. It's fun to look back on what

1158
05:57:30,439 --> 05:57:42,150
people nominate and what actually wins some of this stuff. Worst noise. I have in my mind what

1159
05:57:42,150 --> 05:57:53,750
the worst noise is. It's definitely going to win. There's no way it doesn't win. I can't even tell

1160
05:57:53,750 --> 05:58:03,259
you what it is. I don't want to influence any voting. But if this is selectable, there's 100%

1161
05:58:03,259 --> 05:58:16,500
no way that this loses to anything. It's making me laugh. Worst joke of the year taking vote. Yeah,

1162
05:58:16,500 --> 05:58:26,500
let's come up to the same categories. It should be a good time. Anyways, yes, it's in the plans.

1163
05:58:27,060 --> 05:58:33,240
But thank you for the 250. Thank you the plushie for the 500 bits. What's your opinion on pulp and

1164
05:58:33,240 --> 05:58:46,599
orange juice? Do not like. I don't want to do not like pulp in my orange juice.

1165
05:58:47,720 --> 05:58:51,479
I also don't like pulp and lemonade. I know that's some people say I like pulp and lemonade,

1166
05:58:51,479 --> 05:59:02,220
but not an orange juice. I disagree. Can you believe that they still sell heavy pulp?

1167
05:59:04,150 --> 05:59:17,540
That shit was so gross. You can buy lots of pulp. That stuff just sits up on the shelf.

1168
05:59:20,619 --> 05:59:27,240
Nobody buys that. No, you don't order orange juice like you order your peanut butter.

1169
05:59:27,799 --> 05:59:36,860
But that's just my opinion. It's actually kind of hard to find because nobody buys it.

1170
05:59:42,330 --> 05:59:52,790
I hate orange juice in my pulp. Well, that's weird. Jerma, you are a weak bitch.

1171
05:59:53,509 --> 06:00:06,200
Somebody time that person out, please. Just like 15 seconds is all I'm looking for for that one.

1172
06:00:06,200 --> 06:00:10,200
10 to 15 seconds so they can sit there and really think about what they just said to me.

1173
06:00:13,240 --> 06:00:22,259
No, because I agree. Hey, you're supposed to go to defy the king.

1174
06:00:24,229 --> 06:00:32,900
It ain't the king stream. It's not fucked the king yet. Not yet. No, I don't like pulp and

1175
06:00:32,900 --> 06:00:37,880
orange juice. Thank you, future gamer for the 250. What do you plan to do with Jerma985 and

1176
06:00:37,880 --> 06:00:45,029
second Jerma with the new Copa stuff? You could get fined like $40,000 per video if they decide

1177
06:00:45,029 --> 06:00:51,830
that you do not properly label your video as for kids. What? None of my videos are for kids.

1178
06:00:52,470 --> 06:00:57,849
I feel like even TF2 videos could be interpreted as for kids just off the thumbnail of a colorful

1179
06:00:57,849 --> 06:01:08,810
character. I'm not going to get fined $400,000. It might be a good idea just to label all of them

1180
06:01:08,810 --> 06:01:28,169
as for kids as a precaution. I mean, not for kids. Here's why that is not going to ever happen.

1181
06:01:29,259 --> 06:01:36,500
Because what about the guy that uploaded a video nine years ago and he doesn't even know the

1182
06:01:36,500 --> 06:01:42,009
password to his account anymore and it's not for kids and he doesn't even remember making the video

1183
06:01:42,650 --> 06:02:00,790
and they're gonna find that guy $40,000. Fuck him. He goes to jail. No, YouTube is just,

1184
06:02:00,790 --> 06:02:09,909
YouTube is a mess. You want to make a billion dollars? Anybody in here want to make like

1185
06:02:09,909 --> 06:02:22,099
$500 million? Raise your hand. Would you like to? I can tell you how. Just make a YouTube competitor

1186
06:02:23,060 --> 06:02:33,369
that is only for children. Only. Not YouTube kids. No, no. Just like a children's learning

1187
06:02:33,369 --> 06:02:39,299
center that's just all videos and you can just make educational videos for kids

1188
06:02:39,860 --> 06:02:51,450
video streaming site. If they're so concerned about this, why don't they have YouTube kids

1189
06:02:51,450 --> 06:03:00,549
be a separate uploader? If that's such a huge concern, separate the uploading. Make it so you

1190
06:03:00,549 --> 06:03:07,340
have to upload a video to YouTube kids. Why should I? Why would I upload videos just to

1191
06:03:07,340 --> 06:03:18,790
YouTube and like, Oh, whatever. I don't know. Who knows? But I think I saw somebody talking

1192
06:03:18,790 --> 06:03:23,139
about this the other day. And by the other day, I mean, it could have been anywhere within the

1193
06:03:23,139 --> 06:03:29,930
last three months that if you want to go through all of the videos you've ever made and make changes

1194
06:03:29,930 --> 06:03:37,659
to them, you're talking about dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of hours straight

1195
06:03:38,619 --> 06:03:52,869
just to check a box. It would take forever. It would probably take you like 30 to 40, 50 plus

1196
06:03:52,869 --> 06:04:05,060
hours just to check those boxes across. Like if you had thousands of videos, they just want you

1197
06:04:05,060 --> 06:04:13,819
to label your videos for not for kids. I, yeah, guess what? Smoking is not for kids either.

1198
06:04:13,819 --> 06:04:33,159
Somehow they end up doing it. What? How do you, how do I stop that? Endorsing, not about endorsing

1199
06:04:33,159 --> 06:04:37,880
child smoking. I'm just saying like, how do I prevent someone from not clicking on a video?

1200
06:04:38,599 --> 06:04:56,500
You know, kids aren't supposed to swear, but they do. If I upload a video to YouTube, I mean,

1201
06:04:56,500 --> 06:05:03,990
oh yeah, I guess this video is not for kids. Go to your favorite porn website right now.

1202
06:05:03,990 --> 06:05:13,639
Is there a thing that says, excuse me, you're not allowed to be here? Yeah, click. What? That's all,

1203
06:05:13,639 --> 06:05:27,750
that's the only thing that exists there. So what you're saying is we should blame the children.

1204
06:05:27,750 --> 06:05:35,020
No, no, I'm just saying like, I don't, I don't know who's could or couldn't be watching my videos.

1205
06:05:35,819 --> 06:05:40,939
If I'm going to get like fined in quotes or whatever for somebody watching a video of mine

1206
06:05:40,939 --> 06:05:48,389
from like seven years ago, I don't have any control over that. Should I just label my whole

1207
06:05:48,389 --> 06:06:08,569
channel like not for kids? I guess I could just do that. I don't want you to, yeah, I just don't

1208
06:06:08,569 --> 06:06:28,299
want to get fined. I have to look into this because that just seems strange. What about when, okay,

1209
06:06:28,299 --> 06:06:37,259
so what about when HBO shows a rerun of the Sopranos on your cable network and your kids

1210
06:06:37,340 --> 06:06:51,990
in the room and you don't know that they're watching it? Do we fine HBO? HBO? How, what the

1211
06:06:51,990 --> 06:07:14,779
fuck? It's all about the data collection. It's about advertising to kids, not kids seeing bad

1212
06:07:14,779 --> 06:07:22,090
stuff. See, I think they just fucked it up from the very beginning instead of just separating it

1213
06:07:22,090 --> 06:07:28,169
out completely from the very beginning because now you retroactively have billions of videos

1214
06:07:28,169 --> 06:07:45,930
that are not suitable for anybody that just exist. It's about kids, it's about kids seeing

1215
06:07:45,930 --> 06:08:04,250
completely shitty content. Oh, you're fucked, dude. But regardless, I don't know, I don't think

1216
06:08:04,250 --> 06:08:11,509
I'm going to get in any trouble for it. I'm going to have to like talk to Mac and go check on the

1217
06:08:11,509 --> 06:08:15,270
channel or something and see what I would have to do. I don't know what I would even have to do.

1218
06:08:24,330 --> 06:08:36,200
Watch VA ends up with like a hundred thousand dollar fine. I don't know, we'll find out. We'll

1219
06:08:36,200 --> 06:08:55,060
see. I don't think it's going to be that big of an issue. We'll see though. But let's move on.

1220
06:08:56,599 --> 06:09:05,939
Interesting thought, interesting conversation though. Thank you, future gamer. Appreciate it.

1221
06:09:07,700 --> 06:09:16,409
Propnator, thanks for the 1500 bits. I hope this is enough for a hangry pizza. I love pizza.

1222
06:09:17,209 --> 06:09:26,970
It definitely is enough. I will absolutely use that for a pizza. Thank you so much for the 1500

1223
06:09:26,970 --> 06:09:33,590
bits. Appreciate that. Emmanuel Depressed, thanks for the 300 bits. I originally thought you had

1224
06:09:33,590 --> 06:09:38,709
peaked with Shpee, but after long consideration, I've decided you have now peaked with Omega Pig.

1225
06:09:49,639 --> 06:10:00,889
Omega Pig. True? What do you mean, true? Spooky Spitfire, thanks for the 250. First,

1226
06:10:00,889 --> 06:10:06,650
this is a pretty interesting game. Second, I just had to spend like 60 or 70 dollars on the binding

1227
06:10:06,650 --> 06:10:13,849
of Isaac. Rebirth and afterbirth, because PSN sucks ass. Do you have any recommendations aside from

1228
06:10:13,849 --> 06:10:24,729
like never buying stuff from the PSN? You're covering a lot of bases on that one, so

1229
06:10:25,290 --> 06:10:39,500
that's all the advice I have. Why is it that much? 70 dollars? Is it really 70 bucks for everything

1230
06:10:39,500 --> 06:10:52,700
on PSN? It seems like a lot. They don't have a complete edition. Probably not from the US. Oh,

1231
06:10:52,700 --> 06:11:11,130
right, right. They probably had to buy it like three times. That's not good. Well, I'm sorry

1232
06:11:11,130 --> 06:11:17,880
to hear that, but thanks for the 255. Appreciate it. It's a great game. If this is the first time

1233
06:11:17,880 --> 06:11:25,849
you buy it, because that's a decade worth of content. That game is so much fun. Enjoy it.

1234
06:11:26,569 --> 06:11:30,090
Hole of one zombie, thanks for the 300 bits. Have you ever thought about playing System Shock 2?

1235
06:11:30,729 --> 06:11:34,090
I don't know how to put it other than your streams are hilarious. I think it'd be awesome

1236
06:11:34,090 --> 06:11:41,270
to see it get the German 985 treatment. German one guy. I've heard that's a very good game.

1237
06:11:41,830 --> 06:11:55,930
Put it on the list. Thanks for the 300 bits. Spooky Spitfire, thanks for the 250. German Isaac felt

1238
06:11:55,930 --> 06:12:01,930
bad for me, and on my second Judas run, I got super mush chocolate milk and then fucking brim

1239
06:12:01,930 --> 06:12:07,610
in the first two floors. On the third floor, I got Tammy set, so I basically... Wait, hold on.

1240
06:12:07,610 --> 06:12:14,700
What's going on? Isaac? This is two different people with two different Isaac stories.

1241
06:12:15,259 --> 06:12:29,700
You guys should talk to each other. No, it's not. The same person. This is the same person.

1242
06:12:30,259 --> 06:12:40,150
Why is it listed as a different person here? It's the same person. Why are you a different

1243
06:12:40,150 --> 06:12:49,049
person on my list here? What? Hold on. It's, yeah, twice right here. Okay, I had to refresh.

1244
06:12:54,979 --> 06:13:01,740
That was quick. For a second, I was like, holy shit, you guys are like, you guys should talk

1245
06:13:01,740 --> 06:13:11,509
to each other. Anyways, every single boss and floor, including Satan, it was beautiful.

1246
06:13:14,220 --> 06:13:17,819
You just bought the game and you did that? Well, you've ruined the whole game for the

1247
06:13:17,819 --> 06:13:25,689
rest of the time. You can never play Binding of Isaac ever again now. It'll never feel the same.

1248
06:13:25,689 --> 06:13:36,340
You have to do that again. You're gonna get to Satan with like the magician tears,

1249
06:13:36,340 --> 06:13:45,209
and you're gonna be really mad about it. There are plenty of broken builds. I know,

1250
06:13:45,209 --> 06:13:55,240
I'm just fucking around. Give it the German 985 treatment. What? What are you talking about?

1251
06:13:58,810 --> 06:14:03,689
Thank you. That's really cool to hear. If that's the first time you really played it.

1252
06:14:19,049 --> 06:14:23,049
I will sit up there. That sounds, thank you. I have my first job interview tomorrow and I'll

1253
06:14:23,049 --> 06:14:29,419
give you more money through a sub if I get the job. Hope you get it. Not for my sake at all,

1254
06:14:29,419 --> 06:14:37,580
but for yours. I'm happy to be your favorite content creator. Thank you.

1255
06:14:38,299 --> 06:14:46,200
Good luck. You're gonna, you'll be fine. You're gonna get the job. Don't worry. Thank you.

1256
06:14:46,200 --> 06:14:51,799
Creamcorn, thanks for the 250. Germo, what's the lore behind you getting TTS to say Michael

1257
06:14:51,799 --> 06:14:59,450
instead of singing it yourself? I think I explained it before. It's, it's a joke about those

1258
06:15:00,330 --> 06:15:08,810
tapes you could buy where it just says the kid's name. It sings a birthday song and you can get a

1259
06:15:08,810 --> 06:15:15,130
specialized custom. Oh, look, let's say you have a kid and the kid's name is just John, right?

1260
06:15:16,860 --> 06:15:22,380
It was a tape you could buy that you put in and they had like a hundred of them. John, Jack,

1261
06:15:22,380 --> 06:15:30,650
Jerry, Jeremy. And all it did was it sang the same song and just replaced the kid's name

1262
06:15:31,580 --> 06:15:36,459
with whatever name of the tape that you purchased. So you felt so special when you're on your

1263
06:15:36,459 --> 06:15:43,819
birthday because it was, hey, Jeremy, it's your birthday. Hey, Jeremy. And it was like,

1264
06:15:43,819 --> 06:15:47,900
they're talking about me. They're talking, that's, they're talking about me right now.

1265
06:15:47,900 --> 06:15:57,500
I think they still exist. They're on YouTube now. Go type in like birthday song for David.

1266
06:15:57,500 --> 06:16:16,020
The same thing will happen for instance. Okay. This one I just typed in is this

1267
06:16:16,020 --> 06:16:37,349
exactly what I was talking about. Let's see what happens. I mean, this one's way cool,

1268
06:16:37,349 --> 06:16:40,549
but you get the idea. Here you go. Here you go. Here's enough.

1269
06:17:05,770 --> 06:17:11,610
Okay. Cool. That was good. I wonder, I wonder what happens if I click on this one.

1270
06:17:11,610 --> 06:17:44,220
Happy birthday, Tyler. What about this one?

1271
06:18:03,430 --> 06:18:12,630
Happy birthday, Justin. How about this one? They're all the same.

1272
06:18:14,069 --> 06:18:17,509
There's another one. Completely different YouTube channel. Completely different channel.

1273
06:18:41,209 --> 06:18:47,529
Now you see in the world of YouTube, you can make these and technology has gotten a lot better.

1274
06:18:48,250 --> 06:18:55,130
But back in the day, they just had one recording of the song and the guy would be in the studio

1275
06:18:55,130 --> 06:18:59,930
and just say a hundred names and they would put that one piece in there. I'm not sure why

1276
06:18:59,930 --> 06:19:04,569
they would do it that way. The guy didn't sing the song a thousand times. He just said a thousand

1277
06:19:04,569 --> 06:19:08,889
names and sang the same song once. I think these, I think the people are actually singing the whole

1278
06:19:08,889 --> 06:19:18,619
song every time, or it's very good editing. Uh, this is another, this is another channel, I think.

1279
06:19:21,580 --> 06:19:40,419
It's cheaper and faster. That's right. Happy birthday, Gladys. So there you are. That's what,

1280
06:19:40,419 --> 06:20:26,330
that's what it was. Let's see. Me? What? They're talking about me. And the kid would lose their

1281
06:20:26,330 --> 06:20:31,770
mind because they thought that it was talking to them. It's the same reason why Dora was,

1282
06:20:31,770 --> 06:20:35,770
oh, do you know where it is? Yeah, I do. You're talking to me through the screen. You just don't,

1283
06:20:35,770 --> 06:20:49,779
what, you're like fucking seven. You're six. What the hell do you know? Let's get the credits on

1284
06:20:49,779 --> 06:20:57,580
screen. Roll them. Hey, it's really good. Those are YouTube kids friendly, right? They don't have to

1285
06:20:57,580 --> 06:21:19,060
do anything, right? Thanks for subbing everybody. If you still think people are talking to you

1286
06:21:19,060 --> 06:21:25,180
through the screen and you're seven, you're not the brightest kid. I, I'm, I know I'm just using

1287
06:21:25,180 --> 06:21:36,490
like a random young kid number. Let's just say four or three. Yeah. Seven is like second grade,

1288
06:21:36,490 --> 06:21:48,490
isn't it? They're talking to me still. Yeah. You're probably old enough to know that that's not

1289
06:21:48,490 --> 06:22:01,080
really happening, but that would thank you cream corn for the two 50. There's your explanation.

1290
06:22:01,080 --> 06:22:05,990
That's, I think I talked about it before, but that's what it's from door cube. Thanks for the

1291
06:22:05,990 --> 06:22:12,360
two 50. I met an internet friend in real life today because it turns out we both go to the same

1292
06:22:12,439 --> 06:22:19,159
school. That's a small world. We had no idea until recently. Anyways, he's also a big fan of you.

1293
06:22:23,819 --> 06:22:31,669
Don't ever tell me the odds. That's really interesting. Both go to the same school and

1294
06:22:31,669 --> 06:22:38,919
both watch this channel. Uh, he hasn't had the chance to watch recently. If you're watching

1295
06:22:38,919 --> 06:22:47,479
tonight, fluke, I hope you're able to make it through final with flying colors. Hope you did.

1296
06:22:56,599 --> 06:22:59,400
Thanks a lot. Uh, that's, that's a really, really interesting story actually.

1297
06:23:00,040 --> 06:23:06,389
That's really cool to know. Thank you. Gnarly for the two 50. Glad to hear you're going to play

1298
06:23:06,389 --> 06:23:11,509
outer worlds. I just beat it and had fun with it. Just so you know, chat will probably pressure you

1299
06:23:11,509 --> 06:23:17,830
into doing a low intelligence run. Honestly, it's not that much of a detriment, so you can do it.

1300
06:23:17,830 --> 06:23:23,770
If you think it might be fun for a while, I don't know. I'm, I'm going to, we'll just see what

1301
06:23:23,770 --> 06:23:34,099
happens. Let's see what happened. Caught up at near shoe. Thanks for the five subs. Son of genova.

1302
06:23:34,099 --> 06:23:38,259
Thanks for the two 50. Hey, German wanted to ask you to play blood fresh supply. It's a remaster of

1303
06:23:38,259 --> 06:23:45,720
an old dos FPS. I actually, when I was looking at a medieval, it's another one I was looking at

1304
06:23:45,720 --> 06:23:58,569
and doom also the original doom, but improved. Hypo was telling me about his ways to make it

1305
06:23:58,569 --> 06:24:07,830
in widescreen and better. So it is not as fuel-conducing as it could be now. We were

1306
06:24:07,830 --> 06:24:16,580
going to talk about and see. We'll take a look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, snoozing copter. Thanks

1307
06:24:16,580 --> 06:24:21,060
for the two 50 German. How are you? We're friends, right? And friends borrow each other's money,

1308
06:24:21,060 --> 06:24:26,900
right? Can you lend me $2 and 50 cents? I could really need it. Thanks.

1309
06:24:30,389 --> 06:24:35,110
Well, I have no way. I have no way to send this back to you. Also, I heard you wanted to play

1310
06:24:35,110 --> 06:24:41,509
death stranding off stream. Did you? What's your opinion? My opinion. I'll give you the real one.

1311
06:24:41,509 --> 06:24:52,950
The real opinion. I am. Yeah. I'm not going to play death stranding on stream. It's too long

1312
06:24:52,950 --> 06:25:06,599
for me to want to play it on stream. I think it's like a 40 plus hour experience.

1313
06:25:08,389 --> 06:25:13,669
And I don't the gameplay looks fun. It looks cool, but I don't think I want to do that for

1314
06:25:13,669 --> 06:25:21,619
30 hours. I've heard it's fantastic though, but that's something I probably would do in my own

1315
06:25:21,619 --> 06:25:35,459
leisure time. Even if I don't know, maybe I don't even have enough time to even sit down and play

1316
06:25:35,459 --> 06:25:40,819
I tried to play through God of War off stream and I got to maybe 10, 12 hours in and

1317
06:25:41,540 --> 06:25:52,200
almost 15 hours in and I kind of stopped there. I could see playing death stranding,

1318
06:25:55,529 --> 06:25:58,889
pick it up once a week and play it for a couple hours and just deliver some packages and do that

1319
06:25:58,889 --> 06:26:10,470
for a long time until the game's done. That you won't see it on stream. I don't think so. Not at

1320
06:26:10,470 --> 06:26:22,540
all. But thank you, snoozing copter. Thank you. Dragon breath. Thanks for the 250. Hi, I wanted

1321
06:26:22,619 --> 06:26:29,099
to say that I'm surprised you never touched Noita. It's a 2D rogue light with pixel sand physics.

1322
06:26:29,099 --> 06:26:33,099
I feel like it's right up your alley. Sorry, I'm outside the realm of the recommended channel,

1323
06:26:33,099 --> 06:26:38,380
so please don't smite me. I just like the game a lot. Also, does anyone else hear birthday music

1324
06:26:38,380 --> 06:26:49,500
or am I going crazy? I've heard it's very good, but I don't know if I'll stream it. Not now,

1325
06:26:50,139 --> 06:27:02,790
maybe. There's a lot coming up here. There's a lot coming up in the next few weeks. Maybe,

1326
06:27:02,790 --> 06:27:17,290
maybe soon. Maybe in the new year. 5G birthday? But I appreciate it, though. Maybe you'll see

1327
06:27:17,290 --> 06:27:21,770
that somewhere in like early 2020. That's one of those games that's going to be forever on the

1328
06:27:21,770 --> 06:27:34,119
list until I get bullied into playing it. But I do want to. And finally, Spooky Spitfire.

1329
06:27:37,020 --> 06:27:43,299
Back again here with 250. Thank you, Spooky. Well, he transitioned to the end of the stream.

1330
06:27:43,939 --> 06:27:48,259
Just an FYI, I've gotten every achievement pre-afterbirth in Isaac on my computer. Oh,

1331
06:27:48,259 --> 06:27:53,209
okay. There we go. But it's currently broken. So I was just like, dude, what do you mean this

1332
06:27:53,209 --> 06:27:58,810
run is god tier? LOL. Also, I know it's old and you have already played it on stream,

1333
06:27:59,529 --> 06:28:04,569
but chat is nuts and forced you to quit it early. But you should beat Hollow Knight off stream.

1334
06:28:04,569 --> 06:28:21,880
Tell me how the path of pain treats you. Hollow Knight was good. But Hollow Knight was, that was

1335
06:28:21,880 --> 06:28:36,119
also kind of back when I never streamed a game more than once or twice in a row. The new one's

1336
06:28:36,119 --> 06:28:48,310
coming out soon, too. It was really good. Yeah, I know. It's just lost forever. Soon? Is it not

1337
06:28:48,310 --> 06:29:07,130
soon? Wasn't it 2020? Like early 2020? It's TBA. Oh, okay. Well, we'll see when it comes up.

1338
06:29:08,569 --> 06:29:12,569
But I probably will end up just because I have to play through Hollow Knight before I do the

1339
06:29:12,569 --> 06:29:17,450
sequel. And you can't just, wait, you're gonna watch, you're gonna watch the movie's sequel

1340
06:29:17,450 --> 06:29:26,979
before you see the movie's prequel? What? No, the movie's sequel before you watch the first one.

1341
06:29:28,650 --> 06:29:32,490
Of course, you would watch the sequel before the, well, did the prequel come up?

1342
06:29:32,490 --> 06:29:41,290
When did the prequel come up? If there was a visual representation of my brain right now,

1343
06:29:42,009 --> 06:29:51,830
it would be a single hair in a giant dark room. And on the tip of the hair is a little

1344
06:29:51,909 --> 06:30:04,169
flake of fire just about to go out. Just, and that's, six hours ago, it was a blaze in there.

1345
06:30:04,169 --> 06:30:13,830
There was a wood stacked up really high. Playing games like that just drain me. They drain my whole

1346
06:30:13,830 --> 06:30:23,189
fucking psyche. What are my thoughts on the Mandalorian? I think it's amazing. I think it's

1347
06:30:23,189 --> 06:30:42,229
some of the best Star Wars content we've gotten this decade. I think it's fantastic. Real shit?

1348
06:30:42,229 --> 06:30:44,869
Yeah, no, I really do. I think it was really, really good.

1349
06:30:48,580 --> 06:30:55,750
Spoilers? No, don't say spoilers. Let people enjoy it because it's great. But that's my time.

1350
06:30:55,750 --> 06:30:59,029
I'll see you guys soon. Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking out dusk with me.

1351
06:31:00,709 --> 06:31:05,669
It was very, very good. Highly recommend. If you don't have it, go get it. It's a great game.

1352
06:31:06,470 --> 06:31:11,349
I will see you guys in a few days for The Outer Worlds. We'll just play through it. I will see

1353
06:31:11,349 --> 06:31:15,590
if I like it. If we don't like it, then we're going to play that fucking YouTuber hand simulator game.

1354
06:31:16,150 --> 06:31:28,869
I think I'll like it though. Good night guys. See you soon. Have a fantastic rest of your weekend.
