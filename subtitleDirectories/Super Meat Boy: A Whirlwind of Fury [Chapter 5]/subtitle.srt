1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,890
Hey, what is going on everybody. Jerma here with Super Meat Boy Chapter 5, The Rapture.

2
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,429
And this is going to be probably the ragiest episode. Well, I take that back.

3
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,429
You might be watching this in the future after I do a few more of these episodes and go,

4
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:32,429
Jerma, well, three episodes from now you throw your controller against the wall and punch your brother in the face.

5
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:35,429
Well, you know, I'm sorry, but I will. Let's just go.

6
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:41,659
Rapture Chapter 5. I'm not looking forward to this, guys.

7
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:44,600
So let's start the cutscene.

8
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,880
We're climbing. Oh my God, my whole body hurts.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,119
Time to get revenge.

10
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,810
Yay, I did it. I kicked that asshole off the edge.

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,500
The Rapture.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,109
Here we go, guys. Level one.

13
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:15,109
I only have four Band-Aids. My goodness gracious, that's bad.

14
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:21,129
Let's try and get this warp zone. I don't think I'm going to have enough time to get it.

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Oh, listen to that music.

16
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,989
Oh dear Lord.

17
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:34,260
Already level one. It's like impossible.

18
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,459
Here we go.

19
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:40,459
I got to remember there's like a very specific way you do this. You go up.

20
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:44,459
And then, oh my God, I don't remember.

21
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,019
No, I do. Now I do. Now I do. Now I do.

22
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:50,900
Let's make this...

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,900
I'm gonna die so many times in this game.

24
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,780
You have to go very fast right here. It's like that. No!

25
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:11,229
Well, welcome to the 97 minute video.

26
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:19,060
There we go. There it is. Warp zone. You know what? Forget the warp zone.

27
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,419
I know for a fact I'm going to be very mad at myself.

28
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:30,219
Oh my goodness gracious. That was just level one.

29
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:33,099
That was level one.

30
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,750
Level one, folks.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,449
That's one way.

32
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,449
Forget what you do here. Definitely this.

33
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:53,139
That one wasn't so bad.

34
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,439
That one wasn't so bad.

35
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,919
Go. We got to jump over because it pushes you down.

36
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,039
Jump. Oh dear God.

37
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,979
Jump. Jump.

38
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,340
No.

39
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,969
Speaking another language now. German, apparently.

40
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:23,729
Okay, get this right this time. Just float through it.

41
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,219
Float through it. No! Oh!

42
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,060
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

43
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,060
What you got? I can't believe it didn't register again.

44
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,300
It usually doesn't happen two times in a row like that.

45
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,919
Oh, for the love of...

46
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,919
Here come the swears.

47
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,659
You know, if you are an old subscriber of mine, you know that I typically don't use a...

48
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,659
How come this...

49
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:56,409
You know that I typically don't swear very much in my videos,

50
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:00,409
and that's because I like to keep my channel PG-13, essentially.

51
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:06,409
But when you're playing Super Meat Boy, sometimes you just have to scream the F word.

52
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,819
Okay, here we go. Let's do it. Come on.

53
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,779
Oh, boy. It's going to be a long day.

54
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:29,439
No, I'm not going to make it. Not going to make it. Not going to make it.

55
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,980
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

56
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,720
Come on. Come on. My whole body just moved.

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Oh, I am doing something wrong. You know what? I need to stop on that platform.

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,279
That's what I'm doing wrong.

59
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,779
Oh, boy.

60
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:55,000
I hope this isn't like a nine-hour video.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,300
All right. No. Right here. Stay there.

62
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,949
That's not what I wanted. That's not what I wanted!

63
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,740
Okay. Who knows? Guys, I really might puke.

64
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Oh, my word. There's no way I'm going to get this.

65
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
This is impossible. This is impossible.

66
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,689
This is not possible.

67
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,379
I might as well just jump off the damn edge.

68
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,740
Whee. Yeah, just jump off the damn edge.

69
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:34,540
Come on. Get it.

70
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,980
Okay. Okay.

71
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,980
Now, I can't let this happen like this again.

72
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,240
Oh, I forget how you even go about doing this.

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,800
Go, go, you smelly.

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,639
Okay, I cannot mess this up, or else I'm going to be very bad.

75
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,639
There was a lot of deaths there, and I skipped them all.

76
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,639
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,579
No, I got to come across like this.

78
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:06,529
Just...

79
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,500
God.

80
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,750
God, no.

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
My whole body hurts. This is like level three.

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
I don't even know what level this is.

83
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
Well, I didn't make that.

84
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Now I know what to do exactly, though.

85
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Get it this time. I'm going to get it this time.

86
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,779
Here we go.

87
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:41,779
Oh, for the... I'm going to punch a piece of puke in the face.

88
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,500
I hope I'm not peeking my microphone.

89
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,420
I got to go much higher than that.

90
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,350
Like that.

91
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,579
Come on. Come on.

92
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:02,579
Time to switch.

93
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,079
Time to switch to commander video.

94
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,160
Oh, yeah.

95
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
I just fought off edge, I stupid.

96
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,420
It's like so much worse.

97
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,209
Oh, just get me over here.

98
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:23,279
It doesn't even matter. I can't even...

99
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,819
You know, I really need to unlock a couple of characters.

100
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,819
That's like the big kicker right here.

101
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,540
What if I do this?

102
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,540
Is that going to help me?

103
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,850
No, it's not.

104
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,850
Absolutely not.

105
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,300
What? I'm stuck.

106
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,240
Come on. There it is.

107
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
There we go.

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,180
Finally.

109
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,180
No.

110
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,959
How am I...

111
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,959
There's no way.

112
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,959
There's no way I can do this.

113
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,199
How am I going to make this jump?

114
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
That was my head exploding.

115
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,699
You know, I'm probably doing something wrong.

116
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,699
And this is what happens when you play the game blind

117
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,699
if you're not playing for like a year or two.

118
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,060
No, I'm doing something wrong.

119
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,060
What am I doing wrong?

120
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,259
I will never know.

121
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:24,259
No, no, no, no, no, no.

122
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,180
What if I...

123
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,180
Do I jump up there maybe?

124
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,550
I just don't know.

125
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,549
I just don't know.

126
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,649
Oh, that's what you have to do.

127
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,649
You got to like hang out on it for a second.

128
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:38,649
All right, I got it.

129
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,649
I got it. I got it.

130
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,909
Man, this is just going to get so much worse.

131
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,149
No, I just tried to do the same damn thing I was doing before.

132
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:55,149
All right, so how long has it been?

133
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,419
Like 30 minutes and I'm on like level six?

134
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,940
Oh, don't you dare.

135
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Don't you dare.

136
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,700
Oh, I got an A plus.

137
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Level five.

138
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,279
Oh, my goodness.

139
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,279
Good.

140
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,539
I'd rather play on this level to be totally honest with you.

141
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:20,539
This thing is a piece of cake compared to the other ones.

142
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:25,919
I can't.

143
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,889
Go, go, go.

144
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,700
You slippery bastard.

145
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,679
And cut this thing off.

146
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,679
If I can make it up there.

147
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,500
Good, good, good.

148
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Let's string a few together, huh?

149
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,169
It's been a while since I've been able to string one of these together.

150
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:56,460
The real question is I need to...

151
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
Oh, I'm like not paying attention.

152
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
Does that stay open?

153
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,460
No, it doesn't.

154
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Okay, go, go, go.

155
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,539
Whew.

156
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,840
The fallen.

157
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
The fallen.

158
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,590
I should have grabbed that key.

159
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,830
Like, you know, I got to get that key when it falls like this.

160
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,779
Like that.

161
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,220
Hmm.

162
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,799
Don't know what's down here.

163
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,799
Nothing.

164
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,799
There's nothing down here.

165
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,799
Except the button.

166
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,490
You have to...

167
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,419
They're training you to catch that key.

168
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,419
That's what that's all about.

169
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,620
Isn't that just fan-freaking-tastic?

170
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
Die!

171
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,309
You just have to die if you don't get it.

172
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:47,309
That's the worst part.

173
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:52,860
This whole game is just about playing the level over and over and over again

174
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
until you memorize the pattern.

175
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,120
And I got it.

176
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I got it.

177
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,490
Let's go back now.

178
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,179
Can I even go back?

179
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:02,179
Yeah, I can.

180
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,659
Whew.

181
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:11,799
Oh, I didn't have enough speed!

182
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:17,000
I didn't have enough goddamn speed!

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Meepo, you're supposed to be all about speed.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,230
What the hell, man?

185
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,230
There's the speed I need.

186
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,230
A little bit of speed, that's it.

187
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,730
What?

188
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,799
Oh.

189
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,799
Imagine if I just fell down right there.

190
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,299
I would probably take a dump and a brick would come out.

191
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,580
Good.

192
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,580
Give me 50 of these levels in a row.

193
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,580
I can handle these.

194
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
No, I can't.

195
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,100
Eh, famous last words.

196
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,590
I've got to be easy here.

197
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,590
Just a pattern.

198
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,539
That's all it is.

199
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm going to go left, stand left, and then go right.

200
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,000
It's all just a bunch of mathematical problems.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,159
Oh my god, what am I thinking?

202
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,159
Very easy.

203
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,529
Very easy.

204
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,960
Just be easy.

205
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,519
You've got to be smooth.

206
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,519
You just got...

207
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,519
Why did I just let that hit me?

208
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
I just stood there with like a goose with a thumb up my butt.

209
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,519
Just like...

210
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,080
I don't know what kind of relevance that has, but...

211
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Oh my god.

212
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,080
I can't take it anymore.

213
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,259
I need to utilize my jumps.

214
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,259
I have the damn jumps.

215
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,259
Like, why am I not utilizing them?

216
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,429
I was in the clear.

217
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:44,639
I'm going to drink gasoline if that happens again, but not really.

218
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:55,799
Oh, I got ultimate rage party.

219
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,799
Who wants to be invited to the ultimate rage party with me as your host?

220
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,360
Oh, it's not even over yet.

221
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Not even close to being over, probably.

222
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,559
And then you got this little dumb jump.

223
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,500
A+.

224
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah.

225
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Thanks.

226
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,019
Hey.

227
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,019
Hey.

228
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,019
Hey.

229
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,840
Whoa.

230
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,659
Whoa.

231
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:21,659
What did I ever do to you?

232
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:23,730
Leave me alone.

233
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,730
Who do you think you are?

234
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,730
What do you think you're doing?

235
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,179
You know, I'm running you back here.

236
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:29,179
You're a real nuisance.

237
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,179
Get out of here.

238
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,179
I'll let your other buddy out too.

239
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:32,179
You guys can play hide and go seek together for all I care.

240
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,580
Get away from me.

241
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,580
Oh, and now there's three of yous?

242
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,580
I can't wait.

243
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,259
Let's have a party.

244
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:42,129
All right.

245
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:45,610
This one's not that bad.

246
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,610
I just got to keep these guys at bay.

247
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,610
Get this thing.

248
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,700
Drag this idiot over here.

249
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Come on.

250
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
I know you're all about jumping around like a freak.

251
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Just like me.

252
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,519
We could be best friends.

253
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,519
Thank you.

254
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,519
Grinding mill.

255
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,519
Wow.

256
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,519
Okay.

257
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,519
Okay.

258
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,100
Cool.

259
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,299
I'm trying to like just cheat.

260
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,299
Can I jump up to you?

261
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:07,299
What am I?

262
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,299
Oh, now I remember.

263
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:13,019
You need to, you need to last this entire time until they all fall down.

264
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,019
Get out.

265
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,019
Oh, hold on.

266
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,019
Headphone just fell out.

267
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,470
Headphone fell out of here.

268
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,470
Emergency.

269
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,899
There we go.

270
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:21,899
It's back in.

271
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:22,899
Just standing here dying over and over again.

272
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:23,899
That's fantastic.

273
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:24,899
Let's go.

274
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,580
Come on.

275
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,529
I'll take all of you on at the same time.

276
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:32,529
Yeah.

277
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:33,529
Look at this.

278
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,049
Look at this.

279
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,049
Exploit.

280
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,480
Exploit.

281
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,490
Another question.

282
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,490
What is this?

283
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,490
What is this?

284
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,919
What is this?

285
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,919
What is this?

286
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,179
What is this?

287
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,179
What is this?

288
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,490
What is this?

289
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,490
What is this?

290
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,730
What is this?

291
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,159
What is this?

292
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,850
Exploit.

293
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,850
Exploit.

294
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,149
Another question is how do I get down?

295
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,330
That's the actual question now.

296
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,330
Like this?

297
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,220
No, you have to go back and forth.

298
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,220
It's all about just going.

299
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,730
Oh, you had to have it spawn right there, you son of a bitch.

300
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,730
Give me the key.

301
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,970
Give me the key.

302
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,399
Give me that key.

303
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,220
Now that they're all spread out, get away from me.

304
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
No more spawn, right?

305
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,659
Oh my God.

306
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,240
Come on.

307
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,789
Oh, I'm going to punch someone.

308
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:31,070
I'm going to punch myself in the face.

309
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,259
It's waiting over here.

310
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,259
No, no, I can't.

311
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,259
Just keep moving.

312
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:42,519
God, it's so much anxiety.

313
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,549
Make it.

314
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:46,549
No.

315
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:47,549
No.

316
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:55,139
Come on.

317
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,740
There is no escaping this.

318
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,000
I need to get this going here.

319
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I need to get this going.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,779
Give me the key.

321
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,019
Everyone get over here.

322
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:07,980
I swear there's a tea party over there on the right side.

323
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
Now I'm taking way too long.

324
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,629
Go.

325
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,590
I got it.

326
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,590
I got it.

327
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,429
I got it and everything.

328
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:24,490
Oh, I just send me to hell.

329
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,490
Wow.

330
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,490
That's yeah.

331
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,009
Okay.

332
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,759
Hi, guys.

333
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,759
Oh, I did.

334
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,759
I did take a break after that one.

335
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,759
Hold on.

336
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,759
Give me 10 seconds.

337
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,429
We'll watch all these deaths.

338
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:43,460
Oh, holy crap.

339
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:49,500
That is a way to have your stomach erupt in flames.

340
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
What?

341
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,450
Oh, hey.

342
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,490
Hey, leave me alone.

343
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,179
Go.

344
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,179
Get them.

345
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,860
I can get them killed, can't I?

346
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,279
I'm not sure I can get them killed.

347
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,279
Hit the button.

348
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,710
Hit the button.

349
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:11,779
Oh, you troll.

350
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:16,099
This is this game was just created to frustrate people.

351
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,099
And that's why it's so fun.

352
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,109
Get me up there.

353
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,289
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

354
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,809
There it is.

355
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,809
Wait, where's the?

356
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,049
Oh, no, I got to hit the button too.

357
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,609
Let's try this again.

358
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:31,609
There we go.

359
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:32,609
Yeah.

360
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:34,619
Get smashed.

361
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:35,619
Get smashed.

362
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:46,250
Thank the high heavens.

363
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:51,529
And go.

364
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,170
I wish these guys would just go away.

365
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,890
I can't imagine what this is like in the dark world.

366
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,890
There's no way I'm going to get up here.

367
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,890
Yeah, there is.

368
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,369
Come on now, man.

369
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,369
I was there.

370
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:03,529
Go.

371
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:06,299
Go.

372
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,930
Oh.

373
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,940
Hoo.

374
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,009
Hoo.

375
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,660
The lamb?

376
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
What the hell was this level just called?

377
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,339
The lamb?

378
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,339
Go.

379
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:21,740
Oh.

380
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
Hands.

381
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Hands are getting sweaty.

382
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,140
That's how you know you're in a lot of trouble when your hands get all clammy.

383
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,839
Go.

384
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,019
Jump.

385
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,619
Jump.

386
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:34,619
Jump.

387
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:35,859
Jump.

388
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:36,859
Oh.

389
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:37,859
No, wait.

390
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:38,859
I can wait here.

391
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,359
I can rest here.

392
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,660
Go.

393
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,349
Go.

394
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:44,589
Go.

395
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:45,900
Come on.

396
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Come on.

397
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Come on.

398
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Come on.

399
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Come on.

400
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,539
Oh my god.

401
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:56,549
Oh my god.

402
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,700
I think that just took six months off my life.

403
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
I really think so.

404
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,660
I remember these guys.

405
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,980
They chase you around.

406
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,900
These guys are really annoying.

407
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,500
They remind me of the thing in the...

408
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,710
A lot of things remind me of the Mario Brothers thing, huh?

409
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,000
I want to go off that wall.

410
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,690
Yeah.

411
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,690
Come on.

412
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,099
Come on.

413
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:29,099
Get that key.

414
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:32,170
I've got to go back up here now, don't I?

415
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,170
No, I don't.

416
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,539
You know what?

417
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,940
I kind of want to go up here and just launch off just to get away from this guy, but I'm

418
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,160
not going to do that because I'll probably end in certain death.

419
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
So I'm just going to do it again.

420
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Don't get st...

421
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Oh, I got stuck underneath.

422
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,160
You know, I'm just going to do what I want to do in the beginning, just jump off the

423
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,359
whole thing.

424
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,819
Nope.

425
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:54,819
That didn't work.

426
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,819
I had it too.

427
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,819
Why did I come all the way back here?

428
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,380
Why did I do that?

429
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,519
That was such a dumb move.

430
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,670
And so was jumping into his mouth right there.

431
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,490
I don't know where anything is.

432
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,200
No.

433
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,849
Ugh.

434
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,940
God.

435
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,500
Jump.

436
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Jump over him.

437
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,380
Yeah.

438
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,970
Come follow me this way.

439
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,970
Anglerfish.

440
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,970
Whatever the hell you are.

441
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,170
Freak of nature.

442
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,180
Get away.

443
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Oh, now he's just going to hover here.

444
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,940
I hate this guy.

445
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Oh, he's stuck over here now.

446
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
Oh, man.

447
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
This is bad.

448
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,970
This is bad.

449
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,720
Oh.

450
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,980
I got to get over here.

451
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,950
Ugh.

452
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,279
Ugh.

453
00:20:54,279 --> 00:21:04,990
Let's watch the deaths.

454
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,990
Everybody goes.

455
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,430
There actually wasn't very many people.

456
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,609
Only one survived this long though.

457
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:13,609
And it was this guy.

458
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,549
The flood.

459
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:16,859
Oh, the flood.

460
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:17,859
Oi.

461
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,480
The flood isn't coming.

462
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,779
You have to run from the flood.

463
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:23,779
I should have ran already.

464
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:24,779
Yeah.

465
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,089
I should have ran before that.

466
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,839
Like right now.

467
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,839
And I shouldn't hit my head on the ceiling.

468
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,220
Like a butt head.

469
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,220
Now I'm in a lot of trouble.

470
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,349
Gotta go fast.

471
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:45,160
Stop going slow.

472
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Ugh.

473
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,779
I slowed down again.

474
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,220
Good.

475
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,220
Oh.

476
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:59,740
If somebody were to cut together all the noises I've made in these videos, you'd probably have quite a symphony of noises.

477
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:06,819
I hate plus.

478
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:11,019
I think I've only gotten three or four of those this entire time.

479
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,349
Oh my goodness gracious.

480
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:15,349
Hey, look.

481
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:16,349
She's right there.

482
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:17,349
Yo.

483
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:18,349
What a troll.

484
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:22,980
What a troll.

485
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Aye.

486
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,059
Germa powering down.

487
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,490
Germa powering down.

488
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,730
Germa is powering down.

489
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,670
Ugh.

490
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,670
Backup power initiated.

491
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,319
Really?

492
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,319
You just gotta have to jump over there.

493
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,319
Just into her.

494
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,319
And you just get launched down like that.

495
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,319
That's how you do it.

496
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,970
The only question now is just getting over here without getting crushed.

497
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,170
I don't even know what's over there.

498
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,170
I have no idea.

499
00:22:52,170 --> 00:23:00,130
Hey, why didn't I just jump over there?

500
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,130
And what am I doing?

501
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,130
What am I doing with my life?

502
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,940
This time I'm just going to jump.

503
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,920
I'm gonna go to commander video.

504
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,920
I have a feeling that he might be a little bit better on this particular stage at least.

505
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Oh, just go straight down.

506
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh, that was just...

507
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh, come on.

508
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,660
You're gonna do that to me like that.

509
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
You're gonna play with commander video.

510
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,660
You gotta go a long way.

511
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,660
I didn't...

512
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:41,529
Where is my jump?

513
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,529
There it is.

514
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:43,529
And now I brought this guy.

515
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:44,769
Great.

516
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:47,460
He's absolutely going to kill me.

517
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,849
Not if I do this.

518
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,519
This is not healthy.

519
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,779
This is not healthy.

520
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:06,839
If I went to my doctor and told him, like,

521
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,839
Oh, hey, doctor.

522
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,839
By the way, I'm playing Super Meat Boy right now.

523
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,839
He'd probably be like,

524
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,839
Don't play that game.

525
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,230
That game's gonna give you a heart attack, son.

526
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,230
What the hell are you thinking?

527
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,049
And I'd say, well, I wanted it to have fun.

528
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:22,049
And he'd go,

529
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:25,049
Get out of my office before I slap you.

530
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:27,349
I don't know why my doctor's slapping me.

531
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:30,490
Something ill is going on there.

532
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,490
I can't even, like, figure this out with anybody.

533
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:39,759
No, no.

534
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,759
Oh, I know what the title of this video is gonna be.

535
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:50,259
Uninstall game is gonna be the title of this video.

536
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:54,269
Oh, Super Meat Boy.

537
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:56,269
Uninstall the damn game.

538
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:59,640
If that's not the title, then I don't know what should be.

539
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,329
No, I was there.

540
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:04,329
I was there, man.

541
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:07,079
How are you gonna do me like that?

542
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,279
I'm gonna get Game Genie

543
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,279
and put the cheat codes into this stupid game.

544
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,160
Now you know you're starting to get mad

545
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
when you start to call the game names

546
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
and say it's bad and not a good game.

547
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,589
That's how you know that you're really getting pressed.

548
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,750
No, whoa, whoa.

549
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,750
I just had, like, a little bit of lag right there.

550
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,750
What's going on with the lag?

551
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,440
Can you guys...

552
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,130
No.

553
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,130
Oh, my good God.

554
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,579
I'm gonna hire somebody to come beat this level for me.

555
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:48,700
1-800-get-someone-to-beat-the-damn-level-for-you.org.com.

556
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,700
slash.edu

557
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,779
I...

558
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:55,779
See, right now, I'm just so bad.

559
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,220
I can't even concentrate on what I'm doing.

560
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
And this isn't even the hardest thing that's gonna happen.

561
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,900
This is actually pretty tame.

562
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,660
I gotta get that guy away from that.

563
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,660
That's the number one thing.

564
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Get this guy away from that.

565
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,539
No.

566
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,539
I...

567
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:18,849
Now I'm just getting sad.

568
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:22,150
I've been on this level for, like, 15 minutes.

569
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,930
Now I'm just making careless mistakes.

570
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:33,289
By the end of this, I'm gonna buy a new controller

571
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:35,289
because this one is going across the room.

572
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:38,869
Hey, Wall.

573
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:39,869
Nice to meet you, Wall.

574
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:41,869
My name's Jerma's Controller.

575
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,869
I'm about to be thrown into you

576
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:47,109
and shatter into a million pieces.

577
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:51,079
All right, I'm gonna be totally silent.

578
00:26:51,079 --> 00:27:04,069
Oh, crap.

579
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:08,000
Just...

580
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,140
Is this the last level?

581
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,089
Screw this.

582
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:17,089
Is this the last level before the boss?

583
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:19,089
Oh, no!

584
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:23,740
There's, like, four more levels after this.

585
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:36,599
Gotta get that guy away from that.

586
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:39,220
Okay, he's gone.

587
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,380
Okay, okay, okay.

588
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
Easy, easy.

589
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,559
Don't lose it here.

590
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:53,900
Oh, my God, there's even more.

591
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
There's even more.

592
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,970
Oh!

593
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,960
Oh!

594
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,220
Oh!

595
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,059
Now this guy's over here.

596
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:11,650
He's gonna get me.

597
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,589
Now, how am I supposed to get this without...

598
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:17,589
Oh, you have to jump a tiny bit.

599
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:21,220
Get out of here.

600
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,299
Oh!

601
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:24,299
Oh, come on.

602
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,500
Just get her.

603
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,910
Wow.

604
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,910
Could you give me some other level to deal with?

605
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,920
I don't care.

606
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm so, so sick of dying on that last level.

607
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,779
Oh, of course.

608
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:42,779
I run right into that.

609
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:49,039
Oh.

610
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,039
This is the sound you make when you're depressed.

611
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,039
When you're depressed, you...

612
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,900
Come on.

613
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,039
Now I can do this.

614
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,039
It's getting close, guys.

615
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:13,039
I'm getting really close to either biting, throwing, or punching everything around me.

616
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,039
My whole desk is going down.

617
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:21,730
I'm going to drop a nuclear bomb of just destruction on my desk.

618
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:28,579
There's going to be no remnants of this desk.

619
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:29,579
Go!

620
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:33,099
Yeah, go ahead and shoot your saw blades at me.

621
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:34,529
Do it again.

622
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:41,480
Oh, there's so much difficulty in these levels.

623
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,059
So much difficulty.

624
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:52,779
Literally, I think that really the only way you could beat this game is if you play each level 5,000 times.

625
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:55,950
That's really the only way you can successfully get through some of this stuff.

626
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,380
Shoot it at me.

627
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Why didn't you shoot it at me?

628
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,099
I don't even want to know how long this video is going to be.

629
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:06,099
This is going to take like 16 hours to upload.

630
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:09,039
General Plays Chapter 5.

631
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,039
Whatever the...

632
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,599
F...

633
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,599
S-H-I...

634
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,599
Capital D-A...

635
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,170
All right.

636
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,859
Last time I was quiet.

637
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:23,859
I did it.

638
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:24,859
So time to be quiet.

639
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:33,940
Shoot at me, you mother...

640
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,460
How did that get in there?

641
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,029
Shoot it.

642
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:56,500
This is not even turning into a...

643
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,500
This is turning from a let's play into a whirlwind of fury.

644
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,440
You know what?

645
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
That's actually a pretty good title.

646
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
I think that's what I'm going to call this video.

647
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Whirlwind of fury.

648
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,559
I just got to get up there quick.

649
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,559
Quickly.

650
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,559
Shoot it.

651
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,559
Shoot it.

652
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:21,720
Get another break.

653
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,839
Whew.

654
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,359
Where's auto?

655
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,359
I need like...

656
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,359
I need comfort from my dog.

657
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,109
That was ridiculous.

658
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:35,700
Almost done.

659
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Two more levels.

660
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
That's it.

661
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,089
Hey, I got the band-aid.

662
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:48,819
Oh, I can only imagine how terrible this is going to be.

663
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:50,819
Wow.

664
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:51,819
No way.

665
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:54,259
I totally forgot about this level.

666
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:55,259
This level is atrocious.

667
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:56,259
Please.

668
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:57,259
No.

669
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:58,259
I had...

670
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,259
Why did I move?

671
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,259
Why the...

672
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:02,900
We're sorry.

673
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
Jerma is experiencing technical difficulties.

674
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:11,339
He is currently about to scream every swear he's ever heard in his life.

675
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:13,089
Almost.

676
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:14,089
Almost.

677
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:15,089
That was close.

678
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:16,089
That was close.

679
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:17,089
Seriously.

680
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:24,910
I'm going to put a cereal box.

681
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,220
Never mind.

682
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,220
Oh, I got the band-aid.

683
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,220
Girl, good.

684
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,220
You're great.

685
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,220
Good thing you got that band-aid.

686
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,710
Let's go.

687
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,710
Just be easy.

688
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,529
Be careful.

689
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:36,980
Because this next part...

690
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,980
That was my hand on the desk.

691
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
This is the end of the game, right?

692
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,420
This is like the end of the, like, actual game.

693
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
I'm pretty sure about that.

694
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,640
All right.

695
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Time to be silent.

696
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,160
Just going to sit right...

697
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Never mind.

698
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
This is so horrible.

699
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
This is horrible.

700
00:32:51,160 --> 00:33:46,559
I wish I could just stand, like, just bob up and down here.

701
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,849
I could probably be easier dodging things.

702
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:53,049
I'm going to get hit with a missile.

703
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,170
Not yet.

704
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,170
Not yet.

705
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,170
Not yet.

706
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,170
Not yet.

707
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,980
Not yet.

708
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
Not yet.

709
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,160
Not yet.

710
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Not yet.

711
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Not yet.

712
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,589
Not yet.

713
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:05,589
Not yet.

714
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:06,589
Not yet.

715
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:13,719
Not yet.

716
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,719
Not yet.

717
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,719
Not yet.

718
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,719
Not yet.

719
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,719
Not yet.

720
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,719
Not yet.

721
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,719
Not yet.

722
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,719
Not yet.

723
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,719
Not yet.

724
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,539
Not yet.

725
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:26,500
Not yet.

726
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Not yet.

727
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Not yet.

728
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Not yet.

729
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Not yet.

730
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Not yet.

731
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Not yet.

732
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:35,400
Not yet.

733
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Not yet.

734
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Not yet.

735
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,340
Not yet.

736
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
Not yet.

737
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
Not yet.

738
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,340
Not yet.

739
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,849
Not yet.

Not yet.

Not yet.

Not yet.

743
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:52,239
Not yet.

744
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,239
Not yet.

745
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,239
Not yet.

746
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,239
Not yet.

747
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,239
Not yet.

748
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,239
Not yet.

749
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,239
Not yet.

750
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,239
Not yet.

751
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,239
Not yet.

752
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,960
Now get in there.

753
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,230
Get...

754
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,230
Oh.

755
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,369
Ooh.

756
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:12,949
Happy time.

757
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:13,949
Happy...

758
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,949
Just think about a happy place in your life.

759
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,750
Think about grandma's cookies.

760
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:26,289
Think about how delicious grandma's cookies are and how much you love going to summer

761
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,590
camp when you were a kid.

762
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:36,780
And you gotta think of your favorite ice cream, my chocolate, and how much you want to strangle

763
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,110
you.

764
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,309
No, no.

765
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:42,309
We gotta think happy thoughts here.

766
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,309
No.

767
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,739
We gotta get happy thoughts.

768
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,139
Will you blow it up already?

769
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:47,139
Oh.

770
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,139
Would you blow it up already?

771
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:50,340
How did...

772
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Oh, wow.

773
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,579
That was a stroke of just weird luck that it didn't hit me.

774
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:57,829
Okay.

775
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:58,829
I can take a second here.

776
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,780
Take a second.

777
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,949
I don't care about the A+.

778
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:03,949
Just want to go.

779
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:04,949
Go.

780
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:07,860
Go.

781
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Go.

782
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
This guy.

783
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,860
Don't even think about killing me.

784
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,760
Don't even think about it.

785
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Okay, guys.

786
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,900
We have successfully made it to level 20 of Rapture.

787
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,309
And...

788
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:22,710
Dude, this guy is relentless.

789
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,710
Get out of here, man.

790
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,699
You know, I gotta get these guys out of here.

791
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:30,179
This guy cannot be over here with me.

792
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:32,300
I gotta get him all over on this side.

793
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
So you come up with me.

794
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,300
Go ahead.

795
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,039
Come on, you piece of crap.

796
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,130
Come on, you stupid piece of crap.

797
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,769
Just this and then I have to beat Dr. Fetus, I think.

798
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,769
Oh, all three of them.

799
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:46,769
Come on over here.

800
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:50,099
Why not all three of you?

801
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,780
It actually turned out to be for the better, apparently.

802
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
There's still...

803
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
All three of them still here.

804
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
Oh, this is not possible.

805
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
This is not possible.

806
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
This is not possible.

807
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
This is impossible.

808
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
This is impossible.

809
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,780
Oh, and the blade kills me.

810
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:18,800
You guys just go fast so they can't come near you.

811
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,739
Get back over here.

812
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,739
I'm going to...

813
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,739
Not good.

814
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,329
Not good.

815
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,329
Not good.

816
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:39,489
At least there's only two now to just smoke me in one second.

817
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:43,130
See there's like so many other nice things I could be doing like right now.

818
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,530
I could be going for a walk.

819
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:52,090
I could be singing a song on like karaoke machines.

820
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:57,320
I could be at Burger Boys laughing.

821
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:05,039
But no, I'm stuck on level 20 of Super Meat Boy Rapture.

822
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:06,519
Oddly enjoying this though.

823
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,519
I don't know why.

824
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,119
Typically when I rage at games, I get very, very mad, but not right now.

825
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,119
But you know what?

826
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,440
It's time to shut up and beat the Dlamia level.

827
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
Let's go.

828
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,690
Get...

829
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,769
Oh my good gravy.

830
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:27,329
The inside of the dish, it's thick and it's gross.

831
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:33,389
Even though gravy is actually pretty delicious.

832
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:35,710
I want to find a guy that created this character.

833
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,389
Whoever like made this character, I want to punch him in the face.

834
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:48,239
Because this is the most annoying thing I've come across in this entire damn game.

835
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:58,909
God damn.

836
00:38:58,909 --> 00:38:59,909
Finally get the...

837
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:07,539
Get away from me.

838
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:20,800
Now I just don't die here like an idiot.

839
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,360
And he came with me.

840
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,159
No surprise there.

841
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,320
Over here.

842
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,059
My hand hurts.

843
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:39,980
I really am curious as to how many people bought this game and then just never played

844
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,639
it ever again because of these levels.

845
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,880
I can't imagine the amount of people that have been like, oh, let me get Super Meat

846
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Boy.

847
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,849
It looks like a fun game.

848
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:52,849
I can't beat it.

849
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,739
Oh, that was a miss.

850
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,139
I can't believe I didn't die from that.

851
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:00,380
Now just run back and forth.

852
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,380
That's it.

853
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
Drop down.

854
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,380
Go.

855
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,329
Don't die here.

856
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:06,329
Go.

857
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:07,329
Don't be a complete idiot.

858
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:09,780
No, that wasn't that.

859
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,610
That wasn't not what I wanted to do.

860
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,170
Go.

861
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:20,860
Oh, at the boss now.

862
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:26,789
Housers.

863
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:27,789
Larry's lament.

864
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:30,309
Let's go.

865
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:33,070
Where am I?

866
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,710
There's a button I'm going to press and you're going to be in trouble.

867
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,710
Locked in.

868
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,019
What the hell is this?

869
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,019
What?

870
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:41,019
What the hell is that thing?

871
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:46,119
Well, you're weird.

872
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,119
I know.

873
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,159
And so is my brother and my other brother.

874
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,159
And we're all twins.

875
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,159
Did you know?

876
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,159
Can you notice?

877
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,159
Yeah, I noticed.

878
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,159
Let's go.

879
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,019
I remember how to do this.

880
00:40:58,019 --> 00:40:59,019
Kind of.

881
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:02,579
They pop out of different places in the map and you got to run them into the blades.

882
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:03,579
That's all I remember.

883
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:05,010
Somebody jump into it.

884
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,340
Somebody jump into the blades.

885
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
No.

886
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:13,610
I'm going to stand right here.

887
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,380
No.

888
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,380
Hey.

889
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,380
Well, why don't you come over this way, you bastards?

890
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,179
That's one.

891
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,179
Then they run along.

892
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:24,179
I know they run across the edge.

893
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,539
I know that's one of them does that.

894
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:28,510
All right.

895
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,389
All right.

896
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,389
All right.

897
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,389
That was so close.

898
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,389
I can't even begin to tell you how close that was.

899
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:36,809
Watch out for the little ghouls.

900
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,239
Ghosts.

901
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,380
Got to stand right here.

902
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,260
Oh, I had one dead.

903
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,260
I had one dead.

904
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,690
I just did it.

905
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,130
I prematurely did that.

906
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,519
Can't stand there.

907
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,519
That's going to be trouble.

908
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,820
Should have stood there.

909
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,059
I should have stood there.

910
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:55,059
Come on.

911
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:58,800
Come on.

912
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,300
Right here.

913
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,179
Come on.

914
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:06,179
Do it.

915
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,340
No.

916
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Split second more.

917
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,400
Split second more.

918
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Just got to get rid of this one.

919
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,340
Come on.

920
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:27,190
Oh, poo in my breakfast.

921
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,190
I'm a broken man.

922
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:32,119
Yeah.

923
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,119
Land in that.

924
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,380
Just got to get your other, your siblings to do the same damn thing.

925
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,579
What even hit me?

926
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:41,219
What just hit me right there?

927
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:44,019
I'm going to rewind back and I want to see what actually just hit me right there because

928
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,019
nothing did.

929
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:49,070
Over this way.

930
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,070
I should have waited.

931
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,070
I never wait, though.

932
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:52,969
No.

933
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:53,969
Oh.

934
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:54,969
Damn it.

935
00:42:54,969 --> 00:43:01,820
That was a big mistake because now he's going to be alive.

936
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,059
No.

937
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,059
I just wanted to.

938
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:08,059
Yeah.

939
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:12,630
I just.

940
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,449
Stay here.

941
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:15,449
Have him jump into it.

942
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:19,010
Now, you just got to stay on this thing and then somebody else will launch into that.

943
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,179
Well, not right there, but they will.

944
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:22,489
Oh, they will.

945
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:25,579
Come on.

946
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:26,579
No.

947
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:41,780
There's a pattern here that I'm missing sort of maybe kind of not really.

948
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,139
I can't believe I did not.

949
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:47,010
I almost died with that.

950
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:48,750
Over here.

951
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,750
Come on.

952
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,949
I don't get all day.

953
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:52,949
He's going to do it again.

954
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:53,949
Whoa.

955
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:54,949
My game just froze.

956
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:57,190
My game just froze.

957
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,630
That was that was that was really bad.

958
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,150
Game legit just froze right there.

959
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,780
That's what I needed.

960
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,780
All right.

961
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
Now do it.

962
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,039
Do it.

963
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:11,039
Huh.

964
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:12,199
I'm not even touching them.

965
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:13,840
I didn't even touch that guy.

966
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:24,530
Oh, for the love of everything in planet Earth.

967
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,530
Somebody give me.

968
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,179
I got it.

969
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:30,119
I got it.

970
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,679
Just don't do anything stupid here.

971
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:33,179
And I got this.

972
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:41,840
Yeah.

973
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Jump over him.

974
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Jump over him.

975
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,260
Come on.

976
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,199
No.

977
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:50,199
Do your little dumb scream.

978
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,849
Get over here.

979
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:53,849
Come on.

980
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:55,860
Do it.

981
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,860
Please.

982
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,019
Just jump.

983
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:01,019
You're not jumping like I asked.

984
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:02,019
Oh, I did it.

985
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:05,940
Oh, my God.

986
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,179
Oh, I killed these guys.

987
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:10,860
You killed my minions.

988
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,260
Now you're going to really pay.

989
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,300
Oh, no, dude.

990
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,300
You're not getting away this time.

991
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,980
I'm absolutely jumping up this cliff and I'm going to grab onto this and you're dead.

992
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Come on.

993
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,929
Did I get it?

994
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,380
You got it.

995
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:32,500
OK, guys, that is the end of that.

996
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:37,940
Now I think the final thing, the end, is coming up.

997
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,920
So I think there's only a few levels here.

998
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
Don't worry.

999
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,150
We'll see it next week.

1000
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:51,309
Only five, six levels, but they are all going to probably take me as long as this video

1001
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:53,260
has taken me already.

1002
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,940
Oh, thank you for watching, everybody.

1003
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,099
Really appreciate it.

1004
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:02,690
So hopefully we can trek to the end of this and I can beat this game without breaking

1005
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:03,860
something.

1006
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Because I don't want to break anything.

1007
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:11,300
I came so, so close to doing bad things with this controller.

1008
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,300
But in the end, it's all right.

1009
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,599
It all worked out.

1010
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,599
So thanks again, guys.

1011
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:15,599
I'll see you all soon.

1012
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,199
And of course, take care, everybody.
