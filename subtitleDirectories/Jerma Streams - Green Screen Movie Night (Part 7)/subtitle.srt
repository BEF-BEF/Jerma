00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:11,820
Hello. Good afternoon. Good evening. Probably good evening for most of you at this point.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:24,149
How are you? He's not even here. I'm here. Just because I don't talk for the... I'm checking

3
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,429
buttons and making sure things look okay and checking knobs and

4
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:33,909
twisties and there's a lot of... I got a lot of buttons. There's a lot of buttons here.

5
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:40,579
There are a lot of buttons. You know, I can count them. You want me to count how many buttons I

6
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:47,619
have to pay attention to? Let's do it. Okay, so here we go. One, two, three, four, five, six,

7
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:55,990
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,299
nineteen, twenty. I've got twenty buttons that I need to be aware of at all times and let alone

9
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:11,909
the keyboard. How many buttons are on a keyboard? A lot. This is probably 75 buttons that I need to

10
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:20,790
be aware of at any given second. Now, how are you? Good to see you. We're going to talk about a few

11
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:29,700
things. We're going to wait because obviously this is green screen movie night DLC. The second part

12
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:39,500
of our green screen button times, I guess you could say. This time we are going to be browsing

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:50,250
through 125 videos, I think to be exact, which will bring the total of videos shown so far

14
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:59,459
after today at somewhere around 250, 300 out of like 700 plus submissions. So I'm just happy

15
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,700
we might be able to get through half of them and then half of them got to get shown again.

16
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,050
I want to make this really clear. There were so many submissions and there were so many good ones

17
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:15,849
that if your submission did not get shown, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. That's just the way it works.

18
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,289
I really, there's no other way I can say it. When there's that many submissions, we have to be

19
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:28,569
selective. So I'm really sorry if you don't get shown. It's not because yours wasn't good enough.

20
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:34,060
It's because there were too many really good ones. No, I didn't say sorry, not good enough.

21
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:49,979
Sorry. No, that's not what I said. He hates us. Yours sucked. And then a quote. That's not what I

22
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:58,650
said. But Oh God, Freddie dread. I just looked over. I don't say anything. I don't like shout

23
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,129
out subs anymore. You know that but Freddie dread. Holy shit. Freddie dreads. Very talented,

24
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:15,879
talented young man. Follow Freddie if you don't make some pretty sick music. I've actually hung

25
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:24,580
out with Freddie in real life. A lot of you maybe don't know that. Maybe now you do. All right. So

26
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:34,280
I plan. Here's the thing I planned on. I planned on doing a free baseball stream hype session,

27
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,469
but that's probably not going to happen. So what we're going to do instead is we're going to do a

28
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:51,099
baseball hype session right now. And the reason why I thought about this is because there's not

29
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,659
a whole lot that I'm going to talk about. Right? I was trying to think if I was going to do like

30
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:01,659
a one to two hour kind of a like ask me anything kind of thing with like we do the dollhouse,

31
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:07,909
I wouldn't be able to answer very many questions because I don't want to just be like, Oh, this is

32
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,430
this thing that's going to happen. This is this funny joke that I want to do. This is this house.

33
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:18,060
No, I mean, the whole thing is essentially a it's not like dollhouse. It's a viewing experience,

34
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,199
not necessarily a participating experience. But I do want to make sure that I put enough attention

35
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:34,439
on it because as Ludwig famously told me, dude, you didn't even tweet when we did the replacement

36
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:47,860
show. So this is let's hype it up. Let's go. There will be a tweet. I promise there will be a tweet

37
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:56,579
in the next 24 to 48 hours to really hype up that show. But also the difference between this and

38
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,980
let's say the replacement show. I didn't want people to know I was doing the replacement show,

39
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,060
right? Because I wanted that to be a big surprise that we were doing that. And I think it was pretty

40
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,600
successful. Oh, I want you to know we're doing this because this is a obviously much larger scale

41
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,079
and a lot cost a lot more money and has a lot more moving parts than the replacement show.

42
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,569
But no, I don't know. There were a lot of moving parts in the replacement show, too. There are a

43
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:33,029
lot of people. Is there going to be merch? Yes, there will be. Okay, I will answer that there will

44
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:39,269
be merch for the baseball show. It will be specific themed merch for the baseball show.

45
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:50,970
Yes, they will. And I will tell you this. The let's just go over what the show is. Okay.

46
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,139
It is part of the German Baseball Association. A lot of you guys didn't know that I had a league.

47
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,060
I am the sole umpire of the whole game. And in this exhibition match, it's between

48
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:18,709
the California circus and the Maryland magicians. I am the only umpire of the entire game.

49
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:24,899
That's my role. And I'm going to take it very seriously. I'm gonna take it incredibly

50
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:32,500
seriously. You drop some frames. I did. Oh, shit, I did. Let's hope that's not a problem.

51
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:53,480
Somebody said you're gonna get hit. Aren't you? You don't know. Listen to me. I think a lot of

52
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,879
people don't understand what this show is. This is listen to me. This is a real baseball game.

53
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:07,050
Between real baseball players. This is a real baseball game that I am going to be officiating.

54
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,120
This this is not Oh, it's a fake game with No, this is real shit. Real baseball,

55
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:27,399
real umpiring. And yes, I have practiced. You don't think that I have spent at least the last

56
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:36,360
few weeks studying umpire terminology, studying umpire stances, studying how to call a game.

57
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,120
You don't think that I've done that? You're not going to give me the credit that you think

58
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:49,750
you don't think I've done that. I'm going to call a very, very good game. Can we get your best

59
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:59,639
year out of here? Will there be hot dogs? Of course they will. Wait, somebody just said what

60
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:07,639
the fuck is an umpire? You don't know what you don't know what an umpire is? What do you think

61
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:18,170
it's like a judge? I mean, it kind of is a judge. Dude, what is an umpire? Okay, we have a problem

62
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,769
if a lot of you don't even know what an umpire is. An umpire is the referee of the game essentially.

63
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:45,190
What time is it at 4 30 pacific p.m. at 7 30 eastern time. We need to stream with you explaining

64
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,320
what baseball is. Somebody made a shirt for the for the show. That's awesome. Let me see.

65
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:09,480
Oh, I'll show this. Well, that's probably really loud. I'm not. It wasn't too loud. Okay. But yeah,

66
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:21,500
let's see. Where did it just go? Oh, there it is. But yes, this is not this is this is not

67
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:31,830
official merch or anything, but this is cool. Somebody made this. Let me make it smaller.

68
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:41,340
Look at that. You're going to wear this during the show. Well, yeah, good. Is it going to be popcorn?

69
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:57,139
Probably. Sue them. That's the first comment that I read. This is really cool. That's awesome. Yeah,

70
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:06,179
wear it. Yeah, there's we've got we've got broadcasters. There will be people calling

71
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:12,580
this game. There are two broadcasters. They are they are professional baseball commentators.

72
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:25,960
That's very important to understand too. It's a game of baseball. And I know a lot of people

73
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,940
have asked this question. So I'm going to answer it. There will there there are no

74
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,940
special guest appearances on this stream. They're on. This is a game of baseball.

75
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,769
There's no other streamers on this. It's just it's just me, the circus, magicians.

76
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:53,539
There's nobody else. Not a lot. A lot of people are asking, wait, is this is this person going

77
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:56,899
to be there? What about that person? Oh, I wonder if this let me just make sure you understand.

78
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:07,379
It's just me calling it a good clean game of baseball. Are you? No, I'm not lying.

79
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:19,639
You're a liar. No, I'm not lying. I swear. Just just wait. Just wait for the next one after

80
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,159
baseball. If you want to see some potential special guests, OK, just wait for the next

81
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:32,330
one after baseball. Is that you know, that'll be something that's talked about very soon after

82
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:41,289
baseball. Are you playing in the game? I am the umpire. I am the I got to call every ball,

83
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:45,350
every strike. I'm going to be behind the plate. I'm going to be out there in the field,

84
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:56,490
making sure I call it correct. You pinky swear. Well, I don't there's nothing for me. I don't

85
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,070
want to give much away and we bet on the game. I'm sure the mods will probably do it at the

86
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:14,009
beginning. How long is the game going to go for? Well, that all depends on how long it takes to

87
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:18,490
play nine innings of baseball. Sometimes it depends. It's a big scoring inning, big scoring

88
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:31,590
half inning. You're talking about probably three to five hours, depending I think around along

89
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:38,230
those lines. The date is the 19th, August 19th, which if you look at your calendar, that's this

90
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:46,179
Friday coming up here Friday. Is the umpire the masked guy? Yes.

91
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:55,960
Yes, the umpire is the masked guy behind the plate. The one with the mask. Yes. There you go.

92
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:09,269
Hope maybe you guys can get it there. Will you please do a cricket stream for EU? I don't know

93
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:23,720
crickets or no. I'm going I'm answering as many questions as I can. Is jigsaw going to be there?

94
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:31,509
No. Why would jigsaw be here? What purpose would jigsaw have at the baseball game?

95
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:46,169
Are you dropping frames? I am not dropped. I dropped a couple frames in the very beginning,

96
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:52,679
but I have not dropped any frames in the last 10 straight minutes. I don't know if that I don't

97
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,700
see anything on my end. Right when I turn the stream on, I dropped some, but there are no drop

98
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:04,860
frames now. I wonder if it's a twitch problem. Maybe try to refresh. It keeps loading for me.

99
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:13,899
That's weird. Is it is it actually happening? Because I don't see anything on my on my end here.

100
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:24,039
What if it rains? Oh, then I'm fucked. You know, but here's the thing about rain.

101
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:31,659
You can you can play baseball in the rain. So just drop some more or buffer. Really?

102
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:37,179
You can play baseball in the rain as long as it's not too crazy.

103
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,950
Is anybody is everybody having um issues with stream dropping? Because I don't see any on my

104
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:58,679
end. Is this happening to everybody? Well, I don't. Yeah, I don't see any problems at all here.

105
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:17,450
What's happening? I don't know. It buffers for a second. It does? Oh, yeah. I this I think this is

106
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:23,990
a twitch issue because I mean, usually I can see it and it's usually me. Hold on. Let me check

107
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:31,139
something. Usually I can look over here and see like my stream help and see the amount of frames

108
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,330
I've dropped and I haven't really dropped any. That's kind of concerning considering this is the

109
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:53,669
green screen DLC movie night. Let's see here. Oh, well, let's write it out for a second.

110
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:04,039
Let me know if it happens again. People are collectively saying it's buffering at the same

111
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:13,879
time. So it seems to be a twitch thing. Well, let's hope it passes. My DLC is lagging. Oh,

112
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:35,769
please walk everybody. All right. Well, here's the thing. This all these calls. Everything is

113
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:42,820
at my discretion. No one else. When I started talking to Community Jake about this idea a long

114
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:49,340
time ago is because, you know, usually I write up a bunch of shit. I call up Jake. I'm like,

115
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Jake, there's a thing I want to do. It's like, OK. And we start going back and forth. Jake starts

116
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,740
to figure out what things that we can do, where we can do it. We're hiring the right people,

117
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:04,220
whatever. Right. So I write a bunch of shit up and I give it to Jake. And Jake came back to me when

118
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,220
I first came up with this idea. And he said, hey, you have to call a whole game of baseball

119
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,740
with this idea. Like, what if you don't know like a certain rule? I'm just like, who cares?

120
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,180
He's like, well, what if you don't know what to do? Like, well, I'll just figure it out. Whatever.

121
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:34,660
I'll just I'll make something up. I'm I could get a lot of calls wrong, but I don't think I will.

122
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:43,690
I think it's going to be fine. He's like, OK, like, yeah, like I'm looking at all the things

123
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,690
you've written here. And the most concerning thing is the fact that you need to call a full

124
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:58,490
real game of baseball. And I'm like, yeah, OK. All right. Should we try? Should we go for it?

125
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:05,859
You need to wrap it up? Well, I can't. I don't want to wrap it up if people are dropping

126
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:11,619
the frames every 10 seconds. It's not my Internet. Is it happening in a while? Are we OK?

127
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:24,140
Should I just go? Yeah, we typically would have gone by now. I just it's not dropping

128
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,380
anything right now. OK. All right. Whatever. Let's go.

129
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:34,299
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode two of the Green Screen DLC Green Screen Night.

137
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:30,359
OK, hold on. I'm having that same problem with the stuff plays through the

138
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,859
the stuff plays through the microphone for some reason. That was pretty good.

139
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:52,490
I'll give him one sec while I reroute this. OK, that should be fine now. Is it? Let's test it.

140
00:20:54,869 --> 00:21:03,430
It's good. All right. That was that one. Coming up next. We've got Samira, you are letting

141
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:16,680
Germa lap you.

142
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:13,160
Lightsaber fight for Germa. Oh, sick. Really? Yes.

143
00:22:50,339 --> 00:23:03,180
Yeah, look at me. Look at me right now. Like that. That was awesome. You guys still effing?

144
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:12,839
Really? That's unfortunate. Yeah, there is no problem on my end here at all. I have my stream

145
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:19,609
health thing up. I have no drop frames. I've been at 6,000 up cleanly the last 20 minutes.

146
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:30,940
That's annoying. All right. The lightsaber fights, I got to tell you, it's my favorite.

147
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:43,799
Those are like my favorite ones. Bro, it's one guy. I mean, it looks like a lot of guys.

148
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:56,740
I'm seeing a lot of Fs. F because you died. Oh, oh, well, we need we need a different term.

149
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,710
You know what I mean? There's got to be a different term. This should be like F,

150
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:09,609
Fs for like stream and like F like you died, right? Let's go claim and Andy. Neverhood edit.

151
00:24:09,609 --> 00:25:11,420
I love this game. Why am I spinning around? Dude, I got it. I got it. I'm all right. Get it. Get it.

152
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,099
Dude, come on. Just get it. Get it. What is on my back? What's on my back? Get it. Just get it.

153
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:31,349
Oh, my God. It's huge, dude. It's huge. This game is so good. I feel actually all right.

154
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:39,740
I feel warm. I feel really warm, though. What the hell? What was that? What was that?

155
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:51,670
I got an 830 res at Dorcia. Great sea urchin ceviche. Dorcia on Friday. I think he's lying.

156
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:58,069
Is this a regular deck of cards? Is that a gram? You got gotta give you. There you go.

157
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:01,349
There you go. Playing cards. Pick a card. Any card. I don't want to see.

158
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:09,460
Pick a card. Pick a card. Very nice. Look at this one. That one right there. Good color. That one.

159
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,019
I'm going to stick it back in the deck right here. Check that out. Cut it. It's very cool,

160
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:23,640
baby. But that's nothing. Look at this. Nice. Egg shell with Romali and tight. What do you think?

161
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:30,339
What was it again? What was that card? That one right there, wasn't it? Bingo. Jesus,

162
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:39,160
that is really super. How do nitwits like you get so tasteful? I have no idea. Not a clue. Not a clue.

163
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:49,099
But wait, you ain't seen nothing yet. Raise lettering. Pale nimbus. Is that the card right

164
00:26:49,099 --> 00:27:05,059
there? Oh, it's a joker. Bingo. Here's your card. Thank you. You're right. Absolutely. Let's do

165
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:27,369
this. Pick this up. I'm going to strangle your parents. OK, that's what. I'm really sorry that

166
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:32,500
people are having problems. I think Twitch is fucked. That was a really good one. That was a

167
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:43,140
very good one. I hope some of you got to see it. I wonder, should I switch servers or something?

168
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:55,109
The audio is really quiet, too. It shouldn't be. All right. Actually, answer this poll truthfully.

169
00:27:55,109 --> 00:28:02,660
We're not joking around. Truth only. Truth only. Can I get a poll? Are you having a bunch of stream

170
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:10,680
problems? Like lagging. Because I'm looking over and I'm seeing a ton of people say they have

171
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:22,519
problems. And answer the poll honestly. Are you having problems watching this stream? Yes or no?

172
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:38,859
Answer truthfully. I want it to be answered completely and totally truthfully. Twitch,

173
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:50,980
it's happening on multiple streams. Shit. Oh, did we just deal with it? Did we just put up? I mean,

174
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:57,099
this is 20% of all of you apparently are having a problem. That's a lot of people. Is it all right?

175
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:10,630
Should we just deal with it? Sometimes it's regional. I wonder if this Twitch server problem

176
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:18,920
going to some of you guys. Because I would tell you, because you know me, man. If I have internet

177
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,380
problems, I will not stop talking about it. If I drop frames, you know for a fact I'm going to be

178
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,890
like, I don't understand. I don't get it. Why am I dropping frames? I don't understand. So I mean,

179
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:38,309
that's not happening at all. So I hope we're just going to power through it, I guess. So 20% of you,

180
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:47,400
I'm really sorry. But sucks that it's on this stream. I hope they figure that out because

181
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:53,619
that's not cool. All right, let's go. I'm sorry. I know a lot of you guys are going to be probably

182
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:00,140
spamming FS or F for stream, but we're going to power through it. It's not on my end. I'm really

183
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:07,210
sorry. But we're going. Germ of the grill master. I'm going to strangle your parents. Okay, that's

184
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,579
what's going to happen to them. I'm going to put my hands around their neck and strangle them.

185
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:17,259
Smoke meats for real old fashioned barbecue. Absolutely anywhere you go with the revolutionary

186
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:20,619
Red Devil, the portable outdoor kitchen from Quantum Homeware.

187
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:31,420
It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Just on grilling duty. This is the Red Devil

188
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,819
super skillet. This is what really makes a Red Devil a complete outdoor kitchen.

189
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:40,619
You simply remove the grilling rack and the radiant. Be careful over there. Be careful. Don't be too

190
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:49,420
rough. Let them like a beautiful grill. Beautiful day. I say you've got 15 burgers and five dogs

191
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:56,539
cooking on that big $400 grill that's never going to leave the guy. Yeah. Yup. I'm doing it. I'm

192
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:04,940
doing it. It's the worst job by the way. I don't know. Nobody can hear me, but still sit up here

193
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,859
all fucking God damn day with 15 patties here. Four of them are going to get eaten.

194
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,740
In fact, let me show you. Here's a meal you'd never dream of cooking on an outdoor grill

195
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,059
breakfast. Now our bacon and sausage need to be cooked on a high heat.

196
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:27,019
So we're going to put them on the middle ring. Remember that's the hot zone. Does anybody want

197
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:32,299
dogs? No one wants a dog.

198
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,880
So what's your favorite thing about the shade? Well, I even cook pizza too. I love pizza.

199
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,200
Yeah, you're my boy. Yeah, you are.

200
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,200
It's a fucking idiot. Bill, we've got something you're going to love under this one. Now you

201
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,240
don't believe in barbecue sauce, right? Right. You believe that. Say how many fucking hot dogs

202
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:08,200
I'm going to make at seven and then nobody eats them. Nobody eats seven dogs. You know, I'm going

203
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,519
to eat one. Those are fucking gross. This is raw. I don't even know what I'm doing up here.

204
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:19,480
The optional perfect chef grilling fork with a built-in meat thermometer.

205
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:28,359
What's that? Yeah, you want a burger? You do? Yes. Yeah, come on over here. I got

206
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,480
buns. I got ketchup. I've got mustard. This relish right here too. Please go for it.

207
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:41,400
Whose kid is this? He's going to Harvard. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. Little

208
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,240
Michael's going to Harvard. I'm telling you. This is what it's about. It's about grilling out here

209
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,920
with the family, with the friends, and yeah. All right. Okay. Okay. How much longer do I do this for?

210
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:07,049
That was awesome. Who's going to use this? All right, let's go. Let's get it.

211
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:26,539
Does it feel like that? My whole face hurts. What is that?

212
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:54,119
The new adventures of Morrowind. Might as well get started. Hi there.

213
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:02,309
Yes, we've been expecting you. You'll have to be recorded before you're officially released.

214
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:09,110
How? There are a few ways we can do this and the choice is yours. Wait, wait, me? Wait, me?

215
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:21,989
I get it. My name's Jerma. Nice to meet you. Interesting. Now, before I stamp these papers,

216
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:34,039
make sure this information is correct. Show your papers to the captain when you exit to get your

217
00:34:34,039 --> 00:35:26,010
release fee. Those fucking armpit stains, man, are insane. What's going on? A new scent is here.

218
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:34,099
I won't waste my time on the likes of you. Get out of here.

219
00:35:34,179 --> 00:36:07,530
What was I asking you, pal?

220
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:10,969
Is that Scoot with Shaggy?

221
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:47,210
Kitchen Duel, Season 2, Episode 3, culinary face-off.

222
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:52,309
It's a beautiful day, isn't it? It's good. Just on grilling duty.

223
00:36:53,739 --> 00:37:00,739
15 patties here. Four of them are going to get eaten. Stupid fucking idiots in this place.

224
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm going to eat one. I need two chops. I need two chops. Two chops. I don't even know what I'm

225
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:16,099
doing up here. That was pretty much raw. That was a raw hot dog that I say. I wish somebody

226
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:18,820
else could help me. I need a little more. Hire someone to do this next time so I don't have to

227
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:26,420
sit here and do this for three hours. Behind. Behind. Be careful over there. Be careful. Don't be too rough.

228
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:34,469
Behind. Let them like a beautiful grill. Beautiful day. Yeah, Chef. What are you doing?

229
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,670
I'm looking for the wontons. That's a funny hat. That's a funny hat that you have on.

230
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:49,349
Where are the wontons? Where are the wontons? Chef, where are the wontons? You closed the fridge

231
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:53,750
at the beginning of the tournament. Where are the wontons? I need them for my wonton soup thing

232
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,670
that I'm doing. Where are the wontons? I mean, I shouldn't be flipping these as much, but I am.

233
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:04,820
What are you doing up here? Can I have? Okay. Just flip. Fuck them. He's a maniac. I know.

234
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:11,050
I take a towel and I say what do you want? Yeah, my risotto is going to be in the oven in just

235
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:17,449
about five minutes, Chef. Yeah. I've got a creamy cheddar risotto and I also have a creamy broccoli

236
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:23,130
risotto and I also have a creamy mushroom risotto. Yeah, that's awesome. And then pork chops. Yes.

237
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:32,949
Sit up here all... I only know how to make risotto, but I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

238
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:37,750
This is done. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. First job, by the way.

239
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:49,980
Nobody can hear me, but time. Okay. Yep. Hi, chefs. What I made for you today is I have a creamy

240
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:56,780
mushroom risotto and a side of creamy broccoli risotto with a hint, a small portion of a creamy

241
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,460
mushroom risotto. And then what on the side of that, I also have creamy mushroom risotto

242
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:08,230
and a side of creamy chicken risotto with a hint, a small portion of a creamy mushroom risotto.

243
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,789
And then what on the side of that, I also have two creamy pork chops that I have created and I

244
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:19,510
seared to perfection and then finished off in the oven. Yeah. Come on over here. I got 15 patties

245
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:26,780
here. This is what it's about. It's about grilling out here with the family, with the friends,

246
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:34,300
and yeah. All right. Okay. You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.

247
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,500
You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows. You're just a mean guy that got a

248
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:46,010
bunch of TV shows and I'm not going to stand for it. You like it? It's just delicious.

249
00:39:48,230 --> 00:40:01,829
I'm not leaving. No, I think I deserve to win. I need to break that one down for a second.

250
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:07,880
My favorite part about the last one was how the guy with the grill is saying,

251
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,920
why don't I hire someone to be here and do this? What do you mean hire someone? Like you're the

252
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:24,170
chef. Why? Okay. What is this? E-clown poses as driving instructor. It's going to get you two

253
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:33,380
grades off. You're not getting your license today, by the way. No human drives a car like this. You

254
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,739
can get a chimpanzee in this car. You probably do better than the test than you did. You can get

255
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:41,059
an armadillo to do this test. You can get an ant. All right. Could you pull this way and park

256
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:48,679
for me, please? Right there, right there. Pull in smoothly. Smooth it out. Stop. Roll your window

257
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:54,199
down. You get me an army of ants and get them up to the wheel. Four or five thousand ants. What's

258
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:57,400
going on? I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine.

259
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:06,409
What is going on? Get out of the way. I'd like to try a new chicken. Yeah, I'll take two double

260
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:11,530
cheeseburgers. Two cheeseburgers. Three McChickens. You don't think I can do that? You don't think I

261
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:17,050
can train ants to do that? You don't think I'm smart enough to train ants? Can I have no sauce

262
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,769
on the McChickens? No sauce, please? What are you talking about? You can't do that here.

263
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:26,889
They don't wait. You can't do that here? Sir. I'm working that down on your exam.

264
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:34,630
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Give me the wheel. Let me show

265
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:42,119
you how it's done. Here, you hold this. Put the gas on. Oh, shit. Okay. Yep. This is how you do it.

266
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:57,219
This is how you drive a goddamn car. Okay. Well, uh, you got an F? Metal Gear Germa 2 tanker mission.

267
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,119
No, that'll be fine. It's the enemy. I need help. That'll be fine. It didn't sound broken.

268
00:42:52,599 --> 00:43:14,679
Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold on. There's a message. Hold on. Wait. There's a special message from

269
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:26,699
your look of it. I've got to answer it. Glove. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I

270
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:36,380
hear. Shut up. Shut up. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Stupid. You're all stupid

271
00:43:36,380 --> 00:44:57,780
idiots. Throw him out. Throw him out. Throw him out. When did I ever say that? Did I ever say that?

272
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:46,550
This is, uh, Ace Attorney. That was Otacon, was it? I thought it was me.

273
00:45:56,860 --> 00:47:11,909
It's a rare one. It's a rare one. I don't even know how this game works, but I feel like I would

274
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:13,269
like it, but I feel like I would hate it.

275
00:47:50,440 --> 00:48:01,929
Let's go. CTF Andy. You screwed that up. What you needed to do there is you had to.

276
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:39,429
Stupid. You're all stupid idiots. The enemy has taken our intelligence.

277
00:48:39,429 --> 00:48:44,260
I'm on the way to work right now. We can talk this later.

278
00:48:46,340 --> 00:49:11,590
Hello, I'm Jeremy. Okay. The actor. You know, how are we doing? How are we beginning at any point?

279
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:22,059
The tension, by the way, easy on the gas. Step on the gas. Little on gas. Step on the breaks.

280
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:29,369
Easy on the gas. Step. By the way, get four or five points on your license not going to go.

281
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:34,170
And I am a stickler. Very much so for these points. Easy on the gas. Step on the gas.

282
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:40,650
Keep your eyes on the road. Break. Easy on the gas. Step. Break. All right. That's enough. That's enough.

283
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:52,579
What? That was awesome. Here's another Mario Kart. Turbo Kart.

284
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:15,050
Is this real? Oh, I thought that was my mouse for a second.

285
00:50:34,300 --> 00:51:26,500
So ugly in that bottom right picture. Oh my God. What the fuck? You can grind.

286
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:50,300
It's out now. Germa Kart. All right. That was awesome. Trail cam footage. J-985.

287
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:57,079
Short version. Okay. Patient J and E mental asylum was reported missing from facility.

288
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:01,480
Patient J-985 was diagnosed with severe paranoid schizophrenia and was often seen hearing things

289
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,099
that are perceived. Being held in solitary confinement due to discretion towards other

290
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:28,329
patients and staff is a matter of security. Okay. Wildlife trail cam? Was that the splatoons?

291
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,050
I can tolerate them when they're in small doses.

292
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:11,320
Dude, is there something on me? Is there something on my back? Is there something on my back? Just

293
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,719
tell me. Get it. Get it. Get it. Dude, get it. Get it. Dude, come on. Just get it. Get it. What

294
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:19,320
is on my back? What's on my back? Dude, get it. Just get it. I'll stand still and hit it with that.

295
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:42,260
I'll hit it with a baseball bat. I don't care. Are you filming? I'm on TV. I think they're filming.

296
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:58,920
Hi mom. Hey mom, I'm on TV. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can I have the mic? No, you don't have to give it to me.

297
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:07,079
I'm on TV, mom. Look at me. I'm on TV. Oh, I'm on the television. Channel two. I'll leave. I'll leave.

298
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:48,659
The best part is I have a lav mic on. Like the clip-on lav mic. All right now, how does a train go?

299
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:06,570
Now then, how does your tricycle sound? Would you like your tricycle to sound?

300
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:11,690
Yeah, yeah.

301
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,820
What you see before you is a choice. A very important choice.

302
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:29,940
One that will live with you forever. What you can make and might be able to say to yourself is a key

303
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,219
inside of your eyeball, stick it up with your bare hand, and you can eat it. And spit it out,

304
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:34,320
You dig it up with your bare hands and eat it, and shit it out.

305
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,820
Shit it out, then only then do you need the keys.

306
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,219
Why would I have a tricycle this small?

307
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,860
Why wouldn't I get one for adults?

308
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:43,760
Get one for adults.

309
00:55:44,659 --> 00:55:46,059
Not one for children.

310
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:47,860
Adults can't ride these.

311
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:57,300
The Direct. The German 985 Direct?

312
00:55:59,159 --> 00:55:59,760
Okay.

313
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,389
Let's see what you got.

314
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:15,989
Excuse me.

315
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,909
Excuse me, fucking Peter Parker just showed up.

316
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,429
Where's Spider-Man?

317
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:28,030
I know, I know, Spider-Man's coming.

318
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:36,539
You're not going to get away, Green Goblin.

319
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:46,050
Wait, who's that new man?

320
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:48,590
Oh, a house.

321
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:01,519
What's new with these Nintendo Switch games?

322
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:16,210
See you on Friday.

323
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,840
I need two chops.

324
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,639
I need two chops.

325
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:22,239
Two chops.

326
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,559
I need a little more.

327
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,559
Pat, pass me the salt, please.

328
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:40,889
How are you?

329
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:42,769
How you feeling?

330
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,300
So it says here you have a little bit of a tummy ache.

331
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,900
Oh, I hate that.

332
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:56,659
Stop.

333
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,260
Slow down.

334
00:57:58,659 --> 00:58:00,659
I'm going to have to take off a few points for that one.

335
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,880
Wait, how was it?

336
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,280
What?

337
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,050
What is it?

338
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:30,030
What is that?

339
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,530
What was that?

340
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:31,230
A release date?

341
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,030
That's not real.

342
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,929
That's all for today's Nintendo Direct.

343
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:36,219
Thank you for watching.

344
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,500
That was awesome.

345
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,070
Tiny trouble.

346
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,780
Real funny.

348
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,079
Real funny stuff.

349
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:57,650
You did this.

350
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,519
You did this.

351
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,719
And you can fix it too, you know.

352
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:05,510
Unbelievable.

353
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:11,320
What a real piece of work you are.

354
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,480
I've got something to say to you.

355
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,480
And hopefully you listen this time.

356
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:17,989
You know what?

357
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,690
I can't even say it to you, but you know what I was going to say.

358
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:23,550
I was going to say,

359
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:25,449
forget you.

360
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,250
That's better.

361
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:27,349
Forget you.

362
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,949
You are a real piece of work.

363
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,260
Hopefully you can hear me.

364
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,280
So what?

365
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,480
I'm standing in the street.

366
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:48,849
Oh my God.

367
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:49,650
My rib cage.

368
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,050
You just see my fucking ribs.

369
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,179
It was my back rib.

370
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:54,579
You fucking idiot.

371
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:58,869
But this one's awesome.

372
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:01,369
Take me to a doctor.

373
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,099
Take me to a hospital.

374
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,440
Please.

375
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,639
You hit way too hard.

376
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,539
My butthole.

377
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,699
I feel like I'm at like a weird audition.

378
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:33,800
You're as an actor.

379
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,300
I feel like I'm at an audition right now.

380
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,599
There's like three people with clipboards over there and they're just like judging every word I'm saying.

381
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,300
How are we doing?

382
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:41,800
How are we?

383
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,099
Good?

384
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,920
You can you can begin at any point.

385
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:45,920
Wait, how?

386
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:47,719
What?

387
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,920
I'm going to be paying a lot of attention to what you're doing by the way.

388
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,179
I'm an actor and I'm a good one.

389
01:00:57,579 --> 01:01:02,579
A good actor can take a script and can change it and make it sound better in front of the camera.

390
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:03,780
I'm an actor.

391
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,579
Are you an actor?

392
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,079
Can you do this?

393
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:10,679
I don't know what that was but

394
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,369
just stay in your lane here please.

395
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:13,769
No.

396
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:15,829
I'm an actor.

397
01:01:16,429 --> 01:01:17,630
I act for a living.

398
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:25,449
I can't just like sit up here and just like fucking do like a one-man monologue show.

399
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:26,349
Okay.

400
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,550
I'm going to have to take a few points for that one.

401
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,949
It's going to get you two grades off.

402
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:32,750
I think like I'm just doing like an acting study.

403
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,949
Like I'm not who's going to use it for anything.

404
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:35,550
All right.

405
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,650
Yeah, we're going to play a new song.

406
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,750
This one is something we've been working on for a long time.

407
01:01:38,949 --> 01:01:40,349
I hope you all enjoy it.

408
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:41,750
It doesn't have a name.

409
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,849
It's currently untitled.

410
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:45,210
So that's what we're going to do.

411
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,409
It's an untitled song and I hope you enjoy it.

412
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:50,710
Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show.

413
01:01:57,909 --> 01:01:58,309
All right.

414
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:58,909
That's enough.

415
01:01:58,909 --> 01:01:59,510
That's enough.

416
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:00,809
Very nice.

417
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:02,449
Now that was a good one.

418
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:12,449
And now we proudly present to you the tale of the great King Jeremiah, son of Elvin.

419
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:28,949
I want everyone to understand that the king made a lot of good things happen today.

420
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:29,650
Don't you think?

421
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:32,429
You little jester over there.

422
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:33,329
You're so funny.

423
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,440
It's like show 200 of my residency in Vegas.

424
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,170
Feed him to the lions.

425
01:02:44,269 --> 01:02:46,940
I feed him.

426
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,440
Feed him to the lions.

427
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,139
Don't you think?

428
01:02:56,769 --> 01:02:57,670
I don't know how to torque.

429
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,239
How do you, how do you torque?

430
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:03,000
Get the crown off.

431
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,210
Don't mind if I do.

432
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,210
Don't mind if I do.

433
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:18,980
The king's treasures are so heavy.

434
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,579
There must be so many things in here.

435
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,079
Let me take a look.

436
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:22,780
Stop.

437
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:23,980
Criminal scum.

438
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:34,480
Yeah, that was, that was seriously like, oh guys, I've got this show in Las Vegas.

439
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,280
I've got residency in this place, whatever, whatever city.

440
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,579
And that's after like 180 shows.

441
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:42,659
I'm just completely phoning it in.

442
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:46,360
And it's just like, it's, everyone's giving me terrible reviews on TripAdvisor.

443
01:03:48,369 --> 01:03:49,469
Jerma show trailer.

444
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:56,000
The world he inhabits is in some respects counterfeit.

445
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,610
There's nothing fake about Jerma himself.

446
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,039
No script, no cue card.

447
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:06,320
It isn't always Shakespeare, but it's genuine.

448
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:08,900
It's a life.

449
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:19,820
If you're not going to make it, you're going to have to.

450
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,820
I don't even want to watch them.

451
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,619
No way, mister.

452
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,489
You're going to the top of this mountain, broken legs and all.

453
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,280
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.

454
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:48,969
Well, for me, there is no, there is no difference between a private life and a public life.

455
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:52,269
My life is my life, is the Truman Show.

456
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:54,869
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

457
01:04:54,869 --> 01:04:56,269
It's a noble life.

458
01:04:56,269 --> 01:05:01,619
It is a truly blessed life.

459
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:03,219
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

460
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,360
All right, promise me one thing though.

461
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:14,539
If I die before it reaches the summit, you'll use me as an alternative source.

462
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,599
It's all true.

463
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:23,699
It's all real.

464
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:25,000
Nothing here is fake.

465
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,900
Nothing you see on this show is fake.

466
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,199
It's merely controlled.

467
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,199
Oh my God.

468
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,539
It's an order.

469
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,119
Oh my God.

470
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:09,659
Howdy.

471
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:10,460
Good morning.

472
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,889
But in case I don't see you.

473
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:14,889
Good afternoon.

474
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:15,289
Good evening.

475
01:06:15,289 --> 01:06:15,889
Good night.

476
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,699
Why?

477
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:22,449
All right.

478
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:23,949
Yeah, the whole, all right.

479
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:28,599
Yes.

480
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:28,900
Yes.

481
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,199
Okay.

482
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:32,969
We had to, for those of you that weren't here last time, I need to make sure I say this.

483
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:39,659
Somebody edited the entire Truman Show movie and put me in every single scene.

484
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:42,260
It must have taken weeks to do.

485
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,559
It must have taken so long.

486
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:46,630
I, and we had to, we had to deny it.

487
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:48,230
We can't, we can't show that.

488
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:50,739
We can't show the entire movie.

489
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:52,239
That's not going to happen.

490
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:57,429
Truman Show is a beloved movie that's still available to purchase.

491
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:00,130
I cannot tell you to go do that.

492
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,230
I cannot tell you to watch that.

493
01:07:01,429 --> 01:07:03,329
All I can tell you is that's insane.

494
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,170
That's absolutely insane.

495
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:06,750
Okay.

496
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,949
How on earth do you balance like that?

497
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,730
They said it took over two months.

498
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:15,519
Why?

499
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:20,869
That's ridiculous.

500
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:23,530
I can't.

501
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:27,920
All right.

502
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,420
Let's keep going.

503
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,320
This is how on earth do you balance like that?

504
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,110
How do you do that?

505
01:07:37,110 --> 01:08:12,579
How on earth do you balance like that?

506
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:26,680
I think there, do we, I think we saw this one.

507
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:40,609
Oh, did we not?

508
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:46,420
What just happened?

509
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,460
Do you ever get scammed in RuneScape?

510
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,460
That was insane.

511
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:54,220
All right.

512
01:08:54,220 --> 01:09:12,319
Oh, a magical potion?

513
01:09:12,619 --> 01:09:13,520
This is for me?

514
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:14,819
No way.

515
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,020
Thank you.

516
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,619
How much do I owe you, stranger?

517
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,819
Ten pieces of gold?

518
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:25,380
That's a steal.

519
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:36,460
That hurts a little.

520
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:39,590
Hey.

521
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:40,090
Does it feel like that?

522
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,779
It feels, my whole face hurts.

523
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:44,680
My face is burning.

524
01:09:46,029 --> 01:09:47,029
That burns a lot.

525
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:48,529
What the?

526
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:50,529
What is that?

527
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:03,149
Compact Man Strikes Fear Part 2.

528
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:05,250
Sure was a block away from where he just was.

529
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,149
He was trying to hide from the cops but got stuck on a park bench.

530
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:10,149
I think he's too scared to get down or something.

531
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,750
Just get him down before the cops arrest him.

532
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:15,970
3D movie maker, Pog.

533
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,869
Time streamer in sat, preparing to make an arrest.

534
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:24,260
Hey, I need you to stop.

535
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,989
Oh shit.

536
01:10:27,989 --> 01:10:28,789
You got...

537
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:29,789
I ain't touching that.

538
01:10:29,789 --> 01:10:30,789
You know what you're doing.

539
01:10:30,789 --> 01:10:31,989
Jerma, what the fuck?

540
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:32,989
Are you stuck up there?

541
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:35,989
Here, walk down and get the hell out of here, dude.

542
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:43,029
All right, Jerma's on the move and the UFO hasn't shown up yet.

543
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:44,630
I don't know what's taking it so long.

544
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,229
I called it like 10 minutes ago.

545
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:50,229
I wonder if there's some sort of transition or something that could make this go by a lot quicker.

546
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:52,029
Can we watch something else?

547
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:53,329
It's about to get really good.

548
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:54,229
It's about to get really good.

549
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:54,729
Trust me.

550
01:10:54,729 --> 01:10:58,670
Rats, rats, pull you out of racks, work it back.

551
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,170
Those bullies won't bother me.

552
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,359
Hey, we're here. Sorry we took so long.

553
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:14,130
What's he doing now?

554
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,630
Get him out of here. He's being cringe.

555
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:18,130
I'm not cringe.

556
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:23,319
I'm cringe plus.

557
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:24,420
There's a difference.

558
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:29,779
Jerma, did you just kill people while you were down there the whole time?

559
01:11:29,779 --> 01:11:31,340
Huh?

560
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:34,140
Like at that store, you only killed people, right?

561
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,840
Yes.

562
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,340
Did you get any money?

563
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,909
All right. Well, all of our time has been wasted.

564
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:41,310
I don't know how we're going to end it here or we can-

565
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:54,949
Well, unfortunately, I have to diagnose you with cringe.

566
01:11:58,029 --> 01:12:00,930
Jerma Life 2, shoddily shortened version.

567
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,430
Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman.

568
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:06,829
Rise and shine.

569
01:12:06,829 --> 01:12:10,720
Wait, how was it? What?

570
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:15,920
Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job.

571
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,220
No one is more deserving of a rest.

572
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:25,920
And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until...

573
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,220
Well, let's just say your hour has come again.

574
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,220
Huh?

575
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:39,810
The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.

576
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:42,609
So wake up, Mr. Freeman.

577
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:46,810
Wake up and smell the ashes.

578
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,079
This got a lot of use.

579
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:08,369
Hey, mom, I'm on TV. I'm sorry.

580
01:14:08,369 --> 01:14:09,369
I'm sorry. Can I have a mic?

581
01:14:09,369 --> 01:14:11,369
Are you? How did you get in here?

582
01:14:11,369 --> 01:14:12,369
I'm on TV, mom.

583
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:14,369
Look at me, I'm on TV.

584
01:14:14,369 --> 01:14:24,520
Dude, is this something on me? Is this something on my back?

585
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,520
Is this something on my back? Just tell me. Get it.

586
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,520
Hey, you can see the whole park from here. Can you see?

587
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,520
That's crazy.

588
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,520
Dude, look, you can see. You can see the water rides.

589
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,520
I didn't even know there was a park had water rides.

590
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,789
Jesus.

591
01:14:41,789 --> 01:14:43,789
Get an army of pants and get them up to the wheel.

592
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:45,789
Four or five thousand minutes.

593
01:14:45,789 --> 01:14:48,789
And I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine.

594
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:51,789
Do you see what's in front of us? You do, right?

595
01:14:51,789 --> 01:14:52,789
What's in front of us?

596
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:53,789
Holy crap!

597
01:14:54,789 --> 01:14:56,479
God!

598
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:58,159
Thank you for that!

599
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,159
Die, you motherfucker!

600
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,159
No!

601
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:06,659
Oh, here I go!

602
01:15:06,659 --> 01:15:07,659
What?

603
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,279
What?

604
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,279
What is going on?

605
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:15,279
Yahoo!

606
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:17,279
Is this the same video?

607
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:29,560
No, it's a different video.

608
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,560
What is going on?

609
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,039
Oh, just hit.

610
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:39,880
Yahoo!

611
01:15:39,880 --> 01:16:00,310
What's he doing out here?

612
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,310
Are you guys friends?

613
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Oh my God.

614
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,229
Shut the fuck up.

615
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,380
This water is so dirty.

616
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:30,060
I learned this one when I was traveling abroad, right?

617
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,449
What?

618
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,800
That's it?

619
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,800
Wait, what?

620
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:18,079
It's so hot.

621
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:19,079
What a terrible day to be cooking in the kitchen.

622
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:21,079
Didn't even go in the kitchen.

623
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:24,079
How did you make all this incredible looking food?

624
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,079
That's why I invited everybody here today.

625
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:28,079
I want to show you something.

626
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:29,079
Red devil.

627
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,079
I have found that it's so revolutionary.

628
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:34,079
It has literally changed the way we think about cooking.

629
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:41,079
When I take a tally, when I take a tally, when I say, what do you want?

630
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:43,079
Do you want a burger or do you want a dog?

631
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:44,079
Dog, dog, dog.

632
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:46,079
I think a fucking dog.

633
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:51,079
Bill, we've got something you're going to love under this one.

634
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:54,079
Now, you don't believe in barbecue sauce, right?

635
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:57,079
You believe that true barbecue should be smoked, right?

636
01:17:57,079 --> 01:17:58,079
Look at this.

637
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:02,079
Just add moist wood chips underneath the grilling rack.

638
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:03,079
I like mesquite.

639
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:08,079
And you can cook meats like delicious smoked turkey, even real old fashioned barbecue ribs.

640
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:11,079
You know, the super skillet really is the perfect block.

641
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:14,079
But there's a much more important reason for this curved design.

642
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:15,079
Ah, that's right.

643
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:16,079
You see what I'm doing?

644
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:17,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

645
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:18,079
That's what I'm doing here.

646
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:19,079
Shut up.

647
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:22,760
You look like a kick out of chef school.

648
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,760
I did.

649
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,760
Shut up.

650
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,760
Just look at that.

651
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,760
That's great.

652
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,760
But watch this.

653
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,760
Here's where it gets really handy.

654
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:35,760
Simply connect the stay cool handles, carry the super skillet to the table, set it on the

655
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,760
Red Devil's serving cradle, and dig in.

656
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,760
Look at that.

657
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,760
From cookware to heated serving ware in seconds.

658
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,760
Does anybody want dogs?

659
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,760
No one wants a dog.

660
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,760
Great.

661
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,760
As you can see, you really can cook anything, anywhere with the Red Devil's portable outdoor

662
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,760
kitchen.

663
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,760
That was so funny.

664
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,760
The fact that like, oh, you don't believe in barbecue sauce.

665
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,760
No, I don't.

666
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,760
It's disgusting.

667
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,760
What does that even mean?

668
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,760
Okay.

669
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,760
This is rare footage of Mario's original voice actor.

670
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,760
Okay.

671
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,760
What?

672
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,760
What is this?

673
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,760
Let me tell you something.

674
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:58,760
I said no.

675
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,760
And he said my girls.

676
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,760
Drugs.

677
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,510
Or drink.

678
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,510
If anyone ever precious to you.

679
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:04,510
Or said.

680
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:05,510
Something.

681
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,510
I don't know.

682
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:07,510
I don't know.

683
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,510
I don't know.

684
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,510
I don't know.

685
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:10,939
I don't know.

686
01:19:10,939 --> 01:19:11,939
I don't know.

687
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:12,939
I don't know.

688
01:19:12,939 --> 01:19:21,970
I don't know.

689
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:32,239
I don't know.

690
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:43,840
I don't know.

691
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:44,840
I don't know.

692
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,750
What the hell?

693
01:19:47,750 --> 01:20:00,039
Swing your arms.

694
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:03,460
Jesus.

695
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:08,989
None of this is real.

696
01:20:08,989 --> 01:20:09,989
This is a fictional story.

697
01:20:09,989 --> 01:20:10,989
This is a fun.

698
01:20:10,989 --> 01:20:12,930
This is a funny.

699
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,109
This is just a fictional story.

700
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,539
Not fun.

701
01:20:15,539 --> 01:20:21,449
This is a fictional story.

702
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:22,449
None of this is real.

703
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:24,199
None of this is anything.

704
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:25,199
Wait, look out.

705
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:59,319
What was that?

706
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:00,319
Oh, yo, what's up?

707
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:05,600
Hey, I'm.

708
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,600
Yeah.

709
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,600
I'm.

710
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,649
I'm.

711
01:21:11,649 --> 01:21:12,649
I'm.

712
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:13,649
I'm.

713
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:14,649
I'm.

714
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:15,649
I'm.

715
01:21:15,649 --> 01:21:16,649
I'm.

716
01:21:16,649 --> 01:21:17,649
I'm.

717
01:21:17,649 --> 01:21:22,859
I'm.

718
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:27,619
I'm.

719
01:21:27,619 --> 01:21:30,840
I'm.

720
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,840
I'm.

721
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

722
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:35,210
I knew you were coming.

723
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:36,210
So I got you ready.

724
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:38,649
That's your extra whip, extra cream, extra sugar, extra not coffee.

725
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:39,649
How much?

726
01:21:39,649 --> 01:21:40,649
There you go.

727
01:21:40,649 --> 01:21:41,649
Take it, man.

728
01:21:41,649 --> 01:21:42,649
Yeah.

729
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:43,649
How you doing?

730
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:44,649
I just got a heart attack.

731
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:45,649
Yeah, I think it wasn't close enough.

732
01:21:45,649 --> 01:21:46,649
Oh, fuck.

733
01:21:46,649 --> 01:21:47,649
Oh, fuck.

734
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:48,649
Oh, fuck.

735
01:21:48,649 --> 01:21:49,649
Oh, fuck.

736
01:21:49,649 --> 01:21:50,649
Oh, fuck.

737
01:21:50,649 --> 01:21:51,649
Oh, fuck.

738
01:21:51,649 --> 01:21:52,649
Oh, fuck.

739
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:54,210
Oh, fuck.

740
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,210
Oh, fuck.

741
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,210
Oh, fuck.

742
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:57,210
Oh, fuck.

743
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,210
Oh, fuck.

744
01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:59,210
Oh, fuck.

745
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:05,000
Oh, fuck.

746
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Oh, fuck.

747
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Oh, fuck.

748
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,170
Oh, a cookie!

749
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,760
Let's see if you can deal with this!

750
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:59,210
Rats! Rats! We are the rats!

751
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,210
That's crazy.

752
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:02,390
Seduce me, Jerma.

753
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:03,390
Seduce me.

754
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:05,390
That's not- I'm not gonna do it. I can't do it.

755
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:06,390
Seduce me.

756
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:08,390
Baby, my heart's on fire.

757
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:10,390
And if you refuse me, baby, you'll lose me.

758
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,390
And you'll be left alone.

759
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:13,390
And tell me, tell me.

760
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:15,390
That I'm your boy.

761
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:18,390
Seduce me!

762
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:26,899
Wait, hold on. Wait.

763
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:30,289
It went too quick.

764
01:23:30,289 --> 01:23:34,180
Okay, Jerma- JermaRPG versus

765
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,609
Jermaaker 9.85

766
01:23:37,609 --> 01:23:39,609
Final boss and ending HD.

767
01:23:39,609 --> 01:23:45,420
Okay, let's start this over.

768
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:07,970
See you later, man.

769
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:29,399
I see something horrible.

770
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:32,079
Oh my god.

771
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:33,579
Damnit.

772
01:24:33,579 --> 01:24:35,579
Sentry going up.

773
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:38,579
The room is about to go down.

774
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:41,579
Sentry down!

775
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:42,579
Spider.

776
01:24:42,579 --> 01:24:43,579
Spider.

777
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:44,579
Spider.

778
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,960
Here I go, here I go.

779
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:58,079
Here I go, here I go, here I go.

780
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:00,079
You!

781
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:06,220
Who's that new man?

782
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:25,750
Whoa. Oh. Oh, he's very angry.

783
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:26,750
I'm sweating.

784
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:29,750
I'm sweating my ass off of this thing.

785
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:37,880
Jesus Christ!

786
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:50,420
Jesus Christ!

787
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:20,079
Jesus Christ!

788
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:27,050
Stop!

789
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,880
Okay.

790
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,279
That one.

791
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:52,279
That was like the creator of Boshi.

792
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:55,279
Just listed out- just went-

793
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:59,279
Just listed out every like Recess- kid at Recess's

794
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:01,279
thing that they're doing in Imagination Land out in Recess.

795
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:02,460
And made a game.

796
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:09,720
That was-

797
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,720
I don't even know what to say about that one.

798
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:12,960
That was just-

799
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,960
It was so much stimulation.

800
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:23,399
Do you think that when the internet was created,

801
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:25,399
they ever thought that something like that was ever going to get made?

802
01:27:25,399 --> 01:27:32,640
Where's like the like event horizon of the internet?

803
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,640
You know what I mean?

804
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,640
Like when there's no going back at some point.

805
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,939
It's kind of-

806
01:27:37,939 --> 01:27:45,390
It's insane.

807
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:46,390
That was unbelievable.

808
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:47,390
All right.

809
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:48,390
I open up about my fantasies.

810
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,390
Let's see what this one is.

811
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,590
So-

812
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:52,590
So, my fantasy is,

813
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:55,590
this wicked handsome doctor in bike shorts comes in.

814
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:57,850
60 tall,

815
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:00,050
lean cut.

816
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:02,050
And he moves in a false tride.

817
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:03,050
You know what I mean?

818
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:05,050
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

819
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:06,050
I got it, I got it.

820
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,050
It pulls up a license.

821
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:08,050
I got it.

822
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:09,420
60, by the way.

823
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,420
And he looks fucking amazing.

824
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,420
Oh my God.

825
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,239
Let me check to see how he looks.

826
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:16,239
Cut up-

827
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:17,239
blemish free, blowing hair.

828
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:18,239
Healthy?

829
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,239
Very, very healthy sounding.

830
01:28:19,239 --> 01:28:21,239
Very healthy.

831
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:22,239
Yeah,

832
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:25,560
I haven't had a headache by the way in a long time. If I fly is not down, right?

833
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,640
I'm not gonna get in trouble. You want to eat some bugs?

834
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:35,369
And we eat bugs together and have a romantic relationship

835
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:37,890
of some kind?

836
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:43,590
Where is that from?

837
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:46,470
Supernatural?

838
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:55,550
I can't move. You're a razor burn. What's your name? My name is uh...

839
01:28:56,390 --> 01:29:00,359
My name was not born actually. What's going on?

840
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:03,239
A lot of fucking weird shit.

841
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:07,000
You did this.

842
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,800
You did this and you can fix it too. This can't be right.

843
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:19,039
I'm killing you. I'm killing you. I don't care about anything else. I don't give a shit about anything else.

844
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:21,880
Back up. Everybody back up. I'll prove it. What is this?

845
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:26,600
I don't know what that is. My programming is just get... What is this? Why does this exist?

846
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,239
I don't know. This fucking guy is explaining this to me right now.

847
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:47,109
Shave, Sean.

848
01:29:47,149 --> 01:29:56,710
Are you scared? Yeah, I bet you are. I bet you're scared. I'm not scared at all.

849
01:29:56,710 --> 01:30:02,920
You're in Knockout City.

850
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:34,720
Round one. Let's start with the basics. Get a hit before they hit you.

851
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:39,520
Oh, that looked like it hurt. You gotta learn to catch if you wanna...

852
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,520
Like that. This cat's gotta figure it out.

853
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,520
This game looks fun. What is this?

854
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:48,520
On a quest to be the best. They're putting the skills to the test.

855
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:52,520
And class is in session, baby.

856
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,520
Oh man, that's just mean.

857
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,520
Is this game fun?

858
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,560
You cool, but some advice.

859
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,560
That's good.

860
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,560
Get yourself a crew.

861
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:08,079
Going solo in this city will only get you so far.

862
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:13,079
When brawlers unite, it's like poetry in motion.

863
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:17,079
But hey, it's not all throws and KOs.

864
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:21,079
Go the extra mile and define that style.

865
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:24,079
And as your crew ups its ranking on the streets,

866
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:28,119
there's an opportunity to claim some serious loot.

867
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:33,640
Okay, back to the action.

868
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:37,199
I'm telling you, this city has it all.

869
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:41,199
Team KO, face off, ball up brawl.

870
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:45,199
There's many brawls to play and a lot more on the way.

871
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:48,199
You've got environment second life for you

872
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:52,199
and weapons that can change the tide of battle.

873
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:54,199
This took a lot of time.

874
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,239
You can't get the job done.

875
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,239
Well, you can.

876
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:05,640
There's so many small edits.

877
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,710
Just remember, this ain't dodge ball.

878
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:13,329
It's dodge brawl.

879
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:33,560
Up and show me what you got.

880
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,560
I'll be watching.

881
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:42,020
They will knock out city.

882
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:45,020
I guess you could play it today if you'd like to.

883
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,020
Oh no.

884
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,020
Not what I want you to do.

885
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,020
Another driving one.

886
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:53,130
Very important part of your test.

887
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:55,130
Driving through a drive through is very hard.

888
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:56,310
Why?

889
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:58,310
It's a very narrow road.

890
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:00,310
It's a very narrow part.

891
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:02,310
It's hard to navigate in there.

892
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:04,310
Okay.

893
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:06,310
Right in here.

894
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:08,310
Pull in smoothly.

895
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:10,609
Smooth it out.

896
01:33:10,609 --> 01:33:14,630
Stop.

897
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,630
Get out of the way.

898
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:22,630
I'll take two double cheeseburgers.

899
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:25,289
Three McChickens.

900
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,130
Two double cheeseburgers.

901
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:34,369
Three McChickens.

902
01:33:34,369 --> 01:33:36,869
Can I have no sauce?

903
01:33:36,869 --> 01:33:39,239
On the McChickens.

904
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,920
No sauce please.

905
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,920
They don't wait.

906
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,920
You can't do that here.

907
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,920
I'm working that down on your exam.

908
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,920
Why?

909
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,920
I'm doing McDonald's without sauce.

910
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,920
You can't take it off.

911
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,920
That's okay.

912
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,960
Do you want anything?

913
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,960
Small Coke.

914
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,960
And a small drink.

915
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,960
One small Coke please.

916
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:05,960
And that's it.

917
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,420
Is the car keyed in?

918
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:24,520
I have the power of God.

919
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:31,359
What just happened?

920
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:33,359
I ain't going to be doing that.

921
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:35,359
You go ahead and sell that one.

922
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:37,920
Who's going to buy that?

923
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,920
Are you serious?

924
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,350
No, that company's going under.

925
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:45,350
There's no way they're going to have them.

926
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:47,350
Their earnings are probably terrible.

927
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:49,590
Very much so.

928
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:53,300
Why is the leash so fucked up?

929
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,300
I have to drive over.

930
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:58,050
You can merge over there if you want.

931
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:00,930
Is it alive? I don't know.

932
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,930
So slowly merge.

933
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

934
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:06,930
Behind.

935
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:10,960
Behind.

936
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,649
It's not there.

937
01:35:13,649 --> 01:35:29,079
Finishing touches.

938
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:31,800
Red.

939
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,260
Looks very good.

940
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:37,260
Very good.

941
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:39,260
We didn't see very much painter, I will say.

942
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:41,949
I don't like this.

943
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:43,949
Buy any company that makes...

944
01:35:43,949 --> 01:35:46,250
What the hell are they called?

945
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:48,250
I don't know.

946
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:50,250
For the kids, I'll watch it. TikTok.

947
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,250
Can you buy TikTok? How do you buy that?

948
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:58,569
My son's into it. Big time.

949
01:35:58,569 --> 01:36:00,569
I may have wanted to cook...

950
01:36:00,609 --> 01:36:02,979
I'm sorry.

951
01:36:02,979 --> 01:36:06,630
I think yours might be done.

952
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,630
More than mine.

953
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:10,630
Oh no, they all peeped in.

954
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:29,569
Yeah, I didn't mean to hang up on you that hard.

955
01:36:29,569 --> 01:36:31,569
I didn't mean to hang up on one of your employees.

956
01:36:31,569 --> 01:36:33,569
No, of course not.

957
01:36:33,569 --> 01:36:35,569
I'm so sorry.

958
01:36:35,569 --> 01:36:37,569
I don't want to buy Google stock.

959
01:36:37,569 --> 01:36:39,569
I want to buy the TikTok company.

960
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:53,670
That was...

961
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:56,460
That was ridiculous.

962
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:00,300
Oh my god.

963
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,500
Okay.

964
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,500
This one is called a daytime television show.

965
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:09,470
Jigsaw is here.

966
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
How did he get in here?

967
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,880
How did he get in here?

968
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,880
You're not supposed to be able to get in here.

969
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:30,270
No, no, no, no.

970
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:32,270
Stop, stop, stop.

971
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:34,270
You didn't make your choice.

972
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:36,310
Oh shit.

973
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:43,439
Hi everyone.

974
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:48,880
My name is Sean Elberton.

975
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,880
I'm the actor, writer, director, producer

976
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,880
and main talent of the

977
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,880
daytime television show

978
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:00,569
Jigsaw is here.

979
01:38:00,569 --> 01:38:02,569
And I just have something very important

980
01:38:02,569 --> 01:38:04,750
that we all have to do. We have to make choices.

981
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,750
And one choice is for you to watch this show.

982
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,239
Because the ratings have been very poor

983
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:12,060
and I believe that we are

984
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,060
below reruns of infomercials

985
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:16,060
at this point.

986
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,100
So I figured we could give you a quick little

987
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,100
maybe you could watch the show if you want.

988
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:22,100
I think you're going to love it even more now

989
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,100
because look what we can do.

990
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,100
Big, thick, man-sized sandwiches.

991
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:40,319
Yeah!

992
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:43,460
I almost just took down the whole camera.

993
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:03,149
Come on, let's go. Let's do it.

994
01:39:03,149 --> 01:39:05,149
No, no, no.

995
01:39:05,149 --> 01:39:07,579
Oh, hello.

996
01:39:07,579 --> 01:39:09,579
It's a me, Mario.

997
01:39:09,619 --> 01:39:11,619
Oh, bingo.

998
01:39:11,619 --> 01:39:13,619
Oh, haha.

999
01:39:13,619 --> 01:39:15,619
Oh, hello.

1000
01:39:15,619 --> 01:39:17,619
It's a me, Mario.

1001
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,619
Oh, where's Luigi?

1002
01:39:21,619 --> 01:39:26,930
Where's Luigi?

1003
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,520
Oh, bingo.

1004
01:40:31,899 --> 01:40:36,319
Breaking news tonight is an army of

1005
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:38,319
moderately sized Bostonian men flood

1006
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:40,659
the city streets.

1007
01:40:40,659 --> 01:40:42,659
We join our correspondent in the midst of the chaos.

1008
01:40:42,659 --> 01:40:44,659
Thanks. Onyx here.

1009
01:40:44,659 --> 01:40:46,659
It's complete pandemonium out in the street

1010
01:40:46,659 --> 01:40:48,659
where posse of compact streamers

1011
01:40:48,659 --> 01:40:50,659
are causing complete

1012
01:40:50,659 --> 01:40:52,659
and total chaos.

1013
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:57,090
Police reports state that the outbreak was caused

1014
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:59,090
in a car accident with a mythical streamer

1015
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:01,090
Sherman985 who sent his army of clones

1016
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:03,090
to wreak havoc on our mortal plane.

1017
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:05,090
All citizens are advised to arm themselves

1018
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:07,090
and stay indoors until the crisis is over.

1019
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:09,130
It's TV. I'm sorry.

1020
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:11,130
Can I have the mic?

1021
01:41:11,130 --> 01:41:13,130
I'm on TV.

1022
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:15,130
I'm on the television.

1023
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:17,130
Channel 2.

1024
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:19,130
I'm doing a thing.

1025
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:21,130
I'll leave.

1026
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:26,060
Who is it?

1027
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:33,710
Hello again.

1028
01:41:33,710 --> 01:41:35,710
Hello. Okay.

1029
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:38,329
I'm here to do something other than ruin my

1030
01:41:38,329 --> 01:41:40,329
watermelons.

1031
01:41:40,369 --> 01:41:43,000
But you have a choice to make

1032
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,430
and it's time for you to make it.

1033
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:48,689
You want a choice?

1034
01:41:48,689 --> 01:41:54,319
Let's dance.

1035
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:56,319
So fellas, what do you think?

1036
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:00,630
This is show business.

1037
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:02,630
Nothing about this.

1038
01:42:08,199 --> 01:42:11,649
That was ridiculous.

1039
01:42:11,649 --> 01:42:13,649
One chef. Hold on. Wait.

1040
01:42:13,649 --> 01:42:17,159
We got another chef one coming up.

1041
01:42:17,159 --> 01:42:19,159
Was that machinima?

1042
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:23,359
That was awesome.

1043
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:29,119
That kid's going to Harvard.

1044
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:31,119
Alright.

1045
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:33,550
Let's do this one.

1046
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:41,550
Chef Jerma goes on Hell's Kitchen.

1047
01:42:41,550 --> 01:42:44,239
One chef is just lost.

1048
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:51,449
Hi chefs.

1049
01:42:51,449 --> 01:42:53,449
What I made for you today is I have

1050
01:42:53,449 --> 01:42:55,760
a creamy mushroom risotto

1051
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,760
and a side of creamy broccoli risotto

1052
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,760
with a hint, a small portion

1053
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,760
of a creamy chicken risotto

1054
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,760
and then on the side of that I also have

1055
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,760
two pork chops that I have created

1056
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,800
and I seared to perfection

1057
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:10,229
and then finished off in the oven.

1058
01:43:10,229 --> 01:43:19,829
Yes chef.

1059
01:43:19,829 --> 01:43:22,579
It's not good?

1060
01:43:22,579 --> 01:43:24,579
What do you mean it's not good?

1061
01:43:24,579 --> 01:43:27,010
It's a perfect

1062
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:29,010
risotto. It's perfect.

1063
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:31,010
It's a perfect risotto.

1064
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:35,010
Creepy mushroom risotto and you don't have

1065
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:37,010
a fucking talent to save your life

1066
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:39,010
you fucking idiot.

1067
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:41,010
You dirty pig! Get out!

1068
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:43,010
Get out!

1069
01:43:47,539 --> 01:43:49,539
No, we already saw this.

1070
01:43:49,539 --> 01:43:51,539
You can't just put it in again.

1071
01:43:51,539 --> 01:43:53,539
Okay, everybody settle down.

1072
01:43:53,539 --> 01:43:55,539
We already did this one.

1073
01:43:55,539 --> 01:43:58,100
Why is it in here again?

1074
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:02,710
Not again.

1075
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:05,909
Hello.

1076
01:44:05,909 --> 01:44:07,909
Guess what? You can hear me, huh?

1077
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,149
You can hear me pretty well.

1078
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:12,149
Don't put this in here.

1079
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:16,439
I'm not going to drink it.

1080
01:44:16,439 --> 01:44:23,090
You didn't finish it this time.

1081
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,329
No, I'm not going to finish it.

1082
01:44:25,329 --> 01:44:29,750
Isn't that what they wanted?

1083
01:44:29,789 --> 01:44:37,000
Sneak? Practical problems.

1084
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,020
I don't know.

1085
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:43,020
I don't know.

1086
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:45,020
Times two speed is still two and a half hours.

1087
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:47,319
And you know that you have rights?

1088
01:44:47,319 --> 01:44:50,439
Call me.

1089
01:44:50,439 --> 01:44:55,680
What is it again?

1090
01:44:55,680 --> 01:45:12,699
Times two speed.

1091
01:45:12,699 --> 01:45:15,689
Pretend not to understand and throw it.

1092
01:45:15,689 --> 01:45:17,689
What is wrong with this guy?

1093
01:45:17,689 --> 01:45:33,880
This mustache shirt guy has been doing a lot of fucking weird shit.

1094
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:37,920
I was going to do routine where I shake my balls.

1095
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,420
Okay, we're done.

1096
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:44,800
We're done with this one.

1097
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:50,149
Where am I?

1098
01:45:50,149 --> 01:45:58,399
What's going on here?

1099
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:02,369
See you later.

1100
01:46:02,369 --> 01:46:04,369
Skyrim, but everyone is me.

1101
01:46:04,369 --> 01:46:10,560
I made things happen.

1102
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,930
I raised taxes on everybody.

1103
01:46:12,930 --> 01:46:14,930
Every single person now owes 40% more taxes.

1104
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:18,069
That means more money for the kingdom.

1105
01:46:18,069 --> 01:46:23,189
Oh yeah.

1106
01:46:23,189 --> 01:46:25,189
Well, it's not the common cold.

1107
01:46:25,189 --> 01:46:27,189
I unfortunately have to diagnose you with cringe.

1108
01:46:29,489 --> 01:46:32,630
What's that?

1109
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:35,489
What did you say?

1110
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:37,770
I'm going to feed him.

1111
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:39,770
Feed him to the lions, don't you think?

1112
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:45,770
You're in trouble.

1113
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:47,770
You're in trouble.

1114
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:54,890
I have the power of God and anime on my side.

1115
01:46:58,539 --> 01:47:00,840
What are those pictures in the background?

1116
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,340
Is that AI shit?

1117
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:05,840
Let's go.

1118
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:28,220
Sire, get down.

1119
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:30,760
I've been a Jedi agent the whole time.

1120
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:44,840
Get down, Sire.

1121
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:50,149
Home run.

1122
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:52,149
Is it me, Mario?

1123
01:47:52,149 --> 01:47:54,149
I want to talk to you about drugs.

1124
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:18,789
It's me, Mario.

1125
01:48:18,789 --> 01:48:25,569
Oh my God.

1126
01:48:31,029 --> 01:48:38,579
You are a real piece of work.

1127
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,880
Did you see what I got to deal with back there?

1128
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,880
I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal with it.

1129
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,920
I'm not going to deal with it, you are.

1130
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,920
Yes, yes.

1131
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,920
Kill him.

1132
01:48:50,920 --> 01:49:10,489
Oh Jesus.

1133
01:49:10,489 --> 01:49:49,399
Turn for the twisted.

1134
01:49:49,399 --> 01:49:51,399
Oh my God, am I a good Spider-Man?

1135
01:49:53,399 --> 01:49:56,279
Let me fucking tell you.

1136
01:49:56,279 --> 01:50:01,130
Peter Parker's here.

1137
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:03,130
You're out of your goddamn mind.

1138
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:10,939
Green Goblin.

1139
01:50:10,939 --> 01:50:14,970
Gotcha.

1140
01:50:14,970 --> 01:50:17,979
That's not Green Goblin.

1141
01:50:17,979 --> 01:50:25,789
Who's that new man?

1142
01:50:25,829 --> 01:50:27,829
This is all in your head, you're sick.

1143
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:30,130
Twisted.

1144
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:32,689
Aesthetic psychopath.

1145
01:50:32,689 --> 01:50:34,689
Activate laser sight.

1146
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:42,500
I'm wasting my time.

1147
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:47,250
What is this from?

1148
01:50:47,250 --> 01:50:49,250
New man.

1149
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:51,250
Can't I just put on a different costume?

1150
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,250
I can be Mothboy.

1151
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:08,770
See you later, man.

1152
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:10,810
Oh, that was ridiculous.

1153
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:21,039
Thing.

1154
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:23,039
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.

1155
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:25,039
And let me tell you something about Saul Goodman.

1156
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:27,039
Did you know that you have rights?

1157
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:29,039
And so do I, Albuquerque.

1158
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:31,039
I'm here to fight for you and to fight for your rights

1159
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:33,039
and fight for you in a court of law.

1160
01:51:33,039 --> 01:51:35,039
Give me a call.

1161
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:37,039
Better call Saul.

1162
01:51:37,039 --> 01:51:39,899
Better call Saul Goodman.

1163
01:51:39,899 --> 01:51:42,720
Close enough.

1164
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,720
Oh yes.

1165
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:46,720
I'm sounding like Cookie Monster.

1166
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,760
I'm doing Cookie Monster, not in Mario Kart.

1167
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,760
Reset.

1168
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,760
I'm glad so many people

1169
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:54,760
used the Mario Kart stuff.

1170
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,760
Oh, just here I go.

1171
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:59,000
I'm Cookie.

1172
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:05,590
Cookie.

1173
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:13,840
Let's see if you can deal with this.

1174
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:24,100
Hi, ladies and gentlemen.

1175
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:26,529
I'm Super Mario.

1176
01:52:26,529 --> 01:52:28,529
We've made a lot of jokes here today.

1177
01:52:28,529 --> 01:52:30,529
We've had a lot of fun.

1178
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:32,880
My head.

1179
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,880
What did they do to my head?

1180
01:53:00,529 --> 01:53:02,529
This VHS is so scuff.

1181
01:53:07,949 --> 01:53:09,949
The music ones are awesome.

1182
01:53:09,949 --> 01:53:11,949
The reason why the music ones are so good

1183
01:53:11,949 --> 01:53:16,560
is because they're kind of a nice interlude

1184
01:53:16,560 --> 01:55:24,600
between the insanity.

1185
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,840
They're nice.

1186
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,840
All right.

1187
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:30,840
Let's catch our breath a little.

1188
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:34,170
That was awesome.

1189
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:40,109
Speaking of catching our breath a little,

1190
01:55:40,109 --> 01:55:42,350
after this one,

1191
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:44,350
we're going to take a break.

1192
01:55:44,350 --> 01:55:46,350
I'm going to go pee, get into the water

1193
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:48,590
and we will do the second half.

1194
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:51,899
Let's watch this one.

1195
01:55:51,939 --> 01:56:10,420
Yeah.

1196
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:19,279
Why am I spinning around?

1197
01:56:19,279 --> 01:56:21,279
Dude, I got it. I got it.

1198
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:23,460
Hey, coffee. Coffee.

1199
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,640
Anyone want some coffee? Coffee.

1200
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,640
I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.

1201
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:29,640
Hey, coffee.

1202
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,640
Hey, who wants coffee?

1203
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,640
I got a fresh pot of coffee.

1204
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:56,920
Whoa.

1205
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,960
Whoa.

1206
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:03,050
Whoa.

1207
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,770
All right.

1208
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:12,079
Let's take a break. I'll be right back.

1209
01:57:12,079 --> 01:57:15,659
Go refill your water or whatever else you're drinking.

1210
01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:18,920
We'll be back in like two, three minutes

1211
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:22,890
and we'll start Derma Goes to the Bar.

1212
01:57:22,890 --> 02:02:11,020
See you in a minute. I have returned.

1213
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:16,439
Hello.

1214
02:02:16,439 --> 02:02:22,460
I'm going to pick up right where you left off.

1215
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:25,279
Derma Goes to the Bar. Are you guys ready?

1216
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:35,949
Are we good to go? Okay.

1217
02:02:35,949 --> 02:02:41,689
Give everybody some time to come back.

1218
02:02:41,729 --> 02:02:44,229
Three, two, one, let's go.

1219
02:02:46,659 --> 02:02:55,729
That was terrible.

1220
02:02:55,729 --> 02:03:01,359
Absolutely terrible.

1221
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:03,539
Oh my god.

1222
02:03:03,539 --> 02:03:07,000
Fucking god. Terrible.

1223
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Hey, what's up, bro? How are you doing?

1224
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Coffee.

1225
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Fucking weirdo? What?

1226
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I'm blue.

1227
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Why would you do any of that shit?

1228
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
You're a fucking idiot if you think that I can do that.

1229
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Fuck you, man.

1230
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:28,760
How do you get mad at Minecraft?

1231
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,800
Most people order their fucking coffee.

1232
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:37,329
Usually people order milk.

1233
02:03:37,329 --> 02:03:40,470
Hey, wait.

1234
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:42,470
They can't even hear me.

1235
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:44,470
Hey, everybody.

1236
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:46,770
Everybody, look over here.

1237
02:03:46,770 --> 02:03:48,770
Hey, you. Wait.

1238
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:49,770
Look.

1239
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:53,609
No, I ain't going to do it. No.

1240
02:03:53,609 --> 02:03:59,159
Hey, two, three.

1241
02:03:59,159 --> 02:04:02,239
Yeah.

1242
02:04:02,239 --> 02:04:04,239
What the fuck is that?

1243
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:06,920
And when I say let's play,

1244
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,920
I use that term pretty loosely.

1245
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:15,239
Hey, chummies.

1246
02:04:15,279 --> 02:04:19,359
So you're telling me this guy comes here every week?

1247
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:21,359
That person's a fucking weird person.

1248
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:23,359
Let's live in it.

1249
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:26,560
I've got my money.

1250
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,560
Let's spend it all.

1251
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,560
Onion ring. I've got an onion ring.

1252
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,560
What a psycho.

1253
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,560
Damn.

1254
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:35,560
Absolute perfection.

1255
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:38,119
No ifs, ands, or buts.

1256
02:04:38,119 --> 02:04:40,550
This fight here

1257
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:42,550
is absolute perfection.

1258
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:57,329
That was fucking awesome.

1259
02:04:57,369 --> 02:05:00,619
If Dermot was saw,

1260
02:05:00,619 --> 02:05:03,859
gas fit with video, apparently.

1261
02:05:03,859 --> 02:05:06,420
Okay, I'm interested.

1262
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:26,590
Now, I know how much you don't like smelly smells.

1263
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:29,020
I know how much you think it's disgusting.

1264
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:31,020
Beetles and bugs, you were a child.

1265
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:35,039
Now you must,

1266
02:05:35,039 --> 02:05:37,659
because if you cannot be in this room

1267
02:05:37,659 --> 02:05:39,659
for more than one minute,

1268
02:05:39,659 --> 02:05:42,659
gas, gas, gas, the gas will start flowing.

1269
02:05:42,659 --> 02:05:44,659
Only after you puke, though.

1270
02:05:44,659 --> 02:05:46,659
I gotta make that really clear.

1271
02:05:46,659 --> 02:05:48,659
I've been talking for a while.

1272
02:05:48,699 --> 02:05:50,699
If you puke in that toilet,

1273
02:05:50,699 --> 02:05:52,699
gas will fill the room.

1274
02:05:52,699 --> 02:05:53,699
Gas.

1275
02:05:53,699 --> 02:05:54,699
What?

1276
02:05:54,699 --> 02:05:56,699
Gas will fill the room.

1277
02:05:56,699 --> 02:05:59,199
Make your choice.

1278
02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:01,199
Will you stand the smelly smells

1279
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,199
for ten minutes,

1280
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:05,199
or will you puke into the toilet?

1281
02:06:05,199 --> 02:06:07,199
Fill the room with gas.

1282
02:06:07,199 --> 02:06:09,199
Gas fill the room with gas.

1283
02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:11,199
Gas fill the room with gas.

1284
02:06:11,199 --> 02:06:13,199
Gas.

1285
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:15,199
Make your choice.

1286
02:06:15,199 --> 02:06:21,920
Adventure to 7-Eleven.

1287
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:43,970
Hey, who wants coffee?

1288
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:44,970
Hmm.

1289
02:06:44,970 --> 02:06:45,970
Guy got coffee.

1290
02:06:45,970 --> 02:06:46,970
I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.

1291
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:47,970
Fresh pot.

1292
02:06:47,970 --> 02:06:48,970
You want coffee?

1293
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:50,970
I just got a fresh pot of coffee.

1294
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:51,970
You want coffee?

1295
02:06:51,970 --> 02:06:54,399
Coffee.

1296
02:06:54,399 --> 02:07:02,300
Those are the best.

1297
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:11,689
Ah, that hurts a little.

1298
02:07:11,689 --> 02:07:16,170
That's supposed to feel like that?

1299
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:17,670
It feels...

1300
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:19,609
My whole face hurts.

1301
02:07:19,609 --> 02:07:20,609
My face is burning.

1302
02:07:20,609 --> 02:07:23,729
That burns a lot.

1303
02:07:23,729 --> 02:07:24,729
What the...

1304
02:07:24,729 --> 02:07:26,729
What is that?

1305
02:07:26,729 --> 02:07:29,359
And...

1306
02:07:29,359 --> 02:07:32,680
I feel actually alright.

1307
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:33,720
I feel warm.

1308
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:35,720
I feel really warm, though.

1309
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:40,229
What the hell?

1310
02:07:40,229 --> 02:07:41,229
What was that?

1311
02:07:41,229 --> 02:07:42,399
What was that?

1312
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:45,409
What was that?

1313
02:07:45,409 --> 02:07:47,409
I'm going to lie down.

1314
02:07:47,409 --> 02:07:49,409
I don't know who gave it to me.

1315
02:07:49,409 --> 02:07:52,359
Why am I blue?

1316
02:07:52,359 --> 02:08:08,569
Is this all you have?

1317
02:08:08,569 --> 02:08:09,569
No.

1318
02:08:09,569 --> 02:08:11,569
You got another card back there.

1319
02:08:11,569 --> 02:08:15,520
You're going to have to bring it in.

1320
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:16,520
See, that's it?

1321
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:17,520
Yes.

1322
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:18,520
How much?

1323
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,520
That's $49.

1324
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:23,149
Put the card in.

1325
02:08:23,149 --> 02:08:25,149
It goes the other way.

1326
02:08:25,189 --> 02:08:27,189
The card reader, it goes the other way.

1327
02:08:27,189 --> 02:08:29,189
You have a chip on it, right?

1328
02:08:29,189 --> 02:08:31,189
The chip goes chip-facing it.

1329
02:08:31,189 --> 02:08:34,430
How many stores have you been to in your whole life

1330
02:08:34,430 --> 02:08:37,430
that you don't know the chip goes the other way?

1331
02:08:42,979 --> 02:08:45,989
Peter and Harry?

1332
02:08:45,989 --> 02:08:51,260
I'm going to put some dirt in your eye.

1333
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:57,829
Sire says that you're in big trouble, Harry.

1334
02:08:57,829 --> 02:09:01,159
Oh, yes.

1335
02:09:01,159 --> 02:09:03,159
Of course.

1336
02:09:03,159 --> 02:09:05,520
Oh, he's very angry.

1337
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:07,560
Sire, Sire.

1338
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:17,770
That was awesome.

1339
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:20,909
Pat, pass me the saw, please.

1340
02:09:20,909 --> 02:09:25,840
What's worse than this, my enemy

1341
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:28,079
Swear to the sympathy

1342
02:09:28,079 --> 02:09:30,079
Every devil worse than this, my enemy

1343
02:09:30,079 --> 02:09:32,079
My enemy

1344
02:09:32,079 --> 02:09:34,079
My enemy

1345
02:09:34,079 --> 02:09:36,079
No, no, no.

1346
02:09:36,079 --> 02:09:44,060
What?

1347
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:46,939
What the fuck?

1348
02:09:46,939 --> 02:09:48,939
I love this card coming up here.

1349
02:09:48,939 --> 02:09:59,239
I chop you into me, liar.

1350
02:09:59,239 --> 02:10:23,760
That was awesome.

1351
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:26,800
Wait, there's another Truman Show?

1352
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:31,909
Edit?

1353
02:10:31,909 --> 02:10:37,010
Those last two were awesome.

1354
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:39,010
Here comes Jerma in the Truman Show.

1355
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:41,010
I don't know if this is related.

02:39:32,770 --> 02:39:39,250
oh was that not a bad opinion but a part of me almost felt like some of the scenes

1512
02:39:39,250 --> 02:39:43,569
in the new spider-man movie like the director was just going to start walking around on the set

1513
02:39:43,889 --> 02:39:46,959
hey run

1514
02:39:58,979 --> 02:40:04,500
and by the way spider-man

1515
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:35,239
the deal is not on the table anymore yes it's a me mario let me tell you something if somebody

1516
02:40:35,319 --> 02:40:44,040
want to tell you to take drugs always say no you say luigi try to drink and do drugs one time

1517
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:47,479

1518
02:40:53,319 --> 02:41:04,260
peter parker's here all right hold on i need people are saying what the fuck what's that

1519
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:12,399

1520
02:41:12,399 --> 02:41:19,639
night live sketch like if i was waiting for the audience to laugh with like a laugh track i'm

1521
02:41:19,639 --> 02:41:24,360

1523
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:37,059
but i like i almost felt like i mean maybe i said this before but i'll say it again it felt like

1524
02:41:37,059 --> 02:41:42,100
at some points in that movie they were going to look into the camera like jim from the office

1525
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:46,260
like it would have actually made more sense to me if like toby maguire sometimes just kind of

1526
02:41:46,260 --> 02:41:55,329
looked in the camera like yeah i thought the movie was fine i like the first two better i like the

1527
02:41:55,329 --> 02:42:07,799
first one probably the best the first one as in of that trilogy right nice reddit taste i'm it's

1528
02:42:07,799 --> 02:42:17,250
just my opinion okay but i just i it took me out of the movie a few times i think you're wrong so

1529
02:42:17,889 --> 02:42:25,440
that's all right you you are free look i like the venom movie okay i watched the venom movie and

03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:55,819
No, I ain't gonna scream.

1656
03:07:55,819 --> 03:07:56,819
You're a man.

1657
03:07:56,819 --> 03:07:57,819
You travel.

1658
03:07:57,819 --> 03:07:58,819
You fish.

1659
03:07:58,819 --> 03:07:59,819
You survive.

1660
03:07:59,819 --> 03:08:00,819
You're a man.

1661
03:08:00,819 --> 03:08:01,819
I'm a man.

1662
03:08:01,819 --> 03:08:04,139
You're a man.

1663
03:08:04,139 --> 03:08:06,600
I'm a man.

1664
03:08:06,600 --> 03:08:22,040
You travel, you fish, you survive, you fight, you conquer, you don't let anything get in your way,

1665
03:08:26,520 --> 03:08:38,709
Ford, because you're a man. Here's another, another scary one. This one's going to be scary.

1666
03:08:38,709 --> 03:09:18,620
This guy's sexy. Oh, hi. Hey. I'm new in the neighborhood. It's nice to meet you. I

1667
03:09:18,940 --> 03:09:25,579
have a really nice house. Thank you. Yeah. I'd love to come in. Could I come in? Could I come in

1668
03:09:25,579 --> 03:09:30,940
your house? I'm sorry. I don't. I'm new in the neighborhood. My family just moved in down the

1669
03:09:30,940 --> 03:09:37,299
street. Yeah. And I just was trying to meet the neighbors. I mean, I just trying to meet the

1670
03:09:37,299 --> 03:09:47,530
neighbors. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. But like, I don't know you. I mean, yeah. That like breathe in.

1671
03:09:47,530 --> 03:09:52,340
I love what you did with the yard, by the way, that beautiful grass,

1672
03:09:52,979 --> 03:09:57,940
the grass looks beautiful. How do you get up that long? I don't know if you give some pointers.

1673
03:10:01,450 --> 03:10:04,010
You can't come in my house. Can I come in your house? You've been here for an hour.

1674
03:10:05,030 --> 03:10:09,829
No, no. You dance inside my house every day. All right. Call me if you want to talk. Call me.

1675
03:10:10,549 --> 03:10:21,209
I don't have your number. Can I come in? No, I'll wait here until I can. No, it's all good.

1676
03:10:21,209 --> 03:10:39,430
Don't worry about it. No, I barely sleep. What the fuck? Do you like drugs? I've got a lot.

1677
03:10:39,430 --> 03:10:47,559
Just let me in your house and I'll give you whatever you want. Bleed. Coke. That's all I got.

1678
03:10:47,559 --> 03:10:56,840
I don't got anything else. But you know, call me. Let me in your house. Let me in your house.

1679
03:10:56,840 --> 03:11:41,350
Let me in your house. Jesus Christ. Can I take a bite and will you guys get over this?

1680
03:11:41,989 --> 03:12:01,850
If I take a bite of this, will you get over it? Not as bad as I thought it was going to be.

1681
03:12:02,729 --> 03:12:24,149
It tastes kind of like shit though. Wait a minute. Got it back. All right, folks, take your seats.

1682
03:12:24,149 --> 03:12:32,409
We're going to be starting here in just a moment. We're going to be running a quick audio test and

1683
03:12:32,409 --> 03:12:43,719
then the show will begin shortly. All right. Ready? This is an audio test. What's up? Audio test.

1684
03:12:44,440 --> 03:12:49,319
Testing the audio. I'm going to scream. So turn down your volume. I'm being dead serious.

1685
03:12:51,479 --> 03:12:57,379
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That was probably horrible. I just got these microphones

1686
03:12:57,379 --> 03:13:06,520
like a day ago. My apologies to everyone. We have no idea who that guy was. I'm sure we'll get that

1687
03:13:06,520 --> 03:13:17,620
sorted. Our first performers of the night are the Banana Bros. Dirty. Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

1688
03:13:17,620 --> 03:13:22,729
Thank you. Thanks for coming out. Yeah. We got a new song that we're going to play. I learned this

1689
03:13:22,729 --> 03:13:30,659
one when I was traveling abroad, right? All right. Yeah. We're going to play a new song. This

1690
03:13:30,659 --> 03:13:36,090
one is something we've been working on for a long time. It doesn't have a name. It's currently

1691
03:13:36,090 --> 03:13:42,549
untitled. So that's what we're going to do. It's an untitled song and I hope you can help us come up

1692
03:13:42,549 --> 03:13:48,020
with the title at the end of the show. It's going to be peppy. It's going to be a lot of upbeat. So

1693
03:13:48,020 --> 03:13:55,719
hopefully see somebody out there dancing. Okay. And a one, two, one, two, three, four.

1694
03:13:55,719 --> 03:14:10,870
Oh,

1695
03:14:39,860 --> 03:14:43,219
sounds like before a band, a orchestra starts playing.

1696
03:14:43,219 --> 03:15:05,579
Last one. Don't thank yourself. No, that's broken up. We've been working on it for like what?

1697
03:15:05,579 --> 03:15:12,950
Two weeks, three weeks now. Yeah. John, John came up with the lyrics. What the fuck?

1698
03:15:17,819 --> 03:15:23,500
On September 22nd, 2007, the Albertson three were planning to perform at the Sus Grill,

1699
03:15:23,500 --> 03:15:27,579
a local bar in Conchester. It was also on this night that they decided to film all their

1700
03:15:27,579 --> 03:15:32,860
performances, having the Albertson three also in this compilation. What you're about to watch now

1701
03:15:32,860 --> 03:15:40,010
is the real tape of the performance. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thanks for coming out.

1702
03:15:40,010 --> 03:15:45,450
We got a new song that we're going to play for you here. A new song for context. It was the previous

1703
03:15:45,450 --> 03:15:51,110
year where they released their commercially failed album in the dollhouse. So hearing new music come

1704
03:15:51,110 --> 03:15:56,149
out is exciting for some of the people in the crowd. I hope you all enjoy it. It doesn't have a

1705
03:15:56,149 --> 03:16:01,260
name. It's currently untitled, so that's what we're going to do. It's an untitled song and I

1706
03:16:01,260 --> 03:16:05,579
hope you enjoy it. Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show. Another

1707
03:16:05,579 --> 03:16:11,750
thing the crowd noted was the absence of the lead singer, Jeremy, making only two on stage. However,

1708
03:16:11,750 --> 03:16:16,629
in a Twitter post from earlier that day, it was confirmed he wouldn't be coming down due to sickness.

1709
03:16:16,629 --> 03:16:25,030
And so the two instrumental team would shortly begin. And a one, two, one, two, three, four.

1710
03:16:27,370 --> 03:16:34,090
It was terrible. The crowd was so very shocked by what they were hearing right now. Not real music.

1711
03:16:48,709 --> 03:16:52,629
It was time for them to get off the stage, but not before doing this.

1712
03:16:53,979 --> 03:17:01,799
Thank you. Jeremiah was struck over the head by Jeremy's guitar. Crowd goers were obviously

1713
03:17:01,879 --> 03:17:06,520
frightened by this altercation. And now you could see an unconscious Jeremiah

1714
03:17:06,520 --> 03:17:15,059
laying on the floor as the cameras are shut off. And the interviews would begin.

1715
03:17:17,059 --> 03:17:23,940
I was in the chair. I was in there. I was five, 10 minutes straight. Just add the TikTok UI

1716
03:17:23,940 --> 03:17:30,780
to that whole thing and it'll be a 10 out of 10. It'll be a literal 10 out of 10 and add music to

1717
03:17:30,780 --> 03:17:35,319
it. I'm coming for you. You're the one I'm going to get. Are you coming back to this grill? No.

1718
03:17:35,319 --> 03:17:42,329
Okay. What if you would? No. What if you were offered a free? No, absolutely not. Okay. No,

1719
03:17:42,329 --> 03:17:46,729
I ain't going to do it. All right. No, sorry. How much did you have to pay to get in? $12.

1720
03:17:47,450 --> 03:17:57,989
$12. That's right. Wow. All right. I'm assuming you really enjoyed that offer of $12. That's

1721
03:17:57,989 --> 03:18:03,750
equivalent to like a pack of cigarettes. $12. That costs way, way less than that. Really?

1722
03:18:05,190 --> 03:18:08,950
Even the manager of the Albertson three came out to get an interview.

1723
03:18:08,950 --> 03:18:13,739
You deal with this. I'm not dealing with that. I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal

1724
03:18:13,739 --> 03:18:18,620
with it. You are. And in the matter of a day, the Albertson three were absolutely abolished.

1725
03:18:22,780 --> 03:18:31,899
That was crazy. That was a good one. There's been so many good ones that like, it's hard to even say

1726
03:18:31,899 --> 03:18:37,739
that was a good one, right? That was a great one among great ones. It's hard to even decide,

1727
03:18:37,739 --> 03:18:43,780
like what's a great one. They're all great. It's crazy. The quality of the submissions

1728
03:18:43,780 --> 03:18:55,299
has been just too high. It's been so high. All right. This is a Derma Combat.

1729
03:18:55,299 --> 03:19:02,459
It's warping time. Huh. We're supposed to be discovering fire. This is inappropriate.

1730
03:19:02,459 --> 03:19:31,879
Oh, that was the good one. I'm not scared though. Are you scared? Yeah, I bet you are.

1731
03:19:31,879 --> 03:19:43,350
I bet you're scared. I'm not scared at all. Hey, you can see the whole park from here. Can you see?

1732
03:19:44,149 --> 03:20:04,360
This is really high. Every wooden roller coaster.

1733
03:20:12,920 --> 03:20:19,959
Yeah. Or do you were talking about me and my kingdom? Just a little too, a little too harsh.

1734
03:20:19,959 --> 03:20:23,959
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I hear. Shut up. You want a duel? Shut up. You and me.

1735
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:29,479
Dragon bone steel. Shut up. With whatever you have there. Whatever that is. What's that again?

1736
03:20:31,430 --> 03:20:36,309
Stainless steel. Yeah. We all know how, we all know how sturdy that is. Shut the fuck up.

1737
03:20:37,350 --> 03:20:41,989
Why don't you come over this way? Let's see. Shut up. Come on. I have the power of God and anime on my

1738
03:20:41,989 --> 03:21:21,670
side. Oh my God. Let's go. We can't just stand here all day and do it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Look at

1739
03:21:21,670 --> 03:21:35,190
me. Look at me right now. Yeah. Duel of the DMCA. I mean, it's DMCA. We're trying to avoid it,

1740
03:21:35,190 --> 03:21:41,659
but you know, the VOD for these two streams are just probably not even going to be available

1741
03:21:41,659 --> 03:21:46,250
anywhere. It's going to be really hard. I know that there's a, the archive channel is working on,

1742
03:21:46,250 --> 03:21:56,280
has worked on it, but you know, it's tricky. It's tricky with the amount of copywritten material.

1743
03:21:56,280 --> 03:22:24,409
We continue. Jerma watches TV. I see something horrible. Come closer. A dire thing will happen

1744
03:22:24,409 --> 03:22:32,790
to you. He will spill your water on the table and it will drip, drip, drip over the edge down to

1745
03:22:32,790 --> 03:22:39,879
the ground. Next weekend, you're going to get invited to a party on Facebook. You're going to

1746
03:22:39,959 --> 03:22:45,610
say maybe, and you're going to be kind of excited to go, but they're going to cancel.

1747
03:22:46,409 --> 03:22:53,129
They're going to cancel it. Oh, yup. That one is bad. Hot, hot, hot.

1748
03:23:02,920 --> 03:23:10,020
Something that's not completely biafoo. Drugs and alcohol. Hi everybody. I'm the actor that plays

1749
03:23:10,020 --> 03:23:47,530
Super Mario and I just be on your best behavior. Be on your best behavior. Yeah. Yeah. I'm up.

1750
03:24:01,190 --> 03:24:15,559
I don't know. What's the context of this one? This is okay. This is literally just a shitty

1751
03:24:16,280 --> 03:24:44,860
that somebody got last second from a bag. This is going to be fucking loud. Damn. That was awesome.

1752
03:24:45,420 --> 03:24:56,040
Yes, I, of course, as you enter the dark woods, you come across three goblins.

1753
03:24:57,270 --> 03:25:10,809
Roll for initiative and put your miniatures down. You are not going to go by me more.

1754
03:25:10,809 --> 03:25:14,889
You're first. What do you do? My wizard cast fireball on the one on the left.

1755
03:25:16,790 --> 03:25:33,719
Nice job. Vinny, your turn. I shoot the one in the middle. Roll to hit. Shit. Natural one.

1756
03:25:36,329 --> 03:25:45,690
Ow. Jerma, your go. I hit with my sword.

1757
03:25:56,729 --> 03:26:07,829
Okay. Nice job. Now it's the goblin's turn. It will try to hit Jerma. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

1758
03:26:09,100 --> 03:26:22,549
Oh, critical hit. I'm sorry, Jerma. It kills you. Mark back to you. Wait, where are the miniatures?

1759
03:26:24,899 --> 03:26:32,329
What the fuck? Okay. That took me to almost the end of the video to realize that those were AI

1760
03:26:32,329 --> 03:26:37,299
voices, especially criticals. I thought I thought critical did a thing where he did like a D and D

1761
03:26:37,299 --> 03:27:00,629
thing. I was that that that was convincing. Wow. That's insane. Guess what? Very much unhappy.

1762
03:27:00,629 --> 03:27:14,809
No, really. I don't want you to guess. You do shut up. What? Shut up. I know for a fact. Shut

1763
03:27:14,809 --> 03:27:19,770
the fuck up. I'm sorry. Please don't speak to me like that. I'm simply saying shut the fuck up.

1764
03:27:19,770 --> 03:27:27,049
Shut up. Shut up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I hear. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

1765
03:27:27,049 --> 03:27:34,520
Shut up. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shut the fuck

1766
03:27:34,520 --> 03:27:56,139
up. Shut up. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut up. What the fuck? My name is. My name was not Borden, actually.

1767
03:27:58,340 --> 03:28:04,700
I want to make this video really quickly to say.

1768
03:28:08,299 --> 03:28:13,979
I have to do a drug BSA. Okay. Let me tell you something about drugs.

1769
03:28:15,260 --> 03:28:22,299
Try to pressure to do drugs one time. And I said, No, you should never take any drugs. Never.

1770
03:28:22,620 --> 03:28:34,139
What is going on? Toad, stay away from them. If somebody tries to pressure you into drinking or

1771
03:28:34,139 --> 03:28:42,649
smoking, tell them with the hardest of hearts. No, I don't need to do that. We can get back to

1772
03:28:42,649 --> 03:28:52,709
the playing and games now. Let me check and see. I think we're getting down to the end here, I think.

1773
03:28:53,940 --> 03:29:05,340
Let me check to see. We have. Okay. We're getting down to the final 25 videos. There are 25 videos

1774
03:29:05,420 --> 03:29:25,860
left. Just so you know, we're down to 25. Hold on. Let me get this over here.

1775
03:29:25,860 --> 03:29:34,229
Okay. Here we go. Final 25 videos. Let's go. What is this? Spider-Man.

1776
03:30:51,579 --> 03:30:58,489
You need to go and close them all before the knock on the door of your mother finds you.

1777
03:30:58,489 --> 03:32:12,280
You have one minute. Make your choice. First, this one over here. Oh, no. That was good.

1778
03:32:19,690 --> 03:32:27,670
What was that? What was that? Hold on. What was that one? What the fuck was that?

1779
03:32:29,030 --> 03:32:31,590
I'm actually so confused. Was that part of a different video?

1780
03:32:31,590 --> 03:32:39,379
Oh, okay.

1781
03:33:04,010 --> 03:33:05,690
My first Mario Kart win.

1782
03:33:40,139 --> 03:33:43,079
It's so stupid.

1783
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:37,719
This level sucks.

1784
03:35:11,059 --> 03:35:22,600
That level is such a piece of shit. Seriously. And the music is just.

1785
03:35:29,989 --> 03:36:01,979
Behind. Don't say it. Don't say it. Behind. Come on. Behind. Behind.

1786
03:36:04,219 --> 03:36:34,459
Slow ahead. I can go slower ahead. Come on down and chomp some of this shit. Behind. Behind.

1787
03:36:35,100 --> 03:36:55,690
I said leave. I don't even know where half of these movies are. Behind. Behind. Behind. Behind.

1788
03:37:08,920 --> 03:37:24,020
What the fuck? Play for now. Okay. What's up? I fucking quit the goddamn game. I exited the

1789
03:37:24,020 --> 03:37:31,399
fucking game. No, I didn't. I'm still in. Close the door. All right. I'm good. I can't believe I

1790
03:37:31,399 --> 03:37:38,360
actually played this. Are you still there? What the fuck are you still doing here? You dick.

1791
03:37:45,739 --> 03:37:46,700
What the fuck is happening?

1792
03:39:28,379 --> 03:40:35,290
What am I saying? Air to the what?

1793
03:40:48,540 --> 03:40:57,190
Air to the. Air to the what? Air to the. Air to the. Air to the. There's something wrong with

1794
03:40:57,190 --> 03:41:03,319
your fan's brains. Why are you saying that? That was like incredibly well done detailed and the

1795
03:41:03,319 --> 03:41:10,020
music. It was. It flowed perfectly. What are you talking about? All right, ladies and gentlemen.

1796
03:41:10,020 --> 03:41:24,500
Let me check. We are getting down. Oh, there are about 15 or so left. We're getting to the final

1797
03:41:24,500 --> 03:41:39,219
15. Ever. Well, not ever, but you know, for today. Oh, yes. I love the MasterChef ones.

1798
03:41:39,219 --> 03:42:00,389
Hey, Bob. Hey, Bob. I'm on TV. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can I have the mic? No, you don't have to

1799
03:42:00,389 --> 03:42:07,959
give it to me. I'm on TV, Ma. I'm on TV. Jammer. Yes, Chef. Stay there for a minute. Yeah, I'm

1800
03:42:07,959 --> 03:42:14,280
currently trying to make sure that I have enough of the seasoning on here. Just step back. Look

1801
03:42:14,280 --> 03:42:21,530
at the mess. But it takes up so much less space. It's not in one space. It's from there all the

1802
03:42:21,530 --> 03:42:25,930
way down and all over the place. Look at the cupboard. This takes. Let me tell you one more

1803
03:42:25,930 --> 03:42:32,329
thing. If you were in any of our kitchens, you'd been fired six months ago. Dude, I looked over here

1804
03:42:32,329 --> 03:42:38,329
and it's a mess over here. There's like 75 items over here and then I'm looking over here.

1805
03:42:39,290 --> 03:42:44,809
There's a door right there and there's a big exit sign. I'm just looking back and forth like,

1806
03:42:46,250 --> 03:42:59,020
oh, me. That is a disaster. What is that? What it made for you today is I have

1807
03:42:59,260 --> 03:43:06,059
a creamy mushroom risotto and a side of creamy broccoli risotto with a hint, a small portion

1808
03:43:06,059 --> 03:43:11,500
of a creamy chicken risotto. And then on the side of that, I also have two pork chops that

1809
03:43:11,500 --> 03:43:15,500
I have created and I seared to perfection and then finished off. And it's served on a

1810
03:43:15,500 --> 03:43:26,649
bed of raw flour, right? Yes, Chef. I actually just had it before you did. I just had some before you

1811
03:43:26,649 --> 03:43:29,290
did.

1812
03:43:38,280 --> 03:43:42,280
What do you mean it's not good? It's a perfect risotto. It's perfect.

1813
03:43:47,500 --> 03:43:53,219
You work in a mess, you produce a mess. I'm struggling to identify what the hell you're

1814
03:43:53,219 --> 03:44:01,209
doing. I really am. You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.

1815
03:44:01,209 --> 03:44:06,489
You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows. You're just a mean guy that got a bunch

1816
03:44:06,489 --> 03:44:13,370
of TV shows and I'm not going to stand for it. How about enough? I've had enough. I'm not leaving.

1817
03:44:13,370 --> 03:44:27,899
No, I think I deserve to win. Get out! Out! I f*** this competition. I don't care.

1818
03:44:27,899 --> 03:44:41,190
Dude, somebody in the chat was saying, why would somebody make a risotto pizza?

1819
03:44:41,190 --> 03:44:52,069
A risotto pizza omega lul. That just kept popping in my head and just doing it.

1820
03:44:52,069 --> 03:45:00,819
Let's go! I'm killing you. I'm killing you. And here I come!

1821
03:45:02,340 --> 03:45:09,100
I'm going to smash your f***ing head with a mallet like Gallagher used to.

1822
03:45:09,100 --> 03:45:21,639
You big b***h, I'll put you in a meat grinder!

1823
03:45:27,219 --> 03:45:36,250
Life is pain! I hate-

1824
03:45:36,250 --> 03:45:38,250
That game was awesome. It was really hard though.

1825
03:45:38,889 --> 03:45:53,450
Okie dokie! Nice!

1826
03:45:54,170 --> 03:46:09,319
F*** out of here! F*** down!

1827
03:46:18,920 --> 03:46:19,639
That's awesome.

1828
03:46:26,229 --> 03:46:28,809
Damn! Sentry, going up!

1829
03:46:29,829 --> 03:46:31,110
They changed the clothes.

1830
03:46:56,459 --> 03:46:57,420
Oh, excuse me!

1831
03:47:01,190 --> 03:47:02,229
Yabba dabba doo!

1832
03:47:02,229 --> 03:47:03,190
Look at me!

1833
03:47:03,190 --> 03:47:04,780
What do you sound like?

1834
03:47:04,780 --> 03:47:06,059
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1835
03:47:06,059 --> 03:47:10,760
Why, you motherf***er!

1836
03:47:12,889 --> 03:47:21,909
There it is. F***ing boink!

1837
03:47:33,719 --> 03:47:34,219
Damn.

1838
03:47:40,540 --> 03:47:41,420
I'm not even winded.

1839
03:47:41,899 --> 03:47:49,000
F*** Dr. MD.

1840
03:47:49,000 --> 03:47:51,979
Just got done with a quick bike ride.

1841
03:47:52,940 --> 03:47:54,860
Kickstand. Comes in.

1842
03:47:54,860 --> 03:47:57,020
Just like sweat just glistening off his forehead.

1843
03:47:58,940 --> 03:48:01,030
So, what brings you in today?

1844
03:48:02,659 --> 03:48:05,450
Well, I have a little bit of a headache.

1845
03:48:07,049 --> 03:48:10,969
It's kind of like a migraine-ass kind of deal I got going on here.

1846
03:48:11,530 --> 03:48:12,090
One second.

1847
03:48:12,889 --> 03:48:15,110
Takes the bike helmet off and just pairs.

1848
03:48:15,989 --> 03:48:18,069
It's like at least 16 to 20 inches of hair.

1849
03:48:19,909 --> 03:48:20,870
He pulls up the license.

1850
03:48:21,590 --> 03:48:25,139
60, by the way.

1851
03:48:25,139 --> 03:48:27,299
And I'm like, oh wow, look at that crazy thing!

1852
03:48:27,299 --> 03:48:28,739
That's, wow, you got, what a head of hair!

1853
03:48:29,540 --> 03:48:30,020
He's like, yeah.

1854
03:48:30,819 --> 03:48:32,979
Haven't had a headache, by the way, in a long time.

1855
03:48:32,979 --> 03:48:37,209
You want to eat some bugs?

1856
03:48:38,010 --> 03:48:46,969
Final Fantasy V?

1857
03:48:52,709 --> 03:48:55,909
We haven't seen a Slytherin mustache guy in a while.

1858
03:49:37,659 --> 03:49:38,379
Lightning hands!

1859
03:49:54,170 --> 03:49:54,889
That was awesome.

1860
03:49:55,610 --> 03:50:10,020
Hello, boys and girls!

1861
03:50:12,170 --> 03:50:18,940
Good time!

1862
03:50:26,120 --> 03:50:27,479
Suck a fart out of my ass!

1863
03:50:28,280 --> 03:51:00,200
Oh, hey, what's going on?

1864
03:51:00,200 --> 03:51:01,319
How are you doing?

1865
03:51:01,319 --> 03:51:04,409
Wait, are you summoning?

1866
03:51:04,409 --> 03:51:04,969
Watch out!

1867
03:51:23,079 --> 03:51:24,440
Oh, I thought the video froze.

1868
03:51:34,010 --> 03:51:41,909
That was awesome.

1869
03:51:41,909 --> 03:51:47,579
Hi, chefs.

1870
03:51:48,219 --> 03:51:51,260
What I made for you today is I have a creamy mushroom risotto

1871
03:51:51,899 --> 03:51:53,899
and a side of creamy broccoli risotto

1872
03:51:54,700 --> 03:51:58,299
with a hint, a small portion of a creamy chicken risotto.

1873
03:52:00,379 --> 03:52:04,920
Is that normal?

1874
03:52:06,389 --> 03:52:08,149
Amazing Bazzini's risotto.

1875
03:52:09,350 --> 03:52:10,790
Wow, that's extraordinary, no?

1876
03:52:12,100 --> 03:52:12,659
Yeah.

1877
03:52:12,659 --> 03:52:13,459
It doesn't even move.

1878
03:52:16,950 --> 03:52:17,590
Well, I mean...

1879
03:52:18,950 --> 03:52:21,430
Well, maybe that'll look better up there.

1880
03:52:23,450 --> 03:52:25,959
It fits the colors.

1881
03:52:31,379 --> 03:52:36,489
Mess.

1882
03:52:37,049 --> 03:52:39,209
And absolutely disgusting.

1883
03:52:39,209 --> 03:52:41,770
And that's what my mom taught me, you know?

1884
03:52:42,489 --> 03:52:43,690
It just tastes of mush.

1885
03:52:44,729 --> 03:52:45,370
It's not good.

1886
03:52:46,809 --> 03:52:47,770
It's just so bland.

1887
03:52:48,409 --> 03:52:50,489
Honestly, I mean, it's just greasy.

1888
03:52:50,489 --> 03:52:51,530
What do you mean it's not good?

1889
03:52:52,409 --> 03:52:53,850
It's a perfect risotto.

1890
03:52:53,850 --> 03:52:54,489
It's perfect.

1891
03:52:54,489 --> 03:52:56,809
The crap and the gunk on top of it is just hideous.

1892
03:52:56,809 --> 03:52:57,770
Perfect risotto.

1893
03:52:57,770 --> 03:52:59,930
It looks like re-fried beans.

1894
03:53:01,799 --> 03:53:03,239
You like to talk like you know food,

1895
03:53:03,239 --> 03:53:04,360
but you actually really don't.

1896
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:05,639
Unbelievable.

1897
03:53:06,360 --> 03:53:07,639
Now I know the problem.

1898
03:53:08,200 --> 03:53:11,479
You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.

1899
03:53:12,120 --> 03:53:14,280
You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.

1900
03:53:14,280 --> 03:53:16,680
And I'm not going to stand for it.

1901
03:53:16,680 --> 03:53:17,399
I'm not leaving.

1902
03:53:18,360 --> 03:53:19,319
Get out of here!

1903
03:53:19,319 --> 03:53:20,200
Right, go then!

1904
03:53:26,040 --> 03:53:29,579
Okay.

1905
03:53:29,579 --> 03:53:30,379
Melted ice cream?

1906
03:53:30,379 --> 03:53:31,579
Creamy mushroom risotto,

1907
03:53:31,579 --> 03:53:34,139
and you don't have a fucking palate to save your life,

1908
03:53:34,139 --> 03:53:35,340
you fucking idiot.

1909
03:53:36,790 --> 03:53:37,829
Yeah, why am I leaving?

1910
03:53:45,940 --> 03:53:46,819
It's so good.

1911
03:53:47,780 --> 03:53:48,579
It's so good.

1912
03:53:48,579 --> 03:53:49,299
Whatever.

1913
03:53:49,299 --> 03:53:50,579
I fucked this competition.

1914
03:53:50,579 --> 03:53:51,139
I don't care.

1915
03:53:53,000 --> 03:53:53,879
Jesus Christ.

1916
03:53:55,659 --> 03:53:57,500
All right, so people are saying,

1917
03:53:58,809 --> 03:54:01,459
why do you only know what risotto is?

1918
03:54:01,459 --> 03:54:03,379
No, but in every one of these shows

1919
03:54:03,379 --> 03:54:04,260
and every one of the competitions,

1920
03:54:04,260 --> 03:54:04,899
they're always like,

1921
03:54:04,899 --> 03:54:07,059
oh, of course I have a creamy mushroom risotto.

1922
03:54:07,059 --> 03:54:08,579
It's like they always do that.

1923
03:54:08,579 --> 03:54:11,219
It's just like the thing that they all make on every episode.

1924
03:54:11,219 --> 03:54:13,299
There's always a risotto.

1925
03:54:13,299 --> 03:54:14,579
There's always a risotto.

1926
03:54:14,579 --> 03:54:19,500
Okay, volume 985.

1927
03:54:19,500 --> 03:54:20,540
Jeremy catalog.

1928
03:54:20,540 --> 03:54:48,840
Not much.

1929
03:54:48,840 --> 03:54:49,399
How are you doing?

1930
03:54:49,399 --> 03:54:50,200
Not up and I'm just,

1931
03:54:50,200 --> 03:54:51,959
I'm curious as to why you're like the worst creamer on the planet.

1932
03:54:51,959 --> 03:54:52,680
Oh, is that what you think?

1933
03:54:52,680 --> 03:54:53,799
You think that's what you think?

1934
03:54:53,799 --> 03:54:54,520
You fucking idiot.

1935
03:54:56,520 --> 03:55:47,479
What my god.

1936
03:55:57,030 --> 03:56:20,219
We could stop at five or six different stores.

1937
03:56:20,219 --> 03:56:20,959
Just one.

1938
03:56:28,760 --> 03:56:30,360
Oh, and now we're to Mario.

1939
03:56:30,360 --> 03:56:30,920
Here we go.

1940
03:56:33,059 --> 03:56:34,579
A scary one.

1941
03:56:34,579 --> 03:56:35,620
No, it's me.

1942
03:56:35,620 --> 03:56:37,540
We're back in a fun Mario one now.

1943
03:56:58,620 --> 03:57:03,750
This game is sick by the way.

1944
03:57:03,750 --> 03:57:05,260
Mario Yahtzee.

1945
03:57:05,260 --> 03:57:15,399
Good block.

1946
03:57:15,399 --> 03:57:16,120
Perfect dodge.

1947
03:57:40,780 --> 03:57:42,299
Bowser needs to understand.

1948
03:57:42,940 --> 03:57:45,819
Boys and girls, don't do drugs.

1949
03:57:45,819 --> 03:57:46,620
If you do drugs-

1950
03:57:46,620 --> 03:57:47,420
Where are my legs?

1951
03:57:47,420 --> 03:57:50,250
You end up like kick bouncer over here.

1952
03:57:50,250 --> 03:57:50,729
Dead.

1953
03:57:50,729 --> 03:57:53,479
Where's Luigi?

1954
03:58:19,739 --> 03:58:20,860
Bowser.

1955
03:58:20,860 --> 03:58:21,819
It's a Bowser.

1956
03:58:50,090 --> 03:58:51,209
Not this fucking level.

1957
03:58:53,559 --> 03:58:55,959
No, it's me, Mario.

1958
03:58:55,959 --> 03:58:57,319
Okay, I'm done.

1959
03:58:58,040 --> 03:58:59,719
I can't, I can't do it.

1960
03:59:00,520 --> 03:59:02,680
I can't, that was it, that was the end.

1961
03:59:05,559 --> 03:59:07,700
Firm with a window cleaner.

1962
03:59:13,020 --> 03:59:16,569
Hi mom.

1963
03:59:17,290 --> 03:59:18,569
Hey mom, I'm on TV.

1964
03:59:19,770 --> 03:59:20,809
I'm on the television.

1965
03:59:21,450 --> 03:59:22,090
Channel two.

1966
03:59:22,969 --> 03:59:24,729
I'll leave, I'll leave, I'll leave but-

1967
03:59:24,729 --> 03:59:25,229
Oh, hey.

1968
03:59:26,889 --> 03:59:28,809
Hey, you can see the whole park from here, can you see?

1969
03:59:29,770 --> 03:59:30,569
That's crazy.

1970
03:59:30,569 --> 03:59:31,129
You're gonna scream.

1971
03:59:31,129 --> 03:59:33,530
I feel like I'm at an audition right now.

1972
03:59:33,530 --> 03:59:36,250
There's like three people with clipboards over there

1973
03:59:36,250 --> 03:59:38,409
and they're just like judging every word I'm saying.

1974
03:59:40,420 --> 03:59:41,059
Again?

1975
03:59:41,059 --> 03:59:41,620
Really?

1976
03:59:41,620 --> 03:59:42,739
You're gonna do this again?

1977
03:59:42,739 --> 03:59:45,780
You did this and you can fix it too, you know.

1978
03:59:45,780 --> 03:59:48,340
Words cannot even comprehend how Zaya says

1979
03:59:48,340 --> 03:59:50,100
you're about to be in very big trouble.

1980
03:59:50,100 --> 03:59:51,620
Oh, you've got a mouth on you, don't you?

1981
03:59:51,620 --> 03:59:52,739
Oh, he's very angry.

1982
03:59:53,299 --> 03:59:55,059
Zaya, Zaya, he's angry.

1983
03:59:55,059 --> 03:59:57,219
I'm coming down there and I'm gonna fuck you up.

1984
03:59:57,219 --> 03:59:58,420
Hey, come on out here because there's bugs everywhere.

1985
03:59:58,420 --> 03:59:59,620
I don't like when the bugs are everywhere.

1986
03:59:59,620 --> 04:00:01,379
Find the red truck.

1987
04:00:01,379 --> 04:00:02,100
Use your eyes.

1988
04:00:02,659 --> 04:00:03,620
Dude, is this something on me?

1989
04:00:03,620 --> 04:00:04,420
Is this something on my back?

1990
04:00:05,139 --> 04:00:06,260
Is this something on my back?

1991
04:00:06,260 --> 04:00:06,899
Just tell me, get it.

1992
04:00:06,899 --> 04:00:07,399
Zombies!

1993
04:00:08,020 --> 04:00:08,979
Get it, get it, get it.

1994
04:00:10,020 --> 04:00:11,059
Oh my god, it's huge.

1995
04:00:11,059 --> 04:00:12,100
Dude, it's huge.

1996
04:00:12,100 --> 04:00:13,139
Would you like to see the notes?

1997
04:00:13,700 --> 04:00:14,579
You can see it if you want.

1998
04:00:14,579 --> 04:00:15,940
Would you like to see what I've written down?

1999
04:00:15,940 --> 04:00:16,500
Go ahead and look.

2000
04:00:17,219 --> 04:00:18,340
Do you see what's in front of us?

2001
04:00:18,340 --> 04:00:19,139
You do, right?

2002
04:00:19,139 --> 04:00:20,659
No human drives a car like this.

2003
04:00:21,780 --> 04:00:23,459
You're not getting your license today, by the way.

2004
04:00:24,100 --> 04:00:25,139
Make that very clear.

2005
04:00:25,780 --> 04:00:34,899
Oh, damn.

2006
04:00:41,430 --> 04:00:43,430
Find the red truck.

2007
04:00:43,430 --> 04:00:44,629
All right, where are we?

2008
04:00:44,629 --> 04:00:50,280
We're down to the final.

2009
04:00:50,280 --> 04:00:52,200
Oh man, the final like seven.

2010
04:00:52,200 --> 04:00:55,620
No, there are eight.

2011
04:00:55,620 --> 04:00:56,819
There are eight remaining.

2012
04:00:56,819 --> 04:01:02,649
This one is called Lucio Malfoyle's First Lesson.

2013
04:01:02,649 --> 04:01:03,930
I wonder what it is.

2014
04:01:10,100 --> 04:01:11,139
Okay, he's all right.

2015
04:01:11,139 --> 04:01:11,780
He's fine.

2016
04:01:11,780 --> 04:01:12,340
He's fine.

2017
04:01:12,340 --> 04:01:13,780
Everyone's laughing if it's fine.

2018
04:01:26,760 --> 04:01:29,909
My name is Lucio Malfoyle.

2019
04:01:30,469 --> 04:01:32,819
I'm the new teacher in town.

2020
04:01:32,819 --> 04:01:35,219
Hey, you and me, you're evil too, right?

2021
04:01:36,340 --> 04:01:37,940
We're probably going to be really good friends.

2022
04:01:40,250 --> 04:01:44,170
If we could all open up your textbooks and go to page 200, please.

2023
04:01:45,979 --> 04:01:47,180
Yes, yes.

2024
04:01:47,180 --> 04:01:48,139
Ron, please.

2025
04:01:49,100 --> 04:01:51,020
There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.

2026
04:01:51,020 --> 04:01:54,379
Page 200, we're going to be making a frog breath potion.

2027
04:01:55,829 --> 04:01:57,590
You know all about that, don't you, Harry?

2028
04:01:58,389 --> 04:01:58,950
Hermione.

2029
04:01:58,950 --> 04:02:02,950
The one you used when you killed Lucius?

2030
04:02:02,950 --> 04:02:05,030
Isn't he Lucius?

2031
04:02:05,030 --> 04:02:05,989
Shut up, Malfoyle.

2032
04:02:10,459 --> 04:02:12,139
I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.

2033
04:02:12,139 --> 04:02:14,299
That's not the time to use that spell.

2034
04:02:14,299 --> 04:02:17,420
And how's theory supposed to prepare us for without that?

2035
04:02:17,420 --> 04:02:22,459
Didn't they ever tell you you only use that spell if you mean to kill another wizard?

2036
04:02:22,459 --> 04:02:29,350
And yes, I'm aware that your old teacher has perished.

2037
04:02:29,350 --> 04:02:30,389
Dr. McGillicuddy.

2038
04:02:30,389 --> 04:02:31,110
It was murder.

2039
04:02:31,110 --> 04:02:31,989
Voldemort killed him.

2040
04:02:32,389 --> 04:02:33,989
Now you're going to be floating in the air.

2041
04:02:38,870 --> 04:02:39,370
Down.

2042
04:02:42,010 --> 04:02:43,850
Well, class, it's been a pleasure.

2043
04:02:43,850 --> 04:02:44,889
Absolute pleasure.

2044
04:02:45,450 --> 04:02:50,010
But you all don't understand the power of the Dark Lord.

2045
04:02:50,010 --> 04:02:52,250
And for that reason, I'm out.

2046
04:02:53,049 --> 04:03:02,010
Just like that show, Shark Tank.

2047
04:03:02,010 --> 04:03:02,510
Invictus!

2048
04:03:04,489 --> 04:03:08,860
He's an idiot.

2049
04:03:10,299 --> 04:03:12,299
You're a little shit, and you always were.

2050
04:03:12,299 --> 04:03:14,940
But you didn't know, Harry, that I have lightning hands.

2051
04:03:16,760 --> 04:03:17,260
Oh!

2052
04:03:27,219 --> 04:03:29,780
You have no idea what's in store for you, Harry.

2053
04:03:29,780 --> 04:03:31,639
Me and Malfoyle are going to destroy you.

2054
04:03:34,120 --> 04:03:45,020
Scrappy stuff!

2055
04:03:48,180 --> 04:03:52,809
Oh, that was a good one.

2056
04:03:54,729 --> 04:03:55,610
That was really good.

2057
04:03:58,360 --> 04:04:00,340
Frog's Breath Potion.

2058
04:04:00,340 --> 04:04:02,420
Imagine dying to Frog's Breath Potion.

2059
04:04:02,420 --> 04:04:03,940
How would that even fucking hurt you?

2060
04:04:03,940 --> 04:04:07,690
That doesn't make any sense.

2061
04:04:07,690 --> 04:04:10,020
How would that even, how would that hurt you?

2062
04:04:10,020 --> 04:04:10,500
What is that?

2063
04:04:10,500 --> 04:04:10,979
What is that?

2064
04:04:10,979 --> 04:04:11,540
What spell is that?

2065
04:04:11,540 --> 04:04:13,610
What potion is that?

2066
04:04:13,610 --> 04:04:15,770
That killed, wow, what a terrible wizard you were.

2067
04:04:15,770 --> 04:04:17,049
What a shitty wizard.

2068
04:04:17,049 --> 04:04:19,940
You died from a frog's breath.

2069
04:04:19,940 --> 04:04:23,350
That's like the joke, cartoon, goofy part of the movie.

2070
04:04:23,350 --> 04:04:26,139
When it's like, oh, I got bad breath.

2071
04:04:26,139 --> 04:04:28,149
That killed Lucius Malfoyle.

2072
04:04:28,149 --> 04:04:29,430
What a shit wizard.

2073
04:04:29,430 --> 04:04:33,850
Okay, let's go.

2074
04:04:58,979 --> 04:05:03,590
Why don't you come here?

2075
04:05:03,590 --> 04:05:08,979
Come on, come on, do it already.

2076
04:05:08,979 --> 04:05:11,219
Let's go, because we can't just stand here all day, dude.

2077
04:05:11,219 --> 04:05:12,180
Wait, I got shit to do.

2078
04:05:12,180 --> 04:05:12,680
Come on.

2079
04:05:14,500 --> 04:05:23,059
Hey, who wants coffee?

2080
04:05:24,180 --> 04:05:25,270
Guy got coffee.

2081
04:05:25,270 --> 04:05:26,629
I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.

2082
04:05:48,680 --> 04:05:49,799
It's amazing.

2083
04:05:49,799 --> 04:05:51,500
Hold on, let's see that again.

2084
04:05:52,139 --> 04:05:53,579
I'm sorry, we have to see that again.

2085
04:06:05,379 --> 04:06:08,340
This one has flashing lights and blinking lights.

2086
04:06:08,340 --> 04:06:09,780
Flashing sounds and lights.

2087
04:06:09,780 --> 04:06:12,420
Just so you're aware.

2088
04:06:14,680 --> 04:06:18,170
Okay, this is flashing lights.

2089
04:06:18,170 --> 04:06:19,530
You ready?

2090
04:06:19,530 --> 04:06:21,850
Flashing sounds.

2091
04:06:21,850 --> 04:06:26,809
We're always striving to make you feel as comfortable as possible.

2092
04:06:26,809 --> 04:06:29,690
Which is why we have the complimentary breakfast.

2093
04:06:30,409 --> 04:06:31,610
And the pool.

2094
04:06:32,250 --> 04:06:35,370
Also, a golf course.

2095
04:06:36,170 --> 04:06:37,879
But don't take it from us.

2096
04:06:37,879 --> 04:06:38,520
This is a bunch of stock footage.

2097
04:06:38,520 --> 04:06:42,600
Take it from this testimonial from our esteemed guest.

2098
04:06:56,520 --> 04:06:58,840
Wherever life takes you, we are there.

2099
04:06:59,559 --> 04:07:00,780
Best Western.

2100
04:07:05,670 --> 04:07:06,629
What is going on?

2101
04:07:18,010 --> 04:07:28,059
Hey, I'm just hanging out.

2102
04:07:30,409 --> 04:07:31,129
Who's talking?

2103
04:07:31,930 --> 04:07:34,010
What are you up to?

2104
04:07:34,010 --> 04:07:34,889
How are you?

2105
04:07:34,889 --> 04:07:36,090
Hi, how are you?

2106
04:07:36,090 --> 04:07:36,969
Good to see you.

2107
04:07:36,969 --> 04:07:38,090
Oh, I'm clean now.

2108
04:07:38,969 --> 04:07:40,870
Clean Andy.

2109
04:07:40,870 --> 04:07:41,190
Prove it.

2110
04:07:41,190 --> 04:07:41,750
You got to prove it.

2111
04:07:42,469 --> 04:07:43,989
Okay, I'll prove it.

2112
04:07:44,809 --> 04:07:46,170
All right, I didn't tweet yet.

2113
04:07:47,209 --> 04:07:48,170
I have to send a message.

2114
04:07:49,049 --> 04:07:52,170
What I thought you were saying is pour ice down your pants.

2115
04:07:52,889 --> 04:07:54,620
Prove that I was just in the shower.

2116
04:07:54,620 --> 04:07:55,100
There it is.

2117
04:07:56,219 --> 04:07:57,340
No more face cam.

2118
04:07:57,340 --> 04:07:57,819
Not today.

2119
04:07:58,540 --> 04:08:02,299
Don't see the stupid face burned onto their thousand dollar TV.

2120
04:08:02,299 --> 04:08:03,420
What do I do?

2121
04:08:03,420 --> 04:08:06,729
My dad saw a video of yours.

2122
04:08:06,729 --> 04:08:07,530
He had a heart attack.

2123
04:08:08,170 --> 04:08:11,770
You know, no, no, we're not going down this road.

2124
04:08:12,409 --> 04:08:13,530
It's literally just a wall.

2125
04:08:13,530 --> 04:08:14,729
Dude, it's going to live a long time.

2126
04:08:14,729 --> 04:08:15,129
It might.

2127
04:08:15,690 --> 04:08:17,940
But what was the last thing I did?

2128
04:08:17,940 --> 04:08:18,659
I gave tablets.

2129
04:08:18,659 --> 04:08:19,459
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2130
04:08:19,459 --> 04:08:22,489
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

2131
04:08:22,489 --> 04:08:23,049
Good.

2132
04:08:23,049 --> 04:08:23,450
Excellent.

2133
04:08:25,540 --> 04:08:26,100
Keep the horror.

2134
04:08:26,100 --> 04:08:27,379
I don't have that image anymore.

2135
04:08:27,940 --> 04:08:31,159
There we go.

2136
04:08:31,719 --> 04:08:33,139
You want to keep the horror?

2137
04:08:33,139 --> 04:08:33,459
Here.

2138
04:08:37,020 --> 04:08:37,659
Oh, shit.

2139
04:08:57,139 --> 04:09:15,219
Holy shit.

2140
04:09:15,219 --> 04:09:17,829
That was fucking crazy.

2141
04:09:17,829 --> 04:09:22,889
That was awesome.

2142
04:09:22,889 --> 04:09:24,010
That was really good.

2143
04:09:25,989 --> 04:09:27,270
That's a clap for that one.

2144
04:09:27,270 --> 04:09:29,370
All right.

2145
04:09:29,370 --> 04:09:31,530
German 95 attempts to survive and vampire survivors.

2146
04:09:31,530 --> 04:09:32,090
Okay.

2147
04:09:32,090 --> 04:09:41,639
Are you ready?

2148
04:09:41,639 --> 04:09:45,479
Oh, that was disgusting.

2149
04:09:45,479 --> 04:09:46,360
It's warping time.

2150
04:09:52,889 --> 04:09:53,930
No, no, I'm sorry.

2151
04:09:53,930 --> 04:09:54,250
No.

2152
04:09:54,250 --> 04:10:01,059
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2153
04:10:07,129 --> 04:10:07,610
All right.

2154
04:10:08,329 --> 04:10:10,280
German 101.

2155
04:10:31,450 --> 04:10:33,180
All right.

2156
04:10:33,180 --> 04:10:33,819
That's enough.

2157
04:10:33,819 --> 04:10:34,700
That's enough.

2158
04:10:34,700 --> 04:10:45,479
You got an F and you're not going to get your license.

2159
04:10:54,020 --> 04:10:54,659
This can't be.

2160
04:10:54,659 --> 04:10:55,459
This can't be right.

2161
04:10:56,340 --> 04:11:05,100
Wait, what did that say?

2162
04:11:05,899 --> 04:11:06,700
What did that say?

2163
04:11:06,700 --> 04:11:15,979
If I chop you up in a meat grunt and the only thing that comes to your mind, you're probably dead.

2164
04:11:19,819 --> 04:11:21,899
My name is Lucien Malfoy.

2165
04:11:22,780 --> 04:11:23,979
I'm the new teacher in town.

2166
04:11:25,260 --> 04:11:29,260
And yes, I'm aware that your old teacher has perished.

2167
04:11:29,819 --> 04:11:32,729
This is arc.

2168
04:11:33,290 --> 04:11:34,059
Hold on.

2169
04:11:34,059 --> 04:11:34,459
Wait, wait.

2170
04:11:34,459 --> 04:11:36,069
I want to go back.

2171
04:11:36,069 --> 04:11:36,870
What did that say?

2172
04:11:36,870 --> 04:11:41,700
Chop you up in a meat grunt.

2173
04:11:41,700 --> 04:11:42,180
Death note.

2174
04:11:42,180 --> 04:11:43,299
2020 baseball stream.

2175
04:11:43,299 --> 04:11:44,659
2021 baseball stream.

2176
04:11:44,659 --> 04:11:45,940
July baseball stream.

2177
04:11:47,659 --> 04:11:51,479
Hey, August baseball stream is not written down in here.

2178
04:11:51,479 --> 04:11:52,360
I think we're fine.

2179
04:11:52,360 --> 04:11:53,239
I think we're good.

2180
04:11:53,239 --> 04:11:56,920
All right.

2181
04:11:56,920 --> 04:11:58,600
So the next one is infinity war spoilers.

2182
04:11:59,159 --> 04:12:00,760
Like it matters, but okay.

2183
04:12:00,760 --> 04:12:04,409
This is arc.

2184
04:12:04,409 --> 04:12:05,290
I don't feel so good.

2185
04:12:17,620 --> 04:12:18,659
That was stupid.

2186
04:12:18,659 --> 04:12:23,379
To be taken like this tie is so long.

2187
04:12:23,379 --> 04:12:24,260
Can you see this?

2188
04:12:25,860 --> 04:12:28,819
I look like a 10 year old wearing dad's suit to work.

2189
04:12:30,180 --> 04:12:31,059
This is ridiculous.

2190
04:12:31,059 --> 04:12:32,340
This shouldn't be like this.

2191
04:12:32,420 --> 04:12:33,940
I feel like I'm two feet tall.

2192
04:12:34,500 --> 04:12:39,379
I heard that the second game had four to five minute loading screens

2193
04:12:39,379 --> 04:12:41,540
when you went outside or inside of a building.

2194
04:12:41,540 --> 04:12:42,819
So that's why I never played it.

2195
04:12:45,590 --> 04:12:46,090
True.

2196
04:12:50,729 --> 04:12:51,229
Witches.

2197
04:12:57,049 --> 04:12:58,969
I'll not drink with weaver laws freaks.

2198
04:13:00,329 --> 04:13:01,530
I'll take a drink.

2199
04:13:01,530 --> 04:13:03,129
Beg your pardon for those thugs.

2200
04:13:03,129 --> 04:13:03,930
You don't know who I am?

2201
04:13:05,299 --> 04:13:06,500
Geralt of Rivia.

2202
04:13:07,879 --> 04:13:08,520
You should know.

2203
04:13:10,700 --> 04:13:11,659
Two orange juices.

2204
04:13:12,469 --> 04:13:14,950
I'm gonna drink one now and one later.

2205
04:13:16,440 --> 04:13:16,940
Thank you.

2206
04:13:17,879 --> 04:13:22,340
Done drinking.

2207
04:13:22,340 --> 04:13:22,819
Wait, hold on.

2208
04:13:22,819 --> 04:13:25,139
Let me do my like my patented move that I do.

2209
04:13:39,559 --> 04:13:40,059
You.

2210
04:13:40,600 --> 04:13:42,540
That's right.

2211
04:13:42,540 --> 04:13:43,180
You.

2212
04:13:43,180 --> 04:13:43,819
Any witches?

2213
04:13:44,379 --> 04:13:45,420
No, nothing.

2214
04:13:45,420 --> 04:13:46,940
I just wanted to take you aside

2215
04:13:47,579 --> 04:13:49,659
without cluing the others into what we're up to.

2216
04:13:50,379 --> 04:13:52,059
Sneaking upstairs to make love.

2217
04:13:53,260 --> 04:13:56,889
Heard you were a witch.

2218
04:13:57,530 --> 04:14:03,219
I got a letter from the king of Rivia that said that you were a witch.

2219
04:14:05,020 --> 04:14:05,520
Are you?

2220
04:14:06,540 --> 04:14:07,819
I've never played this game.

2221
04:14:09,110 --> 04:14:09,510
I don't.

2222
04:14:09,510 --> 04:14:10,549
I've never played this game.

2223
04:14:10,549 --> 04:14:12,149
I have never played any of the witchers.

2224
04:14:13,399 --> 04:14:15,479
Suddenly I have an immense desire to drink.

2225
04:14:18,149 --> 04:14:19,750
Oh, I hate those motherfuckers.

2226
04:14:24,100 --> 04:14:25,780
I think we're down to the final two.

2227
04:14:25,780 --> 04:14:29,979
Let me check.

2228
04:14:29,979 --> 04:14:33,239
Yeah, so we're down to the final three.

2229
04:14:33,239 --> 04:14:33,959
There are three more.

2230
04:14:35,620 --> 04:14:37,299
This one, one more, and one more.

2231
04:14:37,299 --> 04:14:37,940
Here we go.

2232
04:14:37,940 --> 04:14:39,059
Derma gets a coffee.

2233
04:14:39,059 --> 04:14:44,920
I think I still fucking got it.

2234
04:14:44,920 --> 04:14:46,729
Hey, what's up, man?

2235
04:14:46,729 --> 04:14:47,049
How are...

2236
04:14:47,049 --> 04:14:48,090
Hey, what's up?

2237
04:14:48,090 --> 04:14:50,969
There's the cream.

2238
04:14:51,770 --> 04:14:52,979
Why'd you pull a chair up?

2239
04:14:52,979 --> 04:14:53,620
There's the sugar.

2240
04:14:54,340 --> 04:14:55,059
There's the milk.

2241
04:14:55,620 --> 04:14:56,739
Hey, what's up, bro?

2242
04:14:56,739 --> 04:14:57,379
How are you doing?

2243
04:14:57,379 --> 04:14:58,659
Yeah, I got a coffee for you.

2244
04:14:58,659 --> 04:14:59,700
Brewed it right before you got in.

2245
04:14:59,700 --> 04:15:00,420
I knew you were...

2246
04:15:00,420 --> 04:15:01,139
I know your order.

2247
04:15:01,139 --> 04:15:02,340
Come on, I don't know your order.

2248
04:15:05,899 --> 04:15:06,620
That's my new...

2249
04:15:06,620 --> 04:15:07,819
That's freshly brewed, by the way.

2250
04:15:57,209 --> 04:15:58,409
Hey, how you doing?

2251
04:16:02,659 --> 04:16:09,829
That was good.

2252
04:16:09,829 --> 04:16:10,469
That was a good one.

2253
04:16:13,399 --> 04:16:14,040
Final two.

2254
04:16:14,840 --> 04:16:19,399
Derma barbecue.

2255
04:16:19,399 --> 04:16:32,540
Grill master.

2256
04:16:32,540 --> 04:16:34,139
There he is, the grill master.

2257
04:16:34,139 --> 04:16:35,180
Yeah, yeah.

2258
04:16:35,180 --> 04:16:37,819
Because nobody else wants to fucking do it.

2259
04:16:39,420 --> 04:16:40,540
So I do it.

2260
04:16:40,540 --> 04:16:41,579
And I sit here all day.

2261
04:16:41,579 --> 04:16:41,979
I want to...

2262
04:16:41,979 --> 04:16:42,459
You know what I think?

2263
04:16:42,459 --> 04:16:43,180
I want to be back there.

2264
04:16:44,139 --> 04:16:44,540
What's that?

2265
04:16:44,540 --> 04:16:45,420
No, no.

2266
04:16:46,219 --> 04:16:47,739
You're doing a great job out there, son.

2267
04:16:49,780 --> 04:16:51,620
Pete, don't climb that.

2268
04:16:51,620 --> 04:16:53,139
Don't get down from there.

2269
04:16:53,139 --> 04:16:54,020
Don't climb that.

2270
04:16:54,020 --> 04:16:55,059
How do you mind?

2271
04:16:55,059 --> 04:16:56,100
Don't climb that.

2272
04:16:57,700 --> 04:16:59,219
He's a maniac, I know, right?

2273
04:17:00,739 --> 04:17:01,780
He's my son, right?

2274
04:17:01,780 --> 04:17:02,180
Yeah, I know.

2275
04:17:03,139 --> 04:17:04,139
You want...

2276
04:17:04,139 --> 04:17:04,940
You ready for a dog?

2277
04:17:05,899 --> 04:17:08,700
You don't want a dog.

2278
04:17:08,700 --> 04:17:09,659
I love how much this...

2279
04:17:09,659 --> 04:17:10,219
You want dogs?

2280
04:17:10,219 --> 04:17:11,020
Oh my god.

2281
04:17:12,940 --> 04:17:13,979
Oh my god.

2282
04:17:22,620 --> 04:17:23,180
All right.

2283
04:17:25,909 --> 04:17:26,950
There is one more.

2284
04:17:28,010 --> 04:17:29,930
Final one of the evening.

2285
04:17:31,049 --> 04:17:40,100
Oh my...

2286
04:17:40,100 --> 04:17:40,420
Okay.

2287
04:17:42,010 --> 04:17:43,209
Why did you put it...

2288
04:17:43,209 --> 04:17:43,450
All right.

2289
04:17:43,450 --> 04:17:44,979
All right.

2290
04:17:44,979 --> 04:17:46,180
Okay, everybody settle down.

2291
04:17:48,170 --> 04:17:48,969
Settle down.

2292
04:17:48,969 --> 04:17:51,590
They're sneaking him in.

2293
04:17:51,590 --> 04:17:52,629
They're sneaking him in.

2294
04:17:52,629 --> 04:17:54,229
This is the actually last one.

2295
04:17:54,229 --> 04:17:58,489
Hello.

2296
04:17:58,489 --> 04:17:59,610
Yeah, and guess what?

2297
04:17:59,610 --> 04:18:00,729
You can hear me, huh?

2298
04:18:00,729 --> 04:18:01,860
You can hear me pretty well.

2299
04:18:02,659 --> 04:18:03,700
Not like it was before.

2300
04:18:04,899 --> 04:18:06,420
Well, while this plays out in the background,

2301
04:18:07,139 --> 04:18:08,180
we'll skip to a random place.

2302
04:18:11,239 --> 04:18:15,270
Thank you everybody that gave any submissions.

2303
04:18:16,780 --> 04:18:19,020
This is some of the best submissions we've ever seen.

2304
04:18:19,020 --> 04:18:22,540
I don't know who gave it to me.

2305
04:18:22,540 --> 04:18:24,620
But yeah, incredible work.

2306
04:18:24,620 --> 04:18:29,219
That's just about almost 250, 300 videos.

2307
04:18:29,219 --> 04:18:30,940
I can hear my heart.

2308
04:18:30,940 --> 04:18:32,780
Out of hundreds and hundreds of submissions.

2309
04:18:36,139 --> 04:18:38,059
Yeah, I'm floored every time we do one of these

2310
04:18:38,059 --> 04:18:41,020
just because of how good and how creative

2311
04:18:41,020 --> 04:18:45,129
and how much actual time you guys put into these.

2312
04:18:45,129 --> 04:18:47,979
Will green screen ever come back?

2313
04:18:47,979 --> 04:18:52,899
I mean, it's tough to say because I have to be into it, right?

2314
04:18:52,899 --> 04:18:54,680
The reason why I did it again

2315
04:18:54,680 --> 04:18:57,459
was just because I got that urge to do it.

2316
04:18:57,459 --> 04:19:00,180
And I have to want to get in front of that green screen

2317
04:19:00,180 --> 04:19:01,940
because that's where I have the most fun.

2318
04:19:01,940 --> 04:19:03,590
So it's just going to happen.

2319
04:19:03,590 --> 04:19:04,709
It might just happen again.

2320
04:19:04,709 --> 04:19:05,190
I don't know.

2321
04:19:06,500 --> 04:19:07,620
But I never want to just be like,

2322
04:19:07,620 --> 04:19:08,500
no, I'm going to do it next week.

2323
04:19:09,139 --> 04:19:11,540
Because I've got to want to do it, right?

2324
04:19:15,020 --> 04:19:16,459
Thanks to anybody that participated,

2325
04:19:16,459 --> 04:19:17,659
anybody that sent anything in.

2326
04:19:20,760 --> 04:19:23,000
Yes, the playlist, there's two playlists.

2327
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:25,479
There's DLC and there's the original playlist.

2328
04:19:25,479 --> 04:19:27,079
Both are going to be available for you to watch.

2329
04:19:29,500 --> 04:19:31,690
And then for the other submissions,

2330
04:19:31,690 --> 04:19:32,569
I don't know if there's anything

2331
04:19:32,569 --> 04:19:34,250
going to happen with the other ones.

2332
04:19:34,250 --> 04:19:36,170
It's tough to kind of be like, all right,

2333
04:19:36,170 --> 04:19:37,610
should we do a third playlist

2334
04:19:37,610 --> 04:19:39,290
and put it in the Discord or something?

2335
04:19:39,290 --> 04:19:42,649
Or should we let people just put their work into the Discord

2336
04:19:42,649 --> 04:19:45,899
and maybe just share it with each other?

2337
04:19:45,899 --> 04:19:48,329
Stuff like that might be something we might do.

2338
04:19:48,329 --> 04:19:53,190
But obviously, no guarantees or anything.

2339
04:19:53,190 --> 04:19:55,940
But that was amazing.

2340
04:19:55,940 --> 04:20:00,409
And everybody, get hype for baseball.

2341
04:20:00,409 --> 04:20:01,850
That wasn't in the Death Notebook.

2342
04:20:04,979 --> 04:20:08,219
All right, shut this guy off.

2343
04:20:08,219 --> 04:20:13,700
August 19th at 430 Pacific.

2344
04:20:13,700 --> 04:20:16,120
That's this coming Friday,

2345
04:20:16,120 --> 04:20:19,239
is the Germa Baseball Association presents

2346
04:20:19,239 --> 04:20:22,600
the California Circus versus the Maryland Magicians.

2347
04:20:22,600 --> 04:20:25,700
It's going to be a full nine innings of baseball.

2348
04:20:25,700 --> 04:20:28,219
I'm the only umpire in the whole game.

2349
04:20:28,940 --> 04:20:30,540
It's going to be fucking wild.

2350
04:20:30,540 --> 04:20:32,010
I'll just tell you that.

2351
04:20:32,010 --> 04:20:34,760
So that's one I don't think I'd want to miss

2352
04:20:34,760 --> 04:20:35,959
if I were you and I were here

2353
04:20:35,959 --> 04:20:37,239
and I was watching this channel.

2354
04:20:37,239 --> 04:20:41,510
The Germa Baseball Association is a go.

2355
04:20:41,510 --> 04:20:45,610
Friday, this Friday at 430 Pacific.

2356
04:20:45,610 --> 04:20:57,979
I wonder who's going to win.

2357
04:20:57,979 --> 04:21:00,809
I wonder who you guys are going to root for

2358
04:21:00,809 --> 04:21:04,649
because they're both going to be awesome.

2359
04:21:04,649 --> 04:21:07,770
So I'm incredibly excited for it.

2360
04:21:07,770 --> 04:21:11,379
You know, every four or five months or so,

2361
04:21:11,379 --> 04:21:12,579
once every six months,

2362
04:21:12,579 --> 04:21:15,739
try to do something really extravagant.

2363
04:21:15,739 --> 04:21:18,440
And this is one of those things.

2364
04:21:18,440 --> 04:21:20,120
It should be a lot of fun.

2365
04:21:20,120 --> 04:21:21,399
Hey, whatever happens,

2366
04:21:21,399 --> 04:21:22,840
it will be fun to do regardless.

2367
04:21:22,840 --> 04:21:24,459
So I hope you enjoy it.

2368
04:21:24,459 --> 04:21:26,520
The next time you will see me,

2369
04:21:26,520 --> 04:21:30,069
we'll be on the Germa Baseball Association stream.

2370
04:21:30,069 --> 04:21:31,190
August 19th again.

2371
04:21:31,190 --> 04:21:32,860
Don't forget it.

2372
04:21:32,860 --> 04:21:33,899
I'll tweet about it too.

2373
04:21:33,899 --> 04:21:35,340
It's probably tomorrow, the next day.

2374
04:21:35,340 --> 04:21:36,700
Type it up a little bit more.

2375
04:21:36,700 --> 04:21:38,620
See you soon though.

2376
04:21:40,120 --> 04:21:44,569
Yeah, Grump will post the video playlists

2377
04:21:44,569 --> 04:21:49,110
in the Discord too, probably, I would assume.

2378
04:21:49,110 --> 04:21:54,420
That concludes the green screen movie night.

2379
04:21:54,420 --> 04:21:55,299
The second one.

2380
04:21:55,299 --> 04:22:00,010
What about the dog video?

2381
04:22:00,010 --> 04:22:04,469
Will there be baseball merch?

2382
04:22:04,469 --> 04:22:07,670
Yes, there will be baseball merchandise around the show.

2383
04:22:07,670 --> 04:22:09,500
I promise you that.

2384
04:22:09,500 --> 04:22:17,020
I'll just keep the dog video in there.

2385
04:22:17,020 --> 04:22:19,739
Why not?

2386
04:22:19,739 --> 04:22:20,860
Yeah, who are you rooting for?

2387
04:22:21,420 --> 04:22:21,899
I don't know.

2388
04:22:21,899 --> 04:22:24,139
I think you have to wait till they're on screen

2389
04:22:24,139 --> 04:22:26,899
before you find out who your favorite team is.

2390
04:22:26,899 --> 04:22:29,299
It's going to be very, very hard for you to decide.

2391
04:22:29,299 --> 04:22:32,069
So many people are like,

2392
04:22:32,069 --> 04:22:33,430
oh, the circus, the clowns.

2393
04:22:33,430 --> 04:22:34,629
Oh yeah, the magicians.

2394
04:22:35,590 --> 04:22:37,030
Just wait.

2395
04:22:37,030 --> 04:22:39,030
Let the first hour of that stream happen

2396
04:22:39,030 --> 04:22:40,229
before you figure that out.

2397
04:22:40,229 --> 04:22:51,299
Have you been physically preparing for this?

2398
04:22:51,299 --> 04:22:55,750
Yes, I have been physically preparing,

2399
04:22:55,750 --> 04:22:56,950
both mentally and physically,

2400
04:22:56,950 --> 04:22:57,989
because I need to know.

2401
04:22:57,989 --> 04:23:02,780
I've been studying umpire terminology and umpire rules

2402
04:23:02,780 --> 04:23:14,360
and how to regulate and keep a baseball game going smoothly.

2403
04:23:14,360 --> 04:23:16,860
Can we bet on who wins?

2404
04:23:16,860 --> 04:23:18,940
Yeah, I'm sure we could do that at the beginning.

2405
04:23:18,940 --> 04:23:20,149
The mods will be on top of it.

2406
04:23:20,149 --> 04:23:22,760
Mods will just do it.

2407
04:23:22,760 --> 04:23:25,239
Maybe before the game starts in the pre-show,

2408
04:23:25,239 --> 04:23:27,000
like kind of while you guys are hanging out,

2409
04:23:27,000 --> 04:23:28,040
maybe we can start one.

2410
04:23:28,040 --> 04:23:37,340
That sounds like a plan.

2411
04:23:37,340 --> 04:23:39,340
Is merch going to be after the stream?

2412
04:23:39,340 --> 04:23:41,899
Yeah, it'll be after the stream is over.

2413
04:23:41,899 --> 04:23:45,899
It'll be at 50% exactly.

2414
04:23:45,899 --> 04:24:07,979
California Circus, brute for your team.

2415
04:24:07,979 --> 04:24:09,819
Go magicians, go.

2416
04:24:09,819 --> 04:24:11,100
How long do nine innings take?

2417
04:24:12,629 --> 04:24:15,670
Well, in a regular game of baseball,

2418
04:24:15,670 --> 04:24:18,659
it could take somewhere between two and a half

2419
04:24:18,659 --> 04:24:19,620
to three and a half hours,

2420
04:24:19,620 --> 04:24:23,850
but this is not a regular baseball game.

2421
04:24:23,850 --> 04:24:28,010
It's regular baseball, but it's not a regular game.

2422
04:24:28,010 --> 04:24:31,559
That's all I'm going to say,

2423
04:24:31,559 --> 04:24:32,680
but it's going to be nine innings.

2424
04:24:33,750 --> 04:24:35,190
What will you do if it rains?

2425
04:24:35,190 --> 04:24:38,149
Well, it's not going to rain, so stop saying that.

2426
04:24:38,149 --> 04:24:39,829
We're not going to, we don't talk about rain.

2427
04:24:40,889 --> 04:24:42,489
There's a rain delay in baseball.

2428
04:24:43,129 --> 04:24:44,250
If it is raining, we wait.

2429
04:24:45,739 --> 04:24:47,500
We will have, we'll have to wait

2430
04:24:47,500 --> 04:24:48,700
for a rain delay potentially.

2431
04:24:50,180 --> 04:24:52,340
Or if it's light enough, we just go.

2432
04:24:53,219 --> 04:24:55,379
That you, people, they play baseball in the rain.

2433
04:24:55,940 --> 04:24:58,340
I don't think it's going to rain, so don't worry.

2434
04:24:59,219 --> 04:25:00,340
But there are plans in place.

2435
04:25:00,979 --> 04:25:08,819
Are there going to be any special guests?

2436
04:25:08,819 --> 04:25:11,340
No, that I can tell you for sure.

2437
04:25:17,850 --> 04:25:18,729
What if it snows?

2438
04:25:18,729 --> 04:25:19,610
That would be strange.

2439
04:25:20,170 --> 04:25:24,440
No, there are no special guests.

2440
04:25:26,340 --> 04:25:28,899
Unless you want to say that the baseball teams

2441
04:25:28,899 --> 04:25:30,500
playing are the guests, which I would say, yeah.

2442
04:25:31,219 --> 04:25:33,139
But those are, I would say, special guests.

2443
04:25:33,780 --> 04:25:40,040
What if the baseball stops working?

2444
04:25:40,600 --> 04:25:41,850
We'll just get another one.

2445
04:25:50,540 --> 04:25:51,340
All right, that's it.

2446
04:25:51,979 --> 04:25:55,260
Just, just show up on Friday.

2447
04:25:56,870 --> 04:25:57,829
That's all I can tell you.

2448
04:25:59,659 --> 04:26:01,500
What if the baseball won't fit?

2449
04:26:01,500 --> 04:26:03,100
Just, everything's going to be fine.

2450
04:26:03,100 --> 04:26:04,219
Just show up on Friday.

2451
04:26:05,559 --> 04:26:06,520
With that, I'll see you later.

2452
04:26:08,579 --> 04:26:10,899
Wish, wish us luck in the pre-production

2453
04:26:10,899 --> 04:26:11,700
here over the next week.

2454
04:26:13,860 --> 04:26:15,299
There's a lot of moving parts on this show,

2455
04:26:15,299 --> 04:26:17,219
kind of like we've described.

2456
04:26:17,219 --> 04:26:19,459
There are, it is a full baseball game

2457
04:26:19,459 --> 04:26:20,979
with two full baseball teams.

2458
04:26:21,700 --> 04:26:23,780
So there's a lot to do.

2459
04:26:24,420 --> 04:26:26,020
So I'll talk to you guys soon.

2460
04:26:26,020 --> 04:26:27,139
See you on Friday.

2461
04:26:27,139 --> 04:26:29,540
Take care of yourselves and good night.

2462
04:26:30,100 --> 04:26:33,190
Friday, August 19th at 430 Pacific.

2463
04:26:34,940 --> 04:26:36,379
Go, go, go, go.

2464
04:26:37,180 --> 04:26:38,100
Good night, guys.

2465
04:27:18,180 --> 04:27:19,940
Make sure to call your mother.
