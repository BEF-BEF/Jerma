1
00:00:44,859 --> 00:11:47,110
These? These are my sub-girls.

2
00:11:47,110 --> 00:12:02,919
Hey! Whoa!

3
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,919
Dama!

4
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,919
Tipatalo!

5
00:12:06,919 --> 00:13:00,419
Look at Andrew.

6
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,429
That's right. Look at Andrew. Never heard of him.

7
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:50,340
I'm going to see my armpits. So I'll lift my arms up.

8
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:57,509
Yep!

9
00:13:57,509 --> 00:16:19,110
My sub-girls.

10
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:52,460
Yep!

11
00:16:52,460 --> 00:19:58,980
Yep!

12
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:29,640
Can't breathe without these.

13
00:20:29,640 --> 00:21:54,440
I feel like I'm making a TikTok video.

14
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Who'd say like this is the lip I was doing?

15
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,650
Whoo!

16
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:33,210
Just a little too big.

17
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,210
Can't breathe without these.

18
00:22:35,210 --> 00:24:54,089
I feel like I'm making a TikTok video.

19
00:24:54,089 --> 00:26:18,759
Who'd say like this is the lip I was doing?

20
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,759
Whoo!

21
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:34,059
Just a little too big.

22
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:58,630
Can't breathe without these.

23
00:26:58,630 --> 00:29:17,640
I broke the watch.

24
00:29:17,640 --> 00:32:54,710
We should have started like five minutes ago.

25
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,710
We had to tape the watch on my hand.

26
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,019
I was putting it on and I was panicking.

27
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,579
And the thing just like shattered in my hands.

28
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,579
But anyways, how was it?

29
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:06,460
I broke the watch on my hands.

30
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,460
But anyways, hi. Welcome to day two of the dollhouse.

31
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,460
Do you need an introduction?

32
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Should I give you an introduction?

33
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,460
Or do you already know how this works?

34
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
You should by now.

35
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,460
I'm going to go take a look inside.

36
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
Oh my god! I look fucking awful!

37
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
I'm going to be so self-conscious.

38
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,460
I don't wear this shit.

39
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,460
You understand?

40
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,460
In my own home I don't wear this.

41
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Because I'm embarrassed about my neck

42
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,460
and shoulders and stomach come out.

43
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,460
And I think you can see my nipples through the shirt.

44
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,460
But I'm going to try to do my best to make sure you can't see that.

45
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,019
Let's go in the house.

46
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,250
The seats have been cleaned up.

47
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,250
You notice something in the trash out there?

48
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,250
Because I'm not sleeping on that fucking mattress.

49
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,250
That's not going to happen.

50
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,250
I'm not sleeping on that.

51
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,250
Because it's actually dirty.

52
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,549
Actually dirty.

53
00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:01,160
I look like a fucking idiot.

54
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,430
You know the bathroom?

55
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,430
Probably pretty well at this point I would assume.

56
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,739
I love this bathroom.

57
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,739
Although I could use a little bit more stuff.

58
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,739
Please be aware.

59
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,739
You are in control of 98% of everything that happens on this stream.

60
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,260
Just be aware of that.

61
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,880
Should we check this door?

62
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,440
What do you think? Should I go in here?

63
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,000
Does this door work? We'll find out.

64
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,079
I can't open it. It's locked.

65
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,119
Oh!

66
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,119
That's where the bed is.

67
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,119
That's right. I built it.

68
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,119
It was broken.

69
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,380
That's why I decided to put it.

70
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,380
Because you got it for me at the end of the stream.

71
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,380
It took me like six hours to build it.

72
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,809
This is nice and comfy.

73
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,980
I actually kind of like how this looks.

74
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,929
Can we see?

75
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:11,929
Can you get it?

76
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:13,929
Can I like home shopping network this thing?

77
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:17,559
It's so stupid.

78
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,559
I feel like that mouse.

79
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,559
Who I'm not going to say on a stream like this.

80
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,559
I feel like that mouse wears this kind of stuff.

81
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,559
I feel like he has like 30 of these.

82
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,559
But we never see him wear it.

83
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,559
I guarantee he hasn't.

84
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,860
Welcome back though.

85
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
Actually, you know from the front.

86
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,860
From the front it looks okay.

87
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,860
But from the side it doesn't.

88
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,420
I need to like get a bigger chest.

89
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,050
But I got like these flickering arms.

90
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,050
Like I'm going to.

91
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,610
I can go like that.

92
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,420
I love the bedroom.

93
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,030
You got more choices now, don't you?

94
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,099
Toilet? I don't have to go.

95
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,099
Just so you can be aware that it is available.

96
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,099
Eventually I probably want to take these gloves off.

97
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,929
Enjoy the game.

98
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:09,929
Good luck.

99
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:12,550
I got full bars.

100
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:19,269
Which means I can do this.

101
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,769
That's embarrassing. I just did that.

102
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:25,860
How many people are here?

103
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
That was like actually pretty embarrassing to do with this many people.

104
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
73,000 people just watched me do that.

105
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
That's like embarrassing.

106
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,860
Back in like during like school plays.

107
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,860
There'd be like fucking 40 people in the audience.

108
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:56,139
They're...

109
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:58,139
No, I'm not peeing on them.

110
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:00,570
I'm not peeing on the flowers.

111
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,570
Why is that the piss sound?

112
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,570
That's not water flowers.

113
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,860
I'm going to stand like this.

114
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
So people don't think that's what's happening.

115
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
I enjoyed that very much though.

116
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,860
I did.

117
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
I'll tell you from the front this looks good.

118
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,380
Wait a minute.

119
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,179
We're going to do the same joke from the other day.

120
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:29,380
I still got it.

121
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,880
But what I was going to say is

122
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,880
back when I was a young, young boy

123
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,880
there'd be

124
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
school plays.

125
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
You're in like the fourth grade, the fifth grade.

126
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Only people's parents

127
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
came to that shit.

128
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Maybe the principal, maybe the old lady

129
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
that played the piano during the entire show.

130
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,880
She would just

131
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
every scene it would be like

132
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
that lady was like super into it.

133
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
I kind of wish we had one of those ladies.

134
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
We don't.

135
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
But the difference is

136
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
with 40 people's parents it's 70,000 people.

137
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,119
I don't know how many of you are.

138
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,119
Actually I think my mother is watching.

139
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,860
I'm going to go lie in the bed.

140
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,860
I'm going to go check the bed out.

141
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,590
Parasocial Andy.

142
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:23,590
What?

143
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,920
I'm going to check the bed out.

144
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,809
Okay.

145
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,980
There it is. There's the first one.

146
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:45,210
I actually

147
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,210
talked about the fart thing.

148
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,210
And I said five farts an hour.

149
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,210
There's more than five farts an hour.

150
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,210
So it's going to be in a lot of trouble.

151
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,210
It was five fart sounds an hour.

152
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,219
There was one.

153
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:03,019
I want you to keep track.

154
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:14,409
Okay, let's go.

155
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:21,699
I'll watch out for that manhole.

156
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:36,099
Do you see the mattress?

157
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:41,099
I'm in the right clothes for this.

158
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,239
Ugh.

159
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,610
Not sleeping on this.

160
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,610
We actually talked about this after day one.

161
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:52,039
I'm like

162
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,039
not a chance that I actually lie on this.

163
00:39:54,039 --> 00:40:03,690
No way.

164
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,059
I got the popcorn maker.

165
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:08,809
Except it doesn't do anything.

166
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:27,300
Because I don't want to get electrocuted.

167
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:33,449
Check mail. Sure.

168
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:40,980
Why not? Mail.

169
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:51,849
Check the mail. What's in the mail today?

170
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:58,119
Let's find out.

171
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,619
This is somebody's shoe that's here.

172
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:02,619
Somebody actually on set here.

173
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:04,619
This is their shoe.

174
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,570
I don't know whose it is, but I don't know why it's in here.

175
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,059
What is it?

176
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:16,199
Has somebody worn this

177
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:18,949
in the last few days?

178
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:24,780
Money?

179
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,000
There's twenty bucks in the shoe.

180
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Who would do this?

181
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,300
What kind of fucked up neighborhood is this?

182
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:40,519
Thanks for the twenty dollars.

183
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,519
What do we start with? Three hundred?

184
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:46,280
So that's what? Three twenty?

185
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,309
How much money? Forty? What?

186
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:52,309
I thought we started with three hundred dollars.

187
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,920
Oh, they bought the upgraded house.

188
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,920
Right. But why don't we have any money?

189
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,159
How are we supposed to get any money?

190
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,159
How are they going to buy anything?

191
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:07,510
I'm talking to you.

192
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,510
Remember, I have to go to work to make money.

193
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:16,869
If you don't send me to work, then it's not going to happen.

194
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:22,099
Oh! Got you.

195
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:25,619
I actually hit myself in the head.

196
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,619
I went for like a joke.

197
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,619
And I didn't fucking get it right.

198
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,460
My knee was in the wrong place

199
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,460
and that actually just hit me right in the forehead.

200
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,150
Ah!

201
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,519
I do actually feel pretty... I need to take a shower.

202
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:49,179
Let me get in here.

203
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:54,599
Don't close that.

204
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,860
I just figured it out.

205
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,860
You got to keep these bars green, otherwise how am I going to get promoted?

206
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
How are you going to make more money?

207
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,380
How are you going to be able to get more stuff in the house?

208
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,380
You can't, unless you actually

209
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,380
play and get me there.

210
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,070
I want green bars.

211
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:20,630
Coming up. Coming up.

212
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:34,650
I hit the watch.

213
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,650
I'm getting a little tired though.

214
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,179
Starting to wane a little.

215
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:45,179
I want cool items. I want fun stuff.

216
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:47,179
I want things to lie down on.

217
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:49,179
I want things to play with.

218
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:51,179
I don't just want...

219
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:53,800
What was that?

220
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Go to work. I missed work by like four hours already.

221
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,429
Go to work?

222
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,989
Alright, I'm going to work.

223
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,989
Alright, fine.

224
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:07,260
I'm going to work.

225
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:17,110
I'm coming!

226
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:42,650
Night shift.

227
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,920
Thanks for the ride.

228
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:56,500
Goodbye!

229
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
That just made me wane.

230
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,000
That just made me tired.

231
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
That just brought my energy to zero.

232
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:09,289
It wasn't working for like six or seven hours.

233
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,289
It was doing the goodbye

234
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:13,289
like five times

235
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:16,039
is what made me tired.

236
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:21,289
I'm exhausted though.

237
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:28,139
Tired and a little hungry.

238
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:30,760
At least we made some money.

239
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,760
I'm hungry though.

240
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,769
How much money is in the account now?

241
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:37,769
$200? $140?

242
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,769
I'm going to my bedroom.

243
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:41,769
I haven't been able to sit in here for very long.

244
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:43,769
I'm going to my bedroom which is a little odd.

245
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,679
I'm going to lock myself out of one of these rooms eventually.

246
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:56,440
Oh man.

247
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:03,539
Tired.

248
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:07,820
Make a phone call. Who am I calling?

249
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,820
Call who?

250
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,309
Who am I calling?

251
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:15,510
I got a call?

252
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,820
No sleeping?

253
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,820
What are you talking about?

254
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:28,500
Oh!

255
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:36,250
Mom!

256
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,369
Yeah, it's me.

257
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:41,860
Yeah, it's been an interesting day or two.

258
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,489
It's actually really remarkable

259
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:46,489
that I can even talk to you mom

260
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:48,489
considering that I just pulled the line out of the wall.

261
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:50,489
So this is really good.

262
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:52,489
Some kind of alien technology which is interesting.

263
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:54,920
Oh yeah, no, hi. Hello, sorry.

264
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,920
I forgot to say like hi. How are you?

265
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,099
Yeah, it's good to hear your voice.

266
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,099
You're the only person I know.

267
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:03,099
That's kind of interesting.

268
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:06,170
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:47:06,170 --> 00:53:53,190
And so I...

270
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,750
Oh, what?

271
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,699
Right, right, this shit.

272
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:14,949
That's right.

273
00:54:14,949 --> 00:54:22,489
Okay, my couch is fucking ugly.

274
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:25,500
Mom?

275
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,460
Are you still on the phone?

276
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,239
Mom? I don't know.

277
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:35,239
Hopefully she thinks I'm alright.

278
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,420
Let me put this back.

279
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:42,199
What is this?

280
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:44,949
Can I get this back on?

281
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,820
Yeah, whatever, it'll stay.

282
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,820
Oh, yes! Oh, I love that!

283
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,309
Oh, sofa!

284
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:54,309
Ew. Yuck.

285
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:59,690
Yuck.

286
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:14,460
What is this? I don't want that.

287
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,460
I want one piece of singular bread.

288
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:25,610
I feel awful.

289
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:28,039
I hate sleeping on the ground.

290
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:30,039
Let me go to bed, alright?

291
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,039
Like, okay, there's a sofa here now.

292
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:34,039
There's a bed in the other room.

293
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,039
Don't make me use the phone.

294
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:38,039
If my energy's low and I'm just...

295
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:40,039
I'm hangry, alright? Just let me talk to you for a second.

296
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:42,039
If you put me in the bed and let me go to sleep,

297
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,039
then this won't happen.

298
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:46,039
You'll have plenty of opportunity and I'm gonna piss my shit

299
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:54,099
shit my pants.

300
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:56,099
I'm just eating a piece of bread. I'm eating one piece of bread.

301
00:55:56,099 --> 00:56:05,750
It's good.

302
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,179
It's actually pretty good.

303
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:11,190
This is a good bread.

304
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,750
What kind of bread is this?

305
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,750
It's multigrain.

306
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,750
I eat multigrain bread.

307
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,750
I don't. I actually think that stuff's gross.

308
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:26,579
Okay, that was good.

309
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:31,510
Delicious.

310
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,510
Don't just leave it.

311
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:39,719
Disgusting.

312
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:45,530
I'm gonna do a thing that everybody does.

313
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,530
I'm gonna go to work.

314
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:56,980
Wait. Wait for me.

315
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:02,230
Wait for me.

316
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:40,760
One just full piece of white bread.

317
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,760
I've been at work all day trying to eat.

318
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,280
I've been chewing this single piece of white bread

319
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,280
for fucking six hours.

320
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,159
It's like eating saltines.

321
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:58,980
Everybody at work thought I was chewing gum.

322
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,980
I was like, no, I ate a whole

323
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,980
piece of white bread before I came in.

324
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,380
They were like, dude,

325
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,380
what did you have for breakfast today?

326
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,380
The first time I went like this

327
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,380
with a piece of white bread,

328
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,380
and they were like, do you want to go to McDonald's?

329
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:22,039
I'm like, I don't know. No.

330
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:24,039
I'm fucking horrible.

331
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:35,860
I feel awful.

332
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,550
I can see it.

333
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,139
I can see it.

334
00:58:42,139 --> 00:58:49,239
Please help me.

335
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:51,670
Please help me.

336
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,670
Please. I can see it.

337
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,670
I can literally see the fucking toilet

338
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:00,579
in front of me.

339
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:04,150
What was that?

340
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,150
Wait, wait, wait.

341
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:12,659
Who's at the door?

342
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:14,659
This is my pants.

343
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:18,820
I'm coming.

344
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:24,460
Uncle Ted.

345
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,460
It's been so long.

346
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,079
What is he doing here?

347
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:31,079
I went to spring training. I told your mother I was going.

348
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:35,079
Look at the nice couch you got here.

349
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:37,320
You got good taste.

350
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,320
He's dead.

351
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,320
What are you doing here?

352
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,320
Give me a hug.

353
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,320
He's so fucking cold.

354
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,320
He's freezing.

355
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,320
What's the matter with you?

356
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,320
Let's go.

357
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,320
I went to my house.

358
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,320
I went to my house. You know what's there?

359
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,320
Nothing. I got no furniture.

360
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,619
That looks familiar.

361
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:01,619
I don't know what God I angered.

362
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:03,619
I'm sorry.

363
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:05,619
Oh, you like my couch?

364
01:00:05,619 --> 01:00:07,619
It's beautiful.

365
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:09,619
I haven't had a beer in about 50...

366
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:11,619
Gemma!

367
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:14,440
Hey, hey, Uncle Ted!

368
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,440
You're going to pee so bad.

369
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,440
Uncle Ted!

370
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,440
There's a fucking ghost in my house.

371
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,739
This motherfucker is dead.

372
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:24,739
Gemma!

373
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:26,739
Is that the bathroom?

374
01:00:26,739 --> 01:00:28,739
No, no, no.

375
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:30,739
I need to do something about this.

376
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:32,739
He has to pass on.

377
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:34,739
I've got all the time in the world.

378
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:37,500
The ghost of the goddamn walking dead.

379
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Take your time.

380
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,670
Sometimes it takes a little while.

381
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,909
Lord, start at 100.

382
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,909
I'm going to pass him on to the other world.

383
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,909
I don't know what happened. I don't know what God I angered.

384
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:51,909
I don't know what I did. I don't know who I'm angering.

385
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:53,909
I'm going to run to Donald.

386
01:00:53,909 --> 01:00:55,909
Gemma!

387
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:57,909
Gemma!

388
01:00:57,909 --> 01:00:59,909
I'm going to get him to the other side. That would be fantastic.

389
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:01,909
I don't want to be haunted anymore. I want to pass on wealth.

390
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:04,409
Look at my spoons.

391
01:01:04,409 --> 01:01:06,409
Those are my spoons. That looks like my couch.

392
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:08,409
I'm going to shit my pants.

393
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:16,579
I got that one.

394
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:19,849
I got that one in Dollywood.

395
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:21,849
Hey!

396
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,090
I love my grandson.

397
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,090
Hey, so how are you?

398
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,900
Are you ready for Uncle Ted?

399
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,900
You're not supposed to be here, Ted.

400
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,900
I'm not supposed to be here.

401
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,900
I had to get your address off somebody

402
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,900
because your mother, freaking mother, my sister,

403
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,900
my house is empty of furniture.

404
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,900
But this looks familiar. That looks familiar.

405
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,900
And those are my spoons.

406
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,900
I got that one in Dollywood.

407
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,900
I got that one in...

408
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,900
I've got a ghost that needs to go to the other goddamn side.

409
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,900
He's haunting me.

410
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
Come on.

411
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,900
Yeah, you're coming as soon as you can.

412
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,900
Ted, Ted, how are you?

413
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,900
Who's on the phone?

414
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,900
I was just calling my friend,

415
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,900
Granit Reapelson.

416
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,900
Granit Reapelson?

417
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,900
Yeah, they're an old family friend.

418
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,900
You played soccer with him, didn't you?

419
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,900
I went to one of your games and you played soccer with him.

420
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,900
I did, I did.

421
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,900
Did you go to the other world?

422
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,900
No, I'm good.

423
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,900
There's no money hidden under any mattresses?

424
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,900
No, actually, I had no money.

425
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,900
Somebody cleaned out my account when I was in spring training.

426
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,900
I went down to see this octet.

427
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,900
Let me get the door.

428
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,900
Just stay there for a minute.

429
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,900
Stay there for just a second.

430
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,900
I'm here for Ted.

431
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,900
Please come in.

432
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,690
Where does this go?

433
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,690
Yeah, he's over here. He's having some trouble

434
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,690
on the other side, if you could.

435
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,690
Hey, how are you?

436
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:49,690
This is my friend.

437
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:51,690
By the way, I don't think I've ever said about you.

438
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,690
It was just a joke.

439
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,690
If there's anything you need to say to me,

440
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,690
should I know anything about anything?

441
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,690
Dress up? Is this dress up?

442
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,690
Ted.

443
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,690
Yeah, yeah, it is.

444
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,690
It's time for you to come home, Ted.

445
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,690
It's time.

446
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,690
Well, there's no furniture in my home.

447
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,690
No, Ted, not that kind of home.

448
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:15,690
It's time for the long farewell, Ted.

449
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,380
I'm feeling kind of cold.

450
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,380
Shh.

451
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,380
No more tears.

452
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,380
Only dreams.

453
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,380
Come on. Come on now.

454
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,380
Here we go. There you are. That's right.

455
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,380
I'm not dead.

456
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,380
You're not dead, yes.

457
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,380
They all say that, Ted. They all say that.

458
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,380
Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.

459
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,380
Jerma can't help you now, Ted.

460
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,380
Fucking family.

461
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,380
Come on. I've got a spot picked out for you right here.

462
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:46,380
Come on, Ted. Right this way.

463
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,380
There you go.

464
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:52,739
Shh. I'm going to take good care of you, Ted.

465
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:57,219
Off we go now.

466
01:03:57,219 --> 01:04:01,699
This is the worst I've ever felt in my whole life.

467
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:05,219
What did he fucking do?

468
01:04:05,219 --> 01:04:07,219
Why did he come here?

469
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,719
Fucking haunted by my Uncle Ted.

470
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:11,719
I tried to make amends and shit.

471
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:16,139
I don't even know.

472
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:18,139
I have to go to the bathroom.

473
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:26,780
It's here. Press it.

474
01:04:58,099 --> 01:05:00,599
Jesus.

475
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,719
Holy. Goodness.

476
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:14,980
Okay.

477
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,980
The water's starting to come up over the lip.

478
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:35,590
I don't care.

479
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,590
You know when you have to pee a lot

480
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,590
and it just hurts still.

481
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,590
It hurts. Up here it hurts.

482
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,590
Right here it hurts.

483
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,590
All the way to here. This is killing me.

484
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:47,590
Oh, like I emptied everything

485
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,590
but it's just like this pain now.

486
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:51,590
Are you going to let that go again?

487
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:59,269
Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

488
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:01,269
And I'm going to say a prayer for Ted too

489
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:03,269
because being haunted by somebody

490
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:05,269
is just a very unnerving ass thing.

491
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:10,199
Oh, man.

492
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:18,309
I'm going to write about that in my blog tomorrow.

493
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:22,010
What should I title it?

494
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:26,010
My Uncle Going Through the Great Beyond.

495
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,380
Something like that.

496
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,369
I was fucked up.

497
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:33,369
What did I ever do to that motherfucker?

498
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:35,369
I didn't do anything.

499
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:38,699
I got money in the mail from him. That's it.

500
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:40,699
It was just the thing.

501
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:43,510
My mother called me and sold me.

502
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,510
What the fuck?

503
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:47,510
I don't know why I'm getting haunted by him.

504
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:51,349
Thank God he's on the way to the other side.

505
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:54,619
That's ten times better.

506
01:06:54,619 --> 01:07:15,610
A hundred times better.

507
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:17,980
I'm not even fun anymore.

508
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,110
This is a nice watch though.

509
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:24,889
I don't want the clocks to come back.

510
01:07:24,889 --> 01:07:27,260
Please do something.

511
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,260
I don't want the clowns to come back today.

512
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:34,230
Oh, yay!

513
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:42,489
Butterflies, but

514
01:07:42,489 --> 01:07:44,789
they don't want to be caught.

515
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:47,860
They want to be free.

516
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,860
Butterflies don't want to be caught.

517
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:57,849
They want to be free outside.

518
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:06,360
No, I don't want to. Let me see.

519
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,360
There's one over here.

520
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:17,699
Oh, that's a monarch.

521
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:20,260
It's beautiful.

522
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,260
That's beautiful.

523
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:25,079
I think that might be a moth, but it's okay.

524
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:27,079
It sounds like I'm getting hit by a wave.

525
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:29,079
It's like, hold on.

526
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:31,079
That's kind of funny.

527
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:33,079
That's funny I can hear that.

528
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:41,020
That's kind of funny.

529
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,020
I can't move around too much. It's just a microphone.

530
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:48,949
Life fucks up. I'm tired though.

531
01:08:48,949 --> 01:08:50,949
Oh, what's that butterfly?

532
01:08:50,949 --> 01:08:52,949
Oh, I think that's a

533
01:08:52,949 --> 01:08:54,949
green-tailed sparrow back.

534
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:57,449
Wow!

535
01:08:57,449 --> 01:09:00,840
Maybe I should keep him.

536
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,420
Actual psycho?

537
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,420
I'm fucking tired.

538
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,920
Doorbell!

539
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:15,380
I didn't press it.

540
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:25,220
That was fun.

541
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,220
I feel better. No, that's two.

542
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,220
We have 30 minutes or 45 minutes to go before we even do three more.

543
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:40,539
Life and death.

544
01:09:40,539 --> 01:09:44,949
When somebody comes into the world,

545
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:47,130
they're essentially created.

546
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:49,369
And when they're taken away from the world,

547
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:52,119
they are destroyed.

548
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:54,119
So therefore, all of us,

549
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:56,119
at some point during our lives,

550
01:09:56,119 --> 01:09:58,119
witness creation and destruction

551
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:02,329
in one life.

552
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:05,340
It's crazy to think about that.

553
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,340
And also, like, in the fact that...

554
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,340
Are we even real?

555
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,899
Is this a simulation?

556
01:10:11,899 --> 01:10:13,899
Like, this is a simulation.

557
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:15,899
But is this a simulation inside of a simulation?

558
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:18,579
Could we in fact

559
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:20,579
wake up from this simulation

560
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:23,270
into another simulation?

561
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:28,460
Because we're doing it now!

562
01:10:28,460 --> 01:17:34,170
Oh.

563
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:43,180
Have I eaten? When was the last time I ate?

564
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:46,939
I don't know. Fuck it.

565
01:17:46,939 --> 01:17:53,060
I'm not ready.

566
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:59,000
I don't know.

567
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,930
I'm hungry as shit.

568
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,930
This is not a bad couch. Where did I get this from?

569
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:08,359
Oh, that's right.

570
01:18:08,359 --> 01:18:12,010
Cool. Okay.

571
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:17,300
Oh. This isn't really good.

572
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,300
Unbranded beer.

573
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:31,899
I'm hungry.

574
01:18:31,899 --> 01:18:33,899
I feel like I've got, like, a stomach ache, too. I don't know why.

575
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:42,409
When was the last time I ate?

576
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:01,500
What is it? Mystery?

577
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,489
Mystery box? Ow.

578
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,489
A mystery? Please handle with care.

579
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:08,489
Do not drop.

580
01:19:08,489 --> 01:19:11,750
Something fragile in here?

581
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:16,039
Well, if it's fragile,

582
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:18,789
I don't want to mess with it.

583
01:19:18,789 --> 01:19:20,789
This is pretty cool, though.

584
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:22,789
I would assume my fun meter is high!

585
01:19:22,789 --> 01:19:33,399
These fucking stools.

586
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:37,750
Is there anything else in here?

587
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:39,750
There's a lot of paper in here.

588
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,750
But there...

589
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:45,270
Oh, this is a lot.

590
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:47,270
You know, can I say something real quick?

591
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:49,270
Real quick.

592
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:51,699
The amount of packing material

593
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:53,699
that people put into boxes

594
01:19:53,699 --> 01:19:55,699
is getting a little ridiculous, okay?

595
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:57,699
I have ordered CDs before

596
01:19:57,699 --> 01:19:59,699
that have come in a box

597
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:01,699
this big

598
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:03,699
that have this much packing material

599
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:05,699
and then what am I as the

600
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:11,270
consumer to do about it?

601
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,270
You can literally, like, throw a fucking CD

602
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:15,270
into the wall and it's gonna be fine.

603
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,270
You don't have to put, like, 600 fucking pounds

604
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,270
of paper in here.

605
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:32,119
Hold on.

606
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:35,689
Stool!

607
01:20:35,689 --> 01:20:56,939
Cereal. I'll take some cereal.

608
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:05,130
That sounds good to me.

609
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:12,489
I'm not cutting a tomato.

610
01:21:12,489 --> 01:21:14,489
That's me pouring a soda.

611
01:21:14,489 --> 01:21:17,239
Oh, this is

612
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:20,119
liquid cereal.

613
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:22,550
Do I have any utensils?

614
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,550
Oh, I'm starving, though.

615
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:34,090
Thank goodness.

616
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:37,670
What was that?

617
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:40,100
I have a good thing I've eaten.

618
01:21:40,100 --> 01:22:06,779
Real quick.

619
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:09,340
Hello. Uncle Ted is dead.

620
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:13,239
Is this from the insurance company?

621
01:22:13,239 --> 01:22:16,439
What? Didn't Uncle Ted die, like,

622
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:19,699
three days ago? Two days ago?

623
01:22:19,699 --> 01:22:23,289
What do you mean? My mother called me and said

624
01:22:23,289 --> 01:22:27,130
I got $2,000

625
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:30,390
added to my account.

626
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:32,390
But I thought that, I thought, what, is this, like, just litigation

627
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,390
stuff? Like, I got it, like, a week,

628
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:37,460
two, three weeks later or something?

629
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,460
No, he's confirmed dead yesterday.

630
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:45,020
Oh. Okay.

631
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:47,510
Interesting. Thank you for the, uh,

632
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,510
thank you for the reply and thank you for the, thanks for the email.

633
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:55,260
What?

634
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,260
I was in smack-a-roos, though. I'll take that one.

635
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:01,029
Is he dead? What?

636
01:23:01,029 --> 01:23:04,229
I thought he died.

637
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,229
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.

638
01:23:06,229 --> 01:23:10,840
The cereal's actually pretty good.

639
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:18,779
Close to the door. No, I don't

640
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:20,779
eat on site. This is the only food that they give me.

641
01:23:20,779 --> 01:23:31,020
Okay, can I sell this

642
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:38,380
watch?

643
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:48,810
I don't want to leave trash around. That's better.

644
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:51,819
I need to put a trash barrel. Put a trash can

645
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:54,180
in there. Why are the people

646
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:56,810
just at my house?

647
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:58,810
Stop coming to my house.

648
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:02,140
I haven't eaten breakfast.

649
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:07,449
Oh, my God. All right. Who is that?

650
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:13,850
Hi.

651
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,850
I'm Edna, by the way, your neighbor.

652
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:20,329
What are you doing here? You'll have to

653
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:22,329
forgive me. I was busy

654
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:24,329
with my cat sweater yesterday,

655
01:24:24,329 --> 01:24:26,329
but this is for you.

656
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:28,329
Welcome to the neighborhood.

657
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,329
Thank you. Welcome to the neighborhood.

658
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:32,329
Let's see the house.

659
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:34,500
Oh, my.

660
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,500
Oh, wow.

661
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,500
You've really done nothing with the place.

662
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,500
Okay.

663
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,500
Is this what you kids

664
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,500
call a house these days?

665
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,500
Thank you.

666
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,500
Is this a basket?

667
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,500
I'll take that back later, but you put

668
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,500
that wherever you'd like. That's for you.

669
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,500
There are apples. There's fresh fruit in here.

670
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,500
Yes, that's from the farmers

671
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,500
market. It's a stone's throw away.

672
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,500
If you ever get hungry,

673
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,500
you can go down there.

674
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,500
There's no worms.

675
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,500
It's a very big mix. My cat is the

676
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,500
one with worms, but there's no worms

677
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,500
in the apples. I can't have any of these.

678
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,500
No, those are for you.

679
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,500
But you're taking the basket.

680
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,500
Yes, it's my basket.

681
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,500
My first grandchild

682
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,500
was born, and we brought it home

683
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,500
in that basket.

684
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,500
That's really fantastic.

685
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,500
What's your name again?

686
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,500
Edna. What is this?

687
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,500
The placement's a little odd, but

688
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,500
you can sit down if you want to. In your kitchen.

689
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,500
I just moved in.

690
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,500
It was really nice to see you, though.

691
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,500
Have you seen these spoons?

692
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,500
Yes, I have seen those spoons.

693
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,500
My Uncle Ted left me those spoons.

694
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,500
Did they come with your uncle who?

695
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,500
My Uncle Ted left me those spoons.

696
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,500
You wet the bed? Okay.

697
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,500
That happens sometimes.

698
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,500
People wet the bed. It's perfectly normal.

699
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,500
Don't worry about that.

700
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,500
Yeah, sometimes they do.

701
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,500
They're under the age of six.

702
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,500
I'm a 35-year-old man.

703
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,500
How old are you?

704
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,500
I'm 35.

705
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,500
Okay, you look more like a 15

706
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,500
with those gloves, but that's

707
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,500
all right.

708
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,500
Do you mind if I sit down?

709
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:20,250
Please do, please.

710
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,250
No.

711
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,250
Oh, my.

712
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,250
I just have a bad migraine.

713
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:29,060
I'm okay.

714
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,060
You look lovely.

715
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,060
Thank you, sweetheart.

716
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,060
I do my own makeup and my own hair.

717
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,060
I've never seen in my life.

718
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,060
Well, sweetheart, I'm sorry, but

719
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,060
I'm taken.

720
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:43,060
I've been married for 45 years.

721
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,060
That's excellent.

722
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,060
Do you have

723
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,060
a stool by chance

724
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,060
for me to put my feet up?

725
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,060
No, not yet.

726
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,060
It's kind of an interesting scenario that I have here

727
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:57,060
in this particular house.

728
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:59,060
I mean, you can put your feet up there if you want.

729
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,060
It's too high. The blood flow.

730
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,060
It's too high.

731
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,060
How old are you?

732
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:07,060
You shouldn't ask

733
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,060
a lady that question.

734
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,060
That's probably a bad idea.

735
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,060
You ruined it.

736
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:15,689
Do you have food?

737
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:17,689
I do. I actually do have food.

738
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:19,689
Do you have bread?

739
01:27:19,689 --> 01:27:21,689
I got lots of bread. Do you like bread?

740
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:23,689
Not really, no.

741
01:27:23,689 --> 01:27:25,689
I don't like bread, but

742
01:27:25,689 --> 01:27:27,689
a house isn't really a home without food.

743
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,060
I've got bread. I mean, I do live

744
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,060
like a 20-year-old that's in a dorm room,

745
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,060
but I have peanut butter, I have cereal,

746
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,060
I have mac and cheese, I've got bread.

747
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,060
Oh, sweetheart. Why don't we

748
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:42,060
whip something up really quick?

749
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,060
Maybe in a few days or something.

750
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,060
No, right now. Why don't you

751
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,060
be a doll?

752
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,060
I've got some stuff going on, but I'm not sure.

753
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,060
I'm sorry, that might be me.

754
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:54,060
That's you.

755
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,060
Don't worry about that. Hold on.

756
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,060
I have a lot of nice people who call me.

757
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:00,229
Okay, yeah.

758
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:02,229
I can get some food ready if you want.

759
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:04,920
I've got peanut butter, you know, I've got everything.

760
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,420
Hello, this is Edna.

761
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,039
Yes.

762
01:28:10,039 --> 01:28:13,180
My social security number.

763
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:15,739
Okay.

764
01:28:15,739 --> 01:28:17,739
I can give that to you if you want.

765
01:28:17,739 --> 01:28:19,739
That's fine.

766
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:21,739
What are you doing? Yeah, so my social security number

767
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:23,739
No, don't do that. Don't do that.

768
01:28:23,739 --> 01:28:25,739
Wait, wait, wait. Is that a family member?

769
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:27,739
Is that a family member?

770
01:28:27,739 --> 01:28:29,739
My family wants to talk to you.

771
01:28:29,739 --> 01:28:31,739
Is that a family member? Oh, no, no.

772
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:33,739
He's from the social security department.

773
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:35,739
He's from the social security department?

774
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:37,739
Yeah, yeah. Are you a family member?

775
01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:40,869
Did he hang up on you?

776
01:28:40,869 --> 01:28:42,869
They hung up. He'll call back.

777
01:28:42,869 --> 01:28:44,869
He's a real sweet guy. Was that like a son

778
01:28:44,869 --> 01:28:46,869
or a grandson?

779
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:48,869
No, there's a little bit of a mix-up.

780
01:28:48,869 --> 01:28:50,869
I left my car on the south border

781
01:28:50,869 --> 01:28:52,869
of Texas, but it's a whole

782
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,869
thing. Don't worry about it.

783
01:28:54,869 --> 01:28:56,869
I wouldn't give your social security number

784
01:28:56,869 --> 01:28:58,869
to people you don't know.

785
01:28:58,869 --> 01:29:00,869
Will you be a sweetheart and get me some

786
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:02,869
flour and sugar and eggs and some

787
01:29:02,869 --> 01:29:04,869
mayonnaise and maybe an avocado

788
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:06,869
and a couple of, I don't know, do you have

789
01:29:06,869 --> 01:29:08,869
like a baking sheet or maybe a

790
01:29:08,869 --> 01:29:10,869
pie tin?

791
01:29:10,869 --> 01:29:12,869
I don't think I have any of those things.

792
01:29:12,869 --> 01:29:14,869
You don't have any of those things? I mean, you can take a look.

793
01:29:14,869 --> 01:29:17,109
Okay.

794
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:19,109
Just to make yourself comfortable and maybe we could plan this

795
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:21,109
maybe like in a few days, but not right now.

796
01:29:21,109 --> 01:29:23,109
Oh, no, I'm busy in a few days.

797
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:26,310
Okay.

798
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:28,550
There's not much here,

799
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,550
but. What am I doing?

800
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:33,689
All right.

801
01:29:33,689 --> 01:29:35,689
What, he only eats macaroni?

802
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:39,720
Is that you

803
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,720
or me? I don't know. It sounds like you.

804
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,720
I think it's me again. I need to make a phone call.

805
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,720
Are you getting another call?

806
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,720
How many calls do you get? It's me. It's me.

807
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,720
Well, I'm a very busy woman now, right?

808
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,220
I would change your phone number.

809
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,899
Hello? Yes.

810
01:29:54,899 --> 01:29:56,899
I was telling you

811
01:29:56,899 --> 01:29:58,899
the social security number, right?

812
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:00,899
Yeah. It's

813
01:30:00,899 --> 01:30:03,340
I'm sorry. What was that?

814
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:05,340
Where is my grandson?

815
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:08,220
He's in prison.

816
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:10,220
I want to get more physically fit.

817
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:12,220
I'm quite busy right now.

818
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,220
Some leg routines, something like that.

819
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:16,220
He's in prison? Yeah.

820
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,220
Whatever you cost, it doesn't matter because it's not me paying for it

821
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:20,220
except that it is just bullshit.

822
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,220
How long has he been in prison for?

823
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,220
Okay.

824
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:26,220
What do you need from me?

825
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,220
It's 985. 985 Dollhouse Way.

826
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,220
Is everything okay?

827
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,390
Excellent. We'll see you soon.

828
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:34,569
Okay.

829
01:30:34,569 --> 01:30:36,569
Well, how much money is it exactly?

830
01:30:36,569 --> 01:30:38,569
How much money would you need from me?

831
01:30:38,569 --> 01:30:40,569
Okay, so $10,000

832
01:30:40,569 --> 01:30:42,569
and he gets out of prison. Scott?

833
01:30:42,569 --> 01:30:44,569
Hang the phone up.

834
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:46,569
It's two seconds. Two seconds.

835
01:30:46,569 --> 01:30:48,569
Okay, my wire details.

836
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:50,569
It's a Wells Fargo

837
01:30:50,569 --> 01:30:52,569
or a Chase or whatever.

838
01:30:52,569 --> 01:30:56,579
Hello!

839
01:30:56,579 --> 01:30:58,579
It's time to get

840
01:30:58,579 --> 01:31:00,579
fit.

841
01:31:00,579 --> 01:31:02,579
Those look heavy. Come on in.

842
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:04,579
Get in there and get physical.

843
01:31:04,579 --> 01:31:06,579
Oh, thank you.

844
01:31:06,579 --> 01:31:08,579
Alright.

845
01:31:08,579 --> 01:31:10,579
Upper body?

846
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:12,579
Well, I can tell you how we're going to get you in shape.

847
01:31:12,579 --> 01:31:14,579
Excuse me.

848
01:31:14,579 --> 01:31:16,579
I'm so sorry.

849
01:31:16,579 --> 01:31:18,579
I'll have to call you back.

850
01:31:18,579 --> 01:31:20,579
There's a strange man in the house.

851
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:22,579
Sometimes,

852
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:24,579
my phone calls are most effective.

853
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:26,579
Yes, they are. Hold on a second.

854
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:28,579
Don't take any more phone calls.

855
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:30,579
Well, I would get your phone number.

856
01:31:30,579 --> 01:31:32,579
Go to your store and have your provider

857
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:34,579
and they talk to them about that.

858
01:31:34,579 --> 01:31:36,579
I think you probably shouldn't be answering those calls.

859
01:31:36,579 --> 01:31:38,579
What was your name? Gigi.

860
01:31:38,579 --> 01:31:40,579
This is Gigi.

861
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:42,579
Nice to meet you.

862
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:44,579
So what are we going to do?

863
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:46,579
Some light aerobic exercise.

864
01:31:46,579 --> 01:31:48,579
You can sit down.

865
01:31:48,579 --> 01:31:50,579
I think I'll sit down for this one.

866
01:31:50,579 --> 01:31:52,579
I want you to follow me.

867
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:54,579
Couple of moves. First one.

868
01:31:54,579 --> 01:31:56,579
This sprinkler.

869
01:31:56,579 --> 01:31:58,579
Okay.

870
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:00,579
Hey.

871
01:32:02,579 --> 01:32:04,579
Hey.

872
01:32:04,579 --> 01:32:06,579
That's more movement. More energy.

873
01:32:06,579 --> 01:32:08,579
Come on. But it hurts.

874
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:10,579
I can do this at home.

875
01:32:10,579 --> 01:32:12,579
We're picking items at the supermarket.

876
01:32:12,579 --> 01:32:14,579
We're picking

877
01:32:14,579 --> 01:32:16,579
items. Come on. Get that arm up.

878
01:32:16,579 --> 01:32:18,579
We're picking items at the supermarket.

879
01:32:18,579 --> 01:32:20,579
We're picking items at the supermarket.

880
01:32:20,579 --> 01:32:22,579
We're swimming in the pool.

881
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,579
We're swimming in the pool.

882
01:32:24,579 --> 01:32:26,579
Are you feeling strong?

883
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:28,579
You look strong. Do you feel good?

884
01:32:28,579 --> 01:32:30,579
Don't do those. I don't want to be

885
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:32,579
responsible if something happens to you.

886
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:34,579
I don't want to be responsible if something happens to you.

887
01:32:34,579 --> 01:32:36,579
Just relax and don't take any more phone calls.

888
01:32:36,579 --> 01:32:38,579
How do you feel?

889
01:32:38,579 --> 01:32:40,579
I'm lightening up a little bit.

890
01:32:40,579 --> 01:32:42,579
How much are these? How much weight are these?

891
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:44,579
Those are five pounds each.

892
01:32:44,579 --> 01:32:46,579
Careful now. You don't want to hurt yourself.

893
01:32:46,579 --> 01:32:48,579
We're yummy mummies

894
01:32:48,579 --> 01:32:50,579
looking to be tight in the tummies.

895
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:52,579
You got it.

896
01:32:52,579 --> 01:32:54,579
Those are like 60. You might need a sparr.

897
01:32:54,579 --> 01:32:56,579
But you're looking good.

898
01:32:56,579 --> 01:32:58,579
I wanted to drop those off. It's a welcoming

899
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:00,579
gift for you. Thank you.

900
01:33:00,579 --> 01:33:02,579
You look great. Thank you. It actually feels

901
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:04,579
pretty good. You ever want to go out for like a 60

902
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,579
mile run? You just let me know, okay? Never.

903
01:33:06,579 --> 01:33:08,579
You'll never get that phone call. Alright, I'll come back

904
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:10,579
tomorrow morning. Excellent. So are you going to leave these here?

905
01:33:10,579 --> 01:33:12,579
Well, would you like them? I would

906
01:33:12,579 --> 01:33:14,579
love these. That would be fantastic.

907
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:16,579
They're so sweet of you.

908
01:33:16,579 --> 01:33:18,579
How much was that?

909
01:33:18,579 --> 01:33:20,579
Do you need a credit card? No, that's okay.

910
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:22,579
Listen, we're coming back for a workout tomorrow.

911
01:33:22,579 --> 01:33:24,579
Alright.

912
01:33:24,579 --> 01:33:26,579
Get out of here.

913
01:33:26,579 --> 01:33:28,579
Okay, bye.

914
01:33:28,579 --> 01:33:30,579
That was a very strong workout.

915
01:33:32,579 --> 01:33:34,579
That cost $200.

916
01:33:34,579 --> 01:33:36,579
So what was your name?

917
01:33:36,579 --> 01:33:39,079
What was your name again?

918
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:41,079
My name is Jirba.

919
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:43,079
And you have children? I don't have

920
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:45,770
kids. Why?

921
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:47,770
Why don't you have children? It just didn't work

922
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:49,770
out. I've just been trying to focus on my career.

923
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:51,770
Okay, and what's that? You have a job?

924
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:53,770
Yeah. Most of your kids don't have jobs

925
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:55,770
these days. You go to work regularly?

926
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:57,770
I don't get in a car

927
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,770
to go to work, but I go in front of a screen.

928
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,770
Alright, very interesting.

929
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:03,770
I'm sorry, what was that? I get

930
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:05,770
in front of a screen. It's almost like a car. Like I have like a mouse

931
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:07,770
and keyboard and I sit in front of a computer.

932
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:09,770
What does that mean? That sounds like you made up

933
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,770
a job. No,

934
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:13,770
I get in front of a computer and I talk

935
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:15,770
and I hang out with people and I chat with them and it's like we chat

936
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:17,770
and we're cool and everything's cool.

937
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,770
You don't have to make up a job to appease

938
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:21,770
me, sweetheart. I still

939
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:23,770
also care about you. And I'm a plumber.

940
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:25,770
Oh, see the trades

941
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:27,770
are a very beautiful job. Yeah, that's very

942
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:29,770
difficult. That's exactly what people need

943
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:31,770
in today's world. It's

944
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:33,770
plumbing, I go into the sinks.

945
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:35,770
Well, I tell you what, I'd like

946
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,770
you to, really quickly if you

947
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:39,770
don't mind, could you point me

948
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:41,770
to your bathroom? The bathroom's right in the

949
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:43,770
storage over here. Okay, I have a weak bladder

950
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:45,770
so just give me two. Well, so do I, but

951
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:47,770
apparently they don't want to take care of it. Oh, that's not bad

952
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:49,770
at your age.

953
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:51,770
Alright, she was talking about getting flour.

954
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,770
Yes, flour,

955
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:55,770
a whole package of eggs,

956
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:57,770
avocado, if you have

957
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:59,770
anything like noodles, salami,

958
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:01,770
anything like that.

959
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:03,770
Excuse me.

960
01:35:10,859 --> 01:35:14,949
Oh my. Look, he's just like Jimmy Fallon.

961
01:35:14,949 --> 01:35:16,949
He just like breaks it every time.

962
01:35:16,949 --> 01:35:21,300
Oh, a stool.

963
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:23,539
Okay.

964
01:35:23,539 --> 01:35:25,539
I need to get the flour ready.

965
01:35:25,539 --> 01:35:27,539
And

966
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:30,859
I need to

967
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:32,859
get flour.

968
01:35:32,859 --> 01:35:34,859
And

969
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:41,130
Okay.

970
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:43,130
Easy does it.

971
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,619
I'm a little

972
01:35:45,619 --> 01:35:47,619
deeper.

973
01:35:47,619 --> 01:35:49,619
Edna, are you in there?

974
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,619
What was that?

975
01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:53,619
Would you like to dance,

976
01:35:53,619 --> 01:35:55,619
Edna? It's a weird request,

977
01:35:55,619 --> 01:35:57,619
but would you like to dance?

978
01:35:57,619 --> 01:35:59,619
Okay, hold on.

979
01:35:59,619 --> 01:36:01,619
Edna, come on, if you want to come on out here.

980
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:08,539
Would you like to dance?

981
01:36:08,539 --> 01:36:10,539
Would you like to dance?

982
01:36:10,539 --> 01:36:12,539
Would you love to dance?

983
01:36:12,539 --> 01:36:14,539
Okay, let's go ahead and do this.

984
01:36:14,539 --> 01:36:16,539
Okay, I don't know what that means.

985
01:36:16,539 --> 01:36:22,359
My throat was a little weird.

986
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:24,359
You remind me of my husband

987
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:26,359
when he was younger,

988
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:30,069
before he passed away.

989
01:36:30,069 --> 01:36:35,699
Yeah, you spin me around.

990
01:36:35,699 --> 01:36:37,699
Just like

991
01:36:37,699 --> 01:36:39,699
Thank you.

992
01:36:39,699 --> 01:36:41,699
We lock it in our locket fingers.

993
01:36:41,699 --> 01:36:44,520
Why are we dancing for?

994
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:47,140
Because I'm very tired.

995
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:54,760
Please let go.

996
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:56,760
I'm trying to let go.

997
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,760
Okay.

998
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,060
Into the kitchen, if you would.

999
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:03,060
Into the kitchen.

1000
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:11,960
Are you coming in here?

1001
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,960
I'm coming in here.

1002
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,960
Listen, I'm a firm believer

1003
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,960
that a house isn't a home without cookies.

1004
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,960
Yeah.

1005
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,960
Can I give you

1006
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,960
my mother's famous recipe for cookies?

1007
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,960
Edna, did you wash your hands?

1008
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,960
I never wash my hands.

1009
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,960
You kids don't understand. I have a very good immune system.

1010
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:33,350
Very good.

1011
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:35,350
Okay.

1012
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,350
No, that's okay.

1013
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:39,350
If we're going to make food, then you should...

1014
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:41,350
You'll do all the work, sweetie.

1015
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:43,350
It's all in the feeling. You have to feel this.

1016
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:45,350
Okay, flour, sugar, eggs.

1017
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:47,350
What are we making?

1018
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:49,350
Cookies.

1019
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:51,350
What kind of cookies?

1020
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:53,350
Water.

1021
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:55,350
Eggs are in there, if you want to grab them.

1022
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:57,350
What kind of eggs are these?

1023
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:59,350
Those are free-range eggs.

1024
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,350
What does free-range mean?

1025
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,350
I don't know, I just pretend to know.

1026
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:05,350
Okay.

1027
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:07,350
I think that means the chickens are going to walk around.

1028
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:09,350
Okay, we'll need all of these.

1029
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:11,350
Is that all right?

1030
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:13,350
All of them?

1031
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:15,350
At least most of them, yeah.

1032
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:17,350
We can use a few of them.

1033
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,350
How much sugar?

1034
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:21,350
Okay, sprinkle it all in there.

1035
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:23,350
This is to make cookie dough?

1036
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:25,350
Yes, go ahead. Just give it a couple of good shakes.

1037
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:27,350
Put it all in there.

1038
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:29,350
All the flour?

1039
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:31,350
Well, I mean most of it.

1040
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:33,350
That's good.

1041
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:35,350
A little more.

1042
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:37,350
A little bit more.

1043
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:39,350
Okay, eyeball it. Does that seem good?

1044
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:41,350
I've never made cookies in my entire life.

1045
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:43,350
You've never made cookies?

1046
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,350
That looks great.

1047
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:47,350
You want to wiggle it around a little, see if there's any lumps in there.

1048
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:49,350
You're fine.

1049
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:51,350
I don't see any.

1050
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:53,350
Okay, now dump all the sugar in it. People like sugar.

1051
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:56,619
I like sugar, it's good.

1052
01:38:56,619 --> 01:38:58,619
And this is just how my mother used to make these.

1053
01:38:58,619 --> 01:39:00,619
They're very simple.

1054
01:39:00,619 --> 01:39:02,619
I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on, it's kind of hard to open.

1055
01:39:02,619 --> 01:39:04,619
I don't know why you kids do things like that.

1056
01:39:04,619 --> 01:39:06,619
It's just like...

1057
01:39:06,619 --> 01:39:08,619
Where did you get these spoons, by the way?

1058
01:39:08,619 --> 01:39:10,619
Those were left by my uncle Ted.

1059
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:12,619
Okay.

1060
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:14,619
Who recently passed away.

1061
01:39:14,619 --> 01:39:16,619
Can I have them?

1062
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:18,619
That smells so bad.

1063
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,619
Can I have those spoons?

1064
01:39:20,619 --> 01:39:22,619
Can you have them?

1065
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:24,619
Yeah, I mean, you don't use them, right? Obviously.

1066
01:39:24,619 --> 01:39:26,619
Well, I mean, they were left from my uncle Ted,

1067
01:39:26,619 --> 01:39:28,619
who recently passed away, so I don't think that's appropriate.

1068
01:39:28,619 --> 01:39:30,619
You need help with that, or you got it?

1069
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:32,619
I'm just going to open the top, because I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on,

1070
01:39:32,619 --> 01:39:34,619
because somebody decided I was going to put Mickey Mouse gloves on

1071
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:36,619
and wear them the entire day.

1072
01:39:36,619 --> 01:39:38,619
Well, you're your own person, you get to make your own choices.

1073
01:39:38,619 --> 01:39:40,619
How much sugar goes in here, Edna?

1074
01:39:40,619 --> 01:39:42,619
The whole thing.

1075
01:39:42,619 --> 01:39:47,479
The whole thing goes right in there.

1076
01:39:47,479 --> 01:39:49,479
Perfect, that's perfect.

1077
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:51,479
Okay, so that looks good?

1078
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:53,479
Okay, yeah, now what I want you to do is I want you to crack

1079
01:39:53,479 --> 01:39:55,479
two or three eggs into that pitcher.

1080
01:39:55,479 --> 01:39:57,479
Okay. Two or three of them?

1081
01:39:57,479 --> 01:39:59,479
Two or three.

1082
01:39:59,479 --> 01:40:01,479
Whatever you're feeling today, do you want to be extra moist cookies?

1083
01:40:01,479 --> 01:40:03,479
Is there a recipe, or are you just doing this?

1084
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:05,479
No, it's all in your heart, honey.

1085
01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:07,479
But is it...

1086
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:09,479
I don't know what that means, Edna.

1087
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:11,479
How many eggs do you think would be best?

1088
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:13,479
If you're always on a quiz show, and you told me how many eggs,

1089
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:15,479
I would say probably like four.

1090
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:17,479
Then put four eggs in, and if it's terrible,

1091
01:40:17,479 --> 01:40:19,479
we'll make it again, that's fine.

1092
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:25,430
Honey, oh, you've got to do better than that.

1093
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:32,630
We've made a good decision here, that's for sure.

1094
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:36,020
Oh, these gloves are coming off!

1095
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:38,020
Hey, Edna, how about two?

1096
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:40,020
Yeah, you know what, I think it'll be great with...

1097
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:42,020
Even one egg is perfect.

1098
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:44,020
You know, back in the war, when I was younger,

1099
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:46,020
we used to have to ration,

1100
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,020
and we could make one egg go a long way.

1101
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:50,020
You know what, in the gift basket,

1102
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:52,020
I brought over some applesauce.

1103
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,020
Applesauce?

1104
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:56,020
This is applesauce.

1105
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:58,020
Edna, these are mint chocolates.

1106
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:00,020
Well, if you boil them up,

1107
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:02,020
it'll be a similar consistency.

1108
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:04,020
I mean, we'll roll with it.

1109
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:06,020
We'll roll with it.

1110
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:08,020
Okay, so boil these...

1111
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,020
No, forget it, okay, take this.

1112
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,020
Here, you're fine, you're fine.

1113
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:14,020
Okay, well, I need a stirrer.

1114
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:16,020
Do you have water?

1115
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:18,020
I do have water, it's right here.

1116
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:20,020
Take a little bit of water.

1117
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:22,020
It's fine.

1118
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:24,020
So what is this going to make, Edna?

1119
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,020
They used to say two spoons of sugar

1120
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:28,020
would make the medicine go down.

1121
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:30,020
In this case, you have a whole box.

1122
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:32,020
So it'll taste very good.

1123
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,020
That smell you're smelling, by the way,

1124
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,020
is probably the eggs and the sugar combined.

1125
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:38,020
It's probably filling the room.

1126
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:40,020
I can't smell anything.

1127
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:42,020
Thank God.

1128
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:44,520
So how much water, just a little bit of water?

1129
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,520
Okay.

1130
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,520
Do I mix this?

1131
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,520
What kind of cookies?

1132
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,520
Really put your arms back into it.

1133
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,520
No, like really work.

1134
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,699
I want to see you actually working.

1135
01:41:56,699 --> 01:41:58,699
Okay.

1136
01:41:58,699 --> 01:42:00,699
It's good for you kids to work.

1137
01:42:00,699 --> 01:42:02,699
You've got elbow grease, we used to call it.

1138
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:04,699
And this is sugar flour and egg,

1139
01:42:04,699 --> 01:42:06,699
and it's going to make...

1140
01:42:06,699 --> 01:42:08,699
Pecan sandies.

1141
01:42:08,699 --> 01:42:10,699
My mother's recipe.

1142
01:42:10,699 --> 01:42:12,699
Those are actually my least favorite cookie in the world.

1143
01:42:12,699 --> 01:42:14,699
Say that.

1144
01:42:14,699 --> 01:42:16,699
Because when you bite into them, it tastes like you're taking a bite of the beach on the ground

1145
01:42:16,699 --> 01:42:18,699
and it's like sandy, and it feels like gritty.

1146
01:42:18,699 --> 01:42:20,699
So you don't want extra pecans then?

1147
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:22,699
Edna, when I take a bite out of a pecan sandy,

1148
01:42:22,699 --> 01:42:24,699
I feel like there's sand in my underwear from the beach.

1149
01:42:24,699 --> 01:42:26,699
You don't like that?

1150
01:42:26,699 --> 01:42:28,699
I mean, I don't hate them.

1151
01:42:28,699 --> 01:42:32,149
I thought that's why some people went to the beach.

1152
01:42:32,149 --> 01:42:34,149
I've got it all wrong, I guess.

1153
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:36,649
Okay.

1154
01:42:36,649 --> 01:42:39,460
Are you really tired after that?

1155
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:41,460
I mean, it's work, Edna.

1156
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,460
Look at this, look at how much muscle I'm putting into this.

1157
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,460
I just don't understand.

1158
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,460
All right, that's good.

1159
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:49,460
Is that good? Can we see? Is that good?

1160
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:51,460
Do you mind for two seconds?

1161
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,460
I have to make a quick phone call if you don't mind.

1162
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,460
No, fine, that's fine.

1163
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,460
You put it in the oven.

1164
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:59,460
That's an oven-proof bowl, I'm pretty sure.

1165
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:01,460
Okay.

1166
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:03,460
Edna, this is plastic.

1167
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:05,899
Can I actually use your phone?

1168
01:43:05,899 --> 01:43:07,899
Edna, before you go in there, I need to take a shower real quick.

1169
01:43:07,899 --> 01:43:09,899
Oh.

1170
01:43:09,899 --> 01:43:11,899
You can get on the phone.

1171
01:43:11,899 --> 01:43:13,899
Okay, I'll make a quick call.

1172
01:43:13,899 --> 01:43:15,899
I just need to take a quick shower.

1173
01:43:15,899 --> 01:43:17,899
All right, you're fine.

1174
01:43:17,899 --> 01:43:20,649
Let me get these in the oven.

1175
01:43:20,649 --> 01:43:22,649
Is it going to be pecan sandies?

1176
01:43:22,649 --> 01:43:24,649
Yeah, put it in there for like 20 minutes.

1177
01:43:24,649 --> 01:43:26,649
Okay, so 20 minutes.

1178
01:43:26,649 --> 01:43:28,649
Doesn't that seem kind of long?

1179
01:43:28,649 --> 01:43:30,649
Is it okay if the utensil's in there?

1180
01:43:30,649 --> 01:43:32,649
Okay, I'm going to take a shower.

1181
01:43:32,649 --> 01:43:35,140
I'm so sorry, if you smell something, it's not me.

1182
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:39,750
I'm going to get fucking rid of this lady.

1183
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:44,939
A neighbor?

1184
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:47,930
What the fuck?

1185
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:49,930
She just won't leave.

1186
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:51,930
There's really nothing in this house.

1187
01:43:57,619 --> 01:44:12,899
So much better.

1188
01:44:12,899 --> 01:44:15,460
I think I'm just going to piss.

1189
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:18,149
I'm just pissing right now.

1190
01:44:18,149 --> 01:44:20,149
Well, when the water was off, the water's off now.

1191
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:22,149
I want to pee now.

1192
01:44:22,149 --> 01:44:24,149
Turn the water back on.

1193
01:44:24,149 --> 01:44:26,149
Turn the water back on.

1194
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:28,149
You don't just pee into an empty shower.

1195
01:44:28,149 --> 01:44:31,609
You pee when your shower's running.

1196
01:44:31,609 --> 01:44:33,609
Everyone does it.

1197
01:44:33,609 --> 01:44:35,609
And you can pretend like you don't.

1198
01:44:35,609 --> 01:44:38,619
I know you do.

1199
01:44:38,619 --> 01:44:47,500
I feel better.

1200
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,500
Sweetie, are you there?

1201
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,500
I would wash my hands, but...

1202
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,500
What was your name again?

1203
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,500
Justin?

1204
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,500
Justin, are you there?

1205
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:02,229
Justin?

1206
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:06,229
You don't by chance have nitroglycerin pills or anything, do you?

1207
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:08,229
I don't.

1208
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:10,229
What was it?

1209
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:12,229
No medicine at all.

1210
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:14,229
I've got acetaminophen, I've got ibuprofen.

1211
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:16,229
It's fine. The cookies are probably done by now.

1212
01:45:16,229 --> 01:45:18,229
The cookies are done?

1213
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:20,229
I already sprinkled the pecan in there.

1214
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:22,229
You put the pecans in? Thank you.

1215
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:26,649
Appreciate it.

1216
01:45:28,649 --> 01:45:30,649
They smell heavenly.

1217
01:45:30,649 --> 01:45:32,649
They do smell fantastic.

1218
01:45:32,649 --> 01:45:34,649
That's strange.

1219
01:45:34,649 --> 01:45:36,649
Just like my mother used to make them.

1220
01:45:36,649 --> 01:45:38,649
Well, open it up.

1221
01:45:38,649 --> 01:45:40,649
Let's see. How does it look?

1222
01:45:40,649 --> 01:45:42,649
The fruits of your labor.

1223
01:45:42,649 --> 01:45:44,649
It's the fruits of our labor.

1224
01:45:44,649 --> 01:45:46,649
I'm curious.

1225
01:45:46,649 --> 01:45:48,649
I think the plastic from the bowl

1226
01:45:48,649 --> 01:45:50,649
must have transitioned into this.

1227
01:45:50,649 --> 01:45:52,649
Is that the recipe?

1228
01:45:52,649 --> 01:45:54,649
That happens. It's called osmosis.

1229
01:45:54,649 --> 01:45:56,649
If you would have gone to school, you would have learned.

1230
01:45:56,649 --> 01:45:58,649
Edna, could you get one for me?

1231
01:45:58,649 --> 01:46:00,649
I have raw egg all over my hands

1232
01:46:00,649 --> 01:46:03,210
and I don't want to get salmonella.

1233
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:05,640
You met my grandchildren.

1234
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,640
Salmonella?

1235
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:09,640
I've got a thing in my throat.

1236
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,640
My twin granddaughters, salmonella, did they come by?

1237
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,640
No.

1238
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,640
Food?

1239
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:17,640
They love these. I make them for them.

1240
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:21,289
They're very good. Can I try?

1241
01:46:21,289 --> 01:46:30,380
Would you like one?

1242
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:32,380
You can keep these, all right?

1243
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:40,489
Just like sand at the beach.

1244
01:46:40,489 --> 01:46:42,489
I feel sand all up in my underwear.

1245
01:46:44,489 --> 01:46:46,489
It's fantastic. It feels great.

1246
01:46:46,489 --> 01:46:48,489
You look like you're loving it.

1247
01:46:48,489 --> 01:46:50,489
I was probably at the beach at some point.

1248
01:46:50,489 --> 01:46:52,729
These are fantastic.

1249
01:46:52,729 --> 01:46:54,729
I know.

1250
01:46:54,729 --> 01:46:56,729
You just have to feel it.

1251
01:46:56,729 --> 01:46:58,729
Anytime you want to make food, I swear,

1252
01:46:58,729 --> 01:47:00,729
just put the stuff in there.

1253
01:47:00,729 --> 01:47:02,729
It's been about seven or eight hours

1254
01:47:02,729 --> 01:47:04,729
since you've showed up.

1255
01:47:04,729 --> 01:47:06,729
Where do you live?

1256
01:47:06,729 --> 01:47:08,729
Do you need help getting home?

1257
01:47:08,729 --> 01:47:10,729
I usually get lost, but someone will call me

1258
01:47:10,729 --> 01:47:12,729
and I'll have to go down to the police department

1259
01:47:12,729 --> 01:47:14,729
or the bank or something like that.

1260
01:47:14,729 --> 01:47:16,729
It will be fine.

1261
01:47:16,729 --> 01:47:18,729
Do you live in the neighborhood?

1262
01:47:18,729 --> 01:47:20,729
Yes, you don't have a car.

1263
01:47:20,729 --> 01:47:22,729
I could point you to where your house is.

1264
01:47:22,729 --> 01:47:24,729
It's somewhere around that way.

1265
01:47:26,729 --> 01:47:28,729
It's getting late. I'm getting really tired.

1266
01:47:28,729 --> 01:47:30,729
I need the gift basket back.

1267
01:47:30,729 --> 01:47:32,729
Could I have an apple?

1268
01:47:32,729 --> 01:47:34,729
Sure.

1269
01:47:34,729 --> 01:47:36,729
It's a very beautiful apple

1270
01:47:36,729 --> 01:47:38,729
that you've given me.

1271
01:47:38,729 --> 01:47:40,729
If there's anything you ever need,

1272
01:47:40,729 --> 01:47:42,729
I know a lot of people.

1273
01:47:42,729 --> 01:47:44,729
Especially if you have computer problems,

1274
01:47:44,729 --> 01:47:46,729
you let me know, sweetheart.

1275
01:47:46,729 --> 01:47:48,729
I wouldn't answer the phone

1276
01:47:48,729 --> 01:47:50,729
for very many people anymore.

1277
01:47:50,729 --> 01:47:52,729
I have plenty of time.

1278
01:47:52,729 --> 01:47:54,729
It was nice to meet you.

1279
01:47:54,729 --> 01:47:56,729
It was a wonderful meeting.

1280
01:47:56,729 --> 01:47:58,729
Maybe I'll see you again. It was fantastic.

1281
01:47:58,729 --> 01:48:00,729
Thank you for the recipe and everything.

1282
01:48:00,729 --> 01:48:02,729
Absolutely.

1283
01:48:02,729 --> 01:48:04,729
I'm exhausted.

1284
01:48:04,729 --> 01:48:06,729
I hope she gets home okay.

1285
01:48:06,729 --> 01:48:09,930
Is she going to get home okay?

1286
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:12,550
Should I make sure she's okay?

1287
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:15,750
She said she doesn't even know if she really lives.

1288
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:17,750
I have no idea. Should I make sure she's alright?

1289
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:21,899
I don't know.

1290
01:48:21,899 --> 01:48:25,289
That was an interesting day.

1291
01:48:25,289 --> 01:48:32,380
She's here all day.

1292
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,380
I'm just trying to be nice.

1293
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,380
I'm not trying to get rid of an old lady or something.

1294
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:38,380
You're here all day.

1295
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:43,109
I got the fitness instructor here.

1296
01:48:43,109 --> 01:48:45,109
I feel a little tighter.

1297
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:47,350
I also feel like...

1298
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:50,039
And we're doing this now, apparently.

1299
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:52,470
I'm going to do this into the bedroom

1300
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:54,470
because I'm not fucking leaving the floor again.

1301
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:56,470
I'm just going to sleep on the floor.

1302
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:58,470
I'm just going to sleep on the floor.

1303
01:56:43,979 --> 01:56:49,289
No. No thanks.

1304
01:56:49,289 --> 01:56:59,640
Ow.

1305
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:05,960
What's today?

1306
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:09,289
Saturday? Thursday?

1307
01:57:09,289 --> 01:57:12,680
Tuesday? I don't know.

1308
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,680
Do I have something to do today? No, I don't know.

1309
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:19,100
I think three or four people are going to call me.

1310
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:22,729
They're going to have a meeting.

1311
01:57:22,729 --> 01:57:24,729
I don't know. Whatever happened yesterday,

1312
01:57:24,729 --> 01:57:26,729
I just forget it. As of today, it sucks.

1313
01:57:26,729 --> 01:57:31,340
It happens all the time.

1314
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:33,899
Just bring me up to speed.

1315
01:57:33,899 --> 01:57:41,829
This is a cool bed.

1316
01:57:41,829 --> 01:57:50,520
Not that cool.

1317
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,520
No, I don't want to...

1318
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,520
Not today. Something else.

1319
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,520
Something else. Not today.

1320
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:06,899
Fuck. Whatever.

1321
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:08,899
I'm not even being able to pee before you go to work.

1322
01:58:08,899 --> 01:58:10,899
I'm coming!

1323
01:58:10,899 --> 01:58:13,340
Just wait!

1324
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:19,399
Look.

1325
01:58:19,399 --> 01:58:28,739
Pecan sandies.

1326
01:58:28,739 --> 01:58:32,310
Time to make the money.

1327
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:34,310
Wait. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

1328
01:58:34,310 --> 01:58:36,619
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

1329
01:58:36,619 --> 01:58:38,619
Why do you always pull so far down?

1330
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:40,619
You're pulling my driveway.

1331
01:58:40,619 --> 01:59:11,340
Why do I have to walk down the street to see you?

1332
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:16,390
Hi, Adam. Hi, Sweden.

1333
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:19,659
Are you with them?

1334
01:59:19,659 --> 01:59:24,710
You're falling very far behind.

1335
01:59:24,710 --> 01:59:26,710
I don't trust people that work out that much.

1336
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:28,710
Seriously.

1337
01:59:28,710 --> 01:59:30,710
What do you have to prove?

1338
01:59:30,710 --> 01:59:32,710
You can take a day off.

1339
01:59:32,710 --> 01:59:34,710
You've got Monday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Thursday.

1340
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:36,710
What do you have to prove?

1341
01:59:36,710 --> 01:59:38,710
I've been working out literally seven days a week. There's no reason to...

1342
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:41,140
Shit.

1343
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:43,140
Hey, how are you?

1344
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:45,140
Hi. It's really great to see you again.

1345
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:47,140
Yes, I'm one of those people

1346
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:49,140
that talks a lot of things about somebody

1347
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:51,140
and then when they see them, they pretend like

1348
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:53,140
they didn't say those things at all.

1349
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:55,510
How are you?

1350
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:57,510
Yes, tomorrow morning.

1351
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:59,510
16 miles.

1352
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:01,510
Yes, of course.

1353
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:03,510
Absolutely.

1354
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:06,199
If you could do that

1355
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:08,199
away from my house.

1356
02:00:08,199 --> 02:00:10,199
There's like six different intersections here

1357
02:00:10,199 --> 02:00:12,760
you could go down.

1358
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:14,760
I don't want to hear that in the morning or in the night.

1359
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:21,350
Fuck those people.

1360
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:33,050
I feel like shit.

1361
02:00:33,050 --> 02:00:36,819
Long day.

1362
02:00:36,819 --> 02:00:38,819
I'm hungry and I want

1363
02:00:38,819 --> 02:00:40,819
to shower and I'm not having a great time.

1364
02:00:40,819 --> 02:00:42,819
Those people are having a great time

1365
02:00:42,819 --> 02:00:44,819
outside.

1366
02:00:44,819 --> 02:00:47,960
Why can't I have a good time too?

1367
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,960
I've got like Ted shit here.

1368
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:53,930
Thank you.

1369
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:56,100
Some of you listen, some of you don't.

1370
02:00:56,100 --> 02:00:58,340
It's okay.

1371
02:00:58,340 --> 02:01:19,189
So much better.

1372
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:22,140
But you know what I mean though?

1373
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:24,140
It's like you work out so much that you don't have time for anything else.

1374
02:01:24,140 --> 02:01:26,699
I don't care

1375
02:01:26,699 --> 02:01:28,699
how much you've worked out.

1376
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:31,319
Look, I'm just trying to live.

1377
02:01:31,319 --> 02:01:33,319
If I sit down and we're at lunch and you say

1378
02:01:33,319 --> 02:01:35,319
like, oh hey dude, by the way

1379
02:01:35,319 --> 02:01:37,319
I could do like

1380
02:01:37,319 --> 02:01:39,319
500 pounds five times for the rep.

1381
02:01:39,319 --> 02:01:41,319
I don't care.

1382
02:01:41,319 --> 02:01:43,560
That's good for you. You're saying that because I

1383
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,560
can't do that. You're saying that to me because

1384
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:47,560
I can't do it.

1385
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:51,140
God, you know what I can do?

1386
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:53,140
You know what I can do that they can't?

1387
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:56,409
Not much.

1388
02:01:56,409 --> 02:01:58,970
Not very much at all actually.

1389
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:00,970
Actually it hurts to walk around for me at the moment.

1390
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:04,229
But you know what? One day I'll get there.

1391
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:07,180
That feels better.

1392
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:26,619
What is this?

1393
02:02:26,619 --> 02:02:30,199
But they that wait upon the Lord

1394
02:02:30,199 --> 02:02:32,199
shall renew their strength. They shall mount up

1395
02:02:32,199 --> 02:02:34,199
with wings as eagles.

1396
02:02:34,199 --> 02:02:36,199
They shall run and not be weary

1397
02:02:36,199 --> 02:02:38,199
and they shall walk and not faint.

1398
02:02:38,199 --> 02:02:42,869
You know, I've actually seen this in somebody's bathroom

1399
02:02:42,869 --> 02:02:45,560
before.

1400
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:49,659
I've seen that before.

1401
02:02:49,659 --> 02:02:51,659
Whatever. I guess it should sit here. Here it is.

1402
02:02:51,659 --> 02:02:59,829
Showered.

1403
02:02:59,829 --> 02:03:01,829
I feel clean. I feel good.

1404
02:03:01,829 --> 02:03:03,829
Although I'm kind of not having a great time

1405
02:03:03,829 --> 02:03:06,649
but you know, whatever.

1406
02:03:06,649 --> 02:03:08,649
I got my expensive watch. That's all that matters, right?

1407
02:03:08,649 --> 02:03:27,260
Let's go to the bathroom.

1408
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:38,140
Let's fucking stool out of the way.

1409
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:40,140
I don't know. I have to look at this

1410
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:42,380
every time I pee.

1411
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:44,380
By the way, that's like

1412
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:46,680
what are you blurring?

1413
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:48,680
There's somebody like sitting on that toilet

1414
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:51,180
that you're blurring.

1415
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:53,180
Who is that? That's not

1416
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:55,800
me. Oops!

1417
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:58,739
Wait, I'm done. Okay, we're good.

1418
02:03:58,739 --> 02:04:02,010
Like there's somebody else sitting on

1419
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:05,659
that toilet. No, no, no,

1420
02:04:05,659 --> 02:04:07,659
no, no. I'm going to the bedroom.

1421
02:04:07,659 --> 02:04:19,109
You gave me this like mystery box of

1422
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:22,060
stools. I'm gonna place them.

1423
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:31,319
What time is it? It's pretty

1424
02:04:31,319 --> 02:04:35,289
late. It's alright. We'll put two

1425
02:04:35,289 --> 02:04:38,550
here. We'll put one over here.

1426
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:41,050
Not like it matters.

1427
02:04:41,050 --> 02:04:45,659
I don't know. I'm getting

1428
02:04:45,659 --> 02:04:49,560
kind of annoyed.

1429
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:51,560
What do I even need these stools for?

1430
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:53,560
I'm okay. Don't get too upset.

1431
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:56,819
Hey, this is how tall I want to be.

1432
02:04:56,819 --> 02:05:00,600
All of you are the five, seven

1433
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:03,100
men out there. You ever thought

1434
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:05,100
about this? You ever think about how big you were?

1435
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:08,739
If you were this big?

1436
02:05:08,739 --> 02:05:10,979
This is what? Six, six, two?

1437
02:05:10,979 --> 02:05:12,979
Man. God, what a figure

1438
02:05:12,979 --> 02:05:15,220
that would be. Wouldn't it?

1439
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:20,659
How about, um,

1440
02:05:20,659 --> 02:05:25,340
I don't know. We can put them next to the bed.

1441
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:30,630
How about like one here?

1442
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:34,409
One here. And then

1443
02:05:34,409 --> 02:05:37,590
should all three go over there?

1444
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:39,590
I don't hate that. I really don't.

1445
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:51,619
Three stools in front

1446
02:05:51,619 --> 02:05:53,619
of the bed. I don't know if you get on the side.

1447
02:05:53,619 --> 02:05:57,020
If you're as tired as I am

1448
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:59,020
right now, that seems like a pretty good idea.

1449
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:01,260
That means I can get out of the bed. I can put my feet

1450
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:03,260
down on three different places.

1451
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:09,189
Ugh. I am

1452
02:06:09,189 --> 02:06:15,779
tired. How much

1453
02:06:15,779 --> 02:06:19,369
cash do we have? How much money?

1454
02:06:19,369 --> 02:06:22,699
What do we got for cash?

1455
02:06:22,699 --> 02:06:24,699
$19.60. Give me something

1456
02:06:24,699 --> 02:06:31,739
nice for God's sakes.

1457
02:06:31,739 --> 02:06:33,739
I got money. So, no, that makes sense

1458
02:06:33,739 --> 02:06:35,739
because then I don't have to clean all this shit up. That's a good idea.

1459
02:06:35,739 --> 02:06:40,220
Calling a maid is a good idea.

1460
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:44,869
Thank you.

1461
02:06:44,869 --> 02:06:46,869
Because the last, I don't want to clean

1462
02:06:46,869 --> 02:06:48,869
anything up. I want to be able to have somebody else do it.

1463
02:06:48,869 --> 02:06:50,869
We got almost two grand. Let's use it.

1464
02:06:50,869 --> 02:06:55,779
Hi. Yes.

1465
02:06:55,779 --> 02:06:57,779
I would love to, I'd like to have a service

1466
02:06:57,779 --> 02:07:01,430
started please. Yeah, the address

1467
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:03,430
is 9-8-5, 9-8-5, Dollhouse Way.

1468
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:06,180
I mean, you know

1469
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:08,180
you're in this fucked up cartoon universe

1470
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,180
with the rest of us. Yeah.

1471
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:13,819
Okay. Thank you.

1472
02:07:13,819 --> 02:07:16,180
Do you live in the neighborhood too?

1473
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:18,180
Are you like down the street? Because it seems like everybody lives next to each other here.

1474
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:21,319
Okay.

1475
02:07:21,319 --> 02:07:24,060
Thank you. Today?

1476
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:26,060
I mean, I'm tired, but okay, fine. That's fine.

1477
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:29,510
Alright, goodbye. Alright, let's get a maid

1478
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:31,510
in here. I don't want to have to deal with this. They'll take care of it.

1479
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:36,630
That was very, that was very quick.

1480
02:07:36,630 --> 02:07:38,630
They're here. They must, they must

1481
02:07:38,630 --> 02:07:43,939
live in the neighborhood.

1482
02:07:43,939 --> 02:07:47,270
I'm so tired though.

1483
02:07:47,270 --> 02:07:50,659
Alright, maid service.

1484
02:07:50,659 --> 02:07:52,659
Here we are.

1485
02:07:52,659 --> 02:07:56,550
Hi. Hi.

1486
02:07:56,550 --> 02:07:59,180
I'm assuming that

1487
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:01,180
you must be the maid?

1488
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:03,180
I heard you ordered a sexy maid service.

1489
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:07,659
You can stop.

1490
02:08:07,659 --> 02:08:09,659
You have a big mess to clean, don't you?

1491
02:08:09,659 --> 02:08:11,659
Stop doing the lap track. I don't want that.

1492
02:08:11,659 --> 02:08:13,659
Yes, there's a mess in here. It's very messy.

1493
02:08:13,659 --> 02:08:15,659
Well, trust me. I can take care of your big mess.

1494
02:08:15,659 --> 02:08:18,020
Okay, come on in.

1495
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:20,020
Show me where it is.

1496
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:22,020
Pretty much what I want you to do.

1497
02:08:22,020 --> 02:08:24,020
Come on in and watch the door behind you.

1498
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:26,020
You don't want to get hit by that.

1499
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:28,020
Such a gentleman.

1500
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:30,020
What a unique arrangement.

1501
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:32,020
Yeah, so there's this trash here.

1502
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:34,020
This is dusty?

1503
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:36,020
Yes, it is. It's very dusty.

1504
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:38,020
So if you want to dust, you can, there's

1505
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:40,020
some fruit here that needs to be cleaned up.

1506
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:42,020
Oh, saw stain.

1507
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:44,020
So there's, in the bathroom,

1508
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:46,020
the toilet needs to be cleaned.

1509
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:48,020
The trash needs to be taken out, this flower,

1510
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:50,020
the fridge needs to be cleaned.

1511
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:52,020
This room, the bathroom, any other rooms?

1512
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:55,289
Yes, come with me. I'll show you.

1513
02:08:55,289 --> 02:08:57,289
The bathroom definitely needs to be cleaned.

1514
02:08:57,289 --> 02:08:59,289
The sinks need to be cleaned.

1515
02:08:59,289 --> 02:09:01,289
If you have an opportunity to, it would be great.

1516
02:09:01,289 --> 02:09:03,289
How much do you charge?

1517
02:09:03,289 --> 02:09:05,289
Well, for you, I'll drop my prices to

1518
02:09:05,289 --> 02:09:07,529
$2,000.

1519
02:09:07,529 --> 02:09:09,529
That's $2,000 for this?

1520
02:09:09,529 --> 02:09:11,529
For the sexy maid service.

1521
02:09:11,529 --> 02:09:13,529
Why is this $2,000?

1522
02:09:13,529 --> 02:09:15,529
No, it's like $100. It's not $2,000.

1523
02:09:15,529 --> 02:09:17,529
Well, lead me to the bedroom and I can

1524
02:09:17,529 --> 02:09:19,529
show I'm worth $2,000.

1525
02:09:19,529 --> 02:09:21,529
No.

1526
02:09:21,529 --> 02:09:23,529
$2,000.

1527
02:09:23,529 --> 02:09:25,529
What are you trying to say?

1528
02:09:25,529 --> 02:09:27,529
Am I not sexy?

1529
02:09:27,529 --> 02:09:29,529
I didn't say any of that. I'm looking for

1530
02:09:29,529 --> 02:09:31,529
a maid service to help clean up, maybe make the bed.

1531
02:09:31,529 --> 02:09:33,529
Okay. How sexy

1532
02:09:33,529 --> 02:09:35,829
am I worth?

1533
02:09:35,829 --> 02:09:37,829
I don't have $2,000.

1534
02:09:37,829 --> 02:09:39,829
Okay, well you're the one who called a sexy

1535
02:09:39,829 --> 02:09:42,710
maid service.

1536
02:09:42,710 --> 02:09:44,710
Well, honestly,

1537
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:46,710
I think you look great. I do.

1538
02:09:46,710 --> 02:09:48,710
I think you're probably the best looking maid service

1539
02:09:48,710 --> 02:09:50,710
maid I've ever seen in my life.

1540
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:54,550
Do you mean that?

1541
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:56,789
Yes, of course. Go on.

1542
02:09:56,789 --> 02:09:58,789
I think you're the most attractive,

1543
02:09:58,789 --> 02:10:00,789
sexiest maid ever.

1544
02:10:00,789 --> 02:10:03,350
I do. I really do.

1545
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:05,350
Please keep going. You're so wonderful.

1546
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:09,350
Let me show you the bathroom.

1547
02:10:09,350 --> 02:10:11,350
Okay, come on into the bathroom.

1548
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:14,739
So, I have a plunger.

1549
02:10:14,739 --> 02:10:16,739
I have a plunger.

1550
02:10:16,739 --> 02:10:18,739
And if anything ever happens to the toilet,

1551
02:10:18,739 --> 02:10:20,739
I'm sure you'll be coming and going over the course of the

1552
02:10:20,739 --> 02:10:22,739
Do you just want me to clean your house?

1553
02:10:22,739 --> 02:10:25,050
Uh, yeah.

1554
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:28,060
Why didn't you just call a regular

1555
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:30,060
I'm a sexy maid.

1556
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:32,060
That's...

1557
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:34,060
What do you mean sexy maid?

1558
02:10:34,060 --> 02:10:36,060
Well, like a regular maid service is like a hundred,

1559
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:38,060
maybe two. But when you add the sexy,

1560
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:40,060
it's $2,000 for a maid.

1561
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:42,060
Well, what would you do for $100?

1562
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:44,060
Clean your house, I guess.

1563
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:46,060
That's perfect. That works for me.

1564
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:48,060
$200?

1565
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:50,060
Are you coming here every other day?

1566
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:52,060
Yeah, I'll come. You still think I look sexy, though, right?

1567
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:54,060
I do, I do. $200,

1568
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:56,060
is that all right with you? You want to go lower?

1569
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:58,060
That's okay with $150.

1570
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:00,060
But if you're ever interested in

1571
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:02,060
expanding

1572
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:04,060
my rules.

1573
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:06,060
Yes, I will keep that very much in mind. If you come this way

1574
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:08,060
and just take a look and start doing your thing,

1575
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:11,319
I'll clean over here.

1576
02:11:11,319 --> 02:11:13,319
Pick that before I fucking shit my pants in front of the maid.

1577
02:11:13,319 --> 02:11:16,069
Sexy maid.

1578
02:11:16,069 --> 02:11:18,380
$2,000.

1579
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:20,380
That's so much money.

1580
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:27,479
I'm just trying to get my life

1581
02:11:27,479 --> 02:11:29,720
together in here before I go back in there.

1582
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:34,840
And I'm fucking tired, too.

1583
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:44,060
It's four.

1584
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:46,060
Thank you so much.

1585
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:53,609
Wait, where is it going?

1586
02:11:53,609 --> 02:11:55,609
Wait, what?

1587
02:11:55,609 --> 02:11:57,609
Am I sick?

1588
02:11:57,609 --> 02:11:59,609
Do I have

1589
02:11:59,609 --> 02:12:01,609
the norovirus? What's happening?

1590
02:12:01,609 --> 02:12:03,609
Sir?

1591
02:12:03,609 --> 02:12:05,609
Yeah? Are you all right?

1592
02:12:05,609 --> 02:12:07,609
I'm okay in here. You don't have to come in.

1593
02:12:07,609 --> 02:12:09,609
Do you have a big mess you need cleaning?

1594
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:14,170
No, you can stay out there.

1595
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:16,859
Okay.

1596
02:12:16,859 --> 02:12:19,539
All right, that's good. What did I eat?

1597
02:12:19,539 --> 02:12:21,539
Those pecan sandies, I swear to God.

1598
02:12:21,539 --> 02:12:28,840
Do you like

1599
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:31,340
food? Yeah.

1600
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:33,340
Do you like bread? Yeah.

1601
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:35,340
I wonder if they'll help. Wait, my bread?

1602
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:37,340
Yes, this bread. I got multi-grain bread over there.

1603
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:39,340
Wow. Do you like multi-grain bread?

1604
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:41,340
I like multi-grain bread. Yeah.

1605
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:43,579
Could I ask you why?

1606
02:12:43,579 --> 02:12:45,939
Aesthetically,

1607
02:12:45,939 --> 02:12:47,939
I thought it made sense to put it in the corner here

1608
02:12:47,939 --> 02:12:49,939
to make sure there's enough room for people to come around.

1609
02:12:49,939 --> 02:12:51,939
There's not enough space. Maybe eventually

1610
02:12:51,939 --> 02:12:53,939
there'll be a TV up here, like a big screen TV

1611
02:12:53,939 --> 02:12:55,939
up here. Okay. Yeah, like they could watch

1612
02:12:55,939 --> 02:12:57,939
the TV, play video games.

1613
02:12:57,939 --> 02:12:59,939
It would have made sense so they could flush.

1614
02:12:59,939 --> 02:13:01,939
Well, you're a maid. You're not an interior designer.

1615
02:13:01,939 --> 02:13:03,939
You're right. I'm just a maid.

1616
02:13:03,939 --> 02:13:11,300
That was the bread.

1617
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:14,060
That was the bread we have to eat.

1618
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:21,220
I'll clean the bathroom next.

1619
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:37,529
I can still eat it.

1620
02:13:37,529 --> 02:13:39,529
Uh, excuse me, uh,

1621
02:13:39,529 --> 02:13:41,529
sexy maid. What?

1622
02:13:41,529 --> 02:13:43,529
Would you like a piece of bread?

1623
02:13:43,529 --> 02:13:46,409
Sure.

1624
02:13:46,409 --> 02:13:50,890
Okay.

1625
02:13:50,890 --> 02:13:52,890
Let's get some bread on the fucking stovetop.

1626
02:13:52,890 --> 02:13:59,720
Would you like a piece of bread?

1627
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:01,720
I've got bread, and they throw it on the ground, but it's okay.

1628
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:04,729
Why don't you grab a piece of bread? I want you to eat.

1629
02:14:04,729 --> 02:14:07,609
Well, I've been cleaning. I wouldn't

1630
02:14:07,609 --> 02:14:09,609
dare touch it with my hands.

1631
02:14:09,609 --> 02:14:11,609
Right, but just eat.

1632
02:14:11,609 --> 02:14:15,449
Wash your hands and then eat.

1633
02:14:15,449 --> 02:14:17,449
I'm not putting it in your mouth. Right, no, of course.

1634
02:14:17,449 --> 02:14:20,970
Sorry, I'm just used to different

1635
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:26,020
clients is all.

1636
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:28,520
Out of here. I'm getting out of here.

1637
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:31,399
I'm getting out of here.

1638
02:14:31,399 --> 02:14:36,710
I'm going to the bathroom.

1639
02:14:36,710 --> 02:14:38,949
I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to stay here.

1640
02:14:38,949 --> 02:14:40,949
And, excuse me,

1641
02:14:40,949 --> 02:14:44,090
this job

1642
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:46,090
is not done.

1643
02:14:46,090 --> 02:14:49,670
The maid is scaring me.

1644
02:14:49,670 --> 02:14:54,149
Our job's not done.

1645
02:14:54,149 --> 02:15:00,020
I'm so tired.

1646
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:02,020
God, I think I'm going to pass out.

1647
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:04,260
I think I really am going to pass out.

1648
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:07,909
I need to go to bed. I have to go to bed so bad.

1649
02:15:07,909 --> 02:15:13,100
I'm sorry if I smell

1650
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,100
a little weird. It's just, it's been a long day.

1651
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:19,770
Well, that's two hundred dollars.

1652
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:22,579
Are you going to, what?

1653
02:15:22,579 --> 02:15:25,909
Two hundred? I thought it was one

1654
02:15:25,909 --> 02:15:28,600
fifty. I cleaned more than

1655
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:30,600
I thought I had to. There was a big mess in the bathroom.

1656
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:33,670
Okay, take two

1657
02:15:33,670 --> 02:15:36,039
hundred. Alright, sir, well,

1658
02:15:36,039 --> 02:15:38,039
I'll see you in a few days. Yeah,

1659
02:15:38,039 --> 02:15:40,039
and it's one hundred fifty each time, right?

1660
02:15:40,039 --> 02:15:42,039
From here on out, we'll talk about it.

1661
02:15:42,039 --> 02:15:44,039
And we're not doing anything else.

1662
02:15:44,039 --> 02:15:46,039
You still want me to wear this next time I come?

1663
02:15:46,039 --> 02:15:48,039
If you like, if you're

1664
02:15:48,039 --> 02:15:50,039
comfortable wearing that, you can.

1665
02:15:50,039 --> 02:15:59,640
You dog. It's been a weird

1666
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:02,460
day. I'm tired.

1667
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:04,630
Give me something to play with. Give me something to hang out

1668
02:16:04,630 --> 02:16:06,630
with. I mean, you guys, seriously, like, I,

1669
02:16:06,630 --> 02:16:08,630
I gotta go to bed. I can't

1670
02:16:08,630 --> 02:16:10,630
just sleep on a couch every fucking day.

1671
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:12,630
Give me, like, give me, like, give me the bedroom.

1672
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:21,079
Get me to get me to bed. What

1673
02:16:21,079 --> 02:16:28,569
is it? What does it say?

1674
02:16:28,569 --> 02:16:35,350
You didn't want it? What?

1675
02:16:35,350 --> 02:16:44,889
Why not? Scammed.

1676
02:16:44,889 --> 02:16:49,500
I, literally, I can,

1677
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:51,500
all I can see is colors. It's

1678
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:53,500
the only thing I can see. I just see pink and I see

1679
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:55,500
like green. I see pink here.

1680
02:16:55,500 --> 02:17:00,489
It's just pink.

1681
02:17:00,489 --> 02:17:02,489
I need somebody who has to tell me to

1682
02:17:02,489 --> 02:17:04,489
go to bed. If I don't, then

1683
02:17:04,489 --> 02:17:06,489
you're just gonna get me fucked up again.

1684
02:17:06,489 --> 02:17:08,489
All I see is pink colors. Is it?

1685
02:17:08,489 --> 02:17:11,559
That was really cool made. I really

1686
02:17:11,559 --> 02:17:13,559
thought they were cool. I like to work out people too.

1687
02:17:13,559 --> 02:17:15,739
I'm gonna get into the bedroom as fast

1688
02:17:15,739 --> 02:17:17,739
as I can because I don't want to have a problem.

1689
02:17:17,739 --> 02:17:20,489
For the first time fucking ever.

1690
02:17:20,489 --> 02:17:22,489
For the first time ever you made me

1691
02:17:22,489 --> 02:17:24,489
go to sleep. Thank you. Seriously,

1692
02:17:24,489 --> 02:17:26,489
like, this is the first time you've ever done it.

1693
02:17:26,489 --> 02:17:28,489
Took you long enough.

1694
02:26:42,459 --> 02:26:52,680
Um, what is that?

1695
02:26:52,680 --> 02:27:03,620
What is that? Why is there a computer

1696
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:05,620
in my, in front of my fucking door?

1697
02:27:05,620 --> 02:27:09,719
There's a computer here?

1698
02:27:09,719 --> 02:27:11,719
What is outside? I hear something.

1699
02:27:11,719 --> 02:27:17,100
Dog or something?

1700
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:21,510
Oh no.

1701
02:27:21,510 --> 02:27:27,459
My god.

1702
02:27:27,459 --> 02:27:30,219
Oh my fucking

1703
02:27:30,219 --> 02:27:33,100
god.

1704
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:35,100
I don't know what to do. What am I doing

1705
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:37,100
in this scenario? Is it because of the food?

1706
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:39,100
Oh it's trash!

1707
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:44,579
Um, what time

1708
02:27:44,579 --> 02:27:46,579
is it? It's fucking like

1709
02:27:46,579 --> 02:27:48,819
one o'clock in the morning.

1710
02:27:48,819 --> 02:27:52,540
Oh shit.

1711
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:58,040
Are you gonna see me? I hope

1712
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:01,750
you can't see me. What the

1713
02:28:01,750 --> 02:28:03,750
what am I supposed to do about this? I gotta go in the other

1714
02:28:03,750 --> 02:28:07,139
I gotta go in the bedroom.

1715
02:28:07,139 --> 02:28:09,139
Oh my god.

1716
02:28:09,139 --> 02:28:11,510
But yay, computer.

1717
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:18,680
Cool.

1718
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:21,239
Huh? You want me to do

1719
02:28:21,239 --> 02:28:24,819
what? I don't know.

1720
02:28:24,819 --> 02:28:26,819
I'm not going out there. What the fuck am I

1721
02:28:26,819 --> 02:28:31,110
doing?

1722
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:34,120
Uh, alright.

1723
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:36,120
It's time for you to pay. I don't want to go

1724
02:28:36,120 --> 02:28:39,059
out here.

1725
02:28:39,059 --> 02:28:41,059
Why would you make me do this?

1726
02:28:41,059 --> 02:28:43,059
Hey bear, you're in deep shit.

1727
02:28:43,059 --> 02:28:45,370
Oh

1728
02:28:45,370 --> 02:28:47,610
oh

1729
02:28:47,610 --> 02:28:49,610
Oh my god, he's biting

1730
02:28:49,610 --> 02:28:51,610
me. Oh my body.

1731
02:28:51,610 --> 02:28:53,610
Jesus.

1732
02:28:53,610 --> 02:28:55,610
Play dead, play dead, play dead.

1733
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:58,040
Play dead, play dead.

1734
02:29:05,739 --> 02:30:01,780
What are you doing?

1735
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:07,799
Do you see what he did out here? Why

1736
02:30:07,799 --> 02:30:11,379
don't you make me go confront him?

1737
02:30:11,379 --> 02:30:13,379
Are you out of your mind? Are you out of

1738
02:30:13,379 --> 02:30:16,709
your mind? What am I

1739
02:30:16,709 --> 02:30:18,709
gonna do versus a bear

1740
02:30:18,709 --> 02:30:20,709
that's five times as big as me?

1741
02:30:20,709 --> 02:30:24,229
Oh

1742
02:30:24,229 --> 02:30:28,139
I didn't even sleep

1743
02:30:28,139 --> 02:30:31,780
all the way through the night. Oh

1744
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:36,969
this is messy. Good thing

1745
02:30:36,969 --> 02:30:38,969
I have a maid. At least they'll be able to help me clean

1746
02:30:38,969 --> 02:30:40,969
this shit up.

1747
02:30:40,969 --> 02:30:42,969
Close the door for the love of god.

1748
02:30:42,969 --> 02:30:44,969
I don't want to fucking, why are there

1749
02:30:44,969 --> 02:30:48,229
bears here?

1750
02:30:48,229 --> 02:30:51,690
Oh god.

1751
02:31:07,819 --> 02:31:10,569
I'm here. Wait.

1752
02:31:31,879 --> 02:32:00,809
Go fuck yourself. Good thing I got my

1753
02:32:00,809 --> 02:32:07,139
watch. I feel so bad.

1754
02:32:09,959 --> 02:32:11,959
Oh there's a mess in my yard.

1755
02:32:11,959 --> 02:32:13,959
There's a mess in my yard.

1756
02:32:13,959 --> 02:32:15,959
There's a mess.

1757
02:32:15,959 --> 02:32:18,840
There's a mess in my yard.

1758
02:32:21,209 --> 02:32:25,159
Wait.

1759
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:42,950
I've covered his face. I've covered his bruises.

1760
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:44,950
I need to go to the

1761
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:46,950
sleep a lot for a while and then I need to go

1762
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:48,950
and get something to eat and then I need to

1763
02:32:48,950 --> 02:32:57,139
have something to do.

1764
02:32:57,139 --> 02:33:01,559
Holy shit. I can't

1765
02:33:01,559 --> 02:33:04,180
stream right now. There's no way

1766
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:06,180
I can stream. What do you want me to stream?

1767
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:10,180
Oh no!

1768
02:33:10,180 --> 02:33:12,180
No! I refuse.

1769
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:14,180
I can't.

1770
02:33:14,180 --> 02:33:16,180
I can't.

1771
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:18,940
I can't.

1772
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:21,819
I can't.

1773
02:33:37,139 --> 02:33:39,139
Hey what's going on everybody? It's Jerma here.

1774
02:33:39,139 --> 02:33:41,139
We're going to be playing some Call of Duty.

1775
02:33:41,139 --> 02:33:43,139
So as you can see here

1776
02:33:43,139 --> 02:33:45,139
I'm going to be in the menu for a little while.

1777
02:33:45,139 --> 02:33:47,139
And welcome to the stream. It's good to have you here.

1778
02:33:47,139 --> 02:33:49,139
Of course I have a pretty good day today.

1779
02:33:49,139 --> 02:33:51,139
I had a crazy

1780
02:33:51,139 --> 02:33:53,139
scenario happen. A crazy scenario.

1781
02:33:53,139 --> 02:33:55,139
Yeah. Hold on let me get in here.

1782
02:33:55,139 --> 02:33:57,450
What's that?

1783
02:33:57,450 --> 02:33:59,450
Oh no way dude. Yeah that's so funny.

1784
02:33:59,450 --> 02:34:01,450
But dude I saw a bear outside today.

1785
02:34:01,450 --> 02:34:03,450
Yeah it was in the trash

1786
02:34:03,450 --> 02:34:05,450
and I walked out there and I was like what the heck

1787
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:07,450
is that bear? And eventually

1788
02:34:07,450 --> 02:34:09,450
I went outside and I did like a little

1789
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:11,450
horn and the bear like

1790
02:34:11,450 --> 02:34:13,450
got away from the horn.

1791
02:34:13,450 --> 02:34:18,120
Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.

1792
02:34:18,120 --> 02:41:27,690
Beep. Beep. Beep.

1793
02:41:27,690 --> 02:41:33,190
Shit when I sleep. What does it say?

1794
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:36,059
The fucking

1795
02:41:36,059 --> 02:41:38,549
water does that.

1796
02:41:38,549 --> 02:41:41,500
You have been banned

1797
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:43,500
from Twitch for 24 hours as temporary

1798
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:45,500
ban for sleeping on stream.

1799
02:41:45,500 --> 02:41:48,250
Oh what the fuck?

1800
02:41:48,250 --> 02:41:53,299
What?

1801
02:41:53,299 --> 02:41:55,299
When did I go to sleep? I didn't go to sleep on stream.

1802
02:41:55,299 --> 02:42:01,000
What are you talking about?

1803
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:07,590
Give me a fucking break.

1804
02:42:07,590 --> 02:42:09,590
A ban? That's the first ban I've ever had.

1805
02:42:09,590 --> 02:42:12,149
Are you sure I didn't get banned because I'm streaming

1806
02:42:12,149 --> 02:42:16,819
from my toilet? Sleeping

1807
02:42:16,819 --> 02:42:18,819
on stream I think is way less offensive

1808
02:42:18,819 --> 02:42:20,819
than like shitting on the toilet

1809
02:42:20,819 --> 02:42:24,020
and streaming. Just

1810
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:27,219
like that. That's six by the way.

1811
02:42:27,219 --> 02:42:38,229
I'd like to take a shower right now please.

1812
02:42:38,229 --> 02:42:52,229
Ugh. It's the first ban

1813
02:42:52,229 --> 02:42:57,479
I've ever had. I hope I didn't like see

1814
02:42:57,479 --> 02:43:01,190
anything weird in my sleep. Fucking

1815
02:43:01,190 --> 02:43:03,190
starving and stuff. Oh yi yi.

1816
02:43:03,190 --> 02:43:08,250
Ugh. Ban

1817
02:43:08,250 --> 02:43:11,899
from Twitch.

1818
02:43:11,899 --> 02:43:14,459
Can I call anybody?

1819
02:43:14,459 --> 02:43:19,510
I don't know. I say all kinds of weird

1820
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:21,510
fucked up shit. Let me just brush my teeth real quick.

1821
02:43:21,510 --> 02:43:24,010
There we go.

1822
02:43:24,010 --> 02:43:27,590
Brush your teeth in the shower.

1823
02:43:27,590 --> 02:43:29,590
It saves about five minutes. That's a pro

1824
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:31,829
tip for everybody. Coming up.

1825
02:43:31,829 --> 02:43:42,120
So what happened?

1826
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:44,120
Why is there like

1827
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:46,120
an office chair next

1828
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:48,809
to the toilet?

1829
02:43:48,809 --> 02:43:51,110
Why would there be an

1830
02:43:51,110 --> 02:43:53,110
office chair here? In case somebody

1831
02:43:53,110 --> 02:43:55,610
wanted to watch?

1832
02:43:55,610 --> 02:43:57,610
Oh hey man you got an extra seat? Yeah.

1833
02:43:57,610 --> 02:43:59,610
You sit in the toilet I'll watch you.

1834
02:43:59,610 --> 02:44:01,610
Why is there an office chair?

1835
02:44:01,610 --> 02:44:04,170
I'm starving.

1836
02:44:04,170 --> 02:44:11,399
It's a piece of bread on the ground.

1837
02:44:11,399 --> 02:44:18,809
Good.

1838
02:44:22,139 --> 02:44:24,139
I'm not going to work today by the way

1839
02:44:24,139 --> 02:44:26,139
just in case you were curious.

1840
02:44:26,139 --> 02:44:28,139
Not going to work.

1841
02:44:28,139 --> 02:44:30,549
You can leave without me.

1842
02:44:30,549 --> 02:44:33,110
I got plenty of money. Go on.

1843
02:44:33,110 --> 02:44:35,110
Not going to work. Go on.

1844
02:44:35,110 --> 02:44:38,059
Without me. And tell the boss I said

1845
02:44:38,059 --> 02:44:40,059
I'm the biggest producer so I can

1846
02:44:40,059 --> 02:44:42,870
stay home.

1847
02:44:44,870 --> 02:44:49,590
What is this?

1848
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:57,850
Does this work?

1849
02:44:57,850 --> 02:45:00,729
Is this an organ?

1850
02:45:00,729 --> 02:45:25,500
I don't think it works.

1851
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:27,500
How about we play Radical Dreamers from

1852
02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:30,950
Chrono Cross?

1853
02:45:30,950 --> 02:46:06,139
Pretty good!

1854
02:46:06,139 --> 02:46:08,569
And how about Super Mario?

1855
02:46:08,569 --> 02:46:17,340
Sounds fucking

1856
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:19,340
terrible.

1857
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:21,579
Can I do like reverb?

1858
02:46:21,579 --> 02:46:32,780
What?

1859
02:46:36,979 --> 02:46:46,780
There we go.

1860
02:46:46,780 --> 02:46:48,780
Now we can now get it.

1861
02:47:01,399 --> 02:47:03,399
What do they want me to do?

1862
02:47:03,399 --> 02:47:15,819
Food.

1863
02:47:15,819 --> 02:47:18,569
How about a piece of

1864
02:47:18,569 --> 02:47:23,110
bread?

1865
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:25,110
Because it's the easiest thing to make.

1866
02:47:25,110 --> 02:47:38,149
I like to toast it.

1867
02:47:38,149 --> 02:47:45,620
I like to toast it real quick.

1868
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:48,819
Better. I do have to pee though.

1869
02:47:48,819 --> 02:47:51,899
Or, you know, the other one.

1870
02:47:51,899 --> 02:47:57,379
I'm sad that the

1871
02:47:57,379 --> 02:47:59,379
maid threw this on the ground though.

1872
02:47:59,379 --> 02:48:04,120
I'm going to play the organ again.

1873
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:11,799
It works.

1874
02:48:11,799 --> 02:48:24,020
What do the pedals do?

1875
02:48:24,020 --> 02:48:26,020
Holy shit.

1876
02:49:01,319 --> 02:49:06,090
Hey, what? Ludwig?

1877
02:49:06,090 --> 02:49:08,090
Yeah.

1878
02:49:08,090 --> 02:49:10,459
What are you doing here?

1879
02:49:10,459 --> 02:49:13,209
You live here?

1880
02:49:13,209 --> 02:49:15,209
What are you talking about? You live here.

1881
02:49:15,209 --> 02:49:17,209
I'm sorry.

1882
02:49:17,209 --> 02:49:19,209
I've lived here for like seven years.

1883
02:49:19,209 --> 02:49:21,209
Hold on.

1884
02:49:21,209 --> 02:49:23,209
983, 983.

1885
02:49:23,209 --> 02:49:25,209
You're 983?

1886
02:49:25,209 --> 02:49:27,510
I'm 983.

1887
02:49:27,510 --> 02:49:29,510
I do not know.

1888
02:49:29,510 --> 02:49:31,510
I don't know. Just hold on.

1889
02:49:31,510 --> 02:49:33,510
Don't mind any of this shit.

1890
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:35,510
It's fine.

1891
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:37,510
Why do you have

1892
02:49:37,510 --> 02:49:39,510
trash everywhere?

1893
02:49:39,510 --> 02:49:41,510
No, don't worry about that.

1894
02:49:41,510 --> 02:49:43,510
There was a tornado that came in.

1895
02:49:43,510 --> 02:49:45,510
Did you see the tornado that came in?

1896
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:47,510
No, but yeah, they come sometimes.

1897
02:49:47,510 --> 02:49:49,510
A tornado flew through here.

1898
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:54,840
The tornado flew in

1899
02:49:54,840 --> 02:49:56,840
and it swarmed everybody.

1900
02:49:56,840 --> 02:49:58,840
You didn't get that?

1901
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:01,340
I didn't.

1902
02:50:01,340 --> 02:50:03,340
The gloves are also a little confusing to me.

1903
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:05,340
Is that normal?

1904
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:07,510
Yeah, it's very normal.

1905
02:50:07,510 --> 02:50:09,510
Tornado came in, ruined everything.

1906
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:11,510
It's nice to see you.

1907
02:50:11,510 --> 02:50:13,510
It's nice to see you too. Do you want to come in?

1908
02:50:13,510 --> 02:50:15,510
Sure.

1909
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:17,510
I was just playing this

1910
02:50:17,510 --> 02:50:19,510
because it was a gift from a friend of mine.

1911
02:50:22,139 --> 02:50:24,139
I'll get it for you.

1912
02:50:24,139 --> 02:50:26,139
We should clean.

1913
02:50:26,139 --> 02:50:29,139
I want to clean first.

1914
02:50:29,139 --> 02:50:31,139
You want me to clean with you?

1915
02:50:31,139 --> 02:50:33,139
I'm sorry. Can you just help me for a second?

1916
02:50:33,139 --> 02:50:35,139
Sure. You know we've never met before.

1917
02:50:35,139 --> 02:50:37,139
When did you move in here?

1918
02:50:37,139 --> 02:50:39,139
I've lived here for...

1919
02:50:39,139 --> 02:50:41,139
Excuse me.

1920
02:50:41,139 --> 02:50:43,139
Sheriff Tony Andrews. How you guys doing?

1921
02:50:43,139 --> 02:50:45,139
Sheriff, how's it going?

1922
02:50:45,139 --> 02:50:47,139
Listen, we're looking for a bear.

1923
02:50:47,139 --> 02:50:49,139
Have you seen the bear around here?

1924
02:50:49,139 --> 02:50:51,139
We're going around the whole neighborhood.

1925
02:50:51,139 --> 02:50:53,139
I've got animal control with me.

1926
02:50:53,139 --> 02:50:55,139
How you doing?

1927
02:50:55,139 --> 02:50:57,139
He's an expert at this stuff.

1928
02:50:57,139 --> 02:50:59,139
There was a tornado and a bear came in.

1929
02:50:59,139 --> 02:51:01,139
There was a bear and a tornado?

1930
02:51:01,139 --> 02:51:03,139
I kicked the shit out of the bear.

1931
02:51:03,139 --> 02:51:05,139
There was a tornado.

1932
02:51:05,139 --> 02:51:07,139
I can smell them.

1933
02:51:08,139 --> 02:51:10,139
I was going to say I didn't see a tornado either.

1934
02:51:10,139 --> 02:51:12,139
I'm pretty sure there's no tornadoes around here.

1935
02:51:14,139 --> 02:51:16,139
You guys like organs?

1936
02:51:16,139 --> 02:51:18,139
No. Have you seen a bear or not?

1937
02:51:18,139 --> 02:51:20,139
I had a bear I encountered yesterday.

1938
02:51:22,139 --> 02:51:24,139
You're a full day late.

1939
02:51:24,139 --> 02:51:26,139
He's waiting to go.

1940
02:51:26,139 --> 02:51:28,139
I don't know. He's a bear.

1941
02:51:28,139 --> 02:51:30,139
He's a fucking bear.

1942
02:51:30,139 --> 02:51:32,139
You got a scent?

1943
02:51:32,139 --> 02:51:34,139
I can smell him.

1944
02:51:34,139 --> 02:51:36,139
I think he went this way.

1945
02:51:36,139 --> 02:51:38,139
Nothing tricks this.

1946
02:51:38,139 --> 02:51:40,139
Why is everybody coming to my house?

1947
02:51:40,139 --> 02:51:42,139
We'll find him.

1948
02:51:42,139 --> 02:51:44,139
Listen, Sheriff Tony Andrews,

1949
02:51:44,139 --> 02:51:46,139
if you need anything, give me a call.

1950
02:51:46,139 --> 02:51:48,139
Pick up the trash.

1951
02:51:48,139 --> 02:51:50,139
Let's keep the neighborhood nice.

1952
02:51:50,139 --> 02:51:52,139
He beat a bear in a fight, right?

1953
02:51:52,139 --> 02:51:54,139
Yes, I fought a bear in a fight.

1954
02:51:54,139 --> 02:51:56,139
There was a tornado and I got an organ.

1955
02:51:56,139 --> 02:51:58,139
I knew I liked you.

1956
02:51:58,139 --> 02:52:00,139
I really like you, but I didn't know you lived here.

1957
02:52:00,139 --> 02:52:02,139
I just live here. I was just walking by.

1958
02:52:02,139 --> 02:52:04,139
I don't mean to intrude or anything.

1959
02:52:04,139 --> 02:52:06,139
You were playing Battleship the other day.

1960
02:52:06,139 --> 02:52:08,139
You still owe me a lot from that.

1961
02:52:08,139 --> 02:52:10,139
I do. I have quite a few things.

1962
02:52:10,139 --> 02:52:12,139
I get to get in a shirt.

1963
02:52:12,139 --> 02:52:14,139
I get to do a thing in a shirt.

1964
02:52:14,139 --> 02:52:16,139
Milky Maids, 1500.

1965
02:52:16,139 --> 02:52:18,139
If you ever wanted to play again,

1966
02:52:18,139 --> 02:52:20,139
we could just sweep the debt.

1967
02:52:20,139 --> 02:52:24,239
Double or nothing.

1968
02:52:24,239 --> 02:52:26,239
Do you have another job here, by the way?

1969
02:52:26,239 --> 02:52:28,239
Do you work here in the town?

1970
02:52:28,239 --> 02:52:30,239
I'm a streamer.

1971
02:52:30,239 --> 02:52:32,239
Do you work here as anything else?

1972
02:52:32,239 --> 02:52:34,239
In this town?

1973
02:52:34,239 --> 02:52:36,239
Do you have houses or anything?

1974
02:52:36,239 --> 02:52:38,239
No.

1975
02:52:38,239 --> 02:52:40,239
Do you think my stream is not successful enough?

1976
02:52:40,239 --> 02:52:42,239
No.

1977
02:52:42,239 --> 02:52:44,239
I stream like a month in a row.

1978
02:52:44,239 --> 02:52:46,239
It was a long time.

1979
02:52:46,239 --> 02:52:48,239
I know.

1980
02:52:48,239 --> 02:52:50,239
It was crazy.

1981
02:52:50,239 --> 02:52:52,239
You don't do anything else in this town.

1982
02:52:52,239 --> 02:52:54,239
Again, I just stream.

1983
02:52:54,239 --> 02:52:56,239
Whatever. I won't even push it anymore.

1984
02:52:58,239 --> 02:53:00,239
You're talking about we could play what?

1985
02:53:00,239 --> 02:53:02,239
We could play Battleship?

1986
02:53:02,239 --> 02:53:05,379
Why do you have bread on the floor?

1987
02:53:05,379 --> 02:53:07,379
I'm supposed to have it made.

1988
02:53:07,379 --> 02:53:09,379
You just ate it out of the ground.

1989
02:53:09,379 --> 02:53:14,299
Should I follow you?

1990
02:53:14,299 --> 02:53:16,299
Come on in the other room.

1991
02:53:18,299 --> 02:53:20,299
Wow. This is your stream setup.

1992
02:53:20,299 --> 02:53:22,299
This is my setup, man. Check it out.

1993
02:53:22,299 --> 02:53:24,299
It's convenient to have two chairs for co-op.

1994
02:53:24,299 --> 02:53:26,299
I could look up.

1995
02:53:26,299 --> 02:53:28,299
You could watch me stream if you wanted to.

1996
02:53:28,299 --> 02:53:30,299
This is a good setup.

1997
02:53:30,299 --> 02:53:32,299
By the way, it's cleaned very well

1998
02:53:32,299 --> 02:53:34,299
from whoever that person happens to be

1999
02:53:34,299 --> 02:53:36,299
who cleans the house every so often.

2000
02:53:36,299 --> 02:53:38,299
Maid?

2001
02:53:38,299 --> 02:53:40,299
Is it a guy or a girl?

2002
02:53:40,299 --> 02:53:42,299
It's you.

2003
02:53:42,299 --> 02:53:44,299
It would be you.

2004
02:53:44,299 --> 02:53:46,299
I think it's you.

2005
02:53:46,299 --> 02:53:48,299
Do you want to co-op stream?

2006
02:53:48,299 --> 02:53:50,299
Sure, of course.

2007
02:53:50,299 --> 02:53:52,299
Do you want me to do your intro?

2008
02:53:52,299 --> 02:53:54,299
Sometimes I get nervous before a stream.

2009
02:53:57,250 --> 02:53:59,250
Let's start the stream.

2010
02:53:59,250 --> 02:54:01,739
What's up, suckers?

2011
02:54:01,739 --> 02:54:03,739
It's not live yet.

2012
02:54:03,739 --> 02:54:05,739
I'm nervous to do co-ops in person.

2013
02:54:05,739 --> 02:54:07,739
It won't go through.

2014
02:54:07,739 --> 02:54:09,739
I'm banned from Twitch.

2015
02:54:09,739 --> 02:54:11,739
Why did you get banned?

2016
02:54:14,049 --> 02:54:16,049
Do you see where I stream from?

2017
02:54:18,049 --> 02:54:20,049
This reminds me of another doctor streamer.

2018
02:54:22,049 --> 02:54:24,049
You can make it work.

2019
02:54:24,049 --> 02:54:26,049
I'm going to fall out of the thing.

2020
02:54:30,540 --> 02:54:32,540
This has been eye-opening, man.

2021
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:34,540
I didn't know that you lived here.

2022
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:36,540
I didn't know that you lived like this.

2023
02:54:36,540 --> 02:54:38,540
You've got to have your setup in a good place.

2024
02:54:40,540 --> 02:54:42,540
That's what I agree with.

2025
02:54:42,540 --> 02:54:44,540
I think we disagree on how you accomplish that.

2026
02:54:46,540 --> 02:54:48,540
I've got to shower, too.

2027
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:50,540
I feel like that shouldn't be a thing you bring up.

2028
02:54:52,540 --> 02:54:55,360
It's assumed.

2029
02:54:55,360 --> 02:54:57,360
In case you need it to, it's there.

2030
02:54:57,360 --> 02:54:59,360
Homemade cookies.

2031
02:54:59,360 --> 02:55:01,360
There are cookies.

2032
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:03,729
What do you got here?

2033
02:55:03,729 --> 02:55:07,629
You want to play?

2034
02:55:07,629 --> 02:55:09,629
No.

2035
02:55:09,629 --> 02:55:11,629
I've been waiting for your arrival for months.

2036
02:55:11,629 --> 02:55:13,629
I didn't even know you lived here.

2037
02:55:13,629 --> 02:55:15,629
I have Mickey...

2038
02:55:15,629 --> 02:55:17,629
Let's just say mouse.

2039
02:55:17,629 --> 02:55:19,629
Weird mouse cartoon gloves on.

2040
02:55:19,629 --> 02:55:21,629
Can you go ahead and open that for me?

2041
02:55:21,629 --> 02:55:23,629
I'll open it for you.

2042
02:55:23,629 --> 02:55:25,629
Let's get this moved out of the way.

2043
02:55:25,629 --> 02:55:27,629
Sorry, I've got to piss really bad.

2044
02:55:27,629 --> 02:55:29,629
You take your time. I'll set it up.

2045
02:55:29,629 --> 02:55:31,629
I don't have to go quite yet.

2046
02:55:31,629 --> 02:55:33,629
Bring it up to me.

2047
02:55:33,629 --> 02:55:35,629
Just in case you don't know in the future that I'm going to have to go eventually.

2048
02:55:35,629 --> 02:55:37,629
Thank you for the information.

2049
02:55:37,629 --> 02:55:39,629
I also will have to pee in the future.

2050
02:55:39,629 --> 02:55:41,629
There's a bathroom there, too.

2051
02:55:41,629 --> 02:55:43,629
I don't know when.

2052
02:55:43,629 --> 02:55:45,629
Should I set up your board for you?

2053
02:55:45,629 --> 02:55:47,629
I think you should because I can't touch it.

2054
02:55:47,629 --> 02:55:49,629
I made cookies with this woman.

2055
02:55:49,629 --> 02:55:51,629
Do you know Edna?

2056
02:55:51,629 --> 02:55:53,629
She lives down the street.

2057
02:55:53,629 --> 02:55:55,629
Isn't she great?

2058
02:55:55,629 --> 02:55:57,629
She's a cool chef, but she's a little weird, though.

2059
02:55:57,629 --> 02:55:59,629
Weird in a good way.

2060
02:55:59,629 --> 02:56:01,629
I got it for you.

2061
02:56:01,629 --> 02:56:03,629
I can't even touch that.

2062
02:56:03,629 --> 02:56:05,629
I think this is how it goes.

2063
02:56:07,629 --> 02:56:09,629
This looks much more complicated than I thought it was going to be.

2064
02:56:09,629 --> 02:56:11,629
You know what? I was thinking,

2065
02:56:11,629 --> 02:56:13,629
since you owe me about $500,

2066
02:56:13,629 --> 02:56:15,629
we could just do a simple...

2067
02:56:15,629 --> 02:56:17,629
You want to do two ships?

2068
02:56:17,629 --> 02:56:19,629
Two ships. Maybe even just one.

2069
02:56:19,629 --> 02:56:21,629
One ship.

2070
02:56:21,629 --> 02:56:23,629
Just a two-piece ship.

2071
02:56:23,629 --> 02:56:25,629
I can't get this other glove off because it's taped to my wrist.

2072
02:56:25,629 --> 02:56:27,629
You know what?

2073
02:56:27,629 --> 02:56:29,629
It's a great watch, though.

2074
02:56:29,629 --> 02:56:31,629
It is a really nice watch.

2075
02:56:31,629 --> 02:56:33,629
Am I flexing enough?

2076
02:56:33,629 --> 02:56:35,629
Do you know that I make pretty good money?

2077
02:56:35,629 --> 02:56:37,629
Do you know that I make good money?

2078
02:56:37,629 --> 02:56:39,629
I saw your last stream.

2079
02:56:39,629 --> 02:56:41,629
You missed a day.

2080
02:56:41,629 --> 02:56:43,629
Consistency is key.

2081
02:56:43,629 --> 02:56:45,629
You make great money.

2082
02:56:45,629 --> 02:56:47,629
I don't want you to see my screen.

2083
02:56:47,629 --> 02:56:49,629
Charming place.

2084
02:56:49,629 --> 02:56:51,629
I'm not cheating.

2085
02:56:51,629 --> 02:56:53,629
Just place one ship.

2086
02:56:53,629 --> 02:56:55,629
You're not looking, right?

2087
02:56:55,629 --> 02:56:59,090
I got my ship placed.

2088
02:56:59,090 --> 02:57:01,090
Do you have your ship placed?

2089
02:57:01,090 --> 02:57:03,090
I do.

2090
02:57:03,090 --> 02:57:05,090
Are you starting this off?

2091
02:57:05,090 --> 02:57:07,090
I'm going to say C5.

2092
02:57:07,090 --> 02:57:09,090
Just be so incorrect.

2093
02:57:09,090 --> 02:57:11,090
So incorrect.

2094
02:57:11,090 --> 02:57:13,780
It's a miss.

2095
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:15,780
This is $500 on the line.

2096
02:57:15,780 --> 02:57:17,780
What are we doing with some money?

2097
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:19,780
You owe me money. This is a double or nothing.

2098
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:22,079
Are you okay with that?

2099
02:57:22,079 --> 02:57:24,079
You can make a lot.

2100
02:57:24,079 --> 02:57:26,079
I didn't even know you lived here.

2101
02:57:26,079 --> 02:57:28,079
C5 is a miss.

2102
02:57:28,079 --> 02:57:30,079
I will go with C5 as well.

2103
02:57:30,079 --> 02:57:33,979
You're doing C5?

2104
02:57:33,979 --> 02:57:35,979
I don't like the aesthetic here.

2105
02:57:35,979 --> 02:57:37,979
Can you scoot to your left by 3 or 4 inches?

2106
02:57:37,979 --> 02:57:39,979
There we go.

2107
02:57:39,979 --> 02:57:41,979
I like the aesthetic there a little more.

2108
02:57:41,979 --> 02:57:43,979
Is that a bit better?

2109
02:57:43,979 --> 02:57:45,979
That's a bit better to me.

2110
02:57:45,979 --> 02:57:47,979
It bothered me very much.

2111
02:57:47,979 --> 02:57:49,979
That's fair.

2112
02:57:49,979 --> 02:57:51,979
So you said C5?

2113
02:57:51,979 --> 02:57:53,979
Yeah, C5.

2114
02:57:53,979 --> 02:57:55,979
You can literally see me.

2115
02:57:55,979 --> 02:57:57,979
I'm going to say F7.

2116
02:57:57,979 --> 02:58:01,059
Incredibly incorrect.

2117
02:58:01,059 --> 02:58:03,059
Fine.

2118
02:58:03,059 --> 02:58:05,739
Where are you going?

2119
02:58:05,739 --> 02:58:09,739
Maybe something in the first column.

2120
02:58:09,739 --> 02:58:11,739
Well, you have to say something.

2121
02:58:11,739 --> 02:58:13,739
D?

2122
02:58:13,739 --> 02:58:16,239
Maybe C1?

2123
02:58:16,239 --> 02:58:18,239
C1 is a hit.

2124
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:20,239
And you literally looked.

2125
02:58:20,239 --> 02:58:22,239
I moved to your left.

2126
02:58:22,239 --> 02:58:24,239
You asked me to move to my left.

2127
02:58:24,239 --> 02:58:26,239
I just happened to move to my left.

2128
02:58:26,239 --> 02:58:28,239
I'm just going to take a random stab in the dark, D1.

2129
02:58:28,239 --> 02:58:30,239
No.

2130
02:58:30,239 --> 02:58:32,239
What?

2131
02:58:32,239 --> 02:58:34,239
There's something on D1.

2132
02:58:34,239 --> 02:58:36,239
First of all, I want to do this real quick.

2133
02:58:36,239 --> 02:58:38,239
Don't move.

2134
02:58:38,239 --> 02:58:40,989
I want everyone to see what I have.

2135
02:58:40,989 --> 02:58:42,989
Show them what I have.

2136
02:58:42,989 --> 02:58:44,989
If you ever have to go to the bathroom and take a shower, feel free to.

2137
02:58:44,989 --> 02:58:46,989
That's where I am and he looked and it's bullshit.

2138
02:58:46,989 --> 02:58:48,989
I've never looked at anything in my life.

2139
02:58:48,989 --> 02:58:51,170
Call me a cheater?

2140
02:58:51,170 --> 02:58:53,170
Yes.

2141
02:58:53,170 --> 02:58:55,170
So when did you move here?

2142
02:58:55,170 --> 02:58:57,170
I moved to 983 Dollhouse Lane.

2143
02:58:57,170 --> 02:58:59,170
983 Dollhouse Lane.

2144
02:58:59,170 --> 02:59:01,170
I've been living in Dollhouse Lane for a while, actually.

2145
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:03,170
I was with my mother.

2146
02:59:03,170 --> 02:59:05,170
I was friends with a man named Ted who passed recently.

2147
02:59:05,170 --> 02:59:08,180
Sad passing, too.

2148
02:59:08,180 --> 02:59:10,180
I came out of nowhere.

2149
02:59:10,180 --> 02:59:12,180
Blindsided us all.

2150
02:59:12,180 --> 02:59:14,180
You weren't there.

2151
02:59:14,180 --> 02:59:16,180
By the way, I had a funeral.

2152
02:59:16,180 --> 02:59:18,180
It was weird.

2153
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:20,180
No, I wasn't.

2154
02:59:20,180 --> 02:59:22,180
I didn't think I had to be there.

2155
02:59:22,180 --> 02:59:24,180
Wasn't he your uncle or something?

2156
02:59:24,180 --> 02:59:26,180
They're just friends.

2157
02:59:26,180 --> 02:59:28,180
My mom is not related.

2158
02:59:28,180 --> 02:59:30,180
You and I are not related at all?

2159
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:32,180
No, my mom's just friends with him.

2160
02:59:32,180 --> 02:59:34,180
I'm going to go F3.

2161
02:59:34,180 --> 02:59:36,180
F3 is just going to be a miss on your end.

2162
02:59:36,180 --> 02:59:38,180
That's fine.

2163
02:59:38,180 --> 02:59:41,379
You don't have to pee yet or anything, right?

2164
02:59:41,379 --> 02:59:43,379
I have had to pee for the last hour, but I'm just going to hold it.

2165
02:59:43,379 --> 02:59:45,379
I like talking to you.

2166
02:59:45,379 --> 02:59:47,379
Okay.

2167
02:59:47,379 --> 02:59:49,379
Let me go with E1.

2168
02:59:49,379 --> 02:59:51,379
E1 is incorrect.

2169
02:59:51,379 --> 02:59:53,379
You already said that last time.

2170
02:59:53,379 --> 02:59:55,379
No, I said D1.

2171
02:59:55,379 --> 02:59:57,379
Oh, well, you were wrong twice.

2172
02:59:59,379 --> 03:00:02,829
Where do you want to go instead?

2173
03:00:02,829 --> 03:00:04,829
You know what? I'll go D2.

2174
03:00:04,829 --> 03:00:06,829
D2? That is a miss.

2175
03:00:06,829 --> 03:00:08,829
You already have a hit.

2176
03:00:08,829 --> 03:00:10,829
Hold on, I've got to get this.

2177
03:00:10,829 --> 03:00:12,829
Yeah, take it.

2178
03:00:12,829 --> 03:00:18,639
Who is calling right now?

2179
03:00:18,639 --> 03:00:21,969
Hello? It's just static.

2180
03:00:21,969 --> 03:00:23,969
I don't know who this is.

2181
03:00:23,969 --> 03:00:31,440
Hello?

2182
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:37,950
What the fuck?

2183
03:00:37,950 --> 03:00:39,950
It was a prank call.

2184
03:00:39,950 --> 03:00:41,950
It could have been a prank call.

2185
03:00:41,950 --> 03:00:43,950
Since we haven't gotten a response, we're giving you...

2186
03:00:43,950 --> 03:00:46,579
Hold on, somebody's there.

2187
03:00:46,579 --> 03:00:48,579
A final courtesy call.

2188
03:00:48,579 --> 03:00:50,579
Before we close out your file,

2189
03:00:50,579 --> 03:00:52,579
I wanted to see if you were available to talk

2190
03:00:52,579 --> 03:00:54,579
for a few minutes.

2191
03:00:54,579 --> 03:00:56,579
If you'd like to speak to a specialist

2192
03:00:56,579 --> 03:00:58,579
concerning extending

2193
03:00:58,579 --> 03:01:00,579
or reinstating your vehicle's warranty,

2194
03:01:00,579 --> 03:01:02,579
press 1 right now

2195
03:01:02,579 --> 03:01:04,579
to speak to a warranty specialist.

2196
03:01:04,579 --> 03:01:06,579
I'd like for you to put me on the do not call list.

2197
03:01:06,579 --> 03:01:08,579
Put me on the do not call list ever again.

2198
03:01:08,579 --> 03:01:10,579
I don't know what that means.

2199
03:01:10,579 --> 03:01:12,579
You're going to put me in a database of people

2200
03:01:12,579 --> 03:01:14,579
that answered the phone,

2201
03:01:14,579 --> 03:01:16,579
so therefore I'm going to get ten times more phone calls.

2202
03:01:16,579 --> 03:01:18,579
The real play is for me to never actually answer the phone.

2203
03:01:18,579 --> 03:01:20,579
Because if I answer the phone, that means they have me

2204
03:01:20,579 --> 03:01:22,579
in the database of people that answered the phone,

2205
03:01:22,579 --> 03:01:24,579
so therefore I'll get more.

2206
03:01:24,579 --> 03:01:27,139
Have a good day. Fuck you.

2207
03:01:27,139 --> 03:01:29,139
What was your move?

2208
03:01:29,139 --> 03:01:31,139
It was C4,

2209
03:01:31,139 --> 03:01:33,139
like the explosive.

2210
03:01:33,139 --> 03:01:35,139
That's a hit.

2211
03:01:35,139 --> 03:01:37,139
C3.

2212
03:01:37,139 --> 03:01:39,139
That's a hit.

2213
03:01:39,139 --> 03:01:41,139
C2.

2214
03:01:41,139 --> 03:01:43,139
That's a hit. You won again.

2215
03:01:43,139 --> 03:01:45,569
I have to pay you $500.

2216
03:01:45,569 --> 03:01:47,569
That's $500.

2217
03:01:47,569 --> 03:01:49,569
This is just for fun.

2218
03:01:49,569 --> 03:01:51,569
That's just for fun.

2219
03:01:51,569 --> 03:01:53,569
That's literally just for fun.

2220
03:01:53,569 --> 03:01:55,569
I guessed it correctly.

2221
03:01:55,569 --> 03:01:57,569
You guessed it correctly, but you didn't even...

2222
03:01:57,569 --> 03:01:59,940
Hold on.

2223
03:01:59,940 --> 03:02:01,940
Sorry, I've just really got to go to the bathroom.

2224
03:02:01,940 --> 03:02:03,940
Yeah, take your time.

2225
03:02:03,940 --> 03:02:05,940
Take your time.

2226
03:02:05,940 --> 03:02:08,299
Well, I can't go yet.

2227
03:02:08,299 --> 03:02:10,299
But I have to go.

2228
03:02:10,299 --> 03:02:12,930
I didn't think it'd be like this when we hung out.

2229
03:02:12,930 --> 03:02:14,930
I didn't even know you lived here. I thought you lived somewhere.

2230
03:02:14,930 --> 03:02:16,930
I don't know you lived here.

2231
03:02:16,930 --> 03:02:18,930
I've always lived in Dollhouse.

2232
03:02:18,930 --> 03:02:20,930
You walked over and I was doing my thing, playing the organ,

2233
03:02:20,930 --> 03:02:22,930
and I didn't know you were here.

2234
03:02:22,930 --> 03:02:24,930
Who are those fucking weirdos, by the way? Is it police?

2235
03:02:24,930 --> 03:02:26,930
It's the police. There's been a bear on the loose.

2236
03:02:26,930 --> 03:02:28,930
Have you had a bear in your house?

2237
03:02:28,930 --> 03:02:30,930
Well, before, yeah.

2238
03:02:30,930 --> 03:02:32,930
You've had a bear come to your front door?

2239
03:02:32,930 --> 03:02:34,930
What else would you do?

2240
03:02:34,930 --> 03:02:36,930
That's what I fucking...

2241
03:02:36,930 --> 03:02:38,930
What would you do?

2242
03:02:38,930 --> 03:02:40,930
I would call the police. But I fought him.

2243
03:02:40,930 --> 03:02:42,930
And I kicked his ass.

2244
03:02:42,930 --> 03:02:44,930
And then he kicked my ass.

2245
03:02:44,930 --> 03:02:46,930
You fought the bear?

2246
03:02:46,930 --> 03:02:48,930
Yeah, I kicked his ass.

2247
03:02:48,930 --> 03:02:50,930
Why would you fight a bear?

2248
03:02:50,930 --> 03:02:52,930
I can't believe this.

2249
03:02:52,930 --> 03:02:54,930
You're saying it with a tone that makes me think you might not...

2250
03:02:54,930 --> 03:02:56,930
I'll be right back.

2251
03:02:56,930 --> 03:02:58,930
Take your time.

2252
03:02:58,930 --> 03:03:00,930
Just hang out this food in the fridge.

2253
03:03:00,930 --> 03:03:15,059
He's so bad.

2254
03:03:15,059 --> 03:03:17,420
Ludwig is in my house right now.

2255
03:03:17,420 --> 03:03:19,420
He's awesome.

2256
03:03:19,420 --> 03:03:21,420
He's a huge streamer. He's fucking really funny and shit.

2257
03:03:21,420 --> 03:03:23,979
I wasn't prepared for this.

2258
03:03:23,979 --> 03:03:28,959
I got a piece so fucking bad,

2259
03:03:28,959 --> 03:03:36,510
you have no idea.

2260
03:03:36,510 --> 03:03:40,159
Please, help me.

2261
03:03:40,159 --> 03:03:44,000
I'll do anything. I really will.

2262
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:49,379
Please let me go to the bathroom.

2263
03:03:49,379 --> 03:03:52,379
Hey!

2264
03:03:52,379 --> 03:03:54,379
Hey!

2265
03:03:54,379 --> 03:03:56,379
How are you? I'm doing good.

2266
03:03:56,379 --> 03:03:58,379
Yay! Cool!

2267
03:03:58,379 --> 03:04:00,379
He's doing good. Awesome.

2268
03:04:00,379 --> 03:04:02,379
How are you doing?

2269
03:04:02,379 --> 03:04:04,379
I'm doing great. It's good to have you here, man.

2270
03:04:04,379 --> 03:04:06,379
It's really good to have you here.

2271
03:04:06,379 --> 03:04:08,379
You seem on edge.

2272
03:04:08,379 --> 03:04:10,379
You want something to drink?

2273
03:04:10,379 --> 03:04:12,379
No, I'm fine.

2274
03:04:12,379 --> 03:04:35,469
Ludwig!

2275
03:04:35,469 --> 03:04:37,469
I got a stereo in here.

2276
03:04:37,469 --> 03:04:39,469
I'm listening to weird music.

2277
03:04:39,469 --> 03:04:45,420
I get that.

2278
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:47,420
I listen to drum solos.

2279
03:04:47,420 --> 03:04:49,420
It kind of feels like you're trying to drum over the sound of your shitting,

2280
03:04:49,420 --> 03:04:51,420
but that makes sense too.

2281
03:04:51,420 --> 03:04:53,420
Drum solos.

2282
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:55,659
Why is the paper this far away?

2283
03:04:55,659 --> 03:04:57,659
Why would the paper be over here?

2284
03:05:03,659 --> 03:05:05,659
This guy's a bit of a psycho.

2285
03:05:05,659 --> 03:05:11,040
Thank God.

2286
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:14,690
That paper is like three feet away.

2287
03:05:14,690 --> 03:05:24,610
Oh yeah.

2288
03:05:24,610 --> 03:05:33,809
Hands washed!

2289
03:05:33,809 --> 03:05:35,809
Ludwig, how are you?

2290
03:05:35,809 --> 03:05:37,809
How are you doing?

2291
03:05:37,809 --> 03:05:39,809
You've done this a couple times.

2292
03:05:39,809 --> 03:05:41,809
Hey, I don't want to stay too long.

2293
03:05:41,809 --> 03:05:43,809
It seems like you've got a lot of shit going on.

2294
03:05:43,809 --> 03:05:45,809
No, not really.

2295
03:05:45,809 --> 03:05:47,809
Just a few things.

2296
03:05:47,809 --> 03:05:49,809
But I'm really happy you came over. I hope you like the place.

2297
03:05:49,809 --> 03:05:53,010
It's cool.

2298
03:05:53,010 --> 03:05:55,010
It's all right.

2299
03:05:55,010 --> 03:05:57,010
It's a low mortgage.

2300
03:05:57,010 --> 03:05:59,010
I got it on a good deal.

2301
03:05:59,010 --> 03:06:01,010
You got a beer?

2302
03:06:01,010 --> 03:06:03,010
Yeah.

2303
03:06:03,010 --> 03:06:05,010
Is that okay?

2304
03:06:05,010 --> 03:06:07,010
I'm just going to help myself.

2305
03:06:07,010 --> 03:06:09,010
It's cool, man.

2306
03:06:09,010 --> 03:06:11,309
I don't want to...

2307
03:06:11,309 --> 03:06:13,309
It's all good, man.

2308
03:06:13,309 --> 03:06:15,309
Sometimes I just got to get some blood pumping.

2309
03:06:15,309 --> 03:06:17,309
Sorry.

2310
03:06:17,309 --> 03:06:20,000
Do I do it with you?

2311
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
You can if you want to.

2312
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
Sometimes I just feel like doing it

2313
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
because I feel like I've got to get some blood going in my body.

2314
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
Maybe you could move this

2315
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
to not be in the middle.

2316
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
That would be a workout.

2317
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
I can't get swole that way.

2318
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
That makes a lot of sense.

2319
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
Hey, it's been a pleasure.

2320
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
Thanks for the money.

2321
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
How many times do I have to pay you every time I see you?

2322
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Don't want to be too forward.

2323
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Maybe it's worth getting a maid around these parts.

2324
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
I know.

2325
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
I thought about that.

2326
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
Weirdly enough, though.

2327
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
Maids are like two grand around here.

2328
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
Well, the sexy ones, but you're not a perv.

2329
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
You wouldn't get those ones.

2330
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
Those are the maids that are like happy ending maids.

2331
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Two grand, though. It's a little high.

2332
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
Well, it's a good ending.

2333
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
End of Code Geass levels.

03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
It's a little high.

2335
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
It's a little high.

2336
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
You okay?

2337
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

2338
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
I'm just getting my socks on.

2339
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
I'll just see myself out.

2340
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
I'll just get my socks on.

2341
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
It was great seeing you.

2342
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
I'll call you.

2343
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
I'll just get my socks on.

2344
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
This guy's a fucking psycho.

2345
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:41,819
I can't sleep.

2346
03:07:41,819 --> 03:07:47,440
Why?

2347
03:07:47,440 --> 03:07:49,440
That was so fucking embarrassing.

2348
03:07:49,440 --> 03:07:52,510
He's really cool.

2349
03:07:52,510 --> 03:07:54,510
You literally just brought in...

2350
03:07:54,510 --> 03:07:56,510
That's one of the coolest dudes I know.

2351
03:07:56,510 --> 03:07:59,200
I'm trying to sleep.

2352
03:07:59,200 --> 03:08:01,200
I'm so tired, but I can't.

2353
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:05,870
Why?

2354
03:08:05,870 --> 03:08:08,299
Why can't I sleep?

2355
03:08:08,299 --> 03:08:11,059
I don't get it.

2356
03:08:11,059 --> 03:16:58,340
I don't...

2357
03:16:58,340 --> 03:17:03,629
It's raining. It's really raining.

2358
03:17:03,629 --> 03:17:05,629
It's like loud rain.

2359
03:17:05,629 --> 03:17:10,049
It's like a thunderstorm.

2360
03:17:10,049 --> 03:17:14,719
Oh, whoa!

2361
03:17:14,719 --> 03:17:16,959
Whoa!

2362
03:17:16,959 --> 03:17:19,520
Whoa! TV!

2363
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:21,520
TV!

2364
03:17:21,520 --> 03:17:28,989
Does it work?

2365
03:17:28,989 --> 03:17:33,600
TV?

2366
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:39,420
How do I turn it on?

2367
03:17:39,420 --> 03:17:43,180
Holy shit!

2368
03:17:43,180 --> 03:17:45,180
A TV!

2369
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:52,270
If I can turn it on.

2370
03:17:52,270 --> 03:17:54,270
Where is it?

2371
03:17:54,270 --> 03:17:56,270
Where is the TV?

2372
03:17:56,270 --> 03:17:58,270
How do I turn it on?

2373
03:17:58,270 --> 03:18:00,959
The rain is so loud.

2374
03:18:00,959 --> 03:18:03,329
TV!

2375
03:18:03,329 --> 03:18:06,909
Oh, whoa!

2376
03:18:06,909 --> 03:18:09,469
Wow!

2377
03:18:09,469 --> 03:18:15,940
TV!

2378
03:18:15,940 --> 03:18:17,940
How do I turn the TV off?

2379
03:18:17,940 --> 03:18:20,180
Oh, cool!

2380
03:18:20,180 --> 03:18:22,180
TV!

2381
03:18:22,180 --> 03:18:24,860
Wow!

2382
03:18:24,860 --> 03:18:27,680
Oh my god!

2383
03:18:27,680 --> 03:18:30,049
TV!

2384
03:18:30,049 --> 03:18:33,379
TV!

2385
03:18:33,379 --> 03:18:35,379
Oh, wow! TV!

2386
03:18:35,379 --> 03:18:45,229
TV!

2387
03:18:45,229 --> 03:18:48,430
That shit's fucked.

2388
03:18:48,430 --> 03:18:51,500
Oh!

2389
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:53,500
Why don't we watch some TV?

2390
03:18:53,500 --> 03:18:56,129
Ah, the beautiful

2391
03:18:56,129 --> 03:18:58,750
rainstorm.

2392
03:18:58,750 --> 03:19:02,399
Take a look outside.

2393
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:05,219
Wow!

2394
03:19:05,219 --> 03:19:07,899
It's coming down out there.

2395
03:19:07,899 --> 03:19:10,139
Holy smokes!

2396
03:19:10,139 --> 03:19:29,340
Time to stream.

2397
03:19:29,340 --> 03:19:36,190
Let's get some stream going here.

2398
03:19:36,190 --> 03:19:38,190
Alright, going live.

2399
03:19:38,190 --> 03:19:41,899
Come check me out.

2400
03:19:41,899 --> 03:19:47,020
And live.

2401
03:19:47,020 --> 03:19:49,020
Hey guys, just started the stream.

2402
03:19:49,020 --> 03:19:53,250
But before I get started, let's run some ads.

2403
03:19:53,250 --> 03:24:53,469
No, I don't see it.

2404
03:24:53,469 --> 03:24:56,989
It's not on the screen.

2405
03:24:56,989 --> 03:25:01,540
That's what you're saying. Thanks for the subs.

2406
03:25:01,540 --> 03:25:03,540
Appreciate it. It's not there though.

2407
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:10,510
I'm not blind. I can't see it.

2408
03:25:10,510 --> 03:25:13,840
There's nothing there.

2409
03:25:13,840 --> 03:25:15,840
There's nothing on the screen.

2410
03:25:15,840 --> 03:25:17,840
I've turned around four times now, okay?

2411
03:25:17,840 --> 03:25:20,020
It's not there.

2412
03:25:20,020 --> 03:25:22,379
Stop fucking with me.

2413
03:25:22,379 --> 03:25:24,379
I'm just getting like gas lit. That's all you guys fucking do.

2414
03:25:24,379 --> 03:25:30,780
I don't know if that's somebody's

2415
03:25:30,780 --> 03:25:32,780
officer's, police officer's driving by or something.

2416
03:25:32,780 --> 03:25:41,540
Yeah.

2417
03:25:41,540 --> 03:25:45,379
That was a siren.

2418
03:25:45,379 --> 03:25:51,200
I don't know if that's a main road. It's a busy road.

2419
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:57,090
Yeah, I got it.

2420
03:25:57,090 --> 03:25:59,090
Ring the doorbell or something.

2421
03:25:59,090 --> 03:26:01,090
Ring the doorbell.

2422
03:26:01,090 --> 03:26:03,329
It's hard to do. I'm freaking blind.

2423
03:26:03,329 --> 03:26:05,329
Can you knock it a couple times?

2424
03:26:05,329 --> 03:26:07,329
Do something, okay?

2425
03:26:07,329 --> 03:26:09,329
I'm freaking blind.

2426
03:26:09,329 --> 03:26:11,329
I'm pretty sure this is the right place.

2427
03:26:11,329 --> 03:26:15,870
Alright, let me show you how it's done, alright?

2428
03:26:15,870 --> 03:26:17,870
Hey, listen.

2429
03:26:17,870 --> 03:26:19,870
This is Sheriff Tony Andrews, I believe we met.

2430
03:26:19,870 --> 03:26:21,870
Yeah, we have.

2431
03:26:21,870 --> 03:26:23,870
We have a stolen TV in the area.

2432
03:26:23,870 --> 03:26:25,870
And the GPS tracking device is showing right here.

2433
03:26:25,870 --> 03:26:27,870
Yeah, the GPS tracking device.

2434
03:26:27,870 --> 03:26:29,870
What's that?

2435
03:26:29,870 --> 03:26:31,870
It's raining.

2436
03:26:31,870 --> 03:26:33,870
Interesting.

2437
03:26:33,870 --> 03:26:35,870
Listen, you're going to have to let us in here, okay?

2438
03:26:35,870 --> 03:26:37,870
We've got to inspect the area.

2439
03:26:37,870 --> 03:26:39,870
It's raining, can you see that?

2440
03:26:39,870 --> 03:26:41,870
Wait, is it raining right here?

2441
03:26:41,870 --> 03:26:43,870
I'm perfectly fine.

2442
03:26:43,870 --> 03:26:45,870
Yeah, that's a stolen what?

2443
03:26:45,870 --> 03:26:47,870
Yeah, you see that stolen TV?

2444
03:26:47,870 --> 03:26:49,870
My GPS says it's right at this location, right?

2445
03:26:49,870 --> 03:26:51,870
How do you have a GPS on a stolen TV?

2446
03:26:51,870 --> 03:26:53,870
Everything has tracking devices.

2447
03:26:53,870 --> 03:26:55,870
We've got to go in here, we've got to go in here.

2448
03:26:55,870 --> 03:26:57,870
Do I seriously go inside, dude?

2449
03:26:57,870 --> 03:26:59,870
Who is this guy?

2450
03:26:59,870 --> 03:27:01,870
He's a serial jaywalker.

2451
03:27:01,870 --> 03:27:03,870
I caught him loitering outside the library a couple minutes ago.

2452
03:27:03,870 --> 03:27:06,620
Listen, dude, you can just call me Snakebite.

2453
03:27:06,620 --> 03:27:08,620
Why are you bringing him in my house?

2454
03:27:08,620 --> 03:27:11,569
What's that?

2455
03:27:11,569 --> 03:27:14,319
It's a TV.

2456
03:27:14,319 --> 03:27:16,319
You see that red dot?

2457
03:27:16,319 --> 03:27:20,540
Yeah.

2458
03:27:20,540 --> 03:27:22,540
You see that TV?

2459
03:27:22,540 --> 03:27:24,540
I got it from second hand, it was second hand.

2460
03:27:24,540 --> 03:27:26,540
And where'd you get it?

2461
03:27:26,540 --> 03:27:28,540
I got it from, it was brought to me by some sleep paralysis demons in the night.

2462
03:27:28,540 --> 03:27:30,540
Sleep paralysis demons?

2463
03:27:30,540 --> 03:27:32,540
Yeah, okay.

2464
03:27:32,540 --> 03:27:34,540
Tell me more about your sleep paralysis demons.

2465
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:36,540
You got any sleep paralysis demons?

2466
03:27:36,540 --> 03:27:38,540
Sleep paralysis, dude?

2467
03:27:38,540 --> 03:27:40,540
It's going down out there, you hear that?

2468
03:27:40,540 --> 03:27:42,540
Yeah, I don't know what you're...

2469
03:27:42,540 --> 03:27:44,540
He's crazy.

2470
03:27:44,540 --> 03:27:46,540
You're a psycho, you know that?

2471
03:27:46,540 --> 03:27:48,540
You think it's raining, you got sleep paralysis demons?

2472
03:27:48,540 --> 03:27:50,540
What do you want to do about the TV?

2473
03:27:50,540 --> 03:27:52,540
Let me ask you something.

2474
03:27:52,540 --> 03:27:54,540
You see that red dot?

2475
03:27:54,540 --> 03:27:57,040
You think that's that TV right there?

2476
03:27:57,040 --> 03:27:59,729
Officer, I don't want a criminal

2477
03:27:59,729 --> 03:28:01,729
just in my house.

2478
03:28:01,729 --> 03:28:03,729
He hasn't officially been arrested yet.

2479
03:28:03,729 --> 03:28:05,729
There's a whole other story.

2480
03:28:05,729 --> 03:28:07,729
This is boring.

2481
03:28:07,729 --> 03:28:09,729
Hold my phone.

2482
03:28:09,729 --> 03:28:11,729
Dude, this is crazy, man.

2483
03:28:11,729 --> 03:28:13,729
Let me just double check something, okay?

2484
03:28:13,729 --> 03:28:15,729
You can look if you want, I don't think there's anything wrong.

2485
03:28:15,729 --> 03:28:19,629
I mean, the TV doesn't work, it broke.

2486
03:28:19,629 --> 03:28:21,629
Yeah, that's the exact serial number with the GPS.

2487
03:28:21,629 --> 03:28:23,629
I didn't buy it, somebody bought it for me.

2488
03:28:23,629 --> 03:28:25,629
It came in here, sleep paralysis demons

2489
03:28:25,629 --> 03:28:27,629
bring shit to me and it takes my name away from my account.

2490
03:28:27,629 --> 03:28:29,629
Do me a favor.

2491
03:28:29,629 --> 03:28:31,629
I'm going to need you to help me pick this up, alright?

2492
03:28:31,629 --> 03:28:33,629
I'm sorry, sir, this is stolen property.

2493
03:28:33,629 --> 03:28:35,629
Unless you want me to...

2494
03:28:35,629 --> 03:28:38,450
You want me to arrest you?

2495
03:28:38,450 --> 03:28:40,450
This is your choice.

2496
03:28:40,450 --> 03:28:42,450
Okay, listen, you want him to take the TV?

2497
03:28:42,450 --> 03:28:44,450
I don't want anyone to take my TV.

2498
03:28:44,450 --> 03:28:46,450
This is my TV, it was brought to me by sleep paralysis demons

2499
03:28:46,450 --> 03:28:48,450
and it gave me the night time

2500
03:28:48,450 --> 03:28:50,450
and they drop shit and they touch my head sometimes.

2501
03:28:50,450 --> 03:28:52,450
They touch your head sometimes?

2502
03:28:52,450 --> 03:28:54,450
By the way, can I just tell you?

2503
03:28:54,450 --> 03:28:56,450
Yeah, what do you want?

2504
03:28:56,450 --> 03:28:58,450
You are probably, I would say,

2505
03:28:58,450 --> 03:29:00,450
probably the most handsome police officer I've ever seen.

2506
03:29:00,450 --> 03:29:02,450
You're aware this is like another dude here, right?

2507
03:29:02,450 --> 03:29:04,450
Like I'm a person, dude.

2508
03:29:04,450 --> 03:29:06,450
I'm sorry, I just...

2509
03:29:06,450 --> 03:29:08,450
The outfit, the uniform...

2510
03:29:08,450 --> 03:29:10,450
I really appreciate that, my mother always told me

2511
03:29:10,450 --> 03:29:12,450
I look good in blue.

2512
03:29:12,450 --> 03:29:14,450
You do look fantastic.

2513
03:29:14,450 --> 03:29:16,450
It's the blue, it's the double blue.

2514
03:29:16,450 --> 03:29:18,450
Listen, maybe we should grab a beer sometime.

2515
03:29:18,450 --> 03:29:20,450
I would absolutely love that.

2516
03:29:20,450 --> 03:29:22,450
I would absolutely love going out for a beer.

2517
03:29:22,450 --> 03:29:24,450
Hey, where'd you put my phone?

2518
03:29:24,450 --> 03:29:26,450
It's in my hands, bro, you made me hold it for you, dude.

2519
03:29:26,450 --> 03:29:28,450
Listen, here's the thing,

2520
03:29:28,450 --> 03:29:30,450
I can either find you for $300...

2521
03:29:30,450 --> 03:29:32,450
Don't find me.

2522
03:29:32,450 --> 03:29:34,450
...and I can say that maybe I didn't see the TV.

2523
03:29:34,450 --> 03:29:36,450
I don't know, but listen, man,

2524
03:29:36,450 --> 03:29:38,450
I'm gonna take the TV either way.

2525
03:29:38,450 --> 03:29:41,780
Well, guess what, officer?

2526
03:29:41,780 --> 03:29:44,530
The TV doesn't fucking work.

2527
03:29:44,530 --> 03:29:46,530
It doesn't work.

2528
03:29:46,530 --> 03:29:48,530
So you broke it?

2529
03:29:48,530 --> 03:29:50,530
You broke the TV.

2530
03:29:50,530 --> 03:29:52,530
You stole the TV and you broke it.

2531
03:29:52,530 --> 03:29:54,530
I just wanted to watch the sports program on it

2532
03:29:54,530 --> 03:29:56,530
and it didn't work.

2533
03:29:56,530 --> 03:29:58,530
It looks like it works a little bit, dude.

2534
03:29:58,530 --> 03:30:00,530
It's just kind of abstract, man.

2535
03:30:00,530 --> 03:30:02,530
You want me to hang this on the wall

2536
03:30:02,530 --> 03:30:04,530
and make it an abstract art painting?

2537
03:30:04,530 --> 03:30:06,530
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to keep your hands

2538
03:30:06,530 --> 03:30:08,530
off the contraband, alright?

2539
03:30:08,530 --> 03:30:10,530
Listen, I'm gonna have to confiscate it.

2540
03:30:10,530 --> 03:30:12,530
We're taking it.

2541
03:30:12,530 --> 03:30:14,530
You go ahead and lift that up for me.

2542
03:30:14,530 --> 03:30:16,530
You expect me to pick up the freaking TV?

2543
03:30:16,530 --> 03:30:18,530
It's part of your community service, son.

2544
03:30:18,530 --> 03:30:20,530
Really?

2545
03:30:20,530 --> 03:30:22,530
Go ahead.

2546
03:30:22,530 --> 03:30:24,530
Good luck.

2547
03:30:24,530 --> 03:30:26,530
Thank you, by the way. Thank you. Appreciate it.

2548
03:30:26,530 --> 03:30:28,530
By the way, like I've got to say before,

2549
03:30:28,530 --> 03:30:30,530
I've said it before again,

2550
03:30:30,530 --> 03:30:32,530
probably the most handsome cop I've ever seen in my life.

2551
03:30:32,530 --> 03:30:34,530
Can we not address the fact that I'm walking backwards?

2552
03:30:34,530 --> 03:30:36,530
Can you pick up the pace a little bit, please?

2553
03:30:36,530 --> 03:30:38,530
Dude, I'm literally going as fast as I can.

2554
03:30:38,530 --> 03:30:40,530
Watch out for the couch.

2555
03:30:40,530 --> 03:30:42,530
Dude, we've got cables all over here.

2556
03:30:42,530 --> 03:30:44,530
This is a major safety risk, dude.

2557
03:30:44,530 --> 03:30:46,530
This is a real jaywalk.

2558
03:30:46,530 --> 03:30:48,530
There's no crosswalk in front of the library, dude.

2559
03:30:48,530 --> 03:30:50,530
What am I supposed to do?

2560
03:30:50,530 --> 03:30:52,530
I've got to get around you for a second.

2561
03:30:52,530 --> 03:30:54,530
Okay, alright.

2562
03:30:54,530 --> 03:30:56,530
Official police business, huh?

2563
03:30:56,530 --> 03:30:58,530
Official police business.

2564
03:30:58,530 --> 03:31:00,530
Dude, this is ridiculous, bro.

2565
03:31:00,530 --> 03:31:02,530
This is silly.

2566
03:31:02,530 --> 03:31:04,530
Can you get a load of that?

2567
03:31:04,530 --> 03:31:06,530
Who is Sleed Peralis, the demon?

2568
03:31:06,530 --> 03:31:08,530
I've never heard of that before, dude.

2569
03:31:08,530 --> 03:31:10,530
Put the TV down for a second.

2570
03:31:10,530 --> 03:31:12,530
Put the TV down for a second.

2571
03:31:12,530 --> 03:31:14,530
Go have a good day, go ahead and take it.

2572
03:31:14,530 --> 03:31:16,530
I'm not paying to find you.

2573
03:31:16,530 --> 03:31:18,530
I don't know if you've heard of Tic-Tac or whatever.

2574
03:31:18,530 --> 03:31:20,530
Don't Tick-Tock me!

2575
03:31:20,530 --> 03:31:22,530
If you're going to Tick-Tock me, fine.

2576
03:31:22,530 --> 03:31:24,530
Are you Tick-Tocking?

2577
03:31:24,530 --> 03:31:26,530
Are you Tick-Tocking now?

2578
03:31:26,530 --> 03:31:32,739
Yeah, I think so. I don't know how it works.

2579
03:31:32,739 --> 03:31:35,549
There, fucking leave, please.

2580
03:31:35,549 --> 03:31:37,549
Alright.

2581
03:31:37,549 --> 03:31:39,549
And I'm the one in handcuffs, bro?

2582
03:31:39,549 --> 03:31:41,549
I'm the one getting arrested?

2583
03:31:41,549 --> 03:31:43,549
You made me watch that.

2584
03:31:43,549 --> 03:31:45,790
Okay.

2585
03:31:45,790 --> 03:31:47,790
This is ridiculous, dude. How far are we carrying this, man?

2586
03:31:47,790 --> 03:31:49,790
Another couple miles, man.

2587
03:31:49,790 --> 03:31:51,790
Another couple miles, bro, dude.

2588
03:31:51,790 --> 03:31:55,629
Now I don't have TV.

2589
03:31:55,629 --> 03:31:58,260
And I smell so awful

2590
03:31:58,260 --> 03:32:00,260
to a point where it's disgusting people.

2591
03:32:00,260 --> 03:32:04,290
And now I don't have TV.

2592
03:32:04,290 --> 03:32:06,290
Why would you get a stolen TV?

2593
03:32:06,290 --> 03:32:08,290
Why? You had so many options.

2594
03:32:08,290 --> 03:32:10,290
Why pick a stolen piece of merchandise?

2595
03:32:10,290 --> 03:32:12,290
And I plugged it in and it didn't work.

2596
03:32:12,290 --> 03:32:19,629
Unbelievable.

2597
03:32:19,629 --> 03:32:21,629
Oh shit, I'm still streaming.

2598
03:32:21,629 --> 03:32:23,629
Hey.

2599
03:32:23,629 --> 03:32:25,629
If anybody's still here.

2600
03:32:25,629 --> 03:32:27,629
Hey.

2601
03:32:27,629 --> 03:32:29,629
So I just had, hey everybody, what's going on?

2602
03:32:29,629 --> 03:32:31,629
Just had a little bit of thing going on.

2603
03:32:31,629 --> 03:32:33,629
Had my TV worked on. Had a handyman come.

2604
03:32:33,629 --> 03:32:35,629
You know, I was trying to get like

2605
03:32:35,629 --> 03:32:37,629
an ultra HD

2606
03:32:37,629 --> 03:32:39,629
screen put into the wall.

2607
03:32:39,629 --> 03:32:41,629
Because you know what I mean? Money.

2608
03:32:41,629 --> 03:32:43,629
I got a lot of it. So ultra HD

2609
03:32:43,629 --> 03:32:45,629
screen going into the wall back there.

2610
03:32:45,629 --> 03:32:47,629
Right in front of the kitchen, too.

2611
03:32:47,629 --> 03:32:49,629
I've got money, you know. I've got money.

2612
03:32:49,629 --> 03:32:52,379
I've got, mute the stream.

2613
03:32:52,379 --> 03:32:54,379
Mute it. I'll be right back.

2614
03:32:54,379 --> 03:33:06,659
Oy yi yi.

2615
03:33:06,659 --> 03:33:10,239
What a pain in the ass. I gotta

2616
03:33:10,239 --> 03:33:12,799
I gotta move.

2617
03:33:12,799 --> 03:33:16,319
This neighborhood is fucked.

2618
03:33:16,319 --> 03:33:18,319
This most ridiculous neighborhood. What an insane

2619
03:33:18,319 --> 03:33:21,069
neighborhood. It's eight.

2620
03:33:21,069 --> 03:33:28,049
I mean, I thought I was a weird guy.

2621
03:33:28,049 --> 03:33:30,479
Do I belong here or should I leave

2622
03:33:30,479 --> 03:33:40,209
here as fast as I can?

2623
03:33:40,209 --> 03:33:43,409
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

2624
03:33:43,409 --> 03:33:48,530
Hey everybody, I'm back.

2625
03:33:48,530 --> 03:33:51,149
I gotta go. I know you've only gotten

2626
03:33:51,149 --> 03:33:53,149
about four minutes of content.

2627
03:33:53,149 --> 03:33:55,149
And like a 62 minute BRB

2628
03:33:55,149 --> 03:33:57,149
screen.

2629
03:33:57,149 --> 03:33:59,149
But, you know, I just

2630
03:33:59,149 --> 03:34:01,149
I'm working on some stuff.

2631
03:34:01,149 --> 03:34:03,149
Make sure to check out tomorrow. There's gonna be

2632
03:34:03,149 --> 03:34:05,149
a dollhouse stream tomorrow.

2633
03:34:05,149 --> 03:34:07,149
I will check it out with you. We've got a lot of work done on it.

2634
03:34:07,149 --> 03:34:09,149
A lot of people were involved. It's gonna be a lot of fun.

2635
03:34:09,149 --> 03:34:11,149
So I'll give you guys a link

2636
03:34:11,149 --> 03:34:13,149
now. I'll give you the link.

2637
03:34:13,149 --> 03:34:15,389
Just send it in. Well, you're here

2638
03:34:15,389 --> 03:34:17,389
already, so that's fine. And I'll see

2639
03:34:17,389 --> 03:34:19,389
you guys tomorrow for the dollhouse stream.

2640
03:34:19,389 --> 03:34:23,040
And goodbye.

2641
03:34:23,040 --> 03:34:25,979
Play the outro. There it is.

2642
03:34:25,979 --> 03:34:29,250
Okay.

2643
03:34:29,250 --> 03:34:31,420
I hate doing this.

2644
03:34:31,420 --> 03:34:33,420
I hate streaming. I fucking can't wait till I'm done.

2645
03:34:33,420 --> 03:34:35,790
Is somebody calling?

2646
03:34:35,790 --> 03:34:45,950
Hello?

2647
03:35:02,510 --> 03:35:04,510
Hello?

2648
03:35:04,510 --> 03:35:06,510
Hello?

2649
03:35:06,510 --> 03:35:08,510
Hello?

2650
03:35:08,510 --> 03:35:10,510
Hello?

2651
03:35:10,510 --> 03:35:12,510
Hello?

2652
03:35:12,510 --> 03:35:14,510
Hello?

2653
03:35:14,510 --> 03:35:16,510
Hello?

2654
03:35:16,510 --> 03:35:18,510
Hello?

2655
03:35:18,510 --> 03:35:20,510
Hello?

2656
03:35:20,510 --> 03:35:22,510
Hello?

2657
03:35:22,510 --> 03:35:24,510
Hello?

2658
03:35:24,510 --> 03:35:26,510
Hello?

2659
03:35:26,510 --> 03:35:28,510
Hello?

2660
03:35:28,510 --> 03:35:30,510
Hello?

2661
03:35:30,510 --> 03:35:33,069
Oh, hang on.

2662
03:35:33,069 --> 03:35:35,069
Does that shit work on people? I don't understand.

2663
03:35:35,069 --> 03:35:38,659
Car warranty?

2664
03:35:38,659 --> 03:35:40,659
I don't have a car.

2665
03:35:40,659 --> 03:35:42,659
I literally don't have a car. I don't own a car.

2666
03:35:42,659 --> 03:35:44,659
How would a car get here?

2667
03:35:44,659 --> 03:35:50,799
I was just in there and I didn't go to the bathroom.

2668
03:35:50,799 --> 03:35:54,379
This place is a mess.

2669
03:35:54,379 --> 03:35:57,459
Disaster.

2670
03:35:57,459 --> 03:35:59,459
TV's gone.

2671
03:35:59,459 --> 03:36:01,459
My friends think I'm a weirdo.

2672
03:36:01,459 --> 03:36:03,459
I barely have anybody I can fucking hang out with.

2673
03:36:03,459 --> 03:36:06,909
What an absolute

2674
03:36:06,909 --> 03:36:16,579
disaster this has been.

2675
03:36:16,579 --> 03:36:18,579
What I'm going to need is I'm going to need the audience to give me some more volume.

2676
03:36:18,579 --> 03:36:20,579
That's what I'm going to need. I'm going to need more volume.

2677
03:36:20,579 --> 03:36:24,030
I need the audience to give me volume

2678
03:36:24,030 --> 03:36:26,030
to let me know what they want to do.

2679
03:36:26,030 --> 03:36:38,690
I thought this was going to be easy.

2680
03:36:38,690 --> 03:36:43,229
I thought this was going to be simple.

2681
03:36:43,229 --> 03:36:46,110
I thought I was going to be able to live here

2682
03:36:46,110 --> 03:36:48,110
uninterrupted, undisturbed.

2683
03:36:48,110 --> 03:36:50,540
That I'd be taken care of by

2684
03:36:50,540 --> 03:36:53,100
600 million people

2685
03:36:53,100 --> 03:36:55,100
watching, you know. There's 600 million people

2686
03:36:55,100 --> 03:36:57,100
here. You're making me look bad.

2687
03:36:57,100 --> 03:37:07,090
I do love this though.

2688
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:11,059
It's a good touch.

2689
03:37:11,059 --> 03:37:13,059
I'm going to have somebody sit in here with you in the bathroom.

2690
03:37:15,059 --> 03:37:19,659
Alright, finally. I'm hungry.

2691
03:37:19,659 --> 03:37:21,659
This is out of the way.

2692
03:37:21,659 --> 03:37:23,659
I'm trying like an extension cord.

2693
03:37:23,659 --> 03:37:25,659
For the TV that I can't use.

2694
03:37:25,659 --> 03:37:28,540
That's great. What do we got?

2695
03:37:28,540 --> 03:37:31,040
We got beer that people keep

2696
03:37:31,040 --> 03:37:34,690
drinking. You know what?

2697
03:37:34,690 --> 03:37:41,790
I think I'm going to go for a slice of bread.

2698
03:37:41,790 --> 03:37:50,110
Or a cookie sandwich.

2699
03:37:50,110 --> 03:38:02,260
Don't put flash

2700
03:38:02,260 --> 03:38:06,350
on the stove, kids.

2701
03:38:06,350 --> 03:38:10,319
Is there blood on this? No.

2702
03:38:10,319 --> 03:38:16,209
You want to see how dirty these are

2703
03:38:16,209 --> 03:38:18,209
over the last like 3 or 4 hours?

2704
03:38:18,209 --> 03:38:22,860
Look at this. It's like I literally was walking

2705
03:38:22,860 --> 03:38:24,860
around in mud.

2706
03:38:24,860 --> 03:38:33,489
These were white.

2707
03:38:33,489 --> 03:38:35,489
I do have to go to the bathroom.

2708
03:38:35,489 --> 03:38:37,860
And I'm tired.

2709
03:38:37,860 --> 03:38:42,190
Very tired.

2710
03:38:42,190 --> 03:38:44,190
Can I sleep in the bed tonight or are we going to make me

2711
03:38:44,190 --> 03:38:46,190
pass out on the toilet while I take a shit and then

2712
03:38:46,190 --> 03:38:49,649
pass out and slash my head on the ground?

2713
03:38:49,649 --> 03:38:52,209
Can we make this a normal day?

2714
03:38:52,209 --> 03:38:54,829
Huh? Huh?

2715
03:38:54,829 --> 03:38:56,829
Normal day. Normal day.

2716
03:38:56,829 --> 03:38:59,139
Bars full.

2717
03:38:59,139 --> 03:39:03,170
I want to go to bed, I want to pee

2718
03:39:03,170 --> 03:39:05,170
and then I want to go to bed. Can we make that happen

2719
03:39:05,170 --> 03:39:10,860
please? Can we?

2720
03:39:10,860 --> 03:39:13,680
I'm trying so hard to not have my arms go up

2721
03:39:13,680 --> 03:39:15,680
because I don't want to see my armpit hairs.

2722
03:39:15,680 --> 03:39:17,680
Because somebody is going to screenshot it and like

2723
03:39:17,680 --> 03:39:19,680
keep it. I don't want you to have that.

2724
03:39:19,680 --> 03:39:23,329
I'm going to the bedroom.

2725
03:39:23,329 --> 03:39:36,700
All I have in my third room

2726
03:39:36,700 --> 03:39:38,700
is like

2727
03:39:38,700 --> 03:39:40,700
stools and a bed.

2728
03:39:40,700 --> 03:39:43,709
I mean the organs out there

2729
03:39:43,709 --> 03:39:45,709
and that's pretty cool. I'm going to go back and play that.

2730
03:39:45,709 --> 03:39:49,729
But like

2731
03:39:49,729 --> 03:39:51,729
give me a fun toy.

2732
03:39:51,729 --> 03:39:54,159
I'll take a second bathroom.

2733
03:39:54,159 --> 03:39:56,979
I don't think that's even possible.

2734
03:39:56,979 --> 03:40:10,659
Thank God.

2735
03:40:10,659 --> 03:40:14,690
This bed smells like Cheez-Its.

2736
03:40:14,690 --> 03:41:12,219
I didn't eat Cheez-Its in here.

2737
03:41:12,219 --> 03:41:14,219
Okay, alright.

2738
03:41:14,219 --> 03:41:16,219
Alright, I need two shadows in here.

2739
03:41:16,219 --> 03:41:18,219
Oh yeah, that's a bad dream for Joyma.

2740
03:41:18,219 --> 03:41:21,170
Hey boys, yeah

2741
03:41:21,170 --> 03:41:23,170
get him up, get him up.

2742
03:41:23,170 --> 03:41:25,170
He's having a bad dream, ain't that right

2743
03:41:25,170 --> 03:41:27,170
big boy?

2744
03:41:27,170 --> 03:41:29,979
You're all alone.

2745
03:41:29,979 --> 03:41:31,979
All alone in your house.

2746
03:41:31,979 --> 03:41:33,979
What, you miss that maid? You miss that cute maid

2747
03:41:33,979 --> 03:41:35,979
from the other day?

2748
03:41:35,979 --> 03:41:37,979
Yeah, get him up.

2749
03:41:37,979 --> 03:41:40,159
Get him up.

2750
03:41:40,159 --> 03:41:42,159
When's the last time you showered

2751
03:41:42,159 --> 03:41:45,170
big boy?

2752
03:41:45,170 --> 03:41:48,690
Okay, come on.

2753
03:41:48,690 --> 03:41:50,690
Yeah, that's it. Get him up.

2754
03:41:50,690 --> 03:41:52,690
Get him in the bathroom.

2755
03:41:52,690 --> 03:41:54,690
Oh, I can smell him from here.

2756
03:41:54,690 --> 03:41:57,059
Come on, both of you.

2757
03:41:57,059 --> 03:41:59,059
I'm not going to get my hands dirty.

2758
03:41:59,059 --> 03:42:01,059
Come on.

2759
03:42:01,059 --> 03:42:03,059
Yeah.

2760
03:42:03,059 --> 03:42:05,620
Big boy Joyma.

2761
03:42:05,620 --> 03:42:07,620
What's this, your game station?

2762
03:42:07,620 --> 03:42:09,620
Oh, take a look at that.

2763
03:42:11,620 --> 03:42:13,620
I can smell it from here.

2764
03:42:13,620 --> 03:42:15,620
What's that, dude?

2765
03:42:15,620 --> 03:42:17,620
You gotta go to the bathroom, big guy.

2766
03:42:17,620 --> 03:42:19,620
Looks to me like you gotta go

2767
03:42:19,620 --> 03:42:21,620
to the bathroom. Someone's not been

2768
03:42:21,620 --> 03:42:23,620
taking care of their needs, boss.

2769
03:42:23,620 --> 03:42:25,620
Get him on the toilet.

2770
03:42:25,620 --> 03:42:28,049
Yeah, that's it.

2771
03:42:28,049 --> 03:42:30,049
Yeah.

2772
03:42:30,049 --> 03:42:32,049
Then Jerma poops himself.

2773
03:42:32,049 --> 03:42:34,049
This is Kensington's class.

2774
03:42:34,049 --> 03:42:36,049
He poops himself in front of everybody.

2775
03:42:36,049 --> 03:42:38,049
No, no, I didn't poop my pants.

2776
03:42:38,049 --> 03:42:40,049
And then a cowboy comes out of the shower.

2777
03:42:40,049 --> 03:42:42,049
You can poop yourself in the shower.

2778
03:42:42,049 --> 03:42:44,049
That'd be embarrassing to poop yourself

2779
03:42:44,049 --> 03:42:46,049
in front of so many people.

2780
03:42:46,049 --> 03:42:48,049
This is Kensington's class.

2781
03:42:48,049 --> 03:42:50,049
And the cowboy's got a sword.

2782
03:42:50,049 --> 03:42:52,049
Yeah, you just pooped yourself.

2783
03:42:52,049 --> 03:42:54,049
You better keep pooping yourself there, boy.

2784
03:42:54,049 --> 03:42:56,049
And then he starts screaming.

2785
03:42:56,049 --> 03:42:58,049
You're pooping.

2786
03:42:58,049 --> 03:43:00,049
Hey, everybody, it's me, Jerma 95.

2787
03:43:00,049 --> 03:43:02,049
You live pooping yourself?

2788
03:43:02,049 --> 03:43:04,049
No. Yeah, you are.

2789
03:43:04,049 --> 03:43:06,049
Yeah, you are.

2790
03:43:06,049 --> 03:43:08,049
You're pooping yourself

2791
03:43:08,049 --> 03:43:10,049
on television. Oh, yeah.

2792
03:43:10,049 --> 03:43:12,049
I bet you like that, big boy.

2793
03:43:14,049 --> 03:43:16,049
I'm about to go live.

2794
03:43:16,049 --> 03:43:18,049
That's a TOS violation.

2795
03:43:18,049 --> 03:43:20,049
That's a TOS violation. What can go live?

2796
03:43:20,049 --> 03:43:22,049
And he gets up again.

2797
03:43:22,049 --> 03:43:24,049
I hear your stomach growling. Get up.

2798
03:43:24,049 --> 03:43:26,049
Kensington before 3 o'clock.

2799
03:43:26,049 --> 03:43:28,049
They get him up and then they go to the kitchen.

2800
03:43:28,049 --> 03:43:30,049
And he doesn't wash his hands, either.

2801
03:43:30,049 --> 03:43:32,049
Oh, disgusting. I wash my hands

2802
03:43:32,049 --> 03:43:34,049
every time. Yeah, sure you do, pal.

2803
03:43:34,049 --> 03:43:36,049
Oh.

2804
03:43:40,049 --> 03:43:42,049
No.

2805
03:43:42,049 --> 03:43:44,049
No, I didn't shit myself.

2806
03:43:46,049 --> 03:43:48,049
I'm a good boy.

2807
03:43:54,049 --> 03:43:56,049
Make the sandwich with you.

2808
03:43:56,049 --> 03:43:58,049
It's your dream, big guy.

2809
03:43:58,049 --> 03:44:00,049
Go make the sandwich.

2810
03:44:00,049 --> 03:44:02,049
Oh, no.

2811
03:44:02,049 --> 03:44:04,049
Make the sandwich with your fucking friend.

2812
03:44:04,049 --> 03:44:06,049
You don't have way back where I'm from.

2813
03:44:06,049 --> 03:44:08,049
And then Jerma woke up.

2814
03:44:08,049 --> 03:44:10,049
Oh, man.

2815
03:44:39,329 --> 03:45:20,670
What the fuck?

2816
03:45:20,670 --> 03:45:32,110
Huh? What am I doing in here?

2817
03:45:32,110 --> 03:45:36,270
Oh, my God.

2818
03:45:36,270 --> 03:45:38,270
You know, when you ever have a dream,

2819
03:45:38,270 --> 03:45:40,270
you ever have a dream where you,

2820
03:45:40,270 --> 03:45:42,270
and you have it, you have it, you have it,

2821
03:45:42,270 --> 03:45:44,270
you ever have it when you have it, you ever have it

2822
03:45:44,270 --> 03:45:46,270
when you have a dream, you have it when you have it and you had it?

2823
03:45:46,270 --> 03:45:55,170
I feel awful.

2824
03:45:55,170 --> 03:46:00,659
Why is this stuff all over here?

2825
03:46:00,659 --> 03:46:02,659
I had this dream, I like,

2826
03:46:02,659 --> 03:46:05,659
I had this fourth grade teacher

2827
03:46:05,659 --> 03:46:07,659
and I like pooped my pants

2828
03:46:07,659 --> 03:46:09,659
in the class, but whatever. You guys don't know that.

2829
03:46:09,659 --> 03:46:11,659
You don't need to know that. Nobody needs to know that here.

2830
03:46:11,659 --> 03:46:14,540
But pretty much the end of the story

2831
03:46:14,540 --> 03:46:16,540
is I had a bad dream about like how people like laughed

2832
03:46:16,540 --> 03:46:18,540
at me, thought I was stupid and like, you know, whatever.

2833
03:46:18,540 --> 03:46:25,440
Ugh.

2834
03:46:25,440 --> 03:46:27,440
What a fucking joke.

2835
03:46:27,440 --> 03:46:29,870
Why is all my stuff everywhere?

2836
03:46:29,870 --> 03:46:31,870
Why is my stuff everywhere?

2837
03:46:31,870 --> 03:46:36,100
And why am I holding two pieces of bread?

2838
03:46:36,100 --> 03:46:41,149
Ay, yi, yi.

2839
03:46:41,149 --> 03:46:47,219
Ugh. That was

2840
03:46:47,219 --> 03:46:49,219
very weird.

2841
03:46:49,219 --> 03:46:51,219
That was very

2842
03:46:51,219 --> 03:46:53,219
weird. That was,

2843
03:46:53,219 --> 03:47:02,370
that was...

2844
03:47:02,370 --> 03:47:06,780
I want to go play the organ.

2845
03:47:06,780 --> 03:47:08,780
At least I'll have some fun.

2846
03:47:08,780 --> 03:47:17,409
Ugh. Do I have any mail?

2847
03:47:17,409 --> 03:47:19,409
I mean, I gotta get rid of this.

2848
03:47:19,409 --> 03:47:22,139
I mean,

2849
03:47:22,139 --> 03:47:25,020
I didn't see that on camera.

2850
03:47:25,020 --> 03:47:28,540
What's in the mail?

2851
03:47:28,540 --> 03:47:31,489
It got

2852
03:47:31,489 --> 03:47:37,440
rain.

2853
03:47:37,440 --> 03:47:45,500
What's in the mail? There's nothing in the mailbox.

2854
03:47:45,500 --> 03:47:50,049
I don't see

2855
03:47:50,049 --> 03:47:52,049
anything in this mailbox. There's nothing

2856
03:47:52,049 --> 03:47:57,170
in the mailbox. There was no mail.

2857
03:47:57,170 --> 03:48:04,850
I'm doing this.

2858
03:48:04,850 --> 03:48:14,049
...

2859
03:48:14,049 --> 03:48:16,049
...

2860
03:48:16,049 --> 03:48:18,989
...

2861
03:48:18,989 --> 03:48:21,170
Public domain music?

2862
03:48:21,170 --> 03:48:24,110
Is that what they said?

2863
03:48:24,110 --> 03:48:26,110
Um, okay.

2864
03:48:26,110 --> 03:48:28,110
...

2865
03:48:28,110 --> 03:48:30,110
...

2866
03:48:30,110 --> 03:48:32,110
...

2867
03:48:32,110 --> 03:48:34,110
...

2868
03:48:34,110 --> 03:48:36,110
...

2869
03:48:36,110 --> 03:48:38,110
...

2870
03:48:38,110 --> 03:48:40,110
...

2871
03:48:40,110 --> 03:48:42,110
...

2872
03:48:42,110 --> 03:48:47,040
...

2873
03:48:47,040 --> 03:48:58,930
...

2874
03:48:58,930 --> 03:49:03,979
Maybe take a shower now.

2875
03:49:03,979 --> 03:49:22,670
That's fucking water.

2876
03:49:27,139 --> 03:49:32,000
Real shower.

2877
03:49:32,000 --> 03:49:34,000
Good thing I have my tennis shot.

2878
03:49:34,000 --> 03:49:54,719
Hey. There we go.

2879
03:49:54,719 --> 03:49:57,409
Nice and clean.

2880
03:49:57,409 --> 03:50:00,420
Ready to take on the day.

2881
03:50:00,420 --> 03:50:10,530
...

2882
03:50:10,530 --> 03:50:13,020
...

2883
03:50:13,020 --> 03:50:16,659
...

2884
03:50:16,659 --> 03:50:21,459
...

2885
03:50:21,459 --> 03:50:24,850
...

2886
03:50:24,850 --> 03:50:27,469
...

2887
03:50:27,469 --> 03:50:31,440
...

2888
03:50:31,440 --> 03:50:33,620
...

2889
03:50:33,620 --> 03:50:36,540
...

2890
03:50:36,540 --> 03:50:40,129
...

2891
03:50:40,129 --> 03:50:42,430
...

2892
03:50:42,430 --> 03:50:44,989
...

2893
03:50:44,989 --> 03:50:50,030
...

2894
03:50:50,030 --> 03:50:53,809
...

2895
03:50:53,809 --> 03:50:55,809
...

2896
03:50:55,809 --> 03:51:02,270
...

2897
03:51:02,270 --> 03:51:10,000
...

2898
03:51:10,000 --> 03:51:13,389
...

2899
03:51:13,389 --> 03:51:16,020
...

2900
03:51:16,020 --> 03:51:18,190
...

2901
03:51:18,190 --> 03:51:20,190
...

2902
03:51:20,190 --> 03:51:22,190
...

2903
03:51:22,190 --> 03:51:24,190
...

2904
03:51:24,190 --> 03:51:26,370
...

2905
03:51:26,370 --> 03:51:28,370
...

2906
03:51:28,370 --> 03:51:30,610
...

2907
03:51:30,610 --> 03:51:32,610
...

2908
03:51:32,610 --> 03:51:34,610
...

2909
03:51:34,610 --> 03:51:36,610
...

2910
03:51:36,610 --> 03:51:41,149
...

2911
03:51:41,149 --> 03:51:43,149
...

2912
03:51:43,149 --> 03:51:45,149
...

2913
03:51:45,149 --> 03:51:47,149
...

2914
03:51:47,149 --> 03:51:49,149
...

2915
03:51:49,149 --> 03:51:51,149
...

2916
03:51:51,149 --> 03:51:53,149
...

2917
03:51:53,149 --> 03:51:55,149
...

2918
03:51:55,149 --> 03:51:57,149
...

2919
03:51:57,149 --> 03:51:59,149
...

2920
03:51:59,149 --> 03:52:01,149
...

2921
03:52:01,149 --> 03:52:03,840
...

2922
03:52:03,840 --> 03:52:08,129
...

2923
03:52:08,129 --> 03:52:10,129
...

2924
03:52:10,129 --> 03:52:12,129
...

2925
03:52:12,129 --> 03:52:14,129
...

2926
03:52:14,129 --> 03:52:16,129
...

2927
03:52:16,129 --> 03:52:18,129
...

2928
03:52:18,129 --> 03:52:20,129
...

2929
03:52:20,129 --> 03:52:26,719
...

2930
03:52:26,719 --> 03:52:28,719
...

2931
03:52:28,719 --> 03:52:32,690
...

2932
03:52:32,690 --> 03:52:34,690
...

2933
03:52:34,690 --> 03:52:39,340
...

2934
03:52:39,340 --> 03:52:41,520
...

2935
03:52:41,520 --> 03:52:43,520
...

2936
03:52:43,520 --> 03:52:45,520
...

2937
03:52:45,520 --> 03:52:49,229
...

2938
03:52:49,229 --> 03:52:51,600
...

2939
03:52:51,600 --> 03:52:55,950
...

2940
03:52:55,950 --> 03:52:57,950
...

2941
03:52:57,950 --> 03:52:59,950
...

2942
03:52:59,950 --> 03:53:01,950
...

2943
03:53:01,950 --> 03:53:03,950
...

2944
03:53:03,950 --> 03:53:15,340
Um, you dropped this.

2945
03:53:15,340 --> 03:53:17,340
Oh, thank you so much.

2946
03:53:17,340 --> 03:53:19,340
Yes. You looking for an outlet?

2947
03:53:19,340 --> 03:53:21,340
Oh, yeah. I think there's...

2948
03:53:21,340 --> 03:53:23,340
I have no idea where one is.

2949
03:53:23,340 --> 03:53:25,340
I think there's one outlet in the whole house.

2950
03:53:25,340 --> 03:53:27,340
There's one right here, sir. Thank you.

2951
03:53:27,340 --> 03:53:29,340
You got it? Yeah, I got it.

2952
03:53:29,340 --> 03:53:38,819
That's a beautiful vacuum cleaner.

2953
03:53:38,819 --> 03:53:40,819
A lot of bathroom usage for you today, sir.

2954
03:53:40,819 --> 03:53:42,819
Almost as beautiful as you.

2955
03:53:42,819 --> 03:53:44,819
What?

2956
03:53:44,819 --> 03:53:47,309
That vacuum is almost as beautiful as you are.

2957
03:53:47,309 --> 03:53:51,920
I mean it. What is it? What's that?

2958
03:53:51,920 --> 03:53:53,920
That's the sweetest thing I've heard all week.

2959
03:53:53,920 --> 03:53:55,920
Thank you. Yeah.

2960
03:53:55,920 --> 03:53:57,920
Can I get a hug? Yes, sure.

2961
03:53:57,920 --> 03:54:03,020
Absolutely. Come here.

2962
03:54:03,020 --> 03:54:05,579
Thank you.

2963
03:54:05,579 --> 03:54:07,889
You need to go to the bathroom. It's right here.

2964
03:54:07,889 --> 03:54:09,889
Thank you for telling me that.

2965
03:54:09,889 --> 03:54:11,889
Yes, of course. Absolutely.

2966
03:54:11,889 --> 03:54:19,309
And you know that I mean it.

2967
03:54:19,309 --> 03:54:21,309
I keep getting this fucking huge migraine.

2968
03:54:21,309 --> 03:54:24,059
And I feel like someone is telling me

2969
03:54:24,059 --> 03:54:26,059
I'm being controlled by something.

2970
03:54:26,059 --> 03:54:30,139
What the fuck?

2971
03:54:30,139 --> 03:54:33,090
I mean, they look good.

2972
03:54:33,090 --> 03:54:36,030
They do. They look good.

2973
03:54:36,030 --> 03:54:44,059
Everything okay in here?

2974
03:54:44,059 --> 03:54:46,059
Yeah, no. Everything's great in here.

2975
03:54:48,059 --> 03:54:50,299
Sorry.

2976
03:54:50,299 --> 03:54:52,299
You might know I'm not that used to cleaning

2977
03:54:52,299 --> 03:54:54,299
up stuff.

2978
03:54:54,299 --> 03:54:56,299
Okay.

2979
03:54:56,299 --> 03:54:58,299
What's the problem?

2980
03:54:58,299 --> 03:55:01,309
What's the problem? Yeah.

2981
03:55:01,309 --> 03:55:03,309
It's a computer. You can just move it out of the way.

2982
03:55:03,309 --> 03:55:05,309
I'm unsure how to clean it, sir.

2983
03:55:05,309 --> 03:55:07,309
Well, just push it out of the way and you can just dust it or something.

2984
03:55:07,309 --> 03:55:09,809
Yeah, I'll be in here. You got it.

2985
03:55:09,809 --> 03:55:12,299
You're fine. Great.

2986
03:55:12,299 --> 03:55:14,299
I'll just move it out of the way.

2987
03:55:14,299 --> 03:55:24,020
Oh, I like what they did with this.

2988
03:55:24,020 --> 03:55:32,590
I gotta go to work.

2989
03:55:32,590 --> 03:55:34,590
Oh, that's not too loud.

2990
03:55:34,590 --> 03:55:36,590
No, it's fine. I gotta go to work. I'll see you later.

2991
03:55:36,590 --> 03:55:38,590
Have a good time. Thank you.

2992
03:55:38,590 --> 03:55:40,590
Again, I want and this might be a little neurotic,

2993
03:55:40,590 --> 03:55:42,590
but I like vertical lines,

2994
03:55:42,590 --> 03:55:44,590
not horizontal. Okay.

2995
03:55:44,590 --> 03:55:46,590
You like vertical lines, not horizontal.

2996
03:55:46,590 --> 03:55:48,590
You get a couch in the middle of your living room.

2997
03:55:48,590 --> 03:55:50,590
You use the computer in your bathroom.

2998
03:55:50,590 --> 03:55:52,590
I woke up and came here and there was a piece of

2999
03:55:52,590 --> 03:55:54,590
toilet paper on the floor. We prefer vertical lines.

3000
03:55:54,590 --> 03:55:57,090
You can do horizontal if you want.

3001
03:55:57,090 --> 03:55:59,329
I would hope.

3002
03:55:59,329 --> 03:56:01,329
Yeah. You can do horizontal.

3003
03:56:05,569 --> 03:56:08,700
Vertical lines.

3004
03:56:08,700 --> 03:56:15,360
You guys are psycho.

3005
03:56:15,360 --> 03:56:17,360
Not very much slack left, by the way.

3006
03:56:26,319 --> 03:56:28,319
Thank God for Uncle Ted, because otherwise

3007
03:56:28,319 --> 03:56:30,319
I would have no fucking money.

3008
03:56:30,319 --> 04:03:39,860
See you later. Goodbye.

3009
04:03:39,860 --> 04:03:42,100
That was a good day. I feel pretty good about that day.

3010
04:03:42,100 --> 04:03:44,340
Hungry. Thirsty.

3011
04:03:44,340 --> 04:03:47,899
Ready. But I made some money.

3012
04:03:47,899 --> 04:03:50,659
That's good, right? Still kind of a mess out there.

3013
04:03:50,659 --> 04:03:53,340
I really wish the...

3014
04:03:53,340 --> 04:03:55,340
I really wish...

3015
04:03:55,340 --> 04:03:57,340
Goodbye. Yep. See you later.

3016
04:03:57,340 --> 04:03:59,340
I didn't press it.

3017
04:03:59,340 --> 04:04:01,579
I gotta get that doorbell

3018
04:04:01,579 --> 04:04:03,579
looked at. I need like an electrician.

3019
04:04:03,579 --> 04:04:10,100
Okay. Why is this

3020
04:04:10,100 --> 04:04:14,000
open? Why is this open?

3021
04:04:14,000 --> 04:04:23,840
Ugh. It looks pretty

3022
04:04:23,840 --> 04:04:26,530
clean in here. Not bad.

3023
04:04:26,530 --> 04:04:28,770
I mean, it could be a little better, but

3024
04:04:28,770 --> 04:04:43,860
whatever.

3025
04:04:43,860 --> 04:04:45,860
Hi.

3026
04:04:45,860 --> 04:04:48,459
Um. How dare you

3027
04:04:48,459 --> 04:04:50,459
just walk in when I'm cleaning?

3028
04:04:50,459 --> 04:04:52,459
The shoes are in the bed? What?

3029
04:04:52,459 --> 04:04:54,459
You had your shoes on. I took them off. I'm not a psycho.

3030
04:04:54,459 --> 04:04:56,459
I don't sleep with my shoes on. But you took your shoes off

3031
04:04:56,459 --> 04:04:58,459
and the shoes were in the bed with you. Why were they not

3032
04:04:58,459 --> 04:05:00,459
on the side of the bed? Because I was cleaning the bed and I put

3033
04:05:00,459 --> 04:05:02,459
them on the side of the bed. You weren't here for that.

3034
04:05:02,459 --> 04:05:04,459
Anyway, it took me a little bit longer today, so it's going to

3035
04:05:04,459 --> 04:05:07,090
be $300.

3036
04:05:07,090 --> 04:05:09,090
Okay. Um. Is that because you slept

3037
04:05:09,090 --> 04:05:11,090
in the room, or is that because you do... You don't

3038
04:05:11,090 --> 04:05:13,260
talk to me like that.

3039
04:05:13,260 --> 04:05:15,260
Um, no, I was...

3040
04:05:15,260 --> 04:05:17,260
Amelia, it was...

3041
04:05:17,260 --> 04:05:19,260
It's fine. I was just saying, like

3042
04:05:19,260 --> 04:05:21,260
I come from work and you're in bed. I picked up a piece of toilet paper

3043
04:05:21,260 --> 04:05:23,260
with poop on it, but I'm the one to blame.

3044
04:05:23,260 --> 04:05:26,079
There's been more than one person here.

3045
04:05:26,079 --> 04:05:28,079
There's been at least four people here. I found a pair of

3046
04:05:28,079 --> 04:05:30,379
pants with poop on it. Did you poop

3047
04:05:30,379 --> 04:05:32,879
yourself? I'm wearing the same

3048
04:05:32,879 --> 04:05:34,879
pants I was five days

3049
04:05:34,879 --> 04:05:36,879
ago. That's even more concerning.

3050
04:05:36,879 --> 04:05:38,879
And by the way, I

3051
04:05:38,879 --> 04:05:40,879
may have pooped my pants, but

3052
04:05:40,879 --> 04:05:42,879
goodness gracious, I mean,

3053
04:05:42,879 --> 04:05:44,879
you look great.

3054
04:05:44,879 --> 04:05:46,879
And I think that you and I could probably

3055
04:05:46,879 --> 04:05:48,879
maybe go out sometime.

3056
04:05:48,879 --> 04:05:50,879
Well, I don't know. I'll see what I'm doing

3057
04:05:50,879 --> 04:05:52,879
tomorrow. Let's call it $300

3058
04:05:52,879 --> 04:05:54,879
and I'll be on my way. Sure, $300.

3059
04:05:54,879 --> 04:05:56,879
Great. Hey.

3060
04:05:56,879 --> 04:05:58,879
It's been great. It's been fantastic.

3061
04:05:58,879 --> 04:06:00,879
We should go out sometime.

3062
04:06:00,879 --> 04:06:02,879
You want to go out sometime?

3063
04:06:02,879 --> 04:06:04,879
Well, I just said I might be free tomorrow.

3064
04:06:04,879 --> 04:06:06,879
Yeah, but like, I got

3065
04:06:06,879 --> 04:06:08,879
a wild schedule. Can I confirm

3066
04:06:08,879 --> 04:06:11,250
it? Sure. Okay.

3067
04:06:11,250 --> 04:06:13,250
I don't think I want to shake

3068
04:06:13,250 --> 04:06:15,250
your hand after you said you pooped yourself.

3069
04:06:15,250 --> 04:06:17,250
How about this one? Great.

3070
04:06:17,250 --> 04:06:27,409
Yeah! Woohoo!

3071
04:06:27,409 --> 04:06:40,770
Got a date!

3072
04:06:40,770 --> 04:06:42,770
You know, there are, there are,

3073
04:06:42,770 --> 04:06:44,770
um, there are

3074
04:06:44,770 --> 04:06:47,139
three to four options

3075
04:06:47,139 --> 04:06:49,139
when you get a choice.

3076
04:06:49,139 --> 04:06:51,139
You know, there's a few

3077
04:06:51,139 --> 04:06:53,139
different things you can choose from each time.

3078
04:06:53,139 --> 04:06:55,500
Not sure you're aware of

3079
04:06:55,500 --> 04:06:59,979
that at this point. I feel pretty good.

3080
04:06:59,979 --> 04:07:01,979
I feel pretty good. I feel pretty good.

3081
04:07:01,979 --> 04:07:04,159
Although I'm very hungry.

3082
04:07:04,159 --> 04:07:07,100
Oh!

3083
04:07:07,100 --> 04:07:18,879
Can I eat something?

3084
04:07:18,879 --> 04:07:24,940
What are you going to do? I saw

3085
04:07:24,940 --> 04:07:26,940
mine, that's the first time I've looked at chat in like

3086
04:07:26,940 --> 04:07:28,940
four plus hours or so. I saw

3087
04:07:28,940 --> 04:07:31,440
minus twos. Thank you.

3088
04:07:31,440 --> 04:07:46,670
It looks the same

3089
04:07:46,670 --> 04:07:48,670
loaf of bread every time.

3090
04:07:48,670 --> 04:07:57,120
This bread has lasted a long

3091
04:07:57,120 --> 04:08:05,180
time. I hope

3092
04:08:05,180 --> 04:08:07,180
my hands are really clean. I've been cleaning them.

3093
04:08:07,180 --> 04:08:11,860
I'm actually glad I'm wearing these gloves

3094
04:08:11,860 --> 04:08:14,540
because, I mean,

3095
04:08:14,540 --> 04:08:16,540
they're just, they're absolutely gross, but I really

3096
04:08:16,540 --> 04:08:21,600
am happy I have them on.

3097
04:08:21,600 --> 04:08:23,600
I have an apple too. Why would I not eat the apple?

3098
04:08:23,600 --> 04:08:43,680
I want to hang out in here.

3099
04:08:43,680 --> 04:08:50,399
Ah! Ah! I'm going to sit down.

3100
04:08:50,399 --> 04:08:53,409
God! You work all

3101
04:08:53,409 --> 04:08:55,409
day. You come back.

3102
04:08:55,409 --> 04:08:59,309
You just want to sit on your bed.

3103
04:08:59,309 --> 04:09:01,309
Why were they sleeping in here?

3104
04:09:01,309 --> 04:09:07,780
I could have paid you hundreds of dollars

3105
04:09:07,780 --> 04:09:10,020
to sleep in the bed.

3106
04:09:10,020 --> 04:09:13,020
Like, I wonder how, I was gone

3107
04:09:13,020 --> 04:09:15,020
for six and a half hours.

3108
04:09:15,020 --> 04:09:17,020
I bet you they were sleeping in this bed before.

3109
04:09:17,020 --> 04:09:28,459
What?

3110
04:09:28,459 --> 04:09:31,540
I'm not going to, I'm not

3111
04:09:31,540 --> 04:09:36,079
smelling anything.

3112
04:09:36,079 --> 04:09:38,079
In fact, I want this bed

3113
04:09:38,079 --> 04:09:40,079
fucking removed from the house.

3114
04:09:40,079 --> 04:09:49,870
All right, let's do some Twitch TV

3115
04:09:49,870 --> 04:09:55,870
streaming.

3116
04:09:55,870 --> 04:10:08,850
Every time. Okay.

3117
04:10:08,850 --> 04:10:10,850
Let's go. Get these,

3118
04:10:10,850 --> 04:10:12,850
I got to get at least one off, right?

3119
04:10:12,850 --> 04:10:18,420
Okay, let's go live.

3120
04:10:18,420 --> 04:10:22,899
So, we're going to do some

3121
04:10:22,899 --> 04:10:25,389
Germacraft, some Minecraft.

3122
04:10:25,389 --> 04:10:27,389
I'm going to call this episode one.

3123
04:10:27,389 --> 04:10:29,389
Live Germacraft.

3124
04:10:29,389 --> 04:10:36,100
And let's go live.

3125
04:10:36,100 --> 04:10:38,719
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

3126
04:10:38,719 --> 04:10:40,719
Germa here with episode one

3127
04:10:40,719 --> 04:10:42,719
of Germacraft.

3128
04:10:42,719 --> 04:10:44,719
You know, of course, the series where I play Minecraft.

3129
04:10:44,719 --> 04:10:46,719
And it's going to be really fun.

3130
04:10:46,719 --> 04:10:48,719
It's going to be a lot of trials, a lot of triumphs,

3131
04:10:48,719 --> 04:10:50,719
a lot of fails. And

3132
04:10:50,719 --> 04:10:54,739
uh,

3133
04:10:54,739 --> 04:18:29,200
that was a funny

3134
04:18:29,200 --> 04:18:31,950
dream.

3135
04:18:31,950 --> 04:18:33,950
So, by the

3136
04:18:33,950 --> 04:18:35,950
way, before I turn the stream off, everybody, I just want to say,

3137
04:18:35,950 --> 04:18:37,950
um, if you

3138
04:18:37,950 --> 04:18:40,379
go to Germa985.com,

3139
04:18:40,379 --> 04:18:42,379
we've got

3140
04:18:42,379 --> 04:18:44,379
merchandise for you, we've got posters

3141
04:18:44,379 --> 04:18:46,379
for you, we've got all kinds of things you can get, and

3142
04:18:46,379 --> 04:18:48,379
some of them might even be signed, too.

3143
04:18:48,379 --> 04:18:51,069
Oh, sorry, I'm talking to you guys, too.

3144
04:18:51,069 --> 04:18:53,069
Have a good day.

3145
04:18:53,069 --> 04:18:55,069
I'm not even online. The stream's been off for like the last

3146
04:18:55,069 --> 04:19:00,510
three hours. I'm going to be banned for two days.

3147
04:19:00,510 --> 04:19:04,100
Am I going to get permanently banned

3148
04:19:04,100 --> 04:19:06,100
from Twitch if I do that again?

3149
04:19:06,100 --> 04:19:08,100
Just don't do that again. I actually might not be able

3150
04:19:08,100 --> 04:19:10,100
to stream again. If you want, like, income,

3151
04:19:10,100 --> 04:19:18,670
don't do that.

3152
04:19:18,670 --> 04:19:23,659
So that's what I heard. Ah, cool!

3153
04:19:23,659 --> 04:19:25,659
A bunk bed!

3154
04:19:25,659 --> 04:19:37,100
Oh! It's another

3155
04:19:37,100 --> 04:19:39,100
mystery box! Oh my

3156
04:19:39,100 --> 04:19:41,100
goodness, I wonder what's in this one!

3157
04:19:41,100 --> 04:19:43,659
God, you give people

3158
04:19:43,659 --> 04:19:45,659
a loot box option, and that's what they're going to pick

3159
04:19:45,659 --> 04:19:47,659
like three out of ten times, which would be 30%,

3160
04:19:47,659 --> 04:19:49,659
which is not that much. I mean like five out of ten,

3161
04:19:49,659 --> 04:19:51,659
which would be fifty. How about let's go eight out of ten?

3162
04:19:51,659 --> 04:20:00,620
You couldn't have put

3163
04:20:00,620 --> 04:20:02,930
anything else in there, in here.

3164
04:20:02,930 --> 04:20:04,930
You couldn't have put like rubber duckies or something.

3165
04:20:04,930 --> 04:20:06,930
It's three more stools?

3166
04:20:06,930 --> 04:20:08,930
This is the biggest bait ever.

3167
04:20:08,930 --> 04:20:10,930
People would probably be pissed.

3168
04:20:10,930 --> 04:20:16,479
Okay, I'm...

3169
04:20:16,479 --> 04:20:18,479
Alright, well...

3170
04:20:18,479 --> 04:20:21,489
Let's get this out of the way.

3171
04:20:21,489 --> 04:20:23,489
I heard an explosion in

3172
04:20:23,489 --> 04:20:28,479
this room. This bed is...

3173
04:20:28,479 --> 04:20:31,100
I'm moving this.

3174
04:20:31,100 --> 04:20:33,100
Get this out of the way. I'm putting

3175
04:20:33,100 --> 04:20:37,389
this over here.

3176
04:20:37,389 --> 04:20:39,389
Let me at least get this correct here.

3177
04:20:39,389 --> 04:20:45,340
Decorate? Yeah, I can do that.

3178
04:20:45,340 --> 04:20:48,799
Although I do have to pee, so

3179
04:20:48,799 --> 04:20:50,799
I would do that soon.

3180
04:20:50,799 --> 04:20:53,860
Um...

3181
04:20:53,860 --> 04:20:55,860
Can I get rid of the box part of the decoration?

3182
04:20:55,860 --> 04:21:01,229
Where would I want the bed?

3183
04:21:01,229 --> 04:21:04,430
I definitely don't want

3184
04:21:04,430 --> 04:21:06,430
the bed in front of the door. That would be a pain in the ass.

3185
04:21:06,430 --> 04:21:10,139
Let's go with over here.

3186
04:21:10,139 --> 04:21:13,340
Probably against the wall. I want it against the wall.

3187
04:21:13,340 --> 04:21:16,670
That makes more sense to me.

3188
04:21:16,670 --> 04:21:25,889
That looks good. Why would you have a bed

3189
04:21:25,889 --> 04:21:29,729
like over here?

3190
04:21:29,729 --> 04:21:32,799
I like that. It's a twin bed.

3191
04:21:32,799 --> 04:21:34,799
I don't have to worry about the other side. Who cares?

3192
04:21:34,799 --> 04:21:39,090
Alright, then what about the mystery box?

3193
04:21:39,090 --> 04:21:44,590
We can put that in the corner.

3194
04:21:44,590 --> 04:21:47,280
And then I'll put the...

3195
04:21:47,280 --> 04:21:50,030
I'll put these in the...

3196
04:21:50,030 --> 04:21:53,100
I don't know. What am I supposed to do with these?

3197
04:21:53,100 --> 04:21:58,739
What a shitty bedroom.

3198
04:21:58,739 --> 04:22:01,170
This looks like I'm still moving

3199
04:22:01,170 --> 04:22:03,340
into this house.

3200
04:22:03,340 --> 04:22:10,940
How about two over there,

3201
04:22:10,940 --> 04:22:13,889
and two over here.

3202
04:22:13,889 --> 04:22:17,090
Good.

3203
04:22:17,090 --> 04:22:19,090
I have to pee real bad, like right now.

3204
04:22:19,090 --> 04:22:22,930
How about on top of the

3205
04:22:22,930 --> 04:22:26,510
mystery box?

3206
04:22:26,510 --> 04:22:30,670
Beautiful day outside. Beautiful day.

3207
04:22:30,670 --> 04:22:33,360
I want one of these next to the

3208
04:22:33,360 --> 04:22:35,860
bed so I can put my legs over.

3209
04:22:35,860 --> 04:22:39,440
That makes sense to me.

3210
04:22:39,440 --> 04:22:41,440
There couldn't have been anything else in that box.

3211
04:22:41,440 --> 04:22:48,159
Anything else.

3212
04:22:48,159 --> 04:22:50,159
I don't know what to do with these.

3213
04:22:50,159 --> 04:22:52,159
I don't even have a shelf

3214
04:22:52,159 --> 04:22:54,590
to put anything on.

3215
04:22:54,590 --> 04:22:56,590
That's there. That can just stay there.

3216
04:22:56,590 --> 04:22:58,899
I don't care.

3217
04:22:58,899 --> 04:23:01,389
That's fine. That can stay.

3218
04:23:01,389 --> 04:23:03,950
How does it look? You like it?

3219
04:23:03,950 --> 04:23:06,639
What do you think?

3220
04:23:06,639 --> 04:23:16,940
Thank you.

3221
04:23:16,940 --> 04:23:18,940
Yes, yes, yes.

3222
04:23:18,940 --> 04:23:20,940
This is nice, 985. This is a wonderful,

3223
04:23:20,940 --> 04:23:22,940
wonderful place. Thank you for letting me be.

3224
04:23:22,940 --> 04:23:24,940
I appreciate it. Do you think we should try?

3225
04:23:24,940 --> 04:23:26,940
I don't see why we shouldn't.

3226
04:23:26,940 --> 04:23:28,940
I think it'll make sense.

3227
04:23:28,940 --> 04:23:30,940
It's even in tune.

3228
04:23:30,940 --> 04:23:32,940
This is perfect. Wonderful.

3229
04:23:32,940 --> 04:23:34,940
Why don't we start off with some 985?

3230
04:23:34,940 --> 04:23:36,940
We'll practice 985?

3231
04:23:36,940 --> 04:23:38,940
985. That sounds good.

3232
04:23:38,940 --> 04:23:40,940
Let's do that. 985.

3233
04:23:40,940 --> 04:23:44,780
I'm trying something new.

3234
04:23:44,780 --> 04:23:46,780
Alright.

3235
04:23:46,780 --> 04:23:50,110
Go ahead.

3236
04:23:50,110 --> 04:23:54,459
Or get outside.

3237
04:23:54,459 --> 04:23:56,459
God our

3238
04:23:56,459 --> 04:23:58,459
father.

3239
04:23:58,459 --> 04:24:00,700
He's our daddy.

3240
04:24:02,700 --> 04:24:05,200
He's our

3241
04:24:05,200 --> 04:24:07,200
friend.

3242
04:24:07,200 --> 04:24:09,200
He's our friend.

3243
04:24:09,200 --> 04:24:12,459
He's our hand.

3244
04:24:12,459 --> 04:24:18,670
Father, not daddy.

3245
04:24:18,670 --> 04:24:20,670
Sorry about that.

3246
04:24:20,670 --> 04:24:22,670
Sorry about that.

3247
04:24:22,670 --> 04:24:24,670
Hello.

3248
04:24:24,670 --> 04:24:26,670
Excuse me.

3249
04:24:26,670 --> 04:24:28,670
Edna, how are you?

3250
04:24:28,670 --> 04:24:30,670
I'm doing great. Who are you?

3251
04:24:30,670 --> 04:24:32,670
Jerma,

3252
04:24:32,670 --> 04:24:34,670
you were here a few days ago?

3253
04:24:34,670 --> 04:24:36,670
You came here last week?

3254
04:24:36,670 --> 04:24:38,670
Jerma, we heard you had this wonderful

3255
04:24:38,670 --> 04:24:40,670
organ.

3256
04:24:40,670 --> 04:24:42,670
I heard how impressive your organ was.

3257
04:24:42,670 --> 04:24:44,670
And I just wanted to come over and play

3258
04:24:44,670 --> 04:24:46,670
with your organ. With my

3259
04:24:46,670 --> 04:24:48,670
choir, of course, from church.

3260
04:24:48,670 --> 04:24:50,670
Bless you.

3261
04:24:50,670 --> 04:24:52,670
Bless you too.

3262
04:24:52,670 --> 04:24:54,670
If you want to join in.

3263
04:24:54,670 --> 04:24:56,670
Would you like to join in?

3264
04:24:56,670 --> 04:24:58,670
Why don't you just stick around

3265
04:24:58,670 --> 04:25:00,670
and see what happens.

3266
04:25:00,670 --> 04:25:02,670
Step on over with them. That'll be great.

3267
04:25:02,670 --> 04:25:04,670
Your organ is so big I'll have to use two

3268
04:25:04,670 --> 04:25:06,670
hands. Here we go.

3269
04:25:06,670 --> 04:25:08,670
I think you use two hands to play an organ.

3270
04:25:08,670 --> 04:25:10,670
I don't think you play an organ with one

3271
04:25:10,670 --> 04:25:12,670
hand. It's not like a flute.

3272
04:25:12,670 --> 04:25:14,670
Over here?

3273
04:25:14,670 --> 04:25:16,670
Let's take it from the top.

3274
04:25:16,670 --> 04:25:18,670
From the top of where?

3275
04:25:18,670 --> 04:25:20,670
You'll figure it out.

3276
04:25:20,670 --> 04:25:22,670
What page are we on?

3277
04:25:22,670 --> 04:25:25,360
God came

3278
04:25:25,360 --> 04:25:27,360
down from the land.

3279
04:25:27,360 --> 04:25:29,360
God came

3280
04:25:29,360 --> 04:25:31,360
down from the land.

3281
04:25:31,360 --> 04:25:33,360
And he took

3282
04:25:33,360 --> 04:25:35,360
us all by the hand.

3283
04:25:35,360 --> 04:25:37,360
And he took

3284
04:25:37,360 --> 04:25:39,360
us all by the hand.

3285
04:25:39,360 --> 04:25:41,360
And then

3286
04:25:41,360 --> 04:25:43,360
we started

3287
04:25:43,360 --> 04:25:45,360
dancing.

3288
04:25:45,360 --> 04:25:48,180
And then we started

3289
04:25:48,180 --> 04:25:50,180
dancing.

3290
04:25:50,180 --> 04:25:52,420
He's got the spirit.

3291
04:25:52,420 --> 04:25:54,420
Remix.

3292
04:25:54,420 --> 04:25:56,420
Remix.

3293
04:25:56,420 --> 04:25:58,420
God came down to the land

3294
04:25:58,420 --> 04:26:00,420
in the land. God came down

3295
04:26:00,420 --> 04:26:02,420
to the land in the land.

3296
04:26:02,420 --> 04:26:04,420
I can't believe what's happening right now.

3297
04:26:04,420 --> 04:26:06,420
I can't believe what's

3298
04:26:06,420 --> 04:26:08,420
happening right now.

3299
04:26:08,420 --> 04:26:10,420
Oh, okay.

3300
04:26:10,420 --> 04:26:12,420
And he came down to the...

3301
04:26:12,420 --> 04:26:14,420
Why don't you lead us in it?

3302
04:26:14,420 --> 04:26:16,420
And he came down to the

3303
04:26:16,420 --> 04:26:18,420
land. And he came

3304
04:26:18,420 --> 04:26:20,420
down to the land.

3305
04:26:20,420 --> 04:26:22,420
And he...

3306
04:26:22,420 --> 04:26:24,420
He ate...

3307
04:26:24,420 --> 04:26:26,420
He brought wine

3308
04:26:26,420 --> 04:26:28,420
and sand. And he

3309
04:26:28,420 --> 04:26:30,420
brought wine and sand.

3310
04:26:30,420 --> 04:26:32,420
And then he

3311
04:26:32,420 --> 04:26:34,420
left my

3312
04:26:34,420 --> 04:26:36,420
front yard. And then he

3313
04:26:36,420 --> 04:26:38,420
left my front yard.

3314
04:26:38,420 --> 04:26:40,420
They went in the fridge

3315
04:26:40,420 --> 04:26:42,420
and he got himself a nice big tub of lard.

3316
04:26:42,420 --> 04:26:44,420
And went to the fridge

3317
04:26:44,420 --> 04:26:46,420
and got a big tub of lard.

3318
04:26:46,420 --> 04:26:48,420
And the...

3319
04:26:48,420 --> 04:26:50,420
Get you drunk.

3320
04:26:50,420 --> 04:26:52,420
On God's love.

3321
04:26:52,420 --> 04:26:54,420
What the fuck is happening?

3322
04:26:54,420 --> 04:26:56,420
On God's love.

3323
04:26:56,420 --> 04:26:58,420
On God's love.

3324
04:26:58,420 --> 04:27:00,420
On God's...

3325
04:27:00,420 --> 04:27:02,420
God bless you all.

3326
04:27:02,420 --> 04:27:04,420
Is he done?

3327
04:27:04,420 --> 04:27:06,420
Get you drunk?

3328
04:27:06,420 --> 04:27:10,899
That was beautiful.

3329
04:27:10,899 --> 04:27:12,899
But that's my organ and I'd like for you all to leave.

3330
04:27:12,899 --> 04:27:14,899
Well, we would like our book back.

3331
04:27:14,899 --> 04:27:17,709
Unless you, of course, would like to study on your own.

3332
04:27:17,709 --> 04:27:19,709
We'll save it for you at the church and you can come

3333
04:27:19,709 --> 04:27:21,709
sing with us any time.

3334
04:27:21,709 --> 04:27:23,709
Alright. Wonderful.

3335
04:27:23,709 --> 04:27:25,709
Bless you. And bless this house.

3336
04:27:25,709 --> 04:27:27,709
Thank you. Please actually do that a few times.

3337
04:27:27,709 --> 04:27:29,709
Because there's been a lot of fucking weirdos here.

3338
04:27:29,709 --> 04:27:32,399
Bye now. Bye now.

3339
04:27:32,399 --> 04:27:36,299
Have a great day!

3340
04:27:36,299 --> 04:27:38,299
Alright.

3341
04:27:38,299 --> 04:27:40,299
I hope one day they're ready.

3342
04:27:48,620 --> 04:27:50,620
But wait, wait a minute. Wait a second.

3343
04:27:50,620 --> 04:27:53,180
Hey, wait, wait a minute!

3344
04:27:53,180 --> 04:27:55,549
Wait, I really want that book.

3345
04:27:55,549 --> 04:27:57,549
I want that book.

3346
04:27:57,549 --> 04:27:59,549
I think the book... Can I have one of those books?

3347
04:27:59,549 --> 04:28:01,549
Yes, sir. Thank you so much.

3348
04:28:01,549 --> 04:28:03,549
I'd love one of these books. Can I keep it?

3349
04:28:03,549 --> 04:28:05,549
Yes, you may. You probably should.

3350
04:28:05,549 --> 04:28:07,549
What passage should I

3351
04:28:07,549 --> 04:28:09,549
read from to get rid of bears

3352
04:28:09,549 --> 04:28:11,549
and people that I don't want in the house?

3353
04:28:11,549 --> 04:28:13,549
Jeremiah 9

3354
04:28:13,549 --> 04:28:15,549
8 5 is actually my favorite chapter.

3355
04:28:15,549 --> 04:28:17,549
Okay.

3356
04:28:17,549 --> 04:28:19,549
Here.

3357
04:28:19,549 --> 04:28:21,549
I'll put it in the mailbox.

3358
04:28:21,549 --> 04:28:23,549
Yes, probably good.

3359
04:28:23,549 --> 04:28:25,729
He'll find it.

3360
04:28:25,729 --> 04:28:27,729
And he'll find his way home.

3361
04:28:27,729 --> 04:28:29,729
Yes, we have.

3362
04:28:29,729 --> 04:28:31,729
Good job, sister. Very good.

3363
04:28:31,729 --> 04:28:35,700
I hope they're still there.

3364
04:28:35,700 --> 04:28:48,819
I really hope they're still here.

3365
04:28:48,819 --> 04:28:59,489
What an embarrassment.

3366
04:28:59,489 --> 04:29:07,739
I don't want to play this too loud because they'll come back.

3367
04:29:07,739 --> 04:29:09,739
I'm fucking hungry. I'm tired.

3368
04:29:09,739 --> 04:29:11,739
And I have not showered.

3369
04:29:11,739 --> 04:29:24,659
You hear that? Thank you.

3370
04:29:24,659 --> 04:29:40,909
How does she not know who I am?

3371
04:29:40,909 --> 04:29:42,909
She was here like fucking a week ago.

3372
04:29:42,909 --> 04:29:47,260
That's over budget of farting.

3373
04:29:47,260 --> 04:29:52,379
That's definitely over fart budget.

3374
04:29:52,379 --> 04:29:59,549
Better.

3375
04:29:59,549 --> 04:30:03,649
Thank goodness.

3376
04:30:03,649 --> 04:30:10,110
Oh yeah.

3377
04:30:10,110 --> 04:30:19,700
I brush my teeth every time I get in the shower.

3378
04:30:19,700 --> 04:30:21,700
Every time.

3379
04:30:21,700 --> 04:30:24,000
It saves like two minutes each day.

3380
04:30:24,000 --> 04:30:26,750
That's too over budget.

3381
04:30:26,750 --> 04:30:29,500
That's too many.

3382
04:30:29,500 --> 04:30:34,110
I know it's fun to do that.

3383
04:30:34,110 --> 04:30:36,110
But

3384
04:30:36,110 --> 04:30:38,930
no, I know it's really,

3385
04:30:38,930 --> 04:30:40,930
don't just get them all out of your system right now.

3386
04:30:40,930 --> 04:30:42,930
I'll shit in the shower.

3387
04:30:42,930 --> 04:30:47,860
Get them out of your system.

3388
04:30:47,860 --> 04:31:08,530
You need a lot of characters in your time.

3389
04:31:08,530 --> 04:31:11,469
But character development

3390
04:31:11,469 --> 04:31:13,469
and internal characterization of yourself

3391
04:31:13,469 --> 04:31:15,469
is very important.

3392
04:31:15,469 --> 04:31:17,780
The more you think about who you are as a person

3393
04:31:17,780 --> 04:31:19,780
and what you do, the deeds you do,

3394
04:31:19,780 --> 04:31:21,780
that's how you can shape

3395
04:31:21,780 --> 04:31:24,399
yourself as a person.

3396
04:31:24,399 --> 04:31:26,399
Or if you want to know,

3397
04:31:26,399 --> 04:31:28,399
fill words to make yourself sound intelligent.

3398
04:31:28,399 --> 04:31:34,739
Oh, should I have a date?

3399
04:31:34,739 --> 04:31:38,510
I have a date with a maid.

3400
04:31:38,510 --> 04:31:41,459
Fuck.

3401
04:31:41,459 --> 04:31:44,459
Right now?

3402
04:31:44,459 --> 04:31:46,459
I don't want to bail on Amelia.

3403
04:31:46,459 --> 04:31:57,790
That would be a mistake.

3404
04:31:57,790 --> 04:32:00,989
I'm just so tired.

3405
04:32:00,989 --> 04:32:02,989
They'll understand.

3406
04:32:02,989 --> 04:32:04,989
It's fine.

3407
04:32:04,989 --> 04:32:07,680
This is too comfy.

3408
04:32:07,680 --> 04:32:11,010
Another time.

3409
04:32:11,010 --> 04:40:04,720
I'll text them.

3410
04:40:04,720 --> 04:40:08,349
Kind of comfy, but what did I miss?

3411
04:40:08,349 --> 04:40:13,970
Oh, I had a date.

3412
04:40:13,970 --> 04:40:24,659
It's okay.

3413
04:40:24,659 --> 04:40:27,020
Oh, my back hurts.

3414
04:40:27,020 --> 04:40:30,159
You can't sleep sitting down.

3415
04:40:30,159 --> 04:40:40,770
Not bad. I felt worse.

3416
04:40:40,770 --> 04:40:53,860
Okay.

3417
04:40:53,860 --> 04:40:58,340
Uh, had a bed

3418
04:40:58,340 --> 04:41:01,659
already. Hungry.

3419
04:41:01,659 --> 04:41:03,659
This is not very stable, by the way.

3420
04:41:03,659 --> 04:41:06,860
I'm not sure I can sleep on this.

3421
04:41:06,860 --> 04:41:09,229
I already had a bed.

3422
04:41:09,229 --> 04:41:11,229
Is that a bed sandwich?

3423
04:41:11,229 --> 04:41:16,029
That's alright.

3424
04:41:16,029 --> 04:41:22,939
I had a better bed

3425
04:41:22,939 --> 04:41:24,939
in my dorm room in college than this.

3426
04:41:24,939 --> 04:41:31,779
Ugh. I'm hungry.

3427
04:41:31,779 --> 04:41:43,150
Ugh. Can I make

3428
04:41:43,150 --> 04:41:46,419
some food, please?

3429
04:41:46,419 --> 04:41:57,470
Am I making something to eat?

3430
04:41:57,470 --> 04:42:00,540
I'm so hungry.

3431
04:42:00,540 --> 04:42:05,150
I am starving.

3432
04:42:05,150 --> 04:42:07,150
Does it matter? Can I eat? I don't want to eat bread

3433
04:42:07,150 --> 04:42:09,389
for a seventh time.

3434
04:42:09,389 --> 04:42:16,430
I really don't. Here.

3435
04:42:16,430 --> 04:42:20,020
You know what? We're doing hot dogs.

3436
04:42:20,020 --> 04:42:22,639
What do I got? Do I have hot dogs?

3437
04:42:22,639 --> 04:42:24,639
No. We're doing butter and eggs.

3438
04:42:24,639 --> 04:42:40,509
My favorite. That was very loud.

3439
04:42:40,509 --> 04:42:43,709
There.

3440
04:42:43,709 --> 04:42:48,939
Ow. Not bad.

3441
04:42:48,939 --> 04:42:55,069
Not bad.

3442
04:42:55,069 --> 04:42:57,069
A few minutes. Another 30 seconds or so.

3443
04:42:57,069 --> 04:43:02,000
Should be ready to eat.

3444
04:43:02,000 --> 04:43:04,819
There we are. Need another cup.

3445
04:43:04,819 --> 04:43:06,819
