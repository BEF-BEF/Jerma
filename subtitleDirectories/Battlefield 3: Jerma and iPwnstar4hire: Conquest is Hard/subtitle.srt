00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,480
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Battlefield 3 video.

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,219
My first ever Battlefield 3 video and it happens to be with somebody very very special.

3
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:26,260
I'm playing with iPoneStar4Hire. This is all going to be a live commentary, just kind of us messing around in Conquest.

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,960
Just a small series of clips I put together all live, like I said, us just having a good time, messing around.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,659
I'm a total noob at this game. This is like the first or second time I've actually really sat down to play the game.

6
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:43,079
So keep that in mind when you're watching these clips I guess.

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,210
The live commentary should be coming in right about now.

8
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,210
One down. Oh my god!

9
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,210
I'm just like, this is pretty much like Jerma follows PoneStar and watches him destroy everything.

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,210
I'm down for that. They do.

11
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,909
Whoa, is that us or is that not us?

12
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:04,909
I don't know.

13
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:06,909
That's not us, that's not us.

14
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,909
That's not us.

15
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,909
That is definitely not us.

16
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,909
I got the T-90, I don't even know what that is.

17
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:19,200
It's got like, pillows on the back of it.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Alright, do you want me to just spawn or spawn on it?

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Spawn back to the cocktail. I'm going to fucking take that tank out.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
He's coming behind us, behind us.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Oh fuck!

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
We got away.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
He's still coming after us I think.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Bitch, let's go swimming.

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,900
Oh my god. Are we really going that way?

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
We're going swimming, man.

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,900
There's a letter over here, we gotta go capture our letters.

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
This game is ridiculous.

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,900
There's so many letters in the alphabet, I'm just used to seeing A, B, or C, or A, B.

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,900
They go up to F in Battlefield?

31
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
G? Are you kidding me?

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,079
That's cool.

33
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,079
You gotta go back and forth, it's like going crazy on these.

34
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,079
We start at F and we go backwards.

35
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,439
I gotcha, I gotcha.

36
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,140
I don't know how smart it is to walk prone backwards with your nuts on the concrete.

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,219
Should we be expecting people to come from one of these areas?

38
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:14,389
I don't know, I don't play Conquest.

39
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:16,389
I can't fly, oh fuck, what's going on?

40
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:20,389
I think I just stepped on a piece of wood or some bubble wrap.

41
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,389
Oh shit, it's happening again.

42
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,389
Where is he?

43
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,629
Somebody's shooting at us.

44
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,629
Dude, the bubble wrap assassin, where is he?

45
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,330
It's a sniper, it's a sniper.

46
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,330
I really am legit scared right now.

47
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,330
I'm more scared right now than I have been in Resident Evil.

48
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,330
Hold me.

49
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,330
Dude, he's gonna get one of us in a couple seconds and we're gonna be toast.

50
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,330
Oh shit.

51
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,330
Why am I shooting at it?

52
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,330
I'm just hiding.

53
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,330
Where are you?

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,030
I'm coming, I'm coming, hold on.

55
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,030
No, no, he got me.

56
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,460
Oh god, dude.

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,460
No, they're gonna take our G back.

58
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,460
No, I don't want to die.

59
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Wait, it says I suicided.

60
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,460
I just got RPG'd in the water.

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Wait, so what if I just shoot him?

62
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,009
What if I just shoot him over and over again?

63
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,009
I will save you.

64
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,009
I'm just literally firing at the tank over and over again.

65
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,009
I got my knife out, I'm gonna charge him.

66
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:28,009
Look here.

67
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,710
Hold on, hold on, I'm throwing a grenade.

68
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,710
Grenade, out.

69
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,710
It landed on it.

70
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,710
Imagine if it just took it out.

71
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,710
Stay alive, I'm gonna C4, I'm gonna come back in and C4 this.

72
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,009
Wait, I can revive you.

73
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,009
No, there's not enough time, I'm dead.

74
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:45,009
And you're about to be too.

75
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:47,009
I'm just gonna throw health at him.

76
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:49,009
You're gonna throw health at him?

77
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,009
Oh shit, I'm about to get ran over.

78
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,009
What are these guys doing?

79
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:56,659
Oh man, we're making the...

80
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:59,030
Kaboom.

81
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,729
Why am I climbing a ladder and there's nothing up here?

82
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,729
Look at this.

83
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,729
I climbed a ladder with nothing, you're climbing it too.

84
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,729
What is going on?

85
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,729
What is this?

86
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,729
Hey, the suburb.

87
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,729
Here's a little Humvee, you wanna go get in it and look like a boss?

88
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,729
Here, I'm gonna get in it and you get in it too.

89
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,730
You can drive it and cap shit.

90
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,730
Oh shit.

91
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,730
Just a good time to let you know I don't have my license.

92
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,730
So what, are we just like...

93
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,100
This is really uncomfortable.

94
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
I'm in the driver's seat, I look to my left, I see a flag.

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I look to my right and all I can see is your crotch.

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Grandpa crotch.

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
What? Yep.

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
Why are we the only one capturing flags?

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
I know, I mean really.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Look at the...

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Wait, where is he?

102
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm going the other way, I'm not going at it.

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Look at the scoreboard.

104
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Me and you are number one and two and we've done absolutely like nothing.

105
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Besides like, well we took out that tank.

106
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Oh shit.

107
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Oh dude, it's bumper cars.

108
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,860
Oh come on.

109
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Oh dude, you're gonna make me sick.

110
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
I got this.

111
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,310
Sit there and wait for him.

112
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,310
Wait, I'll back that ass up.

113
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,310
I don't think he's coming.

114
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,310
Are you getting points on this? Yeah, I think so.

115
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,310
I'll leave you here. Wait what?

116
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,310
Where are you going? I got you.

117
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,310
Get that guy.

118
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,490
How is he not dead?

119
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm out of bullets.

120
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,490
Fuck you. I ran through him.

121
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,490
Oh my god.

122
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,490
Oh shit, here it is.

123
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,490
Watch this shit, yo.

124
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,490
Alright, I'm watching, let's see this.

125
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,490
Run like fuck.

126
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,490
Yeah.

127
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,490
That was awesome.

128
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,180
So where are you?

129
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Where did you go?

130
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,180
You'll find me on the floor in pieces.

131
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,180
He's on a roof.

132
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Who the fuck is on a roof?

133
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,180
There I come with the paddles.

134
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
You got enough? You got enough time? Hurry up.

135
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,180
Oh shit, he's on this roof up here.

136
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,180
There he is.

137
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,180
Smoke him.

138
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,180
Suck it big boy.

139
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Up here they're taking our D flag.

140
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,540
Not for long.

141
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,540
I hear big guns. I don't know if that's ours or theirs.

142
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,540
I think we have a tank now.

143
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
I don't know if that's particularly ours.

144
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Shoot the guy in the gunner seat.

145
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,540
Don't lure him.

146
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,540
He's dead. The guy in the gunner seat is dead.

147
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Oh man.

148
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
That was awesome.

149
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Where's my body?

150
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Oh my god, Jesus.

151
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,680
You fell with the rail with your face first and grinded that shit.

152
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Dude, that was like a montage worthy clip right there that you just did.

153
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,060
That is going to wrap up this video guys.

154
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,060
Thank you so much for watching.

155
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
I really do appreciate it.

156
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
Hopefully in the next couple of weeks I can get better at Battlefield 3.

157
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
But yeah, we'll see where that goes.

158
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,060
Take care everybody.

159
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,060
I will see you all soon.
