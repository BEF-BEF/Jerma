00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,679
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some binding of Isaac, Wrath of the

2
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,859
Lamb DLC. Now, before the video gets going, you're probably wondering, Jerma, why are

3
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,859
you post-comming this game? This is very much a should-be-doing-alive comma, a let's play

4
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:28,600
or something like that. And the reason behind that is I want to do a breakdown of the DLC

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,399
and tell you all the new things because there's not really a whole lot of press about this.

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,659
And I'm not sure why because this game is incredibly, incredibly well done. And I never

7
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:43,229
did a video explaining what this game actually was, but I will do that as well in this video.

8
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:48,310
So the Binding of Isaac is sort of an action RPG. It's really the only thing you can think

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:55,469
of. It's sort of like a cross between Zelda and Star Tropics and Diablo and there's so

10
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,149
many different genres of game in this game. So it's very hard to describe it. But there

11
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:05,829
is one thing that you need to know if you buy this game. If you die one time, you have

12
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:11,090
to start over from the very beginning. And they call those rogue-like RPGs. So if you

13
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,569
die, you start from the beginning. And how you start this game, how you play this game,

14
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:19,209
is you go through randomly generated rooms. Room to room, you have to clear all the monsters,

15
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,569
just like in Star Tropics or Zelda. So you clear all the monsters in the room, you get

16
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:25,129
to move on to the next room and the next room and the next room. And finally, there is a

17
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:30,730
boss at the end and you go down deeper into the dungeon. Now you do this until you complete

18
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,049
the whole game. And like I said, if you die halfway through, there are no checkpoints.

19
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:40,290
You end up starting over at the very beginning with none of your required items and none

20
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,390
of your required extra health globes. Now you might be wondering to yourself, well,

21
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,730
that sounds great. That sounds fun. But why would you ever want to play that game more

22
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,189
than one or two times in a row? You might see everything you want to see within the

23
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:55,870
first couple of times. Well, that's because of the item system in this game. So during

24
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,549
the course of the playthrough, you're going to find randomly generated items. There are

25
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:07,189
this DLC, there are over 235 randomly generated items that have many different properties

26
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,590
to them. Some make you shoot faster. Some make you do more damage. Some actually do

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,610
worse things. They take your health away. They bring your range down. There are a lot

28
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,629
of different variables and that's why this game is so addicting. And not to mention what

29
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:26,349
it does to your character, because every single item in this game adds something to your character

30
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:30,349
or takes it away. Let's put it this way. If you get something called toothpicks, which

31
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,870
is a new item in the DLC, it literally pries your character's eyes open with toothpicks.

32
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,990
It is very gruesome and very ridiculous, but every single item does something to your character

33
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,490
model that no other item in the game does. And very, very subtly, this game has become

34
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,219
one of my favorite PC games of all time. It's just so addicting. It's so much fun. Oh,

35
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,819
you died halfway through with this amount of items and these amount of things. It's

36
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,900
okay cause you can start over again and get a totally new experience. Okay, so now that

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,020
you heard me praise the game and how much I love it so much, let's talk about the DLC,

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:14,949
the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. Should you get this DLC? Yes. Apsa positiva lutely, yes.

39
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:21,550
It is only $3, $2.99 on the Steam store right now. And the game itself is only five. So

40
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,349
the whole entire package is only eight bucks for hours and hours and hours and hours of

41
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:33,590
enjoyable content. I have spent $60 on some games that are not nearly as fun or nearly

42
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:40,259
as time-sync as this game. And that's a really good thing. So now I'm talking about the content

43
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:46,580
of the DLC. This is not the Binding of Isaac 2. They just added a bunch of new items, new

44
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,960
content to expand on the replayability of the original game. Now that is not a bad thing.

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,099
That is an incredible thing because here's what they did. So there used to be about 135

46
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,539
items. There are now over 100 new ones. So now there's 235 plus. There's five new chapters

47
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:09,780
to the game to play through. Over 20 new enemies, 25 new achievements, 15 new bosses, 6 new

48
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:17,360
room types, 5 new music tracks from that guy Danny B, who is an incredibly talented musician.

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,240
A new item type called trinkets that it's a passive ability. You can only have one of

50
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,600
them at a time. There are new unlockable characters. There's a ton of new secrets, some of which

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,990
I don't even know. I've only played through it about two times now, and there's so much

52
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,800
more stuff that I cannot wait to see. So yes, if you own the Binding of Isaac, go buy this

53
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,160
DLC right now. Because if you love that game, it only makes the game 10 times more interesting.

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,639
And like I said, it's only $3 for this expansion. So I mean, I spend that money every day on

55
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,680
cheeseburgers with Burger Boy anyways. So might as well use it to get some fun. So before

56
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,560
I end the video, I do have to bring this up because it is obviously very, very apparent.

57
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,160
This game is incredibly graphic. There are a lot of violent images, a lot of disturbing

58
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:12,319
images. So viewer discretion is strongly advised when you're going to pick up this game. And

59
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,040
if you're wondering what type of videos I'm going to be doing for Wrath of the Lamb, I'm

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,639
probably going to stream this game. So I'll probably intertwine this between Diablo III,

61
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,509
King Fortress 2, Binding of Isaac, GTA. So this will end up being part of the stream

62
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:32,410
team, I guess. So yeah, that wraps up this video, guys. Go enjoy this game. If you have

63
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,569
it already, then right on. But I'll see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
