1
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:13,640
Why, hello there. How are you? How you doing? Moving the ice cube around in my drink. Hold on.

2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:25,429
This is a big ice cube. I like big ice cubes though. Who cares? Hi, welcome to another stream.

3
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:39,189
Me, Jerma. How you doing? Who cares? How big are the ice cubes? All right, the best part about a

4
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:47,750
huge ice cube is it takes so long to melt. That doesn't dilute your drink. How do I feel? Okay,

5
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:59,270
so I feel... Let me go over my sort of COVID story, I guess. So, I think I'm over it. I have

6
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,510
to test again to see if I'm still kind of shedding the virus, but I lost my sense of taste and smell

7
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,430
for a little while, which that's scary, because who knows with that, right? I'm still a little

8
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,329
sloppy. I would say I'm not sick anymore. I have a residual cough, like kind of deep in my throat,

9
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:25,609
in my kind of chest area, but I wouldn't say that I am sick. I was sick. I'm definitely,

10
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:35,829
I'm definitely over it, but maybe not completely. Yeah, I just kind of feel sloppy. But yeah,

11
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:43,129
I'm doing better. And here we are. We are going to do a couple things today. Well, couple by one,

12
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,239
I have a very important thing to talk about with Origin. I told you and everyone thought I was

13
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:58,409
crazy, but it was true. So, today we're going to play The Sims 4. No mods, no additional modded

14
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:05,260
content. And I think there's a couple of reasons why. Every single time I've played The Sims on

15
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,990
stream, an hour goes by and people start killing each other. That's my, that's every single one of

16
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:21,240
my streams for The Sims. So, I've never really experienced any of these expansions. And I got

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,500
a lot of them. I have almost everything. So, if I have the mods installed, I'm going to be tempted

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,610
to use them. And that includes like the funny faces mods. I want to do a vanilla Sims 4 with

19
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:46,580
every expansion play. I won't, I can't ever do it. It's like playing GTA and you get through the

20
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,990
second or third story mission and then you just start doing the cheats and you don't even play

21
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,870
the rest of the game. You just run around and just fly around with like the mods and stuff.

22
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:04,300
I don't even play the game. This man doesn't know that non-murder mods exist. I know, but

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,639
I cannot install the like the drug mod yet. Which by the way, if you, and I will say this,

24
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,939
the hardest I've ever laughed in the ever that I've ever streamed. If you want to know the one time,

25
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:25,240
I think I've said it before, the hardest I've ever laughed on stream to a point where it physically

26
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,120
caused me discomfort and hurt me. I don't know if there's any clips of it. It was a long time ago.

27
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:36,840
It was a guy was on drugs with the drug mod and he walked his dog in his house

28
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,349
and the dog like pissed on the ground. It started like rolling around in it.

29
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,629
I know that that whole concept was just unbelievable that you would put like, oh,

30
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:57,939
put like the leash on the dog and walk your dog in your house. I think that's the, I think that

31
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:02,500
gave me a hernia. I think that's the day that I got it and it developed. I actually believe that.

32
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:11,189
I remember having to wheel away from the computer because it hurts so much to even be in this room.

33
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,399
And that was a lot, not this room. That was a long time ago. You can't get a hernia like that.

34
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,889
I don't know, man. This, this hiatal hernia that I have, I feel like I gave it to myself somehow.

35
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,350
Can you start playing? We're just hanging out for a second. Hold on.

36
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:40,310
You're going to play The Sims 2. We played The Sims 2 earlier this year.

37
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,980
I don't know. Do I, this is where I'm going to leave this up to you to help me.

38
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:53,110
I don't think I'm, I'm just going to make some random guy, right? I was going to make a random

39
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,910
person. I don't think I wanted to be like, oh, making like Jerma and it's going to be like the

40
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,310
Jerma house. No, no, no. We're just going to, we're going to pick a guy and we're going to play as

41
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:12,730
random guy. I've done the, hey, it's Jerma playing in The Sims, Jerma985. I've done that like 10 times.

42
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:24,730
We played all of them except for two. What? Didn't I play The Sims 2 earlier this year?

43
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:32,420
That was, that was The Sims. No, it was The Sims 2. But I don't know what I want to do because I,

44
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:42,660
it's overwhelming and I got to say something to Origin and EA. Guys, why is there, why is there

45
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,939
not an option? Should I even do this? I feel like everyone's waiting for me to do this.

46
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:54,629
Is everybody waiting for this? Everyone's like leaning back. Here he goes. He's going to,

47
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,470
he's going to talk about there's no cart on Origin for 20 minutes. I feel like everyone

48
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,519
just leaned back and was waiting. Do I need to, I don't think I even need to do this right now.

49
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,800
No, I don't think so. I'm going to, okay, I'll do it in one sentence instead of like 25 sentences.

50
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,920
So we're going to do that in one sentence instead of doing a 25 sentence explanation of what I mean

51
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:22,600
by this. So here comes the one sentence to explain this and it goes as follows. There is no add to

52
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,360
cart option when you're trying to buy shit on Origin for The Sims. There's like a hundred things

53
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,319
to buy individually. There's no Omega bundles. There's bundles with like three things in it out

54
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:45,290
of a hundred. How is there no cart? How is it? I just don't get it. And people said, dude, just

55
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:51,689
buy it on Steam. Listen, I already bought like five or six expansions on Origin. So I was like,

56
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:58,089
I guess I'll just do it on Origin. And I had to, I had to tell my bank, I got texted by my bank.

57
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,930
Hey, we've declined purchases. There's like all these like fraudulent purchases going through the

58
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:13,670
EA store. Like, no, that's me. That's me and it's dumb. I was individually buying every one of these

59
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:19,350
things. I was, dude, I was sitting there. I thought I was crazy. I'm like, there has to be a different

60
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:25,589
way to do this on Origin. I was like looking up like adding things to cart Origin. I don't, why?

61
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:32,629
You have to go through the checkout process on each individual. Oh, one sentence. Shit.

62
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm sorry. Oh my God. I didn't, I didn't realize I was doing that. All right. All right. All right.

63
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,560
All right. All right. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done.

64
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,480
Fuck. Oh, I'm like embarrassed. That was at least 20 sentences. That was more than 25. Okay. All

65
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,259
right. All right. All right. Enough, enough, enough. We're going to play The Sims 4.

66
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,850
Oh shit. You know, it's like, you just know that you just get called out with something

67
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:16,939
and it's completely true and it just makes you angry. No. Hey, we got to take, we're going to

68
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,990
take the dollhouse out of the, out of the title. People are going to see German dollhouse and

69
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,670
they're going to go, what? This is another dollhouse. Oh, we got to get that out of the title.

70
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:38,389
Okay. Hold on. Origin doesn't have a shopping cart like that. Items are all purchased one

71
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,870
time for the origin store. The only exception would be the build your own bundle option.

72
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:54,149
What? Build your own bundle. Build your own bundle. Where is that? Where is build your own bundle?

73
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:05,269
Is this a pizza place? What do you mean build your own bundle? The bundle is three items at once

74
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:14,379
though. Build your own bundle. I don't, if it's available, it's not advertised at all.

75
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:23,960
I was looking for it everywhere. All right. Okay. I can one of the mods change that title

76
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,000
to something that I spent two hours individually buying all these DLCs. You better enjoy. That's

77
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,120
better. Build your own bundle. I'm so annoyed and I'm going to get over it. All right. So let's go.

78
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:49,210
And I know I'm going to get the comments of like, Oh dude, but like, Oh yeah. You just want to be

79
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,850
able to click one button and spend a thousand dollars. It's like, I, I don't want to do that.

80
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:01,049
I just want to add stuff to cards. I don't need like the, the kitten costume pack. I don't want

81
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:04,090
that. I just want the stuff that I want, but I don't want to individually buy every single one

82
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:12,059
of them. But I think, you know what? I think I did buy like the pet costume pack. I don't know why,

83
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:21,340
but I did. He said we get started and people are going to be, I got to, I'm going to preemptively

84
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:28,620
tell you this. Um, just so you understand. Yes. Yes, there is. It is a, it is a different. Did I

85
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:46,039
tweet? Did I tweet this yet? I did. All right. What's on the screen? Jesus. All right. Here comes a

86
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,320
new game and let me turn the camera on. Everyone's going to freak out. All right. Okay. Everyone's

87
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,059
going to lose their mind. Yes. It is a new angle. It's a new, there is a new camera angle today and

88
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:59,740
people are going to think there's like a, there's a monster's not coming out of this door. I just

89
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,539
want to make sure everyone understands. I'm not in a new, this is not a new house. This is not a new

90
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:13,000
place. And a monster's not coming out of this door. Okay. Why are you so red? Because I'm a,

91
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,080
I don't know. I've, I've, I don't know. Where's the red shelf? It's, I'm going to put something

92
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,389
here instead. I just, I wanted to change some shit around. I wanted to move the room around.

93
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:30,759
You know, when you just kind of feel like, you know, the room is getting stale, the room's a

94
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,279
little stale. I want to make this better, right? You just kind of have to change it up. That's how

95
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,669
it happened. Anyways, is the camera delayed? Somebody's saying the camera's behind. It really

96
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:57,100
shouldn't be. Let's find out why. Is it behind? And audio slightly. Really? That's weird. Is it

97
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:10,759
behind? Maybe not. I just don't think I move my lips that much sometimes when I talk. The audio's

98
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:20,059
behind. Is it? That's weird. I don't know. I don't know why I can do this, but I can. I can't escape.

99
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:30,139
All right, let's go. Can you hear it? You guys can hear it, right? All right. We're going to,

100
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:33,500
we're going to make a sim and we're going to play. I don't know. There's like werewolves and shit.

101
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:44,740
I got the werewolf expansion. I don't know what to do. Okay. So hello. We'll do the name last.

102
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:52,360
And should there be more than one person in this house? Skip 10 hours. We're not going to spend,

103
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,360
I'm telling you, I promise we're going to spend 20 minutes in the character creator, maybe 15

104
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:21,700
total. Maybe. I already kind of like it. You need to have a dog too. I don't want to do a bunch of

105
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:29,429
animals because every time there's ever been animals, it's like they make like seven and

106
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:36,440
there's like five to seven animals in the house. And it sucks because it's like, it's like,

107
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,480
there's too many animals in the house. Just one pet. All right. Maybe we'll do one. All right.

108
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,980
First of all, I gotta remember how to play this game. I think, I don't think I want to do anything

109
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:56,659
else. I think this is perfect. I don't know why I like this. That's not me. I don't look like this.

110
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:22,740
Yeah. There's no, there's no slider mods. We're just doing straight up regular The Sims. I want

111
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:56,820
to keep the hair. I think the hair is perfect. What do you mean? I lied already. It's got to be

112
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,330
okay. I want him to, I want him to, why am I so red? That's weird. I just looked over here and saw

113
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:09,159
that. I want it to be a little weird, but I don't want it to be crazy. I don't want it to be insane

114
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:58,860
looking. Holy shit. Okay. I like it so far. Hold on. What do you think? I think that's good.

115
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:11,129
What about the shoulders? I don't know. I'm kind of torn between the wide. All right. This is,

116
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:35,769
you gave him reptilian eyes. All right. What about, those are small feet. How tall is this?

117
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:55,850
Let me look at the hair. I don't know. This looks pretty good. I think I'm all right with this one.

118
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:04,410
All right. He's going to have huge forearms and small biceps. I think that's fine. Big hands.

119
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:11,349
I need to make his hands as big as they can possibly be. How do I pick his hands?

120
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:32,859
What are the aspirations going to be? This is going to be interesting. How do I give him big

121
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:53,960
hands? You can't. Oh, okay. All right. I need, we got to do clothes. Okay. That looks good. All

122
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:06,490
right. Clothes. I really, I don't care about the clothes that much. It kind of looks like he would

123
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:28,730
be on Pee Wee's Playhouse. All right. How about just outfits? How about, oh, styled looks. Oh,

124
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:34,329
what? I made, I got the, the Star Wars shit. I could make him like a Jedi. Is that like a path

125
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:41,819
you can take? Can I get, I can, I can give this guy a lightsaber and that's not modern. I swear.

126
00:18:41,819 --> 00:19:00,519
What is this? After party. No, no, no, no. This is every day, right? Oh, wait. I don't, is this a

127
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:10,900
fanged and wild? Oh, it's a werewolf. Am I going werewolf right off the bat? I don't know if I'm

128
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:29,420
doing werewolf. These are all werewolves. Okay. Something about this is what I actually kind of

129
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:56,740
like. You made Adam Sandler. What? No, I'm going to hate this after like 15 minutes. Something else.

130
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,940
I got to finish the face. Get the, we got to get the hat off or maybe not. No, he can't just

131
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:12,460
be like a weirdo. Why is this locked? First order rank three trooper. You're going to be a storm

132
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:31,140
trooper? Is that a career path? That's all right. I'm sticking with this. So what is this? This is

133
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:46,950
party. Okay. This is for a party. Okay. All right. Summertime. You're going to keep the

134
00:20:46,950 --> 00:21:07,289
glasses. All right. This is fun. I think this is all right. Every day. I don't like them.

135
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:24,740
Please change the outfit. We can change the outfit later. All right. We need to make personality now.

136
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:35,750
All right. Aspiration, family, food, location, knowledge, nature, wellness, werewolf. Okay.

137
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,309
These Sims get an initial relationship boost when introducing themselves to werewolves.

138
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:51,670
Do I have to talk to other werewolves? They get Star Wars. Wait, what? Sims who are prepared

139
00:21:51,670 --> 00:22:02,740
voyagers fill up their needs slightly when, God, this is perfect. Hope versus order or galactic

140
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,819
privateer. This Sim isn't about choosing sides. They're happy just mingling among the smugglers

141
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:14,019
and bounty hunters on the fringe planet of Batuu. Burning a few extra credits along the way is just

142
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:21,130
a bonus no matter how they get them. Okay. On the world of Batuu, there is a growing conflict.

143
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:28,920
This Sim, there's no Star Wars shit in this, in real life. What? Is this just, I'm like a fan of

144
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:36,359
Star Wars or am I actually going to be like a lightsaber wielding attacker? You know, with the,

145
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:42,579
why can I not say the, why can I not say the fucking word? Bounty hunter. I'm just a bounty

146
00:22:42,579 --> 00:23:01,180
hunter. This is, okay. This is Jedi. Which one of these gets me a lightsaber? The left one. Okay.

147
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:04,940
Understand whether they should stand with the resistance of the first order. All right. You

148
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:14,059
got it. That's, okay. That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. All right. So what else?

149
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:21,609
Likes and dislikes. Activities. And you know what? You love bowling. You know why? Because I bought

150
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:29,289
the expansion. How do I add it? Okay. Does that mean you like it or you don't like it? Okay.

151
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:42,200
Okay. You like bowling? What else? How about rock climbing? You can choose up to 20.

152
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:52,440
Is there a lightsabers or something? I like lightsabers. What else is there? Favorite color

153
00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:07,400
is Sith. I'm a Sith Lord. Okay. Favorite music genre. Excuse me. Where's video game music?

154
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:26,059
Lullabies? Where's video game music? How about romance music? Dude, retro music. Yep. Doesn't

155
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:37,579
like pop. How about activities? Definitely comedy. Do kids radio? Wait, you can do kids radio?

156
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,869
Okay. All right. So, so far we're okay. So what about activities? You like bowling? You like

157
00:24:52,869 --> 00:25:07,619
acting? No, no, no. You like mischief? You like playing the piano? And you don't like singing?

158
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:15,829
And you don't like video games? You like writing? And you like snowboarding? And you think rocket

159
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:19,430
science is cool, but you don't like the pipe organ? And you like programming on the side?

160
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:23,269
Rock climbing is kind of fun, but you don't like it that much. You actually hate it.

161
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:39,380
Okay. What else? All right. Traits. Hot headed. Loomy. Genius. All right. What did we, what's,

162
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,309
okay. It's going to have to be something like self-assured, right? Confident. If you're going

163
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:53,670
to be a Jedi, then you have to be pretty confident. I would imagine you'd be pretty confident. Bookworm?

164
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:05,289
Geek. Oh, I just voice cracked a little. All right. So you're self-assured. You're kind of a geek.

165
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:13,430
I mean, if you're choosing as your career to be a Star Wars Jedi master, you have to be a nerd,

166
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,420
right? That's not, that's not an insult. That's just, I mean, you kind of have to be a geek,

167
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:33,299
right? How about a perfectionist? How about lazy? Make a lazy Jedi? A squee, oh, no, no, no, no, no,

168
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:41,130
no. We need like squeamish. How is he going to handle the Sith Lord? So he's going to see

169
00:26:41,130 --> 00:27:00,099
somebody get like slashed with a lightsaber and just start puking. All right. Proper cat lover.

170
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:09,509
I think this is good. I think this is good. Think of a vegetarian. I don't, I don't, I don't know

171
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:20,630
a name. What's a good name? Hello, my name is, I don't know. What's like a, what's a good name?

172
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,279
John? No, John, that's.

173
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:43,049
You just said what a Sim says in conversation. You did. That's just, that means like, hello,

174
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:58,539
Blork Snorkels. I'm going to say this out loud because I think this is a very terrible name

175
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:07,190
for a Sim, but I do enjoy the comedic effort for Jerkel Hoffman. I do appreciate the effort.

176
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:24,250
Effort is there. How about, no, I'm not going to name him Stinky Dinky. I always have such

177
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:54,900
trouble with names. I just can't do them. Bobby Tom Tatooine? No, that sucks. No, I'm not going

178
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,660
to name the guy Bobby Jerkoff. He's not going to be named Jerkoff anything. Not Bobby Jerkoff,

179
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,900
not Jerkoff Stevenson. I'm sorry. That's not this person's name. So we're going to like move on.

180
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:34,549
We're moving on. What's a Bobby, Bob, Bill, Bill Solo. That's even worse. How about, what was it,

181
00:29:34,549 --> 00:30:13,059
Blorg, Blorg's, Blorg Solo? I like Blorg Solo. How about Blorg McDonald's? This is the hardest

182
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:34,009
part. I can't do it. I hate this. Blorg Hendrix, Blorg McNulty. Do we like Blorg McNulty? That seems

183
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:46,630
actually pretty good. OK, we got Blorg McNulty. Who's next? We have to do a pet, right? We have

184
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:56,259
to make a dog. One dog, one dog, no cats, one dog. I'm not making 10 animals. It's hard to take care

185
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:08,339
of them all. It's going to be a poodle. It has to be a Star Wars looking dog. You know what I mean?

186
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:13,500
How do I make like a Star Wars character? Can I make like the legs bigger and stuff?

187
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:40,279
I need to make like a Star Wars monster. There's no body slider enhancements or anything. So

188
00:31:42,460 --> 00:32:27,640
I can't do those right now. All right. I like it so far. What about ears? Hold on.

189
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:46,410
I think it has to stay this way. It has to stay that way. Yeah. The dog's name is going to be

190
00:32:46,410 --> 00:33:18,950
Chewie. It looks like Otto. OK, I think Chewie's fine. Is that too much? Is it too weird? OK,

191
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:41,960
how do I change the coat? I think that's fine. Think of a green dog. Chewie's not green.

192
00:33:46,700 --> 00:34:21,139
This looks strange. No, this doesn't make any sense. It's Yoda. That's actually. All right.

193
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:44,869
Yeah. No, it's going to be like yodel, right? I'm not getting sued. This is yodel. You don't

194
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:55,670
need. You just yodel. Yodel. That's it. Yodel. All right. What do you like? Smart. What is this?

195
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:16,789
Oh, OK. Smart troublemaker. Aggressive. I don't want it. Hunter. Jedi. Active. Smart. And no,

196
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:25,099
not vocal. Special effects dog. Yeah, you guys can key this dog out whenever you want.

197
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:40,380
Whenever you feel like it. I think yodel. Yodel. Yodel is fine. I don't look. I want to play the

198
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,489
video game right far too many times that I've opened this game. We make a bunch of weirdos

199
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:51,460
and then they all attack each other and stab each other and shoot each other. Well, I we need to

200
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:58,329
play the Sims. You know what I mean? We need to keep these people around. And it happens within

201
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:04,230
like an hour. And then I sit around. Do you remember last time I played this when an hour

202
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:09,139
went by, they started killing each other and then I dropped two meteors on their house.

203
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:12,579
And then I was like, I don't know what to do now. Like, I can't play the game anymore. I can't play

204
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:17,699
it. There's no you don't go make macaroni and cheese after that. It's over. You don't go back

205
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:21,960
and like, yeah, I guess I'm going to queue up, go to the fridge, take a shower and take a bath.

206
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:30,840
No, no, you can't. We can't go that way. Why do you look like this? I don't know. Do the deal.

207
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,119
Yeah, we're going to do DLC. All right. This is the house. We've got the dog. We've got the guy

208
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,400
and I'm done. I'm not micromanaging 10 people. It's impossible. What the fuck did somebody

209
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:55,030
just post? Your webcam audio is late. What is happening? Are you guys for real? All right,

210
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:05,050
I'm ready. Let's take this household. We have everything we need. It's the McNulty family.

211
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:27,780
Wait, I want a different pose. How do I do a different pose? I like that one. It's off by

212
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:38,780
a split second. I don't know why that would be the case. Hold on. Oh, I do know why it's off.

213
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:48,329
It is off your. Yeah, it is because of the delay coming through. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's

214
00:37:48,329 --> 00:38:08,739
not. It's not fun. Is it? Am I? Is it one guy? OK. Oh, is it early? I thought I had a delay,

215
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:15,380
but I didn't. All right. So this is important. It's very important. I have like every expansion

216
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:21,019
I have no idea where to go or what to do. What season should this be? Spring is a great time

217
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:24,460
to plant your garden to take advantage. I don't know. We're not doing that. Temperatures are

218
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,739
climbing, so beat the heat with water balloons and sprinklers. Watch out for the thunderstorms.

219
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:35,619
All right. That's kind of cool. Gather your garden. No, no garden. When you're not bundled

220
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:41,829
up indoors, have some fun in the snow and ice. All right. Summer or fall, summer or winter.

221
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:57,619
I mean, can we get a poll in the chat? Let's get a poll. Summer or winter.

222
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:21,099
Pick one. Whoever gets more wins. You got to pick one that shouldn't have been on.

223
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:27,610
So did my mic sound fucked up because that literally should not have been turned on?

224
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:38,630
Are we good now? It actually probably sounds better now. Winter is winning by a landslide.

225
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:47,929
Oh, my God, it is. OK, yeah. Let me just double check there's not some weird setting that I turned

226
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:55,099
on. I don't think there is. No, I don't have any like filters on. I don't have any delays on.

227
00:39:56,219 --> 00:40:01,179
Everything's set to be not delayed or anything. That's so weird. I wonder why.

228
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:14,739
All right. Winter. I bought a bunch of winter packs too. I have no idea. This is so overwhelming.

229
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:22,780
I'm not going here. That's what I know. Newcrest, Magnolia, Promenade, Windenburg,

230
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:37,699
Sand, Forgotten Hollow, Del Sol Valley, Glimmer Brook, a mountain, Moonwood Mill.

231
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:46,389
Go to Forgotten Hollow. OK, this looks like a werewolf one. Go to Glimmer Brook.

232
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:49,349
The quiet town of Glimmer Brook may have more to it than meets the eye.

233
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:56,309
But do I want to do a bunch of weird shit right off the bat? This is like a map.

234
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:08,840
This place sucks. There's one place to live. What? There's one house and a bar.

235
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:20,250
Only one person gets to live here? Well, there's a magical portal. That's kind of cool.

236
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:29,820
How do I go back? What's the other one? All right. This is like a scary place.

237
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:40,550
It's like Halloween town. This place. This place. It looks weird. It's weird. Two story.

238
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:49,369
This place is it's eighteen thousand dollars. Yeah, but people can visit you from around the

239
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:56,699
world, right? Now we're starting. We're starting normal. I can move to one of these places.

240
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:09,400
Keep that in mind. What about what's this? Oh, look at this. This place is a bustling town.

241
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:19,340
How much does this place cost? Oh, look at this one. So where is this? Starlight Boulevard. Have I?

242
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,929
Sims cannot live on this residence. Didn't I do a thing where I was trying to be like a famous

243
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:42,010
person? Was that Sims 3? No, this place sucks. Boo boo boo. Go to the mountain. Let me check it out.

244
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:59,750
Oh, look at this place. It's got a ski resort. This is only two grand. This is perfect. I think

245
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:05,909
I want to do the mountain town either. OK, it's a toss up here. All right. I'm going to give you some

246
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:20,900
choices here. The mountain town. What's this? Wow. Wow. This is unbelievably beautiful here.

247
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:29,849
There's a big fountain. It's like a port. I think I think I'm making my decision. I'm going to buy

248
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:34,119
this place right on the beach. I'm doing a beach house. You can batches me all you want. That's

249
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:43,610
fine. Hold on. All right. This is kind of a city. We can visit this place, right? We can visit.

250
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:53,659
I'm doing a beach. The beach. Yeah, beach. I'm going for it. Let's go. It's time. Unfurnished.

251
00:43:53,659 --> 00:44:04,889
I'm going to build the house. Bat chest. I got we got eighteen thousand dollars. It's winter.

252
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,019
Yeah, but I'll be I'll prepare for the where's my where do I build?

253
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:18,820
Oh, this is I don't want to wait. This is where I have to build right on the water.

254
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:28,409
Wait, where's my house going to be? That's kind of I don't know. I don't know about that.

255
00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:34,099
This is it. Look at this. Look at this neighborhood. All right. We'll go for it.

256
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:37,059
We'll go for it. If I don't like it, I'll just fucking do the cheat and bulldoze it and go

257
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:45,849
somewhere else. All right. Build time. Let's go. Challenge yourself. No, thank you. This is new

258
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:58,460
music. All right. First things first. We got to do the right angle here and I want to be able to

259
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:05,860
literally just look out my window and there's the water. You know what I mean? Right here.

260
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:15,030
OK, this is a mailbox. Yep. All right. Let's do it. OK, here we go. This lot is not that big.

261
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:24,280
There's not very much space. OK, let's start with just right here.

262
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,829
I don't want to blow all my money. Hold on. Wait, don't do that. How about like this?

263
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:38,570
How do I flip? How do you flip something? Is it middle mouse? How do you flip something?

264
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:45,750
How do you flip? L? What are you doing? How would you do that? How do you flip something?

265
00:45:45,750 --> 00:46:10,780
R? No. Period. There it is. Thank you. This is going to be much bigger.

266
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:20,539
How much money do I have? I don't blow everything. All right. So this is going to be

267
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:38,300
the kitchen kind of bathroom area. Oh, shit. I'm putting it. All right. Well,

268
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:48,309
that's actually makes sense, right? How do I do the angle pitch? What's upstairs?

269
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:54,869
All right. This is fine right now. Make it a little bit bigger this way and then a little

270
00:46:54,869 --> 00:47:01,610
bit bigger this way. I only have 15 grand. Period. Now, how do I like, you know, like

271
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:16,260
go like this? All right. Now I need steps to get up here. How do I just do steps this way?

272
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:42,440
Actually, I don't hate that, though. Hold on. Comma. No, I want to pitch the camera.

273
00:47:42,440 --> 00:48:01,699
OK, now I need a door here. I need to put the walls up. A set button.

274
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:12,570
Use the Sims 3 camera is in the settings. Is it actually game camera? Oh, yeah.

275
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:16,170
Oh, yeah. Thank you so much. What a million times better thing to do.

276
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,769
That's what I was looking for. Yeah, there it is. All right. We're good.

277
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:23,639
OK, now I need to put the I need to put the walls up.

278
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:37,369
Helper Andy's. How do I put the walls up, please? It's not period. Page up and page down.

279
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:50,809
Thank you. All right. I need a door. I don't know. I don't hate that.

280
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:54,730
This is like how to get to the kitchen in a restaurant. I'm going to put that for the

281
00:48:54,730 --> 00:49:01,420
kitchen door. I do have like every expansion, so there's just a ton of random doors.

282
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,940
Wait, wait, I need a Star Wars door. First Resistance blast door.

283
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:21,340
Now, this is lame. This is too. This is lame to start with that VIP door elevator.

284
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:28,739
It has to be something interesting, but not weird, right? How about how?

285
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:33,460
OK, that look at that. That looks all right. I need it outside.

286
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:43,179
I did. OK, I need wallpaper. All right. This is for the outside of the house.

287
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:57,699
OK, no, no, no, no. Just something solid like paint siding. Here it is. No, no.

288
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:12,809
It's a beach house. There we go. That's pretty beachy.

289
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:23,059
Yeah, I'm going to have such a cool you understand my back deck and back patio

290
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:25,219
and everything is going to be so awesome. It's going to be a huge thing.

291
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:30,840
It's going to go down. All right. So now I need to do this.

292
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,300
I don't know. I don't like how this looks, though. I don't care. Page down.

293
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,699
All right. I need to start to think about this.

294
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:48,139
You're going to walk right into the kitchen. So here we go. Let's get this blocked off.

295
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:51,320
All right. So I'm thinking kitchen is going to be boink.

296
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,320
Bathroom is going to be boink. Living room is going to be boink.

297
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,880
And bedroom is going to be boink. I think that makes sense to me.

298
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,239
All right. What did you say? I think that would make sense to me.

299
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:09,849
It's a Minecraft house. Yes. All right. All right. First things first.

300
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:12,489
I need to do this in order because I always do this wrong.

301
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:25,130
I need a kitchen area. Stone is a Minecraft house. It needs to be beachy.

302
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:33,780
I'm thinking, you know, yellows, oranges, blue, light blue, light blue, yellow, right?

303
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:41,800
Let's just go with the wallpaper. Just a solid color.

304
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:54,840
How do I just do a solid color? Oh, here it is. My paint.

305
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,940
All right. Wait, this is kind of beachy. Sandy. Yep. Look at that.

306
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:10,840
Right to about here. That looks good.

307
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,500
And then let's get a little bit of blue in here like this.

308
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:19,219
Okay. Remember, it's a beach house. Why is it invisible?

309
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,659
It's not. There's no light in here.

310
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:34,070
Okay. Dude, I'm telling you right now. Guess what's going on the wall.

311
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:45,590
Can you tell me what I'm going to put in here? I'm going to put a ship wheel on the wall.

312
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:52,760
I'm going to have a ship steering wheel on the wall. All right.

313
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,780
G hides the grid. Thank you. That's actually really helpful.

314
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:03,340
Floors. Floors. Floors. Floors. Floors. It's pretty beachy.

315
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:15,340
That's pretty beachy. It kind of looks like you pulled a carpet up

316
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,900
and that's just the wood with the glue all over it. Don't matter.

317
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,739
You need windows. I'm getting there. Hold on.

318
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:25,099
I have to make. Wait, I want a huge bay window looking at the water.

319
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:46,250
Can you imagine? How big can I make this?

320
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:53,320
Now that's kind of cool. That's pretty cool.

321
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:59,739
Poster house. I don't even know what that means.

322
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:02,539
You can make big objects bigger or smaller.

323
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,460
What the? Holy shit.

324
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:12,420
Okay. Wait a minute. I didn't know you could do that.

325
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,900
Oh my goodness. All right. Well, it's not going to fit.

326
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:19,780
That's insane. All right. I think that looks fine.

327
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:25,190
Now I need. We got to do the floor in here. Remember, one of the. Wait.

328
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:28,340
Where's the bathroom? Bathroom is definitely not going to be here.

329
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:35,699
A full window. No, no, no, no, no, no. Bathroom will be here.

330
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:49,239
Section that off right now. There we go.

331
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:53,059
All right. So this is, you know, the little area to kind of hang out.

332
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:57,699
Living room, bathroom, bedroom right here.

333
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:03,619
Let's do bathroom. Let's get bathroom out of the way.

334
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:10,250
I want tile tiles. I don't like tile. I like tile.

335
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:16,090
Get over it. Hmm. Beachy though.

336
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:17,610
This look. I like that. No, I don't.

337
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:30,820
It's like a public bathroom. Oh, no, that's cool.

338
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:35,769
Yeah. Now we need wallpaper for the bathroom.

339
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:40,780
What are you guys thinking? How come this Halloween music?

340
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,900
I don't know why this. Yeah.

341
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,320
It's just whatever the Sims music is cycling through right now.

342
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:56,889
Hmm. Should we tile on the wall? How about masonry?

343
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:59,449
Ooh. Yeah. It is like scary music.

344
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:06,119
It's because of the werewolf expansion turned on.

345
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:10,980
I think it's because the werewolf expansion is currently active.

346
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:21,539
I don't mind this. Look at that. That looks kind of cool.

347
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:25,610
Kind of. No. It's a solid color for now.

348
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:35,619
How about like something light? Light.

349
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:40,280
Yeah. Who cares? It doesn't matter.

350
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,119
All right. So that's the bathroom. This is the what should I do for this?

351
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:50,980
Fucking cop it. Oh, I want to tell you something.

352
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:58,360
So Holly and I were laughing on the couch the other day because she told me

353
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:01,239
that I have a catchphrase that I do.

354
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:03,800
I she's like, you say this all the time.

355
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,010
I was like, what are you talking about?

356
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:09,110
She's telling me that, hey, you know, you say that a lot.

357
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,429
I'm like, say what? Apparently I don't.

358
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:14,389
I have a catchphrase between me and my girlfriend that I don't even realize I have it.

359
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:19,860
And apparently I say like, oh, fucking like, garlic, garlic, kid.

360
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,219
Oh, yeah. Give me some fucking garlic, dude.

361
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,110
For no reason, apparently. And I'm like, no, there has to be a reason

362
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,030
of why I'm saying like, oh, fucking garlic.

363
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:31,989
I just do like a Boston accent joke and I say garlic.

364
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:34,469
But I don't I don't know why I'm saying it.

365
00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:37,670
And I'm like, well, no, it's something that garlic is on screen.

366
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:41,429
You know, somebody mentions garlic. She's like, no, no, you just be sitting around.

367
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:43,590
You just look over to me and go like, oh, fucking garlic, kid.

368
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:47,619
I'm like, there's no way I do that. It's impossible.

369
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:54,010
But apparently I have a catchphrase that I did not know I had until literally two days ago.

370
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,250
Fucking garlic, dude. I don't know why.

371
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:00,090
And I'm like, why would I say that? She's like, I don't know.

372
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:06,139
You just do. And now that I think about it, I kind of like I kind of do that.

373
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,719
Oh, fucking garlic, dude. I don't know why.

374
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,949
No, no, not floor tiles. I actually I don't like wooden floors.

375
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:26,650
They're so noisy and it's so I hate them.

376
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:31,210
I know that's the modern thing to do right now is, oh, man, wood floors wouldn't mean authentic wood.

377
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:34,940
When you step on a wood floor, it goes like this.

378
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:43,500
Every single time you put your feet down and sometimes randomly,

379
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:48,409
randomly, you'll be lying in bed and you will hear this at four o'clock in the morning.

380
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:54,969
And go, what was that?

381
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:58,570
That just makes they just loud. It makes sounds that they could expand. I don't I hate them.

382
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:10,500
It's called slippers. It's noisy.

383
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,550
It's noisy and it sound bounces off of it.

384
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,590
I like fucking carpets, dude, just like I like garlic.

385
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:23,179
How do I turn the camera off? I forgot I redid this whole setup so I can't escape.

386
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:25,260
I have to sit here and live with what I just did.

387
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:31,900
Yeah, carpets are gross if you don't take care of them.

388
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:36,519
All you guys saying carpets smell like puke and stuff.

389
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:39,960
Are you wearing your shoes in those rooms?

390
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,800
Take your shoes off before you get on the carpet and vacuum it every so often.

391
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:50,340
For God sakes, if you spill an entire two liter of coke on the ground,

392
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,380
you're going to need to clean it.

393
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,099
You're going to need to get in there and clean up the carpet.

394
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:57,179
You don't just move something of rug over it.

395
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:02,039
Nah, dude, nah, you're fucked up. Every carpet smells like puke.

396
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,599
Did you puke on it and didn't clean it?

397
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:07,880
It's called vacuuming. It's called cleaning.

398
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,900
And it's called don't not wearing your shoes in the room where the carpets are.

399
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:20,309
OK, let's do carpet.

400
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:23,059
What's with all these patterns here?

401
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:24,739
Wait, why? What's with these patterns?

402
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:27,849
Oh, there it is. OK.

403
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:29,929
And I'm just going to go. We're just going to go standard.

404
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:33,670
Yeah. OK, let's get some objects.

405
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:42,900
13 grand through the kitchen.

406
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,579
Why is it getting weirder?

407
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,659
Music seems all right. I don't want to do anything too crazy.

408
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,429
You want to spend money on the cookware, though.

409
01:00:51,429 --> 01:00:53,030
Right. So you don't burn the house down.

410
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,030
Oh, I need windows.

411
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:03,030
Short classic casement.

412
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:09,559
That's fine. Right.

413
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:13,449
It's classic windows.

414
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:15,289
I don't think I need a window in this room.

415
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:17,510
This whole room is a window.

416
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:29,340
Maybe one or two here.

417
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:35,619
OK, you should use Linux.

418
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:44,440
All right. This whole room is a window.

419
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,849
No, I'm not putting any more windows in here.

420
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:48,889
There you go. There's your window.

421
01:01:48,889 --> 01:01:51,190
And we'll do a bathroom window.

422
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:54,099
Like, no, no bathroom.

423
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:57,619
All right. Here we go. Kitchen stuff.

424
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:59,139
We got the fridge. We need a stove.

425
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:01,289
I need counters, too.

426
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:04,489
Remember, the theme is beach.

427
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:08,360
I think that's a that's a decent color, too.

428
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,230
Do two counters.

429
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,539
Stove is when you sink.

430
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:16,070
So let's do stove.

431
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,949
I don't want to lose all my money, but this is how you burn a house down.

432
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:22,980
So I'm thinking of going with London's choice.

433
01:02:23,059 --> 01:02:31,260
Ooh, this is a London's choice.

434
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,500
Food quality seven, power consumption, reliability.

435
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,179
It's been plus cooking skill.

436
01:02:35,179 --> 01:02:36,699
You need lights in here. I will.

437
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:41,769
It's the best place to get light.

438
01:02:41,769 --> 01:02:47,909
How do I get lights?

439
01:02:47,909 --> 01:02:52,550
It's lighting its own thing.

440
01:02:52,550 --> 01:03:00,949
Objects by function lighting.

441
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:03,860
OK. Oh, this. Look at that.

442
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:11,059
All right. So let's do wall lights.

443
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:13,380
I'm a big fan of just basic lighting.

444
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,500
I don't like chandeliers.

445
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,820
I feel like they're going to drop on me and crush me like a cartoon.

446
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:20,280
I don't like them. They freak me out.

447
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,559
I don't like anything hanging.

448
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:22,760
I don't like ceiling fans.

449
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,219
Ceiling fans, they they scare me.

450
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:30,889
I feel like they're going to fall and just chop me up.

451
01:03:30,889 --> 01:03:33,369
Anytime I've ever had a place where it's like, oh, there's a ceiling fan

452
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:35,210
literally right above the fucking bed.

453
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,789
It's just like, I don't want to turn that on.

454
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,940
Oh, let's turn it on high.

455
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,889
This is a helicopter blade that's about to drop.

456
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,219
I don't like them.

457
01:03:45,219 --> 01:03:50,019
They think they kind of freak me out, even if they're installed properly.

458
01:03:50,019 --> 01:03:51,699
I don't know. It's weird to me.

459
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:55,190
I'll just try to get a fan in the corner.

460
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:56,869
It just kind of right.

461
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:59,619
You like ceiling fans. It's up to you, but I don't like shit.

462
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:06,090
I don't like any hanging objects.

463
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:07,449
There we go. This is perfect.

464
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:12,710
Should we do ceiling lights or should we do on the wall?

465
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:15,000
These are probably the best, right?

466
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,300
Just do like two, three cans.

467
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:26,090
Wall lights are probably. You want to see wall lights?

468
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:32,300
No, I'm not doing fluorescent lights.

469
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,300
Oh, look at that. That's cute.

470
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,820
We'll do two of these.

471
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,920
Where are lights usually in houses?

472
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,489
You would like to stop and think.

473
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:42,570
Don't look in your room and don't look in your house.

474
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:43,449
What is it? Like, where does he?

475
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:47,989
What are your little lights on your walls besides the ceiling?

476
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:49,909
Right. Forget about the ceiling.

477
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:51,909
If you have like a like a wall, a wall light.

478
01:04:51,909 --> 01:04:56,280
Like, where is it? Where does it go up on the ceiling?

479
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,400
Yeah, but you know what I'm saying?

480
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,530
You know what I'm saying about that?

481
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:02,659
Like above the door, right?

482
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:05,139
With a shelf in corners.

483
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:09,429
Yeah, I'm going to go like this.

484
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:11,190
We're going to do a cute shelf here, too.

485
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,949
Is this painted?

486
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:24,500
Look at how charming that is.

487
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,139
There's 30,000 people here.

488
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:30,699
What the? There are 30. What are you doing here?

489
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:32,219
Why are there so many people here?

490
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:38,139
What's going on? Why are there so many people here?

491
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:40,380
What the fuck? These are Minecraft torches.

492
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,179
That's fine.

493
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:44,760
Anyways, hi. How are you doing?

494
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,179
It's the Among Us waiting room.

495
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:48,139
Holy shit.

496
01:05:48,139 --> 01:05:50,420
Oh, welcome everybody. Hi.

497
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,840
All right. So that's good.

498
01:05:52,840 --> 01:06:01,320
I need to sink every time I buy.

499
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,360
No, don't do this, right?

500
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,360
Everyone just goes to the top left section

501
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,960
as buys the top left sink.

502
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,119
Don't in the Sims. They break every five minutes.

503
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:10,090
It just water just shoots out of them.

504
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:15,539
Bring up some extra cash here and buy a good one.

505
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:16,659
Yeah, like this one. This one.

506
01:06:16,659 --> 01:06:18,900
What? This one here is like a hundred and twenty five.

507
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,219
No, no, no. You got to get plenty up here.

508
01:06:21,219 --> 01:06:24,119
Yeah, like this one.

509
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:29,190
See, this one's nice and modern.

510
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:37,130
Could you please say the McGriddle in the scorn voice?

511
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:42,679
I understand that you're in your editing program.

512
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:43,880
You're in like Premiere

513
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,679
and you're hovering over this section of the video you're editing

514
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:48,760
where you're like, fuck, I really have to get them to say this.

515
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,820
It's like the last thing you have to implant in the timeline.

516
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,570
But I mean, I'm sorry.

517
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:56,809
We just you're going to have to you're going to have to wing it.

518
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,679
You're going to have to wing it.

519
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:02,219
All right, that's good.

520
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:04,380
Now I need a toaster oven.

521
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:10,809
Should I do one more counter?

522
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:11,929
Yeah, just in case.

523
01:07:11,929 --> 01:07:13,769
What about a dishwasher?

524
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:16,280
No, they don't. They don't use it.

525
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,880
Put trash over here.

526
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,760
But you people need to be able to come in the fucking house.

527
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,119
Oh, my God. I'm so dumb.

528
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:23,480
It can't be anything here.

529
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,880
How about like this way?

530
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:38,619
I think that's good.

531
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:39,420
Yeah, that looks fine.

532
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,219
And then put like, you know, a coffee maker, a toaster oven,

533
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:43,579
all the appliances.

534
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:44,460
Let's see what we got.

535
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:53,860
Should I just install a subway into that?

536
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,059
I feel like this would be awesome.

537
01:07:55,059 --> 01:08:00,940
Can you imagine if you just woke up in the morning

538
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,539
and went into your kitchen

539
01:08:02,539 --> 01:08:06,840
and it was just like a subway station?

540
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,440
Somebody has to maintain this, though.

541
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:20,710
Can I actually make food with this?

542
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:26,039
If I remove everything here except the sink?

543
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:27,880
Is this can I make food here?

544
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:38,180
It's a beach house.

545
01:08:38,180 --> 01:09:03,029
It's like a vacation house.

546
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:04,069
That's all right.

547
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:09,800
I think that looks that's all right.

548
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,760
Put a trash can right here.

549
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,479
Got it. All right.

550
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:20,699
Now we need a microwave and a coffee maker.

551
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:26,579
This one seems fine, but it's coming together.

552
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,100
Now I need a trash can.

553
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,340
Just a little bin right here.

554
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:35,239
Is it too big?

555
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:37,130
What about a little one?

556
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,600
This one?

557
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,840
Come on.

558
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,399
Really?

559
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:52,579
I don't like this weird space here.

560
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:57,050
I hate this so much and I can't I can't fix it.

561
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,010
That's okay.

562
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:03,159
I don't just I don't despise that.

563
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:06,340
And then we put a little table here.

564
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,539
Move the door one over.

565
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:26,100
That person is smart.

566
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,220
Well, I didn't want to do that.

567
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,899
Actually, that's kind of better.

568
01:10:28,899 --> 01:10:42,569
I want to pick this up and move it.

569
01:10:42,569 --> 01:10:47,350
Hold alt.

570
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:48,149
Oh my God.

571
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:51,239
Wait, I could just hold the mouse button down.

572
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:51,800
All right.

573
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,340
So that I can put this here then.

574
01:10:55,340 --> 01:11:05,880
That's definitely better right in the corner.

575
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,539
Door will be moved.

576
01:11:08,539 --> 01:11:10,659
I can get it to move.

577
01:11:10,659 --> 01:11:11,529
All right.

578
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:12,729
I got to go into build mode, right?

579
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:13,609
I am in build mode.

580
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:16,340
How do I get this to move out of here?

581
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,640
Oh, there we go.

582
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,119
Okay.

583
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:23,300
And now I want to extend this out this way.

584
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:29,130
Can I not extend this out?

585
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:33,079
Oh, that's better.

586
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:33,399
All right.

587
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:37,909
Now this moves here and the door goes right there.

588
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:38,619
Perfect.

589
01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:39,020
Okay.

590
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:45,960
Good.

591
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,020
And then just have a bathroom door.

592
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:55,939
Oh, God damn it.

593
01:11:55,939 --> 01:11:58,329
I got to delete this thing.

594
01:11:58,329 --> 01:12:06,279
Do I have a big barn door?

595
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:12,229
Hey, no, we're going all night.

596
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:13,029
So don't worry.

597
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,840
This stream is not going to be over in like an hour.

598
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,399
Don't worry.

599
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:20,300
I'm down to play this.

600
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:20,939
I'm here.

601
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:28,359
I got a nice clean room.

602
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:30,119
BB move objects on.

603
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:31,750
For the love of God.

604
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,859
Wait, what happened?

605
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:34,939
BB dot move objects on.

606
01:12:34,939 --> 01:12:35,899
It's being spammed.

607
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:36,939
What does that mean?

608
01:12:36,939 --> 01:12:39,609
What does BB dot move objects on?

609
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:50,970
Control shift C.

610
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:51,850
BB.

611
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,560
What am I doing?

612
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:59,619
BB dot move object.

613
01:12:59,619 --> 01:13:02,600
What does this do?

614
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:11,539
Move objects cheat is on.

615
01:13:11,539 --> 01:13:15,479
What does it do?

616
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:19,590
Did you just fuck up my achievements?

617
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:21,340
You can place objects anywhere.

618
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:22,779
Did you just fuck up my achievements?

619
01:13:22,779 --> 01:13:26,300
I can't get Xbox achievements now.

620
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,010
Thanks.

621
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:28,250
Okay.

622
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,050
Let's get back to this.

623
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:35,460
Kitchen looks good.

624
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,569
Now we're almost ready to get started.

625
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:43,510
Remember, you're making the shittiest house I've ever seen in Sims 4.

626
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:46,390
That is a complete fucking lie.

627
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:49,909
Considering you've watched other streams of me play this game.

628
01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:51,270
And they were way worse.

629
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:52,550
There were no windows.

630
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:53,590
It was one floor.

631
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:55,739
You've seen it before.

632
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,510
You saw it like a year ago.

633
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:58,630
You've already seen me play this.

634
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,750
This is a major marketed improvement from what I was doing before.

635
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:05,539
It's still one floor.

636
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:07,029
Oh, yeah?

637
01:14:07,029 --> 01:14:09,699
Wait till you see what I've learned so far.

638
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:09,939
All right.

639
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:10,500
Let's go.

640
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,720
What about other little things here?

641
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:22,140
Fire prevention system utility?

642
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,819
Gotta have like a plant.

643
01:14:23,819 --> 01:14:31,060
I don't know, a bowl of fruit or whatever that is.

644
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,020
Who cares?

645
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:36,949
All right.

646
01:14:36,949 --> 01:14:37,989
Ooh, what's this?

647
01:14:37,989 --> 01:14:39,979
A basketball.

648
01:14:50,539 --> 01:14:51,979
Where's the thing that I want?

649
01:14:51,979 --> 01:14:53,020
The ship wheel.

650
01:14:53,020 --> 01:15:03,350
What is this?

651
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:10,970
No, wheel.

652
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:11,529
What?

653
01:15:11,529 --> 01:15:18,229
I have to be level four actor to buy a ship pirate wheel?

654
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:36,600
I'm putting this right over the bed.

655
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:49,779
Cheat?

656
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:52,090
No, I'm not cheating.

657
01:15:52,090 --> 01:16:16,840
I'm playing this legit.

658
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,399
Now I need bathroom stuff.

659
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:20,939
I need a light in the bathroom too.

660
01:16:20,939 --> 01:16:27,659
I forgot.

661
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:32,949
Oh, there it is.

662
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:34,069
What the fuck is that?

663
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:34,390
All right.

664
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,510
No, no, we're not doing that.

665
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:38,649
We'll do these.

666
01:16:38,649 --> 01:16:39,689
These are kind of fine.

667
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:52,699
That's better.

668
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:55,130
Then put a mirror right there.

669
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:58,300
And then, I don't know, have something else.

670
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:03,399
I need to be an actor level four.

671
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:05,449
That shouldn't take too long, right?

672
01:17:05,449 --> 01:17:13,050
All right.

673
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:13,850
There's enough light in here.

674
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:14,250
I don't care.

675
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:24,180
Now I need toilet, bathroom, toilet.

676
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:24,420
All right.

677
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:24,739
There.

678
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:28,069
So public bathroom.

679
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,210
I want a public bathroom.

680
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:31,689
Can I do that?

681
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:32,489
How much is this?

682
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:35,239
This is $2,700.

683
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:41,529
You have a public bathroom.

684
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:43,289
If you need to go to the bathroom, you go outside

685
01:17:43,289 --> 01:17:44,649
into the public bathroom.

686
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:45,130
That's fine.

687
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,260
I don't care.

688
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:51,579
I don't care about wasted money.

689
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:53,260
Dude, why would I even make a bathroom?

690
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,579
Just put a shower in the corner or something.

691
01:17:55,579 --> 01:18:04,600
Who's going to clean this?

692
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,060
I don't- me?

693
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:14,039
Should I even have a toilet?

694
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:18,569
I don't think I'd buy a toilet if there's a-

695
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:20,569
just like a full public bathroom over here.

696
01:18:20,569 --> 01:18:29,369
I'm going to hold off for now, but I'll get a shower.

697
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:32,260
Wait, hold on.

698
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:36,180
No, I can't have- what?

699
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:37,460
Why- what is this?

700
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,619
This is no shower?

701
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:44,380
You just spray yourself with water in the corner?

702
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,819
I'm very curious.

703
01:18:45,819 --> 01:18:47,579
How does this work?

704
01:18:52,869 --> 01:18:54,310
I need- I need it for now.

705
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:57,739
And then we have like a bathtub running out of money.

706
01:18:57,739 --> 01:19:09,800
I only have $2,800.

707
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,039
All right.

708
01:19:10,039 --> 01:19:11,479
I got to get more essentials.

709
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:11,800
Shower?

710
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,680
I need a sink.

711
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,119
Need a mirror.

712
01:19:16,789 --> 01:19:17,670
This one's fine.

713
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,789
Just like a little medicine cabinet.

714
01:19:18,789 --> 01:19:19,350
That's fine.

715
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:28,550
I need the walls up.

716
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:30,220
Oh, not that much.

717
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:34,199
I want to put this on the other wall.

718
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:36,329
Oh, fuck it.

719
01:19:36,329 --> 01:19:36,890
Who cares?

720
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:47,670
How do I make this?

721
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:49,029
How do I make this lower?

722
01:19:49,029 --> 01:19:56,090
Oh, there we go.

723
01:19:56,090 --> 01:20:06,819
Does this have to be this tall?

724
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:09,539
Okay.

725
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:10,340
Well, whatever.

726
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:16,069
All right. Bathroom's good.

727
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:18,630
Oh, I need a door.

728
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:21,210
I'll figure- I'll figure that out in a minute.

729
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,300
All right.

730
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,659
This is the living room slash bedroom slash hangout zone.

731
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:28,630
First of all, let's get something out of the way here.

732
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:29,750
Let's get a nice rug.

733
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:34,119
I like the frog one.

734
01:20:34,119 --> 01:20:36,390
That's pretty cool.

735
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:49,560
That's pretty cool.

736
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:55,050
All right.

737
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,340
Don't run out of money.

738
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,100
Why is only half of this house-

739
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,699
What is going on here?

740
01:21:01,699 --> 01:21:03,380
Why did it not paint the whole thing?

741
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:03,779
This-

742
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:04,100
All right.

743
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:04,659
Wait a minute.

744
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:09,340
Something's wrong here.

745
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,619
Oh, it's panels.

746
01:21:10,619 --> 01:21:12,060
Where is it?

747
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,810
No, it's siding.

748
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:17,770
It's siding.

749
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:26,739
Can I not do that?

750
01:21:26,739 --> 01:21:29,340
Oh, it just looks so weird.

751
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:29,659
Okay.

752
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:30,539
That was weird.

753
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:31,859
Doesn't it look like the same thing?

754
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:32,500
Is it the sunlight?

755
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,770
All right.

756
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:34,409
I need a roof.

757
01:21:34,409 --> 01:21:36,090
Everyone will yell at me if I don't make one.

758
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:39,050
What kind of roof?

759
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:53,510
Does this cost money?

760
01:21:53,510 --> 01:22:11,479
Make it so it only-

761
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:25,050
You bet your ass.

762
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:27,369
I put a fucking shitload of solar panels on this thing.

763
01:22:27,369 --> 01:22:32,260
Just make sure-

764
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,779
Aim it directly to the sun.

765
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:36,550
Are there solar panels?

766
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,760
What if I'm going to flip it?

767
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,680
Actually, it wouldn't look so weird if it was flipped.

768
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,859
And then shrink it.

769
01:22:55,859 --> 01:23:17,579
They were building two different houses when they got here.

770
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:17,819
All right.

771
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:18,220
No, no, no.

772
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:18,939
This is wrong.

773
01:23:18,939 --> 01:23:20,119
Let's get rid of this.

774
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:31,340
I want it to look cool,

775
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:45,529
but I don't want it to be stupid looking.

776
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:46,170
Oh my.

777
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:52,500
Whatever.

778
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,300
That's not bad.

779
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:58,500
It just needs to be smaller.

780
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:06,279
Is it going into the house?

781
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:06,600
Wait.

782
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,199
The roof is going into the house.

783
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:13,319
This is wrong.

784
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:18,149
My god.

785
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:18,470
Whatever.

786
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,069
Just do a fucking regular ass roof.

787
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:20,789
Who cares?

788
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:37,899
Dude, no one even sees this.

789
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:40,710
No one even sees this.

790
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:41,750
It's never shown.

791
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:44,869
It just has to exist.

792
01:24:44,869 --> 01:24:46,069
So who cares?

793
01:24:46,069 --> 01:24:47,029
It's never shown.

794
01:24:47,029 --> 01:24:48,229
It just needs to exist.

795
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:53,479
That doesn't matter.

796
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:54,199
It exists.

797
01:24:54,199 --> 01:24:57,659
That's the only thing that matters.

798
01:24:57,659 --> 01:24:58,859
If it exists.

799
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:01,260
I just heard my girlfriend laugh at me.

800
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:02,140
I heard her laugh.

801
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,100
I heard her.

802
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:03,739
I could hear it.

803
01:25:04,659 --> 01:25:05,140
I heard it.

804
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,550
The movement sheets are fucking everything up.

805
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:17,350
I told you I didn't want my Xbox achievements to be messed up.

806
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:22,550
It's fine.

807
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:22,789
All right.

808
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:23,909
I just need to paint the outside.

809
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:31,590
Siding.

810
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:32,069
Look it.

811
01:25:32,069 --> 01:25:32,869
It's fine.

812
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:34,819
It's fine.

813
01:25:36,789 --> 01:25:37,590
It was an addition.

814
01:25:38,229 --> 01:25:39,350
Place things better.

815
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:41,029
A lot of architect.

816
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:44,979
Okay.

817
01:25:44,979 --> 01:25:45,859
So let's get in here.

818
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,880
Page down.

819
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,199
No.

820
01:25:48,199 --> 01:25:49,239
Excuse me.

821
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:50,899
Excuse me.

822
01:25:50,899 --> 01:25:51,880
There we go.

823
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,359
All right.

824
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:53,880
So now I got bathroom set.

825
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,920
I just need to do just a little bit of entertainment and a bed and I'm done.

826
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,550
We can add to it later.

827
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,239
I just want a huge bed.

828
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,750
Can I make this like a quad?

829
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:12,329
Okay.

830
01:26:12,329 --> 01:26:14,810
I kind of want the gigantic fucking bed.

831
01:26:16,649 --> 01:26:18,649
How does somebody sleep in this thing?

832
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:21,590
Do they actually get in here and sleep in it?

833
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:27,159
I don't.

834
01:26:27,159 --> 01:26:27,880
How?

835
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:32,890
That's a man-sized bed.

836
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:37,800
What happened to the stairs?

837
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:42,819
Excuse me.

838
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:45,590
Why did that happen?

839
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:50,119
There's no explanation for why that happened.

840
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:53,899
That's a man-sized bed.

841
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,300
All right.

842
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,340
I'm almost ready to start.

843
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,180
Any of the necessities that I need.

844
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,220
Maybe a TV, right?

845
01:27:01,779 --> 01:27:02,500
Television.

846
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,460
Just a TV to have.

847
01:27:10,619 --> 01:27:11,180
Just to have it.

848
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:11,340
All right.

849
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:12,539
I have 300 bucks.

850
01:27:12,539 --> 01:27:13,100
It's time to go.

851
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:13,579
Let's play.

852
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:15,579
Bingo.

853
01:27:15,579 --> 01:27:16,979
Start the game.

854
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:18,739
Here we are.

855
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:22,939
How are we going?

856
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:23,739
Hold on.

857
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,180
I got to turn it up a little.

858
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,890
It's a little low.

859
01:27:27,449 --> 01:27:31,369
Oh my god.

860
01:27:31,369 --> 01:27:35,609
I have to save this.

861
01:27:35,609 --> 01:27:36,090
All right.

862
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,130
So what's this guy's name?

863
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,460
Lord McNulty.

864
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,300
Where am I going?

865
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,579
Chat with Jace.

866
01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:46,539
What do I need?

867
01:27:46,539 --> 01:27:47,500
Where are my needs?

868
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:52,090
Where am I going?

869
01:27:57,029 --> 01:27:58,149
He's going to shoot me with a cannon.

870
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:02,859
So my house is right next to like a playground?

871
01:28:02,859 --> 01:28:06,539
I've been to the Flaxfire Outpost on Batu.

872
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:08,380
I missed the text.

873
01:28:09,829 --> 01:28:11,109
When you're ready to head to Batu,

874
01:28:11,109 --> 01:28:13,270
click on your phone and select take a vacation.

875
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,229
And select Batu.

876
01:28:18,779 --> 01:28:19,340
All right.

877
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:20,300
What do you want to do?

878
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,750
Play video games and listen to kids music.

879
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,550
Oh, well, this is...

880
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:39,979
Leave there, please.

881
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:41,260
Listen to kids music.

882
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:43,909
Wait, can I play on this stuff?

883
01:28:43,909 --> 01:28:45,289
No, you can't.

884
01:28:45,289 --> 01:28:46,489
Wait, I can.

885
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:47,289
I'm not doing that.

886
01:28:49,829 --> 01:28:51,770
Fuck out of here.

887
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:52,329
I'm going up.

888
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:56,199
Why does he want to listen to kids music?

889
01:28:59,100 --> 01:28:59,819
I should have waited.

890
01:28:59,819 --> 01:29:01,899
Listen to kids music be one of his aspirations.

891
01:29:01,899 --> 01:29:06,819
There's no bathroom door.

892
01:29:07,619 --> 01:29:09,819
I got it.

893
01:29:09,819 --> 01:29:15,640
He's got a bathroom.

894
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,439
He's got an old public bathroom down there.

895
01:29:18,439 --> 01:29:22,439
All right.

896
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:23,159
You're good.

897
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:24,140
Let's go.

898
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,720
All right.

899
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:26,920
So first things first.

900
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,840
Where's the dog?

901
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:29,079
All right.

902
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:29,960
What are you up to?

903
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:35,210
You doing all right?

904
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,970
Give a $10 treat.

905
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:40,329
Can you not?

906
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:41,689
Oh, that's right.

907
01:29:41,689 --> 01:29:44,439
I don't have the mod that means you can play as the pet.

908
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:44,760
Okay.

909
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,979
So let's go talk.

910
01:29:47,979 --> 01:29:49,180
Let's go get to know the dog.

911
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,470
I think that's a good idea.

912
01:29:50,470 --> 01:30:05,319
All right.

913
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:07,800
So I do want to go do the Star Wars thing because that's an aspiration.

914
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,439
Actually, I need to get a job first.

915
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:15,670
Do you actually use the public bathroom?

916
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:19,880
How do I make it go fast without having to click down here?

917
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,600
Is there a certain button combination?

918
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:31,460
Of all the expansions laughing my ass off, you're going to play Batuu.

919
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:37,880
Is that something wrong with that?

920
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:43,579
Friend.

921
01:30:43,579 --> 01:30:43,899
Friendly.

922
01:30:43,899 --> 01:30:44,380
Okay.

923
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,260
Who are you?

924
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:49,720
This is Hillary Lawrence.

925
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,359
Neighbor.

926
01:30:50,359 --> 01:30:53,770
Should we talk about Star Wars?

927
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:59,800
I need to play video games.

928
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,600
Do you have any video games?

929
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,060
I hear a DS on you.

930
01:31:10,329 --> 01:31:11,210
Is it really that bad?

931
01:31:12,409 --> 01:31:13,050
Move the cam.

932
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,819
Oh, it's covering the needs.

933
01:31:15,819 --> 01:31:16,300
You're it.

934
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:16,779
Yeah.

935
01:31:16,779 --> 01:31:18,390
Should I put it up here?

936
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,779
I'm going to flip it horizontally.

937
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:21,899
People are going to freak out.

938
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:29,369
People are going to lose their minds right now.

939
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:33,239
No, no, no.

940
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:34,199
Top right.

941
01:31:34,199 --> 01:31:39,640
Top right has info on it, though.

942
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,340
There's no information on the top left.

943
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:42,390
This is fine.

944
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:43,510
I'm just going to be flipped.

945
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:46,890
Oh, what'd you bring?

946
01:31:48,899 --> 01:31:50,180
Gourmet fruitcake.

947
01:31:51,779 --> 01:31:53,859
Why is everybody showing up right now?

948
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:56,279
You don't have to knock on the door.

949
01:31:56,279 --> 01:31:56,840
We're standing.

950
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:57,720
Welcome to the neighborhood.

951
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,279
How do I eat that?

952
01:31:59,350 --> 01:31:59,670
All right.

953
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:00,550
Invite everybody in.

954
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:01,029
Come on in.

955
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:03,100
Have you seen my dog, Yodel?

956
01:32:06,539 --> 01:32:07,180
Everybody come on in.

957
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,380
This is a hazard.

958
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:15,140
Somebody could literally fall and break their ankle.

959
01:32:15,939 --> 01:32:16,899
Please get in.

960
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:17,619
This is a hazard.

961
01:32:17,619 --> 01:32:18,659
There's no handrails.

962
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:20,659
Someone's going to fall down and get hurt.

963
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:23,960
All right.

964
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:24,760
Say hello.

965
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:25,239
Come on in.

966
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:29,319
Where'd that fruitcake go?

967
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,470
Where's the fruitcake?

968
01:32:35,909 --> 01:32:37,670
I don't have a fruitcake in my inventory.

969
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:42,119
Give it to me.

970
01:32:42,119 --> 01:32:42,600
Where is it?

971
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:46,600
Pet obsessions.

972
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,560
Like almost all pets,

973
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,479
Yodel can get inexplicably obsessed

974
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:50,520
about things around the house.

975
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,880
Keep an eye on your furry companion.

976
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,760
What are you obsessed with?

977
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,399
A fridge?

978
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,279
Oh, there it is.

979
01:32:57,399 --> 01:32:57,960
I'm going to put this up.

980
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,000
Yeah, I'm going to eat this later.

981
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,079
Why is he obsessed with the fridge?

982
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,579
Okay.

983
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:06,699
So I can eat that later.

984
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,779
Anybody know how to welcome wagon?

985
01:33:10,779 --> 01:33:11,819
Oh, that's what it is.

986
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:18,100
Should I hire staff?

987
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,699
I'm going to serve brunch.

988
01:33:20,819 --> 01:33:21,460
Eggs and toast.

989
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,180
How does this work?

990
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,699
Is it actually like a subway station?

991
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:30,180
This is actually dangerous.

992
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:31,939
Chorg.

993
01:33:32,579 --> 01:33:33,300
Wixana.

994
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:34,020
Sarpah.

995
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:34,739
Yabba too.

996
01:33:35,539 --> 01:33:36,340
Wanjini.

997
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:36,979
What am I making?

998
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,460
Holy shit, dude.

999
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:41,939
Relax.

1000
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:50,420
Where's the herbs and cheese bread, man?

1001
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:50,899
Come on.

1002
01:33:51,779 --> 01:33:53,300
Where's the Italians herbs and cheese?

1003
01:34:02,199 --> 01:34:03,399
Yodel is an active dog.

1004
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:04,680
They will frequently run around.

1005
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:06,229
Where'd you go?

1006
01:34:06,869 --> 01:34:08,329
Stay out of there.

1007
01:34:09,779 --> 01:34:10,340
Wait.

1008
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:10,899
No, no, no, no, no.

1009
01:34:10,899 --> 01:34:12,020
I thought I was controlling the dog.

1010
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:18,520
Wait.

1011
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,479
Oh, I have a cooking skill.

1012
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:22,039
You don't like dogs.

1013
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,000
This shit is a fucking bad hole.

1014
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,800
Wait, did I save it?

1015
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:56,590
No.

1016
01:34:57,689 --> 01:34:58,729
Somebody help.

1017
01:34:58,729 --> 01:35:00,250
What are you standing there for?

1018
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,689
You psychos.

1019
01:35:01,689 --> 01:35:03,050
Somebody help me.

1020
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:04,010
I'm the new neighbor.

1021
01:35:04,569 --> 01:35:05,689
I'm the new neighbor.

1022
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,159
What do I do?

1023
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:12,920
Put yourself out.

1024
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:13,420
Quick.

1025
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:28,569
Am I alive?

1026
01:35:30,869 --> 01:35:31,270
Okay.

1027
01:35:31,829 --> 01:35:32,470
What happened?

1028
01:35:33,109 --> 01:35:37,020
Holy fucking moly.

1029
01:35:38,229 --> 01:35:39,109
I just got money.

1030
01:35:39,109 --> 01:35:39,909
Who is this guy?

1031
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:45,800
Did I fuck up my entire house already?

1032
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:49,899
Would he just take out green sludge out of this?

1033
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,369
Why did you just empty a whole can of peas?

1034
01:35:53,369 --> 01:35:53,930
Who are you?

1035
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:54,810
Why are you in my house?

1036
01:35:58,579 --> 01:36:00,180
I'm venting about this.

1037
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:03,300
Why would you eat?

1038
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,500
What is the peas for?

1039
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,779
You brought peas?

1040
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:11,289
You're a lunatic.

1041
01:36:11,289 --> 01:36:14,619
If you bring a bowl of peas to somebody's house.

1042
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:15,819
Just unprompted.

1043
01:36:15,819 --> 01:36:16,380
Oh, yeah.

1044
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,180
Welcome to the neighborhood.

1045
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,699
I dumped a can of peas in here.

1046
01:36:21,739 --> 01:36:22,779
Can I clean up?

1047
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,899
Who's screaming?

1048
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:31,100
Do you hear that?

1049
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,239
Oh, you turned the TV on.

1050
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:39,479
Okay.

1051
01:36:41,909 --> 01:36:44,380
Well, this is obviously destroyed.

1052
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,180
That's great.

1053
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:45,500
All right.

1054
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,619
Fear of fire.

1055
01:36:50,619 --> 01:36:52,380
I wonder why he has a fear of fire.

1056
01:36:53,739 --> 01:36:54,300
No shit.

1057
01:36:58,739 --> 01:36:59,060
Okay.

1058
01:36:59,699 --> 01:37:01,859
We need to get this sorted.

1059
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:04,260
First of all, I'm annoyed that you brought him here,

1060
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,380
but I'm going to eat the peas.

1061
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:07,510
Exy.

1062
01:37:17,479 --> 01:37:18,279
This is so weird.

1063
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,840
I am burnt.

1064
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,479
And nobody's checking on it.

1065
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:26,439
Nobody's caring.

1066
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:28,600
Send them home.

1067
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,039
Well, I need to make friends in the neighborhood.

1068
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:35,050
Yeah, I'm the guy that invited everybody over.

1069
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:35,770
A new neighbor.

1070
01:37:36,569 --> 01:37:39,449
And burnt his house down with a fucking grilled cheese.

1071
01:37:39,449 --> 01:37:40,090
Whatever that was.

1072
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:41,130
I don't even know what that was.

1073
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,010
Eggs or toast?

1074
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:49,930
I have to delete this stuff, though.

1075
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:52,090
Because should I replace the floor?

1076
01:37:56,229 --> 01:37:57,590
Dude, that's what happens when you just jam.

1077
01:38:00,859 --> 01:38:01,579
God damn it.

1078
01:38:01,579 --> 01:38:02,460
How do I fix this?

1079
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,060
Do I have to clean that?

1080
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:06,710
You need a dog bowl?

1081
01:38:07,829 --> 01:38:08,310
Oh, fuck.

1082
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:08,630
You're right.

1083
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:08,869
Okay.

1084
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:12,140
Do I have to replace the floor?

1085
01:38:12,859 --> 01:38:15,899
Just put a big rug there.

1086
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:17,020
No, I have to replace the floor.

1087
01:38:17,659 --> 01:38:29,939
Probably like head hurts.

1088
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:31,140
That was so fucking funny.

1089
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,470
Okay.

1090
01:38:35,689 --> 01:38:36,890
What even is the floor here?

1091
01:38:37,449 --> 01:38:40,260
Which one of these?

1092
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:40,819
I don't remember.

1093
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,529
DIY job.

1094
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:46,569
Sorry.

1095
01:38:51,779 --> 01:38:52,739
No, I don't have a stove.

1096
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:53,619
Let me clean up first.

1097
01:38:55,619 --> 01:39:01,210
I'm going to take a thoughtful shower after that.

1098
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:05,500
Extinguish fire.

1099
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:08,739
Weird.

1100
01:39:16,569 --> 01:39:18,010
Is this going to come out?

1101
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:31,180
People can see you.

1102
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:31,420
What?

1103
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:33,420
Because of this window.

1104
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:35,720
Can you?

1105
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,359
No, you can't.

1106
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:42,739
All right.

1107
01:39:42,739 --> 01:39:44,180
I'll fix that a little bit later.

1108
01:39:46,739 --> 01:39:47,300
All right.

1109
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:47,939
So I need to...

1110
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:50,229
What's wrong?

1111
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:53,189
You want to play?

1112
01:39:53,189 --> 01:39:53,590
All right.

1113
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:56,869
I need a dog bowl.

1114
01:39:59,939 --> 01:40:01,460
You're just going to be permanently scared.

1115
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:02,260
I probably am.

1116
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:04,180
That was ridiculous.

1117
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,340
I've never seen that happen before.

1118
01:40:08,949 --> 01:40:11,590
The first literally one minute of playing the game.

1119
01:40:12,229 --> 01:40:16,380
If you don't have a subway station for a stove

1120
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,539
and get a guy that's never cooked before

1121
01:40:18,539 --> 01:40:19,979
to go pretend to be a chef on it.

1122
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,470
Okay.

1123
01:40:23,829 --> 01:40:24,630
I need a dog bowl.

1124
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:30,140
Where would that be?

1125
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:33,319
Bedroom?

1126
01:40:35,079 --> 01:40:35,479
Oh, wait.

1127
01:40:35,479 --> 01:40:35,640
Okay.

1128
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,039
Here we go.

1129
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,420
So here we go.

1130
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,560
Is this a cat bowl?

1131
01:40:42,199 --> 01:40:43,319
No, this is a dog bowl.

1132
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:49,350
This would be right here.

1133
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:49,670
It's good.

1134
01:40:50,229 --> 01:40:50,729
All right.

1135
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:54,869
Are you scared for life?

1136
01:40:54,869 --> 01:40:55,510
I don't know.

1137
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:56,229
How long does it last?

1138
01:40:57,430 --> 01:40:58,310
57 minutes.

1139
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:58,789
That's not bad.

1140
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:02,489
Oh, somebody filled that?

1141
01:41:03,689 --> 01:41:04,569
When do you guys fill the bowl?

1142
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,140
I'm inspired.

1143
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:15,319
Ooh, maybe next time.

1144
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:17,380
What does it say?

1145
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:19,210
Oh, there we go.

1146
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:19,529
I'm good.

1147
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:20,890
What's my problem?

1148
01:41:21,449 --> 01:41:23,979
What's going on?

1149
01:41:23,979 --> 01:41:25,100
What's my problem?

1150
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:25,899
Maybe next time.

1151
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:28,619
All right.

1152
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:31,880
Fill and call yodel.

1153
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,300
Oh, I need a trash.

1154
01:41:39,319 --> 01:41:41,560
Where is my actual outdoor trash?

1155
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:42,119
Do I have one?

1156
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:44,090
Okay.

1157
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:47,180
I need a trash can and I needed a stove.

1158
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,399
Can I even afford a stove?

1159
01:41:51,399 --> 01:41:52,119
I can.

1160
01:41:52,119 --> 01:41:52,520
All right.

1161
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:53,560
This time don't be an idiot.

1162
01:41:59,180 --> 01:41:59,739
Okay.

1163
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,649
What else was over here besides the stove?

1164
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:04,489
I think anything else damaged?

1165
01:42:04,489 --> 01:42:06,100
This shit's so fucked up.

1166
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:06,899
This stuff's damaged.

1167
01:42:07,539 --> 01:42:09,529
This is damaged.

1168
01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:25,960
Okay.

1169
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,159
Now I just want new counters.

1170
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:35,819
What?

1171
01:42:35,819 --> 01:42:38,779
Look at these.

1172
01:42:38,779 --> 01:42:39,420
Look at these.

1173
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:40,859
Look at the difference.

1174
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:41,899
Why is this one so screwed up?

1175
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:48,390
These ones are burnt.

1176
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,039
What?

1177
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,460
Oh, okay.

1178
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:52,939
Well, whatever.

1179
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:58,939
That's fine.

1180
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:00,779
Let's get this stuff back on the right counters.

1181
01:43:01,659 --> 01:43:02,300
What do I just do?

1182
01:43:02,939 --> 01:43:08,810
Okay.

1183
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:12,140
Coffee maker.

1184
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,220
I need that microwave back.

1185
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:19,829
That's fine.

1186
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:23,140
And then I get just a little place to serve.

1187
01:43:23,859 --> 01:43:25,140
And now I need a trash can.

1188
01:43:25,779 --> 01:43:26,340
That's better.

1189
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:27,829
All right.

1190
01:43:27,829 --> 01:43:30,949
Nice trash right here is good.

1191
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,560
And it's this way.

1192
01:43:34,359 --> 01:43:36,630
How do I make it so it doesn't do this?

1193
01:43:37,189 --> 01:43:39,779
I thought I had that cheat code on.

1194
01:43:43,449 --> 01:43:44,090
Alt.

1195
01:43:44,090 --> 01:43:45,029
Okay.

1196
01:43:45,029 --> 01:43:45,350
Thank you.

1197
01:43:47,369 --> 01:43:47,770
Okay.

1198
01:43:48,329 --> 01:43:48,970
Back to normal.

1199
01:43:49,609 --> 01:43:51,770
What do I have to go to the...

1200
01:43:51,770 --> 01:43:52,729
I have to go to Batu.

1201
01:43:55,189 --> 01:43:55,590
All right.

1202
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:58,119
We got notebook.

1203
01:43:58,119 --> 01:44:00,199
There are no entries in Blorg's notebook.

1204
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:01,319
Blorg.

1205
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:03,079
Allender.

1206
01:44:03,079 --> 01:44:03,319
All right.

1207
01:44:03,319 --> 01:44:03,880
What's coming up?

1208
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,520
Well, this is today.

1209
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:09,159
Add event, right?

1210
01:44:09,159 --> 01:44:09,319
Yeah.

1211
01:44:10,039 --> 01:44:12,300
Well, I was going to write like...

1212
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:13,659
I got it like burnt.

1213
01:44:19,829 --> 01:44:20,630
Winterfest.

1214
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:24,329
Ooh.

1215
01:44:24,329 --> 01:44:24,569
All right.

1216
01:44:24,569 --> 01:44:25,850
Where's Winterfest?

1217
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:27,539
From 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.

1218
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,529
Wait.

1219
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:30,409
It's right now.

1220
01:44:30,409 --> 01:44:30,649
Wait.

1221
01:44:30,649 --> 01:44:31,529
Father Winter.

1222
01:44:31,529 --> 01:44:33,369
Santa Claus is coming in three days.

1223
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:41,720
I have to do festive stuff.

1224
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,600
I'm going to throw a party.

1225
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:51,579
I'm going to be ready to throw a party.

1226
01:44:51,579 --> 01:44:52,699
Can I go in the water?

1227
01:44:59,539 --> 01:45:01,380
Am I going to take my clothes off?

1228
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,380
And excuse me.

1229
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:05,140
Excuse me.

1230
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,000
Yeah.

1231
01:45:16,039 --> 01:45:16,520
Uh-uh.

1232
01:45:17,079 --> 01:45:17,560
Uh-uh.

1233
01:45:18,439 --> 01:45:19,079
Uh-uh.

1234
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:19,319
Go.

1235
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:24,680
This is...

1236
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:28,329
I get in the...

1237
01:45:28,329 --> 01:45:29,050
Go in the water.

1238
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:29,529
Go in the water.

1239
01:45:29,529 --> 01:45:30,170
Hurry the fuck up.

1240
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:31,050
Get in the fucking water, please.

1241
01:45:32,569 --> 01:45:33,770
Oh, my God.

1242
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:37,130
I didn't think he was going to walk out the front door naked.

1243
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:39,380
Did he pee?

1244
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:43,430
What are you doing?

1245
01:45:45,989 --> 01:45:47,029
Go jogging.

1246
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:49,989
No, he's not going to go jogging like this.

1247
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:56,310
Bro, you've got to be kidding me.

1248
01:45:56,949 --> 01:45:58,869
You've actually got to be fucking kidding me.

1249
01:46:15,989 --> 01:46:17,430
Go home.

1250
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:18,390
Go home.

1251
01:46:19,029 --> 01:46:20,149
Go home.

1252
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:21,430
What is wrong with you?

1253
01:46:26,199 --> 01:46:27,000
Who is this?

1254
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:33,340
Hello?

1255
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:34,380
I'm going to introduce...

1256
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:35,659
Wait, is this a famous person?

1257
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:37,739
Ask for a selfie.

1258
01:46:37,739 --> 01:46:43,560
What are you doing?

1259
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,439
What are you calling?

1260
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:46,260
Who is she calling?

1261
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:51,850
You need entertainment, dude.

1262
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:52,569
Where did I go?

1263
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:57,579
Get over there.

1264
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:10,260
Sol Sol!

1265
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:11,140
What's up, buddy?

1266
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:14,100
That's not how I would not introduce myself to a celebrity like that.

1267
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,300
I'd just be like, hey, what's up?

1268
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:15,800
Bro.

1269
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:18,760
Okay.

1270
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:20,979
Global superstar.

1271
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:28,460
Did I have an autograph?

1272
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:33,449
Who asked for a P.A., Floymo?

1273
01:47:34,329 --> 01:47:34,829
Me.

1274
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:37,289
No?

1275
01:47:37,289 --> 01:47:37,930
Oh, okay.

1276
01:47:38,569 --> 01:47:40,060
What about...

1277
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:40,699
Can I take a picture?

1278
01:47:40,699 --> 01:47:41,420
Can we have a picture?

1279
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:43,260
Oh, Pernosa.

1280
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:44,460
Can I have a marathon?

1281
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:45,100
Oh, Espanol.

1282
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:45,659
Damn.

1283
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:46,859
Oh, I need Espanol.

1284
01:47:48,569 --> 01:47:54,300
Um, what else?

1285
01:47:54,779 --> 01:47:55,579
All right, well, bye.

1286
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:57,579
I can't just...

1287
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:03,420
Thank God the fire is out.

1288
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:03,920
Oh.

1289
01:48:06,539 --> 01:48:07,260
You too.

1290
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:12,630
All right, what's wrong with me?

1291
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:18,199
Oh, you're obsessed with the fridge.

1292
01:48:20,539 --> 01:48:21,039
I forgot.

1293
01:48:24,859 --> 01:48:25,359
Yipsy.

1294
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:32,060
There's been a couple of partly unhinged things going on the first 20 minutes of this game.

1295
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:33,659
We're going to try to dial it back a little.

1296
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:40,600
So, I need bladder.

1297
01:48:43,619 --> 01:48:44,680
Hunger.

1298
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,079
Don't...

1299
01:48:45,079 --> 01:48:47,399
This time, I'm eating a snack.

1300
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:48,840
I'm eating a microwaved meal.

1301
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:50,920
We're not touching the stove for a little while.

1302
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:55,220
We're gonna have microwaved chicken nuggets.

1303
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:04,090
Like, the worst way to make chicken nuggets.

1304
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:13,369
That's the worst possible way to do that.

1305
01:49:13,369 --> 01:49:14,409
He needs a new...

1306
01:49:14,409 --> 01:49:14,909
Okay.

1307
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:20,090
So, let's do energy.

1308
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:23,979
Maybe.

1309
01:49:23,979 --> 01:49:25,260
Oh, right, this huge bed.

1310
01:49:25,819 --> 01:49:38,010
Can I actually get in it?

1311
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:38,329
You can't...

1312
01:49:38,329 --> 01:49:40,170
This is not gonna have a problem, right?

1313
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:41,449
It's just microwave chicken nuggets.

1314
01:49:42,789 --> 01:49:45,779
You know where to sit and eat?

1315
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:47,029
It's okay.

1316
01:49:47,029 --> 01:49:47,829
I only have 300 bucks.

1317
01:49:47,829 --> 01:49:48,550
I need to get a job.

1318
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:49,750
I need to make money somehow.

1319
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:56,470
For a second, I thought that was the fire alarm.

1320
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:57,510
No, you can't have any.

1321
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:03,130
Oh, they suck.

1322
01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:05,430
He hates it.

1323
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:10,260
Okay.

1324
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:19,319
Now, why would you do that?

1325
01:50:19,319 --> 01:50:19,960
That's just weird.

1326
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,920
That was weird.

1327
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:25,260
That was very weird.

1328
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,420
Who smells their chicken nuggets like that?

1329
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:29,180
All right.

1330
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:30,060
Let's fill the dog bowl.

1331
01:50:31,029 --> 01:50:33,270
This is why I didn't want like 10 cats, guys.

1332
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:35,829
Because you have to do this.

1333
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:41,180
Where are you going?

1334
01:50:42,409 --> 01:50:43,130
Where are you going?

1335
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:44,250
Just running around?

1336
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:51,270
What else do you need to do?

1337
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:52,630
Listen to kids music.

1338
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:53,270
Is there like a...

1339
01:50:53,909 --> 01:50:55,220
All right.

1340
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,260
My energy is kind of low.

1341
01:50:56,899 --> 01:50:57,539
What should I do for...

1342
01:50:57,539 --> 01:51:01,579
Let me look for a job.

1343
01:51:01,579 --> 01:51:02,460
Where is it?

1344
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:03,100
Business, right?

1345
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:04,539
Okay.

1346
01:51:04,539 --> 01:51:05,979
Buy a restaurant.

1347
01:51:05,979 --> 01:51:07,100
Buy a vet clinic.

1348
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:08,779
Register with the Ministry of Labor.

1349
01:51:08,779 --> 01:51:08,939
All right.

1350
01:51:08,939 --> 01:51:09,579
What about...

1351
01:51:09,579 --> 01:51:10,140
What about a job?

1352
01:51:11,619 --> 01:51:12,500
What can I do?

1353
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:15,369
What should I do?

1354
01:51:15,369 --> 01:51:28,199
Detective, doctor, scientist, or actor is to get the...

1355
01:51:28,199 --> 01:51:29,239
I don't want to be an actor, though.

1356
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:30,869
Critic?

1357
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:34,619
Everyone has an opinion, but not everyone is paid to have it.

1358
01:51:34,619 --> 01:51:38,060
Sims who feel they have superior judgment can either enter the critic career,

1359
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:40,659
food, or the arts.

1360
01:51:40,659 --> 01:51:43,210
Should I be a food critic?

1361
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:54,979
Culinary, freelancer, gardener, painter, politician, salary person, secret agent,

1362
01:51:54,979 --> 01:52:08,020
a style influencer, a babysitter, fast food employee, retail employee, secret agent.

1363
01:52:10,949 --> 01:52:13,109
I don't think this guy is going to be a secret agent.

1364
01:52:13,109 --> 01:52:13,989
No, I need to be a Jedi.

1365
01:52:15,699 --> 01:52:16,579
Can I still do...

1366
01:52:16,579 --> 01:52:18,180
Can I be a secret agent and a Jedi?

1367
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:21,899
Can I be a doctor and a Jedi?

1368
01:52:21,899 --> 01:52:31,220
Does that work?

1369
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:31,699
Right?

1370
01:52:31,699 --> 01:52:38,899
I could be a doctor and a Jedi.

1371
01:52:38,899 --> 01:52:39,779
Should I be a doctor?

1372
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:42,520
I feel like doctors are boring to do in The Sims, though.

1373
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:45,000
That's like, since The Sims 1, that's been a thing you can do.

1374
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,859
Maybe I will do secret agent.

1375
01:52:47,859 --> 01:52:56,039
From infiltrating enemy headquarters to the art of interrogation,

1376
01:52:56,039 --> 01:52:57,640
the more you learn, the less you'll be known.

1377
01:52:58,380 --> 01:52:59,739
Diamond agent and villain.

1378
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:02,119
Should I do this?

1379
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:08,939
Just be a villain?

1380
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,460
Yeah, whatever, let's do it.

1381
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:15,619
Browse intelligence.

1382
01:53:15,619 --> 01:53:17,319
Starts in three days.

1383
01:53:19,539 --> 01:53:21,699
Oh, no, no, it starts tomorrow.

1384
01:53:21,699 --> 01:53:23,369
All right, I got to be ready for work.

1385
01:53:23,369 --> 01:53:29,720
Browse intelligence.

1386
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:30,279
What is it?

1387
01:53:30,279 --> 01:53:31,319
Can I do that on my phone?

1388
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,000
Do I need a computer?

1389
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,039
I need a computer.

1390
01:53:34,039 --> 01:53:34,680
Oh, shit.

1391
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:41,220
Why would you be able to browse intelligence on your phone?

1392
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:43,109
Please get a dog bed.

1393
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:44,470
Do I have enough money for a dog bed?

1394
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:52,060
Oh, yeah, I do.

1395
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:53,500
Let's get like a big one.

1396
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,220
Yeah, this one's good.

1397
01:53:57,210 --> 01:53:58,569
You sleep right here.

1398
01:53:58,569 --> 01:53:59,930
Right next to the frog thing.

1399
01:54:00,489 --> 01:54:02,039
There we go.

1400
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:09,079
Browse high-level government secrets with a...

1401
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,560
Would you say a library computer?

1402
01:54:12,199 --> 01:54:15,420
Hold on a second.

1403
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:17,779
Why am I red?

1404
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:26,649
I don't get it.

1405
01:54:26,649 --> 01:54:32,340
I think it's the light coming off the monitor.

1406
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:34,810
Save, yeah.

1407
01:54:37,029 --> 01:54:38,710
All right, let's do our secret agent career.

1408
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,260
So I got to get up for work tomorrow.

1409
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:44,220
So look at me.

1410
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:44,380
Ready?

1411
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:45,020
Let's get some sleep.

1412
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:46,699
Okay, go on.

1413
01:54:54,949 --> 01:54:56,069
The bed's too big.

1414
01:54:56,069 --> 01:54:57,739
Can you even sit on the bed?

1415
01:54:59,579 --> 01:55:00,619
The bed is way too big.

1416
01:55:00,619 --> 01:55:01,979
Okay, we're going to fix that.

1417
01:55:01,979 --> 01:55:11,210
Did I make it too small?

1418
01:55:12,569 --> 01:55:14,970
Why does it look tiny?

1419
01:55:21,699 --> 01:55:22,420
What's wrong?

1420
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:24,260
This looks so small.

1421
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:27,140
You should go to bed.

1422
01:55:27,939 --> 01:55:28,729
There we go.

1423
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:30,699
Okay.

1424
01:55:30,699 --> 01:55:34,170
All right, I got to get up in seven hours.

1425
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:43,960
There we go.

1426
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:44,359
Raining?

1427
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:46,779
Tense.

1428
01:55:49,529 --> 01:55:53,399
Oh, he's still thinking about the fire.

1429
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:54,439
Watch romance.

1430
01:55:55,539 --> 01:55:56,899
This is such a small TV.

1431
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,010
Browse the web.

1432
01:56:12,279 --> 01:56:13,479
It's 5 a.m., man.

1433
01:56:13,479 --> 01:56:14,039
What are you doing?

1434
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:18,760
All right, I need to eat breakfast in two hours.

1435
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,840
We're going to eat something and I've got to go to the bathroom.

1436
01:56:21,399 --> 01:56:24,010
All right, I'm going to have a quick meal

1437
01:56:24,949 --> 01:56:26,630
and I'm going to just drink blue milk.

1438
01:56:30,819 --> 01:56:31,060
What?

1439
01:56:32,899 --> 01:56:33,699
Blue milk?

1440
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:41,399
Is this supposed to be?

1441
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,600
Is this a Star Wars?

1442
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:46,039
This is the Star Wars thing?

1443
01:56:49,779 --> 01:56:50,899
Oh, I liked it.

1444
01:56:51,939 --> 01:56:53,300
Really flirty.

1445
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:58,760
Okay, work from work starts in about one hour.

1446
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:01,609
Okay.

1447
01:57:01,609 --> 01:57:04,970
How are you doing?

1448
01:57:04,970 --> 01:57:17,500
Bladder, use the bathroom and then wash your hands.

1449
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,699
Brush your teeth too.

1450
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:25,180
Brush your teeth.

1451
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:28,949
Oh, yep, car's going to be here any second.

1452
01:57:29,909 --> 01:57:30,550
And eat.

1453
01:57:33,109 --> 01:57:35,590
Eat the fruitcake that's in your pocket.

1454
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:39,819
Quick, eat it before you go to work.

1455
01:57:39,819 --> 01:57:44,039
Oh, whatever, fine.

1456
01:57:44,039 --> 01:57:44,979
Where are you?

1457
01:57:44,979 --> 01:57:46,100
Where's he going?

1458
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:48,739
Oh, you're off to work.

1459
01:57:48,739 --> 01:57:50,010
Okay.

1460
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:50,970
Hack it.

1461
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:52,649
While performing a routine background check,

1462
01:57:52,649 --> 01:57:54,810
Lord runs into an unexpected firewall.

1463
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:55,449
Hmm.

1464
01:57:55,449 --> 01:57:58,649
He didn't think the information he needed was going to be protected.

1465
01:57:58,649 --> 01:58:00,489
You need to hack through the firewall to dig deeper.

1466
01:58:00,489 --> 01:58:01,689
I'm calling a senior.

1467
01:58:01,689 --> 01:58:04,699
I don't hack it.

1468
01:58:04,699 --> 01:58:10,520
I don't have any experience with a computer.

1469
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:11,880
I don't even own a computer.

1470
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:14,409
I'm going to hack it.

1471
01:58:14,489 --> 01:58:21,579
After some ingenious crypto work,

1472
01:58:21,579 --> 01:58:24,220
Lord beats the firewall and discovers that nothing is what it seems.

1473
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:28,649
He rushes findings to his boss and turns out he's uncovered a nefarious plot.

1474
01:58:28,649 --> 01:58:39,239
$50.

1475
01:58:39,239 --> 01:58:40,359
$50.

1476
01:58:40,359 --> 01:58:47,739
Are you coming back?

1477
01:58:47,739 --> 01:58:49,859
What's wrong?

1478
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:53,939
So gross from using the public bathroom.

1479
01:58:53,939 --> 01:58:59,659
Setting foot in that public bathroom may have been a mistake.

1480
01:58:59,659 --> 01:59:00,779
My public bathroom?

1481
01:59:01,579 --> 01:59:06,550
Or which public bathroom does he not like?

1482
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:07,829
The one at work?

1483
01:59:07,829 --> 01:59:11,640
He's got minty fresh teeth.

1484
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:14,220
What's this?

1485
01:59:14,779 --> 01:59:15,739
Meet a celebrity.

1486
01:59:17,739 --> 01:59:18,539
Oh, okay.

1487
01:59:20,329 --> 01:59:25,020
The humor and hijinks festival is today until four.

1488
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:25,819
Oh, leave work.

1489
01:59:25,819 --> 01:59:26,539
Just leave.

1490
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:28,659
When do I get back from work?

1491
01:59:28,659 --> 01:59:29,939
Can I just leave work?

1492
01:59:29,939 --> 01:59:34,699
I'm not missing this.

1493
01:59:34,699 --> 01:59:37,449
Wait, $75.

1494
01:59:37,449 --> 01:59:40,630
All right.

1495
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:42,550
I'm not going to miss the hijinks festival.

1496
01:59:43,479 --> 01:59:43,960
Where is it?

1497
01:59:45,319 --> 01:59:45,560
All right.

1498
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,359
I'm going to go to the event.

1499
01:59:46,359 --> 01:59:51,819
Let's make sure the dog is okay.

1500
01:59:51,819 --> 01:59:55,449
Stop watching TV.

1501
01:59:55,449 --> 01:59:55,850
All right.

1502
01:59:55,850 --> 02:00:01,960
Now let's say, you know, I've got a skill in comedy.

1503
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:03,000
Oh, all right.

1504
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,140
I take a photo of the dog.

1505
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:26,390
Okay.

1506
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:31,770
Yodel has gained 17 Simstagram followers.

1507
02:00:32,659 --> 02:00:33,140
All right.

1508
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:33,539
Let's go.

1509
02:00:36,939 --> 02:00:38,520
You got food, right?

1510
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:39,319
There's food in the bowl.

1511
02:00:40,970 --> 02:00:41,689
You're good.

1512
02:00:41,689 --> 02:00:42,810
You're just chilling.

1513
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:43,939
Have the TV on.

1514
02:00:43,939 --> 02:00:44,260
All right.

1515
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:44,739
I'm going to...

1516
02:00:44,739 --> 02:00:46,100
I'll eat at the festival.

1517
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:46,739
I want to go to the...

1518
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:48,020
I want to do the festival.

1519
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:49,380
Let's go.

1520
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:54,100
Should I bring Yodel?

1521
02:01:03,909 --> 02:01:04,630
I guess we're going.

1522
02:01:09,609 --> 02:01:11,050
I can't tell if your cam is delayed or not.

1523
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:12,329
People have been saying that the whole stream.

1524
02:01:12,329 --> 02:01:13,770
I don't know why it would be happening.

1525
02:01:14,409 --> 02:01:19,640
I don't know.

1526
02:01:26,409 --> 02:01:26,729
All right.

1527
02:01:27,369 --> 02:01:28,090
I'm here.

1528
02:01:28,090 --> 02:01:31,020
Who's this?

1529
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:32,600
This is a bee-lister.

1530
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:35,609
Okay.

1531
02:01:35,609 --> 02:01:36,569
Chat with Minerva.

1532
02:01:37,130 --> 02:01:40,420
So I have to meet a celebrity and...

1533
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:43,060
Why is the...

1534
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:43,300
Okay.

1535
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:44,340
Where's the dog even going?

1536
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,500
That's a huge TV.

1537
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:49,180
Should I start telling jokes?

1538
02:01:56,229 --> 02:01:57,189
I'm not going to be like that guy.

1539
02:02:01,590 --> 02:02:02,630
I'm not going to be like that guy.

1540
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:03,430
I'm telling you right now.

1541
02:02:03,989 --> 02:02:05,670
I don't know what happened.

1542
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,670
Fainted.

1543
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:07,989
Because you...

1544
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:13,430
Is that going to be all right?

1545
02:02:16,789 --> 02:02:18,149
What are you doing?

1546
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:22,630
This is a weird place to do a photo shoot

1547
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:24,470
in the public bar bathroom.

1548
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:26,520
Get on the mic.

1549
02:02:27,159 --> 02:02:27,640
I got to start.

1550
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,439
I got to impress somebody.

1551
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:31,260
I'm going to practice singing.

1552
02:02:31,979 --> 02:02:33,300
Let's ruin the whole party.

1553
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:51,210
He gave up immediately.

1554
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:52,250
This person's shit-faced,

1555
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:53,930
and they've had one drink, by the way.

1556
02:02:53,930 --> 02:03:02,520
You just gave me two dollars?

1557
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:06,699
People are giving me money.

1558
02:03:06,699 --> 02:03:07,420
Two bucks?

1559
02:03:13,619 --> 02:03:33,350
Congrats on landing that sweet job.

1560
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:34,630
I think this is going to be great for you.

1561
02:03:34,630 --> 02:03:35,189
Oh, thanks.

1562
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:38,060
I thought the bar lit on fire.

1563
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:38,939
I was like, oh my God.

1564
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:49,109
What is happening to people?

1565
02:03:49,109 --> 02:03:51,109
You're face down in trash.

1566
02:03:51,109 --> 02:03:53,000
Somebody needs to help this person.

1567
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:06,229
Is this weird to do in front of the celebrity?

1568
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:19,539
No one's paying.

1569
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:20,979
Wait, squeamish.

1570
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:26,220
Oh, he doesn't like this trash.

1571
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:27,659
I forgot.

1572
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:31,270
But he wanted to play in it.

1573
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:36,489
I have to meet the celebrity.

1574
02:04:39,739 --> 02:04:40,220
Call over.

1575
02:04:41,739 --> 02:04:48,470
You made him do it.

1576
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:48,789
All right.

1577
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:50,630
Didn't I meet this person already

1578
02:04:50,630 --> 02:04:51,189
in front of the house?

1579
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:58,460
What am I holding?

1580
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:02,729
People need to relax.

1581
02:05:05,159 --> 02:05:06,600
What am I eating?

1582
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:09,380
Is this the old fruitcake?

1583
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:14,729
This guy's fucked.

1584
02:05:14,729 --> 02:05:16,329
This guy's a fucking weirdo.

1585
02:05:27,979 --> 02:05:28,699
Photographer.

1586
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:31,829
Wait, I can sell this?

1587
02:05:31,829 --> 02:05:33,510
I can sell the picture of the dog.

1588
02:05:36,699 --> 02:05:37,739
I need to meet a celebrity.

1589
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:42,949
Come over here.

1590
02:05:42,949 --> 02:05:43,430
We need to talk.

1591
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:49,579
All right.

1592
02:05:49,579 --> 02:05:50,619
So let's talk.

1593
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:55,880
How you doing?

1594
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:56,520
Nice to meet you.

1595
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:01,609
Did you see my dog?

1596
02:06:06,569 --> 02:06:07,930
Can I not say anything?

1597
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:08,970
I have to meet a celebrity.

1598
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:09,850
Is this a celebrity?

1599
02:06:11,689 --> 02:06:12,569
What the hell?

1600
02:06:12,569 --> 02:06:13,289
Who smells?

1601
02:06:15,369 --> 02:06:16,170
Who smells?

1602
02:06:21,829 --> 02:06:23,270
Somebody stinks over here.

1603
02:06:23,270 --> 02:06:23,750
Who is it?

1604
02:06:25,270 --> 02:06:25,909
Is it the dog?

1605
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:36,970
Hey, I'm going to come to this

1606
02:06:36,970 --> 02:06:38,409
really cool insider party

1607
02:06:38,409 --> 02:06:40,170
and I'm going to bring my wicked smelly dog.

1608
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:54,550
I need to meet us.

1609
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:56,630
Anybody want one of these old fruitcakes?

1610
02:07:00,789 --> 02:07:02,069
I'm going to put it in front of one of their faces.

1611
02:07:08,979 --> 02:07:16,300
Who's wicked smelly dog is this?

1612
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:16,539
All right.

1613
02:07:16,539 --> 02:07:17,659
I got to get it together.

1614
02:07:18,859 --> 02:07:19,899
Call everybody over.

1615
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,619
Hey, everybody.

1616
02:07:22,619 --> 02:07:23,500
Old fruitcake.

1617
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:26,310
Are people going to eat it?

1618
02:07:34,539 --> 02:07:35,899
Wait, does this smell?

1619
02:07:40,579 --> 02:07:41,460
Yo, we're good.

1620
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:42,260
Okay.

1621
02:07:42,899 --> 02:07:44,039
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1622
02:07:46,729 --> 02:07:47,210
Let's talk.

1623
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:49,130
You like the fruitcake?

1624
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:51,369
I'm going to lie and tell you that I made it.

1625
02:07:53,289 --> 02:07:53,930
Don't do it.

1626
02:07:54,569 --> 02:07:55,050
Don't do it.

1627
02:07:55,609 --> 02:07:56,569
You're going to hit your head.

1628
02:07:56,569 --> 02:07:57,130
Watch your head.

1629
02:07:57,130 --> 02:07:57,609
Watch your head.

1630
02:07:59,989 --> 02:08:01,819
Oh, my God.

1631
02:08:01,819 --> 02:08:04,460
I can't believe Judith Ward was eating dinner.

1632
02:08:06,779 --> 02:08:07,979
I forget the guy's name.

1633
02:08:09,579 --> 02:08:10,140
Did I get it?

1634
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:13,579
Debate.

1635
02:08:14,699 --> 02:08:17,270
It was a fun filled day with a celebrity.

1636
02:08:19,189 --> 02:08:19,989
Are we getting kicked out?

1637
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:39,510
Is this a celebrity?

1638
02:08:40,069 --> 02:08:51,979
Why is this person glowing?

1639
02:08:55,829 --> 02:08:56,310
Wait, what does it say?

1640
02:08:57,659 --> 02:08:58,140
What did that say?

1641
02:08:59,859 --> 02:09:01,699
All lifestyles have a limited amount of progress

1642
02:09:01,699 --> 02:09:02,819
that can be gained daily.

1643
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:06,579
You reach the daily limit or a lifestyle.

1644
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:16,680
Humor and high drinks festival is in town.

1645
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:16,920
What?

1646
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:24,119
That's not where I've been.

1647
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:42,060
All right, put it down and go to the fun festival.

1648
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:42,819
Let's go.

1649
02:09:43,779 --> 02:09:51,300
So this is the high drinks festival.

1650
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:52,260
It was across the street.

1651
02:09:56,739 --> 02:09:57,460
All right.

1652
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:59,939
I'm in a good mood, though.

1653
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,479
So now what do I have to do?

1654
02:10:09,479 --> 02:10:10,520
I have to meet a celebrity.

1655
02:10:13,989 --> 02:10:17,029
Oh, Chorg Chorg is the dog that smells.

1656
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:21,079
Come here.

1657
02:10:21,079 --> 02:10:21,399
Come here.

1658
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:25,699
Don't do that.

1659
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:27,750
What the fuck?

1660
02:10:28,470 --> 02:10:28,949
Yodo.

1661
02:10:39,779 --> 02:10:48,550
OK, you know, you just want me to go home.

1662
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:59,880
With soup, I mean, how do I get to see the the usually

1663
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:00,920
there's something in the top left.

1664
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,520
It gives progress, right?

1665
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:12,149
What's this?

1666
02:11:12,149 --> 02:11:14,439
We look up squids.

1667
02:11:19,369 --> 02:11:27,289
Join the pranksters.

1668
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:30,380
Join the pranksters.

1669
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:34,140
What's this?

1670
02:11:35,909 --> 02:11:37,029
Oh, by swag.

1671
02:11:37,029 --> 02:11:37,590
Let's haggle.

1672
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:44,890
Where are you going?

1673
02:11:45,689 --> 02:11:47,689
Wait, did I smoke?

1674
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:50,100
Sit and try.

1675
02:11:50,739 --> 02:11:51,670
Let's try that.

1676
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:57,979
What are you doing?

1677
02:11:57,979 --> 02:11:58,699
It doesn't like what?

1678
02:12:06,949 --> 02:12:07,909
I guess I don't like it.

1679
02:12:09,479 --> 02:12:10,359
Change the flavor.

1680
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:14,229
How about golden rush?

1681
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:19,140
Let's go light fireworks.

1682
02:12:19,539 --> 02:12:20,260
All right, let's go.

1683
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:20,579
I'm here.

1684
02:12:20,579 --> 02:12:22,140
I'm already here.

1685
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:22,779
Bring some friends.

1686
02:12:22,779 --> 02:12:23,260
I'm already here.

1687
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,880
Light fireworks.

1688
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:32,619
OK, I have to go to work.

1689
02:12:42,979 --> 02:12:43,460
What's this?

1690
02:12:45,130 --> 02:12:45,609
Energize.

1691
02:12:45,609 --> 02:12:46,569
He's keyed up.

1692
02:12:47,289 --> 02:12:50,229
All right, where do I get fireworks?

1693
02:12:50,869 --> 02:12:54,020
Right here, right?

1694
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:56,069
Does not own this item.

1695
02:12:56,630 --> 02:12:57,510
Aren't these fireworks?

1696
02:12:58,979 --> 02:13:00,100
I have to buy them for the stall.

1697
02:13:03,659 --> 02:13:04,220
Where's the dog?

1698
02:13:14,119 --> 02:13:15,159
I invited somebody.

1699
02:13:15,159 --> 02:13:15,960
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1700
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:16,439
Here they are.

1701
02:13:20,539 --> 02:13:22,460
We're going to chat and I got some golden.

1702
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:22,939
What was it called?

1703
02:13:28,699 --> 02:13:29,180
Jokester.

1704
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:38,140
What flavor do you want?

1705
02:13:39,659 --> 02:13:39,899
What?

1706
02:13:41,210 --> 02:13:42,250
Uncomfortable suddenly.

1707
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:44,890
Uncomfortable state of life, but not on the floor.

1708
02:13:44,890 --> 02:13:46,649
Wait, am I like too high or something?

1709
02:13:46,649 --> 02:13:48,010
I don't get what's wrong with me.

1710
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:59,079
I'm going to test singing ever again.

1711
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:02,329
No, let's be.

1712
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:04,649
Let's just, I don't know.

1713
02:14:05,449 --> 02:14:06,489
Wait, somebody's on a mic.

1714
02:14:36,939 --> 02:14:37,979
So they have an aura.

1715
02:14:37,979 --> 02:14:39,020
They have a celebrity.

1716
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:43,000
Where do you get the fireworks?

1717
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:46,409
Because I can't buy them.

1718
02:14:49,159 --> 02:14:49,640
Painting.

1719
02:14:50,199 --> 02:14:52,859
You need to go to the bathroom.

1720
02:14:52,859 --> 02:14:53,739
Is there a bathroom here?

1721
02:14:54,380 --> 02:14:58,939
Where do I buy fireworks?

1722
02:15:03,579 --> 02:15:09,029
Oh, no, no, no.

1723
02:15:09,029 --> 02:15:09,510
I want to do it.

1724
02:15:11,670 --> 02:15:13,060
I want to do it.

1725
02:15:20,949 --> 02:15:22,390
This person just got hurt.

1726
02:15:27,189 --> 02:15:27,829
Oh, I did it.

1727
02:15:27,829 --> 02:15:28,149
I did it.

1728
02:15:35,020 --> 02:15:35,819
Celebrity aura.

1729
02:15:35,819 --> 02:15:36,939
Why is your face so red?

1730
02:15:36,939 --> 02:15:37,340
I don't know.

1731
02:15:38,859 --> 02:15:39,739
Hey, talk to me.

1732
02:15:45,739 --> 02:15:46,619
Getting in line.

1733
02:15:50,939 --> 02:15:56,300
I don't want anyone to know that I shit my pants.

1734
02:16:09,659 --> 02:16:10,060
You're good.

1735
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:11,420
We're good.

1736
02:16:14,739 --> 02:16:16,579
The red face is the celebrity aura.

1737
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:19,989
All right.

1738
02:16:19,989 --> 02:16:20,949
So I love the fireworks.

1739
02:16:21,590 --> 02:16:23,340
Is there anything else I have to do?

1740
02:16:26,710 --> 02:16:27,909
I'm going to buy some food.

1741
02:16:28,939 --> 02:16:30,220
Let's get a, I don't know.

1742
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,180
That's 20 bucks.

1743
02:16:31,899 --> 02:16:32,780
Let's get that.

1744
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:42,059
The game's kind of loud, isn't it?

1745
02:16:42,059 --> 02:16:43,260
Please do the fountain already.

1746
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:50,139
Did I eat?

1747
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:51,979
Okay, I have it.

1748
02:16:58,120 --> 02:16:58,920
I need to eat first.

1749
02:16:59,559 --> 02:17:03,159
Did I leave the plate on?

1750
02:17:03,159 --> 02:17:04,280
I didn't take the plate.

1751
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:06,940
I forgot to take the food with me.

1752
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:11,270
All right.

1753
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:11,510
Eat.

1754
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:15,909
All right.

1755
02:17:15,909 --> 02:17:16,469
Who are these people?

1756
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:17,750
Do you know some of them?

1757
02:17:18,229 --> 02:17:27,180
I don't know.

1758
02:17:27,180 --> 02:17:28,379
There's fire just coming out of my mouth.

1759
02:17:29,989 --> 02:17:31,989
Lord isn't used to eating spicy food.

1760
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:37,450
The time he would be able to eat the spiciest food around.

1761
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:40,010
Wait, what?

1762
02:17:40,729 --> 02:17:42,329
Oh my God.

1763
02:17:42,329 --> 02:17:42,729
The dog.

1764
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:44,569
I need to feed the dog.

1765
02:17:44,569 --> 02:17:47,739
How do I feed the dog?

1766
02:17:52,629 --> 02:17:54,549
I don't know what the dog is even doing here.

1767
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:01,739
Jokesters win.

1768
02:18:02,459 --> 02:18:05,180
All jokesters got 500 bucks and a comedy mic.

1769
02:18:05,739 --> 02:18:06,700
Where did I do it?

1770
02:18:07,579 --> 02:18:12,889
I didn't join a team.

1771
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:17,700
Hurry up.

1772
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:18,100
Join a team.

1773
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:18,899
Quick.

1774
02:18:18,899 --> 02:18:21,530
I'm going to join the jokesters.

1775
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:30,809
Drink the jokester drink.

1776
02:18:36,260 --> 02:18:37,059
Join the jokesters.

1777
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:38,500
Okay.

1778
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:43,049
Perform pranks or something?

1779
02:18:45,319 --> 02:18:47,079
Impossible sausage mine.

1780
02:18:47,079 --> 02:18:48,120
What is that?

1781
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:48,680
What is that?

1782
02:18:49,399 --> 02:18:52,440
Remember the dog.

1783
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,479
You're a little late.

1784
02:19:04,809 --> 02:19:06,969
Eating food from the city unlocks the ability to cook it.

1785
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:07,850
Really?

1786
02:19:07,850 --> 02:19:08,409
That's kind of cool.

1787
02:19:12,170 --> 02:19:12,409
All right.

1788
02:19:12,409 --> 02:19:13,209
Finish up activities.

1789
02:19:13,209 --> 02:19:13,690
That was fun.

1790
02:19:14,729 --> 02:19:16,420
All right.

1791
02:19:16,420 --> 02:19:18,100
We got to go.

1792
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:18,579
Me and the dog.

1793
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:21,399
And I have to go to work tomorrow.

1794
02:19:25,049 --> 02:19:26,809
Do I have any food like dog food?

1795
02:19:28,569 --> 02:19:31,340
What was that?

1796
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:36,500
No.

1797
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:37,219
Stop.

1798
02:19:37,219 --> 02:19:37,940
Turn these off.

1799
02:19:39,299 --> 02:19:39,860
Turn these off.

1800
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:41,139
Enough.

1801
02:19:41,139 --> 02:19:41,940
The festival's over.

1802
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:42,500
Everyone go home.

1803
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,239
Turn that off.

1804
02:19:51,299 --> 02:19:52,659
What is what is what?

1805
02:19:52,659 --> 02:19:54,100
Do I like someone?

1806
02:19:54,979 --> 02:20:00,100
I saw the hearts.

1807
02:20:13,459 --> 02:20:13,860
Raid.

1808
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:14,260
Connery.

1809
02:20:14,260 --> 02:20:15,620
Oh, Connery's pants with the raid.

1810
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:17,139
Welcome everybody.

1811
02:20:19,059 --> 02:20:20,020
Thanks Conner.

1812
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:20,520
Appreciate it.

1813
02:20:22,899 --> 02:20:23,700
I have to.

1814
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:24,659
I got to take.

1815
02:20:24,819 --> 02:20:25,459
I got to take the dog.

1816
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:26,739
We got to go now.

1817
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:29,299
We got to go now.

1818
02:20:29,299 --> 02:20:30,260
We got to go home now.

1819
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:30,579
Bye.

1820
02:20:37,129 --> 02:20:38,090
We got to go.

1821
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:39,129
We got to go.

1822
02:20:39,129 --> 02:20:40,329
I just cleared everybody up.

1823
02:20:41,049 --> 02:20:42,809
Everybody's got cleared out.

1824
02:20:42,809 --> 02:20:43,610
I need to pick this up.

1825
02:20:43,610 --> 02:21:05,079
So we let's go take a bath.

1826
02:21:05,079 --> 02:21:05,559
Bath time.

1827
02:21:12,579 --> 02:21:14,569
Come on.

1828
02:21:14,569 --> 02:21:14,889
Come on.

1829
02:21:14,889 --> 02:21:16,090
Let's go into the bath.

1830
02:21:17,290 --> 02:21:18,090
Yep.

1831
02:21:18,090 --> 02:21:19,850
And then we're going to get you fed.

1832
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:20,969
And why are you so red?

1833
02:21:20,969 --> 02:21:21,770
I don't know.

1834
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:22,329
I had no.

1835
02:21:22,569 --> 02:21:24,489
It's like a thermal camera pointed at my face today.

1836
02:21:24,489 --> 02:21:24,969
I don't know why.

1837
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:28,489
Do I have to go?

1838
02:21:28,489 --> 02:21:29,770
What time is work tomorrow?

1839
02:21:29,770 --> 02:21:30,329
All right.

1840
02:21:30,329 --> 02:21:31,209
I got to be ready for work.

1841
02:21:33,209 --> 02:21:34,889
I actually am not in bad shape.

1842
02:21:35,530 --> 02:21:43,639
Okay.

1843
02:21:43,639 --> 02:21:44,200
That's better.

1844
02:21:46,549 --> 02:21:48,389
Can I see the dog's needs bars?

1845
02:21:53,659 --> 02:21:54,219
Okay.

1846
02:21:54,219 --> 02:21:58,709
Get some food.

1847
02:21:58,709 --> 02:21:59,829
Wash the green off.

1848
02:22:04,809 --> 02:22:05,690
This dog.

1849
02:22:05,690 --> 02:22:06,409
It's yodel.

1850
02:22:09,579 --> 02:22:09,899
Okay.

1851
02:22:09,899 --> 02:22:10,540
Here we go.

1852
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:11,180
Have some food.

1853
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:13,879
I should probably eat something too.

1854
02:22:13,879 --> 02:22:14,360
Right?

1855
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:20,520
I need to learn some skills.

1856
02:22:21,079 --> 02:22:23,959
I need to.

1857
02:22:23,959 --> 02:22:24,440
Okay.

1858
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:26,440
How much is the cheapest computer?

1859
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:27,719
I need a desk and a computer.

1860
02:22:27,719 --> 02:22:28,680
Like a bundle.

1861
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:33,540
What's the cheapest bundle?

1862
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:34,500
They sell it in bundles.

1863
02:22:35,139 --> 02:22:43,000
Oh my God.

1864
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,040
This is a thousand dollars.

1865
02:22:46,379 --> 02:22:47,420
Eight hundred dollars.

1866
02:22:47,979 --> 02:22:49,399
A thousand dollars.

1867
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,120
Go to the library.

1868
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:57,319
Am I actually going to browse sensitive intelligence files at the library?

1869
02:22:57,879 --> 02:23:03,260
Okay.

1870
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:03,899
That's whatever.

1871
02:23:06,299 --> 02:23:07,100
Yes.

1872
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:10,069
What time do I have to get up?

1873
02:23:10,069 --> 02:23:12,649
I think my energy is fine.

1874
02:23:12,649 --> 02:23:13,260
All right.

1875
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:13,899
I'm going to take a nap.

1876
02:23:13,899 --> 02:23:15,180
I'm going to go to the library.

1877
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:19,559
Okay.

1878
02:23:19,559 --> 02:23:20,120
Let's go to bed.

1879
02:23:28,389 --> 02:23:29,030
What are you doing?

1880
02:23:30,920 --> 02:23:31,879
Work starts in an hour.

1881
02:23:31,879 --> 02:23:32,520
All right.

1882
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:33,559
I don't have time to go to the library.

1883
02:23:33,559 --> 02:23:34,520
It doesn't matter.

1884
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:39,819
Have a coffee.

1885
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,819
And then microwave a chicken nuggets.

1886
02:23:44,819 --> 02:23:46,489
That sounds like a plan to me.

1887
02:23:49,370 --> 02:23:49,930
You're good.

1888
02:23:50,489 --> 02:24:02,120
I'll fill your bowl.

1889
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:02,920
You're all right.

1890
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:05,610
I need to.

1891
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:06,459
Okay.

1892
02:24:06,459 --> 02:24:07,659
I need a ball or something.

1893
02:24:07,659 --> 02:24:09,079
I need a ball.

1894
02:24:09,079 --> 02:24:18,200
I need a toy or something.

1895
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:18,440
Right?

1896
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:19,719
Like dog toy.

1897
02:24:19,719 --> 02:24:23,340
Where are they?

1898
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:32,979
These are cat toys.

1899
02:24:34,219 --> 02:24:35,340
Do these count as dog toys?

1900
02:24:35,979 --> 02:24:40,420
Just give them one of these out here.

1901
02:24:45,399 --> 02:24:45,719
All right.

1902
02:24:45,719 --> 02:24:46,760
Go check it out.

1903
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:55,450
Oh, you're going to go for it?

1904
02:25:00,979 --> 02:25:01,780

1905
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:02,899
Oh, he went to work.

1906
02:25:02,899 --> 02:25:07,430
Where's the dog?

1907
02:25:07,430 --> 02:25:14,700
Oh, bottom left for dog needs.

1908
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:19,940
Where?

1909
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:22,389
Use the new poles.

1910
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:22,629
Okay.

1911
02:25:22,629 --> 02:25:23,670
Well, dog's fine.

1912
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:28,520
We're good.

1913
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:29,959
Winterfest starts tomorrow.

1914
02:25:29,959 --> 02:25:30,760
Oh, fuck.

1915
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:41,719
How do I make sure Santa comes?

1916
02:25:41,719 --> 02:25:42,600
File presents?

1917
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:50,389
What's with the scary music?

1918
02:25:54,620 --> 02:25:56,459
Will Santa come if I have presents like this?

1919
02:25:56,459 --> 02:25:57,100
Just on the...

1920
02:25:57,100 --> 02:26:10,489
Just hanging out?

1921
02:26:10,489 --> 02:26:11,829
Add a present.

1922
02:26:11,829 --> 02:26:14,100
Oh, do I have any object?

1923
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:15,139
I'm going to make macaroni and cheese

1924
02:26:15,139 --> 02:26:17,819
or grilled cheese and put it in there.

1925
02:26:17,819 --> 02:26:18,780
I need a fireplace.

1926
02:26:18,780 --> 02:26:19,420
I have a hundred bucks.

1927
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:22,940
That's not going to happen.

1928
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:24,139
I need a fireplace.

1929
02:26:24,139 --> 02:26:25,579
I'm going to have to sell the bed.

1930
02:26:25,579 --> 02:26:33,780
I could sell the public bathroom.

1931
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:34,659
You don't need a fireplace.

1932
02:26:34,659 --> 02:26:41,979
Oh, okay.

1933
02:26:41,979 --> 02:26:42,700

1934
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:45,500
Work until three.

1935
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:45,819
All right.

1936
02:26:48,709 --> 02:26:49,909
Why do I have a public bathroom?

1937
02:26:49,909 --> 02:26:50,149
I don't know.

1938
02:26:50,149 --> 02:26:51,270
I just saw it and I thought it was funny.

1939
02:26:51,829 --> 02:26:53,350
Put it in here.

1940
02:26:53,350 --> 02:26:54,549
All right.

1941
02:26:54,549 --> 02:26:55,430
Let's prepare the house.

1942
02:26:55,430 --> 02:26:56,469
Let's have a Christmas party.

1943
02:26:56,469 --> 02:26:58,149
I'm going to throw a holiday party.

1944
02:26:58,149 --> 02:27:00,680
So let's do that.

1945
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:03,209
So tomorrow I want...

1946
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:07,770

02:27:11,530 --> 02:27:12,170
Add event.

1948
02:27:13,819 --> 02:27:14,139
Okay.

1949
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:19,909
Should I just invite people over tomorrow?

1950
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:27,399
Plan a social event.

1951
02:27:27,399 --> 02:27:27,639
Okay.

1952
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:34,260
All right.

1953
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:37,450
The social event is going to be a house party

1954
02:27:39,879 --> 02:27:43,770

1955
02:27:44,409 --> 02:27:46,489

1960
02:27:59,079 --> 02:27:59,959
No, I don't need this.

1961
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:01,399
I don't need to cater.

1962
02:28:01,399 --> 02:28:02,200
I'm just going to order a pizza.

1963
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:08,729
No, this is right now.

1964
02:28:08,729 --> 02:28:10,010
I want to do it for tomorrow.

1965
02:28:11,750 --> 02:28:13,270
Oh, I have to order a pizza quick.

1966
02:28:13,430 --> 02:28:14,149

1967
02:28:21,079 --> 02:28:21,959
How do I order a pizza?

1968
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:24,649
Oh, shit.

1969
02:28:24,649 --> 02:28:25,290

1970
02:28:27,909 --> 02:28:28,709

1974
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:35,000

1976
02:28:35,559 --> 02:28:35,879

1977
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:37,479
No, these are so expensive.

1979
02:28:43,530 --> 02:28:44,649

1984
02:29:11,079 --> 02:29:11,399

1986
02:29:13,639 --> 02:29:14,280
What?

1987
02:29:14,280 --> 02:29:15,989
What am I putting here?

1988
02:29:18,469 --> 02:29:20,709
My dog is my closest friend.

1989
02:29:20,709 --> 02:29:21,190
That's true.

02:29:25,459 --> 02:29:29,379

02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:44,219
I hate video games.

1997
02:29:44,219 --> 02:29:44,860
Put it down.

1998
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:45,500

Why is he going to bed?

2052
02:32:39,799 --> 02:32:41,239
You fucking weirdo.

2053
02:32:42,329 --> 02:32:43,690
Why is he locked out of his...

2054
02:32:43,690 --> 02:32:45,129
Why is he locked inside of his...

2055
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:47,350
Can somebody get the door?

2056
02:32:50,549 --> 02:32:53,110

02:32:54,739 --> 02:32:55,700
Make another door quick.

2059
02:32:59,590 --> 02:33:00,629
This guy would have left.

2060
02:33:01,270 --> 02:33:01,670
You know what?

2061
02:33:01,670 --> 02:33:02,469
Just get rid of the door.

2062
02:33:03,190 --> 02:33:05,940
Just open it.

2063
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:07,059

2064
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:10,520
I ordered that pizza and I'm going to get it.

2065
02:33:11,590 --> 02:33:13,190
I ordered that pizza.

2066
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:15,690

2070
02:33:26,979 --> 02:33:28,340
Just walk into the house.

2071
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:29,059
Walk into the house.

2072
02:33:29,059 --> 02:33:29,540
I'm right here.

2073
02:33:41,110 --> 02:33:44,520
Why can you all leave and I can't?

2074
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:47,000
No, he's eating the old fruitcake in his pocket.

2075
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,440
There's a pizza out here.

2076
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:49,239
I paid for it.

2077
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:57,020
What the...

2078
02:34:09,350 --> 02:34:13,909
Everybody, there's going to be sand in this pizza.

2079
02:34:15,670 --> 02:34:18,629
Imagine putting a pizza on the ground at the beach.

2080
02:34:20,069 --> 02:34:21,030
You wouldn't pay me to eat this.

2081
02:34:23,430 --> 02:34:24,870
You didn't show up to claim your pizza,

2082
02:34:24,870 --> 02:34:29,510
so I charged you $25 and left it outside the ants to enjoy.

2083
02:34:36,569 --> 02:34:37,610
Everybody was going to leave.

2084
02:34:38,569 --> 02:34:39,930
Have Sims kiss?

2085
02:34:39,930 --> 02:34:41,780
What?

2086
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:42,899
All right, we got our pizza.

2087
02:34:44,180 --> 02:34:45,059
Everything's good to go.

2088
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:46,500
All right, let's bring...

2089
02:34:47,139 --> 02:34:48,920
Bring the party back inside.

2090
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:49,319
What do you say?

2091
02:34:49,319 --> 02:34:49,959
Come on, everybody.

2092
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:01,899
You talking shit to my dog?

2093
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:11,000
What are you saying?

2094
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:13,559
Excuse...

2095
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:18,100
And people just coming in and yelling at my dog.

2096
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:31,180
I think I'm stuck between three people.

2097
02:35:33,819 --> 02:35:36,010
All right, that was fun.

2098
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:36,489
Enough of that.

2099
02:35:39,049 --> 02:35:39,770
Clean up the pizza.

2100
02:35:39,770 --> 02:35:40,729
I need to fill the dog bowl.

2101
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:44,840
You okay?

2102
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:45,559
What's going on?

2103
02:35:57,500 --> 02:35:58,459
Who talks shit to my dog?

2104
02:36:04,229 --> 02:36:05,750
Why am I dressed like this?

2105
02:36:14,069 --> 02:36:14,469
Come here.

2106
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:17,829
Bro, make him leave.

2107
02:36:18,709 --> 02:36:19,190
Cake.

2108
02:36:19,909 --> 02:36:21,750
Oh, wait, it's time for somebody to have a present.

2109
02:36:23,690 --> 02:36:25,770
All right, everybody, it's time.

2110
02:36:25,770 --> 02:36:27,370
Merry Christmas.

2111
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:29,879
It's time for all of us to open the presents.

2112
02:36:41,479 --> 02:36:42,520
No, open the presents.

2113
02:36:50,139 --> 02:36:50,700
Presents.

2114
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:51,420
Open the presents.

2115
02:36:55,940 --> 02:36:56,420
Here we go.

2116
02:36:57,879 --> 02:36:58,600
All right, everybody.

2117
02:36:59,239 --> 02:37:01,139
There's stuff under there for pretty much everyone.

2118
02:37:02,260 --> 02:37:03,059
Merry Christmas.

2119
02:37:03,059 --> 02:37:04,579
Thanks for coming to the party.

2120
02:37:04,579 --> 02:37:05,540
I hope everyone had a good time.

2121
02:37:06,819 --> 02:37:08,180
Let's go ahead and get those presents open.

2122
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:11,719
Let's see what I got.

2123
02:37:13,399 --> 02:37:13,959
I got...

2124
02:37:15,239 --> 02:37:16,040
I can't believe it.

2125
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:16,280
It's...

2126
02:37:19,129 --> 02:37:20,010
Who would give one...

2127
02:37:20,010 --> 02:37:20,250
What?

2128
02:37:21,850 --> 02:37:22,329
What'd you get?

2129
02:37:27,049 --> 02:37:27,530
What'd you get?

2130
02:37:27,850 --> 02:37:28,329
What did you get?

2131
02:37:36,329 --> 02:37:38,329
There's nothing in each one of these boxes.

2132
02:37:51,370 --> 02:37:52,329
Open the presents.

2133
02:37:54,329 --> 02:37:57,020
Hey, this one's for you, son.

2134
02:37:59,239 --> 02:38:00,040
New frog.

2135
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:06,459
How come no one's opening presents?

2136
02:38:12,219 --> 02:38:13,420
Complaining about video games.

2137
02:38:17,739 --> 02:38:18,620
Oh, my God, I smell.

2138
02:38:26,139 --> 02:38:27,020
What is going on here?

2139
02:38:29,819 --> 02:38:30,299
What was that?

2140
02:38:32,139 --> 02:38:32,299
Oh, shit.

2141
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:38,059
Lord McGulty has identified the goldfish,

2142
02:38:38,059 --> 02:38:41,100
a new type of fish recorded in certain fishing spots.

2143
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:48,739
How did I learn that?

2144
02:38:53,059 --> 02:38:54,100
All right, everybody get out.

2145
02:38:56,180 --> 02:38:56,579
All right.

2146
02:38:58,819 --> 02:38:59,940
Oh, shit, the coffee maker.

2147
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:06,899
Everybody out now.

2148
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:08,579
Everybody get out of here.

2149
02:39:20,579 --> 02:39:21,860
All right, actually, I want to be your friend

2150
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:23,219
because you're actually really nice.

2151
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:26,020
This person's really nice and actually helping.

2152
02:39:27,219 --> 02:39:28,659
What's the person's name?

2153
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:32,040
Is her name Hillary?

2154
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:33,239
Lawrence.

2155
02:39:33,239 --> 02:39:34,840
All right, I want to talk to Hillary.

2156
02:39:37,399 --> 02:39:39,079
Look at the people that are actually helping.

2157
02:39:39,079 --> 02:39:40,200
You know how much we're panning the asses

2158
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:41,239
to put a huge house party on?

2159
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:43,500
Yeah.

2160
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:46,280
You don't understand, it takes like three days

2161
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:48,120
to come back from a house party like this.

2162
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:49,479
Like you brought like a bunch of people over.

2163
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:51,799
It takes days to clean this up.

2164
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:53,079
I appreciate it.

2165
02:39:58,090 --> 02:39:59,209
That's not me in the bed.

2166
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:03,239
Wait, what?

2167
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:05,159
Who is this lady?

2168
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:15,659
What?

2169
02:40:15,659 --> 02:40:16,139
Why is it?

2170
02:40:16,139 --> 02:40:16,700
What does that mean?

2171
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:18,540
Assigned to left side.

2172
02:40:19,659 --> 02:40:22,219
Did you just claim the bed?

2173
02:40:24,299 --> 02:40:25,420
I'm very confused.

2174
02:40:26,219 --> 02:40:42,020
Everybody fucking leave.

2175
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:43,299
How do I kick everybody out of here?

2176
02:40:44,180 --> 02:40:45,299
Wait, he's putting a person in.

2177
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:48,100
I'm going to look and see what it is.

2178
02:40:56,649 --> 02:40:56,969
And?

2179
02:41:01,530 --> 02:41:01,930
What is it?

2180
02:41:03,850 --> 02:41:04,489
Is it nothing?

2181
02:41:05,129 --> 02:41:09,770
Don't sleep in my bed.

2182
02:41:12,889 --> 02:41:14,170
All right, that was a fun party.

2183
02:41:14,170 --> 02:41:15,049
Now, everybody get out.

2184
02:41:18,250 --> 02:41:18,889
I am pissed.

2185
02:41:18,889 --> 02:41:20,170
I want everybody to leave so bad.

2186
02:41:20,170 --> 02:41:21,209
How do I kick everybody out of here?

2187
02:41:29,450 --> 02:41:31,530
It is midnight and they're still here.

2188
02:41:33,049 --> 02:41:34,489
This kid's going to my fridge.

2189
02:41:34,489 --> 02:41:34,969
Excuse me.

2190
02:41:34,969 --> 02:41:35,290
What's this?

2191
02:41:39,860 --> 02:41:40,420
Pay for that?

2192
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:50,360
Money got deducted from my account when he opened the door.

2193
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:53,270
I mean, I appreciate it.

2194
02:41:53,270 --> 02:41:53,510
Thanks.

2195
02:41:54,709 --> 02:41:55,450
Why was there?

2196
02:41:56,649 --> 02:41:57,129
Did they?

2197
02:41:57,930 --> 02:42:02,600
It's taking out fucking booze out of the fridge.

2198
02:42:03,319 --> 02:42:04,200
Put that down.

2199
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:04,600
What is it?

2200
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:05,319
Oh, it's orange juice.

2201
02:42:05,319 --> 02:42:05,639
All right.

2202
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:13,209
I think they took all the dirty dishes

2203
02:42:15,930 --> 02:42:17,290
and they put them into the fridge

2204
02:42:18,489 --> 02:42:22,579
because there's nowhere else to put them.

2205
02:42:27,989 --> 02:42:40,309
These people are very comfortable here, apparently.

2206
02:42:41,350 --> 02:42:45,030
Apparently, you're incredibly comfortable to take a bath in my house.

2207
02:42:45,989 --> 02:42:49,989
And I literally, we met 12 hours ago

2208
02:42:51,989 --> 02:42:52,870
and you make it a mess.

2209
02:42:55,799 --> 02:42:57,399
It's 1 15 in the morning.

2210
02:42:58,040 --> 02:43:01,209
These people, excuse me.

2211
02:43:04,090 --> 02:43:05,530
Why are they still here?

2212
02:43:17,959 --> 02:43:19,319
This guy insulted your dog.

2213
02:43:21,379 --> 02:43:22,659
Wait, he's got a Christmas sweater on.

2214
02:43:23,719 --> 02:43:25,000
He's the only festive one here.

2215
02:43:25,799 --> 02:43:28,020
He's the only one that cares about being festive.

2216
02:43:34,459 --> 02:43:36,219
We're going on two o'clock in the morning.

2217
02:43:40,219 --> 02:43:51,530
She wanted to get in the bed and got mad

2218
02:43:51,530 --> 02:43:53,209
because I was on her side of the bed

2219
02:43:54,489 --> 02:43:56,090
and now she's talking into the mirror.

2220
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:05,180
What are you doing?

2221
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:06,299
You're making like a souffle.

2222
02:44:08,170 --> 02:44:09,850
Why are these people just claiming my house?

2223
02:44:24,709 --> 02:44:43,610
I thought everybody has to go so bad.

2224
02:44:51,139 --> 02:44:53,620
I've never seen this happen in The Sims before.

2225
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:56,500
They usually leave at like 11 o'clock at night.

2226
02:45:00,200 --> 02:45:01,959
They're all here at three o'clock.

2227
02:45:01,959 --> 02:45:05,079
Even the kid, there's a little kid here at three a.m.

2228
02:45:07,129 --> 02:45:07,690
Send them home.

2229
02:45:07,690 --> 02:45:08,170
I already did.

2230
02:45:08,170 --> 02:45:09,690
It said my party wasn't successful.

2231
02:45:10,329 --> 02:45:11,530
Everyone's going to leave now or something.

2232
02:45:13,350 --> 02:45:15,030
They're going to be here until I get up in the morning.

2233
02:45:31,559 --> 02:45:34,200
Are they actually going to stay here all day, all night?

2234
02:45:35,239 --> 02:45:37,000
They have to be, they have to go back to sleep.

2235
02:45:39,370 --> 02:45:40,329
They're making coffee.

2236
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:50,549
Bro, enjoy yourself.

2237
02:45:51,110 --> 02:45:52,309
Have another, have a latte.

2238
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:02,139
It's almost time for me to wake up in the morning.

2239
02:46:06,489 --> 02:46:08,090
It's just a bath house.

2240
02:46:08,090 --> 02:46:10,329
I'm actually, I don't understand what's happening right now.

2241
02:46:12,899 --> 02:46:13,620
These people are fighting.

2242
02:46:27,190 --> 02:46:28,229
It's Christmas now.

2243
02:46:31,129 --> 02:46:32,729
Okay, get up, get up, get up.

2244
02:46:33,290 --> 02:46:34,090
Use the bathroom.

2245
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:40,860
Guys, I can't make them leave.

2246
02:46:41,659 --> 02:46:43,340
There's no send home option.

2247
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:48,219
They all live here now.

2248
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:54,760
Go home.

2249
02:46:55,399 --> 02:46:56,920
Stop drinking coffee in my bed.

2250
02:47:01,690 --> 02:47:04,010
Hey, all right, get it, you're out.

2251
02:47:04,969 --> 02:47:05,690
Get out of here.

2252
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,440
Did I go to work?

2253
02:47:26,059 --> 02:47:27,819
Winterfest is starting now.

2254
02:47:27,819 --> 02:47:29,979
Okay, well glad everybody here was here for the quiche.

2255
02:47:30,379 --> 02:47:31,860
Winterfest?

2256
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:43,510
Everybody ready to sing?

2257
02:47:43,510 --> 02:47:44,309
I guess.

2258
02:47:44,870 --> 02:47:57,559
Nobody slept in 20.

2259
02:48:21,350 --> 02:48:24,790
He looked like he was about to go fist in the present.

2260
02:48:33,159 --> 02:48:34,440
I seriously thought he was gonna pee.

2261
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:36,440
I thought he was gonna go down and take his shit in the present.

2262
02:48:37,719 --> 02:48:39,079
All right, party's over.

2263
02:48:41,530 --> 02:48:44,920
Okay, happy, happy birthday.

2264
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:49,909
Is Santa gonna show up or do I actually need a fireplace?

2265
02:48:55,270 --> 02:48:57,209
All right, I'll take some coffee.

2266
02:48:58,659 --> 02:48:59,379
Thank you.

2267
02:48:59,459 --> 02:49:00,659
Okay, goodbye.

2268
02:49:02,579 --> 02:49:04,420
Let's share Winterfest spirit.

2269
02:49:05,299 --> 02:49:08,680
Catch Father Winter and ask him for a present to satisfy.

2270
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:11,319
Hey, Winter, hey, here's an 8 p.m. near fireplaces.

2271
02:49:12,440 --> 02:49:13,319
I'm selling something.

2272
02:49:13,319 --> 02:49:14,360
I'm selling the fucking outhouse.

2273
02:49:18,040 --> 02:49:19,479
We need a fireplace.

2274
02:49:19,479 --> 02:49:21,959
Everyone's gonna be trapped here for some weird reason.

2275
02:49:21,959 --> 02:49:22,760
I need a fireplace.

2276
02:49:28,969 --> 02:49:30,010
We need open presents.

2277
02:49:30,250 --> 02:49:34,889
Okay, presents, open presents and stuff.

2278
02:49:37,209 --> 02:49:39,049
Every, even cavemen.

2279
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:43,850
Click on yourself is an option to make people leave.

2280
02:49:48,250 --> 02:49:48,969
No, there isn't.

2281
02:49:51,340 --> 02:49:52,059
They just won't.

2282
02:49:52,059 --> 02:49:53,260
They're just stuck here forever.

2283
02:49:57,180 --> 02:49:59,500
You, where's the option to get rid of everybody?

2284
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:01,579
Get actions, form a group.

2285
02:50:04,500 --> 02:50:07,860
Click on the door.

2286
02:50:08,420 --> 02:50:09,139
There is no door.

2287
02:50:09,139 --> 02:50:10,899
I deleted it because the pizza guy couldn't get in.

2288
02:50:12,780 --> 02:50:16,059
This is drinking coffee and using the microwave and taking a bath in my house.

2289
02:50:16,700 --> 02:50:19,139
I need to, okay, I need a, uh.

2290
02:50:21,670 --> 02:50:22,950
I, we're selling.

2291
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:23,750
I'm getting rid of this.

2292
02:50:24,309 --> 02:50:26,229
I'm buying one single fucking toilet.

2293
02:50:26,229 --> 02:50:27,750
This thing was like five grand.

2294
02:50:28,790 --> 02:50:31,450
I need, we need a fireplace for the Santa Claus.

2295
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:38,500
Let's put a regular toilet in here.

2296
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:41,620
And now I have 2,000 more dollars.

2297
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:44,180
I don't know.

2298
02:50:44,180 --> 02:50:45,620
This is like the chic one, whatever.

2299
02:50:48,180 --> 02:50:51,799
Okay, good to go.

2300
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:53,399
Now I need a fireplace.

2301
02:50:57,260 --> 02:50:58,139
What's the cheapest one?

2302
02:51:01,209 --> 02:51:01,930
600 bucks.

2303
02:51:02,489 --> 02:51:04,969
This thing's cheap.

2304
02:51:04,969 --> 02:51:05,610
It doesn't matter.

2305
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:06,090
We just waited.

2306
02:51:06,090 --> 02:51:08,659
We just need presents from, there you go.

2307
02:51:08,659 --> 02:51:09,860
Okay, I need a door.

2308
02:51:10,809 --> 02:51:12,489
There's, I don't need a door.

2309
02:51:12,489 --> 02:51:14,709
Okay, here we go.

2310
02:51:15,350 --> 02:51:18,620
How do I light the fireplace?

2311
02:51:32,389 --> 02:51:33,430
Can somebody else do it?

2312
02:51:38,409 --> 02:51:40,840
Oh, you know what?

2313
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:43,479
The worst part about this is people won't leave.

2314
02:51:43,479 --> 02:51:44,440
I can't make them leave.

2315
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:45,959
There's no option to make them leave.

2316
02:51:45,959 --> 02:51:50,440
But yet every time they open the fridge, it deducts $20 from my bank account.

2317
02:51:51,159 --> 02:51:56,440
I am housing 15 people right now and they all have their own houses

2318
02:51:56,440 --> 02:51:58,040
and they're spending all my money.

2319
02:52:07,379 --> 02:52:08,020
I need a door.

2320
02:52:08,020 --> 02:52:09,780
I had a door before and it locked us all in.

2321
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:16,459
They'll leave after Christmas.

2322
02:52:20,459 --> 02:52:21,739
Buy a real door.

2323
02:52:21,739 --> 02:52:22,540
Change the door.

2324
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:23,340
I will.

2325
02:52:23,340 --> 02:52:24,860
Vloggers learn the trade.

2326
02:52:24,860 --> 02:52:25,180
Mean.

2327
02:52:30,579 --> 02:52:31,700
Somebody left.

2328
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:32,340
Holy shit.

2329
02:52:32,340 --> 02:52:32,899
Somebody got out.

2330
02:52:34,969 --> 02:52:38,780
Somebody actually got out.

2331
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:40,700
Where are you going is the real question.

2332
02:52:40,700 --> 02:52:52,469
The most festive person didn't wait for Santa Claus.

2333
02:52:52,469 --> 02:52:54,870
Without a door, your house is a public place.

2334
02:52:58,899 --> 02:52:59,399
What?

2335
02:53:02,809 --> 02:53:05,770
It's a public place?

2336
02:53:07,989 --> 02:53:10,950
Even if it is a public place, why are they here for two straight days?

2337
02:53:10,950 --> 02:53:11,670
They would have left.

2338
02:53:27,420 --> 02:53:29,659
You wouldn't stay in a public place for two days.

2339
02:53:29,659 --> 02:53:33,450
I have a door now.

2340
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:37,340
Now click it.

2341
02:53:37,899 --> 02:53:47,049
What's wrong with this roof?

2342
02:53:53,340 --> 02:53:54,059
We need to clean up.

2343
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:56,459
I'm waiting for...

2344
02:53:56,459 --> 02:53:57,340
I'll order another pizza.

2345
02:53:57,739 --> 02:53:58,780
Spiegel, stop opening the fridge.

2346
02:53:58,780 --> 02:53:59,659
I'm going to order a pizza.

2347
02:54:12,329 --> 02:54:13,850
Dog needs a bath.

2348
02:54:21,290 --> 02:54:22,649
Didn't I pick this up off the floor?

2349
02:54:22,649 --> 02:54:23,690
Why am I eating this?

2350
02:54:25,290 --> 02:54:30,739
How did I get 800?

2351
02:54:30,739 --> 02:54:31,780
Oh, because I sold the...

2352
02:54:31,780 --> 02:54:33,059
I sold the public bathroom.

2353
02:54:35,620 --> 02:54:39,020
Coffee maker is broken.

2354
02:54:39,020 --> 02:54:39,979
Coffee maker is broken.

2355
02:54:41,899 --> 02:54:42,620
Just get another one.

2356
02:54:42,620 --> 02:54:43,020
I don't care.

2357
02:54:49,319 --> 02:54:50,440
Invite a werewolf.

2358
02:54:56,120 --> 02:54:57,239
I need to wait for Santa to come.

2359
02:54:59,399 --> 02:55:00,680
Can somebody else light this though?

2360
02:55:02,920 --> 02:55:04,600
Click door and say no trespasses.

2361
02:55:09,219 --> 02:55:14,139
Well, I don't want to dis...

2362
02:55:14,139 --> 02:55:15,899
I don't want to disallow everybody.

2363
02:55:16,620 --> 02:55:17,979
This is not how you do it.

2364
02:55:21,299 --> 02:55:23,059
I don't want to disallow neighbors.

2365
02:55:23,059 --> 02:55:25,059
I want them to be able to come over, but...

2366
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:30,280
Ask to leave under friendly.

2367
02:55:42,379 --> 02:55:43,340
Something that's really...

2368
02:55:44,299 --> 02:55:47,979
This whole routine of making a coffee and taking a bath.

2369
02:55:49,510 --> 02:55:51,590
My water bill is going to be crazy this week.

2370
02:55:51,590 --> 02:55:52,069
This month.

2371
02:55:54,979 --> 02:55:56,819
I don't understand how none of them have gone to sleep.

2372
02:55:56,819 --> 02:55:58,020
None of them have slept in two days.

2373
02:56:01,579 --> 02:56:03,020
Lord is a lazy sim.

2374
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:04,299
They like watching TV.

2375
02:56:08,409 --> 02:56:09,690
All right, let me do the dog a bath.

2376
02:56:13,459 --> 02:56:14,659
Stop watching TV and getting...

2377
02:56:14,659 --> 02:56:15,459
You got to do some stuff.

2378
02:56:16,659 --> 02:56:17,059
Clean up.

2379
02:56:22,569 --> 02:56:23,049
Take a bath.

2380
02:56:26,360 --> 02:56:27,159
Exercising.

2381
02:56:35,559 --> 02:56:38,149
I guess you're going to open the fridge and take something out.

2382
02:56:38,149 --> 02:56:39,270
You're going to charge me $20.

2383
02:56:39,270 --> 02:56:48,340
Look, I'm giving the dog a bath right now.

2384
02:56:48,340 --> 02:56:48,659
You can't...

2385
02:56:57,700 --> 02:56:58,979
Is Santa actually going to appear?

2386
02:56:58,979 --> 02:57:00,500
Yeah, if you have a fireplace, which I do.

2387
02:57:00,500 --> 02:57:01,540
And it's 8 p.m.

2388
02:57:01,540 --> 02:57:03,139
That's the only reason why I haven't kicked everybody out yet.

2389
02:57:03,139 --> 02:57:03,459
Or try...

2390
02:57:03,459 --> 02:57:04,979
I mean, they're just here.

2391
02:57:07,139 --> 02:57:08,100
I need to go to sleep.

2392
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:10,899
Sleep.

2393
02:57:13,059 --> 02:57:13,459
Sleep.

2394
02:57:13,459 --> 02:57:14,500
Move out of the way.

2395
02:57:14,500 --> 02:57:15,139
Everyone get out of the way.

2396
02:57:15,139 --> 02:57:16,020
You can talk in the other room.

2397
02:57:20,790 --> 02:57:21,510
Stop.

2398
02:57:21,510 --> 02:57:22,469
Get away from my bed.

2399
02:57:25,670 --> 02:57:28,520
What a rush.

2400
02:57:28,520 --> 02:57:31,079
The boost of adrenaline is making Lord feel amazing.

2401
02:57:31,079 --> 02:57:34,840
Should he finally embrace it with his astonishingly sculpted arms that he likes fitness?

2402
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:35,079
No.

2403
02:57:36,629 --> 02:57:36,870
No.

2404
02:57:38,739 --> 02:57:39,379
What does that mean?

2405
02:57:48,020 --> 02:57:48,979
Okay, this person's cooking.

2406
02:57:51,110 --> 02:57:52,309
Should we sing together again?

2407
02:57:56,139 --> 02:57:59,020
Oh, kookaloy y'all meat.

2408
02:57:59,020 --> 02:57:59,739
Oh.

2409
02:57:59,739 --> 02:58:01,100
Plus one future cube?

2410
02:58:03,100 --> 02:58:03,340
What?

2411
02:58:04,059 --> 02:58:06,329
I got a future cube?

2412
02:58:09,690 --> 02:58:14,219
Quick yourself.

2413
02:58:15,770 --> 02:58:17,930
Guys, there is no make people leave.

2414
02:58:19,829 --> 02:58:21,190
The game is broken.

2415
02:58:21,190 --> 02:58:24,950
And I was waiting for Santa to show up before I reload the game and kick everybody out.

2416
02:58:24,950 --> 02:58:32,649
Somebody else left.

2417
02:58:32,649 --> 02:58:34,250
We were so close to Santa.

2418
02:58:37,049 --> 02:58:38,010
All right, so the cube...

2419
02:58:38,010 --> 02:58:38,649
Where's the cube?

2420
02:58:40,250 --> 02:58:41,209
Tag, tag.

2421
02:58:48,739 --> 02:58:52,969
It's on the counter.

2422
02:58:55,450 --> 02:58:56,090
Everybody ready?

2423
02:59:00,250 --> 02:59:01,930
Santa will be showing up very soon.

2424
02:59:05,450 --> 02:59:06,569
I was going to say happy birthday.

2425
02:59:17,610 --> 02:59:36,250
Happy birthday to Santa.

2426
02:59:36,250 --> 02:59:37,610
Worst party ever.

2427
02:59:41,049 --> 02:59:45,209
Will he be brave enough to throw another party after how badly this one went?

2428
02:59:45,530 --> 02:59:47,739
Tag, tag.

2429
02:59:47,739 --> 02:59:53,110
But Santa hasn't even showed up yet.

2430
02:59:53,110 --> 02:59:56,950
They're all actually leaving right before the big moment where Santa comes.

2431
02:59:58,860 --> 03:00:00,620
You've been here for three days.

2432
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:02,540
Three days.

2433
03:00:02,540 --> 03:00:07,020
At least you're still here.

2434
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:14,120
I'm sorry for that party.

2435
03:00:14,120 --> 03:00:14,760
It was so bad.

2436
03:00:16,860 --> 03:00:18,219
It was an awful party.

2437
03:00:19,620 --> 03:00:20,180
What do you need?

2438
03:00:25,299 --> 03:00:25,940
What's wrong now?

2439
03:00:25,940 --> 03:00:30,969
Okay.

2440
03:00:30,969 --> 03:00:33,450
How about let's sing another song.

2441
03:00:42,489 --> 03:00:44,889
And sing pop songs duet with other Sims.

2442
03:00:50,409 --> 03:00:50,729
Hold on.

2443
03:00:50,729 --> 03:00:51,930
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2444
03:00:51,930 --> 03:00:53,129
This is not we're not doing that.

2445
03:00:55,690 --> 03:00:56,649
Give a Winterfest gift.

2446
03:00:59,139 --> 03:01:00,500
Oh, all I have is dog shit.

2447
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:01,139
All right.

2448
03:01:01,139 --> 03:01:04,250
A ball of wooden children's toy.

2449
03:01:04,250 --> 03:01:04,809
An apple.

2450
03:01:05,370 --> 03:01:07,590
A toddler's book.

2451
03:01:07,590 --> 03:01:12,950
Or the fruitcake that's been old that I made that I got for a welcome present like a month ago.

2452
03:01:12,950 --> 03:01:16,340
Which one?

2453
03:01:16,340 --> 03:01:16,819
The apple.

2454
03:01:17,379 --> 03:01:19,479
Imagine getting an apple for a present.

2455
03:01:23,319 --> 03:01:24,600
Just one apple.

2456
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:26,790
A single apple.

2457
03:01:26,790 --> 03:01:30,200
Maybe the wooden toy.

2458
03:01:40,889 --> 03:01:41,450
Merry Christmas.

2459
03:01:42,729 --> 03:01:43,209
What's in it?

2460
03:01:44,969 --> 03:01:45,690
My specialty.

2461
03:01:48,950 --> 03:01:56,629
You know how much this fucking place is worth?

2462
03:01:57,979 --> 03:01:58,780
Where's a lot of money?

2463
03:01:58,780 --> 03:01:59,260
Out on the beach.

2464
03:02:07,399 --> 03:02:08,360
Ask what happened.

2465
03:02:09,819 --> 03:02:12,219
Can you turn the stove on or whatever?

2466
03:02:12,219 --> 03:02:15,899
Hey, Blark, you're so notorious that one of my unscrupulous friends has been asking to meet you.

2467
03:02:15,899 --> 03:02:16,860
Can I give them your number?

2468
03:02:16,860 --> 03:02:18,379
What do you mean notorious?

2469
03:02:18,379 --> 03:02:21,829
What does that mean?

2470
03:02:27,139 --> 03:02:27,379
No.

2471
03:02:30,170 --> 03:02:30,889
Oh, coffee.

2472
03:02:30,889 --> 03:02:31,610
Yep.

2473
03:02:31,610 --> 03:02:31,850
Okay.

2474
03:02:31,850 --> 03:02:34,090
We only have a couple hours till Santa shows up.

2475
03:02:34,090 --> 03:02:44,870
He's pissed.

2476
03:02:44,870 --> 03:02:50,940
Let's do, um, let's talk about who's laugh together.

2477
03:02:50,940 --> 03:02:52,139
Belly laugh.

2478
03:02:52,139 --> 03:02:59,000
Santa's going to show up very soon.

2479
03:03:08,840 --> 03:03:13,590
This dog looks like a sock puppet.

2480
03:03:18,549 --> 03:03:29,420
Okay, how about, um, how about, um, something just friendly.

2481
03:03:29,420 --> 03:03:29,899
New show.

2482
03:03:29,899 --> 03:03:30,780
There's a new show on TV.

2483
03:03:31,579 --> 03:03:32,219
Let's talk about the new show.

2484
03:03:33,420 --> 03:03:34,379
That makes sense, right?

2485
03:03:42,540 --> 03:03:43,020
All right.

2486
03:03:44,379 --> 03:03:45,340
All we drink is coffee.

2487
03:03:49,819 --> 03:03:51,020
I have to extinguish your fire.

2488
03:03:53,579 --> 03:03:53,989
Okay.

2489
03:03:55,610 --> 03:03:57,690
How about, um, complain about Winterfest.

2490
03:03:57,690 --> 03:03:58,409
I wouldn't want to know.

2491
03:03:58,409 --> 03:03:59,530
Why would I do that?

2492
03:03:59,530 --> 03:04:02,729
Having been a personal emergency and have to leave.

2493
03:04:02,729 --> 03:04:02,969
What?

2494
03:04:04,549 --> 03:04:05,030
What is it?

2495
03:04:05,030 --> 03:04:05,829
Emergency?

2496
03:04:19,159 --> 03:04:19,479
What?

2497
03:04:20,040 --> 03:04:21,670
Hey, I've heard a lot about you.

2498
03:04:21,670 --> 03:04:22,870
Mostly bad things, but that's okay.

2499
03:04:22,870 --> 03:04:24,549
People usually don't like me either.

2500
03:04:24,549 --> 03:04:25,750
We should hang out sometime.

2501
03:04:26,389 --> 03:04:31,909
Want to come over for Christmas?

2502
03:04:31,909 --> 03:04:42,149
Who was that?

2503
03:04:42,149 --> 03:04:44,870
Who was that?

2504
03:04:53,690 --> 03:04:55,129
Santa's going to show up in two hours.

2505
03:04:55,129 --> 03:04:55,610
Come on over.

2506
03:05:02,200 --> 03:05:03,399
Grace will be right over.

2507
03:05:03,399 --> 03:05:04,040
All right.

2508
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:05,290
Quick.

2509
03:05:05,290 --> 03:05:06,170
I got to use the bathroom.

2510
03:05:06,170 --> 03:05:09,209
No, don't go to bed after inviting some drink coffee and go to the bathroom.

2511
03:05:10,010 --> 03:05:14,090
That was quick.

2512
03:05:14,090 --> 03:05:16,649
You didn't, I didn't invite you in.

2513
03:05:16,649 --> 03:05:17,610
We just walked in the house.

2514
03:05:19,129 --> 03:05:20,170
Oh my goodness.

2515
03:05:25,750 --> 03:05:30,870
How are you doing?

2516
03:05:30,870 --> 03:05:34,620
All right.

2517
03:05:34,620 --> 03:05:35,579
What about like mischief?

2518
03:05:37,239 --> 03:05:38,600
Incoming phone call.

2519
03:05:38,600 --> 03:05:41,370
Hey, blogger.

2520
03:05:41,370 --> 03:05:45,690
I've been thinking about getting to know Nina Caliente better as a friend.

2521
03:05:45,690 --> 03:05:47,510
Do you think the two of us should?

2522
03:05:47,510 --> 03:05:50,620
Why are you calling me?

2523
03:05:50,620 --> 03:05:52,139
Don't, don't ever call this number again.

2524
03:05:53,579 --> 03:05:54,360
All right.

2525
03:05:54,360 --> 03:05:56,200
Let's make a coffee and then we'll be ready for Santa.

2526
03:05:59,159 --> 03:06:03,750
Said anything.

2527
03:06:09,319 --> 03:06:10,120
This is weird.

2528
03:06:34,700 --> 03:06:39,290
Get out.

2529
03:06:39,290 --> 03:06:39,690
Get out.

2530
03:06:40,790 --> 03:06:41,190
Get out of here.

2531
03:06:41,190 --> 03:06:41,670
Get out.

2532
03:06:41,670 --> 03:06:43,180
Oh dear.

2533
03:06:43,180 --> 03:06:43,899
Get out of here.

2534
03:06:43,899 --> 03:06:55,540
Wait, Santa's gonna be here in an hour.

2535
03:06:55,540 --> 03:06:56,420
Where's Santa?

2536
03:06:56,420 --> 03:06:56,899
8 p.m.

2537
03:06:56,899 --> 03:06:57,299
Right?

2538
03:06:57,299 --> 03:06:57,979
Quick.

2539
03:06:57,979 --> 03:07:05,750
I gotta, I gotta go to sleep just for a minute.

2540
03:07:05,750 --> 03:07:06,149
Wait, wait, wait.

2541
03:07:06,149 --> 03:07:06,469
Don't leave.

2542
03:07:06,469 --> 03:07:06,950
Don't leave.

2543
03:07:06,950 --> 03:07:08,860
Just pick the shit up.

2544
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:26,809
She picked the shit up with her hand.

2545
03:07:26,809 --> 03:07:27,209
All right.

2546
03:07:27,209 --> 03:07:31,219
Santa's coming.

2547
03:07:31,219 --> 03:07:31,780
8 p.m.

2548
03:07:31,780 --> 03:07:37,690
Here it comes.

2549
03:07:37,690 --> 03:07:37,930
Okay.

2550
03:07:39,479 --> 03:07:40,520
Santa!

2551
03:07:40,520 --> 03:07:46,809
What's he putting down Santa?

2552
03:07:46,809 --> 03:07:46,969
Okay.

2553
03:07:46,969 --> 03:07:48,090
We got a present from Santa.

2554
03:07:53,020 --> 03:07:56,469
Put your, Santa is in the room.

2555
03:07:56,469 --> 03:07:57,270
Put your phone down.

2556
03:07:59,670 --> 03:08:01,190
He's putting tons of shit here.

2557
03:08:02,459 --> 03:08:03,340
Oh my goodness.

2558
03:08:06,409 --> 03:08:07,690
And all those motherfuckers left.

2559
03:08:09,139 --> 03:08:09,459
Eat them.

2560
03:08:12,010 --> 03:08:12,250
Okay.

2561
03:08:12,250 --> 03:08:12,649
Okay.

2562
03:08:12,649 --> 03:08:12,969
Okay.

2563
03:08:12,969 --> 03:08:13,290
Okay.

2564
03:08:13,290 --> 03:08:13,610
Hold on.

2565
03:08:21,270 --> 03:08:22,149
There's cheese pizza here.

2566
03:08:28,889 --> 03:08:29,450
Okay.

2567
03:08:29,450 --> 03:08:30,489
Let's sing about Winterfest.

2568
03:08:38,969 --> 03:08:39,930
Wait, he got a gun.

2569
03:08:43,129 --> 03:08:46,809
Oh my God.

2570
03:08:46,809 --> 03:08:48,649
I thought he shot me in the face with a gun.

2571
03:08:49,930 --> 03:08:50,329
Oh my.

2572
03:08:52,969 --> 03:08:54,569
That was fucking crazy.

2573
03:08:55,610 --> 03:08:56,889
I, I thought I.

2574
03:08:56,889 --> 03:08:57,290
Okay.

2575
03:08:57,290 --> 03:08:58,090
We're good.

2576
03:08:58,090 --> 03:08:58,489
Pizza.

2577
03:09:04,180 --> 03:09:04,819
All right, Santa.

2578
03:09:04,819 --> 03:09:05,219
Stick around.

2579
03:09:07,899 --> 03:09:08,700
Let's get that pizza.

2580
03:09:17,399 --> 03:09:18,440
Why does this keep happening?

2581
03:09:23,700 --> 03:09:24,659
The door is locked?

2582
03:09:25,219 --> 03:09:26,979
People have been walking in and out of this door.

2583
03:09:35,989 --> 03:09:37,590
Hector Laurent is not here.

2584
03:09:38,229 --> 03:09:38,629
Is he?

2585
03:09:40,260 --> 03:09:40,739
Where is he?

2586
03:09:40,739 --> 03:09:52,600
He's hiding somewhere?

2587
03:09:52,600 --> 03:09:53,799
Santa, can you get the pizza?

2588
03:10:22,569 --> 03:10:23,690
This is fucked.

2589
03:10:23,690 --> 03:10:24,569
This is fucked up.

2590
03:10:29,510 --> 03:10:30,950
This is like creepy.

2591
03:10:30,950 --> 03:10:32,309
This is creepy.

2592
03:10:32,309 --> 03:10:33,430
It's actually kind of scary.

2593
03:10:35,110 --> 03:10:39,690
We can't get the pizza again.

2594
03:10:39,690 --> 03:10:40,729
He's going to leave it on the ground

2595
03:10:40,729 --> 03:10:42,569
and Santa's going to take it and then leave.

2596
03:10:42,569 --> 03:10:46,149
And then I can, I'm going to go back to work tomorrow.

2597
03:10:46,149 --> 03:10:47,590
This nightmare can finally end.

2598
03:10:48,309 --> 03:10:49,780
But there are presents in here.

2599
03:10:50,420 --> 03:10:57,180
Come open presents.

2600
03:10:57,899 --> 03:10:58,379
What did I get?

2601
03:11:01,799 --> 03:11:02,760
Santa put these in here.

2602
03:11:05,379 --> 03:11:07,139
Plus one wonder game.

2603
03:11:07,139 --> 03:11:08,500
Ooh, cool.

2604
03:11:08,500 --> 03:11:09,620
That's it.

2605
03:11:09,940 --> 03:11:10,659
Oh, that was rude.

2606
03:11:11,530 --> 03:11:12,250
That was rude.

2607
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:13,209
What I meant to say was

2608
03:11:13,209 --> 03:11:15,530
thank you so much, Santa, for the gift.

2609
03:11:15,530 --> 03:11:17,690
I can't get the pizza.

2610
03:11:18,739 --> 03:11:20,020
I can't get the pizza.

2611
03:11:20,819 --> 03:11:23,059
I'm locked inside of my house, apparently.

2612
03:11:25,350 --> 03:11:25,829
I can't.

2613
03:11:32,549 --> 03:11:33,829
He's complaining about the trash.

2614
03:11:33,829 --> 03:11:34,629
He just put it there.

2615
03:11:35,909 --> 03:11:37,190
Well, let me go ahead and get the pizza now.

2616
03:11:44,780 --> 03:11:46,219
You know what?

2617
03:11:46,219 --> 03:11:47,020
I'm insulting you.

2618
03:11:48,379 --> 03:11:50,139
Come back here so I can insult you.

2619
03:11:50,139 --> 03:11:57,590
You going to get a slice?

2620
03:11:57,590 --> 03:11:58,229
I'm going to bed.

2621
03:12:01,989 --> 03:12:04,260
I give you a Winterfest gift.

2622
03:12:04,260 --> 03:12:05,459
A fresh coffee.

2623
03:12:18,620 --> 03:12:20,889
There's an alien.

2624
03:12:20,889 --> 03:12:26,629
Why did I play the alien song?

2625
03:12:26,629 --> 03:12:32,420
All right, put this away.

2626
03:12:32,420 --> 03:12:33,139
Put it in the fridge.

2627
03:12:33,139 --> 03:12:34,819
Because can we?

2628
03:12:34,819 --> 03:12:35,780
Okay, can I finally?

2629
03:12:38,010 --> 03:12:39,670
All right, we're good.

2630
03:12:39,670 --> 03:12:40,549
Everybody can relax.

2631
03:12:41,270 --> 03:12:43,590
That was strange.

2632
03:12:45,829 --> 03:12:52,969
But it's time to get back to the real life here.

2633
03:12:52,969 --> 03:12:54,250
Winterfest was really fun.

2634
03:12:54,969 --> 03:12:56,010
I got some cool stuff.

2635
03:12:57,610 --> 03:12:59,850
Um, we're going to let's clean up.

2636
03:13:01,049 --> 03:13:01,690
Feed the dog.

2637
03:13:02,409 --> 03:13:02,969
Take a bath.

2638
03:13:03,899 --> 03:13:04,940
Clean this place up.

2639
03:13:04,940 --> 03:13:10,090
Everything looks okay.

2640
03:13:10,969 --> 03:13:12,899
All right.

2641
03:13:12,899 --> 03:13:14,819
Well, I don't know where you're going, but whatever.

2642
03:13:14,819 --> 03:13:16,020
Host another party.

2643
03:13:16,020 --> 03:13:21,510
No, not another party.

2644
03:13:21,510 --> 03:13:22,709
I need to rest.

2645
03:13:22,709 --> 03:13:24,950
And then I got to get up because I have work.

2646
03:13:24,950 --> 03:13:29,739
I got work tomorrow.

2647
03:13:29,739 --> 03:13:33,670
Work starts in this morning and relax.

2648
03:13:33,670 --> 03:13:39,819
I think your door porch is not big enough for two people.

2649
03:13:39,819 --> 03:13:42,739
Is that what the problem is?

2650
03:13:42,739 --> 03:13:50,020
The dude put the trash on the ground and then complained that I had like a dirty house.

2651
03:13:50,260 --> 03:13:53,620
Dude, you that's what's going on.

2652
03:13:53,620 --> 03:14:13,239
Need to make it bigger.

2653
03:14:13,239 --> 03:14:17,879
Should I just get rid of it and put hold on?

2654
03:14:17,879 --> 03:14:20,540
What if I make like a little like, yeah, okay.

2655
03:14:20,540 --> 03:14:21,420
This is what I'm going to do.

2656
03:14:21,420 --> 03:14:25,340
I'm going to build out the wall here.

2657
03:14:25,340 --> 03:14:26,139
I have a thousand bucks.

2658
03:14:26,139 --> 03:14:27,180
I think I have enough to do it.

2659
03:14:27,180 --> 03:14:32,620
Just like a little thing, right?

2660
03:14:32,620 --> 03:14:47,370
How do I make just like a little thingy?

2661
03:14:47,370 --> 03:14:48,010
Make a pool?

2662
03:14:48,010 --> 03:14:48,809
Build a deck?

2663
03:14:48,809 --> 03:14:50,090
I don't have enough money.

2664
03:14:50,090 --> 03:14:52,489
Platform.

2665
03:14:52,489 --> 03:14:58,440
Okay, so I'm going to do rounded platform.

2666
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:11,000
This doesn't look right.

2667
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:12,870
This is not right.

2668
03:15:12,870 --> 03:15:15,530
This is wrong.

2669
03:15:15,530 --> 03:15:16,170
Bottom right.

2670
03:15:19,290 --> 03:15:20,569
How do I remove this?

2671
03:15:20,569 --> 03:15:25,430
Okay, so square deck.

2672
03:15:25,430 --> 03:15:28,139
But this is a big cube.

2673
03:15:28,860 --> 03:15:38,309
I don't understand.

2674
03:15:39,110 --> 03:15:46,969
Oh, that's wrong.

2675
03:15:48,329 --> 03:15:50,309
Why is this so fucked up?

2676
03:15:50,309 --> 03:15:52,780
Did I skip to the fridge?

2677
03:15:52,780 --> 03:15:54,139
Wait, why is a fridge in here?

2678
03:15:54,780 --> 03:15:55,780
How do I undo?

2679
03:16:00,010 --> 03:16:00,569
Controls it.

2680
03:16:01,209 --> 03:16:01,610
I can't.

2681
03:16:02,950 --> 03:16:04,149
It's like going into the house.

2682
03:16:04,870 --> 03:16:19,370
Is the movement that cheat that I turned on screwing this up?

2683
03:16:35,559 --> 03:16:36,120
Oh my God.

2684
03:16:36,120 --> 03:16:36,680
Don't do that.

2685
03:16:38,979 --> 03:16:39,219
Wait.

2686
03:16:40,489 --> 03:16:41,129
Yeah, do that.

2687
03:16:58,200 --> 03:16:59,079
Oh my God.

2688
03:16:59,079 --> 03:17:03,639
Okay, I actually have a house now.

2689
03:17:04,280 --> 03:17:05,239
Oh my goodness.

2690
03:17:07,079 --> 03:17:07,639
Thank God.

2691
03:17:08,200 --> 03:17:10,889
I don't know why I was up so high.

2692
03:17:10,889 --> 03:17:13,899
All right, so now I got to make an opening here.

2693
03:17:14,459 --> 03:17:17,129
A little gate.

2694
03:17:17,129 --> 03:17:36,379
How do I put a gate so they can walk in?

2695
03:17:36,379 --> 03:17:50,500
It's kind of big.

2696
03:17:51,059 --> 03:18:00,409
Okay, I want brick.

2697
03:18:00,409 --> 03:18:02,739
There we are.

2698
03:18:02,739 --> 03:18:10,700
Hey, look at that.

2699
03:18:10,700 --> 03:18:12,709
Okay, nice.

2700
03:18:13,590 --> 03:18:15,030
Oh my God.

2701
03:18:15,030 --> 03:18:17,420
Okay, hold on here.

2702
03:18:18,139 --> 03:18:32,170
Looks good.

2703
03:18:32,170 --> 03:18:36,739
All right, now I actually am not up in the air.

2704
03:18:36,739 --> 03:18:38,809
I have a little area out here.

2705
03:18:38,809 --> 03:18:40,090
I can put like some plants and shit.

2706
03:18:40,090 --> 03:18:43,129
All right, now it's time to get back to reality.

2707
03:18:43,129 --> 03:18:44,069
Hey.

2708
03:18:44,069 --> 03:18:49,079
Things looking good.

2709
03:18:50,840 --> 03:18:52,040
I'm blocking the Winterfest stuff.

2710
03:18:52,040 --> 03:18:53,879
Yeah, but it's over.

2711
03:18:53,879 --> 03:18:54,920
I did everything.

2712
03:18:54,920 --> 03:19:00,520
Some sleep.

2713
03:19:00,520 --> 03:19:03,940
Go to the bathroom, get some sleep, and then take a shower.

2714
03:19:03,940 --> 03:19:10,809
What the hell is that?

2715
03:19:10,809 --> 03:19:17,299
All right, sleep, get up, have a quick breakfast, and then get to work.

2716
03:19:17,299 --> 03:19:20,329
I need a computer eventually.

2717
03:19:20,329 --> 03:19:22,090
After I get back from work, I'm going to get a computer

2718
03:19:22,090 --> 03:19:28,469
because I have some secret agent.

2719
03:19:32,200 --> 03:19:33,239
I got to get this.

2720
03:19:33,239 --> 03:19:34,360
This is way too goopy.

2721
03:19:34,360 --> 03:19:36,659
It was weird.

2722
03:19:36,659 --> 03:19:37,620
This is super goopy.

2723
03:19:37,620 --> 03:19:39,299
It's spreading too much.

2724
03:19:39,299 --> 03:19:42,500
This is goopy.

2725
03:19:44,389 --> 03:19:45,030
Oh my God.

2726
03:19:45,030 --> 03:19:45,430
Why is it?

2727
03:19:51,100 --> 03:19:51,739
That one's goopy.

2728
03:19:51,739 --> 03:19:52,299
I don't like that one.

2729
03:19:53,739 --> 03:19:55,260
Winterfest was, what did it say?

2730
03:19:55,260 --> 03:19:56,459
Winterfest was pretty good.

2731
03:19:56,459 --> 03:19:59,100
Laura got to do a lot of things he wanted to do, but not everything.

2732
03:19:59,100 --> 03:20:00,540
Next year, he hopes to do even more.

2733
03:20:03,319 --> 03:20:03,799
That's fine.

2734
03:20:03,799 --> 03:20:06,680
Okay, get some sleep.

2735
03:20:06,680 --> 03:20:11,610
You need to eat, and then I'm going to get to bed,

2736
03:20:11,610 --> 03:20:14,569
and I got to get up in five hours to go to work.

2737
03:20:14,569 --> 03:20:16,100
What's wrong with me?

2738
03:20:16,100 --> 03:20:18,379
Something was gross.

2739
03:20:21,750 --> 03:20:24,540
How do you upgrade the bed?

2740
03:20:25,909 --> 03:20:26,469
All right, let's go.

2741
03:20:27,590 --> 03:20:28,389
Geez.

2742
03:20:28,389 --> 03:20:37,350
We're good.

2743
03:20:37,350 --> 03:20:42,420
Starts in about an hour.

2744
03:20:42,420 --> 03:20:43,430
Should be fine.

2745
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:51,180
Late for work?

2746
03:20:51,180 --> 03:20:51,579
What do you mean?

2747
03:20:51,579 --> 03:20:52,219
What?

2748
03:20:52,219 --> 03:20:55,430
Did I just miss work?

2749
03:20:55,430 --> 03:21:00,700
Who's calling me?

2750
03:21:00,700 --> 03:21:04,309
Laura, thank you for suggesting I hang out with Nina Caliente.

2751
03:21:04,309 --> 03:21:05,670
We had a spectacular time.

2752
03:21:05,670 --> 03:21:06,870
I literally hung up on you.

2753
03:21:06,870 --> 03:21:07,750
I hung up on that guy.

2754
03:21:08,309 --> 03:21:12,120
Okay, we're good.

2755
03:21:12,120 --> 03:21:19,000
That person made that up.

2756
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:19,719
Uncomfortable.

2757
03:21:20,520 --> 03:21:21,479
Too many Sims.

2758
03:21:24,969 --> 03:21:26,149
Is there coffee brewing?

2759
03:21:27,030 --> 03:21:28,229
All right, 123 bucks.

2760
03:21:29,620 --> 03:21:30,819
Clean up the coffee maker.

2761
03:21:32,180 --> 03:21:35,139
Take a shower, and then I need to get a computer,

2762
03:21:35,139 --> 03:21:37,379
and I need to do this, whatever the skill is.

2763
03:21:37,379 --> 03:21:38,739
Browse intelligence.

2764
03:21:38,739 --> 03:21:39,860
And I'm ready for promotion.

2765
03:21:39,860 --> 03:21:44,659
Look at this.

2766
03:21:44,659 --> 03:21:45,139
Oh, hello.

2767
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:53,590
Bathroom shower.

2768
03:21:53,590 --> 03:21:56,389
Now, I need a little desk and a computer.

2769
03:21:56,389 --> 03:21:58,120
Can I afford it?

2770
03:22:06,899 --> 03:22:08,500
Oh, why do I have a slice of pizza?

2771
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:09,620
And what inventory?

2772
03:22:11,110 --> 03:22:14,409
Made by Titus Peterson.

2773
03:22:14,409 --> 03:22:21,510
Who is that?

2774
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:34,229
Okay, let's go with the

2775
03:22:35,450 --> 03:22:37,209
needed desk right here.

2776
03:22:37,209 --> 03:22:38,229
Just a shitty one.

2777
03:22:38,229 --> 03:22:40,149
Just little ones so I can use the computer.

2778
03:22:40,149 --> 03:22:41,879
It's the cheapest one they have.

2779
03:22:44,069 --> 03:22:45,110
Oh, my God.

2780
03:22:45,909 --> 03:22:47,590
It's like a half-life item.

2781
03:22:47,590 --> 03:22:49,030
All right, that's fine.

2782
03:22:56,020 --> 03:22:56,739
And here we are.

2783
03:22:57,899 --> 03:22:58,940
Desktop computer.

2784
03:22:59,579 --> 03:23:03,690
I only have 100 bucks and I need a seat.

2785
03:23:04,250 --> 03:23:12,899
I don't think I can afford a nice chair to dry though.

2786
03:23:12,899 --> 03:23:18,120
Okay, that's fine.

2787
03:23:18,120 --> 03:23:22,309
All right, now I'm gonna take a quick shower,

2788
03:23:22,309 --> 03:23:25,639
and I'm gonna do the whatever this is.

2789
03:23:25,639 --> 03:23:27,479
I need to practice intelligence.

2790
03:23:27,479 --> 03:23:41,750
Take a shower.

2791
03:23:41,750 --> 03:23:43,270
You seem pretty happy.

2792
03:23:43,270 --> 03:23:46,569
All right, hunger.

2793
03:23:46,569 --> 03:23:49,370
I'll eat something quick.

2794
03:23:49,370 --> 03:23:53,299
Wait, I have pizza in the fridge, right?

2795
03:23:53,299 --> 03:24:01,100
Leftovers.

2796
03:24:01,100 --> 03:24:02,780
Something smells.

2797
03:24:02,780 --> 03:24:05,739
This fridge is steaming with smelly stuff.

2798
03:24:05,739 --> 03:24:08,059
What is it?

2799
03:24:08,700 --> 03:24:09,579
Can I look in the fridge?

2800
03:24:10,440 --> 03:24:15,420
I'm not eating the problem, right?

2801
03:24:15,420 --> 03:24:17,100
Clean out spoiled food.

2802
03:24:17,100 --> 03:24:29,139
Oh, God, it's fine.

2803
03:24:29,780 --> 03:24:33,260
Okay, better.

2804
03:24:34,409 --> 03:24:36,250
Now it's time.

2805
03:24:36,250 --> 03:24:43,399
Computer security settings.

2806
03:24:43,399 --> 03:24:43,879
Career.

2807
03:24:47,430 --> 03:24:48,389
Practice, where is it?

2808
03:24:50,329 --> 03:24:50,969
Play game.

2809
03:24:50,969 --> 03:24:52,010
Vampire secrets.

2810
03:24:53,420 --> 03:24:53,899
Where is it?

2811
03:24:57,459 --> 03:24:57,780
Web?

2812
03:25:00,010 --> 03:25:01,610
Okay, browse the intelligence database.

2813
03:25:01,610 --> 03:25:02,250
There it is.

2814
03:25:02,250 --> 03:25:06,809
I'm getting a call from Santa Claus.

2815
03:25:06,809 --> 03:25:11,049
Hey, blogger, I think I have a crush on Lilith Vator.

2816
03:25:11,049 --> 03:25:12,170
Do you think it's worth a try?

2817
03:25:20,409 --> 03:25:20,809
I don't know.

2818
03:25:20,809 --> 03:25:21,129
Sure.

2819
03:25:21,129 --> 03:25:21,770
I don't know.

2820
03:25:21,770 --> 03:25:22,489
Why are you calling me?

2821
03:25:25,340 --> 03:25:26,379
All right, I gotta do this.

2822
03:25:26,379 --> 03:25:27,020
All right.

2823
03:25:27,020 --> 03:25:33,819
Just started.

2824
03:25:33,819 --> 03:25:34,540
What is he saying?

2825
03:25:36,059 --> 03:25:36,540
Does he want...

2826
03:25:37,340 --> 03:25:37,979
What do you want?

2827
03:25:37,979 --> 03:25:38,540
What does he want?

2828
03:25:38,540 --> 03:25:39,819
You love another dog?

2829
03:25:39,819 --> 03:25:40,459
What was that?

2830
03:25:40,459 --> 03:25:43,180
What does that mean?

2831
03:25:43,180 --> 03:25:56,379
I'll give you a bath in a second.

2832
03:25:56,379 --> 03:25:57,340
25% done.

2833
03:25:57,340 --> 03:25:57,659
Hold on.

2834
03:26:06,469 --> 03:26:09,030
Ooh, possible lead.

2835
03:26:09,030 --> 03:26:11,819
The discovery of some uncovered intelligence

2836
03:26:11,819 --> 03:26:14,649
may help make the next day of work a bit easier.

2837
03:26:14,649 --> 03:26:15,209
All right.

2838
03:26:15,209 --> 03:26:16,649
I'm in a good mood right now.

2839
03:26:16,649 --> 03:26:19,260
That's cool.

2840
03:26:19,260 --> 03:26:24,459
100% done, right?

2841
03:26:24,459 --> 03:26:26,700
And get to bed early so you get promotion.

2842
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:33,350
I'm gonna give the dog a bath.

2843
03:26:33,350 --> 03:26:36,649
Don't go to bed yet.

2844
03:26:36,649 --> 03:26:37,049
Not yet.

2845
03:26:37,770 --> 03:26:42,729
All right, we're gonna play fetch

2846
03:26:42,729 --> 03:26:43,610
and then I'm gonna give you a bath.

2847
03:26:46,870 --> 03:26:48,120
He's so dirty.

2848
03:26:51,799 --> 03:26:52,840
Pet training skill.

2849
03:26:52,840 --> 03:26:53,799
Jujube?

2850
03:26:53,799 --> 03:26:55,239
Do they even train dogs?

2851
03:26:59,190 --> 03:27:00,389
Dodo is a smart dog.

2852
03:27:02,090 --> 03:27:03,770
They're easy to train and learn quickly.

2853
03:27:05,940 --> 03:27:06,260
Really?

2854
03:27:14,920 --> 03:27:15,959
What do you want?

2855
03:27:15,959 --> 03:27:17,000
Play fetch?

2856
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:17,719
Let's play fetch.

2857
03:27:23,219 --> 03:27:23,540
There it is.

2858
03:27:28,729 --> 03:27:29,850
Are they flies?

2859
03:27:33,079 --> 03:27:33,739
Go get it.

2860
03:27:34,299 --> 03:27:37,049
You gotta pick it up.

2861
03:27:37,049 --> 03:27:40,889
Take a look.

2862
03:27:43,879 --> 03:27:44,360
Champy?

2863
03:27:45,159 --> 03:27:47,190
Oh, you got it.

2864
03:27:49,180 --> 03:27:49,579
Nice.

2865
03:27:49,579 --> 03:27:50,219
Excellent dog.

2866
03:27:50,860 --> 03:27:54,149
I'm gonna give you a big treat for that one.

2867
03:27:55,700 --> 03:27:56,180
Jujube?

2868
03:27:56,180 --> 03:27:56,579
I'll spot.

2869
03:27:59,860 --> 03:28:01,590
Get it.

2870
03:28:01,590 --> 03:28:02,389
Here's a big treat.

2871
03:28:05,750 --> 03:28:11,860
Who's this?

2872
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:12,340
Loretta?

2873
03:28:13,219 --> 03:28:13,620
Warrant?

2874
03:28:16,739 --> 03:28:17,940
Is this a public beach?

2875
03:28:23,690 --> 03:28:25,370
Am I on a public beach?

2876
03:28:29,979 --> 03:28:31,180
Because people are just kind of...

2877
03:28:31,180 --> 03:28:32,860
This is not my private land.

2878
03:28:34,100 --> 03:28:35,780
I don't get like this section of the beach.

2879
03:28:36,340 --> 03:28:37,850
How does that work?

2880
03:28:37,850 --> 03:28:40,870
How does it work if this is my house?

2881
03:28:40,870 --> 03:28:43,030
Do I own this part of the water?

2882
03:28:43,030 --> 03:28:44,299
I don't know how this works.

2883
03:28:44,299 --> 03:28:45,979
I don't know how beach front property works.

2884
03:28:50,059 --> 03:28:51,260
Gate this beach off.

2885
03:28:52,520 --> 03:28:54,440
Just put a whole gate here.

2886
03:28:54,440 --> 03:28:58,200
So you just went swimming.

2887
03:29:01,190 --> 03:29:03,620
I need to put a gate here.

2888
03:29:03,620 --> 03:29:04,579
Watch the dog.

2889
03:29:04,579 --> 03:29:05,700
I keep trying to.

2890
03:29:11,379 --> 03:29:12,819
Okay, go to learn how to fetch.

2891
03:29:12,819 --> 03:29:16,059
Nice job.

2892
03:29:16,059 --> 03:29:17,020
Give the dog bath.

2893
03:29:19,290 --> 03:29:20,409
All right, come on, let's go.

2894
03:29:20,409 --> 03:29:26,600
It's not your beach.

2895
03:29:26,600 --> 03:29:35,510
All right, there we go.

2896
03:29:42,649 --> 03:29:43,690
Dog's being very calm.

2897
03:29:46,309 --> 03:29:47,190
Such a good dog.

2898
03:29:50,069 --> 03:29:51,110
I need energy.

2899
03:29:51,110 --> 03:29:52,549
All right, smelly pet.

2900
03:29:52,549 --> 03:29:54,379
Let's take care of that.

2901
03:29:58,379 --> 03:29:59,659
Get an auto feeder.

2902
03:30:00,620 --> 03:30:01,579
Actually, that's a good idea.

2903
03:30:03,370 --> 03:30:04,649
But I need to save some money.

2904
03:30:11,209 --> 03:30:12,889
All right, time for bed.

2905
03:30:12,889 --> 03:30:13,450
Get up.

2906
03:30:13,450 --> 03:30:15,530
I have my job completed.

2907
03:30:15,530 --> 03:30:19,399
Get some sleep.

2908
03:30:19,399 --> 03:30:23,399
All right, let's go.

2909
03:30:23,399 --> 03:30:24,280
Good day.

2910
03:30:24,280 --> 03:30:30,360
Why is my neck so white?

2911
03:30:30,360 --> 03:30:32,139
Because the way that my...

2912
03:30:32,139 --> 03:30:33,659
I don't know, the way that my camera's lighting.

2913
03:30:33,659 --> 03:30:34,299
I don't have...

2914
03:30:34,299 --> 03:30:34,700
I'm not...

2915
03:30:34,700 --> 03:30:34,940
I don't...

2916
03:30:35,739 --> 03:30:42,219
I want to have a night on the town.

2917
03:30:42,860 --> 03:30:48,729
Local businesses want to show some customer appreciation

2918
03:30:48,729 --> 03:30:50,329
by offering free food and drinks.

2919
03:30:50,329 --> 03:30:51,850
Time to get out of the house and visit a venue.

2920
03:30:52,489 --> 03:30:56,809
All right, so after work, I'll go do it.

2921
03:30:56,809 --> 03:30:58,540
I'm in a bad mood.

2922
03:30:58,540 --> 03:31:01,350
Oh, here's another hack thing.

2923
03:31:01,350 --> 03:31:01,989
Yeah, hack it.

2924
03:31:02,709 --> 03:31:05,270
You just can't beat this one.

2925
03:31:05,270 --> 03:31:09,129
Finally, Blorg has to admit defeat to his boss.

2926
03:31:09,129 --> 03:31:11,129
And turns out he just had the wrong password.

2927
03:31:11,129 --> 03:31:16,459
His boss is not amused.

2928
03:31:16,459 --> 03:31:17,100
Really?

2929
03:31:17,100 --> 03:31:19,020
What did I...

2930
03:31:19,020 --> 03:31:23,079
I ate something at work.

2931
03:31:23,079 --> 03:31:24,680
New Year's Eve is tomorrow.

2932
03:31:24,680 --> 03:31:33,479
No, I'm going out for New Year's Eve.

2933
03:31:33,479 --> 03:31:34,120
I'm going out.

2934
03:31:34,120 --> 03:31:34,920
I'm not staying in.

2935
03:31:34,920 --> 03:31:36,040
I'm not putting a...

2936
03:31:36,040 --> 03:31:36,840
No, I'm going out.

2937
03:31:37,479 --> 03:31:47,379
I'm not throwing a New Year's Eve party.

2938
03:31:47,379 --> 03:31:51,719
I keep getting calls from Santa again.

2939
03:31:51,719 --> 03:31:53,559
Remember when we talked about Lilith Vitora?

2940
03:31:53,559 --> 03:31:55,000
We went on a very nice date.

2941
03:31:55,559 --> 03:31:57,159
Congratulations, Santa.

2942
03:31:57,159 --> 03:31:57,799
I hope it went well.

2943
03:32:03,219 --> 03:32:04,600
Promotion.

2944
03:32:05,239 --> 03:32:07,399
Promoted to intelligence researcher.

2945
03:32:07,399 --> 03:32:14,440
He doesn't like this career.

2946
03:32:14,440 --> 03:32:18,379
How long has it been?

2947
03:32:18,379 --> 03:32:20,540
Blorg can't help but wonder if this is the career right for him.

2948
03:32:20,540 --> 03:32:21,260
One thing is for sure.

2949
03:32:21,260 --> 03:32:22,940
There needs to be some kind of change.

2950
03:32:22,940 --> 03:32:28,229
I just got promoted.

2951
03:32:28,229 --> 03:32:30,469
Oh my God, I forgot to go to Star Wars Land.

2952
03:32:30,469 --> 03:32:31,270
I completely forgot.

2953
03:32:31,270 --> 03:32:32,950
I'm going to Star Wars Land for New Year's Eve.

2954
03:32:32,950 --> 03:32:34,870
That's what I'm doing for my New Year's Eve party.

2955
03:32:34,870 --> 03:32:38,520
Where am I?

2956
03:32:38,520 --> 03:32:39,399
Right there I am.

2957
03:32:39,399 --> 03:32:42,620
That's a great idea.

2958
03:32:45,639 --> 03:33:00,139
That's genuinely a good idea.

2959
03:33:00,139 --> 03:33:00,940
It sucks, by the way.

2960
03:33:00,940 --> 03:33:01,819
It's the worst DLC.

2961
03:33:02,459 --> 03:33:04,979
Well, we're only going to go for like a few minutes.

2962
03:33:04,979 --> 03:33:05,860
Not for long.

2963
03:33:05,860 --> 03:33:10,280
Where'd the dog go?

2964
03:33:10,840 --> 03:33:13,049
We're going to clean that up.

2965
03:33:16,469 --> 03:33:17,190
I'm going to throw it away.

2966
03:33:17,190 --> 03:33:17,670
Don't pick it up.

2967
03:33:17,670 --> 03:33:17,909
I don't...

2968
03:33:17,909 --> 03:33:18,629
Do I have...

2969
03:33:18,629 --> 03:33:19,989
Do I have a trash barrel?

2970
03:33:24,629 --> 03:33:25,590
You have to throw...

2971
03:33:25,590 --> 03:33:27,989
I haven't gotten the mail the whole time of the plan.

2972
03:33:27,989 --> 03:33:31,290
Don't you need a trash barrel for outside?

2973
03:33:36,229 --> 03:33:37,110
Oh my goodness.

2974
03:33:41,350 --> 03:33:43,670
$220 for that?

2975
03:33:45,530 --> 03:33:46,010
You gotta be...

2976
03:33:46,010 --> 03:33:46,889
Where's my mailbox?

2977
03:33:52,040 --> 03:33:53,159
Auto-sell.

2978
03:33:53,159 --> 03:33:53,959
Lot.

2979
03:33:53,959 --> 03:33:54,280
Total.

2980
03:33:54,280 --> 03:33:55,799
I have 400 bucks that I owe.

2981
03:33:55,799 --> 03:34:00,340
How much money do I owe?

2982
03:34:00,340 --> 03:34:00,579
What?

2983
03:34:01,299 --> 03:34:03,909
Whatever.

2984
03:34:03,909 --> 03:34:04,549
I'm just not going to pay it.

2985
03:34:08,250 --> 03:34:09,290
Ask for autograph?

2986
03:34:17,110 --> 03:34:17,430
Ooh.

2987
03:34:17,430 --> 03:34:17,670
All right.

2988
03:34:17,670 --> 03:34:18,549
What's my goal?

2989
03:34:19,110 --> 03:34:21,750
I need level two logic skill.

2990
03:34:22,309 --> 03:34:26,149
What am I doing?

2991
03:34:26,149 --> 03:34:45,370
Does programming do logic?

2992
03:34:51,610 --> 03:34:53,049
No, it's programming.

2993
03:34:53,049 --> 03:34:54,569
I probably need programming, though.

2994
03:35:00,649 --> 03:35:01,690
I definitely need programming.

2995
03:35:07,420 --> 03:35:08,620
I mean, I'm a secret agent.

2996
03:35:13,739 --> 03:35:15,420
So is this Night on the Town?

2997
03:35:15,420 --> 03:35:16,299
Is this what I want to do now?

2998
03:35:18,260 --> 03:35:20,100
Okay, so Night on the Town is what I can do today.

2999
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:21,780
But I'm just going to wait for New Year's Eve.

3000
03:35:22,420 --> 03:35:26,579
Because that is a night on the town, technically.

3001
03:35:27,139 --> 03:35:29,819
Yeah, I'll do that.

3002
03:35:29,819 --> 03:35:30,379
I'll wait for that.

3003
03:35:31,340 --> 03:35:32,299
New Year's Eve.

3004
03:35:32,299 --> 03:35:37,399
Oh, there's a talent showcase going down at the lounge.

3005
03:35:37,399 --> 03:35:38,920
Let's go embarrass ourselves.

3006
03:35:38,920 --> 03:35:45,260
Um, who is this?

3007
03:35:55,379 --> 03:35:56,420
I don't even know who this is.

3008
03:36:10,780 --> 03:36:12,139
They all got here at the same time.

3009
03:36:13,180 --> 03:36:13,819
This is loud.

3010
03:36:13,819 --> 03:36:14,940
I could turn it down.

3011
03:36:14,940 --> 03:36:20,459
It's really loud.

3012
03:36:22,860 --> 03:36:25,450
Okay, so it's a talent show.

3013
03:36:25,610 --> 03:36:26,569
Do I have any talents?

3014
03:36:27,129 --> 03:36:32,579
Well, this is a huge pool.

3015
03:36:35,479 --> 03:36:36,360
Skinny Dip?

3016
03:36:37,000 --> 03:36:37,639
Together?

3017
03:36:40,059 --> 03:36:40,540
With who?

3018
03:36:41,180 --> 03:36:42,780
Do I pick who goes skinny dipping?

3019
03:36:44,469 --> 03:36:45,510
Why does it say together?

3020
03:36:57,379 --> 03:36:59,620
Wait, wait, you're doing it too?

3021
03:37:00,500 --> 03:37:01,620
Okay, I didn't know.

3022
03:37:01,620 --> 03:37:03,059
I thought I was going to have to select people.

3023
03:37:14,059 --> 03:37:15,500
All right, that...

3024
03:37:19,590 --> 03:37:25,639
I didn't know what I thought I was going to select.

3025
03:37:25,639 --> 03:37:27,159
Okay, where's the mic?

3026
03:37:27,159 --> 03:37:32,120
Oh, it's right here.

3027
03:37:32,120 --> 03:37:33,079
Let's sing a duet.

3028
03:37:33,079 --> 03:37:35,719
Let's sing a country duet.

3029
03:37:38,090 --> 03:37:39,129
Me and Hillary.

3030
03:37:39,129 --> 03:37:48,790
No, I don't want to talk to that person.

3031
03:37:48,790 --> 03:37:49,670
I'm going to do a country duet.

3032
03:37:50,860 --> 03:37:52,299
We're going to drown each other out here.

3033
03:37:57,020 --> 03:37:58,059
Who gets all the screen time?

3034
03:37:58,059 --> 03:37:58,459
Let's see.

3035
03:38:18,940 --> 03:38:20,940
Come into the party, dog.

3036
03:38:20,940 --> 03:38:21,899
Get away from the entrance.

3037
03:38:25,030 --> 03:38:25,989
Oh, my.

3038
03:38:25,989 --> 03:38:26,870
We are...

3039
03:38:26,870 --> 03:38:28,360
We're like...

3040
03:38:28,360 --> 03:38:29,159
How high are we?

3041
03:38:31,129 --> 03:38:31,850
Holy mon...

3042
03:38:33,079 --> 03:38:34,200
Oh, okay.

3043
03:38:36,520 --> 03:38:37,239
That's high up.

3044
03:38:38,120 --> 03:38:39,399
I've played this before.

3045
03:38:39,399 --> 03:38:40,120
Yeah, I have.

3046
03:38:41,959 --> 03:38:44,069
I remember I had a wedding here.

3047
03:38:46,229 --> 03:38:48,790
And then people just started to attack each other.

3048
03:38:48,790 --> 03:38:49,510
From what I remember.

3049
03:38:55,059 --> 03:38:58,180
All right, we're going to go to Batuu.

3050
03:39:02,149 --> 03:39:03,190
That was fun.

3051
03:39:03,190 --> 03:39:03,690
Good night.

3052
03:39:09,270 --> 03:39:11,110
Am I going to selfie in the middle of your performance?

3053
03:39:12,840 --> 03:39:13,340
Yeah.

3054
03:39:37,899 --> 03:39:39,020
That just ruined her set.

3055
03:39:43,100 --> 03:39:44,379
Did people pay to see this?

3056
03:39:50,700 --> 03:40:12,629
Okay, it's time to go to Batuu.

3057
03:40:14,389 --> 03:40:15,110
I'm tired.

3058
03:40:15,110 --> 03:40:17,350
I need to go to work, but I'm not going to work tomorrow.

3059
03:40:17,350 --> 03:40:19,670
I'm going to Batuu tomorrow, and I'm going to become a Jedi.

3060
03:40:19,750 --> 03:40:25,000
My thing says I'm asleep.

3061
03:40:26,520 --> 03:40:27,020
What?

3062
03:40:32,059 --> 03:40:33,180
This guy is a weirdo.

3063
03:40:42,090 --> 03:40:43,610
Am I going to get a full night's sleep here?

3064
03:41:04,549 --> 03:41:05,590
All right, I got a night's sleep.

3065
03:41:08,219 --> 03:41:09,180
That was fun.

3066
03:41:09,180 --> 03:41:10,299
It's time to go to Batuu.

3067
03:41:18,409 --> 03:41:20,409
Wait, didn't I come with somebody?

3068
03:41:22,059 --> 03:41:23,100
I came here with someone.

3069
03:41:23,100 --> 03:41:24,059
Where's Hillary?

3070
03:41:28,659 --> 03:41:29,219
What's wrong?

3071
03:41:29,219 --> 03:41:31,079
What is it?

3072
03:41:31,079 --> 03:41:32,920
Oh, it's like a futuristic toilet or something.

3073
03:41:38,149 --> 03:41:38,870
Doesn't like it.

3074
03:41:38,870 --> 03:41:39,370
All right.

3075
03:41:42,040 --> 03:41:43,319
All right, it's time to go to Batuu.

3076
03:41:46,860 --> 03:41:47,899
Rest up.

3077
03:41:47,899 --> 03:41:48,940
Why did I even come here?

3078
03:41:48,940 --> 03:41:52,379
I told- I said that I wanted to rest up and get my energy levels higher.

3079
03:41:53,180 --> 03:41:54,540
And then I get a call from Hillary.

3080
03:41:57,100 --> 03:41:57,600
No.

3081
03:41:58,540 --> 03:41:59,420
He has worms.

3082
03:42:12,149 --> 03:42:15,799
I'm going to travel to Batuu and become a Jedi.

3083
03:42:16,360 --> 03:42:20,149
First, I'm going to pee.

3084
03:42:20,870 --> 03:42:23,270
And then I'm going to eat leftover pizza.

3085
03:42:24,940 --> 03:42:26,219
And then I'm going to wash my hands.

3086
03:42:26,219 --> 03:42:27,260
And then I'm going to brush my teeth.

3087
03:42:28,389 --> 03:42:29,030
Go.

3088
03:42:29,030 --> 03:42:44,010
Am I eating it out of the sink?

3089
03:42:44,010 --> 03:42:44,510
Okay.

3090
03:42:44,969 --> 03:42:46,139
Everything looks good.

3091
03:42:46,860 --> 03:42:48,309
Be the dog.

3092
03:42:50,200 --> 03:42:50,680
There you go.

3093
03:42:54,540 --> 03:42:55,979
All right, let's do it.

3094
03:42:55,979 --> 03:42:56,540
What time is it?

3095
03:42:56,540 --> 03:42:57,340
Oh, it's 1 a.m.

3096
03:42:57,340 --> 03:42:58,139
Never mind.

3097
03:42:58,139 --> 03:42:59,209
I'll just go to sleep.

3098
03:42:59,209 --> 03:43:00,409
But I'm not going to work tomorrow.

3099
03:43:00,409 --> 03:43:02,500
Go to bed.

3100
03:43:02,500 --> 03:43:03,219
Wake up.

3101
03:43:03,219 --> 03:43:05,260
None of the time was awful.

3102
03:43:07,979 --> 03:43:08,940
Maybe next year?

3103
03:43:08,940 --> 03:43:09,579
What do you mean?

3104
03:43:09,579 --> 03:43:12,409
Was it- is it New Year's Eve?

3105
03:43:12,409 --> 03:43:14,889
Did I leave the New Year's Eve party early?

3106
03:43:14,889 --> 03:43:17,049
I slept through the New Year's Eve party.

3107
03:43:17,049 --> 03:43:18,620
That's what that was?

3108
03:43:21,850 --> 03:43:22,889
Oh, it was.

3109
03:43:24,059 --> 03:43:24,940
Wait, was it?

3110
03:43:25,500 --> 03:43:33,030
I fell asleep on the couch at 10 o'clock.

3111
03:43:33,030 --> 03:43:35,450
Whatever.

3112
03:43:35,450 --> 03:43:36,809
I'm going to be a Jedi, so who cares?

3113
03:43:37,530 --> 03:43:39,579
No, today is New Year's Eve.

3114
03:43:41,850 --> 03:43:42,350
Okay.

3115
03:43:43,260 --> 03:43:43,819
Countdown.

3116
03:43:43,819 --> 03:43:46,780
Stay up past bedtime and shout at the TV in celebration.

3117
03:43:46,780 --> 03:43:50,469
Don't put off until tomorrow what you do today.

3118
03:43:50,469 --> 03:43:52,469
Click on your sims like, make resolution.

3119
03:43:52,469 --> 03:43:54,299
Okay.

3120
03:43:55,579 --> 03:43:58,219
Drink, dance, and play music.

3121
03:43:58,219 --> 03:43:59,100
Decorate.

3122
03:43:59,100 --> 03:44:00,899
All right, we'll get up.

3123
03:44:00,899 --> 03:44:02,420
I need to- I'm going to make a resolution.

3124
03:44:02,420 --> 03:44:10,469
Complete an aspiring milestone.

3125
03:44:10,469 --> 03:44:12,709
Get promoted, raise a skill, write a book.

3126
03:44:12,709 --> 03:44:17,979
Get a significant other.

3127
03:44:17,979 --> 03:44:19,989
What should I do?

3128
03:44:19,989 --> 03:44:20,870
Significant other?

3129
03:44:20,870 --> 03:44:23,110
Okay.

3130
03:44:23,110 --> 03:44:26,790
Let's go to Batuu.

3131
03:44:32,010 --> 03:44:36,459
I'll celebrate New Year's Eve when I get back.

3132
03:44:36,459 --> 03:44:36,940
Travel.

3133
03:44:38,260 --> 03:44:41,700
Should I take Santa to the Star Wars world?

3134
03:44:41,700 --> 03:44:48,629
I'm taking Santa.

3135
03:44:48,629 --> 03:44:48,950
Okay.

3136
03:44:49,879 --> 03:44:51,239
Where's Batuu?

3137
03:44:51,239 --> 03:45:03,559
Is it even up here?

3138
03:45:03,559 --> 03:45:05,079
Where's the Star Wars land?

3139
03:45:05,079 --> 03:45:06,280
It's vacation.

3140
03:45:12,680 --> 03:45:14,040
Take a vacation.

3141
03:45:14,040 --> 03:45:18,040
Okay.

3142
03:45:25,239 --> 03:45:26,440
All right, vacation.

3143
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:33,750
Where's the Star Wars land?

3144
03:45:33,750 --> 03:45:44,540
Oh, it's right there.

3145
03:45:49,579 --> 03:45:51,239
It's time.

3146
03:45:51,239 --> 03:45:52,200
Okay, here we go.

3147
03:45:52,200 --> 03:45:53,959
Black Spire Outpost.

3148
03:45:53,959 --> 03:45:55,399
It's the central hub of Batuu.

3149
03:45:55,399 --> 03:45:57,319
Here you can find the dwelling.

3150
03:45:57,319 --> 03:45:58,680
Ogus Cantina.

3151
03:45:58,680 --> 03:46:00,360
Doc Ondar's Den of Antiques

3152
03:46:00,360 --> 03:46:01,879
and a number of food and drink options.

3153
03:46:05,399 --> 03:46:05,879
Here we go.

3154
03:46:11,690 --> 03:46:13,690
Everybody, get your bat chests ready.

3155
03:46:16,149 --> 03:46:17,030
Welcome to Batuu.

3156
03:46:17,670 --> 03:46:20,680
You use a different currency called Galactic Credits.

3157
03:46:21,239 --> 03:46:22,280
They have special inventory.

3158
03:46:22,280 --> 03:46:24,760
Don't worry, your simoleons and inventory are safe at home.

3159
03:46:24,760 --> 03:46:27,110
Check the career pin of your first mission.

3160
03:46:29,239 --> 03:46:31,879
Santa's dressed like a Jedi.

3161
03:46:32,680 --> 03:46:33,000
Okay.

3162
03:46:33,879 --> 03:46:35,079
Welcome to Batuu.

3163
03:46:35,079 --> 03:46:37,719
Plan your Batuu outfit at the dwelling.

3164
03:46:38,360 --> 03:46:41,940
Freshen up at the dwelling

3165
03:46:41,940 --> 03:46:43,940
and order food from Docking Bay 7.

3166
03:46:49,030 --> 03:46:49,829
Okay.

3167
03:46:49,829 --> 03:47:00,469
I'm going to order a drink.

3168
03:47:01,750 --> 03:47:02,709
I'm going to get a water.

3169
03:47:03,510 --> 03:47:09,299
I don't want to lose Santa.

3170
03:47:09,940 --> 03:47:12,170
It was just like Star Wars.

3171
03:47:12,170 --> 03:47:13,610
It's just like Star Wars world.

3172
03:47:18,180 --> 03:47:19,700
Special Star Wars water.

3173
03:47:20,979 --> 03:47:21,479
Yeah.

3174
03:47:22,200 --> 03:47:22,680
There's gold.

3175
03:47:22,680 --> 03:47:25,399
They put two drops of fucking green food coloring in it.

3176
03:47:26,809 --> 03:47:27,770
And it's $14.

3177
03:47:28,889 --> 03:47:36,719
I got to order a drink.

3178
03:47:42,840 --> 03:47:43,959
Oh, I already ordered a water.

3179
03:47:44,760 --> 03:47:47,049
Order food from Docking Bay 7.

3180
03:47:47,049 --> 03:47:48,010
Is this Docking Bay 7?

3181
03:47:48,729 --> 03:47:55,719
Ask about the resistance.

3182
03:48:01,879 --> 03:48:02,200
Yeah.

3183
03:48:02,200 --> 03:48:05,719
You know, if I had the mods with people getting hit by cars,

3184
03:48:05,719 --> 03:48:07,559
can you imagine just how would this even happen?

3185
03:48:08,360 --> 03:48:10,719
Okay.

3186
03:48:10,719 --> 03:48:11,360
Order food.

3187
03:48:15,520 --> 03:48:16,639
Outpost popcorn.

3188
03:48:17,600 --> 03:48:19,440
Rising Moon's Overnight Oats.

3189
03:48:19,440 --> 03:48:20,159
That's what I'm going to have.

3190
03:48:23,100 --> 03:48:24,379
Add that mod immediately.

3191
03:48:25,340 --> 03:48:27,739
Look, we're going to do normal for a little while,

3192
03:48:27,739 --> 03:48:31,340
and then I promise I will put on all the clown mods.

3193
03:48:31,340 --> 03:48:33,100
They'll all go on in the next day.

3194
03:48:33,899 --> 03:48:35,739
Just let me play the Sims normally.

3195
03:48:36,459 --> 03:48:39,840
It's been very abnormal so far, but you know,

3196
03:48:39,840 --> 03:48:41,200
we're doing clown mods.

3197
03:48:41,200 --> 03:48:41,760
I promise.

3198
03:48:50,649 --> 03:48:51,149
Okay.

3199
03:48:52,010 --> 03:48:52,729
I got my food.

3200
03:48:53,690 --> 03:48:54,409
I'll move.

3201
03:49:03,530 --> 03:49:05,530
It's time to start the music.

3202
03:49:05,530 --> 03:49:06,889
It's time to light the light.

3203
03:49:07,610 --> 03:49:10,409
It's time to make the music at the Muppet Show tonight.

3204
03:49:11,610 --> 03:49:12,329
It's time to...

3205
03:49:12,329 --> 03:49:12,889
Is it that way?

3206
03:49:12,889 --> 03:49:13,370
This isn't...

3207
03:49:13,370 --> 03:49:14,010
Wait, this is different.

3208
03:49:14,010 --> 03:49:14,889
This is not the Muppet song.

3209
03:49:16,409 --> 03:49:17,770
This is the Antenna song.

3210
03:49:18,649 --> 03:49:22,030
How come I didn't get the credit for that?

3211
03:49:27,850 --> 03:49:28,969
Stormtrooper?

3212
03:49:28,969 --> 03:49:45,000
How do I join the First Order?

3213
03:49:45,000 --> 03:49:45,639
I want to be a Sith.

3214
03:49:53,530 --> 03:49:56,719
What does it say?

3215
03:49:57,600 --> 03:49:59,120
If you are looking to join our ranks,

3216
03:49:59,120 --> 03:50:01,920
speak with Lieutenant Agnon in the First Order District.

3217
03:50:02,559 --> 03:50:06,569
You got it.

3218
03:50:06,569 --> 03:50:13,719
I'm going to freshen up.

3219
03:50:13,719 --> 03:50:15,159
All right, freshen up at the dwelling.

3220
03:50:15,159 --> 03:50:15,959
Where's my dwelling?

3221
03:50:15,959 --> 03:50:16,360
Over here?

3222
03:50:16,920 --> 03:50:21,500
How long am I on vacation for?

3223
03:50:23,950 --> 03:50:24,989
And where is Santa?

3224
03:50:25,790 --> 03:50:29,959
Okay, freshen up.

3225
03:50:30,680 --> 03:50:32,959
Okay, I gotta plan my outfit.

3226
03:50:35,770 --> 03:50:37,370
Plan Batuu outfit.

3227
03:50:37,370 --> 03:50:39,549
All right.

3228
03:50:43,180 --> 03:51:29,040
Where are our fucking pants?

3229
03:51:38,219 --> 03:51:39,180
I won't...

3230
03:51:40,729 --> 03:51:41,049
God.

3231
03:51:44,879 --> 03:51:45,280
That's fine.

3232
03:51:45,280 --> 03:51:46,079
I can stay like that.

3233
03:51:49,840 --> 03:51:52,639
I got bigger by coming to this Batuu world?

3234
03:52:07,639 --> 03:52:08,920
I want to be in a Stormtrooper outfit.

3235
03:52:31,920 --> 03:52:32,479
Whatever.

3236
03:52:32,479 --> 03:52:33,120
This is fine.

3237
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:33,600
I don't care.

3238
03:52:34,399 --> 03:52:44,920
All right.

3239
03:52:44,920 --> 03:52:49,870
Now I need to order food from Docking Bay 7.

3240
03:52:49,870 --> 03:52:52,030
Which that's...

3241
03:52:52,030 --> 03:52:54,000
Order food from Docking Bay 7.

3242
03:52:54,000 --> 03:52:54,159
All right.

3243
03:52:54,159 --> 03:52:54,559
There it is.

3244
03:52:59,479 --> 03:53:00,200
I can't go in here?

3245
03:53:06,649 --> 03:53:10,989
Okay, I want a Braised Shack Roast.

3246
03:53:11,870 --> 03:53:12,190
Please.

3247
03:53:13,149 --> 03:53:16,510
I want a single serving of that.

3248
03:53:18,649 --> 03:53:19,610
Ask about the First Order.

3249
03:53:19,610 --> 03:53:20,569
Ask about the Resistance.

3250
03:53:21,129 --> 03:53:24,559
What if I have no money left?

3251
03:53:24,559 --> 03:53:32,989
This feels like one of those information games

3252
03:53:32,989 --> 03:53:34,989
about the movie that comes in the DVD.

3253
03:53:36,510 --> 03:53:37,709
You know, there's two DVDs.

3254
03:53:39,639 --> 03:53:42,440
And you go, oh, ask about the First Order.

3255
03:53:42,440 --> 03:53:44,940
I'm just going to give you little tidbits

3256
03:53:44,940 --> 03:53:49,840
about the story of the DVD that you just got.

3257
03:53:49,840 --> 03:53:56,799
This is a DVD game.

3258
03:53:56,799 --> 03:53:59,120
I wonder what happens if I ask about the First Order.

3259
03:53:59,760 --> 03:54:03,479
Come here.

3260
03:54:03,479 --> 03:54:08,750
I just want a lightsaber to put in my house.

3261
03:54:13,629 --> 03:54:14,350
Okay.

3262
03:54:14,350 --> 03:54:16,559
Is it every neighborhood on...

3263
03:54:16,559 --> 03:54:17,280
What the hell?

3264
03:54:18,159 --> 03:54:18,719
Don't leave.

3265
03:54:19,959 --> 03:54:21,079
You learned how to...

3266
03:54:21,079 --> 03:54:24,280
What do you mean I learned how to make Braised Shack Roast?

3267
03:54:24,280 --> 03:54:25,559
Isn't that a made-up animal?

3268
03:54:26,120 --> 03:54:27,719
That animal doesn't make...

3269
03:54:27,719 --> 03:54:29,079
That's not a real animal.

3270
03:54:29,079 --> 03:54:31,709
How would I have learned the recipe?

3271
03:54:34,120 --> 03:54:34,680
Is this a...

3272
03:54:34,680 --> 03:54:35,399
Hold on.

3273
03:54:35,399 --> 03:54:37,239
Is this a vacation spot in The Sims

3274
03:54:37,239 --> 03:54:38,920
like it's pretending to be Disney?

3275
03:54:38,920 --> 03:54:39,639
Or is this...

3276
03:54:39,639 --> 03:54:40,920
You're actually on Batuu.

3277
03:54:41,719 --> 03:54:44,680
Is it just a Disneyland?

3278
03:54:44,680 --> 03:54:45,479
This is not supposed to be...

3279
03:55:05,950 --> 03:55:07,149
Oh, where's Kylo Ren?

3280
03:55:09,690 --> 03:55:18,319
Where's Santa?

3281
03:55:28,840 --> 03:55:29,959
That's kind of what I was singing.

3282
03:55:30,780 --> 03:55:31,260
Come back here.

3283
03:55:31,260 --> 03:55:32,299
I need to talk to you more about

3284
03:55:33,020 --> 03:55:37,950
the rest of this DVD package ad part of DLC.

3285
03:55:37,950 --> 03:55:38,350
Come here.

3286
03:55:40,159 --> 03:55:42,479
Can you tell me some more about the world of Star Wars?

3287
03:55:51,280 --> 03:55:52,239
Ask about the First Order.

3288
03:55:58,729 --> 03:55:59,049
Okay.

3289
03:55:59,049 --> 03:56:01,370
I need to talk to Lieutenant Agnon in the First Order District.

3290
03:56:04,010 --> 03:56:05,049
Ask about the Resistance.

3291
03:56:05,690 --> 03:56:06,620
Three times.

3292
03:56:12,239 --> 03:56:13,520
I'm so annoying to this person.

3293
03:56:14,479 --> 03:56:15,600
Does this person work here?

3294
03:56:15,600 --> 03:56:16,079
Is that what it's...

3295
03:56:16,079 --> 03:56:16,639
What it's...

3296
03:56:16,639 --> 03:56:17,280
What it's implied?

3297
03:56:29,870 --> 03:56:31,370
Okay, scoundrels.

3298
03:56:34,190 --> 03:56:35,790
Vile scum are definitely on Batuu.

3299
03:56:35,790 --> 03:56:37,629
If you see anything suspicious, report to the First Order.

3300
03:56:42,799 --> 03:56:44,239
Can I tell you about my dreams?

3301
03:56:49,149 --> 03:56:51,309
I had a dream about a green alien.

3302
03:56:51,309 --> 03:56:52,030
It bit me.

3303
03:56:52,030 --> 03:56:53,069
It bit me in the face.

3304
03:56:54,030 --> 03:56:54,829
And I woke up.

3305
03:56:54,829 --> 03:56:55,549
I'm sweating.

3306
03:57:03,129 --> 03:57:04,329
No, scoundrels.

3307
03:57:04,329 --> 03:57:05,370
Okay, fun.

3308
03:57:07,069 --> 03:57:08,590
The festival of snow has started.

3309
03:57:09,149 --> 03:57:09,549
I don't care.

3310
03:57:09,549 --> 03:57:10,190
I'm on vacation.

3311
03:57:11,360 --> 03:57:13,120
Okay, I have to go to find this lieutenant.

3312
03:57:13,760 --> 03:57:16,360
Okay, cool.

3313
03:57:16,360 --> 03:57:17,479
I'm having fun on vacation.

3314
03:57:20,440 --> 03:57:21,319
Congratulations for completing your...

3315
03:57:21,319 --> 03:57:21,799
What did I say?

3316
03:57:23,079 --> 03:57:23,479
First mission.

3317
03:57:23,479 --> 03:57:24,840
Now that you have your bearings,

3318
03:57:24,840 --> 03:57:27,639
explore the other neighborhoods of Batuu by clicking travel in your phone.

3319
03:57:27,879 --> 03:57:28,440
Chinosa.

3320
03:57:29,239 --> 03:57:30,920
Build your reputation with three factions.

3321
03:57:32,360 --> 03:57:33,000
All right, let's go.

3322
03:57:41,049 --> 03:57:42,489
Let's go do the First Order.

3323
03:57:42,489 --> 03:57:43,290
Why are you so red?

3324
03:57:43,290 --> 03:57:43,850
I don't know.

3325
03:57:43,850 --> 03:57:45,530
I've been trying to figure that out for the last four hours.

3326
03:57:48,170 --> 03:57:49,290
All right, First Order District.

3327
03:57:53,129 --> 03:57:55,049
I see why people say this is the worst expansion.

3328
03:58:02,510 --> 03:58:03,469
How much is a lightsaber?

3329
03:58:04,110 --> 03:58:06,030
I just want to buy a lightsaber.

3330
03:58:14,600 --> 03:58:15,239
Okay, here we go.

3331
03:58:17,149 --> 03:58:18,110
Ask to see missions.

3332
03:58:18,829 --> 03:58:21,799
How much was this one?

3333
03:58:21,799 --> 03:58:22,680
I don't know.

3334
03:58:22,680 --> 03:58:25,319
I think it was like more than 15, 20 dollars.

3335
03:58:26,040 --> 03:58:31,290
Spread the word about our vision of the future for Black Spire Outpost.

3336
03:58:31,290 --> 03:58:33,930
Citizens must understand that everything we do is for their own good.

3337
03:58:35,690 --> 03:58:37,690
Okay, how do I do it?

3338
03:58:40,319 --> 03:58:42,399
Spread First Order propaganda.

3339
03:58:47,920 --> 03:58:48,399
To who?

3340
03:58:49,739 --> 03:58:50,700
This park is empty.

3341
03:58:51,420 --> 03:58:55,340
There's nobody here.

3342
03:58:55,340 --> 03:58:58,510
It's just me and the actors.

3343
03:58:59,229 --> 03:59:03,469
This is a really unpopular park.

3344
03:59:04,110 --> 03:59:10,459
Why is nobody here?

3345
03:59:10,459 --> 03:59:11,819
There's no other Sims here.

3346
03:59:12,299 --> 03:59:17,389
How do I spread propaganda?

3347
03:59:18,030 --> 03:59:24,559
Wait, do I have to do I take this back to the regular Sims world?

3348
03:59:25,680 --> 03:59:27,680
Should I give Santa propaganda?

3349
03:59:36,219 --> 03:59:40,680
How do I do that?

3350
03:59:47,549 --> 03:59:48,430
Discuss the force.

3351
03:59:54,639 --> 03:59:55,760
Why does he think they're actors?

3352
03:59:57,760 --> 03:59:58,959
Wait, are they not actors?

3353
03:59:58,959 --> 03:59:59,680
Is this an alien?

3354
03:59:59,680 --> 04:00:00,559
This is a real alien.

3355
04:00:01,440 --> 04:00:03,440
I don't understand where this sits.

3356
04:00:04,239 --> 04:00:11,069
Is this an actor?

3357
04:00:19,870 --> 04:00:20,829
But it's a vacation.

3358
04:00:20,829 --> 04:00:21,790
I'm I don't get it.

3359
04:00:22,510 --> 04:00:23,159
Where am I?

3360
04:00:23,719 --> 04:00:28,090
Stop chatting over here and get out of it.

3361
04:00:28,090 --> 04:00:28,569
Go over here.

3362
04:00:28,569 --> 04:00:30,649
You have to spread some First Order propaganda.

3363
04:00:30,649 --> 04:00:31,850
I want a red lightsaber.

3364
04:00:32,409 --> 04:00:34,620
I don't care how long it takes.

3365
04:00:35,260 --> 04:00:41,819
I will literally I will not go back to work until I get a red lightsaber.

3366
04:00:42,540 --> 04:00:52,170
Will you stop talking?

3367
04:00:52,889 --> 04:00:57,479
Okay, here we go.

3368
04:01:01,799 --> 04:01:04,440
Almost controlling his life will finally fulfill his dreams.

3369
04:01:05,159 --> 04:01:09,399
Oh, it's great that the First Order is here to help.

3370
04:01:10,040 --> 04:01:12,399
All right, I have to do this a few more times.

3371
04:01:12,399 --> 04:01:16,329
All right.

3372
04:01:16,329 --> 04:01:16,729
All right.

3373
04:01:16,729 --> 04:01:17,770
I am First Order.

3374
04:01:17,770 --> 04:01:18,329
I'm almost there.

3375
04:01:19,049 --> 04:01:20,459
Hey, you, come here.

3376
04:01:28,889 --> 04:01:30,649
This is great fucking game play.

3377
04:01:35,450 --> 04:01:39,530
I what I paid $20, whatever it was for this, and I'm going to do it.

3378
04:01:39,530 --> 04:01:40,889
And I'm going to get a lightsaber.

3379
04:01:41,690 --> 04:01:43,290
That's just what's happening tonight.

3380
04:01:43,290 --> 04:01:44,329
I'm sorry.

3381
04:01:44,329 --> 04:01:46,250
I'm getting I'm going to speed run a lightsaber.

3382
04:01:46,809 --> 04:01:53,879
I need to spread First Order propaganda.

3383
04:01:58,540 --> 04:01:59,579
It won't take very long.

3384
04:01:59,579 --> 04:02:00,059
Don't worry.

3385
04:02:00,059 --> 04:02:01,500
I'm going to be on vacation for like three days.

3386
04:02:01,500 --> 04:02:03,180
And I'm going to finally I'm going to get a lightsaber.

3387
04:02:07,120 --> 04:02:14,489
Scan the First Order supplies and get a blaster.

3388
04:02:20,969 --> 04:02:21,770
Where do I get that?

3389
04:02:24,489 --> 04:02:26,729
Where's your dog at dogs at the house?

3390
04:02:26,729 --> 04:02:28,010
But no, he's been taken care of.

3391
04:02:28,010 --> 04:02:28,969
I don't know where Santa is, though.

3392
04:02:30,090 --> 04:02:34,250
All right, I need to do four more propaganda.

3393
04:02:34,889 --> 04:02:40,649
Come on, let's go.

3394
04:02:46,879 --> 04:02:56,639
OK, that person hates me, but that's whatever in the gunk.

3395
04:03:02,329 --> 04:03:07,819
Take gunk droid propaganda propaganda.

3396
04:03:08,459 --> 04:03:13,370
OK, propaganda.

3397
04:03:14,010 --> 04:03:21,100
One more do.

3398
04:03:21,100 --> 04:03:25,000
Uh, can I make friends with what's your name?

3399
04:03:25,799 --> 04:03:28,360
Not to sit as a kind of friends and they invite you over to the house.

3400
04:03:37,420 --> 04:03:42,059
Oh, oh, it's seven.

3401
04:03:42,780 --> 04:03:44,620
It's seven thirty Pacific.

3402
04:03:45,180 --> 04:03:46,139
We all know what that means.

3403
04:03:47,709 --> 04:03:50,110
The Internet doesn't work for like 40 minutes.

3404
04:03:52,489 --> 04:03:55,959
Oh, we all know what that means.

3405
04:04:05,389 --> 04:04:05,629
All right.

3406
04:04:05,629 --> 04:04:06,190
Any propaganda?

3407
04:04:11,530 --> 04:04:12,250
Yeah, we just got up.

3408
04:04:12,250 --> 04:04:19,159
We got to ride out the storm here for about 40 minutes.

3409
04:04:19,879 --> 04:04:22,680
We're going to be dropping some frames.

3410
04:04:22,680 --> 04:04:24,200
This is how it is for some reason.

3411
04:04:24,200 --> 04:04:25,319
Randomly on random.

3412
04:04:25,879 --> 04:04:26,840
What is today?

3413
04:04:26,840 --> 04:04:28,350
What's today's date?

3414
04:04:28,350 --> 04:04:28,750
Tuesday?

3415
04:04:37,819 --> 04:04:38,459
All right, there it is.

3416
04:04:39,020 --> 04:04:41,629
Hey, it's all right.

3417
04:04:41,629 --> 04:04:43,229
Hey, you were going to skip this part of the stream anyways.

3418
04:04:43,229 --> 04:04:44,430
Well, I get my lightsaber.

3419
04:04:44,430 --> 04:04:44,909
It's all good.

3420
04:04:45,549 --> 04:04:49,479
Is that person all right?

3421
04:04:55,600 --> 04:04:56,719
Check your Sim's inventory.

3422
04:05:06,040 --> 04:05:07,479
Oh, I get a blaster.

3423
04:05:11,639 --> 04:05:12,520
Fake ID card.

3424
04:05:13,079 --> 04:05:17,709
I don't have a fake ID.

3425
04:05:19,629 --> 04:05:20,590
All right, I got it now.

3426
04:05:22,139 --> 04:05:25,180
Oh, my God, this is going to take way longer.

3427
04:05:27,840 --> 04:05:29,200
I thought that was going to be a full cube.

3428
04:05:30,200 --> 04:05:30,760
It's all right.

3429
04:05:31,559 --> 04:05:32,680
Well, the Internet sucks.

3430
04:05:32,680 --> 04:05:33,159
Don't worry.

3431
04:05:34,120 --> 04:05:34,600
We'll take it.

3432
04:05:35,680 --> 04:05:36,319
I can cheat.

3433
04:05:36,959 --> 04:05:46,639
I can.

3434
04:05:46,639 --> 04:05:47,120
Oh, that's right.

3435
04:05:47,120 --> 04:05:47,680
I can cheat.

3436
04:05:51,120 --> 04:05:57,629
Oh, Marian alien.

3437
04:05:57,629 --> 04:05:59,790
Let me become friends with an alien

3438
04:05:59,790 --> 04:06:01,389
because I'm very curious if these people,

3439
04:06:01,389 --> 04:06:06,000
they exist in the kind of real world,

3440
04:06:06,000 --> 04:06:07,520
like Earth or I don't know where we are.

3441
04:06:10,639 --> 04:06:12,079
Can I make friends with this person?

3442
04:06:27,549 --> 04:06:30,190
OK, so I'm getting a relationship status.

3443
04:06:30,430 --> 04:06:31,549
Easy, Yama Sprada.

3444
04:06:33,420 --> 04:06:35,899
Wait, I, I, I know them now.

3445
04:06:38,120 --> 04:06:40,200
OK, so can I invite them to parties and stuff?

3446
04:06:51,659 --> 04:06:53,180
Are you recording this from McDonald's?

3447
04:06:53,979 --> 04:06:55,659
No, it's just randomly at some.

3448
04:06:55,659 --> 04:06:58,379
I, dude, I wish I could tell you how this is even possible.

3449
04:06:59,260 --> 04:07:03,079
So this is the most ridiculous, bizarre thing.

3450
04:07:04,110 --> 04:07:05,149
So do you age here?

3451
04:07:05,149 --> 04:07:07,159
I don't know.

3452
04:07:07,159 --> 04:07:09,399
So from seven thirty to like seven,

3453
04:07:09,399 --> 04:07:11,559
like fifty or seven thirty to like eight.

3454
04:07:12,440 --> 04:07:14,600
My Internet goes to fucking like one percent speeds.

3455
04:07:17,209 --> 04:07:19,290
And then it goes back to a thousand, a thousand

3456
04:07:19,290 --> 04:07:20,489
for the rest of the day, all day.

3457
04:07:21,530 --> 04:07:22,649
It doesn't make any sense.

3458
04:07:22,649 --> 04:07:23,450
It makes no sense.

3459
04:07:25,899 --> 04:07:28,780
It goes from a thousand, a thousand at like seven twenty nine

3460
04:07:29,420 --> 04:07:32,299
to one megabit per second at seven thirty.

3461
04:07:32,299 --> 04:07:32,799
Exactly.

3462
04:07:33,739 --> 04:07:37,180
And then at like eight twenty PM

3463
04:07:37,180 --> 04:07:38,459
goes right back to a thousand thousand.

3464
04:07:41,629 --> 04:07:42,430
It doesn't make any sense.

3465
04:07:44,829 --> 04:07:47,770
All right, I need to go to the bathroom.

3466
04:07:47,770 --> 04:07:48,649
But this is why.

3467
04:07:48,649 --> 04:07:50,489
So another reason why I wanted to start my streams.

3468
04:07:56,540 --> 04:07:59,840
What was that alarm?

3469
04:07:59,840 --> 04:08:00,639
All right, I need to use the bathroom.

3470
04:08:00,639 --> 04:08:01,440
Where's the bathroom?

3471
04:08:02,000 --> 04:08:10,719
Where is the bathroom?

3472
04:08:12,159 --> 04:08:13,049
Oh, it's right here.

3473
04:08:22,459 --> 04:08:22,700
All right.

3474
04:08:22,700 --> 04:08:28,219
So how do I how do I cheat to get myself like plus five first order points?

3475
04:08:28,940 --> 04:08:40,590
Does anybody have the code?

3476
04:08:40,590 --> 04:08:49,899
I'll show I'll show that tomorrow.

3477
04:08:49,899 --> 04:08:51,040
I'll show that tomorrow.

3478
04:08:52,540 --> 04:08:53,979
New new viewers.

3479
04:08:54,620 --> 04:08:57,340
I have probably never seen that picture and I'll show it tomorrow.

3480
04:09:04,479 --> 04:09:04,639
All right.

3481
04:09:04,639 --> 04:09:05,360
So what's the cheat?

3482
04:09:09,760 --> 04:09:10,559
Yeah, I'll be left tomorrow.

3483
04:09:16,750 --> 04:09:18,350
And tomorrow I'll put mods on tomorrow.

3484
04:09:19,069 --> 04:09:20,270
But I'm going to make them.

3485
04:09:20,270 --> 04:09:22,190
We're going to do them slowly.

3486
04:09:23,149 --> 04:09:24,190
It's not just going to be.

3487
04:09:24,989 --> 04:09:27,469
Everyone gets hit by a car and everybody gets hurt.

3488
04:09:27,469 --> 04:09:28,270
It's going to be slow.

3489
04:09:28,829 --> 04:09:31,790
It's going to be going to just very slowly get into it.

3490
04:09:42,959 --> 04:09:43,840
Okay, what is it?

3491
04:09:43,840 --> 04:09:49,280
Okay, it's control shift C enter testing cheats true.

3492
04:09:49,920 --> 04:09:56,840
And then shift click your Sim and do give all items testing cheats true.

3493
04:09:56,840 --> 04:09:58,440
And then shift click and give all items.

3494
04:09:58,440 --> 04:09:59,799
I mean, I got to read this again.

3495
04:10:05,930 --> 04:10:12,700
Shift C testing cheats true.

3496
04:10:13,500 --> 04:10:15,530
Shift click your Sim.

3497
04:10:15,530 --> 04:10:16,329
Batu cheats.

3498
04:10:16,889 --> 04:10:25,049
Okay, this expansion sucks.

3499
04:10:27,399 --> 04:10:28,200
But that's not fair.

3500
04:10:28,200 --> 04:10:29,079
It's it's cool.

3501
04:10:29,079 --> 04:10:30,920
If you're a big Star Wars fan, I'm a big star.

3502
04:10:30,920 --> 04:10:32,040
I would probably like this.

3503
04:10:32,760 --> 04:10:34,159
At least I don't know.

3504
04:10:34,159 --> 04:10:38,920
Like what I you just walk around and like talk to people and just grind out.

3505
04:10:39,719 --> 04:10:41,479
I mean, it's kind of it's all right.

3506
04:10:41,479 --> 04:10:42,040
It's all right.

3507
04:10:42,040 --> 04:10:42,280
All right.

3508
04:10:42,280 --> 04:10:55,229
So now what do I do?

3509
04:11:04,649 --> 04:11:05,209
It's spring.

3510
04:11:07,709 --> 04:11:19,049
Pack cheats, expansion packs, name packs, batu cheats, batu reputation.

3511
04:11:19,690 --> 04:11:27,389
First order, add set level to rank five.

3512
04:11:32,940 --> 04:11:37,120
Okay, and batu cheats.

3513
04:11:38,190 --> 04:11:39,309
Give batu items.

3514
04:11:45,149 --> 04:11:46,750
Dude, I didn't want literally the end.

3515
04:11:46,750 --> 04:11:48,270
I didn't want every single item.

3516
04:11:48,829 --> 04:11:56,120
How do I take this out?

3517
04:11:59,790 --> 04:12:11,280
How do I use my lightsaber lightsaber?

3518
04:12:11,280 --> 04:12:12,959
You're lightsaber hilt collection.

3519
04:12:12,959 --> 04:12:14,399
Don't use a lightsaber.

3520
04:12:15,040 --> 04:12:19,469
What do you mean you don't use a lightsaber?

3521
04:12:20,030 --> 04:12:24,329
I need a crystal.

3522
04:12:24,329 --> 04:12:25,049
You have to make it.

3523
04:12:25,610 --> 04:12:27,959
Where do I go to do that?

3524
04:12:30,760 --> 04:12:31,719
You have to drag it out.

3525
04:12:44,239 --> 04:12:45,760
You need to build the lightsaber.

3526
04:12:48,239 --> 04:12:49,600
Control shift, click your Sim.

3527
04:12:49,600 --> 04:12:50,079
Woohoo.

3528
04:12:50,079 --> 04:12:50,719
Jabba the Hut.

3529
04:12:53,950 --> 04:12:54,829
It's furniture.

3530
04:12:57,450 --> 04:12:59,610
It's it's just a piece of furniture.

3531
04:13:02,139 --> 04:13:02,459
Okay.

3532
04:13:03,440 --> 04:13:04,879
All right, Santa, let's get out of here.

3533
04:13:05,760 --> 04:13:06,959
It's time to go home, Santa.

3534
04:13:11,530 --> 04:13:12,329
It's time to go.

3535
04:13:12,329 --> 04:13:12,809
Let's leave.

3536
04:13:13,209 --> 04:13:14,090
It's time to leave.

3537
04:13:14,090 --> 04:13:14,969
I thought it was going to be like a

3538
04:13:17,370 --> 04:13:19,129
I thought it was going to be like swinging around.

3539
04:13:30,649 --> 04:13:31,850
I can't leave.

3540
04:13:31,850 --> 04:13:36,520
Check Santa's ID.

3541
04:13:58,489 --> 04:13:59,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3542
04:13:59,610 --> 04:14:01,290
Hey, wait, wait, what are you doing?

3543
04:14:02,010 --> 04:14:02,329
Why?

3544
04:14:03,770 --> 04:14:04,409
What's happening?

3545
04:14:05,370 --> 04:14:07,370
I wanted to show my I want to put my crystal in.

3546
04:14:09,629 --> 04:14:10,190
What did he do?

3547
04:14:10,190 --> 04:14:10,989
Why did he do that?

3548
04:14:12,030 --> 04:14:12,670
Am I okay?

3549
04:14:13,549 --> 04:14:14,190
What happened?

3550
04:14:14,829 --> 04:14:24,479
I got knocked.

3551
04:14:24,479 --> 04:14:25,680
Santa knocked me out.

3552
04:14:38,120 --> 04:14:39,239
No, keep that out.

3553
04:14:39,239 --> 04:14:40,200
Don't put that on.

3554
04:14:40,200 --> 04:14:40,760
Keep it out.

3555
04:14:56,000 --> 04:14:57,280
Train with lightsaber.

3556
04:15:09,069 --> 04:15:10,510
Who fbs Andy?

3557
04:15:10,510 --> 04:15:10,989
Fuck.

3558
04:15:10,989 --> 04:15:11,709
I know.

3559
04:15:11,709 --> 04:15:12,030
Shit.

3560
04:15:13,069 --> 04:15:13,790
God damn it.

3561
04:15:13,790 --> 04:15:16,190
I got to the my favorite part of the entire day.

3562
04:15:20,360 --> 04:15:20,840
All right.

3563
04:15:20,840 --> 04:15:21,159
Shit.

3564
04:15:21,159 --> 04:15:21,639
You know what?

3565
04:15:21,639 --> 04:15:24,040
I think I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to throw an audible out here.

3566
04:15:24,840 --> 04:15:26,200
Yeah, I think I'm all right.

3567
04:15:26,200 --> 04:15:27,079
Here's what I think is going to happen.

3568
04:15:28,620 --> 04:15:28,860
All right.

3569
04:15:28,860 --> 04:15:29,500
Here's what's happening.

3570
04:15:30,319 --> 04:15:31,600
We're going to call it right now.

3571
04:15:31,600 --> 04:15:33,840
I'm going to be back tomorrow early, like in the morning.

3572
04:15:33,840 --> 04:15:34,639
I'm going to go all day.

3573
04:15:38,000 --> 04:15:38,879
I think that's the plan.

3574
04:15:39,799 --> 04:15:40,520
I think that's the plan.

3575
04:15:40,520 --> 04:15:41,719
The plan is I got to start early.

3576
04:15:41,719 --> 04:15:42,920
I'm not starting at three o'clock tomorrow.

3577
04:15:42,920 --> 04:15:44,680
I'm starting at like noon tomorrow.

3578
04:15:46,090 --> 04:15:47,370
And I'm going to we're going to play this all day.

3579
04:15:47,370 --> 04:15:50,760
I'm going to put mods on it and we'll take it from there.

3580
04:15:50,760 --> 04:15:51,719
I got to start early.

3581
04:15:51,719 --> 04:15:53,739
I got to start earlier.

3582
04:15:53,739 --> 04:15:57,100
We got to avoid the we got to avoid the seven thirty p.m.

3583
04:15:58,219 --> 04:15:59,260
Internet meltdown.

3584
04:16:02,809 --> 04:16:05,930
So if I start at noon tomorrow between twelve and one,

3585
04:16:05,930 --> 04:16:08,889
then we can stream for six or seven hours and completely avoid it.

3586
04:16:10,079 --> 04:16:10,799
I think that's the play.

3587
04:16:13,149 --> 04:16:14,590
And hold me to this.

3588
04:16:14,590 --> 04:16:15,629
Hold me to this.

3589
04:16:15,629 --> 04:16:18,399
I want you to seriously hold me to this because

3590
04:16:18,399 --> 04:16:20,479
I can't start at three o'clock in the afternoon Pacific.

3591
04:16:20,479 --> 04:16:21,600
I can't I can't.

3592
04:16:23,760 --> 04:16:25,360
The streams have to be earlier.

3593
04:16:25,360 --> 04:16:28,079
The streams have to be earlier.

3594
04:16:28,079 --> 04:16:32,270
There's no way you're starting at noon.

3595
04:16:32,270 --> 04:16:34,190
I have to, though, because like this,

3596
04:16:34,190 --> 04:16:37,229
we hit the seven thirty p.m. hard turnoff.

3597
04:16:40,670 --> 04:16:42,030
And I also called my ISP.

3598
04:16:43,229 --> 04:16:44,540
Where am I?

3599
04:16:45,100 --> 04:16:49,610
All right.

3600
04:16:49,610 --> 04:16:50,409
Let me save this.

3601
04:16:50,409 --> 04:16:51,209
I got to save this.

3602
04:16:51,209 --> 04:16:52,170
We're saving it.

3603
04:16:52,170 --> 04:16:54,969
We're going to start fresh and early tomorrow.

3604
04:16:54,969 --> 04:16:57,129
Come to the flea market with me.

3605
04:16:57,129 --> 04:16:59,129
I don't I don't have time to do this right now.

3606
04:16:59,129 --> 04:17:02,000
We're going to start fresh tomorrow early.

3607
04:17:02,000 --> 04:17:04,250
Starting at noon.

3608
04:17:04,250 --> 04:17:09,690
And we're going until we're going until the Internet turns us off.

3609
04:17:09,690 --> 04:17:17,079
I'm glad we got to go at least for four and a half hours.

3610
04:17:17,079 --> 04:17:17,959
That's fun.

3611
04:17:17,959 --> 04:17:27,870
I'll be back tomorrow.

3612
04:17:27,870 --> 04:17:32,219
And for those of you that have been watching for a long time,

3613
04:17:32,219 --> 04:17:36,829
I mean, you know, it's kind of frame ratey.

3614
04:17:36,829 --> 04:17:38,190
Yeah, well, I'll be live tomorrow.

3615
04:17:38,190 --> 04:17:38,590
Don't worry.

3616
04:17:38,590 --> 04:17:41,129
We'll go for about six or seven hours.

3617
04:17:41,129 --> 04:17:42,489
There are a lot of people here today, too.

3618
04:17:42,489 --> 04:17:45,930
I just if you were if you stuck around from the Among Us thing,

3619
04:17:45,930 --> 04:17:49,100
that's where a lot of people came from, then cool.

3620
04:17:49,100 --> 04:17:51,260
I hope you enjoy the stream.

3621
04:17:51,260 --> 04:17:52,459
I had a really fun time.

3622
04:17:52,459 --> 04:17:54,540
The first four hours of the stream were really funny.

3623
04:17:54,540 --> 04:17:56,350
Had a lot of fun.

3624
04:17:56,350 --> 04:18:00,940
We'll see you tomorrow.

3625
04:18:00,940 --> 04:18:02,959
But what's this?

3626
04:18:03,600 --> 04:18:04,159
Those of you.

3627
04:18:04,159 --> 04:18:09,309
Hey, how many old viewers from like 2016, 2017?

3628
04:18:09,309 --> 04:18:10,110
Are you ready?

3629
04:18:10,110 --> 04:18:32,319
You ready for this?

3630
04:18:32,319 --> 04:18:32,959
It's back.

3631
04:18:42,239 --> 04:18:43,760
And the music's back, too.

3632
04:18:43,760 --> 04:18:49,040
Give you a little bit of channel nostalgia, right?

3633
04:18:49,040 --> 04:18:50,000
Before we go.

3634
04:18:50,000 --> 04:18:57,850
You know, it's really funny about this.

3635
04:18:58,409 --> 04:19:01,340
This is what's supposed to be every single end of the stream.

3636
04:19:02,360 --> 04:19:06,440
And I just didn't put the file in OBS.

3637
04:19:06,440 --> 04:19:07,799
I just had to drag it over here.

3638
04:19:08,360 --> 04:19:10,760
And it was just in a folder.

3639
04:19:10,760 --> 04:19:11,879
I just didn't do it.

3640
04:19:11,879 --> 04:19:16,780
But thanks for watching, everybody.

3641
04:19:17,340 --> 04:19:20,809
I would have liked to have gone for like another hour or so,

3642
04:19:20,809 --> 04:19:21,770
at least five hours or so.

3643
04:19:21,770 --> 04:19:25,049
But, you know, I got I got to beat the Internet.

3644
04:19:25,049 --> 04:19:30,120
So all streams, if I want to have five to six hour streams,

3645
04:19:30,120 --> 04:19:46,959
all streams until further notice have to start at between 12 and 1 Pacific.

3646
04:19:46,959 --> 04:19:49,020
So that's the plan.

3647
04:19:53,100 --> 04:19:54,219
Such a weird problem.

3648
04:19:54,219 --> 04:19:57,659
Because sometimes we'll be live at 7, 8 p.m.

3649
04:19:58,219 --> 04:19:59,500
without a single problem.

3650
04:19:59,500 --> 04:20:01,739
It's so weird because in like an hour or so,

3651
04:20:02,809 --> 04:20:05,450
I'll do a speed test and it'll just be a thousand, a thousand.

3652
04:20:06,090 --> 04:20:07,049
It's just so random.

3653
04:20:07,770 --> 04:20:09,440
You're moving the goalposts already.

3654
04:20:09,440 --> 04:20:09,920
No, no, no, no.

3655
04:20:10,559 --> 04:20:15,280
Between 12 and 1230 Pacific tomorrow is what I'm going to turn the stream on.

3656
04:20:15,280 --> 04:20:18,219
I actually felt pretty good today.

3657
04:20:18,219 --> 04:20:21,020
So I felt I'm glad that I was because I'll be honest,

3658
04:20:21,020 --> 04:20:23,100
during the among us stream, I might never really want to do that.

3659
04:20:24,280 --> 04:20:27,799
That was super important because that was a really fun kind of idea

3660
04:20:27,799 --> 04:20:29,000
just to do that one day.

3661
04:20:30,110 --> 04:20:32,909
But after that stream, that was middle of covid.

3662
04:20:32,909 --> 04:20:35,709
I was like, I, I got to go lie down.

3663
04:20:36,270 --> 04:20:41,920
See you at three.

3664
04:20:43,040 --> 04:20:44,239
No, I can't.

3665
04:20:44,239 --> 04:20:47,979
I can't start at three because that means that I'm giving myself a limit of

3666
04:20:49,440 --> 04:20:52,239
a large percent chance that it's going to be a four hour stream.

3667
04:20:52,239 --> 04:20:56,989
I got to pull it back to at least one because then it's guaranteed to be

3668
04:20:56,989 --> 04:21:00,190
at least a five to six hour stream before we hit that kind of period

3669
04:21:00,190 --> 04:21:01,870
at about seven o'clock, seven thirty.

3670
04:21:01,870 --> 04:21:10,000
But thanks for watching.

3671
04:21:10,559 --> 04:21:11,120
See you tomorrow.

3672
04:21:12,780 --> 04:21:13,579
Have a great night.

3673
04:21:14,139 --> 04:21:14,940
Thanks for sticking around.

3674
04:21:14,940 --> 04:21:15,500
See you soon.

3675
04:21:17,399 --> 04:21:18,600
More Sims 4 tomorrow.

3676
04:21:18,600 --> 04:21:21,399
I'll probably add a few mods, but I don't want to go crazy with it.

3677
04:21:21,959 --> 04:21:23,959
And I hold me to that.

3678
04:21:24,600 --> 04:21:25,399
No more cheating.

3679
04:21:26,040 --> 04:21:27,000
I wanted the lightsaber.

3680
04:21:27,000 --> 04:21:28,120
I know, but no more cheating.

3681
04:21:29,180 --> 04:21:31,020
Only slightly funny mods.

3682
04:21:31,739 --> 04:21:33,260
And I'm going to go on a snow trip tomorrow.

3683
04:21:33,260 --> 04:21:34,219
I want to go on a ski trip.

3684
04:21:34,780 --> 04:21:39,069
I'll see you later.

3685
04:21:39,069 --> 04:22:46,959
Have a good night, guys.
