00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:17,600
Hi. Welcome. Good to see you.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:34,899
Come on, I've got my Las Vegas hat on. I'm so drunk right now, you have no idea.

3
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:40,340
Hi everybody. Welcome to the stream. This is gonna be a very short stream.

4
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:50,579
Tiny. Like this big. Small. Delay Andy. That's me.

5
00:00:50,579 --> 00:01:00,640
It's gonna be a very compact one. I look so tired. I'm not used to waking up this early.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:10,069
You look young. I do?

7
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:17,980
Wait, is it the hat? I know why. It's because I used to wear hats. Like this. All the time.

8
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,859
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So now I look old again, right? Do I look old?

9
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,700
Shit. Alright, so let's put the hat back on and see what happens.

10
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:38,090
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay.

11
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,189
Wait. I can look even younger. Ready? Watch this. That's the trick.

12
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,819
You want to look younger? Just have your hat pointing up at the ceiling and have it rest on your head.

13
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,890
Now let's look older. Ready?

14
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:01,219
Hey. Hey, Sport. Oh, hey, Sport. How you doing?

15
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:06,180
Oh, hey. Yeah, I'm doing good. School's good.

16
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,669
School's doing good? That's good to know.

17
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,909
Hey, I got you a gift card to Target for this year.

18
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:18,430
A gift card to Target? Cool. Thanks, Uncle.

19
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,610
Yeah, of course. Of course. You can come visit Uncle anytime. Anytime you want, come to Uncle's.

20
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,419
I'll just fix it for you.

21
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:37,129
Redneck? No, that's, I mean, that's earnest. Yeah, this is earnest.

22
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:42,069
If you pull your hat way down on, like, your eyebrows, then you're just earnest.

23
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,550
And you know what I mean, Burn? Oh, no. Look at, no.

24
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,750
No, you can, you can, okay, you can see my crow's feet. You can see my cyberpunk augmentation.

25
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:02,800
Hold on. No. You can see my, like, cybernetics.

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:16,270
Oh, well. Anyways, there's a dog on the floor.

27
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:25,699
You know what's really funny about this dog? He, that's a nice dog bed. It really is.

28
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:32,009
But he doesn't give a shit. He's like, I don't care. What's on your face?

29
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:41,789
What is it? What is like this? What is this?

30
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,219
By the way, look at his outfit.

31
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,219
I've lost complete control at this point. You know what I mean?

32
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:51,219
Look at the hat. I've got, like, Dr. Favorite. I've got, like, pajamas on.

33
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:53,219
I've got, like, pajama pants.

34
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:59,960
I really am like a fucking 45-year-old.

35
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:08,060
That's how I dress. This is how I dress. People think I'm, hold on.

36
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,060
Come on. I've got to get away from earnest. We've got to go more, there we go.

37
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,379
There we go. Okay, cool.

38
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,550
Vegas Knights? Yeah, I've, I'm such a, I'm such a fucking piece of shit.

39
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,550
You know why?

40
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,300
How many Vegas Golden Knights games do you think I've been to since moving to Vegas?

41
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,790
How many? None. That's right. Correct. Ding, ding, ding.

42
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,660
Absolute zero. Turn it backwards.

43
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:51,970
Oh, wow. I just de-aged again.

44
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,750
This kind of hurts, though. This is fellow kids.

45
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,220
Yeah, it is. This hurts my forehead.

46
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,220
No, I don't like it. That reminds me of VR.

47
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,220
And I don't have very much left in the front, so I don't want to do that.

48
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:16,220
It reminds me of a VR helmet.

49
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
So, what are we doing today? Well, nothing.

50
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,220
I've got about 40 minutes.

51
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,220
I figured if we look at the dog, we'd have a coffee.

52
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,220
We'd talk about a few things. A few important things.

53
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,220
This is new, by the way. So it's not, I don't, you notice I haven't been punching you in the face on stream anymore?

54
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,139
You notice that I haven't been just, like, absolutely just hammering your head?

55
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,730
I used to have a big, one of these that was just stuck out and it was a big pop filter. Not anymore.

56
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,730
And now I have this little one that still works pretty well.

57
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,540
A couple things.

58
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:53,189
This weekend, probably on either, probably Monday, either Sunday or Monday,

59
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:57,189
I'm shooting for Monday or Tuesday. You know me, though. It'll be Thursday.

60
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,370
The poll for the New Year's Eve.

61
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,370
I'm not going to be live for the next, like, eight or nine days.

62
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,959
Probably ten days, at least.

63
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,199
So, I'm not going to be able to announce when the voting is going to happen.

64
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,870
But the nominations are in. That's closed.

65
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,870
And voting is going to begin this coming week.

66
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,560
And I'm not going to be able to tell you, hey, by the way, go vote!

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,860
I'm doing that now.

68
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,860
So, this is a preemptive go vote on that poll.

69
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,860
So, share this clip of me talking about this to all your friends that know that they want to vote,

70
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
because it's going to be coming next week.

71
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
And I'm not going to be there to tell you about it.

72
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
I'm here telling you about it now.

73
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,319
This is a loser. Loser.

74
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,439
Maybe I should get back to fucking punching shit.

75
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,620
Right there!

76
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,300
Uh, stop counting. Yeah, whatever. Get out of here.

77
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,439
Alright, so that's going to... I'll tweet it, yeah.

78
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,439
Look, who even follows me, really, on Twitter anymore?

79
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,439
I make one post every, like, four years.

80
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,319
Like, you're probably not paying that much attention to what happens on my Twitter.

81
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,629
It's like, hey, I'm streaming right now, and then three years go by,

82
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:13,629
and I do, like, a fucking... I'm in the bathroom, like, washing my hands tweet.

83
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:28,360
Where's the whopper? Ow! That hurt!

84
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:36,220
I don't have it. Shit!

85
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,220
I knew I was forgetting something.

86
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,939
Oh, well. Liar. I knew it!

87
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,939
I was like, what am I forgetting today?

88
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,939
This is something I'm fucking forgetting.

89
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:51,970
Go get it now. I can't go get it now.

90
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,970
I can't go get it now!

91
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:01,879
Dude, delivery. It's not even going to get here.

92
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,879
What do you mean, dude, do, like, door dash?

93
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,879
It's not going to get here in time.

94
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,439
It's going to take, like, 30 or 40 minutes for me to get...

95
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,540
It always does that.

96
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
It's not like it's going to take too long.

97
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
It's going to show up here, and the stream's going to end,

98
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
and I'm just going to enjoy a gross whopper,

99
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
but I don't want to do that.

100
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,019
You only have 30 minutes.

101
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,279
I do? Oh, somebody just said in all capitals,

102
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,220
fuck you.

103
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:43,809
Shit. I'm in trouble.

104
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,649
Okay. Well, I didn't do it.

105
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,649
And I'll do it when I get back.

106
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,659
I promise. Nice crow's feet.

107
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,659
No, it's a fucking goddamn cybernetic augmentation!

108
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:00,559
Gives me 10% better eyesight.

109
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:09,970
He's a redneck fat ass.

110
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,230
What?

111
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,009
I'm like a skinny boy.

112
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,269
I'm not a grown-up yet.

113
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,580
What do you mean, skinny?

114
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,779
You guys don't think I'm skinny?

115
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm like 150 pounds.

116
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,820
You are. I know.

117
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
I'm like 150, soaking wet.

118
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,879
Do the pancake recipe joke.

119
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,879
I don't have a gun.

120
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,879
I can't do a pancake recipe. I don't have a gun.

121
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,720
It's in a game.

122
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Look, I do a thing in the video game.

123
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Just look at the video.

124
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
It's called Secret Pancake Recipe.

125
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,429
I made it like fucking eight years ago.

126
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:07,899
Tell us your shitstain story.

127
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,440
Oh, also.

128
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Hey. Listen to this.

129
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
You guys ready?

130
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,059
I got an announcement to make.

131
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,750
I have an announcement to make for you.

132
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,500
So.

133
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Well, it's more like an announcement of an announcement.

134
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
But it's an announcement that

135
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
things are coming to this thing that people

136
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,000
were really into.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,070
So you guys remember FTK?

138
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,570
Fuck the king. A couple of experiments we tried to do.

139
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,570
Tried to get like a thousand people in a server.

140
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,570
It was an experiment, right?

141
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,570
It was an experiment. It was an experiment.

142
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,570
It was fun. It was an experiment.

143
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,570
It was fun. So.

144
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,570
FTK has been

145
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,860
killed. The king is dead.

146
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
And from the ashes

147
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,360
in the king's grave is going to

148
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,080
rise. You ready?

149
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,450
An official JermaCraft

150
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,450
server for Minecraft where you can go

151
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,450
and hang out with your friends and build all kinds of

152
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,450
fun stuff. And there's gonna be like a survival. There's gonna be like

153
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,450
a bunch of cool stuff. There's gonna be like a map you can

154
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,330
walk around. There's gonna be a full on community

155
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,330
Minecraft server that will

156
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,950
exist forever. It

157
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,830
looks fucking awesome. It's currently

158
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,330
a work in progress. It looks

159
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,019
awesome.

160
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,019
I will share some things with you soon.

161
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,220
But I wanted to give an update on that.

162
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,220
It's going to be, the base is going to be

163
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
just vanilla Minecraft.

164
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,590
There'll probably be some additions later

165
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,389
as we add stuff to it.

166
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:46,389
But FTK is just becoming

167
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,570
a Minecraft server. That you guys

168
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,570
it'll be broken up into a bunch of different

169
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,000
world maps and the hub world

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
looks incredible. I cannot

171
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
tell you how awesome it looks. You'll see pretty soon.

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,500
We just get subs?

173
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,990
MysticQuest, thanks for the five community

174
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,450
subs! That was really loud.

175
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,519
And like my chair shocked

176
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,549
me. Tuber voice. That wasn't even a tuber voice.

177
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,549
That was a chewing gum from the 90s

178
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:17,429
commercial voice. There's over 45

179
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:20,570
different flavors! Whoa!

180
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:26,460
Uh, Freddy's, what the fuck?

181
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,000
Freddy Dredge has

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
50 subs. The last two days has been like

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
just sub the, just like

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,500
sub the fuck out of me! That's

185
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,360
50! Freddy!

186
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,350
Oh my god, dude.

187
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,350
Cry, cry, cry, cry.

188
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,350
There's been like 2000 subs in

189
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,350
48 hours. Something insane.

190
00:12:51,350 --> 00:13:00,169
Sing the cry song.

191
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,169
How do you sing the cry song?

192
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:06,139
I don't know what that means.

193
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,590
He's in a new tax bracket.

194
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,889
Smash the hand.

195
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:17,509
Sing it, coward.

196
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,509
Come over here, coward. Come over here, coward.

197
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:25,080
Hey, you flipped me off.

198
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Uh, Jeremy, please.

199
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Give me some questions. Give me some questions for me

200
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
for like another 20 minutes before I leave.

201
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:41,049
No taxes on bits.

202
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:43,049
I don't think you know how that works.

203
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:48,549
But, it's okay.

204
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:50,730
Hold on a minute.

205
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,419
We've got another five

206
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:56,039
community subs!

207
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,039
From xparta45, thanks xparta.

208
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,039
This is just continuing from last night, I feel.

209
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,789
Hey, nice to see you. Nice to see you too.

210
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:08,679
Get that gross thing off there.

211
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,669
Do some ASMR, okay?

212
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:19,429
People are going to freak out if I do that.

213
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:25,769
This kind of looks like a pineapple upside down cake.

214
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:29,220
You know what I mean, doesn't it?

215
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Oh, no.

216
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
I'm literally sitting here

217
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,529
drinking coffee.

218
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,340
I don't deserve this amount of money.

219
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
I do not deserve this.

220
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
I've just made a coffee and put a fucking

221
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
Vegas Golden Knights hat on

222
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
and sat down and told you about a Minecraft server.

223
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,710
Somebody's like 25 subs.

224
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:55,179
Who was that?

225
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,179
Who just gave the 25 subs?

226
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,419
Four but just came in with five.

227
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,419
Who just gave 25 subs?

228
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:05,899
What the fuck is going on?

229
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,379
Is this going to turn off?

230
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,379
This is still going from last night.

231
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,899
Who just gave the 25?

232
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,289
Hold on.

233
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,289
Can I take a sip of this fucking coffee?

234
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,289
I'm just holding it like a wax museum.

235
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:29,750
Will the Minecraft server be sub only?

236
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,120
No, but you're going to have to get white listed.

237
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,679
You'll get white listed through the Discord.

238
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,679
So no one's going to have to pay

239
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,860
to play here.

240
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,159
But you're going to have to get white listed through the Discord.

241
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,159
So no, there's not going to be a sub

242
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,159
requirement at all. But there will be a Discord

243
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,100
white listing requirement.

244
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
No, I don't want people to have to pay for that.

245
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Every time I think about that, I'm like, no.

246
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
That's fucking stupid. I don't want to do that.

247
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Like, oh, you've got to have...

248
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Look, it's $5 a month to pay.

249
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
If I did that, let's say it was

250
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
$5 a month for you to play on that server

251
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
and you don't even care, you just want to play on the Minecraft server.

252
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,159
The hosting for that server,

253
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,360
it would be...

254
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
That would be way more money taking in

255
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
than I should be taking in.

256
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,990
So, no.

257
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,019
Why would I do that? My penis...

258
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,350
Whatever.

259
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,590
You should get a nose job.

260
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:33,929
You think so? Yeah, I know. It goes like this.

261
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,929
It's all broken and shit.

262
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:40,409
No, I don't care. It's how God made me. I don't give a fuck.

263
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:43,610
It's how God made me.

264
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,850
He started sketching.

265
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,279
He got about to be right here.

266
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,279
Somebody grabbed his attention.

267
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,279
God, there's an earthquake. What?

268
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,279
And he smudged with his pencil.

269
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,279
I'll fix that later.

270
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,710
He got down to here.

271
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,710
He sneezed. Oh, shit.

272
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,710
That's all right. That's how I made him.

273
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,960
That's how it looks okay.

274
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,710
Then he got to about here.

275
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,710
And he's like, you know what?

276
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,710
Let's make a big mouth.

277
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,710
I was his funny character creator.

278
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:26,440
You don't think God made you into a character creator?

279
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,089
Listen to this at work.

280
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:32,089
Be careful. I don't want you to get fired or anything.

281
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,710
Get out of work.

282
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,779
I don't want your boss to come over and be like, what the fuck is this guy?

283
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:42,650
Oh, shit. Hey, bro.

284
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,400
I got the report.

285
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
You're doing a great job, man.

286
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,880
I'm working here.

287
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
You really helped me out here.

288
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,440
You did a huge thing for me.

289
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
I'm working here, remote.

290
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,869
You're there.

291
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,869
The work that I have for you

292
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:03,180
will be done soon.

293
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,180
You've helped me way more than I do.

294
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,380
You do so much more work than me.

295
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
I'm just really happy that I have somebody like you that I can kind of

296
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,380
communicate with that can help me

297
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,819
get work done for the boss.

298
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:18,569
Because he's like fucking...

299
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:20,869
He sucks.

300
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,940
He is such a fucking loser.

301
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
I know you guys, I know you like him.

302
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,940
You like him and you think he's really cool

303
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,940
and smart and funny and stuff.

304
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
He fucking sucks, dude.

305
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,940
And I don't even care if I get like, I don't know.

306
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,890
If he ever hears this, whatever.

307
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,890
Which is like, I find fucking annoying.

308
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,279
But, whatever.

309
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:49,059
I don't think he's an idiot.

310
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,059
You got that guy fired.

311
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,559
No I didn't. The boss is peering over with like

312
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,559
his glasses looking down.

313
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,559
And he hears like, oh you like him.

314
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,559
And I'm like, fuck him.

315
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,400
He stands up for me?

316
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,880
I don't remember that.

317
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
This is a stall stream.

318
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,779
There's nothing to stall to.

319
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:23,109
Are you Ellis from Left 4 Dead?

320
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:27,269
Oh shit. I mean, a little.

321
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:31,750
Stall 2 for the Whopper stream.

322
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,980
This is one.

323
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,980
Do the voice.

324
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,410
What does Ellis talk like?

325
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,410
Oh man, that's me Ellis. I'm hanging out here with my gun.

326
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,079
I don't know nothing about that.

327
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:54,549
Is that how he talks?

328
00:19:54,549 --> 00:20:05,430
I haven't played the game in like fucking 4 years.

329
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,430
What about Community Content Night?

330
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,430
Oh alright, we can talk about that.

331
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,430
So, Community Content Night is

332
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,099
like FTK, also dead.

333
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,299
Sad to say.

334
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:22,759
The reason is because the Twitch DMCA

335
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,579
shit, there is no reliable way

336
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,579
I can show videos like that on stream

337
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:30,329
in a row.

338
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,819
Unfortunately, all the

339
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:35,130
best like possibilities

340
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,619
like in Harry Potter,

341
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,440
you know, think about it, right?

342
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
I sat in front of a green screen and said, put this in the Saw

343
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,000
movie. Hey look, I'm a

344
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Harry Potter character.

345
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,430
You can't really do that anymore.

346
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,250
And I don't want to have

347
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,250
insane heavy restrictions on it because I feel like

348
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,250
the best videos are when you guys do whatever the fuck you want.

349
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,490
So I wouldn't want to be like,

350
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,490
it's going to be the original background, original music,

351
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,490
only original character, and only

352
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,490
like an original foreground, and

353
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,730
good luck. By the way,

354
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,730
I say Harry Potter in this clip 35

355
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,970
times. Good luck.

356
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,910
No idea how you're going to do that.

357
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,660
So that's just not going to happen anymore.

358
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
And it's sad to say it,

359
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,420
but that was

360
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
about a full half of those streams.

361
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,849
So, the idea,

362
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:28,859
and I don't know,

363
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,480
I think this is okay for me to say,

364
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
the idea is maybe to make a mega playlist

365
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,490
with the videos.

366
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,049
A huge one, a mega one.

367
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,250
And queue it up in the Discord

368
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,250
and just have a night where

369
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,250
we just, in the Discord, it's just playing

370
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,619
and we're all there. Somehow.

371
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:50,980
I'm trying to figure out what to do about it.

372
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
Kind of like a watch party, essentially,

373
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,990
in Discord. Because we can't do it

374
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,509
here. And I don't really want to do it on YouTube

375
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:01,509
either because YouTube also has the same problems.

376
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,509
And I don't really want to stream on YouTube because

377
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:06,200
I don't want to do that.

378
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,079
What the fuck is a Discord?

379
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,079
It's a service where you can get online and talk to friends.

380
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,450
It's like Skype, but way better.

381
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,450
It's just a way better version of

382
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:23,109
Skype. There you go.

383
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,109
Disc or mega lol. Okay, whatever.

384
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:27,109
But the artwork is

385
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:29,109
essentially started to transition into

386
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,480
the BRB screen. And I know there's

387
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,779
some kinks to work out.

388
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:35,779
There's things that we have to figure out how I'm going to do that.

389
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:38,220
Because I think

390
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,220
after talking to Lazy Luke

391
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,839
that the backlog of art

392
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,839
is still slowly

393
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,839
getting chipped away at.

394
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,839
And I would have to do more

395
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:51,769
BRBs. But

396
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,140
I don't know if I necessarily want to do that.

397
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
I don't think I want to have to be like,

398
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,309
I gotta take a break now.

399
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:00,309
Because if I don't take a break now, let's

400
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:02,309
do a five minute break. I'll see you later so we can show art.

401
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,549
Although

402
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,009
I could do it at the end of streams.

403
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:10,009
But the problem with doing it at the end of a stream is

404
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:12,009
I am doing the thing that I deliberately

405
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:14,440
removed like four or five months ago.

406
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Where we hang out and sit there

407
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
for half an hour,

408
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
twenty, fifteen, twenty, thirty, forty minutes.

409
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
And we do a post stream wind down and I got rid of that

410
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,750
deliberately. So that's not going to happen.

411
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,119
So what could happen

412
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,549
is during, I guess,

413
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,549
I could do either like an art

414
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,789
stream. But the thing about

415
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,789
doing an art stream is that's just

416
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,789
community content night. And community content night had the videos

417
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:40,789
and it was like a big thing. It was like, oh we're going to do the art.

418
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,789
Then we're going to do the videos, we're going to do the music.

419
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,029
And it just sucks

420
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,980
that we can't do it all. Could do pre-stream too.

421
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,150
There could be a thing

422
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,150
during the planets, right?

423
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,150
Where it's

424
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,150
and then in the corner for like, you know, five to ten minutes

425
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,150
is, or like big enough obviously

426
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,650
the starting soon would be in the corner.

427
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,650
Do that. Have it run during the starting soon screen.

428
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,589
I think that makes sense too.

429
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:09,690
He's flustered. A little because it's

430
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,690
annoying that I have to, I have to

431
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,690
remove and delete essentially one of my favorite things

432
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,859
on the entire channel. Which was like the

433
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:17,859
screen screen community, not content night stuff.

434
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,859
Like that shit was fucking hilarious.

435
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,789
So it's annoying that

436
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:25,480
one of my favorite things essentially has to go away.

437
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,640
I just rambled for a little while

438
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
but you know I haven't talked, we have not talked about this yet.

439
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,980
So, do it on YouTube. Yeah

440
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,980
I don't want to do it on YouTube. No.

441
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,339
The same problems. I like the rambling.

442
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:49,539
Well good. I'm glad. Cheers to you.

443
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,130
I don't know why I did that. That probably hurt.

444
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,130
I'm really sorry. I just like did that inside of your ear.

445
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:05,859
Ramble Andy.

446
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:14,700
Go to mixer. That's funny.

447
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Go back to gaslighting.

448
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,599
You want to see the dog again? Oh what I was going to say about the dog.

449
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,900
So he pulls the blankets off

450
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
and lies over on next to the bed sometimes.

451
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,210
It's like he prefers

452
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,210
he's such a Goldilocks dog. Sometimes he

453
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,829
prefers a soft bed.

454
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:33,829
And other times he prefers like a hard

455
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:36,579
ground. It's 50-50.

456
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:38,579
I have no idea. He sees Goldilocks.

457
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,579
No, no. He's the Goldilocks bears.

458
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,819
All in one animal. That's more accurate.

459
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:45,509
So

460
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:48,200
anybody got any more questions?

461
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,079
This is just a question stream. I'll answer anything.

462
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:53,900
I will answer anything.

463
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
You could write anything. As long as it was

464
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,900
TOS friendly. I would answer literally any question.

465
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,609
What is it? What's your name? Jeremy.

466
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:04,299
Done. Easy. Will you marry me? No.

467
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,250
Do I

468
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,250
poop? Of course I do.

469
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,250
That's part of my digestive system. All humans

470
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,670
do, of course. Can I have? No.

471
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,670
How's your day? It's going pretty good. It's going well.

472
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,509
It's going very good. Will I make it through my audit?

473
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:26,519
Yeah, just make sure

474
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,950
you play by the rules and make sure you give

475
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,130
all the documents and

476
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,130
work with the IRS.

477
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,690
You can work with the IRS somehow.

478
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:41,259
Yeah, you'll be good. Do you drink Dr.

479
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:43,259
Pepper? I have not had a sip of Dr. Pepper

480
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:45,259
in probably four or five months.

481
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:47,940
Before that it was probably a couple of years.

482
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,940
I just wear it because I like the shirt.

483
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,099
I'm an old fan.

484
00:26:54,099 --> 00:27:00,569
Pirates, knights, or cowboys?

485
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:03,180
Pirates for fun, knights for protection,

486
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,180
and cowboys for...

487
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:13,240
No, this is not

488
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,670
like a sexual thing. What are you talking about?

489
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,299
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

490
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,299
Pirates are like... If I was on a pirate ship

491
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,299
it would be like we sing songs and like drink

492
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:24,660
and sail.

493
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,099
A knight has like a huge...

494
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:29,099
can protect you. He's got like a sword and a shield

495
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,720
and stuff. A cowboy...

496
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,599
for food! A cowboy

497
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,599
for food. If I want to have

498
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,599
a lot of food. Is there like... they can

499
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,569
get... they're cowboys, right?

500
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,569
I don't know. Farmers? Cowboys? They're kind of...

501
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:47,000
Cowboys used to have their own

502
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
source of food. They had to get their hunt and stuff, right?

503
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,500
They're not eating other cowboys.

504
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,279
Do you... What's your favorite... What?

505
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,349
Do you eat beans? I do.

506
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:06,920
Refried beans are one of my favorite things. Any news

507
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
on the D&D game? Star

508
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
is currently working on his project

509
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,099
which is going very well.

510
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,099
So we had a conversation that was just like, hey, whenever

511
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,460
you're... Just you do your project

512
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
and do it as best you can and then maybe later

513
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460
you'll be able to get heavy, heavy

514
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,460
work on the German 951.

515
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,730
So he's got his thing

516
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,730
going now. And I don't want to... I didn't want to be like

517
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,730
oh, hey, well, fuck it. You're gonna do mine.

518
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,730
Forget about your project. No, it's

519
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,569
going very well, so... Do I smell?

520
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:39,579
Yeah. Do I smell bad? No.

521
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,579
I do... I emanate some type of fragrance

522
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:52,059
though. What's your opinion? I missed it.

523
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,640
Fucking door spring behind you.

524
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,119
This thing? I would even pick

525
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:07,420
that up. Touch it. Go flick

526
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:19,690
it. Okay, fine.

527
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,960
You happy? You made a loud

528
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:34,579
noise too. I forgot.

529
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:36,579
You can't... Like on Twitch

530
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,579
you have to just be a torso.

531
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:41,019
You cannot... People cannot know

532
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,019
that you have anything below the torso.

533
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,700
See, and now Otto's annoyed. I just

534
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
like... I just did that thing and he's like

535
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
fucking... What the fuck, dude? I was sleeping.

536
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,740
You did that. I didn't.

537
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,740
You have to just be a floating

538
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,200
upper body. When's German Rumble 2020?

539
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,500
New Year's Eve. Oh, hello.

540
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,220
New Year's Eve. Why do I look like a college

541
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,220
kid? Because I have a hat on. You want me to take it off and

542
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,549
be Jeremy again? Sure.

543
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,549
Alright. I'm just gonna... Whatever. I don't even need the hat anymore. Who cares?

544
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:20,619
Boomer. Maybe

545
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:26,119
a little. Your hair looks small.

546
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:40,650
It's... I was trying to hold in

547
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,650
a fart right there and I promise I wasn't. I just was

548
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:48,859
doing that. I don't know why. Do a wink.

549
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,859
That was Robert De Niro.

550
00:30:50,859 --> 00:31:00,630
I don't think... Easiest impression

551
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,630
ever. Just like crush your face a little bit

552
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:09,349
and tilt your head around. Any chance

553
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:11,349
of... I missed it. What does it say? Any chance of...

554
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:14,789
Any chance of... When are you

555
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,309
gonna collab with Nianers? What the fuck was

556
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,740
that? When am I gonna collab with Nianers?

557
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,750
Nianers is... Nianers is very funny.

558
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,569
I don't know.

559
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:28,569
I don't know. We kind of did last night.

560
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:30,569
We were like sent the

561
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:33,059
clip thing.

562
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:40,940
We like sent... We went back and forth with like clips

563
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,200
on stream. Mind playing Jet Set

564
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Radio for a stream? I did and I fucking couldn't

565
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
do it. I like couldn't do it. I freaked

566
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:56,329
out. Do a slime stream. I know.

567
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:58,329
There's so many things that I want to do but I

568
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:02,420
just didn't. You gonna be a VTuber?

569
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,430
Would I make a good VTuber?

570
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,799
I don't know. Probably not.

571
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:20,259
Christmas stream.

572
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:23,079
Not this year. New Year's stream.

573
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:27,819
Uh...

574
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:31,849
Nianers believed you could do it.

575
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,789
Well that's a huge endorsement.

576
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:37,539
What would I... How would I... I don't

577
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:44,579
know. What about German Direct?

578
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:48,279
Um...

579
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,279
I don't have much to show besides the New Year's Eve

580
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,460
thing and the Minecraft thing. It'd be like

581
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,460
a Blizzcon 2019.

582
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,170
People would be fucking mad at me.

583
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,170
Oh! But shit I gotta charge like $400

584
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:10,920
a ticket though. Will you... What does it say?

585
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,299
If you do Mr. Slime, let me

586
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:18,299
do it. Um... I have no

587
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,299
idea what I would even do.

588
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,299
I would have to get like a... I would have to like get

589
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,299
something blocked out of my brain first before

590
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,299
I even took that step. But somebody

591
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:29,500
just gave a shitload of money.

592
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
That was Chef Lazarus for 25

593
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
subs. So many subs.

594
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
I think... I think we broke it. Did we break it?

595
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:42,140
Let's see. Uh... I think we broke...

596
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:51,420
I think it's an all time high. Let's see.

597
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,230
I think we did it. When I

598
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,230
say we I mean you because like

599
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,230
I'm just receiving this and

600
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,859
sometimes I don't know why. Uh...

601
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:03,289
The channel has broken.

602
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,619
11,000 subscribers.

603
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:08,619
Just fucking ridiculous.

604
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:10,619
Uh... I believe the all

605
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,429
time high is

606
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:16,889
not very close to... I don't know. I don't like

607
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,889
keep track of this if I'm honest.

608
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,130
I don't like want to keep track of this

609
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,130
because I feel like then it becomes

610
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,130
something I have to care about and I don't want that.

611
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,619
So I don't really pay

612
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,619
that much attention to that.

613
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:32,179
So that's a lot

614
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:36,019
of fucking money. He doesn't care about

615
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:38,019
gift subs. No, I do. I very much

616
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:40,019
do. But I don't ever want that

617
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:42,019
to be like a number that I like

618
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:46,380
chase every day. And it's fluctuated

619
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
a lot. I mean it's gone.

620
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,380
It's... It has gone like wham

621
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,679
wham. My schedule is so erratic.

622
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,679
I take a lot of breaks. I don't pay attention

623
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,679
to that. If it ha... Again this is...

624
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,679
I said the word subscriber and we talked about all

625
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,300
I shouldn't have even said it. But this

626
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
is a lot of money and I just don't want

627
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,570
to pay that much attention to it. Um...

628
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,809
Chef Lazarus... I can't...

629
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,809
Somebody just gave 50. Hold on. I gotta pull this up.

630
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:16,679
That's a lot of money.

631
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:19,429
How much... What did you just give?

632
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:21,429
That was Wesley. Wesley gave 50

633
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:24,889
community subs.

634
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,889
We broke it. We definitely broke it.

635
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,889
So we don't have to do anymore.

636
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,960
It's absolutely been broken.

637
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
The stream is absolutely... This is the new subscriber

638
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,389
high. Last time it happened

639
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:39,340
was like this exact time

640
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:44,070
period last year. That's

641
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:49,449
insane. End of December into the

642
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,449
first of January. That's what happened last time.

643
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,389
But thanks guys. It's completely

644
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:56,389
unnecessary. We don't have... You don't have

645
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,389
to give anymore subs. We don't have to do it anymore.

646
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,389
Like you don't have to. This is like

647
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:02,570
already an insane number. And

648
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,639
we don't have to do like a

649
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,639
sub train today. We don't have to do

650
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,639
that. That doesn't have to happen.

651
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,070
It doesn't have to happen.

652
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,070
I don't need it to happen. I don't like want

653
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,070
you to do that. I know

654
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,070
that I'm just... I keep saying the word

655
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,889
so people are going to do it. But I

656
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,639
will tell you, if you have

657
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,610
other streamers that you watch,

658
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,610
I would rather you

659
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,610
sub to them. I would rather you

660
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,610
support a smaller streamer

661
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,610
or a streamer that you enjoy

662
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,610
that you know might not have 11

663
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,039
fucking thousand subscriptions.

664
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,159
You know what I'm saying? It's

665
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,159
an incredibly overwhelming thing.

666
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,159
I can't believe that this many people pay this much

667
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:49,659
money. But if you have a

668
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:52,969
choice between like a few

669
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,969
different people and you know that I'm about to

670
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:57,590
hit like fucking 12,000 subs,

671
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,900
support them. Because you know that I

672
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,570
would much prefer that. If you don't,

673
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:09,239
but if it's just me, if it's just

674
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,739
me, then alright. But no, I'm kidding.

675
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:17,159
He's doing

676
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,530
reverse psychology. Alright, well then

677
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,699
okay. If I do regular

678
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:23,699
regular psychology,

679
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,070
if I say do it, then that

680
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:34,710
means you won't do it. There's a burp coming in.

681
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,150
I can't even

682
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,150
count. This is so many that just came in. All

683
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,150
five. Five fifty. Ten

684
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,150
from Captain Dark. Five edgy shadow.

685
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,150
Five anonymous gifted. This is the same exact thing

686
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,539
happened yesterday. Now, and I want

687
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:53,829
another thing too. Especially

688
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,829
like now. You know

689
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,969
what I mean? Like 2020's been fucked. I'd rather

690
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:00,969
you spend that money on like you, your friends, and

691
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:04,469
your family than me.

692
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:06,469
Take care of yourselves. Make sure you do that first.

693
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:08,469
Put me at the bottom of your fucking list.

694
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:12,099
I really hope you are. Put me

695
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:14,099
at the very bottom of your list of

696
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,239
places where you think your money should be going.

697
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,239
Take care of yourself. Take care of your family. Take care of your friends.

698
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:23,530
Absolutely. Like I

699
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,530
It's been a fucking rough year. And I

700
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,900
really hope that you guys

701
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:36,460
are taking care of yourselves. Ban the subs.

702
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,260
Jeremy, you're getting coal for

703
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:51,099
Christmas.

704
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:54,230
Are you gonna finish Saw II? Why would

705
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,230
I finish Saw II?

706
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,230
Did you hear how much I was

707
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,230
not having fun in that game?

708
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:04,900
I'm not gonna finish. I'm not gonna

709
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
open Saw II again. I don't know what the

710
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,320
disk is. I think I threw it away.

711
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,900
Yes. Yeah.

712
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,280
But that's behind you?

713
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:34,739
I know. There's a dog behind me.

714
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,739
Here he comes.

715
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:38,920
Oh, big stretch.

716
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,760
You missed it.

717
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
I really hate to do this

718
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
but I've gotta go in like

719
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,639
a minute. I think I'm just gonna

720
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,639
turn the stream on and

721
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,639
hey everybody. Just going

722
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,639
live for like 40 minutes and collecting

723
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:58,329
subs. Thanks everybody. Appreciate

724
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,329
the fucking 600 subs

725
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:02,329
that just came in. Alright, see you later

726
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:04,760
40 minutes. You know what I'm saying?

727
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,239
You know what I mean? I wanna be real. I don't

728
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,239
want that. I don't want to be that.

729
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,239
I don't want this to turn into

730
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,239
that. I don't want to just collect money from you

731
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,760
and that's what I do.

732
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,369
Let me be real. Farming

733
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:32,519
subs. Where is German

734
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,230
land? It's coming soon.

735
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,659
That's like what just happened.

736
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:40,659
I turned the stream on to give you a couple of updates

737
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:42,659
and say have a good holiday.

738
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:44,659
If you celebrate Christmas, have a great Christmas. Whatever holiday

739
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,659
you're celebrating, happy holidays, right?

740
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:49,030
Merry Christmas to all that. Cause I'm not

741
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,530
gonna be here. I mean I just

742
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,530
got like a bunch of money.

743
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,530
Okay, I'm gonna update them and

744
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,530
yeah, I guess I'll collect

745
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,530
like fucking thousands of dollars.

746
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,019
You got crusty

747
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:07,320
lips? How about now?

748
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,460
Better? I know I have dry lips.

749
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,460
You know what? Fucking

750
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,460
mod that guy for five minutes and then

751
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,460
fucking throw his username

752
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,460
into the trash can

753
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
with all the other banned motherfuckers.

754
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,179
And then

755
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:31,139
throw him a life vest.

756
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:33,139
And take a huge smoke of

757
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:35,139
cigar.

758
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,199
Good luck getting back to land.

759
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,199
And then drop a briefcase

760
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,199
into the

761
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,199
huge briefcase into the fucking water.

762
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,199
And there's like 20 grand and hundreds in there.

763
00:41:48,199 --> 00:42:00,679
Just fuck it up.

764
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,679
You know what I mean? Like wait, is he trying to kill me?

765
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,679
He's trying to give me money?

766
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,679
I don't understand what he's doing.

767
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:09,940
There's like a Lyft waiting for them?

768
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,039
Yeah, I'm taking you wherever you want to go.

769
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:18,500
Why? I don't know.

770
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Mr. Green told me to do this.

771
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
I have no idea. He gave me $500

772
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
and said take him wherever he wants.

773
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:38,699
10k viewers? What would it look like

774
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:51,239
without lips? How do you do that?

775
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:57,829
Yeah. I can't get it to work.

776
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:01,159
Disgusting.

777
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:06,280
Oh, did you know that I was the Joker?

778
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:16,380
Stop. It was just Elmo.

779
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,190
The Joker kind of

780
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:23,219
is an Elmo laugh. It is.

781
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:25,219
You can't tell me that's not Elmo.

782
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:31,179
It's close.

783
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:33,179
It's in the line of

784
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:37,909
different Elmo laughs.

785
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:39,909
You don't go

786
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,909
hahahaha.

787
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:43,909
No. Who does a Joker laugh like that?

788
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:45,909
Everybody's Joker laugh is like extreme

789
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:47,909
and they throw their head

790
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:49,909
forward and they get a high pitch at the end.

791
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:54,710
It's Elmo.

792
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,710
Yeah, but that's different though.

793
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:03,239
Nobody does

794
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:05,239
the Joker laugh like

795
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:07,239
hahahaha. I am the Joker.

796
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:09,239
No. They all go

797
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:15,190
I don't know why we do that. Everyone does it

798
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,010
like that. Nobody does it the other way.

799
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:25,110
It was like 50 faces.

800
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,420
You need a Netflix special.

801
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,119
What the fuck would I even do?

802
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,119
You're going to be late? I'm not going to. I'm okay.

803
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:42,260
You got a link? Let's see.

804
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,760
Whole VTuber stream.

805
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,760
A VTuber face tracking program is not difficult

806
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,760
to get. Do it. What did you get? What is this?

807
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:56,380
Explain the toothbrush behind you.

808
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:08,389
Where? What?

809
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:14,789
There's your toothbrush. On the bottom shelf.

810
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:20,230
The fuck did you even see

811
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,789
that? How?

812
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:26,550
What? I don't know

813
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,550
why that's there. I have no idea.

814
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:37,320
I don't know why that's there.

815
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,320
I must have been

816
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,320
like, I don't know.

817
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,320
It must have been in my hand. I'm not a

818
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
weirdo. I promise. I don't know why there's a toothbrush

819
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
there. But I kind of need

820
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
it. So that's really good that

821
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,320
you saw that because I wouldn't have

822
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,389
seen it. It's in its case.

823
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:56,389
It's fine. I can't believe you saw that.

824
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:59,780
Explain it. I don't

825
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,019
know how to explain that.

826
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:06,699
How do you explain that? You don't.

827
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:08,699
Use it right now. No. I need it.

828
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,539
Brush your teeth. I do brush

829
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:14,539
my teeth. It's not right the second I'm

830
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:19,780
busy doing this. Unbox

831
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:25,420
it. No. That's

832
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,420
so fucking funny that somebody saw that.

833
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,590
Like, how?

834
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,590
People just like take every fucking

835
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,590
pixel and they go, what's over there?

836
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,590
What's over there? What's that thing right there? Is that

837
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,590
embarrassing? Let's find out. What's that?

838
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,590
Is that lotion? Is that lotion right here?

839
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,590
Jeremy, why do I have lotion? Why is there lotion there?

840
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,590
Are you zirking off? You must be zirking off.

841
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,590
Jeremy, why do I have lotion? Are you zirking off? You zirked off today.

842
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,019
No, I don't know why that's there. No, I know you

843
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:50,019
zirked off. I know it. I know it.

844
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:52,019
I know you did. You do. I know you do.

845
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:54,969
Okay, cool. Why is that?

846
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:56,969
What's in that box? The box behind you.

847
00:46:56,969 --> 00:46:59,340
The box behind me? Yeah. What's it?

848
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,090
Was there lotion in there? Inside the box, like the cardboard box

849
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,090
over here. Yeah, you must have been zirking off in that box.

850
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,090
I don't zirk off in a box.

851
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,090
I don't. Yes, you do. Why is it behind you in your bedroom?

852
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,519
Because, I don't know, it's packing something.

853
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:12,519
Okay, yeah, right, there's lotion in there. You zirked off in that box. I know you did.

854
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:15,340
You fucking liar. I know you zirked off.

855
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,639
Everything has to do with that. You-

856
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:20,010
Why is the toothbrush there? What's the explanation

857
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,010
for that? I don't have one. You must be

858
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,010
fucking using that. On your butt.

859
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,010
You're like fucking butthole. No, I'm

860
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,010
not, actually. Oh, yeah? Yeah.

861
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,010
No, you zirked off and used that thing on your butthole.

862
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,570
I know you were. No, I'm not, okay?

863
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:40,440
Like, I'm not. It all

864
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,440
goes back to that every time.

865
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,659
No one said that? Oh, I'm sure

866
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:50,760
they did. You're projecting.

867
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,300
I thought there was a device-

868
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,210
Ow! I'm just saying,

869
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,639
it doesn't matter what's behind you,

870
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:03,639
if you're a YouTuber

871
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:05,880
or you're in a streamer room,

872
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,880
the thing that's not really supposed

873
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,380
to be in the room is

874
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,380
you must have been zirking off somehow.

875
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:28,170
It's every time.

876
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,170
Shut the door. This door is

877
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,010
shut. What are you talking about?

878
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,010
You're in a beatbox to meet the medic theme.

879
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,179
No, why?

880
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:40,869
I've done it like a thousand times.

881
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:42,869
Close it all the way. I will eventually

882
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:52,090
when I feel like it. Play with the

883
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,090
door spring to remove one million off the

884
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:57,030
dead. I already did. I did that already.

885
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,400
You missed it. I did that for free.

886
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,989
Alright. I gotta

887
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:05,989
get out of here. I have to leave.

888
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:07,989
I'm not gonna see you guys until next

889
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,420
week. Uh, probably like

890
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,730
I might- I might

891
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,730
even see you on New Year's

892
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,030
Eve. That might be the next time you physically

893
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,789
see me. Uh, I got a lot

894
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:22,789
of work to do. I've got a lot of stuff going on

895
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:24,789
and I'll be gone until

896
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:26,789
that week of New Year's Eve.

897
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:29,159
So, I didn't want- I wanted to stream

898
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:31,159
and I've been taking a lot of time off, I know

899
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:33,159
and that's why I feel even more like

900
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:35,159
just bad about taking

901
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:37,159
like thousands of subs

902
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:39,159
before it's like, well, see you later.

903
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:41,159
I'll see you like 12 days.

904
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:44,789
Um, but thanks

905
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,969
guys. We'll have fun on New Year's Eve.

906
00:49:46,969 --> 00:49:48,969
A lot of festivities.

907
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:52,619
And, uh, I'll see you guys later.

908
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:55,289
We're not even gonna have an outro.

909
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:58,739
I'm just going. I'm just going.

910
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:00,739
No outro, no nothing. I didn't start with

911
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:07,340
one, I'm not gonna end with one.

912
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,829
Didn't start one, not gonna end with one.

913
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:11,829
Raid- Oh! You know who's live right now?

914
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:13,829
Who I never catch live because we're in different time

915
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:16,260
zones? Is, uh, RT.

916
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,079
RT Game Crowd's live right now.

917
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,079
Never catch him because we're just so far apart

918
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:23,320
in time zones.

919
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,420
So let's raid RT.

920
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,489
Absolutely. Okay.

921
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,489
Uh, I'll see you guys. I'll give you updates.

922
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:34,489
I'll be in the Discord. I'll be popping around.

923
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,099
Uh, but, I gotta make this really clear.

924
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:39,460
Make sure that you

925
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,460
keep an eye on the Discord over the next

926
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,460
like three or four days. Because the

927
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,460
poll, the voting of the actual awards

928
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,460
for your nominations that you've

929
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,460
nominated is gonna be there. I'll tweet

930
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,460
about it, it'll be in the Discord, but I'm not gonna be able to

931
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,150
talk about it until I'm back.

932
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,889
So, good night. Oh, well, it's like

933
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,260
no, it's like noon. Well, it's

934
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,260
noon somewhere. It's noon

935
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,880
somewhere, right? Whatever that thing is.

936
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,309
Yeah. I'll see you guys in like a week.

937
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:09,429
Take care of yourselves. Enjoy the rest of your

938
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:12,679
evening. Day, night, whatever.

939
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,199
It's noon here. It's noon here too. And I'll

940
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,199

941
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:20,199

944
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:26,199
that you will have, uh, hopefully on like

945
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:28,199
Christmas and Christmas Eve and New Year's and stuff.

946
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:32,280
We're gonna have fun. Goodbye. Take care

947
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,840
