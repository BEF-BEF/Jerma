1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:16,469
We're gonna, I'm gonna open Viscera. Viscera got a new level. Really? Okay, so, uh,

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,059
Amid Evil, we are probably gonna, we're gonna stop here from Amid Evil. We're gonna move on

3
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:28,629
to Viscera Cleanup, but I like this game. You will probably end up seeing this game again.

4
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,649
Nah, Viscera, um, Viscera's pretty fun, but I don't think, I fucked it up. I said the wrong game.

5
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,840
I was trying to do like, nevermind, fuck it, I just said the wrong thing. I was gonna say, like,

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,880
it's, like, pretend it's been like two weeks, and like, I'm never playing this game again.

7
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:58,890
I said the wrong game. Just pretend like I made something funny happen. I was trying to get the

8
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:06,180
music queued up, too. Oh well. All right, we're gonna play Viscera Cleanup Detail. Merry Christmas,

9
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:22,019
everybody. What, what's the new level called? I already did the Christmas level. Do I even

10
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:41,079
have this game installed? I do. Is it just on the base, Viscera Cleanup Detail? Or is, do I have to

11
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,680
buy it? Do I actually have to buy it? What's it called? Here, just put the BRB on for you.

12
00:01:45,319 --> 00:02:05,689
Is it, it's like DLC? Oh, okay. Would it be on a DLC? House of Horror the Vulcan Affair.

13
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:17,990
I've already, I've done this. Is it a separate video game, not DLC?

14
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:28,360
Is it not called Visceral Cubes? Have you done the Vulcan Affair? I don't even remember.

15
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:45,129
Have I? What is the Vulcan Affair? They're just debating you. All right, well, fuck it,

16
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:53,110
we'll just open up, we'll open up one of them. I'm the god of so excited for the stream.

17
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:12,629
Uh, I don't think I've done the Vulcan Affair. How big is this one? It's spy themed? This is the

18
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:23,139
newest one. All right, well, fuck it, whatever, I'll try it. Your account already owns this game.

19
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:45,400
Oh, how? What? I don't have it listed here. I don't own this. You already own this game.

20
00:03:48,419 --> 00:04:00,409
What? It's not in my library. Viscera Cleanup Detail, Santa's Rampage, and then Shadow Warrior.

21
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:21,899
I don't have this. It's just DLC on the base game. Let's just open it. Should I launch 64-bit or

22
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:35,800
play, just play it normally? I haven't played this in a long time. I don't remember. All right,

23
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:46,060
let's go. Hey, and the title doesn't even need to change. That could, that still makes sense.

24
00:04:46,060 --> 00:05:11,850
All right, hold on. Switch game, DLC. The Vulcan Affair. I don't even own this. All right, hold on.

25
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:19,209
Wait, wait, wait, FOV 90, windowed mode. Nope. 1920 by 1080, windowed mode, turn it off.

26
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:29,529
Okay, gamma, 0.75, FOV 90, view bob, get it out of here. Dynamic shadows, sure.

27
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:37,990
Environmental shadows, I guess. Sure, motion blur, get it out of here. Bloom, who wants that?

28
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:45,670
Light shafts, nobody wants those either. Anti-aliasing, times two. Antroscopic filtering,

29
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:59,300
four. Ambient occlusion, get that out of here. It's ugly. Expensive particles, sure. Okay. Oh,

30
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:16,920
I think it crashed. Did it? Yeah. Too many expensive particles. I don't know where to get it. Hold on.

31
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:27,050
All right, there it is. Start assignment. It's a little, it's kind of loud.

32
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,850
Audio, sound, master down to 50, effects, music, ambient, that's whatever, that's fine.

33
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:48,629
Start. I would like to play solo. Save file, game type, clean up, work site, the Vulcan Affair,

34
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:56,980
okay. Game rules, I know how this works. Disable the sniffer, time limit, footprint limit, unlimited,

35
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:05,449
that's fine. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go. Am I going to be in the YouTube rewind? No.

36
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:13,540
Why would I be in the YouTube rewind? Okay, company vids you welcome to this

37
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:20,300
dump or whatever, right? It's a, oh, wait, wait, wait. Your mission, should you choose to accept it?

38
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,980
Well, you have no choice but to accept it or face severe disciplinary measures, understood.

39
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,139
Now then, this sprawling facility and various accessible areas are to be rendered clean and

40
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,899
rehabitable. As always, once decontaminated and cleared, you are to ignore and forget any details

41
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,060
regarding the incident. The multitude of nations that may or may not be connected with the events

42
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,699
would just clean up. Finally, considering the nature of the operations and work,

43
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,300
it's advisable to proceed with caution. Certain devices and systems may remain operable.

44
00:07:47,980 --> 00:08:04,089
Well, that's a 10 million DPI. Okay, all right, so those of you who don't know how to play Vista

45
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:15,959
Cleanup Detail, it goes like this, and then you clean up stuff. I need to remember how to play.

46
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:24,519
All right, I need to track down a few things here. What's the, what room do I want to go to first?

47
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:33,350
Oh, right, put on music. This is new music, right? That's going to get my entire channel deleted.

48
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:51,450
No, that was, oh, that was all right. It's too loud, though. All right, so I need to find, where's the

49
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:58,860
broom? All right, this is a guy. Pick him up with the incinerator. Find the incinerator first. That's

50
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:10,490
most important. Okay, okay, okay. What's this? Warehousing. This shit don't work. What's this?

51
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,570
What's this? No, this is the particle exploder.

52
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:32,340
Oops. Uh, these are flares. It's a better broom. Now, that's where I put the USB drives.

53
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:58,679
Cool. So, where is the darks in here? Shit, this is so far away. Where's the incinerator?

54
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:10,360
Oh, god, this place is huge. All right, so this is where you get the buckets.

55
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:33,850
That's locked. Does this work? First floor. What about the sharks? Hold on. Oh, that's easy.

56
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:54,700
All right, wait, is this where you throw stuff away? Did they eat anything? Okay, did that,

57
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:22,659
okay, cool. Wait, I don't want to walk. What's in here? All right, let me, um, okay, I need a

58
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:32,409
buckets and shit. Buckets, buckets, buckets, buckets, and all right. Dude, Dr. Evil OST.

59
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:52,460
There is no, Dr. Evil OST. Is that even what you said? No, you said Dr. Phil OST. Right, okay.

60
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:11,529
That music sucks. I need my trash bag. Give me my trash bag. There it is.

61
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:31,509
Now, people get mad if I break this. Okay, we got some trash over here from the Home Depot OST.

62
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:54,970
I'm desperately trying to grab this. Isn't there a way to grab this a different way?

63
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:23,960
Depot theme. Hurry up. Home Depot theme. Now, I'll get you guys talking about the trash.

64
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:42,679
Very cool. All right, give me the mop. Do guns work? That'd be cool if they did. No. Okay,

65
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:53,429
just get rid of everything. Will they delete everything? So they can't be killed.

66
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:10,120
They're not gonna die, right? I need to clean that. I'll be up here, right?

67
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:28,539
One room at a time. This room first. I gotta bring, um, I need to fucking memorize where the

68
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:53,700
water comes out from. Give me this one. Go two at a time. Okay. When's he gonna do it?

69
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,940
When's he gonna do it? When's he gonna spill it? Here comes the first spill.

70
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:06,539
Fighting my tongue. I can't believe he's gonna do it. All right, corner to corner. Let's go.

71
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:25,340
What's over here that's dirty? This place is a clean. This is a clean. There it is. You got

72
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:38,200
what you wanted. You got what you wanted. There it is. You got it. Done. I did it.

73
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:57,740
Congratulations, everybody. Job well done, all of you. Okay, now next game. That's what I wanted.

74
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:14,360
All right, next. Next, do next thing. This one doesn't feel as messy as the other ones.

75
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,559
It just seems a little, it just seems bigger. Am I missing? Do I have to go down floors and shit?

76
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:30,539
Oh, that's gonna be hell. Let's put all the trash over here.

77
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:37,179
Fill joke has been filled. Time for the next game.

78
00:16:38,299 --> 00:17:01,960
Great. No, this is where we're staying and this is where we're ending. Play Dark Souls 3. I already

79
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:33,690
did. A lot. What qualifies as trash? Is that chair trash? Four game stream. I've never done that

80
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:42,599
before. What's the most games that you've seen on stream in one stream? Three? Two? Probably two or

81
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:54,460
three. Three, yeah. Go in the water. Why would I go in the water? That's death.

82
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:19,609
Isn't that gonna kill me? Yeah, no, this chair is junk. Look at this thing. Get rid of it. Why is

83
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:46,740
it still there? Good. Nice work. Nice work. Dr. Revo Lo St. Anything important? Trash. What's the

84
00:18:46,740 --> 00:19:02,279
dirtiest level in this whole game? Anybody know? What's like the bloodiest, dirtiest level? How did

85
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,559
I knock that over? I wasn't even near it. Like, honestly, next level spill joke. I wasn't even

86
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:27,539
there. It fell behind me. How do you flip things around quickly? R? E? T? How do you do it? There's

87
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:52,069
nothing in water in it. Trash. Okay, how are we looking? Not bad. I gotta make sure it's all done

88
00:19:52,869 --> 00:20:05,539
before moving on. No, I'm not doing face cam. There's no reason for face cam.

89
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:24,569
No, you know, I'm not doing it. No, I refuse. No, no, no. Eat that guy. Bring my trash receptacle

90
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:40,410
over here, please. One by one. I wish that... Can I just sweep these into the... Can I do that?

91
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:57,000
Can I do that? Yes, I can. That's it. I'm just painting. No, that's... Just do it. Just do it.

92
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:22,390
What do we got? This thing is filthy. Is it time to dump? Just very soon here it will be.

93
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:43,720
Time to dump, yeah. Yeah, it's time to dump. There's too much shit in here.

94
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:15,559
Good. Dumping. I know. I'm gonna mop it all up later. I should have done this first.

95
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:37,640
Face cam fortress. That's an old one. Are these open? I don't think they are.

96
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:59,029
Should you store your teeth? No, no, I don't like my teeth lately. Not lately.

97
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:12,710
That means they're clean, but they're not... They're not sparkling clean, and I don't like that.

98
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,450
I have to go back. I gotta get a cleaning or something. I think they're green. They're like

99
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:26,390
dark green. They're a clean green, but they're not... They're not like sparkling white, you know?

100
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:41,339
Yeah. How long has it been since what? How long since what been? All right,

101
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:43,339
now let's get the mop in here because everything's cleared out, right?

102
00:23:44,059 --> 00:24:01,019
Nothing else on the ground, right? I don't care about this. Dr. Moreau. Oh, okay. Somebody

103
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:07,589
screenshot that and read it later. These are both locked. Can I just pick up the whole thing?

104
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:16,089
Here, watch ready. That didn't work the way that I wanted it to, but what if we're throwing this

105
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:32,500
away anyway? Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Almost there. Looks all right. Bring a couple buckets.

106
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:53,880
Can I dunk my feet in there if I step in anything? I didn't fuck this up last time, so...

107
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:31,369
Baldi's Basics? I've never even played that game and I know what that is. How do I know that? Why do

108
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:49,829
I know that? I've never even seen anybody play that game. Why do I know that? It's only because of the

109
00:25:51,910 --> 00:26:06,460
in this song. That's what I'm thinking about that. All right, we're almost done. This fucking level

110
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:39,930
was easy. Fuck. No, it's the FOV. It's not balling up. Whatever. Easy. Yeah, there's this up there.

111
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:47,130
Why do I know this? I shouldn't know this. I've never fucking played this and I've never seen it.

112
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:55,849
I've seen the intro screen. What? I know this. Did I play this in my sleep?

113
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:19,670
And there's another character that goes like, hey, I... Did I? No, I didn't. I did not stream this game.

114
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:36,950
No, I did not. Give me a clip. I don't believe you. No fucking way. You did. No, I didn't. I know I

115
00:27:36,950 --> 00:28:06,700
did not. Okay, just bring them. Wake up. I don't want to wake up. I want to stay here. So, this is

116
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:20,259
just part one of like 10, right? In this level. Look at the clip. Nobody linked anything.

117
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:32,630
I'm getting... I'm getting gaslit by my own community. I know I didn't play it.

118
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:46,740
Why'd you leave the keys on the table? You made the video. What the fuck are you talking about?

119
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:54,900
Hold on. Wait, I need to save this because what if it breaks? Oh, shit. Look it. I have stuff.

120
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:14,839
Five and a half hours? What is this? I made this video. I'm going to play the whole song.

121
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:37,180
No, I'm not. I don't want to. I don't want to listen to that. I mean, it's a great song. It

122
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:50,900
just is. But I don't want to play the whole thing. And that just messed up my framerate. Sing the

123
00:29:50,900 --> 00:30:32,920
lyrics. I need water. Oh, I keep thinking. That stream was fucking ridiculous.

124
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:41,559
I wake up screaming sometimes because of that stream.

125
00:30:42,519 --> 00:31:20,549
No, no, it's not real. Oh, it was. That stream killed me. Me too. All right. Only a couple more

126
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:28,069
pieces of fresh. And that's it. And I beat it. It was pretty cool. It's pretty good level.

127
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:40,920
Nice and clean. I have some cigarettes. Looks good. Looks good. This one looks good.

128
00:31:40,920 --> 00:32:10,809
Good. Good. Good. It's a dirty monitor. Get in there. This is the longest YouTube video.

129
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:29,900
What do you mean? What are you talking about? YouTube video? Monitor lizard? I don't know

130
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:45,980
you guys talking about an S tier animal. S tier, yeah. Monitor lizard is an S tier animal. We

131
00:32:45,980 --> 00:33:00,490
already know that. I've already done the tier list. All right. Is this clean? It sure is.

132
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:49,720
All right. What's wrong? What's today's date? Uh, December 3rd. See, I do know some things.

133
00:33:52,299 --> 00:34:08,630
Cheating view the scanner. Part of the game. This looks pretty good. I would call this clean.

134
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:17,139
Would you? I didn't have to put a cheat code in to get this into the game. Wait, there's something

135
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:49,579
else here. Where is it? Bucket. Maybe it is the bucket. Is it? Is it? No, it's not the bucket.

136
00:34:49,579 --> 00:35:08,500
Look right here. Oh, well you can't clean them all. That room's done. Is it above?

137
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:19,579
I don't see anything above. All right. The bucket's out of here. It was the bucket. Yeah.

138
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:34,039
We're good. Room clean. Don't spill. Okay. Now let's just get rid of this.

139
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:41,139
How are we looking over here? This room is pretty normal. There's an elevator to go down.

140
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,570
There's an elevator to go down. There's an elevator to go down. That runs off the tongue.

141
00:35:46,570 --> 00:36:01,289
Really fun. Should I go down? Let me check these other floors. All right. Current floor.

142
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:15,510
One, two. Let's go take a look. Let's go to two. Am I on two?

143
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:43,610
Am I on two? Let's go down. Not there. This isn't even that messy though. That's not that messy.

144
00:36:50,949 --> 00:37:13,769
What is this? Is it? Is my? Is this massage chairs? Am I activating their massage chairs?

145
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:49,639
Okay, it's dropping. Oh yeah. All right. Cool. So just put all trash here.

146
00:37:49,719 --> 00:38:07,050
Jump in. Nope. I'm testing the theory. See where it goes. It goes. It's going into the

147
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:24,039
shark pit. I know where it's going. I can put them in there. I have one of those squares too.

148
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:33,929
Yeah, I don't even. Just get all trash ready. They have to be in the gray squares. Whatever.

149
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:48,570
It's okay. I'll do it in a minute. Just get it on a square. Coffee cup. Just get it on a square.

150
00:38:49,050 --> 00:39:11,610
Hats and shit. Just throw it away. Good. Wait, is this chair of music playing out of it?

151
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:26,920
That easy. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna push broom this stuff.

152
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:54,150
It's dirty. I know, but I'm gonna mop later. So it goes under the hole. That's not far enough.

153
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:16,920
Oh, it's a big brain, big brain place. Thank you. Big brain school. Nice.

154
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:35,539
Oh, these are going to have to be picked up individually. This is fine. Uh, drop this guy

155
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:45,130
down. See you. I want to watch though. All right. This is starting to look all right. Just need to

156
00:40:45,130 --> 00:41:10,940
mop eventually. I got a broom. Wait, hold on. This one does jump. Please. I am.

157
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,650
This one does jump. Please. I am.

158
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:47,989
Oh, hello. It's me Baldy. I am restoring Valia. I don't, I didn't play it. I don't fucking know why.

159
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:25,380
All these basics. I started with hand simulator and you guys told me I can't believe you're

160
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,539
playing the YouTuber game, but for some reason you'd like me to play all these basics.

161
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:51,860
I want you to say that into the mirror. I'm pretty cleansed.

162
00:42:54,019 --> 00:43:05,179
I like how the trash receptacles are just really right here. This is great.

163
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:14,710
We got it. All right. Now I need to get, uh, some water up here. Where's this music coming from?

164
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:58,139
Seriously. Use gun. You can't use gun. It's gonna be so much fun. It really is.

165
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:03,210
I would put this up there with like ocarina of time.

166
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:23,190
And you have to say ocarina of time. Otherwise your list is invalid. The best games ever made.

167
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:42,469
Am I ever going to play that monkey game again? No, no, I'm not.

168
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:50,440
No ancient. What's it called? Ancient ancestors. No, you will not see that game again.

169
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,619
I do. I do not think so.

170
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:06,940
I'm here. Uh, a lot of these random. I get that with a broom.

171
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:25,659
Drop them. I think I brought a bucket up here. Where the fuck does he live? It's four o'clock

172
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:32,820
in the morning. I live in the center of Pacific Ocean. I'm on it's currently on a submarine.

173
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:59,460
Where's the water? Water bucket. There it is. All right. We're going to work out,

174
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:08,760
bring the bucket in here. What are you dumb? We're on the sub cam.

175
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:20,139
You guys do realize that's the next step for IRL streaming, right? All right. Uh, we've,

176
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:28,619
we've been, I've been to every location on earth. Now I'm going to stream myself getting into a

177
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:43,429
space shuttle and going to the moon or Mars. I don't want to go to Mars. I'm going to stream

178
00:46:43,429 --> 00:47:04,070
the whole journey. It did that in the sixties already. Yeah, but, but it wasn't,

179
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:21,110
but it wasn't my favorite streamer. So whatever. I got to go more buckets. I am on floor one.

180
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,139
I know you're going to hate me for this, but I'm going to bring like three up there.

181
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,039
Somebody's getting the chat. I can already read their comment is going to say in all capitals,

182
00:47:42,920 --> 00:48:10,179
just fucking do it normally. God, I know I've already read it. I can see it already. See,

183
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:23,849
not a problem. Bounce there. I'll do it. Fuck it normally.

184
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:41,800
I keep, we're going to have to put our own OST on again. Oh, Paul, they space it.

185
00:48:45,300 --> 00:49:42,300
Where am I? That's the whole song. That's the, I thought it was more longer than this.

186
00:49:50,900 --> 00:50:01,659
Home Depot theme, the Home Depot theme song. You guys, this is real. Oh, it's this thing.

187
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:22,840
Let's save it. We're doing that's power. Home Depot. Now I know what you mean. This is all,

188
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:33,340
this song is too. It's like eight seconds. This song is six, not even one, two, three,

189
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:45,449
it's three seconds long. It's not even a song. It's just the end of the commercial after the

190
00:50:45,449 --> 00:51:10,860
guy says it. It's so stupid. It's growing on you. You can't be copyrighted if it's only three

191
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:29,289
seconds long. Oh, it's because I'm hearing this music too. I can't, I can't fucking do this anymore.

192
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:37,719
This is actually terrible. I mean, it's fine for a like 15 second ad for the Superbowl,

193
00:51:37,719 --> 00:52:12,809
but not right now. I have to stop this. Lowe's doesn't have one. That's unfortunate. How about

194
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:27,340
Allstate? How it's made. We've done that already. How about we need cleaning music. Music to clean

195
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:34,019
too. This doesn't have to be like a playlist. Catchy songs to clean your room. One hour of

196
00:52:34,019 --> 00:53:11,019
cleaning music. Okay. Oh, so some like dumb teenager made that. Some teenager made that

197
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:20,380
and that's fine. It's cool. Let's see what they have on their playlist. Cool. What's next?

198
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:28,780
Okay. What's the next one?

199
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:45,300
We should start now. Wait, is this Coldplay? Okay. What's the next one? I think this is,

200
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,039
uh, this one doesn't have a list. What's the next one?

201
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:12,340
I guess the search. That one didn't have a song. And not a bad playlist. Some of those. I don't

202
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:30,019
know what any of these are actually. Why would I type this? I, like I said before,

203
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:35,780
this stream was an extra stream for the week. And I can, you can tell that I just typed in,

204
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:52,599
um, I typed in piano key mashing. Like I was going to put that on. Nobody's made a video.

205
00:54:52,599 --> 00:55:03,019
I'm trying to find one. Okay. If you type in piano key mashing, nobody has like,

206
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:15,530
uh, why are you kidding me? How has nobody done this? This like 600 trillion videos on YouTube,

207
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:30,300
not one person made one. That's unbelievable to me. Hitting every key on piano. What is this?

208
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:46,329
Fast piano key hitting. I could do that faster. I know I can. This is the fastest in the world.

209
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:54,260
I can do faster than this. You guys know I can do that faster than this Guinness world record

210
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:06,250
fastest hitting the piano keys in a minute. I could beat this. No, I can't believe nobody

211
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:18,090
has a video where they just hit a bunch of keys and it's like a 15 minute long video. How you

212
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:42,940
guys got one? I found one. Did you actually find one? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

213
00:56:43,019 --> 00:57:11,449
Funny. All right. Who gives a shit? Wait, no, that's not it. That's not whatever. I'm done.

214
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:30,940
Just give me something normal to play. This took five seconds to find. What did you type in? No.

215
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:54,820
Yeah. Oh, the stinky video. I'm not, I don't trust you guys ever again. What is this? I can't put on

216
00:57:54,820 --> 00:58:24,840
like this music. This is the cartoon music. Okay. I'm done. I'm actually done. What I'm going for

217
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:35,099
this one. This would be best background music. That's all I need. This is just stress relief

218
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:57,429
music. Sounds good to me. I gotta like continue playing the video game guys. That's not even

219
00:58:57,429 --> 00:59:20,360
trash. Oh, you're a video game streamer now. Yes. I don't know what happened there. I know

220
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:37,619
it's a push from it still. Like what happened? Drop it. The best thing is I can drop these

221
00:59:37,619 --> 01:00:06,460
too, right? Yes, I can get rid of them. Just press every button for God sakes.

222
01:00:07,659 --> 01:00:35,780
Am I walking this around? Still have one bucket. That's clean. This is the same music that you

223
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:57,059
played when you died. Is it? It is. Dude, I scrawled a long way. I scrawled pretty fucking

224
01:00:57,059 --> 01:01:26,119
far. That's so stupid. This is the music I played when I died. Fuck me. God damn it.

225
01:01:26,760 --> 01:02:02,820
Okay, I can do a little bit more. I can do a little bit more cleanup. I have to use the device,

226
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:26,469
the shooter. This one's unlocked. Well, this is a mess. This is a mess. Just break a world record

227
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:35,579
on stream. Do you know how hard that is to do? People train for months doing the same thing

228
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:39,019
every day. And you want me to break a world record that I don't even know what record I'm

229
01:02:39,019 --> 01:02:54,489
going to break on stream. Just now. God, do it already.

230
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:59,940
5G noises. You want to play 5G noises? Fine. You guys are in trouble. You guys,

231
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:46,650
you guys are on restriction right now. Okay. This thing's actually called chilling and relaxing

232
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:55,590
to 60 cycle hump. 12 hours of power line, power line noise.

233
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:15,829
This is what I feel like. I feel like it feels like cell tower sounds. Do they actually make

234
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:36,230
sounds? No, I don't think they do. Let's keep going. Don't, don't, don't, don't let it go.

235
01:05:37,190 --> 01:06:01,349
Okay. Bring this one over here. Cool. No, I'm not playing it. I'm not playing it. You're making

236
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:07,900
that up in your head. There's no, I don't have any video on right now. You're making it up.

237
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:21,670
It's you. It's you. You think you hear it, but it's not there. That's just the air conditioner

238
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:46,840
in this room. Okay. Let me Dr. Phil. Dr. Phil. Sorry. Maybe some other day. Let's get this over

239
01:06:46,840 --> 01:07:19,670
here. Play background crowd noises. Like at a bar. How about, um, crowd noises? Yeah, that's fine.

240
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:44,869
Internet cafe. That's right. This is not the same one though. Do a Twitch con panel?

241
01:07:45,829 --> 01:08:13,849
You mean like right now? Yes. It's not Twitch con anymore. It hasn't been for a long time.

242
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:24,390
I need to dunk this in the water without knocking anything over.

243
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:35,619
Oh, fuck. Okay. Do a head start on next year's Twitch con panel. You're going to do

244
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:54,199
I'm not going to do a Twitch con panel. What the hell would I even tell you guys or anybody

245
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:13,109
dance? So if I, if I was on a Twitch con panel, what do you, what do Twitch con panels talk about?

246
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:34,119
I've never been to one. Weren't you there? I mean, I was at Twitch con. I never been to a

247
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:53,319
Twitch con panel. I had a Twitch con panel and I just had like a dummy on the stage and I was in

248
01:09:53,319 --> 01:10:10,140
a doctor's outfit and I was just doing open heart surgery to the dummy. And the, the name of the

249
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:18,390
panel would be, I made a mistake, but I have to do this anyways. You know, I made a scheduling

250
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:26,140
mistake, but, but this guy needs a new heart. You know what I mean? So that's what I'm doing.

251
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:44,569
I just have like 10 people all in scrubs, just like openly are these operating and then randomly

252
01:10:44,569 --> 01:10:52,340
answer Q and A questions about Twitch. That just, you know, like the people come up with a

253
01:10:52,340 --> 01:11:04,300
microphone. So how did you get your start? Uh, on Twitch? Well, uh, hold on just a second. Yep. I

254
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:12,170
need a, can we close that one please? See that up. Yep. Thank you. Well, I, uh, I funny thing,

255
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:27,020
I played team fortress too. And I made comedy video. You have to do that now. I, do you don't,

256
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,819
do you think that they're going, I would ever be allowed to do something like that?

257
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:41,750
That's the type of scenario where you tell somebody that idea and then they go, oh, yeah. Whoa. Super,

258
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:48,869
super cool. Interesting idea. Let me, uh, let me throw some lines out and yeah, cool though.

259
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:55,909
Cool idea. And then they, you don't, they never talk to you again. That's how that works.

260
01:11:56,630 --> 01:12:16,680
Those aren't Twitch panels reserved for, but do you have to actually talk about something?

261
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:23,270
I feel like they wouldn't want me just to make a mockery of Twitch panels, right? I don't think

262
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:41,770
they would want, I don't think they would want me to do that. Oh, just, just copy, just copy pen

263
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:47,369
and teller. And I have a panel where it's, what's the name of their show? Like fool us.

264
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:53,670
And I get up there and I'm like, welcome to a magician. I just bring like magicians on to like

265
01:12:53,670 --> 01:13:17,609
fool me. I have to try to figure out what they did. Yeah. They filmed that show in Vegas and bring

266
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:25,449
in a, just bring in a bunch of really expensive looking fake cameras and hire 10 people to be

267
01:13:25,529 --> 01:13:29,529
fake production staff. Like this is a real show that's on television, but all the cameras aren't

268
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:39,960
even real. Like it's, it's nothing about it is real at all. People are going to come into the,

269
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,359
into the panel, into the hall and they're going to look around and be like, holy shit,

270
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:47,239
there's like fucking 10 cameras. There's like a guy on a crane that he's sitting like Steven

271
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:51,979
Spielberg style sitting in the crane camera seat. The camera is made out of plastic. It's not real.

272
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:10,619
Crane is also plastic. Well, I think that would be kind of dangerous. So that would not be the case.

273
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:22,680
And have 250 actors be the audience and have one person actually in there that signed up for the

274
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:38,180
panel. And people are like treating it like it's a real thing. You know, actually would be kind of

275
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:47,130
funny is to have a panel, but to actually do that. I have a bunch of people that are hired to be

276
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:53,050
there to just talk you up and say how awesome you are and ask a bunch of questions and then

277
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:57,850
never really talk about it. But like somehow it comes out that those were all fake paid people

278
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:13,689
to be there. I would just look so bad and so fucked up. I would, it would just look really awful.

279
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:32,409
That's impractical jokers type shit. Yeah. Do a Reddit AMA. I do a Reddit AMA, but it's not even

280
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:40,220
me doing the AMA. It's not even me. And like halfway or like 75% of the way through that AMA,

281
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:49,670
my channel goes live and I'm sleeping in my bed. And then the stream turns off after like

282
01:15:49,670 --> 01:16:09,579
two to three minutes. Nope, that ain't me talking. Two to three hours? Oh, I don't think I could do

283
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:20,279
that. Or have an AMA, but have like 10 accounts pretending to be me. One of them is the real one

284
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:26,300
and we're all answering questions. One of those accounts is real, but you don't know which one.

285
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:44,220
Everything looks good, except for this window that needs to be broken. Never mind.

286
01:16:45,180 --> 01:17:03,060
That's the EQ stream, but in reverse. I would call this room clean except for this one.

287
01:17:03,939 --> 01:17:16,569
There might be a couple of, uh, oh wait. Nope. Nevermind. I gotta get rid of all these bullet

288
01:17:16,569 --> 01:17:43,609
holes. Here comes spade tornado. Oh, progress is being, uh, progress is being made on the

289
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:48,649
Minecraft stream by the way. That still should be, should be good to go for the 15th.

290
01:17:48,649 --> 01:17:56,649
I mean, depending on how long it takes the, uh, the devs to put it all together,

291
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:03,500
I will have a better answer soon, but looking like it's going to happen. It will, this will

292
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:12,600
probably happen at least in December, but we're still shooting for the 15th. So that should be

293
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:20,069
fun. No, no, no, no. Not like the actual devs of Minecraft, like the people that are making

294
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:25,029
the server for all this to go down and all the plugins and everything.

295
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:48,680
Get them all in one go, get them all in one go, get them all in one go. Come on, do it.

296
01:18:53,699 --> 01:19:20,229
I left one behind. Leaving one behind is fine. Leaving 12 behind is not. Hey, that's me. Who?

297
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:40,979
Me. All right, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it. This is going to be the worst room in real

298
01:19:40,979 --> 01:19:56,439
life. Yeah, it's made out of strands of hair. All right, that's good enough for now. Make a joke.

299
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:18,729
What are you talking about? Make a joke. I'm not a woody doll. You pull the back, you pull my string

300
01:20:18,729 --> 01:20:40,979
and I just say something. There's buttons under here. I want to press them. How do I press these

301
01:20:40,979 --> 01:21:05,300
buttons? How do you crouch? What does that do? What the hell does that do? Shit, 5G dude, 5G.

302
01:21:14,920 --> 01:22:09,029
Are you ready for 5G? Which one is this? This one? Okay, it's that one. Press it, press this button.

303
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:32,680
I can't press this now? This only works one time. Are you kidding me? Crouch, control, C, space,

304
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:50,300
caps lock, shift. What is crouch? Control, C, V, F, C, control. There is no crouch.

305
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,340
In the evening, in the event of my escape, I will bring Puddlesworth with me. I expect all of you

306
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:35,260
to attend to his requirements. You left your ring. That's a big ass ring. Caution. Caution. Submarine.

307
01:23:35,260 --> 01:24:04,810
See, I told you I live here. Did you get out? It's clean. Re-chat, re-chat, re-chat. It's a collar.

308
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:19,930
Yeah, I know. Look, here's the cat right there. There. See?

309
01:24:53,979 --> 01:25:00,649
Get on there. Fucking thing's not fucking working. Fucking stupid, fucking dumb,

310
01:25:00,649 --> 01:25:15,510
fucking dumb, fucking stupid, fucking thing. This room is clean. Take a look. It's like nothing

311
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:28,279
ever happened in here except for these two blood stains. Pick them up. Fine. The bullet holes.

312
01:25:28,920 --> 01:26:01,699
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d. I know. Remember dead bodies up here? New viewer here. This guy's pretty cool.

313
01:26:02,899 --> 01:26:14,630
Hey, thanks. Welcome. Welcome to the channel. How come there's no Twitch preview for when

314
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:19,829
somebody's new? Instead of a pre-roll ad, if you've never clicked on this channel before,

315
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:24,390
instead of a 30-second pre-roll ad, why don't you get like a, hey, my name's German on A5.

316
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:28,550
Welcome to the channel. And like a cut-up of a highlight and stuff.

317
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:45,399
Crazy things happen here all the time. 5G! The 5G, it hurts!

318
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:52,199
But I also do real talks. And then it cuts to another one. And I'm talking about like real shit.

319
01:26:53,399 --> 01:27:16,619
I also, I also have a hernia. Why would I put that in my trailer?

320
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:24,340
Just in case you didn't know, I have a hernia. Okay. All right. What, why do I have to know that?

321
01:27:24,899 --> 01:27:51,750
Oh, my rib cage is all fucked up. Just let it vent, chat. That is the lore.

322
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:03,380
I can't wait to, I don't even care if you guys don't want to see it. I'm going to make it in

323
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:23,319
front of the green screen channel trailer. And who remembers this one? Hi, German985 here. You

324
01:28:23,319 --> 01:28:30,020
might know me as the Shpee Guy. Cut to like, Shpee, Shpee, like you've seen me say it like five times.

325
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:43,899
But I'm so much more than that. Just last week, I broke the world record. I'm the current world

326
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:52,810
record holder for clicking a single mouse button more times than anyone in five seconds. And then

327
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:57,210
I whip my hand up over my mouth to kind of lean in, whisper and be like, try to beat that one.

328
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:17,050
I'm also the only person that's slapped themselves in the face very hard, not on purpose.

329
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:30,949
In fact, it's probably, I'm probably more known for that than the carnival I did. And I'm going

330
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:56,970
to look right into the camera and be real fucking sad. All right. It's clean. We're good. And then

331
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:05,260
it's going to, the best part about if you could actually have that is I have to fucking,

332
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:16,039
don't make me do this. It's just make people think they're getting an ad on the stream.

333
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:21,529
Is that against term service? It's just in the middle of my stream, just fucking boom, play,

334
01:30:21,529 --> 01:30:25,770
just like have a pretend like ad banner on it and like have a play over the video.

335
01:30:26,729 --> 01:30:38,199
So it's like, you're actually getting an ad on my stream, but it's just, it's pumped in.

336
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:57,140
Imagine having an ad play on your stream. It's your own stream. And it's talking about,

337
01:30:58,390 --> 01:31:01,750
Hey, you should like stick around. And it's like, it's like six minutes.

338
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,779
And then it cuts back and I don't fucking say anything. I'm just, I,

339
01:31:05,779 --> 01:31:09,779
I, as if I continued playing where I left off, where I, you know, six minutes in the game has

340
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:18,180
gone by. Oh, you guys got an ad. All right. Hold onto that one. You might see it. All right. I'm

341
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:36,180
done up here. Everything's clean. You have this rocket ship. That's just a YouTube. Yeah. I know.

342
01:31:38,250 --> 01:32:06,649
Press the button. This button. Press the button. All right. Next, next room. Wait,

343
01:32:06,649 --> 01:32:09,529
Twitch staff is in here. What, who, who, who on Twitch staff is in here?

344
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:23,640
I should just make a bunch of fucking fake commercial shit. What was that?

345
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:30,810
Hey, commercials for like grills and shit that I, that I apparently am endorsing that I,

346
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:40,710
that aren't real staff is here because you said you were taking a dump on your desk.

347
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,180
Fuck. Oh,

348
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:10,949
like too much headquarters. You get, you get, you get a, a lead. It says, Hey, uh,

349
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:15,510
just made somebody stick around there for a while. This guy said he was going to take a dump on his

350
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:35,159
desk. You just sit in there with the stream open, just with your hand, I'll be mild, just like,

351
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:43,369
okay, what the fuck is this guy doing? Your hand is hovering over the like turn off stream.

352
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:51,529
Okay. What else do I have to do? Let's go. I gotta go up a floor.

353
01:33:55,479 --> 01:34:15,939
Your ribs are breaking. Streamer, streamer removed from Twitch for threatening to take dump on desk.

354
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:20,890
Oh, that's fucking so stupid.

355
01:34:25,529 --> 01:34:32,250
Career over. Please jump in the shark pit. All right, I'll do it for you. I'm going to do it for you.

356
01:34:32,890 --> 01:35:00,939
My friend. It's me. I'm back. Ooh, good. I gotta go up a floor.

357
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:14,220
I'm going to get calls to the principal's office. Like a DM on like Twitter or something.

358
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:20,340
Did you Twitch staff Andrew or something? Hey, you got time to chat.

359
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:48,359
Uh, what's up? Hey, so, uh, we're going down. We're going to go three.

360
01:35:54,939 --> 01:36:13,460
All right. This is not bad. Door control. Enter code. Now here's the really fun thing.

361
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:21,300
Not even fun. All right. So, oh, didn't DM from which staff? Oh, no, no. Oh, boy.

362
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:28,250
Hey, what's up? I'm sorry. I'm sorry about talking about shitting on my desk. I'll never happen again.

363
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:34,500
I promise that was really fucked up. Hey, dude, just want to say congratulations on your for your

364
01:36:34,500 --> 01:37:00,949
partner. Right. Right. Okay. Thanks. But now that you said, what are you talking about?

365
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:08,819
Nothing. I didn't. Don't worry. I just, I'm, you know, Mr. Comedy Man. That's what I do.

366
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:14,659
Hold on. Somebody's linked me a clip. Oh, don't click that. It's probably a virus.

367
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:23,899
You know, it's not important. Just get them on the elevator. Who cares?

368
01:37:24,859 --> 01:37:35,189
Who cares how they're on the elevator? Just get them in. Get another message back. Yeah,

369
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:45,350
I've reviewed this clip. I don't know what to say about this. Bring it all.

370
01:37:46,310 --> 01:38:07,180
All of it. All of it. All of it. It's in here.

371
01:38:23,449 --> 01:38:35,560
Uh, okay. Do I open these? Say it. Say what? What would you say if you were really,

372
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:40,600
really sort of tense and scared and there's a fucked up moment that's about maybe about to happen?

373
01:38:40,600 --> 01:39:06,739
What would you say?

374
01:39:15,029 --> 01:39:30,310
I'm just picking stuff up and moving it. Launch aborted. One second remaining. All right. I

375
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:35,510
can't do this yet. I need the code. What's the code? Just give it to me. I just want to tell

376
01:39:35,510 --> 01:40:06,260
me what it is. I'll sit here all day. I don't care how long this takes. I'm waiting for someone to

377
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:51,300
put the real one in. Why would I ever think that would be real? I mean, it's been in the chat so

378
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,739
many times that how am I supposed to know that that's not how am I supposed to know that?

379
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:25,380
They are random. What makes a different sound? It was on the cat's collar. Thank you. Appreciate it.

380
01:41:27,369 --> 01:41:52,460
Thank you. Where's the elevator? How do I get out of here? Am I stuck in here?

381
01:41:59,449 --> 01:42:07,850
No, there it is. Right. I fucking barricaded myself. Where is it? Two

382
01:42:08,569 --> 01:42:37,579
cats collar. This is not even right. Screen blinks green when you do a right number.

383
01:42:38,539 --> 01:42:56,779
Oh, I'm already here. Let me see. Is it on the cat's collar? Mr. Cuddlesworth.

384
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:27,270
Right. Is it on the back? Oh, how is this not spilled? These two have not spilled.

385
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:33,909
That's almost impossible. I sneeze next to one of these and they break and they fall over.

386
01:43:33,909 --> 01:44:01,529
It does a green. It blinks green. Wait. All right. Hold on. The second number is three.

387
01:44:04,039 --> 01:44:22,470
Second number and fifth number are three. Third number is seven. Fourth number is seven.

388
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:37,529
Something. Wait, what? First number is eight. First number is eight. Three. No.

389
01:44:37,529 --> 01:44:57,270
Eight. Three. Eight. Three. Seven. Eight. Three. Seven. Three. Nope. Eight. Three. Eight. Seven.

390
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:10,939
Three. Three. Eight. Seven. No, it's eight. Three. Seven. Seven. Eight. Three. Seven. Seven. Eight.

391
01:45:10,939 --> 01:45:27,930
No. Eight. Three. Eight. Three. Seven. Seven. Three. Now what? Seven. What's on lock? What did I do?

392
01:45:29,289 --> 01:46:02,100
Oh, shit. Can I launch this? Death Ray is ready. Fire the weapon in Yellowstone.

393
01:46:02,659 --> 01:46:11,399
Okay. Where's the button to go? Fire the missile. How do you fire the missile?

394
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:33,399
Do I have to throw a match in here? Launch the missile. What do you think I'm trying to look for? A way to launch it.

395
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:47,590
Man. All the way from the ground floor. Okay. Well, I want to launch this shit. Let's go.

396
01:46:48,869 --> 01:47:18,140
All right. It's locked. Where the hell am I? What is all I'm going to do? This map is huge.

397
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,770
There it is. All right. Here's the way to... How do I get this open?

398
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:47,189
German. I dot dot dot. What? Oh, no. All right. Two. Two is the first number.

399
01:47:48,310 --> 01:48:02,060
This is... Holy shit. Do you see how long this code is? I have to write this down. Oh, my fucking

400
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:16,779
God. I gotta write it down. Two is the first number. Two. Four. No. There's four in here.

401
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:35,000
There's a backspace. Yeah. Two. One. Two. Four. Two. Three. Two. Five. Two. Six. Two. Seven. Eight. Two.

402
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:54,260
One. You know. Two. Three. Two. Eight. Three. Four. Five. Eight. Six. Seven. Nine. Zero. One. Two.

403
01:48:54,260 --> 01:49:51,270
What? Three. Okay. Three. One. Okay. Almost. Okay. One more. Pay attention. I wasn't paying

404
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:53,989
attention. I wasn't paying attention. It's not what I want. I wasn't paying attention. What was

405
01:49:53,989 --> 01:50:14,659
that number? Two. What? Two. Eight. Two. Eight. Three. Three. Five. Three. Guys, I don't... Two.

406
01:50:14,659 --> 01:50:28,199
Eight. Three. Three. Five. Three. Seven. Nine. What's the last number? Six. Seven. Eight.

407
01:50:29,239 --> 01:50:48,550
What's that? What's the last number? What's the last number? Four. Am I gonna miss the explosion?

408
01:50:50,840 --> 01:51:16,020
Wait. Map. It's so big. This is a huge map. This is so big. I'm not gonna be... I'm not doing this

409
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:28,600
whole thing on stream. No. Nope. It's not gonna happen. You're not meant to do it in one day.

410
01:51:29,479 --> 01:52:06,409
Yeah, I know. Frogman? Whoa. I'm interested. What's this? I would get so lost in here.

411
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:37,420
I already am. Giant laser? Holy shit. Okay. So there's two target acquired.

412
01:52:39,689 --> 01:53:43,050
That's cool. Recharging. Wait. Can I move it around? I lived on the moon. I'm sorry.

413
01:53:44,409 --> 01:54:14,149
I think I did it. You have 24 hours until it hits the earth. I'm supposed to be cleaning.

414
01:54:16,119 --> 01:54:30,970
This is too expansive. It's too expansive. I want to launch this, though. How do I open this thing?

415
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:57,609
That's the wrong one. So it's this one. How do I get you open? There's gotta be a way to get this

416
01:54:57,609 --> 01:55:20,920
open, right? This way? Baldi's waiting room. You're never going to see Baldi's basics on this stream.

417
01:55:22,199 --> 01:55:36,149
I need to explain to you why. Can I just like... Wait a minute. What are the tools? A beacon.

418
01:55:36,949 --> 01:55:54,250
Well, I don't think we can launch the thing because I don't know how to open the door.

419
01:55:55,210 --> 01:56:08,380
You either play Doki Doki Literature Club or you play Baldi. There are no alternatives.

420
01:56:08,779 --> 01:56:21,829
No. All right. Let's just pretend this is the room that I cleaned and this is the one that

421
01:56:22,789 --> 01:56:37,720
is the one that matters right now. Look at how clean it is, right? I don't have the broom anymore.

422
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:44,329
All right. I have to take care of this. This is a lot of bullshit. I need to go back down to...

423
01:56:56,340 --> 01:57:06,220
What was still needs to be cleaned up here? There's a whole spot over here. What is going

424
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:36,199
on? Yeah. This spot here. God damn it. I need buckets. Okay. Bucket and bring three.

425
01:57:37,239 --> 01:57:48,140
I need to ascend. To where? I don't need to ascend. Jump in and out of the pool real quick.

426
01:57:49,100 --> 01:58:21,960
I already did that. You missed it. I'm bored. Dual voice. Just give me a minute. I'm down.

427
01:58:22,119 --> 01:58:36,569
Stream's over. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. So tomorrow,

428
01:58:37,130 --> 01:58:45,100
tomorrow, what is planned is Joel and I are going to be potentially... We're going to be starting

429
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:55,539
Halo Reach. We're going to do Halo Reach today, but we rescheduled for tomorrow.

430
01:58:56,100 --> 01:59:01,930
And then I played Hand Simulator and everybody... If you weren't here earlier,

431
01:59:01,930 --> 01:59:08,090
rewind to that part of the VOD. Everybody thought it was so fucking funny. So good.

432
01:59:09,050 --> 01:59:15,779
They're not watering these. This is a razor.

433
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:32,359
Joel's going to ignore you and just play Baldi's Basics. Don't even kid.

434
01:59:40,949 --> 01:59:47,989
But yeah, so I decided instead of just postponing streaming till tomorrow, we're going to... We

435
01:59:47,989 --> 01:59:54,489
decided to play a triple game today. Stream is just an extra one. I'm going to go three

436
01:59:54,489 --> 02:00:01,210
days in a row from here on out after this. I'm assuming Halo Reach will be maybe a full stream

437
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:06,869
or two. I don't know what the plans are. We'll see. And then we're going to play Tools Up.

438
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:11,430
We're going to see if we can get that to work with the second, third, fourth day.

439
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:15,899
Play Hand Simulator tomorrow. I already got what I wanted out of it.

440
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:24,020
But no more Hand Simulator. I already said it was the worst game of the decade.

441
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:31,140
And I kind of regret saying that because that's definitely not true. I know it's not true.

442
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:35,380
But I said it and I need to retract that statement because that's definitely not true.

443
02:00:45,579 --> 02:00:57,239
Of the decade. All right. Yeah, I'll call... No, not yet. I want to clean this house.

444
02:01:10,149 --> 02:01:19,739
Just... I want to do this part. I'm almost done. Well, okay. It's a base, not a house.

445
02:01:20,619 --> 02:01:32,970
Why does this shit not work? Five more minutes, mom. Five more minutes. Five more minutes.

446
02:01:33,850 --> 02:01:47,449
Oh, let's just bring them up there. Baldi, Baldi, Baldi. One day I will just turn on Baldi's Basics

447
02:01:47,449 --> 02:01:55,399
and I'm not going to tell you when. It'll just happen one day. You'll just see it one day.

448
02:01:56,119 --> 02:02:10,500
That's a lie. That's a lie. That's a lie. Can't be a lie if it hasn't happened yet.

449
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:18,460
All right. So if I told you that I was going to play Baldi's Basics and then

450
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:31,609
six years went by and I played it, is that a lie? No, I played it. I didn't say I was going to play

451
02:02:31,609 --> 02:02:51,689
it tomorrow. Can I clean this in here? You actually can. Wow. Technically. Yeah. Halo

452
02:02:51,689 --> 02:02:55,369
Reach should be fun. By the way, for those of you that don't know, I have never played

453
02:02:56,699 --> 02:03:03,579
one solitary minute of Halo. I told you Halo 2 is the only one I've ever played

454
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:09,420
and I played the multiplayer across like four TVs once or twice in college.

455
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:21,340
I've never played one second of any of the campaigns. So we'll find out. That's not a lie.

456
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:30,260
That is not a lie. I've never played Halo. I mean, so I've lied. No, I never had an Xbox.

457
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:38,840
I didn't have a regular Xbox and I got an Xbox 360 late into the game and just didn't play them.

458
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:48,739
We played Halo 2. It's a multiplayer. Maybe for 45 seconds in two or three lives when I drove a

459
02:03:48,739 --> 02:04:03,430
car into a wall and like threw a grenade at somebody. But okay, what constitutes playing

460
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:11,270
the game? Okay is. Oh, I played Halo 2, but I really didn't though. I can't even name you one

461
02:04:11,270 --> 02:04:20,470
gun. I guess I physically pressed the button on it once and then I've watched somebody play for

462
02:04:20,470 --> 02:04:34,069
15 minutes. So you played it. Yes. Physically I have sat in front of the screen and played

463
02:04:34,069 --> 02:04:50,739
Halo 2 multiplayer for a minute or two minutes tops. So you played it. I guess I've played it.

464
02:05:01,029 --> 02:05:17,850
Literally competitive Halo. I love how somebody's doing that joke for me right now and I didn't even

465
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:47,109
plan it. All right. All right. I'll see you guys later. I'm gonna call it here. This was a real

466
02:05:47,109 --> 02:05:53,739
wild one. And Medieval is actually pretty fun. So you may actually see me complete that game.

467
02:05:53,739 --> 02:06:00,460
You actually might because it was pretty fun. I did enjoy it. Thanks for watching the secret.

468
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:03,260
I don't even have a secret. I tweeted about it and I told everybody I streamed today.

469
02:06:03,659 --> 02:06:06,460
Uh, thanks for the coming to the extra stream this week.

470
02:06:07,590 --> 02:06:19,350
See you tomorrow for Halo Reach Cooperative Multiplayer Campaign with Joel. Thanks for

471
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:29,539
watching guys. You made a video on Halo. I'm not going to click another Rick roll. Jump in.

472
02:06:32,569 --> 02:07:10,310
My computer crashed. I just have a bloody screen. Yeah, there's just blood on the screen.

473
02:07:18,010 --> 02:07:25,000
All right. Actually, good night guys. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm looking forward to Halo. I've

474
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:31,420
heard a lot of things about Halo. I've heard, dude, Halo is, is just, it's like the best. You

475
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:44,439
have to play it. You're going to love it. I hope so. And when they all release, I'm going to be

476
02:07:44,439 --> 02:07:48,680
playing all of them. I mean, I can't necessarily guarantee I'm going to co-op every single one of

477
02:07:48,680 --> 02:08:03,859
them, but we'll see. Hey, Bob Boy. What's going on, Bob Boy? Thanks for the five subs. Richard

478
02:08:03,859 --> 02:08:11,930
Nixon's still a top sub gifter. Thank you. But let's go back. Let's do the bits. I'll see you

479
02:08:11,930 --> 02:08:18,979
guys tomorrow. Thanks for hanging out earlier, earlier, about six, what six hours ago. Yes.

480
02:08:20,779 --> 02:08:30,310
Hey, uh, hey, turret hugger. Thanks for the 500 bits. That face when hernia. Poor Jeremy show

481
02:08:30,310 --> 02:08:42,979
love. Appreciate it. Thank you. I'll be okay though. I'll be good to go. We'll continue to

482
02:08:42,979 --> 02:08:52,520
work on it and see what happens. Appreciate it. Oh, so thank you to swiggity swanky for 250

483
02:08:52,520 --> 02:09:01,380
bits. They say hand simulator. What is this? Let's find out. You ma'am, get your hands in there.

484
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:08,470
Like open this up and get your hands in there and just start feeling around. I want you, you. Oh,

485
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:14,890
wait, this is me talking about how I want, I told ma'am, get your hands. Yeah. Look at how old this

486
02:09:14,970 --> 02:09:19,449
is. Get your hands in there and just start feeling around. I want you. All right. This is two years

487
02:09:19,449 --> 02:09:24,489
ago. This is me describing what I wanted the doctor to do. I wanted to do exploratory surgery on me.

488
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:42,420
Yeah, that was, that was two years ago. Jesus. Time flies when you have a hernia. Thank you,

489
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:47,140
Zeke for the 250. Your streams have been a soundtrack to many long lonely nights of studying.

490
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:53,609
Cheers for that. Still waiting for the cooking stream. Hopefully it's worth the wait when you

491
02:09:53,609 --> 02:10:00,489
see it eventually. We'll see. Hey, Jason, thanks for the 500 bits. Hey, German, today marks the

492
02:10:00,489 --> 02:10:05,449
one year since I first started watching you. Today's also the same day since the green screen

493
02:10:05,449 --> 02:10:09,609
movie night. Ever since then, I was hooked on your content and never missed a stream. Not only have

494
02:10:09,609 --> 02:10:14,409
you helped me through so many tough times, but most importantly, you've helped us. Whether it's

495
02:10:14,409 --> 02:10:20,090
being called short or saying, look at me, you never cease to make us laugh. I'm so grateful to

496
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:29,420
have discovered such a great guy. Keep on keeping on. Thank you. I really appreciate it, Jason.

497
02:10:32,979 --> 02:10:44,579
I'm glad you stuck around. Hope you continue to do so. Thanks again. Hey, Marvish McGally,

498
02:10:44,579 --> 02:10:48,100
thanks for the 250. I look forward to the stream with Joel, especially after we recently reacted

499
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:56,489
to rat movies on stream. Not sure if you saw that. It was quite wholesome. Yeah, we'll see. The one

500
02:10:56,489 --> 02:11:04,100
thing I'm concerned about is ping tomorrow. We're going to have to see how the connection is from,

501
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:15,640
you know, across the world. Might be interesting. But yeah, that's, Joel's a funny guy.

502
02:11:16,279 --> 02:11:26,739
Let's see how the stream is tomorrow. It's not, it won't be too bad. Let's hope so.

503
02:11:26,739 --> 02:11:37,380
Because remember, I'm Pacific. So West Coast to, I wonder how far the travel time is. But thank you,

504
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:42,869
Marvish McGally. Appreciate it. Thank you, Gnarly, for the 250. My friend got me to play Hand

505
02:11:42,869 --> 02:11:47,510
Simulator. I've never raged more at a game in my entire life. I've beaten every Soulsborne and I

506
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:53,350
actively play League of Legends and yet fucking Hand Meme Game is what breaks me. Fuck this game.

507
02:11:53,350 --> 02:12:05,739
Fun stream. You know the thing about that game? I would have sat there until I got it. Until I got

508
02:12:05,739 --> 02:12:15,909
it, I would have done it. But I had, I had to stop. I had to just pull the plug. Even if I wasn't

509
02:12:15,909 --> 02:12:19,909
streaming, I would have sat there for like six hours trying to put the clip into the handgun.

510
02:12:19,909 --> 02:12:30,970
I know I would have. You didn't though, you said it. I put it, I put the clip into the gun and I

511
02:12:30,970 --> 02:12:36,869
fired the gun. I didn't, there's, I didn't shoot at anything. I didn't hit any targets.

512
02:12:37,829 --> 02:12:52,819
That's okay. Thank you, Final Fantasy, for the 300 bits. They say nice. Thank you. Martin had

513
02:12:52,819 --> 02:12:57,460
a meme. Thanks for the thousand bits. 10 bucks. Appreciate that. Jerma, you should have, you should

514
02:12:57,460 --> 02:13:02,340
have just admitted to the gun range owner that this was your first time. Lying about your experience

515
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:08,979
is never right. Now you're gonna have to make up excuses like, I swear this doesn't usually happen.

516
02:13:08,979 --> 02:13:18,500
I guess I'm just nervous. Thank you, Snarobosis, for the 10 community subs earlier. Don't think

517
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:24,739
we saw it. I think I was in the middle of doing a chill stream where I get very angry at a game

518
02:13:24,739 --> 02:13:29,060
that I then call the worst game of the decade. Chilling out, just hanging out. Chill stream today.

519
02:13:29,939 --> 02:13:35,449
Extra chill stream. Thank you though for the 10 community subs. Appreciate it.

520
02:13:35,449 --> 02:13:45,539
And thank you, Martin had a meme again for the thousand bits. CAD, BTV. What's going on CAD?

521
02:13:46,869 --> 02:13:53,350
A thousand bits here from CAD. What a game. It gives you a gun, makes you want to shoot yourself,

522
02:13:53,350 --> 02:14:11,380
and then doesn't let you. All right, no. Hey, Jerma95 AMA. How's it going? I could get a large

523
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:16,659
number 10 with fries, please. No. Did you ever play Halo? When's the next Kenshi stream?

524
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:23,319
Kenshi was an incredible experience and I'd love to stream it again. However, when you do multiple

525
02:14:23,319 --> 02:14:27,319
streams in a row like that, it can get pretty tiring. A lot of people in chat were tired of it

526
02:14:27,319 --> 02:14:30,920
too, but seeing how warm of a response the videos on the second channel got, I'll probably play it

527
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:35,640
again at some point. It's supposed to be fun to return to it at some point. Just like I return

528
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:44,310
every Tuesday to get a $5 waffle meal at Burger King. What was that sketch you had 100% confidence

529
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:50,260
in that didn't execute as expected? The infamous slap myself in the face joke was supposed to end

530
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:55,300
with me turning around and leaving the room, with my arm whipping around, with my body turning to

531
02:14:55,300 --> 02:15:00,020
follow, but I timed it wrong while looking at my second monitor. I suppose that went better than

532
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:04,979
expected, much like the $12 or 99 family bundle deal they have at Burger King. That's three

533
02:15:04,979 --> 02:15:08,020
cheeseburgers, three small fries, and three waffles for under $13.

534
02:15:11,579 --> 02:15:16,340
Thoughts on the new Crispy Pretzel Chicken Fries? Did Burger King Crispy Crunchy Pretzel outside

535
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:20,899
tender juicy white meat chicken inside new Crispy Pretzel Chicken Fries?

536
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:28,899
That stream was a mess. I don't condone the things I said while I was live. It was really

537
02:15:28,899 --> 02:15:33,460
out of character. I don't think you'll be seeing me streaming with him again. Sorry. What?

538
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:41,449
Have you ever tried coffee marinated chicken stuffed with Cheetos before?

539
02:15:42,489 --> 02:15:47,050
Oh, look at you. It's the same fucking coffee Cheetos chicken joke again. Well played. Look,

540
02:15:47,050 --> 02:15:53,050
everyone. We have a fucking comedy genius over here. Jesus Christ, you subhuman. Okay.

541
02:15:53,050 --> 02:16:01,800
Can't think of anything. This is not me. This is not me. This is me. This is somebody. This is me

542
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:07,850
pretending that this is somebody pretending to be me. Why are you a massive compulsive liar?

543
02:16:08,649 --> 02:16:12,329
If you're looking to throw hands, I'd be willing to meet you at next year's

544
02:16:13,369 --> 02:16:20,890
winner buys the other a $3 10 piece nugget. Okay. I can't. Okay. Oh my fucking God damn it.

545
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:46,299
All right. That's it. That's it. That's it. All right. Abort, abort, abort, abort, abort, abort.

546
02:16:46,299 --> 02:16:55,110
I'm not, there's no AMAs going on. There's no AMAs going on. There's no AMAs.

547
02:17:07,639 --> 02:17:40,489
It's your AMA. It's not my AMA. Why? This guy, this is a PR nightmare for me. Yes. This is going to

548
02:17:40,489 --> 02:17:47,049
pop up like 10 times. I have no control over this. No, no. What? What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Wait,

549
02:17:47,049 --> 02:17:53,290
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. A real AMA. You have to prove it's a real AMA. Don't,

550
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:56,489
I have to tweet out a picture of me holding up a sign that's pointing to it going like,

551
02:17:56,489 --> 02:18:04,579
Reddit AMA. Uh, January 10th, 2020. Right? That's how you know it's real. So it doesn't matter.

552
02:18:15,909 --> 02:18:25,530
Fucking damn it. Okay. Let's keep going. Let's keep going. PR nightmare.

553
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:46,200
Anyways, thank you. Really appreciate it. Large 27. Thanks for the 500 bits.

554
02:18:47,159 --> 02:18:51,209
Dermot, please for the love of all that is holy, stop for your health and mine. I can't take it

555
02:18:51,209 --> 02:18:56,170
anymore. I'm about to die and combust into a million pieces of dirt. Please stop. Oh my god,

556
02:18:56,170 --> 02:19:06,899
stop. I was playing hand simulator and like, nobody liked it. Thanks. Hey, uh, hip moose. We

557
02:19:06,899 --> 02:19:18,950
didn't see this five community subs from hip moose. Oh man. Thank you hip moose. Sad Vega,

558
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:22,469
thanks for 300 bits. I suffer from a condition where I get a lot of information and I suffer

559
02:19:22,469 --> 02:19:26,950
from it year round. I take a thousand milligram capsules of turmeric to help manage it. It helps

560
02:19:26,950 --> 02:19:31,909
a lot, but as a heads up, it's going to dehydrate the hell out of you, which means expect constipation

561
02:19:31,909 --> 02:19:40,260
if you don't drink tons of H2O. Yeah. Uh, what's probably going to end up happening here is I'm

562
02:19:40,260 --> 02:19:47,079
going to do, I'm going to do some, maybe try to do some supplements and stuff, but I'm probably

563
02:19:47,079 --> 02:19:51,659
going to start to go see a physical therapist because I know that there are some things to help,

564
02:19:52,459 --> 02:19:58,219
um, kind of unlock your joints a little bit, different stretches, different physical therapy

565
02:19:58,219 --> 02:20:09,860
you can do to help with this issue. Cause like I said before, it really does feel like

566
02:20:11,079 --> 02:20:17,639
I almost just need somebody to like press down and twist and then pull up and then twist and it'll

567
02:20:17,639 --> 02:20:22,680
be like, and I'll go back to normal. But I know that, I mean, that's just kind of how it feels.

568
02:20:23,479 --> 02:20:34,379
But even sometimes when I like, if I, if I lean back and I pull back a little, I can feel inside

569
02:20:34,379 --> 02:20:53,139
of my chest around to my back, like it's like, so that's what I get for shoplifting. That's what

570
02:20:53,139 --> 02:21:05,379
you get for stopping lifting. Oh, that's what you get for not lifting anymore. Well, it's actually

571
02:21:05,379 --> 02:21:12,940
a very good thing. I don't like lift any weights anymore. So I'll probably do some physical therapy,

572
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:20,260
see if we can move some shit around, see if I can do some stretches, try to loosen up

573
02:21:21,219 --> 02:21:24,739
these apparently inflamed joints. And yeah, I know that I've been told,

574
02:21:25,459 --> 02:21:30,899
the doctor told me you might get like a shot of cortisone, cortisol, whatever steroid into the

575
02:21:30,899 --> 02:21:36,180
bone, into your, that's not, that's not good for you though. I've heard that that's really not good

576
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:57,020
for you. We'll see what they say. I'd like to try physical therapy first. I've had that in my back

577
02:21:57,020 --> 02:22:05,860
and it's the second worst pain I've ever felt. Damn it. Oh well. Is the pain in your back or

578
02:22:05,860 --> 02:22:12,420
is it on your stomach? It's my whole entire core. So it starts right in the middle of my sternum,

579
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:19,299
right in my breastbone and then goes out inside that area around my ribs. And then it's all around

580
02:22:19,299 --> 02:22:24,420
the back of my ribs too, my whole back. Mostly, most pain is on like the right side of my back

581
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:32,649
into the center of my chest. This has been about a year and a half of dealing with it.

582
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:36,059
And something that I didn't really talk that much about because it was just like,

583
02:22:36,059 --> 02:22:38,299
ah, what is it? What would I, what is there even to talk about?

584
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:52,700
So it's just like a, just constant, just there always, but this last six months or so, I've

585
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:57,899
been really pushing hard, hard, hard, hammered hard to really try to figure out what the fuck

586
02:22:57,899 --> 02:23:09,020
is even going on with my body. And I, over the last, yeah, like six, seven, eight months straight,

587
02:23:09,739 --> 02:23:15,139
I've been trying to figure out what the fuck it is. And maybe one piece of that puzzle is the

588
02:23:15,139 --> 02:23:20,840
hernia, which is what I had, that's what I have. But the doctor also says it's probably both.

589
02:23:21,719 --> 02:23:43,639
His skeleton is hatching. But hey, we get it. When's the ball de-stream?

590
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:49,940
There's still blood all over my screen, by the way.

591
02:23:52,469 --> 02:24:14,360
We get it. Oh my God. You guys are ruthless. I, yeah, I've got this like fucking medical

592
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:18,360
problem that's like really been bothering me for like two years. Where's Baldi?

593
02:24:21,959 --> 02:24:32,379
Oh, it's something about it's like funny though. It kind of is to me. It's all good. Hey, thanks a

594
02:24:32,379 --> 02:24:37,270
lot, Frody and Weapon for the 256. It's hard to hear about the hernia and ribs. I'm sure you don't

595
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:39,909
need to hear it from me, but take it easy. If you need to, I'm sure you'll overcome it.

596
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:51,420
Yeah, from all the things I've heard about, if it is costochondritis, is that some, it's some,

597
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:59,670
for some people, it's around for like a few years and then it just disappears. Oh yeah,

598
02:24:59,670 --> 02:25:04,469
it's inflammation in your ribs, joint pain and joint problems inside your ribs. Oh, by the way,

599
02:25:04,469 --> 02:25:10,700
it's not, it's gone now. It's been four years and now it's just not there anymore. What? What the

600
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:29,959
hell? What are you talking? What? Your body just balks it out. Check and make sure it's not a heart

601
02:25:29,959 --> 02:25:41,430
thing. No, we've, we've eliminated every major organ in my body. At this point, I've had enough

602
02:25:41,430 --> 02:25:48,629
blood tests and scopes and it's not anything going. I don't, it's, it would be shocking to me if this

603
02:25:48,629 --> 02:26:05,540
was an organ problem. You need those. I know. Did you have an x-ray? Yes, I've had an MRI

604
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:16,920
and an x-ray of two different places and they confirmed a few things and there we go.

605
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:26,329
You want to look at, look at your x-rays on stream. Now that would probably be the strangest thing

606
02:26:26,329 --> 02:26:32,629
that you would ever see on Twitch. Has no one's ever done that? Like you want x-ray of my spine?

607
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:49,209
What, you want to pretend to know what I'm looking at? No, I'm not going to do that.

608
02:26:49,780 --> 02:27:05,219
That's super naked. That is naked 3.0. Put it up on your Reddit. Yeah, just make like a post.

609
02:27:05,219 --> 02:27:08,420
Hey guys, here's the result. Here's all my MRIs. What's wrong with me?

610
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:22,729
I'm not doing that. That is strange. That's strange. That's really strange. I can't do that.

611
02:27:22,729 --> 02:27:27,530
I can't do that. That's too fucked up for me. It's like, oh, here's like your x-rays of his back

612
02:27:27,530 --> 02:27:31,770
and spine and shit. It's like, I don't know. No, no, no. I, you, I don't want you guys to see,

613
02:27:31,770 --> 02:27:35,610
I don't want you guys to see me naked. I don't want you guys to see me times three naked.

614
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:46,340
Then my dream would just come true. But yeah, I have, I've got turmeric tea. I'm going to be

615
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:54,659
doing that. Drinking turmeric tea, probably taking some turmeric, try to eat more of an

616
02:27:54,659 --> 02:28:01,989
anti-inflammatory diet. That's hard to fucking do though. Like no dairy, no processed meats,

617
02:28:01,989 --> 02:28:10,549
no nothing fried, no gluten, no wheat. That's so no hydrogenated oils. If you live in 2019,

618
02:28:10,549 --> 02:28:20,899
it's actually really hard to avoid all of those things. Because half of the shit that you ever

619
02:28:20,899 --> 02:28:29,319
eat is just cooked in some kind of pressed oil. This is olive oil, which is, that's not inflammatory

620
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:39,879
or whatever. Just go vegan. I could never do it. I could never go vegetarian or vegan. I just,

621
02:28:39,879 --> 02:28:46,360
I could not do it. I couldn't do it. I'd go crazy after like a, like a month. I'd lose my mind.

622
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:54,739
I'd turn into like Gollum. I love certain foods and certain meats so much. I could not,

623
02:28:54,739 --> 02:29:08,469
I just would not be able to do it. Who's this? Hey Reddit, hey Jeremy, here are my MRI scans.

624
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:25,219
If you're a brand new viewer and you're brand new to that sub Reddit,

625
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:33,370
I'm, and you think that's me or something, you're gonna be, it's like, I, I, this person's like

626
02:29:33,370 --> 02:29:43,690
freaking me out. But anyways, uh, thank you SadVega for the 300 bits. Thank you Freuding Weapon for

627
02:29:43,690 --> 02:29:48,569
the 256. And thank you Gnarly for the 250. I had a hernia removed from my stomach when I was like six

628
02:29:48,569 --> 02:29:53,370
or seven. I don't remember anything, but the dream I had when I went under, I was on a steel bed in

629
02:29:53,370 --> 02:29:58,649
an empty room and a metal claw dug into my stomach and pulled my hernia out. It was a scary and

630
02:29:58,649 --> 02:30:11,930
painful dream, but I got a dual popsicle afterwards. So easy, 10 out of 10. Oh my God. Thank you. Please

631
02:30:11,930 --> 02:30:15,370
go out with my grandpa for the 500 bits. Hey Jeremy, just want to thank you for saving my

632
02:30:15,370 --> 02:30:19,770
relationship. Uh, me and my girlfriend have had some hard times together and I didn't think our

633
02:30:19,770 --> 02:30:34,200
relationship would last till we discovered the erotic, it's, um, it's hard to not, it's hard to

634
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:53,340
say this. Erotic, uh, no. No. Rat movie RP and since then our relationship is going strong.

635
02:30:53,340 --> 02:31:16,170
Thank you. She's a giant rat. Okay. Shitty Viewbot, thanks for the 400 bits. Seems good. Hey,

636
02:31:16,170 --> 02:31:20,649
Jerma, since this is the week of co-op and you might need some game recommendations, might as

637
02:31:20,649 --> 02:31:25,540
well just pay day one and two. Uh, you decide whether you want to play or not and I hope your

638
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:32,100
hernia gets better. Me too. Um, well I know for the next day or two it's going to be Halo Reach.

639
02:31:33,719 --> 02:31:38,040
After the stream tomorrow I think we'll probably just come to a consensus if we're just going to

640
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:45,719
do it the next stream. Maybe, uh, Joel and I will be like, oh that was fun, that was cool, but

641
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:51,030
maybe we don't want to finish it together. Maybe I would just, if he wasn't into it doing it again,

642
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:56,780
I would just do the rest. Something like that. We'll find out. And then there's another co-op

643
02:31:56,780 --> 02:32:00,059
game that's already lined up. If that doesn't work though, then we'll probably look for something

644
02:32:00,059 --> 02:32:17,379
else. Thank you. For the 400 bits. Uh, P flavor, thanks for the 300 bits. Jerma, I keep missing

645
02:32:17,379 --> 02:32:22,579
your streams so stop streaming when I can't watch. Also here's your 6% Jerma tax. Sorry it's late,

646
02:32:22,579 --> 02:32:33,780
please don't hurt my family. You say, you say this every time. Don't, this is like two or three of

647
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:42,200
you that have the same end to your messages. Hey, the coldest fridge, thanks for the 500 bits. Hi

648
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:45,719
Jerma, you told me that you would say happy birthday to me on stream three years ago,

649
02:32:45,719 --> 02:33:02,090
but you never did. What? I just like put the phone in the back and put it, like throw it down there

650
02:33:02,090 --> 02:33:07,530
and just have it. No, that's fucking weird. That's a good reverse surveillance video.

651
02:33:12,250 --> 02:33:15,979
All right. Good night, everybody. Coldest bridge. Thanks for the $1.

652
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:20,149
Well, thanks for the $2 actually. Jerma, can I get a happy birthday message?

653
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:29,340
Uh, December 6th, like Nicholas. I'm going to have to start doing like, all right, I remember that.

654
02:33:30,059 --> 02:33:38,139
December 6th? What's going on on the 6th? I don't know. Remind me. Siri, remind me in six days

655
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:46,739
to say happy birthday to the coldest fridge. Saved it. Got it. Thanks for the $3 coldest fridge.

656
02:33:46,739 --> 02:33:49,700
That's one, two, three in a row. Okay, for real, thank you for the coolest beans stream.

657
02:33:52,780 --> 02:34:04,069
Right. And that's three years ago. So in three days, it's your, it's your birthday again.

658
02:34:05,049 --> 02:34:11,719
I've got another chance. I didn't mean I was going to say happy birthday to you

659
02:34:12,700 --> 02:34:19,930
on your 25th birthday. I was talking about happy birthday on your 28th birthday. Remind me.

660
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:28,520
Siri, make a note here. Remind me on December 6th to say happy birthday to the coldest fridge.

661
02:34:31,450 --> 02:34:45,000
Got it. There it is. Thanks for the 500 bits. Appreciate it. Stinky beaver. Thanks for the $2.50,

662
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:54,379
6% tax. Frank West and TK for a Jerma Rumble. Why is everything 6%? Why do I, why do I have to

663
02:34:54,379 --> 02:35:09,770
take 6% of your money? What? Is that the number that we agreed upon somehow? 6% tax? I said that?

664
02:35:09,770 --> 02:35:23,239
Oh, not a bad number. Hey, uh, Firo Swee. Thanks for the 400 bits. Dude, Jerma, thank you for

665
02:35:23,239 --> 02:35:33,110
streaming on my birthday. Happy birthday. We've got one right now. It's Firo's birthday. Happy

666
02:35:33,110 --> 02:35:45,590
birthday, Firo. Hope you had a good one. Happy birthday. Uh, Midna says, thanks for the 500 bits.

667
02:35:46,229 --> 02:35:50,739
Hey, Jerma, I don't usually watch full streams due to my work schedule and only heard about

668
02:35:50,739 --> 02:35:54,819
your medical procedure through SUS last week. Hope everything went well and you're feeling

669
02:35:54,819 --> 02:36:04,260
better. Thanks for streaming. Yeah, I'm doing all right. I'm at the stage right now where I'm,

670
02:36:05,319 --> 02:36:09,639
the, the light at the end of the tunnel is starting to open and I'm going, I can see through that.

671
02:36:10,729 --> 02:36:14,649
I can see it. The beams kind of just hit me right in the eye and it's like, oh, oh, oh,

672
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:18,969
oh, it's so bright. And I'm, I'm going, I'm walking towards it. No, that's not a good,

673
02:36:18,969 --> 02:36:25,450
that's a bad analogy. That means that, that means I'm dead. That's a terrible, no, no, the light at

674
02:36:25,450 --> 02:36:31,780
the end. Don't go into the light, Jeremy. Don't go into the light. Go the other way. Open the door

675
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:39,430
that you came through. Uh, go away from the light. Right. Uh, I'm getting to the end of the road

676
02:36:39,430 --> 02:36:50,170
here. That also is not a great analogy. Okay. I know what might be wrong with me. They're done.

677
02:36:50,170 --> 02:36:58,920
So therefore, hopefully the next couple of months solutions start to be put in place as to this

678
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:04,360
fucking dumb mystery illness. So I kind of have some answers now. There you go. That's better than

679
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:18,200
don't walk towards the light. But yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine. It's not a significant

680
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:25,180
enough problem to really affect my day to day life. It's just kind of there. And I always know

681
02:37:25,180 --> 02:37:31,879
it's there and it's just irritating, but it's not, it doesn't necessarily affect too much of my

682
02:37:31,879 --> 02:37:41,100
actual day to day to day life. It just kind of hurts sometimes. It's just kind of, it just,

683
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:45,500
like, it just hurts a little. Not enough to really, you know, it just hurts a little. That's it.

684
02:37:49,750 --> 02:37:58,520
Am I colorblind? I don't think so. But I appreciate it. Thank you. Hey, Flugboy,

685
02:37:58,520 --> 02:38:02,280
thanks for the 250. You know how long I've been in this community. I thought I had seen everything

686
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:07,239
and I'm sure you've seen it by now, but someone put the fucking picture of you crying on their

687
02:38:07,239 --> 02:38:12,459
credit card. I love this community with all my heart and they never cease to amaze me.

688
02:38:13,100 --> 02:38:29,379
All right. But here's the thing. They, you have to hand that to the cashier. The cashier doesn't

689
02:38:29,379 --> 02:38:36,569
know who I am. So I am almost taken completely out of that equation. That's the thing between

690
02:38:36,569 --> 02:38:49,100
you and that cashier. They don't know me. And if they do, that you just surprised us the surprise

691
02:38:49,100 --> 02:39:29,739
of the century. Somebody just leaked it. Okay. What the fuck, man? That's so fucking ridiculous.

692
02:39:31,739 --> 02:39:35,739
Dunkin' Donuts. How does it look? Here's some Dunkin' Donuts because you have good news. You

693
02:39:35,739 --> 02:39:54,940
can upload custom photos on Dunkin' Donuts gift cards. It's here. You guys are fucking,

694
02:39:54,940 --> 02:40:02,579
you guys are fucking hilarious. But what's that person that you give it to?

695
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:14,729
Because you're epic. That's how I read that. Here's some Dunkin' Donuts. Because you're

696
02:40:14,729 --> 02:40:28,200
epic. That's how I see it. Now, you know, put it in a greeting card now. You know those cards

697
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:34,340
that you open and they just talk. Put that, get that sound bite into a greeting card.

698
02:40:34,340 --> 02:40:38,260
Put the Dunkin' Donuts card in there. And when it's opened, it plays that really shitty low

699
02:40:38,260 --> 02:40:53,139
bitrate quality audio. I mean, you have my permission. We are almost at the end.

700
02:40:53,700 --> 02:41:02,469
Let's get the credits rolling as they do. Let's move the scene over to here. Let's roll the

701
02:41:02,469 --> 02:41:11,270
credits. Thanks for watching. Thanks for the subs. Holy shit. That's a lot of subs. I was gone for

702
02:41:11,270 --> 02:41:17,620
about four days. So look at all these racked up subs. You guys are fucking awesome. Thank you.

703
02:41:17,620 --> 02:41:23,879
Thanks for the support. Thanks for streaming. Thank you for streaming, guys. I really loved

704
02:41:23,879 --> 02:41:34,059
that hand simulator stream. It was great. No, thank you for real. All of you. Let's head back

705
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:43,290
to the bits. Let's finish them up. Flugboy, thanks for the 250. You know how long I've been

706
02:41:43,290 --> 02:41:46,969
in this community. I've seen everything and I'm sure you've seen it by now, but somebody put the

707
02:41:46,969 --> 02:41:51,129
fucking picture of you crying on their credit card. I love this community with all my heart and

708
02:41:51,129 --> 02:41:56,090
they never cease to amaze me. What? Somebody put it on the what somebody put my that image on

709
02:41:56,090 --> 02:42:09,379
a what do you mean that image? You have a link? Hey, mad. Thanks for the 1500 bits mad. No, I'm

710
02:42:09,379 --> 02:42:14,899
not kidding. Thank you, mad. Thanks for the 1500 bits. So it was my birthday on Thanksgiving,

711
02:42:14,899 --> 02:42:21,780
which had a good meal. So here's your obligatory 10%. It was 6% must have gotten that incorrect.

712
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:25,379
Please let me out of your basement, Mr. Comedy Man. It's getting dark in here. Okay.

713
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:43,579
Okay. Oh, he spelled it. M-O-N-K-U-H. Monka S with two S's. Uh, phylactery. I missed

714
02:42:44,139 --> 02:42:51,209
5000 bits from phylactery. Thanks for the $50 phylactery. Again, again, again, again, again,

715
02:42:51,209 --> 02:43:01,209
50, 50, 50, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100. Thank you. And you say $50 for playing spill joke the game.

716
02:43:01,209 --> 02:43:04,899
Love you, Jeremy. That level was huge. I didn't think it was gonna be that big.

717
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:19,770
It was 500 last time. Yeah. Yeah, it was. And who could forget Bob Boy? Bob Boy 61. I mean,

718
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:26,889
out of out of the potentially just thousands and thousands and thousands of community members,

719
02:43:26,889 --> 02:43:33,370
Bob Boy 61 has got to be up there at least in like the top in the top like fucking

720
02:43:34,170 --> 02:43:57,659
two to 300,000 people. Thank you, Bob Boy for the five subs. Appreciate it. You rank us. He's

721
02:43:57,659 --> 02:44:03,500
picking favorites now. Yeah, he's in the top like two to three. How many people actually think,

722
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:07,909
watch this channel? I have no idea. How many people follow this channel? Two what?

723
02:44:09,459 --> 02:44:12,579
250 something, 270. How many, how many followers are on this channel?

724
02:44:13,299 --> 02:44:21,000
Well, I can't, I'm too, I'm too lazy to click over here apparently. How many followers do I have?

725
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:29,819
265,000 followers. Okay. So yeah, I, Bob Boy's definitely in somewhere in the top like 300,000.

726
02:44:29,819 --> 02:44:48,149
That's a flex. How's that? What do you mean? How's that flex? Do a tier list of all your viewers,

727
02:44:48,149 --> 02:45:01,100
all everyone that's followed. That would take probably five years to do that. If I did it

728
02:45:01,100 --> 02:45:05,159
every single stream and it would never be finished because people would know that the stream was

729
02:45:05,159 --> 02:45:11,959
happening and they would continue to make new accounts and follow. I would in the first week

730
02:45:11,959 --> 02:45:20,569
of doing that stream, I would probably get 10,000 new followers. It would never end. You guys are

731
02:45:20,569 --> 02:45:27,059
all up at, hold on. I don't want, wait a minute. I don't want you to think, you know, I don't want

732
02:45:27,059 --> 02:45:32,920
you. Well, you, everyone, everyone's asked here. I don't know if I could say that. What about the

733
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:37,079
person that came in here and they may be followed the channel. They called me like a idiot like two

734
02:45:37,079 --> 02:45:50,379
days ago. Is that person on S tier? This is not you making the tier list. This is me making the

735
02:45:50,379 --> 02:46:06,629
tier list. Everyone except him. Yeah. Everybody except that person. Who is it though? I don't know.

736
02:46:07,430 --> 02:46:17,659
M-O-N-K-U-H space B-S-S. I don't know. Who is it? Thank you back in for the 300 bits. Hi,

737
02:46:17,659 --> 02:46:22,940
Jerma. Thanks for streaming as always. I'm losing, uh, I'm losing cognition more and more,

738
02:46:22,940 --> 02:46:26,950
but hopefully my upcoming appointment should help maybe. Anyways, I hope you and Chad have a

739
02:46:26,950 --> 02:46:41,610
wonderful day. Thanks for the 300 bits back in. Let's send some love and energy over to back in.

740
02:46:45,430 --> 02:47:00,700
Thanks for the 300 bits. Hope you have a wonderful day. Take care. Thank you so much for the 300

741
02:47:00,700 --> 02:47:18,569
bits. Send some Jerma hearts over to back in please. There we go. That's what I like to see.

742
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:35,219
That's what I like to see. Also, thank you to snoozingcopter for the 250. Hey, Jerma,

743
02:47:35,219 --> 02:47:37,620
missed the beginning of the streams. I haven't heard the medical updates yet. Hope you're all

744
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:45,879
right. However, I wanted to say something else. You've been robbed. Oh no, there's more. There's

745
02:47:45,879 --> 02:47:53,180
more. There's more. There's more. Any stories that you could share? I, I've, no, I've never

746
02:47:53,180 --> 02:48:01,239
been robbed before. They said my girlfriend recently got her phone snatched out of her hands.

747
02:48:03,260 --> 02:48:07,739
Holy shit, that's horrible. Currently seeing if they can access the cameras.

748
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:12,620
But it was a real shock. Some people are unbelievable. Also play Disco Elcium. Do it.

749
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:25,559
I just started it and I swear to god this game is made for you. Um, no, well, I've never been,

750
02:48:25,559 --> 02:48:28,680
I've never been robbed. Like somebody comes up to you and says, hey,

751
02:48:28,680 --> 02:48:48,540
give me your money or something. That's never happened. But Disco Elcium. I, I, maybe. That's

752
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:52,700
been kind of just sitting there. I feel like Disco Elcium is going to be dusk. I'm not going

753
02:48:52,700 --> 02:48:56,139
to play it for like a year and then I'll play it and it'll be one of my favorite games I played

754
02:48:56,139 --> 02:49:09,370
the whole year. That's kind of what happened with dusk. So that just count on it. Count on it. Hey,

755
02:49:09,370 --> 02:49:14,250
Bobo Durago. Thanks for the 500 bits they say. Sup Jerma, I'm playing Apex Legends right now.

756
02:49:14,809 --> 02:49:20,250
I absolutely love the game. Have you ever played it? I have not. Also nice stream and also my

757
02:49:20,250 --> 02:49:31,270
username is pronounced Bobo Durango. Please say it. There's no N. It's, it's, it's Bobo Durago.

758
02:49:36,379 --> 02:49:38,860
What have I done? What do you mean? What have I done? What did I do? What did I do?

759
02:49:47,430 --> 02:49:53,270
Okay. Everyone's like, Oh my God. He said, like, okay, do you understand saying names out loud

760
02:49:53,270 --> 02:49:59,459
that I, that I, I have many panic attacks when it's like, wait, he said it. He, he said the thing.

761
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:09,700
What did I say? What happened? Where? What did I do? It's like every like seven names or every

762
02:50:09,700 --> 02:50:14,020
like 10 names is that one like panic attack moment where it's like, did somebody just phonetically

763
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:25,770
make me say something horrible? No, no, no, right? No, no, no. Okay. No. But no, I've never played

764
02:50:25,770 --> 02:50:38,280
Apex. I'm not really into the BR thing was never my cup of tea. I heard, I heard that it was fun

765
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:49,879
if you liked BRs. But then I heard that it was not fun anymore. You won PUBG mobile on stream.

766
02:50:49,879 --> 02:50:54,549
Yeah, but I only played PUBG mobile for like two weeks and then I just deleted it and never played

767
02:50:54,549 --> 02:51:07,100
it again. But hey, KXE, thanks for the $20, 2000 bits from KXE. No message. Thank you.

768
02:51:07,899 --> 02:51:16,809
Thanks for the 2000 bits. Uh, Squimpist, thanks for the 250. Hey Jermbo, just wanted to say,

769
02:51:16,809 --> 02:51:21,850
I know chronic illnesses, pains. They're no joke. And I'm sorry about the bozos in chat who are mean

770
02:51:21,850 --> 02:51:32,489
about it. Living with these things can be tough, but you're tougher. Godspeed. Yeah, but here's the

771
02:51:32,489 --> 02:51:43,340
thing. It's not. I've had an annoying chronic illness for like more than 10 years. I, I kind

772
02:51:43,340 --> 02:51:54,600
of know what to expect. I've had irritable bowel disease. It's just for, I don't know how long. I

773
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:59,479
was like a, I was a junior senior in college when I first had to start, started having the problems.

774
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:11,739
But that's, that's what 10, 12, 12 plus years ago, something like that. So, you know, I, it's, it's,

775
02:52:11,739 --> 02:52:27,100
it is what it is. It is what it is. I'm just going to keep just, uh, kicking at it. You know what I

776
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:35,209
mean? Till I start to get some answers and some real solutions, right? Which those should be

777
02:52:35,209 --> 02:52:43,290
starting very soon. Hey SaranRaps, thank you for the 300 bits. Hey Jerma, thanks for streaming despite

778
02:52:43,290 --> 02:52:54,860
your health problems. Is the game Rain World on your radar? Rain World? Uh, what is Rain World?

779
02:52:55,579 --> 02:53:12,149
Not Rim, not Rim World, right? I know Rain World. What is this game? This looks pretty cool.

780
02:53:12,149 --> 02:53:23,459
Wow, are you like a little fox or something? Wayne's World? No. I'll punch that into Steam

781
02:53:23,459 --> 02:53:33,700
after the stream, see what it looks like. It's very cute, very hard. But I mean, I, on stream,

782
02:53:35,540 --> 02:53:48,969
I completed after only, on hard. So I think I'll be all right. It'd make a good what do I do stream

783
02:53:48,969 --> 02:53:58,979
game. That's cool. Hey Gondolin, thanks for the 250. Hey Chumer, Chad plus Boomer, will you do a

784
02:53:58,979 --> 02:54:04,950
video game award stream with your villain hair? Nah, I'll probably have a haircut by then. I'll

785
02:54:04,950 --> 02:54:14,360
have a haircut by then. Thank you Gondolin, appreciate it. Thank you Saturn for the 500 bits.

786
02:54:14,360 --> 02:54:18,360
Hey Jerma, it's inspiring that you have these health issues, like IBS, hernias, and back

787
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:22,520
problems, but you still get up and entertain us where others may not even get out of bed.

788
02:54:22,520 --> 02:54:34,700
Much love. Here's the thing though. This is one of the, this is probably in the top one, two,

789
02:54:34,700 --> 02:54:45,739
or three things that I care about in the whole world. I have to. It's, I care so much about

790
02:54:45,739 --> 02:54:54,969
doing this. I have so much fun. This is so interesting to me that I, I would, I would

791
02:54:54,969 --> 02:54:57,530
rather be doing this than something, anything else. You know what I mean?

792
02:55:03,379 --> 02:55:09,799
And it's, it's not, don't get me wrong. It's not a scenario where I'm getting up and like forcing

793
02:55:09,799 --> 02:55:17,129
myself to turn a stream on and I'm not healthy or happy or anything. No, that's not the case at all.

794
02:55:21,379 --> 02:55:25,860
If that was the case, I just wouldn't do it. I just wouldn't turn the stream on,

795
02:55:28,489 --> 02:55:32,649
which I've done many times, many, many, many times. I've pushed a stream, delayed a stream,

796
02:55:32,649 --> 02:55:36,329
said, you know what? No, we're going to, we're going to do like three days, like Tuesday,

797
02:55:36,329 --> 02:55:39,370
Wednesday, Thursday, instead of what I said, I would, you know, I'm not feeling it today.

798
02:55:39,370 --> 02:55:55,540
I do it all the time. So do not worry about that at all. It's not, I'm not in a position right now

799
02:55:55,540 --> 02:56:03,659
where it's a major, major, major issue or anything. It's just a minor problem that's going to take.

800
02:56:04,540 --> 02:56:09,100
Here's the thing. It's some, it's a minor problem. That's going to take some potential major changes

801
02:56:09,100 --> 02:56:20,680
for me to fix. Right. Then that's what you get. That's what you do. But I do appreciate it.

802
02:56:20,680 --> 02:56:32,260
Appreciate the concern. Do not worry. Thank you produces. Thank you produces San for the 500 bits.

803
02:56:32,979 --> 02:56:38,059
Want to thank you for making me laugh so much. This time when I have, there's times where I haven't

804
02:56:38,059 --> 02:56:47,219
laughed so hard. Oh, sorry about that. I got like a bubble in my throat. Okay. Uh, there's time where

805
02:56:47,219 --> 02:56:51,000
I haven't laughed so hard in my life. Thanks to you. It's been really making my days that much

806
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:55,399
better considering where I am now. Uh, kind of lost and drifting at the moment, trying to find

807
02:56:55,399 --> 02:56:59,399
my place. But these laughs are well worth making me know the world is still turning.

808
02:57:00,200 --> 02:57:03,799
And also the burger king has the whopper junior, which has the same great taste as the regular

809
02:57:03,799 --> 02:57:13,879
whopper for a dollar 50, except it's fucking tiny. It's a small sandwich. Okay. It's, uh, it's a

810
02:57:13,879 --> 02:57:21,319
whopper junior is, um, just, uh, Wendy's bacon, uh, Wendy's junior bacon. What the fuck? What's the,

811
02:57:21,319 --> 02:57:25,079
what's the thing called with the huge bunch of lettuce on it? And they've got rid of the lettuce.

812
02:57:25,879 --> 02:57:29,399
They changed it recently. It's just a tomato now. What's called the junior bacon cheeseburger

813
02:57:37,299 --> 02:57:45,989
from Wendy's. I like, did they change the recipe or something? Cause I remember it had lettuce on

814
02:57:45,989 --> 02:57:55,340
it and I didn't get lettuce last time. Wendy's is not kosher. Is any fast is, is McDonald's and

815
02:57:55,340 --> 02:58:11,860
Burger King kosher? I don't think it is. No, McDonald's is not kosher. And what do you mean

816
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:25,620
kosher McDonald's and Burger King? There are rats. I can't even say that out loud because I don't

817
02:58:25,620 --> 02:58:38,040
want to get like sued. Uh, there are rats in rat movie too. It's a fun movie. Only two or three

818
02:58:38,040 --> 02:58:45,159
more to do. We've got, uh, shades fen, shades fen for two 50. Hey German, watching your VR stream

819
02:58:45,159 --> 02:58:49,000
videos lately and didn't remember just how funny they were. You're going to do more VR before

820
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:56,840
half-life Alex. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Also ever since the, uh, I'm Jeremy Lammy and Parappa streams

821
02:58:56,840 --> 02:59:01,479
have been massively hooked on the OST, especially the Jeremy Lammy one can never thank you enough

822
02:59:01,479 --> 02:59:05,479
for all the laughs and introduced me to such an awesome music. Can't wait to see what you have in

823
02:59:05,479 --> 02:59:15,579
store for us during December. I'll put these kids to sleep. Will you? Yes. There will be a, another

824
02:59:15,579 --> 02:59:23,159
VR stream before a half-life Alex and by I'll probably just do, it'll be one of those scenarios

825
02:59:23,159 --> 02:59:30,739
where, uh, is this even playing? Why is the music stopped? Okay. That was weird. Uh, it'll be a

826
02:59:30,739 --> 02:59:39,610
scenario where we'll do like another five, 10 games over the course of a week. So yeah, I,

827
02:59:40,329 --> 02:59:47,829
absolutely. And I will be, and I will be one of the, every single streamer on the website

828
02:59:47,829 --> 03:00:01,930
that's doing half-life Alex at launch. Yes, they will. But thank you. Also, this is, uh, from

829
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:15,239
uh, Flugboy. It's a Twitter link and it's, it's the Dunkin Donuts gift card. This has 17,000 likes

830
03:00:15,879 --> 03:00:21,639
and has been retweeted five fucking thousand times. I thought this was just like a few dozen of you

831
03:00:21,639 --> 03:00:52,329
thought this was funny. What? What the fuck? Link the tweet. Uh, this five, I can't even get like

832
03:00:52,329 --> 03:01:08,940
5,000 retweets on anything. Oh my God. It's cause you don't tweet. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I

833
03:01:08,940 --> 03:01:20,500
know. But when I do, when I do, that's so funny. And then the other tweet is the, the debit card,

834
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:34,950
the credit card. So I think somebody linked the picture already, but am I going to do Boneworks?

835
03:01:35,989 --> 03:01:39,510
Yeah. If I'm going to do Boneworks, I need the new controllers though. I have to get those

836
03:01:39,510 --> 03:01:50,010
index controllers. The game was made for it. When you do go viral, it's the mom baking cookies

837
03:01:50,010 --> 03:02:00,540
of the drawstring tweets. Going viral. I'm going, Hey mom, I'm going viral. If you get the index

838
03:02:00,540 --> 03:02:04,540
controls before Christmas, you get Alex for free. Is this really, that's a pretty good deal.

839
03:02:07,690 --> 03:02:14,950
All right guys, we'll see you tomorrow. Joel and I are going to try to attempt to play, uh,

840
03:02:14,950 --> 03:02:24,020
Halo Reach co-op. What did I just do? That's the wrong thing. It's this one. So see you tomorrow.

841
03:02:24,020 --> 03:02:27,059
If something comes up for some reason, then we'll probably figure something else out.

842
03:02:28,020 --> 03:02:38,709
Flugboy, thanks for the 250 right at the end here. I know I didn't add a caption that last one,

843
03:02:38,709 --> 03:02:42,709
but I'm sure that you know what those links are by now. I hope you have a good rest of your night.

844
03:02:42,709 --> 03:02:47,030
Wish me luck on my finals. Please. I really need it. Good luck on your finals. Hopefully you studied.

845
03:02:47,030 --> 03:02:54,059
Hopefully you get that information we walked in. Thanks for the 250. Good luck on your finals,

846
03:02:54,059 --> 03:03:05,530
Flugboy. Oh, Jerma real quick before you go, be ready for Reach not to work because it has

847
03:03:05,610 --> 03:03:10,649
peer-to-peer connections. Well, that's bad. We're going to test it to make sure it does work.

848
03:03:11,290 --> 03:03:19,540
And if it doesn't, then we'll figure something out. It is, you know what? You are right. It is

849
03:03:19,540 --> 03:03:28,340
day one launch day of a brand new video game in 2019. It's guaranteed to not fucking work

850
03:03:28,340 --> 03:03:35,659
as intended for at least six or seven days. Technically day two. You're right.

851
03:03:36,620 --> 03:03:45,620
Halo brand new video game. Well, you know what I mean? Like a brand new launch.

852
03:03:46,260 --> 03:03:50,579
That's been, it's a brand new, it's a launch of a game that has a lot of multiplayer connections.

853
03:03:51,459 --> 03:03:57,340
We'll see. See you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves. Thanks for joining me on the

854
03:03:57,340 --> 03:04:03,420
hand simulator. I'm medieval and visceral clean of detail. Triple stream. That's right. You got

855
03:04:03,420 --> 03:04:14,950
three streams in one today. Stream three separate streams in one stream. Now I don't granted.

856
03:04:15,989 --> 03:04:23,579
It was the first, the first hour and 40 minutes. Uh, for a lot of you was like having your teeth

857
03:04:23,579 --> 03:04:31,959
pulled without novocaine, but it was fun. The streams, not even cannon. That's right. The

858
03:04:31,959 --> 03:04:37,559
streams, not cannon. This is an expanded universe stream because I wasn't even going to scream

859
03:04:37,559 --> 03:04:43,399
today, but I was like, you know what? Fuck it. Let's go. Let's play hand simulator and piss off

860
03:04:43,399 --> 03:04:50,600
an entire community. That sounds like a good idea. Good night guys. See you tomorrow. Have a

861
03:04:50,600 --> 03:05:04,379
wonderful rest of your night. Take care. Somebody said, didn't even try a hand simulator multiplayer.

862
03:05:05,180 --> 03:05:13,079
They were burning my house down. I had to leave. Maybe I'll play it again in multiplayer.

863
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:26,120
Maybe you'll see it again. Fuck it. We'll do it. Halo reach. Let's go play with Joel. Yeah,

864
03:05:26,120 --> 03:05:31,270
that's what's happening. Do you remember when me and Joel did the gamer challenge?

865
03:05:31,909 --> 03:05:37,750
We made the gamer challenge like a year ago. Let's go. Gamer challenge activated. They're

866
03:05:37,750 --> 03:05:45,209
going to be co-op game. Let's go. What time? Somewhere. Oh, let me see. I actually have it.

867
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:52,020
This also be correct, but just for you to know, be the first to know.

868
03:05:52,659 --> 03:06:01,340
A year in the, it's a year in the works. It'll be, so because we're working

869
03:06:02,459 --> 03:06:08,149
around both of our like streaming schedule, streaming times, it's going to be somewhere

870
03:06:08,149 --> 03:06:19,110
around four PST. Joel doesn't have a schedule. Neither do I. So when you have two non-schedules

871
03:06:19,110 --> 03:06:26,090
run into each other, you got to pick a time here. 4 p.m pacific state tomorrow. Good night. Take care.
