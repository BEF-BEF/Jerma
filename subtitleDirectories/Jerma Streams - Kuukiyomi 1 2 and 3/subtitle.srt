1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,030
Hey, I'm here. Yep. Sorry. I had to take a phone call.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,539
I had a phone call. I had to take. I couldn't ignore it.

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,660
Sorry.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,660
Okay. Sorry. I might have to clear my throat.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,410
So today, hello. Hi.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,480
What's up?

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,160
Welcome to the stream.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,500
Hope you had a good week.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
I did. I think I had a pretty good week.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,210
Here on the weekend now.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,210
To hang out with you.

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,939
And play video games.

13
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,240
Aren't you ready?

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Uh, we have a few things to do this weekend.

15
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,619
Today, we're gonna play this game called Considerate.

16
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,969
It's a game kind of like WarioWare.

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,539
I'm really into the micro game stuff right now.

18
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,219
The only difference is the choices you make in this game

19
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,099
are based on how nice of a person you are.

20
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,409
How considerate you are.

21
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:12,739
And to get rated at the end of how considerate of a person you are.

22
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,969
Based on the micro games.

23
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:18,969
So I, it looks cool.

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,500
Resident Sleeper.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,579
I was, oh wow, he's gonna scream.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,200
One day I will do that.

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,120
One day I'm gonna see a Resident Sleeper and I'm gonna go

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Just like scream into the fucking microphone.

29
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:37,049
So that person is, because they just pressed enter.

30
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,769
And now it's like, holy shit, I just did Resident Sleeper.

31
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,730
And this motherfucker screamed.

32
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,519
And I can see it scrolling up the chat.

33
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,280
So I was wrong.

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,519
I'm not, how do I delete my chat room?

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,140
Oh shit, you're right, thank you.

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:05,290
Is this the guy from Bloodwigs?

37
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,129
Wait, Bloodwigs, what?

38
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:10,340
Yeah, I'm the guy, I'm the guy that likes to work with Bloodwigs.

39
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm just, I stream with like another room.

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,689
Let me tweet.

41
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,629
Okay, tweet is out.

42
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:27,909
Now I can talk about what we're doing.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,099
Where's my tweet?

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,689
What the fuck?

45
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:38,819
Here we go, okay, see it.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,150
All right, what about Deltarune?

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,949
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,629
Hey, hold on, let me, let me move the clock.

49
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:47,590
I almost said the clock.

50
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,620
It's a microphone.

51
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,689
It's not a clock.

52
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:52,889
Let me move the clock.

53
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:57,400
Hold on, there.

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Let me move the mic closer to my face so I don't have to lean in.

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,240
So we're going to play Considerate.

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,280
There's three of them.

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,919
I think they're both, the three of them are like an hour each.

58
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,759
Maybe Considering?

59
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,479
I don't know.

60
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,819
We're going to do them.

61
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,139
I'm going to get bored of them, or maybe not.

62
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,819
And if we do get bored, then we're going to move on to Roswell Agent,

63
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,300
which is the third person FBI game where you drive around and you're an agent.

64
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,539
And it's about an alien invasion.

65
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,800
And there's a car in it, so you know how we feel about those.

66
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,960
And then I was going to play Deltarune tomorrow,

67
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,159
but Deltarune is going to be next weekend,

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,830
because I want to play Chapter One,

69
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,430
because I think it's been a long time between chapters,

70
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,550
and I want to make sure I know what the fuck I'm talking about,

71
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,460
because I don't remember a goddamn thing.

72
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,020
The only thing I remember is I beat that clown.

73
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,860
I beat Jevil first try.

74
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,939
I don't know anything else, and I kind of want to refresh her.

75
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:59,580
So off stream, I'm going to play Deltarune Chapter One before next weekend,

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,580
and then obviously we'll do Chapter Two next weekend.

77
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,659
Also next weekend, we're finally going to do the Sims 3 modded hell.

78
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,860
I have like 10 game changing mods, just like I did in the fourth game.

79
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,459
Sims 4, you get the idea.

80
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,300
We'll do that next weekend as well.

81
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,860
So there's your Friday, Saturday for next weekend.

82
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,790
Friday, Saturday for this weekend, however, is going to be this game,

83
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,110
the FBI game, and then tomorrow we're going to probably play the pawn shop game.

84
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,269
No umbrellas allowed.

85
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,110
It's a pawn shop simulator.

86
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,470
I think it looks pretty fun.

87
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,639
You're going to play Diablo?

88
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,160
I'm not going to stream Diablo 2.

89
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,470
No, I streamed Diablo 2 earlier last year or the year before.

90
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,310
I don't need to do it again.

91
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,000
That's pretty based.

92
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,110
I just don't think I need to stream it.

93
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,899
It's going to be hard for me to even play Diablo 2.

94
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,209
There's a lot going on right now.

95
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,029
It's not like my days of yesteryear where I would stay up

96
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,189
till like four in the morning playing Diablo 2.

97
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,949
Like 10 hours.

98
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,750
Those days are probably long gone.

99
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,709
Especially now with all this kind of stuff going on.

100
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,209
Projects.

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,560
Maybe I'll talk about that at some point.

102
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,750
Yeah, let's go.

103
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,149
Let's go.

104
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,790
I got this game ready.

105
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,350
Toby Fox referenced you on the stream?

106
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,800
Yeah, I know.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,439
It was pretty cool.

108
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,120
I didn't even...

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,000
It's weird.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,920
It's weird when somebody that you think is like cool,

111
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,720
or like, holy shit, Undertale.

112
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,480
Toby Fox, that guy's fucking legendary.

113
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,310
Like, he said my name.

114
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,860
That's like Brad Pitt saying your name.

115
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,620
That's like going to the red carpet

116
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,139
and standing there with like a microphone

117
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,579
and like waiting for an interview.

118
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,699
And Brad Pitt walks by everybody else,

119
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:15,060
makes direct eye contact with you on the red carpet,

120
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,339
walks straight up to you and goes,

121
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,389
I know you, bro.

122
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:20,459
I know you.

123
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,899
And you're like, what the...

124
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,779
Hey, Brad Pitt.

125
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:25,920
Yeah.

126
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,180
Yeah, I do.

127
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,399
Hey, enjoy the movie.

128
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,519
And they fucking just keep walking.

129
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,050
It's like, holy shit, Brad Pitt.

130
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,930
How do you know who I am?

131
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,389
You're the worst streamer.

132
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,439
Ego Andy.

133
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,259
No, not Ego Andy.

134
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,019
You didn't even see the movements I was doing.

135
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,459
Do you understand the movements I was just making?

136
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,519
I was just going like...

137
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,240
Okay, I was going like this with the microphone in my hand.

138
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,800
Hey, hey, Brad Pitt, how are you?

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,920
That's not Ego Andy.

140
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
That's like holy shit, Andy.

141
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,480
You know what I mean?

142
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,000
That's not Ego Andy.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,029
I was shaking.

144
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,829
Okay, I'll be honest.

145
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:14,949
When I first opened this,

146
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,110
I thought it was an iPhone game that I had to flip up like left.

147
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:23,910
I really thought this was like an iPhone.

148
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,230
My orientation is wrong.

149
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,949
But no, this is correct.

150
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:35,420
First, I was like, why is my resolution so wrong?

151
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,740
Okay, so I think we're ready.

152
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,420
I'm ready to play Consider It.

153
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,069
Good afternoon.

154
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:40,629
Good afternoon.

155
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,480
Go camera again.

156
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,160
You'll get it in waves.

157
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,899
All right, let's play.

158
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,779
Do you want to use the mouse?

159
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:50,550
I don't think I use the mouse.

160
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:57,079
This is a space where you are free to consider things as you like.

161
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,000
There is no one here to stop you from being as considerate as you, please.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,019
Now what?

163
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:12,980
After considering the...

164
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,459
That was me holding a burp back.

165
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,519
After considering the situation, move the red object on the screen.

166
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,519
Sometimes there may be nothing to move.

167
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,160
Just do what you consider the appropriate action.

168
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,600
If you wish to stop playing, just push the escape key.

169
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,720
It's too bright.

170
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,040
I don't...

171
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,519
What am I...

172
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,659
I can't fix that.

173
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,100
All right, number one.

174
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,570
The first thing to consider.

175
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,740
Together.

176
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,299
Oh, okay.

177
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:55,450
I wasn't going to move for those people.

178
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,330
Elementary dominoes.

179
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,690
Let's set a world record.

180
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,929
Okay.

181
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:08,149
I feel like I'm doing like a psychology test.

182
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,700
Down, boy.

183
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,340
I did it.

184
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,519
The wobble filter hurts my head.

185
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,960
Yeah, how do I turn that off?

186
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,759
In Tokyo.

187
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,299
Oh, someone's behind us.

188
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,100
Yeah, you're going to move out of the way.

189
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,059
Somebody, you don't want to...

190
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:27,779
If you're going to stand there.

191
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,779
If somebody wants to walk up the escalator, you got to let them pass.

192
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,029
Okay, I'm going to go here.

193
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:41,580
Is it going to reveal you?

194
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,909
You're moderately considerate.

195
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,190
I did everything that anyone should do in those situations.

196
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,850
I'm incredibly considerate.

197
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,539
Wait, this is going to keep going.

198
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:00,409
Does this get harder?

199
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:00,909
Santa.

200
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,200
Oh, I had to put my head down.

201
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:08,279
Okay.

202
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,559
What?

203
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,600
Can I take your order?

204
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,500
I know this fucking wobble filter is freaking me out.

205
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,139
Cocktails.

206
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:20,860
I would want a...

207
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,690
Okay.

208
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,470
I'm going to rate these on a scale of one to ten.

209
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:28,509
Eight.

210
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,820
Okay, no, I don't want a white Russian.

211
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,419
Did I pick a white Russian?

212
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,450
What am I supposed to do?

213
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,710
I just pressed a button.

214
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,509
What button did I press?

215
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:45,690
A, B, C?

216
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,809
What happened?

217
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:58,340
A, B, A, B, B.

218
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,429
Am I not saying words?

219
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:01,909
How do I...

220
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:03,269
I visit space bar?

221
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:08,230
If I get this last pin, you'll go out with me.

222
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,870
Yeah, okay.

223
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,139
Wait, what?

224
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,220
That thing's on a fucking string.

225
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,940
That thing was pulled in some way or another considerate.

226
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,139
I didn't even do anything.

227
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,419
You didn't get on a date.

228
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:37,700
Well, I was supposed to knock the inconsiderate Andy.

229
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,100
I didn't do...

230
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,820
What did I do wrong?

231
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,789
How many levels are there?

232
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:43,909
Okay, cans and bottles.

233
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:46,250
I have to break these?

234
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,649
Oh, I can jump.

235
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:53,929
Is this considerate?

236
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:55,450
I'm destroying recycling, right?

237
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,730
Am I breaking it down?

238
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,250
I'm confused.

239
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,649
I am too.

240
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,139
Stand.

241
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,720
Oh, seat.

242
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
Okay, I did all three of them.

243
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,070
Is this a puzzle?

244
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,269
Let's go to the zoo.

245
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:21,029
Okay, me and girlfriend.

246
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:21,990
Sensor, the lines are...

247
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,690
Wait, oh, I probably...

248
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,419
I mean, you would do the same thing though, right?

249
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,419
There's no way anybody could tell me.

250
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:31,539
Hold on.

251
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:32,419
We got to talk about this.

252
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:32,820
Tap, tap.

253
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,379
There's a ghost.

254
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,059
If there are two lions having sex at the zoo,

255
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,149
what, are you going to leave?

256
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,029
Every single person is going to be like,

257
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:45,750
what the fuck?

258
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,149
Oh, wow.

259
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,990
What's going on?

260
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,620
You're going to like turn away and leave.

261
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,419
All right, I did the wave with everybody.

262
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:03,220
Moderately considerate.

263
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,009
Okay, there are like three buttons.

264
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,610
There's up, down, left, right, and space.

265
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,049
From what I'm understanding here.

266
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:12,470
You went right up to it.

267
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,309
So I guess it would be inconsiderate.

268
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:23,019
Oh, well.

269
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:23,500
Wait, what?

270
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,299
No, I was trying to walk with the character.

271
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,259
Was that considerate?

272
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:31,129
Why would putting your umbrella down

273
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,570
be considerate in the rain?

274
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,009
That's you getting rained on.

275
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,940
Oh man, I got to get off at the next stop.

276
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,899
Doki, doki.

277
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,080
Oh, great.

278
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,279
This is the final stop.

279
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,559
Carano Bus Terminal.

280
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,129
All right, so get off.

281
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,700
I got off.

282
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,730
What's boyfriend and girlfriend here?

283
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,299
Okay, I'm going to sit down.

284
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,299
What?

285
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:05,940
What?

286
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,899
There was enough room.

287
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:09,860
Today is our date.

288
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,059
Okay, Robocon or RomCon.

289
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,580
Let's go to Robocon.

290
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:21,450
I think we both would enjoy that.

291
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:28,440
It's still our date.

292
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay.

293
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,440
What am I supposed to do?

294
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,240
Oh, walk on this side.

295
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,799
So nobody splashes her?

296
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,610
I don't know.

297
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:45,100
And somewhere or another considerate.

298
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,340
What?

299
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,549
Did I not raise my hand to say I need to get off?

300
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:52,070
Robocon is...

301
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,269
Wait, what does that mean?

302
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,070
Does that mean something?

303
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,279
You have to do it based on Japanese culture?

304
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,799
Good morning.

305
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,919
Oh, shit, his head.

306
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,710
No, no, pick it up.

307
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,389
No, don't look.

308
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,029
Don't look.

309
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:09,350
You don't...

310
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:16,580
Japanese samurai is weaker than great elderly.

311
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:22,919
Okay.

312
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,159
Um...

313
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,759
They have no options to do anything.

314
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,679
Oh, I got to walk with her.

315
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,039
Don't walk too fast.

316
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:40,940
Why would I walk in front of her?

317
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,019
Today is another date.

318
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,700
I guess we could think of them as a couple now.

319
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,340
Okay.

320
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,039
They were heading towards an anime

321
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,960
when suddenly they turned towards a romance movie.

322
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,639
He seems really naive.

323
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,159
He builds up his courage and takes her hand.

324
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,600
It seems like they are really dating now.

325
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:13,190
Oh, what you don't know is when you looked over,

326
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,389
he was sleeping.

327
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:17,659
No, keep walking.

328
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:18,379
You don't just walk.

329
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:18,940
Just go by.

330
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,340
You don't have to sit there and stare at anybody.

331
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,940
In some way or another, consider it.

332
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,820
Yeah, but I don't even know...

333
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,259
I couldn't...

334
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,139
I pressed every button.

335
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,899
I couldn't like swing the sword at that guy.

336
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:38,519
You'll stare at the zoo animal.

337
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,240
Okay.

338
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,799
I want...

339
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,360
I want to take...

340
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,240
Hold on.

341
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,039
So you have...

342
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,120
So who have we got for the yellow ranger?

343
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,039
What's...

344
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,330
I don't get it.

345
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,049
Me?

346
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,470
Did I not have raised my hand?

347
00:16:52,470 --> 00:17:00,379
Did I do it?

348
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:01,100
I got it.

349
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,059
What's the max grade?

350
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:05,539
I don't know.

351
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,359
Is that the guy from South Park?

352
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:17,400
Why is that the South Park Warcraft guy?

353
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Okay.

354
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,730
Why is he so sweaty?

355
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,849
Hey, I got my personality test back.

356
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,410
You want to see?

357
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,289
Let's see what you got.

358
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,279
My personality is looking at animals?

359
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:38,599
How do I exit?

360
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,960
Wait, is that what's on my mind?

361
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,160
That's weird.

362
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:49,700
Turn right.

363
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,259
Okay.

364
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:52,259
I feel like that's not a good thing.

365
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:54,710
In some way or another.

366
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,529
There's probably like four letters or four grades.

367
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:04,410
This is me.

368
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,710
Barber or bar?

369
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,430
I don't have any hair.

370
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:09,980
Why would I go...

371
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:11,579
I don't have hair.

372
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:19,190
I missed.

373
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,309
I didn't know that's what I was supposed to do.

374
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,130
You know what really is really fucking inconsiderate?

375
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,890
Sliding a drink down a wet slippery bar

376
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,690
and expecting your friends to catch it.

377
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,809
So that was on him, not me.

378
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,650
That was inconsiderate on them.

379
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,130
Oh, fuck.

380
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,769
I struck out.

381
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,799
Wait, why is it...

382
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,279
Oh, wait.

383
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,799
I'm supposed to let him do that.

384
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,529
Down to my last ball.

385
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,369
This is my last chance.

386
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:03,819
Was I supposed to not block that?

387
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:05,740
Oh, he's catching me.

388
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,420
He's catching the monster.

389
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,759
In some way or another.

390
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,269
That means bad.

391
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:23,299
There's a lot...

392
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,099
Okay, 36.

393
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,220
We're just still going.

394
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,309
I didn't know what button jump was.

395
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,670
I pressed up and it wasn't that.

396
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:37,140
What do I do?

397
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,180
I don't know what that is.

398
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,019
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

399
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:47,660
Why am I scheming?

400
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,119
He missed.

401
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,630
How do I move in those scenarios?

402
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,569
Is there another button I'm not pressing?

403
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,660
Okay, this guy...

404
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,460
Let him sleep on me.

405
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,650
But is it in...

406
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,369
Okay.

407
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:15,619
When I say you, clap your hands.

408
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:18,460
Did I get it?

409
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,500
And somewhere...

410
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,539
I think I'm missing a button.

411
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,380
I have up, down, left, right on the arrow keys.

412
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,099
And I have space.

413
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:31,380
And sometimes I can't move anybody.

414
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:51,000
Wait, am I supposed to be moving them?

415
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:01,130
I can't believe I'm actually going to meet AA in person.

416
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,250
I know I get it.

417
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,849
Okay, BB is nobody there.

418
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:04,970
But like I wanted to come...

419
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,509
I came here to see AA.

420
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:15,769
Oh, I don't have very much time.

421
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,369
Oh, you get that mushroom so you can get bigger.

422
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,440
Well, I didn't want you to...

423
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,180
Okay, we're good.

424
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,220
I got two lives now.

425
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,509
What if it was a poison mushroom?

426
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:34,859
No, take the picture.

427
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,019
I tried to press space.

428
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,059
It didn't do anything.

429
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:40,549
Some of these don't work.

430
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,910
Is it just me or is it cold in here?

431
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,549
Got it.

432
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:46,119
Temperature.

433
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:54,539
We'll turn the heat up a little.

434
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:59,579
And somewhere in there, consider it.

435
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,039
A little?

436
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:02,920
What do you mean?

437
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,640
30 Celsius, Jesus Christ, is what?

438
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,299
Is it 100 degrees?

439
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,660
Shit.

440
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,220
I have so much trouble with Celsius because like

441
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,619
one or two degrees is something completely different.

442
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:27,849
Am I trying to block this guy from reading?

443
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:28,809
Oh, okay.

444
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:33,400
If I lose, that's considerate.

445
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,200
Hey, I'm thirsty.

446
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:35,720
Okay, got it.

447
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,759
She's like burning up.

448
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,279
All right, give me a coffee.

449
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,079
All right, coffee.

450
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,599
I'll take one.

451
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,410
But that's a hot coffee.

452
00:22:48,410 --> 00:23:00,569
Oh, I was trying to...

453
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,970
All right, first of all, I'll be honest.

454
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,170
I was trying to drop it on the floor.

455
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,220
I'll be honest.

456
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,230
TV special, witness the power.

457
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:16,920
Oh, that would be inconsiderate.

458
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,279
I'm just seeing what my options are.

459
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:21,460
I'm just trying to see what it's even possible.

460
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,960
Psycho, psycho, psycho.

461
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,559
No, okay, I'm sorry.

462
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:30,200
I have to really...

463
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm going to have to defend myself on this here.

464
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,039
What am I doing?

465
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,670
Be looking at somebody?

466
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,710
What should we be looking at?

467
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,269
Straight ahead?

468
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,660
You need to know what your tools are capable of doing, okay?

469
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,759
Oh, look, we need a spot.

470
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,829
No, I was trying at first to get a spot.

471
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:54,950
Not me take a spot.

472
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,470
Speed.

473
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:10,119
I thought it was us walking.

474
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,240
Big bro, I'm so hungry.

475
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Big bro has to do something.

476
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,289
Ghost leg competition final.

477
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:16,809
The winner gets all you can eat.

478
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,420
Bra or don't draw.

479
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,140
It's up to you.

480
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,859
The last line.

481
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,339
You, big bro, winner.

482
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:22,839
What?

483
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:28,220
How do I draw?

484
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:30,500
How do I do this?

485
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,380
Control?

486
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,700
Alt?

487
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:34,220
Enter?

488
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,980
Hold the mouse button down?

489
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,819
I can't draw anything.

490
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,750
You need to put a controller in?

491
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:50,470
I didn't have any controls.

492
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:57,029
I don't think you can even look at the control.

493
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,960
Keyboard and mouse?

494
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:09,859
Hey, why don't we check that personality test again?

495
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:10,900
Quick, hit escape.

496
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,289
Hit escape quick.

497
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:14,809
Why am I trying to hit escape?

498
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:20,069
What, did I have like a porn hub tab open?

499
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,109
I don't understand.

500
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:22,309
Why was I freaking out?

501
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:23,670
Are you even listening?

502
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,390
Yes, I am.

503
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,420
Do you think I've get-

504
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,920
No!

505
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,779
That's what I-

506
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:32,339
What?

507
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,140
Are you listening?

508
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,779
I'm listening.

509
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:34,339
I'm listening.

510
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:34,579
I am.

511
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:35,539
I swear to God.

512
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,859
It'd be so much better to be on the other side.

513
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:38,660
I'm listening.

514
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,539
How do I stand the character up?

515
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:47,259
Turn the volume down.

516
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:58,920
Today is premium Friday.

517
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,900
Premium Friday.

518
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,779
Leave at 15.

519
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:08,859
Okay.

520
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,240
Leave.

521
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:11,900
Everybody leave.

522
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,180
Everybody fucking leave.

523
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,660
Leave.

524
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,380
You don't have to work anymore.

525
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,880
Leave.

526
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,059
Leave.

527
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:16,700
All of you leave.

528
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,579
It's time to go home.

529
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:18,779
How do I say go home?

530
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,460
You were here for like four extra hours.

531
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,549
Today is our date.

532
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,269
Why does she have-

533
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:26,869
Wait a second.

534
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,660
Am I dating a cow?

535
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:38,309
What was that?

536
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:44,890
Wait, that's beef?

537
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,559
I didn't-

538
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,599
I thought the sushi-

539
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,160
Okay.

540
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,480
Let me-

541
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,279
Hear me out.

542
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,200
I thought sushi was meat.

543
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,720
And I didn't know what the other thing was.

544
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:07,160
I was unconcerned.

545
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm taking too much.

546
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,069
I get thrown out of the restaurant at this point.

547
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,730
You thought sushi was meat?

548
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,970
Sushi is meat.

549
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,140
I-

550
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,180
You just did it!

551
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,539
You can't change the rules.

552
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:28,700
What do you mean sushi is not meat?

553
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,019
What do you think it is?

554
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:33,099
Waiting for your bento to heat up.

555
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,220
Um, okay.

556
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,940
How much does it cost?

557
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:36,740
All right.

558
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,339
So you can go ahead of me because I'm waiting for my-

559
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:39,140
You can just go ahead of me.

560
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:40,630
Yeah.

561
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,109
That's what I do.

562
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:41,910
If I was like I could look,

563
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,829
I'm gonna be like probably another two minutes or so.

564
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,710
Yeah, that's considerate.

565
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,420
No buttons do anything.

566
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,779
Let me hear you make some noise.

567
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,740
Oh, okay.

568
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,500
I think I've given certain love and peace.

569
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:06,890
Yes, we cannot.

570
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,049
Cannot what?

571
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,690
I don't know what I'm agreeing to as a collective audience.

572
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,299
Today is our date.

573
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,259
Okay, this is a robot.

574
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:22,019
All right, we're gonna go to Robocon.

575
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:29,930
Is that what I should have done?

576
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,170
Mod-

577
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,529
Okay, that was better than last time.

578
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:32,569
Moderately considerate.

579
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,059
Gundam.

580
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:49,930
There we go.

581
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:57,289
Okay.

582
00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:57,930
Moderately-

583
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,569
First in line.

584
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,569
Okay, please ride the robots in order.

585
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:02,950
I don't know-

586
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,269
What?

587
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:07,750
Oh, that one's broken.

588
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:12,980
Help!

589
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:15,990
Help!

590
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,470
Okay, help.

591
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:17,750
Ally.

592
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:39,180
Shut up.

593
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,740
Let him get it.

594
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,369
Yeah, like, look, I'm not gonna get in the middle of two, like, cowboys, okay?

595
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,059
Those are two Red Dead Redemption characters.

596
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,420
I'm gonna grab the drink in the middle.

597
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,220
That's not considerate.

598
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,380
That's called survival.

599
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,019
I'm just-

600
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:01,339
I'm not getting involved with that one.

601
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,059
You can do it.

602
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:11,849
Oh, close that.

603
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,210
Why is there no food in our pot?

604
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:13,930
We need to be patient.

605
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,730
Something will arrive.

606
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,539
Okay, how the fuck are you supposed to do?

607
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:22,259
I didn't want to eat that.

608
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,140
How are you supposed to do that?

609
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:36,299
I think-

610
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,660
Okay, I got what they were looking for.

611
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,470
This is not even considerate.

612
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,750
It's just remembering the routine.

613
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,849
I've got a date tomorrow.

614
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,769
Tomorrow's exam could affect my whole life.

615
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:48,970
Tomorrow's the big day.

616
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,329
Live at the Bucadab-

617
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:51,130
Buc-

618
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:51,930
Typhoon.

619
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,170
What?

620
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,829
Why would I-

621
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:58,380
Why would I have let that go?

622
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,839
It's always been my dream to be saved by a handsome prince riding on a horse.

623
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:06,839
Evil ca-

624
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,559
Wait.

625
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,200
Evil ca-

626
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,480
What should I do?

627
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,000
Go to the race-

628
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,799
The race course?

629
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,700
No, wrong.

630
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,579
So I was going to just go into the evil castle.

631
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:33,559
Shouldn't I just go hang out and meet somebody at the horse track thing?

632
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,650
I'm going to go walk up to Bowser's castle, knock on the door, and be like,

633
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,009
I'm going to wait for Mario.

634
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:41,589
Why would I do that?

635
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:49,319
Well, I guess in the later games, in Mario games.

636
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,019
Isn't Bowser not even a factor anymore?

637
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,579
Is he still doing that?

638
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:06,039
Is Bowser still like-

639
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,049
No.

640
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,009
Pay attention.

641
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,970
Costume competition.

642
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,869
I won.

643
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,869
He's in the new game, Mario Odyssey.

644
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:17,190
Is he?

645
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,339
Okay.

646
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:24,460
Don't push me.

647
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,900
Stunt on a comedy show.

648
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,259
What the fuck is this?

649
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,700
Don't push me.

650
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,740
I'm not going to push you.

651
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:33,450
Okay.

652
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:33,930
I'm not-

653
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,849
What the fuck is going on?

654
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,140
Not even hot.

655
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:40,549
I have to like-

656
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,549
Oh, it's crazy.

657
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,789
It's-

658
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:43,829
I'm real hot here.

659
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:52,410
Eye witness.

660
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,019
Oh, okay.

661
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:56,180
Is it-

662
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,660
We're going to blur-

663
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,619
We have to blur her.

664
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,619
Don't try-

665
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:03,900
In some way or another, consider it.

666
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,539
Push him.

667
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:06,660
It's comedy.

668
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,619
Oh yeah.

669
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,740
Somebody's literally begging me not to push them in something.

670
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,529
Yeah, but comedy show.

671
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:15,289
What is that supposed to mean?

672
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:20,099
And for the celebrity first pitch, Miss BB.

673
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:30,279
That looked bad.

674
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:33,930
I'll be honest, I was trying to hit it out of the park.

675
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,849
I was trying to embarrass BB.

676
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:41,880
Here we go.

677
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,400
I got it.

678
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,319
Remember, you'd be bad at improv.

679
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,829
He's telling me not to.

680
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,829
No, this is how considerate are you?

681
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,190
And dumping somebody into like a burning hot cauldron is not-

682
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,150
I didn't know what the hell I was-

683
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:57,509
What are you talking about?

684
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,609
We have to be safe.

685
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,769
No, no, no.

686
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:02,170
Put it back down.

687
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,130
Put it back down.

688
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,079
It's a comedy bit.

689
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,599
I didn't know I was on a comedy show

690
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:18,119
until five seconds into that.

691
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,570
Uh, did I do it too early?

692
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,980
It said comedy show on the bottom.

693
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,099
Textbook.

694
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,889
Should I not look?

695
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:33,429
I think that's like where my eyes are looking.

696
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,320
So I'm gonna like look over here.

697
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,369
Right?

698
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:44,579
No, you look at the book.

699
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,099
Yeah, all right.

700
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,179
I'm like looking over at like a poster.

701
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,460
Oh, seatbelt.

702
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:09,610
Why are people calling you psycho?

703
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,409
I don't know.

704
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,420
Anyone know the answer?

705
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,599
You do.

706
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:41,380
Oh, but look, there's a spaceship over there.

707
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:52,099
Don't be distracted.

708
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,170
Me and then a couple.

709
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,889
Oh, I like sacrifice myself to get abducted.

710
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:09,639
Or yes, hand up.

711
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:14,519
Or no, hand down.

712
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:18,340
Answer if don't want world destroyed.

713
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,980
What?

714
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,659
Answer if don't you is human?

715
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,940
Yes.

716
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,619
Answer if don't want world destroyed.

717
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:24,500
Yes or no?

718
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,280
Don't want the earth destroyed.

719
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,880
No, I don't want the earth destroyed.

720
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,000
But don't want the earth-

721
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,960
I don't no-

722
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,280
Don't not want the earth not destroyed.

723
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,550
Put the hand down.

724
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,269
Tomorrow of today's day before yesterday's three days ago.

725
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,489
I can't even put my hand back down.

726
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,449
You lose weight?

727
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,329
Yes, apparently.

728
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,670
You see here?

729
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,610
I can't put my hand down.

730
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,650
You secret keep?

731
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:55,820
You have itchy spots?

732
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,500
Yes, I don't know.

733
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,380
I can't put my hand down.

734
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:01,780
You hero, you save world?

735
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,630
Yes, I can't put my hand down.

736
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:21,880
Was it escape?

737
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,360
Telephone.

738
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,079
Help, save me.

739
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,579
What's happening?

740
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,059
Save me?

741
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:36,630
Oh, I had to look away because he was changing to turn into a superhero.

742
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,269
I get it.

743
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,230
Okay, so we're just talking.

744
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:41,510
Somebody wants to-

745
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,389
All right, somebody wants to get up.

746
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,829
Let them go.

747
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:53,539
Discussion, future of the band, break up or vocal solo debut?

748
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,400
Oh, shit.

749
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Okay, that was just me walking by it.

750
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:10,860
Okay, consider it.

751
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,619
All right, we got an important announcement for all of you.

752
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,769
My grandma suddenly passed away.

753
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,210
Oh, that's not-

754
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,769
I don't-

755
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:22,250
I'm not gonna-

756
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,050
We're gonna break up after today.

757
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,090
Okay, we don't cheer.

758
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:31,670
And what else you got?

759
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,230
Oh, okay.

760
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:39,639
Well, I was waiting for the other one.

761
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,119
Oh, fuck.

762
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:40,599
I'm sorry.

763
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,539
What's considerate here?

764
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:45,420
I don't know.

765
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,809
How do I get you to get up?

766
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:51,670
That wasn't considerate.

767
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,369
Very vaguely considerate.

768
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:04,150
Top right corner.

769
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,909
Could I have clicked it with the mouse?

770
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:06,469
I couldn't move.

771
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,429
I couldn't walk around.

772
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:12,679
You're a horrible person.

773
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:15,769
And today, I'm definitely gonna get-

774
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:16,010
What?

775
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:29,210
I don't know what that said, but I would sit here if I had a choice.

776
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,010
I'm bored.

777
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,769
I guess I should go attack a planet or something.

778
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,050
Hero is away.

779
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:33,769
Hero is in.

780
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,119
Well, it'd be considerate to, like, if the hero's there,

781
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,800
that I would lose, but I could get, like, my fill of attacking a planet,

782
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,159
but I would lose and I could just do it again.

783
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:43,639
I would leave.

784
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,840
I wouldn't actually destroy it, right?

785
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,050
Yeah, you got me.

786
00:39:49,050 --> 00:40:00,070
Jesus.

787
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:07,690
It's been a while, but you came.

788
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,530
I really wanted to see you.

789
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,780
Just hold my hand.

790
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,789
Brings back memories, huh?

791
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:28,619
You sent me photo of that ghost.

792
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:33,050
I said it as my background, you know.

793
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:37,849
It was fun going to see that band.

794
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:43,159
We even went on a date with that cow, right?

795
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,199
Now I'd be like, okay, what are you talking about?

796
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,320
I know all about it.

797
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,809
It would have been nice to stay with you longer.

798
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:54,570
This is fucking horrible.

799
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,159
Remember the giant monster?

800
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:03,989
I totally beat it.

801
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,230
Do you remember the first day we met?

802
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:13,050
You were so indecisive.

803
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,730
Anyway, forget about me.

804
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:19,349
Just go find someone new.

805
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,769
What the fuck?

806
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:23,769
Sorry, can't stop crying.

807
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:25,719
Is this a bad ending?

808
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,469
I'm sorry I couldn't be more considerate.

809
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:32,539
But I'm not strong enough.

810
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:34,219
Wait, this is me.

811
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:36,139
I'm on my deathbed.

812
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,900
You always look out for other people.

813
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,659
You're so kind.

814
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:43,260
I really loved that about you.

815
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,170
I think it's me.

816
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,929
Even the times you didn't need to.

817
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:52,780
Oops.

818
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,179
Thank you.

819
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,099
Bye.

820
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:01,780
I don't want to die.

821
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,769
What the fuck?

822
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:04,570
This is got...

823
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,369
We went from like taking seats on the subway

824
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:09,449
to like somebody dying in your arms.

825
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:13,539
That's quite the bad ending.

826
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:31,460
That's still going, okay?

827
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,059
Very vaguely considerate.

828
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,019
Oh, should you get out of the way

829
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:39,860
for people walking up the escalator?

830
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,699
This person's fucking dead.

831
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:46,199
And it's your fault.

832
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:52,250
Oh.

833
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,289
Ooh, okay.

834
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,090
Your sympathy is your best quality.

835
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,610
Eco tote bag level.

836
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:03,210
All right, so my sympathy...

837
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,469
Ability to fit in, sense of duty,

838
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:12,230
quick thinking, application, and determination.

839
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,909
Eco tote bag level.

840
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:17,210
That's really fucking funny.

841
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:17,530
Okay.

842
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,300
Inconsiderate mode.

843
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,380
Considerate extras, chapters, secrets.

844
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,449
Okay, that was cool.

845
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,929
Should we just go right on to the next one?

846
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:31,210
There's three of these.

847
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:37,099
There's literally one, two, and three.

848
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:38,059
Should we just do number two?

849
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,079
Do inconsiderate mode.

850
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:41,800
All right.

851
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,260
What does this mean?

852
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,800
No one's going to hold you back.

853
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,239
Go ahead and mess around to your heart's content.

854
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:47,880
Okay.

855
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,730
Please be inconsiderate and mess around.

856
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,530
There's no explanations.

857
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,489
Just go nuts.

858
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:54,409
Or you can escape if you don't want to play anymore.

859
00:43:54,409 --> 00:43:58,150
All right.

860
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,469
Oh, okay.

861
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,190
That's very...

862
00:43:59,190 --> 00:43:59,909
I get it.

863
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:01,820
I get it.

864
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,610
You're just doing the opposite.

865
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,170
I get it.

866
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,210
Nah, I wouldn't need to do this.

867
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:05,610
Let's do that.

868
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:09,480
Let's do the next one.

869
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:09,960
Yeah.

870
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,519
Let's do...

871
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:13,579
Let's just go right on to the second one.

872
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:15,019
We could probably just bang them all out in a row.

873
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:20,340
Put the next one on.

874
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:20,579
Here.

875
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:25,739
You can get the cam for like 15 seconds while I do this.

876
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,170
Exit application.

877
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,349
You can see my pores.

878
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:36,150
Whatever.

879
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,949
We all have them.

880
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:41,079
All right.

881
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,599
Let's play inconsiderate two.

882
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:47,500
This one's called considerate more.

883
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,699
Considerate more.

884
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:51,849
A new era.

885
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:53,050
It's not too loud.

886
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:53,690
Brace yourself.

887
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,170
It might be...

888
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,610
Let's mute it.

889
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,639
I think we're good.

890
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,159
Does that count?

891
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:04,579
Okay.

892
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:07,000
Let's do it.

893
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,440
Hey, there it is.

894
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,599
Yeah.

895
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:15,719
I'll check the controls on this one.

896
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:18,039
Should I even change the game title?

897
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,250
I mean, do I even really need to change the game title?

898
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,130
It's the same fucking game.

899
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:25,289
All right.

900
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:27,369
Press any button.

901
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:32,710
All right.

902
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,190
Options.

903
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:36,820
Video.

904
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,420
Let's make sure it's in the right resolution.

905
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,219
Yeah.

906
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:40,179
1920 by 1080.

907
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:40,659
Full screen.

908
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:41,300
That's all I can do.

909
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,159
All right.

910
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:43,800
How to play.

911
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,829
This is a space where you are free to consider things as you like.

912
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,550
There's no one here to stop you from being as considered as you please.

913
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,440
After considering the situation, move the red object on the screen.

914
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:58,699
Okay.

915
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,500
But how do I move on the screen?

916
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,739
I think it's just the arrow keys in space.

917
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,179
It didn't tell you anything.

918
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,320
All right.

919
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:11,800
Consider it.

920
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,059
Use a controller.

921
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:16,260
It's just arrows in space.

922
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:16,579
Okay.

923
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:19,579
All right.

924
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:20,059
Part two.

925
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,139
Keep the face cam on.

926
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:25,300
I'll do the face cam for consider it's free.

927
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,780
That's what I'm going to have to keep really in with the third sequel.

928
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,179
You know what I mean?

929
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:38,579
Number one.

930
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:39,780
The announcement of a new era.

931
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,900
And the new name, the new era will be called Rewa.

932
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:46,070
Bro.

933
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,030
I held it up the wrong way.

934
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:56,900
There we go.

935
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,219
Okay.

936
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,820
Should I move?

937
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,539
Oh, this is for a ride.

938
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:05,179
What am I doing?

939
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,239
Okay.

940
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,119
You guys can go first because you're together, right?

941
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:15,510
Because then you'll take up two cars.

942
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:16,070
Line drive.

943
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:20,469
Oh, let the kid get it.

944
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,150
That's not how I would do this, by the way.

945
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,670
I would be up there trying to catch it with the sole reason that

946
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,500
two of us trying to catch it for that kid is...

947
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:33,380
All right.

948
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:33,860
Walk.

949
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,260
Holy shit.

950
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,739
Don't walk.

951
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:42,070
Two of us trying to catch it for that kid is exponentially more statistics for that to happen.

952
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:42,710
All right.

953
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,670
This is a comedy show.

954
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,659
I'll do it.

955
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:46,699
I won't do it.

956
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:50,039
Because everybody laughs, right?

957
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,989
The previous five questions.

958
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:57,219
Very vaguely considerate.

959
00:47:57,219 --> 00:47:57,860
Oh.

960
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:05,800
You catch it and you hand the ball to the kid

961
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,119
to have the chance the kid actually gets the ball higher.

962
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:09,960
Let's eat ramen.

963
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:12,309
Recommended.

964
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:12,949
Your salt.

965
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:15,210
Salt ramen.

966
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:18,920
I'll take this one here.

967
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:22,260
How is that inconsistent?

968
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,619
It's what I wanted to order at a restaurant.

969
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,559
Thanks for the meal.

970
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,250
Who's waiting for a seat, please?

971
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,369
Oh, people are waiting.

972
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,050
No, don't fucking get up.

973
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:33,550
Get up.

974
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,719
Okay.

975
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,920
Here we go.

976
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,960
Oh, they're trying to take a picture.

977
00:48:48,599 --> 00:49:02,389
See, I really tried to photobomb that, but I got it wrong.

978
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:06,940
Tablet.

979
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,179
Here.

980
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:08,840
You always give two.

981
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:12,969
Always.

982
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:15,530
Because some people, they want more than one.

983
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,320
But they'll never ask for more than one.

984
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,920
You were part-time for a...

985
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,239
What the...

986
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:20,039
I didn't even read it.

987
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,380
Books.

988
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:22,940
I don't know.

989
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,340
I didn't even...

990
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:30,179
I could have the chance to read the thing.

991
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:30,900
Considerably...

992
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,139
All right.

993
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:31,460
That's...

994
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,980
I was pretty considerate.

995
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,530
Three words per minute reading Andy.

996
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:40,409
No, it's called like...

997
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,570
50 words a minute reading Andy.

998
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:46,329
But it's split evenly across two different screens reading your comments.

999
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:47,820
I'll let you have one bite.

1000
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,030
Oh, one bite.

1001
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,429
Right there.

1002
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:52,469
Okay, that's pretty good.

1003
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:53,670
Never eat the top.

1004
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,150
Always just one little bite at the bottom.

1005
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,710
And you leave the frosting and shit forever for them to enjoy.

1006
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:02,739
50 words per minute is still awful.

1007
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,650
Starting school today.

1008
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,849
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.

1009
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:06,349
Okay.

1010
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,900
Emperor.

1011
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,639
Yep.

1012
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:11,960
Here.

1013
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,440
Oh, no.

1014
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,079
I'm God.

1015
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:19,449
That kid...

1016
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:19,949
Wow.

1017
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:23,949
Censored.

1018
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:27,000
Quick, change the channel.

1019
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,760
Get away from the lion sex.

1020
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,699
There's only two channels on TV.

1021
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,619
They're broadcasting this across every network.

1022
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:37,820
I think that's very actually important to find out why.

1023
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,460
Like, CBS, ABC, NBC.

1024
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,340
They're all airing it.

1025
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:41,840
Why?

1026
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,320
Okay.

1027
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,739
Yellow Fighter.

1028
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,659
Oh, you got me.

1029
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:53,039
Did I lose?

1030
00:50:53,739 --> 00:51:01,289
This isn't my stop.

1031
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:15,539
Here we go.

1032
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,900
That's the thing to do, but here's the thing.

1033
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,420
That also seems kind of rude, doesn't it?

1034
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,059
I don't know.

1035
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:20,699
Part of me is like...

1036
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,940
Everybody gets up and like...

1037
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,440
What?

1038
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,800
Something wrong with me?

1039
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,469
You're just gonna get the fuck away from me as fast as possible?

1040
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:30,030
Like, oh, wow.

1041
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,510
You really hate sitting next to me so badly that

1042
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,550
the second the seat came available, you ran the fuck away as soon as you could.

1043
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,690
I know that's completely irrational, but I feel like somewhere in my brain I think that.

1044
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:43,710
So moving one seat over...

1045
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,110
Oh, shit.

1046
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:44,670
That's right.

1047
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,469
I did it wrong.

1048
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:49,769
But one seat over is like...

1049
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,170
You're barely offensive enough to me where one seat is fine.

1050
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,750
Okay, so what are we doing?

1051
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,389
Oh, we're gonna walk...

1052
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:57,710
Oh, wait.

1053
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,429
I have to go like this.

1054
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,179
I wanna play this game.

1055
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,579
That is cool.

1056
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,239
One seat over is giving them space.

1057
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:17,079
Five seats is you smell.

1058
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:18,760
Yeah, that's fucked up.

1059
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,719
I shouldn't have gone that far.

1060
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,500
Um...

1061
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:25,340
Can you fit?

1062
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,079
They not want that?

1063
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,679
Was I supposed to get out of the elevator?

1064
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:39,519
Two.

1065
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:41,570
Three.

1066
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,920
Four.

1067
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:52,860
My god.

1068
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:54,539
Holy shit.

1069
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:55,579
That would be terrifying.

1070
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:05,519
Psycho.

1071
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:08,889
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1072
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:09,389
Here.

1073
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:11,980
Take my card?

1074
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:13,739
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1075
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:15,099
How do I give you the card?

1076
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,329
Other person, you.

1077
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,449
This pleasure is all mine.

1078
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:19,769
What's...

1079
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:20,409
Why am I look...

1080
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:21,210
Where am I looking?

1081
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,010
It's pulling up.

1082
00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:23,610
It's pulling up.

1083
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,230
Okay.

1084
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:25,469
Where...

1085
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:44,800
I'm gonna stay here.

1086
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,000
Look at her face.

1087
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,960
I couldn't look at her face.

1088
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,239
I could just look at her teeth.

1089
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:59,480
I'm moderately considerate.

1090
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Because it was definitely pulling up, guys.

1091
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,599
Oh, my stomach.

1092
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,239
Sorry.

1093
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:17,880
Last one.

1094
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:19,519
Uh...

1095
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:21,340
Ow, my stomach.

1096
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,960
I'm gonna shit my pants.

1097
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,480
I'm no longer thinking about...

1098
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,280
I just got killed.

1099
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:25,780
Thanks.

1100
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,039
I'm no longer thinking about...

1101
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,239
Where the...

1102
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:30,840
Like, how the stall's situated.

1103
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,440
That shit.

1104
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,199
If I'm gonna, like, shit my pants,

1105
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:34,840
I'm going...

1106
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,400
I gotta get in one.

1107
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,039
I gotta get in one.

1108
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,409
Oh, he's having his password in.

1109
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:44,730
What am I supposed to not look at?

1110
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,690
Just look at the doll?

1111
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,360
Inconsiderate.

1112
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,880
Both of those things could be weird.

1113
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:56,239
Why are you staring at my computer?

1114
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:57,280
Cafe moonbucks.

1115
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:57,760
Outdoor...

1116
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,159
No, no, no.

1117
00:54:58,159 --> 00:54:59,119
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1118
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:00,000
It's hot out.

1119
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,500
Oh, I...

1120
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,369
Oh, God.

1121
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,449
Why does it have a gun?

1122
00:55:09,449 --> 00:55:24,619
Was it...

1123
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:26,460
Maybe it was put my hands up?

1124
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,550
Oh, here we go again.

1125
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:45,320
I'm a ghost.

1126
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,679
Why are you guys question marking me?

1127
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:48,039
Why are you guys saying that's inconsiderate?

1128
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:48,760
Is it really?

1129
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,179
Because they just got a picture of a fucking ghost.

1130
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:54,920
They can sell that for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1131
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,880
I was trying to make them money.

1132
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:15,369
It's considerate to get sucked up as, like, a boba ball?

1133
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:18,289
Okay.

1134
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,409
It was three minutes?

1135
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,099
Big bro, I'm so hungry.

1136
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:23,500
Hang on.

1137
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,619
Big brother will earn some money.

1138
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,280
Closer Trans Am quiz.

1139
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,440
Person who answers correctly first will get the prize.

1140
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,360
Mount Fuji is the tallest mountain in Japan.

1141
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:36,429
I don't know.

1142
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:39,960
Maybe?

1143
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:41,980
Probably?

1144
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:50,679
What does it say?

1145
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:52,039
Oh, I gotta keep the spotlight.

1146
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:59,289
And you, down to the front row.

1147
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,159
Quit throwing popcorn.

1148
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:18,650
That was good.

1149
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:22,360
I know I voice cracked.

1150
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,000
I know.

1151
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:37,960
This is a natural sense.

1152
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,340
It's not something that can be trained.

1153
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,480
Okay.

1154
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,880
Looks like I was right about this one.

1155
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:47,599
Oh, put the glasses up.

1156
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,880
Let's keep it up.

1157
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,679
Keep the glasses up.

1158
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,070
Just hold them on your face at this point.

1159
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:15,869
Should I let them stay down?

1160
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:24,750
Take this, our finishing move.

1161
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:26,699
All right.

1162
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:28,699
At this rate, it'll never end.

1163
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:36,679
I'm dead?

1164
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:46,969
All right, can I leave?

1165
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:48,250
Is it from oil tycoon?

1166
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:52,780
Oh, electric vehicle.

1167
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,719
Let's get in the electric vehicle.

1168
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:02,570
E.

1169
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:06,619
It was from oil tycoon.

1170
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:09,739
Well, look, look at it.

1171
00:59:09,739 --> 00:59:11,719
What do you mean it's an oil tycoon?

1172
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:13,679
I don't know.

1173
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:14,400
Yeah, I don't know.

1174
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:20,960
About to use the hand dryer.

1175
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:23,840
Put your hands.

1176
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,280
No, put your hands underneath this.

1177
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,639
I'm sorry.

1178
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:27,679
I need to get this right.

1179
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,119
Oh, whatever.

1180
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:32,760
Fucking just go.

1181
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:39,800
You never learned how gasoline is made?

1182
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,599
I know.

1183
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:42,039
But EV, I don't know.

1184
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,559
I want to get in the EV car.

1185
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:45,079
I don't care how considerate that is.

1186
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:52,519
I don't even drive an EV car.

1187
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:55,159
But I want to see what the inside looks like.

1188
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,010
Oh, shit.

1189
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,809
Oh, I just fucking killed that person.

1190
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:06,409
Taking the train with your girlfriend.

1191
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:08,110
Okay.

1192
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:09,920
We're going to go over here.

1193
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,940
Right here.

1194
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,269
This looks good.

1195
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:15,760
Want to sit down?

1196
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,639
Yeah.

1197
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:23,800
Your change is 3,201 yen.

1198
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:26,940
Here.

1199
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:31,050
What is the other person doing with their handout?

1200
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:33,500
Is that the wrong customer?

1201
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,389
Line up.

1202
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:44,199
Attention.

1203
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:55,039
Right.

1204
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:55,519
What?

1205
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,000
You just said right.

1206
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,039
I'm the only one that listened.

1207
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:00,800
No, stand up.

1208
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:07,389
You okay?

1209
01:01:07,389 --> 01:01:09,150
Mr. A isn't feeling well.

1210
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:16,480
The tallest mountain in Japan is Mount Fuji.

1211
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,960
That's true.

1212
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,159
I am a doll made of wood.

1213
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:25,389
No, that's not a lie.

1214
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:26,829
My whole body is made of metal.

1215
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:27,469
That's a lie.

1216
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,150
I wanted a group date.

1217
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,190
I invented the light bulb.

1218
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:30,989
This is all lies.

1219
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:31,630
I'm Mario.

1220
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:32,110
That's a lie.

1221
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,960
I was the vote of the sexiest man again this year.

1222
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,840
That's a lie.

1223
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,480
I'm Mickey.

1224
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,599
That's a lie.

1225
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:38,159
Same company.

1226
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:41,099
I was just scouted by a professional soccer team.

1227
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:41,500
That's a lie.

1228
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:44,780
They insured my legs.

1229
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,260
That's a lie.

1230
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:46,699
No, that's true.

1231
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,360
I couldn't go any further.

1232
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,579
I tried to go up higher and it gets stuck.

1233
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:08,139
I could only go.

1234
01:02:08,139 --> 01:02:10,380
I could only move it one direction or the other.

1235
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,539
I tried to move it longer like three or four times.

1236
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:13,019
It didn't work.

1237
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,019
Consider it to let you fight.

1238
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:25,639
Yeah, I tried to make the nose longer.

1239
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:26,039
It didn't work.

1240
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:28,280
The controls in this game are fucking ass.

1241
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,079
I have a date with my boyfriend today.

1242
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:37,309
Prairie.

1243
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:37,710
I don't know.

1244
01:02:38,269 --> 01:02:38,750
What's that mean?

1245
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:58,860
Deers love prairies.

1246
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,579
No smoking.

1247
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:00,460
Put the cigarette down.

1248
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:02,429
Put the cigarette down.

1249
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:03,070
Get out of the way.

1250
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,030
How do I put down the cigarette?

1251
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,699
Smoking's not the inconsiderate part of this.

1252
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:13,260
I mean, it is because there's a post-it sign there.

1253
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:17,099
But walking in the way of the Olympian that's lighting the torch or whatever the fuck's going on

1254
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:19,820
is that's like the ultimate inconsiderate thing.

1255
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:26,190
Okay, here we go.

1256
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:28,440
You ready?

1257
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:31,019
All right.

1258
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:33,610
Boring.

1259
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:37,639
Take it.

1260
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:58,599
That wasn't bad.

1261
01:03:58,599 --> 01:03:59,239
Okay.

1262
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,510
Who do I?

1263
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,469
What do I do?

1264
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:02,670
That person's gonna die.

1265
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:02,909
All right.

1266
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:05,070
So then you get on here and you switch.

1267
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:10,119
Here we go.

1268
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:14,670
Move the cursor.

1269
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:21,800
I'll move the cursor off the screen.

1270
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,159
I'm not going to get that.

1271
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,500
I could probably kick it.

1272
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:25,739
No.

1273
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:36,670
No, I try to put my foot up, but none of the buttons work.

1274
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,840
I'm in charge of the paper ball.

1275
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,440
The closer the timing, the better.

1276
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,159
What?

1277
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:43,130
I've been waiting.

1278
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:46,489
I wanted to put my foot out and stop the can.

1279
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:50,860
Okay.

1280
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,130
All right then.

1281
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:55,260
Again.

1282
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:57,760
Oh!

1283
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,219
I literally tried to put my foot out to stop the cannon.

1284
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:07,980
None of the actions did anything.

1285
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:19,179
That was fine.

1286
01:05:19,179 --> 01:05:23,949
I wish I had a bike.

1287
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,630
Leave it to big bro.

1288
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,400
Road race competition.

1289
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,079
The winner of the race will get a brand new bicycle.

1290
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,119
Okay.

1291
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,000
Who will win the new bicycle?

1292
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,480
This is the final stretch.

1293
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:45,239
Um, I can't.

1294
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:48,300
Wait, should I not be winning?

1295
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:57,210
You're an asshole.

1296
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,409
I'm trying to slow down.

1297
01:05:58,409 --> 01:05:59,690
If I couldn't, I couldn't stop.

1298
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:07,420
He hates it.

1299
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,900
I saw the can in the middle of the road and I was like, do I hit the can?

1300
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,179
So I tried to run the can over.

1301
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:12,780
The can didn't knock my bike over.

1302
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,510
Am I the, who am I?

1303
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:17,869
Am I the groom?

1304
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:33,280
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the bride.

1305
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,099
I should have just, I should have stayed seated.

1306
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:47,469
Okay.

1307
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:48,829
Um, what finger does it go on?

1308
01:06:49,469 --> 01:06:51,150
It goes on this one, right?

1309
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,989
What, one, two, it goes on this finger.

1310
01:06:53,550 --> 01:07:04,349
It doesn't go on the middle finger.

1311
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,190
Okay.

1312
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:06,690
Hooray!

1313
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:12,449
Yay!

1314
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:23,070
Oh, time to catch it.

1315
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:28,809
Oh, I missed it.

1316
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:32,170
So you just pretend like you're going to go for it but you don't actually go for it.

1317
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,050
Because I don't want to be lined up for like another hour taking photos

1318
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,530
with like the photographer, videographer.

1319
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:41,070
You pretend like you really want to catch it and then it's like,

1320
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:42,030
oh no, I missed it.

1321
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:43,230
Oh, congratulations.

1322
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:47,099
I don't want to line up with like, oh, bring it over here in front of the cake.

1323
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:48,380
Let's take five pictures.

1324
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,980
No, just, I don't fucking want to do that.

1325
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:56,219
Okay.

1326
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,210
Uh, don't let go.

1327
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:01,630
You better not let go.

1328
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:10,539
Oh, I'm not letting go.

1329
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:16,810
Look, I know like when the kid's riding the bike and it's like, did you let go?

1330
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:17,609
Don't let go.

1331
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:18,329
Did you let go?

1332
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,489
I fucking didn't even pay attention.

1333
01:08:21,289 --> 01:08:23,279
Oops.

1334
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,640
I denied my boss work.

1335
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:26,239
Oops.

1336
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:29,470
I give her, all right, just give everybody fucking holidays.

1337
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,069
Give everybody a holiday.

1338
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,199
Wait, I just, what did I just do?

1339
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:36,600
I think I denied, I think I just made everybody work.

1340
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,640
Lunch with a girl in a dress.

1341
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,960
I didn't even, it was too fast.

1342
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,760
I don't know where to go.

1343
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,640
It was on the screen for less than a tenth of a second.

1344
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,560
I don't know where it was supposed to go.

1345
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:58,479
The store featured recent releases.

1346
01:08:59,449 --> 01:09:00,090
Texas Hold'em.

1347
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,289
Oh, I want this one.

1348
01:09:01,289 --> 01:09:09,479
What about anything else?

1349
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:27,000
I just woke up on my own.

1350
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:34,779
Um, okay.

1351
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,239
It was, she wasn't really by the game.

1352
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,869
Why are you bad at this?

1353
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:46,590
Explain to me how a guy flying across the screen with his lips puckered

1354
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,199
and I'm lying down.

1355
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,760
How am I supposed to understand what I have to do there?

1356
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,800
What are you talking about?

1357
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:00,090
Yeah, so what?

1358
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:00,890
I have to get kissed?

1359
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:02,090
I didn't even do anything.

1360
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,609
I would have to sit up to get a kiss?

1361
01:10:03,609 --> 01:10:04,170
I don't understand.

1362
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:10,729
Yeah, if you need to get out, go.

1363
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:14,300
I'm not going to like close you in.

1364
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:23,770
Okay, something wrong.

1365
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:25,050
All right, what's wrong?

1366
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:29,579
Oh, okay, I moved.

1367
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:30,460
All right, move out of the way.

1368
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:37,310
Am I controlling the smoke?

1369
01:10:38,029 --> 01:10:43,420
How is a grill sentient?

1370
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,210
How can I be considerate with a grill smoke?

1371
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,810
All right, cold sake.

1372
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,279
Press the button to stop.

1373
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:53,199
The button, okay.

1374
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:57,050
I'm going to, that's what you want.

1375
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:02,430
No use, I'm so sleepy.

1376
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,229
I've got to take a nap.

1377
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,829
No, that's not considerate.

1378
01:11:19,659 --> 01:11:21,500
Your yearly physical exam came in.

1379
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,659
We'll start with a urine test.

1380
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:24,779
Please fill this cup up.

1381
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:38,939
That's right to the brim.

1382
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,439
It's just like a party cup too, by the way.

1383
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:53,560
Not even in a tight, encloseable thing.

1384
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:55,800
Why was it just a big solo cup?

1385
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:59,289
I'll get our tickets to the soccer game.

1386
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:00,890
Only three tickets left.

1387
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:07,949
No, grandma wants to go to the soccer game.

1388
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:08,829
There's three tickets left.

1389
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:11,310
I'm going to go get a, I'm not going to just, no.

1390
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:14,960
I'm sorry, okay?

1391
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,340
The person that looks at this guy gets shot.

1392
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:32,720
So I'm not doing that.

1393
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:38,189
Well, just a fucking chug in his blood.

1394
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:52,409
What's considerate in a pistol duel is, okay, he cheated.

1395
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:54,939
He did that literally.

1396
01:12:54,939 --> 01:12:57,680
Like that was too quick.

1397
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,319
I pressed left.

1398
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,630
That's better.

1399
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:07,369
Is it not better?

1400
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,170
Was it too much?

1401
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,510
No, you idiot.

1402
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:15,470
What are you doing?

1403
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,510
Why would you take it away?

1404
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:17,710
I didn't want to take it away.

1405
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:30,680
Wrong person.

1406
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,520
Taking in the night scenery with your girlfriend.

1407
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,199
This person's having sex in their car.

1408
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,600
Okay, was that a taxi?

1409
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,920
That looked like a taxi.

1410
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,210
The family's calling.

1411
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:50,250
Mom, dad, or girl.

1412
01:13:51,529 --> 01:13:52,649
It's always you go right to mom.

1413
01:13:53,449 --> 01:13:55,869
Every dog that's ever been in my family.

1414
01:13:55,869 --> 01:13:58,510
Every dog, it always goes to mom.

1415
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:59,149
Always.

1416
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:03,079
Make little one inch bigger.

1417
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:07,739
How much bigger?

1418
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:12,029
Is that good?

1419
01:14:12,029 --> 01:14:12,829
More?

1420
01:14:12,829 --> 01:14:16,220
I don't know how big you want me to make little one inch.

1421
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:21,289
If I could make them too big.

1422
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:27,739
Wait, why am I sneaking out?

1423
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:28,619
I didn't read the text.

1424
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:29,739
I was too busy looking at it over here.

1425
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:30,460
Everybody yelling at me.

1426
01:14:47,659 --> 01:14:49,180
Yeah, I like this dance.

1427
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:58,890
Ooh, nice, okay.

1428
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:01,199
I saw the belly move.

1429
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:16,680
Cool.

1430
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,479
All right, I did that one perfectly.

1431
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:33,229
Plainly considerate.

1432
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:42,810
I don't know what the scale here is.

1433
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:43,930
That was a good match.

1434
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:52,239
Let's head home.

1435
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,279
I hope I clean up.

1436
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,880
I wouldn't be, I wouldn't do this at all, by the way.

1437
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,399
I'm not touching somebody else's trash.

1438
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:02,350
I'm going to make sure that my area is perfect.

1439
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,880
So that was, wait, what is going on?

1440
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:11,039
You see when and might as then as well, right?

1441
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:11,279
Yep.

1442
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:12,880
Yep.

1443
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,359
But said that.

1444
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,840
Don't fall asleep.

1445
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,239
Can you believe it?

1446
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:20,880
Ha ha ha ha.

1447
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,840
I know, I can't believe it.

1448
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:27,229
It's crazy.

1449
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:28,510
Let's cross at the crosswalk.

1450
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:32,989
It's not ready yet.

1451
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,579
Do I go?

1452
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:36,140
Where's the light?

1453
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,720
That person was sitting in the middle of the intersection.

1454
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:46,720
I like had to go.

1455
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,560
Making cold Chinese noodles.

1456
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,569
I think I did it.

1457
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:52,890
Did I?

1458
01:16:52,890 --> 01:17:02,399
Bro, look, it's a sea turtle.

1459
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:03,119
Wow, for real.

1460
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,350
She's here to lay her eggs.

1461
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:07,229
Let's watch over them.

1462
01:17:07,229 --> 01:17:07,710
Absolutely.

1463
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:17,720
He wants to become a hero.

1464
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:20,680
What?

1465
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,409
I don't get it.

1466
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:26,199
What was I supposed to do?

1467
01:17:39,869 --> 01:17:41,470
You were part-time for a moving company.

1468
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:44,409
I didn't even get to read this.

1469
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,170
I can't read that fast.

1470
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:48,329
I'm going to put dad's DVDs at somewhere.

1471
01:17:48,890 --> 01:18:03,689
And that's how you solve these formulas.

1472
01:18:03,689 --> 01:18:05,130
This will be on the test.

1473
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,090
Make sure to take notes.

1474
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:16,140
Okay, I had to put sunglasses on?

1475
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,600
Move out of the way.

1476
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,239
Move out of the way.

1477
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:23,960
Get out of the way.

1478
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,359
Dodge.

1479
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:26,090
Dodge.

1480
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:39,770
What the hell's going on?

1481
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:42,350
January, New Year's Day.

1482
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,869
Exorcism rituals.

1483
01:18:43,869 --> 01:18:46,699
Oh, I just got exorcised.

1484
01:18:46,699 --> 01:18:54,409
The evil Mr. Rogue was cast down into hell.

1485
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:58,800
However, since he once saved a spider in the past,

1486
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,680
the Buddha lowered a thread of spider silk down to him.

1487
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,159
Seeing it, he went and started climbing the thread.

1488
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:10,569
But also, others crowded around, seeking to climb up as well.

1489
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:15,800
Everybody stay calm.

1490
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,329
The thread will snap if we all try to climb.

1491
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:20,569
He's so smart, so persuasive.

1492
01:19:22,829 --> 01:19:24,590
Make a line and we'll climb one at a time.

1493
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:30,460
When you reach the top, call down for the next person.

1494
01:19:33,789 --> 01:19:34,430
So smart.

1495
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:37,159
Wait, this is...

1496
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:47,579
Okay, I'm going to snip the line and fucking...

1497
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:50,760
I'm not going to...

1498
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,840
No, I'm not going to cut the thread.

1499
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:00,569
I gave that opportunity, so I'm just going to take it away.

1500
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:03,579
Shake.

1501
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:11,520
Those people were in hell.

1502
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,000
So don't make the offer if you don't plan on going through with it.

1503
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,029
Did I move?

1504
01:20:22,029 --> 01:20:22,590
What am I doing?

1505
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:24,369
Shit.

1506
01:20:25,149 --> 01:20:26,189
I'm sorry.

1507
01:20:26,189 --> 01:20:27,550
I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing.

1508
01:20:29,069 --> 01:20:29,710
I don't get it.

1509
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:30,590
Just stand still?

1510
01:20:31,149 --> 01:20:35,600
Did I miss?

1511
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:56,399
I'm going to tell you, ask me for my daughter's hand.

1512
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,239
Three, two, one.

1513
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,909
No way.

1514
01:21:04,909 --> 01:21:07,069
What the fuck are you talking about?

1515
01:21:07,069 --> 01:21:08,350
This doesn't make any sense.

1516
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:09,630
I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.

1517
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,840
I pressed every button once in a lifetime opportunity.

1518
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:22,189
All right, open your eyes now.

1519
01:21:25,819 --> 01:21:26,220
All right.

1520
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,699
You can see it.

1521
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,779
Look at it with your eyes.

1522
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:32,060
You put sunglasses on.

1523
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,460
Whatever you're supposed to do, the special ones.

1524
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:47,520
You need to look at it with the special sunglasses.

1525
01:21:54,699 --> 01:21:56,140
Why did the door not close?

1526
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:59,979
You had to hold it there?

1527
01:21:59,979 --> 01:22:00,539
I couldn't.

1528
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:01,340
I was trying to.

1529
01:22:05,079 --> 01:22:08,699
Here, eat some.

1530
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:11,180
I swear to God, half the time the input doesn't do anything.

1531
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:15,449
Match the rhythm and kick the whatever it is.

1532
01:22:15,449 --> 01:22:21,260
Okay.

1533
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:37,560
On the count of three.

1534
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,470
Nice.

1535
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:55,159
Here we go.

1536
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:59,229
New year in five, four, three, two, one.

1537
01:23:02,489 --> 01:23:03,529
What the fuck?

1538
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:06,140
I pressed happy new year.

1539
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,050
Happy new year.

1540
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:12,760
Now for the next song.

1541
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:19,020
Get a controller.

1542
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,819
I might just plug a controller in, but I feel like it's not going to do anything.

1543
01:23:21,819 --> 01:23:29,579
I don't even see controller support on this Steam page.

1544
01:23:29,579 --> 01:23:32,479
Okay, so it's time to walk.

1545
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:34,430
All right, walk.

1546
01:23:36,189 --> 01:23:40,029
Fuck.

1547
01:23:40,029 --> 01:23:43,310
Hey, why press button to clap hands?

1548
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,760
Hmm?

1549
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,640
You said clap the...

1550
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,239
You said clap hands.

1551
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:56,279
You said clap hands.

1552
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:58,989
You told me to clap my hands.

1553
01:23:58,989 --> 01:24:07,470
Do I hatch while the mom's here?

1554
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:09,420
Or hatch...

1555
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,779
No, no, I don't want to hatch with you here.

1556
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:11,579
Get the fuck out of here.

1557
01:24:25,289 --> 01:24:27,210
Staff, congratulations on graduating.

1558
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:31,369
So be our final homeroom together until the next game, which is coming up right now.

1559
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,770
Just a quick roll call, then we're finished.

1560
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:35,609
Be sure to answer when I call your name.

1561
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:44,800
The really weird thing to see looking out your window is scrolling credits.

1562
01:24:46,359 --> 01:24:48,199
At that point, you're in a simulation, right?

1563
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,880
Would that be enough for you to know?

1564
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,390
Too fast?

1565
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:02,010
What?

1566
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:04,039
Oh, there.

1567
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:08,729
And finally, you.

1568
01:25:09,369 --> 01:25:15,560
After today, you will each begin walking your own path.

1569
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:21,550
From time to time, you will find yourselves in situations where you will need to be considerate of others.

1570
01:25:22,109 --> 01:25:25,720
However, being considerate all the time isn't always a good thing.

1571
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:28,510
You need to also think of yourself.

1572
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:34,350
Being considerate of others and knowing when to take care of yourself are both vital skills.

1573
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:38,109
I want you to become strong adults.

1574
01:25:38,109 --> 01:25:39,710
There is something out this window.

1575
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:50,039
Okay, everybody stand and bow.

1576
01:25:50,039 --> 01:25:50,520
Goodbye.

1577
01:25:56,729 --> 01:25:57,609
So what did I get for...

1578
01:25:57,609 --> 01:25:59,050
What's my personality like?

1579
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:10,569
What happened?

1580
01:26:10,569 --> 01:26:12,010
I've realized how to walk.

1581
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:19,340
I just know it.

1582
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:19,899
He stood up.

1583
01:26:19,899 --> 01:26:21,100
Yep, get right in the camera.

1584
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:23,100
Camera, get the camera.

1585
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,810
What are you doing?

1586
01:26:25,369 --> 01:26:29,500
Come on, what are you doing?

1587
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:38,810
He messed that up.

1588
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:49,630
I didn't.

1589
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:54,029
Okay, total.

1590
01:26:54,029 --> 01:26:56,590
Generally considerate and understanding mediator.

1591
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:59,979
Detailed results.

1592
01:26:59,979 --> 01:27:05,720
Common sense versus specified knowledge.

1593
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,000
Above average, common sense.

1594
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,840
Commonly understood social manners and etiquette is the first step in becoming more considerate.

1595
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,159
I'm above average.

1596
01:27:13,159 --> 01:27:14,680
All right, specified knowledge.

1597
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,000
Specialized know-how that isn't commonly known.

1598
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,720
Having a lot of knowledge is an essential weapon for being more considerate.

1599
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:22,760
Average, that's fine.

1600
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,390
Spatial awareness and group dynamics.

1601
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:27,149
Average and above average for group dynamics.

1602
01:27:27,149 --> 01:27:29,710
The knowledge to understand the role others expect you to play in a group.

1603
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:33,130
Your cooperative nature leads to smooth teamwork.

1604
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:34,079
All right.

1605
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:35,439
Look at this adulting shit though.

1606
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:38,189
Look at that.

1607
01:27:38,189 --> 01:27:42,670
Ability to step back and take in the situation then assume the roles others don't want to do.

1608
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:46,319
Allowing everyone to better enjoy themselves.

1609
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:47,520
And my sympathy is pretty average.

1610
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,159
Whether or not you can put yourself in another one's shoes and understand how they feel.

1611
01:27:53,229 --> 01:27:55,550
Information integration is above average.

1612
01:27:55,550 --> 01:28:01,260
The power to instantly find the right meaning from fragmented hints with no context.

1613
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:02,460
My speed is average.

1614
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:05,020
The ability to immediately make decisions in any situation.

1615
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:10,890
The speed to understand and react to a situation.

1616
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:12,090
My rhythm is above average.

1617
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:13,689
Talent of following rhythm is instructed.

1618
01:28:13,689 --> 01:28:19,850
Being flexible with the ability to go with the flow will be useful in being considerate.

1619
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:20,810
And then interval.

1620
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,609
Good and bad intervals.

1621
01:28:21,609 --> 01:28:24,729
Whether or not you understand the best timing when enacting in a series of events.

1622
01:28:26,619 --> 01:28:28,220
I'm really good at adulting.

1623
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,289
All right, cool.

1624
01:28:31,289 --> 01:28:33,180
We got one more of these to do.

1625
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:38,079
We got one more to do.

1626
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:40,800
Average Andy.

1627
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,479
I got good and above average in like four things we're talking about.

1628
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:46,779
All right, I want to play the last one.

1629
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:58,720
This is not all we're doing today.

1630
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,840
Those of you freaking out saying that this is the end of the stream in like 30 minutes.

1631
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,199
No, you're completely inaccurate.

1632
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:10,319
We're going to be playing Roswell Agent after this.

1633
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:12,220
For the remainder of today's stream.

1634
01:29:14,909 --> 01:29:17,130
And where is it?

1635
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:22,350
All right, considerate three.

1636
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:23,630
More and more.

1637
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:29,239
Father to son in this.

1638
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:32,300
Hey, Billy Bob.

1639
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,779
Thanks for the vibe.

1640
01:29:34,779 --> 01:29:35,930
Immunity subs.

1641
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,090
Agent of Roswell.

1642
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:39,449
Yeah, Roswell Agent.

1643
01:29:39,449 --> 01:29:40,010
Agent Roswell.

1644
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:40,729
I don't know, whatever it is.

1645
01:29:41,369 --> 01:29:56,960
Why is my screen capture not picking it up?

1646
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,939
Hello?

1647
01:30:00,409 --> 01:30:04,619
There it is.

1648
01:30:04,619 --> 01:30:07,819
All right, I promised a face cam for this one, so I'll keep it on.

1649
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:10,270
Are you purple?

1650
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,039
It's a white balance in this room.

1651
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,960
You're so purple.

1652
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:24,119
I didn't think I was purple until you just said that.

1653
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,960
I don't, because the white balance is wrong.

1654
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:46,810
There, this is like what it's actually like in this room right now.

1655
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:52,909
I'm still purple?

1656
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:55,789
Whatever, I'm fucking purple.

1657
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:56,270
Who cares?

1658
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:02,810
All right, this is it.

1659
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:03,609
Press any button.

1660
01:31:03,609 --> 01:31:04,890
I think they all just control the same way.

1661
01:31:05,529 --> 01:31:10,170
All right, let's go.

1662
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:13,310
Consider it with a face cam, I promised.

1663
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:16,600
Free to consider things, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1664
01:31:17,239 --> 01:31:20,199
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1665
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:21,560
All right, number one.

1666
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:28,380
So I would grab onto right here.

1667
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:32,670
Because I'm not going to just stand there.

1668
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:33,229
That's dangerous.

1669
01:31:33,229 --> 01:31:33,869
You could get hurt.

1670
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:38,600
That's it.

1671
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:42,760
You look like a plum.

1672
01:31:47,789 --> 01:31:48,670
Welcome, you.

1673
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,470
Glad you're here.

1674
01:31:50,189 --> 01:31:53,689
The world is an estate at the hands of the Demon King.

1675
01:31:54,489 --> 01:31:57,149
Okay.

1676
01:31:57,949 --> 01:31:59,069
Would you help save it?

1677
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:03,100
Yeah.

1678
01:32:03,979 --> 01:32:04,300
Money?

1679
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:11,449
Yes, I'll help.

1680
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:15,130
This one's correct.

1681
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:19,340
Store your mayonnaise upside down.

1682
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,720
Store some of your, most of your condiments upside down.

1683
01:32:22,279 --> 01:32:36,670
Store your bread upside down.

1684
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:38,750
The consider it mart.

1685
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:43,079
I'm just going to go to the one that has less people.

1686
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:53,340
Did I bumper?

1687
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,960
Don't change the lines.

1688
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,319
What do you mean don't change the lines?

1689
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:05,310
That helps like the store stay efficient.

1690
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:07,149
And yeah, you change lines.

1691
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:08,909
Oh no, I'm late.

1692
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:17,449
That's going to barrel through people.

1693
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,560
Okay, big bro.

1694
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,439
I'm so hungry.

1695
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:27,560
Big bro has something to do.

1696
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,029
Old made championship.

1697
01:33:30,029 --> 01:33:32,119
All right, don't get this wrong.

1698
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:33,239
Final round.

1699
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:35,159
Who will win the all you can eat sushi prize?

1700
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:42,270
Did I what?

1701
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:42,829
I don't know.

1702
01:33:42,829 --> 01:33:44,109
What was I supposed to do?

1703
01:33:44,109 --> 01:33:48,380
I'm going to take the picture.

1704
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:49,020
All right, I gotta get in.

1705
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:52,880
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1706
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:53,199
Right here.

1707
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:59,420
Am I like shouting out something?

1708
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,380
I'm doing an ad.

1709
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:08,720
All right, movie feedback.

1710
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:14,779
And then be pissed that they're taking so long.

1711
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:22,840
I would not stand up.

1712
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:23,479
Marathon.

1713
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:27,760
We'll reach the goal together.

1714
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:29,130
We sure will.

1715
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:35,279
All right, I'm going to make this look good.

1716
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:36,159
But I still want to win.

1717
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:37,500
You know what I mean?

1718
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:41,770
We're almost there.

1719
01:34:42,489 --> 01:34:44,590
Like I won.

1720
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:47,979
It was close.

1721
01:34:47,979 --> 01:34:49,500
It was so close.

1722
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,180
But I fucking win.

1723
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:58,409
Yeah, remember we were like neck and neck.

1724
01:34:58,409 --> 01:34:59,930
Yeah, it could have been anybody's game.

1725
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:00,569
But it was still me.

1726
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:03,149
I can't believe I won.

1727
01:35:03,149 --> 01:35:03,710
What the fuck?

1728
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,109
I know.

1729
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:07,960
That's not what do you mean it's bad friend?

1730
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:11,340
That's a planetary ego.

1731
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,880
A planetary ego would just be to sprint.

1732
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,199
Take both cups of water that they were handing both of us.

1733
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:18,239
Drink them both.

1734
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:21,770
Throw the cups on the ground and sprint to the finish.

1735
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:23,050
I stayed with my friend.

1736
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:25,289
I knew I was capable of winning the race.

1737
01:35:25,289 --> 01:35:27,289
But I stayed with my friend.

1738
01:35:27,289 --> 01:35:28,090
We talked about shit.

1739
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:30,090
We were hanging out jogging and we did it on our own time.

1740
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:31,449
But I got in first place.

1741
01:35:31,449 --> 01:35:40,960
I didn't.

1742
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,119
Somebody said going easy is not considerate.

1743
01:35:45,659 --> 01:35:46,859
All right, I hope it reaches him.

1744
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:57,770
What?

1745
01:35:57,770 --> 01:35:59,050
I was supposed to hit him in the head?

1746
01:35:59,050 --> 01:35:59,449
What?

1747
01:35:59,449 --> 01:36:00,489
Why not?

1748
01:36:00,489 --> 01:36:00,729
What?

1749
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:03,930
That was very unclear.

1750
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:08,189
Is it going to roll over me?

1751
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:18,680
I found a funny video.

1752
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,800
Yeah, let's do it.

1753
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,970
It's going to be the two...

1754
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:21,449
I knew it.

1755
01:36:21,449 --> 01:36:23,289
It was going to be the two lions having sex.

1756
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:26,109
And this is an ad.

1757
01:36:26,109 --> 01:36:28,109
Why is this an ad on YouTube?

1758
01:36:28,109 --> 01:36:33,479
I'm not...

1759
01:36:33,479 --> 01:36:33,960
I want...

1760
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:34,359
Why?

1761
01:36:34,359 --> 01:36:35,239
I would be...

1762
01:36:35,239 --> 01:36:36,520
Fuck the considerate shit.

1763
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,239
I would be so confused as to why that existed.

1764
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:45,310
Next stop is your stop.

1765
01:36:45,869 --> 01:36:47,789
Announce it.

1766
01:36:47,789 --> 01:36:53,079
You can be considerate...

1767
01:36:53,079 --> 01:37:09,689
The fuck doesn't do that?

1768
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,760
Who doesn't do that?

1769
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,640
If you get one of those clickable mechanical pencils,

1770
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:26,109
one of the first thing you're going to do that

1771
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:27,869
until it all comes all the way out.

1772
01:37:27,869 --> 01:37:30,270
And then you're going to try to write with it

1773
01:37:31,659 --> 01:37:32,859
and to be really gentle and be like,

1774
01:37:32,859 --> 01:37:34,300
holy shit, can I do this?

1775
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,899
And it's going to break in half

1776
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:36,939
and you're going to go, fuck, whatever.

1777
01:37:36,939 --> 01:37:38,300
And then you're going to pick up the pieces.

1778
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,699
You're going to unscrew the top of the thing,

1779
01:37:40,699 --> 01:37:42,779
put the pieces back in because it doesn't matter.

1780
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:44,060
It's not like you have to throw it away.

1781
01:37:45,689 --> 01:37:47,369
Going like this and going like this,

1782
01:37:47,369 --> 01:37:50,329
you put the lead back, the graphite back in the top.

1783
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:57,159
What are you guys talking about?

1784
01:37:57,159 --> 01:37:58,359
You just put it back in.

1785
01:38:01,229 --> 01:38:02,270
You can refill them?

1786
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:02,510
Yeah.

1787
01:38:03,819 --> 01:38:04,779
Yes, you can.

1788
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:06,619
What do you mean you can't refill them?

1789
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:14,409
That's, I, where, what planet are you guys on?

1790
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:17,359
You did, did, did, did, did, did the slider,

1791
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:18,319
did, did, did, did, did the slider.

1792
01:38:18,319 --> 01:38:20,319
And you put the, the eraser comes off

1793
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:21,600
and you put it inside where the eraser is.

1794
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,479
Did you not know that?

1795
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:23,840
Hold on, what do I have to do?

1796
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:30,859
I, did I get it?

1797
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:35,500
I got it.

1798
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:40,060
That is confirmed stupid.

1799
01:38:45,979 --> 01:38:47,340
Oh, watch out for the, yeah, old lady.

1800
01:38:47,899 --> 01:38:49,180
You go ahead and sit down.

1801
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:51,340
But like, holy shit, fucking hurry up.

1802
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:52,380
The train is moving.

1803
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:55,000
Okay, we're good.

1804
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,180
I think that would be dangerous.

1805
01:38:59,819 --> 01:39:04,569
If you did that to a mechanical pencil,

1806
01:39:04,569 --> 01:39:05,689
we would no longer be friends.

1807
01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:07,930
Bye bye.

1808
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:12,960
Reporting from the field.

1809
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:13,680
That's it from me.

1810
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,720
Wait, should I not be over here?

1811
01:39:23,949 --> 01:39:26,880
It's hot.

1812
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,909
Open the window a little.

1813
01:39:28,909 --> 01:39:30,909
This is a waste collection truck.

1814
01:39:30,909 --> 01:39:31,470
Wait, what?

1815
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:36,350
TVs.

1816
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:46,359
No, I, but will the smelly, smelly air come up here?

1817
01:39:46,359 --> 01:39:46,920
What?

1818
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:50,460
I'm trying to have the, this is a waste collection truck.

1819
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,659
Okay, I know you're trying to pay attention,

1820
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:57,340
but like, it's, that's, that's good.

1821
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:02,029
The author feels, I don't know if it's okay that,

1822
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:02,989
I opened the window and it said,

1823
01:40:02,989 --> 01:40:04,430
we're a garbage collection truck.

1824
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:04,670
I don't know.

1825
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:06,350
I figured they was going to go in there and smell.

1826
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:17,949
Can you, are you going to do something about that?

1827
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:25,000
I think I'm pretty considerate.

1828
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,039
Come back.

1829
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,000
What?

1830
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:50,079
Is he muted?

1831
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:55,199
Stand up.

1832
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:56,159
Sit, no, don't sit.

1833
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:56,720
Should I sit?

1834
01:40:57,439 --> 01:40:59,819
I feel like this is way more inconsiderate

1835
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:02,060
than just standing and not leaning back like an asshole.

1836
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:14,890
Come back up.

1837
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:15,449
Come back up.

1838
01:41:17,229 --> 01:41:19,869
Uh, dude, I can't pull it back up.

1839
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:24,560
I don't understand.

1840
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,439
None of them worked.

1841
01:41:26,329 --> 01:41:28,170
I don't, I don't, I don't, what the fuck?

1842
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:30,460
I'm a crab.

1843
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:30,779
All right.

1844
01:41:30,779 --> 01:41:31,500
Should I get out of the way?

1845
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:31,979
Go in the water.

1846
01:41:32,539 --> 01:41:38,489
I have to hold it?

1847
01:41:38,489 --> 01:41:38,810
I did.

1848
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:42,909
I swear to God.

1849
01:41:42,909 --> 01:41:44,029
Good luck in Tokyo.

1850
01:41:44,029 --> 01:41:46,250
Yeah, I'll write to you.

1851
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:47,210
Yeah.

1852
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:12,159
Uh, that's fucking, that was creepy.

1853
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:19,500
It's like, I'm making sure you're actually on the train in the seat.

1854
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:19,979
For what?

1855
01:42:19,979 --> 01:42:21,640
For some reason.

1856
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,640
Like, I got to make sure you're actually sitting down doing that

1857
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:26,600
because I'm about to go this way real fast and, and do something.

1858
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:27,960
It's weird.

1859
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,640
Why would you need to, it's weird.

1860
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:34,960
Psychotic behavior.

1861
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:40,239
Hey, where are the dentists?

1862
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,079
Raise your hand if you feel any pain.

1863
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:47,079
We're almost done.

1864
01:42:47,079 --> 01:42:48,760
This hurts a little more.

1865
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:49,319
It hurts.

1866
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:50,520
It hurts.

1867
01:42:51,479 --> 01:42:54,279
You didn't give me an Innova can, you fucking monster doctor.

1868
01:42:54,279 --> 01:42:55,000
What are you doing?

1869
01:42:58,649 --> 01:42:59,210
It hurts.

1870
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:13,520
Wait.

1871
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,000
Oh no.

1872
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,319
Okay.

1873
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,079
I was like, where should I go?

1874
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,819
Is it inconsiderate to say you're in pain?

1875
01:43:21,819 --> 01:43:22,539
That's what I'm saying.

1876
01:43:22,539 --> 01:43:23,020
Like what?

1877
01:43:23,659 --> 01:43:27,760
If a dentist is just drilling my mouth and it hurts, I'm going to go like this.

1878
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:31,720
Right?

1879
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:32,359
Wait, hold on.

1880
01:43:38,829 --> 01:43:39,390
Got it.

1881
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:40,029
Nice.

1882
01:43:40,029 --> 01:43:42,560
Yeah.

1883
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,600
You make an audible like.

1884
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:50,779
If somebody's drilling inside your mouth, you do not want to make a bunch of movements.

1885
01:43:51,420 --> 01:44:00,380
Like if somebody has a drill sticking out of your fucking mouth,

1886
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:03,130
I don't want to be like, oh, that hurt me.

1887
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:03,850
Ouchies.

1888
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:04,810
No, that they'll fuck.

1889
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:05,529
No way.

1890
01:44:05,529 --> 01:44:06,170
You go like this.

1891
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:11,239
And then they go, fuck.

1892
01:44:11,239 --> 01:44:11,560
Okay.

1893
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:11,880
All right.

1894
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:16,810
Turn the wind down.

1895
01:44:16,810 --> 01:44:26,039
And then when you hear the drill, power down.

1896
01:44:26,039 --> 01:44:26,600
They look at you.

1897
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,159
Everything okay?

1898
01:44:27,159 --> 01:44:43,210
And then you go, oh, I hurt because he's still afraid something back it up.

1899
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:44,489
Oh my God.

1900
01:44:44,489 --> 01:44:46,090
That was a lot of power.

1901
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,329
I was not expecting that.

1902
01:45:00,699 --> 01:45:02,220
Dude, that's weird.

1903
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:05,319
Am I supposed to be falling off?

1904
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:10,359
No, I think I said to get it.

1905
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:19,000
Downloading 27%.

1906
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:21,609
How would it go backwards?

1907
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:32,220
That made no sense.

1908
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:34,300
I pressed to like, I was trying to.

1909
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:35,180
That made no sense.

1910
01:45:35,739 --> 01:45:37,260
Okay.

1911
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:37,979
Look at this graph.

1912
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:38,779
I was trying to fill it.

1913
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:41,550
They made apps of fucking.

1914
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:42,829
The guy's fly is done.

1915
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:03,100
Broccoli broccoli.

1916
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:06,619
And then the ketchup and then I don't.

1917
01:46:06,619 --> 01:46:07,659
What am I looking at here?

1918
01:46:07,659 --> 01:46:08,300
This food.

1919
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:11,640
What the fuck?

1920
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:15,640
Oh, I'm putting a condiment on my food.

1921
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,840
I thought I was selecting what food I wanted to eat first in what order.

1922
01:46:19,479 --> 01:46:21,560
This cow is so cute.

1923
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:26,399
Yeah, let's get some lunch.

1924
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:27,119
I'm starving.

1925
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:36,380
Why are we crying?

1926
01:46:36,939 --> 01:46:52,430
That was sad.

1927
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:56,350
A comment.

1928
01:46:56,909 --> 01:47:03,600
Oh, I like this.

1929
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:04,640
I liked this video.

1930
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:11,880
I guess I have a date with my boyfriend today.

1931
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:12,119
Okay.

1932
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:28,010
I mean, it's fine.

1933
01:47:28,010 --> 01:47:34,300
Yeah, that's fine.

1934
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:36,060
Going in the haunted house with your boyfriend.

1935
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:39,960
It's scary.

1936
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:45,149
Hold me.

1937
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:48,909
What?

1938
01:47:48,909 --> 01:47:51,869
Why are we putting our hands up?

1939
01:47:51,869 --> 01:48:00,649
Why did he, why was he freaked out by that?

1940
01:48:00,649 --> 01:48:02,970
Next up, a roller coaster with my boyfriend.

1941
01:48:03,609 --> 01:48:04,649
Here we go.

1942
01:48:04,649 --> 01:48:05,210
We're going to have fun.

1943
01:48:12,829 --> 01:48:19,199
Whoa, that was crazy.

1944
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,159
Did you have fun?

1945
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:34,720
Oh, you, you listen to it too together.

1946
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:43,770
That's always like a nice thing to do.

1947
01:48:44,409 --> 01:48:50,890
But unfortunately, it's like really impractical because if usually you'll forget, it's the,

1948
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:52,489
it's really this far, right?

1949
01:48:52,489 --> 01:48:54,010
You don't have very much distance.

1950
01:48:54,010 --> 01:48:58,430
So, so one of the two will forget that it's in and just be like, oh, cool.

1951
01:48:58,430 --> 01:48:59,789
And go over here.

1952
01:48:59,789 --> 01:49:04,189
And it like essentially like fucking strangles the person and like rips out of their ear

1953
01:49:04,189 --> 01:49:08,520
and shit just simply by tilting your head like, like this.

1954
01:49:09,529 --> 01:49:10,329
It sucks.

1955
01:49:10,329 --> 01:49:16,479
I'm surprised they haven't made like just a quad earbud thing at this point.

1956
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:18,479
Like to prevent this from happening.

1957
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:20,159
Why not just have like a, I mean, you can get a splitter,

1958
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:23,600
but why not make one that's just like four so we can both listen.

1959
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:28,300
I have that wireless.

1960
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:31,630
No, but I want to be connected.

1961
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:33,710
Wireless means we can literally sit across the fucking room.

1962
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:37,310
If you have a TV or something, or you have like a big iPad or phone,

1963
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:38,670
I can like sit over here.

1964
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:42,270
I want to be like close, but not constricted.

1965
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:43,149
You understand?

1966
01:49:43,149 --> 01:49:45,079
Because then one of us can go like this.

1967
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:51,210
You know, one of us can be like, oh, look at this.

1968
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:56,399
And they're like, oh, that's cute.

1969
01:49:57,770 --> 01:49:58,409
That's the fuck.

1970
01:49:58,409 --> 01:49:58,729
Come on.

1971
01:49:58,729 --> 01:49:59,930
You guys don't know how to be cute.

1972
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:00,489
Give me a break.

1973
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:08,479
It's time to pay the bill.

1974
01:50:10,859 --> 01:50:12,220
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

1975
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:12,779
All right, fine.

1976
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:14,750
You can pay for it.

1977
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,350
I got a date tomorrow.

1978
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:25,069
Tomorrow's the field trip.

1979
01:50:25,069 --> 01:50:26,350
Tomorrow's the outdoor concert.

1980
01:50:26,989 --> 01:50:29,789
I'm not going to like attack with a fucking tornado.

1981
01:50:30,430 --> 01:50:41,560
There we go.

1982
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:49,819
Just enough for me to drop the fucking energy beam, right?

1983
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:54,170
There comes, there comes a monster attack.

1984
01:51:02,779 --> 01:51:03,500
What's today's date?

1985
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,899
Oh shit.

1986
01:51:05,899 --> 01:51:07,180
No, I'll take, I'll take the one that's half off.

1987
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:15,020
Thanks, demon weather god.

1988
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:21,210
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

1989
01:51:25,479 --> 01:51:26,439
Yeah, you can take that.

1990
01:51:26,439 --> 01:51:27,000
You can do it.

1991
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:27,479
That's fine.

1992
01:51:28,199 --> 01:51:31,229
It really depends on how far away you are.

1993
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:40,060
If, okay, if I can see you across the grocery store

1994
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:42,430
and you're making your way here, I'm going in front of you.

1995
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:50,560
If you are within like 10 to 15 feet, then yeah, I'll do that.

1996
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:55,550
But I'm sorry, if you, if you're like across the whole store,

1997
01:51:55,550 --> 01:51:57,149
I don't know, you could be going to a different aisle.

1998
01:51:57,149 --> 01:51:57,789
I don't know.

1999
01:51:57,789 --> 01:52:10,039
And you're yelling, hurry up.

2000
01:52:10,039 --> 01:52:13,600
That was you and me talking about that.

2001
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:14,800
I wouldn't, that, hold on.

2002
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,760
First of all, what's going on?

2003
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:17,979
Excuse me.

2004
01:52:18,539 --> 01:52:19,020
Excuse me.

2005
01:52:19,659 --> 01:52:20,380
Excuse me.

2006
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:20,859
Excuse me.

2007
01:52:20,859 --> 01:52:21,500
Pay attention.

2008
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:21,979
Excuse me.

2009
01:52:21,979 --> 01:52:22,460
Pay attention.

2010
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:23,899
Pay attention.

2011
01:52:23,899 --> 01:52:31,640
Can I turn around and say like, watch where you're fucking going?

2012
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,000
Camping experience tour.

2013
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,720
Start a fire.

2014
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:39,229
Get a fire going before I, should I put the sun out?

2015
01:52:39,229 --> 01:52:45,800
Get a fire going so I can go to bed.

2016
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:51,130
Get a fire started.

2017
01:52:51,130 --> 01:52:52,409
They just suck.

2018
01:52:52,409 --> 01:52:56,079
Consider it.

2019
01:52:56,079 --> 01:52:57,439
The title is partially displayed.

2020
01:52:57,439 --> 01:53:03,760
Wait, are we playing the game?

2021
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:04,720
Oh, consider it together.

2022
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:06,159
We're going to play the co-op.

2023
01:53:11,399 --> 01:53:19,159
You became stranded.

2024
01:53:19,159 --> 01:53:21,159
Do I keep, I gotta keep him awake?

2025
01:53:21,159 --> 01:53:35,600
Could you get us some tea, please?

2026
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,239
Sure.

2027
01:53:37,239 --> 01:53:38,119
Green tea.

2028
01:53:38,119 --> 01:53:44,319
That's what they wanted, right?

2029
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:52,199
Okay, here you go.

2030
01:53:52,199 --> 01:53:52,439
What?

2031
01:53:52,439 --> 01:53:52,920
What'd I do?

2032
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:01,020
Okay.

2033
01:54:01,579 --> 01:54:03,020
And you make mine a little sweet.

2034
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:03,340
Got it.

2035
01:54:06,829 --> 01:54:07,149
One.

2036
01:54:07,149 --> 01:54:07,550
That's it.

2037
01:54:08,109 --> 01:54:11,720
People are weird about sugar in their coffee.

2038
01:54:12,279 --> 01:54:15,199
Some people take one sip of something with one sugar in it

2039
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:16,159
and they like want to spit it out.

2040
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:20,319
And some people want like 50 sugars in it

2041
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:21,840
and they think it tastes bland.

2042
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,439
I don't even know what the fuck they were just saying.

2043
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:23,760
Heaven.

2044
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,199
I don't do sugar for people.

2045
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:31,439
Ever.

2046
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:36,300
If somebody ever tells you,

2047
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:38,460
oh yeah, you just put some sugar in it for me.

2048
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:40,029
You go, no.

2049
01:54:40,029 --> 01:54:41,630
You bring over a few of sugars

2050
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:43,869
or a few packets of whatever or like sweetener

2051
01:54:43,869 --> 01:54:44,909
and you just say, here you go.

2052
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:46,909
I'm not responsible for that

2053
01:54:46,909 --> 01:54:47,710
because people don't like it.

2054
01:54:55,159 --> 01:54:56,359
Turtles are so slow.

2055
01:54:56,359 --> 01:54:57,640
Whoa, that's not true.

2056
01:54:58,359 --> 01:55:01,659
Wanna race me?

2057
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:04,159
Sure.

2058
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:10,619
They didn't tell me it was Mario Kart.

2059
01:55:10,619 --> 01:55:14,840
Oh, I just like killed the turtle and the bunny.

2060
01:55:19,689 --> 01:55:20,649
I win.

2061
01:55:20,649 --> 01:55:23,449
That's the most important part.

2062
01:55:23,449 --> 01:55:46,680
I'm trying to switch them.

2063
01:55:47,319 --> 01:55:51,760
Were we together?

2064
01:55:58,109 --> 01:55:59,789
Uh, just to come out of the snow?

2065
01:56:01,789 --> 01:56:06,140
What's considerate about that?

2066
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:07,260
Oh shit, Darth Vader.

2067
01:56:07,899 --> 01:56:14,079
How long does it need to be?

2068
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,600
Make it like a spear.

2069
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:21,149
Okay.

2070
01:56:21,149 --> 01:56:25,399
Would you get us some tea, please?

2071
01:56:25,399 --> 01:56:26,199
Yes, I can.

2072
01:56:26,199 --> 01:56:38,170
How do I stop pouring?

2073
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:39,369
How do I stop pouring?

2074
01:56:39,369 --> 01:56:39,770
There we go.

2075
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:48,430
You hear that.

2076
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:49,310
How do I stop pouring?

2077
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:50,750
I don't know how to stop pouring.

2078
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:51,920
I don't understand.

2079
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:56,439
How do I stop?

2080
01:56:56,439 --> 01:56:58,119
Whoa, that's a little too much though.

2081
01:56:58,119 --> 01:56:59,239
That's not considerate.

2082
01:56:59,239 --> 01:57:13,159
Well, it didn't do the thing where you stand in front.

2083
01:57:13,159 --> 01:57:16,430
So you get them moving

2084
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:18,350
and then you go into the front.

2085
01:57:18,350 --> 01:57:20,510
So you stand in front of them while they're going like this

2086
01:57:20,510 --> 01:57:22,750
and you go like, no, whoa!

2087
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:23,470
When they get close

2088
01:57:23,470 --> 01:57:25,470
and you pretend like you got flew backwards from them.

2089
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:27,199
You're not doing that.

2090
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:38,029
That's inconsiderate.

2091
01:57:38,029 --> 01:57:38,670
All right.

2092
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:39,470
Considerate.

2093
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:41,069
Which considerate is this?

2094
01:57:41,069 --> 01:57:41,710
Three.

2095
01:57:41,710 --> 01:57:49,229
What was he talking about?

2096
01:57:49,229 --> 01:57:51,069
Do I have to explain that?

2097
01:57:51,069 --> 01:57:51,710
I'm a guide bot.

2098
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:53,390
If you want to know where to go, just ask me.

2099
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:57,079
People always force me to work.

2100
01:57:57,079 --> 01:57:58,520
I'll revenge you one day.

2101
01:58:02,029 --> 01:58:02,590
Lost kid.

2102
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:04,109
Lost.

2103
01:58:04,109 --> 01:58:04,590
Go that way.

2104
01:58:05,149 --> 01:58:07,920
That way.

2105
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:21,949
Going to the arcade with my boyfriend.

2106
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:23,449
Punch.

2107
01:58:23,449 --> 01:58:23,770
Fight.

2108
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:27,239
The boyfriend did it really well.

2109
01:58:27,239 --> 01:58:28,760
Should I go lower?

2110
01:58:34,539 --> 01:58:35,420
Way stronger.

2111
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:35,739
All right.

2112
01:58:35,739 --> 01:58:36,939
That's all right.

2113
01:58:36,939 --> 01:58:37,500
Whatever.

2114
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:40,000
It wasn't my fault,

2115
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,840
but I have to apologize in the next three seconds.

2116
01:58:42,649 --> 01:58:44,170
What button is apologize?

2117
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:47,500
It was left.

2118
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:59,260
It was left.

2119
01:58:59,260 --> 01:58:59,739
What is that?

2120
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:01,720
I don't know what this is.

2121
01:59:02,439 --> 01:59:07,550
They put it out.

2122
01:59:10,199 --> 01:59:11,159
I don't know what that was.

2123
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:12,520
It was a fireworks sparkler.

2124
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:13,800
Why would I be holding it upside down?

2125
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:17,739
Who holds it like this?

2126
01:59:18,539 --> 01:59:19,100
Like that.

2127
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:19,579
What are you?

2128
01:59:19,579 --> 01:59:20,060
Out of your mind?

2129
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:29,100
You became stranded again.

2130
01:59:38,119 --> 01:59:39,720
Buddy, you're a boy.

2131
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:40,359
I can't do this.

2132
01:59:40,359 --> 01:59:41,239
Nobody can do that.

2133
01:59:41,239 --> 01:59:43,659
That's what I'm supposed to do.

2134
01:59:43,659 --> 01:59:48,699
Not even going to attempt.

2135
01:59:48,699 --> 01:59:50,220
I'm not doing another like singing thing

2136
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:51,260
and get all fucked up from it.

2137
01:59:52,250 --> 01:59:53,529
Working from home today.

2138
01:59:53,529 --> 01:59:59,770
Some rest.

2139
01:59:59,770 --> 02:00:02,880
It was almost a funny number.

2140
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,279
Uh-oh.

2141
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:05,319
Not good.

2142
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:05,880
Not good.

2143
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:07,960
Can't hold it in.

2144
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:11,869
Can't hold who?

2145
02:00:13,689 --> 02:00:14,409
Oh, shit.

2146
02:00:14,409 --> 02:00:15,930
I'm going to the bathroom.

2147
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:26,109
Okay.

2148
02:00:26,109 --> 02:00:26,829
Little flush.

2149
02:00:26,829 --> 02:00:28,510
What are you doing for your birthday?

2150
02:00:28,510 --> 02:00:32,439
Maybe I should start preparing something.

2151
02:00:32,439 --> 02:00:34,520
Now, if you want to hide,

2152
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:35,560
you want to hide,

2153
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:37,800
here's a pro tip for all of you.

2154
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,449
If you want to hide

2155
02:00:39,449 --> 02:00:40,090
and you're like,

2156
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:40,970
holy shit,

2157
02:00:40,970 --> 02:00:41,770
what am I going to do?

2158
02:00:42,489 --> 02:00:43,529
I'm in the bathroom right now.

2159
02:00:43,529 --> 02:00:45,210
I don't want them to hear me in the bathroom.

2160
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:46,010
Okay.

2161
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:46,810
Here's what you have to do.

2162
02:00:47,449 --> 02:00:48,569
You do a flush.

2163
02:00:49,470 --> 02:00:50,590
You hold that thing down.

2164
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:51,949
You do a big fucking flush.

2165
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:54,829
And when you hear the like,

2166
02:00:54,829 --> 02:00:55,710
go, go, go, go, go,

2167
02:00:55,710 --> 02:00:57,229
it going into the tank,

2168
02:00:57,229 --> 02:00:59,319
like down into the tube.

2169
02:00:59,319 --> 02:01:00,279
That's when you shit.

2170
02:01:00,279 --> 02:01:02,720
You should go, you shit right there.

2171
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,520
The sound will,

2172
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:04,159
it'll be masked.

2173
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:05,920
It'll be sounding like the end of the toilet.

2174
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:06,420
Like that.

2175
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:09,420
Trust me.

2176
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:10,220
If you time it right,

2177
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:11,739
no one will fucking ever know what happened.

2178
02:01:11,739 --> 02:01:18,670
I'm eating.

2179
02:01:19,229 --> 02:01:22,430
Happy birthday.

2180
02:01:23,069 --> 02:01:24,119
Blow my candle up.

2181
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:26,779
How cute.

2182
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:27,819
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2183
02:01:27,819 --> 02:01:28,319
What?

2184
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:29,819
I couldn't do it.

2185
02:01:29,819 --> 02:01:31,020
Oh, I'm the candle.

2186
02:01:31,819 --> 02:01:33,369
How do I go back up?

2187
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:35,640
I can't.

2188
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:37,079
I'm holding up arrow right now.

2189
02:01:37,079 --> 02:01:38,359
All I can do is hold down.

2190
02:01:38,359 --> 02:01:48,439
That was wicked fucked up.

2191
02:01:48,439 --> 02:01:49,159
The thing I just said,

2192
02:01:49,159 --> 02:01:50,039
but whatever.

2193
02:01:50,039 --> 02:01:51,359
It works.

2194
02:01:51,819 --> 02:01:53,130
Be careful.

2195
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:53,609
Don't go too,

2196
02:01:53,609 --> 02:01:54,250
you got to be gentle.

2197
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:05,260
You want more slices?

2198
02:02:05,979 --> 02:02:09,609
What kind of weirdo?

2199
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:15,930
Okay.

2200
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:16,760
Hello.

2201
02:02:17,850 --> 02:02:18,729
I'm ZZ,

2202
02:02:18,729 --> 02:02:20,010
the VTuber.

2203
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:21,210
Just have to adjust a few settings.

2204
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:21,930
Hold on a second.

2205
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:46,060
Extra large.

2206
02:02:46,060 --> 02:02:47,500
I brought my own bottle.

2207
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:48,460
Extra large.

2208
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:52,909
All right.

2209
02:02:52,909 --> 02:02:53,390
That's enough.

2210
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:54,829
You don't need to take the whole goddamn thing.

2211
02:02:55,470 --> 02:03:07,470
That's how I feel when you put the cam on.

2212
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:08,350
Oh, get out of here.

2213
02:03:08,350 --> 02:03:09,149
Train your brain.

2214
02:03:11,079 --> 02:03:13,159
Guess how many people are left in the house?

2215
02:03:13,159 --> 02:03:15,630
One, two, three.

2216
02:03:20,479 --> 02:03:21,680
There could have been people in there before.

2217
02:03:22,239 --> 02:03:23,239
Three.

2218
02:03:23,239 --> 02:03:26,810
There's one person left.

2219
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:27,529
I don't know.

2220
02:03:27,529 --> 02:03:28,329
Input your answer.

2221
02:03:29,739 --> 02:03:30,619
I, but it didn't,

2222
02:03:30,619 --> 02:03:31,659
I don't have all the info though.

2223
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:32,779
Right?

2224
02:03:32,779 --> 02:03:34,220
Like there could be somebody actually in there still.

2225
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:35,500
It could be somebody else's house.

2226
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:41,640
Oh, 911.

2227
02:03:51,470 --> 02:03:53,470
I'm for the explosion scene.

2228
02:03:53,470 --> 02:03:55,630
I mean, it's everything with explosions.

2229
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:56,590
There's only one chance.

2230
02:03:57,390 --> 02:04:02,000
You got it.

2231
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,600
That was perfect.

2232
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:07,319
That was perfect.

2233
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:11,529
Would you get us some tea, please?

2234
02:04:11,529 --> 02:04:11,770
Yes.

2235
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:15,630
Water, milk.

2236
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:16,750
How do I, how do I make tea?

2237
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:19,149
There's no tea.

2238
02:04:19,149 --> 02:04:22,039
Is there tea bags?

2239
02:04:25,550 --> 02:04:26,510
Where's tea?

2240
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:31,420
There's no tea.

2241
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:36,079
I haven't lunch with a client today.

2242
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,539
Okay.

2243
02:04:38,539 --> 02:04:39,739
We're going to go to the family diner.

2244
02:04:41,069 --> 02:04:41,949
The cabaret?

2245
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:47,239
I see.

2246
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:49,640
Please take care of it.

2247
02:04:50,279 --> 02:04:54,220
Understood.

2248
02:04:54,220 --> 02:05:16,649
It's like a chatter.

2249
02:05:17,930 --> 02:05:18,670
All right.

2250
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:19,149
Watch out.

2251
02:05:20,029 --> 02:05:25,050
What do I do?

2252
02:05:32,569 --> 02:05:37,340
Um, oh, it's, I'm the bullet.

2253
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:39,979
Nice job.

2254
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:49,739
But like, I, the water is probably considerate, right?

2255
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:53,659
I would think so.

2256
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,760
Uh, catch this person.

2257
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:09,149
I don't know if that was considered or not.

2258
02:06:09,149 --> 02:06:21,149
The end.

2259
02:06:21,149 --> 02:06:22,029
Oh, right.

2260
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:24,829
No, but I, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

2261
02:06:24,829 --> 02:06:26,750
I, look at, look at me, look at me.

2262
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:31,420
During the credits, what you do is you slowly start to get up.

2263
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:33,659
You start to do the thing where everyone starts to stretch a little bit.

2264
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:35,579
You get into the aisle.

2265
02:06:37,310 --> 02:06:39,869
What's the fuck is going, what?

2266
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:44,670
Turn the cam off.

2267
02:06:44,670 --> 02:06:45,390
Turn the cam off.

2268
02:06:47,279 --> 02:06:50,359
Um, anyways.

2269
02:06:50,359 --> 02:06:53,720
Everybody gets up and you slowly make your way into the aisle

2270
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:56,760
and you just walk like one mile per hour.

2271
02:06:57,399 --> 02:06:58,840
You walk so slow.

2272
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:00,569
What am I doing here?

2273
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:04,640
Exit.

2274
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:10,489
Oh, it was the kids wanted me to do that.

2275
02:07:10,489 --> 02:07:11,130
Okay.

2276
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:24,300
That it?

2277
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:27,340
That what I, I got my fingers all over the sauce.

2278
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:29,640
All right, that's fucking disgusting.

2279
02:07:30,909 --> 02:07:32,909
I would actually be pissed about that.

2280
02:07:32,909 --> 02:07:37,869
What am I doing with my hands?

2281
02:07:37,869 --> 02:07:41,550
Why is it no like fork or chopsticks or utensil or what?

2282
02:07:41,550 --> 02:07:42,109
I don't understand.

2283
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:45,319
Why would I be dipping sushi like that with my hands?

2284
02:07:49,279 --> 02:07:49,680
Fork?

2285
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:50,159
I don't know.

2286
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,560
I use chopsticks.

2287
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:56,060
It's the traditional way.

2288
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:56,779
What?

2289
02:07:56,779 --> 02:07:59,050
Eating sushi with your hand?

2290
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:04,720
I'd never ask for a fork.

2291
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,560
I always use chopsticks.

2292
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:07,680
I know how to use them.

2293
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:13,609
You eat sushi with your hands.

2294
02:08:13,609 --> 02:08:15,050
It's a hand food.

2295
02:08:15,050 --> 02:08:16,750
That's the traditional way.

2296
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:20,729
Oh, prove it.

2297
02:08:20,729 --> 02:08:27,310
When we come back from break, after this game is done,

2298
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:31,149
I'll, I'll go get chopsticks and I'll show you that I can use them.

2299
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:32,520
Fine.

2300
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,300
Fine.

2301
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:39,180
Fork works better.

2302
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:41,739
I'm, don't say that.

2303
02:08:41,739 --> 02:08:42,140
Watch out.

2304
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:45,260
I'm very, everyone's really upset about you for saying that.

2305
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:50,720
Would it be, what am I doing?

2306
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:52,319
I'm drinking a lot of drinks.

2307
02:08:52,319 --> 02:08:55,640
Only just drink two.

2308
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:57,840
When it comes to men, there are just so many of them.

2309
02:08:58,399 --> 02:09:02,409
I'm sure there's someone out there, yeah, who can see me from where I am.

2310
02:09:02,409 --> 02:09:02,810
That's right.

2311
02:09:03,369 --> 02:09:06,380
Two drinks, no more than that.

2312
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:09,069
Will you back me up?

2313
02:09:09,069 --> 02:09:28,060
I'm sorry, but like, get out of the fucking way.

2314
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:33,210
I didn't mean to bump you, but like, I'm very clearly way ahead of you by now.

2315
02:09:33,210 --> 02:09:34,409
But get out of the fucking way.

2316
02:09:34,409 --> 02:09:35,770
You don't own the sidewalk, fuck off.

2317
02:09:36,329 --> 02:09:40,270
You don't own the sidewalk, fuck off.

2318
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:52,520
Am I waiting for somebody?

2319
02:09:53,079 --> 02:09:55,920
Am I waiting for someone?

2320
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:00,439
It looked like she was waiting for somebody.

2321
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:04,199
I'm going to set off the fireworks.

2322
02:10:04,199 --> 02:10:06,359
Timing is everything with fireworks.

2323
02:10:06,359 --> 02:10:08,109
I had a great time today.

2324
02:10:11,369 --> 02:10:20,600
Um, uh, shit, I have to fill it.

2325
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:21,560
Please marry me.

2326
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:29,819
I'm giving you material to work with.

2327
02:10:32,859 --> 02:10:33,899
Uh, sure.

2328
02:10:33,899 --> 02:10:42,399
This is weird.

2329
02:10:42,399 --> 02:10:48,619
Are we dancing?

2330
02:10:48,619 --> 02:10:52,350
What am I doing?

2331
02:10:52,989 --> 02:10:56,649
This is something that like really has to pee.

2332
02:10:56,649 --> 02:10:58,329
I don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing.

2333
02:10:58,329 --> 02:11:04,430
Oh, all right.

2334
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:06,989
But let me, let me defend myself for the last thing I said.

2335
02:11:06,989 --> 02:11:14,279
So if you're taking up a whole sidewalk, like if you look, if you want to stop and,

2336
02:11:14,279 --> 02:11:14,920
oh, look at that.

2337
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:16,119
Let's look, we're sightseeing.

2338
02:11:16,119 --> 02:11:16,760
That's fine.

2339
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:17,239
That's great.

2340
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:21,149
But like, if you're not going to take a picture, right?

2341
02:11:21,149 --> 02:11:24,750
If you're not taking, oh, hey, let me get a good photo of that.

2342
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:25,550
Go over there.

2343
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:25,949
Oh, cool.

2344
02:11:25,949 --> 02:11:26,109
Yeah.

2345
02:11:26,109 --> 02:11:26,829
How about right here?

2346
02:11:26,829 --> 02:11:27,310
Right?

2347
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:30,619
You give people the space to like, okay, you can take a photo.

2348
02:11:30,619 --> 02:11:34,539
But if you're just sitting there standing in the middle of like, and blocking the whole way,

2349
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:38,140
there's nothing in my, nothing I can do to make you leave or make you move.

2350
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:38,859
Right?

2351
02:11:38,859 --> 02:11:40,460
So it's, it's, it's inconsiderate.

2352
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:42,909
That's very inconsiderate.

2353
02:11:42,909 --> 02:11:46,350
If you are with somebody and there's people behind you that are just walking,

2354
02:11:46,989 --> 02:11:48,590
you go, oh, that's really cool.

2355
02:11:48,909 --> 02:11:49,789
Come over here for a sec.

2356
02:11:49,789 --> 02:11:52,989
Like you step kind of on the edge and like, oh, yeah, yeah, cool.

2357
02:11:52,989 --> 02:11:53,149
Good.

2358
02:11:53,149 --> 02:11:55,069
People are just walking by one, two, three.

2359
02:11:55,069 --> 02:11:55,310
All right.

2360
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:58,270
We've got a gap of like this, like not a person for like another minute, two minutes.

2361
02:11:58,989 --> 02:12:02,189
Let's go back into the sidewalk and fucking look around.

2362
02:12:02,189 --> 02:12:03,069
There we are.

2363
02:12:03,069 --> 02:12:05,600
You got to be aware of people walking on the sidewalk.

2364
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:09,850
Otherwise you get a situation with someone.

2365
02:12:09,850 --> 02:12:10,810
You don't know what somebody has to be.

2366
02:12:12,439 --> 02:12:14,119
Throw the sword out, defend thyself.

2367
02:12:18,699 --> 02:12:19,819
Okay, Mr. David.

2368
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:29,199
There was an honest woodcutter.

2369
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:32,189
One day he dropped his precious axe in a lake.

2370
02:12:32,189 --> 02:12:34,909
A goddess then returned it to him or maybe not.

2371
02:12:35,310 --> 02:12:36,590
What kind of axe did you drop?

2372
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:38,750
A golden axe or a silver axe?

2373
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:40,239
Or was it this?

2374
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:45,680
I mean, this is, this is a lot.

2375
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:47,119
I can't lie to like a goddess.

2376
02:12:47,119 --> 02:12:47,600
They'll know.

2377
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:51,869
Now they give me the golden one because I was truthful.

2378
02:12:51,869 --> 02:12:54,909
That's how this works.

2379
02:12:54,909 --> 02:13:04,109
I'm going to sneeze.

2380
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:08,880
Okay.

2381
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:09,920
I don't know if I got it or not.

2382
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:10,399
I might have.

2383
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:17,079
Hopefully I got it.

2384
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:26,430
Train your brain.

2385
02:13:26,989 --> 02:13:28,720
What do you see?

2386
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:29,520
Answer in English.

2387
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:36,939
Apple.

2388
02:13:36,939 --> 02:13:50,399
Carrie.

2389
02:13:50,399 --> 02:13:52,479
I really like that lion having sex joke.

2390
02:13:53,119 --> 02:13:57,449
Okay.

2391
02:13:57,449 --> 02:13:58,729
I'm pregnant.

2392
02:13:58,729 --> 02:14:00,010
So I'm going to sit down.

2393
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:01,920
Oh, sit down.

2394
02:14:03,899 --> 02:14:04,300
Thank you.

2395
02:14:12,489 --> 02:14:13,529
Why are the animals in here?

2396
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:15,579
You.

2397
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:23,479
That was bizarre.

2398
02:14:23,479 --> 02:14:23,800
I don't know.

2399
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:27,399
Very vaguely considerate.

2400
02:14:27,399 --> 02:14:29,100
Down to the last five.

2401
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:39,899
What am I doing?

2402
02:14:39,899 --> 02:14:40,460
Whoa.

2403
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:40,779
Whoa.

2404
02:14:40,779 --> 02:14:41,020
What?

2405
02:14:41,659 --> 02:14:42,140
I don't get it.

2406
02:14:43,149 --> 02:14:43,949
Oh, shit.

2407
02:14:43,949 --> 02:14:44,270
Okay.

2408
02:14:44,829 --> 02:14:50,199
I think I have to get this all the way across.

2409
02:14:50,199 --> 02:15:03,239
All right.

2410
02:15:03,239 --> 02:15:03,880
Got it.

2411
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:06,699
Another one.

2412
02:15:06,699 --> 02:15:31,319
When should I wake?

2413
02:15:31,319 --> 02:15:32,039
Three?

2414
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:32,840
What time do I wake?

2415
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:33,880
I don't know when to wake it up.

2416
02:15:38,939 --> 02:15:43,149
Did I not have done that?

2417
02:15:43,149 --> 02:15:47,869
I don't know.

2418
02:15:47,869 --> 02:15:49,229
We're running like a schedule.

2419
02:15:49,229 --> 02:15:50,029
Okay.

2420
02:15:50,029 --> 02:15:50,989
We need a baby.

2421
02:15:50,989 --> 02:15:51,789
Everybody in the frame.

2422
02:15:51,789 --> 02:15:52,829
Everyone's looking.

2423
02:15:52,829 --> 02:15:53,399
Got it.

2424
02:15:53,399 --> 02:15:54,840
Well, you weren't that happy, but it's all right.

2425
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:56,359
At least we're all looking in the right direction.

2426
02:15:56,359 --> 02:16:02,270
You woke the baby up at 3 a.m.

2427
02:16:02,270 --> 02:16:07,949
Hey, you.

2428
02:16:07,949 --> 02:16:09,630
My, how the time flies.

2429
02:16:09,630 --> 02:16:14,779
You're already three.

2430
02:16:14,779 --> 02:16:21,949
It seems that my time as a mother will pass in a flash.

2431
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:27,789
Got nothing to say about this one.

2432
02:16:28,350 --> 02:16:32,750
I had a dream yesterday.

2433
02:16:33,389 --> 02:17:05,850
You say that's more like me.

2434
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:06,889
That might be so.

2435
02:17:06,889 --> 02:17:10,569
I wonder if one day this child will be considerate too.

2436
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:17,520
Nowadays, don't they say that being too considerate when it comes to others is a fault?

2437
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:23,709
Since everyone's different, you need to be considerate.

2438
02:17:23,709 --> 02:17:24,030
You have...

2439
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,079
Everybody, wait a minute.

2440
02:17:29,709 --> 02:17:32,239
He's going like...

2441
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:32,719
I'm so...

2442
02:17:32,719 --> 02:17:33,360
I was fucking...

2443
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:34,319
That was weird.

2444
02:17:34,319 --> 02:17:35,280
That was strange.

2445
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:40,170
That was...

2446
02:17:40,729 --> 02:17:41,129
I...

2447
02:17:41,129 --> 02:17:42,489
That was fucking weird.

2448
02:17:42,489 --> 02:17:44,270
With somebody's leg?

2449
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:49,479
Yeah, I know.

2450
02:17:49,479 --> 02:17:51,000
But like, it was fucking weird.

2451
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,040
It was a weird spot.

2452
02:17:52,969 --> 02:17:54,329
That was in a weird spot.

2453
02:17:54,329 --> 02:18:04,829
All right.

2454
02:18:04,829 --> 02:18:09,020
Turn the page.

2455
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:09,420
Dirty.

2456
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:10,059
Oh, no.

2457
02:18:10,059 --> 02:18:13,180
I'm just saying like it was fucking jarring for a second.

2458
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:13,739
I was just like...

2459
02:18:13,739 --> 02:18:15,979
So I thought it was like his arm down there.

2460
02:18:15,979 --> 02:18:17,100
But both of his arms are up here.

2461
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:18,379
And there was another arm like coming up here.

2462
02:18:18,379 --> 02:18:19,020
It was a leg.

2463
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:19,659
It was a knee.

2464
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:24,170
All right.

2465
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:25,690
Ban all conversations.

2466
02:18:25,850 --> 02:18:26,729
Ban all conversations.

2467
02:18:26,729 --> 02:18:28,010
Just lock it down right now.

2468
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:28,729
Lock it down right now.

2469
02:18:28,729 --> 02:18:29,450
Lock it down quick.

2470
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:30,889
Lock it down quick.

2471
02:18:30,889 --> 02:18:31,290
I've made...

2472
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:32,090
I've ruined it.

2473
02:18:32,090 --> 02:18:32,649
But...

2474
02:18:32,649 --> 02:18:33,370
Lock it down.

2475
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:34,409
Ban all conversations.

2476
02:18:34,969 --> 02:18:39,260
What do you mean?

2477
02:18:39,260 --> 02:19:00,989
Get over here.

2478
02:19:00,989 --> 02:19:01,709
How did we do?

2479
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:05,440
Not that great with timing.

2480
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:05,760
Okay.

2481
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:10,879
Generally considerate, a kind-hearted hot pot maestro.

2482
02:19:10,879 --> 02:19:19,629
I want to see the detailed...

2483
02:19:19,629 --> 02:19:20,510
I couldn't even read the...

2484
02:19:20,510 --> 02:19:21,149
I hit tab.

2485
02:19:21,149 --> 02:19:21,950
It didn't do anything.

2486
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:22,190
What?

2487
02:19:28,959 --> 02:19:29,360
Can I go...

2488
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:29,920
Okay, here we go.

2489
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:32,920
All right.

2490
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:33,239
Whoa.

2491
02:19:35,290 --> 02:19:37,290
Disappointing in group dynamics in this one.

2492
02:19:37,770 --> 02:19:42,430
The knowledge to understand the role others expect you to play in a group.

2493
02:19:43,069 --> 02:19:47,159
I think so.

2494
02:19:47,159 --> 02:19:47,879
What about interval?

2495
02:19:47,879 --> 02:19:48,760
Good and bad intervals?

2496
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:51,319
My spatial awareness is big.

2497
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:52,680
Shut it down.

2498
02:20:20,139 --> 02:20:23,420
Not five minutes ago.

2499
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:25,040
It was a scene.

2500
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,680
It was lying down like this.

2501
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:32,479
And there was a sensor bar down there covering me.

2502
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:41,129
It was like a sensor thing on him.

2503
02:20:41,129 --> 02:20:43,209
And then it was like, oh, here's another photo of like,

2504
02:20:43,209 --> 02:20:44,170
dad or whatever.

2505
02:20:44,170 --> 02:20:45,370
Like going like this.

2506
02:20:45,370 --> 02:20:45,690
And I'm...

2507
02:20:46,329 --> 02:20:50,829
I have defenses here.

2508
02:20:50,829 --> 02:20:51,469
I have a defense.

2509
02:21:06,239 --> 02:21:07,040
What's wrong with you?

2510
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:08,239
And nothing's wrong with me!

2511
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:13,659
All right, so that was considerate.

2512
02:21:14,379 --> 02:21:15,760
That was considerate.

2513
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:16,959
It was a really fun experience.

2514
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:22,780
I had a great time.

2515
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:24,200
There's nothing wrong with me.

2516
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:25,559
There's nothing wrong with me.

2517
02:21:25,559 --> 02:21:28,879
I'm going to get chopsticks to prove to you that I can use them.

2518
02:21:29,930 --> 02:21:32,170
And then we're going to go from there.

2519
02:21:32,170 --> 02:21:33,930
We're going to play the Roswell game.

2520
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:41,040
You failed every test.

2521
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:41,520
I did not.

2522
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:42,799
I got like a 70 on everything.

2523
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:46,540
We're going to take a three-minute break.

2524
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:47,340
I'm going to get some water.

2525
02:21:47,979 --> 02:21:48,540
I'm going to pee.

2526
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:52,700
And we'll just switch to Roswell Agent, whatever it's called.

2527
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:57,959
70 is a C.

2528
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,319
That's fine.

2529
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:01,120
I passed.

2530
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:02,159
All right, I'll be right back.

2531
02:22:02,159 --> 02:22:02,799
See you guys in a minute.

2532
02:22:02,799 --> 02:22:04,079
We're going to play the Alien game.

2533
02:22:04,079 --> 02:22:04,959
That was considerate.

2534
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:05,680
One, two, and three.

2535
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:06,479
That was very fun.

2536
02:22:06,479 --> 02:22:07,360
It was very engaging.

2537
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,000
I really liked it.

2538
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:08,719
I thought it was really fun.

2539
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:12,110
I think it's like 10 bucks for the whole series.

2540
02:22:12,989 --> 02:22:15,469
It might be like $12 for all three of those games.

2541
02:22:15,469 --> 02:22:19,469
So it's like, you know, get like a few hours of fun out of it.

2542
02:22:19,469 --> 02:22:20,510
Like 10 bucks.

2543
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:21,149
Yeah, it was fun.

2544
02:22:21,149 --> 02:22:22,989
See you in a minute.
