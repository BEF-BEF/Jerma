1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:08,519
Alright, unfortunately we're gonna have to pivot, because, uh, Beautiful Jo's not gonna work either, because this memory card is, is, is not, it's just like, toast.

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,019
Uh, alright, good, cool. So, I'm gonna have a new memory card, it'll work tomorrow.

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,019
Alright, so we're gonna pivot, we're gonna pivot.

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,519
I'm gonna use the same fucking console.

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,530
We're gonna pivot to the Wii.

6
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,239
It's time to pivot.

7
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:35,310
Oh, we're, we're pivoting.

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,310
To Rage Cooking Mama Cook-Off.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,369
That's a, that's a hard fucking rage pivot if I've ever seen one.

10
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:53,469
It's in a fucking disk.

11
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,469
Unbelievable.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,780
Ah.

13
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,659
I'm gonna be on cam for this one.

14
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,370
Me.

15
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,790
Imagine wanting Rain World over Cooking Mama?

16
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,540
I mean, they're both, they're both pretty interesting.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:32,319
Uh, so tomorrow, we're gonna, we're gonna do this again tomorrow.

18
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:42,319
I, I know, I know, I, I see that it takes 10 minutes for the SD card, but I don't know, I, I don't even know where an SD card is.

19
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:49,060
I have to go, like, look for where my SD cards, I, like, that, that's like a 30 to 40 minute experience.

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,560
It's not just, download two items, download, and it's done, done.

21
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,310
We're in the middle of a broadcast, I'm not gonna be like, ah, see you guys in like 30 minutes.

22
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,810
Or, like, I'll look for an SD card.

23
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,450
There's one somewhere in this house, and I don't know where it is.

24
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,159
Now, we're just gonna do it tomorrow.

25
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:15,979
In your Wii, I don't have an SD card in the Wii.

26
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,990
Alright, let's go.

27
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,129
Here, you know what, let's just do this.

28
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:25,129
Welcome to the stream.

29
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:26,129
Because we're starting over.

30
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:28,129
See you in a second.

31
00:02:28,629 --> 00:03:20,740
We're also gonna go on cam for this one.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,740
Because, you know, I have the Wiimotes and shit in my hand.

33
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,490
Hey, what's going on, how are you guys?

34
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:35,759
Just joining, we're, we're welcome, everybody, to the stream.

35
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,539
Hope you guys had a good, uh, couple of days here.

36
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,060
I've been alright, I've been okay.

37
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm pretty good.

38
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:55,379
I had a run in with, um, some flash memory over the last couple of days.

39
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,060
I want to take, um, I'm thinking about taking a hammer to something.

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,240
You know, just nothing too major.

41
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,240
Yeah, we'll get started.

42
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,530
We're gonna do Cooking Mama Cook Off.

43
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,530
Cooking Mama Cook Off.

44
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,530
That's what I've heard we're gonna do today.

45
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,290
Sounds good.

46
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,040
Alright, let me just make a tweet.

47
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,040
Delete the old tweet that I had.

48
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,040
I had something wrong with my iPhone like an hour and a half ago.

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,149
It said, it said, the chibi robo.

50
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:29,149
I didn't, I didn't write that.

51
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:30,149
I had something happen.

52
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,149
I got like a fucking virus or something.

53
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:33,149
Alright.

54
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,930
I'm so sad.

55
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,930
I like it, it worked too.

56
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,930
I'm hounded by a fucking ghost.

57
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,430
There's a ghost that follows me everywhere.

58
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,430
Like a technology ghost.

59
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,310
Alright, let's go.

60
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:05,399
Cooking Mama.

61
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:06,399
I'm ready.

62
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,399
I actually am excited for this one too.

63
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,899
I also have to change the title.

64
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,740
Because this doesn't make any sense.

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,740
The ultimate household, the ultimate household chef.

66
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,740
How does that sound?

67
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,740
The ultimate household chef?

68
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:33,980
I just have to change one word.

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,980
Cooking Mama.

70
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,360
How many Cooking Mamas are there?

71
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,360
There's like 30 of these games?

72
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,560
Alright, let's go.

73
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,850
That looked weird.

74
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,610
Alright, let's get a good view of me and my Wii.

75
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,000
I've got my Wiimote.

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
I've got my Nunchuck.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,750
Let me make this look better.

78
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,670
Okay.

79
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm ready.

80
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,350
Time to chop and cut and eat.

81
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,360
Why do I look so mad?

82
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:40,240
Well, an hour and 25 minutes went by of a game I wanted to play and my fucking GameCube memory card was corrupted.

83
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,240
I don't think it's sunshine and rainbows right now for me.

84
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,189
Yes, I do.

85
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,189
I would love to create a save file.

86
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,600
Watch this not work either.

87
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,180
Hey, by the way, no hand strap physically even on this Wiimote.

88
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,399
It's got a corrupted Wii.

89
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,279
I'm ready.

90
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:15,769
Should I go?

91
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:16,769
I should go like...

92
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:17,769
Can you guys see my hands?

93
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:18,769
Don't matter.

94
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,779
New game.

95
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,579
File 1.

96
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,579
New file.

97
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,579
Friends is...

98
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,579
Let's cook.

99
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,579
Alright, I don't know how to play.

100
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:33,579
I need to learn how to play.

101
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,579
You sweaty?

102
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,579
I'm not sweaty.

103
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,579
Let's cook.

104
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,620
Select recipe.

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,620
Okay, there's...

106
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,620
What is it?

107
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,620
Minestrone soup?

108
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,620
Is this game hard?

109
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,620
Beef and wine sauce.

110
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,620
Custard.

111
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,620
We're doing custard.

112
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,620
Okay, start.

113
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,649
I'm just...

114
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:02,649
I'm going off the grid.

115
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,649
I'm fucking deleting myself right now.

116
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:07,649
You can reach me through fucking carrier mail.

117
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,649
Alright, practice.

118
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:15,339
Swing the Wii remote in order to tap the eggs on the bowl.

119
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,339
When it cracks, press the A button to put the egg in the bowl.

120
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,220
Okay.

121
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,019
Add and use the clues to add the correct items to the bowl.

122
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,019
Point at the item and pick it up with the B button.

123
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,019
Follow the on-screen instructions to add items.

124
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,019
Okay.

125
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,019
Point the Wii remote down and turn it to stir.

126
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,259
Don't do too hard, it'll spill.

127
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,950
Twist the Wii remote right, left, to pour.

128
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:43,950
Okay.

129
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,950
Twist the Wii remote.

130
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,950
We're using a microwave, mama?

131
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:52,149
Game's too quiet?

132
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:53,149
What?

133
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,539
Game's too loud.

134
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,059
Don't think mama's using a microwave?

135
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,070
Alright, I got it.

136
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,070
Let's try it.

137
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,240
Got it!

138
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,490
I thought I was putting...

139
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,490
I thought I was cracking...

140
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,490
Ew!

141
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,490
I thought I was cracking eggs.

142
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,230
I thought I was supposed to be cracking eggs.

143
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,519
Oh, this is practice.

144
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:40,519
Okay.

145
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,519
It's each step.

146
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:43,519
I get it.

147
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,519
Alright, we'll do eggs.

148
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:48,289
Nah, I don't...

149
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,289
I'll practice, I'm good.

150
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,289
Let's go.

151
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:55,940
Swing the Wii remote in order to tap the egg on the bowl.

152
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,440
When it cracks, press A to put it...

153
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,440
Okay, here we go.

154
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,440
Ready?

155
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:20,299
What's wrong with that?

156
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,659
Oh, it's gonna be little.

157
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,980
It's gonna be small tap.

158
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,940
I got it.

159
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,940
Alright.

160
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,019
Done.

161
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,019
Better than mama.

162
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,019
Mama, you're doing not very good.

163
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,919
Alright, now it's gonna add ingredients.

164
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,919
Use the clues to add the correct items to the bowl.

165
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:57,919
Point at the item and pick it up with the B button.

166
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,919
Okay, follow the instructions.

167
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,179
Oh, shit.

168
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:02,679
Okay, I gotta pick up the...

169
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:03,679
Egg.

170
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:05,679
I don't know which one of these is egg.

171
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:06,679
What?

172
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,220
It's not egg?

173
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,570
Oh.

174
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,450
Okay, we're good.

175
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,269
I was asking for egg.

176
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:37,820
I gotta leave him for the coffee.

177
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,080
Alright, stir.

178
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,080
Point the Wii remote down and move it around quickly.

179
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,080
If you don't stir too hard, it'll spill.

180
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,179
That's going too fast.

181
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,179
Faster?

182
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,590
No, I don't want it to spill.

183
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,440
Okay, now put it into the mold.

184
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,440
Push the Wii remote...

185
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,440
Okay.

186
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,940
...right to four.

187
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,940
Put carefully to make sure it doesn't overflow.

188
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,940
Okay.

189
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,940
Careful.

190
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,940
Careful.

191
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:33,990
Is that good?

192
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,090
No!

193
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,090
It's okay.

194
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,090
We turned it into a muffin, mama.

195
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,090
It's okay.

196
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,750
Ooh.

197
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,899
How many do I have to do?

198
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,669
I want us a hundred points.

199
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:06,980
That's pretty good.

200
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,379
Not bad.

201
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,549
Good.

202
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,620
Alright, I'm almost done with it, right?

203
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:28,309
Alright, this is just twist the Wii remote while holding the A button to adjust the oven.

204
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,309
Watch the meter carefully.

205
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,309
When it reaches the red part, switch it off.

206
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,080
What?

207
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,080
I have to hold my finger on the oven?

208
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,440
Ten?

209
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,250
Fifteen?

210
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,940
Twenty?

211
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,309
How hot does this have to be?

212
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,639
That's good.

213
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,639
I didn't even cook them.

214
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:58,210
Alright.

215
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,210
Now this is just throw it out of the mold.

216
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,210
I remember.

217
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,210
Don't shake it too hard.

218
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:09,659
Okay.

219
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:10,659
Good job.

220
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,659
That was close.

221
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,610
That's good.

222
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:31,590
Did I get good on the whole thing?

223
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,080
Now do I have to eat it with my hands?

224
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:40,559
Eat it.

225
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:41,559
Alright.

226
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:42,559
Results.

227
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:43,559
Very good.

228
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:44,559
Good.

229
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:45,559
Try harder.

230
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,470
Try harder.

231
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,899
Did I lose?

232
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,679
I got a new recipe.

233
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,679
Oh, a fucking grilled cheese sliders!

234
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:04,149
Alright.

235
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:05,149
I want like a...

236
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,149
I don't want just like a piece of custard.

237
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,149
Let's do soup.

238
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:10,149
Finish from.

239
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,559
Hold the Wii remote upright.

240
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:15,559
Yeah, alright.

241
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:16,559
Upright and moving forward and backward.

242
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,559
This is to open the can.

243
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,059
Press A button when the meter gets to the yellow portion to open the lid.

244
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,240
That's good.

245
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,059
Why is it coming out of a...

246
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,059
Mama, you're using a toaster oven.

247
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,059
You're getting soup out of a can.

248
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,340
Alright.

249
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,340
Move it so we can peel the potatoes.

250
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,539
Move it from the top to the bottom to peel the skin.

251
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,539
Okay.

252
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:15,899
Not efficient.

253
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,080
Very inefficient.

254
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:33,720
Alright, it's done.

255
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,720
It's done.

256
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,379
This is where Mom doesn't ask you to do this again.

257
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:58,279
This is where you peel the carrot to a point where there's like a toothpick worth of carrot.

258
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,970
It just turns into this like skinny little shitty thing.

259
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,970
Because you peeled off the skin and you peeled off all the actual vegetable.

260
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:16,609
Oh, you did it better than Mama!

261
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,619
See that?

262
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,250
Alright, finely chop.

263
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,250
First, trace the arrow with the...

264
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,490
I spit all over my mouth.

265
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,990
Trace the arrow with the Wiimote to cut the ingredients when they are cut.

266
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,990
Shake the Wiimote up and down to finely chop them.

267
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:35,990
So I go...

268
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:36,990
Boink!

269
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:37,990
And then...

270
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:12,250
Onion!

271
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,630
Green bean!

272
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,180
Very good.

273
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,079
Move the Wiimote forward and backward to cut the...

274
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,079
More cutting.

275
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:45,990
More cutting.

276
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:46,990
Okay, I can do this.

277
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:47,990
I'm pretty good at the cutting.

278
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:48,990
Bacon.

279
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,710
This is a lot of bacon.

280
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,720
This is like a whole loaf of ham.

281
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,009
Stir fry.

282
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:06,009
This is...

283
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,009
Alright.

284
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:10,009
To add to the pan, select the icons with the A button.

285
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:13,009
Move the Wiimote toward and away from you to prevent burning.

286
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:15,640
When the...

287
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,640
When two circles appear, press finished.

288
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,069
We're just like...

289
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:21,069
We just...

290
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,069
This is how you pretend to be a chef.

291
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,069
Do you ever want someone to think that you're interesting?

292
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,069
Let's say you have a date and somebody's like,

293
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,069
Oh, but you can cook!

294
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,069
You're like, I can cook.

295
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,069
I can cook.

296
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:32,069
Just period.

297
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:33,069
Listen to me.

298
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:34,069
Put spinach.

299
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:34,569
Put spinach.

300
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:35,569
A little bit of spinach in a pan.

301
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,569
A little bit of like olive oil.

302
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:38,569
And just like...

303
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:41,569
While they're in the room with you.

304
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:45,019
It'll work every time.

305
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,019
Put like some green beans, some bell peppers, some onions.

306
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,019
And like a little bit of other water-based vegetables.

307
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:55,019
And just shake it like, yeah, I know what I'm doing.

308
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,019
This is the I pretend to know how to fucking cook stream.

309
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,019
I don't know why I'm streaming this, but you know.

310
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:06,529
And then make something up while they have to leave.

311
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:10,690
Alright, let's put the bacon in.

312
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,690
Onions.

313
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:12,690
Green beans.

314
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,690
Carrots.

315
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,690
Potatoes.

316
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,690
Doesn't even matter.

317
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,829
Let's just do this.

318
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:19,829
Looks pretty good.

319
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:20,829
Just put it all in the pan.

320
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:21,829
Carrots.

321
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,900
Okay, take it out.

322
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,990
What was wrong with that?

323
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,990
What was wrong with that?

324
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,180
Underdone?

325
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,180
I didn't finish it?

326
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,180
What was undercooked?

327
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,180
What?

328
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:43,569
Stew.

329
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:44,569
Stir.

330
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:45,569
Rotate the Wii mode.

331
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,569
You put everything in at the same time?

332
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:49,569
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

333
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:51,569
That's how you impress your date.

334
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:55,369
Everything just goes into this and it makes like a...

335
00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:00,700
And then they just think that you know what you're doing.

336
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,029
Rotate the Wii remote.

337
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,029
Add.

338
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,029
Point to the icon and press the A button to add.

339
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:07,029
Adjust the heat.

340
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:08,029
Twist the remote.

341
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:09,029
Adjust the heat.

342
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:10,029
We're just stewing it now.

343
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:16,619
Add what?

344
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:17,619
Add?

345
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:18,799
Add salt.

346
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:22,359
Medium.

347
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,000
Stir it.

348
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,000
A little bit of salt in there.

349
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't know.

350
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,000
Pepper.

351
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,000
Heat on high.

352
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,500
What do I put in the corn?

353
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,779
Put in a can of tomatoes?

354
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:37,779
Add wheat.

355
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:39,779
All right.

356
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:44,859
Green beans are in.

357
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:45,859
Stir it up.

358
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:46,859
Looks good.

359
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:52,650
Not bad.

360
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,650
Not bad.

361
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,890
I did it.

362
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,180
And then your date, you present this to them.

363
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,119
And they go...

364
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,119
And by the way, use a shitload of time.

365
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:14,119
But like, it doesn't even matter if the recipe calls for it.

366
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:15,119
Put like...

367
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:17,119
Half the bottle of the spice.

368
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:18,119
Half the spice bottle of time.

369
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:19,119
Half the bottle of time.

370
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:20,119
Half the bottle of time.

371
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:21,119
Half the bottle of time.

372
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:22,119
Half the bottle of time.

373
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:23,119
Half the bottle of time.

374
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:24,119
Like into the soup.

375
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:27,119
It just will smell like, oh, what an aroma.

376
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:30,119
And when you bring it, it'll fill the house with this thyme smell.

377
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,119
And it's like, holy shit, this person, look at this.

378
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,119
It smells delicious in here.

379
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,119
Just make sure they don't eat it.

380
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:39,829
Like...

381
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:41,829
Make a phone call.

382
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:43,519
Oh, what's the...

383
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:44,519
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,519
What, you want to meet us at...

385
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:47,519
Fucking...

386
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:49,759
21 Beef?

387
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:50,759
Or whatever the restaurant is?

388
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:51,759
Oh, yeah, sure.

389
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:52,759
And then you fucking hang up.

390
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:53,759
Hey, don't...

391
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,259
Don't...

392
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,259
We got a big dinner with some friends.

393
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,259
And then you go in there and you just pretend that you got fucking blown off by your friends.

394
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,259
And enjoy a nice dinner with your date.

395
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:11,920
Yeah, they have like 21 different steaks.

396
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:12,920
I don't know.

397
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,279
Web of life.

398
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:21,329
Wait, I didn't do the...

399
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:22,329
The flan?

400
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:23,329
Oh, I gotta...

401
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:25,329
Okay, I gotta try harder on this one.

402
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:33,910
Oh, honey, that looks...

403
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,910
Why would your first date be calling you honey?

404
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,430
Shit.

405
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,230
There we go.

406
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,230
Little life.

407
00:23:45,730 --> 00:24:00,420
Fuck.

408
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,420
Egg sucker.

409
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,039
You want to know something funny about me and my life?

410
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:05,039
I...

411
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:06,039
I can't eat.

412
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:07,039
I don't...

413
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:08,039
I don't do egg.

414
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:09,039
I don't know how to do them.

415
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,039
I don't know how to open them.

416
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,670
Every time I try it, it just goes like...

417
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,670
It gets all over my hands and shit.

418
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:17,670
I don't...

419
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,670
I don't do...

420
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,670
I don't crack eggs.

421
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:20,670
I don't do it.

422
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,490
Alright, same deal.

423
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,490
Add the ingredients.

424
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,160
Egg.

425
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,480
Going in.

426
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,039
What's that?

427
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:38,039
Liquor.

428
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,529
Milk.

429
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,369
Instantly done.

430
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:43,369
Good.

431
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:44,369
That's easy.

432
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,700
Even better than mama.

433
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,299
I'm gonna do this wicked fast, but not that fast.

434
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,299
Ready?

435
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,670
Oh, nobody does this better than me.

436
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:55,579
Can I take...

437
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:56,579
Can I have it come up faster?

438
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:04,339
No bonus?

439
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,339
That's bullshit.

440
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,640
Bake it in the oven.

441
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,640
Now this...

442
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,640
Okay, twist the remote while holding A to adjust the oven.

443
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,640
Watch the meter carefully.

444
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,140
Turn off the oven when it...

445
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,140
Okay, so turn...

446
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,140
I gotta turn it on.

447
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:31,119
I got it.

448
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:36,769
I had to have made up for it, right?

449
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:38,769
That was when I just make them come out carefully.

450
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:43,869
That was gentle.

451
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,720
Fuck you!

452
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,720
Why?

453
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:12,799
I got it, right?

454
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,880
Try harder?

455
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,380
No, I got it.

456
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,380
This is...

457
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,380
I got a bronze medal.

458
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,049
I got it.

459
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,049
No, I got it.

460
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:33,230
Okay.

461
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,660
This is...

462
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,660
Mochi.

463
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,660
Let's do it.

464
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Okay, add water.

465
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,180
Turn the water...

466
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,180
Turn on the water and fill the pot.

467
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,180
Tilt the remote upward to stop the water before it overflows.

468
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,250
Oh, I only get one shot.

469
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,500
I only get one shot.

470
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,630
Why am I apologizing?

471
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
Why am I apologizing?

472
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,180
What did I do?

473
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:18,109
Point the remote down and hold it upright.

474
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,109
This...

475
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,339
How long did it take this time?

476
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,339
An hour?

477
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,339
Forty minutes?

478
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,740
Swearing.

479
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,390
Okay.

480
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,890
Point the remote down and hold it upright.

481
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,890
Move it around quickly to wash.

482
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,890
When done, tilt the remote to drain the water.

483
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:39,890
So you go...

484
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,390
And then like this.

485
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,299
Say sorry to Mama.

486
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,799
Mama's not a real person.

487
00:28:48,799 --> 00:29:00,259
What? Did I just knock it over?

488
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:04,549
I just...

489
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,049
I just washed everything.

490
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,049
And just dumped it onto the counter.

491
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:17,009
Go back, go back.

492
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:18,009
No, no.

493
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:21,299
I want to make Mochi.

494
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:24,309
Okay.

495
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:39,690
I hate Mama.

496
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,690
No.

497
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,690
I just said fuck.

498
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,690
I said like fuck you game.

499
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,339
This is not...

500
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,339
I don't have to apologize to somebody that...

501
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,339
No, I'm not apologizing to anything on the Wii right now.

502
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,339
I'm very upset with the Wii right now.

503
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,839
And the GameCube memory card in particular.

504
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,160
Go around quickly to wash.

505
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,160
Then tilt the Wii remote to drain the water.

506
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:09,069
Isn't that what I did?

507
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,450
Okay, A.

508
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,450
Now tilt.

509
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,789
What the fuck is going on there?

510
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:27,720
I'm just going a little...

511
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,180
Hold A.

512
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:37,619
Watch the meter carefully.

513
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,119
When the barbeque gets to red, switch it off.

514
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:50,950
Fucking simple.

515
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,119
Floor Mochi.

516
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,339
Alright, pound the Mochi.

517
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,339
Move the Wii remote up and down to pound the rice.

518
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,339
Take care not to accidentally...

519
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,339
Hit your hand.

520
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:11,519
There's no hand.

521
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:16,609
Mama, I'm sorry.

522
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,430
Mama's going to have fucking bruises all over her.

523
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,029
I've tried to do twice before.

524
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,279
You gotta go to the darkness office like this.

525
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,279
I'm covered in fucking wilt and fucking bruises and shit.

526
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:11,779
Oh, this is so bad.

527
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:18,950
I'll get this one next time.

528
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,009
I need to practice.

529
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:26,029
Hold the Wii remote upright and move it left and right.

530
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:31,529
If it gets hard to grate, move the Wii remote up and down to shake the loose ingredients.

531
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:33,029
I gotta grate the cheese?

532
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:34,029
This cheese?

533
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,170
Get off!

534
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,410
This is shitload of cheese, Mama!

535
00:32:57,829 --> 00:32:59,329
Mama, what are you doing?

536
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:01,329
Why is there so much cheese on this?

537
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:12,109
You know what I do whenever I'm cooking with a great bunch of cheese like that?

538
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:14,609
I get a little overwhelmed.

539
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:22,609
And I just grab the whole mound, the soft, mushy, stick-together mound of Parmesan cheese, and I just eat the whole fucking thing.

540
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:24,109
And then I have to do it again.

541
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:28,369
Follow the on-screen...

542
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,369
Okay, make some Mochi.

543
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:35,180
So just follow the on-screen action.

544
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,680
So it's like left and right, tilt, turn.

545
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,740
Okay.

546
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Put it into the flour.

547
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,740
Roll it back and forth a couple times.

548
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,740
Get it dusted.

549
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
Into the chocolate.

550
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,539
Into the chocolate.

551
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,539
Soak it up.

552
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,720
Good.

553
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,410
Wrap it up.

554
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,630
Wrap it up.

555
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,320
One more.

556
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,820
Come on, hurry up.

557
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:17,349
Done.

558
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:26,539
Chocolate and cheese.

559
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,039
Well, it has to look like whatever.

560
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:29,539
Well, I don't even know what it was.

561
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:30,909
Complete.

562
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:31,909
All right.

563
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,699
Mochi.

564
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,769
I'm probably going to have to do this again.

565
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,679
Bronze.

566
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,179
Sorry.

567
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:45,679
I still completed it.

568
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,460
Three cookies.

569
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,460
You have a new recipe.

570
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:52,960
I don't know what that is.

571
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
I'm looking forward to it though.

572
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,300
Should I do the scrambled eggs?

573
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,300
I knew it.

574
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,800
See?

575
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Oh, I thought it was scrambled eggs.

576
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
It's scrambled eggs.

577
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,800
I make a brutally good scrambled egg.

578
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,300
What I do is I panic.

579
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,300
When I get the eggs into the pan,

580
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
and I freak out because I don't want to undo them,

581
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
and I end up overdoing them by about five straight minutes.

582
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,800
But they're like brown all over.

583
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,800
So, I make a pretty mean scrambled egg.

584
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,800
Okay.

585
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Swing the Wiimote in order to tap the egg on the bowl.

586
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:26,519
Is it good?

587
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,130
All right.

588
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:08,630
Open the can.

589
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,130
I need to do a test here.

590
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,630
Hold on.

591
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:17,780
It's a way off.

592
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,929
All right.

593
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:20,429
Hold on.

594
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:20,929
Ready?

595
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,429
Oh!

596
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:55,840
Hold on.

597
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,340
Wait, wait, wait.

598
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,840
Hold on.

599
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,340
I got it.

600
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:18,010
Right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye, left eye.

601
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,079
Good, right?

602
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,159
Better?

603
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:30,059
It's better.

604
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:36,019
It might take a little bit more moving around.

605
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:46,780
You need a psychiatrist.

606
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,099
You're trying to sync my gameplay to my webcam?

607
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,840
All right.

608
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,340
Scramble the eggs.

609
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,630
What the hell is that?

610
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,320
Egg?

611
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:10,059
Why is it doing like this weird mystery thing?

612
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,079
Cream cheese.

613
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:16,079
I don't know what the fuck cream cheese looks like in this game.

614
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:17,579
Milk.

615
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,480
How's that not milk?

616
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:28,309
All right.

617
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:29,309
Now in goes the prosciutto.

618
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,800
All right.

619
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:40,980
Grab.

620
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,480
All right, guys.

621
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Do the wing.

622
00:38:43,480 --> 00:39:35,159
Down.

623
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:35,659
Down.

624
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:36,159
Down.

625
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:36,659
Down.

626
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:37,159
Down.

627
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:37,659
Down.

628
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,659
I think we're good.

629
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,039
Spread the butter.

630
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:46,360
Build the Wii mode carefully to coat the frying pan with butter.

631
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,530
It's gonna stick right there.

632
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,530
Gotta get it all before the time runs out.

633
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,030
Got it.

634
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,449
Let's go read a bunch of books.

635
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:11,949
Good idea.

636
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:15,519
Increase your smarts.

637
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:17,659
All right.

638
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:18,159
Cook eggs.

639
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:19,159
Shake.

640
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,159
Shake the Wii mode.

641
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:21,960
Ack and forth.

642
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,960
Hold Wii mode upright.

643
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,760
And turn it around while holding B button.

644
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,260
Season.

645
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,760
Shake Wii mode while holding A button.

646
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,260
Okay.

647
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Let's cook these eggs.

648
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,650
Not too much.

649
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:55,190
All right.

650
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,690
They're done.

651
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,190
They're done.

652
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:56,690
They're done.

653
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,190
They're done.

654
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,690
They're done.

655
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,570
Mama, too much salt.

656
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:10,119
Looks like vomit.

657
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,940
Mama.

658
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,440
Mama.

659
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:13,940
Sodium.

660
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
Mama, too much sodium.

661
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:22,059
I don't like salty eggs.

662
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:24,250
I'd rather take...

663
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,250
Instead of putting a bunch of salt on eggs,

664
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:26,750
I'd like to do...

665
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,750
Just a little dollop of tabasco...

666
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,750
I was gonna say tabascio.

667
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,750
Like pistachio.

668
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,750
Tabasco sauce.

669
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,750
Just like...

670
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:37,920
And then you just like...

671
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:38,920
Let it get in there.

672
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,820
Tabasco.

673
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,820
Tabasco.

674
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,820
It's a...

675
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,380
New?

676
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:55,880
What's this?

677
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Beef and wine sauce.

678
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:58,880
Ooh.

679
00:41:59,380 --> 00:41:59,880
I like it.

680
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:02,960
Okay.

681
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Trace the arrow with the Wii mode to cut the ingredients.

682
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,639
This one...

683
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,139
This is elaborate.

684
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:07,639
This one's a lot.

685
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:09,809
All right.

686
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:10,309
I gotta get a good score here.

687
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,480
Beef rib.

688
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,210
Geo physics?

689
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:41,489
I love a good wine.

690
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,300
All right.

691
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:43,800
We gotta peel.

692
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
I was bad at this before.

693
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:06,619
One fluid motion.

694
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,599
It hurts my ADHD so bad.

695
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,599
You know what I mean?

696
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:29,389
It's hard.

697
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:29,889
I fuck.

698
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:30,889
This hurts my ADHD.

699
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:31,889
Like it hurts my whole body.

700
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:36,059
Yeah.

701
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,059
Some of you guys know what I'm talking about.

702
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:40,880
All right.

703
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,380
Mince the beef.

704
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:42,880
Shake the Wii mode.

705
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,380
Up and down.

706
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,380
Chop the ingredients.

707
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:44,880
That's it.

708
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
So just chop.

709
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:04,510
The shallots.

710
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,639
That looks like a banana.

711
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:11,639
Get the mushrooms in there.

712
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:12,639
Come.

713
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:20,219
Okay.

714
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:22,719
Use the clues to add the correct items to the bowl.

715
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:23,219
This one.

716
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:24,219
You have to guess.

717
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:26,599
Point at the item.

718
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:27,599
Pick it up with the B button.

719
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:36,719
Okay.

720
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:38,400
Pepper.

721
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,900
Then...

722
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,400
What's that?

723
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,400
Gravy.

724
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,840
And then...

725
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,340
The vegetables.

726
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
And then a little bit of this.

727
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,340
There it is.

728
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:48,840
Garnish.

729
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:49,840
Is that thyme?

730
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:03,980
Is it a coincidence that the Blade and Sorcerer video went up on YouTube the day you played Cooking Mama and you made a Cooking Mama joke in this video?

731
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,650
Yeah.

732
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:09,150
I think so.

733
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,150
Sprinkle.

734
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,849
Poke the ingredients.

735
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:15,849
Press A and the B button at the same time to sprinkle.

736
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:23,909
But I didn't...

737
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:27,329
Is that too much?

738
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:38,510
I don't know what I'm seasoning it with.

739
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,510
I'm just dumping shit on it.

740
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:48,309
I think that's alright.

741
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,380
Why is she so...

742
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:51,880
Wait, she...

743
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,880
She's so great.

744
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:54,880
Why...

745
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,380
What's going on?

746
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,010
Alright.

747
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:58,510
Spread the butter.

748
00:45:58,510 --> 00:45:59,010
Alright.

749
00:45:59,010 --> 00:45:59,510
Coat the butter in the pan.

750
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,010
I know this one.

751
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:03,750
Around the edges first.

752
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,420
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun!

753
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,659
Okay.

754
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:25,159
Stir fry.

755
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:29,309
Let's go.

756
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:29,809
Get it all in there.

757
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:32,429
Alright.

758
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:32,929
What cooks the longest?

759
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:33,929
Put the beef in first.

760
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:40,449
And then the mushrooms.

761
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:45,769
And then put the rest in.

762
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:07,949
It's charred.

763
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:09,449
It's charred, mate.

764
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:09,949
It's charred.

765
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:10,449
That's what I'm saying.

766
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:12,190
Alright.

767
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,190
Rotate the Wii mode.

768
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,690
Add.

769
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,190
Okay.

770
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,690
This is the stew part.

771
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:18,199
Put it all in the stew.

772
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:20,570
Add.

773
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,070
Salt.

774
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:23,630
Medium heat.

775
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,820
On medium.

776
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,630
Stir it up.

777
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,309
Add a little bit of whatever the fuck this is.

778
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:37,309
Put it on high.

779
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:41,650
Put a little bit of whatever this is with it.

780
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,650
A tied up thing.

781
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,900
Stir it up.

782
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,010
Put it on low.

783
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,010
Perfectly done.

784
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,320
Perfectly done.

785
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,179
How's it look?

786
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:03,420
Pretty good.

787
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,110
I don't like a chunky potato stew, though.

788
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:09,610
I like my potatoes to be...

789
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:10,610
Cubed.

790
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,119
If I do not have cubed potatoes,

791
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:16,119
I don't like it.

792
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:17,619
And they have to be...

793
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,119
Less than a half inch thick and a half inch wide.

794
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:20,619
You know what I'm saying?

795
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:22,119
I want cubed potatoes.

796
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:24,619
Big chunky potatoes don't do it for me.

797
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,260
The beef has to be also...

798
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,260
A cube-like shape.

799
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,260
I don't like big stringy long...

800
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,260
Pull.

801
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,760
Pull.

802
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,260
I gotta pull it.

803
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:39,760
No, no, no.

804
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,260
No.

805
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,260
It's gotta be cubed.

806
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Small cubed up meat.

807
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:53,480
All carrots...

808
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,480
Must be a perfect small circle in diameter like this.

809
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,480
Like very small.

810
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,280
And they have to be less than a half inch thick.

811
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,460
Alright, we can move on to this.

812
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:12,960
Next one.

813
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,460
Ooh, shrimp and chili sauce.

814
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:17,820
Kurogi.

815
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,820
Popcorn of the United States.

816
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,820
Ooh, what do we have?

817
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,820
Oh, we have lots of great Italian and French cuisine.

818
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,820
Minestrone.

819
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Oh, this is Japanese.

820
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,820
Mochi.

821
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:29,820
Oh, France.

822
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,820
Scrambled eggs.

823
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:31,820
What do I have from America?

824
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:33,820
Popcorn.

825
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:41,059
This is one step.

826
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:54,369
I love making popcorn on the stove though.

827
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:55,369
It is actually really good.

828
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,800
You gotta be careful though because you might put too much in

829
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,300
and that's when the lid starts to go up

830
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,800
and you start to make too much.

831
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,800
You start to freak out.

832
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,000
Look at this American cuisine.

833
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:18,199
Gotta keep it in the yellow.

834
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:18,699
That's it.

835
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:21,019
It's not burning.

836
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:21,519
It's fine.

837
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,869
Ah, classic American cuisine.

838
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:44,739
Add seasoning.

839
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,420
Why is it an open, like, salami sandwich?

840
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,920
When the bottle blinks, shake the Wiimote.

841
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920
Shake with good timing.

842
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,420
When the bottle blinks?

843
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,179
What?

844
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:05,179
What's going on?

845
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:07,179
When the bottle blinks?

846
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:08,679
No bottle is blinking.

847
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:10,679
What do you mean the bottle blinks?

848
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:18,599
Who's putting the salt on?

849
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:23,539
That's not blink.

850
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,039
That's not blinking, by the way.

851
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:27,539
That is just growth.

852
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:29,039
That's growing and shrinking.

853
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:30,539
That's not a blink.

854
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,460
Just like a typical American dish.

855
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,460
It's loaded with as much salt as you can physically fucking tolerate.

856
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:51,710
There's no wink, liars.

857
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:02,590
You're a great chef.

858
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,590
Hey, thanks.

859
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,829
Oh, another classic American dish.

860
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:11,329
The hot dog.

861
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:16,909
Why is classic American food food for toddlers?

862
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,860
The classic American.

863
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
Hot dog.

864
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,360
Chopped up a bunch.

865
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:25,219
Popcorn.

866
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:27,219
Macaroni and cheese.

867
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:34,579
Look, we're going to get another thing with an American flag that's like Cheerios.

868
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:37,829
And you just have to pick them up like a baby.

869
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:41,329
Just eat them one by one on one of those toddler dishes.

870
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:45,539
What's a classic American food?

871
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:51,280
What's a classic American dish?

872
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,780
American.

873
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,760
Apple pie.

874
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,760
Pies, yeah.

875
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
Desserts.

876
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,079
Burger.

877
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:02,079
I don't know about a burger.

878
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,579
Isn't burger German?

879
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:05,210
Hamburger.

880
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,210
That's like, that's German, right?

881
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,210
What's an American cuisine?

882
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,210
Barbecue, yep.

883
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,769
Barbecue is, yeah, absolutely.

884
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,550
Turkey.

885
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:22,550
Turkey, barbecue.

886
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:27,989
Diner food.

887
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:29,989
But that's not like, that's not like...

888
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:37,300
Diner food is just a place, that's like a genre of restaurant style.

889
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,300
That's not like classic American recipe.

890
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,300
Diner.

891
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,300
KFC.

892
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,300
Yeah, I guess so.

893
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,659
Beer.

894
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,250
Anything fried?

895
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:51,679
Like fried chicken.

896
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:56,559
Yeah, but hopefully we get some, hopefully we get like a...

897
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:00,849
Beer is German.

898
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:03,409
Germany didn't invent beer.

899
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:05,409
Who invented beer?

900
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,460
The Mesopotamians.

901
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,460
The Mesopotamians invented beer.

902
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:33,500
Sorry.

903
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,500
Vegan?

904
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,739
Alright, what's this?

905
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:36,739
Spaghetti and squid ink.

906
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:51,340
Eggs.

907
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,340
I fucking can't do the eggs.

908
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,340
Even in fucking fake life.

909
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,750
Light, light, light, light.

910
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:14,500
At the same speed, man.

911
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:18,510
Eggcellent, I get it.

912
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,260
NA doesn't have much distinct because it's all brought from other countries.

913
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,260
Yeah.

914
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,260
But, I mean like barbecue, like a smoked barbecue brisket.

915
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,260
That's pretty American.

916
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:40,340
No it isn't.

917
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,340
What are you talking about?

918
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:48,139
If you get smoked barbecue brisket from America, it's going to be better than anywhere else on Earth.

919
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:50,139
That's a fact.

920
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,210
Literally any chef on Earth will tell you that.

921
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,840
Some of the best chefs in the world will tell you that the best barbecue is in America.

922
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,840
Of course it is.

923
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,590
What country does barbecue better than America?

924
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:09,590
I'm sorry.

925
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,590
Like we're like, oh America is popcorn!

926
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:13,590
But I'm going to defend America when I need to.

927
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:19,219
Like fucking barbecue, American barbecue is better than anywhere else on the planet.

928
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:20,219
Like what are you talking about?

929
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:21,219
Come on.

930
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:24,030
He's a patriot.

931
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,460
I like eating smoked meat.

932
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,900
I need the dough.

933
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,760
We have the best burgers?

934
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,019
America's got some really good food.

935
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:06,519
I mean, yes, you could eat like chicken tenders and like pizza hut every day.

936
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:08,519
But like, I mean that's like the joke, right?

937
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,519
Like Americans, they eat fucking the pizza hut hot dogs and mac and cheese.

938
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:13,519
I mean they do.

939
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:14,519
We do.

940
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:25,489
I do.

941
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:26,489
How long does this need to be?

942
00:57:26,489 --> 00:57:27,489
How long does this need to be?

943
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:32,539
Is it too long?

944
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:34,550
What was I making?

945
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,139
What was that?

946
00:57:38,139 --> 00:57:39,139
I don't even know what that was.

947
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Oh, it's supposed to be spaghetti.

948
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,900
That would be one giant tube of spaghetti.

949
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,079
Okay.

950
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:54,079
Make some pasta.

951
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,079
When the pasta is flowing from the pasta machine, it reaches the length of the line.

952
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:01,079
Shake the Wiimote to cut the pasta.

953
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,079
Alright, so cut it when it gets...

954
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:18,019
This looks like fun.

955
00:58:18,019 --> 00:58:19,019
This looks like fun.

956
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:20,019
Is this hard to do?

957
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,730
Alright, you know why I want to make my own pasta?

958
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,730
Because you guys remember the Play-Doh play set?

959
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,730
Where you did the same exact thing except it wasn't pasta.

960
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:29,730
It was Play-Doh.

961
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,730
But it wasn't supposed to be pasta.

962
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:35,730
You just smooshed Play-Doh through a machine that turned it into this for no reason.

963
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,730
That's why I want to make this.

964
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,519
Childhood.

965
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:50,639
Inspiration.

966
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:52,639
You grew up at Toys R Us.

967
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:54,639
A lot of people did.

968
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:56,639
Alright, rotate the Wiimote so we're going to stew this again.

969
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:58,639
I've had some experience stewing.

970
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:07,619
A little bit of salt.

971
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:15,599
Get that heat up.

972
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:16,599
More stirring.

973
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:19,349
This is just really easy Guitar Hero.

974
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,099
Stir the pasta.

975
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,099
Damn it, I did.

976
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:28,719
Wonderful.

977
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:29,719
Better than mama.

978
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:32,789
It had really good...

979
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:33,789
Wait, what?

980
00:59:33,789 --> 00:59:34,789
What was mushy and gross?

981
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:36,789
Alright, drain the pasta.

982
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:38,789
The whole like this.

983
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:40,789
Tilt the pot to drain.

984
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:44,789
If you tilt too much, it'll spill and you'll like burn mama's hands again.

985
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:53,690
Good job.

986
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:59,579
That was it?

987
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:01,579
That's all the pasta that was in the fucking bowl?

988
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:03,579
What?

989
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:04,579
What?

990
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,070
Get your hand in there and like get it out.

991
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:15,500
Prepare.

992
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,989
Move the Wiimote in the direction of the arrow.

993
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:19,989
Prepare the ingredients.

994
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:43,079
Ugh!

995
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:44,079
It just ripped his head off.

996
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,079
Wonderful.

997
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,079
I'm sorry.

998
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:50,079
Anything that has a slimy outside...

999
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,079
I would not ever eat.

1000
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,079
I know, I'm sorry.

1001
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,079
Octopus get disgusting.

1002
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,079
Squid disgusting.

1003
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,079
They're like slimy, tendril aliens?

1004
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,079
No.

1005
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:04,079
Never.

1006
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,079
I'm sorry.

1007
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,079
I...

1008
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:09,730
Why would we eat that?

1009
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:14,269
It's squid.

1010
01:01:14,269 --> 01:01:15,269
It's octopus.

1011
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:16,269
No.

1012
01:01:16,269 --> 01:01:17,269
No.

1013
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:18,269
And their legs...

1014
01:01:18,269 --> 01:01:19,269
They have...

1015
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:23,269
You eat like octopus legs, they have like the suction cups and they're long and they like...

1016
01:01:24,269 --> 01:01:27,269
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, never.

1017
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:31,050
Ugh!

1018
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:35,940
I just like imagine it like...

1019
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,940
Like sucking in my lip and maybe like...

1020
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,940
It's on my lip!

1021
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,940
It's on my fucking lip!

1022
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,940
And like Cam has to reach over and like...

1023
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:43,940
Pull it off!

1024
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,940
I can't get it off!

1025
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,940
Ugh, no.

1026
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,139
I don't want it.

1027
01:01:49,139 --> 01:02:03,110
I don't want it.

1028
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:05,110
Why is the squid turned into onion rings when you cut it up?

1029
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,110
No, that's gross.

1030
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:07,110
Weird.

1031
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,110
Squid when you...

1032
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:12,110
It's just like little weird slimy wristbands.

1033
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:15,110
That tape that you chew through like rubber.

1034
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:28,360
No, you don't...

1035
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,360
Garlic, you're speaking like...

1036
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:34,309
That's it?

1037
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:35,309
Alright, yeah, sure, okay.

1038
01:02:35,309 --> 01:02:37,309
I will eat a piece of calamari and be like...

1039
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:38,309
Oh!

1040
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:40,679
That's...

1041
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:41,679
Mmm!

1042
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:42,679
That was good.

1043
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:43,679
That was kind of good.

1044
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:44,679
It was a little salty.

1045
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:46,679
But when people pick up...

1046
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:50,679
When people pick up the fucking piece of calamari...

1047
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:52,679
That's...

1048
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:56,679
Like when you launch a grenade launcher at an alien in a fucking video game.

1049
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:58,679
And it's like spread out and all fucking...

1050
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:00,679
Like it looks like this!

1051
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:02,679
It looks like that and it's fried up.

1052
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:03,679
Mmm.

1053
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,679
Nope.

1054
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:05,679
And it's like the legs are...

1055
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:13,510
Nope.

1056
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:14,510
Can't handle squid.

1057
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:15,510
No, why?

1058
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:16,510
I just don't eat it.

1059
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:17,690
I don't want it.

1060
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:18,690
How long does this take to cook?

1061
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:28,349
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright!

1062
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:29,349
Stop, stop, stop!

1063
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:30,349
That was the squid ink!

1064
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:35,409
The taste buds of a child.

1065
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:39,409
A lot of people don't like fucking squid or octopus.

1066
01:03:39,409 --> 01:03:49,199
Why would you want to eat squid ink?

1067
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:54,400
That's just something that humans decided they were going to eat because they decided

1068
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,400
that they thought it would be cool to eat it one day.

1069
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,400
Like, what's the point of this?

1070
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:07,550
It tastes.

1071
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,550
It's tasty.

1072
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,550
I don't...

1073
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,550
I don't agree.

1074
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,550
I've never had it though.

1075
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:25,400
I'm gonna...

1076
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:13,849
I'll be back in an hour with the squid.

1077
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:18,969
No, you know what it is for me?

1078
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:19,969
Here's what it is.

1079
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,969
It's welcome to our restaurant.

1080
01:07:21,969 --> 01:07:26,969
We put squid ink on this to make it so we can charge that plate of food like 30 more

1081
01:07:26,969 --> 01:07:27,969
dollars.

1082
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:29,969
That's what it is.

1083
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:38,059
I'm being scammed.

1084
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:41,280
I'm being scammed.

1085
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,840
You hate to see people get scammed!

1086
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,210
Let's make some pierogies.

1087
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:53,929
More egg cracking.

1088
01:07:53,929 --> 01:07:54,929
I'll get it.

1089
01:07:54,929 --> 01:07:59,559
Perfect.

1090
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:00,559
Just like that.

1091
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,139
Again.

1092
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:04,139
It was identical.

1093
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:06,139
Roll that clip back and watch it.

1094
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:11,420
Where did I go?

1095
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,420
I went to the bathroom.

1096
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,739
Did I tell you I was going to the bathroom?

1097
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:23,399
Wait, it didn't say where I was going?

1098
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:27,180
Wait, what are you talking about?

1099
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,180
Oh, it's...

1100
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,180
My voice is delayed by a thousand milliseconds.

1101
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,420
So, when I say something right here, you hear it a full second later.

1102
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,420
So, I said, hey, I'm going to the bathroom.

1103
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,420
Be right back.

1104
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:38,420
And I muted.

1105
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,420
So, you didn't hear that.

1106
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,039
Oh.

1107
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:44,539
I muted too quickly for you to get the...

1108
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:45,539
Okay.

1109
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,970
What do you think about these?

1110
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,970
These are getting long, huh?

1111
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:49,970
They look nice though.

1112
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,970
Like, they actually are like very healthy nails.

1113
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,970
They're very healthy.

1114
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:54,970
Too healthy.

1115
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:56,970
They grow like a wheat.

1116
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:01,489
I club them once a fucking week and they just keep going.

1117
01:09:01,489 --> 01:09:09,960
What's next?

1118
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,960
All right.

1119
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,779
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1120
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:16,960
Put it down.

1121
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,960
Put it down.

1122
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,260
Sell the clippings.

1123
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,260
I can't think of anything more disgusting than what you just said.

1124
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,260
Except for maybe eat squid ink pasta.

1125
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,260
No, no, no.

1126
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,260
Put it down.

1127
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,260
Put it down.

1128
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,260
Put it down.

1129
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:37,760
Put it down.

1130
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,760
Put it down.

1131
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:44,539
Put it down.

1132
01:09:44,539 --> 01:09:45,909
Put it down.

1133
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:46,909
Leave this dough.

1134
01:09:46,909 --> 01:10:03,939
Are we making squid ink pasta again?

1135
01:10:03,939 --> 01:10:05,939
I want his points back.

1136
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:09,539
Where's the boomer brace?

1137
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,539
I haven't been wearing it lately.

1138
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:14,539
It's been constricting me and giving me a little sore.

1139
01:10:14,539 --> 01:10:16,779
Oh, let's shape the pierogies.

1140
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,859
Okay.

1141
01:10:18,859 --> 01:10:20,859
They have to shape them.

1142
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:22,989
Okay.

1143
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:29,289
Get it?

1144
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:30,289
When am I done shaping it?

1145
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:40,939
No, no.

1146
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:41,939
Other way.

1147
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:43,939
Other way.

1148
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:53,380
Stop going the other way.

1149
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,380
You can't go faster than this, guys.

1150
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,380
The snow go faster.

1151
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:09,880
Why does he look so upset?

1152
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:33,430
I think that's just my face.

1153
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:35,430
Rest in boomer face.

1154
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:43,539
All right.

1155
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:44,970
Stretch the dough.

1156
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:46,970
Move it forward and backward to stretch the dough.

1157
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:50,140
Rotate dough with one and two.

1158
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,140
Okay.

1159
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,140
We're going to spread it out.

1160
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,140
One and two.

1161
01:11:54,140 --> 01:12:15,479
Careful.

1162
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:16,479
Careful.

1163
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:17,479
Mm.

1164
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:18,479
Mm.

1165
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:19,479
Mm.

1166
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:24,239
Mm.

1167
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,079
Mm.

1168
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:34,060
Pierogies are awesome.

1169
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,060
I love pierogies.

1170
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:38,260
My mother used to make pierogies.

1171
01:12:38,260 --> 01:13:00,130
It looks like too much onion.

1172
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,130
The wiki.

1173
01:13:05,779 --> 01:13:16,920
Why?

1174
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,920
All right.

1175
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,920
Hold it horizontal and move it as though you are turning the handle.

1176
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:20,920
All right.

1177
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,920
We're going to do the jack in the box.

1178
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:38,460
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1179
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:42,819
Did you wash your hands before prepping this meal?

1180
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:53,630
Of course I did.

1181
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,630
Stir fry.

1182
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,630
Add the buttons.

1183
01:13:55,630 --> 01:14:04,420
Get a little salt in there.

1184
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:05,420
The meat and the pierogies.

1185
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,859
Going to make sure it gets cooked.

1186
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:07,859
Come on, meat.

1187
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:08,859
A little bit more.

1188
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:09,859
A little bit more onion.

1189
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:12,380
Pierogies.

1190
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,380
We're done.

1191
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,380
Should have left it in there a little longer.

1192
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,319
Now wrap them up.

1193
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:23,000
Okay.

1194
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,630
So we just have to go.

1195
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:28,630
Excuse me.

1196
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,630
Where are the gloves?

1197
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:31,640
Now, I don't eat food prepared by anybody unless they're using rubber cleaning gloves.

1198
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,640
That wasn't a lot of meat.

1199
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,989
This one's, all right.

1200
01:14:35,989 --> 01:14:36,989
This one's a little light.

1201
01:14:36,989 --> 01:14:44,180
All right.

1202
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,180
I know.

1203
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,180
I didn't do enough meat.

1204
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,180
Let's do.

1205
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:55,210
Okay.

1206
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,210
What are we going to do?

1207
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:57,210
What are we going to do?

1208
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:58,210
What are we going to do?

1209
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:59,210
What are we going to do?

1210
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:01,510
All right.

1211
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:02,510
I know.

1212
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:03,510
I didn't do enough meat.

1213
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:04,510
Let's do.

1214
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:07,159
Okay.

1215
01:15:07,159 --> 01:15:08,159
We'll compensate more meat.

1216
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,130
Yeah.

1217
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,130
That's a big.

1218
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:13,130
That's a hearty one.

1219
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:14,130
We're just out of the side a little bit.

1220
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,130
It's all right.

1221
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:16,130
You just tip it upside down.

1222
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:17,130
You go.

1223
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:29,890
That's all you need to do.

1224
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,260
Deep fry.

1225
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,260
Grab the ingredients on the tray with the V button and add them to the oil.

1226
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:39,260
When they're fully cooked, grab with the V button and put them on the bottom tray.

1227
01:15:58,699 --> 01:15:59,699
Do not mind.

1228
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:00,699
Do not mind.

1229
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:01,699
Do not mind.

1230
01:16:01,699 --> 01:16:02,699
Wait.

1231
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:03,699
Did I pick these up?

1232
01:16:03,699 --> 01:16:04,699
All right.

1233
01:16:04,699 --> 01:16:05,699
Turn the heat down.

1234
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:06,699
That's good.

1235
01:16:06,699 --> 01:16:07,699
Oh, it wasn't.

1236
01:16:07,699 --> 01:16:08,699
They weren't done.

1237
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:09,699
Do not mind.

1238
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:10,699
One pierogi.

1239
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,579
They all wasted.

1240
01:16:12,579 --> 01:16:30,619
It seems like you have only one pierogi on your plate, judges.

1241
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:31,619
Yeah.

1242
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:37,369
Germa, you just wasted like $40 worth of food.

1243
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:45,859
Have you ever used a stove before?

1244
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:55,890
I don't know.

1245
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,890
I've never actually used a stove before.

1246
01:16:57,890 --> 01:16:59,899
Uh, this looks...

1247
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:00,899
I don't want this.

1248
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:01,899
It's like tapeworm stew.

1249
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:02,899
I don't want it.

1250
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:03,899
Uh, what is that?

1251
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:04,899
No.

1252
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:05,899
What is that?

1253
01:17:05,899 --> 01:17:06,899
Lasagna?

1254
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:07,899
No, no.

1255
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:08,899
Get rid of it.

1256
01:17:08,899 --> 01:17:09,899
Get rid of it.

1257
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:13,100
That's not appetizing to me.

1258
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,100
I don't like this.

1259
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,100
It looks like fruit roll-ups.

1260
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,100
Don't want it.

1261
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,850
Hand-fried lobster.

1262
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:21,850
Parimpuffs.

1263
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:22,850
Those are awesome.

1264
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:24,789
What is this?

1265
01:17:24,789 --> 01:17:27,350
Actually, mussels are pretty good.

1266
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,350
I ate mussels once.

1267
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:35,390
Oh, fuck.

1268
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:36,390
I didn't look at the instructions.

1269
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:41,859
They're open.

1270
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:42,859
They're done.

1271
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:53,899
I thought when the shell opens, it means it's cooked, right?

1272
01:17:53,899 --> 01:17:59,729
That's what it means?

1273
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:00,729
Yes.

1274
01:18:00,729 --> 01:18:03,180
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1275
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,180
So what was wrong with that?

1276
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,180
The shell opened.

1277
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:10,960
When they open up, pick them up with B and move them to the tray.

1278
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,960
So what the fuck?

1279
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:33,479
What are you going to overcook this shit?

1280
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:39,109
When they open, how is that wrong?

1281
01:18:39,109 --> 01:18:45,470
Food poisoning.

1282
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:52,590
It said when they pop open, move them to the tray.

1283
01:18:52,590 --> 01:19:02,539
Awesome.

1284
01:19:02,539 --> 01:19:23,100
They're open.

1285
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,920
They're open.

1286
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,500
I did wait.

1287
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,500
It said, take it, please.

1288
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,770
Look.

1289
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:35,770
Just literally wait for the arrow.

1290
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:43,220
I did.

1291
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,220
Okay, this one's done.

1292
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,710
This one's done.

1293
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:48,140
Now this one's done.

1294
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,140
Mine were done, too.

1295
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:50,140
That's horseshit.

1296
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,140
Mine were done.

1297
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,140
I didn't have an arrow on it.

1298
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,140
Wonderful.

1299
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,449
Better than mama.

1300
01:19:54,449 --> 01:20:01,779
Yeah, my last dish was better than yours, too.

1301
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:02,779
Yes, they were.

1302
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:15,260
Don't criticize the streamer.

1303
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:30,579
Let's mince.

1304
01:20:30,579 --> 01:20:41,020
I love that.

1305
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:44,649
Play this for me.

1306
01:20:44,649 --> 01:20:46,649
I have a shitload of Wii games back here.

1307
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:48,649
So I'm enjoying myself.

1308
01:20:48,649 --> 01:21:00,039
I think it's fun.

1309
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:02,039
Dedicated cooking mama stream.

1310
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:13,970
I don't like squid.

1311
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:18,340
Squids are like, I don't like squid beater.

1312
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,960
Oh.

1313
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,710
Oh.

1314
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:23,710
Oh.

1315
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:42,939
I think you're ripping off the thing's fucking legs.

1316
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,939
I don't like it.

1317
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:47,939
I'm never eating meat ever again.

1318
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:48,939
I don't know.

1319
01:21:48,939 --> 01:21:50,939
It freaks me out sometimes.

1320
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:51,939
Wonderful.

1321
01:21:51,939 --> 01:21:54,460
Better than mama.

1322
01:21:54,460 --> 01:22:01,729
He's going to puke.

1323
01:22:01,729 --> 01:22:02,729
That's bullshit.

1324
01:22:02,729 --> 01:22:05,500
All right.

1325
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,500
Oh, wait.

1326
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,600
Okay.

1327
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,220
Let's go.

1328
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:17,779
All done.

1329
01:22:17,779 --> 01:22:20,229
Let's get a couple of good ones.

1330
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:23,069
All right.

1331
01:22:23,069 --> 01:22:24,069
All right.

1332
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:25,069
Come on.

1333
01:22:25,069 --> 01:22:31,560
Come on.

1334
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:36,510
Come on.

1335
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:37,510
Squid.

1336
01:22:39,899 --> 01:22:44,699
Not in a different...

1337
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:47,159
What was that?

1338
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:55,420
Why is it doing this?

1339
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,300
What?

1340
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,300
Oh, shit.

1341
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,300
Okay.

1342
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:03,079
I got it.

1343
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:04,079
Is it sake?

1344
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,079
I love sake.

1345
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:06,079
Sake is great.

1346
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:07,079
All right.

1347
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:09,789
Let's make paeyas.

1348
01:23:09,789 --> 01:23:11,789
I'm going to be the paeya, not the paeyas.

1349
01:23:11,789 --> 01:23:15,800
You don't like wrap them up.

1350
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,489
Arrange them as you'd like.

1351
01:23:18,489 --> 01:23:19,489
All right.

1352
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:20,489
Let's arrange them as we'd like.

1353
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:21,489
So let's...

1354
01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:22,489
Oh.

1355
01:23:22,489 --> 01:24:01,090
Better than mama.

1356
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,090
What?

1357
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:05,310
It was fine.

1358
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:12,090
I did that because you want to get some broth first, and then you pick the stuff off the

1359
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,090
top that you want.

1360
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:17,390
I make my paeya buffet style.

1361
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:24,920
Oh, it's delicious when I make it.

1362
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:29,180
If you ever come over, I'll make it for you.

1363
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,180
It'll be like...

1364
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,180
Oh, yeah.

1365
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:35,260
And then we'll go have a steak.

1366
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,260
New recipe.

1367
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,260
All right.

1368
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,899
Shrimp and chili sauce.

1369
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:44,220
That sounds pretty good.

1370
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:45,220
All right.

1371
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,220
Should I make the cream puffs?

1372
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,859
Wait.

1373
01:24:48,859 --> 01:24:49,859
What else is there?

1374
01:24:50,859 --> 01:24:54,869
How about a good old-fashioned American hot dog?

1375
01:24:54,869 --> 01:24:58,430
Yeah, we got to make some American food.

1376
01:24:58,430 --> 01:25:02,670
I know that there's like a shitload of Europeans in here that are like, ugh.

1377
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:19,170
Let's watch.

1378
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:23,340
The sophistication of American cuisine.

1379
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:28,899
Watch as I use the knife to slice the bread down the middle.

1380
01:25:28,899 --> 01:25:38,720
And watch as I put hot dog into a bun.

1381
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:49,659
Outside, apparently.

1382
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:50,659
What the fuck is this?

1383
01:25:50,659 --> 01:25:59,050
How much of this do I have to put on?

1384
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:11,380
This much cheese on my hot dog.

1385
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:22,659
Decorate it.

1386
01:26:22,659 --> 01:26:24,659
This is American cuisine.

1387
01:26:24,659 --> 01:26:30,659
Make a hot dog and then be at the fucking Fridays with a placemat as a four-year-old

1388
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:33,659
and draw with a crayon all over the placemat.

1389
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:46,140
Oh, this is ketchup and mustard.

1390
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:03,020
Okay, that's a mustard sandwich?

1391
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:09,020
With a handle, that's a hot dog.

1392
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:12,020
You pick that up by the hot dog and eat that.

1393
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:30,409
That's a reverse corn dog.

1394
01:27:30,409 --> 01:27:33,899
Double cheeseburger, American.

1395
01:27:33,899 --> 01:27:35,899
We're doing all the American stuff first, because I'm American.

1396
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:38,899
And I'm going to tell you how correct it is.

1397
01:27:38,899 --> 01:27:39,899
This is a double cheeseburger.

1398
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:42,399
Why does it have to be a double?

1399
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:43,399
Why does it have to be a double?

1400
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:44,399
I don't get it.

1401
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:47,470
Why can it just be one single cheeseburger?

1402
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:48,470
What are you saying?

1403
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:50,470
All Americans eat McDouble cheeseburgers?

1404
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:53,470
McDoubles every time they go to the restaurant?

1405
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:57,739
You all do.

1406
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:00,739
When was the last time anyone ordered a single hamburger from McDonald's?

1407
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:03,739
I mean, like a regular cheeseburger.

1408
01:28:03,739 --> 01:28:07,300
I'm not even sure they make those anymore, because people don't order them.

1409
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:12,890
That's a special order now to get a single cheeseburger.

1410
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:15,890
You have to pull around and park in one of the parking spaces,

1411
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,890
because they're not fucking ready for that.

1412
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:21,020
All right, let's see what we've got.

1413
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,539
What kind of veggies have we got in here?

1414
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:25,539
I'll tell you how accurate this is.

1415
01:28:25,539 --> 01:28:29,689
Buns.

1416
01:28:29,689 --> 01:28:30,689
Okay.

1417
01:28:30,689 --> 01:28:31,689
Slice the tomato.

1418
01:28:31,689 --> 01:28:33,689
No tomato on mine, please.

1419
01:28:33,689 --> 01:28:39,699
Yes, please give me something that makes everything wet and acidic while I bite into it.

1420
01:28:39,699 --> 01:28:40,699
Disgusting.

1421
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:42,699
Get it off my hamburger.

1422
01:28:47,539 --> 01:28:53,319
Tear the lettuce.

1423
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:54,319
Oh, what?

1424
01:28:54,319 --> 01:29:03,979
Did I break my finger?

1425
01:29:03,979 --> 01:29:10,600
Why do we have to do this?

1426
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,600
Why don't we use the pieces?

1427
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,600
Is it like something in the center?

1428
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:19,380
Can we take all that lettuce off to get to the center of the lettuce?

1429
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,380
Eat the center of the lettuce.

1430
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:28,210
Make the meat.

1431
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:31,210
All right, I'm very, very American, because I looked at this and went,

1432
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:32,210
what the fuck are they talking about?

1433
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:37,210
Just go to the grocery store, get patty, and put patty in the pan.

1434
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:49,779
Oh, this is going to make quite a few hamburgers.

1435
01:29:49,779 --> 01:29:52,779
Looks like the whole baseball team is coming over, mama.

1436
01:29:52,779 --> 01:29:57,079
Because this is like 15 hamburgers.

1437
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:04,739
Eggs.

1438
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:05,739
Oh, right.

1439
01:30:05,739 --> 01:30:07,739
It's a binder.

1440
01:30:07,739 --> 01:30:08,739
It's a binder.

1441
01:30:08,739 --> 01:30:23,340
More than two or three eggs to make.

1442
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,340
That seems like a lot.

1443
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:30,060
One hit.

1444
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:35,539
I messed up one this time.

1445
01:30:35,539 --> 01:30:37,899
Perfect record there.

1446
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,899
Perfect record.

1447
01:30:43,399 --> 01:30:44,399
The burger is not a meatball.

1448
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:46,399
You sap it.

1449
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:48,399
Is that the grate the cheese?

1450
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:50,399
Okay, grate the cheese.

1451
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:53,619
Like this?

1452
01:30:53,619 --> 01:30:55,619
How does one do it like this?

1453
01:30:55,619 --> 01:30:56,619
Seems weird.

1454
01:30:56,619 --> 01:31:02,770
All right, grate the cheese.

1455
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:24,970
Do it again.

1456
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:27,659
Do it every time, and I love it.

1457
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:31,659
Because the cheese is so soft when you do that.

1458
01:31:31,659 --> 01:31:36,659
If you grate a fresh block of Parmesan, the cheese is so soft

1459
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:38,659
and almost moist.

1460
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:40,659
And when you pick it up, it just bunches together.

1461
01:31:40,659 --> 01:31:41,659
And it's so...

1462
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:43,659
I love Parmesan cheese.

1463
01:31:43,659 --> 01:31:44,659
It's my favorite.

1464
01:31:44,659 --> 01:31:45,659
I love hard cheese.

1465
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:46,659
I'm a hard cheese guy.

1466
01:31:46,659 --> 01:31:47,659
Not a soft cheese guy.

1467
01:31:47,659 --> 01:31:49,659
Marie sucks.

1468
01:31:49,659 --> 01:31:50,659
Okay?

1469
01:31:50,659 --> 01:31:51,659
Hard cheese, yes.

1470
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:53,659
Soft cheese, get it out of here.

1471
01:31:53,659 --> 01:31:56,020
I'm a hard cheese guy.

1472
01:31:56,020 --> 01:32:00,569
I'm just telling you how I feel.

1473
01:32:00,569 --> 01:32:04,430
Why is this so dirty?

1474
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:06,430
Why are there like bugs at the restaurant?

1475
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:09,779
What's up, Megan?

1476
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:11,539
What's up, girl?

1477
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:14,930
Mama, why are you making me guess?

1478
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:19,510
Mama, I appreciate the fact that you're using one of those old toys

1479
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:21,510
from the fucking early 90s

1480
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:23,510
that you take the magnet and give the guy a beard,

1481
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,510
but get it off my screen, please!

1482
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:34,260
Knead the dough.

1483
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:48,909
The hamburger dough.

1484
01:32:48,909 --> 01:32:52,500
Knead the hamburger dough.

1485
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:59,010
All right, make a hamburger.

1486
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:02,010
Hold the B button to take a piece of hamburger,

1487
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:04,010
then hold the Limo up right

1488
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:06,010
and move left and right to shape the meat.

1489
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:08,380
All right, this is a long one.

1490
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:12,380
So grab some meat.

1491
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:14,380
Up right.

1492
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:20,750
That's not how I've ever done that.

1493
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:22,750
It seems...

1494
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,750
I'm making a pizza?

1495
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:33,069
That's not how you do this.

1496
01:33:34,569 --> 01:33:39,500
If my mother ever saw me doing this in the kitchen,

1497
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,500
she would come and grab my arm and be like,

1498
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,500
hey, hey, hey, hey!

1499
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:54,420
Big patty.

1500
01:33:54,420 --> 01:34:02,189
Why am I playing this?

1501
01:34:02,189 --> 01:34:04,189
Because it's a fun game.

1502
01:34:04,189 --> 01:34:06,189
Because my chibi-robo got fucked up

1503
01:34:06,189 --> 01:34:08,189
because I don't have a...

1504
01:34:08,189 --> 01:34:09,189
I have a corrupted...

1505
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:10,189
You know what?

1506
01:34:10,189 --> 01:34:12,189
Let's just say I started with this.

1507
01:34:14,779 --> 01:34:15,779
All right, butter time.

1508
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:28,800
Come on, get it.

1509
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:34,899
Just forget the first hour of your life here.

1510
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:39,260
All right, time to pan fry.

1511
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:42,260
Turn over, move forward and back.

1512
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,949
Shake just a heap.

1513
01:34:44,949 --> 01:34:46,949
Oh, fuck, I have to make the patty.

1514
01:34:46,949 --> 01:34:50,020
Why does it look like this?

1515
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:56,619
Why is it in half?

1516
01:34:56,619 --> 01:34:58,619
Forward and back to move to flip it.

1517
01:34:58,619 --> 01:35:01,979
Shake it and then adjust the heat while holding A.

1518
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:14,939
Okay, turn it over.

1519
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:15,939
Put it on medium.

1520
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:21,619
Down to low.

1521
01:35:21,619 --> 01:35:23,619
Put the patty over again.

1522
01:35:23,619 --> 01:35:26,560
Put it back on medium heat.

1523
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:31,600
Flip it over again.

1524
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,930
This is huge!

1525
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:36,930
Who is this hamburger for?

1526
01:35:36,930 --> 01:35:38,930
This hamburger is a pancake!

1527
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:40,930
I know who is going to eat this.

1528
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:42,930
This is a challenge burger.

1529
01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:44,930
This is not a hamburger that you eat in a restaurant.

1530
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:48,260
Choose freely.

1531
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:52,579
All right, let's make my ultimate hamburger.

1532
01:35:52,579 --> 01:35:53,579
Are you ready?

1533
01:35:57,579 --> 01:36:00,579
Okay, we're doing cheese down first.

1534
01:36:00,579 --> 01:36:01,579
Then patty.

1535
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:03,579
Then two slices of cheese.

1536
01:36:03,579 --> 01:36:05,579
Then patty.

1537
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:06,579
Then lettuce.

1538
01:36:06,579 --> 01:36:10,439
Then the pickles.

1539
01:36:10,439 --> 01:36:11,439
Get them off.

1540
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:12,439
No, no, no, no.

1541
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:13,439
I don't like pickles.

1542
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:14,439
That's it.

1543
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:16,439
And then where's mayonnaise?

1544
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:17,439
There's mayo.

1545
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:18,439
A little bit of mayo and then a little bit of...

1546
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,439
That's done.

1547
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:22,340
I'm done.

1548
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:25,739
There were no onions.

1549
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:32,920
No, I would do some fresh chopped raw onions too.

1550
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,920
Or maybe some cooked caramelized onions if they were available.

1551
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,920
But they were not.

1552
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:39,760
That's...

1553
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,760
Okay, if there was a little bit of mayonnaise on that

1554
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,760
and there was some caramelized onions,

1555
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,760
I want to eat that right now.

1556
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:55,060
Wait, I told you if it was caramelized or not caramelized,

1557
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:59,149
I'd like it either way.

1558
01:36:59,149 --> 01:37:00,329
Or you know what?

1559
01:37:00,329 --> 01:37:01,329
Get...

1560
01:37:01,329 --> 01:37:02,329
Listen to this.

1561
01:37:02,329 --> 01:37:03,329
It was unavailable.

1562
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:04,329
Get rid of the lettuce.

1563
01:37:04,329 --> 01:37:05,329
Hear me?

1564
01:37:05,329 --> 01:37:06,329
Get rid of the lettuce.

1565
01:37:06,329 --> 01:37:07,890
Mushrooms.

1566
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:10,890
Sauteed mushrooms on top of that.

1567
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:12,770
A little bit of fucking...

1568
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:16,770
A little bit of A1 steak sauce on top of the bun.

1569
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:26,380
Or...

1570
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,380
Nothing.

1571
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:32,779
Bad sauce.

1572
01:37:32,779 --> 01:37:33,779
Ew.

1573
01:37:33,779 --> 01:37:34,779
Bad sauce.

1574
01:37:34,779 --> 01:37:38,449
Ew.

1575
01:37:38,449 --> 01:37:39,449
Bad sauce.

1576
01:37:39,449 --> 01:37:40,449
Wait, I just made the...

1577
01:37:40,449 --> 01:37:42,010
I made the...

1578
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:43,010
I just made that.

1579
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:44,010
Reversed.

1580
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:48,380
Washed.

1581
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:49,380
Oh, this is the blood soup, right?

1582
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:50,380
I know how to make this.

1583
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:51,380
Good to you.

1584
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:52,380
Okay.

1585
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:53,380
That Hachini.

1586
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:56,380
I love that Hachini.

1587
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,380
Salisbury steak.

1588
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,380
Can I make the blood soup?

1589
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:03,460
All right.

1590
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:04,460
I'm going to make blood soup.

1591
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:05,460
A1 steak sauce.

1592
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:21,619
A1 steak sauce.

1593
01:38:21,619 --> 01:38:22,619
Oh, sorry.

1594
01:38:22,619 --> 01:38:23,619
A1 steak sauce.

1595
01:38:23,619 --> 01:38:26,710
Or barbecue sauce.

1596
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:27,710
Or something very, very dense.

1597
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:28,710
Or just some Swiss cheese.

1598
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:41,859
A little bit of mayo.

1599
01:38:41,859 --> 01:38:42,859
Mushroom.

1600
01:38:42,859 --> 01:38:52,159
A mushroom in Swiss hamburger, guys, is incredibly common and very popular.

1601
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:55,159
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

1602
01:38:55,159 --> 01:39:00,159
A Swiss cheese in mushroom hamburger is on every menu at every restaurant you've ever

1603
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:03,159
been to that serves more than three different kinds of hamburgers.

1604
01:39:03,159 --> 01:39:04,979
What...

1605
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:05,979
Where are you guys from?

1606
01:39:05,979 --> 01:39:06,979
Fucking Maz?

1607
01:39:06,979 --> 01:39:16,420
Dude, I'll go even a step further.

1608
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:17,420
I'll go a step further.

1609
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:18,420
You want me to go a step further?

1610
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,420
I will.

1611
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:27,420
I'm one of those guys that I would be totally happy if you gave me just sauteed mushrooms

1612
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,420
with butter.

1613
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:31,420
I would just eat the fuck out of them.

1614
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:35,420
Sauteed mushrooms and onions with butter.

1615
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:39,619
I would just eat that and I would be happy.

1616
01:39:39,619 --> 01:39:42,989
They're so unbelievably delicious.

1617
01:39:42,989 --> 01:39:47,989
Sauteed mushrooms in butter is un-fucking-bearably delicious.

1618
01:39:47,989 --> 01:39:53,869
I can't even imagine somebody that would disagree with that.

1619
01:39:53,869 --> 01:39:57,869
Those of you that get it, imagine like right when you're done sauteing and they're in the

1620
01:39:57,869 --> 01:40:00,869
butter, the mushrooms, and you take that forkful and you just taste it to make sure

1621
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,869
you got it right.

1622
01:40:02,869 --> 01:40:05,869
Imagine not liking that and not thinking that was at the top of the list.

1623
01:40:05,869 --> 01:40:08,869
Can you imagine being that person?

1624
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:22,060
I'm that guy that sounds awful.

1625
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:26,060
It's so good.

1626
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:30,060
Hold on, there's a cattle.

1627
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:37,090
Mushroom crew.

1628
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:44,680
He's preaching.

1629
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:47,859
Beets are okay.

1630
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:48,859
I don't like to eat beets.

1631
01:40:48,859 --> 01:40:50,859
I like to drink beets.

1632
01:40:50,859 --> 01:40:54,899
They kind of taste like dirt.

1633
01:40:54,899 --> 01:41:02,369
A nice beet salad though, it's okay.

1634
01:41:02,369 --> 01:41:06,369
But beets blended in with another juice or something as a base.

1635
01:41:06,369 --> 01:41:08,369
I like beet juice.

1636
01:41:08,369 --> 01:41:09,369
I think it's okay.

1637
01:41:09,369 --> 01:41:13,369
I'm not a big fan of people that drive by 100 miles per hour by next to the house.

1638
01:41:13,369 --> 01:41:15,369
I'm really not a fan of that.

1639
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:25,060
How do I feel about borscht?

1640
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:27,060
I've never had it actually.

1641
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,060
I've never eaten this.

1642
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:30,060
It looks like it'll be alright.

1643
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:34,500
Beet salad?

1644
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:35,500
Yeah, beet salad's good.

1645
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:46,680
Alright, I'll get this one right now.

1646
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:47,680
White powder?

1647
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,680
What is white powder?

1648
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,680
White powder?

1649
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,649
What is that?

1650
01:41:54,649 --> 01:41:57,300
What's going on?

1651
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:58,300
Hello?

1652
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:59,300
What's going on?

1653
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:00,729
Why is nothing blinking?

1654
01:42:00,729 --> 01:42:02,029
I have to shake?

1655
01:42:02,029 --> 01:42:03,029
What happened?

1656
01:42:03,029 --> 01:42:07,319
Mama, tell me!

1657
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:10,689
Mama, tell me what you want!

1658
01:42:10,689 --> 01:42:12,699
Mama!

1659
01:42:12,699 --> 01:42:15,699
You can't just stare at me, Mama!

1660
01:42:15,699 --> 01:42:16,699
Mama!

1661
01:42:16,699 --> 01:42:17,699
Mama!

1662
01:42:17,699 --> 01:42:19,510
It didn't crash?

1663
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:21,510
The timer's still going.

1664
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:25,850
This is where Mama goes.

1665
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:26,850
Oh, sorry.

1666
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:29,850
She puts her phone down on the fucking table and it's like, Mom!

1667
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:38,550
Remove the foam.

1668
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:44,579
Hold the V button while pulling upward and lift the foam?

1669
01:42:44,579 --> 01:42:59,970
What is this, bacteria?

1670
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:01,970
No, borscht is awesome, Jeremy.

1671
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:04,970
You just have to remove the mold that cooks off.

1672
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:22,420
That's fat from the meat?

1673
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:25,420
I know what it is.

1674
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:29,369
Thank you for taking the bait.

1675
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:30,369
Thank you.

1676
01:43:30,369 --> 01:43:36,899
Alright, let's do it.

1677
01:43:36,899 --> 01:43:46,609
He doesn't know.

1678
01:43:46,609 --> 01:43:49,609
I was merely pretending the whole time.

1679
01:43:49,609 --> 01:43:58,659
Can I put this in?

1680
01:43:58,659 --> 01:44:04,979
How about a little bit of this?

1681
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:08,689
Yeah, some laurel.

1682
01:44:08,689 --> 01:44:10,989
Next goes in the blood.

1683
01:44:10,989 --> 01:44:12,989
Didn't have a blood soup without blood.

1684
01:44:12,989 --> 01:44:17,689
And then the cabbage.

1685
01:44:17,689 --> 01:44:28,890
Where are the beans?

1686
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:34,119
I said I didn't forget it.

1687
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:45,819
There's blood in the borscht?

1688
01:44:45,819 --> 01:44:46,819
I'd probably try it.

1689
01:44:46,819 --> 01:44:53,539
It looks like it would be alright.

1690
01:44:53,539 --> 01:44:55,539
This is not even how you make borscht.

1691
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:59,189
I mean, it's close enough.

1692
01:44:59,189 --> 01:45:00,189
What are those?

1693
01:45:00,189 --> 01:45:02,189
Potato tots?

1694
01:45:02,189 --> 01:45:06,460
Tater tots.

1695
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:11,949
Tater...

1696
01:45:11,949 --> 01:45:13,949
Chicken kieb.

1697
01:45:13,949 --> 01:45:15,949
Uh, yeah.

1698
01:45:15,949 --> 01:45:18,130
Wait, is this like chicken cordon bleu?

1699
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:21,130
Is this like a frost filled with ham and chicken and cheese and stuff?

1700
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:22,130
That was pretty good.

1701
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:24,130
I like chicken cordon bleu.

1702
01:45:24,130 --> 01:45:36,159
Alright, mince meat.

1703
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:38,159
I love chicken cordon bleu.

1704
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:41,300
It's so good.

1705
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,300
This is human skin.

1706
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:50,399
Why did you say that and why did I read that?

1707
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:58,460
Butter, salt.

1708
01:45:58,460 --> 01:45:59,460
That was easy.

1709
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:02,149
It's basically chicken nuggets.

1710
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:11,020
Aw, damn you, I'm fasting.

1711
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:14,750
It's supposed to be cheapy, Robo.

1712
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:16,750
I know, I'm sorry.

1713
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:20,359
I know.

1714
01:46:20,359 --> 01:46:24,500
It will be tomorrow.

1715
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:28,500
I will buy like ten different memory cards.

1716
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:31,000
And an SD card.

1717
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I'll have them all connected at the same time to make sure it works.

1718
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:51,619
Alright, let's shape it up.

1719
01:46:51,619 --> 01:46:58,020
These are hefty chicken nuggets.

1720
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:02,189
He's getting disgusting hands all over our chicken nuggets.

1721
01:47:02,189 --> 01:47:03,189
I already winked.

1722
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:09,529
I just did.

1723
01:47:09,529 --> 01:47:12,600
Oh, that was a big one.

1724
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:21,479
Wink again.

1725
01:47:21,479 --> 01:47:28,970
These are huge.

1726
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:31,970
Use your feet to make the nuggets instead of your hands.

1727
01:47:31,970 --> 01:47:34,979
Oh my god.

1728
01:47:34,979 --> 01:47:36,979
This is like a whole breast.

1729
01:47:36,979 --> 01:47:43,579
This is like mom or dad doesn't care anymore.

1730
01:47:43,579 --> 01:47:44,579
Can you make me chicken nuggets?

1731
01:47:44,579 --> 01:47:46,579
Yeah, sure.

1732
01:47:46,579 --> 01:47:49,659
Here.

1733
01:47:49,659 --> 01:47:50,659
Just bite it.

1734
01:47:50,659 --> 01:47:54,050
Just eat it slow.

1735
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:56,050
Just one super nugget.

1736
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:07,960
Alright, grate the cheese.

1737
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:11,220
I'm pretty good at grating cheese at this point.

1738
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:40,579
Not cheese, by the way.

1739
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:46,569
Alright, eggs.

1740
01:48:46,569 --> 01:48:48,569
Can't make a chicken kebab without eggs.

1741
01:48:48,569 --> 01:48:58,229
What is she saying?

1742
01:48:58,229 --> 01:49:01,050
Do not what?

1743
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:14,409
Do not nine?

1744
01:49:16,409 --> 01:49:19,100
What is she saying?

1745
01:49:22,279 --> 01:49:24,279
Do not mind?

1746
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:26,279
Alright, stir it up.

1747
01:49:26,279 --> 01:49:28,279
Don't go too fast.

1748
01:49:28,279 --> 01:49:47,800
Put that over a hot stove.

1749
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,800
Steam it a little bit.

1750
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,800
Rizzle that on some eggs with some toast.

1751
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,800
You guys sell fucking fake eggs Benedict.

1752
01:49:53,800 --> 01:50:04,680
Try the chicken.

1753
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:15,300
Alright, this is kind of ridiculous.

1754
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:42,949
Okay, got it.

1755
01:50:42,949 --> 01:50:55,750
Not done.

1756
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:57,750
Stop rubbing mold on the chicken nuggets.

1757
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:59,750
I got a super scroller on that.

1758
01:51:04,489 --> 01:51:08,329
Heat fry.

1759
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:10,329
When they're fully cooked, grab them with the B button.

1760
01:51:10,329 --> 01:51:18,460
Alright, we're going to do one at a time.

1761
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,460
Three at a time is fine.

1762
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:25,510
Okay, so let's increase the heat a little bit.

1763
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:27,510
Over the heat a little.

1764
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:33,979
Are they done?

1765
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:36,279
Are these done?

1766
01:51:40,279 --> 01:51:42,649
Oh my god, they're black!

1767
01:51:42,649 --> 01:51:44,649
Turn the heat down.

1768
01:51:44,649 --> 01:51:46,649
I got to get at least one.

1769
01:51:46,649 --> 01:51:48,649
Otherwise the judges are going to fucking kill me.

1770
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:12,729
Mine didn't look like that.

1771
01:52:12,729 --> 01:52:14,729
These look kind of good.

1772
01:52:14,729 --> 01:52:17,220
I would eat these.

1773
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:20,300
These actually look pretty good.

1774
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,300
I feel like this would be like cutting into these.

1775
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:24,300
You get the moist chicken with the crunchy outside.

1776
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:26,539
What is this over here though?

1777
01:52:26,539 --> 01:52:29,420
What's this moss? What is that?

1778
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:31,420
I didn't make that.

1779
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:38,840
New recipe.

1780
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:40,840
New recipe.

1781
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:46,279
Beef stroganoff.

1782
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:48,279
Alright, what did we miss?

1783
01:52:50,779 --> 01:52:52,779
We didn't do shrimp and chili sauce.

1784
01:52:52,779 --> 01:52:57,510
Let's do shrimp and chili sauce.

1785
01:52:57,510 --> 01:53:09,539
Lettuce.

1786
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:30,649
Can't we just cut it up?

1787
01:53:30,649 --> 01:53:32,649
Prepare. Rip the head off the squid.

1788
01:53:32,649 --> 01:53:34,649
And then dump all of its ink into a bowl.

1789
01:53:57,939 --> 01:53:59,939
Head of the mama, that's good.

1790
01:53:59,939 --> 01:54:03,000
Alright, chop. Chop time.

1791
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:09,340
He's going to puke again.

1792
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:11,340
That's a lucky one.

1793
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:14,659
Right down the middle like that.

1794
01:54:14,659 --> 01:54:16,659
You know one of my favorite snacks was growing up?

1795
01:54:16,659 --> 01:54:19,159
Take a celery stalk.

1796
01:54:19,159 --> 01:54:21,159
Like the boat inside the boat of the celery.

1797
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:25,159
Cut off the ends right.

1798
01:54:25,159 --> 01:54:27,159
Smear peanut butter down the middle.

1799
01:54:27,159 --> 01:54:29,159
Inside the little crevice inside the boat section.

1800
01:54:29,159 --> 01:54:31,159
I loved it.

1801
01:54:31,159 --> 01:54:33,159
Celery peanut butter into the celery boat.

1802
01:54:33,159 --> 01:54:40,579
That's pretty good. Yeah, no, it is good.

1803
01:54:40,579 --> 01:54:42,579
It's a good snack.

1804
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,359
That's a boomer snack.

1805
01:54:52,359 --> 01:54:54,359
It's peanut butter and celery.

1806
01:54:54,359 --> 01:54:59,350
What, you guys don't like peanut butter?

1807
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:01,350
I don't even know what to do.

1808
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:04,039
What is this?

1809
01:55:04,039 --> 01:55:18,310
Ginger?

1810
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:20,310
The zoomers only exist on a diet of uber eats.

1811
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:35,050
Okay, drop in the oil.

1812
01:55:35,050 --> 01:55:46,630
Alright, when the oil reaches the

1813
01:55:46,630 --> 01:55:48,630
correct temperature, add ingredients.

1814
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:51,130
Pilt them to coat them in the oil.

1815
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:53,130
Quickly coat twice

1816
01:55:53,130 --> 01:56:05,159
then finish.

1817
01:56:05,159 --> 01:56:11,180
What? Quickly coat them twice

1818
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:13,180
and then pull them out.

1819
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:15,479
Quickly coat twice and then finish.

1820
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:17,720
I'm just, okay,

1821
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:19,720
look, it may have been raw, but I'm following the direction.

1822
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:22,920
If that was on the back

1823
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,920
of like the blue apron

1824
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:26,920
card, quickly coat

1825
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:28,920
twice and then take them out.

1826
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:30,920
I'd be like, okay, idiot, I just follow

1827
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,920
the instructions. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1828
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:38,039
Alright, sorry, I can cook them right here.

1829
01:56:38,039 --> 01:56:44,060
They're gonna cook right here

1830
01:56:44,060 --> 01:56:46,060
anyway. We'll put them in for a little bit longer.

1831
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:55,590
There we go, and that chili sauce.

1832
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:59,819
Alright.

1833
01:56:59,819 --> 01:57:01,819
Come on, shrimp. They cooked in here.

1834
01:57:01,819 --> 01:57:03,819
That's fine. Why'd I have to cook them twice?

1835
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:13,539
I'm gonna mix squid ink in with your peanut butter.

1836
01:57:13,539 --> 01:57:24,619
Did he ever apologize to

1837
01:57:24,619 --> 01:57:26,619
Mama? Yeah, like two hours ago.

1838
01:57:26,619 --> 01:57:28,619
Where have you been?

1839
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:30,619
Was that crab?

1840
01:57:30,619 --> 01:57:32,619
Ooh, I like crab.

1841
01:57:32,619 --> 01:57:36,520
What is this?

1842
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:41,960
Stir-fried crab.

1843
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:43,960
Oh, stir-fried crab.

1844
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:46,199
Let me try this.

1845
01:57:46,199 --> 01:57:48,890
Stir-fried crab.

1846
01:57:48,890 --> 01:57:50,890
I love crab.

1847
01:57:54,409 --> 01:57:58,630
This went from

1848
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:00,630
it's a chibi-robo stream to everybody

1849
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:02,630
get hungry watching me play

1850
01:58:02,630 --> 01:58:04,630
a 20-year-old cooking game.

1851
01:58:17,109 --> 01:58:19,109
Stir-fried crab.

1852
01:58:19,109 --> 01:58:21,930
I don't want that.

1853
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:25,930
What is such a fun system? What a fun system

1854
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:27,930
this was. I wish the memory card worked.

1855
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:31,189
Sorry, we're past it.

1856
01:58:31,189 --> 01:58:33,189
Alright, shake the Wii mode up and down

1857
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:35,189
to chop the ingredients.

1858
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:42,600
Damn, that's it.

1859
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:46,569
This is chunky.

1860
01:58:53,930 --> 01:58:56,939
The SD card will work.

1861
01:58:56,939 --> 01:58:58,939
I'll make sure this is ready to go.

1862
01:58:58,939 --> 01:59:00,939
I'll make sure of it by tomorrow.

1863
01:59:00,939 --> 01:59:02,939
Alright, cut the pieces.

1864
01:59:02,939 --> 01:59:04,939
A lot of ginger.

1865
01:59:04,939 --> 01:59:06,939
It is kind of a lot of ginger.

1866
01:59:06,939 --> 01:59:08,939
Whoa, alright.

1867
01:59:08,939 --> 01:59:17,640
Turn all the legs off.

1868
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:29,739
Alright, come on. Now what? That's it?

1869
01:59:29,739 --> 01:59:33,640
This kills the crab.

1870
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,640
No. No.

1871
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:41,270
I don't think so.

1872
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:43,270
What are you talking? Alright.

1873
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:49,159
Same thing. Oil.

1874
01:59:49,159 --> 01:59:51,159
Coat them in the oil. Quickly coat them

1875
01:59:51,159 --> 02:00:03,770
twice and then finish.

1876
02:00:03,770 --> 02:00:13,050
Ow! What?

1877
02:00:13,050 --> 02:00:15,050
You can't cook a fucking crab like

1878
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:17,050
that. You don't just put it

1879
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:19,050
in hot oil and take it

1880
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:23,460
out.

1881
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:26,090
That's not how you make food.

1882
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:28,090
You just wasted an entire crab. That crab

1883
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:30,090
was probably like $140.

1884
02:00:30,090 --> 02:00:47,300
It's not that expensive.

1885
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:49,300
Crab meat's cheap. Well, it depends on what kind of

1886
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:51,859
crab this is.

1887
02:00:51,859 --> 02:00:53,859
What is this? Is this crab? Blue crab?

1888
02:00:53,859 --> 02:00:55,859
Snow crab? King crab?

1889
02:00:55,859 --> 02:01:03,859
It depends on what kind of crab

1890
02:01:03,859 --> 02:01:05,859
this is. You can get all kinds of expensive

1891
02:01:05,859 --> 02:01:08,810
crabs. It's the pay attention

1892
02:01:08,810 --> 02:01:14,699
crab. Ah.

1893
02:01:14,699 --> 02:01:20,260
Soy sauce. We're going next.

1894
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:22,699
Oyster sauce.

1895
02:01:22,699 --> 02:01:25,319
And potato

1896
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:33,770
starch. This looks really good.

1897
02:01:33,770 --> 02:01:40,939
Serve as much

1898
02:01:40,939 --> 02:01:43,430
as you'd like. Oh, alright. Let's serve

1899
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:45,930
it. I mean serve as much as you

1900
02:01:45,930 --> 02:02:00,779
like. Wait, no. How do I

1901
02:02:00,779 --> 02:02:04,550
let's put them back together?

1902
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:06,550
Where are the vegetables?

1903
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:25,479
Where are the vegetables?

1904
02:02:25,479 --> 02:02:27,479
No shit! I was trying to serve it. I was

1905
02:02:27,479 --> 02:02:30,869
gonna make my own crab with the

1906
02:02:30,869 --> 02:02:32,869
I was gonna make a fake crab with the tomato

1907
02:02:32,869 --> 02:02:48,420
as a head. Crab

1908
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:52,010
and two cherry tomatoes.

1909
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:54,010
That's a lot of crab though. You wouldn't be

1910
02:02:54,010 --> 02:02:56,010
complaining.

1911
02:02:56,010 --> 02:03:04,180
Alright, let's go back here.

1912
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:08,180
Mapo tofu.

1913
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:10,550
Beef stroganoff.

1914
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:12,859
Let's get it.

1915
02:03:12,859 --> 02:03:14,859
Go back to American food. There's only been two.

1916
02:03:14,859 --> 02:03:17,159
There's only been two American foods.

1917
02:03:17,159 --> 02:03:24,970
Just wait till we get the accurate

1918
02:03:24,970 --> 02:03:26,970
like 3 a.m. Captain Crunch.

1919
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:31,529
Popcorn, hot dog, and hamburger.

1920
02:03:31,529 --> 02:03:36,710
Alright, mama, don't fuck this up.

1921
02:03:36,710 --> 02:04:02,310
Popcorn, hot dog, hamburger.

1922
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:04,310
Yeah, why is the American food the stuff

1923
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:06,310
that you could order at a baseball game?

1924
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:10,729
That's where it ends.

1925
02:04:10,729 --> 02:04:16,170
Alright, let's mince.

1926
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:31,960
Good.

1927
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:33,960
They should have you make apple pie.

1928
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:35,960
How many recipes are even in this game?

1929
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:37,960
Are there a lot of recipes in the game?

1930
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,579
How many recipes are in the game?

1931
02:04:42,579 --> 02:05:02,470
You making a PC?

1932
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:04,470
No, there's no RAM here.

1933
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:06,470
There's no RAM here, man.

1934
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:10,470
There's every single dish ever made.

1935
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:24,420
Nice.

1936
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:29,180
So unhealthy.

1937
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:31,180
Cooking with a bunch of butter in the pan.

1938
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,180
So unhealthy.

1939
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,180
Use avocado oil, idiot.

1940
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:51,539
Wink.

1941
02:05:51,539 --> 02:05:54,300
Get a little salt on there. Get some wine.

1942
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:56,300
Get some pepper on there.

1943
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:58,300
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

1944
02:05:58,300 --> 02:06:20,949
Stew.

1945
02:06:20,949 --> 02:06:24,789
A lot of stews in this game.

1946
02:06:24,789 --> 02:06:26,789
Where's the fucking, where's the pizza?

1947
02:06:26,789 --> 02:06:28,789
Alright, add salt.

1948
02:06:28,789 --> 02:06:39,670
Add milk for a baby.

1949
02:06:39,670 --> 02:06:50,300
Bondu.

1950
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:56,060
It's a little heavy on the onion, but

1951
02:06:56,060 --> 02:06:58,810
karma looks like a basement dweller.

1952
02:06:58,810 --> 02:07:04,810
Well, I'm not in a basement dweller.

1953
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:08,390
I'm in an office.

1954
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:10,390
Come on.

1955
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:12,390
Beef stroganoff.

1956
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:14,390
That looks pretty good.

1957
02:07:21,159 --> 02:07:24,420
Now, have I done them all?

1958
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:26,420
Wait, I didn't do Salisbury Steak.

1959
02:07:26,420 --> 02:07:28,420
You know, of all the

1960
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:30,420
foods in the world, I've

1961
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:32,420
never eaten Salisbury Steak.

1962
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:34,420
But every time I see it, I want it.

1963
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:36,979
It looks so

1964
02:07:36,979 --> 02:07:38,979
delicious and yummy and

1965
02:07:38,979 --> 02:07:40,979
full of flavor. I want it so bad, but I've never

1966
02:07:40,979 --> 02:07:42,979
had it before. I see it all the time

1967
02:07:42,979 --> 02:07:46,699
and I want it.

1968
02:07:46,699 --> 02:07:48,699
I feel like I would really like it. Let's see what's

1969
02:07:48,699 --> 02:07:57,720
in it. It's a burger with sauce?

1970
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:59,720
I would probably like it.

1971
02:08:04,409 --> 02:08:07,100
It's like a weird read between

1972
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:09,100
hamburger and meatloaf.

1973
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:11,100
I would probably really like it.

1974
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:13,100
Let's see.

1975
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:15,100
I'll tell you at the end if I eat it.

1976
02:08:22,859 --> 02:08:24,859
It's high in sodium, but it's really good.

1977
02:08:24,859 --> 02:08:31,260
Mushroom gravy.

1978
02:08:31,260 --> 02:08:33,260
Wait, there's mushrooms on here.

1979
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:36,329
Are there sauteed mushrooms on a Salisbury

1980
02:08:36,329 --> 02:08:42,279
Steak? Yes.

1981
02:08:42,279 --> 02:08:47,529
Why have I not eaten my favorite food yet?

1982
02:08:47,529 --> 02:08:53,739
This is probably my favorite food.

1983
02:08:55,739 --> 02:08:57,739
Sauteed mushrooms. It's like a hamburger

1984
02:08:57,739 --> 02:08:59,739
with gravy and sauce on it.

1985
02:09:01,739 --> 02:09:10,380
Try it.

1986
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:12,380
I'll get it next time I haven't.

1987
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:14,380
Wait, you can't order this.

1988
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:20,069
Where do you get Salisbury Steak?

1989
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:22,069
You can't order it at a restaurant.

1990
02:09:22,069 --> 02:09:25,399
I have to make it

1991
02:09:25,399 --> 02:09:27,399
myself? I'm not very good at that.

1992
02:09:27,399 --> 02:09:30,729
No, I'm not going to get the one that's in the frozen

1993
02:09:30,729 --> 02:09:32,729
food section. No. I want a real one.

1994
02:09:32,729 --> 02:09:40,579
At a diner. What

1995
02:09:40,579 --> 02:09:45,829
is this?

1996
02:09:45,829 --> 02:09:47,829
Egg, okay.

1997
02:09:47,829 --> 02:09:49,829
Breadcrumbs.

1998
02:09:49,829 --> 02:09:52,140
Pepper.

1999
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:54,140
Nutmeg.

2000
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:58,279
At a diner?

2001
02:09:58,279 --> 02:10:00,279
It's at Southern Shit Diners.

2002
02:10:02,279 --> 02:10:15,340
Hey, where do I get Salisbury

2003
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:17,340
Steak? Oh, at a Southern Shit

2004
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:19,340
Diner.

2005
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:21,340
Let me look that up on Yelp

2006
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:23,340
and see what it's got for reviews.

2007
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:33,430
God damn it.

2008
02:10:33,430 --> 02:10:46,550
Salisbury Steak.

2009
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:50,970
I want this though. What is this part?

2010
02:10:50,970 --> 02:10:52,970
What's this right here?

2011
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:56,229
What is that? Is that supposed to be like a

2012
02:10:56,229 --> 02:10:58,229
cheese or is that another meat?

2013
02:10:58,229 --> 02:11:00,789
Is that the cheese with the wax on it?

2014
02:11:00,789 --> 02:11:04,060
That's salmon?

2015
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:06,060
Oh, why would that be in Salisbury Steak?

2016
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:08,060
You told me it was sauteed mushrooms and meatloaf.

2017
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:10,060
You didn't say there was a crab shell on here.

2018
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:13,060
Alright, make the

2019
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:32,890
hamburger. Dragon fruit.

2020
02:11:32,890 --> 02:11:34,890
Are you talking? Why would they be dragon fruit

2021
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:56,140
in this?

2022
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:58,140
I just saw myself in the fucking webcam.

2023
02:11:58,140 --> 02:12:00,140
I didn't like that. That's fucking

2024
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:08,649
weird. Okay, spread the

2025
02:12:08,649 --> 02:12:10,649
butter. Alright, we're getting to

2026
02:12:10,649 --> 02:12:12,649
that next step coming up here.

2027
02:12:12,649 --> 02:12:14,819
Like the salmon.

2028
02:12:14,819 --> 02:12:17,189
See, this doesn't go in the oven.

2029
02:12:17,189 --> 02:12:19,430
I always thought that Salisbury Steak

2030
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:30,760
was the thing you made in the oven.

2031
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:32,760
No.

2032
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:35,380
He doesn't know?

2033
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:39,029
Fucking egg.

2034
02:12:39,029 --> 02:12:41,720
What?

2035
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,720
Is eggs on here?

2036
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:46,920
Shake to shake it and then

2037
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:48,920
yeah, mix it. Hold the Wii mode upright and turn it around

2038
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:50,920
while holding B and then A is salt.

2039
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:52,920
You cook eggs?

2040
02:13:01,239 --> 02:13:08,520
Those look good.

2041
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:11,399
Those look

2042
02:13:11,399 --> 02:13:13,399
good.

2043
02:13:13,399 --> 02:13:24,649
Let's make the big pie.

2044
02:13:24,649 --> 02:13:32,949
Turn it. Medium heat.

2045
02:13:32,949 --> 02:13:36,090
Sear it on one side.

2046
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:38,840
Look at the loaf. Spin it.

2047
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:43,189
I know what this smells like too.

2048
02:13:43,189 --> 02:13:45,689
Like if I lean

2049
02:13:45,689 --> 02:13:47,689
in and just put my face over the screen, like I

2050
02:13:47,689 --> 02:13:50,500
could smell that.

2051
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:53,060
Oh, that smells so good.

2052
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:55,689
Especially the mushrooms

2053
02:13:55,689 --> 02:13:57,689
scent in there.

2054
02:13:57,689 --> 02:13:59,689
Oh, it smells so good.

2055
02:13:59,689 --> 02:14:01,689
Smell-O-Vision. Alright, make some

2056
02:14:01,689 --> 02:14:03,689
decorative cuts.

2057
02:14:03,689 --> 02:14:07,340
Where's the mushrooms?

2058
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:10,789
Why is there a fucking

2059
02:14:10,789 --> 02:14:12,789
decorative hot dog?

2060
02:14:12,789 --> 02:14:24,619
I would pick that off

2061
02:14:24,619 --> 02:14:26,619
the plate and like set

2062
02:14:26,619 --> 02:14:28,619
it slowly aside next

2063
02:14:28,619 --> 02:14:31,289
to me. Off the plate.

2064
02:14:31,289 --> 02:14:33,289
I wouldn't, I don't, I wouldn't want to eat that.

2065
02:14:33,289 --> 02:14:35,779
Alright, serve as much as you'd like.

2066
02:14:35,779 --> 02:14:40,710
Okay, what is this?

2067
02:14:40,710 --> 02:15:02,069
Happy birthday.

2068
02:15:02,069 --> 02:15:09,239
You can just put as many

2069
02:15:09,239 --> 02:15:11,239
as you want. Why?

2070
02:15:11,239 --> 02:15:13,670
What is this? What is this?

2071
02:15:13,670 --> 02:15:16,680
Dessert? Hold on, wait,

2072
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:40,170
wait. Yes, I ordered the sauce

2073
02:15:40,170 --> 02:15:42,729
for a steak. Oh, okay, sure.

2074
02:15:42,729 --> 02:15:44,729
Oh yeah, this is a dozen

2075
02:15:44,729 --> 02:15:47,539
eggs. And

2076
02:15:47,539 --> 02:15:49,539
this really flogs that we've been in the fridge

2077
02:15:49,539 --> 02:15:56,520
since last Wednesday. Wait,

2078
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:02,539
where are the mushrooms? What is that?

2079
02:16:02,539 --> 02:16:06,180
Sausages?

2080
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:08,939
What is that? Sausages.

2081
02:16:08,939 --> 02:16:12,390
Yup, let's go.

2082
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:14,390
Grate the cheese. Do we make

2083
02:16:14,390 --> 02:16:16,569
the links? Do we actually make them?

2084
02:16:16,569 --> 02:16:18,569
Not everything needs to have mushrooms

2085
02:16:18,569 --> 02:16:20,569
you spore snorter.

2086
02:16:22,869 --> 02:16:25,369
The thing is, I don't, I only

2087
02:16:25,369 --> 02:16:27,369
like the, okay, I don't know much

2088
02:16:27,369 --> 02:16:29,369
about mushrooms. I just know the one that I like.

2089
02:16:29,369 --> 02:16:31,369
I like the

2090
02:16:31,369 --> 02:16:34,440
the ones you just buy

2091
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:36,440
at the grocery store that are just sitting there

2092
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:38,440
that are in the package.

2093
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:40,440
What are they? Portobello?

2094
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:42,440
I don't like it. That's the only one I like.

2095
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:48,200
The grocery

2096
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:51,530
store ones.

2097
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:53,530
The ones that are already chopped up

2098
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:55,530
that are in the little package with the plastic on

2099
02:16:55,530 --> 02:16:57,530
top. And there's like 700 of them lined up.

2100
02:16:57,530 --> 02:16:59,530
The grocery store mushroom.

2101
02:16:59,530 --> 02:17:14,760
Colorado? They look

2102
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:16,760
like a white, like they're white.

2103
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:22,500
They're white.

2104
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:26,600
They're white button mushrooms.

2105
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:28,600
They're not portobello. They're called button mushrooms.

2106
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:32,309
3D printed

2107
02:17:32,309 --> 02:17:35,829
mushrooms.

2108
02:17:35,829 --> 02:17:37,829
Why does this stream have 6,000

2109
02:17:37,829 --> 02:17:39,829
viewers?

2110
02:17:39,829 --> 02:17:41,829
I don't know.

2111
02:17:41,829 --> 02:17:45,459
Why does this stream

2112
02:17:45,459 --> 02:17:48,020
have 10 viewers? What are you doing

2113
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:51,739
here? What are you doing

2114
02:17:51,739 --> 02:17:58,069
here? Is this seaweed?

2115
02:17:58,069 --> 02:18:01,379
Parsley.

2116
02:18:01,379 --> 02:18:03,379
Because your face came to the zone.

2117
02:18:03,379 --> 02:18:05,940
Why do I believe that?

2118
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:10,090
Not bad, not bad.

2119
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:12,579
Alright, need the sausages.

2120
02:18:12,579 --> 02:18:14,579
I want to put them in the casing.

2121
02:18:14,579 --> 02:18:16,579
Is it natural casing?

2122
02:18:16,579 --> 02:18:18,579
Okay, a lot of times

2123
02:18:18,579 --> 02:18:20,579
you go to the store or you find sausages

2124
02:18:20,579 --> 02:18:22,579
Oh, natural casing.

2125
02:18:22,579 --> 02:18:24,579
All natural casing.

2126
02:18:24,579 --> 02:18:26,579
Right? What is

2127
02:18:26,579 --> 02:18:28,579
unnatural casing? What is that?

2128
02:18:28,579 --> 02:18:34,260
Plastic.

2129
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:36,260
Natural casing

2130
02:18:36,260 --> 02:18:38,260
is like intestines

2131
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:40,260
or something. What is unnatural casing?

2132
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:42,260
It's an edible plastic?

2133
02:18:42,260 --> 02:18:44,260
Why would anybody eat edible plastic?

2134
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:46,260
Why would you ever buy that?

2135
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:48,569
Why would you even make it like that?

2136
02:18:48,569 --> 02:18:55,290
Plastic? It's cheaper.

2137
02:18:55,290 --> 02:18:59,510
Okay, hold the B button to add minced

2138
02:18:59,510 --> 02:19:01,510
meat. Careful not to tear the skin

2139
02:19:01,510 --> 02:19:03,510
then tilt the Wii mode to twist the sausage

2140
02:19:03,510 --> 02:19:07,219
into links. Is this natural

2141
02:19:07,219 --> 02:19:17,979
casing, mama? I'm trying

2142
02:19:17,979 --> 02:19:19,979
to- I'm tilting the Wii mode.

2143
02:19:19,979 --> 02:19:25,479
How do I cut it?

2144
02:19:25,479 --> 02:19:28,040
How do I tear it?

2145
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:38,899
Okay, got it. Just one

2146
02:19:38,899 --> 02:19:50,870
huge sausage.

2147
02:19:50,870 --> 02:19:53,620
Okay, I messed up one casing.

2148
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:55,620
All right, throw it in a stew. That's how you make everything

2149
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:57,620
in this game. You just boil it.

2150
02:19:57,620 --> 02:20:11,639
Eat on high.

2151
02:20:11,639 --> 02:20:13,639
Boil. Wink. I just did.

2152
02:20:13,639 --> 02:20:21,059
It's just sausages. There's nothing

2153
02:20:21,059 --> 02:20:23,299
else there. This is a house of

2154
02:20:23,299 --> 02:20:26,180
dish.

2155
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:30,659
There's no seasoning.

2156
02:20:30,659 --> 02:20:32,659
Just sausages? That's it?

2157
02:20:32,659 --> 02:20:37,139
It's like some kind of ground up

2158
02:20:37,139 --> 02:20:39,139
stone mustard and lettuce.

2159
02:20:39,139 --> 02:20:42,790
There's nothing else in here. There was no seasoning or anything.

2160
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:48,620
It's just boiled

2161
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:54,309
hot dogs. New recipe.

2162
02:20:54,309 --> 02:20:56,309
This one's from England.

2163
02:20:56,309 --> 02:20:58,309
What's it? English food. Okay.

2164
02:21:00,809 --> 02:21:02,809
Fish and chips! Yep.

2165
02:21:02,809 --> 02:21:24,149
What's it gonna be?

2166
02:21:24,149 --> 02:21:29,590
Toast sandwich?

2167
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:35,590
What does toast sandwich mean?

2168
02:21:39,739 --> 02:21:41,739
UK food is toast.

2169
02:21:41,739 --> 02:21:44,680
Toast? That's it?

2170
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:49,350
That's all they eat in

2171
02:21:49,350 --> 02:21:52,170
England is toast.

2172
02:21:52,170 --> 02:21:54,170
Toast and beans.

2173
02:21:58,969 --> 02:22:01,719
Toast and beans. I actually like

2174
02:22:01,719 --> 02:22:04,020
that. I like

2175
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:06,020
those. I like English beans.

2176
02:22:06,020 --> 02:22:16,579
Slow down! Slow!

2177
02:22:16,579 --> 02:22:55,739
Toast.

2178
02:22:55,739 --> 02:22:59,639
Eat in England.

2179
02:22:59,639 --> 02:23:01,639
He toasts sandwich.

2180
02:23:01,639 --> 02:23:03,639
They just eat toast.

2181
02:23:03,639 --> 02:23:08,379
That was pretty funny.

2182
02:23:08,379 --> 02:23:13,559
That was funny.

2183
02:23:13,559 --> 02:23:15,559
Toast.

2184
02:23:17,559 --> 02:23:19,559
He needs to do

2185
02:23:19,559 --> 02:23:21,989
manscaping?

2186
02:23:21,989 --> 02:23:25,129
Relax! Where?

2187
02:23:25,129 --> 02:23:36,569
Do I have chest hairs?

2188
02:23:36,569 --> 02:23:40,090
Alright, let's make the fish.

2189
02:23:40,090 --> 02:23:42,090
What the fuck? This is not...

2190
02:23:42,090 --> 02:23:44,090
I killed him! I killed him!

2191
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:49,670
Your counter's too small for this,

2192
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:51,670
mama. I'm not gonna filet

2193
02:23:51,670 --> 02:23:53,670
an entire swordfish

2194
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:55,670
in my home kitchen.

2195
02:23:55,670 --> 02:23:57,670
Oh my goodness.

2196
02:23:57,670 --> 02:24:01,059
I thought it was a cob.

2197
02:24:03,239 --> 02:24:05,670
Isn't it like haddock or cod

2198
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:07,670
for fish and chips?

2199
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:19,579
This is an expensive fish and chips.

2200
02:24:19,579 --> 02:24:30,579
Swordfish.

2201
02:24:30,579 --> 02:24:32,579
Why would you fry

2202
02:24:32,579 --> 02:24:34,579
swordfish? Hold on.

2203
02:24:34,579 --> 02:24:36,579
Why would you fry swordfish?

2204
02:24:36,579 --> 02:24:39,459
That's not gonna cook.

2205
02:24:39,459 --> 02:24:42,790
That's gonna be fucked.

2206
02:24:42,790 --> 02:24:44,790
You don't put swordfish

2207
02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:47,799
in a fryer later.

2208
02:24:47,799 --> 02:24:49,799
It's too thin. You can't do that.

2209
02:24:49,799 --> 02:24:54,600
You don't cook

2210
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:59,079
swordfish like this?

2211
02:24:59,079 --> 02:25:01,079
Hey, what are you doing? I'm waiting for the blink.

2212
02:25:01,079 --> 02:25:09,850
I didn't even move, mama.

2213
02:25:09,850 --> 02:25:11,850
Mama, I didn't even fucking move.

2214
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:30,790
Fish and chips with swordfish.

2215
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:36,790
This would be kinda gross.

2216
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:39,799
I don't know if this would work.

2217
02:25:48,250 --> 02:26:02,709
Have you had swordfish before?

2218
02:26:02,709 --> 02:26:04,889
Yeah.

2219
02:26:04,889 --> 02:26:06,889
I like swordfish.

2220
02:26:06,889 --> 02:26:08,889
It's really easy to mess it up though.

2221
02:26:08,889 --> 02:26:11,510
Swordfish is like hard to cook.

2222
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:14,069
Deep fry it.

2223
02:26:14,069 --> 02:26:20,469
This is wrong.

2224
02:26:32,170 --> 02:26:34,170
Take it easy.

2225
02:26:34,170 --> 02:26:36,170
You're not mine.

2226
02:26:36,170 --> 02:26:38,170
That was like $40 gone.

2227
02:26:38,170 --> 02:26:47,639
Take it out!

2228
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:51,860
Watch that heat.

2229
02:26:51,860 --> 02:27:00,379
I'm trying to take it out of the

2230
02:27:00,379 --> 02:27:02,379
bow.

2231
02:27:02,379 --> 02:27:32,819
What is this, potatoes?

2232
02:27:32,819 --> 02:27:34,819
You're gonna get punched.

2233
02:27:40,069 --> 02:27:47,110
Good job.

2234
02:27:47,110 --> 02:27:49,110
I was hitting the fucking side.

2235
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:53,979
Shadow streamer.

2236
02:27:53,979 --> 02:27:55,979
Yeah, I know, I'm in the truck and

2237
02:27:55,979 --> 02:27:57,979
dark.

2238
02:27:57,979 --> 02:27:59,979
We lost to fish and chips.

2239
02:27:59,979 --> 02:28:03,620
Oh, mega lulz.

2240
02:28:03,620 --> 02:28:05,860
America! The United

2241
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:07,860
States of America!

2242
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:09,860
What's on tap from our favorite dish?

2243
02:28:09,860 --> 02:28:22,979
I think it's a little further

2244
02:28:22,979 --> 02:28:51,079
south. I mean, I love

2245
02:28:51,079 --> 02:28:53,260
tacos. Tacos, burritos,

2246
02:28:53,260 --> 02:28:55,260
some of my favorite foods in the

2247
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:57,620
world. But,

2248
02:28:57,620 --> 02:28:59,860
um, like, George Washington

2249
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:03,510
didn't make it up.

2250
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:15,739
I need it.

2251
02:29:15,739 --> 02:29:17,739
Yes, he did. Oh, yeah.

2252
02:29:17,739 --> 02:29:19,739
One of my favorite things George Washington, Ben

2253
02:29:19,739 --> 02:29:21,739
Franklin, one of my favorite things he invented

2254
02:29:21,739 --> 02:29:23,739
was the burrito.

2255
02:29:23,739 --> 02:29:32,889
Are you cooking, are you playing this on 3DS?

2256
02:29:32,889 --> 02:29:38,440
Yes.

2257
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:54,440
Yes. You don't want to be that big,

2258
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:58,280
right? That's good, that's good, that's good too much.

2259
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:01,739
And then you sprinkle all the fucking ingredients

2260
02:30:01,739 --> 02:30:03,739
in there, get them all in there,

2261
02:30:03,739 --> 02:30:05,739
like, what's that thing?

2262
02:30:05,739 --> 02:30:12,010
Is this guy okay?

2263
02:30:22,379 --> 02:30:25,059
Let's make some pan. Ooh!

2264
02:30:25,059 --> 02:30:29,739
Ah, I love this.

2265
02:30:29,739 --> 02:30:33,129
It's so delicious.

2266
02:30:33,129 --> 02:30:35,940
A nice hot tortilla.

2267
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:37,940
Whoa!

2268
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:40,440
I want to eat this. I want

2269
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:42,870
a nice, like, traditional

2270
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:44,870
taco right now. You know what I mean?

2271
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:48,329
With, like, that soft

2272
02:30:48,329 --> 02:30:50,329
like, that soft corn

2273
02:30:50,329 --> 02:30:53,399
tortilla.

2274
02:30:53,399 --> 02:30:55,399
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2275
02:30:55,399 --> 02:30:58,920
See you guys tomorrow.

2276
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:00,920
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2277
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:02,920
I'll be back, I'll see you guys in a little bit.

2278
02:31:17,819 --> 02:31:23,770
Don't you like when I do this?

2279
02:31:23,770 --> 02:31:32,069
Mince. Onion.

2280
02:31:32,069 --> 02:31:34,569
Let's get a little bit of

2281
02:31:34,569 --> 02:31:36,569
cilantro. Maybe some

2282
02:31:36,569 --> 02:31:38,569
carne asada. Oh!

2283
02:31:38,569 --> 02:31:40,569
And a corn tortilla.

2284
02:31:40,569 --> 02:31:42,569
A little bit of green chili sauce.

2285
02:31:42,569 --> 02:31:44,569
Oh my God!

2286
02:31:44,569 --> 02:32:10,940
I'm gonna see, I'm leaving.

2287
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:25,399
The onions are browning?

2288
02:32:25,399 --> 02:32:28,979
Ah, it's alright.

2289
02:32:28,979 --> 02:32:32,760
Dude, why is it a hot dog?

2290
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:34,760
I don't know what this is. My back of my

2291
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:36,760
mouth right now. Right here.

2292
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:38,760
Like, right here.

2293
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:40,760
It's just, it's activating.

2294
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:42,760
It's activating right now.

2295
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:51,659
It's like that, Matt, you know

2296
02:32:51,659 --> 02:32:53,659
like that smell, that taco

2297
02:32:53,659 --> 02:32:55,659
meat smell? It's activating.

2298
02:32:55,659 --> 02:32:57,659
It's like in here, like back here.

2299
02:32:57,659 --> 02:33:02,010
What, are you a toot?

2300
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:04,010
Am I a toot or

2301
02:33:04,010 --> 02:33:06,010
am I a teeth fucking hurt right now?

2302
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:08,010
I gotta go to the dentist.

2303
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:14,280
Is it a lizard? No.

2304
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:16,280
I sound like glands. Yes, my glands

2305
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:19,420
have been activated.

2306
02:33:19,420 --> 02:33:21,420
I just smelled that and it was like

2307
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:23,420
into my nose, into the sinuses.

2308
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:25,420
Activate glands. Glands are now producing

2309
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:27,420
endorphins and serotonin

2310
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:29,420
into my brain. My brain's saying

2311
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:31,420
go get this right now. Put your

2312
02:33:31,420 --> 02:33:33,420
head over the pan to smell. Then that's

2313
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:35,420
going all the way down to my stomach and my stomach goes

2314
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:37,850
bleh. I can't wait.

2315
02:33:37,850 --> 02:33:39,850
I'm getting tacos tonight.

2316
02:33:39,850 --> 02:33:50,860
It's not a joke.

2317
02:33:50,860 --> 02:33:52,860
You have

2318
02:33:52,860 --> 02:33:55,799
salivary glands.

2319
02:33:55,799 --> 02:33:58,680
We can't talk science

2320
02:33:58,680 --> 02:34:00,680
in this chat room? Why not?

2321
02:34:00,680 --> 02:34:09,620
You're a dog.

2322
02:34:09,620 --> 02:34:13,020
I'm being real.

2323
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:23,190
Why do I have such trouble with the lettuce?

2324
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:26,010
I'm just trying to pull. Pull the

2325
02:34:26,010 --> 02:34:29,209
fucking thing.

2326
02:34:29,209 --> 02:34:31,829
I believe science.

2327
02:34:31,829 --> 02:34:33,829
I believe in the science of God.

2328
02:34:33,829 --> 02:34:36,579
Alright, I gotta make this.

2329
02:34:36,579 --> 02:34:38,579
I gotta make my taco.

2330
02:34:38,579 --> 02:34:40,579
Look at that JPEG.

2331
02:34:40,579 --> 02:34:44,870
Ugh.

2332
02:34:44,870 --> 02:34:53,379
Okay.

2333
02:34:53,379 --> 02:34:55,379
We're not at

2334
02:34:55,379 --> 02:34:57,379
Subway. Okay?

2335
02:34:57,379 --> 02:34:59,379
I don't know how many cheese triangles I would

2336
02:34:59,379 --> 02:35:03,610
put in. Okay. Where's the meat?

2337
02:35:03,610 --> 02:35:07,899
Where's the meat?

2338
02:35:07,899 --> 02:35:18,709
Where's the onions?

2339
02:35:18,709 --> 02:35:29,530
Why can't I just put it in?

2340
02:35:29,530 --> 02:35:31,530
That's a joke.

2341
02:35:31,530 --> 02:35:33,530
That's a

2342
02:35:33,530 --> 02:35:35,530
I have a friend that works at Subway.

2343
02:35:35,530 --> 02:35:38,219
And

2344
02:35:38,219 --> 02:35:40,219
I'll give you like six more triangles.

2345
02:35:40,219 --> 02:35:54,420
What am I even

2346
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:57,180
looking at right here?

2347
02:35:57,180 --> 02:35:59,930
I can't even tell what that is.

2348
02:35:59,930 --> 02:36:02,489
Alright, what do we now do?

2349
02:36:02,489 --> 02:36:04,489
Alright, we gotta do this tofu dish.

2350
02:36:04,489 --> 02:36:06,729
No meat.

2351
02:36:06,729 --> 02:36:09,850
Oh my god.

2352
02:36:09,850 --> 02:36:20,329
It's a lot of

2353
02:36:20,329 --> 02:36:23,190
chopping.

2354
02:36:23,190 --> 02:36:25,190
How close am I to the Wii sensor bar?

2355
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:27,190
Umm.

2356
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:30,780
It is right here.

2357
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:32,780
Right there.

2358
02:36:32,780 --> 02:36:34,780
Is that bad? Should I pull back a little?

2359
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:48,979
Tofu.

2360
02:36:48,979 --> 02:36:51,670
The flavored soap

2361
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:54,360
of the culinary world.

2362
02:36:54,360 --> 02:37:05,690
It has radiation.

2363
02:37:05,690 --> 02:37:13,940
Everything. What is all this?

2364
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:15,940
Wasn't I doing tofu?

2365
02:37:15,940 --> 02:37:17,940
This is

2366
02:37:17,940 --> 02:37:20,309
tofu.

2367
02:37:20,309 --> 02:37:22,309
Wait, why

2368
02:37:22,309 --> 02:37:25,319
Wait, this is more

2369
02:37:25,319 --> 02:37:27,319
It's like three times more meat than tofu.

2370
02:37:27,319 --> 02:37:38,329
That's not a cube

2371
02:37:38,329 --> 02:37:40,569
meat. So what, we're doing tofu

2372
02:37:40,569 --> 02:37:42,569
and meat? What kind of meat was that?

2373
02:37:42,569 --> 02:37:47,299
It was minced

2374
02:37:47,299 --> 02:37:52,620
pork. Alright, take that up.

2375
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:55,819
Alright, come on meat.

2376
02:37:55,819 --> 02:38:01,450
Come on, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup.

2377
02:38:01,450 --> 02:38:03,450
Alright, take it up.

2378
02:38:03,450 --> 02:38:07,479
Cutting the meat with the tofu.

2379
02:38:07,479 --> 02:38:13,500
Alright, now stew the

2380
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:20,729
Mapo tofu.

2381
02:38:20,729 --> 02:38:22,729
In goes the spicy miso bean

2382
02:38:22,729 --> 02:38:33,159
sauce. More red chili

2383
02:38:33,159 --> 02:38:35,590
paste. Really crank it.

2384
02:38:35,590 --> 02:38:41,030
Soy sauce.

2385
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:46,659
Let it simmer a little bit.

2386
02:38:46,659 --> 02:38:49,739
And we have white salt. Or is this garlic

2387
02:38:49,739 --> 02:38:51,739
powder? Onion powder? Potato starch.

2388
02:38:51,739 --> 02:38:58,389
I need it.

2389
02:38:58,389 --> 02:39:00,389
I need it.

2390
02:39:00,389 --> 02:39:03,979
What does tofu taste like?

2391
02:39:03,979 --> 02:39:05,979
Whatever you decided to put

2392
02:39:05,979 --> 02:39:08,979
on it. You can make it taste like pretty much

2393
02:39:08,979 --> 02:39:10,979
anything. That's why I said it's

2394
02:39:10,979 --> 02:39:12,979
the flavored soap of the culinary

2395
02:39:12,979 --> 02:39:21,819
world.

2396
02:39:21,819 --> 02:39:23,819
New recipe. Ooh, what are those dumplings?

2397
02:39:23,819 --> 02:39:25,819
I love

2398
02:39:25,819 --> 02:39:27,819
dumplings. I love

2399
02:39:27,819 --> 02:39:29,819
dumplings. I love

2400
02:39:29,819 --> 02:39:32,250
dumplings.

2401
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:34,250
Oh, they're pork buns. Okay. Oh, but still.

2402
02:39:34,250 --> 02:39:37,379
Pork dumplings seriously are

2403
02:39:37,379 --> 02:39:43,270
like, there's this place in

2404
02:39:43,270 --> 02:39:45,270
Paris. I forget the name of the restaurant

2405
02:39:45,270 --> 02:39:47,270
but there's a place in Paris that does, they have

2406
02:39:47,270 --> 02:39:49,270
a park that moves by in Paris.

2407
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:52,540
No, no, no.

2408
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:54,540
Paris Casino in Vegas.

2409
02:39:54,540 --> 02:39:56,540
Not like I went to

2410
02:39:56,540 --> 02:39:58,540
Paris and had steamed pork

2411
02:39:58,540 --> 02:40:00,840
buns.

2412
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:02,840
There's a place in Paris that does

2413
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:04,840
really, really good

2414
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:06,840
steamed dumplings.

2415
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:11,770
Yeah, I got the best

2416
02:40:11,770 --> 02:40:13,770
dumplings ever in Paris, France.

2417
02:40:13,770 --> 02:40:21,190
Dude, I can't.

2418
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:31,879
Rich streamer goes to France.

2419
02:40:31,879 --> 02:40:33,879
No, I went to Pretend France

2420
02:40:33,879 --> 02:40:39,190
in Las Vegas.

2421
02:40:39,190 --> 02:40:41,190
Paris Resort and Casino. They have a

2422
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:43,190
dumpling place. It's pretty good.

2423
02:40:43,190 --> 02:40:45,190
At the dumplings. You have the pork dumplings, the spicy

2424
02:40:45,190 --> 02:40:47,190
pork dumplings. They're fucking phenomenal.

2425
02:40:47,190 --> 02:40:49,500
What's the name of this place?

2426
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:51,500
I say Hash House or Gogo every day.

2427
02:40:51,500 --> 02:41:08,459
Like, I might as well say another one.

2428
02:41:08,459 --> 02:41:10,459
Rich streamer eats out regularly on

2429
02:41:10,459 --> 02:41:17,750
the Las Vegas strip.

2430
02:41:17,750 --> 02:41:19,750
I've been to this place twice in two years.

2431
02:41:19,750 --> 02:41:23,780
It's not expensive.

2432
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:43,290
He's blowing all the bits on dumplings.

2433
02:41:43,290 --> 02:41:46,940
What if I was? What if I was blowing

2434
02:41:46,940 --> 02:41:48,940
all the bits on delicious dumplings?

2435
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:53,159
What if I was?

2436
02:41:53,159 --> 02:41:57,829
Would you rather

2437
02:41:57,829 --> 02:41:59,829
use it on drugs?

2438
02:41:59,829 --> 02:42:03,540
Didn't think so.

2439
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:11,799
Let's make, we're gonna mince this.

2440
02:42:19,350 --> 02:42:25,690
Do a drug test.

2441
02:42:28,309 --> 02:42:30,309
I know a lot of

2442
02:42:30,309 --> 02:42:32,309
people will be like, whoa

2443
02:42:32,309 --> 02:42:34,309
Pog, let's make him do a drug

2444
02:42:34,309 --> 02:42:36,309
test.

2445
02:42:36,309 --> 02:42:38,309
I mean, my

2446
02:42:38,309 --> 02:42:40,309
fucking sodium level might be a little high.

2447
02:42:40,309 --> 02:42:44,340
Nothing on there.

2448
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:46,899
Gonna be a lot of X's.

2449
02:42:46,899 --> 02:42:54,139
My cholesterol might be like slightly

2450
02:42:54,139 --> 02:42:56,139
elevated. I don't know.

2451
02:42:56,139 --> 02:43:09,450
Slightly. I eat pretty healthy guys.

2452
02:43:09,450 --> 02:43:11,450
I don't eat like crap every day.

2453
02:43:11,450 --> 02:43:15,159
I just told you guys

2454
02:43:15,159 --> 02:43:17,159
about one of my favorite snacks.

2455
02:43:17,159 --> 02:43:19,159
It was peanut butter and celery. And everyone was like

2456
02:43:19,159 --> 02:43:21,159
UGH!

2457
02:43:21,159 --> 02:43:23,159
That's like a healthy thing to eat.

2458
02:43:23,159 --> 02:43:28,659
That's not healthy.

2459
02:43:28,659 --> 02:43:35,450
But wait, what year

2460
02:43:35,450 --> 02:43:37,450
is it where peanut butter is not

2461
02:43:37,450 --> 02:43:39,450
seen as a healthy food right now?

2462
02:43:39,450 --> 02:43:41,450
What planet

2463
02:43:41,450 --> 02:43:45,100
are we on? Peanut butter is

2464
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:47,100
you could fucking literally live on peanut butter.

2465
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:49,909
You could eat peanut butter

2466
02:43:49,909 --> 02:43:51,909
and live off of it. It's got everything.

2467
02:43:51,909 --> 02:43:55,750
Peanut butter is very

2468
02:43:55,750 --> 02:44:03,370
It's not a saturated

2469
02:44:03,370 --> 02:44:05,370
fat. You guys, fat is not

2470
02:44:05,370 --> 02:44:07,370
bad. There are good fats.

2471
02:44:07,370 --> 02:44:09,370
All fat is not bad.

2472
02:44:09,370 --> 02:44:26,139
Who told you this?

2473
02:44:26,139 --> 02:44:28,950
Who told you that fat was bad?

2474
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:32,090
Yeah,

2475
02:44:32,090 --> 02:44:34,090
don't drink the fucking grease

2476
02:44:34,090 --> 02:44:36,090
out of the pan when you're done cooking your hamburger.

2477
02:44:36,090 --> 02:44:38,090
But all the unsaturated

2478
02:44:38,090 --> 02:44:40,090
monounsaturated fats are

2479
02:44:40,090 --> 02:44:42,090
are good.

2480
02:44:42,090 --> 02:44:44,260
What doctor are you going to?

2481
02:44:44,260 --> 02:44:56,100
Everybody knows this.

2482
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:58,979
I'm going to fuck

2483
02:44:58,979 --> 02:45:07,430
people fucking with you.

2484
02:45:07,430 --> 02:45:17,219
So many hydrogenated oils. Get the real stuff.

2485
02:45:17,219 --> 02:45:19,219
Imagine being a doctor.

2486
02:45:19,219 --> 02:45:21,219
I'm not a fucking doctor.

2487
02:45:21,219 --> 02:45:23,219
Real peanut butter is good for you.

2488
02:45:23,219 --> 02:45:25,219
What?

2489
02:45:25,219 --> 02:45:27,219
This is not like wow.

2490
02:45:27,219 --> 02:45:30,809
Hold on, I'm going to steam these.

2491
02:45:30,809 --> 02:45:35,530
Turn it off!

2492
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:37,530
Magic cooking was just fucking hard.

2493
02:45:37,530 --> 02:45:39,530
All right, you put it in there for one second

2494
02:45:39,530 --> 02:45:41,530
and turn it off at the exact moment or you're going to burn it.

2495
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:47,930
Idiot doctor.

2496
02:45:47,930 --> 02:45:49,930
Mmm, those look good.

2497
02:45:49,930 --> 02:46:02,069
So you want to see how

2498
02:46:02,069 --> 02:46:04,069
you want to see just how

2499
02:46:04,069 --> 02:46:06,069
ridiculous Earth is right now.

2500
02:46:06,069 --> 02:46:08,069
I hurt my hand, accidentally hit it

2501
02:46:08,069 --> 02:46:10,069
on my desk. You didn't see it. I just typed

2502
02:46:10,069 --> 02:46:12,069
in peanut butter of radiation.

2503
02:46:12,069 --> 02:46:21,399
Let me just shut it off here.

2504
02:46:21,399 --> 02:46:23,399
Are peanuts radioactive and do they cause

2505
02:46:23,399 --> 02:47:01,159
cancer? I had an x-ray

2506
02:47:01,159 --> 02:47:03,159
recently.

2507
02:47:03,159 --> 02:47:06,549
All right.

2508
02:47:06,549 --> 02:47:08,549
I ate like 50,000 bananas.

2509
02:47:08,549 --> 02:47:10,549
For like 200 million bananas.

2510
02:47:10,549 --> 02:47:12,860
I'll never eat

2511
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:20,920
that many bananas in my life.

2512
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:22,920
This is huge.

2513
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:24,920
Wait, is this tofu? Is this a bath towel?

2514
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:36,379
What's my favorite fruit? Kiwis.

2515
02:47:36,379 --> 02:47:38,379
Whoa, I put it on the wiki.

2516
02:47:38,379 --> 02:47:40,379
I didn't know that.

2517
02:47:40,379 --> 02:47:45,819
Wait, I gotta pay for this.

2518
02:47:45,819 --> 02:47:47,819
That's actually kiwis. Kiwis are fucking unbelievable.

2519
02:47:47,819 --> 02:47:49,819
You can't eat a kiwi

2520
02:47:49,819 --> 02:47:51,819
and not like it. It's so sweet.

2521
02:47:51,819 --> 02:47:53,819
When you bite down

2522
02:47:53,819 --> 02:47:55,819
on the seeds, they're a little bit

2523
02:47:55,819 --> 02:47:57,819
chewy. You get that little snap

2524
02:47:57,819 --> 02:47:59,819
on the seeds. Nothing is better

2525
02:47:59,819 --> 02:48:05,829
than that. Yeah, if you know, you

2526
02:48:05,829 --> 02:48:08,579
know. How many do you eat?

2527
02:48:08,579 --> 02:48:15,049
No, I don't eat the skin.

2528
02:48:15,049 --> 02:48:17,049
I don't eat the skin. It's like fuzzy and weird.

2529
02:48:17,049 --> 02:48:26,260
Watermelon? Do we...

2530
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:28,260
Watermelons are pretty good.

2531
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:30,260
Watermelon is almost like a dessert

2532
02:48:30,260 --> 02:48:32,260
fruit, though, because it's just

2533
02:48:32,260 --> 02:48:34,260
water. There's nothing really

2534
02:48:34,260 --> 02:48:36,260
in it. It's just water.

2535
02:48:36,260 --> 02:48:38,260
It's the first word of the fruit.

2536
02:48:38,260 --> 02:48:40,629
I love it. I like watermelon,

2537
02:48:40,629 --> 02:48:42,629
but you're essentially

2538
02:48:42,629 --> 02:48:44,629
breathing air when you eat a watermelon.

2539
02:48:44,629 --> 02:49:03,639
Xiaomian? Oh, I love

2540
02:49:03,639 --> 02:49:06,709
Xiaomian. BRB? I'm gonna

2541
02:49:06,709 --> 02:49:08,709
stick my head in a watermelon. Why?

2542
02:49:08,709 --> 02:49:11,850
Pineapple sucks.

2543
02:49:11,850 --> 02:49:13,850
Pineapple's my second favorite fruit.

2544
02:49:13,850 --> 02:49:15,850
Pineapple has bromelain

2545
02:49:15,850 --> 02:49:17,850
in it. Like, oh my god,

2546
02:49:17,850 --> 02:49:19,850
holy shit, I can't believe this guy knows what that is.

2547
02:49:19,850 --> 02:49:21,850
I thought he was just an idiot.

2548
02:49:21,850 --> 02:49:23,850
I didn't know how to knead dough in Cooking Mama.

2549
02:49:23,850 --> 02:49:25,850
Let's get bromelain in it. It's good for you.

2550
02:49:25,850 --> 02:49:31,909
I don't eat too much pineapple, though,

2551
02:49:31,909 --> 02:49:33,909
because the same thing that's good for you

2552
02:49:33,909 --> 02:49:35,909
actually is like a flesh-eating enzyme.

2553
02:49:35,909 --> 02:49:39,370
I don't eat too much, just enough.

2554
02:49:39,370 --> 02:49:44,489
Ooh. Oh!

2555
02:49:44,489 --> 02:49:50,549
Do it! Dude,

2556
02:49:50,549 --> 02:49:54,389
this is sick!

2557
02:49:54,389 --> 02:50:04,440
Why is it all going onto the floor?

2558
02:50:04,440 --> 02:50:06,440
Granny Smith apples to guard here. Green

2559
02:50:06,440 --> 02:50:08,440
apples. Green apples are better than red

2560
02:50:08,440 --> 02:50:12,409
apples. Pax! Just hit

2561
02:50:12,409 --> 02:50:16,379
right here. Yep. Xiaomian?

2562
02:50:16,379 --> 02:50:24,569
Macintosh apples are better

2563
02:50:24,569 --> 02:50:26,569
than both of them combined.

2564
02:50:26,569 --> 02:50:28,569
No, no, no, no, no.

2565
02:50:28,569 --> 02:50:30,569
I'll throw the axe.

2566
02:50:30,569 --> 02:50:32,569
Like, that was wrong.

2567
02:50:32,569 --> 02:50:35,000
Macintosh apples are better than

2568
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Granny Smith apples, but

2569
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
green apples are

2570
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
better than Macintosh apples.

2571
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Okay, that's better.

2572
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:46,010
I love the little soft

2573
02:50:46,010 --> 02:50:48,010
Macintosh apples. You can just eat them.

2574
02:50:48,010 --> 02:50:50,010
They're so...

2575
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:52,010
The flesh is so mushy and so

2576
02:50:52,010 --> 02:50:54,010
easy to bite through. I don't like eating

2577
02:50:54,010 --> 02:50:56,010
apples because I have to cut them up and

2578
02:50:56,010 --> 02:50:58,010
carve them up and shit.

2579
02:50:58,010 --> 02:51:00,010
I want to eat it with my hand. And a lot of times

2580
02:51:00,010 --> 02:51:02,010
when I eat an apple, it's like...

2581
02:51:02,010 --> 02:51:04,250
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

2582
02:51:04,250 --> 02:51:06,250
This hurts. This hurts.

2583
02:51:06,250 --> 02:51:08,250
And I use my

2584
02:51:08,250 --> 02:51:10,250
bottom fucking teeth to go in harder.

2585
02:51:10,250 --> 02:51:12,250
It hurts. I don't want to do that.

2586
02:51:12,250 --> 02:51:19,610
Curry. Ooh, nice.

2587
02:51:19,610 --> 02:51:23,379
I see a dentist. My teeth are in fucking

2588
02:51:23,379 --> 02:51:26,260
perfect condition.

2589
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:28,260
You want my teeth? You want my x-rays from my dentist?

2590
02:51:28,260 --> 02:51:44,709
It's like releasing your

2591
02:51:44,709 --> 02:51:46,709
tax returns. Let's see the x-rays of your

2592
02:51:46,709 --> 02:51:49,079
teeth. Let's see your teeth

2593
02:51:49,079 --> 02:51:51,079
returns.

2594
02:51:55,819 --> 02:51:57,819
Alright, let's grate that cheese.

2595
02:51:57,819 --> 02:52:01,899
Ginger or

2596
02:52:01,899 --> 02:52:03,899
ginseng or whatever it is.

2597
02:52:05,899 --> 02:52:12,489
If Kim was in the room right now,

2598
02:52:12,489 --> 02:52:14,489
she would be doing the thing

2599
02:52:14,489 --> 02:52:16,489
I was doing when I was making

2600
02:52:16,489 --> 02:52:18,489
the tacos onto the spring.

2601
02:52:18,489 --> 02:52:20,489
She'd be going, oh my god,

2602
02:52:20,489 --> 02:52:22,489
yes! Oh, look at that!

2603
02:52:22,489 --> 02:52:24,489
Kim loves curry.

2604
02:52:37,239 --> 02:52:41,510
Does she like curry?

2605
02:52:41,510 --> 02:52:43,510
Yeah, I guess.

2606
02:52:46,520 --> 02:52:48,760
Alright, let's put it together.

2607
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:53,180
Fruit tier list? I already did it.

2608
02:52:53,180 --> 02:52:57,659
I did a fruit tier list.

2609
02:52:59,659 --> 02:53:02,920
Human.

2610
02:53:02,920 --> 02:53:09,370
Remake it?

2611
02:53:09,370 --> 02:53:22,299
I'm not going to remake

2612
02:53:22,299 --> 02:53:25,049
the list. Oh shit, I can do this!

2613
02:53:25,049 --> 02:53:29,270
I'll put the cinnamon in it.

2614
02:53:29,270 --> 02:53:42,309
I didn't know I could do that. Get it in the stew.

2615
02:53:42,309 --> 02:53:50,040
Are you depressed?

2616
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:53,239
No, I just, okay.

2617
02:53:53,239 --> 02:53:55,239
I have deep set eyes.

2618
02:53:55,239 --> 02:53:57,540
Okay, sorry.

2619
02:53:57,540 --> 02:53:59,540
Dude, are you angry? Is something

2620
02:53:59,540 --> 02:54:01,540
wrong? Why do you look like you're going

2621
02:54:01,540 --> 02:54:03,540
to swing at me? I have deep

2622
02:54:03,540 --> 02:54:06,360
set eyes. I can't, what?

2623
02:54:06,360 --> 02:54:16,600
That's what it is.

2624
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:18,600
There's a shadow cast over my eyes forever.

2625
02:54:18,600 --> 02:54:21,739
And it just makes me

2626
02:54:21,739 --> 02:54:23,739
look villainous because there's a shadow here

2627
02:54:23,739 --> 02:54:25,979
because of the lighting. If you see me out

2628
02:54:25,979 --> 02:54:27,979
in person, I look happy.

2629
02:54:27,979 --> 02:54:31,110
I have deep set eyes.

2630
02:54:31,110 --> 02:54:40,700
Why do you stream in the dark?

2631
02:54:40,700 --> 02:54:45,110
Do we have to talk about this

2632
02:54:45,110 --> 02:54:47,110
every stream?

2633
02:54:47,110 --> 02:54:49,110
I start the stream during the day

2634
02:54:49,110 --> 02:54:51,420
and during the night time,

2635
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:53,420
if I have my webcams

2636
02:54:53,420 --> 02:54:55,420
gain up, I'll get blown out.

2637
02:54:55,420 --> 02:55:03,159
Why do we have to keep

2638
02:55:03,159 --> 02:55:05,159
explaining this? And I don't use auto.

2639
02:55:05,159 --> 02:55:13,860
This looks much better?

2640
02:55:13,860 --> 02:55:23,909
I disagree. Nice chest tier.

2641
02:55:23,909 --> 02:55:25,909
I was going to give the finger to the camera,

2642
02:55:25,909 --> 02:55:27,909
but I decided not to.

2643
02:55:27,909 --> 02:55:29,909
Because it would be used against me.

2644
02:55:29,909 --> 02:55:38,409
Alright, I fuck

2645
02:55:38,409 --> 02:55:40,780
this up every time.

2646
02:55:40,780 --> 02:55:42,780
Slowly pour it, right?

2647
02:55:42,780 --> 02:55:44,780
Slowly pour it out, right?

2648
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:47,340
Okay, slowly pour it.

2649
02:55:47,340 --> 02:56:02,739
We have to

2650
02:56:02,739 --> 02:56:04,979
bake it? Steam the rice.

2651
02:56:04,979 --> 02:56:26,409
Let's go.

2652
02:56:26,409 --> 02:56:28,409
What do I think of Cadbury Eggs?

2653
02:56:28,409 --> 02:56:32,299
I'll tell you.

2654
02:56:54,139 --> 02:57:01,120
You've never seen the commercial?

2655
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:04,639
Oh, right. Because

2656
02:57:04,639 --> 02:57:07,010
you have not seen that.

2657
02:57:07,010 --> 02:57:09,010
Right. Cadbury Eggs had a commercial

2658
02:57:09,010 --> 02:57:11,010
with a bunny rabbit that did a chicken sound

2659
02:57:11,010 --> 02:57:13,010
like that. Exactly like that?

2660
02:57:13,010 --> 02:57:18,049
Um, okay.

2661
02:57:18,049 --> 02:57:20,049
I forget that I'm probably 20 years older than half

2662
02:57:20,049 --> 02:57:22,049
the people in this chat room.

2663
02:57:22,049 --> 02:57:24,739
Sometimes I forget.

2664
02:57:34,229 --> 02:57:36,229
I'm 25. I never saw that.

2665
02:57:36,229 --> 02:57:38,729
I'm still 10 years older than you.

2666
02:57:38,729 --> 02:57:41,420
I'm a decade older than you. Think about that.

2667
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:43,909
I'm 10 years older than you.

2668
02:57:43,909 --> 02:57:45,909
Look at the wisdom

2669
02:57:45,909 --> 02:57:52,059
that I have that you don't.

2670
02:57:52,059 --> 02:57:55,899
Wait, didn't I just make this?

2671
02:57:55,899 --> 02:58:02,809
Am I making this?

2672
02:58:02,809 --> 02:58:05,559
Am I remaking this?

2673
02:58:05,559 --> 02:58:07,559
I'm doing it. I'm doing it again.

2674
02:58:07,559 --> 02:58:10,120
This is a different one. Okay.

2675
02:58:23,219 --> 02:58:25,219
Okay, the lamb curry.

2676
02:58:25,219 --> 02:58:32,379
Let's cut it up into pieces.

2677
02:58:32,379 --> 02:58:34,379
I love that sound. That like

2678
02:58:34,379 --> 02:58:40,719
shwoop, shwoop.

2679
02:58:40,719 --> 02:58:42,719
What happened to Chibi-Robo?

2680
02:58:44,719 --> 02:58:46,719
I got pushed to tomorrow.

2681
02:58:46,719 --> 02:58:51,069
The disc was broken.

2682
02:58:51,069 --> 02:58:53,069
I had to return it.

2683
02:58:53,069 --> 02:58:55,069
Like, I got a fucking broken disc.

2684
02:58:55,069 --> 02:58:57,069
I don't know what happened inside the way it broke.

2685
02:59:01,379 --> 02:59:03,379
Actually, I'll be honest with you.

2686
02:59:03,379 --> 02:59:05,379
I've got to make sure I prepare that.

2687
02:59:05,379 --> 02:59:08,319
I've got to get that ready to go.

2688
02:59:08,319 --> 02:59:10,319
There cannot be any fucking

2689
02:59:10,319 --> 02:59:12,319
mistakes there.

2690
02:59:12,319 --> 02:59:14,319
I will make sure that that's what we're doing

2691
02:59:14,319 --> 02:59:19,309
tomorrow. No matter what.

2692
02:59:19,309 --> 02:59:21,309
The SD card is a couple of options.

2693
02:59:21,309 --> 02:59:23,309
I just didn't want to do it like in the middle of the stream.

2694
02:59:23,309 --> 02:59:25,309
Like, I would have fucked something up and it would have been bad.

2695
02:59:25,309 --> 02:59:42,139
Give me another one. Another bullseye.

2696
02:59:42,139 --> 02:59:48,930
Rage, quit Chibi-Robo.

2697
02:59:48,930 --> 02:59:50,930
Cook, not gonna lie. You'll be

2698
02:59:50,930 --> 02:59:53,940
vibing. So I'm just gonna give 20

2699
02:59:53,940 --> 02:59:57,069
subs. Knock, turn.

2700
02:59:57,069 --> 02:59:59,569
Knock, turn.

2701
02:59:59,569 --> 03:00:01,569
Thanks for the 20 community subs.

2702
03:00:01,569 --> 03:00:03,569
Knock, turn.

2703
03:00:03,569 --> 03:00:06,829
Tak-ta-turn.

2704
03:00:06,829 --> 03:00:10,290
Knock, turn. Act-ta-turn.

2705
03:00:10,290 --> 03:00:12,530
Thank you. That's a fucking...

2706
03:00:12,530 --> 03:00:16,299
No problem.

2707
03:00:16,299 --> 03:00:18,670
That's a lot of subs. Thank you.

2708
03:00:18,670 --> 03:00:20,670
Congratulations to those that got the community

2709
03:00:20,670 --> 03:00:23,170
subs. Knock, turn.

2710
03:00:23,170 --> 03:00:28,540
Tax return?

2711
03:00:28,540 --> 03:00:31,549
What a god. People drop huge

2712
03:00:31,549 --> 03:00:33,549
sub-gifts in here.

2713
03:00:33,549 --> 03:00:35,549
This is kind of crazy.

2714
03:00:35,549 --> 03:00:39,899
Laurel? What is Laurel?

2715
03:00:39,899 --> 03:00:52,370
What is Laurel?

2716
03:00:52,370 --> 03:00:54,670
Yanny? What is a Yanny?

2717
03:00:54,670 --> 03:00:57,620
What are you guys all saying?

2718
03:00:57,620 --> 03:01:00,879
What are you guys doing? What is this?

2719
03:01:00,879 --> 03:01:07,920
What is a Yanny?

2720
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:09,920
He's pretending. I don't know what

2721
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:11,920
that is. I don't know what

2722
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:13,920
Yanny is.

2723
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:20,319
It's a joke.

2724
03:01:20,319 --> 03:01:22,319
It's how I'm pretending.

2725
03:01:22,319 --> 03:01:24,940
I don't know what...

2726
03:01:24,940 --> 03:01:26,940
I'm not pretending. I don't know what that is.

2727
03:01:26,940 --> 03:01:29,250
Do you

2728
03:01:29,250 --> 03:01:33,280
live under a rock?

2729
03:01:33,280 --> 03:01:35,280
I live technically under wood.

2730
03:01:35,280 --> 03:01:46,139
Hot ass.

2731
03:01:46,139 --> 03:01:49,659
I don't know what that is.

2732
03:01:49,659 --> 03:01:55,620
Oh, he's a wise guy.

2733
03:01:55,620 --> 03:02:00,659
He knows it sucks.

2734
03:02:00,659 --> 03:02:06,670
I...

2735
03:02:06,670 --> 03:02:08,670
Yeah, it sucks. Whatever.

2736
03:02:08,670 --> 03:02:10,670
I remember watching it when I was younger.

2737
03:02:10,670 --> 03:02:12,670
How am I going to make

2738
03:02:12,670 --> 03:02:14,670
this little doll up into something huge?

2739
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:34,750
This is my favorite

2740
03:02:34,750 --> 03:02:36,750
game. I did not know he was playing it.

2741
03:02:36,750 --> 03:02:38,750
How did I not know I was... Well, because we had to pivot.

2742
03:02:38,750 --> 03:02:40,750
We had to do a hard pivot

2743
03:02:40,750 --> 03:02:42,750
in this game. This is not something

2744
03:02:42,750 --> 03:02:45,250
I planned on doing today.

2745
03:02:45,250 --> 03:02:47,250
But you're probably really happy to see that it's here.

2746
03:02:47,250 --> 03:02:53,010
Cilantro,

2747
03:02:53,010 --> 03:02:55,010
carne asada, green chili sauce.

2748
03:02:55,010 --> 03:02:57,010
Oh, yep.

2749
03:02:57,010 --> 03:02:59,010
We're good.

2750
03:03:06,500 --> 03:03:08,500
Cilantro tastes like soap.

2751
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:10,500
If you use

2752
03:03:10,500 --> 03:03:12,500
too much of it, I agree with you. I don't like a lot

2753
03:03:12,500 --> 03:03:14,500
of cilantro. I like just enough to get a little bit

2754
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:18,979
of that flavor.

2755
03:03:18,979 --> 03:03:20,979
Too much

2756
03:03:20,979 --> 03:03:22,979
cilantro just doesn't taste

2757
03:03:22,979 --> 03:03:32,190
great. My father hates

2758
03:03:32,190 --> 03:03:34,750
cilantro. If my father's even in

2759
03:03:34,750 --> 03:03:36,750
the same room as cilantro, he will

2760
03:03:36,750 --> 03:03:45,389
throw up. Did I do them all?

2761
03:03:48,209 --> 03:03:52,180
What's left?

2762
03:03:52,180 --> 03:03:54,180
Holy shit, there's a whole page I didn't do. The cream puffs!

2763
03:03:54,180 --> 03:03:56,180
What am I thinking? I didn't do the cream puff.

2764
03:03:56,180 --> 03:04:09,680
Cream puffs with ice cream

2765
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:12,180
are better than cream puffs with the cream.

2766
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:19,920
Is that, um, accurate for a lot of you guys?

2767
03:04:19,920 --> 03:04:24,379
That's wrong?

2768
03:04:24,379 --> 03:04:31,100
That's okay. Is it soggy?

2769
03:04:31,100 --> 03:04:33,100
Well, you have to eat it right away. You gotta eat it right away.

2770
03:04:33,100 --> 03:04:41,739
Stew?

2771
03:04:41,739 --> 03:04:44,750
Oh, we're making sugar?

2772
03:04:44,750 --> 03:04:47,569
Oh my god, vomit

2773
03:04:47,569 --> 03:04:57,040
father. I thought we were over

2774
03:04:57,040 --> 03:05:01,200
that. Vomit father.

2775
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:08,860
That's a lot of butter. I don't

2776
03:05:08,860 --> 03:05:12,899
even know what to say.

2777
03:05:12,899 --> 03:05:17,629
It makes me cry! Just eat

2778
03:05:17,629 --> 03:05:19,629
butter. Vomit father.

2779
03:05:19,629 --> 03:05:21,629
Why is there an egg going in

2780
03:05:21,629 --> 03:05:26,049
here?

2781
03:05:26,049 --> 03:05:33,659
What is this?

2782
03:05:33,659 --> 03:05:38,530
Local streamers afraid of butter?

2783
03:05:38,530 --> 03:05:41,280
It's custard, dummy.

2784
03:05:41,280 --> 03:05:43,280
Well, get away from me, because I go violent!

2785
03:05:43,280 --> 03:05:48,270
Oh, I can't, okay.

2786
03:05:48,270 --> 03:05:50,270
I finished, I fucking, I can't.

2787
03:05:50,270 --> 03:05:52,270
I have ADHD.

2788
03:05:52,270 --> 03:05:54,270
Let's use that as an excuse for literally everything

2789
03:05:54,270 --> 03:05:56,829
I've ever done in my whole, my entire life.

2790
03:05:56,829 --> 03:06:08,399
Okay, good.

2791
03:06:08,399 --> 03:06:10,399
Now do it like this.

2792
03:06:15,459 --> 03:06:18,079
Jeremy!

2793
03:06:18,079 --> 03:06:20,579
Blah blah!

2794
03:06:20,579 --> 03:06:32,079
He's snapping all the time.

2795
03:06:34,379 --> 03:06:36,379
I don't give a shit.

2796
03:06:36,379 --> 03:06:48,100
Alright.

2797
03:06:48,100 --> 03:06:50,530
Turn off!

2798
03:06:50,530 --> 03:06:52,700
Do it that quick.

2799
03:06:52,700 --> 03:06:54,700
Oh, he will. He will.

2800
03:06:54,700 --> 03:07:00,209
Anything can be...

2801
03:07:00,209 --> 03:07:02,209
We've seen like five to ten different deepfakes

2802
03:07:02,209 --> 03:07:04,209
at this point. Do you think I really care?

2803
03:07:04,209 --> 03:07:06,209
Do you think I'm at the point right now

2804
03:07:06,209 --> 03:07:08,209
where I'm like, man, I really hope they don't like

2805
03:07:08,209 --> 03:07:10,209
put me in something that I'm not

2806
03:07:10,209 --> 03:07:12,209
in? Not right now!

2807
03:07:12,209 --> 03:07:20,139
What's Jello made of?

2808
03:07:20,139 --> 03:07:24,940
I don't know.

2809
03:07:24,940 --> 03:07:29,229
Bones.

2810
03:07:29,229 --> 03:07:48,750
Jelly, on the other hand. Why would you

2811
03:07:48,750 --> 03:07:51,819
do it like this?

2812
03:07:51,819 --> 03:07:57,139
What the fuck?

2813
03:07:57,139 --> 03:07:59,139
Only one egg? I can't try again?

2814
03:07:59,139 --> 03:08:12,899
It's wasting.

2815
03:08:12,899 --> 03:08:14,899
It was implied that she's just doing it for me.

2816
03:08:14,899 --> 03:08:19,059
What's the difference between jam and jelly?

2817
03:08:19,059 --> 03:08:21,059
Tons of differences.

2818
03:08:21,059 --> 03:08:23,059
A fucking huge amount of differences.

2819
03:08:23,059 --> 03:08:25,059
But we're not going to get into them today.

2820
03:08:25,059 --> 03:08:51,360
Jelly is based...

2821
03:08:51,360 --> 03:08:53,360
It's just based Jello.

2822
03:08:53,360 --> 03:09:07,760
What are you talking about?

2823
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:14,459
Vanilla extract.

2824
03:09:14,459 --> 03:09:16,770
Can't that stuff kill you?

2825
03:09:16,770 --> 03:09:19,459
If you have too much vanilla extract,

2826
03:09:19,459 --> 03:09:28,350
can it kill you?

2827
03:09:28,350 --> 03:09:32,129
Anything can kill you. Yeah.

2828
03:09:32,129 --> 03:09:34,129
Probably. If you chug it...

2829
03:09:34,129 --> 03:09:36,129
No, it's like straight alcohol, right?

2830
03:09:36,129 --> 03:09:38,129
It's very bad.

2831
03:09:38,129 --> 03:09:40,129
Hold the B button to squeeze the cream

2832
03:09:40,129 --> 03:09:42,129
onto the pastry. Be careful!

2833
03:09:42,129 --> 03:09:44,620
Alright, let's do it.

2834
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:54,979
I don't know what you're talking about,

2835
03:09:54,979 --> 03:09:56,979
Mama.

2836
03:09:56,979 --> 03:09:58,979
This is how me and my family

2837
03:09:58,979 --> 03:10:15,229
like it.

2838
03:10:15,229 --> 03:10:17,659
That one in the top row, I would grab it immediately.

2839
03:10:17,659 --> 03:10:21,500
Too much cream?

2840
03:10:21,500 --> 03:10:24,379
I don't think this is actually a sentence

2841
03:10:24,379 --> 03:10:26,379
that makes sense when you say that.

2842
03:10:26,379 --> 03:10:31,379
Too much cream in your cream-filled

2843
03:10:31,379 --> 03:10:33,379
pastry. I don't know about that.

2844
03:10:33,379 --> 03:10:44,290
Ooh! What's that one?

2845
03:10:44,290 --> 03:10:46,290
Ooh, lasagna. My least favorite

2846
03:10:46,290 --> 03:10:48,290
Italian delight.

2847
03:10:48,290 --> 03:10:50,850
Dessert. Whatever.

2848
03:10:50,850 --> 03:10:52,850
My least favorite Italian

2849
03:10:52,850 --> 03:10:54,850
fantastic food.

2850
03:10:54,850 --> 03:11:05,200
Lasagna.

2851
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:07,200
Actually, I don't like it.

2852
03:11:07,200 --> 03:11:09,440
Those of you that might be new

2853
03:11:09,440 --> 03:11:12,260
viewers,

2854
03:11:12,260 --> 03:11:14,260
I'll eat lasagna, but I don't really...

2855
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:16,260
I would choose not to eat lasagna.

2856
03:11:16,260 --> 03:11:23,680
To me, it's kind of...

2857
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:25,979
I don't know. It's kind of boring.

2858
03:11:25,979 --> 03:11:28,540
It kind of bores me.

2859
03:11:30,540 --> 03:11:32,540
Do you like spaghetti and meatballs?

2860
03:11:32,540 --> 03:11:35,809
Yeah, I do, but

2861
03:11:35,809 --> 03:11:37,809
lasagna is...

2862
03:11:37,809 --> 03:11:39,809
It's always like

2863
03:11:39,809 --> 03:11:41,809
mushes together.

2864
03:11:41,809 --> 03:11:43,809
It's usually like a meat sauce

2865
03:11:43,809 --> 03:11:45,809
and just layers of this

2866
03:11:45,809 --> 03:11:47,809
pasta sheets, and you take your fork

2867
03:11:47,809 --> 03:11:49,809
and just mush through it.

2868
03:11:49,809 --> 03:11:51,809
I don't know. I'm not...

2869
03:11:51,809 --> 03:11:53,809
I'll eat it. I don't hate it.

2870
03:11:53,809 --> 03:11:55,809
But I wouldn't order it.

2871
03:11:55,809 --> 03:11:58,180
It just doesn't do it for me.

2872
03:11:58,180 --> 03:12:01,250
It's like a spaghetti cake.

2873
03:12:01,250 --> 03:12:03,250
That's a good way to put it.

2874
03:12:03,250 --> 03:12:08,559
Do you like balsamic vinegar?

2875
03:12:08,559 --> 03:12:10,559
No.

2876
03:12:10,559 --> 03:12:12,559
I don't.

2877
03:12:12,559 --> 03:12:14,559
I actually don't.

2878
03:12:14,559 --> 03:12:19,299
I love olive oil, though.

2879
03:12:19,299 --> 03:12:21,299
It's like one of my favorite things on Earth.

2880
03:12:25,709 --> 03:12:30,700
That I can't stand by.

2881
03:12:30,700 --> 03:12:41,329
Why not?

2882
03:12:41,329 --> 03:12:43,329
A really good EVOO just dumped on top

2883
03:12:43,329 --> 03:12:47,170
of hummus. I could eat that every day

2884
03:12:47,170 --> 03:12:49,170
and be happy. You could just put me into a room

2885
03:12:49,170 --> 03:12:51,170
and have a fridge

2886
03:12:51,170 --> 03:12:53,170
in there, and in that fridge was just a ton of

2887
03:12:53,170 --> 03:12:55,170
just garlic hummuses,

2888
03:12:55,170 --> 03:12:57,170
some pita bread to the right, just like

2889
03:12:57,170 --> 03:12:59,170
hundreds of bags of it, and then

2890
03:12:59,170 --> 03:13:01,170
like 30 bottles of EVOO.

2891
03:13:01,170 --> 03:13:04,049
And you'd think like you were

2892
03:13:04,049 --> 03:13:06,049
torturing me, and I would be like, no, this is perfect.

2893
03:13:06,049 --> 03:13:08,049
Thanks. See you in a

2894
03:13:08,049 --> 03:13:10,049
fucking couple months when I want more of this.

2895
03:13:24,129 --> 03:13:29,180
Mr. Virgin olive oil.

2896
03:13:29,180 --> 03:13:33,280
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

2897
03:13:33,280 --> 03:13:35,280
Do I have an irritation under here or something? What's going on?

2898
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:37,280
I'm a little irritated under here.

2899
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:46,879
Why?

2900
03:13:46,879 --> 03:13:48,879
A mold rash.

2901
03:13:48,879 --> 03:14:03,219
EVOO.

2902
03:14:03,219 --> 03:14:05,219
Extra virgin olive oil.

2903
03:14:05,219 --> 03:14:07,780
Oh, I can taste it already.

2904
03:14:07,780 --> 03:14:11,420
So many foods.

2905
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:13,420
I love food.

2906
03:14:13,420 --> 03:14:15,790
I'm a really

2907
03:14:15,790 --> 03:14:17,790
food motivated person.

2908
03:14:17,790 --> 03:14:30,340
You're a dog.

2909
03:14:30,340 --> 03:14:39,680
Says the man that doesn't eat lasagna.

2910
03:14:39,680 --> 03:14:41,680
Yeah, I have my different preferences,

2911
03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:43,680
but I love food.

2912
03:14:46,370 --> 03:14:49,299
You don't look like it.

2913
03:14:49,299 --> 03:14:53,969
I

2914
03:14:53,969 --> 03:14:55,969
really love food.

2915
03:14:55,969 --> 03:14:57,969
I never said I like to eat

2916
03:14:57,969 --> 03:14:59,969
too much of it every day.

2917
03:14:59,969 --> 03:15:02,459
When did I say I love food?

2918
03:15:02,459 --> 03:15:04,459
And I love eating way more than I'm

2919
03:15:04,459 --> 03:15:06,459
supposed to. Every day.

2920
03:15:06,459 --> 03:15:08,459
Well, I didn't say that.

2921
03:15:08,459 --> 03:15:12,370
Get that butter in there.

2922
03:15:12,370 --> 03:15:14,370
Hold on, guys.

2923
03:15:14,370 --> 03:15:24,860
Not ideal.

2924
03:15:24,860 --> 03:15:28,299
They're struck a nerve

2925
03:15:28,299 --> 03:15:31,500
there.

2926
03:15:31,500 --> 03:15:33,500
McDonald's?

2927
03:15:33,500 --> 03:15:37,540
I like McDonald's.

2928
03:15:37,540 --> 03:15:39,709
Onions.

2929
03:15:39,709 --> 03:15:50,510
All right.

2930
03:15:50,510 --> 03:15:58,000
Perfect timing.

2931
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:02,610
Onions.

2932
03:16:02,610 --> 03:16:10,209
McDonald's is good.

2933
03:16:10,209 --> 03:16:12,209
If you say that McDonald's sucks,

2934
03:16:12,209 --> 03:16:14,209
you're probably smart.

2935
03:16:14,209 --> 03:16:16,209
You probably have a lot of intelligence

2936
03:16:16,209 --> 03:16:18,209
and your brain is huge.

2937
03:16:18,209 --> 03:16:23,329
I mean, come on.

2938
03:16:23,329 --> 03:16:25,329
For the rest of us, dumb fucking idiots.

2939
03:16:25,329 --> 03:16:27,329
You only eat McDonald's if you're

2940
03:16:27,329 --> 03:16:29,329
a fucking moron. For all of us other idiots.

2941
03:16:29,329 --> 03:16:31,329
I think it's

2942
03:16:31,329 --> 03:16:33,329
good. I like it.

2943
03:16:33,329 --> 03:16:42,670
I don't eat it all the time.

2944
03:16:42,670 --> 03:16:45,489
Here we go.

2945
03:16:45,489 --> 03:16:47,489
Idiot crew.

2946
03:16:47,489 --> 03:16:55,229
The idiot move is not going to Wendy's.

2947
03:16:55,229 --> 03:16:57,229
They're all good.

2948
03:16:57,229 --> 03:16:59,229
You just feel like them sometimes.

2949
03:16:59,229 --> 03:17:01,229
You go on a stint where you want one

2950
03:17:01,229 --> 03:17:03,229
of a month's rate.

2951
03:17:03,229 --> 03:17:05,229
And you don't want the other one.

2952
03:17:05,229 --> 03:17:12,020
Tomatoes, though.

2953
03:17:12,020 --> 03:17:17,069
Wendy's is dog shit.

2954
03:17:17,069 --> 03:17:19,069
No, I

2955
03:17:19,069 --> 03:17:21,069
ate it too much. So I'm just sick of

2956
03:17:21,069 --> 03:17:23,069
eating it. All right. Time to make

2957
03:17:23,069 --> 03:17:25,069
some lasagna. Memorize the example.

2958
03:17:25,069 --> 03:17:27,760
First,

2959
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:29,760
a point of degree. First, a point to add the ingredients in the same

2960
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:35,139
order. Make it in the same

2961
03:17:35,139 --> 03:17:38,079
order. All right.

2962
03:17:38,079 --> 03:17:40,379
Mushrooms, meat,

2963
03:17:40,379 --> 03:17:48,049
sheet.

2964
03:17:48,049 --> 03:17:50,049
Meat, sheet, mushrooms.

2965
03:17:50,049 --> 03:17:57,340
What is all that on top?

2966
03:17:57,340 --> 03:18:01,379
All right.

2967
03:18:01,379 --> 03:18:03,379
Meat, mushroom, sheet,

2968
03:18:03,379 --> 03:18:07,790
sheet.

2969
03:18:07,790 --> 03:18:09,790
That lasagna is terrible.

2970
03:18:09,790 --> 03:18:13,120
That's a true mess up.

2971
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:15,120
Sheet, meat, mushroom,

2972
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:17,549
sheet, sheet.

2973
03:18:17,549 --> 03:18:19,549
Sheet, meat, mushroom, sheet,

2974
03:18:19,549 --> 03:18:21,549
meat, mushroom, sheet, sheet.

2975
03:18:21,549 --> 03:18:29,020
Holy shit.

2976
03:18:29,020 --> 03:18:33,120
All right.

2977
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:35,940
Put it in the oven.

2978
03:18:35,940 --> 03:18:37,940
We're going to cook this slow.

2979
03:18:37,940 --> 03:18:40,180
Slow.

2980
03:18:40,180 --> 03:18:47,149
Five degrees.

2981
03:18:47,149 --> 03:18:51,059
Looks like banana bread.

2982
03:18:51,059 --> 03:19:03,969
A lot of very good. Got something new.

2983
03:19:03,969 --> 03:19:06,399
This is a new dish.

2984
03:19:06,399 --> 03:19:08,700
Ooh.

2985
03:19:08,700 --> 03:19:12,590
Pumpkin.

2986
03:19:12,590 --> 03:19:15,540
Grilled bonito.

2987
03:19:15,540 --> 03:19:18,670
Hand fried lobster.

2988
03:19:18,670 --> 03:19:21,170
Let's do the bonito.

2989
03:19:25,950 --> 03:19:27,950
Gotta dice up the fish. What kind of fish is it?

2990
03:19:27,950 --> 03:19:29,950
It's a bonito.

2991
03:19:29,950 --> 03:19:52,270
Filet-o.

2992
03:19:52,270 --> 03:19:54,270
Head. Oh, sad face. His head.

2993
03:19:57,649 --> 03:19:59,649
He's slaughtering a fish.

2994
03:19:59,649 --> 03:20:14,500
Why are there four different salts?

2995
03:20:14,500 --> 03:20:16,739
I don't know.

2996
03:20:16,739 --> 03:20:18,739
It's like

2997
03:20:18,739 --> 03:20:20,739
sea salt and Himalayan

2998
03:20:20,739 --> 03:20:22,739
pink salt.

2999
03:20:22,739 --> 03:20:26,000
Deep salt. I don't know.

3000
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:28,000
There's a lot of different salts.

3001
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:31,969
Grill.

3002
03:20:31,969 --> 03:20:33,969
We didn't have the grill yet.

3003
03:20:33,969 --> 03:20:35,969
Hold the fan with the B button and wave it to increase

3004
03:20:35,969 --> 03:20:58,750
the heat.

3005
03:20:58,750 --> 03:21:00,750
How do I flip it?

3006
03:21:00,750 --> 03:21:02,750
Turn it over.

3007
03:21:02,750 --> 03:21:15,870
That looks pretty good.

3008
03:21:15,870 --> 03:21:17,870
Fish to me.

3009
03:21:17,870 --> 03:21:19,870
I love video game fish.

3010
03:21:19,870 --> 03:21:22,750
Hey.

3011
03:21:22,750 --> 03:21:31,579
You didn't tell me to take it off.

3012
03:21:31,579 --> 03:21:33,579
Video game fish looks so appetizing.

3013
03:21:33,579 --> 03:21:35,579
I like fish too in real life.

3014
03:21:35,579 --> 03:21:37,579
It's something about in a video game.

3015
03:21:37,579 --> 03:21:39,579
Just a fish on like a stick.

3016
03:21:39,579 --> 03:21:41,579
You know what I'm saying?

3017
03:21:41,579 --> 03:21:51,440
SpongeBob?

3018
03:21:51,440 --> 03:21:58,799
How many of these do I have?

3019
03:22:03,649 --> 03:22:27,200
Ah, that was raw.

3020
03:22:27,200 --> 03:22:29,200
It's the newest fish from SpongeBob.

3021
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:33,680
All right.

3022
03:22:33,680 --> 03:22:35,680
Move the Weemo.

3023
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:38,500
We're going to cut it up.

3024
03:22:38,500 --> 03:22:47,389
It's cooked, right?

3025
03:22:47,389 --> 03:22:52,959
It would.

3026
03:22:52,959 --> 03:22:54,959
I feel like it was tough to cut through that.

3027
03:22:54,959 --> 03:22:56,959
Shouldn't it have been moist and tender?

3028
03:22:56,959 --> 03:23:04,180
There's some grating.

3029
03:23:04,180 --> 03:23:06,180
Orito's the hardest food in the world.

3030
03:23:06,180 --> 03:23:11,299
The hardest to make

3031
03:23:11,299 --> 03:23:13,299
or it's physically hard

3032
03:23:13,299 --> 03:23:15,299
to chew through.

3033
03:23:15,299 --> 03:23:22,719
It's hard.

3034
03:23:22,719 --> 03:23:34,610
Physically hard.

3035
03:23:34,610 --> 03:23:36,610
You could kill someone with it.

3036
03:23:36,610 --> 03:23:38,610
Really? So that's accurate.

3037
03:23:38,610 --> 03:23:40,610
So it's like a big block.

3038
03:23:40,610 --> 03:23:43,489
How are you supposed to eat it?

3039
03:23:43,489 --> 03:24:04,020
How do you eat this?

3040
03:24:04,020 --> 03:24:07,469
Fine dining.

3041
03:24:07,469 --> 03:24:10,540
Plate was $180.

3042
03:24:10,540 --> 03:24:12,909
You shave it into strips, you idiot.

3043
03:24:12,909 --> 03:24:14,909
Why didn't Mama not do that?

3044
03:24:14,909 --> 03:24:19,780
That was an inch and a half thick cut.

3045
03:24:19,780 --> 03:24:21,780
I'm the idiot.

3046
03:24:21,780 --> 03:24:23,780
I'm sure it's not Mama's instructions

3047
03:24:23,780 --> 03:24:34,459
and Mama's bad recipe.

3048
03:24:34,459 --> 03:24:36,459
You consume it as an enema.

3049
03:24:36,459 --> 03:24:46,450
I should go to a restaurant.

3050
03:24:46,450 --> 03:24:48,750
Yeah, I'll take the bonito.

3051
03:24:48,750 --> 03:24:50,750
How's your bonito?

3052
03:24:50,750 --> 03:24:52,750
Is it any good?

3053
03:24:52,750 --> 03:24:54,750
Well, it's one of our more famous dishes.

3054
03:24:54,750 --> 03:24:56,750
You're like, I'm not sure.

3055
03:24:56,750 --> 03:24:58,750
Let me just get an opinion here.

3056
03:24:58,750 --> 03:25:00,750
You look over, there's a guy like two tables over

3057
03:25:00,750 --> 03:25:02,750
who's like,

3058
03:25:02,750 --> 03:25:05,569
Hey, how's the bonito?

3059
03:25:05,569 --> 03:25:08,450
Fantastic.

3060
03:25:08,450 --> 03:25:10,819
Okay.

3061
03:25:10,819 --> 03:25:12,819
Too salty?

3062
03:25:12,819 --> 03:25:14,819
It's just perfectly, perfectly seasoned.

3063
03:25:14,819 --> 03:25:17,440
I'll try the bonito.

3064
03:25:17,440 --> 03:25:24,860
Oh, bruschette.

3065
03:25:24,860 --> 03:25:29,729
What is bruschette?

3066
03:25:29,729 --> 03:25:35,549
Oh, dude, bruschette's the hottest

3067
03:25:35,549 --> 03:25:37,549
fucking food in the world. You could kill somebody

3068
03:25:37,549 --> 03:25:39,549
with this loaf of red meat.

3069
03:25:39,549 --> 03:26:01,100
Thinly sliced.

3070
03:26:01,100 --> 03:26:03,100
This conversation wouldn't have happened in Chibi

3071
03:26:03,100 --> 03:26:05,100
Robo. Yes, it would have.

3072
03:26:05,100 --> 03:26:08,940
Why are you giving...

3073
03:26:08,940 --> 03:26:10,940
You're giving a lot of credit

3074
03:26:10,940 --> 03:26:12,940
to the fact that we would have this same conversation

3075
03:26:12,940 --> 03:26:14,940
in Chibi... There's a cooking mission

3076
03:26:14,940 --> 03:26:16,940
in Chibi Robo. Isn't there?

3077
03:26:16,940 --> 03:26:24,620
Cooking Chibi Robo? Don't you

3078
03:26:24,620 --> 03:26:26,620
make food for the family and stuff? I can't wait

3079
03:26:26,620 --> 03:26:39,680
to play it. God damn it, Jeremy.

3080
03:26:39,680 --> 03:26:41,680
Get it right.

3081
03:26:41,680 --> 03:26:46,159
It's I hope we never part.

3082
03:26:46,159 --> 03:26:48,159
Get it right or pay the price.

3083
03:26:48,159 --> 03:26:59,040
Up in two pieces.

3084
03:26:59,040 --> 03:27:04,420
Ooh, I love asparagus.

3085
03:27:04,420 --> 03:27:06,909
This is... That's a huge

3086
03:27:06,909 --> 03:27:20,030
asparagus. Shiitake.

3087
03:27:20,030 --> 03:27:34,030
Onya. Worst joke

3088
03:27:34,030 --> 03:27:36,030
in the night. By far.

3089
03:27:36,030 --> 03:27:38,030
Like, by far.

3090
03:27:38,030 --> 03:27:40,030
That was so bad. I'll

3091
03:27:40,030 --> 03:27:42,850
take that one.

3092
03:27:42,850 --> 03:27:47,520
That was really bad.

3093
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:49,520
Wait, you roll the onion into the meat?

3094
03:27:49,520 --> 03:27:51,520
You roll the mushrooms into the meat?

3095
03:27:51,520 --> 03:27:54,079
Hold on a second.

3096
03:27:54,079 --> 03:27:56,079
It's a thinly sliced piece of

3097
03:27:56,079 --> 03:27:58,079
meat, like beef or steak.

3098
03:27:58,079 --> 03:28:00,079
And you put a big chunk of onion in

3099
03:28:00,079 --> 03:28:02,079
and you roll it up.

3100
03:28:02,079 --> 03:28:07,899
Why have I not eaten this yet?

3101
03:28:07,899 --> 03:28:09,899
I think I would really like this.

3102
03:28:09,899 --> 03:28:13,620
And you place it on a stick

3103
03:28:13,620 --> 03:28:17,579
in the same order.

3104
03:28:17,579 --> 03:28:19,579
So it's almost like a kebab?

3105
03:28:19,579 --> 03:28:23,659
Okay, so...

3106
03:28:23,659 --> 03:28:27,569
What the hell are you talking about?

3107
03:28:27,569 --> 03:28:30,059
Wait, I'm supposed to guess?

3108
03:28:30,059 --> 03:28:43,620
No, take that off.

3109
03:28:43,620 --> 03:28:53,860
Why are you making me guess, Mom?

3110
03:28:53,860 --> 03:28:55,860
I really thought I was going to get a first try here.

3111
03:28:55,860 --> 03:29:00,459
Wait, it's the same every time, isn't it?

3112
03:29:00,459 --> 03:29:02,459
Oh, okay. Right. I thought they switched

3113
03:29:02,459 --> 03:29:10,270
it up on you.

3114
03:29:10,270 --> 03:29:19,940
One more. Thoughts on the democratic debate.

3115
03:29:19,940 --> 03:29:21,940
Ah! Eh! Eh! Eh!

3116
03:29:21,940 --> 03:29:52,510
Turn it! God, it's like

3117
03:29:52,510 --> 03:29:54,510
sucks being the grill guy, you know what I mean?

3118
03:29:54,510 --> 03:29:56,510
Like, I don't want to fuck up everybody's food at the party.

3119
03:29:56,510 --> 03:29:58,510
But I'm not qualified to be over here.

3120
03:29:58,510 --> 03:30:01,260
I'm the only one that said I just raised my hand

3121
03:30:01,260 --> 03:30:03,260
when somebody said, hey, who can get on the fucking grill?

3122
03:30:03,260 --> 03:30:05,700
Oh, there's like

3123
03:30:05,700 --> 03:30:07,700
a hundred people here that I could fucking poison.

3124
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:10,190
It's great. Put me on.

3125
03:30:10,190 --> 03:30:22,670
Don't eat that one. No, no, no, no.

3126
03:30:22,670 --> 03:30:24,670
Don't eat that one. Throw it in the trash.

3127
03:30:24,670 --> 03:30:33,379
Throw it in the trash.

3128
03:30:33,379 --> 03:30:35,379
This hurts the old arm here.

3129
03:30:35,379 --> 03:30:41,260
By the way, why are we in like

3130
03:30:41,260 --> 03:30:43,260
14th century England?

3131
03:30:43,260 --> 03:30:45,260
Where's like the

3132
03:30:45,260 --> 03:30:47,260
propane or the fucking charcoal?

3133
03:30:47,260 --> 03:31:12,799
I didn't even cook this one.

3134
03:31:12,799 --> 03:31:29,309
It just started rotting.

3135
03:31:29,309 --> 03:31:31,309
Did you use your other hand? No, I'm a brighty.

3136
03:31:31,309 --> 03:31:38,290
Propane and propane accessories.

3137
03:31:38,290 --> 03:31:41,360
Actually, I wonder

3138
03:31:41,360 --> 03:31:43,360
how dividing this

3139
03:31:43,360 --> 03:31:45,659
will be.

3140
03:31:45,659 --> 03:31:47,659
I like a grilled food,

3141
03:31:47,659 --> 03:31:49,659
right? I'm a big fan

3142
03:31:49,659 --> 03:31:51,659
more than propane. I like charcoal

3143
03:31:51,659 --> 03:31:53,659
more than propane.

3144
03:31:53,659 --> 03:31:57,379
I think charcoal tastes better.

3145
03:31:57,379 --> 03:31:59,379
Alright, is that

3146
03:31:59,379 --> 03:32:01,379
weird?

3147
03:32:01,379 --> 03:32:05,200
Alright, that's it.

3148
03:32:05,200 --> 03:32:07,200
Let's eat pan-fried lobster.

3149
03:32:07,200 --> 03:32:09,200
Everybody agrees with that. Alright.

3150
03:32:09,200 --> 03:32:11,200
Some people are like, no, man.

3151
03:32:14,829 --> 03:32:28,510
Jesus.

3152
03:32:28,510 --> 03:32:32,030
Why did I cut his arms off first?

3153
03:32:32,030 --> 03:32:40,219
There's a lot of things here.

3154
03:32:40,219 --> 03:32:50,209
White powder, white powder.

3155
03:32:50,209 --> 03:32:55,819
Uh,

3156
03:32:55,819 --> 03:32:57,819
Pokémon 1, Pokémon

3157
03:32:57,819 --> 03:32:59,819
2, and then

3158
03:32:59,819 --> 03:33:09,870
Pokémon 3.

3159
03:33:09,870 --> 03:33:13,899
Now, that's the worst joke.

3160
03:33:13,899 --> 03:33:21,969
You're getting it. You understand.

3161
03:33:21,969 --> 03:33:23,969
That's the cover up of the last one.

3162
03:33:23,969 --> 03:33:25,969
You'll remember that one. You won't remember the other one.

3163
03:33:27,969 --> 03:33:29,969
Just fucking complete and total

3164
03:33:29,969 --> 03:33:31,969
tactics.

3165
03:33:33,969 --> 03:33:37,940
Everyone's going to be like,

3166
03:33:37,940 --> 03:33:39,940
dude, remember the Pokémon

3167
03:33:39,940 --> 03:33:41,940
green joke thing?

3168
03:33:41,940 --> 03:33:43,940
It was so bad.

3169
03:33:43,940 --> 03:33:45,940
Alright, dude, that was not funny.

3170
03:33:45,940 --> 03:33:47,940
Yeah, and then you're not going to talk about the other one.

3171
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:54,020
But I win.

3172
03:33:54,020 --> 03:33:57,149
I win.

3173
03:34:03,379 --> 03:34:10,670
The house always wins.

3174
03:34:10,670 --> 03:34:17,459
I really eat

3175
03:34:17,459 --> 03:34:19,459
grilled lobster or like

3176
03:34:19,459 --> 03:34:21,459
pan-fried lobster.

3177
03:34:21,459 --> 03:34:23,459
I'm actually not a huge fan of

3178
03:34:23,459 --> 03:34:25,459
lobster, but usually

3179
03:34:25,459 --> 03:34:27,459
I don't eat it like that.

3180
03:34:27,459 --> 03:34:29,459
I know

3181
03:34:29,459 --> 03:34:31,459
it's a really popular way to eat it, but

3182
03:34:31,459 --> 03:34:33,459
I don't eat like grilled or pan-fried lobster.

3183
03:34:35,459 --> 03:34:38,899
Alright, let's serve it.

3184
03:34:38,899 --> 03:35:24,139
Why is dessert

3185
03:35:24,139 --> 03:35:26,139
on the same plate? I don't get it.

3186
03:35:26,139 --> 03:35:40,610
He doesn't know?

3187
03:35:43,100 --> 03:35:45,100
I mean, why would you... Dessert on the same plate

3188
03:35:45,100 --> 03:35:47,100
just seems... You get like lobster juice

3189
03:35:47,100 --> 03:35:49,100
in your flan. Aren't you going to be a little upset?

3190
03:35:49,100 --> 03:35:58,129
You don't like lobster?

3191
03:35:58,129 --> 03:36:00,129
Where are you actually from?

3192
03:36:00,129 --> 03:36:02,129
I don't hate it.

3193
03:36:02,129 --> 03:36:04,129
I would prefer crab.

3194
03:36:04,129 --> 03:36:06,129
I like crab more than lobster.

3195
03:36:06,129 --> 03:36:08,129
Lobster.

3196
03:36:08,129 --> 03:36:10,129
Wherever it is.

3197
03:36:10,129 --> 03:36:12,879
Alright, we're moving on.

3198
03:36:12,879 --> 03:36:15,180
How much do we have left?

3199
03:36:15,180 --> 03:36:17,180
Pettuccini.

3200
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:20,190
Tortilla.

3201
03:36:22,190 --> 03:36:24,190
We've done a shitload of these.

3202
03:36:26,190 --> 03:36:28,190
Whitefish manure.

3203
03:36:28,190 --> 03:36:31,200
Meatloaf with sausage?

3204
03:36:31,200 --> 03:36:33,200
I thought this was like a raspberry pound cake.

3205
03:36:33,200 --> 03:36:35,760
Let's do the whitefish manure.

3206
03:36:35,760 --> 03:36:45,729
Menure.

3207
03:36:45,729 --> 03:36:47,729
Menure? Menoir? How do you say it?

3208
03:36:47,729 --> 03:36:49,729
How do you phonetically pronounce it?

3209
03:36:49,729 --> 03:36:51,729
Manoir?

3210
03:36:51,729 --> 03:36:53,729
Manoir?

3211
03:36:53,729 --> 03:36:55,729
Mou-nier?

3212
03:36:55,729 --> 03:36:58,420
Mou-nier?

3213
03:36:58,420 --> 03:37:00,420
Mou-nier. Mou-nier.

3214
03:37:02,420 --> 03:37:06,379
Whitefish manure.

3215
03:37:06,379 --> 03:37:10,219
It's garlic in everything.

3216
03:37:10,219 --> 03:37:12,219
Imagine if you were like allergic to fucking garlic.

3217
03:37:12,219 --> 03:37:14,219
You would never be able to eat food.

3218
03:37:14,219 --> 03:37:16,219
It's put in everything.

3219
03:37:20,059 --> 03:37:26,079
Oh, salt.

3220
03:37:28,450 --> 03:37:30,450
Nearly finished.

3221
03:37:30,450 --> 03:37:32,450
Flatfish.

3222
03:37:32,450 --> 03:37:34,450
Go for it.

3223
03:37:34,450 --> 03:37:36,450
Ooh.

3224
03:37:36,450 --> 03:37:38,450
Filling up the skin.

3225
03:37:41,010 --> 03:37:43,700
That easy, apparently.

3226
03:37:47,729 --> 03:37:49,729
Better than mama.

3227
03:37:49,729 --> 03:37:51,969
Whitefish manure.

3228
03:37:51,969 --> 03:37:53,969
Add to the milk?

3229
03:37:53,969 --> 03:37:59,540
Soak

3230
03:37:59,540 --> 03:38:14,260
fish in milk.

3231
03:38:14,260 --> 03:38:16,879
I won't be eating this anytime soon.

3232
03:38:16,879 --> 03:38:19,120
I will not be ordering

3233
03:38:19,120 --> 03:38:21,120
whitefish manure.

3234
03:38:21,120 --> 03:38:31,420
I don't think I will.

3235
03:38:31,420 --> 03:38:33,420
What does this taste like?

3236
03:38:33,420 --> 03:38:39,760
Shake the milk and then

3237
03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:41,760
flour the flour? Is it fried?

3238
03:38:50,459 --> 03:38:56,100
Somebody just fucked with me.

3239
03:38:56,100 --> 03:38:59,229
Somebody fucked with me.

3240
03:38:59,229 --> 03:39:01,229
That's like I took the salt

3241
03:39:01,229 --> 03:39:03,229
shaker. I'm going to put some salt on

3242
03:39:03,229 --> 03:39:05,229
and the whole thing comes out like the

3243
03:39:05,229 --> 03:39:07,229
shitty prank.

3244
03:39:07,229 --> 03:39:14,340
Somebody pranked me.

3245
03:39:14,340 --> 03:39:18,430
So bad.

3246
03:39:33,729 --> 03:39:35,729
Alright, now we pan fry

3247
03:39:35,729 --> 03:39:37,729
our milk fish.

3248
03:39:37,729 --> 03:39:41,180
Milk and flour.

3249
03:39:41,180 --> 03:39:46,049
I mean, I guess that's not super

3250
03:39:46,049 --> 03:39:48,049
weird. I guess it's not weird or anything.

3251
03:39:48,049 --> 03:39:50,049
It's just kind of different.

3252
03:39:50,049 --> 03:39:52,049
Although you

3253
03:39:52,049 --> 03:39:54,049
soak it in the milk. You don't just like

3254
03:39:54,049 --> 03:39:56,049
lay it in there for a second. You soak it.

3255
03:39:58,049 --> 03:40:00,049
It's two different fishes.

3256
03:40:00,049 --> 03:40:10,340
What about the bones?

3257
03:40:10,340 --> 03:40:14,799
There's a void there.

3258
03:40:16,799 --> 03:40:20,129
There it is.

3259
03:40:20,129 --> 03:40:22,129
It's how you make fried chicken.

3260
03:40:22,129 --> 03:40:24,129
I think chicken is a little different than fish. I don't know if I'd want

3261
03:40:24,129 --> 03:40:26,129
milk on fish.

3262
03:40:26,129 --> 03:40:30,909
I don't know about this.

3263
03:40:30,909 --> 03:40:33,280
Something about this is weird.

3264
03:40:33,280 --> 03:40:35,649
No new American dishes

3265
03:40:35,649 --> 03:40:39,489
by the way.

3266
03:40:39,489 --> 03:40:41,489
Oh!

3267
03:40:41,489 --> 03:40:43,790
Bulabase.

3268
03:40:43,790 --> 03:40:47,440
Bulabase.

3269
03:40:47,440 --> 03:40:51,219
French bulabase.

3270
03:40:51,219 --> 03:40:53,709
Bulabase.

3271
03:40:53,709 --> 03:41:03,250
Bulabase.

3272
03:41:03,250 --> 03:41:12,959
Scallops.

3273
03:41:12,959 --> 03:41:15,780
Scallop, huh?

3274
03:41:15,780 --> 03:41:17,780
It's like the only little thing you know.

3275
03:41:19,780 --> 03:41:22,530
You're using a chisel to get a scallop?

3276
03:41:24,700 --> 03:41:35,440
What fish is that?

3277
03:41:35,440 --> 03:41:37,440
It's like Stardew Valley fish. What was that?

3278
03:41:37,440 --> 03:41:41,090
What animal is this?

3279
03:41:41,090 --> 03:41:43,090
It's weird meat.

3280
03:41:45,090 --> 03:41:47,090
Round like red animal.

3281
03:41:50,540 --> 03:42:15,680
Why are you farming?

3282
03:42:15,680 --> 03:42:17,680
I don't know because it's fun.

3283
03:42:20,940 --> 03:42:23,950
Why am I cooking a tail?

3284
03:42:23,950 --> 03:42:29,649
You don't eat the tail?

3285
03:42:29,649 --> 03:42:31,649
Why do you need three salt shakers? I don't know.

3286
03:42:31,649 --> 03:42:33,649
Ask mama. It's her house.

3287
03:42:36,139 --> 03:42:46,829
I use the spices to

3288
03:42:46,829 --> 03:42:48,829
flavor the spices.

3289
03:42:48,829 --> 03:42:50,829
How do I pronounce this?

3290
03:42:50,829 --> 03:42:53,459
How do you actually pronounce it?

3291
03:42:53,459 --> 03:43:04,579
Bulabase.

3292
03:43:04,579 --> 03:43:07,520
Bulabase.

3293
03:43:07,520 --> 03:43:09,700
Bulabase.

3294
03:43:09,700 --> 03:43:12,770
Come on!

3295
03:43:12,770 --> 03:43:16,989
Bulabase.

3296
03:43:16,989 --> 03:43:23,899
Bulabase.

3297
03:43:23,899 --> 03:43:27,620
Bulabase.

3298
03:43:27,620 --> 03:43:29,620
Bulabase.

3299
03:43:29,620 --> 03:43:32,559
Bulabase.

3300
03:43:32,559 --> 03:43:45,219
The bulabase is

3301
03:43:45,219 --> 03:43:49,889
silent.

3302
03:43:49,889 --> 03:43:53,149
I think I've had this before.

3303
03:43:53,149 --> 03:43:55,149
Yeah, I've eaten this before.

3304
03:43:55,149 --> 03:43:57,389
This is delicious.

3305
03:43:57,389 --> 03:43:59,389
There's like a bunch of seafood, like that tomato base.

3306
03:43:59,389 --> 03:44:01,389
It's fantastic. I've had this before.

3307
03:44:01,389 --> 03:44:07,149
It's alive? No, it's not.

3308
03:44:07,149 --> 03:44:10,030
Kim ordered it and I tried it.

3309
03:44:10,030 --> 03:44:12,030
I had like three or four sips of the broth and I tried like one of those scallops and shit.

3310
03:44:20,860 --> 03:44:23,489
Kim, you're so worldly

3311
03:44:23,489 --> 03:44:25,489
and cultured.

3312
03:44:32,020 --> 03:44:40,510
I thought that was American.

3313
03:44:40,510 --> 03:44:42,510
I thought it was going to be like a Cobb salad.

3314
03:44:42,510 --> 03:44:50,700
Crudite?

3315
03:44:50,700 --> 03:44:52,700
It is a Cobb salad.

3316
03:44:52,700 --> 03:44:54,700
What is this?

3317
03:44:54,700 --> 03:44:58,159
Remove the yolk. Alright.

3318
03:44:58,159 --> 03:45:38,909
I caught it! You're kind of losing me here.

3319
03:45:38,909 --> 03:45:42,370
Eggs and vinegar?

3320
03:45:42,370 --> 03:45:49,469
That's a lot of vinegar.

3321
03:45:49,469 --> 03:45:51,469
You know like the way that raw eggs smell?

3322
03:45:51,469 --> 03:45:53,780
Now imagine

3323
03:45:53,780 --> 03:45:55,780
raw eggs and vinegar

3324
03:45:55,780 --> 03:46:01,149
in the same...

3325
03:46:01,149 --> 03:46:03,149
That's mayo? That's not mayo.

3326
03:46:03,149 --> 03:46:14,799
Mayo's oil. I mean, no.

3327
03:46:28,299 --> 03:46:36,559
Old men like peppers.

3328
03:46:36,559 --> 03:46:44,239
It's a stable

3329
03:46:44,239 --> 03:46:46,239
emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and an acidity of vinegar

3330
03:46:46,239 --> 03:46:48,239
or lemon juice.

3331
03:46:48,239 --> 03:46:50,479
Give it like a tiny bit.

3332
03:46:50,479 --> 03:46:52,479
Like only a little bit of lemon juice.

3333
03:46:52,479 --> 03:46:54,479
You don't like dump half the bottle in like she was.

3334
03:46:54,479 --> 03:46:58,770
Cutting is satisfying.

3335
03:46:58,770 --> 03:47:02,540
It really is.

3336
03:47:02,540 --> 03:47:04,540
Red pepper, yellow pepper,

3337
03:47:04,540 --> 03:47:08,450
and onion.

3338
03:47:08,450 --> 03:47:10,450
Maybe it's a lot of mayo.

3339
03:47:12,450 --> 03:47:14,450
Making an egg salad.

3340
03:47:14,450 --> 03:47:16,620
I love egg salad.

3341
03:47:23,540 --> 03:47:30,829
Oh, this is the last pieces for some reason.

3342
03:47:30,829 --> 03:47:42,670
I do.

3343
03:47:42,670 --> 03:47:44,670
I acknowledge it looks gross.

3344
03:47:44,670 --> 03:47:46,670
If you make egg salad

3345
03:47:46,670 --> 03:47:48,670
chunky enough, it looks a lot more

3346
03:47:48,670 --> 03:47:50,670
appetizing than if you make it paste.

3347
03:47:50,670 --> 03:48:02,829
Put a little bit of dill in there too.

3348
03:48:02,829 --> 03:48:04,829
You make it look not just like a paste.

3349
03:48:04,829 --> 03:48:10,829
You can go south real easily.

3350
03:48:10,829 --> 03:48:12,829
Well, you gotta eat it within a couple of days.

3351
03:48:12,829 --> 03:48:15,840
You can really get into trouble

3352
03:48:15,840 --> 03:48:17,840
with egg salad if you make it and you make a bunch of it

3353
03:48:17,840 --> 03:48:19,840
and then a week and a half goes by.

3354
03:48:19,840 --> 03:48:22,020
And you go,

3355
03:48:22,020 --> 03:48:24,020
oh man, I really want some of that egg salad.

3356
03:48:24,020 --> 03:48:26,510
And you open the fridge

3357
03:48:26,510 --> 03:48:28,510
and now your whole house smells like rotten egg.

3358
03:48:30,510 --> 03:48:40,799
Okay, here we go.

3359
03:48:40,799 --> 03:48:45,790
I don't know what this is.

3360
03:48:45,790 --> 03:48:48,540
It's like a salad

3361
03:48:48,540 --> 03:49:10,110
of some sort.

3362
03:49:10,110 --> 03:49:32,299
I've never had this.

3363
03:49:32,299 --> 03:49:38,379
Like, I wanna, fuck it, I don't even care.

3364
03:49:38,379 --> 03:49:57,200
You're really gonna have to

3365
03:49:57,200 --> 03:50:07,379
fucking find it, you know what I mean?

3366
03:50:07,379 --> 03:50:11,729
You really gotta search for it in there.

3367
03:50:11,729 --> 03:50:13,729
It's a nest

3368
03:50:13,729 --> 03:50:15,729
for an egg.

3369
03:50:15,729 --> 03:50:17,729
It's an egg nest.

3370
03:50:17,729 --> 03:50:25,659
That's a stand up and leave

3371
03:50:25,659 --> 03:50:27,659
the restaurant kind of presentation.

3372
03:50:27,659 --> 03:50:30,420
That's a like,

3373
03:50:30,420 --> 03:50:33,680
excuse me,

3374
03:50:33,680 --> 03:50:36,430
what is this?

3375
03:50:36,430 --> 03:50:38,430
Is this gonna get fixed or

3376
03:50:38,430 --> 03:50:40,430
I don't want to check or anything

3377
03:50:40,430 --> 03:50:45,870
after this.

3378
03:50:45,870 --> 03:50:47,870
Let's make the raspberry pound cake.

3379
03:50:47,870 --> 03:50:57,520
Crack the egg.

3380
03:50:57,520 --> 03:51:00,530
Where's the American food?

3381
03:51:00,530 --> 03:51:02,530
Oh, I'm with you. I really am.

3382
03:51:02,530 --> 03:51:04,530
I've been playing it for this long because I want to see

3383
03:51:04,530 --> 03:51:14,639
what the American food is.

3384
03:51:14,639 --> 03:51:25,379
Bonus.

3385
03:51:25,379 --> 03:51:28,700
Fried butter.

3386
03:51:28,700 --> 03:51:30,700
Meatloaf with sausage.

3387
03:51:30,700 --> 03:51:33,260
Alright, let's go. Onion.

3388
03:51:33,260 --> 03:51:37,620
Chop it up.

3389
03:51:39,620 --> 03:51:42,239
What are we gonna make? Burgers?

3390
03:51:42,239 --> 03:51:44,239
We made burger before, but it was a long time ago.

3391
03:51:44,239 --> 03:51:49,100
I don't know that American cuisine

3392
03:51:49,100 --> 03:51:51,100
is not just hamburgers.

3393
03:51:51,100 --> 03:51:53,659
It's the rest of the menu

3394
03:51:53,659 --> 03:51:55,659
at that restaurant, which is 12 different burgers.

3395
03:51:55,659 --> 03:51:57,659
We've got a cheese burger.

3396
03:51:57,659 --> 03:51:59,659
A barbecue sauce

3397
03:51:59,659 --> 03:52:01,659
and onion rings burger.

3398
03:52:01,659 --> 03:52:03,659
A macaroni

3399
03:52:03,659 --> 03:52:05,659
and cheese burger.

3400
03:52:05,659 --> 03:52:07,659
It's not just hamburger.

3401
03:52:07,659 --> 03:52:12,510
And they all have really cool names.

3402
03:52:12,510 --> 03:52:14,510
Like we name it like, you know,

3403
03:52:14,510 --> 03:52:16,510
like the super juicer.

3404
03:52:16,510 --> 03:52:18,510
And it's like a fucking lettuce with like two

3405
03:52:18,510 --> 03:52:20,510
eggs on it.

3406
03:52:20,510 --> 03:52:22,510
Oh, the lazy sundae.

3407
03:52:22,510 --> 03:52:24,510
It's like two patties with

3408
03:52:24,510 --> 03:52:26,510
two pieces of bacon and like

3409
03:52:26,510 --> 03:52:28,510
a couple of hash browns on it.

3410
03:52:28,510 --> 03:52:30,510
Wait, that's American.

3411
03:52:30,510 --> 03:52:32,510
Where are all those?

3412
03:52:32,510 --> 03:52:48,110
I want that garlic in here.

3413
03:52:48,110 --> 03:52:50,110
Come on, onions.

3414
03:52:50,110 --> 03:52:53,700
Alright, whatever.

3415
03:52:53,700 --> 03:52:56,379
Make the webcam wider.

3416
03:52:56,379 --> 03:52:58,379
You wish you could see what was going on over here, don't you?

3417
03:52:58,379 --> 03:53:15,200
How's that?

3418
03:53:15,200 --> 03:53:17,200
Alright, meatloaf with sausage.

3419
03:53:27,680 --> 03:53:29,680
There's a whole wall of streaming trophies.

3420
03:53:29,680 --> 03:53:33,760
I would kill

3421
03:53:33,760 --> 03:53:35,760
the smell of some onions in a pan right now.

3422
03:53:37,760 --> 03:53:42,940
I mean, you probably have

3423
03:53:42,940 --> 03:53:44,940
onions in your house.

3424
03:53:44,940 --> 03:53:47,250
You could make that happen right now

3425
03:53:47,250 --> 03:53:49,250
if you really wanted to.

3426
03:53:49,250 --> 03:53:51,250
Onions are in every house.

3427
03:53:51,250 --> 03:53:55,409
You can just go do that.

3428
03:53:55,409 --> 03:53:57,409
Just go do it.

3429
03:53:57,409 --> 03:53:59,409
Chop up some onions.

3430
03:53:59,409 --> 03:54:01,409
Sizzle them up in a pan with a little oil.

3431
03:54:03,409 --> 03:54:06,030
Put it on like a bologna cheese sandwich.

3432
03:54:06,030 --> 03:54:08,030
Who cares?

3433
03:54:08,030 --> 03:54:10,030
Just eat it.

3434
03:54:10,030 --> 03:54:27,309
Where's the American food?

3435
03:54:32,180 --> 03:54:36,850
How would you ruin a perfectly good sandwich like that?

3436
03:54:38,850 --> 03:54:40,850
What's wrong with that?

3437
03:54:40,850 --> 03:54:42,850
Onions are good.

3438
03:54:42,850 --> 03:54:45,979
What the hell was that?

3439
03:54:45,979 --> 03:54:50,780
What am I doing?

3440
03:54:50,780 --> 03:54:57,229
Hot dogs?

3441
03:54:57,229 --> 03:55:04,340
What are those?

3442
03:55:06,510 --> 03:55:09,969
This would be a really heavy lunch.

3443
03:55:09,969 --> 03:55:11,969
Oh, sausages.

3444
03:55:11,969 --> 03:55:13,969
They don't look like sausages.

3445
03:55:13,969 --> 03:55:15,969
They look weird.

3446
03:55:17,969 --> 03:55:19,969
You're hiding turds.

3447
03:55:39,409 --> 03:55:42,350
What do you say it looks like?

3448
03:55:42,350 --> 03:55:48,819
Kitty litter.

3449
03:55:50,819 --> 03:55:58,430
Cut it?

3450
03:55:58,430 --> 03:56:00,430
I don't know if I like this.

3451
03:56:00,430 --> 03:56:07,219
This is weird cartoon food.

3452
03:56:07,219 --> 03:56:09,219
Serve as much as you like. Isn't it just the brick?

3453
03:56:09,219 --> 03:56:25,600
I would eat two of these.

3454
03:56:25,600 --> 03:56:29,120
Two would make sense.

3455
03:56:33,389 --> 03:57:15,180
I'm trying to make it actually presenting.

3456
03:57:24,379 --> 03:57:26,379
Yeah, it does look like Fancy Feast.

3457
03:57:26,379 --> 03:57:29,260
Somebody said cat food.

3458
03:57:29,260 --> 03:57:31,260
It looks like

3459
03:57:31,260 --> 03:57:33,260
when you turn the can, it just

3460
03:57:33,260 --> 03:57:36,590
Fancy Feast?

3461
03:57:36,590 --> 03:57:38,590
And they have that big, huge, white, fuzzy-ass cat?

3462
03:57:48,770 --> 03:57:50,770
What they don't show in that commercial

3463
03:57:50,770 --> 03:57:53,200
is Fancy Feast.

3464
03:57:53,200 --> 03:57:55,200
Oh, cat's going to love you.

3465
03:57:55,200 --> 03:57:57,200
And the goblet and the cat's like...

3466
03:57:57,200 --> 03:57:59,200
What they don't show is the mom

3467
03:57:59,200 --> 03:58:01,200
going...

3468
03:58:01,200 --> 03:58:03,200
Oh, more hair in my mouth.

3469
03:58:03,200 --> 03:58:05,200
There's hair all over my mouth.

3470
03:58:05,200 --> 03:58:07,200
They don't show that part.

3471
03:58:07,200 --> 03:58:13,469
That's real life for the cat like that.

3472
03:58:13,469 --> 03:58:20,450
Yeah, they don't show the mom

3473
03:58:20,450 --> 03:58:22,450
walking over with a tray of Fancy Feast.

3474
03:58:26,750 --> 03:58:28,750
Okay, here you go, honey.

3475
03:58:28,750 --> 03:58:44,049
He's not licking the cat.

3476
03:58:44,049 --> 03:58:47,309
It's just in the air.

3477
03:58:47,309 --> 03:59:00,239
Just because an animal licks you

3478
03:59:00,239 --> 03:59:11,569
doesn't mean you should look at that.

3479
03:59:16,299 --> 03:59:23,920
No, that's not a joke. He's correct.

3480
03:59:23,920 --> 03:59:25,920
I know.

3481
03:59:25,920 --> 03:59:27,920
But people are saying that I'm licking a cat.

3482
03:59:27,920 --> 03:59:29,920
That's not what it is.

3483
03:59:29,920 --> 03:59:45,579
What am I saying?

3484
03:59:45,579 --> 03:59:47,579
I'm saying that there's hair everywhere.

3485
03:59:47,579 --> 03:59:57,309
But it's just real life.

3486
03:59:57,309 --> 03:59:59,309
That's just what you have to do.

3487
03:59:59,309 --> 04:00:01,940
Yeah.

3488
04:00:01,940 --> 04:00:05,649
Brush your cat, even if you brush.

3489
04:00:05,649 --> 04:00:18,430
I'm normal.

3490
04:00:18,430 --> 04:00:29,180
That's a lot of vegetables.

3491
04:00:29,180 --> 04:00:31,940
Spread them out. We need the olive oil.

3492
04:00:31,940 --> 04:00:35,579
Yeah, get it in there.

3493
04:00:35,579 --> 04:00:37,579
Come on, eggplant. Fuck you.

3494
04:00:37,579 --> 04:00:50,959
Let Bugleberry play.

3495
04:00:50,959 --> 04:00:53,520
No. Absolutely not.

3496
04:00:53,520 --> 04:01:18,909
Wink.

3497
04:01:18,909 --> 04:01:20,909
You're going to lose 500 viewers

3498
04:01:20,909 --> 04:01:22,909
just mentioning Bugleberry.

3499
04:01:22,909 --> 04:01:25,979
It's bound to happen, actually.

3500
04:01:25,979 --> 04:01:29,120
You're right.

3501
04:01:29,120 --> 04:01:31,120
I thought winking was over. No, in three days it's over.

3502
04:01:31,120 --> 04:01:33,739
Alright, American.

3503
04:01:33,739 --> 04:01:36,049
American cuisine.

3504
04:01:36,049 --> 04:01:39,500
Mac and cheese.

3505
04:01:39,500 --> 04:01:46,930
Mac and cheese.

3506
04:01:46,930 --> 04:01:57,940
Do you want to do them all?

3507
04:01:57,940 --> 04:02:01,260
Fettuccine. Ooh, I love fettuccine.

3508
04:02:01,260 --> 04:02:11,569
Fettuccine is amazing.

3509
04:02:11,569 --> 04:02:17,709
The best part about fettuccine is when

3510
04:02:17,709 --> 04:02:19,709
you're done.

3511
04:02:19,709 --> 04:02:21,709
Oh, now I want fettuccine.

3512
04:02:21,709 --> 04:02:23,709
We're going to have to do a poll after this.

3513
04:02:23,709 --> 04:02:26,780
So when you have

3514
04:02:26,780 --> 04:02:28,780
fettuccine alfredo

3515
04:02:28,780 --> 04:02:31,020
and when it's all gone, the

3516
04:02:31,020 --> 04:02:33,020
pasta's gone, and you just have that...

3517
04:02:33,020 --> 04:02:35,020
You know when you eat cereal and there's

3518
04:02:35,020 --> 04:02:37,020
that delicious milk at the bottom of the sugary

3519
04:02:37,020 --> 04:02:39,020
milk? This is the... it's the same

3520
04:02:39,020 --> 04:02:41,020
thing, except you dip

3521
04:02:41,020 --> 04:02:43,020
bread in it. It's like the milk after you eat the cereal.

3522
04:02:43,020 --> 04:02:45,020
It's fucking incredible.

3523
04:02:45,020 --> 04:02:47,020
You just use it to put bread in

3524
04:02:47,020 --> 04:02:49,020
and... Oh wait, but you have some other...

3525
04:02:49,020 --> 04:02:51,020
You're going to eat that? Let me like dip that and use

3526
04:02:51,020 --> 04:02:53,020
that in my fucking cereal milk. You know what I mean?

3527
04:02:53,020 --> 04:02:55,020
It's so amazing. I want it so

3528
04:02:55,020 --> 04:02:57,649
bad now.

3529
04:02:57,649 --> 04:03:02,000
We're going to have to do a poll.

3530
04:03:02,000 --> 04:03:05,069
We're going to have to do a poll tonight.

3531
04:03:05,069 --> 04:03:09,680
Is this a salmonella?

3532
04:03:09,680 --> 04:03:15,250
I defended your

3533
04:03:15,250 --> 04:03:17,250
cat fur a bit. I can't defend

3534
04:03:17,250 --> 04:03:19,250
that one. Well, you can't defend...

3535
04:03:19,250 --> 04:03:21,250
Eating the rest of the alfredo

3536
04:03:21,250 --> 04:03:23,250
at the bottom of the bowl?

3537
04:03:23,250 --> 04:03:25,809
Alright.

3538
04:03:25,809 --> 04:03:40,700
I said, why are you so out there

3539
04:03:40,700 --> 04:03:45,120
tonight? I'm just like having fun.

3540
04:03:45,120 --> 04:03:48,770
I'm just like hungry and having fun.

3541
04:03:52,479 --> 04:03:54,780
Oh, I think you're talking about cereal.

3542
04:03:54,780 --> 04:03:56,780
Look at how much... how many steps there are in this.

3543
04:03:56,780 --> 04:04:00,690
Don't touch my food.

3544
04:04:00,690 --> 04:04:02,690
Don't worry, I won't.

3545
04:04:07,620 --> 04:04:14,139
Oh no.

3546
04:04:14,139 --> 04:04:16,700
When are we going to get a real life cooking stream?

3547
04:04:16,700 --> 04:04:18,700
I don't know.

3548
04:04:18,700 --> 04:04:22,590
I don't know. We never will.

3549
04:04:26,860 --> 04:04:28,860
Alright, here we go.

3550
04:04:28,860 --> 04:04:31,680
Pasta time. The best part.

3551
04:04:31,680 --> 04:04:47,229
Yeah, we're going to do a food poll after this.

3552
04:04:47,229 --> 04:04:52,540
This is the most important

3553
04:04:52,540 --> 04:04:54,540
thing the entire day, by the way.

3554
04:04:54,540 --> 04:04:56,780
Is what

3555
04:04:56,780 --> 04:04:58,780
food am I going to go eat?

3556
04:04:58,780 --> 04:05:00,780
It's the most important thing the whole day.

3557
04:05:00,780 --> 04:05:04,430
What are the choices?

3558
04:05:04,430 --> 04:05:07,379
You'll see. You'll see.

3559
04:05:09,379 --> 04:05:11,379
Calamari will not be on the list.

3560
04:05:22,110 --> 04:05:24,110
Vote for squid. You're not going to vote for something

3561
04:05:24,110 --> 04:05:26,110
that's not on the part of the ballot.

3562
04:05:26,110 --> 04:05:36,860
Has reservations about cooking stream

3563
04:05:36,860 --> 04:05:38,860
but will get slimed in a diaper

3564
04:05:38,860 --> 04:05:44,940
for two and a half hours. So?

3565
04:06:05,540 --> 04:06:12,260
Vote for durian fruit.

3566
04:06:12,260 --> 04:06:21,600
Vote for durian fruit.

3567
04:06:21,600 --> 04:06:23,600
I can't wait for some nice American cuisine.

3568
04:06:23,600 --> 04:06:28,020
Watch the next one just be

3569
04:06:28,020 --> 04:06:30,020
Oh, a new American cuisine unlocked.

3570
04:06:30,020 --> 04:06:32,020
Bag of Cheetos.

3571
04:06:32,020 --> 04:06:34,190
And it's just

3572
04:06:34,190 --> 04:06:36,190
pull with Wiimote to the left

3573
04:06:36,190 --> 04:06:38,190
and you open them.

3574
04:06:38,190 --> 04:06:40,879
And then you just dump them on a plate.

3575
04:06:40,879 --> 04:06:42,879
Alright, that's great. Now this is going to be cheese.

3576
04:06:42,879 --> 04:06:44,879
See? I told you.

3577
04:06:44,879 --> 04:06:48,020
Party clogs? Fuck you.

3578
04:06:48,020 --> 04:06:56,510
He hates foreign food.

3579
04:07:00,510 --> 04:07:02,510
I just told you.

3580
04:07:02,510 --> 04:07:04,819
There's a pizza crust.

3581
04:07:04,819 --> 04:07:08,909
Mmm. Pizza's pretty good too.

3582
04:07:08,909 --> 04:07:10,909
But I gotta start. Yeah, I guess he likes the pizza.

3583
04:07:10,909 --> 04:07:12,909
Trying to cut back

3584
04:07:12,909 --> 04:07:14,909
on just all

3585
04:07:14,909 --> 04:07:16,909
the bread and cheese and stuff.

3586
04:07:16,909 --> 04:07:18,909
Although that's pasta.

3587
04:07:18,909 --> 04:07:23,329
Whatever.

3588
04:07:23,329 --> 04:07:30,750
Pizza's kind of dull.

3589
04:07:30,750 --> 04:07:32,750
It's not that it's dull or anything. It's just

3590
04:07:32,750 --> 04:07:35,309
you know exactly

3591
04:07:35,309 --> 04:07:37,309
what it's going to be when you get it.

3592
04:07:37,309 --> 04:07:39,549
There's no surprise anymore.

3593
04:07:39,549 --> 04:07:41,549
This is pizza and I know exactly what it is

3594
04:07:41,549 --> 04:07:43,549
and it's just I'm doing it because I'm doing it.

3595
04:07:43,549 --> 04:07:47,069
How is this overcooked?

3596
04:07:47,069 --> 04:07:49,500
It needs some adventure.

3597
04:07:49,500 --> 04:07:58,579
Just order a different kind of pizza.

3598
04:07:58,579 --> 04:08:01,260
But why would you

3599
04:08:01,260 --> 04:08:03,260
ever order anything besides a pepperoni

3600
04:08:03,260 --> 04:08:05,260
thin crust pizza? There's no other pizzas. I'm sorry.

3601
04:08:05,260 --> 04:08:19,469
They don't exist.

3602
04:08:19,469 --> 04:08:28,879
That heat up.

3603
04:08:28,879 --> 04:08:30,879
I would send you a can of Sir Stromming, but it might be

3604
04:08:30,879 --> 04:08:34,020
a

3605
04:08:34,020 --> 04:08:45,659
I wouldn't eat Sir Stromming.

3606
04:08:45,659 --> 04:08:56,159
Powered.

3607
04:08:56,159 --> 04:08:59,420
That shit would get in the walls. Thick crust.

3608
04:08:59,420 --> 04:09:01,420
No, not thick crust. I don't like thick crust.

3609
04:09:01,420 --> 04:09:03,420
No! Where's the American

3610
04:09:03,420 --> 04:09:05,420
macaroni and cheese?

3611
04:09:05,420 --> 04:09:10,479
I know you have it in here.

3612
04:09:15,780 --> 04:09:18,270
Truffles!

3613
04:09:18,270 --> 04:09:20,270
Sushi! I love sushi.

3614
04:09:20,270 --> 04:09:22,270
Sushi. Sushi.

3615
04:09:22,270 --> 04:09:24,270
Sushi. Sushi. Sushi. Sushi.

3616
04:09:24,270 --> 04:09:26,270
Sushi.

3617
04:09:26,270 --> 04:09:28,270
What kind of fish is it though? Tuna.

3618
04:09:28,270 --> 04:09:30,270
That's a spicy tuna roll. Yep.

3619
04:09:30,270 --> 04:09:32,270
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

3620
04:09:32,270 --> 04:09:34,510
Spicy tuna roll.

3621
04:09:34,510 --> 04:09:42,770
I hope it's spicy tuna roll.

3622
04:09:42,770 --> 04:09:45,329
JPG.

3623
04:09:45,329 --> 04:09:48,530
Scallops.

3624
04:09:48,530 --> 04:09:50,530
Why are there scallops in my sushi?

3625
04:09:50,530 --> 04:09:55,010
I don't want this.

3626
04:10:01,899 --> 04:10:03,899
I wanted a tuna roll. I wanted a spicy tuna roll.

3627
04:10:03,899 --> 04:10:10,299
I don't want scallops.

3628
04:10:10,299 --> 04:10:13,250
Is this a durian?

3629
04:10:13,250 --> 04:10:20,590
That is a durian.

3630
04:10:20,590 --> 04:10:25,389
Let's get going. Cut!

3631
04:10:25,389 --> 04:10:32,750
This is a sea urchin.

3632
04:10:32,750 --> 04:10:34,750
I don't like that either.

3633
04:10:36,750 --> 04:10:38,750
I like salmon sashimi.

3634
04:10:38,750 --> 04:10:41,059
Maki rolls.

3635
04:10:41,059 --> 04:10:43,059
I don't really like...I like

3636
04:10:43,059 --> 04:10:45,059
Maki rolls. I'm not a big fan of...

3637
04:10:45,059 --> 04:10:47,059
Tuna sashimi.

3638
04:10:47,059 --> 04:10:49,059
Salmon sashimi.

3639
04:10:49,059 --> 04:10:51,059
Just over the rice. I'm okay with that.

3640
04:10:51,059 --> 04:10:53,059
But I don't...I like

3641
04:10:53,059 --> 04:10:55,059
rolls. I like Maki rolls.

3642
04:10:55,059 --> 04:10:57,059
You're a normie.

3643
04:10:59,299 --> 04:11:01,299
Uhhh.

3644
04:11:01,299 --> 04:11:03,299
Um.

3645
04:11:03,299 --> 04:11:05,299
No.

3646
04:11:05,299 --> 04:11:10,100
I'm just a normal person.

3647
04:11:10,100 --> 04:11:12,100
I'm just a normal person.

3648
04:11:12,100 --> 04:11:14,100
Um.

3649
04:11:14,100 --> 04:11:16,100
Um. Am I?

3650
04:11:16,100 --> 04:11:19,100
Because I know a lot of people that

3651
04:11:19,100 --> 04:11:21,100
don't eat sushi.

3652
04:11:21,100 --> 04:11:29,149
That just physically will

3653
04:11:29,149 --> 04:11:31,149
