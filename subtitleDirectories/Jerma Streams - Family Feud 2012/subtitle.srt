1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:16,539
Alright, have you guys decided on, let's see, potential elimination? Or do we just do Xbox?

2
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:23,769
I feel like 150 people would like to choose between these two.

3
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:44,329
So we could eliminate Tier List. Let's do another one. Because I could Tier List either way.

4
00:00:44,329 --> 00:01:19,900
Alright, here we go. Add a neither option? Neither. Well then it's like, alright,

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:37,129
I'll see you later. Again, we're at the stage where it is so, it is too close that

6
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,540
streamer might, streamer, which is me, might just have to pick one of these.

7
00:01:45,980 --> 00:02:27,849
262 to 262? 268 to 264? It's too split. Alright, here we go. I didn't vote? Well vote!

8
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:34,139
This is the only opportunity you're gonna get. Do both? Both of these things will take

9
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:45,430
more time than I would like to stay streaming. If I did both. Alright, we're getting close to

10
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,610
where I'm gonna have to turn this down here. Turn this off. People now, oh, every, all I had

11
00:02:51,610 --> 00:03:11,219
to say was let's go. It's still too close to call. Looks like it's pulling away a little bit. It's

12
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:21,860
pulling away. It's pulling out. I'm gonna have to do it. Oh, it's, oh, we got about, if you haven't

13
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:32,819
voted, this is your last opportunity. I'm gonna count from 10, starting right now. 10, 9, 8,

14
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,469
wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. People need to have the poll again.

15
00:03:41,960 --> 00:04:03,030
Okay, just in case. This is it. Go do it. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Thank you for voting.

16
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,939
Family Feud is won. We're gonna play Family Feud for a couple of hours. On the Xbox. So Family

17
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:19,720
Feud wins anyways. It's close though. Family Feud coming up. Uh, let me just set it up real quick.

18
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,040
I'll be a minute or two because I don't have my Xbox plugged in or anything. So give me, uh,

19
00:04:24,759 --> 00:06:19,560
give me like a minute, give me like two minutes. I'll be right back. All right. Did it work?

20
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:32,810
Let's see. Where's my Xbox controller? That would be useful. That'd be nice if I actually had it.

21
00:06:38,649 --> 00:07:00,579
I didn't shred this game, right? No. Stay mad. TT tears. Hey, a true champion does not brag about

22
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:10,089
his win. A true champion does a shitload of interviews and is respected around the goddamn

23
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:20,250
world, which is essentially kind of the same thing. A true champion does not talk shit.

24
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:47,029
I got a hopeless fucking captured. Hey, it did. Okay. Uh, all right. Hold on. I gotta change this

25
00:07:47,029 --> 00:08:08,899
thing. I gotta change things to take disclaimer, everybody, just in case. Family Feud. I have to do

26
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:24,500
this though, because I'm going to be coming in. Hopefully that's enough of a delay. Yeah, this is

27
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:38,230
2012 Family Feud. We don't have any, but this is not a recent one. Change the title of the stream.

28
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:53,139
Family Feud 2012. Are you on the Twitch list? I wonder. I am going to do myself a favor here

29
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:59,139
and I am going to unplug the fucking connect because I just saw a like that's so Raven vision

30
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:17,580
of me sitting here with no clothes on. So I, I'm going to make sure that don't happen.

31
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:28,840
All right. We'll get my headphones in the burnout camera. The only difference this time is I, I

32
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:46,679
don't have a bathroom on. All right. I've updated the stream. All right. Who's ready to go find this

33
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:57,580
spy. You know what I love the most about anything is when monitors have touch-based fucking controls

34
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:14,789
on them that don't work like 60% of the time. I love that so much. I love it. I'm using the

35
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:22,460
Xbox. That's not the right controller. What, what happened to the other one? All right, let's go.

36
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:33,779
Ow. Let's do it. 2012 Family Feud. I want to do a test to make sure I've synced everything up.

37
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:47,110
You guys are going to have to help me here. I'm not going to play David. David sucks.

38
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,649
You're doing that thing where you can make me sit and look like I think David sucks.

39
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:19,669
Okay. You ready? Two, three, one, two, one, two, one, two, three, four. Boomer avatar. What are we

40
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:29,590
talking about? How are we doing? Good. Challenge. Beach party, high seas, rock and roll, fiesta.

41
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:43,509
Beach party. Medium. I pick the, do I have to pick my family? I have to, I'm assimilating myself

42
00:11:43,509 --> 00:12:06,820
into another family. Who's the host? No host. No licensing fee for a host. I'm the only one in the

43
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:19,659
family. I, it's just me. Where's my whole family? Oh shit. Our flights got all fucked up, but they

44
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:28,970
still had to tape the show. Your score points for every top answer you give for these surveys.

45
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:36,100
If you give me an answer that's not on the board, I'll give you a strike. When you have three

46
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,659
strikes, the other family can try to steal your points. The family with a top score after four

47
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:47,139
rounds gets to play for a twenty thousand dollar prize. How do we do that with just me though?

48
00:12:51,899 --> 00:13:08,200
The Kelps versus Tended D Rangoon's family. I guess I'll do it. Why do I have my avatar?

49
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,570
Answers on the board. The best answer gives you control of the board.

50
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:23,370
And how it works. In the buzzer to answer. We asked 100 people, name someone who might knock

51
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:40,460
on your hotel room door. Cleaning person. Quick answer. Clean. A clergyman.

52
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,659
Like that answer. A clergyman is going to come knock on your door.

53
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:54,710
It fills in the blank. It's like an auto correct.

54
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:08,330
All right, who could knock on the door? I think I'm going to play it. Yep. We're talking about

55
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:20,659
security. Room service. Pizza guy. All right, who might knock on the hotel room door?

56
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:38,580
We're talking about a security. A secretary of defense. What?

57
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:50,379
How could security? Okay, room service is another day on the one I was going to say.

58
00:14:53,690 --> 00:15:02,870
Roofer. Room service. All right, some tiny answer. I don't know what it's going to be though.

59
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:18,330
One strike. Knock on your door. The front desk? Delivery? Like a delivery, right?

60
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:40,019
All right, that's... Plumber? Why would a plumber? Pizza? Wouldn't pizza be delivery? Like pizza

61
00:15:40,019 --> 00:16:03,460
delivery delivery? Repair? Like maintenance. Why am I not getting an answer here? Repair guy.

62
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:14,330
See that answer. God. That's three strikes. There's a chance for a steal.

63
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:23,320
You can steal all those points just by giving me an answer on the board. I'll repeat the question

64
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:33,190
for you. So what is it then? I think pizza delivery person. Is that answer on the board?

65
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:45,500
I said delivery. I win, motherfuckers. Your family wins the round.

66
00:16:47,850 --> 00:17:02,019
Why Beach Party? Bellboy. All right. The manager. Those two out of a hundred are the ones that got

67
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:09,859
complained on. I would think it would be more than two percent of people that had their radios too

68
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:23,589
loud in their hotel room. Six answers. Give the best answer and take charge of the board.

69
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:31,559
Buzz in to answer. Here's the question. We are your family. According to women,

70
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:37,720
what is the most beautiful thing you have? What do you mean you have? What do you mean you have?

71
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:51,480
Like me? You're in a hurry. You have. Kids. I like that answer. Let's check the board.

72
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,440
Kids, number one. The most beautiful thing that you have are kids. It's your choice.

73
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:09,500
I mean, I was going to say. Do you want to play or pass? 2018 Lamborghini Porsche.

74
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,500
That thing's fucking, that's a beautiful car. You'll let the other family take it from here.

75
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:25,059
I have no idea what these answers are. Oh, okay. What is the most beautiful thing you have?

76
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:47,750
I'd say dog. A dog. A dog. Dogs. Pets. All right. You got a beautiful dog. Okay. House? I'm just

77
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,430
trying to think of what people would say. Oh, you've got a beautiful home. You've got a beautiful

78
00:18:51,430 --> 00:19:04,039
house. You've got a beautiful house key. Houses? Houses. You've got a beautiful kids. You've got

79
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:23,319
a beautiful home. You've got a beautiful dog. You've got a beautiful life? Car? Yard. You've

80
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:35,460
got a beautiful yard. Why can't I just do yard? Why does it have to be yard stick? You have a

81
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:44,359
beautiful, I was going to say smile. Beautiful smile. Look at you. What nice teeth. Two strikes

82
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:56,680
now. What nice teeth you have. What beautiful teeth you have. What's the werewolf grandmother?

83
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,440
What'd she say? Beautiful what? Beautiful eyes. My, what beautiful eyes you have. My, what beautiful

84
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:22,410
teeth you have, right? All the better to see you with. All the better to, okay, what is the most

85
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:36,180
beautiful thing you have? A ring? Hair. That's a good one. Hair. Your beautiful health insurance.

86
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:51,690
Good answer. Smile. And then I have no idea what one person said. No, it's not smile. I can't even

87
00:20:51,690 --> 00:21:05,740
get it wrong. Muscles? Skin? Teeth? Did we do teeth? What beautiful, beautiful teeth.

88
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:19,160
Show me the answer. What? The board has it.

89
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:27,079
Only one answer left. Beautiful teething ring. That's considered jewelry. What's the last one?

90
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:39,579
Oh wow, everything like that. Your molars are coming in really good, Nancy. Beautiful clothes?

91
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:52,220
Clones? Cloth? Oh shit, I'm gonna run out of time. Clothes for the gym. Fuck, I didn't press A.

92
00:21:52,940 --> 00:22:05,450
Time for the steal. Teething ring. They're not gonna get it. The points are yours for the taking.

93
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:13,140
Just give me an answer from the board. We're talking about. All right, there's no way.

94
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,859
There's only two people that said anything. One person. Dresses. Does that steal the points? I

95
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:25,779
don't know why you went cross-eyed. Nope. I'll take it. No, the other family keeps the points.

96
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:37,240
The other family wins the round. What are the other answers? It's less than three.

97
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:44,099
This was answer number six. Shoes. We're doubling the score for round three.

98
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:56,890
Let's keep this going. I need one player from each team. These animations are weird. It's

99
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,769
almost like they overly mo-capped them or something. The top five answers are on the board.

100
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,849
This is the type of way you're supposed to perform on a stage for a play.

101
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,009
You're supposed to over-annunciate, over-act so people can see you.

102
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:15,900
We asked 100 people if you hired a gourmet chef to cook for you,

103
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,220
name a complaint he might have about your kitchen.

104
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:39,160
No, you shitty olive oil. You're too small. Like that answer. Let's see. There it is. Number one.

105
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:47,799
That's the number one answer. Not enough tools, not enough ingredients. They're not fresh. You have

106
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:56,150
like frozen ground beef in the freezer. You have your pantries just full of the same brand of

107
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:03,130
spaghetti and it was like the get 10 for $10 spaghetti deal. I don't know if I want to do

108
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:22,579
this one. You're going to pass. They're not going to get it. A microwave. Is that on the board?

109
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:35,269
Nope. Because a lot of places use them. I got to be ready for a steel though. I'm going to say

110
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:42,390
ingredients. Counter space. I said small. Did I pick easy? This is medium, right? What do you mean

111
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:56,150
counter space? Because the counter space is small. What will complain? The light? It's too dark in

112
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:07,430
here? Holy shit, that was a dumb answer. Okay, the knives. Ingredients. Your tools. Your utensils

113
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:18,630
are bad. Your ingredients are bad. That's going to be tools. It's dirty. Dirty. Yeah, I think dirty.

114
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:28,420
Now you have to watch out. Fuck. Stole that. Show us the answer.

115
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:38,470
Dammit. All right, what's the one that one or two people said? Fill in the blank. Ingredients. It

116
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,380
has to be. Like low quality. It's warm in here. All right, this is the opportunity. What is it?

117
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:53,140
Rats and pests? No. That's your third strike. Oh shit. Okay, what is it? It's ingredients.

118
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:01,079
You can steal all those points just by giving me an answer. Low quality. Not fresh.

119
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:33,589
Ingredients. No. Quality. Frozen. No. Oh no. It smells in there. Spices. Is that answer on the board?

120
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:46,170
The other family keeps the points. Fine, we have our winner for the round.

121
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:54,470
The other answers are? You know, I really would like this if you didn't,

122
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,309
if you would just stop spitting in the food. Each answer is worth triple.

123
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:10,619
Let's keep this going. I need one. Stove. I don't like your stove. Isn't counter space in small?

124
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:18,299
All right, I got to do this. The top five answers are on the board. Give the best answer and take

125
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:24,619
charge of the board. The stove is a stove. They're all the same damn thing. Here's the question.

126
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:33,210
Name a word or phrase that begins with the word string. Cheese. Don't let me stop you. String

127
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:48,710
cheese. String theory. I'll get all these. Sounds good to me. I'll take that. String.

128
00:27:53,660 --> 00:28:01,029
String theory. String. It's your choice. I don't know other than two of these. Do you want to play

129
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:21,180
or pass? String bean. String bean. Let's keep going. I'm going to string theory because I said

130
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:33,740
that immediately. Is it up there? Why is it funny? I don't know. The word string bean is funny. I

131
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:48,859
don't know why. It is. Excellent. There are no strikes on the board. String beans. Did that just

132
00:28:48,859 --> 00:29:04,470
say string bingus? String cheese. String cheese. String. Like a violin. String violin. String

133
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:34,099
instrument. All right, what is this last one? String. Guitar. String. String quartet. That's

134
00:29:34,099 --> 00:30:01,670
not a bad idea. Thank you, family. Is that right? Uh oh. That's strike one. String bikini. Is it on

135
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:12,579
the board? Uh oh. Guys. That's strike two. String bikini. String quartet. String instrument. String.

136
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:24,779

942
03:18:56,159 --> 03:19:01,579

943
03:19:01,579 --> 03:19:06,299
the dot to dot and random little jokes and shit it's just a thing for fun just a little community

944
03:19:06,299 --> 03:19:12,620
night where people submitted stuff and i do little puzzles on stream and little activity book stuff

945
03:19:12,620 --> 03:19:20,659
that the community has made the where's waldo segment if you don't even if you don't know what

946
03:19:20,659 --> 03:19:30,750
that means people have to make an image where they have i have to find me in the image where's

947
03:19:30,750 --> 03:19:38,020
waldo's style and the only thing i get to do is i have to sit i will have a webcam on i'll have

948
03:19:38,020 --> 03:19:44,659
to sit at least two feet away from the monitor but i get to use the windows magnifying glass

949
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:59,059
that's a stipulation that i get to have no two feet away from the monitor windows magnifying glass

950

952
03:20:32,399 --> 03:20:52,860

953
03:20:52,860 --> 03:20:58,059

954
03:20:58,059 --> 03:21:06,139
you like voices and characters and it's charlie adler it's if you look up to you'll know who he

but it's like actual inspiration at least in i don't know if you want to use the words

959
03:21:52,209 --> 03:21:56,290
who did you want to emulate when you were watching cartoons and tv shows it would be him

965
03:22:58,340 --> 03:23:02,500
ago that you plan on playing classic wow and making a guild for us i wonder when you think

966
03:23:02,500 --> 03:23:06,420
you'll set that up as i wouldn't mind playing but i need to know what server thanks for the laughs

967
03:23:07,139 --> 03:23:16,979
we made a joke about that earlier and i didn't realize so i i try i it's a long time to go from

968
03:23:16,979 --> 03:23:24,399
like one to even from like one to 20 in classic wow is a long ass time and i'm not sure i can

969
03:23:24,399 --> 03:23:35,569
like put the necessary time into doing that it's an interesting thing that i want to do but i don't

970
03:23:35,569 --> 03:23:49,579
like have time to do it right now maybe when all the dust settles i just don't i don't i'm not i

971
03:23:49,579 --> 03:23:54,059
don't have like the really the time to play wow right now and i thought i was going to but then

972
03:23:54,059 --> 03:24:02,299
that was also before some of these big streams came up germa lied about classic wow yep i do

973
03:24:06,190 --> 03:24:13,059
sorry for adding you on xbox please don't delete your account i'm not gonna i just hit 20 the other

974
03:24:13,059 --> 03:24:20,190
day and i had like 24 hours played yeah so it's a commitment especially if you want to do anything

975
03:24:20,270 --> 03:24:28,610
that's you know not picking up squirrel blood hoarder alliance i always played alliance

976
03:24:29,250 --> 03:24:38,909
and that really only is because i liked the way that the humans left the human laugh was like the

977
03:24:38,909 --> 03:24:45,540
biggest dick move if you know if you ganked somebody or like you got in a fight with a

978
03:24:45,540 --> 03:24:49,860
horde and it was you could just sit there you just typed slash lol when they died

979
03:24:49,860 --> 03:25:10,579
it was just like that motherfucker nobody had a laugh like the human alliance ganking omega low

980
03:25:20,799 --> 03:25:27,500
oh the gnome too the gnome laugh i based who i played on is how their laugh was the gnome that

981
03:25:27,500 --> 03:25:39,809
like it's like you nobody can do it you can't replicate it but maybe i don't know i i can't

982
03:25:39,809 --> 03:25:44,209
say definitively if i'm gonna do that if i really get into it i really actually start playing

983
03:25:45,090 --> 03:25:52,110
