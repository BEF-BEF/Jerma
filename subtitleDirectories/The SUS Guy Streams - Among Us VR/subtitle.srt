1
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:29,210
What's up? Oh, should I have to mute myself in here? I don't know how to do that. Hold on.

2
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,329
All right, I think I know how to do it. Okay, I think I'm muted in the game. How you doing? Hi,

3
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:52,149
everybody. Welcome. Welcome to a VR stream. You know, I made a few promises, and I'm going to

4
00:00:52,149 --> 00:01:03,020
keep those promises. So what we're doing today is we're going to act a little bit sus today.

5
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,099
Playing Among Us VR, the sus guy is finally fucking going to stream this game. I hope you're ready.

6
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,659
I've rebranded the whole channel. And no, I didn't put any sub badges in because I know what you

7
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:25,420
guys would do. You would you would go to every channel on Twitch and ruin the whole website.

8
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:36,420
So we're not doing that today. There's tons of BT TV emotes. Why not? Because it would be a disaster.

9
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:45,400
And on my mics, I'm still I got COVID still. So I've never played this game. I did the

10
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,680
tutorial really quickly. So all I know is that if I'm the imposter, I have to kill people.

11
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,359
And if I'm a crewmate, then I have to stop the imposter from killing everybody.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:07,109
Is everybody ready to get sus? I think we're still setting the lobby up. But hi. He did the

13
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:17,990
tutorial. Yeah. And this is one day only, by the way. I'm not doing this ever again. Make sure I

14
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:27,560
tweet this. Yeah, I ain't ever doing this ever again. Every emote that you're spamming right

15
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,800
now, everything that you're doing, every single joke that you're making is not going to be allowed

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:50,069
as of tomorrow. One day only. Watch me be really good at this game. It's only a one day event. It

17
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:57,830
really is. Yeah. I have to make sure I don't show the lobby code too. That would be so the the lobby

18
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:06,150
I'm in right now. It's Kraken Vinnie Ross. There's a bunch of people in here. And I think we're just

19
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,729
kind of chilling. Waiting to start. I'm muted right now in the game. But I'm gonna annoy,

20
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,129
I'm gonna annoy the fuck out of everybody in this lobby, I can already tell you.

21
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,939
I think, I think I'm, is something wrong? I think I'm breaking the game or something.

22
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,689
Yeah, they're talking to me in the game. Hold on. All right, so it's time to get sus.

23
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:44,889
Can you guys hear them? All right, I gotta make sure I don't show the room code. Hold on.

24
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:56,409
Oh, good. We got 10 subs. We got way more than 10. Hold on. I don't want to show the lobby.

25
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:12,360
Hold on. Okay. Hey, everybody, what's going on to be the sus guy? I'm doing the Deadpool voice.

26
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,199
All right, hold on. I know before I just gonna make sure you can't see the lobby code.

27
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,379
Because that's a really important thing. First of all, I got to unmute myself here.

28
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:27,750
Okay, I'm currently unmuted. I'm currently I'm ready. I don't want to stare at a wall,

29
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,069
though, because I don't want to look at the room code. Okay, so here we go.

30
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,310
Hold on. I can turn, you apparently can turn off the hands disappearing. Oh,

31
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:45,180
oh my God. Yes, you can. Okay. All right. Hey, don't show the room code. Fucking idiot.

32
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,170
I can't, I can't be trusted. I really can't. I have to just look at the wall. Something's

33
00:04:50,170 --> 00:05:00,019
in my eye already. How did it get in my eye? Oh, this is pretty sus.

34
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,870
Okay. Hi, guys.

35
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:24,069
Let's go. Okay, I don't want to see the room code. Hi, everybody. Hi, guys.

36
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,750
What's up? Are you ready to play some among us? I'm ready. I'm ready. All right. You look kind of

37
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:45,939
cool. There we go. It's so tiny. So how do you play? Anybody know how to play this game?

38
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,579
I didn't play the tutorial, man. I have no idea. Can that can you just point? You just point?

39
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,259
Okay. It's pretty nice. Oh, you can point. That's what you do. So you. So how do you,

40
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,339
how do we, is it just, do we just roll Dyson who gets to play as, you know, the imposter?

41
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,740
Pretty much. Ever played D&D? It's kind of like that. Oh my God. You make a triangle.

42
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,060
Do we get to, can we, do we get to roll who gets to be the imposter or does it just pick a random

43
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,939
person? I think it just picks random person every game. Picks two people. Purple is probably my top

44
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,980
three. How many people do we have? There's other people over here. It's number two for sure. Hey.

45
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:39,699
Oh, I just did. It's me. One day only, by the way. This is the only day. This is the only day

46
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,860
I'm going to allow it. Yeah. Are you ready to like get kicked out first every single round?

47
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:52,339
Because literally the only bit. Sorry. What's the point of that? Are you, are you feeling?

48
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:57,060
This thing's too tight. This thing's too tight on my hands. Okay. Yeah. It's a big in my like

49
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:05,860
handshake. There we go. That's better. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. So are we, are we ready to rock and roll?

50
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,860
Are we ready to rock and roll? Hey, I think we're ready. Are we double turns?

51
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:19,459
By the way, subscriptions are appreciated today. Look at him. He's a little shit.

52
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,300
I don't even know how to do this. I, I, I, I feel, I feel so fucking out of my element right now.

53
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,300
I'm going to be very honest. You can mute yourself if you want by pressing the little

54
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:43,459
mic button. I feel like I shouldn't be here. I appreciate that. Tell everybody. Remember.

55
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
It's true. Hey, you know what? Thank you. How about let's establish some backstory. What are

56
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,060
we all doing here? Thank you, Vinny. Let's start with you. Okay. What are you doing? I think I'm

57
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:02,100
sent to do the arboretum. I want to regrow the props. Very good. Would you like to join me in

58
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,579
this charboard? Of course. Yeah. I have a side objective though. I'm killing everybody regardless

59
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:11,620
of if I'm imposter or not. So keep that in mind as we move forward. Are we playing right now?

60
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,420
Establishing some like stakes, you know, before we go. Oh, I thought we were playing right.

61
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,180
I thought somebody was already the imposter.

62
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:30,980
We could be. We could decide who's the imposter. Regardless. Yeah. Yeah. Democracy.

63
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,500
I mean, aside from sus guy trying to get subs.

64
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,419
Do you, if you go to my story. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. I don't want to cut anybody off.

65
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:50,500
I, I'm the captain of a previous vessel that crashed and I was abandoned on a space station

66
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,860
and I, and I had to say goodbye to my, my loved ones and I got abducted by this one and I'm trying

67
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,500
to prove to y'all I'm the captain, but actually I don't have any credentials with me. So, you know,

68
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:08,740
that's the thing. I remember you. Hold on a second. I'll do better this time. Are you related to

69
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,340
Tinky Winky from the Teletubbies? I'll never tell. Okay.

70
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,419
Yeah, that looks awfully like a TV there in the middle of your screen. Yeah.

71
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,179
Maybe they're all just weird. And my TV is just my eyes actually.

72
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,259
All right. Are we ready to, are we ready to rock and roll? Are we ready to rock?

73
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,580
Anyone else that wants to join, they'll join in next round. Okay. Yeah. Good luck everybody.

74
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,220
It's going to work. Hey, be careful. If it's you, if I'm the imposter, I'm killing you first.

75
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:54,330
Wait, don't say any sounds. We can still hear everybody. Hi everybody. I'm muting. Mute,

76
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,559
mute, mute, mute, mute. What do I do when my screen is red and has a kill? What does the

77
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:10,950
kill button do? Hey. Yeah. Don't mind me guys. He's red. Get away from me. Oh my God. This is so

78
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:16,149
weird. What do we have to do? Oh, this mission's right. Like I'm just trying to do my task, but

79
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,750
now I'm tall because I'm standing, but if I'm sitting, I'm too small. Vinny, I'm coming with

80
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:26,389
you. I feel like if we're doing tasks, got a pump, pump it. How do you pump with your hands?

81
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:32,809
Don't stand so close to me. My big yaoi hands. I don't know how to do this. Pretend I never said

82
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:38,649
that. Yeah. I'm just going to go with that. I got it. Grab with the trigger and then pump, pump, pump.

83
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:46,250
I did it. Okay. Unless you're sus. No, no, no, no. I got it now. I got it. Oh, fuck. I'm muted. I

84
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,750
forgot. I've been muted this whole time.

85
00:10:49,750 --> 00:11:33,019
So nobody can hear me.

86
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:40,220
But dude, I walked away from that corner. I said I was going to kill him first, by the way. That's

87
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,820
the funniest part about this. You did walk away. My first game ever. I fucking die immediately

88
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:56,950
within 15 seconds. 15 seconds. Get rid of him. Get rid of him. Get rid of him. I'm the ghost of

89
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:10,330
the fucking sus guy. And I'm going to make sure they pick you. Did I play? Did I play wrong there?

90
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:20,820
He's no way. He's going to get voted on.

91
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,690
Who are they voting for?

92
00:12:41,929 --> 00:13:02,250
Bastards. That was so funny. That was so funny. I mean, I was literally pointing in your face

93
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,850
saying I'm going to kill you first and you fucking killed me in 10 seconds.

94
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:22,620
I figured the best way to get you acclimated to Among Us was to kill you instantly.

95
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:31,700
This game is kind of fun. Yeah, it's going to be good. We just have to betray each other and then

96
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,100
you know ruin friendships and it'll be great. Yeah, that's all right.

97
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:59,110
Who's the other imposter? Oh, it doesn't show you? We have tasks. Oh shit. How do we do tasks?

98
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,129
I have to like look around the corner and make sure it's coming.

99
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:16,009
Oh, there's a task in here. All right, so let's do some tasks. Let me get acclimated by this.

100
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:20,860
How does this work? Okay, so what do we have to do? Yeah, well, we're dead. We can't do tasks.

101
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,659
I'm dead, guys. I'm dead. What's happening? Did you vote for me? I did not. I skipped the vote.

102
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:37,899
I do it. Did I do it? You do tasks. Do tasks, people are saying. Liars. Do tasks.

103
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,740
I guess you do. Yeah, you can contribute. All right, I'm going to go navigation.

104
00:14:52,779 --> 00:15:08,419
What happened? I'm going to do my tasks. I give up dead instantly. That's so funny.

105
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,389
That's absolutely poetic. All right, we're going to head this way.

106
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:21,700
That's a fucking imposter. I guarantee it. Yeah, there's no task done in here.

107
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:33,590
There's an imposter right there. Did I fail it? Oh, I see. I gotta get it right in the middle.

108
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:50,549
Done. Who's he talking to? Oh, we're all streaming. I forgot. I completely forgot.

109
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:55,500
Everybody's streaming right now. What else is there to do?

110
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,139
I feel like it's hard to get people alone, right? You have to get somebody kind of going down like

111
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:38,120
a hall. And you have to be the very worst version of yourself. You have to be the sus guy.

112
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,379
Oh, don't worry. I'm ready. I mean, if anybody in this lobby ever wants to talk to me again,

113
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:52,490
I understand. You know what I mean? I want someone to trust you, says a chat member. Absolutely do

114
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,769
not say you can trust me.

115
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:08,660
Become the sus guy. I mean, I kind of sound like him because I am him.

116
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:12,579
Somebody said hit the Luddie. All right. How do you do it?

117
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:22,119
Yeah. Oh, so we can sabotage when they start going again. If you use your map,

118
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:28,839
you can still do tasks because you're regular. That's zero practice, by the way.

119
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,779
This is bizarre. Hearing their voices like this. Yeah, it feels weird.

120
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:40,099
It feels like my head's under water.

121
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,259
Robert, we saw you. You poked your little head in. You saw us and then you ducked out

122
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:52,019
and then you reported it. Oh, was that what? Impostor got displeaded.

123
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:02,339
What's going on here? That's all you can do. Why are they talking like this?

124
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,980
Yeah, it's a little. It feels weird. Emergency meeting.

125
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:30,950
It was a little spooky. It was a little scary. All right. We were all scared. All right.

126
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,230
Maybe his body just did that. Have we considered that? Who is it?

127
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,150
Who killed you? I don't know. Who killed you?

128
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,869
Oh, Vinny. Maybe it was natural causes. Maybe it was heart fatigue or something.

129
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,789
I killed you and they immediately sussed me out in a room that's that way.

130
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,029
It scared the absolute shit out of me, too. I was not expecting it at all.

131
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,230
I was like, oh, I can trust Vinny. I'm going to follow Vinny. I was muted, but that's what I was

132
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:06,619
saying. No, that was perfect. I'm not good at this, OK?

133
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,049
So the check could definitely spoil things for us. I don't know where I am.

134
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:33,910
Oh, OK. Terrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Achievement. I got an achievement.

135
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,890
Play again, right? Yeah. Don't look at the lobby.

136
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,250
My only game of Among Us Impostor. I'm going to quit now.

137
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:49,049
I got my one win. No, OK. The one win. It's awful.

138
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:56,650
You feel the guilt. It's terrible. Did you hit the Yankee Splanky? All right.

139
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,130
I was in a room alone with you and I felt bad. You did a very good job, though.

140
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,250
You did an insane job because we didn't even vote to win the first round.

141
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,170
Yeah, I'm very surprised. How about the hit the sussy? You got it.

142
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:13,049
We're good, though. What happened to my height? Why are my hands so high?

143
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,490
It was cold. It sounds like I'm listening to robots. It's loud.

144
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,329
I can turn everything down. It's very loud.

145
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:39,299
How's that better? That sound better?

146
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:42,579
There it is. Better?

147
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,460
So, I only have one hand. Now imagine that.

148
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,740
Better? OK. Hide the room code?

149
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,339
I don't see people. Oh.

150
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:56,819
Thank you. The other one is like, was it on the ceiling or on the floor?

151
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,819
Yo, yo, yo. Dab me up. Dab me up. I could do it right here.

152
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:03,779
Bam. You got it. Yeah, good dab. Good dab. Good dab.

153
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,500
I got to psych myself up. OK, maybe not like that.

154
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,420
Oh, my God. Maybe so.

155
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,500
If you get imposter, you're going to fucking do it, man.

156
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,259
Yeah, this is pretty good. You can imposter.

157
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:17,059
Oh, I don't know what happened. I don't know. He died.

158
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,660
He fell down. He fell down. I don't know what happened.

159
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,539
He hit his head. I got it. What's up?

160
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,019
How are you doing over here? A little weird that you're talking alone.

161
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:27,910
I'm just trying to figure out what I want to be and do.

162
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,029
OK, I'm making sure. I'm making history right now.

163
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,430
I'll trust him. I know. I'm trying.

164
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,190
Hey, how do I hide the room code?

165
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,190
I've been looking at the ground.

166
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,819
Gameplay and then scroll down.

167
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,500
Will it show it if I look at the screen?

168
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,619
I like the little moving in place. It's so funny.

169
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,460
Gameplay. Show. OK.

170
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,460
OK, I don't think I showed it. I've been looking down.

171
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:03,180
I tried to walk over to my water in VR. Hold on.

172
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,940
No, that's not how that works. Oh, I got a drink too.

173
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,900
Oh, that's pretty sus.

174
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,099
Oh, God. Where's the my wisdom?

175
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,119
Who is he? He is COVID.

176
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,759
Sorry, guys. I was acting a little sus.

177
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,789
OK, hold on. Hold on. Stay back from him.

178
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,589
What? I mean, you have COVID, don't you?

179
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:34,630
Do you have COVID? Yeah.

180
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,029
Six feet, guys. What?

181
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:41,190
Hey, where'd you get that? We got a gas mask, man.

182
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,269
We need to spread those around.

183
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,789
No, I'm good. Yeah, actually, I'm good.

184
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:47,109
I've got a mask on. I can be in.

185
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,230
Really? It's OK.

186
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,950
Dude, I just today lost the ability to taste and smell, though.

187
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,430
That sucks.

188
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:59,019
It sucks. I feel all right, though.

189
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,140
If you get tinnitus, please let me know,

190
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,220
because I think I have long COVID tinnitus.

191
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,420
I hear it in my ear for the past fucking two months now.

192
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:07,980
That sucks.

193
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:09,819
It's fine. All right.

194
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:12,859
Well, how about I don't want to be like a downer on the lobby.

195
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,059
Like, oh, yeah, man.

196
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,059
Sucks so bad. Everything.

197
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,019
What is your body scent?

198
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:22,619
Mine's like a constant ringing.

199
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:23,180
That's right.

200
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,900
Is it jolly?

201
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,779
It's always good to be numb while playing Among Us VR at most.

202
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,259
Oh, boy. Are you jolly?

203
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:29,819
So far.

204
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:32,059
No, I feel good, though. I feel better.

205
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,900
Setting the main audio this fucking loud.

206
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,460
OK, I'm almost done.

207
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,140
Yeah, I know. I know, dude. I know.

208
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,099
It's insane how bad.

209
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:37,660
What's out here?

210
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:42,619
Also, your name may need your white.

211
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:44,700
He's white.

212
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,299
I am a bit of a white boy, which is white.

213
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:51,259
Yeah, this is jolly wanker, everybody.

214
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:54,220
So we just got to get his name proper.

215
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,180
I just want to see what people were saying.

216
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,299
What's my name?

217
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,299
If you open up the in-game menu thing,

218
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,779
with one of those little jump buttons that you'd use in VR chat.

219
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,579
Yeah, and like the bottom right, there's a gear.

220
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:04,380
And then you go.

221
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,259
I like that beak.

222
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,700
And then there's like a second page that you can go on to.

223
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,059
And there's like, hide my username.

224
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,220
Oh, yeah.

225
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,660
You can also turn off hiding.

226
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,220
What do you do?

227
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:18,299
There you go.

228
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:18,700
There you go.

229
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,619
Oh, you have a little plant up.

230
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:21,420
What do I have?

231
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,980
There we go.

232
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:23,339
Nice to meet you, too.

233
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:24,140
Nice to meet you, too.

234
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,779
We should be the first in Among Us VR to have a cool handshake.

235
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,660
Yeah, no.

236
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,259
Wait, are they doing that or are we doing that?

237
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:30,980
Wait.

238
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,619
Oh, I thought you were talking to me.

239
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,220
Sorry.

240
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:35,339
I'm sorry.

241
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,059
I'm almost 40.

242
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,549
Grand father.

243
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:57,589
How many people do we have?

244
00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:59,750
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

245
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,390
We got nine people.

246
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,670
First person to turkey in Among Us VR.

247
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:04,950
OK, let's go.

248
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,190
You can't hear it, but I'm clapping.

249
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,990
You have to yell turkey.

250
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,710
Oh, I see it.

251
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,670
I get it.

252
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,309
Turkey.

253
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:10,809
Wow.

254
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,619
Every single person over there.

255
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,940
You better be ready.

256
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,640
If I get imposter this round, first time ever,

257
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:26,339
it's going to be gun over.

258
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,339
How we go?

259
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,140
Are we good to rock and roll?

260
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:36,509
Oh.

261
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,950
First person to stub their toe in Among Us VR.

262
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,910
Who is he talking to?

263
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:47,990
I'm talking to you guys.

264
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,190
I'm talking to the chat room.

265
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,190
Why don't I just say it like that?

266
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,990
It's really taken over.

267
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,029
How many subs do we have so far?

268
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,859
How many subs?

269
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:56,259
Let's see.

270
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,059
I don't know, at least 10.

271
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,140
I have to update that.

272
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,640
Hey.

273
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,859
What's happening?

274
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:07,619
This stream totally isn't going the way you thought it was going to go, is it?

275
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:09,539
Well, I died in 10 seconds the first round ever.

276
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:11,849
It was not.

277
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,900
It's impossible to have a conversation with anybody.

278
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,309
Especially your chat room.

279
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:19,430
All right, we're getting out.

280
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,470
So what do you want to talk about in the three seconds that we have together?

281
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,269
All right, we're starting.

282
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:25,609
Good luck.

283
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:27,369
All right.

284
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:34,150
Oh, boy.

285
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,960
Okay.

286
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,440
Anyone feeling, anyone feeling,

287
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,160
admitted now, admitted now, before we start, before we start,

288
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
anyone feeling a little suspicious right now?

289
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,299
Not yet.

290
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,900
Not me.

291
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,500
No one?

292
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,400
I'll get back to you on that.

293
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,960
I'm taking a mental note of where every single fucking person goes.

294
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,460
What?

295
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,079
I thought somebody killed me.

296
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,599
I was like, how?

297
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Who did that?

298
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,940
What?

299
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
I don't really have like two emergency meetings.

300
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,880
How many emergency meetings?

301
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,839
Yeah, we're using our first one for a dumb bit.

302
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,519
I think it's one per person.

303
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,200
How do we skip?

304
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,180
I am skipping.

305
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:36,859
I'm skipping.

306
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,839
I'm telling you, you got to see where everybody walks, right?

307
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:45,720
Somebody goes that way.

308
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,519
Somebody goes that way.

309
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,400
Somebody goes that way.

310
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,680
I'm going to just watch.

311
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,640
Okay, I'm good.

312
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,140
I'm okay.

313
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,480
We're fine.

314
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,279
All right, I'm skipping.

315
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,660
Hey, Vinny.

316
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,339
Hey, Vinny.

317
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,339
Why would I do that?

318
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,230
All right, in the menu, do you have your mic?

319
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,630
I'm going to do my tasks, okay?

320
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,349
Somebody follow him.

321
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:25,849
You too.

322
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,119
Somebody follow Blue.

323
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:31,240
Is this like a choice that you've made to be mute or is this?

324
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,440
Vinny and Liam, you follow Criken.

325
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,970
I got my eyes on Blue.

326
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,049
He can't speak, but I'm sure he agrees.

327
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:46,039
All right, I'm coming with you guys.

328
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,079
Don't leave me alone.

329
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,799
Why am I going that way?

330
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:48,920
Don't leave me alone with Vinny.

331
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,640
Wait, what?

332
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,039
Oh, shit.

333
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,960
What do I do?

334
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,440
What?

335
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,480
Okay, straight.

336
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:57,519
Oh, my.

337
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,579
This sucks.

338
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:07,720
Can I fight back?

339
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,200
Hey, what's up?

340
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,119
What's going on?

341
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,119
I've never played this game.

342
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,640
I don't know what room is what room.

343
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:20,859
I was going to navigation because I want it.

344
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,819
I'm going to navigation.

345
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,619
No, you guys, all two of you, come with me if you want.

346
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:25,119
It's fine.

347
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,059
But I want you to get in front of me.

348
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,299
Yeah, sure, sure.

349
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:31,019
You know what?

350
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:31,819
I got nothing to prove.

351
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:32,539
I got nothing to hide.

352
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:33,099
Go ahead.

353
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:34,140
We can watch the door.

354
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,859
We'll watch the door.

355
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:35,900
You take care of your tasks.

356
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,019
No one's coming through this.

357
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:37,420
You're safe.

358
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,059
It's these two.

359
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:39,339
It's definitely these two.

360
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:40,220
It's these two.

361
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,180
It's definitely these two.

362
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,140
It's definitely these two.

363
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,859
It's these two.

364
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,140
No, it's these two.

365
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,779
It's these two.

366
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,000
Help!

367
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,819
I found imposters.

368
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,339
I found the imposters.

369
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:49,839
I found them.

370
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,660
I found the imposter.

371
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:54,140
I don't know what room I'm in.

372
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:57,420
What?

373
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,900
No.

374
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,980
You don't tell anybody.

375
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,099
I won't tell anybody.

376
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:01,740
I won't tell anybody.

377
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,299
Just let me live.

378
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,420
You're fine for now.

379
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:05,740
All right.

380
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,539
OK, OK, OK.

381
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:07,660
We're good.

382
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,140
OK.

383
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,619
We're good.

384
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:09,180
We're good.

385
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,380
Go on, go on.

386
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,019
Oh, shit.

387
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,559
Emergency!

388
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,240
Emergency meeting!

389
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:18,920
Emergency meeting!

390
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,740
Hey!

391
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,380
I'm back here.

392
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,900
Hold on.

393
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:27,099
Wait a second.

394
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,539
You're fine.

395
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:29,579
Take your time.

396
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:29,980
Take your time.

397
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,859
Get some water.

398
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:35,440
Did you see what he's doing?

399
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,000
A panic attack?

400
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,559
What's going on?

401
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,519
Listen.

402
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,319
You think it's him.

403
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,400
I was walking around.

404
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,240
I don't know how to play this game, right?

405
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,789
And fuck, I forgot their names.

406
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,369
OK.

407
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:49,049
So what's your name?

408
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:50,890
Green here.

409
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,240
And what's your name?

410
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,680
Green and yellow cornered me.

411
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,640
All right.

412
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,319
Green and yellow cornered me.

413
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,000
It's above my head.

414
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,240
OK.

415
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,200
Listen, listen, listen.

416
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,839
Listen, important.

417
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,880
We have a name tag.

418
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,119
They were chasing me around, screaming at me and shit.

419
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,720
And they were like, hey, don't tell anybody.

420
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,960
And I was like fucking running for my life and screaming.

421
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,920
It's these two.

422
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,799
Or at least it's one of them.

423
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,160
That does not sound like something I would do.

424
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,720
One task.

425
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,359
Do one task.

426
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,000
I went.

427
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,240
OK.

428
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,880
Are you alive?

429
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,240
I went to go do a task.

430
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,519
And they both got like weirdly in a triangle pattern behind me.

431
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,559
And I'm just sitting there going like.

432
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,559
I'm like, why are they doing this?

433
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,839
Why are they doing this?

434
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,519
So it has to be these two.

435
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,839
It's Charborg and Philboat.

436
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,839
You're making a big mistake if you listen to him.

437
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,880
Don't listen to where that guy's coming from.

438
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,599
I'm telling you right now.

439
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,559
I've known Charborg for years.

440
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,119
And he's never done anything suspect whatsoever.

441
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,160
No, no, no, no, no.

442
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,880
I'm a nice guy.

443
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,000
You said I was yelling at you.

444
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,440
It's impossible that there's something going on.

445
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,559
I was being chased.

446
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,279
If you vote one of us out and it doesn't show the imposter thing gone.

447
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,319
That's insane.

448
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,039
That's insane.

449
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,519
Oh, we got five seconds of voting.

450
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,160
I'm telling you.

451
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,960
It's these two.

452
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,440
What's going on?

453
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,640
This is insanity.

454
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,359
No, don't skip.

455
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:56,680
I'm telling you.

456
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,480
They chased me around.

457
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:57,880
It was weird.

458
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,519
It was scary.

459
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,960
Because it's funny.

460
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, I'm still alive.

461
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,279
OK.

462
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,079
You're still alive.

463
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:05,640
That's true.

464
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,440
That's what matters.

465
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,079
Am I loud?

466
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,839
I'm going to go take care of my task, guys.

467
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,200
I think we're just getting bullied.

468
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,759
We're good.

469
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:11,319
We're good.

470
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:11,799
OK.

471
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,079
We got some work to do.

472
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,200
I've got my eye on you.

473
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,200
Hey, I'm cool, man.

474
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
I think you might have been thinking of the other green guy.

475
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:23,630
I didn't do anything.

476
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,109
OK.

477
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:24,750
I'm doing my task.

478
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,869
I haven't run into you once.

479
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:28,589
I want to watch you do a task.

480
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:30,009
OK.

481
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:30,410
Come with me.

482
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,930
Let me see where we got tasks.

483
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,970
I'm going to follow right behind you.

484
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,930
And I want you to do a task.

485
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,250
All right.

486
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,890
Right over this way.

487
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,390
Come with me.

488
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,539
I know it's you.

489
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,220
And I'm going to convince everybody eventually.

490
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,819
And eventually, they're going to get on my side.

491
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,660
And I'm going to convince everybody eventually.

492
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,180
But I'm staying far enough away from you.

493
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,140
I am the imposter.

494
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,940
And I'm going to kill you.

495
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,220
And I'm going to kill everybody you know.

496
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:53,740
Tell them.

497
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,619
See if they believe you.

498
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:55,660
Can I?

499
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,460
Emergency meeting.

500
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:57,900
Wait, there isn't.

501
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,339
I'm telling you.

502
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:00,059
It's these two.

503
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:01,900
I'm telling you.

504
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,420
This is like fucking crazy.

505
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,500
Oh, why am I the crazy guy in the fucking horror movie

506
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,299
that nobody believes?

507
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:15,339
Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.

508
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:16,380
Listen, Vinny.

509
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,579
They thought it's a.

510
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,079
Oh, my.

511
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:38,779
It's wrong.

512
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,059
They're just being weirdos.

513
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,960
God damn it, man.

514
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,349
You got to be kidding me.

515
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,190
Why would they chase me around?

516
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,549
It's because I'm a new player.

517
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:00,589
And oh, no.

518
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,190
But it has to be one of them, right?

519
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,309
They're going to vote Charlie out.

520
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:11,150
Because I got my like weird fucking like maniacal talk.

521
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,690
Hi.

522
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,389
I had it wrong.

523
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,269
I had a dead wrong.

524
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,090
I'm very curious what happens here.

525
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,750
Why it's not you.

526
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,250
Yes.

527
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:44,010
How's my volume?

528
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,750
Should I turn it down?

529
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,230
Turn turn.

530
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,670
Should I turn me down and them up?

531
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,409
Yeah.

532
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:58,989
Am I good?

533
00:34:58,989 --> 00:34:59,949
OK, just turn them up.

534
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:05,309
So who are they voting for?

535
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,380
Oh, they're going to actually get it.

536
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:12,159
No.

537
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,179
Oh, that's bad.

538
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,380
That's bad for you, buddy.

539
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,219
You got two strikes on you right now.

540
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:18,719
Guys, I'm chill.

541
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,659
German said you.

542
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,539
And Vinny vote you.

543
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:21,039
OK.

544
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:21,739
Yeah, German dies.

545
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:22,239
No.

546
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,260
I hope we can't shut things.

547
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,300
He's pretty good, so fuck off.

548
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,800
What?

549
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,300
German dies.

550
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:29,739
I can't play these games, man.

551
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:30,940
I get too fucked up.

552
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,559
Especially in VR.

553
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,599
I get to untangle myself.

554
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,679
That's so funny, though.

555
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,559
Yeah, OK.

556
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,480
So Charborg was following me around,

557
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,010
making like goblin sounds.

558
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,050
Like, oh, I'm going to get you.

559
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,130
And like chasing behind me and stuff.

560
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:47,769
And I'm like, what the fuck?

561
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,760
It's definitely him.

562
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,630
But isn't that your job?

563
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,750
Well, I'm not, I'm not.

564
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,190
Resident Sus guy?

565
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,869
Yeah, well, I have to get the imposter first.

566
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,760
I can't, I can't just play, you know.

567
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,880
I can't just play the part.

568
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,320
I have to be the part.

569
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,039
It's kind of unfair.

570
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,409
You're a better actor than I am.

571
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:10,010
You've successfully portrayed yourself

572
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,530
as a normal human being for years,

573
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,210
which is a real skill.

574
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,570
I wish I was half that good.

575
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,550
I love how you're just like the resident ghost.

576
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,190
How did you die?

577
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,360
I said hello to Vinny.

578
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,860
Oh.

579
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:28,590
I actually is right away from everyone

580
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,349
because when everybody's talking,

581
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,070
I feel like we should have some sort of conch

582
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,469
or something that we can pass around to everyone.

583
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:37,630
So, you know, everybody gets their two seconds

584
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,150
to say something and everybody's just

585
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,269
screaming over one another.

586
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,389
I guess that's what lobbies just turn into.

587
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:46,590
Oh, we have to do tasks.

588
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:50,940
So what does this do?

589
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:52,380
Oh, you can't move.

590
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,860
Yeah, I think I have to click on the window.

591
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:58,829
Oh, yeah.

592
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,030
All right.

593
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,590
So what happened?

594
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:15,059
Yeah, it's really weird.

595
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,329
So who got you?

596
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,449
He got me, too.

597
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:27,650
Dangerous as hell.

598
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:29,090
That's so funny.

599
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,530
So when you were being chased,

600
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,289
was it Charbon or was it Vinny?

601
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:32,849
No, it was you.

602
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:33,250
Yeah, it was you.

603
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:37,969
Yeah, I was just chasing him and screaming at him and stuff.

604
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,050
He was like, yeah, you and Phil Boat.

605
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,329
You're like, yeah, we're the imposters.

606
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:43,650
We're coming.

607
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,369
We're going to get you.

608
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:47,489
And they were hanging out together.

609
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:50,050
So and they did this weird triangle pattern behind me.

610
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,369
And I was like, it was scary.

611
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:52,849
I don't know what to say.

612
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:56,050
I mean, I was acting on instincts.

613
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:58,289
I let instincts take over and that's what happened.

614
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:01,570
I just panicked.

615
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,210
I don't know.

616
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,809
I mean, it was it was it was funny.

617
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,440
What you in for, man?

618
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,159
Oh, this is funny.

619
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,039
OK, I get why people play this.

620
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,739
I understand why people download this game now.

621
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:30,019
What's this?

622
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:32,260
They're going to get them.

623
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:39,150
Nobody voted.

624
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:47,469
Wow, two still remain.

625
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:49,070
Who's the other one?

626
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,300
All right, let me do some tasks here.

627
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,280
Let me actually do like what I'm supposed to be doing.

628
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,199
Well, now I'm just going to do tasks.

629
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:11,489
I feel like, OK, I feel like whoever the imposter is

630
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,380
wants to get rid of like the loud guy, right?

631
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,900
Like just like let's get rid of that guy

632
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,739
because he's going to like fucking freak out

633
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:19,099
and start screaming at people, right?

634
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:19,820
You get rid of that guy.

635
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,099
He's the annoying guy in the lobby, me.

636
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,269
All right.

637
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:26,349
How do I do this objective?

638
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:28,110
OK, so I got to learn how to do these.

639
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,940
So what are we going to do?

640
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,539
One, two, three, four.

641
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,860
Oh, so it was.

642
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:41,250
I knew it too.

643
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,090
No one believed.

644
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,809
No one believed.

645
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:45,090
He didn't say anything.

646
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,250
Why was it so stressful?

647
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,250
Oh, my God.

648
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,369
It wasn't even green or yellow without talking.

649
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,300
I need a drink with my drink.

650
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,900
You guys ready to play some among us?

651
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,400
I'm ready.

652
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,739
How many how many subs gaming?

653
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:03,460
Well, I guess we'll never know.

654
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,179
I guess it was.

655
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,300
That was amazing.

656
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,619
I'm going to stop talking from now on because he just won.

657
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,820
Hold on.

658
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,460
Here we go.

659
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,820
Yeah, it works, honestly.

660
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,619
I know it.

661
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,619
It's amazing how well you can defend yourself

662
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:17,659
with not saying anything.

663
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:23,500
He really said, and I just was like, all right, fair.

664
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,619
And also this as well.

665
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:26,860
Well, there's two hands for that one.

666
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,340
Yeah, just put them in the other hand.

667
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,300
It's what it's in your ass.

668
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,179
Wait, turn on.

669
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:35,739
OK, I've got at least five.

670
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:36,539
I was hanging low.

671
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:37,420
I got at least five.

672
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:39,739
I can hear you, Jolly.

673
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,039
I'm sure we're good.

674
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,079
That's actually the amount.

675
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:48,829
Remember, one day only, the sus guy plays among us.

676
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:53,840
The omega sub call out of five.

677
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,079
Then might as well play some among us.

678
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm ready.

679
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,199
I don't think you're in the right lobby.

680
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,079
Oh, I didn't even take a sip.

681
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:00,719
I didn't take a sip.

682
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,760
Can I get my friend back in?

683
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,320
Well, he know about it.

684
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,719
Oh, yeah.

685
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,199
OK.

686
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,320
I don't want to run into anything.

687
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,960
I appreciate it.

688
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,840
Do we need to just get kicked out by someone?

689
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,480
Wait, Vinnie got kicked out?

690
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,119
No, it's the random guy.

691
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:09,440
OK.

692
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,320
Well, it's just the random guy.

693
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,280
It's just the random guy?

694
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,840
OK.

695
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,880
I think someone shares a lot of stories.

696
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,159
You want to lightly ask him to leave?

697
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,400
That's incredible.

698
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,199
I may have done that.

699
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,400
No, that dude came in and said, all right,

700
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,760
who's ready to play some among us?

701
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
And I was like, oh, this guy's OK.

702
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,239
I don't know.

703
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,280
It's possible that it was me.

704
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,239
I didn't doubt it.

705
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,280
Yeah, I didn't doubt it at all.

706
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,559
That's why I'm bad at among us.

707
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,840
Oh, and I could turn my mic down.

708
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,280
You know, they're among us.

709
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,599
OK.

710
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,639
I don't even know.

711
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,360
All right, so are we ready to rock and roll before the lobby

712
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:33,840
gets full?

713
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,119
Because I think there was a leak at some point,

714
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,039
so the code is out there at some point.

715
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,360
Oh, are we redoing it?

716
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,159
You can hear me.

717
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:42,639
Oh, OK.

718
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,440
So roll it in.

719
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:43,920
All right.

720
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,280
Roll it in.

721
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,760
OK.

722
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
All right.

723
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,280
Can you see the code on the big board?

724
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,159
Can you hear me?

725
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:50,639
No, no.

726
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:50,880
Yes.

727
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,559
We can hear you loud and clear.

728
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:53,360
OK.

729
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,000
Oh, my god.

730
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,119
That was amazing.

731
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,360
You defended yourself so well with the gestures.

732
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,960
Thank you.

733
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,159
I did it somehow.

734
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,239
Listen.

735
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,840
Vinny, I'm never trusting you ever again.

736
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,639
I was hiding from two people.

737
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,239
I know.

738
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:12,639
I know.

739
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:15,280
Dude, I saw Vinny alone in the cabin's quarters,

740
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,039
and he just slowly walked towards me,

741
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,719
and I was screaming, and no one was around.

742
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,199
It's so scary.

743
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,079
All right.

744
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:24,639
Ready to go?

745
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,519
Oh, my god.

746
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:26,239
I'm ready now.

747
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:26,800
I'm ready.

748
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,239
I don't know how to change my hair.

749
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:28,719
That's OK.

750
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,119
I'm fine.

751
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:29,519
Let's do it.

752
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:29,920
That's fine.

753
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,239
That's fine.

754
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:30,719
We roll.

755
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,119
We move.

756
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:31,599
We roll.

757
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,079
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

758
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,119
I can't be doing with this.

759
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,840
It's too hot.

760
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,400
Too hot.

761
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,280
How are you doing?

762
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,690
OK.

763
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,329
No way.

764
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:41,969
Oh.

765
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:42,530
What are we?

766
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,010
No way.

767
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,489
Oh.

768
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:43,969
Oh.

769
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:44,449
Oh.

770
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:44,929
Oh.

771
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,889
Oh, boy.

772
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:46,849
Oh.

773
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:48,210
Oh, dear.

774
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:48,929
All right.

775
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:49,409
OK.

776
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:50,289
Are there any tasks?

777
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:51,809
I'm going to do my tasks.

778
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:52,929
Two hands.

779
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:53,650
Me too.

780
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:53,969
OK.

781
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:55,409
Somebody has to take care of that.

782
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,130
They know how to play.

783
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:56,690
They know how to play.

784
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,050
Just I'm staying with somebody.

785
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,250
I can stay with 10 people.

786
00:42:59,250 --> 00:42:59,889
I'm going off.

787
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:00,369
I'm going off.

788
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,650
I'm going to stay.

789
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,769
It's so dark in here.

790
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:03,409
Is that what they call it?

791
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:03,889
I'm going to stay.

792
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:04,530
Stay together.

793
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,570
Stay together.

794
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,210
They called the lights.

795
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,849
They called the lights.

796
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:08,530
They called the lights.

797
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,570
You need this fail boat.

798
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,690
You run really fast.

799
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,329
Stay together.

800
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:11,489
Stay.

801
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,449
Why are we running so fast?

802
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:13,010
Stay together.

803
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,730
There's three of us here.

804
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,210
One, two.

805
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,090
OK.

806
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:15,889
Slow movement.

807
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:16,369
Slow.

808
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:16,690
Slow.

809
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,090
I'm going.

810
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:17,329
Wait.

811
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:17,650
Where am I?

812
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,050
Just tap.

813
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,449
Tap.

814
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:19,389
Tap.

815
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:20,590
Oh.

816
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,630
That was so ominous.

817
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:25,309
OK.

818
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:25,710
Hey, guys.

819
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,030
We're good.

820
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:26,349
We're good.

821
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:27,309
Now, let's come back on.

822
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:28,030
I just see green.

823
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:29,389
Hello.

824
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:30,190
You get in.

825
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,469
I'm going to go in this corner.

826
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:32,909
And I'm going to watch.

827
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:33,789
Press some buttons.

828
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:34,349
So I've got.

829
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:35,070
Yes.

830
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,909
It's good to watch your back.

831
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:38,349
When you have nothing against your back.

832
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:39,389
That's right.

833
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,309
That's the strategy.

834
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:42,909
So we're going to get these tasks done, please.

835
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,750
Yeah.

836
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,030
I got mine done.

837
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:46,909
I'm doing them.

838
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:49,739
I'll watch the doorway, guys.

839
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:51,019
No one's getting by me.

840
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:51,739
Well, that one's not done.

841
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,980
That might be your task.

842
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,460
Is it mine?

843
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,909
How does this work?

844
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,690
Where am I?

845
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:05,739
Hello?

846
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:08,059
Hello?

847
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:13,300
Hello?

848
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,510
Can anybody hear me?

849
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:18,539
What happened?

850
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:21,780
Where am I?

851
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,159
I think I got like sucked into the wall.

852
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:26,559
Hold on.

853
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:27,519
Can I?

854
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:35,170
What is going on?

855
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,289
Fix the sabotage.

856
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:40,610
OK.

857
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:41,650
Um.

858
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,949
You shouldn't have asked me to do that.

859
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:55,150
Why did you ask me?

860
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,909
You're just leading me around the entire map.

861
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:57,710
How did you do that?

862
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,510
How did you do that?

863
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,070
Again?

864
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,869
I don't know.

865
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:00,829
I tried to do.

866
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,230
What happened to you?

867
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,349
I don't want to be the imposter anymore.

868
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:07,550
I went into the wall.

869
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,349
I went into the wall.

870
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:09,150
It was scary.

871
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,630
You just walked through Hogwarts.

872
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,429
I went in.

873
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:13,230
I went in.

874
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,190
I was so happy that at the same time, I just don't want to be the imposter.

875
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:16,829
What, we're going again?

876
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:20,030
Not the imposter again.

877
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,070
It's the imposter again.

878
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:21,630
Thanks, bro.

879
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,429
Oh, OK.

880
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,469
We're fine.

881
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:23,789
We're fine.

882
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:26,510
There needs to be individual volume sliders.

883
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:26,989
OK.

884
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:28,030
Yeah, I pushed the torque block.

885
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:28,670
Am I sure?

886
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,710
I have no idea what happened.

887
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,269
Um.

888
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,590
No, it's just the cacophony of noise.

889
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,670
So if someone sabotages the generator and you don't turn it off in time, then you just

890
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,030
wait for the video to play straight up.

891
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,630
I have absolutely no idea what that means.

892
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:40,269
Imposter?

893
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:40,829
Get away from me.

894
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:42,429
The generator, I was about to fix it.

895
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:44,030
And then it didn't work.

896
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,670
What the?

897
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:45,630
What is happening?

898
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,590
Why don't press it?

899
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,510
It's not me.

900
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,869
It's not me this time.

901
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:51,070
It's not me this time.

902
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,429
I say, Rambo, just to be safe.

903
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:53,150
What happened?

904
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,670
No, it's not me.

905
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,789
I swear, four times in a row is statistically impossible.

906
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,190
Four times in a row is statistically impossible.

907
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:00,670
OK?

908
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,309
Look, here we are.

909
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:01,869
It's impossible.

910
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:02,429
Here we are.

911
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,150
It might be impossible.

912
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:03,949
It might be impossible.

913
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:04,510
It might be impossible.

914
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:04,909
It is.

915
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,469
But how funny would it be if you're voted out and it says,

916
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:08,590
what imposter remains?

917
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,590
I swear to you, it's funny this time.

918
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:14,670
Four times in a row is statistically impossible.

919
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,389
We need to stop goofing around.

920
00:46:17,389 --> 00:46:17,869
OK?

921
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:19,869
No more goofing around.

922
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:20,829
Stop goofing around.

923
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:21,150
I agree.

924
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:21,710
It's not me.

925
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,110
I agree.

926
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:22,590
OK?

927
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,710
There's no goofing going on here.

928
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:24,909
There's been so much goofing around.

929
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:26,269
Why do you do this brave speech from the corner of the room?

930
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:28,510
Because people were goofing around too much.

931
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:28,989
Please.

932
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,309
There's too much goofing around.

933
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:33,309
The people, we have to be careful.

934
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:34,190
We have to talk to each other.

935
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,389
We have to fucking follow each other.

936
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:35,789
Skip the vote.

937
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:36,510
OK, we're good.

938
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:36,989
All right.

939
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:38,429
If you do it your way, gas can.

940
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:39,070
It's not me.

941
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:39,710
How would you?

942
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,190
I swear to God, it's not me again.

943
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,070
I think that hitting the emergency,

944
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,269
it's an emergency meeting.

945
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:46,909
You know what I mean?

946
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:48,590
It's only for emergencies only.

947
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:53,380
You're getting close.

948
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,420
If it's you again, I'm going to be very mad.

949
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,139
I'm just telling you.

950
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,320
I'm going to do my job.

951
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,920
Hey, Zamzire.

952
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,639
Are we skipping?

953
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,559
Go ahead and make your vote already so we can get the freaking back to work.

954
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:13,360
I'm skipping.

955
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,000
What are you doing?

956
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,559
What are you doing?

957
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:14,880
What?

958
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,639
Where's your sense of bloodlust?

959
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,079
I thought my trust in you was waning.

960
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,840
I only have one finger.

961
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,199
Do an ET on me, bro.

962
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,519
I don't think that's all I got.

963
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:25,119
Nobody was ejected.

964
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,079
OK, we're fine.

965
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:26,719
OK.

966
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,840
OK.

967
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,239
Now I'm going to make a real task.

968
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:31,440
Task time.

969
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,000
How do you do it?

970
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:34,639
How do I do tasks again?

971
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,440
Jerma, press the button just to get the map and go to those locations and then just click in.

972
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,119
I don't fucking understand what that means.

973
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,159
OK.

974
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,360
So what do you have?

975
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:43,760
An index?

976
00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:46,829
Kill him, kill him.

977
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:47,389
I can't do it.

978
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:47,949
I don't know how to do it.

979
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:48,349
Kill him.

980
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:48,750
Do it.

981
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,309
I don't know how to do it.

982
00:47:49,309 --> 00:47:49,869
Kill him.

983
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:50,429
How do you do it?

984
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:51,389
Do it.

985
00:47:51,389 --> 00:47:51,710
Kill him.

986
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,190
I don't know how to do it.

987
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,710
30 seconds before you can kill.

988
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,030
What?

989
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:54,590
There's a creep on.

990
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:55,070
What do you put?

991
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:55,789
There's a creep on.

992
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,269
There's a creep on.

993
00:47:56,269 --> 00:47:56,590
There's a creep on.

994
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,550
There's a creep on.

995
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:57,949
What?

996
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:58,349
What?

997
00:47:58,349 --> 00:47:58,429
What?

998
00:47:58,429 --> 00:47:58,750
What?

999
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,230
Oh, man.

1000
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:11,869
I'm going to tell you something and you have to believe me.

1001
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:16,050
Well, don't believe a fucking word out of his mouth.

1002
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:21,570
This guy has killed me twice each time he chased me around the cafeteria.

1003
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,650
He chased me around the cafeteria.

1004
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:28,769
We were screaming in here.

1005
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:29,489
Did anybody hear me?

1006
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,119
No.

1007
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:31,199
No.

1008
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,079
This sounds like a lie.

1009
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,559
The last thing I knew when the meeting was called was there's a cool down.

1010
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,679
I'm just saying.

1011
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:40,400
I'm saying you can believe me or not, but it's Jerma.

1012
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:40,960
Thank you very much.

1013
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,440
I'm here to do tasks and we're just spending all this time in meetings.

1014
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,159
What are we arguing about?

1015
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:44,719
What's going on?

1016
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:45,760
I lost your mind.

1017
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,159
I don't know.

1018
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,559
I've been chased around by him for literally an entire day.

1019
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,119
I don't know what the thank you was.

1020
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,920
Yeah, last time you got chased around, it was also a freakish juice call.

1021
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,159
Okay?

1022
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:56,159
I see no one dead yet.

1023
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:57,280
I'm just telling you.

1024
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,400
The roommate who called sucks.

1025
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,639
I'm not going to tell you why I think Jerma did it.

1026
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:01,440
Or is it?

1027
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,880
I'm not going to say the reason why.

1028
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,840
You're too cool right now.

1029
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,320
Why?

1030
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:04,960
He's too calculated.

1031
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,239
That seems like a thing you should say.

1032
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:07,519
He's literally calculated.

1033
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:09,840
He's cool and he's calculated and he's trying to fucking get rid of me.

1034
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,400
Counterintuitive.

1035
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,800
Go see later on if I guess.

1036
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,840
I mean, believe me if you want.

1037
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,880
Dude, skip the phone.

1038
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,840
Like, what's the point?

1039
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,760
I like how people say things sometimes.

1040
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,639
Skip.

1041
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:19,760
I'm going back to work, right?

1042
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,039
I don't care.

1043
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:22,320
Yeah, let me do my tasks.

1044
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,719
Somebody.

1045
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,079
I've never interrupted my nine to five.

1046
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,000
The spin guy's going to be right at the end of the day.

1047
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,519
The guy who says spin.

1048
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:28,559
Somebody follow him.

1049
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,159
I'm afraid to be near him.

1050
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:30,800
Somebody follow him.

1051
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,199
Why don't you follow him?

1052
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,559
Because he's literally was chasing me around the cafeteria.

1053
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,409
Are we all good?

1054
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:42,769
Wait, no.

1055
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:43,329
We're good to go.

1056
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:44,210
It's not like Dundall.

1057
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:48,849
Good luck, everybody.

1058
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:50,530
Just don't spend too much time with Jerma.

1059
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,530
All right, we're good.

1060
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:52,929
All right.

1061
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:53,730
That's bullshit.

1062
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,489
Absolute bullshit.

1063
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:56,449
Please don't listen to that.

1064
00:49:57,409 --> 00:49:58,369
You're too close, too.

1065
00:49:58,369 --> 00:49:59,250
I'm going to go this way.

1066
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,210
I'm just going to go this way.

1067
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,369
I'm just going to go.

1068
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:03,969
Yeah, I'll stay with you.

1069
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:05,969
Stay.

1070
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:06,769
What?

1071
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:07,969
What do you mean, stay?

1072
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:08,530
Stay?

1073
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,289
I don't want to be in a room with two people.

1074
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:11,650
I have tasks to do.

1075
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,369
Oh my god.

1076
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:13,010
This isn't me.

1077
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,650
This isn't me.

1078
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,690
This isn't me.

1079
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:15,570
I can't see.

1080
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:16,050
It's not me.

1081
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,010
Oh my god.

1082
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:17,820
Get back here.

1083
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,300
It's not me.

1084
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,179
No, no, no, no.

1085
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:20,940
I'm just looking to see who's around the corner.

1086
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,030
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

1087
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,349
I don't like you being behind me.

1088
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:27,869
I'm in a defensive position right now.

1089
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:30,110
We'll all stay six feet apart.

1090
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:30,590
It's OK.

1091
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,030
Six feet apart.

1092
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,630
We can walk down here.

1093
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,590
I have to go to.

1094
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,389
OK, I'm going to slow it.

1095
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:35,949
You're going to walk.

1096
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:36,989
Yeah, I have to go here, too.

1097
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:40,099
I have to go this way.

1098
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:40,980
Don't get behind me.

1099
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,190
I have to.

1100
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,510
I'm just in front of you.

1101
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,190
I just have to pull this thing.

1102
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,300
Where is the?

1103
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,019
How do I get over here?

1104
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:03,250
OK, I got to go this way.

1105
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:03,969
Straight ahead, I think.

1106
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,349
I don't like being alone.

1107
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:07,389
I don't like being alone.

1108
00:51:07,389 --> 00:51:08,269
I don't like being alone.

1109
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:09,070
I don't like being alone.

1110
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,099
Get him away from me.

1111
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:12,739
Get him away from me.

1112
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:13,460
Get him away from me.

1113
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,019
Get him away from me.

1114
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,460
Get him away from me.

1115
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:21,380
Don't go alone.

1116
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,179
He's going alone.

1117
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:22,900
He's going alone.

1118
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,860
Oh, yeah.

1119
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,739
Oh, yeah.

1120
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:26,780
OK, let's let's squat up then.

1121
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,179
Let's go.

1122
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:27,900
Let's go find him.

1123
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,739
I don't like doing this.

1124
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:30,460
Find him.

1125
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,840
Let's go find him.

1126
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,480
Do you trust me?

1127
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,360
Pinky promise.

1128
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,159
I trust you.

1129
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:35,199
Pinky promise.

1130
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:35,699
Oh, God.

1131
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:36,980
Pinky, pinky promise.

1132
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,219
What the fuck happened?

1133
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,059
How do I report that?

1134
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:46,980
How do I report this?

1135
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,739
How do I report it?

1136
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,780
Oh, wow.

1137
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,420
What is that?

1138
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,139
How do I report it?

1139
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:51,860
Who did you see?

1140
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,500
Who did you see?

1141
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:52,980
Who was there?

1142
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,619
I saw Jerma.

1143
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:54,340
I saw Jerma.

1144
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,840
What?

1145
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,719
This guy killed someone.

1146
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:58,679
He was eating a body.

1147
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:00,199
We came in the room and he was eating a body.

1148
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:00,760
That's it.

1149
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,320
OK.

1150
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:01,719
All right.

1151
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:02,119
Fine.

1152
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:02,519
What?

1153
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,480
Eating it.

1154
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,639
Look, all I know, it was dark.

1155
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:06,519
I was with Charborg.

1156
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:07,559
We were walking in the room.

1157
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,199
I saw Jerma.

1158
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:09,559
He went, oh.

1159
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,159
And then Charborg said, there's a body.

1160
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:11,800
There's a body.

1161
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,079
And so that's interesting.

1162
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:14,199
It was a yellow body.

1163
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:14,599
Interesting.

1164
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,440
Do you have anything to say to defend yourself?

1165
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,400
You two were together.

1166
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:17,960
That's funny.

1167
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,239
You two were walking around together.

1168
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:19,800
Whoa, yeah.

1169
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,320
That's funny.

1170
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,239
We're just trying to get.

1171
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:24,599
There are two imposters that are made.

1172
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,360
Yeah, you've been following me around this whole time

1173
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,800
doing tests with me.

1174
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,280
Yeah.

1175
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,079
That's weird.

1176
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,519
So this guy.

1177
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,480
That is kind of weird.

1178
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,920
I can't confirm they were.

1179
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,800
Is that correct, Jerma?

1180
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,679
Just give the vote?

1181
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,559
I'm voting for you, actually, is what I'm doing.

1182
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:38,039
Oh, yeah?

1183
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:38,679
Well, guess what?

1184
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:39,400
I'm going to skip.

1185
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,480
I think Jerma is suspicious.

1186
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,360
I am voting for him.

1187
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,880
How do you like that?

1188
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,159
I believe you.

1189
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,570
What are you going to have?

1190
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,210
What do you think?

1191
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:48,690
You think I'm.

1192
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,409
What do you say?

1193
00:52:49,409 --> 00:52:50,210
Go ahead, say it.

1194
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,090
What do you think I am?

1195
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,929
I think you're an imposter.

1196
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:53,250
OK.

1197
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,619
I mean, whatever.

1198
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:56,099
I'm voting.

1199
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:58,260
Saying OK is a good defense.

1200
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,219
All I'm saying is that I was chased around the cafeteria

1201
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,900
in the first five seconds of the game.

1202
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:04,980
People have been fucking with me the whole.

1203
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:14,019
I didn't know there was a cool down to start the fucking game.

1204
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,579
I didn't know there was a cool down.

1205
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:18,179
There was a cool down.

1206
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:19,380
There's a cool down.

1207
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,619
There's a goddamn cool down.

1208
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,219
Face your sins.

1209
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,820
I just hanging with the two imposters

1210
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,340
at the bottom of the map over there.

1211
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:30,840
Incredible.

1212
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,079
I was hanging with it.

1213
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,119
I was hanging with them too.

1214
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:34,840
They stuck together.

1215
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,679
I didn't know there was a cool down in the very.

1216
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:37,800
We were chasing Vinnie around.

1217
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,679
And I'm like trying to kill him.

1218
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:39,880
And I'm like, why can't I kill this guy?

1219
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,320
And then it's like, oh, there's a cool down.

1220
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:41,800
I can't do it.

1221
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,760
Yeah, it's like 35 seconds or something right there.

1222
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,800
Oh, I did.

1223
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,159
I should have done the tutorial.

1224
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,300
You told him to stay.

1225
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,059
You told me to stay in the medical office.

1226
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:56,099
I didn't have anything.

1227
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,699
I don't know why.

1228
00:53:57,699 --> 00:53:59,460
Sit right here.

1229
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,300
I don't know why I trusted that.

1230
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,079
It's a trusting voice.

1231
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:06,760
So how far is voice proximity?

1232
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,920
Because I was like, holy shit, there's no way anybody knows.

1233
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,559
Wait, wait, hold on.

1234
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:10,039
I'm testing.

1235
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:11,000
Ah.

1236
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,139
Oh, that's far.

1237
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:14,619
That is?

1238
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:16,059
OK, but if you're behind a door.

1239
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:16,619
That's pretty far.

1240
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:17,900
Because we were running around in a circle here.

1241
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,820
If I go in here, if I go in here, then.

1242
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,059
It's like, we're going to glide away.

1243
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,260
Then you can't hear me.

1244
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:23,820
No, no, no.

1245
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,539
I can hear him in there.

1246
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:25,420
I can hear him in there.

1247
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,300
Wait, what is?

1248
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,579
Well, it's because the door's open.

1249
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:29,420
Rambo, is that you?

1250
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:31,530
Yeah.

1251
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:31,849
What?

1252
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:33,210
I didn't know you were in this lobby.

1253
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:33,690
Oh, yeah.

1254
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:35,610
My username is homealone.

1255
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,130
My username is homealone2.

1256
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:37,610
Holy shit.

1257
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,090
How are you?

1258
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:39,690
I forget to change it on Steam.

1259
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,730
I'm doing good.

1260
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:41,449
I'm doing good.

1261
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:41,929
How are you?

1262
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:43,530
That's cool.

1263
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,489
I mean, you killed me.

1264
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,449
So not too good.

1265
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,570
But it's fine.

1266
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:46,889
Yeah.

1267
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,170
It's like the other side of the station.

1268
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,489
I'm just glad it wasn't done on purpose now.

1269
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:50,969
Now I know.

1270
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,010
I can't believe you won with a sabotage kill.

1271
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:56,489
That's so cool.

1272
00:54:56,489 --> 00:54:57,210
You don't know how.

1273
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,969
I mean, I think it's about to happen again.

1274
00:54:58,969 --> 00:54:59,690
I'm going to be real.

1275
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,690
I think it's about to happen again.

1276
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,690
Dude, I'm going to die.

1277
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,659
I'm going to die.

1278
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:07,659
Dude, I'm going to be kidding you.

1279
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:09,019
I'm going to be kidding you.

1280
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:09,900
But it's not fair.

1281
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,380
Oh my god.

1282
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,380
What a lame way to lose again.

1283
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,099
I'm just saying.

1284
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:13,900
Who did that?

1285
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,940
I didn't know there was a cooldown.

1286
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,260
I didn't get there.

1287
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,139
We'll fix the other one, man.

1288
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:16,860
That's so funny.

1289
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,260
That was a 45-second cooldown.

1290
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,539
That was a step in the ass.

1291
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:22,860
It was like 45 seconds, maybe.

1292
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,860
You actually, that was a good cover, though.

1293
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,699
You actually, you following, you run it.

1294
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,219
Yeah, that was a great cover on your part.

1295
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:30,539
Who laughed when I booted?

1296
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:31,659
What are your hands doing?

1297
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:32,539
Oh, it's Kony also.

1298
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:33,099
Oh my god.

1299
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:34,539
Look at his hands.

1300
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,500
Kony Island.

1301
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,860
What's going on with my hands?

1302
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,340
Kony Island.

1303
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:37,820
I don't know.

1304
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,780
I'm so sorry.

1305
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,260
I'm OK.

1306
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,139
It's 300.

1307
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:40,619
It's fine.

1308
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:41,099
It's OK.

1309
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,820
What happens if I throw my index controller here?

1310
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,619
What happens?

1311
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:45,739
Is it just a floating hand on there?

1312
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:46,619
It's on the floor.

1313
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:47,099
Yeah.

1314
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,260
Whoa, what are you doing with my finger?

1315
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,780
It's like clock.

1316
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,860
Can I just walk away from my desk?

1317
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,300
Wow, look at that.

1318
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,780
Hold on.

1319
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,099
Amazing.

1320
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:57,460
Can I just walk away from my hand?

1321
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,019
I wonder.

1322
00:55:58,019 --> 00:55:59,539
Yeah, you can walk away from your hand, I think.

1323
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:00,179
Yeah.

1324
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:01,619
Oh no, it stays with me.

1325
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:02,119
Eww.

1326
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:04,039
Eww.

1327
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:05,079
Hey, hey there, Jolly.

1328
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:06,920
Get that hand on the collar.

1329
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,880
You give me imposter again, and I'm going to be ready this time.

1330
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,360
Woo.

1331
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,000
Hey, man.

1332
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,679
A little bit of a little touch.

1333
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:14,039
And just walk away.

1334
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:14,679
There you go.

1335
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:15,719
Just walk away from it.

1336
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:17,719
But it's a pleasure to meet you for the first time.

1337
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:18,599
Vinny had your back?

1338
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:19,320
Yeah, he did.

1339
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,000
You really know what's going on.

1340
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,840
Vinny, I do appreciate the sympathy skip at the beginning.

1341
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,559
Bad.

1342
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:26,199
I like it.

1343
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:27,320
I like what you've done here.

1344
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:32,039
I had to call you out right away, but I'm glad that you got a chance to at least explain

1345
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:32,440
yourself.

1346
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:32,760
There you go.

1347
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,239
There you go.

1348
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,840
That was one of your comedy goals.

1349
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,679
He just puts his hand on the table and walks away.

1350
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:38,119
I watch your lips.

1351
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:39,960
I'm like, check this out.

1352
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,519
Too funny.

1353
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:41,639
Listen, listen, listen.

1354
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:42,599
I got your back.

1355
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,400
I got your back.

1356
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,039
I appreciate it.

1357
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:45,400
You can't argue that if I had to do that.

1358
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,880
I was chasing around screaming, how do I kill you?

1359
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,360
It's not weird.

1360
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,880
Coney is so funny.

1361
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,440
It would have been just like a killer chasing you.

1362
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:55,559
How do I do it?

1363
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:56,199
How do I kill you?

1364
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:56,440
I don't know.

1365
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,559
Do I strangle?

1366
00:56:57,559 --> 00:56:58,440
Should I hit you with a brick?

1367
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:00,440
What am I even talking about?

1368
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,079
It was amazing.

1369
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:02,440
It was like a Conan O'Brien bit.

1370
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:02,920
I love it.

1371
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,920
He hasn't said anything in the chat.

1372
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,480
Did Coney just fucking die?

1373
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,360
There we go.

1374
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,400
Yeah, I don't see him.

1375
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,280
And he hasn't said anything in the chat, so I'm not sure.

1376
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,880
He's probably trying to figure things out.

1377
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,840
I probably look so stupid from an outside perspective.

1378
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,340
I'm just going to sit.

1379
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:28,380
It's kind of fun to stand and play this, but Coney had connection issues on his stream,

1380
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,179
everybody.

1381
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:29,739
Oh, no.

1382
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:30,219
Oh, no.

1383
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,340
Do you want to do one and hopefully Coney will be back for the next one?

1384
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,780
Yeah, I guess so.

1385
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,380
I didn't notice who else was in the room with Jerma and myself.

1386
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,699
Everyone make sure to stretch.

1387
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:56,239
Time to go to work, everyone.

1388
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:58,639
All right.

1389
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:00,159
I sussed very well there.

1390
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:00,960
How are you doing?

1391
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,599
I hate being here.

1392
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:10,800
I am going to go do my task, which is I have to go over here.

1393
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,880
I was the other imposter and I was trying to tell him that there was a cooldown to kill.

1394
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
There's a 45 second cooldown.

1395
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,159
Can we all just go together?

1396
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,920
No, I mean like everybody and go back to back here.

1397
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,880
He's going to go together.

1398
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,280
That's going to be hard to coordinate, but we'll try.

1399
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,800
Okay, so there's tasks this way.

1400
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,440
Hey, what's going on over here?

1401
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,320
What the fuck are you guys doing over here?

1402
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:52,170
I'm going to do this task over here.

1403
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:57,630
I'm going to try to do smooth.

1404
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,750
Task complete over here, guys.

1405
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,230
It sounds like you're doing a task over there.

1406
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,349
A lot of peeps and boops.

1407
00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:02,989
Very good.

1408
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:03,550
Thinking about it.

1409
00:59:04,429 --> 00:59:05,389
It's really not great.

1410
00:59:05,389 --> 00:59:08,030
Oh, wait, this is the vent.

1411
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:08,909
You can use those, right?

1412
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:10,760
Yes.

1413
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,119
No, I, oh yes.

1414
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,320
What do you mean by yes?

1415
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,239
What did you mean by yes, you can use those?

1416
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:15,800
You know what I mean.

1417
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,809
I feel like you're going to get sucked in there.

1418
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:30,250
Okay, I go to the lights, I go to the lights, I'm a light doer.

1419
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,050
I'm a light doer.

1420
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,090
I'm a light doer.

1421
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,530
I know you are, but what am I?

1422
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,050
I don't know why I just went.

1423
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:35,690
Where did we go?

1424
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:36,010
Oops.

1425
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,019
It's Jolly and Orange.

1426
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:51,900
It's Jolly and Orange.

1427
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,659
I walked in, they fucking murdered him.

1428
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:54,380
Oh my God.

1429
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:54,780
We died.

1430
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:56,940
We weren't there.

1431
00:59:57,659 --> 00:59:58,300
We weren't there.

1432
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,099
Jolly and Orange.

1433
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,980
I watched them rip him apart.

1434
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,179
I saw that, I saw that.

1435
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:05,019
It wasn't, that's Tim Burton at his best.

1436
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:08,059
Vinny, you and I, you and I were pretending to do tasks.

1437
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:10,380
I pretended that you were winking a joke about going through the vent.

1438
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,820
And like, wouldn't it be funny if you got vented, right?

1439
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,099
Right.

1440
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,980
Just let them mark it.

1441
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:18,619
It's Orange.

1442
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:19,420
It's Orange.

1443
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:19,980
What do you mean?

1444
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,460
I'm walking in.

1445
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,659
Criken, Criken, come here.

1446
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,099
Tell me.

1447
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:29,099
Tell me what happened.

1448
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,099
There was a crossroads.

1449
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:32,619
I was talking to Charborg.

1450
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:33,500
I went in, I did a task.

1451
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,139
The lights were out.

1452
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:34,940
I come back out.

1453
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,260
There was a dead body, Charborg's body.

1454
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,619
And both Dark Blue and Orange were standing over it.

1455
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:43,739
Orange starts sprinting towards me until someone else reported it.

1456
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:44,059
Yeah.

1457
01:00:44,059 --> 01:00:44,699
It was Criken.

1458
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:45,980
It was Criken.

1459
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:49,099
It was Criken.

1460
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:49,500
No, no, no.

1461
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,300
It wasn't Criken.

1462
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,900
I think it was Criken.

1463
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,820
That sounded like a horseshit story.

1464
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,179
That sounded like a horseshit story.

1465
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:57,739
That was a horseshit story.

1466
01:00:58,619 --> 01:00:59,900
That was the best story.

1467
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,860
Because it's true.

1468
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,699
I think that was horseshit.

1469
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,539
All right, you got me convinced now.

1470
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,179
I see why everyone follows around screaming now.

1471
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:31,980
I'm going to join them.

1472
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:34,699
All right.

1473
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:35,980
But wait a minute.

1474
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:36,860
What if it is Criken?

1475
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,000
I'm scared of Penny.

1476
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,440
No, no one emergency.

1477
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,159
He went for me.

1478
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:45,760
He went for me.

1479
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,719
Jolly went for me.

1480
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:49,280
He waited till everyone else was out of the room and he went for me.

1481
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:49,920
Oh, my God.

1482
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,960
Why are you lying?

1483
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,960
Even if I was the person trying to kill you, I would have had a cooldown.

1484
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,239
So what would have been the point?

1485
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:57,199
I dodged it.

1486
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:57,920
I dodged it.

1487
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,199
And then I, yep, it's Jolly.

1488
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:00,639
Jolly was waiting at the back of the room.

1489
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:02,800
Criken in his Australian accident.

1490
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,400
And then he just starts power walking towards me.

1491
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,119
I heard screams.

1492
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,199
I heard some screams.

1493
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:14,000
I heard a few screams.

1494
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,489
So we finished voting out the last guy.

1495
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:28,809
All right.

1496
01:02:28,809 --> 01:02:29,849
I was about to leave the room.

1497
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:32,329
Everyone else scattered.

1498
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:33,369
I turned to my left.

1499
01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:34,489
There's pink Jolly.

1500
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:36,090
And he goes, Criken.

1501
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:39,369
And then he starts power walking towards me, swinging his hands left and right

1502
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:40,570
in a kind of intimidating fashion.

1503
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,050
OK.

1504
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:45,130
I run for the emergency button and smack it right before he gets around my neck.

1505
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,769
So what you're saying is he walked at you kind of funnily

1506
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:48,889
and he was kind of a goofy walk.

1507
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:50,409
So that means that it must be him.

1508
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:51,769
Yeah.

1509
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,449
If you've got a goofy walk, you're probably suspicious.

1510
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:54,730
I mean, but I do that every day.

1511
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,230
But I mean, all of us are goofy walking.

1512
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,510
You're making fun of how people walk?

1513
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,469
I do.

1514
01:02:59,469 --> 01:03:01,070
I do goofy walks.

1515
01:03:04,059 --> 01:03:04,780
I'm not convinced.

1516
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,460
I don't think you're making fun of how people walk.

1517
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,139
I'm just saying that his walk had an aggressive.

1518
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:11,820
There was an aggressive energy to his walk.

1519
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,699
I think that you look kind of like Grimace today.

1520
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:15,500
So I think that it's you.

1521
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,099
No, come on.

1522
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:19,500
Please.

1523
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,780
I was right about the last guy.

1524
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,539
Surely I wouldn't be lying about the second guy.

1525
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:23,900
You've got to make the best of what you've got.

1526
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,539
What?

1527
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:25,039
OK.

1528
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,139
Can I just please get my job done?

1529
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:35,340
I'm going to laugh my ass off if it is you.

1530
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,940
If it's really you, I'm going to be I'm going to laugh.

1531
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:37,659
It's going to be funny.

1532
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,059
Hey, if it was me, this is the bigger brain

1533
01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:41,179
that I've ever done in my life.

1534
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,019
Just keep an eye on Jolly.

1535
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:43,579
All right.

1536
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:44,539
Why am I still holding?

1537
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:45,420
Get this away from me.

1538
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:50,460
Oh, god damn it.

1539
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,260
I had a stupid fucking joke in my hands.

1540
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:58,219
What are you doing?

1541
01:03:58,219 --> 01:03:59,099
There's another one.

1542
01:03:59,099 --> 01:03:59,820
Why are there two?

1543
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:00,940
Oh, god.

1544
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:01,659
We're going to die again.

1545
01:04:03,869 --> 01:04:04,989
Oh, my god.

1546
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:05,550
Oh, my god.

1547
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,429
We're OK.

1548
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:07,949
Stand across the whole room and talk to me.

1549
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:10,679
Where?

1550
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:11,159
Stand here?

1551
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:11,800
Yeah.

1552
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,239
We should not be near each other.

1553
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:15,159
We're going to decipher who is doing this shit.

1554
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:17,179
It's not.

1555
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:17,900
It's not me.

1556
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,940
I can tell you that much.

1557
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,699
I feel like I can trust you because you

1558
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:21,659
would have probably killed me already.

1559
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:22,699
Yeah.

1560
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:23,900
I probably would have killed you by now.

1561
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,460
That's very true.

1562
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:24,860
Very true.

1563
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:29,980
He just did it.

1564
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,579
He did it right in front of us.

1565
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:32,219
OK.

1566
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:33,340
It was Jolly.

1567
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,099
I was wrong.

1568
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:35,820
Here's the thing, though.

1569
01:04:37,659 --> 01:04:39,179
That was amazing.

1570
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:40,300
He could have faked his death.

1571
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,099
He could have faked his death.

1572
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:41,820
But it was him.

1573
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,179
He was talking a lot of shit.

1574
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:45,659
I think he faked his death.

1575
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:46,380
I think he's still here.

1576
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:48,059
I'm voting for Kraken.

1577
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:54,360
OK.

1578
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:55,559
It was not.

1579
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:56,679
It definitely wasn't.

1580
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:57,480
It was not Rambo.

1581
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,119
I'm telling you right now.

1582
01:04:58,119 --> 01:04:59,400
We were literally in the same room.

1583
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,039
Yeah, I know.

1584
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:01,480
We could have killed each other easily.

1585
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,039
I think we're good.

1586
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,420
I think I think it is you.

1587
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:05,739
Yeah.

1588
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:06,940
No, it is simply.

1589
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,260
Kraken was telling the truth to me.

1590
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,739
It's a bout of confidence that it's not me.

1591
01:05:11,739 --> 01:05:12,059
Jolly.

1592
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:12,699
It's Jolly.

1593
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,400
Jolly.

1594
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:15,760
It's not looking good.

1595
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:20,639
That was funny, though.

1596
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,039
It was good.

1597
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:23,119
I'll think.

1598
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,800
Oh, we're good.

1599
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,280
We're good.

1600
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:25,920
We're good.

1601
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,559
We're good.

1602
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:27,119
Let's go.

1603
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,000
Good work, everyone.

1604
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,400
Hey, the thing is, you have to remember, right?

1605
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,760
I was just jamming.

1606
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,639
A lot of people like, hey, what was that whole shit with Kraken?

1607
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,360
You shouldn't have done that.

1608
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,239
I got you to give a real account.

1609
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:39,280
You know what I mean?

1610
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,000
Oh, my God.

1611
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,480
Wow, you're right.

1612
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,239
That's so brave of you to ask me what happened.

1613
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:42,639
That was a.

1614
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:47,280
But when I questioned you, that was a real passionate, real reaction.

1615
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,320
That was a real reaction.

1616
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,280
You know my baseline.

1617
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,880
You know the baseline of what I'm lying.

1618
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,440
Exactly.

1619
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,320
Failboats saw it.

1620
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:58,480
I ran and screamed because I was like, one of us has got to survive.

1621
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,039
But instead of it was you that killed him.

1622
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,880
But I was the one that took the bullet.

1623
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,719
You could have blamed Kraken.

1624
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:06,559
You guys both could have been like, Kraken, you did it.

1625
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:07,679
You totally could have blamed Kraken.

1626
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:08,719
But it was so clear.

1627
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,480
Like, to be fair, yeah, we were both walking together.

1628
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,440
You can always tell when somebody's kind of telling the truth.

1629
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,679
People have perfected this maybe in this game.

1630
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:18,320
I don't know.

1631
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,239
But they're like, what?

1632
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:21,760
They're like, what are you talking?

1633
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,760
It's like a real passionate reaction.

1634
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,719
You know what I mean?

1635
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:25,599
I think you did it.

1636
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:26,800
Excuse me?

1637
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,010
That's how you can tell.

1638
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:29,530
It was just that.

1639
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,690
I was just a witness to murder that no one believed.

1640
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,570
That's literally all that.

1641
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:33,769
Don't worry, Jolly.

1642
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:35,369
I'm not going to hold you against you.

1643
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:36,250
That was fun.

1644
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,130
I was dead, yeah.

1645
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,090
I was.

1646
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:39,849
A good detective covers every base.

1647
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:41,130
I don't think I've done it in any other situation.

1648
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,170
Did Coney jump back in?

1649
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:43,210
Two other people will jump in.

1650
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:43,690
No.

1651
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:44,650
Yes.

1652
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:45,369
What?

1653
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:46,809
I think I agree.

1654
01:06:46,809 --> 01:06:47,050
Yeah.

1655
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:47,849
Get this guy out of here.

1656
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:48,650
Is this one of yours?

1657
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:49,690
Get this guy out of here.

1658
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:50,570
Get this guy out of here.

1659
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:52,170
This is the best way to, uh.

1660
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:55,130
How do we get this guy out of here?

1661
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:56,170
How did he get the code?

1662
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:56,570
I don't know.

1663
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,289
He's dead now.

1664
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,809
Yo, he joined so we could see his name, and then he left.

1665
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,769
Yeah, what do you think it meant?

1666
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,050
Ball fondling.

1667
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,170
I don't know.

1668
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:08,250
Like, maybe he's a basketball fan.

1669
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,530
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1670
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:12,570
Or like, movie Labyrinth, where David Bowie does the thing with the balls.

1671
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,170
I want that guy banned in every chat.

1672
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:16,090
Every single person streaming right now.

1673
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:17,610
Why are you talking to the vending machine?

1674
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,210
That's not a real person on there.

1675
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,409
You know that, right?

1676
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:26,889
You know that that's not a other guy.

1677
01:07:26,969 --> 01:07:28,650
No, I was just, I was like leaning over.

1678
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:30,730
Oh, fuck.

1679
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:33,530
Like, this is a person in the game?

1680
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:34,570
Oh my god.

1681
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,250
Are you able to differentiate the two?

1682
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:41,210
He's got such bad eyesight that he just sees anything vaguely like him.

1683
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:42,730
It looked like it could be a player.

1684
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,130
I don't know.

1685
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:46,409
This guy's been real quiet ever since he had anyone in his chat either.

1686
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:47,849
His PC is like, bricking.

1687
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:50,889
It doesn't look like he's going to be able to join.

1688
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:51,690
Yeah.

1689
01:07:53,289 --> 01:07:53,929
That's not good.

1690
01:07:55,289 --> 01:07:56,170
Are we just going to go with nine or?

1691
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,929
Or do we have one more?

1692
01:07:57,929 --> 01:08:00,889
I could look for another one to build if you want,

1693
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:03,289
but we can also just keep going with what we got.

1694
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:06,489
Let's go and then we'll see if maybe we can get someone else in here.

1695
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:08,570
I can't believe I got imposter and I fucked the whole thing up.

1696
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:10,409
Ross is playing with Snuffy at the moment.

1697
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:12,170
Oh my god, did I knock a drink over?

1698
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,730
What was that?

1699
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:13,929
Oh no, okay.

1700
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:16,569
Mike doesn't have VR, but all right, let's just go.

1701
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:17,529
We'll figure it out as we go.

1702
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,619
Hey, if we need a tent, we can get my buddy Ball Fondler.

1703
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:28,779
I don't I don't know about that.

1704
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,979
Anybody but him, Joel.

1705
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:32,539
No, you don't.

1706
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:33,979
You don't want that guy in there.

1707
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:34,779
Everyone's sick.

1708
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:35,420
Jerma's sick.

1709
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:35,899
What the fuck is going on?

1710
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:37,260
Oh, a task immediately.

1711
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,300
I just couldn't speak.

1712
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,979
Already a sabotage.

1713
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:40,300
Okay.

1714
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,380
Wait, which way is it?

1715
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:46,699
Yeah, two.

1716
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,140
Okay, okay.

1717
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:50,699
I can't do this.

1718
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:51,100
I don't know.

1719
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:51,739
I don't know my shape.

1720
01:08:51,739 --> 01:08:52,779
You have to press the button.

1721
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:53,420
The pattern.

1722
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:53,739
I got it.

1723
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:55,100
It's the zero plus.

1724
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:55,979
Get out of the way.

1725
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:56,779
I'll do it.

1726
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:57,340
There I got it.

1727
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:57,819
I got it.

1728
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:58,699
I got it.

1729
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:00,300
I got it.

1730
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:00,539
Okay.

1731
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:05,100
That's what your Russian got us.

1732
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:05,819
Someone's died.

1733
01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:09,659
Wait, you're not dead.

1734
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:17,260
That's weird.

1735
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:17,899
He's a zombie.

1736
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:22,539
That's weird.

1737
01:09:22,539 --> 01:09:23,659
Why is his name red?

1738
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,159
What?

1739
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,579
That means your name's red.

1740
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:31,340
Wait, whose name is red?

1741
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,300
Wait, why is he red?

1742
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,260
Somebody donated money and it was very loud.

1743
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:36,380
Congratulations.

1744
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,420
I think that we should skip the vote.

1745
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,159
Why did you have die and now you are alive?

1746
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:45,880
I don't know.

1747
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,239
Why is my name red?

1748
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:49,079
Hey, fellas, I think we should skip the vote.

1749
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,000
Somebody said we should skip.

1750
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,960
Wait, can I repeat?

1751
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,680
Someone said we should skip.

1752
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,399
Yeah, we should skip.

1753
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:53,960
Boy, I did hear that.

1754
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,199
I think skip but plus one sus to jolly.

1755
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:57,239
Yeah, that was weird.

1756
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:00,279
I swear to God.

1757
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,600
I will kill you again in a very public setting.

1758
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,720
I bet we will.

1759
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,520
Come again one more time.

1760
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,319
Excuse me.

1761
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:10,760
Excuse me.

1762
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,800
What do you mean by that?

1763
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,479
All right, I got to take the sub goal off my stream

1764
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:14,279
before I fucking puke.

1765
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:16,779
What?

1766
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,880
Okay, wait, how do you do it?

1767
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,479
This ship is falling apart.

1768
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:22,920
Match the pattern on the note.

1769
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,760
Every single person game.

1770
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,279
What the fuck is going on?

1771
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,840
Wait, what's going on?

1772
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,880
Get rid of him.

1773
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,520
Get rid of him.

1774
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:33,880
Get rid of him.

1775
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,199
Guys, we're supposed to report dead bodies.

1776
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,960
You can't just keep on reporting this guy

1777
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,760
because he's alive.

1778
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:45,399
I'm going to the emergency room.

1779
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:48,680
Fuck this.

1780
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,720
I think we need to save him.

1781
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,199
I think we need to save him.

1782
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:50,699
We have to save him.

1783
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:51,479
Stop calling the media.

1784
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:53,319
Just because you want this guy to be dead.

1785
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:55,159
I'm sucking us all out of here.

1786
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:55,659
Please.

1787
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:57,159
Why don't we follow fail vote?

1788
01:10:57,159 --> 01:10:57,880
Yeah, follow me.

1789
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,920
I want to die as well, but I don't make a big deal of it.

1790
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,420
Okay.

1791
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,520
Is this the first time too?

1792
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,359
We'll find the body with fail vote.

1793
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:05,560
I'm going to skip the vote.

1794
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,060
All right.

1795
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,640
We follow you.

1796
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,920
No, but there's a sabotage going on.

1797
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:09,960
We can't waste time.

1798
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,439
Follow me.

1799
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:11,319
It's at the sabotage.

1800
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:12,600
It's at the sabotage.

1801
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,560
Jolly, you go first.

1802
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,520
Jolly goes first in front of everybody.

1803
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,359
Yeah, report your own body, Jolly.

1804
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:19,560
Just stay right there.

1805
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,720
Every single person get over here.

1806
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,159
Every single person get over here.

1807
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:27,640
This is Ball Fondler's fault.

1808
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,359
I know it is.

1809
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:30,840
Let him go first.

1810
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,680
That's how we do it.

1811
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:34,279
Okay.

1812
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,399
Where's the body?

1813
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:35,800
Okay.

1814
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,199
Okay.

1815
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:36,760
Can any...

1816
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,399
Oh my God.

1817
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:38,279
No, there's no body.

1818
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,159
Somebody could kill right now and we would never know.

1819
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,220
Are you recording this?

1820
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,100
Yes, I am.

1821
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:03,739
Okay, good.

1822
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:05,260
So you can show us later.

1823
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:05,739
It's probably...

1824
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:06,619
Yes, I can probably.

1825
01:12:06,619 --> 01:12:07,899
It's gotta be glitch.

1826
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:09,260
Yes, yeah, probably.

1827
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:09,659
Okay.

1828
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,260
I saw my own body earlier, which was really out of body experience.

1829
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:15,100
Yeah, it messed me up.

1830
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:15,579
Fuck.

1831
01:12:15,579 --> 01:12:16,380
This game is like...

1832
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,899
I'm still recovering SCP.

1833
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:18,859
Yeah, therapy.

1834
01:12:18,859 --> 01:12:20,539
Yeah, therapy can't even kill that one.

1835
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:21,420
Damn it.

1836
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:21,979
All right, cool.

1837
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:23,340
You gonna go potty?

1838
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:24,619
Okay.

1839
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,460
I voted for myself.

1840
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,579
Yeah, how you doing over there?

1841
01:12:27,579 --> 01:12:28,699
You holding up?

1842
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:31,260
Just so goddamn stressful.

1843
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,899
I'm gonna put my hand on your hand.

1844
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:35,579
We're gonna calm you down here.

1845
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:37,579
Hold my hand, hold my hand, hold my hand.

1846
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:38,140
Hold my hand.

1847
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:39,420
Who's talking?

1848
01:12:40,539 --> 01:12:41,340
Oh, it's you.

1849
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,300
Failboat, failboat.

1850
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:42,779
Hello.

1851
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:43,420
Okay, you ready?

1852
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,380
Hold my hand.

1853
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,020
There you go.

1854
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,460
Patty cake, patty cake.

1855
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,739
Bake me a cake.

1856
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:48,699
Oh, my bad.

1857
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:49,899
Hey, put your hand...

1858
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:50,300
Ready?

1859
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:50,539
Ready?

1860
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:51,100
Come on, come on.

1861
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:51,340
We can do it.

1862
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:51,899
Chuck.

1863
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:54,060
You know that game, the slap game game?

1864
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:54,300
Ready?

1865
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,100
Yo, yo, slap game, slap game.

1866
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,699
I think we should feed this warning.

1867
01:12:56,699 --> 01:12:57,340
Okay, okay, okay.

1868
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,300
Go, go ahead, go ahead.

1869
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,979
I'm gonna trust you.

1870
01:12:59,979 --> 01:13:01,180
We have a job to do, guys.

1871
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:03,100
Okay, okay, take it serious, buddy.

1872
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,340
Okay, let's go this way.

1873
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,100
All right, let's...

1874
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,380
Everybody run in the same direction.

1875
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:09,340
Fucking...

1876
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10,539
Come on, everybody, let's go.

1877
01:13:10,539 --> 01:13:11,420
Is that all of us?

1878
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:13,739
Don't forget anybody.

1879
01:13:14,619 --> 01:13:17,000
Are we all...

1880
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,880
Are we gonna do it or...

1881
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,159
I got this, I got it, I got it.

1882
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:19,960
I think we got it.

1883
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,239
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1884
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:22,199
I did it, I did it.

1885
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:23,159
No, we need the other one.

1886
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,359
We got it.

1887
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:25,239
Yeah, that's true.

1888
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:25,880
Hey, we did it.

1889
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,439
Good job, everyone.

1890
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:27,079
Good job, good job.

1891
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:27,880
We're good, we're good.

1892
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,159
How about we just do our job?

1893
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:30,439
We can just actually do our job.

1894
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,000
You're working well.

1895
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:31,880
There's a couple in here.

1896
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,319
Let's just do the tasks.

1897
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:34,359
I'll do this one here.

1898
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:35,000
What is this one?

1899
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,069
This one is downloading a little bit of data here.

1900
01:13:39,069 --> 01:13:39,869
That's pretty cool.

1901
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,350
What's going on with you?

1902
01:13:43,229 --> 01:13:43,869
I don't know, man.

1903
01:13:43,869 --> 01:13:45,229
What's going on with you?

1904
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:47,390
You are in a weird spot over there.

1905
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:49,609
I don't know what's weird about the spot I'm in.

1906
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:51,050
No, it's a real task.

1907
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:51,770
It's a real task.

1908
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:56,729
Why can't I speak to my friend from the corner of a wall?

1909
01:13:58,409 --> 01:13:59,289
My tasks are complete.

1910
01:13:59,289 --> 01:13:59,930
What about yours?

1911
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,199
Finishing up here.

1912
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:03,439
OK.

1913
01:14:07,869 --> 01:14:08,909
Being weird on purpose, I think.

1914
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:12,270
Why can't I be weird on purpose?

1915
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:16,510
I'm going to be weird on purpose.

1916
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:17,229
Is he actually dead?

1917
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:19,550
What?

1918
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:20,029
I'm real.

1919
01:14:20,029 --> 01:14:21,710
I can't report any bodies.

1920
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:24,670
I think we may need to remake the lobby.

1921
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:25,470
Let's kill Philbo.

1922
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:26,270
Let's kill Philbo.

1923
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,149
That way that'll fix it.

1924
01:14:29,149 --> 01:14:31,390
I don't think I have any defense on this one.

1925
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:33,710
I blame Ball Fondler for this whole thing.

1926
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:34,510
He's dead, people.

1927
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:36,750
Yeah, we just gotta play ball fondler for this.

1928
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:37,869
He's having premonitions.

1929
01:14:37,869 --> 01:14:38,590
It was Ball Fondler.

1930
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:40,029
It was Ball Fondler.

1931
01:14:40,029 --> 01:14:41,869
Guys, I can see the future.

1932
01:14:41,869 --> 01:14:43,630
He's going to be dead in admin in 30 seconds.

1933
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,989
First Pink's going to die.

1934
01:14:44,989 --> 01:14:46,029
Then Red's going to die.

1935
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:49,949
It's going to be Ranboo.

1936
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:51,550
And then it's going to be Char.

1937
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:53,069
And then it's going to be me.

1938
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:54,909
See ya.

1939
01:14:54,909 --> 01:14:56,590
Get him off the fucking ship.

1940
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:57,390
Get him out of here.

1941
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:58,109
It's so sad.

1942
01:14:58,109 --> 01:14:59,869
Goodbye, premonition man.

1943
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:00,989
Who walked up to me at the end?

1944
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:03,630
Premonition man, that sounds like a good movie title was.

1945
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:04,829
It's time to sleep with the fishes.

1946
01:15:04,829 --> 01:15:05,789
That was pretty good.

1947
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:09,149
Except for the space dirt.

1948
01:15:09,149 --> 01:15:09,710
Whatever it is.

1949
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,189
That's space dirt.

1950
01:15:12,189 --> 01:15:13,149
Stars?

1951
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:14,189
That's not what space dirt is.

1952
01:15:15,869 --> 01:15:16,829
Jerma, you gotta vote.

1953
01:15:16,829 --> 01:15:17,470
Kill me.

1954
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,229
Stars are going to space dirt.

1955
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:19,729
Okay.

1956
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,949
Yeah, you just get rid of Philbo.

1957
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:22,590
That's fine.

1958
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,109
Alright, goodbye everybody.

1959
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:26,029
Hopefully I don't see any more bodies in hell.

1960
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:26,829
Goodbye.

1961
01:15:26,829 --> 01:15:27,869
You know what would be so awesome?

1962
01:15:27,869 --> 01:15:31,149
If we had an Among Us emergency meeting button cake for my birthday.

1963
01:15:32,939 --> 01:15:38,670
Well, he's gone so everything now should be great.

1964
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:39,170
Okay.

1965
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:54,989
No, no, no, no.

1966
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:56,930
Stop.

1967
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,909
I'm just, I'm not, it's not me.

1968
01:15:58,909 --> 01:15:59,789
I'm just fucking around.

1969
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:01,479
I'm trying to scare everybody.

1970
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:04,989
I'm just, I would have done it already.

1971
01:16:04,989 --> 01:16:05,869
You can't be doing this man.

1972
01:16:05,869 --> 01:16:06,829
I would have done it already.

1973
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,100
Oh yeah, yeah.

1974
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:09,899
What's stopping you now?

1975
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:10,939
It's pitch black.

1976
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:13,579
Because I'm one of your crew friends.

1977
01:16:14,829 --> 01:16:15,470
Okay.

1978
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,069
No, I just was doing that to freak out.

1979
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:18,510
You know, like Vinny.

1980
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:18,989
You know what I mean?

1981
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:24,680
Hi, I'm just playing.

1982
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,039
I was doing my task guys.

1983
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,079
What did you do?

1984
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,359
What happened?

1985
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:32,359
I'm going, I'm out of here.

1986
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:34,199
I'm going to do my, there's another person in this room.

1987
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:43,359
Okay.

1988
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,380
How do I even do this?

1989
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,539
What, how do I do this one?

1990
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,149
How do I do this mission?

1991
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:54,590
Somebody can help me with this one?

1992
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:56,109
What's going on?

1993
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:00,010
Do I have to stand still?

1994
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,960
I don't, I don't, somebody, somebody has to help me do this one.

1995
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,539
Hey fellas, can somebody help me do this?

1996
01:17:08,539 --> 01:17:09,340
This is really suspicious.

1997
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,460
But can somebody help me do this?

1998
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:12,159
Yeah, what's up?

1999
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:12,800
I just don't know.

2000
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,640
I don't understand how this one works and I mean it.

2001
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,649
Okay, which one?

2002
01:17:16,649 --> 01:17:18,569
This, this one over here with like the thing with this.

2003
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:21,069
You just have to not move.

2004
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:22,430
You have to stand completely still.

2005
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:23,069
I'll watch your back.

2006
01:17:23,069 --> 01:17:23,630
Hey, don't worry.

2007
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,590
No one's coming in here.

2008
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:25,949
He, you're going to watch my back.

2009
01:17:26,829 --> 01:17:28,989
You, Vinny, Vinny, you watch Kraken's back.

2010
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:30,590
Somebody watch Kraken's back and somebody watch Vinny.

2011
01:17:41,149 --> 01:17:41,869
Hey, don't come in.

2012
01:17:41,869 --> 01:17:43,069
We got a task in here, guys.

2013
01:17:43,069 --> 01:17:43,869
You got to be chill.

2014
01:17:43,869 --> 01:17:44,369
Okay.

2015
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:45,789
Don't cross the little line.

2016
01:17:45,789 --> 01:17:46,590
How does it, how does it?

2017
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:52,189
I think you just put your finger on it and then you just stay still for like 15 seconds.

2018
01:17:52,189 --> 01:17:53,630
Hey, don't cross the line.

2019
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:55,710
There's this is a no entry.

2020
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:56,350
Okay.

2021
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:56,670
Okay.

2022
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:57,149
No entry.

2023
01:17:57,149 --> 01:17:57,630
I'm sorry.

2024
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:57,869
Okay.

2025
01:17:57,869 --> 01:17:58,270
Got it.

2026
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:58,829
All right.

2027
01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:00,350
Hey, where's the Kraken going?

2028
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:01,949
I trust you now because it could, you could have done that.

2029
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:05,149
He said that he was going to go over there to check to see if there was a body anywhere

2030
01:18:05,149 --> 01:18:06,350
because he doesn't trust me.

2031
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:06,909
So yeah.

2032
01:18:06,909 --> 01:18:09,149
Well, where's his, where's his body now?

2033
01:18:10,109 --> 01:18:11,149
Where's his body now?

2034
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,470
I don't know where his body is.

2035
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,189
One, two, three, four, five.

2036
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,710
I didn't make him a body.

2037
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,310
Hey, we're just doing a group call over here.

2038
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:22,590
He told people to not follow him, which I thought was.

2039
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:28,479
I mean, look at the map.

2040
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:29,760
Kraken, Kraken still alive.

2041
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,159
Kraken.

2042
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:30,720
He has to be.

2043
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:33,039
Yeah, no, Kraken has to be still alive.

2044
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:38,800
Oh, oh, Kraken.

2045
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,680
Where did you go?

2046
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,319
Where did you go?

2047
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:40,640
All right.

2048
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,039
Hello.

2049
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:42,399
There are two dead bodies.

2050
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:43,199
Yeah.

2051
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,720
I saw you go in there to report them.

2052
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,119
Yeah.

2053
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:47,920
Well, no, no, no.

2054
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,319
You're right.

2055
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,439
I saw your report.

2056
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:51,119
Did you hear the escalation of the voice?

2057
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:51,600
Did you hear that?

2058
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,960
The rest of us were together.

2059
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,640
Do you remember that entire show about the guy that like.

2060
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:54,960
Kraken.

2061
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:55,840
Tell people lied.

2062
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,359
Kraken, I trusted you.

2063
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:01,119
Would I really walk in alone to a room and report bodies if I did the killing?

2064
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,920
What was the name of that show?

2065
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,399
Uh.

2066
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,279
That's a strategy.

2067
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:04,319
Yeah, it is a strategy.

2068
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:05,520
What do you mean?

2069
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,920
No, he's like, you see, you see what you did with the eye there.

2070
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,439
You see what you did with your eyeball there.

2071
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:11,680
It was, it was an entire, they made like four or five seasons of this show.

2072
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,239
I think it's not.

2073
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:12,720
What was it called?

2074
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,279
Jerma.

2075
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:13,680
Lie to me.

2076
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,479
I was with Jerma.

2077
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,840
Sorry, he's talking to himself.

2078
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,039
I don't think it's you because when I walked up behind you, you genuinely were scared when

2079
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,239
there was someone else in the room when it was troubling you, which means I think it's

2080
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,159
most likely you and you.

2081
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:28,960
I think it's these two guys.

2082
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,600
I can vouch.

2083
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,840
I can vouch for like 30 minutes.

2084
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:32,560
It's not jolly.

2085
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,039
I can vouch.

2086
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:33,760
I literally followed him.

2087
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,340
I was about to came from somewhere that no one else was.

2088
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,899
I traced your footsteps backwards, right?

2089
01:19:39,899 --> 01:19:41,659
And then I found a body with the two dead bodies.

2090
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,659
Jolly was with us almost the whole time.

2091
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:45,579
Came from the navigation panel.

2092
01:19:45,579 --> 01:19:47,659
I didn't even go to down.

2093
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:48,460
You were there the whole time.

2094
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:49,239
Yeah.

2095
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:50,439
I never said where the bodies were.

2096
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:51,640
I never said where the bodies were.

2097
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,199
I think it's him.

2098
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:53,880
That's where you, that's where you were.

2099
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,159
We saw you walk in there.

2100
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:58,119
Yeah, that's where the bodies were.

2101
01:19:58,119 --> 01:19:59,720
And I think you fucking left them there.

2102
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,079
I don't.

2103
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:02,359
How can I kill two people?

2104
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:04,039
You and the other guy.

2105
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,479
Oh, I don't know.

2106
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:12,760
I'm voting for, I'm sorry.

2107
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,399
I'm sorry.

2108
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,180
I don't think it's me.

2109
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,939
I mean, you were, you were around.

2110
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:17,819
I'm suspicious of you.

2111
01:20:19,579 --> 01:20:19,739
Yeah.

2112
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:20,539
How certain are you?

2113
01:20:20,539 --> 01:20:21,020
It's not you.

2114
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:23,869
Yep.

2115
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:24,189
Yes.

2116
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,430
Well, there you go.

2117
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:27,710
I'm sorry.

2118
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:28,750
I doubted you guys.

2119
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:29,310
Yeah.

2120
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:29,789
Thank you.

2121
01:20:29,789 --> 01:20:30,270
Thank you.

2122
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:30,829
I can.

2123
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:32,909
Listen, I know you went off and I, I.

2124
01:20:32,909 --> 01:20:33,550
You weren't moving.

2125
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:34,510
You could have been in the menu.

2126
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,149
You were in the menu.

2127
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:36,670
He was the only one not moving.

2128
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:37,390
He was in the menu.

2129
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:38,350
He was in the menu, I think.

2130
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:39,949
I'm still in the menu.

2131
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:40,430
Yeah.

2132
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:42,590
He's probably doing sabotage.

2133
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:45,390
One sabotage.

2134
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:46,350
I'll get the one.

2135
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:47,789
Oh, shit.

2136
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:48,750
Oh, God.

2137
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:49,310
I got to get this one.

2138
01:20:49,949 --> 01:20:50,989
Did we get it?

2139
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:53,930
Oh, don't leave me alone.

2140
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:54,569
Don't leave me alone.

2141
01:20:54,569 --> 01:20:55,289
Don't leave me alone.

2142
01:20:57,979 --> 01:20:58,939
Did you come out of that, Vin?

2143
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:01,500
No, I just fixed the sabotage.

2144
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:01,819
He did.

2145
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:03,020
He did fix the sabotage.

2146
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:03,340
She did.

2147
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:04,140
Okay.

2148
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,340
What is wrong with you?

2149
01:21:06,939 --> 01:21:07,659
I'm chill, guys.

2150
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:07,899
Sorry.

2151
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:08,460
I panicked.

2152
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,260
I just, I just.

2153
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:09,819
Amazing.

2154
01:21:09,819 --> 01:21:11,020
I jumped to conclusions.

2155
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:11,579
Holy shit.

2156
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:13,020
Really, really nice of you to join us.

2157
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:13,420
Holy shit.

2158
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:14,380
Nice of you to join us.

2159
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:15,020
Hey, yes.

2160
01:21:15,819 --> 01:21:17,039
Yeah, where were you, huh?

2161
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:21,279
Literally, everybody that is still alive is in this room.

2162
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:22,720
It is nice to join you.

2163
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,039
Yeah.

2164
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,720
Where did Vinny go?

2165
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:25,840
Let's show him together.

2166
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,279
So I'm here, I'm doing my tasks.

2167
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:28,079
I'm trying to get us to windows.

2168
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:28,800
I got to do my tasks, too.

2169
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:34,430
Wait, hold on.

2170
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:34,909
Hey.

2171
01:21:34,909 --> 01:21:35,710
Does he have guns?

2172
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:36,350
You got a chance.

2173
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:36,989
Hey, how's it going?

2174
01:21:36,989 --> 01:21:37,550
You got a chance.

2175
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:38,189
Might as well take it.

2176
01:21:38,189 --> 01:21:38,829
Thank you very much.

2177
01:21:38,829 --> 01:21:39,710
Might as well take it right now.

2178
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:41,390
Thank you very much for vouching for me before.

2179
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:42,270
I appreciate it.

2180
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:42,750
Go for it.

2181
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:43,390
Let's see it.

2182
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:44,029
Come on.

2183
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:44,350
Do it.

2184
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,029
Do it, then.

2185
01:21:46,029 --> 01:21:46,350
Come on.

2186
01:21:47,229 --> 01:21:47,550
Do it.

2187
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:49,880
That wouldn't be right.

2188
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,560
The comedic timing is all off.

2189
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,279
See, why don't you do it?

2190
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:53,239
Oh, god damn it.

2191
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:54,439
I told you.

2192
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:55,000
I knew it.

2193
01:21:58,409 --> 01:21:59,850
Somebody find me.

2194
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:00,729
This is awful.

2195
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:09,520
The comedic timing.

2196
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,560
Oh, my god.

2197
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,600
Well, he did it.

2198
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,319
He did do it.

2199
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:13,119
I got it.

2200
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:14,560
And oh, they're going to know.

2201
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,279
They're going to know.

2202
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:17,199
What were the loos?

2203
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,949
Did we get it?

2204
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:23,039
They got it.

2205
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:23,600
Oh, my god.

2206
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:31,689
They actually got it.

2207
01:22:31,689 --> 01:22:32,810
Where is everybody?

2208
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,880
I can't go that way.

2209
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:37,369
Am I just trapped here?

2210
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,869
How do I get out of here?

2211
01:22:39,869 --> 01:22:44,270
Oh, to be me, man.

2212
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,710
I really don't want to be me.

2213
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:58,829
I just taunted him.

2214
01:22:58,829 --> 01:22:59,470
I just want to.

2215
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:03,390
I walked up to him when I was like me.

2216
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:04,510
I was like, why don't you fucking do it?

2217
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:05,310
I was like, dude, already.

2218
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:05,789
And he did it.

2219
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:14,119
Oh, I want to listen in here.

2220
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:14,619
Yeah.

2221
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:30,520
He's just quiet.

2222
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,640
He's not even speaking.

2223
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,600
He's got chocolate all over his face.

2224
01:23:39,399 --> 01:23:40,600
He ate the whole cake.

2225
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,239
They're not even looking.

2226
01:23:41,239 --> 01:23:42,520
He's got chocolate all over his face.

2227
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,039
He ate the whole cake and no one's even looking.

2228
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,239
He ate the whole cake.

2229
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:14,960
Yeah, it's a 3v1 right now.

2230
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,800
To get to the task, which is a fair thing to do.

2231
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,000
But to be fair, it seems more like they're just all arguing.

2232
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:24,720
He doesn't have to do anything and he'll win.

2233
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,199
He wins.

2234
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,399
Yeah, he's good.

2235
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:27,520
He wouldn't have to do anything.

2236
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,720
He's causing everyone to.

2237
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,159
Oh, my god.

2238
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:31,520
Oh, my god.

2239
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,000
You got it.

2240
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,960
He's going to win.

2241
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,840
He's going to win.

2242
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:36,000
He's going to win.

2243
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,560
I can't fucking believe it.

2244
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,560
I missed like half of that conversation

2245
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:47,199
He was in the fucking menu when we were walking that time.

2246
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,319
He didn't leave the room.

2247
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:01,119
Kill someone.

2248
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,159
I got locked out.

2249
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:16,880
I got locked out.

2250
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:28,859
I can't believe it.

2251
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:36,060
God damn it.

2252
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,819
I'm turning this off.

2253
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:43,020
That was funny for an hour.

2254
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:51,119
Just telling you to move.

2255
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:51,920
Why am I still dead?

2256
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:56,560
Why do I still have ghost sounds?

2257
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:10,699
I can't believe I taunted you and everything.

2258
01:26:17,949 --> 01:26:20,029
The best part is you were sitting there the whole time.

2259
01:26:20,029 --> 01:26:22,590
They were arguing back and forth for like 10 straight minutes.

2260
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:23,470
And you're just going like this.

2261
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,529
You guys didn't even ask him a question.

2262
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:28,890
You didn't even ask him a question.

2263
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,199
He may have come from my neck of the woods here.

2264
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:00,649
All right, new lobby.

2265
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,640
What happened?

2266
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,880
The game crashed?

2267
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,520
The game crashed.

2268
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:11,710
Oh my god, it's so funny.

2269
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,199
I gotta get to the menu.

2270
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:18,909
Where's the menu?

2271
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:21,869
No menu?

2272
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,550
No access to the menu?

2273
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:29,210
I think I have to restart the game.

2274
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:29,850
Oh, no, we're good.

2275
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:30,489
Okay.

2276
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:31,050
Be able to connect.

2277
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:32,409
All right.

2278
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:35,930
All right, I gotta put the screen off for a sec.

2279
01:27:38,779 --> 01:27:44,079
Because I don't want you to see the lobby code.

2280
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:45,979
I did that last time.

2281
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:49,840
Okay, give me one sec.

2282
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,560
How's everybody doing?

2283
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:54,810
Oh my god, there's like 46,000 people here.

2284
01:27:57,359 --> 01:27:58,800
I gotta play Among Us more often.

2285
01:28:04,489 --> 01:28:09,920
All right, let me please do the sus face.

2286
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,399
You got it.

2287
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:17,210
That's actually what it was.

2288
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:18,250
That was actually the face.

2289
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:25,949
I think we'll make it.

2290
01:28:25,949 --> 01:28:26,750
They're making a new lobby.

2291
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:33,800
Lobby is currently going up.

2292
01:28:36,989 --> 01:28:39,770
Give me one more second.

2293
01:28:40,329 --> 01:28:45,130
It looks good.

2294
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:47,449
Just making sure the stream looks good.

2295
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:53,689
All right, joining the lobby now.

2296
01:28:53,689 --> 01:28:54,890
And he's gonna memorize it.

2297
01:28:55,609 --> 01:28:57,949
Is that a...

2298
01:28:57,949 --> 01:28:58,590
Yeah.

2299
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:03,229
Okay.

2300
01:29:03,229 --> 01:29:04,189
You guys can't see, right?

2301
01:29:04,189 --> 01:29:04,430
No.

2302
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:04,829
Okay.

2303
01:29:04,829 --> 01:29:12,079
Is that correct?

2304
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:17,069
I believe that is correct.

2305
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:21,819
And...

2306
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:28,539
Hey, I think...

2307
01:29:28,539 --> 01:29:28,939
Okay.

2308
01:29:28,939 --> 01:29:31,340
I had to leave because everybody was still in death.

2309
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:31,899
Like death.

2310
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:33,659
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2311
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:34,380
Yeah.

2312
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,020
Oh, what the hell?

2313
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:35,979
We have some weird like...

2314
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:38,220
The colors are changed.

2315
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:38,779
Oh, no.

2316
01:29:38,779 --> 01:29:39,500
My god.

2317
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,779
You're red now.

2318
01:29:40,779 --> 01:29:42,300
You're blue now.

2319
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,020
Oh, I'm blue.

2320
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:44,539
You're blue.

2321
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:47,079
Sorry if it's loud.

2322
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:47,880
Twitter blue.

2323
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:49,880
I'm blue.

2324
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,600
I'm back.

2325
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,039
I can't believe it happened.

2326
01:29:52,039 --> 01:29:52,840
Eight dollars.

2327
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:54,670
All right.

2328
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:56,430
Eight dollars.

2329
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:00,720
I'm ready to be the imposter.

2330
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:04,600
Hey, can you guys hear me?

2331
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,560
You have seven people in here?

2332
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:06,039
Can you hear me?

2333
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:06,760
Yes.

2334
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,239
Okay, good.

2335
01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:07,720
Thank god.

2336
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:08,680
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2337
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,560
I see six people.

2338
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:10,279
Who's the seventh?

2339
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:12,520
All right.

2340
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,079
Eight people.

2341
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:13,479
What the hell?

2342
01:30:13,479 --> 01:30:14,279
I don't see anyone.

2343
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,600
Yeah, we're back.

2344
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,279
Oh, there we go.

2345
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:18,760
There we go.

2346
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,000
Oh, I'm pink now.

2347
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,199
The whole world is so...

2348
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:23,640
No, that's correct.

2349
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:25,319
This is weird.

2350
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:26,920
I'm your color now.

2351
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:27,720
Oh, this is weird.

2352
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,199
Yeah, it is.

2353
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:28,520
You're me.

2354
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,319
I've graduated.

2355
01:30:29,319 --> 01:30:29,880
It's a bit weird.

2356
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,800
You're playing with streamers you don't know too well.

2357
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,319
Me and Ross were playing Amogus VR in VRChat.

2358
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:39,159
We were absolutely playing with randos.

2359
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,600
I'll tell you what, though.

2360
01:30:41,239 --> 01:30:42,600
I know Gascan.

2361
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,479
I know Liam.

2362
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:44,680
I know ZamSire.

2363
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:45,479
I know Failboat.

2364
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:48,039
I've met Failboat in person a bunch.

2365
01:30:48,039 --> 01:30:49,319
Kraikin's a good friend.

2366
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,319
I know almost everyone here pretty well.

2367
01:30:52,119 --> 01:30:53,399
There's a couple dudes I don't know.

2368
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:55,239
I really wish you could do finger guns.

2369
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,159
Like he started to turn.

2370
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:57,659
No.

2371
01:31:02,199 --> 01:31:02,680
All right.

2372
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,180
Wait.

2373
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:05,239
Vinny.

2374
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:05,720
There we go.

2375
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,119
Yo.

2376
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:06,520
Hi.

2377
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:06,920
Hello.

2378
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,000
Oh, that works.

2379
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,199
We combined the two.

2380
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:10,760
I'm here.

2381
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,000
We're missing anyone else from the lobby.

2382
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,520
Wait, you got finger guns on?

2383
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,000
Yeah.

2384
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,880
You combined thumbs up and points.

2385
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,319
Oh, is this the TF2 Scout?

2386
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:19,819
Nice.

2387
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:21,479
Oh, wait.

2388
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:22,199
I don't want that.

2389
01:31:26,699 --> 01:31:27,579
I mean, it's cool.

2390
01:31:27,579 --> 01:31:27,899
It's cool.

2391
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:29,020
But I don't want to.

2392
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,300
Oh, I see what you're doing.

2393
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:30,779
It's cool.

2394
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,340
So point and thumb.

2395
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:35,659
Thumbs up and point.

2396
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:36,699
Oh, there we go.

2397
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:39,789
That's it.

2398
01:31:39,789 --> 01:31:41,869
There we go.

2399
01:31:41,869 --> 01:31:42,829
Nah, I'm staying.

2400
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:43,630
I'm staying.

2401
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:45,789
How do you unlock unlocked stuff?

2402
01:31:45,789 --> 01:31:46,510
Don't move.

2403
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:47,390
Who's moving?

2404
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:47,789
Don't move.

2405
01:31:47,789 --> 01:31:48,270
Don't move.

2406
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:48,989
I swear to God.

2407
01:31:49,789 --> 01:31:50,670
There's the DEA.

2408
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:52,430
They've got a gun.

2409
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:54,029
Hey, I don't want to be in trouble, man.

2410
01:31:54,029 --> 01:31:55,149
Bring out the gun.

2411
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:55,949
Fucking childish.

2412
01:31:55,949 --> 01:31:56,430
Hey, hey.

2413
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:57,310
We're out there good.

2414
01:31:57,310 --> 01:31:58,029
Are you guys ready?

2415
01:31:58,029 --> 01:31:58,350
Hands up.

2416
01:31:58,350 --> 01:31:58,850
Hey.

2417
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,829
Guns are not childish.

2418
01:32:00,829 --> 01:32:02,829
I'll have you know that I'm being completely serious right now.

2419
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:05,710
I simply will shoot you.

2420
01:32:06,939 --> 01:32:08,220
OK, I'll see.

2421
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:08,859
I'll see Vinny.

2422
01:32:08,859 --> 01:32:09,500
Begin.

2423
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,939
Yeah, I'm sitting here.

2424
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:11,899
I hope you guys are ready, because I'm

2425
01:32:11,899 --> 01:32:14,619
going to get the imposter this time, and then you're all in fucking trouble.

2426
01:32:14,619 --> 01:32:15,420
Dan.

2427
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:15,819
Hello?

2428
01:32:15,819 --> 01:32:16,699
I don't see Vinny.

2429
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:16,939
Hello?

2430
01:32:16,939 --> 01:32:17,899
Dan, can you hear me?

2431
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,500
I hear you.

2432
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,140
I hear everyone.

2433
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:22,380
Yes, I'm sure you can see me.

2434
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,420
Make sure you can see me.

2435
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:24,460
Hold on.

2436
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,500
Guys, can everyone see me?

2437
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,060
My name is Ray.

2438
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:26,699
Yes, I can see you.

2439
01:32:26,699 --> 01:32:27,819
I can see you, buddy.

2440
01:32:27,819 --> 01:32:28,539
It's just Dan.

2441
01:32:28,539 --> 01:32:29,340
He's glitched again.

2442
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:30,460
Failboat.

2443
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,180
What?

2444
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,300
What are you waiting for?

2445
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,420
No, don't do this.

2446
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:34,140
What are you glitching about?

2447
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:34,779
Why is he?

2448
01:32:34,779 --> 01:32:35,420
Uh-oh.

2449
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:36,460
Don't press it.

2450
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,300
I swear to God, don't press it.

2451
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:38,939
You can't see me.

2452
01:32:39,979 --> 01:32:40,779
No, I hear nothing.

2453
01:32:40,779 --> 01:32:41,819
Everyone, get away from there.

2454
01:32:41,819 --> 01:32:45,340
If you hit the button, you're wasting a very valuable resource.

2455
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,600
I'm going to go do what I'm supposed to be doing.

2456
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,520
I'm trying to join our magic trick.

2457
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,880
I'm totally blind right now.

2458
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,439
Are you going to kill me?

2459
01:32:52,439 --> 01:32:53,479
Head, disappear.

2460
01:32:53,479 --> 01:32:54,680
I'm going to go this way.

2461
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,960
This game is fucking glitching.

2462
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:00,329
OK, crewmates.

2463
01:33:00,329 --> 01:33:01,850
I have the back of my freaking visor with you.

2464
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:02,090
OK?

2465
01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:03,449
Are you guys ready to do some tasks?

2466
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:05,710
Let's go to navigation.

2467
01:33:08,409 --> 01:33:08,649
Stop.

2468
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:08,970
What was that?

2469
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:10,649
What was that?

2470
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:13,050
Guys, I swear I just heard somebody pull a blade out.

2471
01:33:13,609 --> 01:33:15,130
No, I think I'm fine.

2472
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:15,689
I think I'm fine.

2473
01:33:15,689 --> 01:33:16,649
I'm just weird.

2474
01:33:16,649 --> 01:33:17,689
OK, I'm going to do this task.

2475
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:19,920
I'm alone, though.

2476
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,479
I don't like that.

2477
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:22,970
I'm going to get done quick.

2478
01:33:23,609 --> 01:33:24,489
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

2479
01:33:24,489 --> 01:33:25,050
Don't.

2480
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,920
I'm going to...

2481
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:27,640
If somebody comes in here...

2482
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,520
OK, how do I do this?

2483
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,399
I got to...

2484
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:30,409
How does this work?

2485
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:32,890
What do I have to do?

2486
01:33:33,449 --> 01:33:36,090
How does this one work?

2487
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:39,520
Do I have to get the pizza?

2488
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,560
How does this work?

2489
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,119
What do I do?

2490
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:46,119
Oh.

2491
01:33:46,119 --> 01:33:47,319
There's no immediate issue.

2492
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:48,600
Hello.

2493
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:48,840
Hey.

2494
01:33:49,479 --> 01:33:52,810
Hey, we never actually finished the slap game before, by the way.

2495
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:53,289
Yeah.

2496
01:33:53,289 --> 01:33:54,010
You want to do it now?

2497
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:55,609
Yeah, let's do this.

2498
01:33:55,609 --> 01:33:56,729
Actually, we can't see our hands.

2499
01:33:56,729 --> 01:33:57,609
It doesn't really work.

2500
01:33:57,609 --> 01:33:58,329
Oh, OK.

2501
01:33:59,449 --> 01:34:00,569
What's there?

2502
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:02,170
I'm just getting away.

2503
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:02,489
I don't know.

2504
01:34:02,489 --> 01:34:03,210
I don't trust anybody.

2505
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:08,810
He wanted...

2506
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,250
Oh, let's do the slap game.

2507
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:12,010
Yeah, let's do the slap game.

2508
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:13,449
AKA, he's going to do it.

2509
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:14,890
And then...

2510
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:15,369
Oh, ha ha.

2511
01:34:15,369 --> 01:34:17,369
And he's going to kill me when he does it, right?

2512
01:34:17,369 --> 01:34:19,520
Anybody...

2513
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,319
Listen, anybody here?

2514
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,039
Oh, OK.

2515
01:34:24,039 --> 01:34:25,000
I'm going to go do this.

2516
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,840
Hello.

2517
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,319
Get away from me.

2518
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:42,800
Get away from me.

2519
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:44,800
Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away.

2520
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,359
Get away, get away.

2521
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:46,239
I'm doing it.

2522
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:49,210
We already did that.

2523
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:49,689
OK, OK.

2524
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:50,010
We just did it.

2525
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:50,569
We're good, we're good.

2526
01:34:50,569 --> 01:34:52,010
Yeah, me and Zam.

2527
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:52,329
We're good.

2528
01:34:52,329 --> 01:34:53,369
Zam just did it.

2529
01:34:53,449 --> 01:34:54,250
OK, excellent.

2530
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,210
Excellent.

2531
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,600
I vouch for him.

2532
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,560
Task complete over here.

2533
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,399
One, two, three, four.

2534
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:02,119
There we go.

2535
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:02,359
What?

2536
01:35:02,359 --> 01:35:02,600
Oh.

2537
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:05,960
You've been at this task a while, Johnny.

2538
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:07,239
They couldn't see...

2539
01:35:08,359 --> 01:35:10,279
Oh, they don't see that I'm fucking this up.

2540
01:35:10,279 --> 01:35:11,159
Right, right, right.

2541
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:12,119
They don't know that I'm fucking it up.

2542
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:12,359
What?

2543
01:35:12,359 --> 01:35:12,680
I can't...

2544
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:15,689
Uh-oh.

2545
01:35:18,989 --> 01:35:19,630
OK.

2546
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:21,069
OK, task her down.

2547
01:35:21,069 --> 01:35:21,949
Task her down.

2548
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:22,670
Task her down.

2549
01:35:24,109 --> 01:35:25,069
Listen up, everybody.

2550
01:35:25,069 --> 01:35:26,350
I was in electrical.

2551
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:29,069
I walked past Vinnie and Charborg.

2552
01:35:29,069 --> 01:35:30,670
And then I heard a snap.

2553
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:31,869
And Charborg was dead.

2554
01:35:31,869 --> 01:35:34,109
Who else was on the way down to storage?

2555
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:34,670
I don't know.

2556
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:35,710
I literally only saw you two.

2557
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:36,750
You know who it was with you.

2558
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:37,229
It was Failboat.

2559
01:35:37,229 --> 01:35:38,029
I've only seen Cry...

2560
01:35:38,029 --> 01:35:39,069
It was Failboat?

2561
01:35:39,069 --> 01:35:40,109
100% Failboat.

2562
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:40,510
Where?

2563
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:41,229
Behind you.

2564
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:41,789
I can't...

2565
01:35:41,789 --> 01:35:42,750
There's no ghost.

2566
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:43,390
There is no...

2567
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:43,789
I can't...

2568
01:35:43,789 --> 01:35:44,989
I'm sure this isn't a strategy.

2569
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:48,350
No, I can't tell Phantom.

2570
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,149
I don't know where you...

2571
01:35:49,149 --> 01:35:50,989
I have no evidence on where you were even standing.

2572
01:35:50,989 --> 01:35:52,270
You're calling him a Phantom now?

2573
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:52,670
What's going on?

2574
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:53,310
He doesn't see me.

2575
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:54,029
He doesn't see me.

2576
01:35:54,029 --> 01:35:56,189
Wait, can you hear the voice?

2577
01:35:57,149 --> 01:35:58,270
Yeah, can you hear a ghost?

2578
01:35:58,270 --> 01:35:58,590
I don't...

2579
01:35:58,590 --> 01:35:59,149
Can you hear the ghost?

2580
01:35:59,149 --> 01:36:00,350
He can hear the dead.

2581
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,229
So I don't know, dude.

2582
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:02,750
He's not dead yet.

2583
01:36:04,189 --> 01:36:05,789
My personal assessment is...

2584
01:36:05,789 --> 01:36:06,750
I can hear you.

2585
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:07,630
You can.

2586
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:09,710
He's over there in the fucking corner, isn't he?

2587
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:10,590
No, I cannot see you.

2588
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:12,029
I assume you're...

2589
01:36:12,029 --> 01:36:12,989
Jolly!

2590
01:36:12,989 --> 01:36:14,750
Well, I am, but I saw you kill someone.

2591
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:15,229
Come over here.

2592
01:36:15,949 --> 01:36:16,750
What is he doing?

2593
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:19,310
All right, Jolly always never says a thing during meetings.

2594
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:20,670
I can't see what you did.

2595
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:21,310
Can we pause this?

2596
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:23,550
I was just doing a little space, the final frontier bit.

2597
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:24,109
Sure.

2598
01:36:24,109 --> 01:36:24,430
Yeah?

2599
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:25,229
And how's it going?

2600
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:25,869
Well, my...

2601
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:27,390
What do you know about the body?

2602
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:30,590
It's an intentional strategy from Vin just being physical to the imposter.

2603
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:31,789
I can't lose.

2604
01:36:31,789 --> 01:36:32,829
That's the strategy, though.

2605
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:35,069
If you go look out the window while everybody argues,

2606
01:36:35,069 --> 01:36:36,829
no one's going to point the finger at you.

2607
01:36:36,829 --> 01:36:38,109
Yeah, you're being awfully quiet again.

2608
01:36:38,109 --> 01:36:38,750
True.

2609
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,590
Crikey, we wanted to say...

2610
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:42,430
Everybody, just hear me out one more time.

2611
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:46,029
Crikey reported the body, but Baleboat was literally right behind him.

2612
01:36:46,029 --> 01:36:48,029
I swear, Crikey and Baleboat...

2613
01:36:48,029 --> 01:36:48,989
Please vote Baleboat.

2614
01:36:48,989 --> 01:36:50,270
I follow Crikey.

2615
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,470
Believe me.

2616
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,189
I trust Vinny.

2617
01:36:52,189 --> 01:36:53,390
Believe me.

2618
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,149
I can't believe you as much as I can see you.

2619
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:56,270
I can't believe it, man.

2620
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:58,430
Excuse me?

2621
01:36:58,430 --> 01:36:59,069
Oh, brother.

2622
01:36:59,069 --> 01:36:59,789
That's three.

2623
01:36:59,789 --> 01:37:00,590
That might be enough.

2624
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:02,510
Later.

2625
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:03,470
Oh, you got it.

2626
01:37:04,829 --> 01:37:05,229
Got it.

2627
01:37:05,229 --> 01:37:05,710
Nice job.

2628
01:37:07,869 --> 01:37:10,270
You sure you didn't know who was behind you?

2629
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:11,789
No, I literally didn't see anyone else.

2630
01:37:11,789 --> 01:37:13,149
Jolly was following you.

2631
01:37:13,149 --> 01:37:15,069
He was ready to follow me.

2632
01:37:15,069 --> 01:37:16,029
Incredibly important.

2633
01:37:16,029 --> 01:37:18,750
Jolly just went by himself that way and didn't say a goddamn word.

2634
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:19,789
He literally walked through to me.

2635
01:37:19,789 --> 01:37:20,989
He didn't say goodbye.

2636
01:37:20,989 --> 01:37:22,189
Didn't even say goodbye.

2637
01:37:22,189 --> 01:37:22,989
And what do you know?

2638
01:37:23,789 --> 01:37:24,350
What do you know?

2639
01:37:24,909 --> 01:37:26,109
That's a sabotage.

2640
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:27,789
Who the hell would I wonder?

2641
01:37:27,789 --> 01:37:29,550
Let's call the meeting a meeting.

2642
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,029
Yeah.

2643
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:31,550
No, we have to get the sabotage first.

2644
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:31,949
Oh, shit.

2645
01:37:31,949 --> 01:37:32,670
Oh, fuck.

2646
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,199
Yeah, he took off.

2647
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:37,239
Zam's got this one.

2648
01:37:37,239 --> 01:37:40,220
Zam, you got this, right?

2649
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:43,100
I don't know what this means.

2650
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:46,510
Oh, shit.

2651
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:47,710
We might not have enough time.

2652
01:37:48,829 --> 01:37:49,550
Okay, we got it.

2653
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:50,109
We got it.

2654
01:37:50,109 --> 01:37:51,310
Jeremy, you doing all right?

2655
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:51,869
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2656
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:53,949
If I die, just let me know.

2657
01:37:53,949 --> 01:37:56,109
I'm telling you, Jolly walked away by himself.

2658
01:37:56,989 --> 01:37:57,550
Okay.

2659
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:58,590
So, all right.

2660
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:59,390
I'll keep an eye on it.

2661
01:37:59,390 --> 01:38:00,430
I'm not the imposter.

2662
01:38:00,989 --> 01:38:01,949
Jeremy, do me a favor.

2663
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,350
When you go to this, can you click it?

2664
01:38:05,069 --> 01:38:05,390
Yeah.

2665
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:11,920
Oh, my God.

2666
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:13,760
Criken.

2667
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:14,159
Okay.

2668
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:14,800
Oh, my God.

2669
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,880
Here's my counter-argument to you all.

2670
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,279
If I was in a room with Criken and Zam,

2671
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:24,479
would I not have killed you immediately for a fucking laugh?

2672
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:26,000
No, because then Zam would have reported you.

2673
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:28,960
Yeah, do you think I care?

2674
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:30,239
I wouldn't have killed you.

2675
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,520
You should have been out.

2676
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,640
There's only one imposter left.

2677
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,119
You wouldn't have done that.

2678
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:36,319
Criken, did you not see the round where I was friends with Liam

2679
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:39,760
and I just ran up and murdered some dude in Cold Blood for fun?

2680
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:41,439
Look, you're a loose cannon.

2681
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:42,000
I get that.

2682
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,640
I then didn't die because you all voted for Liam for some stupid fucking reason.

2683
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:50,000
Explain to us all in this room right now why you left first

2684
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,279
and you didn't say a gosh darn word.

2685
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,199
Bro, my hands are so big.

2686
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:53,840
How come you left?

2687
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,560
How come you left first?

2688
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,880
Criken, it's kind of a sensory overload.

2689
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,680
Yeah, I was going to say.

2690
01:38:58,640 --> 01:38:59,840
Actually, a good answer.

2691
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:00,079
Fuck.

2692
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:03,550
Actually, a good answer.

2693
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:04,109
God damn it.

2694
01:39:04,109 --> 01:39:08,510
Look, we were as soon as Jolly left, there was a sabotage.

2695
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:09,949
We all went to go fix it.

2696
01:39:09,949 --> 01:39:14,029
Jolly, as we were leaving to hit this button, locks the door

2697
01:39:14,909 --> 01:39:16,510
and both of us were stuck inside with him.

2698
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,760
To be fair, you can lock the door from the map.

2699
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,079
So the imposter could have been anywhere to do that.

2700
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,760
Oh, you can lock the door from the map.

2701
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:25,720
Convenient timing.

2702
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,119
I don't know.

2703
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,880
But also, when you walked off and then sabotage happened,

2704
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:30,520
I don't know.

2705
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,760
It also could have been somebody just standing in the group.

2706
01:39:33,479 --> 01:39:34,520
I also think it's Jolly.

2707
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:39,720
We've got people to burn.

2708
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,199
It's OK.

2709
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:41,000
Yeah, exactly.

2710
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,800
Exactly.

2711
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:42,199
Yeah.

2712
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:43,560
Well, I guess my...

2713
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,479
Criken, I just got to pay you back from before.

2714
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:45,880
Sorry.

2715
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,000
Huh?

2716
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,279
Just in case.

2717
01:39:48,279 --> 01:39:49,159
He voted on me.

2718
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:51,720
Just in case.

2719
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,119
I don't know.

2720
01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:55,710
Oh, sorry.

2721
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:57,310
It's Criken.

2722
01:39:57,310 --> 01:39:58,430
Oh, OK.

2723
01:39:58,430 --> 01:39:59,869
I'm just going to run this way.

2724
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:00,510
Why, bro?

2725
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:01,710
Because I voted on you that one time.

2726
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:03,229
I'm Criken.

2727
01:40:03,229 --> 01:40:04,670
Bro, new life rule, OK?

2728
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:05,869
I did all my tasks.

2729
01:40:05,869 --> 01:40:06,829
I'm good.

2730
01:40:06,829 --> 01:40:09,470
And you reported the body as a strat

2731
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:11,069
because you saw me walk in the room.

2732
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:14,029
It is you who is the imposter.

2733
01:40:15,149 --> 01:40:16,029
Oh, wait.

2734
01:40:16,029 --> 01:40:17,069
Hold on now.

2735
01:40:17,069 --> 01:40:19,550
We can't just jump to a conclusion here.

2736
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:20,590
We haven't even said anything.

2737
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:25,069
I'm going to say, Criken,

2738
01:40:25,069 --> 01:40:26,510
it's been nice knowing you, buddy,

2739
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:27,310
but you are the imposter.

2740
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:27,869
What have I done?

2741
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:31,149
I reported the first body and I fucking...

2742
01:40:31,789 --> 01:40:33,470
I think we're shutting him out right now.

2743
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:35,949
Maybe you should practice this move.

2744
01:40:35,949 --> 01:40:36,670
Practice this one.

2745
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:42,779
And then you voted Jolly.

2746
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:44,140
Well, listen, if it was between you and Jolly

2747
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:45,100
and Jolly was not the imposter,

2748
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,779
then it's you who the imposter is.

2749
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:48,619
So I'm voting for you as soon as I can.

2750
01:40:49,819 --> 01:40:51,180
100% disagree.

2751
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,739
I do not have a single thing to say to you anymore, friend.

2752
01:40:53,739 --> 01:40:54,779
Vinny could have killed me,

2753
01:40:54,779 --> 01:40:56,140
and we were in a room alone together,

2754
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:56,939
and he could have killed me.

2755
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:00,060
It was literally like a straight minute.

2756
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:03,340
I don't think we are after information.

2757
01:41:06,939 --> 01:41:09,340
I reported the first body as soon as I saw it.

2758
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:10,539
And then you report another one.

2759
01:41:10,539 --> 01:41:13,420
You are doing 4D chess, bro.

2760
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:18,220
I'm just playing a good fucking crew man.

2761
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:18,720
All right.

2762
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:20,699
Don't give me a thumbs down.

2763
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:21,199
You're lying.

2764
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:23,760
Oh, damn.

2765
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:25,520
I gotta make a decision here.

2766
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,439
I think Vinny's playing the long game here,

2767
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:28,880
and he's fucking calling people out

2768
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,000
and getting them out one at a time.

2769
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,760
You're deflecting.

2770
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,119
He could have killed me so many times.

2771
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:33,920
I'm deflecting because my life's on the line,

2772
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,680
and you're fucking, you're suddenly throwing me on my bus.

2773
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:37,760
Vinny could have sold out failboats to game chumps,

2774
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:38,239
I don't know.

2775
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:41,279
There is some, your voice is doing a thing there.

2776
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,000
It's the same thing that I did when I was telling you

2777
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,119
the story about what happened

2778
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:46,479
when I was fucking being chased around.

2779
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,600
I'm sorry.

2780
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,159
I'm sorry.

2781
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:51,520
I'm sorry, Kraikin.

2782
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,399
If it's not you, then.

2783
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:53,119
It's okay, man.

2784
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:54,239
Your eye twitched.

2785
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:55,039
Your eye twitched.

2786
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:56,180
Gotta go.

2787
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:00,819
All right.

2788
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,180
Okay.

2789
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,479
Kraikin, if our friendship has been irreparably damaged,

2790
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:05,359
I'd like to apologize.

2791
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:06,319
One more new lobby if I can't see Vinny.

2792
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:07,199
Body language.

2793
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:09,840
All right, where's Vinny?

2794
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:10,720
We both get one.

2795
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,760
All right, Vinny.

2796
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,260
Okay.

2797
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,600
Look, Kraikin.

2798
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,079
I still cannot see Vinny.

2799
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:17,920
Hold on, I'm gonna try and re-log.

2800
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,199
Let me try and re-log here.

2801
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,359
Oh, look at all these, look at all these imposters.

2802
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:25,229
The game is tearing you all apart.

2803
01:42:25,949 --> 01:42:32,060
This is for one day only, by the way.

2804
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,590
This shit ain't ever coming back.

2805
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:36,880
I wish I could rescind it.

2806
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:42,210
Are we making a new lobby or are we going with this one?

2807
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:43,250
No, we're sticking with this one.

2808
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,210
Can you just reach over there?

2809
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:45,329
That's so sus, dude.

2810
01:42:45,329 --> 01:42:45,970
Bat chest.

2811
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:51,020
Yeah, and Coney.

2812
01:42:51,979 --> 01:42:53,420
Coney, are you back?

2813
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:55,180
Oh, a little bit slurry today.

2814
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:56,140
Well, it's Coney back.

2815
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,300
I think he's still streaming.

2816
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,340
It says he's still streaming.

2817
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,619
I'm really close to the camera.

2818
01:43:01,979 --> 01:43:03,380
Vinny, please re-log.

2819
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:05,859
Record the Davey's Grey songs with Red Vox and make them better.

2820
01:43:05,859 --> 01:43:06,180
You know what?

2821
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:09,380
What I should have done was just beeline it for Vinny

2822
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:10,899
instead of reporting the body that first one.

2823
01:43:10,899 --> 01:43:12,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2824
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:14,819
I, dude, there's, okay.

2825
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:20,100
Him being an actual TF2 spy, like, I was just like,

2826
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,020
oh, I'm gonna kill someone and Vinny's like, I've seen it.

2827
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:23,060
Do the imposter dance?

2828
01:43:23,859 --> 01:43:26,020
I feel like it's, you point your fingers or something.

2829
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:29,710
It's kind of, it's like a, something like this.

2830
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:31,630
I don't know, probably.

2831
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:36,130
You guys having a good time?

2832
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:37,489
I know I'm not really checking in that often,

2833
01:43:37,489 --> 01:43:38,130
but how you guys doing?

2834
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:38,689
You guys having fun?

2835
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:41,359
You guys enjoying yourselves?

2836
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,659
Well, enjoy it because it's just getting

2837
01:43:44,659 --> 01:43:46,180
fucking torn down tomorrow.

2838
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:52,079
I was just making my stream entertaining by watching yours.

2839
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:54,609
Hey, what?

2840
01:43:54,609 --> 01:43:55,569
You're an entertaining guy.

2841
01:43:55,569 --> 01:43:56,050
What are we talking about?

2842
01:43:58,689 --> 01:44:00,289
I'm entertaining, but I'm also lazy.

2843
01:44:03,069 --> 01:44:04,829
That was a weird sound that came out of my mouth.

2844
01:44:04,829 --> 01:44:05,229
I'm sorry.

2845
01:44:05,949 --> 01:44:06,750
Everyone probably heard it.

2846
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:07,789
I don't have a noise gate on today.

2847
01:44:11,899 --> 01:44:12,939
How we looking?

2848
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:13,899
Oh, my God.

2849
01:44:13,899 --> 01:44:14,460
That's rude.

2850
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:17,260
Who are we missing right now?

2851
01:44:17,979 --> 01:44:18,460
Oh yeah.

2852
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:19,659
Who is who are we missing here?

2853
01:44:23,659 --> 01:44:23,899
All right.

2854
01:44:23,899 --> 01:44:24,539
You didn't hear that.

2855
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:26,779
Can we harmonize?

2856
01:44:28,369 --> 01:44:28,689
Yeah.

2857
01:44:28,689 --> 01:44:29,569
Do you know the Beatles?

2858
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:32,050
No, but okay.

2859
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:34,050
So are you, can you do low or can you do high?

2860
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:35,970
I can do low.

2861
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:38,210
I have COVID so I probably can't do highs,

2862
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:40,689
but I can probably do like, what would you call this?

2863
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:43,010
What's that?

2864
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:47,020
That's like a bad song.

2865
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:47,899
No, that's baritone.

2866
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:49,500
Well, no, I'm just saying.

2867
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:52,779
Oh, that's like pretty beautiful.

2868
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,789
Do we, can we, can we harmonize?

2869
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:57,390
Can you guys do the dumb thing that I want to do?

2870
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:02,430
Tenor, you're a tenor.

2871
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:03,390
Oh, that is what it is.

2872
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:03,789
You're a tenor.

2873
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:04,829
Yeah.

2874
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:10,989
No, I'm thinking more kind of like, oh, I've got a quest too.

2875
01:45:16,189 --> 01:45:17,069
That's beautiful.

2876
01:45:17,069 --> 01:45:19,789
That's music and that's called music.

2877
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:21,310
Can you go that low?

2878
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:29,140
My fucking body hurts now.

2879
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:33,140
That's what it sounds like.

2880
01:45:34,659 --> 01:45:36,500
Like the summertime out in like the woods.

2881
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:38,819
It's just like fucking frogs.

2882
01:45:39,699 --> 01:45:40,819
Frogs and bugs.

2883
01:45:43,699 --> 01:45:44,659
Frogs do that.

2884
01:45:44,659 --> 01:45:46,420
The frogs when they do sing, you know.

2885
01:45:46,979 --> 01:45:52,260
Oh, have you ever listened outside or at like in the summertime in a swampy environment?

2886
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:53,539
Oh, yeah.

2887
01:45:53,539 --> 01:45:56,500
I'll go to interview a frog just for you here.

2888
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,500
What kind of task are you doing right now?

2889
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:03,060
Um, I'm going, my goal is to go to reactor.

2890
01:46:03,939 --> 01:46:07,539
Oh, I'm going to a better use of my time.

2891
01:46:07,539 --> 01:46:07,699
Okay.

2892
01:46:07,699 --> 01:46:10,500
You got that one more motivated because I'm not overly.

2893
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:16,750
If I'm going to spend time working on music, I'd have to be really interested.

2894
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:17,550
Vinny, did you do that?

2895
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,329
I don't fucking understand.

2896
01:46:30,449 --> 01:46:31,090
What's going on?

2897
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:34,859
What the fuck?

2898
01:46:35,579 --> 01:46:54,960
Oops.

2899
01:47:04,609 --> 01:47:05,170
Oh shit.

2900
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:29,649
Where am I?

2901
01:47:42,659 --> 01:47:43,539
Okay, there's somebody with you.

2902
01:47:43,539 --> 01:47:43,859
All right.

2903
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:48,829
I am currently with Charborg and I just saw Jolly go down through admin.

2904
01:47:48,829 --> 01:47:54,029
Protect me while I do my task.

2905
01:47:54,029 --> 01:47:54,750
What's your task?

2906
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:57,920
I have to go in here and flip this lever.

2907
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,720
You do.

2908
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,279
Interesting.

2909
01:48:00,619 --> 01:48:01,180
Go and do it.

2910
01:48:06,739 --> 01:48:07,380
Thanks.

2911
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:07,859
You're welcome.

2912
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:14,029
I don't know because we're alone together and I don't, I don't know you.

2913
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,310
I don't know you, man.

2914
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:16,029
I don't know you.

2915
01:48:16,029 --> 01:48:16,670
I don't know you.

2916
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:17,390
I'm chill.

2917
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:18,109
I don't know you.

2918
01:48:18,109 --> 01:48:21,390
All right, stay away, stay at least five feet away from me.

2919
01:48:23,409 --> 01:48:23,810
Damn it.

2920
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:24,210
I knew it.

2921
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:35,710
I knew it too.

2922
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:36,350
I knew it.

2923
01:48:39,489 --> 01:48:39,810
Wow.

2924
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:55,140
Hey, am I like we get loud when I scream?

2925
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:58,260
I hope not because like I didn't do like a noise gate today.

2926
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,859
I hope I'm not like screaming in your ears.

2927
01:49:02,979 --> 01:49:03,380
Okay, good.

2928
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:05,180
Sorry.

2929
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:07,260
Oh, I knew it was Charborg.

2930
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:09,180
I was going to call the meeting next time we had the chance.

2931
01:49:09,819 --> 01:49:11,100
Yeah, I just lied.

2932
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,020
It's scary.

2933
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:16,220
It's so funny because you were like, oh, I'm just doing my task and there's

2934
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:19,500
nothing to do in that room and I was like, wait, didn't that, I don't get it.

2935
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,819
And he looked at the screen for like one second and turned around

2936
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:23,180
I pretended to do it.

2937
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:25,979
I pushed a couple imaginary buttons.

2938
01:49:25,979 --> 01:49:26,699
I was like, that's like that.

2939
01:49:26,699 --> 01:49:26,939
I don't know.

2940
01:49:26,939 --> 01:49:28,220
Is that even accurate?

2941
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:29,020
Four out of five.

2942
01:49:30,699 --> 01:49:31,979
I was hitting the buttons.

2943
01:49:31,979 --> 01:49:33,420
I hit four out of five buttons.

2944
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:35,260
It was zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

2945
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:36,699
I hit zero, zero, zero, zero.

2946
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:40,380
I cost us the game.

2947
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,420
How long have we been playing for?

2948
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,979
I feel like time flies when you're the imposter.

2949
01:49:43,979 --> 01:49:46,460
Yeah, I think it's been an hour and 50.

2950
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:46,960
Cool.

2951
01:49:47,819 --> 01:49:48,539
It's not too much.

2952
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,659
We're still missing some people too.

2953
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,260
It's eight out of 10.

2954
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:59,260
I think we're missing Zam and...

2955
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,460
Are we missing people?

2956
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:05,140
Yeah, Zam's headset died and obviously Coney...

2957
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:11,840
What?

2958
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:13,180
Why does that keep happening?

2959
01:50:13,819 --> 01:50:18,720
Because an imposter is making it happen.

2960
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,760
We got to fix it.

2961
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,800
Otherwise we die.

2962
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,300
Oh, okay.

2963
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:26,479
That's the instant win button, basically.

2964
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:28,239
Wait, instant win.

2965
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:29,279
So if that ghost is...

2966
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:29,920
What do you mean?

2967
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,920
If you don't fix those things like we didn't before, they just win.

2968
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:35,439
You're not going to kill me, right?

2969
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:38,640
I'm looking for another person so we're not alone together.

2970
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,199
Are you doing your tasks, Jerma?

2971
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,880
I don't know what...

2972
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,960
By the way, get out of here, you imposter.

2973
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,079
Just fucking got you, you sus guy.

2974
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:50,880
Got you, motherfucker.

2975
01:50:58,689 --> 01:50:59,189
Who died?

2976
01:51:04,130 --> 01:51:04,630
I saw...

2977
01:51:07,409 --> 01:51:08,289
I turned the corner.

2978
01:51:08,289 --> 01:51:09,329
I was standing in the hallway.

2979
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:10,449
I saw Jerma go like this.

2980
01:51:10,449 --> 01:51:11,729
I'm going to do a representation.

2981
01:51:11,729 --> 01:51:12,770
A reenactment.

2982
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:13,569
A reenactment?

2983
01:51:15,409 --> 01:51:16,210
And he killed someone.

2984
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:19,010
What am I, Elmer Fudd?

2985
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:21,649
I did see him run away from the body.

2986
01:51:21,649 --> 01:51:22,770
Fucking porcupine.

2987
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:23,569
Run away from the body.

2988
01:51:27,329 --> 01:51:28,689
You did run away from the body.

2989
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:29,329
I saw it.

2990
01:51:29,329 --> 01:51:30,289
You ran right into me.

2991
01:51:30,289 --> 01:51:31,569
I didn't see a body.

2992
01:51:32,369 --> 01:51:34,529
I was hoping you would call me to check if I could be like this.

2993
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:36,930
In what room?

2994
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:38,689
I have insane tunnel vision right now.

2995
01:51:38,689 --> 01:51:39,649
I don't know how to play the game.

2996
01:51:40,609 --> 01:51:41,729
Oh, he doesn't know how to play the game.

2997
01:51:41,729 --> 01:51:42,529
It's been an hour and a half.

2998
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:46,210
I just had to ask Vinny.

2999
01:51:46,210 --> 01:51:48,770
I just had to ask Vinny before his untimely death.

3000
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:49,649
Oh, the dead body?

3001
01:51:56,369 --> 01:51:57,489
You can't get rid of me.

3002
01:51:57,489 --> 01:51:58,289
You can't get rid of me.

3003
01:51:58,289 --> 01:51:59,250
I'm holding on.

3004
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:00,210
You can't get rid of me.

3005
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:03,010
You can't get rid of me.

3006
01:52:04,289 --> 01:52:05,250
I'm not going.

3007
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:06,210
I'm not fucking going.

3008
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:07,329
He doesn't even see a body.

3009
01:52:07,329 --> 01:52:08,130
He doesn't even see him.

3010
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:08,689
I ain't going.

3011
01:52:08,689 --> 01:52:09,250
I'm not letting go.

3012
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:10,689
You're going to fucking kill me yourselves.

3013
01:52:11,489 --> 01:52:12,210
Get him out of here.

3014
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:13,090
Because I'm not letting go.

3015
01:52:15,649 --> 01:52:16,289
Hey, guys.

3016
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:17,890
That sounds funny.

3017
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:18,850
OK, so let's skip the vote.

3018
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:19,729
Who knows who it was?

3019
01:52:19,729 --> 01:52:20,689
We don't have any idea.

3020
01:52:20,689 --> 01:52:21,649
Look at anybody.

3021
01:52:23,409 --> 01:52:24,449
I think we should skip.

3022
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:26,930
Fuck this cake.

3023
01:52:28,449 --> 01:52:29,569
I don't even want it anymore.

3024
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:32,210
My fucking fifth birthday party was ruined.

3025
01:52:33,729 --> 01:52:41,859
Hey, how are you?

3026
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:45,550
I'm not good at this.

3027
01:52:46,350 --> 01:52:51,409
Did I do good?

3028
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:00,850
I did hit the ball.

3029
01:53:01,579 --> 01:53:03,100
I hit a dribbler back to the pitcher

3030
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:04,619
and I forgot to run to first base.

3031
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:09,439
Oh, we have task, right?

3032
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:14,060
Oh, I was talking to Vinny.

3033
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:15,420
Like, what an idiot.

3034
01:53:16,909 --> 01:53:17,630
I can't do.

3035
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:20,510
Oh, I was talking to Vinny right before he died.

3036
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:22,800
I deserve that.

3037
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,359
I swear to God, I swear to God.

3038
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:27,600
Did you hear my explanation of what happened?

3039
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:30,880
No, but what I did hear was you,

3040
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,920
as you were stabbing me,

3041
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,279
you were saying really bizarre,

3042
01:53:33,279 --> 01:53:35,199
like demented, like serial killer shit.

3043
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:35,920
So that was cool.

3044
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,260
What was your explanation, Jerma?

3045
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:43,380
They asked, I mentioned how I had just talked to you.

3046
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:44,819
I was like, oh, when I just talked to him

3047
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:46,020
and they were like, what do you mean just talk to him?

3048
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:47,539
Like, you were in the room with him.

3049
01:53:48,859 --> 01:53:50,220
I was the only one in the room with you.

3050
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:53,439
That's like when I said I walked past your corpse

3051
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:54,720
when I first started playing the game.

3052
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,479
It's not a good strat.

3053
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:01,899
Oh, he got him.

3054
01:54:04,529 --> 01:54:06,130
Yeah, I got killed.

3055
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:11,340
You know, I try my best to defend myself

3056
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:12,619
by screaming as loud as I could,

3057
01:54:12,619 --> 01:54:14,539
but it didn't work out in the end.

3058
01:54:14,539 --> 01:54:16,220
Oh man, this is funny.

3059
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,100
Sorry to hear that.

3060
01:54:17,819 --> 01:54:21,920
I will say your meat bone is particularly strong.

3061
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:22,640
Look at this thing.

3062
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:23,840
Oh my God.

3063
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,039
Wait, I can see myself.

3064
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:26,560
Wait, I'm going to pull myself back together.

3065
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,199
Do you kidding me?

3066
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:29,520
This is a marketing scheme here.

3067
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,039
How have they not done this?

3068
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:32,560
Popsicle with the bone.

3069
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,119
The bone's the stick and it's an Among Us character.

3070
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,199
I would not want anybody.

3071
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:40,560
I wouldn't want to see people eating that.

3072
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:41,840
That would gross me out.

3073
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:44,880
You know, like at the Boardwalk in New Jersey,

3074
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,720
they sell bootleg Amoguses.

3075
01:54:47,359 --> 01:54:50,399
It's real Amogus, but it's bootleg companies

3076
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:51,920
that probably don't have the rights to sell them.

3077
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,800
Jerma, we could sell the Popsicles.

3078
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:56,079
Could we?

3079
01:54:57,649 --> 01:54:59,010
I don't think we can.

3080
01:54:59,010 --> 01:54:59,970
What do you mean, like lift up?

3081
01:54:59,970 --> 01:55:00,529
It's just a shape.

3082
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:02,930
It would just be clean with a bone.

3083
01:55:03,569 --> 01:55:06,289
Yeah, you should actually get like a ham,

3084
01:55:06,289 --> 01:55:08,930
like a big ham leg with a bone sticking out

3085
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:10,689
and just carve it to look like an Among Us.

3086
01:55:11,329 --> 01:55:13,010
That way, it's like a little more immersive.

3087
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:27,409
Do they have any idea?

3088
01:55:46,029 --> 01:55:48,750
I said the impression that you did earlier,

3089
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,750
but that was so goddamn funny.

3090
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:51,229
Would it be you?

3091
01:55:51,229 --> 01:55:51,710
Which one?

3092
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:52,270
Jerma?

3093
01:55:52,270 --> 01:55:56,750
Oh, I was with Crockett until we were trying to do O2.

3094
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:58,430
Wait, where was the body again?

3095
01:55:58,430 --> 01:55:59,710
He walked by me like this and he was like,

3096
01:55:59,949 --> 01:56:00,189
Who'd have it?

3097
01:56:00,189 --> 01:56:00,270
Who'd have it?

3098
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:00,350
Who'd have it?

3099
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:00,430
Who'd have it?

3100
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:00,510
Who'd have it?

3101
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:00,670
Who'd have it?

3102
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:00,829
Who'd have it?

3103
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:00,909
Who'd have it?

3104
01:56:00,909 --> 01:56:00,989
Who'd have it?

3105
01:56:00,989 --> 01:56:01,069
Who'd have it?

3106
01:56:01,069 --> 01:56:01,149
Who'd have it?

3107
01:56:01,149 --> 01:56:01,229
Who'd have it?

3108
01:56:01,229 --> 01:56:01,310
Who'd have it?

3109
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:01,390
Who'd have it?

3110
01:56:01,390 --> 01:56:01,470
Who'd have it?

3111
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:01,550
Who'd have it?

3112
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:01,630
Who'd have it?

3113
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:01,710
Who'd have it?

3114
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:01,789
Who'd have it?

3115
01:56:01,789 --> 01:56:01,869
Who'd have it?

3116
01:56:01,869 --> 01:56:01,949
Who'd have it?

3117
01:56:01,949 --> 01:56:02,029
Who'd have it?

3118
01:56:02,029 --> 01:56:02,109
Who'd have it?

3119
01:56:02,109 --> 01:56:02,189
Who'd have it?

3120
01:56:02,189 --> 01:56:02,270
Who'd have it?

3121
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:02,350
Who'd have it?

3122
01:56:02,350 --> 01:56:02,430
Who'd have it?

3123
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:02,510
Who'd have it?

3124
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:02,590
Who'd have it?

3125
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:02,670
Who'd have it?

3126
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:02,750
Who'd have it?

3127
01:56:03,470 --> 01:56:04,029
Other ghosts.

3128
01:56:04,029 --> 01:56:05,949
Sorry, I did a porky to take impression.

3129
01:56:05,949 --> 01:56:06,590
That was perfect.

3130
01:56:07,869 --> 01:56:08,909
That could have been me talking.

3131
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:15,869
Is that Jermex as a chat member?

3132
01:56:15,869 --> 01:56:16,750
No, that's the sus guy.

3133
01:56:17,789 --> 01:56:18,829
Yeah, that's a different person today.

3134
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:37,439
Okay, okay, I'm not gonna be funny and vote on four.

3135
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:41,039
Because if we vote on four and we win, we just die.

3136
01:56:42,319 --> 01:56:45,039
This is not a little funny social game.

3137
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:45,760
Are they gonna vote?

3138
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,199
Who are they voting for?

3139
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:47,760
We can...

3140
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,750
Ah, yeah, yeah, let's be social.

3141
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:53,630
We don't need to use the game's features to determine...

3142
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,310
No, they're not gonna get it.

3143
01:56:56,909 --> 01:56:57,949
I can't believe it.

3144
01:56:57,949 --> 01:56:59,710
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?

3145
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:00,670
Where was the body?

3146
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:02,189
I thought we were trying to get last thing.

3147
01:57:02,189 --> 01:57:03,949
No, no, no, what was that about?

3148
01:57:04,829 --> 01:57:05,710
I can't believe this.

3149
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:08,029
Voting vacuum of space is not a good party game.

3150
01:57:08,029 --> 01:57:08,829
It's not a funny game.

3151
01:57:08,829 --> 01:57:09,470
I'm not playing...

3152
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:10,670
No, it was not a party game.

3153
01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:11,869
It was a valid tactic.

3154
01:57:11,869 --> 01:57:13,310
I was trying to make sure that we don't die.

3155
01:57:14,829 --> 01:57:15,310
I did that.

3156
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:16,109
That's funny.

3157
01:57:16,109 --> 01:57:16,989
I just pressed that.

3158
01:57:17,869 --> 01:57:18,430
I did that.

3159
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:18,909
It was me.

3160
01:57:25,729 --> 01:57:26,289
Finally.

3161
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:32,189
Oh, the official sussicle.

3162
01:57:43,579 --> 01:57:44,859
Oh, this verse is dead.

3163
01:57:48,909 --> 01:57:53,229
So if somebody dies here, can they see who even does it?

3164
01:57:53,229 --> 01:57:55,789
Or could it be anybody in this, you know, five feet of each other?

3165
01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:57,890
If he kills right now,

3166
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:59,890
would it be like somebody in the room or would they see it?

3167
01:58:04,930 --> 01:58:05,649
They can't see.

3168
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:07,329
Oh, they can, they can, they can.

3169
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:13,729
Tick tock.

3170
01:58:14,449 --> 01:58:15,569
Here comes the reactor.

3171
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:26,020
Oh, he's...

3172
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:26,340
Yep.

3173
01:58:26,979 --> 01:58:27,300
Yep.

3174
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:27,859
He knows it.

3175
01:58:28,659 --> 01:58:29,220
He knows it.

3176
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:35,390
Oh, that's tricky.

3177
01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:36,189
He's a tricky...

3178
01:58:36,189 --> 01:58:37,149
He's a tricky motherfucker.

3179
01:58:37,149 --> 01:58:37,710
He really is.

3180
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:39,229
I feel sorry for him right now.

3181
01:58:39,229 --> 01:58:41,069
Yeah, there's still a lot of tasks to do, too.

3182
01:58:41,069 --> 01:58:41,710
This is scary.

3183
01:58:42,989 --> 01:58:44,510
If you want to be the...

3184
01:58:44,510 --> 01:58:46,350
If you're the person, I'll give you...

3185
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:47,470
I'll give you it now, right now.

3186
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:49,229
If you're the killer, I'm gonna hide in the corner.

3187
01:58:49,869 --> 01:58:51,229
I'm gonna hide in the corner.

3188
01:58:51,229 --> 01:58:51,630
Let's make it...

3189
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:52,510
Oh, no.

3190
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:53,470
Yeah, this is bad.

3191
01:58:53,470 --> 01:58:54,109
This is gonna end up...

3192
01:58:54,109 --> 01:58:54,670
All right, go ahead.

3193
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:57,149
If you're the person, you'll never find me here.

3194
01:58:57,149 --> 01:58:57,949
You'll never find me here.

3195
01:58:57,949 --> 01:58:58,829
Kill me.

3196
01:58:58,829 --> 01:58:59,949
Oh, no, no, no.

3197
01:58:59,949 --> 01:59:00,989
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.

3198
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:02,829
Oh, well, I guess they found us here.

3199
01:59:04,029 --> 01:59:04,590
Hey, what's up?

3200
01:59:05,550 --> 01:59:06,189
Uh, I'm gonna...

3201
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:09,310
I was trying to give...

3202
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:09,810
Okay.

3203
01:59:13,699 --> 01:59:14,500
Who's doing this?

3204
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:16,819
Oh, well, I guess...

3205
01:59:16,819 --> 01:59:19,300
He's being so obvious.

3206
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:20,100
Who's doing this?

3207
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:21,380
Yeah, it's Jerma.

3208
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:22,100
It's Jerma?

3209
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:23,380
Jerma's dead.

3210
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:24,420
He was the other imposter.

3211
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:26,500
I'm just pressing buttons, man.

3212
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:29,840
I'm sticking around back here, though.

3213
01:59:32,369 --> 01:59:33,329
Oh, you catch up.

3214
01:59:33,329 --> 01:59:34,449
You can get that kill right there

3215
01:59:34,449 --> 01:59:35,170
and turn around and run.

3216
01:59:51,779 --> 01:59:53,300
What's the strategy here, by the way?

3217
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:54,739
My streams, that's pretty awesome.

3218
02:00:09,329 --> 02:00:11,090
Okay, now they're splitting up.

3219
02:00:12,449 --> 02:00:13,489
Oh, this is it right here.

3220
02:00:14,289 --> 02:00:15,250
This is it right here.

3221
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:15,890
You can do it right now.

3222
02:00:22,289 --> 02:00:23,729
I think he's doing the long con.

3223
02:00:23,729 --> 02:00:24,449
He's doing the vote.

3224
02:00:24,449 --> 02:00:25,409
He's trying to vote her.

3225
02:00:25,409 --> 02:00:25,909
Oh.

3226
02:00:33,630 --> 02:00:34,829
Oh, it's diabolical.

3227
02:00:34,829 --> 02:00:35,789
Wait, did you shut that?

3228
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:37,310
Did I?

3229
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:38,109
No, I don't think so.

3230
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:40,479
Can I do that?

3231
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:43,569
I think you do it through the map.

3232
02:00:43,569 --> 02:00:44,210
Oh, I can do it.

3233
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:45,970
Jolly, Jolly, I will tell you,

3234
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:47,569
your audio is a little bit low.

3235
02:00:47,569 --> 02:00:48,930
You're very soft spoken.

3236
02:00:48,930 --> 02:00:51,329
And I think maybe if you had a little bit more volumage,

3237
02:00:51,329 --> 02:00:51,970
I would have heard you.

3238
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:58,529
All right.

3239
02:00:58,689 --> 02:00:59,329
No, I did.

3240
02:00:59,329 --> 02:01:00,770
Hey, there's someone on the other side.

3241
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:02,050
I thought you were doing it.

3242
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:02,770
There's someone here.

3243
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:05,699
Who's in there?

3244
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:06,180
It's a name.

3245
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:06,659
It's me.

3246
02:01:06,659 --> 02:01:07,460
I see Robbo live.

3247
02:01:08,819 --> 02:01:09,060
Great.

3248
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:09,380
You're cool.

3249
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:09,699
You're cool.

3250
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:11,779
Hello.

3251
02:01:11,779 --> 02:01:12,739
This is getting out of hand, man.

3252
02:01:12,739 --> 02:01:13,220
I won.

3253
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:14,420
I had to give them a chance.

3254
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:15,539
I'm like, I'm going to separate.

3255
02:01:15,539 --> 02:01:16,100
Oh, yeah.

3256
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:17,140
Okay, I'll be with you.

3257
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:17,859
I'll be with you.

3258
02:01:17,859 --> 02:01:19,539
Oh, boy.

3259
02:01:19,539 --> 02:01:20,640
Oh, boy.

3260
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:22,800
No, this is the end here.

3261
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,680
Can they solve it?

3262
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:24,560
This is the end right here.

3263
02:01:27,170 --> 02:01:27,970
No, God.

3264
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:29,329
I think it's because we can't throw our health pack.

3265
02:01:29,329 --> 02:01:30,689
Is it open when we go through?

3266
02:01:31,649 --> 02:01:32,130
Where did he go?

3267
02:01:33,810 --> 02:01:35,010
He's right there.

3268
02:01:42,689 --> 02:01:43,489
Oh, that's it.

3269
02:01:44,609 --> 02:01:45,329
Emergency meeting.

3270
02:01:45,329 --> 02:01:45,810
That's game.

3271
02:01:46,449 --> 02:01:46,930
That's game.

3272
02:01:47,970 --> 02:01:48,529
Yeah, that has a bit.

3273
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:01,439
I was like, just kill me so that way it can be interesting.

3274
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:05,359
I love that you put yourself in such an impossible-to-find spot,

3275
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:06,960
and then they both just walked in.

3276
02:02:21,939 --> 02:02:22,579
He's very good.

3277
02:02:22,579 --> 02:02:23,699
He's very methodical.

3278
02:02:23,699 --> 02:02:24,579
He's very methodical.

3279
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:34,180
Drinking our beers, looking at them play.

3280
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:34,420
Yeah.

3281
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:37,699
Do I look like I know for the JPEGs?

3282
02:02:37,699 --> 02:02:40,180
Oh, I mean, I think Liam may have done it.

3283
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:43,140
I think Liam may have done it.

3284
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:43,699
I'm not sure.

3285
02:02:44,739 --> 02:02:46,340
I have a narrow urethra.

3286
02:02:46,340 --> 02:02:46,840
Liam!

3287
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:57,140
I mean, I have.

3288
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:59,300
He's got orange and cake over him.

3289
02:02:59,300 --> 02:02:59,800
Oh, thank you.

3290
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:02,979
There we go.

3291
02:03:02,979 --> 02:03:03,460
There we go.

3292
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:03,939
Sorry.

3293
02:03:03,939 --> 02:03:04,739
That was a good one.

3294
02:03:04,739 --> 02:03:05,939
You did it, buddy.

3295
02:03:05,939 --> 02:03:08,739
That was the most stressed I've ever been in my entire life.

3296
02:03:08,739 --> 02:03:10,579
That was, like, really close.

3297
02:03:10,579 --> 02:03:11,060
Good job.

3298
02:03:12,909 --> 02:03:13,470
There we go.

3299
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:14,750
I chose the wrong person to kill.

3300
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:16,590
I definitely chose the wrong person to kill.

3301
02:03:17,869 --> 02:03:19,949
But then again, you two were together the whole time.

3302
02:03:19,949 --> 02:03:21,789
It was impossible for me to get rid of anybody else.

3303
02:03:21,789 --> 02:03:25,069
I was like, I'm just going to break away from the group to give it to you.

3304
02:03:25,069 --> 02:03:26,270
Yeah, I know it could have been you.

3305
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:27,710
Yeah, oh god, no.

3306
02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:30,750
I should have went for you as soon as I had the chance.

3307
02:03:31,069 --> 02:03:34,029
Oh, that was such a good game.

3308
02:03:34,029 --> 02:03:35,630
That was actually a good game.

3309
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:36,350
Thank you for the sabotages.

3310
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:37,310
That was really helpful.

3311
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:37,789
Yeah.

3312
02:03:37,789 --> 02:03:38,829
I was pressing buttons.

3313
02:03:38,829 --> 02:03:39,710
I was pressing buttons for you.

3314
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:40,270
You were, yeah.

3315
02:03:41,069 --> 02:03:43,229
Let me just check and see if anyone's rejoining.

3316
02:03:43,229 --> 02:03:46,000
I'm a part of a wide network.

3317
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:46,479
Yeah.

3318
02:03:46,479 --> 02:03:47,520
Oh, we got someone back.

3319
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,880
I have a portable charger hooked up to my headset now.

3320
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:51,680
Oh, hell yeah.

3321
02:03:52,399 --> 02:03:53,600
Welcome back, shit.

3322
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,159
What headset are you in?

3323
02:03:54,159 --> 02:03:55,199
You played a great game, Liam.

3324
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:56,880
That was, like, fantastically good.

3325
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,479
You kept us guessing until the very last second.

3326
02:03:58,479 --> 02:03:59,279
That was great.

3327
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:01,920
Yeah, I was like, OK, if we're all moving together,

3328
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,680
it's a four-person unit, it's not fun.

3329
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:05,600
I'm bad at this game, so that means it's still a nine.

3330
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:07,359
I wanted to step away and be like, all right,

3331
02:04:07,359 --> 02:04:10,479
if you kill me, it's going to get real funny real fast.

3332
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:12,000
Damn it.

3333
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,039
My chat likes you a lot.

3334
02:04:13,039 --> 02:04:14,399
It was so, no, you were there.

3335
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:16,319
You were together, and then the bite was calling.

3336
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:18,399
It was like, if he's there, it's definitely you.

3337
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:18,960
It was like, ah!

3338
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:19,760
That was so funny.

3339
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:20,399
Yeah, I love that.

3340
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:21,359
I saw both of you guys.

3341
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:25,279
That just tasted like a rubber tire.

3342
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:25,920
That was weird.

3343
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,439
Probably not a reason to do that.

3344
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:30,079
That was a good game.

3345
02:04:30,079 --> 02:04:31,920
It was a great Among Us game, guys.

3346
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:34,960
Some games of Among Us, thumbs up, thumbs up.

3347
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,880
Some great, high quality Among Us games happening.

3348
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:39,119
Wait, are we doing another one?

3349
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:39,680
Are we all done?

3350
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:40,000
Yeah.

3351
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,520
Yeah, I want to do a couple more.

3352
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:42,000
OK.

3353
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,680
How do you turn that option off, chat member?

3354
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:44,720
This game is really good.

3355
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:46,239
I actually played this game in VR.

3356
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:47,760
Hey, you guys want to break it in one of these?

3357
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:48,640
Yes, yes!

3358
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:49,840
I'm down to play more.

3359
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:54,000
My chat said something like, if you could turn the option off

3360
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,159
so that dead people don't know who the imposter is,

3361
02:04:57,359 --> 02:04:59,359
like, you have no idea how to edit that.

3362
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:00,399
It's in the lobby.

3363
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:02,800
Tools, I guess.

3364
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:03,520
Lobby options.

3365
02:05:05,119 --> 02:05:07,119
Probably under match, whoever's hosting.

3366
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:07,760
Who's in here?

3367
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:10,640
In match, it just says leave game.

3368
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:11,760
There's a Big Dipper.

3369
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,319
Oh, OK.

3370
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:12,880
What a wonderful view.

3371
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,239
There actually is a constellation over here.

3372
02:05:14,239 --> 02:05:14,960
What is that?

3373
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,600
Oh, is there?

3374
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,960
You have to be the lobby leader.

3375
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:17,600
All right, never mind.

3376
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,159
Oh, there is!

3377
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:19,680
I know, it's one for real.

3378
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:20,319
Hey, hey, hey.

3379
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:20,800
OK.

3380
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,039
I think that might be the red imposter.

3381
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:23,600
You know what I'm saying?

3382
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,560
That might be the red imposter.

3383
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,760
What is Robert E. imposter?

3384
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:26,560
Goster.

3385
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:27,680
I think that's Goster Moe.

3386
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,159
Yes.

3387
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:31,920
Someone in my chat said I'm surprised he's not playing with Jerma.

3388
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,279
What is it?

3389
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:37,279
Someone in my chat just said I'm surprised he's not playing with Jerma.

3390
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:39,520
That is surprising.

3391
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:41,439
I mean, who's this guy?

3392
02:05:42,159 --> 02:05:43,520
No, he's not feeling that well.

3393
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:45,039
Yeah.

3394
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:46,640
Yeah, he's not feeling good, chat member.

3395
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:48,159
He's a little under the weather.

3396
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,880
Yo, it's been cruder every time.

3397
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:54,319
Every time.

3398
02:05:54,319 --> 02:05:58,880
All right, guys, I think there's an imposter on my list.

3399
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,039
I'm just going to go this way.

3400
02:06:08,220 --> 02:06:09,659
You, that was weird.

3401
02:06:09,659 --> 02:06:10,619
You creeped up on me.

3402
02:06:10,619 --> 02:06:12,140
And I'm about to fucking do an emergency meeting.

3403
02:06:12,699 --> 02:06:14,770
I'm about to do an emergency meeting.

3404
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:15,569
I'm telling you right now.

3405
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:18,289
You step any closer, I'm going to press it.

3406
02:06:19,729 --> 02:06:21,329
You step any closer, I'm going to press this button.

3407
02:06:21,890 --> 02:06:23,060
I'm just being honest.

3408
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:25,020
God damn it!

3409
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:25,579
Did I get it?

3410
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:27,500
Did I get it?

3411
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:27,979
Did I press it?

3412
02:06:27,979 --> 02:06:28,460
Did I get it?

3413
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:30,140
What happened, Jerma?

3414
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:31,260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3415
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:33,500
Don't let him talk first because he's going to sound much smarter than me

3416
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:34,460
and it's going to fuck everything up.

3417
02:06:34,699 --> 02:06:35,899
Don't let him talk.

3418
02:06:35,899 --> 02:06:37,659
No, no, no, seriously.

3419
02:06:38,539 --> 02:06:39,420
You were in the room with me.

3420
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:40,220
All right, go ahead, go ahead.

3421
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:40,859
Hold on a minute.

3422
02:06:40,859 --> 02:06:41,819
Jolly, what were you doing?

3423
02:06:41,819 --> 02:06:43,819
Why didn't you leave?

3424
02:06:43,819 --> 02:06:45,500
You were in the room and you were in the room.

3425
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:46,699
I need everyone to listen, please.

3426
02:06:47,979 --> 02:06:49,659
You were in the room and you were in the room.

3427
02:06:49,659 --> 02:06:52,060
And I walked this way and there was...

3428
02:06:52,779 --> 02:06:54,619
I turned around, crank and jump scared me.

3429
02:06:54,619 --> 02:06:55,340
Okay, Jolly.

3430
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,060
No one's listening.

3431
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:57,579
I'm listening.

3432
02:06:57,579 --> 02:06:58,079
Okay.

3433
02:06:58,079 --> 02:06:58,859
You know what?

3434
02:06:58,859 --> 02:06:59,819
You're not listening.

3435
02:07:01,579 --> 02:07:03,020
We're looking directly at you.

3436
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:04,460
Okay, all right, okay, okay.

3437
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:05,579
It's my birthday, everyone quiet.

3438
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:10,619
So, by the way, can I just say...

3439
02:07:11,899 --> 02:07:13,260
No, this is...

3440
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:16,859
No, no, we have 47 seconds.

3441
02:07:16,859 --> 02:07:18,220
There's only 40 seconds.

3442
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:26,859
Thank you.

3443
02:07:26,859 --> 02:07:27,659
Yay!

3444
02:07:27,659 --> 02:07:28,380
Okay, thank you.

3445
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:33,739
Hey, I gotta make my wish.

3446
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:35,260
I gotta make my wish.

3447
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:38,859
No, I gotta make a wish.

3448
02:07:38,859 --> 02:07:41,579
So, my wish is Criken followed me and he was behind me.

3449
02:07:42,779 --> 02:07:43,979
No, stop singing.

3450
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:47,420
No, stop talking.

3451
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:47,979
Stop it.

3452
02:07:47,979 --> 02:07:49,340
It's my birthday.

3453
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:50,140
It's my birthday.

3454
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:53,420
My underwear just came down.

3455
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:54,939
I think my underwear just fell off.

3456
02:07:54,939 --> 02:07:55,659
Okay, listen.

3457
02:07:57,180 --> 02:07:58,619
My underwear came down.

3458
02:07:58,619 --> 02:07:59,020
Listen.

3459
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:01,180
Stop.

3460
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:02,300
Criken followed me.

3461
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:03,659
I can't even explain what happened.

3462
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:07,260
Criken, Criken, Criken, Criken, Criken.

3463
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:08,619
No, no, what have you done?

3464
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:14,100
Press it again, press it again.

3465
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:16,819
Everyone calm down.

3466
02:08:16,819 --> 02:08:17,539
Please press it again.

3467
02:08:17,539 --> 02:08:18,899
Press this fucking button again.

3468
02:08:18,899 --> 02:08:20,500
Don't press it, don't press it.

3469
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:21,539
What do you mean, your underwear?

3470
02:08:21,539 --> 02:08:22,659
Oh, God, we can't press it.

3471
02:08:22,659 --> 02:08:23,380
We got a picture.

3472
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:24,500
He's him.

3473
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:25,460
Everybody follow Criken.

3474
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:26,100
I'm not kidding.

3475
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:26,739
It was Criken.

3476
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:28,739
I'm telling you.

3477
02:08:28,739 --> 02:08:29,779
The one you've done had...

3478
02:08:29,779 --> 02:08:32,979
The one you've done I think is the funniest fucking audio bite.

3479
02:08:32,979 --> 02:08:34,100
I'm telling you right now.

3480
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:35,140
Criken followed me.

3481
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:36,420
And you guys are saying about a great work.

3482
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:36,979
I fixed it.

3483
02:08:36,979 --> 02:08:38,100
We all sent me pictures.

3484
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:38,899
We all sent me pictures.

3485
02:08:38,899 --> 02:08:40,180
I did, I did, I did.

3486
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:41,220
I did see him fixing.

3487
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:41,699
Oh, my God.

3488
02:08:41,699 --> 02:08:42,100
Are you happy?

3489
02:08:42,819 --> 02:08:46,220
What's going on?

3490
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:48,430
Is that a no or...

3491
02:08:49,069 --> 02:08:49,949
Got my eye on you.

3492
02:08:51,649 --> 02:08:52,210
I can see that.

3493
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:55,979
Now, if you don't mind, I got some tasks to do, okay?

3494
02:08:55,979 --> 02:08:57,180
Somebody follow him.

3495
02:08:57,180 --> 02:08:58,220
I got some tasks to do.

3496
02:08:58,220 --> 02:08:58,720
All right.

3497
02:08:59,659 --> 02:09:01,500
You know, I also got some tasks to do.

3498
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:02,380
I think I'm gonna do them.

3499
02:09:05,739 --> 02:09:07,100
Oh, we're doing funny noises, cool.

3500
02:09:08,539 --> 02:09:09,180
Ah, that's fun.

3501
02:09:09,819 --> 02:09:10,939
That's not what that sound one's...

3502
02:09:10,939 --> 02:09:12,060
That doesn't sound like that one.

3503
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:12,779
That doesn't sound like that one.

3504
02:09:12,779 --> 02:09:13,659
He's faking it.

3505
02:09:13,659 --> 02:09:14,300
Oh, my God.

3506
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:15,100
It's a fake sound.

3507
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:15,899
You're doing a fake sound.

3508
02:09:15,899 --> 02:09:18,539
I'm singing Happy Birthday when you press an emergency meeting next time.

3509
02:09:18,539 --> 02:09:19,260
I'm doing a real sound.

3510
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:19,819
Damn.

3511
02:09:19,819 --> 02:09:21,020
I'm doing a real sound.

3512
02:09:21,579 --> 02:09:22,460
Hey, hey, hey.

3513
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,420
Wait, what?

3514
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:24,460
Oh, that's impossible.

3515
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:24,939
That's a no.

3516
02:09:24,939 --> 02:09:25,500
It's green.

3517
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:25,979
It's green.

3518
02:09:26,939 --> 02:09:27,819
Wait, what happened?

3519
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:29,600
You.

3520
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:31,020
This green.

3521
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:32,140
This green right here.

3522
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:33,260
This green right here.

3523
02:09:34,539 --> 02:09:35,420
I didn't see that.

3524
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:37,180
I turned around and I just saw you.

3525
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:39,100
We have two dead guys.

3526
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:40,300
Why did he do that to me?

3527
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:41,340
We have two dead.

3528
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,460
Why did he do that?

3529
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:43,020
Oh, Jesus.

3530
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:43,899
Wait, you weren't there.

3531
02:09:43,899 --> 02:09:46,060
I just see you like looking like somewhere else.

3532
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:46,939
Or was that you?

3533
02:09:46,939 --> 02:09:47,659
No, it was me.

3534
02:09:47,659 --> 02:09:48,539
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3535
02:09:48,539 --> 02:09:49,420
I was in the little levers.

3536
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:49,979
No, listen.

3537
02:09:49,979 --> 02:09:50,939
I don't know who to believe.

3538
02:09:50,939 --> 02:09:52,140
I didn't see anyone.

3539
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:52,539
Why are we?

3540
02:09:52,539 --> 02:09:53,739
I didn't see that.

3541
02:09:53,739 --> 02:09:59,420
Happy birthday to you.

3542
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:00,300
No, it's not my birthday.

3543
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:00,939
It's your birthday.

3544
02:10:00,939 --> 02:10:02,060
Is it your birthday?

3545
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:02,939
It's not my birthday.

3546
02:10:02,939 --> 02:10:05,100
No, it has to be him.

3547
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:06,460
Silence in the lobby.

3548
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:07,739
Silence in the lobby.

3549
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:08,779
Silence in the lobby.

3550
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:10,220
Silence in the lobby.

3551
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:11,340
This has to be a room.

3552
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:12,380
Silence in the lobby.

3553
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,239
It was it was just Charbork.

3554
02:10:18,239 --> 02:10:18,960
It was Charbork.

3555
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,279
Like literally like straight up.

3556
02:10:21,279 --> 02:10:22,000
Not even joking.

3557
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:23,439
Look at that.

3558
02:10:23,439 --> 02:10:24,000
I trust you.

3559
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:25,439
Implicitly.

3560
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:26,560
Seriously.

3561
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:28,109
A hundred percent.

3562
02:10:28,109 --> 02:10:28,430
Okay.

3563
02:10:29,229 --> 02:10:30,189
He turned.

3564
02:10:30,189 --> 02:10:33,149
He turned after killing and it was so obvious.

3565
02:10:38,350 --> 02:10:39,789
Someone is dead on a birthday.

3566
02:10:39,789 --> 02:10:41,390
I it has to be either.

3567
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:42,909
It has to be one of you two.

3568
02:10:42,909 --> 02:10:44,109
It has to be one of you two.

3569
02:10:45,149 --> 02:10:45,869
I understand that.

3570
02:10:45,869 --> 02:10:47,550
I didn't see anything.

3571
02:10:47,550 --> 02:10:48,510
Vote for Charbork.

3572
02:10:48,510 --> 02:10:50,510
And then if it's not Charbork.

3573
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:51,949
If it's not Charbork, then it's me.

3574
02:10:51,949 --> 02:10:52,989
Then vote for me next time.

3575
02:10:52,989 --> 02:10:53,470
Then it's you.

3576
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:54,510
Then it's you.

3577
02:10:54,510 --> 02:10:55,550
Exactly.

3578
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:56,510
A hundred percent.

3579
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:58,109
Just don't vote for me.

3580
02:10:58,109 --> 02:10:59,470
I didn't do anything.

3581
02:10:59,470 --> 02:11:00,189
But you did.

3582
02:11:00,189 --> 02:11:00,989
But you did.

3583
02:11:00,989 --> 02:11:01,550
But you did.

3584
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:02,189
I didn't.

3585
02:11:03,149 --> 02:11:04,829
And on someone's birthday too.

3586
02:11:04,829 --> 02:11:06,109
I don't know who's at this point.

3587
02:11:06,109 --> 02:11:07,630
Why are we doing this?

3588
02:11:07,630 --> 02:11:08,430
I'm confused.

3589
02:11:09,310 --> 02:11:09,949
If it's not him.

3590
02:11:11,470 --> 02:11:12,029
There he goes.

3591
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:13,810
See.

3592
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:17,310
Now you can trust me.

3593
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:21,390
Now you can trust me.

3594
02:11:26,270 --> 02:11:27,229
You have to trust me.

3595
02:11:27,869 --> 02:11:29,149
And I don't know what Kraken was doing.

3596
02:11:29,149 --> 02:11:31,310
Because he was like following me in the beginning.

3597
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:32,029
And he pressed the button.

3598
02:11:32,029 --> 02:11:32,909
I didn't even press the button.

3599
02:11:38,189 --> 02:11:38,670
Weird guy.

3600
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:39,869
Weird guy up here.

3601
02:11:39,869 --> 02:11:41,470
Weird orange guy is being weird over here.

3602
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:42,109
What do you mean?

3603
02:11:42,829 --> 02:11:43,630
Orange is being weird.

3604
02:11:44,189 --> 02:11:44,909
Orange is being weird.

3605
02:11:46,579 --> 02:11:47,460
Whoever can hear me.

3606
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:48,659
Orange is being really weird.

3607
02:11:50,829 --> 02:11:51,869
Orange is at.

3608
02:11:51,869 --> 02:11:52,829
I could kill you right now.

3609
02:11:52,829 --> 02:11:53,550
I could do it right now.

3610
02:11:53,550 --> 02:11:54,270
You made me turn.

3611
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:55,149
You made me turn around.

3612
02:11:55,149 --> 02:11:56,270
I don't know which one is next.

3613
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:57,310
And the Simon says.

3614
02:11:57,310 --> 02:11:57,810
Oh.

3615
02:11:58,350 --> 02:11:59,149
Just focus.

3616
02:11:59,149 --> 02:11:59,789
Wait.

3617
02:11:59,789 --> 02:12:00,430
This one.

3618
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:00,750
Nope.

3619
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:01,710
I got it wrong.

3620
02:12:01,710 --> 02:12:02,270
Okay.

3621
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:02,909
It was down.

3622
02:12:03,949 --> 02:12:04,449
Okay.

3623
02:12:05,069 --> 02:12:05,470
Fuck.

3624
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:07,229
It's just the children's can do this.

3625
02:12:08,430 --> 02:12:09,229
Clutch up.

3626
02:12:09,229 --> 02:12:10,350
Are you kidding me?

3627
02:12:10,350 --> 02:12:10,850
What the fuck?

3628
02:12:11,810 --> 02:12:13,090
My controller died.

3629
02:12:13,090 --> 02:12:16,850
And someone killed this man behind me while I was fixing it.

3630
02:12:16,850 --> 02:12:18,050
I'm telling you right now it's orange.

3631
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:20,050
The only one I thought was a little suspicious.

3632
02:12:20,050 --> 02:12:21,409
So I got nothing.

3633
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:22,850
It can't be.

3634
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:24,529
It can't be him.

3635
02:12:24,529 --> 02:12:25,489
It can't be me.

3636
02:12:25,489 --> 02:12:25,989
No.

3637
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:31,510
I did.

3638
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:34,689
Liam you were trailing behind us.

3639
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:38,689
I know but you did this.

3640
02:12:38,689 --> 02:12:39,170
This is what you did.

3641
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:39,810
Everyone look.

3642
02:12:39,810 --> 02:12:40,529
This is what he did.

3643
02:12:40,529 --> 02:12:40,930
He went like this.

3644
02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:41,430
He went.

3645
02:12:43,649 --> 02:12:44,529
That's exactly what he did.

3646
02:12:44,529 --> 02:12:45,409
And that's fucking sus.

3647
02:12:49,970 --> 02:12:50,609
There it is.

3648
02:12:50,609 --> 02:12:51,109
Got him.

3649
02:12:52,529 --> 02:12:53,029
Got him.

3650
02:12:54,449 --> 02:12:54,949
Got him.

3651
02:12:58,449 --> 02:13:00,050
Someone has died and you're laughing.

3652
02:13:00,930 --> 02:13:01,810
Someone has died.

3653
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:07,010
Four people have died and you're laughing.

3654
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:08,930
Are you telling me a man just happens to fall like that?

3655
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:09,810
Do you realize how serious the situation is?

3656
02:13:10,609 --> 02:13:11,810
He orchestrated it.

3657
02:13:12,289 --> 02:13:13,409
It's everyone's birthday today.

3658
02:13:13,409 --> 02:13:15,810
It's five people's birthday today and you're laughing.

3659
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:17,090
Go ahead and vote for me after.

3660
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:18,130
Go ahead and vote for me after.

3661
02:13:18,130 --> 02:13:19,729
If it's not him then don't do it next time.

3662
02:13:19,729 --> 02:13:20,529
Vote for me next time.

3663
02:13:20,529 --> 02:13:21,489
Wait you know it's not you.

3664
02:13:21,489 --> 02:13:22,210
I know it's not you.

3665
02:13:22,210 --> 02:13:23,649
There's no reason to vote for you.

3666
02:13:23,649 --> 02:13:24,149
You're good.

3667
02:13:25,409 --> 02:13:27,010
You'll always be slipping Liam.

3668
02:13:27,729 --> 02:13:28,229
And...

3669
02:13:31,489 --> 02:13:32,369
Easy game.

3670
02:13:32,369 --> 02:13:32,869
Easy game.

3671
02:13:35,329 --> 02:13:36,689
It's honestly an easy game.

3672
02:13:36,689 --> 02:13:37,970
It's just that easy.

3673
02:13:37,970 --> 02:13:39,489
Charlie forgot about you.

3674
02:13:39,489 --> 02:13:39,989
Oh my god.

3675
02:13:42,529 --> 02:13:44,529
I didn't run under the bus once.

3676
02:13:45,489 --> 02:13:46,770
What was that?

3677
02:13:47,489 --> 02:13:48,050
Yeah we won.

3678
02:13:48,050 --> 02:13:49,090
I just saw someone to kill.

3679
02:13:49,090 --> 02:13:50,050
I was just fucking with you.

3680
02:13:50,050 --> 02:13:50,850
Oh it's Charlie.

3681
02:13:51,649 --> 02:13:52,609
I mean it's so easy.

3682
02:13:55,090 --> 02:13:58,449
And you pressed the button too so that's why it was like no way man.

3683
02:13:58,449 --> 02:14:01,010
You pressed it so then it's like I didn't press it.

3684
02:14:01,010 --> 02:14:02,689
And I was trying to fix it.

3685
02:14:02,689 --> 02:14:06,210
I pressed it and you immediately start like fucking monologuing about how it's not you.

3686
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:08,609
And it's like the most suspicious thing possible.

3687
02:14:09,250 --> 02:14:10,369
I'm so bad at this.

3688
02:14:12,289 --> 02:14:13,010
You know what?

3689
02:14:13,010 --> 02:14:14,930
A pretty good way of running that.

3690
02:14:14,930 --> 02:14:15,729
I guess.

3691
02:14:15,729 --> 02:14:16,770
That's a good way to go.

3692
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:17,329
I'm gonna hold on.

3693
02:14:17,329 --> 02:14:17,890
This is great.

3694
02:14:17,890 --> 02:14:18,529
No this is fun.

3695
02:14:18,529 --> 02:14:21,670
Also I said before to Zam.

3696
02:14:21,670 --> 02:14:25,350
Jerma is the trickiest innocent person I've ever fought.

3697
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:27,189
I'm tangled.

3698
02:14:27,189 --> 02:14:27,989
He really is.

3699
02:14:27,989 --> 02:14:29,590
On that note let me explain how I...

3700
02:14:29,590 --> 02:14:31,510
He's the genuine sus guy.

3701
02:14:31,510 --> 02:14:33,750
You managed to make it reality.

3702
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:35,750
Oh no.

3703
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:37,029
Because Jerma is funny.

3704
02:14:38,869 --> 02:14:41,750
Well no I mean hey when you walk like this...

3705
02:14:42,550 --> 02:14:43,430
That was so funny.

3706
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:45,670
I love the fingers.

3707
02:14:45,670 --> 02:14:46,470
I know I know.

3708
02:14:47,909 --> 02:14:49,430
It was just completely sus.

3709
02:14:51,989 --> 02:14:53,270
I'm down to play more if you are.

3710
02:14:55,270 --> 02:14:58,069
Sticking out of your sussy belly.

3711
02:14:59,590 --> 02:15:00,949
I wish I never said that.

3712
02:15:00,949 --> 02:15:02,390
Oh I don't think that's a hand.

3713
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:03,270
I wish you didn't either.

3714
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:06,470
I'll do a couple more.

3715
02:15:06,470 --> 02:15:06,710
No.

3716
02:15:09,029 --> 02:15:11,430
Yeah I mean we need ball fondler.

3717
02:15:11,590 --> 02:15:12,149
Oh thank god.

3718
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:15,350
Oh thank god I'm blank.

3719
02:15:17,350 --> 02:15:17,989
Once again.

3720
02:15:24,579 --> 02:15:25,380
I'm gonna go this way.

3721
02:15:29,590 --> 02:15:30,550
Okay so I'm gonna go...

3722
02:15:33,460 --> 02:15:35,810
Yeah I'll do this.

3723
02:15:35,810 --> 02:15:43,989
This one's taking a long time.

3724
02:15:43,989 --> 02:15:44,550
What the fuck?

3725
02:15:45,939 --> 02:15:46,819
All right I got that done.

3726
02:15:48,789 --> 02:15:49,189
Jesus.

3727
02:15:52,789 --> 02:15:53,109
Speak.

3728
02:15:53,829 --> 02:15:54,789
Speak if you're here.

3729
02:15:54,789 --> 02:15:57,989
Even though I just charted it I guess it's good to you know redo my work.

3730
02:15:57,989 --> 02:16:01,189
Exactly I just may have course corrected for you all over here.

3731
02:16:01,189 --> 02:16:01,670
Yeah yeah.

3732
02:16:01,670 --> 02:16:02,550
I did my task over there.

3733
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:03,109
Okay there we go.

3734
02:16:03,829 --> 02:16:04,310
Beautiful.

3735
02:16:04,310 --> 02:16:04,789
That's good.

3736
02:16:04,789 --> 02:16:05,270
Is this one done?

3737
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:06,550
Congratulations.

3738
02:16:06,550 --> 02:16:06,949
Thank you.

3739
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:10,149
What's the vent do?

3740
02:16:10,149 --> 02:16:11,909
Wait why did you just look at that and then turn around?

3741
02:16:11,909 --> 02:16:12,390
He just went in the vent.

3742
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:12,949
He just went in the vent.

3743
02:16:12,949 --> 02:16:13,510
He just went in the vent.

3744
02:16:13,510 --> 02:16:14,069
He just went in the vent.

3745
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:14,470
He just went in the vent.

3746
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:15,430
Oh my god he actually did.

3747
02:16:15,430 --> 02:16:16,229
He actually did.

3748
02:16:16,229 --> 02:16:16,789
Oh my god.

3749
02:16:16,789 --> 02:16:17,270
Oh my god.

3750
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:17,909
Report it.

3751
02:16:17,909 --> 02:16:18,390
Report it.

3752
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:19,109
No one will believe you.

3753
02:16:19,109 --> 02:16:19,430
Okay.

3754
02:16:20,789 --> 02:16:22,310
He just said no one will believe you.

3755
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:22,789
He just said no one will believe you.

3756
02:16:22,789 --> 02:16:23,590
You idiot.

3757
02:16:23,590 --> 02:16:24,630
You dummy.

3758
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:25,510
You big dummy.

3759
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:26,149
I was there too.

3760
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:27,989
What are you doing with the little side bucket thing?

3761
02:16:27,989 --> 02:16:29,109
He went in the vent too.

3762
02:16:29,109 --> 02:16:29,989
He vented.

3763
02:16:29,989 --> 02:16:30,310
Who me?

3764
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:31,029
Don't worry Zam.

3765
02:16:31,029 --> 02:16:31,510
I looked over.

3766
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:32,709
You were definitely doing a task.

3767
02:16:32,709 --> 02:16:34,549
Wait was he the one that vented or was there a different man?

3768
02:16:34,549 --> 02:16:36,309
I think he vented.

3769
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:37,750
Wait.

3770
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:39,750
Oh shit.

3771
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:40,709
Yeah definitely.

3772
02:16:40,709 --> 02:16:41,829
Wait who was in the room with us?

3773
02:16:41,829 --> 02:16:43,110
Who was in the room with us when we were?

3774
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:43,750
I was there with you.

3775
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:44,069
You were there.

3776
02:16:44,069 --> 02:16:45,190
Who else was in there?

3777
02:16:45,190 --> 02:16:47,670
I did see you guys do tasks too so.

3778
02:16:47,670 --> 02:16:48,479
Who was?

3779
02:16:48,479 --> 02:16:49,280
Who went in the vent?

3780
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:50,479
I was round things then.

3781
02:16:50,479 --> 02:16:51,280
Vinny can confirm.

3782
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:52,079
I was pumping.

3783
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:54,399
Did you go in the vent or did you go in the vent?

3784
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:56,319
We can't ask them that.

3785
02:16:56,319 --> 02:16:57,120
They're not going to tell me.

3786
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:00,000
I know but who was in the room with me?

3787
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,280
I don't know.

3788
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:02,079
Who was in my room?

3789
02:17:02,079 --> 02:17:03,200
It was Rambo but he's dead.

3790
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:04,799
Did we ever think maybe we should just talk?

3791
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:05,760
It was you or you?

3792
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:06,639
I think it's no it's you.

3793
02:17:06,639 --> 02:17:07,200
Just tell us.

3794
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:07,680
It's you.

3795
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:08,479
That's a lot of talking.

3796
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:09,920
Okay.

3797
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:11,520
Me and Rambo were in the room.

3798
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:12,319
Somebody vented.

3799
02:17:12,319 --> 02:17:14,079
We said holy shit he vented.

3800
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:15,040
I don't know the one with the um.

3801
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,200
Maybe we should stick together from now on.

3802
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,399
The captain's room or something?

3803
02:17:18,399 --> 02:17:19,200
Navigation?

3804
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:20,239
You vented.

3805
02:17:20,239 --> 02:17:21,200
I saw you go in the vent.

3806
02:17:22,079 --> 02:17:23,440
I was over in shields.

3807
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:25,280
Look is there a vent in shields?

3808
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:26,639
This isn't very complicated.

3809
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:29,120
Let me let me give my you know version of events.

3810
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:34,000
I see I see Jerma in navigation with failboat and Rambo.

3811
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:34,500
Yep.

3812
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:37,440
Jerma starts saying he vented he vented

3813
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:41,280
and then while he's saying that yellow runs up and kills Rambo

3814
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:44,719
and Jerma goes oh my god oh my god oh my god and then I reported the body.

3815
02:17:44,719 --> 02:17:45,760
Act exactly.

3816
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:48,000
Okay that's pretty realistic.

3817
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,639
Fairly realistic interpretation considering how I wasn't there.

3818
02:17:50,639 --> 02:17:51,200
I was in shields.

3819
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:52,959
Boat boat boat.

3820
02:17:52,959 --> 02:17:55,600
Yes no it's failboat it's failboat.

3821
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:56,639
You can't see my name.

3822
02:17:56,639 --> 02:17:58,319
You have no idea who I am right now.

3823
02:17:58,319 --> 02:17:58,719
Thank you.

3824
02:17:58,719 --> 02:18:00,319
I could never have done that as good as you did.

3825
02:18:02,639 --> 02:18:04,559
You're just talking about venting for like last minute.

3826
02:18:06,979 --> 02:18:08,020
Yep there you go.

3827
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:10,020
Oh okay.

3828
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:12,020
It was very good explaining like a human.

3829
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:14,120
Vent.

3830
02:18:14,979 --> 02:18:16,020
Yellow or orange.

3831
02:18:16,020 --> 02:18:17,379
One of those lighter.

3832
02:18:17,379 --> 02:18:18,260
I don't know.

3833
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:19,459
Yellow orange maybe.

3834
02:18:19,459 --> 02:18:19,959
I don't know.

3835
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:23,799
You're ignoring the fact that you saw him literally kill someone.

3836
02:18:23,799 --> 02:18:25,639
I just I don't know man it's stressful.

3837
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:29,770
Okay well I can I can Kraken I can trust you.

3838
02:18:30,489 --> 02:18:32,250
I can try I'm staying with you I can trust you.

3839
02:18:32,809 --> 02:18:35,350
What are you doing that for?

3840
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:38,420
This is is that you're making a funny thing here.

3841
02:18:41,350 --> 02:18:46,709
I'm in storage with Kraken by the way if anybody can hear me.

3842
02:18:50,299 --> 02:18:53,659
I'm in storage with Kraken Kraken and I are having a fun time.

3843
02:18:57,879 --> 02:18:59,959
No it couldn't have been you because that couldn't have been you.

3844
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,719
You would have had to be in the menu.

3845
02:19:08,069 --> 02:19:09,350
Has the loser said what?

3846
02:19:10,389 --> 02:19:12,340
What is happening in here?

3847
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:13,540
We got to fix this.

3848
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:15,379
He's kind of being weird he won't talk.

3849
02:19:15,379 --> 02:19:17,020
Okay fixed.

3850
02:19:17,899 --> 02:19:19,129
What do you mean fixed?

3851
02:19:20,090 --> 02:19:21,530
I just fixed the sabotage.

3852
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:22,090
No you didn't.

3853
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:25,340
Yes what are you talking there's still another room.

3854
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:27,020
There's still it's still counting down.

3855
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:28,219
It's counting down still.

3856
02:19:30,809 --> 02:19:31,530
We're gonna lose.

3857
02:19:34,409 --> 02:19:35,450
What what happened?

3858
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:36,010
What happened?

3859
02:19:36,010 --> 02:19:36,729
It's that easy.

3860
02:19:36,729 --> 02:19:37,690
It's that easy.

3861
02:19:37,690 --> 02:19:38,489
It's that easy.

3862
02:19:38,489 --> 02:19:39,450
It's just that easy.

3863
02:19:39,450 --> 02:19:40,409
It's just that easy.

3864
02:19:40,409 --> 02:19:41,370
It's just that easy.

3865
02:19:41,370 --> 02:19:44,649
I was just like what is that easy?

3866
02:19:44,649 --> 02:19:48,569
You guys just stood there for a second.

3867
02:19:48,569 --> 02:19:50,010
He was being weird.

3868
02:19:50,010 --> 02:19:50,969
He wouldn't talk.

3869
02:19:52,729 --> 02:19:53,610
You wouldn't talk.

3870
02:19:53,610 --> 02:19:55,850
I killed in front of you.

3871
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:57,209
How did you think it wasn't me?

3872
02:19:57,209 --> 02:19:58,569
I don't know but he wouldn't talk to me.

3873
02:19:58,569 --> 02:19:59,690
He was just being weird.

3874
02:20:00,569 --> 02:20:01,770
He was fucking weird.

3875
02:20:02,729 --> 02:20:03,370
I'm sorry okay.

3876
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:04,569
You were suffocating.

3877
02:20:04,889 --> 02:20:05,530
Shake my hand.

3878
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:06,409
Good games.

3879
02:20:06,409 --> 02:20:06,809
Good game.

3880
02:20:06,809 --> 02:20:08,809
Good game.

3881
02:20:14,809 --> 02:20:16,809
What do you mean what to see what I would do?

3882
02:20:16,809 --> 02:20:17,450
I'm scared.

3883
02:20:20,010 --> 02:20:20,969
I thought you were gonna kill me.

3884
02:20:22,489 --> 02:20:24,889
I was more concerned about people knowing that I was in the room with you.

3885
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:33,299
I mean he's like he's like behind me like creeping up and looking at me.

3886
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:35,059
That's toxic dude.

3887
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:38,979
What'd you say?

3888
02:20:52,819 --> 02:20:54,420
You can't say he's so bad.

3889
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:56,500
I'm being gaslit by my own crewmates.

3890
02:20:57,219 --> 02:20:57,700
Fuck me.

3891
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:05,219
People are like following me and like making noises behind me.

3892
02:21:05,219 --> 02:21:06,260
Call 02 if you're funny.

3893
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:07,620
Call 02 if you're funny right now.

3894
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:08,260
If I die it's Kraken.

3895
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:09,219
He told me so.

3896
02:21:09,219 --> 02:21:10,340
Call 02 if you're funny.

3897
02:21:11,700 --> 02:21:12,579
No one's funny.

3898
02:21:12,579 --> 02:21:13,860
Bunch of serious people in here.

3899
02:21:14,659 --> 02:21:27,239
Please please fix this.

3900
02:21:28,120 --> 02:21:29,190
Please fix.

3901
02:21:33,239 --> 02:21:38,600
Please fix.

3902
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:39,159
Is it fixed?

3903
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:41,159
Yeah it's fixed.

3904
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:41,879
All right I was trying to.

3905
02:21:41,879 --> 02:21:42,840
You're the imposter right?

3906
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:44,280
No I would you would be dead right now.

3907
02:21:48,229 --> 02:21:51,030
Kraken you told me if you were imposter you'd kill me.

3908
02:21:52,010 --> 02:21:53,770
I would I mean but you're not dead are you?

3909
02:21:53,770 --> 02:21:57,049
I mean I don't want to press I didn't want to press I didn't mean to do that.

3910
02:21:58,010 --> 02:22:00,250
I honestly skip skip skip.

3911
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:01,290
All right what do you have to say for yourself?

3912
02:22:01,290 --> 02:22:02,329
What do you have to say for yourself?

3913
02:22:02,329 --> 02:22:03,209
This is very simple.

3914
02:22:03,209 --> 02:22:03,690
What was that?

3915
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:04,569
Very simple.

3916
02:22:04,569 --> 02:22:07,450
I was hovering my hand over it because I was scared that Kraken was going to kill Vinny

3917
02:22:07,450 --> 02:22:08,809
and I accidentally touched it.

3918
02:22:08,809 --> 02:22:09,309
Skip.

3919
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:10,770
Okay.

3920
02:22:11,629 --> 02:22:12,590
I mean that checks out.

3921
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:17,149
We were in the same room that Kraken is going to kill someone.

3922
02:22:17,149 --> 02:22:20,030
He was just creeping around behind Vinny and I don't know.

3923
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:21,389
You just think I'm a creepy guy right?

3924
02:22:21,389 --> 02:22:21,950
Admit it.

3925
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:24,110
I followed the last round and I'm following Vinny.

3926
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:25,629
That's just how he is.

3927
02:22:25,629 --> 02:22:26,430
It was a little weird.

3928
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:27,709
I can't help the way I walk.

3929
02:22:27,709 --> 02:22:29,229
Well people should know as a weird walker.

3930
02:22:29,229 --> 02:22:30,190
That just might be the way he is.

3931
02:22:30,190 --> 02:22:31,709
As a weird walker.

3932
02:22:31,709 --> 02:22:33,549
Vinny you can take the floor here because I don't know.

3933
02:22:34,270 --> 02:22:36,670
I'm gonna just uh skip.

3934
02:22:36,670 --> 02:22:37,870
I would skip I would skip.

3935
02:22:37,870 --> 02:22:38,430
I didn't.

3936
02:22:38,430 --> 02:22:38,989
Vinny.

3937
02:22:38,989 --> 02:22:39,489
Vinny.

3938
02:22:39,489 --> 02:22:40,829
Me and Kraken had previous peeps.

3939
02:22:40,829 --> 02:22:41,389
It's fine now.

3940
02:22:41,389 --> 02:22:41,709
Yes.

3941
02:22:41,709 --> 02:22:42,190
Vinny.

3942
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:43,629
Prove you're a man of love right now.

3943
02:22:43,629 --> 02:22:44,670
Give me a hug.

3944
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:45,549
Prove you're a man of love.

3945
02:22:46,430 --> 02:22:46,930
Yeah.

3946
02:22:46,930 --> 02:22:47,430
There we go.

3947
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:47,930
There we go.

3948
02:22:47,930 --> 02:22:48,430
There we go.

3949
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:48,930
Yeah.

3950
02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:49,430
There we go.

3951
02:22:49,430 --> 02:22:50,430
Alright alright that's a man of love.

3952
02:22:50,430 --> 02:22:51,229
I like these two.

3953
02:22:51,229 --> 02:22:51,729
That's a real one.

3954
02:22:51,729 --> 02:22:52,229
That's a real one.

3955
02:22:52,229 --> 02:22:52,729
I think they're not.

3956
02:22:52,729 --> 02:22:53,229
These guys are sweet.

3957
02:22:53,229 --> 02:22:53,729
They were good.

3958
02:22:53,729 --> 02:22:54,229
They were good.

3959
02:22:54,229 --> 02:22:54,729
Yeah.

3960
02:22:54,729 --> 02:22:55,790
We need to skip the vote.

3961
02:22:55,790 --> 02:22:56,290
Skip.

3962
02:22:58,290 --> 02:22:58,790
Skip.

3963
02:22:59,309 --> 02:22:59,950
Skip the vote.

3964
02:22:59,950 --> 02:23:01,309
Oh that's right that's right that's right.

3965
02:23:01,309 --> 02:23:03,629
Here we are fucking virtually.

3966
02:23:04,510 --> 02:23:05,010
Yeah.

3967
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:09,190
All we need is a mirror so we can touch our own faces while we look at each other.

3968
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:10,190
Oh that would be pretty nice.

3969
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:11,190
I didn't mean to touch it.

3970
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:12,190
We did have VR chat.

3971
02:23:12,190 --> 02:23:13,190
Yeah yeah yeah.

3972
02:23:13,190 --> 02:23:15,579
Alright we can move.

3973
02:23:15,579 --> 02:23:16,579
Alright.

3974
02:23:16,579 --> 02:23:17,579
See you guys.

3975
02:23:17,579 --> 02:23:18,579
Have a good day at work.

3976
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:35,239
Stay with me here.

3977
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:36,239
Stay with me here.

3978
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:38,440
I'm with you.

3979
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:40,129
Yeah I'm sure you do.

3980
02:23:40,129 --> 02:23:41,129
Stay with me here.

3981
02:23:41,129 --> 02:23:42,569
Oh you actually did have a task here.

3982
02:23:42,569 --> 02:23:43,569
Wow.

3983
02:23:43,569 --> 02:23:45,579
Yeah.

3984
02:23:45,579 --> 02:23:46,579
Hey what's up guys.

3985
02:23:46,579 --> 02:23:47,579
What's up.

3986
02:23:47,579 --> 02:23:48,579
Hey.

3987
02:23:48,579 --> 02:23:49,579
Baby don't hurt me.

3988
02:23:49,579 --> 02:23:50,579
Stay together.

3989
02:23:50,579 --> 02:23:52,139
I agree.

3990
02:23:52,139 --> 02:23:53,139
Let's just go over here.

3991
02:23:53,139 --> 02:23:54,139
Yeah.

3992
02:23:54,139 --> 02:23:55,139
I'm sticking with Vinesauce.

3993
02:23:55,139 --> 02:23:56,139
My good friend Vinesauce.

3994
02:23:56,139 --> 02:23:59,950
Criken I'm sorry I have ill to you.

3995
02:23:59,950 --> 02:24:01,270
I have a license to ill.

3996
02:24:01,270 --> 02:24:07,459
Can I get behind you here?

3997
02:24:07,459 --> 02:24:08,459
I'm getting the silence.

3998
02:24:08,459 --> 02:24:09,459
Just get behind you.

3999
02:24:09,459 --> 02:24:10,459
I got it.

4000
02:24:10,459 --> 02:24:11,459
Like what.

4001
02:24:11,459 --> 02:24:13,870
I'm sorry man.

4002
02:24:13,870 --> 02:24:14,870
I got it.

4003
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:16,790
All my tasks are on the other side.

4004
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:17,790
All my tasks are on the other side.

4005
02:24:17,790 --> 02:24:18,790
This is a teleport right.

4006
02:24:18,790 --> 02:24:19,790
I can get quickly over there.

4007
02:24:19,790 --> 02:24:21,989
Can you guys just click this right here.

4008
02:24:21,989 --> 02:24:22,989
Just click that.

4009
02:24:22,989 --> 02:24:23,989
Sure.

4010
02:24:23,989 --> 02:24:24,989
See.

4011
02:24:24,989 --> 02:24:25,989
Let me give it a shot.

4012
02:24:25,989 --> 02:24:26,989
Listen listen.

4013
02:24:27,950 --> 02:24:28,950
Oh my god.

4014
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:29,950
Oh my god.

4015
02:24:29,950 --> 02:24:30,950
Oh my god.

4016
02:24:30,950 --> 02:24:31,950
Oh my god.

4017
02:24:31,950 --> 02:24:32,950
Oh my god.

4018
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:33,950
Oh my god.

4019
02:24:33,950 --> 02:24:34,950
We gotta get over there quickly.

4020
02:24:34,950 --> 02:24:35,950
This is terrifying.

4021
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:36,950
He did it.

4022
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:37,950
He actually did it.

4023
02:24:37,950 --> 02:24:38,950
He did it.

4024
02:24:38,950 --> 02:24:39,950
He actually did it.

4025
02:24:39,950 --> 02:24:40,950
He can't kill us right.

4026
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:41,950
He actually did it.

4027
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:42,950
Press the button.

4028
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:43,950
Is this the cake or is this real.

4029
02:24:43,950 --> 02:24:44,950
That son of a bitch.

4030
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:47,719
One second.

4031
02:24:47,719 --> 02:24:48,719
Hold on a second.

4032
02:24:48,719 --> 02:24:49,719
And what's going on.

4033
02:24:49,719 --> 02:24:50,719
What's going on.

4034
02:24:50,719 --> 02:24:51,719
What's going on.

4035
02:24:51,719 --> 02:24:52,719
No bodies.

4036
02:24:52,719 --> 02:24:54,719
No bodies.

4037
02:24:54,719 --> 02:24:55,719
Let me take the floor.

4038
02:24:55,719 --> 02:24:58,440
Let me take the floor.

4039
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:04,760
I was with Jerma and I was with Charbord and I just said hey can you guys go to the vent

4040
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:05,799
and click it.

4041
02:25:05,799 --> 02:25:07,360
That way you can see if you're a sus.

4042
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:08,360
And you know what.

4043
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:09,360
Criken is the sus.

4044
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:10,360
What.

4045
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:11,360
What.

4046
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:12,360
He clicked on the vent.

4047
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:13,360
He clicked on the vent and went inside.

4048
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:14,360
Wait.

4049
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:15,360
Is it these two.

4050
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:16,360
What.

4051
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:17,360
No it's Charbord.

4052
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:18,360
No it's Charbord.

4053
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:19,360
Let me explain myself.

4054
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,360
Let me explain myself.

4055
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:21,360
How did you vent.

4056
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:22,360
Tell me how you vent.

4057
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:23,360
Let me.

4058
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:24,360
Let me.

4059
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:25,360
Let me live this.

4060
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:27,280
Let me.

4061
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:28,280
Let me.

4062
02:25:28,280 --> 02:25:29,280
Let me live this round.

4063
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:30,280
Let me live this round.

4064
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:31,280
And I will kill Criken.

4065
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:32,280
That's so funny.

4066
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:33,280
It would be super funny.

4067
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:34,280
You know what.

4068
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:35,280
Don't be funny.

4069
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:36,280
No please.

4070
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:37,280
It would be kind of funny.

4071
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,280
It would be kind of funny.

4072
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:39,280
That's funny.

4073
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:40,280
That's funny.

4074
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:41,280
That would be kind of funny.

4075
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:42,280
Are we kidding.

4076
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:43,280
No.

4077
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,280
It would be funny.

4078
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:45,280
Just kill Criken and we can all laugh.

4079
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:48,280
I will kill Charbord because he has admitted to being the imposter.

4080
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:49,280
It's him.

4081
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:50,280
Okay.

4082
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:51,280
I like you.

4083
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:52,280
I like you.

4084
02:25:52,280 --> 02:25:53,280
It's definitely.

4085
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,280
It's guaranteed to be him.

4086
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:55,280
But that would be kind of humorous.

4087
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:57,200
Guys.

4088
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:58,200
He's going to.

4089
02:25:58,200 --> 02:25:59,200
It's going to be so funny.

4090
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,200
He's going to die.

4091
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:01,200
Well.

4092
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,200
He had good logic just now.

4093
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:03,200
Oh.

4094
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,200
Okay.

4095
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:05,200
It's airtight.

4096
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,200
It's actually airtight.

4097
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:07,200
Well we all know.

4098
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:08,200
We know who one is.

4099
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:09,200
Two people and Charbord though.

4100
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:10,200
Criken.

4101
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:11,200
I'm coming for you.

4102
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:12,200
No please.

4103
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:13,200
You better run.

4104
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,200
You better run.

4105
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:15,200
Alright.

4106
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:16,200
Alright.

4107
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:17,200
I kind of want to see this actually.

4108
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:18,200
I know.

4109
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:19,200
I kind of.

4110
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,200
Can we all just watch?

4111
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:21,200
Let's just watch.

4112
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:22,200
Let's see.

4113
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:23,200
Let's see.

4114
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:24,200
Which room would you like it to be in Criken?

4115
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:25,200
I don't want it to die.

4116
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:27,120
I'm coming for you.

4117
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:28,120
It's going to be so funny.

4118
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:29,120
It's going to be so funny.

4119
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:30,120
There he goes.

4120
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,120
Oh.

4121
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:32,120
Oh.

4122
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:33,120
Oh.

4123
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:34,120
Oh.

4124
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:35,120
Oh.

4125
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,120
Oh.

4126
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:37,120
Oh.

4127
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:38,120
Now you believe that?

4128
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:39,120
Does anyone know what we do?

4129
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:40,120
That was new.

4130
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:41,120
He's killing Criken.

4131
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:42,120
We're fine.

4132
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:43,120
We're completely safe.

4133
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:44,120
Criken mistake.

4134
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:45,120
We're completely safe right now.

4135
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:46,120
Don't worry.

4136
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:47,120
He's killing Criken.

4137
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:48,120
Why didn't you kill my Criken?

4138
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:49,120
We just chilled.

4139
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:50,120
What task?

4140
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:51,120
Hold on.

4141
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:52,120
I'll be right back.

4142
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:53,120
I'm going back by the main room.

4143
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:54,120
I'm waiting for Criken.

4144
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:55,120
Wait.

4145
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:57,040
Wait for him to kill Criken.

4146
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:58,040
I actually just forgot who went into that vent.

4147
02:26:58,040 --> 02:26:59,040
Charborg.

4148
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:00,040
I forgot who did that.

4149
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:01,040
It was Charborg.

4150
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:02,040
Oh, okay.

4151
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:03,040
The green one.

4152
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,040
Someone vented?

4153
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:05,040
Charborg did, yeah.

4154
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:06,040
Yeah.

4155
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:07,219
Yeah, he did.

4156
02:27:07,219 --> 02:27:08,219
And we're all just calm about it?

4157
02:27:08,219 --> 02:27:09,219
We're all just chill with this?

4158
02:27:09,219 --> 02:27:10,219
This is an okay thing?

4159
02:27:10,219 --> 02:27:11,219
Yeah.

4160
02:27:11,219 --> 02:27:12,219
He showed us.

4161
02:27:12,219 --> 02:27:13,219
Yeah.

4162
02:27:13,219 --> 02:27:14,219
He showed he can be transparent.

4163
02:27:14,219 --> 02:27:16,739
You kind of just pretended to not know that we all knew that it was him.

4164
02:27:16,739 --> 02:27:18,979
Don't you think that's a little weird?

4165
02:27:18,979 --> 02:27:20,159
What?

4166
02:27:20,159 --> 02:27:21,159
No.

4167
02:27:21,159 --> 02:27:23,159
I genuinely just forgot which green it was.

4168
02:27:23,159 --> 02:27:25,159
I don't know.

4169
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:26,600
I'm not being suspicious.

4170
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:27,600
Why are you going over there?

4171
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:28,600
Go ahead and stand over there.

4172
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:29,600
Don't make this a me-against-you thing.

4173
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:30,600
Okay.

4174
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:32,120
No, I just genuinely forgot which green it was.

4175
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:33,120
I couldn't tell.

4176
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:37,600
Can you stand by this vent and just press the trigger button?

4177
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:38,600
Oh, yeah, sure.

4178
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:39,600
Yeah, sure.

4179
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:40,600
I can do that.

4180
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:41,600
Look.

4181
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:42,600
I'm going to press all my buttons, okay?

4182
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:43,959
Okay.

4183
02:27:43,959 --> 02:27:45,559
That'll sound like genuine button presses to me.

4184
02:27:45,559 --> 02:27:46,559
There we go.

4185
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:47,559
See?

4186
02:27:47,559 --> 02:27:48,559
I'm pressing buttons.

4187
02:27:48,559 --> 02:27:49,559
See?

4188
02:27:49,559 --> 02:27:50,559
I'm pressing the buttons.

4189
02:27:50,559 --> 02:27:51,559
It's working.

4190
02:27:51,559 --> 02:27:52,559
We're good.

4191
02:27:52,559 --> 02:27:53,559
Okay.

4192
02:27:53,559 --> 02:27:54,559
That's fair.

4193
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:55,600
He's coming at me.

4194
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:56,600
He's coming at me.

4195
02:27:56,600 --> 02:27:57,600
Hey, how are you?

4196
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:58,600
I'm watching.

4197
02:28:02,250 --> 02:28:03,250
What happened?

4198
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:04,250
I couldn't get him.

4199
02:28:04,250 --> 02:28:05,250
What can I say?

4200
02:28:05,250 --> 02:28:06,250
I couldn't get him.

4201
02:28:06,250 --> 02:28:07,250
He was too quick.

4202
02:28:07,250 --> 02:28:08,250
That was so funny.

4203
02:28:08,250 --> 02:28:09,250
But you're still alive?

4204
02:28:09,250 --> 02:28:10,250
Give me one more round.

4205
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:11,250
One more round.

4206
02:28:11,250 --> 02:28:12,250
You're out.

4207
02:28:12,250 --> 02:28:13,250
You're out.

4208
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:14,250
He's out.

4209
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:15,250
I took too long.

4210
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:16,250
You're out.

4211
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:17,250
No, he's out.

4212
02:28:17,250 --> 02:28:18,250
He's out.

4213
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:20,250
Me and Failboat had a full deliberation for like a minute and a half, and you still hadn't

4214
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:21,250
killed Kraikin.

4215
02:28:21,250 --> 02:28:22,250
You're out.

4216
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:23,250
I was giving him a chance to talk, and then he just ran.

4217
02:28:23,250 --> 02:28:24,250
No, you're bad at this.

4218
02:28:24,250 --> 02:28:25,250
You're bad at this game.

4219
02:28:25,290 --> 02:28:26,290
I'm telling you.

4220
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:28,290
I understand.

4221
02:28:28,290 --> 02:28:29,290
It's fine.

4222
02:28:29,290 --> 02:28:30,290
How did you not kill him?

4223
02:28:30,290 --> 02:28:31,290
You gotta be gone.

4224
02:28:31,290 --> 02:28:32,290
I was just giving him a chance to talk.

4225
02:28:32,290 --> 02:28:33,290
I ran.

4226
02:28:34,290 --> 02:28:35,290
You're just good at this game.

4227
02:28:35,290 --> 02:28:36,290
What can I say?

4228
02:28:37,290 --> 02:28:38,290
You just avoided him the whole time.

4229
02:28:38,290 --> 02:28:39,290
All right.

4230
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:40,290
Give me a pat on the back.

4231
02:28:40,290 --> 02:28:41,290
All right.

4232
02:28:41,290 --> 02:28:42,290
Green gang.

4233
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:43,290
Green gang.

4234
02:28:43,290 --> 02:28:44,290
Nice try.

4235
02:28:44,290 --> 02:28:45,290
See you.

4236
02:28:45,290 --> 02:28:46,290
Good try, buddy.

4237
02:28:46,290 --> 02:28:47,290
See you next time.

4238
02:28:47,290 --> 02:28:48,290
It was all right.

4239
02:28:48,290 --> 02:28:49,290
It was all right.

4240
02:28:49,290 --> 02:28:50,290
You are convicted, Fallen, but it's okay.

4241
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:51,290
I think it's also possible to be you.

4242
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:52,290
Enjoy the rest of your round, everybody.

4243
02:28:52,290 --> 02:28:53,290
It's not me.

4244
02:28:53,290 --> 02:28:54,290
It's not me.

4245
02:28:54,329 --> 02:28:55,329
Hey, hey, hey.

4246
02:28:55,329 --> 02:28:56,329
You're funny.

4247
02:28:56,329 --> 02:28:57,329
You're funny.

4248
02:28:57,329 --> 02:28:58,329
You know what?

4249
02:28:58,329 --> 02:28:59,329
The other one is home alone.

4250
02:28:59,329 --> 02:29:04,450
Don't you guys think it's kind of interesting that nobody else died because, oh, wait, we're

4251
02:29:04,450 --> 02:29:07,129
going to wait for Kraken to die, right?

4252
02:29:07,129 --> 02:29:08,129
Got him.

4253
02:29:08,129 --> 02:29:09,129
Got him.

4254
02:29:09,129 --> 02:29:10,129
Got him.

4255
02:29:10,129 --> 02:29:11,129
Got him.

4256
02:29:11,129 --> 02:29:12,129
I have eight, okay?

4257
02:29:12,129 --> 02:29:13,129
It's not me.

4258
02:29:13,129 --> 02:29:14,129
I have eight fingers.

4259
02:29:14,129 --> 02:29:15,129
A guy with eight fingers can't kill someone.

4260
02:29:15,129 --> 02:29:16,129
Everyone knows this.

4261
02:29:16,129 --> 02:29:17,129
It's not me.

4262
02:29:17,129 --> 02:29:18,129
It's not me.

4263
02:29:18,129 --> 02:29:19,129
I swear to you, it's not me.

4264
02:29:19,129 --> 02:29:20,129
Please don't vote me.

4265
02:29:20,129 --> 02:29:21,129
I don't want to be a ghost man.

4266
02:29:21,129 --> 02:29:22,129
Got you.

4267
02:29:22,129 --> 02:29:23,129
Got you.

4268
02:29:23,129 --> 02:29:24,129
Got you.

4269
02:29:24,969 --> 02:29:25,969
It's not me.

4270
02:29:25,969 --> 02:29:26,969
It's literally not me.

4271
02:29:26,969 --> 02:29:27,969
Yeah, I think I believe him.

4272
02:29:27,969 --> 02:29:28,969
I believe him.

4273
02:29:28,969 --> 02:29:29,969
Why would he sell me?

4274
02:29:29,969 --> 02:29:30,969
I believe him.

4275
02:29:30,969 --> 02:29:31,969
I believe him.

4276
02:29:31,969 --> 02:29:32,969
Don't believe him.

4277
02:29:32,969 --> 02:29:33,969
Don't believe him.

4278
02:29:33,969 --> 02:29:34,969
I can prove it.

4279
02:29:34,969 --> 02:29:35,969
I can prove it.

4280
02:29:35,969 --> 02:29:36,969
Okay?

4281
02:29:36,969 --> 02:29:37,969
I swear to you, I can prove it.

4282
02:29:37,969 --> 02:29:38,969
I can prove it.

4283
02:29:38,969 --> 02:29:39,969
Watch me do this task.

4284
02:29:39,969 --> 02:29:41,659
Somebody went that way.

4285
02:29:41,659 --> 02:29:49,809
I'm here.

4286
02:29:49,809 --> 02:29:50,809
I'm here.

4287
02:29:50,809 --> 02:29:51,809
Kill me.

4288
02:29:51,809 --> 02:29:52,809
Kill me.

4289
02:29:52,809 --> 02:30:05,250
I'm here.

4290
02:30:05,250 --> 02:30:06,250
I'm here.

4291
02:30:06,250 --> 02:30:07,559
Kill me.

4292
02:30:07,559 --> 02:30:08,559
Wait a minute.

4293
02:30:08,559 --> 02:30:09,559
Arnold's voice.

4294
02:30:09,559 --> 02:30:10,559
Stop being like a fucking weird comedian guy.

4295
02:30:10,559 --> 02:30:12,120
Like, I've lost everybody.

4296
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:13,120
Oh, no.

4297
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:14,120
Oh, no.

4298
02:30:19,159 --> 02:30:20,159
Quickly.

4299
02:30:20,159 --> 02:30:22,620
Hurry up.

4300
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:23,620
Okay.

4301
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,620
It is...

4302
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:26,739
Quickly.

4303
02:30:26,739 --> 02:30:27,739
Quickly.

4304
02:30:27,739 --> 02:30:28,739
Come on.

4305
02:30:28,739 --> 02:30:29,739
I got it.

4306
02:30:29,739 --> 02:30:32,260
You got it?

4307
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:34,010
I got it.

4308
02:30:34,010 --> 02:30:35,010
Right?

4309
02:30:35,010 --> 02:30:36,010
I did it, right?

4310
02:30:36,010 --> 02:30:37,010
Yeah, I did it.

4311
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:38,010
I'll get him.

4312
02:30:38,010 --> 02:30:39,010
Weird.

4313
02:30:39,010 --> 02:30:40,010
Wait, is anyone going to get it?

4314
02:30:40,010 --> 02:30:41,010
Hold on.

4315
02:30:41,010 --> 02:30:42,010
I got it.

4316
02:30:42,010 --> 02:30:43,440
I did it.

4317
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:44,440
Wait.

4318
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:45,440
What's happening?

4319
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:46,440
Hey, calm down.

4320
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:47,440
Calm down.

4321
02:30:47,440 --> 02:30:48,440
Hey, home alone.

4322
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:49,440
Yeah, what's up?

4323
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:50,440
He's a little skittish, isn't he?

4324
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:51,440
Come here.

4325
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:52,440
Come to this side.

4326
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:53,440
Yeah, what's up?

4327
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:56,040
Okay, I got you.

4328
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:57,040
I got you.

4329
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:58,040
I clicked it.

4330
02:30:58,040 --> 02:30:59,040
See?

4331
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,040
It didn't work.

4332
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:01,040
It's home alone.

4333
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:02,040
It's home alone.

4334
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:03,040
Oh!

4335
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:07,030
Oh!

4336
02:31:07,030 --> 02:31:08,030
Oh!

4337
02:31:08,030 --> 02:31:09,030
Oh!

4338
02:31:09,030 --> 02:31:10,030
Oh!

4339
02:31:10,030 --> 02:31:11,030
Oh!

4340
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:12,030
Oh!

4341
02:31:12,030 --> 02:31:13,030
Oh!

4342
02:31:13,030 --> 02:31:14,030
Oh!

4343
02:31:14,030 --> 02:31:15,030
Oh!

4344
02:31:15,030 --> 02:31:16,030
Oh!

4345
02:31:16,030 --> 02:31:17,030
Oh!

4346
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:18,030
Oh!

4347
02:31:18,030 --> 02:31:19,030
Oh!

4348
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:20,200
Oh!

4349
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:21,200
Oh!

4350
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:22,200
Oh!

4351
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:23,200
Oh!

4352
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:24,200
Oh!

4353
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:25,200
Oh!

4354
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,200
Oh!

4355
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:28,040
Was it you?

4356
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:29,040
That was fucking demented.

4357
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:32,079
I genuinely didn't know if it was you or not, but then you admitted to it.

4358
02:31:32,079 --> 02:31:33,079
That was demented.

4359
02:31:33,079 --> 02:31:34,520
Oh, yeah, no, sorry.

4360
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:37,520
Yeah, I had no idea.

4361
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:41,200
You were, like, you did the click noise and I was convinced you were the sus.

4362
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:42,200
I was convinced.

4363
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:44,879
I just thought it'd be funny if I made a click noise instead of doing something.

4364
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:45,879
Yeah.

4365
02:31:45,879 --> 02:31:48,280
It was good, but I thought it was a complete omission of guilt.

4366
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:49,280
Time to vote.

4367
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:50,280
Yeah.

4368
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:51,280
Or admission of guilt.

4369
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:52,280
Yeah, no, see?

4370
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:53,280
I'm guilty and innocent at the same time.

4371
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:55,280
You know, we could all vote for Jerma, just for shits and gigs.

4372
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:56,920
They mean you could do that.

4373
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:57,920
I mean, I mean, I could, but I'd like to.

4374
02:31:57,920 --> 02:31:58,920
It may be a little bit late.

4375
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:01,920
Why would you want to be the imposter, you know?

4376
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:04,920
And when you kick me out, I'll do, like, a, nooooo!

4377
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:06,920
It would be wicked funny.

4378
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,920
That'd be pretty funny.

4379
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:12,920
Well, I would get a sensible couple for that.

4380
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:13,920
Eww!

4381
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:14,920
Yay!

4382
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:15,920
Whoa!

4383
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:16,920
Craig, how are you?

4384
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:17,920
Hey!

4385
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:18,920
Good work, everyone.

4386
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:19,920
Why am I so tall?

4387
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:20,920
Why does this keep happening?

4388
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:21,920
In every...

4389
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:22,920
I got room for one more.

4390
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:23,920
One more is good for me.

4391
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:24,920
I got room for one more.

4392
02:32:25,559 --> 02:32:26,559
That'd be perfect.

4393
02:32:26,559 --> 02:32:27,559
That'd be perfect.

4394
02:32:27,559 --> 02:32:30,559
So, my suspicion about Jolly ended up being confirmed.

4395
02:32:30,559 --> 02:32:31,559
Suspicion?

4396
02:32:31,559 --> 02:32:34,799
Yeah, I'm getting a little gassed.

4397
02:32:34,799 --> 02:32:37,799
COVID's kind of coming up here.

4398
02:32:37,799 --> 02:32:42,799
And I am definitely not the imposter.

4399
02:32:42,799 --> 02:32:44,799
And happy birthday, everyone.

4400
02:32:44,799 --> 02:32:45,799
Happy birthday!

4401
02:32:45,799 --> 02:32:46,799
Happy birthday!

4402
02:32:46,799 --> 02:32:49,799
Let's get out there and have a good birthday, everybody.

4403
02:32:49,799 --> 02:32:50,799
That's right, that's right!

4404
02:32:50,799 --> 02:32:51,799
Okay, I can't see.

4405
02:32:51,799 --> 02:32:52,799
There goes the power.

4406
02:32:52,799 --> 02:32:53,799
Okay, well...

4407
02:32:53,799 --> 02:32:54,799
Okay.

4408
02:32:56,379 --> 02:32:57,379
We're headin' there.

4409
02:32:58,379 --> 02:32:59,379
Headin' there.

4410
02:32:59,379 --> 02:33:00,750
Time to...

4411
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:01,750
Oh, I'm small again.

4412
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:02,750
Quick light doer.

4413
02:33:04,750 --> 02:33:05,750
Task completed!

4414
02:33:05,750 --> 02:33:06,750
I've never heard my...

4415
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:08,750
Congrats?

4416
02:33:08,750 --> 02:33:09,750
Thanks.

4417
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:11,750
Okay, so, let's stick together.

4418
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:12,750
I mean, like...

4419
02:33:12,750 --> 02:33:14,750
There's nothing better than that.

4420
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:16,750
You now have concrete proof.

4421
02:33:16,750 --> 02:33:17,750
That's right.

4422
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:19,750
We have to go out on a win with this one.

4423
02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:22,750
And by win, which team are you referring to?

4424
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:24,750
The crewmates, of course.

4425
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:25,750
Of course, of course.

4426
02:33:26,389 --> 02:33:27,389
Of course.

4427
02:33:27,389 --> 02:33:28,389
Hey.

4428
02:33:28,389 --> 02:33:29,389
Are we all crewmates here?

4429
02:33:29,389 --> 02:33:30,389
That one's easy.

4430
02:33:30,389 --> 02:33:31,389
You know my tasks.

4431
02:33:31,389 --> 02:33:32,389
Is everyone crewmates here?

4432
02:33:32,389 --> 02:33:33,389
Yeah, we're all task doers here.

4433
02:33:33,389 --> 02:33:34,389
We're all good.

4434
02:33:34,389 --> 02:33:35,389
Everyone's got a good amount of changes.

4435
02:33:35,389 --> 02:33:36,389
Just a bunch of task doers.

4436
02:33:36,389 --> 02:33:37,389
Just a bunch of task doers.

4437
02:33:37,389 --> 02:33:38,389
Okay, well...

4438
02:33:38,389 --> 02:33:39,389
Guys, we gotta go.

4439
02:33:39,389 --> 02:33:40,389
We gotta go.

4440
02:33:40,389 --> 02:33:41,389
We're all gonna die.

4441
02:33:41,389 --> 02:33:42,389
We can't let them win.

4442
02:33:42,389 --> 02:33:43,389
Another win?

4443
02:33:43,389 --> 02:33:44,389
Another win off this?

4444
02:33:44,389 --> 02:33:45,389
Shut up, guys.

4445
02:33:45,389 --> 02:33:46,389
Come on.

4446
02:33:46,389 --> 02:33:47,389
Get it together.

4447
02:33:47,389 --> 02:33:48,389
Shut up!

4448
02:33:48,389 --> 02:33:49,950
That's mean.

4449
02:33:49,950 --> 02:33:56,180
No.

4450
02:33:56,180 --> 02:33:57,180
I went the wrong way.

4451
02:33:57,180 --> 02:34:02,399
I'm going to the other one now.

4452
02:34:02,399 --> 02:34:03,899
Let's do this thing.

4453
02:34:04,540 --> 02:34:07,540
Dude, I swear to god I'm not doing this on purpose.

4454
02:34:07,540 --> 02:34:08,540
Okay.

4455
02:34:08,540 --> 02:34:09,969
Okay.

4456
02:34:09,969 --> 02:34:12,350
I was in a room with at least purple.

4457
02:34:12,350 --> 02:34:13,889
I thought I saw Kraikin.

4458
02:34:13,889 --> 02:34:16,149
It's me, you and there was one other.

4459
02:34:16,149 --> 02:34:18,149
I think it was green.

4460
02:34:18,149 --> 02:34:19,149
It was green.

4461
02:34:19,149 --> 02:34:20,149
They're not gonna admit.

4462
02:34:20,149 --> 02:34:21,149
It was me.

4463
02:34:21,149 --> 02:34:22,149
It was Kraikin.

4464
02:34:22,149 --> 02:34:23,149
Or both.

4465
02:34:23,149 --> 02:34:24,149
You there?

4466
02:34:24,149 --> 02:34:25,149
It's one of the three of us.

4467
02:34:25,149 --> 02:34:26,149
I saw you.

4468
02:34:26,149 --> 02:34:27,149
I did it.

4469
02:34:27,149 --> 02:34:28,149
I saw you.

4470
02:34:28,149 --> 02:34:29,149
I killed you.

4471
02:34:29,149 --> 02:34:30,149
We did it.

4472
02:34:30,149 --> 02:34:31,149
And I did it like this.

4473
02:34:31,149 --> 02:34:32,149
And I'll do it again.

4474
02:34:32,149 --> 02:34:35,829
like this and I'll do it again look me in the eye and tell me that you didn't do

4475
02:34:35,829 --> 02:34:59,229
it I actually don't think it was you I do have to say though that you you are

4476
02:34:59,229 --> 02:35:03,270
picking like probably the worst person to like be the person to confide in on

4477
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:13,069
this so I don't I think it was you hate yeah hey yeah yeah yeah you don't pick

4478
02:35:13,069 --> 02:35:19,069
the sus guy right to be like oh yeah yeah what he said is it accurate yeah I

4479
02:35:19,069 --> 02:35:23,270

4480
02:35:30,729 --> 02:35:36,209

4481
02:35:36,209 --> 02:35:40,010

disappeared Kraken was with us for a second ago and then he just disappeared

4500
02:37:25,530 --> 02:37:35,319

4502
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:43,959
yeah what's Kraken he ran up and said some suspicious stuff and then left I

4503
02:37:43,959 --> 02:37:46,559
think it's Kraken he's just kind of going off on his own we just locked us

4504
02:37:46,559 --> 02:37:52,920
out of here hello who just locked us out of here I didn't I need to go here

4505
02:37:52,920 --> 02:38:05,879
though hello how do we open this I think it's Kraken Kraken is just somehow

4506
02:38:05,879 --> 02:38:12,799
just wait where you going I thought that was like a dramatic exit what do you see

4507
02:38:12,799 --> 02:38:33,770
in there no no I don't know he did it I was in the wall okay it's red I didn't

4508
02:38:33,770 --> 02:38:37,129
see anything I'm so I'm not gonna Sam Sam sorry do you have anything to say

4509
02:38:37,129 --> 02:38:41,530
for yourself I cry kid was it was running towards the body and it just

4510
02:38:41,530 --> 02:38:45,850
fell on the floor I don't know how else to explain it I saw Kraken walking down

4511
02:38:45,850 --> 02:38:51,250
the hallway straight towards a guy and then he killed him what I saw you walked

4512
02:38:51,250 --> 02:38:54,329
straight towards somebody but then I went into a wall and it was went all

4513
02:38:54,329 --> 02:38:58,530
black and I didn't see anything after that okay here's what really happened

4514
02:38:58,530 --> 02:39:04,870
guys so my friend Ramby was over there and he was looking at me down a long

4515
02:39:04,870 --> 02:39:07,590
hallway and I thought what a great opportunity to do a jump scare so I

4516
02:39:07,590 --> 02:39:11,049
started slowly walking towards him like this he starts screaming right he says

4517
02:39:11,049 --> 02:39:15,610
it's Kraken it's Kraken Kraken's coming towards me then out of nowhere

4518
02:39:15,850 --> 02:39:21,489
he explodes into blood and red leaves the body on the floor that's when I

4519
02:39:21,489 --> 02:39:27,329
reported it you can see that I reported it yeah yeah I actually can't

4520
02:39:27,329 --> 02:39:30,850
corroborate this because I was in the wall I saw him walk towards the whole

4521
02:39:30,850 --> 02:39:34,409
thing happened so you know who did it so who did it I'm not I'm not gonna say who
