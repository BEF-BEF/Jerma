1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,620
Why am I seeing a bunch of- Finally, crack time. Crack time, crack time. Finally, it's crack time.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:15,740
Are you just sitting there waiting to smoke crack? Like you've got your crack on the table and your

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,539
crack pipe or your crack device. Are you just sitting there like a napkin is laid out in front

4
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:30,870
of you? Come on, come on, start the stream dude. He's late. I can't smoke this crack until he's here.

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:52,340
God damn it. Oh, live, live. Oh yeah. Yes, we have to wait. Oh, finally, crack time.

6
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:08,260
Anyways, how are you? Just like crack work. Yeah, we're going to play more house flipper today

7
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:14,519
for an undetermined amount of time. I might get bored in 30 minutes and we play Desperados 3

8
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,159
or I'll be here for another five or six straight fucking hours and then we're going to do,

9
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:31,500
we're just going to keep doing it. I don't know. Am I going to just sly Cooper?

10
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I don't know. Sly Cooper. You got to put that in the list of games that are similar to,

11
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:53,500
and I know people are going to be like, did he just sit? Hold on. I put like Jack and Dexter

12
00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:02,950
and Dexter and Jack's. What's that other one? This too. Ratchet and Clank. Ratchet and Clank,

13
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:13,750
Jack and Dexter. I feel like that's like a tag team fight. Okay. So that's very different.

14
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,500
Jekyll and Hyde. Take that. Say no, that you, okay. I thought you said, take that back.

15
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:31,669
You said, say hi back. Hey, how are you? They were competing platform mascot game. Yeah,

16
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:37,750
it's, I don't know. Sly Cooper just kind of fits there in my brain with like other mascot platformer

17
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:47,099
game. I thought you don't have a gun or anything. You don't just jump around and I only like Jack

18
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,979
one and they're all great. Hey, I know I haven't played them. I'm sure I will eventually on stream

19
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,379
and you delay the screen by five minutes. I have to enter the litter box.

20
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,150
I, it's going to probably take five minutes to go do it now and take probably five minutes

21
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:14,389
before I get into the game. This dude's a pathological liar. No, I'm a pathological

22
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:33,960
forgetter. There's a huge difference. You play PlayStation heroes. No, I haven't. That's a lie.

23
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,659
You're going to play fall guys. No, not today. Not today. I, I can't, I can't do it. I cannot

24
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:55,620
win. I finally pulled out of the seven 11 parking lot. That is like $42 scratch tickets. I don't

25
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:15,349
think I'm going to win. He's a selective pathological forgetter. You just described like

26
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:24,939
a patient in a Leslie Nielsen movie. What's the prognosis doctor? Oh, he's a selective

27
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:34,779
pathological forgetter. Interesting. Did you just who Leslie Nielsen? I want to ban that guy.

28
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:47,060
Are we getting a who on Leslie Nielsen? A who? A who on Leslie Nielsen? Oh boy. Do yourself a

29
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,980
favor. Just go watch every Leslie Nielsen movie from start to finish. And I'm even talking about

30
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,500
the ones that are in black and white that weren't comedies. Go watch those too. Watch them all.

31
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:05,269
Watch this whole catalog. He has like a hundred movies. I told that I told that person that they

32
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:16,660
could empty the litter box. Look, we haven't even done anything. The naked gun movies are

33
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:25,129
were a pretty major influence on what I think is funny. I used to watch those all the time.

34
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:51,449
Airplane, airplane movies, huge influences. Spaceballs, kind of the same era. I love the

35
00:05:51,449 --> 00:06:03,269
naked gun series. It was just ridiculous. He made so much money just being the guy that was dead

36
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:08,949
serious in absurd situations. It was just Leslie Nielsen. It was going to look at something with

37
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:15,829
a stern face and be completely deadpan while a clown like honked a horn behind him. It was

38
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:27,509
awesome. Is that police squad show? Yeah, that was what it was before, right? No, no, no. What was

39
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:38,459
it was? It was naked gun was the movies based on a TV show that got canceled, right? That's the one,

40
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:54,300
right? That police squad was first. What are you resident sleeper? Resident sleeper.

41
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:01,589
Just go watch. OK, you could resident sleep for me on this topic, but go watch naked gun.

42
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:10,009
And I bet you that resident sleeper face turns into like a hog mouth in about 45 minutes.

43
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,149
Leslie Nielsen who naked gun resident sleeper.

44
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:31,740
Shit, now I'm going to be 40 soon. All right, let's go. Let's play. Welcome back, everybody.

45
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,540
Hope you're having a good day. Hey, hope you're having a good day. What does that mean? I say

46
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,459
that a lot. I think a lot of people say that, like when they broadcast and they make videos,

47
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:48,970
they guess hope you're having a good day. I mean, I kind of I do, but that's always the go to.

48
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,759
All right, here's the Aqua teen house because every house is a fucking cartoon house. I

49
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,139
seriously couldn't stop thinking about this. I couldn't stop thinking about this the whole

50
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:04,790
night of this. I didn't even want this to be a cartoon house. But like the title says,

51
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:15,100
it's always a cartoon house. Always a mystic quests. That's what a great name that is.

52
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:25,620
Mystic quests. Thanks to the five community subs. And what is this? This is a image of me.

53
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:40,070
OK, hold on. I thought this was. Don't ask me why.

54
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:54,970
I thought that was ice. I thought I was sitting in ice, like an ice bath going like, oh,

55
00:08:55,929 --> 00:09:02,519
I saw it. It was this small when I saw it. I was like, oh, shit, like somebody made me like an

56
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:23,100
ice bath. It's a coke bath. No, no, we guys, we cannot. We this we cannot. We cannot.

57
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:44,899
What is going on? Weak to 2020. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is absurd.

58
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:54,169
I got to put this up. This is ridiculous. All right. We got up. I'm going to move on after

59
00:09:54,169 --> 00:10:02,460
this. We got to play. Is this because I took the week off? I didn't take a week off. I took

60
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:34,139
two months off. Fuck. This is fucking ridiculous. OK. All right. I got to let's get grounded here.

61
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:43,750
Oh, he's on vacation again. I wasn't on vacation. All right. Time to get to work.

62
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:51,450
You guys are grounded. OK, so I have to take a wall down. I cannot. This is this can't be

63
00:10:51,450 --> 00:11:02,700
Meatwad's room, but I have practiced the voice. OK, what are you doing? I don't want you in my

64
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:10,870
room. No, I don't think so. I think I want to get out of my room. I've been working on the voice as

65
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:23,049
of yet. It took me about four hours to get that correct. He did that yesterday. I didn't do the

66
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:27,850
high part. I didn't do that. What do you do? I didn't do that one yesterday. I did the low one.

67
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:41,159
It took me two hours in the bathtub saying that into the ceiling to get that right. But I have to

68
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,600
I can't do this. This has to change. This is I can't. This cannot be the Aqua Teen house.

69
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,299
I'm sorry. I have to get rid of this. I have to take this wall down. This cannot be an Aqua Teen

70
00:11:52,299 --> 00:12:00,139
house. No, no, it's not happening. I don't care. All every house cannot be a cartoon house,

71
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:04,700
not every. It's not going to be. Oh, do Family Guy, do the Simpsons, do Aqua Teen,

72
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:12,070
do the American Dad house. No, this is my house. My house is not a cartoon house. There's no sound.

73
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:33,929
Oh, shit. Sorry about that. It was on full blast. OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was

74
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:39,690
fucking loud. I know this sounds allowed. I didn't have the desktop audio pulled down a little.

75
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,149
What OST are we going to listen to today? How about the Aqua Teen Hunger Force OST?

76
00:12:46,149 --> 00:13:02,649
I'm not muted. What happened here? Who chipped this tooth? All right. What if what if the house

77
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:09,700
is just a giant garage? What? OK, what if this is a house for a car? Like you pull the car in

78
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,269
and you pull the car and you turn right and then you drive straight and you pull in into the

79
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,110
bedroom and you sleep in the car. And if you have to go to the bathroom, you have to like drive into

80
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:36,309
another room and like just pee out your window. A drive in house. Yeah. OK, this house makes sense

81
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:43,960
in some weird dystopian future where we have to stay in our cars because there are like there

82
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,210
are like weird aliens outside that will like implant themselves in your brain if you get out

83
00:13:49,210 --> 00:14:07,480
of your car. This is this is a post 5G world. I mean, I mean, I'm talking more about like

84
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,340
it's just like aliens and the aliens don't understand the cars for some reason, right?

85
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,860
That's like the weird plot of the movie. It's like for some strange reason, the aliens do not

86
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:30,220
understand cars and they they're afraid of them. They won't go near them. Kind of like how that's

87
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,580
a spoiler. I was going to make a direct reference to a movie, but it's the whole it's the whole

88
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:49,590
thing about to say is a spoiler. All right. Well, this is the first make sure we can make this turn.

89
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:59,620
Say it. No, I don't want to say I don't. I know people like movies open. Slime already did this

90
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:07,980
bit. Just give a spoiler warning. OK, here's I'm going to give you a spoiler warning. OK,

91
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:23,529
this is a spoiler warning for the movie Bird Box. OK, this is I'm about to make a major

92
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:31,480
talk about I'm going to talk about Bird Box. OK, just are you ready? Put it on screen.

93
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,190
All right. This is why this is like in the poster of the movie.

94
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,149
I don't know. Why do I need to? I don't need to. What the fuck do I care? This is in the poster

95
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:51,610
of the movie. It's Samantha. What's her name? Famous, incredibly talented, famous actress.

96
00:15:52,409 --> 00:16:02,169
Sandra Bullock, right? Nobody cares about Bird Box. Some one of you does. Who cares? Who cares?

97
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:08,009
No, you don't understand. People care about this shit. Do you know how much direct email

98
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:14,789
I've gotten about spoiling like the Lord of the Rings? I've got like seven pieces of fan mail

99
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:18,389
that were not fan mail at all. By the way, they lied in the subject and was like,

100
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:23,110
dude, such a huge fan. Click me. I love you. I'm like, oh, cool. And I click it.

101
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,940
It's like you fucking asshole. Fuck you, dude. I was on the last book and I had no idea

102
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:53,620
that Sauron was the eye. Piece of shit. I'm just like, dude, I'm fucking. OK, wait. It's like in the

103
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:02,120
menu. Like the devs. OK, I got to tell you about this. I'm so fucking annoyed with this movie.

104
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,720
We got to continue game. We got to move the obvious. Bird Box spoilers. Click here if you

105
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:14,039
want to see them, because I got to tell you. It's my review. All right. Anyways, no, but that's

106
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:23,000
good. Here we go. OK, so in the movie Bird Box, here comes the whole movie. In the movie,

107
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm going to tell you the whole movie. In the movie Bird Box, this these this aliens invade Earth

108
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,210
or something, and you can't look at them. They haven't. They didn't figure out that,

109
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:41,259
like, you have eyelids. You cannot look at them. If you look at them, you're in big fucking trouble.

110
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:46,119
You're you're in a lot of trouble if you look at them. But for some reason, they didn't figure

111
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:51,289
out that if everyone walks around with their eyes closed, they can just walk around like stab people

112
00:17:51,289 --> 00:18:01,750
that don't ever see it coming away. Know the whole point of the movie was the birds in the box.

113
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:05,670
The birds like chirped when they were around. Oh, yeah, the writers figured that part out.

114
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,750
That's right. Yeah, the writers like figured out a way to make it so like they couldn't just walk up

115
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:17,799
and stab people. Right. OK, that's that's the whole point of the movie. That's the whole it's in the

116
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:30,490
title. That's not what the movie was about. What are you talking about? But that doesn't that

117
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:40,410
doesn't happen in Bird Box. That's not Bird Box. That's a different movie. What do you mean? What

118
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:49,589
movie am I thinking of? Wait, so there's not a bird in Bird Box that tweets that chirps when

119
00:18:49,829 --> 00:19:01,319
the monsters are around. Yes, it is. This is a different movie. Spoils a different movie.

120
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:16,789
Movie. No, I'm being gaslit. All right. This is gaslighting. OK, where was I going with this?

121
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:23,019
What are you guys doing to me? Why do you guys say that thing about Bird Box? What did you do that

122
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:30,710
for? He's pretending for views. No, that's what happened. Long story short, in the movie Bird Box,

123
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,390
you have to keep your eyes closed and the aliens have not figured out a fucking way

124
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,430
of how to like get somebody to open their eyes so they don't know. They just stand around until

125
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:48,170
you open your eyes. So imagine like that your eyes are the car that happens in the movie Signs. No,

126
00:19:48,170 --> 00:20:03,400
it doesn't. You're doing with the house. No, this is yeah. It's about being gaslit. I'm saying that

127
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,200
like the aliens cannot figure out how to get you out of your car, just like how they couldn't

128
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:17,289
figure out how to get you to open your eyes in Bird Box. That's what I was saying. So you drive

129
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:20,809
around in your fucking car and you have to live in your car house because the aliens don't know

130
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:27,420
how to get you to understand your car. It's not a spoiler. It's a basic presence of the presence of

131
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:50,009
the movie. OK. OK, so in this world, you cars like is it does everybody in the family have their own

132
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:55,319
car that they drive around the house and if you want to go like get breakfast like, oh, here comes

133
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,710
like here comes like little little Timmy coming down the stairs in his car. His house is not big

134
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:15,210
enough for that. This is supposed to be your house. It is. I don't like it. It's an aqua teen

135
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:30,630
thing that fucks me all up. I don't want an aqua teen house. Now, how am I going to do this?

136
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:42,390
I'm not going to sell it. I'm not going to lose my money on it. That's not a spoiler. That's the

137
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:48,700
basic premise of the movie. That's what I was saying. But you don't understand the fucking hate

138
00:21:48,700 --> 00:22:07,960
mail that I've gotten. I want to pick this up. Just sell the damn thing. What do I care? This

139
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:16,009
was like fun for a little while, but like who cares about me making the stream room? This is

140
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:24,440
the garage. The garage leads down to a basement. Basement leads into a larger room and then a

141
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,779
bathroom. OK, there's a bathroom down here. This should just be the house. I just have a dummy

142
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,940
house upstairs like the burglars to go into if there's ever like a burglary or something,

143
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:46,089
just a fake house with a bunch of fake money. And then my house is down here. It's all just

144
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:52,740
like weird cardboard furniture and shit. But like my actual house is down there. I'm not going to

145
00:22:52,740 --> 00:23:04,250
sell these computers yet. This is a fortnight house. No, it's not. This is not a fortnight house

146
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:21,299
because if I was building it like a fortnight house, I'd be doing this. OK, so I want to let's

147
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:28,380
make a fake living room. TV is going to go here. It's the only logical place for it. This house is

148
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:34,039
pretty small. You go into the front door. You need a little kitchen. This is going to be a kitchen.

149
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,829
What's this? This is like another weird room. This room is just why they all have a why does

150
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:52,119
every room in this house have a back entrance to the backyard? That's kind of weird, right?

151
00:23:52,119 --> 00:24:06,789
I don't like that. I can't put that down here. Why can I not put that down to destroy this? I

152
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:17,420
can't destroy this either. So I'm just going to put a wall here and then I'll paint like I'll paint

153
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:28,390
just outside to be painted. It's fine. There was a spoiler for House Flipper doesn't even have a plot

154
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:38,170
more of a mystic quest. Thanks again. Five more six more subs actually. No joke. Make your dream

155
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:48,500
house. I don't think I could even do that, though. I thought about it even more last night. My dream

156
00:24:48,500 --> 00:25:03,579
house is just a room, a decent toilet and a nice bed and a door that works in locks. I'm pretty

157
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:13,509
simple. It's like, well, I can't wait to do like a huge decoration upstairs. I don't upstairs may

158
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:18,869
as well. Downstairs may as well not even exist. Do I have a room with a toilet next to me? A bed

159
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:29,750
is like a 70 inch TV with like all the consoles plugged in. And yeah, I'm good. That's much better.

160
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:41,140
This is like an actual room. Need curtains here. What? Wait, I need what color? That's prison.

161
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:51,079
Um, that's not what. OK, what prison do you know that each prison cell has a 70 inch TV

162
00:25:51,079 --> 00:26:10,259
in every console plugged in? You're going to go to gamer jail. You dream, dream, solitary confinement.

163
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:25,190
No. All right. I need to focus on my dream house. This is going to be up here. There's a room here.

164
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:32,549
I need to get a big picture here of this. You know, this can stay. This could just stay open.

165
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:44,759
Like, should there be signs up here that's like, yep, like you fucked up. Nothing in here, idiot.

166
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:54,710
And I like paint on the walls that says like nothing to steal. Stupid. Oh, right. You couldn't

167
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:10,470
find the right house to steal from, huh? And then have like this door just be blocked. Custom paint

168
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:17,029
images. Yeah, yeah, I like that. I like that. Have the dummy house on top of the real house.

169
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:22,259
And I'm going to put like a bunch of diamonds and shit in here. And this room is going to be the

170
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:29,690
pre room to my actual house. And I'm going to put like a sign up here that just is like toxic,

171
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:40,380
fucking toxic waste or like electrified room. Do not touch handle. And to really push this,

172
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,059
to make sure nobody like actual. Oh yeah, bullshit. I'm knocking over a fucking toxic

173
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:51,259
waste barrel right here. So they're like, wait, what's that? Holy shit, dude. This is a bad idea.

174
00:27:51,259 --> 00:28:06,099
Go back upstairs. Do not open door. We'll break a gas line. OK, yeah. Go, go, go. We're going to

175
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:14,339
have like a bunch of like dumb. OK, I'm ready. This is this goes downstairs. OK, should I do

176
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:27,660
the fake house first or should I do the real house first? Absolute paranoid house. Fake house first.

177
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:33,670
Traps all over it. OK, yeah. So this house is going to this room is going to be like a standard

178
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:42,250
bedroom. We're going to get what's what's like the cheapest paint. OK, well, forest mist is the

179
00:28:42,250 --> 00:29:04,180
cheapest paint. But why did you say, of course I do. I thought I thought I told you guys that links

180
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:14,809
we were links were banned. Thanks for the fully rigged Vista slime. Oh, no, I saw this. I saw this.

181
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:23,880
You don't know anybody in your whole life. I feel like I feel like I would want more than one.

182
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:44,980
That's fucking awesome, though. I think there should be like a whole streamer slime family

183
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:54,380
and they like switch off who's going to stream today because what I think when I think of like

184
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:01,880
the mainstreamer, which is like slime, like just slime dad, I mean, I'm thinking of like

185
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,740
Slimer just like a disgusting Slimer that looks like he's barely functioning, like he's barely

186
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:35,140
able to even stay upright. Here we go. Oh, there we go. Look at this room. Wait, fan links.

187
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:44,180
I've thought about it. I've thought about it. Thank you, DJ on the beat. Thanks for the five

188
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:52,420
community subs. Thank you. Don't do it. I thought about it. You know, when people if you start to

189
00:30:53,140 --> 00:31:03,079
overstay your link privileges. All right, what's something what's like looks OK.

190
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:11,289
I mean, we need something that has to look good enough. Right. This is cheap.

191
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:27,609
Porcelain. Oh, no. Fifty dollars to one. Fifty bucks from Ellis. Thank you, Ellis,

192
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:39,180
in there for the five thousand bits. Thank you. Ellis is in there. Oh, it's time. Is it time to

193
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:50,420
ban links? Oh, they're. Oh, they're doing it. Oh, they're doing it. Thank you, Ellis. Seriously,

194
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:57,819
you're a legend. I've never donated before. This is for years of content. Thank you, man.

195
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:03,509
Completely not necessary to give me that amount of money, but I appreciate it nonetheless.

196
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,849
Um, stop. Stop spamming my link. All right, let's go with, um,

197
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:27,450
should I name one of the rooms like expensive shit and this? Oh, no, it's time to do it.

198
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:34,569
We got I think we got to close links today. All it takes is you know how they say all it takes is

199
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:40,569
one person. Well, no, all it takes is like 400 people. This is be spamming links. And that's

200
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:55,190
when you get my attention. OK, somebody just write, let's go spam. No, what? No, stay. Don't

201
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:09,349
go anywhere. Don't go. Stay. Stay and then hang out. This looks good. God damn it. But it's I.

202
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:32,579
Oh, I do the same. I'm so boring. No. Wait, it's the same. Is it the same? Shit. It's really close.

203
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:51,619
OK, hold on. It's got to be something else. Floor rugs. No floor panels. It's a toilet house. No,

204
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:59,130
we're going to do, um, blue fitted carpet. That's better. Better, better, better, better,

205
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:13,110
better, better. OK. And the walls are changing that. God damn it. I don't know. I can't get

206
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:20,659
the doctor's office out of my mind. I don't. Should I do this? Change the walls. Jeans. Make

207
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:28,920
a jeans house. Denim ground. It's not denim. Look, you toss a rug on here and it's going to be

208
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,460
just fine. Watch this. Ready? Just toss. Look at this. Check this out. You toss a rug on here.

209
00:34:40,650 --> 00:35:04,760
Look at that. It's changed the room entirely. It's a completely different room now. There.

210
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,079
I have made I've changed the room completely. I put a fucking expensive ass chandelier sphere

211
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:17,800
atom thing. Look at that. I want to see the before and after. And then a painting right here,

212
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:36,820
too. These walls are terrible. OK, we just need just like cheap a pet desk.

213
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:46,469
Why? What do you mean a pet desk? This actually is a desk for a dog or something. This is weird.

214
00:35:46,469 --> 00:36:06,409
It's tiny. No, that's too small. Furniture. I need. Yeah, like, here we go. Bambino.

215
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,570
Should this be like a fake? This is going to be a fake kid's room.

216
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:22,360
No, there's nothing to steal. Germa desk. Germa desk. Germa desk. Yeah.

217
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:43,769
What is this? It's a crib. No, I want a bed. Here we are. One of these or.

218
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:54,969
Wait, is this a bed up top? It is. Holy shit. This is awesome. OK, this is my favorite kind

219
00:36:54,969 --> 00:37:05,349
of bunk bed because it's a bunk bed without the other asshole underneath you. Perfect.

220
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:10,010
You know, I almost wish this was reversed. I don't want my bed this close to the ceiling,

221
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:17,530
but I would like sit up there. I don't care about that. I want to like climb up to my desk

222
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:25,849
and sleep down here. That would be cool if you climb up and there's like a platform and you

223
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:32,949
sit up here. I think that would be pretty. I want to be I don't I want to be closer to the ground.

224
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:39,780
I don't want to be sleeping up here. It freaks me out. No, not gray. All right. Blue.

225
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,130
We're going to go with the blue. The blue looks good, especially in a house that's gray with.

226
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:54,760
There we go. Perfect. OK, this just encompasses everything I told you guys I wanted in a house.

227
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:02,300
This is really all I need. You ready? You have a place to sleep up top right there.

228
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,610
You have a place to do your work right there. You just need a chair. You've got exercise.

229
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:17,539
You can climb up and down that thing like 10 times. You have the storage shoes, clothes.

230
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:20,900
You have a toilet. You could you could you could just piss in that.

231
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,860
Just have a hole in the ground. All right. There's your shoes and your clothes.

232
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,420
And you can slide that and there's like a little there's a hole in the ground.

233
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,170
You can just pee into it. It's a toilet. And just give me a TV right there.

234
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:45,960
Right in that big rectangle in the middle. It's perfect. TV right here.

235
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,369
And you just like go in here and sit and watch. What would a kitchen be?

236
00:38:54,659 --> 00:39:00,389
You just order McDonald's every day. You know who cooks. What do you mean?

237
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:13,610
It's bad placement. Yeah, it kind of is. That's a little better.

238
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:24,710
No, it's not. It needs to be like a little bit. What about the closet?

239
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:34,170
Oh, fuck. Yeah, it needs to. OK, where do I put my hamster hotel?

240
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,449
The thing that I want so badly, I can't put it anywhere. It doesn't fit here.

241
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:56,039
Here? I guess it fits right here. Walk in the window. But you know, whatever.

242
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,130
Should I go then? Maybe that goes in another room.

243
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:11,590
I know a lot of you guys are talking a lot of some talking some serious shit right now.

244
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:19,130
But if you woke up and you kind of like went to the bathroom and you opened up a door and there was

245
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,650
like a McDonald's play place in one of the behind one of the doors in your house,

246
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,119
you don't think that you would go in there and just fuck around all the time?

247
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,929
Of course you would. Hamster. Yeah, the hamster house.

248
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:41,690
Imagine if you could go into a person sized hamster wheel and just sprint around your house

249
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:49,460
and smash the fuck into walls and you'd be fine. You just sprint in this bubble

250
00:40:49,460 --> 00:41:02,840
and could just go anywhere. Just run into stuff that's lying. Oh, I know. OK, that's fine.

251
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,619
Now let's go with I want to put I want to put blinds on there, but not blinds. I hate blinds.

252
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:17,210
I want like just regular curtains, a multiple narrow curtain there and we can make this room

253
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:27,880
pop. I had a little bit of orange. It needs to be bigger than that.

254
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:46,920
It needs to be wide curtain, multiple short wide curtain. What's wrong with that? The bed in the

255
00:41:46,920 --> 00:42:19,000
way. Where are the curtains? Oh, perfect. I just I only have this in here because I want it,

256
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:35,719
not because it makes sense in the room. Not big enough. All right, I can fix that.

257
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:52,500
This is fixable. Honey, we've got to take the wall down so I can fit my hamster bed.

258
00:42:52,500 --> 00:43:01,690
Um, I can't can we just get a regular mattress that we know. Excuse me. You did not say

259
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:37,820
McDonald's play place. OK, move the door. That's too late. This room just got much bigger.

260
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:47,480
Oops. I swung and hit the wrong part of the house. You never do your own project.

261
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:58,280
This is one of those scenarios where it's just like, OK, let's start our project.

262
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:06,940
Here we go. We've got our tools. Cut to the ambulance. Cut to in the in the emergency room

263
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:21,690
where I'm like on like five different machines. He's flatlining. OK, this has to be like this,

264
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:34,699
though. Cut to the cut to a funeral. Well, does that have the same weight? Because how did he die?

265
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:41,860
We don't know. That could be like years in the future. If you cut to the funeral of the guy,

266
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:47,340
it's like, oh, no, he died. And then it goes back to their house. And what an amazing looking

267
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:52,489
incredible project that they did. By the way, this is the funeral is like from two or three years

268
00:44:52,489 --> 00:45:02,889
after they completed this awesome project that you got to have context there. I don't think you

269
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:16,789
cut to the funeral. Irma has died of construction project. All right, here we go. Perfect. Now,

270
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:33,369
this room becomes longer like this. Trust yourself, man. Don't fucking listen to what anybody says.

271
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,460
Do you do it like this? Yeah, you did this. Nobody don't listen to fucking anybody.

272
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,619
Oh, and you can't fucking do it like this. I can fucking do it.

273
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:47,320
See, don't let anybody tell you can't do that. Can't do it because it's too close to the

274
00:45:47,320 --> 00:46:04,360
window. It's all right. I can make this a corner. This is going to be a corner that people do that,

275
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:45,780
right? Disgusting. This is not disgusting. See, problem completely solved there. Oh, looks actually

276
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:57,559
really good. Cracks, cracks, lol. You guys have any idea what's surrounding you in your house

277
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,800
right now? You know how many cracks, how many broken like pieces of wood are just surrounding

278
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,139
you? You know how many dead animals are surrounding you right now? Right now, there are probably like

279
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:15,699
10 different dead bugs and animals surrounding you in your walls. There's a squirrel that's

280
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:19,800
dead in your wall. That's a skeleton that's been there for probably 45 years and it's

281
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:28,170
less than five feet, probably away from your face. So crack in the wall that I'm covering up.

282
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:54,250
Oh, it's not a big problem to me. How do you know that? Look it up. You put them in there.

283
00:47:54,730 --> 00:48:03,699
How do you put something in a wall? So you're telling me that you think that you knock apart,

284
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:13,699
you go cut into your drywall and place an object in there and then put the drywall back up. Well,

285
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:23,530
for what reason? I just open up the drywall and dump like 5,000 crickets in there and then seal it.

286
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:29,139
Yeah, that's right. That's what I did today. Why did you do that? I don't know.

287
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:40,409
Shit! Is it big enough? All right, you can reach it. It's not big enough. It's not big enough.

288
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:47,239
Wait, can I turn the other way? You're fine. You're fine. You can fit in here. Just only open this

289
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:53,239
one and then duck and then kind of get your body inside of it and then and then get your clothes.

290
00:48:53,239 --> 00:49:02,739
You have to close this one first and then leave. It's fine. The person using this is going to be

291
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:13,159
like this tall anyways. Yeah, you. Yeah. Wait, get that out of here. Can I take this down and

292
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:21,030
just go one more? I can do it now. I'm going to fix this. This is my dream house. What are

293
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:38,150
you talking about? This is my dream fake house above my real dream house. OK, so right here is

294
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:58,630
where I can safely open this. We're good. Close it up. Perfect. There we go. I don't fucking listen

295
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:06,380
to anybody. You can't do that. You can't. What are you doing? You're an idiot. Shut up. I can

296
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,539
fucking do it. I can do whatever I want. I'm not going to tell you anything like that ever again.

297
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:26,309
I'm not listening to anybody. Hey, it worked. What was he talking to? Oh, OK, I need paint.

298
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:31,269
We're doing a better paint, too. I want something nicer than this. Not I don't want it too dark,

299
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:56,360
though. No grays. Get away from the gray ink mist. Just just black every room. It's blue like

300
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:11,340
an Azure Bliss or a sleep. I think sleepy blue, baby blue. Let's try sleepy blue. I want to get

301
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:31,780
this right. Wait a minute here. Hold on. Hold on a minute here. A minute here. Hold on a minute

302
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:42,360
here. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three. Hold on. Wait a minute here. One, two,

303
00:51:42,360 --> 00:52:06,679
three, four, one, two, three, four, five. What's it? What color is this? Forest mist, right? OK,

304
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:24,730
one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Nice. Then that means

305
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:31,610
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

306
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:40,409
fifteen. So we need one here or up there. I paint it. What's wrong with this?

307
00:52:45,380 --> 00:53:05,320
And I want like a green too or something. What looks better? Green. I need to see what this

308
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,920
looks like. Jerma, Jerma, hurry up. No, I'm making my dream fucking fake house. OK,

309
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:31,480
it's terrible. This is why I can't design anything. I like don't get it. My design philosophy is put

310
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:36,420
different color line in here. I don't know. That's why everything's gray. That's why all

311
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:46,889
my floors are gray. All my everything in my whole house is gray. I don't understand. I don't get it.

312
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:54,980
Should I do like a line, line, line or like one wall should be? Hold on. What if I do one whole

313
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:28,869
wall? OK, that looks all right. Do all blue. That's not too much, though. Oh, then I know

314
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:46,860
we can put little cloud artwork all over here. Yeah. Yeah. Like every baby boy's room in America.

315
00:54:49,219 --> 00:55:06,630
Cloud, cloud, cloud, rainbow, frog, cloud, cloud, cloud, rainbow, frog.

316
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:31,610
Gaming. I get rid of this. It's going to it's going to pee through the walls here. All right.

317
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:39,579
Thank you. This is not disgusting. Disgust. This is OK. If you think this is disgusting,

318
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:45,179
then then you thought your room was disgusting. This is what it looked like. This is what your

319
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:55,130
room looked like when you were like 12. OK, this is what your room looked like. No, it didn't. Yes,

320
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:01,619
it did. When you were like under the age of seven, you had this room, this room right here.

321
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:15,349
What about dinosaurs? Yeah, we're going to put like dinosaur action figures on here. No, they better

322
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:22,119
not be expensive. Whatever they are, they better be cheap. Oh, wait, you know, you guys talk about

323
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:28,630
the stealing furniture. You can't deal this. It's just not it's bolted to the ground. It doesn't

324
00:56:28,630 --> 00:57:00,309
come up, hinge on the floor. Hmm. That'd be cheap. Yeah, it better be cheap. Put concrete in here.

325
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:09,340
Bolted furniture is in prisons. No, it's not. It's in people who want to make sure that their

326
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:23,900
stuff is secure. It doesn't move. I open and close these. Oh, you can't close and open these.

327
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:39,110
All right. Now we need. OK, installations vent grill. Yeah. No, no, no. Wait a minute. Wait a

328
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:42,389
minute. We're not we don't give a shit about like giving and putting AC or heat up here.

329
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:56,539
This is not even real. No air in here. Nobody's going to be sleeping in here. This is a fake

330
00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:01,900
dream house. All right. Here we go. This is perfect. Who the fuck is going to steal this?

331
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,860
It's twenty twenty, dude. You're going to you're not going to pick this up.

332
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:22,949
You can't sell this electronic equipment. No, no cool speakers. We're going to this is going to be

333
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:27,349
this. We're going to have so much such a wow mini fridge downstairs, a router,

334
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:33,480
a bunch of consoles and stuff. Oh, this is the real house is going to be awesome.

335
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:44,309
And none of this belongs in this room. TV remote microwave.

336
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:47,590
Should there be a microwave in this kid's room?

337
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:05,210
No, it's not even a person's room, though. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A DVD player.

338
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:12,710
This is a perfect, perfect fake Ikea room where you lean over here and you go, oh,

339
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:17,989
and you touch this and it's hollow and it's like, boom, boom, boom. Oh, shit. Oh, this is not real.

340
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:29,110
OK, if you you come in here. All right, here we go. I got I got I got I got two minutes.

341
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:33,800
I got to figure out what I want to steal this house. I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. What's in this room?

342
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:40,519
OK, we got fucking nothing. DVD player. I got to get the fuck. I have to get out of the house now.

343
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:46,739
DVD player. No, I'm like this house sucks. Wrong one. Who uses a DVD player in 2020?

344
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:58,550
This house sucks. OK, what are the like just like fake like plastic Ikea furniture thing can we do

345
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:07,800
here? Decorations. Now, here's the thing. Should I make it like a game for them? Should there be

346
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:13,269
like a two like two hundred thousand dollar painting like hidden in all of the bullshit?

347
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:30,460
All right, hold on pictures and paintings. Put it somewhere like random. Like there's no reason why

348
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:35,619
you would care to look over here. OK, yeah, here's what I'm going to have with it. This is the plan.

349
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:40,500
I'm going to put like a two hundred thousand dollar painting behind the wicked shitty stove,

350
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:45,460
like down here. So all you need to do is just move the plastic Ikea furniture and it's like,

351
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:53,699
holy shit, there's a Mona Lisa back here. And you got to give them at least something. I mean,

352
01:00:53,699 --> 01:01:03,639
I'll have like five of those downstairs. Bathroom. There's no reason for a bathroom up here.

353
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,750
Well, what would what would there be a bathroom up here for? It's not a real house.

354
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:17,139
OK, imagine coming into somebody's house and you only have like a few minutes.

355
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:24,090
You're running around like, OK, what am I going to steal? OK, that's just this.

356
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:33,530
Where's the bathroom? You would question everything. This is that. Yeah, somebody just

357
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:40,099
said this is a game show house. This is a house that's made. This is set and exactly. Yeah. But

358
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:47,289
why would there be a functioning toilet up here? There's no reason to have a functioning toilet.

359
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:54,980
This is going to be another bedroom or like a closet or something. We're not done here yet,

360
01:01:54,980 --> 01:02:18,380
though. Use the toilet backstage. Shit, I spit everywhere. Put kitty litter in the corner.

361
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:23,260
Yeah, that's not a bad idea. If I can do it, I'll put like 10 litter boxes over here.

362
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:29,690
So you come and you go, oh, there's a lot of cats in here. A lot of cats in this house.

363
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:33,539
But where are they, though? Where are the cats? How come they're nowhere?

364
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:37,289
Where then? Why are there no cats? Paint the top of the windows.

365
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:48,059
I knew somebody was going to be like, this is all right. Let's go. You get the vision.

366
01:02:48,780 --> 01:03:06,730
Get the vision. Good. What was it called? Sleepy Blue. You're making a crack then.

367
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:16,039
No, this is a fake house upstairs and then the real house is downstairs, which I guess could be

368
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:23,989
a front for a drug operation. Now that I think about it. Yes, you, I guess like,

369
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:39,510
what's going on here? Nothing. Yeah, nothing. Actually, you're right. What's going on downstairs?

370
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:47,449
That's what the fake room for it before the real room is for. This is going to be a bunch of boxes

371
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:59,780
and storage as I'm five steps ahead of you. That looks good. Always the same voice.

372
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:04,980
Don't you get it? Whenever I'm talking about somebody that's not me, they either sound like

373
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,780
this. They sound like this. Or they sound like this. There's only three other people that I've

374
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:26,969
referenced. It's always the same three people. That's the easiest way for me to differentiate

375
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:33,139
that it's not me talking. Because if I go, think about that, right? If I don't make some type of

376
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:37,300
differential voice to who I'm talking, I'm a different person speaking, then me saying this.

377
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:44,010
Yeah. Yeah. The paint looks good. Look at that paint. Yeah. Okay. Good job with that paint.

378
01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:49,530
Hey, welcome to the drug den. I do drugs downstairs. Hey, officer. Yeah, come on in.

379
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,820
Yeah, go. Don't look downstairs though. There's drugs everywhere down there.

380
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:58,780
Oh, that's the storage. Just storage down there. You understand how that doesn't work now?

381
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:07,880
That's just me saying that. It has to be somebody else. It can't be me. All right,

382
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:19,610
that room is pretty good. Maybe another decoration. It's just me saying it. Is that part of the stream

383
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:37,639
or is that a cry for help? See, you get it now. No, it's not that. It's the voice. It's the other

384
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:45,019
voice doing it. I can push all of my insecurities through the other voice. I'm just sitting here

385
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:53,820
watching the stream with you guys. Gas mask. All right, let's go with furniture.

386
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:10,920
I need a chair in here. Yeah, this is like wooden. This is a fucking wood chair. It's a little small,

387
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:29,349
but it's fine. I need to have something else. Yeah, get a chair from like the 1400s.

388
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:41,719
Just wood. Just hard, painful wood. Why do they still make chairs out of wood? Am I crazy for

389
01:06:41,719 --> 01:06:48,420
saying this? Everybody puts a pad on their chairs if they made it a wood. Why even make them out of

390
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:54,900
wood? Why not make them out of like silicone and like have the legs be wood? Why do we have to sit

391
01:06:54,900 --> 01:07:10,179
on wood still? I don't understand. It's easy to make. It's cheap. Wood looks good. I guess.

392
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:20,519
This sucks to sit on. Okay, how about for support, you adult. I'm saying the wood,

393
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:26,940
you can keep this. Yeah, but sitting on wood sucks. You don't want to sit in this for more than like

394
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:39,579
10 minutes. Is there going to be a washing machine up here? And get cushions. Yeah, then why not just

395
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:48,059
have like a cushioned thing that you actually sit on? Oh, here we go. This is perfect. Just a fucking

396
01:07:48,139 --> 01:08:05,980
plastic recycling bin. There's a million chairs like that. Yeah, I know there's options,

397
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:20,789
but at the end of the day, like sitting on wood hurts as a poop bucket. Where's the plaster?

398
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:43,060
You need a thicker butt. Fix the door. That can wait. I don't even know what you're talking about.

399
01:08:43,699 --> 01:08:59,100
That's it for plaster, right? Yep. Now outlets. What's the point? I almost want to take this door

400
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:09,399
out because the door means you can go in there. No, that's more suspicious that way. Okay, so I'm

401
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:14,729
going to put what does this is the garage leading to the door that leads to the real house. Let's

402
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:22,779
figure out what we're going to do here. This is bedroom one. Let's go decorations or what about

403
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:36,760
equipment? No toilet paper. No, no reason. Accessories. This is stealable. I don't want

404
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:48,220
it in here. Just spoons. No one's going to steal utensils. Put a tent in here. No,

405
01:09:49,180 --> 01:10:06,890
put a tent in the house. Hold on. Jar full of manna. Okay, this is fake fruit. Perfect. That's

406
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:19,399
perfect for our kitchen. Where's that going to be? Right here, right? Yeah. What happened to the

407
01:10:19,399 --> 01:10:25,720
mirror maze? I had like a mental breakdown playing the mirror house yesterday and had a lot to do

408
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:30,760
with it. The Luigi's Mansion music just got wicked fucked up. It was messing with me. I had to stop.

409
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:43,829
I had to get out. Anything else I want in here? It's in this room particularly. These are going

410
01:10:43,829 --> 01:11:12,010
to be in every room. Decorations maybe. Plants. No. Nah. Nah. Ikea? Firewood in here? No, no, no,

411
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:20,630
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's just firewood down here.

412
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:48,180
There's nothing down here. This is like firewood. There's nothing in here. I have to do a different

413
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:59,500
variety though. I don't want it to look like Minecraft. Put a gas stove on the front lawn

414
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:09,819
to scare off the thieves. No, a gas stove on the front lawn means I'll probably be on an episode

415
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:27,659
of Hoarders in a few weeks. That's what that means. All right, let's do the other variant.

416
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:40,649
There's got to be enough space that I can walk through here though. Okay, this plenty,

417
01:12:40,649 --> 01:12:54,409
this plenty space. Well then upstairs has to be a like a shitty wood stove. There's a lot of firewood

418
01:12:54,970 --> 01:13:11,029
put on new music. Okay, somebody recommend something that's not Luigi's Mansion? Not really.

419
01:13:13,449 --> 01:13:19,989
Is this not a lot of wood? I guess maybe not. Okay, those of you that have used, I've never

420
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:26,279
used a wood burning stove or anything. How much, how long would you be able to heat your house

421
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:39,380
with this much wood? Not very long. Maybe a couple of hours. A few hours. Hour, a couple

422
01:13:39,380 --> 01:14:11,500
hours. Damn, really? Holy shit. That doesn't seem like very long at all. Two days. Wait,

423
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:18,890
is that you kidding? Or is it what I, who said what? It's not supposed to be symmetrical.

424
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:25,260
If it was, it would look weird if it was symmetrical. This is stacked wood.

425
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:45,800
It would be two to three days. Okay, so I was just, am I taking a picture? Okay, no, I don't want the

426
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:55,989
camera. I want variant one. Close to your Instagram. All right, one more layer. Just like a little bit

427
01:14:55,989 --> 01:15:11,779
kind of tethered down a little. Layered a little, you know what I'm saying? This is probably the

428
01:15:11,779 --> 01:15:26,390
most thought I've put into the whole house. Okay, good. That looks good. That's like if you got

429
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:31,270
firewood down here. Did I put the wood stove down here? Would that make sense? Or does it have to be

430
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:44,060
on the same layer? All right, don't open that door. I slammed a water before I started playing.

431
01:15:44,779 --> 01:18:23,909
So that water is on its way out. So I got to be right back. Come on, guys, if we can convince

432
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:29,369
him to play 100 gecks, just keep spamming 100 gecks or riot. Well, now I know what I'm not

433
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:56,300
going to play ever. Welcome back to the stream, everybody. It's me, Jabba that I vied. Slime, slime,

434
01:18:56,300 --> 01:19:02,229
everyone riot, everyone riot. If you could do me a favor and stop rioting, that would be awesome.

435
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:10,359
I would be so good on radio. You all know it. Streaming, like streaming, if it doesn't work out,

436
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:14,789
I'm just going to go to the radio station. I'm just going to be like, can I have an interview?

437
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:25,930
Are you sure? Do you apply through our website portal? No. Okay, I guess we have a position open.

438
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:32,060
Come sit down. Okay, I will. So can you tell me about yourself a little? Of course I can.

439
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:40,359
I grew up in Massachusetts in a small town called Boston. Okay. What are you interested in? Well,

440
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:46,420
I'll tell you. I love talking. I love talking to people. I'm a people person. You need somebody

441
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:53,060
to read the news. I'm that guy. I also like video games. I grew up on them my entire life.

442
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:03,720
Okay. Can you would just just us in the room here together? I can't turn it off. Let me do my thing.

443
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:20,710
Okay. Change the channel. Make, please, please make a booker house. I'm going to have to

444
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:30,899
respectfully decline. And by the way, if you're going to take 95, I would avoid it. Just keep that.

445
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:39,060
You know how awesome that would be? Just reading like where like the traffic is. I would be so

446
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:45,140
good at that. You're going to have to find a way around through the rotary on Second Street. And

447
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:59,029
by the way, if you be careful, there is a crash in an accident on I-95. I would kill it. And I

448
01:20:59,029 --> 01:21:06,300
would just throw shit in there that like somebody would hear. Make sure you take the rotary.

449
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:15,930
Wait, I'm fired. I got fired. The door rips open. You fucked up a word. You're fired. Hold on. Let

450
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:23,659
me do it again. Just take the rotary on Second Street. Come on, Gwen. Coming up next, we have

451
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:28,979
the news by Jake Stevenson. He's coming up here. And one of you guys would be like, what? Hold

452
01:21:28,979 --> 01:21:37,319
the fuck on. What did he just? Who's that? All right. Stop walking in circles and play. I've

453
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:48,760
stopped this. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Don't do it. Don't say toy boat. Toy boat, toy boat,

454
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:53,239
toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Oh yeah. He still can do it. I could

455
01:21:53,239 --> 01:22:02,500
fucking read the weather. If you gave me a script, I'll do it. What's happening? Okay. Let's go. I

456
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:18,819
needed the second room. This room is done. Here's kitchen, all wood, a wooden sink.

457
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:32,439
This is just like construction house. I don't know what happened over there, but I'll fix it later.

458
01:22:32,439 --> 01:22:52,020
Fuck this. This should be made out of silicone. Everything should be made out of silicone.

459
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:10,789
Okay. Cabinet. What do we got for cabinets? We got the wood. Yeah. Jesus. This. Okay. I know

460
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:31,340
how like wooden cabinets look good, but these don't. This is a really tall.

461
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:44,600
Where are the long cabinets? Too tall for you. That's too tall for anybody. This is like,

462
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:52,260
it's like, that's 11 feet tall. You would have trouble reaching that. Let's do a tiered system.

463
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:03,420
Oh shit. All right. Nice. And then we have like a painting up there. Nice.

464
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:23,859
Too high, too low, too high, too low. Okay. I need the kitchen. Okay. Door cabinet,

465
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:32,199
single door cabinet. Where's the wooden corner cabinet? Wooden corner left,

466
01:24:32,199 --> 01:25:09,479
wooden double door. Here we go. Why does this look crooked? Is the wall crooked? Oh no. Right. Shit.

467
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:29,539
I can't do that. Try it. What's the ride for? What are you talking about? I hate the way that

468
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:35,289
looks. What if I get rid of this? What is it? What's over there? I hate how that looks. I

469
01:25:35,289 --> 01:25:45,510
don't like that little thing sticking out. It's pissing me off. Turn off slow mode. Why would

470
01:25:45,510 --> 01:26:03,000
I turn off slow mode? There's like some 7,000 people here. Turn off slow mode. I hate this. I

471
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:17,770
know I've done this like three times already, but I don't like how this looks. I have the solution.

472
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:33,289
Don't worry. Turn on fast mode. That's just no restrictions. I have the solution. The solution

473
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:58,279
is here. There we go. And then this wall just needs to be built this way. Why? Is that good?

474
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:10,760
Yes. This legit looks like a lot of fun. Yeah, it is. We said this yesterday. We talked about

475
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:19,109
it yesterday. This is like one of my favorite games. It just exists in its own fun world.

476
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:28,119
I wish there was a little bit more freedom. I wish there was more freedom. If I could

477
01:27:29,939 --> 01:27:36,550
delete stuff on the outside, if you could make the actual house, if I want to take down this

478
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:40,789
wall and remove these windows, if I want to get rid of a staircase or put a staircase in,

479
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:50,180
you're talking about now you're at a 10. That's how you get to a 10. Just play The Sims. It's

480
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:54,979
not the same. It's not the same. This is first person like home decoration. It's not like in a

481
01:27:54,979 --> 01:28:06,579
cartoon universe. This is realistic graphics, realistic game. It's not cartoon sim world.

482
01:28:06,579 --> 01:28:13,850
So Minecraft. Minecraft is not... No, what are you talking about? I would be careful here.

483
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:18,569
Fried lightly here, guys. You're talking shit about potentially my favorite game ever.

484
01:28:18,569 --> 01:28:46,579
I would choose your words more carefully. How's that? That's better. Super blue? No,

485
01:28:46,579 --> 01:29:03,609
not super blue. That's super frog. Sleepy blue. Punching. Unfair. Mr. Albliston, I didn't see it.

486
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:16,260
There, that's so much better. Now it doesn't look disgusting from this side. No, it doesn't

487
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:28,460
look disgusting. Why do I keep doing this? It doesn't work every time. Why do I keep doing

488
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:39,989
this? Why do I do that? It doesn't work every single time. But now this is just like a wall

489
01:29:39,989 --> 01:29:56,329
here. This has to move. This has got to move down. That sink's got to be in the right spot,

490
01:29:56,329 --> 01:30:16,180
though. I don't like the sink over there. Move sleepy blue in. Albliston is in there.

491
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:32,260
I don't know what that is. Are you writing that? This has to move. I need this to be right there.

492
01:30:36,899 --> 01:30:44,619
Fake SpongeBob fan. Sorry, I can't recall... Guys, I cannot recall every piece of media I have ever

493
01:30:44,619 --> 01:30:59,590
seen. This has got to come in, but I made it like this so this could fit. All right, moving... Okay,

494
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:05,590
I'm taking the advice that that guy said like an hour and a half ago. Move wall. No, move door.

495
01:31:06,149 --> 01:31:21,539
Move the window. I can't move the windows. They're locked in place. You make me able to move

496
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:41,770
windows and move staircases and take out exterior walls? Game's a 10. Okay, I need this. Okay,

497
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:49,930
front door. No, not a front door. We need a... Here, internal white, just internal white door.

498
01:31:55,399 --> 01:32:05,819
Perfect. There we go. Okay, excellent. I always have been an hour and a half and he's done nothing.

499
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:11,420
Welcome to the game. That's kind of the whole game. The whole game is just kind of do nothing

500
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:17,539
for four to ten hours and then sometimes look back and go, oh yeah, that paint looks nice.

501
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:24,979
That's better. All right, now I can move this forward a little and then this wall...

502
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:56,329
Home designing is hard. Oh, music. Right, right. Listen to your viewers. Better. This comes forward

503
01:32:57,130 --> 01:33:11,960
like this. All right, this wall then comes in. What happens if I break this?

504
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:33,369
It's okay. I'll pick it up later. Somebody scratches all over these.

505
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:46,890
Why does it look like you ran over my cabinets with a car? Well, they fell. One of them fell

506
01:33:46,890 --> 01:34:00,619
in the truck. It must have been a truck problem. I didn't do anything. I wonder how much shit

507
01:34:00,619 --> 01:34:07,460
actually happens with instruction that you just never know. You know in the beginning of

508
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:12,420
Ace Ventura when Jim Carrey is literally just drop kicking that guy's package all over the whole

509
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:19,189
fucking entire apartment complex. How many times does that happen? How many times do they just

510
01:34:19,189 --> 01:34:24,260
blow a wall out with a hammer for fun and like destroy somebody's cabinets and then go, oh shit,

511
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:43,449
we gotta patch that back up. But it happens quite frequently. All right, is that better?

512
01:34:43,449 --> 01:34:52,970
Did I fix it finally? Because then this goes... Did I not do anything? No, no, I got it. I got

513
01:34:53,449 --> 01:35:20,359
this one. And then I can still make it in here. Good. This has to move a little bit. Remove the

514
01:35:20,359 --> 01:35:24,680
walls. No, I can't. Every single house I've ever made in this game has been just an open floor

515
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:35,270
plan. Open floor plan is just translated into I don't actually know what I should do. So just

516
01:35:35,270 --> 01:36:01,699
remove all of it. Splatoon 2 OST for fuck's sake. Oh my God. Oh my goodness. Splatoon 2 OST.

517
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:15,140
Oh, actually, this is kind of cool. I like when they go...

518
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:37,260
If I had practiced in the bathtub, I would get it. Is there a song in this that's like...

519
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:45,289
I think there is, right? Where it goes... What does it do? It's this one. That's the one I'm

520
01:36:45,289 --> 01:37:00,119
thinking of. I was gonna say this is one of the lyrics. Am I making progress? I feel like I'm

521
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:04,760
just Indiana Jones-ing this room. I'm just like squishing it. I'm slowly moving the walls in.

522
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:21,750
Is this doing anything? Is this gonna fix my problem? Oh, yeah, this is the song. I want this

523
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:57,659
played at my fucking funeral. Excuse me. There is no... I'm about to skip this one. Is this even

524
01:37:57,659 --> 01:38:03,420
a good soundtrack? It doesn't have that song. That's a different track. It better be on here.

525
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:26,039
I'm skipping it. That's fine. Looks good. This looks like I just moved in. Throw my boxes.

526
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:29,819
All right. Put this shit back. I need to paint it. What color is the kitchen gonna be?

527
01:38:40,659 --> 01:38:50,149
Copper coin? Light cream? Mustard yellow? Sunny D orange? Oh, that's Sunny D orange.

528
01:38:57,609 --> 01:39:30,409
Sunny D. The orange juice enema. Why'd you say that? Oh, fuck. Usually I can blame this on

529
01:39:30,409 --> 01:39:40,579
somebody. In a typical fashion, I can just blame someone in the chat for that. None of you said

530
01:39:40,579 --> 01:39:50,119
that, though. I did. Hmm. Never been in this position before. That has never happened. Oh,

531
01:39:50,119 --> 01:40:11,079
no. Sorry about that one. I guess. Put it down. What are you doing? Put this down.

532
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:41,819
These are in such stupid places. I hate it already. What are you saying? This music is bad.

533
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:53,590
Oh, at least somebody is gonna take the rock throwing away from my house for a change.

534
01:40:54,149 --> 01:41:13,640
I didn't say that. Is this a hundred gecks? Sure. Maybe. Platoon music sounds good for

535
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:35,079
about three minutes. I don't know. Does it? Does this be flush? What do you guys think? Flush? Oh,

536
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:45,380
but no. How am I gonna wash my hands and look at the kids outside? No, I hate it. Change it.

537
01:41:45,380 --> 01:42:03,909
There. Now I can see my children playing. I mean, what? I mean, what? Like, you sit in here,

538
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:08,869
you're like the dad or the mom or whatever, and you're gonna wash. The kids are playing outside,

539
01:42:08,869 --> 01:42:15,350
and you can just watch them from doing the dishes or something. Kitchen island. Yeah.

540
01:42:16,149 --> 01:42:28,579
That looks nice. All right. I'm gonna leave everything open. So whoever is trying to rob

541
01:42:28,579 --> 01:42:34,390
this place knows, sees that there's literally nothing in this whole house. Right? If you come

542
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:54,279
in here, oh, I'm gonna steal. Let's get in there. No, nothing. Brute. It's fake. Okay. Cool. Now we

543
01:42:54,279 --> 01:43:08,420
need, uh, oh yeah. You need to have appliances. Distillation. All right. I'll give you something

544
01:43:08,420 --> 01:43:15,739
else. I want a different soundtrack. This is cool. I like Splatoon 2, but it lost me a little bit

545
01:43:15,739 --> 01:43:28,550
when I didn't get the song that I wanted. I didn't get that song. Not Yoshi's Islands,

546
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:41,899
Outer Wilds. Now that's a good one. I can get behind that one. Outer Wilds OST.

547
01:43:44,859 --> 01:43:49,399
Hey, remember when I gave Outer Wilds an 8.9 and you guys wanted to dip me in acid?

548
01:43:49,399 --> 01:44:12,170
I remember that. Oh yeah. This music is so good. I'm sorry, but an 8.9 is an incredible score.

549
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:28,949
8.9. That's a, that's fantastic. That's a very, very good score. Anything below a 9.5 is

550
01:44:28,949 --> 01:44:42,939
unacceptable. No, I think anything below an 8.5 would be unacceptable. Should I put this, this

551
01:44:43,739 --> 01:44:48,460
toilet paper? Should I really just be like a prank? There'd be a shitload of toilet paper

552
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:58,279
just in every cabinet or in one of the cabinets. Okay. In one cabinet over here, it's going to be

553
01:44:58,279 --> 01:45:04,520
full of toilet paper. He hated the game. No, it was a fucking great game. You know what? Fine. I'll

554
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:09,909
give it a nine. You want, you don't want to change. It's a 9.0. I was going to give it a 9.0.

555
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:29,369
Fine. It's a 9.0. No, it's not. It's an 8.9. Music's too low. The soundtrack sounds like an 8.9.

556
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:37,560
What does that mean? All right. Here we go. I want to do, I need kitchen shit.

557
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:46,729
Here we go. This wooden cabinet with an oven. It's not a real oven. I'm sure it's the same

558
01:45:46,729 --> 01:46:14,439
wood. Can I open the oven too? Like we don't have any food either, dude. I can't put this in the oven.

559
01:46:15,079 --> 01:46:43,590
Because now it's really loud. There. Toilet paper in the oven. I can't. I cannot put toilet paper in

560
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:48,630
the oven, unfortunately. I don't like this color either. It's too, it's way too bright.

561
01:46:49,189 --> 01:46:58,180
Give me the lighter one. Copper coin. I think that makes, yeah, that looks, that'll look nice.

562
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:17,510
That's my app. Better. Way better. So did somebody ask why does this house look so cheap?

563
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:33,560
Um, stick around for like another hour or two and you, wrong paint. Skin. Flasher walls. No, sorry.

564
01:47:33,560 --> 01:48:08,500
It's copper coin. How does that look bad? Sorry. Just getting a little sip. Meat walls. Damn. It's

565
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:19,239
really been almost two hours. How does this keep happening to me? All right. That is not this room

566
01:48:19,239 --> 01:48:31,050
anymore. Get out. There we are. This is alert, alert, alert, alert. This shouldn't be here.

567
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:42,170
This is messed up. Okay. What's the ground going to be? We need some kind of tile in them.

568
01:48:42,489 --> 01:48:52,199
Nobody has a carpeted kitchen. Floor. It's either tile or wood or floor. Something like this.

569
01:48:52,840 --> 01:49:00,600
Something easy. A little gray. No, no gray. Although I like that. I like the way this looks.

570
01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:15,979
Arcade carpet everywhere. Whatever it is, it's got to be cheap. I mean, is this the dead giveaway

571
01:49:15,979 --> 01:49:38,180
that this is not a real kitchen? That there's arcade carpet? Oh, that's so ugly. It's too,

572
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:44,739
it's so ugly. I can't even have it here as the funny thing. I go, haha, it's the arcade rug. No,

573
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:54,039
it's so bad. I don't do. Am I, am I like a dick? Okay. I don't want to be like a dick,

574
01:49:55,159 --> 01:50:03,369
but if you go and you're going to get carpet installed somewhere, what makes you point at

575
01:50:03,369 --> 01:50:17,020
this one and go, that's the one. Love it. How, how do you, what, how did this is, it's just,

576
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:27,829
it just hurts. You know, okay. If they took out, if they took out the yellow, okay, that maybe,

577
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:35,449
but it's like, it's too, it's like I'm looking at a magic eye painting. Like I'm going to go like

578
01:50:35,449 --> 01:50:40,170
this. I'm going to like cross my eyes and like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is going to be

579
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:53,859
there. You know, a lot of people can't do those and I couldn't do it for a really long time.

580
01:50:54,659 --> 01:51:00,819
If you cannot do a magic eye, I'm going to give you the secret. If when you look at a magic eye,

581
01:51:00,819 --> 01:51:03,060
you sit and you go, I can't make it work. I can't make it work.

582
01:51:04,329 --> 01:51:10,090
I just, just cross my eyes while I look at it. And when I cross my eyes and look at it, eventually

583
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:20,739
the picture just goes, Oh, here it is. Okay. What's it going to be over here? This is the garage.

584
01:51:20,739 --> 01:51:30,329
The garage is going to be a garage. It's not a secret. That's how it works. Wait, are you

585
01:51:30,329 --> 01:51:39,880
supposed to cross your eyes? That's the point. Yeah. But I thought it was usually, but I'm not

586
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:45,289
all people can just cross their eyes straight together. You know, it's actually hard for people

587
01:51:45,289 --> 01:51:51,460
to cross their eyes. Like they can't do it. So yeah, it's not a secret. I thought it was a secret

588
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:57,350
for the longest time when I was younger. Okay. I thought it was a secret when I was like 10.

589
01:51:58,069 --> 01:52:05,979
And this topic has never been brought up before until today. I don't think I've heard. I haven't

590
01:52:05,979 --> 01:52:10,840
thought about magic guys. There's 10 and like maybe like the two or three other times I've

591
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:18,170
referenced it before maybe, but I never talked about my secret. So my secret, that was knowledge.

592
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:34,090
That was 10 year old knowledge. I have not thought about that secret in 25 years. I'm still

593
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:56,489
crouching. Begging you start making sense when you talk. Sure. Time that person out for 10 minutes.

594
01:52:57,739 --> 01:53:09,109
Is that clear? Did that make sense? Steal his spoons.

595
01:53:10,949 --> 01:53:18,739
Tyrant, tyrant, evil, evil. I don't actually mean any of this shit. Don't you? There might be a lot

596
01:53:18,739 --> 01:53:24,460
of new viewers here. I'm 95% of the things that say are not even true. We only have a 5%

597
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:32,649
truth policy on this channel. Perfect. Oh yeah. Wait, was this an actual toxic waste barrel?

598
01:53:32,649 --> 01:53:56,100
How did I just get to that? Wait, it's an app. It's supposed to be yellow, right?

599
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:21,880
And then I don't go down there. That's where the radioactive stuff is. Make them red explosive

600
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:33,350
barrels. I can't. I want to make them yellow. I can't. Can I? Wait, I can make red explosive

601
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:42,739
barrels. Yeah. All right. So don't fuck around down here. Yeah. You turn this corner and this

602
01:54:42,739 --> 01:54:48,439
is anybody. It doesn't matter who you are. If you've ever played a single video game in your

603
01:54:48,439 --> 01:54:55,800
entire life, if you are in someone's house and you walk down these stairs and you see that,

604
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:00,439
this is a video game set up with poison barrels and an explosive barrel. I'm not going down here.

605
01:55:02,069 --> 01:55:07,399
I'm going to come back up the stairs and I'm going to say, you go first. Not going to be me

606
01:55:07,399 --> 01:55:18,630
first. Like, okay. There is like four guys over here and they're about to run at me with machine

607
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:30,020
guns and I'm supposed to shoot that barrel. Nope. I ain't going down. This is your house, man.

608
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:45,909
Perfect deterrent. All right. Good. Just build an FPS house. No, don't. This idea can't change.

609
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:58,539
I don't want to find like explosive barrels. Make it FPS house. No, it's perfect. It's so funny.

610
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:07,220
That was such a good idea. No, I can't make like a, I can't make the in the house. You're the shooter

611
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:13,060
FPS. You're in. I can't like, oh, you're going to go in here. It's like pub G explosive barrels of

612
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:22,970
weapons. God damn it. I gotta finish this. I'm finishing this one. I have to finish this. I have

613
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:30,810
to, I start, I can't just keep doing new houses. I can't. We started with mirror house, then it

614
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:36,970
turned into cars. People are in cars, living in the cars in the house. And then that turns into

615
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:47,289
a fake house. No, we're not turning this to FPS level. That's going to have to be the next one.

616
01:56:47,289 --> 01:56:53,720
ADHD TV. No, I can't. We can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Not right now. I have to finish my,

617
01:56:53,720 --> 01:57:18,119
my thing. FPS level up top. I have to make my dream house. It's so perfect though. It's so

618
01:57:18,119 --> 01:57:28,729
perfect. The perfect thing. All right. I'm going to finish this idea. And after the idea is over,

619
01:57:28,729 --> 01:57:39,340
it can be changed. Let me do my kitchen floor. Let me do my kitchen floor. Let me, here we are.

620
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:48,090
If you just, you need to, when you do social distancing, don't stand near each other. Don't

621
01:57:48,090 --> 01:58:04,779
be stupid and wear your fucking mask. There's no reason not to wear one. Hey, I think I can do a

622
01:58:04,779 --> 01:58:14,380
pretty good Fauci. You do know that like when I, when I unlock a new voice, you're going to hear

623
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:18,939
it at least four or five times in a month. I'm sorry. That's the way it is here. If you don't,

624
01:58:18,939 --> 01:58:26,649
if you can't handle that, I'm not sure what to tell you. I only get to unlock a new voice like

625
01:58:26,649 --> 01:58:38,439
every two or three years. You got to let me have it for a little while. Oh no. I gotta hurry up.

626
01:58:41,340 --> 01:59:21,609
Oh no. No, where is it? Does the screen go to black or does the screen go to white in that game?

627
01:59:21,609 --> 01:59:39,939
I couldn't figure it out. Stream just reverts to the beginning. All right. No, no more distractions.

628
01:59:39,939 --> 01:59:46,729
Stop. Don't distract me anymore. I'm done. Here we go. Floor tiles. I'm like the most easily

629
01:59:46,729 --> 02:00:05,159
distractable person. How about this one? Floor panels. There, there we are. Okay. That looks so

630
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:19,579
cozy. You built one room in three hours. It says, excuse me. First of all, you added 33% more time.

631
02:00:19,579 --> 02:00:26,899
You added a third more time. It's only been two hours. And no, I did one room and then a room

632
02:00:26,899 --> 02:00:35,079
before that when we changed the new houses. Okay. Good. There's my floor. Done. Next. What's up next?

633
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:42,489
Next thing we got, there's the kitchen. We got the stove, the sink. Uh, a microwave. It's okay.

634
02:00:42,489 --> 02:00:48,380
Did it just go over here? No, that's, you could unplug that and walk out with it. Things that can't

635
02:00:48,380 --> 02:01:03,640
be walked. Fine. That's good. All right. This has to be a hallway. And then you turn the corner,

636
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:07,880
you peek and there it is. FPS house. I can't get over it. That's so stupid.

637
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:17,369
There we are. Here's the kitchen. You open up. There you are.

638
02:01:19,539 --> 02:01:26,500
There's the bathroom, but it's not a bathroom. In fact, take this whole thing out. What's this

639
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:31,380
here for? For nothing. Did I put, what good expensive looking shit in the windows?

640
02:01:34,649 --> 02:01:38,729
In the, on the windows right here in the front of the house, just put really expensive looking

641
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:54,840
clocks. What's with, why are you baiting burglars to come in? Um, because I'm so,

642
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:58,039
I guess I'm so confident that they're never going to find the real house.

643
02:01:59,079 --> 02:02:08,329
I don't know. Like it's almost like I have like a camera set up up here, like in every room

644
02:02:09,699 --> 02:02:15,420
and I kind of just watch and try to find the real room. But then if they find it,

645
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:31,369
I'm in a lot of trouble. It's a Frank video house.

646
02:02:31,369 --> 02:02:44,119
Okay. This house is becoming a lot of different things.

647
02:02:47,859 --> 02:02:52,420
Yeah. The first is going to come in here and they're going to get chased around this

648
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:59,739
house by a guy in a gorilla suit. No more monkey in around here.

649
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:10,010
We'll see when we come back next on prank masters. They're always so huddled down in

650
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:15,609
front of the little screen they have. Oh, they're coming in. Like why do you have one screen?

651
02:03:16,569 --> 02:03:18,649
How come you don't have that way bigger? Why is it like,

652
02:03:18,649 --> 02:03:21,609
why are you like eight people hovering over and looking at somebody else's monitor?

653
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:35,420
Why would we put it up on the fucking wall, dude? It's always this wicked cramped ass room.

654
02:03:35,979 --> 02:03:41,640
Oh, they're in a room closet. Why wouldn't you have a huge setup for that?

655
02:03:42,279 --> 02:03:50,859
Well, they're always in like a hotel room. I know that some of that is because they're in

656
02:03:50,859 --> 02:03:57,260
the hotel room next door, but doesn't make any sense to me because if this 10 people

657
02:03:57,260 --> 02:04:02,119
all like laughing their ass off and talking in the hotel room next door,

658
02:04:02,119 --> 02:04:07,609
wouldn't you hear that if you were in the adjacent room?

659
02:04:07,609 --> 02:04:11,539
Like, can you imagine like you hear like a ding dong at your door and you hear like,

660
02:04:19,579 --> 02:04:20,140
who is it?

661
02:04:25,930 --> 02:04:29,239
I'm the pizza delivery gorilla.

662
02:04:29,239 --> 02:04:37,619
Uh, I just heard that over there. All right. I get, come on in.

663
02:04:37,619 --> 02:04:41,539
You got, Hey, uh, got, you're in a cool gorilla. So does somebody, you know, is there,

664
02:04:41,539 --> 02:04:45,210
are you, thanks for the pizza, dude. I didn't order a pizza.

665
02:04:51,130 --> 02:04:54,810
Let's throw the pizza. Don't throw the fucking pizza at me, dude. Don't, it's like,

666
02:04:54,810 --> 02:05:08,300
boom, slam the door. How does that always work? Why did I take this down? Oh, wait,

667
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:19,239
this makes actually, this kind of makes sense. And it makes sense for one reason

668
02:05:19,239 --> 02:05:25,189
is that I want the entrance here. No, yeah, I do. This is in the garage.

669
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:28,539
That's a perfect entrance. I want it to be tiny though.

670
02:05:29,979 --> 02:05:39,060
And I actually, no, I can't build on that. Shit. Remember, this would be a 10 out of 10 game.

671
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:43,619
If you could get rid of staircases and rebuild them somewhere, we're talking 10.

672
02:05:51,909 --> 02:05:54,550
No, I can't, I can't do what I wanted to do. So it's okay.

673
02:05:55,350 --> 02:06:06,819
Put it back. All right. We need to do a Sandy coin.

674
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:18,949
Prank shows are ridiculous though. I never like thought about being on a prank. Okay.

675
02:06:18,949 --> 02:06:22,229
Hi. Here's the thing. How many times do you think you may have been on a prank show that was never

676
02:06:22,229 --> 02:06:33,609
aired? I think about that. Like the joke didn't work on you. And they kind of just like leave.

677
02:06:33,609 --> 02:06:42,489
Like how many times have I may have seen somebody in a gorilla suit,

678
02:06:43,130 --> 02:06:46,729
like running around like screaming and she screams in my face or something. And I'm like,

679
02:06:46,729 --> 02:06:50,810
Hey, what the fuck? It's not like, Oh, I didn't get them. Just delete that part.

680
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:29,420
The shows are fake idiot. All right. We're not talking about like who won on the bachelor.

681
02:07:29,420 --> 02:07:37,189
We're talking about like a prank video. No, I don't think that they're real. I'm just saying

682
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:52,359
I have, I ever been on one. They're fake. You're on one right now.

683
02:08:00,789 --> 02:08:07,399
Stealable, stealable, stealable, stealable, stealable, extravagant. No, that's not going up here.

684
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:20,489
No lights either. Who cares? They'll have to bring a flashlight. Okay. That looks good.

685
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:31,189
Somebody said no fridge. Japan refrigerator. No, that's it. That sounds expensive.

686
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:49,750
No, why is this a wooden fridge? Okay. Now it's a skin house. I agree with you. Now

687
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:58,140
it's a horror movie, human skin furniture in appliance house. This would be scary.

688
02:09:00,439 --> 02:09:09,770
This would be terrifying without any context on this room. I'm leaving as soon as I get in here.

689
02:09:09,770 --> 02:09:20,649
The fruit there. Don't touch that fruit. Don't touch that. This is either fake and real. This

690
02:09:20,649 --> 02:09:31,239
is either fake with a trap on it. Real and poisoned. Don't touch this. Cool. All right.

691
02:09:31,239 --> 02:09:45,859
Let's go. Let's continue. Wooden. The Pinocchio house. Okay. Let's go. I need doors and windows.

692
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:59,210
Roman blinds. Wait, hold on. Can I just put a gigantic curtain here? Please. Please. No,

693
02:10:00,090 --> 02:10:17,689
I can't just put a big curtain. I guess I could just do a big door frame, right?

694
02:10:26,619 --> 02:10:44,710
And then hang the curtain on the door frame. I do that. Can I put something in this doorway?

695
02:10:45,350 --> 02:11:19,479
Just block it with barrels. No barrels. An outside hallway. No. Okay. All right. All right. All

696
02:11:19,479 --> 02:11:25,939
right. I guess what's the point of this? What's the point of the door frame? It doesn't matter.

697
02:11:25,939 --> 02:11:42,199
The doors are going to be open anyways. Slime raid. Yeah. Yeah. He's a good streamer.

698
02:11:44,579 --> 02:12:01,079
You don't know his name. You don't know his name. I haven't told you yet. Where's the raid from?

699
02:12:01,079 --> 02:12:21,029
What's the channel's name? Okay. I want carpet or wood. Wood on the ground. No carpet. Carpet.

700
02:12:21,029 --> 02:12:31,699
Carpet. Carpet. Carpet. How about somebody mentioned kitty litter before? There it is.

701
02:12:31,699 --> 02:13:03,659
Holding the kitty litter. This is an arcade carpet. Not quite. It's kind of. Let's do. Do

702
02:13:03,659 --> 02:13:27,460
I need any more wall down this way? Yeah. With a door or just like an opening. That's the garage.

703
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:53,689
Right. Okay. Hold on. Get rid of this. Absolutely rancid house. School library.

704
02:13:59,479 --> 02:14:06,039
We talked about wood earlier. This kind of carpet, if you lay down on it, would be like laying down

705
02:14:06,039 --> 02:14:22,739
on wood. There's nothing there. This is the same thickness as a sticker pack. It's just there so

706
02:14:22,739 --> 02:14:34,149
the cold concrete doesn't come through. What's going on up here? Cut that out. It pisses me off.

707
02:14:34,149 --> 02:14:41,000
All right, guys. I fucking just get mad sometimes. This is annoying.

708
02:14:41,640 --> 02:15:11,399
Dream house is coming along really well, I think. Good. Look. Look. Look. Psycho is going off the

709
02:15:11,399 --> 02:15:36,250
deep end. Psycho. What? I'm what? You're a psycho. Flesh kitchen, two left doors, explosive nuclear.

710
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:43,079
What? Flesh kitchen, two left doors, explosive nuclear barrels in the basement. Looks like a

711
02:15:43,079 --> 02:15:47,319
good house. Well, you don't know about those barrels yet until you decide to come fucking rob

712
02:15:47,319 --> 02:16:13,140
me. So this is that concept. So what is this incoming concept? No, no, no. I'm not talking

713
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:27,979
about the theme. All right. Let's do this quick. I'll leave that for now. This is the living area.

714
02:16:27,979 --> 02:16:39,209
Remember I said TV goes right here. I've removed the exact spot where the TV was supposed to go.

715
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:48,340
It's okay. The TV can be right here. Yeah, that's fine. Can I please hang one of those

716
02:16:48,899 --> 02:16:57,319
CRT TVs? Can I hang this? Please tell me I can hang this. I know how to do this. I'm going to

717
02:16:57,319 --> 02:17:27,209
put a shelf and then put it on the shelf. OK, good. Remember, this is supposed to be a fake IKEA house

718
02:17:27,209 --> 02:17:41,260
and these are made of plastic. It's not going to fall. It's got lots of back weight. Another DVD

719
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:56,500
player. I need hold on. I need some furniture. It's stapled. They always have this really,

720
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:08,280
really basic shitty little sofa too. I'm convinced that those like IKEA showroom sofas,

721
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:11,159
they're not actually purchasable. I know they have a tag on it, but I feel like they don't

722
02:18:11,159 --> 02:18:24,090
actually for sale. They are. I know, but I don't know. I feel like that it wouldn't even

723
02:18:24,090 --> 02:18:49,000
be hates IKEA. I actually like IKEA. I like eating at IKEA. IKEA foods. All right. Oh,

724
02:18:49,000 --> 02:19:16,809
that's awesome. You got to get that. The meatballs, man. The meatballs are awesome.

725
02:19:16,809 --> 02:19:19,610
Meatballs, gravy and fries. They actually do. The salmon's there's pretty good.

726
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:39,420
They still do a salmon. He hates bits. Oh shit. Did I miss one? I'm doing like a toilet paper

727
02:19:39,420 --> 02:20:00,440
like seance. OK, big bits. Let's see. Huge actually. Fucking hundred dollars. That's 10,000

728
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:13,219
bits. That's an insane amount of money, especially considering that people know now that I don't read

729
02:20:13,219 --> 02:20:18,389
messages anymore. I cannot believe there are people that are still willing to throw that kind

730
02:20:18,389 --> 02:20:31,100
of money at me. That's insane. I can't believe you would pay me that much money. This is my dream

731
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:36,940
house. No, no, no, no, no, no. But that was from slow. Sorry. Let me say that correctly. That was

732
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:47,750
from S10W update. Thank you for the hundred fucking bucks. I've been saving this. I'm grateful for

733
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:57,139
the years I spent watching content. I want you to keep that money. OK, if you have an opportunity

734
02:20:57,139 --> 02:21:02,020
to put a hundred dollars into my bank account or a hundred dollars into your savings account,

735
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:15,239
pick the savings account every time. Oh shit, there's a second room. This is both of the bathrooms

736
02:21:15,239 --> 02:21:28,360
down here. Right, right, right. I would much rather you come to me like four or five months from now

737
02:21:29,079 --> 02:21:35,399
and be like, oh yeah, I saved a bunch of money and be like, wait, wait, wait, where's my cut?

738
02:21:35,399 --> 02:21:47,270
You didn't give it to me. I want something else in here. But a hundred dollars is a lot of money.

739
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:55,159
And there's a lot of people that have given shit a shitload. That's why I appreciate the

740
02:21:55,159 --> 02:21:59,159
fact that you're willing to do that. But I hope that you're taking care of yourself first.

741
02:21:59,159 --> 02:22:15,110
But thank you S10W update. The hundred dollars is a lot of money. Hope I use it well. And they say

742
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:34,149
play Bioshock 2. I'll play Bioshock 1 first on the list. Oh my God, play that now. What is

743
02:22:34,149 --> 02:22:44,020
going on here? What's this? OK, I got to figure out what I want to do with these rooms. I did

744
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:48,420
my toilet paper like, got you like, oh yeah, somebody said this is your dream house. It is,

745
02:22:48,420 --> 02:23:01,299
but not yet. Need a wallpaper. I wish I could just do toilet paper on the walls.

746
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:46,309
I want to see what it looks like. Yeah, it is. No, no, it can't be that egregious. You know what

747
02:23:46,309 --> 02:23:53,100
I mean? It's got to be, I have to at least put a little tongue in cheek here. We're going to go

748
02:23:53,100 --> 02:24:22,069
with something just decent. It's kind of a living room wallpaper. This one here. Scary music. Turn

749
02:24:22,069 --> 02:24:36,069
it off. I can't get over the prank house. This really isn't. This is not even a prank house. This

750
02:24:36,069 --> 02:24:44,659
is a really shitty prank house. I'll come in here. Oh, this went on. What? What? What the heck? That's

751
02:24:44,659 --> 02:24:57,739
weird. It's kind of an odd thing. Toilet paper. Ha ha ha. In the place of stuff. I'm on TV. I'm on TV.

752
02:24:57,739 --> 02:25:40,549
Where is it? This is definitely, yeah, this is an I'm on TV house. It's so obvious. I got to change

753
02:25:40,549 --> 02:25:47,079
this music. This is putting me to sleep. I have mellowed the fuck out so hard since that music's

754
02:25:47,079 --> 02:26:04,860
been on. It's just, it's, it's, it's, it's just making me chilled out. I'm going to change the music.

755
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:41,139
Mario Kart. Nice. That'll do it. Mario Kart. Um, I typed DLC. OST. That's much better. That's that

756
02:26:41,219 --> 02:26:49,180
room. That's that. We're going to make a, it's going to stay open. That's the concept I'm going

757
02:26:49,180 --> 02:27:05,049
for. Very good. Louder. I've increased it by 100%. Let's go down here. Looks pretty good. Garage

758
02:27:05,049 --> 02:27:29,750
door. Got to fix that little gap. I wish I could paint the ceiling. Do I need my couch? Louder. No,

759
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:43,590
I don't want to be louder. It's loud enough. Louder. 100% louder. Fine. I'm looking for a couch.

760
02:27:43,590 --> 02:27:58,620
There it is. It's expensive, but that's the one I'm talking about. This is one of those weird sofas

761
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:16,950
that the back is too short and your feet don't touch the ground somehow because you're short.

762
02:28:16,950 --> 02:28:24,729
No, it's because the cushions too high. There we go. That's leather though. Too expensive.

763
02:28:25,450 --> 02:28:38,280
It's a nice coffin bed. Why would I want to lie in? I don't want to lie on this panini press.

764
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:53,299
This is going to squish me and grill me. I don't want this. This sucks so much that I feel like

765
02:28:53,299 --> 02:29:12,059
it should be in this house. No, no, I'm just made myself so hungry. It's like a fresh s'more. That's

766
02:29:12,059 --> 02:29:16,139
hasn't been squished yet and they're going to put the chocolate in it and squish it.

767
02:29:16,139 --> 02:29:19,860
God damn it. I can't look at that anymore. I can't look at that. It looks like a delicious

768
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:32,100
ice cream cake. I might have to get rid of that. It's too delicious looking. Get it out of my house.

769
02:29:34,459 --> 02:29:39,819
I'm going to go here. The barrels are down there. Let's go over here.

770
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:47,850
The wooden thing. I'm fucking wicked nervous now. What's going on?

771
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:54,260
Um, I think I'm going to put in the air conditioner downstairs. What's wrong?

772
02:29:56,440 --> 02:30:19,530
I think I heard the clock up. Did I put more fruit? Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

773
02:30:25,719 --> 02:30:37,299
Now something's really wrong. Whoa, weird house, man. What is this crazy looking thing?

774
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:42,569
Not a real clock. Not a real clock. Not a real clock. It's a child's clock. I'm going to die.

775
02:30:42,569 --> 02:30:53,899
I'm dead. I'm already dead. I've already died because I booked up here. I'm dead. Faster. No,

776
02:30:53,899 --> 02:30:59,530
slower. All right. I'm going to do whatever. What color is the actual this place going to be?

777
02:31:04,649 --> 02:31:33,860
White? Not red. Green? I mean, what's wrong with the clock? The clock is backwards? Why? No, it's

778
02:31:33,860 --> 02:31:55,219
not. Is it one? Well, one, two, it's backwards. It is backwards. That makes it even worse. I don't

779
02:31:55,219 --> 02:32:01,049
like this. Why do I have to keep playing the music that makes me wicked anxious? I know it's the OST,

780
02:32:01,049 --> 02:32:05,290
but you do have to have the full soundtrack with when there's 10 seconds left in the game.

781
02:32:06,010 --> 02:32:11,690
That's one of his songs. I don't want to hear the sped up, scary, you're going to lose song right

782
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:36,020
after it. Is that the table? Get this fucking off. But Mario Kart N64 soundtrack. I'm liking

783
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:48,440
that one. That's better. It's even wrong in the picture too. All right. What was I doing?

784
02:32:54,649 --> 02:33:08,219
Oh, it's good. It looks good. I was going to do. Okay. We have furniture. Lock. Did this stay open?

785
02:33:11,350 --> 02:33:25,479
All right. Color for out here. Let's go with a no bright pink, right? Lavender is way too obvious.

786
02:33:26,200 --> 02:33:45,260
Heavy green. No, too dark. Way too dark. Select your player.

787
02:33:51,159 --> 02:34:03,139
Select your level. What's happening? Oh, I've just kind of channeled that. Sorry about that.

788
02:34:05,219 --> 02:34:17,450
We're going with blood. No, not blood. Not dark lavender. I tried blood red. Let's see what it

789
02:34:17,450 --> 02:34:44,170
looks like. It's got to be lights in here. Red. You know, you did that voice by sucking in air,

790
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:50,729
but I don't know if I can do that right now with my chest. I could, I would really be able to do

791
02:34:50,729 --> 02:35:03,139
like that. I would be able to do it, but I can't do that right now. Voice lost. Gained. Dr. Fauci

792
02:35:03,139 --> 02:35:17,180
lost red rum. Damn it. I think that's, I think that's a good, that's a really good trade.

793
02:35:22,379 --> 02:35:38,540
That's fair. I'll take that a thousand times. All right. Can somebody select a level and pick

794
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:53,959
what mode we're going to play? This is also panic inducing. Like, why have you not picked? So why

795
02:35:53,959 --> 02:36:00,010
have you taken it? It's taking you this long. Pick a level and pick the, please pick a character.

796
02:36:03,350 --> 02:36:08,069
I've never heard this song for this long and it's freaking me out. I've only heard this song for

797
02:36:08,069 --> 02:36:16,739
10 straight seconds. Never five minutes. This is an audio sensation I've never had. And it's,

798
02:36:16,739 --> 02:36:36,950
I, I don't want it anymore. Skip it. I can't. There we are. Oh, my Mia.

799
02:36:40,379 --> 02:36:59,290
Whoa, you spooked toad. That's what you heard every single time. And then the occasional, uh,

800
02:37:03,209 --> 02:37:11,479
there's always Luigi too. Oh, Luigi would always get hit by something in the very beginning.

801
02:37:11,479 --> 02:37:15,799
Nobody even had to run over one of those cubes. Luigi just got hurt every time.

802
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:36,889
You would hear his, I got hit sound from across the game. Do the toad, do toad falling off the

803
02:37:36,889 --> 02:37:40,489
map. I, that's what I think it is. It's a Tasmanian devil where I have to go all out for it.

804
02:37:41,209 --> 02:38:01,299
This is only one way you do that. This is going to be hard to do. If I nailed this.

805
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:18,600
Nope. I tried twice. Hard. Let's try it one more time. Oh, I won't do it again. I can't,

806
02:38:19,319 --> 02:38:48,520
I can't do it. I cannot do it. Good effort. Yeah. Make a painting noise. Should this be,

807
02:38:48,520 --> 02:39:03,909
wait, this room's supposed to be blood red. I can probably do it without yelling.

808
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:20,309
You can't unless you can't. It's not possible. You have to, when you say, when you say,

809
02:39:21,989 --> 02:39:25,750
out loud, you have to be that person's actual voice. Nobody can do that.

810
02:39:30,010 --> 02:39:44,920
No, that was not the worst noise. 2028 over yet. All right. It's not, it wasn't. No, no, no,

811
02:39:44,920 --> 02:40:03,239
it wasn't. I can't hold on. I have so much trouble. I need to paint these walls blue.

812
02:40:03,879 --> 02:40:11,180
That's why I don't listen to music. You guys know the secret, the real reason why I don't

813
02:40:11,180 --> 02:40:18,940
listen to music because my ADHD brain and not listen to it, I have to focus on it. And when

814
02:40:18,940 --> 02:40:27,829
I focus on it, I lose, I lose complete everything. All I can see right now in my mind, I can't see

815
02:40:27,829 --> 02:40:35,079
anything or hear anything else besides the banjo. That's, that's the, I'm playing it visually on the

816
02:40:35,079 --> 02:41:19,899
screen. Okay. We fixed it. Mr. Spot. Did I? Somebody said I was trying, didn't finish the

817
02:41:19,899 --> 02:41:44,200
blue room. What? I don't like that. What should be over here? It's good. This looks good.

818
02:41:44,840 --> 02:42:09,780
Put a bunch of trash in here. Turn this shit off. I was reading what somebody said. Okay. Let's go

819
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:17,639
to paint. Now this all can stay the same. I just need some junk in here. Is it just like a junk

820
02:42:17,639 --> 02:42:57,219
category? I see. Definitely need one of these. Make it less loud. We go. Okay. Cool. I like it.

821
02:42:57,780 --> 02:43:06,520
Just needs to, should it just go all the way around? People paint their garages white. Yeah,

822
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:40,659
just white. So funky. And it's a low volume funky. This is the Aqua teen house.

823
02:43:41,540 --> 02:43:44,340
I'm trying to get away from the Aqua teen house. It's not the Aqua teen house.

824
02:43:51,540 --> 02:44:22,020
It is, but maybe a little. You made the Aqua teen house through muscle reflexes. That's so funny to

825
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:28,680
me because that means I've done this potentially thousands of times. Am I such a huge Aqua teen

826
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:38,139
fan? I gotta, I gotta get it right one day. I did not make the Aqua teen house through muscle

827
02:44:38,139 --> 02:45:09,860
memory. I haven't seen an episode of that show in probably five years. I have paint. Yeah. Good.

828
02:45:09,860 --> 02:45:20,569
Let's put some of the just very, very, very normal stuff to have in your. Yeah. Let's put some,

829
02:45:21,129 --> 02:45:32,760
some junk. Junk works. Get junk. Other. What have we got in the other category?

830
02:45:34,379 --> 02:45:44,620
Should we put a safe with toilet paper in it? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

831
02:45:46,860 --> 02:45:53,059
No, absolutely not. I mean, this, this has to be, this has to have money in it.

832
02:45:55,100 --> 02:46:00,420
Right. For this to work, like, oh, there's nothing in here, but there's like a dollar,

833
02:46:00,420 --> 02:46:30,280
just $2 in here. Spoon. I can't put the spoon in there. Oh shit. This is an FPS house.

834
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:38,739
Like, okay, I come in here. Oh, look, there's like an item over here in the item spot.

835
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:48,409
Oh, it's like 10 ammo. Weird fucked up kitchen. Like guy, like up two monsters. Boom, boom. Like,

836
02:46:49,530 --> 02:46:53,770
turn this way. Like somebody jumps through here. Weird clock and weird room.

837
02:46:57,270 --> 02:47:10,010
And then into the garage down the stairs. I did, I did it already. This is what makes it that like

838
02:47:13,340 --> 02:47:30,549
whatever the pub G house. There you go. Good. It's a pub G house. You missed a spot.

839
02:47:35,399 --> 02:47:48,229
Oops. Add purple loot. I mean, I could probably put like images on the ground, like paintings on

840
02:47:48,229 --> 02:47:55,700
the ground of just like Fortnite weapons, but then that becomes a full on FPS house. And we're not

841
02:47:55,700 --> 02:48:05,159
there. We're not doing that. Like have this open and have to be like three or four purple items on

842
02:48:05,159 --> 02:48:33,850
the ground. Good. All right. No more paint backyard gas back here. What happened over here? Oh, right.

843
02:48:33,850 --> 02:48:51,370
I was going to project for a different day. I think this is good. I think this works. Welcome.

844
02:48:55,299 --> 02:48:58,950
This paint's got to change though. All right. What can you see when you look in here?

845
02:48:59,750 --> 02:49:24,809
Something to steal. It's flawed. It's flawed. It can't be in here. Let's make that better.

846
02:49:25,450 --> 02:49:45,979
They spoke fluorescent. How do you spell for more? S fluorescent. You is a you first. It's

847
02:49:45,979 --> 02:49:57,260
flora fluorescent. Okay. I was close. Oh man. Oh no. I thought this was a play bar.

848
02:49:58,219 --> 02:50:02,059
Like the video was supposed to be up here. And there's like, this is the play bar.

849
02:50:02,059 --> 02:50:21,270
I was like, what did I click on? You get one light. You redditor. I'm not, that's why I'm not

850
02:50:21,270 --> 02:50:29,340
making a joke. I'm not, that's not a joke. I promise you that you can believe one thing today.

851
02:50:29,340 --> 02:50:41,370
It's not me making a joke. It's like, it's trying to load an ad. It's an image of a TV on the wall.

852
02:50:42,010 --> 02:50:57,190
It's not a bad idea. I don't use fluorescence. There's not even a light switch. I think we're

853
02:50:57,270 --> 02:51:00,950
done with the upstairs. This is one space here, which I guess we could put like

854
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:07,350
expensive stuff in the walls. How about this? Very like a, it was like a cabinet.

855
02:51:07,909 --> 02:51:41,139
It was way too nice. This really is making an FPS in something that's not a video game engine.

856
02:51:45,290 --> 02:51:59,049
You know what I mean? Like this wasn't made in unreal. This was made in a video game that uses

857
02:51:59,129 --> 02:52:20,950
unreal. Put guns. That is unreal. No, no, I think you're missing what I'm saying. It's not unreal.

858
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:25,350
You don't open like unreal engine and go in the engine and make a game. You make the game

859
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:35,719
in the game that already exists, but that game is using assets from unreal engine. Like, like,

860
02:52:35,719 --> 02:52:55,059
like Gary's mod or something. You don't like going in code in the engine. He's rambling. What? What

861
02:52:55,059 --> 02:53:02,069
are you talking about? Like I'm talking about like a game maker studio for or something not

862
02:53:02,069 --> 02:53:09,989
unreal. You don't like make this in unreal engine. Actually you do code. All code is in engine.

863
02:53:12,549 --> 02:53:16,069
He's not wrong. I feel like I'm questioning my whole life right now.

864
02:53:29,139 --> 02:53:37,030
Stop bragging. I think it's time to start my house. What do you think? We'll do some,

865
02:53:37,030 --> 02:53:46,899
we'll tidy up upstairs. Why is it so dirty over here? Why is it so dirty down here?

866
02:53:46,899 --> 02:54:09,500
I had to change it. All right. This is going to be my real house. This is my real bathroom.

867
02:54:10,139 --> 02:54:23,000
This is my real house here. Get to work. You come in here. Ball. What's in the way?

868
02:54:33,299 --> 02:54:48,860
FPS boss fight. It's not a boss fight. Okay. We're fine. I'm the boss. Do I do what? Do I just stand

869
02:54:48,860 --> 02:54:55,719
down here? I really am making an FPS fucking level. No, this is supposed to be like trick.

870
02:54:56,040 --> 02:55:01,479
This is the prank house. This is trick the guy to come in here. The guy comes in here. You're

871
02:55:01,479 --> 02:55:07,079
tricking him with all kinds of weird tricks. He finally makes it around here. He gets down to you.

872
02:55:07,079 --> 02:55:11,719
This is a level. That's a level. You try to stop the main character from coming down to your like

873
02:55:11,719 --> 02:55:28,459
secret stash of stuff that you have behind you. And you're the guy with like the gun. What happened?

874
02:55:28,459 --> 02:55:39,899
Okay. I'm ready to damn it. My vision. Yo dude, Charles entertainment cheese is streaming.

875
02:55:48,649 --> 02:56:01,139
I hope so. That'd be like funny. Okay. Furniture. I need a huge bed. How many rooms should my

876
02:56:01,139 --> 02:56:23,030
house be? Is this this? This can be over here. This is going to turn the room before the room.

877
02:56:23,670 --> 02:56:33,770
How much space do I get? This is a, this is a room here. This is a room here.

878
02:56:34,329 --> 02:56:40,969
But this is a room here. Okay. Right here. I got to block this out and then I can look at it later

879
02:56:40,969 --> 02:56:50,200
and figure it out. Bathroom here. There's going to be a door there, which leads into this room,

880
02:56:50,920 --> 02:57:07,059
which then this is a hallway. Then this is a room. All right. Let's figure this out. Bathroom,

881
02:57:07,940 --> 02:57:25,270
the door here, right here. That looks good. You got to go. Have a good stream. Well, thanks for

882
02:57:25,270 --> 02:57:38,920
coming. Hope your day is filled pleasantries. All right. That's where doors can go. And then this is

883
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:43,909
a door is going to go. Where am I? Wait, what is that? What room is this?

884
02:57:45,579 --> 02:58:05,239
Okay. That's bathroom. Okay. Right here. This is making me irrationally angry that it's not

885
02:58:05,239 --> 02:58:13,879
right here. The door has to line up with this door, fill the basement with mirrors. I cannot

886
02:58:13,879 --> 02:58:26,920
do mirrors again. I will puke. That looks fine. You go through here. There's a hallway here. This

887
02:58:26,920 --> 02:59:08,379
leads to here. And then this is a room. Bathroom, room, hallway, room. Wait. Okay.

888
02:59:10,540 --> 02:59:20,010
So this is a hallway here. I'm going to have to put a med pack right there. This is my room.

889
02:59:20,010 --> 02:59:32,500
This is the bathroom. It's all leading to the bathroom. You're making an airsoft house now.

890
02:59:39,059 --> 02:59:56,780
I don't know if that means, but I think it's funny. Door, door, door, internal door. Get out of the

891
02:59:56,780 --> 03:00:40,870
way. Cool. All right. Kind of weird how it opens. This is rainbow road. Yep. What happened? What's

892
03:00:40,870 --> 03:01:25,780
down? How does it look wrong? Okay. We heard one that went through once. Turn it down. Look,

893
03:01:25,780 --> 03:02:06,100
this is the electric guitar part. Okay. Door. All right. Let's go. God, this is to go to the

894
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:16,090
bathroom. Honestly, I don't even need to have a door on the bathroom. I can make this a super

895
03:02:16,090 --> 03:02:46,760
bathroom. Somebody said this is a filler house. Filler house. I love that term. God,

896
03:02:48,170 --> 03:03:43,000
get out of here. This is the shower. Fuck. Did anyone know what this is called? What

897
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:49,139
is this noise called? I hear it everywhere. And I never, what do you search for? Like

898
03:03:49,780 --> 03:04:16,489
keyboard sound. There's no way. What is it called? I don't know how this is somehow worse than the

899
03:04:16,489 --> 03:04:20,659
mirror house to me. Yeah. This is worse than the mirror house. I don't like it down here.

900
03:04:21,219 --> 03:04:35,879
This is supposed to be my dream house. It's unsettling. It is. It's really unsettling. I

901
03:04:35,879 --> 03:04:47,659
don't like it. It's making me wicked uncomfortable. Or maybe it's the Baldi's basics thing in the

902
03:04:47,659 --> 03:05:00,809
background. Why are we going so fast? No, I don't, I have to get rid of this. I'm just actually going

903
03:05:00,809 --> 03:05:19,690
to hurt my head. We're going to keep this. That was, there was another three or four minutes on that.

904
03:05:31,209 --> 03:05:41,399
Now I made an FPS house, but this is a really, this is not even a good FPS level. I forgot to

905
03:05:41,399 --> 03:06:03,670
remove some of this stuff when I was making the game puzzle game. No, I'll make it. I'm no dream

906
03:06:03,670 --> 03:06:16,979
house. That's fine. Take this down. Did he make another joke house? So halfway, half joke house.

907
03:06:17,860 --> 03:06:38,340
Now this is real house. I want to actually make my stuff awesome down here. There's the door

908
03:06:38,979 --> 03:06:45,780
member. It's supposed to be a secret. So when you come in here, this room here is just storage.

909
03:06:47,190 --> 03:07:21,690
Like a closet. This is the house. Welcome. All right. Sort by, uh, price. Welcome. Okay. Let's do

910
03:07:21,690 --> 03:07:40,620
floor search, search by price. Ooh, I like this little explosive. I don't know. We're going to

911
03:07:40,620 --> 03:07:51,780
get into these brick walls. Walls are killing it for me. My perfect wall. I'm being serious.

912
03:07:53,139 --> 03:08:08,870
My absolute, my go-to, the wall I actually like is gray, gray, beige. No, no, no. I once like,

913
03:08:08,870 --> 03:08:23,780
what was that? Silver gray, silver Galatia. Look at that. It looks so nice. You're boring.

914
03:08:25,129 --> 03:08:37,590
That's fine. But I actually truly enjoy, uh, shades of gray. The best part about gray is there,

915
03:08:37,670 --> 03:08:49,659
there are so many shades. You get a blue, light blue. It's like, you can put gray,

916
03:08:49,659 --> 03:08:57,719
like brown, gray, beige. Yeah. There's about 50. I'd say there's probably 50. I'm a huge fan of

917
03:08:57,719 --> 03:09:15,659
all the 50. Big fan. I didn't, I didn't even complete it. I didn't even, you know,

918
03:09:15,659 --> 03:09:20,860
I didn't even want to complete it because it was so easy. I didn't want to complete it. You guys did.

919
03:09:20,860 --> 03:09:37,860
That's fine. I didn't, I'm not going to complete that one. All right. Looking good. I actually

920
03:09:37,860 --> 03:09:50,600
believe that though. I truly do believe that I like gray. I like all the shades of gray. I like

921
03:09:50,600 --> 03:10:12,889
blue gray. I like brown gray. I like them. There are two different grays. Prove it. Eat gray on

922
03:10:12,889 --> 03:10:28,100
stream. I don't think I would want to eat anything gray on stream because the gray is like mold.

923
03:10:30,649 --> 03:10:42,219
All right. I don't like the floors. Floors have to change. Floor panels and covering.

924
03:10:42,780 --> 03:10:46,649
All right. So the most expensive thing is this carpet. I don't like that carpet.

925
03:10:49,159 --> 03:11:02,600
What is it? How is wood more expensive? How is wood less expensive than carpet? Perfect. In a

926
03:11:02,600 --> 03:11:33,670
perfect world, this would be tile. It is. It will be tile. I'm sorry everybody. Just let me get a

927
03:11:33,670 --> 03:11:52,809
look at it first before everybody freaks out. This is not a perfect world. Come on here.

928
03:11:53,450 --> 03:12:07,190
Expensive. I would definitely, this is what I would want, but I can't set how many, how big I want it.

929
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:32,489
This is a normie house. So it's a normal house. It's a regular house. What kind of house do you

930
03:12:32,489 --> 03:12:42,469
want to live in? I mean, we made the joke about like having discovery zone in your backyard, but

931
03:12:42,469 --> 03:13:07,739
is that, is that so weird to want just to live in a normal house? This is for later. Can I not put

932
03:13:07,739 --> 03:13:30,790
this anywhere? Okay. What's the most expensive fireplace? Okay. Here we go. Galactic sauna heater.

933
03:13:30,790 --> 03:13:36,229
Electric fireplace. Yeah. Look at this. And it's already gray. I don't even have to do anything.

934
03:13:36,309 --> 03:13:45,500
I won't. No, I'd like the smoky gray. That looks so good. Dude. Oh my God. Give it to me today.

935
03:13:46,379 --> 03:13:51,420
Where can I pick this up? Where can I pick this up? I want that. Look at how, look at that.

936
03:13:54,260 --> 03:14:23,030
Oh, so angular and there's so much like the material. I love like that shiny stone. Don't

937
03:14:23,030 --> 03:14:50,329
you just want to live inside of that? Beautiful. Okay. I need some shelving furniture. We need a

938
03:14:51,049 --> 03:14:57,559
most expensive, awesome ass couch. This one, but I don't want to, I don't want to blue.

939
03:15:09,700 --> 03:15:37,000
It's actually pretty good. That looks good. It's bigger than it looks in the picture. One, two,

940
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:41,000
three, four, five, six, seven. When am I ever expecting seven people to come over?

941
03:15:42,549 --> 03:16:06,840
Wait, can this be saved? Yeah, I can. Hold on for those cold nights. You know what I mean?

942
03:16:07,479 --> 03:16:55,459
I need a place to sleep. Yeah, I know. I know this is an evil guy bed. This is an evil sorcerer bed,

943
03:16:56,100 --> 03:18:21,030
but it's the most expensive thing. I won. Nice. This is my dream house. That means I have a fixture

944
03:18:21,030 --> 03:18:28,219
built into the structure. That is a bathroom that I can go take a shit and play video games on. Like

945
03:18:28,219 --> 03:18:47,379
I used to do when I was like a kid, used to what, what question marks when I was, when I was younger

946
03:18:47,379 --> 03:18:53,620
up until probably, I was like 20. Whenever like laptops became small enough to use, I used to

947
03:18:53,620 --> 03:18:59,299
bring my entire computer into the bathroom and set the whole thing up and just be on the computer

948
03:18:59,299 --> 03:19:06,250
and play games and shit while I took a shit. And then I had to take all of it out. And after I was

949
03:19:06,250 --> 03:19:12,469
satisfied and done going and I was, it was over the daunting task of now I have to redo my whole

950
03:19:12,469 --> 03:19:27,659
computer setup for like maybe like an hour and 12 minutes worth of enjoyment. Not anymore because

951
03:19:27,659 --> 03:19:34,379
now this is my dream home. This is permanent here. This is a dedicated computer in here.

952
03:19:34,379 --> 03:19:43,579
I don't think there'll be two computers. Sorry that you don't know that. And there's a little

953
03:19:43,659 --> 03:20:02,969
heater right there. Monitor. Am I writing Minotaur? Monitor. He told us this story. Yeah,

954
03:20:02,969 --> 03:20:11,500
but I never made it in my dream house. Okay. Wait, I need this. I need a little stool.

955
03:20:31,459 --> 03:21:21,059
Now you've lost. Really? Like a little corner table. Come on, man. What's this even doing in

956
03:21:21,059 --> 03:21:49,610
here? That's not in my dream house. Okay. This is for like drinks and shit for the mouse and keyboard

957
03:21:50,170 --> 03:22:27,829
right here. Toilet. Toilet plumbing system. Toilet. Okay. How long is this?

958
03:22:30,090 --> 03:23:27,479
Skip next please. Yep. A little bit more to the left. Damn it. Damn it. I gotta move the,

959
03:23:27,479 --> 03:23:35,829
I gotta move the toilet. No, I don't. This can be different. Doesn't have to be the same.

960
03:23:35,829 --> 03:23:54,250
Just need a little thing. How about this? How big is this? The ultimate gamer throne. Get in there.

961
03:23:54,809 --> 03:24:13,850
For the wall? No, it doesn't need to be that big. Just need a little thing. A little tiny little

962
03:24:13,850 --> 03:24:33,260
thing. Got it. Perfect. Perfect reach too. You see? If you're sitting here, your arm is right there.

963
03:24:34,139 --> 03:24:58,059
Here's the next part of this. How do you get in here reliably? I know. You just drag it.

964
03:24:58,059 --> 03:25:02,729
It stores over here. And then when you're ready to go to the bathroom, you like,

965
03:25:03,690 --> 03:25:29,290
ah, just slide it over. And keyboard. Look at that. And the keyboard will just sit on my lap.

966
03:25:29,290 --> 03:26:00,940
Here's a couple of drinks. Maybe dinner. Food. Go. Okay, go. Okay, go. Yeah, look at this. And I

967
03:26:00,940 --> 03:26:05,260
could just sit down. There's the mouse. Keyboard right on the lap. I could even get like a little

968
03:26:05,260 --> 03:26:21,739
keyboard tray if I really wanted to. I need a shower, don't I? Oh, well, I need a shower.

969
03:26:22,379 --> 03:26:49,209
You can still get in and out. Just my sodas. Drinks. Soda. Um, water? Like, what would it

970
03:26:49,209 --> 03:27:10,920
even be under? Why the walls have changed? Well, I think the walls have to be white.

971
03:27:12,360 --> 03:27:40,360
Like, teeth white. Colgate white. Yeah, I already like it better. Painting is

972
03:27:41,770 --> 03:27:49,559
part of, is bad for back support? No, I don't like, this is public bathroom vibe. I don't like that.

973
03:27:52,200 --> 03:27:54,760
Green tile in bathroom always means public bathroom.

974
03:28:12,149 --> 03:28:17,020
You're just painting over the tiles. Yeah, it's a video game. It's okay.

975
03:28:17,899 --> 03:28:31,030
That'd be pretty messed up. I agree. Oh, no. Now it's just a not rendered room.

976
03:28:31,909 --> 03:29:00,780
No, this has to change too. Wall. Foot looks good. These? Try these. But I'll do what they did.

977
03:29:00,780 --> 03:29:54,629
Why does it look like they made it a colored pencil? This is a Yoshi's Island wall? Hold on,

978
03:29:54,629 --> 03:30:04,010
I gotta put these down. It's supposed to be two. One. Two. I'm gonna fix it. Don't worry.

979
03:30:04,809 --> 03:30:17,219
Here Mario. I baked you a delicious cake. If you, uh, uh, peach from Mario 64 is Mickey Mouse.

980
03:30:32,149 --> 03:30:48,540

983
03:31:20,120 --> 03:31:26,420

984
03:31:26,420 --> 03:31:54,360

985
03:31:54,360 --> 03:32:26,899

986
03:32:26,899 --> 03:32:47,940
I would have wished I hit my thumb because I just might've destroyed the house. Okay. So this is one,

03:50:10,000 --> 03:50:19,989
ton of padding not so much padding where it feels like you're walking around on a

diaper I've been in those places before and I don't like it it even makes the

mirrors you'd be the most annoying neighbor in history glare coming off of

1258
04:37:04,779 --> 04:37:18,500
your house would be blinding I don't think you'd be able to beat if the Sun

1259
04:37:18,500 --> 04:37:25,500
was shining brightly like it is right there and you lived in this house that

1260
04:37:25,500 --> 04:37:33,810
what would that do he's doing the mirror house thing again oh yeah shit I can't

1261
04:37:33,810 --> 04:37:39,169
do that again I know like an invisible house is funny but I don't want to sit

1262
04:37:39,169 --> 04:37:57,130
here for an hour and 20 minutes doing this it would catch on fire and let's

1263
04:37:57,130 --> 04:38:13,200
do one guy in chat save this stream sure all right now let's do outdoor paint to

1264
04:38:13,200 --> 04:38:19,740
make it really just gray and boring maybe not maybe that maybe this is the

1265
04:38:19,740 --> 04:38:30,150
fake part of the house we're gonna do this kit is white how much is white how

1266
04:38:30,150 --> 04:38:47,259
boring does this look plaid Mayo house did you guys know I just recently learned

1267
04:38:47,299 --> 04:38:51,979
this do you know that if something is called Mayo it doesn't actually have to

1268
04:38:51,979 --> 04:38:59,000
be mayonnaise to truly call your product mayonnaise and it's actually really

1269
04:38:59,000 --> 04:39:04,090
mayonnaise it has to have a specific set of ingredients if you call something

1270
04:39:04,090 --> 04:39:09,799
Mayo it could be pretty close but it's not actually mayonnaise if you see like

1271
04:39:09,799 --> 04:39:13,959
oh like you check out this one light Mayo that's not mayonnaise it's

1272
04:39:13,959 --> 04:39:19,750
legally not mayonnaise it needs to be a certain amount of egg yep there I'm gonna

1273
04:39:19,950 --> 04:39:27,020
certain amount of oil I did not know that I was marketing tricks forever I

1274
04:39:27,020 --> 04:39:56,650
thought that Mayo was just mayonnaise cool random fact XD man oh come on that

1275
04:39:56,650 --> 04:40:03,840
is like a kind of interesting fact come on man that's a kind that's pretty

1276
04:40:03,840 --> 04:40:07,240
interesting I didn't know that as of like a few days ago that's interesting

1277
04:40:07,240 --> 04:40:32,689
that's an interesting thing because I said it yeah if like Bill Nye was on

1278
04:40:32,689 --> 04:40:35,529
camera right now talking about how mayonnaise and mayo are not the same

1279
04:40:35,529 --> 04:40:39,259
thing and he had like a bunch of test tubes and those glasses on you'd be

1280
04:40:39,259 --> 04:40:58,299
like oh cool but I say it and I'm a weirdo you don't you don't have a

1281
04:40:58,299 --> 04:41:40,720
science music there is no music this is birds let's change that so sucks it

1282
04:41:40,720 --> 04:41:45,139
like really does something look like mayonnaise it looks like a big

1283
04:41:45,139 --> 04:41:52,220
marshmallow I don't really want to get on the

1284
04:41:52,220 --> 04:42:04,819
scaffolding so I think it's gonna stay yellow mayonnaise isn't white it's it is

1285
04:42:04,860 --> 04:42:09,259
but it's slightly it's a little it's like a it's a kind of a cream color

1286
04:42:09,259 --> 04:42:20,680
isn't it it's a little bit on the yellow side isn't it not pure white who

1287
04:42:20,680 --> 04:43:30,919
needs it yeah I need a scaffolding don't think I do I'll do the other side

1288
04:43:49,840 --> 04:43:54,919
you ever just stand outside and listen to birds and then actually sit there

1289
04:43:54,919 --> 04:43:59,680
and go I'll just sit in the background this is so loud and there's so many of

1290
04:43:59,680 --> 04:44:15,520
them it's not until you really sit there and listen for 10 seconds and go holy

1291
04:44:15,520 --> 04:44:36,540
shit what is it pac-man dying sounds it's a sorting algorithm Galaga it is

1292
04:44:36,540 --> 04:44:45,759
Galaga all right what fucking weird bird is this I need to find out what the what

1293
04:44:45,759 --> 04:44:57,400
the Galaga bird is hold on pause everything turn them off turn off of

1294
04:44:57,400 --> 04:45:08,040
where's the other one coming from okay what is that world's weirdest bird dusky

1295
04:45:08,040 --> 04:45:15,639
grouse no what is it crested or okay this is apparently what the crested

1296
04:45:15,639 --> 04:45:39,639
oro pendola sounds like that's crazy I can't believe that that's unbelievable

1297
04:45:39,639 --> 04:45:45,590
show a bird show bird rested on one I gotta get a good photo it's kind of

1298
04:45:45,590 --> 04:46:07,380
bald it's got a bald head look that's what it looks like

1299
04:46:07,619 --> 04:46:39,099
I'm gonna put it on stream this is what's making that noise it's bald let's

1300
04:46:39,099 --> 04:46:54,659
say that one more time bird watching stream holy shit what an incredible idea

1301
04:46:54,659 --> 04:46:59,979
I would go out there with like telephoto lens and try to capture birds and stuff

1302
04:46:59,979 --> 04:47:20,380
gone on image I mean I love that idea you get bored really quick yeah but I

1303
04:47:20,380 --> 04:47:27,119
did build a bird house on stream and how long was that stream like three hours

1304
04:47:27,119 --> 04:47:40,279
four hours right was eight it was eight hours okay if I if I build a bird house

1305
04:47:40,279 --> 04:47:49,880
for eight hours I can watch birds before you do it was a full workday to do one

1306
04:47:49,880 --> 04:48:03,569
bird house yesterday not everything needs to be streamed today bird watching

1307
04:48:03,569 --> 04:48:10,360
is a go I think that has to be streamed I think that's something that's been

1308
04:48:10,360 --> 04:48:25,259
important to be streamed put a picture of that bird in the house I don't even

1309
04:48:25,299 --> 04:48:31,720
know that bird is but I don't even know what kind of bird that is now I like my

1310
04:48:31,720 --> 04:48:46,020
city painting thing the problem with bird watching at least I mean around

1311
04:48:46,020 --> 04:48:56,400
here it's there's not birds like that around here this chickadees and I mean

1312
04:48:56,400 --> 04:49:03,319
there are roadrunners out here though and those are awesome so it would turn

1313
04:49:03,319 --> 04:49:09,610
into a road running watching stream and Ravens there's like these big-ass crows

1314
04:49:09,650 --> 04:49:16,119
and Ravens out here like Hawks and Condors and there's a lot of cool birds

1315
04:49:16,119 --> 04:49:34,810
out here what am I talking about let's do it 30 hours in he's still on the

1316
04:49:34,810 --> 04:49:51,439
Aqua teen house not the Aqua teen house anymore come on here would be a good

1317
04:49:51,439 --> 04:50:02,630
stream I'm what I'll do it I'm looking forward to it I have to find the right

1318
04:50:02,630 --> 04:50:07,720
equipment to be able to have you guys able to watch some type of telephoto

1319
04:50:07,720 --> 04:50:11,119
lens that I can get real close in or like a binocular thing that can be fed

1320
04:50:11,119 --> 04:50:17,470
to a stream because if I go bird watching that means I have to do on

1321
04:50:17,509 --> 04:50:27,069
location like IRL backpack type shit right how would I connect I got a

1322
04:50:27,069 --> 04:50:36,799
kind of like a lens that sounds expensive that's alright if it's if it's

1323
04:50:36,799 --> 04:50:54,040
worth it to stream you know the story hold it a few times tell it again but I

1324
04:50:54,040 --> 04:51:00,080
liquidated my retirement account to do the German rumble that that's what I

1325
04:51:00,080 --> 04:51:12,959
mean like it was worth doing I'm gonna do it just watch bird videos instead

1326
04:51:12,959 --> 04:51:25,740
that's not that that's not the row that's gonna be the real thing well all

1327
04:51:25,779 --> 04:51:31,150
right cool connect camera would be a USB to a laptop and use the webcam to see

1328
04:51:31,150 --> 04:51:42,119
on a PC no I'm not gonna aim the webcam and the laptop at a bird I would need to

1329
04:51:42,119 --> 04:51:46,979
use I need to get like a camera hold holding it up and like pointing the

1330
04:51:46,979 --> 04:51:54,709
laptop webcam you would see nothing it would be so pixelated and horrible

1331
04:51:54,709 --> 04:52:07,000
GoPros maybe I feel like I would be the unlucky asshole that had a GoPro attached

1332
04:52:07,000 --> 04:52:12,479
to his head and a camera and I ended up getting chased by a rhino it would be

1333
04:52:12,479 --> 04:52:21,630
just a horrible footage of me just running away screaming that happened

1334
04:52:21,630 --> 04:52:41,509
this room's got to change this room's terrible I don't know rhinos and there's

1335
04:52:41,509 --> 04:52:48,779
no rhinos native to Las Vegas no there aren't I don't know maybe who knows a

1336
04:52:48,779 --> 04:52:56,229
bigfoot apparently still exists and no one's been able to see him that doesn't

1337
04:52:56,229 --> 04:53:03,709
mean he can't kill you they've been looking for him for a long time and he's

1338
04:53:03,709 --> 04:53:41,630
still he's kills people in the woods hmm let's go in cabinets cabinet

1339
04:53:41,630 --> 04:53:49,720
teleporter they're not symmetrical it cares table need like a little runner

1340
04:53:49,720 --> 04:53:59,520

1344
04:54:42,930 --> 04:55:07,650
by the way with this no this room now has a completely different context that

1345
04:55:07,650 --> 04:55:12,229
I don't want any I thought I wanted to be just like the weird porn room in the

1457
05:20:41,099 --> 05:20:57,970
been about six hours when I started 1015 1030 you still have two empty rooms are

1458
05:20:57,970 --> 05:21:13,540
yeah yeah yeah yeah well let's finish this finishes finishes it's been 45

1459
05:21:13,540 --> 05:21:19,189
minutes I think of just what we were just doing so that's probably accurate

1460
05:21:19,189 --> 05:21:42,180
you can't even walk in I can't even look at this room anymore I can't even look

1461
05:21:42,180 --> 05:21:45,610
at that room anymore I can't look at this room anymore it has a completely

1462
05:21:45,610 --> 05:22:00,419
different fucked up context for me now about to burn it I want something here

1463
05:22:00,419 --> 05:22:57,459

1464
05:22:57,459 --> 05:23:05,099

1465
05:23:05,099 --> 05:23:19,939
had to burn that room though I had to get it out of me that room that room

1466

1469
05:23:50,580 --> 05:24:09,700

1470
05:24:09,700 --> 05:24:14,150
save though that's a great question I don't think it really matters

1471
05:24:14,150 --> 05:24:20,369
considering we didn't do anything for about the last 32 straight minutes so

1472
05:24:20,369 --> 05:24:31,369
there's no there's no improvements or problems I have I still have the 3DO I

1473
05:24:31,369 --> 05:24:34,250
got to pull that out there's at least three or four games on the 3DO that we

1474
05:24:34,250 --> 05:24:58,880
have to play only custom robo matters yeah we're good look

1475
05:24:59,040 --> 05:25:07,709
everything looks in order yeah I remember that I remember this everything

1476
05:25:07,709 --> 05:25:15,180
seems to be in order barrels are still here everything's still here

1477
