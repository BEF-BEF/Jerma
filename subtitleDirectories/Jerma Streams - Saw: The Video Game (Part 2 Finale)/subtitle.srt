91
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:55,380
there's one there. All right. I don't even. I don't want to do this anymore. I would rather play

92
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:25,799
Ratatouille. I'd rather show my fucking beehive nuts on stream than do this. Up. Up. Up. Up.

93
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:47,509
What a pain in the ass. What a total pain in the ass. I don't fucking know if this is even

00:27:47,509 --> 00:28:01,799
right. It's just not even right. I'm back. I'm begging you. This stream isn't funny anymore.

95
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:17,349
Ratatouille is funnier. Fuck please. So like all right you know like you dig like the Saw video

96
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:26,599
game. I know everyone wanted me to complete this but this is dog shit. Let's be honest. We gotta

97
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:32,839
be completely upfront. Doing like the pipe dream puzzle over and over again like a thousand times.

98
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:51,509
This game just sucks. I should really just run around and get all the couplers. Mad because bad.

99
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:58,220
No I'm. I am bad. You're right. But oh my god. Why do you want. Who wants to do like five of these

100
00:28:58,220 --> 00:30:08,440
in a row with a timer. All right quiet. Get them all connected. Do it right. Got it. I need this

101
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,049
connected. I need this connected to something. Where's the power? I need this connected. What

102
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:47,180
the fuck am I going to connect this to? Oh you piece of shit. It's like a dumb ass fucking game.

103
00:30:47,180 --> 00:31:00,410
Dumbest fucking game on Twitch right now. This is not connected to shit. How do I get this? I gotta

104
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:31,539
fucking. Okay connected to that. Now this is. This goes up. How do I connect you? That took too long.

105
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:40,549
I got like three. I got two minutes left to do like eight other puzzles. Who made this game?

106
00:31:40,549 --> 00:32:14,569
I'm embarrassed for them. Go outside in. Go out. I turned it off. Are there cheat codes for this game?

107
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:22,680
Just a cheat and his fucking no clip through the door. There's four of those puzzles. There's five

108
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,599
puzzles in seven minutes. That means I have to do every puzzle in less than one minute.

109
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:41,500
Is that even possible to do that in seven minutes? This has to be the last room of the game.

110
00:32:55,619 --> 00:33:05,539
You wish. It's just too. It's too much man. It's just too. It's too. It's too many things to look at.

111
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:10,099
It's too confusing. It's just. Shut up. Turn the fucking TV off. I don't want to hear him anymore.

112
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:26,200
My brain's like too tired to do this. I hate this. I hate these puzzles too by the way.

113
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,920
Of all the puzzles they could be. These are like my least favorite.

114
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:54,869
Okay. I'm gonna be. I'm all right. Like this shit over here. Like this shit right here.

115
00:33:54,869 --> 00:34:11,239
This one going here. This one going over. I don't know. Fuck. I don't know. This one has to go up.

116
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:39,059
And what do I do about this shit here? Outside in dude. Outside in dude. Outside in dude.

117
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:48,420
All right. Outside in dude. All right. Yeah. Outside in dude. Outside in. Something gets

00:34:48,420 --> 00:35:16,739
fucked up here though. There's no outside in. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Because once

119
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:22,860
I get this it's going to take like a minute or two to do this. There's one more. Come on.

120
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:41,929
Oh fuck off with this bullshit. All right. Go. Did I get it? Get it. Take it.

All right. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

122
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:57,400

123
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,800
Like that's going to fucking happen in four minutes.

124
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:43,340
Turn it. No. Get away. God. You need a circuit box. Let's put three of the same stupid dog shit

125
00:36:43,420 --> 00:38:04,519
puzzle right back to back. Six minutes. This is fun. Outside in. Oh this one. No. No. No.

130
00:38:48,340 --> 00:39:10,019
happened? How do I do this? I got it wrong somewhere. This one thing wrong. I don't even

131
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:16,739
know where the fuck it is. This is connected to here. This is connected to there. This has

132
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:21,380
to be connected here. This has to be connected to here. But then you lose this fucking thing.

158
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:29,110
middle does not connect anything down there. This is looks all right. I got to turn the one that's

159
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:43,800
blinking right now over to the left. Okay. Then I got to get the one right below it be like this.

160
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:54,539
Okay. Turn that one down there. Good. This next one, remember this is a children's game. It's

00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:57,340
right at M for mature. You can't even go in and your parents don't have to buy this for you. Bad

162
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,920
parent, bad parent. And then it comes out of there, goes down and then it goes this way.

163
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:16,389
And then it goes up. Yes. Okay. This one goes which way? Left. Good. And it goes straight over

164
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:25,849
and this one goes down like this. And then this one goes up. The one down here goes up, up.

with a chainsaw there's the other chainsaw I know he's coming where is he

295
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:21,529
you would have solved it faster if you had just done your strategy of counting

296
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:30,229
up from zero that actually would have happened you're right that's ridiculous

297
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:45,239
you're right what the hell's even in here crowbar I got a better weapon

302
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:37,729
ever put a light bulb in your ass it'll get stuck and you can't get it out

303
01:21:37,729 --> 01:21:41,010
without breaking it and explodes the safest way to remove the bulb without

304
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:45,409
maiming yourself is to feed a banana around the bulb what the fuck are you

305
01:21:45,409 --> 01:22:05,020
talking about a gear I don't know what who's gonna do that why would anybody

306
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:14,539
do that what you're describing no one would ever do what you just said no one

307
01:22:14,539 --> 01:22:29,510
not one person gonna turn that shit off how do I get that how do I get this how

more than 500 attendees I don't think so that answer is no I don't think so

332
01:28:51,539 --> 01:29:19,500
probably not I don't think it would god oh god no this is the end of the movie

333
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:34,140
this is gonna be absolute hell this has to move forward this is before this is

334
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:52,449
back right back it up shit let's go forward this is to go get enough room

335
01:29:52,449 --> 01:30:21,420
to move this I have to move this one forward pull back no pull it back you

336
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:34,000
idiot use of Molotov good idea all right I should be bad I should be fine for a

337
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:53,210
minute I can't even see anything this default Photoshop fucking hair a brush

338
01:30:53,210 --> 01:31:16,880
thing is I can't see just do it again so I'm not even doing this right throw

339
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:34,539
them all tough please how the hell you supposed to do anything like this this

340
01:31:34,539 --> 01:31:39,159
is like getting up in the morning when I was living in Massachusetts if you go to

341
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:43,560
your car and you clear your car with snow and just looks like this you turn

342
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,960
the car on you to sit in the fucking driver's seat and this is the view you

343
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:54,100
get no I guess I'll make sure to plan an extra 35 minutes before I can drive the

344
01:31:54,100 --> 01:32:08,640
car this is ridiculous I mean what point do you just I die do I not die I could

345
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:18,359
just a little bit I could see out that this is gonna be really really annoying

346
01:32:18,359 --> 01:32:32,310
this is gonna suck you know that traffic game those of you that don't didn't see

347
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:37,130
the last stream of this game months ago it's that traffic game where you have to

348
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:41,930
move move move move and then get the one car to the left all the way over it's

349
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:56,689
a cult gridlock yeah yeah yeah it's stupid all the rush hour yeah all right

350
01:32:56,689 --> 01:33:05,819
I'm gonna we gotta go from the back let him monologue for a second it's okay so

351
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:12,550
this one's got to move to the right so if this has got to move up to move this

352
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:19,350
one up this one has to move up move that one up these two need to move all the

353
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:26,920
way over this needs to move all the way over so to do that this needs to move up

354
01:33:26,920 --> 01:34:04,159
this we mean this is right I have to move that good this thing has to get the

355
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:23,159
hell out of the way this moves all the way over this reason why you can't just

356
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:38,489
push and hold dude you can't just push and hold come on hurry up I almost got

357
01:34:38,489 --> 01:34:56,539
it go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go push it fucking hurry

358
01:34:56,539 --> 01:35:18,239
I'm trying fucking hurry I'm hurrying come on come on that's it that's it go

359
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:31,460
go go go go go go go go okay get in oh to the heat why are you guys doing

360
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:34,340
question you guys are question marking me in the beginning that's the only way

361
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:52,619
I was gonna be able to move them all I gotta go he sounds drunk I guess he's

362
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:56,939
probably just been sitting there drinking whiskey what if he just like

363
01:35:56,939 --> 01:36:05,149
falls asleep I can just walk through all the traps it's been in-game in-universe

364
01:36:05,149 --> 01:36:14,670
it's been probably like seven hours in here this dude's probably blasted this

365
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:26,350
way Julie falls asleep I got one I gotta get number two number two is in the

366
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:50,369
staff housing room now where the hell is that the freezer my lighter back staff

367
01:36:50,369 --> 01:37:07,859
room effectively you see a circle none of these are even marked yeah the dude is

368
01:37:07,859 --> 01:37:18,939
sloshed

369
01:37:39,029 --> 01:38:06,000
oh I got a gas trap does that sound I feel like the staff room was back here

370
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
all the way back here guys I thought that was like 30 minutes left of this

371
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:13,840
game there's like two and a half hours left actually I would blame the first

372
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:20,600
hour of this transitioning to here on on the stupid puzzle thing that I got stuck

373
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:25,369
on the seven and a half minute room seven minutes room like on the wrong way

374
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:47,260
look for the staff room oh don't kill me I feel the same way when I

375
01:38:47,300 --> 01:39:08,050
laugh at the streamer all right staff room what does it say

376
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:12,869
cafeteria is that way security is that way I think we have to go all the way

377
01:39:12,869 --> 01:39:43,659
back staff housing I was right I was right yeah check point yeah oh shit

378
01:39:43,659 --> 01:40:09,050
before I had to kind of explode pretty good I'm utilizing the traps we're going

379
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:18,840
to touch it you know the sound that it makes when you take a picture with a

380
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:26,369
disposable flash camera that's what that is that's an industry secret want to let

381
01:40:26,369 --> 01:40:37,380
you guys in on it that didn't do it that time but you don't know what it goes you

382
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:50,619
guys know the one to the left and the right down each path is the light what's

383
01:40:50,619 --> 01:40:54,979
your name and the light no put your faith in the light it's a name how would

384
01:40:54,979 --> 01:41:04,220
that matter they can't put your name in the light I can't see what jigsaw chest

385
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:31,710
it's open it a strap and ammonia I even open those fucking useless didn't know

386
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:37,630
anything about saw to saw to as much as of a train wreck as this game is

387
01:41:37,630 --> 01:42:02,880
actually yes I'm hungry oh man what are we doing food today boys and girls what

388
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:18,529

390
01:42:21,329 --> 01:42:45,229
there we are hmm on this puzzle in the games

391
01:42:45,229 --> 01:43:17,850
that wasn't too bad my big lane red lobster no I'd rather be able to hold in

392
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:21,489
whatever it goes down and not have it come up immediately about 30 minutes

393
01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:40,409
later I say that my opinion so I feel that's my personal opinion on the

394
01:43:40,409 --> 01:44:04,199
matter go to go to a restaurant and order bread for food just get bread just

395
01:44:04,199 --> 01:44:08,319
eat bread for the fucking appetizer for the main course desserts eat the bread

396
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:18,989
eat cheddar biscuit bread I don't even order the lobster why would you just eat

397
01:44:18,989 --> 01:44:36,750
the ethos oh those cheddar biscuits oh no it's not armed what kind of glass why

398
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:56,420
what those cheddar biscuits though right you shake don't tell anybody

399
01:44:56,420 --> 01:45:01,520

402
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:17,970

403
01:45:17,970 --> 01:45:25,460
why do people have to pretend to like food just eat it who cares I know it's

404
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,939
good it's probably good just eat it you don't have to like pretend like it's

405
01:45:27,939 --> 01:45:52,119
cool god what's so much different than everybody else we're quirky I can't say

707
03:03:56,770 --> 03:04:01,309
of times that I have gotten killed by that shotgun trap kind of have to expect

710
03:04:58,219 --> 03:05:12,120
too in like four months it was all right I did say that I hated the game I said

711
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:22,309
that I think I said this is the worst game I've ever streamed that's kind of

712
03:05:22,309 --> 03:05:45,879
harsh I think let's do freedom wait I can't would be 714 right right behind the

03:06:39,569 --> 03:07:01,700
go freedom what is this one but I'm still obsessed with it I can't get over

717
03:07:02,340 --> 03:07:42,040
