00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:05,549

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Those are his boots. All right. What does he have here?

119
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,610
All right, let's just hide this so he'll never find them

120
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,679
No, that's okay. What if it was his dick

121
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:26,639
His jam

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:56,450

I told you I wanted to do like a fun character that helped in the children's book that this would be a part of

137
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:12,019
They would be counting these right now

155
00:22:51,940 --> 00:23:09,619
Yeah, i'm going for the hat. I'm gonna hide in the fucking cabbage. I had to I just did that because I felt like it

161
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:56,430
Does he have to lean down for that?

162
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,910
No, he's got to do something

Hold on

170
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:48,779
Throw it into the lake

171
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:53,869
Look, you can have this back

172
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,430
He's bald. Yeah, that's not a hat. That's a toupee

173
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,980
I try let me can I run this over the lawnmower?

174
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:29,329
Aha, there it is. He puts it on rake in the lake

175
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:39,490
You got it. I gotta steal this way so he doesn't see me

176
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,900
I can't take that hat. Never mind

177
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:36,160
Rake in the lake here it goes. Oh, this the pic the picnic is right here a new to-do list item has shown up

178
00:26:36,480 --> 00:27:05,180
Here we go. Hold on. I have an idea. Can I get it up there if I can turn this?

179
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:20,400
This might work. Come on vault over this fence. Now. He's just flexing

180
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
To who there's nobody watching

181
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,160
Doesn't a flex require somebody else to flex on?

182
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:36,609
That's all right. I'll just leave it in the lake. All right, have a picnic make the groundskeeper hammer his thumb

183
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,569
All right, let's get a picnic going first

184
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:52,160
There's the apple

185
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,720
Streamer hates his viewer. Wait, what are you talking about? What do I do?

186
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:01,470
Uh, I said highway to backsplash. Thanks for the five thousand bits

187
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,250
From a little earlier. Thank you

188
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,170
Five thousand bits fifty dollars coming in from highway to backsplash. They said

189
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:11,970
Jeremy you completely outdid yourself with the carnival stream

190
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:17,650
However, I was disappointed to see that you didn't put your middle finger out the window during the clown car crash like you promised

191
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:25,009
That's all right, though. It still happened

192
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:31,940
Who's calling me? I have no idea who this is

193
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,009
And when we don't know

194
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:43,869

195
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:45,869
All right. Now I need

196
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:49,390
Blanket pumpkin. Oh, all right. I gotta go back in this garden get the pumpkins and shit

197
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,579
That was rude

198
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,650
I don't know. I don't know who that is

199
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:11,089
It's probably a scammer

200
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:13,490
All right carrot pumpkin jam

201
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:16,930
Thermos radio, I gotta take all this guy's stuff

202
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:24,880
Just take one of each

203
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,000
Wait, doesn't he knew I took how did you count them? How did you know I took one?

204
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,799
Is he going to the picnic to take wait a minute? He's not actually gonna do that, is he?

205
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:48,339
Get out of here what's more important what's more important pumpkin of the rose? Oh, yeah, so i'll just take this thing then

206
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,490
My dog does this shit

207
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,130
Hey, give me that back now. Give me this and then let's go grab something else completely unrelated and run away

208
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,940
Feels like a toy. Hey, give me that toy

209
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:28,500
Okay, fine. I'll take this

210
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:44,589
Wait, I got it. All right, I gotta steal I gotta get pumpkins gonna be hard to get

211
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:09,180
uh

212
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,539
Now this would be cute if I invite him to the picnic afterwards, right?

213
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,750
That's the last panel of the book

214
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:24,349
And he goes what is this? What happened? Am I these are my things these are my things

215
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,039

216
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,349
Okay

217
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,349

218
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,250

And thermos this is a big picnic. All right thermo. I think this is I gotta make that look nicer than it does

220
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:59,420
It looks terrible right now

221
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:07,170
Wait and his toupee

222
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,650
And the rose. No, i'm not gonna do that. It's weird

223
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,740
Where's the picnic blanket?

224
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:27,299
You have a sign that says no ducks, but i've been here the whole time just hanging out

225
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,900
Why would you not be freaking out that i'm in here yet?

226
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,440
How do I get up there?

227
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:50,700
There it is

228
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:57,539
Don't certain animals do this shit though? I was really

229
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:01,380
There's an animal that actually comes and steals stuff from your house

230
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,500
What is it?

231
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,299

232
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:11,710

They'll take like bracelets jewelry

234
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:18,980
What is in here? I can hide in this

235
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:31,519
Good luck finding this

236
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,519

239
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,039
Can I not pick the radio up?

240
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:08,110
Okay. Well, this works

241
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,570
Wow, this is the blanket. All right bring

To the picnic blanket make the groundskeeper hammer his thumb

243
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:26,940
How do I do that? How do I get him to hammer anything?

244
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:38,719
That duck

245
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,360
So does he is he doing like a ai loop? Is he gonna pick the hammer up?

246
00:34:48,289 --> 00:35:03,329
Wait, how do I get him to hammer his thumb? Do I have to scare him before he swings?

247
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,130
No, look what I look what I did

248
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,639
What no, this is working way better than I wanted to come look over here

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:42,210
All right, you know what i'm just gonna let him finish what he's doing he'll see it eventually

250
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960

those of you that um we talked a lot about the carnival earlier and i wanted to reiterate one

808
03:30:50,370 --> 03:31:01,790
more time that you can expect something like that to happen every few months now that shit is already

809

we're already starting to work on a talk on the next one not carnival life i'm just saying just

817
03:32:10,799 --> 03:32:28,190
why would you be angry at this this is just depositing free money into your checking account

818
03:32:28,190 --> 03:32:34,219
all you have to do is film it it's an awesome goose it doesn't understand what money is

819
03:32:34,940 --> 03:32:47,200
and then you could just buy the goose a gigantic goose house and put all the things that goose

846
03:42:57,340 --> 03:43:02,139
you put a bunch of glass down you break a bunch of glass bottles and you make him walk in the room

847
03:43:02,139 --> 03:43:06,940
and you scare him and he lands and he sits on them it's horrible it's kind of out of place in

another one of these games i want another one right i want i want another game like this i'm

884
03:56:39,489 --> 03:56:47,420
hungry for more can this be one of those stories where the developer made this just goofy game and

885
03:56:47,420 --> 03:56:56,180
oh that was fun just a funny little game and then they get like three million dollars in funding to

886
03:56:56,180 --> 03:57:07,459
do it again do it with different animals yeah do like a bear untitled bear game what would wait

887
03:57:07,459 --> 03:57:21,549
probably not as a rat you can make a lot of fun scenarios instead of a little squeak it's that

888
03:57:21,549 --> 03:57:29,500
loud bear scream i would love to just eat out of people's trash and by the way there's i'm

889
03:57:29,500 --> 03:57:35,659
gonna give you a i'm gonna call the back of the box the tell us how we're doing comments that's

890
03:57:35,659 --> 03:57:40,219
on the back of randomly for some reason like drinks and sodas and shit you don't remember that

891
03:57:40,219 --> 03:57:45,020
stuff all right you there's a honk button there's a grab button that needs to be also a swallow

892
03:57:45,020 --> 03:57:51,870
button i'm gonna be able to eat this stuff like i need to be able to chew this and swallow and eat

893
03:57:51,870 --> 03:58:05,440
it that'd be fun no no dedicated shit button that's not what i mean i'm just i want to be able to

894
03:58:05,440 --> 03:58:10,420
just chew stuff up i'm gonna be able to pull the slipper off the guy's foot and just chew it up

895
03:58:10,420 --> 03:58:21,260
have i played the cat lateral damage i actually have this i like this more than that though that

896
03:58:21,260 --> 03:58:29,870
game is more just to make a mess for 30 seconds this is just walk around and be a duck and this

897
03:58:29,870 --> 03:58:35,250
is more charming to me than the goat simulator was you know i i'm gonna give you a stamp of

898
03:58:35,250 --> 03:58:50,379
recommendation on this one this it's cute it's cute enough but that is probably it's actually

899
03:58:50,379 --> 03:58:54,750
probably gonna do it for today i have a couple things i need to get done i have to get ready

900
03:58:54,750 --> 03:59:11,090
for twitchcon i have to pack i am going to stream tomorrow so this is not just the only stream we're

901
03:59:11,090 --> 03:59:23,329
gonna get this week i'll see you guys tomorrow tomorrow is it kind of also up in the air this

902
03:59:23,329 --> 03:59:28,129
was just a random game that turned out this is i had a lot of fun this is great uh tomorrow is

903
03:59:28,129 --> 03:59:32,459
going to be similar though i don't really have much of a plan haven't really been around i just

904
03:59:32,459 --> 03:59:40,180
kind of got back been out of i've been out of the i don't even know what games have come out i don't

905
03:59:40,180 --> 03:59:46,209
even know what's released in the last like week and a half or so so we'll do something for at

906
03:59:46,209 --> 03:59:57,649
least like a good five six hours tomorrow before i have to leave i'll figure it out community

907
03:59:57,649 --> 04:00:03,250
content stream tomorrow uh i don't think so i think it's too early for that i want to give

908
04:00:03,250 --> 04:00:08,129
people at least a few weeks at least a month or so to really get the first one nice and meaty

909
04:00:10,190 --> 04:00:17,260
we'll figure it out but again i want to make this very clear too my stream schedule is pulling back

910
04:00:17,979 --> 04:00:22,540
remember four or five months ago when i talked about after the carnival stream

911
04:00:23,360 --> 04:00:30,700
i was going to start to pull the streams back an hour or two streams are going to be starting

912
04:00:33,010 --> 04:00:37,409
an hour or two early than they are than they happen so instead of like three to four

913
04:00:38,049 --> 04:00:48,299
pacific it's going to be somewhere around like two like one to two pacific so between like four and

914
04:00:48,299 --> 04:00:54,559
five eastern is where i want the streams to start from now on and i've talked about a little bit

915
04:00:54,559 --> 04:01:03,219
more the streams because i'm on pacific time if i stream till like 10 11 12 at night it's really

916
04:01:03,219 --> 04:01:08,690
really late for everybody if people watch from europe there it's like six o'clock in the morning

917
04:01:09,790 --> 04:01:13,229
eastern time it's like two three o'clock in the morning so i'm going to pull it back

918
04:01:16,139 --> 04:01:42,020
and with that guys we are going to transition to uh hold on a second hold on the new outro screen

919
04:01:44,930 --> 04:01:52,430
thanks for coming everybody appreciate everybody's uh coming in good shit oops i

920
04:01:52,430 --> 04:01:58,750
fucked it up i screwed it up you weren't supposed to see that hold on there we are

921
04:01:59,389 --> 04:02:03,340
everybody welcomed uh please don't throw your popcorn at the screen

922
04:02:03,340 --> 04:02:11,090
i appreciate if you wouldn't please make a a formal exit on the left side there are your exits

923
04:02:14,239 --> 04:02:20,700
and uh thanks for coming up i need to figure out how this works because this is the first

924
04:02:20,700 --> 04:02:29,229
time i've tried it don't throw tomatoes at me either either hold on peter let me figure this

925
04:02:29,229 --> 04:02:38,270
out because this name is up here i don't think this is i think i screwed this up

926
04:02:39,149 --> 04:02:56,819
did i screw this up maybe not oh i definitely messed it up somehow i'll figure it out next

927
04:03:00,049 --> 04:03:10,399
but this will have all the the highest bit tip of the day whoever gave the highest

928
04:03:11,739 --> 04:03:15,180
and then on the right side it'll be the whoever gave the most during that

929
04:03:15,180 --> 04:03:19,899
period and then the top sub gifter on the left i actually might try to cycle these out too

930
04:03:20,700 --> 04:03:27,920
maybe i'll do like today's bit leader and then have like longest running gifted the longest running

931
04:03:27,920 --> 04:03:34,459
sub or something like top sub gifting so many people give gifted subs that it's almost like

932
04:03:34,459 --> 04:03:52,100
it's its own category 10 000 but this also this track loradale made all this i've been sitting

933
04:03:52,100 --> 04:04:02,430
on it for a while i love this out this song is great i will get these correct here's the

934
04:04:02,430 --> 04:04:19,469
cool thing about this though everybody has left see you later guys only a few of you still in

935
04:04:19,469 --> 04:04:36,370
here i can also get rid of those people too it's a rat then we can hang out here by the way the

936
04:04:36,370 --> 04:04:44,430
screen up there i can drop the music and we can put something up there pictures random videos

937
04:04:44,430 --> 04:04:57,149
stuff like that how cool is this though the germaplexis cinema is the janitor

938
04:04:57,870 --> 04:05:13,649
you wait yeah you guys could do a webcam in there too yeah there's the rat still clean it up and

939
04:05:13,649 --> 04:05:27,870
then janitor can finish up over here and then take a look at this it's over why are we inside of your

940
04:05:27,870 --> 04:05:41,040
mouth that's a great question so this is the first of quite a few of these i gotta get back in touch

941
04:05:41,040 --> 04:05:46,000
with loradale and we'll do the next few parts there's gonna be a lot of tracks a lot of audio

942
04:05:46,000 --> 04:05:56,559
a bunch of new transition scenes i'm trying to really get it going but yeah i will figure out

943
04:05:56,559 --> 04:06:13,729
how i messed that up somehow rip the old outro that is not true still here because that plays

944
04:06:14,770 --> 04:06:32,620
when the stream is actually over and we can come back over to here while we just hang out i do want

945
04:06:32,620 --> 04:06:44,530
to add a bunch of things but these are fucking fantastic as they are now get a couple more

946
04:06:44,530 --> 04:06:58,219

990
04:13:50,940 --> 04:13:54,780

991
04:13:54,780 --> 04:14:04,659
thank you whatever it is they were i'm really sorry to hear that thank you so much for the

992
04:14:04,659 --> 04:14:17,309
five dollars i'm glad you like the videos in the content and the community too this is a great

993
04:14:17,309 --> 04:14:28,819
community people here are great that's pretty fucking rare don't forget that it's important

994
04:14:28,819 --> 04:14:34,850
but seriously thank you so much for the five bucks oh right i'm sorry i'm supposed to be putting

995
04:14:34,850 --> 04:14:52,049
things here i gotta make some stuff to put in there you need to shave my face cam that's right

996
04:14:53,659 --> 04:14:58,219
uh i gotta stream labs obs is kind of weird i have to figure out how to do this stuff

997
04:14:58,940 --> 04:15:06,700
because it's when you add a source the sources already exists it's kind of i think it's gonna

998
04:15:06,700 --> 04:15:17,139
take some getting used to oh yes uh by the way this is i i didn't this is how i've been sitting

999
04:15:17,139 --> 04:15:30,850
in here for a very long time i'm just realizing this right now so uh this is a fucking this is a

1000
04:15:30,850 --> 04:15:50,700
weird movie hey all of you come back in the theater it's not done yet um we had alchemy can

1001
04:15:51,940 --> 04:15:57,219
thousand bits from alchemy can 10 bucks thanks for the carnival man here's for you and your

1002
04:15:57,219 --> 04:16:03,889
team's work we all appreciate it a lot of time went into that and a lot of people were involved

1003
04:16:03,889 --> 04:16:12,190
even just the robots alone trying to figure out what i wanted to do and could that translate to

1004
04:16:12,190 --> 04:16:22,190
actually have it on video and camera we when we were when we were setting up the inputs i remember

1005
04:16:22,190 --> 04:16:30,299
just going uh to the one of the engineers i was like so um how much can that handle how much can

1006
04:16:30,299 --> 04:16:35,500
you actually handle in this thing how many inputs per second i was like because it's probably gonna

1007
04:16:35,500 --> 04:16:43,659
be like it's probably gonna be like a thousand inputs a second and i remember his his eyes kind

1008
04:16:43,659 --> 04:16:52,989
of widening him going oh shit okay so we should let me see if i can figure that out god i think

1009
04:16:52,989 --> 04:16:58,930
that it really and that was by the way probably two or three hours before the stream started

1010
04:16:58,930 --> 04:17:03,569
because we were planning on thinking how we were going to do it should i have sub only turned on

1011
04:17:03,569 --> 04:17:08,370
no i don't really want to do that because that's i'd rather have as many people participate as

1012
04:17:08,370 --> 04:17:13,649
possible because it's more chaotic right it's more fun that way but do i need to mitigate the amount

1013
04:17:13,649 --> 04:17:22,290
of inputs that come in because the machines physically cannot take it chat went so fast my

1014
04:17:22,290 --> 04:17:28,540
feed was buffering yeah i put on a little slow mode just to try to help there was a couple of

1015
04:17:28,540 --> 04:17:34,659
points when i think this you guys broke the server they were connected to and that's when i had to

1016
04:17:34,659 --> 04:17:46,700
kill time for 10 straight minutes sometimes but it was worth it it was worth it there was more

1017
04:17:46,700 --> 04:17:56,700
than 16 000 people there i know it's a rat um yeah i think it was it was almost at 16 5 17 000

1018
04:17:56,700 --> 04:18:03,299
concurrent that's the highest i've ever had ever i think it just blew it completely blew it away

1019
04:18:03,299 --> 04:18:24,780
where did you find those clowns they were they were in the area the old one was like 12k now it

1020
04:18:24,780 --> 04:18:32,989
it blew past my previous high of viewers that came in a lot of new people too and even i mean

carnival stream seemed too good to be free so here's what i can give thanks for the laughs

1057
04:23:42,420 --> 04:23:51,299
carnival stream um i would not have put a payment on that there's no way i would have done that

1058
04:23:51,860 --> 04:23:59,920
i wanted as many people to come check it out as possible i'm not putting a pay to watch

1059
04:23:59,920 --> 04:24:05,200
or pay to participate i just i don't want to do that i'd rather have as many people as possible

1060
04:24:05,200 --> 04:24:11,360
see it that's more important to me than trying to make extra money i i guess i don't really

1061
04:24:11,360 --> 04:24:18,370
that doesn't could i have like sub gated that or something but what the fuck do i carry you

1062
04:24:18,370 --> 04:24:23,090
know i mean i don't i don't i'd rather have people watch it than have um it be sub gated or

1063
04:24:23,090 --> 04:24:36,819
something more publicity yeah i mean i guess that's normal what i was thinking of when i wanted to do

1064
04:24:36,819 --> 04:24:40,659
this though was not how do i i want to get all of it everywhere how do i get on the front page of

1065
04:24:40,659 --> 04:24:51,280
every page that just was something that i wanted to do i'm happy it was received well i'm very happy

1066
04:24:51,920 --> 04:24:57,040
i mean if it was received really poorly then that's a completely different story

1067
04:24:57,760 --> 04:25:05,139
and then i have to come up here and embarrassingly turn this stream on and say yep uh

1115
04:31:31,809 --> 04:31:39,090
go completely fucking wrong and nobody will think it's funny and nobody will think it was interesting

1116
04:31:39,090 --> 04:31:47,889
and i'm just sitting there going get get up get out of here the asmr demon now obviously there

1117
04:31:47,889 --> 04:31:52,690

1118
04:31:52,690 --> 04:31:59,569
too busy and too focused on trying to get it to get together and as time came forward we realized

1119
04:31:59,569 --> 04:32:02,850
that it was going to be a lot of fun so but it doesn't matter like i always just want to make

1120
04:32:02,850 --> 04:32:06,930
sure that people regardless of how much money the stream costs or it doesn't matter if it's that

1121
04:32:06,930 --> 04:32:11,809
stream it could be this stream too the one that you just watched the one that you're on right now

1122
04:32:12,610 --> 04:32:16,750

04:36:59,200 --> 04:37:03,279
time that everyone you're like passionate about this project and then you really really like it

1158
04:37:03,279 --> 04:37:08,159
and you really want to give time to it and care about it and all of them did every single person

1159
04:37:08,159 --> 04:37:15,729
that was there was just having such a fucking blast and that's when it clicks like that no

1160
04:37:15,729 --> 04:37:22,130
there was no scenario where it was oh i really got to run this through this guy and oh no no i

1161
04:37:22,130 --> 04:37:27,810

1163
04:37:34,779 --> 04:37:40,540

1164
04:37:41,439 --> 04:37:49,500

1165
04:37:49,500 --> 04:37:58,979

1185
04:40:44,430 --> 04:40:49,790
and 50 cents 250 bits hi germa me my friend wanted to buy a goat but shipping was like

1186
04:40:49,790 --> 04:40:57,279
70 feels bad man holy shit uh also the carnival stream was amazing i loved it

1187
04:40:59,549 --> 04:41:14,180
70 dollars yeah that ship shipping from america overseas always is an extra at least one to two to

1188
04:41:14,180 --> 04:41:22,720
300 percent wherever it's going i wish i could change it but that's another reason why i like

1189
04:41:22,720 --> 04:41:31,040
to keep my t-shirts cheaper i like to keep all my t-shirts at like 18 to 22 dollars because i know

1190
04:41:31,040 --> 04:41:35,200
you're gonna spend like 30 fucking dollars to have it shipped to you if you're from another country

1191
04:41:40,110 --> 04:41:51,119
so i completely understand those who they bought your shirts from uh from eu how much was the

1192
04:41:51,119 --> 04:42:20,990
shipping is there a like an average 50 20 20 bucks 50 bucks two roblox well i think we got

1193
04:42:20,990 --> 04:42:29,889
two actual answers in there so i think that maybe even one how many people like this there's like

1194
04:42:30,450 --> 04:42:48,880
3200 people here and i get one real answer wow damn all right but thank you again that was uh

1195
04:42:48,959 --> 04:42:52,240
okay ice cream i'm really sorry that you have to spend that much money to get anything shipped

1196
04:42:52,880 --> 04:43:00,450
i wish shipping wasn't so ridiculous for some places hey uh ov peel thanks for the five dollars

1197
04:43:00,450 --> 04:43:08,669
no message just 500 bits egg johnson 500 bits hey germa been watching since 2012 when i was like

1198
04:43:08,669 --> 04:43:15,490
15 and seriously man you've gotten better in your senior 60 plus years you do some avant-garde shit

1199
04:43:15,490 --> 04:43:21,180
and it's insanely inspiring also how do i stop uh cutting myself with a safety razor i do it every

1200
04:43:21,180 --> 04:43:26,860
single time but i've been using it for like two years well it's here's the thing you gotta be very

1201
04:43:26,860 --> 04:43:33,709
very gentle and careful when you shave with a safety razor you gotta let the weight of the blade

1202
04:43:33,709 --> 04:43:41,700
do the work you don't push you don't drag let the weight of the blade do it slight angle gentle

1203
04:43:41,700 --> 04:43:47,139
i know that some people have places to be you got time i don't want to shave it's gonna take 20

1204
04:43:47,139 --> 04:43:57,939
minutes to shave just relax and let just work it gently you don't have to go fast when people

1205
04:43:57,939 --> 04:44:05,279
shave their faces that's why some of these brands they do so well because they have the 12 blades

1206
04:44:05,279 --> 04:44:09,439
and they have all the jelly shit all over it and they've been engineered in a way to make it so

1207
04:44:09,439 --> 04:44:14,590
you can shave your entire face in the same amount of time that it takes to brush your teeth no you

1208
04:44:14,590 --> 04:44:35,180
that should not be what you do that's how you get irritation more blades reduce irritation i'm telling

1209
04:44:35,180 --> 04:44:45,330
you just rip the hair out more blades reduce here too i yeah but they've been engineered and designed

1210
04:44:45,330 --> 04:44:52,060
that way to make it so people just you get i used to know somebody this is fucking crazy by the way

1211
04:44:52,060 --> 04:45:00,939
and this i'm not making this up i knew somebody that shaved with water and it was it was impossible

1212
04:45:00,939 --> 04:45:14,509
to me it was impossible to shave with water they had to have been lying but it wasn't a situation

1213
04:45:14,509 --> 04:45:21,360
where somebody was gonna lie it was just really randomly off the cuff just not being pressed on

1214
04:45:21,759 --> 04:45:27,150
they just mentioned it without it we weren't even we weren't even talking about shaving really

1215
04:45:27,150 --> 04:45:33,279
well i just use water it just came out like oh we talked about just it randomly popped up somewhere

1216
04:45:33,279 --> 04:45:47,380
it wasn't like i can't wait to lie about how i shave my face i use ketchup soap maybe they

1217
04:45:47,380 --> 04:45:59,119
talk maybe they do soap i couldn't do that either though the soap in water i would be so scared i

1218
04:45:59,119 --> 04:46:18,779
have to have a big santa beard of cream before i even begin i thought you meant they shaved literally

1219
04:46:18,779 --> 04:46:25,180
using water no blade no no like they put like they put water on their face and shaved

1220
04:46:25,180 --> 04:46:42,619
their face with the water on their face how that's not even possible what's wrong with just using

1221
04:46:42,619 --> 04:46:53,439
water are you you shave with just water you gotta fill us in that's it freaks me out you do yes you

1222
04:46:53,439 --> 04:47:05,569
do i do i do yes okay how do you not tug it doesn't tug it tugs doesn't it when you shave

1223
04:47:05,569 --> 04:47:23,680
it's like you just do it but you have you just have to pressure the blade carefully you just do

1224
04:47:23,680 --> 04:47:35,229
it i don't i would never shave with just water i would get to a point where i would you can hear

1225
04:47:35,229 --> 04:47:52,259
it it goes like and then you feel a tug and i stop and i go i'm not doing it yeah i don't i

1279
04:56:31,200 --> 04:56:37,439
that you have you consuming way too much sugar cut back a little on the sugar it's not necessary

1329
05:05:01,540 --> 05:05:06,419
the story of my old bones the greatest video ever created there will never be a follow-up

1330
05:05:06,419 --> 05:05:12,740
video to that because the story that has been told the story has been told already there's no need

1331
05:05:13,060 --> 05:05:21,650
than that guy uh that captain uh i don't know the story he's already told it i like how german

1332
05:05:21,650 --> 05:05:30,560
moves out west to do more projects but did a project out east the project started in the west

1333
05:05:31,200 --> 05:05:41,520
by the way hold on a second here it wasn't the east coast okay it was eastern time but it was

1334
05:05:41,520 --> 05:05:46,639
it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't in matt it was not east coast it was like middle of the country

1335
05:05:48,619 --> 05:06:01,490
it was not on the east coast it was eastern time in a central location that would be central time

1336
05:06:01,490 --> 05:06:07,729
no that's not true because in some states uh county by county it changes from central to eastern i

1337
05:06:07,729 --> 05:06:27,090
don't know why so you did it in england you got it is the beautiful great state of indiana this

1338
05:06:27,090 --> 05:06:38,590
guy has a lot of tomatoes why indiana well because it was easy for us to transport the robots

1339
05:06:41,340 --> 05:06:47,200
very very easy there's nothing here there's plenty there what are you talking about

1340
05:06:55,299 --> 05:07:06,930
why not do it indoors why would i do a carnival indoors that would be scary an indoor carnival

1341
05:07:12,900 --> 05:07:23,090
it would be like this if you come into indiana from chicago it smells like a paper mill

1342
05:07:26,299 --> 05:07:37,279
i don't i don't even know what that means do i like west world i love season one of west world

1447

have no words for the carnival stream other than incredibly proud of you keep amazing me every

1448
05:22:06,540 --> 05:22:13,409
elaborate stream also you should totally throw borderlands 3 on your off stream games and also

1449
05:22:13,409 --> 05:22:19,310
was wondering if you were gonna stream or play death stranding also happy birthday thank you for

the birthday wish i appreciate i appreciate that thank you i don't know if i'm gonna play death

1451
05:22:22,909 --> 05:22:31,599
stranding i'm probably not going to play borderlands 3 i didn't really play borderlands 2 i played

1452
05:22:31,599 --> 05:22:36,639
borderlands 1 you know what there i think there's a video of me playing borderlands 2 for like 10

1453
05:22:36,639 --> 05:22:42,740
minutes with like three or four people that's buried somewhere on the channel there's a border

1454
05:22:42,740 --> 05:23:02,419
lands 2 episode 1 let's play how many episodes other this probably two or three two no i just

1455
05:23:02,419 --> 05:23:10,180
have i'm not really into like the whole loot shooter thing anymore i'm looking for something

1456
05:23:10,180 --> 05:23:25,580
else borderlands 3 is a mess right now i i would not know i've not been around but yeah um probably

1457
05:23:25,580 --> 05:23:34,189
not gonna play the uh death stranding on stream i don't think i would do that that's more so that's

1458
05:23:34,189 --> 05:23:38,830
probably something that i would want to do just on my own and just kind of enjoy it kind of like

1459
05:23:38,830 --> 05:23:43,790
what i'm doing with god of war i know i know people can be very mad about this i'm currently

1460
05:23:43,790 --> 05:23:51,060
well not currently but i was currently playing through god of war off stream it's been great

1461
05:23:52,689 --> 05:23:57,330
i know i know i've been there's been a lot of times where i've gone you know i really wish

1462
05:23:57,330 --> 05:24:09,569
stream was on right now because that was awesome let us watch no no because i'm i'm me and kim i'm

1464
05:24:15,970 --> 05:24:21,759
sure i'll play i'll play god of war it's kind of like a little thing that we have right now so

1465
05:24:22,479 --> 05:24:34,130
she's currently enjoying her personal playthrough of god of war yeah it's fun uh we're getting up

1466
05:24:34,209 --> 05:24:44,590
here to the end we got probably another five ten minutes left still a lot of people here too those

1467
05:24:44,590 --> 05:24:50,830
of you that are new uh give you maybe kind of curious of what is going on here but probably

1468
05:24:50,830 --> 05:24:56,990
should have said this in the very beginning of this kind of wind down uh at the end of 95 percent

1469
05:24:56,990 --> 05:25:06,049
of all streams i don't read bits or subs on stream so at the very end of a stream we'll just kind of

1470
05:25:06,130 --> 05:25:11,729
hang out and i'll go over what's come through and respond to messages and stuff like that and we then

1471
05:25:11,729 --> 05:25:18,139
we'd run uh sub credits at the end so that's probably if you were curious as to why you didn't

1472
05:25:18,139 --> 05:25:22,939
see any notifications or you didn't see i wasn't talking to or reacting to any bit messages is

1473
05:25:22,939 --> 05:25:30,259
because i i do i do not do that i also have a twitter too somebody's linked it is my name

1474
05:25:30,259 --> 05:25:45,090
brad no my name is uh my name is jerry elbertson thank you but we were down here at where were we

1475
05:25:45,090 --> 05:25:50,209
yes that was flug boy uh that gave the happy birthday 500 bits and they talked about the

1476
05:25:50,209 --> 05:25:56,049
carnival stream i really appreciate it thank you dubski dude thanks for the 500 bits five dollars

1477
05:25:56,049 --> 05:26:00,830
from dubski dude hey germa i heard you were strapped for cash so here's five whole dollars

1478
05:26:00,830 --> 05:26:05,759
to pay for the carnival stream that should cover most of the expenses no need to thank me but for

1479
05:26:05,759 --> 05:26:11,630
real though i can't believe you pulled it off i was very impressed with the sheer creativity of it

1480
05:26:11,630 --> 05:26:15,869
and i'm not kidding when i say you're a visionary it's great to be able to watch you progress into

1481
05:26:15,869 --> 05:26:24,779
bigger and better skits but the real question is germa tv show when you're watching it right

1482
05:26:24,779 --> 05:26:35,740
now you're you are currently watching it right now you're on the channel this is the channel

1483
05:26:35,740 --> 05:26:49,549
you're on it's germa tv germa 985 tv tv's yeah uh oh so much more goes into tv i i would rather

1484
05:26:49,549 --> 05:26:56,540
just make a few phone calls and say here's an idea that i want to do let's make it happen

1485
05:26:56,990 --> 05:27:04,299
from my channel not for anybody else's i'd rather do that than have like a tv show which this is so

1486
05:27:04,299 --> 05:27:10,909
much more goes into that i'm happy that you liked it i'm glad that you enjoyed it i'm glad that

1487
05:27:10,909 --> 05:27:16,740
people thought it was fun and i'm glad you got to at least win some of the games because i really

1488
05:27:16,740 --> 05:27:22,770
was concerned that you weren't going to do any of them but you did almost all of them i don't think

1489
05:27:22,770 --> 05:27:29,009
there was actually that that kind of knocked the clowns down uh you only got two or three of those

1490
05:27:29,090 --> 05:27:36,209
but i guess that you got the the pain so that was enough for a uh a painful hurt myself dab so

1491
05:27:36,209 --> 05:27:40,669
that's all right you didn't do the first one that's right the bottle did you no you didn't do the

1492
05:27:40,669 --> 05:27:51,619
bottles ring toss no you didn't do ring toss right oh shit you guys didn't do ring toss oh well

i think three times total in places that i you wouldn't think i've got recognized i've got

1538
05:34:24,849 --> 05:34:34,540

1544
05:35:11,500 --> 05:35:18,139
at a convention though something like twitchcon or pax or blizzcon it's happened maybe a dozen

1548
05:35:39,840 --> 05:35:45,040
two dollars and 50 cents 250 bits yo germa loved the carnival stream to me felt more like a love

1549
05:35:45,040 --> 05:35:50,000
letter to your audience rather than your magnum opus loving the streams more and more keep it up

1550
05:35:53,950 --> 05:35:58,880
i mean i tried to throw as many random little references in there as i could like the cash

1551
05:35:58,880 --> 05:36:05,790
machine and whale lord and pokemon stuff other little things too like clown car and

1552

stuff that i've been saying i wanted to do for a long time so yeah um it was a lot of fun

1553
05:36:16,099 --> 05:36:27,229
but see in a few months this is going to be a regular thing how much was the clown car

1554
05:36:28,029 --> 05:36:35,040
that clown car was very very inexpensive it just needed a little bit of spray paint

1555
05:36:36,270 --> 05:36:52,270
that's all it was not 400 but i don't want to give you any come on let the let the magic speak for

1556
05:36:52,270 --> 05:37:04,830

1633
05:49:22,689 --> 05:49:27,409
joke question i thought it was all right and i'll answer that i'll answer that for real now okay

1634
05:49:27,490 --> 05:49:33,919
when's the next hearthstone stream that's not a joke question i'm one of those sick

1635
05:49:33,919 --> 05:49:42,130
fucks who actually liked that stream and the new solo content came out well doesn't that kind of

1636
05:49:42,130 --> 05:49:59,040
answer the question i'm one of those sick fucks who liked that stream all right so i'm so gnarly

1637
05:49:59,040 --> 05:50:06,159
i may as well just stream it to you do they have passwords on twitch password controlled streams

1638
05:50:06,159 --> 05:50:14,779
i'll just give you the password and whatever at that point it's like 87 percent of every human

1639
05:50:14,779 --> 05:50:19,779
that sat here and watched that stream begged me not to do that ever again you're gonna give

1640
05:50:19,779 --> 05:50:34,689
him a private snapchat let him in no i can't please don't see that's only one person that

1641
05:50:34,689 --> 05:50:40,930
wants that a true one guy stream maybe i'll do it one day that's funny to me for some reason i

1642
05:50:40,930 --> 05:50:50,419
don't know why let's do a private stream to one person it should be a contest that would be a

1643
05:50:50,419 --> 05:50:56,880
really really funny contest set up some type of competition or contest or something and that

1644
05:50:56,880 --> 05:51:08,430
person wins a a private full live stream that would be so awkward yeah i mean it it kind of would

1645
05:51:10,459 --> 05:51:14,860
but that make it's making me laugh right now so i think it's something i want to explore

1646
05:51:16,770 --> 05:51:24,580
i don't think i could handle that what if they don't show up you know i all right i'm gonna

1647
05:51:24,580 --> 05:51:32,020
tell you this because there's no way it's gonna happen ever that's not true though i have to

1648
05:51:32,020 --> 05:51:43,090
hold on to so many ideas that i if i ever use them i can't let them out but when am i gonna

1649
05:51:43,090 --> 05:51:52,479
have time to do this though that's impossible i can't no i can't just in case years down the

1650
05:51:52,479 --> 05:52:02,740
road this is something that i do i can't you know i think there's one person that knows about this

1651
05:52:04,740 --> 05:52:15,549
maybe like two is lucratius here is luke here lucratius definitely not eu i think lucratius

1652
05:52:15,549 --> 05:52:26,590
is the only person that knows about this idea and they have been sworn to secrecy it's pretty

1653
05:52:26,590 --> 05:52:33,790
good though i'm not gonna lie it's pretty good it's something i've no it's nothing i've never

1654
05:52:33,790 --> 05:52:41,090
talked of uh so far no it's nothing that you've ever heard of before i've never talked about it

1655
05:52:42,689 --> 05:52:46,610
but we can move on we're uh we gotta end the stream here i didn't think i was gonna go for

1656
05:52:46,610 --> 05:52:49,970
seven hours but i haven't been i've been i haven't been around for like a week so

1657
05:52:51,470 --> 05:52:56,619
i'm cool to hang out and chill for a little bit so it's fine he just said you can tell us

1658
05:53:01,650 --> 05:53:10,180
no no it's not even it's not it's not gonna happen but there's no way to live again out of

1659
05:53:10,180 --> 05:53:24,900
me or lucratius what it is three hours of game four hours of chill yeah sometimes it's like that

1660
05:53:24,900 --> 05:53:36,669
though i'm okay with that sometimes but snoozing coffee thanks for the 250 hi germa the carnival

1661
05:53:36,669 --> 05:53:41,340
stream was exceptional i cannot wait to see what else you have in store for us in the future you're

1662
05:53:41,340 --> 05:53:48,540
the greatest thank you really and now to something else i'm on vacation in dallas and currently got

1663
05:53:48,540 --> 05:53:54,669
hit by a car on sunday that's not good i was on one of those electrical scooters in a car capped

1664
05:53:54,669 --> 05:54:04,049
me from behind well the mirror did holy shit i got away with a big bruise and some scrapes so i got

1665
05:54:04,049 --> 05:54:10,419
pretty surreal though you ever had any big accidents or injuries i've never been i never

1666
05:54:10,419 --> 05:54:19,310
been hit by a car like that before that sounds horrifying hopefully you're all right big bruise

1667
05:54:19,310 --> 05:54:29,490
and some scrapes thankfully but i've been i've had car accidents before i don't know if i've

1668
05:54:29,490 --> 05:54:34,750
ever told you this one time one time i got the worst car accident i was ever in in my whole life

1669
05:54:34,750 --> 05:54:45,119
was i was at a red light just sitting at a red light and somebody drove into the back of my car

1670
05:54:45,119 --> 05:54:53,500
going 40 or 50 miles per hour and and it was in it was horrible they just weren't paying attention

1671
05:54:53,500 --> 05:54:58,180
i was sitting at a stoplight for probably 10 seconds and this person i don't know what they

1672
05:54:58,180 --> 05:55:04,610
were doing i don't know what happened but holy shit they i thought my car exploded i'm just sitting

1673
05:55:04,610 --> 05:55:11,470
there at the light and then boom i thought i was like the car i was a car had to exploded it had

1674
05:55:11,470 --> 05:55:20,500
to have right how else would that have happened that was the scariest thing that was probably top

1675
05:55:20,500 --> 05:55:40,560
five scariest things in my entire life that was in my car was totaled that was it what's top what's

1676
05:55:40,560 --> 05:55:52,029
number one i i don't know i'm just saying that's up there somewhere i don't know what could possibly

1677
05:55:52,029 --> 05:56:01,680
be top above that um let me think what could possibly be above that i don't know that's why

1678
05:56:01,680 --> 05:56:12,639
i put i said it was somewhere in the top five it could be number one no this there's other

1679
05:56:14,130 --> 05:56:23,099
dangerous awful shit i'm trying to think like of my whole life i don't know i it's up there

1680
05:56:23,099 --> 05:56:26,459
somewhere i know i know there's other stuff that's happened that i could put up there

1681
05:56:32,959 --> 05:56:37,740
no no no there's more but now that's probably number one now that i'm really sitting here

1682
05:56:37,740 --> 05:56:46,220
thinking about it i just remember i don't i it's like when something like that happens to you

1683
05:56:48,580 --> 05:57:00,610
i can remember every second of that experience that's how crazy our brains are i can't tell

1684
05:57:00,610 --> 05:57:08,159
you what i had for dinner two days ago but i remember every second of that car accident

1685
05:57:15,500 --> 05:57:22,560
but man yeah i i don't want to go into like obviously grisly details but that was that

1686
05:57:22,560 --> 05:57:32,020
screwed me up for a little while it was really really fucked up but i was all right i was okay

1687
05:57:32,020 --> 05:57:39,409
the way that the car hit me the guy flipped over so he actually flipped over the right side of the

1688
05:57:39,409 --> 05:57:43,330
car and i think they were they were in like an suv so that's horrible because i was in like a

1689
05:57:43,330 --> 05:57:50,590
little tiny little i was like a chevy or something trying to remember what the car was yeah no it

1690
05:57:50,590 --> 05:57:59,330
was ridiculous and it was on one of the busiest roads too one of the busiest just actual roads

1691
05:57:59,330 --> 05:58:06,000
it was fucking crazy and i remember just getting out of the car and looking at this

1692
05:58:06,000 --> 05:58:12,240
what was left of my vehicle the whole back was crushed in and the whole right side passenger

1693
05:58:12,240 --> 05:58:19,009
was all messed up too and all i could think of over and over again was going thank god there was

1694
05:58:19,009 --> 05:58:24,610

1699
05:58:59,700 --> 05:59:12,799
relax like what are you doing see people going there's just whizzing by going like 50 in a 30

1700
05:59:12,799 --> 05:59:23,360
it's just like what are you what are you thinking vegas has some bad driving nah no they do people

1701
05:59:23,360 --> 05:59:36,819
gotta just relax a little bit you don't gotta you don't gotta go that fast that's why i don't

1702

drive anymore i walk i take public transport if i have to yeah i could i'm trust me i get it

1703
05:59:45,549 --> 05:59:54,959
he was gonna be he's gotta be more careful i don't know why some people just think they're

1704
05:59:54,959 --> 06:00:07,360
invincible in that thing you're not let me make that really clear you aren't that's kim say it's

1705
06:00:07,360 --> 06:00:14,290
worse than boston yeah we've been we've been on the highway before just driving and kim and i will

1706
06:00:14,290 --> 06:00:22,020
just be driving and all of a sudden you'll just see somebody just just going like and there are

1707
06:00:22,020 --> 06:00:25,860
other cars on the road too you've got like two three four five other cars in the lanes on the

1708
06:00:25,860 --> 06:00:30,500
highway and they just changing lanes back and forth back and forth left right right right left

1709
06:00:30,500 --> 06:00:38,110
right it's just dude what are you doing what are you thinking there's no reason to go that fast

1710
06:00:38,909 --> 06:00:45,090
look we're all going to baskin robbins they're still going to be open don't what are you doing

1711
06:00:49,759 --> 06:01:02,400
people just drive so fucking fast i don't understand it they close at eight on sunday

1712
06:01:08,020 --> 06:01:12,900
you say yeah and and the and the worst part about it then this is this is real talk right here

1713
06:01:13,860 --> 06:01:19,229
you know it really really irritates me in a car so if you're driving and you're on a road let's say

1714
06:01:19,229 --> 06:01:24,990
the road is 40 miles per hour okay and you know you're going 40 you're going you know i'm going

1715
06:01:24,990 --> 06:01:33,069
38 40 41 42 and 40 going 40 39 right okay all right okay settle down right cool

1716
06:01:35,360 --> 06:01:43,520
once you have somebody that passes you that's going like 60 in that 40 and then you go up to

1717
06:01:43,520 --> 06:01:51,169
the light that is less than a mile ahead of where you are and that person you look over to your left

1718
06:01:51,169 --> 06:02:02,700
and they're at the same light as you it's like you got real far didn't you think what you didn't

1719
06:02:02,700 --> 06:02:12,189
gain any time haven't you read the tortoise and the hare they wrote that fucking book like 75

1720
06:02:12,189 --> 06:02:18,669
years ago and it still rings true you're not gonna win a race it's we're just going to the

1721
06:02:18,669 --> 06:02:37,389
you're i you're not making time he's doing splits i that always just that just grinds me i get so

1722
06:02:37,389 --> 06:02:44,209
irritated i'm just like come on just think of like the danger that you're putting your fellow

1723
06:02:44,209 --> 06:02:50,110
drivers in and and even yourself for you to look over and see the guy that you passed at the red

1724
06:02:50,110 --> 06:02:56,049
light should be like an internal scenario where you go okay i'm kind of fucking up here i kind

1725
06:02:56,049 --> 06:03:13,299
of probably should think about what i'm doing people people are stupid yeah but i'm i'm just

1726
06:03:13,299 --> 06:03:25,220
venting at this point i'm just venting about drivers defensive driving is mandatory yeah it's

1727
06:03:25,220 --> 06:03:34,419
a temporary lack of empathy or consideration i i mean even i just don't want to get a car accident

1728
06:03:34,979 --> 06:03:42,139
i don't want to get in a car accident if i go 20 miles per hour over the speed limit i am

1729
06:03:42,139 --> 06:03:49,020
exponentially increasing the chances that i'm going to get into a car accident by tenfold why

1730
06:03:49,020 --> 06:04:02,799
do i want that should it be harder to get a driver's license i don't know if it should

1731
06:04:02,799 --> 06:04:11,549
be harder to get a driver's license or if we should i don't know what the answer is i think

1732
06:04:11,549 --> 06:04:18,799
people just like systematically need to get like taught fucking manners i don't know like that's

1733
06:04:18,799 --> 06:04:38,880
kind of what it is learn manners well because you don't cut the person off unless you you know

1734
06:04:38,880 --> 06:04:45,549
unless you just be kind of being a dick i can i can look if somebody if the speed limit is like

1735
06:04:45,549 --> 06:04:51,069
30 miles per hour and somebody's going like 20 like 25 it's like okay you're going slow here

1736
06:04:51,069 --> 06:04:57,540
you're going really slow if there's a passing lane then you're okay whatever but if somebody

1737
06:04:57,540 --> 06:05:05,790
like me i go the speed limit i do i go i go like within five miles per hour of the speed limit

1738
06:05:05,790 --> 06:05:12,979
whether that's okay it's a 30 i'm going like 30 like between like 28 and like 32

1739
06:05:12,979 --> 06:05:25,229
right i try to stay within about five miles per hour the speed limit plus or minus five yeah once

1740
06:05:25,229 --> 06:05:29,470
you start to get over about five miles per hour over the speed limit you really want to you don't

1741
06:05:29,470 --> 06:05:35,060
you want to slow down i'd say it like three or four miles per hour over is when i start to go okay i'm

1742
06:05:35,060 --> 06:05:50,529
going to pull it back a little miles per hour yeah which we are we are talking american in here

1743
06:05:50,529 --> 06:06:11,840
32 slow down there you're crazy 32 you know when it's a 35 i like to go my age 34

1744
06:06:11,840 --> 06:06:21,599
but there are smart ways to to drive the speed limit if you're gonna go more than 20 plus miles

1745
06:06:21,599 --> 06:06:25,919
per hour for the speed limit you are just putting everybody in danger and it's just not that's not

1746
06:06:26,000 --> 06:06:35,819
cool that's a real monka s like don't do that that's just fucking reckless and people do it

1747
06:06:35,819 --> 06:06:43,439
all the time but i consider and talk about how people driving around like assholes is annoying

1748

bits your accident sounds even more horrible than mine i don't know about that because

1801
06:14:15,009 --> 06:14:21,500
being in a car with the kind of that shell around you i don't know getting actually hit by a car

1802
06:14:22,060 --> 06:14:32,180
out of a car sounds insanely traumatizing so uh sounds like you got really lucky too i did

1803
06:14:32,180 --> 06:14:36,099
what i forgot to mention by the way is that the person that hit me didn't even stop or get out

1804
06:14:36,740 --> 06:14:40,979
maybe they stopped but i didn't see it because it was dark but i even had to cancel the trip

1805
06:14:40,979 --> 06:14:48,659
on the scooter and stand there wait for the app to authorize it wait what you do stand there and

1806
06:14:48,659 --> 06:15:00,459
wait for the app to authorize the trip on the scooter what and somebody just did did you end up

1807
06:15:01,389 --> 06:15:20,139
catching them did they find out who it was that's fucking horrible god what's wrong with people

1808
06:15:20,700 --> 06:15:40,580
but hopefully you did not get too badly hurt snoozing copter seriously and i would do the

1809
06:15:40,580 --> 06:15:44,340
necessary things to try to figure out what happened there because that's not that's not

1810
06:15:44,340 --> 06:15:57,360
all right they might be that might be a camera there somewhere that's possible to pull don't

1811
06:15:57,360 --> 06:16:10,770
let somebody fucking get away with that that's fucking horrible i'm all right i can walk etc

1812
06:16:10,770 --> 06:16:18,450
well that's um hopefully you don't have anything that comes out of that it sounds like it you're

1813
06:16:18,450 --> 06:16:34,029
you're gonna be all right hopefully you wish you a swift recovery but thank you mostly lost

1814
06:16:34,029 --> 06:16:37,950
thanks for the 250 somebody said the stream's been over for two hours sometimes it happens like this

1815
06:16:37,950 --> 06:16:44,139
usually this is about 30 to 40 minutes somewhere between 30 plus minutes or so but i've been gone

1816
06:16:44,139 --> 06:16:51,220
for a long time but thank you mostly lost for the 250 hey jeremy i was driving through dallas the

1817
06:16:51,220 --> 06:17:14,180
other night thanks for the 250 appreciate uh that thanks for the 250 thank you smelly boy for the

1818
06:17:14,180 --> 06:17:29,259
250 thoughts on people who ride their bikes in the car lane um it depends if there's a bike lane

1819
06:17:29,259 --> 06:17:38,159
they use the bike lane you got to be careful with cyclists though some cyclists are really really

1820
06:17:38,159 --> 06:17:44,619
really good and really smart sometimes sometimes that cyclist doesn't have reflective gear on

1821
06:17:44,619 --> 06:17:50,220
sometimes that cyclist is kind of just riding their bike on the road you've got to be careful

1822
06:17:51,020 --> 06:18:17,139
especially at night you share the road and if you're a cyclist you know you got to share the

1823
06:18:17,139 --> 06:18:22,580
road too we're all just we're all just trying to get to fucking baskin robbins all of us

1824
06:18:23,220 --> 06:18:35,409

1828
06:19:03,409 --> 06:19:09,819
