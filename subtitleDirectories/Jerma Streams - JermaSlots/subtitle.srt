1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:12,730
But anyways, we're going to move on from there. Oh, it's blue, sorry. I apologize for the blue.

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:22,620
We're going to transition here to the slot game coming up as Jerma Slots. This is the community

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:39,100
game. They changed the title. This was made by CAD, and I'll tell you, actually rage quit.

4
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:53,000
We got other things to do today. And by the way, this game is going to just be downloadable

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,820
on Steam for free. Just a free game. I did not have anything to officially do with this.

6
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:05,930
This is just something somebody made. And it was really, really interesting, really cool.

7
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,230
And I wanted to try it. This looks pretty elaborate. I've been told it takes about

8
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,980
an hour or two to complete the whole thing, depending on how lucky you are. And we're

9
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:34,810
going to find out. So I don't know what to expect, but I'm sure it'll be interesting.

10
00:01:34,810 --> 00:02:02,069
This is Jerma Slots. Just open it. Okay, here we go. There it is. Please read.

11
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:15,099
The slot machine in this game has several winning three of a kind combinations. Each

12
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:21,300
combination is a special event tied to it. If you want to see an event without naturally

13
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,139
spinning a winning combination, hit escape, go to the pause menu and check the enable

14
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:30,699
cheats box. A cheat drop down will become active under that box. Select the winning

15
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:36,539
combination from that menu and the next spin will give you that combination. Okay,

16
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:43,060
most events will occur only once restarting the game resets all events. Click on my face

17
00:02:43,060 --> 00:03:05,750
to begin. What do you got against David Bowie? Well, here's my, here's my old intro

18
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:21,750
from like 2011. That was quite the intro. Here it is. This is the menu. Here's the

19
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,819
options. Let's take a look. Resolution full screen, graphics full. Intro is on. Okay.

20
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:35,159
There it is. I have no idea what to expect. I'm looking forward to this.

21
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:45,430
This is not out yet. This will be able to be downloaded after this stream is over,

22
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,500
potentially even Monday because steam, I'm not sure you can, there's a release schedule

23
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,530
thing. It might be on Monday. So I got a free, I got a press copy of this game.

24
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,430
Just want to make sure everyone knows this has been, this key was provided to me.

25
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:23,689
I'm ready. Let's see how this works. So I can look around. This is, is it W A S D? Oh,

26
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:37,449
you dick. Press E to go. Oh, you just really, you're killing me here. Can I do anything else?

27
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:46,459
Can I interact with something? Can I jump? That's a cool, I'm going to, okay. Let's

28
00:04:46,459 --> 00:05:01,480
give myself a boost. Oh, let me look at the stickers. What are these ones? It's Jax,

29
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,209
Slug, Asteroid. Oh, this is emotes. That's awesome. All right. How much money do I get?

30
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:24,730
This is so cool. Press these keys to bet and spin. Press E to buy more bald coins. Okay.

31
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:38,439
So how many bald coins do I have? What did I just put in? I put in a $25 bill? All right,

32
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:47,769
here we go. So I'm going to do, let's spin. How many, we've got max bet this thing, right?

33
00:05:48,410 --> 00:06:04,329
There's nothing. So there's rat, glue man, my face, two rats. How much, how much down am I?

34
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:27,910
16 bald coins. I can't hit anything. Oh, you can, you can hold, wait, hold. Wait,

35
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:37,800
wait. I need the instructions. F1, F2, F3. E is interact. Okay. So F1, F2, F3.

36
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,459
If the player has enough money, they may hold up to two of the three wheels in order to

37
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,060
increase their odds for winning combination. A player can unhold held wheels by pressing

38
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,829
the same button again. The cost per wheel increases depending on the bet amount. Okay.

39
00:06:53,829 --> 00:07:06,100
Cost 10 bitcoins per wheel. That's like $50,000. That's not, that's not good enough for me.

40
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:18,259
I'm out of money. Free rats!

41
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:25,879
We're the rats. We're the rats. We pray at night. We stalk at night. We're the rats.

42
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,620
I'm the giant rat. Holy shit.

43
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,459
Let's see what kind of trouble we can get our sense into.

44
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,920
What is that worth? Five bucks? That was awesome. That was only five dollars.

45
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:51,209
I need to put, how do I, I need to put money in. No, I want, I'm gonna do it again. Spin.

46
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:12,300
Okay, hold the rats. Press E to, life is pain. I hate, there's bits on there by the way.

47
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:29,079
So that's, all right, that's 50 bucks. Max bet. Glue man, glue man. All right,

48
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:34,820
hold the glue man's, right? Hold the glue man's. Wait, I can't, I can only hold one of the glue

49
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:43,179
man's because my bet's too high. It's 10. God damn, I need more money. I can't hold, I need to,

50
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:53,639
I got a max bet. I'm sorry, I have to. I can't, no, I can't, lower the bet. What if I just,

51
00:08:53,639 --> 00:09:05,100
what if I do one instead? Okay, I can hold it with one. Glue man. Yes! Glue man wants to

52
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:19,299
fight. Fight, item, germa, run, item. Let's go with, let's go with fight. Elbow drop, Jex mode,

53
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:29,620
attack, wrestling, buff, legend, presto, majesto is a debuff, bake, save, attack, that's shriek.

54
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:41,960
Super effective. Glue man uses choke slam. This is awesome. Do you have any items?

55
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:48,789
Pure cholesterol, old pizza, fully heals me, heals germa for a moderate amount,

56
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:56,009
fully restores all of germa's abilities, cooking wine, ice coffee, fully restores one of germa's

57
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:01,850
abilities. I don't think, I don't need these yet. What does this mean? You have no germas left.

58
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:15,529
Okay, what about presto majesto? I missed it. God damn it. I'm gonna have to start eating

59
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:25,750
pizza. All right, what is Jex mode? Okay, let's try Jex. Germa uses Jex mode. Glue man uses hail

60
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:32,070
mary and he missed. So I got plus two here. All right, and now I want to do elbow drop. No,

61
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:44,580
no, back, back tap. All right, good. Germa can't move. Glue man uses showboat. All right,

62
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:51,350
we both hit plus two. Shit, he's gonna kill me. He crit! That's a critical hit?

63
00:10:52,309 --> 00:11:03,690
Ah, all right, I need to eat something. I still can't move? I gotta heal. Old pizza.

64
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,289
Germa digs an old pizza out of his bag and eats it.

65
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,809
All right, showboat is worn off. I think I'm all right still. Let's fight. What does

66
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:31,879
elbow drop presto majesto? Confused. Glue man is mesmerized. Good. Now we're gonna back

67
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:48,820
stab. Okay, mesmerized still, right? Yep. Glue man shakes off the magic and uses showboat.

68
00:11:48,820 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm gonna talk about, damn it, bonding agent. I need to heal. Elbow drop. I fucking missed.

69
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,700
Drinks wrestle sweat. Chokeslam has been restored. Uh oh, I need to eat pizza again.

70
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:31,879
Shit, this is kind of safe. It's level 99. All right, he's a higher level than me. That's not

71
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:48,940
fair. You have no germans. Oh, what about, what about ice coffee abilities? Pure cholesterol? No.

72
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,769
He's confused. Let's go again. Let's do, try elbow drop. I want to land this. It's not very

73
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:03,960
effective. So we gotta do, but he's still confused. We're gonna have to go with backs.

74
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:12,340
We're gonna have to backstab again. Nice. All right, keeping confused. Still mesmerized.

75
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:25,909
Perfect. Can I do it again? Do it again. Keep it in a constant state. Again. Shit.

76
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:33,830
I need to use an item. Uh, cooking wine. Fully restores one of my abilities.

77
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:44,820
All abilities are restored. He just healed. Shit. Uh, presto majesto again.

78
00:13:45,620 --> 00:14:00,059
No, god damn it. He's gonna kill me. Presto majesto, Jex mode, then backstab.

79
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:20,740
What happens if I die? Hit it. Critical hit. Look at that health drop. Do it again. He's still

80
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:31,820
confused. I can do it again. Crit again. Oh, he looks pretty close. Still mesmerized. Again.

81
00:14:32,539 --> 00:15:03,669
Hit it. Yes. Here we go. Crit. Uh, he's still confused. I need to heal. Uh, eat another,

82
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:13,289
eat another pizza. We're good. I might be able to end it right here. See, how many do I have?

83
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:33,509
I got two more presto. Uh oh. No! No! Shit. Oh no. I, at this point, if it's, uh, I,

84
00:15:34,070 --> 00:16:06,970
it's a race now. Oh my god, he keeps healing. This is never gonna end. No, not a full heal

85
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:22,840
yet. Not until I desperately need it. Stop eating pizza? No, back it up here. All right,

86
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:40,570
here we go. Give me a crit. Bring it down. Stay, yes, still confused. What do we got for items? Uh,

87
00:16:40,570 --> 00:17:09,019
I have to do bag of diced coffee again. Good. Give more off. Try it again. Yep. I'm gonna beat

88
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:33,339
it. One more of those. Stay confused. Yes! Again. Yes! He's so close. Yes! No! Don't heal.

89
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:56,440
Oh god damn it. What? Uh, oh my god. No. That sucks.

90
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:15,480
What happens if I lose? Do I die? I got greedy. What was I supposed to do? I had to try.

91
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:32,900
Don't worry, I'm gonna crit twice. There's one. Again. I'm fine. Everything's fine. He's still

92
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:39,319
confused. Okay, we're off. We have to try this again and then I have to use. How much more

93
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:52,500
cooking wine do I have? Good. I only have one more cooking wine. Wait, I'm gonna use the cooking

94
00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:21,779
wine. I still have my food. Here we go. Presto Magesto. Jex. Mesmerized. I need to get like

95
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:31,990
three or four crits here. Do it again. Stay there. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Again. That's

96
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:37,829
a big one. That's a big one. I only gotta do this one more time. Stay, he's still confused.

97
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:53,460
Okay, here we go. Presto Magesto has worn off. Should I do? That's it. I win. What? Wait, what?

98
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:07,910
He still has health? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no. No, no, no, no. He's gonna kill me.

99
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:24,740
Oh, this is bad. Please. Yes. All right, we should be safe here. End it. Stay there.

100
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:33,769
Okay, this is it. We're going all in. All in. Time to win. That's it. Glueman has fainted.

101
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:43,660
Jerma is victorious. You looted a hundred vault coins. That's a hundred bucks right there.

102
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:57,900
What a battle. That was awesome. Now what? Okay, should I? One credit or three credits?

103
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:11,579
I feel like we could make some money here. Three credits. Let's go. Three rats. What is

104
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:41,289
it to hold the rats? 20. Hold on. God damn it. Glueman, Glueman. I'm gonna lose it all.

105
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:59,559
Rat, rat, rat. That's a big hit. 15. Fuck, I spent more money trying to hold the rats.

106
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:09,609
No, don't hold them. It's more money. It's not worth it. Minus five bucks. There we go.

107
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:23,369
That's a hit. I gotta go down. I gotta drop my bet. I'll drop to two.

108
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:43,529
Shit. All right. That's okay. That's 10 bucks. Coward. I don't want to... I just got a big... I

109
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:55,619
just made a hundred vault coins. All right. Is there a pay table? Oh, look at that. There

110
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:01,990
it is. Okay. Here we go. Look. Vault coins are worth the most. A full Jupiter is worth

111
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:08,740
the second most. Yeah. All right. So the rat symbol is the reason why you've seen the

112
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,839
most of it is because the rat is the least special blend. So we're looking for

113
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:25,619
Jupiters and vault coins. Use the glue. Oh, look at this. Props. That's cool.

114
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,730
They said the rats were there. That's the glue. That's cool. There are the vault coins.

115
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:49,990
Termillionaire. Use the cheat screen. I'm not cheating yet. Vault coin, vault coin.

116
00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:06,230
Shit. What is Glueman worth? That'd be 60. It's worth it. Give it to me. God damn it.

117
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:30,180
Damn it. No. I'm going to have to put a little money in. Take it down to zero. Hey,

118
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:43,829
coming back. We're not broke yet. I can't do it. I can do it with tube. It's not worth it.

119
00:24:51,589 --> 00:25:15,130
Shit. Try a different machine. This one's rat infested. Life is pain. I hate...

120
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:32,019
$75 now. Well, technically $50 down. Here we go. All right. Let's bring it back.

121
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:53,180
Another one. All right. Again. Free beers. Okay. That's... Life is back in us. All right.

122
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,279
This is important. You ready for this shit? Hold them both. I need one more vault coin and

123
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:06,779
that's $2,500. And that's just, that's a win. That's a completion of the game. God damn it.

124
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:24,809
I got to drop the bet. Hold both these. Give me the beer. Come on. Damn it.

125
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:38,660
No. No. What? Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? Oh, I... Life is pain. I hate...

126
00:26:51,380 --> 00:27:10,380
Give it to me. Oh, it's right there. It's right there. Oh, yes. All right. We got it.

127
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:19,140
We've unlocked the mini game Beer Crossing. However, this works. I'm not sure.

128
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:27,480
Burgers collected. Injured beers. Level one. What?

129
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:47,660
I have to cross the street? Five burgers. All right. What do I need? Three more?

130
00:27:48,220 --> 00:28:02,809
How much time do I have? Can I go in here? Level one complete. Three burger value menus. $7.99.

131
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:21,160
Burg... I got five out of five. Let's go. Oh my God. Okay. That hurt. So that's one

132
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:29,079
injured beer. Does that take away from my money? Oh, you can see the corpses stay.

133
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:41,930
That's so funny. All right. Did I miss a burger? There's a burger down here. Wait,

134
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:46,680
I thought you said there was a burger down here. Oh, shit. There is. Okay. That's five.

135
00:28:46,680 --> 00:29:06,500
I got it. It's done. Only two. Oh my God. Okay. Get across. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go,

136
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:21,299
go, go. Is that Otto? Oh, that's awesome. Hello, Otto. Any more? I think that's it. $7.99.

137
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:30,539
I missed a burger. I don't know what that was. I missed one. Level three. This is so cool.

138
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:44,220
You stay on the yellow line. White line. Whatever. Why are the hamburgers on the road?

139
00:29:44,859 --> 00:30:09,589
I'm soup. There's probably eight. Seven. Oh, free the beers? Are they trapped?

140
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:17,559
They're not trapped, are they? I don't think they are. I think they're supposed to be.

141
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:32,099
Okay. All right. Slow down. They're not trapped. I can't save them. Free them.

142
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:44,980
There's no, I don't free them. They just stuck in here. All right. Hold on. Is there one more?

143
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:55,660
Here it is. Eight. Wait. You missed that one. Try another. That's so cool.

144
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:07,450
Look at all these references. 75%. I think that's it. Five injured beers. Eight out of eight

145
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,009
burgers even. Good. Next level. How many levels are there? Does this progressively just get

146
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:49,240
harder? There's one. Wait. No. All right. So this way. God. I'm panicking. Stop. Wait,

147
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,980
wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay. Okay. I need way more than this. Five, six, seven,

148
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:13,140
and eight. Is it nine over there? Quickly. Get across the road. Oh, fuck.

149
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,299
This is so awesome because there are just so many here waiting.

150
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:35,299
The lore. The live system in this game. It makes complete sense. Oh my goodness.

151
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:59,029
This is kind of hard. All right. I'm going to slow down. I suck. I can't do it. Hold on.

152
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:13,509
He's running into the cards. I promise I'm not. All right. Safe. There's only one more to get.

153
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:36,789
Oh, fuck. Your stomach can get hit by the way. Yeah. Your stomach is a hit box. It can get

154
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:50,390
makes perfect sense. All right. I'm going to run this way and. Oh, fuck. Is there any more?

155
00:33:50,950 --> 00:34:05,609
Oh, got it. Smile face. Hold on. Is there any more burgers over here?

156
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:19,480
There's Otto. Get out of the trash. Don't go in the trash. Bad dog. No more. Okay. I get 12.

157
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:37,739
12 out of 12. What the hell is this? This is a boss fight? What? Are you serious? Oh,

158
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:47,449
okay. I get it. I get it. Do I have to get burgers? I'm dead. Keep going or game sucks.

159
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:59,059
Okay. Obviously going to keep going. Shooting burgers. I got to watch out for the bullet

160
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:10,500
help. Oh my God. I got to go across the whole thing. How do I attack? Is there anything I

161
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:18,090
can do? I got to stay in the middle. What does that mean? Oh, they trap. No comes out.

162
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:40,980
Oh my goodness. This is cool. This is elaborate. All right. Watch out. I can find the right

163
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:56,010
spot to stay in. Spread them out. What's that? Tire? E. Oh, shit. I get it. Okay. This is

164
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:00,409
I have to throw tires at him probably three times like Dr. Robotnik style.

165
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:18,199
It's getting faster. Oh, God. All right. This is phase two. Just keep running in circles.

166
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,460
Oh, he has a, yeah. Mecha Burger Boy has a health bar. I got to hit him six times.

167
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,090
Oh, come on. Hurry, hurry. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick, quick.

168
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:42,090
I almost just missed. This is going to be impossible. I have to do that four more times.

169
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:58,059
Holy shit. Please play out. Oh, no. Oh, God.

170
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:25,880
Shit. Imagine this on like times five speed at the end. I was just gonna hit by that.

171
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:33,480
I completely forgotten it happened. All right. There's one. All right. Let's go.

172
00:37:34,199 --> 00:38:11,380
This is going to be the rest of the stream. I'm going to beat this. Here we go. Faster.

173
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:27,289
Faster, faster, faster, faster. I'm only 500 pounds. Feed me more. Watch the fire.

174
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:51,289
He changes it up. He's starting to, he's starting to juke around. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Come on.

175
00:38:54,789 --> 00:39:00,389
No, wait. I'm too slow. Oh, God damn it. I threw it the wrong.

176
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:13,699
I didn't know that was possible. Yes. Somebody got it. Yes. That was the

177
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:28,460
Big Bertha arcade game. All right. I'm gonna get it this time. You gotta be quick because he moves

178
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:44,679
fast. Tire. Get it? Can we stay? I think we stay at this speed. I don't think we go any faster than

179
00:39:44,679 --> 00:40:06,650
this. Oh, maybe it's only this for two phases. Oh, shit. That's faster. Oh, Jesus. All right.

180
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:22,360
Here it is. Give me. Oh, it's going faster.

181
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:37,079
Where? Anymore? Or in the middle? All right. I gotta stay right in the middle for this. I gotta

182
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:58,920
be, I just bullet hell dodge. Here we go. All right. Just dodge these. I got one more.

183
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:22,230
How many did you just shoot? Come here. Oh, got it. Oh, God. One more. That's it.

184
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:48,900
I only did one credit bet for this, by the way. Is that? Don't get hit. Don't get hit.

185
00:41:48,900 --> 00:42:02,980
Don't get hit. Don't get hit. No, don't leave. No, no, no. Leave me at crossing. No.

186
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:11,619
Fuck. No. God damn it. It was so close. I just got confused by the car coming down.

187
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:23,500
That was a choke. It's because when the car came down. Oh, shit.

188
00:42:27,400 --> 00:43:03,079
Damn it. I got it. It's harder than Jebel. No, just take the patience. God damn it. Just gotta

189
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:28,170
watch out for the... Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Mr. Mosquito. What does it say

190
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:51,719
behind the burger boy? Mine was just choke. There's this bird. All right. Here we go.

191
00:43:52,519 --> 00:44:37,849
I'll get it here. Just gotta be patient. All right. Bullet hell. Three more. This is it.

192
00:44:38,489 --> 00:45:24,949
This is the last speed. Oh, don't fuck it up already. All right. Come on. He's gonna move.

193
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:44,489
Here it comes. One move to the left. Oh, shit. Good spot to be in. Good RNG. Good RNG.

194
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:35,320
Yes. The meeting of the beers. The vault of burgers is ours. 26 injured beers. 31 out of 32.

195
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:51,860
That was fucking awesome. 10 bucks. 10 dollars. Because I was only doing one credit.

196
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,940
That would have been 30 bucks. Hey, it was the ride. The ride was worth it.

197
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:09,510
All right. So let's see. Cool. Surrounded by burgers for completing that one. So we've

198
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:15,960
seen rat burger boy glue man. There's still three we need to see. I've got more money to spend.

199
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:37,800
That was awesome. Nice. Always three credits. I wonder what the germ of fear face. I'm curious

200
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:46,539
what happens. I can't believe this game is just more than just a shit post. Oh, this is

201
00:47:46,539 --> 00:48:12,250
amazing. This is a lot of work went into this. For real. Damn it. How much money have I put

202
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:27,000
into the machine? I don't even know. It's a hundred dollars, right? Now you can see the stats.

203
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:34,329
Let's see. Music. Play intro. Events. Minigames. Enable. Enable cheats. Not yet.

204
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:47,980
Use stats. Steam achievements. Slot. Slot spins 84. Reels held. Bits spent 500 dollars.

205
00:48:50,090 --> 00:49:03,739
50,000. When did I spend bits? Minus 212 difference. Terma wins. Vault coin. Jackpot.

206
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:12,119
Event. Oh, this is cool. Perfect games. No perfect game. Fastest perfect game.

207
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,230
Jupiter. I don't want to see these. I don't want to see these.

208
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:42,360
Damn it. Oh, it's a hundred bits. It's a hundred dollars in bits. Oh,

210
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:24,780
What's this? Let's check out some fruit. Fruit. Not just a healthy snack, but also

211
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,099
very cheap and affordable. Go to your local grocery store and buy it by weight. You can

212
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:33,739
do it with apples. You can do it with bananas, or you can even juice some oranges with your son.

213
00:50:33,739 --> 00:51:21,420
Fruit. Crisp with a refreshing crunch. It's no wonder it's the doctor's favorite.

214
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:26,380
At just 95 calories, it's the guilt-free party fruit. Invite some friends over,

We got it. There's the jaw. The championship belt. My voice is two seconds behind. Yeah,

217
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:09,110

Let's see it. Oh, do it again. Yes. Solve the puzzle. All right. You did it.

222
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:14,730
That's it. Solve the puzzle. You have unlocked the advanced puzzle.

223
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:46,460
Oh, no. Oh, God. Are you kidding me? Five, 10, 15, 20. All right. Eight. I'm stuck here.

224
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:54,389
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three,

225
00:53:54,469 --> 00:54:24,409

227
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:42,460
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

228
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:54,010
nine. I can't. This is fucking fantastic. One, two, three, four, five. Five is in six.

229
00:54:54,010 --> 00:55:05,800
This is done. One, two, three, four, five. This is done and this is three, seven, four. One,

230
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:17,320
two, three, four. One, two, three. All right. One, two, three. One, one, one, one, one, one,

231
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:31,769
one, two, three, three. I can't believe that you actually made a pit cross level,

232
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:39,349
five, six, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, one, one, two, three,

233
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:53,460
two three two one one one this is correct we're talking about that's done okay so now we need this

234
00:55:53,460 --> 00:56:05,289
is motherfucker i swear to god one so seven how many here one two three four five six seven eight

235
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:16,309
nine ten eleven so one two three four okay so that's three let me just make sure i'm getting

236
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:24,539
this right one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven so this is the

237
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:39,829
first one is this three one two three three one two three three what emote is this going to be

238
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:47,130
that's the question okay that's that so it's 20 by 20 so that's three

239
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:54,570
nine one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen

240
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:01,769
so it can be four into the side right so one two five six seven eight nine okay

241
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:11,260
this is definitely the same thing in the middle here because they both nine one four

242
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:29,380
let me count here three six let me see what's down here this is eight seven one two three four

243
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:38,340
five six seven one two three four five six one two three four two three yeah this is correct

244
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:51,989
so this is three space this is three space it's five in the middle here five five six so one two

245
00:57:51,989 --> 00:58:03,980
three four five six seven and then this is a two this is three two all right that's part of

246
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:13,050
the six that's the one so that's five one three four one two three one so it's gonna be

247
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:26,969
right here that's one excellent commentary oh i'm trying to concentrate i can't screw this up

248
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:36,699
i'm trying so hard to like pay attention one two three four one two two four one three two four

one one two three four i think i can get this though let's see no look at me is there a big

250
00:58:57,699 --> 00:59:03,139
number here let's see five one three it can be somewhere over here this is part of the three

251
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:17,719
what about this way there's a nine in here a 20 by 20 of course you're gonna do that too

252
00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:27,769
four let's see seven ten thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen let's see here

253
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:35,260
two nine three hold on i can i can i do this whole thing three four five six seven yes i can

254
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:46,300
this column is done so that's four then three has to be in here one two three space one one

255
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:58,440
it has to be like right here that's the one and then here's your three in here somewhere

457
01:55:13,079 --> 01:55:27,109
so what all right cat i got a question what achievements am i missing there's two more

458
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:42,060
achievements that i don't have what are they you know is there is there a secret

459
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:52,710
well the perfect bia game okay like it turns better don't tell them it's i'll try to press

460
01:55:52,710 --> 01:56:16,180
the service button all right so start looking on the floor yeah all right that's fucking amazing

461
01:56:16,659 --> 01:56:34,840
okay where are those actually where are they about the author a snake in the clouds what else is in

462
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:44,569
there i can't see there's something underneath it is it a snake it's my children's book

463
01:56:52,380 --> 01:57:01,060
oh there it is it's my book okay so the other achievements are yeah i can't hit the

464
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:07,399
service button so the other achievements are to perfect the bia game and then to get 10 000

465
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:28,329
organically that was awesome i missed a giant jupiter where organically we don't have time

466
01:57:28,329 --> 01:57:35,800
for organically i don't think you need to do it organically uh not a perfect bia run just

467
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:56,229
all the burgers okay i see uh cad uh cad vip that is fucking oh this is great this is like a

468
01:57:56,229 --> 01:58:06,199
solid hour and a half two hours worth of like game content and you and i are gonna probably

469
01:58:06,279 --> 01:58:17,180
have a little discussion after the stream here because this is like this is next level uh-oh

470
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:26,329
he's in trouble was it the short joke you know you're not gonna have a little bit of

471
01:58:26,329 --> 01:58:36,789
convo about some of these things and i uh i well there's a bunch of people here to talk

472
01:58:36,789 --> 01:58:41,579
about it i was supposed to today if you didn't you missed what happened earlier i was going

473
01:58:41,579 --> 01:58:51,159
to do a scratch ticket for charity thing and this but um there's no state lottery in nevada

474
01:58:51,159 --> 01:58:56,279
it doesn't exist scratch tickets do not exist in nevada and it was a major massive oversight

475
01:58:56,279 --> 01:59:05,140
on my part for not assuming that there was no state lottery in nevada i had no idea i'm from

476
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:10,069
massachusetts originally i was under the impression i could walk into a gas station

477
01:59:10,069 --> 01:59:17,529
and just buy uh but so i know that is pretty ironic it is so what's going to happen here is

478
01:59:18,329 --> 01:59:24,329
there's a couple of scratch ticket things that i can do possibly but for the immediate future

479
01:59:24,329 --> 01:59:30,869
i'm just going to give two hundred and twenty one dollars to the nevada humane society so

480
01:59:30,869 --> 01:59:36,149
retroactively we're just going to say that each death in securo was a dollar so that's

481
01:59:36,149 --> 01:59:43,699
just going to happen and if i can somehow figure out a way to do that with actually

482
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:50,340
getting tickets i was a little disappointed today but mr mosquito was a lot of fun until

483
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:58,170
i broke the disc and then this was incredible so i'm very happy 221 not two dollars and 21

484
01:59:59,619 --> 02:00:04,199
yeah there's also like that i could do have somebody send them to me and then like i just

485
02:00:04,199 --> 02:00:12,409
cash them out in that state later there's a couple of ways but just for the immediate

486
02:00:12,409 --> 02:00:16,899
future to wrap up like the securo thing because that was to wrap up securo so i'm

487
02:00:16,899 --> 02:00:23,739
just going to donate the money so for the purposes of the rest of tonight i'm going to

488
02:00:23,739 --> 02:00:31,420
take a break uh and we'll come back and i'll just chill we'll probably just hang out might put in

489
02:00:31,979 --> 02:00:40,600
might put in uh there's a couple of options here i don't know if i want to do i'm not sure

490
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:43,850
if i want to do monster rancher 4 because i'm probably only going to stream for like

491
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:47,979
another hour so i think we're just going to come back and just chill and like i'll turn

492
02:00:47,979 --> 02:01:04,409
the camera around let's talk and hang out as it means i gotta go put clothes on more mr

493
02:01:04,409 --> 02:01:12,939
mosquito no i that was that became that gave me angry but we'll figure it out maybe

494
02:01:12,939 --> 02:01:17,539
we'll do something else i'll be back and we'll hang out for a little while longer before i turn

495
02:01:17,539 --> 02:01:24,949
