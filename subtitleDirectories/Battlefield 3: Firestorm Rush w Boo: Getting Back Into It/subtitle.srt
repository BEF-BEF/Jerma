Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Battlefield 3 gameplay commentary, and this is going to be a live gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:25,000
Just wanted to give you guys an introduction, because it's been quite a long time since my last Battlefield 3 video.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,370
Playing with BooMan61, who you'll be able to tell his voice the second he chimes in here in the live comp.

4
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,369
But I think he was flying the jet around, so he was having a grand old time.

5
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:42,119
I think we're playing on Firestorm, and the game mode is Rush, which I've become very, very accustomed to.

6
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,119
I love Rush. I love Conquest too, but they're both very, very good in their different ways.

7
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:53,420
But this brings me to the next thing I want to talk about. I want to try getting back into Battlefield.

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:02,420
Now, I don't know how much I'm going to upload it, I'm not sure what I'm going to do for videos, but maybe one or two a month I want to try and get into that kind of a flow where you get some content every month.

9
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,420
But I've got to get better at this game, and I've got guys like Boo, Shibby, I've played with Pwn before, as my mentors.

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,420
So I've learned a little bit, and I think I'm getting a little better.

11
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,420
But we shall see where I go from there, so definitely let me know, whether it's from a rating or from a comment.

12
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,420
Let me know what you want to see, if you like this, if you want to see more Battlefield.

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,420
I would love to know, because I love hearing from you guys.

14
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,599
So yeah, hopefully you enjoy the live commentary. It's going to kick in right now, and I'll see you guys all next time.

15
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,599
So take care, everybody.

16
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm making a run for it. Oh my God, maybe not. Come on, somebody show up.

17
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:34,099
Where are all these dudes? Oh, I see a guy right there. I wonder if I can hit this guy from this far away. Hit him. I didn't kill him.

18
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:42,780
All kinds of crazy scaffolding on Firestone, first base. That's what I mean, this first base gets a little tedious if they don't attack you very well.

19
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,539
I'm jabbing that tank. Oh, he smoked it. Shit. They planted. Where are they? Where are they at?

20
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:59,860
Yes, it's right underneath you. That guy dead? Yeah, I killed a couple of them. Nice, nice.

21
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:11,330
Stay alive, stay alive. Oh, disarm it. We've got to get it. I got it. Hell yeah.

22
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:18,629
Straight ahead. Tank, take that tank boy out. I got faith in you. You've done some damage. Was it you?

23
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:25,830
No, I didn't shoot one thing. There's a guy coming from the right. Yeah, there's a guy coming from the left side of the truck.

24
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,830
Unless he died? Yeah, he's died. Got straight away right here, straight to the right. Boink. I just boinked him.

25
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:41,689
Boink. That was the worst boink ever. Is there something going on over there? I probably shouldn't be standing up here.

26
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:48,939
I'm assuming this is not the best idea, but I'm going to do it anyways. I'm going to balance beam right now. I'm in the Olympics.

27
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:57,439
Should I spawn on you? I'm pushing pretty far forward. That's risky. I'll take that as an absolutely.

28
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:09,069
Okay then. I got us guys all. Yeah, I see the guy right around this corner. Two of them.

29
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:18,069
Got him. There's guys in the pipes running along. Guy down right there. Tank. Tank is dead and guy in the pipe is dead.

30
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:25,870
Nice, nice, nice, nice. I love this semi for you. Oh, beautiful. To the left. Lot of dudes. I'm turning. I'm running this way.

31
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:33,519
Holy shit, I just took a sniper shot. Can you throw some health though? Yeah. Oh, no man. I got it right here.

32
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:49,379
Thanks. Are they all coming from over here? Yeah. I see this one guy straight ahead. Oh my god. Oh my god. There's like an army coming right now.

33
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,379
This is why you'd like to have a sniper rifle. And there's a helicopter or something coming out of the way.

34
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:03,259
Oh yeah. If I had a sniper rifle right here. See right now this guy probably has one. Yeah, that guy probably has one.

35
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:15,170
Question is, did we make the wraparound? Can we do it, you think? Oh, what was that? That was my javelin. Probably a bit of overkill.

36
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:23,540
I just used it to kill this tiny little robot thing that takes three bullets to die, but it's so pesky to hit. Oh my. Wow.

37
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:35,860
I just got like. Oh, it was the tank. It was the tank, I see. Tank, be honest. I don't even know where he is. Get out of my face.

38
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,459
I just held out. That guy just saved my life. Run, run, run, run, run. I need help.

39
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:57,870
Alright, I'm going to plant right here for a second or two. Looking for some. Is he on the. Where is that guy? Is he up here? What the hell? Where is this guy?

40
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:09,000
He must be right here. Is he up top? I am so confused. Yeah, he's right here. What's that? That's F. F is knife.

41
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,459
I'm just sitting. What the hell? Okay, I killed him with a knife, but it was like face stabbing somebody like the spy.

42
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:24,459
Like just like I'm the chaos stabbing someone. Yeah, they're the funniest ones. You just like put your hand on their chest.

43
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,939
I didn't even do the animation. I was just like one, two, three. Oh, right. You just like slashed him? Oh, God.

44
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:40,180
I just slashed that guy to death. Oh dear. Oh God, they planted both the charges. Holy shit.

45
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:50,730
Yeah, there's a tank. I'm dead for sure. For sure. There's a tank right here. Oh my God. Maybe he won't see us.

46
00:06:50,730 --> 00:07:01,649
Well, maybe. Whatever. Did they plant it, you said? Yeah, we defused. Got my first ever magnum.
