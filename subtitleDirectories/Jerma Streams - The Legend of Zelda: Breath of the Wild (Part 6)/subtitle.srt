1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,289
So now I'm going to... I'm still alright. Let's um... I don't know, am I, is my brain capable of even

2
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:19,190
playing Breath of the Wild? What is on Switch right now that I can just get? That's just simple.

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,969
I feel like it's become very evident on this stream that I am not completely screwed in.

4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,809
I feel like I'm playing in somebody else's body, you know what I mean? Like I feel like I'm controlling

5
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:46,409
me, like looking down as a spirit. What's like simple? Play Animal Crossing? There's a new

6
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:57,450
Monster Rancher. Wait, there is, isn't there? Hold on, I need to investigate this. Let me investigate

7
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:13,640
this. Is there really? Let's take a look. What's the first thing that pops up on the uh like the

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:23,379
featured page, I wonder? It's only on Switch. I'm afraid to play a Monster Rancher game because I

9
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:28,340
said that I was gonna get guaranteed, no matter what, a monster to S-rank in Monster Rancher 1

10
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:41,019
or 2 and I just didn't do it. I got to like A and just quit. What have we got? It's gotta be something

11
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:49,859
that's just like just completely just basic that I could just do. Oh, Vinny Raid, what's up? Welcome

12
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:56,299
everybody. Thanks Vinny. Thanks for playing. Uh, maybe we didn't have the best Splatoon gameplay,

13
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:02,060
but we hung on. We had a good time. That's what matters. Uh, welcome. All right, so what can I

14
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,909
just do? Maybe I will just open up Breath of the Wild and just kind of do a shrine or something.

15
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:29,979
Yeah, let's just do that. That's easy. Let's just do that. Do the SNES online thing. Eh,

16
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:46,460
it's this one, right? Oh, I don't have to do this anymore. I can actually, I can really hear the game.

17
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,939
You can explore. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Thanks for hanging out everybody, seriously.

18
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:01,620
I know that I'm kind of a little fucked up. I have COVID if you don't know. I'm gonna just say

19
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:13,939
that because that is what's going on. We have to be nice. He's sick. No, I actually am fine. I just

20
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:19,340
feel a little weird. All right, the last thing that I did. All right, we need to change the title of

21
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:27,509
this stream so it's not like I'm shitting my pants or something. How about, I don't know. All right,

22
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,900
mods, you have complete creative control as long as there's no swear words. You don't talk about

23
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,740
like how, what I, how I look like, what my face looks like today, which by the way, I'm surprised

24
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,060
nobody has said anything about like the way that my, I guess maybe it's not coming up that well,

25
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,379
but maybe I have to be bigger on the cam. No one's said anything about this today,

26
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:59,689
which is fucking shocking. Do you see like my facial hair? I think people might have just been

27
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:17,079
being nice. I literally shaved this part and left everything else. I thought it was hilarious,

28
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,699
by the way. I was talking to Holly and I thought it was the funniest thing ever. I was like, oh my

29
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:31,819
God, like I'm going to shave like this part. The real reason why it's not just for like a stupid

30
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:37,060
comedic purpose is because I haven't, I've been, I've felt sick obviously. So I haven't really

31
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:44,500
shaved in four or five days. So it got really, really itchy and annoying. And it's, I don't know,

32
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,420
I hate having itchy, annoying hair up here under my nose and above my lip. So I just got rid of it.

33
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,019
And that's the actual reason. And then I just like, I kind of didn't care how to do the rest.

34
00:04:54,019 --> 00:05:00,740
I was tired. All right. Let's, what are we doing? I just upgraded my tablet. Let's go.

35
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,509
I have access to, I don't think I want to do the big shrine right now. I don't know how much more

36
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:17,019
gas I have. Rank two is over here. Let's go ahead and deny that one. Okay. Oh, actually,

37
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:29,339
that's a good idea. I need to turn that off. I had to turn it on. Hold on. How do I do this?

38
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:37,610
Oh, here it is. Okay. What do you mean, deface? I mean, that was a little mean. Again, that was

39
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:47,829
a little mean. But I, what do you want me to say? All right. I'm not going to turn this off. Okay.

40
00:05:47,829 --> 00:06:05,899
There we go. Why are you defacing me? Yeah. There's this, which is the area with the big divine beast,

41
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,829
right? Not ready for that one. What I am ready for is I think maybe a little bit of exploration

42
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:19,160
to the left here. Does that make sense? I'm going to go to the left here. I want to check it out.

43
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:38,839
You want it to be your friend. I don't, but I, when are you going to do a full playthrough?

44
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,850
Rest of the Wild is a fun game just to, just play it every now and again for a few hours.

45
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:50,740
It's a great game just to be like, all right, what else am I doing today? This, I'll do this.

46
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:59,560
All right. So I'm looking for shrines because I'm a shrine Andy. So I need to go, I'm going to go

47
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:14,060
over here and what's that shrine just ahead? There's one there. It's the only one I can see.

48
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:20,040
All right. We're going to go straight ahead here. I should probably mark it.

49
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:29,290
Oh wait. I can use the zoom in thing. There we go. How do you zoom in? Oops.

50
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:43,420
I saved it. It's over here somewhere. This is interesting. What's going on here?

51
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:54,939
That was with a pixel to spare, to not die. Yeah. Again, I wanted to be live today too,

52
00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:00,699
so I could warn everybody that tomorrow is the sus guy stream where the entire channel is going

53
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:09,480
to be rebranded. You are not going to even recognize this place tomorrow. So the sus

54
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:17,610
guy is finally going to play among us and I'm fucking leaning into it as hard as I can.

55
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:24,100
All right. So I upgraded the stasis, didn't I? So what does this, what's the upgraded stasis do?

56
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:37,000
What does it let me do now? Probably something, right? Put this on. This thing's damaged already.

57
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:50,419
I didn't even fucking do anything. It can freeze enemies now. Let's try it. Ooh. So this will do

58
00:08:50,419 --> 00:09:04,919
all the damage. All right. That's pretty huge. That's awesome. I've never actually done that

59
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:17,019
before. All right. Trying. I'm going to have to get rid of this weapon. It's going to be damaged.

60
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:27,909
Where was it? It's like this way, right? Am I going the right way? What time is the sus guy stream?

61
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:41,480
Now that is a good question. Is it right here? I already did that one. To the left? Why do I

62
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:52,019
have to fall off? What time? I don't know. Just, just look for it. You're not going to be able to

63
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:58,139
miss it. I'm telling you. But it's going to be, it's going to be like a hundred billion people

64
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:07,019
watching that stream. You understand? You're not, you'll be able to find it. Now this is so funny

65
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:13,100
to me because if that stream is like wicked shit viewership, it's going to be even funnier.

66
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:23,690
So I'm prepared either way for this to be a win no matter what. Because that's funny. Like if like

67
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,929
nobody shows up to that stream tomorrow and I do all this rebranding and I do this big, oh, I'm

68
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:42,460
like selling out for the sus guy joke. That's funny. I just got a fairy? What? That's a revive?

69
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:59,429
Okay. I need to go this way. Is the horse anywhere near me? No. You can eat. No, you can't. Can you?

70
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:17,320
You can get more. That's pretty cool. I didn't even know they existed. The shrine is between the

71
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:25,080
tower and the distance here. Is it this far away? If I could have glided and not fallen down.

72
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:46,090
I have the shrine thing set to on, right? Cut the grass. They, wait, they're in the grass. That's

73
00:11:46,090 --> 00:12:05,559
cool. Oh, watch out. Ganon. There it is. Ooh, that was, this one's weird. It's like a dragon head.

74
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:27,399
Do you guys see? Oh, wait, this is the, oh, okay. So, I get the horse back here. Let me take an

75
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:38,570
inventory here. I have a lot of shit. Maybe do some cooking. Eh, I got plenty of apples.

76
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,320
Greetings, traveler. How about a song? That, there are, I thought he was singing.

77
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:58,059
I'm sorry. It's nothing. I don't mean to pry. Pry about what? Are you, have you never met a

78
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:04,070
rito before? Odd. My name is Kas. As a bard, I spend my days traveling this land in search

79
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:11,159
of ancient songs. Have you heard of the ancient songs? No. Ancient songs, songs that sing the

80
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:17,590
praises of a hero who beat back the calamity in an age past. One of the more famous among them

81
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,870
recounts the events of 10,000 years ago. I happen to know a song about the ancient hero is passed

82
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:41,899
down to me. Do you want to hear it? Yes. Please do. How is it? Here we go. Should I sing this part?

83
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:54,809
A dog. I don't feel well enough to do this. Hope survives in Hyrule. I don't care. I,

84
00:13:54,809 --> 00:14:02,549
he's supposed to be singing, not me. It's supposed to be his song. Just read it.

85
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,379
Somebody said, dude, you have an iron deficiency. No, I have COVID right now.

86
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:29,450
I don't have an iron deficiency. He's lazy. No, I'm not. I have, my iron's fine. Kingdom of Hyrule

87
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:43,100
was once, I don't know the beat. I can't even hear the music. Ganon lurked beneath the surface,

88
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,590
strengthening its jaws. So the ancient people of Hyrule said to help cause. This is not even a song.

89
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:55,990
Their efforts bore fruit in an automated force to help avert calamity by sealing it at its

90
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:05,179
source. For giant behemoths for which the power never ceased. Each of these titans was called

91
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:10,870
a divine beast. It's not a Disney movie.

92
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:34,149
Well, how do you know that? There's no lyrics here. You sound like Steve from American Dad.

93
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:47,129
That voice actor is an incredibly talented singer, by the way, if you didn't know.

94
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:53,500
And when I'm, I don't know. I took too much fucking cold medicine for this one.

95
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:13,419
So this is the original game for the regular Nintendo. Wait, that wasn't 10 years ago. This is

96
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:38,970
what? Twilight Princess? No, you're a fake fan. I don't play Zelda games. Yeah, that's correct.

97
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:50,440
I think I heard this music and it just made me think, oh, that's old Zelda stuff. Thanks for

98
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,100
listening. Please come back and hear it again sometime. Hold on. I got to replace this. Give me

99
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:02,139
one sec. It is the original game. Yes. Well, I think you, I think you're one of the only people

100
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:10,259
that said that, but I appreciate it though. Hold on. Let me plug this in. I'm plugging in different

101
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:21,849
headphones. It's not a song. It's more like an old proverb. All right. But if he said he was going to

102
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:48,009
sing, he has an accordion. Ouch. Ow. You ever put too much weight down on your elbow? Weird, like

103
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:53,049
weirdly enough, you put, you put your elbow down to brace yourself or something and you put a little

104
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:59,849
just somehow too much weight and it's just, just this insane pain. Just whoa. But other times you

105
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:09,130
put the exact same spot, it won't hurt at all. Okay. Well, that's cool. Pretty cool lore. Trying

106
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:15,400
time. I'll show you how it's done. I missed every single swing and I didn't do that on purpose.

107
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:42,539
Is this a combat shrine or a puzzle shrine? Let's find out. Time for a chat mute. Yeah,

108
00:18:42,539 --> 00:19:04,309
go ahead and do it. All right. It is shields from water. Okay. Shields from water. I'm going to

109
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:13,529
assume this is, we're going to have to do this. Freezing here. Do I die in this water? No. Okay.

110
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:30,309
I got to stop the flow of water. Actually, this is, this is a current here. I don't even know how

111
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:37,849
you even do that. Like, oh, you know what? It's all right. Sprint being X and jump being B.

112
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:56,970
Kind of weird. All right. Does this do anything? Walk with water. Wait a minute. I can't. Ah,

113
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:36,150
look at that. Didn't take me any time at all. Really? Is this not high enough? Oh, okay. Watch

114
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:56,660
out. Laser. Okay. Let's try this. No, not stop time. I can pull it out, right? Ah, all right.

115
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:04,220
So, the chest chest over there. Oh, I know. I already got it. You don't even need to help me.

116
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:17,779
If I need help, you know how I'm going to ask for it. You better believe it. What's in here?

117
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:35,690
Ancient core. Pretty good. Sorry, I already got it. This one doesn't seem very hard. This one seems

118
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:46,420
just pretty good. You know what I mean? Ancient screw. I just got that for free. All right. Hold

119
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:54,579
on. Let me, I need, I don't want to use these arrows. Where did I get 41 ice arrows? Are you

120
00:21:54,579 --> 00:22:23,210
serious? Okay. Well, I'm going to use it and let's just use the knight's bow. Okay. Should I play the

121
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:34,900
Sims 4? Like just get all the expansions and just play it? What the fuck? Get up. Stop. How do I get

122
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:47,900
on? I thought I was going to miss it. Whatever. That's fine. Like I dragged over. At least I

123
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,079
could see what I need to do. I'm going to have to block it, right? Whoa. That was cool. Okay.

124
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:35,509
I definitely have to block it from going over. How do I get that one? No. Wait, I know what to do,

125
00:23:35,509 --> 00:24:01,480
right? Yeah. Knight's broadsword. I'm going to run into one of the wood ones. Okay. So what happens

126
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:27,960
over here? No, no, no, no, no, no. Get it. Grab it. Grab it. Grab it. I'm dead. The current is going

127
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:37,900
to pull you. All right. So I just have to get to the raft. Now this is where I'm going to have a

128
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:50,680
little bit of trouble, I think. So I have to get rid of all this. Can I move this with the... No,

129
00:24:50,680 --> 00:25:08,500
this is made of wood. All right. I turned it into a fucking McRib. It's fine. Oh my God. Wait,

130
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:20,059
wait, wait. Don't. That's okay. I'm dead. I have to get on top of this. That just spawned and I

131
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:38,069
wasn't even ready. Is another one going to come? So I have to block it right at the end here.

132
00:25:38,549 --> 00:26:29,609
Oh shit. Easy. Got it. Spirit orb. Why are you on? What are your pajamas on? This is a Marvel shirt.

133
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:39,369
This is not. I have four now. I can do another upgrade. Explain the McRib joke. It looked like

134
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:56,019
a McRib when it was upside down. This is not what I explained it. How? You're a nerd. Go back and

135
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:03,900
look. It looked like a McRib sandwich. All right. I got four orbs. Let me get the horse back.

136
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:13,670
And from here. All right. I got a... Oh, it's a bridge right here. All right. I'm going to

137
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:23,900
go to the bridge and go left. That's the plan. I like exploring. Is this on Switch or PC?

138
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:40,809
Rank two. This is it on Switch. You can't get in for anything else.

139
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:55,380
All right. Rank two. How am I doing on it? I think I'm doing okay on food, right?

140
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:06,680
I've got a lot of food that I never ate. I spent like 45 minutes cooking all this stuff before

141
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:12,779
and then like turn the stream off. Wait, I have those truffles. I don't think I need them yet.

142
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:38,900
Let's keep exploring. Buy arrows. Oh, thank you. Where is... Where's the guy with the big

143
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:57,940
sack on his back? He's inside. Okay. Look at this dog. Cool. All right. I want to buy.

144
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:06,259
Yeah, but should I play The Sims 4? You know what? After VR, after like the two or three days in VR,

145
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:16,599
we're just doing a fucking brand new Sims 4 insanity day. Oh, I need to give me all these.

146
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:27,849
This is so cheap. Wait a minute. Am I getting scammed? Buy them in bulk, right? 6, 12, 18, 20...

147
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:37,289
6, 12, 18, 24, 32. You save a little bit of money, but I'm going to buy 20 of these.

148
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:55,019
What is this? Oh, hot-footed frog. Max stamina. Should I just get buy everything? These are only

149
00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:15,450
10 cents. These are cheap. I'll take them. Are these worth it? I mean, if I got money, I'll take them.

150
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:27,609
I'll take them all. No. Okay. It's... No, no, no, no. They're easy to go catch. Okay. Go catch them.

151
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:44,180
They're free. Oh, I thought it was the dog for a second. I was like, wait. I know. No, I don't want

152
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,059
to hear that song again. It was a good song, but I don't... We don't need to hear it again.

153
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:58,970
All right. Let's go. I'm for exploring. What was the thing that people said that it just...

154
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:17,160
The horse automatically goes on the road if I press something? What is it? All right. How do

155
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:29,700
we save this person? You press Z, L, L. Okay. Are you okay? Look who's here. The guy that stood around

156
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:47,829
and watched me get beat up. A little help next time. Okay. That's what I just did, isn't it?

157
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:53,289
All right. Let's put that... No, I'll keep this one on. So if I get closer to the Calamity Ganon

158
00:31:53,289 --> 00:32:15,670
castle, is it some bagging happen? Just don't press anything. Okay. What does that mean?

159
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:47,619
What is... I don't... I'm not going to the castle. Let's go over to that tower this way. All right.

160
00:32:50,539 --> 00:33:06,039
There's a lot of towers over here. Should I fight this thing? Oh my God. There's like

161
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:22,390
more than one. Can't do it when I'm on a horse, can you? Oh shit. Multiple people

162
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:53,700
shooting sniper rifles at me. Is he okay? What happened? Oh my God. Why is this like

163
00:33:54,579 --> 00:34:04,660
level 100 zone? What is going on? Why am I still alive? What's happening? Excuse me?

164
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:35,579
Help. Help. Why am I stuck? Get up. Yeah. Fuck you. Climb a tree. Climb a tree. Climb a tree.

165
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,420
Climb a tree. Climb a tree. Quick. Just like a fucking animal.

166
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:54,489
It's raining, you stupid game. What if they... Can they shoot each other?

167
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:18,219
I just have to get over there, dude. Come on. What keeps refilling my health? I just... Oh,

168
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:21,900
that was fairies. Oh, I didn't know I can't go over there. There's like a... All right. I didn't know

169
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:29,320
what was going on over there. So I didn't know I was going to go into like the part of the game

170
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,679
where I'm not allowed to be. And I'm going to get warnings on my screen. Like, you're leaving the

171
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:45,480
game area. Warning. You're leaving the game area. Okay. Well, we... I can't... I'm not going this way

172
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,340
again. I'm going somewhere else. Where should I go? It's not possible? All right. Well, then I'm

173
00:35:51,340 --> 00:36:11,159
going to go... I'm going somewhere else. Go south, then west. Like down here? You need to learn how

174
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:31,110
to parry. You're just too low level right now. I'll go this way. You guys also have to remember

175
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:41,849
that I haven't played this game in like two or three weeks. I don't know where I'm supposed to

176
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:49,820
be going. All right. I'm going to say if this is like too high and too hard. Did you say rip?

177
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:56,659
I'm going to go this way. Let's just bang a left. It's cold here, but that's all right. I have cold

178
00:36:56,659 --> 00:37:12,659
gear, don't I? No, that's swim speed. I don't have any cold gear. I have fire gear. What about the

179
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:29,530
divine beast? I feel like I was right about to do it. The one in the mountain. Yeah, I'm going to

180
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:37,719
go there. I feel like I was about to start doing that. Yeah, I'll do that instead. That was up here,

181
00:37:37,719 --> 00:38:05,619
right? I remember there was a mine cart. How come I need to get a tower here? It's just a green tea.

182
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:19,349
Get the tower first. Yeah, I'm going to just find the tower first. All right. I just wanted to get

183
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:25,619
over here and see. This is definitely not the right place to be. Oh, my shit's burning.

184
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:38,710
You know what? I don't fucking want it anyways. Okay, so that is a tower that way, which I think

185
00:38:38,710 --> 00:39:01,639
this is closer to the tower. Why did you throw the good sword? It was about to break. That sword

186
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:07,690
actually was about to break. This is where the mine cart is. All right, hold on. Let me try to

187
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:24,949
remember something from a month ago. I'm going to go high, right, and look over here because I can

188
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:47,179
actually see what the fuck I'm looking at. You use first person? I will. All right, let's take a good

189
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:58,780
look. So I need to look over here. There is the tower right there. Stamp it. That's not A.

190
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:15,929
God damn it. Is there anything else here, too? No, that's definitely where I want to be.

191
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:21,849
All right, can I just float over there? We're going for it. You got that shirt at Walmart.

192
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:27,030
You don't need to concern yourself where I get my t-shirts, okay? You don't need to concern yourself

193
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:34,309
where I get my t-shirts. It doesn't matter. Did I get it from Target, Walmart? Did I get it from...

194
00:40:34,309 --> 00:41:52,980
Am I dying? Why am I dying? I'm getting hurt. It's not that much. Well, I can just climb. It's not

195
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,360
raining. I can get up here. Oh my god. Why is it raining? It's not even raining on the weather

196
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:25,500
forecast. It just rained in one spot for one second. All right, we're good. Come on, come on,

197
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:51,219
come on, come on. Please, please, please. People are gonna make fun of me. Oh, nice. Good. Okay,

198
00:42:51,219 --> 00:43:19,780
this will do it. Yeah, there it is. I'm good. Broad sword. Let's get it. This is pretty. Thank

199
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:29,340
God Frank too is okay. Yeah, he took a explosive sniper rifle bullet right to his side. A shield?

200
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:59,960
What is this? Do I have to match that thing? I have to match this. Okay, so it's... Put this

201
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:11,480
down. Let me go look at this. It's like a Tetris piece. So it's one on the top. So it's one, two,

202
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,630
three, four. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, one.

203
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:29,690
I forgot. One, two, three. One, two, three, four. One, two, three. One, two, three, two. One, two,

204
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:48,019
three, four. This is not right. I have to do this. Okay, I had it in reverse. It's like this.

205
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:02,570
Everybody talks shit about me when I couldn't do this the last time and it's probably a different

206
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:16,500
puzzle. I probably don't have to match these. Or do I? One piece just sticks out in the back.

207
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:34,550
Just put it in. It wouldn't fit in. I mean like right here. I don't think I can do that. I can't

208
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:42,809
believe this because everybody fucking said last time too. Am I supposed to be matching it? Is that

209
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:49,860
what I'm actually supposed to be doing? There's two sticking out on this side, one on this side,

210
00:45:49,860 --> 00:46:08,599
one on this side, and then three on the back. So it's got to go over here. I don't know if... I

211
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:32,579
thought people may have been fucking with me. How did that take 24 minutes? It took like three.

212
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:50,219
And that person for an hour. Oh, it's in my eye. Oh, this is like steamy. Okay,

213
00:46:51,099 --> 00:47:01,159
should I just go up the front door here where the path is? This seems like the right idea.

214
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:30,739
Are the chocobos hostile or no? They don't look it. God damn it. Overshot it.

215
00:47:40,500 --> 00:48:07,769
Fucking piece of shit. You thought you were gonna get me with that? Nope. Sorry. I'm gonna watch my

216
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:27,769
health. Who is doing that by the way? The chest. Oh my god, there's a chest here. What is going?

217
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:33,699
Why did I climb up a fucking mountain? I'm so angry. Hold on. I tried to turn around.

218
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:47,349
Nice. I need to eat something before I die. Just something tasty. Something that's not

219
00:48:47,349 --> 00:49:03,880
gonna do anything crazy, right? How about this? How about just a few apples? I don't

220
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:21,639
need... Whatever. I don't want to waste food. Are you guarding something? All right, let's move.

221
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:28,659
You motherfucker.

222
00:49:42,809 --> 00:50:02,980
Trying, really? What's this? Oh, goodness. I'm eating something better than that. Yeah,

223
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:22,260
let's just go with a fried wild greens. Let's go. Give me more health. Don't go chasing. He's dead.

224
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:59,210
What are you guys guarding over here? What's this? I'm gonna blow this shit up. I'll take them.

225
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:35,539
That's good. What is that? Crab? Is there anything even in that? Roasted bass. This is food,

226
00:51:35,539 --> 00:52:00,940
so this is good. Okay, more food. I'll take it. Pick up the boxes and drop them to break them.

227
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:16,570
I'll remember that for next time. Very cool. All right, almost there. It's right up here,

228
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:42,969
right? Is this a shrine? That's my favorite. What was that? Are they on fire? Okay.

229
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:56,820
Still have COVID? Yes, I do. I do. It's pretty mild, but still sucks. It's sort of right in the

230
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:13,030
middle of it right now. Did I get this one? No. Let me go up a little higher. Yeah, I have my

231
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:19,420
sense of taste, my sense of smell. It's all there. I'm just really raspy and congested,

232
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:28,420
and it kind of just feels like I like get my face punched. I just feel like kind of sloppy.

233
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:58,789
Okay, can I jump? I think I can jump over this, right? Can I not? Elden Tower. I think I can make

234
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:15,289
it. Just got COVID myself. Definitely not a fun experience. I just hope it goes away soon. They

235
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:23,300
know that COVID has a tendency to linger, which not looking forward to that if that's the case.

236
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:28,500
I am fortunate enough where I have a very mild case of it so far. I obviously don't want to,

237
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:43,239
you know, knock on wood, but it's pretty mild. Cool. All right. Let's actually see what we're

238
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:54,039
doing here. Don't push yourself. No, I'm good. I wouldn't be live right now if I

239
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:59,449
didn't think I could be for at least a few hours or so. I mean, I might be a little sloppy today,

240
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:19,429
but is that any, let's be honest, is that really any different? Your voice sounds better than

241
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:30,119
last stream? Probably. Although I have been taking this high little cold kind of whatever,

242
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:49,530
maximum cold strength. Cool. Okay. Well, now I can actually see what I'm doing. So important.

243
00:55:51,420 --> 00:56:00,230
This is, where's the, the beast is up here. Let me go to, actually, let me go here.

244
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:08,469
Destroy Ganon, the hero sword, free divine beast. Okay. This is the one.

245
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:14,070
Ludo, thank you for helping Unobo after taking the painkillers. Ludo was about to go challenge

246
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,630
divine beast Varudania, but then his back started hurting again. No one will be, well, no one will

247
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:25,369
be challenging the divine beast today, it seems. Okay. Meet him there to let me, okay. This is where

248
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:44,739
we need to go. This is what we were doing before and it's right here. Cool. Let's go. Yeah. I've

249
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:48,969
been doing, I've been taking Nyquil to it in the evening hours because the thing about taking

250
00:56:48,969 --> 00:56:54,380
Nyquil is it just, it makes you just feel like you're on another planet sometimes, especially if

251
00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:09,539
you do it a couple of days in a row. I always try to space out stuff like Nyquil. You got to be

252
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:19,460
careful with drugs like Nyquil. It works, right? Stuff like Nyquil is, oh man, it works, but you

253
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:34,630
just got to be careful with that shit. All right. So let's do it. What's this gem? Am I ready to do

254
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:47,960
this? I mean, if there's ever a time to do it, I'm ready. Here we go. Jesus. You think I'm ready

255
00:57:48,889 --> 00:58:04,099
for divine beast too? Let's find out. Help me. Oh, it's not even a cut scene. Yeah, but taste

256
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:36,090
your own medicine. Fire. Really? Swing. All right. I am out of just basic shit weapons. What should

257
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:41,429
I use? I'm afraid to use anything. This is a whole, this is all collectibles. I don't want to take my

258
00:58:41,429 --> 00:58:45,739
collectibles out of the Saran wrap. You know what I mean? I don't want to take them out of the plastic.

259
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:55,159
What should I use? Just use them. I know, but they'll be ruined if I use them. I don't want

260
00:58:55,159 --> 00:59:07,659
to take them out of the plastic. I'm going to use, um, the, the Lionel sword. The Trident can't be

261
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:29,429
replaced. All right. Oh, thank God. A shit weapon that I can take out of the plastic.

262
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,449
I just took this thing out of the box, took the plastic off and freaked out and tried to put the

263
00:59:39,449 --> 01:00:06,820
plastic back on. All right. You good? Use ice arrows. What are you, a dope? Really? I tried to

264
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:28,260
press the other B button. Yeah. The other B button. Wow. You're crazy strong. Goro, you saved me.

265
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:38,730
Are we going to do the divine beast together? Hey, you guys understand? I just put fingerprints

266
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:53,349
on that sword and just reduced its value by like 50%. It's true. Not coming, but why? His back hurts.

267
01:00:54,230 --> 01:01:01,130
Okay. If boss can't help, there's nothing else we can do. I suppose I'll just head back now.

268
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:13,369
Please replace all the Goro's with Goku. That's right. Oh, you're not going back, but why, Goku?

269
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:20,539
What? I'm going to try to board the divine beast. Why do you think you, you know, what do you think

270
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:32,010
you are, Lord Durek? It's dangerous in there. How do I do it? Nope. I forgot how to do it.

271
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:39,260
Goku. I forgot. I actually don't remember how to do it. Okay. Why risk it?

272
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:52,340
Problem is good old boss raised the bridge of Eldin to make sure that that mean divine

273
01:01:52,340 --> 01:02:04,869
beast couldn't get over here. You lost his touch. Yeah. I won't. I'm, I'm don't feel well. Use the

274
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:10,949
cannon. You can't use the cannon if boss won't come down here. That means we're out of luck.

275
01:02:11,909 --> 01:02:17,030
Oh, it occurs to me that you know how to use the cannons. I do. Okay. Just shoot the cannons at

276
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:27,849
it. I'm going to be the cannon ball and you'll launch me. I've got Daruk's protection Goro.

277
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:32,969
My ancestors help can't possibly fail me. It means I can smash into anything and I won't hurt one bit.

278
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:53,860
Okay. Okay. Let's, let's shoot you out of a cannon. Oh, did I shoot him at the bridge?

279
01:02:54,659 --> 01:03:20,329
Is this lined up right? Shoot him into the lava. I'm looking forward to this Sims. I think that's

280
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:37,449
going to be a lot of fun. You good? We did it. Time to do the divine beast. Let's get a move on

281
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:58,699
across that bridge. Sims, let's go. It should be fun. All right. Let's get ready to move.

282
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:11,460
Bridge of Eldin. It's pretty cool looking. I need to talk to you. Divine beast Varudania is out

283
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:32,820
causing trouble again. Let's go stop him. I wonder how we get in. Definitely in his mouth.

284
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:54,789
He's going to go like, we have to run in. Or in his legs. Okay. Take out the

285
01:04:55,750 --> 01:05:12,340
drone things. What's this? Yikes. Sentry is always a nuisance no matter where it is or how many of

286
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:17,219
them there are. When finds you, Varudania will go nuts, which will cause Death Mountain to erupt

287
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:23,059
Goro. I always get spotted and magma bombs come raining down one after another. If Boss were here,

288
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:27,289
he'd swap those magma bombs away like they would nothing force his way up. I don't think you'd be

289
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:32,099
able to do that. I don't want to cause any trouble. Maybe the best idea is to give me a signal to let

290
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:45,300
me know when I should stop and when. Wait, what? Wink? How are you going to see that whistle? When

291
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:49,639
I hear you whistle, at least stop in my tracks or start moving forward. I like it. Even though

292
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:53,880
it's kind of like calling a horse. Okay. I'm counting on you. So I got to tell him when to stop

293
01:05:53,880 --> 01:06:05,500
and when to go. We just play red light, green light. All right, we'll go. Go do it. Yeah. All

294
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:17,829
right. You're ready. All right. You're ready. Just testing. I don't understand. I don't get it.

295
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:23,289
We have to scale this whole mountain together, but isn't he just going to walk behind me?

296
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:43,900
Why don't we just stay on the edge here? What are you doing? I don't get what's happening here.

297
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:55,500
Isn't he going to stop if I stop? I'm not telling him to do anything.

298
01:06:56,219 --> 01:07:25,880
Just don't go in the circle. Okay. So stay here. Don't move. How fast can you go? This is bait,

299
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:43,139
but I'm going to take it anyways. Can I shoot these down? Wait, can I move this?

300
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:29,930
Okay. We need to move these rocks out of the way. Stop. Don't go anywhere.

301
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:59,930
Jump. Why is this here? This is in a weird spot. Isn't this in a weird spot?

302
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:33,380
This doesn't seem so bad. All right. I'm going to get in here and I'm going to shoot you to...

303
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:50,090
Where am I going to shoot you to? Why would I do this? I don't want him to go that way.

304
01:09:51,100 --> 01:10:00,550
Why would I do this? This feels weird that I shouldn't be doing it like this, but whatever.

305
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:25,720
Let's try it. Was I not supposed to alert this creature? Did you do it wrong? We did it. Oh,

306
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:36,020
okay. We just have to keep doing it like this. All right. Sounds good. All right. We got these two

307
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:54,539
drones here. How far did they go? I'm doing it pretty good, I think. How far back did they come?

308
01:10:54,539 --> 01:10:57,899
This one stops there. This is going to be hell on earth. I already know it.

309
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,380
All right. This is as far as it goes. Let me take a quick... I need to take a look

310
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:11,989
because I'm going to screw this up. Is there any safe place? I have to keep moving the whole time.

311
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:38,229
So I have to take a picture. You stay here. I don't want you to get in trouble. I need to look.

312
01:11:43,479 --> 01:12:06,680
All right. There is a safe place right there. Ready to move? Let's go. Get in here. Stay right

313
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:15,210
there. All right. Then I go now, which would get me to... I don't know. Where am I trying to get to?

314
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:30,659
I got to go alone. There is a safe spot right in the middle. Is that accurate? Is it safe right

315
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:56,619
here? I think it's a safe spot right here. Oh! It is. Okay. Get over here. Let's go. Turn around.

316
01:13:02,329 --> 01:13:11,670
Oh! Fuck. Where do we go? What? Go, go, go, go, go... Turn around. Turn around, turn around,

317
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:17,850
turn around... Turn, turn, come back here. Back, stop, stop, stop, stop! I don't get it.

318
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:42,319

how many swings is it wait a minute why these rocks here why these boulders

377
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:42,159
lined up like this why is this boulder here to all right in my brain this is

378
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:45,880
like hey let's set up a little puzzle here we got this big boulder that you

379
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,960
could move and it's like it's really in frame and it's something you have to

380
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,960
look at and walk by and yeah maybe roll it down the hill so it gets sucked up

381
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:58,760
and then gets kids to think why are these here that's just bait it's just a

382
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:04,960
bait puzzle because honestly I could have just done this the whole time just do

383
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,880
this oh thank goodness I didn't get spotted

384
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:50,739

job getting the map of the divine beast the terminals that control Rudania are

439
01:49:16,569 --> 01:49:22,340
noted by the glowing points on your map to take back Rudania you'll need to

440
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:30,140
activate all of the terminals you got this little guy okay yes finally I can

441
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:48,000
see I'm gonna being able to see camera was a little high on the camera all

442
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:55,140
right so here we are I need to activate all these things this should be fun this

443
01:49:55,140 --> 01:50:01,310
is a beast it's a giant shrine it's like my favorite part of the whole game so

444
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:14,020
what can I do I can I can move this up or down put it back put it back put it

445
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:28,409

446
01:50:28,409 --> 01:50:39,470

01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:48,029
fucking this whole thing up all right I'm on my he's almost back no this is

448
01:50:48,029 --> 01:51:08,869

449
01:51:08,869 --> 01:51:13,020
try going this way first this is out we're kind of where I came in right I

450
01:51:15,779 --> 01:51:46,859
wonder if that out was in my mouth okay a ball has to go into here when do I get

451
01:51:46,859 --> 01:52:06,380
the ball just checking out all the rooms relax well you've died I think this thing

452
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:13,970
is all right so I have to touch that I wonder if I can just jump to this I'm

453
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:32,899
gonna try it that works got one there are four terminals remaining that's the

454
01:52:32,899 --> 01:52:47,479
way okay well now that I'm up here oh all right no I'm so pissed an idiot I

455
01:52:47,479 --> 01:52:56,250
didn't mean to do that um well I'm down here now so whatever I have to turn it

456
01:52:56,250 --> 01:53:23,670
again what's happening okay I'm gonna turn it this way again whoa all right okay all

457
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:34,569
right all right wait wait wait wait wait oh how do I get that I have to turn it

458
01:53:34,689 --> 01:53:50,649
but I'm not gonna fuck around right now maybe a minute link what the hell are you

459
01:53:50,649 --> 01:54:53,260
doing whoa come on I can't like that I'm getting turned around here all right let

460
01:54:53,260 --> 01:55:15,659
me what what is it what is going on here get rid of that there's one up on his

461
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:22,579
spine up there feel like I can get that one right now I'm gonna get that one

462
01:55:22,579 --> 01:55:28,819
right now check this out let's go hold on if I spin him I can walk along his

463
01:55:28,859 --> 01:55:43,739
spines that sounds correct there's also something over here too this might be

464
01:55:43,739 --> 01:55:53,760
stupid but whatever um I don't know let's try it wrong way I'm on the wrong

465
01:55:53,760 --> 01:56:27,380
side wrong side wrong side wrong side I'm going to the lava

466
01:56:27,579 --> 01:57:40,619
damn it what's this oh I found one oh I can't do this one I wonder if I can

467
01:57:40,619 --> 01:57:45,789
actually just brute force it and get up there I think I probably can but that's

468
01:57:45,789 --> 01:58:07,890
not the way I'm gonna try to do this so let's go up this way what's this eyeball

469
01:58:08,449 --> 01:58:16,420
all right I'm gonna do this right I feel like this is correct this seems like a

470
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:43,060
right way to do this one I do you I jump through it how do I jump through that

471
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:50,779
the one spot that I couldn't land on is where I landed I'm gonna try that again

472
01:58:50,779 --> 01:59:13,170
I feel like I can get it this way I do I need the blue flame to do that I think

473
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:26,819
it's I need blue flame okay well where's the blue flame can I grab one easily

474
01:59:26,939 --> 01:59:38,689
from here through window or something not really well let me just go I think I

475
01:59:38,689 --> 01:59:47,109
can get this one now right this is one on the spine oh please

476
01:59:47,109 --> 02:00:33,739
I'll take it really really where I was wondering if it was on that side of the

477
02:00:33,739 --> 02:00:40,649
other side there are three terminals remaining I love these these are so I

478
02:00:40,649 --> 02:00:48,800
would I love I would have an entire game that was just this stuff just give me

479
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:59,699
like 20 divine beasts and that's just that's the entire video game all right I

480
02:00:59,699 --> 02:01:07,329
need to light that blue flame where the hell was that I don't know we're here

481
02:01:07,329 --> 02:01:22,399
somewhere I want can I I'm just gonna spin it okay let's go

482
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:54,739
so if I go around here ah there's one right there hmm oops that's not how you

483
02:01:54,779 --> 02:03:19,939
do it I think I got it don't hands in your head me I got it now I do ha ha ha

484
02:03:19,939 --> 02:03:43,770
get away from me the other ones over here right cuz I flip it and then yeah

485
02:03:43,770 --> 02:03:46,210
I gotta get up here watch this so I could I flip it and it's gonna be this

486
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:56,960
way and then I can like this one right I thought I don't flip this shit and I

487
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:10,470
could come on there another one somewhere but that was the one all right

488
02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:18,060
there's another one though I swear there's another one maybe there's not

489
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:29,340
I lost it or is there another one well let's try to do this ball one then no

490
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:34,420
okay well I guess I'm wrong all right I need to go down to where the ball may

491
02:04:34,420 --> 02:05:01,859
have dropped where did the ball go nice is that better than what I have on for

492
02:05:01,859 --> 02:05:26,880
anything I guess I could get rid of this bow right where did the ball go I dropped

493
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:33,640
that ball down but I don't know where it is we're gonna drop down it was like a

494
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:59,239
tube shaft or something and where is it I don't know where it is it's gonna go

495
02:05:59,239 --> 02:06:22,460
down and look oh wait a minute what's this why is this in the way what did

496
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:55,300
that do I get it I get it I think I get it all comes down here and my wrong so I

497
02:06:55,300 --> 02:07:01,779
moved this out of the way turn it well it's frozen right and wait make any

498
02:07:01,779 --> 02:07:09,060
sense that makes sense to me and I'm gonna see if it does anything

499
02:07:15,449 --> 02:07:47,229
enough yeah one more after this more after this is what I meant all right so

500
02:07:47,229 --> 02:07:51,270
the other ones ones in the tail ones on the other side of his leg flip them

501
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:57,029
again all right this one's got all this grass shit all over it what does this

502
02:07:57,029 --> 02:08:03,350
mean can this be a lady but I don't have to do with this I think I'm stupid I

503
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:13,329
know what exactly what to do with this it's oh yeah that was easy

504
02:08:13,649 --> 02:08:39,970
that was simple it's the easiest one of the whole night get out of the fucking way okay

505
02:08:39,970 --> 02:08:46,460
just one terminal remain last one is in the tail wonder how hard this is gonna

506
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:54,619
be I think it's probably underneath them I gotta make them flip right something

507
02:08:54,619 --> 02:09:14,720
to do with this shit it's definitely something to do with that they go

508
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:32,670
outside and look I break this whoa hello let's open it all right cool I

509
02:09:33,189 --> 02:10:15,810
think I'm almost done with this I see probably a boss at the end right I pick

510
02:10:15,810 --> 02:10:34,180
up an object wait wait what am I doing when I fuck with anything in this room

511
02:10:34,180 --> 02:11:35,180
I pull this can't pull it off and burn that wait I can burn this that scared

512
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:45,760
the shit out of me oh wait I know to do okay ready watch this it's stupid or is

513
02:11:45,760 --> 02:12:01,770
this correct find out why is that not working oh I'm overthinking it just a

514
02:12:01,770 --> 02:12:20,890
little bit here all right let's go do I have enough like health to do this and

515
02:12:20,890 --> 02:12:32,930
weapons and shit and start up the main control unit which is up on his back

516
02:12:33,449 --> 02:12:38,479
there should be a new glowing mark on your map you're gonna need to make your

517
02:12:38,479 --> 02:12:47,789
way over to that stay focused all right so this is probably heat so I'm gonna I

518
02:12:47,789 --> 02:12:54,720
gotta be ready I do have a lot of food although not really I have to be careful

519
02:12:54,720 --> 02:13:16,960
let's get back up there which I use as a weapon probably I don't know like the

520
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:21,140
I'm gonna use like the ancient battle axe just giving this fucking thing

521
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:34,899

540
02:20:12,579 --> 02:20:18,079
divine beast am I the weirdo that thinks the shrines are the best part of this

541
02:20:18,079 --> 02:20:23,620
whole game I know I've asked this before but I they're the most fun I like the

542
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:39,649
little weird puzzles and little combat things I have already beat that game

543
02:20:39,649 --> 02:20:43,930
though years and years and years ago I would play it again they did a remaster

544
02:20:43,930 --> 02:20:48,600
of it didn't they I feel like I should apologize doing all I could to protect

545
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:53,340
Hyrule when that thing got the best of me sorry that me resting with the rubble

546
02:20:53,340 --> 02:21:00,889
cause such a mess the good news is Rutani is now back under our control

547
02:21:00,889 --> 02:21:07,290
that means that our century-old Ganon beatdown plan can finally go into effect

548
02:21:07,290 --> 02:21:12,250
I'm gonna take this down the mountain I'll have a better shot at Ganon there

549
02:21:12,250 --> 02:21:17,819
and then once you've made your way into Hyrule Castle we're gonna light that

550
02:21:17,819 --> 02:21:21,059
thing up feel like this guy's still talking from like a thousand feet away

551
02:21:21,059 --> 02:21:26,940
give you something it's a special power of mine called Daruk's protection it's

552
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:40,159
no good to me now that I'm a spirit but it might be useful for you new power so

553
02:21:40,159 --> 02:21:44,520
I'm going to assume that you can just run to Ganon at the very first ten

554
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:49,010
minutes of the game and try to beat it in an hour that accurate you don't have

555
02:21:49,010 --> 02:22:02,930
to do all this that's cool from this moment for the power of protection yeah

556
02:22:03,049 --> 02:22:14,209
my soul now lives inside you good luck little guy a lot of people did give my

557
02:22:14,209 --> 02:22:20,530
regards to the princess that would actually be kind of sad if on your first

558
02:22:20,530 --> 02:22:23,010
playthrough you'd be in the first you've been waiting for this game let's say for

559
02:22:23,010 --> 02:22:28,440
like five years and you just go I'm gonna go investigate the castle and it's

560
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:32,260
the end of the game and you just like beat the whole game and you just oh fuck

561
02:22:32,260 --> 02:22:41,079
oops didn't mean to do that this is huge map and you just don't explore any of it

562
02:22:41,079 --> 02:23:13,340
you see the credits that did happen you'll have three hearts though yeah you

563
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:29,040
can beat the game with a stick damn

564
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:38,670
well that ought to do it we're set here now we just gotta wait for the perfect shot once Link is in the

565
02:23:38,670 --> 02:23:45,340
castle Brutania will unleash an epic blast Ganon won't know what hit him

566
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:55,340
looks pretty good from up here even after a hundred years the old rolling

567
02:23:55,340 --> 02:24:01,260
ground sure are a sight for sore eyes I wonder how the warrants fared after the

568
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:07,290
great calamity I sure hope everyone down there is still going strong after every

569
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:32,340
hey look at that still going strong indeed oh by the way son pass down our

570
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:53,760
family power to somebody else it's not you link has it he does have it oh never

571
02:24:53,760 --> 02:25:11,659
mind okay so protective power containing the perfect defense of the champion

572
02:25:11,659 --> 02:25:16,020
Daruk it will automatically protect you from all manner of attacks as long as

573
02:25:16,020 --> 02:25:30,670
you're holding the ZL really oh fuck don't do that how long does it last so

574
02:25:30,670 --> 02:25:38,760
it's generally just if it's a you take three hits for free that's pretty

575
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:48,360
helpful three blocks then it recharges it's very useful though cool cool cool

576
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:56,500
cool cool very cool alright I'm gonna complete this mission and I need a

577
02:25:56,500 --> 02:26:05,850
spirit orb thing because I want to I should just probably stamina thanks so

578
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:09,889
much I don't exactly know what you were doing in Rudania but well it seems to

579
02:26:09,889 --> 02:26:13,290
have calmed down you know while I was up there I could have sworn I saw Lord

580
02:26:13,290 --> 02:26:18,129
Daruk standing on top of Rudania I wonder was that his ghost I don't know

581
02:26:18,129 --> 02:26:22,510
how to explain it but somehow I feel a lot braver now oh that's right I talked

582
02:26:22,510 --> 02:26:26,629
to boss about you and he said to bring you to him an order from brass can't be

583
02:26:26,629 --> 02:26:38,340
refused move it on those like fun okay I need us one of those shrines this one

584
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:43,459
here somewhere right he said earlier you would play a game full of only divine

585
02:26:43,459 --> 02:26:56,440
beasts that's basically every other Zelda game yeah somehow different is that

586
02:26:56,440 --> 02:27:15,059
true uh I need where's a there shrine here it's right in every town right was

587
02:27:15,059 --> 02:27:26,100
the boss have to say side side on the main dude's house okay you really are

588
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:29,979
something I can't believe you conquered Rudania telling me impressed but good

589
02:27:29,979 --> 02:27:32,899
graves you have to do it just when my back pain went away I was already in

590
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:42,620
go now you may look like I was just vivid about my back pain oh and I'm also

591
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:46,420
happy to see you know Bo finally got his act together yeah I know that's you're

592
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:50,299
doing as well but enough back padding and other such nonsense take a look at

593
02:27:50,299 --> 02:27:56,930
this calm down it's returned to his peaceful ways now we can get back to

594
02:27:56,930 --> 02:28:03,379
digging for ore around Death Mountain all right still gonna thank you wait why

595
02:28:03,379 --> 02:28:10,229
did I did I do I get an item there's some treasure in my house actually get

596
02:28:10,229 --> 02:28:17,430
stuff all right it's a sharp blade yep weapon over as a Hylian you probably

597
02:28:17,430 --> 02:28:20,850
already know apparently a hundred years ago the Hylian champion had a legendary

598
02:28:20,850 --> 02:28:25,090
blade the sword that seals what would they say the sword sleeps in a forest I

599
02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:38,989
already saw it I have already found it 13 hearts right what's my treasure

600
02:28:38,989 --> 02:29:02,440
boulder breaker that thing's huge nice boulder breaker very cool all right let

601
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:08,409
me not use that the next like 12 hours of gameplay you know I think I you know

602
02:29:08,409 --> 02:29:10,969
I thought about this joke and I'm not gonna do it because I think it would

603
02:29:10,969 --> 02:29:15,209
really piss everybody off I've been really thinking contemplating this if I

604
02:29:15,209 --> 02:29:19,770
should do this or not but I'm not gonna do it so you can just laugh at it now

605
02:29:19,770 --> 02:29:22,930
all these weapons that I've been hoarding for the longest time and I'm

606
02:29:22,930 --> 02:29:26,329
just never gonna use them I was thinking of when I get to Ganon at the end of the

607
02:29:26,329 --> 02:29:32,530
game just all throw every single one of them at him and break them all just like

608
02:29:32,530 --> 02:29:39,889
one two three and just see what people do I but I know I feel like I could

609
02:29:39,889 --> 02:29:46,319
break I feel like I could fuck up the whole game I'm actually concerned to do

610
02:29:46,319 --> 02:29:51,120
that but just know if you see me do that that's like the like the laugh out loud

611
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:55,709
thing that I was planning because I'm never gonna use these that's like you

612
02:29:55,709 --> 02:30:00,719
know you always hold on to your shit the Resident Evil bullshit where you get the

613
02:30:00,719 --> 02:30:03,719
rocket launcher half way through the game you don't shoot it once you have

614
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:07,840
like eight rounds for it and then you just shoot the fucking tyrant eight

615
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:21,879
times with the rocket launcher and then watch the credits roll all right so look

616
02:30:21,879 --> 02:30:29,100
at the shrine over here there is all right should I do hearts or stamina what

617
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:39,729
do I have one two three ten hearts I could get to ten hearts yeah that's

618
02:30:39,729 --> 02:31:01,780
probably safe almost at a second row right it's ten and ten and ten if you're

619
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:07,260
wearing pants which is unlikely can we have an outfit tour I got pants on I'm

620
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:15,459
not gonna give you an outfit tour okay cool so that's that and that's where I'm

621
02:31:15,459 --> 02:31:20,780
probably gonna end the stream I'm gonna go take another dose of medicine relax

622
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:25,739
I'm glad I was able to stream today though cuz I don't I feel like I've been

623
02:31:25,739 --> 02:31:32,180
like away from my personal broadcast for a little while and I really did not when

624
02:31:32,180 --> 02:31:36,989
I got COVID a few days ago it was just like fuck I hadn't streamed like a week

625
02:31:36,989 --> 02:31:43,989
before that I took a long break in October so I really want to participate

626
02:31:43,989 --> 02:31:52,860
but yeah he's radioactive no I'm fine we get an outfit tour here's your outfit

627
02:31:52,860 --> 02:32:02,850
tour there but yeah tomorrow the plan is now again I have to make sure that I if

628
02:32:02,850 --> 02:32:09,739
I wake up and I'm really screwed up VR is gonna have to move a day but the plan

629
02:32:09,739 --> 02:32:17,639
is sus guy rebrand tomorrow and we're gonna play among us VR I think I've

630
02:32:17,639 --> 02:32:21,559
already talked to a few people obviously Vinny was interested I think Charlie was

631
02:32:21,559 --> 02:32:27,000
interested too in playing and his group there that we might say hello to them

632
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,920
for a little bit I might just bounce around whoever's playing it right I might

633
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:37,909
just like I don't want to be annoying though because that scream is good is

634
02:32:37,909 --> 02:32:44,440
essentially one just huge joke to me right cuz I mean the whole you'll see

635
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:50,129
tomorrow but wherever I can bounce around as the fucking sus guy scream

636
02:32:50,129 --> 02:32:55,979
that's where I'm gonna go we'll see yeah I'm sure there's a lot of people that

637
02:32:55,979 --> 02:33:01,260
are gonna be playing it this thing with among us you need like you need like 30

638
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:04,819
people right you need like 20 people to play it so I have to I'm gonna have to

639
02:33:04,819 --> 02:33:11,520
just jump in a random lobbies or play it with like a group like um like like I

640
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:16,920
said like Charlie and some of those were interested so but I need to be

641
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:21,399
better and if I'm gonna be in VR I need to take the time now to go just chill

642
02:33:21,399 --> 02:33:25,799
and just put my head down keep an eye on the sauce if for some reason it's all

643
02:33:25,799 --> 02:33:30,200
fucked up for some reason I'm do you understand the core gameplay of among

644
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:36,729
us I have no idea here's what I know I know that you have to pretend to do jobs

645
02:33:36,729 --> 02:33:43,239
and if you're well you have to do jobs but if you're the imposter you have to

646
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:49,559
pretend to do them too and kill people while you're pretending to do stuff I've

647
02:33:49,559 --> 02:33:53,319
never played among us before I don't even understand how it works all I know

648
02:33:53,319 --> 02:33:57,219
is that oh man I saw this guy in admin that's the only thing I said emergency

649
02:33:57,219 --> 02:34:03,159
meeting I don't even know what that means I don't know what that means it

650
02:34:03,159 --> 02:34:08,989
just means like hey call in a meeting to determine who killed who I'm just gonna

651
02:34:08,989 --> 02:34:12,030
the first lobby I'm in dude I'm pressing the button fucking immediately

652
02:34:12,030 --> 02:34:18,260
and then I'm gonna turn and like run and cartoon break through my fucking drywall

653
02:34:18,819 --> 02:34:26,860
Bugs Bunny style and then uninstall the game this should I should have a big

654
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:36,770
button I got there I have a COVID and I got one day to prepare this so I don't

655
02:34:36,770 --> 02:34:45,159
know I don't think so I don't think I can even have a huge button in the

656
02:34:45,159 --> 02:34:50,829
middle of my room when I'm playing it that would be so funny though if there's

657
02:34:50,829 --> 02:34:54,430
just a huge red button and I have to go to press it I don't even know where it

658
02:34:54,430 --> 02:35:04,579
is we'll see what I can come up with in the next 12 hours my eight-year-old

659
02:35:04,579 --> 02:35:09,559
brother saw you on my screen and said oh my god that's the sus guy by the way

669
02:36:01,629 --> 02:36:06,430
I'll probably turn it off like halfway through I don't know we'll see it's

670
02:36:06,430 --> 02:36:12,450
gonna be unbearable there's gonna be like I don't know you'll see it's gonna
