1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:39,270
Hello. Hi. Hey. Hey. Hello. Hello. Ster. How are you? Welcome back to the stream. We had a stream a couple days ago. Hello. Hi. Would you wait? Hold on. Play that again. Hello. Hello. Why do you still have this shit like fucking four years later? Hello. Uh, cause I had no need to replace it. Why would you still have a recording of me from like four years ago? I, it's one of the most valuable things I own. All right. Can I get an invite please? I got, I got to launch the game.

2
00:00:39,270 --> 00:01:12,200
Okay. So do you want to, uh, do you want to be the one to tell everybody that what, what we did? Because you sounded so paranoid that I'm surprised you would even say anything has been done at all. You don't think that when we open up our menus and show our skill points on stream, people will be like, what the fuck is going on here? You know how you guys, you have the please do not remove this under federal law things on your mattresses. Like we pulled it off. Not only did we, we didn't pull the whole thing off. So there's like still little,

3
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,129
a little bit there. So there's evidence and people can clearly see that we've been hampered with the device.

4
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,250
I'm just saying we're going to have to address it.

5
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:35,849
You don't open up your menu and see that we have like 20 extra skill points to be like, wait, what? You're in the same zone. You were just in. No one, no one remembers from last time. No one watched from beginning to end, except for my mom.

6
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:47,560
Is your mom still a big fan? Yeah. She told me all about, she was watching and catching up on the pod and she really, yeah, that's so cool.

7
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:50,909
All right. You want to invite me?

8
00:01:51,549 --> 00:02:09,789
I'm hold on. I'm going to continue. Okay, chat. This game takes so long to level up. We just love, we just, we ripped the mattress tag off and now we have the cool skill points and we can drop kick zombies. Send me to jail. Send me to jail. Fair enough.

9
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:19,069
I'm going to change my stream title. Hold on. Cause I'm not doing GeoGuessr anymore. Did you know that GeoGuessr is like an updated thing and now you have to pay for it? You don't have to.

10
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:21,710
I have never used GeoGuessr.

11
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:22,229
What?

12
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,389
I have, I don't, I wouldn't know any of this.

13
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,199
You've never played GeoGuessr?

14
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,349
No.

15
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:36,379
You should. I feel like you'd probably like it. What's a good title? Just literally the next sentence you say will be my title.

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,039
Came in pants, still gaming.

17
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,479
It's not going to be that. It's not anything else. Say something normal.

18
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,419
Something normal.

19
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,819
Anything else besides what you just said. Another sentence, please.

20
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,840
Uh, you're putting me on the spot.

21
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Why would you fucking say that?

22
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,259
I mean, like, I,

23
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,740
You were always the title guy when, when, when,

24
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,939
I was the title guy?

25
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:06,580
You were always like, you had the funniest titles. Your titles were always so funny.

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,199
Well, you just denied my first one.

27
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,360
Because your title that you just gave me is like, I feel like I would get in trouble for writing that in my title.

28
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:26,340
Um, you could just write, no, that's lame.

29
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,379
What was it?

30
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:38,500
You'd write Sterma, perma, and then like six hearts. Like a bunch of emojis.

31
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,310
Uh, okay. Sterma, perma?

32
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,389
Yeah.

33
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,030
And then hearts?

34
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:46,949
Yeah.

35
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,669
Don't do like, don't do like the less than threes. Like actually go to Google and copy a heart emoji.

36
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,789
I don't want to do that shit. That's too much work.

37
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,460
Wait, perma means like permanent, right?

38
00:03:58,979 --> 00:03:59,419
Yeah.

39
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,699
Okay. It's not something weird thing that you're like making me, right?

40
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,900
What else would it mean?

41
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:04,460
I don't know.

42
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:11,189
I don't know. You, you just, the last thing you just told me to do was say that I like did something into my fucking pants.

43
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,550
And I'm not going to just put whatever the next thing you say with a little bit of scrutiny.

44
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:15,909
I want it.

45
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,240
I just wanted you to have the greatest clickbait title you could have.

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,680
I wanted you to succeed.

47
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,110
All right. Can I get an invite?

48
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,279
Uh, yeah.

49
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,560
Yeah.

50
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:30,579
Okay. I guess we cheated. I'm sorry.

51
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,019
We cheated and, and, and I don't want to get in trouble for it.

52
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,779
He, it was his idea. It had nothing to do with me.

53
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,860
I actually fought against it.

54
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:45,019
Sterma, temp.

55
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,980
Are you in the game yet?

56
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,670
Yeah. I just invited you.

57
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,269
No, you didn't.

58
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,160
Uh, my whole, um, the whole world just saw me invite you.

59
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,639
So.

60
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,800
Oh, okay. I got it.

61
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,230
Should I do the thing again where I just like.

62
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,670
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

63
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,029
I got it.

64
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:07,029
Okay.

65
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,670
It's your screen.

66
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,069
I know.

67
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,230
I'm not in the game yet.

68
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:10,970
Yeah.

69
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:11,329
Yeah.

70
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,610
The BRB screen is still there because I'm not technically back.

71
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,949
Okay.

72
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,230
I've loaded in.

73
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,870
I am now technically in the game as of right.

74
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,350
I'd say right now.

75
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,939
Have you ever had a naked on stream?

76
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,100
Like dream?

77
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,540
A naked, a naked on stream dream.

78
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,500
Like you had a dream that like, oh my God, I'm naked.

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
A connection to the game.

80
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,860
Your session is, could not be established.

81
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,660
You have to invite me again.

82
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,199
No, I've never had a, a naked in.

83
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,079
I just have a lot of school dreams.

84
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,240
Like I'm back in school.

85
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I had one last night.

86
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,550
It's always just like, fuck school again.

87
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,230
Really?

88
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,709
How, like, how much school does one person need?

89
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:56,870
All right.

90
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,790
I'm in, is that you?

91
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,189
Where are you?

92
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,319
You got my box.

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
Let me get my screen correct here.

94
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,220
Okay.

95
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,620
Should be dying light too.

96
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,379
There it is.

97
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,149
I mean, like I have nothing to hide.

98
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,259
Like if I walked on camera nude.

99
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,100
If you walked on camera nude, then you don't think that you would

100
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,420
like to get in trouble for that.

101
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,540
I think I would get banned for three days, but I think on all the

102
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,860
websites where they like post nude people, like, uh, the drama streamer

103
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,259
stuff, I think that would probably be the best thing that could happen to me.

104
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:35,699
All right.

105
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:36,620
So what are we, where are we going?

106
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,220
The last thing we did, we, um, we unlocked like the actual

107
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,259
video game last time, right?

108
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,300
Um, yes, I think maybe.

109
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:45,730
Yeah.

110
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,129
And we also unlocked all these moves that you guys don't remember.

111
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,209
And we, we, we got like 50,000 points of experience.

112
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:55,129
Um, if you don't remember the last, uh, mission we completed.

113
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:56,089
Yeah.

114
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,810
They, they just like, they said, wow, you unlock the new area.

115
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,649
You're also going to need all of these experience points for it.

116
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,209
All right.

117
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:04,490
Let's go find Barney's place.

118
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,069
We got to go to Barney.

119
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:10,069
Face cam?

120
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,430
No, I don't, I don't want face cam.

121
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:11,870
I have a headache.

122
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,379
It wasn't face cam on last time.

123
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,300
I have to, it has to be consistent.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,360
Why, why do you have a headache?

125
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,339
I don't know.

126
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,259
Cause I had a dream.

127
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,500
Every time I have a dream that I remember, I have a headache.

128
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,379
Does that work for you too?

129
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,819
Whoa.

130
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:29,220
No.

131
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,339
Really?

132
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:30,860
Is that something?

133
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,779
That's not, that's not at all related to the content of the

134
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,500
dream being you nude on stream.

135
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:36,579
No, no.

136
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,379
Every time I have a dream that I can remember, I have a migraine for the whole day.

137
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,660
It's been like that since I was like 16, 15.

138
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,579
I don't know why.

139
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,959
I think your, your brain's broke.

141
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
I mean, I've had an MRI of my brain like twice and they just say,

142
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,480
Oh, it looks okay.

143
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:57,620
There's a quest giver here.

144
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,579
Inside?

145
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,860
No, like, like, like this Bush is a quest giver, apparently.

146
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:06,350
I think they're in the building.

147
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,389
No, we're, we're not doing that.

148
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,589
By the way, we're going to the yellow.

149
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:16,410
We're going to find Barney's house, whether you like it or not.

150
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,449
Cause Barney's going to show us to the new area and he's going to give us like,

151
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:20,490
Oh, what was that?

152
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,129
There's a flare.

153
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:22,170
We're going to the foot.

154
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,810
You see the flare.

155
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,250
Oh my God.

156
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,529
Yes.

157
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:24,970
Let's go.

158
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,589
Somebody needs help over here.

159
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,039
Help him get them up.

160
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:37,899
Help him.

161
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,580
All right.

162
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,059
200 experience.

163
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,539
That's pretty good.

164
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,259
That's pretty good.

165
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:50,940
Do you understand that for the rest of the whole game, we're not going to be able to

166
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,179
put points in because of the fact that we cheated.

167
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,500
Yeah, I know.

168
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,460
Exp means nothing right now because we're like 20 hours ahead and experience points.

169
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,059
Yeah, but they gatekeep being able to do a power attack.

170
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,299
It's a power attack is the third tier of ability where you just hold down your

171
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:07,899
mouse button.

172
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,360
I will agree that having that hidden was the flare.

173
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,710
This was the guy shooting it.

174
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,590
It was.

175
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,299
Yeah, you just ruined the dying light to experience.

176
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,509
Well, I mean, that's not necessarily true because this is the last time either one of

177
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,470
us is going to play this game.

178
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,909
I kind of have a knack for ruining games for Jerma.

179
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:39,919
So, I mean, we've been playing for just about, well, like eight to 10 hours with

180
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,639
including the single player stuff we had to do.

181
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:42,539
Yeah.

182
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,539
I'm completely happy with getting to this point and we're at like 13, 15 hours of

183
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:48,139
like gameplay.

184
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:48,740
I'm all right.

185
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:49,259
That's okay.

186
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,889
What was the last time you finished a single player game that wasn't a from

187
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:53,450
a software game?

188
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:56,529
Finished a game.

189
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,809
So the place should be empty now, but I don't know when they'll be back.

190
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,610
That's a good question.

191
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:06,740
Literally.

192
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,419
I got to tell you this.

193
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,179
Oh, oh, shit.

194
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:12,879
I got goop.

195
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,679
I got goop to bad.

196
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,649
Why is my immunity critical?

197
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,629
Because we walked through the group.

198
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:19,590
You're going to have to mushroom.

199
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,830
What do I do?

200
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,909
That was this one.

201
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,350
Press two and you switch to your things and you got your mushrooms, your power ups

202
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,269
or your users.

203
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,269
I got it, dad.

204
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:30,750
Okay.

205
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,269
Thank you.

206
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:38,299
Uh, where's Barney's up in this building up there.

207
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,080
Let's get up there.

208
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,809
They're going to say they do a lot of talking in this game about how nighttime

209
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:47,610
is super dangerous.

210
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,889
I like, you know, I kind of like this, like do like more than one thing on

211
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:53,409
stream thing.

212
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,289
That's kind of cool.

213
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:54,730
I like that.

214
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,409
Have you never done more than one thing before?

215
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,289
I mean, not really.

216
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,250
Maybe like once or twice.

217
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,299
It's like, instead of just one thing for like five to seven hours, it's like two

218
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:11,259
things for like two to three hours each.

219
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,820
I feel like you would realize that earlier, considering you like, like super

220
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,340
ADD.

221
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:18,620
Excuse me?

222
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,370
It's not a bad thing.

223
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:21,690
Hold on.

224
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:22,409
Excuse me?

225
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:23,649
I'm unlocked.

226
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:23,970
Okay.

227
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:25,929
Okay.

228
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
I'm just going to like, pretend like you didn't say that.

229
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,179
Like, what the fuck?

230
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:31,580
Okay, dude.

231
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:41,389
Um, Oh, yeah, you already took this one.

232
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:42,350
Yeah.

233
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,990
This was the same mission from before when, oh, right.

234
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,110
Yeah.

235
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,110
With the things and the stuff and there was people here.

236
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,750
And where's Barry?

237
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,580
Barry is in here somewhere.

238
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Barry season three over here.

239
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:00,340
Like you said, Barry, it's just about us being friends.

240
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,629
It's just like you said, I don't think there's anything I need to do about that.

241
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,909
Barry.

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,769
It's like you said, how come you're not laughing at that?

243
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:12,889
I'm doing the guy from Barry.

244
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,279
Um, thank you.

245
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:23,340
That wasn't Mr.

246
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,820
Satan.

247
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:26,970
I don't, I don't remember that part.

248
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,970
And I feel like of all the things you don't remember that part from, that is

249
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,250
like the best character in Barry.

250
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:34,700
Which one?

251
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,570
It's been so long, like four years.

252
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:40,889
Actually has been a long time.

253
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:44,299
Yeah.

254
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,820
Search Barney's hideout for evidence.

255
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:50,049
Everyone's always hiding stuff behind these really heavy planks.

256
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,970
Three voices, Andy.

257
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,139
Oh, there's no evidence.

258
00:12:58,419 --> 00:12:59,220
There's something right here.

259
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,659
Oh, there is something right here.

260
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:05,190
I wonder what she says.

261
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,629
What's that?

262
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,710
I found the tattoo they cut out of Lucas.

263
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:11,909
It cut his tattoo off.

264
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,110
Throw up.

265
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,700
We did a little piece of Lucas to remember him.

266
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:20,779
Just sicko.

267
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,950
That ain't mine yet.

268
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,389
Lucas's you shitter.

269
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:28,669
Wait, didn't he just swing?

270
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:29,909
Yeah.

271
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,710
Where are you?

272
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:32,750
I'm right here.

273
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:40,470
All right.

274
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,470
Let's both hit him with a charged up swing at the same time.

275
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,809
One, two, three.

276
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,679
Did you even hit him?

277
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,580
We kill.

278
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,100
Wait, did you just stomp his head?

279
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:56,700
Yeah.

280
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,659
I jumped on his head.

281
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,220
She's next.

282
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,230
We still have level one weapons.

283
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:13,649
Yeah.

284
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,809
You cut the tattoo from commander Lucas's.

285
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:18,409
Oh, shit.

286
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,009
It was her.

287
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,009
Okay.

288
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:22,730
Now we've got to fight him.

289
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,169
I'll kill you.

290
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:31,580
We need to know.

291
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,100
Where did this piece of skin come from?

292
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,580
Sophie could have been planted to set us up.

293
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,740
Who's planting skin in your head?

294
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,259
I'm going to plant a cut somebody's skin off and plant it in

295
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:43,779
their drywall.

296
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,340
And when somebody finds it, I don't think it was them.

297
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,600
How do you come in here and demo this house and put that in there

298
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,559
and then hide it with a plywood plank?

299
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,809
I'm going to say, okay, if I came home and I went up into my

300
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:05,889
bedroom and there was a huge piece of fucking plywood against the

301
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:10,570
wall, would you know it must always be there?

302
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:13,289
He's only looking for a reason to raid the bizarre.

303
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,259
Someone you'd be like, why is that there?

304
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,759
Well, we didn't have to fight them.

305
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,610
Lame.

306
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:23,850
Where did they go?

307
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,330
This is the apocalypse German.

308
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:32,700
Nobody is demoing omega low, but you wouldn't notice that this was here.

309
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,639
This is something you don't notice because there's a piece of huge

310
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,759
piece of plywood in front of it.

311
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:40,940
That's what I'm saying.

312
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,500
It must always be that way.

313
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,220
Why are you expecting like they'd live in this luxury home in the

314
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
apocalypse, like they don't have holes in their wall?

315
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:49,929
All right.

316
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:50,610
What's our quest?

317
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,610
We got to go get this guy a permit.

318
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,289
Very important question for Easter.

319
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,970
Three, two, one.

320
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,649
Do you call them quests or missions?

321
00:15:57,809 --> 00:15:58,090
Go.

322
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,409
Quests.

323
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,409
Loser.

324
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,009
Why am I a loser?

325
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,850
It's a mission.

326
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,139
That's a very important question.

327
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,539
Like this isn't magical fucking 1400 Europe.

328
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,110
Hey, well, I think this game calls them quests.

329
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,909
And based on what you said in the previous session of them being

330
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,509
called community gifts, subs, I think you have to concede to what

331
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:20,950
the game is describing them as.

332
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:21,909
I'm having a little bit of trouble here.

333
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,629
Trying to see, uh, do you see the elves anywhere?

334
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:27,269
Uh, not seeing any elves though.

335
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,080
Okay.

336
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,320
I am definitely seeing some, uh, more to how chivalry style medieval gameplay.

337
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,830
Uh, do we, we don't have a quest.

338
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,470
Fuck.

339
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,990
That was bad.

340
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:43,870
That was really bad.

341
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:47,389
That was so bad that it was made up for a joke, but it wasn't.

342
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:49,970
Wow.

343
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,889
Unbelievable.

344
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,330
I'm going to take that loss.

345
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,490
That's a big problem.

346
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,409
I can't fucking believe that just happened.

347
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,649
That had to be fake.

348
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:02,330
Hold on.

349
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,289
I'm looking up the missions.

350
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,349
Cancel the throw.

351
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
What does it want from me?

352
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:16,700
It's a massive L.

353
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,500
It really was Jesus.

354
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,750
I have a headache.

355
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,150
All right.

356
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,349
It's like hard to concentrate.

357
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,309
Our quest is wait for Sophie's call.

358
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:29,950
So we just have to walk around.

359
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,710
Yeah.

360
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,630
I think we just like, let's just go like hop around.

361
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:39,339
I'm following you.

362
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:40,259
You're the one that knows where you're going.

363
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,859
I don't know where Sophie's call is.

364
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:46,759
I think it's a pay phone.

365
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:56,740
Yeah.

366
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,900
We do have level one weapons because look at how long it takes to hurt anybody.

367
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:01,420
Yeah, we do.

368
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,329
How do you level up your weapon?

369
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,500
Well, we're still fighting level two enemies.

370
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,500
Like some of my weapons are level two.

371
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,220
Oh my, what happened?

372
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:14,180
How'd you do that?

373
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,619
Drop kick.

374
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,660
You jump and you mash E or kick.

375
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,200
Kick, kick F.

376
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,759
Oh, holy shit.

377
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,519
That's crazy.

378
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,420
Who needs the weapon when you got a drop kick?

379
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:29,730
All right.

380
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,250
Let's keep going.

381
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,289
Wait for that call.

382
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,470
Watch out.

383
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:39,190
There's a boomer over there.

384
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:40,109
Boomer.

385
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,720
L plus ratio plus headache.

386
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,440
Plus you fell out.

387
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,059
Watch out.

388
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,009
We got Zeds coming.

389
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:07,849
Uh, I'm going to sneeze and I can't mute because it's too far.

390
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,009
What do I do?

391
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:09,650
Give me a word to say.

392
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:11,940
I come in pants.

393
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,220
Nope, I'm not saying that.

394
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,740
What the fuck?

395
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:22,859
Oh, the chase is on.

396
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,799
I jumped off a zombie's head and went, you go like three stories.

397
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,380
Do you see this?

398
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:30,059
What?

399
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,420
I'm trying to run a look at this zombie parkour.

400
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:35,660
Holy shit.

401
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,460
How did you do that?

402
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,309
I don't know.

403
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:46,140
Oh, I'm my, I'm my immunity is, is, is in critical condition.

404
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,849
We're at chase level one, dude.

405
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,819
No, you.

406
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,339
I'm going for this UV light.

407
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:03,859
Is that my foot?

408
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:04,900
It's the only safe place for miles.

409
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:14,299
They can't get me here.

410
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:19,140
In the tomatoes.

411
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:23,619
You think zombies would eat these tomatoes?

412
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:25,769
Yeah.

413
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:28,289
See, this is like, this is more what I was talking about.

414
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,289
Instead of having like one tomato vine, you got like 10.

415
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,210
Is he going to?

416
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:45,150
Yes.

417
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,829
I think they put the UV lights here because the zombies would be taking

418
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,390
potatoes, put the tomatoes.

419
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,710
He said potatoes.

420
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,509
I said wrong.

421
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:52,109
I'm going to say it.

422
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,009
Can this lady call us?

423
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,660
No.

424
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:00,380
Oh, wait.

425
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,740
I think we have an actual marker now.

426
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,119
Oh, we do.

427
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,619
Yeah.

428
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:06,420
We got to go to the place.

429
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,940
Yeah.

430
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:17,980
He's bringing out these, bringing out the spie voice, but we didn't get a call though.

431
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:23,390
Is that a problem that we were waiting for a call?

432
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,599
Can you just go to the fucking quest diamond?

433
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,069
Are you going to play Elden Ring?

434
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:35,880
Uh, yeah.

435
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:38,809
Are you going to beat Elden Ring?

436
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:39,769
Like you didn't beat Sekiro?

437
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,579
I mean, I saw the last boss in Sekiro.

438
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,539
That's pretty much beating it.

439
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,819
That's true.

440
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,019
And like, what else is there?

441
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:59,759
You remember you and me, both of us, desperately co-opping orphan.

442
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:01,960
And we just couldn't do it.

443
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,519
I do actually.

444
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,400
And we both just gave up.

445
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,859
We did.

446
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,450
We co-opped orphan and gave up.

447
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:13,009
And I mean, this wasn't, we didn't just try for like 10 minutes.

448
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:17,970
This was like two plus hours of us just co-opping orphan and not being able to do it.

449
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:26,299
And I think we both said the same thing that you just said, which was, I mean, like we, we pretty much, we got them down to like 30%.

450
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:26,660
We saw it.

451
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,539
I mean, we pretty much beat it.

452
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,299
We, we like, we know there's nothing else after them.

453
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:31,500
Are we on?

454
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:40,289
We got, I think you're going the wrong way.

455
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,240
What do you mean I'm going the wrong way?

456
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,880
I'm going the right way.

457
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
I'm going towards the diamond.

458
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,970
I'm running across the rooftops.

459
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,690
I'm using my injected hyper serum to be able to do incredible jumps.

460
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:56,730
How do you do that?

461
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,970
Fantastic maneuvers.

462
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,130
I don't know.

463
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,809
We just cheated and I didn't even know what we did.

464
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,009
So like, how do you do that move?

465
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:07,369
I had it before we cheated where you, you press space to climb over something.

466
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:13,079
And as you're doing it, you press kick and then you look, look at me, look at me.

467
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:13,880
Yes.

468
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,440
Look at me behind you.

469
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,220
Look, practice.

470
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,299
Okay.

471
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:20,900
So is that F?

472
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:24,779
You, you, you press your jump button to go over the thing and then your kick

473
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,700
button as you're doing it and then you go to space.

474
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:29,940
Oh, I got a new skill point.

475
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,230
Oh, I bet you cheated for that one too.

476
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,380
All right.

477
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,099
I'm just going to put it in here.

478
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,180
All right.

479
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,380
20.

480
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:42,740
Here we are.

481
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,539
Who am I playing with?

482
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,009
This is stir twitch.tv slash stir.

483
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:00,930
S T E R.

484
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:08,619
Twitch.tv slash stir youtube.com slash stir.

485
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:10,539
What are we going to play borderlands?

486
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:12,299
What?

487
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm going to ask if we were going to play borderlands too.

488
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,369
And I, oh, did they ask you that like a year and a half ago?

489
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:20,329
And you just replied now.

490
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,259
This thing is insane.

491
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:27,339
73 damage.

492
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:36,930
This guy's got level six weapons, probably because we're level probably

493
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,930
because, uh, don't, don't buy these.

494
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,890
Don't buy them.

495
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,450
I already did.

496
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:41,890
I don't buy it.

497
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:43,839
Wow.

498
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,559
Well, okay.

499
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,559
Someone's cheating.

500
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,759
I need all the players up here.

501
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,519
Hey, stir, who are you playing with?

502
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,319
Oh, this is German nine eight five.

503
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,519
The guy that used to do a little gem.

504
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:07,289
This is madness.

505
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:09,910
Oh, peacekeepers have more.

506
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,789
Yeah, that's me.

507
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,789
They will crush us like worms.

508
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,230
Nobody gets that reference, but the people that do really thought that was

509
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:27,039
funny because it was remote C four.

510
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:27,920
Let's go blow someone up.

511
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,740
Okay.

512
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,900
I think they just, they just, I think we just got a mission.

513
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,339
I think we do have a mission.

514
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:43,539
Yeah.

515
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:47,940
Remote decoy.

516
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:49,220
No, I thought there was C four.

517
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,799
I need more scraps because I want to make more molotovs.

518
00:25:58,579 --> 00:25:58,900
Okay.

519
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,460
Well, this guy wants to talk to us.

520
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,240
Is this the guy from the servers?

521
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,539
They're making fun of me.

522
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:14,140
Oh, okay.

523
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:15,019
My chat is too.

524
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:17,819
Very mean.

525
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,480
Okay.

526
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,079
Let's do it.

527
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay.

528
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,119
Okay.

529
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,890
All right.

530
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,849
I was my new weapon.

531
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:36,059
This thing here.

532
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:36,299
Okay.

533
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,319
Go to the water tower for the explosives.

534
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:47,940
Oh, can I tell you that I was laughing at the Sopranos punch, the propane tank

535
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,819
thing, the rest of the night.

536
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,380
And even, and even until like two, like a day ago, I thought that was

537
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,500
the funniest goddamn thing.

538
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:00,670
I'm surprised that was, that was the thing.

539
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,990
It was just so perfect.

540
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,390
It was so stupid.

541
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,109
That's the other way.

542
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:14,269
You started a chase, man.

543
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,640
How do you get to chase level four?

544
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,039
What's that mean?

545
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,779
I mean, do you want to try?

546
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:31,460
No, I don't.

547
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,660
We just need, okay.

548
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,539
He doesn't actually care.

549
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:40,059
Probably just intensifies how many zombies are fighting you.

550
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,380
I feel like dying light one.

551
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,339
Here's my review.

552
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:46,779
I'm, I'm 1000 experience points in.

553
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:47,339
You are.

554
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,740
Okay.

555
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:48,259
I am.

556
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:49,940
I feel like dying one was a better game.

557
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,420
Oh my goodness.

558
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:51,819
Okay.

559
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,180
Almost every way other than like graphical fidelity.

560
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,099
Okay.

561
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,069
Now I'm ready.

562
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,470
I'm ready to make that assertion.

563
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:02,269
Okay.

564
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:04,109
So the, you think dying light one was a better game.

565
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,910
Is there any specific reason as to why you feel that way?

566
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:11,309
Um, I feel like I'm not threatened at all by these nighttime chases.

567
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:13,869
It's actually really fucking bright out the whole nighttime.

568
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,630
The zombies, it feels like there's a lot less of them.

569
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,269
Like before, when you'd throw firecrackers in the street, it was like

570
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:21,990
the entire street was full of them.

571
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,390
Um, and they felt a little bit more, you know, a little bit more dynamic,

572
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,950
a little bit more cream cheesy, a little bit more, um, a little bit more squishy.

573
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,710
The propane tanks feel like they, they blow up and like, it's a one foot square

574
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,680
in this, just, just, everything's a little bit, a little bit diminished.

575
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,089
This chase level one, like I'm not, don't you remember like hiding in the

576
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,609
dark and being scared of zombies?

577
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,109
I'm muted.

578
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:45,670
Aren't I?

579
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,029
No, you're not.

580
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:46,390
No, no, no.

581
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:52,500
I remember, I remember hiding in the dark, hiding in the dark.

582
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,180
It's always, yeah.

583
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,140
I don't, I think dying light one, where are they?

584
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,059
Like the weird super.

585
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:57,740
Also, it had guns.

586
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,740
I miss guns.

587
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm going to say it.

588
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:00,259
Where are the guns?

589
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,500
Wait, I don't, were there guns in dying light one?

590
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:03,420
Yeah.

591
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:07,460
You would, uh, you would, um, that's why I wanted to get in the police trunks.

592
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,019
Cause sometimes they'd have like handguns in them.

593
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:12,380
Yeah, we're, I don't remember the being guns.

594
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:19,559
There were, was a dying light one.

595
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:21,740
Yes.

596
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:25,930
I mean, there was also cars in the DLC.

597
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,369
We never, yeah, but that's, I don't think that's a fair, uh, assumption there

598
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:34,259
because, well, you know, you know what, actually I played dying light like a year

599
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:38,339
ago, I think, I don't know why, but I returned to it randomly and played it for

600
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:39,980
like a day and had some mods on it.

601
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:49,339
And, uh, I wonder overall good game, but like, it feels like, I don't know.

602
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:51,019
I wonder what's going to, okay.

603
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:56,289
When do you think we're going to see like innovation in the like video

604
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:00,849
game, like AAA world is that I feel like we've been in this kind of, kind of

605
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,809
like quest marker over somebody's head.

606
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,289
And like pick stuff up scavenge and craft in the crafting menu.

607
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,970
I feel like we've been playing like the same far cry game for the last like 10 years.

608
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,809
They have been making the same far cry game.

609
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,539
So what would, like, is this going to, do we just keep doing this?

610
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,299
Yeah, why not?

611
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,430
It's not a problem, right?

612
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,430
Like it's until, until like a modern invents auto chess and then every

613
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,230
company tries to make auto chess.

614
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,809
It's kind of weird because like fallout, right?

615
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:41,769
All that was the, oh, I can pick up plates.

616
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,690
That's kind of interesting.

617
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,450
I can pick up like cigarettes on the ground and plates and stuff.

618
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,539
And then every company decided that that was like not cool anymore.

619
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,420
So instead of picking up like plates, it's like, just pick up like med

620
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:00,500
pack craftable kit one and med pack craftable kit to scrap metal.

621
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,099
Like, it's not like I can break the plates down and just, it's just, they kind

622
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,859
of like oversimplified it in a way.

623
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:06,740
Yeah.

624
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,339
Can you look up?

625
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:07,900
I'll be in touch.

626
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,900
Oh my God.

627
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,500
Oh my God.

628
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:16,700
What perfect right up the butt.

629
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,519
That's how I want to go.

630
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:26,609
Shoot the plates.

631
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:27,809
I don't know.

632
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:30,930
I just, I feel like we, a lot of people have been doing this.

633
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:40,339
Wait, wait, wait, this is, oh my God, same tuber joke over and over again.

634
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:41,700
And there's casualties everywhere.

635
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,900
Look at all these YouTubers.

636
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:48,779
You scared the shit out of me.

637
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,660
I guess if you were like tabbed out and you just hear me go, Oh my God.

638
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,819
Oh my God.

639
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,819
Like somebody's like, I just got like strangled.

640
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,720
So he just like attacked me in my room.

641
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,279
Hey, you remember dying light.

642
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,920
Here's the real comparison.

643
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,680
They even do this in the tutorial where you like walk through the subway and it's

644
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,920
like all in the subway in the dark.

645
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,880
There's like a whole bunch of them.

646
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,839
I remember there being so many zombies.

647
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,920
You like, couldn't move.

648
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,079
If you got off the top of a truck, it was like you were surrounded by six

649
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:25,019
layers of dudes and now it's like, uh, there's like five, you know, there's a

650
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:27,779
few guys in here, but is it, okay.

651
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:31,339
Is it just easier to kind of develop a game like that?

652
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,170
That's just, Hey, there's, we have like these few, these like five or six, like

653
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,890
crafting items to make stuff.

654
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:42,450
And then there's like all these markers that are in the game for you to go like

655
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:45,609
get experience points to touch them.

656
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:45,890
Yeah.

657
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,220
Well, here's the other question, right?

658
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,180
Let's be fair.

659
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,140
Let's be fair to, to be fair.

660
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,900
What else, what, uh, what's the next step, right?

661
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,660
Like, how do you make a video game like this better?

662
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,019
What do you do?

663
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,789
Like, oh, we have this monster zombies and this system and it's like a city

664
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:09,609
street and there's cars and what, what's the, what's it left to do?

665
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:12,049
What's in the details.

666
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
Do you see that video?

667
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,400
The probe account man always does like comparison videos and did one for left

668
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,019
or dead versus back for blood.

669
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,420
Yeah.

670
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:28,819
Yeah.

671
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,059
But it's a little things.

672
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,700
So I don't think it's, we need more stuff.

673
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,539
We need just more passion.

674
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:36,779
I know.

675
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:42,230
I think I've always said this that after half life one, everyone should have

676
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,430
collectively said, this is so realistic.

677
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,589
These graphics I can see Gordon Freeman and they should have just stopped

678
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:53,539
improving graphics, but at the same time though, right?

679
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:54,180
Think about this.

680
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:57,210
Like golden eye.

681
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,529
Do you really need more than like one square for a person's face?

682
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:02,410
Let's be realistic.

683
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,690
Not really, I guess.

684
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:10,599
No, but there's a lot of indie companies and indie devs that are doing exactly

685
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,199
that and they're doing just fine.

686
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:12,440
Right.

687
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,239
I mean, have you played a lot of the first brain too?

688
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,679
I have not played it a long time ago, but it's still good.

689
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:22,380
Oh, okay.

690
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,260
Let me, let's be honest.

691
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,179
Let it be, be, be, but give don't negative, negative, negative.

692
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,780
Everything's negative like this stuff here.

693
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,800
I go prevent infection like this, like artwork and like crafting, like a

694
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,599
scene and this like building, right?

695
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,079
The wanted, but this is somebody put a lot of time into this and this is

696
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,559
actually like a very interesting, um, like piece of architecture and stuff.

697
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,400
Like that, that the pieces by themselves are actually really, really interesting.

698
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:50,739
Yeah.

699
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,900
It's almost like when they all come together and like the game is turned on.

700
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,940
It's like, you have to sacrifice a lot for all of those pieces to look that good.

701
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,400
Yeah.

702
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,679
And you gotta put a little budget in that.

703
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:10,320
And why does it matter when your game is sold based on how it looks in a

704
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,659
commercial rather than how it plays?

705
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:14,579
Cause once they're playing it, they already bought it.

706
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,769
But also too, every game does not need to be, I mean, look, it's some, some

707
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:24,409
piece, some people just kind of want to jump in a game and run around and

708
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:25,530
collect stuff and kills on pieces.

709
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,130
Is that a problem?

710
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,010
I'm saying for me, dying light, here's the analysis.

711
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,289
Dying light one for me was like a nine out of 10 game.

712
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:32,010
I really enjoyed it.

713
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,329
Yeah.

714
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,929
It was a little bit flawed, you know, can't give it the 10 and you know,

715
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:35,650
I'm not going crazy.

716
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,650
It's no bloodborne out here.

717
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,610
This game I'll knock like two points off.

718
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,130
It's a seven.

719
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,690
It's a totally like, yeah, good game.

720
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:44,940
Yeah.

721
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,619
I mean, I don't know.

722
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:46,739
We're still fine.

723
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,789
It's tough because, uh, wait, are we supposed to kill these people?

724
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,110
Apparently.

725
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,849
Why am I sliding down here?

726
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:10,099
Uh, I don't, I, I, I don't know.

727
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,739
It feels like we've been in the same video game since like 2014, 2013.

728
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:19,500
Okay.

729
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,960
If you were to take a screenshot right now, I wonder if somebody would like do an

730
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,639
experiment like this.

731
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,079
I get rid of the HUD and just take a screenshot and like a ton of games that

732
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,800
have come out that are open world games like this and see if somebody can guess

733
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,380
the game or guess the date.

734
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:35,619
Yeah.

735
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,769
Depends how generic of a scenery it is with trees and whatnot.

736
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:41,130
Yeah.

737
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,900
I would actually have a lot of trouble.

738
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,739
Can we get some fucking zone too?

739
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,219
No, this is, this is the podcast.

740
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:55,820
This is the, the stirring German talking about games.

741
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,659
Well, to talk about the game, I want to like see area too.

742
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:03,019
Cause the tutorial area where you start in the mountains was like ridiculously

743
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:03,460
beautiful.

744
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,179
If you're talking about take a screenshot of this and see where it's from.

745
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,739
Like, is this, is this Spider-Man?

746
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,440
Hope I can grab that.

747
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,360
Am I Spider-Man?

748
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,409
Open world games are overdone.

749
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,860
Yeah, but I feel like people are afraid to not to make something that's not open

750
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:30,099
world because it's not enough and people expect it to be like a GTA five level

751
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:30,420
map.

752
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:38,739
You know what you're experiencing is the games that are formulaic are the ones

753
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:43,050
that are marketed and you see them more often because they are built to be

754
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,210
financial successes.

755
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,070
So they get marketed super hard and the ones that are a little bit more

756
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,110
experimental don't have a budget for that kind of thing.

757
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,630
And they don't know how to market it.

758
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,269
So you're like, Oh, all these games don't exist, but you're just not seeing

759
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:54,750
them as much.

760
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,150
Interesting take interesting take.

761
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:58,989
That's a, that's a little bit of my take.

762
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,030
Very interesting take here.

763
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:02,869
I killed them.

764
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,719
Can we open this door?

765
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,219
They're still there.

766
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:31,699
And another thing that makes a problem is, I mean, I feel like this is kind of

767
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:32,619
shitty to say, but I'm gonna say it.

768
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,340
Oh shit.

769
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,460
I feel like a lot of newer games in the last five, 10 years.

770
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:42,139
What happened?

771
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:44,630
What happened?

772
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,070
What happened?

773
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:51,500
Whoa, use the medicine, use the medicine.

774
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:52,260
Why can't I open this?

775
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,300
It's made out of straw.

776
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:58,320
All right.

777
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,239
How do I throw a grenade?

778
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,849
I'm really mean to say this, but you were going to say what?

779
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:03,530
Okay.

780
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:08,489
What I was going to say is I feel like games nowadays don't want you to play

781
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:11,650
the game for more than five minutes before they start talking to you.

782
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,170
I think, you know what?

783
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:18,010
Like dark souls nowadays.

784
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:22,349
Well, no, just like, like, I mean, the last like 10 years, like recently, like,

785
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:25,949
I think people love dark souls because the game doesn't like talk to you every

786
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:26,670
fucking five minutes.

787
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,630
Yeah.

788
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:30,710
New AAA games, the last five, 10 years.

789
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:31,869
It's like, go do this.

790
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,269
And now let's talk about it for like an hour.

791
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,510
I kind of just want to play the game, right?

792
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,590
Like, it's more play it and like story and like, we've got to have like an

793
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,309
elaborate story of a guy trying to find his daughter.

794
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,630
It's like, do we really need to have all that?

795
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,630
Like, can I just play the game?

796
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:55,539
No, I feel like this is all stuff I said to you like eight years ago.

797
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:57,300
And you're like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

798
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,050
I just want to like skip this.

799
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:00,449
Don't you?

800
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:01,650
No, I, okay.

801
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,250
Go watch dying light one.

802
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,409
Right.

803
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:08,250
There is a part of that game where we are skipping every single cut scene and

804
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,130
going skip, skip, skip, skip.

805
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,010
Yeah.

806
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,489
So I was on board.

807
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,130
I was on board.

808
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:13,849
Okay.

809
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,000
Well, this is, this is, how did you feel about the new doom?

810
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,880
I didn't, I didn't play it.

811
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,840
I don't think he's references.

812
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,559
Did you get one before that?

813
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,280
I played 2016.

814
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,519
Yeah.

815
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:27,840
Okay.

816
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,639
So I'm going to start here.

817
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,519
Everyone really liked that game because it starts the game and it makes the joke

818
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,039
of like you talking to the intercom and you're just like, no, I'm doom guy.

819
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:35,400
Fuck this.

820
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,639
And then you go play the game.

821
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:36,920
Right.

822
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,519
And everyone's like, Oh dude, it's just like, you know, action.

823
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:41,320
We like playing this game and it's a really fun game.

824
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,960
And we weren't like bogged down by story.

825
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,960
And like they do have the intercom guy come in, but it doesn't really

826
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,159
interrupt the pace of the game.

827
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,159
Doom eternal starts with a fucking cut scene of characters.

828
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,880
You have no idea who they are and all this weird shit.

829
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,480
And it keeps slowing you down and giving you all these bizarre cut scenes.

830
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,519
And it's like they, they did it right.

831
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,719
And I'm curious what made them go the complete opposite

832
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,079
direction on the next game.

833
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,760
Do game companies do focus groups and stuff and ask people how they feel about

834
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,599
things now, or did that happen now?

835
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,880
Or I wonder if there's like focus groups that are like, you know what?

836
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,280
I really want to know what happened to this guy's daughter.

837
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:21,449
I, okay.

838
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:22,530
Imagine, imagine this.

839
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,289
You're in a focus group.

840
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,610
They're asking you like, Oh, what's your opinion on how to improve this?

841
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,329
But you enjoyed the thing, but they're really, really want to know how to improve it.

842
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,650
Do you just make up like, Oh, I mean, I guess I like, don't know his motivation.

843
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,889
I mean, I guess like if there was, you know, like I don't understand why I was there.

844
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,769
And then they get that feedback and they're like, Oh shit, we need to fix that.

845
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:42,610
Even though you're just like, you only made it up because they

846
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,730
really want it feedback.

847
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,070
I don't know.

848
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:47,869
Do you read into that?

849
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:48,909
You do.

850
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:49,110
Okay.

851
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,550
But actually you started Valley, right?

852
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:51,469
Yeah.

853
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:51,710
Okay.

854
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,869
Started Valley started Valley had like a story about like your grandfather's farm.

855
00:41:55,869 --> 00:42:00,320
And there was like this corporation that it was okay.

856
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,760
By the way, I just got to cut you off.

857
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,719
This is exactly what I mean about this game.

858
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,039
What did I do that?

859
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,199
I'm seriously jumping and hopping around in circles while these guys, these guys

860
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,599
do not feel threatening at all.

861
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:13,239
We're just like having a conversation.

862
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I don't know what's going on.

863
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:23,659
I, we have to collect items from the thing, the box, but there's these big guys.

864
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,480
Are we just like kind of weirdos and talking about how we don't want cut

865
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,880
scenes in our video games anymore?

866
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:36,599
I mean, calling you weirdos.

867
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:37,760
Are they question marking you?

868
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,440
No, no.

869
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,159
I think about this is, I don't think this is that unpopular of an opinion.

870
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:41,440
Okay.

871
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Well they all grew up on like Tik TOK and Twitter.

872
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,519
They're like already on the next video.

873
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,280
They like click next already.

874
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,800
No, they didn't.

875
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,320
They're still there.

876
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:54,090
Well, I mean, that's a new, that's, they're not, that's a new person that just showed

877
00:42:54,090 --> 00:43:02,619
up, but I hate to kind of sit here and be like, everything is bad and I'm smart

878
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:03,539
enough to see it, right?

879
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:09,780
Like, but I kind of feel like I've been playing the same game for 10 years, but

880
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,219
was it like that back in like the eighties and nineties too?

881
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:13,099
Like, right?

882
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:14,019
Are we just like in a cycle?

883
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:14,460
I don't know.

884
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:16,260
It definitely was.

885
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:20,780
Can you start opening these boxes so I can, I don't know.

886
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,940
There's like these big guys with these, these hammer.

887
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:30,329
I don't think we're supposed to fight these guys.

888
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,320
What's this?

889
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,639
We have to click kill at least one of these guys.

890
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,360
And why was that?

891
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,159
Why did that even hit me?

892
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:53,840
I got everything we needed.

893
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,260
I need to craft some heels bad.

894
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:05,570
Is this health?

895
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:06,489
I don't know.

896
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,050
I think so.

897
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:07,530
Yeah.

898
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,210
I can't people understand the potential of the medium instead of trying

899
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,570
to make interactive movies.

900
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,130
Um, I don't know.

901
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:28,940
How did you do that?

902
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,239
I probably have like wall running.

903
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:32,639
You don't.

904
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,320
I think I have that though.

905
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,199
I just ran at the wall.

906
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:39,559
Oh, we're going to go.

907
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,389
All right.

908
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:47,550
We're going to go this way.

909
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,429
Okay.

910
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:49,110
Follow me.

911
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:57,230
It's because of money, but do these games sell that well?

912
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:58,980
I don't know.

913
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,099
I guess they kind of do.

914
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,139
They have to sell a certain amount of well, so you can only make a

915
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:08,179
certain amount of risk.

916
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:11,099
And if you're putting a certain amount of marketing into it, you can expect

917
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,460
to sell a certain amount of copies.

918
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,019
And it's a very, like, if you deviate from that formula, how much of your

919
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:19,820
own money are you investing to put into it to be like, well, this weird thing

920
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:25,530
might work, but I feel like if you did something also keeping in mind that

921
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,130
you're like a dude that doesn't play games and you're the one who's

922
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,570
like bankrolling the company.

923
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,170
Video game boomer podcast residence sleeper.

924
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,059
No, we have to turn our compressors up to a hundred.

925
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,559
You have a go XLR, right?

926
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:44,920
Yeah, I do.

927
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:47,340
Can you guys hear me?

928
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,860
Turn your compressor up to a hundred percent.

929
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,889
Oh, we doing this?

930
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:53,610
Yes, we are.

931
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,329
Okay.

932
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:04,909
So, I mean, the thing is it's like, you don't sound any different.

933
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:06,070
I don't sound any different at all.

934
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,170
Maybe a little, maybe a little bit.

935
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,170
You think I don't sound different at all.

936
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:10,449
Do I?

937
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,349
I think I sound a little bit different.

938
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:15,699
Yeah.

939
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:16,739
I don't think I sound different.

940
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:17,739
Oh my, oh God.

941
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:17,900
Yeah.

942
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,739
You can turn it up a little bit.

943
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,300
Turn it up.

944
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,940
My like threshold.

945
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,139
Okay.

946
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,579
Just turn, turn compressor to a hundred percent.

947
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,219
I mean, that's the thing though.

948
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,440
I think that as we get older, I mean, you're getting older too.

949
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,719
We're getting to a point where we're getting older.

950
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,710
You, we're starting to see maybe what we don't like in the industry.

951
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:40,190
I'm not getting old.

952
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:41,750
Yes, you are.

953
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,409
How am I getting older?

954
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:44,739
Yeah.

955
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,380
Do you not want to say your age on stream?

956
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,940
How old are you?

957
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:48,300
31.

958
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,860
Well, that's not super old, but that's still older.

959
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,699
But aren't you like, like 53 now?

960
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:54,739
Getting there.

961
00:46:55,179 --> 00:47:00,039
I feel like when you say old, it's a very different reality of what I'm living.

962
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:06,460
But I think that the issue at hand is we grew up in the eighties and nineties

963
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:08,019
surrounded by these games.

964
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,260
I did not grow up in the eighties.

965
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,780
You, you grew up in the, okay, you grew up in the nineties and get, get a

966
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,179
little closer to the microphone by the way.

967
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:18,219
I'm not picking up the, uh, okay.

968
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:23,469
So we grew up in the nineties and honestly, we have a different perspective.

969
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:24,829
We have a perspective.

970
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,190
That's a lot different than a lot of the younger generation here.

971
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:34,159
And I think that we need to use all of our perspectives across old and young

972
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,480
to be able to come up with solutions for these problems.

973
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:38,670
What's the problem?

974
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:42,670
The problem is these video game companies that might be, oh my God, you

975
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,030
just kicked that lady in the face.

976
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:45,309
Don't go overboard.

977
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:46,469
I'm still doing my radio voice.

978
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:48,429
You kick that lady directly in the face.

979
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,750
And I found it to be something that was a, that was a problem.

980
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:52,789
And let's talk about why that was a problem.

981
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:53,670
Yeah.

982
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:54,789
Innocent people.

983
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,510
You don't, you don't just drop kick in the face.

984
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,789
And I think that that speaks to something about our current world.

985
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:04,090
And the game incentivizes it through experience gain.

986
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,210
You know, you're correct there.

987
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,889
Let's do, let's, let's, let's deep dive that.

988
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:11,489
So you got experience for hitting that innocent person, for instance, like

989
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,250
I'm going to get experience for hitting this innocent person.

990
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,289
Oh, these guys, this one gives a quest.

991
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:16,650
Okay.

992
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,179
Let's deep dive them.

993
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:22,980
All right.

994
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,059
I'm turning my compressor off.

995
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,619
It really doesn't sound that different.

996
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:28,179
You're just talking.

997
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:28,980
Who's this guy?

998
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:31,349
What?

999
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:31,949
Who is that guy?

1000
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:35,980
Random NPC.

1001
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:44,110
Now I can laugh because I'm not doing a little funny routine.

1002
00:48:44,469 --> 00:48:46,070
You drop kick that lady off the building.

1003
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:48,320
Yeah.

1004
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:49,519
What the fuck?

1005
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,960
I skipped a nighttime so we could do the night mission that we just

1006
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,639
accepted from these people we just talked to.

1007
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:55,480
And I don't know what it is.

1008
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,909
It's 169 meters away.

1009
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:18,849
Whatever it is, you talk, say something.

1010
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:19,809
It's boring stream.

1011
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:34,750
Um, I was doing something dead air, dead air, the podcasters nightmare.

1012
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:36,190
Here, come over here.

1013
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,170
Come over here.

1014
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,219
Yes, I am here.

1015
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,059
What do you want me to do?

1016
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,789
Wait, I, can I not do it to these people?

1017
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,019
I don't think I can do it to him.

1018
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:56,099
Nevermind trying to break this guy's neck.

1019
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,380
No, I wasn't.

1020
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:02,829
That didn't make any sense.

1021
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:03,670
We're on a quest.

1022
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,469
I've doesn't have to make sense.

1023
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,469
We're in the game.

1024
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:13,849
Just, just throwing some dead air out there until the conversation changed.

1025
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:16,630
Oh, we got flares.

1026
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:18,840
Well, all right.

1027
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,139
All right.

1028
00:50:20,139 --> 00:50:21,059
Here comes content.

1029
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:32,409
That was well, he got it first aid.

1030
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:33,940
Here, hold on.

1031
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,579
I got this guy.

1032
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,420
I got, I wonder if you're going to kill him.

1033
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:38,539
I wonder if you can kill him.

1034
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:44,739
I just took something out of his pocket.

1035
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:47,929
It's not falling over.

1036
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,849
No, he's not falling over.

1037
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:52,570
That's the thing that's really funny in these open world games.

1038
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,650
You make him fall.

1039
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:54,409
Fucking bye.

1040
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:55,650
I'm, I'm bored now.

1041
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:58,079
Come on, do it.

1042
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:00,940
I can't, that guy won't fall over.

1043
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:01,539
He's immune.

1044
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:05,059
No, he's going to fall and we're going to like slap high fives.

1045
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:06,719
Oh, the quest is right here.

1046
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:08,920
He's talking shit to somebody.

1047
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,039
He's talking shit to you.

1048
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,650
He's like, yeah, what the fuck are you going to do about it?

1049
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:15,130
You want to do a quest?

1050
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,150
You interested in this quest down here?

1051
00:51:19,389 --> 00:51:19,590
Yep.

1052
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:20,949
Hey, gas can.

1053
00:51:30,139 --> 00:51:31,900
Inhibitor container is nearby.

1054
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:34,809
Oh my fucking God.

1055
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:35,409
I didn't grab it.

1056
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,119
Oh shit.

1057
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:43,320
We got a goober.

1058
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:46,610
Is that health?

1059
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,739
These inhalers.

1060
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,900
I don't know which one is healing.

1061
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,219
Watch out.

1062
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:53,099
We're getting goobered.

1063
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:55,460
The quest is right here.

1064
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,019
We're going to go in.

1065
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,480
Oh shit.

1066
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:58,840
It's right there.

1067
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,590
You don't need to run.

1068
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:07,820
All right.

1069
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,900
Where, where, where, where is it?

1070
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:11,739
Search the ground floor of the dark hollow for Theodore.

1071
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:13,639
Theodore.

1072
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:15,719
He's in here somewhere.

1073
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:16,360
This chemicals in here.

1074
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:16,920
We're going to be quick.

1075
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:17,960
Oh shit.

1076
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,559
There's chemis.

1077
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:20,820
It or.

1078
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,989
I'll use your game with our vision.

1079
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:33,889
There's some vodka.

1080
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,090
You can't use enemies nearby.

1081
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:35,329
What?

1082
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,619
Watch out for the chems.

1083
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:45,940
Okay.

1084
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,550
You can only be in here for like another minute, by the way.

1085
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:55,389
Well, if you walk right here, you kind of reset.

1086
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:58,619
Are we sure that they're in here?

1087
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,789
It says look on the ground floor.

1088
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:02,869
They're going upstairs.

1089
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:03,670
Sounds wrong.

1090
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,019
Um, can't use enemies nearby.

1091
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:15,420
What?

1092
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:15,820
Yeah.

1093
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,019
The inhibitors in that room.

1094
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:18,139
We have to get rid of the chase.

1095
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:20,539
Oh, we have to get rid of the chase.

1096
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,659
Well, chase will go away if we stand in the light.

1097
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:28,510
Will it?

1098
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:30,480
Or are they not going to stop?

1099
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:31,940
Chase ended.

1100
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,389
Right.

1101
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,579
You're today.

1102
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:36,940
Send it.

1103
00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:39,219
I believe it's ended.

1104
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:40,309
Okay.

1105
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,989
Be stealthy.

1106
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:42,909
Is the ground floor up or down?

1107
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:43,309
Are you sure?

1108
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,510
Is the ground floor up or down?

1109
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:46,550
Go fuck yourself, dude.

1110
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,130
Okay.

1111
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:53,659
That's going to be a, that's going to be a, maybe not talk to you for a while.

1112
00:53:54,260 --> 00:54:04,500
Closer to kill Monica sent me.

1113
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,260
Weren't you talking shit about how like in-game cutscenes annoyed you?

1114
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,219
Yeah.

1115
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:13,780
Would you rather have in-game cutscenes or mass effect dialogue choice?

1116
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,880
When it, for the, for no reason.

1117
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:18,719
I'd rather, I'd rather have neither.

1118
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,340
Who of these have mattered?

1119
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:26,289
I'm a gamer and I love gameplay.

1120
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:28,969
I love true authentic video gameplay.

1121
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:35,929
I love the classics.

1122
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,050
I'm talking like Assassin's Creed two.

1123
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,639
That was a, someone was like, we're serious?

1124
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,920
Wasn't the Assassin's Creed the first one, a couple, weren't they pretty good?

1125
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,059
Uh, I hated the first one.

1126
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:55,739
I know that I am.

1127
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:58,780
I'm morally opposed to the first Assassin's Creed game.

1128
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,780
I hate, you know,

1129
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:00,500
Hold on.

1130
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,059
If you hate story, I'm at the pearly gates and they're like, you got to

1131
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:05,659
like Assassin's Creed one, I'm going to hell.

1132
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,260
That's the criteria.

1133
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,300
You're at the St.

1134
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,420
Peter's is sitting there.

1135
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:14,980
He's wearing, he's wearing like an Ubisoft t-shirt.

1136
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:15,900
Yep.

1137
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:16,940
It would be.

1138
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,659
How did you feel about Assassin's Creed one and two?

1139
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,019
Okay.

1140
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:28,260
You are saved.

1141
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,780
You're so, Jay started.

1142
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,420
One was trash.

1143
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:48,260
Run, run, dude.

1144
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,420
I'm running.

1145
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:50,659
I'm, they're getting me.

1146
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,349
Okay.

1147
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:56,460
You, you want to continue being negative, negative?

1148
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:57,900
No, we're not being negative.

1149
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,739
I'm, you want to be like a more negative?

1150
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:00,460
You do this to me.

1151
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,900
You want to know what I hate?

1152
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,239
You know what I really dislike?

1153
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:05,760
No.

1154
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:07,820
Why not?

1155
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:08,619
All right.

1156
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:08,980
What is it?

1157
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:09,900
Is it video game related?

1158
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,059
It's the health bars on enemies.

1159
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,579
Health bar that you can turn them off.

1160
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:17,659
Well, no, like specifically like Assassin's Creed, the new Assassin's

1161
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:20,860
Creed Odyssey, where you can stealth assassinate people and kill them in one

1162
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,380
shot, but if you accidentally walk to a level 50 zone where they have their big

1163
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,460
health bars above their head and you're like, I can't assassinate this guy anymore.

1164
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,099
And it's like, the fuck is this game then?

1165
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,900
What was the whole like Assassin's Creed?

1166
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,860
Like I'm a stealth.

1167
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:38,889
I can't stealth kill him because he's, he's too higher level than the, do you

1168
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:39,530
know who I am?

1169
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,530
Why don't you try making a game?

1170
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,809
My name is Ezio, Ezio, Edziri Beneficio or something.

1171
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:46,769
Oh no, you try making a game.

1172
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:48,869
It's too hard.

1173
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:49,869
I'm not going to fucking do that.

1174
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:51,309
That's a waste of time.

1175
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,260
Just have nerds like this sitting around all day, critiquing it.

1176
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:02,440
Need all players.

1177
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,119
I'm cooming.

1178
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:10,039
Upgrade.

1179
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:17,969
I upgraded my health booster and upgrade the immunity booster.

1180
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,250
All right.

1181
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:27,500
But anyways, yeah, I think, I think that we're, what'd you do?

1182
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:29,579
Where's your father?

1183
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:30,260
They would do in New York.

1184
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,360
Wait, wait, wait.

1185
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,880
I have a question before you go forward.

1186
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,000
We have skipped every dialogue.

1187
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,320
Yes.

1188
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:42,519
Like we, we don't know what's going on.

1189
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:53,949
I mean, we have an idea, but, um, have, I don't know how to put this.

1190
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,710
Hasn't each mission kind of still felt like, like the same, like it doesn't

1191
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,949
matter what they had said to each mission is kind of like the same.

1192
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,989
I mean, by that, you could say that about a lot of things, but yeah.

1193
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:06,349
People saying Mario RPG has dialogue.

1194
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:06,869
Why do you care?

1195
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:12,480
Because Mario RPG was kind of an interesting story.

1196
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,349
Mario RPG was interesting.

1197
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,550
You can't say that.

1198
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:20,110
You just know, you're not allowed to say that because I'm sorry.

1199
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,730
This is, if this game's fun, it is, but like zombie apocalypse, find your daughter.

1200
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:30,389
We've, I've seen this movie a hundred fucking times.

1201
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,670
It's not your daughter.

1202
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,269
But you know what?

1203
00:58:32,269 --> 00:58:32,869
It doesn't matter.

1204
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:34,510
Replace daughter with any other person.

1205
00:58:37,429 --> 00:58:38,630
Where's the vaccine though?

1206
00:58:39,469 --> 00:58:39,949
That's what I mean.

1207
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,150
Like we, I've, I've seen this movie.

1208
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:47,389
Mario RPG is a movie that I haven't seen since.

1209
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,260
What about, um, in fact, they deleted half the characters from the fucking universe.

1210
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,900
So how dare you compare that to this?

1211
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,139
Considering that like Mallow is dead.

1212
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,059
They killed him.

1213
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:01,619
How dare you say the shit you're saying.

1214
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:05,059
What I'm pretty sure the last of us two won like best writing ever.

1215
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:06,380
And it's also a zombie game.

1216
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:13,800
Don't be zoomed.

1217
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,010
Well, everyone we know is dying.

1218
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,690
Let's be, let's be real.

1219
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,929
Cause people can critique us on our dumb shitty opinions.

1220
00:59:32,929 --> 00:59:33,250
Okay.

1221
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,420
What do you think was the last triple a game?

1222
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,900
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

1223
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:46,980
Exploded him.

1224
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:55,440
What was the last triple a major release video game that you played that you said

1225
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,760
that was actually a really cool story.

1226
00:59:57,809 --> 01:00:00,449
Like I'm, and I'm very invested in this and I'm really, I want to know

1227
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:00,849
what happens.

1228
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:05,369
Um, dude, I'm, I'm, I have such a small brain.

1229
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:08,929
I would need a list of the games I've played.

1230
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,690
It's probably God of War, right?

1231
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,690
Like, but isn't God of War the same thing?

1232
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,969
Like, Oh, where's my boy?

1233
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,349
Yes, it is.

1234
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,860
Disco Elysium.

1235
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,699
Yeah, it's not your play.

1236
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:29,179
You played Disco Elysium?

1237
01:00:29,219 --> 01:00:30,460
No, I heard it's good.

1238
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,860
You, you're going to keep complaining.

1239
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,780
You know, games that don't have good stories.

1240
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,619
I'm just going to skip all the ones with good stories.

1241
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,349
But it was okay.

1242
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:45,099
God of War was cool though.

1243
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,780
It was, it was cool.

1244
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,500
I think we just hate zombie games.

1245
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:52,969
I, what are you talking about?

1246
01:00:52,969 --> 01:00:54,769
I said this game has been fun.

1247
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,489
No, I'm talking about story, story, story, story.

1248
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,329
I said story.

1249
01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:00,849
Zombies, zombies are like who gives a shit.

1250
01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:04,090
Just beat them up, put as many on screen as you possibly can.

1251
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,809
And that's why I'm saying dying late one was better because they put more

1252
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:09,090
zombies on my screen and that's all I care about.

1253
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:23,170
What, what, okay, is it, you mentioned the last of us.

1254
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:26,769
Isn't the last of us considered like really, really good gameplay?

1255
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:28,409
Like it's a very good game.

1256
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:29,849
I've never played any of them.

1257
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:31,809
I just assumed that comment would rile someone up.

1258
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,210
Not the gameplay is not good.

1259
01:01:37,449 --> 01:01:48,409
Oh, the last of us is only well-regarded for the story.

1260
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,800
All I know is that occasionally people complain that there's like women in

1261
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,119
the last of us or some shit.

1262
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,949
Was Bioshock Infinite really good?

1263
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,670
I like feel like enough time's gone by.

1264
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:04,469
I liked that game.

1265
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,670
Does that make me like a weird, like normie or something?

1266
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:09,929
Wait, that Bioshock Infinite was what?

1267
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:12,900
I bought Bioshock Infinite was good.

1268
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,719
Like it was an interesting concept.

1269
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:22,500
Like the Bioshock series might be the last time that I was like, holy shit,

1270
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,739
that was fucking actually phenomenal.

1271
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:24,500
Like the story.

1272
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,860
I was shocked one, like Bioshock Infinite.

1273
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:28,900
I feel like it was like phenomenal.

1274
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:31,579
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

1275
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,829
Flare, save that guy.

1276
01:02:34,389 --> 01:02:34,909
Save that guy.

1277
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,679
Oh fuck, save me instead.

1278
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,559
What about Red Dead?

1279
01:02:46,989 --> 01:02:49,230
Red Dead was, okay.

1280
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:49,510
Yep.

1281
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,750
Red Dead Redemption 2 was, I liked what they did in Red Dead 2.

1282
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,550
This is what I mean.

1283
01:02:56,510 --> 01:03:00,949
When we can sit here and be reminded of games, it's easy to forget how many good

1284
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:03,829
things there are and you just sit around and like, just, I don't even remember.

1285
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:05,309
And then someone will go, what about this game?

1286
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:06,030
You go, oh yeah.

1287
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:06,670
And what about this?

1288
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,269
Oh yeah.

1289
01:03:07,269 --> 01:03:07,789
What about this?

1290
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:08,550
Yeah, that was good too.

1291
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:16,469
Just laser focused on like the one zombie apocalypse genre and forgetting every

1292
01:03:16,469 --> 01:03:18,389
other phenomenal game that's come out.

1293
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:19,829
Yeah.

1294
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:22,389
Every game is a zombie game and I don't like it.

1295
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,360
I fucking swear to God, you have to save me.

1296
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,679
I'm just jumping around and dying.

1297
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,820
Negativity for the sake of negativity.

1298
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,099
Well, I don't know, but I, this game's not bad.

1299
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:46,780
It's like, it's, this is fun.

1300
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:52,579
You to be in a discord call with somebody that's like one of your, I mean, a friend

1301
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,179
of yours, I wouldn't call them a good friend.

1302
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:55,980
I'd call them like a pretty decent friend.

1303
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,619
Like, you know, like an acquaintance level up.

1304
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:00,420
Like I would say, like then you could like a hang out with that person.

1305
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,340
Hang out, kill some zombies, just talk and hang out.

1306
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,179
It's just a fun time.

1307
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,960
Like this is that, is there's nothing wrong with that.

1308
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,530
We're just hopping around.

1309
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:23,329
I'm the markers over here.

1310
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:28,219
Oh, you just, this is your coworker.

1311
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:36,429
And he said, just fucking go outside, dude.

1312
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,380
That's what I'm saying.

1313
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:42,420
Video games.

1314
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,619
Have you guys tried in real life sports games?

1315
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:54,739
No, but forget about zombies.

1316
01:04:55,539 --> 01:05:00,179
I played Far Cry four, Far Cry five, Far Cry six, whatever.

1317
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,150
I feel like I'm in that game right now.

1318
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,389
I feel like I'm in the game now and there's no cars.

1319
01:05:06,429 --> 01:05:07,619
There's doors right here.

1320
01:05:08,179 --> 01:05:09,219
You are in the game right now.

1321
01:05:09,219 --> 01:05:16,159
You're dying like one that was like it was a good game and then Ubisoft

1322
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:19,159
in between dying like one and two released about 50 of the same game.

1323
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:20,800
And they're like, wow, that model is successful.

1324
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,599
Let's do that.

1325
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:22,239
And then they did it.

1326
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:23,639
Oh, of course, I'm sure.

1327
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:26,460
I don't know something.

1328
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,500
All right, we have to move on because I think we've been talking about

1329
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,300
like the video game podcast routine.

1330
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,940
Dying light zombie games are boring since like an hour and 12 minutes ago.

1331
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:39,460
Yes. Like, ask me a stupid question about McDonald's.

1332
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:40,380
All right. All right. All right.

1333
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:44,099
So, dude, what's your order at Wendy's, would you say?

1334
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:47,820
I think mine is chicken nuggets and Asiago ranch.

1335
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:54,769
Asiago cheese.

1336
01:05:54,769 --> 01:05:56,409
You have unused inhibitors.

1337
01:05:56,409 --> 01:05:58,329
I do. Oh, shit, I do.

1338
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,340
Oh, I got something for you.

1339
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:11,739
Why is Asiago cheese only ever sprinkled on baked bread?

1340
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,949
How come it's never on anything else?

1341
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:16,949
It's only like, oh, and by the way, the bread, it's got Asiago cheese

1342
01:06:16,949 --> 01:06:18,710
baked on top of it.

1343
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:19,949
Well, I want to eat it normally.

1344
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:21,510
Why the fuck do they always do that?

1345
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,869
I'm not a cheese expert.

1346
01:06:22,869 --> 01:06:24,630
I I don't know.

1347
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:25,590
It tastes so good.

1348
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:28,389
Why is it only like the little little like bacon bits

1349
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,670
that are sprinkled on the edge of like a pizza crust?

1350
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,909
My chat says it is. He's narrow minded.

1351
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:36,119
Oh, OK.

1352
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:40,989
Oops. I got to plant the bombs over here.

1353
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:47,070
That's actually kind of cool looking.

1354
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,349
This is like once the last time you really sat down and had a triple A sandwich

1355
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:54,639
that didn't just put Asiago on it.

1356
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:57,159
Yeah, like these double A sandwich developers,

1357
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:00,579
they I think they're doing a much better job.

1358
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:03,099
Yeah. Every time I've had an indie sandwich and come away

1359
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:05,739
with like a really unique experience, I've always remembered it more

1360
01:07:05,739 --> 01:07:07,860
and always wanted more.

1361
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:10,980
I mean, like the triple A sandwich devs putting like a slice of avocado

1362
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,019
on everything, I mean, like I'm kind of getting sick of that.

1363
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:14,420
The avocado shit.

1364
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,940
And these guys are level six.

1365
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:25,670
Are they? Oh, no.

1366
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,989
He almost one shot me.

1367
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:30,469
I swear to God, I wouldn't be surprised if like a meatball sub had avocado.

1368
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:43,440
It's always like an extra dollar.

1369
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,840
Yep, we have avocado as an extra dollar 50.

1370
01:07:48,610 --> 01:08:07,329
Oh, what does this do?

1371
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:10,090
He's not even being ironic anymore.

1372
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:13,730
And he's a triple A sandwich devs.

1373
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:18,550
I love. Oh, my God.

1374
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:23,189
You guys are kicking our ass.

1375
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:25,430
We're going to use the environment to our advantage, bro.

1376
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:29,029
There's all this swamp water they conveniently live by.

1377
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,909
I love avocado.

1378
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:34,789
Avocado is delicious.

1379
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:38,630
I just I just don't want it on like number one through four

1380
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:49,649
out of the 10 things on the menu.

1381
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:53,649
We got to blow this up.

1382
01:08:53,649 --> 01:09:00,729
Do you want to do it? Help me.

1383
01:09:00,729 --> 01:09:03,210
I wonder if these guys drop anything sick.

1384
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:08,760
Yeah, I bet their loot tables are insane.

1385
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,119
You missed.

1386
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:13,130
I didn't. He just took it

1387
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:14,489
like that game with a great story.

1388
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:15,609
Boy, take it.

1389
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:16,689
Whoa.

1390
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:26,060
Avocados, avocado and everything.

1391
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:29,760
God, can you imagine put like millennials avocado?

1392
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,880
Thanks for the points. I got Internet points.

1393
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,619
I like avocados. So do I.

1394
01:09:35,619 --> 01:09:37,340
They're delicious. They have a ton of good fats.

1395
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,140
They're really good for you.

1396
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,100
And like, sure, put it on a bunch of stuff because you get if you put

1397
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:44,380
avocado like smear on like a ham sandwich

1398
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,659
and like the motherfucker doesn't even know it's on there.

1399
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:48,380
That's just healthy. And they're going to feel better.

1400
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,819
They gave up vitamins.

1401
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:55,810
Why am I complaining about this? Who cares?

1402
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:59,460
They go bad kind of quickly, though.

1403
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,210
But I think that just might be their

1404
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:07,600
replying to obsolescence now.

1405
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,050
What's your favorite condiment on a sandwich?

1406
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:13,699
It'd be pretty much anything.

1407
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:16,300
Like when I say condiment, what's your favorite addition to a sandwich?

1408
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:19,220
We talk like we're talking.

1409
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,739
What kind of sandwich?

1410
01:10:20,739 --> 01:10:25,470
Just in general, like like a cold cut.

1411
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:31,770
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

1412
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,760
You lost me like 6000 viewers, by the way.

1413
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,359
Thanks a lot. Did I?

1414
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:39,800
Yeah, because I didn't instantly answer your fucking stupid

1415
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,119
question sandwich question.

1416
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:43,520
No, you started talking like video game politics.

1417
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,039
And you started that whole conversation.

1418
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:46,880
I was like, I'm surprised.

1419
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,760
Germa's going here. Germa's usually not this negative.

1420
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,880
This is usually me. This is why I have no viewers.

1421
01:10:53,569 --> 01:10:58,619
And then you just kept going.

1422
01:10:58,619 --> 01:11:00,699
But honestly, God, what do you minds?

1423
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:03,720
Well, I want to hear yours first.

1424
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,829
Um, I don't know what it is.

1425
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,710
I don't know what the full combo is.

1426
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:14,590
But as a as a a young lad who grew up in New Jersey,

1427
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:16,630
I got to say Jersey Mike's the like

1428
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:20,770
there's some like classic Jersey put this on a cold sub.

1429
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:22,609
That is like, yeah, that's Jersey.

1430
01:11:22,609 --> 01:11:27,050
I'm going to go down the shore and say weird things to other people at the shore.

1431
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,640
Oh, are you talking about oregano Mike's?

1432
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,319
Yeah, oregano Mike's oregano Mike's.

1433
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:34,359
OK, well, it's not it's not like any one thing.

1434
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:41,779
It's like there's this salt and vinegar and oregano Mike's and and something else.

1435
01:11:41,779 --> 01:11:44,859
Last few times I ordered Jersey Mike's.

1436
01:11:44,859 --> 01:11:55,460
It was like an oregano sandwich.

1437
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,140
So you like oregano?

1438
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:59,939
I mean, oregano is pretty good.

1439
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:01,340
You didn't say a condiment.

1440
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:03,060
You just said, I like Jersey Mike's.

1441
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,619
No, it's the thing that because that's what people would understand now.

1442
01:12:06,619 --> 01:12:08,939
Growing up in New Jersey, there was this place I lived.

1443
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:09,979
It was called Big Wally's.

1444
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:11,539
It was a local local.

1445
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:14,140
All right. You know, you know, for local business.

1446
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:15,539
And they put like the same shit on it.

1447
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:17,180
So apparently it's like a New Jersey thing.

1448
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:20,020
And I didn't know until like they called their place Jersey Mike's.

1449
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,460
I was like, you know what? I did have these back in Jersey.

1450
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,739
OK, but where it all began.

1451
01:12:24,739 --> 01:12:27,220
What's on it?

1452
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:30,689
It's like salt and vinegar.

1453
01:12:30,689 --> 01:12:34,090
And what the fuck is this?

1454
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:35,689
What is the mixture?

1455
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:37,289
I don't know. That was my question.

1456
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:39,529
My question was, what do you like on a sandwich?

1457
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:41,970
And you said, I like this sandwich place.

1458
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,850
No, I'm not saying I like this sandwich place.

1459
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:45,890
I'm saying Jersey Mike's.

1460
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:50,170
They typically put that mixture of Jersey things on their Jersey sandwiches.

1461
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:56,710
OK, but I never really knew exactly what it was.

1462
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,649
OK, hold on. He's got me going to the menu.

1463
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:05,859
I literally typed German into my like food delivery menu.

1464
01:13:05,859 --> 01:13:07,140
No, you don't want to order the German.

1465
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,340
Trust me, you'll puke.

1466
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,579
It's like it's like four tablespoons of mayonnaise, turkey, lettuce

1467
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:14,100
and like a bunch of honey mustard.

1468
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,199
You'd probably throw up if you ate it.

1469
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:22,140
Olive oil blend, red wine, vinegar, oregano salt.

1470
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I think that's like the classic.

1471
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,479
We're going to drench this shit in some sort of like sewage water.

1472
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,720
But it's going to taste good.

1473
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,800
I'm a big fan of mayo on turkey sandwiches.

1474
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,600
And now, obviously, when I said three tablespoons, that was a joke.

1475
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:41,350
OK. Oh, I changed my answer.

1476
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:44,819
You did. Yeah, I changed it.

1477
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:49,760
Lettuce, mayo, turkey and cheddar is like

1478
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,520
it's probably my all time favorite, just cold cut sandwich.

1479
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:57,529
Turkey and mayo is in general just like a like a Thanksgiving sandwich to turkey

1480
01:13:57,529 --> 01:14:01,130
cranberry, like stuffing thick cut turkey.

1481
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:02,090
Oh, my God.

1482
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,850
Turkey mayonnaise is unfucking believable.

1483
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,689
It's the best combination.

1484
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:07,770
Some Chipotle aioli.

1485
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:10,770
Sure. I think the whole thing blew up Chipotle.

1486
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,010
What? Chipotle aioli.

1487
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:15,010
I don't know. I thought you said Chipotle bologna.

1488
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:17,369
And I was like, wait, that's actually kind of sounds kind of good.

1489
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:18,649
Wait, am I wrong? Am I?

1490
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:20,250
Is my is my brain melting?

1491
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,850
I haven't I haven't been talking to German for too long.

1492
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:25,140
Why? What happened?

1493
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:30,890
Is that what it's called?

1494
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,489
Yeah, I don't know.

1495
01:14:32,489 --> 01:14:37,640
I'm lost. We have to.

1496
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,659
I think I think you got to talk to him.

1497
01:14:41,659 --> 01:14:42,619
I just I did.

1498
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:45,420
I did you and I did the mission and then I climbed on the roof.

1499
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:50,260
People hate Mayo because they're just like, oh, it's oh, you like Mayo.

1500
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,859
It's all gross.

1501
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:55,899
You know that Mayo is like a thick, creamy white substance.

1502
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1503
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:06,430
Please kind of bland.

1504
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:11,899
That's why I'm saying that's why I'm saying aioli out here.

1505
01:15:11,899 --> 01:15:13,380
That's just aioli.

1506
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,619
Do you know what? Yeah, I was going to say aioli is mayonnaise.

1507
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,579
Yeah, but it's like flavored with something.

1508
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,460
It's like mayonnaise is the water.

1509
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,539
The creamy, gross water of sandwiches.

1510
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:27,619
No, but it Mayo pulls out a lot of flavors.

1511
01:15:27,619 --> 01:15:29,220
That's why it's in a ton of aiolis.

1512
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,539
It's why it's the base of a ton of shit.

1513
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:32,779
Yeah, but it's it's a base.

1514
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:36,859
It's not like with Mayo and turkey and cranberry sauce mixed together.

1515
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:39,220
It makes an incredible combination.

1516
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:44,159
OK, but is it the cranberry sauce or the Mayo that you're

1517
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,199
like really wooed by here?

1518
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:50,640
It's both combined.

1519
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,239
I like cranberry sauce, but if it's like a cranberry Mayo,

1520
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:57,010
it's just it's 10 times better.

1521
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,130
Oh, we're being timed.

1522
01:15:58,130 --> 01:15:59,250
Yes, we are.

1523
01:16:01,829 --> 01:16:05,380
Oh, this thing.

1524
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,460
What the fuck are you talking about?

1525
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,289
Was I not supposed to do that?

1526
01:16:09,289 --> 01:16:11,090
On my screen, you're holding onto nothing.

1527
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:13,390
You're just floating.

1528
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:15,510
How long am I supposed to hold this for?

1529
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,630
A while.

1530
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:19,390
Oh, I'm I'm going to run out of here.

1531
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,310
I'm going to run out of grip.

1532
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,350
I'm going to run out of grip.

1533
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:28,170
Hold on. Oh, oh, what?

1534
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,819
Oh, shit.

1535
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,210
You just went by the right side.

1536
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:50,810
You were right in my peripheral.

1537
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:52,579
Are you OK?

1538
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:54,260
Did you make it? Oh, God.

1539
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,380
I went to go get you and it just it took me up again.

1540
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,060
I'm sure I can do this in 30 seconds.

1541
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:03,029
How come I this is going to explode?

1542
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:06,300
I don't know.

1543
01:17:08,619 --> 01:17:11,949
Why won't anyone tell us what's going on?

1544
01:17:11,949 --> 01:17:21,630
How come I can't just force kill?

1545
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:28,619
Oh, no, Tony Soprano is about to walk over here with a propane tank.

1546
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:32,460
He's going to be setting up his grill and see, he's going to be pissed

1547
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,699
that it doesn't work and he's going to punch it.

1548
01:17:34,699 --> 01:17:37,119
You know, shows over. OK.

1549
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,369
This is important, dude.

1550
01:17:39,369 --> 01:17:42,510
Two minutes and 30 seconds.

1551
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:47,649
Your street cred on the line.

1552
01:17:47,649 --> 01:17:50,909
You're a parkour master.

1553
01:17:50,909 --> 01:17:52,670
And we said Sopranos reference.

1554
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,420
You may have missed the last stream.

1555
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,619
Yeah, that's all we talk about now.

1556
01:17:56,619 --> 01:17:57,859
We're huge Sopranos fans.

1557
01:17:57,859 --> 01:17:59,739
We love Jersey Mike because it's from Jersey.

1558
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:03,979
We love everything about just sandwiches and like TV show references.

1559
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:07,199
It's the only thing.

1560
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:11,170
Yeah. What the fuck is what do you go from here?

1561
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,569
I think you need to jump to the other.

1562
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:15,369
Yeah, there you go. OK.

1563
01:18:15,369 --> 01:18:24,220
They do it here for long. This is really thin from here.

1564
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,220
I don't know.

1565
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:32,279
Yeah. Wait, we have to wait for this to OK.

1566
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:42,329
I got it. Oh, fuck.

1567
01:18:42,329 --> 01:18:44,569
OK. Now from here, it's this way.

1568
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:59,420
Oh, wait.

1569
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:18,689
You fall, you fell, didn't you?

1570
01:19:18,689 --> 01:19:20,449
You did. I'm going to make it up.

1571
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:27,670
It's up to you. I'll do it.

1572
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:34,140
Thank God I made it.

1573
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,420
Do you need me to be there to plant it?

1574
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,859
No. OK. OK.

1575
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:42,119
I was going to say that would be bad.

1576
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:45,859
Yeah, this is why I play games with you.

1577
01:19:45,859 --> 01:19:51,819
You're so good at them.

1578
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:54,779
That's what I did. But you died down here.

1579
01:19:54,779 --> 01:20:04,899
I didn't die. I landed in the water.

1580
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:06,739
You know what I mean? That was like three hundred

1581
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:08,739
and forty five thousand dollars to do that.

1582
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:11,020
Yeah. Why did we have only two minutes to blow it up?

1583
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,689
Was the C4 already timed?

1584
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:16,449
Who maybe like what did this guy have to say?

1585
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:17,409
Why did you skip?

1586
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:24,920
That costs probably so much to have money to do that.

1587
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:30,250
Oh, my God, dude.

1588
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:34,699
Is my phone Uber eats on my phone.

1589
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:37,260
Jersey Mike subs on your mind.

1590
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,300
You're one tap away.

1591
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:42,579
Shut the fuck up.

1592
01:20:42,579 --> 01:20:43,659
Well, didn't they know I'm here?

1593
01:20:43,659 --> 01:20:45,859
Weren't you typing it into that app?

1594
01:20:45,859 --> 01:20:48,930
I was. So now they're trying to get me.

1595
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:51,489
I totally like my brain forgot that I was already doing it.

1596
01:20:51,489 --> 01:20:53,289
And I thought that they tapped into my

1597
01:20:53,289 --> 01:20:55,850
because I'm I'm already under surveillance for that other thing.

1598
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,609
But this is this is not like, oh, no.

1599
01:20:57,609 --> 01:20:58,770
The iPhone's listening to me.

1600
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,130
This is you typed in Jersey Mike's into that app.

1601
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,729
Yeah. They're recommending it.

1602
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:04,529
Yes. But now it's targeted ads.

1603
01:21:04,529 --> 01:21:07,770
And we don't like those because we don't want anything to be advertised.

1604
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:14,949
I don't want people listening to me.

1605
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:22,310
I do. That's why I'm streaming.

1606
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,189
You did. I don't know if you saw that one time

1607
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:32,039
I was browsing YouTube and I got an ad for this place

1608
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:34,399
and it was just popped up a banner ad.

1609
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:37,119
It's like, I don't know, five or six videos in.

1610
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:44,000
And this thing said, oh, luxury apartments starting at twenty one thousand dollars.

1611
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,760
And that I think that was a month.

1612
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,119
I was sitting there just freaking out

1613
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,250
because everybody was saying that was a targeted ad.

1614
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:58,199
But that would be fucking crazy.

1615
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:01,439
You're not you're not paying twenty one thousand dollars a month for your apartment.

1616
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:06,600
Oh, wait, what do we do?

1617
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,289
Do we lie to Alberto and not show up on time?

1618
01:22:10,289 --> 01:22:12,619
Yeah, let's get to the center.

1619
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:14,899
OK, I'll show you the way.

1620
01:22:14,899 --> 01:22:21,010
I don't remember what I said to him, so it's like I never did.

1621
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:27,859
Twenty thousand dollars a month in like a home cost is what is that a year?

1622
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:32,460
But to was it to turn like fifty thousand dollars a year?

1623
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,640
A lot of a lot of money.

1624
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,560
That's like buying a house every year.

1625
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,840
What the fuck, man?

1626
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:47,090
I'm done matter.

1627
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:53,090
You help me. That's buying a house.

1628
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:58,869
That's almost buying a house every single year of your life.

1629
01:22:58,869 --> 01:23:03,199
But such a great neighborhood.

1630
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:09,289
I accidentally did cocaine.

1631
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:13,609
I just imagine you put a line on your desk

1632
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:17,890
and you like sneeze and you smash your head as hard as you can onto the desk

1633
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:20,449
and like hurt your head and.

1634
01:23:20,449 --> 01:23:26,180
Oh, fuck, I didn't mean to do that.

1635
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:36,199
No, no, I feel weird.

1636
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:46,079
Yep. Yep.

1637
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:51,609
Yeah, it's not dead air.

1638
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:53,810
Oh, come on dead.

1639
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:56,850
It's not dead air. It's been five seconds.

1640
01:23:56,850 --> 01:24:01,739
You can't just talk for an infinite amount of time forever.

1641
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:04,859
We need time for our brains to think about something like it.

1642
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:09,500
We can't just speak forever, constantly like we need ten seconds sometimes

1643
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,220
to be like, OK, this is the next sentence I'm going to say.

1644
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:20,390
I think I'm going to say that now stalling.

1645
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,710
I actually might be stupid.

1646
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:24,270
It's starting to become clear.

1647
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:26,590
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1648
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:31,460
Why can I not grab this? But you can.

1649
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,779
Oh, what?

1650
01:24:32,779 --> 01:24:36,689
On my screen, you jumped and grab that.

1651
01:24:36,689 --> 01:24:38,130
I did grab something.

1652
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:47,579
I'm buying some medicine. 72 damage.

1653
01:24:47,579 --> 01:24:54,460
It's insane. Yeah, I need some medicine from this guy.

1654
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,300
He's selling some drugs.

1655
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:03,739
I want this helmet and I want these gloves to also booster.

1656
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:06,750
You're going to want that muscle booster.

1657
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,220
Unity, endurance.

1658
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,979
I want health.

1659
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:23,869
This guy, honey.

1660
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:26,550
I haven't crafted anything since the tutorial.

1661
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:36,260
What kind of a customer feels like kind of kind of be feeling like

1662
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:43,170
this is totally my face when oh, yeah, I can craft 13 medicines.

1663
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:47,060
And you've been saying you've been saying the whole time

1664
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:51,090
how much you don't have health or healing.

1665
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:54,590
You know, you have been saying that.

1666
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:57,350
Yeah, it's been a problem.

1667
01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:04,399
Well, just get on it.

1668
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:07,800
How are streamers simultaneously supposed to be the ones who talk

1669
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,159
to people endlessly without good air, but also are always in their chair

1670
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:15,170
so they never leave and have life experience?

1671
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,609
Are you running out of stuff to talk about?

1672
01:26:16,609 --> 01:26:20,609
Like, have we ran out of stuff to talk about?

1673
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:22,170
I mean, it's been a long time since we've started.

1674
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:26,310
I mean, you like the last episode of Game of Thrones.

1675
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:29,819
Why are you giving me all your health packs?

1676
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:31,640
You were hurt.

1677
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,439
Yeah, but I've helped.

1678
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:34,449
I'm a support.

1679
01:26:34,449 --> 01:26:36,689
Oh, OK.

1680
01:26:36,689 --> 01:26:39,020
What's this one do for damage?

1681
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:39,859
I think 73 now.

1682
01:26:39,859 --> 01:26:45,250
That's way better.

1683
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:48,810
All right, so now we have to go this way.

1684
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,520
Hey, what's up with the Olympics?

1685
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,039
I don't I didn't even know they were on.

1686
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:54,680
Exactly.

1687
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,199
They're doing the Olympics right now.

1688
01:26:56,199 --> 01:27:00,260
And then I brought that up and Ashley's mom was like, you're crazy

1689
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:04,529
because they had the Olympics during the summer.

1690
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:05,130
Yeah.

1691
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:07,609
The winner and the but they're doing the Winter Olympics now.

1692
01:27:07,609 --> 01:27:10,010
But usually they're doing they usually there's a two year gap, right?

1693
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:13,619
I'm not crazy.

1694
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:15,699
It's been two years since the Summer Olympics.

1695
01:27:15,699 --> 01:27:18,739
No, it hasn't, because I remember watching the Summer Olympics

1696
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:22,619
while I was at a gamer's house and that was in August ish.

1697
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:24,170
That was in July.

1698
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,170
Oh, no, no. Yeah, that's because of covid.

1699
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:28,050
They delayed it because of that.

1700
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:30,130
You don't know what covid-19 is.

1701
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:31,250
Yes, you do.

1702
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:31,770
Stop it.

1703
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:36,329
Stop faking for content because we have no more life experience to talk about.

1704
01:27:36,329 --> 01:27:38,000
What is that?

1705
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,520
All right.

1706
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:45,890
I want to grab this and go down.

1707
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:48,010
And if we stop doing like a weird Looney Tunes,

1708
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:50,050
a coyote way to grab this.

1709
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:53,770
So wait, because because of covid, they're doing more Olympics.

1710
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:56,609
The Olympics and usually delayed.

1711
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:57,090
Yeah.

1712
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:58,090
So they did it.

1713
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:00,890
So now they're just they're doing the winter one on schedule.

1714
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:01,890
I don't know. I have no idea.

1715
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:03,930
I'm not I don't know anything about the Olympics.

1716
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:07,050
OK, you didn't tell them to like wait a year and be like, hey,

1717
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:09,609
how about we just like chill for a bit?

1718
01:28:09,609 --> 01:28:11,409
I think that's what happened.

1719
01:28:11,409 --> 01:28:12,819
Yeah.

1720
01:28:12,819 --> 01:28:14,439
Yeah, that's what happened.

1721
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:17,270
But then how are there two Olympics in one year?

1722
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:22,199
Because they delayed the summer Olympics a year because of covid.

1723
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:24,520
So then they did the summer Olympics and then they were already

1724
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,880
scheduled to do the winter Olympics.

1725
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,960
So they're doing winter Olympics on time.

1726
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,819
Isn't there a bigger gap than that usually?

1727
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:33,460
You're throwing for content.

1728
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:36,020
I'm serious.

1729
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:41,300
I thought there's at least a two year gap minimum between summer and winter,

1730
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,659
but they cycle it.

1731
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:47,060
See, this is why we don't want to have conversations.

1732
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:49,380
This I this is what I'm not bringing up.

1733
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:54,539
This is what I'm saving everyone from.

1734
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:55,699
They push the summer back.

1735
01:28:55,699 --> 01:29:02,100
Yeah. Well, this is kind of crazy.

1736
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,979
But the dates, they don't they still don't add up to me.

1737
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:11,329
I mean, there was a delay and that's it.

1738
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:13,979
Hey, you got to run, run, run, run.

1739
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:15,100
He's coming. He's coming. He's coming.

1740
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,899
He's going to do something. Run, run.

1741
01:29:17,899 --> 01:29:29,260
He's here. I tried to warn you.

1742
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:35,180
I have never been able to do like the slide under this.

1743
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,380
Oh, there. Oh, you got to hold it.

1744
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:41,909
Will you hold C? Yeah.

1745
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:45,229
You one of those are you one of those like useless people who binds

1746
01:29:45,229 --> 01:29:47,630
crouch to see because it starts with crouching?

1747
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:49,270
What does that mean?

1748
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:50,989
It's like drinking a Gatorade.

1749
01:29:50,989 --> 01:29:58,300
You're just ready for a fight.

1750
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:03,340
A couple of zeds.

1751
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:08,640
Should we check like some of these buildings or materials?

1752
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,840
Do you need materials?

1753
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,720
Why is there a waypoint?

1754
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,399
Did you put a waypoint there?

1755
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:16,930
I might have by accident a long time ago.

1756
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:19,890
I want to get to the new zone.

1757
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:22,170
It's not going to happen.

1758
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:23,329
This has to be soon.

1759
01:30:23,329 --> 01:30:24,449
We just blew this zone up.

1760
01:30:24,449 --> 01:30:25,729
Can we please go to the objective?

1761
01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:40,159
We cheated and put a bunch of XP points in and we're not going to get there.

1762
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:50,500
We got soldiers.

1763
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,399
Break his neck, break his neck, break his neck, break his neck.

1764
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:55,880
This is what I'm talking about with the health bars, where you throw molotovs

1765
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:59,210
on people and they act like these are near them.

1766
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:08,449
So stupid.

1767
01:31:08,449 --> 01:31:09,930
That should not.

1768
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:15,579
Oh, it should not kill somebody.

1769
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:18,859
Getting hit in the head by an axe doesn't kill you.

1770
01:31:18,859 --> 01:31:23,319
But getting drop kicked WWE style does.

1771
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:25,100
Yeah.

1772
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,300
Do you not respect wrestlers?

1773
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,579
Do you think they're not putting their lives on the line every time a drop

1774
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:30,140
kick comes out?

1775
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:36,979
Triple H. You know what I'm saying?

1776
01:31:36,979 --> 01:31:39,739
Random mission here.

1777
01:31:39,739 --> 01:31:42,859
No, we're going to the main quest.

1778
01:31:42,859 --> 01:31:46,439
I don't want to hear anything from you.

1779
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:51,060
You so badly want to get us to the other island, but I don't think it's going to happen, man.

1780
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:51,939
I don't think so.

1781
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:55,180
How are we not right there when this island just got blown up?

1782
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,189
All the loose ends are dealt with.

1783
01:31:57,189 --> 01:32:00,460
Every person has betrayed us.

1784
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:06,420
We've killed everyone.

1785
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,789
I need a player here.

1786
01:32:07,789 --> 01:32:18,420
Oh, I'm right there.

1787
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,579
Hack on betrayed us.

1788
01:32:19,579 --> 01:32:20,939
You'll find it here.

1789
01:32:20,939 --> 01:32:22,060
Let's go.

1790
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:22,819
See, we're going.

1791
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:23,699
We still have some coffee left.

1792
01:32:23,699 --> 01:32:25,739
That's kind of Pog.

1793
01:32:25,739 --> 01:32:29,010
That's kind of Pog, dude.

1794
01:32:31,149 --> 01:32:33,470
I was just about to say this guy's going to die in this scene.

1795
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,149
I should have said it. What a stupid idiot.

1796
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:36,109
I was going to say it.

1797
01:32:36,109 --> 01:32:37,229
I promise I was.

1798
01:32:37,229 --> 01:32:38,670
Calm down. Let me see.

1799
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:39,750
Everyone's dead.

1800
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:41,789
Now we can go to the next area.

1801
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:43,590
Show me. I can't believe I didn't say it.

1802
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:44,829
It would have been perfect.

1803
01:32:44,829 --> 01:32:46,729
I'm dying my arms.

1804
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:47,970
You say you killed Lucas.

1805
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:52,699
If not for those brass knuckles, it would only be a few seconds to do the job.

1806
01:32:52,699 --> 01:32:54,300
I thought it was a better fighter.

1807
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:56,239
I think so.

1808
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:57,760
No point denying it with this one.

1809
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,600
I'm born.

1810
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,199
Well, wait, don't skip.

1811
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:01,960
Let him talk.

1812
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,760
Oh, you don't get it, kid.

1813
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,439
You like watching people in pain?

1814
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:08,159
This is the first cut, you know, like

1815
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,520
grab your attention.

1816
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,100
Is it because he kind of looks like me a little bit?

1817
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,140
Does he have black hair?

1818
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:16,739
He kind of does kind of look like you.

1819
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:17,899
He does have black hair.

1820
01:33:17,899 --> 01:33:19,340
So he's like he does look like me.

1821
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:22,260
He's got like scars all across his face and he's like 40 years old.

1822
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,739
Kind of looks like me.

1823
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:30,819
This guy was double crossing us.

1824
01:33:30,819 --> 01:33:32,119
Yeah.

1825
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:42,989
We have to make a choice.

1826
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:44,909
Leave him to die or help him.

1827
01:33:44,909 --> 01:33:46,270
He did betray us.

1828
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:47,350
He did. He did.

1829
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:50,069
But he did give us our wristwatch.

1830
01:33:50,069 --> 01:33:52,670
And he put us through that long fucking tutorial.

1831
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:54,189
He did make us do a tutorial.

1832
01:33:54,189 --> 01:33:57,260
You're right. He is the reason why the tutorial happened.

1833
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:00,880
But if it wouldn't, if it wasn't going to be Hakan, it would have been somebody else.

1834
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:01,840
I'm going to let him die.

1835
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,760
I'm going to help him.

1836
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,829
I heard an impasse here.

1837
01:34:07,829 --> 01:34:11,010
I should leave you to die for what you did.

1838
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:12,170
Why wouldn't you?

1839
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:16,800
I'm going to find that sniper first.

1840
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:18,680
Well, now he's guaranteed to die because.

1841
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,720
Yeah, yeah, really.

1842
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,840
You do that for me after that.

1843
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,029
We're fucking done.

1844
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:30,590
And I was bad.

1845
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:32,109
Didn't hit any major organs.

1846
01:34:32,109 --> 01:34:33,470
So I think it's OK.

1847
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:41,020
Yeah. You have to push the arrow in.

1848
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,460
No, you don't.

1849
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:45,539
Everybody pretends to know what to do in that scenario.

1850
01:34:45,539 --> 01:34:47,380
I don't think anybody really does.

1851
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:56,579
You you you force some like acid on it, right, to just dissolve the thing.

1852
01:34:56,579 --> 01:34:58,970
Are we going down the tube?

1853
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:01,210
Yeah, we'd actually get to go down.

1854
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:02,369
Let me see.

1855
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:05,260
I want to how are you going to put this tube here?

1856
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:09,800
And I can't go down this way.

1857
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,439
You can't go down the tube.

1858
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:12,880
Yes. Oh, you can. Why?

1859
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:23,380
What? Nice.

1860
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:33,489
Watch out for the chemical waste.

1861
01:35:33,489 --> 01:35:35,130
I got eyes, Hakan.

1862
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,060
They're shooting us with a sniper rifle, bow and arrow.

1863
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:42,100
All right. Yeah.

1864
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,090
Did the arrow stick out of you?

1865
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:49,560
No. Oh, I was going to say, let's sit here and just heal and get like a thousand arrows in us.

1866
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,119
You take that guy over here.

1867
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:55,199
How? No, we don't have we don't have range weapons or guns.

1868
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,039
I just threw an explosive coin.

1869
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:01,029
Aiden, you all right?

1870
01:36:01,029 --> 01:36:03,539
Got him with the grenade.

1871
01:36:03,539 --> 01:36:06,180
Did you? I think so.

1872
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:14,239
What the? Wait, this is not how shoots and ladders works.

1873
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,659
Hold on. I see him, Aiden.

1874
01:36:16,659 --> 01:36:19,479
Sticking to the roof. How do I get up there?

1875
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:20,880
He's running.

1876
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:29,989
Uh, it's going to hurt me.

1877
01:36:29,989 --> 01:36:32,340
Make sure you use your healing kit.

1878
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,560
I mean, I have mushrooms.

1879
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:39,560
One second until I'm dead.

1880
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,060
OK. Remember, the floor is lava, dude.

1881
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,890
That makes sense.

1882
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:51,819
Now we got to go. Oh, we got to get up this way.

1883
01:36:51,819 --> 01:36:54,020
We do. We're not going to let this guy get away with shooting Hakan,

1884
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:58,000
the guy who betrayed us that we're going to save.

1885
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,689
This is I mean, who makes it like this?

1886
01:37:02,689 --> 01:37:06,420
Like, why don't you make an elevator?

1887
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:16,800
They took the time to, like, outline it in yellow and all that.

1888
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,100
Hold on. I'm picking flowers.

1889
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:23,260
I mean, this is really important, but.

1890
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:26,100
Actually, kind of is because we need help.

1891
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:32,529
I don't see. I don't.

1892
01:37:32,529 --> 01:37:37,340
What? Don't question it.

1893
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:40,100
You even need to grab onto that.

1894
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,300
Yeah, you do. Maybe. Yeah, maybe.

1895
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:56,439
All right, let's go get that sniper.

1896
01:37:56,439 --> 01:37:58,279
Why wouldn't you just shoot us while we're climbing up

1897
01:37:58,279 --> 01:37:59,640
when we're really vulnerable?

1898
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,119
Because he's using a bow and arrow to snipe people.

1899
01:38:02,119 --> 01:38:06,399
Oh, it's very challenging.

1900
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:10,960
And he doesn't know we're here because we've been very stealthy.

1901
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,880
Oh, shit. Now we.

1902
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:21,579
Every character in this game has betrayed us.

1903
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:26,100
Literally, every NPC introduced is our enemy.

1904
01:38:29,229 --> 01:38:30,909
Everybody's an enemy.

1905
01:38:30,909 --> 01:38:37,850
Oh, you got to pick your friends better.

1906
01:38:38,859 --> 01:38:41,369
OK, now she gets a choice.

1907
01:38:41,369 --> 01:38:45,130
Leave him or help him.

1908
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:47,050
And then she decides to help us and she pulls the arrow out.

1909
01:38:49,529 --> 01:38:51,810
It's in the ground. What?

1910
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:56,579
It went through the wall.

1911
01:38:56,579 --> 01:39:01,369
She's going to smash into the wall.

1912
01:39:01,369 --> 01:39:03,449
Can you imagine if she just went wily coyote style

1913
01:39:03,449 --> 01:39:06,250
directly into the side of the building?

1914
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:08,380
Why don't they do that shit?

1915
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:12,659
Do that. Have her just mess up and smash into the wall and explode into blood.

1916
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:15,020
That would be like kind of funny.

1917
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:18,220
I feel like they'd be like, holy shit, that's crazy what just happened.

1918
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:30,619
I'm chasing after her.

1919
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:32,020
I'm going to get her. Borderlands.

1920
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:35,739
Yeah. And then after and then after it happens, you hear

1921
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:41,939
that there ain't no rest for the wicked.

1922
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:46,260
Money don't grow on trees.

1923
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:49,100
I got bills to pay. I got to do it.

1924
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,579
There ain't nothing in this life for free.

1925
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:55,949
And then that guy goes,

1926
01:39:57,270 --> 01:39:58,750
oh, stranger,

1927
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,229
the guy who was supposed to get me there.

1928
01:40:00,229 --> 01:40:03,350
You don't think that I was going to leave you on the side of the road.

1929
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:15,510
Don't hit me. I jumped on the building.

1930
01:40:20,579 --> 01:40:21,739
I'm dead.

1931
01:40:21,739 --> 01:40:23,340
How are you dead?

1932
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:26,239
The fucking immunity stuff down here.

1933
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,880
Oh, fuck. It's two seconds.

1934
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,880
You might be able to.

1935
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:30,840
Oh, no.

1936
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,239
And you're telling me this just now.

1937
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:41,210
Sorry. Oh, but most of all, I have to.

1938
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:44,779
What the fuck? I'm immune.

1939
01:40:44,779 --> 01:40:46,300
All this sludge on the floor, dude.

1940
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:51,000
We need to get out of here.

1941
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:51,920
This sludge won't let us.

1942
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,359
Oh, we're going to the next area.

1943
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:54,159
We're doing it.

1944
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,720
Oh, oh, oh.

1945
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:06,909
Here, watch this jump.

1946
01:41:06,909 --> 01:41:12,979
Watch this jump.

1947
01:41:12,979 --> 01:41:20,159
360.

1948
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:22,649
What am I watching?

1949
01:41:22,649 --> 01:41:25,289
You're watching two, two bros playing a game together,

1950
01:41:25,289 --> 01:41:26,689
having a good time and messing around.

1951
01:41:26,689 --> 01:41:29,229
We talk about all kinds of things here.

1952
01:41:29,229 --> 01:41:31,550
We talk about the state of the industry.

1953
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,670
We talk about the state of gaming.

1954
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:35,470
We talk about all kinds of fun stuff.

1955
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:40,500
We talk about McDonald's orders.

1956
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:41,859
So what's your McDonald's order?

1957
01:41:41,859 --> 01:41:45,920
Double cheeseburger, two of them.

1958
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,119
Ten piece nugget.

1959
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:52,970
You think you really need to?

1960
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:54,810
Are we actually going to the new area?

1961
01:41:54,810 --> 01:42:01,939
Yeah.

1962
01:42:01,939 --> 01:42:03,090
What just?

1963
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:08,710
I swear to God, if that hurt me, I'd be mad.

1964
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:11,140
Do we have to get up this bridge?

1965
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:12,770
I don't know.

1966
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:16,529
Looking at my map, we may have to get up to.

1967
01:42:16,529 --> 01:42:20,090
Yeah, we may have to be getting up to the top of this bridge somehow.

1968
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:26,670
I see. I see where to go.

1969
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:30,189
You got to use your wits a little bit when you're doing some hardcore parkour.

1970
01:42:31,189 --> 01:42:32,550
Yeah, I order French fries.

1971
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:34,149
That's part of the nugget meal.

1972
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:37,850
You get a 10 piece nugget meal and then two double cheeseburgers.

1973
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,479
It's pretty much it.

1974
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:42,479
What's your opinion on fries that are not sweet potato fries?

1975
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:46,500
I think sweet potato fries are disgusting.

1976
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,319
Oh, that's.

1977
01:42:49,319 --> 01:42:52,760
Well, let me because every place does them

1978
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,710
and they're always like mushy and like kind of weird and gross.

1979
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:05,770
Are you and their normal fries aren't mushy from that same place?

1980
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:06,689
No, they are.

1981
01:43:06,689 --> 01:43:13,390
But I would rather have mushy regular fries than mushy sweet potato fries.

1982
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:20,909
Sweet potato fries need to be good or I don't want them.

1983
01:43:20,909 --> 01:43:25,670
But like normal fries are so bad that you're just used to them being a little gross.

1984
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:30,069
Well, because normal fries are an applicator for some type of condiment,

1985
01:43:30,069 --> 01:43:35,189
whether that's ketchup or like a mushy normal fry, you can do ketchup.

1986
01:43:35,189 --> 01:43:38,149
You can do like mustard, mayo, cheese.

1987
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:39,189
It doesn't matter what it is.

1988
01:43:39,189 --> 01:43:42,989
Sweet potato fries, I don't that doesn't taste right with like

1989
01:43:42,989 --> 01:43:46,260
honey mustard or like ketchup or I don't like it.

1990
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:49,670
It just tastes kind of different.

1991
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:52,470
So you're faulting you there.

1992
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:57,710
Sweet potato fries for being delicious on their own without any added.

1993
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:01,069
Yeah, but that's the problem is they have to be really good for me to want to eat

1994
01:44:01,069 --> 01:44:06,010
them on their own because I don't dip like sweet potato fries and ketchup mushy

1995
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:10,810
regular shitty fries taste good because you put them into like ketchup or mustard

1996
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:13,630
or whatever, anything.

1997
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:21,220
I like sweet potato fries if they're good on their own.

1998
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,420
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

1999
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:27,130
I'm getting too upset.

2000
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:27,729
The G.R.E.

2001
01:44:27,729 --> 01:44:30,729
tunnel is like a dangerous thing, like in the tunnels.

2002
01:44:30,729 --> 01:44:31,970
All the zombies are in the tunnels.

2003
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:40,189
This is like real dangerous.

2004
01:44:40,189 --> 01:44:43,060
It's level six.

2005
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:46,300
Not anymore.

2006
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:47,659
Talking about sweet potato fries.

2007
01:44:47,659 --> 01:44:48,380
No, they're good.

2008
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:53,090
I mean, I like sweet potatoes, but they have to be good on their own.

2009
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:54,050
All right. I don't really want.

2010
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:54,810
Yeah. Yeah.

2011
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:59,130
You don't like sweet potato fries because bad sweet potato fries are bad

2012
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:02,130
and can't be fixed with ketchup or mustard.

2013
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,329
They can't be fixed.

2014
01:45:03,329 --> 01:45:04,609
Yes.

2015
01:45:04,609 --> 01:45:06,729
Why don't you just get good sweet potato fries?

2016
01:45:06,729 --> 01:45:12,569
I don't know. How am I supposed to know that if I've never eaten there before?

2017
01:45:12,569 --> 01:45:15,550
What's the last meal you cooked?

2018
01:45:15,550 --> 01:45:17,270
Oh, tough guy.

2019
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:19,619
Oh, look, tough guy.

2020
01:45:19,619 --> 01:45:25,310
Orange chicken, an orange chicken with a vegetable stir fry.

2021
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:26,859
Tough guy.

2022
01:45:26,859 --> 01:45:31,920
OK, so like, why don't you just like make your own sweet potato fries?

2023
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:37,380
Because they kind of make your own fries is already kind of hard to do anyways.

2024
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:42,670
You need to like cut them into like the potato strips and then fry them up.

2025
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:47,310
And I know that's kind of kind of an elaborate ordeal.

2026
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:48,310
Or you can like put them in the. Oh, yeah.

2027
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:50,319
But I don't know.

2028
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:56,329
It seems like a lot of work to generate around here.

2029
01:45:56,329 --> 01:45:58,960
You have to hit the potato with a tennis racket.

2030
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:02,819
It sounds like a Wii game.

2031
01:46:02,819 --> 01:46:07,859
I just I just boil boil sweet potatoes because they're delicious and amazing

2032
01:46:07,859 --> 01:46:10,939
by themselves and they don't need to be fried and they don't need an excess condiment.

2033
01:46:10,939 --> 01:46:14,069
So you just hold on a minute.

2034
01:46:14,069 --> 01:46:15,890
Hold on a minute.

2035
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:21,590
You just recently, over the last couple of years, turned into like a healthy guy.

2036
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:23,869
Dude, wait a minute.

2037
01:46:23,869 --> 01:46:25,350
No, don't start this.

2038
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:29,579
You're a vegan potato fries and you're like healthy.

2039
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:31,100
You're going to like the gym.

2040
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:33,350
You're like working out and shit.

2041
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:38,899
Uh-huh. OK, I get it.

2042
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:48,609
Do you? Yeah, like all of a sudden, like sweet potato fries, man, they're like killer.

2043
01:46:48,609 --> 01:46:52,329
I don't think in the 10 years that we've known each other,

2044
01:46:52,329 --> 01:46:54,130
I don't think I've ever heard you say, do you?

2045
01:46:54,130 --> 01:46:55,890
Oh, man, sweet potato fries.

2046
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:59,600
Mm hmm. This is new.

2047
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,520
How many meals have we had together?

2048
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,960
At least like 30.

2049
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:08,630
We wouldn't normally talk about food for like six hours like this.

2050
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:13,649
All right. Honest to God, like we have been talking about food or like video game

2051
01:47:13,649 --> 01:47:15,689
zombies for a long time.

2052
01:47:15,689 --> 01:47:20,369
It's time to change subject.

2053
01:47:20,369 --> 01:47:23,289
Apparently, this is just like what gets you going.

2054
01:47:23,289 --> 01:47:28,090
Because you know what the big tip off was to me was when was the last time you cooked?

2055
01:47:29,739 --> 01:47:31,220
That's how I knew this was a tip off.

2056
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:35,220
Well, this was like, OK, stir is cooking and healthy meals.

2057
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:38,460
And no, you're talking about sweet potato fries being bad,

2058
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:42,060
because when they're delivered, they're all soggy and you don't know if they're good or not.

2059
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:43,920
I didn't say to order.

2060
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,920
The only way they're going to be soggy is the delivery package.

2061
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,119
No. Oh, he fucked it up.

2062
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:54,699
I'll get it first try.

2063
01:47:54,699 --> 01:47:58,420
Excuse me, sir.

2064
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:03,180
But an emotional state right now.

2065
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:04,500
OK, well, here we go.

2066
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,199
Are you ready?

2067
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:11,489
What was the last meal that you cooked at home?

2068
01:48:11,489 --> 01:48:17,840
Tell me.

2069
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,920
Really?

2070
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,920
It was. What else was on it?

2071
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,960
I know I had eggs this morning.

2072
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,279
Eggs. Nice, healthy eggs.

2073
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:30,569
Wait, do you eat the yolk?

2074
01:48:30,569 --> 01:48:34,569
Yeah, I just I put like a bunch of eggs in the pan with green peppers and cheese.

2075
01:48:34,569 --> 01:48:37,970
And I was going to say, like some slices of ham.

2076
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:43,449
If you were removing the yolks and having egg whites and sweet potato, like I would,

2077
01:48:43,489 --> 01:48:47,399
you would automatically I would win.

2078
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:48,520
Well, how do you win?

2079
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:51,079
How is like me being healthy, you winning?

2080
01:48:51,079 --> 01:48:54,000
No, because like if you're taking the yolks out, that's what I was looking for.

2081
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,739
But you're not doing that. OK.

2082
01:48:57,739 --> 01:49:01,310
Yeah, Ashley, my wife, she eats egg whites.

2083
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:02,550
Got a problem?

2084
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:06,319
No, I don't. I've got a problem with you.

2085
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:08,890
Why?

2086
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:09,770
Yolk is the best part.

2087
01:49:09,770 --> 01:49:17,060
Yolk is where all the vitamins are.

2088
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:25,380
That don't eat the egg yolk is like propaganda.

2089
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:28,939
But how does how do you win this conversation?

2090
01:49:28,939 --> 01:49:34,380
Because eating it because that's a really super healthy, like no cholesterol

2091
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:37,380
and like super like, you know, superfoods and yes.

2092
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:42,270
But like how is anyone winning this discussion?

2093
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:46,529
Because I'm a gamer and all things are, you know, got to be tied back to gaming.

2094
01:49:46,529 --> 01:49:51,689
Whenever I get in a weird mood whenever you're around.

2095
01:49:51,689 --> 01:49:55,489
I have too much fun when you are in a call.

2096
01:49:55,489 --> 01:49:58,329
So we better just like not play anything together for like another year.

2097
01:49:58,329 --> 01:50:00,960
Yeah.

2098
01:50:14,619 --> 01:50:17,260
But honest to God, though, egg yolks.

2099
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:20,420
Look, this is obviously if you're trying to do low cholesterol, then egg yolks.

2100
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:23,819
But don't eggs have good cholesterol?

2101
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:25,420
Not the bad, bad one.

2102
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:28,140
Be a little bit of that. What, LD?

2103
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:31,789
OK. Hold on. They're doing this fucking Ginyu Force pose.

2104
01:50:36,279 --> 01:50:38,359
They're all mad at me. They're betraying us.

2105
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:44,380
We did missions for them, and now they want to betray us.

2106
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:48,659
So I'm so sick of hearing, oh, like cholesterol is bad for you,

2107
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:50,699
but eggs are the good cholesterol.

2108
01:50:50,699 --> 01:50:53,180
And there's a whole bunch of things like I think it's all propaganda

2109
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:55,939
where if you talk about coconuts and you look online like, are coconuts good for you?

2110
01:50:55,939 --> 01:50:59,760
Oh, it has a lot of fat, but it's like the good fat.

2111
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,840
Like, when when does the cholesterol from the eggs become good?

2112
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,840
The unsaturated fat is not.

2113
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,920
It's like a building block for everything in your whole life.

2114
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:11,479
Like like fat isn't inherently bad.

2115
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:14,680
No, it's not saying like when I get my blood tested,

2116
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:18,640
my doctors are like, oh, you're looking good, but your cholesterol is a little bit high.

2117
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:21,720
And I'm like, OK, so like, is that eggs?

2118
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,359
Is that the good cholesterol?

2119
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:26,119
Is that the bad cholesterol? Is too much cholesterol in general a bad?

2120
01:51:26,119 --> 01:51:29,020
Am I going to die soon? It's they combine it, right?

2121
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:31,270
It's a combined. So here's the thing.

2122
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:35,470
A cholesterol is you have to understand something about cholesterol.

2123
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:40,109
If your cholesterol is over, I believe, 200, which is the it's combined

2124
01:51:40,109 --> 01:51:42,550
with your HDL and LDL, right?

2125
01:51:42,989 --> 01:51:45,590
Your HDMI, your HDMI is too high.

2126
01:51:46,029 --> 01:51:52,390
That like HTML cholesterol comes from like battered fish,

2127
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:58,430
like beer, battered French fries and and like full fat, saturated fat meats and stuff.

2128
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:03,250
So good fat and like good cholesterol.

2129
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:06,859
We're getting residents sleeper again.

2130
01:52:06,859 --> 01:52:09,779
Just to give me this is your fault.

2131
01:52:09,779 --> 01:52:13,699
Chat, whoever who is whoever is residents sleeper in Germany right now.

2132
01:52:13,939 --> 01:52:18,060
You guys are about to go eat some bad cholesterol and have an awful life.

2133
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:22,659
This is the one to live an amazing, healthy life right now.

2134
01:52:22,659 --> 01:52:25,020
You know, when they interviewed like the 95 year old woman, they're like,

2135
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:27,460
Oh, what did you do to live this long and live this healthy?

2136
01:52:27,779 --> 01:52:30,619
And then you just fucking residents sleeper and you don't even listen to her.

2137
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:37,569
German's going to outlast all of you guys because the good ones always die first.

2138
01:52:38,779 --> 01:52:45,390
What someone was here.

2139
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:48,000
Are you implying that I'm like a bad guy?

2140
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,520
No, I'm just saying, like, you know, the health tips like you.

2141
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,720
You're I wanted to hear this explanation.

2142
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:55,329
I've been OK.

2143
01:52:55,329 --> 01:53:02,140
So when you have saturated fat, it means it cannot be your body uses it.

2144
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:06,310
It can't be used. Your body uses fat as unsaturated fat.

2145
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:08,510
This is poly saturated fat, right?

2146
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:11,590
There's a bunch of different like kind of half saturated, full saturated fat.

2147
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:13,390
Your body can does not use it.

2148
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:15,869
It's just junk that has been completely saturated.

2149
01:53:15,869 --> 01:53:19,060
That's why it's called saturated.

2150
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:23,020
Reason why people say to eat peanut butter and eat like avocados and eat

2151
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:27,149
like olive oil is because it's an unsaturated fat.

2152
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:31,720
OK, yeah. Well, what about the cholesterol?

2153
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:34,750
What do you want to know about it?

2154
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:37,170
It's it's it's all good.

2155
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:41,500
OK, let me let me look this up.

2156
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:45,659
LD LDL cholesterol.

2157
01:53:51,739 --> 01:53:53,619
Yeah. What about Hillary's cholesterol?

2158
01:53:53,619 --> 01:53:58,630
Low density cholesterol is one of the five major groups of lipoprotein,

2159
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:03,750
which transport all fat molecules around the body in an extra terrestrial water.

2160
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:06,539
Oh, the cosmic fluid.

2161
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:08,220
So that's the stuff that flows your blood.

2162
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,220
Look, you understand how fucked up our bodies are.

2163
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:13,739
You know how complicated it is and how we even know any of this.

2164
01:54:18,699 --> 01:54:21,939
Our bodies are insane.

2165
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:26,140
You have a thing in your body that pumps blood oxygen shit across your whole body.

2166
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:30,880
Do you really need to know why this all works?

2167
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,989
Yeah, I just want to know.

2168
01:54:34,989 --> 01:54:39,539
I guess at the end of the conversation, we have to go through this morning.

2169
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:41,619
I made myself eggs this morning.

2170
01:54:41,619 --> 01:54:44,770
Does that count or like making eggs beneath you?

2171
01:54:44,770 --> 01:54:46,449
Do you make eggs? What do you have for breakfast?

2172
01:54:46,449 --> 01:54:49,050
I love eggs. Eggs are like one of my favorite breakfast foods.

2173
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:51,300
Yes, I have no idea what we're doing.

2174
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:52,220
Follow the traces.

2175
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:53,020
They lead to the door.

2176
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:55,659
And then the guys like this door is stupid underneath in the water.

2177
01:54:55,659 --> 01:55:05,140
Maybe the cholesterol is not necessarily a bad thing,

2178
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:08,220
but too much of it fills up like plaque in your arteries.

2179
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:19,789
Wait, we can go up here in the event.

2180
01:55:19,789 --> 01:55:27,420
Oh, the secret one of my favorite things is hard boiled eggs

2181
01:55:27,899 --> 01:55:30,460
because especially when I used to work out a lot,

2182
01:55:30,939 --> 01:55:33,880
don't really do it anymore. But, you know, whatever.

2183
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:38,159
Hard boiled eggs were so easy because I would just make like a two dozen of them

2184
01:55:39,739 --> 01:55:42,539
and I would just take them out an hour or two.

2185
01:55:43,579 --> 01:55:46,569
What? Me? You?

2186
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:52,619
So I would make like 12, buy a carton of eggs

2187
01:55:53,819 --> 01:55:56,779
and I would make a boil them up, hard boil eggs,

2188
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:00,180
put them in a container and I would eat two or three of them every day.

2189
01:56:01,659 --> 01:56:04,260
And then I would go to the gym and I would utilize that fat and protein.

2190
01:56:05,489 --> 01:56:09,189
They were really, really easy.

2191
01:56:09,189 --> 01:56:11,229
You would eat eggs before you went to the gym.

2192
01:56:11,229 --> 01:56:13,310
Like maybe an hour, a couple of hours before, an hour before.

2193
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,800
I also used to eat tuna out of the can like a cat.

2194
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:28,909
OK, that's a little weirder.

2195
01:56:28,909 --> 01:56:31,510
Like I would just open the thing and just like drain the water and just eat it.

2196
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:33,189
Like his cat food.

2197
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:40,739
Who is this guy?

2198
01:56:40,739 --> 01:56:43,819
I don't know, but he's holding his hands in a really weird place.

2199
01:56:43,819 --> 01:56:44,979
He's got a knife back there.

2200
01:56:44,979 --> 01:56:47,579
He's hiding. But like his thumbs are like in front of his neck.

2201
01:56:47,819 --> 01:56:49,180
It's kind of weird. Yeah.

2202
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:50,699
Why does his death? Sardines.

2203
01:56:50,699 --> 01:56:51,819
Yeah, sardines are really good, too.

2204
01:56:51,819 --> 01:56:59,590
You're not enjoying your new status, new challenges.

2205
01:56:59,909 --> 01:57:01,750
New possum. Don't I deserve it?

2206
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:03,949
I was on a kick for a long time of eating

2207
01:57:03,949 --> 01:57:06,350
like a tin of sardines, like a couple of times a week.

2208
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:10,380
Crap. Oh, shut up.

2209
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,659
Now give back what you stole from me.

2210
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:18,130
Give back the key, boy.

2211
01:57:19,489 --> 01:57:21,810
Oh, this is broke as a hand.

2212
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:25,649
It's Wesker.

2213
01:57:30,149 --> 01:57:32,069
Nice clip. Nice.

2214
01:57:32,069 --> 01:57:41,800
Ooh, I was watching what you've done.

2215
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:46,859
I hope this guy is a face turn, right?

2216
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:03,390
Seven minutes, seven minutes is all I can spare for you.

2217
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:07,390
You guys like that video?

2218
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:10,369
The video was exactly seven minutes long.

2219
01:58:10,369 --> 01:58:11,810
I love that video.

2220
01:58:11,810 --> 01:58:15,220
It's honestly incredible.

2221
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:24,399
The thought that goes into these things.

2222
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:25,520
What about locks on a bagel?

2223
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:28,560
I have to really be in the mood for a smoke salmon.

2224
01:58:35,619 --> 01:58:39,430
That person's a little different. Let's kill him.

2225
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:43,149
So we fight. Yeah, we fight these people.

2226
01:58:48,109 --> 01:58:49,310
He's killing me.

2227
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:52,430
What I'm in, I'm in goon vision.

2228
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:54,670
Oh, my God, I hit that guy's torso off.

2229
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:57,840
What the fuck?

2230
01:59:08,899 --> 01:59:09,859
The game crashed.

2231
01:59:09,859 --> 01:59:11,430
Oh, what the hell?

2232
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:14,680
No, I had found it.

2233
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:20,899
What's happening here?

2234
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:27,060
You still there? Yeah.

2235
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:30,869
OK, he's in the car factory.

2236
01:59:30,869 --> 01:59:33,310
OK, now we're going to hunt down Wesker.

2237
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:36,149
Get back. OK, so now let's let's follow.

2238
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:38,109
So I think we're going to get a major encounter here.

2239
01:59:38,109 --> 01:59:40,840
Major boss, maybe.

2240
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:41,960
Yeah, the whole world's opening up.

2241
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,039
We're out of the tutorial now.

2242
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:47,000
So we have the same powers as him is what I'm getting here.

2243
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:51,720
That seems to be the case that we were experimented on when we were children

2244
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:56,359
and we were with our our our friend Mia and we want to find her again.

2245
01:59:56,359 --> 02:00:00,000
And she's going to be the key to we're all actually.

2246
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:06,109
The new infested are the people that were together.

2247
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:12,539
This is looks cool.

2248
02:00:12,539 --> 02:00:14,300
You tune it out of the can on stream.

2249
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:14,979
I'm not going to do that.

2250
02:00:14,979 --> 02:00:17,100
It's it was just really easy and really fast,

2251
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:32,090
especially if you were working out a lot.

2252
02:00:32,090 --> 02:00:43,520
Oh, my God. I almost fell through. Oh, God.

2253
02:00:45,159 --> 02:00:47,119
Oh, shit. I saw you do that and I freaked out.

2254
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:49,079
And now I'm going to fall.

2255
02:00:49,079 --> 02:00:52,930
I thought that you did you fall. You said.

2256
02:00:56,819 --> 02:00:59,060
All right. I mean, I'll continue forward, I suppose.

2257
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:01,380
I heard you say, oh, God.

2258
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:02,420
And I saw you fall.

2259
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:16,359
So I was like, wait, maybe I'm doing this wrong.

2260
02:01:16,359 --> 02:01:19,750
I'm coming.

2261
02:01:19,789 --> 02:01:21,460
Let's go, Borpo.

2262
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:24,229
I'm coming.

2263
02:01:24,229 --> 02:01:25,989
Yeah, I'm sorry that you falling was my fault.

2264
02:01:26,909 --> 02:01:28,630
Well, no, I you jumped in the air.

2265
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:30,029
I heard, oh, God.

2266
02:01:30,029 --> 02:01:31,630
Yeah, because of me.

2267
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:36,050
I'm not fucked up. I would do that to you.

2268
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:42,420
So let me see here.

2269
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,420
Hey, die lockpick.

2270
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:47,020
We need some meds.

2271
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:54,020
I actually do need a crafting med kit.

2272
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:56,979
And these are these bandages are starting to not be enough for me anymore.

2273
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:58,939
I've got so much.

2274
02:01:58,939 --> 02:02:00,859
I'm so vascular.

2275
02:02:00,859 --> 02:02:01,979
So much blood.

2276
02:02:01,979 --> 02:02:03,579
Oh, I'm through me.

2277
02:02:03,579 --> 02:02:06,720
What I've had, I didn't get the pick.

2278
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:10,260
Oh, dude, what is it with this one?

2279
02:02:10,859 --> 02:02:16,130
I thought you were reacting to vascular men.

2280
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:20,079
Right. You guys going to complete the entire game?

2281
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:21,899
No. Yeah.

2282
02:02:21,899 --> 02:02:25,579
I think in the next hour or so.

2283
02:02:25,579 --> 02:02:28,699
Stirr definitely is at that point where he's like starting to get a little bored.

2284
02:02:30,109 --> 02:02:31,430
Oh, it's me. It's me again.

2285
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:37,640
Bringing up like sweet potatoes and food and I got the Gundam.

2286
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:40,560
He said something about Gundam's like a Gundam photo, whatever it was.

2287
02:02:43,479 --> 02:02:47,239
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2288
02:02:47,239 --> 02:02:52,739
And we just got to the big the big city out here.

2289
02:02:52,739 --> 02:02:56,619
And it's good. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2290
02:02:56,619 --> 02:03:06,100
Wait. Oh, hey, we got heads.

2291
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:12,819
Is it solar? Yeah.

2292
02:03:12,819 --> 02:03:17,579
Hmm. Oh, watch out heads.

2293
02:03:17,579 --> 02:03:20,289
I want to craft a bomb or something.

2294
02:03:20,289 --> 02:03:22,250
I think I got a bomb.

2295
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:25,569
Oh, they've heard us. Our factory.

2296
02:03:25,569 --> 02:03:26,649
There it is. All right.

2297
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:28,529
What do you got? Bomb.

2298
02:03:34,750 --> 02:03:38,010
Oh, no, you didn't jump and kick them.

2299
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:41,119
Now he's dead.

2300
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:44,880
You just you just put like shrapnel in his eyeballs, but you didn't kick him.

2301
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:55,340
That's my bad. I jumped and kicked him.

2302
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:58,439
Tahini paste.

2303
02:03:58,439 --> 02:04:00,840
No, but that was like I do not recommend that.

2304
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,920
That's that's probably not that great for you, to be honest.

2305
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:23,880
Oh, spear. Nice.

2306
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,350
Is that thing going to blow?

2307
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:29,949
Yeah, I speared right through the metal container

2308
02:04:30,670 --> 02:04:36,020
with my incredible strength.

2309
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:40,220
Come on, come on, come on.

2310
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:50,439
When does Elden Ring come out?

2311
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:52,239
Like really soon, right?

2312
02:04:52,239 --> 02:04:56,250
Uh, hey, hey, hey, he's putting his hands up.

2313
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:58,680
He wants us to stop.

2314
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:02,529
I thought you were serious for saying.

2315
02:05:02,529 --> 02:05:10,039
I am. Don't Thursday of next week.

2316
02:05:10,039 --> 02:05:15,500
Damn. OK.

2317
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:18,180
How come there are more suplexes in video games?

2318
02:05:19,850 --> 02:05:22,369
I agree. That's actually pretty not a bad point.

2319
02:05:25,979 --> 02:05:28,300
I think because you have to make the the models match up

2320
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:29,819
and it depends on which character.

2321
02:05:29,819 --> 02:05:33,010
And it's a whole there was a there was a suplex

2322
02:05:33,010 --> 02:05:37,039
mod for like all the Skyrim games, the scrolls of Skyrim,

2323
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:40,680
and it would always do you think weird and give you this crazy kill cam.

2324
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:44,550
But that's what made it enjoyable.

2325
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:49,840
He's in here somewhere. We go up.

2326
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:58,630
I think we just keep going around.

2327
02:05:58,630 --> 02:06:01,550
Oh, wait. Are you still inside?

2328
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:04,710
I'm out. No. Oh.

2329
02:06:08,409 --> 02:06:11,939
Yeah, maybe we did stop to be in there.

2330
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:14,060
Little auto plant.

2331
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:17,859
Let's go back in.

2332
02:06:17,859 --> 02:06:20,619
These doors feel like they would leave there, but they're fake doors.

2333
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:24,619
I think we can we can climb over.

2334
02:06:24,619 --> 02:06:27,619
Oh, we can climb.

2335
02:06:27,619 --> 02:06:33,260
Or it looks like you can.

2336
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:36,310
How do we climb?

2337
02:06:37,109 --> 02:06:38,670
Oh, I see. There we go.

2338
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:40,909
This way. Oh, you just you just skipped it.

2339
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:44,380
So you guys having fun?

2340
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:50,329
No, not really.

2341
02:06:50,329 --> 02:06:54,210
Right. How did you get up there?

2342
02:06:54,210 --> 02:07:00,600
I jumped that. Oh, I got to go from here to here.

2343
02:07:04,699 --> 02:07:08,479
Oh, fuck off, please.

2344
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:11,319
Come on. Just give it to him.

2345
02:07:11,319 --> 02:07:13,560
Game. I seriously got there.

2346
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:24,539
I was so dumb.

2347
02:07:24,539 --> 02:07:25,899
I'm going to wait up for my blood.

2348
02:07:25,899 --> 02:07:28,619
Thanks, man. My sweet potato bud.

2349
02:07:39,739 --> 02:07:42,380
All right. Where's he at?

2350
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:46,529
No, I'm kidding. We're having a good time. It's fun.

2351
02:07:46,529 --> 02:07:47,770
You're telling jokes.

2352
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:51,859
Somebody asked if we were having a good time, and I said no.

2353
02:07:51,859 --> 02:07:53,600
What's the punch line?

2354
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,800
There isn't. I was making I was just lying.

2355
02:08:00,109 --> 02:08:02,350
Yeah, a lie is the punch line.

2356
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:06,760
OK, so down is this him?

2357
02:08:15,899 --> 02:08:26,590
I'm just swinging.

2358
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:28,989
We should play Fart Simulator 2004.

2359
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:35,699
Some reason I feel like I'm wasting my valuable time.

2360
02:08:37,539 --> 02:08:39,380
I mean, your time is pretty valuable, right?

2361
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:41,739
Like if there's something else you could be doing, maybe.

2362
02:08:46,859 --> 02:08:55,680
All right. He accidentally just snorted some coke.

2363
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:57,840
He's got like an Abraham Lincoln vibe.

2364
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:04,180
It's very official.

2365
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:05,899
And one of his experiments.

2366
02:09:05,899 --> 02:09:13,359
The chance witness something spectacular.

2367
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:16,840
My God, his pants are coming off.

2368
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:19,279
He's got everything comes full circle.

2369
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,880
We return beginning.

2370
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:23,880
Ethan. Hi, Ethan.

2371
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:28,020
Now you will witness history in the making.

2372
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:30,619
You don't understand anything, Ethan.

2373
02:09:30,619 --> 02:09:33,270
I'm going to kill you right now, Ethan.

2374
02:09:33,270 --> 02:09:36,399
Kids, you got a chance, Ethan.

2375
02:09:36,399 --> 02:09:48,659
You were part of something special, but as strong as me.

2376
02:09:48,699 --> 02:09:49,939
That's too red.

2377
02:09:49,939 --> 02:09:54,180
Last words from my sister, sister.

2378
02:09:55,180 --> 02:10:02,939
Red. What?

2379
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:07,220
Oh, betrayed. Instantly betrayed.

2380
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:09,300
Hey, we're friends. I got shot by an arrow.

2381
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:16,130
It's dad. What?

2382
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:24,189
The double, double cross.

2383
02:10:24,189 --> 02:10:27,470
Mother gas coin. Let's go.

2384
02:10:27,470 --> 02:10:28,670
No, we should have watched that.

2385
02:10:28,670 --> 02:10:30,630
That's the one time we should have paid attention.

2386
02:10:30,630 --> 02:10:33,699
Nope. Is he coming?

2387
02:10:33,699 --> 02:10:35,140
Is he chasing us?

2388
02:10:35,140 --> 02:10:38,750
I mean, I have one spend skill points, so.

2389
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:46,859
Wait, that's not even him.

2390
02:10:46,939 --> 02:10:49,579
This is him. Where?

2391
02:10:49,579 --> 02:10:51,180
Oh, in the window.

2392
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:53,060
It's just some random dude.

2393
02:10:53,060 --> 02:11:07,890
Oh, yeah, that's renegade.

2394
02:11:07,890 --> 02:11:09,689
We got to go. OK, let's go.

2395
02:11:09,689 --> 02:11:10,609
We got to go.

2396
02:11:10,609 --> 02:11:14,130
We're here.

2397
02:11:14,130 --> 02:11:17,170
I hope so bad that all of a sudden we here in the distance.

2398
02:11:20,819 --> 02:11:21,979
Here the cutscene ends.

2399
02:11:21,979 --> 02:11:34,180
Run across the street and we're going to start it again.

2400
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:40,739
Why? What happened?

2401
02:11:40,739 --> 02:11:43,100
Oh, Tony Soprano was cooking over here.

2402
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:45,699
He got angry at the grill.

2403
02:11:45,699 --> 02:11:47,119
Not starting.

2404
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:51,380
OK, I think you skipped something really important.

2405
02:11:55,340 --> 02:12:00,569
I don't know.

2406
02:12:00,569 --> 02:12:02,340
Wait, what happened?

2407
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:04,340
I have no idea.

2408
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:09,979
Didn't we go in this door?

2409
02:12:09,979 --> 02:12:16,010
I think we're trying to catch her, but she was on my screen.

2410
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:18,960
It's an indicator over here.

2411
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,359
Escape from Waltz.

2412
02:12:20,359 --> 02:12:24,109
Wait, is this Waltz here?

2413
02:12:24,109 --> 02:12:27,380
We have to go.

2414
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:36,989
You just locked us out of the room.

2415
02:12:36,989 --> 02:12:40,119
How do we go in that door last time?

2416
02:12:40,119 --> 02:12:42,359
My chance saying a soft lock.

2417
02:12:42,359 --> 02:12:45,189
I mean, we're here.

2418
02:12:45,189 --> 02:12:51,500
Maybe get the fuck out of there.

2419
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:55,779
He did it.

2420
02:12:55,779 --> 02:13:05,029
OK, we here we are.

2421
02:13:05,029 --> 02:13:10,829
I can't get through this.

2422
02:13:10,829 --> 02:13:15,869
This got to be a way to get out.

2423
02:13:15,869 --> 02:13:19,970
Wait, it's just to go down here now.

2424
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:27,220
I think we progressed it somehow.

2425
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:30,600
We slide through here.

2426
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:43,939
Yeah, try to jump out now.

2427
02:13:43,939 --> 02:13:46,220
OK, we can't get in there.

2428
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:47,979
I think we have to die.

2429
02:13:47,979 --> 02:13:48,899
I'm in.

2430
02:13:48,939 --> 02:13:53,100
Wait, he's on the map now for me.

2431
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:53,939
What is going on?

2432
02:13:53,939 --> 02:13:56,829
I'm at her.

2433
02:13:56,829 --> 02:13:59,609
OK, I'm going to do that.

2434
02:13:59,609 --> 02:14:02,689
I'm going to go backwards and try and get a trigger.

2435
02:14:02,689 --> 02:14:05,289
He was just on the screen.

2436
02:14:05,289 --> 02:14:06,050
OK, I got her.

2437
02:14:06,050 --> 02:14:08,060
I got her.

2438
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:09,640
Something's happening.

2439
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:24,369
We're going to go this way.

2440
02:14:24,369 --> 02:14:31,529
Wait, there she is.

2441
02:14:31,529 --> 02:14:33,050
I needed that.

2442
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:33,649
Just grab it.

2443
02:14:33,649 --> 02:14:34,250
Grab the top.

2444
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:35,369
You got to jump.

2445
02:14:35,369 --> 02:14:41,930
You grab it at the same time.

2446
02:14:41,930 --> 02:14:51,550
All right, finally, here we are.

2447
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:55,689
Why did she stay here and then shut the door?

2448
02:14:55,689 --> 02:15:04,930
I think we got it.

2449
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:09,180
Flashlights on.

2450
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:09,819
Oh, that's him.

2451
02:15:09,819 --> 02:15:11,260
He's literally here.

2452
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:14,039
We actually get to see him now.

2453
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:15,840
Oh, he's right behind me.

2454
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,119
Dude, you're about to get Western.

2455
02:15:17,119 --> 02:15:20,000
You have any grenades?

2456
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:36,810
I got some coins.

2457
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:39,840
You're just running in circles.

2458
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:42,600
That guy had no idea where we went, by the way.

2459
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:58,060
Not a clue.

2460
02:15:58,060 --> 02:15:59,930
What?

2461
02:15:59,930 --> 02:16:03,649
He's not behind us.

2462
02:16:03,649 --> 02:16:06,529
What is?

2463
02:16:06,529 --> 02:16:07,850
I can't swim.

2464
02:16:07,850 --> 02:16:10,460
What do you mean you can't swim?

2465
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:12,000
Are you all right?

2466
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,500
No, I can't swim.

2467
02:16:17,699 --> 02:16:23,310
Did you just drown?

2468
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:25,829
I think he's supposed to be behind us constantly,

2469
02:16:25,829 --> 02:16:29,119
but he's not.

2470
02:16:29,119 --> 02:16:30,279
This is supposed to be very scary.

2471
02:16:30,279 --> 02:16:31,680
Oh, there he is.

2472
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:32,879
Oh, there he is.

2473
02:16:32,879 --> 02:16:35,159
There he is.

2474
02:16:35,159 --> 02:16:37,159
Wait, he doesn't know where we are.

2475
02:16:37,159 --> 02:16:43,000
Oh, shit, he found me.

2476
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:53,239
He's right behind me.

2477
02:16:53,239 --> 02:17:00,770
Oh, shit, he's right behind me.

2478
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:02,290
I don't know where did you go?

2479
02:17:02,290 --> 02:17:02,930
Where did you go?

2480
02:17:02,930 --> 02:17:04,290
He's behind me.

2481
02:17:04,290 --> 02:17:06,180
I'm dead.

2482
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:15,360
I don't think you matter.

2483
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:16,680
I don't?

2484
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:26,100
I actually don't matter.

2485
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:27,979
So why don't I just distract him?

2486
02:17:27,979 --> 02:17:32,299
Oh, you just have to get there.

2487
02:17:32,299 --> 02:17:33,780
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

2488
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:35,579
Dude, you don't see what I'm seeing either.

2489
02:17:35,579 --> 02:17:37,860
This lady just keeps disappearing and teleporting.

2490
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:40,659
And this whole thing has been a fever dream.

2491
02:17:40,659 --> 02:17:42,620
There he is again.

2492
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:43,620
I got me.

2493
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:44,059
He got you.

2494
02:17:44,059 --> 02:17:44,620
Wait, I can get you.

2495
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:47,350
I can help you.

2496
02:17:47,350 --> 02:17:57,639
Oh, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.

2497
02:17:57,639 --> 02:17:58,680
What the fuck?

2498
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:01,350
What happened?

2499
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:04,030
He died so that I could live.

2500
02:18:04,030 --> 02:18:06,629
I got to make it out of here for the both of us.

2501
02:18:06,709 --> 02:18:11,040
He was just looking at us.

2502
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:15,700
The music.

2503
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:25,020
I did not make the jump to this ladder, by the way.

2504
02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:27,379
I had to shoot you to keep up appearances.

2505
02:18:27,379 --> 02:18:38,379
What?

2506
02:18:38,379 --> 02:18:41,010
Nate, and you?

2507
02:18:41,010 --> 02:18:42,370
Show me your arm.

2508
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:49,370
Come on, I won't bite.

2509
02:18:49,370 --> 02:18:50,250
See, I'm not infected.

2510
02:18:50,250 --> 02:18:53,500
We have something in common.

2511
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:55,940
I was one of that crazy fucker's subjects too.

2512
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:58,620
Well, hers does not light up.

2513
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:00,700
Mia, did you know a girl named Mia?

2514
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:01,579
Mia?

2515
02:19:01,579 --> 02:19:02,340
No.

2516
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:02,860
Who's Mia?

2517
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:05,219
She's my sister.

2518
02:19:05,219 --> 02:19:06,700
We were in a GRB place together.

2519
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:07,579
I have to find her.

2520
02:19:07,579 --> 02:19:11,739
Well, if she's alive, she must be pouring herself with water

2521
02:19:11,739 --> 02:19:13,059
somewhere in the city.

2522
02:19:13,059 --> 02:19:13,739
What?

2523
02:19:13,739 --> 02:19:14,579
Not that I blame her.

2524
02:19:14,579 --> 02:19:15,260
Where did you go?

2525
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:15,860
What are you saying?

2526
02:19:15,860 --> 02:19:16,379
Fuck you.

2527
02:19:16,379 --> 02:19:17,780
Whoa, Gaja.

2528
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:18,579
I am you.

2529
02:19:18,579 --> 02:19:20,270
Time is what we live in.

2530
02:19:20,270 --> 02:19:21,030
Just saying.

2531
02:19:21,030 --> 02:19:22,309
I have to find her.

2532
02:19:22,309 --> 02:19:24,110
Well, first, let's fuck out of here.

2533
02:19:24,110 --> 02:19:25,510
Not sure we managed to ditch that cycle.

2534
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:27,389
Right?

2535
02:19:27,389 --> 02:19:34,659
All right, so he's still chasing us.

2536
02:19:34,659 --> 02:19:39,239
OK, he's still on the map.

2537
02:19:39,239 --> 02:19:43,309
Oh, we got to follow the sniper.

2538
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:46,229
She won't tell us her name, because her name's Mia.

2539
02:19:46,229 --> 02:19:49,899
Hell, she's fast.

2540
02:19:49,899 --> 02:19:53,420
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

2541
02:19:53,420 --> 02:19:55,299
dun, dun.

2542
02:19:55,299 --> 02:20:02,059
Lube's not far away.

2543
02:20:02,059 --> 02:20:07,309
We'll be safe there.

2544
02:20:07,309 --> 02:20:08,389
Come on.

2545
02:20:08,389 --> 02:20:19,940
I'm coming.

2546
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:21,979
Let's try to stay human.

2547
02:20:21,979 --> 02:20:31,290
You're here.

2548
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:35,030
We're just a million miles away.

2549
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:38,069
You have nightmares about what he did to us.

2550
02:20:38,069 --> 02:20:39,350
All the time.

2551
02:20:39,350 --> 02:20:41,790
That's why I want to kill the fucker.

2552
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:45,709
Waltz is number three on my list.

2553
02:20:45,709 --> 02:20:48,790
So Wendy's number one.

2554
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:49,909
You got a hit list.

2555
02:20:49,909 --> 02:20:51,069
You got a hit list.

2556
02:20:51,069 --> 02:20:52,350
Seriously.

2557
02:20:52,350 --> 02:20:53,709
Do I look like I'm kidding?

2558
02:20:53,709 --> 02:20:55,270
The city's got a lot of trash.

2559
02:20:55,270 --> 02:20:55,909
Yeah.

2560
02:20:55,909 --> 02:20:57,309
Who else is on it?

2561
02:20:57,309 --> 02:21:00,750
Besides Waltz, Butcher, Hackon, and.

2562
02:21:00,750 --> 02:21:01,709
Oh, wait.

2563
02:21:01,709 --> 02:21:03,350
Hackon.

2564
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:04,950
There's a few.

2565
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:07,030
She's the one who shot him, dude.

2566
02:21:07,030 --> 02:21:08,850
He got.

2567
02:21:08,850 --> 02:21:10,409
We got it.

2568
02:21:10,409 --> 02:21:13,389
When are they going to reveal that that's Mia?

2569
02:21:13,389 --> 02:21:26,450
They're not going to.

2570
02:21:26,450 --> 02:21:28,420
Aiden, you there?

2571
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:29,139
Yeah.

2572
02:21:29,139 --> 02:21:32,659
I mean, the sniper is sort of weird, right?

2573
02:21:32,659 --> 02:21:36,069
Like, sniper is going to be a reveal.

2574
02:21:36,069 --> 02:21:38,250
I don't know if it's going to be Mia, though.

2575
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:39,010
Why wouldn't it be?

2576
02:21:39,010 --> 02:21:40,969
Who else could it be that we know the name of,

2577
02:21:40,969 --> 02:21:43,569
that they would be hiding the name?

2578
02:21:43,569 --> 02:21:46,889
When otherwise, these Ubisoft style games are like,

2579
02:21:46,889 --> 02:21:49,250
we want you to know who our goofy zany characters are.

2580
02:21:49,250 --> 02:21:53,170
This is Zilpo, the fucking, the goofy, you know,

2581
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:57,530
one time amount.

2582
02:21:57,530 --> 02:21:59,329
Zilpo.

2583
02:21:59,329 --> 02:22:03,860
Yeah, I see you on the list.

2584
02:22:03,860 --> 02:22:07,059
Because, you know, I like these blue puppets that be death.

2585
02:22:07,059 --> 02:22:09,659
I thought my dear is alone.

2586
02:22:09,659 --> 02:22:11,870
Let's just say everyone on that.

2587
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:15,649
But where did you get that?

2588
02:22:15,649 --> 02:22:17,819
Don't worry, I can handle this.

2589
02:22:17,819 --> 02:22:20,219
Yeah, you know, don't he's dead.

2590
02:22:20,219 --> 02:22:25,219
Waltz, oh, so maybe we were meant to meet.

2591
02:22:25,219 --> 02:22:30,219
Okay, P.K., Commander Lucas, P.K., P.K., P.K., Pree.

2592
02:23:02,819 --> 02:23:03,659
Let's Waltz.

2593
02:23:03,659 --> 02:23:07,540
All right, bring lavender and metal parts to Nero, okay.

2594
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:08,379
We got a bow.

2595
02:23:08,379 --> 02:23:09,219
We got a bow.

2596
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:10,940
Oh, dude.

2597
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:12,659
Have to use it.

2598
02:23:12,659 --> 02:23:15,139
Oh, yeah, man.

2599
02:23:15,139 --> 02:23:15,979
How do we use it?

2600
02:23:15,979 --> 02:23:26,620
I'm gonna be an archer, like that show Archer.

2601
02:23:26,620 --> 02:23:30,180
Me and my ax in my bum, in my bum.

2602
02:23:30,180 --> 02:23:31,219
In my bum.

2603
02:23:31,219 --> 02:23:32,059
What?

2604
02:23:32,059 --> 02:23:32,899
That's not what I said.

2605
02:23:32,899 --> 02:23:35,020
Me and my ax in my bum.

2606
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:35,860
In my, in my bum.

2607
02:23:35,860 --> 02:23:38,780
In my ax, stop saying this.

2608
02:23:38,780 --> 02:23:40,579
I'm trying to do a thing here.

2609
02:23:41,540 --> 02:23:45,940
In my ax, and I can't even.

2610
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:47,379
Hey, you just walk by an inhibitor.

2611
02:23:47,379 --> 02:23:50,629
Wait, we're still following her?

2612
02:23:50,629 --> 02:23:52,510
Hey, bud, you just walk by an inhibitor, bud.

2613
02:23:52,510 --> 02:23:57,780
Hey, bud, down here there's an inhibitor, bud.

2614
02:23:57,780 --> 02:24:00,030
And there's a bed in here, too, bud.

2615
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:01,829
Thanks, bud.

2616
02:24:01,829 --> 02:24:03,159
Hey, no problem, bud.

2617
02:24:03,159 --> 02:24:06,520
In my bum, in my bum, in my bum.

2618
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:07,360
In my bum.

2619
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,520
Silence.

2620
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:13,559
What are you saying if it's not in my bum?

2621
02:24:13,559 --> 02:24:15,079
The Lord of the Rings, when they say,

2622
02:24:15,079 --> 02:24:18,879
and my ax, and my sword, and my bow,

2623
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:20,360
when they say, like, at the fellowship of the ring,

2624
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:23,049
yes, we're gonna work together.

2625
02:24:23,049 --> 02:24:24,969
And you made a song about this moment,

2626
02:24:24,969 --> 02:24:25,809
and you sing in my bum.

2627
02:24:25,809 --> 02:24:26,850
That's what I do.

2628
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:28,450
I make songs.

2629
02:24:28,450 --> 02:24:29,690
I make little jingles.

2630
02:24:29,690 --> 02:24:31,690
That's what I do here.

2631
02:24:31,690 --> 02:24:32,850
I was sightseeing.

2632
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:35,569
With some volume, but, with some volume, but.

2633
02:24:35,569 --> 02:24:37,909
I thought you did, like,

2634
02:24:37,909 --> 02:24:39,309
I thought you did nunchucks.

2635
02:24:39,309 --> 02:24:40,870
Oh, shit, look.

2636
02:24:40,870 --> 02:24:41,709
I do that, too.

2637
02:24:41,709 --> 02:24:57,260
You too?

2638
02:24:57,260 --> 02:25:00,590
Fuck.

2639
02:25:00,590 --> 02:25:02,229
I don't know, we're getting, like,

2640
02:25:02,229 --> 02:25:06,520
Nick Fury just walked in the room.

2641
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:08,850
That's the same soundtrack.

2642
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:10,370
See what?

2643
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:13,620
What's going on?

2644
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:16,350
I'm coming, Mia.

2645
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:18,309
Yeah, I don't go by Mia anymore.

2646
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:24,559
That was the name that they gave me.

2647
02:25:24,559 --> 02:25:29,680
I'm still holding on to it.

2648
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:31,399
I think we've opened up the game.

2649
02:25:31,399 --> 02:25:32,989
I was wrong.

2650
02:25:32,989 --> 02:25:38,500
Can't see shit.

2651
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:40,899
I'm gonna unlock the best part of the game, really.

2652
02:25:40,899 --> 02:25:44,659
Fucking d-

2653
02:25:44,659 --> 02:25:46,120
It's peaceful.

2654
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:51,040
Soul.

2655
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:52,440
Why am I just gonna push her?

2656
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:59,700
I can't believe it.

2657
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:00,540
Electricity.

2658
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:06,739
I can't believe it.

2659
02:26:06,739 --> 02:26:08,299
Come on, you're seeing this.

2660
02:26:08,299 --> 02:26:11,219
This has happened, dark as hell for 50 years.

2661
02:26:11,219 --> 02:26:12,059
Chicken pie.

2662
02:26:12,059 --> 02:26:13,430
I don't know, no.

2663
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:15,350
Yeah, I could go for some chicken pie.

2664
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:17,309
Then drop by the canteen and let's eat.

2665
02:26:17,309 --> 02:26:19,270
While shotgunning beers and screwdrivers.

2666
02:26:19,270 --> 02:26:20,110
You know it.

2667
02:26:20,110 --> 02:26:21,229
You dumbass.

2668
02:26:22,430 --> 02:26:28,219
Hey, what happened?

2669
02:26:28,219 --> 02:26:29,860
You skipped too fast.

2670
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:31,180
What the hell's going on?

2671
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:32,180
So that's the fish eye.

2672
02:26:32,180 --> 02:26:33,620
Okay, how do we get there?

2673
02:26:33,620 --> 02:26:34,579
The fish eye's gotta be-

2674
02:26:34,579 --> 02:26:35,860
The power just went out again.

2675
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:40,180
Somebody's like, but they didn't realize

2676
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:41,780
is that they only had it on a few fuses.

2677
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:43,860
Somebody just fucking microwaved a bag of popcorn

2678
02:26:43,860 --> 02:26:44,700
and just fucking turned the whole thing up.

2679
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:45,979
She gave us the paraglider.

2680
02:26:45,979 --> 02:26:46,819
We're paragliders.

2681
02:26:46,819 --> 02:26:51,010
Hold Z to open the paraglider.

2682
02:26:51,010 --> 02:26:52,969
Hold Z, press S.

2683
02:26:52,969 --> 02:27:00,799
Oh baby, here we go.

2684
02:27:00,799 --> 02:27:02,879
What, are you gonna really do this to me?

2685
02:27:02,879 --> 02:27:04,879
You're leaving the mission area?

2686
02:27:04,879 --> 02:27:10,170
I won't go forward.

2687
02:27:10,170 --> 02:27:11,809
That wasn't a paraglider.

2688
02:27:11,809 --> 02:27:19,920
That was like a parachute.

2689
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:20,760
Press S to stabilize.

2690
02:27:21,159 --> 02:27:22,000
What do you mean?

2691
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,559
What are you talking about?

2692
02:27:23,559 --> 02:27:25,239
How am I leaving the mission area?

2693
02:27:25,239 --> 02:27:26,680
As you're going too low, you gotta press S.

2694
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:28,159
It's teaching you to press S.

2695
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:35,110
It's like, hey, press S right now.

2696
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:40,340
Oh, cool.

2697
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:41,180
We unlocked it.

2698
02:27:41,180 --> 02:27:47,860
We got it.

2699
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:48,780
Hey, meet me down here.

2700
02:27:48,780 --> 02:27:50,579
Oh, gas can.

2701
02:27:50,579 --> 02:27:52,389
What?

2702
02:27:52,389 --> 02:27:54,510
I'm down a little bit.

2703
02:27:54,510 --> 02:27:56,819
Why did you tell me to come down here?

2704
02:27:56,819 --> 02:27:58,780
Well, this is the objective, but you landed high

2705
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:00,500
and I'm not good enough to do that.

2706
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:01,500
The objective is up there.

2707
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:03,260
You have to talk to Mia.

2708
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:04,739
Yeah, I'm talking to Mia.

2709
02:28:04,819 --> 02:28:06,100
I just talked to her and getting the fuck out of this.

2710
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:06,940
I fell.

2711
02:28:08,450 --> 02:28:11,860
I can teleport you.

2712
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:19,450
I was, I was.

2713
02:28:19,450 --> 02:28:20,909
Come on.

2714
02:28:20,909 --> 02:28:22,750
Come on.

2715
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:23,590
Come on.

2716
02:28:23,590 --> 02:28:24,430
Come on, dude.

2717
02:28:24,430 --> 02:28:26,590
That was almost bad.

2718
02:28:26,590 --> 02:28:28,229
How do you get up and get dressed in the morning?

2719
02:28:28,229 --> 02:28:30,350
I just rip open my closet and just grab

2720
02:28:30,350 --> 02:28:32,229
and just like, rip shit off the hangers

2721
02:28:32,229 --> 02:28:33,709
and rip the shirts and stuff

2722
02:28:33,709 --> 02:28:35,190
and smush it all over my face

2723
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:37,430
and smush it and rub all of my face

2724
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:38,430
until it gets on me.

2725
02:28:38,430 --> 02:28:42,329
He still has his mommy do it.

2726
02:28:42,329 --> 02:28:44,610
I've seen it.

2727
02:28:44,610 --> 02:28:46,090
Using air vents.

2728
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:46,969
Yeah, okay, yeah.

2729
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:49,090
The air vents are pumping so hard.

2730
02:28:49,090 --> 02:28:50,370
I just roll around on the ground

2731
02:28:50,370 --> 02:28:53,299
until it gets on one arm.

2732
02:28:53,299 --> 02:28:54,500
You fly into the vents.

2733
02:29:07,629 --> 02:29:09,430
You're not saying the thing that Mario does

2734
02:29:09,430 --> 02:29:12,389
when he jumps off the edge of a level you can't fall off of.

2735
02:29:12,389 --> 02:29:13,229
What does he say?

2736
02:29:13,229 --> 02:29:14,909
Come on, you know what he says.

2737
02:29:14,909 --> 02:29:16,110
Hello.

2738
02:29:16,110 --> 02:29:16,950
Holy shit.

2739
02:29:16,950 --> 02:29:17,790
Mario.

2740
02:29:17,790 --> 02:29:19,590
Wow, oh my God.

2741
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:22,590
Are you kidding me?

2742
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:23,590
Is that not what he says?

2743
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:26,020
No.

2744
02:29:29,530 --> 02:29:37,020
That wasn't even close.

2745
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:37,860
Hey, let me help you.

2746
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:38,860
I'll do the sound effect.

2747
02:29:38,860 --> 02:29:44,020
Okay.

2748
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:50,219
What?

2749
02:29:50,219 --> 02:29:53,659
What the fuck was that?

2750
02:29:53,659 --> 02:29:54,860
It was like in a horror movie

2751
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:56,700
where like your phone starts going static

2752
02:29:56,700 --> 02:30:07,579
because the ghost is nearby.

2753
02:30:07,579 --> 02:30:09,979
Does she have one of these things?

2754
02:30:09,979 --> 02:30:10,940
Yeah, she goes first.

2755
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:14,090
But you have to control the wind.

2756
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:17,450
It controls you.

2757
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:18,649
Okay.

2758
02:30:18,649 --> 02:30:20,819
Okay.

2759
02:30:20,819 --> 02:30:21,659
Show us.

2760
02:30:21,659 --> 02:30:23,440
Okay.

2761
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:26,979
Show us what it means to fly.

2762
02:30:26,979 --> 02:30:29,850
Ah, good joke.

2763
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:33,690
What did you do?

2764
02:30:33,690 --> 02:30:44,620
I'm coming.

2765
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:47,739
I don't know how to control this.

2766
02:30:47,739 --> 02:30:49,540
You need to control the wind.

2767
02:30:49,700 --> 02:30:51,579
I'm out of stamina.

2768
02:30:51,579 --> 02:31:01,799
Oh no.

2769
02:31:01,799 --> 02:31:03,639
I was going to come save you.

2770
02:31:03,639 --> 02:31:04,479
Okay.

2771
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:06,000
Here we go.

2772
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:06,920
Oh, by the way, I just want to let you know,

2773
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:08,159
your weapon's almost broken.

2774
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:09,000
Well, where are we going?

2775
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:14,590
Okay, now she's going.

2776
02:31:14,590 --> 02:31:15,430
Here we go.

2777
02:31:15,430 --> 02:31:16,389
Control the wind.

2778
02:31:16,389 --> 02:31:17,229
There.

2779
02:31:17,229 --> 02:31:21,620
Oh, you get stamina when you go over that shit.

2780
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:23,219
If we could collide in the air,

2781
02:31:23,219 --> 02:31:25,870
that would be kind of funny.

2782
02:31:25,870 --> 02:31:26,709
Is there a break?

2783
02:31:26,709 --> 02:31:27,530
How do you get off?

2784
02:31:27,530 --> 02:31:28,370
Like what's break?

2785
02:31:28,370 --> 02:31:29,209
What's break?

2786
02:31:29,209 --> 02:31:30,030
I don't know what break is.

2787
02:31:30,030 --> 02:31:30,870
How do I just go?

2788
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:31,709
Crouch, crouch, crouch.

2789
02:31:31,709 --> 02:31:32,530
Is it actually crouch?

2790
02:31:32,530 --> 02:31:33,370
Are you making that up?

2791
02:31:33,370 --> 02:31:34,270
Yeah, it's actually crouch.

2792
02:31:34,270 --> 02:31:41,690
All right, we'll just hit the button.

2793
02:31:41,690 --> 02:31:43,290
Oh, you're back soon.

2794
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:44,510
I got here before you.

2795
02:31:44,510 --> 02:31:46,770
Well, you did super good on your hang glider,

2796
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:48,729
but have you ever done it this way?

2797
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:51,620
Okay, we're going somewhere to activate.

2798
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:52,459
That's what she sounds like.

2799
02:31:52,459 --> 02:31:56,620
What?

2800
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:57,459
I can make fun of her.

2801
02:31:57,459 --> 02:31:59,610
She's my sister.

2802
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:10,540
Activate the electrical substation.

2803
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:12,100
So you said C is break.

2804
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:14,729
C is let go.

2805
02:32:14,729 --> 02:32:15,569
You said it was break.

2806
02:32:15,569 --> 02:32:16,690
You said how do you get to the ground?

2807
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:17,690
I didn't say break.

2808
02:32:17,690 --> 02:32:20,850
You can't break something that is guided by the wind.

2809
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:23,809
You can tilt it the other way so it fills the air.

2810
02:32:23,809 --> 02:32:27,090
You go backwards so it fills it up.

2811
02:32:27,090 --> 02:32:30,170
The air pushes into the big balloon shit.

2812
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:36,879
You tilt it up so the air slows you down.

2813
02:32:36,879 --> 02:32:48,579
This is a video game.

2814
02:32:48,579 --> 02:32:49,899
I think you have to get enough speed

2815
02:32:49,899 --> 02:32:53,299
and when you have the owl hat with the tail,

2816
02:32:53,299 --> 02:32:55,459
then you jump with the cape.

2817
02:32:55,459 --> 02:32:59,340
Can I not climb this?

2818
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:00,180
Dude, there's Zeds in here.

2819
02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:01,000
Is there an event right here?

2820
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:01,840
There is right there.

2821
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:05,159
There's events down here and yeah, there's Zeds up here.

2822
02:33:05,159 --> 02:33:06,440
So I could really use some help.

2823
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:10,309
Oh my God, damn it.

2824
02:33:10,309 --> 02:33:18,370
Someone is crying for help.

2825
02:33:18,370 --> 02:33:20,569
I have to go around.

2826
02:33:20,569 --> 02:33:22,889
I haven't figured it out yet.

2827
02:33:22,889 --> 02:33:24,850
This isn't even where we're going.

2828
02:33:24,850 --> 02:33:25,969
It's not?

2829
02:33:25,969 --> 02:33:32,319
No, it's a building over this way.

2830
02:33:32,319 --> 02:33:37,930
Let me just turn.

2831
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:40,250
Please, look, I've got to turn the right way.

2832
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:45,209
It used to be a Knight Runner's favorite.

2833
02:33:45,209 --> 02:33:49,860
Me, Knight Runner?

2834
02:33:49,860 --> 02:33:51,340
Really something, Aiden.

2835
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:52,379
We'll hear of it.

2836
02:33:52,379 --> 02:33:53,780
I'm holding S. Just relax.

2837
02:33:53,780 --> 02:34:04,149
The only thing I had in common, maybe.

2838
02:34:04,149 --> 02:34:05,909
Somebody's pressing that button.

2839
02:34:06,389 --> 02:34:10,329
Yeah, I hear him.

2840
02:34:10,329 --> 02:34:12,790
It's fine, I'm ignoring him.

2841
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:15,709
I'm self-killing the zombies.

2842
02:34:15,709 --> 02:34:18,930
I'm something of an assassin.

2843
02:34:18,930 --> 02:34:19,850
Are you up higher?

2844
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:24,579
I'm right here.

2845
02:34:24,579 --> 02:34:30,370
Oh, there you are.

2846
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:33,809
Finally, level three enemies.

2847
02:34:33,809 --> 02:34:35,010
New crafting recipe.

2848
02:34:45,579 --> 02:34:46,420
Okay, where are we going?

2849
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:50,020
You kind of feel like, so we've been waiting for this.

2850
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:51,540
I feel like we just did,

2851
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:54,459
we waited in line at Disney World for like three hours

2852
02:34:54,459 --> 02:34:59,790
to go on Soarin' and like the ride is now over.

2853
02:34:59,790 --> 02:35:02,190
It was like fucking two minutes, three minutes.

2854
02:35:02,190 --> 02:35:04,959
And I don't think I don't care anymore.

2855
02:35:04,959 --> 02:35:05,799
You don't care anymore?

2856
02:35:05,799 --> 02:35:09,659
Like we just rode the ride that we were waiting for.

2857
02:35:09,659 --> 02:35:12,219
Yeah.

2858
02:35:12,219 --> 02:35:16,020
You know, they like spray scents in your nose.

2859
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:17,680
What?

2860
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:19,239
You've never gone on Soarin' before?

2861
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:21,899
That guy kind of looks like you.

2862
02:35:27,930 --> 02:35:28,930
Who's Soarin'?

2863
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:32,370
Who are these guys?

2864
02:35:32,370 --> 02:35:35,889
I don't know, but apparently we're fighting them.

2865
02:35:35,889 --> 02:35:37,290
I'm gonna drop kick them.

2866
02:35:45,739 --> 02:35:48,100
I think the guy behind you is also mad at you.

2867
02:35:54,149 --> 02:35:58,790
They're all doing the stunt man in a movie from the nineties.

2868
02:35:58,790 --> 02:36:02,100
They have like eight articles of clothing on.

2869
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:13,569
They're all like burnt.

2870
02:36:13,569 --> 02:36:15,530
This guy actually is not, we have to talk to him now.

2871
02:36:15,530 --> 02:36:16,809
Now they're not fighting anymore.

2872
02:36:16,809 --> 02:36:19,649
Wait, don't, they're not, don't, okay.

2873
02:36:19,649 --> 02:36:20,489
Over here.

2874
02:36:20,489 --> 02:36:22,010
The guy that's engulfed in flames

2875
02:36:22,010 --> 02:36:24,959
that's walking around like a toddler.

2876
02:36:24,959 --> 02:36:32,950
Cause he's wearing like five flame like suits on.

2877
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:34,899
Can you come over here?

2878
02:36:34,899 --> 02:36:36,340
I'm trying to take the story seriously.

2879
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:38,420
I got involved, I'm invested in the characters

2880
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:40,059
now that Wesker's in the game.

2881
02:36:40,059 --> 02:36:40,899
My name's A.

2882
02:36:40,899 --> 02:36:43,180
Hey, you guys know this one?

2883
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:46,840
What did the bullets say to the man that got shot?

2884
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:49,260
What is it?

2885
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:50,540
You're Swiss cheese, you're dead.

2886
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:51,899
Just passing through, bang, bang.

2887
02:36:51,899 --> 02:36:53,299
Wait, what was it?

2888
02:36:53,299 --> 02:36:55,020
What did the bullets say to the man that got shot?

2889
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:56,799
You got this right.

2890
02:36:56,799 --> 02:36:58,200
Just passing through.

2891
02:36:58,200 --> 02:36:59,520
Come on, man.

2892
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:02,559
Yeah.

2893
02:37:02,559 --> 02:37:04,959
You severed his limbs with a machete knit-taff.

2894
02:37:04,959 --> 02:37:06,959
Technically speaking, that's a melee weapon

2895
02:37:06,959 --> 02:37:08,719
while bullets are reserved for-

2896
02:37:08,719 --> 02:37:11,280
I'm glad you're fine too.

2897
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:12,899
Bullets?

2898
02:37:12,899 --> 02:37:14,700
You still want to climb up there, Aiden?

2899
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:16,100
Not for free, of course.

2900
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:19,299
We reward specialists if you need.

2901
02:37:21,049 --> 02:37:24,399
What are we looking at?

2902
02:37:24,399 --> 02:37:27,040
We're climbing up into the building.

2903
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:29,760
And I think we're doing the unlock the front door

2904
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:31,319
for the people.

2905
02:37:31,319 --> 02:37:32,639
Okay.

2906
02:37:32,639 --> 02:37:33,479
Well, let's get up there.

2907
02:37:33,479 --> 02:37:34,319
But we need to go around and figure out

2908
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:36,829
how to get up there.

2909
02:37:36,829 --> 02:37:38,069
I think we can just run up here like this

2910
02:37:38,069 --> 02:37:43,530
and go, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

2911
02:37:43,530 --> 02:37:44,370
I don't think so.

2912
02:37:44,370 --> 02:37:45,930
Why is it telling me to press F?

2913
02:37:52,329 --> 02:37:53,329
I think you did it.

2914
02:37:55,190 --> 02:37:56,030
Yep.

2915
02:37:57,719 --> 02:37:58,559
How'd you do that?

2916
02:38:00,079 --> 02:38:00,920
I don't know.

2917
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:01,760
Oh, hold on.

2918
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:02,600
How's it look?

2919
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:05,079
Somebody was in a big hurry when they took it offline.

2920
02:38:05,079 --> 02:38:06,079
Somebody went inside the building.

2921
02:38:06,079 --> 02:38:09,120
I would surmise the main circuit suffered a break.

2922
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:11,639
Find a cable and connect the source of power

2923
02:38:11,639 --> 02:38:13,000
to the transmitter.

2924
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,360
That should restore the circuit.

2925
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:19,290
There's like a whole thing going on in here now.

2926
02:38:19,290 --> 02:38:20,129
Electrical station.

2927
02:38:20,129 --> 02:38:21,129
There's like a whole tutorial.

2928
02:38:21,129 --> 02:38:21,969
Report in.

2929
02:38:21,969 --> 02:38:23,899
Yep, I'm on top of the substation.

2930
02:38:23,899 --> 02:38:27,260
Trying to connect power to the transmitter.

2931
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:28,979
And the piece of cake in here after all.

2932
02:38:28,979 --> 02:38:29,819
Always another tutorial.

2933
02:38:29,819 --> 02:38:31,299
Are you sure you're gonna make it?

2934
02:38:31,299 --> 02:38:32,979
I met a bunch of PKs who couldn't get

2935
02:38:32,979 --> 02:38:35,219
to the substation themselves.

2936
02:38:35,219 --> 02:38:37,500
So that's why you haven't called me yet.

2937
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:38,659
Is it connected to you?

2938
02:38:39,100 --> 02:38:39,940
Yeah.

2939
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:40,780
Okay, so what do you bring?

2940
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:42,659
I got a release cable button.

2941
02:38:42,659 --> 02:38:43,579
All right, so now what we have to do

2942
02:38:43,579 --> 02:38:45,340
is we have to literally make a mess

2943
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:47,139
and drag that across the whole game.

2944
02:38:48,540 --> 02:38:49,819
It's not a distance.

2945
02:38:49,819 --> 02:38:51,219
Oh.

2946
02:38:51,219 --> 02:38:56,219
It can only go, it can only go like 17 meters.

2947
02:38:57,959 --> 02:38:59,479
I thought we were in America.

2948
02:38:59,479 --> 02:39:00,319
But.

2949
02:39:00,319 --> 02:39:02,040
They have their own men.

2950
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:03,120
The free folk.

2951
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:06,079
Someone should be on their side.

2952
02:39:06,079 --> 02:39:09,139
Not people like us.

2953
02:39:09,139 --> 02:39:10,459
Now think about it.

2954
02:39:10,459 --> 02:39:11,299
Where are you supposed to bring it?

2955
02:39:11,299 --> 02:39:13,170
Just don't take too long, Gaja.

2956
02:39:14,010 --> 02:39:14,850
I can't go.

2957
02:39:14,850 --> 02:39:15,690
I'm stuck.

2958
02:39:15,690 --> 02:39:16,530
It's probably like right here though.

2959
02:39:16,530 --> 02:39:17,370
Oh, no, no, no.

2960
02:39:17,370 --> 02:39:18,209
I think it's right here.

2961
02:39:18,209 --> 02:39:19,049
It's right across the way.

2962
02:39:19,049 --> 02:39:21,620
It's the competition, huh?

2963
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:23,760
Yeah, it's right here.

2964
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:24,600
Bring it to me.

2965
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:32,459
Wait, can we cast her up?

2966
02:39:32,459 --> 02:39:37,370
This one's over here.

2967
02:39:37,370 --> 02:39:38,889
I think we need a different cable for that one.

2968
02:39:38,889 --> 02:39:40,450
Different cable?

2969
02:39:40,450 --> 02:39:41,290
Yeah.

2970
02:39:41,290 --> 02:39:42,129
Now it's looking like it's gonna be

2971
02:39:42,129 --> 02:39:45,809
up on the roof there, chump.

2972
02:39:45,809 --> 02:39:48,170
All right, it's time to criticize video games again.

2973
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:49,049
Who wants to do this?

2974
02:39:49,049 --> 02:39:52,540
Who cares?

2975
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:55,260
Isn't this getting your brain juices going?

2976
02:39:55,260 --> 02:39:56,100
No, not really.

2977
02:39:56,100 --> 02:39:56,940
It's just thinking about it.

2978
02:39:56,940 --> 02:39:57,780
But who cares?

2979
02:39:57,780 --> 02:39:58,600
Well, you're only saying that

2980
02:39:58,719 --> 02:40:06,700
because I'm doing it for you.

2981
02:40:06,700 --> 02:40:07,940
Ooh, this looks cool.

2982
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:21,989
101 damage, holy shit.

2983
02:40:21,989 --> 02:40:23,030
I don't, you know what?

2984
02:40:23,030 --> 02:40:24,030
I've brought this up before.

2985
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:28,270
I truly do not understand how you are an impatient gamer

2986
02:40:28,270 --> 02:40:30,190
that hates all this dialogue and stuff

2987
02:40:30,190 --> 02:40:31,870
and you're like the least patient

2988
02:40:31,870 --> 02:40:35,530
and yet you love House Flipper and you love cleaning game

2989
02:40:35,530 --> 02:40:37,569
and you love like viscera cleanup detail.

2990
02:40:38,850 --> 02:40:40,829
Rebuttal time.

2991
02:40:40,829 --> 02:40:44,149
So if I opened up this game

2992
02:40:44,190 --> 02:40:48,639
and the game was called connect cables to each other

2993
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:50,760
and I knew exactly what I was getting into,

2994
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:53,399
I'm gonna connect cables to walls.

2995
02:40:53,399 --> 02:40:54,840
That's the game, it's a puzzle game.

2996
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:56,440
It's a game where you connect cables.

2997
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:59,079
If I'm into that shit, I will play that cable game.

2998
02:40:59,079 --> 02:40:59,920
Sounds awesome.

2999
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:01,120
House Flipper is a game where you know

3000
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:03,600
you're gonna go in there and clean and paint.

3001
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:05,440
House Flipper is not a game that starts out

3002
02:41:05,440 --> 02:41:07,200
when you have like a machete in your hand

3003
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:09,360
and it's like, oh, hey, welcome to House Flipper.

3004
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:10,959
Go slaughter people.

3005
02:41:10,959 --> 02:41:13,680
If this game includes things from other games you do like,

3006
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:15,879
like if you loved fishing games and you find out,

3007
02:41:15,879 --> 02:41:19,379
oh wait, this game also has fishing.

3008
02:41:19,379 --> 02:41:20,219
Okay, so.

3009
02:41:20,219 --> 02:41:21,379
You just hate that.

3010
02:41:21,379 --> 02:41:23,139
No, no, because look, there's a difference

3011
02:41:23,139 --> 02:41:24,940
between like a game having fishing

3012
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:27,379
and a game having drag a cable across the room

3013
02:41:27,379 --> 02:41:29,040
to pad 10 minutes onto the game.

3014
02:41:30,270 --> 02:41:33,030
This is not a puzzle that people think is cool.

3015
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:35,270
It's just, it's just here.

3016
02:41:35,270 --> 02:41:37,299
It's just here.

3017
02:41:37,299 --> 02:41:38,739
It's nothing, it doesn't do anything.

3018
02:41:38,739 --> 02:41:40,620
It's just like, this is just here now.

3019
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:42,219
There's not a fishing mini game

3020
02:41:42,219 --> 02:41:45,659
where I get achievements for getting the big mouth baths.

3021
02:41:45,659 --> 02:41:47,180
Okay, so you want the big mouth.

3022
02:41:47,180 --> 02:41:48,780
I'm just saying like, if I go in a fishing game

3023
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:50,260
and I'm doing brrrr and I pull it up

3024
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:52,440
and it's like, this bath was 16 pounds.

3025
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:55,360
That like has weight behind it to me.

3026
02:41:55,360 --> 02:41:56,739
We are just walking around this room

3027
02:41:56,739 --> 02:42:09,129
looking to drag a cable to the other thing to plug it in.

3028
02:42:09,129 --> 02:42:11,790
Okay, if there was like a, if there was mines,

3029
02:42:11,790 --> 02:42:14,409
if there was like little mineral deposits everywhere,

3030
02:42:14,409 --> 02:42:17,719
I would not, I would be happy about that.

3031
02:42:17,719 --> 02:42:23,129
Oh, cool, here's some, here's some ore, like ding, boom.

3032
02:42:23,129 --> 02:42:24,569
Why would you be happy about that?

3033
02:42:24,569 --> 02:42:26,069
I wouldn't be happy about it, but it's like,

3034
02:42:26,069 --> 02:42:28,829
it's not just like, hey, go walk around the building

3035
02:42:28,829 --> 02:42:30,069
and drag a cable around it.

3036
02:42:30,069 --> 02:42:32,389
Like, no, it's different.

3037
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:39,299
Okay, well, we gotta drag one more cable.

3038
02:42:39,299 --> 02:42:40,899
There's one more thing I think here

3039
02:42:40,899 --> 02:42:42,819
that needs a cable in it.

3040
02:42:42,819 --> 02:42:44,620
And I think I'm gonna leave this one up to you.

3041
02:42:44,620 --> 02:42:46,180
No, don't.

3042
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:47,340
I think it's right, oh no,

3043
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:54,959
there's like an inhibitor above us.

3044
02:42:54,959 --> 02:42:57,600
Look, I'm sure that there's probably gonna be.

3045
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:00,639
There'll be a thing in our inventory

3046
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:02,920
that's like electrical boxes connected,

3047
02:43:02,920 --> 02:43:07,700
like two out of 58, right?

3048
02:43:07,700 --> 02:43:12,610
I'm, let's see if it's there.

3049
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:13,729
Well, you haven't connected any,

3050
02:43:13,729 --> 02:43:20,399
so it's probably not in your inventory.

3051
02:43:20,399 --> 02:43:22,559
I mean, I've been, I've been connecting them.

3052
02:43:22,559 --> 02:43:24,000
There's lock picks needed up here.

3053
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:29,659
Like, there's a whole bunch of things you could be doing.

3054
02:43:29,659 --> 02:43:36,260
You know, I'm looting stuff, I'm picking up shoes.

3055
02:43:36,260 --> 02:43:38,629
I can't grab those, why not?

3056
02:43:38,629 --> 02:43:44,659
Are they too big?

3057
02:43:44,659 --> 02:43:52,909
Oh, shit, just do it.

3058
02:43:52,909 --> 02:43:53,750
Do what?

3059
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:54,989
Just do the mission.

3060
02:43:54,989 --> 02:43:59,649
I'm doing it, and for the record, I'm hating it.

3061
02:43:59,649 --> 02:44:00,850
But at least I'm doing it.

3062
02:44:00,850 --> 02:44:03,350
Okay, I just wanna make sure

3063
02:44:03,350 --> 02:44:05,590
we're very clear what you just said.

3064
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:06,790
I know what I just said.

3065
02:44:06,790 --> 02:44:08,790
I'm just surprised that you, someone,

3066
02:44:08,790 --> 02:44:11,350
I see, I don't like visceral cleanup detail.

3067
02:44:11,350 --> 02:44:13,469
I think that house flipper is fucking boring.

3068
02:44:13,469 --> 02:44:14,950
I hated that.

3069
02:44:14,950 --> 02:44:16,729
No, what?

3070
02:44:16,729 --> 02:44:20,659
You hated visceral cleanup detail?

3071
02:44:20,659 --> 02:44:23,069
Yes, that was the whole premise

3072
02:44:23,069 --> 02:44:25,549
of why you wanted to play with me,

3073
02:44:25,549 --> 02:44:27,270
because you knew I would hate it.

3074
02:44:27,270 --> 02:44:29,270
But like that, it's like,

3075
02:44:29,270 --> 02:44:31,510
it scratches like a dopamine itch

3076
02:44:32,030 --> 02:44:33,350
to like clean up stuff and move stuff

3077
02:44:33,350 --> 02:44:35,229
and make things look nice.

3078
02:44:35,229 --> 02:44:37,819
Yeah, I bet you like kitchens real clean, right?

3079
02:44:37,819 --> 02:44:39,299
Actually, it is.

3080
02:44:39,299 --> 02:44:41,239
It's actually very clean.

3081
02:44:41,239 --> 02:44:44,479
I contribute a lot of cleaning, a lot, okay?

3082
02:44:44,479 --> 02:44:49,079
Yes.

3083
02:44:49,079 --> 02:44:50,500
I'm not buying it.

3084
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:51,700
What do you mean you don't buy it?

3085
02:44:51,700 --> 02:44:54,420
You don't buy it that I like clean my own places?

3086
02:44:54,420 --> 02:44:56,399
The tone that you just took.

3087
02:44:56,399 --> 02:44:58,280
For a second I thought you were talking about the tub.

3088
02:44:58,280 --> 02:45:00,280
The tub, do you do the tub too?

3089
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:05,100
Look, okay, we gotta get this to go somewhere.

3090
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:06,739
And I opened this door

3091
02:45:06,739 --> 02:45:08,299
and I don't know where this goes.

3092
02:45:08,299 --> 02:45:09,700
I don't know where any of the things are.

3093
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:11,260
There's no like objective markers

3094
02:45:11,260 --> 02:45:14,459
from where they're supposed to be.

3095
02:45:14,459 --> 02:45:15,299
There's like a sub,

3096
02:45:15,299 --> 02:45:18,629
oh, there's a substation basement down here.

3097
02:45:18,629 --> 02:45:21,569
Oh, there it is.

3098
02:45:21,569 --> 02:45:23,360
Where's this one going?

3099
02:45:23,360 --> 02:45:24,520
Up here to the two, right?

3100
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:26,520
Oh, no, this one's gotta go to the three.

3101
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:27,360
Oh, right.

3102
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:33,559
That's the number three.

3103
02:45:33,559 --> 02:45:35,700
Gotta come over here.

3104
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:38,100
Now I'm taking it through the vent.

3105
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:40,540
Shit, watch out, zombies.

3106
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:43,700
Yeah, dodge, dodge, watch out.

3107
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:48,219
Grenade out, grenade great.

3108
02:45:48,219 --> 02:45:58,239
Watch out, whoa, parkour, got it.

3109
02:45:58,239 --> 02:46:04,799
What is the point of this?

3110
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,540
I need help.

3111
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:08,819
Okay, so from there, you need to walk.

3112
02:46:08,819 --> 02:46:12,379
If that's three, I don't think this is correct

3113
02:46:12,379 --> 02:46:13,219
because this is yellow.

3114
02:46:13,219 --> 02:46:14,819
You have something plugged into three.

3115
02:46:14,819 --> 02:46:16,620
That one is not correct.

3116
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:20,010
Let me get that off.

3117
02:46:20,010 --> 02:46:21,329
And I need you to...

3118
02:46:21,329 --> 02:46:22,969
So this has to go to two.

3119
02:46:22,969 --> 02:46:26,090
Two is over here.

3120
02:46:26,090 --> 02:46:26,930
Honey.

3121
02:46:26,930 --> 02:46:30,569
Two goes to two, stop.

3122
02:46:30,569 --> 02:46:34,069
I think I gotta climb up here.

3123
02:46:34,069 --> 02:46:40,350
And then, one is wrong too, I think.

3124
02:46:40,350 --> 02:46:41,940
Really?

3125
02:46:41,940 --> 02:46:42,760
Where is three?

3126
02:46:42,760 --> 02:46:43,620
Can you go stand by three

3127
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:45,020
so I at least know where the fuck I'm going?

3128
02:46:45,180 --> 02:46:50,379
One is connected to one, I think that's right.

3129
02:46:50,379 --> 02:46:51,219
I'm gonna scream.

3130
02:46:51,219 --> 02:46:52,780
Does one have to connect to two and then two to three?

3131
02:46:52,780 --> 02:46:54,100
Don't scream.

3132
02:46:54,100 --> 02:46:55,299
It won't even pick up and it won't be funny.

3133
02:46:55,299 --> 02:47:00,540
You're gonna hurt your voice.

3134
02:47:00,540 --> 02:47:02,420
How do I release?

3135
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:05,659
Yes, you plugged three into three?

3136
02:47:05,659 --> 02:47:08,430
Yeah, now we got one more to go.

3137
02:47:08,430 --> 02:47:10,680
Okay, so I have this one here.

3138
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:12,280
So where does this one go now?

3139
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:14,639
This one goes to two.

3140
02:47:14,639 --> 02:47:17,200
And two is up there?

3141
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:19,819
How do I let this go?

3142
02:47:19,819 --> 02:47:20,659
Hold F.

3143
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:25,559
Okay, so if you grab two and put it into two,

3144
02:47:25,559 --> 02:47:27,719
does that do it?

3145
02:47:27,719 --> 02:47:29,879
I mean, I gotta go put it into two

3146
02:47:29,879 --> 02:47:31,000
because you're not doing it.

3147
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,120
Yeah, well, I had to let it go

3148
02:47:32,120 --> 02:47:34,329
because it was all tangled up.

3149
02:47:34,329 --> 02:47:38,059
I don't know where two is, I forget where two is.

3150
02:47:38,059 --> 02:47:40,059
I think it's down there in that corner.

3151
02:47:40,059 --> 02:47:52,250
Two, wait, does it show up on the map?

3152
02:47:52,250 --> 02:47:54,059
What?

3153
02:47:54,059 --> 02:47:57,579
You holding onto it and using it to swing?

3154
02:47:57,579 --> 02:47:59,489
Yeah.

3155
02:47:59,489 --> 02:48:04,489
I'll go find two, hold on.

3156
02:48:04,489 --> 02:48:07,069
Do you remember if it was up or down?

3157
02:48:07,069 --> 02:48:09,430
I think it's over there in that corner.

3158
02:48:09,430 --> 02:48:11,540
I'm stuck.

3159
02:48:11,540 --> 02:48:13,190
The game just crashed.

3160
02:48:13,190 --> 02:48:14,030
Did it?

3161
02:48:14,030 --> 02:48:19,979
Yeah.

3162
02:48:19,979 --> 02:48:25,770
Oh, that was fun dying light session.

3163
02:48:25,770 --> 02:48:28,579
Are you done?

3164
02:48:28,579 --> 02:48:29,780
You know, I'm just saying

3165
02:48:29,780 --> 02:48:31,979
I don't think your game crashed.

3166
02:48:31,979 --> 02:48:33,260
I swear to God it did.
