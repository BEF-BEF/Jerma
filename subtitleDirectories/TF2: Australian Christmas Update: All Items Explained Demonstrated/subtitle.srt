00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,419
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Australian Christmas Update.

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:10,060
I know I should be eating my words right now because a couple of days ago I made a video

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,019
complaining, talking about how we haven't seen a update or a weapon in a long time,

4
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:21,179
and here we go, we got like 10 new items to play with. And like in previous fashion of my other

5
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:25,899
update coverage, I'm going to give you every single weapon in a real gameplay situation,

6
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,420
talk about it, give you all the details, talk about what I think about the item.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,039
So let's get started right now, starting with the Engineer. The first Engineer Unlockable you can

8
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:42,280
get is something called the Pomsen 6000, which is a shotgun replacement, does not require ammo,

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,920
projectiles penetrate enemy targets, projectile cannot be deflected, on hit, victim loses 10%

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,799
medigun charge and victim loses 20% cloak, so it's an anti-spy, anti-uber item. So if you want to

11
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,759
compare this to a different item, this is essentially just a jacked up righteous bison,

12
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,280
and I wasn't really a fan of the bison, but for some reason, I don't know why,

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,299
I actually like this weapon, I think it's actually very well done. Probably going to see a nerf

14
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,900
because of all the discharging, the 10% medigun charge thing, that's a little over the top,

15
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,090
but we will see what they do, I recommend you get this item ASAP. Now let's talk about the new wrench,

16
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:31,480
the Eureka Effect. On alt fire, teleport to spawn just like this. There is no recharge time on this

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:38,200
guys, you can do this a hundred times in a row. The downside is you cannot carry buildings anymore,

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,560
which is a huge downside. I guess a big upside of this weapon though is say goodbye to back capping,

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,079
spy capping, scout capping, if you know somebody got behind you, you can just teleport right back

20
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,200
to the first point. Also it needs to be said you do not have to go to the resupply when you teleport,

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,819
you just instantly get 200 metal. It's got some great novelty features, but in my opinion,

22
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:06,700
I'm not going to really use this item a whole lot because I really need to move buildings,

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,659
I'm so addicted to it now I have to do it. If you're one of those people that doesn't really care

24
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,979
about moving your buildings around, then by all means use this wrench, you will love it.

25
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:22,490
Moving on to the Pyro, now the Pyro got three new items, the first is the Flogistinator or the

26
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,099
Flogistinator, I'm not sure, it's one of those two. And just like the Soda Popper, when the Soda Popper

27
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:35,460
came out, there's a new mechanic called the Oomph Bar, which fills as you do damage. It only fills

28
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,300
if you do fire damage, this will not fill from shotgun shots, I've already tried it. So essentially

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,740
what's going to happen is once you fill this bar, you're going to right click to taunt,

30
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,860
and that is going to give you crits and refill all your health instantly. The major downsides of

31
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,699
course is you cannot compression blast and you cannot get random critical hits. And as you can

32
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:05,460
see on the screen, this weapon is ridiculous. It is incredibly powerful, if it's in the right hands,

33
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,819
you can do a lot of damage. Now a lot of people think this is going to replace the Backburner

34
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:16,740
as the new heavy-hitting, dominating flamethrower, and they might be true, but I think that a lot of

35
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:23,060
people are still going to use the Backburner because of the new secondary. That new secondary

36
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,379
is the Mann Melter 3600ZX. It is a flare gun replacement, a lot of people were curious as to

37
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:34,580
what the hell this thing actually was. It is a flare gun replacement, doesn't require any ammo,

38
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,180
cannot be deflected, and if you put somebody out like this, you hold down right click, you are going

39
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,699
to get one guaranteed crit shot like that. This is going to be great with weapons like the Backburner

40
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:52,099
because you can save that compression blast on a teammate by using this item. Now this weapon does

41
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:57,460
not crit under any other circumstances. If you hit somebody that's already on fire with this item,

42
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,139
it will not crit them, it's just going to do normal flare gun damage. The final item for the

43
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:09,699
Pyro in this update is the third degree. It is a new melee item, and this is a weird one guys.

44
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,139
This is kind of one of those gimmicky weapons that a lot of people aren't going to use,

45
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,139
because essentially what it does, see it's supposed to hit every single person that's

46
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:23,540
connected by medibeams, and right there I guess I hit all three people, but who really cares?

47
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,139
If you're going to get that close to somebody, you might as well Extinguisher kill them,

48
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:33,379
or light them on fire. The only real reason I could see why this would be useful is if you crit

49
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:39,220
somebody, you smash crit one of the medics, and it kills like a line of three people.

50
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,660
So moving on to the Scouty Scout got one item, gonna cover it real quickly, the Wrap Assassin.

51
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,699
It is a reskin of the Sandman, and the only difference is when you hit somebody with the

52
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,180
ball, it puts a bleed effect on them so they don't get stunned, which is kind of hard getting used

53
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,019
to, because I'm used to hitting somebody and having them boing, stand still for a couple of

54
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:04,100
seconds, which is a big downside, and the other big downside is this has a minus 70% damage penalty.

55
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,899
So physically going up and whacking somebody with this thing is an awful idea.

56
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:14,579
I guess the only real good upside is you don't get the minus health like you do on the Sandman.

57
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,660
Regardless of that though, I don't think anyone's going to make the switch to this weapon

58
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:26,250
anytime soon. Moving on to the Spy who got arguably the best item in this update, he got the

59
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:33,689
Spycicle. Backstab turns victim into ice, silent killer, no attack noise from backstabs, and the

60
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:40,009
big ridiculous, I'm so happy about this, this is my new default knife, you are immune to fire damage

61
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:45,930
for the first couple seconds, but it destroys the knife in the process. So if you get lit on fire,

62
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,449
I'll show you here in a minute, you do not light on fire and you do not take any damage, so it is

63
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:57,050
huge. Not to mention backstabbing people and having them turn into these stone ice sculptures,

64
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,410
it's so awesome. That is a downside though, because that reveals your position, people are going to

65
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,970
know there's a Spy around. If you turn around and see two ice sculptures or your two best friends,

66
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,100
you're going to start looking around. So here is another example of how the fireproof mechanism

67
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,500
works. I'm going to be up here, a Pyro is going to come outside, spray me, I'm not going to light

68
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,139
on fire. See right there, I should have lit on fire, but I didn't. My knife got destroyed instead,

69
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,660
and it takes 15 seconds for it to come back. After 15 seconds, I can go back to what I was doing

70
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:36,649
before. The final item in this update is something called the Holiday Punch. It is a new heavy melee

71
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:42,410
unlockable, and I left it for last because it really is just ridiculous. It's just the stupidest

72
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,439
item I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of fun. So basically the mechanic is,

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,639
when you crit somebody with these gloves on, it's going to force them to do the laugh taunt.

74
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,879
And right here, here's a funny example of how it can actually be useful. See, I crit that guy,

75
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,129
hit him from behind, it's just, I can't even begin to explain this item. Anytime you hit somebody from

76
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:08,810
behind, they're going to start laughing, or any time you crit them. And crits don't do any damage.

77
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,699
If you crit somebody, it won't hurt them at all, they just start laughing at you. It is like just,

78
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:19,139
I can't, I am at a loss, but it is a lot of fun to mess around with. And if somebody else is wearing

79
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,699
these gloves, and you punch them, it doesn't matter if they're in front of you, behind you,

80
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,819
next to you, if you just touch them with these gloves on, they will do a laugh taunt at you.

81
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:34,170
That is going to conclude the video, but before I leave, I need to say this.

82
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:42,500
You can only get the Spy Knife, the Heavy Gloves, and the Scout Wrapping Paper. You can only get

83
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,379
them in nice crates, or by using slot tokens to craft. That is the only way you can get those

84
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:54,360
items. You can't buy them, and they don't drop. That potentially could change in the next couple

85
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,000
of days, or even the next couple of weeks. It definitely will change, but as of right now,

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,939
you can only get them through those means. So thanks everybody, hope you guys enjoyed,

87
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:08,019
happy holidays again, and I'll see you guys next time. Take care everybody.
