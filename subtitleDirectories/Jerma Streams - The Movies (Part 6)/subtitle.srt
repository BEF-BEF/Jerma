1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:16,620
Good afternoon. How are you? Hope you're having a swell day. What's up? Not much. This is unprecedented

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:27,640
amounts of early. We're fairly early, at least today, because we have to be. I've had to be

3
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:37,460
early over the last few streams for various reasons. How's Otto? Otto is good. I had him checked.

4
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:49,899
He just has some dry skin, so he has a special shampoo now that Kim and I have to use for a

5
00:00:49,899 --> 00:01:00,060
couple weeks. Yeah, it's kind of like a dog lotion, kind of, but he'll be just fine.

6
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,469
This is the first time he's ever been in Vegas, and it's really dry and really,

7
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:12,069
really irritating weather out here. It's like 100 degrees. He's not really used to it, so

8
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:16,329
he's been very itchy. I wanted to make sure nothing was wrong with him, so

9
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:24,040
he's good. And the reason why we started like an hour or two early today is because I have to

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,959
get on a plane. I got to get out of here. I've talked about it a little bit, but going to

11
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:39,560
visit family and going to put like triple time into this stream that's coming up here.

12
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:51,319
I will be gone for just over just about a week. I'm going to be gone for like a week,

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,939
but this is planned. At least the family stuff, because I'm not going to be seeing a lot of my

14
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:09,449
family members for a very, very long time. There's a lot of movement in my family and

15
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,650
siblings and relatives. I probably won't be seeing them again for a long, long, long time.

16
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,729
So we decided we would do a little thing, and I also decided that why not take the

17
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:26,169
opportunity to really, really put a bunch of work into this upcoming dunk tank carnival stream.

18
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:38,949
So as of next week, I will have that stream in motion. So I will be away from the stream,

19
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:45,419
but I won't be away from the stream, if you know what I mean, in a live sense.

20
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:53,539
And speaking of streams, I'm going to wait until people triple in here, because the last stream

21
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:02,520
before Deep Rock Galactic, we had a little bit of a problem. There was a crash.

22
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:15,849
I lost a bunch of progress on the movies, but guess what I did? I got it! I went back and I

23
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:21,099
finished it, and I did it. And it's exported, and I have it right now. So we can watch it

24
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:27,379
before we do anything else. Also today, there are a bunch of mods installed, so I don't know

25
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:32,250
how stable the game is going to be. I have a shitload of new characters, a bunch of new sets.

26
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:41,669
We're going to try to make something in the time period that we have. So I hope to be able

27
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,710
to... I should be able to be live for about five hours. Maybe a little bit more. Maybe a

28
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:53,349
little less, depending on how much Kim is trying to get me to pack and get ready,

29
00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:02,550
because she was like, hey, are you ready? Are you packed? No? Well, did you check in? No? Well,

30
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:10,599
what are you doing? She's not just like that, too. And Otto... Italics is going to be

31
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,459
dog-sitting for us, because he's going to be sticking around. So that's really nice of him.

32
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:26,149
Really good. For an ancient game, this is going to go well. I have tried a few things,

33
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,879
so it is... it does work. I've seen the characters, and I can't wait to use them.

34
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:36,949
This is going to be such a joke of a stream, because I'm going to just be wanting to put

35
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:42,810
characters in where they don't belong. I have a plan for what I want to make for the first movie,

36
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,639
and it's going to ruin everything, but it's okay. So let me just... let me be back in,

37
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,319
like, one second. I want to move something over here, and then we will watch the E3

38
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:33,240
presentation video. I'll be right back. Oh shit, the mic was muted. Are you guys ready?

39
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:42,699
Here it comes. It exported at like... they all export at 30 frames a second, or like 25 frames

40
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:49,370
a second, so it might... it's a little sloppy, but I got it. And there's a dog, too. All right,

41
00:05:49,370 --> 00:06:38,899
here we go. You ready? Three, two, one, action. Wait, what? Wait, what's wrong? What's wrong?

42
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:52,410
What's wrong? No sound? There's no sound. Oh fuck, okay. Can you hear it? Can you hear it?

43
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,930
You can hear it, right? Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise. You can hear that,

44
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:14,170
right? All right, all right. And three, two, one. Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise

45
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:22,149
and welcome our president and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strongs.

46
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,310
Hey, that's who I'm talking about. Welcome to E3, everybody. We're so happy to be here. We

47
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,629
are beyond excited to show you two new releases upcoming in our catalog of Oh My God Entertainment

48
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:52,550
games. That's Osmond, that's Michael, and that's Gary, the three of us. So excited for you to be here

49
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,389
at this E3 event. I can hear that. I can hear something over here. That's me, I'm sorry.

50
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,829
Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone up. Turn the phone up. You're gonna come to

51
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:11,589
E3 and try to come to my conference? Fuck you. That's two phones.

52
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,629
Come on, get up there then. 42%. What are you gonna do?

53
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:39,210
World premiere. Don't die on me. Die on me. Come on. Co-captain. You were my co-pilot.

54
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,350
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature. I don't know what it could be. Possibly an

55
00:09:01,350 --> 00:11:02,090
organic compound. What is that? Thank you for joining us at this year's E3.

56
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,210
We look forward to seeing you next year, where we cancel half these games,

57
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,649
and the other half are dumbed down to a point where you're not gonna have them.

58
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:16,419
Oh also sorry to say, we have canceled from last year,

59
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:20,419
Booger Eaters 3. I decided it was not part of the planning.

60
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,299
I had to end it. I had to just end it somehow. I don't know, some of the audio was in like

61
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:44,009
the wrong places. In the very beginning when he's like, I, that's who I'm talking to.

62
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:51,110
I don't know why the first like three seconds has cut out. But look, I salvaged it. I

63
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,940
actually salvaged it. I'm happy. I was so sad two or three nights ago. I was so depressed.

64
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,419
But, why don't we just transition from there? Does someone just give a hundred bucks?

65
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:16,409
That phylactery lich just gave a hundred dollars. Thank you so much for the hundred bucks.

66
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:22,919
They say bravo. Well we have, there's more to come, because today there's,

67
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:30,500
I, you thought that may have been off the rails. Just wait until like, wait until R2D2

68
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,659
shows up in one of these. I, I don't know what's gonna happen. The game might break

69
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,299
over and over again, but it'll be worth it, I think, at least to play with it.

70
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,320
So, thank you so much phylactery lich. It's a lot of fucking money.

71
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:55,659
Why don't I open the game? Oh my god. And 20 community subs. Holy shit.

72
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:10,220
Uh, thank you Herbert1234 for the also huge amount of money. Thank you so much.

73
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:20,360
Both of you. All of you. Two huge monetary drops right now. Thank you.

74
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:36,600
Let's see what we can come up with. Thank you guys. So I have it saved exactly right after

75
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:46,679
the release of E3 presentation. Oh my god. Phylactery lich. 50 dollars from phylactery lich.

76
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:55,340
Uh, I will not be upstaged in this manner. Well that's another 50 dollars. Thank you.

77
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:03,850
And then right after that, back in gave 50 dollars. Movie sucks, Kappa. And we got acid base.

78
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,860
I don't want, I don't want you guys to see the new sets. Because some of them are fucking

79
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,960
hilarious. And they're just blasting acid base right now. I didn't do this.

80
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,179
But back to back, both of you, thank you for the 50 dollars. Dead-O 15 community subs.

81
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,679
Thank you guys. Thank you for all the fucking huge amounts of money. All the community subs.

82
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:37,980
This is ridiculous. Thank you. More community subs. Make it louder.

83
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:50,120
Oh, all right. Let's make a movie. Oh my god. What the fuck is happening right now.

84
00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:01,990
Phylactery lich. Again, a hundred dollars. Shut up and take my money. Love you, Germany.

85
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,090
I will shut up and take your money. But first I'm going to say something.

86
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,340
That's a shitload of money. Thank you for it.

87
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:21,480
That's 250 bucks in 10 minutes. I'm going to be eating this steak tonight.

88
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:32,809
Thank you so much guys. And then camp, Karen. Camp F Karen. Five community subs.

89
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:44,789
We've got a little train going here. Thank you guys. Just wait. Just wait till you see

90
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:53,269
what happens here. The first thing we're going to do. So let's get a new script going.

91
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,210
Where's my script writing office? This isn't pretty loud though. Why is this so loud?

92
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:13,480
I'm like drowning myself out. There we go. That's a little better. That's a little better.

93
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:27,779
Okay. Now I can hear myself talking. All right. Script supervisor office. We're going to make

94
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,139
a new script and we're going to see just how much this works. We're going to do,

95
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,929
we're going to do a Batman movie. Uh, Batman and Robin versus Mr. Freeze.

96
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:50,889
And maybe some other cameo. There it is. Come on. I don't even know what the hell it is.

97
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:59,799
There it is. Okay. Advanced movie maker. We're going to call this one, um,

98
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,839
Batman. Should I call it Batman or is that illegal? How about like, what if it's,

99
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:17,109
what if it's like a fan Batman? That makes it fine, right? Fan Batman and fan Robin.

100
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:30,220
They're just fans. How about in just, in how about that the movie just called

101
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:46,460
they're just fans. Rat man and Robin. No, but they're not rats. Okay. I'll show you.

102
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:51,579
So first of all, let's take a look at some of the new, uh, mods that we have here.

103
00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:00,470
We have Robin, we have Superman, Batman, and then I'm going to say this is the Burger King,

104
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,440
but that's like for, you know, should we do the Burger King one first? We do like the

105
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:19,029
Burger King King. We got R2D2. We have like Warcraft characters. There it is. There's like the

106
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:35,140
Iceman. Here's Darth Vader. I think I want to do the Burger King movie first. Yeah, that's

107
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:42,279
Batman and fan Batman and fan Robin versus fan Mr. Freeze. Make him gold.

108
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:57,529
Light bulb Vader. Yeah, I got Chewbacca. I don't even know what this is supposed to be.

109
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:08,230
There's no dick, right? All right. Good. Should I make the king? I think I'm going to do the king.

110
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's do a Burger King. Yeah, I think we're going to do a burger. We're going to do where

111
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,460
I got. I've got plenty of time. Don't worry. No, not burger alien. Okay. We need, uh,

112
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,529
this is the, this is the sneak king, right? Whatever his name is. What does his hair look

113
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:45,400
like? It's like, isn't it like blonde or brown? It's like this, right? That does not look

114
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:58,500
like the king. All right. Facial hair. That's just like closest it's going to get.

115
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:07,900
His hair is much different than this though. Holy shit. There it is. Okay. I got it. It's done.

116
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:17,480
There he is. There's the Burger King. Oh, it was just, all right. All right. All right.

117
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,769
We're good. Same, uh, hair color, right? Yeah, it's that. What color are the Burger King's

118
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:43,460
eyes? They're like green fan Burger King. Yeah. They're not red. No, this is fucked up.

119
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:53,700
Demonic Burger King. No, it can't be like that. There we go. That's better.

120
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:08,230
Okay. All right. So let's get you in that costume. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

121
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:23,619
All right. You're good. What happened to your hair? Why did his, why did his hair just turn

122
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:34,569
into a plastic bag from the grocery store? What the fuck just happened? Oh, his age went

123
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:44,549
all the way up. Okay. Okay. That's better. All right. We got that. We got our Burger King.

124
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:08,339
I'm protected. All right. We need, who else needs to be? This would be like a promotion,

125
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:16,470
right? This is going to be a promotional video. No, I gotta, hold on. I gotta,

126
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:32,650
I gotta protect myself here. Okay. I think that's, I think I'm more protected here.

127
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,700
Um, so what do I want you to see? Maybe just a couple of customers.

128
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,380
They always do like a DC. No, the Batman and Robin is later.

129
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:06,970
I don't have any other like McDonald's characters. Should this be a fan of Star

130
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:28,900
Wars promotion at a fan of the Burger King? No, I want, hold on. Why, why is this empty?

131
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:38,710
Why is it just an empty space? Why does this one not work? I think this one might be broken.

132
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,700
Oh yeah. We could do a clown. Yeah. Okay. We could do, but yeah, we're going to save our

133
00:23:50,700 --> 00:24:03,339
modern. We'll do a clown. Did I have any, I think I put some more. Okay. No, it's an angel.

134
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:18,390
Patient. What if they just said like, no, no, I can't do that. I'm a fan of Burger King.

135
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:26,359
Perfect. What's Burger King's colors? Red and, uh, red and yellow, right? Wait, what?

136
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:36,950
Burger King's colors are red and yellow? Just like McDonald's. Holy shit. That just

137
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:45,130
hit me like a ton of bricks right here. It's red and yellow. Wait, it's red, yellow and blue. Okay.

138
00:24:46,009 --> 00:25:15,579
That saves it. No yellow. The uniform is brown. This is just standard, standard waiter.

139
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:27,619
It's all right. There, you said brown, right? Sorry. We'll just like,

140
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:40,519
we'll YouTube their hair to be like Burger King. Okay. Hold on. What about

141
00:25:40,519 --> 00:26:03,940
just like cover him in tattoos. Evil Burger King. This is not an evil Burger King.

142
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:17,779
All right. That looks all right. This person's married. All right. Then let's also do,

143
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:24,970
uh, and because everybody knows that at Burger King, there are fucking ants everywhere.

144
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:37,059
So, holy shit. It's a Burger King ant. It's a burger. Is it a Burger King ant? I can't,

145
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,900
no. If you're, by the way, if you're a fan of Burger King, you know that like when we make

146
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:51,750
fans of Burger King, our fan restaurant has ants in it. There's a Burger King ant right here.

147
00:26:51,750 --> 00:27:05,220
Yellow and green, right? There it is. Which one, this one or this one? No, it's this one.

148
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:33,190
That's Burger King colors, right? It kind of close enough. This, this one, I like this one

149
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:40,839
too. It's like so ugly though. I don't think I can look at this. Make it a French fry ant

150
00:27:43,779 --> 00:28:01,140
like that. You like a French fry ant. Okay. And this is slick. Driscoll is already like

151
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:11,619
an interesting name, but I'm going to change it to the cashier and then French fry ant.

152
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:31,819
Okay. This is a, this is a comedy, obviously. All right. So we have our, our base here. So

153
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:38,220
we are going to go to a new place. This place is called, I know I have like a restaurant

154
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:47,799
somewhere. These are the new ones. Heaven, a hospital bedroom, hell, metropolitan subway,

155
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,319
city destroyed by volcano, which I mean, that would be, I mean, that's kind of makes sense.

156
00:28:55,829 --> 00:29:02,539
City destroyed. Oh, should I save that for Batman? Oh, here we go. Hit Pizzeria.

157
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:09,369
Pray that this works. So this is where the, we're at the, the burger, the fan restaurant.

158
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:22,460
Give money. Yeah. The King burger has to pay everybody. How much money is he given?

159
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:28,039
He's like an abusive boss.

160
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,259
I think I like that, but wait, hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is fine,

161
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:52,920
but we're not going to, it's not going to stay there. Undercover boss, burger king edition.

162
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:04,519
Wouldn't you just know who it is? Order. All right. Hold on. I got to think about this

163
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:13,289
under cover boss with the kid, with the, with the burger king. He's already here.

164
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,369
All right. Let's start with like a card writing. Maybe he's like doing the menu.

165
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:42,329
Let me see what this looks like. It's a birthday. Is he eating the pen? Why is he

166
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:57,210
putting the pen in his mouth? Sneaky. He's like the sneak king, right? That's not very

167
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:13,339
sneaky. Okay. I like that. I like that little look over his shoulder. That's sneaky. I like it.

168
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,980
It's staying. Okay. So sneak king, the sneaky for a minute. He's paying his employees.

169
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:29,349
He has to pay the aunt too. So that's important. Just like the start of a regular day,

170
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:34,359
pay phone, give money. Here we go.

171
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:52,250
Well, this does the same thing. It's like angry. You better step in food

172
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,579
and breathe in the walls. You better gross out at least two customers today.

173
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:14,630
Okay. So we can, we can cut these up. Let's open up with him

174
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:20,740
writing the letter, paying the employees, pizzeria. Okay.

175
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:44,539
All right. I look, I know that everyone's, everyone knows that this is going.

176
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:53,190
We don't even have to talk about it, but like we need to get there first.

177
00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:00,980
We need to get there first. So somebody has to come in to the store, enter,

178
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:13,849
uh, to, to enter. These can just be extras. Uh, they could just be,

179
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:27,740
it could be that Sandler don't matter. How's their costumes? Pizza.

180
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:42,089
All right. Let's check. Uh, let's get some costumes here. It's fine.

181
00:33:42,890 --> 00:34:02,299
And you need a costume too. Uh, this is all right. No, this is fine. All right.

182
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:08,699
They're like nursery rhyme twins somehow. Uh, that's how big we need them. They both enter

183
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:20,500
their matching clothes. And then we need a order at the window. There should be a drive-through as

184
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:40,619
well. Order a drink. Here we go. King doesn't need to be here, but, uh, you do. Let's see.

185
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,630
This is just a bartender.

186
00:34:53,380 --> 00:35:18,329
Why is Burger King a refuse? Burger King is a bar. Oh, this is so stupid.

187
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:56,260
Serve and press. You should do like tricks and stuff. You're going to do a trick. I like it.

188
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:06,300
Okay. I also need, is it like food? Eat food. Order food. There we go.

189
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:12,250
Oh, who's coughing.

190
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:33,400
Okay. So let's, the, the aunt. Okay. I'm going to compose myself here for a second.

191
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:47,019
So he's going to order because he's already up there. Yeah. I'll go back and add extras

192
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:53,139
in a second. The aunt can take the order. That's fine. There's gonna be something wrong

193
00:36:53,139 --> 00:37:00,550
with the food as things as the catalyst here. Uh, it doesn't matter. It is an extra.

194
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,639
Who did it? Who's the, what did I just do?

195
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:16,889
Oh, there's also, hold on. Let me, let me see if I can do this.

196
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:26,409
Props. How do I add props? Cause this is a shitload of props.

197
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:40,860
No, this is like the employer. Here we go. Okay. We need you. There you go. Sure. I get you. That's

198
00:37:40,860 --> 00:38:04,440
fine. Um, this is an evening gown. You go to Burger King in an evening gown. Classy night

199
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:32,760
tonight. What are you going to order? They have the same voice. People coughing in the

200
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:42,659
background. It's disgusting. This guy is naked.

201
00:38:52,599 --> 00:39:02,860
Hold on. Typical Burger King. I'm going to put a bunch of coughing and sneezing in the background.

202
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:44,650
Okay. That's fine. No, it's fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. All right. We're good.

203
00:39:49,480 --> 00:40:07,110
Okay. Next we're going to do pizzeria and there's going to be an issue with the food.

204
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:16,699
I need a serve or serve food, food, eat food. Okay. Here we go. Let's see what happens here.

205
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:27,539
Please tell me there's like a choke. The king is eating in his own restaurant and he fucking

206
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:54,579
chokes and dies. And then everybody panics. What? Wait, what? How did he choke? It's disgusting.

207
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,829
It's the assassination plot.

208
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:11,510
And then have him fall down. What is disgust?

209
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:32,760
Fork and knife at Burger King. Are we still eating it? That's much better. Okay. I like this.

210
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,800
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not the king. It's random people.

211
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:51,639
We should cut between like two or three people eating and like being disgusted.

212
00:41:52,519 --> 00:42:14,019
I'm going to change the camera angles. Is there a choke? No, there's fire choke.

213
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:31,460
Uh, food, eat food. Jesus. Okay. Let's get in there and do some camera work.

214
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:58,199
Let's go here. I need to go alt and then down. All right. This is good right here.

215
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:27,369
And then I want here. Let's see. Camera one, camera two. Let's see how that plays out.

216
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:59,530
Okay. Pretty good. Pretty good. Let's do another extra. We have,

217
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:09,860
did I do this person already? This is somebody else. Let's get in there.

218
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:22,099
Let's get in real close on this one. Or maybe, no, maybe not. If you like, like right here.

219
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:47,480
Okay. Why is people eating here? If it sucks this much?

220
00:44:47,480 --> 00:45:02,309
Is this the same person eating with the, oh, she's eating too.

221
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,409
Okay. Now we have to have a problem in the back where it's like,

222
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:37,590
what the fuck is going on back here? This is going to be like an intense talk.

223
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:51,260
Three-way conversation in the back. No, baby. Bartender cleaning. Let's add this.

224
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:59,820
Holy shit. Even more money came in. I wasn't even paying attention.

225
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:09,590
Filactory Lich gave another hundred dollars. This is gross. Keep doing it.

226
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,429
And my bank called me and asked if everything was all right. I told them I was giving money

227
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:31,260
to a man I watch play video games. They remain concerned. Thank you for the hundred

228
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:42,039
bucks. Hopefully everything's all right. That's a lot of money.

229
00:46:52,519 --> 00:47:01,239
All right. Let's go. Wait, why is he cleaning? Why is he tending here?

230
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:15,139
Somebody said this might be slander. It's not. This is not Burger King.

231
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:18,579
This is not. I'm going to make that really clear. This is not Burger King.

232
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:44,179
I'm going to change the name of this. No, it's not. It's not. This is not that.

233
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:48,420
I made that really clear. I'm a huge fan and this is my shitty restaurant.

234
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:07,320
All right. Don't worry. I'll fix it. Ready? Watch this. I'll fix it.

235
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:22,780
Everything's going to be fixed. No, I don't like that.

236
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:56,679
This is the real Burger King. He's like not even here. He's somewhere else.

237
00:48:56,679 --> 00:49:13,989
I told you. This is a fake Burger King. You got me all paranoid.

238
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:33,269
Are we going to have to change it? You're going to fucking jail.

239
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:41,989
All right. Well, this is fine. This is the real Burger King

240
00:49:41,989 --> 00:50:14,599
and he's not involved. Back to the pizzeria. All right. We have to have exit horror.

241
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:37,050
Wait, why is it like that? How horrifying. All right. Walk and talk. Let's see.

242
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:47,000
Heated argument. They sneak out without paying.

243
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:13,769
Okay. Angry. Angry, angry, angry. Let's try this.

244
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:29,800
That's not very heated. I would not classify this as heated.

245
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:53,579
Fight. Is there like a not extreme? Oh, it's ready fist fight.

246
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:27,380
A constant conflict. Burger conflict. There's always conflict. Is there argue?

247
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:40,889
How about conversation? Burger talk? Oh, what the fuck is that?

248
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:58,329
Oh, it's just the same scene from before except now he's doing it on the other side.

249
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:19,690
Holy shit. Phylactery lich is up to 400 bucks. These are the last bits. I want the next badge.

250
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,849
Don't worry about my money, Jeremiah. I'm set. I just wanted to share some with you

251
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:26,969
since you've been watching. I've been watching you for so long. Much love. Well, thank you

252
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:32,900
so much. That's an astronomical amount of money to give anybody. So thanks for the

253
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:51,750
400 fucking dollars. Hopefully your bank doesn't call you anymore. This is fine.

254
00:53:51,750 --> 00:54:06,059
We need those extras to get out because everyone's leaving. Is this the only option

255
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:27,000
I have? Yeah, it is. Making a deal. Crystal ball. Is this like in the future? Is he looking

256
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:45,369
into a crystal ball? Have somebody choke and then go to sleep. That's not a bad scene to

257
00:54:45,369 --> 00:55:20,019
put over here. Maybe somebody in the bathroom. Is there like a comedy chase in the bathroom?

258
00:55:20,019 --> 00:55:53,210
No. Dilemma. Okay, that's what I want. Hold on. No, it doesn't exist. I'm gonna go down here.

259
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:56,780
Ghost Kung Fu.

260
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:26,820
Okay, well.

261
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:39,659
Hold on. Feature. What? Someone smokes a cigarette and dies.

262
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:32,420
This doesn't make any sense though. This like can't be here. All right, so then he's gonna

263
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:53,260
knock. All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Comedy chase. Tired. That looks so dumb.

264
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:41,800
I like this one. Okay. We need more people to come into the restaurant.

265
00:59:46,340 --> 01:00:08,139
Okay, this one. Let's go back to, we need like a couple of a little finale here.

266
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:31,559
Enter flowers. Enter scanner. Somebody walks in with like a health inspector's scanner.

267
01:00:31,559 --> 01:01:05,110
All right, I need another actor. Who's not in this? Yeah, and he finds the ant.

268
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:13,639
No, Adam Sandler was in it in the beginning. What looks the most like a,

269
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:38,179
no, no, no. This sound is probably the best. All right, he's gotta change out of these clothes.

270
01:01:44,579 --> 01:02:00,789
No, that makes no sense. Here we go. R-T. No, it shouldn't be R. All right, he comes in.

271
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:17,139
No, we're gonna clean all this up in editing. Don't worry. And is it gonna be a confrontation

272
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:31,449
between him and the ant? He's gonna go in with the back. Maybe order food? Maybe he orders

273
01:02:31,449 --> 01:02:38,920
food and he's like, what the fuck is this? Should he slip on a banana peel and be like

274
01:02:38,920 --> 01:03:15,900
that? What's going on here? Reaction, calm, laughing, angry, angry. Watch your reaction.

275
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:46,070
Laugh. Or contempt. And then there it is. You don't just, you don't have to be in here.

276
01:03:53,590 --> 01:04:49,449
The health inspector's pissed. Okay, now we need, I gotta get these like characters out of this.

277
01:04:49,449 --> 01:05:16,869
I gotta, you have to be over here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What am I

278
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:43,380
thinking? What am I thinking? Am I insane? What am I talking about here? Where is it?

279
01:05:55,369 --> 01:06:28,539
No, no, wrong guy. That is so loud. Camera one's better. Okay. Is it like a three person

280
01:06:28,539 --> 01:07:30,260
fight? Two people attack. Here we go. What is horrific. Oh my God.

281
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:10,869
Okay. Well, these are the wrong characters. This has to be,

282
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:19,560
no, this is not an extra. No, no, no, no, no, no. Here. No, not Howard.

283
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:46,649
Okay. All right. All right. All right. No, we're done. We're done. We're done. I'm

284
01:08:47,130 --> 01:09:05,369
not gonna put this together. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, hold on. Let me, hold on a second. Okay.

285
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:35,779
Hold on. Hold on. I need to change something here. Okay. I, I'm sorry. That's like no fucking

286
01:09:35,779 --> 01:10:23,939
way. It's not a fucking chance in hell. You understand? You understand? Like I didn't want

287
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:27,539
this to be connected to any brand and that's what I'm doing. I want to make sure that

288
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:32,789
that's not what this is because that's not what my intention was. And now I'm like seeing

289
01:10:32,789 --> 01:10:52,170
like through the fucking rear view mirror here. Burger Palace is a real company. God

290
01:10:52,170 --> 01:11:16,680
gimme it. There's no fucking way that there's a burger pyramid. Okay. Absolutely zero chance.

291
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:43,000
There's no burger pyramid. There's a burger pyramid. Is that okay? Is that right? Am I,

292
01:11:43,000 --> 01:12:30,710
am I in trouble now? Okay. All right. See? It's not, it's not even close to the same person.

293
01:12:30,710 --> 01:13:10,789
All right. That's it. Okay. Back to normal. You're gonna get claimed for using the term

294
01:13:10,949 --> 01:13:30,380
French fry. Yellow end. Old man with crown. All right. I'll, that one's fine. I'll change that

295
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:39,210
one back. But I'm not, guys, I ain't fucking around right now. Where the hell were we?

296
01:13:39,210 --> 01:14:12,439
Back here? Someone's on the phone. This is perfect. Okay. I'm okay with this now.

297
01:14:13,369 --> 01:14:19,130
This is no longer, this is now, this is a pretend fucking little place. This was never

298
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:23,130
intended to be anything else ever. And I said that in the very beginning. Okay. Just

299
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:41,699
make sure everyone's clear. All right. Now the fuck he would never do this. That's right.

300
01:14:41,699 --> 01:15:12,500
Cause that's not the same person. All right. Now we gotta throw away. Give CPR to immediately.

301
01:15:12,500 --> 01:16:02,439
Dilemma. Tame. Moderate. Frenzied. Okay. Let's be easy here. Okay. Okay. We killed them.

302
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:38,180
We killed them. The police come in. Police come in and arrest them. And that's the end.

303
01:16:38,180 --> 01:17:31,460
Case closed. More ants. Okay. Why are they so happy? Okay. We gotta change this prop too.

304
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:50,100
That's like an old, kind of old rifle. Okay. And then you, I need, this is gonna be,

305
01:17:50,100 --> 01:18:12,810
now you're under arrest. Take photo. Investigation. Here we go. Double sneak.

306
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:26,060
Oh, who the fuck were they again? I have to do their costumes again.

307
01:18:28,789 --> 01:19:31,060
No, no, no. What, what are you doing? Okay. Good. Okay. Find rocking chair guard. Wait,

308
01:19:42,199 --> 01:20:00,390
why is he in a rocking chair? Disturbance. Feeble. High. Mood. Confused. Did he get like,

309
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:36,420
did he get like a shot? What? No, that makes no sense. All right. Well, how about happy?

310
01:20:36,420 --> 01:21:04,520
Same thing. Disturbance. Normal. Surprise. Angry. Angry. Okay. Here we go. No,

311
01:21:04,520 --> 01:22:07,500
that's don't work. Chat up. Throw away. Should he just drink poison? All right. And then

312
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:42,310
where is it? And that's it. It's just this one. No, he's not alive. I have to change it.

313
01:22:42,310 --> 01:23:16,890
No, not this one. Dog attack. Jump escape. No. Flank comedy. Wait, where is the alleyway again?

314
01:23:16,890 --> 01:24:07,979
Let me see. They're gonna throw him out. Quick. Here we go. Complete. That's gonna be so long.

315
01:24:07,979 --> 01:25:01,430
That's it. That's not it. Didn't he just drink poison? It's the ant.

316
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:32,579
We need an extra here like a police work. There we go.

317
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:11,210
I love the looking back. Can I make it? I'm not sure. Let's see if I can do it. I'm gonna try.

318
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:30,569
That's just, you're trying so hard to land on your back. You are jumping. You are trying

319
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:37,939
to hurt yourself. This is, please God try to hurt me as much as possible.

320
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:46,579
You're dead. You die from that, right? Do you die from that? I think you do. You might make,

321
01:26:46,579 --> 01:26:57,779
will you? I don't know. It would be, you'd change your whole life. Like you would change everything.

322
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:14,619
Okay. Good. Great. He doesn't even notice.

323
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:23,829
Cut to the hospital. Just cut immediately to the hospital.

324
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,170
Where's the hospital?

325
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:49,159
What is going on?

326
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:59,239
No, no, no. I'm thinking they could arrest him in the bed. How is this a hospital?

327
01:28:02,659 --> 01:28:37,750
Hospital bedroom. Slow start. No. Wake up. Wake up. Confused.

328
01:28:46,859 --> 01:28:51,180
It doesn't really look like a hospital. Just cut to a funeral of the ant.

329
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:57,319
That makes more sense. This is not, if this is a hospital it would be better.

330
01:28:57,319 --> 01:29:24,760
Or hell. Should it be heaven or hell? How is this heaven? Heaven.

331
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:41,880
Don't ask me. Okay. I think it's just supposed to be bright.

332
01:29:42,680 --> 01:30:12,520
Yeah. He's just going to walk around aimlessly and then you disappear

333
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:24,569
because you're not going to be in this. Yeah. He's just like, wait, what?

334
01:30:25,529 --> 01:30:44,340
What? How did I get here? No, the old man in the crown also died is what you meant to say.

335
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:51,060
Do the dumpster scene again with the old man in the crown. But he ends up in hell.

336
01:30:51,060 --> 01:31:03,640
No, but he already died. No, no, no, no. I can't do this. I can't do it twice.

337
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:07,399
I do that every time. Somebody told me, they came in and they said you do the,

338
01:31:07,399 --> 01:31:10,680
you do it every time. You make the thing happen twice.

339
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:20,939
All right. If I can have him do it in hell, I will. Okay. If I can jump into dumpster in hell

340
01:31:21,739 --> 01:31:37,829
and then he wakes up somewhere else, I will. Okay. Hell. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

341
01:31:37,829 --> 01:31:58,250
We got to go. We got to go back inside of the pizza place. Okay.

342
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:06,390
Okay.

343
01:32:20,039 --> 01:33:28,039
He's lifting his arm. No, no, no, no, no. Carry him to the dumpster. No, no, no.

344
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:51,130
He's just going to wake up in hell now. No, no. What are you doing? I want you. Got you.

345
01:33:51,130 --> 01:34:32,810
Throw into dumpster. The ant is my favorite one. Like ever. Where is it?

346
01:34:32,810 --> 01:35:10,779
Alleyway. Alleyway. Am I stupid? Oh, it's got to be, I got to have a close-up of her throwing

347
01:35:11,420 --> 01:36:08,470
and then it cut to this. Oh my. So it's going to go from here. Like from here.

348
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:24,420
No, no, no, no. What's going on? Whatever. I didn't, I didn't mark it. Oops. I didn't think

349
01:36:24,420 --> 01:37:11,819
I had to. That's so fucking horrible. So now a scene before this, I need to have like a

350
01:37:11,819 --> 01:37:21,130
close-up of putting the body down or throwing or throwing something. So let's just go,

351
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:30,739
I wonder if there's a good, yeah, throw will look all right if I get close enough.

352
01:37:30,739 --> 01:37:38,310
Throw away or thrown out will be okay because there's a very clear shove. There we go. Yeah,

353
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:57,109
this is perfect. Now who was it? Was it you? Was it somebody? I think it's you.

354
01:37:57,670 --> 01:38:22,060
Let's get rid of you as an actor. You're not going to be in this frame.

355
01:38:22,699 --> 01:38:56,869
We also need to respect the line here. We should get rid of the door.

356
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:22,170
You know what? It actually works if that was the Kim. Oh, this is perfect. Yeah, this works.

357
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:25,930
I was afraid that I, because I didn't know if it looked like it was going to be falling or not.

358
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:47,670
This is going to be horrible. I hope you guys understand. Why did the hair change?

359
01:39:55,670 --> 01:40:14,300
It's a wrong actor. I thought it wasn't Lola. Who was it? Marine? I mean, no. Who was it

360
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:22,760
before? Let's see. We can see who it is. No, it is this. It's this girl. I think their

361
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:33,579
clothes change and their hair change every time. No, this is, it's fine. All right. Mark it.

362
01:40:39,300 --> 01:41:04,760
And then she falls in too because she walked off. Then we got to be in hell.

363
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:31,029
Heaven. Hell. Oh, I get it. It's just, all right. Should scream spin and then pull the whole

364
01:41:31,029 --> 01:41:57,590
thing up and he's in hell. Hold on. I do have like a demon. Group chase all the demons.

365
01:41:57,590 --> 01:42:57,000
Yeah, absolutely. I need the, where are they? Just need some monsters. An angel in hell.

366
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:27,050
That's so stupid. Yeah. I'm going to put like a devil on the, on the horse.

367
01:43:38,949 --> 01:43:52,760
Scream spin or riot. Scream spin. Scream spin. Scream spin. Are you sure about that? Are you,

368
01:43:52,760 --> 01:44:01,000
you're sure you, you, I a hundred percent. You sure about this? Like, are you sure?

369
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:48,569
After seeing that. Just keep the cheerleader. Do, do all red ants. I can put red ants like

370
01:44:48,569 --> 01:45:26,810
around the corners. Wait, hold on. Here. There'll be a red ant on the horse. No,

371
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:50,760
nevermind. Sorry. I can't do that. I have to change this. Here we go. I will add a scream

372
01:45:50,760 --> 01:46:08,939
spin before this and this would be, this will play us out. I got this. I got this. I got this.

373
01:46:08,939 --> 01:46:45,579
Scream spin. By the way, backwards shot eyes and then the run. Now he's going to put

374
01:46:45,579 --> 01:47:10,380
this piece of shit together. All right. I'm going to change something here though.

375
01:47:10,939 --> 01:47:27,829
I need to add an angel here just so, just so it's very clear.

376
01:47:28,390 --> 01:48:04,810
Because is that, is that soul? That could be its soul. There's a lot of meaning here.

377
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:24,970
Ready? Print it. Stamp it. Now let's get to real work. Let's go. Save the game.

378
01:48:27,609 --> 01:48:49,689
Pea pants mod. Yes. Shoot it. All right. Uh, begin casting. We're good. We got everything

379
01:48:49,689 --> 01:49:01,100
we need. I need the sets. I need the sets. I need Howard as the director. Okay.

380
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:32,550
I need sets. I need the pizzeria. I need hell. Pizzeria. Okay. Anything else?

381
01:49:35,109 --> 01:49:46,039
Think I'm good. Ready to shoot. Shoot it. I know you're upset. You'll be fine.

382
01:49:48,199 --> 01:49:53,159
Wait, wait. Tropical beach. Tropical beach. I need the wild west saloon. Hold on.

383
01:49:53,800 --> 01:50:01,050
What the fuck is tropical beach for? I need heaven.

384
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:18,810
I gotta start deleting some stuff. Yeah. Let's delete this. Actually hold on. I need more space.

385
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:22,300
I need heaven.

386
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:45,289
I'm out of room. All right. I got to delete this. This shit's gotta go. How do I raise

387
01:50:45,289 --> 01:50:53,829
a building? I know there's a way you can do it. I think I have to get a builder.

388
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:59,220
Yeah. I need a builder. I don't think I didn't have any.

389
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:16,779
I don't have one builder. All right. You come here. No. I have to go like this.

390
01:51:18,619 --> 01:51:23,300
Delete. Thank you. Well, I didn't need that.

391
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:44,310
I got the pizzeria. Western saloon, right? Tropical beach and wild west saloon.

392
01:51:51,560 --> 01:52:05,859
Wild west saloon. This is enormous. Can I just delete the scene that this is attached to?

393
01:52:06,579 --> 01:53:05,000
I have to get rid of more buildings. Okay. That's it. That's it. Done. All right.

394
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:20,229
Save it. Pea pants mod. Here we go. It's ready to shoot. Let's hope the whole game doesn't break.

395
01:53:24,699 --> 01:53:44,149
No, not PR. Shoot it. Three, two, one, go. We're being ruined.

396
01:53:51,539 --> 01:53:55,619
No, this is the scenes. The scene placement doesn't matter because we can change it in editing.

397
01:53:57,510 --> 01:54:01,989
No, if you weren't here in the last few streams, you don't. That doesn't matter.

398
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:20,729
All right. Here we go. Post production. This is where the fun begins. Fix it in post. That's

399
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:41,159
true. That is what we plan to do. It's so funny how this progressed to, oh, this is a funny idea.

400
01:54:41,159 --> 01:54:47,539
Oh, yeah. Look, it's the burger thing. Look at this. How it fucked up. I'm terrified now.

401
01:54:48,180 --> 01:55:00,260
I'm scared. I don't want to get in trouble. I got to change this. It progressed. But that's

402
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:03,300
what happens in the editing room. You figure out what you can and can't do and then you do

403
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:15,420
it. So first things first, the most important thing I would say is we need to move. We need

404
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:19,340
to do some rearranging and we're going to cut everything. What's the music, first of all?

405
01:55:20,619 --> 01:55:53,510
It's actually kind of perfect. Okay, so this is way too long. Maybe I should start with

406
01:55:53,510 --> 01:56:04,250
them just holding it. How long? This is like 40 seconds. This doesn't need to be this much.

407
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:36,310
I think it's right here. All right. No, no, no. We're going to do some inner cutting here

408
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:39,909
because this inner cutting is because this is like weird fucked up plans. I was like running

409
01:56:39,909 --> 01:57:02,180
the restaurant in the ground. So like right here, we'll cut like, let's see, right here.

410
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:18,100
We're saved. So let's go like this. All right. Let's take a look how this looks.

411
01:57:29,739 --> 01:58:21,979
Sooner. Sounds like sonic music. Bang. Money. Cut back. There it is. Paying the

412
01:58:21,979 --> 01:58:34,579
ant right when it comes up in the air. I think right like here. I'd say right here.

413
01:58:34,579 --> 01:58:44,579
Let's take a look. You're like right before it comes up. I think right here is safe

414
01:58:44,579 --> 01:59:39,859
and that goes over here. Actually, I think it should be shorter. There it is. That's good.

415
01:59:39,859 --> 01:59:57,460
Right there. The rest is now he gets in something. There's no getting people's faces too. I'm not

416
01:59:57,460 --> 02:00:11,699
sure we even need that. I don't think we need him getting in somebody's face. Maybe a couple

417
02:00:11,699 --> 02:00:22,840
more of those beats like right in everybody's face. Where's another one of those like

418
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:46,600
big hits? All right. Let's use the we got this one. It's right like here. Right. Bang. Right

419
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:58,489
there. Get rid of this portion. Just add it to the extended edition. Let's see what it

420
02:00:58,489 --> 02:01:26,890
looks like if I just put it over here now. I don't understand. What is that? Oh no. It's

421
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:34,069
the song. It's the song. It's the song. You can't edit to. I forgot. You can't edit

422
02:01:34,949 --> 02:01:44,250
to sounds and songs. I forgot because it changes everything. Yeah. I keep forgetting. I

423
02:01:44,250 --> 02:02:06,949
can't treat this like final cut or premiere. This the song. It still works. No. It's still

424
02:02:06,949 --> 02:02:16,090
fine. No. I don't like how that is. I think I want the close up one. Yeah. I want the

425
02:02:16,090 --> 02:02:44,810
close up. Where's the close up when he gets right in his face? Right here. What is this

426
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:54,390
movie? This is a food store, a food, a restaurant that is in like trouble and

427
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:58,659
shit. And there's nothing to do with any restaurant you've already known about.

428
02:03:01,659 --> 02:03:15,479
Well, I don't know. Where is it? Right here. There we go. All right. Let's see.

429
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:49,819
Oh yeah. These guys have to come in. I do want to have this one pop in somewhere too.

430
02:03:49,819 --> 02:04:33,239
He's just constantly berating his employees. Let's cut it right there. Back to back.

431
02:04:50,899 --> 02:04:54,539
I'm like doing it to the music and I shouldn't be. I don't know why this is

432
02:04:54,539 --> 02:05:02,779
a music video. I don't know what I'm. I don't know why I'm doing that. It's just

433
02:05:02,779 --> 02:05:39,859
becoming a music video. I don't know why I'm. I don't know why it just is. That's

434
02:05:39,859 --> 02:06:03,659
where it's going. Okay. Now they come in. This has to be like right here. Looks good.

435
02:06:03,659 --> 02:06:57,399
They walk in. It's not perfect. It's not perfect, but like it's hard to edit with this

436
02:06:57,399 --> 02:07:03,800
timeline, but I think it's pretty good. I like this like West side story type intro.

437
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:22,039
By the way, he's serving him poison. Everybody catching that?

438
02:07:47,619 --> 02:08:05,979
Everyone's like sits down and starts like eating and choking. Let's get rid of this.

439
02:08:05,979 --> 02:08:36,949
Let's see. How does it be together so far? You can already start to hear people coughing.

440
02:08:51,399 --> 02:09:02,939
Boom. Like food. I think this is wasted space here. I'm going to save it just in case. Well,

441
02:09:02,939 --> 02:09:08,100
I'm going to actually save it. I don't think we need all this.

442
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:24,119
We definitely need this though. I need this over here.

443
02:09:27,699 --> 02:10:16,100
Let's keep this clip for when we need it. I'm going to put so much like somebody fucking

444
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:25,880
sneezes and shit back here. Wait, she goes back to eating after that.

445
02:10:50,520 --> 02:11:31,750
It matches perfectly. All right. Need another one. And cut to them ordering right here.

446
02:11:31,750 --> 02:12:01,140
I will take this please. This is not even a central character. Why do we care?

447
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:38,890
What is going on on the left side of the screen? There we go. Right here. Right when it

448
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:53,449
goes in, like in the mouth, like right here. What the hell does he do back here?

449
02:12:53,449 --> 02:12:59,939
Oh, he's just cleaning the bar. It goes here.

450
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:18,630
All right. I think that's, I don't think we need any more of that. Let's watch it from here.

451
02:13:51,029 --> 02:14:32,300
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait. I'm just tending bar. Is he in his pants? Is he daydreaming?

452
02:14:32,300 --> 02:14:45,029
He's daydreaming. All right. Let's see how this looks over here. It was right here.

453
02:14:57,670 --> 02:15:00,710
Sometimes the music feels like it doesn't line up the way it did previously.

454
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:04,869
You know what I'm saying? Because I have to cut more off the snow.

455
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:09,739
It's not going to be perfect, but it'll still be funny. Right? It'll still be fun.

456
02:15:56,550 --> 02:16:07,979
And he's like, oh my God. He's self-serving. Okay. This is where he doesn't notice people

457
02:16:07,979 --> 02:16:36,790
are coughing. And this is when they leave. That looks good. Because what's going to happen

458
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:49,739
here is it's going to be like bang. Like what the fuck is that? New music? Well,

459
02:16:49,739 --> 02:16:56,889
this is not going to be a music video anymore as of like once the song is over. And we're almost

460
02:16:56,889 --> 02:17:10,459
at, this is almost dead. Okay. Somebody gets like, okay, what's going on here?

461
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:15,500
Something else happens. Yeah. They go, they leave. Like, I don't like this place.

462
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:24,780
Oh, then there's like a fucking huge fight here. Everyone leaves. Why is he sleeping?

463
02:17:26,809 --> 02:17:29,770
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I should probably put this.

464
02:17:30,569 --> 02:18:04,760
Hold on. He can't be doing both things. He can't be doing both at the same time.

465
02:18:19,829 --> 02:18:28,260
It's a dream? No, but he, okay, he's tending bar, but he wasn't actually, he's asleep here.

466
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:38,520
So these two things didn't happen. This is happening. So then why would he be daydreaming

467
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:48,120
about himself sleeping, dreaming about himself on the beach, which is a daydream of him tending bar?

468
02:18:48,120 --> 02:19:19,319
Why would he be doing this? That doesn't make any sense. Why would he be daydreaming that?

469
02:19:19,319 --> 02:19:46,649
Hold on. What do you do? Okay. That's about it. That's going to be quicker.

470
02:19:49,879 --> 02:20:18,629
Right here. All right. I think that's better. Okay. So here's the cough.

471
02:20:19,510 --> 02:20:37,770
Make sure I got it in the right spot. Yeah, I do. Somebody has to choke this.

472
02:20:37,770 --> 02:20:43,450
Yeah, this one right here. So we don't need this guy anymore.

473
02:20:43,450 --> 02:20:47,590
We got a great shot of him already. Just put a transition in for the dream.

474
02:20:48,659 --> 02:20:55,290
Yeah, but which one is the dream? Yeah, we don't need that anymore.

475
02:20:55,930 --> 02:21:19,579
So that brings us to here. So this is a daydream of, this is so fucking odd.

476
02:21:19,579 --> 02:21:51,819
Okay. So fade out, fade in. So this is the daydream, but this is him sleeping.

477
02:21:51,819 --> 02:22:01,180
But this is also a daydream at the end here. You understand?

478
02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:39,739
Save it. Save it. Save it. I will. Let's flip these. No. All right. I like it.

479
02:22:39,739 --> 02:22:44,020
This is like too much. I liked this better when it was just him sitting there

480
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:54,819
daydreaming about himself serving himself a drink. This gets too meta.

481
02:22:58,649 --> 02:23:06,809
Yeah, it's out. It's out. But I'm not going to delete it though,

482
02:23:06,809 --> 02:23:18,950
because what if I want it somewhere? Okay. So let's see what I got.

483
02:23:18,950 --> 02:23:53,260
I'm taking off the fades too. So it needs to come in a little quicker here.

484
02:23:53,260 --> 02:24:34,420
Okay. It's fine, but the king sleeping cannot be here. This is the argument.

485
02:24:34,420 --> 02:25:00,299
So let's put this over here. Keep it. Keep it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

486
02:25:00,299 --> 02:25:06,700
Cough, cough, getting out, sleeping and getting out. Let's just see how it looks.

487
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:16,569
I want to give it a try and get these transitions off though. Okay.

488
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:39,299
Why? He goes. Oh, this part sucks.

489
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:49,190
All right. What else happens? There's the big fight and then the...

490
02:25:51,979 --> 02:25:55,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. No, excuse me.

491
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:58,059
He's going to smoke just in the restaurant and more people are going to leave.

492
02:26:08,540 --> 02:26:54,280
And then he gets confronted. Are the people still in the restaurant?

493
02:27:01,620 --> 02:27:04,420
Oh yeah. The person that really likes the food. I forgot. Yeah. She likes...

494
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:08,700
Wolfs it down. All right. Yeah. That has to be intercut somewhere in between the fight.

495
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:14,260
No, we already have him drinking poison and dying. We don't need like another

496
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:20,059
death scene for the king. Yeah, I can get rid of this. This is a, this is a,

497
02:27:20,059 --> 02:27:27,000
I got what I wanted from it. I don't need it. I have poison death.

498
02:27:31,659 --> 02:27:40,170
Okay. So this is where we need to start to figure out how, let me just see how this looks.

499
02:27:50,600 --> 02:28:02,069
Oh my God. That's, that looks just awful. It's just awful, but I don't think I want to change

500
02:28:02,069 --> 02:28:11,219
it. All right. What else? Oh yeah. What else can I put here? Wait, they come back in?

501
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:22,309
Who comes in? Why do people come back in? Is it too cold outside? Are these the same people

502
02:28:22,309 --> 02:28:52,069
that left? No. Are these the cops? I forgot about this shit. Okay. Then. All right. All

503
02:28:52,069 --> 02:28:56,979
right. All right. All right. So let's do this one by one here. Argument. People come. Then

504
02:28:56,979 --> 02:29:15,850
okay. That gives me a transitional piece. Here they come. And then we get the shove

505
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:31,159
right here. So I don't need this portion here. I got this and then they're going to fight.

506
02:29:31,159 --> 02:29:58,950
Let's get rid of that. In come the people enter cold. That is not long enough at all.

507
02:30:00,069 --> 02:30:18,200
We're almost at the end of the song. What the hell do I do now that the song is over?

508
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:39,370
All right. Now, right when the first punch is thrown, that's when we get the like action

509
02:30:39,370 --> 02:30:55,450
song. So like, this is fine. Let's go like. You want it? Let's see if it fits.

510
02:31:03,670 --> 02:31:05,190
No, it's got to come in when they're arguing.

511
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:46,260
Someone kicked to the jukebox. I don't think it fits. We need something quicker.

512
02:31:46,819 --> 02:31:56,729
We need something that comes in quicker. Sorry, guys. I tried.

513
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:32,969
That's too quick. It would have to be something like this.

514
02:32:32,969 --> 02:33:23,909
It escalates in a thousand percent. We need her eating, like eating the food like really,

515
02:33:23,909 --> 02:33:34,280
really fast. This will match with this song too. I think her like, let's see.

516
02:33:43,479 --> 02:34:21,620
Yeah, like cut it right here. So like you think that she throws up right into the camera.

517
02:35:12,729 --> 02:35:14,709
This is this is a run.

518
02:35:14,709 --> 02:36:07,590
I think it's just, oh, I hold on. Let me see how this looks.

519
02:36:24,219 --> 02:36:30,739
Cyanide, zero with 10 community subs. Thank you. Thank you so much for the 10

520
02:36:30,739 --> 02:36:40,579
fucking subs. A lot of community subs tonight. Today, should I say? All right,

521
02:36:40,579 --> 02:36:47,319
get me in here. What does it need to be? I'm thinking like the wicked dumb run

522
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:51,639
and then instantly throw them out the window and then the eating and then like the puking.

523
02:37:00,739 --> 02:37:24,379
I don't need this anymore then. Is that is it? How is that stupid?

524
02:37:43,719 --> 02:37:46,600
Kick before out the window. That's true.

525
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:57,079
Yeah, it could do. Oh, I hold on.

526
02:37:57,559 --> 02:38:04,620
I need to cut this in half. Bang, right here. That should be enough to make him go out the

527
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:19,659
window. How does he get in front of him like this? Actually, it kind of works because he's

528
02:38:19,659 --> 02:38:40,340
behind him. What window is he going out of? This one? He's going out of one of these side

529
02:38:41,139 --> 02:39:20,680
windows. Let's see. Let's move some stuff around. See if it looks better like this.

530
02:39:32,309 --> 02:39:40,090
Oh, that's great.

531
02:39:53,860 --> 02:40:13,799
Okay, now we have, how the hell am I going to do this? Yeah, new, I got to get new music

532
02:40:14,680 --> 02:40:18,040
let's play this. Let me see how this plays out from like here.

533
02:41:33,129 --> 02:41:53,590
Oh my god. All right, we are about, I'd say 40% of the way there. The best is yet to come,

534
02:41:53,590 --> 02:41:59,000
if you could believe that. Delete the sleeping and messes with the sink.

535
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:09,340
Uh, here's the unfortunate thing. And I figured out how this game works. So when you play from

536
02:42:09,340 --> 02:42:15,690
any part of the timeline, it has to load the music separately. All the sounds are loaded

537
02:42:15,690 --> 02:42:23,850
separately. So sometimes it just puts itself out of sync. Unfortunately, no matter if you move

538
02:42:23,850 --> 02:42:37,799
anything around, it's like rendering two things at the same time. It's weird. Because if I

539
02:42:37,799 --> 02:42:48,200
delete this, the whole thing will squish down and the music too. It's really hard to actually

540
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:54,979
get anything in sync in the movies, especially if you have a lot of sounds. Yeah, I got it. I

541
02:42:54,979 --> 02:43:01,479
saved it. I got it. I'm good. All right, let me, let me take this opportunity. It's been

542
02:43:01,479 --> 02:43:07,079
about three hours. Let me go, I'm going to go pee. So I got it saved. We're about 40%

543
02:43:07,079 --> 02:43:11,829
of the way. Maybe a little bit more. I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back and

544
02:43:11,829 --> 02:46:17,299
we'll continue this, uh, absolute atrocity of cinema. See you in a minute. Hey, I'm back.

545
02:46:17,299 --> 02:46:19,899
All right. So we've got

546
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:51,979
the music can now change to like, here comes a situation where a guy's coming in to sneak and

547
02:46:51,979 --> 02:47:01,700
take pictures of the restaurant, right? Because that's what comes up next. But then

548
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:06,569
he immediately just falls down and then they hold him down and beat him up. And he's supposed to be

549
02:47:07,370 --> 02:47:15,700
he's dead here, right? Oh, and then the, then they come in with the, the police come in

550
02:47:16,700 --> 02:47:24,229
and he's sitting in a rocket. How am I going to do with this? Why does the ant go to heaven

551
02:47:24,229 --> 02:47:42,120
again? Well, you'll see. You'll see very shortly. All right. So let's back it up.

552
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:47,370
Let's get this out of here because I don't think I need that. Wait, maybe just one quick.

553
02:47:48,329 --> 02:48:23,700
Let's go like this. The guy with the Ghostbusters

554
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:43,959
ecto gun thing. All right. Let's go with, hmm, how about eerie house? See how that looks.

555
02:49:16,819 --> 02:49:27,000
Well, we don't need all this. We just need this. Like what the fuck are you doing here?

556
02:49:34,280 --> 02:50:02,299
Mom, I got to call you back. Uh, something just went down in the pizzeria.

557
02:50:03,899 --> 02:50:18,100
In fact, can you like come fucking pick me up? All right. Let's, so first of all, he comes in,

558
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:27,110
maybe he should, it should like, he steps on it here. You know what I'm saying?

559
02:50:27,670 --> 02:50:55,459
At this moment, this is like too much lead in room. I mean, do, do I just not give a shit

560
02:50:55,459 --> 02:51:11,670
and have this happen like this? What if he just walks in and they grab him? Let me see what happens

561
02:51:11,670 --> 02:51:30,620
if he just walks in with his health inspector radar gun and then they just grab him. This guy

562
02:51:30,620 --> 02:52:15,899
didn't even do anything. He's the health inspector. Just having new music. This is

563
02:52:15,899 --> 02:52:21,620
like, this is like not, not nice movie. This is like, this is bad. This is just mean and

564
02:52:22,020 --> 02:53:16,760
Oh my God. Settle down. Oh, okay. This is back here. I need another song though. We need something.

565
02:53:18,819 --> 02:53:32,139
Hmm. Fantasy battle. Femme fatale. Give me 24 hours. Haunted house. What's this one called

566
02:53:32,219 --> 02:53:49,299
again? A lone fight. Haunted house. Let's give this one a try. Oh, not that far. Too far.

567
02:53:49,299 --> 02:54:06,709
Like right here. Actually it's in the right spot. This, I already had this one on here.

568
02:54:07,430 --> 02:54:10,469
No, this is not, this is eerie house, not haunted house.

569
02:54:10,790 --> 02:55:25,690
Hold on. No, that doesn't, it keep going. That's, I kind of like, oh, stupid. That isn't a problem.

570
02:55:43,700 --> 02:56:12,340
All right. I don't think we need the banana peel. Yeah. These two scenes can go,

571
02:56:13,139 --> 02:56:20,629
but after that is the kind of the panic, right? Yeah. We just killed the guy.

572
02:56:20,629 --> 02:57:03,719
Panic, right? It goes here. Nope. No, no, no. Wrong spot. Wrong spot. Here. Hold on,

573
02:57:03,719 --> 02:57:05,959
hold on. I can, I'm going to, I'm just going to move these around.

574
02:57:23,299 --> 02:57:52,940
Wait a second. Did they, the clothes switched? Oh well. Okay. We need, it needs to be on that

575
02:57:52,940 --> 02:58:27,270
same beat. Come on, you little twig. See if that adds a little bit to it.

576
02:58:27,270 --> 02:58:50,379
It's not long enough. Actually it might fit if I do this. This, just delete these. I'm not going

577
02:58:50,379 --> 02:59:00,659
to use the banana peel. There's no reason to use it. It's just kind of wasted space here. Although

578
02:59:00,659 --> 02:59:03,459
hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

579
02:59:03,459 --> 02:59:22,899
Wait just a second here. I like that reaction from the ant. I like that. That's motivation

580
02:59:22,899 --> 02:59:56,120
there. I like it. Kill him. Bang. Right here. The ant is like, oh fuck, this is not good.

581
02:59:56,200 --> 03:00:07,979
Right, right here. Although he switches sides, unfortunately. Let's see if it looks, let's see

582
03:00:07,979 --> 03:00:51,479
how it looks. Hold on, let's see. No, no, no. Wait, wait, what? I shouldn't have done that.

583
03:00:56,309 --> 03:01:16,069
I could put it, hold on, let me see. Yeah, maybe before, before the attack. That's not a bad

584
03:01:16,069 --> 03:01:20,870
idea because he doesn't want to do it and he tried. Hold on, let's see. Let's just take

585
03:01:20,870 --> 03:01:55,819
a look and see how it looks. It's perfect. He wants nothing to do with it. He has a conscience.

586
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:04,459
I like it both ways. I like it. He has it. He's like, I don't want to do that.

587
03:02:04,459 --> 03:02:08,780
He's like, oh no, someone's here, but ready? Check this out. Like here comes a health inspector

588
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:14,760
and then you've got, he knows what's going to happen. Like, oh no. And he's, now I have to

589
03:02:14,760 --> 03:02:23,270
go do this. The other way is we did it and then, oh no, we did that. We should not have

590
03:02:23,270 --> 03:02:56,469
done that. Hmm. Hmm. It's tricky. Yeah, it's, it's, I like it this way. You can even see

591
03:02:57,350 --> 03:03:10,549
shaking his head left and right. No. Oh, fuck. What if we don't, what if we don't know?

592
03:03:15,639 --> 03:03:28,100
This is a little too long. Wait, wait, wait. Back, back, back, back, back.

593
03:03:33,510 --> 03:03:38,229
Right there. It looks all right. No, but we get the, no, I like, I like the king

594
03:03:38,229 --> 03:04:05,059
like doing like the, you're dead. We'll just come in here. It's like a tiny little piece

595
03:04:05,059 --> 03:04:16,040
that's just sticking out here. Who the hell is it? The best part is how he says,

596
03:04:17,370 --> 03:04:24,219
you're dead. And he like thinks it's great. And then instantly with his hand still going down,

597
03:04:24,219 --> 03:04:32,520
goes, oh, whoops. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're dead. Hand still in the air. He

598
03:04:32,520 --> 03:05:05,959
immediately comes down into, oh fuck. What have I done? It's gotta be right. It's gotta be

599
03:05:05,959 --> 03:05:19,180
right here. Let's just see, make sure it's correct. Yeah. Killer beast. Yeah. Oh.

600
03:05:26,600 --> 03:05:42,569
Perfect. What people say in voice acting. I don't think I want to voice act this one.

601
03:05:43,370 --> 03:05:49,239
I think it's perfectly fine as a silent film. I think it speaks. The whole thing speaks

602
03:05:49,239 --> 03:06:33,829
already. All right. We're, we're almost done. Pretty perfect. All right. Moving on. Save it.

603
03:06:33,829 --> 03:06:47,479
You got it. Got to go in and get rid of this one. Where is it? Come here. There's another

604
03:06:47,479 --> 03:06:55,209
little, just tiny little piece somewhere. Where is it? Oh no, it's just this. This

605
03:06:55,209 --> 03:07:01,180
can get out of here. We don't need this anymore. He said now he's just waiting. Yeah,

606
03:07:01,180 --> 03:07:31,510
he's waiting. Okay. We're going to do some intercutting here. He stands up. Ant is like

607
03:07:31,510 --> 03:07:53,430
going out the back. I don't need this anymore. We got the ant sneaking out the back. Okay. I can

608
03:07:53,430 --> 03:08:06,549
pull this back out. Um, we'll go two. Sounds good. There you go. So I need to bring this

609
03:08:07,940 --> 03:08:13,989
here. Yeah. The ant's like on his way out. What are you doing? What the hell was that?

610
03:08:18,629 --> 03:09:15,459
I gotta get out of here. Which way? Which way? Okay. Hold on. Hold on. This is the big,

611
03:09:15,459 --> 03:09:18,260
this is the shot here. This is the shot that matters.

612
03:10:05,430 --> 03:10:32,780
Why would you try to escape like this? He does it with his trash.

613
03:10:38,100 --> 03:10:54,469
He does it with his like fall. That's so funny. He even looks back. Why would you

614
03:10:54,469 --> 03:11:04,409
think it was full of stuff to break your fall? Doesn't make any sense.

615
03:11:05,540 --> 03:11:15,079
Okay. Um, he already is dead. All right. Hold on. This is now, you gotta move this over here.

616
03:11:18,940 --> 03:11:28,889
Oh, my fucking stomach. Okay. And then this is where the throw happens. So I gotta get this

617
03:11:28,889 --> 03:11:45,860
right. So like right here. Let's go put this over there. Oh, this is gonna be, I'm gonna

618
03:11:45,860 --> 03:12:09,860
fucking, is it gonna hurt? I already know it's gonna hurt. I already know. Okay. Hold on.

619
03:12:09,860 --> 03:13:35,209
I gotta get in close for this. I think I need that. I'm gonna cut it. I'm just gonna see what

620
03:13:35,209 --> 03:13:37,930
it looks like. I'm not gonna remove it, but I just need to move it to here.

621
03:14:06,870 --> 03:14:30,120
It's so, it needs to be like right there. Okay. There it is. I think I got it. That's so

622
03:14:30,120 --> 03:14:54,569
horrible. It's so fucking horrible. Wait, hold on. Let me pull this one back. Get over

623
03:14:54,569 --> 03:15:16,889
here. Get over there. It's so small. I can't grab it. I just, I want that little piece

624
03:15:16,889 --> 03:15:29,030
right there. Shit. Is it, I think it might be too small. It's alright. It's, it's perfect

625
03:15:29,030 --> 03:15:49,209
the way it is, but I'm just trying to make it over perfect. Just move everything to the right.

626
03:15:49,209 --> 03:16:04,520
Hold on. Let me see. I could just do that and then I need it to be here. This can,

627
03:16:04,520 --> 03:16:08,709
are these too small to move? These might be too small to move too. I guess they are.

628
03:16:11,110 --> 03:16:19,620
Too small to move. Now we gotta keep, we gotta keep it the way it was. Wait, hold on.

629
03:16:20,579 --> 03:16:41,879
It's better the other way. Look at that, right? God, that's fucking so horrible.

630
03:16:42,920 --> 03:16:46,299
That's just horrible. It's just, this is like you throwing something over about and into a

631
03:16:46,299 --> 03:16:58,149
dumpster. Okay, then I can just delete these. Can I even delete these or is this just gonna

632
03:16:58,149 --> 03:17:10,309
be at the end of the movie forever? No, I can delete them. Make sure this is actually

633
03:17:10,309 --> 03:17:34,729
gonna delete this. Right? That's, I'm on that scene, right? Okay, good. Alright, we're good.

634
03:17:34,729 --> 03:17:38,729
I love this one so much though. The original is always going to be my favorite because it's the

635
03:17:38,729 --> 03:17:54,940
ant and he's trying to escape. He's so dumb. He just doesn't understand. Alright, now we need

636
03:17:54,940 --> 03:18:04,870
hell. Let's zoom back out. Let's go with two pumps in there. Alright, hell. This is where

637
03:18:04,870 --> 03:18:24,219
he wakes up. He wakes up in hell and then he gets chased by the monsters. Let's see how this

638
03:18:24,219 --> 03:18:44,620
looks. That scene can be deleted. Yeah, I'm gonna use different music. I'm just trying

639
03:18:44,620 --> 03:19:14,790
to get it in the right spot. It's done. Now we just have to make it, we just have to fine-tune it.

640
03:19:30,219 --> 03:20:05,319
Alright, perfect. Post-credits scene. I can't do post-credits on foot. Yes, I can. Oh, why not?

641
03:20:05,319 --> 03:20:26,440
No, he's dead. He's, he's very dead. It's, he's dead. No, no, no, no, he's dead. He's dead.

642
03:20:26,440 --> 03:20:44,489
That cheapens, that cheapens the fall if he's alive. He's dead. That cheapens the fall.

643
03:20:44,489 --> 03:20:52,620
Look, he can do, we can do an ant in heaven movie. Alright, it's done. Now we have to

644
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:58,260
change music, add some sound effects, and print the damn thing. This is almost, this is three

645
03:20:58,260 --> 03:21:11,399
and a half minutes long. You just dropped it a whole letter grade. Alright, so let's go back to

646
03:21:11,399 --> 03:21:44,170
here. This is fine. This is, right? This is like the music video, right? We get, we gotta

647
03:21:44,170 --> 03:21:54,180
add some like, some song in here. No, song. Uh, some sound effects. I'm thinking just,

648
03:21:54,180 --> 03:22:04,020
just like yells and shit and like anger. There's gonna be tons of coughing. Yeah,

649
03:22:04,020 --> 03:22:18,340
this is gonna get, I'm not gonna overdo it. Breathe heavy. Let's put that over here.

650
03:22:19,059 --> 03:22:22,020
Yeah, he gets right in his face and like breathes in his face.

651
03:22:30,379 --> 03:22:55,000
Another breathe heavy? Or maybe like a, is it like an anger? Yawn? Slurps? No, no slurps.

652
03:22:55,719 --> 03:23:06,760
We're gonna add those later. Scream. How about just like, just like a little like,

653
03:23:09,659 --> 03:23:10,379
that's not really,

654
03:23:15,909 --> 03:23:25,770
I always put scream one. What, I didn't know what scream two is. I don't think I've ever

655
03:23:25,770 --> 03:23:51,639
touched it. Right. There's probably two because it has two chest bumps forward.

656
03:23:52,360 --> 03:24:15,350
Let's do scream two. Scream three. No, I'm not adding that. Let's just see what it does.

657
03:24:31,930 --> 03:24:36,409
All right, I gotta ask, does, does this ruin the music video portion?

658
03:24:39,770 --> 03:24:56,620
Yes, it does. It does. So I don't need anything here. Yeah, we don't need anything here.

659
03:24:57,260 --> 03:25:43,930
This is like good. Good. I'm gonna emphasize these though. Double cough.

660
03:25:52,620 --> 03:26:30,420
I don't like this one. I'm not sure it needs it here. I don't think it needs it. So let's add,

661
03:26:30,420 --> 03:27:57,510
let's add like a puke sound here. What was that? All right. Am I George Lucas-ing?

662
03:28:05,559 --> 03:28:11,799
The puke would sound perfect with the music. Just hold on. Like,

663
03:28:13,559 --> 03:28:36,790
hold on, I gotta get the right spot. This way. Come on. Damn it. Damn it.

664
03:28:36,870 --> 03:30:45,430
Got it. Why'd it change? I had it right. I had it. Okay, hold on. Okay. I'll meet you. I'm gonna

665
03:30:45,430 --> 03:30:52,809
meet you guys halfway here. I'm gonna meet you halfway. This shouldn't be here because

666
03:30:53,899 --> 03:30:59,500
it, this is a big deal. This is like the everyone starts to leave and it doesn't match

667
03:30:59,500 --> 03:31:05,000
up with the music. But this is like the, somebody pukes behind us and we're going to

668
03:31:05,079 --> 03:31:59,659
leave. Let's see. It kind of like ruins the, I like that because, yeah, let's delete this one.

669
03:31:59,659 --> 03:32:03,739
It ruins this whole music video. And it's like, well, hold on a minute. People are like,

670
03:32:03,739 --> 03:32:15,260
something's wrong with somebody back there. This is not good. I don't think I'll ever,

671
03:32:16,250 --> 03:32:20,329
I'm never going to grow up. This is never going to happen. I'm sorry. This is not going

672
03:32:20,329 --> 03:32:38,389
to happen. I really don't think so. Change, change the music here. Like, oh wait. Oh,

673
03:32:38,389 --> 03:32:44,229
okay. Hold on a minute. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is important

674
03:32:44,229 --> 03:33:02,180
because I need a song that can be, I can't, I don't think I can because I have the music

675
03:33:02,180 --> 03:33:19,879
all blocked out already. Imagine if you were sitting at a restaurant and you had just ordered.

676
03:33:19,879 --> 03:33:28,860
You gave your order to the giant aunt. That's red flag number one. And then you hear that.

677
03:33:28,860 --> 03:33:33,350
Apparently like whoever this is, they don't really mind. You look at this is just like,

678
03:33:33,350 --> 03:33:41,000
excuse me. What is going on back there? All right. Let's play. Keep going.

679
03:33:47,850 --> 03:34:13,180
We need like a big sniff here. You know what I mean? Like watch his eyes. It matches with

680
03:34:13,180 --> 03:34:33,180
his eyes blinking. No, he doesn't. I don't think there's another one.

681
03:34:55,659 --> 03:34:59,129
Okay. There's like, there's some changes that need to be made here

682
03:34:59,850 --> 03:35:03,209
because this, this music just kind of, this music needs to come in sooner.

683
03:35:07,610 --> 03:35:12,579
No, no, no, it doesn't. It can't. It matches up too perfectly here with her eating.

684
03:35:16,469 --> 03:35:21,450
Is there like a sound I can make? Once I start fucking with George Lucas audio here

685
03:35:22,170 --> 03:35:25,690
is when I've made a bunch of mistakes in the last one. I don't want to do that now.

686
03:35:26,250 --> 03:35:33,459
Let me think. Hold on. What about just like horror sounds?

687
03:35:34,860 --> 03:35:56,760
Is there like scary sounds you put in silence? Unfortunately, no. That is the one

688
03:35:58,459 --> 03:36:04,379
large downfall to the movies is they were smart enough to put a timeline editor in here.

689
03:36:04,379 --> 03:36:10,700
And it's really, really, really fun to use, but you can't individually edit audio files.

690
03:36:11,659 --> 03:36:17,500
This is just for the whole track. You can't make it per audio clip. You have, there's

691
03:36:17,500 --> 03:36:23,770
no muting. It's just, if you put a song in here, it does the whole thing.

692
03:36:23,770 --> 03:36:29,959
And all importing silence would do is just layer on top because it just keeps whatever

693
03:36:29,959 --> 03:36:46,149
is underneath it too. Unfortunately, add bone crunches, edit the song in audacity and then

694
03:36:46,149 --> 03:36:57,420
import it. I mean, you know what? That could work, but I would need to do it to every

695
03:36:57,420 --> 03:37:02,219
single song. And that would take, I mean, that would take a significant portion of time

696
03:37:02,219 --> 03:37:10,020
for me. I mean, we're currently live right now. That's a lot of work for what is effectively

697
03:37:11,959 --> 03:37:24,100
an ant falling into a dumpster. Just add a new song that's silence.

698
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:30,870
Well, it'll just layer on top. Put in a record scratch.

699
03:37:32,790 --> 03:37:43,690
All right, let's see. Dirt falling, metal, pour, splash, phone ring, toilet flush?

700
03:37:46,059 --> 03:37:55,579
Maybe this should be a toilet flush somewhere. Fire extinguisher. I don't know if there's a

701
03:37:55,579 --> 03:38:16,059
phone ringing. He's George Lucas-ing. He's George Lucas-ing. Let's see. Human sounds.

702
03:38:24,659 --> 03:38:27,940
I can click them. Yeah. Somebody told me I could double click them and it would play.

703
03:38:27,940 --> 03:38:35,770
That person is a fucking saint. All right. Violent sounds.

704
03:38:36,170 --> 03:39:03,750
Play some of those dialogues. No, I actually, I tried to bring in a, a song. I tried to bring

705
03:39:03,750 --> 03:39:07,829
in a laugh track and it crashed the game. And we all know what happened the last time

706
03:39:07,829 --> 03:39:13,299
this game crashed. It screwed up everything and I had to re-edit everything. So I am

707
03:39:13,299 --> 03:39:21,540
not leaving this screen. Not again. Because even saving it, those of you that weren't here

708
03:39:21,540 --> 03:39:26,899
last time, this doesn't save everything. It just saves this weird kind of configuration

709
03:39:27,299 --> 03:39:35,270
file that keeps the audio and what clips you use. It does not keep all the edits to the clips.

710
03:39:35,829 --> 03:39:41,590
So this is like a, if this is like a crash, it's literally like a landmine. I'm holding

711
03:39:41,590 --> 03:39:52,600
on top. I'm holding a landmine right now. All right. But anyways, um, what the hell?

712
03:39:52,600 --> 03:40:04,299
How am I going to, I need like an electrical sound. Okay. Alarm. ATM. Hey, that's,

713
03:40:07,780 --> 03:40:12,979
that's like, uh, no, uh, uh, don't think so.

714
03:40:18,329 --> 03:40:35,750
There's no record scratch. Let me just see.

715
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:51,110
Was it a metal detector? What is it detecting?

716
03:40:59,700 --> 03:41:05,739
That's really loud. It's just letting you know somebody came in.

717
03:41:09,020 --> 03:41:20,299
That's not going to work. Hold on.

718
03:41:46,569 --> 03:41:56,040
Are they groceries?

719
03:42:10,170 --> 03:42:12,090
Is that like a barcode on their leg of heads?

720
03:42:20,420 --> 03:42:24,659
I need like a wham. I need something to do something violent. That's just

721
03:42:24,659 --> 03:42:26,979
says shit is going down right now.

722
03:42:32,569 --> 03:42:42,409
No, but that's like a, that's like a YouTuber thing. They put like that. Oh, look,

723
03:42:42,489 --> 03:42:51,190
the camera zoomed in and two tenths of a second on my face. Hey, what? What? No,

724
03:42:51,190 --> 03:43:04,780
I'm not doing that. Guys, can we hit 200,000 likes? Can you? I don't think we can.

725
03:43:05,799 --> 03:43:31,700
Yes, we can. He shattered his rib cage. He's got like a bunch of expensive

726
03:43:32,020 --> 03:43:41,270
glass and watches in his bag. Shattered his ribs.

727
03:44:36,440 --> 03:44:39,479
No, no, no, too much, too much, too much, too much, too much.

728
03:44:40,120 --> 03:44:45,639
Too much. Too much. No, don't. That's fine the way it is. I don't need anymore.

729
03:45:31,110 --> 03:46:00,729
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

730
03:46:29,420 --> 03:46:42,299
This is, this needs to come in sooner. I think I'm going to, I'm just going to put this here.

731
03:46:42,299 --> 03:46:48,790
So everyone in chat quiets down. It's going to be removed, but I'll put it in there for one.

732
03:46:48,790 --> 03:47:35,129
Just you get one shot. You get one take. You get one. Disgusting. Revolting. This is,

733
03:47:35,129 --> 03:47:46,899
that's just a disgusting person. Shoveling food down your throat. Perfect.

734
03:47:56,860 --> 03:48:09,020
Oh my God. The game is so loud. I know. I know. I can't turn it down. I have to go

735
03:48:09,020 --> 03:48:13,350
like into the source and turn it down. Hold on. But I can't, I'm so, I'm just,

736
03:48:13,909 --> 03:48:19,190
just, just turn me down. I'm so afraid to alt tab this game. I just am. I'm terrified

737
03:48:19,190 --> 03:48:22,709
to because the last time I've been doing that I crashed it and then we lost everything.

738
03:48:22,709 --> 03:48:26,790
So I'm sorry, but turn your volume down just a little. I'm sorry that I can't do anything for

739
03:48:26,790 --> 03:48:48,020
it. Okay. Where am I? Here. Okay. Yeah. The volume sliders, but I have to remember to turn

740
03:48:48,020 --> 03:48:54,489
these back up. Unfortunately, it's only for what is recorded here. As you'll see,

741
03:48:55,370 --> 03:49:01,129
it doesn't affect any of the stuff in the actual scene. Only affects the music and the

742
03:49:01,129 --> 03:49:08,100
sound effects I'm putting in. So for instance, like when, when they have,

743
03:49:08,100 --> 03:49:11,059
when he gets pitted through the glass, it's not a sound effect I put in.

744
03:49:12,020 --> 03:49:19,059
So I can't, I can't lower it. Unfortunately. Okay. We need a transition. We need something

745
03:49:19,059 --> 03:49:46,309
to happen. I want to pull this, but it's the shift in music between the scene transition

746
03:49:46,309 --> 03:49:52,870
sucks. Yeah. But the, I, I, if, if, if this were like premiere or final cut, you know,

747
03:49:52,870 --> 03:49:59,110
I would put transitions and spread them out and crop them up, but you have to have music

748
03:49:59,110 --> 03:50:07,610
on top of music unless I go into audacity and rerecord every single song. So I wish I could

749
03:50:07,610 --> 03:50:14,709
do that, but yeah, you use the tools. A craftsman only blames his tools if they don't work

750
03:50:14,709 --> 03:50:40,010
as intended out of the box. What was that? Oh shit. Is it like a little ant sound

751
03:50:40,569 --> 03:50:47,110
this is like a little I'm concerned sound nature and animal sounds.

752
03:51:03,670 --> 03:51:10,329
Just get a real animal. I don't know. I never understand this.

753
03:51:10,969 --> 03:51:17,850
This is just a person going, Oh, just record an animal. Just pull it from like a nature website.

754
03:51:22,709 --> 03:51:27,780
Oh, wait a minute. I think we found out transition.

755
03:51:27,780 --> 03:52:33,590
I wish I could just shut this off right here. No, I think it's when they're panicking

756
03:52:52,260 --> 03:52:54,420
thunder kick, thunder knee.

757
03:53:33,879 --> 03:53:56,299
It's Zeus. Yes. That is who this is. That's who you that's who's on the screen right now.

758
03:53:56,299 --> 03:54:01,209
That's who it's always been. And I'm talking even four hours ago. It's been Zeus.

759
03:54:03,940 --> 03:54:12,379
Please just please keep that in mind. It has never been anybody else.

760
03:54:12,379 --> 03:54:18,739
All right. Um, this is all right. I want to add some like creaking sounds

761
03:54:21,270 --> 03:55:35,260
just like that. It wasn't for the beginning part. Jesus. Hey, why would you do that?

762
03:55:35,260 --> 03:55:54,920
I, why would you do that? I want to click this. All right. Fine game.

763
03:55:54,920 --> 03:56:30,329
No, it's not even necessary. I don't think it's necessary.

764
03:56:30,889 --> 03:56:56,229
That's fine. The two is too much. Thunder knee. I know, I know, I know. I'm going,

765
03:56:56,229 --> 03:57:18,260
I'm going, I'm going, I'm getting it. We need a police siren. Lower your volume.

766
03:57:18,260 --> 03:57:46,739
Hope you did. Damn it. Miscellaneous maybe. Is it no siren? No, I thought I saw one.

767
03:57:46,739 --> 03:57:50,459
They're like, uh, no, that's, I thought that's a patrol car.

768
03:57:51,020 --> 03:58:17,909
That is that as close as I'm going to get. All right. Stop.

769
03:58:17,909 --> 03:58:19,989
I got one shot here because I can't move it anywhere else.

770
03:58:19,989 --> 03:59:33,799
Another puke. Here we go. That's my favorite one.

771
03:59:47,659 --> 03:59:59,610
Okay. We need music. So it needs to be, oh my God. Okay. So bang. Right when it changes,

772
03:59:59,690 --> 04:00:28,340
new music. I can't come in. Why can I not add new music? I'm full. Oh, I can zoom out. Okay.

773
04:00:29,139 --> 04:00:33,139
We need, we need where's the, what's it called? The one from when I did this like three years

774
04:00:33,139 --> 04:01:03,510
ago, happy stride. That's the one. It has to be this in the perfect cut. Here we go. Let's

775
04:01:03,510 --> 04:01:23,819
see. Shit. It's gotta be a little bit further because it transitions between them.

776
04:01:23,819 --> 04:02:12,739
Okay. Now we cut to new music back to haunted house. That's so fucking funny.

777
04:02:19,639 --> 04:02:35,049
Keep it. Hold on. Let me, let me just see what happens when I do this.

778
04:02:36,889 --> 04:02:58,950
Well, okay. I'm going to, I'll play it out with it on. Let's see. No,

779
04:02:59,909 --> 04:03:07,319
no, it's not going to have it like that. We need to cut back from happy stride again

780
04:03:07,319 --> 04:03:10,920
at a good cut. And then hell is going to be like heavy metal music.

781
04:03:14,340 --> 04:04:11,500
And then we're done and we can save it and we can watch it closer. It's close a little bit earlier.

782
04:04:12,059 --> 04:04:53,139
It's going to have to be, yeah. All right. That's fine. We can go back to turning these

783
04:04:53,139 --> 04:05:10,780
up again. All right. We're good. I don't know why I forgot that that happens.

784
04:05:17,610 --> 04:05:29,719
I somehow forgot that's what, how this ends. Come on, pull it out.

785
04:05:33,620 --> 04:06:19,989
Ah, no. Why? No, I need the music. I can't preview these. Oh, that's unfortunate.

786
04:06:23,879 --> 04:06:38,250
Does anybody know off hand if there's a, like a heavy metal, the last stand,

787
04:06:39,750 --> 04:06:54,889
the art of war, the last stand. We'll try it. Oh man. Once I get this one. Okay. I gotta,

788
04:06:54,889 --> 04:07:05,079
I have to go back and redo these. That's perfect. I just got 10 more community subs

789
04:07:05,079 --> 04:07:21,059
came in from cyanide. Thank you so much cyanide. 10 more subs from cyanide. You are too kind.

790
04:07:21,620 --> 04:08:07,639
It's right here. Shit. It's not, it's fine. Oh, it really is not good, but I have to change

791
04:08:07,639 --> 04:08:22,500
it all. I have to like go like this and then delete it. Okay. All right. All right. Here we

792
04:08:22,500 --> 04:09:03,000
go. Another one, something else. Record doom off your phone. Doom OST. Just that first

793
04:09:03,079 --> 04:09:17,690
song. Oh, that's not going to work because it has to be layered. That's not going to work.

794
04:09:17,690 --> 04:09:24,520
It's not going to cut over the other music. Yeah. Sorry guys. I gave it a shot.

795
04:09:33,930 --> 04:10:00,459
I'm going to do that one. Dark horizon. Pursuit. Action theme. The art. Try acid bass.

796
04:10:00,459 --> 04:10:06,489
No, that's it. No, it's not that it's only going to play for like eight seconds. I'm going

797
04:10:06,489 --> 04:10:13,350
to try the art of war. What did I do? But I didn't do the art of war last time. Did I?

798
04:10:13,350 --> 04:10:30,440
I did the last stand. No, that was the last stand. Let's try it. Come on.

799
04:10:30,440 --> 04:11:14,700
Good enough. Good enough to end it. Let's see what it sounds like. It's not very, it's not

800
04:11:14,700 --> 04:12:39,350
good. Doesn't fit. It's like the end of a rocko's modern life episode. I think that stays.

801
04:12:39,350 --> 04:12:48,219
There it is. It's done. It's done. There's only one thing that I need to do and that is

802
04:12:48,219 --> 04:13:02,020
I need to scan the people when they come in. That needs to stay constant. Fix the heaven

803
04:13:02,020 --> 04:13:44,260
music. What's wrong with it? Oh, I think this just hold on a minute here. I think the

804
04:13:44,260 --> 04:14:24,309
Armageddon is just going to play. You know what? I think it's good. I think it's good.

805
04:14:24,309 --> 04:14:58,700
I'm done fiddling. I'm done fiddling. I'm done fiddling. It's done. It's done. It's done.

806
04:14:58,700 --> 04:15:14,920
Save it. Yes. Yes. We got it. No crashes. No bullshit. So here's what I'm going to do.

807
04:15:14,920 --> 04:15:21,879
I am going to go pee while it all exports because we don't want to watch it like two,

808
04:15:21,879 --> 04:15:26,840
three, four, five times in a row. Export it and then we'll watch it in all of its glory

809
04:15:26,840 --> 04:15:33,239
when I come back. Custom scanning. Thank you very much. I would have just forgot that.

810
04:15:33,239 --> 04:15:39,899
Thank you for reminding me. Let's do that first. When do people come in? Right here.

811
04:15:39,899 --> 04:15:48,790
But is that, oh, that messes up the music video. I don't want to do that one. It's

812
04:15:48,790 --> 04:16:11,940
supposed to be silent here. Here is where it can pick up. Did anybody come in? They do. No,

813
04:16:17,500 --> 04:16:36,819
no, no. He needs one. No, he doesn't. No, I'm not going to George Lucas this. We're good.

814
04:16:36,819 --> 04:16:43,059
All right. I'm going to export it. I will see you guys in a minute and we'll watch it.

815
04:16:43,059 --> 04:18:44,440
See you soon. All right. I'm back. It's still exporting though. It's going to take like

816
04:18:44,440 --> 04:18:51,350
another two, three minutes. Was there more community subs? We're not. Sign out. How

817
04:18:51,350 --> 04:18:56,680
many community subs is this? Just 10 more and then 10 more before that like 10 minutes ago.

818
04:18:57,319 --> 04:19:14,860
Holy shit. Thank you. Did I fix the audio levels? I brought them back up. They were back. They were

819
04:19:14,860 --> 04:19:28,120
at like what? Like 40%, 40% each essentially. You left in the fart. That's great. I did. Of

820
04:19:28,120 --> 04:19:56,120
course I would have. Oh well. We win. Yeah. The fart has a deeper meaning you plebs. And

821
04:19:56,120 --> 04:19:59,000
then we'll see how much this movie makes. This was like four and a half hours for this.

822
04:19:59,940 --> 04:20:14,549
A little bit less from setting up. Dude, I want this ant falling into the dumpster to be

823
04:20:17,239 --> 04:20:23,059
like my phone background. I want to unlock my phone and see that every day.

824
04:20:33,540 --> 04:20:37,299
I just saw it. I just saw it. You know it's worth seeing again. It's worth seeing like

825
04:20:37,299 --> 04:20:54,180
five more times. All right. It's almost ready. Another like minute almost. Put the ant in your

826
04:20:54,180 --> 04:21:02,520
Twitch description. Yeah. We could do an ant heaven sequel. It's possible. All right.

827
04:21:05,350 --> 04:21:20,090
Movie is exporting. You have to play it through one whole time before you export it. But the

828
04:21:20,090 --> 04:21:27,420
export takes a lot less time because it already played it through. It's finally finished.

829
04:21:29,690 --> 04:21:35,129
Now the audio might not be perfect because when you export these it does a lot of

830
04:21:36,739 --> 04:21:41,059
sometimes it moves stuff around. Sometimes it lags in the middle and moves a clip a little

831
04:21:41,059 --> 04:21:45,299
bit forward. So it might not be perfect the way we've been seeing it in the actual editor.

832
04:21:46,459 --> 04:21:50,379
But we'll see. It might actually play pretty well in like that viewing screen. We'll see.

833
04:22:04,260 --> 04:22:17,379
Is this stream for kids? No. I would say no. I don't think so. I'm about to see it in fast

834
04:22:17,379 --> 04:22:26,010
motion. It was perfect. It was awesome in fast motion too. All right. Let me just make

835
04:22:26,010 --> 04:22:32,819
sure it's there. Let me make sure it actually exists in that folder before I close this window

836
04:22:32,819 --> 04:22:43,030
and then we can watch it in the inside of here. Does it exist? But for this I have to

837
04:22:43,030 --> 04:22:53,260
alt tab. So cross your fingers. I have to go into the movies folder. It's all in the

838
04:22:53,260 --> 04:23:02,819
culmination to right now. Okay. Movies. I see food shop burgers available. I think that's the

839
04:23:02,819 --> 04:23:08,379
one. I'm going to copy that. I'm being so careful. I'm going to paste that onto my

840
04:23:08,379 --> 04:23:13,819
desktop and I'm just going to double click it just to see what it does. I think we're good.

841
04:23:13,819 --> 04:23:28,069
And it was very loud. Yep. I got it. It worked. So let's release the movie and watch the movie

842
04:23:28,069 --> 04:23:49,979
and see what it was worth. All right. That should be it. It's saved. It is ready. Exit.

843
04:23:52,870 --> 04:24:00,870
Release the movie. Okay. A new competition. I'll award three healing crystals to anyone who can

844
04:24:00,870 --> 04:24:08,709
tell me three colors of my aura today. It's not difficult. Down here. Where do I release the

845
04:24:08,709 --> 04:24:28,540
movie? Lead role. Where is it? Canon. PR. Where the hell is the release the movie thing?

846
04:24:31,750 --> 04:24:39,479
Because that's PR and then this is post production. Just do make a bunch of

847
04:24:39,479 --> 04:24:41,799
ads for it. Okay. I'm going to spend like a hundred million dollars on it.

848
04:24:41,879 --> 04:25:09,270
Okay. It's stuck in development. Hell. What? What is this snort? I didn't snort. Oh,

849
04:25:09,270 --> 04:25:15,139
oh, I thought you talked about when I went like, Oh, right. Yeah.

850
04:25:22,340 --> 04:25:36,329
All right. Movie's ready for release. All right. It's been, I don't want to do

851
04:25:36,329 --> 04:25:51,420
any more post production on it. Where's this damn building? Shoot it. Okay. There we go.

852
04:25:51,420 --> 04:25:54,540
Fine. Release. Budget. It's going to be as much as I can.

853
04:25:57,020 --> 04:25:57,500
Here we go.

854
04:25:59,989 --> 04:26:06,469
Crisp quality. Two out of five. This is loud as hell. This is so loud, but it's all right.

855
04:26:06,469 --> 04:26:13,459
Just turn down a little. Repair of sets was superb. Average crew experience awful.

856
04:26:13,459 --> 04:26:20,420
Final movie rating was two out of five stars. And are you ready to watch it?

857
04:26:21,139 --> 04:26:27,590
The movie sucks, but it doesn't, the critics are always just mean.

858
04:26:28,739 --> 04:26:31,780
All right. Turn down a little because it's going to be loud because I had to turn it up.

859
04:26:32,340 --> 04:26:35,979
Are you ready? Let's go.

860
04:30:26,489 --> 04:31:07,940
What did the critics say? Oh my God. One more. One more. Last one more. All right. One more.

861
04:31:07,940 --> 04:31:12,020
One more. And that's it. This time I'm going to be silent for this one. I'm going to just mute.

862
04:31:15,159 --> 04:31:27,430
If that ant seriously into the dumpster is, I love it so much. All right. First of all,

863
04:31:27,430 --> 04:31:32,819
Phylactery Lich gave another $50. And they said I'm back. That was hilarious. I'm glad

864
04:31:32,819 --> 04:31:39,420
you think so. This game's a lot of fun. All right. I'm going to mute. Here it comes. Encore.

865
04:31:39,420 --> 04:31:41,819
Last one. Here we go.

866
04:34:20,700 --> 04:35:57,340
There it is. All right. You've got a silent clip of it. Ant Encore. Yeah, that was a fire ant.

867
04:35:59,500 --> 04:36:11,290
All right. Let's see. Success. Stunt rating. Difficulty. They were no success. Scene 26.

868
04:36:12,009 --> 04:36:18,549
That's because they were doing their own stunts. Some of the extras did stunts better than the

869
04:36:18,549 --> 04:36:34,970
actors. Uh, it was $266,000? Or is that $266? No, it can't be, right? This wasn't $2.84.

870
04:36:40,779 --> 04:36:56,919
This was $266. Strange. Pee Pants Liquidated certainly shows some ability here and should

871
04:36:56,919 --> 04:37:02,970
consider producing a third comedy flick. Jax really let this movie down. The crew

872
04:37:02,970 --> 04:37:07,610
what a bunch of incompetent inexperienced cretins. Jax's stinking mood could well have

873
04:37:07,610 --> 04:37:15,849
affected his performance here. Movie packed with originality. The acting was decidedly average.

874
04:37:16,650 --> 04:37:22,860
The set scenes in this movie were clearly in superb condition. Why did I make it a comedy?

875
04:37:24,150 --> 04:37:38,020
Because four hours ago, this was a different movie. Oh, there it is.

876
04:37:38,259 --> 04:37:52,180
The president says he will not lose. Currently, the sand is making no comment.

877
04:37:52,900 --> 04:37:58,740
I'm going to very quickly. I'm going to turn it down because it is loud. It's very loud.

878
04:37:59,939 --> 04:38:06,580
And guys, I'm sorry to say that is going to conclude the stream because

879
04:38:07,540 --> 04:38:18,090
I have to get on an airplane. I wanted to go for a good five hours before

880
04:38:19,049 --> 04:38:27,259
leaving. I am going to be gone for a week. I've got a lot of work to do to work on this

881
04:38:27,259 --> 04:38:34,069
Doug Tank carnival stream. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then just stay tuned.

882
04:38:36,380 --> 04:38:39,340
I'm going to visit family and I'm going to do a bunch of work on this stream.

883
04:38:42,569 --> 04:38:59,930
So I will see you guys in a week. Going back to Boston. Yep. Because on top of just seeing

884
04:38:59,930 --> 04:39:06,409
family, I saw my mother, as you all know, a couple months ago. But some of my immediate

885
04:39:06,409 --> 04:39:13,849
and extended family are coming in and some of my siblings are moving across the country,

886
04:39:13,849 --> 04:39:20,090
kind of like I did. And this is the last time that we'll probably all see each other.

887
04:39:20,889 --> 04:39:27,689
In a very, very, very long time. So I feel like I kind of took the opportunity to come back

888
04:39:28,409 --> 04:39:39,819
because I obviously want to see some of these people for the last time in a while. So I will

889
04:39:39,819 --> 04:39:49,419
see you all next week. Keep your eye on the sus. Don't do anything crazy without me. Behave.

890
04:39:51,979 --> 04:39:55,740
I'm just gonna stick around for the 20 minutes and so we'll do the bits and the subs and

891
04:39:55,740 --> 04:40:03,259
everything. Hope you enjoyed. The movies is always a ton of fun. I still have a bunch of

892
04:40:04,500 --> 04:40:08,740
other characters and other things we could do. If you'd like to see it again,

893
04:40:09,380 --> 04:40:23,990
we'll probably do it again because it is too much fun to play this. Anywho, I'm going to

894
04:40:23,990 --> 04:40:32,069
turn this off. I'm going to transition to the outro. Take care, guys. I think

895
04:40:32,069 --> 04:40:37,509
you're just taking off. Hopefully we see you again soon. See you next week. Those of you

896
04:40:37,509 --> 04:40:47,909
sticking around, we've got some bits to do. Why don't we do them right now? Let's go back.

897
04:40:47,909 --> 04:40:56,139
There was a lot of money today. A lot of high denomination bit donations and subs.

898
04:40:58,310 --> 04:41:09,110
You guys are very, very, very kind to me. Thank you. Let's go back to earlier this afternoon.

899
04:41:10,069 --> 04:41:17,209
7layerwario gave $10. Hey, my partner Wes has been a big fan of yours for a while.

900
04:41:17,209 --> 04:41:23,400
Could you say hello? Thanks for everything. Hello, Wes. Hope you're having a good day, Wes.

901
04:41:23,959 --> 04:41:35,049
How the heck are you? And then I put my hand out. Here we go. Hey, what's up, man?

902
04:41:35,689 --> 04:41:48,419
Hey, what's up? But thank you for the $10. I really appreciate it. We also had

903
04:41:49,400 --> 04:42:06,020
a ton of community subs. Herbert1234 gave $20. Deddo, Deddo, Deddo. $20. We had $50 from

904
04:42:06,020 --> 04:42:16,330
Bakken. $50 from Phylactery. $450 total from Phylactery. Very, very generous. Thank you,

905
04:42:16,330 --> 04:42:26,970
guys. We also had more community subs from campfkaren for $5. Waity, thanks for the $5.

906
04:42:26,970 --> 04:42:35,580
Buxwaity or Waty, when is there going to be an auto stream? I don't think I'll ever have like

907
04:42:35,580 --> 04:42:45,080
a just a purely auto stream. He shows up from time to time on camera. He'll poke his head in

908
04:42:45,080 --> 04:42:55,139
every now and again. But thank you for the $5. Jerma lied and didn't draw sticks.

909
04:42:56,040 --> 04:43:03,189
Thanks for the $2.50. Speaking of Burger King, play those three Burger King games

910
04:43:03,189 --> 04:43:09,189
that are on the Xbox. Sneak King, Big Bumpin' and Pocket Bike. They were surprisingly fun.

911
04:43:12,060 --> 04:43:18,459
Well, we didn't, there was no talk of Burger King today, but I mean, if we were to talk

912
04:43:18,459 --> 04:43:26,810
about Burger King at some point, then yeah, I mean, maybe I would try them. I do remember

913
04:43:26,810 --> 04:43:35,720
those games, though, especially Sneak King. Thank you, though. Thank you, Saturnian Ocean

914
04:43:36,279 --> 04:43:41,990
for the $15. Last week, I got my wisdom teeth removed. They finished in about 30 minutes,

915
04:43:41,990 --> 04:43:46,069
which was pretty cool. Too bad I woke up in the middle of them ripping out a tooth.

916
04:43:46,709 --> 04:43:49,750
It wasn't great. Anyway, keep up the good work, Jerma Saturn.

917
04:43:50,709 --> 04:44:01,560
Uh, yeah, that does not sound very fun. Did your face swell up? Did you look like a chipmunk?

918
04:44:03,130 --> 04:44:08,810
That happened to me. It looked like I had, um, you know when a hamster stuffs like

919
04:44:08,810 --> 04:44:17,369
seeds in his mouth. It's crazy how that works. You just have this inflated face.

920
04:44:19,369 --> 04:44:26,060
How does the human body repair itself like that? That insane, intense amount of trauma

921
04:44:26,060 --> 04:44:34,659
that we can have on our bodies and then be fine in less than a couple weeks. It's crazy.

922
04:44:41,240 --> 04:44:45,479
The mouth is literally the fastest healing part of the body. It just seems so strange.

923
04:44:48,200 --> 04:44:55,669
Human beings, man. Imagine living without any healing. Yeah, imagine if we just didn't

924
04:44:55,669 --> 04:45:00,599
self-repair ourselves. If you got a cut on your finger and it's there for life,

925
04:45:00,599 --> 04:45:10,740
what do you do? It's just wild. Well, you, you'd probably, yeah, we'd probably just die.

926
04:45:16,040 --> 04:45:21,270
Well, that's not good. But anyways, now hopefully the procedure went well.

927
04:45:22,169 --> 04:45:28,659
Thank you for the $15, uh, Saturnian. It was last week, but hopefully you're still in a

928
04:45:28,659 --> 04:45:37,669
decent recovery here. Thank you for the $15. Gordon Burbman. Thank you, Gordon Burbman,

929
04:45:37,669 --> 04:45:43,819
for the 20 bucks. $20. They say, hey, Jerma, I finally managed to catch you streaming.

930
04:45:43,819 --> 04:45:47,900
Pretty hard to do over here in Europe. I've been watching your content for at least five

931
04:45:47,900 --> 04:45:51,979
years. I just want to say thanks for all the laughs. Too many times I've been this close

932
04:45:51,979 --> 04:45:59,750
to burger boy throwing up from the laughter. Here's to more years to come. Well, welcome

933
04:45:59,750 --> 04:46:08,869
from the EU. I've had a couple of EU friendly streams this last two weeks, haven't I? I've

934
04:46:08,869 --> 04:46:16,950
been getting up early is what's been happening. But yeah, um, five years is a long time. I've been

935
04:46:16,950 --> 04:46:25,220
doing this for eight. Once it gets to 10, that's a, I mean, that's less than two years. Think

936
04:46:25,220 --> 04:46:33,560
about that. A full 10 years of doing stuff on the internet. You don't have to have like a

937
04:46:33,560 --> 04:46:48,919
party. Here comes the 10th sneeze. But thank you Gordon Burbman. Uh, I also from these

938
04:46:48,919 --> 04:46:53,529
streams have almost burger boy thrown up because some of these games are just so funny.

939
04:46:53,529 --> 04:46:57,369
They're just so odd and so interesting. So I think you can't help yourself sometimes.

940
04:46:59,720 --> 04:47:07,209
Uh, Siroc, Sirockey Q. Thanks for the $12 and 50 cents. E-clown streamer Jerma is being

941
04:47:07,209 --> 04:47:12,810
sued for defamation by Burger King. Jerma is also suspect of kidnapping, murdering,

942
04:47:12,810 --> 04:47:16,650
money laundering, a clown car without a license, grand theft, ballooning,

943
04:47:16,650 --> 04:47:21,049
cannibalism, uh, slavery, video game, privacy, tax evasion. I'm not accused of any

944
04:47:21,049 --> 04:47:24,970
of those things. I don't know where you're getting the word burger and then the other

945
04:47:24,970 --> 04:47:35,529
word that is also King. I don't know where you're getting those from. Those are two words

946
04:47:36,169 --> 04:47:41,130
that back to back could mean something, but I did not make any references to those two words

947
04:47:41,130 --> 04:47:46,009
that are connected together to form a potential corporate entity. I'd never talked about it.

948
04:47:47,959 --> 04:47:54,419
On this stream today, we had old man with crown who was Zeus. That was Zeus.

949
04:47:55,529 --> 04:48:00,009
I, and people in the chat were saying, is what is this supposed to be? Is this something about

950
04:48:00,009 --> 04:48:03,209
the King? And I'm like, no, no, no, no, this is, this is old man with crown Zeus.

951
04:48:05,020 --> 04:48:11,220
I corrected everybody in the chat at least a few times, but thank you for the 250.

952
04:48:11,779 --> 04:48:16,860
Hey, Reapers Reviews. Thanks for $15, Reapers. Hey, Jerma, just want to say I love your

953
04:48:16,860 --> 04:48:21,340
content and was introduced to you through a friend. Keep doing you also. When is your

954
04:48:21,340 --> 04:48:29,159
memoir coming out? It already did come up. It was like the children's snake book thing.

955
04:48:29,799 --> 04:48:38,380
I would just put my name on that and say this is the memoir. Otherwise,

956
04:48:39,099 --> 04:48:52,840
that was such a fucked up stream. It's over. Did he ever revisit the E3 movie? I did. In fact,

957
04:48:52,840 --> 04:48:56,360
at the very beginning of the stream, if you watch the VOD, if you open up that VOD,

958
04:48:56,919 --> 04:49:04,169
the first thing we do is we watch the edited E3 presentation. I did that earlier. It was done

959
04:49:04,169 --> 04:49:08,330
before the stream started. I hope you enjoy it because it is an absolute shit show,

960
04:49:09,049 --> 04:49:15,770
but thank you. Reapers Reviews and thanks to your friend for introducing you to me.

961
04:49:18,520 --> 04:49:25,830
Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $5. $5 from Freudian. Hey, Jerma, just wanted to wish you

962
04:49:25,830 --> 04:49:29,590
well on your break. Hope the behind the scenes work on the dunk tank proves fruitful.

963
04:49:29,590 --> 04:49:35,080
Have a good weekend, Jerma Hart. I'm gonna do my best. I'm gonna do my absolute best.

964
04:49:39,240 --> 04:49:48,220
Hopefully it's worth it. It should be at least interesting. It's worth a try. Back in,

965
04:49:48,220 --> 04:49:57,000
I missed this earlier, but Back in gave $100 and $50. So sorry I missed this earlier. I was

966
04:49:57,000 --> 04:50:00,119
probably locked in doing something, but $100 from Back in. Thank you so much.

967
04:50:01,000 --> 04:50:05,299
Been watching you for so long since early YouTube. My perception of time is degrading

968
04:50:05,299 --> 04:50:09,060
more and more I feel, but I will never forget the amount of time you brought

969
04:50:09,060 --> 04:50:14,020
joy to my life throughout the years. Keep doing you, Boomer, Jerma Hart. PS,

970
04:50:14,020 --> 04:50:21,540
this Burger King conflict movie is too violent. It's not, it's not those things.

971
04:50:21,540 --> 04:50:28,009
It is a restaurant. It was first of all, it's a pizzeria. I don't know any two words connected

972
04:50:28,009 --> 04:50:32,250
to make a corporate entity with a medieval king involved. I don't know of any pizzeria

973
04:50:32,250 --> 04:50:40,020
that has that on there named. So I first, that's the number one, but it wasn't,

974
04:50:40,020 --> 04:50:49,459
that wasn't even that violent. It was just, I mean, it kind of was, but that's a lot of

975
04:50:49,459 --> 04:50:55,380
money. $150 in one stream is a lot of money to give anybody. So thank you back in.

976
04:50:56,099 --> 04:51:09,299
Hope you enjoy yourself. Hey, Freudian already got you, but $5. Thank you again.

977
04:51:10,099 --> 04:51:23,959
We also had, it was a lot of community subs. My stream labs is just a fucking,

978
04:51:23,959 --> 04:51:29,959
just huge, huge amount of them. You guys are fucking awesome. Thank you.

979
04:51:30,840 --> 04:51:36,500
You guys are too much. Uh, smelly boy. Thanks for the 250. Please make a scrambled egg

980
04:51:36,500 --> 04:51:45,540
breakfast on stream. I'll probably do a cooking stream eventually here. I got to be careful

981
04:51:45,540 --> 04:51:50,259
though, cause I want to do some dumb joke and like, I'll like light the pot pan on fire or

982
04:51:50,259 --> 04:52:04,580
something. It would be bad. It's like the one thing holding me back, but Keldo's thanks

983
04:52:04,580 --> 04:52:09,340
for the $3. Uh, since you've listened to Red Vox, what songs are your favorite? Also,

984
04:52:09,340 --> 04:52:17,849
what do you think about Jerma Fox? Uh, let me see Jerma Fox. Jerma Fox is from,

985
04:52:17,849 --> 04:52:29,319
is Jerma Chomp, but a Fox. I think it's pretty cool. I think it's pretty awesome actually.

986
04:52:29,959 --> 04:52:37,240
It's cute. It's cute. It's cute. What's cute. I see people writing in the chat. Why, uh,

987
04:52:38,040 --> 04:52:44,040
me burning my house down would be, is like LOL quotes funny. I actually had a stream idea

988
04:52:44,040 --> 04:52:50,009
where I was doing a cooking show and why would I even tell you this? Cause it could still

989
04:52:50,009 --> 04:52:57,110
happen eventually. There's like a whole elaborate thing here. I don't like burn anything down,

990
04:52:57,909 --> 04:53:08,860
but there was an elaborate scheme I was going to do. No, no, no, no, not scheme. That's the

991
04:53:08,860 --> 04:53:17,029
wrong word. But anyways, Vinny is a very talented musician. He takes his music very

992
04:53:17,029 --> 04:53:47,400
seriously and shows. Let me just show you. Blood bagels was blood bagel. Give Fox, give Fox,

993
04:53:47,400 --> 04:54:10,180
give Fox. I'm not going to give Fox. Why did I say give Fox three times? Cause everyone's

994
04:54:10,180 --> 04:54:56,299
screaming it. It's a good shit, ain't it? It's very good. Go get it, go listen to it,

995
04:54:56,299 --> 04:55:09,720
go support it. I'm going to get content claimed by Vinny. What if he just like

996
04:55:09,720 --> 04:55:15,110
dropped the fucking hammer on me and like ruined me and like took me to court and like took

997
04:55:15,110 --> 04:55:30,659
every, everything. And I mean everything. I'm like, I ended up like the no house, no nothing.

998
04:55:30,659 --> 04:55:32,819
And he's just, and he's just like laughing on stream afterwards,

999
04:55:42,119 --> 04:55:51,909
but thank you. Kaldos for the $3. And that's probably the, this is probably two more songs

1000
04:55:51,909 --> 04:56:05,590
that I think are really good on that album, but are in that catalog, but thank you for

1001
04:56:05,590 --> 04:56:18,729
$3. Vinny's a good dude. You hate the rest of the album. No, I'm going to make sure this is like,

1002
04:56:18,729 --> 04:56:33,979
you can't like clip me out of context there. Like I know it's going to be like,

1003
04:56:33,979 --> 04:56:39,500
here's a few of eight seconds of a sentence you said. Let's get that last four seconds

1004
04:56:39,500 --> 04:56:43,180
and then get cut it right. Perfect. Fade it in a little. So it sounds more natural. Add

1005
04:56:43,180 --> 04:56:48,060
some more background music to background sounds and then fade the end out and then,

1006
04:56:48,060 --> 04:56:51,020
you know, change it a little. You guys, I know how talented some of you guys can be.

1007
04:56:52,790 --> 04:57:04,889
I'm not an idiot. What's this? What's this one? What happened? What's this? Oh, fuck. Oh,

1008
04:57:04,889 --> 04:57:10,569
what happened? What happened? Hey, RoboLamp, thanks for the 10 bucks. Germa Heart. Hey,

1009
04:57:10,569 --> 04:57:17,509
thank you. Germa Heart back to you as well. Thanks for the $10. We have a official Burger

1010
04:57:17,509 --> 04:57:23,240
King, $2.50. This is not a real account. I want to make sure that this is very clear.

1011
04:57:24,680 --> 04:57:33,770
This is not real. Okay, thank you, official Zeus Old Man Crown for the $2.50.

1012
04:57:34,490 --> 04:57:38,009

1018
04:58:05,290 --> 04:58:10,569
person that's a medieval crown has on their head in a pizza restaurant. Thank you.

1019
04:58:13,189 --> 04:58:20,299
I appreciate it. Thanks for the $2.50. Thank you C4G for the $2.50. Is this you? Is this you?

1020
04:58:22,939 --> 04:58:35,799
Um, no, no, it's not me. But thank you for the $2.50. Appreciate it. Cyanide gave so many subs.

1021
04:58:35,799 --> 04:58:43,619
How many subs did Cyanide Zero give today? It has to be more than 50 to 100. It has to be.

1022
04:58:50,580 --> 04:59:01,700
That's a lot. Thank you Cyanide. If you're still here. Oh, we also had a 0.9 for the $5.

1023
04:59:03,669 --> 04:59:06,950
Stop listening to the one guy in chat. This is pure gold.

1024
04:59:09,459 --> 04:59:13,779
No, I thought I was removing things and changing and checking that. Guys,

1025
04:59:13,779 --> 04:59:19,880
that's how I used to make videos. I would sit there meticulously for 10 straight hours

1026
04:59:21,110 --> 04:59:25,909
on the same thing. No, no, no, no, no. I don't like that. I gotta move that forward a little.

1027
04:59:25,909 --> 04:59:29,349
Look at this. No, I don't like it. Change discolete that whole to get rid of the whole

1028
04:59:29,349 --> 04:59:39,180
clip. I hate it. I used to do that all the time. I would just George Lucas the same video

1029
04:59:39,180 --> 04:59:55,430
like 10 times. Imagine editing. I know, really, right? But thank you, 0.9. Jack Raff, thanks for

1030
04:59:55,430 --> 04:59:58,549
the $2.50. Do you ever think you'll be able to play The Neverhood on stream? Any other games

1031
04:59:58,549 --> 05:00:04,069
you grew up with that you'd like to revisit? Maybe. The Neverhood's kind of odd though,

1032
05:00:04,069 --> 05:00:08,069
because from every time I've ever gone back and played it, because there's never been a

1033
05:00:08,069 --> 05:00:14,549
remaster. There's never been an updated version of that game. It's just the brick

1034
05:00:14,549 --> 05:00:21,979
Windows 95 version that I've tried to run on various machines over the years. And sometimes

1035
05:00:21,979 --> 05:00:25,180
you can get it to work for a little while. But there's a very specific point in that game

1036
05:00:25,180 --> 05:00:30,939
that's about 50 to 60% of the way through the game that you cannot physically get through.

1037
05:00:30,939 --> 05:00:35,979
You have to like go download a save file that goes past this one point to be able to continue

1038
05:00:35,979 --> 05:00:55,939
to play it. Or run it in a Windows 95 virtual machine. And another reason why, I've played

1039
05:00:55,939 --> 05:01:05,450
through that game more than 10 to 20 times. So I would really just, it's the same reason why

1040
05:01:05,450 --> 05:01:09,049
I haven't really played Bloodborne or anything, because it's just like, hey, remember this part?

1041
05:01:09,049 --> 05:01:11,450
Hey, remember this part? Hey, do you remember this part? I remember this part. You're gonna

1042
05:01:11,450 --> 05:01:16,099
like this part. Hey, I remember this part. But there's something to be said to have like a fun

1043
05:01:16,099 --> 05:01:25,770
nostalgic stream like that. I'm not sure I would do something like Bloodborne though,

1044
05:01:25,770 --> 05:01:38,900
because that would take a long time. I'm open to it though. Kalula Sniper, thanks for the

1045
05:01:38,900 --> 05:01:45,049
five dollars, Kalula Sniper. Hey, Jeremy, I just got my two-year sub badge. Thank you for that.

1046
05:01:45,610 --> 05:01:49,610
The movie streams are the first I ever watched live, so it's great seeing you come back to

1047
05:01:49,610 --> 05:01:56,380
this game. Thanks for staying awesome all these years. Much love. I'm just glad that I could

1048
05:01:56,380 --> 05:01:59,659
still have fun with it. One of the reasons why I don't like revisiting old things that

1049
05:01:59,659 --> 05:02:04,860
I've done or doing the same thing more than a few times is because I feel like the magic won't be

1050
05:02:04,860 --> 05:02:14,549
there. After I stream a certain stream or stream a certain thing three, four plus times, it's

1051
05:02:14,549 --> 05:02:18,470
almost like going back to it is like, hey, let me like go make that magic happen again.

1052
05:02:22,970 --> 05:02:29,479
So it's not necessarily that I don't want to. It's just it has to be organic. It has to

1053
05:02:29,479 --> 05:02:35,900
be something that I feel like doing and know that I want to go back to. The same kind of

1054
05:02:35,900 --> 05:02:40,869
thing happened with Sims 4, but enough time went by where that second time that I did it was

1055
05:02:41,430 --> 05:02:45,659
just as fun as the first time. But I wouldn't want to be one of those people that,

1056
05:02:46,659 --> 05:02:53,240
hey, how much fun have I had on these movie streams? All right, I'm going to do this like

1057
05:02:53,240 --> 05:02:58,279
I'm going to do this for the next like two months. I would never do it. I would just

1058
05:02:58,279 --> 05:03:12,700
lose it. Magic would be gone. So I guess that's that's the answer, right? The answer to

1059
05:03:12,700 --> 05:03:17,740
the question that you did not even ask that I you made a comment and then I asked a question.

1060
05:03:19,130 --> 05:03:22,250
But thank you. I do like going back to things if it's worth going back to.

1061
05:03:25,529 --> 05:03:30,889
Hey, pigeon. Thanks for the 250 pigeon. Hey, I don't know if anyone's asked this you

1062
05:03:30,889 --> 05:03:34,729
they asked you this yet. But are you coming to TwitchCon in San Diego?

1063
05:03:34,729 --> 05:03:37,689
You've always been my idol and I'd love to be able to meet you.

1064
05:03:41,750 --> 05:03:52,939
Um, let me think. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. But I don't like here's the thing about

1065
05:03:52,939 --> 05:03:59,159
TwitchCon. I kind of just like float around at TwitchCon. I don't do like any official

1066
05:03:59,159 --> 05:04:06,180
meeting greets or anything. You kind of have to like find me. I've done I tweet like kind of

1067
05:04:06,180 --> 05:04:10,810
like, hey, I'm in front of the convention center for a half an hour. So I don't really

1068
05:04:11,529 --> 05:04:16,810
do any of the big panels or anything. I'm not going to do. I've wanted to do like a panel

1069
05:04:16,810 --> 05:04:20,569
before maybe. But I don't know if they'd want me to do it because that would kind of ruin

1070
05:04:20,569 --> 05:04:27,509
everything. I was thinking about doing a or seeing if they'd let me do a panel where

1071
05:04:27,509 --> 05:04:33,540
I just put up like slides of like a vacation or something. And like the name of the stream

1072
05:04:33,540 --> 05:04:38,900
is like how to make your brand how to make your brand easier to consume with viewers.

1073
05:04:39,459 --> 05:04:49,560
And I just talk about where I went on Disney. I don't even mention the word Twitch. I don't

1074
05:04:49,560 --> 05:04:56,840
mention like engagements. Nothing. I just show slides. But I feel like they would probably

1075
05:04:56,840 --> 05:05:04,500
be like, yeah, so you lied to us. And I'd be like, yeah, well, I'm a fucking liar.

1076
05:05:04,500 --> 05:05:09,299
Have you seen the haven't you seen 38% of every username in my channel?

1077
05:05:09,299 --> 05:05:24,840
You should have known this. But this this, I probably will. I don't let's put it this way.

1078
05:05:24,840 --> 05:05:31,580
I don't have a reason not to go. I'm not moving. Although I've talked about it. You

1079
05:05:31,580 --> 05:05:38,150
know, I was thinking about it. But I probably won't not moving not really spending a bunch of

1080
05:05:38,389 --> 05:05:47,139
that's not true. That is completely incorrect. You know, I'm not spending a bunch of money

1081
05:05:47,139 --> 05:05:52,900
or anything. I'm just like, actively setting up a fucking carnival stream, you know,

1082
05:05:54,259 --> 05:06:03,590
I'm not spending any money. But there's really no reason for me not to go.

1083
05:06:04,150 --> 05:06:17,189
I probably will. Moving to where I'd stay in Vegas, just if the internet was still an issue.

1084
05:06:18,900 --> 05:06:32,860
I would just go somewhere else. But yeah, it's not really on the cards at the moment.

1085
05:06:32,860 --> 05:06:39,799
I will be on the west coast probably for at least the next 10 years. I'll probably be in

1086
05:06:39,799 --> 05:06:46,729
Vegas for at least three to five, I would assume maybe potentially, I don't think I want to live

1087
05:06:46,729 --> 05:07:05,610
in California. I want to stay in this probably Southwest area for a while. Yeah, I'll be in

1088
05:07:05,610 --> 05:07:14,060
Vegas for a while. Why not California? California is expensive. It is very expensive, especially

1089
05:07:14,060 --> 05:07:20,380
a lot of the places that I would want to live. Hey, let's move to Los Angeles. Oh, move to

1090
05:07:20,380 --> 05:07:26,779
wait a minute. How many thousands of dollars a month is it to live in like a one or two bedroom

1091
05:07:26,779 --> 05:07:40,500
like apartment in LA? What's that again? How much was that? No, I like Las Vegas.

1092
05:07:43,159 --> 05:07:49,849
It speaks to me. It just does. But Sara Bellis, thanks for the $11 Sara Bellis. No

1093
05:07:49,849 --> 05:07:56,919
message, just $11. Thank you. Let's get the credits rolling here. And we'll see all those

1094
05:07:56,919 --> 05:08:09,139
community subs gambling. No, it's nothing to do with gambling. That's do it. I'm saying

1095
05:08:09,779 --> 05:08:14,569
there's nothing to do with gambling. It has to do with I'm tapping my foot to

1096
05:08:15,209 --> 05:08:27,349
nothing. That's not gambling. Decide I just give another $100.

1097
05:08:27,830 --> 05:08:40,860
Yeah, they did cyanide with another $100. Holy shit. Hey, Gerber, been a fan for a long

1098
05:08:40,860 --> 05:08:44,860
while haven't been able to give back for all the joy you brought to my life. I'm at a point

1099
05:08:44,860 --> 05:08:48,220
in my life where I can donate and contribute back to the community. I love you'll be missed

1100
05:08:48,220 --> 05:08:53,259
this week. Yes, I might change my name to Gerber lied about level up lounge. If you

1101
05:08:53,259 --> 05:09:03,189
don't actually do it. Let's let me do the carnival first. Okay. And let me see how much

1102
05:09:03,189 --> 05:09:08,310
money is in my like literal Monopoly man open them and have like the bugs come out

1103
05:09:08,310 --> 05:09:11,830
because there's nothing in there. Let me let me get this done first and we'll see.

1104
05:09:12,630 --> 05:09:21,290
He was so drunk. No, I really did want to do that. I thought it was really fun idea.

1105
05:09:31,400 --> 05:09:37,270
Drunk promises. No, they're not drunk promises. They were drunk thoughts.

1106
05:09:40,740 --> 05:09:52,729
They were drunk thoughts. But if you want to throw this kind of money down sign, I'm

1107
05:09:52,729 --> 05:09:58,709
glad to take it. I just hope you get you're comfortable doing it. And always know that

1108
05:09:58,709 --> 05:10:06,259
there is no real monetary obligation to hang out here and kind of care about this channel

1109
05:10:06,259 --> 05:10:12,200
and stuff. I just hope everybody knows that. But I really do. That's a lot of money. I

1110
05:10:12,200 --> 05:10:24,840
really appreciate it. I will try to put it to good use. Thank you. We also had Oh,

1111
05:10:24,840 --> 05:10:28,759
the credits, right? I want to get those rolling because they're going to fly by

1112
05:10:31,500 --> 05:10:41,959
lots of community subs tonight. Thank you. All of you. The LUL boys. We also had

1113
05:10:42,759 --> 05:10:59,830
and we had Espada Escarlata. $2.50. Thank you, Espada. Just want to show some more love. I'm

1114
05:10:59,830 --> 05:11:04,150
starting a job with the census in a month. It's been really rough trying to find work. And

1115
05:11:04,150 --> 05:11:08,069
like a lot of people say, your streams are a huge mood lift for me. Oh, and I hope you

1116
05:11:08,069 --> 05:11:12,869
have a good visit home. This year will hopefully be my last at home before I head out to Colorado.

1117
05:11:13,590 --> 05:11:25,369
Having moved back here and hating it. Colorado is a great state. A lot of interesting things

1118
05:11:25,369 --> 05:11:34,229
going on. Colorado was actually one of the states that I was thinking of moving to as

1119
05:11:34,229 --> 05:11:42,310
well. This little section of the US, this like Colorado, Nevada, even parts of Arizona

1120
05:11:42,310 --> 05:11:56,779
into like, I like, I like this area. Oregon has the coast though. Yeah, it's always Washington,

1121
05:11:58,169 --> 05:12:03,930
California. But if you don't really care about the water, if you don't really care about beaches

1122
05:12:03,930 --> 05:12:09,819
and, you know, big bodies of water and being on the ocean or whatever, which I don't really

1123
05:12:09,819 --> 05:12:16,069
doesn't bother me that much. That's why I can tolerate the landlocked kind of desert that

1124
05:12:16,069 --> 05:12:22,169
is Vegas because there is its own charm. Vegas has a lot of awesome mountains. They

1125
05:12:22,169 --> 05:12:29,340
have a lot of great, great wildlife preserves and everything. The Grand Canyon is really not

1126
05:12:29,340 --> 05:12:38,970
that far away from here. You really like to gloat about Vegas an awful lot. I love this place.

1127
05:12:40,099 --> 05:12:47,479
Vegas is awesome. I will talk the shit up of this place. I will talk up Vegas every day.

1128
05:12:53,610 --> 05:12:57,290
Australia is better than Vegas. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not.

1129
05:12:57,290 --> 05:13:18,220
That's what I'm saying. Do I have any complaints? Yeah. Yeah, there is like one

1130
05:13:18,220 --> 05:13:26,119
major complaint about Vegas. People around here is the only complaint I really have.

1131
05:13:26,840 --> 05:13:33,159
I love everything about Las Vegas and this portion of Nevada especially. But people

1132
05:13:33,159 --> 05:13:43,319
drive around here like fucking lunatics, fucking lunatics. And that's not just like a rumor meme.

1133
05:13:44,439 --> 05:13:53,060
Unfortunately, like sad and horribly enough, I've seen more horrendous car crashes

1134
05:13:53,060 --> 05:13:57,060
on the roads out here than ever, ever, ever before in any place I've ever been.

1135
05:13:57,619 --> 05:14:04,740
There is a terrible fucking car wreck on the street in Vegas once a week it seems. Like

1136
05:14:04,740 --> 05:14:09,060
we'll just be driving around and it's like, oh, there's another like car fucking wreck over

1137
05:14:09,060 --> 05:14:20,790
there. It's horrible. And Massachusetts, that was like maybe once every year, once a year,

1138
05:14:21,430 --> 05:14:29,400
once every maybe couple years driving around every day would you see a really bad pile up.

1139
05:14:29,400 --> 05:14:37,080
It's a bi-weekly experience out here. So just got to be careful on the roads then. That's

1140
05:14:37,080 --> 05:14:41,880
why the insurance insurance is high out here. Just because it's people up fucking drive around

1141
05:14:41,959 --> 05:14:50,299
like crazy people out here. That's the entire west coast in general. Maybe. This is my first

1142
05:14:50,299 --> 05:15:04,459
experience with it. Just don't leave your house. And you've been on the New York,

1143
05:15:04,459 --> 05:15:14,470
New York roller coaster. I have. It's pretty awesome actually. Yeah, but we've been very

1144
05:15:14,470 --> 05:15:22,090
careful when we drive around out here just because it's wild. But no, no, that's probably

1145
05:15:22,090 --> 05:15:28,259
it. That's the only real complaint that I've really had since being here. Thank you, Jamie.

1146
05:15:28,819 --> 05:15:34,979
KW for five dollars. They say Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100. Hi,

1147
05:15:34,979 --> 05:15:53,290
Jerma. Love you. Thank you so much. What kind of car do I drive? I drive a Hummer. It's the

1148
05:15:53,290 --> 05:16:02,759
double XL version. And I put like the seat up really high and I like fucking, I love just

1149
05:16:02,759 --> 05:16:19,319
being like big on the road. No, I don't drive a Hummer. Hummers are the types of cars that

1150
05:16:19,319 --> 05:16:26,279
you fill that gas tank. And if you drive to the grocery store, you use half a tank of gas.

1151
05:16:26,919 --> 05:16:44,840
You probably drive a 2010 Toyota. I do not. I do not. What a little mystery what my car is.

1152
05:16:44,840 --> 05:16:50,279
What kind of car do I drive? What a mystery this is for you guys. Maybe one day you find out

1153
05:16:52,310 --> 05:17:09,349
what do I drive for a car? It's not a Tesla. A clown car. I bet it's a Honda.

1154
05:17:12,490 --> 05:17:26,220
No, I'll tell you what I drive. I drive. Are you ready? I'll tell you the brand. I drive a

1155
05:17:26,220 --> 05:17:54,419
Toyota Prius. That is also not true. I do not drive a Prius. That's a 100% lie. I drive a

1156
05:17:55,830 --> 05:18:13,209
Honda Civic. It's also not true. I'm just doing this thing where I think somebody already

1157
05:18:13,209 --> 05:18:19,560
said it. Whatever car I say, people are just going to be laughing. It doesn't matter what it

1158
05:18:19,560 --> 05:18:28,979
is. It doesn't matter what car it is. Okay, guys, I drive. I drive. I'll be honest. I drive.

1159
05:18:29,779 --> 05:18:49,639
I drive a BMW 3 Series. By the way, one of those is true. You never know which one it is.

1160
05:19:02,709 --> 05:19:06,790
Hey, tell me. Tell me two truths and a lie. Give me. Tell me two truths and a lie.

1161
05:19:06,790 --> 05:19:13,060
Tell me three truths. No, tell me. No, I don't have two cards. Tell me three lies

1162
05:19:13,619 --> 05:19:19,240
and the truth. Or tell me four lies and none of them are true. Damn, would you guys like to find

1163
05:19:19,240 --> 05:19:29,540
out? Three truths. You got a huge garage with like four cars. None of that. That could all

1164
05:19:29,540 --> 05:19:35,049
be bullshit and you would never know. I just want to know the truth. Maybe one day I'll

1165
05:19:35,049 --> 05:19:45,060
reveal it. I'll do a car reveal one day. But we're at the end here. No, we're not. That's a

1166
05:19:45,060 --> 05:19:54,439
lie. Five truths and a lie. Five lies. Thank you, official crown on the head for the 250.

1167
05:19:55,319 --> 05:20:00,139
If you continue to say that this account is not official, we will add a count of first degree

1168
05:20:00,139 --> 05:20:05,259
slander in addition to copyright infringement. Although if you publicly state how delicious the

1169
05:20:05,259 --> 05:20:11,020
last sandwich was, you ate from one of our fine establishments, we may be able to drop

1170
05:20:11,020 --> 05:20:17,979
that charge. Well, I'll tell you, the last time I ate a sandwich from a restaurant that you may or

1171
05:20:17,979 --> 05:20:22,380
may not be referring to, I cannot confirm or deny what you're asking. It was very good.

1172
05:20:23,880 --> 05:20:44,180
It tasted very, very good. Tell us the sandwich. All right. Okay, fine. Okay, but what? It was

1173
05:20:45,939 --> 05:21:05,340
the Baconator. No, it wasn't. That's not it. It was the Stacker. No, wouldn't you? You would

1174
05:21:05,340 --> 05:21:15,259
like to know what it was, wouldn't you? What kind of sandwich that I drive? You'd really love to

1175
05:21:15,259 --> 05:21:31,290
have that information. Could be a, could be Big Mac. What kind of car he eats. Thank you,

1176
05:21:31,290 --> 05:21:36,009
though. Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer. 250 from Garfield. Buckle yourselves in,

1177
05:21:36,009 --> 05:21:40,409
boys and girls. It's time for the final Garfagraph. Final, wait, final Garfagraph.

1178
05:21:41,049 --> 05:21:51,189
What is this? This can't be real. It's been quite a journey, Germ, with me

1179
05:21:52,409 --> 05:21:59,130
talking about Odie and other cartoon happenings. You getting bricked, fumed as you read every single

1180
05:21:59,130 --> 05:22:06,090
one. Me only paying you 25 cents to read a wall of text. You laughing one out of 10 of them.

1181
05:22:06,090 --> 05:22:14,250
Good times, good memories. I think it's about time Garfield buries this hatchet once and for

1182
05:22:14,250 --> 05:22:18,729
all. Garf will be but a memory to the Germs. Thanks for all the laps, Germ, and never stop

1183
05:22:18,729 --> 05:22:29,220
killing those Mondays. But who will you become? But who will you become? We need to know the,

1184
05:22:29,220 --> 05:22:36,759
the, the, take the, the veil off. We need to know who the, the, the, who's behind the mask.

1185
05:22:38,520 --> 05:22:42,840
Garfield. 250 from Garfield. Here we go. Let's see who the, who's behind the mask.

1186
05:22:43,479 --> 05:22:48,900
Thank you for the $2.50. Again. Hold on. I'm not back. I just dropped my pen on the floor.

1187
05:22:49,990 --> 05:22:56,009
Ha, you know us cats. No pockets and all that. Okay, this is the final Garfagraph. At least

1188
05:22:56,009 --> 05:23:02,119
giving constant Garfagraphs. I might like pop in every year or so. I don't know. Don't stop

1189
05:23:02,119 --> 05:23:07,779
believing all you Germs in chat. I might even come back one day. Who knows? Does any other

1190
05:23:07,779 --> 05:23:13,400
cartoon Germabit donators make yourself known? Remember that Robot Jones guy? He gave like two

1191
05:23:13,400 --> 05:23:22,229
bits that one time. Don't forget to update the Germo Wiki. Constant Garfagraphs. Constant

1192
05:23:22,229 --> 05:23:30,740
conflict. Well, if this is for real, Garfield, you've been a, you've been a hell of a

1193
05:23:30,740 --> 05:23:37,700
contributor to the community. If you're retiring the name, hopefully, hopefully you're not

1194
05:23:38,740 --> 05:23:47,369
leaving the community. But if you, if you have some things going on that make it so you can't

1195
05:23:47,369 --> 05:23:52,380
participate as often in streams, then whatever it is, I wish you the best of luck. Thank you

1196
05:23:52,380 --> 05:24:10,250
so much for your awesome, awesome contributions. Hell yeah, Garfield. Thank you. Hope you're

1197
05:24:10,250 --> 05:24:19,369
still here under another username. Yeah. Definitely. And that's my time. Have a good

1198
05:24:19,369 --> 05:24:28,729
week everybody. I will update the SUS early. Probably. I don't know exactly when I will be

1199
05:24:28,729 --> 05:24:38,810
back in this chair. It's going to be at least a week. Six days probably. One, two, three,

1200
05:24:38,810 --> 05:24:43,450
four. Maybe less than that. It depends. Keep an eye on the SUS. You will see. You'll know.

1201
05:24:44,659 --> 05:24:58,459
Thank you for participating in the movies streams. Have Kim stream. Kim is coming with me.

1202
05:24:59,099 --> 05:25:07,770
We are both going back. Talix is going to hold the fort down here. He's going to take

1203
05:25:07,770 --> 05:25:20,340
care of Otto for us while we go back. But yeah, I'll see you soon. Don't forget about me,

1204
05:25:20,340 --> 05:25:28,900
because I won't forget about you. Good night, guys. See you real soon. Have a great week.

1205
05:25:28,900 --> 05:25:32,500
Tata.
