1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,080
Oh, he's early. He loves us. Just saw that.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,779
Oh, then you- you're right. That's a true statement.

3
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,279
Aye.

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,940
I have tears in my eyes. I'm crying right now.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,800
Vod watchers skip 25 minutes.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,879
Uh, don't. Don't do that.

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,239
There's no reason for you to do that today.

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,039
We're not stalling today.

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:44,439
There's no chubby bunny today.

10
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,939
Enable peepoween right now.

11
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:47,939
No.

12
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:56,390
Vod watchers, don't skip. He's about to do a cinnamon challenge.

13
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,340
What, you mean the videos where I take a gigantic spoon

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,340
and just place the gigantic spoon of cinnamon in my mouth

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,340
and instantly just spit it all out all over my kitchen?

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,030
And I, like, foam all around my mouth while I scream?

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,260
No. That's not worth it. I don't want to clean my kitchen.

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,760
Dude, you guys don't know is when that video turns off,

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,640
that person has to spend the next probably three hours

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
getting every grain of cinnamon off their fucking kitchen counter.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,640
And off the floor. And then they have to wash the floor.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,299
And then they upload the video.

23
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,299
And if the video doesn't get enough revenue

24
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:44,599
for that to have been worth them destroying their kitchen,

25
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,099
they gotta up the game. They gotta up the ante again tomorrow.

26
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:56,180
Yo, first stream caught on time? What's your name?

27
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,180
Hey, Fanto. Thanks for the sub.

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,430
Oh, they're not subbed. Hey, thanks for watching.

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,930
Thanks for the watch.

30
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,430
Hey, thanks for the watch. I can't believe you gave me a Rolex.

31
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,639
This guy's crazy.

32
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,770
Yeah, we're gonna play Saw 2. It's been long enough.

33
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,159
I'm playing Saw 2 in the first week of Halloween.

34
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,460
Well, the only week of Halloween.

35
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,460
We're starting the week of Halloween with Saw 2

36
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,460
because I just want to get it out of the way

37
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,460
so then I don't have to look over at the chat

38
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,639
and see the next four straight days, three straight days.

39
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,020
Hey, we're Saw. We're Saw, dude.

40
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
You're supposed to be playing Saw right now.

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
How come he's not playing Saw? When is Saw?

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,889
We're doing it first.

43
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:44,889
Three days of Saw in a row. No.

44
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,639
I would be, I'll tell you right now, I would be shocked,

45
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,889
electrocuted even, if we play this tomorrow.

46
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:57,139
I have to make a prediction.

47
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,139
I feel like this is an electrocution string.

48
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:06,650
I'd be shocked if this turns on tomorrow, this game.

49
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,650
I would put the screen over to the game,

50
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,150
but I'm not gonna do that yet because it's flashing red

51
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,580
and it's horrible to look at.

52
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,080
I don't want to, just, it's terrible.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,580
It's awful to look at, so I don't want to make you suffer.

54
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:29,919
Enable face cam. No, Saw 2? Why do you need that?

55
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,479
There's no scary moment in this.

56
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,979
Hey, thank you, Clore, the terrifier.

57
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:40,639
Five community subs, thank you.

58
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,139
Do it, do it. No, no, no.

59
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,870
Why are you playing the sequel, you fucking Looney Tune?

60
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,879
You know how much this was demanded of me

61
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,879
for the last three or four months?

62
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:07,860
Veto. I'm not gonna veto this.

63
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,870
Do you know how hard this game is to find?

64
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,920
This is a rare ass game.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,920
I think as of right now, only one of these is for sale.

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,230
As of this moment right now,

67
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,040
there is one copy of Saw 2 for sale on the internet.

68
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Just saying, pretty rare.

69
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:39,279
Look, I'm gonna warn you, this actually is horrible to look at.

70
00:04:39,279 --> 00:05:00,800
Here it comes.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,990
That's what's gonna happen.

72
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,990
I guarantee you this whole game is full

73
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:16,970
of glorified crossword puzzles for choice.

74
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,839
I can't look, yeah, it sucks to look at.

75
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,899
All right, you guys ready?

76
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:28,949
Ready to do this?

77
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,220
We're in the helmet.

78
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,220
By the way, how is it possible that Saw 2

79
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,660
looks worse than Saw 1?

80
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,160
Is that weird?

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:50,120
I'm not playing on insane mode, that's dumb.

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Why would I ever pick insane mode for Saw 2?

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,449
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

84
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,949
Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh.

85
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:05,939
Okay, Michael, it's me, Saw.

86
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:06,939
Okay, I'm gonna stop.

87
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:15,319
I can't abuse that today.

88
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,319
Wait, what?

89
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,029
Is that a mirror?

90
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:21,990
What was he looking at?

91
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,490
Why was that just a VR cam, like a third-person VR cam?

92
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,360
Oh, here it comes, shh.

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:54,160
Are we all drug addicts?

94
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,660
Your impression is better.

95
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,660
This is actually the guy that is Jigsaw.

96
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,730
Oh, I hate eyeball stuff.

97
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,970
X, X, X, tap X?

98
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,100
Tap X to stab yourself in eye?

99
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,610
Wait, I missed?

100
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,110
Wait, why?

101
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,860
He didn't even tell me what to do.

102
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,860
Oh, Campbell, Campbell, slow down, slow down, slow down.

103
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,860
Don't do that, don't do that.

104
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,490
What did I try to...

105
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,490
What did you do, Campbell?

106
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,490
Inside your eye, there's a key.

107
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,490
Oh, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell,

108
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,490
I see your stomach.

109
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,490
Oh, Campbell.

110
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,720
Oh, this is fucking disgusting.

111
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,500
Campbell, Campbell, that was just from the spirit of,

112
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,000
that was just from the spirit of Halloween.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Here's a shot, Campbell,

114
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
I swear to god, the key is in your nose.

115
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,300
Saw, please.

116
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,449
Oh, I did it.

117
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:05,500
That sucked.

118
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,839
Wait, do you get to play as Saw this time?

119
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:21,250
Imagine you get to play a song make traps. That would be so much better. I gotta turn the audio up for me

120
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,589
It's so low. It's so low

121
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,399

135
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:17,019
I saw the review. Oh, I get it. Okay, let's get a match

136
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:29,669
I saw I've read the review of saw to like the one of the reviewers was like it was really like interesting

137
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,710
It was kind of a fun game until the interactive eat the guy sequence. It was just sickening

138
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:48,879
So I mean we're gonna get there eventually I think oh, I got didn't know that was on him. I guessed that

139
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:57,210
You know have a flashlight that can be used to illuminate dark areas. Okay, cool. I actually did I didn't know that was on his chest

140
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:07,139
Alright, so I illuminate dark areas escape from jigsaws workshop. Hey, just as long as there's no shotgun traps

141
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,450
I could care less saw blade

142
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,529
Why can't I see that? I touch items and I can see what their use is

143
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:28,059
Don't get it pendulum blade. You're a psychic

144
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:36,039
Is that really what this is combination lock wonderful. I can't wait to do this a thousand times

145
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:47,509
We're gonna do one two, three four or five. All right that combination impale and impaler. That's the name

146
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:52,490
That's a car. This is for the first game that we did that to the first guy

147
00:11:52,490 --> 00:12:04,320
I look for you got you say code over code Chevy Impaler. You can see but do you understand?

148
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,950
Campbell

149
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:14,149
Oh

150
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:48,679
Five-seven-three, I got the hey I get by brute force the first part for the last part. It's what?

151
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,700
Okay

152
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,220
What that wouldn't kill you? I don't think that would kill you

153
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,940
I'm pretty sure you could fucking not be hurt by that

154
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:15,100
You would probably stub your toe or bend your knee the wrong way. Wouldn't you just twist your ankle?

155
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Oh, there was spikes down there

156
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:26,970
Imagine setting that up. Okay, if you're setting that up you can fucking fall down there and die yourself

157
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:36,470
Can't you if it's that easy? That'd be so horrible. Imagine putting the planks up here. Okay, just be careful

158
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,470
Don't fall flat in

159
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
Okay, so tap X

160
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:50,570
I

161
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,570
Still don't think that would hurt you that much

162
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:55,740
You'd get a little messed up

163
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,059
I think but I you would get maybe cut like your stomach might get cut

164
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,899
But why would you land flat on your face?

165
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,759
You would land kind of on your feet a little bit and go down to a knee you might scrape a knee or two

166
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,509
Okay, explore for an exit. I

167
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:18,919
Check all right with r2 l2 smash. How do I just swing it on my own?

168
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,409
I don't get to use it. Oh

169
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:52,600
What happened to that guy? Oh, he got killed by one of these like a hydraulic murder traps

170
00:14:53,139 --> 00:15:01,470
He was she was just trying to get back in to watch turbo 985 stream. He just took a piss

171
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:05,370
Thank you. I'll take the plus twos. Thank you. Thank you

172
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:19,039
Alright, so what now what I get in here. Oh this way

173
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:27,559
Broken fence. What the fuck is that l2 r2?

174
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:37,730
You have to crawl around first person. Oh, that was so much more amazing if the rat came sort of biting my face in first person

175
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,470
Let me get me on a team. You know, I mean get me on the team

176
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,629
I would I would put that in I'd make sure it was in if I was like the creative director of the game

177
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:49,809
That sequence would go by and I'd be like no no, no, no, no that rat comes and starts biting your face

178
00:15:50,090 --> 00:16:09,279
How did you fuck that up? Okay. Wait. Oh, there's pig face. Where are we by the way?

179
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:21,009
We're like outside inside outside underground above ground inside. I don't get it. Where are we? What building is this? You're in my house

180
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:27,750
Oh cool. That's so cool without a record of your game. Nobody will know your fate

181
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,509
Save your game by approaching the old tape recorder and pressing X

182
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:36,620
So what every time I get to one of these I describe the last thing that happened

183
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:45,500
Okay, why not just carry it around

184
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,220
podcast saw

185
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,809
That's so dumb. All right, I got a nail in a hypodermic

186
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:01,179
I'm just gonna call it a needle cuz I don't like the word hypodermic is hard to say

187
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,529
Hypodermic it feels like we're that there's too many things in the word

188
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:15,460
All right, pick the lock to the door. Sure. I answer the phone. You found one of the 25 I can answer the phone

189
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:28,480
Where's phone? Okay. What the fuck is going on? What?

190
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,119
That's hit my face. Oh, did I did it crush my eye?

191
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:41,349
You have to actually

192
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,430
Like Millennium Falcon this thing

193
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:50,400
That's so stupid. I'm gonna hate that after an hour you leave him alone

194
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,400
His his story repeats itself his history

195
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:15,519
Repeats itself. Hey his story in history. I mean what does the game's about the last guy? I press square instead

196
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:32,079
Yeah, it does it sure does repeat itself they replaced us shotguns with

197
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,599
Stomach knives. That's great. Okay, cool. Let's go

198
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:54,390
Where's the phone? I fucking hate this already. I don't want to do this one

199
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,549
I don't want this is worse than the the this is gonna you understand that eventually

200
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,190
This is just the fun little tutorial. It's gonna be locks that are four miles long

201
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:09,529
The door is gonna be 40 feet wide and like 25 feet long

202
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:24,230
It's gonna be pain in the ass and you know, it it's gonna be a huge thick ass door later on for sex

203
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:28,259
What no there was a

204
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:45,329
Alright so saw to they've added you do two quick time events to stop the thing from killing you when you open the door

205
00:19:45,329 --> 00:20:00,079
Okay, and who cares about the puzzle piece? This is dogshit stuff when I'm gonna watch do it again. Here we go

206
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:08,319
I don't want to do it. I just want to open the door

207
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:23,549
You may be wondering if it gets worse and they put those everywhere. Yes to both. Okay, great. Yeah, I can't wait to play it

208
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:31,819
X triangle it's square. Okay. I was gonna say there's no way that fucking kills me. Why would they kill me?

209
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:51,069
All right, squeeze wait. Hold on. There's a room with the timer. Wait, are we missing it? Where the window go?

210
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:54,829
Oh, he closed the windows on me. This is the flashlight is terrible

211
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,559
Why does flashlight only go one foot in front of my face?

212
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:15,190
So wouldn't I be able to see it on that wall, this is the worst flashlight I've ever seen earthquake wait

213
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:22,880
No, somebody. Hey, don't step on that. It's rigged. You're gonna fall down here. You're gonna sprain your ankle like I did

214
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:40,019
I tried to tell you and I was crushed under all that rubble run for your life

215
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:48,079
To alter your movement speed hold down our one running can save your life, but will make some events more difficult to survive

216
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:53,319
Well, I don't really need to have run for my life. Now. Do I?

217
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:11,869
Nothing chasing me at a laugh. Oh, why is it cuz it's just watch your step. Do I have to run through this door?

218
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:17,269
I have to run through and just put my elbows and wrists up and just smash through with my shoulders

219
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:48,940
Stacking the TVs like that. It's probably really hard to do that if feet the rammer

220
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:59,309
Okay, uh, you definitely have to ram this door, right?

221
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,119
What?

222
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,440
You're not

223
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,720
You didn't even hit me with your head. What is it? What about it? What does it want me to have him ram?

224
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:33,750
Right here. I've already seen this scene in Monty Python. I know how it ends. Oh, come on that I punch him

225
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:41,500
Oh over the elevator have him run

226
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:51,829
He saw me open that he doesn't have his eyes covered

227
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,609
Let me get this straight you die

228
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:19,029
Before you take a step into the fall that my front foot got in there and I died before I

229
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:27,539
Went in I don't have to do that again. Do I thank God? No, I do fuck. Okay. Well, I know to do

230
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:42,519
We'll get it immediately

240
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,079
Is this game as stupid as the last one? We're just yeah, it is it is as stupid as the last one

241
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:51,319
I have to pick out just you have to just touch every stupid filing cabinet and pick out all the old couple

242
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,759
Scissors, that's a weird room. All right, what's this?

243
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:07,599
Imagine that was just him. He's really really way smaller. That's his chair

244
00:26:49,130 --> 00:27:16,700
Okay, you monster activate the circuit panel

245
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,529
Put it in here. It's the same one. This is the same game. This game sucks. I'm about to delete the game

246
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:46,220
Oh my god, it's even more stupid than the last one. It's you have to do opposites. Is that what this is?

247
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,559
Yeah, it's like positive and negative

248
00:27:50,039 --> 00:28:20,339
Isn't it? How can I move this? I already hate this with a passion. Okay, so this is needs to be oh my god

249
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,980
How did you make this worse than the last game?

250
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:44,019
They took the puzzle thing from the last game and they said hey make it make it way fucking worse and even less fun

251
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:52,849
What am I even supposed to be connecting here just all of them just red to yellow

252
00:28:52,849 --> 00:29:14,480
Yeah, but this is not even connected anything and the worst part is I can't switch them because it just bounces you back

253
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:36,720
This sucks. I just want to connect it. All right, so this has to be gone. Which way does this face up?

254
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:59,990
It doesn't go this way. They're magnets. I was I don't I don't how the fuck am I supposed to turn this though?

255
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:16,240
Nice lightsaber sound please for the love of God

256
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:39,609
Why let me turn it so I can connect this shit. I can't imagine making these

257
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,009
Steakums brain this sucks. This is stupid

258
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:49,329
Why did they make it even worse?

259
00:30:49,849 --> 00:31:12,910
Why can I not just spin this around to connect to this? Oh my fucking god

260
00:31:13,089 --> 00:32:17,960
Why why can't I just spin this I never I will never understand. All right, call me call me a psycho

261
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,400
All right

262
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,720
Call me like you're bad at video games

263
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,039
I don't care if you put like connect the fucking wire puzzles like a hundred of them in your like

264
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,839
survival horror action game

265
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:37,740
You've you've made a mistake. You've made a mistake a big one a huge one put on some pounds

266
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,460
I did I put 22 pounds on since like March

267
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:57,920
I met the jigsaw killer and I let him escape his price was too high and I was too weak

268
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:05,369
Jigsaw was holding Gordon's family hostage at gunpoint shots were fired and I ran over to respond

269
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:08,410
If I hadn't been in the next building, I don't know what would have happened

270
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,769
We would had a shootout in Gordon's apartment then jigsaw escaped and I gave chase

271
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,079
Jigsaw was a short man with brown hair large blue eyes

272
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:24,400
I gave a render to the office that found me after I was released from the hellhole Whitehurst

273
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,980
Jigsaw trapped me there. He did horrible things to me in the end

274
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:36,660
He made me choose give up chasing him so that the others may live or continue pursuit and watch them die

275
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:51,339
I gave up the chase. Mr. Freeman. I don't know if I made the right choice found a case file. Well, let me get in there

276
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:08,239
Escape jigsaws game. What is it gonna be like Picross this time there?

277
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:17,599
This is a magic trick. This is magic. Oh, those are both actors. They there's gonna be like electricity. They're gonna scream

278
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,989
It's gonna open they're gonna be gone right now. They're just setting up a thing. Those guys are getting up. They're getting untied

279
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:37,030
I've seen this I've seen this David Spade act before oh

280
00:34:42,820 --> 00:35:04,389
God this game fucking sucks

281
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:23,780
Don't say that. Come on. Don't say that. What choice is that? What do you mean? Okay. Well, let's go first major decision of the game

282
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:43,570
It's a stupid balance

283
00:35:44,389 --> 00:36:10,050
Okay above me. I can't

284
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:20,519
But that is I can't I don't I'm just gonna win. I'm playing the video game soft

285
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,179
Therefore I'm never gonna sacrifice myself. Otherwise, I have to go back to the loading screen. Sorry, dude. I win

286
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:47,130
I'm always gonna pick me guys. I don't think that would have played out a different way

287
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:55,309
I would have gone back to the checkpoint. You'd be surprised what tools can save a life

288
00:36:55,929 --> 00:37:00,400
Sure, thanks for the Warcraft

289
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:07,800
2004 esque tooltips right clicking will open up your stacks in your inventory

290
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:14,599
They still have that shit down there lizard. It's been like 15 fucking years

291
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:24,300
I think people know how to tab target by now take them off. Oh, I'm looking at a window stop with the wild references

292
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:33,510
Look, it is first. Why what's going on here? You're never gonna not get wild references

293
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:38,329
It took up like five years of my entire life. I have to investigate

294
00:37:48,949 --> 00:38:10,550
This guy's not doing anything. This guy's just shining a flashlight. Ooh, wait the question. Oh, well

295
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:16,300
It must be the Riddler. Well, hold on a second Batman. We're not sure about that yet

296
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,719
Textbook Riddler Gordon

297
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,210
Commissioner Gordon I could ask you to leave the crime scene. I'll take it from here. Where's to face?

298
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:35,039
We have no idea where to face this mission to Gordon Freeman

299
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,199
The volumes too low I got you anything solved

300
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,190
Yeah, thanks

301
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,579
What is that? So who's doing that?

302
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:25,719
Who is turning the TV on and off from like 1991? Oh, it's you look user detective vision

303
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:32,039
I'm gonna fucking throw up if I stay like this

304
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:44,800
See you later. Commissioner Gordon. See you later Batman and by Batman by the way, I'll take the binoculars down

305
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:51,530
There's no reason to hold them up constantly. It's gonna make you sick. All right, right. Sorry. Let me go back to regular FOV

306
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,719
Yes, it's me I

307
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:27,260
Would have loved it if it was just Batman, you know what I mean? If it was just Batman standing there silhouette from that far away

308
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:53,130
Tanktop, I don't know what's going on

309
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:58,099
What how did you even get in here you had to go to the door?

310
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:09,280
Okay, that had to have just been the girl or like my colleague somebody just followed me out and put us like a mask

311
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:31,619
On I have to restart for what rise and shine

312
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:56,679
We get this guy's story be so much funny if he says like dog poop or something

313
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:18,170
We just the tortoise in the hair is the hair goes really really fast than you so we're gonna be the tortoise in this scenario

314
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,480
Why did he just say that?

315
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:32,269
What was the point of saying the tortoise in the hair? I thought there's gonna be way longer

316
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:42,079
Try wait a little bit. Well, suddenly just here like four or five seconds later bang

317
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:55,599
That's why I waited. All right. I made it

318
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:17,909
No, okay, which we get that guy that guy's still alive. There's no prize for second place

319
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,880
Aka

320
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,849
You know what I would do in this situation I'm dead serious

321
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:06,840
I would probably just look at like the camera just be like hey, yo, dude. I'm fucking into this

322
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,679
Let me help you. Let me help you. Let me be like, let me be like your right-hand man

325
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,940
I'm your guy. Just let me in

326
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:42,210
And I go through the door and then when I get there I'm like, hey, what's going on?

327
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:47,170
I'm ready to help you and then my hands go around his neck and I squeeze the life out of him till he fucking turns

328
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:59,510
Purple and then I leave he needs someone to chew up the glass

329
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,400
Hey, by the way, some of you guys might not know this glass don't come broken

330
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:23,190
This is has to be broken for this little bit here. Where's that guy? Okay, how do I leave?

331
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,550
Didn't give me a second chance wasn't just to open the door. Oh

332
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:40,460
Okay. Oh, yes broken glass from glass being broken. No, you you don't order broken glass

333
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,480
You don't go to a glass

334
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:50,320
Blowing whatever company and say hey, I'd like a 5,000 pounds of broken glass

335
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,519
You order of panes of glass and somebody has to smash them on the ground

336
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:57,829
Who was this?

337
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:59,619
AB

338
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:02,539
ABCDEFGA. It's okay. It's the letter. It's the alphabet

339
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:10,510
15 okay, so M is one just somebody screens such a screenshot. I don't care prove you deserve a second chance

340
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:12,989
SON

341
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:15,360
Okay, what's SO SON?

342
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,360
The password is son

343
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
SON

344
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,039
All right. So if the password is s son, then we have to assume

345
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:41,320
ABC so what there's no s here. Is there oh, let me count

346
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,400
All right, and this and L is 26

347
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:51,570
L M N O P M N M N M is 2

348
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:57,849
L M 2 L M N O P Q R S would be 7

349
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:00,980
So it's 7 2

350
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,260
7 2

351
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:17,000
Wait, what's it doing? Oh is 3 and it's 2 right? So it's

352
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:41,210
7 3 2 I deserve a second chance, of course

353
00:47:44,880 --> 00:48:03,280
It's just not even why even have the door Ruby deserve a second chance I did prove it now give me a needle

354
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,969
Uh-huh. Fooled you tricky. Wait

355
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,840
Not this time

356
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:20,230
And almost shot him in the head. I still have a flashlight or did they take that from me?

357
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:38,980
I think they took it from me. Why would you duck? I don't know nice

358
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:51,659
How do I attack with weapon? It's not what I wanted to do. I just wasted a health pack. How do you swing?

359
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:56,260
It's not r1 not r2 not l2

360
00:48:57,659 --> 00:49:01,510
triangle circle a fight

361
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,260
Square it's not square

362
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:22,909
what TV's

363
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:28,250
He's talking I guess you're taking up. Oh you are

364
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,610
You and me. Let's go. How do you attack?

365
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:55,219
This is this is this is turn-based combat. No, it's not what's a swing. It's turn-based combat

366
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,449
No, it can't be it actually can't be

367
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:08,340
It's QTE based combat. The first game

368
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,679
was you could swing the bat and swing the melee and have a gun and

369
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:22,070
Take his life to earn back yours

370
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:30,750
Why would you?

371
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:36,710
Make it a QTE game though. This is we're supposed to revolutionize and

372
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:39,349
evolutionize our sequels

373
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:57,110
Why take combat out of the game it had to have been people that worked on this when the lead guy was like, okay

374
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,630
So here we are. We're gonna take combat out of the game. Oh

375
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,320
That's probably really fucking bad. We're gonna replace it with QTE's. Oh

376
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:14,159
Fuck. Oh fuck. This is bad. This is really bad. All right

377
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:20,940
I need to sir. We have to find a fuse search the random boxes

378
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:28,199
I can't I can't see where a box even is veto. No, I can't veto this

379
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:30,920
I have to at least suffer through this for a couple of hours. I have to I

380
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:39,500
Beat saw one. I can't let saw to beat me that easily. What did I miss?

381
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:45,510
We're gonna give up that easily. You guys are gonna give up that easily

382
00:51:46,210 --> 00:52:02,429
Check the body. Oh god. Damn it. Yeah, we were fighting for his his fuse that he had in his pocket

383
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:17,480
It's vile put it on now. I'm not vetoing where I'm gonna suffer through this for at least another 30 minutes at least

384
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:28,840
Did I pressed it right I did he's gonna torture us no, okay

385
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:32,880
This is really important for you guys to understand. I am NOT torturing you

386
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:40,400
I am torturing me and you are watching me get tortured. I'm not torturing you

387
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:53,250

388
00:52:53,969 --> 00:53:00,039
Am I gonna get uh, am I gonna get minus one attack on my next buff? What is it? What's the card?

389
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:02,039
I fucked it up. Who cares?

390
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:16,909
What's the guy say follow the rules? Is it everyone gets minus one attack 30 seconds. Uh, I

391
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,280
Have to stop it at one of these at four

392
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,820
Fuck am I gonna stop the fourth digit at four?

393
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,300
What?

394
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:36,949
Sorry, dude, you're dead. I have they often be zero

395
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,590
They're all gonna be zero. Hey, it's really hard. I'm sorry

396
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:54,860
If it were you over here, you would have the same problem

397
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:58,420
I feel really bad man, but you can't be mad at me for not doing a puzzle

398
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:11,159
You would have had to do the same shit. You had to deal the same thing. Wait, what's that say? Oh

399
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,190
peak

400
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:18,570
3054

401
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,579
That's so stupid

402
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:29,000
It's so dumb. Just I fucked it up. But whatever 3054. This is

403
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,789
Escape room, you know when you can play those escape rooms. This is what they do

404
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:41,079
This is escape room that you all pay 75 dollars each to do

405
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,800
They set this stuff up for you. So you can make sure you can leave

406
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:59,980
This game was probably 60 bucks when it came out. Oh shit. Okay. Oh that person tried to go in there and he died

407
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:04,679

Didn't go back and delete these ones

419
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:03,170
He tried to do the thing where he calls somebody and leaves a voicemail and deletes like eight of them before he gets the perfect

420
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,289

426
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:23,079
Oh, we're suffering. It's Halloween. And what do you do on Halloween? You well, you don't you don't suffer other people suffer though

427
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,739
You know, like you watch

00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:34,139
Exorcist and like everyone's suffering in that movie. It's kind of what this is. That's what you're doing

429
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:47,909
It's all twice. I suffer. Yeah, just imagine my head just went around in a circle and vomit came out of my mouth

Just have the doors open just have them open. It's so meaningless. Just have the doors open

433
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:40,630
It's just extra time in between opening each door. I already go down here. You can't open this

434
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:59,039
Filler yeah, okay. Hold on. Oh, let's see third times a charm strike three. Who is waiting with a shotgun?

Okay, that's pretty good. That's pretty good

436
01:01:09,929 --> 01:01:21,400
They added that just to do that. You know what? I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that that's what they

437
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:33,349
Did that for? Oh my god, this is so far back. Don't fuck that up again. Oh, wait, I have a chance to save this guy

01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:36,840
But can I go in the room? He's in

439
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:51,059
Can I go in? Oh, come on. I wish I could just go in the room. I can't just go in

Yep, we went over here. We said what the hell happened to that guy. We snuck in here got the thing here

443
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:54,579
What was the T pose? Yeah, that was weird. You just let a guy explode and left

444
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:02,519
Well, that's cuz that was the second time we'd seen it. I don't know that way. All right, we go to this way

445
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:11,510
Here he comes

446
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:29,039
Holy fuck. Are you kidding me? Why did wood come out of his head? Why this guy made out of wood?

447
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:41,889
All right, we're back where we were. Everyone relax. Everybody chill out. I'm not gonna get caught by this again. Oh

01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:53,389
Yeah, okay, there's I need the key

449
01:03:55,250 --> 01:04:01,130
Exanima or this is pre-recorded exam of this. I'm playing scary horror video game right now. All right, let's not fuck this up

450
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:10,750
Here we go. He doesn't do it twice. He does do it twice. Why is the gun still there?

451
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:18,840
Oh, I thought it was somebody holding the gun at the door. I

452
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:31,969
Four three zero. I thought it was like every Tarantino movie, but there's just like

453
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:42,389
What's that somebody at the door? I don't want to even play this one. I don't have enough things to do it

454
01:04:42,989 --> 01:05:03,719
Okay, I can do it. I can't I don't have enough. I don't even have remotely enough to do this. All right. Bye. Wait

455
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:21,400
I didn't think I could pick that one up. I would go big one first. Come on. Come on. What what?

456
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:40,449
What stop going out of the game? I don't think I have enough

457
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:55,880
We said Coggers. I can't do it. I don't have enough. Wait, I can do it

458
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:01,599
This is because this is because Chuck E. Cheese said poggers that time when he went like poggers

459
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:17,670
No poggers. I got it. No. Oh, I got a key. Oh

01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,909
Pretend to be engaged

Gotta pretend to be engaged in the game and say things like ooh and huh and oh got to pretend to be engaged

462
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:42,699
Can't have dead hair. I can't have more than five seconds. Goodbye without a noise coming out of my mouth

463
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:50,360
People will leave they'll leave and they'll find somebody that's funnier and has more voices come out of them. Gotta fucking talk. Okay

464
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:53,949
Where's that? Where's that locked door guys?

466
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:09,389
Balancing board lookout. Whoa, it's tricky. Oh chat. We almost lost it

467
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:12,730
Stop knock it off. What?

468
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:27,500
You know that back wall back there. I feel like I've done Christmas decorations like that before

469
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:32,690
Yes, cuz like fuck it. Get him up. I don't care. Just put him up

470
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:43,039
It doesn't matter who's gonna be mad about it of the case file

471
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,900
Shit, I'm doing that thing again

472
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:50,500
Quick jingle your keys for us

473
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,760
2020 decoration stats

474
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,679
Strats no, that's all decoration

475
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:06,659
You just don't you know, you just duck you decorate the front part of the tree wherever your tree is

476
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:12,739
It's in a corner. Just decorate the part that is visible the 180 degrees. It's visible. Don't do the back

477
01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:21,880
It's just extra time. I was getting them off is a huge pain in the ass. It's razor wire

478
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:29,210
Well, this is not I don't that's not my Christmas decorations, right? I what do I do need a nail? Oh

479
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:42,310
Good thing. I looked in the one dumb place that it was it's not a pain in the ass. It's tradition

480
01:08:42,729 --> 01:08:47,260
Well, no, it's tradition for the first like ten years

481
01:08:47,899 --> 01:08:49,899
Until everybody kind of doesn't care anymore

482
01:08:58,449 --> 01:09:03,170
Once you once you get over the age of like 15 16 17 18. It's more

483
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:06,010
All right, let's decorate the tree. Oh

484
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:13,529
Okay. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. That sounds cool. Oh, can we just do the plastic candy canes this year?

485
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:23,010
that's enough right and by the way it all plastic candy canes that you easily hang and

486
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:34,729
Lights wrap it around or just put it all over them. You know, that's that's enough. Look if you decorate your tree like crazy

487
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:37,689
Um, you know, I'm glad you and your family have that awesome time

488
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:41,329
Well, whoever you and your son even other whoever just you you might just do it for fun

489
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:52,819
Glad you enjoy it. Give me the plastic candy canes and just some red lights and I'm done. Fuck this guy

490
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:58,899
No, I didn't say that it was stupid. I said I did say what did I say was stupid? I may have I didn't know

491
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:20,899
I didn't I never said it was stupid. Look in the nightstand of the window. He's a Grinch. No

492
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:27,739
Sorry. No, I've never broken into a bunch of people's houses and stolen items from their house. I'm not the Grinch

493
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:41,350
You call me. What's the bah humbug guy? Okay, the ballroom Scrooge right call me Scrooge not the Grinch

494
01:10:41,949 --> 01:10:55,859
Scrooge is worse. Is Scrooge worse than the Grinch?

495
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:00,430
Let's break this down

496
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:02,270
Scrooge

497
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:12,619
Ebenezer Scrooge. He was like a billionaire or something and he like owned all of New York or something, right? He was a dick

498
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,720
What did he do? Well, I don't remember the story

499
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:23,189
I remember he was just kind of like an old guy that everybody like thought was a big Ebenezer Scrooge. What secrets are you killed people?

500
01:11:23,189 --> 01:11:25,189
He killed he literally killed children

501
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:29,149
Starved children and killed them

502
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,500
Okay, well

503
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:39,869
Maybe stealing an iPad out of somebody's house is not as bad

504
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:45,670
I let me retract that statement. The Grinch is not worse than Scrooge. Oh wait

505
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:50,810
Didn't the Grinch like kill people too in the original story? Oh in the original story didn't the Grinch?

506
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:53,170
Didn't the Grinch like kill somebody?

507
01:11:53,170 --> 01:12:05,359
No, sort of what he did something crazy. He did something bad. The Grinch ate people. He ate people. Wait a minute

508
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:17,449
Hold on back up here the Grinch ate children. No, he didn't. Why would Dr. Seuss do that?

509
01:12:17,449 --> 01:12:25,960
I have guys both of these stories. I have not seen or read or heard in more than a few decades

510
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:32,199
Yes, there was the Ron Howard Grinch movie, but I only watched that movie with the Jim Carrey noises

511
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:39,010
I didn't pay attention to the story at all 15 years ago when it came up and the original cartoon I watched

512
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:50,050
20 years ago Jim Carrey fanboy. Okay, so that's a bad thing. Oh

513
01:12:54,729 --> 01:12:56,649
Thank god, they're not all like that

514
01:12:56,649 --> 01:13:04,770
100% he sucks

515
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:09,960
Alright, hold on a minute. I need you to go watch the mask just do it just tonight

516
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:13,539

517
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:17,220
He's in a costume and he goes to costume parties and stuff watch the mask tonight

518
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:23,140
Do it and then I want you to come back tomorrow and then tell me that that Jim Carrey is not good

519
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:33,760
I just had you have to do that. Why the TV's in the ground. He's getting kind of he's getting a little

Okay, step on the hearts come on the tape and then step on the camera

526

And then step on the heart and then step on the puzzle piece, it's not gonna be that easy

527
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:35,390
It is gonna be that easy

528
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,470

Yeah, just take a running start and jump over it and roll on your back the first time you get electrocuted

532
01:15:04,729 --> 01:15:08,890
Don't you think you're just going to throw your body over this as hard? That's not that far

533
01:15:09,289 --> 01:15:15,359
That's not that far. Some people can step over this if they really wanted to you can jump over that

534
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:23,180
Vito this at 3 o 5 p.m. No, you're stuck here

Well, what the fuck is this puzzle? You have to start from the same place

543
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,960
Answer was outside of the door. Oh you walked into

544
01:16:50,479 --> 01:17:08,020
That's not stop pretending you're gonna lose viewers. That's how you gain viewers. So don't tell me not to do that

545
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:28,739
TV at the beginning it's on that TV. Is it wait? Hold on God art

01:18:05,949 --> 01:18:17,329
I'm gonna get in trouble for cheating. You just did I wasn't watching I was watching the stream

550
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:32,770
I know for a fact that almost everyone here does not care about that. That means you care about this game. There's no way

551
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:48,579
Wait, are these please tell me this is saw. No, come on. I can't just play his audio tapes

553
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:15,130
Okay, that's cool. I got a lockpick now. It also doesn't help that this game is

554
01:19:17,409 --> 01:19:19,050
ugly and dark

555
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:24,430
It's it's too bright and too dark at the same time

556
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:43,659
It's like it's only bloom effects are the lighting and then it's just pitch black. All right, how do I go to the next one? Oh

562
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:44,569

01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:59,859
10,000 people just watched me not be able to read an analog clock for 30 straight seconds. That sucks

579
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:02,260
You know like I have to live with that now

580
01:24:02,619 --> 01:24:27,600
Remember I told you this is just watching somebody suffer. What happened in my oh, what'd it say?

592
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:52,210

01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:59,470
Begged to me to play this game every day for like three months and now everybody wants me to delete it

594
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:13,899

Here we go. I got the thing to cut the chain with

600
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:00,060
I have no idea what just happened

601
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,199
Okay, we've made a hole in the ground

602
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:17,479
Thank you, sir. I don't want to fall because I have to go down there, but I'll die if I fall from this high

603
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,840
Apparently the humans in this game weigh

604
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:23,180
1,500 pounds

605
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:26,930
Some people do don't they?

606
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:45,069

Okay, this is you know

610
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:18,079
I love when people say this shit because I know for a fact that you do not think that this is real

611
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:25,090
Well that too. There's no way that anybody thinks that was real if you thought that was really you'd be they'd be something wrong

612
01:29:25,409 --> 01:29:38,130
There's no way that anybody thinks this is real. It's just not like it. No, this is absolutely not

613
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:41,250
I'm having a bunch of fun. I'm having a ton of fun

614
01:29:41,529 --> 01:29:58,829
It doesn't get to be the worst stream of 2020 unless I don't have a good time. That's true

615
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:23,449
You can't stop complaining, but it just sometimes it's fun to complain. What do you think? Oh shit. No, no, no, no

616

All right right now. It is currently on your screen right now on

673
01:39:35,739 --> 01:39:46,619
Your screen. I sit right there. I saw it. I saw it. I saw it. I saw it. I saw it

674
01:39:46,619 --> 01:39:49,680
I saw it. I saw it. I saw it. I saw it

675
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:52,640
I saw how did you guys even see that when I was walking around being a dickhead?

676
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:19,359
All right, so we talked to this guy. Okay, so in the first game, you know

677
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,529
We're just like we're just murder which is killing criminals

678
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:35,569
I mean I am gonna put it on his dick. So you guys will blow the row up. Oh

679
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:53,699
Okay, so but now what do we do unlock this door? Why does everything have to be see what?

680
01:41:54,899 --> 01:42:20,550
Her to the lobby. I have no guys. I have no idea where the lobby is from here. You promised us exanima

681
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:22,850
I don't promised exanima

682
01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:30,619
Said I'm gonna look into it at that

683
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:41,069
Is this not the lobby but to keep going back? It's not this door. Oh shit. We can go on

684
01:42:41,069 --> 01:42:58,710
Let me go in here. How does this guy get out of the mall me?

685
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:09,130
Um, I just kind of tricky. I'll be honest with you and I'm not making this up. Did I park here?

686
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:14,880
When did we come in? I took the right and went down towards where the food is

687
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:26,399
But is the store I think I feel like everybody's like that. I will tell you with them at complete total confidence at the last

688
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,529
Ten times I've been to a mall maybe eight or nine times

689
01:43:31,529 --> 01:43:39,229
I walked around going with my horn because I had no idea where the car was probably eight or nine times out of ten

690
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:49,539
No, I feel like way more people that will admit that actually do that. You guys don't do that

691
01:43:49,899 --> 01:43:59,729
Just get a valet at the mall

692
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:05,939
What what mall do you go to that has a valet?

693
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:26,159
Mall valet at Walmart imagine there's a valet at Walmart. That would be so ridiculous

694
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:37,319
Hey, you know holy shit imagine like a

695
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:43,430

737
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:28,859
It's just like I don't want to sit there and press like the light button. I hate this shit

738
01:53:28,859 --> 01:53:34,300
I hate these like to press the button to close the door two doors open. I mean I just close them all just

01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:35,340

01:55:19,479 --> 01:55:31,350
Hate these little like little little tinkering tucker little tinker and blow the guys fucking heads out about a sprinting competition

746
01:55:31,350 --> 01:56:02,180
We just sprint as fast you can I'll beat you every time all of you. It's not timed. I can't wait to hear

747
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:11,380
It's not time so it hits the the two around it which they'll put one up top

748
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,920
Then we go like this

749
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:27,880
Can't see basic patterns. Yeah, I didn't go to math school, okay? I

750
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:35,260
Went to swim wicked fast school. I can do that all right, so then this one

751
01:56:35,779 --> 01:56:43,399
So this is a lot this will turn this one off, and we'll like this one up and turn this one off

752
01:56:43,399 --> 01:56:50,000
So this would be this would be lit up and we do this one now. We need to do left

753
01:56:50,000 --> 01:57:06,920
I'm gonna press. Are you sure it's not timed to press left and right I mean it's not timed all right

754
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:11,029
So then this one if we press this one it'll get rid of this one turn this one on and then we need to turn on

755
01:57:11,529 --> 01:57:23,550
Somebody said no no no no wait wait what and then this and then this and then this no fuck

756
01:57:23,949 --> 01:57:30,050
You guys want to hear something funny I have pretended to do these

757
01:57:30,569 --> 01:57:32,569
Since I was a child

758
01:57:32,569 --> 01:57:37,130
You know when you when you get it presented with one of these things and you do it you just go

Oh, yeah, I guess this one and the guy guess that one and then this one. Oh, I got it

760
01:57:40,529 --> 01:58:02,039
Yeah, I I just I've pretended to know how to do that making it. Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely just faking it

761
01:58:02,039 --> 01:58:07,340
I I get how this works, but I don't care enough to give it the time necessary to do it

762
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:12,020
That's why I never do these puzzles because I'm just like oh, I don't buy press a button and two of them pop up

763
01:58:12,539 --> 01:58:16,140
Jason I don't care fuck this give me it to skip this throw that rip it in half and throw in the trash

764
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:21,479
Or I just press a bunch of buttons and eventually get it and then people go. Oh, he got it. Yeah, I know

765
01:58:30,020 --> 01:59:09,560

787
02:02:45,539 --> 02:02:49,140
Sometimes you accidentally let slip slip out being a human being on the phone

788
02:02:49,579 --> 02:02:55,500

798
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:51,649

Okay, I'm coming

800
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:23,880
Okay holding a crutch. I don't think I trust the guy just walking around with a crutch

801
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:40,859
Like you didn't find a better weapon than that and just a wooden plastic metal crutch

802

How long say to make a hot pocket a minute 30 seconds something like that

811
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:52,199
It's three minutes to make a hot pocket. No, it does not three and a half

812
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:57,770
Does it I thought it took like two? Well see the problem is you're not using the crisping sleeve

813
02:06:58,170 --> 02:07:10,079
You just put it on a plate you just microwave it. No, you're doing it wrong Freemurr rushes hot pocket viewer

814
02:07:10,079 --> 02:07:22,180
No, I'm not. I'm giving him plenty of time. The problem is you're eating a hot pocket. I mean, that's yeah, that's true

815
02:07:22,180 --> 02:07:29,460
I don't really like them that much. You know, I used to eat the

816
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:36,840
Wasn't there a pepperoni meatball one? Yeah, I used to eat the pepperoni meatball and marinara one all the time

822
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:23,800

Yeah, it kind of makes me want a hot pocket. Is that weird?

830
02:09:21,989 --> 02:09:26,520
I don't like hot pockets for one very specific reason

831
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:33,979
Because they're too hot to eat and then by the time that they're not hot to eat they're too cold to enjoy

832
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:56,220
This sucks all around and press the that's the very hot. It's very very hot. Okay, keep clean around this dirty laundry

Stolen bit what I steal that from I stole that from somebody. I mean, it's an easy joke

835
02:10:12,130 --> 02:10:24,619
It's an easy reference to make you stole that from Jim Gaffigan. I know I didn't I did not steal anything from Jim Gaffigan

836
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:30,720
He did he stole so many things from Jim Gaffigan. I didn't steal anything. Oh

Got the key. I'd rather boil water

869
02:15:31,539 --> 02:15:35,510
Instead of like a steam joke

870
02:15:35,630 --> 02:15:38,819

02:17:11,579 --> 02:17:14,819
Hooked my mouse with my leg in it left at the same time

879
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:18,700
And I made a clicking noise

880

02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:37,370
Turn up the gamma. How was that cheating?

887
02:18:37,850 --> 02:18:50,610
All I was making my hot pocket real quick. This is way too dark. I have this something going on here

Key to survival lies within okay. Is it here? Is it here? Is it here for is it too?

899
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:47,629

Okay, five eight four two like that's it, right? Oh shit. Wait five

901
02:21:14,629 --> 02:21:17,639
Same number

Same number same explosion joke, right? That's so stupid. I love it. I love it

903
02:21:33,370 --> 02:21:52,370
Just don't ever click on five again. That's the explosion number. Yeah, what was it? Here we go

904
02:21:53,090 --> 02:21:54,979
So

905
02:21:54,979 --> 02:21:57,280
Key to survival lies within

906
02:21:57,959 --> 02:22:00,420
within me

907
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:02,610
within you

908
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:06,260
Is it is it?

909
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:08,180
nine

910
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:11,510
Is it here number four?

911
02:22:11,909 --> 02:22:32,639
Imagine not having infinite lives. That's just where the character dies in the story

912
02:22:32,959 --> 02:22:42,729
What's the actual percentage chance of somebody actually getting through jigsaws bullshit?

913
02:22:43,049 --> 02:22:47,639
This is probably the five millionth person

914
02:22:47,639 --> 02:22:55,239
He's had to try do this and how much of pain in the ass it probably was for the last guy when he set up

915
02:22:55,760 --> 02:23:02,250
Four miles in eight warehouses worth of traps and the guy died at five in the first room

916
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:06,950
You get to write all that other shit off on your taxes

917
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:35,459
Okay, is it the shotgun shells on my back? Is that what it is? It's one two three four five six seven eight

918
02:23:35,459 --> 02:23:37,860
That's nine. There is no nine. Okay, there's a nine right here

919
02:23:38,459 --> 02:24:08,340
Just the amount of people that died to this one. Okay lies within

920
02:24:08,979 --> 02:24:10,979
It's not the shotgun shells

921
02:24:11,059 --> 02:24:18,569
It's not five. I hope look I opened one box the first time and it didn't blow up. What box was that?

922
02:24:19,090 --> 02:24:35,200
Think of this one. Okay

923
02:24:35,719 --> 02:24:37,719
Which number was it? What did I open first?

924
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:46,399
It's not just in order, right? It's not one two, three, four five. It's not right

925
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:55,530
the wires, oh

926
02:24:55,850 --> 02:25:00,489
Shit, you're right. Okay, that one goes to nine and then goes over here to

927
02:25:01,450 --> 02:25:06,059
Here, right? This is this is one

928
02:25:20,399 --> 02:25:26,399
Open the ones that yeah, but I figured it was like that's how you deactivate them to open the one where the cord was going in

929
02:25:26,840 --> 02:25:30,340
Nice Elmo laugh. Oh

930
02:25:31,219 --> 02:25:34,799
For some reason it was like, oh, that's like deactivate them. I don't know

931
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:42,559
But why would that deactivate them? We just it would activate them. So just don't open the ones that are not connected to the wires

932
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:49,239
There's nothing to do with how many shells I have in my back or something in me within you

933
02:25:49,239 --> 02:25:51,719
No, that that don't even who cares about the writing on the wall

934
02:25:52,479 --> 02:26:01,940
Okay, do not open five

935
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:06,270
Do not open

936
02:26:06,270 --> 02:26:13,840
Eight's okay eight is safe eight is safe. There's no cord going in there

937
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:19,280
That one right there is wrapping around it. It's not going in there. There's no cord going into eight

938
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:22,500
Impossible, there's no cord going to eight or seven

939
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:31,729
Cuz that's going all the way over here. See it's still going it's still going that one goes all the way over

940
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:38,620
Okay, no, what cord is going into eight that one is okay. Excuse me. No cord going into seven

941
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:42,479
Thank you. Oh, I've won

942
02:26:42,959 --> 02:27:01,680
That's it. That's it. Is an eight out of ten link here that took so long

943
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:12,379
Yeah, I did but what do you want to do? What is it? What is this? I'm gonna press this button

944
02:27:13,059 --> 02:27:32,040
And I'm going to press this button. Well, that's unfair because I just was able to see in the last five minutes

945
02:27:32,559 --> 02:27:54,280
Bring the elevator down on dude. What's the point? All right elevator?

946
02:27:54,959 --> 02:27:57,909
Get it on the X

947
02:27:57,909 --> 02:28:15,870
Get that pump. I'm here. I thought that was the girl

948
02:28:16,209 --> 02:28:19,549
uh

949
02:28:19,549 --> 02:28:23,010
What Iron Man character was that because there's no way the human could do that

950
02:28:23,590 --> 02:28:26,280
That dude went through five different

951
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:29,760
Stories through the ground

952
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,760
Okay. All right. I'm gonna go in here

953
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:39,959
move

954
02:28:39,959 --> 02:28:47,649
Please take my groceries up to the seventh floor apartment before time runs out

955
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:57,440
So funny

956
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:07,940
It was smooth that was showing off. Oh my god. Why is all the broken glass here?

957
02:29:08,459 --> 02:29:22,489
What is this?

958
02:29:22,489 --> 02:29:43,540
No, I have to build something. What does he want me to do? What the fuck is going on? Oh, oh

959
02:29:44,059 --> 02:30:11,049
It's changing. All right. What uh, what's TV that tells me what happens? Oh, no, this doesn't okay. This one doesn't blow up though

960
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:19,000
Right. There's no gun in anybody's mouth. Just had it. I just had it. I just had it

961
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:35,709
What does that do? No, no, no, no, no change change

962
02:30:36,270 --> 02:30:56,000
Jump over it. What the fuck? I you just reach over it. It already triggered. That's gonna hurt me, isn't it? No, it's not

963
02:30:56,520 --> 02:31:04,250
No, wait, how do I reset? Can I reset this? Just go go. Oh

964
02:31:04,930 --> 02:31:08,459
What? Oh

965
02:31:08,459 --> 02:31:21,670
That one was easy

966
02:31:21,670 --> 02:31:41,620
Reset Randy reset Randy. I'm down. Okay. Now we have to push this somewhere

967
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:47,200
straight through okay

968
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:57,569
Wait, let me get some of these

969
02:32:04,579 --> 02:32:11,750
For the next door. I have to open it. Would you guys be able to stand this dream if that's how I talked the whole time?

970
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:29,809
Maybe a little I don't know if that's supposed to be scary, but that's that guy was not scary

971
02:32:30,329 --> 02:32:34,620
Just walking over here

972
02:32:45,870 --> 02:32:52,120
Okay, where's the TV that explains this? We got snake hand

973
02:32:53,989 --> 02:32:56,430
snake hand knife skull

974
02:32:57,069 --> 02:32:59,069
but it's actually hand and

975
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:04,530
knife and

976
02:33:04,809 --> 02:33:12,870
Knife ah and and knife skull snake and

977
02:33:14,899 --> 02:33:16,799
knife

978
02:33:16,799 --> 02:33:20,079
skull snake knife skull

979
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:22,610
snake

980
02:33:22,610 --> 02:33:41,450
Hey, cool. It's in the box a nail. Well, that was great

981
02:33:41,809 --> 02:34:04,280
He's done it good again. Oh down all the drag marks. What's the dead space thing on your back?

982
02:34:04,639 --> 02:34:12,540
Those are oxygen tablets and that how it works in dead space. That's your oxygen level Oh

983
02:34:20,510 --> 02:34:27,290
Two tabs. All right, we got to follow the track that guy ran away wherever you went

984
02:34:27,290 --> 02:34:36,479
Oh, okay. So this has to go through I need to push that thing

985
02:34:36,959 --> 02:34:41,879
Where oh I gotta move that

986
02:34:42,319 --> 02:34:54,290
I gotta drag that thing across the whole game. Don't I like any Zelda game?

987
02:34:54,770 --> 02:34:58,020
Um

988
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:06,379
Kind of don't I don't know not really I look I love Zelda. There's a cool franchise, but no

989
02:35:06,799 --> 02:35:08,799
No, not on stream

990
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:21,729
Maybe one day maybe oh eight seven six. Oh

991
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:24,709
eight

992
02:35:24,709 --> 02:35:37,170
Seven six. I don't hate Zelda. Why are you guys saying? I hate Zelda play dead space

993
02:35:37,610 --> 02:35:46,530
You know, I might it's really you might see dead space here this coming in the next week or two

994
02:35:46,530 --> 02:35:49,979
I don't know maybe the one problem I have with dead space

995
02:35:50,459 --> 02:35:53,799
Is I have already I've never played it

996
02:35:53,799 --> 02:35:56,520
I maybe played like a little bit of somebody's playthrough

997
02:35:56,639 --> 02:36:02,440
But I have watched somebody play through pretty much that entire game more than once. No, you know

998
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:18,879
Maybe no not not a streamer. This is years ago

999
02:36:19,579 --> 02:36:24,950
You might see it possible

1000
02:36:25,450 --> 02:36:38,440
He's too scared to play it himself

1001
02:36:38,879 --> 02:36:42,469
It's a pretty scary game. Oh

1002
02:36:47,620 --> 02:36:49,620
VR right. Yeah, so VR

1003
02:36:49,659 --> 02:36:51,659
I'm gonna do VR scary games

1004
02:36:53,989 --> 02:37:03,729
I have two or three horror games that are VR. That'll be for one of the nights coming up this week

1005
02:37:05,030 --> 02:37:07,030
Probably if not tomorrow

1006
02:37:07,549 --> 02:37:28,360
On the next day, that's right scary VR games coming the tomorrow the next day soon

1007
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:32,920
Yeah within the next two days. I was gonna do it today

1008
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:38,209
The reason why I didn't do it today is because I've been very tight

1009
02:37:38,770 --> 02:37:43,260
Recently, I had some body work done

1010
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:51,979
I've been mushed around and moved around a lot with my problem. Yeah

1011
02:37:52,659 --> 02:37:54,659
Yeah, I've been pretty sore over the last

1012
02:37:56,260 --> 02:38:01,040
Six or seven days like at least the last three days. What happened this guy's in the room now

1013
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:03,959
Oh, he ran through. All right, come and get me

1014
02:38:04,780 --> 02:38:16,489
I'm just trying to find a good place to s this

1015
02:38:16,969 --> 02:38:44,229
Hit me you died to ramming Randy. Oh, why'd I lean back so fast? No, I got to checkpoint

1016
02:38:44,709 --> 02:38:59,159
Dying means I die and I turn the game off. I was the X there's an X on a wall somewhere

1017
02:38:59,799 --> 02:39:03,770
He needs to ram into

1018
02:39:03,889 --> 02:39:06,049
I'm gonna I guess it's like not there

1019
02:39:06,649 --> 02:39:08,420
About right here

1020
02:39:08,420 --> 02:39:25,930
Really? I'm in the wall. What the fuck he pivoted so fast

1021
02:39:26,649 --> 02:39:36,120
Get it. He didn't get it

1022
02:39:41,530 --> 02:39:56,440
fucking God

1023
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:07,100
Somebody said me when somebody takes my McDonald's Oh me when somebody steals a fry out of my books. Come on

1024
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:20,879
Stupid. No me when a friend asks for one of my king-size Reese's. There's only four in there man

1025
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:25,840
They should be eight. They should put two on top of each other. It's not a king-size. That's barely anything

1026
02:40:26,639 --> 02:40:35,950
king-size

1027
02:40:35,950 --> 02:40:41,459
Run into the fucking wall

1028
02:40:47,709 --> 02:40:56,739
Come on. No, I don't want to stick my

1029
02:41:10,690 --> 02:41:22,659
Have to do it are you fucking kidding me? I just got dark souls, dude

1030
02:41:23,659 --> 02:41:45,090
What are you a hide knight give me a break, okay, I'm getting I'm getting

1031
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:48,370
real real sick of this

1032
02:41:57,309 --> 02:42:17,170
And him in the head I smash him in the head with this that was not a ram that was a chest bump barely

1033
02:42:17,450 --> 02:42:33,370
He faked you out

1034
02:42:33,690 --> 02:42:45,280
The idea is that he's hitting you with his head, right? That's what we're led to believe here

1035
02:42:45,639 --> 02:42:52,709
A Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC 1 2 3. I mean the 1 2 3 at the end actually made me read that so

1036
02:42:53,010 --> 02:42:54,770
It's pretty good work

1037
02:42:54,770 --> 02:43:01,340
I'm gonna play the tape

1038
02:43:01,340 --> 02:43:11,940
What does the tape say?

1039
02:43:12,620 --> 02:43:16,180
These people are not he's not like savable people

1040
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:24,340
You stabbed children with knives Patrick's you

1041
02:43:25,139 --> 02:43:28,559
You ate children you murdered children. I

1042
02:43:29,479 --> 02:43:34,200
Swear to God didn't they like you did drugs for like a week or something. Like what is all this?

1043
02:43:41,229 --> 02:43:46,959
Break that. Oh, he was the one that was stabbed. So what the hell are you doing jigsaw fuck off?

1044
02:43:48,559 --> 02:44:07,079
He didn't hit the wall, can I just walk through

1045
02:44:10,559 --> 02:44:25,950
What I?

1046
02:44:25,950 --> 02:44:28,350
Can I be honest if I'm doing this right, right?

1047
02:44:28,350 --> 02:44:31,790
I have to try to get him to hit the door a few times the crack a few times

1048
02:44:32,069 --> 02:44:37,559
This is in a situation where like I can't read the analog clock, right?

1049
02:44:37,879 --> 02:44:41,659
You would tell me I would know

1050
02:44:41,899 --> 02:44:58,250
Let's get the abridged version, please. I got one. Oh

1051
02:45:10,639 --> 02:45:17,620
my god

1052
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:29,020
Why can you do that? Why can you do that? That's not fair

1053
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:59,500
You have to make him run into the mattress. No, you he already ran to the mattress like four times. Just do the skip

1054
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:15,829
Hey, how's your Halloween week going so far? Hopefully good damn it. I tried to time it

1055
02:46:15,829 --> 02:46:20,770
I actually did time it pretty well to the end of the cutscene move

1056
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:38,219
Circle the other way at this bitch. I can't move right now. He's still running. I can hear him

1057
02:46:38,500 --> 02:46:50,280
Okay, he hit me and the wall

1058
02:46:50,399 --> 02:47:17,000
Who got it easy? Oh my god

1059
02:47:17,719 --> 02:47:31,979
First scary part of the game was right there. You can't use Wilhelm for every scream

1060
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:51,620
Yep, you can if you don't pay for any others. You got a new link me one sec

1061
02:47:51,620 --> 02:47:54,500
Let me get through the balance beam section sure thing. I'll open that up, dude

1062
02:47:54,979 --> 02:48:21,379
Okay, but why this why is this a big deal and it's too dark and this is so dark

1063
02:48:21,379 --> 02:48:23,180
I'm gonna turn the game up. It's ugly now

1064
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:30,450
Yeah, take a take a selfie of your face in the dark with the flash on

1065
02:48:30,969 --> 02:48:34,559
Look at it, and you tell me what you think

1066
02:48:35,159 --> 02:48:47,340
What how did you click the wrong one? Why are you guys linking a picture of my like bulbous ass? I don't understand

1067
02:48:47,340 --> 02:49:05,489
I mean, it's definitely photoshopped. I'm I got I do have a big ass, but it's

1068
02:49:06,049 --> 02:49:17,639
Absolutely, I think that's photoshopped. I don't think that's real not at first try

1069
02:49:18,159 --> 02:49:34,360
There are no it's probably like do I really need to prove it?

1070
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:38,319
It's probably four or five hundred thousand

1071
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:52,799
Images of a screenshot of me my ass or something. I'm sure it is. Where are they? I don't know

1072
02:49:52,799 --> 02:49:57,930
I don't look up pictures of my own body parts

1073
02:49:57,930 --> 02:50:01,209
Well, do you think I'm gonna tell you I know where these are? I know they exist

1074
02:50:01,649 --> 02:50:09,639
I don't type in Jerma ass Jerma's ass like Jerma's balls. Like I don't type. Why would I type that in?

1075
02:50:09,639 --> 02:50:15,219
I know what they look like. I have them. I have they I own those things. I can look in a mirror

1076
02:50:15,219 --> 02:50:16,760
I don't need to look up my own ass on Google

1077
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:30,840
I know what it looks like and I can look at it naked in the mirror. What's the code code bullshit?

1078
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:40,600
All right, did I miss something? We're see code

1079
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:51,670
Oh

1080
02:50:51,670 --> 02:51:04,500
What's that not air? Oh

1081
02:51:06,809 --> 02:51:14,649
I need a code, please. Oh, yeah, I promise. This is not the first saw game

1082
02:51:14,649 --> 02:51:26,409
Those you guys that are asking wait, ooh, all right. That's weird. It looks very similar. I know oh

1083
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:32,079
There it is. Oh, it is

1084
02:51:33,899 --> 02:51:40,610
zero eight seven saw noose

1085
02:51:42,170 --> 02:52:02,899
Hatchet whatever that means saw but what number does that mean? I think that actually that is supposed to be a number

1086
02:52:02,899 --> 02:52:32,860
That's yeah, that's zero at zero something seven or be three three zero seven zero eight seven

1087
02:52:32,860 --> 02:53:01,270
So yeah, I had it right. Wait, where the fuck is that thing? I had it right didn't I? Oh eight seven

1088
02:53:01,270 --> 02:53:33,620
No, it was eight. Oh seven one. Oh seven eight. Yeah, it's eight. Oh seven then was it a was it a six Oh six seven

1089
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:48,639
But how would the news the news has to be a zero, right? That's not how the puzzle works

1090
02:53:48,639 --> 02:54:01,540
Oh six seven. Well look at four numbers inside the room that was there

1091
02:54:01,620 --> 02:54:14,959
It was symbols on the walls in the room eight six seven. We might be overthinking this

1092
02:54:15,079 --> 02:54:26,899
All right. Wait, there was there was something on the wall where I was look for numbers related to the symbols

1093
02:54:27,239 --> 02:54:29,920
Yes, yeah

1094
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:33,239
Six two one. Oh my god, please. All right that person if that's not right

1095
02:54:33,239 --> 02:54:40,639
I want that person timed up for five minutes. We'll see we'll see you get to stick around

1096
02:54:41,239 --> 02:54:48,030
You're about to get a five minute timeout. You're out. See you later

1097
02:54:49,399 --> 02:54:54,360
815 all right time that person out too for five minutes. I'm not kidding you. Yeah, come on. You hold up the stream. Oh

1098
02:54:56,010 --> 02:55:22,290
That person got VIP that person five minutes. All right. Now we can push this thing modem

1099
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:27,040
11,000 people here. Holy shit. I'm just realizing that now. Hi

1100
02:55:27,719 --> 02:55:29,180
What's up?

1101
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:48,760
Going on. I've been good. I was eight one five, right?

1102
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:51,639
So it had to been something like on the wall that corresponded

1103
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:55,280
With the symbols and that person has a walkthrough up

1104
02:55:55,680 --> 02:56:01,479
Because they're so desperately trying to make sure that I don't stay in the same area for like 40 minutes straight that they hope

1105
02:56:01,479 --> 02:56:14,639
That they're the one guy just putting solutions in the chat and I get it. I actually I appreciate it. What hurt me

1106
02:56:14,959 --> 02:56:24,799
All right going down. Let's get this thing that saved a lady. That's been trapped in that box

1107
02:56:25,440 --> 02:56:34,190
Everything's good. I happen to catch a stream of you playing a game. That was my favorite when I was young

1108
02:56:34,670 --> 02:56:38,260
When you were 10

1109
02:56:38,260 --> 02:56:45,729
Wait, you played saw the video game where people get like they're like heads cut off and like their bodies like maimed when you were 10

1110
02:56:45,729 --> 02:56:51,360
I

1111
02:56:51,360 --> 02:57:01,430
Didn't do that. Do you guys have experience with the M rated kind of R rated stuff before you were like 15 14 13?

1112
02:57:01,430 --> 02:57:03,190
I kind of I didn't

1113
02:57:03,190 --> 02:57:07,059
I was like 12 13 14. I don't think I did

1114
02:57:07,639 --> 02:57:17,440
Maybe like maybe maybe like 14 13 14 15 like I caught an R rated movie

1115
02:57:17,440 --> 02:57:21,000
I was like, oh, I snuck it. I found a way to sneak it

1116
02:57:21,559 --> 02:57:40,139
But I mean after like 15 it didn't matter anymore. I don't think I played Silent Hill when I was seven

1117
02:57:44,329 --> 02:57:46,010
What did you think?

1118
02:57:46,010 --> 02:57:48,959
You know, what did you think?

1119
02:57:50,360 --> 02:57:55,659
The whole thing let's fight you must have been terrified

1120
02:57:56,219 --> 02:58:12,680
Hold on. I guess I'm trying to the pocket turn power off. I feel like sevens a little young for that

1121
02:58:13,319 --> 02:58:16,239
Wow, very I would say very young for that

1122
02:58:16,879 --> 02:58:25,639
That's a being a wimp. I

1123
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:33,280
Don't I I don't think I would want to be seven years old and see like the godfather

1124
02:58:33,319 --> 02:58:38,340
I don't think that what I would probably be like what's happening. Why is people killing each other?

1125
02:58:39,059 --> 02:58:59,780
Where's that guy's exploded? I don't think I'd want to see that my brother watched the exorcist when he was six. I

1126
02:59:03,639 --> 02:59:06,959
Feel like that would just really mess up your little child brain

1127
02:59:07,479 --> 02:59:21,049
For months potentially years. Are you telling me you can't I mean you talk about Barney the dinosaur and the wiggles

1128
02:59:21,809 --> 02:59:23,829
to

1129
02:59:23,829 --> 02:59:27,750
People being like having their heads exploded and eaten and like swears and stuff

1130
02:59:27,750 --> 02:59:31,149
I don't think you'd I wouldn't be able to handle that don't freak me the fuck out

1131
02:59:31,350 --> 02:59:52,840
Is that the guy that I've let out the beginning that the guy that got out free?

1132
02:59:53,360 --> 03:00:04,040
Well, there are consequences here. That guy's still here. Wait, can I open that?

1133
03:00:12,430 --> 03:00:22,739
Whatever don't even care. It's kind of spooky. Oh

1134
03:00:25,690 --> 03:00:38,350
I wonder if they're gonna move positions. Oh, it's just we just have to go stand in the corner. You mentioned Silent Hill

1135
03:00:39,110 --> 03:00:42,500

1137
03:00:45,219 --> 03:01:01,940
Anything else there's just nine three eight. Mm-hmm. Fuck. I thought I messed it up

1138
03:01:02,760 --> 03:01:29,420
Game fucking stinks. Oh, there we go. Choose the next one, please. I really wish that that would kind of come back

1139
03:01:29,940 --> 03:01:35,649
Let's say sucks a lot of this sucks. This sucks. This fucking stinks

1140
03:01:35,969 --> 03:01:39,809
This stinks is better like that. I think that I would want to see that word used more

1141
03:01:40,569 --> 03:01:45,549
Like it's underused

1142
03:01:45,549 --> 03:01:51,120

03:15:54,069 --> 03:15:55,829
What the hell just happened?

1226
03:15:55,829 --> 03:16:13,059
You're fine. Just hold on a minute. There it is

1227
03:16:13,579 --> 03:16:32,840
What just hold on hold your breath the average human can hold their breath for 60 seconds. I got you

1228
03:16:33,299 --> 03:16:47,040
You're good. Why is it? No, I don't I don't understand. Well, I can't press any buttons. You're doing great

1229
03:16:47,719 --> 03:16:54,329
You have to line them up at the same time. I haven't I've done that like three times now. You're doing really good

1230
03:16:54,370 --> 03:16:56,370
Holy shit, we got a Navy SEAL here

1231
03:17:06,920 --> 03:17:10,840
I'm doing this obviously completely wrong. Well, I'm just hold it there. I can't though. I

1232
03:17:18,270 --> 03:17:20,270
Don't I believe what am I supposed to do?

1233
03:17:21,879 --> 03:17:23,879
Sink them I already did that

1234
03:17:24,200 --> 03:17:36,700
It lined up and the thing could go right down the middle. You're still alright

1235
03:17:37,100 --> 03:17:44,579
They all have to be just going this at the same time

1236
03:17:44,579 --> 03:17:52,409
I was I thought it was they all to line up right in the middle so that the water can just go through

1237
03:17:53,010 --> 03:18:11,879
But I didn't I do that already on the second one it would lined up correctly needs to be perfect. Oh, okay

1238
03:18:11,879 --> 03:18:29,909
That's stupid. Nothing's perfect. Here we go. All right

1239
03:18:30,469 --> 03:18:43,809
Nothing's perfect almost a little more

1240
03:18:44,329 --> 03:18:53,870
All right. Nothing's perfect done. I did that last time. I'm mad about that

1241
03:18:53,870 --> 03:18:56,790
I did that last time and it didn't work and I was like, well, this doesn't make any sense

1242
03:18:56,790 --> 03:18:58,790
But if the price of the different, uh

1243
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:32,719
Got it. You got you can hold your breath. We have time when you start holding your breath. Fuck

1244
03:19:35,920 --> 03:19:36,920
No

1245
03:19:36,920 --> 03:19:39,399
No, she's gonna drown

1246
03:19:39,399 --> 03:19:44,020
Just the bottom was not even eyes off to

1247
03:19:45,020 --> 03:19:54,309
We have time we have time. We have time. Come on. That's it. What?

1248
03:20:13,569 --> 03:20:35,000
Fucking dead why

1249
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:37,239
why

1250
03:20:37,239 --> 03:20:49,239
Line them up. So they all go and they all line up at the right point at the same time. She's drowning

1251
03:20:50,079 --> 03:21:21,120
Scary shit, isn't it? What's the game have that's too high? I'm getting it this time. I'm doing it

1252
03:21:21,159 --> 03:21:40,219
I'm swear to God what that doesn't count. I have to let it go. Okay, go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

1253
03:21:40,219 --> 03:22:05,780
Go go go go go go go go go go time time got plenty time now. Wait, we're good. I hold on easy. Okay, hold on. Oh

1254
03:22:15,309 --> 03:22:19,450
Get the fuck out of get the fuck out of get the fuck out of get the fuck out of here

1255
03:22:19,989 --> 03:22:29,010
You know your name

1256
03:22:38,889 --> 03:22:52,079
He was and what you did to him you're a monster these slippers are really comfortable by the way and we're in the whole time

1257
03:22:54,079 --> 03:23:21,559
You broke him I did just save her life. That's true. Oh, yeah, I'm not done. I'm not done with you. I said I'm ah

1258
03:23:22,200 --> 03:23:38,409
Come on. Oh, they trap you in here. She leaves saw two

1259
03:23:38,969 --> 03:23:43,049
So after saw two they didn't make another game

1260
03:23:43,489 --> 03:23:48,610
Five more movies came out but nope, they weren't gonna keep up with this

1261
03:23:49,170 --> 03:23:50,569
No way

1262
03:23:50,569 --> 03:24:16,010
There's seven of these eight of these. I wonder why I don't know weird

1263
03:24:16,010 --> 03:24:22,229
It seems bizarre that they wouldn't make another one means the first ones were

1264
03:24:23,180 --> 03:24:24,899
so good

1265
03:24:24,899 --> 03:24:44,940
Bizarre, I think one to end this on a high note. Fuck. Oh

1266
03:24:45,620 --> 03:24:53,659
No, this TV fell down. He can't berate me back. Ooh

1267
03:25:08,229 --> 03:25:17,079
There it is wait take it out the puzzle in record time

1268
03:25:17,600 --> 03:25:36,969
You know, this game would have actually been really good if you have to make choices and kill somebody and keep somebody else alive

1269
03:25:37,329 --> 03:25:44,620
We could have at least made choices

1270
03:25:44,860 --> 03:25:51,219
Rather than just do another light puzzle to save this guy or he's gonna get squished

1271
03:25:51,700 --> 03:26:04,120
Okay, I need a lever and I need

1272
03:26:04,399 --> 03:26:17,590
Dig so you suck at making stuff. There's a house with a wall with a dad at the bottom of the city

1273
03:26:18,149 --> 03:26:33,659
All right, find the lever find the acid plating area. This open none of these are open lever

1274
03:26:34,299 --> 03:26:47,739
Build my elevator. Well, it's obviously not here. Can't go in there shipping and receiving

1275
03:26:48,500 --> 03:26:55,719
Big so what the fuck do you want me to do here? I watched a door open. Did I

1276
03:26:56,319 --> 03:27:03,379
Sure, I was looking away from the video game. I might have been looking away from the video game at that moment

1277
03:27:03,899 --> 03:27:15,750
Alright, let's go. Oh, did I accidentally just not die from whatever that was circuit? Oh

1278
03:27:29,540 --> 03:27:44,420
It's got to come from up doesn't it sick. Okay. Now we got to get yellow has to be this way

1279
03:27:44,979 --> 03:27:48,020
Has to be this way

1280
03:27:48,020 --> 03:28:14,969
Way, what'd you do that for? What the fuck? What just happened dumb fuck this is wrong. All right, hold on

1281
03:28:14,969 --> 03:28:20,370
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, it has to come from up and down

1282
03:28:20,930 --> 03:28:32,120
So therefore it has to go like this or this has to so we're gonna say

1283
03:28:32,639 --> 03:28:44,809
Kill this and this over here and then that goes like this and this is wrong again. It's wrong again

1284
03:28:46,610 --> 03:29:06,319
Okay, it's wrong again. I okay. I did it. I did it very very very well

1285
03:29:16,700 --> 03:29:31,079
Accidental, all right, find the lever

1286
03:29:31,239 --> 03:29:34,219
I

1287
03:29:34,219 --> 03:29:36,059
Needs in your chat

1288
03:29:36,059 --> 03:29:43,459
Not a joke Kanye's here. What's up? What's going on Kanye? What's up?

1289
03:29:44,059 --> 03:29:50,579
You're gonna tweet out the screen

1290
03:29:50,700 --> 03:29:53,069
Imagine that's easy

1291
03:29:53,350 --> 03:30:00,520
Alright, it's just Kanye holding a picture up that says like a reddit AMA time stamp on it. That says hi Jerma

1292
03:30:00,879 --> 03:30:12,540
All right. I got you. I got you. How do I get it? What's with acid?

1293
03:30:29,690 --> 03:30:31,690
The color was messed up

1294
03:30:31,809 --> 03:30:36,569
I thought it was the other one pink and red. They look kind of similar sometimes

1295
03:30:40,649 --> 03:30:51,000
Melt the chain

1296
03:30:51,000 --> 03:31:04,700
We're good

1297
03:31:04,700 --> 03:31:08,059
It's Amanda again. All right. How many times I'm gonna drop my mouse on the ground

1298
03:31:08,420 --> 03:31:13,979
All right. Don't accidentally turn off like the stream or something. Come on. All right, what's in here?

1299
03:31:14,420 --> 03:31:17,229
All right. There's the valve I need

1300
03:31:17,309 --> 03:31:25,680
Nothing. Okay, that's the valve up here. We've got there's no timer. So this is fine get you when I get you

1301
03:31:26,079 --> 03:31:29,920
Get him I'm getting him

1302
03:31:44,700 --> 03:31:50,639
No danger in this game besides stepping on glass and stuff

1303
03:31:54,549 --> 03:32:06,290
Was that all right, we have a combination lock it's probably one two three

1304
03:32:06,930 --> 03:32:20,790
well, let me scoot closer to you walk pick the DLT box and

1305
03:32:22,120 --> 03:32:38,690
That's it. Just the lock pick. Sure, but I say that I won't know definitely gonna order McDonald's. I'm gonna uber eats McDonald's

1306
03:32:38,969 --> 03:32:41,209
Yep, oh I think so

1307
03:32:41,450 --> 03:33:06,940
What did that do? Yuck. You don't yuck McDonald's here

1308
03:33:07,399 --> 03:33:18,010
Alright, who has the code? I went guy with the walkthrough that's sitting open that's spamming it in the chat right now

1309
03:33:18,010 --> 03:33:30,510
What is it? I four three and I was hoping that the last security guy just forgot to scramble it when he left

1310
03:33:35,059 --> 03:33:56,399
Six nine four. I'm getting flashbacks the last time I did no I'm not doing this again

1311
03:33:56,399 --> 03:34:03,920
I'm actually getting flashbacks the last time I played the first game. So what did that connect? What does that do? Oh,

1312
03:34:11,809 --> 03:34:17,170
I got over I'm going elevator

1313
03:34:17,649 --> 03:34:38,040
Stab I wonder if there are any celebrities that watch my stream. What do you guys think?

1314
03:34:38,479 --> 03:34:48,420
You think I do like Brad Pitt's here. Sometimes he's just a huge fan, but he will never be able to say that out loud

1315
03:34:48,420 --> 03:34:49,879
He will never say that

1316
03:34:49,879 --> 03:34:56,739
Brad Pitt's probably under the covers right now with a right

1317
03:34:57,440 --> 03:35:12,489
iPhone screen in pajamas. Okay. Well, I need a coupler. I'm just spam search every box

1318
03:35:13,129 --> 03:35:28,920
The door about Chuck E cheese

1319
03:35:31,340 --> 03:35:42,149
Chuck E cheese is not a celebrity. He's a toy. He's a big toy. He's not a celebrity

1320
03:35:42,149 --> 03:35:48,719
He's a mascot is a mascot a celebrity. Okay, would you would you say okay, would you say the?

1321
03:35:49,440 --> 03:35:56,280
Like the guy dressed up as the penguin or like the penguin hockey team

1322
03:35:56,280 --> 03:36:05,239
Is that a celebrity the guy in the New England Patriots Elvis costume? Is that a celebrity?

1323
03:36:09,719 --> 03:36:18,840
Darkness illuminates. Well, thanks that no it doesn't why'd you just tell me that?

1324
03:36:35,840 --> 03:36:37,840
apologize to mr. Cheese

1325
03:36:38,520 --> 03:36:41,180
No, he's a great mascot, but he's not okay

1326
03:36:41,180 --> 03:36:51,620
They don't Chuck E cheese does not go to the red carpet during like the Oscars or the Emmys or anything. They don't interview

1327
03:36:52,500 --> 03:37:01,709
Chuck E cheese to ask him what he's wearing. Oh Chuck E cheese come over here. Let's see what you're wearing today

1328
03:37:02,229 --> 03:37:04,440
Well, it's uh

1329
03:37:04,440 --> 03:37:07,000
It's it's a it's a shirt for a toddler

1330
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:14,659
It says see on it for for Chuck E for Charlie and I wear pants biker shorts that ride way up to high and they're a

1331
03:37:14,659 --> 03:37:18,690
Little too tight. I wear this John. I wear this every day. Oh

1332
03:37:20,629 --> 03:37:22,549
You look marvelous

1333
03:37:22,549 --> 03:37:27,040
Really? Hope I get the Emmy

1334
03:37:27,040 --> 03:37:49,670
This doesn't do anything

1335
03:37:49,670 --> 03:38:05,190
Nightwing t-shirt and cargo shorts. What about it? What is it best dressed from what?

1336
03:38:05,190 --> 03:38:07,190
I can tell everyone looks stunning tonight on the red carpet

1337
03:38:14,959 --> 03:38:17,120
Shit oh

1338
03:38:17,120 --> 03:38:18,799
That's not good

1339
03:38:18,840 --> 03:38:25,959
Where where is he he's okay, he's on the red a red carpet

1340
03:38:26,459 --> 03:38:34,340
All right, but hold on a minute. Is this like the Oscars or is this like the Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards?

1341
03:38:34,860 --> 03:38:49,719
This dude's awesome. He just done. Okay. Oh, what a celebrity, huh?

1342
03:38:50,040 --> 03:38:55,459
This dude like I went when like half of your press like doesn't even give a shit that you're on the red carpet

1343
03:38:55,500 --> 03:38:59,239
He's just guessing where that photo is. He doesn't even care

1344
03:38:59,639 --> 03:39:02,780
He's happier to be on the other guy's camera

1345
03:39:02,819 --> 03:39:09,940
You bet your ass this guy's gonna put his face right in and focus the fuck out of that camera when like ariana grande walks

1346
03:39:09,940 --> 03:39:24,899
By not for Chuck E cheese apparently. This is a staged photo

1347
03:39:25,299 --> 03:39:31,670
This is in front of this is in front of a backdrop. This is a backdrop. There's a backdrop. It's not a real carpet

1348
03:39:31,670 --> 03:39:42,040
This is a backdrop. No, it's not real. There's a backdrop here

1349
03:39:42,639 --> 03:39:56,020
Anyways, yeah, I'm okay. Sure. Have you ever been invited to a red carpet thing?

1350
03:39:56,360 --> 03:40:00,770
No, because last time I ate as many hors d'oeuvres as I could

1351
03:40:00,930 --> 03:40:07,850
I was really really hungry. I hadn't eaten all day and there was somebody walking around with like the free shit of food

1352
03:40:07,850 --> 03:40:11,209
There are clams. Oh, wow. I'll take bacon-wrapped scallops

1353
03:40:11,209 --> 03:40:16,600
I just ate a ton of them and then after that I never got invited back to anything else and I know that's why

1354
03:40:16,600 --> 03:40:18,360
I'm certain that's why

1355
03:40:18,360 --> 03:40:25,829
That's a saw that that that's a boomer joke

1356
03:40:26,590 --> 03:40:37,780
Yeah, okay. Sorry. All right, and you can't make can't make any references to anything that I

1357
03:40:38,659 --> 03:40:45,829
I'm old you have to where I'm going you guys have never had a hors d'oeuvres before

1358
03:40:46,389 --> 03:40:56,620
What's the answer? I don't care. I just I know it's like to turn the light on in that room

1359
03:40:56,620 --> 03:41:20,180
But it didn't work. I don't have a coupler. Why can I just have an infinite coupler coupler, please?

1360
03:41:20,620 --> 03:41:29,950
This is the bathroom again. How many guys have been to a wedding? You guys never had hors d'oeuvres before I find that hard to believe

1361
03:41:30,469 --> 03:41:42,370
like by the time you reach the age of

1362
03:41:45,790 --> 03:41:58,489
17 15 you've probably already been to one or two weddings here it is on the image a

03:41:59,180 --> 03:42:03,180
German 520 1026 20 PS. I love saw 2

1364
03:42:03,979 --> 03:42:10,690
He took it at the red carpet. I'm not even put it on stream because I don't even know

1365
03:42:11,209 --> 03:42:19,290
What's the answer? I know somebody has it. Please. Please. Let me continue the stream

1366
03:42:19,290 --> 03:42:21,290
I know somebody has it and don't fuck with me

1367
03:42:27,129 --> 03:42:28,569

1368
03:42:28,569 --> 03:42:32,370
Please please you I don't want to do I don't want to go in that room and look for it. Oh what?

1369
03:42:33,329 --> 03:42:38,360
753

1370
03:42:38,360 --> 03:42:45,659
454 please at least one of you do the work. No, I'm not doing the work

1400
03:48:35,719 --> 03:49:00,139

03:49:40,159 --> 03:49:53,590
The really roundabout way to get whatever this is a puzzle piece. It's not what I wanted

1408
03:49:53,590 --> 03:49:57,989
I wanted a lever or a stake or a wheel or something. Not this shit

Have you ever eaten a corn dog? Yes, I've eaten a corn dog

1454
03:58:28,780 --> 03:58:32,100
Why does that matter by the way? Well, who cares if I've ever had a corn dog?

1455
03:58:32,500 --> 03:58:42,229
Does your opinion of me change if I've if I love corn dogs or something? What about okay?

1456
03:58:42,229 --> 03:58:45,469
What if I have one and I don't like it? It does change. Okay

03:58:46,069 --> 03:58:59,370
Well, you're trash

Trash I way I like corn dogs. I didn't say I didn't like corn dogs

1459
03:59:04,670 --> 03:59:17,420
If human flesh touches it, does it explode? I'm assuming yes

1460
03:59:28,120 --> 03:59:32,969
Okay, that's don't go in here. Don't go in this one. Don't go in that room

04:00:29,790 --> 04:00:54,579

In seven years, I can't go in there yet. What do I do? What do I do?

Go in there keep to the left and go clockwise. Well, I need I need refresh

1471
04:02:03,579 --> 04:02:05,569

04:03:39,260 --> 04:03:41,260
I've got a bunch of scary shit

1481
04:03:41,540 --> 04:04:02,500
Not end of stream. No, no, no, no, no. No, I'm just saying you're gonna beat this game tonight

1482
04:04:02,540 --> 04:04:07,090
I would say the

1483
04:04:07,450 --> 04:04:13,040
Likelihood of me completing this game is 0 so

1484
04:04:13,559 --> 04:04:22,190
This is the only time you're ever going to see me play this game ever. I ain't ever I'm this is it

1485
04:04:22,190 --> 04:04:27,909
I'm playing until I'm done and then I'm done and it's going it's going into the it's going into a box

1486
04:04:28,750 --> 04:04:32,440
Wait, hold on. What's the point of going in here?

1487
04:04:36,479 --> 04:04:40,129
Zerking off in VR. Well, not that

1488
04:04:40,610 --> 04:05:06,049
Where do I there's no way I'm near the end of the game as the last game was like seven hours

1489
04:05:06,590 --> 04:05:10,040
You don't think this one's gonna be at least

1490
04:05:10,799 --> 04:05:13,110
six or seven hours

1491
04:05:13,110 --> 04:05:20,149
Go go go go go

1492
04:05:20,229 --> 04:05:30,469
Give me a fucking break

1493
04:05:34,870 --> 04:05:37,670
Is this in the game? Why is this in the game?

1494
04:05:38,110 --> 04:06:04,319
Whoo, okay. Am I dead? I know the audio tape. I'm not even happy to the audio tapes guys

1495
04:06:04,319 --> 04:06:19,889
There's no way we're after the game. I was gonna say this and I didn't feel that. All right. What's a good McDonald's order?

1496
04:06:20,370 --> 04:06:30,709
What's a good McDonald's order? I'm talking your favorite. That's McDonald's order gets ordered and I'll promise I'll eat it off-stream

1497
04:06:31,350 --> 04:06:47,620
Medium fry. No, I mean large fry always you want about

1498
04:06:49,889 --> 04:06:57,440
McDonald's cheesesteak. Hey, you know what? I actually Wendy's has this new hamburger. What the hell was it? It's a

1499
04:06:58,159 --> 04:07:07,719
It's what's a new cheeseburger. I saw it. I was like, holy shit looks really good. What is it Wendy's thing?

1500
04:07:07,719 --> 04:07:14,079
They it's a pretzel thing. It's a pretzel bun pretzel pub burger. Yeah, anybody had that yet

1501
04:07:14,319 --> 04:07:23,120
That sounds really good. It's a pretzel bun with the pub cheese on it. It's pretty good

1502
04:07:24,020 --> 04:07:35,120
Might have to change my order here. I have to order some Wendy's Uber eats. The sauce is kind of bad

1503
04:07:35,120 --> 04:07:49,709
Oh, that's unfortunate. Is it get a happy meal? It's not weird that it would take five or six happy meals before I was happy

1504
04:07:49,709 --> 04:08:03,790
Right, okay

1505
04:08:06,549 --> 04:08:15,729
Your dad

1506
04:08:15,729 --> 04:08:18,690
It's not good. It's really not good

1507
04:08:19,170 --> 04:08:25,000
It's a bear. No, why am I even doing this? Why waste a lockpick on this pipe?

1508
04:08:25,520 --> 04:08:32,809
That's the kind of insult that the person uses because they know that it's gonna piss you off

1509
04:08:33,329 --> 04:08:46,549
It's not even about you. It's about just me. It's making you angry. What is about you? Hey, your dad sucks

1510
04:08:46,790 --> 04:08:48,750
Like you don't fucking know my dad

1511
04:08:48,750 --> 04:08:58,059
Shut up. Yeah, your dad sucks. Yeah, I saw your mom at the grocery store

1512
04:08:58,059 --> 04:09:01,260
Hey, I'm mrs. Elbertson. I'm here is mom

1513
04:09:01,940 --> 04:09:05,010
That's not what she talks like fuck you buddy

1514
04:09:07,350 --> 04:09:10,670
Get off me stop touching don't touch my face. That's touching my face

1515
04:09:11,270 --> 04:09:31,670
And then you both go to detention. This is personal experience

1516
04:09:37,059 --> 04:09:39,059
This happened the last week

1517
04:09:43,809 --> 04:09:50,209
In my schoolyard you want to talk about a fog jam moment. I'll give you one right there

1518
04:09:50,770 --> 04:10:01,459
Anything but codes have to be

1519
04:10:02,020 --> 04:10:06,049
Fucking four-digit painted on the wall codes

1520
04:10:06,770 --> 04:10:35,440
That was easy not gonna kill me with a shotgun trap this game you would have done it twice

1521
04:10:35,520 --> 04:10:52,479
How do you get back here that kind of an odd spot to be sitting?

1522
04:10:52,479 --> 04:11:09,000

He's too cool for saw 2

04:15:26,129 --> 04:15:28,879
Wait a minute. That's that's a pretty good idea

1550
04:15:29,280 --> 04:15:31,989
That wouldn't a bad idea

Oh, I know it wasn't time. Okay, we're fine. That was a good audio clip

04:23:51,809 --> 04:23:56,549
I didn't even hear it. Go empty your bladder calm down. I'm

1592

Don't worry about me worry about you

1594
04:24:13,479 --> 04:24:16,049
All right. So we gotta be careful in here

1595
04:24:29,969 --> 04:24:48,049
What do you need? That was the guy we let out in the very beginning. It's this guy

1596
04:25:06,819 --> 04:25:10,790
We'll close one by one

1597
04:25:10,790 --> 04:25:12,309
So we have to

1598
04:25:12,309 --> 04:25:13,510
What do we have to do?

1599
04:25:13,510 --> 04:25:35,399
Who do you take it? What do you take advantage of the fuck? Oh, uh, whatever

1600
04:25:38,600 --> 04:25:43,139
Uh, it's all right

1601
04:25:43,219 --> 04:25:46,100
It's all right. I'll clean it up later

1602
04:25:46,840 --> 04:25:48,520
Oh one of these

1603
04:25:48,520 --> 04:25:52,159
That's the color change color

1604
04:25:52,159 --> 04:25:56,159
Do the thing that's in the back of the cereal box here. Maybe uh cuckoo the cocoa puffs bird

1605
04:25:56,879 --> 04:26:02,200
We'll give you a uh, if you set it 10 top boxes. What do we have to do hydration?

1606
04:26:04,559 --> 04:26:06,399
I did it. I just turned them all off

1607
04:26:06,399 --> 04:26:11,920
Let's turn them all on

1608
04:26:11,920 --> 04:26:22,469
I got them all on

1609
04:26:22,469 --> 04:26:35,250
Okay, do it again

1610
04:26:36,200 --> 04:26:47,010
Don't worry. I'm on the case

1611
04:26:48,450 --> 04:26:49,729
I'm coming

1612
04:26:49,729 --> 04:27:07,459
Only one more. Ooh, this one's super tricky

1613
04:27:08,100 --> 04:27:19,299
We're missing here. What are we missing this one down here?

1614
04:27:20,790 --> 04:27:23,829
All right, come up and then tell me give me a big hug

1615
04:27:24,469 --> 04:27:32,520
You'd spring me. What did we ever do to deserve this, right?

1616
04:27:35,489 --> 04:27:40,309
What we did what we do. You gotta make a living. What do you think?

1617
04:27:40,309 --> 04:27:43,030
You're some sort of hero going around rescuing everybody

1618
04:27:43,989 --> 04:27:51,159
Do me a favor and stay out of my way. I don't care about myself. Not anymore. You get out of the sail

1619
04:27:51,639 --> 04:27:55,510
I'm putting you in a fuck you. I'm not going to prison

1620
04:28:02,440 --> 04:28:04,440
Well, uh, you know what? I guess

1621
04:28:04,440 --> 04:28:06,440
We probably let's take a break

1622
04:28:06,440 --> 04:28:10,680
Let's do that. I'll take a break. I will be right back. Give me two seconds

1623
04:28:11,829 --> 04:28:18,760
Just get up. I'll be right back. I'll secure that later

1624
04:28:48,879 --> 04:29:02,049
That sucks. I just grabbed my keyboard like holding WASD. Like the fuck are you doing dude? Hey, i'm back. It's a good break

1625
04:29:13,889 --> 04:29:27,250
No, I didn't skip that

1626
04:29:37,809 --> 04:29:40,260
Snooze

1627
04:29:40,260 --> 04:29:43,909
What a snooze

1628
04:29:43,989 --> 04:29:45,989
Oh my god

1629
04:29:46,709 --> 04:29:48,709
What that's a snooze

1630
04:29:49,270 --> 04:29:54,579
Oh power the elevator again, even this motherfucker is sounds so sick of this

1631
04:30:39,889 --> 04:30:49,590
Key to the elevator every time I've popped into the stream the last few hours you've said snooze

1632
04:30:51,590 --> 04:30:54,709
I I think that's the first time i've said snooze in four and a half hours, man

1633
04:30:55,590 --> 04:31:00,319
I don't think that's accurate

1634
04:31:19,569 --> 04:31:21,250
It's so bizarre

1635
04:31:21,250 --> 04:31:24,879
because

1636
04:31:24,879 --> 04:31:31,170
The animations are in the game. There's a swing animation. There is a you hit me animation

1637
04:31:33,479 --> 04:31:35,479
So why make the whole thing qte?

1638
04:31:38,450 --> 04:31:40,049
last game

1639
04:31:40,049 --> 04:31:42,209
Had combat that wasn't qte

1640
04:31:43,680 --> 04:31:45,280
You're not adding anything

1641
04:31:45,280 --> 04:31:47,680
You're just taking away my ability to interact with the game

1642
04:31:48,239 --> 04:31:53,219
Remember this game jerma says this game sucks. I hate it boring. Oh my god

1643
04:31:54,020 --> 04:31:57,780
Cat so play something else jerma. Wait, what does that say? I want to read that

1644
04:31:59,270 --> 04:32:04,950
This game sucks, I hate it so boring. Oh my god, so play something else chat. The game is not that bad. Calm down

1645
04:32:05,510 --> 04:32:09,750
Yeah, that's you you're accurate. No, no, no, no, hold on. That's not accurate

1646
04:32:10,389 --> 04:32:13,750
I'm having fun playing the game. I'm not having fun playing the game

1647
04:32:14,389 --> 04:32:19,829
You know what I mean? I'm having fun like playing the game and hanging out. I'm not having fun playing the video game

1648
04:32:20,469 --> 04:32:25,350
I'm having fun playing the game here. Not the video game

1649
04:32:25,989 --> 04:32:40,739
There you go. It's a fun experience, but not a fun interaction. Thank you for

1650
04:32:41,989 --> 04:32:43,989
Literally saying the thing I wanted to say

1651
04:32:44,149 --> 04:33:04,959
You're in the cam on good thing. I wasn't naked

1652
04:33:05,680 --> 04:33:13,360
You look a greasy face

1653
04:33:14,000 --> 04:33:15,119
I don't

1654
04:33:15,119 --> 04:33:31,540
Greasy face put on a green screen to cover your nakedness

1655
04:33:32,419 --> 04:33:37,830
I don't know

1656
04:33:37,830 --> 04:33:39,779
Come back

1657
04:33:39,779 --> 04:33:41,299
No

1658
04:33:41,299 --> 04:33:48,599
You don't want me here. You don't want me here. Come back, please

1659
04:33:49,080 --> 04:34:02,880
Come back on please. I will at some point during before the stream ends. I will I promise

1660
04:34:10,659 --> 04:34:13,619
Hmm really look bad here. That's a bad feed

1661
04:34:14,340 --> 04:34:20,290
He was about to tell me something

1662
04:34:20,290 --> 04:34:26,130
Um, so what did that really do for us? I moved that

1663
04:34:29,139 --> 04:34:30,979
Like who fucking cares?

1664
04:34:30,979 --> 04:34:53,319
All right. What's the scariest vr game that's come out that I haven't played I play dread halls

1665
04:34:53,400 --> 04:35:14,549
I think that one's probably number one gross. All right, let me add five nights at freddy's

1666
04:35:18,200 --> 04:35:28,400
Easy listening what I can't wait fucking wendy's and mcdonald's, you know, sometimes just love it

1667
04:35:38,369 --> 04:35:41,319
You're loving it. I'm loving it

1668
04:35:41,400 --> 04:35:44,279
Yeah, that's true

1669
04:35:47,520 --> 04:36:08,150
Don't push it push push push push push push I pull this or you're normalizing being unhealthy

1670
04:36:10,040 --> 04:36:11,490
uh

1671
04:36:11,490 --> 04:36:13,490
I didn't say eat mcdonald's every day

1672
04:36:16,959 --> 04:36:18,959
You know, it didn't go

1673
04:36:19,599 --> 04:36:21,599
Eat mcdonald's every day

1674
04:36:21,919 --> 04:36:23,720
It's not the jingle

1675
04:36:23,720 --> 04:36:26,529
Just because I love it doesn't mean i'm gonna eat it every day

1676
04:36:34,799 --> 04:36:36,799
Have you got a funny ad campaign though?

1677
04:36:46,639 --> 04:36:50,040
He's trying to kill us. I'm not trying to kill anybody

1678
04:36:56,360 --> 04:37:03,860
Now what this is product placement not really

1679
04:37:04,340 --> 04:37:12,340
Oh, I can move this all the way product placement would be if the cam was on and there was a

1680
04:37:13,139 --> 04:37:15,639
There's like a mcdonald's wrapper

1681
04:37:15,799 --> 04:37:18,439
Just on the shelf behind me the whole time

1682
04:37:21,560 --> 04:37:31,680
All right. We'll have to go around again. Why can I not push this?

1683
04:37:32,319 --> 04:37:42,419
I can pull it but I can't push it. Why that's as far as it goes. That's dumb

1684
04:37:57,779 --> 04:37:58,900
cam on

1685
04:37:58,900 --> 04:38:07,299

1686
04:38:07,299 --> 04:38:10,080
Happy am on

1687
04:38:10,080 --> 04:38:24,020
All right. Now we have to leave

1688
04:38:24,099 --> 04:38:32,479
All right, my head's gonna explode. Hold on

1689
04:38:32,479 --> 04:39:00,689
Why is this place on fire? What cam off? Why can I not move this shit? I can't move

1690
04:39:04,119 --> 04:39:27,509
Are you kidding me? This is stupid. Okay

1691
04:39:28,069 --> 04:39:33,119
Turn it on and now lose the shirt

1692
04:39:33,880 --> 04:39:51,639
Wrong website cursed link. I don't know what it is. What is it? Did that do it? Can now I push it?

1693
04:39:52,119 --> 04:39:56,180
It's really cursed. Well now I now I need to know

1694
04:39:59,270 --> 04:40:29,909
Uh, that's not even me. It's not me. Oh, no, it's not it's not me

1695
04:40:30,229 --> 04:40:58,049
Hey, you you fucked with my mouth or something. Yeah, you like fucked with my face. Yes

1696
04:40:58,849 --> 04:41:12,500
Let's go ahead and sneak by

1697
04:41:12,500 --> 04:41:19,009
Uh, have I hit more than three people with an axe in the whole five hours i've been playing I haven't right

1698
04:41:19,490 --> 04:41:35,000
There's melee weapons everywhere for no reason. It's not a single solitary reason to have melee weapons in the game

1699
04:41:35,479 --> 04:41:39,000
It just looks cool to hold I guess

1700
04:41:39,000 --> 04:41:50,310
All right, so that turned off the fire, but who really gives a shit?

1701
04:41:50,869 --> 04:41:58,610
What's this? It's a better link

1702
04:42:04,389 --> 04:42:06,470
Uh, I don't know if I'd call it better

1703
04:42:14,680 --> 04:42:27,409
I'd say it's a little more of the uh, wait someone's talking who's talking

1704
04:42:32,389 --> 04:42:47,799
Where is this guy if we missed something important? There's something cool happened

1705
04:43:02,479 --> 04:43:03,360
Ooh

1706
04:43:03,360 --> 04:43:09,119
Burnt berry, you know

1707
04:43:09,119 --> 04:43:31,750
What do I want to say? He was obsessed with fire 45 minutes sexy open it

1708
04:43:32,310 --> 04:43:35,169
Uh, yeah, yeah

1709
04:43:35,169 --> 04:43:43,090
At least at the very least it's not timed. We all know how much we love that shit

1710
04:43:53,599 --> 04:44:18,919
Okay, how am I gonna get this can't even get that one it's gonna be a split, okay

1711
04:44:20,799 --> 04:44:55,240
Okay, wrong. I hate this shit and don't play it. I yeah, I know you're right. I know you're right 300 people left

1712
04:44:56,200 --> 04:45:13,860
Well, they probably had they probably we talked about mcdonald's if we're getting mcdonald's thousand left

1713
04:45:16,069 --> 04:45:46,819
That's a lot that's a that's a major viewer crash why it's not going why they only come in

1714
04:45:47,139 --> 04:46:20,319
Two things coming out of these ones you can turn the battery. Oh my god. Why did I not even why?

1715
04:46:21,619 --> 04:46:23,619
That saves me so much pain

1716
04:46:40,319 --> 04:47:03,400
Get out of the way. Get out of my way. Get out of my way. Get out of the way. Oh my god, dude burger king

1717
04:47:03,639 --> 04:47:06,279
Oh burger king is here. No way

1718
04:47:07,000 --> 04:47:10,959
Burger king sucks. It is the worst of the three fast food restaurants

1719
04:47:11,200 --> 04:47:19,110
If you have a choice fuck burger king go to wendy's and mcdonald's first every time how's that for an ad?

1720
04:47:27,000 --> 04:47:31,080
Except they're all on the chicken nuggets and their fries are the best

1721
04:47:32,479 --> 04:47:37,759
And I like the way their burger tastes this single just cheeseburger. It's got like a flame broiled flavor to it, but fuck you

1722
04:47:39,759 --> 04:48:04,319
Very open this fries suck. No, that's that's not even real. You know, it's not real

1723
04:48:04,639 --> 04:48:11,330
The burger king fries are actually pretty good. All right, what did I just turn on? Sorry. We're talking about food

1724
04:48:19,060 --> 04:48:37,220
They're the worst. I think uh, you know, okay. The whopper is actually a decent item. It's all right

1725
04:48:38,930 --> 04:48:42,849
No, this one, you know burger king does have one really really good thing over everybody else

1726
04:48:43,409 --> 04:48:46,770
Kind of a weird thing to say but you'll know what i'm talking about if you know

1727
04:48:47,779 --> 04:48:49,779
Uh, they have the best lettuce

1728
04:48:53,430 --> 04:48:55,830
Uh, I didn't die. It didn't blow up my head

1729
04:48:57,939 --> 04:49:00,020
Burger king has the best lettuce on their burgers

1730
04:49:02,119 --> 04:49:04,599
It's crispy and crunchy and watery and like

1731
04:49:05,400 --> 04:49:09,490
It's the only fast food place of the big three that goes

1732
04:49:10,450 --> 04:49:16,659
The lettuce what about the foot lettuce?

1733
04:49:17,400 --> 04:49:21,080
That's that one one guy somewhere in the middle wherever they were

1734
04:49:47,029 --> 04:50:05,650
Yeah, just because one gross person did something gross at a restaurant what's the number 15?

1735
04:50:07,299 --> 04:50:20,950
A secret does burger king have a secret menu. That sounds like a secret menu item. Here comes some coughing

1736
04:50:27,959 --> 04:50:33,590
There

1737
04:50:33,590 --> 04:50:36,340
Oh

1738
04:50:37,060 --> 04:50:39,380
Oh, it's uh, it's it's tank girl

1739
04:50:56,240 --> 04:50:58,240
All right now you turn off your steam

1740
04:50:58,919 --> 04:51:04,400
Fuck you germana. I'm not gonna put that on stream because it's fake. I'm not gonna I'm no i'm not putting it on stream

1741
04:51:08,479 --> 04:51:10,639
You can have your little fantasy. I'm not putting that on stream

1742
04:51:21,000 --> 04:51:23,680
Oh shit, I burnt her

1743
04:51:31,060 --> 04:51:39,439
That didn't like it the game didn't like it, uh, what does that mean?

1744
04:51:41,040 --> 04:51:42,319
Okay

1745
04:51:42,319 --> 04:51:45,040
One omega l8 omega l, right?

1746
04:51:51,090 --> 04:51:53,970
Except this is a playstation 3. Oh, I have to ask a question

1747
04:51:55,080 --> 04:51:56,290
um

1748
04:51:56,290 --> 04:51:59,970
So when I turned the playstation 3 on and for a while after I turned on

1749
04:52:00,930 --> 04:52:03,909
I smelled plastic a hot burning plastic

1750
04:52:04,849 --> 04:52:06,849
Coming out of the vent in the back

1751
04:52:07,009 --> 04:52:09,639
What does that mean?

1752
04:52:10,900 --> 04:52:16,799
Did you get me out of here fuck me get yourself out

1753
04:52:17,520 --> 04:52:22,680
That's normal

1754
04:52:22,680 --> 04:52:24,680
Your ps3 is going through puberty

1755
04:52:27,000 --> 04:52:35,680
Oh, so it's not that one. So which one is it?

1756
04:52:36,979 --> 04:52:37,860
down

1757
04:52:37,860 --> 04:53:00,000
Smells like burger king. Okay. This might be this might sound gross, but it's kind of the reason why I don't hate burger king

1758
04:53:01,159 --> 04:53:03,159
Um, you guys ever use a grill?

1759
04:53:03,639 --> 04:53:06,279
And after you're done cooking the hamburgers on the grill

1760
04:53:07,159 --> 04:53:09,159
Two to three hours later

1761
04:53:09,959 --> 04:53:12,360
The smell that comes from that dirty grill

1762
04:53:13,000 --> 04:53:14,439
You know what i'm saying?

1763
04:53:14,439 --> 04:53:20,119
Like it it that that it's got like meat and grease all over it and cheese on the bottom and shit

1764
04:53:21,349 --> 04:53:23,349
And it has that that old

1765
04:53:23,909 --> 04:53:26,599
grilled smell

1766
04:53:26,599 --> 04:53:31,400
With food, you know, somebody knows what I mean. That's what burger king food smells like it does

1767
04:53:32,279 --> 04:53:36,119
But it smells kind of good

1768
04:53:40,740 --> 04:53:45,779
Clean the grill. No, i'm talking about the grill is clean. I'm talking after you use the grill

1769
04:53:47,779 --> 04:53:50,740
Like an hour later the smell that the grill has

1770
04:53:51,380 --> 04:53:54,900
Of course, I clean the grill, but you gotta wait till the coals cool off

1771
04:53:54,979 --> 04:53:58,020
You know what? You guys you don't clean it immediately. What do you guys forgot propane?

1772
04:53:58,720 --> 04:54:13,319
dorks

1773
04:54:13,319 --> 04:54:15,319
I'm kidding. Um guys, come on

1774
04:54:15,880 --> 04:54:16,840
Really?

1775
04:54:16,840 --> 04:54:23,459
Really? That's where you're gonna end your viewership is there I called you a dork because they use a propane grill. It's been

1776
04:54:23,939 --> 04:54:40,310
10 years that's the one you're going out on i'm just kidding

1777
04:54:41,590 --> 04:54:43,520
Charcoal tastes better though

1778
04:54:43,520 --> 04:54:48,180
It does I gotta get the fuck down there

1779
04:54:52,069 --> 04:54:56,770
Uh, I think charcoal tastes better. I'll give you the pros and cons

1780
04:54:58,119 --> 04:55:00,759
Charcoal is a huge pain in the ass

1781
04:55:01,400 --> 04:55:03,090
It's not worth it

1782
04:55:03,090 --> 04:55:06,639
at all

1783
04:55:06,639 --> 04:55:08,639
It takes so long to get ready

1784
04:55:09,119 --> 04:55:13,759
It takes so much time and effort. The cleanup is fucking horrible

1785
04:55:14,979 --> 04:55:16,020
But

1786
04:55:16,020 --> 04:55:31,040
I think it tastes better than propane

1787
04:55:31,040 --> 04:55:32,799
Am I wrong? I don't think so

1788
04:55:32,799 --> 04:55:40,450
I think i'm kind of wrong. Oh, some of these are fake

1789
04:55:51,009 --> 04:55:58,290
Uh, wait, what?

1790
04:55:58,290 --> 04:56:04,790
Uh, what? I have to do them one at a time

1791
04:56:05,430 --> 04:56:19,080
I think I have to do it one at a time. All right now red

1792
04:56:20,069 --> 04:56:42,759
Wait, are you gonna do it? Okay, cool. Let's do red. Turn it. Did she kill me?

1793
04:56:43,319 --> 04:57:09,779
What did she do? That wasn't correct. It was green. Choose wisely

1794
04:57:11,330 --> 04:57:20,180
Wait, wait, did I already do it? You only need to do blue. Oh

1795
04:57:24,479 --> 04:57:28,319
Oh, yep. That's another thing. Somebody said it another reason why I hate propane. Uh, it's a

1796
04:57:29,119 --> 04:57:30,959
It's a little tube

1797
04:57:30,959 --> 04:57:36,000
That has so much shit under pressure the thing can explode. I don't like it's got gas in there

1798
04:57:36,000 --> 04:57:37,680
You know how much I hate gas

1799
04:57:37,680 --> 04:57:41,799
I'd rather have rocks that get really hot

1800
04:57:43,139 --> 04:57:47,220
Than just gas stuffed in a little container. Where does it all go? How does it fit in there?

1801
04:57:47,459 --> 04:57:49,459
How does it not just blow the fuck up?

1802
04:57:50,470 --> 04:57:51,909
I know

1803
04:57:51,909 --> 04:57:59,939
Nope. Nope. Nope

1804
04:57:59,939 --> 04:58:01,939
It's safe. It doesn't matter. I'd rather have hot rocks

1805
04:58:13,889 --> 04:58:15,889
Taste the meat not the heat

1806
04:58:15,889 --> 04:58:21,830
And I like the way that like that wood charcoal

1807
04:58:22,470 --> 04:58:32,150
I think it adds a lot

1808
04:58:32,150 --> 04:58:35,439
Taste the meat

1809
04:58:35,439 --> 04:58:36,319
No

1810
04:58:36,319 --> 04:58:38,930
Put it on there until it's black

1811
04:58:48,209 --> 04:58:49,729
and then

1812
04:58:49,729 --> 04:59:02,950
Crunch it with your back teeth to try to chew through it. You guys ever cook food for anybody?

1813
04:59:02,950 --> 04:59:04,950
You guys have that have you got you guys have a man in the grill?

1814
04:59:07,569 --> 04:59:08,770
And you know

1815
04:59:08,770 --> 04:59:13,569
That you're just like oh my god, please for the love of all that is sacred. Let me cook this shit, right?

1816
04:59:14,209 --> 04:59:16,209
It's like six people here right now

1817
04:59:16,740 --> 04:59:18,740
It's five people here four people here

1818
04:59:18,979 --> 04:59:21,220
I I need this has to be good

1819
04:59:22,450 --> 04:59:24,290
so you cook

1820
04:59:24,290 --> 04:59:25,799
and

1821
04:59:25,799 --> 04:59:30,119
You uh, yeah, I know what i'm doing. You need help out there. No, i'm good. I'm good

1822
04:59:31,540 --> 04:59:36,979
Hey, what do you like medium? Oh, yeah medium. Well medium rare. I don't know. I don't know how to do any of those

1823
04:59:37,380 --> 04:59:38,900
But i'm gonna say yeah

1824
04:59:38,900 --> 04:59:40,979
To try as hard as I can to make you not throw up

1825
04:59:41,700 --> 04:59:45,619
I'll take medium rare. Oh, I don't know what the fuck that means

1826
04:59:46,020 --> 04:59:48,740
They're all gonna get cooked till uh, like black in the middle

1827
04:59:50,979 --> 04:59:52,979
And then when you finally take the shit off the grill

1828
04:59:54,520 --> 04:59:57,479
And you you go. Oh, yeah. Yeah, don't tell everybody the food's ready yet

1829
04:59:59,779 --> 05:00:02,500
You you take a bite out of a hamburger you make your own hamburger first

1830
05:00:03,060 --> 05:00:06,099
Everyone's still talking and hanging out and okay you bite in is it?

1831
05:00:06,819 --> 05:00:09,110
Is it purple in the middle?

1832
05:00:09,110 --> 05:00:11,110
and if it is

1833
05:00:13,750 --> 05:00:15,349
You put them all back on

1834
05:00:15,349 --> 05:00:21,250
Or the worst part is when somebody else comes over and they want their food

1835
05:00:24,049 --> 05:00:26,950
Shit

1836
05:00:26,950 --> 05:00:30,229
You bite yours right fucking red in the middle. They don't want that

1837
05:00:31,119 --> 05:00:35,540
Oh, man, he's the grill master. There he is. Jeremy the grill master. Let me take a bite of my hamburger

1838
05:00:43,540 --> 05:00:45,540
Pretty good. Hey, yeah

1839
05:00:45,939 --> 05:00:47,939
Hey, look at this guy with the grill

1840
05:00:48,819 --> 05:00:50,099
There he is

1841
05:00:50,099 --> 05:00:54,099
What you don't know is that person over the course of the next 30 minutes

1842
05:00:54,919 --> 05:00:56,919
Is going to take a bite

1843
05:00:56,919 --> 05:01:01,479
Chew it walk into your bathroom spit it into your toilet flush it come out

1844
05:01:01,959 --> 05:01:04,040
Spit it in maybe put it in their hand put it in their pocket and shit

1845
05:01:04,439 --> 05:01:06,439
And they're gonna spit it into the toilet like five times

1846
05:01:07,970 --> 05:01:11,650
That person is going to spit that food over the four or five bathroom trips

1847
05:01:13,279 --> 05:01:15,759
So they don't want you to think that the food was bad

1848
05:01:16,319 --> 05:01:38,259
It's true. Have you done this?

1849
05:01:38,740 --> 05:01:41,560
Yes

1850
05:01:41,560 --> 05:01:47,759
Not into the toilet though

1851
05:01:48,000 --> 05:01:50,000
Just go to the bathroom

1852
05:01:50,319 --> 05:01:53,349
You chew it up

1853
05:01:53,349 --> 05:01:58,310
Dude, I got okay. Somebody gave me a raw steak one time

1854
05:02:00,840 --> 05:02:03,159
And I was like, what the fuck am I gonna do about this?

1855
05:02:09,060 --> 05:02:10,900
So I took the steak

1856
05:02:10,900 --> 05:02:14,099
I opened up my underwear dropped it in my underwear and closed it

1857
05:02:17,669 --> 05:02:20,229
And then I grabbed both my hands on my belly and went

1858
05:02:21,430 --> 05:02:22,950
yummy

1859
05:02:22,950 --> 05:02:43,639
Can I please have the key in your pit? No, i'm fucking kidding

1860
05:02:44,279 --> 05:02:46,520
What's the objective?

1861
05:02:46,520 --> 05:02:58,200
Locate the warehouse

1862
05:02:58,200 --> 05:03:00,200
I don't what what was the point of what I was just doing?

1863
05:03:03,110 --> 05:03:06,869
Can't use this to save clips. Oh, we need to talk about that for a second. Don't we?

1864
05:03:07,509 --> 05:03:13,479
So apparently there's like a bunch. There's like a twitch dmca apocalypse upon us

1865
05:03:14,580 --> 05:03:20,959
Right. I just want to make sure everyone knows this

1866
05:03:23,139 --> 05:03:24,979
I i'm not deleting anything

1867
05:03:24,979 --> 05:03:31,590
I don't save vods on twitch anyways and clips if you want me to delete every single clip i've ever had on this channel

1868
05:03:33,520 --> 05:03:34,319
that's

1869
05:03:34,400 --> 05:03:36,400
Hundreds of thousands of memories

1870
05:03:38,479 --> 05:03:40,479
That will never be recovered

1871
05:03:40,799 --> 05:03:45,560
I'm not i'm not taking them down

1872
05:03:45,560 --> 05:03:49,319
If it comes down to it and there's like a tool I can use or if there's something I can do about it

1873
05:03:50,119 --> 05:03:53,400
But what you I we cannot be expected to just go delete

1874
05:03:54,360 --> 05:04:04,020
Five plus years worth of shit. I mean if I have a copyright now, all right, then give her delete it

1875
05:04:05,490 --> 05:04:09,009
I'm not gonna I that's that's too that's too stressful for me. I'm not gonna do that

1876
05:04:20,659 --> 05:04:26,020
Yeah, if I delete all clips I might catch a few copyright ones, but then the slap disappears forever

1877
05:04:27,509 --> 05:04:29,990
I'm not okay with that. Why would I be okay with that?

1878
05:04:41,810 --> 05:04:52,229
No idea where the fuck i'm going. I I promise I never listen to music ever

1879
05:04:54,099 --> 05:04:58,979
I don't I don't care about music. I don't think about music. I I never listen to music ever ever. I don't care

1880
05:04:59,139 --> 05:05:04,599
I don't listen to it

1881
05:05:04,599 --> 05:05:06,520
I promise I only listen to music

1882
05:05:06,520 --> 05:05:09,159
Uh in a dark room with a bright light on my face

1883
05:05:09,880 --> 05:05:15,599
And I make sure that no one's around I open up all my windows and look what I do any neighbors around

1884
05:05:20,080 --> 05:05:22,959
And I put it on at the lowest volume and I sink down

1885
05:05:22,959 --> 05:05:28,279
I put my fucking ear next to the thing and I hold it there. I hope nobody else fucking hears this

1886
05:05:29,000 --> 05:05:31,959
Don't hope nobody else hears this shit. I'm gonna be in big trouble

1887
05:05:43,110 --> 05:05:51,750
I'm gonna fuck this steak. Don't forget it. I told you I like what do you mean? I that doesn't make sense

1888
05:05:52,389 --> 05:05:57,830
Where the fuck do I go?

1889
05:05:59,939 --> 05:06:02,979
I'm about to rage quit the game. Oh, no, I can't I can't be here

1890
05:06:03,459 --> 05:06:30,610
Did you come on the tv and say hello again, uh peter is this it you're too far in

1891
05:06:32,950 --> 05:06:34,950
Yeah, no, that's accurate

1892
05:06:34,950 --> 05:06:47,619
I really am

1893
05:06:47,619 --> 05:06:49,619
Uh, I just got 50 dollars

1894
05:06:50,240 --> 05:06:51,779
5,000 bits

1895
05:06:51,779 --> 05:06:55,220
from espada escalada thanks to the 5,000 bits

1896
05:06:56,599 --> 05:06:58,040
50 bucks

1897
05:06:58,040 --> 05:07:02,680
Keeping clips is just another reason. You're the best streamer on the internet. Also. Here's 50 dollars for your lawsuit

1898
05:07:05,380 --> 05:07:10,200
I

1899
05:07:10,200 --> 05:07:15,669
look I

1900
05:07:15,750 --> 05:07:17,750
YouTube did this similar thing before

1901
05:07:18,229 --> 05:07:21,799
And it scared the shit out of everybody

1902
05:07:21,799 --> 05:07:28,040
I'm gonna wait for more info. I'm gonna wait until it's really like yeah, if you have

1903
05:07:29,000 --> 05:07:35,009
You're getting deleted. I want a little bit more info. I'm not removing

1904
05:07:35,569 --> 05:07:38,930
It's like six years of everything i've ever done

1905
05:07:39,490 --> 05:07:41,090
I'm not gonna do it

1906
05:07:41,090 --> 05:07:47,400
I want more info

1907
05:07:47,400 --> 05:07:50,529
Speaking of more info

1908
05:07:50,529 --> 05:07:52,529
What the fuck am I supposed to do right now?

1909
05:07:52,849 --> 05:08:11,959
You should switch to blender. I think the game's telling you to quit

1910
05:08:15,360 --> 05:08:16,639
Okay

1911
05:08:16,639 --> 05:08:23,680
I this is like the only way I can really go

1912
05:08:24,240 --> 05:08:29,590
But I can't go this way the elevator. Yeah, I can't press. I need a key for the elevator

1913
05:08:29,590 --> 05:08:43,860
I can't press the button burn cam on you lost another hundred viewers. Stop saying that

1914
05:08:44,500 --> 05:08:48,659
Don't you know that when you say that it makes me feel like it's self-conscious that people may have left the stream

1915
05:08:49,619 --> 05:08:51,939
Don't say that to me. Don't do that to me

1916
05:08:52,659 --> 05:08:57,750
The fuck do I go I can't do the elevator

1917
05:09:06,560 --> 05:09:07,439
Like don't don't worry

1918
05:09:07,439 --> 05:09:11,119
I know why they left because I've walked in a circle four times because this game

1919
05:09:12,159 --> 05:09:18,400
I know I get it. It's all right. Don't you don't have to a hundred people. No, I'm beside why didn't 5 000 of you leave?

1920
05:09:19,040 --> 05:09:24,689
Let's don't put don't go stay

1921
05:09:24,689 --> 05:09:28,849
Watch me continue to do the same thing over and over again expecting differently else. What is the definition?

1922
05:09:31,060 --> 05:09:34,060
Sanity it's down

1923
05:09:45,060 --> 05:09:56,529
Help me

1924
05:09:56,529 --> 05:09:58,799
Help me

1925
05:09:58,799 --> 05:10:00,799
Why am I really trapped here?

1926
05:10:04,680 --> 05:10:06,040
Why?

1927
05:10:06,040 --> 05:10:08,040
No, help me. Why?

1928
05:10:09,400 --> 05:10:11,400
Cry cry cry

1929
05:10:11,639 --> 05:10:20,790
Go to the storage room the fucking storage room

1930
05:10:22,599 --> 05:10:25,240
40 mcnuggets. Holy shit. That's a good idea

1931
05:10:28,209 --> 05:10:29,889
storage warehouse

1932
05:10:29,889 --> 05:10:33,509
Let's see. I think it's broken. The game is broken

1933
05:10:34,869 --> 05:10:36,229
The game's broken

1934
05:10:36,229 --> 05:10:38,319
It's a broken game

1935
05:10:38,319 --> 05:10:40,319
And I think i'm running around like an idiot

1936
05:10:40,400 --> 05:10:53,119
The door it's not opening

1937
05:10:53,119 --> 05:11:07,779
Okay, how do I die? Wait, hold on there's a hidden key behind the ladder and then you called me an idiot

1938
05:11:07,779 --> 05:11:10,340
But wouldn't a hidden key mean it's I don't see it

1939
05:11:10,900 --> 05:11:17,349
Yeah, the game is hard crashed. It's actually hard crashed

1940
05:11:25,330 --> 05:11:31,380
Oh

1941
05:11:31,380 --> 05:11:33,970
Come on

1942
05:11:33,970 --> 05:11:35,970
You give me like a reason to end the stream game

1943
05:11:37,889 --> 05:11:45,000
For tomorrow for vr scary night y'all you're gonna come to vr night tomorrow. It's gonna be scary

1944
05:11:47,299 --> 05:11:49,060
I think it's gonna be scary

1945
05:11:52,200 --> 05:12:00,450
Whatever plans you have tomorrow whatever streamer you plan on watching it better be me

1946
05:12:00,930 --> 05:12:15,439
You understand i'm gonna do 100 nugget challenge after two

1947
05:12:16,479 --> 05:12:21,750
No, i'm not. All right. Well, this is all right. This is what this is a good place to end it

1948
05:12:21,750 --> 05:12:25,990
It's been five hours. I only streamed for four six hours anyways now because of my boomer back

1949
05:12:26,310 --> 05:12:34,610
It's a good place to take a break and get some food. This game was terrible, but I had to give it a chance

1950
05:12:35,250 --> 05:12:43,040
How could it be worse than the first one? I have no idea another 50 dollars from wade. Thanks wade for the 50 bucks

1951
05:12:43,279 --> 05:12:48,790
There's no messages. That's it

1952
05:12:48,790 --> 05:12:54,209
Well, I had look I had fun on the stream didn't have fun in the game that sometimes that's okay

1953
05:12:54,209 --> 05:13:00,400
That's a lot of fun. I can still have fun. So tomorrow

1954
05:13:00,959 --> 05:13:06,709
We are going to play vr walking dead vr

1955
05:13:08,709 --> 05:13:17,799
The exorcist vr I might be making that up. Um, a couple of the scary games. Yeah. Yeah, the exorcist legion

1956
05:13:17,799 --> 05:13:24,889
That's the one gonna be terrifying and I think I might start tomorrow

1957
05:13:27,569 --> 05:13:28,529
I want to be at night

1958
05:13:28,610 --> 05:13:35,569
Something about playing a scary game and you take off the headset and there's just a bright sun in your room now

1959
05:13:35,569 --> 05:13:46,319
I want to be dark and nighttime and we'll see but it doesn't matter. We'll start at two specific

1960
05:13:49,759 --> 05:13:52,000
I know that's still late for a lot of people. Yeah, I know we'll do two

1961
05:13:52,159 --> 05:14:01,299
Well, that was saw to the game that uh half of you demanded I play for months

1962
05:14:01,619 --> 05:14:23,479
Hope it was worth it and i'll see you tomorrow do a cam before you leave. Sure. How you doing good?

1963
05:14:23,880 --> 05:14:34,240
We're good. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. You like it when my eyes are wider like this like this

1964
05:14:35,909 --> 05:14:52,080
What makes you connect with me more as a streamer like this or like this when you squint? Okay, cool

1965
05:14:52,240 --> 05:15:05,110
Let's get the credits rolling. Thanks for the subs everybody. There was a lot of community subs tonight. I'm gonna go

1966
05:15:05,349 --> 05:15:10,709
Uh uber eats some I can't fucking believe I couldn't read an analog clock like three hours ago

1967
05:15:10,950 --> 05:15:19,830
It's unbelievable to me like holy shit. I had cvd man cvd drops. I can't fucking believe it

1968
05:15:19,909 --> 05:15:25,959
I cannot believe it. That's worse than the omega symbol. It's the worst thing i've ever done on stream

1969
05:15:25,959 --> 05:15:34,930
Probably I couldn't read the fucking analog clock. I was trying so hard too. That's the worst part

1970
05:15:35,009 --> 05:15:39,810
I was it was so embarrassing and i'm sitting there desperately being like what is the five one?

1971
05:15:46,389 --> 05:15:51,840
Like you have to be making that up you have to be pretending no one can be convinced that that was not real

1972
05:15:53,759 --> 05:15:55,830
There's no way

1973
05:15:55,830 --> 05:16:11,060
It's impossible. Anyways, let's get the credits on. Thanks again everybody. Here are all the subs tonight

1974
05:16:14,180 --> 05:16:19,220
Thank you for your insane support that I continue to get for some reason

1975
05:16:21,319 --> 05:16:32,159
Thanks a lot somebody said germa if your ps3 is still making that burning smell check under your disc tray

1976
05:16:32,240 --> 05:16:41,750
Mine usually does that does that if it's oil is low ps3 has oil. No, it doesn't

1977
05:16:43,720 --> 05:16:44,919
Like a car

1978
05:16:44,919 --> 05:17:01,990
What the fuck i'm just imagining windshield wipers on this thing and you press a button

1979
05:17:05,560 --> 05:17:33,680
Just wipe the top. All right where i'm gonna send i'm gonna send you guys to kitboga tonight. Oh say hello

1980
05:17:34,000 --> 05:17:43,139
I actually saw the the he has this thing where it's like an ai that automatically talks to the scammers

1981
05:17:44,580 --> 05:17:50,799
It's like a text-to-speech like ai bot or something. That's insane. It's absolutely insane

1982
05:17:51,279 --> 05:18:02,020
It's hysterical. I think he's coding. I don't think he's calling uh scammers tonight. I think he's just chilling coding

1983
05:18:03,409 --> 05:18:11,090
That sounds pretty chill. I think I might hang out there with my mcdonald's uber eats go say hello

1984
05:18:11,569 --> 05:18:25,299
I'll see you guys tomorrow for vr scary shit. Goodbye. Good night. Have a wonderful rest of your night. Take care guys. See you soon. Goodbye
