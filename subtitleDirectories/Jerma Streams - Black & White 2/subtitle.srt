1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:09,830
And the word milk. That's gonna be kind of hard considering that there will be a cow on stream

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:21,160
for the next... up to two hours I think. I'm just getting high guys. How you doing? Good afternoon.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:32,899
I love doing the up to certain amount of time for streams because it could be anything. Yeah,

4
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:41,289
this one's gonna be up to eight hours. That could be 20 minutes. 20 minutes or eight hours. Pick one.

5
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:51,429
Yeah, we're gonna do black and white too today. It's running. It's in 1080p and it looks glorious.

6
00:00:51,429 --> 00:01:02,250
I'm also trialing out a new brace. I've got Boomer Brace 2.0. It's a little different. I'm

7
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:11,099
just... you gotta get used to it. Might need to loosen it a little bit. It's been upgraded

8
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:19,829
and eventually we're gonna upgrade until I'm Dr. Octopus. But yeah, we're gonna... we can

9
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,430
get started here in a second. Let me just make sure the tweet went through. We can get started

10
00:01:23,430 --> 00:02:39,500
in about a minute, two minutes. You're back. Okay. Are we ready? Are we ready to begin?

11
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:53,939
Black and white 2. There we go. Now spoilers. No, no, no spoilers. No spoilers. All right. Let's get

12
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:03,560
out of this. I don't want to know what's possible. I want to get in here blind. This is black and

13
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,080
white 2. I just loaded it to check out to make sure it could get captured well and that it was

14
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,300
in 1080 fucking pretty, dude. And it is. I got all the fan patches to make sure the game runs.

15
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:27,139
Let's hope we got a good case here. New game. Let's go. Are you guys ready for the Moo Crew?

16
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:06,569
I'm a meteor that's about to crash into Earth.

17
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:24,310
I'm coming. I've answered your prayers. We're back on God Island like last game.

18
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,110
We're your conscience. We're part of you. Looks way better than the last one. You'll be the God

19
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:38,230
you want to be. So we'll guide you as you make your godly way through whatever this world

20
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:44,470
throws. But before then, you'll want to learn the big. We'll help you with all that. But even more

21
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:51,029
importantly, you'll need a creature. Yes. Let's go and choose one. Who is it going to be? What do

22
00:04:51,029 --> 00:05:01,620
you guys think? Who's it going to be? I wonder. There they are. Wonderful, aren't they? You have

23
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,660
four to choose from, but the one you choose will be with you throughout your whole time in this

24
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,620
world. So consider carefully. Monkey? No. Make your choice wisely. Absolutely not. We'll tell you

25
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:22,420
about these amazing beasts. All creatures can be trained to become lovable mischievous

26
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:29,779
pets. Or they can be the ultimate disciplined weapons of destruction and war. Look at Varian.

27
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,180
He's just so curious. Can become these things. That's the wonder of a god's creature.

28
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,899
Don't stop zooming in on the monkey. I want to see them. I want to see them.

29
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:47,699
All creatures will grow up to be huge and powerful. They can be cute,

30
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:54,579
quirky pets, inquisitive and fun. The graphics is so much better. They can be single-minded

31
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:58,500
war machines. Can I see what the other ones look like when they get older?

32
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,620
All creatures will be as good or evil as you teach them to be.

33
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:15,500
Now snooze. Boring. Snore. Snore. Yeah, right. I'd rather they spread love in

34
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,339
the form of a massacre or two. By going into battle, creatures can live for war,

35
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:29,259
domination and destruction. Such a shame if you ask me. No, I don't know. Now this is what I'm

36
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:39,579
talking about right here. I love them. Oh, he did it. They all have their own lives,

37
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:45,019
but you need to be a responsible parent and not overfeed them. Oh, he's barfed to the shit. Yep,

38
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:50,620
gotta be the cow. Cow's the best animal. Now it's time to choose. He did a book of eight. I

39
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,040
thought you'd know he's perfect. That might be a little loud. Let me turn it down. It's a little

40
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:05,899
too loud, isn't it? All right, so hold on. It's a little loud. Yeah, it's maxed out. Let's go like,

41
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:17,939
bring it down a tad. Okay. Yes. All right. Let's see. Let's give them all a chance,

42
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:25,860
but we already know what our vote is. What's wrong with this one? Why was this one just sad?

43
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:34,740
Oh, look at him. Wait, is he gonna pick me? Remember me from last game? I was so funny.

44
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,519
Oh, he looks unsure. I have never been so sure of anything in my whole life.

45
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,519
That was awesome. Why is everybody so sad?

46
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:15,579
It's a baby. What? What was that? You know, let's, let's just do it.

47
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,139
Yeah, it's different. There's like, there's different shit here.

48
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,059
Yeah, I'm gonna do it. This is different than last year for manipulating the world.

49
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:43,580
It's not just drag buttons. Your view around the world like this. And why is your frame rating

50
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:49,340
when you do it? Hold down. Yes. All right. So it's right. Click this time to the right.

51
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,220
Just carry on dragging. Hold right. Okay. That was gonna say that didn't work.

52
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:07,779
Great work. Now we must move to our right. To move right, hold down the movement button,

53
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:14,820
then drag the mouse to the left. Bad PC. Wonderful. Just follow the arrows.

54
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,460
It's a lot better looking than black and white one for sure.

55
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:26,740
One hop this time. One hop this time. Two hops this time. That's pretty good.

56
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:36,019
I don't have a bad PC. You have a bad PC. Let's keep going. Click and hold the ground.

57
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:43,220
Then move the mouse back to pull yourself forwards. Follow the arrows to get back to your

58
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,419
creature. Excuse me. Hold on. It's just taking. Wait, there were a couple of winks that came in.

59
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:54,440
What do you think about fucking boomer brace 2.0? This has got, this has got fucking titanium in

60
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,279
the middle. There's steel in here. What do you think about boomer brace fucking 2.0 guy?

61
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:13,860
He's pretty good. Oh yeah. He's bulletproof. He's bulletproof.

62
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,820
Super villain. I know. And whilst keeping the movement button down, drag the mouse back.

63
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:34,580
Isn't that? That's what I'm doing. Game. Hold. Pull. That's what I'm doing. Hold. Pull. Hold. Pull.

64
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,259
Hold. Right click. Pull. What? Why is this? It's kind of finicky.

65
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,580
Now why is it working now? Weird. My fucking whatever. The creature is moving behind us.

66
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,700
We must pan backwards to find him. All right. Pan. Yep. That's working fine now.

67
00:10:54,659 --> 00:11:06,730
I love that run. Look at his legs. Well done. Evil German. Whatever. I know this looks like

68
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,850
an evil villain origin story. It's going to keep going until I have my whole head is made out of

69
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:22,019
metal. Now we shall learn to rotate your view. Hold the middle mouse button down and drag from

70
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,340
side to side to rotate your view. Yeah. Last time it wasn't that.

71
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:34,980
Click and hold in the highlighted area. Who cares? I'm doing it correct.

72
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,370
Now whilst keeping the middle mouse button down, drag the mouse left.

73
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:56,090
Click and hold the middle mouse button in the highlighted area.

74
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,610
I was in there. Click and hold in the highlighted area.

75
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,850
You didn't even click in the right spot.

76
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:10,570
Lovely. Keep the middle. This is going very well. Now.

77
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:18,090
Click the middle mouse button in the highlighted area and hold it down.

78
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,250
Now whilst keeping the middle mouse button down, push the mouse forward.

79
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,889
I just want to hug Murius. What's wrong with Murius?

80
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,730
There is one last thing, Leader. Learning to zoom in and out.

81
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:43,049
He's doing like a depressed dance. What? What's with the depressed dance?

82
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,889
Holy shit, that was bad.

83
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:52,340
Now try zooming towards the creature. Excellent work. Wonderful. You showed remarkable skill,

84
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,700
Leader. Way to go, boys. Sorry I couldn't help but you know places to be.

85
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,899
All the controls you just learned can be used to move around the world.

86
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:11,350
Can you please say it, Leader? Sure.

87
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,350
This is a gold scroll. These lead you through the story.

88
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,860
Silver scrolls lead the closest in the world.

89
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,740
Is this the wink? Fuck.

90
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:31,769
Bronze scrolls are tutorials which can teach you so much.

91
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,929
Double click the movement button on the ground there to zoom to it quickly.

92
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,960
That's actually a really good feature to know.

93
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,480
I've seen bronze tutorial scroll here, boys.

94
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,720
That's a good feature to know.

95
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,860
Move the hand over the rock and hold down the action button to pick it up.

96
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,500
Once you've got hold of it, release the button.

97
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,980
So let's move all these rocks out of the circle.

98
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,940
Was it in the original game? I don't remember.

99
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,299
Oh, that's it. You picked up the rock like an expert.

100
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,100
This is different though.

101
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,899
Now move it outside the circle and click the action button again to drop it on the ground.

102
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,899
It used to be you had to hold and then let go.

103
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,100
Now I have to let go.

104
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,659
You've fooled it beautifully. Well done.

105
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,899
Reminds me of my cricketing days.

106
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,980
Yeah, this is a little different.

107
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,820
Watch out!

108
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,070
You have received 1,000 tribute and you thoroughly deserve it.

109
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,379
Tribute is good.

110
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,940
Another bronze scroll. So much to learn and so little time.

111
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,580
You know, virgins are wonderfully versatile.

112
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,220
They can do so much in the world.

113
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,740
You can simply pick up a villager and put him or her next to something.

114
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,419
The villager will take this as divine inspiration and become a disciple.

115
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,220
Hype train game.

116
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,019
Hype train game. What's that? A hype train?

117
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:10,700
Holy shit.

118
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,929
Yeah, you used to have to click and hold.

119
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:19,049
Now you just click once.

120
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,210
Disciple farmer.

121
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:25,289
This person is safely working at the farm.

122
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:30,330
Don't look, leader.

123
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,409
The breeders are doing whatever it is such people do.

124
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:35,049
What does it look like?

125
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,179
Builder, breeders, farmers.

126
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,179
You see, we got a builder.

127
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,679
Well, you don't need that.

128
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,080
It's fine.

129
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,559
What about you?

130
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:51,620
Forrester.

131
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,860
Disciple forrester.

132
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,299
And this guy is chopping trees for wood.

133
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,980
You got all that, boss?

134
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,480
I do.

135
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,259
And to prove it, there's a thousand tributes waiting for you.

136
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,299
Why not explore the land?

137
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,019
Click on the silver scrolls when you see them.

138
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,980
Click on the gold scroll on the big mountain to leave.

139
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,980
All right. Tutorial done.

140
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,190
I get it.

141
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,429
Is there any new information that I need to know that's not in this?

142
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,870
Uh, no, that was like a little refresher course.

143
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:27,620
Oh, this is scrolling my chat.

144
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,759
Oh, that's not good.

145
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,789
That's not good at all.

146
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:37,659
Actually, uh, might have to, um, I can't see chat now.

147
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:38,460
Uh-oh, hold on.

148
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,100
Um, might have to open up the third party program here to see you guys.

149
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,269
Might have to open up.

150
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,389
What about another window?

151
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,549
I'm gonna have to open up on a phone.

152
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,159
Let's see.

153
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,580
Okay.

154
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,860
Yeah, I can do it like this.

155
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,419
This is fine.

156
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,059
All right.

157
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:01,379
We're good.

158
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,139
I got you in a new window.

159
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:06,019
All right.

160
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:08,099
So let's do, um, what's the side quest?

161
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,089
If there is a God up there and you can hear me, please help me out.

162
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,210
I mean, my life is in ruins.

163
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,569
A rock has rolled onto my lovely garden.

164
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,569
I've been trying to move it, but it's too big and heavy.

165
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,809
If ever a man needs a God, I'm him.

166
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,890
Please hear my prayer.

167
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:39,339
Who's he to ask us to move a rock for him?

168
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,140
Let's teach him a lesson.

169
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,059
No, no, that's wrong.

170
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,779
A knockdown is like laundry.

171
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:47,819
Nothing without them.

172
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,819
There's a lot.

173
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,140
All right.

174
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,859
You, all right.

175
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:52,619
You, you got lucky today.

176
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:55,099
I, you'll, I just, you got saved by the laundry.

177
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:58,890
The rock is gone.

178
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,049
My garden is rockless.

179
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:02,730
Marvelous.

180
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,930
You moved the rock.

181
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,970
The man is happy and all is well.

182
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,250
Oh, is this how it's going to be, boss?

183
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,049
Win in the hearts of this world's people.

184
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,329
You've just received.

185
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:19,369
Why is the tree bowing?

186
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,670
Oh, okay.

187
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,710
Nice.

188
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,950
All right.

189
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,470
So we got some tribute there.

190
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,910
Let's just keep, let's keep moving around.

191
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,730
Need some more side quests.

192
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,730
It's a lot smoother than the last game too.

193
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,690
Wait, is this, let me guess.

194
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,490
Is this going to be throw a rock over here?

195
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,569
A silver scroll.

196
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,589
The waterfall is blocked.

197
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:47,779
What will we do now?

198
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:49,940
This is awful.

199
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,579
Don't worry.

200
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,660
We'll think of something.

201
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
What about the animals that built this dam?

202
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,339
What about the beavers?

203
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:00,420
Objects can prove very useful in both defense and attack.

204
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,099
Tools through an object.

205
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,619
First, pick it up.

206
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,539
Then, whilst keeping the action.

207
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:07,940
What if I remove the rock beavers?

208
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,259
In the direction you want to throw.

209
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,900
Release the button when you want to let go of the object.

210
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,019
Same tutorial.

211
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:14,900
Oh, mega lull.

212
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:17,380
Rock beavers.

213
00:19:22,490 --> 00:20:07,819
Oh, oh, oh, oh, all right.

214
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,099
It's too much or too little.

215
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:09,819
What the fuck?

216
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:12,380
What the fuck?

217
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,900
Oh my, okay.

218
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,380
Come on.

219
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,720
Jesus.

220
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,039
What?

221
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,029
I don't even need to die.

222
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,829
That's hard.

223
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:34,630
That's really hard.

224
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,269
Well done.

225
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,799
Lockage has been cleared.

226
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,539
Try another.

227
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:47,180
Nice shooting.

228
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:48,619
Oh, fun.

229
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,619
I'm so excited.

230
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,140
I can't tell you how excited I am.

231
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,819
I can't wait for Murius to grow into a full grown cow.

232
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,779
And point to the point and go.

233
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,019
That's my favorite.

234
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:05,740
That's all I care about.

235
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:15,369
We could help their friends by moving them.

236
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,329
So they can be together in the main valley.

237
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,289
Okay.

238
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:24,150
Isn't that sweet?

239
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,789
A little lost valley of people.

240
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,809
Where do we put them?

241
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:32,619
You hold the nun.

242
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:33,019
We're here.

243
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:35,740
Great.

244
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,299
Welcome home.

245
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,539
The nomad is in the right valley.

246
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:44,029
Good.

247
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,990
This is unethical.

248
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,710
Oh, is this unethical?

249
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,750
I'm doing like a nice thing.

250
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,390
I'll show you unethical.

251
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,589
Would you like to see unethical?

252
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,750
Next time, walk on your own.

253
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,279
I mean, is that unethical?

254
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,920
Or is it mean?

255
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,599
You rescued everyone.

256
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,160
Look, you received 1,000 tribute.

257
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,359
Why are they punching each other?

258
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:38,569
You stink.

259
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:42,069
The land is complete, leader.

260
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,910
Click the gold scroll on top of the mountain to regress.

261
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,470
Here we go.

262
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:50,390
We're going to the top of the mountain.

263
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,740
It's time for Murius.

264
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,940
This is where Murius has to go do his fucking shaman quest.

265
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,019
To go get chain lightning.

266
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,980
Are you sure you wish to leave the land?

267
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,500
Click again to confirm.

268
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,109
We got a little refresher.

269
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:14,869
They didn't expect that.

270
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:16,549
Split one, villager.

271
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,660
Now you've had a taste of your powers.

272
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,380
We're ready to visit our mighty Greek capital.

273
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,019
Yeah.

274
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:26,579
Full of people that worship us.

275
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,890
What?

276
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,150
Please hear us.

277
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,789
Can you hear them?

278
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:33,750
Please help us.

279
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,430
That's a pure prayer.

280
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,190
That's weird.

281
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,109
It sounds like something terrible has happened.

282
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:39,750
Worship.

283
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:44,309
Mighty one, please heed up.

284
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:48,390
Our armies are crushed.

285
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,710
What's left of us hides in this city from the brutal Aztecs.

286
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,950
And now they are at our walls.

287
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,750
I implore you, please help us.

288
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,230
Oh, that's a lot of people.

289
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,789
Wait, what?

290
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,579
That's like 5,000 people.

291
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:10,960
Wait, damn.

292
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,700
Our city is under siege.

293
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,119
Killed nearly all our troops.

294
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,000
What am I supposed to do?

295
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,839
You're all going to die.

296
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:21,819
Look at the pig.

297
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:23,099
The pig just sitting there.

298
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,539
Save the villagers.

299
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,059
Save the village from the archers.

300
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:27,599
What?

301
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,769
Pick up the villagers and place them in the portal over here.

302
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,369
Where they'll be taken to safety.

303
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:36,589
Okay.

304
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,319
You've got a village report.

305
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,799
Yes, you put them down in the right place.

306
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,119
Am I just seeing that?

307
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,880
Do they have a god?

308
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,359
Oh my Jesus Christ.

309
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,039
Oh, those weren't people.

310
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:56,599
Okay, it's all right.

311
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,319
Those weren't people.

312
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,680
That was just a bunch of pots.

313
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,640
Those weren't people.

314
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,140
They were pots.

315
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:11,480
Okay, those are people.

316
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,319
Those were people at that time.

317
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,380
Those were people.

318
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,400
What's happening?

319
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
Watch that rumble.

320
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,759
That creature seems to be performing some strange ritual.

321
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,319
And he's huge.

322
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:26,819
We just have a baby.

323
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,819
We can't do anything about this.

324
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,779
Go get him, Murius.

325
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:45,829
Let's save as many villages as we can and get out of here.

326
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:46,390
I don't think we even...

327
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,470
I think Murius is still like in a crib somewhere.

328
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:57,190
What are these crazed ass tics doing?

329
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:58,910
Um...

330
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:01,849
Crushed down villages with barrels.

331
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:04,349
Oh my God.

332
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:05,309
This is horrible.

333
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,000
This huge fire...

334
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,039
There are some more barrels...

335
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,240
Wait, I can do that too.

336
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,839
Pull the god fence away.

337
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,660
Who's invading...

338
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,299
I've learned.

339
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,599
Why the hell...

340
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,240
They do like...

341
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,359
Were those jumps?

342
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:29,359
We can set these bales of hay on fire and rule them down to deal with the platoons down there.

343
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,960
Pick up the flaming stick and hold it over the hay bales.

344
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,710
Here we go.

345
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:36,769
Burn.

346
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:42,240
All right, that was a lot.

347
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,609
Another volcano.

348
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,450
You can make volcanoes in this game?

349
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,529
Before you could just like shoot lightning bolts out of your hands and throw fireballs.

350
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,130
You can make a fucking volcano.

351
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,069
Murius could just like water plants before.

352
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:31,680
Okay.

353
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,920
So we just...

354
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,880
All right, so the ass tics just destroyed everybody.

355
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,380
Okay.

356
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,099
Let's go.

357
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,160
Now we've got the story.

358
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:55,650
Once they save Murius, they're gonna instantly say,

359
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,009
You are now our best friend.

360
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:01,920
Let's go back.

361
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,119
The portal.

362
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,240
Yeah, these guys made it.

363
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,640
But think of how many got toasted.

364
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,440
Anyway, where are we?

365
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,559
This looks like an old Greek settlement.

366
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,039
We can reestablish ourselves here.

367
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,640
It looks so peaceful here with no Aztecs.

368
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,799
It's the perfect place to build up and get more followers.

369
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,680
There is already...

370
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,519
Who's the guy that you followed for two hours?

371
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,400
We don't talk about that.

372
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,240
A field which we can use.

373
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,440
That's deleted from the blog.

374
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,640
He is the extent of your influence.

375
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,759
You can only do things within this ring.

376
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:44,240
You can extend the green influence ring by placing more buildings and having more people.

377
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,740
Yeah.

378
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:50,690
When you're ready to learn how to feed your people,

379
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,809
click on the gold scroll over the field leader.

380
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:57,740
Oh, what's that?

381
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,380
What did it just do?

382
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:01,650
Let me take a look what we got.

383
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,609
What we got working with here?

384
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:13,710
Who sleeps like this?

385
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,980
It's just...

386
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,900
He's sleeping with one leg in the air crossed over

387
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,900
because he's farting so much that he has to sleep in this position.

388
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,619
He has to sleep in the constant I'm gonna fart position.

389
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:41,180
That's unbelievable.

390
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,059
It's still funny.

391
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:46,220
Your villagers are going to need food very soon, leader.

392
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,140
Move your hand over this field,

393
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,660
then click and hold the action button to pick up the grain.

394
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,259
When you've got 200 food in your hand,

395
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,740
drop all through it into the storehouse.

396
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:05,380
Enough food in there, boss.

397
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,019
How much do I need?

398
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:08,180
Can I hold?

399
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,500
And it goes...

400
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,539
We now have enough food.

401
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:13,460
We need to get our people working.

402
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,539
This is so much better than the last one.

403
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:16,579
It actually tells me...

404
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:20,740
Villagers can be turned into disciples who will work at the job you assign them.

405
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,940
Pick up a villager, then put them down on a field.

406
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,799
Yeah, that's so much better.

407
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,160
I can actually see who's working here.

408
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,180
Now place the villager down over the field.

409
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,019
You going for it?

410
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,859
One of the seven, two out of seven.

411
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:39,740
Okay, good.

412
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,180
Reestablish the village, yes.

413
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,630
Fill it up.

414
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,029
Those farmers can handle that small field with no problem, boss.

415
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:51,069
They actually knew what this game was supposed to be on the first one.

416
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:53,390
And our town expand.

417
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,869
Grab and pull a tree out of the ground and drop it into the storehouse.

418
00:30:57,869 --> 00:30:58,430
You can still do that.

419
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:58,829
That's good.

420
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:00,430
When it gets desperate.

421
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:06,720
Owls and tribute.

422
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,920
Got some wood.

423
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,680
Do I have any choppers?

424
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,960
Some disciple foresters to collect wood for us.

425
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,720
Pick up a villager and drop them next to a tree to make them a disciple forester.

426
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,039
Make a total of three foresters.

427
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,640
Make two disciple foresters.

428
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,680
Now place the villager next to a tree.

429
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,400
We got some nifty foresting going on, boss.

430
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,819
No, I didn't.

431
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:38,619
All right, they're gone.

432
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:47,259
As of February 20th, 2022, links are gone.

433
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:47,980
Not links.

434
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,619
Well, that just shows how much, well, that's how I really feel.

435
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:51,900
What was I saying?

436
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,539
Winks are gone.

437
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:01,950
I was trying to drop it in here.

438
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,819
There's a wink right there.

439
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:11,619
It's changing.

440
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,220
It's changing this next week.

441
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,980
Click on the gold scroll.

442
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:24,960
April?

443
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,000
No, not April.

444
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,599
That's like two months from now.

445
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,079
The statues on your town center represent your town's desires.

446
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,920
This shows what your people would like to build next.

447
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,480
Keeping your people happy is important.

448
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,200
They will let you know if they desire a building type.

449
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,950
See how the statue is carrying grain?

450
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,150
That means you want food.

451
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,950
That represents the people's desires for food.

452
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,750
If they need ore or wood, they will let you know.

453
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,109
Keep an eye on the statue as it will change.

454
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,299
Why is he wearing a backpack?

455
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,019
This place's height represents how good or evil you are.

456
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:04,740
A fucking backpack.

457
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,900
From the top, a flame or a fountain will spring as you perform your good deeds.

458
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,380
The whole city will shift to show you if you are good or evil.

459
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:21,299
This statue lets you know your people's desires.

460
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,299
Watch the height of the statue.

461
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:27,059
The higher it is, the more they need their desire.

462
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:27,559
Okay.

463
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,839
This scroll shows the impressiveness of your city.

464
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:35,480
Its population and happiness.

465
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,039
There is plenty of other useful information about your growing metropolis.

466
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,400
Refer to it often.

467
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,519
So that's the need.

468
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,559
That's how evil I am.

469
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:49,160
Hold your hand over the statues and leave it there to get more detail.

470
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,660
Alright, that's good.

471
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,319
So right now we're doing great.

472
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:55,779
Ohms.

473
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,400
Oh, this is so much better.

474
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh my god.

475
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,119
It's so much better.

476
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,319
Look at that.

477
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,400
If you get, it's wow.

478
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,319
They, what an improvement from the last game.

479
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:07,359
All right.

480
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,480
Why am I evil?

481
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,360
I didn't even do anything.

482
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,920
I'm 0.1% evil.

483
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,420
How?

484
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:13,760
I didn't do shit.

485
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:19,650
All right.

486
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,210
Let's keep going.

487
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,320
Your people desire houses.

488
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,880
Move your hand over the rotating building.

489
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,480
Then click and hold the action button to drag it off.

490
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:36,980
Wait, what?

491
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,300
We need the right buildings and food if we're going to support a powerful army.

492
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,900
So hold on.

493
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,460
This is how you make buildings now?

494
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,179
Click the action button again to place it down.

495
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:49,420
All right.

496
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,099
We got to, we got to put, I got to do this right because this is the first like actual mission.

497
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,099
Let's go back here.

498
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,099
That's right.

499
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,139
Keep going.

500
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,059
We can speed it up by picking up a tree and dropping it on the building.

501
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,630
How much wood does it need?

502
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,590
Your villagers will use that to build the house with.

503
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,550
Did I lost the tutorial?

504
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,670
No, this is the real game.

505
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,429
The tutorial, we were on tutorial island.

506
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:19,860
Now how much do you need?

507
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:22,099
320 wood, what do I have here?

508
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,500
609 wood, what the fuck?

509
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,659
I need a builder, right?

510
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,679
Come here.

511
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,239
You.

512
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:31,739
Builder.

513
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:34,980
Disciple builder.

514
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,619
He's going to corrupt the save again.

515
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,920
What?

516
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,300
Place 11 foundations.

517
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,139
Are you serious?

518
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,280
Oh, I got to place 11 houses?

519
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,719
That's a lot of houses.

520
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,239
Keep going.

521
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:07,000
How much, how much wood do I need?

522
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,250
Subtitles are riot.

523
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,329
What do you need subtitles for?

524
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:17,449
How do I rotate?

525
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:19,690
Is there like an altar?

526
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,570
How do I rotate?

527
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,210
R?

528
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,429
Middle mouse?

529
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:24,230
Right mouse?

530
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,030
How do I rotate?

531
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:31,829
I can't rotate.

532
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:33,269
Tell me how to rotate.

533
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,510
The house is finished.

534
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,150
Tell me how to rotate.

535
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,630
And look how delighted the villagers are.

536
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,369
Oh, okay, good.

537
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,500
You can also drag a building blueprint off an existing house.

538
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:50,820
Really?

539
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,619
Move your hand over the existing house.

540
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:57,699
Hold down the action button and drag to get the blueprint.

541
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:00,980
If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand,

542
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,219
simply shake it briskly left and right.

543
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:14,730
We need to have, these laws have to be good.

544
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,269
Photoshop.

545
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:23,429
That's not even accurate.

546
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:24,630
Why did you say that?

547
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,710
I'm, I'm, I can't.

548
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,349
Why?

549
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:32,090
It can also help to build buildings yourself.

550
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,289
Come on, I want to learn.

551
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:34,969
This is God building.

552
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:37,769
Yes, you do it by picking up resources the building needs.

553
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,210
What can sign in the way?

554
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,610
Then hold your hand over the building

555
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,250
and press and hold the action button.

556
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,250
This is very useful,

557
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,849
but you do lose some of the resource in the process.

558
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:50,650
So wait, I can build?

559
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,050
Make two disciple builders.

560
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,769
We can also create some disciple builders

561
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:57,849
to help with our city building.

562
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:59,289
Just drop a villager by house.

563
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:00,409
Then you drop them down by a house.

564
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:01,449
It's under construction to create one.

565
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:02,650
Hold the action button.

566
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,650
Make three disciple builders.

567
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:08,969
Okay, hold on.

568
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,449
Why am I using ray key to try to build a house?

569
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:14,409
That's not how this works.

570
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:18,519
What do I have to do with the tree in my hand?

571
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,000
Keep going.

572
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,110
Or drop the person by a building site.

573
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,030
I need four more foundations.

574
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:31,190
Wait, this is facing the wrong way.

575
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:38,420
Okay, well, all right.

576
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,099
We're going to expand this way anyways.

577
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:47,349
Let's go over here.

578
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:50,869
We'll have like the one community, one community.

579
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,789
Three more foundations.

580
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:58,809
You need to create a disciple builder.

581
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:13,480
This town sucks.

582
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,519
This wasn't even in the last game.

583
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:25,559
This will be the expensive house that's back here.

584
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,760
You need to create a disciple builder.

585
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,559
I know, hold on.

586
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:38,780
Excellent.

587
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,860
We've got a nice little troop of builders.

588
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,949
Can I get rid of the sign?

589
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,059
It's blocking me.

590
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:47,099
Fields within roads.

591
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,300
You may lay out roads.

592
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,940
You can fill inside them with a field by dragging out.

593
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,340
The field will make the road as its boundary.

594
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:55,829
What?

595
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:07,929
If you lay out roads, how do I lay out a road?

596
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,679
I didn't do that part yet.

597
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,639
That's not in the tutorial.

598
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,800
Drag from the road.

599
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:29,429
Oh, shit.

600
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,110
You can make roads in this one.

601
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:32,309
So we have to...

602
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:40,019
All right.

603
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,880
Should I go from here and just like this?

604
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,469
No, this is a bad road.

605
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:50,789
That's not right.

606
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:51,269
That's not right.

607
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,340
Building snap to the roads.

608
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,059
Oh, fuck.

609
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:55,699
This is wrong.

610
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:03,780
Oh, this is really bad because now these will never be on a road

611
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,900
unless I go in the middle here.

612
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,380
All right, here we go.

613
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,619
Ready?

614
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:13,820
Can I move the houses?

615
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:17,900
No, no, no, no.

616
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,940
That's making another house.

617
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:54,500
I didn't know this was possible.

618
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,780
Come on, give me a break.

619
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,400
That's all right.

620
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,960
It's okay.

621
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,280
Whatever.

622
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,079
It's the first level.

623
00:41:59,079 --> 00:41:59,559
Who cares?

624
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,539
This is the problem, though.

625
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:03,699
All right.

626
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:04,900
So we need to go from here to here.

627
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:20,010
I can't go like...

628
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,670
What some roads are like this.

629
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,389
What am I supposed to do?

630
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,150
Delete them all?

631
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:45,699
Yes.

632
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:46,179
It was done.

633
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,139
It was done with a crayon by a five-year-old,

634
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:50,900
but I didn't know you could even do this shit.

635
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:52,260
That's fine.

636
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,820
It's fine.

637
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,219
It's fine.

638
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:53,699
It works.

639
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,230
Let's connect these.

640
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,909
But I'm gonna need to construct five villas.

641
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:00,710
Hold on.

642
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:05,269
Let's go out to here and then we're gonna...

643
00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:05,510
Oh, fuck.

644
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,630
This is so wrong.

645
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:08,309
If I had known that roads existed,

646
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:09,349
I would have done this differently.

647
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:10,070
All right.

648
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,349
We're just gonna bucket.

649
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:12,070
This is the first level.

650
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:22,460
Ooh, it's the first level.

651
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,420
It doesn't matter.

652
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,369
All right.

653
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,210
Now I need to make five villas.

654
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:30,389
I have enough builders, right?

655
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:32,469
What do people need?

656
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,760
Free time.

657
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,590
Throw a villager.

658
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,590
No, I'm not throwing a villager right now.

659
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,090
Did you know?

660
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,610
With a villager in hand,

661
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,289
keep the hand still to get detailed information

662
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:52,409
about the person you're holding.

663
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,400
I need to make villas.

664
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,559
Uh, I was too busy looking at the roads.

665
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:00,679
What do I have to do for a villa?

666
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,469
Adult population, 34.

667
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:07,190
We need some...

668
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,230
We have a high brick road.

669
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,630
Good.

670
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,469
You've built enough houses for now.

671
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:11,670
Oh, that's a house as a villa.

672
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,710
We must get the people to multiply.

673
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,510
Oh, dear.

674
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,869
It's embarrassing talking.

675
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:17,590
Nowhere it ain't.

676
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,150
Where's the cow?

677
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,550
He's talking about breeding.

678
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,989
Breeding, boss.

679
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,190
You hear me, goody?

680
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,150
Just over here, fart sleeping.

681
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,510
We need three breeder disciples

682
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,909
to satisfy the village's needs.

683
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:30,150
Drop a man or woman from your hand

684
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,949
next to one of the opposite sex.

685
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:35,670
Disciple breeders will continue forever.

686
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,230
All right, you and you.

687
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,269
Excellent.

688
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:42,789
We need two more to satisfy the village's needs.

689
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,210
We need a breeder, breeder, breeder, breeder,

690
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,610
builder, builder, breeder, breed.

691
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,170
Oh, you are a breeder.

692
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,670
Okay.

693
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:56,969
Oh, we need...

694
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,730
All right, we got a male here.

695
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:00,840
Uh, you.

696
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,039
And you stop what you're doing?

697
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:05,400
Marvelous.

698
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,039
Do that instead.

699
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:08,039
You've now created enough breeders.

700
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,639
Any disciple will carry on doing that one job forever

701
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:13,559
unless you give them another job.

702
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:14,840
They want free time?

703
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,400
Do they have...

704
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,440
No, breeding...

705
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,480
No, they want free time.

706
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,760
They want to breed and they want to sleep.

707
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,599
Well, I just built the houses, so...

708
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,190
Forever, forever sex.

709
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:28,980
Sort of.

710
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,190
All right, now...

711
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,989
I'm gonna get some breeding here.

712
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,989
What we need to do is increase our population.

713
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:38,550
That's what we're doing.

714
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,989
Now we've got some breeders.

715
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:42,710
It should be easy to get 75 villages.

716
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,829
Increase population by 41.

717
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:46,309
All right, hold on.

718
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:47,110
What is this?

719
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,550
Ore desire?

720
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,980
This is ore right...

721
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,619
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

722
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:52,260
We need some...

723
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,820
This is new.

724
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:54,820
Builder.

725
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:56,760
Mine worker.

726
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:00,650
This is a new resource.

727
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:09,989
Click the gold scroll when you are ready to learn about the toolbar.

728
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:11,829
Hold on.

729
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:12,230
Wait, wait, wait.

730
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,590
I gotta get some people working in the mines.

731
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,590
Too young to be a...

732
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,869
What?

733
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,900
Who is it?

734
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,760
Karen Segal James.

735
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,559
Happiness.

736
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:29,079
Minus 0.84.

737
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:29,719
Depressed.

738
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:30,599
Health 100.

739
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:30,920
Breed.

740
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,059
Okay, well...

741
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:33,539
Whatever.

742
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:40,570
Right, let's open the toolbar.

743
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,050
See?

744
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,690
There is a flag at the bottom left of the screen.

745
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,010
Toolbar.

746
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:48,650
All you need to do to open it is click the action button on it once.

747
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,570
Okay, that's kind of in a weird spot.

748
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,849
It's like all the way down here.

749
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,300
Hey, what's that?

750
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,739
That is the toolbar.

751
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,019
There's gotta be a hotkey for this, right?

752
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:58,900
Good.

753
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,980
Now click again to close it.

754
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,139
There's gotta be a hotbar for this.

755
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,179
F1.

756
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,699
Oh, yeah.

757
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:08,730
That's much better.

758
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,610
So this is awesome.

759
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,090
So much easier.

760
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:16,010
These tabs are used to navigate the different menus.

761
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:19,530
The tab currently selected is the construction tab.

762
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,809
So the menu shown is the construction menu.

763
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:25,849
Each menu is divided into submenus.

764
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:30,010
We are going to show you how to access some advanced features.

765
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:32,090
Advanced, boys and girls.

766
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,929
Bring up the tribute menu.

767
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:35,130
Tribute menu, F4.

768
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,889
This is the coolest part of the menu.

769
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:39,849
Torture pit?

770
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:42,250
The tribute is like a form of currency.

771
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,449
Why is that the first thing there?

772
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:47,050
You can spend it on whatever you like, including new buildings.

773
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,289
You can improve your godly powers.

774
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,889
And add constructions or features to your town.

775
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:56,010
You earn tribute by finishing challenges

776
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,650
and doing other impressive things.

777
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,289
We have plenty of tribute at the moment.

778
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:03,210
Enough to buy a temple.

779
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,070
So the faithful will flock to this edifice erected in your glory.

780
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,429
Their earnest worship will be amplified in this holy place.

781
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:14,630
And not only will your people be happier,

782
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,030
but your entire town will be much more enhanced and impressiveness.

783
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,719
Okay, let's get it.

784
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:24,739
There it is.

785
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:27,139
You can now build a temple.

786
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:30,099
This is a good thing with a capital G.

787
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,019
Your town's impressiveness will increase.

788
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:37,219
Select the temple from the construction menu.

789
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,380
Then place it down in your town.

790
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,179
Torture pit.

791
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,860
But why would I?

792
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,219
I'm like afraid to do that.

793
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,739
All right.

794
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:45,860
Oh, this is huge.

795
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,099
All right.

796
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:46,739
We're going to put this...

797
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,280
That's not a bad spot for it.

798
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,400
Or should we have this for...

799
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,559
This is like our real estate community.

800
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,639
This would be our business section over here.

801
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:55,880
Right?

802
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,920
Like down here?

803
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,590
No, these are going to be houses over here.

804
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:06,539
I think like right here.

805
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:08,940
No, it's going to be connected to a road behind here.

806
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,929
The torture pit is going to go down here.

807
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:12,570
So it's all right.

808
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:17,670
I'm thinking like right here.

809
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,079
Select the temple from the construction menu.

810
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:25,239
Then place it down in your town.

811
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:25,639
Right here.

812
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:26,360
Right in the edge.

813
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,239
Some buildings require all to be built.

814
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:31,639
There are two sources of all.

815
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:36,519
The first is the ore mine and ore deposit in the ground

816
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:38,840
that can be mined by your villagers.

817
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,559
There are also all rocks.

818
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:44,599
The villagers can mine these but at the same time

819
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:46,920
you can add them to your storehouse yourself.

820
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,519
Oh, I just pick up the ore.

821
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,400
So they can't do this.

822
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:51,320
I can do this.

823
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:54,070
Here we go.

824
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,030
Ore is over here.

825
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:56,230
Boom.

826
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:57,909
Oh, boom.

827
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,530
I got to be careful I don't hit anybody with this.

828
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,489
I don't want to hit anybody with this.

829
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,099
Let's just pick them all up.

830
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:07,139
Get it over with and done.

831
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:10,900
And then conquer whatever we need to conquer.

832
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,780
Oh wait, 22.

833
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,579
All right, temple.

834
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:13,539
Temple's not built yet.

835
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:15,699
It's time for the torture pit.

836
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,219
No, I'm not a fucking monster.

837
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:22,219
That's not the second building I'm going to build.

838
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,090
Oh, right.

839
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:40,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

840
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:40,969
Okay.

841
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:41,449
I got it.

842
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:41,769
I got it.

843
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:42,090
I got it.

844
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:42,570
I got it.

845
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:53,130
Builder.

846
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:53,690
You.

847
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,199
Who are you?

848
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:56,599
You build.

849
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,840
I'll help.

850
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,300
You coming over here too?

851
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,099
You're going to help build?

852
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:09,530
No.

853
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:10,730
Why are you just following this person?

854
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:10,969
Okay.

855
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,539
Why have I run out of trees?

856
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:23,480
They need to breed.

857
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,719
My population's doing fine.

858
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:26,760
15, 14.

859
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,960
We're almost done.

860
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:36,179
Is that it?

861
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,920
Why am I holding like a dead tree?

862
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:48,300
Oh, I think I'm outside of the ring.

863
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:48,699
Wait, what?

864
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,289
What are you talking about?

865
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,539
I'm inside the ring.

866
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,880
Oh, it needs ore.

867
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,300
Oh, okay.

868
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:10,519
Oh, come here.

869
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:14,570
1,200 ore.

870
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,530
1,000 ore.

871
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:15,929
What?

872
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:16,570
Come on.

873
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,130
Is this ore?

874
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:23,030
What are you doing?

875
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:29,130
300 ore.

876
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,090
Almost there.

877
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:30,809
Where's the cow?

878
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:32,250
Resting.

879
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:34,730
Because the cow is not doing...

880
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,849
The cow can't do anything yet.

881
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:37,960
But we'll check in.

882
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:39,690
It's still sleeping.

883
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,809
It's been like seven days.

884
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:48,329
What a lazy bastard.

885
00:52:48,329 --> 00:52:50,409
No, he's a baby.

886
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:56,260
And plus, wait, it's a cow.

887
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:02,340
It's a she.

888
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:04,650
It's a cow.

889
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:13,159
Cow, it's a cow.

890
00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:35,400
How do people get so many channel points?

891
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,559
If you subscribe, you get double.

892
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:39,989
All right, we got the temple now.

893
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:40,949
We're very impressive.

894
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:44,550
Oops, I just dropped a rock on it.

895
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,630
I just smashed a window accidentally.

896
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,429
It says, is it okay?

897
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,059
All right, impressiveness went up.

898
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,269
I need one more population.

899
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,429
Very impressive city.

900
00:53:57,429 --> 00:54:01,829
Then people will come from far and wide to live in it.

901
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:05,909
Civic buildings are a good way to increase impressiveness.

902
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:11,670
Nobody gets hurt and we get more followers making us more powerful.

903
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,460
Why'd you build the temple on an incline?

904
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,380
Look, those people are migrating.

905
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,699
They want to live in our town.

906
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:21,260
They're bringing all their worldly goods.

907
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:21,760
Hooray!

908
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:26,139
People of all tribes will be drawn from far and wide.

909
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:26,619
Here they come.

910
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:28,380
To live in a good city.

911
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,139
Come on, it's time to do something.

912
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:34,440
Here they come.

913
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,820
They're coming because they want to see the impressive city.

914
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,539
Come on over.

915
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:43,820
Take a look.

916
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,420
Have you seen the cow?

917
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,840
Take a look at the cow.

918
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,599
All right, it's time to do some work.

919
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:51,880
You got to go.

920
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,880
They'll make people laugh and stuff.

921
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:59,780
Let's not disturb him.

922
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:04,170
I can't even wait.

923
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:08,460
All right, I'm just waiting for them to come in.

924
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:14,710
All right, who's this?

925
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:17,619
What are these people doing?

926
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,739
I don't like the look of those fellows.

927
00:55:20,739 --> 00:55:22,340
Why, they have swords?

928
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:28,920
Where are they going?

929
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,639
I can't grab them.

930
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:33,219
This is an RTS.

931
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:34,420
This person has patrols.

932
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:34,920
Okay.

933
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,510
Look at that town.

934
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,349
It's not dissimilar from ours.

935
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:41,340
Hi, guys.

936
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:46,300
All right, are they almost here?

937
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,019
Let's welcome them.

938
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:52,500
Let's welcome them by immediately grabbing the person with the flag

939
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,780
and throwing them as far as we can.

940
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:59,130
I don't like that, though.

941
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,050
They're going to come over here and kill us.

942
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:04,179
All right, anybody who's at the temple?

943
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:04,679
Anybody?

944
00:56:05,139 --> 00:56:06,250
No worshipers?

945
00:56:06,969 --> 00:56:09,590
Here, use it.

946
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:11,690
Do you worship at that building?

947
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:15,460
Oh, here they come.

948
00:56:18,699 --> 00:56:21,739
These people have come to join our town.

949
00:56:21,739 --> 00:56:27,019
Pick up their migration flag and drop it anywhere within our influence ring.

950
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,980
Wait, they have a migration flag?

951
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:31,599
Okay.

952
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:34,829
18,000.

953
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,179
Torture pit, torture pit, torture pit.

954
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:43,139
Oh, God.

955
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:43,940
All right, hold on.

956
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,539
Look at how many people are here now.

957
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:48,420
This is Breeder.

958
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,380
This is...

959
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:52,920
Wait, before anybody does anything.

960
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:00,019
Let's get some more people.

961
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:01,139
I need some workers.

962
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,000
All right, let's go.

963
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,039
How many people are in this field?

964
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,280
Zero to 17.

965
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:06,599
Hold on.

966
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:07,639
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

967
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,820
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

968
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,019
I know you just came in, but here.

969
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:14,159
Let's go.

970
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:18,039
I need more.

971
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,780
I need more buildings.

972
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:27,159
Okay, wait.

973
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:27,659
Breeder.

974
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,760
We want Breeder again.

975
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:33,909
We want Farmer.

976
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:35,989
What are the needs?

977
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,030
I'm looking.

978
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,510
I'm a good guy.

979
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:39,269
4.9% good.

980
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:40,869
Pick on the gold scroll.

981
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,079
Armories are where you can turn your people into warriors.

982
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:50,360
Really?

983
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:50,860
Holy shit.

984
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,199
Warriors who can take other towns and lands by force.

985
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:58,519
Buying the armory is the first step towards having an army.

986
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,880
Open the toolbar and click the tribute tab.

987
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,340
Armory.

988
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,000
Why build that when you can build an armory?

989
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:13,340
Why build the temple when you could build an armory?

990
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:16,679
It's burning.

991
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,900
It's just that every voice is burning, isn't it?

992
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:25,059
Recruit powerful armies made up of strong brave swordsmen.

993
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:27,619
Almost scarily eager to do battle in your name against your enemies.

994
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:29,869
Let's get it.

995
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:34,670
Select the armory from the construction menu.

996
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:37,150
Then place it down in your town.

997
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:41,230
All right, where should I put this?

998
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:44,039
How about over here?

999
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,960
Where's the nearest town?

1000
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:47,280
Down?

1001
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,960
All right, I want it down here.

1002
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,199
Somewhere like over here on the edge.

1003
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:54,800
Where's the entrance?

1004
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,239
Right there?

1005
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:57,360
Okay, so we're going to go like this.

1006
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,880
We're going to have a road eventually connect here.

1007
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,420
Right there.

1008
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,119
Let's get some roads.

1009
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,650
How about like this?

1010
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,929
Split around the farm.

1011
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:10,889
That looks nice.

1012
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:12,090
Oh, that looks nice.

1013
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:16,139
Oh, this way over here.

1014
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,760
Oh, look, that looks nice.

1015
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,000
Then from here, we're going to go this way.

1016
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:32,519
God sucks at design.

1017
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:34,280
Why am I evil for doing this?

1018
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:38,889
Oh, because I'm building an evil building.

1019
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:41,079
I get it.

1020
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:42,920
It's an evil building.

1021
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:00,860
Go.

1022
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,500
Evil.

1023
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,880
How much does it need?

1024
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,369
810 wood, 500 ore.

1025
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:10,039
Uneven.

1026
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,079
Doesn't need to be even.

1027
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:15,630
Marius, when are you going to wake up?

1028
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,309
I want to play fun games with you.

1029
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,789
Like kick the tree.

1030
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,000
Do you remember kick the tree?

1031
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,300
You love that game, Marius.

1032
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,260
All right, let's get some ore.

1033
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,280
No, that's not right.

1034
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,920
The green ring you see is the extent of your influence.

1035
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,480
Oh, shit.

1036
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,760
I need miners.

1037
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,230
How much ore do I have?

1038
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:47,710
Is it?

1039
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:48,349
How much ore do I have?

1040
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:49,469
Let me go to my stockpile.

1041
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:51,070
I got a lot.

1042
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,670
How much do I get ore?

1043
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,030
I'm full on wood.

1044
01:00:54,909 --> 01:00:56,480
Wait.

1045
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,800
Okay, that's good.

1046
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,000
Gee, the people can be slow at building, boys.

1047
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We should do some god building.

1048
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,320
You know, they were speeding up.

1049
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,360
That is sweet.

1050
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,210
All right, now we can make warriors.

1051
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:16,489
They're recruited via the flags on the top of the armory.

1052
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:18,809
Pick up one of the flags on the armory.

1053
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:21,050
Then place it in the highlighted area.

1054
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:23,849
So I have to make war?

1055
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,170
Make platoons?

1056
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,250
Number of troops, number of melee.

1057
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,369
It's melee.

1058
01:01:29,369 --> 01:01:30,889
God, I know how to say that word.

1059
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:37,070
Oh, shit.

1060
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:37,230
Okay.

1061
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,829
Dropping the flag will make a standard size platoon.

1062
01:01:40,829 --> 01:01:44,510
To recruit a larger platoon, hold down the action button.

1063
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,670
Then drag away from the flag.

1064
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:50,110
You can make a huge army so you can just drag this gigantic area.

1065
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,670
Wait, why are you coming over here?

1066
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:53,630
I didn't tell you to come over here.

1067
01:01:55,309 --> 01:01:57,789
Boy, too many people want to be warriors.

1068
01:01:57,789 --> 01:02:00,829
Wait, don't I have to tell you to be a warrior?

1069
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:03,309
All right, are you sure you guys don't want to be farmers?

1070
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:09,530
Oh, God.

1071
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:09,849
Okay.

1072
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,820
I can't click it.

1073
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,280
Where are they going?

1074
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,250
These are the best thing ever.

1075
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,889
But you're going to need to keep them under control.

1076
01:02:24,889 --> 01:02:28,889
So you need to know all about these here flags.

1077
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:30,969
Every platoon has a flag.

1078
01:02:30,969 --> 01:02:33,690
You can see it held up high above the army.

1079
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,889
And also in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.

1080
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,010
This is an armory tab.

1081
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:41,369
Each platoon type has a different color and symbol on their flag.

1082
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:43,690
To make them easy to identify.

1083
01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:46,170
This one is a swordsman platoon.

1084
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,769
The flags also tell you what rank the platoon is.

1085
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:55,849
Those pips along the top indicate the rank from raw recruits to seasoned veterans.

1086
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:59,769
If you click on the flags in the bottom right with the action button,

1087
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:03,210
you pick up the flag and gain control of the platoon.

1088
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:03,610
Okay.

1089
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:08,329
Click on the flag with the move button and you'll go directly to the platoon.

1090
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:09,849
And there you have it.

1091
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:12,250
The basics of army flags.

1092
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,050
Pick up the platoon flag, boys.

1093
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:17,449
Pick up the platoon flag.

1094
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:19,530
Health 120 to 20.

1095
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:24,639
That's kind of in a weird spot for a platoon here.

1096
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,400
Let's go.

1097
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,000
That's perfect.

1098
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,440
Click on the highlighted area to tell them to go there.

1099
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,800
If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand,

1100
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,039
simply shake his brisket left and right.

1101
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,800
So I don't have to have influence over here.

1102
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:42,480
That's kind of a big deal.

1103
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:52,920
I don't have to have influence?

1104
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,639
So I can just make a ton of people and just go conquer towns.

1105
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,570
They just go where I can't.

1106
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,800
That's so awesome.

1107
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,559
Actually having control over what they do.

1108
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:13,800
Because remember last time it was if you were outside,

1109
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,679
it was like I had to throw people to gain access to be able.

1110
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:19,500
It was that's a much needed change.

1111
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,679
I had to throw that one unkillable guy around the map.

1112
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:38,300
Do I want to do this by force?

1113
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,820
I guess it's just teaching me how this works.

1114
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,880
All right, where are we going?

1115
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:47,440
Didn't these people all just come over willingly?

1116
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,960
Everyone just came over here.

1117
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,880
This is an empty town.

1118
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:03,800
They're coming?

1119
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:08,480
Raise it to the ground.

1120
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,440
There's nothing to raise.

1121
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,159
It's just a few houses in a temple.

1122
01:05:25,179 --> 01:05:26,380
They eat twice the food?

1123
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,690
Oh god, here they come.

1124
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:43,929
How do I put the flag down like that?

1125
01:05:43,929 --> 01:05:46,079
All right guys, do what you do.

1126
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,400
Diplomacy first, always.

1127
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:03,840
Well, we're already doing this.

1128
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,670
Take over town by impressing what?

1129
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,789
Impressing the stones?

1130
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:19,050
Impress them with how many soldiers you have.

1131
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:25,400
I mean, that works, I guess.

1132
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:28,539
How are we doing?

1133
01:06:28,539 --> 01:06:29,340
Do we need anything?

1134
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:33,599
Homes?

1135
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:36,349
We need some houses.

1136
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:38,030
Okay, we're going to get some houses.

1137
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,050
We need some villa.

1138
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,840
I know this is terrible.

1139
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,800
It sucks, but who cares?

1140
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,239
We're going to do two more.

1141
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:53,360
I know it's terrible.

1142
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,480
I know, trust me.

1143
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,199
I'm the one making it.

1144
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:56,559
You don't think I know it's horrible?

1145
01:06:57,199 --> 01:06:59,400
We'll do like three more houses.

1146
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:05,139
That's fine.

1147
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:07,760
Do they get it?

1148
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:19,920
Dermot the bomb.

1149
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,280
Dermot, he has earpods in.

1150
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,760
Oh shit, I can't hear you.

1151
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:27,739
And so what?

1152
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:29,500
Do I just gain influence?

1153
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:34,519
I can't hear it.

1154
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:36,840
Impressiveness required to capture.

1155
01:07:39,849 --> 01:07:41,530
There's 19 people still here.

1156
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,090
That's weird.

1157
01:07:42,889 --> 01:07:49,400
Oh, and there we go.

1158
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:49,900
We got it.

1159
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,519
Hooray.

1160
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,940
Now where are they going?

1161
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,539
More followers for our glorious war machine.

1162
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:02,860
Yeah, now you own this town.

1163
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,980
You can do anything in the great influence ring,

1164
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,420
just like in your town.

1165
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,219
That's what I need.

1166
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:10,539
Attack is the best form of defense.

1167
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:12,300
Get your armies out there.

1168
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,019
I adore it.

1169
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:17,020
A newly created platoon starts at experience level one.

1170
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,979
Unless they fight, they gain experience.

1171
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:23,659
When the platoon's experience reaches a certain threshold,

1172
01:08:23,659 --> 01:08:25,899
they go up to the next experience level

1173
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:30,460
and with it, their skills such as fighting and speed improve.

1174
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:34,539
Lastly, if you want to disband the platoon,

1175
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:37,420
drop the platoon's flag onto an armory

1176
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,340
and let those weaklings off the hook.

1177
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:40,380
Oh, that.

1178
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,939
OK, so they can go back to being regular.

1179
01:08:42,939 --> 01:08:43,439
OK.

1180
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:49,640
You see, you can win by taking over towns using force

1181
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,920
or by impressing the people in those other towns.

1182
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,800
Need a builder over here.

1183
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,640
War solves everything.

1184
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,760
How many of you guys are farmers?

1185
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,260
Build.

1186
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:00,840
You can win by a mixture of impressing and war.

1187
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,560
They're all breeders.

1188
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:06,359
Alas, the time of innocence draws to a close.

1189
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:09,399
You must take a step down the road of good.

1190
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:16,250
And by the way, war is evil and I'm evil.

1191
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:18,090
You get where I'm coming from.

1192
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,609
Time to choose, boys.

1193
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:20,409
Time to choose?

1194
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:24,010
Take over every town on the land.

1195
01:09:27,369 --> 01:09:28,090
Oh, shit.

1196
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:29,210
I got to take these two over.

1197
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:34,779
Be good.

1198
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:35,260
Be evil.

1199
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:35,659
Be good.

1200
01:09:35,659 --> 01:09:36,140
Be evil.

1201
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:36,699
Be evil.

1202
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,100
Um, well, hold on.

1203
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:44,220
Oh, it's time to awaken.

1204
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:46,939
It's time to, but not yet.

1205
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:47,340
Not yet.

1206
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:47,819
Not yet.

1207
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:49,979
Let's let the fucking hype build a little more.

1208
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:55,930
Another important part of the toolbar is the objectives menu.

1209
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,729
Select the objectives tab to open it.

1210
01:09:58,729 --> 01:09:59,920
F2?

1211
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:01,920
F1?

1212
01:10:02,779 --> 01:10:03,420
It's not F2.

1213
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:03,819
What is it?

1214
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,489
Objectives tab?

1215
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,229
Right.

1216
01:10:09,229 --> 01:10:12,029
Here you can find all the important tasks

1217
01:10:12,029 --> 01:10:14,189
that will enable you to complete a land.

1218
01:10:14,189 --> 01:10:17,470
And also some less important tasks that are just interesting.

1219
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:18,590
We're almost there.

1220
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,750
The tabs at the bottom right control which objectives you are looking at.

1221
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,310
Oh, that's cool.

1222
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:26,029
Either all of them or a selection from the total.

1223
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:30,750
The objectives window up in the top left also displays the objectives.

1224
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,989
You only need to complete the gold scroll objective to complete the land.

1225
01:10:34,989 --> 01:10:35,229
Okay.

1226
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:39,310
But you earn more tribute by undertaking some of the other ones.

1227
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:39,630
Yeah.

1228
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:40,270
Yes.

1229
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,630
You earn tribute for every objective you complete.

1230
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:44,590
Oh, the side quest?

1231
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,630
They call it the gold scroll.

1232
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,550
I'm not clicking on...

1233
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:48,350
No, I don't want to do that yet.

1234
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,470
There's like this...

1235
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:50,029
All this stuff.

1236
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,159
All right.

1237
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,800
That's good to know.

1238
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,720
As our city grows, the greater the distance our villagers will have to travel.

1239
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,479
To aid their little feet, we can build roads.

1240
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:08,159
To build a road, grab an existing road by holding down the action button.

1241
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:11,199
Then drag out the shape of the road you want.

1242
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,920
When you are happy with it, click the action button.

1243
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,000
So you got to build roads first.

1244
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,560
And then you block out the town.

1245
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:18,960
Yeah.

1246
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,279
Okay.

1247
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,600
Have a go at building a road.

1248
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:21,920
All right.

1249
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,239
All right.

1250
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,199
Well, I need to have...

1251
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,000
We'll just have this connected here because it's tutorial.

1252
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,520
Whatever.

1253
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,239
Who cares?

1254
01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:39,840
Doesn't matter.

1255
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,960
I had to do that just to keep...

1256
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,640
Oh, that looks really bad.

1257
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:46,479
From a satellite, that looks really bad.

1258
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:47,600
It doesn't matter.

1259
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,560
This is level one.

1260
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,319
We'll block out the next complete village.

1261
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:52,479
We haven't even woken up the creature yet, so we're good.

1262
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:55,000
All right.

1263
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,039
What's this side quest?

1264
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:02,000
What does it do?

1265
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,279
Drunk city builder.

1266
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:08,319
Hey, you!

1267
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:09,600
Great God!

1268
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,079
If you exist, I know you can hear me.

1269
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:14,399
My daughter's fallen pregnant.

1270
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:16,479
She says no man has touched her.

1271
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:18,560
It's an immaculate conception.

1272
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,720
So it must be down to you.

1273
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,199
You are responsible for the child.

1274
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,000
Pay me a dowry of 1,000 wood.

1275
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,119
I have no idea how this happened.

1276
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:35,340
How does she get pregnant?

1277
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,500
She's having sex to my left.

1278
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,180
Whoever is responsible and clear your good name.

1279
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:43,260
Something is amiss here, lead out.

1280
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:43,899
That was ridiculous.

1281
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:45,899
Maybe you should see where she's going.

1282
01:12:46,939 --> 01:12:52,329
Where is she going?

1283
01:12:54,729 --> 01:12:55,930
Something is amiss?

1284
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:07,239
What are we doing?

1285
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,770
Clean up those ants.

1286
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:12,649
There's bugs everywhere.

1287
01:13:13,449 --> 01:13:14,810
Who left out like a can of food?

1288
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:15,210
Come on.

1289
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:32,039
I don't know.

1290
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:34,199
I don't know if that was scripted enough, but that was fucking funny.

1291
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:36,909
Who's playing the automaton?

1292
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:40,880
All right.

1293
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,119
How?

1294
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,899
Watch out.

1295
01:13:43,899 --> 01:13:44,619
The person has an axe.

1296
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,640
Click on the gold scroll.

1297
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:49,720
No, I'm busy.

1298
01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:56,329
New follow quest.

1299
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:57,529
I don't care if this is two hours.

1300
01:13:58,409 --> 01:14:03,520
At least I don't have to be behind her.

1301
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,869
Where are you going?

1302
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:09,229
All the way?

1303
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:11,789
Are you walking all the way to one of these houses?

1304
01:14:11,789 --> 01:14:12,029
Okay.

1305
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:28,079
Oh my God.

1306
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:29,199
What?

1307
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,840
She's going right over here.

1308
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:50,800
Why do I feel like one of these random townspeople is going to just throw something at her?

1309
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,840
Or like a attacker or something.

1310
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,359
They keep walking over here menacingly.

1311
01:14:55,289 --> 01:14:56,090
Where are you going?

1312
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:01,449
I don't know why there's so many bugs.

1313
01:15:01,449 --> 01:15:01,930
I don't know.

1314
01:15:02,729 --> 01:15:06,199
Here we go.

1315
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,770
It's because the houses were so far away.

1316
01:15:10,569 --> 01:15:12,170
This is the home of the community.

1317
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:16,029
You had to walk across the whole town pregnant.

1318
01:15:16,829 --> 01:15:19,850
This is like scale it back.

1319
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,210
This is like probably 10 miles.

1320
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:26,859
This is like at least four to five miles is scaled.

1321
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:31,149
Okay.

1322
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:34,970
So now what?

1323
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:44,600
Is she going to be like you're the dad or something?

1324
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,560
Hello handsome.

1325
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,420
I know something was going on.

1326
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,399
No such thing.

1327
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:51,560
What?

1328
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,880
Someone ought to let her father know about this.

1329
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,640
I don't understand.

1330
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,079
Hold on.

1331
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,680
She's like she's pregnant.

1332
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:09,310
How is she?

1333
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:09,630
Okay.

1334
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:14,670
She's having she's having sex while like nine months pregnant?

1335
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:17,739
What?

1336
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,939
Wait, what the fuck?

1337
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:25,130
Where's the okay?

1338
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:26,329
Where is this guy?

1339
01:16:26,329 --> 01:16:27,930
He was in the other community.

1340
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:31,279
What community was he in?

1341
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:31,680
This one?

1342
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,520
Uh hey.

1343
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:51,880
I got something for you.

1344
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:52,680
You?

1345
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,329
Hello?

1346
01:16:55,289 --> 01:16:55,930
Can I talk to you?

1347
01:16:57,609 --> 01:17:00,939
Uh I was gonna bring you over here.

1348
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:15,880
No come here.

1349
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:25,710
It took too long.

1350
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:25,949
What?

1351
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:31,819
No I didn't.

1352
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:39,340
He's already gone.

1353
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,810
You have to put him in the chimney.

1354
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:50,239
She's walking away?

1355
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,359
Oh shit.

1356
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:53,920
There she is.

1357
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:54,159
All right.

1358
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:54,479
Hold on.

1359
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:54,800
Wait, wait.

1360
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:05,609
No look.

1361
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:07,069
It's all right.

1362
01:18:07,069 --> 01:18:08,029
She'll do it again.

1363
01:18:08,029 --> 01:18:15,880
It's all right.

1364
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:16,920
She'll go back.

1365
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,170
It's all right.

1366
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:21,739
Oh we need ore.

1367
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,180
How many people are in the mine?

1368
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,239
Zero.

1369
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:25,479
What?

1370
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,430
Disciple mine worker.

1371
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:32,939
Disciple mine.

1372
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:33,579
Oh no, no, no.

1373
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:34,779
You you keep doing your thing.

1374
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:42,109
Disciple mine.

1375
01:18:42,109 --> 01:18:42,829
All right.

1376
01:18:42,829 --> 01:18:43,949
We'll go back to that quest.

1377
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,149
It's gonna happen.

1378
01:18:45,149 --> 01:18:47,069
Just remind me that it's happening and I will catch it.

1379
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,079
Click on the gold scroll.

1380
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:51,520
It's time to awaken Murius.

1381
01:18:52,159 --> 01:19:00,170
Creature's waking up.

1382
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:06,920
And it was a long sleep but here we are.

1383
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:14,680
Ah I'm over here.

1384
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:26,359
He's scared.

1385
01:19:26,359 --> 01:19:27,880
He doesn't want to leave the pen.

1386
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,479
Why are you scared?

1387
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:33,000
Let's use the leash to get him to move.

1388
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,319
Okay.

1389
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:37,479
To grab the leash click on the creature with the action button

1390
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:40,600
or you can just press the L key.

1391
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,319
Okay.

1392
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,000
Grab the creature's leash.

1393
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,279
Here we go.

1394
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:48,119
He's been in the pen for ages.

1395
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:50,680
Make him come outside for a bit.

1396
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:55,000
Move him outside by clicking the action button once on the ground.

1397
01:19:56,119 --> 01:19:57,079
Excellent.

1398
01:19:57,079 --> 01:20:01,720
With your creature on the leash you can move him or get him to do things.

1399
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,760
And more importantly to do what you want him to do.

1400
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,199
Oh my god.

1401
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:07,720
Why are you so slow?

1402
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,720
He slept like a hundred years?

1403
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:14,170
Well.

1404
01:20:15,579 --> 01:20:16,619
Well done.

1405
01:20:16,619 --> 01:20:19,020
That's how you get the creature to move.

1406
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,859
The creature's hungry.

1407
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:21,739
Let's feed him.

1408
01:20:22,779 --> 01:20:23,180
Okay.

1409
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:23,659
What do you want?

1410
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:25,260
Food?

1411
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:25,659
Grain?

1412
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:27,979
With the leash in the hand click on the field.

1413
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,520
Don't get grain.

1414
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:31,720
Here it comes.

1415
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:33,479
I'm going to get that grain.

1416
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:36,619
Yes.

1417
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:38,170
Eat it.

1418
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:39,689
It's delicious.

1419
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:42,359
That's better.

1420
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:44,520
He doesn't look as hungry now.

1421
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,960
When click the action button on something with the leash the creature will try.

1422
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,319
He ate the entire field?

1423
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:56,640
Double click the action button on that rock by the field and he will be leashed to it.

1424
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:00,270
That's right.

1425
01:21:00,909 --> 01:21:01,470
Marvelous.

1426
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:02,829
Does the leash actually work in this game?

1427
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:09,770
You should now teach your creature whether what he does is good or bad.

1428
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:11,050
Should I eat a villager?

1429
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:11,930
Oh dear.

1430
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:13,689
He's going to eat a villager.

1431
01:21:13,689 --> 01:21:16,170
You should teach him not to do that.

1432
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,529
Nonsense.

1433
01:21:17,529 --> 01:21:20,489
Eating villagers will make him strong.

1434
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:23,050
Click and hold the action button on him.

1435
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:27,930
Move the mouse quickly from side to side to punish him for eating that person.

1436
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,130
He didn't eat anybody yet.

1437
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:30,970
Move the mouse slowly.

1438
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:33,050
Pet him and reward him.

1439
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:35,529
Eating people is fine by me you see.

1440
01:21:35,529 --> 01:21:36,489
He didn't eat anybody.

1441
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,569
He has not eaten this person.

1442
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,810
So he hasn't done anything wrong.

1443
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,689
You haven't done anything wrong yet.

1444
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:45,130
Why would I discipline you?

1445
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:46,010
Just pick somebody up.

1446
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:48,000
All right.

1447
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,399
You're good.

1448
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:52,920
I'll sometimes choose to eat a villager.

1449
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,039
What do you mean sometimes?

1450
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,739
It's sensitive.

1451
01:21:59,739 --> 01:21:59,979
Wait.

1452
01:21:59,979 --> 01:22:01,180
I'll often choose.

1453
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:01,819
No, no, no, no.

1454
01:22:01,819 --> 01:22:03,739
Don't often choose to eat a villager.

1455
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:05,340
How do I?

1456
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:08,079
That was horrible.

1457
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,000
Oh my god.

1458
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,800
I knocked him down.

1459
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,270
What is he doing?

1460
01:22:16,989 --> 01:22:18,670
Oh my god.

1461
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:19,550
That's so bad.

1462
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:23,949
You're on the road to making a nasty creature.

1463
01:22:24,029 --> 01:22:26,670
What a senseless waste of human life.

1464
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:30,029
If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand,

1465
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:32,590
simply shake it briskly left and right.

1466
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:36,109
That is just about everything you need to know right now.

1467
01:22:36,109 --> 01:22:38,829
Why don't you try experimenting with your creature?

1468
01:22:39,949 --> 01:22:40,270
Okay.

1469
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:41,710
Let's experiment.

1470
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:42,670
What do you think is over here?

1471
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:43,470
Can you pick this up?

1472
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:44,590
Try.

1473
01:22:45,689 --> 01:22:46,890
I can't do that.

1474
01:22:53,789 --> 01:22:55,710
I'm going to eat snack on that grain.

1475
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:56,909
No, stop eating the grain.

1476
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,760
You eat too much grain.

1477
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:04,380
Oh my god.

1478
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,260
Can he eat bugs?

1479
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:06,560
Wait.

1480
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,039
Come over here.

1481
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:07,840
Eat the bugs.

1482
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,920
Can you play with the bugs or eat the bugs or something?

1483
01:23:11,869 --> 01:23:12,510
Wait.

1484
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:16,220
Pick up this rock.

1485
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,420
I have to teach you.

1486
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:22,680
Pick up rock.

1487
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:25,100
Okay.

1488
01:23:25,659 --> 01:23:25,899
Good.

1489
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,520
Very good.

1490
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:29,550
Do not eat rock.

1491
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,670
He's learning.

1492
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,590
He's getting inquisitive.

1493
01:23:35,239 --> 01:23:35,479
Okay.

1494
01:23:36,729 --> 01:23:38,409
Now you figure out what you want to do with it.

1495
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:42,649
Okay.

1496
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:43,210
Put it down.

1497
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,050
Very good.

1498
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:45,289
All right.

1499
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:45,850
What about the?

1500
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:52,840
I had enough for today.

1501
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:56,779
Okay.

1502
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,579
Well, that was a lot for one day.

1503
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,180
This is a rock.

1504
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:02,460
That's enough for one day.

1505
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,260
Food coma.

1506
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,500
All right.

1507
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,060
How are we doing?

1508
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,340
People want to sleep.

1509
01:24:11,979 --> 01:24:13,470
Do I not have enough houses?

1510
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,600
So let them sleep.

1511
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,720
All right.

1512
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,520
What about the daughter?

1513
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:25,069
There he is.

1514
01:24:25,789 --> 01:24:26,270
Where is she?

1515
01:24:27,069 --> 01:24:33,319
Because look for the pregnant lady going.

1516
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:36,079
Okay.

1517
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:36,880
We missed it.

1518
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,680
We got to do it again.

1519
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,159
Oh, he's up.

1520
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,640
Where are you going?

1521
01:24:48,439 --> 01:24:49,560
I want you to learn.

1522
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:50,600
I want you to do things.

1523
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,039
I want you to.

1524
01:24:52,039 --> 01:24:52,760
Why are you so?

1525
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,880
Why is his stomach so big?

1526
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:01,949
Just kind of doing a perimeter.

1527
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:06,119
Look at how fat the stomach is.

1528
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:12,430
Is he blowing a kiss?

1529
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,960
He's so wonderful.

1530
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,800
I could enter.

1531
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,159
I could entertain some villagers.

1532
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:18,399
Yeah.

1533
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:18,800
Do that.

1534
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,680
Entertain the villagers.

1535
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:31,199
How is this entertaining a villager?

1536
01:25:35,289 --> 01:25:36,729
He's like smelling them.

1537
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,170
I am going to play with that villager.

1538
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:40,649
Okay.

1539
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:41,130
Cool.

1540
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:45,100
You good work.

1541
01:25:47,979 --> 01:25:48,460
I did.

1542
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:49,100
I had fun.

1543
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:49,420
Bye.

1544
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,140
He just wanted to smell him.

1545
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:53,819
Bugs.

1546
01:25:53,819 --> 01:25:54,140
Yes.

1547
01:25:54,699 --> 01:25:55,180
Very good.

1548
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:01,039
Everybody loves him.

1549
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,479
Good job.

1550
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:05,130
Yeah.

1551
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:05,609
Very.

1552
01:26:05,609 --> 01:26:06,649
No, I'm trying to pet him.

1553
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:09,560
Good job.

1554
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,680
Entertain the villagers.

1555
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,180
All right.

1556
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:17,659
Let's do.

1557
01:26:17,659 --> 01:26:18,539
Now we have to take.

1558
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:18,859
All right.

1559
01:26:18,859 --> 01:26:19,819
He he'll be fine.

1560
01:26:19,819 --> 01:26:20,380
He's going to learn.

1561
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,750
I need more houses.

1562
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,710
Let's see.

1563
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:25,869
Right.

1564
01:26:25,869 --> 01:26:26,909
For creature.

1565
01:26:26,909 --> 01:26:28,699
I'm starving.

1566
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:28,939
Fuck.

1567
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:32,720
How much grain is here?

1568
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:36,270
All right.

1569
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:36,510
Here.

1570
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:37,069
Wait, wait, wait.

1571
01:26:38,029 --> 01:26:39,359
Take some of this.

1572
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:43,079
What are you doing over here?

1573
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,039
What are you doing?

1574
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:55,689
What is he?

1575
01:26:55,689 --> 01:26:56,729
Is he bringing this?

1576
01:26:56,729 --> 01:26:57,930
Where are you bringing this tree?

1577
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:11,439
So pointless.

1578
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:13,199
Wait, what are you going to eat this?

1579
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:13,760
No, no, no, no.

1580
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,720
Eat this instead.

1581
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:15,520
Eat that instead.

1582
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:16,960
No, no, no.

1583
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:17,840
Eat this instead.

1584
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,279
Hey, hey, leash, leash, leash, leash.

1585
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:19,680
Eat this.

1586
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:21,260
Eat the grain.

1587
01:27:23,899 --> 01:27:24,380
Eat that.

1588
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:28,239
No, no, no, no, no.

1589
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:28,720
Eat this.

1590
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:32,600
Why did he pick up the tree?

1591
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:36,359
He picked up the tree and gave the tree as a present

1592
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:37,319
to one of the villagers.

1593
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:38,439
Eat it.

1594
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:39,960
Eat that.

1595
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,079
Isn't it good?

1596
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:44,460
Yeah, it is.

1597
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,600
I'm going to...

1598
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,159
What does it say?

1599
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:49,880
I'm going to play with that villager.

1600
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:50,359
All right.

1601
01:27:50,359 --> 01:27:51,479
What do I do with this tree?

1602
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:52,439
Oh, somebody already picked it up.

1603
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:52,920
Okay, good.

1604
01:27:56,909 --> 01:27:58,109
ADHD cow.

1605
01:27:58,109 --> 01:27:58,430
Yeah.

1606
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:00,670
That's so much fun just to watch him grow.

1607
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:04,909
He wants to play with...

1608
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:09,630
This person's not interested at all.

1609
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:12,109
All right.

1610
01:28:13,149 --> 01:28:14,029
The pregnant lady.

1611
01:28:14,909 --> 01:28:15,310
There she goes.

1612
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:15,869
All right.

1613
01:28:15,869 --> 01:28:16,270
We're ready.

1614
01:28:17,579 --> 01:28:18,619
Now I'm going to...

1615
01:28:18,619 --> 01:28:19,180
Hold on.

1616
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:19,739
What do I need to do?

1617
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:20,300
I need to build...

1618
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:23,390
I need to build something else.

1619
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:26,810
Where's he going?

1620
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,319
Why is he picking up trees?

1621
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,399
Why is he doing this?

1622
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:33,000
What's the logic here?

1623
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,199
Is he trying to plant trees

1624
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:36,119
or he's giving trees to people?

1625
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:38,649
I'm going...

1626
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:40,649
I'm dead.

1627
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:40,890
What?

1628
01:28:41,689 --> 01:28:44,680
What is he doing?

1629
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:50,619
That's the wrong store.

1630
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:55,289
That's not...

1631
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:56,010
That's incorrect.

1632
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,460
I know he's trying to help, but...

1633
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,859
He's locked himself in here.

1634
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:05,949
That's not correct.

1635
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:06,270
All right.

1636
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,149
You tried though.

1637
01:29:07,149 --> 01:29:07,710
Good try.

1638
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,189
You tried.

1639
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:09,800
You tried.

1640
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:12,840
Nice work.

1641
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,560
Thank you for trying.

1642
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:18,199
He's just a baby.

1643
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:18,840
He doesn't know.

1644
01:29:24,619 --> 01:29:25,739
He didn't eat anybody.

1645
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:30,960
Okay.

1646
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:33,390
What was I doing?

1647
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,189
I'm too distracted.

1648
01:29:34,829 --> 01:29:37,149
ADHD cow and ADHD streamer.

1649
01:29:37,149 --> 01:29:39,310
This is a horrible, horrible fucking combination.

1650
01:29:39,949 --> 01:29:41,899
All right.

1651
01:29:42,619 --> 01:29:43,710
All right.

1652
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,989
Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady.

1653
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:46,539
Come here.

1654
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:53,390
Is she there?

1655
01:29:53,869 --> 01:29:54,430
Here she goes.

1656
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:25,319
Entertain is equals eat.

1657
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:25,960
What?

1658
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,630
Here we go.

1659
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:30,829
So now what?

1660
01:30:30,829 --> 01:30:31,869
Do I just put him down here

1661
01:30:31,869 --> 01:30:32,909
and knock on the door or...

1662
01:30:33,789 --> 01:30:36,960
I get 20,000 tribute for this.

1663
01:30:41,689 --> 01:30:42,810
Hello, handsome.

1664
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:43,210
Here we go.

1665
01:30:45,689 --> 01:30:56,319
This way, that way.

1666
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:56,960
This way, that way.

1667
01:30:58,750 --> 01:30:58,989
I...

1668
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:01,789
I can't believe it.

1669
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:02,829
I apologize.

1670
01:31:03,789 --> 01:31:06,989
I'm so sorry for accusing you wrongly.

1671
01:31:06,989 --> 01:31:10,270
I'll make sure the child is raised faithful and true to you.

1672
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,239
So what...

1673
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:15,000
That's all I had to do.

1674
01:31:17,319 --> 01:31:17,640
Okay.

1675
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,479
That works.

1676
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:29,229
That's 20,000 tribute.

1677
01:31:29,229 --> 01:31:29,710
What is he doing?

1678
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:32,060
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1679
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:32,460
What are you doing?

1680
01:31:35,739 --> 01:31:37,579
Shall I poo on that villager?

1681
01:31:41,069 --> 01:31:42,430
I don't think so.

1682
01:31:43,229 --> 01:31:43,710
Why?

1683
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:50,750
Why would you do that?

1684
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,750
Why would you even ask that question?

1685
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:55,550
Should I...

1686
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:57,470
I'm going to eat that villager.

1687
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:58,989
First, you're going to shit on them,

1688
01:31:58,989 --> 01:32:01,149
but you decided you're going to eat them instead.

1689
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:06,000
That's so rude.

1690
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,239
Okay.

1691
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:06,720
He doesn't know.

1692
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:07,920
He's like fucked up.

1693
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:09,819
Was he drunk?

1694
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,239
Where are you going?

1695
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:28,840
Gather from the fields?

1696
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:29,079
Yes.

1697
01:32:32,439 --> 01:32:33,159
Get all...

1698
01:32:33,159 --> 01:32:33,560
Do that.

1699
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,039
Yes.

1700
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:35,159
Gather from the fields and put it in.

1701
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:43,470
He can do it all in one go.

1702
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:43,710
All right.

1703
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:45,390
He's going to put it in the wood pile, isn't he?

1704
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:47,979
Nope.

1705
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:48,300
Good.

1706
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:50,829
What's going on?

1707
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:54,239
What's going on?

1708
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:56,779
What do I hear?

1709
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:57,100
Like a...

1710
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,779
We're going to attack?

1711
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:14,479
All right.

1712
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:15,119
Go to bed.

1713
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:15,840
Maybe he'll growl.

1714
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:16,079
All right.

1715
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:16,640
That's good.

1716
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:17,119
I need to...

1717
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:17,600
Wait a minute.

1718
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:24,090
I'm just going to go kill these people.

1719
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:24,810
What are we doing over here?

1720
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:25,289
What do we need?

1721
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,000
Sleep.

1722
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:27,880
We need some more buildings.

1723
01:33:29,529 --> 01:33:30,409
Is the storeroom built?

1724
01:33:30,409 --> 01:33:31,130
The storeroom is built.

1725
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:34,300
Everyone's just like kind of standing around.

1726
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:37,789
Disciple farmer.

1727
01:33:37,789 --> 01:33:38,829
Guys, get some shit done.

1728
01:33:39,789 --> 01:33:41,069
Disciple farmer.

1729
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:44,649
Oh, there's two more.

1730
01:33:44,649 --> 01:33:44,890
Okay.

1731
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:45,449
We need wood.

1732
01:33:46,409 --> 01:33:53,640
Disciple forester.

1733
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,670
Come here.

1734
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:55,229
Pick this up.

1735
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:55,550
Let's go.

1736
01:33:56,729 --> 01:33:58,329
For Valar.

1737
01:33:58,329 --> 01:33:59,689
What do we got over here?

1738
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:00,329
We have...

1739
01:34:00,329 --> 01:34:00,890
Let me see.

1740
01:34:01,689 --> 01:34:04,779
Stay over here.

1741
01:34:05,659 --> 01:34:08,779
Because seriously, if they attack,

1742
01:34:08,779 --> 01:34:09,819
I want them to be right there.

1743
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:14,750
I need trees.

1744
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,600
Hold on.

1745
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:17,920
Let me...

1746
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,319
Let's build another house.

1747
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:23,689
Forty...

1748
01:34:23,689 --> 01:34:24,569
How many people are here now?

1749
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:25,689
A lot, right?

1750
01:34:26,649 --> 01:34:26,970
Yeah.

1751
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:27,449
Let's do...

1752
01:34:28,409 --> 01:34:30,479
Just get another house here or whatever.

1753
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,829
I have so much food.

1754
01:34:34,829 --> 01:34:35,069
You know what?

1755
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:36,590
I'm going to take a bunch of this food.

1756
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:40,760
I'm going to take like fucking 10,000.

1757
01:34:41,399 --> 01:34:42,569
They're not even eating it.

1758
01:34:42,569 --> 01:34:43,770
I'm bringing it over here.

1759
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:50,859
That's evil?

1760
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:51,579
I own the place.

1761
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:55,279
What is he doing?

1762
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,880
I'm going to have a dump on that villager's head.

1763
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:05,600
Why do you keep saying this?

1764
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,720
What is wrong with you?

1765
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,520
He never does it though.

1766
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,920
He always threatens to take a shit on somebody,

1767
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:15,720
but he never does.

1768
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:24,909
Should you poo on somebody?

1769
01:35:25,869 --> 01:35:26,829
Wait, we're going to scroll.

1770
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:29,819
Come with me.

1771
01:35:32,539 --> 01:35:33,260
We're going to go...

1772
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:33,979
I want you over here.

1773
01:35:41,899 --> 01:35:42,380
Can I...

1774
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:43,500
Yeah, I want to take you...

1775
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,300
Take a walk.

1776
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:51,279
I want you to go impress these people over here.

1777
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:52,239
You go explore.

1778
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:54,590
Go learn some stuff.

1779
01:35:56,779 --> 01:35:57,899
Who needs homes?

1780
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:01,119
My chat's all fucked up.

1781
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:02,239
Hold on a second.

1782
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,119
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1783
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:04,960
I want...

1784
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,069
I need to save the goddamn game.

1785
01:36:07,069 --> 01:36:07,550
Holy shit.

1786
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:08,590
That would have been a disaster.

1787
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:11,069
Atma Starfish, thanks for the five community subs.

1788
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:12,859
Create a new save.

1789
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:22,239
Can you imagine two hours going by?

1790
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:23,119
Take over the time.

1791
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:25,289
All right, I'm ready.

1792
01:36:25,289 --> 01:36:25,770
Let's go.

1793
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:33,340
How you doing?

1794
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:40,590
It's nighttime, but there's no ore over here, though.

1795
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:44,189
I need to get over...

1796
01:36:44,189 --> 01:36:44,590
All right.

1797
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,550
Is it time to have a fight?

1798
01:36:47,739 --> 01:36:48,539
I got to fix my chat.

1799
01:36:48,539 --> 01:36:49,420
Hold on a second.

1800
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:49,899
It's like...

1801
01:36:49,899 --> 01:36:50,619
It's all fucked up.

1802
01:36:50,619 --> 01:36:51,659
I can't see what anybody's saying.

1803
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,319
Even in the other window.

1804
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:56,859
Hold on.

1805
01:36:56,859 --> 01:36:57,659
Okay.

1806
01:36:57,659 --> 01:37:00,539
Yeah, you guys are like...

1807
01:37:01,979 --> 01:37:07,119
I'm full two or three minutes behind me.

1808
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:07,439
All right.

1809
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:13,710
How do I just make it so the scroll doesn't happen?

1810
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:15,550
I can't, like, lock this.

1811
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:19,720
Is there a way to remove the ability to scroll on,

1812
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:21,000
like, chat window in Twitch?

1813
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,800
Because it doesn't matter what I do.

1814
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,000
I have to go get, like, uh...

1815
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,909
I have to go get, like, my iPad or something.

1816
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:29,630
Don't tell him.

1817
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:30,750
No, tell me!

1818
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:32,680
Remove the mouse wheel?

1819
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,819
I don't think anything...

1820
01:37:33,819 --> 01:37:34,779
Can I lock it?

1821
01:37:34,779 --> 01:37:38,970
Make it so the program takes exclusive rights to the cursor.

1822
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:42,489
I don't even know how the fuck to even do that.

1823
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,279
I'll just deal with it.

1824
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:46,600
I'll just deal with it.

1825
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:52,329
I'm just gonna have to do this, like, every, like, few minutes.

1826
01:37:52,329 --> 01:37:55,319
Here we go.

1827
01:37:55,319 --> 01:37:55,880
Okay.

1828
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:58,270
Full screen the game?

1829
01:37:58,270 --> 01:37:59,310
The game is full screen.

1830
01:37:59,310 --> 01:37:59,630
There...

1831
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:00,510
I mean, there is no...

1832
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:03,069
This game is, like, 12, 15 years old.

1833
01:38:03,069 --> 01:38:05,279
All right, here we go.

1834
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:05,760
Let's fight.

1835
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:06,640
Ready.

1836
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,930
Go fight.

1837
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:09,819
Go attack, go kill.

1838
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:24,989
Where are they?

1839
01:38:24,989 --> 01:38:26,729
Why don't you guys go the long way?

1840
01:38:27,369 --> 01:38:35,680
Jerma, can you explain how you got this game to work?

1841
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:36,720
Do you have the discs?

1842
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:37,039
Yes.

1843
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:41,550
Uh, so this game is currently running on the fan patch.

1844
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:44,000
There is...

1845
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,439
You have to get patch 1.1 and 1.2,

1846
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,359
and then you have to get the 1.3 fan patch,

1847
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,359
which fixes everything in the game.

1848
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:59,050
Wait, actually, you know what?

1849
01:38:59,050 --> 01:38:59,529
Can I just...

1850
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:01,720
Should I just attack?

1851
01:39:08,189 --> 01:39:08,510
Get it!

1852
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:16,590
Just spy cap this fucking thing.

1853
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:17,390
Who cares?

1854
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:18,350
They're not even coming back.

1855
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:19,310
They're not even paying attention.

1856
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,260
They're too busy.

1857
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:29,819
They're too busy fighting on the two-fort bridge

1858
01:39:29,819 --> 01:39:32,060
to realize I've taken the briefcase three times already.

1859
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:34,720
We win.

1860
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:36,640
Wait, they're not coming over here, are they?

1861
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:42,760
No, I'm gonna get it.

1862
01:39:49,529 --> 01:39:50,170
This is gonna be it.

1863
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:50,569
I got it.

1864
01:39:50,569 --> 01:39:53,119
I'm gonna own it.

1865
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,119
And then there's only one more town to take.

1866
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:56,159
Where's the creature?

1867
01:39:56,159 --> 01:40:01,689
I'm gonna eat that villager.

1868
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:05,319
Why are you doing it so menacingly?

1869
01:40:05,319 --> 01:40:05,560
All right.

1870
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:06,039
No, no, don't.

1871
01:40:06,039 --> 01:40:06,600
Don't.

1872
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:06,840
Just...

1873
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:08,970
No, no, no, no.

1874
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:09,369
Do not...

1875
01:40:14,619 --> 01:40:14,939
It's...

1876
01:40:14,939 --> 01:40:15,340
You know what?

1877
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:17,659
It's probably more efficient for him to eat villages

1878
01:40:17,659 --> 01:40:19,579
than to eat like 5,000 grain.

1879
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:22,279
I'm gonna be honest.

1880
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,399
Is it okay to destroy those trees?

1881
01:40:28,029 --> 01:40:30,590
I'm going to turn that tree into wood chippings.

1882
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:30,989
All right, good.

1883
01:40:30,989 --> 01:40:32,430
We can take out some of his rage.

1884
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:40,409
Take out some of your frustrations.

1885
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:41,289
Like, do it.

1886
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:44,520
Yeah!

1887
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:47,210
You need this.

1888
01:40:49,279 --> 01:40:50,640
I'm going to play with that villager.

1889
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,039
Good.

1890
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:51,439
Okay.

1891
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:52,000
Have fun.

1892
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:52,399
We're actually...

1893
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:53,279
We're gonna get it.

1894
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:55,119
I can't believe I just took this village without anything.

1895
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:04,779
No!

1896
01:41:04,779 --> 01:41:05,340
I can't.

1897
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:07,420
Ugh, it's fucking scroll wheel bullshit.

1898
01:41:10,729 --> 01:41:12,170
I'm actually gonna have to get my iPad.

1899
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:14,619
Like, I can't believe I got the village.

1900
01:41:24,279 --> 01:41:25,560
It's iPad time.

1901
01:41:26,779 --> 01:41:27,420
Punish him?

1902
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:27,979
Oh, wait, wait.

1903
01:41:27,979 --> 01:41:28,300
We got...

1904
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:28,619
Hold on.

1905
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,220
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

1906
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:33,500
We have your land.

1907
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:34,539
Now what the fuck are you gonna do?

1908
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:40,680
We're getting attacked, boys.

1909
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:40,840
Where?

1910
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:41,640
Kill them and drill them.

1911
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:41,960
Oh, fuck.

1912
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:42,600
Whoa, my God, dude.

1913
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:48,840
Uh-oh.

1914
01:41:50,909 --> 01:41:51,550
Are we winning?

1915
01:41:52,109 --> 01:41:53,479
We're not winning this fight.

1916
01:41:53,479 --> 01:41:54,359
We're not winning the fight.

1917
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:55,720
I just got fucking collapsed on...

1918
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:58,220
Oh, my God.

1919
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,739
They're here with their whole entire force.

1920
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:02,810
Uh...

1921
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:03,369
Murius!

1922
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:04,880
Murius!

1923
01:42:10,539 --> 01:42:12,380
Stop playing with trees.

1924
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:13,739
I need you over here for a little bit.

1925
01:42:17,739 --> 01:42:18,779
I'm out of breath.

1926
01:42:18,779 --> 01:42:20,699
Stop running with a tree in your hand.

1927
01:42:22,619 --> 01:42:23,579
What are you doing?

1928
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:27,470
I'm gonna gather from the field.

1929
01:42:29,229 --> 01:42:30,029
Good job.

1930
01:42:32,359 --> 01:42:32,680
Okay.

1931
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:34,359
Excellent work.

1932
01:42:34,359 --> 01:42:35,239
I need you over here.

1933
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:36,920
It's time for you to start.

1934
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,319
You have to...

1935
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:38,199
It's time for you to have fun.

1936
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,720
I need you over here.

1937
01:42:40,439 --> 01:42:44,430
I need you over here.

1938
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:45,310
Over here, over here, over here.

1939
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,600
You're being a bad parent.

1940
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,520
Look, I'm just trying to defend the world here.

1941
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:04,460
Coming.

1942
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:04,779
See?

1943
01:43:04,779 --> 01:43:05,899
This is what I'm talking about.

1944
01:43:05,899 --> 01:43:07,420
Show them your fucking anger.

1945
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,420
Show them your might.

1946
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:20,189
Tell them they can't be in here.

1947
01:43:21,079 --> 01:43:21,720
You know what to do.

1948
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:23,210
Eat them.

1949
01:43:24,489 --> 01:43:25,529
Leash to the army.

1950
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:33,210
I'm going to stomp all over the platoon.

1951
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:33,449
Good.

1952
01:43:34,329 --> 01:43:35,159
Do it.

1953
01:43:37,869 --> 01:43:38,590
Unleash it.

1954
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:42,350
Is it faster than you?

1955
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:42,590
Hold on.

1956
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:43,949
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1957
01:43:43,949 --> 01:43:44,189
All right.

1958
01:43:44,189 --> 01:43:44,590
Hey, hey, hey.

1959
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:44,909
Get him.

1960
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:48,779
Get him.

1961
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,430
There you go, Murius.

1962
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:55,550
Unleash your anger.

1963
01:43:58,539 --> 01:43:59,659
I'm out of breath.

1964
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:00,380
It's all right.

1965
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:01,340
Just kick another one.

1966
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:01,739
Eat one.

1967
01:44:02,539 --> 01:44:03,739
They have no match.

1968
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:05,960
Start eating people.

1969
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:07,579
Eat them.

1970
01:44:11,869 --> 01:44:12,510
There we go.

1971
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:17,529
Good job.

1972
01:44:17,529 --> 01:44:17,930
Come on.

1973
01:44:19,229 --> 01:44:20,109
I'm starving.

1974
01:44:20,109 --> 01:44:23,069
You'll have plenty of food in about five seconds, Murius.

1975
01:44:23,069 --> 01:44:24,350
Good fucking thunderclap.

1976
01:44:25,149 --> 01:44:25,710
There it is.

1977
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:27,069
Yes.

1978
01:44:28,029 --> 01:44:35,119
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

1979
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:38,380
Murius, I love you.

1980
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:40,699
You've done such a great job.

1981
01:44:40,699 --> 01:44:41,579
Unbelievable work.

1982
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:44,010
Unbelievable.

1983
01:44:45,609 --> 01:44:46,170
Nice work.

1984
01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:46,970
Do you see that rage?

1985
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:48,640
Okay.

1986
01:44:50,380 --> 01:45:16,439
Now literally eat as many of these people as you want.

1987
01:45:16,439 --> 01:45:18,199
He only eats live meat.

1988
01:45:34,729 --> 01:45:36,010
You're very good.

1989
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:38,329
I'll munch on their villagers all the time.

1990
01:45:38,329 --> 01:45:41,949
They taste so strange.

1991
01:45:41,949 --> 01:45:43,229
He's going to get a dig.

1992
01:45:43,229 --> 01:45:44,510
Look what he did.

1993
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:45,630
I'm so happy with him.

1994
01:45:49,529 --> 01:45:51,289
Taste for human flesh.

1995
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:58,199
All right.

1996
01:45:58,199 --> 01:45:59,640
Time for you to go to bed.

1997
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,039
You know what?

1998
01:46:00,039 --> 01:46:01,319
We wiped out their whole village.

1999
01:46:01,319 --> 01:46:01,800
Good job.

2000
01:46:02,359 --> 01:46:05,520
I actually need a...

2001
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,159
What do we need here?

2002
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,029
Inspect.

2003
01:46:10,189 --> 01:46:10,750
You can actually go...

2004
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:11,869
You can go to bed.

2005
01:46:11,869 --> 01:46:12,350
You need to rest.

2006
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,840
What do you think about that, Murius?

2007
01:46:20,109 --> 01:46:22,189
We need that storehouse built quicker.

2008
01:46:22,189 --> 01:46:25,949
I'm going to build the storehouse way more effective than he was in the last game.

2009
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,840
He's just aiming to please.

2010
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,199
He wants to please so much.

2011
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:33,920
That's not the store...

2012
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:34,560
Oh, it is.

2013
01:46:37,579 --> 01:46:38,220
So useful.

2014
01:46:40,489 --> 01:46:42,729
You deserve a week's rest after this.

2015
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,470
Excellent job.

2016
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:47,960
No, I didn't want to...

2017
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:49,399
Very, very good.

2018
01:46:50,829 --> 01:46:51,869
You are so...

2019
01:46:51,869 --> 01:46:53,229
What a good cow.

2020
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:55,149
Link?

2021
01:46:55,149 --> 01:46:55,869
Yeah.

2022
01:46:55,869 --> 01:47:02,960
In fact, I probably should bring him back to sleep.

2023
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:03,279
Okay.

2024
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:03,520
We need...

2025
01:47:04,909 --> 01:47:06,109
I have one more town to take over.

2026
01:47:06,109 --> 01:47:07,069
There's a scroll over here though.

2027
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:14,600
What a beautiful sunset.

2028
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,079
Yeah.

2029
01:47:15,079 --> 01:47:17,640
You gotta love a big ball of fire.

2030
01:47:21,069 --> 01:47:22,510
Let's see it again.

2031
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:28,590
By clicking the action button on the sky, the hand will change to sundial mode.

2032
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:32,590
When the action button is released, the sun will move in the heavens.

2033
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:34,029
I can change the day-night cycle?

2034
01:47:34,029 --> 01:47:35,949
The power of the sun.

2035
01:47:35,949 --> 01:47:39,789
But with great power comes great responsibility.

2036
01:47:39,789 --> 01:47:41,789
Force, show us how it's done.

2037
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:44,159
Change time to day.

2038
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,319
But all light needs a shadow.

2039
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:02,399
Change the time to night.

2040
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:05,979
I feel like this is fucking with everybody's head.

2041
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,420
Imagine you were outside when this happened.

2042
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:09,979
Well done.

2043
01:48:10,539 --> 01:48:12,239
All right.

2044
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:12,960
So you can chat in now.

2045
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:13,680
That's cool.

2046
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:34,039
Oh, rooster.

2047
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:37,449
No, I need help.

2048
01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:40,729
This rooster wakes me up every single day.

2049
01:48:40,729 --> 01:48:42,810
I can't get enough sleep.

2050
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:45,369
Please help me to silence it.

2051
01:48:45,369 --> 01:48:48,010
Maybe we can help him, leader.

2052
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:48,970
Such tasks...

2053
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:49,529
I don't understand.

2054
01:48:49,529 --> 01:48:51,369
...really rewards, you know.

2055
01:48:51,369 --> 01:48:54,810
Roosters always crow when the sun comes up.

2056
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:58,569
Perhaps if the sun came up a few times in a row,

2057
01:48:58,569 --> 01:49:01,449
the rooster would keep crowing until it gets hoarse.

2058
01:49:06,729 --> 01:49:09,449
But that's going to fuck up every country on earth.

2059
01:49:13,689 --> 01:49:16,649
Silence this rooster by making three days happen instantly.

2060
01:49:16,649 --> 01:49:17,369
And fuck up.

2061
01:49:17,369 --> 01:49:21,289
All of Wall Street will close and the Dow will drop 25 million points.

2062
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:23,050
Is this smart?

2063
01:49:50,039 --> 01:49:50,760
He's still going.

2064
01:49:55,609 --> 01:49:56,890
You're rapidly moving the earth.

2065
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:57,930
Everyone will just fly off.

2066
01:49:59,899 --> 01:50:00,939
We'd all be like, no!

2067
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:02,300
Everyone would fly into space.

2068
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:07,720
The rotating rooster has lost its voice.

2069
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:11,310
10,000?

2070
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:16,380
We'd be crushed?

2071
01:50:16,939 --> 01:50:18,859
Would we get crushed?

2072
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,439
I'm thinking of crushed.

2073
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:23,119
No, that's not right.

2074
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:24,640
Come on.

2075
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,359
I'm trying to satisfy the bloodlust of the people in chat.

2076
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:30,619
All right.

2077
01:50:30,619 --> 01:50:35,420
So, Marius, what are you up to?

2078
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:36,539
Hanging out?

2079
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,699
In fact, come back and go to sleep.

2080
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:39,340
I want you to grow.

2081
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:43,850
I want you to go to sleep.

2082
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:44,890
You've learned quite a lot.

2083
01:50:45,609 --> 01:50:46,729
I want you to stay in the pen.

2084
01:50:47,689 --> 01:50:49,449
And I want you to get some sleep.

2085
01:50:49,449 --> 01:50:52,520
How's everybody doing in this town?

2086
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:56,600
We've got more homes.

2087
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:56,920
Okay.

2088
01:50:57,479 --> 01:51:00,670
Let's get some new houses.

2089
01:51:00,670 --> 01:51:12,270
Population is booming in this town.

2090
01:51:12,989 --> 01:51:17,020
That'll be all right for now.

2091
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:17,260
Yep.

2092
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:18,300
I know I fucked it up.

2093
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:19,100
It's okay, dude.

2094
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:19,579
Don't worry.

2095
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:23,800
Another wink?

2096
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:24,520
What do you mean a wink?

2097
01:51:30,439 --> 01:51:31,239
That channel.

2098
01:51:31,239 --> 01:51:35,239
You guys are going to wake up at some point in the next four days.

2099
01:51:35,239 --> 01:51:38,439
And it's going to be like, oh, it's a popsicle stick joke now.

2100
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:47,369
I'm going to tell you what it is.

2101
01:51:47,369 --> 01:51:52,329
All right.

2102
01:51:52,329 --> 01:51:53,050
How are we doing?

2103
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:53,609
Is this good?

2104
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:54,890
This has been built.

2105
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:55,850
You have a storeroom now.

2106
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:56,090
Good.

2107
01:51:58,600 --> 01:51:59,960
Is there any ore over here?

2108
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:00,359
There is.

2109
01:52:00,359 --> 01:52:01,079
It's mine right here.

2110
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:03,199
Armory?

2111
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:04,399
Yeah.

2112
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:04,640
Okay.

2113
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:06,640
You guys can be like, we'll have another military here.

2114
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,479
Get some roads.

2115
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:13,100
I mean, how did you guys not even have any roads?

2116
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,079
How did you not have roads?

2117
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:34,569
That's fine.

2118
01:52:34,569 --> 01:52:35,130
Okay.

2119
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:36,859
A little bit more.

2120
01:52:36,859 --> 01:52:39,500
I got to pee.

2121
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:39,739
Fuck.

2122
01:52:39,739 --> 01:52:40,699
I got to pee.

2123
01:52:40,699 --> 01:52:40,939
All right.

2124
01:52:40,939 --> 01:52:41,420
I got to pee.

2125
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:41,819
I got to pee.

2126
01:52:41,819 --> 01:52:44,220
And I'm going to figure out how to fix this chat scrolling.

2127
01:52:44,619 --> 01:52:45,020
I got to pee.

2128
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:46,060
I'm going to pee my pants up your back.

2129
01:52:46,619 --> 01:52:47,680
Pause the game.

2130
01:52:47,680 --> 01:56:19,979
What's happening?

2131
01:56:19,979 --> 01:56:21,020
What is happening?

2132
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:21,739
We're back.

2133
01:56:21,739 --> 01:56:21,979
All right.

2134
01:56:21,979 --> 01:56:25,739
Let's see if this worked.

2135
01:56:25,739 --> 01:56:25,979
Yeah.

2136
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:28,539
I just did the fix you were talking about, Cad.

2137
01:56:28,539 --> 01:56:29,100
Thank you, Cad.

2138
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:31,100
Let's see if this works.

2139
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:32,939
And it might.

2140
01:56:32,939 --> 01:56:34,300
It may have fixed it.

2141
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,420
It may have fixed it.

2142
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:40,329
Okay.

2143
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:42,329
All right.

2144
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:44,649
Looks good.

2145
01:56:44,649 --> 01:56:50,189
All right.

2146
01:56:50,189 --> 01:56:51,229
Here we go.

2147
01:56:51,229 --> 01:56:51,789
We need to take off.

2148
01:56:51,789 --> 01:56:52,510
What's this?

2149
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:57,449
Should I make something new?

2150
01:56:57,449 --> 01:57:01,600
What's this thing?

2151
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:02,800
Ranged armory?

2152
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:08,640
All right.

2153
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,199
I can wait.

2154
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:11,520
I can recruit ranks of archers.

2155
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:13,069
Yeah.

2156
01:57:13,069 --> 01:57:15,479
Let's get it.

2157
01:57:15,479 --> 01:57:16,600
Lumber mill.

2158
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,000
Yeah.

2159
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:17,800
Let's get it.

2160
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:19,149
I don't know.

2161
01:57:19,149 --> 01:57:19,310
Wait.

2162
01:57:19,310 --> 01:57:19,550
Hold on.

2163
01:57:19,550 --> 01:57:24,170
I need to close this.

2164
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:24,970
This is done, right?

2165
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:28,029
Ranged archery.

2166
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:33,210
Wait, wait, wait.

2167
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:33,930
Is this?

2168
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:34,569
I'm confused.

2169
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:38,590
Do I have to build a separate building for ranged?

2170
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:44,640
I do.

2171
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,279
Oh, shit.

2172
01:57:45,279 --> 01:57:45,520
Okay.

2173
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,829
I need what?

2174
01:57:48,829 --> 01:57:48,989
All right.

2175
01:57:48,989 --> 01:57:49,869
We got some of you guys.

2176
01:57:49,869 --> 01:57:50,270
Let's go.

2177
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:51,149
We need some breeders.

2178
01:57:53,949 --> 01:57:55,069
Is there any men?

2179
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:02,140
All right.

2180
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:02,539
Let's go.

2181
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:04,220
Forester.

2182
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:07,229
Disciple forester.

2183
01:58:07,229 --> 01:58:07,789
Forester.

2184
01:58:09,069 --> 01:58:09,550
Forester.

2185
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:10,750
Disciple forester.

2186
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:11,229
Forester.

2187
01:58:11,949 --> 01:58:12,670
More.

2188
01:58:12,670 --> 01:58:13,390
We need more wood.

2189
01:58:13,390 --> 01:58:15,069
Disciple forester.

2190
01:58:15,069 --> 01:58:15,390
Wood.

2191
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,640
Disciple forester.

2192
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:19,760
And we need miners too.

2193
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:24,729
Subaru forester.

2194
01:58:24,729 --> 01:58:26,170
Disciple forester.

2195
01:58:27,689 --> 01:58:30,859
This is going to be the base of operations for military.

2196
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,229
Can I put you here?

2197
01:58:33,789 --> 01:58:35,710
Disciple mine worker.

2198
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:44,090
Disciple mine worker.

2199
01:58:44,729 --> 01:58:47,279
Disciple mine worker.

2200
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:47,600
All right.

2201
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:50,140
That sets that.

2202
01:58:50,779 --> 01:58:54,140
Now we have to deal with this one town here.

2203
01:58:54,779 --> 01:58:56,560
Where's Murius?

2204
01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:02,439
I think something's very funny.

2205
01:59:04,399 --> 01:59:05,199
What was so funny?

2206
01:59:06,199 --> 01:59:08,119
What are you laughing so hard at?

2207
01:59:08,119 --> 01:59:10,199
You like laughing at an old man?

2208
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:14,619
I don't understand.

2209
01:59:19,479 --> 01:59:19,720
Why?

2210
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:22,560
What a dick.

2211
01:59:26,350 --> 01:59:27,390
Haha, boomer.

2212
01:59:28,109 --> 01:59:32,109
I'm going to snack on that grain.

2213
01:59:32,109 --> 01:59:33,229
No, don't eat the grain.

2214
01:59:33,229 --> 01:59:34,350
You're supposed to eat people.

2215
01:59:34,909 --> 01:59:37,520
That's all right.

2216
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,659
All right.

2217
01:59:39,659 --> 01:59:41,899
I want an army and we're going to take over the last village.

2218
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:45,930
He's either going back to laugh at the fucking old guy again.

2219
01:59:50,829 --> 01:59:51,069
No.

2220
01:59:51,630 --> 02:00:05,239
Okay.

2221
02:00:05,239 --> 02:00:08,560
I don't know what his plan is, but you're rested.

2222
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,199
I need you down here.

2223
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:15,850
Come all the way over here because we're going to take over the next town with Murius.

2224
02:00:16,569 --> 02:00:19,079
And we're going to have some military here.

2225
02:00:19,079 --> 02:00:19,960
So come over here.

2226
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:21,399
Go for it.

2227
02:00:22,439 --> 02:00:22,680
Let's...

2228
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:24,619
Is this done?

2229
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,460
Not built yet?

2230
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:27,340
I want to build this.

2231
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,460
We're doing a whole military.

2232
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:33,659
Once we have enough wood.

2233
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:34,779
How much wood do I need?

2234
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:36,329
A lot.

2235
02:00:37,579 --> 02:00:38,539
I'm going to start helping out here.

2236
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:41,279
That's not right.

2237
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:45,359
The green ring you see is the extent of your influence.

2238
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:46,000
I need ore.

2239
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:47,039
All right.

2240
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:49,880
Let's get a fucking army.

2241
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:57,800
More ore.

2242
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:04,439
Come on.

2243
02:01:04,439 --> 02:01:09,359
Come on.

2244
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:15,100
Really?

2245
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:15,579
Come on.

2246
02:01:16,779 --> 02:01:17,340
Ah, okay.

2247
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:17,659
I got it.

2248
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:25,050
Can I just break it?

2249
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:25,449
What?

2250
02:01:25,449 --> 02:01:27,130
I thought I had to need more ore to build it.

2251
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:30,569
All right, guys.

2252
02:01:30,569 --> 02:01:32,090
It's time to fucking end mission one.

2253
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:42,270
I'm not picking the flag.

2254
02:01:42,829 --> 02:01:51,640
Is there...

2255
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:52,600
Not enough men.

2256
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:53,319
Oh, okay.

2257
02:01:54,039 --> 02:01:54,840
That's all right.

2258
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,600
We only needed a few.

2259
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:02,680
Look at that.

2260
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:05,399
I can't click the link because I have to alt-tab the game.

2261
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:06,279
And it might break.

2262
02:02:07,079 --> 02:02:17,560
And I'm scared to break the game unless I hit the pot.

2263
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:17,800
Okay.

2264
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:18,520
What the fuck was that?

2265
02:02:19,159 --> 02:02:19,319
All right.

2266
02:02:19,319 --> 02:02:19,720
You ready?

2267
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:21,710
Let's go.

2268
02:02:23,659 --> 02:02:24,380
The last town.

2269
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:25,100
Does it have military?

2270
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:26,539
I think I already killed all the military.

2271
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:28,510
I did.

2272
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:29,390
Take it over.

2273
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:29,869
Murius.

2274
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:33,899
Get over there.

2275
02:02:33,899 --> 02:02:47,899
Just buy another computer.

2276
02:02:48,619 --> 02:02:53,720
You know, you mean like buy like an old...

2277
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:56,039
You want me to capture a computer through a capture card?

2278
02:02:57,079 --> 02:03:01,850
Have an old computer and capture another with my other computer?

2279
02:03:02,729 --> 02:03:04,939
I mean, this game runs fine.

2280
02:03:05,659 --> 02:03:09,930
All right.

2281
02:03:09,930 --> 02:03:10,890
Murius, inspect it.

2282
02:03:11,449 --> 02:03:12,329
Just be a presence.

2283
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:15,529
I'm gonna play with that building.

2284
02:03:15,529 --> 02:03:15,770
Yes.

2285
02:03:16,729 --> 02:03:17,289
Go for it.

2286
02:03:18,729 --> 02:03:19,289
Learn.

2287
02:03:19,289 --> 02:03:19,850
Think.

2288
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:20,409
Touch.

2289
02:03:20,409 --> 02:03:20,970
Inspect.

2290
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:24,430
Oh, you could eat somebody.

2291
02:03:24,430 --> 02:03:24,989
That works too.

2292
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:43,079
Oh, screaming.

2293
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:59,100
Did he step in it?

2294
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:01,310
Oh, no.

2295
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:02,189
Six flags.

2296
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:08,439
He just shit in their food.

2297
02:04:10,939 --> 02:04:12,829
You did it.

2298
02:04:12,829 --> 02:04:14,510
No, don't pick up a person.

2299
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:15,630
What are you doing?

2300
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:16,510
They're capturing.

2301
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:18,760
Put him down.

2302
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,319
Put him down.

2303
02:04:20,039 --> 02:04:20,520
Put him down.

2304
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:23,239
Wait, are you putting him into the...

2305
02:04:23,239 --> 02:04:23,800
What are you doing?

2306
02:04:24,359 --> 02:04:28,439
You're telling him to work in the field?

2307
02:04:32,489 --> 02:04:33,930
Sleep next to the building?

2308
02:04:33,930 --> 02:04:34,409
No, no, no.

2309
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:39,930
We almost got it.

2310
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:42,699
He's just a baby.

2311
02:04:42,699 --> 02:04:43,819
He doesn't really know what he's doing.

2312
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:52,920
All right.

2313
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:54,359
That was such a toddler run.

2314
02:04:55,079 --> 02:04:56,409
If I've ever seen one.

2315
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:19,800
It's time for Murius to get a skill tree.

2316
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:40,670
Oh, okay.

2317
02:05:42,039 --> 02:05:45,640
If you want to leave this land, click on the gold scroll.

2318
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:48,880
Let's go.

2319
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:55,739
Are you sure you wish to leave the land again to confirm?

2320
02:05:55,739 --> 02:05:56,380
Yeah, let's go.

2321
02:05:57,260 --> 02:06:02,880
I'm ready to rock and roll.

2322
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:09,760
Don't be evil.

2323
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:15,130
I thought that was a pop-up window talking about the game crashed.

2324
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:17,050
And it was, do you want to force quit?

2325
02:06:17,050 --> 02:06:18,699
I thought that's what this was.

2326
02:06:18,699 --> 02:06:20,779
Look, I'm only 1% evil, guys.

2327
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,319
Number of towns taken by force, three.

2328
02:06:25,039 --> 02:06:25,840
One for...

2329
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:26,479
Okay.

2330
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:26,880
Creature.

2331
02:06:27,439 --> 02:06:29,609
Creature is only 5% evil.

2332
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:31,479
Fatness.

2333
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:33,789
Fatness, fatness.

2334
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,949
What does that even mean?

2335
02:06:39,949 --> 02:06:40,350
Fitness.

2336
02:06:44,350 --> 02:06:45,880
Height, four.

2337
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:47,390
Final.

2338
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:48,909
Hit points, 100.

2339
02:06:48,909 --> 02:06:50,829
Number of bowel movements, 11.

2340
02:06:50,829 --> 02:06:52,430
Killed 34 people.

2341
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:55,529
It's eight, six villagers, okay.

2342
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:01,279
World.

2343
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:01,760
Happiness.

2344
02:07:03,479 --> 02:07:03,880
Vital.

2345
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:04,279
Yeah, all right.

2346
02:07:04,279 --> 02:07:05,000
We're good.

2347
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,800
Let's go.

2348
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:10,699
34 people killed, only 4% evil.

2349
02:07:10,699 --> 02:07:12,460
Well, those were attacking people.

2350
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:13,899
That was an attacking group.

2351
02:07:14,539 --> 02:07:20,039
Horse land.

2352
02:07:20,039 --> 02:07:23,609
I'm certain they'll join us against the Aztec hordes.

2353
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:26,409
And they have a creature, too.

2354
02:07:26,409 --> 02:07:28,810
We need to build a town here, though.

2355
02:07:28,810 --> 02:07:30,649
We need to try to grow.

2356
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:34,250
First, let's look at the Norse.

2357
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:37,130
They seems they have a weak concentrate.

2358
02:07:37,130 --> 02:07:41,210
And your godly powers will often let you hear his thoughts.

2359
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:42,250
I was the aggressor?

2360
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:43,930
Greeks on my homeland?

2361
02:07:44,489 --> 02:07:48,170
I saw them all die at the hands of the Aztecs!

2362
02:07:49,369 --> 02:07:50,010
Who's talking?

2363
02:07:50,810 --> 02:07:54,859
Do they have a devil and an angel?

2364
02:07:54,859 --> 02:07:57,659
If we build up an impressive enough town,

2365
02:07:57,659 --> 02:08:00,539
these Norse will flock to join us.

2366
02:08:00,539 --> 02:08:02,939
Or if we build a big army,

2367
02:08:02,939 --> 02:08:05,840
we can hunt them down with a sword.

2368
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:10,079
Norse leader?

2369
02:08:10,079 --> 02:08:11,760
Yeah, but who is the Norse leader?

2370
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:18,220
Fucking Odin?

2371
02:08:18,939 --> 02:08:21,420
All right, here we go.

2372
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,319
Where's Murius?

2373
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:24,359
Still growing.

2374
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:27,529
All right, here we go.

2375
02:08:27,529 --> 02:08:32,170
We need to start building.

2376
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:34,489
We should start making houses.

2377
02:08:34,489 --> 02:08:35,850
Wait, wait, no, block out the town.

2378
02:08:35,850 --> 02:08:36,329
Here we go.

2379
02:08:36,329 --> 02:08:36,649
Ready?

2380
02:08:36,649 --> 02:08:39,869
Let's get a group this like out here.

2381
02:08:39,869 --> 02:08:41,949
This is going to be out to here.

2382
02:08:41,949 --> 02:08:45,229
This is going to be houses over this way.

2383
02:08:45,229 --> 02:08:49,529
We're going to have our temples going to go around here.

2384
02:08:50,329 --> 02:08:54,909
Whatever, something like that.

2385
02:08:54,909 --> 02:08:56,590
And that looks all right for now.

2386
02:08:57,229 --> 02:08:57,869
What is this?

2387
02:08:57,869 --> 02:09:01,130
Ah, yes, walls.

2388
02:09:01,369 --> 02:09:02,569
Walls.

2389
02:09:02,569 --> 02:09:05,850
These are vital to the defense of your city.

2390
02:09:05,850 --> 02:09:07,529
We need to build this wall

2391
02:09:07,529 --> 02:09:10,170
to ensure the Norse can't invade.

2392
02:09:10,170 --> 02:09:12,970
Click the action button on the turret once.

2393
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:14,970
Drag and then click to place it.

2394
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:25,710
Okay, that was so bad.

2395
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:28,350
I do enjoy the safe, warm feeling.

2396
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:29,710
There's no wall here.

2397
02:09:29,710 --> 02:09:31,229
It's foundation.

2398
02:09:32,189 --> 02:09:34,079
It's an ugly ass wall.

2399
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,600
Drag wall from...

2400
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:37,479
Wait, didn't I just...

2401
02:09:38,359 --> 02:09:46,539
Did I do this right?

2402
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:49,689
Needs like ore or something?

2403
02:09:49,689 --> 02:09:50,569
I feel like this is wrong.

2404
02:09:51,369 --> 02:09:56,079
All right, whatever.

2405
02:09:56,079 --> 02:09:58,000
Let's get the process going here.

2406
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:02,409
So we need houses.

2407
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:04,250
We need a storeroom, first of all.

2408
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:05,850
Let's get that over here.

2409
02:10:08,170 --> 02:10:09,689
Right there in a good spot.

2410
02:10:09,689 --> 02:10:10,649
Wait, where's like the most...

2411
02:10:11,289 --> 02:10:12,250
No, I want this over here.

2412
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:15,800
Definitely put this over here.

2413
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:16,760
Near all this other shit.

2414
02:10:17,399 --> 02:10:20,750
Can I build it like right here?

2415
02:10:22,029 --> 02:10:22,430
I can't.

2416
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:23,949
All right, right next to trees and shit.

2417
02:10:23,949 --> 02:10:26,989
Look, the people have remembered all about altars.

2418
02:10:26,989 --> 02:10:30,430
Altars are where you can focus your godly miracles.

2419
02:10:30,909 --> 02:10:32,829
Let's build one as soon as possible.

2420
02:10:32,829 --> 02:10:34,640
Oh, as soon as possible.

2421
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:36,079
What do you mean, as soon as possible?

2422
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:40,699
Are you helping?

2423
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:44,119
He's on a tree in your room?

2424
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:48,939
I don't know what his obsession is

2425
02:10:48,939 --> 02:10:50,380
with picking up trees and just putting them down.

2426
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:52,399
All right, what is this for?

2427
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,729
I'm going to put this up here.

2428
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:56,239
Out of the way.

2429
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:58,560
Like over here or something?

2430
02:10:59,119 --> 02:10:59,920
I'm going to put this over here.

2431
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:03,899
Such power can be wielded with an altar.

2432
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:05,770
Oh, it's an altar.

2433
02:11:06,649 --> 02:11:11,439
All right, what about a mine?

2434
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:12,560
Are there any mines over here?

2435
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:15,789
This is not really a mine.

2436
02:11:15,789 --> 02:11:16,270
It's up here.

2437
02:11:16,270 --> 02:11:21,319
Okay, you're enabling him.

2438
02:11:22,619 --> 02:11:23,260
No, all right.

2439
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:26,680
How about that was not?

2440
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:27,800
All right, that was bad.

2441
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,359
That was bad.

2442
02:11:28,359 --> 02:11:29,640
You just stepped on a village's head.

2443
02:11:30,359 --> 02:11:30,920
Don't do that.

2444
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:35,550
All right, you just you literally just killed somebody for no reason,

2445
02:11:35,550 --> 02:11:38,239
but we don't waste shit around here.

2446
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:43,119
Astonishing one.

2447
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:46,970
We're protected against the Norse.

2448
02:11:47,529 --> 02:11:50,810
If you need a reminder of what your objectives are,

2449
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:52,890
go to the objectives part of the menu.

2450
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:53,529
What was I doing?

2451
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:57,819
These crafty Greeks are building walls,

2452
02:11:57,819 --> 02:12:00,140
and so they should send a troop.

2453
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:00,859
Did you just do it again?

2454
02:12:01,899 --> 02:12:03,100
Oh, well, that was a split.

2455
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:08,090
That was really cool.

2456
02:12:08,729 --> 02:12:10,399
I'm going to play.

2457
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:11,039
All right, clay.

2458
02:12:11,039 --> 02:12:11,840
Don't hurt anybody.

2459
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,119
Don't stomp on people.

2460
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:15,420
Okay, I need to build this.

2461
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:17,899
Okay, we need to be foresters and builders.

2462
02:12:22,699 --> 02:12:23,899
Forrester, forrester.

2463
02:12:24,779 --> 02:12:26,300
For work, we need some breeders and houses.

2464
02:12:27,819 --> 02:12:29,420
All right, we're getting houses, houses, houses.

2465
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,140
Let's go.

2466
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:30,859
This is house.

2467
02:12:35,579 --> 02:12:36,539
You're not helping.

2468
02:12:36,539 --> 02:12:37,420
You're not doing anything.

2469
02:12:46,239 --> 02:12:46,960
Fucking idiot.

2470
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:50,090
Like, you're actually being stupid now.

2471
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:55,710
Get this out of the way.

2472
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:04,060
He's trying.

2473
02:13:05,020 --> 02:13:05,899
He's not, oh, he's not.

2474
02:13:05,899 --> 02:13:07,260
He's just throwing stuff around.

2475
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:16,619
He is still a baby.

2476
02:13:16,619 --> 02:13:17,420
Need a farm.

2477
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,560
I need to poo fairly badly.

2478
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:21,960
What do you mean?

2479
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:23,479
What is fairly bad?

2480
02:13:23,479 --> 02:13:24,279
All right, wait, wait, wait.

2481
02:13:24,279 --> 02:13:24,840
I need fields.

2482
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:28,569
Fields are going to go near the storeroom over here.

2483
02:13:29,289 --> 02:13:30,970
Because this is where all the forests are.

2484
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:32,170
And then mine is right there too.

2485
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:33,289
The fields are all going over here.

2486
02:13:35,949 --> 02:13:36,350
Right here.

2487
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:38,430
I want another one.

2488
02:13:39,149 --> 02:13:46,670
I'm going to construct that building.

2489
02:13:47,869 --> 02:13:48,189
Good.

2490
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:49,789
Please do.

2491
02:13:56,090 --> 02:13:57,609
Oh, you can make it bigger.

2492
02:13:57,609 --> 02:13:59,529
Oh, I wish I knew that.

2493
02:13:59,529 --> 02:14:02,079
Okay, nice job.

2494
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:04,640
Should I gather rocks?

2495
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:06,170
Yeah, absolutely.

2496
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:11,960
Definitely, go get some rocks.

2497
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:15,840
Very helpful.

2498
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:22,960
Any more buildings?

2499
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:24,640
What's the current need?

2500
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:26,560
Ore, we need ore.

2501
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:28,159
Let me get like another...

2502
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:32,350
Put this over here.

2503
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:38,319
I'm going to put one more of one for the influence.

2504
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:41,100
All right, let's go, let's go.

2505
02:14:41,979 --> 02:14:42,619
How's this looking?

2506
02:14:42,619 --> 02:14:44,779
I need some more wood.

2507
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:47,760
Give us a cow emote.

2508
02:14:49,529 --> 02:14:51,289
Actually, it wouldn't really be that bad, would it?

2509
02:14:52,090 --> 02:14:58,140
We're going to do a whole line of houses.

2510
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:14,520
That house is a little ugly, but it's all right.

2511
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:15,319
We need food too.

2512
02:15:15,319 --> 02:15:16,520
I know, I'm working on it.

2513
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:17,079
I'm working on it.

2514
02:15:21,609 --> 02:15:24,409
All right, that's it, that's it.

2515
02:15:24,409 --> 02:15:25,369
That's it, that's it.

2516
02:15:25,369 --> 02:15:26,010
Enough houses.

2517
02:15:26,569 --> 02:15:29,199
Come over here, I'll help you build this.

2518
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:37,600
I mean, he's not constructing the building.

2519
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:39,199
He's just putting wood next to it.

2520
02:15:40,159 --> 02:15:46,590
Your village is starving.

2521
02:15:48,489 --> 02:15:50,489
Well, I have to get the necessities ready.

2522
02:15:51,289 --> 02:15:55,619
Most of them.

2523
02:15:56,399 --> 02:16:02,399
The whole town is a one road.

2524
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:03,039
It's all right.

2525
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:07,979
Okay, now we're going to...

2526
02:16:08,939 --> 02:16:09,979
I need farmers.

2527
02:16:11,449 --> 02:16:13,289
So some of you foresters come over here.

2528
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:18,479
Let's get this shit rolling.

2529
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:20,079
Can the Aztecs through?

2530
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:22,399
This is Norse land.

2531
02:16:22,399 --> 02:16:24,319
No intruders must be allowed.

2532
02:16:24,319 --> 02:16:24,819
Eat this.

2533
02:16:26,199 --> 02:16:26,699
Eat this.

2534
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:28,600
Stop shitting bull.

2535
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:29,640
Like, is it fertilizer?

2536
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:30,840
I mean, it could be.

2537
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:34,159
I need breeders too.

2538
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:36,719
I'm starving.

2539
02:16:36,719 --> 02:16:37,840
Eat. No, eat it.

2540
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:39,459
Eat it.

2541
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:41,579
You just had an opportunity to eat.

2542
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:50,430
Breeders.

2543
02:16:51,069 --> 02:16:53,069
Disciple breeder.

2544
02:16:53,069 --> 02:16:54,610
I need a couple more breeders.

2545
02:16:55,170 --> 02:16:55,670
Good.

2546
02:16:55,809 --> 02:16:57,170
Disciple breeder.

2547
02:16:57,170 --> 02:16:58,370
What's my population look like?

2548
02:16:59,170 --> 02:17:00,450
Disciple breeder.

2549
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:01,010
All right, good.

2550
02:17:04,739 --> 02:17:05,540
You actually did something.

2551
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:06,340
Holy shit.

2552
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:08,180
You have built an altar.

2553
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:10,260
He actually did something.

2554
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:11,700
He actually put it in the right spot too.

2555
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:12,200
Nice work.

2556
02:17:17,010 --> 02:17:18,049
Sorry, you can have a snack.

2557
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:24,139
Altars work on a power called man.

2558
02:17:24,139 --> 02:17:27,180
You can generate manna by creating worshipers.

2559
02:17:27,180 --> 02:17:28,940
Is he going to learn how to do the water spell again?

2560
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:29,899
Create a worshiper.

2561
02:17:29,899 --> 02:17:30,860
Show us you can do it.

2562
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:33,979
Okay, create a worshiper.

2563
02:17:33,979 --> 02:17:36,299
Create disciple worshiper to assist manna.

2564
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:40,239
Nah, I gotta keep doing this.

2565
02:17:40,239 --> 02:17:41,200
You're not doing anything.

2566
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,059
Come here.

2567
02:17:43,059 --> 02:17:43,620
Worship her.

2568
02:17:47,069 --> 02:17:48,590
Now I can start casting spells.

2569
02:17:48,590 --> 02:17:51,389
Of course, more worshipers mean more manna.

2570
02:17:51,389 --> 02:17:54,639
Of course, costs manna.

2571
02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:57,200
And you need worshipers to generate manna.

2572
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:58,559
Simple.

2573
02:17:58,559 --> 02:17:59,920
And get this.

2574
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:04,079
You can drop people straight into the altar to create manna too.

2575
02:18:04,639 --> 02:18:06,079
You won't ever see him again though.

2576
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:07,280
I gotta harvest this shit myself.

2577
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:07,840
Look at this.

2578
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:12,959
I need more farmers.

2579
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:13,440
Look at this shit.

2580
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:14,239
It's not enough.

2581
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:38,479
Still, give it a try, boss.

2582
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:39,840
Miracle.

2583
02:18:42,479 --> 02:18:42,799
Okay.

2584
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:44,799
I have a water miracle.

2585
02:18:44,799 --> 02:18:46,000
And drop it on the field.

2586
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:49,280
Oh, fuck.

2587
02:18:51,819 --> 02:18:53,579
What field does he want me to drop it on?

2588
02:18:54,459 --> 02:18:56,530
Drop it on the field over there?

2589
02:18:56,530 --> 02:18:57,409
Like my field?

2590
02:18:58,209 --> 02:18:59,329
Does it matter?

2591
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:09,040
I didn't know if there was one for the tutorial or something.

2592
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:10,159
I had to do it in a specific place.

2593
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:12,719
All right, lots of food.

2594
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:15,340
There's also something new over here.

2595
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:21,389
If you want your town to grow quickly, it'll need lots of food.

2596
02:19:22,670 --> 02:19:26,190
Our creature can help with this by gathering crops.

2597
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:32,530
All you have to do is assign him the role of gatherer near a field.

2598
02:19:33,659 --> 02:19:37,579
To assign the creature a role, open the creature roles interface.

2599
02:19:38,979 --> 02:19:41,780
Select the green gatherer role button.

2600
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:45,540
This changes the creature's role and puts the leash in your hand.

2601
02:19:46,180 --> 02:19:48,930
Okay, creature role.

2602
02:19:49,489 --> 02:19:49,969
Gatherer.

2603
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:53,040
Excellent.

2604
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,280
Now just double click the action button

2605
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:57,440
where you want the creature to perform the role.

2606
02:19:58,079 --> 02:20:00,430
He's asleep.

2607
02:20:01,069 --> 02:20:02,590
I mean, over here.

2608
02:20:02,590 --> 02:20:04,510
That means the big one is probably the best one to do.

2609
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:13,940
See the radius around the flag?

2610
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:16,739
The creature will gather resources from within.

2611
02:20:16,739 --> 02:20:17,780
That's actually really cool.

2612
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:20,579
Always carry out roles inside the radius.

2613
02:20:20,579 --> 02:20:21,379
Wake his ass up.

2614
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:23,860
Hey, relax.

2615
02:20:24,659 --> 02:20:28,180
At the moment, your creature isn't a very good collector.

2616
02:20:28,180 --> 02:20:30,500
He's not gathering much grain each time.

2617
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:35,620
This is because he's a level one gatherer.

2618
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:39,459
You could improve his performance in roles by spending triple.

2619
02:20:39,459 --> 02:20:40,819
Free will.

2620
02:20:40,819 --> 02:20:42,340
Should we just give him free will?

2621
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:43,059
Clever, hey?

2622
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:45,940
Let's give him complete free will.

2623
02:20:47,219 --> 02:20:51,139
A builder or an entertainer to keep the people amused.

2624
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:54,850
The creatures help with the construction.

2625
02:20:54,930 --> 02:20:56,690
Of anything in the town.

2626
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:59,569
You're supposed to be gathering food.

2627
02:20:59,569 --> 02:21:01,729
We'll make him serve as an army.

2628
02:21:01,729 --> 02:21:03,329
He loves trees.

2629
02:21:03,329 --> 02:21:07,329
Our creature is still small and he's not a skilled warrior.

2630
02:21:07,329 --> 02:21:10,610
You can use tribute to upgrade his warrior role

2631
02:21:10,610 --> 02:21:12,770
and he'll get way more lethal.

2632
02:21:14,530 --> 02:21:19,649
Yes, or you can simply leave him in free will mode.

2633
02:21:19,649 --> 02:21:23,250
He'll do whatever he wants and whatever you've taught him.

2634
02:21:23,250 --> 02:21:24,530
He's a free spirit.

2635
02:21:24,530 --> 02:21:26,930
The last thing you need to know about roles

2636
02:21:26,930 --> 02:21:30,049
is that they affect your creature's free will.

2637
02:21:30,049 --> 02:21:33,329
Yes, the longer he remains in a role,

2638
02:21:33,329 --> 02:21:35,250
the less free will he'll have.

2639
02:21:35,250 --> 02:21:35,729
Oh, no.

2640
02:21:36,770 --> 02:21:39,010
Leave him in a role for too long.

2641
02:21:39,010 --> 02:21:41,840
Become more like a machine than a pet.

2642
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:42,319
Oh, no.

2643
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:44,799
Using him in roles for a while is fine.

2644
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:47,040
I don't like that.

2645
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,440
And you can see how much free will he has

2646
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:52,559
by looking at this bar on the creature interface.

2647
02:21:52,559 --> 02:21:53,840
Okay, interesting.

2648
02:21:54,639 --> 02:21:57,040
To remove your creature from a role,

2649
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,959
click on the free will button.

2650
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:03,969
Now play around with roles and stuff, boss.

2651
02:22:03,969 --> 02:22:06,690
And see if you can get a bigger town out of it.

2652
02:22:06,690 --> 02:22:10,930
And remember, if you get attacked, make him a warrior.

2653
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:12,530
We share the hatred.

2654
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:15,729
Who do these creeps think they are?

2655
02:22:15,729 --> 02:22:17,649
All right, well, back to free will.

2656
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:21,760
Free will.

2657
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:25,760
You can do whatever you want.

2658
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:26,719
You don't have to gather anymore.

2659
02:22:26,719 --> 02:22:27,200
Free will.

2660
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:30,129
You are free.

2661
02:22:30,129 --> 02:22:32,370
I don't want you just gathering food all day.

2662
02:22:33,329 --> 02:22:35,870
All right, let me build.

2663
02:22:35,870 --> 02:22:39,629
I got to build a warrior's area.

2664
02:22:42,270 --> 02:22:47,809
We need a armory because, I mean, we have to have one.

2665
02:22:47,809 --> 02:22:48,530
Put it at the gate.

2666
02:22:49,489 --> 02:22:50,049
Right here.

2667
02:22:51,629 --> 02:22:54,350
I thought these Greeks were a peaceful race.

2668
02:22:54,350 --> 02:22:54,590
What?

2669
02:22:54,590 --> 02:22:55,389
You saw me build that.

2670
02:22:55,389 --> 02:22:56,350
I must watch closely.

2671
02:22:58,110 --> 02:22:58,670
Oh, shit.

2672
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:01,600
Well, he's been, what?

2673
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:03,360
He's been threatening me the whole fucking level.

2674
02:23:04,159 --> 02:23:05,440
Oh, these Greeks.

2675
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:06,719
I thought they were destroyed.

2676
02:23:06,719 --> 02:23:08,799
And I'm going to kill them and destroy them.

2677
02:23:08,799 --> 02:23:10,239
I thought the Aztecs wiped them out.

2678
02:23:10,239 --> 02:23:11,760
Oh, I thought they were a peaceful people.

2679
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:12,319
What the fuck?

2680
02:23:12,879 --> 02:23:16,180
How dare they encroach on my land?

2681
02:23:16,739 --> 02:23:21,549
Murius.

2682
02:23:22,270 --> 02:23:22,829
Might need you.

2683
02:23:28,530 --> 02:23:29,010
Murius.

2684
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:32,420
No, don't eat this one.

2685
02:23:33,059 --> 02:23:33,700
Don't eat this one.

2686
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:34,500
This one's important.

2687
02:23:35,870 --> 02:23:36,430
Put down.

2688
02:23:37,870 --> 02:23:38,110
Okay.

2689
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:51,600
I'm not going to kill anybody yet.

2690
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:52,000
Not yet.

2691
02:23:52,879 --> 02:23:57,780
Okay, let's see.

2692
02:23:57,780 --> 02:23:59,540
Let's water the mountain.

2693
02:24:00,579 --> 02:24:01,540
Here we go.

2694
02:24:01,540 --> 02:24:01,780
Ready?

2695
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:02,739
Murius, take a look at this.

2696
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:06,020
He's kicked a rock.

2697
02:24:06,020 --> 02:24:06,739
Come here, Murius.

2698
02:24:06,739 --> 02:24:07,540
Look.

2699
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:08,100
Look what I have.

2700
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:12,979
Isn't that interesting?

2701
02:24:12,979 --> 02:24:13,940
Don't you think that was interesting?

2702
02:24:13,940 --> 02:24:14,500
Wonderful.

2703
02:24:16,239 --> 02:24:16,719
Cool, huh?

2704
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,899
Why are you so sad?

2705
02:24:24,719 --> 02:24:25,200
What's wrong?

2706
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:28,780
You go do whatever you want.

2707
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:34,049
It's all about the trees.

2708
02:24:34,049 --> 02:24:34,610
And that's fine.

2709
02:24:35,569 --> 02:24:37,489
As long as you gather it and put it in the right spot.

2710
02:24:41,260 --> 02:24:41,579
All right.

2711
02:24:41,579 --> 02:24:43,420
I need, how's the armory looking?

2712
02:24:43,420 --> 02:24:44,139
Not even close.

2713
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:48,319
The Aztecs want to rule.

2714
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:50,239
They need the Greeks destroyed.

2715
02:24:50,879 --> 02:25:00,819
I'm just preparing in case I get attacked.

2716
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:05,809
What the hell was I doing here?

2717
02:25:05,809 --> 02:25:05,969
All right.

2718
02:25:05,969 --> 02:25:06,610
What do we need?

2719
02:25:06,610 --> 02:25:07,329
What are our needs?

2720
02:25:08,639 --> 02:25:09,760
Food, more food.

2721
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:11,280
We have plenty of wood.

2722
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:11,920
More food.

2723
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:16,260
How can we?

2724
02:25:18,690 --> 02:25:20,770
We need more farmers.

2725
02:25:21,649 --> 02:25:23,250
How many people are actually farming right now?

2726
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:25,680
Zero out of seven.

2727
02:25:26,909 --> 02:25:27,790
One out of five.

2728
02:25:29,219 --> 02:25:30,180
One out of eight.

2729
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:30,899
How the fuck?

2730
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:36,700
We need more farms.

2731
02:25:37,739 --> 02:25:38,299
Get over here.

2732
02:25:47,409 --> 02:25:48,290
Your cow is eating them.

2733
02:25:48,290 --> 02:25:49,569
No, he's fine.

2734
02:25:49,569 --> 02:25:50,450
He's just dancing.

2735
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:57,600
Look, they're having a good time.

2736
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:00,399
Is he growing?

2737
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:04,989
All right.

2738
02:26:04,989 --> 02:26:06,430
Let this guy hang out and be happy.

2739
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:08,500
Yeah.

2740
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:09,139
This split.

2741
02:26:09,139 --> 02:26:10,260
I'm glad this splits back.

2742
02:26:11,459 --> 02:26:12,020
More farmers.

2743
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:15,680
All right.

2744
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:19,200
Now we got a lot of workers in the field.

2745
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:20,940
All right.

2746
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:22,780
We have at least 10 people doing this.

2747
02:26:23,659 --> 02:26:27,100
The Greeks mock us with their very existence.

2748
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:29,459
You're going to deposit?

2749
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:31,229
Deposit rock.

2750
02:26:35,149 --> 02:26:36,670
That was whatever.

2751
02:26:37,389 --> 02:26:40,110
Should I turn these rocks around with some poo?

2752
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:43,760
Sure.

2753
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:47,500
Poo on the rocks if that's really what you want to do.

2754
02:26:48,219 --> 02:26:51,969
In fact, it's better if you poo on the rocks and not on people

2755
02:26:51,969 --> 02:26:53,569
because people will be very upset by that.

2756
02:26:53,569 --> 02:26:55,569
So if you have to go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom behind a tree.

2757
02:26:56,129 --> 02:26:57,489
Should I poo on that villager?

2758
02:26:58,639 --> 02:27:00,719
No, don't poo on a villager.

2759
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:03,950
You just asked it to poo on a rock.

2760
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:06,030
Why are you asking this question now?

2761
02:27:06,030 --> 02:27:08,350
I just told you to poo on a rock.

2762
02:27:19,649 --> 02:27:20,129
I can't.

2763
02:27:20,129 --> 02:27:20,610
All right.

2764
02:27:20,610 --> 02:27:23,409
This curiosity is killing me right now.

2765
02:27:24,209 --> 02:27:25,170
What does this even mean?

2766
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:28,850
He doesn't actually poop on them, right?

2767
02:27:29,569 --> 02:27:35,760
He's lying.

2768
02:27:38,879 --> 02:27:39,760
He can't get it.

2769
02:28:02,290 --> 02:28:03,170
Clean up the poo.

2770
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:05,899
Oh, he just hit his head.

2771
02:28:05,899 --> 02:28:06,459
Are you all right?

2772
02:28:07,459 --> 02:28:07,700
All right.

2773
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:09,219
Let's keep going.

2774
02:28:09,860 --> 02:28:11,260
I'm going to gather food.

2775
02:28:11,260 --> 02:28:11,899
Good work.

2776
02:28:11,899 --> 02:28:12,299
Yes.

2777
02:28:12,299 --> 02:28:12,700
Excellent.

2778
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:14,639
How are we doing on food?

2779
02:28:14,639 --> 02:28:15,120
Doing okay?

2780
02:28:17,469 --> 02:28:18,590
My military is almost ready.

2781
02:28:19,309 --> 02:28:21,680
I need more food.

2782
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:22,479
I need another farm.

2783
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:24,000
I need more farms.

2784
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,360
Like more people.

2785
02:28:26,079 --> 02:28:27,899
How are we doing on population?

2786
02:28:27,899 --> 02:28:31,569
Sleep.

2787
02:28:31,569 --> 02:28:32,049
Where's my?

2788
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:33,090
Let's see.

2789
02:28:34,850 --> 02:28:36,049
Birth rate low.

2790
02:28:36,049 --> 02:28:36,290
All right.

2791
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:37,250
We need more fucking.

2792
02:28:37,250 --> 02:28:39,729
They wish to wage war against me.

2793
02:28:40,930 --> 02:28:42,049
So be it.

2794
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:51,889
The pitiful survivors of the Aztec attack will not last long here.

2795
02:28:52,530 --> 02:28:55,979
Stop eating people.

2796
02:28:59,180 --> 02:28:59,340
All right.

2797
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:00,059
We got more breeders.

2798
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:04,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2799
02:29:04,110 --> 02:29:04,430
Stop.

2800
02:29:05,860 --> 02:29:06,500
No, I'm trying to.

2801
02:29:07,549 --> 02:29:09,229
Don't eat a villager.

2802
02:29:11,739 --> 02:29:12,059
Don't.

2803
02:29:12,059 --> 02:29:12,540
Okay.

2804
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:13,340
No villagers.

2805
02:29:13,979 --> 02:29:18,590
I need a new temple.

2806
02:29:18,590 --> 02:29:19,229
What about water?

2807
02:29:19,229 --> 02:29:21,229
That's what you guys doing over here.

2808
02:29:21,229 --> 02:29:22,700
This is doing whole lot of nothing.

2809
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:23,340
All right.

2810
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:23,659
Farms?

2811
02:29:24,219 --> 02:29:25,809
Disciple farmer.

2812
02:29:26,450 --> 02:29:28,030
Let's get a military.

2813
02:29:28,510 --> 02:29:30,639
Disciple farmer.

2814
02:29:30,639 --> 02:29:33,149
How many people can I make here though?

2815
02:29:33,149 --> 02:29:34,989
I don't want to destroy the whole economy.

2816
02:29:35,069 --> 02:29:41,870
to build an army click and drag the army flag

2817
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:44,879

I need more breeders

2823

breeder breeder breeder

2824
02:30:10,739 --> 02:30:12,739
are they waiting to go into the house to breed?

2825
02:30:12,739 --> 02:30:14,739
I don't understand what they're doing

2826
02:30:19,409 --> 02:30:21,409
the greeks have recruited a platoon

2827
02:30:21,409 --> 02:30:23,409
let's see how it

2828
02:30:23,409 --> 02:30:25,409

02:30:25,409 --> 02:30:33,540

2833
02:30:39,950 --> 02:30:41,950

2834
02:30:41,950 --> 02:30:52,639
stray wood everywhere

2835
02:30:52,639 --> 02:30:54,819

2840
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:16,000
I'm going to stomp all over that platoon

2841
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,329
is that what you want?

2842
02:31:19,329 --> 02:31:21,329
is that what you want to do?

2843
02:31:21,329 --> 02:31:28,239
you're okay

2844
02:31:28,239 --> 02:31:30,239

how do I open the door?

2848
02:31:42,270 --> 02:31:44,270
can I open the gate?

2849
02:31:44,270 --> 02:31:46,270
there's no gate here

2850
02:31:46,270 --> 02:31:50,219
can I make a gate?

2851
02:31:50,219 --> 02:31:52,219

2854
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:02,930

02:48:01,489 --> 02:48:03,659
what we were looking for

3094
02:48:03,659 --> 02:48:13,649
they sure aren't changing or improving anything

3095
02:48:13,649 --> 02:48:15,649
really? I don't know

3096
02:48:15,649 --> 02:48:21,280
what's the general consensus on it?

3097
02:48:21,280 --> 02:48:23,280
alright, where's Murius? He's doing alright

3098
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:25,280
keep hanging out over here, how many builders do we have? How many farmers?

3099
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:27,280
what are you up to?

3100
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:29,280
you're just clapping, alright, no clapping

3101
02:48:29,280 --> 02:48:31,280
do that

3102
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:34,420
we need some more breeders

3103
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:40,420
let's go back to my original town over here

3104
02:48:40,420 --> 02:48:43,870
how are we doing?

3105
02:48:43,870 --> 02:48:46,739
more houses

3106
02:48:46,739 --> 02:48:48,739
these people are sleeping outside

3107
02:48:48,739 --> 02:48:51,420
let's do this

3108
02:48:51,420 --> 02:48:53,420
nice

3109
02:48:53,420 --> 02:48:57,200
this is going to be nice

3110
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:01,299
I want every other spot

3111
02:49:01,299 --> 02:49:19,979
like that

3112
02:49:19,979 --> 02:49:21,979
and one, no, two more

3113
02:49:21,979 --> 02:49:30,750
see, now we have a neighborhood

3114
02:49:30,750 --> 02:49:36,559
redeemed to Wink

3115
02:49:36,559 --> 02:49:38,559
sweat check for 75,000 points

3116
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:42,079
let's water

3117
02:49:42,079 --> 02:49:44,639
give me this water

3118
02:49:44,639 --> 02:49:49,059
over here

3119
02:49:49,059 --> 02:49:51,059
give everybody a shower, more food

3120
02:49:51,059 --> 02:49:53,940
we're looking good over here

3121
02:49:53,940 --> 02:50:05,579
I'm going to build all this shit

3122
02:50:05,579 --> 02:50:08,020
you have good taste in hats

3123
02:50:08,020 --> 02:50:10,020
do I? that's good to know

3124
02:50:10,020 --> 02:50:31,569
what do you mean?

3125
02:50:31,569 --> 02:50:33,569
I haven't worn a hat on stream

3126
02:50:33,569 --> 02:50:35,569
on camera in probably like

3127
02:50:35,569 --> 02:50:38,639
a couple years

3128
02:50:38,639 --> 02:50:45,809
what hat are you referring to?

3129
02:50:45,809 --> 02:50:52,399
a fedora? I've never put a fedora

3130
02:50:52,399 --> 02:50:55,219
on my head, once

3131
02:50:55,219 --> 02:50:59,700
ever, I don't think so

3132
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:07,120
I really don't think it's ever happened

3133
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:11,790
green screen stream?

3134
02:51:11,790 --> 02:51:16,780
I don't remember

3135
02:51:23,379 --> 02:51:26,770
where is

3136
02:51:26,770 --> 02:51:28,770
are you coming home? he's coming home

3137
02:51:28,770 --> 02:51:31,010
he's like, I'm sick of this bullshit

3138
02:51:31,010 --> 02:51:34,020
I want to go to sleep

3139
02:51:34,020 --> 02:51:36,020
maybe

3140
02:51:36,020 --> 02:51:40,430
for like a second or two

3141
02:51:40,430 --> 02:51:44,209
this is out of my influence? fuck it is

3142
02:51:44,209 --> 02:51:46,209
he's going back to bed

3143
02:51:46,209 --> 02:51:50,750
I wonder when he's going to grow

3144
02:51:50,750 --> 02:51:53,059
on the slime stream?

3145
02:51:53,059 --> 02:51:57,790
did? did I?

3146
02:52:04,590 --> 02:52:07,899
I guess I did, yeah

3147
02:52:07,899 --> 02:52:13,219
was that really a fedora though?

3148
02:52:13,219 --> 02:52:16,219
alright, let's go back to here

3149
02:52:16,219 --> 02:52:18,219
alright, let's move

3150
02:52:18,219 --> 02:52:20,659
I'm going to build a building down here

3151
02:52:20,659 --> 02:52:24,370
what do they want? temple? sure thing

3152
02:52:24,370 --> 02:52:27,379
let's get it, let's get it down here

3153
02:52:36,049 --> 02:52:38,739
this guy talks a lot of shit

3154
02:52:38,739 --> 02:52:40,739
his army is stuck on the right side of my game

3155
02:52:40,739 --> 02:52:42,909
he's all talk

3156
02:52:42,909 --> 02:52:44,909
he just wants me to walk away

3157
02:52:44,909 --> 02:52:46,909
he wants me to get scared and leave

3158
02:52:46,909 --> 02:52:49,219
he doesn't have shit, he's a liar

3159
02:53:00,739 --> 02:53:03,040
there's a little bit of ore

3160
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:05,040
where are they getting the ore?

3161
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:14,639
more influence

3162
02:53:14,639 --> 02:53:16,639
good, good, good, good, good

3163
02:53:16,639 --> 02:53:22,129
keep going

3164
02:53:22,129 --> 02:53:26,989
more buildings over here

3165
02:53:26,989 --> 02:53:28,989
you already have a store room

3166
02:53:28,989 --> 02:53:33,659
oh, save the game

3167
02:53:33,659 --> 02:53:37,379
woah

3168
02:53:37,379 --> 02:53:39,379
yeah

3169
02:53:39,379 --> 02:53:41,809
yeah, this is

3170
02:53:41,809 --> 02:53:47,760
two full hours have gone by

3171
02:53:47,760 --> 02:53:58,319
alright, let's build

3172
02:53:58,319 --> 02:54:01,069
some fucked up stuff

3173
02:54:01,069 --> 02:54:03,069
altar, field, armoury

3174
02:54:03,069 --> 02:54:05,069
creature pen, I'm going to pull the creature pen up here

3175
02:54:05,069 --> 02:54:08,459
so he has another place to sleep

3176
02:54:08,459 --> 02:54:15,489
that he likes, you know?

3177
02:54:15,489 --> 02:54:22,059
boom

3178
02:54:22,059 --> 02:54:24,059
torture people

3179
02:54:24,059 --> 02:54:32,510
oh, was it fuck it Thursday?

3180
02:54:32,510 --> 02:54:34,510
what is today, Thursday?

3181
02:54:34,510 --> 02:54:38,739
yeah, I have some sun chips

3182
02:54:38,739 --> 02:54:41,040
would you like any?

3183
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:43,040
no, I would not, I would not

3184
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:48,030
I do not find those to be delicious at all

3185
02:54:48,030 --> 02:54:52,129
alright, Marius, follow me

3186
02:54:52,129 --> 02:54:54,559
come up to here

3187
02:54:54,559 --> 02:54:59,299
and here, look, a new house

3188
02:54:59,299 --> 02:55:04,270
take a look, inspect it, check it out

3189
02:55:04,270 --> 02:55:11,700
let me know what you think

3190
02:55:11,700 --> 02:55:13,700
let's move the army

3191
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:16,000
the army is going to

3192
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
I'm going to try to get these people on the left to like me

3193
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,690
I'm going to put these guys over here

3194
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:27,219
because that's where their army is going to be attacking from

3195
02:55:27,219 --> 02:55:29,840
alright, now, it's just as simple as

3196
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:31,840
building more buildings

3197
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:34,659
what do I want, torture pit?

3198
02:55:34,659 --> 02:55:37,540
Dilla, destruction tool

3199
02:55:37,540 --> 02:55:39,540
can I even make a

3200
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:41,840
torture pit?

3201
02:55:41,840 --> 02:55:44,780
poo? I'll poo on the rocks

3202
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:46,780
I'll spend some time playing

3203
02:55:46,780 --> 02:55:53,250
oh, this is his brain

3204
02:55:53,250 --> 02:55:58,930
one man?

3205
02:55:58,930 --> 02:56:00,930
cost five thousand to make somebody?

3206
02:56:00,930 --> 02:56:04,450
teddy bear? a ball?

3207
02:56:04,450 --> 02:56:06,989
a voodoo doll?

3208
02:56:06,989 --> 02:56:09,940
a lamp? punishment spike?

3209
02:56:09,940 --> 02:56:16,590
a good creature toy

3210
02:56:16,590 --> 02:56:18,590
playing with this as an effect on alignment

3211
02:56:18,590 --> 02:56:24,350
shifting towards good

3212
02:56:24,350 --> 02:56:33,489
let's get it, how do you like it?

3213
02:56:33,489 --> 02:56:40,979
check it out, do you like it?

3214
02:56:40,979 --> 02:56:47,760
give it a look, I'm going to play with that toy

3215
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:54,020
he loves it

3216
02:56:54,020 --> 02:57:02,270
he loves it

3217
02:57:02,270 --> 02:57:06,690
hey, don't be so rough

3218
02:57:06,690 --> 02:57:08,690
did you break it?

3219
02:57:08,690 --> 02:57:10,690
he broke it

3220
02:57:16,690 --> 02:57:18,690
he broke it

3221
02:57:18,690 --> 02:57:20,690
he broke it

3222
02:57:20,690 --> 02:57:24,979
did he? where is it?

3223
02:57:24,979 --> 02:57:30,479
the response, okay

3224
02:57:30,479 --> 02:57:32,479
why did he destroy it? whatever, he was just playing with it

3225
02:57:32,479 --> 02:57:38,110
what in punishment spikes?

3226
02:57:38,110 --> 02:57:40,110
no, that's fucked up, I don't want to do that

3227
02:57:40,110 --> 02:57:43,180
alright, what do I want to do?

3228
02:57:43,180 --> 02:57:45,489
do I not have access to

3229
02:57:45,489 --> 02:57:51,760
how come I don't have access to the

3230
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:55,979
torture pit?

3231
02:57:55,979 --> 02:58:00,399
do I need like an altar or something?

3232
02:58:00,399 --> 02:58:02,399
I have all this stuff, don't I?

3233
02:58:02,399 --> 02:58:09,889
I guess I'll put an altar in here

3234
02:58:09,889 --> 02:58:13,649
they don't have one

3235
02:58:17,649 --> 02:58:23,659
you gotta buy it

3236
02:58:23,659 --> 02:58:30,000
and just getting some influence

3237
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:36,020
they have wood in the store room

3238
02:58:36,020 --> 02:58:38,020
so I should probably use the wood in the store room

3239
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:41,340
I'm going to have some fun

3240
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:44,290
playing with that tree

3241
02:58:44,290 --> 02:58:50,180
good, you have to be evil to

3242
02:58:50,180 --> 02:58:52,180
get it

3243
02:58:52,180 --> 02:59:01,389
that makes sense

3244
02:59:01,389 --> 02:59:04,909
let me get some worshippers in here

3245
02:59:04,909 --> 02:59:06,909
I'm going to influence these two and I'm not going to have to do anything

3246
02:59:06,909 --> 02:59:14,079
I'm not going to have to fight anybody

3247
02:59:14,079 --> 02:59:17,790
who's available?

3248
02:59:17,790 --> 02:59:20,610
you are

3249
02:59:20,610 --> 02:59:22,610
you are available

3250
02:59:22,610 --> 02:59:26,639
ready?

3251
02:59:36,239 --> 02:59:38,239
are there any side quests that I missed?

3252
02:59:38,239 --> 02:59:41,760
I haven't seen any

3253
02:59:41,760 --> 02:59:43,760
should I work out using trees?

3254
02:59:43,760 --> 02:59:46,510
yeah, yeah, yeah

3255
02:59:46,510 --> 02:59:48,819
I'm going to, yeah, weight lift the tree

3256
02:59:48,819 --> 02:59:55,600
that's way better than a person

3257
02:59:55,600 --> 02:59:57,600
it weighs like 5,000 times more than a person

3258
02:59:57,600 --> 03:00:08,209
maybe he'll get big

3259
03:00:08,209 --> 03:00:10,209
muscles, alright, let's do another

3260
03:00:10,209 --> 03:00:16,420
more houses, put them down here

3261
03:00:16,420 --> 03:00:18,420
start our influence campaign this way

3262
03:00:18,420 --> 03:00:25,389
and then that way

3263
03:00:25,389 --> 03:00:36,979
get a shit load of wood, put it over here

3264
03:00:36,979 --> 03:00:40,940
why is this evil?

3265
03:00:40,940 --> 03:00:45,090
is he going to lift it?

3266
03:00:45,090 --> 03:00:47,090
do some exercises, you need to get bigger and stronger

3267
03:00:47,090 --> 03:00:56,799
he doesn't get it

3268
03:00:56,799 --> 03:01:01,020
should I eat rocks

3269
03:01:01,020 --> 03:01:03,020
or are they bad for my teeth?

3270
03:01:03,020 --> 03:01:05,020
no, no, no, don't eat rocks

3271
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:07,020
I'm going to eat that rock, don't eat a rock

3272
03:01:07,020 --> 03:01:09,020
no

3273
03:01:09,020 --> 03:01:12,860
no, I'm trying to

3274
03:01:12,860 --> 03:01:15,170
I'm trying to tell you

3275
03:01:15,170 --> 03:01:17,170
don't eat rocks

3276
03:01:19,170 --> 03:01:27,170
oh my god

3277
03:01:27,170 --> 03:01:29,780
don't eat

3278
03:01:29,780 --> 03:01:31,780
rocks

3279
03:01:31,780 --> 03:01:33,780
don't eat rocks

3280
03:01:33,780 --> 03:01:36,340
don't eat rocks

3281
03:01:36,340 --> 03:01:38,340
don't eat rocks

3282
03:01:38,340 --> 03:01:40,340
don't eat rocks

3283
03:01:40,340 --> 03:01:43,860
I'm trying to be gentle

3284
03:01:43,860 --> 03:01:50,579
don't eat rocks

3285
03:01:50,579 --> 03:01:53,459
eat food

3286
03:01:53,459 --> 03:01:55,459
I wonder if I could fit that toy in my mouth

3287
03:02:02,350 --> 03:02:04,350
I wonder if I could fit the toy

3288
03:02:04,350 --> 03:02:06,350
in my mouth

3289
03:02:06,350 --> 03:02:08,350
sentences said before disaster

3290
03:02:08,350 --> 03:02:12,579
he lost track

3291
03:02:12,579 --> 03:02:20,379
of what he was doing

3292
03:02:20,379 --> 03:02:22,879
let him learn

3293
03:02:22,879 --> 03:02:25,819
we're going to be at the doctor

3294
03:02:25,819 --> 03:02:29,149
he's going to end up with a marble in his nose

3295
03:02:31,149 --> 03:02:37,549
even more

3296
03:02:37,549 --> 03:02:39,729
let's keep going

3297
03:02:39,729 --> 03:02:41,729
I don't know

3298
03:02:41,729 --> 03:02:50,540
armory, put it back a little

3299
03:02:50,540 --> 03:02:53,360
oh yes

3300
03:02:53,360 --> 03:02:55,360
armory's turned weedy men into

3301
03:02:55,360 --> 03:02:57,790
warriors

3302
03:02:57,790 --> 03:02:59,790
I need the wood

3303
03:02:59,790 --> 03:03:01,790
I need 500 ore

3304
03:03:03,790 --> 03:03:07,229
how's eat rocks

3305
03:03:07,229 --> 03:03:09,229
good for their digestion, I don't think that's real

3306
03:03:09,229 --> 03:03:12,750
I think what you're saying is inaccurate

3307
03:03:12,750 --> 03:03:18,770
keep it going

3308
03:03:18,770 --> 03:03:26,899
I'm slowly going to encroach

3309
03:03:26,899 --> 03:03:28,899
I'm just building power plants up into their base

3310
03:03:28,899 --> 03:03:48,219
do the quests

3311
03:03:48,219 --> 03:03:51,420
I was trying to look and see if there are any on the

3312
03:03:51,420 --> 03:03:54,239
oh you're talking about just like little tasks

3313
03:03:54,239 --> 03:03:56,239
at the top left

3314
03:03:56,239 --> 03:03:59,500
let's check it out, let's see what they are

3315
03:03:59,500 --> 03:04:02,129
what do they got for us

3316
03:04:02,129 --> 03:04:07,760
how do I see the tasks

3317
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:17,870
dwellings

3318
03:04:17,870 --> 03:04:19,870
civic buildings

3319
03:04:19,870 --> 03:04:21,870
how do I see the

3320
03:04:21,870 --> 03:04:26,739
tasks

3321
03:04:26,739 --> 03:04:32,180
they pop up sometimes

3322
03:04:32,180 --> 03:04:35,700
oh shit

3323
03:04:35,700 --> 03:04:38,059
eat some food, you can have food

3324
03:04:38,059 --> 03:04:40,059
don't feel like you're stealing

3325
03:04:40,059 --> 03:04:43,329
you can have as much as you want

3326
03:04:43,329 --> 03:04:51,010
I need ore, is this ore

3327
03:04:51,010 --> 03:04:53,250
there's no ore over there

3328
03:04:53,250 --> 03:05:00,270
I have to take some from here

3329
03:05:00,270 --> 03:05:02,270
wait 500

3330
03:05:02,270 --> 03:05:06,940
that's enough

3331
03:05:06,940 --> 03:05:10,270
where's my mouse

3332
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:19,200
keep that influence going

3333
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:21,819
what do you guys think about me now

3334
03:05:21,819 --> 03:05:26,670
that's what you think

3335
03:05:29,100 --> 03:05:33,260
where's my army

3336
03:05:33,260 --> 03:05:35,260
I'm going to have two armies

3337
03:05:35,260 --> 03:05:42,239
do I not have enough men

3338
03:05:42,239 --> 03:05:50,940
I don't have enough men

3339
03:05:50,940 --> 03:05:55,090
shit

3340
03:05:55,090 --> 03:05:57,090
we need to do some breeding

3341
03:06:02,909 --> 03:06:05,469
peace through power

3342
03:06:05,469 --> 03:06:07,469
peace with power

3343
03:06:07,469 --> 03:06:09,469
I'm going to try

3344
03:06:09,469 --> 03:06:11,469
but

3345
03:06:11,469 --> 03:06:14,540
is it going to really do much

3346
03:06:14,540 --> 03:06:16,540
what are you doing

3347
03:06:16,540 --> 03:06:20,370
get out of there

3348
03:06:20,370 --> 03:06:22,370
eat some food, I'll give it to you

3349
03:06:22,370 --> 03:06:27,940
eat that

3350
03:06:27,940 --> 03:06:33,360
eat it

3351
03:06:33,360 --> 03:06:35,360
you know you want to, here

3352
03:06:35,360 --> 03:06:41,940
it's delicious

3353
03:06:41,940 --> 03:06:43,940
it smells good

3354
03:06:43,940 --> 03:06:45,940
eat it

3355
03:06:45,940 --> 03:06:47,940
should I beat up those animals

3356
03:06:47,940 --> 03:06:52,479
what animals

3357
03:06:52,479 --> 03:06:55,489
there are no animals here

3358
03:06:55,489 --> 03:06:58,239
beat up an animal, where's an animal

3359
03:06:58,239 --> 03:07:23,010
oh the rabbit

3360
03:07:23,010 --> 03:07:25,379
what a dick

3361
03:07:25,379 --> 03:07:27,379
if you're hungry eat

3362
03:07:27,379 --> 03:07:29,379
where are you putting wood over here

3363
03:07:29,379 --> 03:07:31,940
there's no reason for him to do this

3364
03:07:31,940 --> 03:07:35,069
I'm going to gather wood

3365
03:07:35,069 --> 03:07:38,659
good work

3366
03:07:38,659 --> 03:07:40,659
I'm going to play with the villager

3367
03:07:40,659 --> 03:07:42,659
he's just taking wood from the storehouse

3368
03:07:42,659 --> 03:07:48,989
I'm putting it outside the storehouse

3369
03:07:48,989 --> 03:07:55,389
he's alive

3370
03:07:55,389 --> 03:07:57,389
let's keep going

3371
03:07:57,389 --> 03:07:59,819
I was doing breeding

3372
03:07:59,819 --> 03:08:02,190
do I have enough

3373
03:08:02,190 --> 03:08:05,629
available men

3374
03:08:05,629 --> 03:08:07,629
let's go with

3375
03:08:07,629 --> 03:08:10,899
platoon size

3376
03:08:10,899 --> 03:08:16,700
10

3377
03:08:16,700 --> 03:08:18,700
they're right here

3378
03:08:18,700 --> 03:08:21,329
I don't think he even has a creature

3379
03:08:21,329 --> 03:08:24,399
does he have a creature

3380
03:08:24,399 --> 03:08:28,180
10 in here

3381
03:08:28,180 --> 03:08:30,180
he does, where is it

3382
03:08:30,180 --> 03:08:33,950
I haven't seen it once

3383
03:08:33,950 --> 03:08:38,819
curious I need you over here

3384
03:08:38,819 --> 03:08:40,819
what do you have, put it down

3385
03:08:40,819 --> 03:08:43,950
rabbit, wait what are you doing with this

3386
03:08:43,950 --> 03:08:45,950
I'm kind of curious actually

3387
03:08:45,950 --> 03:08:49,409
bringing it back to the house

3388
03:08:59,120 --> 03:09:01,120
there's just trees

3389
03:09:01,120 --> 03:09:04,639
there's just trees in here

3390
03:09:04,639 --> 03:09:06,639
I'm going to keep him in there

3391
03:09:06,639 --> 03:09:08,639
because he keeps putting them in

3392
03:09:08,639 --> 03:09:10,639
I'm just going to let him

3393
03:09:10,639 --> 03:09:12,639
I'm going to let him keep doing

3394
03:09:12,639 --> 03:09:14,639
what did he just do

3395
03:09:14,639 --> 03:09:16,639
he just screamed at him

3396
03:09:16,639 --> 03:09:20,860
he's so fucked up

3397
03:09:20,860 --> 03:09:25,409
okay watch

3398
03:09:25,409 --> 03:09:27,409
he's just

3399
03:09:27,409 --> 03:09:29,409
I'm going to let him keep fucking doing this

3400
03:09:29,409 --> 03:09:31,409
he's going to keep putting trees in his house

3401
03:09:31,409 --> 03:09:34,219
until it's impossible to walk

3402
03:09:34,219 --> 03:09:39,149
I'm going to just let him be a weirdo

3403
03:09:39,149 --> 03:09:47,340
but more importantly

3404
03:09:47,340 --> 03:09:50,670
come here

3405
03:09:50,670 --> 03:09:52,670

let's make a move

3409
03:10:09,649 --> 03:10:20,340
level 2, attach him to the arm, he's not going to attack them right

3410
03:10:20,340 --> 03:10:22,700
the morale has been increased

3411
03:10:22,700 --> 03:10:29,420

03:10:29,420 --> 03:10:31,420
battle cry, let's get in there

alright is he going to capture

3446
03:12:50,299 --> 03:12:53,309
I don't think he can

03:12:53,309 --> 03:12:56,319
I don't even know what to say

3448
03:12:56,319 --> 03:12:58,319
I'm going to build that structure

3449
03:12:58,319 --> 03:13:00,319

3450
03:13:00,319 --> 03:13:02,319

these folks

3456
03:13:20,930 --> 03:13:22,930
yes, yes you should entertain them

3457
03:13:22,930 --> 03:13:25,100
entertain them while we

3458
03:13:25,100 --> 03:13:34,319
conquer them

3459
03:13:34,319 --> 03:13:46,290
entertain them, this doesn't seem very

3460
03:13:46,290 --> 03:13:49,040
entertaining

3461
03:13:49,040 --> 03:13:57,680

3622
03:27:52,510 --> 03:28:00,370

these guys are still just walking around

3645
03:29:15,920 --> 03:29:17,920
it's

3646
03:29:17,920 --> 03:29:20,739
maybe daytime, let's go

3647
03:29:20,739 --> 03:29:25,340
everybody out, they've been there the whole game

3648
03:29:25,340 --> 03:29:28,610
to invent fortnite

3649
03:29:28,610 --> 03:29:34,110
to gain followers

3650
03:29:34,110 --> 03:29:36,110
I'm gonna keep working up over here, wait

3651
03:29:36,110 --> 03:29:39,309
there's a little town right here

3652
03:29:39,309 --> 03:29:41,309
there's a humdigger of a fight going on

3653
03:29:41,309 --> 03:29:47,520
what, where

3654
03:29:47,520 --> 03:29:50,590
oh, right here, here he is

3655
03:29:50,590 --> 03:29:58,510
soldier mode, come on

3656
03:29:58,510 --> 03:30:00,510
you can take him on by yourself, we gotta get

3657
03:30:00,510 --> 03:30:04,739
I have to get rid of this villager

3658
03:30:04,739 --> 03:30:06,739
why would you ever do this without your creature, knowing that I have one down here

3659
03:30:14,079 --> 03:30:17,409
start eating people

3660
03:30:17,409 --> 03:30:19,649
a huge soccer kick

3661
03:30:19,649 --> 03:30:21,649
watch out for the buildings, watch out for the other people

3662
03:30:23,649 --> 03:30:28,000
now he just scratches his ass

3663
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:33,569
why is he so itchy

3664
03:30:33,569 --> 03:30:47,760
back to free will

3665
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:49,760
I wonder, what should I do with this guy

3666
03:30:51,760 --> 03:30:54,059
bathe him, he'll be alright

3667
03:30:54,059 --> 03:30:58,659
I'm gonna go

3668
03:30:58,659 --> 03:31:00,659
I gotta get this right now, ok I just destroyed

3669
03:31:00,659 --> 03:31:03,600
all this shit

3670
03:31:03,600 --> 03:31:05,600
I'm gonna capture it with mirror, I'm just gonna take this one guy

3671
03:31:05,600 --> 03:31:07,600
I don't think the speed

3672
03:31:07,600 --> 03:31:09,600
capture speed goes anything

3673
03:31:09,600 --> 03:31:11,600
are they all clapping and happy about the shit all over the ground

3674
03:31:11,600 --> 03:31:13,600
probably, it's weird

3675
03:31:13,600 --> 03:31:16,290
alright we're gonna go in and

3676
03:31:16,290 --> 03:31:18,290
capture this

3677
03:31:20,290 --> 03:31:22,909
hang out right here, I'm curious, go kill everybody

3678
03:31:22,909 --> 03:31:29,700
let's take this, we're gonna take this by force too

3679
03:31:29,700 --> 03:31:34,430
he's got one more group

3680
03:31:34,430 --> 03:31:38,139
and then I got one guy

3681
03:31:38,139 --> 03:31:40,139
I can just capture the whole thing, don't matter

3682
03:31:40,139 --> 03:31:47,120
this thing's growing too

3683
03:31:47,120 --> 03:31:55,500
he looks bigger than he does before

3684
03:31:55,500 --> 03:31:57,500
you go in there and take care of that

3685
03:31:57,500 --> 03:31:59,870
you

3686
03:31:59,870 --> 03:32:03,389
capture it

3687
03:32:05,389 --> 03:32:14,079
evil

3688
03:32:14,079 --> 03:32:16,770
evil

3689
03:32:16,770 --> 03:32:20,670
alright, now just stay here

3690
03:32:20,670 --> 03:32:23,100
watch the punch

3691
03:32:23,100 --> 03:32:30,510
jump on him

3692
03:32:30,510 --> 03:32:32,879
jump on him

3693
03:32:34,879 --> 03:32:42,620
stay here

3694
03:32:42,620 --> 03:32:44,620
take it over, no other armies

3695
03:32:44,620 --> 03:32:46,620
there's an army coming right here, but we should be able to defend this

3696
03:32:46,620 --> 03:32:48,860
in the meantime, hold on, I'm gonna send

3697
03:32:48,860 --> 03:32:50,860
some support

3698
03:32:50,860 --> 03:32:54,959
do I have any support? I have these guys

3699
03:32:54,959 --> 03:32:57,329
what the fuck was that

3700
03:32:57,329 --> 03:33:00,079
it was like a gunshot

3701
03:33:00,079 --> 03:33:02,079
okay, it's kicking a building

3702
03:33:02,079 --> 03:33:09,549
are they coming down here?

3703
03:33:09,549 --> 03:33:13,200
do the scroll quest? I haven't seen any

3704
03:33:13,200 --> 03:33:15,700
I don't see any scrolls

3705
03:33:15,700 --> 03:33:22,479
on the map, have you guys seen any?

3706
03:33:22,479 --> 03:33:32,780
I haven't seen one, oh there's one right here, okay

3707
03:33:32,780 --> 03:33:38,739
help us

3708
03:33:38,739 --> 03:33:40,739
we need to finish our special brew

3709
03:33:40,739 --> 03:33:42,739
throw this barrel to my

3710
03:33:42,739 --> 03:33:44,739
brother over there so he can add his ingredient

3711
03:33:44,739 --> 03:33:46,739
then throw it to my other brother

3712
03:33:46,739 --> 03:33:48,739
on the next island

3713
03:33:48,739 --> 03:33:50,739
it needs to go to them all in turn

3714
03:33:50,739 --> 03:33:52,739
until our brew is finished

3715
03:33:52,739 --> 03:33:55,549
barrel throwing quest?

3716
03:33:55,549 --> 03:34:14,879

3718
03:34:18,190 --> 03:34:28,430

03:34:48,270 --> 03:34:52,500
is, I don't understand

3721
03:34:52,500 --> 03:34:56,909
why can I pick up the

3722
03:34:56,909 --> 03:34:58,909

3723
03:34:58,909 --> 03:35:01,729
throw, well, I

3724
03:35:01,729 --> 03:35:05,059

3725
03:35:05,059 --> 03:35:08,319
I mean

3726
03:35:08,319 --> 03:35:10,940
did you get it?

3727
03:35:10,940 --> 03:35:33,459
throw it back

3728
03:35:33,459 --> 03:35:43,889
no, throw it over here

3729
03:35:43,889 --> 03:35:51,819
okay, it's the game, come on

3730
03:35:51,819 --> 03:35:53,819

3737
03:36:10,860 --> 03:36:18,100
oh, this is so fucking finicky

3738
03:36:18,100 --> 03:36:21,940
holy shit, come on

3739
03:36:21,940 --> 03:36:23,940
I

3740
03:36:23,940 --> 03:36:40,100
I did it, hold on

3741
03:36:40,100 --> 03:36:52,129
not again, right?

3742
03:36:57,700 --> 03:36:59,940
I'm just waiting for Murius

3743
03:36:59,940 --> 03:37:01,940
to come over and just fucking eat this guy

3744
03:37:01,940 --> 03:37:10,959
in the middle of a cutscene

3745
03:37:10,959 --> 03:37:12,959
I just want something to happen

3746
03:37:12,959 --> 03:37:15,579
all right, so now we're going from

3747
03:37:15,579 --> 03:37:17,579
oh my goodness, we're going from here

3748
03:37:17,579 --> 03:37:19,579
we have to throw it across the whole thing

3749
03:37:19,579 --> 03:37:22,659
oh, this is gonna actually

3750
03:37:22,659 --> 03:37:24,659
suck, okay, so

3751
03:37:24,659 --> 03:37:28,299
I hear

3752
03:37:28,299 --> 03:37:30,299
Murius is kicking shit

3753
03:37:30,299 --> 03:37:33,500
okay, so now let's go from

3754
03:37:33,500 --> 03:37:45,899
this is

3755
03:37:45,899 --> 03:37:56,719
what's up with the ticking?

3756
03:37:56,719 --> 03:37:59,920
I'm ticking over a town

3757
03:37:59,920 --> 03:38:02,100
currently ticking over a town

3758
03:38:02,100 --> 03:38:05,809
Murius is kicking shit

3759
03:38:05,809 --> 03:38:10,350
sweet

3760
03:38:10,350 --> 03:38:12,350
praise be, the brew is finished

3761
03:38:12,350 --> 03:38:14,350
let's drink it, lads

3762
03:38:14,350 --> 03:38:16,350
but first, a tribute

3763
03:38:16,350 --> 03:38:18,350
to our benefactor

3764
03:38:18,350 --> 03:38:24,159
hooray

3765
03:38:24,159 --> 03:38:26,159
yeah, I got one guy taking a town over

3766
03:38:26,159 --> 03:38:29,489
currently, wrong button

3767
03:38:29,489 --> 03:38:32,239
I was trying to press this button

3768
03:38:32,239 --> 03:38:34,670
I thought that was the camera button

3769
03:38:34,670 --> 03:38:39,260
to the same spot

3770
03:38:39,260 --> 03:38:48,420
where the camera button usually is

3771
03:38:48,420 --> 03:38:50,420
is this where I guess it was?

3772
03:38:50,420 --> 03:38:53,620
20,000 points

3773
03:38:53,620 --> 03:38:55,620
all right, now, Murius, where are you?

3774
03:38:55,620 --> 03:38:58,860
I'm soaking

3775
03:38:58,860 --> 03:39:00,860
good, and you need to take this place open, you need to hang out

3776
03:39:00,860 --> 03:39:05,469
oh, he's wrecking this place

3777
03:39:05,469 --> 03:39:07,469
all right, you don't need to wreck this place

3778
03:39:07,469 --> 03:39:09,469
just be an entertainer for a little while

3779
03:39:09,469 --> 03:39:14,209
entertain this person

3780
03:39:14,209 --> 03:39:16,209
that's the last person that you haven't killed

3781
03:39:25,360 --> 03:39:34,129
I'm so happy

3782
03:39:34,129 --> 03:39:36,129
evil, evil, evil

3783
03:39:36,129 --> 03:39:44,700
this is still working

3784
03:39:44,700 --> 03:39:46,700
boy, are they rebuilding the town as he destroys it?

3785
03:39:46,700 --> 03:39:48,700
that's kind of fucked up

3786
03:39:48,700 --> 03:39:51,579
well, he's on happy mode

3787
03:39:51,579 --> 03:39:56,700
so

3788
03:39:56,700 --> 03:39:58,700
yes, hi, I see you, hello

3789
03:39:58,700 --> 03:40:02,530
wait, what is that?

3790
03:40:02,530 --> 03:40:06,430
is that the pot?

3791
03:40:06,430 --> 03:40:09,379
I guess not, I almost have it

3792
03:40:09,379 --> 03:40:17,100
I think peekaboo

3793
03:40:17,100 --> 03:40:19,100
first thing that's getting built here is a creature town

3794
03:40:19,100 --> 03:40:26,909
well, it's a pot market

3795
03:40:26,909 --> 03:40:37,409
how come I can't build a pot market?

3796
03:40:41,409 --> 03:40:44,030
all right, you can hang, I need a creature

3797
03:40:44,030 --> 03:40:46,030
city, second, this is ready

3798
03:40:46,030 --> 03:40:49,040
no, no, don't, no

3799
03:40:49,040 --> 03:40:51,040
Murius, no, no, no, no, put him down, put him down

3800
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:53,040
I need this guy, no, put him down, no, no, no

3801
03:40:53,040 --> 03:40:55,040
put him down, put him down, put him down

3802
03:40:55,040 --> 03:41:00,540
put him down, put him down, put him down

3803
03:41:00,540 --> 03:41:02,540
I got it, okay, I got it

3804
03:41:02,540 --> 03:41:04,540
put him down

3805
03:41:04,540 --> 03:41:06,540
put him down

3806
03:41:06,540 --> 03:41:08,540
put him down, put him down, put him down

3807
03:41:08,540 --> 03:41:10,540
I got the town, right? Okay

3808
03:41:10,540 --> 03:41:13,549
I was gonna say, that's the only guy capturing the city

3809
03:41:13,549 --> 03:41:15,549
no, you don't have to play with the villager, just relax

3810
03:41:15,549 --> 03:41:22,020
I need a creature den

3811
03:41:22,020 --> 03:41:29,819
put you anywhere

3812
03:41:29,819 --> 03:41:35,899
help me build this building, Murius

3813
03:41:35,899 --> 03:41:38,530
they don't have shit though, they have nothing

3814
03:41:38,530 --> 03:41:40,770
they have a little bit of wood

3815
03:41:40,770 --> 03:41:53,549
actually, they got quite a bit

3816
03:41:53,549 --> 03:41:55,549
good, gather

3817
03:41:55,549 --> 03:41:57,549
fields

3818
03:41:57,549 --> 03:42:00,299
good job, Murius, we need to maybe rebuild some of this stuff

3819
03:42:00,299 --> 03:42:02,299
how are the townspeople doing? breed

3820
03:42:04,299 --> 03:42:08,139
any forests around here?

3821
03:42:08,139 --> 03:42:10,139
I need a mine

3822
03:42:10,139 --> 03:42:12,139
you can get this

3823
03:42:12,139 --> 03:42:15,069
I'm kind of evil

3824
03:42:15,069 --> 03:42:17,069
only that? 7% is not bad

3825
03:42:17,069 --> 03:42:24,690

3850
03:43:46,299 --> 03:43:51,420
grain in his hands?

3851
03:43:51,420 --> 03:43:53,420

3852
03:43:53,420 --> 03:43:55,420

all right, pick up tree, throw tree

3855
03:44:10,239 --> 03:44:13,180

03:44:13,180 --> 03:44:15,180
all right, throw, throw at them

3857
03:44:15,180 --> 03:44:26,819
crush them

3858
03:44:26,819 --> 03:44:32,000
can he reach from here?

3859
03:44:34,430 --> 03:44:36,739

3860
03:44:36,739 --> 03:44:46,780

holy shit, he does use it

3863
03:44:52,559 --> 03:44:54,559
he uses it as a fucking weapon

3864
03:44:54,559 --> 03:45:09,840
run him out of town

3865
03:45:09,840 --> 03:45:11,840
holy shit, that's so dangerous

3866
03:45:11,840 --> 03:45:13,840
that's so dangerous, get him out of here

3867
03:45:13,840 --> 03:45:18,319
get him out, get him out

3868
03:45:18,319 --> 03:45:26,319
he's gonna kill everybody

3869
03:45:30,879 --> 03:45:32,879
go after them

3870
03:45:32,879 --> 03:45:34,879

3871
03:45:34,879 --> 03:45:42,989
where?

3872
03:45:42,989 --> 03:45:44,989
where, what, I don't understand, where am I getting attacked?

3873
03:45:44,989 --> 03:45:49,280
all right, just throw it

3874
03:45:49,280 --> 03:45:55,940

where was this other attack going on?

3879
03:46:11,969 --> 03:46:16,190
I think it's only just right here

3880
03:46:16,190 --> 03:46:18,190
throw downhill, he wouldn't throw it

3881
03:46:18,190 --> 03:46:22,290
there was nothing to throw

3882
03:46:22,290 --> 03:46:24,290
they're just running away from it

3883
03:46:24,290 --> 03:46:32,100
Murius, Murius, Murius

3884
03:46:32,100 --> 03:46:34,100

03:46:38,100 --> 03:46:41,299
all right, pick up a fucking tree

3886
03:46:41,299 --> 03:46:43,860
I'm gonna throw it

3887
03:46:43,860 --> 03:46:45,860
how do you throw something, throw

3888
03:46:45,860 --> 03:46:49,569
all right, throw it, throw

3889
03:46:49,569 --> 03:47:01,389
get it again

3890
03:47:01,389 --> 03:47:03,889

3891
03:47:03,889 --> 03:47:17,260
all right, we're gonna throw it downhill

3892
03:47:17,260 --> 03:47:19,260
no, he's got a fucking piece of grain

3893
03:47:19,260 --> 03:47:27,139
kill them

3894
03:47:27,139 --> 03:47:32,959
oh my god

3895
03:47:32,959 --> 03:47:34,959
Murius, what the fuck are you doing?

3896
03:47:34,959 --> 03:47:39,950
they're like dragging him

3897
03:47:39,950 --> 03:47:42,260
finally

3898
03:47:42,260 --> 03:47:44,260
you stepped on somebody

3899
03:47:44,260 --> 03:47:52,239
he'll kill them eventually

3900
03:47:52,239 --> 03:47:57,420
what was I doing?

3901
03:47:57,420 --> 03:47:59,420
the town is coming under attack

3902
03:47:59,420 --> 03:48:01,420
the Aztecs want to rule

3903
03:48:01,420 --> 03:48:03,420
they need the Greeks destroyed

3904
03:48:03,420 --> 03:48:08,209
how do I throw?

3905
03:48:08,209 --> 03:48:10,209
I can't change the throw

3906
03:48:16,290 --> 03:48:18,290
throw, this hurt somebody

3907
03:48:18,290 --> 03:48:20,290
do something Murius

3908
03:48:20,290 --> 03:48:30,459
you're fucking killing me

3909
03:48:30,459 --> 03:48:32,459
you gotta do something

3910
03:48:32,459 --> 03:48:34,459
don't I have an army?

3911
03:48:34,459 --> 03:48:37,020
do I have to make a new army?

3912
03:48:37,020 --> 03:48:39,020
attack, attack, attack

3913
03:48:39,020 --> 03:48:45,979
he killed somebody

3914
03:48:45,979 --> 03:48:47,979
he's just wrecking this town too

3915
03:48:47,979 --> 03:48:50,739
just defend this area

3916
03:48:50,739 --> 03:48:52,739
there's no reason for you to run around in circles

3917
03:48:52,739 --> 03:48:55,040
just defend, defend

3918
03:48:55,040 --> 03:48:57,790
I'm gonna go get my actual army

3919
03:48:57,790 --> 03:48:59,790
there's a home digger of a fight going on

3920
03:48:59,790 --> 03:49:03,120
no there's not

3921
03:49:03,120 --> 03:49:05,120
give me my actual fucking army and just defend over here

3922
03:49:05,120 --> 03:49:10,180
ready to go

3923
03:49:10,180 --> 03:49:13,950
just, don't get them please

3924
03:49:13,950 --> 03:49:55,469
defend the town

3925
03:49:55,469 --> 03:49:58,739
defend the town

3926
03:49:58,739 --> 03:50:00,739
being a soldier, do something

3927
03:50:00,739 --> 03:50:07,389
they just run in and run out

3928
03:50:07,389 --> 03:50:10,020
Murius, get them

3929
03:50:10,020 --> 03:50:14,750
get them

3930
03:50:14,750 --> 03:50:20,579
alright, my actual team is here

3931
03:50:20,579 --> 03:50:25,629
this is like the stupidest army ever

3932
03:50:25,629 --> 03:50:27,629
they're just running in circles

3933
03:50:27,629 --> 03:50:31,020
absolutely decimated

3934
03:50:31,020 --> 03:50:39,540
just decimated

3935
03:50:39,540 --> 03:50:41,899
time for a counter attack

3936
03:50:43,899 --> 03:50:45,899
every time we do

3937
03:50:45,899 --> 03:50:47,899
Greeks are a strong force

3938
03:50:47,899 --> 03:50:51,299
I cannot tolerate these Greeks any longer

3939
03:50:51,299 --> 03:50:53,299
let's go

3940
03:50:53,299 --> 03:50:56,879
I will have to act

3941
03:50:56,879 --> 03:50:58,879
Murius

3942
03:50:58,879 --> 03:51:00,879
this is North's land

3943
03:51:00,879 --> 03:51:04,780
no intruders must be allowed

3944
03:51:04,780 --> 03:51:06,780
free will, he's alright

3945
03:51:06,780 --> 03:51:10,750
instead of wink it's turning into just like

3946
03:51:10,750 --> 03:51:23,920
stay together

3947
03:51:23,920 --> 03:51:25,920
it's time to go kill this motherfucker

3948
03:51:25,920 --> 03:51:31,040
he's streaming in a cave

3949
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:33,040
yes, yes

3950
03:51:33,040 --> 03:51:48,450
you know what, sleep for now

3951
03:51:48,450 --> 03:51:53,950
you guys hang out here for a little bit

3952
03:51:53,950 --> 03:51:58,110
this should be enough to take the other city

3953
03:51:58,110 --> 03:52:01,379
what else do we got?

3954
03:52:01,379 --> 03:52:03,379
take a little rest

3955
03:52:03,379 --> 03:52:05,379
let's get some food for Murius

3956
03:52:05,379 --> 03:52:08,129
and then we're gonna go in

3957
03:52:08,129 --> 03:52:10,129
this is his stronghold here

3958
03:52:10,129 --> 03:52:14,350
he does have

3959
03:52:14,350 --> 03:52:16,350
look at how much of a little baby this is though

3960
03:52:16,350 --> 03:52:18,350
Murius is going to

3961
03:52:18,350 --> 03:52:20,350
karate chop this guy in the head

3962
03:52:20,350 --> 03:52:22,350
and instantly knock him out

3963
03:52:22,350 --> 03:52:34,129
this is gonna be awesome

3964
03:52:34,129 --> 03:52:36,129
he doesn't stand a chance

3965
03:52:36,129 --> 03:52:39,579
I got like 5 towns

3966
03:52:39,579 --> 03:52:46,430

3969
03:52:50,430 --> 03:52:52,989
can they like rest?

3970
03:52:52,989 --> 03:52:54,989
is there a way to like heal them

3971
03:52:54,989 --> 03:52:56,989

3972
03:52:56,989 --> 03:53:03,520

3997
03:54:46,850 --> 03:54:58,430

4013
03:56:02,750 --> 03:56:04,750

4014
03:56:04,750 --> 03:56:07,629

4017
03:56:14,860 --> 03:56:16,860
you're supposed to raise morale not start fighting

4018
03:56:25,600 --> 03:56:29,170
take it

4019
03:56:29,170 --> 03:56:31,600

4020
03:56:31,600 --> 03:56:33,600
alright Murius, it's time for you to get in there because we've got

4021
03:56:33,600 --> 03:56:37,059
we've got a creature up here

4022
03:56:37,059 --> 03:56:39,059
should I try to be friends with the creature

4023
03:56:39,059 --> 03:56:41,059
should I distract the creature, what do you think

4024
03:56:41,059 --> 03:56:48,030
entertain the creature

4025
03:56:48,030 --> 03:56:50,030
kill the other creature

4026
03:56:55,329 --> 03:56:59,360
get a rock, another fight right here

4027
03:56:59,360 --> 03:57:03,899
you can't do that, pick up the small one

4028
03:57:03,899 --> 03:57:13,809
get it, pick it up

4029
03:57:13,809 --> 03:57:15,809

4032
03:57:24,239 --> 03:57:27,120

03:57:29,120 --> 03:57:35,120
stomp

4035
03:57:35,120 --> 03:57:37,120

4037
03:57:40,000 --> 03:57:50,049

4038
03:57:50,049 --> 03:57:53,500
we'll get this last town

4039
03:57:53,500 --> 03:57:55,500
I'm going to do another war factory

4040
03:57:55,500 --> 03:57:57,500
it's not command and conquer but whatever

4041
03:57:57,500 --> 03:58:05,229
stomp

4042
03:58:05,229 --> 03:58:10,159

4043
03:58:10,159 --> 03:58:12,159

4051
03:58:52,239 --> 03:58:54,860
oh my god there's a lot of people

4052
03:58:54,860 --> 03:58:57,040
I'm angry

4053
03:58:57,040 --> 03:59:00,370
take it out

4054
03:59:00,370 --> 03:59:02,370
oh shit, how much health does he have

4055
03:59:02,370 --> 03:59:09,659
get in there, are you okay

4056
03:59:09,659 --> 03:59:12,350
62 health, he's okay

4057
03:59:12,350 --> 03:59:18,370
good, get in here

4058
03:59:18,370 --> 03:59:20,860
these are the ones you have to worry about

4059
03:59:20,860 --> 03:59:24,319
there's so many

4060
03:59:24,319 --> 03:59:31,469
well okay

4061
03:59:31,469 --> 03:59:42,799
Murius

4062
04:00:18,209 --> 04:00:23,700
how does he get up

4063
04:00:23,700 --> 04:00:26,000
fuck, I thought I wasn't going to be able to get it

4064
04:00:26,000 --> 04:00:28,000
what are they doing, don't get your hands off him

4065
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:31,139
don't touch him, he's dead

4066
04:00:31,139 --> 04:00:34,379
no he's not dead

4067
04:00:34,379 --> 04:00:48,459
he's dead

4068
04:00:48,459 --> 04:00:55,889
where's that army, he just made a huge one

4069
04:00:55,889 --> 04:00:58,579
good, come on

4070
04:00:58,579 --> 04:01:12,979
how do I bring him back

4071
04:01:12,979 --> 04:01:14,979
he used to just kind of respawn in the last one

4072
04:01:14,979 --> 04:01:16,979
he's not respawning

4073
04:01:16,979 --> 04:01:37,809
wait, he's back

4074
04:01:37,809 --> 04:01:39,809
he's fatter than ever

4075
04:01:39,809 --> 04:01:48,430
perfect, come with me

4076
04:01:48,430 --> 04:02:07,569
take out your anger up here

4077
04:02:07,569 --> 04:02:12,239
shorter, I think he may have grown up

4078
04:02:12,239 --> 04:02:22,739
he looks a little older

4079
04:02:22,739 --> 04:02:26,000
do they have a creature down here, no they don't

4080
04:02:26,000 --> 04:02:29,459
no, I got free will, he's fine

4081
04:02:29,459 --> 04:02:31,459
his free will is disappearing

4082
04:02:31,459 --> 04:02:33,459
he's fine, he's fine

4083
04:02:33,459 --> 04:02:42,030
free will

4084
04:02:42,030 --> 04:02:46,700
you can just kind of walk around and look at stuff

4085
04:02:46,700 --> 04:02:48,700
I'm going to stomp all over that

4086
04:02:48,700 --> 04:02:51,389
platoon

4087
04:02:51,389 --> 04:02:53,389
that's his free will

4088
04:02:53,389 --> 04:02:55,389
he's angry

4089
04:03:01,219 --> 04:03:03,219
that's his free will, I didn't tell him to do this

4090
04:03:03,219 --> 04:03:11,280
I'm going to

4091
04:03:11,280 --> 04:03:13,280
break down those walls

4092
04:03:13,280 --> 04:03:15,280
Murius, wait

4093
04:03:15,280 --> 04:03:17,280
Murius, Murius

4094
04:03:17,280 --> 04:03:19,280
Murius

4095
04:03:19,280 --> 04:03:21,280
Murius

4096
04:03:21,280 --> 04:03:23,280
he's lost control

4097
04:03:27,280 --> 04:03:32,829
I'm going to

4098
04:03:32,829 --> 04:03:43,180
what town, what town is under attack

4099
04:03:43,180 --> 04:03:51,120
do you see a town under attack

4100
04:03:59,680 --> 04:04:01,680
alright, are we ready to break in

4101
04:04:03,920 --> 04:04:11,409
I got a lot of troops here

4102
04:04:11,409 --> 04:04:13,409
alright, what do you got, you got food

4103
04:04:13,409 --> 04:04:15,409
you got food, you got people, we got

4104
04:04:15,409 --> 04:04:17,409
let's get some

4105
04:04:17,409 --> 04:04:19,649
what do I think of, what do I want here

4106
04:04:21,649 --> 04:04:25,950
there's an army, oh there's an army outside the town, right

4107
04:04:25,950 --> 04:04:27,950
alright, let Murius take a little bit of a rest

4108
04:04:27,950 --> 04:04:29,950
free will

4109
04:04:29,950 --> 04:04:33,090
oh fuck

4110
04:04:33,090 --> 04:04:37,440
Murius, time to get up

4111
04:04:39,440 --> 04:04:43,870
why are you going to come at this

4112
04:04:43,870 --> 04:04:45,870
what a mistake that was, that was an instant kill

4113
04:04:45,870 --> 04:04:47,870
the entire troop, every single person

4114
04:04:47,870 --> 04:04:49,870
instead, I instantly killed every single one

4115
04:04:49,870 --> 04:04:53,069
alright, counter attack time

4116
04:04:53,069 --> 04:04:58,319
let's go

4117
04:04:58,319 --> 04:05:00,319
let's get this fucking door open

4118
04:05:00,319 --> 04:05:07,729
get this wall down

4119
04:05:07,729 --> 04:05:14,770
save the game

4120
04:05:21,819 --> 04:05:27,780
how do I get in

4121
04:05:27,780 --> 04:05:31,170
people are getting shot with arrows

4122
04:05:34,370 --> 04:05:41,139
I can't attack the door

4123
04:05:41,139 --> 04:05:43,500
there's no attack door

4124
04:05:43,500 --> 04:05:45,500
I can't do it

4125
04:05:45,500 --> 04:05:48,829
I think only he can

4126
04:05:48,829 --> 04:05:52,860
into the door

4127
04:05:52,860 --> 04:05:54,860
oh my god

4128
04:05:54,860 --> 04:05:57,040
I didn't, I thought they could attack the fucking door

4129
04:05:57,040 --> 04:05:59,040
I didn't think only he could

4130
04:05:59,040 --> 04:06:01,040
everyone's dead

4131
04:06:03,040 --> 04:06:05,040
load the game, load the game

4132
04:06:05,040 --> 04:06:07,340
I thought that they could attack the door, they can't

4133
04:06:07,340 --> 04:06:28,780
load game, okay, Murius come here

4134
04:06:28,780 --> 04:06:32,290
get that door open

4135
04:06:32,290 --> 04:06:34,290
what the fuck is this range, oh my god

4136
04:06:34,290 --> 04:06:36,290
you can shoot across the whole game

4137
04:06:36,290 --> 04:06:50,610
open this door

4138
04:06:50,610 --> 04:06:54,450
how much health does a door have

4139
04:06:54,450 --> 04:06:59,120
Murius is going to die

4140
04:06:59,120 --> 04:07:01,120
he's fatter than ever

4141
04:07:01,120 --> 04:07:03,360
alright, alright

4142
04:07:03,360 --> 04:07:05,360
oh good, punch

4143
04:07:05,360 --> 04:07:07,360
alright, everybody in

4144
04:07:07,360 --> 04:07:09,540
there's a fight already going on

4145
04:07:12,739 --> 04:07:18,620
alright, retreat, retreat, retreat

4146
04:07:18,620 --> 04:07:20,620
no, no, retreat, retreat

4147
04:07:20,620 --> 04:07:22,620
don't rip the walls down, Murius

4148
04:07:22,620 --> 04:07:24,620
alright, you're free, turn the free will off

4149
04:07:24,620 --> 04:07:30,829
it's too dangerous, I need more

4150
04:07:30,829 --> 04:07:32,829
I need more men, oh god

4151
04:07:32,829 --> 04:07:35,649
now's not the time to laugh

4152
04:07:41,219 --> 04:07:43,219
wait, where the fuck are these going

4153
04:07:43,219 --> 04:07:45,219
where the fuck are they, there's too many

4154
04:07:45,219 --> 04:07:47,219
okay, this is a shitload of people

4155
04:07:47,219 --> 04:07:49,219
it's time to run, Murius, out

4156
04:07:49,219 --> 04:07:51,219
get out, out, out, out, out, this is a lost cause

4157
04:07:51,219 --> 04:07:53,219
lost cause, lost cause, they're recapturing

4158
04:07:53,219 --> 04:07:55,219
whatever, just go back, back, back, back

4159
04:07:55,219 --> 04:07:57,219
we gotta make up, we gotta make up army three

4160
04:07:57,219 --> 04:07:59,520
times this big, we got the door down

4161
04:07:59,520 --> 04:08:01,520
that's all that matters

4162
04:08:01,520 --> 04:08:03,520
no, no, don't stomp the platoon, just get out

4163
04:08:03,520 --> 04:08:05,520
get out, get out, get out, get out, in fact, you know what

4164
04:08:05,520 --> 04:08:07,520
we're gonna save scum, just a little bit here

04:08:07,520 --> 04:08:09,520
we're just gonna save scum the game

4166
04:08:09,520 --> 04:08:19,889
we're just gonna be scumbags

4167
04:08:19,889 --> 04:08:21,889
everybody out, out, out, out, everybody go

4168
04:08:21,889 --> 04:08:23,889

4175
04:08:39,059 --> 04:08:41,059
Murius

4176
04:08:41,059 --> 04:08:43,059
now we're gonna build up the town here

4177
04:08:43,059 --> 04:08:47,020
we're getting

4178
04:08:47,020 --> 04:08:49,020
trashed

4179
04:08:49,020 --> 04:08:51,020
you know what to do

4180
04:08:51,020 --> 04:08:56,659
free will

4181
04:08:56,659 --> 04:08:58,659
go ahead and do whatever you want

4182
04:08:58,659 --> 04:09:00,659
for the time being, while I decide what

4183
04:09:00,659 --> 04:09:02,659
I'm gonna do here

4184
04:09:02,659 --> 04:09:04,659
there needs to be

4185
04:09:04,659 --> 04:09:06,659
prepare a force to destroy these

4186
04:09:06,659 --> 04:09:08,659
okay, I need a, we need

4187
04:09:08,659 --> 04:09:10,659
we need

4188
04:09:10,659 --> 04:09:12,659
war

4189
04:09:12,659 --> 04:09:14,659
no, don't attack the building

4190
04:09:14,659 --> 04:09:16,659
it's not gonna end

4191
04:09:16,659 --> 04:09:18,659
it's not gonna end

4192
04:09:18,659 --> 04:09:20,659
he's just, he's out for blood and I can't stop him

4193
04:09:20,659 --> 04:09:26,610
I may have come up

4194
04:09:26,610 --> 04:09:28,610

4195
04:09:28,610 --> 04:09:30,909

4196
04:09:30,909 --> 04:09:33,469
we need, how much do I have

4197
04:09:33,469 --> 04:09:36,030
I need another armor

4198
04:09:36,030 --> 04:09:41,020

4199
04:09:41,020 --> 04:09:43,520
what's he doing

4200
04:09:43,520 --> 04:09:45,520
Murius, do something, do anything

4201
04:09:45,520 --> 04:09:51,459
what the fuck is going on

4202
04:09:51,459 --> 04:09:53,459
what?

4203
04:09:53,459 --> 04:09:55,459
where are you going, stop

4204
04:09:55,459 --> 04:09:59,299
sell, sell, sell

4205
04:09:59,299 --> 04:10:01,920
everything

4206
04:10:01,920 --> 04:10:08,129
I have no idea what he's doing

4207
04:10:08,129 --> 04:10:10,430
but it's, I came up here way too

4208
04:10:10,430 --> 04:10:12,430
I need to have like a hundred troops

4209
04:10:12,430 --> 04:10:15,250
what do they got in the store room

4210
04:10:15,250 --> 04:10:44,479
okay, who's available

4211
04:10:44,479 --> 04:10:48,379
five people

4212
04:10:48,379 --> 04:10:50,379
good enough

4213
04:10:54,379 --> 04:10:56,379
wait, don't take all the men

4214
04:10:56,379 --> 04:10:58,379
don't take all the men

4215
04:11:13,420 --> 04:11:15,420
Murius and earn my reward

4216
04:11:15,420 --> 04:11:17,420
from the Aztecs

4217
04:11:17,420 --> 04:11:19,420
throwing their soldiers

4218
04:11:19,420 --> 04:11:21,420
back over their walls

4219
04:11:21,420 --> 04:11:26,930
Murius is dead

4220
04:11:26,930 --> 04:11:29,299
Murius went too hard

4221
04:11:29,299 --> 04:11:31,299
I shall put these intruders

4222
04:11:31,299 --> 04:11:33,790
come on, get them over the gate

4223
04:11:33,790 --> 04:11:37,500
get them over the gate

4224
04:11:37,500 --> 04:11:39,500
the Greek warriors have

4225
04:11:39,500 --> 04:11:41,500
spirits

4226
04:11:41,500 --> 04:11:44,700
shit

4227
04:11:44,700 --> 04:12:00,559
the Greek town

4228
04:12:00,559 --> 04:12:02,559
cannot be allowed to grow

4229
04:12:02,559 --> 04:12:04,559
ranged armory

4230
04:12:04,559 --> 04:12:06,559
I need houses and shit

4231
04:12:06,559 --> 04:12:08,559
he's gonna come back angrier

4232
04:12:08,559 --> 04:12:12,399
and fatter

4233
04:12:12,399 --> 04:12:16,239
probably, but I need

4234
04:12:16,239 --> 04:12:18,239
I need more houses

4235
04:12:18,239 --> 04:12:21,819
what do I have for roads here, okay

4236
04:12:21,819 --> 04:12:24,510
I need a ton more

4237
04:12:24,510 --> 04:12:27,579
men

4238
04:12:27,579 --> 04:12:29,579
it's gonna be sloppy but I don't care, it just needs to work

4239
04:12:29,579 --> 04:12:34,579
everybody breed

4240
04:12:34,579 --> 04:12:38,590
my other towns are fine

4241
04:12:38,590 --> 04:12:40,590
I know it's ugly as hell

4242
04:12:40,590 --> 04:12:55,569
we need a lot of soldiers

4243
04:12:55,569 --> 04:12:59,729
even back here

4244
04:12:59,729 --> 04:13:01,729
it doesn't matter if it's ugly

4245
04:13:01,729 --> 04:13:05,819
it just has to work, this has to exist

4246
04:13:05,819 --> 04:13:07,819
I'll get a road back here eventually

4247
04:13:07,819 --> 04:13:21,899
I need a bigger army

4248
04:13:21,899 --> 04:13:36,670
I need range too

4249
04:13:36,670 --> 04:13:40,899
breeders

4250
04:13:40,899 --> 04:13:42,899
who old to be a disciple?

4251
04:13:42,899 --> 04:13:46,670

4252
04:13:46,670 --> 04:13:50,129
breed, breed, breed, we need more breeding

4253
04:13:50,129 --> 04:13:54,930
more breeding

4254
04:13:54,930 --> 04:13:56,930
no wood, breed

4255
04:13:56,930 --> 04:13:58,930
are they gonna be kids?

4256
04:13:58,930 --> 04:14:01,170
wait, this is not gonna work

4257
04:14:01,170 --> 04:14:04,299
I'll let this play out for a little bit

4258
04:14:04,299 --> 04:14:10,700
I just tried to breed this guy with a pig

4259
04:14:10,700 --> 04:14:12,700
okay, that's not gonna work

4260
04:14:12,700 --> 04:14:26,530
okay, good

4261
04:14:26,530 --> 04:14:29,540
let's make some kids

4262
04:14:29,540 --> 04:14:37,969
Murius?

4263
04:14:37,969 --> 04:14:43,729
actually fatter

4264
04:14:43,729 --> 04:14:54,479
that's not even a joke, actually fatter

4265
04:14:54,479 --> 04:14:59,600
I need you up here

4266
04:14:59,600 --> 04:15:01,600
actually, go rest up in here

4267
04:15:01,600 --> 04:15:06,719
for a little bit

4268
04:15:06,719 --> 04:15:08,719
do I have any more military capabilities

4269
04:15:08,719 --> 04:15:10,719
I know that there's like a million people

4270
04:15:10,719 --> 04:15:12,719
down here

4271
04:15:12,719 --> 04:15:14,719
what about over here? how many men can I make here?

4272
04:15:14,719 --> 04:15:18,819

4273
04:15:18,819 --> 04:15:20,819

4274
04:15:22,819 --> 04:15:24,819

4275
04:15:24,819 --> 04:15:27,180

4276
04:15:27,180 --> 04:15:30,190
oh, yeah, I'll take 60 people

4277
04:15:30,190 --> 04:15:42,219

4278
04:15:42,219 --> 04:15:45,170

4279
04:16:01,579 --> 04:16:04,909

4280
04:16:04,909 --> 04:16:09,309

4281
04:16:09,309 --> 04:16:11,309

4282
04:16:11,309 --> 04:16:15,790

4283
04:16:15,790 --> 04:16:17,790

4289
04:16:57,940 --> 04:16:59,940

4290
04:16:59,940 --> 04:17:02,879

prepare a force to destroy these Greek troops

4304
04:17:50,059 --> 04:17:52,059

granary

4361
04:21:40,670 --> 04:21:42,670

advanced soldier

4368
04:21:56,799 --> 04:22:00,260
the next level of warrior skills for the creature

4369
04:22:00,260 --> 04:22:02,260
will be more effective and dangerous in combat

4370
04:22:02,260 --> 04:22:04,260
it'll be harder to hurt

4371
04:22:04,260 --> 04:22:08,739
fire miracle

4372
04:22:08,739 --> 04:22:11,680

4378
04:22:36,659 --> 04:22:38,659
let's get everybody up here

4379
04:22:38,659 --> 04:22:41,659
it's time to move in and fight

4380
04:22:41,659 --> 04:22:53,629
let's get you guys

4381
04:22:53,629 --> 04:23:01,809
alright, come with me

4382
04:23:01,809 --> 04:23:03,809
I want you all up in the general area

4383
04:23:03,809 --> 04:23:15,840
once they're all up in this general area

4384
04:23:15,840 --> 04:23:17,840
I'll open the front door

4385
04:23:17,840 --> 04:23:19,840
this door is open

4386
04:23:19,840 --> 04:23:22,530
this fucking door is open

4387
04:23:22,530 --> 04:23:24,530
let's go in the front door

4388
04:23:24,530 --> 04:23:26,530
why are we going in the door that's closed?

4389
04:23:26,530 --> 04:23:32,290
going in the door that's open

4390
04:23:32,290 --> 04:23:47,059
we're going in the door that's open

4391
04:23:47,059 --> 04:23:49,059
okay, there's tons of people up here now

4392
04:23:49,059 --> 04:23:53,020
let me make a torture pit

4393
04:23:53,020 --> 04:23:55,020
so we can literally just

4394
04:23:55,020 --> 04:23:57,020
when they come in, just pick them up and put them in here

4395
04:23:57,020 --> 04:24:00,209
and just torture them

4396
04:24:00,209 --> 04:24:15,059
I don't even need that much

4397
04:24:15,059 --> 04:24:17,059
I need ore

4398
04:24:17,059 --> 04:24:20,000
alright, so this is done

4399
04:24:20,000 --> 04:24:22,930
how does this work?

4400
04:24:22,930 --> 04:24:28,690
just pick somebody and put them in

4401
04:24:28,690 --> 04:24:30,860
so do I have to train this

4402
04:24:30,860 --> 04:24:32,860
or is Murius already leveled up

4403
04:24:32,860 --> 04:24:34,860
like the advanced soldier, or do I have to do something about that

4404
04:24:34,860 --> 04:24:41,709
do I have to put it somewhere

4405
04:24:41,709 --> 04:24:43,709
already upgraded, nice, okay, good

4406
04:24:43,709 --> 04:24:45,709
no, no, no, no, no

4407
04:24:45,709 --> 04:24:47,709
you can snack on the grain

4408
04:24:47,709 --> 04:24:49,709
snack on the grain, but don't run in

4409
04:24:49,709 --> 04:24:51,709
this door is open, we're going to go in the open door

4410
04:24:51,709 --> 04:24:55,809
army is here

4411
04:24:55,809 --> 04:24:58,620
now, do I

4412
04:24:58,620 --> 04:25:00,620
don't tear down those walls

4413
04:25:00,620 --> 04:25:05,809
stay here, let's get some archers

4414
04:25:05,809 --> 04:25:18,100
don't eat a villager

4415
04:25:18,100 --> 04:25:20,100
don't eat a villager

4416
04:25:20,100 --> 04:25:22,100
are they hitting them?

4417
04:25:22,100 --> 04:25:28,610
are they hitting them?

4418
04:25:28,610 --> 04:25:30,610
alright, do not eat a villager

4419
04:25:30,610 --> 04:25:32,850
here, eat this instead

4420
04:25:32,850 --> 04:25:36,370
eat that

4421
04:25:36,370 --> 04:25:40,450
yum

4422
04:25:40,450 --> 04:25:42,879
yummy

4423
04:25:42,879 --> 04:25:44,879
eat

4424
04:25:55,969 --> 04:25:57,969
what's going on, what are you guys doing

4425
04:25:57,969 --> 04:26:00,979
what the hell are you guys doing

4426
04:26:13,409 --> 04:26:17,680
alright, sick

4427
04:26:17,680 --> 04:26:23,809
cool

4428
04:26:23,809 --> 04:26:32,829
this sucks

4429
04:26:32,829 --> 04:26:34,829
I have so many people being bred

4430
04:26:34,829 --> 04:26:39,180
alright, I need, I need wood

4431
04:26:39,180 --> 04:26:41,180
we gotta get going, I need archers

4432
04:26:41,180 --> 04:26:47,200
once that's done, I'm just going

4433
04:26:47,200 --> 04:26:55,780
in the fucking back door

4434
04:26:59,090 --> 04:27:04,270
what, I just throw that

4435
04:27:06,270 --> 04:27:08,270
is that going to be seen as an attack, because I was not ready to attack

4436
04:27:08,270 --> 04:27:11,090
is that an attack

4437
04:27:11,090 --> 04:27:16,270
we share the hatred

4438
04:27:16,270 --> 04:27:18,270
for the Greeks that our Aztec

4439
04:27:18,270 --> 04:27:21,860
masters have

4440
04:27:21,860 --> 04:27:23,860
what in the name of fucking god are you guys

4441
04:27:23,860 --> 04:27:26,350
doing in this chat

4442
04:27:26,350 --> 04:27:32,819
what the hell are you doing

4443
04:27:32,819 --> 04:27:34,819
this is like, this is just

4444
04:27:34,819 --> 04:27:36,819
nonsense

4445
04:27:36,819 --> 04:27:38,819
it's just absolute fucking nonsense

4446
04:27:38,819 --> 04:27:42,209
the town is getting

4447
04:27:42,209 --> 04:27:57,819
mashed up

4448
04:27:57,819 --> 04:28:06,020
you guys lost your damn minds

4449
04:28:06,020 --> 04:28:08,020
wait, wait, wait

4450
04:28:08,020 --> 04:28:11,920

4451
04:28:11,920 --> 04:28:13,920
stopping, what are you stopping, stop, stop, what are you doing

4452
04:28:13,920 --> 04:28:19,229

4453
04:28:19,229 --> 04:28:22,879

4454
04:28:22,879 --> 04:28:27,040
alright, well fucking settle down

4455
04:28:27,040 --> 04:28:29,340
you guys are making me anxious

4456
04:28:29,340 --> 04:28:33,120
what the hell is going on over here

4457
04:28:33,120 --> 04:28:35,120
this is not even like typical crack chat night

4458
04:28:35,120 --> 04:28:37,120
this is just like, writing random

4459
04:28:37,120 --> 04:28:40,379
words

4460
04:28:40,379 --> 04:28:42,379
what the fuck are you doing

4461
04:28:42,379 --> 04:28:55,250
alright, I need

4462
04:28:55,250 --> 04:28:57,250
I can't pick up the archer flag, why not

4463
04:28:57,250 --> 04:29:00,000
is that not enough men

4464
04:29:00,000 --> 04:29:02,000
not enough ore, what the fuck are you talking about

4465
04:29:02,000 --> 04:29:13,180
how do I not have ore for this

4466
04:29:13,180 --> 04:29:15,180
something is currently being taken

4467
04:29:15,180 --> 04:29:18,579
okay

4468
04:29:18,579 --> 04:29:44,690
what are you guys doing

4469
04:29:44,690 --> 04:29:50,559
alright, quell it

4470
04:29:50,559 --> 04:29:53,059
quell it, slow mode

4471
04:29:53,059 --> 04:29:57,149
two minute slow mode at least

4472
04:29:57,149 --> 04:29:59,149
quell it, quell it, quell it, quell it, quell it

4473
04:29:59,149 --> 04:30:09,389
two minute slow mode at least

4474
04:30:09,389 --> 04:30:14,959
and keep it on, and keep that shit on

4475
04:30:14,959 --> 04:30:21,870
see you in two minutes loser

4476
04:30:21,870 --> 04:30:23,870
good use of your two

4477
04:30:23,870 --> 04:30:28,159
minute sentence

4478
04:30:28,159 --> 04:30:30,159
slow mode doesn't work

4479
04:30:30,159 --> 04:30:33,739
what the fuck

4480
04:30:33,739 --> 04:30:35,739
you guys are fucking nuts

4481
04:30:35,739 --> 04:30:38,500
alright, I do a video game

4482
04:30:38,500 --> 04:30:40,500
to play

4483
04:30:40,500 --> 04:30:43,309
I don't have

4484
04:30:43,309 --> 04:30:45,309
any soldiers here

4485
04:30:45,309 --> 04:30:47,309
is it any soldiers at all

4486
04:30:47,309 --> 04:30:51,149
how far away is that from Urius

4487
04:30:51,149 --> 04:30:53,149
I don't care about that town anymore

4488
04:30:53,149 --> 04:30:57,440
I have fucking a thousand people, let's go

4489
04:30:57,440 --> 04:30:59,440
I need archers, but I don't know what I need

4490
04:30:59,440 --> 04:31:01,440
or a number of troops

4491
04:31:01,440 --> 04:31:03,440
you can create fourteen troops

4492
04:31:03,440 --> 04:31:05,440
okay, let's go, I can do fourteen

4493
04:31:05,440 --> 04:31:08,000
fourteen archers

4494
04:31:11,459 --> 04:31:13,459
I need, we need to go, we gotta go in the front door over here

4495
04:31:31,200 --> 04:31:33,200
we gotta go in and take the whole thing

4496
04:31:33,200 --> 04:31:36,260
save the game here

4497
04:31:42,190 --> 04:31:44,190
what about the archers on the walls

4498
04:31:44,190 --> 04:31:47,010
there's only like three right there

4499
04:31:47,010 --> 04:31:49,010
can I leash you to like a tree or something

4500
04:31:49,010 --> 04:31:51,629
alright, stay over here

4501
04:31:51,629 --> 04:31:53,940
I'm gonna leash you to a big rock

4502
04:31:53,940 --> 04:31:56,430
come over here, I have to walk the other direction

4503
04:31:56,430 --> 04:31:58,430
they're gonna take that town, but I can take

4504
04:31:58,430 --> 04:32:00,430
I can literally take over the whole capital

4505
04:32:00,430 --> 04:32:07,540
this is a long fucking walk

4506
04:32:07,540 --> 04:32:10,420
god damn it, that's a long walk

4507
04:32:12,420 --> 04:32:14,420
that's a long walk

4508
04:32:16,420 --> 04:32:18,420
this door's closed now, shit

4509
04:32:18,420 --> 04:32:20,780
reload the game

4510
04:32:20,780 --> 04:32:29,680
no, it's too late

4511
04:32:29,680 --> 04:32:31,680
we have to put it on five minutes slow-mo

4512
04:32:31,680 --> 04:32:34,239
we actually have to do this

4513
04:32:34,239 --> 04:32:38,239
recruit an army to send against their puny forces

4514
04:32:38,239 --> 04:32:41,180
break this down

4515
04:32:41,180 --> 04:32:43,180
someone's isolated tribe

4516
04:32:43,180 --> 04:32:48,750
break the door down, get everybody in

4517
04:32:48,750 --> 04:33:00,209
the door's gonna go down, I got fucking like a thousand people right now

4518
04:33:00,209 --> 04:33:07,250
break it down, get in there

4519
04:33:07,250 --> 04:33:11,020
shoot those guys up here

4520
04:33:11,020 --> 04:33:13,020
archers

4521
04:33:13,020 --> 04:33:22,740
get in the door

4522
04:33:22,740 --> 04:33:28,180
look at the range, they can't even shoot

4523
04:33:28,180 --> 04:33:30,180
alright, good, good, good, good

4524
04:33:30,180 --> 04:33:32,180

4525
04:33:32,180 --> 04:33:35,950
alright, alright, he's in, he's in

4528
04:33:41,979 --> 04:33:43,979
oh my god, why'd I have to pick up flags to have to go fight

4529
04:33:43,979 --> 04:33:48,209
what the hell

4530
04:33:48,209 --> 04:33:51,220
pick up flag, drop flag

4531
04:33:51,220 --> 04:33:53,220
oh fuck, come on

4532
04:33:53,220 --> 04:33:55,840
he's picking up a weapon

4533
04:33:55,840 --> 04:33:57,840
he's picking up a weapon

4534
04:33:57,840 --> 04:33:59,840
alright, the door is open, whatever, we're gonna win

4535
04:33:59,840 --> 04:34:05,090
actually, you stay away

4536
04:34:05,090 --> 04:34:09,810
get in

4537
04:34:09,810 --> 04:34:27,970

move, move, move, move, move, keep moving, new target

4539
04:34:29,970 --> 04:34:31,970
we have to capture, capture, capture

4540
04:34:31,970 --> 04:34:36,189
oh, here we go, this is it

4541
04:34:36,189 --> 04:34:42,770
fight him, fight him

4542
04:34:42,770 --> 04:34:49,299
Murius, get

4543
04:34:49,299 --> 04:34:51,540
Murius, get over there

4544
04:34:51,540 --> 04:34:53,540
throw it free

4545
04:34:53,540 --> 04:34:55,540
Kevin, he's killing everyone

4546
04:34:55,540 --> 04:34:58,159
everyone is dead

4547
04:34:58,159 --> 04:35:00,590
attack him

4548
04:35:00,590 --> 04:35:02,590
attack him, what are you doing

4549
04:35:02,590 --> 04:35:04,590
what are you doing

4550
04:35:04,590 --> 04:35:06,590
you're leashed

4551
04:35:06,590 --> 04:35:11,330
to him

4552
04:35:11,330 --> 04:35:13,330
oh, now you wanna fight

4553
04:35:13,330 --> 04:35:15,330
and now you decide it's time to attack

4554
04:35:15,330 --> 04:35:17,700
he's kicking

4555
04:35:17,700 --> 04:35:19,700

4556
04:35:19,700 --> 04:35:21,700
fight him

4557
04:35:21,700 --> 04:35:23,700
his archers shoot me in the back too

4558
04:35:23,700 --> 04:35:25,700
god damn it man

4559
04:35:25,700 --> 04:35:27,700
I'm not even hitting the right direction

4560
04:35:27,700 --> 04:35:29,700
what the fuck

4561
04:35:29,700 --> 04:35:31,700
get up

4562
04:35:31,700 --> 04:35:33,700
and fight

4563
04:35:33,700 --> 04:35:39,459
oh my god

4564
04:35:39,459 --> 04:35:42,529
it was a disaster

4565
04:35:42,529 --> 04:35:44,529
reload the game, reload the game

4566
04:35:44,529 --> 04:35:50,220
reload the game

4567
04:35:50,220 --> 04:35:53,549
okay, so I

4568
04:35:53,549 --> 04:35:55,729
walked in

4569
04:35:55,729 --> 04:35:57,900
and he killed everyone

4570
04:35:57,900 --> 04:36:07,919
so

4571
04:36:07,919 --> 04:36:09,919
we're gonna have to rethink this strategy

4572
04:36:09,919 --> 04:36:20,220
so let's go back to where we were

4573
04:36:20,220 --> 04:36:23,169
come back here

4574
04:36:23,169 --> 04:36:29,630
Murius, come back over here

4575
04:36:29,630 --> 04:36:31,630
so

4576
04:36:31,630 --> 04:36:33,630
I'm still being shot with arrows

4577
04:36:33,630 --> 04:36:39,169
oh my god

4578
04:36:39,169 --> 04:36:41,169
why is it so hard

4579
04:36:41,169 --> 04:36:43,409
okay, get over here

4580
04:36:43,409 --> 04:36:45,409
so, the plan here

4581
04:36:45,409 --> 04:36:47,409
the pitiful survivors of the Aztec

4582
04:36:47,409 --> 04:36:49,409
I need to

4583
04:36:49,409 --> 04:36:51,409
stop whippin' fireballs and shit

4584
04:36:51,409 --> 04:36:53,779
we need spells

4585
04:36:53,779 --> 04:36:55,779
so

4586
04:36:55,779 --> 04:36:57,779
I need to build a

4587
04:36:57,779 --> 04:36:59,779
first of all, first of all, first of all, Murius, come with me

4588
04:36:59,779 --> 04:37:01,779
there's currently

4589
04:37:01,779 --> 04:37:03,779
they're taking over a city

4590
04:37:03,779 --> 04:37:06,080
we need you to go over here

4591
04:37:06,080 --> 04:37:08,080
on your soldier

4592
04:37:10,080 --> 04:37:12,080
come over here

4593
04:37:12,080 --> 04:37:14,080
and come

4594
04:37:14,080 --> 04:37:16,080
it's, it's, it's

4595
04:37:16,080 --> 04:37:18,080
one person, I'm kidding

4596
04:37:18,080 --> 04:37:20,080
is it actually just one god damn person

4597
04:37:20,080 --> 04:37:30,900
I don't even know

4598
04:37:30,900 --> 04:37:45,040
where are they

4599
04:37:45,040 --> 04:37:47,040
are they still, who is taking it

4600
04:37:47,040 --> 04:37:49,040
okay, good, okay, very good

4601
04:37:49,040 --> 04:37:52,619
let's go ahead and do that again on the other one

4602
04:37:52,619 --> 04:37:54,619
wherever, okay, good, right

4603
04:37:54,619 --> 04:38:05,810
um

4604
04:38:05,810 --> 04:38:12,529
okay, you know where this got all

4605
04:38:12,529 --> 04:38:14,529
fucked up is where I didn't realize that I had to buy

4606
04:38:14,529 --> 04:38:16,529
the new stuff with tribute

4607
04:38:16,529 --> 04:38:18,529
and it's been like, I did it the whole

4608
04:38:18,529 --> 04:38:21,220
game

4609
04:38:21,220 --> 04:38:25,250
game

4610
04:38:25,250 --> 04:38:27,250
why is chat so slow? uh, because they were

4611
04:38:27,250 --> 04:38:29,250
unruly

4612
04:38:29,250 --> 04:38:31,250
and they had to be quelled

4613
04:38:31,250 --> 04:38:33,250
they had to be stopped

4614
04:38:33,250 --> 04:38:36,380
alright, so

4615
04:38:36,380 --> 04:38:40,669
uh

4616
04:38:40,669 --> 04:38:42,909
what do I wanna do?

4617
04:38:42,909 --> 04:38:44,909
how do I wanna do this? I'm gonna have to

4618
04:38:44,909 --> 04:38:46,909
I pulled all the troops up here, fuck

4619
04:38:46,909 --> 04:38:51,650
alright, I want to

4620
04:38:51,650 --> 04:38:58,990
what are they doing?

4621
04:38:58,990 --> 04:39:00,990
oh, they're putting the fires out

4622
04:39:00,990 --> 04:39:02,990
these people still, you know what?

4623
04:39:02,990 --> 04:39:04,990
I have to, oh, yeah, yeah, I should have made like

4624
04:39:04,990 --> 04:39:09,470
three or four saves

4625
04:39:09,470 --> 04:39:11,470
I'm so far done at this point, like I'm

4626
04:39:11,470 --> 04:39:13,470
fucked

4627
04:39:13,470 --> 04:39:15,470
I need to have rewound like an hour and a half

4628
04:39:15,470 --> 04:39:18,740
and like build other buildings

4629
04:39:18,740 --> 04:39:20,740
I have to just hurt myself, I have to

4630
04:39:20,740 --> 04:39:23,169
and then just go back from

4631
04:39:23,169 --> 04:39:25,169
scratch and build buildings

4632
04:39:25,169 --> 04:39:27,169
I gotta take out a whole city, we gotta torch the city

4633
04:39:27,169 --> 04:39:32,419
it's gotta be done

4634
04:39:32,419 --> 04:39:48,419
alright, we're through from scratch

4635
04:39:48,419 --> 04:39:54,110
are we still getting attacked somewhere?

4636
04:39:54,110 --> 04:39:56,349
that top city is gonna be under attack

4637
04:39:56,349 --> 04:39:58,349
is he alive?

4638
04:39:58,349 --> 04:40:01,099
alright

4639
04:40:03,099 --> 04:40:05,099
so this is how to do fire

4640
04:40:05,099 --> 04:40:07,099
heal

4641
04:40:07,099 --> 04:40:09,099
and now can I just do them in the air like this?

4642
04:40:09,099 --> 04:40:11,099
do I have to press a certain button?

4643
04:40:11,099 --> 04:40:15,970
is there like an activation

4644
04:40:15,970 --> 04:40:29,729
thing that I need to do?

4645
04:40:29,729 --> 04:40:31,729
I was gonna say, can we get rid of the guy that just did all caps

4646
04:40:31,729 --> 04:40:33,729

4647
04:40:33,729 --> 04:40:35,729

I gotta kill this guy, I gotta take this guy out

4650
04:40:48,659 --> 04:40:51,979
there has to be like an activation right?

4651
04:40:51,979 --> 04:40:53,979
69

4652
04:40:53,979 --> 04:40:57,889
as long as I keep those people up there

4653
04:40:57,889 --> 04:40:59,889
I'm going to

4654
04:40:59,889 --> 04:41:03,919
let's get some archers

4655
04:41:03,919 --> 04:41:06,099
but first let me build

4656
04:41:06,099 --> 04:41:08,099
I took all the able bodied men from

4657
04:41:08,099 --> 04:41:10,099
every community

4658
04:41:10,099 --> 04:41:12,459

let's start some breeding

4661
04:41:23,470 --> 04:41:37,540
this game is a bit hard?

4662
04:41:37,540 --> 04:41:40,610
I mean from it's very nature

4663
04:41:40,610 --> 04:41:42,610
I think it probably is

4664
04:41:42,610 --> 04:41:44,610
what's going on in there?

4665
04:41:44,610 --> 04:41:46,849
can we pull all these people out?

4666
04:41:46,849 --> 04:41:48,849
there's a shit little people in there

4667
04:41:48,849 --> 04:41:51,599

I fucked up the whole earth's population

4676
04:42:12,450 --> 04:42:14,450
I sent every man to war

4677
04:42:20,340 --> 04:42:25,009
there's no men

4678
04:42:25,009 --> 04:42:29,040
I fucked up all of earth

4679
04:42:29,040 --> 04:42:31,220

is chat really this bored?

4687
04:43:20,509 --> 04:43:22,509
I have no idea apparently

4688
04:43:22,509 --> 04:43:25,330
apparently

4689
04:43:25,330 --> 04:43:37,419
but whatever

4690
04:43:37,419 --> 04:43:39,979
that's just the way it is apparently

4691
04:43:41,979 --> 04:43:46,979
chat loves

4692
04:43:46,979 --> 04:43:48,979
slow mo they like to talk about how much

4693
04:43:48,979 --> 04:43:53,520
is their favorite thing

4694
04:43:53,520 --> 04:43:55,520
Dermot please turn up and ban that person

4695
04:43:55,520 --> 04:44:00,189
I'm not even kidding for like at least 10 minutes

4696
04:44:00,189 --> 04:44:02,880
where are they all going?

4697
04:44:13,900 --> 04:44:17,619
oh

4698
04:44:17,619 --> 04:44:19,790
I put all my eggs

4699
04:44:19,790 --> 04:44:21,790
in one basket and that basket was

4700
04:44:21,790 --> 04:44:23,790
wrong

4701
04:44:23,790 --> 04:44:25,790
and he's so much stronger

4702
04:44:25,790 --> 04:44:28,669
than me

4703
04:44:28,669 --> 04:44:35,580

4705
04:44:37,889 --> 04:44:53,819
give me like two

4706
04:44:53,819 --> 04:45:07,840
chat is very problematic

4707
04:45:07,840 --> 04:45:12,430
yeah what's going on today?

4708
04:45:12,430 --> 04:45:14,430
what is going on today?

4709
04:45:20,430 --> 04:45:22,430
are you guys all collectively like

4710
04:45:22,430 --> 04:45:25,439
huffing fucking glue?

4711
04:45:25,439 --> 04:45:38,619
like what are you guys doing?

4712
04:45:38,619 --> 04:45:42,139
you wouldn't understand

4713
04:45:42,139 --> 04:45:47,139
oh my god

4714
04:45:47,139 --> 04:45:49,139
what the fuck

4715
04:45:49,139 --> 04:45:59,180
anyways

4716
04:45:59,180 --> 04:46:01,180
I'm going to continue to pay attention to the video game

4717
04:46:01,180 --> 04:46:03,180
because that's what I'm doing

4718
04:46:03,180 --> 04:46:05,490
throwing rocks

4719
04:46:05,490 --> 04:46:09,259
did it work? alright we're gonna start throwing fireballs

4720
04:46:09,259 --> 04:46:11,259
that's the plan

4721
04:46:11,259 --> 04:46:16,770
Murius get up here

4722
04:46:16,770 --> 04:46:18,770
I need to build a

4723
04:46:18,770 --> 04:46:20,770
we're gonna close this out here

4724
04:46:20,770 --> 04:46:22,770
we're gonna close this one out good

4725
04:46:22,770 --> 04:46:25,009
I need a one of these things

4726
04:46:25,009 --> 04:46:29,619
an altar up here

4727
04:46:29,619 --> 04:46:31,619
with an altar I can just I'm gonna just whip bombs

4728
04:46:31,619 --> 04:46:44,740
across the gate and then we're going in

4729
04:46:44,740 --> 04:46:47,229
make it emote only

4730
04:46:47,229 --> 04:46:49,229
actually you know what

4731
04:46:49,229 --> 04:46:51,229
actually no don't do that

4732
04:46:51,229 --> 04:46:53,229
that's just when they come out of it

4733
04:46:53,229 --> 04:46:55,229
they're gonna be even worse

4734
04:46:55,229 --> 04:46:57,659
you know how that works?

4735
04:46:57,659 --> 04:46:59,659
it's like you're putting like a muzzle on somebody

4736
04:46:59,659 --> 04:47:01,659
and then they just go

4737
04:47:01,659 --> 04:47:03,659
I scream for when this muzzle comes up

4738
04:47:03,659 --> 04:47:06,099
and then the muzzle

4739
04:47:06,099 --> 04:47:14,159
yeah it's just not gonna work

4740
04:47:14,159 --> 04:47:16,159
just never take it off

4741
04:47:16,159 --> 04:47:18,849
that's so bad

4742
04:47:18,849 --> 04:47:22,500
we went better than this

4743
04:47:22,500 --> 04:47:24,500
we shouldn't have to do that

4744
04:47:24,500 --> 04:47:26,500
we shouldn't have to do that we're better than this

4745
04:47:26,500 --> 04:47:28,500
oh man

4746
04:47:28,500 --> 04:47:30,860
aw

4747
04:47:30,860 --> 04:47:35,279
no no no no

4748
04:47:35,279 --> 04:47:37,279
don't go in

4749
04:47:37,279 --> 04:47:39,520
recruit an army to send

4750
04:47:39,520 --> 04:47:41,520
against their puny forces

4751
04:47:41,520 --> 04:47:44,400
stay right here

4752
04:47:44,400 --> 04:47:46,400
stop stop stop stop

4753
04:47:46,400 --> 04:47:48,639
you're gonna get shot with arrows

4754
04:47:48,639 --> 04:47:53,740
first things first

4755
04:47:53,740 --> 04:47:56,049
get everyone ready

4756
04:47:56,049 --> 04:47:58,049
let's torch their whole city

4757
04:47:58,049 --> 04:48:03,020
I know you're angry

4758
04:48:03,020 --> 04:48:05,389
hungry? go eat something first

4759
04:48:05,389 --> 04:48:12,750
let's burn it down

4760
04:48:12,750 --> 04:48:19,340
burn their city to the ground

4761
04:48:19,340 --> 04:48:23,060
torch

4762
04:48:23,060 --> 04:48:27,279
destroy it

4763
04:48:27,279 --> 04:48:29,279
fire into the

4764
04:48:29,279 --> 04:48:31,279
watch this one

4765
04:48:31,279 --> 04:48:33,279
I'm just gonna drop this fireball right on the door

4766
04:48:33,279 --> 04:48:35,279
right here, boom

4767
04:48:35,279 --> 04:48:37,279
killed everybody

4768
04:48:39,279 --> 04:48:43,500
slow mode on twitch has an upper limit

4769
04:48:43,500 --> 04:48:45,500
I think it's like 30 minutes, I really think it is

4770
04:48:45,500 --> 04:48:50,880
shit, why hit the wall

4771
04:48:50,880 --> 04:48:52,880
alright, is it time to go in?

4772
04:48:52,880 --> 04:48:55,380
they don't have any fighters

4773
04:48:58,060 --> 04:49:00,060
um

4774
04:49:00,060 --> 04:49:02,060
Murius what the fuck are you doing?

4775
04:49:02,060 --> 04:49:04,060
Murius what are you doing?

4776
04:49:04,060 --> 04:49:06,060
no stop stop why are you fucking fighting

4777
04:49:06,060 --> 04:49:08,060
yourself?

4778
04:49:08,060 --> 04:49:10,880
is it the leash?

4779
04:49:10,880 --> 04:49:12,880
he's just so angry

4780
04:49:12,880 --> 04:49:14,880
stay stay stay stop stop what are you thinking?

4781
04:49:20,340 --> 04:49:22,340
alright he's just going in

4782
04:49:22,340 --> 04:49:24,340
I can't stop him

4783
04:49:24,340 --> 04:49:37,779
the embodiment of chat right now he's just going in

4784
04:49:37,779 --> 04:49:39,779
can I break the door down with this?

4785
04:49:39,779 --> 04:49:52,319
I wonder

4786
04:49:52,319 --> 04:50:09,090
it might be time to go in

4787
04:50:09,090 --> 04:50:13,060
it's an allegory for your power in black and white

4788
04:50:13,060 --> 04:50:15,549
what happened to all my friends?

4789
04:50:15,549 --> 04:50:20,349
perfect shot

4790
04:50:20,349 --> 04:50:23,680
nope

4791
04:50:23,680 --> 04:50:25,680
alright let's drop a bomb right here and let's try to get in the front door

4792
04:50:25,680 --> 04:50:30,610
I'm going in with

4793
04:50:30,610 --> 04:50:34,130
let's see if I can hit it come on

4794
04:50:34,130 --> 04:50:36,500
alright time to go in

4795
04:50:36,500 --> 04:50:38,990
this is the opportunity

4796
04:50:38,990 --> 04:50:40,990
Murius I need you

4797
04:50:40,990 --> 04:50:42,990
to be on soldier mode

4798
04:50:42,990 --> 04:50:45,419
they don't have any more archers so that's good

4799
04:50:45,419 --> 04:50:49,520
break the fucking door down let's go

4800
04:50:49,520 --> 04:50:51,520
you're supposed to bring balance to the force

4801
04:50:51,520 --> 04:50:57,220
not destroy it

4802
04:50:57,220 --> 04:51:01,310
don't care lester

4803
04:51:01,310 --> 04:51:03,619
where do I land these guys?

4804
04:51:03,619 --> 04:51:05,979
where do I capture?

4805
04:51:05,979 --> 04:51:09,439
where's the thing to capture?

4806
04:51:09,439 --> 04:51:12,509
attack? where is it?

4807
04:51:12,509 --> 04:51:20,060
right there

4808
04:51:20,060 --> 04:51:25,740
Murius why have you stopped hitting the door?

4809
04:51:25,740 --> 04:51:27,740
Murius

4810
04:51:27,740 --> 04:51:30,750
Murius the door

4811
04:51:30,750 --> 04:51:32,750

4812
04:51:32,750 --> 04:51:34,750
Murius the door

04:51:34,750 --> 04:51:38,779
Murius the door

4814
04:51:38,779 --> 04:51:43,139
Murius the door

4815
04:51:43,139 --> 04:51:46,849
Murius the door

4816
04:51:46,849 --> 04:51:52,029
Murius

4817
04:51:52,029 --> 04:51:54,029
the door

4818
04:52:01,340 --> 04:52:03,340
excellent work

4819
04:52:03,340 --> 04:52:05,340
My son

4820
04:52:07,340 --> 04:52:19,099
Torch it

4821
04:52:19,099 --> 04:52:21,099

4822
04:52:21,099 --> 04:52:26,540
god you can do it you're supposed to be

4823
04:52:26,540 --> 04:52:28,540
super strong

4824
04:52:28,540 --> 04:52:31,299
alright alright

4825
04:52:31,299 --> 04:52:33,299

4826
04:52:33,299 --> 04:52:35,299

4828
04:52:37,299 --> 04:52:43,279
In. In. Capture. Get it?

4829
04:52:43,279 --> 04:53:02,060
What? This is how he's destroying him.

4830
04:53:07,229 --> 04:53:08,669
Holy shit.

4831
04:53:12,479 --> 04:53:17,040
Take the town over. That was pure fucking rage.

4832
04:53:20,590 --> 04:53:24,830
That was rage. Total fucking rage.

4833
04:53:29,599 --> 04:53:41,549
Get it. Get it. Fight. Fight. Fight.

4834
04:53:44,689 --> 04:53:48,209
Mirrius, be careful in here. Mirrius. Mirrius, be careful in here.

4835
04:53:49,169 --> 04:53:56,290
Okay. All right. Mirrius, attack the archers. You're gonna be the block.

4836
04:53:57,009 --> 04:54:05,619
Can we get it? Fire.

4837
04:54:05,619 --> 04:54:07,220
The town is getting destroyed.

4838
04:54:11,549 --> 04:54:15,150
Where? Oh my fucking God. Where is the stupid building?

4839
04:54:15,150 --> 04:54:16,990
What are the gestures? For the love of God.

4840
04:54:17,709 --> 04:54:36,299
Where's the... We need you guys to stay alive.

4841
04:54:36,939 --> 04:54:41,360
Start killing. You can take it in a second.

4842
04:54:41,360 --> 04:54:48,180
You punched that guy to dust.

4843
04:54:48,180 --> 04:54:48,900
Take the town.

4844
04:54:49,540 --> 04:54:55,439
Oh God. How am I gonna capture this shit? They keep pouring people out.

4845
04:54:56,159 --> 04:55:00,700
All right. We're doing 55 fucking men.

4846
04:55:01,259 --> 04:55:02,849
Let's hope I can get them out there in time.

4847
04:55:03,490 --> 04:55:08,220
Mirrius, what are you doing?

4848
04:55:14,240 --> 04:55:17,439
Mirrius, stop fucking hitting that shit and go over and help them.

4849
04:55:23,250 --> 04:55:30,080
Oh fuck. Why are you hitting the wall, Mirrius, of all the things to hit?

4850
04:55:30,080 --> 04:55:31,200
Why would you do the wall?

4851
04:55:32,080 --> 04:55:34,619
There's a guy sitting right here.

4852
04:55:35,340 --> 04:55:37,740
Do it again. Get on top of him and beat his head into the ground.

4853
04:55:37,740 --> 04:55:40,209
Do it. Kick his ass. Kick his ass.

4854
04:55:42,529 --> 04:55:44,720
Get on top of him. Do it.

4855
04:55:45,360 --> 04:55:51,009
Good. Good. Good.

4856
04:55:52,529 --> 04:56:03,619
Good. Capture.

4857
04:56:03,619 --> 04:56:12,880
No, stop going to the wall, man.

4858
04:56:12,880 --> 04:56:14,880
He wants to destroy the wall so bad.

4859
04:56:16,369 --> 04:56:17,650
We're so close to winning.

4860
04:56:18,290 --> 04:56:32,419
Who's left? I don't see anybody.

4861
04:56:33,459 --> 04:56:34,979
Just get everybody on here and take it over.

4862
04:56:35,700 --> 04:56:41,490
Handing out some pocket signs.

4863
04:56:41,490 --> 04:56:42,770
Rats, stand up for the wrong.

4864
04:56:42,770 --> 04:56:44,450
German chat has proved unfair.

4865
04:56:44,450 --> 04:56:46,130
Now we infiltrate his lairs.

4866
04:56:47,169 --> 04:56:49,520
I think I win.

4867
04:56:50,240 --> 04:56:58,000
They're taking this, but that's not going to be enough.

4868
04:56:58,000 --> 04:56:59,200
I got their capital right here.

4869
04:56:59,759 --> 04:57:02,959
All right, Mirrius, go ahead and take the walls down if you really want to.

4870
04:57:17,900 --> 04:57:18,779
Maybe he should just go.

4871
04:57:19,419 --> 04:57:22,830
No, because he's going to wake up.

4872
04:57:22,830 --> 04:57:25,540
And I have to get back on top of him and punch his face until he's dead again.

4873
04:57:26,500 --> 04:57:28,610
Let's give morale.

4874
04:57:29,330 --> 04:57:40,830
Who's clipping their nails in the background?

4875
04:57:41,869 --> 04:57:42,990
Does kind of sound like that, right?

4876
04:57:42,990 --> 04:57:43,549
Raise morale.

4877
04:57:45,009 --> 04:57:45,810
Take this shit over.

4878
04:57:46,529 --> 04:57:53,310
I'm a little out of breath.

4879
04:57:55,439 --> 04:57:56,819
Here he comes.

4880
04:57:57,459 --> 04:58:00,830
All right, when he respawns, just do it again instantly.

4881
04:58:01,549 --> 04:58:02,029
Here he is.

4882
04:58:09,090 --> 04:58:15,900
No, you're getting stuck on a building.

4883
04:58:15,900 --> 04:58:16,860
You fucking idiot.

4884
04:58:18,529 --> 04:58:19,970
He's getting stuck on a building.

4885
04:58:23,490 --> 04:58:23,990
Get him.

4886
04:58:25,299 --> 04:58:26,740
Yep, got him.

4887
04:58:26,740 --> 04:58:28,099
Yep, yep, yep.

4888
04:58:28,979 --> 04:58:35,840
All right, he got a couple of shots and that's okay.

4889
04:58:36,880 --> 04:58:37,520
More than one.

4890
04:58:37,520 --> 04:58:38,880
All right, you're good.

4891
04:58:38,880 --> 04:58:43,119
Just, Mirrius, Mirrius, Mirrius, Mirrius.

4892
04:58:44,080 --> 04:58:46,720
Get on top of him.

4893
04:58:46,720 --> 04:58:48,479
Get on top of him and beat his fucking head in.

4894
04:58:49,040 --> 04:58:49,680
Get on top of him.

4895
04:58:50,799 --> 04:59:00,860
Elbow drop.

4896
04:59:15,810 --> 04:59:16,209
I win.

4897
04:59:16,930 --> 04:59:22,830
I thought he was going to elbow drop him.

4898
04:59:24,270 --> 04:59:24,669
Eat him.

4899
04:59:25,310 --> 04:59:26,159
That's fine.

4900
04:59:39,869 --> 04:59:41,790
Being a new viewer is a weird experience.

4901
04:59:42,590 --> 04:59:51,970
I was just like spam for like 30 minutes.

4902
04:59:52,930 --> 05:00:00,369
All right, my lights are on.

4903
05:00:00,369 --> 05:00:01,169
We already went over this.

4904
05:00:02,049 --> 05:00:03,169
My lights are turned on.

4905
05:00:04,849 --> 05:00:07,330
My exposure is lower because I start streaming during the day.

4906
05:00:08,369 --> 05:00:25,979
Eat this.

4907
05:00:25,979 --> 05:00:26,700
Kick it.

4908
05:00:26,700 --> 05:00:35,970
I'm going to use my two minutes on an omega low.

4909
05:00:35,970 --> 05:00:37,250
Now that's a good use.

4910
05:00:37,250 --> 05:00:38,209
That's a good use.

4911
05:00:38,209 --> 05:00:39,650
Pick this person up and just throw him.

4912
05:01:18,419 --> 05:01:19,139
Aztecs.

4913
05:01:19,860 --> 05:01:23,869
I wonder if the old prophecy is true.

4914
05:01:23,869 --> 05:01:27,869
If the Greeks are the weak race brought to strength by a god.

4915
05:01:29,869 --> 05:01:34,750
If so, will they fulfill the next chapter and go to Honshai

4916
05:01:34,750 --> 05:01:38,270
where their separated Greek brethren wait for them?

4917
05:01:38,270 --> 05:01:40,349
Did Mirrius get buff?

4918
05:01:40,349 --> 05:01:40,849
No.

4919
05:01:40,849 --> 05:01:41,549
We've done it.

4920
05:01:41,549 --> 05:01:42,189
Victory.

4921
05:01:42,189 --> 05:01:42,909
He got fat.

4922
05:01:42,909 --> 05:01:44,430
Your evilness knows no bounds.

4923
05:01:44,430 --> 05:01:45,150
He died.

4924
05:01:45,150 --> 05:01:49,069
Well, he got incapacitated twice and apparently had a bunch of food in his stomach.

4925
05:01:50,029 --> 05:01:58,209
Do I just have him build a few houses?

4926
05:01:58,770 --> 05:01:59,569
But I got to get the free.

4927
05:01:59,569 --> 05:02:00,529
We got to go back to free will.

4928
05:02:00,529 --> 05:02:01,569
I'm going to lose free will here.

4929
05:02:02,209 --> 05:02:08,450
Look at how bad that looks.

4930
05:02:08,450 --> 05:02:09,490
It's like a zipper.

4931
05:02:10,130 --> 05:02:12,209
All right.

4932
05:02:12,209 --> 05:02:12,930
Hell yeah, I did it.

4933
05:02:14,369 --> 05:02:17,169
Are you sure you wish to leave the land?

4934
05:02:17,169 --> 05:02:18,689
Click again to confirm.

4935
05:02:24,220 --> 05:02:30,779
Leader, I've been hearing rumors that some more of our people survived the Aztec volcanoes.

4936
05:02:31,419 --> 05:02:35,819
Some elite archers managed to fight their way clear after we left.

4937
05:02:35,819 --> 05:02:37,180
We need to find them.

4938
05:02:37,180 --> 05:02:40,220
We need all the elite troops we can get.

4939
05:02:40,220 --> 05:02:42,619
We need everyone we can get.

4940
05:02:42,619 --> 05:02:46,060
Archers or not, they're on another land.

4941
05:02:46,060 --> 05:02:48,220
We must go and find them.

4942
05:02:48,220 --> 05:02:49,500
Yeah, archers.

4943
05:02:49,500 --> 05:02:50,459
What are we waiting for?

4944
05:02:51,500 --> 05:03:00,259
All right.

4945
05:03:00,259 --> 05:03:00,740
Twenty.

4946
05:03:00,740 --> 05:03:03,299
Yeah, that was a little bit of an evil level.

4947
05:03:03,299 --> 05:03:09,549
Preacher, 32% evil.

4948
05:03:09,549 --> 05:03:10,509
Age three.

4949
05:03:11,150 --> 05:03:13,759
He's now seven feet tall.

4950
05:03:15,380 --> 05:03:16,099
Fatness.

4951
05:03:16,099 --> 05:03:22,220
The lightest he was today was 592 pounds and now he's 2400 pounds.

4952
05:03:22,220 --> 05:03:25,340
That's like a car.

4953
05:03:29,299 --> 05:03:30,740
Fitness is actually not bad.

4954
05:03:31,380 --> 05:03:34,180
Hit points.

4955
05:03:34,180 --> 05:03:37,220
Final 45 because the number of bowel movements, 54.

4956
05:03:37,779 --> 05:03:38,979
167 kills.

4957
05:03:41,619 --> 05:03:43,139
Grain and villagers.

4958
05:03:43,939 --> 05:03:49,020
All right, we can do some miracles next time.

4959
05:03:50,139 --> 05:03:52,450
A little evil.

4960
05:03:52,450 --> 05:03:52,849
It's okay.

4961
05:03:53,490 --> 05:03:54,849
It's not full-blown evil.

4962
05:03:56,380 --> 05:03:59,500
Water field, water forest, build a wall, use creature rolls.

4963
05:04:00,380 --> 05:04:02,380
Undead legion, nut oil.

4964
05:04:02,380 --> 05:04:03,340
What is nut oil?

4965
05:04:03,900 --> 05:04:05,340
Undead legion and win the land.

4966
05:04:05,340 --> 05:04:06,220
What's undead legion?

4967
05:04:08,220 --> 05:04:10,830
Impressiveness was okay.

4968
05:04:11,470 --> 05:04:12,509
My vitals.

4969
05:04:12,509 --> 05:04:13,150
All right, we're good.

4970
05:04:14,430 --> 05:04:15,229
We saved the game.

4971
05:04:15,229 --> 05:04:16,110
Real Link, you got it.

4972
05:04:44,669 --> 05:04:45,229
No.

4973
05:04:45,229 --> 05:04:45,869
Opposite.

4974
05:04:48,750 --> 05:04:51,330
There's a lot of people right here.

4975
05:04:52,290 --> 05:05:02,080
Mega Man 2 is better than Black and White King.

4976
05:05:02,080 --> 05:05:03,759
There's some juicy towns to ransack.

4977
05:05:03,759 --> 05:05:05,040
I'm gonna like this place.

4978
05:05:12,400 --> 05:05:13,119
What?

4979
05:05:13,119 --> 05:05:13,680
Watch this.

4980
05:05:13,680 --> 05:05:15,200
You're wearing a cast.

4981
05:05:15,200 --> 05:05:15,919
No, no, no.

4982
05:05:15,919 --> 05:05:17,200
This is...

4983
05:05:17,200 --> 05:05:20,319
The rumors of the Greeks return are true.

4984
05:05:20,319 --> 05:05:23,680
My brother has sent me to make this island safe.

4985
05:05:23,680 --> 05:05:24,799
This I will do.

4986
05:05:26,080 --> 05:05:29,459
Oh, sounds like a tribal commander, boys.

4987
05:05:29,860 --> 05:05:32,099
We'd better start building now.

4988
05:05:32,099 --> 05:05:35,860
These Japanese seem to be formidable builders themselves.

4989
05:05:35,860 --> 05:05:37,860
And get some armies, boys.

4990
05:05:37,860 --> 05:05:40,500
They look pretty handy at fighting as well.

4991
05:05:41,779 --> 05:05:45,790
That's a pretty sick Nerf combat vest.

4992
05:05:47,310 --> 05:05:49,790
That's probably the best boy I've seen described.

4993
05:05:49,790 --> 05:05:51,150
50 warriors.

4994
05:05:51,150 --> 05:05:53,549
Now that's nice, boys, real nice.

4995
05:05:54,909 --> 05:05:55,389
What?

4996
05:05:55,389 --> 05:05:55,889
What is it?

4997
05:05:55,889 --> 05:05:58,349
I'm going to play with that toy.

4998
05:05:58,349 --> 05:05:59,549
This will be full of them.

4999
05:06:00,430 --> 05:06:02,590
What do you think about the toy?

5000
05:06:03,310 --> 05:06:05,950
So, you like your armies, do you?

5001
05:06:05,950 --> 05:06:07,869
Bow to the might of my armies.

5002
05:06:09,310 --> 05:06:11,759
It's got a lot of armies.

5003
05:06:13,759 --> 05:06:14,720
You love me.

5004
05:06:18,349 --> 05:06:22,270
Leader, you must start building a wall inside your influence.

5005
05:06:22,270 --> 05:06:23,310
I have to build a wall?

5006
05:06:23,310 --> 05:06:27,229
You finish outside it, but not in an enemy's influence.

5007
05:06:27,229 --> 05:06:28,430
I don't even have a creature den.

5008
05:06:28,430 --> 05:06:32,750
All right, we gotta start with the most important part.

5009
05:06:32,750 --> 05:06:35,709
And these guys will eat twice the normal rate.

5010
05:06:35,709 --> 05:06:40,909
So, keep an eye out on your stores by forcing from the tribute menu.

5011
05:06:42,270 --> 05:06:42,770
Okay.

5012
05:06:44,270 --> 05:06:46,959
All right, let me do the test.

5013
05:06:49,439 --> 05:06:49,939
Hey!

5014
05:06:52,939 --> 05:06:53,439
Hey!

5015
05:06:57,549 --> 05:06:58,509
Oh, I can't.

5016
05:06:58,509 --> 05:07:00,110
I need to unlock forcing.

5017
05:07:00,750 --> 05:07:04,540
Get some sleep by the trees.

5018
05:07:04,540 --> 05:07:06,139
Yeah, I gotta build some shit first.

5019
05:07:06,139 --> 05:07:06,639
Let's build...

5020
05:07:07,500 --> 05:07:09,020
Let's get a storeroom back here.

5021
05:07:09,580 --> 05:07:10,639
Let's put it...

5022
05:07:11,779 --> 05:07:13,299
There's a bunch of trees over here.

5023
05:07:13,299 --> 05:07:14,259
Let's put it right here.

5024
05:07:15,490 --> 05:07:18,049
They're planning to store for the future.

5025
05:07:18,049 --> 05:07:20,770
This conflict will not have a speedy resolution.

5026
05:07:21,569 --> 05:07:24,380
Clear this out.

5027
05:07:25,900 --> 05:07:26,860
He just threw somebody.

5028
05:07:32,380 --> 05:07:37,099
Nation needs resources, and this storehouse will be full of them.

5029
05:07:37,099 --> 05:07:39,979
You're a little late, Murius, but you used a good try.

5030
05:07:39,979 --> 05:07:45,099
They will store enough to keep the form of this conflict alive for years to come.

5031
05:07:46,060 --> 05:07:48,860
Okay, let's get tons of...

5032
05:07:48,860 --> 05:07:49,419
Huge.

5033
05:07:49,419 --> 05:07:51,580
I mean, like, just a stupid amount.

5034
05:07:51,580 --> 05:07:55,500
Their land will soon yield them all they require.

5035
05:07:56,700 --> 05:07:57,759
Oops.

5036
05:07:59,900 --> 05:08:02,139
Okay, now let's get a...

5037
05:08:03,419 --> 05:08:04,779
71 people can work on there.

5038
05:08:05,900 --> 05:08:06,779
I taught him that.

5039
05:08:06,779 --> 05:08:07,419
I didn't mean to.

5040
05:08:09,380 --> 05:08:11,380
Let's drop this in here because it's ore.

5041
05:08:11,380 --> 05:08:12,099
Just re-ore.

5042
05:08:16,000 --> 05:08:16,880
Go play with your toy.

5043
05:08:17,860 --> 05:08:18,259
Stop.

5044
05:08:18,259 --> 05:08:18,740
Don't...

5045
05:08:18,740 --> 05:08:20,020
Stop doing, like, the...

5046
05:08:20,020 --> 05:08:21,299
Just stepping on people.

5047
05:08:21,299 --> 05:08:21,799
Stop!

5048
05:08:22,180 --> 05:08:23,299
He's doing it on purpose!

5049
05:08:23,299 --> 05:08:23,799
Get up!

5050
05:08:24,580 --> 05:08:35,880
What's up?

5051
05:08:36,259 --> 05:08:37,459
You can play with the toys, yes.

5052
05:08:38,180 --> 05:08:41,330
You can play with your toys, but just please move out of the way.

5053
05:08:41,330 --> 05:08:42,529
So I can pick up this boulder.

5054
05:08:47,630 --> 05:08:48,130
There we go.

5055
05:08:51,979 --> 05:08:53,099
So now we got...

5056
05:08:53,099 --> 05:08:54,860
Let's put some people in the woods.

5057
05:08:55,979 --> 05:08:57,819
People just doing their thing.

5058
05:08:58,700 --> 05:09:01,259
Let's get, like, 10, 20 people on the farm.

5059
05:09:01,259 --> 05:09:01,819
Disciple farmer.

5060
05:09:01,819 --> 05:09:08,459
Disciple farmer.

5061
05:09:08,459 --> 05:09:09,659
Disciple farmer.

5062
05:09:10,540 --> 05:09:11,500
10 people in the woods?

5063
05:09:12,900 --> 05:09:14,099
Disciple farmer.

5064
05:09:15,939 --> 05:09:16,659
How many are here now?

5065
05:09:16,659 --> 05:09:17,860
Disciple farmer.

5066
05:09:21,540 --> 05:09:22,259
Work isn't filled.

5067
05:09:22,259 --> 05:09:22,979
5, 10.

5068
05:09:22,979 --> 05:09:23,939
Let's do, like, another 5.

5069
05:09:24,900 --> 05:09:26,099
Disciple farmer.

5070
05:09:27,840 --> 05:09:28,340
Hey.

5071
05:09:28,959 --> 05:09:31,889
We need to build some roads and some houses.

5072
05:09:31,889 --> 05:09:33,090
We're gonna do the houses back here.

5073
05:09:33,650 --> 05:09:37,250
Let me get your toys out of the way.

5074
05:09:37,250 --> 05:09:39,919
There's gonna be a street this way.

5075
05:09:40,880 --> 05:09:42,159
There's gonna be a street this way.

5076
05:09:42,799 --> 05:09:48,099
Two streets.

5077
05:09:48,740 --> 05:09:51,069
Two streets that meet into the main road here.

5078
05:09:51,069 --> 05:09:51,569
Sure.

5079
05:09:55,729 --> 05:09:56,130
Oh, here?

5080
05:09:56,130 --> 05:09:56,630
What?

5081
05:09:56,849 --> 05:09:58,639
What the hell was that?

5082
05:10:04,610 --> 05:10:05,009
Why is it...

5083
05:10:05,009 --> 05:10:06,209
Oh, he threw that over here.

5084
05:10:06,849 --> 05:10:07,409
Thank you, Mary.

5085
05:10:07,409 --> 05:10:07,909
I appreciate it.

5086
05:10:12,380 --> 05:10:17,299
Okay, now I got a big farm.

5087
05:10:18,020 --> 05:10:19,979
I need to build some houses.

5088
05:10:20,619 --> 05:10:21,819
Actually, how much tribute do I have?

5089
05:10:28,619 --> 05:10:29,819
All right, I want...

5090
05:10:33,470 --> 05:10:34,189
Don't I...

5091
05:10:34,189 --> 05:10:34,830
I already did that.

5092
05:10:35,549 --> 05:10:40,430
What do I want to research?

5093
05:10:41,229 --> 05:10:47,360
Okay, armory.

5094
05:10:47,360 --> 05:10:48,479
Our advanced soldier.

5095
05:10:49,119 --> 05:10:50,080
One man, one ball.

5096
05:10:50,080 --> 05:10:50,639
Voodoo doll.

5097
05:10:50,639 --> 05:10:51,139
Lamp.

5098
05:10:51,919 --> 05:10:52,419
Meadow?

5099
05:10:52,959 --> 05:10:54,340
What does a meadow do?

5100
05:10:55,299 --> 05:10:57,060
Animals can graze and flourish here.

5101
05:10:57,060 --> 05:10:58,740
It's an enhancement to the town.

5102
05:11:00,700 --> 05:11:01,200
Well?

5103
05:11:01,819 --> 05:11:05,700
Positive effects on the...

5104
05:11:06,659 --> 05:11:08,500
The town ham...

5105
05:11:08,500 --> 05:11:10,099
All right, I got to do the force pickup, right?

5106
05:11:11,360 --> 05:11:12,560
And forcing.

5107
05:11:12,560 --> 05:11:13,119
20,000.

5108
05:11:13,119 --> 05:11:13,599
What do I have?

5109
05:11:13,599 --> 05:11:14,000
150.

5110
05:11:14,000 --> 05:11:14,479
Yeah, I do it.

5111
05:11:15,200 --> 05:11:16,240
All right, I can now do that.

5112
05:11:17,200 --> 05:11:18,000
Plant market.

5113
05:11:18,720 --> 05:11:21,790
Okay, let's do...

5114
05:11:21,790 --> 05:11:22,830
Let's get a plant market.

5115
05:11:25,220 --> 05:11:25,720
House.

5116
05:11:26,340 --> 05:11:33,229
Maybe a...

5117
05:11:33,229 --> 05:11:34,110
I don't want to hovel.

5118
05:11:36,270 --> 05:11:36,770
Tavern?

5119
05:11:38,259 --> 05:11:39,939
People need somewhere to relax and unwind.

5120
05:11:40,740 --> 05:11:41,540
Tavern?

5121
05:11:42,479 --> 05:11:43,119
A prison.

5122
05:11:43,759 --> 05:11:46,220
Draggs have sighted the corrupting criminal

5123
05:11:46,220 --> 05:11:47,340
that kept away from the populace

5124
05:11:47,340 --> 05:11:48,939
within these diank walls.

5125
05:11:49,819 --> 05:11:53,389
Maybe a nursery.

5126
05:11:53,389 --> 05:11:54,189
I need this so bad.

5127
05:11:54,909 --> 05:11:57,680
All right, let's settle down here.

5128
05:11:59,889 --> 05:12:00,930
Yeah, settle down, settle down.

5129
05:12:00,930 --> 05:12:02,209
Now I got a lot of opportunity.

5130
05:12:02,209 --> 05:12:03,569
We got a real link.

5131
05:12:03,569 --> 05:12:04,069
Cool.

5132
05:12:04,610 --> 05:12:09,000
Save it here.

5133
05:12:09,540 --> 05:12:16,540
All right, have we settled down?

5134
05:12:16,540 --> 05:12:18,139
Have we settled down, everybody?

5135
05:12:18,139 --> 05:12:21,569
Did you get it out of your system?

5136
05:12:21,569 --> 05:12:24,209
Did you like scream into the bag long enough?

5137
05:12:24,209 --> 05:12:28,610
Are we functioning again?

5138
05:12:28,610 --> 05:12:34,400
Get this.

5139
05:12:35,180 --> 05:12:38,830
Oh, I need a creature den.

5140
05:12:39,389 --> 05:12:43,060
Oh, look.

5141
05:12:43,060 --> 05:12:43,779
A town right here.

5142
05:12:44,979 --> 05:12:46,020
Let's influence this town.

5143
05:12:46,020 --> 05:12:47,540
I'm not going to destroy this one.

5144
05:12:47,540 --> 05:12:58,380
Magical shrine of some sort?

5145
05:12:59,020 --> 05:13:03,599
I'm just a creature.

5146
05:13:04,860 --> 05:13:05,360
You're okay.

5147
05:13:15,439 --> 05:13:16,319
Influencer.

5148
05:13:16,319 --> 05:13:17,680
E-clown influencer.

5149
05:13:17,680 --> 05:13:18,799
No, not really.

5150
05:13:20,080 --> 05:13:21,200
Considering I've said,

5151
05:13:21,200 --> 05:13:22,319
can you guys settle down?

5152
05:13:23,040 --> 05:13:24,240
Settle down, please.

5153
05:13:25,459 --> 05:13:27,459
I'm the fucking substitute teacher in the class

5154
05:13:27,459 --> 05:13:28,900
of all like the bad kids.

5155
05:13:28,900 --> 05:13:29,459
You know what I mean?

5156
05:13:29,459 --> 05:13:33,060
Like, guys, can we just like tone it down a little?

5157
05:13:33,060 --> 05:13:35,060
And they're like, shut the fuck up, loser.

5158
05:13:35,939 --> 05:13:38,900
Okay, can, okay.

5159
05:13:38,979 --> 05:13:41,779
Said everybody, I'm Mr. Elbertson,

5160
05:13:41,779 --> 05:13:43,139
and I'm here to teach you math.

5161
05:13:43,700 --> 05:13:48,540
I'm not going to teach that math.

5162
05:13:48,540 --> 05:13:50,849
I'm not going to teach that class math.

5163
05:13:50,849 --> 05:13:52,369
They're going to fucking be mean to you.

5164
05:13:53,459 --> 05:13:54,580
You're going to try to connect.

5165
05:13:57,520 --> 05:13:58,159
Hey, teach.

5166
05:13:58,159 --> 05:13:59,919
Shut the fuck up and play the game.

5167
05:14:01,759 --> 05:14:02,319
Hey, teach.

5168
05:14:03,040 --> 05:14:03,840
You're a loser.

5169
05:14:04,909 --> 05:14:05,470
You suck.

5170
05:14:06,189 --> 05:14:10,580
I ain't doing shit today.

5171
05:14:10,580 --> 05:14:11,299
Nobody does that.

5172
05:14:11,939 --> 05:14:21,490
Hey, that doesn't happen in classrooms.

5173
05:14:21,490 --> 05:14:23,810
I haven't been in a classroom in 25 years.

5174
05:14:24,450 --> 05:14:26,049
I have no idea what kids do these days.

5175
05:14:26,529 --> 05:14:37,180
He always hit that lady.

5176
05:14:37,180 --> 05:14:37,500
All right.

5177
05:14:37,500 --> 05:14:37,900
Keep going.

5178
05:14:37,900 --> 05:14:38,220
Keep going.

5179
05:14:38,220 --> 05:14:38,540
Keep going.

5180
05:14:38,540 --> 05:14:39,340
No more distractions.

5181
05:14:39,340 --> 05:14:40,380
No more distractions.

5182
05:14:40,380 --> 05:14:41,580
Wait, he did hit that lady.

5183
05:14:42,139 --> 05:14:44,700
He's playing peek-a-boo?

5184
05:14:44,700 --> 05:14:45,580
Why is he scared?

5185
05:14:46,619 --> 05:14:52,060
I'm going to play with that toy.

5186
05:14:52,060 --> 05:14:52,299
Good.

5187
05:14:52,860 --> 05:14:53,099
All right.

5188
05:14:53,099 --> 05:14:55,520
Let's focus, focus, focus, focus.

5189
05:14:55,520 --> 05:14:56,959
I need A.

5190
05:14:57,840 --> 05:15:05,169
Let's do a nursery for the new kids.

5191
05:15:05,169 --> 05:15:07,389
I'm going to go right over here.

5192
05:15:07,389 --> 05:15:08,110
That's fine.

5193
05:15:08,110 --> 05:15:11,470
Children are the future and need to be looked after.

5194
05:15:12,110 --> 05:15:14,270
So there are city builders.

5195
05:15:14,270 --> 05:15:15,549
They're not much my size.

5196
05:15:15,549 --> 05:15:16,590
Absolutely.

5197
05:15:16,590 --> 05:15:17,950
Please pull on the toy.

5198
05:15:20,110 --> 05:15:20,349
Yes.

5199
05:15:20,909 --> 05:15:21,150
Right.

5200
05:15:22,029 --> 05:15:22,669
Absolutely.

5201
05:15:45,009 --> 05:15:47,009
It was a false alarm.

5202
05:15:50,000 --> 05:15:51,439
I've been in that position before.

5203
05:15:55,150 --> 05:15:56,270
No, he didn't.

5204
05:15:56,270 --> 05:15:57,150
No, it's this.

5205
05:15:57,150 --> 05:15:58,669
I don't like to take spells.

5206
05:15:59,549 --> 05:16:01,169
Well, maybe you shouldn't shit on it.

5207
05:16:03,040 --> 05:16:03,360
Okay.

5208
05:16:03,360 --> 05:16:04,159
I need wood.

5209
05:16:07,900 --> 05:16:08,380
Yes.

5210
05:16:08,380 --> 05:16:09,900
Please help me construct the wood.

5211
05:16:11,020 --> 05:16:11,759
All right.

5212
05:16:11,759 --> 05:16:12,000
Yes.

5213
05:16:12,000 --> 05:16:12,479
Get out of the way.

5214
05:16:12,479 --> 05:16:14,400
You picked up like three twigs, dude.

5215
05:16:15,200 --> 05:16:23,549
Wait, what happened?

5216
05:16:23,549 --> 05:16:24,590
Did I get killed?

5217
05:16:25,310 --> 05:16:31,970
We good?

5218
05:16:31,970 --> 05:16:33,279
Are we good?

5219
05:16:34,159 --> 05:16:36,720
What happened?

5220
05:16:38,080 --> 05:16:44,619
All right.

5221
05:16:44,619 --> 05:16:45,580
Let's get some houses built.

5222
05:16:47,139 --> 05:16:48,500
We need some real houses.

5223
05:16:48,500 --> 05:16:52,099
Future generations of Greeks arrive in this land.

5224
05:16:52,099 --> 05:16:53,380
House, house, house, house.

5225
05:16:53,380 --> 05:16:54,340
Just a regular house.

5226
05:16:54,340 --> 05:16:55,220
Here we go.

5227
05:16:55,220 --> 05:16:55,459
Boom.

5228
05:16:56,180 --> 05:16:58,700
Are we good?

5229
05:16:59,340 --> 05:17:02,139
All right.

5230
05:17:02,139 --> 05:17:05,979
I want to do houses like this on either side.

5231
05:17:07,619 --> 05:17:07,939
Like that.

5232
05:17:08,580 --> 05:17:11,619
The Greeks wish to house their people.

5233
05:17:11,619 --> 05:17:13,220
This shows foresight.

5234
05:17:14,819 --> 05:17:17,340
We can now house our people.

5235
05:17:18,060 --> 05:17:18,619
Excellent.

5236
05:17:19,500 --> 05:17:21,569
Okay.

5237
05:17:21,569 --> 05:17:22,450
Same thing on the other side.

5238
05:17:23,409 --> 05:17:25,090
Jeremy, never leave us again.

5239
05:17:25,090 --> 05:17:25,409
I'm sorry.

5240
05:17:25,409 --> 05:17:25,729
I didn't.

5241
05:17:25,729 --> 05:17:26,369
I don't know what happened.

5242
05:17:27,169 --> 05:17:37,060
He's helping.

5243
05:17:53,040 --> 05:17:54,799
We're going to have a lot of kids.

5244
05:17:55,520 --> 05:18:05,759
One more.

5245
05:18:05,759 --> 05:18:06,080
All right.

5246
05:18:06,080 --> 05:18:07,200
We got a lot of houses here.

5247
05:18:07,919 --> 05:18:12,340
We need wood and lots of it.

5248
05:18:12,340 --> 05:18:12,740
Who's not?

5249
05:18:12,740 --> 05:18:13,299
Is anybody?

5250
05:18:13,299 --> 05:18:14,580
We need some foresters.

5251
05:18:15,060 --> 05:18:16,259
They're all foresters.

5252
05:18:19,790 --> 05:18:20,029
Shit.

5253
05:18:20,029 --> 05:18:21,470
Run out of wood here.

5254
05:18:23,729 --> 05:18:25,490
Let them settle in their houses.

5255
05:18:26,130 --> 05:18:26,770
Soon.

5256
05:18:26,770 --> 05:18:27,090
Wink.

5257
05:18:27,090 --> 05:18:42,340
I'm changing Wink to just like angry.

5258
05:18:42,340 --> 05:18:43,220
It's demonic.

5259
05:18:51,500 --> 05:18:53,599
Who was that?

5260
05:18:53,599 --> 05:18:54,799
Was that even you, dude?

5261
05:19:05,330 --> 05:19:06,290
We're going to run out of trees.

5262
05:19:16,610 --> 05:19:18,770
Greek holds seem uneasy for.

5263
05:19:20,450 --> 05:19:21,250
Stop hurting people.

5264
05:19:21,250 --> 05:19:21,889
You're hurting people.

5265
05:19:21,889 --> 05:19:22,389
Stop.

5266
05:19:26,740 --> 05:19:27,939
What if I just don't build any?

5267
05:19:29,220 --> 05:19:32,099
If I don't build any like war machines or factories,

5268
05:19:32,099 --> 05:19:33,380
won't that mean I'm not a threat?

5269
05:19:34,259 --> 05:19:36,099
We can be friends and stuff, right?

5270
05:19:36,819 --> 05:19:44,779
But it doesn't have to be violence like last time.

5271
05:19:45,900 --> 05:19:46,380
What if we?

5272
05:19:47,419 --> 05:19:49,419
We have homes for our warriors.

5273
05:19:49,419 --> 05:19:52,299
Although they choose to be on the battlefield.

5274
05:19:54,139 --> 05:19:55,500
Still need to build that wall.

5275
05:19:57,099 --> 05:19:59,900
I got a lot of houses.

5276
05:19:59,900 --> 05:20:00,779
Time to make some breeding.

5277
05:20:01,900 --> 05:20:06,770
Not being very helpful right now.

5278
05:20:07,330 --> 05:20:14,020
I estimated them.

5279
05:20:14,099 --> 05:20:15,779
Their tongue grows quickly.

5280
05:20:18,610 --> 05:20:19,810
Yeah, I got to start doing.

5281
05:20:19,810 --> 05:20:20,849
People have to start breeding.

5282
05:20:34,689 --> 05:20:36,049
How far into webcam?

5283
05:20:36,849 --> 05:20:40,819
I mean, it's going to start.

5284
05:20:40,819 --> 05:20:42,979
You're just going to start to make me fucking laugh out loud.

5285
05:20:52,290 --> 05:20:53,090
Water miracle.

5286
05:20:54,209 --> 05:20:55,889
Okay, let's do water miracle.

5287
05:20:55,889 --> 05:20:56,290
I can't.

5288
05:20:56,290 --> 05:20:57,330
I need to have a little worship.

5289
05:20:59,090 --> 05:21:00,290
You hate me.

5290
05:21:00,290 --> 05:21:01,409
You hate me.

5291
05:21:01,409 --> 05:21:02,290
You hate me.

5292
05:21:02,849 --> 05:21:04,130
That was depressing.

5293
05:21:11,700 --> 05:21:12,200
Look, see?

5294
05:21:19,150 --> 05:21:19,950
Breathe.

5295
05:21:19,950 --> 05:21:20,450
Let's go.

5296
05:21:21,310 --> 05:21:21,810
Breeding.

5297
05:21:26,639 --> 05:21:29,200
Start that population.

5298
05:21:35,869 --> 05:21:39,840
Breed, breed, breed, breed, breed.

5299
05:21:40,799 --> 05:21:41,299
Breeding.

5300
05:21:43,759 --> 05:21:44,259
More.

5301
05:21:45,200 --> 05:21:45,919
We need plenty.

5302
05:21:45,919 --> 05:21:47,200
We need people to live in these houses.

5303
05:21:48,080 --> 05:21:51,279
All right, that looks good for now.

5304
05:21:54,369 --> 05:21:54,869
Dancing?

5305
05:21:57,119 --> 05:22:01,330
All right, they all dropped it.

5306
05:22:03,099 --> 05:22:18,139
Okay, looking good.

5307
05:22:18,139 --> 05:22:18,860
We got a lot.

5308
05:22:18,860 --> 05:22:19,580
Let's do the.

5309
05:22:19,580 --> 05:22:21,580
Let's get some worshipers here.

5310
05:22:22,459 --> 05:22:25,139
At least this is how it merits is happy.

5311
05:22:25,139 --> 05:22:26,020
That's good.

5312
05:22:26,020 --> 05:22:27,060
All right, what else do I want?

5313
05:22:27,860 --> 05:22:29,299
I don't want to make an armory right now.

5314
05:22:30,259 --> 05:22:33,680
I need to make a temple.

5315
05:22:34,240 --> 05:22:42,479
I'm just going to go back here behind the altar.

5316
05:22:43,119 --> 05:22:43,619
Yep.

5317
05:22:44,240 --> 05:22:44,740
Yep.

5318
05:22:47,580 --> 05:22:49,979
Praise all the gods you wish, Greeks.

5319
05:22:50,860 --> 05:22:52,540
They will not aid you now.

5320
05:22:53,340 --> 05:22:59,150
Are we going to get a cringy mode?

5321
05:23:01,330 --> 05:23:01,830
Never.

5322
05:23:02,450 --> 05:23:03,250
That's never going to happen.

5323
05:23:04,529 --> 05:23:12,159
We need to influence over here.

5324
05:23:13,090 --> 05:23:14,369
Actually, I can do this now, right?

5325
05:23:14,369 --> 05:23:14,869
Yeah.

5326
05:23:14,869 --> 05:23:15,810
Let's do this little side quest.

5327
05:23:16,369 --> 05:23:30,459
Student one, it has time for your test.

5328
05:23:32,860 --> 05:23:41,060
Destroy the blocks using your chi.

5329
05:23:41,060 --> 05:23:41,619
I don't want to do that.

5330
05:23:41,619 --> 05:23:42,659
Focus, boy.

5331
05:23:44,819 --> 05:23:49,580
What do I have to do?

5332
05:23:49,580 --> 05:24:05,650
It's got to hurt.

5333
05:24:05,650 --> 05:24:06,529
Poor fellow.

5334
05:24:06,529 --> 05:24:09,650
Perhaps you could help by destroying the blocks for him, leader.

5335
05:24:09,650 --> 05:24:10,049
I could do that.

5336
05:24:10,049 --> 05:24:12,610
Usually, I wouldn't agree with being a thief.

5337
05:24:12,610 --> 05:24:16,610
But when it comes to destruction, I just can't say no.

5338
05:24:19,360 --> 05:24:19,860
All right.

5339
05:24:20,659 --> 05:24:22,119
I'll destroy it.

5340
05:24:28,529 --> 05:24:29,569
What do you want me to do?

5341
05:24:29,569 --> 05:24:30,290
Like, grab it?

5342
05:24:31,090 --> 05:24:37,459
You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5343
05:24:38,180 --> 05:24:40,979
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5344
05:24:41,619 --> 05:24:43,700
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5345
05:24:44,979 --> 05:24:45,479
Bash it?

5346
05:24:46,340 --> 05:24:47,619
How do I bash it?

5347
05:24:56,020 --> 05:24:57,430
I can't, like, move around?

5348
05:24:57,430 --> 05:24:57,930
No, no, no.

5349
05:24:58,549 --> 05:25:00,630
Focus your chi, student.

5350
05:25:02,340 --> 05:25:07,840
Uh, forcing brings your hand to the physics room.

5351
05:25:07,840 --> 05:25:08,479
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5352
05:25:08,479 --> 05:25:11,520
Press and hold the action button in a clear area to engage forcing.

5353
05:25:11,520 --> 05:25:14,400
Gently, gentle movement will nudge things.

5354
05:25:15,520 --> 05:25:16,020
Wait.

5355
05:25:16,479 --> 05:25:32,580
Hold.

5356
05:25:33,119 --> 05:25:34,400
Okay, I'm holding the button down.

5357
05:25:36,450 --> 05:25:36,950
Nudge.

5358
05:25:40,119 --> 05:25:43,220
Is this what I'm supposed to be doing?

5359
05:25:44,259 --> 05:25:46,229
And then hit it when he...

5360
05:25:47,270 --> 05:25:50,520
Okay, well, let's try it again.

5361
05:25:51,959 --> 05:25:59,750
Okay, here we go.

5362
05:26:09,430 --> 05:26:13,750
You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5363
05:26:14,229 --> 05:26:17,029
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5364
05:26:17,590 --> 05:26:20,549
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5365
05:26:20,549 --> 05:26:29,830
Okay, he did that on his own.

5366
05:26:29,830 --> 05:26:30,330
I didn't do that.

5367
05:26:38,080 --> 05:26:38,880
He actually just did that.

5368
05:26:38,880 --> 05:26:39,840
I didn't do anything.

5369
05:26:39,840 --> 05:26:43,459
Excellent.

5370
05:26:44,080 --> 05:27:01,720
You must work harder, student.

5371
05:27:02,520 --> 05:27:03,319
I don't understand.

5372
05:27:07,220 --> 05:27:08,099
I don't, I don't get it.

5373
05:27:08,740 --> 05:27:12,389
Like, I hold the button down and then I'm trying to, like, nudge it.

5374
05:27:13,919 --> 05:27:15,040
The quantum moon.

5375
05:27:16,000 --> 05:27:17,650
Yeah, leave it.

5376
05:27:17,650 --> 05:27:18,930
I was trying to stay on the rock.

5377
05:27:19,889 --> 05:27:21,490
Let's try it one more time.

5378
05:27:21,490 --> 05:27:23,009
I don't really...

5379
05:27:23,009 --> 05:27:24,759
I was doing it right.

5380
05:27:25,479 --> 05:27:31,720
Okay, I'm just holding the button down here.

5381
05:27:35,779 --> 05:27:45,029
You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5382
05:27:45,750 --> 05:27:48,630
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5383
05:27:49,270 --> 05:27:50,630
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5384
05:27:50,630 --> 05:27:51,430
Just hold it down.

5385
05:27:52,709 --> 05:27:53,750
I'm just holding it down.

5386
05:27:59,599 --> 05:28:03,490
I'm getting lucky three times in a row.

5387
05:28:03,490 --> 05:28:04,209
There's got to be some...

5388
05:28:04,770 --> 05:28:07,009
There was a weird ring that came up from the bottom of it.

5389
05:28:07,009 --> 05:28:08,130
Focus your chi, student.

5390
05:28:08,130 --> 05:28:08,849
Just wiggle it.

5391
05:28:08,849 --> 05:28:19,599
Press and hold the action button in a clear area to engage forcing.

5392
05:28:19,599 --> 05:28:21,279
Gentle movement will nudge thing.

5393
05:28:22,319 --> 05:28:48,560
Good work.

5394
05:28:49,279 --> 05:28:59,990
Um, why is it not working now?

5395
05:29:04,659 --> 05:29:06,900
You must work harder, student.

5396
05:29:11,520 --> 05:29:12,000
Gentle?

5397
05:29:12,000 --> 05:29:13,040
How is this not gentle?

5398
05:29:13,759 --> 05:29:16,560
Like, how is this not gentle?

5399
05:29:17,439 --> 05:29:23,880
Stay away from the rock, then move the hand close.

5400
05:29:53,540 --> 05:29:54,580
You were following me.

5401
05:29:54,580 --> 05:29:58,340
You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5402
05:29:58,979 --> 05:30:02,419
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5403
05:30:02,419 --> 05:30:04,500
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5404
05:30:18,130 --> 05:30:19,520
No, no, no.

5405
05:30:19,520 --> 05:30:21,439
Focus your chi, student.

5406
05:30:21,439 --> 05:30:22,639
Pull up the YouTube video.

5407
05:30:35,970 --> 05:30:37,810
Try stroking the rock while holding...

5408
05:30:39,169 --> 05:30:43,009
All right, I'm going to do this one more time before I have to go back and build buildings.

5409
05:30:43,009 --> 05:30:43,889
It's been like three days.

5410
05:30:51,990 --> 05:30:53,590
I'm not affecting anything right now.

5411
05:30:54,470 --> 05:30:57,430
Like, I have a fist right now and I'm not touching anything.

5412
05:30:58,470 --> 05:31:02,790
You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5413
05:31:02,790 --> 05:31:03,349
What is happening?

5414
05:31:03,349 --> 05:31:06,069
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5415
05:31:06,630 --> 05:31:08,709
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5416
05:31:19,240 --> 05:31:20,759
I have no idea what's happening.

5417
05:31:35,479 --> 05:31:37,639
You must work harder, student.

5418
05:31:40,150 --> 05:31:44,549
You may build cities, but nothing you can erect can match my cities.

5419
05:31:45,590 --> 05:31:49,639
Keep praying to your false gods.

5420
05:31:51,639 --> 05:31:53,400
Wait for him to strike and then do that.

5421
05:31:55,009 --> 05:31:58,529
A nursery to nurture the honorable warriors of tomorrow.

5422
05:31:59,970 --> 05:32:00,770
All right, it doesn't matter.

5423
05:32:00,770 --> 05:32:02,849
A magnificent temple.

5424
05:32:02,849 --> 05:32:03,810
Like my temple?

5425
05:32:03,810 --> 05:32:05,970
Respect from all outsiders.

5426
05:32:06,930 --> 05:32:08,930
Okay, I got some respect.

5427
05:32:11,169 --> 05:32:13,169
Let's do some worship.

5428
05:32:13,569 --> 05:32:14,770
Worship her.

5429
05:32:14,770 --> 05:32:15,270
Let's...

5430
05:32:16,209 --> 05:32:17,009
You, what are you up to?

5431
05:32:18,130 --> 05:32:18,689
Come over here.

5432
05:32:19,650 --> 05:32:22,049
Let's get you in the temple.

5433
05:32:23,009 --> 05:32:28,419
Okay, we got plenty of...

5434
05:32:29,139 --> 05:32:31,220
How's the nursery doing?

5435
05:32:31,220 --> 05:32:31,720
Good.

5436
05:32:32,180 --> 05:32:33,520
Plenty of room.

5437
05:32:33,520 --> 05:32:34,159
What do we need?

5438
05:32:34,159 --> 05:32:34,880
What do people need?

5439
05:32:36,020 --> 05:32:39,970
Food, desire, and homes are okay.

5440
05:32:40,770 --> 05:32:43,220
We need more food.

5441
05:32:44,689 --> 05:32:45,330
Water miracle.

5442
05:32:45,330 --> 05:32:47,009
Let's get this water like this.

5443
05:32:47,009 --> 05:32:47,810
Check this shit out.

5444
05:32:47,810 --> 05:32:48,310
Ready?

5445
05:32:49,090 --> 05:32:50,860
Are you sick?

5446
05:32:51,479 --> 05:32:54,279
There's more people on the farm.

5447
05:32:57,240 --> 05:32:58,439
Disciple farmer.

5448
05:33:01,990 --> 05:33:05,750
All right, all he's doing is throwing the bear back and forth.

5449
05:33:07,669 --> 05:33:08,549
What the hell is he doing?

5450
05:33:10,979 --> 05:33:11,939
Disband the army?

5451
05:33:14,959 --> 05:33:15,840
Can I?

5452
05:33:15,840 --> 05:33:16,340
I don't have a...

5453
05:33:18,930 --> 05:33:20,930
I think I need one of those war factories.

5454
05:33:21,569 --> 05:33:22,130
We'll do it.

5455
05:33:22,689 --> 05:33:26,959
Do some more watering.

5456
05:33:27,840 --> 05:33:32,840
More people in...

5457
05:33:33,720 --> 05:33:34,680
Oh, he's got a tree.

5458
05:33:35,479 --> 05:33:36,500
He's gotten big.

5459
05:33:37,459 --> 05:33:39,680
Disciple farmer.

5460
05:33:44,439 --> 05:33:45,479
Are these people foresting?

5461
05:33:46,630 --> 05:33:47,509
We almost have enough of them.

5462
05:33:47,509 --> 05:33:48,549
We're gonna take like two towns.

5463
05:33:52,069 --> 05:33:53,830
They're all going to bed?

5464
05:33:56,319 --> 05:33:58,639
We need a fucking road to go from here.

5465
05:33:58,639 --> 05:33:59,360
All right, what am I doing?

5466
05:33:59,360 --> 05:33:59,919
I need roads.

5467
05:34:00,560 --> 05:34:01,970
We get roads that come...

5468
05:34:01,970 --> 05:34:02,610
Okay, here we go.

5469
05:34:03,330 --> 05:34:07,639
Yeah, they might need roads.

5470
05:34:08,279 --> 05:34:13,009
I think they can actually walk.

5471
05:34:16,419 --> 05:34:17,700
We're going to gather that ore.

5472
05:34:18,419 --> 05:34:19,939
What is this?

5473
05:34:20,740 --> 05:34:24,959
Hey, will you fucking relax?

5474
05:34:24,959 --> 05:34:25,680
What is he doing?

5475
05:34:30,200 --> 05:34:31,080
Was the creature done?

5476
05:34:31,720 --> 05:34:36,560
Creature, creature, creature, creature pen.

5477
05:34:36,560 --> 05:34:37,520
There it is.

5478
05:34:37,520 --> 05:34:38,639
Let's put this one...

5479
05:34:39,279 --> 05:34:39,919
Let's put it up here.

5480
05:34:40,639 --> 05:34:43,959
Right on the edge.

5481
05:34:45,490 --> 05:34:48,290
They build a home for their creature.

5482
05:34:48,290 --> 05:34:49,970
I have never seen such a thing.

5483
05:34:50,770 --> 05:34:52,400
You don't have a creature?

5484
05:34:53,279 --> 05:34:54,000
How?

5485
05:34:54,000 --> 05:34:56,240
How is that possible?

5486
05:35:05,360 --> 05:35:07,599
Greeks have a formidable city.

5487
05:35:07,599 --> 05:35:09,520
My people must work harder.

5488
05:35:11,319 --> 05:35:12,040
Nah, I don't want to fight.

5489
05:35:12,040 --> 05:35:13,240
You've taken over the town.

5490
05:35:13,240 --> 05:35:13,639
We have?

5491
05:35:13,639 --> 05:35:18,040
Why would my people forfeit their honor and join the enemy?

5492
05:35:18,040 --> 05:35:19,159
How many people?

5493
05:35:19,159 --> 05:35:22,040
These people join us and take up our culture.

5494
05:35:23,000 --> 05:35:25,479
We will benefit from their strength.

5495
05:35:25,479 --> 05:35:26,520
It's five people.

5496
05:35:27,159 --> 05:35:29,000
There's five people there, man.

5497
05:35:29,000 --> 05:35:30,119
It's five people.

5498
05:35:34,740 --> 05:35:35,139
Thanks.

5499
05:35:35,939 --> 05:35:37,439
That's cool, I guess.

5500
05:35:37,439 --> 05:35:38,240
Thank you.

5501
05:35:38,240 --> 05:35:38,560
Welcome.

5502
05:35:41,669 --> 05:35:42,229
Good to see you.

5503
05:35:43,029 --> 05:35:43,669
Wait, hold on.

5504
05:35:43,669 --> 05:35:48,610
Their town is gone.

5505
05:35:48,610 --> 05:35:51,540
They're dismantling their entire town

5506
05:35:52,919 --> 05:35:55,590
and bringing five people over here.

5507
05:35:56,150 --> 05:35:58,200
I wanted to keep those buildings.

5508
05:35:58,200 --> 05:36:00,200
I would have kept those buildings.

5509
05:36:04,680 --> 05:36:05,240
Okay.

5510
05:36:05,240 --> 05:36:07,669
That's sure.

5511
05:36:07,669 --> 05:36:15,330
Whatever.

5512
05:36:15,330 --> 05:36:16,290
Come on in.

5513
05:36:16,290 --> 05:36:19,509
I see you taking the road.

5514
05:36:20,229 --> 05:36:22,630
Smart.

5515
05:36:25,319 --> 05:36:28,919
These Greeks are like any people I have met before.

5516
05:36:29,799 --> 05:36:33,189
Give me a flag.

5517
05:36:37,110 --> 05:36:42,400
Nah, I'm trying to accept you.

5518
05:36:42,400 --> 05:36:43,119
Give me the flag.

5519
05:36:43,119 --> 05:36:45,680
Our migration is waiting at our borders for you to accept.

5520
05:36:45,680 --> 05:36:46,159
Come on in.

5521
05:36:47,520 --> 05:36:48,319
Six people.

5522
05:36:49,990 --> 05:36:53,110
One, two, three, four, five, six.

5523
05:36:53,110 --> 05:36:53,669
Where are you going?

5524
05:36:54,630 --> 05:36:56,069
Come on in.

5525
05:36:56,950 --> 05:36:58,209
We've got plenty of room.

5526
05:37:01,759 --> 05:37:03,360
Now we build down here.

5527
05:37:03,360 --> 05:37:05,919
And then there's another place right here.

5528
05:37:08,759 --> 05:37:09,240
Look at this.

5529
05:37:09,880 --> 05:37:11,639
There's nine people in this town.

5530
05:37:11,639 --> 05:37:12,919
Let's influence this way.

5531
05:37:12,919 --> 05:37:14,520
We have a nursery.

5532
05:37:14,520 --> 05:37:17,990
The children grow and love us.

5533
05:37:17,990 --> 05:37:18,869
Great cities.

5534
05:37:19,669 --> 05:37:22,279
Where are you guys off to?

5535
05:37:22,279 --> 05:37:23,000
Let's get some water.

5536
05:37:24,119 --> 05:37:32,900
All right, Murius.

5537
05:37:32,900 --> 05:37:36,900
Can I give you a task or something?

5538
05:37:37,779 --> 05:37:39,299
He's just been whipping his...

5539
05:37:39,299 --> 05:37:40,500
Let's put you on gathering.

5540
05:37:42,450 --> 05:37:43,330
Here, gather.

5541
05:37:44,790 --> 05:37:45,669
Gather food.

5542
05:37:50,240 --> 05:37:51,840
You're so preoccupied with the toy.

5543
05:38:01,909 --> 05:38:02,470
All right.

5544
05:38:02,470 --> 05:38:05,599
Now, what do we need now?

5545
05:38:05,599 --> 05:38:06,159
Let's build...

5546
05:38:06,799 --> 05:38:07,919
What are we doing on population?

5547
05:38:07,919 --> 05:38:08,479
On houses?

5548
05:38:09,279 --> 05:38:13,520
Food.

5549
05:38:14,080 --> 05:38:15,119
Everything's doing fine.

5550
05:38:16,549 --> 05:38:17,830
No, why are people so unhappy?

5551
05:38:18,389 --> 05:38:19,990
Child population zero.

5552
05:38:23,700 --> 05:38:24,259
What?

5553
05:38:24,259 --> 05:38:25,060
What are you...

5554
05:38:25,060 --> 05:38:25,560
How?

5555
05:38:26,340 --> 05:38:29,889
I don't understand.

5556
05:38:29,889 --> 05:38:33,189
What's going on?

5557
05:38:33,830 --> 05:38:40,209
What are the kids?

5558
05:38:50,560 --> 05:38:51,360
Where are all the children?

5559
05:38:52,639 --> 05:38:54,880
A magnificent temple.

5560
05:38:54,880 --> 05:38:57,840
We'll learn respect from all outsiders.

5561
05:38:59,680 --> 05:39:00,720
They need beer.

5562
05:39:04,000 --> 05:39:04,319
Okay.

5563
05:39:07,330 --> 05:39:08,130
Tavern.

5564
05:39:08,130 --> 05:39:21,110
Let's put the tavern.

5565
05:39:21,669 --> 05:39:22,389
I want influence.

5566
05:39:22,389 --> 05:39:23,590
So let's put it down here.

5567
05:39:24,150 --> 05:39:25,250
Can I get it over here?

5568
05:39:25,250 --> 05:39:25,490
Come on.

5569
05:39:25,490 --> 05:39:26,689
There's a road right there too.

5570
05:39:28,290 --> 05:39:30,049
Murius, get your toys out of the way.

5571
05:39:30,770 --> 05:39:33,939
Right here.

5572
05:39:33,939 --> 05:39:41,560
What's this?

5573
05:39:41,560 --> 05:39:43,240
The population will be grateful.

5574
05:39:43,240 --> 05:39:45,000
Now you've built them a tavern.

5575
05:39:45,000 --> 05:39:46,119
I have to get rid of this shit.

5576
05:39:46,119 --> 05:39:47,240
Look at how annoying this is.

5577
05:39:47,240 --> 05:39:49,560
Allow our hardworking people to wax

5578
05:39:49,560 --> 05:39:52,200
and praise our culture through drink.

5579
05:40:05,080 --> 05:40:06,759
You'll need to work harder

5580
05:40:06,759 --> 05:40:09,080
to harness the awesome power of chi.

5581
05:40:09,799 --> 05:40:12,599
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5582
05:40:13,240 --> 05:40:15,720
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5583
05:40:15,720 --> 05:40:16,680
What, the smoke?

5584
05:40:18,119 --> 05:40:28,209
I mean, did the shit on the ring underneath it happen before?

5585
05:40:29,009 --> 05:40:29,889
No, no, no.

5586
05:40:29,889 --> 05:40:32,529
Hold the button and shake left and right until smoking.

5587
05:40:37,060 --> 05:40:38,419
Is this mission?

5588
05:40:38,419 --> 05:40:39,299
What is this thing?

5589
05:40:41,029 --> 05:40:43,189
Hold button down and shake left and right.

5590
05:40:51,169 --> 05:40:51,970
I saw the smoke.

5591
05:40:56,450 --> 05:41:01,250
You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5592
05:41:01,250 --> 05:41:04,049
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5593
05:41:04,689 --> 05:41:06,770
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5594
05:41:07,970 --> 05:41:23,779
Focus your chi, student.

5595
05:41:24,659 --> 05:41:26,819
I don't even know what this game is wanting me to do.

5596
05:41:28,020 --> 05:41:30,419
Like, oh, you can interact with the world,

5597
05:41:30,419 --> 05:41:32,500
but shake until there's smoke.

5598
05:41:32,500 --> 05:41:33,299
It doesn't say that.

5599
05:41:43,319 --> 05:41:44,599
Okay, I'm in it.

5600
05:41:44,599 --> 05:41:44,919
Touch.

5601
05:41:48,119 --> 05:41:49,000
Really shake it.

5602
05:41:49,000 --> 05:41:50,119
Really shake that thing.

5603
05:41:51,000 --> 05:41:53,459
Just do it at the same time.

5604
05:42:06,880 --> 05:42:08,159
Forwards and back.

5605
05:42:08,159 --> 05:42:12,159
You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5606
05:42:12,880 --> 05:42:15,680
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5607
05:42:16,319 --> 05:42:18,400
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5608
05:42:18,400 --> 05:42:19,759
Wrong at the same time.

5609
05:42:21,279 --> 05:42:24,229
Punch at the same time.

5610
05:42:30,740 --> 05:42:32,020
Just go up and down.

5611
05:42:32,020 --> 05:42:32,979
No, no, no.

5612
05:42:32,979 --> 05:42:34,020
In the name of god.

5613
05:42:34,020 --> 05:42:35,939
Focus your chi, student.

5614
05:42:35,939 --> 05:42:36,439
Tap?

5615
05:42:38,580 --> 05:42:39,080
Shake?

5616
05:42:41,139 --> 05:42:42,180
What the fuck?

5617
05:42:42,180 --> 05:42:43,919
No, put this down.

5618
05:42:46,930 --> 05:42:47,970
Read the other signs.

5619
05:42:47,970 --> 05:42:49,330
These other signs have nothing to do with this.

5620
05:42:53,189 --> 05:42:54,069
Dearly departed.

5621
05:42:54,069 --> 05:42:55,110
Dead people in the streets.

5622
05:42:56,360 --> 05:42:57,080
Empty towns.

5623
05:42:57,080 --> 05:43:03,119
Yeah, this has nothing to do with this.

5624
05:43:03,119 --> 05:43:05,119
Slide between all three rocks.

5625
05:43:05,919 --> 05:43:17,139
When I was sitting here going up and down like this,

5626
05:43:17,139 --> 05:43:19,939
there was a ring that was appearing underneath it.

5627
05:43:19,939 --> 05:43:24,340
You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5628
05:43:24,740 --> 05:43:27,540
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5629
05:43:28,580 --> 05:43:30,740
When I was doing this last time, it actually worked.

5630
05:43:32,259 --> 05:43:41,380
Good work.

5631
05:43:41,380 --> 05:43:55,759
I haven't changed anything.

5632
05:43:57,119 --> 05:43:59,279
You must work harder, student.

5633
05:44:21,279 --> 05:44:25,650
Do it in a circle.

5634
05:44:26,290 --> 05:44:30,290
You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5635
05:44:31,090 --> 05:44:34,450
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5636
05:44:34,450 --> 05:44:36,610
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5637
05:44:39,090 --> 05:44:39,590
What?

5638
05:44:40,209 --> 05:44:43,590
I- why is it working sometimes?

5639
05:44:44,549 --> 05:44:45,349
I saw the smoke.

5640
05:44:50,130 --> 05:44:50,770
No, no, no.

5641
05:44:51,490 --> 05:44:53,569
Focus your chi, student.

5642
05:44:55,799 --> 05:44:56,439
Up and down.

5643
05:45:01,080 --> 05:45:02,040
Shake harder.

5644
05:45:02,759 --> 05:45:15,599
Good work.

5645
05:45:17,040 --> 05:45:33,990
You must work harder, student.

5646
05:45:34,790 --> 05:45:40,900
Is there a YouTube video of somebody doing this?

5647
05:45:40,900 --> 05:45:44,069
This doesn't make any sense.

5648
05:45:44,069 --> 05:45:47,330
You basically can't stop shaking for a second or you fail.

5649
05:45:48,130 --> 05:46:04,930
You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5650
05:46:05,729 --> 05:46:08,529
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5651
05:46:09,330 --> 05:46:10,130
I'm not letting go.

5652
05:46:10,130 --> 05:46:11,090
The fist is closed.

5653
05:46:11,090 --> 05:46:11,889
What are you talking about?

5654
05:46:12,529 --> 05:46:15,409
Slightly larger- why would they make this like this?

5655
05:46:16,689 --> 05:46:22,580
This is the strangest video game mechanic I've ever seen.

5656
05:46:23,139 --> 05:47:15,459
You must work harder, student.

5657
05:47:15,459 --> 05:47:16,740
Just repeatedly punch.

5658
05:47:16,740 --> 05:47:20,659
You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.

5659
05:47:21,380 --> 05:47:24,259
You may try again when you feel ready, student.

5660
05:47:24,819 --> 05:47:26,900
Yes, Grand Master Kai.

5661
05:47:28,099 --> 05:47:37,569
Good work.

5662
05:47:49,169 --> 05:47:51,729
This is- going in a circle?

5663
05:47:51,729 --> 05:47:55,330
No, this is- shake, punch the thing.

5664
05:47:56,209 --> 05:47:57,959
This one's not working.

5665
05:48:03,029 --> 05:48:05,990
All these people are like, dude, get in a circle and go up and down.

5666
05:48:05,990 --> 05:48:07,029
Move it in a circle.

5667
05:48:16,000 --> 05:48:17,759
Shake it as violently as you can.

5668
05:48:18,479 --> 05:48:33,189
Received tribute.

5669
05:48:35,599 --> 05:48:36,720
Well, I don't care about the tribute.

5670
05:48:36,720 --> 05:48:38,560
I'm just glad that I've got real estate now.

5671
05:48:40,159 --> 05:48:42,020
Imagine trusting me like that.

5672
05:48:43,860 --> 05:48:47,779
The tunnel will allow our hard-working people to relax and-

5673
05:48:47,779 --> 05:48:48,259
Save again.

5674
05:48:49,220 --> 05:48:54,979
Hold on, I need to-

5675
05:48:54,979 --> 05:48:57,380
Praise our culture through drink.

5676
05:48:58,740 --> 05:48:59,380
Okay, tavern.

5677
05:48:59,380 --> 05:49:00,340
More follower.

5678
05:49:01,619 --> 05:49:02,500
Is the game loud for you guys?

5679
05:49:02,500 --> 05:49:03,139
It's loud for me.

5680
05:49:04,099 --> 05:49:06,229
What happened?

5681
05:49:06,229 --> 05:49:06,790
Why is it loud?

5682
05:49:08,229 --> 05:49:09,509
We gain strength in such-

5683
05:49:09,509 --> 05:49:10,709
All right, temple is almost done.

5684
05:49:11,590 --> 05:49:12,790
We cannot fail.

5685
05:49:14,150 --> 05:49:14,790
Water the plants?

5686
05:49:14,790 --> 05:49:15,509
All right, how's he doing over here?

5687
05:49:15,509 --> 05:49:16,229
Are you still gathering?

5688
05:49:17,520 --> 05:49:19,200
All right, he's gonna hate me for this.

5689
05:49:19,840 --> 05:49:22,500
He doesn't want to gather forever.

5690
05:49:24,049 --> 05:49:28,450
Drinking weakens the senses of both builders and strategists.

5691
05:49:28,450 --> 05:49:28,930
How much-

5692
05:49:28,930 --> 05:49:29,729
Okay, we're good.

5693
05:49:29,729 --> 05:49:30,450
What do we need?

5694
05:49:30,450 --> 05:49:30,849
What do we need?

5695
05:49:30,849 --> 05:49:31,810
Do we have food?

5696
05:49:32,450 --> 05:49:33,250
More food.

5697
05:49:34,209 --> 05:49:35,299
I got-

5698
05:49:35,299 --> 05:49:37,380
Okay, am I gonna just fucking pull it up?

5699
05:49:37,380 --> 05:49:38,180
I'll do it myself.

5700
05:49:42,930 --> 05:49:46,560
That's fine.

5701
05:49:46,560 --> 05:49:46,880
Water.

5702
05:49:47,520 --> 05:49:56,099
What did I just do?

5703
05:49:56,099 --> 05:49:56,419
I got-

5704
05:49:57,060 --> 05:50:01,409
All right, food is now not an issue anymore.

5705
05:50:01,409 --> 05:50:01,970
Water again?

5706
05:50:07,110 --> 05:50:08,470
Buy myriads of spells.

5707
05:50:08,470 --> 05:50:09,349
Yeah, let's go.

5708
05:50:09,909 --> 05:50:12,479
It's time to buy some spells.

5709
05:50:13,119 --> 05:50:18,290
Advanced builder.

5710
05:50:19,169 --> 05:50:20,049
Heal miracle.

5711
05:50:22,130 --> 05:50:23,169
Lightning miracle.

5712
05:50:23,169 --> 05:50:24,209
75,000?

5713
05:50:24,209 --> 05:50:25,090
Should I give him lightning again?

5714
05:50:25,090 --> 05:50:25,569
Like he used to.

5715
05:50:25,569 --> 05:50:26,689
He loved lightning before.

5716
05:50:27,650 --> 05:50:33,639
He's getting it.

5717
05:50:34,200 --> 05:50:36,279
All right, what else can I do?

5718
05:50:36,279 --> 05:50:37,159
Rest home?

5719
05:50:37,159 --> 05:50:37,720
Lumber mill.

5720
05:50:37,720 --> 05:50:38,360
That's what I want.

5721
05:50:39,000 --> 05:50:46,630
Are we doing on crops?

5722
05:50:49,270 --> 05:50:49,830
More.

5723
05:50:49,830 --> 05:50:52,259
We need houses?

5724
05:50:53,139 --> 05:50:54,740
Are we actually having children born now?

5725
05:50:55,540 --> 05:51:00,740
Happiness bonus.

5726
05:51:00,740 --> 05:51:02,259
How are there no kids in the town?

5727
05:51:05,509 --> 05:51:08,150
There's 12 breeders.

5728
05:51:08,150 --> 05:51:09,029
How are there no kids?

5729
05:51:09,750 --> 05:51:15,250
177 adults.

5730
05:51:15,970 --> 05:51:18,950
Is it-

5731
05:51:18,950 --> 05:51:19,590
Are we foe?

5732
05:51:20,389 --> 05:51:27,700
Do we need more homes?

5733
05:51:28,259 --> 05:51:35,959
All right, I'm doing it, though.

5734
05:51:35,959 --> 05:51:36,279
I'm-

5735
05:51:36,279 --> 05:51:37,319
Okay, I'm gonna do them over here.

5736
05:51:38,040 --> 05:51:40,500
I'm gonna have another street over here.

5737
05:51:41,299 --> 05:52:02,240
You're in the boring suburbs?

5738
05:52:03,439 --> 05:52:09,430
Oh, we gotta make sure we hit all these.

5739
05:52:09,990 --> 05:52:28,209
All right, let's go.

5740
05:52:32,069 --> 05:52:34,869
These Greeks are expanding their territory.

5741
05:52:34,869 --> 05:52:36,790
We must remain vigilant.

5742
05:52:39,560 --> 05:52:41,779
This game's so much fun.

5743
05:52:57,939 --> 05:52:58,500
How are we doing on-

5744
05:53:06,310 --> 05:53:08,630
I want to take this mission very, very, very slow.

5745
05:53:09,750 --> 05:53:12,959
You know?

5746
05:53:12,959 --> 05:53:14,159
I want to make sure we're prepared.

5747
05:53:14,720 --> 05:53:16,159
And I'm gonna use diplomacy first.

5748
05:53:16,979 --> 05:53:17,860
Not fireballs.

5749
05:53:17,860 --> 05:53:21,700
Not mounting somebody and punching them in the face until they're dead.

5750
05:53:22,340 --> 05:53:22,979
Diplomacy.

5751
05:53:26,720 --> 05:53:27,840
All right, we need a-

5752
05:53:27,840 --> 05:53:29,669
We're here.

5753
05:53:29,669 --> 05:53:33,360
Wait, wait, wait.

5754
05:53:33,360 --> 05:53:33,919
Better, better, better.

5755
05:53:33,919 --> 05:53:34,799
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

5756
05:53:34,799 --> 05:53:35,299
Ah!

5757
05:53:38,869 --> 05:53:41,750
Start the construction of the Siren Wonder.

5758
05:53:42,389 --> 05:53:44,819
Oh, this is bad.

5759
05:53:45,939 --> 05:53:46,439
What?

5760
05:53:48,840 --> 05:53:51,560
Noooo!

5761
05:53:52,119 --> 05:53:52,919
Okay, connected.

5762
05:53:53,880 --> 05:53:57,720
A migration is waiting at our borders for you to accept them.

5763
05:53:57,720 --> 05:53:58,220
Who?

5764
05:53:59,450 --> 05:53:59,950
Oh.

5765
05:54:00,250 --> 05:54:00,750
Hi, guys.

5766
05:54:05,750 --> 05:54:07,110
Pretty cool area you got here.

5768
05:54:11,580 --> 05:54:13,259
All right, finally, there's children playing.

5769
05:54:14,060 --> 05:54:18,659
All right, Murius is gonna get bored.

5770
05:54:18,659 --> 05:54:20,099
Uh, look at all this food.

5771
05:54:20,099 --> 05:54:20,819
Murius, you're done?

5772
05:54:21,540 --> 05:54:23,349
Please, just cease what you're doing.

5773
05:54:24,069 --> 05:54:24,869
Be an entertainer.

5774
05:54:25,509 --> 05:54:29,560
Just hang out in the middle of the town.

5775
05:54:29,560 --> 05:54:31,000

ex-war 2 thanks for the 250 germa don't let the fact that you can't figure out

6153
07:04:54,119 --> 07:04:57,840
the controls of a strategy game meant for baby children distract from the fact

6154
07:04:57,840 --> 07:05:04,119
that you instantly killed and mercilessly destroyed Chad Rack the kind

6155
07:05:04,119 --> 07:05:08,159
man who became a tree who helped you on your journey in sorcery book 3 at the

6156
07:05:08,159 --> 07:05:14,040
first chance you were given this game was this game was not meant for children

6173
07:07:19,700 --> 07:07:24,400
wasn't even today and by the way let me what the hell was going on today what

6174
07:07:24,400 --> 07:07:32,549
was going on today I look over at the chat room and people just going crazy

6175
07:07:32,549 --> 07:07:49,459
people were going nuts it was just like just spam for like 30 minutes I understand

6176
07:07:49,459 --> 07:07:57,130
spam is fun spam can be fun but I'm not sure there was one comment but anything

6177
07:07:57,130 --> 07:08:03,119
that we were doing it was just like copy pastas and people screaming at each other

6178
07:08:03,119 --> 07:08:18,099
and we got we got a we got a hit way omega low cringe community who cares

6179
07:08:18,099 --> 07:08:29,209
game sucks the game what how could you say that some of you guys were fucking

6180
07:08:29,209 --> 07:08:40,830
seeing red it was a wink I'll get it don't worry don't it's just it was

6181
07:08:40,830 --> 07:08:46,130
messy and it was going so fast too that's the thing it's not even about oh

6182
07:08:46,130 --> 07:09:07,680
wow there's some spam oh it was a hundred miles per it was just crazy this

6183
07:09:07,680 --> 07:09:17,020
is what it's like for you now it's not a community it's chat it's alright though

6184
07:09:17,020 --> 07:09:27,959
I just we're stream 2020 what are you talking about I like had a ton of fun

6185
07:09:27,959 --> 07:09:33,869
playing but they were non subs I don't believe that for a second I saw some

6186
07:09:33,869 --> 07:09:42,090
subscribers in there throwing mud at each other this game's fucking hilarious

6187
07:09:42,090 --> 07:09:46,729
and fun and interesting we talked about oh where's chat experience I see well

6188
07:09:46,729 --> 07:09:58,840
put it on the list put on the list put on six months up mode as the channel

6189
07:09:58,840 --> 07:10:02,439
grows and this is I know this is a road that I have to figure out what I want to

6190
07:10:02,439 --> 07:10:09,689
do about it and I don't think we've really talked about it but when when

6191
07:10:09,689 --> 07:10:15,240
there are there's really two ways you can really moderate a community I know a

6192
07:10:15,240 --> 07:10:20,639
chat room it's like either just let it fly and fucking it's whatever and just

6193
07:10:20,639 --> 07:10:24,439
anything it's just people just writing anything besides obviously the pain of

6194
07:10:24,439 --> 07:10:29,400
shit that you don't want your chat room or you have to really really moderate

6195
07:10:29,400 --> 07:10:32,799
and have very strict rules and potentially even have it on permanent

6196
07:10:32,799 --> 07:10:44,069
like sub only mode it's it's really difficult to balance in the middle and I

6197
07:10:44,069 --> 07:10:49,319
really don't know which one of them I would rather have because it's it's

6198
07:10:49,319 --> 07:10:54,580
tough because on one hand I want there to be people just engaging and having

6199
07:10:54,580 --> 07:10:58,700
fun and you know just talking shit and having a good time and being able to

6200
07:10:58,700 --> 07:11:01,619
write whatever they want as long as it's you know relevant to what the fuck we're

6201
07:11:01,619 --> 07:11:06,159
doing and like in the community or whatever but then you know you get to

6202
07:11:06,200 --> 07:11:11,919
the point where is it just like people writing just spam that has nothing to do

6203
07:11:11,919 --> 07:11:15,520
with anything it's just I'm just gonna write this because I decided to and which

6204
07:11:15,520 --> 07:11:20,900
one of those roads do you want to take and as this channel gets to a point

6205
07:11:20,900 --> 07:11:25,740
with is but sometimes it's you know five plus thousand six thousand plus people

6206
07:11:25,740 --> 07:11:32,099
at the same time I figure out how I want to do I want to have a more strictly

6207
07:11:32,099 --> 07:11:38,020
moderated chat that's you know very very strict and people we can actually read

6208
07:11:38,020 --> 07:11:41,020
the chat and communicate or do I want like a let's get a fuck who fucking

6209
07:11:41,020 --> 07:11:57,040
cares it's hard to do something in the middle 30 minutes slow mode 12 month

6210
07:11:57,040 --> 07:12:05,360
only mode that would be so bad I don't think it's even about more mods it's

6211
07:12:05,360 --> 07:12:17,919
just how I want the community and the chat to be enforced but you you get to

6212
07:12:17,919 --> 07:12:22,560
that the end of the road where there's the cliff there and like there's two

6213
07:12:22,560 --> 07:12:29,270
where there's two ways to jump they increase the moderation and maybe have

6214
07:12:29,270 --> 07:12:33,270
sub only on sometimes because this is like a shitload of potential this shit

6215
07:12:33,270 --> 07:12:39,630
lot of people here or just whatever it just take out like the bad stuff but

6216
07:12:39,630 --> 07:12:44,880
just kind of let it ride and have people say kind of whatever they want it's it's

6217
07:12:44,880 --> 07:12:55,119
tricky I don't mind chaos I mind people posting in bad faith just to cause

6218
07:12:55,119 --> 07:13:01,560
trouble but that what that but that's what I'm saying this with a highly

6219
07:13:01,560 --> 07:13:09,639
moderated chat that is almost it's hard for that to happen moderate the off

6220
07:13:09,639 --> 07:13:16,279
topic stuff and I and I can be sort of guilty of this myself because I like to

6221
07:13:16,279 --> 07:13:20,479
just say shit that people you know you guys will look over be like oh hey

6222
07:13:20,479 --> 07:13:23,000
something about this what about that and then I know people are gonna fucking

6223
07:13:23,000 --> 07:13:34,470
just start spamming and you know I'm saying that's fun so how do you manage

6224
07:13:34,470 --> 07:13:50,860
that too it's a lot it's I'm thinking about I'm thinking about it and I know I

6225
07:13:50,860 --> 07:13:54,299
thought this this is not I don't like having these conversations because but

6226
07:13:54,299 --> 07:14:01,830
you kind of have to have them because it's I'm not gonna pretend like oh yeah

6227
07:14:01,830 --> 07:14:06,150
there's people are fucking like screaming in the chat and there's the

6228
07:14:06,150 --> 07:14:10,990
same copypasta thousand times and the same link has been posted a hundred

6229
07:14:10,990 --> 07:14:16,630
times and there I saw one guy say something about the cow and it is kind

6230
07:14:16,630 --> 07:14:30,770
of there beater only mode I actually brought it well it's not that I haven't

6231
07:14:30,770 --> 07:14:34,729
brought up we talked about this last week about I'm gonna put a separate

6232
07:14:34,729 --> 07:14:43,869
place for links for images and I like having a fun chat and don't get me

6233
07:14:43,869 --> 07:14:50,189
wrong I fucking love the chaos but we might have to do some controlled chaos

6234
07:14:50,189 --> 07:15:02,990
chaos control as Shadow the Hedgehog once said and he was on to something and

6235
07:15:02,990 --> 07:15:19,139
this is I'm not like mad I'm not upset about anything which is it's just

6236
07:15:19,139 --> 07:15:26,490
something we need to talk about we got to talk about it I'm not mad as obviously

6237
07:15:26,490 --> 07:15:36,680
if I was you would probably know it's just as we go forward you got to think

6238
07:15:36,680 --> 07:15:42,939
about some ways to control the chaos but also let the chaos through let's see

6239
07:15:42,939 --> 07:15:55,479
he's disappointed no no no no not at all I'm not disappointed I'm not angry now

6240
07:15:55,479 --> 07:15:58,040
if you excuse me I have to mute my mic for a minute

6241
07:15:58,040 --> 07:16:11,040
I swear fuck go fucking every single fucking time I'm not I there's nothing

6387
07:34:46,790 --> 07:34:51,830

6388
07:34:51,830 --> 07:34:56,709
this shit you know somebody will do like a trans pride emote for instance and all

6389
07:34:56,709 --> 07:35:01,279
of a sudden it's like okay well let's have a gigantic fight in the chat and

6390
07:35:01,279 --> 07:35:04,560
we're just let's just derail everything we're not even talking about the game

6391
07:35:05,560 --> 07:35:15,400
and people are just fucking screaming at each other that this this is this

6392
07:35:15,400 --> 07:35:28,090
stream is for us to have fun and hang out and have a good time people will do

6393
07:35:28,090 --> 07:35:36,240
that don't care about trans pride no I'm well aware I'm well aware of all look

6394
07:35:36,240 --> 07:35:42,400
there are people that see a trans pride emote and they just fucking say

6395
07:35:42,400 --> 07:35:47,439
something horrible and then that gets a reaction of people that are just like

6396
07:35:47,439 --> 07:35:50,119
it's an emote and then that starts a fight and then that starts a fight it's

6397
07:35:50,119 --> 07:35:54,610
like fuck you fuck you it's like whoa whoa whoa whoa that's this is not what

6398
07:35:54,610 --> 07:36:02,799
we're doing here this is not what we're doing here we are not gonna have fights

6399
07:36:02,799 --> 07:36:11,930
about people's identities and people's fucking preferences and and and gay

6400
07:36:11,930 --> 07:36:18,389
straight trans that doesn't matter to me it shouldn't matter to you but again I

6401
07:36:18,389 --> 07:36:23,439
would like I said previously we got to talk about spam we have to talk about

6402
07:36:23,680 --> 07:36:29,990
people just writing shit and writing whatever they want and then going forward

6403
07:36:29,990 --> 07:36:39,279
how I want to moderate the channel German nihilism no more messages and you

6404
07:36:39,279 --> 07:36:48,209

07:36:57,599 --> 07:37:04,939
over and seeing that this just people fighting in this community about this

6407
07:37:04,939 --> 07:37:12,639
shit and it's not even why is it people even fighting over this I think everybody

6408
07:37:12,639 --> 07:37:26,470
needs to fucking kind of internalize this in maybe pump the brakes a little you

6409
07:37:26,470 --> 07:37:30,150
should block trans pride if it's bothering you no no that that's not I

6410
07:37:30,150 --> 07:37:35,740
don't why would I I'm not gonna ban emotes that's just that's absurd I mean

6411
07:37:35,740 --> 07:37:54,080
no that's not feel like I joined at a bad time no what this we're just going

6412
07:37:54,080 --> 07:38:00,240
over and I've seen it I've seen it and I've tried to kind of change the

6413
07:38:00,240 --> 07:38:04,720
conversation a little bit try to get away from people arguing and chat about

6414
07:38:04,720 --> 07:38:11,599
this stuff but I do want to make it really clear that I would like us to

6415
07:38:11,599 --> 07:38:17,659
fucking be able to get along I don't want people to be down to each other's

6416
07:38:17,659 --> 07:38:24,490
throats when I'm like I'm like fucking throw like I said I'm gonna use this as

6417
07:38:24,490 --> 07:38:29,369
a perfect example because it's a great example if I'm throwing rocks at people

6418
07:38:30,209 --> 07:38:38,509
and like eating people on screen if I'm like surfing on a way I don't want to

6419
07:38:38,509 --> 07:38:41,790
it's it sucks to look over and see people fucking hate each other it's just

6420
07:38:41,790 --> 07:38:47,349
not it's it sucks it's not cool I don't like it that's not what this community

6421
07:38:47,349 --> 07:39:00,819
is for it's not why that's not what this community should stand for we're here to

6422
07:39:00,819 --> 07:39:16,630
have fun and enjoy each other's company full stop end of story now we're here to

6423
07:39:16,630 --> 07:39:25,220
make fun of you and there's a difference between banter and people

6424
07:39:25,220 --> 07:39:30,279
actually getting truly upset at each other us walking around back and forth

6425
07:39:30,279 --> 07:39:47,790
we do it all the time people that have problem with the emotes should be banned

6426
07:39:47,790 --> 07:39:53,919
because they bring negativity well also I mean there's I talked to some of the

6427
07:39:53,919 --> 07:39:58,930
mods about it and there's potential of people writing like for instance like

6428
07:39:58,930 --> 07:40:04,529
the trance pride emote a bunch of times specifically maybe to try to bait

6429
07:40:04,569 --> 07:40:14,040
somebody to be angry with them I think we've gotten there and that's what

6430
07:40:14,040 --> 07:40:18,939
that's what happens and then real people then start to get angry with each other

6431
07:40:18,939 --> 07:40:43,060
we do yeah we did discuss that yeah internet doesn't change that's what I'm

6432
07:40:43,060 --> 07:40:47,279
just saying we have to be careful because you don't you don't want to start

6433
07:40:47,279 --> 07:40:52,479
fucking screaming at somebody and the mods are we we haven't had we're

6434
07:40:52,479 --> 07:40:56,759
supposed to be doing another kind of state of the channel mod meeting I'm

6435
07:40:56,799 --> 07:41:03,639
sure if it's something guys the discord have seen us in the Archmages tower

6436
07:41:03,639 --> 07:41:07,159
sometimes you just see a bunch of names and I'm in there too we go over stuff we

6437
07:41:07,159 --> 07:41:12,840
talk about this stuff and we want to find out ways to make it so it's

6438
07:41:12,840 --> 07:41:35,060
enjoyable for everybody it's it is still called the Archmages tower I love how

6439
07:41:35,060 --> 07:41:43,799
much we still talk about so it's such a huge part of my entire life but

6440
07:41:43,799 --> 07:41:51,340
hopefully hopefully we can start to move on from that because I've made my stance

6441
07:41:51,340 --> 07:41:56,400
clear that I'm in full support I think over the years you guys have heard me

6442
07:41:56,400 --> 07:42:02,799
say it plenty of times don't want to see you guys fucking hating each other not

6443
07:42:02,799 --> 07:42:15,919
here not at all and not ever we got to get over this shit anyways kind of pack

6444
07:42:15,919 --> 07:42:36,840
that on to the conversation we had like 20 minutes ago acting like what movements

6445
07:42:36,840 --> 07:42:42,180
were a political well I'm not even talking about like it politics versus

6446
07:42:42,180 --> 07:42:46,380
not politics versus socially I'm just saying in general my main problem is

6447
07:42:46,380 --> 07:42:49,220
looking over here and see people actually really upset with each other

6448
07:42:49,220 --> 07:43:00,540
because this is new this is only within the last probably six months or so I've

6449
07:43:00,540 --> 07:43:16,759
been around for ten years this is new I've never really talked about this like

6450
07:43:16,759 --> 07:43:23,049
this in this kind of candid way so why I'm spending a little extra time on it

6451
07:43:23,049 --> 07:43:43,290
anyways we will continue the conversation that needed to happen yeah

6452
07:43:43,330 --> 07:43:50,909

6469
07:45:33,099 --> 07:45:36,459

07:45:36,459 --> 07:45:40,740

your name every time all the swag thanks for this five dollars if you

6477
07:46:17,080 --> 07:46:34,380
thought about doing a test stream with stricter rules to see how it feels it's

6478
07:46:34,380 --> 07:46:47,709
so tough for me I just want it's hard yes I have absolutely sure do a test

6479
07:46:47,709 --> 07:46:54,159
stream on master of comedy people are gonna be worse I think that initially

6480
07:46:54,159 --> 07:46:57,720
something like that would be bad for a while but then people would just get

6481
07:46:57,720 --> 07:47:03,110
used to it and that's just that's just your chat after a while but the problem

6482
07:47:03,150 --> 07:47:10,319
is and here's the real problem I've been doing this for so long with the same

6483
07:47:10,319 --> 07:47:19,159
kind of rules for six straight years that that's a big change because I've

6484
07:47:19,159 --> 07:47:25,419
been doing it for so long if I just started streaming six months ago that's

6485
07:47:25,419 --> 07:47:35,459
different but we've had the same kind of rules for a long time so has it been six

6486
07:47:35,459 --> 07:47:40,779
years I started streaming on twitch my channel got partnered in like 2014 or

6487
07:47:40,819 --> 07:47:47,479
2015 I've been streaming on twitch since like 2014 or so 2015 he's like

6488
07:47:47,479 --> 07:47:58,369
that's when I got partnered we need more mods maybe we'll do like a fucking big

6489
07:47:58,369 --> 07:48:04,189
mod maybe I was gonna do a lot of apocalypse before maybe we need to do a

6490
07:48:04,189 --> 07:48:22,000
mod knighting ceremony mod lottery thermostyle is to have mods snipe out

6491
07:48:22,000 --> 07:48:27,389
the trolls but it's hard with such a big audience yeah I do not take this lightly

6492
07:48:27,389 --> 07:48:30,509
at all and I know people going well man you stand you've been a real long

6493
07:48:30,509 --> 07:48:34,189
fucking time on this it means a lot to me because I want people to enjoy this

6494
07:48:34,189 --> 07:48:40,200
stream I want you to be able to shitpost I want you to be able to fucking say the

6495
07:48:40,200 --> 07:48:44,319
things you want to say and have fun but you know I got a fucking reel it in

6496
07:48:44,319 --> 07:48:53,959
that's just that's it but we have one more here well no two more actually

6497
07:48:53,959 --> 07:49:00,000
Avery drop dead thanks to the 250 German if you could read this privately it

6498
07:49:00,000 --> 07:49:15,419
appreciated okay we'll do thank you for the 250 thank you everything is being

6499
07:49:15,419 --> 07:49:21,000
looked at and talked about so don't worry thank you finally uber morph point

6500
07:49:21,000 --> 07:49:25,000
thanks for the $15 1500 bits I sincerely appreciate your will to stomp out

6501
07:49:25,000 --> 07:49:28,759
negativity in your community so many content creators let those parts fester

6502
07:49:28,759 --> 07:49:42,810
and become worse I think I think the word like stomp out negativity is I mean not

6503
07:49:42,849 --> 07:49:56,569
necessarily correct because I don't want look if you tell somebody that they're

6504
07:49:56,569 --> 07:50:01,380
stupid and they're wrong and they're an idiot you bet you that you'd make that

6505
07:50:01,380 --> 07:50:19,830
person fucking even more angry and hateful you know I'm saying it's hard

6506
07:50:19,830 --> 07:50:27,250
trying to you know push people in a more positive direction but without

6507
07:50:27,250 --> 07:50:34,159
telling them like wow you are sure are a fucking idiot like oh yeah I'm a

6508
07:50:34,159 --> 07:50:53,610
fucking idiot huh you're a fucking idiot it's tricky nice political debate some

6509
07:50:53,610 --> 07:50:57,849
people just some some people and some people are just playing out to cause

6510
07:50:57,849 --> 07:51:04,849
chaos yeah I know that's why it's so tricky because like stomping out

6511
07:51:04,849 --> 07:51:08,450
negativity is like what if the negativity is coming from a place of

6512
07:51:08,450 --> 07:51:13,409
somebody just trying to make a problem because they haven't but that's what

6513
07:51:13,409 --> 07:51:18,849
they're doing for fun then you have like two potential negativity sources that

6514
07:51:18,849 --> 07:51:29,020
are coming at each other it's just just riling shit up yeah haha who would do

6515
07:51:29,020 --> 07:51:54,819
that you can't act like both sides are equally at fault no absolutely not like

6516
07:51:54,819 --> 07:52:01,380
if you're like a bigot or like a racist and shit like like yeah you shouldn't

6517
07:52:01,380 --> 07:52:04,500
fucking be like that like don't you don't be like that that's not that's

6518
07:52:04,500 --> 07:52:20,389
not good that's really not fucking good but it's sometimes not that easy to

6519
07:52:20,389 --> 07:52:28,599
simply just say those things because the person listening might not give a shit

6520
07:52:28,599 --> 07:52:49,919
about anything you're saying it's actually really tricky you ended racism

6521
07:52:50,080 --> 07:53:09,580
CEO of racism oh my god I was here all right all right you did it all right we

6522
07:53:09,580 --> 07:53:25,840
did it god but this stuff is hard to talk about because when I turn my streams

6523
07:53:25,840 --> 07:53:30,880
on I don't I don't turn my stream on with the idea of well you know I'm gonna

6524
07:53:30,880 --> 07:53:36,650
talk about a bunch of issues today let me talk about all the bad shit in the

6525
07:53:37,209 --> 07:53:45,470
world I mean that's not what I'm doing here that's not the point of this stream

6526
07:53:45,470 --> 07:54:00,000
it never has and it never will be but sometimes we can you know somewhere when

6527
07:54:00,000 --> 07:54:02,759
I feel comfortable doing it you know we talk about it like we're doing right

6528
07:54:02,759 --> 07:54:19,759
now stop to talk about it I've lost somebody wink points trying to get him

6529
07:54:19,759 --> 07:54:32,569
to read please say it again when there isn't what's not the end of the stream

6530
07:54:32,569 --> 07:54:39,159
most people who need to hear this message already left he's bullying me

6531
07:54:39,159 --> 07:54:53,560
what I didn't what I just read it it really bothers me that no matter how

6532

6535
07:55:14,159 --> 07:55:25,439
think about this all the time I do and I'm gonna be completely upfront and

6536
07:55:25,880 --> 07:55:33,490
