00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:24,920
Hey, April Fools. I'm not late today. There's the joke. There's the prank. I'm pranking you right now.

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:45,929
You're being pranked. Got ya. Oh man, you see your face. Oh, I got ya. How's my stomach? It's doing

3
00:00:45,929 --> 00:01:01,399
alright. It's doing better. Good enough to stream. Yeah, today we're going to be playing Breath of

4
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:07,859
the Wild. I know a lot of people thought this wasn't going to happen. I've been saying I was

5
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,780
going to play Breath of the Wild over and over and over again for the last three or four months.

6
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:28,219
And now I'm finally doing it. How am I supposed to work if you keep streaming? I don't know. Go

7
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:37,780
do what you need to do and then earn your own after. It's been two months. I think it's been

8
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:49,239
longer than that. When was the last time I played Breath of the Wild? How long? It's been three or

9
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:57,879
four months. Oh, the mods are having a little bit of fun here. Good luck writing the word the

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,890
because I think that gets you timed out. Good luck. Mods are going to get rid of all like the

11
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:19,400
fucking like like the all the only speaking vowels or what are consonants allowed? Is that

12
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:31,849
the right word? What's that word? That's other letters. Consonant. Yeah, apparently the channel

13
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:36,409
was an emote only for the last like 16 to 17 hours, which is I guess kind of funny.

14
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:44,550
We all got into the chat today and I was we were talking to mod chat and it's like, wait a minute.

15
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:51,699
Oh, it's just been on emote only all night and all day. Oh, well, I already left it on last night.

16
00:02:54,539 --> 00:03:07,050
Oops, 16 hours, bro. The words are the blocked words are now the is and how I'll put stupid on

17
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:16,340
there to put stupid, put going too slow, put the brain, put a ton of words that you know,

18
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,689
because nobody can say anything about my gameplay today. Take the word. I want gameplay.

19
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:31,560
I want gamer. I want gaming on that list. Only leave the nice words. Leave smart, talented,

20
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:43,610
funny, handsome. You know what I mean? That's all. That's all I want. Now we're just going to play.

21
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,460
Cam's not going to go on today and I assure you it's not a scenario where the cam is off

22
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,699
and slowly my room is going to get comedically sucked into a black hole and I'm going to turn

23
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,659
it on and be getting sucked into a black hole out a window or something that's not going to happen.

24
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,580
I know it's like April Fool's and a lot of people like expect something that's not happening today.

25
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:16,730
I'm just going to play Breath of the Wild. So there you are. I love OK, here are the terms

26
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,449
and phrases that are blocked right now and it reads like a funny story. Let me let me read you

27
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:27,930
the block list in in the order that I feel like reading it in. How is the gamer going too slow?

28
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:40,500
Brain sucks. Those are all individual blocked words. How is the gamer going too slow? Brain sucks.

29
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,370
Those are all words you cannot say today and I just happen to read them in an order that is

30
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:52,939
in order that I want to make sure it can't be written. Mods, just keep anytime you see

31
00:04:52,939 --> 00:05:00,040
somebody talking shit, just add that to the block list until it's only just like happy positive

32
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:17,029
energy. Positive vibes only. Smelly? Nah, that doesn't offend me. Keep that on. That's fine.

33
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:35,000
Just keep it going. Well, don't just say words. Come on. Bald? Yep. All I'm telling you is your

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,399
chat experience today is probably going to be a little fucked up. So just be aware of that.

35
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,959
I know somebody's going to write the word the get timed out and they're going to be pissed,

36
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,199
but just I just know it's a fun. It's a funny day today. Okay, it's a funny day.

37
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:55,459
Just don't worry. What about asymmetrical? Like asymmetrical face?

38
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,300
Old. Well, that's just that's a factual statement. So I mean, I'm not old. No, remove that.

39
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:14,019
Remove tiny. Yeah, they'll they'll get a good list going. Anyways, haven't seen this in a while.

40
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:27,639
Have you? I don't be really honest with everybody here. I have no idea how to play. I have no

41
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,620
idea how to play this game anymore. It's been like three months. What am I? What do I do?

42
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:57,670
I think I have this marked. Where was I even going? This is marked. Where's the next guardian?

43
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:07,829
Just reset. I'm not going to reset. Is it here? I think I wouldn't have marked that if it wasn't

44
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:19,860
where I was going. We're going there. I've got to play. Okay, I'm good. It's B to open the glider.

45
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:29,509
How do I grab a rock? How do I grab the side of the how do I grab? Okay, it's X. Why can't I hear

46
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:45,379
this very well? There we go. You're a noob. Put that on the list too. Wait, no, I remember I got

47
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:53,209
attacked by like lightning and shit. I don't think I can go this way. I remember. Don't forget to

48
00:07:53,209 --> 00:08:02,100
tweet. Oh shit, you're right. Thanks. I didn't. No, I didn't. This tweet sucks. Whatever. Oh,

49
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:09,129
did I lose my verified status? Do you want me to read you the draft tweet? That's never getting

50
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:19,019
posted, but it's a draft tweet. I haven't I had a draft tweet for when I lost verified status.

51
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,420
It didn't happen yet, so I can't post it because it didn't happen yet. So I'm just going to read

52
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:37,049
it to you now and then not post it. Okay, so this tweet is what does it say here? Okay,

53
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:43,049
drafts. Okay, this is what I was going to post when I lost verified status. It's not even that

54
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:49,929
funny, but I'm going to read it. Twitter removed my verified badge. How do I stop it? Is there a

55
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:55,259
questionnaire I can take? Can anyone lend a hand? Restarting my router didn't seem to do anything.

56
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:08,139
All my speed tests are perfect. I don't understand. That's pretty. That's all right. This is all right.

57
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:18,870
I think the funny part for me for that tweet is all my speed tests are perfect. Minus two is now

58
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:40,679
blocked. Oh, all right. Okay. All right. Look at that. Am I going to die from this? Probably.

59
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:56,519
Mods. Mods. They're finding a way to get around it. Fix it. I don't know how to play. I don't know

60
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,139
how to play the game. What did I just do? What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. How to restart

61
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:10,070
the game. That was the moonlight scimitar. What was that? Was that a valuable weapon? I don't

62
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:29,129
remember how to play. Is that bad? Should I actually go back? I'm going back. I have no

63
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:39,610
idea what that was. I don't. It's a legendary weapon. Look at this thing. Twenty five damage.

64
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,429
Are you kidding me? I don't want to do that. All right. Let's keep going. That's where I was

65
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:52,100
going anyways. We're good. All right. Let me figure. Okay. X. No, this is Y. Y is attack.

66
00:10:52,740 --> 00:11:03,129
B is jump. A is confirm. X is run. Left trigger is whatever this is. Is this block?

67
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:22,659
Okay, that's block. Left bumper is camera. This one's way better. Okay. Right bumper is

68
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:37,179
throw weapon. Don't do that. Right trigger is arrow. Up is powers. Left is shields. Right is

69
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:47,539
swords. What? Down is horse. But I haven't I haven't used the horse in like 40 hours of

70
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:53,799
gameplay. All right, let's go. I'm ready. This is a good skit. This is so stupid. You spelled it with

71
00:11:53,799 --> 00:12:06,919
S T U V money sign T U P 1 D. It's like you guys are trying to get around the name filter in video

72
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:15,799
games. How do I spell fuck face without getting around the filter? Oh, I'll do like, uh, E E F

73
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:33,299
F like F H, uh, U, um, Ampersand new voice on log.

74
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:46,340
It doesn't spell fuck face. E E F H U Ampersand. What is that?

75
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,179
Remove stupid from the fucking board pull immediately. I can see it over here.

76
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:10,899
Well, you never heard the word Ampersand before. All right. I already realized I'm chilling out

77
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:33,159
today. Hey, you know what? Yeah. How's that? What's Perry? How do I make it so it doesn't do this

78
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:43,990
weird globe? What just happened? This thing's about to break. What is happening to my character?

79
00:13:44,629 --> 00:14:01,529
What is going on? Why is this guy like harder than a boss? I'm getting hurt too. I'm cold.

80
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:10,940
I don't think it's supposed to go this way. I'm not I am not supposed to do what I'm supposed

81
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:18,360
to be doing right now. I'm not I'm not supposed to be going this way. This is not the way you're

82
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,399
supposed to go. I haven't played the game in three months. I don't know what route I was on.

83
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:43,669
I'm going this way. Do you know what they should make in video games? And I know people can be

84
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:49,509
like, oh, here he goes again. But listen to me. If the game knows you haven't played in three months,

85
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:54,629
I wish I could watch like a fucking recap video. Like a one minute recap like

86
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,980
that's in the background. We see you haven't played breath of the wild in six months.

87
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,580
Let us give you a quick crash course on everything that's happened and everything you need to know.

88
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:25,129
I'm doing this. You did your bit this bit already with Metal Gear Solid. There's a whole second

89
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:41,320
YouTube channel that you did this already. You read the sign, bro. For real, you just skipped

90
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:58,970
the entire oasis. So did I? Why are you so mean? All right, we will have a little fun today because

91
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:09,659
I would like for you to bet if I can beat this in 10 minutes. And I don't know if I would bet on me

92
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:20,419
right now, because I don't even know what the buttons do. I don't want you to see after three

93
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:40,379
months. There's no way. Well, then you know what to do. I would rather go broke a believer

94
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:53,419
than be rich and doubter. Wow. That's like really nice. That's like actually really sweet of you.

95
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:16,420
We believe in you. I hate you. Yeah, I know that all things must be balanced. All right. Are we

96
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:23,210
ready? In three, I'm looking at we make sure one of the mods has a clock. It's 10 minutes.

97
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:32,490
Three, two, one, go. I fuck. I think I give up. I don't know if I can do this.

98
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:58,339
This looks really complicated. I don't just put it down. Whoa. What? Oh, how do I safely? OK.

99
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:35,339
I need more barrels. What the fuck? Are there any more barrels? What is this? That goes over here,

100
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:40,220
which then this connects to here. I need way more shit. How am I supposed to get up here?

101
00:18:40,779 --> 00:19:27,099
There's only one barrel in this whole area. How am I supposed to do? I forgot I had this power.

102
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:52,059
OK, I need another barrel. What if I do this? Can I? Everybody wants to help so bad. OK,

103
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:57,509
so what does this do? This counts as electricity. Can I get this electricity? Oh, this counts as

104
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:05,130
electricity. This counts as electricity. Shit. Another barrel. That's not a shit scenario.

105
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:18,420
That's a nice. Honestly, R1. I'm so used to. OK, I got another barrel. This is going right here.

106
00:20:18,420 --> 00:21:03,289
How much do we have time? Am I good on time? Shit. I got to replace this right here. All right. OK.

107
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:30,579
What happened? What? What is going on? What the fuck? I walked over the. Now I'm just like,

108
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:41,210
all right, well, come on. The timer is still going. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

109
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,579
I'm working on it. I'm working on it. Why would you ever vote for me right now? Like ever? Like,

110
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:52,039
what were you thinking? What were you thinking today? You really thought this is going to work

111
00:21:52,039 --> 00:22:08,299
out? I'm surprised. What were you thinking? What are you doing? You're doing the pointing

112
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:38,630
and laughing emote. Who cares? Stop touching electricity, you fucking moron. OK. All right.

113
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:48,410
We're good. I got plenty of time. I got six minutes. Six minutes is a lot of time. Thunder

114
00:22:48,410 --> 00:23:04,069
blade. Oh, God damn it. Nice. Oh, this thing's Ricky. Ricky. Cool. This thing is

115
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:09,829
Ricky. Cool. What? I was going to say Rick, like from Rick and Morty.

116
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:25,819
It's wicked. Cool. How do I open that? I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

117
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:40,549
Oh, dude, I forgot to tell you guys, I turned on the new Space Jam movie

118
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,779
and I couldn't follow anything that was going on. I hadn't. I actually had no idea what was

119
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:59,740
happening in the movie. The first 50 minutes of that movie were just, it reminded me of like

120
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,220
Kingdom Hearts in a way. But Kingdom Hearts just kind of did it way better. It was like, oh, hey,

121
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,619
look, we're going to, hey, I just want to let you know that we, there's a character that is cool.

122
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:15,539
We're going to go to their world for 15 minutes and then we're going to leave. And by the way,

123
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:20,230
it's just the fucking Looney Tunes. None of the other characters do anything. Let's go to the

124
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,690
Batman world for like five fucking five minutes and that's it. Batman's not going to be in the

125
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,230
fucking movie, by the way. It's only, it's just the Looney Tunes. We're just going to go visit

126
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,730
every world, Kingdom Hearts style for like five minutes. That's the first, oh, I got to play.

127
00:24:34,730 --> 00:25:06,339
All right. Where is it? Right there. Oh shit. Hold on. It's in here. Dude, don't do this to me

128
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:14,500
right now. There's money on the line right now. Okay. This is connected to here. That's already

129
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:21,819
going up there, which I think that just, hold on. Wait, hold on. That's going to give me that.

130
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:37,140
And then, wait, oh fuck. How do I, that has to go there. Is there another barrel I don't have?

131
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:47,529
There must be another barrel or something. How do I open this? Unless I have to get in here first.

132
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:56,630
Hold on. Is there another barrel? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, look, look, look, look, look.

133
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,059
No, there's another, where's there another barrel? Do I need another barrel? I'm so close,

134
00:26:16,059 --> 00:27:12,339
but where's the, what do I got time? Get over here. Come on. Come on. I'm so close. Stop. What

135
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:20,650
do I got? 20 seconds, Twi. I got 20 seconds. 20 seconds. Oh, everybody eat shit. I just did it.

136
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:41,210
And time with like five, 10 seconds to spare. You had like three seconds left. It was frame perfect.

137
00:27:52,150 --> 00:28:00,950
I mean, I'm, wait, is it, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second.

138
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:07,460
Do we need to review it? We need to review the VOD. Apparently it was like one frame

139
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:16,039
is potential away from, it's one frame. It was, it may have been off by a frame. No. What? No,

140
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:26,680
it's not. Hold on. Let me get the VOD. Really? No way. So it's 10 minutes exactly. Right? Hold on.

141
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:39,349
I'll get it. Everybody hold for a second. Hold on. I gotta go. Is the VOD might not have it yet.

142
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:52,630
Sometimes it takes a few minutes. Okay. Recent broadcast. All right. Okay. Hold on. Let me get

143
00:28:52,630 --> 00:29:12,779
this on stream. This is weird. I'm like putting the VOD in here. Okay. Okay. All right. I got

144
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:20,890
the VOD here. The question is now, so where was it? It was, it's where I say three, two, one, go.

145
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:37,670
All right. I got to plug my headphones into another, cause they're plugged into the, it's over.

146
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:48,259
It was 1001. It was 10, zero, zero, zero, one. What? Hold on. I, this is crazy. I need to plug

147
00:29:48,259 --> 00:30:13,849
this in one sec. All right. What's the time here? Why am I not talking? Is there audio on this stream?

148
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:25,319
Where's the audio? There's no audio. I don't, why am I not talking? I don't know if I can do this.

149
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:40,470
The only thing I said. What the fuck? Okay. Um, looking at, we may, looking at, we may, two, one,

150
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:57,500
go. Okay. It's 1726. Forgot I had this power vote for me. Oh God. And by the way, it's Batman's

151
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:09,460
world kingdom heart style for like five. The VOD isn't even caught up yet. The VOD isn't even caught

152
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:27,029
up yet guys. We need to wait. Uh, we have to wait just a minute. Refresh it. Hold on. All right.

153
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:48,180
Refreshed. Okay. Let's go back to where it was there. Okay. So we got it. So what was it? 26,

154
00:31:48,180 --> 00:32:08,980
right? So it's 1726. Two, one, go. Yep. It's 1726. Fuck. How do I? Oh, everybody. I just did it.

155
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:21,180
Three, 24, 25, 26. Wait, no, I don't know. I think that counts. I just did it. I guys, that counts.

156
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:55,529
1726. How do I do playback speed? I jumped. I jumped guys. I've my buttons. Do you understand

157
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:01,430
that? I'm telling you right now. I think I count that because one very important thing

158
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:09,509
I hit jump instead of accept because remember it all video games are swapped, right? It's like,

159
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:15,829
oh, B is A on Xbox and A is B and X is Y and that's, I don't know. Do we count that?

160
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:43,339
It really is like one frame. I don't know. It's, it's like, it's like a frame or two late.

161
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:47,900
Fuck you. You've stopped playing and talked about space jam for two minutes.

162
00:33:47,900 --> 00:34:00,980
Um, does it count? I don't know. I've never had to deliberate this long on something like this.

163
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:07,220
What, what about walking through the door? Honestly, I think walking, I think walking

164
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,809
through the door is the solution. That's what I would say. Like I've walked through the book.

165
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:24,860
It's over. I win, right? It wasn't in 10 minutes. I don't have frames for this though.

166
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:48,139
Oh, shut up. You're annoying. Okay. I'm going to do space. I think I'm saying it. Do you hear that?

167
00:34:48,139 --> 00:35:01,820
It's like, like I say time right when it's in 26 still. You know what? I don't know. I don't

168
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:12,809
know what to do. I think it, but what if it's wrong? What the fuck? If I just shut up about

169
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:30,070
space jam. I didn't do it. I did. I don't think I did it. I don't think I did it.

170
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,210
Because you know what, in mod chat, we're talking about this. People, uh, in mod chat, it's being

171
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:46,440
brought to my attention that in previous times it was when I accepted the reward. It looks like I

172
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:55,449
accepted the reward a 10th of a second too late because I jumped and it was one full second later

173
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:04,300
I accept the reward. I'm sorry everybody, but we, we have, we got, I'm sorry everybody. That's the

174
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:11,179
way it works. You shouldn't be mad at the frame perfect loss. You should be mad at me talking

175
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:19,960
about space jam for five minutes. Yeah, that we gotta, we gotta, that we gotta go by the truth

176
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:36,469
and that was the truth. I know. I'm so sorry. That's the truth. We gotta go by the truth.

177
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:56,019
All right. Okay, let's go. Bugs of Bunny can fuck off. Bugs of Bunny can fuck off. What? What's

178
00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:05,849
going on? What? What's going on? What? What's still open? My stream is not open.

179
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:13,289
My stream is not open. My stream is not open. I'm telling you right now. My stream is not open.

180
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:20,090
Oh, okay. The banner is playing the stream. If you just go to German 985, the banner plays it.

181
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:30,980
No, it doesn't. What the fuck is going on? Yeah. The banner is playing the stream. All right. Let's

182
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:46,949
get back to it. Sorry, everybody. Okay. Sorry. Oh, sorry. I gotta plug this back in.

183
00:37:49,019 --> 00:38:03,539
Taze on day. That's a classic. All right. That was cool. I got the floor. What's up? Oh, I was just

184
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:12,809
so focused just now. Do you have business with me? I don't know. What are you doing? But no,

185
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:17,610
I'm not a spy. I'm a merchant. I may not look like it, but I'm actually the leader of a caravan.

186
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,510
I've traveled all the way here, but this town doesn't allow men to go in. So that's why I had

187
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:28,280
to, um, be spying. It's research. It's research. And think what you want. But I finally found some

188
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:35,980
key info on how to sneak into Gerudo town. Oh, in key info. Let me share with you my heroic tale.

189
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,440
It's been close to a week now. The guards have kicked me out more times than I can count.

190
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,400
I almost gave up hope. However, I have learned only recently of a man that slipped into this

191
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,500
well guarded town or that men is frequently traveling between Kara Kara Bazaar and Gerudo

192
00:38:51,500 --> 00:39:04,730
town and waiting here trying to spot him as he traveled. This is bright. I'm surprised he can

193
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:28,440
read. They're from the town. It said in between the town. Okay. So this is the road. Good travel on

194
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:56,699
the road. No fun allowed. There is no fun allowed. Not today. Why do I not have a horse? I have not

195
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:09,880
had a horse the entire playthrough. I have to walk this whole way. This got to be a state.

196
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:24,389
Frank 2 is right here. You're not too far away. What? Oh, it's too hot for the horse. Oh, shit.

197
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:39,719
Okay. By the way, why am I not on the road? There is no road. Use your shield. All right. How do I

198
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:52,710
do that? It's like a weird button combination, right? Remember what's wrong, babe? You've barely

199
00:40:52,710 --> 00:41:16,119
touched your gruel. No, I'm not. I'm not feeling it today. L plus A. There it is. Okay. Holy shit.

200
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:43,699
That was cool. Okay. I don't see anybody. Do you? My boss, I get the feeling that he isn't coming

201
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:51,659
back from Gerudo town anytime soon. Hope he's okay. Man snuck in. What? There's a man who got

202
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:57,340
into Gerudo town? And the boss says he comes here to the Kara Kara Bazaar? I guess it must be true

203
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:03,260
if the boss said so. Never seen anyone around who respects me as a super sneaky guy. There was that

204
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,619
pretty Hylian gal at the general store. It's unusual to see a Hylian girl dress like a Gerudo.

205
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:13,190
Her Gerudo clothes. I wonder where she bought them. Maybe if I wore those clothes. Ah, nah. I'm

206
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:23,530
so out of my element with all this sneaky stuff. Okay. What's our use for a weapon? What's the

207
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:36,250
shittiest thing that I have? Probably this. This thing sucks, right? Oh, that thing kind of sucks,

208
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:52,789
doesn't it? What's the matter? You got this look on your face that almost screams I gotta talk to

209
00:42:52,789 --> 00:43:18,090
you right now. Buy my stuff. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Somebody knows

210
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:29,539
what that is. Okay. I have a lot of junk, but I don't want to sell anything right now. Okay.

211
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:46,760
Uh, hi. Who are you? Uh, you, you're a voe, aren't you? Gotta go. I am. Why? Hmm. No, I bet mama

212
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:55,139
would have a problem with a delicate voe like you. Oh yes, I'm Ronson. I hail from Gerudo town.

213
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,900
The search for the love of my life is so exhausted by it. I'm exhausted by it.

214
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,829
Search. Uh, I don't know why I'm even saying this. It's no business of a Hylian like you, but

215
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,190
I'm constantly being bothered by my mother over not having found the love of my life.

216
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:16,090
Why the rush? You don't know? Really? It's incredibly rare for a male to be born

217
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:21,030
to the Gerudo. For our own survival as a people, we travel to find husbands. I've

218
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:26,230
proven myself to be a gifted tailor, but none of the voe I've met seem to appreciate a well hemmed

219
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:31,300
garment. I was hoping my craft would help me find a mate, but it doesn't seem like there's much work

220
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:37,349
for a tailor around here. I wonder if there's really, if there really is someone out there for

221
00:44:37,670 --> 00:45:05,480
me. What's this person doing? A treasure hidden inside a sandstorm by an ancient civilization.

222
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,329
Sounds like an adventure just waiting to happen. They say the sandstorm lets up for a few hours

223
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:16,980
each day, but I haven't seen it settle down for even an instant. Shifty merchants. Sorry,

224
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:29,769
no idea what you're talking about. The only things- did you fart? No. The only things I'm

225
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:33,929
interested in right now are this sandstorm and the treasure hiding inside its storming sands.

226
00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:45,670
Okay, well, who are you? Okay, so there's a treasure over there? Okay. Who do I need to talk to?

227
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:57,349
Any suspicious vendors. From my point of view, pretty much any merchant that is in Gerudo looks

228
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:09,719
suspicious, you realize. Still, no, it's my chair squeaking. The general store. Okay, where's the

229
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:26,650
general store? I thought that was a lion. Isn't this the general store right here? Oh, maybe this

230
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:42,409
is the general store. What do you got? That divine beast, it feels like it gets a little bit closer

231
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:47,860
every day. I wonder how long it'll be before I can get back to Gerudo town. Gerudo town.

232
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,869
There's a town to the southwest made up almost entirely of Gerudo. It's the largest settlement

233
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:58,440
in these parts. It's got a lively market and a canteen. The town's active from morning to night.

234
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,119
But well, they have a rule that'll affect you guys aren't allowed in. No vo may enter, they say.

235
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:19,349
Okay, I know. I'll take care of it. I got the divine beast, I got it. The sound of the divine

236
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:32,619
beast walking might be loud, but the beds are still comfy. Do you want to stay? No. What does this

237
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:42,920
even go to? I can't just take that? All right, so there's somebody in here I need to talk to?

238
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:53,579
Is it you? Oh, have you seen a sneaky guy? Sneaky what? You mean a vo sneaking around town. I

239
00:47:53,579 --> 00:48:02,230
haven't seen anyone like that. There's a Hylian Vi who likes to relax on the roof, though in the

240
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:28,650
afternoon it's probably too hot up there. Do I have to sleep or something? Climb, climb,

241
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:47,510
stop doing that. Somebody's sleeping up here. Please don't turn face cam on. No, I'm not going

242
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:57,110
to. All right, hi. Oh my, what a lovely young lad you are. Do you need something from me?

243
00:48:58,179 --> 00:49:02,420
Um, yes. What's that? You've heard about a man who snuck into Gerudo town. Oh, I don't

244
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:09,219
know anything. I don't know anything about him. Sorry, I couldn't be more help. Um, either one of

245
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:16,949
these? Gwent? You're making my cheeks warm looking at me like that. Um, which one of these do I do?

246
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:23,510
This one? I'm sure you agree that these clothes only help my looks, right? Now that I think about

247
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,909
it, the style would look quite fetching on you. I'd have to charge you of course, but I bet people

248
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:31,190
would see you completely differently if you wore them. What do you think? Do you want to buy them

249
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:55,000
for 600 rupees? Fuck out of here. Are you kidding me? Oh my fucking shins. All right, I need to sell

250
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:13,619
something. What do I have that's worth anything? All right, scream. Scream if I'm going to delete

251
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:19,099
something that's valuable because I forget this. There's certain things I can get rid of, like the

252
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:27,559
amber pieces or something, right? Are these valuable? What's the thing I can sell? It's been

253
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:41,539
three months. Sell the parts. I have a lot of these, you're right. It's not worth that much,

254
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:53,059
though. Sell the gems. Sell the gems. Sell the gems. Um, like this? Is this okay? How many do I need?

255
00:50:53,059 --> 00:51:12,119
I have 225. Is that okay? That's okay, right? Just don't sell the luminous ore. Okay, this is more

256
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:35,340
than that. I hope I'm not doing something wrong. All right, let's go. Haha, softlocked April fools.

257
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:49,699
I keep holding X to go faster, but that's not how you do it. You have to jump. It's okay,

258
00:51:49,699 --> 00:51:59,340
you'll find more. Yeah, I'll be all right. Gems don't have any purpose but just to sell. Okay.

259
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:21,050
All right, let's do it. All right, I already did this, right? Six. Is this a- I'm not going

260
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:51,849
to get scammed or something, am I? That's a lot of money. E. You look adorable. Ah, hee hee hee.

261
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:56,809
Just as I thought, you bake for quite a good looking gal. That's a traditional Gerudo outfit.

262
00:52:56,809 --> 00:53:00,329
It's such a striking look around here. I doubt anyone would even suspect that you're a man.

263
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:03,849
On top of that, it breathes so well that it's sure to help you deal with the desert heat,

264
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:09,639
at least a little. So glad I was able to help you out. If you're free to grab something to

265
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:26,300
eat sometime, keep me in mind. What was that? What was that? Oh, if you want to get more ladies

266
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:34,489
clothing, come back any time. Okay, all right, let's go. Does this have any- does this have,

267
00:53:34,489 --> 00:53:46,409
like, armor? Protects from the harsh sun. Wait, does this give me heat resistant?

268
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:52,900
Ooh, all right, cool. Let's go. Now I can just get in. I can just walk in, right?

269
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:10,010
Don't jump in the lava. I can teleport? Oh, that's right. I forgot. I forgot that was a

270
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:31,530
feature of this video game. Drip acquired. Bro forgot about fast travel. When you're going to

271
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:39,539
do a blink cosplay. Why can't you just cheat millions of rupees in? Because that's cheating.

272
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:59,590
All right, so can I just go in? What's going on over there? All right, I'm going in.

273
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:14,340
I can just walk in? Hi. Okay. Vore strictly forbidden. Take your time. Okay. If you stop

274
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,019
by the canteen, do yourself a favor and order a noble pursuit. It's hands down the best ring

275
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:39,769
I've ever had. This is a bright ass place. This area is 95% bloom. Okay. I already have all this,

276
00:55:39,769 --> 00:56:01,030
don't I? It's your brightness? I don't think it's my brightness. I don't have any money to buy

277
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:18,710
anything. Take- you can take the outfit off now? No, I can't. Yes, you can. I said I couldn't- I

278
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:29,800
have to- hold on. There's the Gerudo chief. Yet another traveler. What did you get in here?

279
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:45,619
Seems you have something rather interesting there. I didn't know they spoke in this game.

280
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:55,579
Some of them do. Declare your business but come no closer. Hold on, Ulyara. This one appears to be

281
00:56:55,579 --> 00:57:03,860
more than a common traveler. You there, what is your name? Link. And what is it you've come all

282
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:14,940
the way here to tell me? I only got one option. I can calm Naboris. You think you have what it takes

283
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:19,980
to subdue something so powerful as a divine beast. The only ones who could ever control them

284
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:26,230
were champions like Lady Urbosa. And all of the champions died in the Calamity a hundred years

285
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:34,389
ago. Hmm. Ulyara, a memory just jumped into my head. Something my mother spoke of. When the

286
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:39,909
Calamity happened, the princes of Hyrule placed a fallen swordsman into a deep sleep. That swordsman,

287
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:43,989
much like our new friend here, was named Link. That would always seem more legend than fact.

288
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:49,820
But Lady Riju, do those same stories not also say that a Hylian champion carried a legendary

289
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:55,480
sword? I see no such weapon in this person's care. They do indeed, if I recall correctly.

290
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:01,030
It was called the sword that seals the darkness. A princess of Hyrule supposedly hid it away

291
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:13,239
at every target in America. And every Walmart in America. What if the device on this one's hip?

292
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:20,579
It appears to be a precious relic of the Sheikah. I can't imagine they would give something so

293
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:26,460
valuable to a simple drifter, can you? I don't remember ever hearing of a Hylian Vi among the

294
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:33,909
champions. Wait a minute. You're a Vo. A Vo within our walls is a great crime, but a Vo who is a

295
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:39,349
champion? Well, we'd never mistreat a friend of Lady Urbosa. If you're here to help us with

296
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:47,400
Naboris, then we are allies. You saw it on your way to our town. Divine Beast Va Naboris cloaked in

297
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,900
a massive sandstorm hurling lightning at any who dare approach. We have to do something to stop it,

298
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,780
but we have yet to find any way to appease the Divine Beast on our own.

299
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:03,420
If you truly are a champion, perhaps you will be able to enter Naboris and calm its anger.

300
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:19,099
Lady Riju. Am I saying that right? Is it Riju? Riju? Am I saying it wrong? Is it Riju? Riju.

301
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:28,360
Riju. Okay. Perhaps if this person were first to prove his worth by recovering your stolen

302
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:34,710
thunder helm. Ah yes, an interesting suggestion. You see, there is only one thing in all the

303
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:41,260
Hyrule that can withstand the lightning from Naboris. Thunder Helm, a family heirloom and

304
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:47,179
relic of Gerudo. But as Buliaras says, it was stolen from us. You didn't worry Lady Riju,

305
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:51,849
if he truly is a champion, this should be an easy task for him. As long as he's not streaming on

306
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:57,369
Twitch. He's not a streamer. It'll take less than probably 30 minutes, but if he is a streamer,

307
00:59:57,369 --> 01:00:02,820
then we're fucked for at least like six hours. You can't even minus two. Don't worry. I got it

308
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:07,500
covered. Our soldiers can tell you all you need to know about the thieves that stole Lady Riju's

309
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:13,909
heirloom. Head through this arch. It will lead you to the barracks. Then seek out Captain Teek

310
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:21,000
and ask for full report. Without my heirloom, you'll never be able to approach Naboris. Okay.

311
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:47,619
So I have to get that. Okay. Where are the gems? Hello. What are you doing in here? This is the

312
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:52,650
barracks for the chief's guards. Not a place for tourists to gather. We're on high alert after the

313
01:00:52,650 --> 01:01:03,050
recent theft. So you should clear out. Turn down the brightness. I don't... Did I fuck it up?

314
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:09,079
Hold on a second. My apologies. I'm the officer in charge of the soldiers, Captain Teek. The

315
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:14,119
chief's heirloom was stolen by thieves belonging to the Yiga clan the other day. So everyone is on

316
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:21,019
edge. We've determined that the Yiga's hideout is in Carusa Valley. The soldiers are all exhausted.

317
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:30,099
So I was just thinking about requesting some extra help. Listen up. This Hylian Vi has agreed to help

318
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:36,010
us. So offer her any information you can. Consider her a part of our unit. If you have any questions,

319
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:54,260
my troops would be happy to help. Is it bright? I don't think I can even do that. Turn up the

320
01:01:54,260 --> 01:02:05,829
brightness. Wait hold on. There's not like gamma on this or something that I have turned up. No

321
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:18,619
there's not. I think that's just how it is guys. Gotcha April Fools. Getting real fucking sick of

322
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:49,619
putting this up. Okay let's go. I don't have any money but okay. So this is the Divine Beast. So I

323
01:02:49,619 --> 01:03:11,590
need to get... Where's the helm? They said what? Some town or valley or something? Over here. Okay.

324
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:41,579
So I gotta go over here. Check your quests. Ah okay. I think I just have to go up there.

325
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:57,909
Let's go that way. Oh you're a Hylian Vi. We don't see too many of you. I can't tell how old you are

326
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:01,940
but you look a little young to be coming to my shop. We make special drinks here. Drinks that

327
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:12,699
are definitely just for adults. How old is Link? Our featured cocktail is called Noble Pursuit. Many

328
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:18,599
of our customers come here specifically to order it. A light sweet taste. The cool sensation from

329
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:41,690
Meatship. It's like drinking distilled motivation. Okay so I can't I can't drink it. Link is 17.

330
01:04:41,690 --> 01:05:25,940
Okay he's 117. What? He slept for 100 years. Oh huh? He was very tired. It was at the start of the

331
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:34,969
game. That was four months ago. I don't remember that. I feel like I've been asleep for 100 years.

332
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:42,309
Okay so I think I'm just gonna go up here but I don't have like a place to go.

333
01:05:44,309 --> 01:06:01,130
Was it actually in the quest log? I don't see it anywhere. Oh I have to talk to everybody okay.

334
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:15,239
The yellow circle on the map. Yeah that's really far up. What are you doing in here?

335
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,679
I'm an archaeologist of sorts. I was just poring over some ancient text that I discovered the other

336
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:26,679
day and I finally decoded it. Well part of it at least but the rest it's not far off.

337
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:30,619
With this discovery I'll finally be able to make a name for myself as an archaeologist.

338
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:38,090
Of course you and I meeting here is no coincidence. I've never been one to question fate.

339
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:42,409
I can't explain why but I trust you for some reason. I'll tell you the details of my research.

340
01:06:42,409 --> 01:06:46,679
Let's hear it. There's a temple east of here near the entrance to the

341
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:53,989
Gerudo desert. It's dedicated to the seven giant statues of the heroines said to be the divine

342
01:06:53,989 --> 01:06:59,670
protectors of Gerudo. It's at this temple that I originally discovered the ancient script or reads

343
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:03,940
when the symbols of the seven find their place the blessed path will be revealed. That's all I've

344
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:09,460
been able to get. You know I'm going way too fast. It's believed that people once came from around

345
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:15,579
the world in search of the heroine's blessing but as far as I can tell it doesn't appear that anyone

346
01:07:15,579 --> 01:07:23,369
has found it yet. I'm not sure what exactly it means but maybe I'll find out once I've deciphered

347
01:07:23,369 --> 01:07:30,389
more of the text. I'm not sure if this is related but it said that heroines held powers that were

348
01:07:30,389 --> 01:07:37,099
part of a bigger whole. Each heroine had a different power, skill, spirit, endurance, knowledge,

349
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:46,980
flight, motion, and gentleness. Interesting. But they all look the same to me. I should understand

350
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:54,010
the entire script before long but that's only the beginning of my problems. That divine beast has

351
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:58,280
been moving around the area making it harder for me to conduct my research. There's no respect for

352
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:10,099
academia. What would my because what there's the seven deadly sins and then this is seven deadly

353
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:17,159
virtues whatever it is right. There's an opposite. What are the virtues? A lot of people don't know

354
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:22,680
that there are seven virtues and there are seven sins. Everyone's like oh you know envy, lust,

355
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:30,250
pride, greed. Nobody ever talks about the virtues. The seven heavenly virtues. It's charity,

356
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:45,289
um charity, humility, what are they? Humility, charity, humility, charity, chastity, gratitude,

357
01:08:45,289 --> 01:09:04,710
temperance, patience, and diligence. Those are the seven virtues versus the seven sins. Yeah all we

358
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:10,229
ever hear about is like oh greed and envy. I want to hear more about fucking temperance. What's

359
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:38,359
temperance's deal? Okay so let's talk. Go play Binding of Isaac then. Okay you are you serious?

360
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:43,779
Why did you let her go by herself? I apologize she said she just wanted to check it out.

361
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:50,090
Oh as if we aren't busy enough searching for the chief's heirloom. Now we have to find

362
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:55,210
Barta too. If the captain hears about this fiasco she'll punish us for sure. Probably a hundred laps

363
01:09:55,210 --> 01:10:08,039
around Jevudo desert again. Catholic Andy. I did I'm just saying we have everyone always does a

364
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:12,279
bunch of shit about the seven deadly sins but we never hear about fucking chastity. We never hear

365
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:27,510
about um harmony or whatever the other one is. We never hear about charity well charity yeah.

366
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:31,510
It's chastity. What is hold on a second why is everybody freaking out about this?

367
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:45,560
The state or practice of refraining from extramarital or especially from all sexual intercourse.

368
01:10:50,149 --> 01:11:18,250
Chastity is no sex. The virtues most virtuous of all streamers.

369
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:26,619
Yeah what am I talking about? I'm sitting here going like you know we keep hearing about greed

370
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:31,579
and lust. I want to hear more about no sexual intercourse. I want to hear about no sex, no

371
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:38,220
alcohol, no drugs. I also want to hear about um being polite to I want to be where's politeness.

372
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:54,699
What are the other ones? Hold on I need to break this down. The seven virtues.

373
01:11:58,199 --> 01:12:05,699
Humility okay humility. I think everybody could do with a little bit of humility right. What's

374
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:11,289
wrong with that? Charity. What's wrong with that? Gratitude. I think people you know being

375
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:21,399
gratitude being thankful and patience. That's a really big one. Patience is a huge one.

376
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:26,859
Diligence. That's a big one. Temperance. Let me look this up before this temperance doesn't

377
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:36,180
mean like sex or anything right? Temperance is the moderation in action thought or feeling

378
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:45,939
restraint. Moderation in the indulgence or passions. I would be temperance. We got fucking

379
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:59,979
oh we we got we got the most virtuous of all the virtues. Temperance. All things in moderation.

380
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:30,649
Temperance Andy. The only thing I knew about temperance was it spawned the blood donation

381
01:13:30,649 --> 01:13:45,289
machine in Isaac. That's it. That's the only thing I knew. All right these guys are fucking

382
01:13:45,289 --> 01:14:04,199
horrible. These guys are got a lot of health. This thing breaks. Okay oh yeah it's jump over

383
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:10,600
or jump to the side right. I'm gonna jump over it and do the big flurry. It didn't count.

384
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:33,430
Oh dude don't even. What the fuck? What do you even have any food? Kind of stealth boost.

385
01:14:37,109 --> 01:14:53,619
Oh I'll eat this. Oh my god I hate this enemy. They just do a gigantic aoe that you can't get

386
01:14:53,619 --> 01:15:09,689
away from. Everyone's so much faster than me. I'm just running. You won. I'm I lost. I'm

387
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:16,739
are you kidding me? What is going on with these enemies? Why are they like tuned up times a

388
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:36,539
hundred fucking million? What? I'm not even going that way. You have no armor on? Oh shit I had

389
01:15:36,539 --> 01:15:58,090
armor on last time and still do the same thing. I'm reading mod chat. I did know what that is.

390
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:18,970
I've heard that before. I just I thought it meant something else too. What the fuck does you think

391
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:43,850
it meant? I I don't know. There's no way I'm gonna climb that. What's going on over here?

392
01:16:43,930 --> 01:17:02,340
No temperance? Yeah I'm showing a lot of temperance right now by not fucking banning

393
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:19,020
like 4 000 of you from the chat. Can I launch this? That's patience not temperance. Oh well

394
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:38,779
temperance is restraint. Restraint, moderation. It's gonna go the correct way. This dude is a

395
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:59,829
heretic. You have to balance the virtues with the sins. There was one time that Holly and I

396
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:07,130
were eating and watching tv and we were watching a video of somebody eating a bunch of food. It was

397
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:12,739
one of those like oh look eat videos. I forget which one it was what we were even fucking watching

398
01:18:12,739 --> 01:18:22,630
but we were eating a pie together. Yeah a mukbang. Yeah we were eating a pie and it was a banana

399
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:26,729
cream pie. We were just eating out of the tin together and I remember I was pointing at the

400
01:18:26,729 --> 01:18:34,310
screen going this is this is sin. This is sin right here and we're eating a fucking pie out

401
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:43,420
of the tin together. It was like what what am I talking about? I was going this is sin. This is

402
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:49,819
sin right here and I had a mouthful of whipped cream and banana cream and I was shoveling it

403
01:18:49,819 --> 01:18:54,949
into my mouth on the fucking couch and she started laughing her ass off. I'm just like what what?

404
01:18:54,949 --> 01:19:03,500
She's like do you this is sin looking into a mirror. No you don't understand this is sin.

405
01:19:05,369 --> 01:19:11,529
This is delicious banana cream pie by the way honey. Oh yeah I'll take a lot of spoonful full

406
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:35,590
of it. It was just such it was such a hypocrite. Why did that scare the shit out of me?

407
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:44,300
Is he a ghost? What's wrong with Link? He's just like oh he's a ghost. Can I make it up here?

408
01:20:03,659 --> 01:20:09,420
No I didn't start saying okay no no no no no I think people have uh or let me let me give some

409
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:18,659
more context. I didn't start by chanting that. We had watched like five of them in a row sitting

410
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:24,659
there eating this pie and at at some point during this pie eating watching mukbangs is when I just

411
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:30,920
started pointing at the screen saying it. I don't know we were just watching. I think people just

412
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:36,489
don't people underestimate how much media I consume all the time. I watch a lot of shit. I

413
01:20:36,489 --> 01:20:48,819
watch tons of streamers and YouTube channels and TV shows. I just don't really talk about it. No yes

414
01:20:54,340 --> 01:21:15,289
where am I going? I could have just teleported over here. I thought you didn't watch much movie

415
01:21:15,289 --> 01:21:23,930
or TVs. Years ago that was the case. I want to say the last the last like six to twelve months

416
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:33,050
we've been watching a lot of media. I'm just hanging out on the couch. I am catching up with

417
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:41,350
almost a decade of TV I've not watched. So think about how awesome the position I'm in is. Think

418
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:46,069
of all the TV shows that have been huge. All the all the animes that you keep telling me to watch

419
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:52,229
that I've not seen a single episode of that is a queued up. I got Better Call Saul. I got I media

420
01:21:52,869 --> 01:22:00,409
this this I forgot I forgot to play the game. God damn it I hate when this happens. Oh my god

421
01:22:00,409 --> 01:22:19,369
what is going on right now? I think I'm screwed here. Let's teleport again. Good call. There's

422
01:22:19,369 --> 01:22:25,079
so much TV. There's so much movie. All the movies too. Oh you know what we saw um recently as well

423
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:41,260
we saw the new Puss in Boots. That was really cool. That was that was a really just nice movie.

424
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:48,760
It was a really nice movie. Okay I'm gonna go this way because that's I think this is the correct way

425
01:22:48,760 --> 01:23:00,420
to go to get up there. It was very good. So um I I don't want to speak completely out of my ass

426
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:06,710
because I don't know who was you know animation director on that movie but I really like this new

427
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:11,829
trend of animated movies especially with the action sequences dropping their frame rates down

428
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:21,479
a little. It's almost like that low frame rate feeling where oh this again Into the Spider-Verse

429
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:36,020
did that where each frame was almost deliberate. I really love that style a lot. It's kind of like

430
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:44,600
comic-y yeah. I don't like the high frame rate shit. I you know anti-technology Andy that's fine.

431
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:53,560
A 60 fps like a full like movie shot in like 48 fps and on those like plasma screen TVs

432
01:23:53,560 --> 01:24:02,600
where it's like 500 hertz it's just it's just it's a movie now. It's a movie now. It's not I can't

433
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:09,930
suspend my disbelief that much anymore. I remember watching I think it was one of the Lord of the

434
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:17,720
Rings in 48. I think maybe it was The Hobbit or something and it was at 48 144 hertz 240 hertz or

435
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:23,060
something. It was just I felt like somebody was videotaping it with a camcorder. They were actors

436
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:38,010
on the screen. It wasn't a movie anymore. Now you want to go? It's the self-opera effect. Exactly.

437
01:24:38,010 --> 01:25:08,260
Exactly. Stop. Oh my goodness. What did I just spawn? Look at all those gems. All right goodbye.

438
01:25:08,739 --> 01:25:22,890
Frame rate really only matters for games. I miss like 16 millimeter too. I know I'm an old person

439
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:28,039
but though a lot of movies that are filmed in 16 and 30 millimeter film

440
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:35,989
they act they feel different. They hit way differently. A lot of people here.

441
01:25:35,989 --> 01:26:00,460
Why even fight them? All right don't kill me please. These drop a lot of money. Holy shit.

442
01:26:02,789 --> 01:26:15,000
Okay what's this? Duplex bow. Fire two arrows at once.

443
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:28,409
How do I change my bow? Oh it has to be out first. Okay this thing's almost broken so I'm

444
01:26:28,409 --> 01:26:59,829
just gonna get rid of it. And now what? Torch? Is this some puzzle bullshit? This is some puzzle

445
01:26:59,829 --> 01:27:19,909
bullshit isn't it? I can't even carry anything. I have to get rid of this because it's gonna want

446
01:27:19,909 --> 01:27:26,539
me to walk around with the torch. I'm gonna light the torch here. Yep okay. What the hell do you

447
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:39,289
want me to do? Be more positive? Oh sure actually. So even if I don't know where I'm going I think

448
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:47,579
it's fine. I should be fine. It takes a little longer but that's okay. This door has fire on it.

449
01:27:47,579 --> 01:27:56,789
I'm imagining it has something to do with my flame in my hand. Oh I can go this way.

450
01:27:57,859 --> 01:28:10,899
That's where I came from. It's okay to check though. Maybe I burn the door? Really good. That

451
01:28:10,899 --> 01:28:19,460
was a good idea. I just had a really good idea. I'm not gonna hurt them. Nothing over here.

452
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:36,340
It's okay. It was worth a try. Fuck away from me. You little monsters. Let me try doing this.

453
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:52,710
Oh I can move these. Maybe I should burn them. Customer service. Oh that's another okay um you

454
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:57,750
know also I've seen a little bit of uh we've watched some of the old Jackie Chan movies.

455
01:28:59,189 --> 01:29:08,840
If have any of you ever seen Drunken Master? Holy shit those movies are fucking unbelievable.

456
01:29:12,489 --> 01:29:21,130
The old police story movies? Wow. If you've never seen police story, if you've never seen Drunken

457
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:31,529
Master 1 and 2 please please for the love of god within the next two or three days go watch them.

458
01:29:31,529 --> 01:29:38,010
The amount of of skill and the amount of of dedication that that they did in those movies

459
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:45,210
they were fucking unbelievable. It's required reading for the stream now. Gremlins 2 is on

460
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:57,260
there. Drunken Master 2 is on there too. Are you okay? Yeah I'm good. Are you? Which ones? Police

461
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:06,250
story and then Drunken Master. Jackie Chan it's gone. The old catalog of the old 80s and 90s

462
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:12,149
movies. Just go watch them all. I promise you won't be disappointed. They're just outrageous

463
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:18,380
with how talented and the martial arts are. They don't make them like that anymore and I will say

464
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:26,220
that. They don't make them like that anymore. They really don't. Go ahead. Say it. Go ahead.

465
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:37,100
They don't. Batches me. Go ahead. They don't make them like that anymore. John Wick? John Wick is

466
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:44,220
John Wick is good. John Wick is very good but I still don't think I still think the old Jackie

467
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:52,859
Chan movies are are better. I do. John Wick is awesome but I still think that those old Jackie

468
01:30:52,859 --> 01:31:02,149
Chan movies are are just they're the greatest of all time. They're yeah and it's like it's kind of

469
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:24,020
unfair to compare them anyways. What was even in this chest? I don't know. I'm just picking stuff.

470
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:35,399
I've been putting it down now. It was money okay. I actually bad chested during the one of the I

471
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:41,850
think it was the third um the third John Wick movie. I actually was bad chesting. I was like

472
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:51,819
what the fuck? Whoa. Oh yeah. During Drunken Master I couldn't even have an emotion. It was just my

473
01:31:51,819 --> 01:31:56,470
eyes were just glued to the screen. I didn't even have time to bad chest. It was like what the fuck.

474
01:31:56,470 --> 01:32:21,529
This is unbelievable. My jaw can't even go down. Oh you know what what a really big difference

475
01:32:21,529 --> 01:32:30,460
between John Wick and the old Jackie Chan movies are? Uh not very not a lot of firearms. The use

476
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:42,979
of like guns. It was mostly martial arts. Okay so what am I doing here? And some of the shit they

477
01:32:42,979 --> 01:32:57,239
pull off in John Wick with the firearms is crazy right? It's hard to compare them. I just break

478
01:32:57,239 --> 01:33:21,159
these? Take. Can I not push these out of the way? Vicious sickle. I have that's right. I have bombs.

479
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:59,939
Thought it's been too long. Okay what's going on here? Oh I didn't get this one. I need to draw.

480
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:23,210
I don't want to break it but I want to drop it. I hear some sparklies. Oh it's that. Yeah I've seen

481
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:42,699
Kung Fu Hustle. Kung Fu Hustle is awesome too. What made you want to hop on Zelda again? Immense

482
01:34:42,699 --> 01:35:05,300
peer pressure by 30 to 40 000 people. Wait what's going on? You mean to tell me I opened up every

483
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:18,859
single one of them and the last one I opened was the right one? I'm sitting here looking for a

484
01:35:18,859 --> 01:35:36,630
puzzle. All right let me eat some of these bananas. I need to. I didn't cook. I forgot to cook. Uh oh.

485
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:46,550
I hope there's nothing that dangerous in here. Oh shit someone's in there. What are you doing here?

486
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:51,989
This is the hideout of those Yiga thieves who stole the thunder helm. If they spot you they'll

487
01:35:51,989 --> 01:35:55,960
call their friends for sure. There's no way you can take them all on. Only you had some way of

488
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:01,109
distracting them but I don't know how. All I ever see them do is patrol and eat bananas. I haven't

489
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:09,020
seen anything else that you could exploit as a weakness. Poison the bananas. Poison the bananas.

490
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:39,989
I played enough Hitman. Okay. I don't know what weapon to use. They all seem too good. What do I

491
01:36:39,989 --> 01:36:48,069
use? I don't know what to do. Oh you have emote only ma. Oh no. But I don't want to break a good

492
01:36:48,069 --> 01:37:52,840
weapon. Whatever I'm gonna use this. No I'm not. I'm gonna use. I'm just gonna use the torch. It's

493
01:37:52,840 --> 01:38:14,460
not an instant kill. I just wanted the treasure. Just give me the chest. What's in it? Oh a sapphire.

494
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:32,979
Oh my god this banana is right there. I know what to do. I know what to do. I know what to do.

495
01:38:40,140 --> 01:39:05,670
All right so I have to shoot the bananas down. They probably go for the bananas. All right so

496
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:19,210
bananas are on this side over there. Look at the bananas. What are you doing? I'll take them if

497
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:51,800
you don't. Open them. What are you doing? Oh you're gonna eat the banana? Is it here? This sound?

498
01:39:51,800 --> 01:40:16,979
All right this sound. Dude what the? I'm doing this because fuck this place. Oh my god never mind.

499
01:40:17,060 --> 01:41:18,739
You see the banana? Get the fuck out of here. Get out of here. Oh fuck. Oh shit. Are you coming

500
01:41:18,739 --> 01:42:33,380
over here? Is there any more bananas? Oh my god. What the fuck is going on here? Forced stealth

501
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:47,880
missions. Drop every game of full letter grid. That's the rule. I didn't make it. I just follow

502
01:42:47,880 --> 01:43:10,279
the rule. So it's a good thing that uh Breath of the Wild started at 11. What just happened? Hey

503
01:43:10,279 --> 01:43:15,880
can you help me? I don't know what I did but there's like people fighting me. Open that up.

504
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:31,369
Let me in there. Okay so bananas. Will you just stop playing? Stop playing around and kill me

505
01:43:31,369 --> 01:43:49,560
already. Stop messing around and get get the job done. You're messing around. Thank you. So bananas.

506
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:56,920
I have a lot of them. Can I throw them? Can I just? Can I put them on the ground? Well that

507
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:26,279
does that work? Hold. It does work. Okay that fixes a lot of things. So this one should be,

508
01:44:26,279 --> 01:44:37,130
I just need to have patience. Come on I gotta do one of the virtues. Prove that I'm a virtuous

509
01:44:37,130 --> 01:45:03,050
streamer. Patience. Temperance. Shut up. That's lame. I'm telling you there's not, there's one

510
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:13,500
thing a gamer doesn't want to hear in a game. It's this. Nobody wants to hear that.

511
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:23,880
Oh nobody wants to hear that in any game. Where'd they go? Okay all right. Just I don't want to

512
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:55,880
waste the bananas. The bananas just dropped next to you. Bananas are next to you. How did you not

513
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:10,140
want to eat those? If I kill them does it just, can I just skip this whole section if everybody

514
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:22,630
here dies? Yeah? All right let's go. I'm taking out the fucking royal claymore for this one.

515
01:46:22,630 --> 01:47:17,560
No I'm not. I'll use this. I don't, what is, where am I? Okay cool. Just hold five of them.

516
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:26,899
I'm just gonna throw a handful of these on fucking ground. Look what I got. I came to the potluck.

517
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:42,819
Here look what I, look at this. Okay I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I could have killed him if I didn't

518
01:47:42,819 --> 01:48:10,619
have the fucking torch equipped. I'll do it for real this time. This part sucks. I'm glad

519
01:48:10,619 --> 01:48:14,060
my face cam isn't on. Actually let's turn it on for a second so you can see probably how red I am.

520
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:37,770
Oh my god. I hate this. So I just want to play the game. I hate like, oh sneak. Oh wait. Wait a

521
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:41,529
second. Wait hold on. Wait for them to walk around the corner. Oh I hate these in games.

522
01:49:42,600 --> 01:50:06,069
Shit. Oh that's the fastest way to die. Go get out of here. I'm never gonna be able to do this.

523
01:50:06,630 --> 01:50:13,590
This is gonna be worse than the forest. Bro I didn't even pick up the bananas. I'm so flustered

524
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:22,760
right now. Did I? I'm so flustered I didn't even realize that I did pick up the bananas and I got

525
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:26,659
mad because I didn't think I'd picked up the bananas but I already picked them up. That's next level

526
01:50:26,659 --> 01:51:16,039
tilted. All right just wait. Let's just sit here for 25 minutes while he walks around. Go get it.

527
01:51:16,039 --> 01:51:49,380
Okay back here again. How did that miss? I want to get that but I don't even care. Why does he not

528
01:51:49,380 --> 01:52:13,609
see it? The banana's right next to you. What's going on? Is this bugged? What's happening here?

529
01:52:13,609 --> 01:52:59,420
Are you gonna see it now? That was dumb. You didn't, this guy see me? What the fuck is happening in

530
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:34,170
this video game right now? I don't give a shit. I'm going. I'm gonna use the royal claymore. I'm

531
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:46,060
not fucking around anymore. Holy shit that's the absolute. I just, I got their whole stash. Oh my

532
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:53,479
goodness gracious. All right can you guys help me? Am I missing an item or something? Because

533
01:53:53,479 --> 01:54:36,220
like this seems impossible. No? My armor is loud. I'm gonna fucking take it off. I feel like I'm

534
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:45,300
making the same amount of sounds I wore earlier. I'm looking at the sound meter. The purple line

535
01:54:45,300 --> 01:55:19,369
that's still bad. The weapons too? I don't think that's doing anything. All right so what the hell

536
01:55:19,369 --> 01:55:32,300
happened here? This doesn't really sense. Here's your banana. Go get it. Why are you looking at me?

537
01:55:32,300 --> 01:56:18,600
Is anybody up here? Is somebody gonna see me up here? I hope not. I got your whole stash. Fuck all

538
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:43,539
of you. Yeah I'm gonna watch this. Okay where do I need to go? That's where I died. I gotta go

539
01:56:44,100 --> 01:57:05,800
across that way right? This is gonna be a really ballsy move. What are you fucking talking about?

540
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:19,260
Get up there. No! Why didn't I jump? Why didn't I go up? What? Are you fucking shitting me?

541
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:48,779
Why couldn't I climb over that? You gotta be fucking kidding me. Why couldn't I climb up the

542
01:57:48,779 --> 01:57:53,960
lip? It's not like it was any different than any other lip in this whole game so far. What is this

543
01:57:53,960 --> 01:58:49,510
shit area? Why did you make me come here? This sucks. The sounds and shit too. They can hear you.

544
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:54,520
They can see you. They can see you from across the whole fucking map. This motherfucker right here

545
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:59,479
sees me every time I shoot the banana down on the right side which is in my brain. It's hey

546
01:58:59,479 --> 01:59:24,619
go look there's a banana over there. He don't care. He doesn't care. Huh? What's this guy's deal?

547
01:59:24,619 --> 01:59:40,979
Why won't he go to the banana? It's right there dude. Go get that banana. No no no no do not put

548
01:59:40,979 --> 01:59:48,979
a bomb down. Whatever you do please don't put the bomb down. Oh fuck I have to put the bomb down.

549
01:59:48,979 --> 01:59:57,020
Shit. Wait. Wait. Can I magnetize the banana? There's radiation in those fucking things.

550
01:59:57,100 --> 02:00:06,420
I definitely can't. Oh my god there's another banana right there. He's gonna see this.

551
02:00:16,890 --> 02:00:29,479
Try this again. I'm looking at mod chat. One of the mods said this is the port of the game

552
02:00:29,479 --> 02:00:51,189
where I left and never came back. Baby rage. Baby rage. I'm glad there's no face cam on

553
02:00:51,189 --> 02:01:03,020
because that looked weird. I almost snapped my controller at this part. I had to take a break.

554
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:15,539
Oh no. I have an idea. Let's just be. I just got like a hundred bananas. Why would I not do this?

555
02:01:15,539 --> 02:02:04,789
Is anybody even over there? Shit. Oh dude this just there's no safe place to go. Please don't

556
02:02:04,789 --> 02:02:09,579
turn around. Please don't turn around. Please don't turn around. Okay I'm okay right here.

557
02:02:09,579 --> 02:02:18,859
Now I'm gonna throw a bunch of bananas over here. Sit down. You can't hold that here.

558
02:02:18,859 --> 02:02:29,750
What are you talking about dude? Which way is he gonna go? Which way is he gonna go?

559
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:38,810
Is he going this way? Is somebody over here? Why? It's okay. I'm all right. I'm gonna get to

560
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:58,579
the ladder. If he doesn't go for one of those bananas I'm gonna scream. I don't even. I don't.

561
02:02:58,579 --> 02:03:04,199
That could be a legendary item. The master sword could be in that chest. I don't care.

562
02:03:04,199 --> 02:03:45,109
I don't want it. I'm kind of concerned right now though. Okay please tell me I did it right.

563
02:03:45,109 --> 02:04:11,189
I'm going. I'm going. Oh no. Oh my god. Are they here? Nobody comes in here right?

564
02:04:11,189 --> 02:05:15,369
Just happened. Whoa. What the hell was that? Tapaz. What's a tapaz? Thank god. Like in Diablo

565
02:05:15,369 --> 02:05:40,789
2. Diablo. What's Diablo? Diablo? Who the heck are you and what are you doing in my napping spot?

566
02:05:40,789 --> 02:05:54,220
Wait a minute. A thing on your hip. Is that a sheikah slate? If that's a sheikah slate then that means

567
02:05:54,220 --> 02:06:03,210
that means it's you. You're that link guy I've been looking for. What luck. My scouts are out in the

568
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:11,930
field looking high and low but you just wander into my hideout. Oh excuse me. I haven't introduced

569
02:06:11,930 --> 02:06:30,039
myself yet. I'm the leader. I'm strong. I'm burly. The one. The only. Master Koga. Prepare yourself.

570
02:06:30,039 --> 02:07:03,619
Okay bye. I was gonna see you again. No. No. No. Better. Come on. I gotta get better than that.

571
02:07:03,619 --> 02:07:11,640
That's good. Oh look at all the crystals around him. No. No. Keep the old picture.

572
02:07:15,619 --> 02:07:32,779
Oh my fucking god damn it. Get me out of this. I'm sure I use this as a weapon.

573
02:07:34,090 --> 02:08:30,550
Freezing frost blade. I can't turn that into ice. What just happened? He dropped it on his head.

574
02:08:46,859 --> 02:09:01,020
Uh oh. Double. Where do they go? Just fly at you.

575
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:49,130
Hmm. Oh no. No. No. No. No. No. No. I know. I know. I know. I know. Close. Yeah.

576
02:09:53,720 --> 02:10:41,539
Same deal right? A little late. Phase three. It's a big one. When does he drop it?

577
02:10:41,539 --> 02:11:14,579
Okay so it's tethered to him. Ha ha ha ha. Hmm. Again? That's pretty easy. Just fun though.

578
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:21,670
You think I'm just gonna let this stand? Do you?

579
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:30,539
You? I almost lost my temper there. What a pain. I can't go out this way. What to do? What to do?

580
02:11:32,310 --> 02:11:39,130
He hates this game. Why didn't you just use the bow? What do you mean?

581
02:11:46,060 --> 02:12:07,960
I need my serious moves. This is the end. That was infuriating. You're gonna be alright.

582
02:12:09,369 --> 02:12:21,939
You'll be alright. You're gonna be fine. Pretty soon you'll be gone and not just from my light

583
02:12:21,939 --> 02:12:28,840
of sight. Only the leader of the Yiga clan can use this secret technique. It is the- Oh no.

584
02:12:32,859 --> 02:12:42,840
His own creation? Killing him in the end? All the hubris? All the arrogance? Who could have seen

585
02:12:42,840 --> 02:13:04,039
that coming? If only he had temperance and patience. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Yes. Yes. Yes.

586
02:13:04,039 --> 02:13:10,359
What's in it? Yes. I can't wait to open this. Yes. What's in here? God. Okay. Calm down. What's in

587
02:13:10,359 --> 02:13:37,159
here? Freshest Gerudo heirloom. Reclaimed from the Yiga. Hooray. Yeah. No, I didn't. Alright. Now we

588
02:13:37,159 --> 02:14:06,390
can go all the way back here. Right? We have to bring this back. Let's go save it. Yeah. Jeremy,

589
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:13,930
you can just stop playing. It's okay. What did I say? A full letter- I said it was an 11 so a full

590
02:14:13,930 --> 02:14:25,770
letter grade down would be a 10. I'm also saying that to all the Nintendo fans. Don't, uh, don't

591
02:14:25,770 --> 02:14:39,800
murder me. I'll bring this shit down a full letter grade. I just heard- I heard like the

592
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:58,630
pitchforks get grabbed. Like off the fucking castle wall. Okay. Do you think it's a B?

593
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:23,060
I think it's better than a B. I think this is definitely an A. I don't know what kind of A.

594
02:15:23,619 --> 02:15:51,539
It could be an A minus. It could be an A just regular A. Am I not allowed in here? It feels

595
02:15:51,539 --> 02:16:16,069
like a B game with you playing. Oh, okay. This is 100%. This is 100% at least a 90%. We'll see.

596
02:16:16,069 --> 02:16:56,459
Have the heirloom. I would give it an 80, but I'm not Mr. Streamer. No, this is a great game.

597
02:16:56,459 --> 02:17:15,750
Anytime I think a game is great, it go- it's a 90 at least. He hates it. No, I just hated that

598
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:25,450
section. I just hate stealth. Even in the game that's built around a stealth game, every time

599
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:35,909
I played Hitman, I sneak past the first guard and then just throw bricks, vases, and fucking

600
02:17:35,909 --> 02:17:41,340
briefcases at people. I just can't- I just don't like them. I hate stealth games. I do. You can say

601
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:53,239
he hates- I hate stealth games. I hate them. I do? Fine. You got it out of me. I don't like them.

602
02:17:53,239 --> 02:18:02,120
Fine. I don't like them. That's kind of good. Oh, I've been holding that in for like 10 years.

603
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:08,149
That feels good. What- I'm gonna get some more takes. How about- you know how I feel about this?

604
02:18:12,889 --> 02:18:18,860
Just go off on just- how about this take? I don't give takes. No. No, thank you.

605
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:33,819
Your arrival in the midst of all this must be the work of Lady Urbosa. Please give me the helm.

606
02:18:33,819 --> 02:18:54,950
Jerma, you only take you never give. You've got me fucked up today.

607
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:39,000
Boy, have the two of you been getting along all right?

608
02:19:41,479 --> 02:19:50,040
It's okay, I know. Your silence speaks volumes. She gets frustrated every time she looks up and

609
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:55,639
sees you carrying that sword on your back. It makes her feel like a failure when it comes to

610
02:19:55,639 --> 02:20:00,520
her own destiny. Don't worry, it's not like you carry blame in any of this. I didn't have

611
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:04,120
breakfast this morning. I can relax. Stomach's grumbling.

612
02:20:37,879 --> 02:20:41,479
You be sure to protect her with your life.

613
02:20:41,479 --> 02:20:45,079
The game's quiet, sorry. You guys are fucking crazy, I love it.

614
02:20:45,079 --> 02:20:49,000
The night brings a chill. It's probably time we take her in.

615
02:20:50,299 --> 02:20:52,540
Hmm. Or...

616
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:02,040
And I just turned it up! Oh my god!

617
02:21:06,459 --> 02:21:10,299
Hey dude, the game's quiet. Did you say that so I would turn it up during the fucking lightning

618
02:21:10,299 --> 02:21:34,340
part, dude? Oh my god, I'm so s- that scared the shit out of me. That was kind of weird.

619
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:46,500
I can't get this thing off.

620
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:58,340
I must find some way to stop that thing before it threatens my people. Of course I'll help.

621
02:22:05,610 --> 02:22:09,530
Hearing a simple, confident pledge of support from you would be what puts me at ease.

622
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:18,409
You guys having a good time? You guys- one in the chat, you having a good time?

623
02:22:18,409 --> 02:22:22,809
I'm seeing- I'm seeing way too many ones. I'm seeing way too many yeses.

624
02:22:22,809 --> 02:22:27,639
That's a lot of yeses. I'm not all right with that.

625
02:22:27,639 --> 02:22:42,420
You guys having a good time right now? I'm not into that.

626
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:46,260
I'm so fucked up right now, I don't know why. Something's in the water today.

627
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:55,510
I need to get the sand seal. The lookout post isn't too far from town,

628
02:22:56,149 --> 02:22:59,350
but you should take a sand seal there and get some practice in that way.

629
02:22:59,909 --> 02:23:16,250
Okay, get a sand seal. I like that water.

630
02:23:16,250 --> 02:23:24,459
Oh, another thing about Puss in Boots. Did anybody else feel this way? I know

631
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:31,610
Holly and I talked about it, but I- so much stuff in that movie just looked so delicious.

632
02:23:32,329 --> 02:23:36,540
This looks like a popsicle. Like a glowing popsicle.

633
02:23:45,989 --> 02:23:58,920
This dude's on another planet right now.

634
02:23:59,399 --> 02:24:07,620
I promise I didn't just do a bong rip, but it's pretty suspicious considering the next thing I

635
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:15,299
said. I wanted to eat a majority of the Puss in Boots movie. That's very- I understand that that

636
02:24:15,299 --> 02:24:32,950
sounded a little- a little suspicious. I need to cook. I need to- where can I cook?

637
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:42,540
I have a lot of ingredients. I'm not going to the divine beast until I cook. Where can I cook?

638
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:58,649
There's gotta be a stove around here somewhere, right? Why is it- there's gotta be a stove.

639
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:13,690
Every town has a stove. Is it near the stairs? Ow! That hurt a lot. I hope that wasn't too bad.

640
02:25:14,409 --> 02:25:43,000
I don't know. Where is it? Near the stairs, you said? I scratched my nose and I scraped

641
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:57,000
the microphone accidentally. Sorry about that. What? Phrasing. Very poor choice of words.

642
02:25:57,639 --> 02:26:43,100
What? This fucking bong fell over. I can't drink this, so. Can I cook here? You mean these stairs?

643
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:53,180
Left. I got it. Okay. What do I have for ingredients? And I kind of have- I forget how

644
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:57,620
this whole system works. Because you can make potions, but you can make food too. You don't

645
02:26:57,620 --> 02:27:09,190
want to combine both of them. So, I can do a mushroom. I can do banana. What if I cook a

646
02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:49,639
banana? Okay, there we go. What does cooking a banana do? Attack power boost? Okay, so that's

647
02:27:49,639 --> 02:28:22,950
what that does. So, attack power. So you can only do one buff, so don't combine buffs. That's gonna

648
02:28:22,950 --> 02:28:38,170
be pretty sick. There we go. Replenishes your stamina when cooked into a dish. So, this is a

649
02:28:38,170 --> 02:28:48,360
stamina replenish. This is attack power. Banana is also attack power. Just go all in. Sort your

650
02:28:48,360 --> 02:29:08,219
inventory. Any other attack power? I think this is all right. Yeah, I'll cook these. Maybe this

651
02:29:08,219 --> 02:29:33,219
will be a big one. Whoa. High level attack power boost for four minutes. Good. One truffle. Maybe

652
02:29:33,219 --> 02:30:04,420
a steak. Just one truffle. One truffle only. Ah, that's right. It's a full recovery. So,

653
02:30:04,420 --> 02:30:27,020
I'm just gonna make a few of these. What about truffle and salt? Do I have salt? It's gonna be

654
02:30:27,020 --> 02:31:32,059
a salty truffle. Why was that one worse? Too much salt. Okay, withstand cold. Probably four of these

655
02:31:32,059 --> 02:31:45,290
and then something else too. Something like this. Yeah, it's gonna be a lot. 10 minutes of low level

656
02:31:45,290 --> 02:32:17,510
cold. Not anymore. Electricity. Bitter cold. And then, how about a nutty seasoning? That's almost 11

657
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:42,250
minutes of mid-level cold. Okay. Electricity protection. Some salt. Another one of those.

658
02:32:42,250 --> 02:33:03,129
And seasoning. Why do you sound like a wow streamer? I don't know. Oh, that's a huge raid.

659
02:33:03,129 --> 02:33:15,180
Big raid. Massive raid. Welcome, everybody. That is a conner. That is a sea dog raid. Welcome,

660
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:25,579
everybody. Playing some Breath of the Wild. Thanks for the raid. Yeah, I turn the face cam on to say

661
02:33:25,579 --> 02:33:35,430
hello. Sometimes. They get face cam and not us. You got it. I did it like three times already.

662
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:41,420
Oh, the moderation settings. Right. You can't say the. You can't say is. You can't say smelly.

663
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:49,819
You can't say sucks. You can't say he sucks. There's a lot of weird shit today. Just to let

664
02:33:49,819 --> 02:33:54,600
you know. So be aware of that. There are some, there are a lot of things you just can't say today.

665
02:33:54,600 --> 02:34:06,680
The mods are just having a chuckle. There's a hair on that. But anyways, hi. Thanks, conner.

666
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:21,959
If you don't follow Sea Dog, please do it. He's a gentleman. Scholar. Wonderful, wonderful man. Go

667
02:34:21,959 --> 02:34:36,600
follow. You got nice hair. Hey, thanks. Temperance and chastity. We don't talk about that when new

668
02:34:36,600 --> 02:35:04,420
people show up. This is stamina. Stamina. Is there any more stamina stuff? Oh, that is electricity.

669
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:16,790
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't see it as food. Defense. More hearts. All right, we're doing stamina.

670
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:42,940
Give me double meat and two salts. Let's go. This is attack power and then just salt. Whatever. Why

671
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:55,290
not? Yeah, for all conner, for all your viewers, we were talking about how all the seven deadly

672
02:35:55,290 --> 02:36:04,680
sins get a ton of screen time, but the seven virtues do not. We went over it. Humility. Chastity.

673
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:24,120
Temperance. Patience. Diligence. What are the other two? Charity. Sin. Dude, they're all gone by now.

674
02:36:26,409 --> 02:36:54,739
No! Who banned that person for fucking 10 minutes? Mid-level electricity. Very good. I think I'm

675
02:36:54,739 --> 02:37:32,819
going to need those, so good. Kind of out of ingredients. What? I would love to hear your

676
02:37:32,819 --> 02:37:38,659
opinion on macaroni and cheese. This person's name is macaroni and cheese or something.

677
02:37:38,659 --> 02:37:55,670
Um, what do you mean? Do I like it? I mean, I love macaroni and cheese. It's great. All right,

678
02:37:55,670 --> 02:38:07,430
I'm good for now. My opinion's on macaroni and cheese. It depends on who's making it.

679
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:12,170
I've had some runny ass macaroni and cheese before. That was awful. I've had some really,

680
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:20,170
really good macaroni and cheese. That was creamy. Delicious. Do you want me to tell you what my,

681
02:38:20,250 --> 02:38:23,129
you want to know my absolute number one mac and cheese? Is that what it is?

682
02:38:31,850 --> 02:38:44,790
Um, okay. My favorite mac and cheese. You're not going to say Velveeta, are you? No.

683
02:38:45,430 --> 02:39:07,340
What's happening to me? Is it cold or? It's cold. Okay. Too cold? How cold is it? I'm still this

684
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:34,549
cold? Can I just make some shit? I could have eaten that stealth food. Um, these are all too

685
02:39:34,549 --> 02:39:51,370
valuable. This is too valuable. All right. Hold the fire sword. Holy shit, that actually works.

686
02:39:51,450 --> 02:40:00,920
I thought you were lying. Um, yeah, macaroni and cheese is great. I'm a big fan of a multiple

687
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:11,450
cheese macaroni and cheese. I'm, I don't know if I would put breadcrumbs on the top, although I

688
02:40:11,450 --> 02:40:23,000
have to be in the mood for it. I do not like mac and cheese that is runny. If it's runny,

689
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:31,270
get it away from me. The cheese needs to be sticking to the noodles. I don't want it running

690
02:40:31,270 --> 02:40:42,649
off. And they also, I don't want that much cheese. Some people load it up with, oh, gooey, gooey,

691
02:40:42,649 --> 02:40:47,739
cheesy, right? No, no, no. It's like too much. It's kind of gross. Don't overdo it with cheese.

692
02:40:47,739 --> 02:40:56,280
It's a little too much. I like it light. I don't want to have a heart attack after I take a bite.

693
02:40:56,280 --> 02:41:22,059
Oh damn. Golden bow. Is this yours? What do I get rid of? I don't know what to get rid of.

694
02:41:22,059 --> 02:41:40,360
One of the duplex bows. What cheeses though? Uh, cheddar, maybe Havarti. Swiss cheese can work

695
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:46,229
there. Pepper Jack works there. Honestly, you could just do whatever you want. Most cheeses

696
02:41:46,229 --> 02:42:15,100
go pretty well together, except no goat cheese. Disgusting. I'll put a lookup post. Okay. What

697
02:42:15,100 --> 02:42:24,659
about cottage cheese? Cottage cheese is fine. Ooh, that's really cool looking. Um, cottage cheese

698
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:33,340
with a little bit of cracked, just pepper all over it is pretty good. Gouda is really good.

699
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:43,430
I actually am not a big fan of brie. I don't like soft cheeses really. Cottage cheese and pepper.

700
02:42:43,430 --> 02:42:56,229
Try it one day, then come back and report. All right, we're doing another divine beast. Let's go.

701
02:42:56,229 --> 02:43:09,780
The sand seals to get in really close to that thing. I'll take the lead. I like feta, but feta

702
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:35,350
is not goat cheese. Shoot at its feet with bomb arrows. Not. It can be. I know the difference.

703
02:43:35,350 --> 02:43:56,260
Staying close to not get shocked. Retreat. Not. She said, wait, here's not many. You gave me 20.

704
02:43:56,260 --> 02:44:13,180
Feta is sheep. So I'm sorry, everybody. Feta is not goat. It is sheep. All right. Stop asking me

705
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:28,149
my opinions of cheeses. You're trying to derail the whole day. I need bomb arrows. I should

706
02:44:28,149 --> 02:44:55,959
probably put the other bow on. I built a computer one time like 10 years ago and it made that sound

707
02:44:55,959 --> 02:45:02,920
when I turned it on and I turned it off, unplugged it from the wall and cried. It's a true story.

708
02:45:10,420 --> 02:45:15,459
It was a little longer than 10. It was probably, I don't know how long ago, maybe 15,

709
02:45:15,459 --> 02:45:34,200
more than 15 years ago. I don't remember. Why would you cry? Because I don't know,

710
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:38,840
I like saved up a bunch of money and I'm going to build a computer and I put it all together

711
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:47,770
and it was just like, and it took like all day. It just was like overwhelming fucking sadness.

712
02:45:47,770 --> 02:45:57,819
I couldn't help it. I was just like, this sucks. I'm fucking so sad. Yeah. Who wouldn't cry for

713
02:45:57,819 --> 02:46:09,260
that? Are you kidding me? That's what a disaster of a day. I want to take out a different bow

714
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:40,899
because this shoots multiple arrows. What's going on? What's going on? Wait, there's a shrine. Why

715
02:46:40,899 --> 02:46:55,590
am I having so much trouble controlling this? It only shoots. Oh, okay. Is that what I want though?

716
02:46:56,149 --> 02:47:52,809
How do I put this down? Okay. You play games like a Midwestern mother. Okay. Let's go. That was

717
02:47:52,809 --> 02:48:06,459
really fast. Wow. That was really good. So good. Midwestern mother, huh? But why don't you just go

718
02:48:06,459 --> 02:48:15,540
upstairs and go to bed? Don't you know? I will not be hearing any more of that. I will not be hearing

719
02:48:15,540 --> 02:48:37,770
any more of that. Fortunately, no choice but to entrust the rest to you. It's Canadian. Oh boy.

720
02:48:37,770 --> 02:48:45,780
Yeah, you betcha. That's not Canadian. It's not, it's not Canadian. That's mid, it's Midwest.

721
02:48:45,780 --> 02:49:00,819
I'm having trouble because all I can hear is the audio. That's Minnesota, Wisconsin. That's

722
02:49:00,819 --> 02:49:13,940
Northern Midwest. It's still the Midwest. Minnesota. It's Northern Midwestern. I can't say

723
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:56,790
Northern Midwestern and say it's not Midwestern. Soda. What happened? Oh no, this looks tricky.

724
02:50:10,120 --> 02:50:36,940
Somebody said this is the hardest divine beast. Okay. I think I held on to this. I need more

725
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:46,979
weapons. So badly. I need more weapon slots. Get rid of this torch. Don't you have to destroy

726
02:50:46,979 --> 02:50:57,639
this stuff? Shoot the eye or something, right? Okay. So where are we going? This level is going

727
02:50:57,639 --> 02:51:36,600
to make me puke. Oh man. I don't like that. The background moving like that. Okay. Electricity

728
02:51:36,600 --> 02:52:19,000
field. Maybe. No, you guys have been good. Put it on. One. I need a map. What's with the horror

729
02:52:19,000 --> 02:53:00,549
music? It's like scary music. Ancient battle acts. I'll take it. What was that? This brightness is

730
02:53:00,549 --> 02:53:22,469
so bright. Well, they want me to have 50 of these for some reason. So I guess I'll hold on to it.

731
02:53:22,469 --> 02:54:13,979
Wait, can I shoot through here? I don't think so. Nope. Whoa. I climbed this. Go down there.

732
02:54:14,620 --> 02:54:43,260
Let's check the other side. I lost the weapon, but whatever. All right. What about here?

733
02:54:44,219 --> 02:55:16,250
Can you stop mashing the piano, please? Stop going like this on the piano where you just take all

734
02:55:16,250 --> 02:55:27,159
your fingers and just smoosh down. That gets you thrown out. That gets you thrown out, by the way.

735
02:55:27,159 --> 02:55:36,260
I don't care where you are. I don't know if you're in a house. If you do that, you're getting thrown

736
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:48,500
out. This is going to happen. Just don't do that. You could be having a very, very normal conversation

737
02:55:49,829 --> 02:55:55,110
hanging out. Oh, hey. Oh, you got a piano? Oh, cool. We open it up.

738
02:55:58,389 --> 02:56:04,200
Someone's coming in that room and going, get out. Get out. I don't, I don't want you here anymore.

739
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:27,290
Get out. No, it's time for you to go home. All right. The thing obviously spins, but how do I spin

740
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:50,180
it? I had to get up there, up there. Oh, I can go that way. No, I can't. I think I can make it from

741
02:56:50,180 --> 02:57:04,920
here. Let's try it. Okay. Dude, what the hell is going on here? I got to get over there.

742
02:57:05,639 --> 02:57:42,819
Oh, fuck. I went the wrong way. Did I? Oh, okay. Good to know. Ancient spring. I can't believe bald

743
02:57:42,819 --> 02:58:03,750
coin is still an emo. I never deleted it. I could have gone out that way, but whatever. No, no.

744
02:58:05,829 --> 02:58:39,579
The most that emo has been used in five years. Oh, now I get the map. Okay. Oh, I have to,

745
02:58:39,579 --> 02:58:49,719
I can rotate it. So the middle is a cylinder that spins. Good work getting the map of the divine.

746
02:58:49,719 --> 02:58:56,260
The terminals that control are noted by a series of glowing points on your map.

747
02:58:56,260 --> 02:59:02,299
Take no borders back by activating all of the terminal. You're ready for this. Who's talking

748
02:59:02,299 --> 02:59:36,950
to me? Okay. Rotate 90 degrees. Execute. Right. I can do this one. All right. Do I have to do all

749
02:59:36,950 --> 02:59:46,500
before this one? I can do this one now. Now this is the last one. Okay. So this one, um,

750
02:59:47,139 --> 03:00:14,629
eh, shit. Whoa. This actually, wait a minute. Okay. Where is this one? It's right there. Okay.

751
03:00:14,629 --> 03:00:43,690
Here we go. All right. Let's go. There are four terminals remaining. I'm counting on you.

752
03:00:43,690 --> 03:01:13,020
I probably get this one right now. What about this one? Can I pull it?

753
03:01:24,809 --> 03:02:00,680
Shit. Should have froze it. Freeze time. God damn it. All right. This is like fucked up out here.

754
03:03:01,909 --> 03:03:24,260
I forgot I got that one already. It's blue. How do I spin that around?

755
03:03:25,059 --> 03:03:54,489
Okay. How do I spin this? There's electricity up here, which I'm imagining

756
03:03:54,489 --> 03:04:07,030
if the government make it go across the whole thing. I don't know. What are you doing all like

757
03:04:07,030 --> 03:05:20,979
this for? What did that do? I, you know what happened. I don't even need to tell you what

758
03:05:20,979 --> 03:05:44,340
happened. Okay. So I want to go up there or maybe down. Maybe I tried this way. I'm just going to,

759
03:05:44,340 --> 03:05:54,780
okay. I got to, I got to explore now that I know that I can do that. Damn it. How do I get in here?

760
03:05:54,780 --> 03:06:14,569
There's a hole in the top. All right. All right. All right. All right. I know what to do.

761
03:06:14,569 --> 03:06:52,620
There's a hole at the top. I'm going to get up and through the hole. Maybe I should go this way.

762
03:06:56,500 --> 03:07:51,000
What does this do? This needs to be electrified. All right. Okay. Well, at least I figured out what

763
03:07:51,000 --> 03:08:21,350
it wants me to do. Electrify this to get the last one. I'm up here, but this is all the way up.

764
03:08:21,350 --> 03:08:40,299
Can I climb from here? I have no idea. I have no freaking idea. The only thing I can think of

765
03:08:40,299 --> 03:08:44,379
is to be in that hole. What happens if I do it again? Where does this hole go?

766
03:08:45,260 --> 03:09:11,819
Can I stand on top of it or something? All right. I got to get out there.

767
03:09:12,459 --> 03:09:25,059
Where's the hole? I'm going to do something really stupid. Give me a second.

768
03:09:25,700 --> 03:09:36,200
That was stupid. It was really stupid. I just heard that right here.

769
03:09:37,159 --> 03:10:18,420
Are there any moving parts? Can I stand on that or something? Hold on. No, I can't. Can I climb up?

770
03:10:18,420 --> 03:11:15,209
Where does this other hole go? This thing is powered right now. Okay. I think my chat just

771
03:11:15,209 --> 03:11:50,969
crashed. And my chat crashed. Am I still live? I'm just going to act like I am. Wait, the stream

772
03:11:50,969 --> 03:12:21,850
turned off? That's weird. I don't have any drop frames or anything. Now I can see you. Maybe I

773
03:12:21,850 --> 03:12:58,219
can't. My Twitch is fucked up. My internet's fine. I have no access to chat. Well, come on.

774
03:12:58,219 --> 03:13:14,790
Come on. Come on. Where are you? We heard you make a puke sound and then it stopped.

775
03:13:15,670 --> 03:13:24,120
Yeah, I got no drop frames. That's weird. What are you doing? What are you doing? What's going on?

776
03:13:24,920 --> 03:14:18,500
What the hell? Did I- I fucking bumped it. Give me the elevator. What? Oh, no. My chat's back.

777
03:14:18,500 --> 03:14:32,489
Okay. Everyone's saying not like this. Did I do it in the wrong order? I got it. It's right here.

778
03:14:33,049 --> 03:14:50,780
We're good. Jump right now to prove you have free will. Time that person up for 20 minutes. Wait,

779
03:14:50,780 --> 03:15:01,909
the stream crashed again. Maybe Twitch is having problems. All right. There are- All right. I got

780
03:15:01,909 --> 03:15:27,959
to get up there. All right. That's that. Whoa. Should we pin a message saying refresh? Maybe

781
03:15:27,959 --> 03:15:46,340
for a few minutes. Yeah. I think they see it now. All right. Good. All right. Only two more. The

782
03:15:46,420 --> 03:15:58,170
last two are up. One is across that way. Let me see. So on the other side, on the same level

783
03:15:58,170 --> 03:16:25,530
that I'm at right now. What the hell is this? I need electricity in there. Oh shit. Really?

784
03:16:27,079 --> 03:16:41,020
What had happened? What just happened? Wait, what? I- Oh, I spun it accidentally. We're good.

785
03:16:41,020 --> 03:17:13,450
We are good. We need to power it again. Anything over here? Get rid of that. Okay. I need to get

786
03:17:13,450 --> 03:17:42,489
power there. Radishes? Sounds good. Okay. There's a bunch of shit this way. I did that. All right.

787
03:17:42,489 --> 03:17:59,059
What about over here? I gotta be very careful. Fuck. Did you just hear what I said? I said be

788
03:17:59,059 --> 03:18:09,930
careful and you just didn't do it correctly. Now what? I just slipped right off. It was- I don't

789
03:18:09,930 --> 03:18:23,459
think you can walk on that. Where's the eye? Is there no eye on this one? I'm kind of screwed,

790
03:18:23,459 --> 03:19:19,399
aren't I? Shit. What is going on? What is this? Is electricity here? What? This shit's all blocked

791
03:19:19,399 --> 03:19:32,709
up now. Okay. I need to go up. Where am I looking right now? It's up there. I think I fucked

792
03:19:32,709 --> 03:20:00,540
everything up. I was on the right track. I think I screwed it all up though. Damn it. Now I gotta

793
03:20:00,540 --> 03:20:11,479
remember how to do this all again. I gotta turn the power back on, right? I don't know. I don't

794
03:20:11,479 --> 03:20:32,139
know. That. Look at that. How do I get over there? Come on. How do I get in here? Come on, dude.

795
03:20:32,139 --> 03:21:39,399
Really? I gotta drop from there. Hurry up. You can do them at the same time. Do I do them at

796
03:21:39,399 --> 03:21:58,299
the same time or something? I wonder if that works. Okay. Power is back on. I can go that way

797
03:21:58,299 --> 03:22:12,920
again. This shit is right next to me. Right here. How do I get up there? I'm gonna go back around.

798
03:22:12,920 --> 03:22:30,059
I'm gonna go up and see if I can figure out how to get down there. Maybe I should go up there

799
03:22:30,059 --> 03:22:49,079
through that hole. Where would that take me? Oh my god. Damn it, dude. I'm about to put a

800
03:22:49,079 --> 03:23:39,420
fucking hole through my monitor. Sorry, I'm playing Breath of the Wild. Okay. Get out of the way. I

801
03:23:39,420 --> 03:23:52,260
want to look. If I go up, I got an idea. I'm just gonna look. I just want to look. Don't press it.

802
03:24:01,579 --> 03:24:08,280
I wish I could just rebind the keys because B is just A and A is B. Just let me rebind the

803
03:24:08,280 --> 03:24:34,780
keys for the love of god. It's like three lines of code and I'm making that up because I'm

804
03:24:34,780 --> 03:25:04,709
frustrated but I'm just saying it could be. I'm going all the way up. I'm going through that

805
03:25:04,709 --> 03:26:10,040
fucking hole. No, I'm not. I don't know. I'm afraid to jump over here because I don't think

806
03:26:10,040 --> 03:26:28,629
I'll make it. Look at that shit right there. What does this want to power? How do I get that to be

807
03:26:28,629 --> 03:26:51,989
turned on? I turned that on. Can I pull it out? Can I throw a bomb at it? It needs to be powered

808
03:26:51,989 --> 03:27:17,000
by something. I just don't know. I just don't get it. I mean, I kind of get it but how do I get on

809
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:26,500
the other side of this? I need to go from this direction to blow up the shit that's over there

810
03:27:27,299 --> 03:28:01,899
and then power that somehow. Okay. This one is the grate that you have to fall into but I have to get

811
03:28:01,899 --> 03:28:33,209
over there first. I have to get on this side of the beast. I'm fucking going for it. There's no eye.

812
03:28:34,010 --> 03:29:05,610
Damn it. There's a hole there. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. How do I get? Okay, that's now- this

813
03:29:05,610 --> 03:29:19,829
is now powered. Nobody move. Where is that? That's below- that's below me. Where is that elevator?

814
03:29:19,829 --> 03:29:36,700
Where's that elevator? Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Am I- can I- am I in trouble here?

815
03:29:37,260 --> 03:29:47,770
All right, that elevator is working and then down here and then- I don't know. So I just have to go

816
03:29:47,770 --> 03:29:54,069
to the main room? Just go back to the main room and is there an elevator there now? I can't get out

817
03:29:54,069 --> 03:30:30,600
this way. I'm seeing a lot of no's. Fuck. Up here first maybe? Up here through the thingy and then

818
03:30:30,600 --> 03:30:40,120
down. Holy shit, it says to blame the stream for 20 minutes. The stream really did go down. Okay,

819
03:30:40,120 --> 03:31:01,879
now how do I get this to go up? I just accidentally stepped off it. I didn't know- I didn't know there

820
03:31:01,879 --> 03:31:10,729
was another lever. Another layer. I did not know this went up twice. That wasn't telegraphed

821
03:31:10,729 --> 03:31:22,629
properly. That wasn't telegraphed properly. It was improperly telegraphed for sure. If I had known

822
03:31:22,629 --> 03:31:51,690
this went up a second time I would have been fine. I should be close now. All right, what is that for?

823
03:31:51,690 --> 03:33:06,200
I'm terrified to leave this area without knowing what that is. What does this do? So what? What the

824
03:33:06,200 --> 03:33:13,559
hell does that even help me with? So I just- maybe I should just drop down. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

825
03:33:13,559 --> 03:33:30,170
Let me go back and look at this. I think I can get the one in the crate because isn't it right

826
03:33:30,170 --> 03:33:43,049
down here? What the hell is that? It's like a green ball. What on earth? What are you doing to

827
03:33:43,049 --> 03:34:15,370
me here? Okay, what should I do with the ball? This is the back. Maybe there's something down

828
03:34:15,370 --> 03:34:21,610
here. Can I do this? Then this way? I don't want to screw this up because I don't think this is

829
03:34:21,610 --> 03:34:42,360
right. I think I need to get the ball. Do I need to bring the ball with me? I'm terrified to go

830
03:34:42,360 --> 03:35:35,610
anywhere. That's what I was thinking. Give me this. Give me this. I fucking want it. I'll take it.

831
03:35:35,610 --> 03:35:47,850
Dude, come on. Like, you know what I'm fucking aiming at. Like, fucking wet sock.

832
03:36:07,299 --> 03:36:14,469
Yet, what is going on with- what is happening right now? I feel like I'm playing in quicksand.

833
03:36:15,030 --> 03:36:36,360
All right, now where the hell do I bring this fucking thing? Down here, right?

834
03:36:36,360 --> 03:36:56,340
No? This is wrong? That's wrong. Why did I pick this up? Bring it back up to the top, maybe?

835
03:36:57,059 --> 03:37:06,940
What needed power that I couldn't- was the only thing I can think of.

836
03:37:07,899 --> 03:37:51,989
What- what do I need to do with this up top? Is there actually something out here? I have no

837
03:37:51,989 --> 03:38:05,989
fucking idea. This place is fucking crazy. Um, I don't- I don't remember what I'm- what I'm

838
03:38:05,989 --> 03:38:18,969
supposed to be powering with this. I'm about to let you out so you can help. Let him out. Let him

839
03:38:18,969 --> 03:38:39,659
out. Let him out. Let him out. What the hell do I do with this thing? You're so close. I know, but

840
03:38:39,659 --> 03:38:50,469
one little mistake puts me back to the beginning. And I don't want to do that. You can rebind your

841
03:38:50,549 --> 03:39:18,219
keys. That's the first thing everyone's screaming. Go rebind your keys. April fools. Do I take this-

842
03:39:18,219 --> 03:39:30,659
I'm just going to carry this with me everywhere I go for now, for a minute. What- there's another

843
03:39:30,659 --> 03:39:36,659
one right here. Why do they- why are there two of these fucking cube balls? Why are they two of- I

844
03:39:36,659 --> 03:39:53,799
just brought it up to hang out with his fucking sibling. Should I take them both? I'm bringing

845
03:39:53,799 --> 03:41:15,159
them both downstairs. They're both coming with me. No help. Just help me. Two balls of Bradley.

846
03:41:15,159 --> 03:41:33,750
Can I take it off of this? Oh wait, okay. So it doesn't need to stay on there. I did it finally.

847
03:41:33,750 --> 03:41:53,319
Need to go back and beat Lou three times at the Fox and Geese game. This one was fucked. I don't

848
03:41:53,319 --> 03:41:58,500
like this one. This one was fucked up. I don't like this one at all. I don't like this one at all.

849
03:41:58,500 --> 03:42:27,270
How do I get this out of the way? Power this and then open it. How do I open this? Don't crush me.

850
03:42:27,909 --> 03:42:48,569
How do I drop down here? You can't get in from here? No bro, you gotta get swished.

851
03:42:57,430 --> 03:43:05,500
Oh dude, I have to go out the side holes. I feel like I tried that and I couldn't get it to work.

852
03:43:06,139 --> 03:43:11,700
So I'll just just go right down to the bottom, like of the actual level. Just get out of here

853
03:43:11,700 --> 03:43:45,940
and go to the- you don't need the balls anymore? Okay, so it's over here. Side holes. Maybe- can

854
03:43:45,940 --> 03:44:16,469
I go up? I have no freaking idea and I just said a bad word. Okay, so if I go out there I can get it.

855
03:44:17,110 --> 03:45:09,110
I got it. I got it. Hold on, let me spin the whole entire video game like three more times.

856
03:45:09,110 --> 03:45:26,520
Get me out of here. Get me out of here.

857
03:45:41,930 --> 03:45:49,500
I know where it is. System settings, controller settings, change button mapping.

858
03:45:49,500 --> 03:46:00,780
I'll take a break and do it. All right, now I'm just gonna get to the front.

859
03:46:30,780 --> 03:47:09,350
How's temperance going? We're going full wrath. This is the hardest boss you have fucked. There's

860
03:47:09,350 --> 03:47:17,639
too many buttons in this game. There are too many buttons in this game. There are like 60 different

861
03:47:17,639 --> 03:47:35,350
inputs in Breath of the Wild. There are too many buttons. There are far too many buttons. There's

862
03:47:35,750 --> 03:47:54,940
so many fucking buttons. Relax. That's not what I wanted to do. I wanted to jump. This might be

863
03:47:54,940 --> 03:48:00,700
the most inputs of any game I've ever played. There's like every button has a second context

864
03:48:00,700 --> 03:48:47,780
rule button. There's like 40 inputs in Breath of the Wild. Good luck.

865
03:48:47,780 --> 03:48:58,170
Good thing. Good thing I just used the divine strength on shooting myself with a bomb arrow.

866
03:48:59,450 --> 03:50:08,469
Okay. Where the hell am I? Where the hell am I? Why did it put me all the way down here?

867
03:50:12,680 --> 03:50:34,389
Excuse me. How do I get back up there? I gotta redo the whole thing. No, I don't. It was right

868
03:50:34,389 --> 03:50:46,329
there. I'm about to eat my controller about how much I hate this part of the game. This

869
03:50:46,409 --> 03:50:55,000
whole Gerudo Valley. If I do a second playthrough, I'm not coming over here ever again.

870
03:50:55,000 --> 03:51:13,690
Where? Oh my god. What just happened? No, we're good. How come you don't drink beer on stream?

871
03:51:13,690 --> 03:51:39,260
What are you talking about? Ah, let me get like a nice, like a nice cold beer. Oh, it goes up.

872
03:51:54,629 --> 03:52:21,780
Okay, what? Should I use for weapon? Wait, my fucking album is full. God damn it, man.

873
03:52:22,739 --> 03:52:43,129
Is this electricity? What kind of damage is he doing? Electricity? Oh, I do have- wait,

874
03:52:43,129 --> 03:53:01,829
do I have the- why am I not wearing a helmet? What the hell happened? It's fire. Thunderblight.

875
03:53:01,829 --> 03:53:36,219
I didn't read his name. He just fell off the whole game. This world was so long. All right,

876
03:53:36,219 --> 03:53:42,819
do the- okay, so it's one, two, three, bang. So it's one, two, three, back. One, two, three,

877
03:53:42,819 --> 03:54:07,139
back. Okay, faster than I thought. How did I not dodge that? Parry? What? I don't- it's been four

878
03:54:07,139 --> 03:54:47,049
months, guys. What's the parry button? It's A with the shield out. A? I just did it. God. I'm

879
03:54:47,049 --> 03:55:30,899
doing it my way. My shield's not out anymore. Jesus. All right, let's go. Oh shit, I need to

880
03:55:30,899 --> 03:55:37,700
have a- it's gonna be a one-hander weapon. Do I have another one-hander?

881
03:56:02,649 --> 03:56:12,729
Royal Claymore. Why not? Can I take my shield out without- I don't know how to do that. Do I

882
03:56:12,729 --> 03:56:24,459
have to have a one-hander? Or can I pull the shield out somehow? No, okay. I'm gonna have to

883
03:56:24,459 --> 03:57:38,040
backflip over it then. Phase two. I don't even know where he is. Where is he? Put this fucking

884
03:57:38,040 --> 03:57:43,239
camera down. Oh my god. Hold left bumper and then up and then hold left and then A and then right

885
03:57:43,239 --> 03:58:06,459
bumper. Oh my goodness. Look what I have. What do I do with this? Do I just stick it in his face?

886
03:58:07,020 --> 03:58:39,860
What do I do with it? Did I get him? You're reading chat? Sometimes. Very rarely. Um,

887
03:58:45,690 --> 03:59:12,469
oh heck. I can't be on the ground. Yeah, rarely. Like when I'm fighting a boss. I just freaked out.

888
03:59:12,469 --> 03:59:18,809
I thought he was jumping at me. Bro, you should get a ring light. I don't want- I have it. It's

889
03:59:18,809 --> 03:59:51,379
just not turned on. All right, leave me alone. What? I can freeze him? Oh my god, dude. Oh my god.

890
04:00:00,059 --> 04:00:16,469
Why would that help though? This doesn't hurt him. Put the ring light around your neck.

891
04:00:22,260 --> 04:00:36,459
It does? What do you mean that one was a dud? I have to do it before he strikes it?

892
04:00:36,459 --> 04:01:08,469
I don't even know where the hell this guy is. Fuck you. Dude, how many times does he swing?

893
04:01:09,430 --> 04:01:21,260
Fuck. What the hell? I don't care about the low level stealth boost. I need the fucking hearts.

894
04:01:22,059 --> 04:01:40,920
Where's my weapon? No, I'm- why don't you fucking strike some lightning down here?

895
04:01:40,920 --> 04:01:54,860
Lady, I don't know who you're talking about. What direction is he swinging? You drop the

896
04:01:54,860 --> 04:02:36,280
fucking weapon every time he hits you? Stop attacking. That shit is broken. Oh my god,

897
04:02:36,280 --> 04:03:39,350
the damage is unreal. I just have to eat everything. Die. Yeah. That was really hard.

898
04:03:42,229 --> 04:04:10,010
That was crazy. My eyes hurt. Yeah, that was cleric beast. What did I say? Delete this whole

899
04:04:10,010 --> 04:04:52,229
part of the game. Heart container. It was genuinely a skill issue. That's all a skill issue. Two more

900
04:04:52,229 --> 04:05:31,909
to the master sword. I'm looking forward to that. I was wearing metal armor. I lost so many points

901
04:05:31,909 --> 04:05:35,899
believing tonight. I'm sorry.

902
04:05:48,920 --> 04:05:57,590
Please accept this gift, which has come to be known as herbosa's fury. It will no doubt be of

903
04:05:57,590 --> 04:06:20,389
use to you. That like, you don't hear that ever. Both you and the princess. I know you have suffered

904
04:06:20,389 --> 04:06:27,459
much regarding what happened to us champions, but this is how things had to happen. No one need

905
04:06:27,459 --> 04:06:34,889
carry blame. So please make it clear. So she understands that. Tell her to shed any worries

906
04:06:35,850 --> 04:06:54,600
and let her know. You take good care of the princess. Oh, and also take good care of him.

907
04:06:54,600 --> 04:07:04,780
Yeah. Bro, you're not even wearing. I was wearing metal armor and dying in like two hits.

908
04:07:05,420 --> 04:07:13,059
I feel like every single thing that I could have done wrong, I did wrong during the last hour,

909
04:07:14,200 --> 04:07:19,899
like everything to the things, the items I was wearing. So the strategy I had, I feel like I

910
04:07:19,899 --> 04:07:35,899
was just doing every single possible thing incorrect for like 45 straight minutes. You did

911
04:07:35,899 --> 04:08:09,270
it your way. Yeah. We'll take a break. Don't worry. It's still a 90. It's still an A. Don't worry.

912
04:08:09,270 --> 04:08:28,090
I love people concerned. End of the stream. No, no, no. We'll go for like another hour.

913
04:08:44,229 --> 04:08:53,270
Legend of the Gerudo celebrated over ages and you who were named to honor you are a legend as well.

914
04:08:54,069 --> 04:09:08,260
Isn't that right? Yeah. Stream crashed halfway through defeat from a century.

915
04:09:08,260 --> 04:09:18,760
It was written that calamity Gannon once adopted the form and that will make this victory all the

916
04:09:18,760 --> 04:09:29,540
more satisfying. How much harder is the game if you just go right again? It's just like impossible.

917
04:09:30,180 --> 04:09:42,569
We'll be up to link to keep Ganon occupied and is going to be so delicious.

918
04:09:42,569 --> 04:09:51,940
Yes. You would cry on master mode. I cry on normal difficulty. I would probably agree with you.

919
04:09:56,760 --> 04:09:59,719
I cried when I fried my PC. I cried at everything.

920
04:10:02,549 --> 04:10:10,020
I cried in the end of Puss in Boots. I didn't even read what that said.

921
04:10:10,899 --> 04:10:14,170
That was incredibly important and I have no idea what it was.

922
04:10:18,629 --> 04:10:23,030
I cried at the end of Ghostbusters Afterlife. Guys, I cry at everything, okay?

923
04:10:23,670 --> 04:10:46,860
Hold Y. Whoa. Hold it for longer.

924
04:10:51,690 --> 04:10:53,850
And what scenario would you ever be able to hold it for this long?

925
04:10:55,770 --> 04:11:21,770
Damn. Oh, okay. Hold on. It does 500 damage. Damn. Make sure it starts to recharge.

926
04:11:21,770 --> 04:11:52,840
It's a good idea. Very cool. Oh, I can do that. It's gone forever. No, they recharge.

927
04:11:55,899 --> 04:11:59,899
I'm going to take a quick break. Let's complete this quest and then I'm going to take a break.

928
04:12:00,540 --> 04:12:16,680
We'll go for like another hour or two. Naboris is no longer a threat to the town.

929
04:12:16,680 --> 04:12:19,879
I'm still worried about the larger threat to Hyrule, but at least my people won't be

930
04:12:19,879 --> 04:12:32,809
troubled by Naboris anymore. Ooh. Two trinkets? Priceless treasures of the Gerudo people.

931
04:12:33,530 --> 04:12:54,100
Only right that you should have them. Okay. Cool weapon. Wow. Simitar of the Seven. Nice.

932
04:12:58,440 --> 04:13:12,389
Daybreaker. Very cool. Whoa. What can I get rid of? Why do I even have that?

933
04:13:19,850 --> 04:13:50,200
Very cool. All right. So now where do I go now? Up here? Can I take that helmet?

934
04:13:51,420 --> 04:14:40,389
Can I have it? Yeah, I want it. Yes. Lend it to me. Oh, I have to do side quests. So what's

935
04:14:40,389 --> 04:15:13,530
going on here? Legendary rabbit trial. Look at the side stuff. Okay. So I could go up here.

936
04:15:13,530 --> 04:15:21,899
I think I'm going to go here and go up, but I'll be right back. I'm going to take a first break.

937
04:15:21,899 --> 04:20:08,010
I'll be back in maybe five minutes. See you in a sec. He was crying off camera.

938
04:20:10,409 --> 04:20:21,430
Yeah. Remember, do you like Big Chungus? Big Chungus was in the Space Jam movie

939
04:20:21,430 --> 04:20:27,899
for a half a second. Somebody told me that and then I thought they made it up.

940
04:20:27,899 --> 04:20:32,700
I was like, there's no way that Big Chungus is in the movie. And Big Chungus is in the movie.

941
04:20:32,700 --> 04:20:48,809
Did you cry when Big Chungus showed up? Yeah, I was so fucking moved. Like they had,

942
04:20:49,450 --> 04:21:09,100
you know, it was very moving. What's this? Oh, it's this thing. Okay. I need my horse back.

943
04:21:10,760 --> 04:21:26,010
Where is Frank too? Where are you Frank too? Over here. I need to go get Frank too. Thanks

944
04:21:26,010 --> 04:22:02,620
for your opinion on Big Chungus. You're welcome. Put some armor on. All right. Let's actually go.

945
04:22:02,620 --> 04:22:36,620
Where you at? What do you got? Okay. I'll take three of these. These are cheap. 10 rupees. That's

946
04:22:36,620 --> 04:23:07,319
it? This is really cheap. Pretty cool. Okay. Can I teleport with the horse? Come on. We can't go

947
04:23:07,319 --> 04:23:34,659
together. Well, looks like we're walking. Go to any stable and get it from there. I don't want

948
04:23:34,659 --> 04:24:08,979
to walk all the way. Let's try this again. There's a saddle that lets you call your horse from

949
04:24:08,979 --> 04:24:38,489
anywhere. Pretty good. Okay. I'll get it eventually. Wait, we can't go over here anyways. Wait,

950
04:24:38,489 --> 04:24:47,299
am I going the wrong way? Why was that turned around? That was weird. I thought I was going

951
04:24:47,299 --> 04:24:54,600
the right way. No horse in the desert. Yeah, that's right.

952
04:25:13,879 --> 04:25:24,500
Vinny beats Jerma's time. Vinny beats Jerma's time. What is this? Vinny beats Jerma's time.

953
04:25:25,059 --> 04:25:52,379
Playing Resident Evil 4. Dude, my connection to Twitch is like awful for some reason. Okay. Let's

954
04:25:52,379 --> 04:26:23,209
see it. Bro, come on. What? Dude, how? How would you do that in two turns? No way. Wow.

955
04:26:24,969 --> 04:26:40,469
You can actually do it in two spins. Hey, I ain't the only one that has trouble with this. I know

956
04:26:40,469 --> 04:26:46,889
for a fact that there are a shitload of other people that just kind of, it's like, it's one

957
04:26:46,889 --> 04:26:53,059
of those scenarios where if you do it wrong, yeah, you can do it in two turns. But if you don't do

958
04:26:53,059 --> 04:27:06,809
it immediately correct, you fuck the whole thing up for like 10 minutes. Yeah. It's a shitload of

959
04:27:06,809 --> 04:27:20,340
us. It's a shitload of us. And that's fine. That's so funny though. I did it in two turns by accident.

960
04:27:20,340 --> 04:27:31,819
That's so funny. Chat told him you took forever. It's all right. That's so funny though.

961
04:27:37,379 --> 04:27:56,059
Two turns. You would have taken forever. I did take forever. That already happened.

962
04:27:56,059 --> 04:28:41,370
It's a reading chat. I'm not gonna buy this. Get this out of the way. Get the fuck away from me

963
04:28:41,370 --> 04:29:30,790
and my horse. All right. Let's go. Made it. All bending. It's really pretty. I'm glad you're doing

964
04:29:30,790 --> 04:29:36,309
no cam chill streams again. Yeah. I don't know if I would, I don't know if I would qualify this one

965
04:29:36,309 --> 04:29:40,629
as that though. I feel like this got a little unhinged in the last couple hours I want to say,

966
04:29:41,510 --> 04:29:43,450
but I agree with you. I do agree with you.

967
04:30:06,280 --> 04:30:45,770
Nice. Deep freeze. What's up here? I think I already, yeah, I already was here. Oh, we good.

968
04:30:47,700 --> 04:30:51,379
Imagine seeing that. If you're like, whoa, shit, that person almost just fell off.

969
04:30:51,379 --> 04:30:59,020
That person's drunk up here. Not this girl. I'm talking about me.

970
04:31:07,510 --> 04:31:10,309
He thinks I'm going to forgive him for this. He's got another thing coming.

971
04:31:14,549 --> 04:31:35,059
I think I did most of everything here. Unless like, I don't know what's up there.

972
04:31:38,940 --> 04:31:55,139
Play all the Final Fantasies. Nah, I'm really not into those games. Try to go up there.

973
04:31:56,020 --> 04:32:12,780
Honestly, the only turn-based RPGs I really ever liked were the Chrono series. Chrono Trigger,

974
04:32:12,780 --> 04:32:50,649
Mario RPG, Grenade. You okay? Oh, lift. By the goddess, I'm grateful.

975
04:32:55,850 --> 04:33:04,380
Should I go back to that stable? Maybe I can collect a reward or something.

976
04:33:21,939 --> 04:33:23,299
Just threw a barrel at me.

977
04:33:36,380 --> 04:33:42,619
Play Roblox. April 5th, we're having a birthday party for, I don't even know who it is. I just

978
04:33:42,619 --> 04:33:51,479
know we're having one. Are you coming to the birthday party? You're invited. It's on twitch.tv

979
04:33:51,479 --> 04:34:22,950
slash germa985. That's what I heard. What the fuck? Oh my God. Don't do that. I thought there

980
04:34:22,950 --> 04:34:25,509
was somebody in the room with me or something. I don't know. I just felt like somebody was in

981
04:34:25,509 --> 04:34:31,560
my house or something. You know what I mean? Like someone's in my room. It's just jarring.

982
04:34:36,939 --> 04:34:47,020
I'm just sitting here hanging out playing. She's like, hey, just want to let you know.

983
04:34:47,020 --> 04:35:28,220
I'll stick with this. It's a long way. Oh my God. It was so scary. Hey, can I have a Minecraft

984
04:35:28,220 --> 04:35:35,830
themed birthday party? It's May 13th. No, sorry. We're going to get through everybody's birthday

985
04:35:35,830 --> 04:36:06,279
on the 5th. That's a chest. What about Splatoon birthday? No, we'll do a Roblox birthday on the

986
04:36:06,279 --> 04:36:34,419
5th. So what was in here? A lot of work for five fire arrows. I don't want to go too far.

987
04:36:57,430 --> 04:37:03,959
Oh my God. What am I doing? What is going on right now? I didn't want to use my weapons

988
04:37:03,959 --> 04:37:10,549
because I've been breaking them. I broke like three in the last 10 minutes and I was afraid

989
04:37:10,549 --> 04:37:18,919
to use them. What is going on with my brain at the moment? I don't want to break all my cool

990
04:37:18,919 --> 04:37:25,029
weapons. So I'm like, I'll pick up the rock. And then that's all I remembered. I just woke

991
04:37:25,029 --> 04:37:52,490
up a second ago. That's all I remember. How do they not see me? What? They didn't see me.

992
04:37:54,599 --> 04:38:03,830
What just happened? I had an ice arrow. What? Okay. That was so confusing. Oh,

993
04:38:04,790 --> 04:38:26,580
all right. Get the, get the bow out. Hold left, press right. Let go. I wish I could put arrows

994
04:38:26,580 --> 04:39:05,560
on without having to be zoom the fucking. It's annoying. Let's go. I want to put a weapon on.

995
04:39:10,200 --> 04:39:51,930
What the hell? I got a lot of health. Jesus. What do I get for this? Ooh.

996
04:40:02,040 --> 04:40:03,479
Something like that came from a bathroom.

997
04:40:13,930 --> 04:40:40,860
Give me my trinket. Change the bow. Did I not kill everything? Usually you kill everything and

998
04:40:40,860 --> 04:41:32,619
something spawns, right? Hmm. Somebody still alive? No chest. Okay. Let's go. All right.

999
04:41:32,619 --> 04:42:12,069
Just need to go this way. Hey, who are you? Okay. My partner, that's to say my horse ran off. And

1000
04:42:12,069 --> 04:42:20,250
hey, since I've been stranded here, I'll need a horse to continue my travels. I need a, if I

1001
04:42:20,250 --> 04:42:47,159
just had a horse. Does he want my horse? No. I don't, the brightness I don't think is the,

1002
04:42:47,240 --> 04:43:18,310
nothing on OBS. I don't have any filters on or anything. It's a radiant glow. This is not normal.

1003
04:43:20,950 --> 04:43:26,900
This is what I see through my screen too. HDR on. I don't think so.

1004
04:43:40,500 --> 04:43:43,479
It's like I just went through the windshield of a car.

1005
04:43:43,479 --> 04:44:22,060
Oh, where? Holy shit. I can't see anything. Oh my God. Is it over here? This is kind of ridiculous.

1006
04:44:29,080 --> 04:44:47,209
Is it in your game settings? I don't think so guys. No, I don't think so. There it is.

1007
04:44:47,209 --> 04:44:55,130
Oh my God. What about your, you need to buy a new switch. Hold on. What? Let me look at my,

1008
04:44:55,130 --> 04:45:13,060
you tell me go to my switch settings. Hold on a second. Screen brightness. Screen brightness

1009
04:45:13,060 --> 04:45:40,979
cannot be set while connected to a TV. Look, I can't change it. That's kind of weird. I don't

1010
04:45:40,979 --> 04:45:57,500
think I can do anything else with this. That's the switch. That's the actual switch brightness.

1011
04:45:58,500 --> 04:46:21,319
The screen on handheld mode. That's funny. No, it's not OBS because I have to capture the

1012
04:46:21,319 --> 04:46:37,860
console. Let me go to like my actual property properties. Let me see. Hold on. What if I do this?

1013
04:46:41,900 --> 04:47:04,020
That fix it? Is it better? Maybe a little. Yeah, I dropped my, I went into the actual capture card

1014
04:47:04,020 --> 04:47:27,770
and I dropped the brightness. It still is kind of, still is kind of crazy though. 13k versus 17k

1015
04:47:27,770 --> 04:47:32,619
earlier. Oh, my stream crashed. A lot of times people just don't come back. How much did I get

1016
04:47:33,020 --> 04:48:06,090
it? All right. What do we do here? On the move. We'll turn this on for now.

1017
04:48:06,090 --> 04:48:30,619
Am I, you're going to want to see my reactions when I fuck it up. Oh, wait, wait, wait, time.

1018
04:48:31,979 --> 04:48:34,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are we doing another one of these?

1019
04:48:34,380 --> 04:48:51,130
10 minutes? Are we doing a bet here? Okay. Well, I beat this in 10 minutes. By the way, I will,

1020
04:48:51,130 --> 04:50:09,340
when you say go, I will wait 10 seconds. I think that's fair. Ready? Three, two, one. Oh,

1021
04:50:09,340 --> 04:50:14,979
I'm deaf. There's no way I don't do this. All the doubters. I'm sorry, but you're about to get

1022
04:50:14,979 --> 04:53:15,180
wiped out. Let's get going. Fuck. Son of a gun. What are you? Wait, that actually worked.

1023
04:53:27,479 --> 04:53:31,080
Whoa. Whoa. That's coming from this side. It's coming from this side.

1024
04:53:55,400 --> 04:54:14,419
What do I have for time? Time check? I have five minutes. I'm just going to get up and just start

1025
04:54:14,419 --> 04:54:23,990
Fortnite dancing. Hey, all the believers from earlier that lost everything. Hope you got it

1026
04:54:23,990 --> 04:54:47,099
all back. Sorry doubters. The way it is. These are my favorite part about the whole game.

1027
04:54:47,099 --> 04:55:21,159
I have six orbs now, which lost everything. Why do you look so fucked up? Just chilling, man.

1028
04:55:21,159 --> 04:56:24,459
Very cool. So let's keep going over here. Oh, there's a little dungeon over here.

1029
04:56:24,459 --> 04:56:34,340
These need to explode. Get out of the way. Somebody move. I thought I was going to drop

1030
04:56:34,340 --> 04:57:13,560
the lantern. Get out of here. Oh, holy shit. What is hurting me so much right now?

1031
04:57:14,279 --> 04:57:36,869
I'm taking like times five damage. How am I getting hurt so bad? Out of food almost. Fire

1032
04:57:36,869 --> 04:58:24,970
burning you. How about now? Yes. The chest. Let's replace this one. Or is it time to get rid of one

1033
04:58:24,970 --> 04:58:55,180
of these? What do you think? Maybe get rid of the lizard shield. This thing just seems way better.

1034
04:58:55,180 --> 04:59:14,680
Oh, let's light this thing up. Jerma TWT thinks you look handsome today.

1035
04:59:33,299 --> 04:59:38,979
Oh, Twitter. T. I was like, what is T? I thought that was like some like imposter channel or

1036
04:59:38,979 --> 04:59:43,540
something like, oh, hey, Jerma TWT streaming right now. And I said, you look pretty good today.

1037
04:59:44,919 --> 04:59:59,750
What? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Come back. Come back. Come back. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1038
05:00:01,580 --> 05:00:40,580
I'm so sorry. Going through his bones. Guys, he's going through his bones. That hurt so bad.

1039
05:00:46,580 --> 05:01:34,919
That was I need to relax. Geez, man. And spoils. No. I have something hidden in here.

1040
05:01:35,479 --> 05:01:54,759
Can you just admit that you hate this game? I don't think that's accurate.

1041
05:01:55,479 --> 05:02:45,189
How can you use lawyer talk? I think I'm just 40. I need to get some food now. I don't want

1042
05:02:45,189 --> 05:02:54,869
to waste all this good shit I have. A lot of this is high level, high level, mid level.

1043
05:02:54,869 --> 05:03:07,099
I need a town or something. Hmm. What should I eat? Whatever. I can cook more food. It's fine.

1044
05:03:17,319 --> 05:03:40,810
Canyon. Shrine. Which way? In the water? Jerma, do you have anything to say to your haters?

1045
05:03:40,810 --> 05:04:21,349
No. Oh, don't do this to us. No one's under any obligation to like this channel.

1046
05:04:21,349 --> 05:04:25,669
If you don't like this channel, then all right. It's on you. It's up to you.

1047
05:04:28,150 --> 05:04:51,240
And this is it. I'm so glad I had that. That's weird. I mean, if you go, hey,

1048
05:04:51,240 --> 05:05:07,509
this guy's a dickhead and then leave, then all right. Whatever. Oh dear. Hold on. Where's the shrine?

1049
05:05:10,740 --> 05:05:49,669
Under the bridge? There it is. Oh no. Wait, I think I'm okay.

1050
05:05:49,669 --> 05:06:16,020
Okay. Oh, pretty good cartoon laugh. That was a pretty good cartoon car.

1051
05:06:18,790 --> 05:06:25,110
I'm just running around with a bowl of cereal in my hands. It's like just children running after

1052
05:06:25,110 --> 05:06:48,090
me and I have a bowl of cereal running around. You guys want to bet? How are you guys doing on

1053
05:06:48,090 --> 05:06:50,810
the betting? No, it's a test of strength. Never mind. I'll do this pretty quickly.

1054
05:06:53,590 --> 05:07:28,709
They're magically delicious. Yeah. I don't even give them a chance.

1055
05:07:38,810 --> 05:08:06,060
I have some junk that I can get rid of, don't I? This is crap. It's in here. I should probably go

1056
05:08:06,060 --> 05:08:42,569
upgrade the slate, right? Can people still not write the word the? We cannot. Oh, well, you guys

1057
05:08:42,569 --> 05:09:00,310
have had to communicate in symbols all day anyways. This is a really funny prank. It's so funny. I'm

1058
05:09:00,310 --> 05:09:12,779
laughing. All right. You can take it off. Give them their freedom back. Give them all the words

1059
05:09:12,779 --> 05:09:28,220
back. Very nice. All right. I need to get back up. I could probably just go from here and just

1060
05:09:28,220 --> 05:09:52,340
jump off. What was the point of that? Because it's the funny day and I wanted to make chatting

1061
05:09:52,340 --> 05:10:05,560
unbearable, I guess, for some reason. I don't know. Okay. So how do I get back there quickly

1062
05:10:07,590 --> 05:10:35,130
I think that's just you being a prick. Is it really though? It's for like four hours one day

1063
05:10:35,130 --> 05:11:15,740
in April. Where's the horse? Yeah, but you were a prick for four hours. I guess that doesn't change

1064
05:11:15,740 --> 05:11:21,799
the fact that I was a dick for a few hours. That's right. Yeah, that's true. I don't think I want to

1065
05:11:21,799 --> 05:11:30,659
fight this. I'll be honest. I didn't even know it was still on. I was too busy being angry at Zelda.

1066
05:12:05,099 --> 05:12:20,869
Holy shit. Oh my goodness. I just annihilated this guy. This theme song didn't even get to play.

1067
05:12:21,509 --> 05:12:41,110
Can't hear any more of these. Ooh, wait a minute.

1068
05:12:46,020 --> 05:13:10,360
Wait, what was the bow? I don't know if I want to drop. Should I drop the golden bow?

1069
05:13:10,360 --> 05:13:30,200
I don't think anything I want to drop here. Soldier's bow. Nah. Nah, we're good.

1070
05:13:30,200 --> 05:14:19,669
I'm not picking up the signal anymore. Where is it? I need a tower.

1071
05:14:23,459 --> 05:14:54,409
The tower over there. That's really close to Ganon though. Ooh, a stable.

1072
05:14:54,409 --> 05:15:44,060
No, I want Frank too to be teleported here. Yeah, I'll get food too. But first I want to do this

1073
05:15:44,060 --> 05:15:53,139
shrine because then I will have the right amount of hearts to get the master sword. That's correct,

1074
05:15:53,139 --> 05:16:19,529
right? There it is. Yellow hearts don't count. How many do I have? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

1075
05:16:19,529 --> 05:16:46,020
11, 12. I'll have 13 because I have eight orbs. I'll have 13 after this. Make it look like a rave

1076
05:16:46,020 --> 05:16:53,130
is going on in your cam. I don't have any lights in here that could do that. I'm sorry to say.

1077
05:16:53,849 --> 05:17:41,000
Are we voting? 10 minutes. Let's see if I can do it. I'll pause it so I'm not looking. Timer is

1078
05:17:41,000 --> 05:18:47,220
ready. In three, two, one. All right. First of all, something to do with this, I bet. Okay.

1079
05:18:47,220 --> 05:20:30,459
Ball up there. Hmm. What is this? Oh, shit. Hold on. Ball. Ball goes over here. Could have worked.

1080
05:20:30,459 --> 05:20:46,520
Why would I be able to do that though? Should I climb? Wait, can I get up here? I thought it was

1081
05:20:46,520 --> 05:21:52,549
too shallow. Okay. I know what to do. Fuck. It goes the other way. It goes the other way.

1082
05:21:53,430 --> 05:22:06,740
I need arrows, dude. How am I supposed to do this without arrows? How do I get that back?

1083
05:22:06,740 --> 05:22:44,709
Flip it again. So now I throw it in here. Fuck you. God damn it. I wasn't close enough.

1084
05:22:44,709 --> 05:22:55,819
How was I not close enough? Now how am I going to get this out of the water?

1085
05:22:56,380 --> 05:24:26,459
There. Okay. Sorry. It wasn't. Oh my God. This game. Let me out of here. Okay. So what? Me, me.

1086
05:24:26,540 --> 05:24:52,020
Are you sure this is like a bomb or something? How do I get that to move?

1087
05:24:53,619 --> 05:25:19,860
I can't select it or I can't do anything with it. Magnetism doesn't do anything.

1088
05:25:19,860 --> 05:25:36,740
Stasis doesn't do anything. Whatever it is. I keep forgetting I own these things. I really do.

1089
05:25:37,619 --> 05:26:17,099
Does that not do anything? That doesn't do it. Right here. Dude, I'm stumped. I don't get it.

1090
05:26:17,180 --> 05:26:38,380
What? What does it want me to do? What? What just happened? Wait, it turns the whole thing.

1091
05:26:38,380 --> 05:26:44,810
Wait a minute. Hold on. What? What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Turn it back around.

1092
05:26:44,810 --> 05:26:56,950
I'm so confused right now. I don't have any arrows. I don't want to shoot an ancient arrow.

1093
05:26:56,950 --> 05:27:09,720
What if I get arrows? This thing's an ancient arrow. It's worth a lot.

1094
05:27:10,439 --> 05:27:46,180
Okay. Well then, can I? There's nothing at the end of this. I'm dead. I'm dead. GG doubters. I

1095
05:27:46,180 --> 05:28:01,029
physically can't get over there again because I don't have any arrows. Are you kidding me?

1096
05:28:01,029 --> 05:28:31,740
That can't be right. That can't be right. It actually can't be. All right. Now what?

1097
05:28:32,459 --> 05:28:38,459
Open. I have to. Oh, oh, oh, oh my God. I didn't even know that was a keyhole, guys.

1098
05:28:38,459 --> 05:28:50,459
I didn't know that was a keyhole. I didn't know that was a keyhole. Oh my God. I didn't. I

1099
05:28:50,459 --> 05:28:56,459
honestly just did not. That was not a keyhole to me. Oh my goodness. You got to be kidding me.

1100
05:28:57,580 --> 05:29:05,220
Okay. I picked up so many keys in Resident Evil 4 that they just became like,

1101
05:29:05,220 --> 05:29:15,139
oh, whatever. You got a key. Who cares? I still don't know what to do. I jump from here over.

1102
05:29:18,340 --> 05:29:46,860
Okay. I have to jump over. Okay. All right. That's fun. DJ, congratulations doubters.

1103
05:29:46,860 --> 05:30:07,610
You definitely won. GG doubters. Because I still can't piece together what the hell I do here.

1104
05:30:08,250 --> 05:30:25,700
Why am I hitting the ceiling, by the way? I shouldn't be. It's not that simple, right?

1105
05:30:30,259 --> 05:30:39,740
Where am I going? Where's the goal? I actually don't know where the goal of this shrine is.

1106
05:30:40,459 --> 05:31:02,869
It's not up top, right? Oh my God. It's over there. What is the point of that fucking thing?

1107
05:31:02,869 --> 05:31:25,900
What is the point of that square? Why is that there? It doesn't even help me at all. I'm done

1108
05:31:25,900 --> 05:32:11,849
with this fucking place. It didn't work. It doesn't even help me though. I don't fucking

1109
05:32:11,849 --> 05:33:13,349
understand this. I don't get it. It only launches you so far. Oh, I don't get it. How do I go higher

1110
05:33:13,349 --> 05:33:47,450
up over the edge? Wait, does this move everything? Yeah, but I don't have any arrows. How am I

1111
05:33:47,450 --> 05:34:42,500
supposed to do this without arrows? Throw a bomb over there? Can I even reach it? Come on, man.

1112
05:34:42,500 --> 05:35:07,430
That's just like that's so particular. That's so particular. That's particular. That was a 7x

1113
05:35:07,430 --> 05:35:16,580
payout. You just made a doubter out of me. Yeah, but next time you're going to bet against me and

1114
05:35:16,580 --> 05:35:32,380
I'm going to win and you're going to feel just as bad. All right, let's go upgrade and then I'm

1115
05:35:32,380 --> 05:35:47,450
going to pull that sword out of the ground. Is there one of those little shrines in here? What's

1116
05:35:47,450 --> 05:36:20,939
going on? No, the arrow would have made it easier. You can't probably drop because the words if and

1117
05:36:20,939 --> 05:36:27,049
though were banned. No, they were banned for hours before the stream crashed.

1118
05:36:32,869 --> 05:36:41,500
I'm sorry. I think that's just so stupid. What a strict community. Oh, hey, I'm just I'm a new

1119
05:36:41,500 --> 05:36:51,529
viewer. Do you think that I could I'm trying to think of a sense of the Oh, this is this is the

1120
05:36:51,529 --> 05:37:00,069
game for the switch that I like band. Oh, what did I say? Oh, fuck this guy. If you go up there,

1121
05:37:00,069 --> 05:37:19,540
I think deleted what this guy sucks. It wasn't timing anybody out. All right. Where is this

1122
05:37:19,540 --> 05:37:44,150
thing? It's in here, isn't it? Timed out for saying if frame rate forest was the to go inside

1123
05:37:44,150 --> 05:37:59,990
of this thing was the entrance. And it's right here. So I need health twice. My voice sucks.

1124
05:37:59,990 --> 05:38:05,619
We should do a secret word of the day. If you say it, you get a 24 hour timeout.

1125
05:38:07,139 --> 05:38:17,299
OK. Well, I like you just you just win. Yeah. All right. So if you get timed out for saying this

1126
05:38:17,299 --> 05:38:25,720
word, then you know, you just win. You don't win anything. You just win. And everyone goes,

1127
05:38:25,720 --> 05:38:33,509
wow, you did it. All right. I got to think of a word that people are just going to spam

1128
05:38:33,509 --> 05:38:39,590
words and then get it immediately. And it has to be a word in the dictionary. It's not going to be

1129
05:38:39,590 --> 05:38:47,450
a made up word. So in the mod chat, I'm going to type a word, put that on the list that times

1130
05:38:47,450 --> 05:38:56,259
you out, whatever. And whoever gets actually timed out for saying it wins the game. Who the

1131
05:38:56,259 --> 05:39:05,110
fuck is going to write this? No one's going to write that word. There's no way that's literally

1132
05:39:05,110 --> 05:39:46,700
not fucking going to happen. Tell me if somebody wins. Why would it be Peter Griffin? Wait,

1133
05:39:46,700 --> 05:40:05,990
we won't see it because it'll just get blocked. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I mean. Your chat is just

1134
05:40:05,990 --> 05:40:16,139
going to look like bots. I'll give you some hints because there's no you have to say every word in

1135
05:40:16,139 --> 05:40:38,759
the dictionary. I gave you a hint. The hint is, oh, it's not enabled yet. In the meantime,

1136
05:40:38,759 --> 05:41:34,470
I'm ready to pull this out. Your master will come for you until then. You shall rest safely here.

1137
05:41:36,740 --> 05:41:41,779
Although the slumber of restoration will most certainly deprive him of his memories.

1138
05:41:42,900 --> 05:41:48,419
Please trust me when I say that I know he will arrive before you yet again.

1139
05:41:50,919 --> 05:41:57,000
If I may be so bold, what is it that you are planning to do next, Princess?

1140
05:41:57,959 --> 05:42:08,119
Does thing talk? Oh, no, it doesn't. The Master Sword. I heard it speak to me.

1141
05:42:09,659 --> 05:42:14,380
It seems that my role is unfinished. There is still something I must do.

1142
05:42:16,330 --> 05:42:20,169
I sense there is great strength in your dedication.

1143
05:42:20,729 --> 05:42:28,250
I ask of you when he returns. Can you please relay this message?

1144
05:42:29,610 --> 05:42:36,650
Tell him I know the word as there was no word words intended for him. What sound much better

1145
05:42:36,650 --> 05:42:51,619
in the tones of your than if it was a word. Don't you think? Yes. All right. Here's the hint.

1146
05:42:53,959 --> 05:43:36,549
Steam. Steam. Nobody got it. Yes. Steam. Hot. Forceful. Magnificent. Somebody got it. Somebody

1147
05:43:36,549 --> 05:43:42,860
got it. Somebody got it. Somebody got it. Who got it? Somebody got it. It was Geyser. Nice job.

1148
05:43:42,860 --> 05:43:53,259
What you just saw, you stabbed years ago. It was Joshi. Hey, Joshi. Congratulations, Joshi.

1149
05:43:54,220 --> 05:44:01,779
Princess thought to bring it here where she knew that it would be safe under my watch.

1150
05:44:03,819 --> 05:44:09,900
She continues to fight. That's a dumbass word for real. It's a hard one. You never would have

1151
05:44:09,900 --> 05:44:21,849
guessed that. Heart cascades with faith that you will return. She has a smile like the sun.

1152
05:44:23,049 --> 05:44:33,049
I will do much to feel its warmth upon me once again. Want to do another one? Okay, let's do

1153
05:44:33,049 --> 05:45:13,619
another one. Okay, I got another one. This thing only does 30 damage. Okay, so don't use it till

1154
05:45:13,619 --> 05:45:37,720
the end of the game. All right. I did this stupid thing. How do I make it so I don't throw it?

1155
05:45:37,720 --> 05:45:45,669
It doesn't break. Oh, it doesn't break. You can throw it. Really? Whoa.

1156
05:45:50,459 --> 05:45:59,689
Oh, it does that at full health, right? That's really cool. Okay. The game is on. There's a new

1157
05:45:59,689 --> 05:46:25,220
word. Good luck. I'll give you a good hint. The hint is food. Food. It's delicious. Hot. Steam.

1158
05:46:26,220 --> 05:46:42,630
Forceful. Steam. Hot. You could even call it geyser-like. Somebody got it, Fajito.

1159
05:46:42,630 --> 05:47:01,180
Nice job. That was by Daisy. Nice job, Daisy. You're now ready to test the limits of your

1160
05:47:01,180 --> 05:47:09,860
courage at the place where you reunited with the Master Sword. You're gonna wait till I leave to

1161
05:47:09,860 --> 05:47:39,060
tell me this. Very cool. So this thing never breaks. That's DLC. Okay. Well, I'll do it maybe

1162
05:47:39,060 --> 05:48:02,340
another time. All right, we'll do one more word. I'm gonna give to the mods. It runs out of charge

1163
05:48:02,340 --> 05:48:24,919
and you can't use it for 30 minutes. Okay, that's good to know. Okay, a new word. A hint for this

1164
05:48:24,919 --> 05:48:57,349
one. How do I do a hint for this one, though, given in a way? Forceful. That's true. I wonder

1165
05:48:57,349 --> 05:49:03,220
if somebody gets it without me even saying it. Wait, somebody already got it? Somebody got it.

1166
05:49:03,220 --> 05:49:18,279
Who got it? I didn't even say anything. A lot of you guys are getting fucking timed out.

1167
05:49:18,279 --> 05:49:33,909
Somebody get it? What was the word? Wait, I need to get it confirmed. Did anybody get it?

1168
05:49:35,580 --> 05:49:53,669
Oh, okay. Fast. Blade. Blade.

1169
05:50:10,810 --> 05:50:27,270
That's pretty much all I can say to you. Fast. Blade. Spin. Spin. Spin.

1170
05:50:28,389 --> 05:50:49,369
Nice. Everybody got it. That was EV sprinkle helicopter. This next one is a phrase. Oh my god,

1171
05:50:49,369 --> 05:51:03,799
I'm driving the horse off into the water. This next one's gonna be a phrase. This is four words.

1172
05:51:23,430 --> 05:51:45,270
It's four words. It has to do with what you are seeing right now. Somebody already won it? All

1173
05:51:45,270 --> 05:51:48,069
right. Well, I don't know what the hell I did here, but I'm gonna have to call the horse at

1174
05:51:48,069 --> 05:52:06,439
a different stable. Just go back to this. Just get it. Go back and get it. No one got it yet?

1175
05:52:06,439 --> 05:52:39,799
All right. Here's the hint. Well, okay. All right. You got it, but you haven't said the right exact

1176
05:52:39,799 --> 05:52:56,139
phrase yet. It's all right. I'll do it. The stream is over. It's the end of the stream.

1177
05:52:56,139 --> 05:53:13,029
Oh, somebody got it. Gabe bud. But it's not quite over. Not yet. Give me another few minutes.

1178
05:53:13,750 --> 05:53:31,290
I want to get up to the next town. A right. What was the phrase? The phrase was the stream is over.

1179
05:53:32,250 --> 05:53:51,779
I'm ending the stream in about 10 minutes. 15 minutes. So, I've got one more divine beast and

1180
05:53:51,779 --> 05:53:58,069
then calamity Ganon, right? And then a bunch of side content, obviously.

1181
05:54:00,970 --> 05:54:23,110
That was fun. You're gonna do more side quests? Yeah. Oh, yeah. How did I turn around? I'm so

1182
05:54:23,110 --> 05:54:34,409
confused. How did I turn around in a circle? Let's do the secret word game next time.

1183
05:54:35,209 --> 05:55:12,970
I gotta think of some good twist for it. Okay. What is this? Or a tower. I'll get a tower in the

1184
05:55:12,970 --> 05:55:56,790
end. I don't see a tower anywhere. Kind of weird to be all the way out here and not have a single

1185
05:55:56,790 --> 05:56:38,520
tower or anything. There's one over there. Oh, I'll get this one.

1186
05:56:45,880 --> 05:56:57,340
Sing, please. My whole family is here. Your whole family is in the room. Like even like

1187
05:56:57,340 --> 05:57:01,900
grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, your whole family's in the room.

1188
05:57:02,380 --> 05:57:16,819
Yeah. All right. Yeah. Of course. I'll sing to your whole family. Hey, everybody. Welcome to

1189
05:57:16,819 --> 05:57:23,380
the stream. See, right now, you just fucking panicked and stumbled around desperately trying

1190
05:57:23,380 --> 05:57:27,700
to grab the remote to turn me down. Because you're like, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's so

1191
05:57:27,700 --> 05:57:31,299
embarrassing that you just had to show that to your whole family. Don't ever ask me for anything

1192
05:57:31,299 --> 05:57:52,549
like that again. You watch the sky. It was annoying. I fucking hated that.

1193
05:57:55,340 --> 05:58:08,310
Look at grandma. You pissed off grandma. Oh, that's probably easier to get.

1194
05:58:37,099 --> 05:59:24,819
It's been a wacky day today. Oh, you actually got me.

1195
05:59:49,180 --> 05:59:56,279
What the hell is happening? Why is there more than one? Oh, just because there's a tree.

1196
05:59:56,919 --> 06:00:00,069
Just because there's a tree. What happened to the horse?

1197
06:00:09,610 --> 06:00:22,580
Seriously, how do I revive the horse? No, I didn't, dude. He's fine. How do I revive the horse?

1198
06:00:29,369 --> 06:00:53,959
God damn it. Will you leave me alone with this? Do a fairy revive? Do I have one of those?

1199
06:00:53,959 --> 06:01:46,009
There is a way to revive. OK, thank God. Oh, no. Carry the laser, you'll be fine.

1200
06:03:08,279 --> 06:03:14,040
Will the next stream be chill? Yes. I feel like there's too many goofy things happening today

1201
06:03:14,040 --> 06:03:39,560
for it to be a proper chill stream. Too many goofy things happened. There we are. OK.

1202
06:03:44,840 --> 06:03:50,119
Yeah, Grotto Beast, it should be shipping really soon here. I've seen people talking about it out

1203
06:03:50,119 --> 06:03:57,880
there. Keep an eye on your tracking if you have one. We're incredibly excited to see

1204
06:03:57,880 --> 06:04:04,330
what people have to say. Yeah, we'll do a real chill stream. I'm going to slow it down a little

1205
06:04:04,330 --> 06:04:09,080
bit next time. I don't know. There was something in the water tonight. I was just all over the

1206
06:04:09,080 --> 06:04:18,520
place. It was fun, though. It was really fun. I will revive Frank 2. The next time you see me

1207
06:04:18,520 --> 06:04:24,860
stream, I'm going to play this again. I'm going to try to beat Breath of the Wild over the next

1208
06:04:24,860 --> 06:04:44,090
few days. So I will see you all on Monday. Monday at 6 p.m. Happy April Fools. I didn't really do

1209
06:04:44,090 --> 06:04:50,810
very much besides make it so you can't talk that much, which, oops. No, it was fun. I had a good

1210
06:04:50,810 --> 06:04:59,990
time. Hopefully it was fun to watch because it's fun to play. Good or as bad as I am at the game,

1211
06:04:59,990 --> 06:05:11,619
that's fine. We will slow it down. I will. We'll chill out next stream, but that's going to be it.

1212
06:05:11,619 --> 06:05:25,259
See you guys on Monday. Take care of yourselves. And also, Sea Dog had a massive raid. If you're

1213
06:05:25,259 --> 06:05:42,119
still here from Connor's stream. Yeah, we'll do some proper exploring. I'm not just going to run

1214
06:05:42,119 --> 06:05:49,880
to the next Divine Beast. There's a whole area that I want to go take a look at. So we're not

1215
06:05:49,880 --> 06:05:57,959
just going to sprint through the game. I'm thinking I'll try to get it done in the next

1216
06:05:57,959 --> 06:06:03,720
two or three streams. Maybe another two or three streams of this will probably do it.

1217
06:06:03,720 --> 06:06:17,000
Like another 15 hours or so. That's probably seems like accurate amount of time. We'll see.

1218
06:06:17,000 --> 06:06:22,220
What about April 5th? Well, that was that's the Roblox birthday party.

1219
06:06:22,220 --> 06:06:47,750
And take a pause on this for a little bit. Yeah. Have a great night. Have a good rest of your

1220
06:06:47,750 --> 06:06:59,509
weekend. I'm sorry. I was a little unhinged today, but I had fun. I still can't believe

1221
06:06:59,509 --> 06:07:02,549
people could not write the for the first four hours of the stream.

1222
06:07:05,319 --> 06:07:12,310
How do you guys were super, super creative with though? I didn't even notice. I did not even

1223
06:07:12,310 --> 06:07:29,080
notice as there was a lot of th threes is that's why they were writing that. Everybody was writing

1224
06:07:29,080 --> 06:07:32,599
that. That's right. I was wondering for a second after the first like 20 minutes, it's like, oh,

1225
06:07:32,599 --> 06:07:36,919
that's a funny joke. I just never, we just never turned it off. I was like, why are people doing

1226
06:07:36,919 --> 06:07:59,349
like th three? Still like what's going on? Adapt and overcome. All right. I'll see you guys

1227
06:07:59,349 --> 06:08:09,819
a day after tomorrow. Tomorrow for some of you, but take care of yourselves. Call your mother.

1228
06:08:09,819 --> 06:08:16,520
Thanks for watching. It's a good time to stop to midnight. I don't want to go too much longer.

1229
06:08:21,259 --> 06:08:24,819
More breath of the wild. Good night.
