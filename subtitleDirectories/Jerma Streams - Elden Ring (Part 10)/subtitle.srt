1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:09,859
Hey, good afternoon. Ah, it's it's evening. Never mind. Yeah, I'm here. It's really late. Yeah, it is

2
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,220
It ain't no time like the present to play Elden Ring

3
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:26,300
Elden Ring. Yeah, I uh, we streamed yesterday

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When I say we I mean me

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,490
At the end of that stream. I said that Tuesday is what you probably could expect

6
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:35,259
but

7
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:39,020
Uh, I want I'm I want to go now. So we're doing it now

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,560
So we're very very early

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,659
Because i'm supposed to stream tomorrow, but i'm like, you know what? No streaming tonight

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,700
So it was very very early to tomorrow's stream

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,380
But this is a very late stream

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,460
starting at like 7 15

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,439
pacific

14
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,439
so I i'll tell you

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,740
I am

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,859
Makes sense if you're like, you know what dude? I don't know if I mean

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,030
I'm okay. I could probably be here for like an hour or two

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,030
That's all right. I don't okay. I don't think this is gonna be like a 10 hour stream

19
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,900
I'm just playing i'm just gonna jump in we're gonna play we're gonna hang out

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,579
Get some more progress done in the volcano manner

21
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,870
And look after four or five hours, let's figure it out. Whatever

22
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,650
You guys are all addicted. That's why you're here

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,599
Hey, well, you know

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,200
That's whatever if the game's fun and there's a bunch of people think it's fun

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,319
400,000 concurrent people still playing the game by the way

26
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,469
We're all here. So let's just hang out

27
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:54,569
Is this the guy that says Aaron?

28
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,950
well

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,859
It used to be kind of moved on from those kind of that kind of material

30
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,659
Moved on to an elden ring streamer

31
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,280
uh, so you're probably gonna get some elden ring kind of references and

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,430
I would appreciate it if those of you that are here now can say things instead of like aaron

33
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,669
You know like praise the sun and not maiden lists and you know that kind of thing

34
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,389
I changed my brand a little here

35
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,169
I would appreciate it. Nobody said like, you know, nobody said aaron anymore. We're trying to move on to other things

36
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,199
We're gonna move on to elden ring stuff

37
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,550
Aaron ring

38
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,060
All right. We're in the volcano manor. I do I really need an intro

39
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:39,500
We just I stopped streaming like less than 24 hours ago. So let's just keep going

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,099
What about doi doi doi? No, that's not that's not what we're doing anymore

41
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:52,300
please

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,259
I don't even know what that mean. I don't know how

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,219
I don't know how to do it

44
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:06,780
Just sit here for 20 more minutes talking about your old noises

45
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,020
You know how weird that is to think about? Oh man like

46
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,500
Those old jokes. Oh those jokes from you know years past those noises

47
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,810
They're not they're not even jokes, right? Like a lot of my old material

48
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,069
sound effects

49
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,650
the sound effects

50
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,889
Oh that classic germa 985 joke

51
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,449
Oh germa 985 was is a comedian. Yeah classic comedian

52
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,849
What's some of his material?

53
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:40,250
Oh, man, he's got this amazing routine

54
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,810
Where he sits there and are you ready? It's it's insane. He sit so he's sitting there and he goes

55
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,469
Yeah

56
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:55,419
Yeah, that's it. Does he do anything else?

57
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,500
Well, I mean his old stuff was like it's I mean, it's all right, but he did a dollhouse

58
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:06,740
Uh, he just did the dollhouse. He's got baseball coming up. But um, yeah, he used to make like noises

59
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,569
All right, man

60
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:14,969
So you're saying you're saying I should start watching the material from like 2017 and onward

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Nah, maybe a little bit later

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,259
Maybe like 2018 2019 is when he stopped doing noises for content, but he still does it

63
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,600
Anyways, I like those noises and i'm gonna stick to them

64
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:42,120
Where we were we were here. Those noises were from like a month ago

65
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,480
You watch from spi nest onwards, right? Yeah

66
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,220
You do yoga. I can't do yoga. I can't my body physically can't move that way

67
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,420
You should respect the character. This character has been incredible

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Respect the character

69
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:07,899
Respect the character. This character is amazing

70
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,750
All right. So last thing we did

71
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,709
All right. So last thing we did we we uh killed the boss that was in this room

72
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,310
I think there's a way I can go over here. Maybe

73
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,089
What is this? This is really late. Yeah, this is late night stream

74
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:31,879
I'm doing a late night at least maybe I don't know after like three or four hours

75
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,879
I just want to play and i'm not gonna play without you

76
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,100
Unless I do limb grave and i'm not doing limb grave another day

77
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,079
um

78
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:47,800
You know, I thought about oh man, like maybe i'll just go tomorrow and i'll do limb grave again today on my own on another guy

79
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,600
No

80
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,720
I stepped on this before the stream started so I think no it's here

81
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,000
Sorry played without you for 10 seconds before the stream started. Sorry. Sorry about that

82
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,889
We need a me strong stream

83
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,449
Maybe all right. Let's go. I this game. I love it. Let's go

84
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:25,060
a lot of candles

85
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,839
You know a thing next to the piano

86
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,519
the piano like object

87
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,699
Was that a good villain here? I just calmed it back

88
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:53,829
nothing over here

89
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,509
Resident sleeper. It's been the streamers been off for fucking five minutes

90
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,319
You know what? That's so funny. Like

91
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,019
You guys don't have any idea how much power you really hold

92
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:16,459
Like oh i'm just i'm just a i'm just a random viewer in a sea of people you have you hold a lot of power over

93
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,060
The people that are streaming

94
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,040
I'm telling you right now when a streamer looks over and sees resident sleeper

95
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,519
They have an internal panic attack

96
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:30,379
But they're like what's happening this person? Why is this person think my stream sucks? My stream's boring. Why what happened?

97
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,620
I need to do something. I gotta do something now. I gotta wake that person up. I gotta make like a joke

98
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:45,300
I gotta do something you hold a lot of power, but i'm gonna choose to ignore you. All right

99
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
This is what what is this like wacky?

100
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,819
Twisting hallway thing. Am I just walking in circles? There's nothing here

101
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,750
How can there be no items here?

102
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,790
None at all zero across this there's got to be a secret wall, right?

103
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,779
You gotta go back to your old your old material man

104
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,680
Ooh

105
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,279
All right, I can go that way. Yeah, dude. Your old material was way better

106
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,189
Wasn't there another way I could go? Hold on

107
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:21,189
Can I seriously isn't nothing here?

108
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:24,839
That feels impossible. But whatever

109
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,990
These are really romantic candles

110
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:35,820
No, it probably stinks up here

111
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,259
Uh, yeah, boss. I filled the room with the red candles like you wanted

112
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,980
gerry

113
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,799
You fucking idiot

114
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:51,159
Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle from yankee candle and put it in every room

115
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,879
We have to we're gonna have to fucking open the windows and not come back here for like a week

116
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,870
Which by the way, that's one of the most powerful. That's one of the most powerful of all the candles and I hate them

117
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,000
I I swear to god I can tell

118
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,240
I can tell when a neighbor lights one of those candles

119
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,429
It drives me crazy

120
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:21,029
Is that like cinnamon? It's like the fall cinnamon cider apple one. It's just like no

121
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,110
Yeah, I like it for like a second, but

122
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,750
I don't want to fill my whole neighborhood with that

123
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,340
wait

124
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,500
Take it to jump in the lava

125
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,600
What's my death count out right now?

126
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,379
What is it? I I don't what is it even at?

127
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,149
My under 500 deaths. I didn't even say it went too fast

128
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,309
How many deaths are there?

129
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:55,059
I don't have 700 deaths. No, I don't

130
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,169
493

131
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,779
Does anybody

132
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,700
Know how many times I died in securo or dark soul 3? All right, well i'm going down here

133
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:19,000
In here, I think I I don't think I died more than like 150 times in dark souls 3. It was like 200

134
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,779
Have I been in here?

135
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,779
Well shit, I guess not

136
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,009
Okay. Well

137
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:40,230
Go on here. How many was securo?

138
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,750
What the what the fuck? I was over there. Shit. All right, never mind

139
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,289
All right. I'm going back up. I'm going I walked in a circle

140
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:52,009
I locked in I literally walked in a circle

141
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,340
242

142
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,059
I can't well, here's the thing. This game is also like five times as long as all the souls games

143
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:14,549
So I that makes sense

144
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,590
Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's go up that way. There's nothing over there. I guess I can drop

145
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,590
I don't know why you would want to drop down there

146
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,970
That's a that's a big run

147
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,970
So I did look up

148
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,690
Yeah. Yeah, he's using a guide. No, this is beautiful though

149
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,990
I love that

150
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,669
You guys have just put on youtube videos of like that weird gooey lava just like falling down and somebody like hitting it with a stick

151
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,440
I want to do that

152
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,879
Like I wonder like where you do that like I want those videos of the people like oh and here's you take a look

153
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,960
And it's like really slow moving gooey like almost like cookie batter

154
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,620
and they like knock it with a stick and it's like goopy and it like breaks up and

155
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,190
I would do that for like three or four hours and that would be a vacation like that

156
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,509
That's what I wanted to do on vacation

157
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,679
I wouldn't care about anything else

158
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,840
You'd fall in i'm not gonna I wouldn't fall in the lava. It moves at like 0.2 miles per hour

159
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,090
I'm not gonna fall in the lava

160
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:31,370
Why would that happen?

161
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,090
Yes, you would no, I would not fall in the lava. Why do you guys think okay?

162
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,269
Why do you guys think that I like need to ride a bicycle with training wheels on it still?

163
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:47,210
You know, but like no, I see how so I was riding my bike yesterday

164
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,529
Oh, yeah, he has to have training wheels on he's he's he's brainless

165
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,409
No, I could ride a bike normally. I i'm not gonna fall into lava

166
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,850
I'm not what am I just gonna sit there and stare at it and just like lean forward until I face first like put

167
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,450
My face in the cake

168
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,450
That's what are you talking about?

169
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:12,779
Yeah, i'm gonna ride on my training wheels tricycle just into the lava and fall forward

170
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:23,100
This is so cool

171
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,909
I would go on vacation here

172
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:36,740
That would be the ultimate fall joke. I would wouldn't that would be awful

173
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,679
Do they make like

174
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,159
They gotta make like candy that's like this, right?

175
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,149
Is it like a and I don't want the lava candy that's like cinnamon red cinnamon apple bullshit

176
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:59,029
Okay, let me be very clear about that. They make like lava candy and it's red cinnamon bullshit

177
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,059
Why does everything no, I don't all right. This looks I don't like this

178
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:12,659
This looks like a boss place

179
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,710
Cinnamon's good

180
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,190
I you know, I have not jumped onto the cinnamon train. I'm sorry

181
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:26,309
I really kind of don't like it. It just overpowers everything that it touches

182
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,830
Oh, you want a latte? Yeah, sure. I'll take it. No, no, no, please

183
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,110
Can I just only taste cinnamon put like sprinkle one little ounce of oh my god

184
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:39,769
If you get anything with cinnamon on it, it's just a cinnamon thing. It doesn't taste like the thing you have

185
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,570
All right. Stop fucking complaining. Stop talking to me

186
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:49,830
I don't want to fight this fucking thing because like it is a million health

187
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,519
Will it burn?

188
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,549
I gotta put on fire resist

189
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:02,740
What the fuck cinnamon bros no cinnamon is

190
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,409
It's oh, it's too much

191
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:11,690
I appreciate cinnamons, you know that what what it's doing. I don't what i'm why am I acting like cinnamon is

192
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,580
like alive

193
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,899
I appreciate what cinnamon's going for but i'm not really into it that much like what are you talking about?

194
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,259
I get out of my way. I'm going to the building

195
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:31,509
Okay, you go through walls fix your fucking broken game

196
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:38,059
It's been a problem for a decade fix it people can shoot hit through walls fix your broken game

197
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:48,169
Okay, so this was where is this?

198
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:53,899
What was that?

199
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:59,370
It was it was you what the fuck I was terrified

200
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,679
Because the capcom rant no

201
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,679
All right. So this is

202
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,700
It's a bonfire up here, right?

203
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:22,220
Isn't there because that's a shortcut to isn't there a bonfire like right here?

204
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:35,779
He's god but you're not like cinnamon rolls. I just I it's too much for me. It's just like it's too much

205
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,809
Anytime I have cinnamon, I always have the same like

206
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:49,190
Reaction to it. All right, so this is where that was

207
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,059
so

208
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,620
Okay

209
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,779
We go from here. I just want to get this burn in my brain. All right, so from this bonfire we go up

210
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580
shortcut achieved

211
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,750
You have children taste child taste

212
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,559
Wait, go back down. He has one taste bud

213
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,859
some of you like some of you cinnamon andes seriously are like

214
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,390
Really? Like you don't care that much about cinnamon, right?

215
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:34,549
Okay

216
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:45,369
That's where it is i've been hearing this for the last like three in-game hours

217
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:53,819
What is it? Oh somber spinning stone. I can probably make that just run across right?

218
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,039
I have you what?

219
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,039
flabbergasted you're using cinnamon as a bit

220
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,380
don't

221
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,380
I don't like cinnamon. So that is this is like a like a comedy routine

222
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,619
Okay, wait a minute

223
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:29,019
If I had a microphone in my hand and there was a slight echo

224
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,740
I guess you I guess that play that whole okay

225
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,059
Play that whole thing back the entire thing that I said about like cinnamons and like red apple and stuff

226
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,059
Add a little bit of an echo and like a little bit of a mic effect and an audience laughing every like

227
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,839
10 to 15 seconds

228
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,200
If it probably would be like a comedy routine

229
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,460
Oh god

230
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,200
Still don't understand why the cinnamon challenge was

231
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,759
Even

232
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,089
Yeah, I forgot about that people would just like take a bunch of cinnamon and go like

233
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,650
Yeah, like spit it out. I forgot about that

234
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,289
That was a thing for a long time

235
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:28,329
I don't want this guy's gonna kill me

236
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,329
I'm sorry that I mentioned the candles

237
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:33,049
I was observing it too

238
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:43,579
please next joke

239
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:47,990
You go to a stand-up routine the whole like

240
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,470
10 minute open mic night is the guy just talking about like red cinnamon

241
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,630
Cinnamon red cinnamon. Yeah, it's gross. Remember the cinnamon videos people used to eat cinnamon. Yes, it sucks by the way

242
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,029
All right, that's my time. I'll see you guys later

243
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:14,119
I'm gonna look out for the lava. Holy fucking shit this lava here

244
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:20,460
I didn't even see it

245
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,660
What the fuck dude?

246
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,140
Thank you

247
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,140
No, seriously like thanks man. Like I

00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:34,440
What the fuck it's it is everywhere it's like everywhere

249
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
All right. Well, that was cool. I got a uh

250
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,430
somber

251
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,390
You know

252
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:53,210
Just wait, can I keep going?

253
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,210
You're inside of a volcano right now

254
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,859
All right. If i'm from software i'm putting

255
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:17,339
How come you don't take fire damage? Where did this guy even come from?

256
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,859
Cinnamon is great 78 percent

257
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,829
Am I really that people really that in the uh,

258
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:34,869
You guys like cinnamon that much?

259
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,950
All right, let me go this way I could walk around the other way, which I think I might

260
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:56,220
Yes. Yes cinnamon slaps

261
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Okay, I want you to do me a favor

262
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,670
uh

263
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,670
Name me something that cinnamon

264
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,069
Is good on

265
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,829
That's not a pie

266
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,150
Or uh, like a some kind of like dessert

267
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:19,589
Like what else where where else can you use cinnamon besides like a fucking like the crust of a pie?

268
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:27,180
Cinnamon toast crunch does not count. That's like cinnamon sugar bullshit. That's not real cinnamon

269
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:34,660
Yeah, yeah, that's that is like not even close to being real cinnamon

270
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:37,670
It's like sugar

271
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,519
Somebody in a flavor lab came up with that. That's not cinnamon

272
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:52,650
apple sauce

273
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,940
Apple sauce drunk you drunk

274
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:06,920
on eggnog

275
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
All right. Look, I gotta pay attention to the fucking game

276
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,940
This is where I want to be

277
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,980
Yes, okay

278
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,259
I spent like two hours yesterday just talking and like walking in circles. I gotta like progress through

279
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,890
elderberry ring

280
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:41,240
Probably should sit at the bonfire though. I love cinnamon apple sauce

281
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:51,079
I mean, I guess it's like, okay

282
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,819
So I would put it pretty low on like the

283
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,779
kind of spices list

284
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,190
All right, that one has it right

285
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,220
Why would I jump to it? What a spices tier list

286
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:17,210
I don't think one exists

287
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:23,670
All right. Let me check down here first

288
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,049
what about

289
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:28,329
Apple jacks or apple jacks is it's all this like cinnamon

290
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,099
It's cinnamon sugar fake cinnamon shit. It's not actual cinnamon

291
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,069
You know what they do?

292
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:43,910
They put like one they put like one little dash of cinnamon and then like five tablespoons of sugar and they mix it up

293
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,450
I think i've been over here already

294
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,819
Let me go back up. Yeah, I was

295
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:00,950
You're moving goal posts that's what that's what I do here

296
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,660
Opium cinnamon sugar isn't actually cinnamon

297
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:15,700
Is whipped cream milk?

298
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,140
Does that argument make any sense? Somebody will I don't know maybe

299
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:29,400
No, it's not it's not milk. It's it has milk in it. It's made from milk, but it's not just milk

300
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,940
Cinnamon just cinnamon is gross

301
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,170
I win

302
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:41,980
It's one place that I would agree with you

303
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,539
and that is

304
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:46,539
taco bell cinnamon twisties

305
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
That is the one spot. I will agree with you

306
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,609
but again

307
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:57,450
Not really cinnamon is it it's like one percent cinnamon

308
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,839
I've been down here, right?

309
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,039
Where does that?

310
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,980
Oh, okay. Okay. So this is that this ladder goes. Wait a minute

311
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:14,680
I've not been here yet. Have I?

312
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
No, I haven't. All right. Hold on. Where's the elevator go?

313
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,160
Add I did there's no ad for taco bell that taco bell is like the best fast food place

314
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,380
best

315
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,099
It goes it does go over mcdonald's for me

316
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,109
It is better than mcdonald's

317
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,859
Because it has the single best menu item

318
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,180
Any restaurant in the world and i'm not talking fast, but I mean restaurant like you go to fight the best single

319
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:59,109
Restaurant item on earth. I would eat a cheesy godita crunch over filet mignon and be like, yeah, that was better

320
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:02,099
Just a single best menu item in the world

321
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Kind of spitting facts

322
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,339
Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Is this an illusionary wall?

323
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,559
Dude kind of spitting facts right now

324
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,740
Where's he going? I just got an elevator. I'm trying to see where it is

325
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,240
Wait, I already went in that elevator. I'm very distracted

326
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,480
Okay, I am

327
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,559
All right. I'm extraordinarily distracted

328
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:51,430
Zero progress. It's been 30 fucking minutes. I know but I just like whatever

329
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:57,450
I told you i'm an elden ring streamer now and that means this is like I got to drag the content out

330
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,930
Fuck all right. I'm doing progress now. No more talking about anything that doesn't all right. Hold on

331
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,890
I want I want to save all these crunchies, but i'll use them

332
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,920
1000 there we go. I stubble I need to shave tonight probably

333
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:22,809
All right. I have 20 endurance

334
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,450
I am at everywhere. I want to be

335
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,730
Another question is do I keep leveling up vigor?

336
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,140
Or do I put some more points in mind get mine to like 25?

337
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:42,900
I'm gonna say mine mine and then maybe go back to an int

338
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:50,839
I'll get mine to 25. I feel like I do really need mana. All right, here we go time for progress

339
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,660
You should pretend you're let's playing, you know how many times i've made that joke

340
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,029
I've done the like i'm making a let's play

341
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:08,599
After the age of twitch, right? I don't you guys remember but people would do let's plays

342
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,619
They probably still do

343
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:15,299
Where it would the video would be 10 to 15 minutes long and then there'd be like another video

344
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:21,380
Good luck making one of those kinds of youtube playlists with this game

345
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,940
You're gonna have like 800 videos

346
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:32,230
This is gonna be something crazy get to the uh, the vigor soft cap. It's 50

347
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,349
Yeah, after after mine 25 i'll get there

348
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,819
All right. So here we go. Let's go. Here we go. This is the way i'm going

349
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,019
Game progress i'm ready

350
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,799
Going this way. We're gonna progress not going down any weird ladders

351
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,900
Oh, but I was gonna I looked up, uh, I didn't look up any explorers or anything

352
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,420
but I wanted to see the level kind of range for uh mount delmer

353
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,019
And it's the thing that I just looked up level range mount gelmer

354
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:07,559
And it says 80 to 100

355
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,920
so

356
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,279
I think i'm all right. I'm right at the kind of top end of uh of being like leveled for this area. So

357
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,500
What is this place called? It's not gelmer

358
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,609
Gilmer what's this place called?

359
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:28,329
What is this place called?

360
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:31,509
mount gilmore

361
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:36,150
Helman mount gilmore. It's gelmer. That's what I said. I said gelmer

362
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,559
What are you talking about? That's exactly what I just said gelmer

363
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,099
What is it? Is it like is it like gel near?

364
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:52,869
How many times do you swing this around the circle, dude?

365
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:55,430
All right, fine. Fuck it

366
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,349

367
00:30:57,349 --> 00:31:08,890
That move is seriously so bad. I don't know why I have it in my loadout

368
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,130
Gelmer

369
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:24,869

Oh, these guys are so poisoned

390
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,549

um

395
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,539
I don't know. I just kind of feel like playing feel like just hanging out

396
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:54,089
I really want to play

397
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:58,089
and I the last week so over the last week it has like kind of

398
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,650
kind of medical problems

399
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,130
I haven't really been playing that much. I didn't want to play off stream content that I haven't seen yet

400
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,130
so

401
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,289
Now that i'm like, i'm like I can stream i'm like good to go for a little bit. I think

402
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:16,570
As I want to play like I want to play elden ring and I don't want to play off stream unless i've already seen it

403
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,860
All right. Well, this is one of those things back here

404
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:29,750
I feel like i've not been paying attention to the amount of these keys that I still have

405
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,639
I've just been using them

406
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:45,500
Okay, I got a lot of 11 heads up. You're almost at the cutoff for the assassination missions. Thank you backseater

407
00:34:46,219 --> 00:35:11,400
I actually appreciate it. How far down does this go?

408
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:21,559
Somebody's casting a spell at me

409
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,559
Oh fuck don't move. Don't move go this way

410
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:52,760
Oh, why did he have range and I didn't how do you get over there? How do you get up there?

411
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:03,460
Inaccurate what is it ledge? Is there a ledge?

412
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,539
All right. Yeah

413
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:19,349
I don't you can't jump on that

414
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:29,340
Double that right there. I don't think you can no you can't jump on that. Maybe there's an elevator that goes up

415
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:49,670
I love this. Is this safe to fall down? Oh fuck. I probably messed that up

416
00:36:50,789 --> 00:37:00,010
I don't know. Who's the who's your your favorite life?

417
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:22,019
All right, so this is down here it's the wrong game is it though

418
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,260
another one of these

419
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
Right. How many how many of these do I have?

420
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:45,429
When I have over one of these already, where is it? Uh-huh. I have two of these

421
00:37:45,750 --> 00:38:00,949
I gotta feed these to the dung eater before I go up. I'm gonna go over here. I never want to hear you say

422
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:08,940
waifu again

423
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,099
Why do I have to play by a certain set of rules though?

424
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:13,820
Right, like you a bunch of you guys say that shit a lot

425
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:16,460
But I can't make a reference to it, right?

426
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,579
Like why do you get to play by a different set of rules that I do?

427
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:26,489
I feel like that painting's gonna be as alive royal knights resolve

428
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,800
Because you're a grown adult

429
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,139
Yeah, but I you I you guys make references to this shit like what I

430
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,710
And to be very fair, my my response was a very joke response. Okay

431
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:54,150
Because you're 36

432
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,679
Oh

433
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,570
Hey

434
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:16,679
Wait, is this that door that's locked? This is the manor. What is patch is doing here?

435
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,579
Okay

436
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,019
He's such a dick

437
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:45,320
Are you surprised that I belong to the volcano manor?

438
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,519
I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable two fingers

439
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,380
I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade not to mention

440
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,260
Tanith has always made me curious

441
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,059
I think her master must really be something

442
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,780
She's pretty damn smug about it

443
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,059
Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions. She still stands proud

444
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:15,639
I've never seen a woman quite like her. I just you have a regular

445
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:18,119
Plus two short spear

446
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,269
I don't think you get to tell me how what what i'm doing here. Okay

447
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,070
You see me you see what I got?

448
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:41,019
It's grace mimic gold. Ooh, can I make that not that I really care but

449
00:40:41,659 --> 00:40:47,929
I'll own it

450
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,280
All right, bye

00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:25,880
here is your usual reward am now perhaps the time has come to tell you

510
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:33,590
of the true ruler of this manor lord oh i'm here to kill him the erd tree blessed the tarnished

511
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:40,630
with grace but it was all too meager in the face of the enormity of their task the tarnished were

512
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:47,909
forced to scavenge squabbling for crumbs like the shard bearers vying for power in the wake of the

513
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:57,590
shattering our lord indignant has refused to scurry about fighting over what miserly scraps

514
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:05,190
they allow us if the earth tree and indeed the very gods would debase us so then we are willing

515
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:14,340
to raise the banner of resistance even if it means heresy we at the volcano manor under lord have

516
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:22,340
sworn no rest until i kill him if you follow this heroic path one day the lord will see

517
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:28,420
are you gonna be able just to backstab him visits with our champions are always a spectacle it

585
01:11:02,569 --> 01:11:09,420

588
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:56,390
it is it's faith and sorcery not happening cool though so faith and sorcery i always thought you

589
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:00,789
had to pick one but i guess when you get later in the game you can kind of combine them that's

590
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:23,369
kind of cool you still a lot all right so let's talk to patches who's that what is this brave

630
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:28,420

636
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:44,460
in the pitch black of night it entered the room next to this one and never came out

637
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:53,579
if i'm not mistaken it took the form of a serpent just like me does the volcano

638
01:20:53,579 --> 01:21:01,100
manor hides in secret that lady tannis has kept who's the snake i realize that i shouldn't impose

639
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:09,460
but if you discover anything who's the snake would you please share other of the oh i already saw it

640
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:24,840
was a secret after all lady tannis has deceived me was i not the grace of a king oh you're good

643
01:21:54,359 --> 01:22:03,779

645
01:22:17,659 --> 01:22:26,180
call her mother once again this time from the bottom of my heart you know that's really

646
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:35,939
inaccurate but the teller stork comes and brings us in a little cradle i'm i feel like i should

647
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:46,869
tell her i want to know how i was born and met lady tannis one day i hope to call her mother

648

650
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:10,069
something was wrong the signs were clear enough

651
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:19,960
zarias has placed her trust in you the reason i must tell you that some things are better left

652
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:26,920
unknown besides no one should be blamed for why there's somebody why the monsters involved

653
01:23:28,119 --> 01:23:35,159
we are resisting the ways of the urge tree itself what matters one's lineage in such a crisis

654
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:38,760
your drywall was trying to kill me earlier so like i wanted you to explain that

655
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:48,300
shit has placed her trust in you but some things are better left unknown besides no one should

656
01:23:48,300 --> 01:24:30,140
okay you don't go fucking near her by the way okay where'd you go oh i thought there was her

657
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:37,319
lying on the ground all right it's time to it's time to watch the credits and open up the next

661
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:28,600
where'd she go if you followed him okay where i haven't seen zarias anywhere why and she has

662
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:34,439
no scouting duties now has she gone off in search of answers why won't she just listen

663
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:51,579
yeah may i ask you not as the man as proprietress but as his mother if she discovers the answer to

664
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:58,939
her question and it causes distress or have a drink this potion to purge that which would

665
01:25:58,939 --> 01:26:05,260
cause her pain i don't want to give her a fucking potion tonic of forgetfulness yes my wish is a

666
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:11,420
grave disrespect to her no different than the earth tree's imposition but i have no choice

667
01:26:12,699 --> 01:26:19,460
it must be done my wish is a great i've noticed okay so hold on a minute you're telling me that

668
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:26,220
i'm supposed to give her this drink that is going to make her like do what forgetfulness

669
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:38,500
let me see what that says where is it tonic in a small brass bowl vanish vanishes distress

670
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:45,380
and bitter memories a gift bestowed by ryckhard sworn to blasphemy to lady tenneth who unfortunately

671
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:53,029
had no use for it my lord there could be no greater distress than to forget you small

672
01:26:53,029 --> 01:26:58,710
flask received from perceptor selvis containing a cloudy tonic of bluish black find nepheli and

673
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:06,949
ensure she drinks it all right make sure i don't like fucking mix these up i also have like a bunch

674
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:13,770
of perfume like potion bottles i i need like a little bit of a management system here just chug

675
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:26,760
both there's only one of these what okay so i need to find where she went which is not very much info

676
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:34,840
i'm imagining it's probably somewhere here all right it's got to be somewhere in the manner

677
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:40,920
right if you follow the hip cannot there's no info on where she would be is there like a clue left

678
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:48,039
in the room or something you want directions do you want to find it yourself um i'm gonna imagine

679
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:56,039
it's probably in the walls either that or it's further in the zone that i haven't been yet

680
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:05,829
i'm gonna okay tell me if i'm on the right spot am i on the right path going in like she's in the

681
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:20,010
in here somewhere in the secret wall no very cold okay somewhere in the dungeon overall okay

682
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:32,220
all right uh we'll beep as you get closer he's in the lava area you guys can start beeping

683
01:28:33,979 --> 01:28:41,689
all right now my question to you all is this it was the concern that i know do you got to do this

684
01:28:41,689 --> 01:28:49,560
first because you might lose access to it after doing the boss here am i safe to do the boss now

685
01:28:50,279 --> 01:29:05,109
is that okay am i safe to continue to progress i'm gonna go i have to finish the assassin missions

686
01:29:05,829 --> 01:29:19,579
but dude i've i hadn't even been up here before that's like far away you can do the boss you can

687
01:29:19,579 --> 01:29:25,899
come back to the boss later just do the boss it's fine especially for no kidding the boss after the

688
01:29:25,899 --> 01:29:32,250
snake girl you don't need the assassination missions okay so i'll let me try to find her

689
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:39,260
i'm very intrigued so people were talking about how she's in the lava area i'll try to find it

690
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:52,979
you must defeat the assassins master bruce yeah you must defeat the assassins master bruce

gonna throw auto on stream sorry me strong will take care of it yeah all of my duties all the

765
01:50:20,409 --> 01:50:35,880
things i say are just gonna go on to me strong i have to start killing these things why are you

766
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:41,399
procrastinating an elden ring i feel like that's a huge part of the game is to kind of wander around

767
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:53,029
and come back and do stuff way later all right i need i need to kill a few things where can i go

768
01:50:53,029 --> 01:51:02,890
to just kill a bunch of random shit i'm gonna go to where that boss is um where i was right from the

769
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:07,369
church from the church right what's the bonfire to get to where i was looking i was like oh look

770
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:20,439
at that big open door i think it's here the more you rush the more the less elden ring content

771
01:51:20,439 --> 01:51:30,170
we're gonna get oh that's literally where i was just fucking standing jeremy i was just standing

772
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:52,279
there i was standing there i need the fucking goddamn vitamins today all right this is this

773
01:51:52,279 --> 01:52:00,020
is this is correct yes it is all right so now i want to go over here and i want to go not that

774
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:06,359
way i want to go the other way there's a place that i wanted to go and i don't remember where the

775
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:11,560
where the fuck it is it's up up there i don't know dude i have no idea

776
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:27,159
did you find the illusory toilet is that where you you sit down to take a shit and when you shit

777
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:31,720
you actually like squeeze out your shit the toilet goes away and you shit on the floor

778
01:52:32,359 --> 01:52:42,949
what would that mean it's all right i i need to really fucking figure out where i'm going here

779
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:49,609
this area is just my brain is having so much trouble with this zone because it's like the

780
01:52:55,460 --> 01:53:03,140
yes somebody did say that yes they did i read that i read it somebody said it all right give

781
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:06,500
me a hand here because like i've honestly like we've been talking about like illusory toilets i

782
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:10,840
don't i what's what about where am i going i remember i looked at it and i was like i need

783
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:17,750
to go that way and i just kind of i forgot where i was going where was it it was like up there i

784
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:32,250
think was the temple because i had to be like up higher i didn't know how so much verticality in

785
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:37,369
this game my brain it's like the map doesn't show like verticality so it's just like is that one

786
01:53:37,369 --> 01:53:48,039
higher are we up are we down and then it's from here out yeah and then it's to the left of here

787
01:53:48,039 --> 01:53:56,859
right no it's up and then off the balcony so much fucking verticality this is like this is like

788
01:53:56,859 --> 01:54:05,579
two thousand feet up and down like from from each of these four bonfires it's like it's like four

789
01:54:05,579 --> 01:54:16,840
thousand feet up and down below and up above sea level because then there's this way which leads

790
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:25,779
to up here and then did i want to go i want to go up from here right because then the manor is

791
01:54:25,779 --> 01:54:34,649
behind me i think this is correct but this place is fucking 10 000 feet below and above sea level

792
01:54:35,689 --> 01:54:51,350
like it's huge it's a goddamn mountain okay it's a mountain and then oh fucking god damn it i have

793
01:54:51,350 --> 01:55:02,789
no idea where i'm going take to go at the shortcut elevator what's he trying to do i actually

794
01:55:02,789 --> 01:55:08,949
don't i don't know like i i'm trying to go to like with that area where i could i've looked over and

795
01:55:08,949 --> 01:55:16,619
i'm just gonna go watch the vod and go see where the fuck i was i just i can't put it into long

796
01:55:16,619 --> 01:55:21,850
term memory there's so many there's so many like levels to this mountain you were going the right

797
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:40,229
way can i really not go to the map because these fucking slugs are in front of me if all the slugs

798
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:46,329
have all right let me let me let me play out a scenario this is fucking confusing all right so

799
01:55:46,329 --> 01:55:53,449
let me play a scenario out go to the elevator that is next to the not the elevator where the

800
01:55:53,449 --> 01:56:06,949
boss was that second elevator and then go from there right i think that's right you had too

801
01:56:06,949 --> 01:56:20,649
many flintstone gummies okay yeah so it's like out here and then in this elevator and then out that

802
01:56:20,649 --> 01:56:37,029
way and go all the way up i'm painting it in my head right now okay then we go this way nice try

803
01:56:40,250 --> 01:57:08,149
and then out here i think yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then over here and then okay

804
01:57:08,149 --> 01:57:18,979
all right but this is where i want it this is yeah yeah yeah yeah yep and up yeah it's so hard to

805
01:57:18,979 --> 01:57:32,420
find this stuff i said they came in that they came back like an hour and a half later and i

806
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:38,020
was still in this room i just i did a bunch of like side quests shit okay i did a bunch of side

807
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:46,180
missions i i did like the whole serpent girl quest line i did the assassination mission i've been

808
01:57:46,180 --> 01:58:02,039
doing things i've been keeping myself busy yeah because then i went down here and i remember

809
01:58:02,039 --> 01:58:07,930
specifically being like how the fuck do i get back here me strong gonna handle that one i me

810
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:14,899
strong's gonna handle that one yep it was so long ago that i didn't put this into long-term

811
01:58:14,899 --> 01:58:24,539
memory it's so funny that i keep saying me strong is gonna handle this but i don't think me strong

812
01:58:24,539 --> 01:58:33,770
is gonna be able to like get out of limb grave me strong is gonna walk off a cliff and limb grave

813

like 50 times and i'm gonna have to turn the stream off i get your step will the will the me

814
01:58:51,930 --> 01:58:58,569
strong jokes last as long as the 50 hours it's gonna take for this character um i am not gonna

815
01:58:58,569 --> 01:59:06,710
play through the entire game as that character so don't worry that will be maybe one afternoon

842
02:08:02,819 --> 02:08:20,229
this a gimmick fight where is it serpent hunter weapon that serves as both great sword and spear

843
02:08:21,449 --> 02:08:27,369
thought to have been used to hunt an immortal great serpent in the distant past it manifests

844
02:08:27,369 --> 02:08:34,409
a long blade of light when facing such a creature okay when their master's heroic aspirations

845
02:08:34,409 --> 02:08:39,289
degenerate into mere greed his men search for weapon with which they might halt their lord

846
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:45,130
great serpent hunt perform a powerful forward lunge and follow up with an upward thrust via

847
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:50,649
additional input when fighting a great serpent a long blade of light will appear revealing the

848
02:08:50,649 --> 02:08:59,189
armament's true power so should i take off should i try to get to medium load or i don't

849

867
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:08,700
that was really cool it was a gimmick fight but it was a fun gimmick fight although that's probably

868
02:17:08,700 --> 02:17:12,540
phase one and phase two he's gonna come out of the head and he's gonna be like tarnish tarnish

869
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:16,299
tarnish tarnish and then it's like uh here comes the real fight and it's gonna be horrible

02:17:17,100 --> 02:18:14,680
oh very well why does this cut to that it's gonna be fucking hell do i still have to use the gimmick

877
02:20:59,639 --> 02:21:15,139

878
02:21:15,139 --> 02:21:20,440
minute wait a minute okay all right all right i get it i get okay all right wait a minute

881
02:25:32,309 --> 02:26:54,409

882
02:26:54,969 --> 02:27:04,010
trying to run away from the skull move seems very very hard i there's probably a way to

883
02:27:04,010 --> 02:27:18,440
to get away from it i wonder what's the best way to get away from that just run i wonder if i just

884
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:33,719
do a full sprint you need to try to stun lock his entire second phase well let's just hope i can

885
02:27:33,719 --> 02:28:09,819
get to the second phase again oh you're gonna jump over that shit i don't know i'm too greedy

886
02:28:10,540 --> 02:29:04,340
not locked on that's bad news oh i don't want that on me for this shit zombie fuck i'm poisoned

887
02:29:04,340 --> 02:30:20,649
fuck fuck go get him boys what is that he's already doing this fucking move he's already doing it

888
02:30:21,209 --> 02:31:24,889
he hits the ground shit all right now run whose item whose fucking costume is this

889
02:31:35,750 --> 02:32:15,879
hey fuck off oh shit oh sorry should i jump are you supposed to get away from that a jump

890
02:32:15,879 --> 02:32:26,069
i don't i don't understand that move when he comes you can't dodge it you have to jump over it well

891
02:32:26,069 --> 02:32:34,149
can you just you can you just can i just out run it if i just run this motherfucker i swear to god

892
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:41,239
i feel like i've dodged it pretty well the last few times it just still hits you with it

893
02:32:42,809 --> 02:32:48,659
dodged later it's fucking slow ass motherfucker i swear to god

894
02:32:49,860 --> 02:33:04,360
greedy that's very very that was very greedy um let me try to outrun it if i just sprint i wonder

895
02:33:04,360 --> 02:34:08,809
if it works come on do something really what get away from the fucking poison please

896
02:34:09,930 --> 02:34:37,979
i'm gonna try to outrun that move i'm just gonna run if he still hits me then it's your fault

897
02:34:37,979 --> 02:35:57,180
because you told me to do it oh come on do it again again again again again oh

898
02:36:22,170 --> 02:37:10,840
where the fuck am i oh shit he changes fucking combo up chug chug chug chug chug chug damn

899
02:37:15,829 --> 02:37:27,590
that was crazy so honestly the he's not dead all right the strategy there honestly was just to

900
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:45,370
just to eat the flame skulls and just try to dodge them don't run am all right cool also

901
02:37:45,370 --> 02:37:55,590
you just got to go aggressive uh the chatter was right i've just taken too much time to try to just

902
02:37:55,590 --> 02:37:59,909
wait for him to do something just get in there and just have mana potions and l2 l2 and just

903
02:37:59,909 --> 02:38:06,170
unlock the fuck out of them just keep hitting them over and over again that was cool fight

904
02:38:06,969 --> 02:38:24,790
it was very cool 130 000 that's a lot yeah all right so uh let me rest here i said i want a 25

905
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:43,059
mind right i wonder what you get for this for this remembrance reload the boss area

906
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:58,659
he's level 106 reload this area go back to volcano matter and income all right well

907
02:38:58,659 --> 02:39:18,100
hold on let me let's do this first i want to see what's in here this boss weapon is amazing i

908
02:39:18,100 --> 02:39:32,579
wonder what it is is it intelligence blasphemous blade faith dex and strength another great faith

909
02:39:32,579 --> 02:39:44,729
weapon some hp is restored upon defeating an enemy raise the sacred sword of loft is set

910
02:39:44,729 --> 02:39:55,180
to blaze with blasphemous flames is steel hp that sounds insane and this is wow this is 40

911
02:39:55,180 --> 02:40:09,559
int 18 releases searing spirits that repeatedly explode oh it's the skulls try to get this that's

912
02:40:09,559 --> 02:40:17,139
i don't have any the faith though no i'm not it's not gonna be close 18 faith i'd have to put on

913
02:40:17,139 --> 02:40:29,340
a rune which would get me to 11 and then some faith talisman which would be 16

914
02:40:30,299 --> 02:40:41,780
and then a faith helmet which is would give me to 18 could respect too but is it really worth it

915
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:57,340
the spell is for the birds don't worry i wonder not for one spell not worth it the sword is cool

916
02:40:57,340 --> 02:41:05,000
but i just it's not this character that looks like it'd be cool too but i think i'm just gonna

917
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:19,770
smash it if you do anything just get the sword instead be strong would like this yeah probably

918
02:41:22,069 --> 02:41:44,020
yeah i'm gonna break it i'm gonna smash it it's it's too much faith to have to go respect for one

919
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:55,319
spell i don't think so although i do i've been neglecting sorcery really badly so like the last

920
02:41:55,319 --> 02:42:05,459
few um last few streams i i think i'm gonna have to go get a couple of good spells these are comets

921
02:42:05,459 --> 02:42:15,379
really good swift glenstone's all right for like range but i don't know actually i should

922
02:42:15,379 --> 02:42:25,959
probably upgrade the uh staff as well go kill the dragon in the ranny area yeah that's a good idea

923
02:42:25,959 --> 02:42:39,909
i'll go do that that's the best spell in the whole game okay i'll go get it but first

924
02:42:45,059 --> 02:42:53,559
literally almost everything from the volcano east needs faith all right let me see if i let me

925
02:42:53,559 --> 02:43:00,250
upgrade my uh staff i think i might be able to upgrade the boys as well well i took you for that

926
02:43:00,250 --> 02:43:09,930
matter it's all about your own smithingstone eight these are very high okay how about you can

927
02:43:09,930 --> 02:43:25,399

930
02:43:57,540 --> 02:44:15,139

02:54:40,250 --> 02:54:46,569
there which is our code even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy

976
02:54:46,569 --> 02:54:54,090
into his very flesh but any road the volcano manor is no more and yet fulfill an old promise

977
02:54:54,090 --> 02:55:09,899

979
02:55:20,149 --> 02:55:28,200
you want to kill the greater will consider this fair warning the greater will that seems that

980
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:36,139
doesn't that seems kind of like an entity you can't like go nearer you're like angry at

981
02:55:37,340 --> 02:55:41,899
essentially magic air right like the greater will is not like a person

982
02:55:41,899 --> 02:55:52,100
it's a thing it's like a it's like a concept the force hear my voice i am the recusant we

983
02:55:52,100 --> 02:55:57,139

984
02:55:57,139 --> 02:56:07,590
to the boss room because everyone said to go there those patches say you're still here

985
02:56:11,299 --> 02:56:20,229

991
02:57:22,729 --> 02:57:31,690
you guys remember the comedian galaga guy would literally just he would go on stage and he would

992
02:57:31,690 --> 02:57:37,290
just put up watermelons and everybody in the front four or five rows would be in like plastic

993
02:57:38,309 --> 02:57:49,540
and his routine was he would just go up there with a mallet and smash them that was his main

994
02:57:49,540 --> 02:57:59,700
part of his routine was just smashing fucking watermelons now that i think back what a fucking

995
02:57:59,700 --> 02:58:06,329
crazy routine and everyone would be like oh my god it got on us it was like being on like a ride

996
02:58:06,329 --> 02:58:18,069
like splash mountain or something right like what the fuck now that's entertainment you dreamed

1009
03:03:43,559 --> 03:03:52,069
volcano manner in the image of a queen increases dexterity oh long ago when ricard first set eyes

1010
03:03:52,069 --> 03:03:58,309
on tennis she was working as a dancer in a foreign land soon he made her his consort he was the only

1011
03:03:58,309 --> 03:04:05,979
human to remain by his side when he became the serpent of blasphemy it's only one dex too

1012

four or five of you dickheads so much grave glove wart you're gonna be bloated later you're gonna

1041
03:16:16,729 --> 03:16:27,180
be bloated i can't believe you didn't they didn't do anything all right so what was that sweeping

1042
03:16:27,180 --> 03:16:34,819
slash old projectile ponders a cold magic great sword then delivers a sweeping blow that launches

1043
03:16:34,819 --> 03:16:51,239
a blade-like projectile of frost and be cast repeatedly 120 000 souls too jesus i didn't

1044
03:16:51,239 --> 03:17:00,819
even get those either oh my god holy shit i'm gonna level up like two three times all right

1045
03:17:00,819 --> 03:17:07,159
there was there was another dragon here wasn't there here i remember there was a dragon that

1046
03:17:07,159 --> 03:17:18,360
hung out here wasn't there or am i crazy but that was the same one oh okay he just moves around

1047
03:17:18,840 --> 03:17:36,500
all right well let me try that spell there's your 25 mind that's that's pretty good i still have a

1048
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:42,100
lot of souls i don't know how much is it to level up oh okay okay i can do it again so now what do

1049
03:17:42,100 --> 03:17:51,000
i focus on do i just dump points in intelligence or should i get up to a 50 vigor probably vigor

1050
03:17:51,000 --> 03:18:05,370
i would imagine it's a 60 and you both i'll go back and forth between the two let's get into 60

1051
03:18:06,329 --> 03:18:17,579
okay so we have okay this spell is dog shit get rid of it i have this a doula's moon blade which

1052
03:18:17,579 --> 03:18:23,979
is going to be insane uh i use i use style light all the time swift is good comments good i don't

1053
03:18:23,979 --> 03:18:39,879
have anything better though okay did they buff some of this shit to not be awful which one of

1054
03:18:39,879 --> 03:18:46,090
these is actually worth using now crystal barrage is terrible but some of these actually worth

1055
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:58,659
using they're not just terrible the arc is better now the comet i don't have that but like night

1056
03:18:58,659 --> 03:19:05,989
comet or something great bow is good now great glint stone shot was buffed that's just better

1057
03:19:07,899 --> 03:19:19,909
that's cost less too maybe i'll try that instead of the um in a comet there's an ice spell that's

1058
03:19:19,909 --> 03:19:29,940
like comet did they make okay question is meteor any good because this was terrible terrible really

1059
03:19:29,940 --> 03:19:44,579
truly terrible truly awful it's still useless how about night comet and i'll put it on there

1060
03:19:44,579 --> 03:19:52,280
all right let's see how cool this move is yeah okay can i charge it

1061
03:19:56,620 --> 03:20:09,510
holy shit that's an arc how far does it go and with member this is important

1062
03:20:11,110 --> 03:20:21,979
this staff is reduces casting time of sorceries so i that actually is really quickly happening here

1063
03:20:22,540 --> 03:20:38,010
awesome you can multi hit you get a better meteor later on like the guy at the bottom of the tower

1064
03:20:38,010 --> 03:20:48,489
okay say so one of the best aoe trash killing spells it feels like it it's a huge arc

1065
03:20:49,290 --> 03:21:35,270
i wonder how it does uh damage wise oh shit who's that who the fuck is this person can we talk

1066
03:21:35,270 --> 03:21:53,350
it's one of the assassins why would i be fighting him why would i fight blade i don't think i should

1067
03:21:53,350 --> 03:22:35,659
fight blade i like this guy he's lost he lost his mind what oh oh shit he is crazy holy shit

1068
03:22:35,659 --> 03:22:53,219
how much damage did i just try you see what i just did why would i just floating in the air

1069
03:22:53,860 --> 03:23:21,370
oh my god i got him what no i why does it have to be getting killed royal greatsword in all of his

1070
03:23:21,370 --> 03:23:39,959
armor i really liked that guy so he went mad okay so he went mad this is int greatsword decorated

1071
03:23:39,959 --> 03:23:46,709
in royal carrion style favorite weapon of lied the half wolf in defiance of the fate he was born to

1072
03:23:47,350 --> 03:23:53,829
lied for to serve no master but runny as proof the sword was imbued with a cold magic at the

1073
03:23:53,829 --> 03:24:00,360
moment the oath was sworn confuse the greatsword with frost and perform a forward somersault

1074
03:24:00,360 --> 03:24:11,299
i can't do it but that's cool that's a beautiful weapon

1075
03:24:16,489 --> 03:24:28,549
oh that's that's a beautiful weapon very cool so what about the armor i would feel kind of

1076
03:24:28,549 --> 03:24:41,319
icky putting on the armor don't you think so it feels like it doesn't feel right well worn

1077
03:24:41,559 --> 03:24:48,360
black armor of the man wolf blade pelters as a cape protecting from cold why was the blade of

1078
03:24:48,360 --> 03:24:56,500
ronnie but the cold bothered him anyway frozen reference does actually they actually put that

1079
03:24:56,500 --> 03:25:21,370
in that seems really out of place the cold bothered him anyway but um the scaled armor is better

1080
03:25:21,930 --> 03:25:31,590
just is gauntlets are good though the gauntlets on anything do i have anything better these are

1081
03:25:31,590 --> 03:25:46,090
still medium load scaled gauntlet this is better it just is oh but uh i can stay i could put blades

1082
03:25:46,090 --> 03:25:54,459
graves on still medium load yeah i think i feel like the scaled armor is some of the best armor

1083
03:25:54,459 --> 03:26:11,239
in the game very interesting very cool very cool okay george r.r. martin is a huge frozen fan really

1084
03:26:11,239 --> 03:26:19,030
that's funny all right that takes care of that should i go what about did i do all this there's

1085
03:26:19,030 --> 03:26:29,719
still this i don't understand this i don't know where this person is i don't know where

1086
03:26:29,719 --> 03:26:38,649
this person even is but i'll go see if he's in there go up and go to ronnie's go up to ronnie's

1087
03:26:38,649 --> 03:26:59,989
room i mean like up here go talk to the ronnie doll ronnie fell up here yeah i did i did ronnie's

1088
03:26:59,989 --> 03:27:37,770
quest i did complete ronnie's quest the whole thing not here did i not have this go to the

1089
03:27:37,770 --> 03:27:58,069
other tower oh i can get the grace why is my cam so small i don't want to take it up that much

1090
03:27:58,069 --> 03:28:08,870
space is some of this stuff to see on the screen okay so i can talk to the doll i take it thou has

1091
03:28:08,870 --> 03:28:18,489
noticed i shouldn't be surprised i thought i might expand a little further upon the order i envision

1092
03:28:18,489 --> 03:28:25,899
mine will be an order not of gold the stars and moon of the chill night i would keep them

1093
03:28:25,899 --> 03:28:34,059
far from the earth beneath our feet as it is now life and souls and order are bound tightly together

1094
03:28:34,059 --> 03:28:43,079
but i would have them at a great remove and have the certainties of sight emotion faith and touch

1095
03:28:43,799 --> 03:28:50,520
all become impossibilities which is why i would abandon this soil what with mine order

1096
03:28:51,079 --> 03:29:01,059
wouldst thou come to me even now a one and only lord you want to get rid of all of our

1097
03:29:02,180 --> 03:29:27,180
five senses touch sight smell taste gravity touch sight smell touch sight smell taste

1098
03:29:28,059 --> 03:29:45,180
what water hearing so she wants to remove all of our senses no i don't want to do that

1099
03:29:45,739 --> 03:29:50,969
wait you mean you tell you tell me i never be able to taste the steak again i don't know if we can

1100
03:29:50,969 --> 03:30:15,100
do that ronnie i don't think i can do that i got another great run he's making a utopia we don't

1101
03:30:15,100 --> 03:30:24,649
know that i walked through like a lake of rotten stuff grabbed a ring and put it on her finger and

1102
03:30:24,649 --> 03:30:39,850
i did all of a sudden i'm just supposed to trust everything that she says yes he wants to free the

1103
03:30:39,850 --> 03:31:03,270
souls what about what i want to do so i get to make a few stipulations here fuck again look if

1104
03:31:03,270 --> 03:31:08,790
i'm gonna do all the work um then i get to make a few like i get to make a few amendments to this

1105
03:31:12,090 --> 03:31:19,219
okay yeah you can remove all of our senses except for once on friday friday or sat on thursday we

1106
03:31:19,219 --> 03:31:33,340
get to taste food on thursday and then that that's fine i want once a week and i also require

1107
03:31:33,899 --> 03:31:38,840
it on thursday as well to get to be able to feel that feeling of really digging in deep and getting

1108
03:31:38,840 --> 03:31:43,350
a wicked huge booger out of your nose that's been bothering you for like an hour i want to

1109
03:31:43,350 --> 03:32:00,329
be able to have that feeling it feels great sometimes happens in the shower all right what

1110
03:32:00,329 --> 03:32:05,610
else do you want to do gold but the stars and the moon of the jits i don't want to be cold

1111
03:32:05,610 --> 03:32:15,420
chilly nights no and i would abandon this soil with my words thou come to me even now i don't

1112
03:32:15,420 --> 03:32:24,819
know about that it seems kind of like depressing it's like cold and dark not like i don't know i

1113
03:32:24,819 --> 03:32:33,579
don't know i don't like that chilly all right well that was that's kind of cool let's go that way

1114
03:32:44,729 --> 03:32:49,610
we know you're doing the dung eater ending i mean i don't even i don't know what ending i'm gonna do

1115
03:32:50,409 --> 03:32:56,010
all i'm saying is as of this moment right now i don't like being cold i keep my place pretty

1116
03:32:56,010 --> 03:33:01,510
warm we've had this conversation i don't want to be like freezing out and like some fucking

1117
03:33:01,510 --> 03:33:11,819
chilly night thing no i think 72 to 73 degrees i like i like it i like my place to be like 72

1118
03:33:11,819 --> 03:33:25,559
73 i like it hot okay let's go over here and see what's in that tower that's the correct

1119
03:33:25,559 --> 03:33:33,159
temperature you wouldn't believe how many people think i am an insane person for wanting to have

1120
03:33:33,639 --> 03:33:42,700
be like 73 degrees am i the crazy one somewhere between 73 and 74 i think is a perfect indoor

1121
03:33:42,700 --> 03:33:53,639
temperature is that that weird i don't think it is and i don't know how people oh yeah i like it i

1122
03:33:53,639 --> 03:34:05,959
like it like 63 64 i would die in that i would i would die in that temp 64 65 that's way too cold

1123
03:34:07,399 --> 03:34:25,459
62 60 no 68 okay i could understand 68 like 66 to 68 69 anything under 66 65 is that's

1124
03:34:25,459 --> 03:34:36,840
way 64 no way too cold i already did this so i'll just go in it so we can anything under 71

1125
03:34:37,399 --> 03:34:43,799
i'd say 70 is fine 70 is getting there but i think 68 is the lowest i would be like comfortable

1126
03:34:44,520 --> 03:34:52,340
maybe like a little higher less than 68 is also psychotic i would i you look oh yeah i did i did

1127
03:34:52,340 --> 03:35:07,829
sorry all right cool it's time uh it's time to go towards this what i assume is one of the final

1128
03:35:07,829 --> 03:35:28,659
areas of the game i'm gonna go for it let's do it i'm very excited oh i didn't go to that

1129
03:35:29,379 --> 03:35:49,579
me strong will take care of that all right so how do i get there i make this jump not that

1130
03:35:49,579 --> 03:36:08,899
i really want yeah and i it looks like i can be planning on beating the game tonight i would

1131
03:36:08,899 --> 03:36:21,559
highly highly doubt that i'm going to assume that this whole this this whole area up here

1132
03:36:22,579 --> 03:36:30,600
at the very least would take probably a whole stream but we'll see i i want to go take a look

1133
03:36:30,600 --> 03:36:39,829
it's at least probably three or four more streams yeah whatever i look i'm

1134
03:36:42,059 --> 03:36:46,860
there's always that theory right where oh uh i'm playing the same thing over and over again and

1135
03:36:47,420 --> 03:36:51,260
it's the same game and people are getting tired of the same game over and over and people want

1136
03:36:51,260 --> 03:36:56,870
to see something else and i i think this has been really great i've been having a great time

1137
03:36:58,500 --> 03:37:05,739
um so i don't have a reason not to just keep playing this until i am satisfied with it right

1138
03:37:07,379 --> 03:37:23,420
uh somebody said go to the one near the tree there's a lot of people here i i'm really actually

1139
03:37:23,420 --> 03:37:29,159
very very surprised at the amount of people that are here i was thinking right the first stream had

1140
03:37:30,120 --> 03:37:33,979
a lot like there was like 15 to 20 000 people on that first stream or two and it's like holy

1141
03:37:33,979 --> 03:37:39,819
shit that's an insane amount of people to watch me play elden ring there's still a lot of people

1142
03:37:39,819 --> 03:37:49,739
here um so not that i've paid that much attention to that but that number is i mean i was i did not

1143
03:37:49,739 --> 03:37:54,459
think this many people were gonna watch me of all people play this game because i yeah it's maybe

1144
03:37:54,459 --> 03:37:59,180
after the first like few streams or whatever okay but i'm still going and people are still here so

1145
03:37:59,180 --> 03:38:21,030
i'm gonna keep doing all right uh i need to head that way do i get over there go back to that

1146
03:38:21,030 --> 03:38:37,959
previous bonfire it's fun oh this it looks like a little place i can go can i go like down here

1147
03:38:38,760 --> 03:38:53,819
one of the northeast of the city is this one here or this one here yeah i can't get there from here

1148
03:38:53,819 --> 03:39:04,620
probably from here right yeah because i could go yeah this one randy's supposed to be saying

1149
03:39:04,620 --> 03:39:15,610
the literal opposite of what she says all right so now i gotta get down here

1150
03:39:23,860 --> 03:39:36,379
this one go back to the main street you want that central road that had the urn tree avatar in it

1151
03:39:36,379 --> 03:39:49,899
ah i have to go okay so i have to go down from here i gotta go like this way and then down and

1152
03:39:49,899 --> 03:40:08,680
around right i believe this is correct okay i know where i'm going use that blood key item

1153
03:40:10,500 --> 03:40:28,860
i don't want to summon mog in an elevator you want to see mog in an elevator then just wait

1154
03:40:28,860 --> 03:40:37,540
for when randomizer mods come out wait for like the bosses can be enemies mod okay so now we gotta

1155
03:40:37,540 --> 03:40:57,319
go this way here uh-huh already a thing i would i mean they all existed for dark souls 3 and dark

1156
03:40:57,319 --> 03:41:04,120
souls 1 there we go this is what we're doing now this is exactly okay so everybody freaked out when

1157
03:41:04,120 --> 03:41:06,920
i walked down here because they were like dude wrong way so now this is the right way

1158
03:41:07,639 --> 03:41:24,250
i think i already did a little bit of this so let's go let's just go what level am i

1159
03:41:24,809 --> 03:41:36,620
i am level 109 which i believe puts me in level zone with this upcoming end game content area

1160
03:41:37,260 --> 03:41:49,000
i would take a guess well i guess i did that the fucking complete wrong direction

1161
03:41:49,879 --> 03:41:56,680
all right stop being lazy and fight them you are lazy you could have had that easily

1162
03:41:56,680 --> 03:42:04,899
i'm just like the fucking laziest sorcerer in the world just like with my bubble wand just

1163
03:42:05,700 --> 03:42:32,020
hopping around like an idiot yeah i got this too you're right i'm gonna go to bog stream instead

1164
03:42:44,459 --> 03:43:00,389
i have a few unpowered ruins i do i really do oh what a pain i should i really should have just

1165
03:43:03,239 --> 03:43:08,360
godrix is still one of the best when i got the other one and i looked at it it seemed like

1166
03:43:08,360 --> 03:43:13,350
it was just better than the other one in every way godrix increases all your stats by five

1167
03:43:14,229 --> 03:43:20,149
and renales increases your health fp and stamina but that's already happening with

1168
03:43:21,030 --> 03:43:26,600
godrix plus five on like endurance and shit right it almost feels like not unnecessary

1169
03:43:35,700 --> 03:43:41,940
yeah i i know i have to i haven't been using any rune arcs it's bad they would i do i gotta

1170
03:43:41,940 --> 03:43:53,479
start using them for bosses remind me literally the best move in the fucking whole game

1171
03:43:58,940 --> 03:44:33,450
there's one of these guys here that goes far as fuck what i was just in awe of how crazy that

1172
03:44:33,450 --> 03:45:24,500
move is is there another one good move wait a minute wait a minute i i need to look at

1173
03:45:24,500 --> 03:45:53,180
something strengthens cold sorcery that counts right so is two intelligence more than what this

1174
03:45:53,180 --> 03:46:00,579
would give to that spell or is this better i don't i don't know what how much percentage whatever that

1175
03:46:00,579 --> 03:46:15,459
means not at your level okay oh okay so i was doing like 350 before i wonder how much it does

1176
03:46:15,459 --> 03:46:27,139
now that's gonna be better is there anything else that does that okay great i don't think i care

1177
03:46:27,139 --> 03:46:44,950
about hp vastly raises maximum fp i already have that on is anything else boost fp no i already

1178
03:46:44,950 --> 03:46:52,250
have a lot of this on do i have anything else potency of sorceries that would count right

1179
03:46:52,889 --> 03:47:11,670
okay do i have anything else i think i want to keep the staff on though and listen one of these

1180
03:47:11,670 --> 03:47:25,209
boost cold sorcery which would be a huge deal it's a glint blade sorcery enhances crystalline

1181
03:47:25,209 --> 03:47:43,299
sorcery not cold let's find out let's take a look at the offices renalis staff does full moon spell

1182
03:47:43,860 --> 03:48:01,899
i don't think i have that no i don't it's a remembrance but i can go to one of those bells

1183
03:48:01,899 --> 03:48:11,030
and get it can i i didn't use any of the bell demon things i mean i might have to go do that

1184
03:48:11,590 --> 03:48:29,670
because that i'm into that that's cool you need 60 into staff i have 55 right now

1185
03:48:33,540 --> 03:48:43,829
though it's not like i won't get there or i could take a rune because i'm very curious because this

1186
03:48:43,829 --> 03:48:49,559
move is insane that move might actually replace how i feel about the baby rattle

1187
03:48:50,280 --> 03:48:59,909
because so far the this has been carrying for essentially the last 30 game hours it's an awesome

1188
03:48:59,909 --> 03:49:19,000
move but if that move is that good which it is i think i'm gonna have to use it lame drake talisman

1189
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:39,059
one the glint stone uh from cell yeah yeah yeah maybe usat staff is the highest damage staff in

1190
03:49:39,059 --> 03:49:49,799
the game yeah but me i don't have to do the best you know it's not about what the best item is it's

1191
03:49:49,799 --> 03:49:57,500
what how much fun you have with whatever you're doing i need to one all right sneak

1244
04:05:03,159 --> 04:05:06,520
in like the two seconds you're in the tab right now right good i'm just walking around

1245
04:05:07,079 --> 04:05:33,260
what the fuck what the fuck oh my god that was fucking insane so whose run is this

1246
04:05:39,299 --> 04:05:55,739
tab is i don't i never did this what does his run do greatly raises max hp but by how much though

1247
04:05:58,760 --> 04:06:08,469
raises i feel like they kind of feel like they kind of botched this in a way because raises all

1248
04:06:08,469 --> 04:06:17,959
attributes raises health raises max health raises health raises health raises health like i feel like

1249
04:06:17,959 --> 04:06:26,629
i wish these were a little different they all kind of do the same thing but maybe some do it a little

1250
04:06:26,629 --> 04:06:30,940
bit better than the others i would like i would have loved it if it was like this one is all

1251
04:06:30,940 --> 04:06:37,659
attributes this one is you do more damage but take more damage this one is your fp uh the

1252
04:06:37,659 --> 04:06:44,139
cost spell costs are cut in half or something right these all kind of feel way too similar

1253
04:06:44,139 --> 04:06:54,379
they're just talismans for that these feel very similar like that raises max hp fp and stamina

1254
04:06:54,379 --> 04:07:01,860
raises max hp it's like why would you use this one i feel like they keep getting slowly worse

1255
04:07:06,620 --> 04:07:14,340
unless that's an insane amount you get to choose what an ember does

1256
04:07:15,540 --> 04:07:21,139
yeah i mean it's it's it's cool but i think that's the i think that part of the game for me is

1257
04:07:21,860 --> 04:07:33,290
feels the like the least kind of interesting it's not that much of a complaint though considering

1258
04:07:36,059 --> 04:07:44,379
your health bar will cover the entire screen well that's cool um we can keep going is there

1259
04:07:44,379 --> 04:07:49,590
anything else here that i need to see or is that it you sometimes these towers have weird shit in

1260
04:07:49,590 --> 04:08:09,459
them mog is here mog is not here yeah you have to use the rune arc i just have i'm just not using

1261
04:08:09,459 --> 04:08:16,790
them what does he hate this game because it was hyped up and i all the hype fucking failed man

1262
04:08:20,600 --> 04:08:28,280
like look i mean look at how big this map is it's annoying it's annoying it's like too much

1263
04:08:28,280 --> 04:08:33,670
it's like too much stuff to see they should have just had it like be this area here and

1264
04:08:33,670 --> 04:08:39,340
like this is dlc and shit like this is just like fucking stupid all this up here is just like i

1265
04:08:39,340 --> 04:08:43,780
don't know it's like a waste of time they could have like condensed this and made it like limb

1266
04:08:43,780 --> 04:08:49,239
grave and caitlin and that would have been much better like hyped up fucking hype is so dumb

1267
04:08:49,879 --> 04:09:04,840
all right let me rest here yeah you're you're you're going this is why like game design is so

1268
04:09:04,840 --> 04:09:11,500
fucking stupid you expect me as a player to go like walk from here if like and eventually go

1269
04:09:11,500 --> 04:09:16,659
like spend all the time to go all the way up here i just don't i don't understand where like where

1270
04:09:16,659 --> 04:09:29,450
the time they think they think we have the time for this it's way too far i'm just spending these

1271
04:09:29,450 --> 04:09:50,340
ruins oh this is cool why don't they let you just buy ruins with money i know it's like what if i

1272
04:09:50,340 --> 04:09:56,340
don't fucking want to get ruins i should be able to spend 9.99 and get like you know 30 40 000 souls

1273
04:09:59,829 --> 04:10:27,719
that was awful this should be loot boxes you just open up to get armor the move is okay is this

1274
04:10:27,719 --> 04:10:44,120
seriously elden bucks let me actually go down here is there a map fragment yet no not quite

1275
04:10:44,840 --> 04:10:54,649
you have a horse i know but i don't want to just like this is a cool area i don't want to

1276
04:10:54,649 --> 04:11:00,739
just run around and forget i don't want to just fucking forget where i'm not seeing anything and

1277
04:11:00,739 --> 04:11:15,659
miss everything i would have missed that if i got on the horse this is this game just reminds me

1278
04:11:15,659 --> 04:11:19,819
when video games would just fucking video games video games are just allowed to be video games

1279
04:11:19,819 --> 04:11:43,100
that was it i love how i've turned for you guys like the boston accent guy into things that like

1280
04:11:43,100 --> 04:11:47,819
i'm allowed to kind of come out of my like i can just say whatever i want as that voice that

1281
04:11:47,899 --> 04:11:54,459
character and it's universally despised anything i say so it's like i don't know it's kind of like

1282
04:11:54,459 --> 04:11:58,940
kind of relieving and almost like liberating in a way that i can just fucking go like this and say

1283
04:11:58,940 --> 04:12:02,780
whatever i fucking want and like we all know it's not real and we can all it doesn't matter i can

1284
04:12:02,780 --> 04:12:09,930
say anything i don't know why it has to be like the boston guy with the cigarette outside of a cvs

1285
04:12:09,930 --> 04:12:17,399
like i don't know why it has to be that guy like i don't know why that person in my brain has a

1286
04:12:17,399 --> 04:12:23,959
tank top a cigarette short sandals sitting outside of a cvs with a gatorade in the other hand

1287
04:12:23,959 --> 04:12:28,920
and like you're walking into the cvs and he's just like i fucking i don't know why that you

1288
04:12:28,920 --> 04:12:34,170
can't just buy fucking rooms with money like all right yeah all right man like i don't know why

1289
04:12:34,170 --> 04:12:37,770
that's who i see that's what happens i don't know why that's that's how i feel what would happen

1290
04:12:39,930 --> 04:12:44,010
and you just go you go into the cvs and then you leave and that guy just kind of shows up

1291
04:12:44,010 --> 04:12:51,299
everywhere in random places you know like that that guy you could be at line at the deli and

1292
04:12:51,299 --> 04:12:55,030
he'll just turn around and he still has cigarette in his hand by the way and like they haven't

1293
04:12:55,030 --> 04:13:02,180
thrown him out yet he's like damn i wish they were fucking two drive-throughs three drive-through

1294
04:13:02,180 --> 04:13:13,819
windows instead of one at like every restaurant all right dude like okay it's just like a bot

1295
04:13:13,819 --> 04:13:21,879
the boston npc guy you just you could just say pretty much whatever you want as boston

1296
04:13:21,879 --> 04:13:39,659
like gta character and that's it and here this way okay why is the tank top gas station cigarette

1297
04:13:39,739 --> 04:13:53,579
boston guy invested in elden ring i don't know he just he's invested in everything and he would

1298
04:13:53,579 --> 04:13:59,930
always be like like it would always be after the after he sucks it in right like hey what's up man

1299
04:14:01,750 --> 04:14:07,770
see the price of bitcoin like he would talk when it was in his lungs and then you would see it

1300
04:14:07,770 --> 04:14:15,979
trailing out slow like it that there's a person that just lives in my head completely rent-free

1301
04:14:15,979 --> 04:14:18,139
it just does it all right easy easy easy

of damage though that was a lot one swing from that uh almost killed me in one hit so is this

1330
04:23:45,030 --> 04:23:49,110
the stage of the from software games where we all do a ton of damage and we're all just going to

1455
05:00:29,720 --> 05:00:39,110

1456
05:00:39,110 --> 05:00:48,549
doth stuff i haven't done that in a long time thursday four o'clock pacific friday four o'clock

1457
05:00:48,549 --> 05:00:56,099
pacific same time same time we uh usually start for this was just kind of impromptu i was supposed

1458
05:00:56,099 --> 05:01:04,599
to stream tomorrow which is technically today but i just had the craving i had to play i think we

1459
05:01:04,599 --> 05:01:16,540
made some pretty good progress i mean i got pretty far i think this is still a lot to do over here

1460
05:01:16,540 --> 05:01:24,619
and probably even back here too i also maybe want to go back to the sewer because he was like oh

1461
05:01:24,619 --> 05:01:37,610
converse with the three fingers three fingers two fingers it's a hand right like that makes sense

1462
05:01:37,610 --> 05:01:45,139
doesn't it why would there be two fingers and three fingers was it the same hand whose hand

1463
05:01:45,139 --> 05:01:50,180
is that why is there two hands is more than two hands like somebody have two hands like some

1464
05:01:50,900 --> 05:02:05,419
giant god or something uh we'll go back to it i'll see you guys on thursday i all right let me ask

1465
05:02:05,419 --> 05:02:13,819
you a question can we do a poll real quick in chat uh would you rather break it up on thursday
