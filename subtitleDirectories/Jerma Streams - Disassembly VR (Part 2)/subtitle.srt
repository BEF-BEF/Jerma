00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:14,730
Good afternoon. Welcome back to another edition of ME! Hi guys. It's been 14 minutes since

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:25,859
Jerma said 10 minutes. That's not a big deal. An extra four minutes. Sometimes I say 10 minutes

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:38,310
and it's 40, so I'll take the four this time. Long minutes. Yeah, you gotta count them slower.

4
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:47,500
That's four minutes of my life I'll never get back. I'm sorry. Anyways, hi. We are going to

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:57,219
do, just pick up right where we left off yesterday in Disassembly VR. Maybe just joining us. And you

6
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:08,099
weren't here yesterday. This game's a treat. I like it. I'm having a great time. You take

7
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:14,950
things apart and that's it. That's the whole game. But it's fun. I don't know why. It just

8
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:25,510
like, it just squeezes my brain. It's very relaxing. It's very fun. And today, I've got

9
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:35,000
news for you guys. For the first time ever. Ever. That's right. For the first time ever,

10
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:42,409
I am going to be sitting down in VR because standing up takes too much energy and moving

11
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,370
around room scale takes a lot of out of me. And so I could probably stream for more than

12
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:56,359
four hours today. The chair! There it is. Never, I've never done this before. It's,

13
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,299
how does it feel? First impressions. The seat's a little springy. I like the color.

14
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:21,180
But here's the, hold on, for all you office friends. How's the spin? I definitely should

15
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:32,520
not have just done that before going into VR. We're going to take a minute here.

16
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:45,419
Just sit here. Spin? Well oiled, I'd say. It's pretty well oiled. Okay. I think I'm good.

17
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:59,819
Try spinning. That's a neat trick. Take apart this chair. No. You're going to be sitting

18
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,509
there the whole stream and you have workout clothes on. I'm going to get up. This is just,

19
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:10,539
look, this is my, when I'm sitting at the desk and I got the screwdriver,

20
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:18,069
I don't need to go in like this. Where's that screw? Okay. Where is it? Like I'm like a

21
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:29,099
fucking T-Rex. Like, now don't do that again. I'm not doing that for after part two.

22
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,139
God damn it. It's cause I'm too far away. I can't like see what I'm doing. You know,

23
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:40,949
I like, sometimes when I'm this close, I can see what I'm doing over here. I can't see what

24
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,310
I'm doing over here. Sometimes I'm just going to do random dumb shit like that, apparently.

25
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:52,900
But where am I? I'm doing Raptor part two. Spin in VR. Are you trying to kill me?

26
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:02,860
You're trying to kill me. I'm not doing that. The, the, the cord's going to get all tangled up.

27
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:12,090
But let me get the audio on. I can't fucking believe I just did like a dinosaur again.

28
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:19,129
And I didn't have the mask on this time. So it's all right. Sometimes you make mistakes.

29
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,170
I just happen to make them in front of a thousand fucking people.

30
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,819
All right. Disassembly. Are we good in the frame here? I think so. Yeah, this looks fine.

31
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,379
You guys can hear it. Uh, I've never done this before. How am I going to do this?

32
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:49,079
Around the back? I don't know if this is a good idea. We'll find out, right?

33
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:10,339
Hey, look at that. Oh, this already feels way better. All right. There you guys are.

34
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:17,459
I can see you. What do you say? What the fuck? Screw it in a little.

35
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:30,649
Is that bad? Did I even scoot in? There we go. Webcam on the floor and sit on the floor. I'm not

36
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:38,620
going to do that. This is not the way it should be. It should be like this. I don't like that.

37
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:55,300
It feels like I have a big piece of hair. All right. When we last left off, this like fucking

38
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:03,589
feels weird. I feel like I shouldn't be sitting. Fuck it. All right. How it's made theme or

39
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,029
riot. We did that last night. All right. Where we leave off? We left off here

40
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:19,850
at the missile. Do I, we already did. Do I have to do the missile? Do I got to take

41
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,879
up off this whole missile? It's like 5,000 parts. Okay. All right. All right. I'm going to,

42
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:39,579
I'm going to do it. I feel like I have to do, I have to turn, right? That's the only

43
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:48,810
way this is going to work for me in my brain. I have to like, all right, this is fine.

44
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:57,079
So we got, if you don't know how this works, lower the seat. What is the seat too high?

45
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:04,949
Why is the seat too high? I don't know. Yeah, I get that for you guys. I got it.

46
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:18,759
Is this it? I don't know which one it is. I'm afraid to press a button.

47
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:31,639
Oh, I just like flipped a switch. It's the eject button. Wait, it's this one here. I

48
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:52,149
think. Oh, better. Is it fine? All right. All right. Here we go. I'll see you guys later.

49
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,720
This is how you work with this game. This game is a game about disassembling things

50
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,769
and not, you don't, you guys are over here, right? And not putting them back together.

51
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:11,019
I kind of like this. This is, this is better screwdriver. How many parts are there? A hundred.

52
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,500
This is going to take a while. I hope you're ready for the long haul here.

53
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:28,339
Top part comes off. It's going to explode. It's not, we already tested it last night.

54
00:08:29,139 --> 00:09:08,570
This thing is a dud. Oh God. I already don't like this. Okay. We're fine. Everything's fine.

55
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:17,929
Stand up. No, I can't. I, my back has been bothering me and like stand up and moving

56
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,330
around. I need to sit and work at my desk with my tools. That's the tinkerer. Okay.

57
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:35,850
Isn't that a good title today? All right. That looks fine. Can I get any of these off yet?

58
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:46,730
Oh, one of the fins comes off. Yeah. No cheating. I got to beat all these.

59
00:09:51,820 --> 00:10:00,019
Room scale, seated VR. I, I got the wrong settings, but it's okay. I'm improvising.

60
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:22,330
What is holding this on? Is that it? If you're just joining us with, oh,

61
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,720
oh, I think I can get this off this plate. No, right here. This will come off in a second.

62
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:39,690
Guy like disassembles a nuclear bomb sitting in his living room. It's not even my living room.

63
00:10:41,480 --> 00:11:01,340
It's my office, right guys? All right. Am I going to bloody nose? No. Am I? I can't tell.

64
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:15,500
Well, how do I get this off? There's blood everywhere. If I just didn't know,

65
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:25,720
there's just blood just all over me. That'd be so fucked up. The whole stream,

66
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:37,139
I just have like a faucet coming out of my nose. That would be insane. There's a lot of

67
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:47,179
screws in this thing. How many more screws are there? Someone call the camp. He doesn't know.

68
00:11:47,179 --> 00:12:00,100
It's a missile. I don't think it's made to be disassembled. That's true. You're all right.

69
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:12,460
Okay. How many more? Oh my God. I got to get, oh, that was a big juicy one. No.

70
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,929
Whoa. Okay. There's the nuclear reactor. That's what it looks like inside guys.

71
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:38,899
First ever image of a black hole. All right. So can I get this out?

72
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:46,169
I don't think I can get this out. Can I pull it? I can pull it. Don't blow up.

73
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,450
I got to get a better fucking view than this. I'm sorry guys.

74
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:10,549
That's better. Can this come off? What is holding this on?

75
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:29,059
Don't explode. It's not going to explode. Oh, my rocket contest.

76
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:57,240
Oh, man. I'm going to win first prize. What do I do with this? Can I take this apart too?

77
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:19,690
I think so. The wrench. That one wrench. I don't, I got no idea. Oh, I got no idea.

78
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:35,000
Can I do anything else with this thing? Whoa. Okay. Put this down. This is the engine.

79
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,659
Can this come out? Oh, wait a minute. Ah, these are going to look at that.

80
00:14:48,379 --> 00:15:10,360
We got extra lazy. No, I think this is done. What do we got left? 57. We're almost halfway there.

81
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,559
Can I pull the middle out? Yeah, this is where we're going to be careful.

82
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:23,179
So really slowly. Like a fucking magician. So there's a charcoal filter. The thing that makes

83
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:31,750
it explode. This is the thing to purify the water. That wasn't the thug. It's going to

84
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:38,309
roll. It's going to break the window. Oh, that's unfortunate. That was going to keep

85
00:15:38,309 --> 00:16:04,409
rolling. Hold on. Give me that. Fuck. No, here we go. Yeah, I dropped something. Yeah,

86
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:17,289
it's over there. It's rolling towards the window. Oh shit. That's going to cost some money.

87
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,850
Those cheap windows made out of candy ribbon. I shouldn't have done the candy ribbon.

88
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:52,019
What's in here? I think that's it for this. Give me another one.

89
00:16:55,659 --> 00:17:27,420
Oh, stay here. This is the brain. I got to get the snippers. There it is. I'm trying to roll it.

90
00:17:27,420 --> 00:18:04,339
I'm trying to roll it and break the window. Wait a minute. No. I thought it was going to

91
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:09,349
keep rolling. Riveting content. That would have been funny if it fucking broke the window

92
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:20,500
and you know it. He's still covered in blood from his nosebleed. He's losing brain cells.

93
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,940
What even makes this thing explode? This is supposed to be true to life.

94
00:18:28,940 --> 00:19:04,410
It's reaching there again. All right. I don't even know what to grab. Can I pull this? Okay,

95
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:22,410
I can get the panel off. There it is. There it is, guys. Be careful. What does it say?

96
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:32,549
Explosive Tritonol. S-P-E-O-1-O-2-9-D. Total nine kilograms. So this is explosive.

97
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:47,079
Just sit that there. I don't know whatever that is. What else is in here? How many parts

98
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:56,650
are there? 50 parts? Am I missing something? Where are these other 50 parts? Are they inside

99
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:10,259
this dome? Hold on. Ricochet. That was worth like five points. It's still stuck in there.

100
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:22,259
All right. Give me the little guy here. No. I don't understand. What is holding this in here?

101
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:53,609
How do I get this out of here? There's another panel? I don't see another panel.

102
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:20,220
Whoa. This is dumb. All right. Here we go. We're going to be very careful here. No. Okay.

103
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:37,019
Easy. Don't let me near in nuclear power. It's still being held in.

104
00:21:43,930 --> 00:22:04,250
There it is. Look at that. Interesting stuff. There's still 42 parts. It doesn't

105
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,000
explode apparently. Okay. So just set it over here. Just put it on the ground. This thing's

106
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:54,970
making me nervous. What is the other like 50 parts? What? Wait a minute. Damn it. Okay. So

107
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:07,140
it's this thing. Oh shit. There's more in here. Oh, this is the computer. This is the other

108
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:29,220
computer. There's two CPUs in here. All right. Let's get this off. Pliers? Jesus. All right.

109
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:45,750
Do I have to take this shit off too? No. What is this? All right. Can I take the top off?

110
00:23:46,309 --> 00:24:04,250
Yeah. Okay. Let's hold this on. CPU connector. Can I take this shit off? No. None of these need

111
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:12,519
to be removed. Damn. That's kind of cool. All right. Cool. Now can this be removed? It can.

112
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:23,480
Nothing in there. Last piece. We've got, oh, there's one more internal thing. I got to,

113
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,450
no, not the crowbar. This thing. That's not the right tool?

114
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:58,039
And what world are you talking about here? No. Not yet. Where are these other? Oh shit. Okay.

115
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:10,180
Does this, that's it for that? No. One piece there. That's it. This comes off.

116
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,930
This comes out. Wow. That's what it looks like in there. Well, this is so cool.

117
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:47,339
All right. I got the lens off. Well, this is where the 50 parts come from. My God. Wait,

118
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:52,599
is that a reflection? Oh, I can't see myself here. All right. This is that.

119
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:07,369
This is just the toy at the doctor's office for the little kids. Is that it? Two more parts.

120
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:49,019
Bring up the beeper. I did it. Excellent. What's next? I unlocked the magnifying glass.

121
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:57,930
Am I talking to you? Yeah, I am. Oh, I hate when it does that. So let me just

122
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:07,750
fix myself here. What's next? I have to take apart a screwdriver, then a rice cooker,

123
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:18,299
and then the Titanic. This is going to be interesting. Take apart the Titanic. This,

124
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:21,980
I take a 30 set. This is going to be easy. All right. Let's see this one quick.

125
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:39,910
Get a good look at it. Turn it off. Turn it off. So I got a magnifying glass. Let me just

126
00:27:39,910 --> 00:28:01,289
put it out here. This is cool. That's really cool. It just is. I mean, it just is. All right. I

127
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:06,970
got a magnifying glass in this hand. I really am the tinker. I can't do a hammer yet.

128
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:27,990
How do I pull this apart? Are there screws on the screwdriver? Yes, there are. I'm not very

129
00:28:27,990 --> 00:29:05,430
good. Precision is key. Get out of here. Put this down for a minute. What's the last one?

130
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:11,930
Oh, look in there. That's where the batteries go. Anything else over this? No,

131
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:25,529
I think we're done with that. Look at that. That's so cool. I don't know. That's a film

132
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:51,859
canister. Batteries? That's not a screw. I'm almost done with this thing. There's a

133
00:29:51,859 --> 00:30:00,980
little power switch. I need the little one. Give me the pliers. Make this easier on myself.

134
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:32,259
That's it. 18 parts left. This little guy? Give me screws? There's such a weird smell

135
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:42,490
in my room. All right. Interesting. So now let's put it in its... There we go.

136
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:49,930
One, two, three. That's it. I have to battery. Take the batteries apart.

137
00:30:50,650 --> 00:31:23,099
Oops. I don't know what happened here. That's fucking cursed. What just came...

138
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:38,069
Is it flying around the room? I caught that in the corner of my eye.

139
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,970
I can't get this little tab. Come on. Give me this little tab.

140
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:57,799
Final boss. I can't pull these apart. I'm an expert disassembler, guys. Well,

141
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:04,869
this is definitely the next part here. There's the bit. This comes out the back way.

142
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,579
Wait, wait, wait, wait. That's where all these parts are coming from. Look at how

143
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:25,079
tiny this shit is. Get it in there with the tool. The middle part? No, that's it.

144
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:31,960
Six more. I believe it's right here. Yes, it is. What do you got in here?

145
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,299
There's the actual spinning thing to the drill bit. I don't think I can get it yet.

146
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:53,059
There we go. I think that's it. There's only one more thing in here. What's left? Two parts.

147
00:32:53,059 --> 00:33:10,650
What is it? It's the battery, isn't it? Is it the battery? Oh, I got it. No,

148
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:26,490
I didn't. I can't get this. Shit. What is it? Use the gun. No, the gun

149
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:31,859
deletes the whole level. It makes it so you can't do it. What about my neck?

150
00:33:32,500 --> 00:34:05,609
All right, hold on. How do I get this open? How do you open this thing? Right here. Got it.

151
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:16,679
Done. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Titanic. I have no idea what this is going to

152
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:23,900
be like. No, don't replay the level. Get out of here. I have to destroy the whole Titanic,

153
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:37,159
I guess. So we're going to go this way. I'm going to stand up for this one. Are you kidding

154
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:52,760
me? I have to take the Titanic apart. In my chair, there's 151 parts. Swab the deck, babies.

155
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:05,769
Out of the ocean. Did we hit an iceberg? Is this like a level that's already pre-determined?

156
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:24,599
I just wanted to put my hand on the railing. I just wanted to put my hand on the railing.

157
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,360
I was going to do a captain bit where I've been on the seven seas.

158
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:45,050
Holy shit. I'm not going to be able to find that. Oh, look out. Here comes the iceberg.

159
00:35:48,489 --> 00:36:03,619
It's just like a drunk fat guy in a chair. Oh, I got to get over there. Why?

160
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:13,659
Why was that an explosion? Okay, here we go. I need to go fast. I need to go fast.

161
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:45,909
I'm going to be the shittiest like James Bond villain. You thought you could make it out alive,

162
00:36:45,909 --> 00:37:20,409
Mr. Bond. Not on my terms. Hey. Stop it happening.

163
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:30,809
The dining room. Not the dining room. Why did it just come out like that?

164
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,150
It's sinking. I didn't have to do anything.

165
00:37:38,150 --> 00:38:27,079
Okay. Got it. I hit the skybox. No. The skybox is going to shoot back up.

166
00:38:27,079 --> 00:39:01,289
It's alive. That's a whale. Oh my goodness. It's back. Oh no. The sentient wall is coming

167
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:24,039
for revenge. I don't think this is historically accurate. Hold on. Hold on. I don't want to do

168
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:35,829
this again. It's hitting the ground under the water. All right. Get me in there. I'm

169
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:52,460
already seated so it's good. Okay. Where's the dining room? Oh my god. This is so huge.

170
00:39:53,179 --> 00:40:09,820
Is the dining room down? I don't know where it is. There's no map. I'm just

171
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:17,320
no clipping through floors until I find it. Hold on. Get out of here. Where's the dining room?

172
00:40:25,159 --> 00:41:06,920
There it is. Okay. No. No. No. Not yet. Not yet. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop it.

173
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:48,710
No. Come here. Come here. Come here. He's gone. Sorry for that interruption. What the fuck?

174
00:41:48,710 --> 00:42:01,769
I just wanted to put it down. I wanted to put it down. I can't. What? No.

175
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:26,199
I'm just. I'm trying to do a bit here. Why? I just put my hand down and grabbed.

176
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:50,889
Are you good? No. There he goes. You know what? Fuck it. I think we just have to destroy it.

177
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:02,840
All right. This is fine. Welcome to the restaurant. Yeah. We pride ourselves on

178
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:09,769
highest quality food. Do you have a menu I could look at? It's a little cramped in here,

179
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:23,050
don't you think? Yeah. I'll take the swordfish. God. Nothing can destroy the Titanic. I can't even

180
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:26,090
do the bit anymore. I was going to set up like three people and have a discussion about the

181
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:40,360
Titanic. I can't even do that now. Yeah, I can. Yeah, I can. You guys are going to

182
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,480
like this one. I. You watch. Just. Hold on. I got to. I got to get in there and make

183
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,190
people not flip around. Is that like I put wine bottles anywhere? I don't think so.

184
00:43:51,909 --> 00:44:09,610
And can I go? Is there like a captain's chamber? Let me just see what's up here.

185
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:21,639
That's probably like a captain's quarters, right? That has to be.

186
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:40,900
Play the Titanic OST. Yeah, I can't move. I got to let me fix this. This is all tangled

187
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:50,820
up on the chair. Which way is it going? I have no idea. What the fuck is this going?

188
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:04,710
How did I wrap this around like this? I've got to go the other way. Saved. All right. We're

189
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:22,039
good. All right. Let me put on the Titanic. Wait, what was that Celine Dion?

190
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:30,360
Wasn't that one? That's a definite claim of the vaudeville.

191
00:45:41,349 --> 00:46:10,059
Bye, vaude. Go, go, go, go, go. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get

192
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:30,059
there. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get there. I got to do the T pose.

193
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:47,539
I can do the T pose up here, right? No, no, no, no, no, no. Like I, you do. Can I

194
00:46:47,539 --> 00:47:22,550
move his arms? No, no, dummy. Stand. Sorry. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.

195
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,539
Fucking God damn it.

196
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:52,980
Fuck you. Jack, you already killed two people. Just let me help you. Do it. Is it going to

197
00:47:52,980 --> 00:48:31,480
do it? Is this it? Is this the song? I don't think this is the song. Is this even part of

198
00:48:31,559 --> 00:49:02,070
the soundtrack? Jack, I don't know if I can... It's not... Look. Do you see the sky in front

199
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:12,940
of you? Yeah, Jack. It's beautiful. It is beautiful. I never watched this whole movie,

200
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:36,389
so I don't know exactly how the scene went down. Oh, it's beautiful, Jack. It sure is.

201
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:49,030
Let me put you down. Oh, it's beautiful. I know. Just watch out. Watch out for the railing.

202
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:11,880
Where'd she go? I don't know where she went. Oh, Julie. Julie. What's her name?

203
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,380
The ship is all right. I can go get her.

204
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:29,559
She just got wicked, witch of the western.

205
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:41,929
Jack! Wait. Come with me, remember? This is me.

206
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:56,119
Jack! Jack!

207
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:56,199
Jack!

208
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:07,340
I'll never forget about you.

209
00:51:15,480 --> 00:52:01,909
Jack, did you hear that this vessel only costed $29 a dollar?

210
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:08,730
I've never seen the movie, I swear to God. I've never seen Titanic. I don't know what happens.

211
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,050
This iceberg, I don't know the history, but I don't know what happens between the

212
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,949
wind and the category of it.

213
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:55,750
Jack, look!

214
00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:30,730
Oh, my God. Holy shit. I didn't know it was going to be that loud. I'm sorry.

215
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:39,530
Now drive the boat. All right, I'm looking to do a boat one.

216
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:47,289
Can I hear a clip? I need to know how loud that was. I'm so sorry.

217
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:54,969
I had to turn it up for the music. Was it that loud?

218
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:37,829
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Holy shit. Oh, my God.

219
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:57,610
I really did not know that was happening. Holy fuck. I'm so sorry.

220
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,820
I've never seen the movie. That's why it was so loud. I had to hear.

221
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,300
Holy shit, man. All right, let's turn this shit down.

222
00:55:15,900 --> 00:56:00,949
I gotta go pee. I'll be right back. I know you can see me. I'm still processing.

223
00:56:01,750 --> 00:58:42,730
Oh, man. All right. We're going to have to reel it in here.

224
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,570
We're going to go back and disassemble a toaster or something.

225
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:57,079
We'll go back to the Titanic. Let's open it back up.

226
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,019
I'm going to sit back down. Oh, my goodness.

227
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:07,420
We'll do the rice cooker. We'll do the rice cooker.

228
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,380
Kim check. Okay. Do you want to know?

229
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:32,230
Nobody in there. I got this.

230
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:39,980
That's pretty much all I need to say. All right.

231
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,260
Subs. A lot of subs just come in. I missed them.

232
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,340
Oh, there they are. Hans Beats.

233
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,619
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

234
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:59,340
Thank you for the ten community subs. Ten subs from Hans Beats.

235
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,219
Thank you. Much love to you.

236
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:07,590
Congratulations to all those that were blessed by the sub dusting.

237
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,670
And let's go. Let's do the rice cooker.

238
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:19,929
I think the volume has been lowered to a nice level.

239
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:25,159
You can tell me if I'm wrong. All right.

240
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:31,780
I don't know what that is. Why is there an assault rifle?

241
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,179
Oh, it's okay. All right.

242
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:37,980
Back in. Where are my hands over there?

243
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,199
Let's clean this off real quick.

244
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,019
Max volume. No, I can't do that to people for a long period of time.

245
01:00:56,679 --> 01:00:59,000
Okay. Really loud shit is funny.

246
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:01,480
But imagine if you just clicked on the stream.

247
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,039
You just came to the stream for the first time or you just loaded it.

248
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:06,519
You went to like, oh, Twitter or I got a notification.

249
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:07,880
And you're not ready for that.

250
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,699
I don't want to do that for a long period of time.

251
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:20,500
All right. Let me get another sip of my coffee.

252
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:31,139
Fresh brew. Let's go.

253
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:33,780
We'll go back to the Titanic and I will do it normally.

254
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:37,260
I don't know what that means. It's left-handed.

255
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,579
I just thought of the dining room hitting the skybox.

256
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:05,239
I got to get out of this level.

257
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,099
Why am I getting like worms vibes?

258
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:14,869
Look, they're the worms.

259
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:16,309
It's like worms, Armageddon.

260
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:22,230
All right. Let's get the fuck out of here.

261
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:31,909
Why do I have this in my hand?

262
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:32,710
Back to the main menu.

263
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:36,139
Oh, my mind frame. Can you see me?

264
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:42,650
I'm going to turn that down. That's better.

265
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,519
All right. Let's take apart a rice cooker.

266
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:54,070
This is so much nicer. Look at that.

267
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:56,489
Am I out of frame?

268
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,400
No, no. Let me frame.

269
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:07,829
Can I turn it?

270
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,980
It's actually has water in it.

271
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:25,610
Don't need that.

272
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,960
It's dirty.

273
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:31,849
Cut that shit out.

274
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:38,869
All right. So we've got the button here.

275
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:39,510
Can I lift it up?

276
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:43,539
The bottom. There's a screw on the bottom.

277
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:45,460
Can I rip this off?

278
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,719
I don't think so.

279
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:48,679
How many parts are in this?

280
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,920
59. All right. Well, this is a screw.

281
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,110
Oh, shit. Okay.

282
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:03,050
Probably more of this.

283
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:05,059
Let me lean forward here.

284
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:05,940
Let me get a good lean.

285
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:13,739
No, no, no.

286
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:18,340
Give me the pliers.

287
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,050
That's tiny. Look at this.

288
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,409
I can make it. I got to get the microscope.

289
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:33,940
This is next level small.

290
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,250
God damn it.

291
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:20,219
Let's pick it up.

292
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:26,820
All right. Now I can.

293
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,739
Can I grab these?

294
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:31,460
You can grab this.

295
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:33,139
Stop doing that.

296
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:34,420
All right. I need a little screwdriver.

297
01:05:37,929 --> 01:05:39,610
And up. That's a bomb.

298
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,349
This one. Really?

299
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:49,610
Look, is it the other one?

300
01:05:52,809 --> 01:05:56,599
I can't get that.

301
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:00,789
Shit. Am I crazy here?

302
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,170
No, I'm not crazy.

303
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,840
I'm not crazy.

304
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,420
I told you I wasn't crazy.

305
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,769
Is there another one?

306
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:18,519
Now I got to use this.

307
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:25,510
No. What tool?

308
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:33,460
That's a tiny little screw.

309
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,500
I didn't think I was going to need this.

310
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:40,219
All right. There's another one here.

311
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:41,500
Oh, okay. That comes off.

312
01:06:42,519 --> 01:06:43,960
Beautiful. Then this thing's going to come out.

313
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:51,000
Snip those.

314
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:55,369
All right. Get in there.

315
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,929
Snip these with the pliers.

316
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,599
That felt fantastic to do that.

317
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:08,550
I'm not even kidding.

318
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:10,309
I'm not even messing around.

319
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:14,860
That felt so...

320
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:15,739
I'm not even kidding.

321
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:22,579
Okay. There goes those.

322
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:26,469
This whole thing.

323
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:30,489
Oh, that's the dirty part.

324
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:34,840
Oh, shit.

325
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,039
Okay. I might have to deal with that later.

326
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,630
Fuck. 24 parts left.

327
01:07:51,289 --> 01:07:52,090
In what world?

328
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:54,329
What has 24 parts in it?

329
01:07:58,329 --> 01:07:58,730
Ring.

330
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,460
All right. 24.

331
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:12,219
Is this still something I didn't see in here?

332
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:21,180
This whole...

333
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:21,979
Is this going to come out?

334
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,539
Oh, look at these screws.

335
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:38,890
Is there more?

336
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,250
There's another one.

337
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,279
Oh, my God.

338
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:42,600
All right.

339
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,279
So I think this one's done.

340
01:08:45,239 --> 01:08:46,119
Anything else in here?

341
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:50,170
Yeah, there is.

342
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:50,810
Flip it around.

343
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:00,710
No. Which one?

344
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:01,109
Pliers?

345
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:11,189
Guys, I don't know where the other 20-plus pieces are.

346
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:13,560
Am I missing something?

347
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:25,930
Inside the lid.

348
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:39,640
Really? This is so weird.

349
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:46,869
I don't... What?

350
01:09:46,869 --> 01:09:48,229
A wrench?

351
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:49,930
How do I get this out?

352
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,180
All right.

353
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:02,300
What the hell's going on?

354
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:05,350
Hey!

355
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:12,310
Hey!

356
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:22,340
Got it.

357
01:10:23,739 --> 01:10:23,979
No.

358
01:10:25,609 --> 01:10:27,369
Why is it locked shut?

359
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:32,420
Give me my thing.

360
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:41,590
Are there this many things up here?

361
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:42,869
That are...

362
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:47,779
Shit.

363
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,060
No?

364
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:11,300
Hey.

365
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:13,000
Hey!

366
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,560
Hey!

367
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:26,659
How do I get this off?

368
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:35,500
This lid is locked shut.

369
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,619
Six more parts, apparently.

370
01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:44,699
Why can I not get in here?

371
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:46,220
Check the hinge inside the lid.

372
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,300
Yeah, I'm trying to, like, wedge it in there.

373
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:50,789
You think I would be...

374
01:11:50,789 --> 01:11:51,670
I think I fucked it up.

375
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:56,939
This looks like I can move it out, but I can't grab it.

376
01:11:57,739 --> 01:12:04,600
Wait, what's going on?

377
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:08,069
What's going on?

378
01:12:08,069 --> 01:12:11,819
Where's everybody freaking out?

379
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:14,470
Stick your face in there.

380
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,270
I think I may have bugged it.

381
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:19,239
Because this was opening before,

382
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:20,199
and now it's not opening.

383
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:21,319
The hinge is just gone.

384
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:26,350
Ah!

385
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:28,890
It's... Hmm...

386
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,090
What the fuck do I do about this?

387
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,920
I can't grab this lid.

388
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,800
Maybe a crowbar?

389
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:41,510
I gotta pry this thing open.

390
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:48,260
Ah, something ain't right.

391
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:48,979
Something ain't right.

392
01:12:49,939 --> 01:12:51,460
Unfortunately, something's not right.

393
01:12:52,260 --> 01:13:01,670
It's worth a shot.

394
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:05,050
Damn it!

395
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:05,550
No!

396
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:07,979
Oh, the work!

397
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:15,579
Just shoot it.

398
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,880
Turn it off and turn it on.

399
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,680
Use another part.

400
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:21,109
Uh, I'm so curious.

401
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:22,390
Is that the only thing that's left?

402
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,789
I can't use the hammer right now.

403
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:31,609
Okay, there's apparently something right here.

404
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:35,689
What is right here?

405
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:36,810
This thing?

406
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:46,250
I mean, this looks like it's more than one piece, right?

407
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:55,020
Yeah, it's this thing right here.

408
01:13:55,899 --> 01:14:05,579
I can't, like, open this?

409
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,239
Or is it this?

410
01:14:10,789 --> 01:14:11,510
Oh, shit!

411
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,029
It's right there.

412
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,000
What do I need?

413
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,479
Fires?

414
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:26,310
No, not the wrench.

415
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,260
Pliers?

416
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,699
What do I, how do I open this fucking thing?

417
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,289
I can't just grab that?

418
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:41,430
What?

419
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:45,210
Is something holding it?

420
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,979
What is holding this on?

421
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:47,699
Is there a screw?

422
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:58,789
Where's the magnifying glass?

423
01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:00,229
Where, what am I missing here?

424
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:03,590
Look, I think there's a,

425
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:05,989
there's a tiny, oh my god.

426
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:08,359
Ah, Jesus.

427
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:14,310
Okay, don't shoot it.

428
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,270
Look at this little screw.

429
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:20,180
Hey, hey, blink and you'll miss it.

430
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:23,609
Is that the regular screwdriver?

431
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:30,680
All right, who's that?

432
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,640
How many more?

433
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,760
Four pieces left.

434
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,340
Shit, really?

435
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:40,779
This maybe?

436
01:15:45,529 --> 01:15:46,819
All right, let's see.

437
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:52,340
Shit.

438
01:15:54,739 --> 01:15:55,779
I might have to shoot this.

439
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:04,810
Damn it!

440
01:16:05,369 --> 01:16:07,340
What about, is it, maybe it's behind it?

441
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,930
No, come on.

442
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:17,210
I have to ruin the level.

443
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:22,340
Just glitch out with it?

444
01:16:22,899 --> 01:16:24,220
Not a bad idea.

445
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:16,680
Open the lid!

446
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,560
Fuck!

447
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,000
Now the level's ruined.

448
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:29,140
I've disappointed.

449
01:17:34,869 --> 01:17:36,789
You don't get a check if you don't do it right.

450
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:37,909
God damn it, really.

451
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,000
A phone, a jigsaw.

452
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:45,640
Let's do the car.

453
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:49,930
This is a real car.

454
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:54,729
Okay.

455
01:17:54,729 --> 01:17:58,819
How many parts?

456
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,539
103.

457
01:18:02,539 --> 01:18:03,579
Cool, cool, look at that.

458
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:04,460
Oh, this is a manual.

459
01:18:05,659 --> 01:18:06,380
Nice seats.

460
01:18:06,939 --> 01:18:09,880
Let's get everybody in here.

461
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:25,960
That's fine.

462
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:45,100
Road trip.

463
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:55,430
There's too many people in the car.

464
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,630
It's the clown car.

465
01:18:57,189 --> 01:19:10,710
Hey, can you move back a little?

466
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:11,510
He's, all right.

467
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,430
Can you at least go out the other window?

468
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:16,819
That's, whatever.

469
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:18,260
All right, I need to get in there and drive it.

470
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:30,579
This is like a subway.

471
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,340
Like, oh, Jesus.

472
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,050
This, ding, ding, ding.

473
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,689
No, you get, oh, don't cough on me.

474
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:38,329
God.

475
01:19:38,329 --> 01:19:41,579
All right, that's good.

476
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:43,979
Let's give it a try.

477
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:48,409
Oh, is this some kind of a car engine thing?

478
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:52,659
All right, shut up back there.

479
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:14,380
This is like nobody.

480
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,760
Get the fuck, man.

481
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,840
Even when I'm sitting down,

482
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,800
you're like caught up your ass.

483
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:28,170
All right, here we go.

484
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:30,819
Can I beep?

485
01:20:30,819 --> 01:20:35,699
Can I turn on the radio?

486
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,470
Where are we?

487
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,380
The clowns!

488
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,539
Get them out, quick.

489
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:50,760
Out the back.

490
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,319
Save them.

491
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:55,130
All right, let me go back.

492
01:21:55,130 --> 01:22:05,510
This is cool, though.

493
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:11,989
I like sitting in here.

494
01:22:11,989 --> 01:22:13,989
All right, should I load up with clowns

495
01:22:13,989 --> 01:22:15,430
and play clown music in the background?

496
01:22:15,989 --> 01:22:17,590
And then like just drive them?

497
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:25,539
Maybe like, let's go with 50.

498
01:22:25,539 --> 01:22:27,720
And my computer might crash.

499
01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:34,970
Stream's probably gonna turn off.

500
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:36,489
I gotta place them perfectly, though.

501
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:49,079
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

502
01:22:50,409 --> 01:22:52,489
Eight, nine.

503
01:22:52,489 --> 01:23:11,159
I feel like I'm hiding in a bunch of stuffed animals.

504
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,720
You're not gonna find me.

505
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:23,989
I lost count.

506
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:43,079
I don't even know how many are in here.

507
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:46,420
Is everybody counting?

508
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:46,920
Jesus.

509
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:49,689
My computer, that's it.

510
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:50,649
No, that's it.

511
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:50,890
That's it.

512
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:51,770
My computer's gonna break.

513
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,140
Oh, God, that's it.

514
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:56,939
I can feel it already.

515
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:00,329
That's 42.

516
01:24:00,329 --> 01:24:02,789
Oh, eight more?

517
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:15,449
I can't do that.

518
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:16,649
We need 50.

519
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:24,890
The stream's going to turn off.

520
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:30,649
Funny clown music loop.

521
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:31,449
That's not a good one.

522
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:38,789
Come on, what's like circus music?

523
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:43,770
Am I gonna like upload one of these?

524
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:44,489
Should I make one?

525
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:55,899
This is circus music.

526
01:24:57,909 --> 01:25:07,859
Okay, here we go.

527
01:25:07,859 --> 01:25:08,359
Ready?

528
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:23,539
What happened to the music?

529
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:36,310
I'm running over the cord.

530
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:43,029
That was weird.

531
01:27:43,029 --> 01:27:47,939
All right, I need to take this apart.

532
01:27:47,939 --> 01:27:49,140
I gotta do this for real.

533
01:27:49,140 --> 01:28:01,380
Jesus Christ.

534
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,489
That's too many mannequins.

535
01:28:04,489 --> 01:28:23,739
I wonder what's gonna happen to all this wood.

536
01:28:23,739 --> 01:28:25,659
I'll see you guys when I stream next.

537
01:28:26,939 --> 01:28:28,710
I didn't do anything.

538
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,029
Never mind.

539
01:28:29,029 --> 01:28:29,529
Move on.

540
01:28:29,989 --> 01:28:32,439
We're good to go.

541
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:36,739
I restart this before my video card dies.

542
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:42,180
All right, let's get it.

543
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:42,899
Let's take it apart.

544
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:47,689
All right.

545
01:28:49,899 --> 01:28:50,619
How many parts?

546
01:28:50,619 --> 01:28:51,659
103.

547
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:55,210
This should be fun.

548
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:55,770
Nice hair.

549
01:28:56,489 --> 01:29:00,789
Does my hair get fucked up?

550
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:11,800
Get in there and stay in there before I get angry.

551
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,489
Does the mirror come out?

552
01:29:14,489 --> 01:29:14,890
It does.

553
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:19,210
Tires.

554
01:29:23,449 --> 01:29:25,609
I don't think you can do that with a car.

555
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:36,979
That's it for the door, right?

556
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,560
You can't do that either.

557
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,680
That's true.

558
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,319
Or this.

559
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:59,670
Are you serious?

560
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:00,550
I can't lift it with this.

561
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:04,979
No one is making my life hard.

562
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:13,020
Physics damage on the car.

563
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,739
Impressive.

564
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,619
God damn it.

565
01:30:21,619 --> 01:30:22,100
I was gonna...

566
01:30:22,659 --> 01:30:32,439
This is what a windshield is like, huh?

567
01:30:32,439 --> 01:30:33,899
Okay, ready?

568
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,460
Whoa, underneath.

569
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,939
I was trying...

570
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:51,659
Never mind.

571
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:56,890
Do I need to pull this?

572
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:57,449
That...

573
01:30:57,449 --> 01:30:58,810
All right, that doesn't break.

574
01:30:58,810 --> 01:30:59,779
Let's get onto the hood.

575
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:13,050
All right, turn it on.

576
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:16,539
Let me see if I can find out what the problem is.

577
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:21,960
Yeah.

578
01:31:24,069 --> 01:31:31,609
Let me get a better look.

579
01:31:31,609 --> 01:31:32,890
I think it might be the battery.

580
01:31:37,479 --> 01:31:39,319
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

581
01:31:39,319 --> 01:31:41,560
Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

582
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,439
Oh, I'm sorry.

583
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,800
Give me some juice.

584
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:53,430
Ah, no, it's not the battery.

585
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:56,060
I think it's the radiator.

586
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,579
Oh, oh, hot, hot, hot.

587
01:31:58,619 --> 01:31:59,180
Okay.

588
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,300
No more hot joke.

589
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:05,430
How is this still on?

590
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:10,920
There's no way it's still on.

591
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:20,539
There's no way this is still on.

592
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,550
Somebody getting in.

593
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:33,670
Let me get in there and see.

594
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:38,149
Yeah, it looks like there's a couple of issues here with your glue gun.

595
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:45,659
Um, what did I just do?

596
01:32:46,539 --> 01:32:50,069
Oh, that's the...

597
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:52,869
Oh, this is where you pilot the car.

598
01:32:52,869 --> 01:32:53,189
Right.

599
01:32:53,989 --> 01:32:54,789
What the fuck?

600
01:32:55,750 --> 01:33:04,970
I think that's it.

601
01:33:05,529 --> 01:33:06,649
Did the dash come out?

602
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:11,770
I want to see if the car will still run after all this.

603
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:14,250
Oh, a crystal.

604
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:18,300
Blue crystal.

605
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:27,260
A dragon egg.

606
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:40,810
All right, I'm going to have to get some tools here in a second.

607
01:33:41,609 --> 01:33:50,939
Wait.

608
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,119
Ah, hold on.

609
01:34:32,119 --> 01:34:33,319
Why did that?

610
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,960
I can't back it up.

611
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:38,840
This is fucking Nintendo Labo.

612
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,250
Oh, broke my headline.

613
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:42,649
Oh, no.

614
01:34:43,369 --> 01:34:45,659
Jesus Christ.

615
01:34:59,430 --> 01:34:59,750
Get...

616
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:06,409
I need to get a glass.

617
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:19,720
That worked.

618
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,949
Get the back fin here.

619
01:35:22,949 --> 01:35:25,819
What have we got?

620
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:26,939
72 more parts.

621
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:28,460
Holy God, are you kidding me?

622
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,340
Wait, did I fail it?

623
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:30,619
No.

624
01:35:30,619 --> 01:35:32,699
Okay, I didn't know if it exploded was a fail.

625
01:35:38,869 --> 01:35:41,270
Anything more to the seats besides just the seat?

626
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:46,760
Nice, like, gamer chair.

627
01:35:47,319 --> 01:35:52,220
Wait a minute.

628
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:55,500
Is a gamer chair just a car chair?

629
01:35:59,060 --> 01:35:59,460
It is.

630
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:07,380
What?

631
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:10,279
It is, isn't it?

632
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,260
Okay.

633
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:22,460
All right, down here.

634
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:24,619
All right, I'm going to have to stand up for the next few

635
01:36:24,619 --> 01:36:27,020
because I'm actually getting motion sick sitting here doing this.

636
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:31,140
After we're done with the car, I'm going to have to stretch

637
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:32,500
and I'm going to stand up and move the camera

638
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,699
because I'm actually going to throw up.

639
01:36:34,659 --> 01:36:35,380
It's just like this...

640
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:38,729
Oh, no, I got to get up.

641
01:36:40,279 --> 01:36:41,479
I got to get out of this chair.

642
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,399
Movement without movement is just...

643
01:36:48,439 --> 01:36:49,000
You're going to hurl.

644
01:36:54,789 --> 01:36:55,829
And plus, this is like...

645
01:36:56,869 --> 01:37:00,470
I'm spinning around and coiling myself up like a snake.

646
01:37:01,189 --> 01:37:13,619
Get this out of here.

647
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:21,539
Both mufflers?

648
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:23,109
Goodbye?

649
01:37:23,829 --> 01:37:28,340
I think I got to unscrew some shit.

650
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:30,840
I think so.

651
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:35,109
Can I move the car back?

652
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:37,640
All right, no, I got to stand up.

653
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:43,460
Hold on.

654
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:44,739
I'm going to puke.

655
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:49,109
I'm going back to standing.

656
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:55,670
This is a failed experiment.

657
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:57,029
Okay.

658
01:37:57,029 --> 01:37:57,989
All right.

659
01:37:57,989 --> 01:38:18,729
I'm going to move the camera.

660
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:21,939
Yeah, I got to move around.

661
01:38:21,939 --> 01:38:27,189
How are we looking?

662
01:38:27,189 --> 01:38:27,989
That's all right.

663
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:37,689
Maybe a little bit lower.

664
01:38:37,689 --> 01:38:42,489
Maybe a whole sleeve of Oreos will make you feel better.

665
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:44,010
That's not a bad fucking idea.

666
01:38:44,489 --> 01:38:45,529
That's not a bad idea.

667
01:38:45,529 --> 01:38:48,579
Like an entire sleeve?

668
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,739
A little bit more head room.

669
01:38:58,119 --> 01:38:59,399
All right, let's get untangled.

670
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:02,710
This, I feel better already from standing up.

671
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,510
Good.

672
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:04,149
Very good.

673
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:10,470
It's a bit?

674
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:10,869
What's a bit?

675
01:39:10,869 --> 01:39:25,340
I'm not joking.

676
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,189
Do you think I'm joking?

677
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:29,029
No, I'm holding back puke.

678
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:31,000
I'm kidding.

679
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,560
I'm kidding.

680
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,039
I'm kidding.

681
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:39,619
Ah!

682
01:39:39,619 --> 01:39:40,579
All right.

683
01:39:40,579 --> 01:39:42,500
Better.

684
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,779
Let's keep doing this shit.

685
01:39:43,779 --> 01:39:44,520
I feel better now.

686
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,079
Already.

687
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:46,470
Better already.

688
01:39:47,189 --> 01:39:48,470
I don't even know what I picked up.

689
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:57,100
Let's get this shit out.

690
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:09,689
So this is a, uh, this is a, no, wrench.

691
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:14,819
No, wrench.

692
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:16,539
Wrench, right?

693
01:40:16,539 --> 01:40:17,180
Get back here.

694
01:40:17,979 --> 01:40:20,260
Flyers or wrench?

695
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:20,579
Wrench.

696
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:28,170
Can I do it with flyers?

697
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:28,409
No.

698
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:38,039
Upcap.

699
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:47,289
I think I need the, uh, yeah, I need the, although sitting down, you don't do that.

700
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:51,800
It's a brake lock.

701
01:40:53,319 --> 01:40:58,300
Nice.

702
01:41:04,869 --> 01:41:07,029
Give me the, uh, give me the, uh, yeah.

703
01:41:07,029 --> 01:41:11,689
Down with you.

704
01:41:11,689 --> 01:41:12,890
I think that's it with here.

705
01:41:14,199 --> 01:41:14,840
Oh my God.

706
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:15,479
What's going on?

707
01:41:16,119 --> 01:41:18,569
People giving community subs?

708
01:41:20,119 --> 01:41:21,399
Uh, pixel bike.

709
01:41:21,399 --> 01:41:22,680
Thanks for five community subs.

710
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,039
There was another one before that I missed.

711
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:27,020
Big subs.

712
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:27,739
Thanks a lot, guys.

713
01:41:30,279 --> 01:41:33,909
I missed, uh, probably a couple that came in, but thank you.

714
01:41:39,689 --> 01:41:40,649
Oh, Pogchamp.

715
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:42,729
No, thanks a lot, guys.

716
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:46,659
More community subs coming in.

717
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,409
That's what I wanted.

718
01:41:52,409 --> 01:42:03,340
Throw it off.

719
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:06,569
These can come off now.

720
01:42:06,569 --> 01:42:09,479
All right, now we're just down to, like, the meat of the car.

721
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:15,670
Dude, why, why doesn't, like, the gamer chair companies make this?

722
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:19,829
It's a double gamer chair.

723
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:23,739
Do they make this?

724
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:27,369
A gamer couch.

725
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:36,460
A gamer couch.

726
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:41,579
Uh, what else is free?

727
01:42:41,579 --> 01:42:42,060
Anything else?

728
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:43,020
I got to just do the tires.

729
01:42:43,989 --> 01:42:45,430
Uh, do all four tires.

730
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:46,069
Get it over with.

731
01:42:55,289 --> 01:42:58,420
Wink.

732
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:02,380
I use the crowbar.

733
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:04,890
Pull the shit up.

734
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:09,560
Brake pad.

735
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:15,100
Uh, it's a turn device.

736
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:15,659
Whatever it is.

737
01:43:17,529 --> 01:43:19,609
Now, how do we get this shit off?

738
01:43:20,409 --> 01:43:23,829
A wrench for that one?

739
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:27,479
Is this connected to something?

740
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:32,340
I'm not sure what this is exactly connected to.

741
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:33,460
I think I have to get rid of this first.

742
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,060
I think.

743
01:43:36,699 --> 01:43:38,869
Let's find out.

744
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:43,930
Hmm.

745
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:46,520
Shit.

746
01:43:51,289 --> 01:43:52,250
Is there a screw here?

747
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:54,760
I don't think so.

748
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,359
I think it's just wedged in up here.

749
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:03,369
Crowbar?

750
01:44:04,069 --> 01:44:09,720
I don't know.

751
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:10,220
Chainsaw.

752
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,420
Uh, I'm gonna flip the car upside down.

753
01:44:21,739 --> 01:44:26,310
What's that?

754
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:27,829
Why is there, like, why is it leaking?

755
01:44:28,869 --> 01:44:30,310
All right, this is connected to here.

756
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:34,840
There we go.

757
01:44:35,989 --> 01:44:37,109
Can I pull these off?

758
01:44:37,109 --> 01:44:37,590
Yeah, I can.

759
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,800
No, I cannot.

760
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:48,300
Said tool required.

761
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:53,590
Maybe not.

762
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:57,130
We'll find out later.

763
01:44:57,130 --> 01:45:01,380
I think I can rip this out with the wrench.

764
01:45:02,489 --> 01:45:03,210
No.

765
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:07,369
All right, let's go for gold here.

766
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:09,390
Never mind.

767
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:19,850
Will you please just pick it up?

768
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:22,970
I'm about to do it lefty.

769
01:45:24,229 --> 01:45:26,149
You ever see somebody hold out javelin like this?

770
01:45:26,869 --> 01:45:37,750
Just get away from me, please!

771
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:48,710
All right, tool to rip this off.

772
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:49,210
Got it.

773
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:55,449
I can pull these up now.

774
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:56,890
Very nice.

775
01:46:00,619 --> 01:46:02,460
This is bolted somehow.

776
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:02,960
Or is it?

777
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:07,930
Okay, I did think I was gonna be able to do that.

778
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:11,619
All right, now I can flip it back around.

779
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:19,220
What's left?

780
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,260
33 pieces.

781
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:21,619
I might have to take the whole engine apart.

782
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:35,529
All right, this is the, this is the orbit.

783
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:36,890
This is the tuba.

784
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:40,899
Okay, don't tell me you didn't blow into the top of that thing.

785
01:46:40,899 --> 01:46:42,819
It wouldn't make like four separate weird noises.

786
01:46:47,779 --> 01:46:53,399
You can probably harmonize with that thing with one note.

787
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:58,359
All right, engine.

788
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,119
Engine is detached.

789
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,220
So it's a big staple.

790
01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:04,550
Now, here we go.

791
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:11,079
I think there's more to meets the eye here with this thing.

792
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:13,689
Maybe not.

793
01:47:20,789 --> 01:47:21,289
Tires.

794
01:47:21,829 --> 01:47:26,100
And then we gotta go searching for the next little bit here.

795
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:32,659
In a minute.

796
01:47:32,659 --> 01:47:39,619
Oh, I got the turkey leg.

797
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:47,130
That's it.

798
01:47:48,409 --> 01:47:50,180
The meowing engine.

799
01:47:50,819 --> 01:47:51,539
Is it meowing?

800
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:58,010
All right, only a few more things left, I think.

801
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:59,609
Yeah, we're down to like the last little bit here.

802
01:48:00,329 --> 01:48:06,149
It's the two tires.

803
01:48:09,829 --> 01:48:10,329
Lovely.

804
01:48:10,949 --> 01:48:16,149
You can get that off.

805
01:48:16,149 --> 01:48:18,390
Does this have to, does this come apart?

806
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:20,869
Oh shit, it does.

807
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:21,750
I don't even know if this is.

808
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:25,350
How would you go back together?

809
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:28,869
Oh my god.

810
01:48:29,979 --> 01:48:30,779
Get out of my way.

811
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:41,020
There's the, there's the rumor.

812
01:48:41,579 --> 01:48:42,760
All right, here we go.

813
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,399
Yeah, this is it.

814
01:48:43,399 --> 01:48:44,279
I got it.

815
01:48:44,279 --> 01:48:44,779
Victory.

816
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,539
And other tire right here.

817
01:48:53,689 --> 01:48:56,149
Finally took long enough.

818
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:00,630
19 minutes.

819
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,260
We did it, Reddit.

820
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:11,159
We did it, Reddit.

821
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:12,789
All right, what else we got?

822
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:14,550
It's Titanic.

823
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:19,239
Car, airplane, toaster, coffee grinder.

824
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:22,939
Train, deep tank.

825
01:49:23,739 --> 01:49:30,039
I kind of want to, what do you think?

826
01:49:31,699 --> 01:49:32,979
Go back to the Titanic.

827
01:49:33,539 --> 01:49:40,220
I need to like stretch.

828
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:42,619
My body is so broken.

829
01:49:44,649 --> 01:49:45,149
All right.

830
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:53,340
How do I, okay, I'm going to say like we're going to pull the bottom out.

831
01:49:53,899 --> 01:49:57,340
I think that's the most reliable.

832
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,300
Just rip the bottom out.

833
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:01,500
Just take the napkin from underneath all the shit and it'll all fall down.

834
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:04,029
Watch this.

835
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:13,369
Down, down, down, down, down.

836
01:50:13,369 --> 01:50:16,970
And what is in here?

837
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:18,250
Is it like the engine room?

838
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:19,369
All right, I'm going to take the bottom.

839
01:50:19,369 --> 01:50:20,489
I'm just going to pull the bottom out.

840
01:50:21,289 --> 01:50:23,850
I'm just going to take one piece.

841
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:28,039
Right like down here.

842
01:50:28,039 --> 01:50:29,079
I'm just going to rip the whole thing.

843
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:30,380
Ready?

844
01:50:38,329 --> 01:50:38,829
Almost.

845
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:47,539
Fucking explosions, man.

846
01:50:47,539 --> 01:50:48,579
They're so intense.

847
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,380
It's that easy.

848
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:58,460
Or is it?

849
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:02,680
I might have to go to the bottom of the ocean and clean this and rip these apart.

850
01:51:03,319 --> 01:51:08,840
Well, that would be a pain in the ass, wouldn't it?

851
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:15,750
God damn it.

852
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:21,300
I got to turn the thing on.

853
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:22,260
That makes me move faster.

854
01:51:22,739 --> 01:51:27,770
This bubble's just too big.

855
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:34,869
Damn it, it's like a gunshot.

856
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:45,609
Pick it up.

857
01:51:45,609 --> 01:51:46,489
Grab it, grab it, grab it.

858
01:51:48,489 --> 01:51:50,970
Now, I don't know if I'm going to be able to...

859
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:52,409
This is going to take so long.

860
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:57,020
How would you not do...

861
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:59,500
How would you do this without like a fucking grenade?

862
01:52:00,619 --> 01:52:05,850
Oh, 144 parts.

863
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:08,970
I got to go in and disassemble every stool.

864
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:13,479
Oh, there it goes.

865
01:52:14,199 --> 01:52:22,729
143.

866
01:52:22,729 --> 01:52:23,289
What's it going to do?

867
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:40,039
I got to go in and take out everything.

868
01:52:40,039 --> 01:52:49,180
All right, give me the super speed.

869
01:52:50,939 --> 01:52:58,970
This is going to take forever.

870
01:53:00,010 --> 01:53:03,659
Because the thing is, if you try to destroy it one little piece at a time, it just explodes.

871
01:53:03,659 --> 01:53:05,659
It just goes like, boom!

872
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:21,109
I'm just like an anime character blasting through this.

873
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:29,079
And here we go!

874
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:43,699
I'm just going to go through the middle.

875
01:53:43,699 --> 01:53:44,500
Watch this, ready?

876
01:53:45,539 --> 01:53:46,340
I think I did it.

877
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:55,750
Kind of.

878
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:56,310
Fuck.

879
01:53:56,789 --> 01:53:57,670
Kind of.

880
01:53:57,670 --> 01:54:00,890
Fuck.

881
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:10,420
Here we go.

882
01:54:38,229 --> 01:54:39,189
Sorry!

883
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:41,850
I can't stop!

884
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:47,770
Oh!

885
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:49,380
Can it be done?

886
01:55:01,579 --> 01:55:03,979
Oh my god, I have 109.

887
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:18,979
I'm going to explode.

888
01:55:19,699 --> 01:55:26,199
I am never going to be able to do this.

889
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:29,800
Would you touch anything?

890
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,420
I'm going to destroy these things.

891
01:55:35,289 --> 01:55:35,850
No, I'm not!

892
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:38,729
Oh, it's taking like 20 minutes when I make my way over there.

893
01:55:55,670 --> 01:56:03,619
No, just gravity gun.

894
01:56:09,989 --> 01:56:11,590
It's just, it's too wedged in.

895
01:56:12,229 --> 01:56:22,470
All right, fuck it.

896
01:56:23,590 --> 01:56:24,470
I can't do this one.

897
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:26,310
It's going to take like two hours to do this.

898
01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:28,979
I'm just going to suck it up.

899
01:56:44,260 --> 01:57:06,970
I feel like I'm in the middle of that mission in Half-Life when you first

900
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:11,640
roll the cart into the electromagnetic spectrum thing.

901
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:19,850
This is 70 more times.

902
01:57:56,579 --> 01:58:11,930
All right, I can't, I'm done.

903
01:58:12,569 --> 01:58:16,069
I'm done.

904
01:58:16,069 --> 01:58:17,689
I did it.

905
01:58:17,689 --> 01:58:18,010
I'm done.

906
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:27,619
This is going to actually be the same.

907
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:39,859
I have no idea where these other 24 pieces are.

908
01:58:49,529 --> 01:58:51,689
I know they could be anywhere.

909
01:58:51,689 --> 01:58:57,189
It's 21.

910
01:58:57,189 --> 01:58:58,069
I think it could be anywhere.

911
01:58:58,069 --> 01:58:59,430
It could be any one of these.

912
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:18,380
It's 21 still!

913
01:59:22,039 --> 01:59:23,079
It's not possible.

914
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,100
Where is the other piece?

915
01:59:33,979 --> 01:59:50,250
Is there any more?

916
01:59:53,989 --> 01:59:54,630
Does this count?

917
02:00:25,619 --> 02:00:30,310
Okay, that's it.

918
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:31,109
I'm sorry.

919
02:00:31,109 --> 02:00:31,989
I don't care.

920
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:34,710
I don't care if I get a heart attack on this one.

921
02:00:36,659 --> 02:00:38,500
My like psyche is going to break down.

922
02:00:58,659 --> 02:01:09,369
No, no, no, what are you doing?

923
02:01:09,369 --> 02:01:10,010
No!

924
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:12,659
That's not what I wanted.

925
02:01:15,449 --> 02:01:20,949
Why is this killing me so much?

926
02:01:21,510 --> 02:01:29,619
Now give me a headache.

927
02:01:29,619 --> 02:01:32,180
Imagine the guy in the inside.

928
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:35,590
I got a headache.

929
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:37,779
Oh, it's like times 10 headache.

930
02:01:37,779 --> 02:01:47,050
My friend says you have a long plantain face.

931
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:49,260
Oh, good.

932
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,020
Isn't it fucking chiseled?

933
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:53,340
I just chiseled plantain.

934
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:57,340
I don't even know what that means.

935
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:03,420
I can't do mind show right now.

936
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:03,819
I'm going to...

937
02:02:05,979 --> 02:02:06,619
Fuck.

938
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:11,829
These VR streams are fucking killing me.

939
02:02:11,829 --> 02:02:15,590
It's like every day I lose.

940
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:20,460
Every day I lose a little more energy.

941
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:23,909
Doing it like two or three times in a row.

942
02:02:23,909 --> 02:02:25,189
It's so fun though.

943
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:27,720
I think I can do a couple...

944
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:28,520
Hold on.

945
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:34,359
Plantain's a banana.

946
02:02:34,359 --> 02:02:36,409
Oh, whatever.

947
02:02:36,409 --> 02:02:37,449
I've got like a banana face.

948
02:02:37,449 --> 02:02:37,850
That's fine.

949
02:02:41,739 --> 02:02:43,020
I want to keep playing that.

950
02:02:43,579 --> 02:02:48,199
I thought bringing the chair in was going to help.

951
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:50,279
I'll bring a chair in and sit out

952
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:52,619
and feel like I'm going to throw up.

953
02:02:52,699 --> 02:02:54,390
It's all right.

954
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:55,430
I just need a second.

955
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:56,069
We'll go back in.

956
02:03:00,149 --> 02:03:01,420
Where's my library?

957
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:06,060
All right.

958
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:09,100
What happened to it?

959
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:10,949
There it is.

960
02:03:10,949 --> 02:03:11,189
Okay.

961
02:03:11,189 --> 02:03:11,590
Let's go.

962
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:27,000
There comes a puking stream.

963
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,880
Nah, it was just zooming in really fast.

964
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:31,399
Sitting down in the chair.

965
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,960
Blade and Sorcery got a big update.

966
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,760
Maybe we'll check it out.

967
02:03:47,699 --> 02:03:47,939
All right.

968
02:03:47,939 --> 02:03:48,579
Let me get in here.

969
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:50,739
Let's do the computer.

970
02:03:50,739 --> 02:03:51,619
The computer sounds fun.

971
02:03:58,149 --> 02:03:58,869
I'm going to be honest.

972
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,659
Any next game in VR is going to be like

973
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:04,260
Blade and Sorcery.

974
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:06,260
I have to fucking move around and swing around.

975
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:10,550
I might not be able to do that for very long.

976
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:14,420
I'm getting like that fucking like puke reflex.

977
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:20,149
It's from sitting down.

978
02:04:20,149 --> 02:04:22,310
And you know when you like get that after a while,

979
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:24,710
you get that feeling and then like you can't get rid of it.

980
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:29,560
Getting up made it better.

981
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:30,119
And then like there.

982
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:34,359
Oh my God.

983
02:04:34,359 --> 02:04:35,800
I was being just attacked.

984
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:41,619
Let's do the computer.

985
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:47,159
Drone, TV, submarine.

986
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:48,199
Some of these are so fun.

987
02:04:49,779 --> 02:04:50,340
Microwave.

988
02:04:59,239 --> 02:05:00,199
What is happening here?

989
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:08,170
Something is not right.

990
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:12,149
That's odd.

991
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:25,079
Is it like the pizza?

992
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:30,600
Did I fry my GPU?

993
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:32,220
I don't think so.

994
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:32,539
Hold on.

995
02:05:34,789 --> 02:05:35,350
Oh no.

996
02:05:40,819 --> 02:05:41,460
Oh no.

997
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:43,380
Oh no.

998
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:46,340
Now wait.

999
02:05:49,739 --> 02:05:50,060
Fixed.

1000
02:05:50,779 --> 02:05:51,180
We're good.

1001
02:05:54,069 --> 02:05:55,109
The window wasn't in focus.

1002
02:05:57,210 --> 02:05:57,850
Weirdly enough.

1003
02:05:58,409 --> 02:06:02,659
All right.

1004
02:06:02,659 --> 02:06:04,260
So let's do microwave.

1005
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:06,970
We've got 113 pieces.

1006
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:07,289
Let's see.

1007
02:06:07,289 --> 02:06:08,489
Let's cook something.

1008
02:06:08,489 --> 02:06:34,890
You're not supposed to put metal in the microwave.

1009
02:06:41,579 --> 02:06:42,779
Why is it not doing anything?

1010
02:06:55,500 --> 02:07:08,739
We're going to eat good tonight.

1011
02:07:08,739 --> 02:07:43,270
I can't put my head in here.

1012
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:49,859
Okay.

1013
02:07:51,050 --> 02:07:51,609
Jesus.

1014
02:07:51,609 --> 02:07:51,850
All right.

1015
02:07:51,850 --> 02:07:52,489
Let's try it again.

1016
02:08:04,659 --> 02:08:08,100
Why is everything so fragile in this game?

1017
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:08,500
Seriously.

1018
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:08,979
Look at this.

1019
02:08:08,979 --> 02:08:09,460
Ready?

1020
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:09,939
Watch this.

1021
02:08:12,569 --> 02:08:14,409
It's just a piece of lettuce.

1022
02:08:14,409 --> 02:08:15,699
There's a piece of lettuce.

1023
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:18,579
Well, the plating is very important.

1024
02:08:18,579 --> 02:08:21,060
You've got to make sure you put your greens

1025
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:22,819
right gently on the plate.

1026
02:08:22,819 --> 02:08:23,539
Oh, whoops.

1027
02:08:23,539 --> 02:08:24,500
It fucking broke.

1028
02:08:44,039 --> 02:08:45,159
Just restart it.

1029
02:08:45,159 --> 02:08:47,449
God damn it.

1030
02:08:47,449 --> 02:08:49,460
All right.

1031
02:08:49,460 --> 02:08:50,260
Forget about this.

1032
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:51,300
We're going to open it up.

1033
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:53,220
What does the microwave even look like inside?

1034
02:08:53,939 --> 02:08:55,510
Probably scary.

1035
02:08:56,229 --> 02:08:59,289
How terrifying is a microwave?

1036
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:02,439
Microwave the gun.

1037
02:09:24,149 --> 02:09:24,630
I did it.

1038
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:27,750
The door wasn't shut all the way.

1039
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:38,500
Hold on.

1040
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:54,970
Cooking with Jerma.

1041
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:55,289
What?

1042
02:09:55,850 --> 02:10:02,600
I guess I'll have a pizza.

1043
02:10:04,699 --> 02:10:05,659
Oh, it broke.

1044
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:11,460
What's going on?

1045
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:19,369
All right.

1046
02:10:19,369 --> 02:10:24,739
I'm going to do it for real this time.

1047
02:10:24,739 --> 02:10:26,020
I broke the pizza.

1048
02:10:27,829 --> 02:10:28,149
All right.

1049
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:32,489
Panel, door, back panel.

1050
02:10:32,489 --> 02:10:37,140
Can I get this again?

1051
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:37,939
I got screws here.

1052
02:10:38,899 --> 02:10:42,920
Oh, I'm going to move way too fast.

1053
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:48,949
There we go.

1054
02:10:48,949 --> 02:10:51,189
This little room, you can't go that fast.

1055
02:10:51,189 --> 02:10:52,550
So let's open this up.

1056
02:11:05,029 --> 02:11:05,909
This one's going to be cool.

1057
02:11:06,630 --> 02:11:06,949
All right.

1058
02:11:07,909 --> 02:11:09,350
Can I get this back panel off?

1059
02:11:10,649 --> 02:11:10,810
No.

1060
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:11,689
How do I get that down?

1061
02:11:19,109 --> 02:11:19,350
No.

1062
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:20,869
Hold on.

1063
02:11:20,869 --> 02:11:21,350
Uh-oh.

1064
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:46,310
Wait, wait, wait.

1065
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:46,949
Cool.

1066
02:11:46,949 --> 02:11:47,909
That's it for the panel.

1067
02:11:52,779 --> 02:11:53,260
Holy shit.

1068
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:53,899
That's what it looks like.

1069
02:11:54,539 --> 02:11:55,590
What a weird machine.

1070
02:11:56,229 --> 02:12:03,430
Can I get that screw?

1071
02:12:04,149 --> 02:12:06,470
I can get that screw.

1072
02:12:07,029 --> 02:12:20,810
Is this top not going to come off?

1073
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:21,609
I got to cut these.

1074
02:12:24,649 --> 02:12:25,689
Get that off here now.

1075
02:12:27,130 --> 02:12:27,770
Oh, shit.

1076
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:28,250
Oh, shit.

1077
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:29,289
What did I do?

1078
02:12:29,289 --> 02:12:30,710
Oh, my God.

1079
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:31,189
What's happening?

1080
02:12:35,020 --> 02:12:35,899
Oh, it was the glass.

1081
02:12:39,529 --> 02:12:41,770
All right.

1082
02:12:42,819 --> 02:12:43,619
Broke right in half.

1083
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:47,029
Can I get this one out too?

1084
02:12:47,829 --> 02:12:50,170
I don't think I have to.

1085
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:53,619
Play it out of there.

1086
02:13:00,489 --> 02:13:01,529
Why does it have to load this?

1087
02:13:02,970 --> 02:13:05,880
I'm going to just get out of here.

1088
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:11,500
This little thing here.

1089
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:14,409
I think I got to take all these off, don't I?

1090
02:13:14,409 --> 02:13:14,970
Yes, I do.

1091
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:26,100
Really?

1092
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:26,819
Come on.

1093
02:13:26,819 --> 02:13:41,210
Does this still work?

1094
02:13:41,210 --> 02:13:42,010
Does this still turn on?

1095
02:13:45,239 --> 02:13:46,760
The door's not on it, so it won't work.

1096
02:13:52,779 --> 02:13:54,060
Might need it later.

1097
02:13:54,060 --> 02:14:01,500
What the fuck is this?

1098
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:02,859
A bulb?

1099
02:14:03,739 --> 02:14:04,140
Oops.

1100
02:14:04,699 --> 02:14:05,529
Whatever.

1101
02:14:05,529 --> 02:14:07,050
Somebody will clean that up later.

1102
02:14:10,180 --> 02:14:19,239
Every time I go like this, I want you to edit a lightning strike.

1103
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:27,819
Hmm.

1104
02:14:27,819 --> 02:14:33,819
Screws?

1105
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:37,770
No.

1106
02:14:37,770 --> 02:14:38,649
Those screws, right?

1107
02:14:39,289 --> 02:14:55,369
Do I got to flip it?

1108
02:14:55,369 --> 02:14:57,529
I think those little tiny things are right there.

1109
02:14:57,529 --> 02:14:59,960
Shit.

1110
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:07,670
I like the little screwdriver.

1111
02:15:07,670 --> 02:15:14,789
It's never used.

1112
02:15:14,789 --> 02:15:17,270
Only the boss baby one is used.

1113
02:15:17,270 --> 02:15:18,710
I want the little one.

1114
02:15:18,710 --> 02:15:21,689
Let's go back to that.

1115
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:24,060
Give me the pliers.

1116
02:15:24,699 --> 02:15:34,380
I can't get rid of this shit.

1117
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:41,579
Look at this.

1118
02:15:41,579 --> 02:15:49,819
All right.

1119
02:15:49,819 --> 02:15:50,699
A little fan came out.

1120
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:56,470
Can I get this off?

1121
02:16:04,489 --> 02:16:05,289
What was that holding in?

1122
02:16:05,930 --> 02:16:07,539
I was holding this in.

1123
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:10,069
This piece right here, right?

1124
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:17,430
Why can't I get this shit off?

1125
02:16:17,989 --> 02:16:24,300
You figured I could get this off with the pliers.

1126
02:16:31,529 --> 02:16:32,729
I don't even know what that's connected to.

1127
02:16:33,770 --> 02:16:41,159
All right.

1128
02:16:41,159 --> 02:16:41,959
Here we go.

1129
02:16:41,959 --> 02:16:43,940
I got a bunch of straight wires.

1130
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:52,170
Is there a screw?

1131
02:16:56,250 --> 02:16:56,569
Screw?

1132
02:16:57,209 --> 02:17:02,459
Crowbar?

1133
02:17:02,459 --> 02:17:09,129
I think it's too small to put the crowbar in here.

1134
02:17:09,129 --> 02:17:10,809
I'm surprised I can't do these.

1135
02:17:10,809 --> 02:17:11,930
That's not a real table.

1136
02:17:11,930 --> 02:17:23,129
Look at that.

1137
02:17:23,129 --> 02:17:23,610
Oh shit.

1138
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:24,489
Flip it upside down.

1139
02:17:25,850 --> 02:17:27,209
This is the problem right here.

1140
02:17:27,209 --> 02:17:28,010
Just figuring it out.

1141
02:17:28,729 --> 02:17:43,059
Okay.

1142
02:17:44,229 --> 02:17:45,190
Now what does that do for me?

1143
02:17:53,590 --> 02:17:53,829
What?

1144
02:17:53,829 --> 02:17:54,149
I don't know.

1145
02:17:54,149 --> 02:17:55,110
It just knocks something off.

1146
02:18:01,530 --> 02:18:03,979
I think that's good.

1147
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:07,879
Can't remove this yet.

1148
02:18:07,879 --> 02:18:08,520
Is this screwed in?

1149
02:18:13,989 --> 02:18:14,469
Nice.

1150
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:16,899
Now, can I get it off?

1151
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:23,239
Oh, dick.

1152
02:18:23,239 --> 02:18:23,959
Come on.

1153
02:18:23,959 --> 02:18:37,750
This thing can be...

1154
02:18:39,909 --> 02:18:41,270
That's scaring the fuck out of me.

1155
02:18:41,270 --> 02:18:41,829
Stop doing that.

1156
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:44,489
What is happening?

1157
02:18:47,379 --> 02:18:49,059
It doesn't like when I pick this up.

1158
02:18:53,059 --> 02:18:53,379
Damn.

1159
02:18:53,379 --> 02:18:53,620
All right.

1160
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:54,579
This is the middle of there.

1161
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:57,879
This is where all the radiation comes from?

1162
02:19:00,569 --> 02:19:00,889
All right.

1163
02:19:00,889 --> 02:19:01,290
Let's go...

1164
02:19:04,579 --> 02:19:08,819
I still can't get into there.

1165
02:19:11,159 --> 02:19:12,840
It's not a real table.

1166
02:19:13,639 --> 02:19:23,700
What is holding this thing?

1167
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:25,459
Electromagnetic radiation.

1168
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:33,430
I still don't get what's holding all this shit in.

1169
02:19:34,469 --> 02:19:36,889
I guess they're latched in like that.

1170
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:41,989
Stay there.

1171
02:19:42,709 --> 02:19:45,850
Stop breaking my game.

1172
02:19:48,709 --> 02:19:50,309
I paid good money for this game.

1173
02:19:50,309 --> 02:19:50,549
All right.

1174
02:19:50,549 --> 02:20:01,399
I think we're getting close.

1175
02:20:03,579 --> 02:20:03,899
Six...

1176
02:20:03,899 --> 02:20:04,700
Oh my...

1177
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:05,020
Wow.

1178
02:20:05,819 --> 02:20:07,579
Did not fix 61 parts.

1179
02:20:07,579 --> 02:20:08,700
This is an intricate one.

1180
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:20,200
Gotta get in there.

1181
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:30,090
Yeah.

1182
02:20:30,090 --> 02:20:31,610
After this, we'll play Blade and Sorcery.

1183
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:35,850
Until I puke and then leave.

1184
02:20:36,729 --> 02:20:43,319
Get your camera ready because there might be a throw-up on camera.

1185
02:20:43,959 --> 02:20:48,540
I think that's good for that.

1186
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:57,049
It's still being held in.

1187
02:21:01,770 --> 02:21:02,489
By what?

1188
02:21:16,389 --> 02:21:17,270
How do I get rid of this?

1189
02:21:17,829 --> 02:21:21,209
Is there a screw?

1190
02:21:21,209 --> 02:21:22,329
There is a screw, isn't there?

1191
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:33,590
That it?

1192
02:21:34,229 --> 02:21:34,549
Yes.

1193
02:21:37,819 --> 02:21:38,700
Easy, easy.

1194
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:40,809
The panel can come off.

1195
02:21:41,690 --> 02:21:42,010
Right?

1196
02:21:43,459 --> 02:21:44,420
Yes, it can.

1197
02:21:46,309 --> 02:21:46,870
Excellent.

1198
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:50,889
Shake out the excess.

1199
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:55,959
These are connected to here.

1200
02:21:56,920 --> 02:21:57,559
Ultimately.

1201
02:21:58,360 --> 02:22:00,420
So the question is, how...

1202
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:01,780
Why can I not unscrew these?

1203
02:22:02,659 --> 02:22:21,079
Fucking hell.

1204
02:22:21,079 --> 02:22:33,719
Is there a screw?

1205
02:22:35,350 --> 02:22:36,069
Help me out here.

1206
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:40,139
I can't get this.

1207
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:42,809
I can't get that off.

1208
02:22:42,809 --> 02:22:46,940
Gonna watch wrestling a bit.

1209
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:48,379
What is going on?

1210
02:22:48,379 --> 02:22:52,409
What is this paragraph?

1211
02:22:55,420 --> 02:22:56,540
What was all over the...

1212
02:22:57,260 --> 02:22:58,840
Wait, what's going on?

1213
02:22:59,399 --> 02:23:00,280
Did I miss something?

1214
02:23:01,159 --> 02:23:03,270
Oh, that was part four?

1215
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:08,389
There's a nut on the screw.

1216
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:09,909
Give me the...

1217
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:14,139
Let me get a good look at this.

1218
02:23:41,739 --> 02:23:49,059
I don't know, man.

1219
02:23:49,059 --> 02:23:50,020
I'm kind of confused.

1220
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:57,500
Nerd neck.

1221
02:23:57,500 --> 02:23:59,180
I mean, I have to be like this.

1222
02:24:04,309 --> 02:24:06,149
You unlock tools by completing levels.

1223
02:24:09,079 --> 02:24:10,920
So the more level packs you complete,

1224
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:11,879
the more stuff you get.

1225
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:16,649
I'm kind of stuck here though.

1226
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:20,780
Because these can't...

1227
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:21,579
You can lift these up.

1228
02:24:24,790 --> 02:24:27,700
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

1229
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:33,290
Wait a minute.

1230
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:34,010
Give me the pliers.

1231
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:41,190
Come on.

1232
02:24:44,819 --> 02:24:45,059
Fuck.

1233
02:24:47,879 --> 02:24:48,360
No.

1234
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:53,370
What the hell is this?

1235
02:24:53,370 --> 02:25:03,899
Can I take this off?

1236
02:25:05,299 --> 02:25:06,020
Oh, shit.

1237
02:25:07,219 --> 02:25:11,100
I think I can pull back panel off.

1238
02:25:15,239 --> 02:25:15,559
Come on.

1239
02:25:15,559 --> 02:25:16,760
That was a eureka moment.

1240
02:25:16,760 --> 02:25:17,000
Why?

1241
02:25:17,799 --> 02:25:21,540
Oh, you're kidding me.

1242
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:21,780
What?

1243
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:27,260
Shit.

1244
02:25:28,139 --> 02:25:32,709
Is that a screw?

1245
02:25:35,879 --> 02:25:42,180
I don't know.

1246
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:43,139
I can't tell if it's a screw.

1247
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:53,100
No.

1248
02:26:01,430 --> 02:26:14,340
Ah, babe, I'm stumped.

1249
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:15,780
Because I can't get in here

1250
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:16,739
and undo these.

1251
02:26:17,299 --> 02:26:26,100
See what I mean?

1252
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:32,299
Ah, there we go.

1253
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:33,819
I did it.

1254
02:26:33,819 --> 02:26:40,840
I figured it out.

1255
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:41,319
Yes.

1256
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:43,909
Lovely.

1257
02:26:43,909 --> 02:26:45,030
Yes, yes, yes.

1258
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:48,329
Okay, let's get this out of here now.

1259
02:26:49,209 --> 02:26:52,469
Take it all apart.

1260
02:26:52,469 --> 02:26:54,069
Fantastic.

1261
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:56,440
Flop.

1262
02:26:58,100 --> 02:27:00,500
And this is still connected somehow to something.

1263
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:02,979
What is this connected to?

1264
02:27:09,219 --> 02:27:10,340
Nothing's even plugged in here.

1265
02:27:10,899 --> 02:27:12,729
These are all just straight wires.

1266
02:27:18,059 --> 02:27:19,020
I can't get under there.

1267
02:27:19,659 --> 02:27:26,440
Nothing's even attached.

1268
02:27:27,399 --> 02:27:28,200
It's just floating.

1269
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:32,409
Do I have to grab it with the pliers?

1270
02:27:38,569 --> 02:27:40,309
I'm going to throw it out the window.

1271
02:27:40,309 --> 02:27:41,110
Oh, it's been too long.

1272
02:27:41,110 --> 02:27:41,590
Don't do that.

1273
02:27:42,309 --> 02:27:54,760
All right, this doesn't make any sense

1274
02:27:54,760 --> 02:27:55,879
in the laws of physics.

1275
02:27:56,600 --> 02:28:13,190
Is that a tiny little screw?

1276
02:28:15,049 --> 02:28:15,290
No.

1277
02:28:23,639 --> 02:28:25,319
Every connector needs to be disconnected.

1278
02:28:25,879 --> 02:28:26,280
They're not?

1279
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:43,860
I mean, what is disconnected on this one?

1280
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:44,420
I can't even tell.

1281
02:28:52,790 --> 02:28:57,399
Ah, no.

1282
02:29:06,889 --> 02:29:07,290
Oh my god.

1283
02:29:07,290 --> 02:29:08,489
There's another one of these fucking things.

1284
02:29:09,290 --> 02:29:15,879
Look at this hidden ass screw.

1285
02:29:15,879 --> 02:29:18,329
Are you serious?

1286
02:29:18,329 --> 02:29:19,930
It was like stuffed in here.

1287
02:29:19,930 --> 02:29:25,940
Are there any more like hidden screws?

1288
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:27,139
This still can't come off.

1289
02:29:28,840 --> 02:29:30,760
What?

1290
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:31,319
Why?

1291
02:29:31,319 --> 02:29:32,840
I'm getting inside of here.

1292
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:35,239
There it is.

1293
02:29:35,239 --> 02:29:37,290
Right here.

1294
02:29:37,290 --> 02:29:38,010
All right, come on.

1295
02:29:38,729 --> 02:29:40,090
Oh, thank god.

1296
02:29:41,909 --> 02:29:42,389
Jesus.

1297
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:44,870
That took an eternity.

1298
02:29:45,829 --> 02:29:46,790
I'm going to get out of my face.

1299
02:29:47,510 --> 02:29:50,840
Now, how do I?

1300
02:29:50,840 --> 02:30:05,559
Ah, 38 pieces.

1301
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:09,340
I'm about to shoot it with the gun.

1302
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:20,139
I need to get in here.

1303
02:30:20,139 --> 02:30:27,110
The bottom right panel needs to be pulled out.

1304
02:30:27,110 --> 02:30:30,520
I mean, is there some magic hidden screw?

1305
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:31,799
That I didn't get?

1306
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:35,319
You know what I'm saying?

1307
02:30:35,879 --> 02:30:41,209
There's going to be some one fucking screw

1308
02:30:42,010 --> 02:30:43,219
that I didn't get.

1309
02:30:43,860 --> 02:30:49,100
Is that it?

1310
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:51,430
I can't even tell.

1311
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:57,770
Screw on the top?

1312
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:20,979
That's not a...

1313
02:31:20,979 --> 02:31:22,739
These, they look like phantom screws.

1314
02:31:23,459 --> 02:31:24,420
These aren't even real.

1315
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:30,250
You see, that's already been unscrewed.

1316
02:31:30,250 --> 02:31:31,049
I think.

1317
02:31:31,049 --> 02:31:31,610
I don't know.

1318
02:31:32,489 --> 02:31:39,510
Look at the side opposite the wires.

1319
02:31:40,229 --> 02:31:41,430
Damn, Jerma.

1320
02:31:41,430 --> 02:32:25,350
It's like you've never disassembled a microwave before.

1321
02:32:26,549 --> 02:32:27,350
Oh, that hurt.

1322
02:32:28,069 --> 02:32:29,270
It's like you've never...

1323
02:32:29,270 --> 02:32:31,180
Oh, that was good.

1324
02:32:31,180 --> 02:32:32,549
That was a good one.

1325
02:32:36,250 --> 02:32:37,049
What the fuck, man?

1326
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:38,969
Oh, this is not it?

1327
02:32:38,969 --> 02:32:40,739
I thought that was a screw right here.

1328
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:46,260
Oh my god, you're killing me.

1329
02:32:46,979 --> 02:32:48,100
Where is this?

1330
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:52,420
I keep thinking it's here, but it's not, right?

1331
02:32:59,180 --> 02:32:59,739
Oh my god.

1332
02:32:59,739 --> 02:33:00,379
Oh my god.

1333
02:33:00,379 --> 02:33:01,979
I keep thinking it's here, but it's not, right?

1334
02:33:07,399 --> 02:33:09,239
I can't like get into here

1335
02:33:09,239 --> 02:33:11,479
to like get out of this thing out of here.

1336
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:33,860
There's nothing even in there.

1337
02:33:35,129 --> 02:33:36,569
There's nothing even in there.

1338
02:33:43,260 --> 02:34:03,610
Screw in the center?

1339
02:34:04,569 --> 02:34:35,719
I need a better angle.

1340
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:41,139
Mom walks in.

1341
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:44,629
Jeffrey, what the fuck are you doing?

1342
02:34:45,559 --> 02:34:46,440
I'm sorry, mom.

1343
02:34:55,290 --> 02:34:59,780
I thought we were going to go to the hospital.

1344
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:05,940
Jeffrey fucking scrapped up his face and got a black eye.

1345
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:08,899
I'm trying to take apart the microwave.

1346
02:35:15,159 --> 02:35:15,959
Give it to me.

1347
02:35:20,709 --> 02:35:30,459
Press the life alert.

1348
02:35:40,309 --> 02:36:28,120
No, that's...

1349
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:28,760
Are you sure?

1350
02:36:31,559 --> 02:36:41,959
Where'd it go?

1351
02:36:41,959 --> 02:36:45,959
Where did it go?

1352
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:47,079
Where'd it go?

1353
02:36:47,799 --> 02:36:48,760
Right there.

1354
02:36:48,760 --> 02:37:03,100
That's not it.

1355
02:37:03,100 --> 02:37:03,739
I don't know.

1356
02:37:04,729 --> 02:37:05,610
I can't do it.

1357
02:37:05,610 --> 02:37:07,129
I don't know where the last little...

1358
02:37:07,129 --> 02:37:09,959
I gotta pull this apart.

1359
02:37:09,959 --> 02:37:10,760
Wait a minute.

1360
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:27,139
Damn it.

1361
02:37:27,139 --> 02:37:27,700
I'm stinking.

1362
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:43,459
Micro wheel.

1363
02:38:44,489 --> 02:38:44,729
No.

1364
02:38:45,370 --> 02:38:53,930
Make sure the connector on the wires is disconnected.

1365
02:39:09,659 --> 02:39:11,659
Is it in the north corner?

1366
02:39:11,659 --> 02:39:19,719
Please for the love of god try the bottom connectors on the motor.

1367
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:21,559
That's what I'm trying to do.

1368
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:23,319
I can't get them.

1369
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:26,700
I tried like five times.

1370
02:39:27,500 --> 02:39:37,379
See like they can only go back this far and I can't do anything with it.

1371
02:39:38,020 --> 02:39:42,659
You stupid fucking game.

1372
02:39:42,659 --> 02:39:43,940
Are you serious right now?

1373
02:39:49,799 --> 02:39:51,079
I did it.

1374
02:39:51,079 --> 02:39:59,479
You just gotta get your whole head in here.

1375
02:39:59,479 --> 02:40:00,200
I didn't even do it.

1376
02:40:02,680 --> 02:40:03,559
That didn't do anything.

1377
02:40:05,639 --> 02:40:07,399
No, it didn't do anything.

1378
02:40:07,399 --> 02:40:25,370
No, what was that screw for?

1379
02:40:25,370 --> 02:40:46,299
What was it for?

1380
02:40:46,299 --> 02:40:47,500
Middle inner microwave.

1381
02:40:48,059 --> 02:41:22,940
I'm going in.

1382
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:23,739
Other side.

1383
02:41:26,459 --> 02:41:34,860
I can't even get the damn panel off.

1384
02:41:35,579 --> 02:41:38,780
I think I give up.

1385
02:41:43,299 --> 02:41:46,020
I can't like reliably get my fucking hands in here.

1386
02:42:43,690 --> 02:43:19,059
No, no, that was it.

1387
02:43:19,059 --> 02:43:19,860
That was the end.

1388
02:43:20,979 --> 02:43:21,620
That was it.

1389
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:23,020
What happened?

1390
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:23,579
What's wrong?

1391
02:43:29,049 --> 02:43:29,530
What happened?

1392
02:43:29,530 --> 02:43:30,969
What's wrong here?

1393
02:43:30,969 --> 02:43:38,819
Just unscrew the side panel.

1394
02:43:38,819 --> 02:43:40,420
What are you talking about?

1395
02:43:40,420 --> 02:43:42,180
I've unscrewed every screw.

1396
02:43:51,299 --> 02:43:54,790
There's nothing holding this shit.

1397
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:56,469
There's nothing here anymore.

1398
02:43:56,469 --> 02:44:05,719
What the?

1399
02:44:05,719 --> 02:44:06,040
What?

1400
02:44:07,620 --> 02:44:08,180
What?

1401
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:09,940
This is just floating in midair.

1402
02:44:26,780 --> 02:44:27,899
Wiggle the connectors.

1403
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:40,329
Pull the connectors down.

1404
02:45:41,610 --> 02:45:45,370
Aren't they all down already?

1405
02:45:45,370 --> 02:45:54,010
The bottom panel is red.

1406
02:45:59,690 --> 02:46:00,409
Bottom panel.

1407
02:46:00,409 --> 02:46:01,129
Bottom panel.

1408
02:46:01,770 --> 02:46:04,729
Guys, you're talking about right here, right?

1409
02:46:04,729 --> 02:46:05,770
This is what you're talking about.

1410
02:46:05,770 --> 02:46:06,729
Talking about this panel.

1411
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:12,090
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what you're talking about.

1412
02:46:12,090 --> 02:46:12,809
Where's the screw?

1413
02:46:14,329 --> 02:46:14,889
Where is it?

1414
02:46:16,250 --> 02:46:17,049
That's not a screw.

1415
02:46:17,850 --> 02:46:18,889
I can't remove this.

1416
02:46:19,770 --> 02:46:22,500
This thing's all fucked up.

1417
02:46:23,219 --> 02:46:25,590
There is no way to remove this.

1418
02:46:44,620 --> 02:46:45,579
Crowbar.

1419
02:46:45,579 --> 02:46:47,819
Don't even tell me it was the crowbar.

1420
02:46:48,459 --> 02:46:59,559
Slide it?

1421
02:46:59,559 --> 02:47:00,200
It's red.

1422
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:01,319
I can't slide it.

1423
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:03,319
There is no sliding.

1424
02:47:03,319 --> 02:47:03,879
It's red.

1425
02:47:05,079 --> 02:47:07,479
Something is keeping this here.

1426
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:11,190
But fuck if I know what the hell it is.

1427
02:47:24,729 --> 02:47:37,450
That's not a screw.

1428
02:47:37,450 --> 02:47:40,180
It's almost like this screw was supposed to be here.

1429
02:47:40,180 --> 02:47:42,100
But it's like a JPG.

1430
02:47:50,540 --> 02:47:52,620
It might be broken like the rice cooker was.

1431
02:47:53,930 --> 02:47:54,809
Hex key?

1432
02:47:54,809 --> 02:47:56,170
No, there's no indicator.

1433
02:47:57,129 --> 02:47:58,409
There's not even an indicator.

1434
02:47:59,879 --> 02:48:01,239
There would be an indicator, watch.

1435
02:48:02,790 --> 02:48:03,750
There's no indicator.

1436
02:48:06,090 --> 02:48:07,290
This thing just doesn't exist.

1437
02:48:13,299 --> 02:48:15,780
Have I really been just scouring this whole thing

1438
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:17,860
and it just glitched out and I can't even do it?

1439
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:39,829
Smart click?

1440
02:48:39,829 --> 02:48:41,670
No, there's nothing here to unscrew.

1441
02:48:42,709 --> 02:48:44,389
There really isn't anything to unscrew.

1442
02:48:58,280 --> 02:48:59,639
Looks like that but there's a hole.

1443
02:49:01,750 --> 02:49:08,969
Where's the screw?

1444
02:49:09,610 --> 02:49:10,250
Where's the screw?

1445
02:49:11,270 --> 02:49:11,909
Didn't exist.

1446
02:49:12,629 --> 02:49:26,760
There was no screw.

1447
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:36,629
That was so long.

1448
02:49:36,629 --> 02:49:49,770
There was no screw.

1449
02:49:49,770 --> 02:49:53,450
I got baited to 45 that it's a microwave prep.

1450
02:49:54,090 --> 02:49:56,340
Let's do the computer.

1451
02:49:56,340 --> 02:50:27,370
Okay, what we got in here?

1452
02:50:29,989 --> 02:50:32,360
DVDs?

1453
02:50:32,360 --> 02:50:33,159
Okay, we got...

1454
02:50:33,879 --> 02:50:34,840
How is there this many parts?

1455
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:36,280
There's not a hundred parts in a computer.

1456
02:50:39,930 --> 02:50:40,569
There's the brain.

1457
02:50:40,569 --> 02:50:41,530
We'll see.

1458
02:50:41,530 --> 02:50:56,780
Here's the...

1459
02:50:56,780 --> 02:50:58,219
Why is the power supply up here?

1460
02:50:58,940 --> 02:51:00,700
Shouldn't the power supply be down here?

1461
02:51:00,700 --> 02:51:02,860
This person installed this upside down.

1462
02:51:06,739 --> 02:51:07,940
It's supposed to look like this.

1463
02:51:11,559 --> 02:51:18,569
But, right?

1464
02:51:18,569 --> 02:51:21,620
Doesn't the power supply just sit on the bottom and the...

1465
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:25,500
People do a hanging power supply like that?

1466
02:51:29,079 --> 02:51:31,159
They're not even fucking computer experts.

1467
02:51:31,159 --> 02:51:39,559
Okay, there's the little...

1468
02:51:39,559 --> 02:51:41,610
This will all come out sedazy.

1469
02:51:41,610 --> 02:51:42,329
I don't know what that was.

1470
02:51:43,129 --> 02:51:45,219
The heat sink.

1471
02:51:45,940 --> 02:51:47,190
CPU.

1472
02:51:47,190 --> 02:51:49,110
All right, let's get our workstation clean.

1473
02:51:50,229 --> 02:52:08,170
What is that?

1474
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:08,809
16 gig?

1475
02:52:09,770 --> 02:52:13,420
What, you only got 16 gig in here?

1476
02:52:14,889 --> 02:52:25,100
SSD?

1477
02:52:25,739 --> 02:52:26,780
Nice.

1478
02:52:26,780 --> 02:52:33,829
All right, let's get out of here.

1479
02:52:33,829 --> 02:52:36,870
Is this tool-less?

1480
02:52:36,870 --> 02:52:38,950
Nah, not tool-less, unfortunately.

1481
02:52:39,510 --> 02:52:56,219
It doesn't even have tool-less.

1482
02:52:56,219 --> 02:53:06,420
It makes a cool noise.

1483
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:19,270
All right, so that graphics card is wedged the fuck in here.

1484
02:53:19,270 --> 02:53:21,989
I don't know who installed this, but they did a terrible job.

1485
02:53:25,159 --> 02:53:26,040
You know, where's the tab?

1486
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:33,899
I mean, just awful.

1487
02:53:33,899 --> 02:53:35,100
Absolutely awful job.

1488
02:53:35,739 --> 02:53:54,739
If you take this part too, that'd be cool if you take that apart.

1489
02:53:56,440 --> 02:53:57,959
There's the small battery.

1490
02:54:02,549 --> 02:54:21,530
All right.

1491
02:54:22,790 --> 02:54:23,670
Oh, god damn it.

1492
02:54:28,219 --> 02:54:29,579
PC repair shop.

1493
02:54:31,159 --> 02:54:34,120
The guy that covers his hands in oil before he touches it.

1494
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:38,969
I've got some screws back here we're going to take care of.

1495
02:55:21,379 --> 02:55:28,409
We'll deal with you later.

1496
02:55:28,409 --> 02:55:30,170
Oh my god, now look at this little thing.

1497
02:55:30,170 --> 02:55:31,610
It's causing this much of a problem.

1498
02:55:41,899 --> 02:55:42,940
Artery?

1499
02:55:42,940 --> 02:56:17,510
All right, let's pull this thing out.

1500
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:26,389
We're going to take this whole thing apart too.

1501
02:56:27,930 --> 02:56:28,889
Oh, joy.

1502
02:56:29,370 --> 02:56:39,690
Flyers probably.

1503
02:56:39,690 --> 02:56:41,209
We'll deal with you later.

1504
02:56:41,209 --> 02:56:41,850
You stay there.

1505
02:56:42,860 --> 02:56:44,700
Anything else on the main frame of the computer?

1506
02:56:45,260 --> 02:56:46,200
I don't think so.

1507
02:56:46,840 --> 02:56:49,590
Well, there is.

1508
02:56:49,590 --> 02:56:53,100
Screwed up.

1509
02:56:53,100 --> 02:57:04,870
You know, take, I'm going to do the whole skeleton too.

1510
02:57:07,670 --> 02:57:15,739
Drop on the wall.

1511
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:27,239
Backplate?

1512
02:57:28,569 --> 02:57:29,610
Get this backplate.

1513
02:57:29,610 --> 02:57:30,170
Is that it?

1514
02:57:31,590 --> 02:57:32,389
That's got to be it.

1515
02:57:33,270 --> 02:57:34,469
No, I got this shit too.

1516
02:57:38,549 --> 02:57:39,030
Grills?

1517
02:57:39,899 --> 02:57:42,540
No, I think that's it.

1518
02:57:47,930 --> 02:57:48,649
Now the rubber things.

1519
02:57:48,649 --> 02:57:49,209
No, come on.

1520
02:57:49,930 --> 02:57:50,729
We'll go up here.

1521
02:57:51,930 --> 02:57:52,569
Oh, okay.

1522
02:57:54,569 --> 02:57:55,690
I thought that comes off.

1523
02:57:56,329 --> 02:57:58,459
I think that's it.

1524
02:57:59,659 --> 02:58:00,860
We'll check back on it later.

1525
02:58:02,500 --> 02:58:04,340
So we've got some parts left to do.

1526
02:58:05,299 --> 02:58:12,860
There's a lot of shit in there.

1527
02:58:13,659 --> 02:58:17,780
Can't just pull it out?

1528
02:58:19,510 --> 02:58:20,149
Oh, okay.

1529
02:58:20,149 --> 02:58:21,110
I'll do it again.

1530
02:58:23,659 --> 02:58:24,059
Why not?

1531
02:58:30,520 --> 02:58:31,000
Bullshit.

1532
02:58:31,799 --> 02:58:44,010
Turn, tilt.

1533
02:58:45,590 --> 02:58:45,909
Come on.

1534
02:58:51,049 --> 02:58:53,819
This is just fun to do.

1535
02:58:53,819 --> 02:58:54,379
It really is.

1536
02:58:55,100 --> 02:58:59,030
Oh, my back.

1537
02:58:59,590 --> 02:59:02,809
Dude, I swear to God, something's fucking wrong with me.

1538
02:59:03,610 --> 02:59:09,979
My spine is so fucked up.

1539
02:59:18,139 --> 02:59:18,780
None of these come out?

1540
02:59:19,340 --> 02:59:21,930
I'm going to hold mono just in case.

1541
02:59:21,930 --> 02:59:23,610
I feel like something's going to come out of there.

1542
02:59:23,610 --> 02:59:28,219
No?

1543
02:59:28,219 --> 02:59:28,860
Okay.

1544
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:29,899
The video card.

1545
02:59:29,899 --> 02:59:32,860
Let's take a look.

1546
02:59:32,860 --> 02:59:39,399
Uh-huh.

1547
02:59:40,120 --> 02:59:50,680
Is that it?

1548
02:59:51,239 --> 02:59:53,209
Can I pull this apart now?

1549
02:59:53,209 --> 02:59:53,610
Yep.

1550
02:59:53,610 --> 02:59:53,930
Whoa.

1551
02:59:55,049 --> 03:00:01,959
There you go.

1552
03:00:01,959 --> 03:00:02,920
That's it looking like inside.

1553
03:00:04,739 --> 03:00:05,700
Take a look at the teeth.

1554
03:00:06,340 --> 03:00:09,000
And I think that's it.

1555
03:00:10,549 --> 03:00:11,750
I can't pull this out, can I?

1556
03:00:12,389 --> 03:00:13,590
All right.

1557
03:00:13,590 --> 03:00:14,149
Yes, I can.

1558
03:00:14,870 --> 03:00:17,049
All right.

1559
03:00:17,049 --> 03:00:17,610
See you later.

1560
03:00:19,219 --> 03:00:22,340
That leaves us with a CPU.

1561
03:00:23,379 --> 03:00:24,229
What about that?

1562
03:00:24,229 --> 03:00:25,350
I'm going to have to take this apart too.

1563
03:00:26,889 --> 03:00:27,129
No?

1564
03:00:29,610 --> 03:00:30,170
No?

1565
03:00:30,170 --> 03:00:30,729
I guess not.

1566
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:33,079
Hard drive?

1567
03:00:33,959 --> 03:00:35,860
I'm going to do all this shit.

1568
03:00:35,860 --> 03:00:36,500
Wow.

1569
03:00:36,500 --> 03:00:37,139
This is pretty cool.

1570
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:41,989
This is a solid stare, right?

1571
03:00:54,579 --> 03:00:55,059
Noises.

1572
03:00:55,620 --> 03:00:56,020
Three.

1573
03:00:56,819 --> 03:01:02,219
Oops.

1574
03:01:02,219 --> 03:01:02,459
Cool.

1575
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:04,700
Anything else to pull off of you?

1576
03:01:05,579 --> 03:01:06,870
I don't think so.

1577
03:01:08,709 --> 03:01:10,309
I don't think you have anything either.

1578
03:01:13,420 --> 03:01:15,340
That leaves us with the final piece.

1579
03:01:16,299 --> 03:01:18,219
The motherboard.

1580
03:01:18,219 --> 03:01:40,629
Scratch it up real nice.

1581
03:01:41,190 --> 03:01:50,200
All right.

1582
03:01:50,200 --> 03:01:51,239
Is that it?

1583
03:01:51,239 --> 03:01:55,059
Is there something else?

1584
03:01:55,059 --> 03:01:55,379
Oh, dude.

1585
03:01:55,379 --> 03:01:55,780
What is this?

1586
03:01:55,780 --> 03:01:56,180
What is this?

1587
03:01:56,180 --> 03:01:56,979
EVGA?

1588
03:01:56,979 --> 03:02:02,149
Oh, wait.

1589
03:02:02,149 --> 03:02:02,709
GIGABYTE?

1590
03:02:03,430 --> 03:02:04,309
What's left?

1591
03:02:04,309 --> 03:02:22,549
Something over here.

1592
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:41,319
What about this?

1593
03:02:41,959 --> 03:02:42,840
Another piece here?

1594
03:02:43,399 --> 03:02:45,239
Does it pop out?

1595
03:02:45,239 --> 03:02:45,879
Oh.

1596
03:02:45,879 --> 03:02:49,319
Okay.

1597
03:02:49,879 --> 03:02:59,559
Oh, the graphics card.

1598
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:03,180
What would it be?

1599
03:03:03,979 --> 03:03:04,299
Oh.

1600
03:03:06,620 --> 03:03:18,299
There's a bunch of random shit.

1601
03:03:22,409 --> 03:03:24,950
There is something else on here.

1602
03:03:25,590 --> 03:03:27,129
Or on here.

1603
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:34,899
This piece?

1604
03:03:38,329 --> 03:03:40,889
It would look like this little slap right here.

1605
03:03:51,420 --> 03:03:52,520
Really?

1606
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:53,239
This little thing?

1607
03:03:57,930 --> 03:03:59,370
Six more pieces.

1608
03:03:59,370 --> 03:04:14,889
A table?

1609
03:04:17,690 --> 03:04:18,250
Apparently.

1610
03:04:18,889 --> 03:04:19,850
God, fuck you.

1611
03:04:23,659 --> 03:04:25,500
Two, three, four.

1612
03:04:25,500 --> 03:04:26,459
Well, that's almost all of it.

1613
03:04:26,459 --> 03:04:26,940
Just two more.

1614
03:04:27,739 --> 03:04:41,129
The fan?

1615
03:04:44,389 --> 03:04:44,870
Dude.

1616
03:04:44,870 --> 03:04:46,629
Will you pick the fucking thing up?

1617
03:04:47,989 --> 03:04:49,190
You're making me crazy.

1618
03:04:50,469 --> 03:04:52,389
That's it.

1619
03:04:56,299 --> 03:05:27,270
Computer.

1620
03:05:27,350 --> 03:05:31,260
You forgot the seasoning.

1621
03:05:31,260 --> 03:05:34,819
All right, let's do Blade and Sorcery.

1622
03:05:34,819 --> 03:05:38,889
Let's try the update.

1623
03:05:38,889 --> 03:05:42,010
This game is so much fucking fun, but we'll try something else.

1624
03:05:53,340 --> 03:05:55,579
We'll do the Blade and Sorcery update.

1625
03:05:57,049 --> 03:05:58,489
That was way easier than the microwave.

1626
03:05:58,489 --> 03:05:59,290
There was no other screw.

1627
03:06:00,010 --> 03:06:02,120
All right, let me go pee.

1628
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:03,399
Let me grab some more water.

1629
03:06:03,399 --> 03:06:04,600
And we'll do Blade and Sorcery.

1630
03:06:04,600 --> 03:06:05,399
Be right back.
