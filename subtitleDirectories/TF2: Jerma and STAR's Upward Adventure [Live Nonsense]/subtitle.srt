00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:17,839
Hi, you gotta go with that. I was I was thinking you were gonna say something to it just be like

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,660
My name is drama and this is my youtube channel and I'm playing with star. He's a fun friend

4
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:41,530
Hey, are you are you the room? Hey, you're not supposed to blow yourself up until the round starts. Oh

5
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,670
I

6
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:52,310
Was getting healed. That's why I'll do it right this time. I'm putting all eight of these friggin things right here

7
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,020
What the hell is that?

8
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:07,560
What the fuck is that? Hold on. Wait a second fun. You've been spawn quick. Here we go. Sticky jump, baby

00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:15,060
What? Oh god tip. I was so confused. Oh

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,109
Okay, I was looking at the kill feed and I saw German 985

11
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:25,510
Somebody and I with a rocket I was like I didn't kill anybody with what the hell's going on

12
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,549
I was standing still and died. You have to understand something very important is you're not the real German

13
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:37,239
I really am I'm not you are the real German right now. That was the worst sticky jump

14
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:51,200
I think I've anyone could have ever done. I gotta get behind somebody now or get on the car. That works too. Bye

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:00,480
No, pyro. Yeah, come on spawn spawn spawn spawn spawn spawn health pack. Yeah

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,110
No, I'm not on the goddamn pyro

18
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,069
First wait take one second. I want you to look at how many spies we have on our team. Hold on

19
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:29,569
I killed y'all you shot that rocket and he reflected it into me and now you're dead

20
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:32,750
Look how many spies are on our team?

21
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,030
I was watching all five of them fighting a spy from the other team. It was brilliant

22
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,780
Just I gotta say it

23
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,520
Why the blue team's been losing five spies

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,810
There you go

25
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,580
I'm happy that in the fact that I killed you. I was awesome. That was pretty friggin hilarious

26
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:09,039
I think I might have to change classes. I'm not doing anything as a demo man right now. Let's go

27
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,699
What do you have? What do you have for a load-up right now? I dead ringer knife

28
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,879
Pretty much stock except dead ringer. All right

29
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,729
So are we gonna like try to fool the other team or something that guy's gonna I don't think they're gonna fall for it

30
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:33,360
I think they pretty much just no. Oh my god. There's I'm dead down down. I knew it. I knew this guy

00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,719
No, no, I can't I can't in good conscience. I can't I can't do this anymore

32
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:53,129
They know why did why did like two people jump after me a teammate and an enemy just both jumped off the cliff after me

33
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,039
Off the cliff. Oh, yeah, they know I'm a spy. They're coming probably gonna win

34
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:06,360
I mean, it's taking a while, but we're getting there. I have confidence gotta have confidence. You have to have confidence

35
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,430
I mean, you know, it's like about fanboy moment

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,669
What's going on? Don't over why did I get uber'd?

37
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:17,750
Exactly. There's no one there. Um, oh he's behind

You and the cat make it happen

42
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:57,480
There's another pyro back here where they where these guys come in from every time I kill one

43
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,399
There's immediately one to replace it. It doesn't matter how many I've killed

44
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:09,370
It's a little ridiculous, please. Heal me, please. Please. Heal me. Oh

Am I just going crazy and like hitting myself on the screen pyros three pyros? I counted three

48
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:42,120
Should just go pyro and pyro the pyros could also I could go heavy too. That's a pretty big counter to pyro

49
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,100
Hold the button down on their face

50
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:52,990
Walking backwards is pretty good, too. Yeah. Well, we're on it. We're on it. Could we win this kid? No

51
00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:01,600

53
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,730
I'm going heavy weapons. No play pyro. What the hell happened here next time you get a chance to come out of spawn

54
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,009
Just take a look at what take a look at that like scene. That's right out in front of the spawn

What what was that?

60
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,399
They were like inside of each other. Is this guy like multi boxing like five pyros?

61
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:15,379
It's just one guy playing the game really well. Oh, we got this. We got it. Oh, baby. Boom

German 95 number one. Yeah, see I top score. You're so good pyro heavy pyro

63
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:34,339
I'm amazed. All right, when you've respawned we're gonna try to move as the same person. Okay, we'll be the same guy

64
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,149
We need to you know, when you have like three legged races, that's us

65
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:50,420
Okay, you ready? This is going to be so difficult, right? I can't even see you. I guess you're okay

66
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,699
I'm like I'm trying to like stay into you. That's a spy trotty trotty trotty

67
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:03,399
I don't know where he went trying to shoot at the same time as you. Yeah, we got him

68
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:16,730
Okay, back up back up getting the small health kit. Oh spy. Yeah, you punk get out of here. Where'd you go?

70
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:34,120
I want four legs. We'd just like to draw attention this match to how many snipers we have. Oh, we I keep seeing snipers

71
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,860
I'm like, oh, hey, what is this guy doing? What the hell was that?

72
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:45,799
That guy was standing behind me as a pyro. I almost freaked me out

73
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,000
I felt like I was on the other team

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,990
You ever have that happen where like somebody's just like not doing anything that is a walking around around you and you think you're on

75
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,580
The other team. Yeah, I feel like we're playing call of duty right now

76
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,960
I feel like the spawns are all over the place. I feel like everyone just appears behind me

77
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:10,179
A lot of spies just doing their thing like this scout. The scouts just like behind everybody. This guy's dead

78
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:17,879
The spy got me again. I just every time. Oh, come on. That wasn't a headshot both. Yeah

79
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,639
That would have been such an amazing shot. Too bad. I'm not good enough

80
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,559
I wish you could have saw that that was great. Oh

81
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,659
That's a highlight and that's a spy and that's a goddamn pyro and that's another

82
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:46,429
Where are these people coming from? Really? I see what you mean

83
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,659
He's dead. No, he's right. Oh, yeah, you want to get body blocked. Is that what you want to have happen?

84
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,110
You want to get clubbed? Oh, that's you can jump wherever you want. Oh

85
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:06,649
What do you know about that slam dunk slam dunk? You want some peanut butter with that jam? Oh

86
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,730
Mike man, that's how I walk off the bram. Oh, there's a pyro behind me. Okay

87
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,860
No more sniper. It's serious business time. Yeah, I think I've stayed alive

88
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,029
I don't think I've stayed alive for more than 15 seconds. That's okay

89
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:33,289
Half this video is going to be the respawn time in the top corner. Just just slice that just cut it

90
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:44,200
Just cut it up crop. It didn't happen. Oh, they've got a heavy pocketed. I just want to win

91
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:51,529
No backstab by this same guy every time. Leave me alone, dude. There are other people here

92
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,460
Give me the health just
