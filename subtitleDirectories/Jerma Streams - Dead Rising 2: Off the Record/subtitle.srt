1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:08,539
Oh hi guys. Do you want to see... I'm a little irritated.

2
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,980
You want to see something that I cannot believe.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,219
I'm trying to figure out how this is even possible.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,420
First of all, sorry I'm a little bit late. I had some controller input issues

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,019
because Dead Rising 2 does not actually have native

6
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:26,699
controller support built into the PC version. So I had to

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,820
get an emulator for that and wow what a pain in the ass. But

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,950
even worse than that. Somehow. Just skip the intro.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:43,850
Give me a scenario, any scenario, where at the at the menu screen having

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:50,170
art gallery, downloadable content, and import games for windows live is

11
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:57,909
more important than the options menu. You gotta go

12
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:05,430
into the fucking game, into the actual video game to change settings.

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,159
Why is this here? Imagine getting this shown.

14
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,090
You're a boss, you're the boss, okay? You're the boss of a video game company.

15
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,780
You make video games and this is what you're presented for the

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:29,980
the the menu for the game? I'd be like go back and redo this whole fucking thing.

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,819
This is like advertisements.

18
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:38,969
Give me the options menu so I can like check to see if my controller works.

19
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:45,340
Can we change the graphic settings? What?

20
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,579
Yeah import games for windows live. That's more important.

21
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:55,620
I'm surprised there's a goddamn quit button here. Anyways how you doing?

22
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:03,659
The game's 10 years old. The first one had it.

23
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,780
The first game had this. Every game has this. It's not just 10 years.

24
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,900
Every fucking video game. Every video game has an

25
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:21,770
options menu before you start the video game.

26
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,770
Downloadable content? That's got to be hidden in the options menu.

27
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:33,719
Put these in the options menu. Would you run out of time?

28
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,400
Anyways hi guys we're gonna play Dead Rising 2 off the record today.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,800
Why am I not playing the original game? Well we had a

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,530
a lot of deliberation in the chat room and hold on you can't even hear this.

31
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,379
We had a lot of deliberation in the chat room about which one

32
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,439
I should play because I thought they were different games but they're not.

33
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,289
There was a lot of fighting. You have no idea. I'm sitting here trying to set up

34
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,650
my controller, emulate my goddamn xbox one controller.

35
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,520
I look over here and there's a fight. Like a brawl in the chat about

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,960
which version of the game should I play and it was just like

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,270
people would throw and shit tables are flipped over.

38
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,189
But it came to my realization that they are in fact the same

39
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,689
video game told from different perspectives. The bosses and the

40
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,509
items, everything's the same. This one has some extra content is what

41
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:38,099
I've been told. By like 70% of the people in the chat.

42
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:52,680
This is not true. Literally not true. This one's not canon though.

43
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,490
This is a DLC. No it's not. No it's not because I

44
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,770
listen to me. I downloaded Dead Rising 2. This is a separate purchase on Steam.

45
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,819
It's a separate video game. I made that mistake.

46
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,699
This is not a DLC for Dead Rising 2. This is a full standalone video game.

47
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:26,230
Dead Rising 2 again. He bought the wrong one. No this is the

48
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,189
right one because I want to use the camera too and we're playing with Frank.

49
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:47,990
Still no options menu by the way. This is Dead Rising 2 too.

50
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,680
So what I could do, I was thinking about doing both anyways.

51
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:01,110
Going back and playing as Chuck. This is why like constant conflict in

52
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,870
this chat. I may as well open up a Barbie game after

53
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,779
talking about all this. Do a poll. I did three of them before

54
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,939
the stream started. Unanimously it was this game. We're going.

55
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:24,600
Don't care. Like it was 80 percent. It was like 75 percent.

56
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,769
I clawed my way out of Willamette. I fought hard

57
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:33,209
to uncover the truth of what happened at that mall.

58
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:41,800
This is really loud. Turn your speakers down for a few minutes

59
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,389
because I can't alt tab. Things were good.

60
00:05:48,389 --> 00:06:01,060
Real good. It was an options aisle.

61
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:08,579
Then I let things get to me. I let things

62
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,180
get out of control. Dead Rising 2. The original has options.

63
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,899
Are you fucking kidding me? How is it possible to have this?

64
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:24,899
I think deep down I knew I hadn't uncovered what was really going on.

65
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:56,740
Fighting never ends. This is a fight. Things got pretty dark. I'm like dad at

66
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,779
the dinner table while the whole family argues.

67
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,620
To get back at game. I got a huge family. I'm at the very end of the table just

68
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,300
slowly cutting my steak and I hear people yelling about their days and

69
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,420
screaming at each other about what's better and I'm just like god damn it.

70
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,420
How do I keep this fucking family together? I just take a bite.

71
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:50,459
Excuse me sir. What is it kid? I signed your waiver.

72
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,980
You got my next of kin. Are the vultures circling already?

73
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,259
Everybody settle down. Yeah sorry sir. It's just paperwork.

74
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,860
They want it from everyone. Oh I've lost control. Would you mind if I got your

75
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:12,040
autograph? This spoils too but this this is too.

76
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,319
Isn't it? It's isn't the same game. Sorry about that.

77
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,980
What's going on? Everybody sit up. It's been a while.

78
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,579
Eat your peas Jeffrey. You've always been a big hero. You never eat your peas.

79
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:27,509
I was really bummed when your show went off the air.

80
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:32,409
Wow thanks. So I guess this would be worth quite a bit if anything happened

81
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:40,100
to you out there tonight. Uh yeah I guess so. Good luck out there.

82
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:48,950
Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.

83
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:58,759
TK has a very special surprise for you. He is the original zombie killer himself.

84
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:04,840
No I'm not. I'm the DLC killer. The one, the only,

85
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,879
Frank Weiss.

86
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:20,019
So Fortune City. Now for a show. I know it's really loud but I

87
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,700
don't have access. Showing options. That's an awesome

88
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,299
scepter microphone. That scepter microphone is

89
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:32,259
unbelievable. Bigger than payoffs. Especially if you use those corner

90
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:37,460
grinders. I do like a good grinding.

91
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:44,179
But first TK has got a personal message just for you Frank Weiss.

92
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:48,419
You gotta be willing to risk it all if you're ever

93
00:09:48,419 --> 00:10:06,169
really gonna win. That's so loud. Okay. Hi guys.

94
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:13,610
Okay kill zombies win money. You got it. Stop. Stop. Oh.

95
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,460
Would have been really nice if this was available.

96
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:38,889
Fuck a DLC game. Can you guys hear me? God I'm back. Subtitles it's fine.

97
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:51,259
Uh nope. PC settings. That's all right. Controller. Yes.

98
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:59,000
Blur effects. No. High. High. Forex. Save those changes.

99
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,580
Keep these changes. Yes. It's at 60 hertz right now.

100
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:12,330
Oh give me a break. Why did it? Visual. PC settings. Uh oh.

101
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,289
If this crashes. If this crashes the game I'm gonna put a halt from my

102
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:33,059
monitor and I'm ending the stream. Okay we're good. All right you ready?

103
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:49,940
Let's go. Why am I not playing two? Because there was a huge fight at the

104
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,179
dinner table before the stream started. And like 70% of the people told me to

105
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,899
play this one. Clip that and and

106
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,940
clip that fucking thing I just said.

107
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:33,940
And if anybody asks. Oh shit. They were wrong. I don't know man.

108
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,740
I haven't played these games before. I thought I was under the impression that

109
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,179
this was they like redid two and made it with another character and added

110
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,220
features. This is two again but it's not the same. Everybody hates Chuck.

111
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,340
Nobody likes Chuck. I don't even know who that is. They just don't like that

112
00:12:48,340 --> 00:13:03,259
person. Jump on the corner. Oops I wasn't looking.

113
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:17,240
All right I'm gonna get as many people up here as I can. Go!

114
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,129
Grind him up. Oh the fire comes out. Right.

115
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:36,330
Almost at 15. Look I'll like speedrun the fucking first game okay?

116
00:13:36,330 --> 00:14:11,500
No jump off. Dammit. 25,000. Why is he not freaking going up?

117
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:32,889
3,000. 4,000. 5,000. 25,000. They have to be in the ring?

118
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,809
They gotta be in the ring. Gotta be in the ring. Gotta be in the ring. Somebody

119
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:47,190
get in the ring. No!

120
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:31,539
I'm so I said every cutscene is fucking pre-rendered and pre-loaded and you

121
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:36,090
can't do anything about it. Use volume mixer and windows. Well I

122
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,009
have to that I have to I have to alt tap and the game fucking breaks if you alt

123
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,610
tab. Video games suck okay? Can we just be

124
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:56,549
very clear? These things are being held together with

125
00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:02,250
like Elmer's glue especially on PC like 10 years ago.

126
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:46,090
Is that Chuck? I can't believe I just did that. I feel like such a sellout.

127
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,159
Hey do you know how I can get the hell out of here? Yeah take the elevator up a

128
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,840
floor and then straight down the hallway.

129
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,100
You can't miss it. All right now imagine my shock

130
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,490
when I put a poll in chat that has three or four hundred votes on it

131
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,170
and 70 percent of those people say this is the one you should play.

132
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,690
Now imagine my shock when I turn the stream on and in comes the flood of

133
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,420
people that say that it was completely wrong.

134
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:22,839
It was like 70 percent. What about the other three thousand votes?

135
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:47,180
Imagine my fucking shock. I did a poll three times.

136
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,779
It's over. Well I just this is just this is you want to talk about not canon

137
00:17:50,779 --> 00:18:12,230
stories? Here's a not canon story for you. Here's

138
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:30,950
some here's some non-canon for you. The fuck? How could this be different?

139
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:39,980
It's the same audience. What? You guys are doing this just just out of

140
00:18:39,980 --> 00:19:01,140
spite right now. Even still for god damn it. Is he fatter?

141
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,859
Frank wants to use the guide arrow to find a way to the exit. The guide arrow

142
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:15,690
will always point towards Frank's current objective.

143
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,130
No the mistake I made was playing a game that's more than 10 years old that has

144
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:39,420
a lot of fans. That's the biggest mistake of all.

145
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,619
60 percent. How many of those people did that just to be a dick?

146
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:48,039
I wonder. We're doing this. We're doing this because I'm already here and I

147
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,480
already set up the stupid emulator to use the controller.

148
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,980
I'm gonna go back you know just to spite everything.

149
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,569
I'm gonna play through two again as chuck when I'm done with this.

150
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:17,609
All right save the game visit a bathroom. You can save as often as

151
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:21,369
as you'd like and it's a good idea to do so. Find the closest bathroom by looking

152
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:35,289
for the save icon on the map. Okay I just walked away from it. Okay me

153
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,930
and Frank have the same body. That's I mean at least ass wise. Yes

154
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,170
I did just say that. You know it's all out the window at this

155
00:20:42,170 --> 00:21:28,839
point. Who cares? God damn it. All right let's go.

156
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:33,160
Non-canon spoilers. I never thought I'd get to do something so important.

157
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:42,390
What the hell are you up to TK?

158
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,549
Frank West is back complete with his photo journalistic skills. Ready the

159
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:48,630
camera by holding down left trigger? Yeah.

160
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,940
And tapping right bumper. Release left trigger to put the camera away.

161
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,670
Erotica, horror, outtake, drama, and brutality.

162
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,220
That's from the last one right? Take photos when you see the yellow pp icons.

163
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,319
They will get you even more pp. Lock in your favorite pictures in the

164
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,529
picture viewer. Yeah I remember that. New photos automatically overwrite

165
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:20,779
unlocked photos. Ready camera by holding

166
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:28,519
LT and tapping right bumper. Right.

167
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:44,069
Got you. What is that?

168
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:58,869
Got it. All right I got what I needed. That's TK and Brandon. Don't look.

169
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:17,269
That's a special special. Better angle up here.

170
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:20,069
Is that a bomb?

171
00:23:39,210 --> 00:24:02,490
Dead Rising 2 spoils off the record. Got him. All right this is it. I got the

172
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:12,599
briefcase switch. How could they ignore me doing this?

173
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,200
Not good. I gotta zoom in. Jump down to get a better shot. I don't

174
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:27,269
count. I think I can jump down. Got it. You're playing for Super Mario

175
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:33,750
2 as Luigi. Oh all right. I'm all right with that.

176
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:52,950
Gotta get back to my show. Well looky here. Hey you're a little late for

177
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,130
the autographs. I was just looking for the men's room.

178
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:06,900
Story of my life. No. Dude that is so funny.

179
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:20,700
Is it like a dodge roll or something? Third run?

180
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,859
He just spit on me. I know that technique from the last game.

181
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:47,289
This guy's the same size.

182
00:25:50,069 --> 00:26:02,470
Wait it's scripted. It's scripted. I think you've overstayed your welcome a bit

183
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:15,609
Frankie. Call me if you're for a photo shoot.

184
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:28,380
Who is that? Chuck is a man of god and doesn't have scenes like this.

185
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,519
You must have to take pills for that at your age.

186
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:37,240
Dude I'm sorry the stream pre-orders had me thinking a completely different

187
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:45,750
thing. Well good night ladies.

188
00:26:45,750 --> 00:27:09,529
This is a sex game. Blood suckers. There's a 45 minute long sex scene.

189
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:19,980
Imagine how imagine trying to get that into a game.

190
00:27:19,980 --> 00:28:04,180
It would never happen. It's unskippable.

191
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:09,990
Gotta get one. Horror horror horror horror horror.

192
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:22,859
Oh Tom Terry. That was quick. Alice is dead. Well I can't save

193
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:28,650
everybody. All right well let's go.

194
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:44,460
Anything in here? There's food in here. Not saving anybody. Omega lull. We can't.

195
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:51,779
All right fire axe. No keep fire axe. He's so

196
00:28:51,779 --> 00:29:06,250
red. This actually got a little stupid.

197
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:29,509
Why how did it get on my back? Go in here.

198
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:39,829
Yep that's pretty good. No what are you doing?

199
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:46,119
Hey there handsome. Take off those shoes now.

200
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:50,970
This first second I'm able to the shoes are coming off. Anything else in here?

201
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,960
No let's go.

202
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:12,940
Is there this throwing in this game right? Dale.

203
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,900
Dale's dead. I just triple tapped that guy.

204
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,940
Is this money on the ground? Wait what is this? Keys?

205
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:36,569
Security box? Wait Jeremiah.

206
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:53,799
Did he like run his head into a spike? All right I'm coming to think that you

207
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:57,240
can't actually do anything. Pat and Lucas.

208
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,059
They just keep coming. I can't do anything about it.

209
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:12,950
Oh fuck.

210
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,569
It's decent.

211
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:31,289
Andrea can I do anything? Why are there grenades everywhere?

212
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:50,920
Don't use grenades in close proximity guys. We have five community subs coming

213
00:31:50,920 --> 00:32:08,119
from Kazoo. One of these is Chuck.

214
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:26,359
There's Chuck. All right get in the safe house.

215
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:53,460
Chuck. Do I make it into the elevator? We'll find out.

216
00:32:53,539 --> 00:33:04,980
Sort of jogged right in. Time to break the bank Vegas style.

217
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:16,579
By the way this is Vegas. I can't get a signal. Why?

218
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:20,279
Why can't I get a signal? It's because you don't have Verizon.

219
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,480
She was looking right at me and they found her and I couldn't do anything.

220
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,559
She went down without a sound and I had to get out of there. I just

221
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:53,579
ran. He does look like Dan Aykroyd. Whoa whoa.

222
00:33:53,579 --> 00:34:01,579
Name's Frank. Frank West. Oh you're the big shot from Willamette.

223
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:07,799
Yeah. I seen you on tv. I don't take this the wrong way but

224
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:12,969
ain't you affected? Hey don't worry.

225
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:18,260
It's under control. Zombrex. You better have three days work.

226
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,829
You seem real nice. I'd hate to have to put a bullet in your head.

227
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:29,210
Uh thanks. We ain't got these Zombrex here.

228
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,889
Military have to quarantine first. They'll enter the city at first light

229
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:39,619
three days from now to get all of us. That's the standard procedure. So we're

230
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,980
stuck here. Where is he keeping that Zombrex?

231
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,300
Not out there. What you think? Probably down the front of his pants.

232
00:34:47,300 --> 00:35:23,769
Damn it. I'm already out of coffee. What a disaster.

233
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:30,550
Orange juice. I've already seen it. Didn't he just say we don't have any

234
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:39,019
Zombrex? I know where you can get some Zombrex.

235
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:44,969
Collie Brady thanks for the five subs. Thanks for the five community subs.

236
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:48,820
I figured you were infected. Though I don't remember you saying anything about that in your book.

237
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:56,840
Well it's not exactly something I'd go around. There's a pharmacy

238
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,719
in the royal flesh mall. Back to the mall. I'm Stacy Borsig by the way.

239
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:07,159
I'm Frank. Frank. Frank West. Plenty of people know you.

240
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:11,980
Do you know a way out of here? No but if you find one

241
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,300
I suggest you take this. That way we can keep in touch.

242
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,730
There's closed circuit cameras all over the city. These monitors are playback only.

243
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,730
But I'll keep an eye on them. Bluetooth headset. Those must have just come out

244
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,409
right? Frank, if you find anyone alive out there.

245
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:46,760
I've got experience rounding up survivors. Hello?

246
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,400
Okay got the map. Find Zombrex. Here we go. You've just reached a checkpoint. These

247
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,840
occur throughout Fortune City. Whenever you see checkpoint reached you

248
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,099
have reached a checkpoint. Right. Save often if you quit your current

249
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:08,039
game or power off you will lose your checkpoint.

250
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:14,219
Okay. The military will arrive in three days to contain the zombie outbreak.

251
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:17,260
Of course. Keep track of how much time is left. Press

252
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,010
the select to check the watch right? Always remember that Frank needs

253
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:28,309
Zombrex every 24 hours. Oh shit. The transceiver will let you

254
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:32,679
receive co-op calls. Well we're not going to be doing that.

255
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,360
People can drop in for a co-op game at any time. You can restrict who joins in

256
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,539
the gameplay options. Explore Fortune City with a friend and

257
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:46,340
slaughter even more undead. Me and Star played this like five years

258
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,849
ago. But we only made it about an hour or two

259
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:59,030
into the game I think. All right so uh where are we at?

260
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,300
I should check out Roy's Mart in Royal Flush Plaza.

261
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,900
Right. That's the destination I've got until

262
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:12,409
uh 8 a.m. You got it. How do I pick up the uh

263
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:16,730
how do I put up the watch?

264
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:26,440
8 a.m. Eastern time? Sounds like it. All right. Give it this flashlight.

265
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,119
Just give me like a give me a palette. No. Give me a piece of wood.

266
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:40,820
All right. How do I throw? What's the throw object?

267
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,610
It's not right trigger. Left bumper? Right bumper?

268
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:53,619
Right trigger? How do you throw?

269
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,699
All right. Fuck. Who cares? You can't throw inside the safe room. Okay. Right.

270
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:11,219
Right. How many safe slots do I get? I have to be really careful then. I have

271
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:19,800
I get three slots. I had like 10 in Dead Rising.

272
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:28,650
At least six. Right. I remember being down here and just throwing shit at each

273
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:41,179
other. You get 12 slots in original Dead Rising

274
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:44,150
too. Sounds like a much better game. You can't

275
00:39:44,150 --> 00:40:06,650
keep Frank West bottled up. All right. What is it with me and Vince?

276
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:13,289
Zombrex. So I need to go to here. So we go straight out. Bang a left.

277
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:20,420
Just make our way over there. I guess. I got nothing else to do. So that. Okay.

278
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:26,139
There it is. Saw blades. What's in the box?

279
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:34,820
Just more saws. Can they stack in this game? No they don't. All right. Let's go.

280
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,179
Oh there's a shovel though. I'm gonna replace flashlight with. No. Handbag with

281
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:42,099
shovel. That's much. Does it have a super punch?

282
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:55,079
Yep. How do I bring up the watch? Isn't it? Wasn't it left on the d-pad?

283
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,000
Stacy will send you messages about the interesting things she sees happening

284
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,500
around Fortune City. Each mission has a time limit. Right.

285
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,539
You can track the time limits on the mission queue

286
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:09,940
on the HUD or in the watch screen. Right. Messages will lead you to survivors of

287
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,500
the zombie outbreak scattered around the city. Yes they will.

288
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:24,170
And that's urgent. Frank. I flush Plaza. Royce Mart is on the other side of the mall.

289
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:33,110
Blast. Things that I don't say on a. There's slot machines in this game.

290
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,230
Welcome to Fortune City where money is king. People come to Fortune City to win

291
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,389
big. You'll never know when you'll need some

292
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:41,820
money. Smashing ATMs and slot machines can earn

293
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,500
you easy money. Earn even more by playing winning slot

294
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,510
machines. Collect gambling magazines for a lucky

295
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:54,179
boost. Look out for money cases and security

296
00:41:54,179 --> 00:42:00,619
box keys. They can lead you to big cash rewards if you see one. Grab it.

297
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:06,519
So there's money in this game. Okay. What's that? I have like two of these.

298
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:17,750
Okay. Can I see how many of these I have? All right. Let's do it. Shoes. Off.

299
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:25,829
In closet. My favorite place to be. All right. We'll just let a brick. This is

300
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:41,019
bricks in this game. I want a brick. You can throw bricks? Yeah.

301
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:49,079
I think I've had the same reaction. What a pathetic throw. He threw that

302
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:58,019
like it weighed 10 times more than it does.

303
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:09,110
I have to hit somebody in the face with this. Got it. Okay. I can move on.

304
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:16,039
What else is in here? Vinyl records. Large soda.

305
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:19,719
Register. Smash the register.

306
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:39,480
Wow. You actually do collect money. Gun. Get the foam finger. Red spray paint.

307
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,409
I need a big game. Okay. I gotta go. How do guns work in this game?

308
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:49,510
Are they just as horrible? They're pretty good. They're not bad.

309
00:43:49,510 --> 00:44:02,460
All right. Let's go find. Let's just do this because I'm here.

310
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:25,849
You can walk and aim. You can walk and aim. What's that? Sporting Good Store?

311
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:48,440
Come on. It's my turn. What? I need the hammer. Any hammers in here?

312
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:56,840
They're MMA gloves. All right. Okay. I'm gonna get. I'm gonna use the MMA gloves.

313
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:05,079
Boxing gloves. Do I get experience for this?

314
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:50,389
Holy shit. I actually did. Thousand. Come on. Break. Two completely different

315
00:45:50,389 --> 00:46:05,190
recorded voice lines for the same thing. That's Spider-Man PS4 levels of awesome.

316
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:14,699
Okay. All right. Get out of my way. Orange juice is way better than soda.

317
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:24,570
The truck only has three recorded voice lines.

318
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:34,760
Does it only have one? That kind of sucks.

319
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:45,989
It's a giant craps table. This game is cool. Can I actually do this?

320
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:58,230
Can I actually play craps? Come on. What do I get? Four.

321
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:13,380
I have to bet. How do I bet? I gotta put a bet down.

322
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:23,769
Oh shit. That's outside of the playing area. I have to go get chips.

323
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:27,610
Okay. I'm gonna get addicted to some stuff in here. It's gonna be crazy.

324
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:40,469
I like the the feedback on that gun. We got jewelry store.

325
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:47,449
Money. Gems. Can I just like convert this into money?

326
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:58,179
Presents? Get off me you motherfucker.

327
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:09,590
Shopping boxes. All right. I don't want to run out of time.

328
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:13,750
There's a car. There's a car in the mall. And this is a drivable car.

329
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:22,500
In the mall. They're already. Oh come on.

330
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:30,010
I need shit that exists. It actually exists.

331
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:51,349
I just won 1200 bucks. All right. I'm done. Oh god. He's addicted. I just won

332
00:48:51,349 --> 00:49:06,710
1200 dollars and got him walked away. Here. Am I going the right way?

333
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:20,699
Uh yes. It's right here. You sprayed on yourself first.

334
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:25,099
I want some more. I want some more coffee. Shit.

335
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:54,809
I just got like a little one. Hey. You have something better to do.

336
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:58,199
Why don't you mind your own business old man?

337
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:01,719
Just looking for some meds. No need to get ugly.

338
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:06,360
Well you're definitely gonna need some painkillers when I'm done with you.

339
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,360
Well talking to you is giving me a headache. Crowbar is not a great weapon.

340
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,199
What say you? Hard to swing. It's heavy. And I'll go get some for you.

341
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:22,300
Yeah. Give us some money grandpa. We'll help you.

342
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:29,179
Just a block of wood. It's actually. Do you know how heavy a crowbar actually is?

343
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,980
It turned your fucking friends green. Completely green.

344
00:50:51,260 --> 00:51:09,320
Why did I call me grandpa? I'm like 41. I've had enough. I thought he was gonna drink it.

345
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,400
I thought he was gonna drink it. I was gonna let him take a sip.

346
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,179
Psycho. I was gonna let him get a nice swig before he died.

347
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:47,219
Crowbar. Double crowbar and hatchet. Oh shit. You're alive. All right hold on.

348
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:59,349
Do you mind if I take all this? Okay. I thought they were gonna kill me.

349
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:05,590
It's okay. You're safe now. Are you hurt? I think I'm okay. Thank you so much.

350
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:11,059
You got here before they. Before they. Listen. There's a safe house.

351
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:13,139
Well you'll be safe. Follow me and I'll take you there.

352
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:25,030
Dense? Is it Denise? Dense. There are survivors of the outbreak scattered through a fortune city.

353
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,130
Escort anyone you find back to the safe house. Though some might not come with you willingly.

354
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,289
Why is to call a survivor? Or you can press left trigger and y to send them to a location, right?

355
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:47,989
Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Follow me. Agreed. Hurry it up. Let's get the Zombrex. Anybody else here?

356
00:52:51,019 --> 00:53:01,369
Zombrex. Frank will need a Zombrex at 8 a.m. It is high in demand, expensive, and hard to find.

357
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:08,659
The new and improved Zombrex formula lasts 24 hours. Zombrex overdoses are deadly. Oh no.

358
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:18,250
Users must never take it earlier than prescribed. I'm gonna have to save all the time.

359
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:22,650
The Zombrex counter on your HUD shows how much you have at all times.

360
00:53:23,289 --> 00:53:28,250
Frank needs Zombrex every day between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. If he doesn't get it, he will die.

361
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:35,539
So every day at 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. just scream at me. Check your watch to see if it's time

362
00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:46,630
for your next dose. Okay. I have Zombrex. It's too early to inject myself. I can only inject

363
00:53:46,630 --> 00:54:00,389
myself between 7 and 8 a.m. Give me that orange juice. Oh, I remember the computer. The computer

364
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:16,489
joke. It's all coming back to me. A defib. You alive? Now you're extra alive. All right. Let's

365
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:21,909
go. Quick. Follow me. Oh, there's orange juice everywhere, but I don't really need it. Actually,

366
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:32,019
you know what? Yeah, I'm gonna take another one. Let's go. So I need to take that Zombrex.

367
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:41,340
Actually, I should. Can you have the weapon? Here, come here. Give item. Here. I mean, like,

368
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:53,210
you're the doctor, so you take this. What? You're the doctor. You'll take an axe, but you won't take

369
00:54:53,210 --> 00:55:07,269
a defib? All right. Okay. Uh, guide arrow. I need to go back to the safe house. Uh, is it already

370
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:19,860
guiding me? Or is this just, I have to take Zombrex at 7 a.m.? I swing. I swing down. Holy

371
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:32,250
shit. She's actually attacking zombies. All right. Um, where's the safe house from here?

372
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:40,659
Can I not move around? There we go. So, uh, safe house is, what is it? It's the green one.

373
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:48,840
Can I zoom out a little bit? It was back here, wasn't it? All right. I'm gonna set a waypoint

374
00:55:48,840 --> 00:56:01,559
to here. Let's go back to the safe house. You all right? All right, let's move. We gotta go.

375
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:17,019
The bare feet can be accessed through the locker in the safe house. I love how that's being spammed.

376
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,179
Jeremy, bare feet. Is that available? Bare feet available.

377
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:44,539
What are you talking about? I feel like I'm superhero from Mystery Men.

378
00:56:46,650 --> 00:57:03,719
I'm the defense. He's a wrestler. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is one of the,

379
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:06,840
this is one of the people that they passed on during that whole montage. They're trying

380
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:21,289
to find superheroes. Look like Deadpool 2. Pick one. Come on. Speed it up. Keep up. Hey, I'm

381
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:31,429
waiting on you. Yeah. Deadpool 2 for zoomers. Mystery Men for boomers. I'm, I can, I make sure

382
00:57:31,429 --> 00:57:52,039
that I address all audiences. She's like dead. Don't die. I can't lose the first survivor.

383
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:09,349
Right through there. Maybe get an actual weapon. I'm fine. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die.

384
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:32,500
I thought she just had a giant syringe for a second. Did somebody just say Monka S bare feet?

385
00:58:34,230 --> 00:59:04,219
Why is that? Firecrackers. Dance. Look, those guys were stealing everything. Thanks for saving my

386
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:21,289
life. Where on earth did you find them? Nevermind. I don't want to know. We can't afford to have any

387
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:28,170
more infected in here. One's enough. Okay. Hey, any, where can I change into bare feet around here?

388
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:35,190
What the fuck are you talking about, Frank? Just take off your damn shoes and socks. What are you

389
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:40,760
talking about? Earned PP by killing zombies. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Let's you level up. Yep. Leveling

390
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,199
up, up, up, up. Let's you gain new skills, attributes, and even combo cards. Yes, it does.

391
00:59:49,670 --> 01:00:10,389
New skill. Roundhouse kick. Hold right trigger and hold A. Drill bucket? Wait, what do you mean

392
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:30,519
combo cards? Pylon and spray paint is a bullhorn. Okay. Uh, status. Skills. Jump kick. Yeah.

393
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:37,739
Dodge roll. Click left stick. Good to know. Roundhouse. Hold right trigger and hold A.

394
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:49,690
All right. So what's the problem? Hold right trigger and hold A. I'm in the safe house. Nevermind.

395
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:59,050
All right. So, um, what time is it? I got to inject myself. It is 6 17 a.m. I have to take

396
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:21,510
an injection in like 15 minutes. This is fine. Safe house fun. Just chilling before an injection.

397
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:43,369
That's right. All right. What is that? Which one is it? This one here? The locker? Sweet.

398
01:01:43,849 --> 01:02:00,969
Okay. Oh, I just put on like tap shoes. Oh, whatever. All right. Time check. It is 6 30.

399
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:05,380
Time to take an injection in a few minutes. Just going here. There's probably a cut scene here

400
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:16,300
after as well. Glad you found some zombricks, but it's not time to take it yet. I need my daily dose

401
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:32,300
between 7 and 8 a.m. I'll take it then. Can you take this anywhere? Can you hear me? Can anyone

402
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:43,989
hear somebody? Somebody. Don't run with scissors. This is a zombie outbreak. All right. 6 35 a.m.

403
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:54,570
Give me the fire extinguisher too. And okay. Cool. Hey, is the Star Wars game any good?

404
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:05,239
Anyone like know anything about it? The one, the one just coming out like in three days,

405
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:20,150
four days, whatever it is. Is it good? Anybody know? That's a lot of orange juice. All right.

406
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:29,460
Few minutes. I can take it. How the fuck are we supposed to know? I don't know. Have you guys been

407
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,980
paying attention to it? I don't know. Did anybody like play it? Any, any journalists in here?

408
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:38,940
Although that you can't even tell me anyways because you're probably under like an NDA.

409
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:51,460
The previews look good. I don't know. I just know it's coming out in a few days. I don't know if

410
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,139
some games, the review copies have already been out for a while. Maybe I just didn't know if

411
01:03:55,139 --> 01:04:08,280
those views are out or who's there? All right, we go. 651 incoming. Reviews come out on Thursday.

412
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:32,150
All right. 653 incoming. Drama. Go do stuff. I feel like I'm gonna have to be right here. All

413
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:46,699
right. I've got only got like an hour. I'm done. It's time to take it. You can do it anywhere.

414
01:04:46,699 --> 01:04:56,710
Oh, okay. Okay. Well, it says destination safe house and that doesn't know the destination is

415
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:17,400
7 a.m. That's it. Okay. So now what? Start at 8 a.m. Nothing to do now. But wait, Stacey will call me.

416
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:41,380
Fuck. All right. Well, let's set a waypoint to, um, let's go out to, is it a gas station?

417
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:54,760
That's a car. Whatever. Just go this way. Go out and try the sweet roundhouse kit. Get the scissors

418
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:06,579
suck. Just don't gamble for an hour. No, I'm not. I'm just gonna go kill stuff

419
01:06:06,579 --> 01:06:25,210
and go find some more costume stuff. Okay. Well, I can. Hey, I can take you right now.

420
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,119
Lady, it's Sandra Dawkins and hell no, I ain't all right. My good-for-nothing husband left me out

421
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:38,579
here. I remember this part. Don't you have to? Okay. I've played the first couple hours of this

422
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:48,539
game. Okay. Watch out behind you. Watch out behind you. Watch out behind you. Watch out behind you.

423
01:06:49,500 --> 01:07:03,820
All right, let's go. All right. What did you say? Oh, you got a weapon. Oh, yeah. You got like a

424
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:20,699
wrench. Oh, my. I'm hitting her in the head over and over again. All right. Um, I didn't, I, where

425
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:42,570
was it? Was it right here? It's like right here, isn't it? Cafe. Casual gals.

426
01:07:47,989 --> 01:07:59,300
Keep up. Here. Take some orange juice. Here. Take orange juice. I'm trying to stop. I know. You're

427
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:19,140
locked in. Like aggression is taking over. Come here. No. Gordon Dawkins. There you are.

428
01:08:29,619 --> 01:08:34,970
All right. Come here. Come here. I hate to break up this lovely reunion, but this is not safe out here.

429
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:49,300
Take this. He's right. Let's go. Yes, dear. Gordon has joined. Here. Take. Drink it. Okay, you have

430
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:58,260
this back. No, no, no. Come back. Come back. No. Take this back. Take this back. Take this back.

431
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:09,619
Yes, use that. Take it. No, I didn't want to. Okay. Okay. Well, we've all been well fed.

432
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:20,539
Take this. Okay. Let's move. You want orange juice or what? All right. Back to the safe house.

433
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:45,420
Let's go. That way. Let's go. Roundhouse kick. It's a pretty shitty roundhouse kick. It's really,

434
01:09:45,420 --> 01:10:09,930
it's too low. Let's go. Frank is my age. How old is Frank in this game? 50. Follow me. You guys

435
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:20,140
making it? Yeah. Can I have, give me your stuff back? I want that back. Sorry. Why does nobody

436
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:36,699
want this? I want to throw them. Keep up. It's because it sucks. Urgent. Frank, they're starting

437
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:43,779
to report the outbreak on the news. You should come back and watch this. All right. Well, let's

438
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:52,149
go back to the safe house. Two more people. It's all that we have received a broadcast from our

439
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:59,539
Phil Kachang who is inside Fortune City. Don't tease me like that.

440
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:09,140
I wish I could drink that right now. I love just shitty dirty

441
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,140
coffee pot coffee. It's like my favorite thing.

442
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:23,619
Okay. This is how fucked up my brain is. I was about to like just send Kim a text.

443
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:29,699
Hey, could you throw on a pot of coffee for me? And I opened up Twitter

444
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:32,500
and was about to write, Hey, can you throw a pot of coffee on for me?

445
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:50,680
That the man is reality as their complete no statement of response has been received.

446
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:55,399
This horrible act of terror appears to be an escalation of violence for the protest

447
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:11,539
group. This is the picture on that screen. Where the hell did that come from? Liar. It came from

448
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:19,220
the security cameras, lady. What the hell were you thinking? Your group's got a reputation,

449
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:26,250
but come on. Cure had nothing to do with this. It's pretty easy to say that, isn't it? You're

450
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:35,159
going to need more than that. Better start talking, right? I'm telling you, we're being set up. We've

451
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:38,600
been accused of things before, but we don't believe in violence. Did I just send that to the wrong

452
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,520
fucking person? It's someone's convenient excuse. No, really. What am I going to say? What is wrong

453
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,720
with me? It's not the first time members of Cure have been falsely accused of being involved with

454
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:57,460
an outbreak. I've got to find whoever leaked that tape. Like an old real estate agent or something.

455
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:08,779
Hey, can you put a pot of coffee on for me? What's going on with this game?

456
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:15,479
Where is she? She said she was in the hotel. I know this could end up being a big chance for

457
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:20,600
your career. It's not internet related. It's just... This could mean my life. Video game

458
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:32,810
hardware reception. Level up. New skill move acquired. All right. Case one two engaged.

459
01:13:33,529 --> 01:13:43,560
I need to find out what that Rebecca Chang knows. We got it. Would you like to save your progress?

460
01:13:43,560 --> 01:14:02,180
Sure, I would. Dead rising for the switch. Pretty great, actually. You found yourself caught in the

461
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:05,699
Fortune City outbreak. Track down clues to uncover the truth about what happened.

462
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:14,659
Restore your name and escape from the city. Okay. Time until the military comes 72 hours 56 minutes

463
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:29,609
55 seconds. Leveled up. All right. Back to exploring. All right. That's really cool.

464
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:35,289
What move did I just learn? Find the reporter in the Fortune City hotel. I need to find that

465
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:43,079
reporter in the hotel lobby. You got it. But for now, but first front kick. Hold R T and press A.

466
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:52,710
I got... I'm good. Get out of my way. Maintenance room key acquired.

467
01:14:55,479 --> 01:15:01,300
Maintenance room key acquired. Promise everyone. Maintenance room key lets you access all maintenance

468
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:04,819
rooms in Fortune City. Maintenance rooms will let you make powerful combo weapons.

469
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:09,699
Maintenance rooms are located throughout Fortune City. Bright red doors and neon signs are easily

470
01:15:09,699 --> 01:15:15,239
visible from a distance. Good. Maintenance room is always within reach. Just check your maintenance

471
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:20,899
rooms map. They're always marked with the wrench icon. Cool.

472
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:41,109
Take it. It's yours. Thanks. Okay. So they have... Oh, they all have little things on them.

473
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:43,829
There's a guy playing the slots. Okay. You don't have to read it.

474
01:15:47,779 --> 01:15:50,100
I'll go check on him. I'll go sit down with him and join him.

475
01:15:53,340 --> 01:16:04,970
Know when to fold them. I'm going to go join this guy. So that means it can be combined. That's

476
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:38,039
cool. All right. Let's craft. Yeah, let's do it. Know when to fold the slots. Spiked Bat is

477
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:43,159
baseball bat in box of nails. Combo cards give you the recipe to build powerful combo weapons.

478
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:48,279
Cards you have found are all in the combo card screen. Killing with combo weapons gives you

479
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:55,399
bonus PP. You can level up faster and kill more zombies. So that's like... I want to make that

480
01:16:55,399 --> 01:17:00,600
thing. That's like Barney the dinosaur eating a bunch of rocket pops. Whatever that thing does.

481
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,600
Explosions. Fireworks. Try building more combo weapons using items from around the city. They're

482
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:12,310
easy to spot. They all have a wrench. Speaking of which, I want one of those bad. All right.

483
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:41,239
Let's see what I got. DFib. Baseball bat and DFib. They only combo if they blow. Oh. All right.

484
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:55,060
Well, can I do anything with this? DFib and bucket. DFib and cone. How about cone and bucket?

485
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:09,420
What would that make? A bigger bucket? All right. I got my spiked bat. Wait. Oh, thousands.

486
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:17,140
How many gallons of milk do I have in my fridge right now? I don't like, I don't have like none.

487
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:22,920
I don't have like regular milk. Regular milk gives you diarrhea. It does to me.

488
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:29,579
What you got? One of those looters. Looks like one of those looters has set up a pawn shop inside

489
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:36,810
Moe's imaginations. He might have something for you. Okay. Well, I need to, we gotta go because

490
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:57,579
just trying to get pp with poor Grace. Nice shitty weapon. They can only be combined. I'll

491
01:18:57,579 --> 01:19:12,140
figure out the combinations. What? Holy shit. Oh man. They have different, oh that's awesome.

492
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:24,119
They don't got this shit in the base game, do they? Yes, they do. I know.

493
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:48,489
I know. I know. Is it a wheelchair? Wait. Funny costume stuff. Can I put it on? Kids superhero

494
01:19:48,489 --> 01:20:08,659
boots. This is like Santa wakes up at 3 a.m. to drink milk out of the fridge. Which by the way,

495
01:20:08,659 --> 01:20:20,810
gross. And what's the point of having, all right, I, this button's at the top. But what on earth

496
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:24,649
are the buttons on the back for? Is that to change, is that to change like a diaper or something?

497
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:36,819
I don't know. I've never known what that is for. This is to poo. Why we, that's disgusting.

498
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:57,859
What the hell was that? Who's talking? I hear somebody talking. It's a onesie. Look at the top.

499
01:20:57,859 --> 01:21:00,420
It buttons all the way down to the, to the, to like the crockery area.

500
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:22,260
Shit, this is ridiculous. Okay. Somebody's in it. Get out of the way. Wait, this is a whole casino.

501
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:25,220
Oh no, I'm never going to get out of here. I'm never going to be able to leave.

502
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:44,680
Oh shit. Okay. I got to find this guy. Don't play any of these machines. It's a waste of money.

503
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,779
This roulette, you can actually play roulette. No, you can't.

504
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,420
Damn it. I thought I had the big one for sure. Oh well, I'll go again.

505
01:21:57,689 --> 01:22:10,390
Bill, Bill, we got to talk. Bill, buddy, you doing okay? I like slots too, but you might want to

506
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:15,430
wait things out the safe house. That's a nice idea. But I got money to win back. I ain't leaving

507
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:25,800
without it. Might not be the best time with all these zombies around. Hang on there sweetie. Good

508
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:32,279
things come to those who wait. You can gamble. Why don't you just break them? Just smash them.

509
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:38,569
You can run along to your safe house and be like, I'm down $20,000 and I'm not going

510
01:22:38,569 --> 01:22:47,529
anywhere until I have made that money back. Oh my, I have to give you $20,000? What if I break

511
01:22:47,529 --> 01:23:04,020
his machine? How about another $5,000? Bill, a little advice for you. There's some pretty

512
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:15,899
greedy folks here in Fortune City. Might do well to keep some cash handy. Bill, here. Okay. Well,

513
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:31,579
take the knife. All right. Now watch out. Let me show you how it's done. Hey, back up.

514
01:23:43,460 --> 01:24:13,020
Come on. One more. I didn't mean to drink the fucking orange juice. I meant to switch to the

515
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:24,359
bad. I got it all back. Don't worry. Okay, let's go. Bill, come with me. Case one, two. Not yet.

516
01:24:25,239 --> 01:24:30,039
One man's trash. We're close. Not that close, but see if we can do it. This is the pawn shop.

517
01:24:30,760 --> 01:25:04,119
Holy shit, there's a bolt. Ride the thunder. What do I win? $2,000. Oh shit. I'm wasting all my money.

518
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:16,060
$5,000.

519
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:38,779
It's like just my sweat covered hands is what happened. All right, Bill, let's go.

520
01:25:42,920 --> 01:26:05,100
Drinking all the drinks. No. Let's go to the pawn shop. Bill, are you good?

521
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:22,170
It's time for the casino later. Who cares about Bill? I'm going to get the PP from Bill. He was

522
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:46,390
$25,000. 70 hours. All right, let's get this pawn shop. The knife sucks. I need to combine

523
01:26:46,390 --> 01:27:06,859
this to make a better knife. This thing's terrible. No. I gotta get Bill some food.

524
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:32,890
You can do it. Snacks over here probably, right? $100 for snacks? Quick, eat, eat, eat.

525
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:58,710
No, I'm trying to pick up the bat. Bill. Bouncing beauty. Propane tank and rocket fireworks.

526
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:23,029
Eat these. All right, I need to get that fucking bat. Here, take this. Keep moving.

527
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:37,560
All the health you just gained is gone. How do you not? He's lost more HP. Bill's gonna die.

528
01:28:37,560 --> 01:29:07,579
You were $20,000, Bill. My chest. God damn it. Shit. Loot him. He had a gun this whole time?

529
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:33,319
Holy shit, he had multiple guns. Bill, I just want the gun. Get away from me. Go. All right, out.

530
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:57,689
Save scum? No, I can't save scum. No save scumming. It's my own damn fault. Holy, I just got that

531
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:01,930
guy from across the world. All right, one man's trash. Here we go. Stuff for sale.

532
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:10,979
See what I just did? Wait a minute, you. You're one of those punks that tried to jump me in Roy's

533
01:30:10,979 --> 01:30:18,390
Mart. Whatever. Might have been one of my pals, grandpa. We're just businessmen seeking out

534
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:24,649
merchandise for our shop. Feel free to browse any of our four pawn shops set up around Fortune

535
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:29,850
City. There's this one here and the others. We've got lots of valuable merchandise, pal. I wouldn't

536
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:42,899
turn your nose up at it. We can really help you out if a GM will do it. Let's go. Wacky hammer?

537
01:30:43,539 --> 01:31:02,500
Okay, I'll take a wacky hammer, please. Is this costing money? Soldier goggles. $2 million.

538
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:11,739
$1,000 bucks. 15,000. Zombrex. 50 grand. I need that. Hey, any leads? I can see two guys.

539
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:34,149
Can I wear this? What? Can I please wear this? How do I get on? How do I pedal?

540
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:44,970
Okay, yeah, I remember this. All right, let's see what we got. Welcome to the family. Let's do

541
01:31:44,970 --> 01:32:04,409
welcome to the family. Welcome to the family, son. This is slower than walking. This cannot

542
01:32:04,409 --> 01:32:12,710
go upstairs. That's next level. That deserves at least 2,000 pub champs in the chat, I think.

543
01:32:27,859 --> 01:32:45,750
Upgrade. All right, welcome to the family. Is everybody in the casino? I can't take this with

544
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:52,119
me. Oh, you guys are in the casino. Oh, damn it.

545
01:32:56,569 --> 01:33:06,869
Excuse me. Is it downgrade if you ask me? I know. What was the new move? Just a kick. Nice. It's

546
01:33:06,869 --> 01:33:35,289
pretty good. Atlantica. What's that on ground? Beer? I'll take a beer. It's the same thing

547
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:44,279
because it was a dolphin this time instead of a bull. How did I miss you? I have to drink beer now.

548
01:33:45,079 --> 01:34:10,550
You can combine it with Molotov, I'm assuming, right? Yeah. Treasure chest. Money. I'm just using

549
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:15,270
my wrist to try to break that. That's not going to happen. I don't want to break this. I'm going to

550
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:52,920
play them later. Get off of me. Dude, go on the pirate ship. Eventually. Pirate ship now. No,

551
01:34:52,920 --> 01:35:08,250
not yet. We'll get on the pirate ship in 15 minutes from now. We've got dynamic lighting in here and

552
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:25,670
it's making me drop down to like 50 fps. You're a shit PC. That's where you're wrong. I have

553
01:35:26,859 --> 01:36:02,229
a intermediate level PC. This is nice. Come on. All the way out. Whipped cream can?

554
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:29,140
What? Oh, wow. Really? Oh, I want to eat this. Why is there a chainsaw back here and a key?

555
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:37,270
Use blenders to mix food items together and to mix drinks. Yep.

556
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:42,939
I have special bonuses. There are different types of mixed drinks. Each one with its own special

557
01:36:42,939 --> 01:37:14,329
power. Yep. I gotta move. Where is this? In the corner? I dropped the chainsaw. How the

558
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:35,770
fuck did I do that? Get that dang thing off your head. I'm here. I brought the wheat cutter.

559
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:47,350
All right. Kenneth and Jack. Is that Proto Man? Is it Zero? Proto Man? Who is this? Are they all

560
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:53,460
gone? I hate those things. We gotta get out of here. They're more coming. I can get you to safety.

561
01:37:53,460 --> 01:38:01,260
Why is he looking at me like that with a knife out? What's he doing? What is he doing? I really

562
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:09,159
love my wife, but it's like he doesn't like me at all. Can you help? Thanks stranger. The name's

563
01:38:09,159 --> 01:38:13,640
Kenneth. Me and my loser for a son-in-law are trying to bond as my daughter says.

564
01:38:14,199 --> 01:38:20,520
Follow me back to the safe house. It's too dangerous out here. Sounds good, but my daughter

565
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:24,920
Casimina would probably kill me if something happened to her dimwit poker fiend of a husband.

566
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:31,109
Better see if he's up to leaving. He's the fool over there in the helmet. All right. We're all

567
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:49,779
going. Let's go. He's trying to kill me. I'm not like a snake, man. Stop. Let's go. I want to play

568
01:38:49,779 --> 01:38:59,300
a little poker. Let's go. Jack is joined. Kenneth is joined. Okay. Bowie knife. Here. You need this.

569
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:13,319
What else we got in here? Cleaver. Here. Stop like taunting at ringside. Here. Take this.

570
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:23,350
There's food. Anything else back here? There's like french fries and shit. Hold on.

571
01:39:24,149 --> 01:39:59,479
All right. Let's move back to the safe house. Take the bow and fucking arrow. This thing sucks.

572
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:18,810
That was a headshot. I have french fries and bow and arrows. The side. No, I'm taking the side.

573
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:40,859
This thing sucks. Take the claymore. Oh god damn it. Claymore? Where's a claymore? Oh fuck. There's

574
01:40:40,859 --> 01:40:56,229
a giant sword in here. Somebody open this. Where's the claymore? This is the claymore. I thought you

575
01:40:56,229 --> 01:41:00,550
meant a bomb. I thought you meant like an explosive like plastic claymore thing.

576
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:13,579
Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. He's played too much cod.

577
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:32,020
Kenneth. God damn it. Holy shit. People die so much quicker in this game. Take some french fries

578
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:45,430
before you die. Take some french fries quick please. All right. Let's go. Right. Take a lot.

579
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:57,859
There's a large soda here too. I can't man. I don't want to swing. Get them soda. Get the large soda.

580
01:42:03,239 --> 01:42:09,850
I look like I'm trying to be a Mega Man character by and saving money while doing so. All right.

581
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:34,659
Here. I want you at full health. Kenneth. Here. Just eat everything on the ground. All right.

582
01:42:34,659 --> 01:42:44,949
Any more? That's it? Here. You take the bone arrow. Idiot. All right. Let's go.

583

Save point. Where's one? All right. I'm right here. There is a save point. No. I gotta go back this way.

584
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:13,130
There's a save point right in the middle. Is there a bathroom? There's no damn bathroom over here.

585
01:43:16,569 --> 01:43:19,859
I have to go over here. Bang a right.

587
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:40,119
What is going on?

588
01:43:48,489 --> 01:44:03,210

589
01:44:08,789 --> 01:44:19,239
Meat. Bobby Hill? There are lots of zombies around here. Maybe she could eat those.

590
01:44:19,239 --> 01:44:36,090
No. Please. That meat is rotten. He needs meat. Fresh meat. Sure. Sure. I can get some fresh meat.

591
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:48,409
Steak. Maybe I'll go look for some. No. This guy's wearing like a leaf tarp for pants.

592
01:44:48,409 --> 01:45:06,250
People not been very good to me. Like snowflake. Snowflake my friend. Listen. Let's talk this over.

593
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:13,859
What's your name? Theodore. We talked about Dan Aykroyd before.

594
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:20,300
This is actually his Ghostbusters outfit when they when they're in their pajamas.

595
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:29,159
We just need to slow down this over Ted. And they don't have the actual like jumpsuit on. They're

596
01:45:29,159 --> 01:45:48,810
in that. See people not nice. This is really did I walk into a boss fight?

597
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:58,869
I have to fight a tiger. The last time I saved was so long ago.

598
01:46:02,619 --> 01:46:15,960
Oh this is bad. This is really bad. All right Jack. Kill him. Get him. Ted. Somebody.

599
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:24,470
Dude. That was fucking easy.

600
01:46:34,069 --> 01:46:46,260
The tiger sprinted away and then he stood there and got stun locked. No loyalty apparently.

601
01:47:23,079 --> 01:47:29,140
Wait was was this person not going to attack me?

602
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:45,100
The cat is uh fucking running around back there. Gems and leaf blower.

603
01:47:46,619 --> 01:47:51,180
Uh okay. So we need to get the fuck out of here.

604
01:47:54,859 --> 01:48:04,819
Uh all right let's go. Wait. A tiki torch. Okay. No I don't. Oh my god it's right in here.

605
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:10,329
Okay. No no no no. Run run run. Run run run. Run run. Is it a cat jump?

606
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:14,890
All right. Go go go go go. No no no no. Stop fighting the tiger.

607
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:36,380
Oh no please. Motherfucker. You opportunist asshole. I don't have any food.

608
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:53,399
Oh shit. I was supposed to save the game. Oh my god. I have to fucking. Give me a beer.

609
01:48:53,399 --> 01:48:59,319
Somebody. Do it. Fight something. Cat come. Can the cat come downstairs? Just beer on the ground.

610
01:49:09,829 --> 01:49:36,470
Meat on bone. Yeah they take so much more damage than this one. Jack dead. Jack dead. Feed the

611
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:46,949
tiger. Um I think I got more of a problem on my hands here. Feed tiger. Go tame the tiger. I'm

612
01:49:47,350 --> 01:50:03,420
dead. And so are these two guys that I'm with. They're both dead. How the fuck am I supposed to.

613
01:50:09,529 --> 01:50:14,659
Wait is it food? Holy shit. I thought these. I thought this was meat. I thought it was meat.

614
01:50:14,659 --> 01:50:40,739
It's foam hands. He's puking. He's dead man. It's over. Holy shit. This is a disaster.

615
01:50:41,699 --> 01:50:48,600
Oh I'm gonna die too. I'm just trying to save the damn game and I walk into a tiger.

616
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:11,380
Shit. Oh well. I gotta get in there. Uh Frank there seems to be a dancer throwing up in there.

617
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:45,779
So? What do you. The janitor. Somebody puked in the uh by the uh you know by the where's the gold

618
01:51:45,779 --> 01:52:18,409
slot machine. Uh I guess I'll take. Well sure. Very cool. All right. Wait what time is it?

619
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:27,659
So this is find the reporter which is straight ahead here. How much time do I have? Not very

620
01:52:27,659 --> 01:52:32,859
much but that's not that far away. The save point's right in the mill. I'm so sad right now.

621
01:52:34,779 --> 01:52:35,739
I'm so sad.

622
01:52:41,909 --> 01:52:58,520
I wanted to save those too. There's a weed whacker right here. There's a maintenance room in here.

623
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:16,840
Oh shit. Hold on. Excuse me. Goodbye. All right. So wait. Hold on. Place item. Wait. Knife and

624
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:36,789
battery? Wait a minute. Knife and. Knife and weed whacker. Holy shit. Okay. Um what can I do with

625
01:53:36,789 --> 01:53:46,229
bow and arrow? Bow and arrow and battery? Can I make like electric bow? Damn it. Lawnmower

626
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:56,069
and knife? Lawnmower and battery? Lawnmower and board of wood.

627
01:53:56,710 --> 01:54:22,090
Oh yeah. A port of mower. Scratch cards let you know what you need to make a combo weapon

628
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:28,359
but they're not as good as combo cards. Scratch cards mean less pp from combo weapons. You also

629
01:54:28,359 --> 01:54:34,199
cannot perform strong attacks. Replace your scratch cards with real combo cards as soon as you can.

630
01:54:36,039 --> 01:54:46,699
You can find combo cards everywhere. Scratch cards? Okay. Shit. I can only bring one

631
01:54:47,340 --> 01:55:01,770
which is better. Oh I gotta go. All right. Where's that save point right there?

632
01:55:02,489 --> 01:55:16,439
That's a lot of pp. Just in case I run into a huge problem.

633
01:55:23,909 --> 01:55:36,920
Okay let's go. Game is saved. You just have to bump into people with this.

634
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:54,250
Exactly. These things are actually great. You don't even need to use it. You're not killing them? I

635
01:55:54,250 --> 01:56:20,579
know but it's just I'm just trying to get through. Now what? Cat is back.

02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:36,630

journalism school could have fooled me hey bro what a mess well this just gets better and better

671
02:04:38,869 --> 02:04:43,590
going to school for journalism lol it looks like somebody didn't like the show much you should get

672
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:52,789
this on video you guys the internet may have changed a lot of things they didn't want us to

673
02:04:52,789 --> 02:05:06,220
see what really went down but like 15 20 years ago you couldn't do it on a computer zombies don't

674
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:13,159
use guns not so sure here's not involved but it definitely proves someone's covering up what

675
02:05:13,159 --> 02:05:21,800
really happened not a bad lead kiddo those pictures frank frank those are laptop motherboards

676
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:34,260
what is it stacy yeah he saw the report can you get back here wait who is that just a friend

677
02:05:34,819 --> 02:05:43,930
the leader of cure gotta go i gotta get out of here he can't ditch me for long that's what the

678
02:05:43,930 --> 02:06:02,149
lag i have no idea someone's destroyed the security room well i lose the game um okay so

679
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:14,600
i lose i have to go out i need heels i'm dead why did i break that i need the fucking

680
02:06:15,319 --> 02:06:29,189
just stuff inside i think i'm gonna i think i'm locked i think i'm locked out

681
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:46,500
so something that i didn't have to do in the last dead rising

682
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:49,079
uh but i'm probably gonna have to do here is

683
02:06:51,380 --> 02:06:57,350
you realistically replay dead rising like three or four times we might have to do that

684
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:17,689
let's go 100 bucks for cheetahs yeah that's kind of insane

685
02:07:17,689 --> 02:07:21,289
but i i don't know exactly how much time i have left it's not very much

686
02:07:21,289 --> 02:07:53,590
yes it's sort of possible it is it's maybe remotely possible how far away am i

687
02:07:55,979 --> 02:08:05,300
it's gonna be it's gonna be impossible but we'll see i might actually be able to do it if i just

02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:19,939
haul ass at the last save that i had use a wheelchair i'm about to lose yes damn it

720
02:17:39,059 --> 02:17:44,180
there's something else going on here sullivan i found some evidence at the arena of a cover-up

721
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:50,420
i've got a feeling tk the host of that game show was on the tv i saw him backstage at his show

722
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:54,420

just took him so long to die but if i was actually playing this game we're all dead instantly why

does it always happen like that okay so just make them wait make them wait if i leave them here

1042
03:37:56,170 --> 03:38:07,590
okay why do i have to go across the whole fucking game why and it's broken oh this is a disaster

1043
03:38:08,469 --> 03:38:28,469
this is a trillion zombies fire bomb i

1044
03:38:35,879 --> 03:38:42,489
all right so half the comments say just run the other half say

1045
03:38:43,610 --> 03:38:56,280
stop running fight what get in the car get in the car get in the back get in the car

1046
03:39:27,420 --> 03:39:34,379
he's alive how the fuck are you alive go over there how are you alive there's no way you're alive

1047
03:39:34,379 --> 03:39:57,180
man there's no way you gotta be fucking kidding me i can't fucking believe it are you serious

1048
03:40:02,420 --> 03:40:08,569
so you're telling me that if i just run like this and just don't stop they'll find a way to go

1049
03:40:08,569 --> 03:40:23,139
through the zombies but that doesn't make any sense because sometimes they do get caught

1050
03:40:30,940 --> 03:40:38,700
they just break free it's not like the first game

1051
03:40:59,059 --> 03:41:22,309
i can't believe it i can't believe it you just have to run and don't look at them

1052
03:41:23,209 --> 03:41:42,329
and they'll make it through thank you man he won the comedy trophy but he didn't win his life

1153
04:11:50,409 --> 04:11:56,579
why are you not stopping and healing them run run quick why did walter just take 5 000 points

1154
04:11:56,579 --> 04:12:18,040
of damage he took him into a swarm of zombies i thought that okay that's they're doing something

1155
04:12:18,040 --> 04:12:30,680
funny but it's i don't have time that i could keep going with 5 000 individuals that don't know how

1156
04:12:30,680 --> 04:12:53,959
to play games what are you talking this is for me not for them let's move keep up speed it up

there's someone cooking at kuchina danachi in the food court you better check it out you made it

1159
04:13:18,170 --> 04:13:41,139

1160
04:13:41,139 --> 04:13:49,000
bar you haven't heard this one have you all right 40 000 pp i would have gotten more but

1161
04:13:49,959 --> 04:14:00,739
i had to walk these idiots across the whole damn game let me save i had two people last time

1162
04:14:06,010 --> 04:14:12,440
although hold on let me be fair here for a second i'm gonna be really fair because i'm being very

1163
04:14:12,440 --> 04:14:21,190
unfair i tried to make them get hit by the pirate ship like five to ten times each this is very

1164
04:14:21,190 --> 04:14:30,170
unfair so that's a completely incorrect statement what i just said like i trying to get a photo of

1165
04:14:30,170 --> 04:14:46,659
them dying so i killed them okay um i'm accepting my my fault there and the picture wasn't even very

1166
04:14:48,340 --> 04:15:08,700
we're gonna go right in the middle just in case i get sad was the uh the picture viewer case file

1167
04:15:09,340 --> 04:15:43,959
no the other one was so much better unfortunately it was so good oh well you can pull it from the

1168
04:15:43,959 --> 04:15:52,760
stream yeah all right let me look at my combo cards okay machine gun and wheelchair

1169
04:15:57,739 --> 04:16:06,389
so case three one has a lot of time i need the zombrex pawn shop then there's also industrial

1178
04:17:15,510 --> 04:17:20,920

1187
04:19:29,959 --> 04:19:43,290
it's up i'm here to buy that zombrex it's a lot of money well there goes my retirement fund

1188
04:19:44,010 --> 04:19:59,239
um what the fuck is going on what is happening to me are they killing me

1189
04:20:06,329 --> 04:20:13,700
where am i i'm not in the vent there's just bombs being thrown

1190
04:20:43,879 --> 04:20:45,239
oh

1191
04:20:48,149 --> 04:21:06,870
give me a weapon give me a fucking weapon can i take a picture

1192
04:21:09,190 --> 04:21:21,579
what who is taking this photo wait wait wait wait don't kill me no i'm trying to get the

1193
04:21:21,579 --> 04:21:41,479
camera in the face the other way what do i do now take a picture of my own ass

1194
04:21:41,879 --> 04:21:53,000
oh zoom in i can't zoom in

1195
04:22:04,329 --> 04:22:36,149
um i'm outside no i'm not turn left left some more left turn left a little bit more i'm almost

1196
04:22:36,149 --> 04:23:26,870
outside i'm outside i think i just jumped off the balcony oh do i have a checkpoint after buying

1197
04:23:27,670 --> 04:24:04,870
the zombrex you didn't even get it yeah i did it's okay let's try this again so i'm trying to think

1198
04:24:04,870 --> 04:24:11,270
of how that may have i'm trying to think how that may have happened and the one thing i can think of

1199
04:24:11,270 --> 04:24:19,579
is when i bought the zombrex at the same exact time somebody tried to grab me and the game

1200
04:24:19,579 --> 04:24:27,739
freaked out one of those thieves tried to grab me right because that's what happens

1201
04:24:27,739 --> 04:24:36,250
and see what happens if we do this again because it was immediately right when i pressed the button

1202
04:24:36,889 --> 04:24:56,329
snacks all right up the stairs maybe it probably put me on the table that the zombrex is on

1203
04:24:56,329 --> 04:25:01,290
that's also another good theory atms here we go all right let's hope this doesn't happen again

1204
04:25:01,290 --> 04:25:31,659
because i'm about to get money out of the atm 40 grand okay this time here we are just wait a

1205
04:25:31,659 --> 04:25:45,459
second okay here he comes he made it in here much faster battle axe he's got one of those

1206
04:25:45,459 --> 04:25:54,420
devices too another one i'll take it um i how many how many he's getting

1207
04:26:00,100 --> 04:26:02,579
really he was these three

1208
04:26:05,700 --> 04:26:07,219
am i really that far away

1209
04:26:07,620 --> 04:26:13,829
so um

1210
04:26:17,829 --> 04:26:38,520
that's what this does items you fucking asshole what did he take oh god i just want to buy the

1211
04:26:38,520 --> 04:27:06,280
zombrex leave me alone hi oh no what is going on with this and i can't i can't change any

1212
04:27:06,280 --> 04:27:24,040
way weapons or anything go in the vent try a selfie so it's right holding right trigger and

1213
04:27:24,040 --> 04:27:36,040

1215
04:28:00,379 --> 04:28:13,270
i have it do i have doing i don't have the zombrex it's just on the ground there it is

1216
04:28:13,270 --> 04:28:26,420
is um i'm afraid to buy anything else the sports car keys a million dollars

1217
04:28:27,379 --> 04:28:38,409
should i get a paddle axe serve bot mask no like this is so bugged i gotta get out of this

1218
04:28:39,290 --> 04:28:46,059

1219
04:28:46,780 --> 04:29:17,510
game yeah that's also part of the plan that's also part of the plan atm show this evil people

1220
04:29:30,760 --> 04:29:37,079
bunch more money i could buy another one all right well not yet see if i can do this

1221
04:29:40,489 --> 04:29:58,100
i gotta save the game too let me eat some shit all right save game we're gonna go down

1222
04:29:59,620 --> 04:30:04,250

1223
04:30:32,579 --> 04:30:58,409
okay save the game uh i'm gonna end up triggering the cutscene i don't want to fight him right now

1224
04:30:58,409 --> 04:31:06,409
i'm gonna lose i mean should i just fight him how do i i don't have anything i got nothing to

04:44:33,419 --> 04:44:49,900
rake and battery electric rake it's a it's a little stabbing motion this might actually be

1696
06:52:43,479 --> 06:52:55,880
every single day we probably spend like three to four hours plus eating every day it's like

1697
06:52:55,880 --> 06:53:04,630
that's too much not time it next time the next even okay if you go no no seriously it takes

1698
06:53:04,630 --> 06:53:11,639
about it takes at least two to three hours to eat every meal it's not yeah it depends sometimes

1699
06:53:11,639 --> 06:53:18,360
if you okay if you like buy if you buy food from the grocery store and you make it that it takes

1700
06:53:18,360 --> 06:53:24,360
like 40 to 50 minutes sometimes to make food what if do you do you do you guys make food

1701
06:53:28,040 --> 06:53:37,209
half an hour this ain't rachel ray some of that shit works that's cooking not eating yeah but the

1702
06:53:37,209 --> 06:53:52,200
the act of eating requires the cooking so that's time that's added guys even craft macaroni and

1703
06:53:52,200 --> 06:54:04,889
cheese the orange box shit takes like 25 minutes to make to make it right what do you mean it does

1704
06:54:06,569 --> 06:54:12,580
how long does it take to boil water i think you guys don't understand time management skills

1705
06:54:13,299 --> 06:54:23,000
i play dead rising i know these things it takes like five to ten minutes to even boil a pot of

1706
06:54:23,000 --> 06:54:36,229
water you boil the water you put the macaroni in there let's see craft mac and cheese directions

1707
06:54:41,849 --> 06:54:46,090
you boil you make it doesn't take you three minutes to make craft mac and cheese

1708
06:54:46,650 --> 06:54:55,380
uh-huh bring six cups of water to a boil cook the macaroni for seven to eight minutes drain

1709
06:54:55,380 --> 06:54:59,139
the water from the macaroni that's another 20 30 40 seconds spinning on hot it is

1710
06:55:00,099 --> 06:55:04,979
place macaroni margarine milk and cheese sauce into the saucepan stir it up takes about two or

1711
06:55:04,979 --> 06:55:13,319
three minutes to stir that up and get it ready and then guess what you eat it out of that pot

1712
06:55:14,040 --> 06:55:24,299
so the second that it comes off the stove you go oh oh oh my mouth what you let it sit there for

1713
06:55:24,299 --> 06:55:30,619
like a few minutes so it cools down it takes like fucking 20 fucking it takes like fucking 20 fucking

1714
06:55:30,619 --> 06:55:39,290
minutes mate and then you have to sit there after eating like a whole a whole carton of craft mac

1715
06:55:39,290 --> 06:55:49,369
and cheese and you have to you do like the oh oh you said you did that for about 15 minutes

1716
06:55:49,369 --> 06:55:55,900
before you can even go back to work that's a 30 minute ordeal yeah that's just mac and cheese

1717
06:55:56,540 --> 06:56:07,209
20 minutes equals three hours that's how long it takes to make macaroni and cheese out of the box

1718
06:56:08,580 --> 06:56:16,819
is that what you eat every day three meals a day that's a side you you make others don't just

1719
06:56:16,819 --> 06:56:32,979
eat mac and cheese i hope you don't do that i went to college so did i i know that life

1720
06:56:33,619 --> 06:56:42,090
just eat it raw and don't even get me started if you make us i've got a casserole or something if

1721
06:56:42,090 --> 06:56:49,029
you're baking like a turkey in the oven or like a ham see you in an hour you guys have a slow

1722
06:56:49,029 --> 06:56:54,810
cooked before that shit takes like six to eight hours in a slow cooker am i being really told

1723
06:56:54,810 --> 06:57:05,240
that it doesn't take more than a couple hours to make food for a day an hour for a turkey this

1724
06:57:05,240 --> 06:57:13,340
takes wait it takes like three hours who bakes a turkey every week oh okay that gets me thinking

1725
06:57:13,340 --> 06:57:17,099
that gets me to think about this turn the music off this is actually fucking funny so today

1726
06:57:18,709 --> 06:57:26,119
so today i was uh i was pulling out of my i was pulling out of my spot right and i'm like pulling

1727
06:57:26,119 --> 06:57:31,479
out into the road and i noticed oh there's um just like oh and like in like the neighborhood

1728
06:57:31,479 --> 06:57:35,880
there's like there's like people outside there's like kids playing oh cool okay and like they were

1729
06:57:35,880 --> 06:57:39,560
playing uh like wiffle ball or something these they went probably six years old or something

1730
06:57:39,560 --> 06:57:44,680
right so i'm out there and i see okay everyone like watch out here comes the car everyone gets

1731
06:57:44,680 --> 06:57:49,959
out of the way and i'm like okay everyone's safe and they're the parents were out there and it was

1732
06:57:49,959 --> 06:57:56,599
just like a very quick like oh hello like neighbor kind of thing i was like hey how are you and i go

1733
06:57:56,599 --> 06:58:05,029
playing and they go yep we're playing and i go hey who's winning and they go everyone because it

1734
06:58:05,029 --> 06:58:11,450
was like 10 kids i was like oh hey who's winning and i was thinking to myself like oh i look like

1735
06:58:11,450 --> 06:58:14,569
a fucking asshole like i'm saying like who's winning the game that's what i care about

1736
06:58:17,610 --> 06:58:20,569
and then i just get they were like no everyone's winning haha and i'm like yeah

1737
06:58:21,529 --> 06:58:26,169
yeah that's great that's exactly what it should be and then i kind of was like okay bye and i'm

1738
06:58:26,169 --> 06:58:30,009
sitting the driving away going like i look like a fucking dick that only cares about winning

1739
06:58:30,009 --> 06:58:35,750
to like six-year-olds that's not what i meant though but it's like that's how i looked

1740
06:58:40,919 --> 06:58:49,259
you know i didn't slam the accelerate that's a normal thing to say i don't know i was like

1741
06:58:49,340 --> 06:58:53,740
really thinking about that that does not sound like normal when i think about it like a million

1742
06:58:53,740 --> 06:59:12,299
times in a row who's winning six-year-olds is it normal how does this relate to turkeys

1743
06:59:12,299 --> 06:59:16,020
because somebody said you're eating a turkey every week like what are you some kind of like

1744
06:59:16,020 --> 06:59:29,450
rich asshole hey who's winning turkey done yet like i bake a turkey three times a week

1745
06:59:29,450 --> 06:59:40,360
like i know i don't i don't do any of these things that's that's kind of a stretch well i

1746
06:59:40,360 --> 06:59:54,759
really wanted to tell that story uh seven hours ago what about the kids answer everyone yeah

1747
06:59:54,759 --> 07:00:00,709
that's fine you don't want like a little kid to like be losing what did you want them to do

1748
07:00:00,709 --> 07:00:09,340
be like oh yeah well uh jeffrey uh and caroline they're winning uh stacy's losing right now and

1749
07:00:09,340 --> 07:00:22,119
losing yep oh i thought i was and i was playing that would be bad all right moral the story is

1750
07:00:23,580 --> 07:00:30,200
it takes more than 20 minutes to eat three and cook and prepare and eat three to four meals a day

1751
07:00:30,200 --> 07:00:33,159
and i know some of you guys eating once a day and you're like what are you talking about it takes

1752
07:00:33,159 --> 07:00:41,540
me 10 minutes i eat one giant piece of meat don't do that anymore spread it out you should be eating

1753
07:00:41,540 --> 07:00:54,619
like three four plus meals a day snacks sometimes in the middle smaller portions you could eat the

1754
07:00:54,619 --> 07:01:04,389
same thing but just spread it out put it in the fridge it's really hard i know it's real hard

1755
07:01:04,470 --> 07:01:09,830
because i know exactly what you mean by that because when you buy the steak and cheese sub

1756
07:01:09,830 --> 07:01:14,540
you get the large and it's in front of you and you're hungry and you get through half of the

1757
07:01:14,540 --> 07:01:23,400
large and you're just like i have to eat the rest of this i have to i know that i shouldn't i just

1758
07:01:23,400 --> 07:01:29,400
just put it away and eat it later and have something else no you house the whole thing

1759
07:01:30,040 --> 07:01:38,470
it's like 1800 calories of food and then you're slow for the next four hours and then you don't

1760
07:01:38,470 --> 07:01:44,419
even you're not even hungry for dinner because you acted like a goddamn camel and you eat like

1761
07:01:44,419 --> 07:01:55,189
you ate that one large steak and cheese for breakfast and now you're not even hungry at dinner

1762
07:01:55,189 --> 07:02:07,450
over encumbered yeah i i i still do this and it's bad you shouldn't be doing it the most recent

1763
07:02:07,450 --> 07:02:11,529
science does not support that conclusion and has more than a decade intermittent fasting is the

1764
07:02:11,529 --> 07:02:21,939
healthiest thing you can do one meal a day is actually the best for you please google uh hold

1765
07:02:21,939 --> 07:02:32,250
on a second here one meal a day a huge meal is that's how you like that's how you gain a bunch

1766
07:02:32,250 --> 07:02:50,979
of weight well you're not eating like a 2000 calories and then going to bed right yes as

1767
07:02:50,979 --> 07:03:01,450
long as it's under 2000 calories what one meal a day i'm gonna look this up the one meal a day

1768
07:03:01,450 --> 07:03:10,500
diet is a weight loss plan that requires a person to only eat one meal per day is it safe to eat one

1769
07:03:10,500 --> 07:03:25,209
meal a day this is called okay this is called the oh mad diet the this is called the you mad diet

1770
07:03:25,209 --> 07:03:35,819
what the fuck is this fasting from food for 23 hours a day and eating whatever you want for one

1771
07:03:35,819 --> 07:03:43,349
meal this sounds like a scam you can just eat whatever you want as long as you eat once that

1772
07:03:43,349 --> 07:03:48,869
meal can range from a double cheeseburger and fries to a what the fuck is this is this real

1773
07:03:49,509 --> 07:04:03,220
the you mad diet i tried the extreme fasting oh mad diet here's what happened to me let's see

1774
07:04:03,220 --> 07:04:13,930
what happened you could eat pizza and burgers every day drink beer and still lose weight

1775
07:04:16,200 --> 07:04:26,259
now this is like this i've seen this commercial as long as you eat less than 2000 calories a day

1776
07:04:26,259 --> 07:04:36,490
you can eat whatever you want one but i would don't if you ate 1999 calories in one sitting

1777
07:04:36,569 --> 07:04:54,779
i feel like i would want to fucking puke i feel like i would be so full and i would it would hurt

1778
07:04:54,779 --> 07:04:59,400
what does the science say like a lot of health trends just because people do it doesn't mean

1779
07:04:59,400 --> 07:05:03,000
it's good for you the research is mixed when it comes to whether or not it's safe to eat one meal

1780
07:05:03,000 --> 07:05:09,830
a day one 2007 study connects eating once a day to an increase in blood pressure and cholesterol

1781
07:05:11,020 --> 07:05:16,459
yeah because people were told you can eat anything you want frank oh really and they eat

1782
07:05:16,459 --> 07:05:35,299
fucking four mcdoubles fasting can improve the body's resistance to diseases yeah i know like

1783
07:05:35,299 --> 07:05:47,529
fast but but well i would never be able to do that i did it for a year in college it's just

1784
07:05:47,529 --> 07:05:54,619
calorie counting for idiots people who binge on these diets typically can't maintain

1785
07:05:54,619 --> 07:05:59,020
low calories and eat shitty food if you don't binge and aren't exercising

1786
07:05:59,580 --> 07:06:09,139
you it's fine just take a multivitamin i guess that makes sense because if you eat this one

1787
07:06:09,139 --> 07:06:15,939
meal a day you just have to be like okay uh just eat once and i hope i didn't eat a whole fucking

1788
07:06:15,939 --> 07:06:33,930
pantry worth of food an entire 100 pack of pizza rolls yeah i would get too hungry i don't know if

1789
07:06:33,930 --> 07:06:40,040
fuck me up i feel like i already have like enough problems with like foods and shit i like all of

1790
07:06:40,040 --> 07:06:49,080
the intestinal bullshit if i did this i would probably like i would go into a coma you'd be

1791
07:06:49,080 --> 07:06:55,459
doing it would be like the wake up jeremy in real life what happened well he was eating once a day

1792
07:06:56,439 --> 07:07:01,080
and he was trying he was so desperately trying to get a pizza roll sponsorship so that's all he

1793
07:07:01,080 --> 07:07:06,259
ate he saw supersize me and then thought he could do that with pizza rolls and then maybe get like

1794
07:07:06,259 --> 07:07:13,610
somebody would pay him he actually he actually may have been dead for the last like four days

1795
07:07:14,250 --> 07:07:23,669
i don't know intermittent fasting would probably be good for me yeah but here's the thing about

1796
07:07:23,669 --> 07:07:31,080
fasting for me when i had my colonoscopy you can't eat solid food for three straight days

1797
07:07:32,500 --> 07:07:44,099
that was un fucking bearable that was the worst thing ever even by day one or day two

1798
07:07:48,139 --> 07:07:55,400
no i wouldn't be able to handle it i don't think i'd be able to do it and yeah you'd get used to

1799
07:07:55,400 --> 07:08:01,830
it i don't think i would my brain my brain is so misfires in every direction somebody would open

1800
07:08:01,830 --> 07:08:07,340
a jar of pickles at day one day two and i'd just be like give me those pickles and i'd just start

1801
07:08:07,340 --> 07:08:17,529
eating them and i'd be like i don't care it's over but anyways that's really interesting i

1802
07:08:18,090 --> 07:08:27,779
don't think i could ever do that but let's keep going let's do the uh this thing in fact

1803
07:08:28,500 --> 07:08:45,340
let's switch it on over oh shit do it again hey look at that thanks for all the subs guys

1804
07:08:46,060 --> 07:08:56,569
appreciate it we'll see you tomorrow only a few more bits to do what's doing we got on that

1805
07:08:56,569 --> 07:09:01,450
because somebody talked about the cookie and the milk thing right okay sad vegan thanks to the 500

1806
07:09:01,450 --> 07:09:05,849
bits i'm at a loss for words i seriously expect you to be faster and better that you are killing

1807
07:09:05,849 --> 07:09:09,930
more people this time around when they have a smarter ai you're amazing i truly mean that in a

1808
07:09:09,930 --> 07:09:18,759
good way they die quicker in this game and you have to go further distances in this game they

1809
07:09:18,840 --> 07:09:36,970
die five times faster i don't think the ai is smarter yeah they lose hp much faster

1810
07:09:38,580 --> 07:09:42,979
in the first one somebody could get grabbed and just sit there for a full probably 30 seconds

1811
07:09:46,310 --> 07:09:49,990
they die quicker here than in dead rising 2 i don't know why but off the record is weird is

1812
07:09:49,990 --> 07:10:02,299
that real you need to clear paths and strategize all right well you need you need to like get in

1813
07:10:02,299 --> 07:10:06,860
a fight with the other people that are in this chat that tell me that that's the worst idea

1814
07:10:08,490 --> 07:10:18,009
just you just say you guys should have seen this pre-stream chat it was like people fighting i've

1815
07:10:18,009 --> 07:10:36,659
never seen such division fight fight fight fight constant conflict i still think it's a lot of fun

1816
07:10:36,659 --> 07:10:57,430
no i think it's great if i wasn't having fun i wouldn't play it that simple i love it germa

1817
07:10:57,430 --> 07:11:02,310
also as a pro tip knife and mop got me through a lot of this game early on it's a deadly weapon

1818
07:11:02,310 --> 07:11:10,470
mop have you even seen a mop it's a spear it's the most combat superior weapon known to man

1819
07:11:10,470 --> 07:11:17,540
throughout history now that i agree with yeah we've talked about the spear before it's just a long

1820
07:11:17,540 --> 07:11:25,900
stick that has a knife at the end you can kill somebody before they even come near you how was

1821
07:11:25,900 --> 07:11:31,959
the spear ever fair if you knew that you were going up against spears wouldn't you also bring

1822
07:11:32,759 --> 07:11:43,400
why would you bring like a sword to a spear fight spears were the guns of like the 1200s

1823
07:11:43,400 --> 07:11:56,419
hey near shoe thanks for the five community subs don't think i saw it before

1826
07:12:16,709 --> 07:12:26,360
what it takes a real one and you might not even be here it's all i can do it's the only talent i

1827
07:12:26,360 --> 07:12:34,259
have i got on stage one time at a talent show back in high school and i did that and i remember

1828
07:12:34,259 --> 07:12:40,840
like people were cheering and then one person in the back just screamed and it ruined me they said

1829
07:12:42,459 --> 07:13:07,060
change the beat you do the same beat every time and then i got and i walked off stage hey sly

1830
07:13:07,060 --> 07:13:11,770
thanks for the 250 jerma just wanted to let you know this was the that this version of the game

1831
07:13:11,770 --> 07:13:17,459
