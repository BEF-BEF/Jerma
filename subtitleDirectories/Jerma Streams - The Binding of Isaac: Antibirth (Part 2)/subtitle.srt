1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:16,260
Hello, what's going on? How are you? Wait, somebody said, you know, it's bad if he's playing Isaac.

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,079
What does that mean? Oh man, you know, it's bad if he's playing Isaac.

3
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,420
I'll give you, we'll talk about this for just a quick second.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,340
Oh, let me, let me, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,509
There we go, I had to tweet it. I'm not even here. Just, just watch the fucking...

6
00:00:45,670 --> 00:01:37,189
I'll be, I'll be back in like a minute. So Kristen goes to the grocery store

7
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:52,170
and she buys 15 apples. She trades those apples to David for 40 bananas. Those 40 bananas are

8
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,810
then turned into a banana puree and put on top of a cake, which is then sold for $100.

9
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:25,460
What was her first name? Yeah, I got you. I got fucked over from that one like a few hours ago.

10
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,819
I got fucked over from that one. It was like, oh, how about he and times two minus that. It was

11
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:41,939
like, oh, what, what was their name? Oh fuck. It was Jen. They got you guys too. Yeah, so today

12
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,689
I'm going to play Isaac today. I did say I was going to play it yesterday.

13
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,780
I also said I wanted to play city skylines, but I'll be honest with you,

14
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:59,000
kind of hurting today. So I figured I would just sit back for a little bit and play

15
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:08,780
something that I know how to do and just chill for a little bit. So, uh, took some Advil.

16
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:16,889
Just going to hang out. Oh no, fuck it. For those of you, I'm not like sick. For those of you that

17
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:23,610
are like, wait, what are you talking about? What? Why are you taking Advil? Uh, no, it's my back and

18
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:29,129
chest and shit, but I'll be all right for a little while. I just wanted to get that out there. So

19
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,770
city skylines, is it going to be the first thing we do? And I figured let's just do a whole stream

20
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:40,330
on it rather than try to do like two hours of Isaac, three hours, and then like go through like

21
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:49,770
four hours of city skylines. I'd rather just do a full stream on it. Maybe a few of them, but

22
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,930
that's the next thing we're going to do. But I do want to stream today and I do want to play Isaac.

23
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,479
So that's what we're going to do because I can't reliably tell you how long I'm going to be able

24
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:08,099
to sit here for. I'm going to be 1000% honest. I don't think this is going to be an eight hour

25
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:17,430
stream. No, I don't, not like last time. So without further ado, did I, did I tweet this shit?

26
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:35,689
I'd be very surprised. I would be very surprised. I'll go as long as I can. I don't know. This,

27
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:42,620
this whole thing's been like flaring up like crazy. It's like the last like three weeks,

28
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,370
it's just been like, fuck, I've also been doing like physical therapy. Maybe I'm like,

29
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:56,550
I've aggravated it and it's like, just maybe, I don't know. But anyways, I'm going to do anti-birth.

30
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:05,160
I'm going to try to actually beat the fucking boss of this game. I mean, I'm going to try to

31
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:12,279
beat the actual encounter. Oh, he's aggravated. Take it easy. Don't hide. Don't worry. I'm fine.

32
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:18,810
I am fine. Why I'm telling you already this, if it gets to the point like it already happened this

33
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:29,180
week, I'll just, I'll just call it, right? And we'll try again. I'm open. So let's go. Binding of

34
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:37,800
Isaac. Ooh, I just hit you. Where am I going to put my cheat sheet over here? That fits over there.

35
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,730
Watch out for the game cube disks. There we go. All right. Web cams not on, right? No. Okay.

36
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:52,379
I don't have any fucking clothes on. He doesn't want us to worry. No, don't worry.

37
00:05:54,089 --> 00:06:00,060
Do not worry about me. Don't worry about me. Don't do it. Don't do it. Now, who do I want to play

38
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,800
with? And you guys have to help me here because seriously, I'm going to forget about the fire

39
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,459
shit. I'm going to forget about the puzzle stuff. I'm going to do Judas. What do you want me to

40
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:27,339
start with? I fucking love this game. I'm obsessed with this game. Just do random. Use mods that,

41
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:34,420
oh, this is a mod. This is Andy birth. There are other mods for Isaac. Random, random, random.

42
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:46,629
How do you do random? Oh, there it is. All right. Here we go. Actually spins a wheel. Oh,

43
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:59,430
god damn it. All right. Fucking Azazel. Really? Okay. Let's go. Do I really want to play as

44
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:09,959
Azazel right now? No. Azazel. Okay. I need, I need a warmup though. I need one warmup round.

45
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,800
Uh, this, this is not the, the, is how was it pronounced? Yeah. I need a warmup round.

46
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:25,019
Free lemonade. Yeah. Azazel is not the character you play when you warm it up. Azazel is the

47
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,420
character you play, but you're like, I fucking played like six rounds already. I'm not ready

48
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,949
to go off, like kill everything in one second. How do you pronounce it? It's a steam workshop mods.

49
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:54,740
What does this lemonade do? Azazel. Azazel. It's Azazel. Well, what did I say? Azazel.

50
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:09,509
I kind of like mine better. Don't you? Extra lemonade, whatever. All right. This is that.

51
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,589
This is, this is a delete. That's like, I got one heart. I think this is a delete scenario.

52
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:30,220
Have it your way. Did somebody just say the Burger King jingle? Hey dude, have it your way.

53
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,190
He's dying with Azazel. I'm warming up. It's a warmup round. Don't you know?

54
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:47,240
Now I gotta, there's a window here that's causing some kind of lag for some reason.

55
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,389
Don't ask me why. What's going on here? All right. My cheat sheets open in an iPad window.

56
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:04,940
All right. What else, what do I got? I'm going down here. He's already making excuses.

57
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:12,549
Yeah. That's what I, and I, I can do that. I can make excuses. I can say, nah, it's fucking

58
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:16,309
things. Fucking doesn't even work. Like I could say anything I want. I could tell you that my

59
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:22,070
control is broken. Like I could tell you that the analog of my thumb just came off when I died.

60
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,669
Like, oh, I died. Oh, fuck dude. My analog just came off and I have a dummy analog stick here and

61
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:33,480
I can put it on camera and people be like, oh fuck. I guess his analog fucking came off. That's

62
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,340
fucked up. I've never heard of that before. I don't ever trust anything anyone ever tells you,

63
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:56,759
especially me. Always, always lying. Fuck what a wash this is. Not yet. Not yet. Not a wash yet.

64
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:09,399
Okay. I'll just open it. Let's go. Ooh, good. Uh, those of you that have no idea what's going on,

65
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:16,549
this is, this is anti-birth. This is not the regular mining advisor. Do we have any tinted rocks?

66
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:23,429
I haven't, nobody's been spamming tinted rocks. I haven't seen a single

67
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:41,129
tinted rock spam. There's one back to the left because I got five bombs, two stone and one tint.

68
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:51,929
I don't think there is any. No, somebody would have been like, dude, it's in room A7. Be like,

69
00:10:51,929 --> 00:11:07,110
oh fuck, right. What the fuck does this lemonade even do? I haven't even tried to use it. It just

70
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,899
makes you pee. I'm going to try. I'm using this next room. Nevermind. Wait, lightning. Oh shit.

71
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:30,500
Fuck it. Throwers. Come on Azazel. No, that's just that. Okay. Rock. Oh fuck. Not a lie. Okay. I

72
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:39,860
gotta start listening to you guys every day. All right. This is not over yet. The next one is two

73
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:57,769
bombs, right? You should listen to us. He needs to listen to us more often. I do. You're right.

74
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:03,610
What are these? Yeah, but I'm Azazel though. Like none of the cool items do anything with Azazel.

75
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,370
That's like the super tier, right? Left, left, left, left.

76
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:23,419
Mega tiers. Does that work with Azazel? Look at how long this takes to charge. One, two, three.

77
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:32,019
Oh my god. That's a shitload of damage, but I'm not going to be able to attack anything. All right.

78
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:53,850
I gotta queue it up before I go into every room. Oh, for the love of... God damn it, man. The hard

79
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:04,470
counter. Fuck. That sucked. Do I have any hearts? Look at the damage though. It's so good.

80
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:19,509
Fuck. Oh, it's so long. It's so long. I've melt bosses. I just gotta stay alive.

81
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:34,809
Yeah, he's right. Just go with a sad face. Damn it. There's no spirit hearts in here. I thought

82
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:59,210
that was going to be... Just go. Just go. Get the pill? This is going to be like tiers down

83
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,600
and it's going to ruin the whole run. If this is tiers down, I'm going to reset.

84
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:20,100
Ooh, what's this? Talus. Your feet feels... Oh, I can walk over spikes, right? So this thing does.

85
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:32,820
Okay, let's go. All right. It's useless. Bomb the left. Going to bomb over here. That could be the

86
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:48,500
secret room. You're right. You could literally fly. Right. Right. I can literally fly. All right.

87
00:14:48,500 --> 00:15:00,580
Don't use all these bombs when I need this shit. Imagine being able to fly and buying fucking...

88
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:20,379
God damn it. I'm so dumb. All right. Beasel bub. Okay. Well, that was fun. HP up. That was... Okay.

89
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:26,649
This could work out pretty well. Get the nail. Get the nail. Get the nail? How much health do I have?

90
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:36,340
Wait, that's not the nail. That's a different nail. Yes. Get nail. Who cares? Get nail. Should

91
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:44,580
I get the nail? How many hearts do I have? If I pick this up, is it going to kill me?

92
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:51,259
You can't get the nail. Don't fall for it. Don't get the nail. Don't fall for it. What about this

93
00:15:51,259 --> 00:16:03,029
thing? Get this for more hearts. Get them both. Do it. Please. Nail. You're a coward. Mask. Definitely.

94
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:16,970
You cannot get the nail. No, you can get the nail. I'm getting this. I don't want the nail.

95
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:29,610
I don't know. It's ruined. No, the nail... No, the nail fucked up the last run. You can't get the

96
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:43,049
nail now. No, the nail fucked up the last run. I don't want it. On principle. I fucked up... No,

97
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:53,769
I didn't fuck up the last run. Didn't everyone say that I was going to get three hearts for this?

98
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:57,210
I thought, guys, you guys said if I got gimpy that it was going to give me three hearts.

99
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:06,490
It gave me one. Oh, man. Who said that? I don't know. Somebody did. I swear to God. I read it.

100
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:14,970
Like, five times. Don't worry. It's not going to get hit. Fucking hard counter. Come on. Come on,

101
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:42,420
Ed. It's not going up there again. These things are rocks. The run... No, the run's not over yet.

102
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:53,589
Not over yet. Should have got the nail. I could have... Oh, my God. Whatever. Whatever's a warmup

103
00:17:53,589 --> 00:18:05,819
anyways. Who gives a shit? Throw the fucking dice. All right. I'm okay with this. I'm okay with this.

104
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:14,299
This is Judas. Let's go. He's already malding. No, I'm not. You can't... There's no malding in

105
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:22,420
Isaac unless you die at like 48 minutes of a run at a boss. No, this is nature of the game.

106
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:34,710
Nature of the game. What is that? Rock blast. Okay. I've seen this before. Five bombs. Just a

107
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:43,349
reminder that you didn't beat Odama. No, I didn't. And I'm... Go ahead. You can tack that on my

108
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:55,799
permanent record. I don't... That's fine. I'll look at my streamer report card at the end of the year

109
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:04,119
or at the end of the semester. And yeah, okay. I'll get like fucking like a C minus in...

110
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:09,799
Didn't finish a fucking game. You didn't finish as many games as you were supposed to in 2020,

111
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:14,599
semester one. Because of what? You got an F on Odama. It just brought me down. I got like a

112
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:22,220
fucking C minus on... What was that one I just beat? Katana Zero. What was the last game that I

113
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:31,690
beat? What was the last game that I completed? What was it? Super Mario Sunshine. Okay, yeah,

114
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:46,779
that's fine. I'll take that. None. You're just talking over somebody else's gameplay.

115
00:19:47,500 --> 00:20:10,470
No, I beat a game before that. That hurts me? What? Oh no. What the fuck? My own... That trickle

116
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:16,170
comes over and hurts me. That's such a good item to get though. I have seven damage. I can't fuck

117
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:29,319
this up. Oh, I didn't even know. That's so bad. Well, let's go. The run's not over. I got full health

118
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:40,700
again. He's never played Bomberman. You know, I've played Bomberman, but played Bomberman 64. That

119
00:20:40,700 --> 00:21:03,660
was it. Stay away from me. Stay away from this fucking guy. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine. Not

120
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:14,839
even a single fucking hit. Oops. What's... What's that? Plus one to lowest stat. Oh, that's pretty

121
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:23,349
cool. At least I can move around fast. I need health. All right, let's go. Oh, beautiful. I need...

122
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:48,569
Oh my god, where do I stand? Right here. Fuck you, game. He never apologized. Sorry. I'll give you a

123
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:55,559
quick little tip on... I'll give you a quick little tip on playing games like this. Focus less on

124
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,559
where you're shooting and more just on your immediate surroundings so you don't get hit by

125
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:07,720
anything. Except for when things blend into the ground. This is a... Oh, I can't walk over here.

126
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,859
Okay, that was like... I don't even know what the fuck those things even did. Like, give me a break.

127
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:31,160
They just, like, appear next to you. That's a great tip. Yeah. And even... I was paying attention to

128
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:43,990
my immediate surroundings. Snakes were appearing next to me. Nope. No. App's a fucking loot,

129
00:22:43,990 --> 00:23:01,019
Luna. It's the worst item in the whole game. Jesus. Old R. Right, right, right, right, right.

130
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:24,920
No rewinds. Well, you're probably wondering why is he doing this? Because I know I'll fucking walk

131
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:59,299
into it accidentally. You fucking die. Oh my god. How is he not getting hit? Pog. This is, like, not

132
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:11,579
even... God damn it. Stop making me laugh. Oh, you're fucking making me laugh. That room's, like, not

133
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:17,420
even hard. It was, like... I mean, it was annoying, but, like, I could have been fine. Oh, dude, how

134
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:31,400
is he not getting hit? Pog. Oh. Good thing this is a warm-up round. This too-tinted rock. Oh, this is

135
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,559
fucking bad. Game over. Oh, that was fun. Okay, let's do it again. Maybe we'll get a good run.

136
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:55,420
All right, just blow yourself up. It's just the fifth... It's the nature of the game.

137
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:06,599
Fight it. Fight it. It's the nature of the game. Mr. Mega blast damage. Okay, that's not bad.

138
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:19,369
Oh, dude. It's like the enemies are going like this. And it's like, oh my god, holy shit. He's so good.

139
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:33,369
Pog. That's so funny. That's gonna make me laugh for the rest of the day. So, thank you for that.

140
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:43,960
Whoever the fuck you were. I didn't see the name. Take that pill. Hold on. I've got these, like,

141
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:53,319
weird enemies. I gotta fight these flies. Okay, let me give you some insight.

142
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,039
If you play games and talk at the same time, you'll know. You know what I'm talking about?

143
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:07,210
Where words don't... You can't say them while you're concentrating. Your brain has to focus

144
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,009
on the concentration aspect. And you've been on the phone... I'll give you some... You've been on

145
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:18,339
the phone talking to somebody while you're playing a game. And they're trying to talk to you, and

146
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:24,819
you just let them talk. You let them just fucking rifle off a hundred sentences. And you're just

147
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:32,809
like, yep. Yep. Uh-huh. It's like, what do you think about that? And you have no fucking idea

148
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:38,569
what the hell they were even saying. Not a clue. And you're trying to reach so desperately to

149
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:43,589
find out what you could even say to make it sound like you were even remotely paying attention.

150
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:52,650
Yeah, that's pretty... That's pretty good news. I feel like... I just got in a fucking car accident.

151
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,480
What are you talking about? No, no. I'm saying, like, it wasn't your fault. So, like,

152
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:04,440
your insurance probably won't go up. So that's like the cerebral aligning, I guess.

153
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:16,569
Best friend. What is this? Best friend. I'm going to the ice. Cheat sheet.

154
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:26,789
Okay. Best friend. I've never seen this item. I just clicked on a fucking ad. God damn it.

155
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,079
Best friend. Places a decoy on the floor which attracts enemies and explodes after a period

156
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:43,210
of time. When it explodes, there's a hundred... Okay. The fuck did I just do? No. Turn that off.

157
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:56,460
Okay. That sucks. I mean, it might be kind of good, but get an item description mod. No,

158
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,589
it's more fun to look it up because I like to be challenged to use a separate device

159
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:10,099
to go to a different website to click on a fucking ad. So, no, I like to... I like to challenge.

160
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:25,269
Hold on. I'm too lazy to do what you're saying to, like, quit the game and go to Steam Workshop

161
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:41,059
and do that for, like, the next few minutes. Just tell Siri to look it up for me. Does Siri... Does

162
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:49,319
that work? All right. Do we miss any intended rocks? No, no, no, no. There's no way that works.

163
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:59,450
Like, hey, Siri, what does the item... I kind of don't want to do that though because it's like,

164
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:12,660
hey, Siri, what does Mom's tampon do? Well, Jeremy, um, you see... All right, there's nothing

165
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:33,819
here. Blighted. All right, no more mistakes, man. Oh, he almost touched me. Thank you,

166
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:56,890
Super Milk. This is the run now. This is the one. It's me. Oh, Super Milk. It's the super frog

167
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:05,380
voice for those of you that are not paying attention. Curse of the Giant? What does that do?

168
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:20,740
What's Curse of the Giant? Bike's on the ground. Oh, fuck. Dude, what the fuck?

169
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:28,420
That was fucking ridiculous. What? That's, like, not even doable. That's not even... You can't even

170
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:35,430
beat that one. Holy shit. That one... You can't even beat that one. It's the nature of the game.

171
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:42,089
You know what I mean? It's the nature of the game. Just restart. That was good. I promise I will get

172
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:51,849
to the third floor tonight. That was insane. People just running around with a bucket. They

173
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:58,089
were going so fast. What does Curse of the Giant even do? Curse of the Get Fucked is what somebody

174
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:09,769
said. They sell big rooms, okay. That makes sense. That's insane. They were all champions.

175
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:21,400
Give me some good... Something good. Oh, don't... I'm so bad at these. I hate these fires. They

176
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:35,029
really get me every time. Mine. Okay, good. Does the sour please? Yeah, that's a pretty good song.

177
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:53,880
That's pretty good. I like it. I like the... I like this mods. Hold on. Sorry. Don't... Don't tell me

178
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,039
about anybody. Don't, like, tell me any, like, bad news right now. All right. Now I can focus.

179
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:05,769
Toxic blood. Bad. Okay. So, what was I saying? I don't even remember. I have no idea what I was

180
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:11,529
saying. I don't even remember. See, I'm on the phone with myself and I don't even remember what

181
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:18,549
I just said to me. I have like the... I have a phone upside down next to an ear and right side

182
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:40,890
up on the other one. I don't even know what I just said to myself. Yes, the gamer brain. Oh,

183
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:49,829
right. The music. Okay. So, I like... I like this mod's title screen music more than any of the

184
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:55,750
other. That's going to explode. More than any of the other Isaac expansions or musics or original

185
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:07,029
game or... I like this one the most. This is kind of a shitty start as well. I like the title

186
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:18,250
screen of this. That's objectively wrong. What the fuck? Oh, no. Not this one. The, like, hardest

187
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:25,859
first boss. Don't make excuses. I want to see somebody say, holy shit, how's he not getting hit?

188
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,720
Body blocked him. I did that on purpose. I know I have a heart over there. See? I did that on

189
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,319
fucking purpose. Damage and HP up. That's good. All right. We got hearts over here. We got a heart

190
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,640
over here. I did that on purpose. I body blocked him so he wouldn't be able to get me twice.

191
00:33:48,500 --> 00:34:01,619
If I didn't stand in that spot and get hit by that, he would have hit me twice. Speak words?

192
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:06,460
What are you talking about? I said body block. What do you think I said? Like, body wash?

193
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:20,150
What are you talking about? I'm very bad at this game and make excuses for every time I get hit by

194
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:51,300
an enemy. Oh, by the way, in case you didn't know, I wasn't even looking. I didn't understand,

195
00:34:51,300 --> 00:35:06,619
but plus two anyways. Good effort. All right. I hate these little things. I need a key.

196
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:24,059
I need bombs too. I hate them. When it turns to the meat chunks, it's the worst

197
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:35,780
because they come back. This guy had a coin, right? Or a battery. Oh yeah. Don't pick that up unless

198
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:53,340
I need it. All right. This guy's going to shoot out. Yeah. I know what you do now. I know what

199
00:35:53,340 --> 00:36:07,530
you fucking do now. Not going to trick me a third time. Rock. I'll get the rock. Don't let him come

200
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:17,900
over here. They all go in a straight line. If I would get hit. I got to get that. Okay. So

201
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,500
you guys, when I get to the point where I need to do a puzzle for the second knife piece,

202
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:32,199
you got to like, I need to see spam. I need to see like attention, attention, attention. You need

203
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:40,280
to say the word attention when there's a knife piece that I can get. You have to get my attention.

204
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:55,289
I'm not doing that. I don't have any keys. You missed a rock. I only have one bomb though and

205
00:36:55,289 --> 00:37:17,539
I need two. Hold on. Come on. Give me a key down here. Well, I, no keys. Yeah. I mean, I could go

206
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:24,920
here. Should I, should I blow up the heart guy over there or was it secret room left or right?

207
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,679
What do you think? I need two bombs. Tinted rock. I could get a key out of the tinted rock, right?

208
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:45,659
Attention, attention. Donation guy. Yeah. The rock could give, well, let's see what happens.

209
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:53,300
Let's take our chance. Well, it, yeah. Well, now what? Now I can't get the item in the second room.

210
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:08,280
Attention all Fortnite gamers. Ah, go to the sacrifice room. No, I'm going to lose all my

211
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:18,650
hearts. Let me just kill this guy and see what happens. This is a bad room to fight this guy in.

212
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:44,599
Hey, all right. Where are you? Wait, what the fuck? Holy shit. I didn't even know that was a

213
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,760
right. You want to push here. You want to push one into your lowest stat. Here you go. Hey,

214
00:38:50,760 --> 00:39:01,130
you're a lucky guy now. Oh shit. Wait a minute. That's not, how was that number? Why is that my

215
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,610
lowest stat? Isn't luck my lowest stat? All right. Now I'm going to sacrifice a bunch of hearts to

216
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:21,400
this guy. Give me some shit. Give me something. Beggar, the beggar. Yeah. This guy. No, I don't

217
00:39:21,400 --> 00:40:00,119
want the coin beggar. I want this guy. This guy's going to help me out. You can use him twice for

218
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:16,380
one. Well, I don't know. I don't know the exploit secret room, but I need a bomb. Do I take my

219
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:29,800
chances? Do I take my chances and give him like the rest of these hearts? The coin beggar. Where's

220
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,739
this coin beggar you're talking about? Is he on the other side? Is he up here? Oh, he's, oh fuck

221
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:40,300
yeah, he is. No, this is going to be all my money. All right. I'm going to get here. Take it all.

222
00:40:51,400 --> 00:41:10,230
Ray. Take care. Come on. No, not another fucking card. Do it again. Again. Fuck, is this a lighter?

223
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:28,219
You have to reset now. Just reset now. No, I can't just reset. No, it's the nature of the game, but

224
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:39,400
just anymore coins lying around. Somebody look under that couch. Any more coins? No, no, I'm not

225
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,420
holding down R. I'm not doing it. I got the world. I'm going. I'm not holding down. I'm not resetting.

226
00:41:46,420 --> 00:42:03,030
Hold R buddy. No, look, there's things I can't do. Whatever. Just I need to do like a fucking run.

227
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:35,929
I keep getting in trouble. Okay. Well, easy, easy, easy. I need a key. It's salvageable.

228
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:46,460
This is salvageable as long as key. Take a room. I need two bombs though. Whatever. You gotta make,

229
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:56,230
you gotta take chance. Okay. So I blow up the, I need two bombs for that. That's not worth it.

230
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:09,139
If I get a key, I'll be okay. It's salvageable. Where's this guy? What's left? What's left?

231
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:20,730
I got three bombs now. Go to the left room. Secret room. Key is inside of you.

232
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:44,460
Blow this up, right? Blow this up. And then I go down and let's hope it's a cool item. No,

233
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:58,329
it just skips the level. It's not a ladder. Sleep in the bed. Minus one bomb. No, no, don't tell me

234
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:09,500
to hold down R. Look, I can, I can, I open the door from here. The door's unlocked now, right?

235
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:20,630
Yeah. I can walk out and unlock it. Hey, well, look at this. I can skip. Just give me a key

236
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:30,150
and this can be salvageable. What does the fighter do? Oh, fuck these enemies. Oh, fuck you.

237
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:39,719
Got it. Bomb the beggar. I, I don't want to do that yet. I need two bombs. Remember?

238
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:54,780
I need two bombs to get the heck out of here. Okay. Set. Run saved, I think. Run saved.

239
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:02,619
Yeah. Can we, should we, should we get a translation? Yeah. You know the drill.

240
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:26,170
I don't know what either of these two things do. It hurts. No, it doesn't. Okay. I guess it

241
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:37,079
doesn't hurt. Bomb into the shop. No, I need two bombs. If I bomb into the shop, I'm going to lose

242
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:56,420
a bomb. You're playing on keyboard. I'm playing on controller. What do you mean? Eww. This is,

243
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:03,639
it's a top, it's like a top down shooter game. I'm going to play on. We won't play keyboard? No,

244
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:09,159
my fingers will hurt. That'll hurt my fingers. I've tried it before. All right. What's this shit?

245
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:15,960
Not, oh, it's a knife piece. Got it. Okay. This is now, I can't, I can't even use this because I

246
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:28,469
can't, I don't have any bombs. I know I got the knife. You don't have to do attention. I don't

247
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:36,039
have any bombs. So this is over. Well, that's fun. If I blow it, maybe if I blow up the beggar,

248
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:51,139
they'll drop a double bomb. Go into the shop. All right. I have three coins.

249
00:46:51,940 --> 00:47:03,030
Boss could give bombs. All right. We'll try that. If I skip the level, is that going to,

250
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:07,829
all right. I need some Isaac veterans here to tell me if I skip the level, will it bring me

251
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:14,019
to the anti-birth level or just go to the normal level? I don't, this is the first time I've ever

252
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:33,829
seen this boss rainmaker. Not that bad so far. Oh, that is that. Okay. Tears and shots beat up.

253
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:41,429
That's too bad because look at how good this is now. It goes to the normal level, but you have

254
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:49,559
the opportunity again on the next one. Really? Fuck. That's just more damage, but I don't think

255
00:47:49,559 --> 00:48:16,730
I have enough hearts for that. I have two. This is just a waste of time. Okay. So we're going to

256
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:40,869
bomb the beggar and see if he drops two bombs. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I, could I, could I go into

257
00:48:40,869 --> 00:49:04,969
the store? Okay. Go into the store and buy two bombs, buy key and open door. Oh my God.

258
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:16,599
God, how many keys do I need to open this? Holy shit. I think this, we, okay, we just did a math

259
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:28,889

00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,489
Hey man, I'm driving through McDonald's. I can do the Kylo Ren and McDonald's. And I'll be like,

00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:50,500
I need two spirit hearts at the end of this. This is XL. So this is it.

277
00:53:43,110 --> 00:54:14,539
It's good. I'm not touching it. Chat is mental. What? God damn it. It's all right. I didn't know

278
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:35,619
that's what that, I didn't know that's what those things did. No tinted rocks. How have there been

279
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:55,619

281
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:12,460
the rock could be in here. Got one. Oh wait. I sometimes. Hey, what's that alt saying?

282
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:40,980
Scared money. Don't make money. Oh no. No, hide. Hide. Just hide. I'm safe in here in my fucking

00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:59,349
other way. Is that it? Is it, is it over? I don't know. I can't tell. Oh shit. It's just like

285
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:07,159
Minecraft. Should I dig up? No, don't dig up ever. I'm going to dig into a bomb. I know it. Is it

286
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:16,539
going to be like going into the lava? Is it open? The door's open. It's over. Okay. Hold on. Let's

287
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:34,809
just break every rock. What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what's going on? Was it not

288
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:45,449
supposed to do that? Oh, don't do the attention thing. That's only for when I have to do the

289
00:56:45,449 --> 00:57:00,329
secrets and do the final boss. Oh, okay. Let's go. I'm not fucking around anymore. Don't break.

290
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:32,300
Yeah, but how do we know if there's any secrets? Don't put that down. What do I do? Okay. It's,

291
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:37,579
it's the, where the pebbles are. The order with the pebbles. So top. Okay. It's the pebble order.

00:57:38,219 --> 00:58:00,519
So this one first. Top right, bottom right, top left, bottom left. Got it. Knife piece number two.

293
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:09,610
And a tinted rock. Fuck you. Oh, there's a, there's a monster in there. Okay. Good. I've got it. Good.

294
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:18,739
Good. Okay. I got both pieces. The last piece is with the fire. It's got to get there.

295
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:34,010
I need a key. Okay. Let's go. You've got jumpscared by a rock through the mushroom. Oh man. I should

296
00:58:34,010 --> 00:59:02,730
have listened to you an hour ago. It's probably a tinted rock in here somewhere. No. Yup. There's

297
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:28,739
the key. Hey, what's that old saying? Hey, what's that old saying? It's in a BB unit.

298
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:37,929
No. Go back and get, get Tammy's head. I don't want Tammy's head. I want the book of Belial.

299
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:47,110
Hey, what's the old saying? You know, it's in a BB unit. Yeah, that's the one. Tammy's head is good.

300
00:59:47,110 --> 01:00:10,809
I know, but is it as good as being able to have like maximum damage? Just use Tammy's head.

301
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:18,380
You know what? Yeah. I'm going to use Tammy's head temporarily because I can use it every room.

302
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:46,980
What's with the beep? Stop beeping. Why are you guys beeping? I'm beeping. I'm beeping.

303
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:56,570
There's the key for the, uh, oh, it's the song. Okay. Any, any tinted rocks? Do you see any?

304
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:42,170
Attention. Use the head. Go to use the head. Where are I? Hey yo, tinted rocks. I don't see any.

305
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:49,980
All right. We need, there's another, um, we're going to go to the shop. It's time for the shop.

306
01:01:49,980 --> 01:02:06,099
I also need, all right. Important. I think I'm going to buy the spirit heart. I'm also going

307
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:28,679
to buy the map. Full visible map. Nice. Is it tinted rock? Okay. I need the other, uh,

308
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:43,000
I need the other room. Jesus Christ. Okay. They do that. All right. It's just a pattern.

309
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:54,920
What's the dice guy do? One of these, I think it's just money. And the other one is,

310
01:02:55,639 --> 01:03:06,409
I don't know which one of the, isn't that, isn't that like just a bunch of money?

311
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:17,909
Right, right, right, right, right, right. All stats up is right. Are you serious? Oh my God. I'm

312
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:26,309
guaranteed victory, guaranteed to win. And I'm going to beat that fucking bot. Don't forget about

313
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:37,719
this. Okay. Now I can go down. Let's. Oh yeah. Fucking idiot. This is a bug. This is looking

314
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:53,449
real good. I just can't fuck up the fire thing. Hushroom. Fire. This is good damage so far. Good,

315
01:03:54,170 --> 01:04:03,289
good tears up. Don't touch that thing. Don't even go. Don't Jeremy. Don't think about it.

316
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:28,179
We're good. Let's go. Almost just fooled me. Here we go. Wait, attention, attention. I need the,

317
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:35,619
the book, the book of Belial. That's correct. Yes. That'll go get it. Attention. Attention.

318
01:04:35,619 --> 01:04:43,940
Gamer. Where is it up here? What did I leave it? Two bosses in a row. Yep. And then we'll deposit

319
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:50,619
two hearts and we get to get to the end game. Where is this fucking thing? Oh, it's down here.

320
01:04:50,619 --> 01:05:07,139
Yeah. I'm not, I'm not going to use the book until the second boss. That's the smart play.

321
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:17,159
That's the play that gets you into the big leagues. Challenge room. I don't think so. I don't, I don't

322
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:22,150
think so. I don't think I'm going to do that. I don't think I'm going to do that. That's no,

323
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:27,559
that's a teeth room. No, I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I'm not doing it. No,

324
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:30,840
it might be good. I don't know. I don't want to do it. I'm a coward. I'm a coward.

325
01:05:31,480 --> 01:06:26,650
This guy, this is a bad place. Fight him. Clear it. Clear it. Clear it. Clear it. Bad item. Very bad

326
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:50,599
item. Just beat him through. Look at how good this is at this boss. This is, this was built,

327
01:06:50,599 --> 01:07:01,929
was made to kill this boss. What's that? Don't usually have to blow that thing up. That was a

328
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:21,849
hard counter. Was it soap? Don't pick that up. Tears and shots beat up. Oh my god. Let's go.

329
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:41,739
Let's go. Any tinder rocks? I don't see any. No, right? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Deposit. What the hell

330
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:57,860
is this again? Just take it. Don't question it. Okay. Just don't question the run. Yeah. All

331
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:02,820
right. I'm ready to go. Don't let me fuck this up. The regions after every room. Well, that's

332
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:11,659
incredible. Don't let me mess this up. When we go down here, when you, if you, I, I, I'm going to

333
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:17,340
have chat attached to the bottom of my fucking eyelids. So when I blink, I see what you're

334
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:46,470
writing. So good. Just don't ever shoot a fire. Yep. And no, and no, no Kylo Ren impressions

335
01:08:46,470 --> 01:09:16,380
for the rest of the day. Oh, my kid. Should I get this? It's better than the lighter.

336
01:09:16,380 --> 01:10:18,340
No, it makes chests red. Yeah. Where's that thing? Press forward. Press forward. Rally. Rally. Oh my

337
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:30,300
goodness. This is that's two. That's double shot. That's double shot. No. Oh, it's not.

338
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:42,699
That's X ray vision. Oh, it's still good though. It's better than the floating eyeball. Oh, I

339
01:10:42,699 --> 01:10:52,250
thought that was double shot. I was going to say this is over if it was strength. The world. Oh,

340
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:57,800
um, does that really matter? I guess I'm just, I can know where everything is.

341
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:05,560
There it is. Okay. All right. We're going to carry around strength for the boss.

342
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:13,300
We're going to go down here into the item room and yes, um, I'll take another spirit heart,

343
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:40,039
please. Okay. Here we go. What do I do? This is not, this is not it. Attention. Attention.

344
01:11:40,039 --> 01:12:25,699
Leave. Okay. Well, I'm just gonna clear shit. Attention. I need a key. Okay. 10. I can go

345
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:48,739
over here though. There's no fires in here. It's free stuff. Oh my God. Jackpot. Oh my God.

346
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:56,630
Is that item? Is this an item? Oh, okay. No, I thought it was, I thought there's a pedestal.

347
01:12:56,630 --> 01:13:33,460
I was like, Oh wow. Cool. Death. Death. That just scared the shit out of me. Yeah. Dead.

348
01:13:33,979 --> 01:14:06,140
All right. Plus one dead. Dead. Dead. Ooh. Shot speed and full health. I take every pill without

349
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:11,289
even looking at the, whatever the thing is on the label. Here we go. I'm going to go up.

350
01:14:11,289 --> 01:14:27,739
I've got to find this secret room. I have a lot of bombs and then we get the third piece. I get the

351
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:50,300
the knife go up. Okay. Uh, attention. Remember there are signs over the map that correspond to

352
01:14:50,300 --> 01:15:06,250
signs on what? On the puzzle? The presses. Attention gamer. Attention. Why did that just

353
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:27,539
happen? No, I don't want it. I'm good. I do need a key or something, right? Wait a minute.

354
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:37,939
I've got to get over there. Do the challenge. You're a coward. You have max health. Yeah, but

355
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:42,100
this is not a point for me to get cocky and do dumb things that I know I'm not capable of.

356
01:15:42,100 --> 01:16:10,329
I'm capable of it. Let's do it. Fuck yeah. Let's go. Ooh, there's a third. No, this is wicked.

357
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:32,840
Fucking easy. I don't even need that heart. Not a key though. So am I in trouble here because I

358
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:47,140
can't get over this? Buy a key from the shop. I need to buy a key. Bomb the spikes. Knife pieces

359
01:16:47,140 --> 01:17:10,500
next floor. Break the spikes. Oh, I can just shoot the rocks. Shoot the rocks. Step on them at random.

360
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:18,500
I need a key though. I'm so paranoid because I don't know what to do. Touch the button. I'm

361
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:33,020
going to buy a key. This is not a puzzle. This is nothing to do with a piece. Okay. Well,

362
01:17:33,020 --> 01:18:04,659
fucking who cares? I'll go buy a key. I don't have any. Well, I'm going to blow this up.

363
01:18:04,659 --> 01:18:19,369
Stop it. What? I want at least 15 bucks, man. I'm not throwing this run down the toilet. All

364
01:18:19,369 --> 01:18:45,579
right. Let's go do this. Okay. So we're looking for, let's open this. Alrighty. Let's go. Well,

365
01:18:45,579 --> 01:19:17,430
I got plenty of health everywhere. It surrounds me. This motherfucker just spams at you, huh?

366
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:58,340
Thank God. I just, I can just take hits. Who cares, man? Hit me. Hit me, Mr. Rock. We'll get

367
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:29,770
it on the way back. Whoa. This brain popped out of his skull. Wasn't there a, uh, wasn't there a game,

368
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:34,489
an old board game where you pulled boogers out of a person's nose until their brain popped out of

369
01:20:34,489 --> 01:20:43,689
their head? What the fuck is wrong with that? Why? What was the point of that? Yeah. There's a,

370
01:20:43,689 --> 01:20:48,329
there's a board game where you pull boogers. Gooey Louie. You pull boogers out of a guy's nose

371
01:20:49,670 --> 01:21:00,149
until his brain fucking rockets out of his skull and you kill him. I'll play it on stream. Yeah.

372
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:15,000
No, you know what? Fuck it. Okay. I'll get all the old fucking shitty board games. Play them all.

373
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:29,670
I'm talking about like slobber and Sam. Posted here. Pound it. What's this? Oh,

374
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:41,430
it walked into a fucking fire. Two of spades. I'll take some fucking free shit. What's the game

375
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:46,939
with the ice where you like, and, uh, you don't want to break the ice. I think it's just called

376
01:21:46,939 --> 01:22:05,640
don't break the ice. I think this was called. Play it on stream. I'll do them. I'll do them all.

377
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:23,579
Don't wake daddy. It's going to be a complete fuck face stream. All right. What's this, uh,

378
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:49,399
rock you guys talking about? It's rock. Elephant, the elephant. Down. I can't even hold them all.

379
01:22:50,039 --> 01:23:03,260
What was that one? Mr. Bucket. I got the balls in my mouth. Mr. Bucket. Out of my mouth,

380
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:18,439
I'll go pump. I'll get that one too. How's this? Oh, good thing I don't have very many of those.

381
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:40,699
Another one of these. I don't want that. They have mainly mouse trap, mouse trap. Okay. I will,

382
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:45,880
I will play mouse trap, but it's going to be a scenario where I don't even play the game.

383
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:50,279
I just set the trap up. This is what everybody did. I used to have that game when I was younger,

384
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:54,119
when I was a kid, but I never, I don't even know how that game works. I've never played it.

385
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,520
I just set the traps up and then just play with them and like put the mouse in it and stuff and

386
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:01,159
have the, like the Rube Goldberg machine happen. I don't even know how that game works.

387
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:08,520
I don't know. Has anybody actually even played that game once to the point where they, what is

388
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:24,819
this? Key? It feels lucky. I mean, this is kind of bad. I think keep the lighter instead. Watch the

389
01:24:24,819 --> 01:24:37,159
world burn. I actually didn't, it fucking sucks. Keep the key. Keep the key. Keep the key. I gotta

390
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:41,909
look it up on my fucking binding of Isaac. What do I do? Cheat sheet. What's it called? The key.

391
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:59,779
Key. It looks like it. Rusty. Gives Isaac a higher chance to find keys and chests.

392
01:24:59,779 --> 01:25:13,619
Yeah, that's way better. What does a lighter do? A lighter. No, not laughter. iPad. Lighter.

393
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:32,859
Chance for enemies to burn when entering a room. Am I going to need keys? Yeah, let's go do it.

394
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:42,970
I'd rather have that. The enemies burn. Look at my damage. What's wrong with my character?

395
01:25:42,970 --> 01:26:00,890
Why's my character all fucked up? Go into the curse room. Go in the curse room. Fine. It's free.

396
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:17,140
I'll take it if it's free. Did you do the puzzle? The puzzle is in the next floor. That's what I've

397
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:32,250
been screamed at. Okay. Is this a, is there a heart? There's one in the regular room.

398
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:56,420
Puzzle is the next floor. Yeah. All right. Take me back. It's time. Let's go. I'm going to save

399
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:06,199
the, I'll use the book, but you know, whatever. Who am I fighting? Siren. This is new. Probably

400
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:31,109
give her a chance. Where am I? That's weird. And that is speed and shot speed up. What do we

401
01:27:31,109 --> 01:27:39,720
got in the devil room? Don't want it. Although I guess I could just take it. It's going to be,

402
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:43,800
and it's, it's going to end up being just free because I'm going to be at infinite hearts.

403
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:59,829
I mean, it, I know it's useless. You're right. Blow up her skull. Oh no, I didn't do it.

404
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:13,770
Oh, too late. As we'll restart the whole thing. Okay. This is important. This place is huge.

405
01:28:14,409 --> 01:28:26,550
I have to be careful. Temperance. Okay. This is just a blood donation machine.

406
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:38,260
Just blow it up. Lucky toe has appeared in the basement. Okay. Money. And the love is just

407
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:44,390
hearts. So we're just going to, we're going to put these down on the ground. We'll come back

408
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:58,229
if we need them for any reason. Nice keys. I can't believe I got hit. I might as well fucking never

409
01:28:58,229 --> 01:29:29,130
stream again. Use the teleporter. I got fucking hit. I may as well eat a shoe on stream. Oh shit.

410
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:38,840
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is, uh, this is gonna, this is, this is really fucking crazy.

411
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:46,140
The bottom one, from what I remember, makes your tears fire and they can fucking explode.

412
01:29:51,430 --> 01:30:01,079
It's sad. That might be a little too risky. It hurts me too. Top one is safer. Explode and kill

413
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:15,770
you. I'm going top. Knockout. Yep. This is the... Whoa. That's cool looking. It actually flies out.

414
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:56,579
A hand flies out. What do I do? Is this it? No. Wait, what did I do that for? Oh, I can't get that.

415
01:30:56,579 --> 01:31:19,189
I can't get that. That move is so cool. There's a heart there. Ow. Oh, I walked into it. I've

416
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:37,510
walked into it. I've walked into it. It's okay. Plenty of healing. Ooh, I'll take them both.

417
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:53,829
Ooh. Answers. Vision. Do it. I have the world. Oh, okay. Well, I know I'm not going this way.

418
01:31:53,829 --> 01:32:07,449
Let's go over here. I want to go into the, uh, the shop. Oh my God. This is the shop. This is

419
01:32:07,449 --> 01:32:15,590
just the shop, but for free, but I already went in there. None of this shit is even necessary.

420
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:35,670
Just put the money back. All right. 500. Take the pill. Shot speed down. Ban every person that said

421
01:32:35,670 --> 01:33:03,109
to take that pill for at least two to three minutes, at least. Come on. Come on. Come on.

422
01:33:03,109 --> 01:33:18,359
Ah, just a net loss. Great. Thank you. Okay. The stars. That's just the shop. Go donate. No,

423
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:57,720
I might need this money. What's going on? Why didn't... Hey, it's supposed to blow it out.

424
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:09,609
Is this it? Is this it? Is this it? Is this it? I see two... I see fires in a room with no enemies.

425
01:34:09,609 --> 01:34:21,319
Don't... I'm not going to put out any fires. Do I have to put out any of these fires?

426
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:26,520
You know how it looks. Why are you asking? I, I don't know because I'm fucking nervous. I'm

427
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:47,720
stupid. Mom's pearl. Now I'll keep the pearl. That's more soul hearts. That's more soul hearts.

428
01:34:47,720 --> 01:35:22,010
Yeah. Oh my God. Okay. Good. I'm just, I'm unfucking killable. I don't lose unless I

429
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:26,810
accidentally blow out a wrong fire, which at that point I'd be very upset with myself.

430
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:35,300
Remember how this one started where it was like guaranteed. I was not going to be able to do it.

431
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:54,710
Let's punch through all three of those guys. That was insane. I wish I had more luck.

432
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:07,670
We punched that guy's brain out. Oh, I didn't even see it. Oh, I didn't even see it. All right. I

433
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:34,380
gotta be careful here. Attention gamer. There's a rock. Attention rock. Where is there a rock?

434
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:56,619
What are you guys talking about? Where is there a rock? He's lying. He's lying. He's lying. Okay.

435
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:31,029
So where is the fire room? Where is it? The big room next to the boss. Zero. So don't touch any

436
01:37:31,029 --> 01:37:40,470
fires. Don't blow out any fires no matter what. I don't care where they are. This one up here.

437
01:37:41,109 --> 01:38:32,760
You motherfucker. Okay. So where is it? All the way to the right. Oh, I gotta do this shit again.

438
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:59,880
Okay. All right. This way. No, it's probably this one up here. Um, just get it. Can I just take it?

439
01:39:02,949 --> 01:39:09,590
I can just take it. There's no fire puzzle. Just pick it up. There's no fire puzzle. Don't blow out

440
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:32,710
any fires. Just pick it up. I got it. All right. Let's go. I got the knife. Now, is there anything

441
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:39,689
special I have to do to get to the last, this last area or no? Just beat this boss and then I get to

442
01:39:39,689 --> 01:40:10,920
go through another door. That's it. Let's go. Shit. Oh my God. It's stumping. We're good. Ah,

443
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:22,539
okay. I was supposed to do that. Do I pick up anything or just go pick up the Polaroid?

444
01:40:22,539 --> 01:40:41,880
Let's go. Mom's heart. What? Wait, what? Wait a minute. Does this, is this supposed to be

445
01:40:41,880 --> 01:41:26,119
happening? Oh my God. I just took like a fucking million damage. Leave? Jesus. Okay. So here's like

446
01:41:26,119 --> 01:41:44,260
the, here's the real, the real tunnel to the, oh God. I can't leave. I'm going in. This is

447
01:41:45,739 --> 01:41:52,170
rotten heart has appeared in the basement. You're in corpse. Okay. I got to play smart

448
01:41:52,170 --> 01:42:17,130
because I need to fucking get some hearts. Nothing there. Let's get some good shit in here.

449
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:26,229
Good shit only. That's not good shit. That's not, that's not good shit either. Where am I going?

450
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:35,739
In Krampus. Of all the assholes I didn't want to see right now, I don't want to see you,

451
01:42:35,739 --> 01:43:04,819
but I'll take the coal. Back to what we were doing. Okay. Good. Very good. Poop wine tears.

452
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:42,659
I'm gonna say down. Keep your distance. Keep your distance. Just don't let them come near you. Just

453
01:43:42,659 --> 01:44:06,539
knock them the fuck up. Okay. We're good. Oh my God. It's another one. Oh, okay. Can I destroy

454
01:44:06,539 --> 01:44:28,100
those? No. Well, it's obviously not over here. You're doing so badly. I haven't gotten hit since

455
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:37,930
I came down here. What are you talking about? I haven't taken one point of damage. Um, this is

456
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:51,079
different. Let's just, how does this thing do? It's like a broken needle. It's trinket, right? Let's

457
01:44:51,079 --> 01:44:59,539
see. Let's cheat. There it is. Broken syringe gives you a random syringe effect to every room.

458
01:44:59,539 --> 01:45:20,329
Well, um, it could be bad. Too random. Too random. Too random. We're not going for, I don't know

459
01:45:20,329 --> 01:45:46,250
what that is. That's like a, uh, like a box tail. We need to work in certainties right now. I got

460
01:45:46,250 --> 01:46:01,380
a lot of money. I don't know. I'll never know what these guys do. Okay. Who's the, who's the boss?

461
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:22,229
Keep him away. This is it. Oh man. That's going to be even more, isn't it? Holy shit. Oh my God.

462
01:46:23,029 --> 01:46:27,460
Okay. I'm ready. This is un, this is impossible for me to lose, right?

463
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:34,300
I'm going in. I don't even care. I got full hearts. I got a book and I got strength. Three, two, one,

464
01:46:34,300 --> 01:47:10,699
go. And I was going to hold reset on this shit. All right. Well, there's my evil up. Okay. What

465
01:47:10,699 --> 01:47:23,079
do you got for me, devil? Nothing. It was Krampus. Let's go. Take the deal. What deal? This is it,

466
01:47:23,079 --> 01:47:30,390
right? This is the end. Orbs two. Look at those. Look at those three huge rooms down there. What

467
01:47:30,390 --> 01:48:00,039
the fuck? Holy shit was insane. You see, you know, I do, I can do the way I can do the book of

468
01:48:00,039 --> 01:48:42,140
all hell twice. Yeah. God damn it. That's what I want. There it is right in the middle. You don't

469
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:46,060
even need that, but I want it. It has nothing to do with needing anything. It has to do with wanting

470
01:48:46,060 --> 01:49:04,680
it. What am I going to spend it on at this point? It's just a thing I want. See, that's why we

471
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:24,789
collect these things. It's tier delay. It's this is like soy milk. Come on. Yeah. We want the

472
01:49:24,789 --> 01:49:52,779
cosmetic. What just happened? Oh, poop hat or riot. What do you think I'm trying to do?

473
01:49:55,260 --> 01:50:00,789
But what do you think this is? I'm very clearly trying to get the shit hat.

474
01:50:10,939 --> 01:50:14,060
Use the blood bank to get yourself to one heart to have the Polaroid be active.

475
01:50:14,619 --> 01:50:34,970
Did I do that? Did I do that? Did I do that? Like that? You have to be at half a heart. Oh,

476
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:57,140
well, I can't. If I do that again, I'll die. I'll pick up half a heart and then do it. Okay. Cool.

477
01:50:57,140 --> 01:51:09,619
What does that matter? How often is that going to activate? It doesn't matter. So why did I just do

478
01:51:09,619 --> 01:51:15,399
that? I'll get it. I'll get it. When I get hit, I'll go invincible. Every time you get hit,

479
01:51:15,399 --> 01:51:22,899
you'll be invincible. God, I love this game. Don't you just love this game? Don't you just love

480
01:51:23,939 --> 01:51:30,199
having a 20 of everything? Don't you love getting the poop hat? Is that I'm not leaving till I get

481
01:51:30,199 --> 01:51:35,829
it? Just don't accidentally touch any of that shit. All right. I'll do it here. Here, here, here.

482
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:44,180
There you go. Hey, nothing. I picked up a fucking stupid heart.

483
01:51:45,939 --> 01:52:05,380
Attention. Okay. I don't care about, I'm leaving. I'm, I don't want to do it anymore. I don't care.

484
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:10,539
Use the machine when you have a shield. No, that means I'm going to get more money

485
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:18,359
and I'll have to sit in here for like another 20 minutes. Just scam money with the shield.

486
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,920
I don't want any more money. I don't want any more money.

487
01:52:26,439 --> 01:52:37,260
All right. Okay. Scam. Don't do it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'll do it accidentally and die.

488
01:52:38,779 --> 01:52:48,539
Don't do that. Where's my poop hat? Where's the hat? This kills me. Okay. I can get a troll bomb.

489
01:52:48,539 --> 01:53:00,460
I'm leaving. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. No, bye. I'm not going to get it.

490
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:30,739
What was that? You only get one chance. Wait. You only get one chance. Or somebody just saying

491
01:53:30,739 --> 01:53:49,699
that to like save the stream. It's a hero. Oh, I don't want any more hearts. Come on. I have 10

492
01:53:49,699 --> 01:53:55,260
chances here. Hold down. I'm not going to do that because I'll walk into the fucking enemy.

493
01:53:55,899 --> 01:54:17,829
You should need to hold R to activate your shield. Five chances is it. I'm not going to even get it.

494
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:35,369
It's not even going to show up again. One more chance. That's it. Yeah. Sorry. You don't get it.

495
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:41,659
You don't get a poop hat. Sorry, guys. Don't. I don't care. I have 28 keys. Do we think I

496
01:54:41,659 --> 01:54:51,880
give a shit about this? Let's go. Wait. What's that? Why is that hard to have shit on it?

497
01:54:53,850 --> 01:55:00,460
Wait. It's blocking the door. It's blocking the door. It's blocking the door. Okay. I'm fine.

498
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:03,739
Don't pick it up. It's blocking. Can I move it? I'm going to blow a bomb up next to it.

499
01:55:03,739 --> 01:55:30,699
I'm out. I don't care. I don't care what it does. I don't want it. You owe us a poop hat.

500
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:51,369
Is that full health? This is not going to give me like health. Oh shit. No. Stop opening chests.

501
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:58,979
No more opening chests and shit. There's probably hearts in there. Give me a fucking break.

502
01:56:02,819 --> 01:56:14,260
Don't touch anything. No, I'm not. I don't care about the poop hat.

503
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:43,380
Don't want to make a new username for it. I don't care. Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

504
01:56:43,859 --> 01:58:07,109
Blocking my shot. I heard something. I heard a... Excuse me. Excuse me. Come here. Oh, a bunch of

505
01:58:07,109 --> 01:58:32,859
drugs. Okay. Should I just take this and just forget about the shield? Because I mean, you're

506
01:58:32,859 --> 01:58:39,720
talking about like three or four hits that I can't take. I'm going to carry it with me. I've got an

507
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:51,079
idea. We're going to do health up again and then I'm going to do full health if I lose these hearts.

508
01:58:51,079 --> 01:58:55,140
You know what I'm saying? If I go down to one spirit heart, I'm going to do...

509
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:00,359
Am I an idiot? Is that a bad idea? All right. I'm just going to take the health up. But what

510
01:59:00,359 --> 01:59:12,039
about the strength? You'll lose it. Holy shit. Okay. Fuck strength. Just heal and use strength.

511
01:59:12,039 --> 01:59:20,039
Full health just makes you lose health. Just take the health. Who cares? Take strength and leave.

512
01:59:20,039 --> 01:59:26,470
What do you mean take strength? I can't leave? All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right.

513
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:31,989
Take the full health, not health. Okay. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

514
01:59:31,989 --> 01:59:36,630
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.

515
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:50,310
I'm ready. Use strength now. That's not going to do anything. It's going to disappear.

516
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:54,229
Use it and take the strength. I'm going to go up my gut. I'm going to go up my gut.

517
01:59:54,229 --> 02:00:36,810
Where's all this stuff? What's that radish thing? Did I get it? What does it do? Delicious. Rotten

518
02:00:36,810 --> 02:01:07,060
tomato. I'm going to witness. And you were concerned. And you were concerned. Oh, is that

519
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:29,130
not it? Look at the little spider shank. What happened, dad? That was so easy. I killed it.

520
02:01:29,130 --> 02:01:36,569
That was so fucking bad. I was like, what should I do? I got fucking 21 damage and two tier delay.

521
02:01:37,289 --> 02:01:57,800
Pull up skull. Well, that was fun. Why is there a helicopter overhead?

522
02:01:58,949 --> 02:02:30,300
More? Use every bomb. Oh, that was cool. That build was really, really, really powerful.

523
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:53,479
Kaldama has, you unlocked Jacob and Aesop. You unlock challenge eight awakening. You unlock

524
02:02:53,479 --> 02:03:06,039
challenge nine, seeing double. What did I unlock? What the fuck? Jacob and Aesop. You play two

525
02:03:06,039 --> 02:03:24,380
people? That seems kind of cool. I'm going to see what this looks like. What? Wait, they have their

526
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:29,020
own health bars. This is some ice climber shit. I don't know if I can handle this.

527
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:54,819
They get different items each or they use the same item. It's cool. What happens if, all right, can,

528
02:03:54,819 --> 02:04:15,210
can like, can like papa get knocked off the stage? This reminds me of Lilith, but way cooler.

529
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:27,770
So if one of them dies, do they both die? This is going to be a pain in the ass. Yes. Oh God.

530
02:04:28,409 --> 02:04:40,630
Uh-oh, wait. Uh-oh. Wait, you can't, how do I make them go back together again?

531
02:04:40,630 --> 02:04:49,079
You squish them to the wall. Okay, there we go. They can get stuck. You got desynced.

532
02:04:50,039 --> 02:04:57,460
Oh, yup. This is, this, I know I see where the trickiness of this comes in. The trickiness of

533
02:04:57,460 --> 02:05:11,539
playing this, uh, Ben and Jerry, what are their names? Jacob and, and it's, what is it? Aesop?

534
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:26,359
I'll get that key. Don't worry. I'm just clearing, but they both have the effects of whatever item

535
02:05:26,359 --> 02:05:37,300
you pick up. Read the Bible. Oh, sorry. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I'm not caught up with my,

536
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:42,579
with my fucking Bible lore. I, I have to, I, I, sorry. Yeah. Let me, let me, let me read

537
02:05:42,579 --> 02:05:49,350
the Bible real quick to figure out who these two are. This, this isn't like infinity war.

538
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:53,350
You know what I mean? Like the idea that I haven't read the Bible in a very long time.

539
02:05:56,869 --> 02:06:09,100
Who ha what's going on? Who has that? Where is it? What just happened? It was used. It's used

540
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:18,550
instantly. They use pickups automatically. What the fuck? Why? Hold on. So I can't use any pickups.

541
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:43,189
Mr. I don't have anything to blow it up with. I want an item room. They auto use pickups because

542
02:06:43,189 --> 02:07:09,189
they can each have a different active item. That's bizarre. That's weird. I could see this being

543
02:07:09,189 --> 02:07:15,779
really fun though. If you get some, if you get like the Ouroboros tears, whatever the ones that

544
02:07:15,779 --> 02:07:31,369
spin around and like anti-gravity and shit, this could be really, really cool. Oh, that's unfortunate.

545
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:37,659
That's unfortunate. I mean, just use it. No, they use it automatically. I can't,

546
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:53,979
oh, this is not, they, that doesn't just fall on the ground. Oh, that's a reset right there.

547
02:07:53,979 --> 02:08:06,600
If I've ever seen one. Recept Randy. You would reset too. You would reset too if you were in my

548
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:28,170
position. Wait, is it the monk I asked question mark? Is that what we should be doing? The book

549
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:39,050
of Genesis speaks of the relationship between, I don't know, the book of Genesis, guys, I don't,

550
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:45,579
the only book of Genesis I've ever read was when, was when like fucking GameStop used to come up

551
02:08:45,579 --> 02:09:03,850
with the cheat code book for the different consoles. No, don't pick it up. Oh, oh, here comes a reaction.

552
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:43,560
It's pretty fucking good. Oh, oh, looks like we ain't going to the underworld or whatever it's

553
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:52,060
called. Don't stand over there. It was, yeah, I know I saw it. Genesis, I know you don't have

554
02:09:52,539 --> 02:10:00,949
to, we don't need, this is not like the Bible study class. Who's taking it? Yeah,

555
02:10:01,590 --> 02:10:27,399
we can have item rooms. Where the hell is the item room? Oh, gonna have to start dishing out some time

556
02:10:27,399 --> 02:10:38,680
outs here. Gonna have to start timing people out for their misbehavior. Oh, gonna have to start

557
02:10:38,680 --> 02:11:04,149
timing people out, but they're unbehaving. Wait, they both don't get it. Only one of them gets it?

558
02:11:04,149 --> 02:11:13,000
This is so confusing. Oh, so you have to, you have to plan out how, who's going to be what character.

559
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:23,319
You have to like play, oh, they get separate stats each. This is so cool. Let's see if I can get that.

560
02:11:24,779 --> 02:11:29,100
Just jack up one character. Yeah. All right. What if I just make one character insane

561
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:41,859
and just make sure the other one doesn't die? Where's that tinted rock? Give every health item

562
02:11:41,859 --> 02:11:45,539
to one person and give every damage item to another person. And then the one, but the health

563
02:11:45,539 --> 02:12:04,199
just stands in the front. Okay. This is what the, yeah, it's out of here. Fuck. One of them's almost

564
02:12:04,199 --> 02:12:14,970
dead. Who's, who's the bone in the bottom right? Red guy or green guy? Okay. Red guy can't get hit

565
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:51,300
anymore. Oh shit. Smush. It's Mario and Luigi? Oh God. Yeah. It's too confusing with.

566
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:20,149
Watch out for that fire. Stop. I can't move. If I move up or if I move down, one was going to get

567
02:13:20,149 --> 02:14:05,020
hit. God. That's okay. Ah, shit. It's okay. Watch out for super frog. Nothing. Just give me an item

568
02:14:05,020 --> 02:14:24,460
room. Damage or something. What? I can't die. I want to bring these two into greed mode. How

569
02:14:24,460 --> 02:14:42,489
come it doesn't exist? Jesus Christ. Does that mean I get more than one key? So if this one key

570
02:14:42,489 --> 02:14:45,529
does that mean it's actually two keys? Can I walk in with one of them and not the other one?

571
02:14:56,579 --> 02:15:29,319
Oh, I can't get that. Wait, I can't like stand on his shoulders? Easy. That's unfortunate.

572
02:15:30,039 --> 02:15:36,380
What's the seed? Here's the seed if you want it. I don't need to restart yet.

573
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:48,899
I'll be happy if I can kill mom's foot with this. I'll be happy. This internet itself is almost

574
02:15:48,899 --> 02:16:16,619
like a challenge mode. Hey, that was erratic. I don't tell them you need to plug in another

575
02:16:16,619 --> 02:16:56,420
controller. Oh, this is also really bad too. What? What? I can hold. Oh no. That's. I was trying to

576
02:16:56,420 --> 02:17:05,129
tell you that. Well, um, so I can just play the game with this one and just make sure this one

577
02:17:05,129 --> 02:17:32,149
doesn't get hit. Why would I do that? All right. You stay over here. I just like swallowed air

578
02:17:32,149 --> 02:17:59,420
for a second. Relax. Might as well re-roll the enemies. Whoa. That was very, very close.

579
02:17:59,420 --> 02:18:14,579
Something worth taking. It's not re-roll enemies. It's not like the wing thing, whatever it is.

580
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:53,879
Oh, bad. Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is bad. Oh, I have a wicked itchy head. Okay. There we go.

581
02:18:53,879 --> 02:19:08,020
Dude, these two guys, these two suck. It's not me. It's the, it's them, not me. Oh my God.

582
02:19:10,649 --> 02:19:18,870
Well, refill your health. All right. If it's not a really good item, I'm going to, I'm going to do,

583
02:19:18,870 --> 02:20:12,180
undo character. That doesn't break. Okay. Who's going to take it? Red guy. You take it. Uh, yeah.

584
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:21,989
All right. Red, red guy is going to, red guy is going to be the drug taker. I think. What? Red guy

585
02:20:21,989 --> 02:20:30,469
is food tester. Here, red guy, eat this. See if it's poisonous. Yeah, it is. Okay. I'll make sure

586
02:20:30,469 --> 02:20:59,399
not to eat that one. Good. What a shitty place for this. Oh, don't get hit by that. It's going to

587
02:20:59,399 --> 02:21:25,180
shoot me again. What? Look at this. Okay. Red guy. That's mine. Damage up. Not bad so far. All right.

588
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:36,020
Can I make red guy walk into the spikes? So we can, I guess I needed that health. Damn. Red guy,

589
02:21:36,020 --> 02:22:03,979
do you need health? No. Do I? No. Rock. Where is there a rock? Oh, up. I don't see it. Left and up.

590
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:46,540
Nope. Flies. Whoa. He jumped very far. Okay. What is it? Who's going to get it? Okay. It's lipstick.

591
02:22:48,309 --> 02:22:53,989
Yeah. The fucking way. Red guy. It's mine. You can have the next one. Red guy.

592
02:22:53,989 --> 02:23:26,819
They go through. Now they're going to do that. I want to do regular game. Destroyed on red wine.

593
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:46,360
Uh, it's pretty good. Remember, if there's a tinted rock, make sure you go. German. I see a tinted

594
02:23:46,440 --> 02:24:17,049
rock. I see one. I don't feel so loud. It annoys me. All right. Red guy. Okay. Good. Very good.

595
02:24:17,049 --> 02:25:23,350
Oh, he leaks. I didn't know he leaked. He leaks. God. I'm all right. I'm gonna. Oh my God. It's the

596
02:25:23,350 --> 02:26:00,809
fucking die. All right. You each get one share. I see a tinted rock. Where? Those dumb enemies. Dumb.

597
02:26:00,809 --> 02:26:29,020
We should take it. So what does this do? It spawns flies. That's pretty cool. Oh, that is pretty

598
02:26:29,020 --> 02:27:03,690
cool. It doesn't really matter. You just take it automatically. From what? What happened? I'm

599
02:27:03,690 --> 02:27:09,139
going to go from both sides. Oh, wait, wait, wait. We're going to move. Oh, I'm so stupid. I didn't

600
02:27:09,139 --> 02:27:22,309
think that through. I had to move. Okay. Hold on. You need the red guy. Go get it. I didn't think

601
02:27:22,309 --> 02:28:05,930
that's through at all. Okay. What is it? Oh, yay. He loves it. He loves it. Let's go frozen in fear.

602
02:28:06,489 --> 02:28:31,780
Hey, oh, come on. What do you have to explode? What's the point in that? What's the point in that?

603
02:28:31,780 --> 02:28:37,219
It's you just make, you're just trolling your audience. You're trolling your gaming audience.

604
02:28:37,219 --> 02:29:36,010
Okay. I died. I actually died. Wait, I have an idea. Okay. Good. Now those, those items were

605
02:29:36,010 --> 02:29:45,450
trashy anyways. You know, like what I got, I got mom's, uh, like tampon thing. Not even worth it.

606
02:29:45,450 --> 02:30:01,370
I didn't get any good items. Red guy got hit like four times. Wait, um, did they both get a familiar

607
02:30:01,370 --> 02:30:09,860
if you pick up a familiar? Oh, what was this game? Not even worth it. All right. Uh, who gets drugs?

608
02:30:11,350 --> 02:30:31,510
I, you red guy, you do it. Speed is good with these two. They both get it. Nice. So they shared

609
02:30:31,510 --> 02:30:51,979
the drugs. I know. I see it too. What was that? Oh, it was the stupid exploding bug. All right.

610
02:30:51,979 --> 02:30:59,700
You know, who's taking it? Why did it hurt me? Wait, he said, did he took the drugs and then

611
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:30,739
slap me in the face? Well, this is going to be a pain in the ass, huh? Restart.

612
02:31:35,579 --> 02:31:59,100
No, not until I, not until I fight the boss. Oh, we're dead. We're like so thick together.

613
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:36,180
Oh, okay. We're good. Dog food. Red guy. I don't have any keys. So we have to go down.

614
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:43,049
No keys. The German hates restarting. Well, not okay. If I don't get any keys, I want to

615
02:32:43,049 --> 02:32:47,430
play as a different character, but the random, you have to go with the random. You got to roll with

616
02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:56,569
and that's the nature of the game. I want to make these two work, but I might not be able to.

617
02:33:08,549 --> 02:33:22,389
Red guys piss. Excuse me. All right. More drugs. Shot speed down. Can I run faster than the shots?

618
02:33:22,389 --> 02:33:52,010
Are you serious? That's so stupid. Bomb, bomb, bomb. It's a bomb. It's not a bomb. Split up.

619
02:34:01,989 --> 02:34:25,030
No. All right. It's not, it's not bad. It's not bad. We just need a key. I got a leap on you.

620
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:45,030
Grandma, I see a rock. I see a tinted rock. You do? No, you don't. You don't see them. What are

621
02:34:45,030 --> 02:35:23,540
you talking about? See how thick they are? No keys either. Right there. Oh my God. Horrible room.

622
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:34,280
Who gets the jawbreaker? Why is there not a third, why is there not a third Ed brother?

623
02:35:37,700 --> 02:35:50,680
I get it. I need health. Is there any hearts lying down on the ground somewhere?

624
02:35:50,680 --> 02:36:05,620
There's not. This is bad. This is, might be a reset. This might be a restart. It depends

625
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:31,030
on what happens here. Holy shit. I was, did I eat it? Okay. Hog food again. Well, we may as well

626
02:36:31,030 --> 02:36:37,510
just have them both be the same, but there's a devil deal. Okay. Holy shit. All right. One,

627
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:43,209
if you take the kit. All right. One, if you take the collar, why don't you take the tail?

628
02:36:43,209 --> 02:36:57,620
Hold on. Will he die? He'll die. All right. So what if you take the collar and the tail and then I

629
02:36:57,620 --> 02:37:33,000
make sure you stay alive. Okay. Red guy. What are you ruined? Why? Times one. Was that joke funny?

630
02:37:33,639 --> 02:38:06,649
I don't know. Still can't get in the item room. That sucks. Oh, dude. Drinking game. Drink every

631
02:38:06,649 --> 02:38:15,979
time Drew says, this is bad. Sit. This is bad. Oh, no, this is bad. Oh, it's bad. You're drinking

632
02:38:15,979 --> 02:38:20,790
fucking water though. No, not anything else. So there's a water drinking game. You take a shot

633
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:35,079
of water. This is church. You know what I mean? Like, oh, we're taking shots of water. You don't

634
02:38:35,079 --> 02:39:01,909
have to drink that alcohol. No, we don't. No, no, no, no, no. Place. Come on. Big place. Big place.

635
02:39:17,299 --> 02:39:27,020
Run over. Oh, are you sure about that? Run over, huh? Run over. Run over. Red guy. Get it. Look,

636
02:39:27,020 --> 02:39:48,520
I'm playing every Resident Evil game that had co-op after 2008. Oh my fucking God.

637
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:55,079
That hurt my whole body. That actually did hurt. It sucks. Fuck.

638
02:40:11,899 --> 02:40:16,440
So does it matter who picks this shit up? I guess you got that one.

639
02:40:22,040 --> 02:41:07,530
Isaac won. Okay. I'll allow it. I'll allow it. Pretty good. Pretty good. Nice work. Okay. So after

640
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:42,780
we completely fucked that whole thing up. Opening. I see an opening. I see an opening. This guy's

641
02:41:42,780 --> 02:41:49,770
fucking insane at this game. Imagine like you just came in right now and you're like, imagine like

642
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:52,090
you like it and you like it and you like it. How many times are you going to say fucking like

643
02:41:52,090 --> 02:41:57,129
and the same fucking like? Like, set and select fucking like. Imagine like you. Imagine you come

644
02:41:57,129 --> 02:42:39,930
in right now. Speed up. I don't want speed up. It's kind of sucks with these two because they

645
02:42:39,930 --> 02:42:53,450
run into walls. Jerma, I see it. Tinted rock. It doesn't matter who gets it. I need keys. Have

646
02:42:53,450 --> 02:43:08,420
I found one key in the whole time in like three floors? Oh, there's one. Whoa. That was close.

647
02:43:09,299 --> 02:43:36,819
Blow up. Blow up. Blow up. Key. Okay. Now I need. Should I open a? Hey, scared money don't make money.

648
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:56,760
Back to Bob's brain. Bob's brain percent. It's over. Okay. Like if you could hit go,

649
02:43:56,760 --> 02:44:05,340
if you could make a bet right now and you had like, let's say it was 500 to one odds

650
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:11,860
that I wasn't going to die in the next one floor. Would you take those odds now that I have Bob's

651
02:44:11,860 --> 02:44:16,649
brain and one heart? Like, would you take that? Would you do that? Would you be like, you know

652
02:44:16,649 --> 02:44:20,889
what? I think he, you know, it's a huge fucking chance, but I think he might be able to do this.

653
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:43,110
Would you put like 10 bucks on that? What happened? Oh, wait, why? Where's Bob's brain?

654
02:44:43,110 --> 02:44:48,420
Where's the? Oh, there it is. Okay. I got a little concerned there for a second.

655
02:44:48,979 --> 02:45:04,329
Hold on a second. Just have red guy die every time and I, I'll never lose. Just have him get

656
02:45:04,329 --> 02:45:24,489
killed every time. That's going to kill me. I might as well like just, just play as a different

657
02:45:24,489 --> 02:45:33,819
character at this point. There's no way I'm going to live. These two are cool, but they really are

658
02:45:33,819 --> 02:45:54,459
very difficult to play. Oh yeah. I was going to do a Bethany run. Wasn't I? I'm going to try. Oh

659
02:45:54,459 --> 02:46:26,389
my God. Everything. Watch out for that fucking brain. It's okay. I'm never going to just go in

660
02:46:26,389 --> 02:47:02,379
a different room. Just go in a different room. Oh great. Super wrath. I get this too, with these

661
02:47:02,379 --> 02:47:08,780
two, it's too hard. I'm too concerned about Bob's brain now and I got to move them both around.

662
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:34,760
They're both super thick. It's triple the hit Bob. Did I even know the item room yet? No,

663
02:47:34,760 --> 02:48:12,819
I don't have the fucking key. Jump Bob. What's still life? Okay. We can continue.

664
02:48:31,350 --> 02:48:47,579
Sorry, I can never lose. I can play as many times as I want. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Don't

665
02:48:47,579 --> 02:48:57,000
leave me. Oh my God. I almost just killed him with Bob's brain. Back up, back up together.

666
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:26,979
All right, we're good. No key. This is like the kid that's rented out the arcade and gets as

667
02:49:26,979 --> 02:49:37,190
many coins as he wants. Oh, versus Chad. I could see that. The thing I got Bob's big ass brain.

668
02:49:37,190 --> 02:50:11,000
Dude, I could. No, just do the regular game. Do you think I have no chance? Do it. Do it. Item

669
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:18,840
room. I can't get into the item room. You're immortal. Literally immortal. Yeah, I'm immortal,

670
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:26,629
but I can die over and over again. I still have to not get hit. Secret room. Where's the secret room

671
02:50:26,629 --> 02:50:43,879
up here? This is training right here, right? Well, let's just cover all of our bases. It's

672
02:50:43,879 --> 02:50:59,000
like one of these slots right here. No, what the fuck? No, what the fuck? Line up with the door.

673
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:28,870
What are you guys talking about? No, you can't use brain. Yeah, but I just get to time travel.

674
02:51:28,870 --> 02:51:35,799
I get to just go back in time. I get hit once and I die, but I can do it infinite amount of times.

675
02:51:36,760 --> 02:52:04,659
All right. Who thinks has better luck at the casino? Red guy or other guy? Oh my God. I just

676
02:52:04,659 --> 02:52:37,399
panicked through Bob's brain. We need hearts. No. I can't. Just blow it all up. Fire the brain. Fire

677
02:52:37,399 --> 02:53:09,020
the brain. Fire the brain. Retreat. Retreat. Retreat. What is this one? I just unlocked it.

678
02:53:09,020 --> 02:53:35,559
Isaac's. You get a sword. Wait a minute. Is it an actual melee weapon? Dude, you can. I'm going to

679
02:53:35,559 --> 02:53:49,750
be real good at this. I think I found the thing that I can do very well. I'm going to kill every

680
02:53:49,750 --> 02:54:11,750
boss in less than a second. How much damage does it do? Do I, does it get damage up? Why can I find

681
02:54:11,750 --> 02:54:38,629
this out in the wild? God damn it. Let's go. Guga flies. Oh, that's, that's really interesting.

682
02:54:38,629 --> 02:54:49,750
Really cool. Like a character you are. Um, let me introduce you to a fucking 39.2 mouse clicks a

683
02:54:49,750 --> 02:55:10,010
second. What's this? Still hit. That's fine. If I take one heart, I'll spam and kill them instantly.

684
02:55:10,010 --> 02:55:22,620
Yeah, I don't want to do that. I'm going to item room. I can pick the rocks up. Yeah, that's yep.

685
02:55:27,239 --> 02:55:35,500
There is no item room in these challenges. Is there? No, there's no item room in challenges.

686
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:53,700
Coins. Fuck. You have the bracelet of strength. Re. Pick up coins. What the fuck?

687
02:55:55,059 --> 02:56:00,500
I'm going to get them. Wait, where? Why did that just not show up on my fucking mini map?

688
02:56:01,139 --> 02:56:50,489
You have the bracelet of, yeah. Okay, let's go. Slow down, MonkaS please. Does the shield block

689
02:56:50,489 --> 02:57:06,469
all projectiles or is only some? This is a really cool item though. Is this added in

690
02:57:06,549 --> 02:57:18,600
anti-birth or is this an item that's in the base game? It's from anti-birth. Oh,

691
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:45,450
okay. Got a big arc too. Um, let's, let's just go, um, hold on. Uh, let's go kill this boss instantly.

692
02:57:45,450 --> 02:58:04,420
HP up. Not like it matters, but I could maybe try and find a key.

693
02:58:12,940 --> 02:58:30,969
Beep. There we go. Finally. No rocks. What about this? Gonna pick a throw bucket.

694
02:58:30,969 --> 02:58:38,309
Ooh, I have money in it. That's cool. So all of them have money in them. Um, I just got a fucking

695
02:58:38,309 --> 02:58:59,860
item. Blood sucker. That's a little leechy. All right. Item room or just pray. Thank you.

696
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:19,340
And I have enough for an item in the item room. Look at that. Perfect. Too bad. Too bad. Wait,

697
02:59:19,340 --> 02:59:28,489
what? Hold on. I can, I can hold it out. It's a lance. Deck of cards is good. Yeah,

698
02:59:28,489 --> 02:59:45,020
but I have rock throw. Replace it. I mean, it won't replace it. This is a, oh, it's a passive.

699
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:54,489
I thought that was the, and there's the sun card. Okay. Well, I thought that was the one

700
02:59:54,489 --> 03:00:08,040
that was the active that you had to activate. Let's keep going. It doesn't get the reference.

701
03:00:09,430 --> 03:00:22,120
He hates Zelda. I don't, I don't play Zelda. I don't play Zelda. I play FPS games. I need money

702
03:00:22,120 --> 03:00:29,159
for this. How do I cycle between the cards? Right? There we go. Yeah. I need money before I summon

703
03:00:29,159 --> 03:00:48,040
him. Throw them, throw them all. The buckets seem to give you good shit. This game is literally

704
03:00:48,040 --> 03:00:55,299
Zelda. It's not. It is literally star tropics. Sorry. It's not Zelda. It's star tropics.

705
03:00:56,100 --> 03:01:26,059
It was inspired by Zelda. It was inspired by star tropics. Hard counter countered. This is really

706
03:01:26,059 --> 03:01:50,229
fun. Get Ed on the line. It was inspired by star tropics. How are we doing? It was inspired by

707
03:01:50,229 --> 03:01:57,979
the Bible. Wait, do I need to collect these? Why do I need these knife pieces? Why do I need these

708
03:01:57,979 --> 03:02:13,750
knife piece of shit? Why do I need this knife piece of shit? I can't even use it. Do I have to get

709
03:02:13,750 --> 03:02:34,149
the knife? This is a challenge. I can't believe that fucking hit me. Wasn't everything inspired

710
03:02:34,149 --> 03:02:45,100
by the Bible? Fuck it. Thanks. Everything was inspired by the Bible. There's no bucket down

711
03:02:45,100 --> 03:02:54,059
here. A lie. The Bible was inspired by the Bible. They made another one. They wrote like three of

712
03:02:54,059 --> 03:03:12,739
them. Yeah, there's like the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Third Testament. I'm not

713
03:03:12,739 --> 03:03:51,139
opening that door. Let's go. Oh, fuck. He's doing another move. Fuck you, man. Nice. HB up, tiers up,

714
03:03:51,139 --> 03:04:10,809
shot speed down. Okay, so let's go. You're a walking cheese grater. Wood chipper. Laugh and

715
03:04:10,809 --> 03:04:27,850
Jerma laughs with you. It worked. Have you ever considered that The Binding of Isaac was inspired

716
03:04:27,850 --> 03:05:06,600
by Zelda? It was inspired by Star Tropic. Fool. All right, look for, uh, yep. March it, Spider Rock.

717
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:32,950
The Bible. Play it safe here. Just fire at them. You know what? I can't even get over there. There

718
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:40,620
we go. Stupid. Poked your head up. Coin on the table. There's a coin on the table. Jerma, coin

719
03:05:40,620 --> 03:05:45,180
on table. Someone else will pick it up. I leave stuff behind sometimes so other people can like

720
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:59,860
have some fun and collect coins. I keep thinking this little leech guy is a bad guy. It should give

721
03:05:59,860 --> 03:06:13,590
him like a big blue outline so I know. This game looks and plays nothing like Star Tropic. Um,

722
03:06:13,590 --> 03:06:26,459
that's spoken like somebody that's never played one second of Star Tropic. Have you? I beat Star

723
03:06:26,459 --> 03:06:48,600
Tropic when I was 11. I think I should know. Look at how much better I am with this melee involved.

724
03:06:48,600 --> 03:07:01,829
Streaming. Star Tropic is grid based. This is not good. Okay, guys. I think it's time to

725
03:07:02,549 --> 03:07:08,329
put this to rest for you once and for all. I think it's time to put this shit to rest.

726
03:07:09,930 --> 03:08:22,969
Once and for all. Sorry. What, what are we watching right now? What's this? What? That little

727
03:08:22,969 --> 03:08:31,959
fucking little maggots on the ground? This is, uh, Zelda. Zelda came before this. Oh, yeah.

728
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:39,079
No, it's inspired by Star Tropic. And by the way, the song is fucking, this song is an absolute

729
03:08:39,079 --> 03:08:58,870
banger. Uh, uh, Mike, Mike Jones. I think this, that's the main character's name is Mike Jones,

730
03:08:58,870 --> 03:09:03,430
right? He's going to be in the Smash Brothers DLC pack number two. He'll be the fifth person.

731
03:09:11,610 --> 03:09:21,860
Now put on Zelda. When it starts, Zelda NES. I've never played Zelda. All right, let's put on

732
03:09:21,860 --> 03:09:50,569
Zelda NES. Okay. This looks like a fucking wildly different game to me. What's going on here? What's

733
03:09:50,569 --> 03:10:00,010
going on here? I don't want to play your fucking MMO. Get a move. Let's go. Oh my God. I don't

734
03:10:00,010 --> 03:10:24,069
want to play Roblox. Oh, look at this. Just like Isaac, huh? Inspired by fucking Star Tropics.

735
03:10:24,069 --> 03:10:33,780
By the way, Star Tropics came out December 1st, 1990. When the fuck did Zelda come out? 1993?

736
03:10:33,780 --> 03:10:47,819
Yeah, I knew it. Zelda. Legend of Zelda. NES came out on, uh, February 21st, 1996. So sorry,

737
03:10:47,819 --> 03:11:16,340
guys. That's not who copied who. Star Tropics. Fucking sick. You guys only played it. You would

738
03:11:16,340 --> 03:11:29,219
know that it's inspired by, it's inspired the binding of Isaac. Wait, there were games before

739
03:11:29,219 --> 03:11:42,520
Fortnite. Ow. I blocked projectiles. Why am I not using this? How am I not? I have so many keys.

740
03:11:42,520 --> 03:12:10,899
Just go in. Isaac was inspired by GTA 3. I thought you could drive a car in this game. Oh, too bad.

741
03:12:10,899 --> 03:12:30,809
Fucking relax. What the hell am I doing? Oh yeah. I'm done. I can't block those? Oh, that's not good.

742
03:12:31,770 --> 03:12:41,739
See? I told you I could pick up the TNT. I can't. I can't pick up TNT. Fuck. I'm, I'm done. I'm done

743
03:12:41,739 --> 03:13:02,120
for. I can't just use the only thing I'm good at, which is pressing a button very fast. Block every

744
03:13:02,120 --> 03:13:23,510
shield. Oh, this sucks. Oh, fuck. This is bad. I can't get over there. Like, that thing's gotta...

745
03:13:34,090 --> 03:13:53,829
Oh! I didn't block it. Fuck. All right. What? What? What? What? What? What? I made McMillan's

746
03:13:53,829 --> 03:14:12,739
that. What are you? What? What? Let's copy Zelda and Meat Boy to copy Mario. Just make it

747
03:14:12,739 --> 03:14:23,459
your own and be true. I know. Fucking Zelda is one of the inspirations. One of the many inspirations

748
03:14:24,420 --> 03:14:43,959
of Binding of Isaac. Bomb this guy? Does it work? Doesn't work. It's one of the many inspirations

749
03:14:43,959 --> 03:14:54,819
of Binding of Isaac. Star Tropic is one of them. You never mentioned Star Tropic once

750
03:14:54,819 --> 03:15:30,709
ever in any interviews. Oh, come on. Are you sure? Okay. If you type, if you type it, this is where

751
03:15:30,709 --> 03:15:39,780
it gets sad. When you type in Binding of Isaac Star Tropic, there are only four pages of results.

752
03:15:39,780 --> 03:15:48,840
And when you get to page three or page two, you get, you're going back to like 2008 of,

753
03:15:50,680 --> 03:16:05,079
that's almost impossible that there's three pages on Google. Look, I never said that it was the

754
03:16:05,079 --> 03:16:11,879
direct inspiration for Isaac. I said it was one of the many factors in a long line of clearing

755
03:16:11,879 --> 03:16:16,920
enemies in a room and then the door opens and using keys to go in those rooms. A long line of those

756
03:16:16,920 --> 03:16:32,309
games is what I said. Binding of Isaac is directly inspired by Zelda, Star Tropic and viewers like

757
03:16:32,309 --> 03:16:56,649
you. Coming up next is Arthur, episode 380. He gaslit himself. This is what happened.

758
03:17:02,170 --> 03:17:11,159
There's a hot, there's a hot backpedal. What? I don't know. You play Star Tropic?

759
03:17:12,899 --> 03:17:21,819
You'll see. There's items, an item shop in Star Tropic. There's little maggot enemies that go

760
03:17:23,579 --> 03:17:56,649
when they fly over. Look, I know. I've played it. Fuck the technique. Yeah, well, thank you.

761
03:17:56,649 --> 03:18:24,100
Give you some hearts. You know, not yet. Zelda had hearts. You bet they laugh. Yes, Star Tropic

762
03:18:24,100 --> 03:18:28,920
had hearts too. Dermot, if you say the word Star Tropics again, I'm going to lose my mind.

763
03:18:33,139 --> 03:18:45,530
Said like, okay, this is ridiculous. Unbelievable. That's unfucking believable. All right. Bite

764
03:18:45,530 --> 03:19:09,979
them. Eat this guy. Eat them. Eat them. Eat them. Eat them. You're not eating them fast enough.

765
03:19:19,739 --> 03:19:33,610
Eat everybody. Star Tropics had religious imagery and, well, Star Tropics was aliens.

766
03:19:34,170 --> 03:19:51,100
So, I mean, they're fucking aliens in Zelda. Aliens in the Bible.

767
03:19:52,299 --> 03:20:04,809
And then that is when, that is when Peter spoke upon the large alien creature when they landed in

768
03:20:04,809 --> 03:20:30,709
their spaceship. Peter could be heard saying, look at this. You laughed at that. Don't even,

769
03:20:30,709 --> 03:20:38,040
don't even start with me. You laughed at that. I know a couple of you didn't and you feel like

770
03:20:38,040 --> 03:20:48,090
the fucked up. I didn't laugh at that shitty joke, but it's okay because I know for a fact

771
03:20:48,090 --> 03:21:00,629
that at least a hundred thousand of you did. Okay. Can you, don't ever go against technique.

772
03:21:11,100 --> 03:21:16,120
Any tinder rocks? Anybody see any? There's 5,000 people there. What do you mean?

773
03:21:16,760 --> 03:21:39,139
What did I say? Jawbreaker. I see a tinted rock. Do you? Are you making that up or do you really

774
03:21:39,139 --> 03:22:12,170
see one? I don't see one. Oh no. He lost 95,000 viewers. That would be bad. This sucks. This

775
03:22:12,170 --> 03:22:19,209
sucks. All right. Eat them. Look, it's my guy versus your guy. You're a lot bigger and stronger,

776
03:22:19,209 --> 03:22:48,680
but mine has more perseverance. Get him. He is doing the rat emo. Good work. A lot of you guys

777
03:22:48,680 --> 03:23:17,479
over here. All right. You finished the job. Aha. That's two for two. I don't see a tinted rock,

778
03:23:17,479 --> 03:23:36,149
but that's thanks for the input. Full health. I think I'm going to do this shit. I think we're

779
03:23:36,149 --> 03:23:50,389
going to fucking be able to do this. All right, so bite him. Kill that one. Okay. I'll take out

780
03:23:50,389 --> 03:24:07,219
this one. You get this one. Get him. Get him. Get him. Nice. Um, up there at top right. Okay. No

781
03:24:07,219 --> 03:24:17,379
tinted rocks. Name the leech. Um, okay. I'll name the leech. How about, um, I think it's something

782
03:24:17,379 --> 03:24:29,399
that I would be able to remember. Something I can remember. Uh, oh, here's something I could

783
03:24:29,399 --> 03:24:33,719
always remember. Star tropics is a better game than Zelda. That could be that. That could be

784
03:24:33,719 --> 03:25:03,340
his name. Easy to remember. He's never played Zelda. Watch out. What do I do? Oh, I don't know.

785
03:25:03,340 --> 03:25:19,079
Maybe I can't get over there. Oh no. No. Oh, it's okay. I was going to say he's not my friend

786
03:25:19,079 --> 03:26:09,110
anymore. Oh my God. There's a teleporter. What? Blow it up, right? Blow up the head. Wow. You know

787
03:26:09,110 --> 03:26:20,569
what the, you know what the Zelda game was? I'm being honest. I mean, Ocarina of Time's great.

788
03:26:20,569 --> 03:26:43,639
Um, I still play Breath of the Wild, but keep up the pressure. Keep the pressure up. Don't even

789
03:26:43,639 --> 03:26:55,829
let him attack. Just keep the pressure up. Casino. Stream Breath of the Wild, please.

790
03:26:56,389 --> 03:27:16,069
I would probably really like it. Another dumb card that nobody wants. Um, speed up. I'll take it.

791
03:27:20,010 --> 03:27:27,459
All right. Here we go. Give me some stuff. No, I want to blow these up and I don't even want

792
03:27:27,459 --> 03:27:42,819
to do anything. Oh, come on. I want money from these. It's like the game can't even hear me.

793
03:27:42,819 --> 03:28:10,389
You can't hear. Hello. Can you hear me talk? I'm going for it. Come on. Oh, he stepped on his head.

794
03:28:11,350 --> 03:28:30,229
Fuck. Okay. She knew. I can come back with more money. Why can I pick up these rocks?

795
03:28:30,229 --> 03:28:46,709
Pick it up, man. Pick up the rock. Where's my face cam? Sometimes I don't have my face cam on

796
03:28:46,709 --> 03:28:52,260
because I don't want to be on face cam. Sometimes I'm camera shy and I don't want to be on cam.

797
03:28:53,139 --> 03:29:02,790
All right. Finish the job. And yes, I don't have any clothes on. People think that's a joke. They

798
03:29:02,790 --> 03:29:06,790
really do. And that's fine. It's actually probably better that way that you think that that is just

799
03:29:06,790 --> 03:29:13,620
me messing around. But I am sitting here right now. I don't have a shirt on and I'm in pajama

800
03:29:13,620 --> 03:29:24,819
pants. And you'll never know if that's true. No. You know what? No, fuck it. I'm wearing a suit.

801
03:29:25,379 --> 03:29:48,860
I'm in a tuxedo right now. Do I need to do this? Wait. Fires. All right. Fires, right? Holy shit.

802
03:29:49,500 --> 03:30:13,930
No. Who's this going to take me? Oh, interesting. Interesting. That's interesting.

803
03:30:13,930 --> 03:30:31,350
Oh, what the fuck? Why? What the fuck? Oh, they shoot. I forgot the purple ones shoot too. It's

804
03:30:31,350 --> 03:30:44,329
just a net zero. Wink. I don't do winks anymore. I'm not that guy. I don't do that anymore.

805
03:30:44,889 --> 03:31:06,739
You gotta be fucking kidding me. One more for the road. No. Is there a reason why I cannot pick up

806
03:31:06,739 --> 03:31:24,170
rocks anymore with this gauntlet? I can't pick up rocks. They're special rocks. I'm not talking to

807
03:31:24,170 --> 03:31:45,430
you until you wink. Are they going to keep splitting? I'm going to just come on. Do I

808
03:31:45,430 --> 03:32:04,760
actually have to do this? Oh, guess. Good thing I got the bomb back. Oh my god. Oh my god. Omega.

809
03:32:04,760 --> 03:32:17,209

810
03:32:17,209 --> 03:32:27,129

811
03:32:27,129 --> 03:32:35,879
me. Now I'm being silent. Dude, I don't want you to... Hold on. Two hearts. Two spades. Just take it.

812

1084
04:56:25,080 --> 04:56:43,959
purist is fun um it isn't yours but you you don't get any items at all yeah that's so difficult

1085
04:56:44,979 --> 04:56:50,060
it's just i i got no intention of doing that boiled baby

1086
04:56:52,979 --> 04:57:23,619
just takes forever to kill bosses two of clubs all right so no items huh

1087
04:57:24,259 --> 04:57:31,319
oh there's another secret pocket that i could kill them up before they touch me

1088
04:57:32,119 --> 04:57:36,790
i need my memory when he said it was going to be a maximum four hours isaac's stream

1089
04:57:39,619 --> 04:57:46,299
that's true i did say that but also remember um if you weren't here earlier this stream is

1090
04:57:46,299 --> 04:57:54,419
probably not going to be very much longer i'm trying to take it easy i've had some annoying

1091
04:57:54,419 --> 04:58:04,090
pain because you've uh those of you that know the yeah yada yada yada uh i was kind of hurting the

1092
04:58:04,090 --> 04:58:09,770
other day and i'm kind of hurting now but i took some advil and i'm like okay now but

1093
04:58:10,729 --> 04:58:19,340
this is like i can't sit here i can't do like an eight hour session here it really is the worst

1094
04:58:19,340 --> 04:58:26,790
because like like sitting down actually does make it worse after like five plus hours what i'll

1095
04:58:26,790 --> 04:58:35,540
probably have to end up doing is i'm probably gonna get a standing desk and see if it helps

1096
04:58:45,770 --> 04:58:57,270
so it's on it's on the table tape yourself to the ceiling what because i have noticed that

1097
04:58:59,349 --> 04:59:06,169
lying down is all right like i'll wake up in the morning and i'm kind of stiff but and like moving

1098
04:59:06,169 --> 04:59:09,930
around if i'm like walking around and moving around you i'm like usually i'm like okay

1099
04:59:11,049 --> 04:59:16,389
it's not as bad as it is we're just seated something about the seated position even with

1100
04:59:16,389 --> 04:59:21,029
like good posture and with a brace on something about it i don't know it's like somehow it's

1101
04:59:21,029 --> 04:59:28,630
compressing my spine and rib cage and um making my issue already it's there worse

1102
04:59:29,509 --> 04:59:37,669
oh there's a credit card good thing you just used it for no reason oh that's good luck up

1103
04:59:38,470 --> 04:59:52,139
get a hanging from get a hanging roller coaster chair that would actually be pretty cool

1104
04:59:53,020 --> 05:00:04,939
well we're gonna fill this room with shit i thought there were no item rooms

1105
05:00:06,389 --> 05:00:14,729
in the challenges wait what how is there item room in here get a lumbar roller i have one already

1106
05:00:17,159 --> 05:00:25,159
i'm doing physical therapy i have trust me if there's a device to help with like

1107
05:00:25,159 --> 05:00:32,040
potential costochondritis like arthritis i've i've probably used it or tried it

1108
05:00:35,349 --> 05:00:49,770
i've tried it some of them help some of them make it worse is that a tinted rock fuck it's not

1109
05:00:50,490 --> 05:01:10,680
but well marijuana is true uh although here's the issue okay i'm gonna give you guys the real

1110
05:01:10,680 --> 05:01:18,419
the we're gonna get real talk time okay so um of course like something like marijuana i mean it's

1111
05:01:18,419 --> 05:01:26,470
legal in las vegas it's completely recreationally legal here's the problem um if i smoke weed or if

1112
05:01:26,470 --> 05:01:34,569
i do like cbd like if i do if i smoke weed i i can't stream i can't like do anything

1113
05:01:35,529 --> 05:01:44,299
i just sit in like a room and just i i'm already so scatterbrained and so fucked up and so adhd

1114
05:01:45,659 --> 05:01:58,520
no i can't do anything like imagine if i like smoked and then screamed it'd be like you you

1115
05:01:58,520 --> 05:02:04,729
don't want to watch that stream and then but there's also like just oh there we go got it

1116
05:02:05,750 --> 05:02:13,290
finally um yeah there's also just cbd oil which you can just have this you can have no thc in it

1117
05:02:13,290 --> 05:02:23,020
or anything but yeah i actually have done it before i had a bottle it was like little droplets i would

1118
05:02:23,020 --> 05:02:49,540
put under my tongue i had tried it before go to chiropractor well um the theory is do i'm doing

1119
05:02:49,540 --> 05:02:56,680
stuff physical therapy first so once physical therapy is like hey this is gonna work or this

1120
05:02:56,680 --> 05:03:14,279
is not gonna work that's what we're doing first chiropractors are shit yeah but part of me is also

1121
05:03:14,279 --> 05:03:21,430
in that boat right now where i mean it i i gotta get like a clear clear picture of exactly what's

1122
05:03:21,430 --> 05:03:30,060
going on and right now it's like okay you might have this like prostagunditis but now you might

1123
05:03:30,139 --> 05:03:33,020
have rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid

1124
05:03:36,819 --> 05:03:44,790
apparently i have a high rheumatoid factor i did a blood test for it and i don't know

1125
05:03:44,790 --> 05:03:57,270
we're gonna check it out and we're gonna see and here's the thing it's i have autoimmune problems

1126
05:03:57,270 --> 05:04:07,689
already like the colitis thing that's autoimmune ra is autoimmune so the doctor was like you know

1127
05:04:07,689 --> 05:04:23,220
it's not against the realm of all possibility that it could you could just have ra and like okay but

1128
05:04:24,229 --> 05:04:32,919
once there's a clear indicator of what is actually fucking going on that's when you know you if it's

1129
05:04:32,919 --> 05:04:37,560
something if i have fucking like arthritis then whatever i have arthritis and you take medicine

1130
05:04:37,560 --> 05:04:41,959
for it you manage it and you'll be you're fine you'll be all right you might have good days you

1131
05:04:41,959 --> 05:04:48,150
might have bad days but you know you're still doing it see right now the problem is i'm not

1132
05:04:48,150 --> 05:04:54,150
being really treated for anything like we're like throwing darts and none of those darts have really

1133
05:04:54,150 --> 05:04:59,750
landed it significantly in any area that is like yeah that's definitive that's exactly what's going

1134
05:04:59,750 --> 05:05:06,439
on and uh while i uh talk to my friend on the telephone and just walk into every enemy

1135
05:05:15,400 --> 05:05:29,580
fuck throwing spaghetti at the ceiling you'll have problems getting into your clown car but

1136
05:05:29,580 --> 05:05:38,330
you can still stream yeah i'm not i'm not it i'm trying just to stay it's really easy to get

1137
05:05:38,330 --> 05:05:44,810
frustrated at something like this because when i when i have the camera on you probably see me like

1138
05:05:44,810 --> 05:05:53,990
lean back and like spread and it's like it's kind of why i'm doing that just do shrooms

1178
05:16:27,799 --> 05:16:34,729
without taking damage up to a maximum of minus six so as long as you don't get hit you get tears

1179
05:16:34,729 --> 05:16:47,180
up every room but that's not too i mean i'd rather just not take damage sometimes yeah i'd rather

1180
05:16:47,180 --> 05:16:58,840
just like not take damage sometimes blow up the angel right right that's tick yeah i didn't have

06:40:37,880 --> 06:40:41,740
as a streamer it's your duty to stream a hundred a thousand percent more during this time of

1447
06:40:41,740 --> 06:40:47,340
pandemic many of us are now out of work or had our hours cut and are bored at work without you

1448
06:40:47,340 --> 06:41:05,340
please i'm here i'm here the please at the end just for real though thanks to the 250 will the

1449
06:41:05,340 --> 06:41:09,180
city skyline stream be modded at least so you have custom buildings and vehicles

1450
06:41:10,060 --> 06:41:14,380
probably not initially because i've never played it before so i'd like to figure out how the game

1451
06:41:14,380 --> 06:41:20,970
works before i do any of that so initially i'm just probably going to play the game the way it's

1452
06:41:20,970 --> 06:41:29,689
intended to be played the first day maybe depending on what it does marv ash mcgalley

1453
06:41:29,689 --> 06:41:32,490
thanks for the 250 hi germ i want to thank you for these streams especially for the binding

1454
06:41:32,490 --> 06:41:37,049
of isaac content you're one of the only three things that made me forget for a while about

1455
06:41:37,049 --> 06:41:42,549
the lockdown ever since i started here in italy i wanted to celebrate my two-year sub by getting

1456
06:41:42,549 --> 06:41:46,869
the glue man shirt but i'll have to wait for the lockdown to be lifted because i'm afraid the

1457
06:41:46,869 --> 06:41:50,790
package could get stuck somewhere because of it keep planning to make it any more shirts in the

1458
06:41:50,790 --> 06:42:03,779
future um not immediately nothing in the immediate future but i do have plans of things i'd like to do

1459
06:42:06,900 --> 06:42:12,790
but none of them are really at the tip of the tongue right now they're all in the back of the

1460
06:42:12,790 --> 06:42:21,959
mouth someone will figure out what the fuck that meant so they'll i don't know but yeah at some

1461
06:42:21,959 --> 06:42:25,560
point in the future i do want to add because that teespring store is just there permanently so i'm

1462
06:42:25,560 --> 06:42:33,479
just gonna the idea is just add shit to that store as you know the years go by and they just

1463
06:42:33,479 --> 06:42:41,990
are there forever i'd like to put maybe a couple a year one or two a year maybe something like that

06:53:56,939 --> 06:54:13,560
people's lives their day-to-day lives i mean like we talked about yesterday just the fact that you

know you got people going to the grocery stores and buying everything and everybody's just preparing

1545
06:54:19,830 --> 06:54:27,830
for this catastrophe and it's just jeez every day there's something new whether it's

1546
06:54:29,110 --> 06:54:34,790
the government's trying to intervene and then dump a bunch of money into you know like the markets
