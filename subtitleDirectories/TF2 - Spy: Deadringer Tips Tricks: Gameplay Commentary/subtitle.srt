1
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:13,580
Hey, what is going on everybody? It's Jerma here again with another gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,019
This time we're playing as the Spy on Payload Badwater.

3
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:20,859
One of the more popular maps in the game. I've done a couple of commentaries on here, one or two.

4
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:24,859
Playing as the Spy as you see here with the Dead Ringer, the Big Erner,

5
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,699
and the new Diamondback, the new Spy Revolver.

6
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,980
I don't do anything with it. I don't even know why I had it equipped, to be honest.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,380
So don't expect me to go on some kind of tangent with three or four or five crits.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,500
I don't even get one crit in the gun one time.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,100
I kill a couple people with it though, so don't be too too concerned about it.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,549
And if you have not heard, tonight is the night that I do my live stream, my first ever live stream.

11
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:53,909
Don't be too mad because I'm not going to play Team Fortress 2 the entire time.

12
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,429
I'm going to play Team Fortress 2 for a while, but my plan guys is to play Deus Ex.

13
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,869
I haven't even loaded the game Deus Ex, so I have to install it.

14
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,109
So once that's installed, once it's all ready to go,

15
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:09,030
I want to stream that because I hear it is an unbelievably fun game.

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,810
There's a lot of choices in that game too,

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,250
so I'm sure you guys can help me pick the things when you're in the stream tonight.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,930
So be online at like 9 o'clock tonight Eastern Time.

19
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,530
I'm not sure what that is for anybody else's time zones,

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,180
but try and be on 9 o'clock Eastern Time. Should be a fun time.

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,700
And oh my goodness, it's already been a minute and a half and I haven't killed one person.

22
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,620
Let's change that right now. Medic Demoman coming up here towards the point.

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,379
They already capped it, it's okay, but I get one, two, and I turn around and this medic is kind of alone.

24
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:41,269
I thought he was going to kill me, but no, I pump him full of lead.

25
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,750
So I bagged the triple right there, which is a good thing,

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,750
because now they do not have a medic right here.

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,209
And I'm going to give you some spy tips right now, guys.

28
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:54,250
A lot of people see these as unorthodox or as not super elite or not pro,

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,810
but I have found them to work great.

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,689
I'm going to give you a number one thing to do when you're playing as a dead ringer spy.

31
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,969
If it doesn't work for you, I'm sorry, it's not going to work for everybody,

32
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,849
but it works for me and it works for other people I've told it to,

33
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:09,849
and hopefully you can use it too.

34
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:16,629
So here it is, the secret to playing spy from Jerma, walk backwards.

35
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:21,270
See what I'm doing right here? I am just facing forward at my teammates

36
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,909
and walking straight back and nobody gives a crap to spy check me.

37
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,949
So I can go on a little tangent and kill three or four people,

38
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,270
and then take the... once you kill one or two people,

39
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,449
guys, this is something you have to remember.

40
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:39,370
Once you kill one or two people and there's not a third or a fourth right in your reach,

41
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,530
have the dead ringer out ready to go because you're going to get killed.

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,090
The dead ringer is an escape tool. It's not meant to be an invisibility watch.

43
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,129
See how I pulled it out right after killing one person? Don't freak out.

44
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,930
See how I let that guy take a swing at me? I just kind of stood there.

45
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,050
They know you're a dead ringer, but it's okay because it doesn't matter

46
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,530
because they're not going to find you. The only person that's going to find you is a pyro.

47
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,250
That's it. Nobody else can find you unless, of course,

48
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,610
you're standing completely still and a heavy is unloading on you.

49
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,889
I don't understand why that heavy, speaking of heavies, he didn't do anything about it.

50
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,169
Dead ringer's out, killed one person, nobody noticed me, apparently,

51
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,370
and now let's turn and walk with the team. Hey, I'm on your team.

52
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,169
No, see? Look what just happened. I walked backwards and that soldier was

53
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,770
completely oblivious and now I go on a tangent here and I get three kills in a row.

54
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,289
That is the spy tip of the decade for you.

55
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:34,409
Disguise as somebody on the enemy team and walk backwards.

56
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:39,050
Now, obviously, this is a strategy that is only able to be used with a dead ringer.

57
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,650
Don't do this with the invisibility watch because there's a chance that somebody could

58
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,090
just stray fire and kill you. That's why the dead ringer has to be out

59
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,530
when you're backwards and look at this. This whole room, they all want me dead and

60
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,449
I actually get one kill with that revolver. I thought that was pretty funny.

61
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:57,289
You have to probably imagine they were on the mic all screaming about me at the same time

62
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,449
and the whole team was pretty much in that room which I can imagine because I was alive

63
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,370
for about four minutes right there just killing a bunch of people out of their spawn over and over

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,289
and over again. Coming around this corner right here, I just want to get the dead ringer activated.

65
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,169
I don't really care about walking backwards at this point. There's a lot of people there

66
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,770
so I figured one of them would have probably spy checked me. I want to just get up here in this

67
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,259
corner. This is a great place to hang out as a spy. Get this heavy. I believe it's a domination.

68
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,819
It is, but who cares? Just trying to get someone to hit me. Come on, somebody hit me. There we go.

69
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,139
Coming around back up these stairs, a great place and we're going to do it all over again.

70
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,420
Spy is all about routine. You just got to get in the flow. You just got to get a feel for the class

71
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,860
because you kind of do the same thing over and over again. You rinse and repeat,

72
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,180
get hit with the dead ringer, come right around, exact same route, do the same exact thing,

73
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,939
get hit again, pull the dead ringer out, pull it around, go the same exact way,

74
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:50,740
jump across the stairs, do it again. People eventually will start to really get really

75
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,660
pissed off and really start to look for you and that's what you want. You want to cause chaos

76
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,300
because the longer they're looking for you, the longer they're not going to be capping the point

77
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,379
or not going to be going for the objective because remember guys, everything in this game is timed.

78
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:13,959
There's a time limit on every map so if you can take seconds off that clock by having important

79
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,160
classes come after you, looking around for you, always being afraid of you, you did your job and

80
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,399
your team is probably going to win the game because those last 10 seconds, even if it's 10-20 seconds,

81
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,839
overtime and everything like that is incredibly important so you could just screw the whole team

82
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,040
over. So I get this demo man with an ice stab, come up here and watch this stair stab fail.

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,019
I couldn't believe this. I was so pissed about this. What was wrong with that? My knife went

84
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:46,220
up and everything. The animation went up. I had it. It should have registered. It just didn't work.

85
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,949
Whatever. I've never done a stair stab before really so I was so upset about that.

86
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,509
Less than 40 seconds left here now. Coming around the corner. Kritzkrieg demo right here doesn't

87
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,709
really do too much so kill the medic. He had low health anyway so it's not a big deal. Hanging out

88
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:07,589
here, nobody saw me apparently. Nobody cared to look at me when I was disguising again.

89
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:12,170
Back stab is heavy. Go for the medic but it doesn't matter. I miss. Just trying to get behind

90
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,449
everybody and now we're at the point where there's less than 15 seconds left. I run into

91
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:24,870
another heavy right here and watch this guy. This is weird. What are you doing? Now you realize

92
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,699
I'm trying to kill you? What are you doing? So we end up winning this match. They get overtime but

93
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,860
it doesn't matter. Get a couple more people right here right before the match ends. Maybe one. I

94
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,579
think it's two. No, it is one. Thank you all so much for watching. I really appreciate everybody

95
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:43,939
that checks out my videos. Come to my live stream tonight guys. 9 p.m. Eastern Standard

96
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:49,060
Time in the United States. Check your local listings and find out what time that is for you.

97
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,240
Hope to see you all there. Should be a great time. Take care everybody. See you soon.
