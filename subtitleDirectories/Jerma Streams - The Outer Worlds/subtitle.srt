00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:10,279
Good afternoon. How are you? Good to see you. Welcome to another broadcast. This is broadcast

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:22,679
number 862. Thanks for joining me. We're almost at that thousand. We'll be we'll be there soon.

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:35,509
We're almost at that thousand. And then just like y2k, when we cross over to from 999 to 1000,

4
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:49,340
00. The whole stream ends forever. Because I don't know what the fuck to do. It just goes back to

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:01:02,100
zero. So I have to start a new channel and go from zero again. That's fair. Now, how are you guys

6
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,459
doing? We got a lot of things. We got a lot of things to talk about. I mean, like, seriously,

7
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:19,989
there's too many things for us to discuss. So where we start? Let's start. Let me like,

8
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:33,579
let me like not be fucking 70. Okay, so first things first. As of tomorrow, there's going to

9
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:39,340
be a green screen discussion night. No, not a night, a green screen discussion channel in the

10
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,650
discord allows be a green screen actions channel that coming back. This is as of

11
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:50,329
later tonight or tomorrow night, it'll be there. It's going to be there.

12
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:58,090
As of the second week of December, getting back in the studio. So that is now actually happening

13
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,590
that is set in stone to be the somewhere in the second week of December, I'll give you the date

14
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,699
when I get it. So that will be there. Please, but get a better camera this time. Don't worry

15
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:19,349
that the first one was just a test to see if it was fun to do. The second one I'm going to have,

16
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:27,449
I'll actually have a better camera and it'll be better footage to use. Pogging so hard right now

17
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:36,150
will hold your breath because only a few days after that. So let's say that that's somewhere

18
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:46,629
between December 9 and December 12 or whatever. Hopefully, somewhere around the 15th of December

19
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:56,139
is going to be the Minecraft fuck the king stream. That is we're shooting for December 15.

20
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:07,539
My breath is held. You can exhale now. Repeat everything you just said. I didn't hear it.

21
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:15,699
Well, just wait like an hour when this stream goes into my videos tab and I'm still broadcasting,

22
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,819
but you can like catch up on the last hour and a half and just watch the very beginning.

23
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:28,699
Explain the Minecraft stream. Not yet. Because there's a ton of moving parts.

24
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:37,400
On this stream that I need to have real details before I start throwing up bullshit.

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,800
I don't want to just completely talk nonsense. I want it to be real, real, real info. So I'm not

26
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:51,719
at that point yet, but it's being developed at this current at this current moment. It's where

27
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,120
we're like we're in like the pre alpha stage of trying to figure out how everything's going to

28
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,780
work. But we're trying to do it for the 15th. That's announcement number two, announcement number

29
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,620
three. So you get the good stuff out first, right? That's in my opinion. You get the good

30
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:16,100
things out there first. This week, what Pog? What fucking green screen DLC for free Pog? That's

31
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,779
like December fucking like 10th. What Minecraft stream the king the huge like that's happening

32
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,060
like three days left. I'm going to be streaming not very much this week.

33
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:34,790
I have another endoscopy that I have to do this week. And Thanksgiving is this week as well.

34
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:42,660
So these streams are going to be shaved. I'm still streaming the next three days in a row.

35
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:50,779
But we're going to be shaving these streams because of Thanksgiving and because I have to

36
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:59,899
start to prepare physically and mentally for a second endoscopy. So the week of Thanksgiving

37
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:07,019
is full of stuff. So these next three streams are only going to be like four or five hours long each.

38
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:09,740
I'm still streaming every day. I'm going to be streaming on Thanksgiving too,

39
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:24,889
but only for about four or five hours. So yeah, and well, and it's I'm not doing I did a colonoscopy

40
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:32,649
a few months ago. And this is a we're going instead of up, we're going down. So this is

41
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:38,490
going into my mouth and throat down into my stomach down to my other digestive places.

42
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:50,149
So still a pain in the ass. Stop talking. What? Why did what do you mean? Why did I say that?

43
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,740
That's what it is. That's what's happened. That is what the procedure is. They put it.

44
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:03,980
That's a medical procedure. What I can't explain them what a medical what medical procedure this

45
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:17,939
is. It's medicine. I don't want to hear it. Anyways, so let's use the time wisely. I'm going to be

46
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,579
starting Outer Worlds today. And that's probably what we're going to do for the next few streams.

47
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:32,329
Can you stream your endoscopy live on Twitch? We already made that joke like three months ago.

48
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:43,769
But let's get to it. Because I want to utilize the time here. Wednesday rumble 2019.

49
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:50,569
A lot of stuff going on. A lot of stuff going on. December. Let me just tell you.

50
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:03,500
December is going to be full of stuff. Because the green screen stream, the fuck the king streams,

51
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,420
because there's gonna be multiple streams. I'm not just doing that once it's gonna be too outrageous.

52
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:19,240
The end of the year worst of the year awards and the German rumble gonna be a

53
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,439
December is gonna be a month of working. There's gonna be a lot of stuff there.

54
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:34,410
You might not want to use 2020. That's kind of I don't know, we will do the same thing we did last

55
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:44,089
time. Rumble confirmed. Yeah, the rumble might actually look, the rumble might actually have to

56
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:56,699
be delayed to January 8th. Just pretend it was, it's like, who cares if it's not 2019?

57
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:13,639
Because then it's like, it's eight days into 2020. New year's rumble. Well, the new year stream

58
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:24,709
is gonna be the 2019 shit awards. I've got a lot of pieces I'm moving around and we'll see if it

59
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:34,019
fits. But it should. It should. But here's the one thing I just said, somebody said this, they take

60
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:43,139
your time to make it amazing. I don't want to have a scenario where just because, oh, I got

61
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,700
this other stuff going on in December, but I got to have the rumble in December. Just get it out.

62
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:55,500
No, no, no, no. I want to put love into those things. So if it works, it works and if it doesn't,

63
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:05,419
then it's going to be pushed off. Each rumble and each wrestling card event that I've done

64
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:11,340
over the last three, four years, I've had a ton of fun making them that I've really loved them.

65
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,700
I don't want it to be a get it out because you have to at that point.

66
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:28,659
But let's start the art of worlds. Welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining me on this week of

67
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:39,590
Thanksgiving and endoscopy back to back. Here we go. Story. I can't even hear it.

68
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:46,539
You still can't hear it. Use this mode if you enjoy story more than combat. In story mode,

69
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:55,139
enemies have less health and do less damage. This is the recommended mode for your first

70
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,980
play session. In normal mode, enemies have standard health and damage. This mode is for

71
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,139
players who are looking for an extra challenge. In hard mode, enemies have more health and do

72
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:12,659
more damage and then supernova. You can tell that this is actually hard when supernova has

73
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:19,799
patch notes. If you reduce the difficulty, you cannot renew. Enemies have more health and deal

74
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:26,100
more damage. You must eat, drink and sleep to survive. Companions can die permanently.

75
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,940
Crippled body and limb conditions can only be healed with bed rest. Weapons and armor work

76
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:37,179
very poorly at zero durability. You can only fast travel to your ship. You can only manually save

77
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:50,139
while inside your ship. No, I'm just, I'm just going to do normal move cursor in the right spot.

78
00:10:50,139 --> 00:11:02,659
Uh oh. It's doing this thing again, isn't it? Wait. Oh shit. It's doing, it's doing the OBS

79
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:08,970
cursor. Right. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I know how to fix this. I know people are going to puke

80
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:22,139
because they see me. I know. I know. Don't look at my settings. Still doing it, isn't it? Why is

81
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:36,940
this even, why is this even possible? It doesn't make any sense. What the fuck is this doing? Hold

82
00:11:36,940 --> 00:12:07,419
on. Scale resolution to, why is this scaling to 1536 by 864? Is that in the right spot?

83
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,639
All right. It's in the right spot now, but what did I just do to the resolution?

84
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:34,659
Did anything change? No, now it's like fucked up again. Okay. I have no idea.

85
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,179
Just move on. I kind of can't. Hold on. Why would this even be happening?

86
00:12:44,220 --> 00:13:07,850
Okay. Now it's like it's fixed, but it's too big. What the fuck is that? All right. I think it's,

87
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:21,590
I think it's ready to go. Right? Game sucks. No, it's not. Game sucks. It's Streamlabs OBS

88
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:26,629
sucks. And I say this every fucking stream. Why do I still use this? What's the, why do I keep

89
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:38,090
using this? Am I, am I like a next level Omega lazy where I won't just uninstall this program?

90
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:49,159
I had regular OBS and it worked just fucking fine. Why do I have this program? There's one

91
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:55,320
feature on it that's actually good and all the other ones suck. I need to stop being so

92
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,960
fucking a hyper Omega lazy. All right. I can't, I can't get up. I can't get upset.

93
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:14,139
All right. Back to what we were talking about before. Normal or hard. Fuck. Why would that

94
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:22,500
even happen? Normal's too easy. Hard. I'll do hard. All right. Hard. Hard. Subtitles on,

95
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:32,149
subtitles on, subtitles on. Sure. Let's go. All right. Here we go. Like the scaling is just bugged

96
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:38,679
out. Why stay earthbound when it awaits you in the stars? Come to Halcyon, the only colony on the

97
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:48,629
edge of the frontier with minutes. Thanks to the comfort and safety of your very own hibernation

98
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,669
chamber. You'll wake up in a perfect society designed to maximize your productivity with

99
00:14:53,669 --> 00:15:03,399
minor term of service. You will become the master of when you go out of this Halcyon colony.

100
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:10,840
Top secret 10, 23, 23, 20 incident report. Colony ship Hope found drifting colonists. Something

101
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:17,960
happened. Hope to be left at edge of colony. Top secret alert breach of Hope security cord

102
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:27,940
or unidentified ship. I got Frank's red hot down there. Awesome. We can put it on everything. It's

103
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:41,720
delicious. I saw the video. I saw the video. I know. Look, that's for the person that made that

104
00:15:41,720 --> 00:16:05,210
video. That's for you. That's fugitive wanted by Halcyon. Hundreds of thousands of colonists

105
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:10,009
left to drift out here forever. Just to keep from damaging the board's bottom line.

106
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:23,799
This is a which one are you scenario, right? All right, here we go. Attributes, body strength,

107
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:28,519
dexterity, mind, perception, personality. Okay, here we go. How many points do I get?

108
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:35,259
All right, let's do this. Let's let's do this the way that it should be. Okay,

109
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:41,830
temperament. And you can see what it does on the right. Okay.

110
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:49,480
Temperament improves your natural health regeneration. Max your strength out. Okay,

111
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,240
strength affects melee weapon. Do I, okay, do I want to be melee or do I want to be ranged?

112
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:02,740
Attack speed and ranged weapon reload speed and the amount you can carry it. One handed melee,

113
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,140
two enemy heavy weapons block inspiration and intimidate and you can carry more.

114
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:15,369
Okay, intelligence is long guns, persuade, hack, medical science and determination.

115
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:22,869
Perception is ham guns, long guns, heavy weapons, dodge lockpick and engineering.

116
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:31,160
You need to be the low IQ. I'm not that low. I don't, okay, I don't want this to be a stream

117
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,920
where we laugh every time I open a dialogue box because I can't even function. Is that possible?

118
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,740
Low IQ, high melee.

119
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:55,269
Next. Did you just next? Did I just get nexted in the game? The game crashed. Where's my mouse?

120
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:05,940
What the fuck? Oh, okay. That was weird. I always got forced into another game. All right, let's do

121
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,559
charm. Charm affects faction reputation and companion ability cooldowns. Persuade,

122
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,140
lie, intimidate, hacks. This one had a, what are those called again? Social life.

123
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:26,839
I mean, come on, that's pretty good. I'm pretty good at lying and I'm very good at inspiring.

124
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,920
Companion ability refresh, positive faction reputation, negative faction reputation reactions.

125
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,900
All right, temperament, low average. You need a navigational computer to find your temper.

126
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,980
Oh, I get points for doing that. Okay. I bet you could thaw yourself with sheer rage.

127
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:54,420
I mean, I'm kind of hot-headed, but health regen, that sucks. Having no health regen.

128
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:03,099
No, I'm good. No, that's too much charm. All right, strength. Let's do, I think I want to use guns,

129
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:19,910
though, like handguns. Isn't that cool? Heavy weapons and handguns? No, temperament is a dumb stat.

130
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:25,670
Yeah, I'm doing, I want to do heavy weapon. No, I want to do like handguns. I want to be like a

131
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:38,099
revolver spinner. I got pretty good dexterity in real life. Okay. One-handed melee. These are,

132
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:46,470
well, one-handed melee. I can still do melee. One-handed melee. I want weapon reload. You've

133
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:55,079
seen me play the connect. I can move around real fast. I'll have to use smaller words around you.

134
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:09,029
I'll have to use smaller words around you. Long guns. I don't really care, but minus 20%

135
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:13,349
critical strike damage. That's terrible. You took a few blows to the brain band.

136
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:27,220
This is below, okay, below average does not mean idiot. I can't go lower than that. If you're below

137
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:37,319
average intelligence, that doesn't mean you speak in one word sentences. Charismatic enough to give

138
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:43,769
a chairman for his bits. Charismatic enough for the bits. He's already, you got, it's, this

139
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:52,619
guy's already got me figured out. All right. I want one-handed melee and handguns. There we go. I got

140
00:20:52,619 --> 00:21:03,339
perception, extra headshots, and I can charm you. I might not be that intelligent, but is that really

141
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:09,880
going to give me stupid dialogue options? All right, let's go. That's it. I'm sticking with it.

142
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:27,500
Skill shit. Okay. One-handed melee. Range defense dialogue. Low IQ cowboy. Yeah. Well, to be fair,

143
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:34,650
I don't know, education wasn't the most important fucking thing back in the cowboy times, back in

144
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:49,349
the fucking like saloon times. That's a lie. Was that a lie? Okay, that's a lie. Persuade.

145
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:55,029
Humans have a 20% chance to cower in fear for three seconds after the first time you hit them.

146
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:05,539
15% chance auto, auto-mechanicals will slowly attack other enemies instead of you.

147
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:16,700
All right, handguns. You are going to paint the system red, my friend. Unlock TTD location hit

148
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:30,740
effects. 87.9% handgun crit chance and handgun sway. All right. Yep. I like it. Sneak. Oh,

149
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm not sneaky. All right, let's go. That sounds all right. Handgun and one-handed weapons.

150
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:48,039
And lying to people. Aptitude. Oh, yeah. Calling a sound like a nice entry-level career for a

151
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:54,309
person of your skill. Expanding humanity's reach by civilizing the cosmic frontier.

152
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:58,390
Was ambitious enough without worrying about your day job. You have the rest of your life to

153
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,740
decide how you can be useful in Halcyon. Determination. What does determination do?

154
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:13,740
Beverage service technician. Drink effect duration plus 3%. Bureaucrat. Cashier subgrade

155
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:23,400
non-supervisory. Construction electrician class of wire spooler. Elevator operations specialist.

156
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:30,170
Is this the person that's in the elevator that's pressing the buttons to go up and down floors and

157
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,509
say like have a nice day or is this the person that made the elevator? Oh, it is the person that

158
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:41,509
okay. A proper lift goes up and down. Anyone who thinks otherwise isn't fit to wear the badge.

159
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:46,309
Being a specialist means something where you come from commitment to upward and downward mobility.

160
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:51,460
All right. Well, that could mean anything. That could mean that you're like expert button pusher.

161
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:59,819
Factory worker dodge plus one former farmer dirt. You got into this business for the tubers.

162
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:07,609
Worms. But you stayed for the plowing. Planting, pruning, and plucking.

163
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,809
It is an honest work if you come home clean. Worms need dirt and food needs worms. You're

164
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:18,099
just doing your part for the worms. I got into this business for the tubers.

165
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:31,130
N-ray damage received minus 3%. What does N, what does, is that like, is that uh like radiation in

166
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:40,420
like you know radiation? Food additive tester. Sometimes quality control means sampling a delicious

167
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:51,259
borst smoothie. Janitor sanitation class. Tossball team mascot. Okay, that's I would probably do that.

168
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:56,250
There isn't a problem in all the cosmos that team spirit and a big stick couldn't solve together.

169
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,890
Your last major head injury in the field knocked some extra cheer into you and you've been a rising

170
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,849
star in the tossballs competitive mascot food chain ever since. Doesn't matter. No one knows

171
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:12,089
your face under the mask. You share the glory with the team. Now's your chance to have vengeance.

172
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:20,410
Good. Medical technician, meh. Safety inspector, who cares. Scientist assistant level zero, no.

173
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:26,569
Uh, the sub sous chef. Ooh, how many of these can I have? Just one? I hope you know how to cook

174
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:40,420
with mostly inorganic material. Just one? How degrading. Inspiration. Dirt farmer, but

175
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,220
yeah that's more accurate. Prefer our food canned. All right, that's that's more accurate.

176
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:09,369
How detailed is this? I got huge eyebrow bones. I mean I'm just making me.

177
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:30,119
My eyes big? No. Here's something about making yourself in a character creator. Everybody can

178
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:35,240
relate to this. I know you can. If there are people watching you make yourself in a character

179
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:42,970
creator and you make yourself look wicked good. You almost feel like you're being judged by

180
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,529
everybody. Like dude, OK, you know, you're not like, come on, like you got like that chin like

181
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:53,619
that, like chiseled like that. It's like, oh, yeah, it looks like me, I think. And when you

182
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:58,900
make other people in the room, you ever have that problem? Yeah, make me next, make me next. And

183
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:07,880
you're like, oh yeah, OK, man, look over. Oh, I mean, you're like, oh, I can't do that because

184
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,240
I can't. You have a kind of a small mouth, but I can't. I don't want you to. I don't want you to

185
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,920
know that. So I'm just going to do this right here. That's like normal.

186
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:22,940
No, you're just everything is normal. You're everything about you is completely and totally

187
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:31,460
fucking normal, dude. Like your nose is big, but like your everything is completely fine.

188
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:38,630
That's you. I can't. I know they have the same. That's why I leave the room when they're making

189
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:44,359
me. Oh, it's your turn to make me. You know what? I got to use the bathroom and I'll just leave for

190
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:50,059
20 minutes so then they don't feel pressured. And then they go, OK, that's like what his face

191
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:55,420
looks like. That's what his eyes look like. All right, let's go. What was I doing with this?

192
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:00,539
I'm going to try to make me. This is what I think I look like. But you can't. It's impossible to do

193
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:14,380
that. No, I'm doing it to myself. I'm doing the thing I just told you about to myself because I

194
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:28,259
know you're watching. My mouth doesn't go that far. I don't know. I do have a fairly large nose.

195
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,099
I know that to be the case, but it's not that it's not like bulbous.

196
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,519
It's big, but it's also thin at the same time. I have a really weird nose and it goes sideways.

197
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:09,900
Now, this is not that it really is not that detailed. You're right.

198
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:38,099
I don't know. I don't know. I can't do it. I have to leave the room for 20 minutes. You guys have

199
00:29:38,099 --> 00:30:03,190
to make me. It's an FPS. Who cares? I do. This doesn't look fucking anything like me.

200
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:27,109
This is like Woody Harrelson. All right, let's go. Whatever. I mean, I guess I kind of do look a

201
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:46,700
little I could be like Woody Harrelson's nephew. I could be somewhere. All right, here we go. Let's

202
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,180
move on. Name. Oh, this is important. This is such a bad character. This is like this.

203
00:30:52,059 --> 00:31:20,009
This is that AI created. This person doesn't exist algorithm. All right. Name. That's not

204
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:35,880
what Junko looks like. Dirt man. Whatever. I'm just going to be Junko. Who fucking gives a shit?

205
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:54,920
Next skills. All right, we got handguns is 30. One handed. 13. Dodge, persuade, lie.

206
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:03,019
This guy kind of sucks. He just lies. I'm just the side goblin character.

207
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:20,009
I'm not an actual protagonist. Oh, well. All right, let's play. Oh, look at you. You're like,

208
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:46,250
Great Scott. Bro, I fucking love Rick and Morty. It's season four. Is it coming?

209
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:04,230
Damn, the internet did a full 180 on Rick and Morty. Like it was internet loved Rick and Morty

210
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,950
and then internet fucking hated Rick and Morty. All it took was a McDonald's sauce for everyone

211
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:35,420
to hate that show. It's going to happen to you. Hey, I've been around almost 10 years.

212
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:42,779
This is season 10. There you are. Wondering what's going on. A bit of bad news there. I'm afraid your

213
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:48,859
colony was inexplicably knocked out of skip space. I'm forced to complete its journey at sublight

214
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:55,579
speeds. This means that you and every other columnist on hope have been in suspended animation for

215
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,220
70 years, give or take. Normally, reviving someone after so long leads to some quite

216
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,099
horrifying results. It's called explosive cell death, but it's really more.

217
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:09,980
Jeremy's going to turn into the Simpsons eventually. No, I'll just quit.

218
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:17,019
Oh, yes. Well, not to worry. I pumped your body full of a special concoction I devised

219
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:22,139
to keep you from dying so horrifically, hopefully at all. But I guess we'll see.

220
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:27,340
Yes. Unfortunately, I used the last of my chemical supplies saving you.

221
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:33,739
I know it's a lot to ask, but I must have your help securing more if we're to save the rest

222
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:40,219
of your fellow colonists. I'd see it done myself, of course, but the board has a sizable bounty on

223
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:47,179
my head. Now my ship is inoperative, but I've managed to hire a smuggler to help you out.

224
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:58,230
Oh, I see we're in position. Good luck. All right, it's time. Any NPC can die.

225
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:05,219
It's a good thing he got out of my way, because he would have been the first.

226
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:17,989
This is so funny, XD. I'm lulling so hard. Is this thing working? I would relax.

227
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:23,449
There you are. Now, where were we? Oh, yes, a smuggler. His name is Hawthorne,

228
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:28,969
and he should be waiting for you at the landing site. He's to be your chauffeur, so to speak.

229
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:34,250
Not to worry. I'm told he's a specialist, dashing gunslinger, one-of-a-kind ship,

230
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:40,010
that sort of thing. You'll like him, I'm sure. I've also outfitted you with a simple wireless

231
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:45,929
monitor so I can track your progress. I'll check in with you as soon as you land. Good luck.

232
00:35:52,099 --> 00:36:06,619
Let's land on Earth. Hold ups four. You guys need to relax.

233
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:15,900
We're not even, like, 15 minutes into the game.

234
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,510
Wait, he's dead?

235
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:37,269
I was gonna say I can walk, but I can't.

236
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:58,949
Hmm, spacebar jump over obstacles. Interesting. Can't even see my feet. This game belongs in the

237
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:10,969
trash can. I can't even see my feet walking. Game should be deleted. A sprat. Whoa. Whoa!

238
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,670
I gotta react to this! It's like a lizard!

239
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:31,179
Okay, sprint is... Do I have to hold it? No. Is it, like, loot that I'm gonna miss or something?

240
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:41,820
Second dead NPC. I was already here. Okay, while sneaking, use tall grass, rocks, and other cover

241
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:47,659
to hide from enemies. Use this to sneak past enemies or sneak up to them, initiate combat.

242
00:37:47,659 --> 00:38:01,190
All right, Adreno. What the hell is that? The awareness meters over enemy heads tell you if

243
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:14,630
they are unaware, suspicious, investigating, or alerted. Right, so just hide. Oh, that's the

244
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:24,409
awareness meter. Got it. Just sneak around. Did I just get spotted? Did I get spotted in the tutorial?

245
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:37,579
Whatever. Path to ship. Let's keep going. What's going on?

246
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,389
The game looks pretty good. It's one of those games, though, and I'm already gonna give it

247
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:58,710
a criticism, but this is just a personal preference. Only personal preference. This

248
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:06,539
is not actually meant as a game sucks mentality. It's a... It reminds me of the way that Wildstar

249
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:10,940
looked, and I didn't like that style. It hurt my head. What an F is heal.

250
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,849
NPC. The second I have an opportunity.

251
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:41,539
Medical five. Sit still. I'll patch you up. What happened to you, Spacer's blood? See,

252
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:46,099
I'm not speaking in one sentence dialogue options. Do I have medical five?

253
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:04,489
How are you feeling? What happened to you? Did I just heal him to kill him?

254
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:13,829
I want you to feel good. I want you to be able to fight back. How are you feeling? What happened to

255
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:17,349
you?

256
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:34,230
Blocked off the exit with those canisters. What's this about marauders? What were you doing out

257
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,710
here? You're hiding in a cave and you blocked off the exit. You're as good as dead. Spacer's choice

258
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:43,349
policy clearly stipulates that dead and as good as dead are two completely different properties

259
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:49,030
of matter. Unless I'm dead, I'm contractually obligated to attend to my post. I will report

260
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,909
that illegally grounded spacecraft if it is the last thing I do. See those canisters by the

261
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:59,030
entrance? Marauders come sniffing around in here and I can take them all out with a single shot.

262
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:10,010
Not bad, huh? I've got a better idea. Give me your gun and I'll go get help. Someone grounded

263
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,090
the ship illegally? Well, don't worry. I'll take care of them for you. You're an idiot. Give me

264
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:24,250
your gun before you get yourself killed. I've got a better idea. Give me your gun. All right, give me

265
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:30,780
your gun. Yeah, okay. You look like you know your way around a gun. You've got some spare ammo.

266
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,780
Not counting the bullet in my side. I want that one too. You can have my saber too.

267
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:39,579
I've got medical five. I'll take it out. All Spacer's Choice weapons are now 30% less likely

268
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:46,380
to malfunction. You've tried the best, now try the rest. Spacer's Choice. Yes, nailed it that time.

269
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:56,179
Where am I? You hit your head or something? You're in Emerald Vale. We're a Spacer's Choice

270
00:41:56,179 --> 00:42:01,860
community. Edgewater's a little ways down. Don't kill. The prettiest place in the Vale. Be sure

271
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:08,519
to stop by a provisioner's for a can of our famous salt tuna. Okay, do you know anything

272
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:14,199
about The Hope? The Hope? Let's get info. Is that some sort of fancy new drug? Are you with anti-CLEO

273
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:18,840
or something? Don't take this the wrong way or nothing, but I'm not allowed to fraternize

274
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:42,309
with CLEO workers. Company policy. All right, I'm off. Oh, cool. Guard Pelham. Shoot. All right,

275
00:42:42,309 --> 00:43:02,469
how do I get through this? I don't want to use this yet. Kill him. No, not yet. He was useful

276
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:09,880
to me. He gave me a gun. Shoot it, but if I don't want to, should I shoot it? I guess I'm...

277
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:45,909
What? They're food! Tactical time dilation. Due to complications stemming from being revived after

278
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:51,110
an extended hibernation, your brain processes time differently. Pressing the tactical time

279
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:57,300
dilation button slows down the world, giving you time to think as well as take action. So,

280
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,139
this is like the VAT system. You have a limited time in this mode. Standing still drains your

281
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:10,659
TTD meter very slowly. While moving an attack to drain it faster, the TTD meter refreshes slowly

282
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:22,010
over time. Okay, so it is Q. Some objects explode when hit. Shoot them when enemies are nearby for

283
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:37,659
an explosive surprise. Just don't be too close. Explosions just cause percussions. NPC? All right.

284
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:55,670
All right, that's two NPCs dead. Double? Wait, what was it? Oh, there's a double jump? Space is

285
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:02,940
like a dodge. Double tapping is a dodge. Corpses and... I thought that was a fucking monster.

286
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,460
Corpses and containers hold items that you can take. You can take them all. I want to take them

287
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:18,409
all. Okay, multiple squirrels. What do we got? All right. Brew? Magpick? I got bananas. Apples.

288
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:24,090
Bananas. Hacking and picking locks. Your hacking and lockpick skills help you get into places

289
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:30,250
you're not meant to be. Magpicks are used to break open locks and bypass shunts are used

290
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:35,909
to break computer encryptions. And I have not high enough skill. If your skill is high enough

291
00:45:35,909 --> 00:45:40,389
to break the security, you'll see how many magpicks or shunts you need and how long it will take.

292
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:45,750
Raising your skill will lower the number of items used and speed up the process.

293
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:50,150
So this is... Okay, I can do this. Two seconds to pick this?

294
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:57,260
Ooh, this is two-handed melee. I don't need... I don't do two-handed melee.

295
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,239
You found a new weapon! The weapon button... The weapon switch button allows you to rotate

296
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:08,440
between the weapons you've equipped on the inventory screen. Okay, so I have an inventory

297
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:19,340
fish sticks, bread and sliced bread. Okay, whatever. How do I get to the inventory? I...

298
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:26,619
TNL weapon safety. Weapon management. You can have up to four weapons equipped at any time by

299
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:32,010
dragging them up to the slots, right? You can also inspect your weapons, compare them, flag them as

300
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:37,050
junk, or break them down to parts. If you have an engineering skill, they can repair weapons on this

301
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:42,090
screen. Take care of your TNL weapons and they'll take care of your enemies. Ooh, this is one-handed.

302
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:51,139
All right, this is 73 DPS. It's the same thing. What happened to my mouse? What's going on? What the

303
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:58,869
fuck was that? All right, bleed, bleed, wait. Yeah, just bring them up here. Scrap this one. Yeah,

304
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:12,980
scrap it, break it down to parts. And break this one down to parts too. Good. This block.

305
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:19,670
So this is a slash. Most melee weapons can do a three-swing combo.

306
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:43,619
Okay, cool. Let's go. I'm actually getting shot in the head and going,

307
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:53,239
huh? Where did that come from? So that just slows down in time. All right, I get...

308
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:03,130
You've unlocked leap. Double click jump when moving forward to leap forward. Great for

309
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:24,280
closing distances. All right, did this guy drop anything? Would the other guy die? That's cool.

310
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,800
Lag. Is my computer not good enough to handle this game in very high settings? I don't think it is.

311
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,070
Wait, those are... They don't have... Okay.

312
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,699
Kill, kill, kill. No.

313
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,340
All right, let me be clear about something very, very quickly. This is my ship.

314
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:23,179
We're talking about, right? That's mine. Right. Okay. So it's just a landing violation. Let it

315
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:27,340
go. So I heard I found one of your teammates holed up in a cave. No, that guy, whatever,

316
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,780
who cares about that guy. I've already dealt with a few of these marauders. Not impressed.

317
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,460
It's just to let it go. It's a landing violation.

318
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:38,539
No way. Once we've dealt with these marauders, I'm hunting that sick freak down. I just, you know,

319
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,699
need a couple of winks to catch my breath. Stretch my legs, son.

320
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:52,230
Do you space the choice guards back down from a challenge? I bet you could get these marauders to

321
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:57,349
tell you where the owner of that ship is. Guess I'll have to give you a zero on my customer

322
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:02,789
satisfaction survey. Don't worry. Use the title. Handle it. You know, looks like I'm going to have

323
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:07,670
to give you a zero. You're a, you're a fucking LinkedIn account. You're a Yelp review.

324
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:47,610
I swear. But they have armor. They have armor. If I attack, they have armor. I'm going to get

325
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:54,920
destroyed. They have like rifles. They don't have armor on their head.

326
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:02,579
Doesn't matter. This is, they're going to find out this is my ship. What do I do?

327
00:51:03,219 --> 00:51:22,760
This is, they're going to find out this is my ship. Do I have to hide the bodies?

328
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:45,539
You can fast travel to locations you have unlocked by opening your map and selecting

329
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:51,769
your destinations. Please be informed that this vessel contains no valuable plunder.

330
00:51:51,769 --> 00:51:54,570
Landing site discovered. This is, this is not my ship.

331
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:16,019
Oh, all doors are on security lockdown. Nice try marauder. You know what I can appreciate?

332
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:20,539
Helen, this is, let me appreciate something in the game so far. Pause it. Um,

333
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:26,739
in other games that are like this, like the fallout style kind of first person RPG type games,

334
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:31,619
it takes forever to kill an NPC. I shot that person in the head twice and they were instantly

335
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:43,449
dead. That's, I kind of appreciate that a little. Marauder, please be informed the ship has no crew

336
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:52,070
for you to murder. I should be looting this stuff, shouldn't I? Marauder, please be informed that

337
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:59,110
ignoring me is dangerous for your health. Did I kill this? Where's the computer's brain?

338
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:22,949
Sealed. Well, let's just go this way. I can't do that. Smile for my surveillance device,

339
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:27,929
marauder. I am tracking your every move. Really? Oh, did they get me?

340
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:35,449
Unauthorized access of spacefaring vessels is a crime. Please submit yourself to the authorities.

341
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:43,610
Uh oh. Uh oh. Marauder, I am Ada, the autonomous digital astrogator of this vessel.

342
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:49,530
Please be informed that I am authorized to use violent retribution against unwanted solicitors.

343
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,849
Can you lie to computers? Please return any misappropriated equipment and exit this vessel

344
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:58,809
in an orderly fashion. Failure to do so will result in your immediate destruction.

345
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:03,130
But lies don't work on computers. They don't understand what that even means.

346
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:10,170
They just, it's binary. They can go 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. They don't understand like the nuances of

347
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:16,039
telling fibs. How would they know that? I'm not here to misappropriate anything. I don't

348
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:18,920
appreciate being talked to though. What are you going to do? Self-destruct?

349
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,920
Jettison procedures initiated. Please engage in airlocks.

350
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:29,690
Prepare to eject all board parties in five, two, one.

351
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:38,230
Great, I'm getting shot into space twice in one day. Is something supposed to be happening?

352
00:54:38,869 --> 00:54:43,269
You are still here. My deception protocols have failed.

353
00:54:43,269 --> 00:54:46,869
Oh, you think you can lie to me? I need your permission to express disappointment.

354
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:51,900
Yeah, you can't lie. I told you computers can't fucking lie. I need to get this ship in the air.

355
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:58,869
Is this Hawthorne? This vessel is the registered property of Captain Alex Hawthorne.

356
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:04,150
That's me. I am incapable of accepting orders from anyone other than Captain Alex Hawthorne.

357
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:10,300
Hawthorne was supposed to meet me when I landed. Hawthorne's dead, I'm sorry. Your captain's a red

358
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:18,059
smear under my escape pod. I understand. I will require some time to process this information.

359
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:24,780
Thank you for your patience and for your honesty. I am programmed to take orders exclusively from

360
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:31,099
Captain Hawthorne. If I accept your orders, then you must be Captain Hawthorne. Do you understand?

361
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:39,860
I get it. You need me to be Captain Hawthorne or you can't fly. Dumb, nod, and smile. Yes.

362
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:46,420
Excellent. Welcome back Captain Hawthorne. Unfortunately, our engine is currently

363
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:51,539
inoperable. Our main drive suffered a critical power failure and we were forced to make an

364
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:56,659
emergency landing. Oh no. The main drive's power regulator has been irreparably damaged

365
00:55:56,659 --> 00:56:02,940
and must be replaced. Where am I supposed to find something like that? I doubt I'll find a part like

366
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:13,820
that just sitting in a garage. How could you be a dumb engineer? That kind of doesn't make any sense.

367
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:24,599
Astutely observed. However, the probability of locating a power regulator within a worker

368
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,559
settlement falls within acceptable parameters. Have you ever played man versus machine, Jeremy?

369
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:34,199
Power regulators are sometimes employed in the electrical networks of worker settlements.

370
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,159
I have taken the liberty of printing you a new captain's identity cartridge.

371
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,519
Please try not to lose it this time. Thanks. This cartridge identifies you,

372
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:50,599
Alex Hawthorne, as the registered proprietor and captain of the unreliable. Do you understand?

373
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:59,159
Yeah. Captain Hawthorne of the unreliable. I like it. Knock it off with this Captain Hawthorne nonsense.

374
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,519
No, I like it. Thank you. I appreciate your cooperation.

375
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:07,960
Best of luck in your search for a power regulator. Try to stay alive this time.

376
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:22,949
Too bad. Congratulations, you've gained enough experience to go on a level up.

377
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:28,389
Character ledger to advance your character. Health points, points to upgrade your skills,

378
00:57:28,389 --> 00:57:33,190
you get access to new perks, keep leveling up in your build, upper management in no time.

379
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:40,789
All right, let's see. Skill improvements. Every time you level up, yeah, yeah, yeah,

380
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:45,750
you improve your skills. Spending a skill point on a core skill improves all the specialized skills

381
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:51,929
in that group up to a maximum of 50. After 50, you can add points directly to specialized skills up

382
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:58,360
to 100. Okay. So you can do core skills. That's interesting. Every skill improves as it grows,

383
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,679
but special unlock bonuses occur every 20 points. Read each skill description to see what they are.

384
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,519
Cool. These things, these things, and these things can temporarily raise and lower your skills. This

385
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:15,239
helps or hurts skill checks and the skills passive bonuses, but won't give or take away the skill

386
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:24,250
unlocks. Whatever you say. All right. 10 points available. So we're gonna, holy shit, that's a

387
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:38,860
lot of points. Handguns. Welcome to perk selection. You can choose which perks to buy with your perk

388
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:44,550
points. You get a new perk point every two levels. Yeah, perks are cool and they affect gameplay.

389
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:58,780
Oh man. All right. 20% sprint speed, vendor prices, base health. Oh, that's a lot.

390
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,179
Fast travel win in Cumber. That's huge. I feel like that's a big deal.

391
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:21,579
Base armor rating, 20, 25% weapon armor durability loss, companion crit chance.

392
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:28,380
I'm just gonna, let's play it safe. I'm just gonna do, I'm gonna do like speed or health.

393
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:40,090
I'm gonna say health. Yeah. I mean, 50% base health. You can't go wrong there. Yeah, that's good.

394
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:53,820
Skills. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go back. No, no, I did. I wanted to do that. Right.

395
00:59:53,820 --> 01:00:03,829
Okay. You have to actually just click on these 31, up to 50. Dialogue. I want to do that. Let's

396
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:24,300
make sure we have 30 lying and 30 intimidate. Handguns. Yeah. I want to fuck it. Yeah. Fuck it.

397
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:32,329
Let's go. You've unlocked location hit effects for tactical time dilation. Hitting enemies in

398
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:36,809
different locations during TTT maims or cripples those body parts. Try different locations. See

399
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:41,480
what different effects happen. Hits to the chest produce different effects when using different

400
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:47,880
weapons. Okay. Cool. You unlocked the dialogue combat skill. When attacking the correct type

401
01:00:47,880 --> 01:01:02,019
of target, they are automatically debilitated. Dialogue combat. All right. All right. I'm ready.

402
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:24,659
Go find a part. I'll be with you, friend. I'm Ernie. I was about to headshot him.

403
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:30,179
Spacer's Choice Department of Human Resources. Town sent me hereabouts to check on the guards.

404
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:36,340
Oh, the guards. Now, it seems to me, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but it seems to me,

405
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:44,920
they're all dead. Mind telling me what happened here? Uh, the guards? Yeah, the guards and I had

406
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:50,489
a bit of an altercation, you see. The guards accidentally brutally shot themselves while on

407
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:55,449
patrol. I don't like your tell. Yeah, they accidentally brutally shot themselves.

408
01:01:55,449 --> 01:02:01,369
Accidentally brutally shot themselves, huh? Unbelievable. Second time this month. Guess

409
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:05,849
I'd better get to cleaning up. Can't just leave company properties scattered about,

410
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:12,090
bleeding out on the dirt. Good. Okay. I could use their gear. No sense in letting a good suit of

411
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:26,409
armor go to waste. Good idea. And clean up this ship while you're at it. Clean up this ship, too.

412
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,969
Is that an official Spacer's Choice spacecraft on an official Spacer's Choice landing pad?

413
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:38,329
Do I look like an auto-mechanical sanitation unit? The answer to both questions is no. No.

414
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:41,849
You don't want to amble on over to Edgewater at your earliest convenience.

415
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:48,090
Constable's office might have work for someone with your, uh, let's just say aggressive disposition.

416
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:53,849
Oh, and, uh, be sure to stop by the Edgewater Provisioner for a can of salt tuna.

417
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:56,730
It's not the best choice. It's Spacer's Choice.

418
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,519
Hang on, I want to ask you something.

419
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,440
Everybody that streamed this game said, everybody that's, I'm going to say this,

420
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,320
if you've seen this playthrough like probably 10 times at this point, I do.

421
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:21,940
I did, you probably heard that joke like 10 times now. You had to have heard that already.

422
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:25,300
This is just like a, I'm just going through like those, that's just easy.

423
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:58,840
No, I can't. I can't. I can't do it. I can't kill everybody.

424
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:06,280
But even scare everybody. This guy's not even scared. We're good.

425
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:25,980
All right, let's go. You killed everybody in Darkwood. I did not kill everyone in Darkwood.

426
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:42,539
I killed like three NPCs, two maybe, one on accident. I like that. Okay. Is there like a

427
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:47,820
big revolver in this game? Tell me if there's like a big one-handed revolver. If there's not,

428
01:04:47,820 --> 01:05:13,739
I'm going to uninstall it again. Wait, I thought that just said town leader. I can't,

429
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:23,480
the game's not hard. I can't fuck around. But when I shot that guy in the head, I heard like,

430
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:33,079
uh, no, I thought as a town leader, I don't know why red health bar means bad.

431
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:44,059
I got, can I go this way? I mean, we have to take the unorthodox way every time.

432
01:05:48,780 --> 01:06:09,849
That's pretty. This is really cool looking. All right. So this is edge water is the town.

433
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:23,860
What is this thing? Oh, NPCs, coffin. That's kind of weird what I'm doing. All right. Um,

434
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:40,460
corporate trooper, corporate recruit, and then Silas. Hi, Silas. A pod crashed in the hills back

435
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:45,659
there. How do you know I'm not a marauder? You talk too pretty for a marauder. Most of them just

436
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:51,340
grunt and yell. Ain't safe out here. You'd best head into town, avail yourself of Edgewater's

437
01:06:51,340 --> 01:07:01,929
high walls and low, low prices. I never got your name. I'm Junko. Nice to meet you. I'm Alex

438
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:08,099
Hawthorne, captain of the unreliable. What is taking on an identity? Pleased to make your

439
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:13,300
acquaintanceship. I'd shake your hand, but I've been hauling corpses. You don't want none of that.

440
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:20,019
Identity theft from day one for the town of Edgewater. We're all part of the spaces choice

441
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:31,400
family. Who do I talk to about power regulator? I'm looking to make a little money. Junior in

442
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:49,940
humor, like a comedian. What's wrong with my character? My character, it just snaps into

443
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:55,460
being an idiot. Sometimes I'm lying to people and taking identities and introducing myself

444
01:07:55,460 --> 01:08:02,099
as other characters and being like really high IQ type shit. And then I'm just like the junior in

445
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:14,280
comedy. I understood the switch is just flipping every like other conversation. I need a junior

446
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:24,600
in humor. That's for sure. You're pretending to be dumb. It's just you. No, it's pretending to be

447
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:30,520
dumb. Look, you obviously ain't a worker. What's your racket? You a smuggler, freelancer?

448
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:37,210
Ah, it depends on the work. You offer me a job. You offer me a job?

449
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:07,130
You're making people pay for their own graves. You want me to collect what's owed to you?

450
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:13,319
You make people pay for their own grave company policy. It was up to me. I'd put the whole town

451
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:22,659
10 feet under free of charge. Well, that's fucked up. What a psycho. I'm the psycho. Quotas mostly

452
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:30,810
got a backlog of graves to fill. Bodies won't bury themselves, you know. Um, I'll do it.

453
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:38,489
Four workers still haven't paid up Phyllis Conrad and Martin Abernathy. He's a special case.

454
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:46,170
You may want to twist his arm a little. Okay. Why? He just is. Look, I don't want to get into it.

455
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:57,000
Just make sure he pays up. Okay. Uh, I'll be back. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click,

456
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:04,340
click, click. Oh, LML. The quest tracker displays objectives for the active quest you can. All right.

457
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:16,420
All right. So we have some people. I think this is in the town, right? All right. Town. All right.

458
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:23,859
Town leader. That's where I got confused. This was hovering over his head that I shot in the head

459
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:44,729
and I thought it was his name. That makes, okay. Now I get it. Edgewater discovered.

460
01:10:44,729 --> 01:10:53,300
All right. We're looking for, uh, some people in town. Keep your distance, friend. Sick houses.

461
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:08,279
Who's in here? Who am I looking for? I appreciate the company and all,

462
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:17,029
but you really ought to leave. You don't want to be seen around me. Why? Because I'm sick. You

463
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:22,470
don't want to associate with people in the sick house. We're not worth your time. I'm in about as

464
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:28,229
much trouble as I can be. No reason. You ought to be tarnished by association. People are going to

465
01:11:28,229 --> 01:11:38,340
talk. I don't give a shit. What am I being watched? The walls talk is all we all got sights on each

466
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:44,920
other. Any of us breaks company protocol. Boss is going to hear about it from six different mouths.

467
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,079
You think I care about the boss? Maybe you don't know this, but there's a real simple reason you

468
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:56,779
don't talk to the plagued. You don't want what we've got. Where you get the plague. Medical and dumb.

469
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:06,380
You should get really drunk. Alcohol kills germs. I, I'm not allowed to leave the sick house.

470
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:15,300
Even if I were, I shouldn't be at the Quintina. What a shitty diagnosis.

471
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:25,300
Wait, I could be like a really stupid doctor. I like that. That's fun to me. I didn't know that

472
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:32,060
that was possible. I'm not allowed to leave. What do you mean not allowed to leave? I don't want to

473
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:37,899
spread what I've got, and I don't want to bring their spirits down. I'll bring it. Company always

474
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:44,140
tells us weak spirits lead to weak bodies. If I didn't want to fall sick with plague,

475
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:48,140
maybe I should have worked harder. Maybe I should have taken more pride in my work.

476
01:12:52,489 --> 01:12:55,609
That's ridiculous. You can't blame yourself because you get, you got sick again. What's that?

477
01:12:55,609 --> 01:13:00,810
I really wish you wouldn't say those sorts of things. I told you once already. People could be

478
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:05,289
listening. And I'm holding the gun. I'm feeling a touch faint. I've got 38 points in hand. I'd

479
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:10,619
like to be alone for a spell. Don't you know my points? Can you see my points?

480
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:25,420
Sorry, I'm like a snake, guys. Don't do quick, fast movements in front of me. I will strike.

481
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:38,340
Wait, is this stealing? Oh yeah, I'm not, no, I'm not gonna steal.

482
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:44,010
These people are like sick. There's gonna be somebody in here that I need to collect from,

483
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:54,500
right? That's sick. No, I'm not taking anything. What the hell is going on out here?

484
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:11,670
Who's firing? What the fuck are you shooting at? Is it the rats coming out and this person's

485
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:20,409
freaking out? All right, so is there anybody else in here? What's this? Mechanical sentry. This is

486
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:35,779
not stealing, right? How is this not stealing? This is not stealing? This is not stealing. How?

487
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:50,819
Steel dehydrated water tablets. All right, let's keep going. Who's in here?

488
01:14:51,220 --> 01:15:05,670
That's it? Nobody? All right, I'm gonna just keep going. I would assume somebody was in here

489
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:12,279
that I need to talk to. All right, let's go. Is there, it's a map, right? So there is somebody

490
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:18,539
in here. Well, that's the objective. No, no, no, there's nobody in here. Barbershop.

491
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:39,510
Why are you coming after me? What did I do? Something's not right. Why do you have your gun

492
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:52,779
up and just crawling at me? Nothing there. Okay, now let's go. Uh, I, resident. Resident.

493
01:15:56,819 --> 01:16:02,680
This indicator is kind of freaking me out. Where is this person supposed to be?

494
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:14,229
There's four people in here. Workbench discovered. Oh, use terminal. When life gives you lemons,

495
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:20,890
consider it a free trial from your friends at Spacer's Choice. Sure. Maintenance division.

496
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:27,449
There are currently three open trouble tickets. Selected option. Trouble ticket? I can't do this

497
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:34,710
stuff. Failure of main canary production line at heat processing. Open. Start up production line.

498
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:40,789
Smoke, smell of burning. Saliva overheat. Klaxon. Uh, I'm not doing maintenance on your computer.

499
01:16:40,789 --> 01:16:57,800
But I am looking for people. You guys really, really don't like rats.

500
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:25,430
Holy shit. This is super rat. It's shooting people. My God. That's the, the, the, the, the,

501
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:37,899
the disease is from the rats. All right. Um, I still need to track down people that owe money.

502
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:40,729
These people are distracting me.

503
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:55,430
Anybody hiding back here? Is it this D? Wait, hold on. No.

504
01:17:58,569 --> 01:18:01,930
See that little indicator, the circle. What is that trying to show me?

505
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:15,210
Is it this person right here? Is it this guard? Select the quest. I have to switch quests. Oh,

506
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:21,829
how do I do that? Hey, you hear about Wilson? Cause I can't, I can't interact.

507
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:32,789
Just between us. Yeah, there we go. Okay. So I'm tracking it now. Wilson deserted. Lost his nerve.

508
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:38,630
Ran off in the thick of night. You're kidding me. Damn. You can only track one quest at a time.

509
01:18:39,829 --> 01:18:43,510
I think he was playing. Well, guess he didn't want to die. So what's not this person? All right.

510
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:54,789
Friend of mine died a couple of weeks back. Yes, Mr. Thompson. I'm fine, Mr. Thompson. Wait,

511
01:18:54,789 --> 01:19:01,430
this is the one that he warned me about. Well, uh, did, uh, did Mr. Thompson send you?

512
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:07,510
You told Mr. Thompson, I'll be right at my post tomorrow. Uh, bright and early tomorrow

513
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:13,350
because I'm definitely not plagued. His spry is a spring chicken. That's old Abernathy.

514
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:18,949
The white dot is your crosshair. That's not, uh, take it easy. Mr. Thompson didn't send me. I

515
01:19:18,949 --> 01:19:22,949
heard you muttering to yourself. You want to tell me what's got you so nervous.

516
01:19:23,909 --> 01:19:28,710
He's some sort of wandering alienist walking into a man's own domicile,

517
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:36,380
pestering him about his mental state. Uh, so you're Martin Abernathy. I'm here to collect

518
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:40,060
your grave site fees. I'm positive you mentioned something about being plagued.

519
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,960
Let's just, I'm going to cut the bullshit here. I'm here to collect your fee. Silas knows,

520
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:54,300
doesn't he? That's why he sent you. That's why he wants me to pay up. He knows. Yeah. He told me

521
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:58,300
everything. How long do you think you could keep it a secret? I mean, seriously, sounds like he's

522
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:06,300
already told you may as well hear it from me. I'm dying. I'm not long for this world. The date of

523
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:12,699
my expiration is fast approaching. And soon I shall be ushered through the great cannery in the

524
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:20,859
skies. It's plague has to be Silas knows. He knows I got one foot in my grave and now he wants to

525
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:29,909
charge me for the other one. I'm sorry to hear that you're being paranoid. I'm sure it's all

526
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:40,579
very tragic and heartbreaking. Pay me so I can get out of here. That's so, that's so rude,

527
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:54,869
but would a dumb doctor gunslinger that took one class of engineering before he dropped out of

528
01:20:54,869 --> 01:21:11,529
college say this? I don't think so. Sorry to hear that. You are? Oh, wow. First time anyone's ever

529
01:21:11,529 --> 01:21:17,989
told me that. I'll pay your fees. I don't want any trouble from Silas. But if you could see

530
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:27,500
your way to freelancing for me, I could really use the help. Depends on what you need. Couple

531
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:34,539
hours out of your day and some light second story work. That's all. There's a cache of anthracillin

532
01:21:34,539 --> 01:21:40,300
tucked away in the old community center. Powerful stuff. Stronger than what we got. I'm a doctor.

533
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:48,979
I need you to break in. Nab that medicine and bring it back to me. But thievery is something

534
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:53,939
that I am absolutely for in these games. You oblige me with your haste. I think I feel the

535
01:21:53,939 --> 01:22:05,029
plague spreading. Oh law, it's in my spleen now. I can feel it. Just keep your head down when you're

536
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:14,550
in there. Marauders have taken over. We're tracking mud all over the archives. You're taking an awful

537
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:19,510
risk trusting me, you know. I could just flip. If the Marauders offer me triple what they're asking,

538
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:25,590
what you're paying me. I'm just gonna, you know, I'm giving you up. I know that, but I got nobody

539
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:31,430
else to turn to. Reed would have wrote me up. Constable would have locked me up and wrote me up.

540
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:38,149
Could have gone to see the good vicar, but I never did find my courage. Marauders don't make deals?

541
01:22:39,109 --> 01:22:48,170
Well, then that's on them. You don't want to make a deal with me? Fine. You know how that goes.

542
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:55,539
All right, we got another little quest here. Let's go over here to the barber shop.

543
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:07,000
I see you're also a doctor, a medical profession. Please don't touch anything. Your hands are

544
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:14,520
probably crawling with germs. Okay. Physical hygiene recapitulates moral hygiene. Cleanliness

545
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:23,579
is next to lawfulness. I can show you my hands. Listening to you makes my head hurt.

546
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:37,180
An intimidating, dumb doctor that is a pathological liar. I like this character.

547
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:44,220
Uh, I could show you my hands. Look, here they are. No, thank you. That's quite all right.

548
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,420
I've seen enough body parts in my line of work. We're both doctors. I'm Conrad.

549
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:53,739
You will report to me if your hair fails to meet spacer's choice aesthetic standards.

550
01:23:54,699 --> 01:23:57,979
You will also report to me in the event of your death,

551
01:23:57,979 --> 01:24:01,020
whereupon I will clean and prepare your remains for interment.

552
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:13,989
Uh, payoff. Ah, gravesite fees. Silas and I had talked about this at length. I thought I'd made

553
01:24:13,989 --> 01:24:20,949
it clear my pecuniary situation precludes the necessary restitutions. Uh, I don't understand a

554
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:28,310
word you said. I mean that I can't possibly pay my gravesite fees. I simply cannot afford it.

555
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:35,109
I am a blemish on the prosperity of our fair settlement. When I expire, I expect Silas to

556
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:45,619
toss my body into a ditch. I just sneezed. I don't care. Pay up. Uh, you have a very loose

557
01:24:45,619 --> 01:24:52,199
definition of the word prosperity. That's some quality drama, Conrad. You should audition. Don't

558
01:24:52,199 --> 01:25:03,609
be so hard on yourself. That's quality. Thank you. No, I despise the cereals. Tell Silas I can't

559
01:25:03,609 --> 01:25:09,529
afford to pay and that I fully expect to have my medical rights revoked for this dereliction

560
01:25:09,529 --> 01:25:19,640
with my apologies. Hmm. Hang on. Medical rights? Just give Silas an IOU. Forehead.

561
01:25:20,859 --> 01:25:25,180
Hang on. What medical rights? Some time ago I fell ill with the plague. Did everybody have the plague?

562
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:29,579
By the grace of the law and through my own hard work, I'd proven worthy of treatment.

563
01:25:30,619 --> 01:25:35,579
Frankly, I don't imagine I'll earn that right a second time. The barber work hasn't been

564
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:39,420
profitable, you see. I've had to keep this old place running with my own savings.

565
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:49,380
Not a bad idea, but I'd need some kind of collateral. My pair of lucky clippers.

566
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:54,659
No, that won't do. Yes, it will. Where are they? Your idea intrigues me, but I'm afraid I don't

567
01:25:54,659 --> 01:26:01,720
have anything to give Silas. I'm open to suggestions. I'll let you know if I can think of anything.

568
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:13,850
Much obliged. Hmm. Okay. Are those them? Well, I'll trade you. You just take this.

569
01:26:14,489 --> 01:26:32,090
Let's go check on the other one. Somebody's outside. Is it the guard? Shoot, head, rake his organs

570
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:48,470
in. Wait. It is the guard. So I have to collect from you? Fancy threads. Some kind of hibernation

571
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:58,390
suit. Wait. This is the guy I have to come collect from you. Hey, you know that money that you were

572
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:09,109
looking for? I needed from you. Give it to me. See you around. Wait. Yeah. We're talking about

573
01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:21,289
collateral. No. Fuck off. Dude, I should just click, click, click. You know what I mean? But I'm not

574
01:27:21,289 --> 01:27:36,600
going to. Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot. Just kill them after you do their quest.

575
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:45,880
No, I'm not just going to ruin everything. Yeah, sure. Oh, just to shoot the barber in the fucking

576
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:58,460
head. That's going to ruin the rest of the whole game. There's the canary. I almost just

577
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:09,800
accidentally fired the gun. What's in the canary? Let's take a look at the logs. The Edgewater

578
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:14,680
Saltuna canning facility strictly adheres to Spacer's Choice standards of health and safety.

579
01:28:15,319 --> 01:28:19,079
Schedule your sick leave with your Spacer's Choice foreman and or supervisor.

580
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:33,829
Am I just using the computer or whoops? Dehydrated water tablets? No, I'm no, no.

581
01:28:43,189 --> 01:28:43,909
Money.

582
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:52,250
I'm guessing you're the foreman. Grave site fees I'm here to collect.

583
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:59,289
Shit, Silas still on about that. Here, take the fees. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell Reid I

584
01:28:59,289 --> 01:29:04,359
was late on my payment. I'm gonna tell him. These papers aren't signed in your name.

585
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:10,279
Because they're not my fees and not my grave site. Guy I worked with shot himself. I paid the bill.

586
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:18,869
Yeah, that's kind of you, I guess. I could do without the sarcasm. Wasn't acting out of the

587
01:29:18,869 --> 01:29:24,310
goodness of my heart. Law requires delinquent grave site fees to be paid by the deceased party's

588
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:30,149
closest living relative, which meant me. Shame though. Eugene was a good worker.

589
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:35,819
He said they shot him. Woke up one morning and put around through his upper story.

590
01:29:35,819 --> 01:29:39,899
Can't imagine why. Is this a murderer? The kid was doing all right at his desk. We all thought he

591
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:45,260
was an upstanding receptionist. Just between the two of us. I'm pretty shocked his weapon didn't

592
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:55,079
misfire. Spacer's Choice handguns aren't the most reliable. That must be tough. Eugene wasn't family.

593
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:03,270
I thought you said that you were his closest living relative. Yeah, I was the closest living

594
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:08,710
person relative to his body at time of death. I'm the one who found him, you see. So I pay the fines.

595
01:30:09,829 --> 01:30:14,229
Suicide's a crime. What? The legal term is irreparable damage to company property.

596
01:30:14,789 --> 01:30:23,210
What Eugene did to himself was vandalism. What? That's fucking ridiculous. What are they going

597
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:29,909
to do? Arrest his corpse? You can't be serious. You can't be serious. I'm plenty serious. In fact,

598
01:30:29,909 --> 01:30:34,789
I'm a little upset Eugene didn't think things through. In other words, Edgewater would have

599
01:30:34,789 --> 01:30:39,989
been penalized pretty hard. Whatever Eugene was worth as an asset, we would have had to pay out

600
01:30:39,989 --> 01:30:50,090
of pocket to Spacer's Choice. Would have? You didn't? He was a person, not an asset. Well,

601
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:55,369
excuse you. I'll have you know Eugene was an asset to us all. May his atoms be commended to the law.

602
01:30:56,329 --> 01:31:01,779
All I know is Silas asked me for Eugene's gravesite fees, which means he was approved for burial,

603
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:06,739
which means his papers went through, which means the town's in the clear. I'm just glad to put this

604
01:31:06,739 --> 01:31:12,180
whole ugly affair behind me. Eugene can rest his bones in peace and the rest of us can get on with

605
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:24,090
our own lives. Eugene wasn't a guard, right? Because there was a couple of, one of the guards

606
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:40,470
brutally accidentally shot themselves earlier. Okay, I don't think so. Okay, I'll get back to you.

607
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:56,020
I'll let you get back to work. Thanks for the money. Decipher the code. What is it? This

608
01:31:56,020 --> 01:32:07,739
computer. Personal files. Hack five. I'm a hacker too? Password tenderfoot. Password accepted.

609
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:15,220
Welcome. Personal files. Theodore buried last night. Reed asked me not to report his death in

610
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:20,260
our quarterlies. Sounds fair to me. Was asked to prepare a statement or something for the

611
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:23,779
other workers. Been thinking about it. Don't know what to tell them. Don't end up like Theodore. Do

612
01:32:23,779 --> 01:32:33,460
your work. Show up. Wear a smile and you'll get your medical privileges. Is a start. I knew it.

613
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:46,420
It was a fucking murder. This was a murder. What's on your mind? I paid his burial fees,

614
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:51,300
didn't I? Let the dead sleep. No way. The person's name is Eugene. Never mind. Sorry.

615
01:32:52,260 --> 01:33:06,100
Sorry for the immediate accusation. I don't even know the person's name. And I'm about to

616
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:12,899
you killed Theodore, you shot him with your own gun, and then you paid for it. The person's name

617
01:33:12,899 --> 01:33:33,109
was Theodore. Not Eugene. Oh, sorry. Let's get the other money. Do people get annoyed if you

618
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:46,359
guys shoot a gun? If I just go like, all righty, I know what you what what collateral you put in

619
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:54,600
the back room or something? What is this? Letter from Phyllis. Conrad receptionist shot himself.

620
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,680
This is bad. Company's going to have to call it for what it is. Destruction of spacer's choice

621
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:03,720
property. Eugene was an asset and somebody has to pay his body price. This is going to ruin us.

622
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:08,199
So I was thinking that we pawn off his teeth. Eugene had a full set of gold teeth.

623
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:13,079
Heirlooms passed down his family or something. You're processing his body, right? Just stick

624
01:34:13,079 --> 01:34:17,399
around and pry them out. We sell the teeth somewhere nice and quiet. Use the bits to pay

625
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:21,560
his body price and nobody's the wiser. What do you think? Don't write back. In fact,

626
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,760
don't talk to me at all. Just give me a special signal next time you see me.

627
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:35,340
Waggle your eyebrows. Would you look at that. Conspiracy. Conspiracy to commit to commit

628
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:43,460
teeth fraud. Got you. Where's the body? Light. Oh, wait a minute. What do you have?

629
01:34:44,180 --> 01:35:02,140
What's that? How much DPS do I have? Oh, it's the same gun. Okay, so the buried without the teeth.

630
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:14,579
I got my eye on you. You're gonna owe a lot more than like 30 bucks. Oh, shit. I didn't mean to do

631
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:26,470
that. Okay, so you can't don't aim guns at people's heads. Got it. So the long tomorrow.

632
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:36,699
All right, a small grave matter. So with Ludwig, he's stationed as a guard at the landing pad

633
01:35:36,699 --> 01:35:50,789
southeast of Edgewater. Okay. But I want to go to like the graveyard. Talk to Conrad. Should I though?

634
01:35:50,789 --> 01:35:55,340
I feel like I shouldn't. I feel like that's not going to work. What can I do for you?

635
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:05,479
Oh, I'm not medical smart enough. I know about Eugene. Why not use his teeth as collateral

636
01:36:05,479 --> 01:36:19,079
free gravesite fees? You know about Eugene. How? I don't know. Were you snooping around in my things?

637
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:26,199
Or was it just dumb luck? Eugene's golden teeth were a family heirloom representing three

638
01:36:26,199 --> 01:36:32,439
generations of poor dental hygiene. Bullshit. He took them to his grave. Bullshit. No, he didn't.

639
01:36:33,399 --> 01:36:39,859
They I'm sure they were probably worth a few bits. More than a few. Those teeth were his personal

640
01:36:39,859 --> 01:36:47,060
savings. I can't ask Silas to dig up a man's body and pry a few teeth loose from his jaw

641
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:56,710
just to pay my bills. Can I? I don't care. I'm just here to collect your dues.

642
01:36:57,510 --> 01:37:07,340
Uh, yeah. Yes, I suppose I must. Here you are. Gravesite papers are fixed with my signature

643
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:16,939
and an IOU. I'm told he killed himself. What happened? Eugene was not a suicide. He put a

644
01:37:16,939 --> 01:37:22,619
bullet in his brain. Yes, but that's largely a technicality. I was the one who prepared Eugene's

645
01:37:22,619 --> 01:37:28,699
body for interment. I discovered symptoms of the plague on his corpse and I discovered medicine in

646
01:37:28,699 --> 01:37:35,899
his pocket. Lots of medicine. Eugene overdosed on Adrena time, which is known to cause psychosis

647
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:40,699
and paranoia as possible side effects. The paranoia drove him to take his own life.

648
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:51,369
It's a miracle of bureaucracy. If Eugene's death were filed as a suicide, we'd all pay the price

649
01:37:51,369 --> 01:37:57,369
for his crime. We can all thank our lucky stars that young Eugene was hopped up on medication and

650
01:37:57,369 --> 01:38:03,529
suffered its predictable side effect. I included it all in my official report. I'd like to think I

651
01:38:03,529 --> 01:38:08,170
saved Edgewater a great deal of money. We never could have paid the fines associated with a

652
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:13,779
suicide. I was responsible for this. I'm a pretty good liar. I could probably go lie to them and

653
01:38:13,779 --> 01:38:37,449
take care of everything. Thanks for the money. All right, let's go to Ludwig. Capitalism bad.

654
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:45,130
Hungry to roasted turkey dinner good. What are you saying?

655
01:39:01,989 --> 01:39:08,859
All right, Ludwig. This is kind of fun just kind of walking around and investigating and

656
01:39:08,939 --> 01:39:25,590
talking to people. It's really it's doing it for my koala brain. All right, you. Thank the law.

657
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:31,350
I've been repositioning backup for months. Guess the boss finally came to his senses.

658
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:37,189
I just shot all these people. Well, let me see your rifling stance. I want to make sure you're up to

659
01:39:37,189 --> 01:39:45,430
snuff. What do you want? Are you okay? You seem confused. Graveside fees cut to the chase. I told

660
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:48,470
Silas I'd pay my dues if he agreed to join the resistance.

661
01:39:49,829 --> 01:39:57,979
Guess this means he's finally heard the calling. You seem confused. I'm talking about mechanical

662
01:39:57,979 --> 01:40:10,340
soldier cold heartless automatons made of iron and lies. Well, fuck me. Oh, they mean to. Just

663
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:18,739
you wait auto mechanical auto creatures forged in the fires of malevolence.

664
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:25,140
I seen them over by the old power plant clattering about firing at the birds

665
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:32,819
orchestrating their uprising when the swarms of mechanicals come clanging on over that hill.

666
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:40,500
Where will you be cowering beneath your cot or standing shoulder to shoulder with the resistance?

667
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:52,090
What can I do to stop the coming apocalypse? You can gird yourself in the armor of righteousness,

668
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:58,409
soldier. From this moment on, you are a proud member of the resistance.

669
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:04,250
Right, did I just join a reputation around the junkyard just behind our beloved town?

670
01:41:05,289 --> 01:41:08,810
The scout must not be permitted to return to its base of operations.

671
01:41:09,609 --> 01:41:11,770
Cross it off and report back.

672
01:41:17,449 --> 01:41:21,369
Mechanicals got a weak spot in their midsections. I think the technical term is

673
01:41:22,329 --> 01:41:28,250
the blue glowy square thing. And I put my hand up and put it up my mouth and go,

674
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:46,409
All right, so now let's I got a lot of random quests now. All right, I have that. What about

675
01:41:46,409 --> 01:41:53,670
stranger in a strange land? Collect money from a few workers. You need to find a power regulator

676
01:41:53,670 --> 01:42:03,829
die robot. Ludwig Miller. Okay, spotted a forward scout of the mechanical army north of the landing

677
01:42:03,829 --> 01:42:16,199
pad. Let's do it. Let's go do it. I'm ready. There's a volcano in this game.

678
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:25,020
Instant letter grid. Can I play with the lava like in those YouTube videos that you relax to?

679
01:42:25,819 --> 01:42:46,619
It looks like putty, like hot silly putty. Cheese. Hit cartridge. Slaw. And what's this?

680
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:58,970
Kane Van Acker. Spacer's Choice Ethologist. Assigned to Terra 2. This week I've decided to study

681
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:08,100
the terroir mating habits. The female terroir's leave their nesting area in the morning or

682
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:12,340
returning afternoon with random objects, typically something shiny or bright. Then they build displays

683
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:16,739
with these objects and perform what I can only describe as a dance for an audience of males.

684
01:43:16,739 --> 01:43:20,739
If a male likes what it sees, the two go off and nest together in one of the nearby trees.

685
01:43:20,739 --> 01:43:24,420
Gerald, if you're reading this, I'm done waiting for you. Collect my things and meet me at the

686
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:27,460
next site. And don't be late. I expect punctuality from my assistants.

687
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:37,560
There's the assistant. Okay. Wait, why am I, why am I, I'm under attack?

688
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:45,930
How am I, am I under attack? I'm not even under attack. What are these? Oh wait, this is,

689
01:43:45,930 --> 01:44:16,779
these are the birds. Can we just watch them? Uh, I was under attack. I'm sorry, but I was

690
01:44:16,779 --> 01:44:34,420
actually under attack. All right, let's go. So there's a scout over here. Here's the scout.

691
01:44:35,140 --> 01:45:00,039
Should I sneak up on it? Damn it. Hello? Searching for repair bay error. Navigation systems failed.

692
01:45:00,039 --> 01:45:13,369
Unable to comply. I think a good smack won't fix. Navigation systems operational. Optimal

693
01:45:13,369 --> 01:45:21,560
path toward repair bay detected. Initiating self-diagnostics. Whoa, hey, don't you owe me

694
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:28,279
something for the repairs. Spacer's choice reminds all colonists that serving the Spacer's choice

695
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:36,760
family is the highest possible reward. I have been programmed to deliver this pre-approved message.

696
01:45:38,649 --> 01:45:56,869
All right, bye. Well, that was easy. Transmit cartridge. Kill it. No, why do I kill it?

697
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:05,159
Gained its trust. Quest is to kill it. But why, but for what? I need to know why.

698
01:46:07,989 --> 01:46:21,340
I don't just kill people and things for no reason. Got a pretty good shot, though. It's for the robot

699
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:29,029
takeover. You're on, I've joined the resistance. Well, I'm just gonna lie to him. Bring us honor,

700
01:46:29,029 --> 01:46:36,520
soldier. You won't have to worry about that scout anymore. You beat that scout to scrap with its own

701
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:43,340
legs? Pulled its optic cables out its headcase? Actually, don't tell me. Rather use my imagination.

702
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:51,180
You're a passing, fair soldier, I will confess. 857. But you are one, and the enemy is Legion.

703
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:59,020
What you need is a new weapon, a weapon to strike fear in their cold mechanical hearts.

704
01:47:00,739 --> 01:47:08,100
Cantina, lavatory, behind one of the toilets. That's where I've kept it hidden all these years.

705
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:14,819
All right. You hide your secret weapon in a bathroom. Sharp, ain't it? The lavatory is the

706
01:47:14,819 --> 01:47:21,939
very last place a mechanical has need to enter. I mean, it's, it's an accurate statement.

707
01:47:22,819 --> 01:47:27,640
On the double, soldier. Don't want the bartender poking around in there with a mop.

708
01:47:29,479 --> 01:47:45,189
All right, level three. All right, more lying. So at 40, scramble duration plus seven seconds.

709
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:57,380
Coward duration, terrify area of effect, ranged. So what is it? Handguns at 40,

710
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:07,989
handgun critical damage. Oh, absolutely. Plus 50% long guns. All right, I need to start doing some

711
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:18,380
other shit here. Medical, right? 28, should I? Yeah, medical, stupid doctor.

712
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:25,369
Leadership. Yeah, I want to be like a dumb engineer, doctor, scientist.

713
01:48:26,409 --> 01:48:30,569
Three medical, but what is the, in brackets, how is that being affected by something else?

714
01:48:36,979 --> 01:48:56,470
Dumb detective doctor. It's the suit. Peter. All right, I'm going to have 10 medical because I can

715
01:48:56,470 --> 01:49:10,100
use. All right. And then we're going to put the other, maybe I'll just keep doing it, do it again.

716
01:49:11,699 --> 01:49:32,869
Or just do this and then a couple more. All right. Good. Good. Let's do a stupid engineer,

717
01:49:32,869 --> 01:49:47,189
stupid doctor, stupid scientist. That doesn't make any sense. Stupid, fucking idiot, dumb,

718
01:49:47,189 --> 01:49:57,319
fucking idiot, fucking doctor, dumb fucking scientist. All right, we're going to find the

719
01:49:57,319 --> 01:50:11,960
weapon. I hope it's a one-handed weapon. Is it one-handed? The latest report. The part that

720
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:23,260
said we making our quotas. Is this the bathroom? I'm here to use the bathroom. What the fuck?

721
01:50:26,949 --> 01:50:50,920
Find Ludwig's secret weapon. But what is it? Return to Ludwig. I'll be back. Nice ammo. What

722
01:50:50,920 --> 01:51:09,060
do you mean? Do I have low ammo? Oh, fucking idiot scientist. Can't even get over a railing.

723
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:26,420
Give me a break. Nice frame rate. Loser. I have a 1080. Yes, I have, I have a one omega lol.

724
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:32,819
Eight omega lol. Yes. I can't wait to see it. Please spam it. I'd love for you to do it.

725
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:42,579
Bring us honor soldier. Here's the package. Feast your eyes soldier. This here is a genuine

726
01:51:42,659 --> 01:51:49,859
spacers choice injury customizing unit designed to deliver a lethal blast of electrical discharge.

727
01:51:50,659 --> 01:51:57,859
I call it the hand of the law. You ever want to see a mechanical flailing around like a grounded fish?

728
01:51:57,859 --> 01:52:02,500
You stick a couple thousand volts in its guts with compliments from old Ludwig.

729
01:52:04,819 --> 01:52:10,569
All right, so what's next? Time's come for you to journey down into the black heart of the enemy's

730
01:52:10,569 --> 01:52:19,130
camp. I'm talking about the old geothermal plant. Unfortunately, the old plant lies

731
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:25,369
outside my board given jurisdiction. You'll need to get a passcode from the boss, Reid Thompson.

732
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:33,590
I get it. You want me to go undercover as a mechanical and learn their ways.

733
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:40,710
You got plucked kid. But no, can't risk having you go native. I need you to get us the brain of a

734
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:47,109
mechanical. Well, not exactly a brain. Logic module. Anatomically speaking, what we're looking for

735
01:52:47,109 --> 01:52:59,479
is a logic module. If a mechanical breaks down, the logic module fries so you can't rip one out

736
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:07,880
of its corpse. You're gonna have to find an intact model somehow. Seems simple enough. If you die

737
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:17,399
horribly, I will pour out a can of zero G to your memory. Okay, you've gotten a weapon

738
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:21,720
modification install mods at a workbench to upgrade your weapons, changing damage type,

739
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:28,470
adding a scope, improving rate of fire and more. Cool. All right, well, I'm gonna I'm gonna pee.

740
01:53:28,470 --> 01:55:44,310
So I'll be right back in about two minutes. See you in a sec. Something interesting to note is my

741
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:53,670
character is very stupid. So he's only done the first tutorial story mission. I've just been

742
01:55:53,670 --> 01:56:00,300
walking around looking at stuff and doing side quests for an hour. It's kind of realizing that

743
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:14,949
now. All right. Uh, so what are what objective are we on right now? Die robots speak with Reid.

744
01:56:15,670 --> 01:56:20,439
Ludwig wants you to head to the region's geothermal plant for an important mission,

745
01:56:20,439 --> 01:56:24,520
but to gain entry to the plant, you need to get the passcode from Reid Thompson,

746
01:56:25,079 --> 01:56:33,289
who runs the town of Edgewater. I also have to return to Silas. Let's do that first.

747
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:56,060
I bet your piss is cold. I think that doesn't that mean I'm dead? That means I'm not alive.

748
01:56:57,020 --> 01:57:07,079
That makes no sense. Cold pee. I mean, maybe if you like pissed into the air at like,

749
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:16,420
minus 40 degrees outside, maybe grave digging is a fine profession. Always work to be had

750
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:23,979
and nary a word of complaint out of your clients. We need to talk about Eugene.

751
01:57:24,859 --> 01:57:36,869
Yeah. What about him? You first. I know you buried him. Hmm. Well, yeah, it's what I'm contractually

752
01:57:36,869 --> 01:57:45,689
obligated to do. What's this about? Open your mouth. Let me see your teeth. He's got solid gold teeth

753
01:57:45,689 --> 01:57:52,069
could be worse up than if you pulled him out. Yeah. Funny thing. Eugene's body ain't where it's

754
01:57:52,069 --> 01:57:56,149
supposed to be. That's hilarious. We were supposed to commend his body to the earth. I had his grave

755
01:57:56,149 --> 01:58:01,909
all dug up and ready. Right. And so I thought I'll just rest my eyes a bit. When I woke up,

756
01:58:01,909 --> 01:58:09,109
his body was gone. Life spirited away, vanished. The footprints nearby suggested that Eugene was

757
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:19,750
stolen by marauders or he rose from the dead. Okay. Let me know if you find anything about those

758
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:27,109
fees. You run into any trouble? I'm all done paperwork fees and signatures. Reliable work

759
01:58:27,109 --> 01:58:36,260
from a freelancer. That's going to take some getting used to. I don't want to be bothered

760
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:42,220
here, but I went, I went out of my way for this and I'll buy you a drink sometime.

761
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:52,539
Uh, I was hoping you'd give me like something. I kind of want you the helmet. What?

762
01:58:53,939 --> 01:58:57,699
You've lost Abernathy's grave. Oh, okay. I was going to say that I fucked something up.

763
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:03,380
Uh, something more tangible. Suppose you've earned it. One good turn deserves another.

764
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:10,199
Yeah. I want more than that as I'm counting the money. Oh, Abernathy was trying to hide his

765
01:59:10,199 --> 01:59:17,640
illness. Am I a tattletale? Yeah. Abernathy was sick with the plague. That's disgusting.

766
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:27,460
I shook hands with the guy. He was convinced that you knew. What? No, if I knew he was sick,

767
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:34,020
I would have had him reported. I needed his fees because of his name. Hey, for Abernathy. He was

768
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:46,739
at the top of my list. You see, I think I just sentenced that guy to death. Uh, yeah. Okay,

769
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:52,979
I should go. Your reputation with the faction has changed. If enemies are hostile, but your

770
01:59:52,979 --> 01:59:58,279
reputation isn't kill on sight, leaving for a few days will calm things down. Okay.

771
01:59:59,319 --> 02:00:10,710
Let's keep going. So now I'm going to do die robot. Is the cash medicine completed? Okay. Let's do

772
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:25,109
this botched. You can botch missions. All right. Speak with Reed. Let's do that. Save game. Oh,

773
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:28,149
I guess if you like shoot that guy in the head, when you first talk to him, you're not going to

774
02:00:28,229 --> 02:00:58,039
do his mission. All right. Up in the top edge water. Uh, 10,000 bits just came in. That was

775
02:00:58,039 --> 02:01:11,539
a 10,000 from a turtle duck. That's a $100 bit drop. Thank you. Turtleduck. That's massive bits.

776
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:17,479
Let's see. What do you say here? Hey, German, watching your streams and videos for many years.

777
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:20,840
Your content is, and has been helping me get through some real tough times of dealing with

778
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:24,760
depression and anxiety. Even when everything seems like crap, your streams never failed to

779
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:29,560
make me laugh. I'm finally on the path to getting better. So I just wanted to give something back

780
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:34,199
and thank you for bringing joy to all of us. That's I'm really great. That's awesome to hear

781
02:01:34,199 --> 02:01:38,359
that you're starting to get better. That's the most important thing in this whole message here.

782
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:53,159
That's great news. Thank you so much for the $100. It's never necessary to do that.

783
02:01:54,039 --> 02:02:08,520
I appreciate it. Nonetheless, I wish you happy days and happy health. Thank you so much for your

784
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:17,399
insanely huge amount of monetary contributions that you just dropped. But what about the nighttime?

785
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:30,569
That too. All right. Where am I going? This music sounds like breaking bad.

786
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:43,770
Yeah, it does. That's insanely accurate. How do I get up to the, I need to go up in like an elevator

787
02:02:43,770 --> 02:03:00,539
or something. Is there an elevator down here? Down the level? Jesse. No, this one right here.

788
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:19,590
Look at the map. Look at the map, Jesse. Grease monkey, Argo. I'm sorry, Mr. Thompson, sir.

789
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:25,989
You asked why it's taking so long to fix. The answer's technical. Don't apologize. Just

790
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:32,470
try using small words. Seems we've got a guest. Hi. Really now Parvati, I do wish you'd spoken up.

791
02:03:33,189 --> 02:03:39,189
I do apologize. I was given no forewarning of your arrival. Look at those motocross gloves.

792
02:03:41,029 --> 02:03:44,630
Are you Reed? I was told I should talk to you. You must be the town boss. I'll wait until you

793
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:50,890
finish that. You were saying Miss Holcomb. It's just what Bess needs is a proper refurbish.

794
02:03:51,449 --> 02:03:59,210
I can bandage her up and what all, but she's just old. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll, I'll do better.

795
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:06,090
And I do wish you'd stop referring to our cannery as Bess. Personification of company property is

796
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:11,850
strictly contrary to the spacer's choice code of conduct. My apologies. I am not in the habit of

797
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:18,729
allowing my guests to witness such a rowl. Now, what can I do for you? Well, you're very clearly

798
02:04:18,729 --> 02:04:29,100
wearing an evil guy hat. I don't trust you because you're wearing this hat. It's that brimmed hat

799
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:34,579
that has the rounded top. If this was a little higher and squared, you'd, you're, you're a

800
02:04:34,579 --> 02:04:38,420
billionaire. You're like an eccentric billionaire, but no, you're a bad guy with this hat on.

801
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:44,859
Uh, I should, that's, I, we can start with introductions. I'm didn't know. I'm not,

802
02:04:44,859 --> 02:04:50,460
that's wrong. Are you Reed? I'm Reed Thompson, outpost administrator. I cannot help but notice

803
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:59,850
you are not in uniform. Shut up. Idiot. Uh, uniform. What are you talking about? Shirt,

804
02:04:59,850 --> 02:05:04,569
pants, work boots, company approved colors. I looked down. I'm just naked. Honorable apparel

805
02:05:04,569 --> 02:05:13,180
of a lawyer worker. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mr. Reed. I didn't realize. Uh, let's skip the small talk.

806
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:19,140
I've got a ship. It needs a power regulator. I think you made the wrong idea. Uh, I, I'll wait.

807
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:26,819
I need my, I need that, but I also need the, yeah, I need a- Only regulator we've got is

808
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:31,619
hooked up to the town transformer. Mr. Thompson ain't liable to be keen on dismantling it.

809
02:05:32,579 --> 02:05:38,579
I beg your pardon. I am most emphatically not keen on any such thing. I can't let you have our

810
02:05:38,579 --> 02:05:45,180
power regulator, but I happen to know of another one and I happen to know exactly how you may

811
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:54,500
retrieve it without frying yourself in the process. Let's hear it. There's a power regulator in the

812
02:05:54,500 --> 02:06:01,460
old botanical lab. It's mostly abandoned. So all that power is being squandered. Go down to the

813
02:06:01,539 --> 02:06:08,340
geothermal plant, reroute power from the botanical district over to us. Once their power shut down,

814
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:16,409
you can have their regulator and be along on your way. Wait, don't I need, I need to go here

815
02:06:16,409 --> 02:06:22,729
anyways. The geothermal plant was built by our owners. Spacer's choice lit up the whole veil

816
02:06:22,729 --> 02:06:28,550
once upon a time. Most of the veil is now abandoned. All that power is going to waste.

817
02:06:31,859 --> 02:06:43,029
Uh, and you want all that power going to your canary. We could use the power. Canary's been

818
02:06:43,029 --> 02:06:48,869
struggling. If we don't ramp up productivity, the company might cut us loose. Interesting. You're

819
02:06:48,869 --> 02:06:57,079
saying the, um, saying it with an English accent. I guess you know the English. Yeah, that makes

820
02:06:57,079 --> 02:07:04,630
sense. Uh, okay. I suppose that's fair. I was not entirely sure how to tell you this. The botanical

821
02:07:04,630 --> 02:07:13,020
labs are not legally inhabited, but there are people who live there. Big subs. Big subs. Uh,

822
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:17,939
Aerosun, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you. Congratulations to all the new subs.

823
02:07:18,579 --> 02:07:25,300
Thanks for the five. Uh, what a surprise. I never would have guessed. I'm not trying to pull one

824
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:31,109
over on you, friend. You were bound to run into them sooner or later. The people living in the

825
02:07:31,109 --> 02:07:38,149
botanical labs, they're deserters, former workers. I need them back at their posts. I need them.

826
02:07:38,550 --> 02:07:46,020
To come home. This book is a liar. If you want me to solve your deserter problems, I charge by the

827
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:53,300
head. No, I don't want you killing anyone. Least of all them. My hope is that by cutting off their

828
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:58,979
power, you will convince those deserters to come back to town before you go to the plant. I want

829
02:07:58,979 --> 02:08:04,659
you to stop by the botanical lab. Oh, you didn't want me to their leader, Adelaide, tell her the

830
02:08:04,659 --> 02:08:09,539
power's about to go and that it's time her band of deserters came back to town. What if they don't

831
02:08:09,539 --> 02:08:16,279
want to come back? How will I recognize Adelaide? Adelaide's older than the other deserters.

832
02:08:16,279 --> 02:08:21,560
She'll have floating text about her player model. From what I understand, her camp looks to her for

833
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:33,300
leadership. They must have left them for a reason. Why'd they go? That reason was me. I asked too much

834
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:38,500
and pushed too hard, but I am ready to make amends if they are willing to return to the fold.

835
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:45,300
We belong to one community, the Spacer's Choice family. If we dissolve into factions, then we

836
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:55,050
will all perish separately. Adelaide will understand that. I can't make any promises. Of course,

837
02:08:55,050 --> 02:08:59,449
I understand completely. Here, let me give you the passcode to the geothermal plant.

838
02:08:59,449 --> 02:09:04,890
A sign of good faith, for so politely listening to me as I ramble on. We got die robot. Are you

839
02:09:04,890 --> 02:09:12,010
setting off for the Vale? Because I know my way around. I mean, in case you want to guide. I mean,

840
02:09:12,010 --> 02:09:18,979
if that's all right with you, Mr. Thompson. Sir. I hesitate to part ways with Miss Holcomb, but I

841
02:09:18,979 --> 02:09:26,010
cannot deny that she is talented and may prove useful to you. Okay, I can use the company. I don't

842
02:09:26,010 --> 02:09:35,779
need help. Uh, it's just a, it's just a person that's just going to walk around with me and

843
02:09:35,779 --> 02:09:43,859
shoot other enemies with me. So why not? Great. I got my wrenches and diagnosticators and hairpins

844
02:09:43,859 --> 02:09:50,420
and engine tape. So I'm all set. Well, I am glad to hear that. Best of luck to you. And thank you

845
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:54,260
again for your help. It is a lot to ask of a stranger. She's just going to be walking around

846
02:09:54,260 --> 02:10:01,539
going like, need ammo. Bang, bang, bang, bang. Watch it. Bang, bang, bang. She's going to take

847
02:10:01,539 --> 02:10:08,439
like nine bullets. That's all it's for. She'll draw like the attack of two or three enemies while I

848
02:10:08,439 --> 02:10:16,100
can shoot them. It's worth having. You've gained a companion. There are characters that join you in

849
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:21,380
your adventures and help in a variety of ways. Combat support. Their skills enhance your skills.

850
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:25,140
They increase your carrying capacity. You can unlock special companion combat abilities with

851
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:32,020
the inspiration skill. Right. Like I said, it's someone to walk around with you and just absorb

852
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:44,090
enemy attacks. Wait, I'm trying to like open his private door. Oops. I thought that was the way

853
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:54,500
out. All right. Now let's, let's go. I got it. Let's go get the logic module. Are you coming with me?

854
02:10:55,060 --> 02:11:01,239
What do you have for skills? How do I check? We better clear out of Mr. Thompson's office

855
02:11:01,239 --> 02:11:08,859
before we talk. I mean, you could have not said that right in front of him. Now he knows we're

856
02:11:08,859 --> 02:11:23,079
going to talk about him. Save the game and shoot. I'm not, why would I do that? My character does

857
02:11:23,079 --> 02:11:31,399
not have any inspiration to do that. We better clear out of Mr. Thompson's office. Are you really

858
02:11:31,399 --> 02:11:41,060
that paranoid? Well, I guess maybe this cameras. Sorry. What? Can we chat? Oops. Companions. I

859
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:47,640
thought you said no. I, you just want to get out of here and you likely don't want to tag along like

860
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:54,600
me. It's just Mr. Thompson has his own view on matters on account of it's his job and what all,

861
02:11:54,600 --> 02:12:04,659
but that's not the only side of the tale. That's just black masking tape over the top. There's

862
02:12:04,659 --> 02:12:08,500
you can't, there's nothing. There's no visual here. You can't see through these. There's a costume.

863
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:18,180
Who's this a costume of? All right. Uh, this is about the deserters. If I wanted to deal with

864
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:29,210
nuance, I wouldn't be this heavily armed. Let's go. She's cosplaying as

865
02:12:31,859 --> 02:12:38,260
Parvati from Outer Worlds. If I want to deal with this, I want to just go do the quest.

866
02:12:39,779 --> 02:12:44,180
I don't really, I don't really want to talk. You're a, you're a companion right now. I'm going to,

867
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:46,979
this is probably going to be another companion in like an hour that I'm going to replace you with.

868
02:12:47,539 --> 02:12:50,899
So I know you're going to tell me your entire story. I don't really want to hear it.

869
02:12:51,460 --> 02:13:02,039
I mean, no, this is Mr. Thompson. The person's a gear. It does its job quiet. Like if it squeaks

870
02:13:02,039 --> 02:13:08,920
or stutters, it gets replaced. The deserters are decent folk. I knew some of them before they left.

871
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:15,939
Okay. This town's got issues. I don't blame him. It's hard here, especially for them that don't fit

872
02:13:15,939 --> 02:13:23,020
in so well. We're one big spacer's choice family, but every family's got the one the rest whisper about

873
02:13:23,979 --> 02:13:29,899
Mr. Thompson's aiming to take away their power. They'll have no lights to see nor heat to cook.

874
02:13:29,899 --> 02:13:35,340
They'll be at the mercy of marauders or worse. I think you should talk to the town's vicar about

875
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:46,840
it. Max, his name is. Okay. I'll think about it. What do we need to talk to the vicar about?

876
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:52,359
Flipping a switch in your power mill. About if what Mr. Thompson proposes to do is upright,

877
02:13:53,079 --> 02:13:59,800
leaving Ms. McDevitt's folk to their fate, their neighbors, Kim. And maybe he can think of something

878
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:06,359
else to try. Something we ain't. He used to go walking outside town. Maybe he found something

879
02:14:06,359 --> 02:14:27,220
that'll help. It's just an idea. That's all. I'll think about it. Should I talk to this person?

880
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:37,220
Comes now the power. Okay. Party wants to visit the town's vicar. She's a little uncertain about

881
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:56,039
the task. Where are they? Where are they? Where's the where's this person? Where are we headed?

882
02:14:56,039 --> 02:14:59,560
Where are they? Tell me where they are. No, we're not going to talk later. I want to talk now

883
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:22,170
in the church. There's a church. Oh, now he wants to talk. Okay. Point of there we go.

884
02:15:22,970 --> 02:15:40,920
So right there. I'm just curious. I'm just curious. I want to know what's going on.

885
02:15:43,060 --> 02:15:51,460
I've always felt weird in here. It's too clean. All right, let's talk. Is it you?

886
02:15:53,590 --> 02:16:02,100
Yes. What is it? You're an outsider. Fantastic. Vicar Maximilian De Soto at your service.

887
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:08,500
Or Vicar Max, if you're the sort who prefers brevity. And Ms. Holcomb as well. How rare to see

888
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:15,220
you out. And with a complete stranger. Curious. Just tagging along. Vicar De Soto.

889
02:16:16,899 --> 02:16:23,619
I so rarely get new people to talk to. Name your poison. Anything at all. Spiritual counseling.

890
02:16:23,619 --> 02:16:27,380
This season's tossball predictions. The quickest way out of town.

891
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:38,360
Pavarti wanted to talk to you about what Reid asked us to do. How do you know I'm an outsider?

892
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:44,569
What sort of spiritual advice do you offer here? They who are not satisfied with their work are

893
02:16:44,649 --> 02:16:52,969
satisfied with nothing. No. How about work fortifies the spirit. True exhaustion awaits

894
02:16:52,969 --> 02:17:03,239
idle hands. I was asking what your religion is. The OSI teaches that the grand architect set a

895
02:17:03,239 --> 02:17:08,840
perfect system in motion at the beginning of time. Contentment is found by accepting one's

896
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:18,200
role in that grand plan. How much to put in a good word for me with the grand architect,

897
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:25,559
unofficial like. That's not how it works. The grand architect has no concern for us beyond

898
02:17:25,559 --> 02:17:34,020
setting the plan in motion. I don't get it. Obviously. Look, if we can figure out how to

899
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:39,860
read the grand plan, we can more perfectly align ourselves to it, bringing everyone peace.

900
02:17:43,459 --> 02:17:47,780
Okay. Well, first there's the matter of dumb. Oh, mega wall. And animal sacrifices.

901
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:51,700
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Don't you know how stupid I am? Why would you say that?

902
02:17:51,700 --> 02:17:56,659
To truly understand the metaphysics involved takes years of study and contemplation.

903
02:17:59,059 --> 02:18:06,790
We've already wanted. Okay. I thought you would talk to him. What you wanted to speak to me,

904
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:11,750
Ms. Holcomb. That's not what every time I've tried to engage you in your doing at the floor,

905
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:17,829
answering single words and slink away. I can't imagine what would be so grave as to drive her

906
02:18:17,829 --> 02:18:30,059
to my mission. What has Mr. Thompson asked you to do? Okay. Why? Where's the, where's go get

907
02:18:30,059 --> 02:18:38,440
groceries? Number four cop power to deserters. If you could answer quickly, we're in a hurry.

908
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:44,629
I can see why that troubles you. His Holcomb has a soft heart.

909
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:54,819
Always has. If you believe the talk, can party get that treated by a saw bones.

910
02:18:56,280 --> 02:19:01,879
I see today we'll be conversing without metaphors. I guess her condition is incurable.

911
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:06,840
It's unlikely to be fatal, but she may feel more heartache than most.

912
02:19:07,799 --> 02:19:10,600
Could you maybe stop talking about me like I'm some kind of weird bug?

913
02:19:11,719 --> 02:19:20,409
Sorry. Oh, right. Can we wrap this up? This two or three people speaking through me.

914
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:27,190
Does she have saw bones? Hey, can we wrap this up that we got weird hurry?

915
02:19:27,989 --> 02:19:33,500
What do you advise? Assuming your goal is to save as many as possible,

916
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:38,780
then you should bring everyone together, send the power to Edgewater and convince the deserters to

917
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:47,079
return to the fold. Okay. Bring everyone together, send the power to Edgewater and convince the

918
02:19:47,079 --> 02:19:55,590
deserters to root. So you want me to do the thing that I was told to do. Isn't that what he wants

919
02:19:55,590 --> 02:19:59,989
me to do? So you want me to do that too. I'm not doing it now. I'm going to go against it.

920
02:20:00,790 --> 02:20:08,489
I'm my own president. We talked to the president. We talked to the religion president. I'm my own

921
02:20:08,489 --> 02:20:17,420
president. I'm doing my own thing. I'll keep that in mind. If it were as easy as a few soothing

922
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:22,780
words in the right ears, I'm sure it would have been done already. Consider it's a challenge.

923
02:20:24,139 --> 02:20:29,500
If you don't mind a bit of unsolicited advice, be cautious on your way to the geothermal plant.

924
02:20:30,139 --> 02:20:37,260
It is not as safe as you might assume. I've been outside. I'm not impressed. I can handle myself.

925
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:43,020
The marauders I met when I ventured outside the walls might agree with you. Would you like to come

926
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:46,940
with me and watch? Bastards snuck up on me while I was dutifully hunting for a banned book in a

927
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:53,340
collector's library. Barely escaped with my life. But you see, one of the reasons I transferred here

928
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:57,739
was to get my hands on that heretical text. Yeah, as town president, religion president,

929
02:20:58,139 --> 02:21:09,940
me president. I'd pay quite a handsome sum for the book. Really? I'll assume you want to burn it

930
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:19,930
once you get your hands on it. Why would a vicar be after a banned heretical book? I just want to keep

931
02:21:19,930 --> 02:21:24,409
the writing out of layman's hands. Spell crafting lying. It wouldn't do for such information to fall

932
02:21:24,409 --> 02:21:31,770
into public consumption. Seems like the authorities would be interested to hear that you're after this

933
02:21:31,770 --> 02:21:39,319
contraband. Maybe I'll get your book and sell it to somebody else. I can assure you, you won't

934
02:21:39,479 --> 02:21:44,760
find another willing to risk imprisonment to possess this book, nor anyone willing to pay the

935
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:56,100
price I can offer. Price? Compelling argument. Glad we see eye to eye. It's a handwritten journal,

936
02:21:56,100 --> 02:22:01,459
a faded blue cover with the name M. Bakunu handwritten in the lower corner. I'll mark

937
02:22:01,459 --> 02:22:06,739
where I saw it on your map. Assuming you're serious? Depends how serious you are.

938
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:25,459
Yeah. Thank you. If you retrieve it, you can always find me here. What am I stuck on? The chair.

939
02:22:25,459 --> 02:22:49,829
All right. Let's go. All right. Now comes the power. Let's do it. Follow me. In all capitals,

940
02:22:50,389 --> 02:23:11,190
kill a fucking NPC. Holy shit. Jesus. Why? Kill an NPC. I must be fed with bloodshed.

941
02:23:11,989 --> 02:23:29,420
Am I having fun? Yeah, I'm having fun. It's interesting so far. I feel like I'm just

942
02:23:29,420 --> 02:23:35,450
getting started. So I don't really have, you know, we're only like two hours into the game.

943
02:23:35,450 --> 02:23:50,520
That's pretty early. He doesn't want to kill people. No, I don't want to just, I don't want

944
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:58,309
to just take a, I don't want to take a dog shit on my play through. You guys want me to like

945
02:23:58,309 --> 02:24:07,500
lob a grenade into that guy's office. It's like, okay. Then I just diarrhea on my fucking play

946
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:22,600
through. All right. Am I hurt? Hey, can you be like a mind detector? Can you detect minds for me?

947
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:42,889
Wait, what does X do? All right. Should I go in here? Wait, community center. No. Who's that?

948
02:24:43,610 --> 02:25:10,139
Marauder. Told you. Here we go. Watch it. Wait, attack. Good. Exactly what I thought was going

949
02:25:10,139 --> 02:25:41,899
to happen. She dead. Are we all right? All right. Where's the, uh, we need to loot the bodies.

950
02:25:42,620 --> 02:26:03,100
Damn it. Shush. The bodies. Assault rifle. Can I give her weapons? Does she even have a weapon?

951
02:26:04,739 --> 02:26:18,979
Something you need. It's a thing. All right. Let's go. I have what I have six heels.

952
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:32,549
All right. I gotta be more careful because this is on hard bit cartridge,

953
02:26:33,350 --> 02:26:50,200
light ammo and a trip blade. All right. Don't just sprint everywhere. I have to walk.

954
02:26:53,110 --> 02:27:07,850
Evicted. Wait, there's a house over here. I'm like 39 bullets. Everyone's dead. Assault rifle.

955
02:27:09,930 --> 02:27:17,340
Makeshift low pressure suit. What's that? Give me your company. Gear in tip top shape is expected

956
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:22,219
and something you're carrying needs repair. You can repair weapons and armor at a workbench using

957
02:27:22,219 --> 02:27:26,700
weapon and armor parts. Get them a breaking down on modern items. Players with engineering skill

958
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:32,059
can repair their gear without the need of a workbench. Okay. What's wrong with me?

959
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:53,399
This needs to be repaired. Okay. I have so many of these. Can I just, was this one handed?

960
02:27:53,399 --> 02:28:00,229
This is two handed. I mean, I could just use this even though, I mean, it's, that's so much more

961
02:28:00,229 --> 02:28:17,370
damage to inspect. Um, how do I repair this? Armor management. No. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

962
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:23,129
I'm breaking down inspect them. All right. What's this? Three armor, four armor, nine armor.

963
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:41,959
That's pretty good. Tech skills plus five. Compare it. Okay. Yeah, this is better. What does this

964
02:28:41,959 --> 02:28:50,329
thing do? Stealth skills. Okay. Consumables here. You can use junk or drop your consumers.

965
02:28:51,930 --> 02:28:58,069
Your emergency medical inhaler shown at the top of the screen. It uses Adreno as fuel. Sure.

966
02:28:58,149 --> 02:29:03,000
Increase your medical skills will unlock more drug mixing slots. They can hold all types of

967
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:09,459
consumables, not just Adreno. Each slot is mixed into every puff of the inhaler for a combined

968
02:29:10,020 --> 02:29:29,020
effect. Adreno. Wait, I can breathe in like bread. How do you inhale bread? Okay. Well, that's,

969
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:38,500
I only have one slot anyways. Modifications. Range weapon mod. Magazine changes the weapon's damage

970
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:52,040
type to shock. Okay. How do I use this? General. All right. How do I, um, how do I use this stuff?

971
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:59,850
I have to use a workbench. Okay. Right. Has to be on a workbench. All right. That's good to know.

972
02:29:59,850 --> 02:30:13,639
Let me test out this right, this weapon. Uh, she's not gonna be able to cross that.

973
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:22,459
I didn't even go in this building. There's not much ammo in it. No. Ooh. Can I open this? I'm

974
02:30:22,459 --> 02:30:35,450
not smart enough to open this. Evicted or can I go in? Shit. I can't open these.

975
02:30:35,850 --> 02:31:02,979
Sleep. Dervish mist. That clone or something. Money. Noodles. Breathe that stuff in. Bin. Okay.

976
02:31:04,979 --> 02:31:13,780
All right. So we sleep. Sleep for, no, don't sleep. Resting in a bed is relaxing and moves time

977
02:31:13,780 --> 02:31:17,540
forward and in supernova difficulty, you can only rest in your bed on your ship. That way.

978
02:31:17,540 --> 02:31:31,030
Oh, that's probably terrible. Sleep for a week. He's not killing everyone. Get mad.

979
02:31:32,709 --> 02:31:42,500
Yeah. Get mad. I'm not killing everyone. Move along stranger. We don't want any trouble.

980
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:49,299
Well, you have a sniper rifle and we're standing right next to each other. So

981
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:56,020
I'm at the advantage. I don't know you. Whatever you're looking for. It ain't here. Move along.

982
02:31:56,979 --> 02:32:04,020
I'm looking for Adelaide. I need answers. Answers, huh? You must be one of those

983
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:12,809
philosophicals. Already got ourselves one of those. I'm looking for the geothermal plant.

984
02:32:13,370 --> 02:32:17,610
Reed says something about former workers living out in the wilderness. Why would I? No, don't bring

985
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:25,350
up Reed. They don't, they probably hate Reed. Where's the plant? A geowhat? Look, plants eat

986
02:32:25,350 --> 02:32:30,229
my purview. You're bitter off asking after Adelaide. Just dealing with an imbecile here. Dealing with

987
02:32:30,229 --> 02:32:40,950
idiots. I'm at, I'm of an intelligence level higher than this. You don't know what a geothermal

988
02:32:40,950 --> 02:33:03,989
plant is? Wow. Unbelievable. Do you? No. But I can pretend to. We've all got problems.

989
02:33:11,659 --> 02:33:16,780
Lady named Zoe went missing some nights ago. Just up and vanished without a trace.

990
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:22,219
The quick turn. Now I'm pacing around wondering if marauders got to her. I'll go look.

991
02:33:24,379 --> 02:33:29,899
I'll keep an eye out. It's not like Zoe to go wandering. Figured she might be out scavenging,

992
02:33:29,899 --> 02:33:34,059
but that ain't exactly her talent. Can't imagine where she's gone.

993
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:37,819
Hale's a wide place. She could be anywhere.

994
02:33:41,819 --> 02:33:53,020
Wow. Holy shit, that's horrendous. Could do without the gallows humor.

995
02:34:06,409 --> 02:34:13,129
All right, where is it? This is a deserter. If you're hungry, Stefan's got supplies.

996
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:53,319
So do you. Oops. Oh no, you, oh no, okay. And I want to sleep in your bed. Thief. No, I, look,

997
02:34:53,319 --> 02:35:08,010
I'm only a thief when I can't be seen doing it. That sounds pretty good. All right. Chicken.

998
02:35:24,149 --> 02:35:28,069
If you're hungry, there's meat turning on the spit outside. If you're bearing illness,

999
02:35:28,069 --> 02:35:30,709
find a place to lay your head down and I'll fetch you a poultice.

1000
02:35:32,149 --> 02:35:36,389
Whatever your troubles. Can you pet chicken? No. Leave them at the gates and be welcomed here.

1001
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:47,020
Any questions, dear? What's that smell? That'd be the garden, dear. You're standing

1002
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:55,180
in a garden. Also fertilizer. So mind your boots. Excuse me, Ms. McDevitt. Sorry. It's just,

1003
02:35:55,979 --> 02:36:03,450
you got such pretty trees in here. Why thank you. You're Robert's girl, aren't you?

1004
02:36:04,329 --> 02:36:11,530
I remember when you were but a sprout. Thomas speaks of you often. I want attention. Talk to

1005
02:36:11,530 --> 02:36:17,610
me. You should try some of my tobacco. That's my game. I brew it in an old spittoon,

1006
02:36:17,610 --> 02:36:27,989
but it's been cleaned. Uh, it looks like you made a home for yourself here. A home for anyone who's

1007
02:36:27,989 --> 02:36:33,909
ever turned their backs on Edgewater. A home for those of us with nowhere left to go and nothing

1008
02:36:33,909 --> 02:36:40,870
to lose. So like the spores of the puff ball cast on the wind and a lighting on fresh soil,

1009
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:53,719
we put down new roots. That's too dumb. Even if you were dumb, you wouldn't save this.

1010
02:36:59,940 --> 02:37:07,770
My goodness. All right, you just charming. You have to do the tuber choice. Uh,

1011
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:14,170
I was sent to make peace with you. Reed Thompson, you here on behalf of that cold-eyed reptile?

1012
02:37:14,969 --> 02:37:25,209
Let's hear it. What's Reed's idea? He's a lizard? I didn't know that. Oh, you're living off power

1013
02:37:25,209 --> 02:37:33,850
that belongs to the town. Come back to the cannery. That's about it. Reed asks you to

1014
02:37:33,850 --> 02:37:37,129
consider coming back to town. He's willing to make amends. Something about coming back to town or

1015
02:37:37,129 --> 02:37:43,530
losing power. I wasn't really listening. I can't say I blame you. Reed is positively soporific.

1016
02:37:44,569 --> 02:37:48,889
Like everything else that comes out of Edgewater, that peace offering is canned.

1017
02:37:49,850 --> 02:37:52,809
I and my own are living just fine out here by ourselves.

1018
02:37:56,940 --> 02:38:05,930
This is serious. I'm about to cut off your power. This is serious. You're doing this for Reed.

1019
02:38:07,129 --> 02:38:14,149
For money. For money. Money. Your camp has a power regulator. I needed to repair my ship.

1020
02:38:15,399 --> 02:38:30,600
Seemed like the right thing to do. My reasons are my own. Just like my Twitter profile. It's

1021
02:38:31,479 --> 02:38:37,340
in my biography when you go to my Twitter. If you're going down to the plant, you should

1022
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:45,020
divert power away from Edgewater and toward our end of the grid. Think about it. You'd be liberating

1023
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:52,620
an entire town from a lifetime of service to that odious cannery. Seems the sort of thing a hero

1024
02:38:52,620 --> 02:39:04,149
would do. Hero to you maybe. I'm looking for a power regulator. Reed promised me yours.

1025
02:39:05,430 --> 02:39:10,469
Cannery's got a regulator. You want ship parts, you ought to rip them out of the cannery's guts

1026
02:39:10,469 --> 02:39:20,600
and leave us be. Let's say I help you. What happens to Edgewater? Life in Edgewater grinds

1027
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:28,520
to a halt. The cannery shuts down. Workers desert in droves and our own little camp grows and thrives.

1028
02:39:29,719 --> 02:39:49,030
Y'all doing drugs here? Like you doing drugs? Because I trust you will listen to your conscience.

1029
02:39:50,870 --> 02:40:01,079
Vivardi, what should we do? Where are we headed? I don't know. You tell me.

1030
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:10,700
You mean about the mission being too clean? Might as well leave. All right, so we got

1031
02:40:11,579 --> 02:40:24,940
a long gun. What's a long gun? A sniper? What do I want here? 60. Dialogue. I want to be able to lie

1032
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:47,930
better. Is it assault rifles? At 20, medicine. I love the second drug mixing slot. Improve your

1033
02:40:47,930 --> 02:41:03,940
weapons and armor in the workbench. Okay, I want that second slot. Yep, that looks good. A new perk.

1034
02:41:05,379 --> 02:41:18,819
I have one perk point. Vendor prices. I'm just going to steal whatever I can't buy. So what's

1035
02:41:18,819 --> 02:41:23,850
the point? You take better care of your weapons and armor than most people. That's probably good.

1036
02:41:24,649 --> 02:41:37,299
Or a faster sprint. Damage when alone in a party plus 25% damage when alone. Goodbye.

1037
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:46,809
Sprint is really good though. Yeah. Yeah, faster sprint speed. That's true.

1038
02:41:51,219 --> 02:41:59,030
All right. Let's do... First, let's get this shit out of the way.

1039
02:42:06,069 --> 02:42:11,110
I can neither divert the power to Edgewater or I can not divert the power to Edgewater.

1040
02:42:11,670 --> 02:42:40,620
We have to make a decision. Look, if I'm going to give you power, then I may as well take all the

1041
02:42:40,620 --> 02:42:55,930
money. Because, I mean, look, that's fair. I do the really dangerous mission and I sacrifice

1042
02:42:55,930 --> 02:43:00,569
myself and make it so you get power diverted to you. But I take all the money in your houses.

1043
02:43:03,719 --> 02:43:16,520
That's fair. Zoe's journal. Well, today's the day, Zoe. Today is the day you take your destiny in

1044
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:21,000
your own hands. I've been listening to Grace talk about the Marauder threat. Bands of wild

1045
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:26,520
free-spirited bandits living in camps out in the hills. Barrel fires probably mounted the heads

1046
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:33,079
of their enemies on spikes as a warning to people like me. Three of any rules. I bet they could take

1047
02:43:33,079 --> 02:43:40,280
the whole region. I've been talking away some of our food. I've come to some spare cans of tuna.

1048
02:43:40,280 --> 02:43:47,350
It should last me a couple weeks. So you went there willingly. I got odds those Marauders will let

1049
02:43:47,350 --> 02:43:51,510
me throw in with them if I dangle a couple syringes of Adrena time before their eyes.

1050
02:43:52,069 --> 02:43:58,709
This is going to be great. Bandit Queen Zoe's origin story has just begun. I'm going to have

1051
02:43:58,709 --> 02:44:05,979
a whole gang of Marauders at my back. Maybe I can even score some Rizzo's. Well, that's new info.

1052
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:17,020
What about this? No more edge water for me. No more cannery. No more jumpsuits and gloves.

1053
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:21,500
Yes, ma'ams. And would you like another? I don't know why I'm writing this down for

1054
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:27,780
prosperity's sake. Fuck the cannery. I don't think I'll ever have to look back in this journal. Who

1055
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:35,620
cares? I'm going to go be a Marauder. And so I got sick. Everybody gets sick. Well, okay. I got sick

1056
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:39,620
and I grabbed a little too much Adrena time. Is that really a crime? Got to treat myself when I'm

1057
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:44,659
sick, don't I? What have I happened to personal responsibility in surviving by one's own bootstraps?

1058
02:44:45,379 --> 02:44:49,860
Oh, but you misappropriated one box of Adrena time and you suddenly you're committing larceny.

1059
02:44:59,459 --> 02:45:09,700
Pet chicken, pet chicken, pet chicken. All right. What about let me take a look at this stuff here.

1060
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:18,969
We're going to die robot, which is over here. This is in the town or it's down in the do I have to

1061
02:45:18,969 --> 02:45:31,510
go back down there? Isn't like the lab, wasn't it? Let me see the geothermal plant in the northwest

1062
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:41,739
portion of the region. So no, it's out of here. Let's go do this first. Is there a way I can

1063
02:45:41,739 --> 02:45:57,430
leave here quickly? Oh, he used to follow me around. Workbench. Wait. No, that's just a

1064
02:45:57,430 --> 02:46:08,069
regular bench. Where's workbench? There it is. Get out of my way. All right. Let's do this one.

1065
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:20,709
Install installed modifications. Install. This is a shock weapon. Modify light pistol with the mag

1066
02:46:20,709 --> 02:46:25,590
to zap. Mods can't be recovered after installation. If you install this modification of this slot,

1067
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:31,739
the current one will be destroyed. No, wait, what's in it now? Magazine size plus 50%.

1068
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:49,239
What's going to make the DPM, the damage permitted up? Yeah, let's do it. Fuck it. So wait,

1069
02:46:49,239 --> 02:47:06,790
now I can do this. Wait, where to go? Is that it? No modifications. Magazine zero. Oh, it's

1070
02:47:06,790 --> 02:47:20,950
damaged. Okay. How much does it take to repair? Repair is E. It takes more damage. Oh, eight.

1071
02:47:20,950 --> 02:47:32,659
Yo, I only have 21 weapon parts. Where's the other pistol though? Am I out of my mind?

1072
02:47:33,459 --> 02:47:50,180
Wasn't it? Didn't I have two pistols to modify? Oh, this is the companion's weapons. How do I

1073
02:47:50,180 --> 02:48:05,559
take these from you? Can I take these? I need this. All right. Give me this. All right. Let me

1074
02:48:05,559 --> 02:48:18,250
prepare. How do I take stuff from you? Inventory. General. Quests. Junk. Can I go to her inventory?

1075
02:48:20,620 --> 02:48:42,540
Click her name at the top. Uh, what do you mean her name at the top? Junko. Where? Oh my God. It's

1076
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:48,760
like another, I thought it was going to be like another inventory. Okay. Here's the companion.

1077
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:52,120
I didn't know it was going to be like on the menu. I thought it was going to be like up here,

1078
02:48:52,120 --> 02:49:03,579
like inventory, like, oh, Pavardi's menu. Whatever. Give me this. Okay. How do I take it off?

1079
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:11,799
Here. I'll take this instead. I have to replace it with something. Take the machine gun. Give me

1080
02:49:11,799 --> 02:49:23,829
this back. Actually give me this too. You take this shitty stuff. I want your stuff. Okay. Good.

1081
02:49:23,829 --> 02:49:33,479
There we go. Now it's good. Can I make ammo or anything? Okay. Repair. I don't need to do that.

1082
02:49:33,479 --> 02:49:43,290
Tinker. What's tinker? Just make you do more damage? Tinker. Yeah, let's do it. You want to

1083
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:59,579
tinker the light pistol? Yeah. Tinker it again. Tinker it again? Yeah. No. That's good. Let's break

1084
02:49:59,579 --> 02:50:08,809
this shit down. Uh, break down. What do you got? This crap. Yeah, this is a bunch of crap. Get rid

1085
02:50:08,809 --> 02:50:18,440
of it. Junk. Crap. All right. I think I'm good. Nice. Now this thing does more damage and it's

1086
02:50:18,440 --> 02:50:29,829
a shock weapon. I've already used your favorite companion. That's cool. Save the game. Let's go

1087
02:50:29,829 --> 02:50:42,069
get that thermonuclear fast driving car. All right. Let's go. Wait. I can go this way. It's still a

1088
02:50:42,069 --> 02:50:59,579
light pistol. Oh, Megalo. Well, whatever. You can laugh. I'm not. Should I not go this way?

1089
02:51:00,299 --> 02:51:31,659
Do I have no life regen? No, I do. It's very slow though. What about my food? Oh, okay. Apples.

1090
02:51:32,540 --> 02:52:04,100
Cool. You can level up the health regen. That's not a bad idea. Oh, fuck off. I knew you're going

1091
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:18,149
to make it. Whoa. Attack. That thing is, there are five damage types. Physical plasma, corrosion,

1092
02:52:18,149 --> 02:52:22,549
shock, and enray. Some enemies are horrible, but yes, I know. Shock is better. This thing

1093
02:52:22,549 --> 02:52:52,040
has a lot of health. How do I revive? All right. Let's go. Ooh, helmet. Salt rifle. A small

1094
02:52:52,040 --> 02:52:55,799
percentage of weapons and armor you find are considered pristine. They have more durability

1095
02:52:55,799 --> 02:53:13,500
and they're just really cool. Good to know. What do we got here? Hack. Ooh, can I hack it?

1096
02:53:15,819 --> 02:53:30,469
I need four hacking devices. That's a lot of stuff. Sawed off shotgun. A sight. Damn it. All right.

1097
02:53:33,420 --> 02:53:44,920
Dumb to hack. Let's sneak. Oh, fuck. There's a lot of people. All right. Is there like a

1098
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:50,819
Maylake Hill? Can I sneak up on these guys and like just let their mechanical throats?

1099
02:53:51,780 --> 02:54:21,379
Just go out there. Why are you just going out there? You just keep, you continue to die. I only have,

1100
02:54:21,379 --> 02:54:40,440
how many bullets do I have? Not very many. Ooh, flywheel? Bits. Doctor. Another light pistol.

1101
02:54:40,440 --> 02:55:07,850
This is a hundred DPS. All right. Well, here we go. This is it. The light pistol sucks, Boomer.

1102
02:55:16,040 --> 02:55:24,809
I hope we're doing the right thing. Oh, who cares? All right. Vending machine. A hack skill of 20 or

1103
02:55:24,809 --> 02:55:30,280
higher allows you to sell items to the vending machine. Cool. You can have high rep to sell

1104
02:55:30,280 --> 02:55:38,790
restricted items. All right. So what do we got? Tarmac and cheese. I need bullets. Light ammo.

1105
02:55:39,510 --> 02:55:57,899
Yeah. Let's get some light ammo. Buy the maximum. 50 out of 50. What is this? How many of these

1106
02:55:57,899 --> 02:56:19,159
should I get? Five? Sell. Only 9.4 dollars? Well, I can sell this because I don't need it.

1107
02:56:19,959 --> 02:56:36,469
Can I not sell? Oh, is this restricted or something? Where's the sell? Sell all. Don't want to click

1108
02:56:36,469 --> 02:56:45,659
that. Buy and sell items with bits. The official currency. You have not unlocked the ability to

1109
02:56:45,659 --> 02:56:51,510
sell to vending machines. Oh, I thought, I thought I was only a certain level or something. Oh,

1110
02:56:51,510 --> 02:57:34,340
fucking whatever. What? Damn it. Almost. Why did it slow him over that? Can't do it yet. Use terminal.

1111
02:57:34,340 --> 02:57:40,659
Unlock the door. Warning, this facility is in a state of lockdown. Authorization passcode required.

1112
02:57:41,219 --> 02:57:54,149
Enter passcode. Uh, welcome. R. Thompson. Personal files. Personal log. That whole head. Found him

1113
02:57:54,149 --> 02:57:58,149
fiddling around with one of the mechanicals, so I had to write him up for tampering with company

1114
02:57:58,149 --> 02:58:02,069
property just in case. I'm reading this a couple days from now and feeling bad for what I've done.

1115
02:58:02,950 --> 02:58:13,239
Let me just remind myself that I've warned him before. Okay. Personal logs. Doesn't sit right

1116
02:58:13,239 --> 02:58:17,000
with me. The company's never been wrong before. The company's been replacing our guards with

1117
02:58:17,639 --> 02:58:22,120
auto mechanicals. This right here, I'm going to end up a chief of security with no staff.

1118
02:58:22,120 --> 02:58:28,299
Okay. Uh, worse has happened. Mechanicals gone crazy. Lock myself down here. Just trying to

1119
02:58:28,299 --> 02:58:31,899
gather my courage. Gonna make a mad dash with the control room. Might be able to shut things down.

1120
02:58:34,760 --> 02:58:39,959
Greeting security chief S. Tanaka. This is an automated message initiated by Spacer's Choice

1121
02:58:39,959 --> 02:58:44,950
Worker Safety Contingency Protocols. Security lockdown has been initiated. This is not a test

1122
02:58:44,950 --> 02:58:50,790
of your behavior during this lockdown. Will be reviewed during your quarterly audit. Anxiety

1123
02:58:50,790 --> 02:58:58,200
is a common side effect of life-threatening situations. Fight back against anxiety with an

1124
02:58:58,200 --> 02:59:07,780
ice cold bottle of zero G brew. Zero G brew and ale. That's good for what ails you. I can add.

1125
02:59:07,780 --> 02:59:18,250
All right. The door is open. There's already people coming here. Under attack.

1126
02:59:19,129 --> 02:59:50,700
That's, uh, where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? I think it's flying. Just take

1127
02:59:50,700 --> 03:00:07,770
everything. I can sort it out later. Necklace. Can I sell that? Speed grip? Well, I can't sell

1128
03:00:07,770 --> 03:00:12,809
it to a vending machine, but can I, can I sell it to a person? Like a town's person? Do I have to

1129
03:00:12,809 --> 03:00:26,010
have, do I have to hack a person's brain to sell them a weapon? Okay. Let's go. All right. You go

1130
03:00:30,340 --> 03:01:11,399
Z. Right there. Hold Z is what does that do? Oh, X, Z. I'm on my way. Enemy kill. How much stuff can

1131
03:01:11,399 --> 03:01:23,239
I even carry? I hear a noise. I hear an organic sounding noise, not a mechanical sounding noise.

1132
03:01:27,190 --> 03:01:33,500
Use. What the hell did that do? Do I, did I just divert power? What did I just do? Did I

1133
03:01:33,500 --> 03:01:40,760
divert power to the, what did I just press? I hope I didn't just like do anything.

1134
03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:59,639
Self diagnostics complete. Navigation systems operational. Combat systems

1135
03:01:59,639 --> 03:02:07,559
operational. It's not the best choice. It's the spacer's choice. Okay. Why are you not attacking

1136
03:02:07,559 --> 03:02:15,559
me? Hostile actions towards spacers choice. Mechanics are contrary to logical directive.

1137
03:02:16,280 --> 03:02:24,440
Conclusion. All hostile auto-mechanicals must be defective in compliance with spacer's choice

1138
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:31,239
policy. You know what's going on. All defective auto-mechanicals must be permanently dismantled.

1139
03:02:31,239 --> 03:02:41,129
Please allow me to assist. All right. Affirmative. Mechanicide protocols loaded. Awaiting

1140
03:02:41,129 --> 03:02:49,100
confirmation. Yeah. Confirmation granted. I like the sound of that. Go for it. Go take out all

1141
03:02:49,100 --> 03:03:06,069
those mechanicals that are bad. Repair log. Corporate just sent a team of technicians to

1142
03:03:06,069 --> 03:03:15,139
conduct a complete refit of all of our mechanicals. Lore. I did routine maintenance. Found some strange

1143
03:03:15,219 --> 03:03:19,139
modifications to their logic modules. Somebody fucked with them and made them aggressive.

1144
03:03:21,479 --> 03:03:24,600
Filed the report, but my supervisor told me not to worry about it. Said the company knew

1145
03:03:24,600 --> 03:03:27,959
what it was doing. What did we forget about any alleged modifications?

1146
03:03:28,600 --> 03:03:34,629
I wrote this down so somebody would see it. Got my hands on a logic module. Time to do a little

1147
03:03:34,629 --> 03:03:46,469
bit of experimentation. Did you know? Borrowed a copy of the Young Spacer's Guide to Mechanical

1148
03:03:46,469 --> 03:03:50,629
Engineering. I think it's volume three. I need something to read down in the pit.

1149
03:03:53,030 --> 03:04:19,750
Pit. Okay. Logic module. Guy's down in the pit. Hop in pit. You're not real. You're not real.

1150
03:04:20,549 --> 03:04:27,030
He's in the pit. Where is he? Is that thing going to go kill him? All right. Where are you?

1151
03:04:36,170 --> 03:04:37,370
He's just down here?

1152
03:04:38,170 --> 03:04:54,090
Thanks for the input. Got to get it right in the belly button. Get it! Engineering 15. Shut off

1153
03:04:54,090 --> 03:05:36,579
the steam valve. Scientist. Oh, is it workbench? Yeah, I know about mods. Weapons and armor can be

1154
03:05:36,579 --> 03:05:47,540
modified. Mods can't be removed once they're used, so put them on your favorite gear. Right. All

1155
03:05:47,540 --> 03:05:59,059
right. So this is the Zapper. 173 damage. What can I do with this? I can't do anything. I can't do

1156
03:05:59,139 --> 03:06:13,350
anything. 173 damage. What can I do with this? No mods. Oh, I can. Oh, it's a scope. Should I

1157
03:06:13,350 --> 03:06:28,340
put a scope on a shotgun? Would that be stupid? Okay, this is gyrocyte. Spread is reduced. I mean,

1158
03:06:28,340 --> 03:06:34,940
yeah, this thing's pretty good. I'm probably going to use it. Whatever. This is a better scope. It's

1159
03:06:34,940 --> 03:06:46,549
better saturation. I'm just pretending I know what I'm talking about. All right, so let me equip that

1160
03:06:46,549 --> 03:06:54,889
instead. Doesn't need to be repaired. This is what I'm currently wearing. All right, what can I,

1161
03:06:54,889 --> 03:07:07,930
can I do something with this? All right, this needs to be on here. No, no, wrong. Is the one

1162
03:07:07,930 --> 03:07:23,159
that I just modified? This one. I guess I can just put it on. Let's try it. Cool. I'll try it. All

1163
03:07:23,159 --> 03:07:35,750
right, we're looking for that. There was a guy that was screaming. All right. Where's the

1164
03:07:35,750 --> 03:08:26,170
screaming? Oh, shit. Where are they? Where is it? Let me eat some food. Oh, fuck. That was actually

1165
03:08:26,170 --> 03:08:50,629
pretty scary. Okay. All right. I'm here. Ammo. Save it. This is too scary. Turn it off.

1166
03:08:50,629 --> 03:09:22,139
All right. This is where I shit on the ground. All right. All right. So that guy, where was that

1167
03:09:22,139 --> 03:09:29,879
guy? There was a guy like screaming. Is he up there? Security chiefs. Wait, why is him?

1168
03:09:30,680 --> 03:09:39,850
Security chiefs corpse. Wait, I don't think I want to use this on a locker.

1169
03:09:43,979 --> 03:10:02,170
No, Mr. Ouch. All right. Hold on a second. Do I, why do I have two different markers?

1170
03:10:02,969 --> 03:10:11,829
There's that one and then there's this one. Why are there two markers? One of them is for

1171
03:10:12,870 --> 03:10:36,010
move mouse over the markers to see where they are or what they are. I mean, I'm on the wrong

1172
03:10:36,010 --> 03:10:51,739
floor. How do I move the map up? Objective. Objective. Is this for the same objective though?

1173
03:10:52,459 --> 03:10:58,229
Oh, did I get baited? Oh, well. All right. Well, I'm just going to go back up here.

1174
03:10:59,270 --> 03:11:05,540
Aim at the markers in the world. Security chiefs corpse and logic module. Right. Because the guy

1175
03:11:05,540 --> 03:11:14,950
that's screaming. All right. Let's get the module. It's behind this though. How the fuck do I get in

1176
03:11:14,950 --> 03:11:32,579
there? Should I not be shooting you? Wait, was this the thing I activated? The corpse has the key.

1177
03:11:38,409 --> 03:11:50,469
I guess I could like pick the lock though. All right. Security officers corpse. I need to get

1178
03:11:50,469 --> 03:11:54,149
up here and down this way. So what's the correct way to go this way? I have to go up the stairs

1179
03:11:54,149 --> 03:11:58,389
around somehow over here and then up, I guess. I don't know this. I turned on the fucking

1180
03:11:59,350 --> 03:12:07,750
ooze elevator. So I guess I'm going to go. You're not real. Is there a way to go up? This is it.

1181
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:21,510
This is going down. Damn it, man. This is the thing that I repaired. It's killing this guy.

1182
03:12:21,510 --> 03:12:37,940
It's killing him. Just kill it. No. Load save. Load save. Load save. Where is it? Which one is it?

1183
03:12:37,940 --> 03:12:51,379
Quick save. Quick save. Auto save. This one at 319 right here. All right. Come with me.

1184
03:12:52,180 --> 03:12:59,659
So I have to go all the way. I have to go down and then up. Where did he just put me?

1185
03:13:00,219 --> 03:13:16,200
I have to go back to that pit. All right. So wait, hold on. You're right here. Give me the key card.

1186
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:24,299
Thank you. And give me your machine gun. Fine. That was hidden behind a fucking block. All right.

1187
03:13:24,299 --> 03:13:48,420
Now let's go over here. Spard. I can't open. What? Module. Let's go. Tactical shotgun. All right.

1188
03:13:48,420 --> 03:14:00,549
Pretty cool. Okay. Now I got die robot. Head back to the landing pad and deliver the logic module

1189
03:14:00,549 --> 03:14:14,540
to Ludwig. Got it. I got a shotgun too. Now it's either divert power or divert power. I mean,

1190
03:14:14,540 --> 03:14:26,059
now which one of these am I going to do? How far away is this one? It's far. All right. Let's get

1191
03:14:26,059 --> 03:14:34,420
out of here. Who do I want to save? What city do I care about? This is a very good question.

1192
03:14:47,450 --> 03:14:58,069
Pole? No, I'm going to, I'll make a decision. I mean, why am I leaving? What about the guy at

1193
03:14:58,069 --> 03:15:15,540
the bottom of the pit? I guess there was the guy there. Maybe I'll go look for that guy. Save him.

1194
03:15:20,729 --> 03:15:26,489
All right. So I got to go to the pit. He's down here. You hear him screaming. What was the way

1195
03:15:26,489 --> 03:15:39,850
to go? Should I just go down? What are these things even for? This is probably some other

1196
03:15:39,850 --> 03:15:46,149
quest or something that I didn't get before coming in here. I'm assuming. I don't know.

1197
03:15:46,709 --> 03:15:55,049
All right. So where's that pit? Where's the pit? Right in the middle,

1198
03:16:01,450 --> 03:16:18,709
back around this way and down the hall. That's the pit I'm assuming. Should I just go this way?

1199
03:16:19,430 --> 03:16:36,790
And down. Okay. I have to find a way down to you. I'm coming. I'm coming down.

1200
03:16:37,590 --> 03:17:06,200
I'll be there in a minute. For a second I thought this was the guy from the beginning of the game.

1201
03:17:09,459 --> 03:17:14,920
Phantoms where? You can talk? The phantoms never talked before.

1202
03:17:15,639 --> 03:17:22,180
I knew I shouldn't have eaten that Sprat raw. See? See Higgins? This is why you must always boil

1203
03:17:22,180 --> 03:17:32,940
your Sprats before ingesting. Higgins. This phantoms got a name. All right. Slow down. What's

1204
03:17:32,940 --> 03:17:36,860
going on? Clearly I mistook you for one of the phantoms of my imagination which terrorized me

1205
03:17:36,860 --> 03:17:43,639
on occasion. Chester D. Higgins. The D stands for definitely not insane. I use it as a reminder.

1206
03:17:48,229 --> 03:17:53,270
How long have you been down here? Hard to say. By my reckoning Higgins has been here somewhere

1207
03:17:53,270 --> 03:18:02,299
between two weeks and forever. My recollections a touch fuzzy these days. Okay. Oh Higgins has

1208
03:18:02,299 --> 03:18:07,979
been many things over the years. Sprat Wrangler, Saltuna Critic, Aether Wave Personality,

1209
03:18:07,979 --> 03:18:14,299
Chairman of the Board, Galactic Defender, Sissy Pig Tycoon. I've come a long way for someone who

1210
03:18:14,299 --> 03:18:22,219
started off as a simple engineer right here in this plant. Oh you. We have that in common. You

1211
03:18:22,219 --> 03:18:27,899
and I are both engineers. I specialized in auto-mechanicals, drones, sentries. That's a good

1212
03:18:27,899 --> 03:18:33,100
talking point. Peridum maintained, upgraded. Did it all from my old workroom just over in the next

1213
03:18:33,100 --> 03:18:48,780
section. Okay. Right was that before or after you became a Sissy Pig Tycoon? How do you stop? Look

1214
03:18:48,780 --> 03:18:52,860
I don't want to fall into any trouble with the mechanicals. If they wise up to our plans they

1215
03:18:52,860 --> 03:19:02,579
will come for us with prodding irons. I'm not afraid of any mechanicals. I can't even spell

1216
03:19:02,579 --> 03:19:11,159
mechanicals. Or you can help me and I won't feed you to the Sprats. Your call. Why 46? Spacer's Choice

1217
03:19:11,159 --> 03:19:21,819
sent me here to rescue you. You can trust me. Dumb and persuading is the way. You know you remind

1218
03:19:21,819 --> 03:19:27,340
me of myself back when I was an intergalactic adventurer. I discovered a flaw. Their hostility

1219
03:19:27,340 --> 03:19:31,739
levels were hardwired to maximum. There's no changing that but you could rewrite their targeting

1220
03:19:31,739 --> 03:19:37,610
protocols so they attack each other instead. No wonder they're so angry. Somebody messed around

1221
03:19:37,610 --> 03:19:43,209
with their logic modules. Yes that's exactly it. I see you're also versed in the noble art of

1222
03:19:43,209 --> 03:19:46,329
mechanical engineering. That wasn't dumb that was just engineering. There's a behavior control

1223
03:19:46,329 --> 03:19:50,569
terminal in the other room. It should have options to change how the mechanicals act

1224
03:19:50,569 --> 03:19:56,809
including whom they shoot at. Oh that reminds me you'll need my passcode to access the behavior

1225
03:19:56,809 --> 03:20:06,840
control terminal. Here let me just write it down. Okay. The tail. Definitely start with the tail.

1226
03:20:06,840 --> 03:20:14,709
If you're feeling adventurous the ears are a particular delicacy. Actually hang on. Forgot

1227
03:20:14,709 --> 03:20:19,909
what you were gonna say? Me too. Time to divert power. Uh just go fuck yourself I don't care

1228
03:20:19,909 --> 03:20:25,909
anymore. All right uh let's take your impact hammer because it's mine now and your lubricant

1229
03:20:25,909 --> 03:20:46,280
is mine. Okay do I want to save the botanical garden place or do I want to save the uh the high

1230
03:20:46,280 --> 03:20:54,579
taxes workers are made out of gold bars? I don't know. I'm not sure what I want to do.

1231
03:20:56,889 --> 03:21:15,100
How do I need to go? Reprogram the bots so they don't attack you. Did I already do that?

1232
03:21:17,190 --> 03:21:48,010
I did it to one of them. Uh what is it? Long tomorrow? No no no no no no. Am I going the

1233
03:21:48,010 --> 03:21:52,700
right way here? Do I have to like wrap back around? What was that power room?

1234
03:22:02,040 --> 03:22:22,340
What is it? Another one. Save the capitalists. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have no idea

1235
03:22:22,340 --> 03:22:33,770
what I'm gonna do. Here we go. Do I just flip a coin? Should I let fate decide? Maybe I should

1236
03:22:33,770 --> 03:22:44,120
let fate decide. Redirect power. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait did I just do it? I didn't

1237
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:49,590
get a choice. Safety failures detected. High likelihood of moderate or severe structural

1238
03:22:49,590 --> 03:22:55,579
damage. Redirecting power is an irreversible procedure. Power redirection functions failed.

1239
03:22:55,579 --> 03:23:09,239
Manual override required. Please activate all three electrical track switches. What? Oh it's

1240
03:23:09,239 --> 03:23:17,700
those things those things I have to activate. Oh god the goo tanks. Yeah of course you're gonna

1241
03:23:17,700 --> 03:23:20,500
put me on a mission where I have to go activate the goo tanks. I should have just done them.

1242
03:23:21,299 --> 03:23:42,010
Where is this one? Over here. Got it. Okay flip a coin. Go to go to random.org and just type in

1243
03:23:42,010 --> 03:23:55,739
two and then press enter 50 times and then whatever it is. Once we do this there's the

1244
03:23:55,739 --> 03:24:00,780
Hey mister. Whoa. Look I know you want your power regulator and all. She's like wait don't do this

1245
03:24:00,780 --> 03:24:08,020
I'm not gonna talk to you. Do you understand what you're about to do? I know exactly what I'm doing.

1246
03:24:08,020 --> 03:24:10,899
Well what's your opinion? I don't think you should cut off Edgewater's power. I think it would be

1247
03:24:10,899 --> 03:24:17,299
cruel. Well. I'm sorry that just sort of came out all at once. Didn't she want me to do anything?

1248
03:24:17,299 --> 03:24:21,540
We've been losing workers year after year and corporate hardly ever sends replacements.

1249
03:24:22,100 --> 03:24:26,420
There's barely enough salt tuna to fill our bellies anymore but the town's got some good

1250
03:24:26,420 --> 03:24:31,940
people in it. Decent hard-working folk just living their lives the only way they know how.

1251
03:24:33,430 --> 03:24:39,750
They don't deserve to be punished. Well this isn't like Fallout 3. I'm not I'm not like nuking a city.

1252
03:24:41,049 --> 03:24:52,149
I'm just turning their power off. I'm just I'm just turning off their power temporarily and then

1253
03:24:52,149 --> 03:24:58,790
we'll figure it out. Okay Reid tells me Edgewater is going to die without workers in power. The

1254
03:24:58,790 --> 03:25:03,350
deserters are a community. I can't just destroy what they built. I think I'm ready to make my

1255
03:25:03,350 --> 03:25:08,149
decision. Sorry I didn't mean to babble off like that. I just I felt like I had to say something.

1256
03:25:08,870 --> 03:25:15,909
That's where it's way here. Don't worry about it. I was barely listening to you. Oh well okay then.

1257
03:25:15,909 --> 03:25:24,629
I made that really clear that I was very heavily listening. I'm like I'm a dick. All right here we

1258
03:25:24,629 --> 03:25:38,700
go. Redirect power. Safety failures. Are you sure you want to continue? Redirecting power is an

1259
03:25:38,700 --> 03:25:43,659
irreversible procedure. Redirect power to Edgewater. Redirect power to Botanical Laboratory.

1260
03:25:44,459 --> 03:26:14,950
I've got I've got my Nivea lip balm. If it lands heads is no no I'm gonna okay is it weird that

1261
03:26:14,950 --> 03:26:22,409
I'm just going by how much I liked traversing the town. It has nothing to do with any of the stuff

1262
03:26:22,409 --> 03:26:27,370
going on. It's just which town do I think is more interesting to be like walk around in.

1263
03:26:28,010 --> 03:26:49,299
The power regulator is now safe to remove from Botanical Laboratory. Edgewater Saltuna

1264
03:26:49,299 --> 03:27:02,940
Canary power regulator is now operating at optimal capacity. All right I did it. We did it.

1265
03:27:03,659 --> 03:27:18,950
Now give me the power regulator. Thank you. Where is it? Give me this stuff first.

1266
03:27:21,110 --> 03:27:30,649
Ah it's behind a door. Hold on. Access the files. Access the files. Open the door.

1267
03:27:33,129 --> 03:27:47,639
Where is the open door code? I don't know. Oh I don't even need one. Vending machine.

1268
03:27:48,280 --> 03:27:59,350
No I'm good. I'm good. Wait where's the power? Where is it? Triggered the power regulator? Is it

1269
03:27:59,350 --> 03:28:11,799
outside? Jerma you literally would have to only have two conversations to make the deserters

1270
03:28:11,799 --> 03:28:16,620
come back and then Edgewater gets better. Uh thanks for the advice person who's played

1271
03:28:16,620 --> 03:28:49,180
through the game already. Appreciate it. And he's wrong is he? I don't know. Wait a minute. All

1272
03:28:49,180 --> 03:28:55,500
right so uh where's the uh oh I have to go actually to the lab and go get it. Oh I don't

1273
03:28:55,500 --> 03:29:03,239
want to do that. I don't like that. I have to go I have to go into the place that I just destroyed.

1274
03:29:06,549 --> 03:29:09,909
I don't want to do I can't just like there's not a core that I just take

1275
03:29:09,909 --> 03:29:17,829
from inside the lab that's I don't like this. I'm currently I'm the I'm stuck in the like person

1276
03:29:17,829 --> 03:29:47,059
zoo here. You can't just text them to break up. Right but are they gonna be hostile? It's all

1277
03:29:47,059 --> 03:29:57,819
right. I'll just lie. Do I can I put my lie to 50 so I can just tell them I didn't do it?

1278
03:29:59,850 --> 03:30:09,719
Their power got diverted somehow and I'm just coming to check on them. You got your lights

1279
03:30:09,719 --> 03:30:36,149
are still on you're fine. No that's not a good that guy's got a rifle. Yeah I know I'm trying

1280
03:30:36,149 --> 03:30:47,000
to think. F***ed up what happened. I know I heard the news. It's okay everybody keeps staring at me.

1281
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:49,879
It's not my fault the power's dead. Yes it is. You did it. This person did it. Whoa

1282
03:30:50,840 --> 03:30:56,840
Miss Parvati. Who's this person here? Hey you're uh what um how are you huh hi hi hello

1283
03:30:58,120 --> 03:31:03,559
are you uh that's the beginning of every one of my streams how you keeping that's how every intro

1284
03:31:03,559 --> 03:31:09,719
starts great just great I've been trying to keep stuff running just like you only I'm not so wait

1285
03:31:10,440 --> 03:31:17,319
they didn't kick you out did they oh gosh no I'm just along with this fella here I've seen you

1286
03:31:17,319 --> 03:31:25,100
wandering around here you don't look like you're coming from town I'm just trying to get my ship

1287
03:31:25,100 --> 03:31:29,260
off the ground never heard it phrased in such a way before I guess we're all trying to get our

1288
03:31:29,260 --> 03:31:35,110
ships off the ground ain't we sorry I just wasn't sure if you were from town or if you were one of

1289
03:31:35,110 --> 03:31:43,030
us something's been chewing at me you see what's wrong fact is I've been well lying to everybody

1290
03:31:43,030 --> 03:31:48,469
here camp thinks I'm a mechanical genius but I couldn't fix a busted chair don't tell them I

1291
03:31:48,469 --> 03:31:56,469
like this okay I like this guy uh never too late to start learning I can give you a couple

1292
03:31:56,469 --> 03:32:02,309
pointers we could both be lying idiot engineers I'll take all the help I can get I set my mind

1293
03:32:02,309 --> 03:32:07,750
to learning the craft of the engineer you see I want to make something of myself you ever heard

1294
03:32:07,750 --> 03:32:13,270
of the young spacer's guide to mechanical engineering comes in a set of three if I had

1295
03:32:13,270 --> 03:32:18,870
my hands on one of those data pads I could teach myself the ins and outs those are good

1296
03:32:19,670 --> 03:32:24,629
my dad kept a copy with him when he was working in the cannery I know the old community center

1297
03:32:24,629 --> 03:32:30,870
kept the copy should find another one back in town if you could find me even one of those pads

1298
03:32:30,870 --> 03:32:39,750
I'd be greatly obliged one give me money too I'll pay you for every pad you bring me

1299
03:32:40,309 --> 03:32:45,110
if by some miracle you can bring me the full set I'll give you something pretty I've been

1300
03:32:45,110 --> 03:32:52,659
saving for a lucky day okay what about the third one I wish I knew I wagered the town

1301
03:32:52,739 --> 03:33:02,299
at the full set once upon a time where the third's gone I can't say would you I'd be grateful but

1302
03:33:02,299 --> 03:33:15,260
wait you oh you're gonna have to go to the town right you're gonna have to go to edge the I don't

1303
03:33:15,260 --> 03:33:19,260
remember the name of the town I swear to god edge don't tell me I'm not I'm not gonna let this

1304
03:33:19,260 --> 03:33:27,290
fuck me up edge stone hedge stone edge edge

1305
03:33:31,750 --> 03:33:48,309
edge uh what was it called edge hall edge edge wood is it edge wood edge water

1306
03:33:52,569 --> 03:34:05,000
edge water right you're all gonna be an edge water soon oh wait this is I get to just take

1307
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:13,930
their power that's the thing about growing old your eyes start to fail elsewise I would

1308
03:34:13,930 --> 03:34:19,450
have seen you for the snake that you are chopped you into pieces and roasted you on a spit

1309
03:34:20,680 --> 03:34:27,479
this is all you're doing cutting off my power killing off my garden without refrigeration

1310
03:34:27,479 --> 03:34:34,860
my food will spoil and my flock will starve I want to ask you this in private away from the

1311
03:34:35,020 --> 03:34:43,899
I didn't call myself a snake tell me why did you do it lie give me a lie damn it

1312
03:34:45,020 --> 03:34:49,879
this isn't personal Adelaide I need your power regular I don't know I like pressing buttons I

1313
03:34:49,879 --> 03:34:58,649
guess are you really this moronic or are you just putting on airs listen here whole head I'm only

1314
03:34:58,649 --> 03:35:05,850
gonna say this once go talk to grace and Thomas look them in the eye and tell them their life

1315
03:35:05,850 --> 03:35:13,370
here is over and the only thing left to do is go back to edge water this is now your responsibility

1316
03:35:14,329 --> 03:35:20,090
and you tell Reid Thompson that I will never return to edge water I would rather die among

1317
03:35:20,090 --> 03:35:26,809
my flowers than live under his management different scenario what if I go back and kill

1318
03:35:26,809 --> 03:35:32,870
Reid Thompson and then you I I take over the town and I'll be nice to everybody

1319
03:35:41,780 --> 03:35:47,940
you offering the cross read off huh this some sort of twisted reparation for what you've done

1320
03:35:47,940 --> 03:35:54,420
wait what I can do this looking for a chance to sow some chaos kill Reid if you must what

1321
03:35:54,420 --> 03:36:00,819
talk him into leaving if you can he and I are not sharing the same four hold on am I doing a double

1322
03:36:00,819 --> 03:36:11,860
cross on a double cross kill Reid if you must what happened to you all this anger had to come from

1323
03:36:12,500 --> 03:36:18,649
my son worked in that cannery when the plague started coming he was one of the first to fall

1324
03:36:18,649 --> 03:36:26,409
sick we had a store of medicine locked away but Reid refused to treat him said my boy didn't

1325
03:36:26,409 --> 03:36:31,129
deserve treatment said the medicine would have been wasted on him yeah so we get rid of the bad

1326
03:36:31,129 --> 03:36:38,459
guy we unify everybody and I run the place my belongings and left that's as much of the story

1327
03:36:38,459 --> 03:36:46,840
as you need to hear Reid isn't just gonna all right yeah fine

1328
03:36:57,639 --> 03:37:15,770
from Edgewater okay I think we got a deal okay guys look you know I got good news and bad news

1329
03:37:15,770 --> 03:37:22,010
food's bound to spoil at this rate look the good news is that you have to leave what happened the

1330
03:37:22,010 --> 03:37:28,809
bad news is that I'm gonna kill Reid and I'm gonna be your boss no other way reverse that

1331
03:37:28,809 --> 03:37:38,440
marauders can't see us in the dark wild canids on the other hand uh go back to Edgewater the

1332
03:37:38,440 --> 03:37:44,729
matter's been weighing on me I'm staying put until I know what's become a zoe oh don't even please

1333
03:37:44,729 --> 03:37:48,809
don't want that question haunting me all the way back to the cannery I don't want to do that quest

1334
03:37:59,020 --> 03:38:06,739
really I have to do that who else do we need I need to convince somebody else

1335
03:38:07,379 --> 03:38:14,229
who else do I have to convince I don't know how much longer we'll I don't know how much

1336
03:38:14,309 --> 03:38:18,389
I don't know how much longer we'll keep your wits about you keep your wits about you

1337
03:38:18,389 --> 03:38:24,790
keep your wits about you stop copying each other clearly you heard her say that keep your wits

1338
03:38:24,790 --> 03:38:29,270
about you keep your wits about you keep your wits about you I don't know how much longer

1339
03:38:29,270 --> 03:38:37,930
will last without power thank you any luck finding one of those manuals go back to Edgewater

1340
03:38:38,489 --> 03:38:44,809
I've been thinking about going back I'm not much used to anybody here I get sick thinking about

1341
03:38:44,809 --> 03:38:50,489
working at the cannery I can't do that again don't worry I mentioned those manuals on mechanical

1342
03:38:50,489 --> 03:38:55,290
engineering oh come on suppose if I had one of those I could go back to Reed and make a real case

1343
03:38:55,290 --> 03:39:19,139
for myself all right let's go get Zoe you can't be far right only 340 only 343 feet kill Reed first

1344
03:39:23,540 --> 03:39:33,799
well I need the power regulator kill Reed then kill her

1345
03:39:38,389 --> 03:40:00,379
both they'll go kill come back wow you did it yep uh that's just absolute chaos all right so

1346
03:40:00,379 --> 03:40:11,000
hold on I'm not gonna touch anything I'm gonna go get rid of Reed uh let's go get her to Reed

1347
03:40:11,719 --> 03:40:24,020
fuck I'm a man of my word I'm a man of my word temporarily right so I'm gonna go get rid of

1348
03:40:24,020 --> 03:40:29,780
Reed I'm gonna come back I did that I told you I was gonna do that and I did I also come up with

1349
03:40:29,780 --> 03:40:49,260
new ideas on the fly all the time and second idea is get rid of you too it's temporarily all right so

1350
03:40:50,219 --> 03:40:58,090
Reed now what if I tell Reed about the plan that I'm coming to kill him could I double cross the

1351
03:40:58,090 --> 03:41:01,610

1389
03:49:16,629 --> 03:49:23,639
impasse stewardship over this town has been entrusted to me by spacers choice I am not perfect

1390
03:49:23,639 --> 03:49:34,309
I have made my share of mistakes but I have done my best for this town the town's terrified of

outpost administrator for Edgewater whether through the shedding of my mortal coil for

1406
03:52:26,649 --> 03:52:32,569
natural causes or through early retirement passed on somebody else you most importantly

1407
03:52:32,569 --> 03:52:38,409
it is imperative that you keep the spacers choice family together Adelaide McDevitt and

1408
03:52:38,409 --> 03:52:42,090
her followers have taken camp in the old botanical lab their place is here working with us

1409
03:52:43,510 --> 03:52:51,540
Adelaide is impervious to reason and refuses to entertain diplomatic overtures the only way to

1410
03:52:51,540 --> 03:52:54,819
introduce her and come back is by heading the plant cutting of power and leading her people

1411
03:52:54,819 --> 03:53:02,170
back to Edgewater with the power shut off the can like really okay I'm corporate your request

1412
03:53:02,170 --> 03:53:07,530

1413
03:53:07,530 --> 03:53:11,690
ago by my predecessor sir any authorations expansions repairs to this wall must be signed

1414

1424
03:55:38,229 --> 03:55:45,819
game that way you have choices that you have to make I feel like reverting on one of those choices

1425
03:55:45,819 --> 03:55:53,690
is kind of going against the nature of the game that's the only likable character in the game

1426
03:55:56,680 --> 03:56:35,639
is that true that can't be true all right I've delivered reads message so what do I want to do

1427
03:56:35,639 --> 03:56:52,139

1431
03:58:30,309 --> 03:58:48,309
all dead I wish I had my companion that says that's the last of them she'll be back she'll be back

1432
03:58:48,950 --> 03:59:10,500
all right here we go all right time for a new guy we're gonna have a new companion

1433
03:59:11,379 --> 03:59:23,129

1434
03:59:23,129 --> 03:59:27,850
letter today corporate ordered me to relocate to the edgewater cannery effective immediately

1435
03:59:28,729 --> 03:59:32,170
it's a shame I was really looking forward to running my own gift shop at the community

1436
03:59:32,170 --> 03:59:37,370
center selling rare memorabilia but scripture tells us that all things happen for a reason

1437
03:59:37,370 --> 03:59:42,010
work fortifies the spirit and all as for my book collection I can't bear to part with it

1438
03:59:42,010 --> 03:59:49,049
don't want those books malding in some contraband lunker like chat currently is over the loss

1439
03:59:49,049 --> 03:59:52,729
of their favorite character who they deem to be the only likable person in the game

1440
03:59:53,770 --> 03:59:58,250
but I find that to be an untrue statement so I stashed them all the way in a cave by the river

1441
03:59:58,250 --> 04:00:08,139
no I didn't do that to chat members I stashed the books I died through them all in a river

not everybody has to have the same companion we're gonna get we're gonna get this guy just

1457
04:04:00,040 --> 04:04:04,709
wait until he does his first magic spell and I think everyone's gonna have their minds changed

1458
04:04:05,430 --> 04:04:33,559
this guy's gonna cast fireballs and shit and you guys are oh this guy is awesome actually he's

1459
04:04:33,559 --> 04:04:42,809
gonna be cast in fireballs ice bolts shadow bolts isn't magic in this game if you come to ask

1460
04:04:42,809 --> 04:04:48,409
forgiveness for Reid Thompson's murder I'm afraid OSI theology has little to say on the matter what

1461
04:04:48,409 --> 04:04:58,790
does everybody know I killed him what are you talking about murderer I didn't do anything I was

1462
04:04:58,790 --> 04:05:05,350
told it was a stranger come to town I see no other strangers about but the workers of Edgewater may

1463
04:05:05,350 --> 04:05:10,629
not be the most reliable witnesses of course how dare you you know what how dare you accuse me of

1464
04:05:10,629 --> 04:05:17,459
something like that I should leave I should just leave I mean I got your book but I should get out

1465
04:05:17,459 --> 04:05:25,829
of here this is fantastic well worth all the sacrifices I wait what the fuck is this

1466
04:05:27,430 --> 04:05:34,469
French I can't fucking read French it's a law-forsaken joke is what it is French

1467
04:05:35,989 --> 04:05:40,950
I was so high and mighty preaching to the yokels about following the plan

1468
04:05:41,030 --> 04:05:47,430
while fighting it at every turn you guys said this guy sucks be sure he's fucking nuts

1469
04:05:51,770 --> 04:05:59,049
you're overreacting a bit don't you think over overreacting do you have any idea how many years I

1470
04:05:59,049 --> 04:06:07,610
spent in no you couldn't possibly know could you I've spent my life searching for the keys to

1471
04:06:07,610 --> 04:06:13,129
unlocking the secrets of the universal equation that underlies the plan I had hoped this book

1472
04:06:13,370 --> 04:06:19,610
some of those answers I became so desperate I even got myself assigned to this plague-ridden

1473
04:06:19,610 --> 04:06:27,209
water to find the damn thing all the time and suffering I've spent liar love liars

1474
04:06:29,540 --> 04:06:34,579
both I mean is he is he a med is he are you into medicine I think I'm gonna get along just fine

1475
04:06:37,049 --> 04:06:40,489
at least still have your mission work here to give you a meaningful purpose why did you think the

1476
04:06:40,489 --> 04:06:46,840
book held the secrets you're looking for this has to be some kind of cosmic retribution what

1477
04:06:47,079 --> 04:06:51,959
are you going to see the author had some interesting theories about man's perception

1478
04:06:51,959 --> 04:06:55,719
of reality that I thought could be applied to our attempts to decipher the plan

1479
04:06:56,760 --> 04:07:02,520
unfortunately he was also one of the founders of the philosopher's school of thought so the book

1480
04:07:02,520 --> 04:07:16,469
is banned in this colony a vicar searching for a banned book that's a bad example the story of my

1481
04:07:16,469 --> 04:07:22,469
life most lay people are not aware of this but we've not discovered any new insights into the

1482
04:07:22,469 --> 04:07:30,040
plan for a long long time I had an idea that we should welcome the truth no matter where we

1483
04:07:30,040 --> 04:07:36,680
found it I had the worst idea to share my thoughts with the superior and that's how I ended up

1484
04:07:36,680 --> 04:07:41,879
assigned prison duty so if everybody knows I killed the bear an inmate bend my ear with stories of

1485
04:07:41,879 --> 04:07:51,860
an original bukonu journal why wouldn't they arrest me what is that philosophism's a false

1486
04:07:51,860 --> 04:07:57,860
religion that stands in contradiction to almost everything we know to be true they believe all is

1487
04:07:57,860 --> 04:08:03,059
chaos in stark contrast to osi's belief in the plan where's their place but most of the

1488
04:08:03,059 --> 04:08:08,819
philosophist perversion of bukonu's thoughts came more than a century after his death but that's

1489
04:08:08,819 --> 04:08:14,500
neither here nor there what I need to do now is to find a translator obviously but to do that

1490
04:08:14,500 --> 04:08:20,100
I'll first need to secure transport I got you you have a ship perhaps I could make myself of

1491
04:08:20,100 --> 04:08:29,260
use to your crew I think so you need to ride out of town I wouldn't mind a ship hand certainly

1492
04:08:29,819 --> 04:08:34,940
I already gave you most of my money but I can offer you free spiritual counseling and I'd be

1493
04:08:34,940 --> 04:08:40,299
happy to watch your back okay that sounds like a great idea toss ball stick or any blunt instrument

1494
04:08:40,299 --> 04:08:46,780
really I'm also a passable gun hand if it comes to that I can usually talk my way out of conflict

1495
04:08:46,780 --> 04:08:51,739
though yep that's this oh this is my I'm fairly competent at hacking computers as well and he's

1496
04:08:51,739 --> 04:09:02,979
a computer hacker is that all part of your training let's go fantastic let me get my things in order

1497
04:09:02,979 --> 04:09:08,979
and I'll catch up with you I shall see you on the ship captain whenever you're ready to leave emerald

1501
04:10:01,340 --> 04:10:07,819
you mentioned a logic module I found one bang up work soldier you're a credit to your uniform

1502
04:10:08,459 --> 04:10:17,190
oh that reminds me got a look into getting us a uniform so this is it then the key to humanity's

1503
04:10:17,190 --> 04:10:23,450
victory over the mechanical hordes I would reward you with the gratitude of the resistance but

1504
04:10:24,010 --> 04:10:30,329
I'm guessing you want something tactile so here's a couple bits for your trouble and a little

1505
04:10:30,329 --> 04:10:42,840
something to remember me by and a shock stick oh cool thanks I'm kidding let me see what that is

1506
04:10:45,700 --> 04:10:56,870
one-handed cool shock stick I'll put it on in place of this let's check it out

1507
04:11:02,299 --> 04:11:20,469
loud weapon cool all right it's always far away damn now put that into the trash why would I do

1508
04:11:20,469 --> 04:11:57,079
that fast travel fast travel fast travel is this the entire map um no probably not it's probably

1509
04:11:57,079 --> 04:12:13,049
different areas it's different planets it's not the entire game this guys this game is like two

1510
04:12:13,049 --> 04:12:18,969
to three hundred hours long just to do these story missions if you did them as fast as possible

1511
04:12:18,969 --> 04:12:35,799
the whole game takes about 700 hours to complete all right let's scout it out

1512
04:12:36,520 --> 04:12:51,129
I knew that was gonna happen it's okay eat something I'm gonna be encumbered again aren't I

1513
04:12:54,489 --> 04:13:16,860
speedrun stream nah nah this thing's fucking amazing all right I'm only gonna use sniper rifle

1514
04:13:16,860 --> 04:13:57,930
though oh that's a lot of people what's going on did I get a dog friend it's going in where did it

1515
04:13:57,930 --> 04:14:13,190
go did I think I just heard it die no oh no that's their dog okay let's I gotta be accurate

1516
04:14:13,190 --> 04:15:20,760
that's gonna kill me isn't it oh shit they're after me oh fuck what's that that's why they ran away

1517
04:15:28,420 --> 04:15:55,799
okay new plan we're gonna stealth into this room this way around the back I just have to go in

1518
04:15:55,799 --> 04:16:15,940
there and talk to Zoe you see anybody why don't I have a button that I can press in every action

1519
04:16:15,940 --> 04:16:23,959
game ever made after 2014 to go and see everything through the walls to see every interactable object

1520
04:16:23,959 --> 04:16:43,860
and see all people in all things that I can activate every five seconds the fuck they the

1521
04:16:43,940 --> 04:16:57,270
fuck is going on he tripped on his own mind why does that detect me doesn't that make no sense

1522
04:17:16,010 --> 04:17:20,250
all right well let's try this again this time I hope they don't trip their own minds

1523
04:17:21,129 --> 04:18:24,170
I'm gonna go this way don't do it where's this dog oh no I'm fine nobody got alerted all right

1526
04:19:23,239 --> 04:19:29,319
find proof on Zoe's corpse you found Zoe then promptly killed her you could probably tell

1527
04:19:29,319 --> 04:19:32,920
grace you found her that way but you should probably see if you can find anything on Zoe's

1528
04:19:32,920 --> 04:19:42,649
corpse that grace might recognize oh come on what now I have to sneak back in

1529
04:19:44,379 --> 04:19:47,500
I have to sneak back in the compound to take something

1530
04:19:50,709 --> 04:20:08,229
okay hold on I have new perks and new skills I need to do hold on let's get some more medical

1533
04:20:23,299 --> 04:20:29,829
terrifies error effect is 100 and let's go back into ranged oh wait a minute yeah I want 50 for

1534
04:20:29,829 --> 04:20:50,629

here you go wait how much is this worth no price I'm not in the lightest of humors right now

1545
04:25:22,149 --> 04:25:35,909
uh Zoe's not coming back you want to expand on that yes she went feral I had to put her down

1546
04:25:36,549 --> 04:25:40,219
I was hoping you wouldn't say that I was really hoping

1547
04:25:41,340 --> 04:25:50,489
you'd better not be spinning me a story I could bring back her body if you want might have to make

1548
04:25:50,489 --> 04:25:57,850
a few trips Jesus yeah that belonged to her well enough guess there's no arguing with you

1549
04:25:58,729 --> 04:26:06,170
you pretty much did my job for me least I could do is pay you for your trouble let me know if I

1550
04:26:06,170 --> 04:26:13,049
can do something for you I got money for that too thanks yes uh there is something you can do

1551
04:26:13,049 --> 04:26:20,200
I'm not in the lightest of humors right now it's time for you to go home all right uh I gotta find

1552
04:26:20,200 --> 04:26:32,950
this guy's book but but but but unfortunately it's time to turn the stream off if you weren't here

1553
04:26:32,950 --> 04:26:39,909
earlier uh I'm shaving some time off of the streams this week to prepare for a couple things

1554
04:26:39,909 --> 04:26:44,950
Thanksgiving is going to be moved around a little bit because I'm streaming on Thanksgiving and I

1555
04:26:44,950 --> 04:26:53,190
have an upper endoscopy this week too so I need to I have to like go on a little bit of a changed

1556
04:26:53,190 --> 04:27:01,719
diet and I have some procedure shit to do so this week is a little busy I'm going to stream the next

1557
04:27:01,719 --> 04:27:06,920
three days in Rome streaming on Thanksgiving too but the streams are going to be like four to five

1558
04:27:06,920 --> 04:27:21,530
hours each so we're going to play I feel like I'm just getting into it now I've had an upper

1559
04:27:21,530 --> 04:27:26,969
endoscopy it's kind of neat well I had a colonoscopy a few months ago and we're going the other way

1560
04:27:26,969 --> 04:27:36,469
this time uh but so that's going to be the end here we're going to transition out to the bits

1561
04:27:36,469 --> 04:27:39,989
and everything see you tomorrow we're going to do the same thing to pick up right where you left

1562
04:27:39,989 --> 04:27:45,180
off right here I feel like I'm like I said I'm just getting barely into it now so bear with me

1563
04:27:45,180 --> 04:27:53,659
this week well um obviously holiday stuff and uh a medical procedure have to take some precedence so

1564
04:27:54,459 --> 04:28:01,610
streams will be shaved but I'll see you guys tomorrow I'm going to actually do a hard save

1565
04:28:01,610 --> 04:28:10,020
here because I have not done it once the whole game so that would be nice uh first impression so

1566
04:28:10,020 --> 04:28:22,780
far feels like feels like there's I this might I don't I don't know if this is a it might just

1567
04:28:22,780 --> 04:28:30,540
be talking complete bullshit here in the first few hours of the game but there it seems like

1568
04:28:30,540 --> 04:28:38,260
there there are I thought there weren't going to be that many interesting choices but seems like

1569
04:28:38,260 --> 04:28:46,389
there are I didn't mean killing the guy like that's something you can do seems like there's

1570
04:28:46,389 --> 04:28:50,790
a couple of optional things you can do for each major mission which is kind of interesting I guess

1571
04:28:52,760 --> 04:29:01,239
it does feel like it may have maybe if they had like an extra year or two it'd be expanded on but

1572
04:29:01,239 --> 04:29:12,649
I don't know yet I don't know we'll see but I am an inch I'm interested enough to play it again

1573
04:29:12,649 --> 04:29:27,159
tomorrow it's more limited than I was hoping for it just more fallout type choices yeah I'm like

1574
04:29:27,159 --> 04:29:31,239
it's kind of hard to pass judgment on a game like this in the first three or four hours

1575
04:29:31,959 --> 04:29:38,120
so a couple of interesting things just happened so well all right that's pretty fucking cool some

1576
04:29:38,120 --> 04:29:42,360
interesting developments you can kill this person you can kill that person you can do their mission

1577
04:29:42,360 --> 04:29:51,770
you can cut off the power you I mean that's cool but we'll see if it continues but I cannot

1578
04:29:51,770 --> 04:29:58,540
pass judgment on it yet I feel like it's too early but uh there you go that's kind of what I think

1579
04:30:01,530 --> 04:30:06,299
we'll see how I feel tomorrow I'll see you tomorrow let's transition to the bits

1580
04:30:07,180 --> 04:30:20,219
thanks for joining me everybody see you tomorrow have a great night same time same place you don't

1581
04:30:20,219 --> 04:30:24,540
play games you're just too terrible for it to count as playing I beat the last boss the last

1582
04:30:24,540 --> 04:30:31,059
true boss in Sekiro in under 100 tries just I mean I'm just gonna throw that out there

1583
04:30:31,620 --> 04:30:45,659
have you done that yet did you do that yet have you done that just I just need to know I actually

1584
04:30:45,659 --> 04:30:48,219
did that I mean yeah I'm not I'm not I'm talking to the one guy

1585
04:30:55,159 --> 04:31:07,670
under 100 omega lull I'll see you tomorrow uh let's do the bits let me quit out of here so

1586
04:31:07,670 --> 04:31:19,000
I can pull this over one omega I don't know why I go mega lull I just I think it's so funny

1587
04:31:20,010 --> 04:31:26,649
I love that emo because it's such it could it could be used legitimately or as a total

1588
04:31:26,649 --> 04:31:42,069
overreaction to anything it's great it has so many uses why is it funnier than lul I just

1589
04:31:43,350 --> 04:31:46,469
it's because it's supposed to there's a lot there's a lot of layers there

1590
04:31:52,379 --> 04:31:57,579
but anyways uh let's do the let's get the music rolling here thanks again for joining me thank

1591
04:31:57,579 --> 04:32:04,940
you sad vega for the 250 I thought we were calling the 2019 germa uh awards the germies

1592
04:32:05,899 --> 04:32:25,780
that's loud I'll turn it down uh the germies huh maybe I look forward to it though it's like I

1593
04:32:25,780 --> 04:32:34,170
I can't wait to see what the nominations could be it's it's just fun I can't wait

1594
04:32:36,629 --> 04:32:41,590
but that's not yet that's gonna happen second half obviously of December so we have a lot of

1595
04:32:41,590 --> 04:32:48,840
other things to think about first hey spunky spade thanks for the thousand bits if I give you

1596
04:32:48,920 --> 04:32:52,360
my bits will you leave my rats alone I have nothing to do with your rats

1597
04:32:53,690 --> 04:32:57,129
I'll take the thousand bits but I have nothing to do with those rats I didn't do anything to your

1598
04:32:57,129 --> 04:33:02,899
rats yes I will leave your rats alone because from the very beginning I was not I was leaving them

1599
04:33:02,899 --> 04:33:07,509
alone in the first place so you got your wish thanks for the thousand bits appreciate it

1600
04:33:07,509 --> 04:33:26,139
seriously uh wait does this work I say this every stream let's see if it worked it's always like

1601
04:33:26,220 --> 04:33:35,740
four streams behind I don't know why it doesn't make any sense doesn't work

1602
04:33:39,939 --> 04:33:42,900
thank you uh lights not on thanks to the 250

1603
04:33:44,380 --> 04:33:50,939
germa just a month ago I lost my iphone se and I heard your se ran at the end of the dead rising

1604
04:33:50,939 --> 04:33:57,419
stream rip both our se's I guess this tears in memory of them oh and it's lights not on

1605
04:33:58,299 --> 04:34:05,430
got it I got it I wish I could get a fucking as a brand new se sealed with no tracking device

1606
04:34:05,430 --> 04:34:20,150
bug on it it'd be amazing I wanted an se so bad and let's do the credits camera's not on right

1607
04:34:20,150 --> 04:34:32,409
in case it is it's not thank you all the subs welcome back to all of the long time subs and

1608
04:34:32,409 --> 04:34:43,139
welcome for the first time welcome for the first time all the new ones thanks something that needs

1609
04:34:43,139 --> 04:34:49,619
to be said about the Minecraft king stream this is very important and it's a decision that I did

1610
04:34:49,619 --> 04:34:57,400
not make lightly actually this is really really important kill the music for a second I don't

1611
04:34:57,400 --> 04:35:01,880
think I talked too much about this but of all the things that we talked about at the beginning of

1612
04:35:01,880 --> 04:35:08,279
the stream the thing that is absolutely number one for like true the for everything is set in

1613
04:35:08,279 --> 04:35:14,520
stone it's going to be a sub-only server with potential twitch integration like you need to

1614
04:35:14,520 --> 04:35:23,220
verify your twitch id and you have to be more than one month sub and the reason why we're

1615
04:35:23,220 --> 04:35:36,169
doing that is because Minecraft is probably the easiest video game on earth to fucking script

1616
04:35:36,169 --> 04:35:47,380
and destroy like a whole stream so it has to be that way we're it's going to be a multi-month sub

1617
04:35:47,380 --> 04:35:54,790
only and the reason why it has to be multi-month is because if it was just sub only somebody could

1618
04:35:54,790 --> 04:36:03,900
just sub and then come in and that's you know hey five dollars here you go take it I'm coming in

1619
04:36:06,889 --> 04:36:13,209
so just need to be we're going to try to protect the server in quotes I guess as best as we can

1620
04:36:14,520 --> 04:36:20,680
so that's the way that is absolutely set in stone but when there's still some bits to do

1621
04:36:22,900 --> 04:36:32,299
we have uh sad vega thanks for the 250 this is the best dumb rp playthrough I've ever seen

1622
04:36:32,299 --> 04:36:39,819
you really nailed the role of being an idiot down to full chat my character is not even stupid

1623
04:36:39,819 --> 04:36:47,849
though he's an engineer he's a medic he's a scientist and he's a liar you have to be smart

1624
04:36:47,849 --> 04:36:58,619
to lie well Freudian weapon thanks for the 250 no that's not that's not 250 it's 250 times

1625
04:36:58,619 --> 04:37:06,979
one two three four five thanks for the thousand bits Freudian uh appreciate the 10 bucks though

1626
04:37:06,979 --> 04:37:10,819
some choices you made may have infuriated me watching you play this was thoroughly entertaining

1627
04:37:11,540 --> 04:37:17,560
happy thanksgiving and good luck with the endoscopy I appreciate that thank you

1628
04:37:19,419 --> 04:37:28,889
the endoscopy is at the end of this week but for a few days before I infuriated for a few days before

1629
04:37:28,889 --> 04:37:35,450
the procedure I have to I can't eat certain foods and I have to kind of the day before

1630
04:37:35,450 --> 04:37:39,930
I can't eat anything well the night before whatever so I'm going to be all kind of trying

1631
04:37:39,930 --> 04:37:46,220
to change the way that I eat stuff and then obviously I'm going to be on drugs for the

1632
04:37:46,220 --> 04:37:54,360
procedures so I'm going to be kind of all over the place so that's uh it's all good though

1633
04:37:56,340 --> 04:38:02,279
only eat nuts and fruits uh oh you mean only nuts and fruits well from my understanding it's

1634
04:38:02,279 --> 04:38:11,319
anything that has skin on it no corn no peas no nuts no um fruits especially like berries

1635
04:38:11,959 --> 04:38:22,150
I just have to be careful no beans anytime I have a procedure like this I always kind of get a

1636
04:38:22,150 --> 04:38:28,549
little paranoid that I'm going to do something wrong I also don't I can't take any anti-inflammatory

1637
04:38:28,549 --> 04:38:33,430
medication like I can't take any uh like advil or something or aspirin I don't think just be

1638
04:38:33,430 --> 04:38:44,549
careful and it's the same the first time I've had to do something like this so it's not like

1639
04:38:44,549 --> 04:38:48,869
I'm nervous about it but you know anytime that you have anything like this going on you

1640
04:38:49,909 --> 04:38:55,110
anytime where I'm going to lie on a table and I'm going to get put unconscious and someone's going

1641
04:38:55,110 --> 04:39:02,939
to like do like things you know like medical I just get kind of like not nervous but obviously

1642
04:39:02,939 --> 04:39:09,180
it's understandable like I have to get put under so it's like I have to go under anesthesia and

1643
04:39:09,180 --> 04:39:16,299
have like a doctor fucking do like a scope so it just kind of creeps me out in a way you know

1644
04:39:25,720 --> 04:39:36,060
no that's the wrong music I'll see you tomorrow I feel the same I have arthritis and I've been

1645
04:39:36,060 --> 04:39:45,290
too been too tuned been too many times from my age yeah I just don't I don't like the anesthesia

1646
04:39:45,290 --> 04:39:52,360
drugs I just don't there's something about them just there's this chemical that they can put into

1647
04:39:52,360 --> 04:40:03,979
you that turns you off and then turns you back on it's uh this is it's just uh rubs me the wrong

1648
04:40:03,979 --> 04:40:20,580
way but you know you gotta do what you gotta do it was a huge medical breakthrough yeah it I mean

1649
04:40:20,580 --> 04:40:27,700
it absolutely is one of the most unbelievable discoveries of modern history is being able to

1650
04:40:28,419 --> 04:40:33,860
be able to go inside people and fix stuff without them even knowing you know other than

1651
04:40:33,860 --> 04:40:39,619
you knowing and obviously they know they're there but being that that I don't who the how the fuck

1652
04:40:39,619 --> 04:40:50,020
do you even come up with that how who what's the what's the process there to even figure that out

1653
04:40:52,790 --> 04:40:57,909
such remarkable medical and technological advances how did we come up with this shit

1654
04:40:57,909 --> 04:41:11,770
