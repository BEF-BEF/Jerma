1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:10,740
Viewers dropping. Is that someone who just wrote it in all capitals?

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:22,039
No, I think they're only going up from here. Oh shit, man. Viewers dropping.

3
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:35,590
That's so funny. Hey, how you doing, guys? I'm doing pretty good. I'm just hanging out with my...

4
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,590
a little bit of a messed up throat, but who cares? We got Chibi-Robo to play.

5
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:49,240
It's hard to say this. Chibi-Robo. I'm going to be playing this fun game called Chibi-Robo.

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:58,979
This was an expensive game. Looks pretty cool. The GameCube discs. I remember them.

7
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:06,870
They're very, very cool. These are a collector's item at this point. It's not in the...

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:15,370
Yeah, I'm playing it on a Wii. I know. Get over it. Not the original GameCube. That's fine.

9
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:25,560
But yeah, I've heard a lot of good things. I want to play Chibi-Robo. I'm into it.

10
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,560
I heard it's a game where you clean, you prepare food, and you use a dustpan and stuff.

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,799
I'm going to love this game. How am I not going to like this?

12
00:01:35,799 --> 00:02:37,000
But let me tweet this out, and we'll start in about two minutes.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,849
Alright, are you guys ready? I haven't done it yet. I'm not going to until we're ready.

14
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:52,280
The best part of the Wii is the fact that you can insert a GameCube disc at the top of the tray

15
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,280
or at the bottom of the tray, and it still figures out where it is.

16
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,860
Now that's some real technology. Alright, let's go.

17
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:14,240
Are you ready? It's going in. Should I show the disc first? Yeah, this is a big moment for us.

18
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:21,460
We're not getting married. But still, this is a big moment. First GameCube game.

19
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:35,900
Why should it not work? Ready? Look at this. Chibi-Robo.

20
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:45,789
Going in. No brace? No, not today. I'm trying to... I've got to relax it a little bit.

21
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:54,189
I've been wearing it too much. Here it goes. Another reason why I wanted to wait,

22
00:03:54,189 --> 00:04:01,129
because it's going to do the sound, right? Here it comes. Here it comes.

23
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:16,519
Okay, hold on. We've got to test something real quick.

24
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,519
Because this is a GameCube, so who knows if it's even going to work.

25
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,300
Are you going to tell me? Am I synced up? Is the sound synced up?

26
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:35,050
Start. We. Start. We. Start. We. Start. Get. Get. Get. Are we good?

27
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:52,889
Just got to make sure. No. The voice is hard to tell. Alright, are you ready?

28
00:04:52,889 --> 00:05:08,459
I'm going to do a circle. Circle. One, two, beep. It's good. No? It's fine.

29
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,759
He's completely naked. Alright, let's go. Chibi-Robo time. I'm ready.

30
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm ready. I've been looking forward to this for like a year at least.

31
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,699
What's going on? Oh, do you want to display the game in progressive scan mode?

32
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:31,889
Oh, fuck yeah. Are you serious? That's HD of 2004.

33
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:42,620
Warning. Important health. Before playing, read the health and safety book.

34
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:51,959
They did this for Chibi-Robo for the GameCube? Why? Do you have to move around?

35
00:05:56,269 --> 00:06:08,350
I already got cartoon clown sounds. Chibi-Robo. Oh, wow.

36
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:17,500
Alright, the screen might be a little... I might fix it a little off.

37
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:32,079
Looks alright. Can we adjust it? Why do I know what you're talking about?

38
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:40,529
This is...

39
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,529
Why do I know... I only have one...

40
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,529
Hold on, it's a little loud for me.

41
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:54,529
Why... I only have like one... I only have one barometer for what penis music is.

42
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,529
There's that one song. So of course I'm going to think that's what this is.

43
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,579
There it is!

44
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,579
Okay, I gotta turn it down. It's really loud.

45
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:12,839
Okay, that's at a decent volume. Actual wink.

46
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,839
Good, get them out because they're going away forever in like three days.

47
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:27,259
Turn off.

48
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:30,009
Wait, you need a memory card for the Wii?

49
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,009
I'm just fucking kidding.

50
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:37,860
Oh, wait, what about slot B?

51
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,860
It's in slot B! Why does it have to be in slot A?

52
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:59,120
Corrupted. What? Let's go.

53
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,089
Format. What are you talking about?

54
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:09,990
What do you mean the memory card is corrupted? It's been formatted.

55
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,990
The memory card slot A is corrupted.

56
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:21,939
What do you mean it's corrupted? Is this alright?

57
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:31,149
What the fuck are you talking about?

58
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:37,590
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

59
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:49,539
No, no, no, no, no, no. Just give me a second.

60
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,539
Why is the memory card corrupted?

61
00:08:51,539 --> 00:09:06,679
Is this like fucking... is this lying to me?

62
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:16,330
Hold on. My Wii just went...

63
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,629
Ah! Ah!

64
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:28,700
What the fuck is... I swear to God, there's a ghost that haunts me.

65
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,940
There's no way. There's no way.

66
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,940
I get haunted by a fucking ghost when I turn my stream on.

67
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,940
You guys understand how stupid this is? How insane this is.

68
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,940
I tested this before the stream turned on.

69
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,200
I literally did this like 35 seconds before the stream started.

70
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm haunted by a ghost. There's a ghost that's trying to kill me.

71
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,179
The memory card slot A must be formatted. Format it now.

72
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,250
Yes. If the memory card is formatted, all saved data will be erased.

73
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,490
Fucking do it!

74
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,669
Okay. Okay. Nintendo GameCube slots open.

75
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,669
20 out of 43.

76
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,129
From 2043.

77
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,129
Okay. Are we good? Is it okay?

78
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:16,129
Can I fucking play the game?

79
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:26,220
Okay. Let's go.

80
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,220
I have 2043 blocks of data.

81
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:36,860
Hey! Remember that sound?

82
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:50,990
No, no, no, no, no, no.

83
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,990
Apologize. Apologize. Apologize.

84
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,990
That sounded slightly like the thing that I don't like.

85
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:03,179
It is an animated character. I don't like them.

86
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,490
Okay. Can I... This is gonna be fine, right?

87
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,940
Put in health and safety instructions.

88
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,169
Licensed by Nintendo. Bandai.

89
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,169
This is before they became Bandai Namco.

90
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:18,299
Alright.

91
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,299
It's been formatted.

92
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:38,720
What do I do? What do I do?

93
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,240
Choose yes.

94
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,220
The memory card slot A has been formatted.

95
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
The memory card slot A is corrupted.

96
00:11:51,220 --> 00:12:00,820
I just did that because I had to.

97
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,279
Say yes. Say yes.

98
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
Just keep saying yes over and over again.

99
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:20,669
Blow on the memory card!

100
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,669
Blow on the memory card?

101
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,669
What? This is so sad.

102
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:45,409
I just... Why is...

103
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:47,409
512? What's wrong with that?

104
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:54,179
Alright. I pushed it in there like fucking hard.

105
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:13,360
Am I in slot B?

106
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I can't do slot B because slot B...

107
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
I'm...

108
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,519
I can't do slot B because it doesn't let me choose slot B.

109
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,519
My form has slot A?

110
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,220
Alright. What's it?

111
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,220
Alright. It's in slot B.

112
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Don't continue. Option.

113
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Scream into it.

114
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,580
Alright. Hold on.

115
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,820
So now...

116
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Bro, run to the store and buy a new memory card.

117
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,539
But the GameCube!

118
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,539
You want me to run to the store and get a

119
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,539
memory card for a console

120
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,539
that has been out of circulation for like

121
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,539
17 years!

122
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,779
You want me to run to the

123
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:19,970
store!

124
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,039
I'm going to...

125
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:34,620
I just want to play a game!

126
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,620
Wait a minute. Just don't say...

127
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
No! That's horrible!

128
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
I'll get it. No, I'm emulated!

129
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,620
This game was like a hundred

130
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,620
fucking dollars on eBay!

131
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,929
No! No, we're not emulating!

132
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,929
I have it! What a fucking

133
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,929
introduction!

134
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,929
Look at this! Oh! I can't wait to...

135
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,929
What can I say? Look!

136
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,929
Oh yeah! The GameCube disc!

137
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,929
Oh, remember? Oh, shh! Quiet!

138
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:00,929
Fucking joke.

139
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:06,750
I should have just fucking emulated the goddamn thing.

140
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,929
I should have just emulated literally everything.

141
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,929
Companies wonder why the fuck people do this shit.

142
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:14,259
I wonder why consumers

143
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:16,259
are downloading fake GameCube

144
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,259
game cards and ISOs.

145
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,259
No! It can't be!

146
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,259
It can't be because the shit don't work

147
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:55,340
when you're trying to use it for real!

148
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,950
What?!

149
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,950
It's right here! GameCube

150
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,950
slot A, slot B, it's right

151
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,950
fucking here! This shit works!

152
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,950
What? Oh!

153
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:16,340
I can't put it in slot A. Maybe the slot A

154
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,620
is corrupted? I don't... I had it in

155
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
slot A, we got to see the same image

156
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,720
in slot A. I don't...

157
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
You know what? I'm not

158
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
gonna turn the fucking stream off until I'm done with the game.

159
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
Let's go. I'm not spending

160
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
15 straight minutes on this nonsense.

161
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,590
I gotta remember to card in slot B.

162
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,590
I should be able to choose... God damn it.

163
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,409
Let's have a board meeting about what the

164
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:50,669
hell do people...

165
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:52,669
Correct me if I'm wrong, fellow

166
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,669
person...

167
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:56,669
People are downloading

168
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,669
the video games and they're playing them without our

169
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:00,669
permission. Is there a reason

170
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,669
why people are doing this without

171
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:04,670
my permission?

172
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,819
Just like, play this VOD

173
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,819
to that person.

174
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,819
I actually don't know anything. I just

175
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,819
watched. I don't know what that means either.

176
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,819
I've never played a video game, so

177
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,250
it's lost on me.

178
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:36,420
You just talked over the GameCube

179
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
setup. How to fix a corrupted GameCube

180
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:46,480
memory card. What?

181
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Power off the console, remove the card,

182
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
replace it, see if the message comes back, save

183
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
any files that aren't corrupted.

184
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Leave the card alone. Place the card

185
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
away from anything electronic

186
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
for a week.

187
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Hold on.

188
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Hold on. No.

189
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Excuse me.

190
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Look at this.

191
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Are you trying to tell me that this

192
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,730
is a real website?

193
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,730
This is a copypasta of the streamer I

194
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,730
met the streamer at.

195
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,289
Fucking Walgreens.

196
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:22,289
Leave the card alone. Place the card away from

197
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,289
anything electronic for about a week.

198
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,289
The lack of electromagnetic interference could help

199
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:41,900
fix the card. Huh?

200
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
This can only be done on a GameCube

201
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
console. If these steps

202
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
don't work, it must be reformatted. It can only be done on

203
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,339
a GameCube console.

204
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:56,339
Let's go. Fucking TV

205
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,339
robot. I'm ready. There's no card in slot A.

206
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,339
Who cares?

207
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,339
Continue without saving. I'll

208
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:05,220
find a way. Hey,

209
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,779
chibi-robo. I can pick slot B

210
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:21,339
when I save the game. I guarantee it.

211
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,130
Happy birthday, Jenny.

212
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,130
Here you go. I got you this hat as a special

213
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,180
present from me.

214
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
I see a coin. I see a coin. I see a coin.

215
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:45,380
That's all I care about.

216
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,519
Don't like it? What's wrong?

217
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,519
Jenny, you're eight now. You can't run

218
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,519
in a frog costume all day. You need a real

219
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,140
hat.

220
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,140
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

221
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,140
Oh, Jenny.

222
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Woof, woof.

223
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:15,940
Ruff, ruff.

224
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
Oh, I got a present

225
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,940
for her too. Do you, Tau?

226
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,940
I got a present for her too.

227
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,460
Do you, Tau? Dog has a

228
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
present? It's a bow!

229
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,640
Woof.

230
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Wow, good dog. How did you ruff it?

231
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,470
Ribbit, ribbit.

232
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,470
Another 3D movie maker family.

233
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,470
All right, now it's my turn.

234
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,160
You're just going to love

235
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
my gift, Jenny.

236
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,990
Yeah, right.

237
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,990
By the way, what an interesting

238
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,990
t-shirt. It just says the three on it.

239
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,130
Don't you want that shirt?

240
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,900
What is that? You know we can't afford

241
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
it. Jenny

242
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,720
says she wanted one.

243
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,660
Ribbit. Oh, honey, you're not

244
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,660
fooling anyone. You only wanted one for yourself.

245
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,660
Is this a chibi robo?

246
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
The latest and greatest in household

247
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,660
robots?

248
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,220
We'll talk about this later.

249
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,779
What do you think, Jenny?

250
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,779
Do you love it? You love it, right?

251
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,500
Uh, Jenny's not

252
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,700
communicating.

253
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:46,059
My eyes?

254
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,059
Damn.

255
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,059
Get ready, chibi robo. It's almost

256
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,839
showtime. This is when I get out

257
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,660
and I'm going to be like, look at me!

258
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I'm going to be like, look at me!

259
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,619
They're talking like sims,

260
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:07,180
but scary.

261
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
What do you think? Should I flip the switch?

262
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,839
Let's do it.

263
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,839
The movie's with Azadjara Taylor.

264
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,910
All right, get ready to

265
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,910
Azadjara robo.

266
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,109
Ratchet, ratchet. We got it.

267
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:37,900
Holy shit, it really is going on.

268
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:54,079
This is quite an introduction.

269
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,079
I can't wait to get the coin on the counter.

270
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,750
Yay, chibi robo.

271
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,259
Hello, hello.

272
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,690
Hello there.

273
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,569
Ribbit.

274
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:14,000
Arf.

275
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,299
We're here to make you happy.

276
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,299
I'm Telly and this is chibi robo.

277
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,299
Amazing!

278
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,299
Ribbit.

279
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,299
Woof.

280
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,299
Oh!

281
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,299
Hey, is this a birthday party?

282
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,299
You got that right.

283
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:33,980
Uh-oh, chibi robo.

284
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,980
It looks like we've come to the party empty-handed.

285
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,420
We need to find a present

286
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,420
for Jenny and fast.

287
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,299
Is this a children's game?

288
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,720
Oh. How about that flower,

289
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,369
chibi robo?

290
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:55,700
No. No.

291
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,940
Really? Are you sure?

292
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,940
I think it's perfect for Jenny.

293
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,259
No. I don't like,

294
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:08,259
I don't want to give that present.

295
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:10,259
Really? Are you sure? I think it's perfect

296
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:12,259
for Jenny. Oh, we're getting forced

297
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:14,259
into saying yes. Okay.

298
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:16,259
Yes, I do agree with you.

299
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,140
I'll leave the rest to you, chibi robo.

300
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,140
Whoa, the game just got way louder.

301
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,339
I have a big plug on my

302
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:27,410
back? Uh, chibi robo,

303
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,410
don't get that plug in any

304
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,410
water or any food.

305
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,410
Chibi, don't dunk the end

306
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,410
of the plug into the orange juice.

307
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,759
Alright, let's get it. How do I jump?

308
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:48,779
What?

309
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,779
They didn't tell me how to move.

310
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:53,730
So loud.

311
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,759
Jenny!

312
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:04,910
Alright, let's get it. I got it.

313
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,049
Okay, rose.

314
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,289
That fits in there?

315
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,099
Hot.

316
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:17,069
That's awesome.

317
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,190
Excellent. Chibi robo,

318
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,190
chibi robo. You should try using

319
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,430
your chibi copter.

320
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,430
It comes standard in all chibi robo models.

321
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,430
All you have to do is equip it.

322
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,430
You can't fly upwards with it, but

323
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,609
listen to this.

324
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,609
You can use it to slowly fall from high

325
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:44,609
places. That way you won't hurt this fall

326
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,099
damage. Press X to open the

327
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,369
equip screen.

328
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:52,369
Tilt left or right to select the chibi copter

329
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:54,369
and then press A to equip it.

330
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:57,630
It's on my go-go gadget.

331
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,829
Oh, and if you hold down A, you'll hover

332
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,829
horizontally for a short time.

333
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,829
It's handy when you want to fly over small gaps

334
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,069
or drop from high places. Hey,

335
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,069
listen up, chibi robo.

336
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,069
Use the chibi copter, okay?

337
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,140
I don't want you to take a nasty fall.

338
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,140
Alright, you've made it very clear.

339
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,829
Press B to put the copter away.

340
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:33,170
Okay, so that's it.

341
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,170
This toy sucks.

342
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,170
Imagine getting this on Christmas.

343
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,170
Oh, wow.

344
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,170
That's really cool.

345
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:50,769
Yes, I was trying to dunk the thing

346
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:52,769
in the orange juice. Alright, good.

347
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:57,740
Now what? Hurry up and give that

348
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,099
flower to- oh. Come here.

349
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:04,099
I got a flower for you.

350
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:10,880
I think Mrs. Sanderson made

351
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
this cake. You can't eat anything

352
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
anyway, chibi robo.

353
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,440
Oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt

354
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,680
your feelings. Oh.

355
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,980
If you move next to an object and you see

356
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,980
the exclamation icon, press

357
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,019
A. I just did.

358
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:31,730
What feelings?

359
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,740
Oh, right. It's a robot.

360
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:47,859
Do I have to float over there?

361
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,740
Coin behind turkey? Oh, shit.

362
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:59,940
Got it.

363
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,940
What about the turkey? Looks like

364
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940
chicken is on the menu tonight.

365
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Chicken. That's a word that brings back some

366
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
really bad memories from me.

367
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,519
Oh, but maybe now isn't the time to talk about

368
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,680
that. What? Alright, we gotta float

369
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,420
over there. Take out the helicopter.

370
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,099
Let's go. Here we go. Float onto

371
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,920
the cake. On cake.

372
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,930
Here we go. Give rose.

373
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:32,819
I think Mrs.

374
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,819
can't eat anything anyway. How do I give the rose?

375
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:42,430
Do I have to equip it?

376
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,250
Wait. Frog ring?

377
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:52,420
I'm looking through my eyes.

378
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,740
Alright, how do I give you the-

379
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
I already did that.

380
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,500
Was I not close? Alright.

381
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
I tried to do that before. I guess I wasn't close enough.

382
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,460
Chibi Robo, give the rose to Jenny.

383
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,329
Yes.

384
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:22,750
Here you go.

385
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,750
This game is cute. It looks very cute.

386
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,339
You got 20 happy

387
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:31,019
points. Are they sad

388
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,019
points? And you got 120-

389
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:35,019
I don't know. What is that?

390
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:41,170
What kind of currency is that?

391
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:46,289
Spread the happiness.

392
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:48,289
Earn happy points in

393
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:50,289
Moolah by making people happy.

394
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,289
Of course, earning lots of happy points

395
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,289
will raise your Chibi Robo ranking.

396
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:56,289
Let's do our best to get you into

397
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:58,910
first place. Are there

398
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,910
items in the house?

399
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,880
Now for Jenny to blow out the candles. Do I have to compete

400
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
with the vacuum cleaner? And the

401
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:14,299
Lysol? Or what?

402
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:17,809
One. Two.

403
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:21,390
Yeah. Although I can't-

404
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,390
I really can't agree with their use of

405
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,390
candles on the cake. Blow it out on the cake.

406
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,390
That's disgusting. Now nobody wants to eat the cake because

407
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,390
the little kids spit all over the cake.

408
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,390
And what I'd like

409
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,390
to see is

410
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,630
a separate cupcake that has

411
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,630
a candle on it. You blow

412
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,630
the two or three candles on one little cupcake.

413
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,630
They blow them all over

414
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,630
the cupcake. Okay, cool. Now the cake is fine. Everyone can

415
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:49,900
eat it. Go to work, Chibi Robo.

416
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:55,660
You looked a bit

417
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,660
nervous at first, but you came through like a pro.

418
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,609
Put plastic over the cake?

419
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,609
Why would you-

420
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:05,869
Now listen, we need to make ourselves useful

421
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:07,869
to the Sandersons, right?

422
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:09,869
Okay.

423
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,869
Let's adjust your happy point total.

424
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,869
But it gets adjusted?

425
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:17,009
Your Chibi

426
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,009
ranking has gone from

427
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,380
1 million to

428
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,380
782 thousand. Why did I lose

429
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
happy points?

430
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,380
Oh, I'm gaining, right.

431
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,730
I'm gaining rank.

432
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,730
Get out there and earn a ton of happy points and

433
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,730
grab yourself the top Chibi ranking.

434
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,730
When you reach top

435
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,900
Chibi ranking, why

436
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
you'll be upgraded

437
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
to Super Chibi Robo.

438
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,980
Take it from me, TeleVision.

439
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,119
Ah, that's a good name. I'll do what I can

440
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,599
to lend you a hand. You can count on me.

441
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,250
TeleVision.

442
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,509
Professor E. Gadd.

443
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,509
Yes, I would love to save the game.

444
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,509
I would love to. And I'd like to do it in slot

445
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:35,539
B. Fuck.

446
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:39,740
Let's go.

447
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
I can't pick the slot.

448
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,819
Really, I can't.

449
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:46,819
Oh, this is so cool and cute.

450
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:52,509
Hold on. Can I not?

451
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,509
Yes, I want to save.

452
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,509
God damn it.

453
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,690
This is an ungrounded outlet.

454
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I would like to save.

455
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,619
God damn it.

456
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:27,059
Okay.

457
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:39,259
I don't know what to do.

458
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,259
I don't know what to do.

459
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:43,259
I know what I have to do,

460
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:45,259
which is unfortunate. I have to either beat the whole game in one

461
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,259
stream,

462
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,259
or I have to leave the fucking

463
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:51,259
Wii turned on and on overnight.

464
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:56,579
This is literally a two stream game.

465
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:59,329
God damn it.

466
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,259
Amazon one day

467
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:08,260
shipping.

468
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,260
Can I do Amazon same day?

469
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,880
Oh.

470
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,980
Please. Please.

471
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:24,400
No.

472
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:31,820
God damn it.

473
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:41,150
This is bad.

474
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,150
The game is upwards of like 14 hours.

475
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,420
How long is the game?

476
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,059
How long is the game?

477
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:54,860
Blow into the port. 12 to 15 hours?

478
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,449
About 12 hours?

479
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:01,010
12 to 20 hours?

480
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,550
Okay.

481
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,550
It takes 15 hours to beat this game on a speedrun.

482
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,550
I don't believe that. I'm going to blow in the port.

483
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:25,940
We're going to try everything.

484
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,940
Make sure it's got good contact with the receptacles.

485
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,300
Good contact.

486
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,550
Good. I just like got it in there.

487
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,139
Good contact.

488
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:42,530
Let's try it again.

489
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,070
Just pretend you're not streaming

490
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,949
to the ghost leaves.

491
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:51,949
You just spit all over the cake. It's going to be alright.

492
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,949
I know. I know.

493
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:55,949
But happy points. Fuck.

494
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:58,190
Save the game. Come on. Right here.

495
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:12,530
Let's go. I just got good contact.

496
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:18,030
I had this problem before.

497
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,030
You literally have to smack it against something hard.

498
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,030
Like with a fucking hammer?

499
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,340
I need to hit my

500
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,340
GameCube memory card

501
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,340
with a hammer. Is that what you're telling me to do?

502
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,340
Hit it with a fucking hammer.

503
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,340
Are you serious? No.

504
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:38,349
That's not. It's true.

505
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:53,440
Shake it?

506
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:02,849
This is not doing anything.

507
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:05,469
Like go shake it.

508
00:37:05,469 --> 00:37:41,119
Smack it around.

509
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,119
Save the game.

510
00:37:43,119 --> 00:38:04,239
Yes, I would. Yes.

511
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,239
Leave the free turned on. That's so bad.

512
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,239
It looks good. Oh, I'm so fucking sad.

513
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:14,829
Leave the free turned on.

514
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:23,920
One last thing.

515
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,460
One last thing.

516
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:40,420
I'm going to try one last fucking thing.

517
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,619
I'm going to close it into the door.

518
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,619
He's going to get a hammer. MonkaS.

519
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,619
No, I'm not going to get a fucking hammer. I'm not stupid.

520
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:52,219
I'm not going to go get a fucking hammer.

521
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:54,219
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to close it into the closet.

522
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:58,110
Look.

523
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,929
I'm not naked. Don't worry.

524
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:02,929
I do have my nails already long so I can relax.

525
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,929
I don't want you to see the secret stash of GameCube games though.

526
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:06,929
Whatever.

527
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:14,210
Stay right there.

528
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:34,739
See in here?

529
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,980
See that?

530
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,980
It's in there right now. It's literally inside of here.

531
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,980
It's right there.

532
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
Can you see the GameCube?

533
00:39:42,980 --> 00:40:13,179
Memory card?

534
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:18,940
Not harder. That's a bad idea.

535
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:37,360
Here we go. It's in.

536
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
It's not going to fucking do anything.

537
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
It's not going to work.

538
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
It's not going to happen.

539
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
This thing is fucked up.

540
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
I'm going to Amazon same day a fucking memory card.

541
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,780
What time is it?

542
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,780
Just turn off the Wii completely and unplug it.

543
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,780
What?

544
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
I already did that. I can't.

545
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:04,050
Turn the Wii off.

546
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,050
No. I guess we didn't do that much.

547
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,440
Should I try turning the Wii off?

548
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Alright. You ready? Okay. Here we go.

549
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,829
Turn the Wii off?

550
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:16,829
No. Yes. No. Just neutralize.

551
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:18,829
What? Turn it upside down.

552
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:20,829
No. Yes. Make him go to GameStop.

553
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,829
No. You can't buy these anywhere.

554
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:28,269
It's alright.

555
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,269
I'm going to do one more fucking thing.

556
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:32,269
If this doesn't work, then fuck it.

557
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:34,269
I'm going to have to just play.

558
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:39,650
You have to restart the game.

559
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,590
You have to turn it off.

560
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,409
Hold on.

561
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:50,659
It was just a dumb tutorial.

562
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:53,150
We can wait. Buy a new one.

563
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,150
It's right here. Hold on.

564
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,150
I'm going to format the card in the Wii menu.

565
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,150
Turn the console off. Turn it back on.

566
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,719
Alright. That's the plan.

567
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,179
Right? Is that the way that I need to try?

568
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:11,820
It's not going to work?

569
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,820
No. Reset your Wi-Fi.

570
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,820
Reformat the card.

571
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,090
Hold on. Stop talking.

572
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,519
Nobody talk.

573
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:27,730
Stop talking.

574
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,730
Restart the console and a little warning should come up at the start.

575
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,730
The last thing the card needs to be formatted.

576
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,099
Reformat the card.

577
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:36,099
The card must be reformatted. This can only be done in a GameCube console.

578
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:38,099
All the data in the card must be deleted.

579
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,099
Restart the console and a little warning should come up.

580
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,340
This is the Wii.

581
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,559
Yes.

582
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:48,559
This reformatted card will work again

583
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,659
with both the GameCube and the Wii.

584
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:56,369
I need a GameCube to do this.

585
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:10,820
I already did this.

586
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,449
I'm just going to leave the fucking Wii on.

587
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:18,449
Guys, there's definitely no such thing as an Amazon

588
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:20,449
same day delivery for a GameCube

589
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:31,780
memory card.

590
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:37,789
I'm going to leave the fucking Wii turned on?

591
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:44,380
Same hour delivery.

592
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,380
What happens if I lose without a save file?

593
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,460
Leave the stream on too.

594
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,460
Alright. Well, I don't think so.

595
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,460
This is not a game where you like lose and die

596
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,460
and go to game over. I don't think so.

597
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,099
Call GameStop?

598
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:08,099
Guys, they're closing GameStops everywhere.

599
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:16,480
No one's going in them.

600
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
It just needs to be an SD card. How's that going to fit

601
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:26,929
in the top slot?

602
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:28,929
Oh, Mr. Sanderson. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

603
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:30,929
He had a little too much fun at the party.

604
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:32,929
I think he passed out from excitement.

605
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:36,829
It goes in the front slot. Yeah, for the Wii

606
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:38,829
you need a GameCube memory card to be able to save

607
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:40,829
GameCube games. The Wii is just

608
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:43,519
a GameCube. It's like the same hardware.

609
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:45,519
They just made it a little faster. Look, I've done

610
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:52,300
my research. Don't worry. It is. No, it isn't.

611
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,300
It is. And people that don't know that, the Wii

612
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,300
is just a GameCube with a new shell

613
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
that they made a little bit faster.

614
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,300
That's the truth. Go look it up right now. I want you to

615
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,300
look it up so you go, oh fuck, he was right. Holy shit.

616
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,719
SD cards work?

617
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,539
No, they don't. No, they don't because it's not going

618
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:11,539
to read that in slot A or B for

619
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:13,539
the GameCube. Trust me, I did my research.

620
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:20,960
Here's what's going to happen, okay?

621
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
I'm going to Amazon next

622
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
day for tomorrow, a new memory card.

623
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,500
The Wii is going to stay on.

624
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Tomorrow morning when, you know,

625
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
here's the new memory card, I'm going

626
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:40,849
to put it in and save the game.

627
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:46,719
You'll see a sun symbol during the

628
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,719
day and the moon symbol at night.

629
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:50,719
The moon is out right now, so that means it's night

630
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,500
time. What if that card is corrupted,

631
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
dude? If that doesn't work

632
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
then I'm just going to play it.

633
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,940
It'll be on still.

634
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,940
And plus, I'm going to just fucking beat the game tonight.

635
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:12,590
Oh my god, I'm cleaning

636
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:15,469
up. Proper trash.

637
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:17,469
Always put refuse in a

638
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:21,380
proper receptacle.

639
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:26,110
Holy shit, I get to clean up?

640
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:31,940
Wow, unbelievable.

641
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,480
What's over here? This is trash.

642
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,480
Candy wrapper. Always put

643
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,480
refuse in a proper receptacle.

644
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,300
We get to pick up

645
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,300
trash. Oh, I love this game.

646
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,300
I'm so glad I can save it

647
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,300
with my fucking memory card that doesn't work.

648
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:58,699
Make sure to save your progress.

649
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:01,070
Yeah, it's called

650
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,070
leave the Wii turned on until I can

651
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,070
somehow get a memory card here

652
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,949
overnight. Coins?

653
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:21,199
When was the last time you saved?

654
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:27,860
Good question.

655
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,860
Well, that's why it doesn't make any sense because when I

656
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,860
reformatted on the Wii menu

657
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,349
it's like, oh, here you go.

658
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:36,349
2,043 blocks. And then I

659
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:38,349
turn this on and it's like, this thing's fucked up.

660
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:47,679
I can't use this.

661
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,349
I'm going to get whatever this is. Can I pull

662
00:47:52,349 --> 00:48:01,500
this out? Oh, there we go.

663
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,130
Is it Amazon, I think?

664
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,010
Hold on, wait, wait.

665
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,010
Impatible for Wii GameCube.

666
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,010
I already, this is one of the, I bought one

667
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,699
of these. Free

668
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:16,059
one day

669
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,139
delivery. Alright, everyone, hold on.

670
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:21,380
Nobody move.

671
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:33,329
Free one day delivery.

672
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:35,329
He wants to put a two year protection

673
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,329
plan.

674
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:43,659
Sure.

675
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,659
I'll take a two year protection.

676
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:47,659
Should have bought the two year protection plan.

677
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:56,369
I'm losing power. Oh, shit, I am.

678
00:48:56,369 --> 00:49:00,019
Hold on, pause again. Fuckin' joke.

679
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:04,690
Alright, let me, let me see.

680
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:10,449
Hold on, I'm buying something.

681
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:15,949
Hold on, I'm purchasing something. Give me

682
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:22,420
a sec. Tomorrow.

683
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:28,110
One day delivery.

684
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,110
Nah, this, yeah, I mean, but I, what

685
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,110
am I going to do? I have to get one for tomorrow.

686
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:39,340
Alright, fuck it.

687
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:46,510
Okay. Tomorrow night.

688
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,510
Beat it in one play through.

689
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,750
We have to, actually, we have to

690
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:56,380
test something. We have to test to see

691
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,380
if I like jump off a cliff and die.

692
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:03,570
Alright, what happens? I got a frog card.

693
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:09,460
We explodes.

694
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,460
It loads the last

695
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,460
save. We need to test it because

696
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,460
if that's the case, then I, I have to

697
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,460
like do something else today.

698
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:31,900
Does that hurt? You're playing hardcore

699
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,380
mode. You get sent back to

700
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,380
the chibi house. Don't worry. Okay. Alright.

701
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:45,230
Cookie crumbs.

702
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:51,630
So that actually is my power. So I have to plug

703
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:57,780
in. Why, why does every step have to

704
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:09,550
be another note? Get the

705
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,550
get the Jerma branded memory card.

706
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,550
Why the fuck is this? This is stupid.

707
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,110
You got two thousand forty

708
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:18,110
three blocks open. Okay, cool.

709
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,110
Just kidding. The whole thing is corrupted. You can't use it.

710
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,340
Goodbye.

711
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,820
It's a red bubble

712
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:33,550
memory card. Glad he had

713
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,550
a good time. Oh.

714
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,550
Walking around drains your battery.

715
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:39,550
Keep an eye on your energy.

716
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,550
If your battery starts to run out, plug into an outlet

717
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:46,610
and recharge. Oh, that's cool. What is

718
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,780
this thing? Is it combat?

719
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,050
Dear diary, tonight I'm in my usual

720
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,050
spot and the living room body

721
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,050
in the kitchen.

722
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,119
Pound neglected me again. Typical.

723
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:01,190
He usually drops me right over there.

724
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:05,030
But tonight he was lazy and now

725
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,030
I and now I can watch Drake

726
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:10,039
while he patrols. Oh, it's so

727
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:12,039
hard to watch him that knight in shiny armor.

728
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:16,579
Oh, Drake.

729
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:18,579
I'm sorry. I didn't see you. Perhaps you are

730
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:20,579
on love patrol.

731
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:23,210
Oh,

732
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:28,119
oh, those pupils.

733
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:30,360
Are you looking at my diary?

734
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,360
Stop it. Oh, what a cad.

735
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,730
Oh, who are you?

736
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:41,880
Hey, now what's all the racket?

737
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,880
Oh, what in the? That toy is talking.

738
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,659
That's just how things work in this house.

739
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:49,659
Isn't that how it works everywhere?

740
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:51,829
Really? Well, that's a bit of a shocker.

741
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:53,829
So I take it there are other toys.

742
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:56,780
How rude of me. My name is Television

743
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,780
and this is Chibi Robo.

744
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:04,010
My name is Sophie.

745
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,010
Well, we're pleased as punch to meet you.

746
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:09,780
I was just writing in my diary and I thought

747
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,780
you were trying to peek. You scared me.

748
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,599
No worries. Happens all the time. Chibi

749
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,599
Robo small, so it's easy for him to sneak up

750
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:19,030
on you. Please allow me to apologize

751
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,030
on his behalf. We're both sorry we startled

752
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,460
you. Well, as long as you didn't

753
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,460
read about my secret passionate love for

754
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,460
Drake Redcrest, it's fine.

755
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,280
Hey, why doesn't Chibi Robo apologize

756
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,539
himself? Oh, man.

757
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:36,230
Apologizing is a vital

758
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,230
component of the manager's work.

759
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,659
You're his manager? Seriously?

760
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:42,659
Oh, that's kind of weird.

761
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:44,659
Hold on. I need to record this moment so I don't

762
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:47,929
forget. I'm being mocked

763
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:50,940
right now. If I was in the diary, this

764
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,940
could be a while. I guess I'll be leaving.

765
00:53:52,940 --> 00:54:00,039
Can I pick anything? What else can I do?

766
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:02,539
Anything else with you? Manager.

767
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,539
I've never heard the word in real life

768
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:06,539
before, but it sounds very important.

769
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,539
Chibi Robo and Tele seem very

770
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:10,539
close. It's nice to see good

771
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,969
friends like that. Also, Drake is

772
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:14,969
patrolling the area again. I love the way

773
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:16,969
his big boots clump around. It's so manly.

774
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:22,409
If Drake does his pose right

775
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:24,409
in front of me, I think I'll have to run away.

776
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:27,219
I'd be so embarrassed.

777
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,099
What the fuck is going on?

778
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:39,360
Are you trying to peek at my diary again?

779
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:46,019
God, you're a big creepo,

780
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:52,860
Chibi Robo.

781
00:54:52,860 --> 00:55:03,739
More trash. Let's get it. Why, this is something

782
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:05,739
already plugged in. Can I unplug this?

783
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:14,690
Or I can climb it. I can climb up

784
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:30,369
that cord. What is that? Record player.

785
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:34,139
Should I jump off and die?

786
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:36,139
To make sure? What do you think?

787
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:41,380
Let's turn this on first.

788
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,860
It's a little box? What's in the box?

789
00:55:45,860 --> 00:56:01,860
Wait, you can pull. Should I not have done that?

790
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:07,420
Why is it playing, like, drunk

791
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:12,780
music?

792
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,780
I want to pick this up.

793
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:23,039
Can I move this?

794
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,039
Waste time, though. Saving is only used when

795
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:27,039
loading from the main menu. You're fine if you never

796
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:29,860
close the game.

797
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,860
What does that mean? S?

798
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,860
S.

799
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:38,719
Chibi Robo?

800
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:40,719
Way to go. I think we can call it a day. I'm proud of the work

801
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:43,090
we've done. Well, the night has ended.

802
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,090
Let's return to the Chibi house.

803
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:56,800
Good morning.

804
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Your Chibi ranking is still 782,000.

805
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,800
In order to get the next

806
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
bonus battery, you need 60 more happy points.

807
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,800
Get out there and earn more happy

808
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
so that you have to be in bed

809
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
during the day. Let's go.

810
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
Well, stop doing that. You're making

811
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,800
trash.

812
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,800
Would you like to save? Yeah, I would.

813
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:22,670
Wii options, data management, save data,

814
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,670
Nintendo GameCube. I already did

815
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,670
that. We saw that

816
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,670
it was actually working. And there

817
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,670
were blocks open. I've done that twice.

818
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,670
He's not going to work.

819
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:43,090
Let's get out here.

820
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:48,530
Living room. Let's go.

821
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,530
Alright, we're going to make happy points.

822
00:57:50,530 --> 00:58:01,460
What's under here?

823
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:07,730
Oh, coins. I gotta climb that.

824
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:14,960
Get the trash. I thought that was

825
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,960
a Pepe face for a second. I was like, what the fuck?

826
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:25,460
Alright, let's go up.

827
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,460
Oh, I have a helicopter, don't I?

828
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,019
Okay, let's get that out.

829
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:33,599
Nice. Alright, put it away.

830
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,480
I'll just clean up after Dad?

831
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:43,309
Wink?

832
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:50,800
Alright, I gotta clean up after Dad's mess.

833
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:56,500
Alright, good.

834
00:59:02,019 --> 00:59:04,260
Just go get a lot of happy points, okay?

835
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,070
Hell, I'm trying to

836
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,250
pick up the trash.

837
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,380
Take this cheese crumb.

838
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,800
Save their marriage.

839
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800
Alright, we're doing a trash run

840
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,260
first, that's important. Candy bag.

841
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,260
Yep, into the trash.

842
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,360
Go marry his

843
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,920
wife. That's not how

844
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,630
that works.

845
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:39,260
Alright, what about

846
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,570
over here? Can I fly that far?

847
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:45,730
Clean up the couch

848
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,730
though, that's alright. Keep your batteries

849
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,730
running low. Oh, fuck.

850
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,289
Your body flashes red. Plug into an outlet, quick.

851
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:57,409
Where's the outlets in this god damn

852
00:59:57,409 --> 01:00:00,989
house? I need an outlet

853
01:00:00,989 --> 01:00:06,050
right now. Where are your outlets?

854
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:14,300
Where the fuck is any of your stuff

855
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:20,639
plugged in? There we go.

856
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:26,130
Is this a fake outlet?

857
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:56,829
Ugh.

858
01:00:56,829 --> 01:00:58,829
You have 80% iPhone battery.

859
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:02,670
Alright, let's go.

860
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:07,150
More coins. Are those happy coins?

861
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:09,150
Or are they regular coins? Alright, I want to do

862
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,900
uh, what do I want to do?

863
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,849
Here's my house. Alright, can I get like a bird's

864
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:16,849
eye view? I guess I can look. Wait, wait, there's

865
01:01:16,849 --> 01:01:18,849
trash under there. Where's the trash can?

866
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:24,099
Move

867
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:29,599
faster with the plug.

868
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:36,769
I give it the trash. It's you?

869
01:01:36,769 --> 01:01:38,769
What? No, it's not.

870
01:01:38,769 --> 01:01:45,550
It says put it in the proper

871
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:48,300
receptacle. Wait, am I the

872
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,250
trash? Am I the trash

873
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,250
can? No, there's a trash can over

874
01:01:53,250 --> 01:02:00,610
here, right? No, I'm definitely not

875
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:08,800
the trash. There's trash right

876
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,769
here, right? That's trash can.

877
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:16,989
Lob it in with A. What?

878
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:19,300
Oh, nice.

879
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,690
That's right, you can also get happy points by

880
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,690
throwing garbage away. Look at

881
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:31,280
all the trash I have. I picked up

882
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,570
a ton of stuff. Look at all the cheese I

883
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:38,000
got. You got a total of 31

884
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
happy points. You got

885
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,239
310 bucks. Nice.

886
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:44,239
All right, it's almost time to go to bed. Let's get some more

887
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:56,590
trash. This is a janitor game?

888
01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:13,619
It's my favorite kind of game. You can

889
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:16,110
use an SD card? How

890
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,110
difficult is it to use? I have an SD card

891
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,110
somewhere in this house.

892
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:22,110
How difficult is that to do?

893
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,110
Is that like hard to set that

894
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,110
up? No, you can't.

895
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:28,110
Why am I being lied to?

896
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:30,110
I can't throw it from here? Wow.

897
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:46,820
It has to be modded.

898
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,820
That's

899
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,820
way out of my

900
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:54,340
jurisdiction.

901
01:03:54,340 --> 01:04:02,980
What about the girl?

902
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,980
Just jailbreak your console.

903
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,150
I feel like that's a day project.

904
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,150
You don't have to be like an all day project.

905
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:17,340
I'm going to jailbreak my Wii today.

906
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:23,739
It takes 20 minutes for

907
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:29,250
you. Plus, how am I ever going to

908
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,250
send it back for an official Nintendo

909
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,150
warranty inspection, guys?

910
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:38,610
Ribbit ribbit.

911
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:40,610
Can I do anything with this?

912
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,260
Should I get the frog coins?

913
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,559
Speaking of coins. All right, it's almost time for bed.

914
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:57,300
I got money this time.

915
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:04,019
I'm leaving her hanging. Ribbit ribbit.

916
01:05:04,019 --> 01:05:07,730
She just goes

917
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,730
and just eats you.

918
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:16,059
I can draw ribbit.

919
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:19,519
Jenny just gave you 13 happy

920
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:21,519
points. Spread the happiness.

921
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:26,449
Drop it.

922
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:30,269
What are you going to draw?

923
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:33,920
Can I help? All right.

924
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,820
I got to get up here.

925
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:47,300
I got to climb on top of the coffee table.

926
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,300
13 happy points. It's nothing.

927
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,300
Look at all the shit that's up there. I want to get up here.

928
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,300
How much time do I have?

929
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,260
Am I going to PAX? I'm not

930
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,630
going to PAX. I will not

931
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:01,630
be at PAX. Uh oh. Time's up.

932
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:04,130
Get the trash quick.

933
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:09,119
Aww.

934
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,119
Chibi Robo. Time sure flies when you're

935
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,119
making folks happy.

936
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,119
Well, the day has ended. Let's return to the Chibi house.

937
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:24,449
Okay.

938
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:26,449
Great work out there.

939
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,449
Let's adjust your happy point total.

940
01:06:28,449 --> 01:06:31,780
Your Chibi

941
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,780
ranking has gone from

942
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,780
7 to 82. That was a huge

943
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:38,659
increase. Good job, Chibi

944
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:40,659
Robo. You passed almost half

945
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:42,659
a million inactive accounts.

946
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:48,800
Great. In order to get the next bonus

947
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,800
battery, you need 13 more happy points.

948
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:56,179
If you ever reach the top of the rankings, you get to

949
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,179
become super Chibi Robo.

950
01:06:58,179 --> 01:07:03,869
Super Chibi Frog.

951
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:05,869
Well, maybe I'm speaking too soon, but you'll be upgraded to the

952
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:07,869
super luxurious super Chibi

953
01:07:07,869 --> 01:07:10,690
Frog Robo, or that's what I've heard.

954
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,690
Girlbots won't be able to leave you alone.

955
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,059
While you're here, Chibi Robo,

956
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,000
you like to save.

957
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,389
Maybe one time it'll work.

958
01:07:21,389 --> 01:07:23,389
You know what I mean? What if it just works one of these times?

959
01:07:23,389 --> 01:07:32,860
It might just work. I have an idea.

960
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:36,510
Format it. Erase all, save, and

961
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,510
format the data. Okay?

962
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:40,510
Memory card's been formatted. Now what if I pull it out?

963
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:45,119
Maybe if I pull it out?

964
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:52,159
Right?

965
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:54,909
Let me try this. Cause it's, oh, it's been formatted.

966
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:58,690
Now I'm gonna pull the card out.

967
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,699
Okay. Alright.

968
01:08:01,699 --> 01:08:24,100
Now I wonder, does that

969
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,100
sound the Wii? No, it's the game.

970
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,460
Try slot B. I can't

971
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,460
put anything in slot B. The game doesn't recognize

972
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,460
slot B. You can't save to slot B

973
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:38,739
for some reason.

974
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:40,739
And this guide says all you have to do...

975
01:08:40,739 --> 01:08:42,739
Wait, what? This guide says all you have to do is

976
01:08:42,739 --> 01:08:44,739
download two things.

977
01:08:44,739 --> 01:08:48,770
Why can't I scroll up anymore?

978
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:55,420
Download two things, Monka-esque.

979
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,729
No, it'll be alright.

980
01:08:57,729 --> 01:08:59,729
I'll, I'll, I'll

981
01:08:59,729 --> 01:09:01,729
figure it out. I'm just gonna have to just

982
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:03,729
leave it on until tomorrow and then put the

983
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:05,729
new card in.

984
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:10,260
Or, so after

985
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,260
when the stream is over, I might

986
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,260
go figure out how to get

987
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,260
that saved tonight before I

988
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,260
go to bed. You know what I'm saying? Like I'm gonna make sure

989
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,260
this is saved before I go to sleep.

990
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:29,220
Just please, for the love of God,

991
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,220
do not turn off, like,

992
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:35,819
the power. I, okay,

993
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:37,819
I hope the bill's been paid. It has.

994
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:39,819
But one of the, I'm freaking

995
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:41,819
up. Can I play a video game?

996
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,819
Welcome to the Chibi PC.

997
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:46,579
Recycletron.

998
01:09:46,579 --> 01:09:49,329
Living room ladder?

999
01:09:49,329 --> 01:09:51,329
Collect scrap to build utility bots.

1000
01:09:51,329 --> 01:10:04,960
Okay, how much scrap do I have?

1001
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,199
A ladder that reaches

1002
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,199
high places placed near the Chibi

1003
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,630
Robo house. Build it.

1004
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,630
I don't have any, oh, I don't have any scraps.

1005
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,630
Online shop.

1006
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,630
Timer 10, timer 15.

1007
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,630
Pink flower seeds,

1008
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:21,630
Chibi blaster. Oh, this is

1009
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,630
cool. Alright, I don't have any money.

1010
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:31,819
I don't have any points.

1011
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:35,470
There are game over screens.

1012
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:37,970
This is a ticking time bump.

1013
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:39,970
There are game over screens that require a load.

1014
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:42,720
You're gonna be very sad.

1015
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,720
Uh...

1016
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:52,079
No, don't say this.

1017
01:10:52,079 --> 01:11:07,619
Hold on.

1018
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:09,619
Empty SD card, SD card reader for PC.

1019
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:14,989
Download

1020
01:11:14,989 --> 01:11:16,989
Banner Bomb 2

1021
01:11:16,989 --> 01:11:18,989
from the download link.

1022
01:11:18,989 --> 01:11:23,729
Alright, I

1023
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:26,539
can't do this right now.

1024
01:11:26,539 --> 01:11:37,300
That's not a virus.

1025
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,300
I know, I know. Alright, I gotta

1026
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,500
figure out what the fuck I wanna do here.

1027
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:53,810
Um, shit. Okay.

1028
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:57,380
I have an idea. I have an idea.

1029
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,939
Let me just check something

1030
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:09,470
real quick. Just play another game.

1031
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:11,710
Yeah, we might have to come back

1032
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:13,710
to this. I don't, I don't wanna

1033
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,710
fuck this up. I don't wanna fuck this up.

1034
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:18,340
We might

1035
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:22,300
have to come back to this. I really

1036
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,300
wanna play this. We might have to do this like tomorrow.

1037
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,300
Ah, I really wanna play this.

1038
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:35,500
Hold on, just a second.

1039
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,500
I am very, very

1040
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,500
confused because I remember

1041
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,500
specifically playing

1042
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,899
played Viewtiful Joe

1043
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:47,649
on this system and used

1044
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:49,649
this memory card for like

1045
01:12:49,649 --> 01:12:51,649
10 seconds to test the, to see

1046
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:53,649
if it makes sure things worked. And it worked.

1047
01:12:53,649 --> 01:13:04,270
It'll still be here, don't spoil

1048
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:08,750
the experience. Yeah, just

1049
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,750
emulate it. Alright, that's not

1050
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,750
just go download an ISO

1051
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,750
of 5 parts of Chibi Robo and

1052
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,750
combine them illegally and then use it.

1053
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,750
That's gonna take like

1054
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,750
half an hour for me to do that.

1055
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:27,979
That's not something I can do right now.

1056
01:13:27,979 --> 01:13:34,380
Every place that has emulation

1057
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,380
they, it's the download, they

1058
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,380
like throttle you download and shit.

1059
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,380
Trust me, I know. You download

1060
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,380
from all these websites at like 600k

1061
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:52,289
a second. Alright.

1062
01:13:52,289 --> 01:13:54,289
Alright, I'm ripping the Band-Aid off. I have to.

1063
01:13:54,289 --> 01:13:56,289
The Band-Aid's coming off. I'm gonna

1064
01:13:56,289 --> 01:13:58,289
put in Viewtiful Joe. And I'm gonna

1065
01:13:58,289 --> 01:14:00,289
see if this, what the fuck is going on here.

1066
01:14:00,289 --> 01:14:02,289
I'm ripping the Band-Aid off. I'll play this another day.

1067
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:04,289
I can't, I already love the game.

1068
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:06,289
I don't want to fucking tarnish it. I want to play it for real.

1069
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:21,970
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I really, I'm sorry

1070
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:23,970
guys. I, we're gonna change

1071
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,970
to something else. Give me one second. Let me just

1072
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,970
I'm gonna put in Viewtiful Joe.

1073
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:29,970
Viewtiful Joe is fucking equally as incredible.

1074
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,970
