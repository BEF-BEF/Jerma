1
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:12,310
Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with the new scout weapon the backscatter or the spy scout backstab gun

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,149
Also going to be using in this video the cloak device for the scout and the jumpy jump melee

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,710
So if you put all these together you kind of just turn into a spy and here you go

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,620
If there is ever a place where this

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,420
Should shine it's probably right here

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,399
Once they push the card up a little bit to like right about here

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,780
Is when I could be able to come in and get at least a couple of backstabs just like a spy

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,500
Well, you know what? We'll get this guy too because we can you know, why not but i'm gonna burn here

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,619
Where do I know so i'm not worth it. I'm committed to this

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,710
I'm not going anywhere and I don't want to drink the bonk. I will take the burn damage

11
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,990
Because it's important that they get on this card right now like right now. Okay, here we go. Here we go

12
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,310
This no, you know, you don't don't kill him leave him alone

13
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,310
This is this is where we slowly just go like this and just kill this guy

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:13,400
Okay, good good good good backstab good job i'll get out no don't get out bring this guy no

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,459
You ruined my plan. My plan was to

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:25,189
All right, everybody we're getting up on this guy. Nice job. Okay, we're back to square one. I'm not spotted yet

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,780
This pyro is looking for spies. So he's looking for me

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,780
Not turning your back now, are you?

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,709
Oh

20
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,469
I probably would have got that kill anyways if I had just shot him with the regular scatter gun

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,519
Hey

22
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:48,390
You're under arrest for backstabbing my friend. Okay, I need the health and

23
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:57,060
Back to square one use the jumpy jump. Make sure nobody sees you good good

24
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,390
Now we

25
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,340
We wait

26
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,140
Oh, i've been spotted. Oh, i've been spotted but he can't get up here unless he goes all the way around

27
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,490
He's gonna go all the way around and he's gonna die

28
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,740
Hey

29
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,110
Get out of here. This guy's trying to come up. I've gone gone. See he doesn't even know i'm there. I made it out alive

30
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:32,300
Here's my new spot. Here's my new spot waiting for this heavy. There he is. Got him. Got him. All right. Watch out soldier

31
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,500
Watch out. Watch out

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,389
Uh boy

33
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,759
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Where is he? I'm trying to up

34
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,810
Oh

35
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,430
That's the rule. That's the rule

36
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,909
And he died

37
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,189
No

38
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,629
No

39
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,310
No, don't ruin this

40
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,310
Me and the scout. No shit

41
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,389
No

42
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:03,699
Dude, he can't hit me over here. I got it my charge. Come on. Come on my drink

43
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,590
God damn it. The drink needs to charge right now charge it up. Come on

44
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,699
God damn it

45
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:22,409
You are not me and you are gonna get back stabbed and so is this guy?

46
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,240
Okay, that's two the one thing I will say when you use the bonk nobody ever like pays attention to you

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,120
Nobody ever like wants to know if you're still around

48
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,949
It's crazy, right? Like I feel like I am a spy scout

49
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,270
Because of the bonk

50
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,830
Check this out. See he knows I exist

51
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,409
He's gonna forget I ever existed. All I have to do is come back here. I'm using my dead ringer right now

52
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:58,650
I just use the dead ringer. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What is why a pyro is just appearing in front of me

53
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,199
Seriously, like what the hell was that?

54
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,659
Two pyros just oh jeez louise

55
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,610
Oh, jeez

56
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,610
Come on. Let me get this guy. Come on

57
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,459
Well, I made it behind everybody can I

58
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:26,040
Be sneaky enough where I can get somebody from behind, you know the best place

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,910
You know what screw your teleporter you guys are gonna have to walk now

60
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,670
You're gonna have to walk and once you start walking and that's when you're gonna get back stabbed by the spy scouts. Bye

61
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:46,420
Oh, fuck push it push it

62
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,470
God, come on. Let me get that one hit on them. Let me

63
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:57,189
All right

64
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:05,029
Hey for those of you that remember who remembers those old soldier paratrooper toys the things with like the crappy parachutes on their backs

65
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,389
If you threw them in the air half the time they would do what he just did

66
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:14,120
The soldier just turned into one of those right there. That was insane. All right. Well anyways

67
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,660
Am I gonna be able to do anything up here or is this guy coming for me? You're gonna come for me?

68
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
Oh, yeah, nice try

69
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
I'll backstab your pyro friend

70
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,980
And then guess what i'm gonna backstab your soldier friend, too

71
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,550
But I won't get the kill

72
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,589
But I won't get the killer. Oh will I no i'm getting this kill i'll fly behind you

73
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:37,850
Anybody else up here? What the hell did you just kill? What did that guy just shoot?

74
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,920
Dude, the new the new demo night terrifies the absolute shit out of me. It really does

75
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,879
Can we be frank for a second? This new demo night is is fucking terrifying

76
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,959
Everything about this demo night is is awfully hard. I'm just like talking now and not even paying attention to the fucking game

77
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,180
Hey pal, you're dead

78
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,339
Oh, there's multiple multiple ones of you

79
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,959
There are more than one of you

80
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,420
They're everywhere. They're fucking everywhere

81
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,850
dude

82
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,529
All right. Can we just can we just go over how far I just flew right there?

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,319
I'm okay with that one

84
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,120
You want to talk about a stair stab? That was like a mountain stab. That was a mountain jump stab

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,500
Watch out for the demo nights got our demo nights versus their demo nights

86
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,790
It's just a demo night party. That's what it is. We're gonna go this way

87
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,250
Don't need to drink yet

88
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,939
Now I do

89
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:53,980
Now I do

90
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,740
I'll see you later

91
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,379
I don't want anything to do with you

92
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,939
I just want to get behind your entire team. Is that so much to ask?

93
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:05,980
I can see the shadows. I can see where you are. Holy shit. Are you kidding me?

94
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:13,509
Where's this guy waiting for me? What's this guy doing? Well in that case

95
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,410
Okay

96
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,410
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude

97
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,819
Well, how long is this gonna last that's the question

98
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:30,310
Okay. Bye bye medic friend. You're blocking me you block

99
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:40,139
Two three four five. We got a lot of people here. Let's just go back around. I know you see me

I know you see me now. You see me now. You don't I told you I told you

101
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,180
Invisible and confirmed invisible

102
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
If that doesn't prove it, I don't know what does
