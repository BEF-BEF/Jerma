1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:09,960
Welcome to 2020. I know it's been, it's been four days, but you know, it's 2020 nonetheless.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,900
How are you? God, shut up already. What? I just turned it on. What are you talking about?

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:28,469
Hey, hey. Oh God. First comment I read in 2020 is that great. It was a good start. Anyways,

4
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,799
starting a little late today. The plan originally was we were going to do

5
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:41,700
keep talking and everybody will be whatever. Keep talking and nobody explodes with Joel,

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,659
but Joel's not feeling well. He kind of last second was like, I'm sorry to do that. I feel

7
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:50,259
like shit right now. And I'm like, don't, it's all good. Don't fucking worry about it. It's all good.

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,810
We're just going to do it tomorrow. So today, today we're going to do something else.

9
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,689
And what we're going to do is I've got a lot of games to play. I've got a huge list over the

10
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:10,890
last couple of days, at least I've been compiling at least what I want to start to do in 2020.

11
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:16,040
Derma falls on the street. Yeah. And I also, I've looked at the images.

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,560
I've seen the images of the, everyone that like weird mutant face that I have when I'm in the

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:34,060
chair. I know it looks doctored, but it isn't, but it, it looks bad. I know, I know I've seen it.

14
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,980
Anyways, we don't have the idea because we're starting really late. So I want to kind of get

15
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:46,340
right into this. So here comes the game. This is, this is flashing lights is the game. This

16
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:54,019
actually was requested more than once. This is a requested video game. This is a game we play as

17
00:01:54,019 --> 00:02:02,310
police, ambulance and fire. No, not like not actual flashing lights. You know, you're not

18
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:13,219
going to get like flashed. This was requested twice. I don't, I have no, I saw the screenshots. I saw

19
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:18,979
like a few seconds of the trailer and I'm like, okay, fine. All right. I'll give it a try.

20
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:30,069
I'll give it a try. If this game is not, if we, I got two other like last minute additions,

21
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:37,349
that should be fun. Uh, we did a poll earlier and this is what was voted for. Again, 2020 is going

22
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,710
to be no different. I'm going to make this really, really clear. The power of the pre-stream chat.

23
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:50,180
This got like 70% of the vote. And if you want to know what it beat out, it beat out Katana Zero

24
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,419
and Wizorb. Just say it. The power of the pre-stream chat. Don't think you don't have power.

25
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:09,000
Somebody just wrote seriously? Seriously? Anyway, let's go. I don't know. Let's play.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,900
This is called flashing lights. Uh, max vehicle traffic. Why don't we make this, um,

27
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:30,439
why do I have to do this? Max pedestrians. Yeah, you know, I want 99 vehicles. Sorry,

28
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:40,550
it's 20. Uh, okay. How about 12? Parked vehicle density, medium high, medium time,

29
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:49,340
day fuel consumption, medium, I guess. Is this like a simulator? Do I, is it like a tutorial?

30
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,919
There's 12 people in the whole city. All right. Is it, do I, this is really low volume too. Hold on.

31
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,919
This is going to be really high volume in about five seconds. Guarantee it. Let's find out.

32
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:11,189
I'm not looking forward to this. I'm scared. This is really, really, it's going to be really

33
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:28,730
fucking loud. Is this the same image? Wait, what? Is that a tank? Why is there a tank? Oh, hold on.

34
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:35,449
Can you hear this? And now you can. All right. Police firefighter or medic. Which one do you

35
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:45,209
want to start with? Uh, I feel like the title of the stream is doctor officer fireman. So we're

36
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:52,459
going to start as doctor. Let's do medic. And this, I can't hear anything. Medic. Done. Uh, male.

37
00:04:53,339 --> 00:05:00,870
Okay. Uh, three bodies. Okay. You can either, you can wear a Christmas hat,

38
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:14,149
um, and sunglasses. At what point do you just not have a character creator? I'm just going to be

39
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:23,079
completely honest. Like just, do you really need sunglasses? There's three options. Like,

40
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:29,290
do you really need sunglasses? This is the EMT from the rumble. Holy shit. It actually is.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,300
Oh my God. That's fucked up. That's really what it is. Uh, we had huge bits come in from

42
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,579
bilateral lich. Thank you for electric for the 5,000 bits. They say Jeremy is the police monkey.

43
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:53,220
S well, not yet. I'm the medic. All right. We're going to go with this. This is fine.

44
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:02,569
So I have to go help people, but seriously, thank you for the fucking $50 by luxury

45
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:10,839
starting 2020 off with huge money already. Thank you. I got to turn this up. This is really low.

46
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:27,879
Okay. Emergency medical service. It's like, it's like an open world. All right. Let me turn this

47
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:45,899
up. 75, 70, 77, 78, 79. Unconscious person at address green tag. What? Hold on. Address unconscious

48
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:52,500
person at address green tag. Call ID respond. Okay. Except unconscious person at green tag.

49
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:59,379
How do I get in a car? David too is responding to unconscious person. All right. I get in.

50
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:10,250
I don't even get a tutorial. Engine on. Okay. Lights sign. How do I drive right now? This is

51
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:19,449
fucking loud. Now we, of course it is. It's one of those loud and soft games. All right. 65 sounds

52
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:26,680
all right to me. All right. Here we go. Unconscious person over at green. Do I turn my siren on?

53
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:41,079
What? I got minus points because I bumped a stop sign. Really? Okay. How long do I have?

54
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,740
Do you have to follow the rule? I feel like I'm explaining Grand Theft Auto. All right. Hold on.

55
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:57,699
Unconscious person. See, I'm not making any, there's no damage. I just, I skimmed that person.

56
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,180
Inspect the person. Check if they can be transported to the hospital.

57
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:20,550
Interact using med bag. Where's my med bag? Why can you punch as a medic? Why? Why can you punch

58
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,990
as a medic? Okay. Med bag. Interact using med bag or other items from your vehicle trunk.

59
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:42,120
Okay. Let's get it out. Items. Okay. Stretcher. I got to put this guy on the stretcher.

60
00:08:45,659 --> 00:09:02,539
Uh, what the fuck is going on? All right. How do I put them on? I put you on the stretcher.

61
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:06,299
Don't run them over. I'm not going to run them over. Oh, wait, here we go. Okay.

62
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:24,570
Wait, why is there an indicator over his head? Um, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Hold on.

63
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:31,370
Can I go back in here? You got a nerd neck. All right. What do we got? Technical defibrillator.

64
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:46,710
This is my first day. I'm sorry. Okay. Shock pads. Remove top part of clothing. What? What do you

65
00:09:46,710 --> 00:10:04,070
mean? What do you mean remove top part of cloth? How do I, how, what? All right. Well, this doesn't

66
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:20,039
work. Um, items. Fracture kit. Medic bag. All right. Medic bag. I got it. Inspect patient. Here we go.

67
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:27,059
All right. What's wrong? You hit your head? Breathing. He has pulse. Unconscious. Uh, what

68
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:33,210
about his stomach? Inspect it. He has a pulse. You can feel a pulse from somebody's stomach?

69
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:47,049
It has pulse. Okay. You have a pulse. You have a pulse. You have a pulse. All right. I've,

70
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:54,440
you, I do have to use the defibrillator. All right. Where's that? Where's the, oh shit. Um,

71
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:10,039
okay. No, no, no, no, no. That, I think that's correct. Where's the defib? All right. I got it.

72
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:20,659
Okay. Um, what? Okay. Uh, grab the stretcher from the ambulance and load the patient

73
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:26,740
to deliver to the hospital. Wait, his friend's leaving. I'm not done. You, you might, can you,

74
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:41,259
uh, okay. His friend's leaving. How do I, he has a pulse. He's good. Did I really knock a car over?

75
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:50,379
All right. But how do I put him on the stretcher? I need a second EMT for this. How do you put him

76
00:11:50,379 --> 00:12:03,639
on the stretcher? Using med bag. Can I lower the stretcher? Is there any other buttons I can press?

77
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,649
Inspect you. Wait, let me give him the med bag. Give me the med bag. Okay. Let's try that. So

78
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:21,110
perform CPR. Neck collar. Uh, okay. I got a call. I got him in a neck collar. His neck was injured.

79
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:37,220
Okay. Um, now transport. Request transport. Wait, I am the ambulance. Unconscious person. Dispatch

80
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,230
received. Aren't I the ambulance? So why did an ambulance just call an ambulance?

81
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,340
I can't get him on the stretcher. Why would I call the ambulance?

82
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:59,340
Well, are they coming? Oh, there they are. Oh, don't worry. We'll take it from here.

83
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:18,250
Wait, there's a vehicle incident. Vehicle incident. Respond. Code three. Wait, I'm not yet. I want to

84
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,500
see what happens here. Well, you just kind of scooped him up. All right, let's go. Vehicle

85
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:31,480
incident. I got to load this stuff back onto the car. How do you put people on? That does a weird

86
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,539
indicator there and I'm not sure what it is. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you for putting it in.

87
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:44,460
You helped me put it back in the trunk. Good job. Oh, gunshot. Oh, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I got

88
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:55,559
to put my, I got to put my stereos back in. Just get out of the way. Get out of the way. Out of the

89
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:09,179
way. Okay. Can I not pick this up? Pick it up. I, there's nobody, there's nobody on the ground.

90
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:18,740
Why is it, why am I getting this? Remove all. Okay. All right, let's go. All right, vehicle incident.

91
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:35,769
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Why can't I drive? Am I driving the car in front of me? Oh, shit,

92
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:53,080
I'm in the wrong seat. Hold on. Okay, let's go. Where was it? Oh, it's all the way up here.

93
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:07,879
That's so far away. Filactory. Again, another $50. Holy shit, dude. 5,000 bits from file. I need you,

94
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,480
I need you to find out how many ambulances you can call at once. I was thinking about doing that,

95
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:19,429
but I think no, not quite. We're not quite there yet. We're not there yet. But yeah, I feel you.

96
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:31,500
Yeah, I want to call every single emergency service. Vehicle incident. Is there a handbrake?

97
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:43,129
Shit. Is this pre-recorded? Uh, no, it is not. Those of you that just trickled in,

98
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:47,450
Joel and I were going to play keep talking to nobody explodes today, but Joel was not feeling

99
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,429
well. Uh, he kind of just, uh, right at the, right before we were about to start, he was just like,

100
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:59,669
I fucking feel like shit right now. He just, it just jumped on him. So we're going to do it tomorrow.

101
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:18,120
Joel's health is more important. Defusing fake bombs. Seriously, this is, why do I have to go

102
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,539
all the way around here? This is no better way for me to go. This is just trying to hit me.

103
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:47,690
This is the worst emergency route ever. Why is it not an emergency route? Multi-lane driving. No,

104
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,409
shouldn't, shouldn't it be like an off road that's, wait, this is the wrong way.

105
00:16:51,289 --> 00:17:01,659
All right. What's the other siren? Is there no other siren? Wait, I can turn my blinkers on?

106
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:19,799
Why, for what? Whoa. Okay. I'm fine. That was actually scary because I have to call an ambulance.

107
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,900
I have to call an ambulance.

108
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:42,660
All right. I gotta call an ambulance. Hey, where's my medic bag? Okay. Need an ambulance.

109
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,000
How do I call an ambulance? I can run there. I can run there. I can run there.

110
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:58,920
It's right there. I got my medic bag. I can, I can call the, I can call for another ambulance.

111
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:14,069
What the fuck was that? Okay. Imagine, imagine you got in a car accident and you look down,

112
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:20,069
you got like a broken leg and you look down the, all the way down here and you see the medic

113
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:27,500
and EMT running up the hill with a bag. How disappointed would you be?

114
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,579
And you look even further down, you see that he drove into a ditch. All right. I'm here. I'm here.

115
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:46,019
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. How's the patient? Inspect the person. Okay. There's the tank.

116
00:18:47,559 --> 00:19:15,940
All right. What happened here? Leg, broken leg? No. Wait, what did it say? Not breathing, no pulse.

117
00:19:18,759 --> 00:20:04,920
Okay. Um, perform CPR. Uh, what? How do you do CPR? How do you CPR? Does this get dead? Okay. Um,

118
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:14,390
I need the defib. I need the defib. All right. I'll be right back. Wait, wait. Can I have your car?

119
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:29,460
Can I borrow your car? Can I take this car? Okay. Let me request an ambulance. Let me request an

120
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:48,339
ambulance. Okay. Request transport. Patients not ready for transport. God damn it. You can't get

121
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:58,039
hurt. Can you, can you reset the car? I don't think so. Not that I'm aware of.

122
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,450
Can I get the car? I think I can get the car out of the ditch. I can, I think I can move it.

123
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,259
Yeah. I think somebody just mentioned it. Why is there a jump even programmed into the game?

124
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,400
Just for fun? I mean, I guess that's just kind of for fun. You can reset the car.

125
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:40,940
How? All right. If I get out and move like this. Okay. Here we go. I got it. Why didn't I do it?

126
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,380
I should have just done this in the first place. God damn it. Okay. Whatever. It's fine.

127
00:21:45,019 --> 00:22:06,490
Do I need gas? I think I need gas. I need the stretcher. Do you need the stretcher?

128
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:14,539
No, I don't. I need the defib. How did that even fall out? The doors are closed. What the

129
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:21,559
fuck are they talking about? All right. I'm here. No, thanks to you two officers. Thanks a lot.

130
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:33,369
All right. Give me my, look, stretcher. Items. Stretcher. Items. Um, was it defib?

131
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:44,740
Technical. Defib. Let's go. Okay. Let's put it on. Here we go. I'm here. What does that mean?

132
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,150
What does that mean? What does that mean? What does that mean? What does that mean?

133
00:22:49,460 --> 00:23:04,279
What does that mean? Does anybody know what that means? How many times do you have to do this?

134
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:19,740
Okay. Is he alive? He's alive. Right? All right. Let's go. Give me my med bag.

135
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:51,029
Uh, hold on. Is he alive? No pulse. I killed him. The patient's not ready for transportation.

136
00:23:53,109 --> 00:24:14,630
Didn't, didn't he just have a pulse? Look, see? Patient's not ready for transportation.

137
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:37,690
Do I have to have the stretcher? Where is the stretcher? Back here? It's not that far.

138
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:53,180
You have to put his clothes back on. Why is it so hard for me to drive over this road?

139
00:24:56,329 --> 00:25:07,859
Where's the stretcher? Isn't it right here? It was right here. Another $50 from Phylactery?

140
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:16,970
Holy shit, Phylactery. Really? Oh my God. Get boots. All right. Put that in. Let's go.

141
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:41,380
All right. Get over here. I'm just learning. I'm learning how to play. Please don't do this again.

142
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:52,710
Move. Bro, you need to learn how to read. No, I don't. Speaking of reading, five community subs.

143
00:25:52,710 --> 00:26:00,039
I can read that from Flinzenberg. Thank you Flinzenberg for the five subs and Vilemi for

144
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,400
there's more money coming in. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. There's a shitload of money coming in.

145
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:15,339
You guys didn't stop from New Year's Eve. Oh my goodness. He can only read Greed. It's not true.

146
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:21,500
Vilemi, 5,000 fucking bits from Vilemi. If I'm ever dying, I hope to God you're not the EMT

147
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:27,099
that responds to my 911 call. Well, I wouldn't because I'm not an EMT. I'm an internet clown.

148
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:31,720
And now that would be odd if an internet clown had to come and take care of you.

149
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:55,930
How do I fill up gas? Another five community subs from Adventure MF Dan. Where's the,

150
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:01,450
in an emergency vehicle, where's the gas? Wrong side? Shit, it's the wrong side. Whatever,

151
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:07,349
whatever. I don't need it right now. There's a guy lying on the ground dying. I'm going.

152
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:19,289
Had his hest. 2,045 cents for gas. That's pretty cheap. He's not dead. He's going to be fine.

153
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:26,809
Flutter is 10 community subs. Holy shit, guys. Thank you. More subs. All right, I'm here.

154
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,660
Look, there was no real tutorial. I'm trying to figure it out as we go.

155
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:42,119
Drive on the roads. I did too much Grand Theft Auto in my blood. Okay, I have the stretcher now.

156
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:50,490
Stretcher. Let's get it. All right, I just like causing injury to somebody else.

157
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:56,970
Phylactery, what on earth are you doing, man? Phylactery, 60 fucking nine subs. What are you

158
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:07,500
doing? Holy fuck, dude. Hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Hundreds. All right, I get a, that's a

159
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:14,460
lot of subs. 69 fucking community subs. All right, how do I put you on the stretcher? I have an

160
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:22,299
indicator, but I can't do anything about it. Jeremy, you need to buy phylactery dinner at

161
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:28,619
this point. Phylactery's bought me dinner like 6,000 times. So, I mean, all right, hold on.

162
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:43,700
This is an indicator right here. Request transport. Not ready for transport. No pulse.

163
00:28:43,700 --> 00:29:06,619
CPR again? Do the defib again. Okay. All right, stop doing that. Get up. What is additional?

164
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:34,619
Traffic cones? What? Why do I have this? I'm just like playing. What a dick. Okay, all right,

165
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:47,700
all right, all right. Defib, let's go. Defib, okay. Put them back on. You've got a pulse. Why

166
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,180
does it say no pulse? Grab the stretcher. I already did this. Load the patient and deliver

167
00:29:52,180 --> 00:30:07,539
to the hospital. Okay, okay, okay. How do I load the patient? Oh, cannot do this while the, oh,

168
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:15,220
I have to undo the connections. All right, undo these connections. All right, put this down.

169
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:33,900
So, you do have to kind of go over them. Okay, pick up. Got him. All right, let's go. Into the car.

170
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:56,230
Let's go. Into the car. Okay, let's go. Let's go. He's going. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Not into the

171
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:12,039
river. Not into the river. Okay, get in. All right, door's closed. Let's get you to the hospital.

172
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:23,829
Where's the hospital? Yeah, I know, I know. I, yes, I'm aware that we just did like a 90s comedy

173
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:33,539
routine. Yes. That, I think that happens in every single Leslie Nielsen movie. And, I mean, those

174
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:45,690
movies are legendary, but that does happen. All right, let's go back. Get your bag. I don't need

175
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:55,720
my bag. I'll get a new, I'll get a new bag. Can I skip this? Hold on. All right, that guy just hit

176
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:03,099
the ceiling of the ambulance. He went like, boom, boom. I'm not going down that stupid thing again.

177
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,369
I'm so glad there's no time limit because this would be so stupid. I'm not driving down that

178
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:44,309
bullshit again. There's no cars on the road. Why would I even need to have the siren? Hopefully,

179
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:55,299
this guy's bolted to the ground. All right. Where do I go? Just drop off at the front.

180
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:34,900
Okay. Get them out. Let's go in. All right. Where? Into the here. I did it. Patient delivered. All

181
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:49,609
right. That was pretty fun. Okay. See, and I got a new medical bag too. You guys were so concerned

182
00:33:49,609 --> 00:34:05,990
about that. Did I miss any of the calls? All right. I have two patients hospital. Here we go. Another

183
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:12,260
vehicle incident. Uh, skip this one. All right. I'm going to fill it. I'm going to get gas.

184
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:30,579
You're wasting tax dollars. I mean, am I though? It's like seven ambulances. This is not how you

185
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:39,510
pull into a gas station. What the fuck am I doing? Where's the, um, it's right there. Okay.

186
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:50,139
Skip. I don't drive big cars guys. I'm so used to being on the, it's on my car. It's on the

187
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:56,940
right side. Okay. So that's why I, and it's like that every time. And yes, I know you have to look

188
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,659
every time that you have to look at your gas meter on your dashboard every time. Yeah. You do

189
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:15,670
too. Even if you've owned the car for 10 years. Okay. I got to turn the engine off. What vehicle

190
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:38,679
incident? Nah. All right. Fuel. How do I feel? Is it fueling? Is it fueling? I have to pay that

191
00:35:38,679 --> 00:36:00,699
due to pay money. Vehicle incident. Nah. What was this? I've got a currency. Hey, I don't know. I'm

192
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:11,059
not sure. I do have, okay. You just, you just click it and it fills instantly. All right. I just need

193
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:16,500
to see. I'm just curious. Can I make my own incident to then bring this person to the hospital?

194
00:36:18,119 --> 00:37:00,889
Don't worry. I got you. I'll take care of you. What's, what happened? What? Uh, where are you

195
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:08,119
going? You're going the wrong way. Where are you going? Hold on. You're going the wrong way. This

196
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:23,289
way. Did you fuck? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait. They can't get over here. All right. Hold on. Wait.

197
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:26,650
I have to cause a couple more injuries. This is where we test it out. This is where we test the

198
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:57,380
theory. Can steal the other ambulance. Hold on. I will. Or I'll try. All right. Ambulance on route.

199
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:30,570
Ambulance on route. Okay. Move. Move. Get out of the way. How many ambulances can I have at the same

200
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:59,380
time? Oh God. Here we go. Come here. I got you. Damn it. That's the plan. Okay. We got a new plan

201
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:08,199
here. Yeah. When the EMT gets out, run over the EMT and then call an ambulance for the EMT.

202
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:19,929
Fuck. They're immune. Damn it. They're immune to damage. No, they're immune to damage. It's not

203
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:35,480
fair. Not fair. That guy's pissed. You keep yourself in business, but they can't go anywhere.

204
00:39:36,199 --> 00:40:01,860
All right. Vehicle incident. Where's the vehicle incident? It's all the way back there.

205
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:14,570
Turn your blinker off. Oh shit. You're right. I'm sorry. Another vehicle incident hit a ton. Yeah.

206
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,929
All right. All right. All right. We gotta, we gotta get to, we gotta get to a spawn area

207
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:22,090
because what I'm going to do is I'm going to run over like 10 people and then I'm going to get out

208
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:26,010
and I'm going to go bang, bang, bang, boom, boom, boom, boom, bum, bum, bum, calling me as ambulance,

209
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:37,539
ambulance, ambulance, ambulance, and roll. Why is my blinker still on? Turn it off. It's a guy's,

210
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:53,849
my blinker's off. Deep. I can't turn it off. It's odd. Now the other one's on. They're going to go

211
00:40:53,849 --> 00:41:09,639
all the way up here again. Turn off blinker. Oh my God. It's driving me crazy now that you mentioned

212
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:14,789
it. I can't fucking believe I have to go up here again. I'm just gonna skip this one. Skip it. I

213
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:33,880
don't even want to do this one. Is it too late? You blinker fluid is too low. How do I D? How do

214
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:43,050
I like turn? I'm gonna get out of the car. Turn the engine off. Turn the engine on. Ready? Okay.

215
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:09,000
I can't turn it off. Just unplug the battery. Yeah. I know. Don't worry. That's the plan. The

216
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,300
plan is we're going to, we're going to hit at least 10 people and I'm going to run around and

217
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,980
call an ambulance for every single one of them and watch the chaos. Press three. Yeah. I mean that

218
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:35,429
look, look at the bottom of the, look at the bottom of the screen. Press the left arrow key.

219
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:59,670
That's turn. Okay. Save a little bit of time there. That noise is going to drive me fucking crazy.

220
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:04,309
It's going to drive me crazy. It really is. You're right. It's driving me crazy right now.

221
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:14,860
All right. I'm here. What happened? What an entrance. Oh, look, someone's lying on the ground.

222
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:38,980
Okay. I need the damn med bag. Just get it all out of here. All right. What's wrong? Inspect.

223
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:48,539
Head. No pulse. Okay. There's no pulse. Let's get the, uh, defib. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

224
00:43:49,179 --> 00:44:11,210
What are you doing? Oh, right click. Uh, hook it up. Okay. Uh, I have to, wait, what? Oh, um, hold

225
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:24,340
on. Wait, hold on. Okay. No, this is bathing suit. Okay. This is a bathing suit. All right. Um,

226
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,519
let's, uh, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the defib, where's the defib,

227
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:42,739
where's the defib, defib, defib, defib. I just did. Let me inspect. I didn't, I just do that.

228
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:55,659
I gotta go. Hurry up. Where's my med bag? I just teleported it. All right. Inspect. I have to

229
00:44:55,659 --> 00:45:03,059
inspect every single point here. I know the possible bone fracture. Oh shit. Okay. Perform

230
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:24,539
CPR. Okay. Here we go. How do I fix the bone fracture? What do I do? Okay. Use defib. All

231
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:42,440
right. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right. One, two, three. Um, that,

232
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:59,980
that just looks like a wavelength in audacity. Uh, shock pads. Okay. Here we go. Did it work?

233
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:14,539
Do I need a fracture kit? What's a fracture kit? All right. Fracture kit. Uh, technical items,

234
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:23,860
fracture kit. Okay. Here we go. That's it. All right. Grab the stretcher for the, and uh,

235
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:36,119
deliver it. Okay. Let's go. Wait. I have to take all this stuff off. All right. Give, I needed to

236
00:46:36,119 --> 00:47:00,019
get this off. Give me this. Okay. Remove. I fixed it. I'm good. Oh, I need to put cones in the road.

237
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:07,849
Oh, I got a fracture. I got a left leg fracture too. We're the same now. You and me. All right.

238
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:31,639
Here we go. Okay. No, I can't. I can't. I can't just into the water. Oh, no. Please. No.

239
00:47:47,019 --> 00:48:10,949
Don't worry. I'll get you. I think she's okay. Wait, can I, I can't just go into the ocean,

240
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:17,510
right? Why can't I go? Wait. Oh, shit. Wait, wait. Contact with water? What do you mean

241
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:40,860
contact with water? Is that a tube? I think I got fired. I think the game doesn't know what to do

242
00:48:40,860 --> 00:49:05,349
with me. Is a new, is a new person. Wait, she's still there? Vehicle incident. Sure. She's still

243
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:17,530
there? All right. Do you think that she is still there? Yes or no? What do you think? And can I

244
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:35,909
get her? No, no, it's definitely gonna reset. Okay. Whatever. Uh, oh yeah. Hey, this is not

245
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:49,900
a, we have two more departments to go through. Wait, what? Open. What do you want me to do?

246
00:49:50,619 --> 00:50:06,170
Why do I always get stuck like this in every game? Open chat window to, to respond. What?

247
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:35,530
What do I do? Slash car 100. Is that bullshit? Type car 100 to create tonic traffic.

248
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:58,179
That didn't do anything. Slash car 100. I'm not doing it. Is it car space 100? No, it's not.

249
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:24,949
You have to get out and do it. All right. Well, good. Nice. Good one. Got me. Baited. It's not

250
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:45,349
gonna, it's not working. Oh, I think we have a fire situation here. Inspect who? What is that?

251
00:51:45,349 --> 00:52:02,090
All right. What happened? Inspect. Breathing has pulse conscious possible neck injury. I know what

252
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:29,320
to do. See? Give me. Give me. Into the water you go. No, this one's not going to the water.

253
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:46,070
All right. Excuse me. That's my fucking medical bag in the way. All right. Let's go.

254
00:52:52,340 --> 00:53:00,440
The ocean, the ocean. I'm not putting them in the ocean. I don't think you can actually

255
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:06,489
go in this way. All right. You're in. Close. I don't think you can fall out that way. So who cares?

256
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:11,030
I really don't think you can. Speaking of which, I'm not sure I can get back in the car.

257
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:32,409
He definitely cannot fall out that way. All right. I think we may have seen all there is to see with

258
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:41,260
the EMT. I think it's time to switch to a firefighter. Yep. It's time. It's firefighter time.

259
00:53:54,309 --> 00:54:15,500
Yeah. I'm going to try. I'm going to try my bullshit one time. I've done so much weird shit

260
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:24,940
and how do I only have a... That's not that big of a deal. Minus one. All right. Let's go.

261
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:46,869
Out. Into the hospital. Let's go. Aha. Good. All right. If there's... If we have one more

262
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:53,480
opportunity here, I'm going to skip a couple and I want to get like a person fell off a tree or

263
00:54:53,480 --> 00:55:09,670
something. A person fell down a hole. Is there any of those? You can choose the next mission

264
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:16,460
with a command. Oh, I left a stretcher. I don't get a new one on a new mission. I thought that

265
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:37,929
happened last time. What did I do? I just pressed N. I just skipped something. Cheat codes? All right.

266
00:55:37,929 --> 00:56:01,909
Hold on. What is this? Change role. Oh, I can change role. It's that easy. Officer next.

267
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:22,820
So how much... How different is everything? Reputation, fire calls, rescue calls.

268
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:32,389
Do I have to pick up this stuff? No. What is... Select vehicle. Fire department car, ladder truck,

269
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:42,360
fire department, pumper truck. I mean, I want this one. Why would I not use that one? Building.

270
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:55,159
Okay. There's a fire. Let's go. Where's my car? Let's go. I got to put out 10 fires. All right.

271
00:56:55,159 --> 00:57:08,570
Open this up. How do I open this? Uh, open the garage? Open. Oh, shit. I have to go down here.

272
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:32,760
Okay. Let's go. Uh, how do I get out of the garage? And by the way, what is this bullshit on the front?

273
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:41,800
What is this cartoon thing? They don't have that. That would be so bad for people in the...

274
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,320
coming the other direction, wouldn't it? Like, just... That would be ridiculous.

275
00:57:45,320 --> 00:58:06,010
On top I'd just stay, but like, that's crazy. All right. Let's go. Siren doesn't do anything.

276
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:17,670
The siren doesn't do anything. All right. Here we go. Uh, the diner. How do I put out the fire?

277
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:23,659
How do I put the fire out? Oh, fire extinguisher. Right. Oh, no. Hose. Hose?

278
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:52,380
Do I have like a mask on? Uh, what do I do? Attach hose to the fire truck. Okay. Now,

279
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:28,389
is this what you do? Oh, there it is. Go in the... I gotta go in. Uh, this...

280
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:54,230
Is this... Am I doing this right? Oh, there's people. There's people in here. Where's the...

281
00:59:54,230 --> 01:00:13,159
Where's the hose? Am I dead? What? What happened? Is this an ambulance coming?

282
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:20,420
How are they gonna get in here? Play as the EMT and save yourself.

283
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:32,869
Is he an EMT? Is he gonna come in the front door?

284
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:48,409
Oh, shit. Wait, what? You brought me back to life. I did it!

285
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:07,820
There comes another ambulance. I have to run out of here. The second... I have to run the fuck out

286
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:34,949
immediately. What about this person? Is this person right here okay? I have to run out. Is

287
01:01:34,949 --> 01:01:46,250
the second... The second that he gets in here. There he comes. All right. Get me up. And we both

288
01:01:46,250 --> 01:02:00,940
have to run out. Get... Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Okay. Good. Now, where... Is my hose still in there or not?

289
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:15,420
Okay. I need another hose. Oh, shit. I need... I don't have a hose. Uh...

290
01:02:28,869 --> 01:02:36,389
Don't worry. I'm here to save the day. Oh, that's so stupid. All right. Get off.

291
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:47,219
Sneaking. Oh, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. That's dumb. How fast can I sneak?

292
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:57,460
Go on the roof. Okay. I don't think I can get on the roof. Can I get on the roof? I can get on the

293
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:11,420
roof. Holy shit. No. I need the ladder to get up there. No. No, I don't. I think I can jump over

294
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:28,360
this. I'm almost there. Come on. Okay. I'm on the roof. I've made it to the roof. What does this do

295
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:38,820
for me? Not much. Okay. Well, there's a fire. It's not just smoke. There's a fire up here.

296
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:58,179
Can the EMT get on the roof is a question that we'll have to ask. I soft-locked it? All right. I'll...

297
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:17,820
Is there a better camera? All right. Come on. Get up here. No, he doesn't get it. He doesn't get it.

298
01:04:18,619 --> 01:04:24,329
Does he get it? He gets it. Hold on. I just went in the building.

299
01:04:24,809 --> 01:05:01,110
I don't see him coming up. Somebody help me. Wait. What? You actually... He got me?

300
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:29,190
Holy shit. What a hero. He did it. All right. I need to... Okay. Here we go. Now put this down. I need

301
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:45,239
a... I need like a fan. All right. Give me a fan. How do I use this? How do you put the fan down?

302
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:52,550
All right. Did I put it down? I need like a mask or something. Where's like a mask?

303
01:05:53,909 --> 01:06:03,500
Traffic cones. Is this thing? Okay. I got it. It's on. All right. The scuba? Okay. Now I need the...

304
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:13,030
All right. Give me a fan. Where the hell's the fan? There it is. All right. Fan is in use. Let's blow

305
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:38,280
the smoke out the... Out here. Here we go. Watch out. Move. All right. Where's the last one? Right

306
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,369
up here, right? Isn't it somewhere right here? It's on the outside. It's outside. Outside.

307
01:06:44,090 --> 01:07:05,420
Is this working? No. This is not working. I have to get on... I might have to get on the roof. I have

308
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:14,780
to use the ladder on the roof. I gotta use the ladder on the roof. Hold on just a minute.

309
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:24,539
All right. Did you guys ever... Did your parents on Easter ever do this shit where...

310
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:30,619
For my family, each kid got a string that went around the whole house. And at the end of the

311
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:40,070
string that went all over the place was your Easter basket. That's what this was. That's what

312
01:07:40,070 --> 01:08:25,960
this is. How long is this? Can I spell my name? Oh, not quite. I was trying to spell Jeremy.

313
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:31,239
I'm writing an incursive. All right. Fine. I won't write an incursive. I'll do it regular.

314
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,479
It's... I thought it was gonna be easier to write an incursive. All right. I won't write an incursive.

315
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:58,739
Whoa. Okay. Here's the J. Right? That's done. Now I need E. So I need to go...

316
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:06,170
It has to be connected. So we'll go to like here. It's a J. Like it's gotta be a big loop, right? E.

317
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:14,039
No. Fuck. How do you make an E? Just we do... I do all capitals. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.

318
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:42,500
Don't fuck this up. Get out of the way. Why is this so long? Why can I do this? I don't even

319
01:09:42,500 --> 01:10:22,250
want to do this, but like it's available. So I'm going to do it. Fuck. Almost done. Almost done.

320
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:42,789
Relax. Relax. I have to see what it looks like. Okay. M. M is... Okay. Hold on. I gotta fix that.

321
01:10:51,829 --> 01:11:00,710
That looks like shit, but it's okay. And then just Y and I'm done. And I'll go back and I'm

322
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:07,930
just going to underline it. Okay. Y needs to be straight line up and then split it right here.

323
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:19,270
Come back. Split it this way. Ah! Ah! Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

324
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:25,060
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's a little messy, but it's fine. We did it. All right. There

325
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:42,550
it is. I wish I could get a big view. There's Jeremy. Okay. Cool. This thing's still going.

326
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:52,579
How can water even go through this? Ladder. Press E. What? What do you mean press E? Press E?

327
01:11:53,300 --> 01:12:15,609
Why press E? I don't get it. Why press E? Press E for ladder. This is fucking ridiculous.

328
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:25,319
Imagine just driving out. This is fucking crazy. Like this is ridiculous. I don't know why you can

329
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:44,840
do this. All right. E for ladder. E. Press E. What? I can't move. Oh no. Oh, what happened?

330
01:12:44,840 --> 01:13:09,340
What happened? Why is it turning into rabbit food? Oh Jesus. Why can I do this? Use ladder.

331
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:17,430
No, I can't. I don't want to. I can't. I need to move it. How do I move the ladder up and down?

332
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:27,699
The game was suffering. Is it in a trunk or something? Like fire. Fan. No. Additional.

333
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:50,819
Okay. I'm just going to spell my name real quick. J. E. I'm fucking kidding. Relax. All right. How

334
01:13:50,819 --> 01:14:00,710
do I put this down? Okay. So rescue ladder. Here we go. Wait. No, no. This is like a regular ladder.

335
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:09,689
Hold on. How do I put it down? I have a huge ladder. Why would I need to put the...

336
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:42,970
All right. I made it. No, I didn't. Honestly, I don't know how to move this big ladder up and

337
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:54,869
down. Is it inside the car? Like is it in the truck? Like I have to be inside? See? No. Is it

338
01:14:54,869 --> 01:15:18,340
actually on top? No, it's not. Is it? I have to actually be on it. Oh, all right. What the fuck is

339
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:43,289
this? How far can this go? Q is... Okay. Q E is up. All right. Holy shit. This is high. A little to

340
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:52,939
the right. All right. A little to the left. All right. That's where I can go. Let's go

341
01:15:54,060 --> 01:16:03,180
down with it. Right here. Okay. Looks good. Press to, press to lock in the ladder. Okay.

342
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:14,680
Lock in the ladder. All right. Now I'm going to get off and I'm going to get the hose. Lock in. Okay.

343
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:37,659
Don't worry. I'm fine. All right. Let's go. I'm actually excited for this. I can't. What do you

344
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:47,859
mean I can't use this tool? Why not? How was that? What am I supposed to... Fuck. Okay. I have to

345
01:16:47,859 --> 01:16:57,399
use regular ladders. Put it, put this away. Put this away. Use the other ladder to get... Oh god

346
01:16:57,399 --> 01:17:32,300
dammit. Don't give me stupid ideas. Okay. That's fine. Is this thing in water? I don't understand.

347
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:44,180
No shit. How do I spin it? Mouse scroll wheel? Wait, what? Middle mouse button change adjustment.

348
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:57,159
Okay. Here we go. Good. Right there. All right. It's in perfect position. Give me the hose.

349
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:26,890
Attach it. Climb the ladder. Use the ladder. All right. Let's fucking go. I can't jump.

350
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:41,939
Hose on ladder. Put the hose on the ladder. Hose on the ladder. Hose on... Wait. I don't know what

351
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:46,420
you mean. There's a hose on the ladder. Wait. What do you mean there's a hose on the ladder?

352
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:57,609
Bring up a fire extinguisher. There's a hose on the ladder. What? What are you talking about?

353
01:18:57,609 --> 01:19:23,420
There's a hose on the ladder? What do you mean apparently? It's built in. Am I even going to make

354
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:40,939
it from here? Oh my god. There is a hose on the fucking ladder. How do I use the hose? All right.

355
01:19:40,939 --> 01:20:10,359
I'm gonna pull this back. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm just a giant shower. Did I do it? All right. I'm almost...

356
01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:19,449
This is the stupidest thing.

357
01:20:26,649 --> 01:20:32,840
So much impractical bullshit. You know what? I feel a little dirty today. I think I'm just

358
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:51,880
time for a shower. I have to get fucking rid of this. Oh no. I don't have to climb all the

359
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:57,260
way back up. I can make it. No. It's gonna have a stupid... I have a stupid fucking hose in my hands.

360
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:08,250
Just get off. Get off and fucking go up the hole. Just put this away. It's not soft locked. Put the

361
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:18,010
hose away. Put the hose... How do I just put the fucking hose away? I just want to put it away.

362
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:39,189
I want to put the hose away. Okay. Let's go. Get off. The truck is on two wheels? Is it really?

363
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:48,039
All right. All right. All right. I've had enough. Yes, I have. I've had enough. You're right. I've

364
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:59,829
had enough. It's over. It's just time to get this done. Wherever this fire is. Where is it?

365
01:22:01,739 --> 01:22:28,119
There it is. Okay. There's more? Is there more? Oh, easy. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

366
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:39,529
I'm just spraying the street now. Where's this other fire? Pull it back. It's gonna go up. That's

367
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:58,789
the problem. It has to go up. People are trying to drive. Okay. Seriously. Stop driving. Somebody's

368
01:22:58,789 --> 01:23:09,210
in control of the actual car. Pull it back. There's a fire right there. I see it. I almost got it

369
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:25,909
right here. Yeah. There it is. There's four more fires here. Where the fuck are these other fires?

370
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:34,140
Seriously. Where are they? Are they still on the roof? Right here? There's one right there,

371
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:51,319
I think. The car is just driving without me. There's so many cars. It's all the same car.

372
01:23:52,920 --> 01:24:16,739
All the same car. There's too many white vans in this universe. All right. Here we go. Am I

373
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:37,260
hitting it? No. There it is. Okay. I got it. Increased traffic. Well, how do I do it? Somebody

374
01:24:37,260 --> 01:25:07,899
give me the data. One more here. Do 100 times traffic. What is it? What is it? Do slash cam

375
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:14,149
one. It was just car 100. You already did it. Yeah. That's a link with all the commands. Hold on.

376
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:28,010
All right. Commands list. Resets the vehicle. TP car. I think I have to put it in brackets.

377
01:25:30,039 --> 01:25:33,399
Okay. So, yeah. So, I'm missing the bracket then. All right. Let's try it.

378
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:59,979
All right. I got to... I don't think I can open up that menu right now. Okay. Slash car 100. Slash car

379
01:26:00,939 --> 01:26:10,229
five. No, guys. I don't think some of these work. Pedestrian number. Example command.

380
01:26:11,369 --> 01:26:26,539
Ped five. No. I don't think these work. Maybe the console commands have to be turned on. I'm

381
01:26:26,539 --> 01:26:29,180
not sure there's a thing in the menu for that. All right. Let me just do this.

382
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:53,420
Where is this? Right there. Get it. All right. Ped 100. It goes in a line one at a time.

383
01:26:54,300 --> 01:27:08,390
There's only one more left. Where is it? Oh, God. Hold on. All right. We're good. We're good.

384
01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:31,430
There's one more right here somewhere. We're in the edge. There it is. Jeremy, you're going to

385
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:35,029
drown people. They're going to... All the fires are out. All right. Turn this off.

386
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:57,560
What? Fire department dispatch. Did I do it? I think I did it. What happens if I collide with

387
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:13,720
myself here? All right. That's fine. All right. Get off. Get off. Container fire. Let's go.

388
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:31,130
How do I get off of this? How am I going to get out of here? Are those commands in effect right

389
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:39,539
now? They might be. Because there's a shitload of cars here right now. Can't use this. I have to

390
01:28:39,539 --> 01:29:10,250
put the mask away. I put this away. Additional. I mean, get rid of my mask. Okay. It's up.

391
01:29:13,909 --> 01:29:25,289
God damn it. Do ped 100. All right. Slash ped 100. I just did it. I did it. I don't know

392
01:29:25,289 --> 01:29:40,170
what's going to happen, but I did it. Okay. Let's go. Where's this water even coming from?

393
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:49,300
What am I... Right. Fuck. All right. Right. Right. Right. That makes sense. That makes sense.

394
01:29:49,300 --> 01:30:04,500
I just drove in a perfect spot to get stuck. I have to drive as if that's the front of the car.

395
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:15,220
Pedestrian 100. I don't see that many more pedestrians. Do you? I don't see any more

396
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:25,770
pedestrians. You're watering people. There's nobody even on the roof here.

397
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:46,890
Pedestrian 1000. I don't think that shit works. I really don't think that works.

398
01:30:49,659 --> 01:31:23,109
All right. I got this one. All right. Good. Easy. All right. What's next? Anything else?

399
01:31:32,699 --> 01:31:38,699
I don't know why I'm trying to chase this person to carwash them. No, this is just how they make

400
01:31:38,699 --> 01:31:54,020
every Hollywood movie, guys. When it's raining out and there's a big chase scene. Give me another

401
01:31:54,020 --> 01:32:04,149
call. What's going on here? All right. Building fire. You got it. It's right here. In fact,

402
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:08,899
I'm going to change this up a little bit. Give me one sec. I'm going to make this a little easier.

403
01:32:08,899 --> 01:32:33,029
I have to aim the ladder in a little bit higher. So we're going to pull it up.

404
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:41,720
It's got to be like a cannon. I will do all these missions instantly. Ready? Watch this.

405
01:32:42,439 --> 01:32:58,789
Okay. Then put it up and we go. Maybe a little bit higher like that. That should be good. Maybe

406
01:32:58,789 --> 01:33:23,930
a little bit right there. All right. We're good. Lock it. Let's go. And then stupid blinker is on

407
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:39,880
again. Don't go under an overpass. That's right. Don't go under an overpass. Uh-huh. That's a good

408
01:33:39,880 --> 01:34:02,920
call, chat. Uh-huh. Good, good call. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Body, let's get out of here. Okay, Fred. I'll fix

409
01:34:15,859 --> 01:35:00,779
it. Uh, I'm just going to staple this thing. Uh-oh. Oh dear. There we go. Not so hard, is it?

410
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:15,260
Not so hard. Not so hard. All right. Now I just have to turn it a little bit more like this and

411
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:22,140
then up. Okay. Bring it down actually a little bit. Don't drive under an overpass. Don't be a

412
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:40,869
fucking idiot. I can't... Why would you have punching? All right. No overpass. I gotta go this

413
01:35:40,869 --> 01:35:48,710
way. Don't... No emotion for two minutes. Why would I do that right now? I'm full of emotion at the

414
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:59,300
moment. This is a very... This is... I'm full of... I'm full of it. All right. Let's go. No overpass.

415
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:05,220
No overpass. Oh no. Overpass. Wait. I got... Okay. I guess I got miraged. I thought that was two

416
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:17,319
next to each other. I really thought there was two right next to each other. Okay. God damn it. What

417
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:24,569
the fuck? I thought they were... Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. This is where I was.

418
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:33,140
It was... The perspective was like this. Like... I was like right here. Look. I thought they were

419
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:39,930
both the same part of the road. Look. See how they're connected? Ah. So I'm like, oh shit. I

420
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:44,180
have to go all the way around. I have to go around this. He was blind as a bat. No. That's... No.

421
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:50,180
That's real. Because I actually do... If I have... If I have sound available, I can hear better.

422
01:36:50,979 --> 01:36:55,140
I would get... Fucking idiot. I can see better if I can hear what's happening.

423
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:16,949
I think... Okay. I'm... I might be fucked here. Can I push it back on? I think I'm fucked. Yep.

424
01:37:16,949 --> 01:37:26,840
All right. We're going to do something drastic. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I feel

425
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:30,680
like I'm not even trying to do this. You know what I mean? Like I'm... I can't... You get stuck on a

426
01:37:30,680 --> 01:38:15,479
curve. Ugh. All right. Here we go. Okay. Done. Pull it in. All right. I don't know if it's just me,

427
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:19,319
but it's like the running water is starting to give me anxiety. Is anyone getting anxiety

428
01:38:19,319 --> 01:38:30,390
from this water being on the whole time? I kind of am. All right. Let's go. All right. See? Look.

429
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:47,930
Ugh. All right. We're good. Right there. The diner is on fire again. It's the same diner.

430
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:54,020
All right. Are we in the right spot? Kind of. I don't want to do this... I don't want to put

431
01:38:54,020 --> 01:39:11,000
this out again. This is... This is the same one. I don't want to do this one again. Why is there a

432
01:39:11,079 --> 01:39:27,109
chainsaw? Okay. Water hose. Let's go attach it. Here we go. Get in. Fires. Where are they?

433
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,659
And I... What? I want to rescue these people this time. Actually rescue.

434
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:45,619
Is it just the top of the building that's on fire? Oh, come on. Really? What about this side? All

435
01:39:45,619 --> 01:40:12,949
right. This right here. You're cleaning the windows. No, I'm trying... It is outside. I was right.

436
01:40:13,909 --> 01:40:32,600
I was right. I was right. I was right. I was right. So what the fuck? Let me know water supply.

437
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:44,229
Did I use it all? Dude, get out of the way. Move. Oh my God. You drive me fucking crazy. Get out of

438
01:40:44,229 --> 01:41:07,989
the way. Move. Chainsaw. Hydrant. All right. Hydrant. That's not how this works. Water supply

439
01:41:07,989 --> 01:41:37,109
hose. Okay. Now water hose. All right. Let's go. All right. Is there any of the jobs to do besides

440
01:41:37,109 --> 01:41:53,140
just spray the same building over and over again? Forspawn them with cheats. Cheats don't really

441
01:41:53,140 --> 01:42:04,920
work. I haven't been able to get them to work. These fires are in like some strange places.

442
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:17,579
Drive. What? Yeah. What does someone have the cheats? That's not that. Where is this fire?

443
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:32,390
Where's this fire? I can see it, but I can't hit it. Right there. I'm... I know it's right here,

444
01:42:32,390 --> 01:43:01,500
but what the hell is going on? All right. Let me look at the cheats. I want to spawn... I want

445
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:09,319
to spawn a different mission. Okay. So a command to force the next mission is set. It does not

446
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:21,189
force the call. It will appear still at random. Cannot be the same twice in a row. Okay. So next

447
01:43:21,189 --> 01:43:32,119
mission underscore ID equals... Oh, no. Underscore ID. Next mission underscore ID. No, no. Just

448
01:43:32,119 --> 01:43:42,810
next mission underscore aggressive driver. This is police. Okay. Fire. Container fire. Building

449
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:52,819
fire. Vehicle fire. Driver trap. Driver trapped. Cat in a tree. Cat in a tree? Okay. That's kind

450
01:43:52,819 --> 01:44:14,659
of cool. Let's try to do that. Cat in a tree is 2,000. I wonder if it's going to work. Try M

451
01:44:14,659 --> 01:44:29,060
cancel. M... What was it? M cancel? Dash cancel? Oh, shit. It does work. All right. So the cheats do

452
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:49,989
kind of work. Vehicle fire. No, skip. All right. Let's do cat. Cat. I want a new one of these. I

453
01:44:49,989 --> 01:45:10,569
don't want this anymore. What else we got? Oh, cat stuck in a tree. There it is. Boys and girls,

454
01:45:10,569 --> 01:45:16,489
cat stuck in a tree. Freddy Dredd just dropped a fucking hundred subs. What? Freddy. Holy fuck,

455
01:45:16,489 --> 01:45:29,750
Freddy. Freddy coming in hot again with 100. And they're... They are... Oh, boy. That's a...

456
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:43,189
That is 100 tier 2 subs. That's tier 2. That's a lot. That's a lot of money.

457
01:45:43,909 --> 01:45:58,170
Tier 2. And the thing is, I don't even have any tier 2 stuff. Holy shit, Freddy. That is

458
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:09,659
even more to the ridiculous amount of fucking money that you've given this stream. Post the

459
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:18,579
golden beer. I'm not even sure... Is that still for 10 bucks? Where's my... I'm trapped. Hold on.

460
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:31,859
I need to get in that building. So I do have... No, I don't. Isn't that... That's a regular one,

461
01:46:31,859 --> 01:46:38,100
isn't it? All right. How do I get into the fire department? Time for you to upgrade. There it is.

462
01:46:40,729 --> 01:46:45,770
Okay. Cat stuck in a tree. I want to spawn just a regular vehicle. Nothing insane. We're going to

463
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:55,989
heal. $1,000 in one draw. Yeah, that's fucking crazy. Freddy, I can't thank you enough. That's

464
01:46:55,989 --> 01:47:04,500
ridiculous. All right. We're just going to do fire department carb one. Or... No, let's do the...

465
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:24,420
Should we do every children's toy? Yeah. Honestly, the cat was up in that tree the whole time.

466
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:33,220
Phylactery. And not to be overshadowed. Phylactery with another 75. So... 75. 69. 75 stuck in my brain.

467
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:48,920
You guys. Seriously. Holy fuck. All right. Let me put... Phylactery. Thanks for the 69 fucking subs.

468
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:57,449
Let's go save a cat. We're going to start to be compound subbing. People are going to be

469
01:47:57,449 --> 01:48:01,369
subbed two different times. People are going to get tier... Can you get tier one and tier two at

470
01:48:01,369 --> 01:48:16,020
the same time? Holy shit. But seriously, both of you and anybody that subs this channel. We

471
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:21,140
talked about it on the New Year's Eve stream, but there's been so much support on this channel.

472
01:48:22,569 --> 01:48:37,850
I just... I'm fucking flabbergasted. All right. How do I get the cat out of the tree? Do I have to

473
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:52,979
climb the tree with my hands? Where is the cat? I don't see a cat. No cat to return. Ladder. Climb

474
01:48:52,979 --> 01:49:02,810
to... Okay. Cut the tree down. Wait. What? Hold on. Cut the tree down. They don't do this. Don't they

475
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:44,199
go up? What? What do you mean cut the tree down? Okay. Here's your... Thank you for calling the

476
01:49:44,199 --> 01:49:54,859
fire department. Appreciate it. Have a good rest of your day. Oh my God. Okay. Can we do... I want

477
01:49:54,859 --> 01:50:01,479
to do the cat. I want to do the cat stuck in the tree again. These are fun. These ones are good.

478
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:20,220
Okay. I want to actually fire... Building fire. No. Skip. I want to actually go climb the tree. I

479
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:34,439
didn't know you could even do that. He's stalling? What? Who's... Oh, this person's in the way.

480
01:50:34,439 --> 01:50:47,979
He's stalling. No, I want to see the rest of the... I want to see the... You want to see stalling? I'll

481
01:50:47,979 --> 01:51:13,750
show you fucking stalling. You really want to see what stalling looks like? Sure. What happened?

482
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:32,359
We should go... Oh, never mind. All right. Cat a tree. Let's go. Oh, I'm not doing it right. Cat

483
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:49,529
stuck in a tree. Okay. Is it her? Let's just... This time just run the tree over with your truck.

484
01:51:50,810 --> 01:52:08,949
Oh, that's so loud. Stop. Get away from me. You're putting on a siren for a cat. Yeah, this is an

485
01:52:08,949 --> 01:52:13,750
emergency. What if the cat like fell? But what if somebody cut the tree down with the chainsaw?

486
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:40,619
I gotta be prepared. I gotta be ready. I think I can do it. No. No. No. Don't. Don't. Don't. I think

487
01:52:40,619 --> 01:52:51,819
I can do it. I really think it's possible. I do. All right. So it's not possible. Fuck it. Whatever.

488
01:52:51,819 --> 01:52:55,659
You were right. I was wrong. I was wrong. You were right. I was wrong. You were right. And I will

489
01:52:55,659 --> 01:53:01,260
admit that. That's fine. I thought that it was possible that I could go up and over. I might be

490
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:11,800
able to, but okay. Fine. No, you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. It's good to

491
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:27,449
try. You gotta try at least once. I hate going up here. Oh, that's right. There is still police

492
01:53:27,449 --> 01:53:57,960
missions to do. What is that? Why do you have the Hollywood Hills place from GTA 5 here? And there's

493
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:19,100
always missions over here. All right. There's the tree. Let's go. Enough bullshit. I'm climbing up

494
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:28,739
there and I'm going to get the cat myself. There we are. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. I have

495
01:54:29,239 --> 01:54:44,310
to go all the way around. Don't even think about it. You're going to get stuck. Okay. I'm here.

496
01:54:48,340 --> 01:55:01,079
Cat's stuck in a tree. All right. What seems to be the problem? Found the cat. All right. Cat right

497
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:26,729
here. Give me the ladder. All right. Rescue. Ladder. Looks good. I'm going up. Come here.

498
01:55:26,729 --> 01:55:45,779
There you are. Got you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit. I was going to...

499
01:55:46,659 --> 01:55:53,819
You were going to be my partner. No, I was going to put you in like the front seat and it was

500
01:55:53,819 --> 01:56:08,170
going to be like a funny movie, like a Disney movie. Stop. Come here. Save. I saved the cat.

501
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:39,140
Who cares? That's two failed cats. That's two rescued cats, actually. There's another cat?

502
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:52,069
Why is there another cat in the tree? You have two cats. Okay. Well, you have two cats.

503
01:56:52,069 --> 01:57:00,630
Probably you're doing business with you. All right. Let's go. You didn't have clearance to do that?

504
01:57:03,829 --> 01:57:13,460
It was violating... She was violating her neighbor's yard. Vehicle fire. No. All right.

505
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:20,859
What's any other good ones for fire? Driver trapped? All right. How about driver trapped?

506
01:57:20,859 --> 01:57:41,380
We'll try this one. I don't know. 18. Oh, here comes the cliff joke. All right. Okay. Let's

507
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:49,079
do... I want to see driver trapped and then we'll do police. I promise. Vehicle incident. No. That's

508
01:57:49,079 --> 01:58:00,020
not it. 18. I'm going to stay up here for a second because just in case it's up here.

509
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:15,659
I'm not doing this again. Wait, that was it? I thought that was a... Oh, that was it. You monster.

510
01:58:15,659 --> 01:58:20,140
All right. I thought it was vehicle. I thought it was like vehicle incident, not like driver.

511
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:25,720
I don't know. We've seen like a bunch of vehicle incidents in the same thing. Building fire. No.

512
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:51,619
Okay. Let's do it. And then it was 18. Come on. Drive that guy off the road. I'm not going to do

513
01:58:51,619 --> 01:59:05,529
that. Come on. Let's go. All right. Driver trapped. Yes. Where is it? I knew I should have stayed

514
01:59:05,529 --> 01:59:13,800
here. Right? See? I told you. Wait, where is that? No, that's really far away. Is this a beach in

515
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:20,420
this game? This place... Why is everything in this same... This is a huge map. Jesus. This is actually

516
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:34,380
a giant map. Like that was not meant to be a joke. I'm serious. Like that was just quicker to get

517
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:42,149
down here. That's not... Oh, look at me. I'm jumping off a cliff. No, that's... I'm just trying

518
01:59:42,149 --> 02:00:05,770
to get here fast. Minus one. Yeah, I know. That's fine. You can do that. Explaining the joke doesn't

519
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:27,859
make it funny. It would have taken me so much time. Wrong way. I know. I... This is how I drive in

520
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:35,140
I'm telling you. I'm sorry. It happens every single time I play any game. I drive on the other side

521
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:40,739
of the road. Something about it is easier for my brain to understand. In a video game. Like I drive

522
02:00:40,739 --> 02:00:50,260
my car every fucking day. Let's be realistic here. I don't... I don't know why. And I missed the turn

523
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:57,819
because I'm sitting here just yapping. I can't even go over the medium. I have to turn around.

524
02:01:00,779 --> 02:01:10,970
I have to turn around. God damn it. I gotta spin this car around. Admit it. You have a butler drive

525
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:31,989
you places. I don't have a butler. Get the fuck over here. I gotta go... Who put these cones in?

526
02:01:31,989 --> 02:01:36,710
There's not even any construction. Fuck. No. Why does this have to keep happening to me?

527
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:41,350
I can't even... Why does this have to happen to me? This keeps happening to me.

528
02:01:42,229 --> 02:01:45,670
When things like this keep happening to you, you're the problem. You know what I mean? Like

529
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:52,539
I'm the problem here. This... Oh wait. Why did I get stuck here? When it happens every time,

530
02:01:52,539 --> 02:02:14,229
the problem I think is probably you. You know? It's me. All right. Fuck off with this. He's driving

531
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:20,470
on the wrong side of the road and he finally... He says maybe I'm the problem. Not right there.

532
02:02:21,189 --> 02:02:34,779
I was driving normally there. Is this a Sim City highway? And these carriages all over the place,

533
02:02:34,779 --> 02:02:41,140
aren't they? All right. Vehicle... Vehicle incident. Here we are. What's the problem?

534
02:02:50,300 --> 02:03:15,239
I don't know. Somebody's... Who's trapped? Oh, okay. What is it called? A spreader? This just looks

535
02:03:15,239 --> 02:03:47,239
like a camel spider. Okay. How do I get it in? Now what? Okay. Got it. How do I put this... All right.

536
02:03:47,239 --> 02:03:56,020
Now get him out. What? Do I have to pull him out? Why do I have to pull him out? Aren't you an EMT?

537
02:03:56,020 --> 02:04:05,939
Where'd you get that cool EMT outfit? Interact using medbag. That's you. That's this person's

538
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:37,579
job. I don't have a medbag. What? Yeah. Wait. Hold on. I have to do this? Breathing. Conscious.

539
02:04:37,579 --> 02:04:55,109
Possible neck injury. Yeah. I got you. Wait. What did that say? Okay. Do CPR? I don't think I can do

540
02:04:55,109 --> 02:05:05,449
CPR while he's inside of the car. You can't perform CPR on this person. Can't use this.

541
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:38,140
How do I do CPR? What's this guy doing? Why is he doing like mime work? Tree blocking road. I'll take

542
02:05:38,140 --> 02:06:05,270
it. I can't move. Okay. There we go. All right. No, no, no. Time to... I want to be a police officer.

543
02:06:05,270 --> 02:06:10,359
Did you just get in my car? What the fuck? No. All right. I want to be a police officer. Let's go.

544
02:06:10,359 --> 02:07:01,100
And then we can move on. I'm interested though. How do I TP? TP slash HQ. Here we go. All right.

545
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:33,289
Let's go to the police department. He's cheating? Yes. Sorry. I'm cheating in flashing lights. Is

546
02:07:33,289 --> 02:07:41,159
there a single game that you don't cheat in? Wait. Why is everybody so concerned about me teleporting?

547
02:07:44,779 --> 02:07:59,859
I'm just TP. I'm not using cheats right now. All right. Here we go. Wait. Okay. Change to police.

548
02:08:04,789 --> 02:08:34,420
Okay. Let's do tall guy. Hat. And shades. No. Wait. I'm going to get VAC banned. Office of Jecks.

549
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:41,380
This isn't supposed to be a fantasy game. Yes it is. Because it's something I'm not doing in real

550
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:47,109
life. All right. What's here? What's going on here? Register suspect. All right. Select vehicle. What

551
02:08:47,109 --> 02:09:02,470
do I want for a car? Police car. Police car. This one. Get the tank. Oh, there it goes. Armed robbery

552
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:28,300
in progress. Let's go. It's in progress right now. Like right here. This car is fast. Really fast

553
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:36,520
actually. All right. Armed robbery. Here we go. How do you arrest people? Oh no. Armed robbery at

554
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:42,359
the diner. This diner. It would suck to be somebody that worked. They're shooting at me? It's the same

555
02:09:42,359 --> 02:10:01,850
dot. How do I use a gun? All right. Wait. Wait. Trunk. Weapon two. What? I don't know. People are

556
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:19,779
running at me. I don't know. Why do you have a fan in here? What? Wait. Can I get revived by a BMT?

557
02:10:23,369 --> 02:10:38,619
Wait. Suspect on foot. Suspect on foot. Suspect on foot. Quick. Get me. Get me. Get me. Get me. Get

558
02:10:38,619 --> 02:10:43,590

559
02:10:43,590 --> 02:10:48,739
She's not getting away. She ain't getting away. Revive me. Why is there a fan in here? What are

560
02:10:48,739 --> 02:10:58,659
they doing? Let's go. Come on. They're gonna get away. I have to arrest them. How do I say like

561
02:10:58,659 --> 02:11:27,369
you're under arrest? Am I not gonna be... Am I dead? Permanently. What just happened? Come on.

562
02:11:27,369 --> 02:11:33,159
Give me like ten. I think they're fucked up. All right. I have to respawn at the station.

563
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:42,970
I can't. The whole thing is fucked up actually. Yeah. It's all fucked up. I can't. R is not doing

564
02:11:42,970 --> 02:12:00,539
anything anymore. I'm gonna TP. All right. TP. TP HQ. The suspect is coming back. What?

565
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:11,350
Dead body TP. Is the suspect gonna come back into the diner? Shit. Okay. How do I like... Is there

566
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:39,739
any like force... They're coming back down here. Somebody stop that person. Okay. I'm dead. Oh,

567
02:12:39,739 --> 02:12:44,680
it's over. Is there like a force reset or something? What is it? How do I like force

568
02:12:44,680 --> 02:13:00,229
reset? There's gotta be something here. Car. Reset. The resets vehicle. Cancels mission.

569
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:18,699
All right. So M cancel. Let's try M cancel. Okay. And then V reset. Can I fucking come back to life?

570
02:13:18,699 --> 02:13:42,970
There's a fight going on in progress. No. God damn it. Come on. Wait. Where's the fight? There's a

571
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:50,920
fight in progress? Where's the fight? All right. Come on. Robot. Oh boy. All right. All right. I

572
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:54,279

573
02:13:54,279 --> 02:14:06,010
a sec. Let's get an alt F4. I'm gonna spawn as a cop. It's fine. Yeah. I can press R and do anything.

574
02:14:06,010 --> 02:14:10,460
It's all good. I'm coming right back. That was only one mission. That's not fair.

575
02:14:11,779 --> 02:14:22,359
Coming back. Here we are. Why is my car flipped? It's because I spawned it in front of me or

576
02:14:22,359 --> 02:14:30,710
something weird. I have no idea. Okay. Let's go. You want this as high as possible. 99.

577
02:14:31,829 --> 02:14:36,390
99. Don't matter. Parked vehicle density. Medium. Time of day. Fuel consumption. Who cares?

578
02:14:41,699 --> 02:14:45,300
Don't read this. I don't know. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna read the rest of that. Whatever it was.

579
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:54,579
Have I ever played city skylines? I have never played city skylines and I've never played sim

580
02:14:54,579 --> 02:15:05,750
city. I have no idea. I've seen random stuff. I feel like I'm too stupid to play it.

581
02:15:14,069 --> 02:15:17,750
You're not. I feel like it's too. I have to learn a lot and I'm not. I'm too

582
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:23,829
all over the place to be able to learn it correctly. He played sim city on DOS and it was a disaster

583
02:15:23,829 --> 02:15:27,430
and I played it for like 15 minutes and realized I was not going to be able to. I was incapable.

584
02:15:28,310 --> 02:15:38,039
City skylines is easy. All right. Well, put it on the list. I have 60 PC games and Wii games and

585
02:15:38,039 --> 02:15:47,109
and GameCube games and PS2 games. I've got so many games. You have no idea. All right. Let's go.

586
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:59,750
Aggressive driver in red vehicle. Ram or pit? All right. Let's go. Aggressive driver.

587
02:16:08,010 --> 02:16:15,210
Use spike strips? We're gonna have to try that. All right. Where are they? All the way down there.

588
02:16:16,170 --> 02:16:23,590
Give me a break. Do I really have to go all the way down there? Is this game one of them? This game

589
02:16:23,590 --> 02:16:28,390
was one of them. This is one of like 62 games. Wait. Open the map. Where is it? All right. Down

590
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:46,950
this way. Oh, this was recommended. I pulled a lot of these from the recommended channel. So

591
02:16:47,829 --> 02:17:02,440
this was on there more than once. I'm going 120. All right. Where are you at? Aggressive driver.

592
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:08,360
Block the car. Ram it or use spike strips? Am I supposed to use spike? I think I could go in front

593
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:37,139
of them. I could go in front of them and do spike strips. Where are they? This person wasn't even

594
02:17:37,139 --> 02:17:48,090
aggressive. They were driving normally. You were driving normal. All right. Get out of the car.

595
02:17:49,049 --> 02:17:59,540
Out. Get out of the car. All right. Out. Get out of the car. Driving recklessly. Get out of the car.

596
02:18:00,549 --> 02:18:09,139
Suspect compliance. Okay. What do you mean suspect compliance? Arrest? You got on ran.

597
02:18:09,139 --> 02:18:19,909
All right. Come here. How do I interact? Wait. Okay. Arrest? How do you arrest?

598
02:18:21,559 --> 02:18:37,770
Ask? Wait. Hold on. Alcohol test. Blow into this. All right. Okay. Let's. Hold on. Interact.

599
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:51,690
You're under arrest. No, I can't. Come here. Ask for your ID. What was it? Brandy Alvarez. Okay.

600
02:18:52,250 --> 02:19:03,530
Wait here. Okay. Handcuffs. You're under arrest. Okay. Let's go.

601
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:42,170
I don't know. Not in the trunk. No. No. No. Hold on. I need to be standing out of the way.

602
02:19:48,469 --> 02:20:00,360
Oh, come on. Oh, well. Wait. What am I actually? No, I'm not. What? What? What you? Why can you do

603
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:08,280
that? Why can you do that? Why can you do that? You should not be able to do that

604
02:20:09,719 --> 02:20:19,719
as a police officer. Why are they in the trunk? Okay. What? Why is this still on the list?

605
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:35,430
Block the car? Oh my god. Why? Hold on a minute. I am so confused. I can't believe you can do this.

606
02:20:44,340 --> 02:21:11,590
Why? There's no reason for that. No, no. I'm taken. I'm under arrest. Why is it still happening?

607
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Seriously. I need to ask a real question. Why is it still happening?

608
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:39,909
She's under arrest. Why is there green blip still on the screen? Oh, request a tow. Okay. All right.

609
02:21:40,629 --> 02:22:15,370
All right, let's go. That's gonna be done, right? This car fucking screams. Not into the ocean. Not

610
02:22:15,370 --> 02:22:36,409
into the ocean. Not into the ocean. Locate and stop. I did it. Suspect neutralized.

611
02:23:00,969 --> 02:23:09,620
The car. The car is gonna arrest yourself. Transport to courthouse.

612
02:23:09,620 --> 02:23:35,750
You got it. Who? Oh, get out of the car. Get out. Out. Out. Quick. I'm fine. Who needs to go to the

613
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:54,440
courthouse? Pick up at police station at the back entrance. Do we have a car? Oh, okay.

614
02:23:54,440 --> 02:24:06,170
Transport suspect. There he is. Come here. You got anything on you? I don't know. You got nothing

615
02:24:06,170 --> 02:24:14,600
up your nose? Okay, that's good to know. Cool. All right. Handcuff this fucking guy. All right.

616
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:25,559
Breathe into this. Okay, fine. Return your item. Okay, let's go. Commands. Follow me.

617
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:47,399
Don't try anything fucking crazy. Wait. What do I have to bring him? Transport to... Oh, I'm... Okay,

02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:46,860
All right. Get in the car. Come with me. Let's go. Yeah, I got this guy's ready for his court date.

621
02:25:47,819 --> 02:25:54,629
Open up the fucking trunk. It'd be like, what the fuck are you doing, dude? Ah, you know,

622
02:25:55,590 --> 02:26:06,940
I was transporting. All right. Shit. No, no, it's all right. Don't worry. I poked like six

623
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:18,889
air holes in the trunk. Where is this? Wait, what? Okay. Wait, do we have to watch this guy's trial?

624
02:26:19,450 --> 02:26:50,340
All right. Let's go. What is going on? I don't... I don't think that's such a good idea.

625
02:26:53,799 --> 02:27:03,899
That's not a great idea. You go out a little bit. You go out a little. You go out. Guy's out of

626
02:27:03,899 --> 02:27:08,459
bullets. He's out of bullets. He's out of bullets. He's out of bullets. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Give

02:27:45,159 --> 02:27:49,879
Wait, wait, wait. How do I... You guys are all a bald guy with a tank top.

02:27:52,360 --> 02:28:13,559
Wait, stop. Get this off. Shut this down. Hey, don't move. Freeze. Come here. Get up. Get up.

This is Eddie Scott. Let's go, Eddie. Get in here. Aw. Get in there. Wait, who the fuck are you,

639
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:51,049

640
02:30:51,049 --> 02:31:08,760

Possible drunk driver. Where? Reports of erratic driver to pull over any suspected

655
02:34:09,379 --> 02:34:19,190
drivers and check alcohol levels. What? Follow vehicle plus left control? Wait, somebody's drunk driving?

He's gonna get away. He's gonna get away. No.

676
02:38:40,620 --> 02:38:44,860
like a fucking idiot. So how am I supposed to tell who's drunk driving? You know what I'm saying?

677
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:51,000
Like everyone's bumping. How am I supposed to tell? It's definitely this guy. It's this guy

678
02:38:51,000 --> 02:39:01,940
right here. Like it's this dude. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's you.

All right. I have a license registration please. Okay. Um, any alcohol? Why can I say this? Tests.

680
02:39:11,370 --> 02:39:25,620
Uh, I want to do an alcohol test on you please. Result zero. How is that possible? What? What?

681
02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:37,819
Did you see, you saw how she was driving, right? Look at this shit. Did I just get

682
02:39:37,819 --> 02:39:47,350
the gay baited by the game? She was going left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

683
02:39:49,180 --> 02:40:08,889
I'm never going to find this person. Am I? Wait, did I, what did I say? Be gated, get baited?

684
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:22,020
What? What? Wait, what did I say? Get baited. I said you baited. Clip it. I want to hear it. What?

685
02:40:25,959 --> 02:40:37,190
You said gay baited. Wow. Get baited. I need to hear it. That's fucking crazy.

686
02:40:43,379 --> 02:41:03,530
I said it as two words. I get baited. I need to hear it. That's not you guys. That's incorrect.

687
02:41:10,739 --> 02:41:20,870
No, that's me saying Eddie. I should, I'm going to have to skip this one because this,

688
02:41:20,870 --> 02:41:28,600
I don't think I'm going to be able to do this. I'm so, I'm so confused.

689
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:51,750
Baited by the game? I say game. All right. All right. Let's go. I was going to say,

690
02:41:51,750 --> 02:41:54,149
why would I say that? Why would I say it like that? That's odd.

691
02:41:55,110 --> 02:42:20,090
All right. I'm going to follow this person. Turn off the sirens. I'm not even in the area anymore.

692
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:38,940
Am I even going to be able to find this person? I don't think I'm going to be able to find this

693
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:52,680
person. I'm going to have to skip this one. 0.0. All right. Have, goodbye. Free to go. Goodbye.

694
02:42:55,430 --> 02:43:24,280
I'm never going to find this. I have to skip this one. Yeah. Oh, you, yeah. You can play

695
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:35,700
this game online. Yeah, I know. I wasn't sure how stable it was. What about that person?

696
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:46,260
Respond code one with your police radio. Wait, how do I do that? How do I open up that thing

697
02:43:46,260 --> 02:44:05,540
that I had? No, not that. What was that? How did I get that menu? Come here. Pull over. Pull over.

698
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:30,250
Catch the fleeing suspect. I knew something was up. That didn't take very long. God damn it. Come

699
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:53,559
on. Really? Is somebody still in my trunk? Get in the car. All right. You're under, stay flipped

700
02:44:53,559 --> 02:45:30,579
over. You're under arrest. He's going to keep, motherfucker. You're in fucking, you're in deep

701
02:45:30,579 --> 02:46:09,100
shit. Okay. Into the trunk. Always into the trunk. Like this guy. I thought about it, but there's a

702
02:46:09,100 --> 02:46:14,459
barrier. Nope. I'm going to do, what are some of the other police missions that I could just have

703
02:46:14,459 --> 02:46:25,739
set up? Let's see. There's, I want to fight. I want to, see, I want to see the one that's a fight.

704
02:46:26,219 --> 02:47:17,430
It's the fire department. Get out. Get out. You're going to fucking jail. Let's go. I just want to see

705
02:47:17,430 --> 02:47:25,590
what they do. All right. This guy, book him. Book this guy. Oh, come on. Do I really have to go all

706
02:47:25,590 --> 02:47:38,100
the way around? I just want to see what it does. I'm just going to test it on myself. Here we go.

707
02:47:38,100 --> 02:47:46,700
Book him. Frisk the suspect. All right. What do you got on you? You got a weapon on you?

708
02:47:46,700 --> 02:47:55,739
Oh, this is an ID card. That's it. All right. Book him. First name, Jonathan. Last name,

709
02:47:55,739 --> 02:48:00,780
signature. David too. You got it. All right. Let's go. All right. I want to do fight.

710
02:48:01,659 --> 02:48:14,229
What is it? Uh, M N M M N. Oh, let's do fight. And I'm going to take a pee break

711
02:48:15,030 --> 02:48:22,920
and I'll come back and see what we're going to do. Let's test these strips. They don't work on me.

712
02:48:34,819 --> 02:48:47,850
Fight in progress. Okay. Where, where's this fight in progress? Oh, it's all the way down here.

713
02:48:48,809 --> 02:49:07,260
It's hard to turn. It's just the GTA five map. Is it really? No, it's not.

714
02:49:09,799 --> 02:49:23,260
Is it? I'm confused. Is it really? All right. Is it, was this fight fight in progress? All right.

02:49:23,260 --> 02:50:08,459
Um, oh, she's not shooting at me. Okay. Herman, you're in trouble. Weapon. What's the weapon?

716
02:50:08,459 --> 02:50:22,489
What's the weapon? Actions. Get weapon. How do I get the weapon? Give me the weapon.

717
02:50:22,489 --> 02:50:38,389
Let's give it back. Hold on. Stop. Stop. Stop. Just, okay. Come here. Stop. Oh, I can actually say

718
02:50:38,389 --> 02:51:06,620

722
02:51:47,219 --> 02:51:50,739
I've been playing this for three hours. I'm still enjoying it though, for some reason. I don't know

02:51:50,739 --> 02:52:08,790
why I still, what is this? What the hell is this? What is this? Oh, it's a taser. It's a remote

725
02:52:19,979 --> 02:52:40,010
I didn't know I had all these weapons. All right. Tase the last game blue time for Nancy Drew. No,

726
02:52:40,010 --> 02:52:57,110
no, no, no, no, no. Don't piss yourself. I'll be fine. No, no, Nancy Drew. Not today. Not today.

727
02:52:58,459 --> 02:53:07,239
All right. Tase. How far does it go? This is that person with a gun. Okay. There's a person with

right. I don't want to have to do this. Traffic cop.

730
02:53:48,309 --> 02:54:23,430
I got one last parking ticket down before I went. Okay. The person has a dozen bullet holes in their

731
02:54:23,430 --> 02:54:32,299
car and they come back to a parking ticket. Oh, that's fucked up. All right. This guy's mine.

732
02:54:32,940 --> 02:55:05,479
Where'd you go? Wait, he's across this way. Hold on. Here he comes. All right. Very easy.

733
02:55:05,479 --> 02:55:22,739
Can I say stop? Stop. What's the range on this thing? He's running right to the police station.

734
02:55:22,739 --> 02:55:50,139
I missed. God damn it. It's, you gotta be real close. What? How long is it? All right. Come here.

735
02:55:50,139 --> 02:56:07,739
How do I, you're under arrest. Weapon. All right. Uh, requesting a transport. He's, he's trying to

736
02:56:07,739 --> 02:56:21,270

737
02:56:21,270 --> 02:56:40,469
get you. I don't even know I had this. All right. Let's go. Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no. I'm just

738
02:56:40,469 --> 02:56:51,430
go on your way. It's a bald guy. That's how you know he's a criminal. They can't get over here.

739
02:56:51,430 --> 02:57:31,819
I think the game's broken. Oh, here they go. Here we go. You know what? Whatever. Just,

740
02:57:34,659 --> 02:57:37,879
there we go. Here you go. Good. Very good.

02:57:44,729 --> 02:58:06,200
Okay. Nobody gets like scared. Okay. All right. That's it. I'm going to move on. That's it.

742
02:58:06,200 --> 02:58:15,610
Interact with who? Wait, what? Oh, he's running over the body over and over again. He's stuck on the

743
02:58:15,610 --> 02:58:26,520
guy's body. This is fucked up. Hey. All right. All right. Okay. All right. That's enough. Stop.

744
02:58:27,159 --> 02:58:40,659
Stop. Stop this right now. Stop. Stop the car. Get out of the car. Out of the car. Get out of the car.

745
02:58:41,989 --> 02:59:00,569
Out of the car. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. I don't think this even

746
02:59:00,569 --> 02:59:14,549
does anything. No, this doesn't do anything. This doesn't do anything. The glass doesn't break.

747
02:59:14,549 --> 02:59:25,450
Watch out. All right. I think I've seen everything I can see in this game. This is pretty,

748
02:59:25,450 --> 02:59:39,159
pretty interesting. Has to be from the other side. No, it does not. No. See, it's not doing anything.

749
02:59:44,540 --> 02:59:57,430
All right. Let me go to the bathroom. I'll figure out what we're going to do. Some nice cars.

750
02:59:58,139 --> 03:00:27,139
Wait, what? Oh. Take out all the tires. All right. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out.

751
03:00:27,139 --> 03:00:30,020
I'll be back in a minute. I'm going to go pee and we'll come back and do something else.

752
03:00:35,459 --> 03:00:43,979
I'm trying to exit the game. Okay. I'll be right back.
