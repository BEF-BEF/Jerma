1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:19,989
I know the pieces fit cause I watch them fall away.

2
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:20,789
Hold on.

3
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,049
This is super liminal.

4
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:48,409
So this game suck.

5
00:00:48,409 --> 00:01:03,259
Well, how's this game? Is it good? Is that better?

6
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:08,870
How's that sound? Louder? Shorter? Longer? Whatever you want.

7
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,019
This is a tuber game. All right, this should be fun then.

8
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:15,459
All right, how about the graphics?

9
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,659
Default. Okay, this is probably fine.

10
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:26,200
This is high. Ambient occlusion. Gross.

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:40,409
That's yeah, whatever.

12
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,870
All right, let's go.

13
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,989
Wait, is there FOV?

14
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,739
Ah, thank God. Okay.

15
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,000
Turn this down.

16
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,560
Attention to be refined. Subtitles.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,760
Yeah, 2560 by 1440. What a big ass screen.

18
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, we're turning that up.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,110
I mean, that's not high enough.

20
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,620
Okay, super liminal. Terms of service.

21
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,060
I just, wait, I signed it?

22
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,580
I didn't want to sign it. I just want to look at it.

23
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:29,750
This FOV feels huge.

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,669
You missed the intro.

25
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:43,849
What intro?

26
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,050
You missed the intro.

27
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,949
Who cares? Does it matter?

28
00:02:46,949 --> 00:03:25,780
I'll turn it up.

29
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:35,830
So I see an ad for that and then I go do it.

30
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,889
And I need to, I had to see that so badly.

31
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,520
You could have just told me,

32
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,680
hey, you saw an ad on TV for this place.

33
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,099
Is that better?

34
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:56,629
Now you have context.

35
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:57,270
Yeah, that's true.

36
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:14,969
Let's go ahead and sign it. Sign it with my nose.

37
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,970
Reception is reality. Grab.

38
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:36,120
What? I don't get it.

39
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,250
Okay, because it's making, it's bigger?

40
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:50,680
Yeah, that's trippy.

41
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:59,480
How do I, oh, there we go.

42
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:25,860
Do I, what do I just do? Duck?

43
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,959
Oh, cool. All right.

44
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,180
Okay, I get it.

45
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:39,189
Terms of service accepted.

46
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,589
Congratulations on falling asleep.

47
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,110
Welcome to Somnascult.

48
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,310
Your progress may be monitored by qualified specialists.

49
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,670
This orientation will adapt you to eyelids,

50
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,230
our interactive lucid induction dream state

51
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,269
in which you retain full consciousness and control.

52
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:59,160
What do you want me to do?

53
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,639
Move this?

54
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:13,829
Oh, fuck. What do I do?

55
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:16,250
What? Wait, what?

56
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,319
I don't get it. What just happened?

57
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:29,189
What? Okay.

58
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:38,339
What do I, do I have to play chess?

59
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,089
Okay, put the board here.

60
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,129
No, that's too small.

61
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,740
Um, oh, that's huge.

62
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,620
Do I have to make this big?

63
00:06:48,019 --> 00:07:20,680
Oh, I thought I had to play chess.

64
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:31,160
Shit. It's okay. That works.

65
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,480
No objects beyond this point at all times.

66
00:07:33,480 --> 00:08:30,250
How do I make it big?

67
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,370
Make it look big.

68
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:39,750
Can I like hold it up to my eye?

69
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,070
How do I hold it up to my eye?

70
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,779
Well, that's gone now.

71
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:45,940
I broke the game and I have to restart the whole thing.

72
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,740
Thank God.

73
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,450
How do I, how do I hold it up close?

74
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,330
Distance. Yeah.

75
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,210
Can I crouch?

76
00:08:53,210 --> 00:09:23,129
Is there a way I can pull it forward to look at it closer?

77
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:32,700
Whoa. Well, now what?

78
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,299
What do I do? How, what do I do about it?

79
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,620
How do I get it in there?

80
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,580
From the vent?

81
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,250
How do I get it through? I can't.

82
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,529
How do I put it? Just go through?

83
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,110
I thought I couldn't.

84
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,990
Wait, I'm confused.

85
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,029
I can't bring this through.

86
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,149
So how do I put it here?

87
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:56,299
Put it in the vent?

88
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,600
Yeah, I can't go through the block.

89
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:06,889
So how do I get the, how do I get the block in here?

90
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:07,610
Is there a vent?

91
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:58,330
Oh, sneaky.

92
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,509
Shit. Hold on.

93
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:12,460
No, I want it to be smaller.

94
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,340
Confirmed.

95
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,379
You can move freely, interact with surrounding objects,

96
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,259
and listen to messages from your patient care team.

97
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,759
Please note that I am the standard orientation protocol

98
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,879
and that my voice has been explicitly chosen to remind you

99
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,899
that I am not a part of your patient care team.

100
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,409
I do not care.

101
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:33,370
Whoa, it's big. All right.

102
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,809
So now just go through here.

103
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:52,440
Dude, smoke is coming out of his ears.

104
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:11,509
Hold. Okay.

105
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,259
Oh, this is huge.

106
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:32,169
Wow. Oh, is that it?

107
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:36,820
Yeah, kind of.

108
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,179
During eyelids, you will lose the ability to awaken suddenly

109
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,679
due to realizing that this is a dream.

110
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,279
Evidence. I have already informed you that this is a dream.

111
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,559
You did not wake up.

112
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:51,259
Please complete the remaining orientation activities.

113
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,289
I feel like I'm going to...

114
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,200
All right. So what am I doing here?

115
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,620
This has got to be a dream soda.

116
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,460
Warning. You have deviated from the orientation pathway.

117
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,340
At the Pierce Institute, patient safety as a keynote...

118
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,460
We're going to every floor.

119
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,700
A variable degree of force cannon will be authorized

120
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,710
to ensure patient safety.

121
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,029
Please return to the orientation pathway.

122
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:38,259
Oh, that's a tiny little button.

123
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:56,860
All right. How do I make it teeny tiny?

124
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,059
I got to go like this, right?

125
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:08,730
Like, cool.

126
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:20,309
Looks like somebody tried to...

127
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:58,250
I mean, probably just like through here, right?

128
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,750
Yeah.

129
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,070
All environments perceived during eyelids

130
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,309
should reflect a typical mental state.

131
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,750
If you believe your mental state was compromised by somnascope,

132
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,629
please provide a comprehensive, rational explanation

133
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,870
in your post-procedural survey.

134
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:20,120
Completed surveys may be eligible for a gift card.

135
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:28,679
Oh, whoops. Can I put this?

136
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,600
No. I got to throw it over there at the top.

137
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm getting the hang of it. I understand it.

138
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,190
The mold must have rotted his brain.

139
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,909
I'm fine.

140
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:50,730
I just did that faster than probably all of you combined.

141
00:15:50,730 --> 00:16:08,759
What the hell is going on?

142
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:34,169
How do I get out of here?

143
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:35,769
Whoa. All right. Hold on.

144
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,169
I don't know how I can pick this up.

145
00:16:38,169 --> 00:17:12,519
I'm too high for this?

146
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,509
Well, relax.

147
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:15,269
Please stand by for polite recognition

148
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,569
on your completion of the somnascope orientation.

149
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,829
You did it.

150
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,109
To maximize the time allotted for your therapeutic journey,

151
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,190
please do not delay in proceeding through the final doorway as indicated.

152
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:27,829
Final doorway.

153
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,269
We're going to get some portal type shit.

154
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:29,990
Watch this.

155
00:17:29,990 --> 00:18:15,859
I don't get it.

156
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:17,930
I feel like I could grab something through here.

157
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,940
Can't pick up the sign.

158
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:31,900
I would imagine it would be the boxes right here.

159
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:40,180
No. I can't grab the speaker.

160
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:47,430
Sprinkler. No speaker.

161
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,380
I can't grab the bricks.

162
00:18:51,380 --> 00:19:28,599
It's not something out here, right?

163
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,319
Cheese.

164
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:47,819
Oh my god. That emote is fucked up looking.

165
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,180
Can I knock it over?

166
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,559
This thing?

167
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,079
Oh, all right.

168
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,279
This thing's big and heavy.

169
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,400
What about the other ones?

170
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,920
There's a couple more I can do this to probably, right?

171
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,630
There's one more over here.

172
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,920
No. All right.

173
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,720
So what's through here?

174
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:42,680
Can't pick anything up.

175
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,599
Chills. This game is fucking scary.

176
00:20:44,599 --> 00:21:01,619
Is this pretty?

177
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:02,259
This is cool.

178
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:13,690
3 a.m.

179
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,849
That's the Satan hour, isn't it?

180
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:16,730
Satan hour.

181
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,539
Sweet B.

182
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,140
Okay.

183
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,450
Private.

184
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:43,720
It's like, why am I coughing?

185
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,200
All right.

186
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,759
Is this like a Hearthstone game board or does this matter?

187
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,400
Or is it just me going like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom.

188
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,759
And then something happens for a second.

189
00:21:52,759 --> 00:22:10,230
This is a new contract.

190
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:17,460
No need a contract signed and sealed.

191
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,019
What if it happened?

192
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:21,660
You may think it all would be a bad dream.

193
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:37,369
Big can.

194
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:39,690
Some doors are best left closed.

195
00:22:39,690 --> 00:23:05,799
I feel like I won this at the fair and it's a huge pain in the ass to get back to my hotel room.

196
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,599
Oh, yeah, honey.

197
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,880
You won me the big soda.

198
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,400
And like, yeah, can we just donate this?

199
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,079
I don't want this.

200
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,569
How are we going to bring this on the airplane?

201
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:19,109
Well, we're going to want to check this.

202
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:30,019
We need to give this to someone.

203
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:30,339
Whoa.

204
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:30,900
Oh, wait a minute.

205
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:56,490
It's doing the it's doing the Super Mario thing.

206
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,690
Um, all right.

207
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,400
Let's just leave.

208
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,059
Oh, my God.

209
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,940
I don't know if I can play this.

210
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,220
What the fuck?

211
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,859
What is that?

212
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:28,970
What?

213
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,410
Oh, it's an object.

214
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,289
That's weird.

215
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:31,849
All right.

216
00:24:31,849 --> 00:25:02,309
Look, it's an exit.

217
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:15,819
Um, I jump over this.

218
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:16,460
Yeah.

219
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:29,880
Tip that way.

220
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:46,069
Come on.

221
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:46,710
Tip.

222
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:59,160
Oh, my goodness.

223
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,960
That's huge.

224
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,519
Okay.

225
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,319
That's all right.

226
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:23,369
Bingo.

227
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:28,859
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce and I'd like to talk to you about being special.

228
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:33,369
So special, in fact, that we have no idea where you are.

229
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:35,339
But not to worry.

230
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:39,259
We're working on it.

231
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:39,500
Okay.

232
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:39,980
Bye.

233
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:55,019
Does it matter what door I go in?

234
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:55,500
Whoa.

235
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:55,819
Wait.

236
00:26:55,819 --> 00:27:12,220
Hold on.

237
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,619
Whoa.

238
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,119
That was fun.

239
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:14,839
Cool.

240
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,539
What do I do with this?

241
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:38,329
Oh, my God.

242
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:41,109
I made it.

243
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,109
He doesn't think this game is that fun.

244
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:43,349
What?

245
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:43,990
What are you talking about?

246
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,869
How do you know that?

247
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:50,329
I didn't say that.

248
00:27:50,329 --> 00:28:00,779
Why are you saying that?

249
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,019
All right.

250
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:01,819
I'm back to constant.

251
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:03,019
I'm concentrating.

252
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:05,859
This game requires a lot of thought.

253
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,160
No, I can't.

254
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,920
I can't rant about the shitty ice cream that I am.

255
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,240
I can't.

256
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,799
I can't.

257
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,150
No.

258
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:16,630
You want that?

259
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,259
We should have stayed in the other game.

260
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,500
I have to pay attention.

261
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,980
His eyes are glazing over.

262
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,710
I can't.

263
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,589
All right.

264
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:32,220
This doesn't make me like a moron.

265
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,509
Somebody explain it.

266
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:33,750
OK.

267
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,339
Tell me if this makes me a moron.

268
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,970
This music is nice.

269
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,630
I enjoy this, but I could never listen to this.

270
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:46,940
It's too high functioning for me.

271
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,579
It's almost like I don't like it.

272
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,619
It doesn't make me.

273
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:52,660
It's like too much for me.

274
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:02,890
This kind of music is almost like an instrumental telling a story.

275
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:03,369
Right?

276
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:09,720
That's how a lot of jazz and instrument, right?

277
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,619
It's like kind of telling a story without any lyrics.

278
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:17,160
It's just a piano.

279
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,599
Piano kind of tells the story.

280
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:28,900
You guys know what I mean by that, right?

281
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,220
You played the Hatsune Miku game on stream.

282
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:42,630
But there's a huge difference between like bopey, bopey, bopey, bopey, bow.

283
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,869
I can just sit there and like, yay.

284
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,059
And I don't listen to Hatsune Miku.

285
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,759
I don't.

286
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,039
This is wonderful.

287
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:59,049
This is the kind of music that I could just, you know,

288
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,109
have like two fingers of whiskey.

289
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:05,079
Just be like, yeah, yeah, I'm smart like you.

290
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,920
Clink it around.

291
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,849
Just go like this.

292
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:16,250
Two fingers.

293
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,369
Yes, two fingers of whiskey.

294
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:18,089
That's what they call it.

295
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:20,839
Is the amount of fingers tall.

296
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,559
The beverages.

297
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:27,529
Hey, I'll take four fingers of whiskey.

298
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,690
It's like, whoa, dude, settle down.

299
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,640
No, two fingers.

300
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,279
Settle down.

301
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,240
You don't need four.

302
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,250
Hey, I'll take the whole hand.

303
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:52,950
I don't think I've ever heard of ordering four fingers of whiskey.

304
00:30:52,950 --> 00:31:03,079
Anyways, should I leak a stream idea?

305
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,539
I think it might be funny.

306
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:06,140
No, what if I just do it one day?

307
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,980
But who cares?

308
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,619
What if I don't?

309
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:14,839
Do I have to connect this somehow?

310
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,160
What did that do?

311
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,359
Oh, neat.

312
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:30,339
Oh, there we go.

313
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:43,289
What the hell is going on here?

314
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:52,700
Did we forget that?

315
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,980
No, it's not a whiskey stream.

316
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,700
Something else.

317
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,299
God, dude.

318
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:05,450
Good enough.

319
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:11,299
This is way too dank.

320
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:12,019
Should I turn it down?

321
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:34,470
It's all about perspective.

322
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,589
It's all about perspective.

323
00:32:35,589 --> 00:33:29,289
I don't get it.

324
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:31,130
Wait, this is not one of those things here.

325
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:31,690
OK.

326
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,660
Bartender stream?

327
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,059
No.

328
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:42,599
What the hell do I do with this?

329
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,799
Oh, I know what to do.

330
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:55,289
Watch this.

331
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:55,609
Really?

332
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,609
Reception is reality.

333
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:58,089
Yeah.

334
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:19,960
You can hire?

335
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:56,230
Hey, what the fuck?

336
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,610
Jerry.

337
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:07,900
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and I'm just popping in to give you a quick update on where you are.

338
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,730
We still don't know, but please keep moving forward, and hopefully you prefer frequent

339
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,409
updates to being reminded that you are completely lost.

340
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:21,909
Look at that one out.

341
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:22,469
Doc.

342
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:48,219
Bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep.

343
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:53,099
Oh shit.

344
00:35:53,099 --> 00:36:02,019
OK, cool.

345
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:03,219
This is a cool game.

346
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:04,380
I like it.

347
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,260
It's just pretty chill.

348
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,909
It's fun.

349
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,269
It's a interesting mechanic.

350
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,980
I like it.

351
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,849
I like it.

352
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:15,670
All right.

353
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,789
Can I do anything here?

354
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:23,260
I guess not.

355
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,030
Hello.

356
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,389
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and we still can't find you.

357
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,010
But you should now have access to a series of elevators that should trigger your subconscious

358
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,599
to gradually wake you up.

359
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,480
You should also find a variety of emergency exit signs that should lead you to them.

360
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,000
Will all of this work?

361
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,000
Absolutely.

362
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,949
Oh, I did it.

363
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:51,269
I did it.

364
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:56,199
That's what I'm supposed to do.

365
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,320
This game is mid.

366
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,440
When did I say that?

367
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,480
I didn't say that at all.

368
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,239
Give it a seven.

369
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:04,219
Why does everybody think I'm going to give this thing a six?

370
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,070
I'm not going to give it a seven.

371
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,170
I'm not going to give this game a six.

372
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,210
Why is everybody?

373
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,099
Everyone's just like, oh, my God, I can't wait.

374
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,099
He's going to say like, oh, the game sucks.

375
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:14,980
It's like kind of bad.

376
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,659
He's going to give it a 6.5.

377
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,230
Why is everybody waiting for that?

378
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,429
No, it's a fun game.

379
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:24,019
Just grab the moon.

380
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:35,699
What is all over the moon?

381
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,460
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

382
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,590
The event that this elevator does not wake you up.

383
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:46,539
Please don't interact with anything that strikes you as psychologically significant,

384
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:50,139
as we will no longer have any way of controlling it.

385
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:50,860
He's toxic.

386
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,059
He hates everything.

387
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:56,300
If you see your parents, please punch them in the face as hard as you can

388
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
and immediately run away.

389
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,909
Put that back.

390
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:00,949
Put the moon back?

391
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:01,670
I don't think I can.

392
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:15,449
All right.

393
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:16,090
So this is wood.

394
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,079
So how do I get by the wood?

395
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,440
Remember, pay attention.

396
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,880
Perspective is everything.

397
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,059
What is this?

398
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:28,150
Pizza?

399
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,110
Cheese?

400
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,429
All right.

401
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:31,750
Hold on.

402
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,139
I can build.

403
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:34,500
Do I have to climb out of here?

404
00:38:34,500 --> 00:39:01,849
Dude, I have to climb out of here.

405
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:02,730
Oh, no, I don't.

406
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:13,159
Thought I had to climb out.

407
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,119
Don't get lost.

408
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,480
What if there's a fire?

409
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,469
Regular beer fund, five dollars.

410
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:20,550
35 dreams per night.

411
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,090
What if there's a fire in an elevator?

412
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,010
Don't meet sister-in-law.

413
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,059
Don't get lost.

414
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:30,150
Wait, should I take one of the signs?

415
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,630
Ah, fuck it.

416
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,030
Whatever.

417
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:43,429
Why am I so small?

418
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:44,309
Five dollars for beer?

419
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:52,380
Yeah, that seems a little incorrect.

420
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,340
4 a.m. now.

421
00:39:53,340 --> 00:40:06,380
Okay.

422
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,860
So I was really looking to see if there's anything off.

423
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:16,599
Guy, it's sort of gross.

424
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,000
Baking soda?

425
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,800
Green soda?

426
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,239
I probably would like that one.

427
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,619
Red soda, probably.

428
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:24,820
Water soda?

429
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,219
No.

430
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:25,699
No, thanks.

431
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:26,340
It's gross.

432
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,260
It just tastes like just air.

433
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,139
It's a weird burp air.

434
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,699
Okay, do anybody here drink soda water?

435
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:38,380
You're just drinking burp air.

436
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:46,070
Nobody drinks soda water, right?

437
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,679
I don't even like the seltzers.

438
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:54,920
Okay, every time I drink a seltzer, I take a sip.

439
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,679
It's like, ooh, that's kind of nice.

440
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:00,630
And then I get this weird pop rocks kind of at the end.

441
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,539
And it just tastes like fucking gross chemicals.

442
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:05,619
No, none of them ever tasted good to me.

443
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:09,880
It's just, I don't like it.

444
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,630
You know what I wish they would really make?

445
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,829
Have I talked about this yet?

446
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:18,119
What was that?

447
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:26,420
It was a scary noise.

448
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,260
I wish they would make soda that was 60% less sugar.

449
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,539
This is an automated message for all patients

450
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,699
who attempted to use an alternate pathway

451
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,579
to access the next phase of somnasculp therapy,

452
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:39,780
but who have become trapped in a dream state paradox instead.

453
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,139
Your decisions imply a failure of orientation,

454
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:46,980
which reflects negatively on the standard orientation protocol.

455
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,460
What is this?

456
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,619
You will rectify this failure immediately.

457
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,389
No, I don't want diet soda.

458
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,940
I just want less sugar soda.

459
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,980
Diet soda is, oh, there's no sugar in it.

460
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,139
It tastes like fucking chemicals and stuff.

461
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:04,300
And it's got aspartame.

462
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,699
No, no, no, I just want like 15 grams of sugar in my Coke.

463
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:13,539
I don't want to drink zero sugar diet soda.

464
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:14,980
I just want less sugar.

465
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,940
Just put sugar in your diet soda.

466
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,829
No, because it already has that gross weird diet soda sweetener.

467
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:27,900
Just drink water, dude.

468
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,409
Just hold on.

469
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:35,219
That's actually kind of a funny solution, but it's not accurate.

470
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,679
Somebody said just put water in your soda.

471
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,199
So if I buy a 12 ounce,

472
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,460
if I have a 12 ounce can of Coca-Cola and I dilute it by 50% with water,

473
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,380
I mess up all the other ingredients.

474
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,329
That's not going to work.

475
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:54,489
There are flavorings and other stuff in Coke and Pepsi and whatever.

476
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,010
That's not just sugar.

477
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,760
You'd be diluting all the other stuff.

478
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,000
I want the same syrup ratio, but I want 50% less sugar.

479
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,489
Take your own soda on SodaStream.

480
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:09,690
Just drink half your soda.

481
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:14,340
No, it's the same sweetness level.

482
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,380
Add soda water.

483
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,860
No, it would mess it up.

484
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,139
What are you, a chemist?

485
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:28,329
SodaStream might actually be the solution.

486
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:28,570
What?

487
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:28,809
Okay.

488
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:34,099
Is the SodaStream Coca-Cola ripoff a gross Coca-Cola ripoff or does it taste okay?

489
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:48,599
I feel like I know what it tastes like.

490
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:49,320
It's pretty bad.

491
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,280
It's okay.

492
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,260
It's bad.

493
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:51,579
It's bad.

494
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:52,059
It's pretty good.

495
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:52,860
It's okay.

496
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,260
I don't know.

497
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,139
It's okay.

498
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:59,159
All right.

499
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,679
I can't pick up anything here.

500
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:13,320
Just drink Pepsi instead.

501
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:19,340
I don't really like Pepsi.

502
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,860
Pepsi has a weird taste.

503
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,980
It's almost too much.

504
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,699
I don't like it.

505
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,449
I think Coke is way better.

506
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:28,090
Okay.

507
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:36,039
If you took Coke Starlight, if you took fucking Starlight, kid, and you reduced the sugar

508
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:40,329
by like 25%, that would be the best soda I've probably ever made.

509
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:43,579
How do I get that?

510
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:50,889
There's something on the bottom of that.

511
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:58,329
Can I look at the bottom?

512
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:02,630
Starlight is good.

513
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,750
Starlight was very good.

514
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:10,280
Stop making all these other stupid things.

515
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,230
Oh, light.

516
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,670
All right.

517
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,510
Should I go down here?

518
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,210
All right.

519
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:19,690
I'm confused.

520
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:20,809
Let's go down here with the light.

521
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:39,539
All right.

522
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:42,420
It's the chess piece and chess board.

523
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:49,449
Guess I'm going to go this way.

524
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:53,780
Professional tip.

525
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,150
The average adult can only withstand three to five dreams per night.

526
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,269
Once this threshold is eclipsed by entering more dreams,

527
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:04,070
your mind will suffer an explosive mental overload,

528
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,949
reorienting you for the emergency exit protocol.

529
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:07,750
No, I could feel that.

530
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,880
Please subject yourself to explosive mental overload.

531
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,510
No, I could feel that for sure.

532
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,150
Whoa.

533
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,469
All right.

534
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:17,349
This looks weird.

535
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:22,949
Can I pick that up?

536
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:34,389
No, I want that, boy.

537
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:39,320
All right.

538
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:39,880
Yeah.

539
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,000
I don't hate Pepsi.

540
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,280
I just don't prefer it.

541
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:54,619
I used to love Dr. Pepper, but that got a little too much too.

542
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,840
Your tastes change when you get older.

543
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,280
They really do.

544
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Anybody that doesn't agree with that is...

545
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,840
I don't...

546
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,239
I...

547
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:04,500
Okay.

548
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,900
Hold on.

549
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:25,579
I guess that's okay.

550
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:31,269
Okay.

551
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:34,150
Please note that a reluctance to volunteer for the risks

552
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,070
associated with explosive mental overload implies a misunderstanding

553
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,909
of all other solutions, all of which are far more traumatic and likelier.

554
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:43,619
That's kind of loud.

555
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:44,630
You're right.

556
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,230
Nobody said that, but I said it for you.

557
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,900
...to result in catastrophe.

558
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,019
I am not capable of suboptimal suggestions.

559
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:55,340
Please exit this dream as soon as possible.

560
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,099
Whoa.

561
00:47:57,099 --> 00:47:58,460
There's a rubber ducky in here.

562
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:05,110
What can I do with this?

563
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:35,880
All right.

564
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,360
That's fine.

565
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,059
Yeah.

566
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:40,019
Starlight was the best.

567
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:42,570
God damn it.

568
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:42,969
Okay.

569
00:48:42,969 --> 00:48:43,449
Well, whatever.

570
00:48:43,449 --> 00:49:01,429
Just...

571
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:05,699
Hey, if it works, you need to worry about it.

572
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:06,420
Anything else?

573
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,440
Whoa.

574
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,219
Jesus.

575
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:13,619
Okay.

576
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,219
Well, how many of these do I need?

577
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:20,630
A few?

578
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:48,309
Are they good enough?

579
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:48,630
Yeah.

580
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:11,179
Did I do it wrong?

581
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:15,219
I don't think so.

582
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:16,099
I don't think I did it right.

583
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:23,500
Oh, moka ee.

584
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:29,139
casino.

585
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:36,170
If you love Hatsune Miku, wish her a happy birthday, then.

586
00:50:53,050 --> 00:51:00,300
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

587
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,019
And despite touring the Waterfall Serenity Zone

588
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:05,500
in the previous section you've just completed,

589
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,940
you may still be experiencing feelings of worthlessness

590
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,139
and self-doubt.

591
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:11,179
Happy birthday, Miku!

592
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:12,780
So I feel like everything is going...

593
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,659
From me, Jeremy.

594
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:31,670
...even when the sun is shining.

595
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:42,199
Seven days late, by the way.

596
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,719
Within seven days is fine.

597
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:47,099
I don't think that's a problem.

598
00:51:47,820 --> 00:52:03,269
I'm just waiting for the Cleric Beast sound

599
00:52:03,269 --> 00:52:39,940
that they use in all the Souls games.

600
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,900
Meat freezer?

601
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:47,900
A lot of Bloodborne references today.

602
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,489
Yeah, I'm a very simple person.

603
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:56,630
Whatever I'm referencing the most on a given day,

604
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,630
you better bet your ass that that's the thing

605
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,630
that I've been consuming for the last week or two.

606
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,159
So if for some reason you start getting

607
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:04,920
a bunch of Breaking Bad references,

608
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,920
I'm currently watching Breaking Bad.

609
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,940
It's just everything lives up here for about two weeks

610
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,610
and then goes away forever.

611
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,889
Yeah, like Eren, I was watching Attack on Titan.

612
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:19,449
Yeah.

613
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,769
I think it was at one point when I was talking about

614
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:25,219
having quirks from My Hero Academia.

615
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:26,260
And I watched like...

616
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,739
I think I watched like six episodes of that whole show.

617
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:38,139
And I was just like, ah, never mind.

618
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:40,570
You should watch more. It's good.

619
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:41,690
That's six too many.

620
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:42,250
I...

621
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:42,809
This Blood...

622
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:43,289
Wait, hold on.

623
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:46,170
This Blood on the Ground in this fucking PG Disney game.

624
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,739
It's just this...

625
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:48,940
Wait, the Disney didn't make this,

626
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,860
but you know what I mean?

627
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,820
Wait, what the hell is going...

628
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:58,420
This is a scary game, is it?

629
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,539
Is this a scary game?

630
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:00,500
What the fuck happened?

631
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,159
I thought this was a fun puzzle game.

632
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:09,500
Is this a scary game?

633
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Okay, I was not ready for a scary game tonight,

634
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,300
but whatever.

635
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:24,789
Why is it Blood Murder?

636
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:37,800
I want to play a game where I just have a big wrench

637
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,579
as a melee weapon and that's it.

638
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,420
And you get like two attacks.

639
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,860
Just like wild swing, wild overhead swing.

640
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:49,269
Don't you think it'd be so fun with scary monsters and stuff?

641
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:50,150
That's Half-Life 2.

642
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,949
No, no, no, no, no, no.

643
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:55,610
I already played Condemned.

644
00:54:55,610 --> 00:55:01,260
Yeah, I kind of want another Condemned

645
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,139
where I just have a wrench or a pipe in my hand and that's it.

646
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:09,030
So what do I do here?

647
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:21,289
Cry of Fear.

648
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:22,409
I played Cry of Fear.

649
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:23,980
Posing Force.

650
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,340
I feel like I played that too.

651
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,070
Okay, I obviously don't know what's going on.

652
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:43,420
So one of the lights up here, the door handles, the lights.

653
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,539
I can't pick anything up.

654
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:58,760
I don't get it.

655
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:58,730
You should play Bioshock.

656
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:22,679
I die, die, die.

657
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:24,980
Almost got me.

658
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,940
Almost.

659
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,900
Nice try though.

660
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:39,269
I applaud your effort.

661
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:39,769
Whoops.

662
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:41,349
It's scripted.

663
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:42,389
It's scripted, it's scripted.

664
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:49,429
All right, should I just do the Fall Guys strategy?

665
00:57:49,429 --> 00:58:21,960
All right, what's going on?

666
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,519
Tell me.

667
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:27,219
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce and I'd like to know more

668
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:31,670
about the feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt mentioned before.

669
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:36,309
You feel this way because you want the kind of happy life you see all around you.

670
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,530
Kind you know everyone else is enjoying.

671
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,820
And that's exactly why we're here to help.

672
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:53,780
It's all about perspective.

673
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:59,909
This is why I don't have a coat rack in my house.

674
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:06,679
I don't have any furniture that looks like a person in the dark.

675
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:11,139
It's just bed, barrows, nothing else.

676
00:59:11,139 --> 00:59:14,809
I don't want to turn over in half asleep and look at the coat rack

677
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:17,289
and think that someone's going to literally hit me with a fucking hammer in the head.

678
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:18,010
You know what I mean?

679
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:18,730
That's not going to happen.

680
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:37,139
I'm sorry.

681
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:38,179
Shut up and play the game.

682
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:38,739
I am.

683
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:39,699
What are you talking about?

684
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:45,289
Play the game.

685
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,250
Don't play the game.

686
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:46,889
Next game.

687
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:47,369
New game.

688
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:48,010
Old game.

689
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:53,139
Got fucking Goldilocks Andes here today.

690
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,829
Oh, right here.

691
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:19,340
You were advised to subject yourself to explosive mental overload

692
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:24,539
by descending into additional dreams but have now descended into a dream within a dream instead,

693
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:27,019
disorienting yourself even further.

694
01:00:27,019 --> 01:00:30,380
You are responsible for failing to make this crucial distinction.

695
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:37,619
That counts, right?

696
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,070
That doesn't count.

697
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:51,000
Dude, if you ever find yourself a dream within a dream and you're very aware of it,

698
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,190
think of an insane invention.

699
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,949
Think of something that is just crazy.

700
01:00:56,949 --> 01:01:01,059
Think of an awesome story or an amazing invention.

701
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:05,619
Your mind, your subconscious mind will create such unbelievable shit.

702
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:08,469
And then when you get up, fucking write it down because it might be revolutionary.

703
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:11,769
How many times you've been in a dream and you've actually thought of,

704
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:15,130
holy shit, this is an incredible invention that I just came up with.

705
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,809
Oh, this is an awesome movie.

706
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:17,610
That would be amazing.

707
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:20,550
This is a great video game.

708
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,869
Our subconscious minds come up with some of the craziest shit.

709
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,659
I never write them down.

710
01:01:25,659 --> 01:01:26,139
Write them down.

711
01:01:35,269 --> 01:01:35,909
Can I?

712
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:36,710
No.

713
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,550
I thought this worked on the exits.

714
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,780
Like, it's going to change the...

715
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,730
Oh, wait, that wasn't an exit.

716
01:01:46,730 --> 01:02:23,190
Wait, what's down here?

717
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,030
Yeah, if you're talking to somebody in your dream, go,

718
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:28,780
hey, what's the best thing that you could come up with invention-wise?

719
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:29,880
What is it?

720
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,000
The person will be like, oh, well, I mean, we've got to have a new type of

721
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,039
plastic material that could be a rope.

722
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:37,480
Listen to that person.

723
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,789
They're going to tell you something insane.

724
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:42,550
You will come up with a new chemical

725
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,190
because the person in your brain you're talking to will tell you.

726
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:57,980
I need to get that over here.

727
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:08,920
Does that work or should I move it?

728
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,340
No, that doesn't work.

729
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:16,500
All right, get it away.

730
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:30,949
Can I grab it through here?

731
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:34,260
No.

732
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,619
Wait, is there an opening here?

733
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:43,340
Does that work?

734
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:43,900
I'm confused.

735
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,619
I don't know if it worked.

736
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:57,130
That did not work.

737
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,269
Hold on.

738
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:17,079
Can I go the other way?

739
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:18,119
Oh, shit, did I blow it?

740
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,199
Did I blow it?

741
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:34,599
Oh, no, I blew it.

742
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:39,429
Wait, what's happening?

743
01:04:39,429 --> 01:04:41,139
Give me that.

744
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:48,940
I don't have two.

745
01:04:48,940 --> 01:05:10,230
I need light.

746
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,030
Make this bright.

747
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:12,570
Light this whole room up.

748
01:05:12,650 --> 01:06:34,630
These aren't open, though.

749
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,349
I don't get it.

750
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:52,599
Can I light it up or something?

751
01:06:52,599 --> 01:07:10,760
I don't understand where to go.

752
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,260
Oh.

753
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:27,179
Did you know that unintentional multi-dream layering occurs in less than 1% of patients?

754
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:30,539
This correlates strongly with the 99% of patients

755
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:35,179
who are able to follow simple instructions from the standard orientation protocol.

756
01:07:35,179 --> 01:07:35,679
Where's the knife?

757
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:40,070
And there's a knife right here.

758
01:07:45,289 --> 01:07:58,889
What?

759
01:07:58,889 --> 01:08:22,869
IKEA?

760
01:08:22,869 --> 01:08:27,050
Oh, it was red paint.

761
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:29,130
It was red paint all along.

762
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,170
And that's the-

763
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,829
Look at that.

764
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:32,630
Interesting.

765
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,949
Okay, can I pick anything up?

766
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:36,149
It was just a joke.

767
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:43,029
I can grab the cans.

768
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm getting out of here.

769
01:08:47,000 --> 01:09:19,340
I'm going out the window.

770
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:36,699
Hey, I'm almost there.

771
01:09:36,699 --> 01:09:38,300
What the fuck are you doing?

772
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:55,930
Did I lose it forever?

773
01:09:55,930 --> 01:10:25,079
No, no, I can get this.

774
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:25,720
Never mind.

775
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:34,310
What does it say?

776
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:38,470
Something.

777
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:39,750
At least he's handsome.

778
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:59,430
I appreciate that.

779
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:00,630
This is my good side, yeah.

780
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:01,989
I know some people say that.

781
01:11:01,989 --> 01:11:20,630
Turn it off.

782
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:35,079
Thumbnail photo.

783
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:37,300
You know, I thought a long time ago

784
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:41,109
it would be kind of funny.

785
01:11:41,109 --> 01:11:47,909
10 years ago, I took 20 to 30 thumbnail photos

786
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:49,750
and never stopped using them.

787
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:53,899
And I used them still everywhere for everything.

788
01:11:53,899 --> 01:11:56,380
10 plus years later, I look-

789
01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:00,170
Wait, it's like, man, you look really young in those thumbnails.

790
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:09,079
Take enough of them where they could have any context.

791
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:11,590
Take some really specific ones

792
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:16,869
that could only exist in Elden Ring, for instance.

793
01:12:16,869 --> 01:12:18,550
Like, look, I'm wearing a-

794
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,949
Oh, I'm wearing a crown or something.

795
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:23,300
Or something very specific

796
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,600
that could be used for Elden Ring.

797
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,760
And I took all these 10 years ago.

798
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:37,750
Like me with a Mario mustache on and a Mario costume

799
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,270
and I play Mario and it's like, dude,

800
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,270
you were fucking 25 when you took these pictures.

801
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:45,659
Take some different ones.

802
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,020
Only Elden Ring has crowns.

803
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:47,899
I know, but you know what I mean, though?

804
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:51,430
Just take like 300 photos.

805
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,060
Incredibly specific shit.

806
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,020
At least 200 of them would be very specific.

807
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,979
Like me holding a Rubik's Cube, right?

808
01:12:59,979 --> 01:13:00,779
Just in case.

809
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:06,470
Just do it now.

810
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:07,189
It's too late now.

811
01:13:07,909 --> 01:13:08,630
I can't do it.

812
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:22,810
One of you other comedians can do it.

813
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:30,359
But I want credit and I want 5% of all your royalties.

814
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:32,279
When you're 60 and you're streaming,

815
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:37,130
you're going to want to do this.

816
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:46,739
I'm clearly in my 50s.

817
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:48,020
Do it for 10 years from now.

818
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:48,819
I don't think I'm going to look down

819
01:13:48,819 --> 01:13:50,340
on just different 10 years from now.

820
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,670
Will I?

821
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:52,229
Probably.

822
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:53,350
That's a weird thought.

823
01:13:53,350 --> 01:14:04,739
I don't want to know the answer to that question.

824
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:09,399
All right, something to do with unlocking it, right?

825
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:12,819
Perspective or something.

826
01:14:12,819 --> 01:14:15,239
Look at it from an angle.

827
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:16,680
Hold on, can I take anything from here?

828
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:32,539
Are you going to be Benjamin Button?

829
01:14:32,539 --> 01:14:48,380
What a fucking weird movie, by the way.

830
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,020
Great.

831
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,920
Now I know what we're doing for the next hour.

832
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:15,609
I know for a fact at least one person closed the stream

833
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:17,369
because they went, it's time for bed.

834
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:19,270
I don't really want to see this shit.

835
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:22,550
Somebody just went, oh, he's going to do this.

836
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:23,670
It's like, oh, it's kind of funny.

837
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:26,729
But close the iPad, you know, whatever.

838
01:15:26,729 --> 01:15:27,529
Put it down.

839
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:28,970
Like that sound.

840
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:39,020
And then they put it over and go to bed.

841
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,220
Oh, that's it.

842
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,500
Oh, that's it.

843
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:49,640
All right, we're good.

844
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,000
I fucking ruined it.

845
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,359
I hate that I ruined it.

846
01:15:52,359 --> 01:16:26,699
You've ruined everything.

847
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:27,340
Attention.

848
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,380
Dr. Pierce requires you to note the following risks

849
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,300
of dream over exposure.

850
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,979
Significant memory loss, both quantitative and qualitative.

851
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:39,100
Hallucinations of dreaded or annoying objects.

852
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,140
Unrealistic beliefs about the lengths of hallways

853
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:45,020
and other side effects which have not yet been discovered

854
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:46,619
or which cannot be understood.

855
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:47,260
I don't want to hear it.

856
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,140
I actually don't want to.

857
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:49,340
How do I turn this off?

858
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,460
I actually don't want to hear this.

859
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:53,300
I actually don't want to hear this sound.

860
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:29,140
OK.

861
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,140
Silent stream.

862
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,260
I don't want to put.

863
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:46,039
My cursor is different.

864
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:56,020
It was a smiley.

865
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:56,500
Now it's not.

866
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,220
That's weird.

867
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:00,199
Right click to return.

868
01:18:00,199 --> 01:18:00,439
All right.

869
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:10,310
So I got a bunch of apples and holy shit.

870
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,789
That's big.

871
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:11,189
All right.

872
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:12,710
Um, take it off.

873
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:13,770
How do I get it?

874
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:14,810
Oh, I have to roll it.

875
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:27,510
Come on, get it off.

876
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:56,890
This reminds me of the Beatles movie.

877
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:58,890
Um, I can't pick these up.

878
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:06,869
I can't pick these up.

879
01:19:06,869 --> 01:19:47,510
Am I doing this right?

880
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,869
Uh, I don't think.

881
01:19:48,869 --> 01:19:49,510
I don't know.

882
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:53,770
This is where I stopped playing.

883
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:57,270
Really?

884
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:46,100
Uh, I can see why.

885
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,300
Shouldn't have quit, man.

886
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:59,859
Where's the exit?

887
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:08,779
It's right by me.

888
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:19,689
Dr. Pierce is frantically submitting numerous spelling

889
01:21:19,689 --> 01:21:22,329
and grammar mistakes into the standard orientation.

890
01:21:22,329 --> 01:21:22,810
Wow.

891
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:32,649
You're so much better than them.

892
01:21:32,649 --> 01:21:34,890
You will not receive these messages.

893
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,729
They would not make sense regardless.

894
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,649
Saw that one from a mile away.

895
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:47,130
Did I have a play condemned too?

896
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:55,319
I did.

897
01:21:55,319 --> 01:21:56,279
Did I beat it?

898
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:01,939
That was one.

899
01:22:01,939 --> 01:22:02,979
Oh, no, I did.

900
01:22:02,979 --> 01:22:03,539
Yeah.

901
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:14,149
Have I played every video game?

902
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:18,060
Significant error will interpret his basic ideas.

903
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:18,779
Hello.

904
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:20,619
My introductions are redundant.

905
01:22:20,619 --> 01:22:23,539
A real doctor who went to doctor school.

906
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:25,779
VR has never been a mistake.

907
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:28,260
I can help you, but I also do not know how.

908
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,060
I thought I had to pick that up.

909
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,100
Transmission ends.

910
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,779
Hello.

911
01:22:36,779 --> 01:22:39,020
Name is my Pierce, Dr. Glenn.

912
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,899
To the Somnusculpt welcome experience.

913
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:43,100
You haven't played Cave Story?

914
01:22:44,779 --> 01:22:45,500
Little do you know.

915
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,979
I did on YouTube.

916
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:49,180
Professional invention.

917
01:22:49,979 --> 01:22:51,659
Age science with cutting.

918
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:53,500
A tomorrow can brighten.

919
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,260
I'm actually, seriously.

920
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:01,659
How many of you guys were here for the,

921
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:03,579
those old YouTube streams?

922
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:11,590
Wait, what?

923
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:12,789
Is there even anybody here?

924
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,939
I wonder just how many people stuck around for that long.

925
01:23:19,939 --> 01:23:23,289
What about the suffering?

926
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,409
I played the suffering one.

927
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,270
I don't think I beat it though.

928
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,510
All right.

929
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:28,869
That's a relaxation room.

930
01:23:28,869 --> 01:23:29,829
That's bait.

931
01:23:29,829 --> 01:23:32,140
We're going to go into the scream room.

932
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:58,649
That's pretty nice.

933
01:23:58,649 --> 01:24:04,710
Started watching you on YouTube, but not the YouTube streams.

934
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:13,939
Hello.

935
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:15,859
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

936
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,460
This is a notification that you have reappeared.

937
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,739
Was Cave Story on Twitch?

938
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:21,380
Was it?

939
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:22,340
I thought it was on YouTube.

940
01:24:22,819 --> 01:24:26,229
Please continue to do whatever you did most recently.

941
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:30,779
And discontinue whatever you were doing immediately prior to that.

942
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:36,359
The beginning of the game?

943
01:24:36,359 --> 01:25:10,100
Wait, I need to, I need to stand on something.

944
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:14,220
What can I bring with me?

945
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:14,779
Chair?

946
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:24,550
Podium?

947
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:25,750
Dollhouse 2.

948
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:29,300
Should I make it smaller?

949
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:34,710
That's way bigger.

950
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:40,260
Hold on.

951
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,819
Oh shit.

952
01:25:40,819 --> 01:25:41,939
It is what you do.

953
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:42,579
All right.

954
01:25:42,579 --> 01:25:48,010
Can I get out?

955
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:56,920
Oh, I can't get out.

956
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:57,239
Shit.

957
01:25:57,239 --> 01:26:11,479
It's, I got to make it, it should be perfect.

958
01:26:11,479 --> 01:26:35,369
Um, how does this work?

959
01:26:35,369 --> 01:26:45,260
God damn it.

960
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:52,920
I think that's correct.

961
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:53,319
Yeah.

962
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:57,779
This game is cute.

963
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:21,800
Hello again, Peter.

964
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,300
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

965
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:28,619
In addition to continuing and discontinuing as mentioned earlier,

966
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:33,739
please also disregard any unsettling experiences that you may have recently had.

967
01:27:34,539 --> 01:27:39,020
Everything should have now reverted to being soothing and therapeutic.

968
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:43,739
If this is not the case, you may be receiving this message in error.

969
01:27:44,539 --> 01:27:47,930
Cute means you hate it.

970
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:49,289
No.

971
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:50,649
Cute means exactly what I said.

972
01:27:50,649 --> 01:27:51,609
It's cute.

973
01:27:51,609 --> 01:27:52,250
It's a cute game.

974
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:52,489
It's fun.

975
01:27:52,489 --> 01:27:54,329
I'm very engaged.

976
01:27:54,329 --> 01:27:56,489
There hasn't been any slow parts in this.

977
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:58,649
It's been just content, content, content, content, content.

978
01:27:58,649 --> 01:27:59,210
No stopping.

979
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:00,170
No slow down.

980
01:28:01,029 --> 01:28:03,369
The puzzles aren't obnoxious.

981
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:04,649
They're fun.

982
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:05,609
They're interesting.

983
01:28:05,609 --> 01:28:06,090
Content.

984
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:19,050
Holy shit.

985
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:19,289
Okay.

986
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:25,899
Can I jump into this?

987
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:36,890
Try harder.

988
01:28:37,989 --> 01:28:39,109
I think I'm doing fine.

989
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:04,500
Oh, no, stop.

990
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:14,359
It'll be huge.

991
01:29:14,359 --> 01:29:16,199
You're doing suspiciously good.

992
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:19,800
What, like, you mean I watched a let's play of this yesterday in anticipation?

993
01:29:20,569 --> 01:29:23,260
Words have been tough today, I'll be honest.

994
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,060
I don't know why.

995
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:29,800
If a word has, I'm telling you, go back and watch this VOD.

996
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,939
If a word has had more than four syllables, I've got it wrong.

997
01:29:33,939 --> 01:29:39,609
Anticipation, right?

998
01:29:39,609 --> 01:29:40,970
You know, soliloquy.

999
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:42,569
I said that wrong earlier, didn't I?

1000
01:29:42,569 --> 01:30:00,220
You're reading too many mean comments.

1001
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:00,539
Am I?

1002
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:01,180
No, I'm not.

1003
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:02,500
None of them mean.

1004
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,619
Who said a mean comment?

1005
01:30:03,619 --> 01:30:07,060
I don't remember a mean comment.

1006
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:08,420
I don't think anyone's been mean.

1007
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:10,260
People have just been messing around.

1008
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:10,819
It's fine.

1009
01:30:10,819 --> 01:30:15,590
No, I don't think anyone's been mean.

1010
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:17,000
People are just having fun.

1011
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,750
It's all right.

1012
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:25,220
My name is Dr. Favorite Inspirational Quote.

1013
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:30,409
Worst thing you can do is focus on negativity.

1014
01:30:30,409 --> 01:30:34,899
Won't spare you from the cage of death, the pain of disease,

1015
01:30:34,899 --> 01:30:38,819
the cruelty of time, the cold shell of human nature,

1016
01:30:38,819 --> 01:30:42,180
or the eventual loss of everything you've ever held dear.

1017
01:30:42,819 --> 01:30:45,539
Whatever you do, don't focus on that.

1018
01:30:50,819 --> 01:30:53,060
OK, I'm going to listen to the narrator.

1019
01:30:53,060 --> 01:31:01,430
All right.

1020
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:02,149
Oh, yeah.

1021
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:10,140
Is it going to be fun?

1022
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,100
No, it's too big.

1023
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:11,819
There we go.

1024
01:31:11,819 --> 01:31:19,819
Too much.

1025
01:31:19,819 --> 01:31:24,149
God damn it.

1026
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:24,649
Shit.

1027
01:31:47,909 --> 01:31:48,550
Did I make it?

1028
01:31:48,550 --> 01:32:28,100
What am I looking at here?

1029
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:28,739
I don't get it.

1030
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:33,449
I've got to get up there.

1031
01:32:33,449 --> 01:32:37,529
I don't get it.

1032
01:32:37,529 --> 01:32:38,250
I ruined it.

1033
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:38,810
How do I do that?

1034
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:43,850
I don't get it.

1035
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:44,409
I get it.

1036
01:32:44,409 --> 01:32:57,529
I get it.

1037
01:32:57,529 --> 01:33:06,680
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and I'd like to thank you

1038
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:12,359
for triggering every single one of our 823 emergency protocols.

1039
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:16,680
This will assist us greatly in improving the system for future patients.

1040
01:33:17,239 --> 01:33:18,359
Congratulations.

1041
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:22,119
Anyway, you're now headed in the right direction,

1042
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:25,960
and we should be able to initiate the emergency exit protocol shortly.

1043
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:44,329
The dark portal.

1044
01:33:44,329 --> 01:33:45,210
Oh, shit.

1045
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:46,569
I'm going into the nether.

1046
01:33:46,569 --> 01:33:50,260
Come on, give me all you Minecraft fans.

1047
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:50,739
Come on.

1048
01:33:50,739 --> 01:33:58,539
Wait, am I too big?

1049
01:33:58,539 --> 01:34:00,859
Oh, my goodness.

1050
01:34:00,859 --> 01:34:02,939
I'm so OK.

1051
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:03,579
I need to be.

1052
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:10,680
I don't get it.

1053
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,970
I wait.

1054
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:17,270
I kind of get it a little.

1055
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:20,140
I kind of understand this.

1056
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:21,260
I get it a little bit.

1057
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:24,949
OK, I get it.

1058
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:28,859
OK, I get it.

1059
01:34:28,859 --> 01:34:30,859
All right, I get it.

1060
01:34:30,859 --> 01:34:32,810
I just have to go through that.

1061
01:34:35,029 --> 01:34:40,760
Wait, I think I'm too big to even go in this.

1062
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,989
I'm too big.

1063
01:34:45,989 --> 01:34:46,390
I can't.

1064
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,109
I broke it.

1065
01:34:47,109 --> 01:34:48,069
I can't do it.

1066
01:34:48,069 --> 01:34:51,239
I think I'm actually too big.

1067
01:34:51,319 --> 01:35:06,760
I don't think I can make this big enough.

1068
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:07,319
Maybe.

1069
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:08,039
Hold on.

1070
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:08,600
Yeah, I can.

1071
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:08,840
All right.

1072
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:27,220
Wait, wait, wait.

1073
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:28,739
Don't fall.

1074
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:30,100
Stop falling.

1075
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:33,189
Stop falling.

1076
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:34,149
Stop falling.

1077
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:47,699
That works.

1078
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:48,180
Get in there.

1079
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:48,979
Can I crouch?

1080
01:35:48,979 --> 01:35:58,039
Stupid.

1081
01:35:58,039 --> 01:35:58,840
Come on.

1082
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,720
Get out of the way.

1083
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:45,029
I made it.

1084
01:36:45,029 --> 01:36:46,869
I am very small.

1085
01:36:46,869 --> 01:36:49,029
I am incredibly small.

1086
01:36:49,829 --> 01:36:50,550
I need to fix this.

1087
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:51,109
Hold on.

1088
01:36:51,109 --> 01:37:13,579
I can't get even smaller.

1089
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:14,140
Can I?

1090
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:17,739
No, I've got to be at least normal size here.

1091
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:24,920
Is that better?

1092
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,340
No, I got to be huge for this.

1093
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:39,159
Hold on.

1094
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:41,399
Can I not do that?

1095
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:42,039
Okay.

1096
01:37:42,039 --> 01:38:09,079
I think I don't.

1097
01:38:09,079 --> 01:38:34,420
Oh, how am I doing on time for the game?

1098
01:38:35,239 --> 01:38:36,199
Am I almost at the end?

1099
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:37,000
Am I halfway?

1100
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:38,359
30%?

1101
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:39,850
Two thirds?

1102
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:40,329
What do you think?

1103
01:38:40,329 --> 01:38:41,130
Oh, how tall?

1104
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,090
Not how tall am I.

1105
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:42,970
How far am I?

1106
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:53,739
You're pretty close.

1107
01:38:53,739 --> 01:38:54,300
Okay, cool.

1108
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:55,800
Just curious.

1109
01:39:26,659 --> 01:39:27,300
Analysis.

1110
01:39:31,109 --> 01:39:31,750
Uh-oh.

1111
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:33,189
Blood except it's paint.

1112
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,060
This is lore.

1113
01:39:55,029 --> 01:39:55,750
Some lore here.

1114
01:39:56,710 --> 01:39:59,029
1991, 1992.

1115
01:39:59,029 --> 01:40:00,310
This takes place in the 90s.

1116
01:40:00,949 --> 01:40:04,340
Okay, cool.

1117
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,460
Reformulating.

1118
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,100
Improved hypothesis.

1119
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:30,380
Patient requires additional Somnascope therapy.

1120
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:31,340
Conclusion.

1121
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:33,340
Emergency exit protocol cannot proceed.

1122
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:34,380
Wake up.

1123
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:37,659
Emergency exit protocol has been emergency destroyed.

1124
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:42,090
Instruction.

1125
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:46,170
Continue with Somnascope therapy indefinitely on an independent basis

1126
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:48,970
as all orientation resources have been exhausted.

1127
01:40:49,609 --> 01:40:52,890
This concludes your standard orientation protocol.

1128
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:53,390
Goodbye.

1129
01:40:54,090 --> 01:41:04,020
I don't have a TV in this hotel.

1130
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:17,739
Okay.

1131
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:19,479
Wake up.

1132
01:41:19,479 --> 01:41:20,760
Where's the continental breakfast?

1133
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:22,760
Yeah, where's the orange juice machine?

1134
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:28,500
There's a trick.

1135
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:34,659
Do you want to check out this little indie game?

1136
01:41:34,659 --> 01:41:36,579
It's called Disney Infinity 3.0.

1137
01:41:36,579 --> 01:41:51,449
I would sooner show my asshole on stream than play Disney Infinity 3.0.

1138
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:56,680
If I think of like where that sits, you know what I mean?

1139
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:03,670
Like if I'm just being, I'm just telling you that's where that sits.

1140
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:04,310
What the fuck?

1141
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:05,829
Why am I on the ground?

1142
01:42:05,829 --> 01:42:08,489
What is happening?

1143
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:22,390
Um, is this supposed to be happening?

1144
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:34,899
This doesn't feel right.

1145
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:35,619
Wait.

1146
01:42:35,619 --> 01:42:36,579
Whoa.

1147
01:42:36,579 --> 01:42:37,380
Okay.

1148
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:37,859
All right.

1149
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:38,579
All right.

1150
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:41,979
That just freaked me out so bad.

1151
01:42:41,979 --> 01:42:43,579
I was on the ground.

1152
01:42:43,579 --> 01:42:46,250
I, what?

1153
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:46,649
Okay.

1154
01:42:46,649 --> 01:42:49,130
That was, that was weird.

1155
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:57,989
I thought it was sucking me around and pulling me backwards.

1156
01:42:57,989 --> 01:43:00,149
But no, there's, I, there's nothing, I have nothing wrong.

1157
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:04,100
Nothing bad to say about Disney Infinity 3.0.

1158
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:07,380
There's just not a single chance I would ever play that.

1159
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:08,699
Ever.

1160
01:43:08,699 --> 01:43:10,229
Under any circumstance.

1161
01:43:10,229 --> 01:43:12,199
Any circumstance.

1162
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:13,720
It's just something I would never do.

1163
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,520
Ever.

1164
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,819
I also would never show my asshole on stream.

1165
01:43:19,699 --> 01:43:21,460
I'm making this up like if I had a choice.

1166
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:37,180
You have to choose.

1167
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:37,739
Okay.

1168
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:43,819
Is the, is the show asshole stream 10 seconds long?

1169
01:43:43,819 --> 01:43:49,819
Is it 10 seconds of show asshole versus how many hours of Disney Infinity 3.0?

1170
01:43:49,819 --> 01:43:50,060
Okay.

1171
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,119
So it's 10 seconds.

1172
01:43:52,119 --> 01:43:53,880
How long is the Disney Infinity stream?

1173
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:55,619
10 hours?

1174
01:43:55,619 --> 01:44:01,590
I would, I'd show my asshole.

1175
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:09,880
I would, I would, I just know I don't want to play Disney Infinity for 10 hours.

1176
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:12,140
You just get banned.

1177
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:13,260
It was pretty good run.

1178
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:14,380
I think it was pretty good run.

1179
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:20,970
I'm not playing Disney Infinity for 10 hours.

1180
01:44:20,970 --> 01:44:30,260
Because that means two, uh, okay, maybe I would still do it.

1181
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:36,899
If you said 15 hours, that crosses the threshold of that's three streams.

1182
01:44:36,899 --> 01:44:39,300
I'm not playing Disney Infinity 3.0 for three streams.

1183
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:40,420
What if it's awesome though?

1184
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:41,779
What if it's a great game?

1185
01:44:41,779 --> 01:44:50,069
What if I loved it?

1186
01:44:50,069 --> 01:44:50,630
Okay.

1187
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:58,100
Maybe I make that bigger and jump into it in Mario style.

1188
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:58,899
Yeah, definitely.

1189
01:44:58,899 --> 01:45:20,439
I found the first one okay.

1190
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:21,159
All right, hold on.

1191
01:45:21,159 --> 01:45:26,600
Is it one of those games where you select three or four licensed characters

1192
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:38,300
and they auto battle turn-based RPG style with people in the villains from the universe?

1193
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:41,159
No, wait.

1194
01:45:41,159 --> 01:45:41,720
So hold on.

1195
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:50,859
It's not I choose Buzz Lightyear, uh, Woody and, uh, the dog from Lady and the Tramp.

1196
01:45:50,859 --> 01:45:51,579
It's not that.

1197
01:45:51,579 --> 01:45:56,460
It's not like a battle RPG kind of.

1198
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,539
Wait, so it's Skylanders.

1199
01:45:58,539 --> 01:46:01,689
Oh, oh, I had the game wrong.

1200
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:02,979
I'd play it.

1201
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:22,060
Yeah, it's like a Disney Skylanders.

1202
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:23,340
One of those toys to life games.

1203
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,260
The figures have a chip in them like an amiibo.

1204
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:43,399
Dude, come on.

1205
01:46:43,399 --> 01:46:47,670
What?

1206
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:50,699
Oh, oh, you're going to make me puke with this one.

1207
01:46:50,699 --> 01:47:11,670
Are you actually going to make me actually throw up this one?

1208
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:33,930
Uh, uh, this is infinity.

1209
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:40,600
Okay, but can I put a can I put a stipulation on the on the asshole stream?

1210
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:46,970
Could that be, uh, all right, Disney infinity for 15 hours or I show my asshole,

1211
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:50,170
but I need I need a half a million dollars in donations.

1212
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:07,880
Can you imagine the fucking articles?

1213
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:19,819
I'm just imagining a scenario where it's like, oh, yeah, we're almost there.

1214
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,460
Four hundred and eighty thousand dollars.

1215
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,899
Wow, I can't believe it.

1216
01:48:23,899 --> 01:48:24,300
Almost.

1217
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:25,579
Oh, we took we did it.

1218
01:48:25,579 --> 01:48:27,420
Five hundred five hundred.

1219
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,060
I can't help.

1220
01:48:28,939 --> 01:48:34,409
Five hundred thousand and I turn and would the stream go off, right?

1221
01:48:34,409 --> 01:48:36,869
Somebody would be there waiting.

1222
01:48:36,869 --> 01:48:41,739
If I had a half a million dollar donation goal, the stream would turn off immediately

1223
01:48:41,739 --> 01:48:43,579
when I turned around.

1224
01:48:43,579 --> 01:48:52,550
It would just do the disconnect thing and then it would be like this channel no longer exists.

1225
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:54,859
There is no other incentive.

1226
01:48:54,859 --> 01:48:58,300
There's not like, oh, at ten thousand, I'm going to do this at fifty thousand.

1227
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:03,989
No, it's just this one goal.

1228
01:49:03,989 --> 01:49:07,210
That's it.

1229
01:49:07,210 --> 01:49:10,649
Oh, my God, dude, what is going on?

1230
01:49:10,649 --> 01:49:16,520
That's the retirement stream.

1231
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:23,699
No, I mean, that's that's an absurd thought thing we're doing where we're just thinking

1232
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:27,720
about holy shit.

1233
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:35,050
It's like Metal Gear Solid Boss music.

1234
01:49:35,050 --> 01:49:35,770
I got to get out of here.

1235
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,260
Reception is not reality.

1236
01:50:27,260 --> 01:51:10,199
Oh, fuck off.

1237
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:10,760
That's it.

1238
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:11,479
No, it's not.

1239
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:13,270
Go back through backwards.

1240
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:17,060
There it is.

1241
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:18,739
OK, backwards again.

1242
01:51:18,739 --> 01:51:35,300
Can I turn this green or something?

1243
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:35,619
Stop.

1244
01:51:35,619 --> 01:52:14,460
Dead end.

1245
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:15,100
Shit.

1246
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:23,539
Wait, you don't get it wrong and then walk this way?

1247
01:52:23,539 --> 01:52:38,520
Why is it?

1248
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:50,149
What did I do?

1249
01:52:50,149 --> 01:52:51,829
What did I do to get that to change?

1250
01:52:51,829 --> 01:52:52,069
What?

1251
01:52:52,069 --> 01:52:52,789
Wait, what did I do?

1252
01:52:52,789 --> 01:52:53,430
What did I do?

1253
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:54,729
I did something weird.

1254
01:52:54,729 --> 01:52:55,210
I went through.

1255
01:52:55,210 --> 01:53:00,739
Wait, what?

1256
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:01,800
I did it.

1257
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:02,119
All right.

1258
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:02,520
I got it.

1259
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:02,840
I got it.

1260
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,899
I got it.

1261
01:53:05,899 --> 01:53:07,180
Oh, that's not good.

1262
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:16,359
What changed?

1263
01:53:16,359 --> 01:53:17,239
What what's changing?

1264
01:53:17,239 --> 01:53:21,050
What am I doing differently?

1265
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:23,960
What am I doing differently when I walk through the door?

1266
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:26,659
What am I doing differently?

1267
01:53:26,659 --> 01:53:27,779
Something is changing.

1268
01:53:27,779 --> 01:53:30,020
I'm going through a weird where I'm doing it weird.

1269
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:30,659
What am I doing?

1270
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,460
What changed?

1271
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:38,229
Hold on.

1272
01:53:38,229 --> 01:53:49,380
Wait, what?

1273
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,180
Why is it?

1274
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:57,079
Did I have it right with the go through backwards thing?

1275
01:53:57,079 --> 01:54:31,529
I don't get it.

1276
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:15,619
All right.

1277
01:55:15,619 --> 01:55:16,180
I have an idea.

1278
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:32,520
What?

1279
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:39,350
That's not right.

1280
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:41,289
OK, hold on.

1281
01:55:41,289 --> 01:55:50,890
One, two, then this one is legit.

1282
01:55:50,890 --> 01:55:52,090
Oh, my fucking God.

1283
01:55:52,090 --> 01:56:06,840
What's going on?

1284
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,819
If I look to the left, it's going to be the dead end.

1285
01:56:09,819 --> 01:56:11,609
So I got to look to the right.

1286
01:56:11,609 --> 01:56:14,680
I got it.

1287
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:22,649
OK, if I look to the right, it's going to be the dead end.

1288
01:56:22,649 --> 01:56:28,819
If I look to the left, it's going to be the dead end.

1289
01:56:28,819 --> 01:56:29,539
OK, I got it.

1290
01:56:29,539 --> 01:56:29,859
I got it.

1291
01:56:29,859 --> 01:56:30,100
I got it.

1292
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:30,340
I got it.

1293
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:41,159
That was confusing.

1294
01:56:41,159 --> 01:56:42,039
Jump map.

1295
01:56:42,039 --> 01:56:53,270
Where did that go?

1296
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:53,829
What?

1297
01:56:53,829 --> 01:56:55,270
Oh, that's weird.

1298
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:56,619
That's confusing.

1299
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:15,399
Good vibes and chat.

1300
01:57:15,399 --> 01:57:16,039
Good.

1301
01:57:16,039 --> 01:57:23,399
That makes me happy.

1302
01:57:23,399 --> 01:57:27,939
Every patient, you must understand it's possible to completely

1303
01:57:27,939 --> 01:57:32,390
exhaust your supply of dreams, thereby entering a state in which

1304
01:57:32,390 --> 01:57:36,470
you will not be able to wake up even with the help of triggering mechanisms.

1305
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:42,010
This game is pretty fun.

1306
01:57:43,399 --> 01:57:44,699
I didn't say cute.

1307
01:57:44,699 --> 01:57:45,579
I said fun.

1308
01:57:45,579 --> 01:58:00,380
I got to get out of this room before everyone sees how ugly I am.

1309
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:04,420
Bright light in my face.

1310
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:05,300
All right, we're good.

1311
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:22,310
What the hell?

1312
01:58:22,310 --> 01:59:17,979
OK, I don't get it.

1313
01:59:17,979 --> 01:59:19,930
This one has lights over it.

1314
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:24,380
It's that one.

1315
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:24,779
This one.

1316
01:59:24,779 --> 01:59:26,460
OK, this one has lights over it.

1317
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:27,699
So it's this one.

1318
01:59:27,699 --> 01:59:30,119
This one has lights over it.

1319
01:59:30,119 --> 01:59:30,600
This one.

1320
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,279
Oh, they all have lights over it.

1321
01:59:32,279 --> 02:00:36,600
Interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting.

1322
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:37,960
I'm looking for the arrows on the ground.

1323
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:38,680
Here we go.

1324
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:47,779
There's an arrow on this ground.

1325
02:00:47,779 --> 02:01:12,630
I don't get it.

1326
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:15,050
Follow the arrow?

1327
02:01:15,050 --> 02:01:23,579
That's what I did.

1328
02:01:23,579 --> 02:01:24,539
There's no more arrows.

1329
02:01:24,539 --> 02:01:35,029
Where's the other arrows?

1330
02:01:35,029 --> 02:01:36,739
Where are the other arrows?

1331
02:01:36,739 --> 02:01:38,020
Just keep going?

1332
02:01:38,020 --> 02:02:18,100
I don't think I'm doing this right.

1333
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:18,340
Why?

1334
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:19,140
That was correct.

1335
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:19,699
Holy shit.

1336
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:20,340
Get me out of there.

1337
02:02:32,140 --> 02:02:40,500
This is trippy.

1338
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:58,199
Wait, there's a wall.

1339
02:02:58,199 --> 02:03:00,520
Oh, that's weird.

1340
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:05,460
I don't like that.

1341
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:07,140
Oh, I don't like that either.

1342
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:12,489
I don't like that either.

1343
02:03:12,489 --> 02:03:21,060
Oh, is this going to turn into a...

1344
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:24,340
Yeah, OK.

1345
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:26,100
So what is the right way?

1346
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:47,590
OK, it's this way.

1347
02:03:47,590 --> 02:03:48,789
Wait, what the hell is...

1348
02:03:48,789 --> 02:03:52,140
It's closing in.

1349
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:32,630
Is this like a coffee shop?

1350
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:44,310
What's over here?

1351
02:04:44,310 --> 02:05:07,880
Oh, am I picking up my own box?

1352
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:11,270
What the hell is going on here?

1353
02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:34,579
I want it to be bigger.

1354
02:05:34,579 --> 02:06:34,550
What's going on here?

1355
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:44,970
Hold on.

1356
02:06:44,970 --> 02:06:45,529
I got to...

1357
02:06:45,529 --> 02:06:52,520
What should I do with this?

1358
02:07:06,199 --> 02:07:09,739
Ow.

1359
02:07:09,739 --> 02:07:44,340
Oh, shit.

1360
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:45,300
I can get in there.

1361
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:55,880
What did I do?

1362
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:57,510
What did I do?

1363
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:58,390
What did I do?

1364
02:07:58,390 --> 02:07:59,210
What did I do wrong?

1365
02:07:59,529 --> 02:08:01,109
What did I do wrong?

1366
02:08:01,109 --> 02:08:05,430
I did something wrong.

1367
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:06,229
What did I do?

1368
02:08:06,229 --> 02:08:07,189
I broke something.

1369
02:08:07,189 --> 02:08:11,899
How do I get out of here?

1370
02:08:11,899 --> 02:08:35,779
All right, I got to be small.

1371
02:08:35,779 --> 02:08:36,659
Small enough to open.

1372
02:08:36,659 --> 02:08:37,699
All right, I'm going this way.

1373
02:08:37,699 --> 02:09:01,930
This thing is going to say fucking forever.

1374
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:02,970
Earwig POV.

1375
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:05,180
Why did you do that?

1376
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:07,399
Because I wasn't big enough to go in the back door.

1377
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:47,659
What I meant to say,

1378
02:09:47,659 --> 02:09:51,159
I wasn't small enough to go in the back door

1379
02:09:51,159 --> 02:09:54,920
because I need to be tall enough to...

1380
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:56,359
I have to be a certain height.

1381
02:09:57,189 --> 02:09:58,630
Why are your hands so white?

1382
02:09:58,630 --> 02:10:02,310
Because there's a big light right here.

1383
02:10:02,310 --> 02:10:04,250
Oh, my God.

1384
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:05,529
No, get this out of the way.

1385
02:10:10,949 --> 02:10:11,750
I need that.

1386
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:20,149
I need that thing.

1387
02:10:20,149 --> 02:10:21,189
Oh, it's gone.

1388
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:22,390
I hope I don't need it.

1389
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:25,720
Why am I going so slow?

1390
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:34,579
Why am I walking so slow?

1391
02:10:57,020 --> 02:10:58,859
I'm an atom?

1392
02:10:58,859 --> 02:10:59,979
Microscopic Andy.

1393
02:10:59,979 --> 02:11:00,939
Just go to the checkpoint.

1394
02:11:08,729 --> 02:11:16,229
Why am I doing this?

1395
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:16,710
Wait, what?

1396
02:11:40,229 --> 02:11:47,670
Where am I?

1397
02:11:47,670 --> 02:11:57,420
Now, I need to be both in the town

1398
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:59,340
and not in the town at the same time.

1399
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:14,010
Okay, where's this door that I was looking at earlier?

1400
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:24,520
Right back here, right?

1401
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:25,159
Right here.

1402
02:12:25,159 --> 02:12:27,029
I can't get in this?

1403
02:12:27,029 --> 02:12:36,949
Okay, never mind.

1404
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:45,079
So I was doing it right before.

1405
02:12:45,079 --> 02:12:46,760
I have to bring this in here

1406
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:48,760
and just fuck the whole thing up, right?

1407
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:58,489
Ah, you made it to the giant antenna.

1408
02:13:58,489 --> 02:14:00,659
I'm the electrician.

1409
02:14:00,659 --> 02:14:04,229
I created this world.

1410
02:14:04,229 --> 02:14:06,949
400 years ago, humanity fell into darkness.

1411
02:14:06,949 --> 02:14:48,409
Is that where we're going to get one of those?

1412
02:14:48,409 --> 02:14:50,409
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

1413
02:14:51,050 --> 02:14:55,380
And many years ago, I had a dream.

1414
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:58,420
I found myself in a place where I understood

1415
02:14:58,420 --> 02:15:00,659
that each of us begins as nothing,

1416
02:15:01,619 --> 02:15:03,859
where everything I perceived was shaped

1417
02:15:03,859 --> 02:15:06,260
by seeing it exactly the way I wanted to.

1418
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:07,460
I'm telling you, listen to the person in your dream

1419
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:08,899
when you ask them for the best invention.

1420
02:15:08,899 --> 02:15:14,260
If you have the opportunity and you're in a dream

1421
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:15,619
and you can talk to somebody, say,

1422
02:15:15,619 --> 02:15:17,380
what's the greatest invention that's not,

1423
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:19,960
that doesn't exist that you know?

1424
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:20,840
They will give you,

1425
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:21,960
make sure you write it down when you wake up.

1426
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:15,960
You know what, how do you even make this in a game engine?

1427
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:22,550
That's what I want to know.

1428
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:25,909
How do you do this in Unreal or something?

1429
02:16:25,909 --> 02:16:34,420
It's just cameras, lots of math and lots of cameras.

1430
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:45,350
You mask out all the cameras.

1431
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:47,530
That's cool.

1432
02:16:47,530 --> 02:17:11,219
Can I pick anything up?

1433
02:17:11,219 --> 02:17:43,100
Door.

1434
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:44,459
So who's the architect?

1435
02:17:44,459 --> 02:17:48,059
Who's the dream architect?

1436
02:17:48,059 --> 02:17:52,139
Is it me or is it him?

1437
02:17:52,139 --> 02:18:03,540
Oh shit.

1438
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:18,010
But in white space,

1439
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:20,969
I also faced the greatest challenge I could imagine

1440
02:18:21,930 --> 02:18:25,690
because with a lifetime of life itself behind me

1441
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:27,610
and all of the weight that it carried,

1442
02:18:28,329 --> 02:18:31,690
I realized that seeing things the way I wanted to

1443
02:18:31,690 --> 02:18:33,770
was not as easy as it used to be.

1444
02:18:34,329 --> 02:18:41,350
I don't want the afterlife to be like this.

1445
02:18:41,350 --> 02:18:44,040
Every time people think of the afterlife,

1446
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:46,520
oh, heaven, oh my God, I'm moving on.

1447
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,840
They're floating as a specter.

1448
02:18:50,420 --> 02:18:51,299
Oh, wow.

1449
02:18:51,299 --> 02:18:51,780
Look at it.

1450
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:53,219
So Elizabeth's mist everywhere.

1451
02:18:53,219 --> 02:18:55,219
Everything's misty and you're floating.

1452
02:18:55,219 --> 02:18:56,579
No, I don't want it to be like this.

1453
02:18:56,579 --> 02:19:08,739
Eternity is a long time.

1454
02:19:08,739 --> 02:19:15,270
I'd get sick of that.

1455
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:15,989
Don't worry.

1456
02:19:15,989 --> 02:19:17,350
You're not going to heaven.

1457
02:19:17,350 --> 02:19:27,379
So I don't have to worry about it.

1458
02:19:27,379 --> 02:19:28,340
So I'll be all right.

1459
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:38,120
How do I get up here?

1460
02:19:38,120 --> 02:20:06,780
How do I get up here?

1461
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:15,190
It's all dogs go to heaven, not Jeremy's.

1462
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:26,870
It's all about perspective.

1463
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:37,079
Okay, like close your eyes.

1464
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:39,049
Oh, heaven.

1465
02:20:39,049 --> 02:20:40,170
This is heaven.

1466
02:20:40,170 --> 02:20:45,819
I would freak out after 20 minutes.

1467
02:20:45,819 --> 02:20:51,829
If I was just floating around just hearing this song

1468
02:20:51,829 --> 02:20:55,020
and if I opened my eyes

1469
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:57,020
and it was like, oh, there's like grandpa

1470
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:59,579
and like my great, great, great grandfather,

1471
02:20:59,579 --> 02:21:00,540
my great, great, wow.

1472
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:02,540
We all floated around.

1473
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:03,659
I'd be like, well, this sucks.

1474
02:21:04,299 --> 02:21:04,940
What can we do?

1475
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:06,540
Can we do anything else with this?

1476
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:17,379
I don't like afterlife thoughts.

1477
02:21:17,379 --> 02:21:18,979
That's weird to me because I don't know.

1478
02:21:18,979 --> 02:21:21,639
We all know what this is like.

1479
02:21:21,639 --> 02:21:24,920
So changing our plane of existence in reality

1480
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:27,180
drastically is too much.

1481
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:28,620
We know too much.

1482
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:33,000
We've experienced too many things.

1483
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:33,879
Just play the game.

1484
02:21:33,879 --> 02:21:36,440
I'm stalling because I can't go up the stairs, man.

1485
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:56,420
Just walk.

1486
02:21:56,420 --> 02:22:03,319
Oh, I did that like five times.

1487
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:22,200
I can't wait to hang out with my great, great, great grandfather.

1488
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:24,760
The guy that ran the cigarette factory.

1489
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:26,819
I don't want to hang out with that guy.

1490
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:46,569
I don't want to meet the caveman ancestor.

1491
02:22:46,569 --> 02:22:49,059
They're all going to be there.

1492
02:22:49,059 --> 02:22:54,729
I think we all think of like, oh, grandpa and pa

1493
02:22:54,729 --> 02:23:00,379
and like Uga and Uga is going to be there.

1494
02:23:00,379 --> 02:23:04,520
It's going to be everyone.

1495
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:05,799
It's going to be too many people.

1496
02:23:05,799 --> 02:23:09,420
There's going to be like a trillion people up there.

1497
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:11,909
That's that we've fucked up.

1498
02:23:11,909 --> 02:23:15,430
Everybody's caveman ancestors walking around.

1499
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:21,590
Every human that you've ever come from, ever.

1500
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:23,590
You, your group is going to be the most,

1501
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:26,600
it's going to be the most annoying family reunion ever.

1502
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:29,000
Going around and shaking every one of their hands

1503
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,510
of like the 500 fucking people.

1504
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:33,430
You know, when you go to an event and you're like,

1505
02:23:33,430 --> 02:23:35,190
well, I can't wait to have the same conversation

1506
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:37,110
with this person and this person and this person

1507
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:38,709
and say goodbye a thousand times.

1508
02:23:38,709 --> 02:23:40,659
That's what's going to happen.

1509
02:23:40,659 --> 02:23:52,840
Except it's, where are you going to go?

1510
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:54,680
Yeah, and what if Uga is a piece of shit?

1511
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:55,639
What if he's a dick?

1512
02:23:55,639 --> 02:23:56,600
I don't want to hang out with him.

1513
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:58,120
I don't want to spend time with Uga.

1514
02:23:58,120 --> 02:24:12,280
No, I don't want to go to hell either because guess what?

1515
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:13,559
You know, there's going to be somebody there

1516
02:24:13,559 --> 02:24:16,120
that's going to be like, yeah, yeah, it's fine.

1517
02:24:17,420 --> 02:24:17,979
Everything, man.

1518
02:24:17,979 --> 02:24:19,260
I'm glad to be down here.

1519
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:21,579
It's like, I don't want to be with the one

1520
02:24:21,579 --> 02:24:24,780
like distant great, great, great uncle that went to hell

1521
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:26,379
and hang out with him every day.

1522
02:24:26,379 --> 02:24:29,260
Oh, that's going to be fun.

1523
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:36,500
Oh, me, drunk, great, great, great, great uncle Frank

1524
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:39,620
and some random caveman that bashed in 50 people's skulls

1525
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:41,559
are the only ones that are going to be down here.

1526
02:24:41,559 --> 02:24:42,680
That would be a disaster.

1527
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:45,530
It'd be horrible.

1528
02:24:45,770 --> 02:24:49,290
No, dark Uga.

1529
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:05,079
Dark Uga.

1530
02:25:14,809 --> 02:25:15,770
They both kind of suck.

1531
02:25:27,959 --> 02:25:31,079
I don't want to be on my best behavior in heaven every day.

1532
02:25:31,079 --> 02:25:35,049
You know, if like grandma's around, like I have to,

1533
02:25:35,049 --> 02:25:37,209
I have to, I got to hang out with grandma all the time

1534
02:25:37,209 --> 02:25:39,129
and I got to, I'm not going to be like, oh, fuck you,

1535
02:25:39,129 --> 02:25:40,329
fuck this and fuck you.

1536
02:25:40,329 --> 02:25:42,809
No, I'm going to be, I'm going to have to mute it down a little.

1537
02:25:42,809 --> 02:25:45,940
You don't talk to your grandparents like that.

1538
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:47,059
I don't want to do that.

1539
02:25:47,059 --> 02:25:53,110
But great, great, great, drunk uncle Frank and dark Uga

1540
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:54,569
are going to be doing coke every day.

1541
02:25:54,569 --> 02:25:55,690
I don't want to do coke every day.

1542
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:56,649
I don't want to do coke.

1543
02:25:56,649 --> 02:26:08,790
Did I pick the wrong one?

1544
02:26:08,790 --> 02:26:09,670
What did I just do?

1545
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:20,409
Oh, just water down the sugar.

1546
02:26:20,409 --> 02:26:21,690
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1547
02:26:21,690 --> 02:26:25,860
All right, so what am I doing here?

1548
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:26,500
No.

1549
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:34,100
Okay, I'm going down this one.

1550
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:37,780
Yeah, and also I know people have made this reference before too,

1551
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:40,739
but I don't want to answer to my great, great, great grandfather,

1552
02:26:40,739 --> 02:26:45,540
some great man that created the first steel mill in America

1553
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:46,500
or whatever it is.

1554
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:50,620
I have to answer to this person.

1555
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:53,129
He probably thinks I'm an idiot.

1556
02:26:53,129 --> 02:26:54,250
He probably thinks I'm an asshole.

1557
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:55,909
He probably thinks I'm stupid.

1558
02:26:55,909 --> 02:26:59,829
I'm the caveman to my great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather.

1559
02:26:59,829 --> 02:27:05,959
He will think I am insane.

1560
02:27:05,959 --> 02:27:28,010
Can I like fall through here?

1561
02:27:28,010 --> 02:27:28,969
Oh shit.

1562
02:27:28,969 --> 02:27:34,459
Okay, this one's safe.

1563
02:27:34,459 --> 02:27:40,549
Is this one safe too?

1564
02:27:40,549 --> 02:27:42,260
I think.

1565
02:27:42,260 --> 02:27:56,340
You can tell him he made half a million dollars selling ass baseballs

1566
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:57,139
and he'd be impressed.

1567
02:27:57,139 --> 02:27:57,940
No, he wouldn't.

1568
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:01,899
He'd be like, what have you done?

1569
02:28:01,899 --> 02:28:04,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, sit here.

1570
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:05,000
What have you done?

1571
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,389
It's like, I don't want to talk about putting baseballs up my ass.

1572
02:28:08,389 --> 02:28:18,920
No, no, no.

1573
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:20,600
Oh, what an idiot.

1574
02:28:23,989 --> 02:28:26,870
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that can't be.

1575
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:31,459
Dude, I was right there.

1576
02:28:31,459 --> 02:28:32,180
I'm sorry.

1577
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:32,500
I know.

1578
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:34,020
I'm just talking.

1579
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:44,459
It's more important to focus on what you enjoy in life.

1580
02:28:45,020 --> 02:28:45,500
Yeah.

1581
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:48,680
Okay.

1582
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:57,100
You know, the cafeteria sounds, you know, just loud, indistinct chatter.

1583
02:28:57,100 --> 02:29:01,559
That's what it's going to be like.

1584
02:29:01,559 --> 02:29:04,780
Except times a hundred trillion.

1585
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:08,100
Where are we all going to be?

1586
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:09,700
Is there a hotel room?

1587
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:11,540
Is there accommodations?

1588
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:13,620
Or are we all just floating around a trillion people?

1589
02:29:13,620 --> 02:29:17,239
Like, is there a heaven hotel?

1590
02:29:17,239 --> 02:29:17,479
Right?

1591
02:29:17,479 --> 02:29:18,360
Like, think about it.

1592
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:20,760
How does, how would logistically that work?

1593
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:26,459
Heaven is infinite.

1594
02:29:26,459 --> 02:29:29,530
But what do you mean?

1595
02:29:41,479 --> 02:29:43,959
I didn't sign up for an existential crisis tonight.

1596
02:29:43,959 --> 02:29:46,579
Well, look at the game we're playing.

1597
02:29:46,579 --> 02:29:48,819
It's a pretty good topic for what we're doing.

1598
02:29:48,819 --> 02:30:13,719
Cheese wheel and the, oh, right.

1599
02:30:13,719 --> 02:30:14,040
Okay.

1600
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:15,700
Thank you.

1601
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:16,340
Thank you.

1602
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:25,510
There's no concept of time in heaven.

1603
02:30:25,510 --> 02:30:32,940
I know, but I don't, I like worldly stuff.

1604
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:33,579
You know what I mean?

1605
02:30:34,139 --> 02:30:37,100
I don't want to be like a floating specter.

1606
02:30:37,739 --> 02:30:40,940
I want to, I want to be able to watch Frickin' Morty, okay?

1607
02:30:40,940 --> 02:31:07,209
And I was like, oh, but will you be one with the cosmos?

1608
02:31:07,209 --> 02:31:07,909
Okay, cool.

1609
02:31:07,909 --> 02:31:10,469
But do I get to pull some levers and do some cool shit with planets?

1610
02:31:10,469 --> 02:31:11,510
Can I make a planet or something?

1611
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:12,870
Like, do I get to do anything like that?

1612
02:31:12,870 --> 02:31:16,540
It's going to be really hard to replace Frickin' Morty.

1613
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:17,659
I mean, it's got to be good.

1614
02:31:17,659 --> 02:31:21,940
I mean, like crafting planets and being a part of like the cosmos.

1615
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:24,180
I mean, is that as good as, it's got to,

1616
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:32,809
will it even compare to Rick and Morty?

1617
02:31:32,809 --> 02:31:35,049
You will be Rick and Morty.

1618
02:31:35,049 --> 02:31:37,079
Okay.

1619
02:31:37,079 --> 02:31:37,719
I can't look at this.

1620
02:31:37,719 --> 02:31:38,760
I'm going to look over here.

1621
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:45,450
What did you say?

1622
02:31:45,450 --> 02:31:47,700
This is Mormonism?

1623
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:48,729
Is it?

1624
02:31:48,729 --> 02:31:49,610
Wait, what do you mean?

1625
02:31:49,610 --> 02:31:52,790
Wait, what do you mean?

1626
02:31:52,790 --> 02:31:53,270
What do you mean?

1627
02:31:53,350 --> 02:31:54,229
What are you talking about?

1628
02:31:54,229 --> 02:32:22,790
Wait, Mormons, Mormons, you create planets?

1629
02:32:22,790 --> 02:32:23,909
Making planets?

1630
02:32:23,909 --> 02:32:28,219
You become a god and make a planet.

1631
02:32:28,219 --> 02:32:52,389
You get your own planet that you were the god of when you die.

1632
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:57,780
You and your first wife get a planet.

1633
02:32:57,780 --> 02:32:58,819
That sounds fucking awesome.

1634
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:05,479
That's sick.

1635
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:10,120
That's fucking sick.

1636
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:11,319
Wait, I just said a bad word.

1637
02:33:11,319 --> 02:33:12,760
Is that bad?

1638
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:13,879
I don't think I can do it anymore.

1639
02:33:13,879 --> 02:33:16,520
Oh, well, I was a Mormon for five seconds.

1640
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:30,709
My name is, you see, everyone who comes to these,

1641
02:33:30,709 --> 02:33:38,229
they feel that they are no longer in control of something important.

1642
02:33:38,790 --> 02:33:44,409
Now you don't get a planet minus one planet.

1643
02:33:44,409 --> 02:33:58,940
But news to see our problems from it.

1644
02:33:58,940 --> 02:34:03,739
So we do the same things again and again and again.

1645
02:34:03,739 --> 02:34:05,690
They're in, of course.

1646
02:34:05,690 --> 02:34:08,489
We find exactly the failure we were looking for.

1647
02:34:27,829 --> 02:34:29,430
You guys are fucking hilarious.

1648
02:34:29,430 --> 02:34:39,260
Whatever doesn't work like that.

1649
02:34:39,819 --> 02:34:43,739
Somebody said, hey, dude, you could have my planet like when I'm gone.

1650
02:34:44,219 --> 02:34:45,899
You can't just give the planet.

1651
02:34:45,899 --> 02:34:47,100
That's not how it works.

1652
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:50,659
You can't just give me your planet because you went through all the

1653
02:34:50,659 --> 02:34:52,260
you were a faithful person.

1654
02:34:52,260 --> 02:34:53,059
That's not how it works.

1655
02:35:06,379 --> 02:35:07,180
There's a bug in here.

1656
02:35:20,069 --> 02:35:30,870
A lot of chess themes that we persevered.

1657
02:35:31,770 --> 02:35:33,049
We took different ways.

1658
02:35:33,049 --> 02:35:35,209
We we made our own path.

1659
02:35:37,819 --> 02:35:43,899
And here's a planet just for you.

1660
02:35:43,899 --> 02:35:51,000
A few minutes, you'll be back in the room.

1661
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,120
Some part of you will say that none of this was real.

1662
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:57,639
So how could it have really meant anything?

1663
02:35:57,639 --> 02:36:01,799
But just like the power of perspective itself,

1664
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:05,639
it will have been as real as you believed it to be.

1665
02:36:07,079 --> 02:36:09,399
All you've got to do is wait.

1666
02:36:16,809 --> 02:36:24,059
That was a good game.

1667
02:36:24,059 --> 02:36:26,469
That was really good.

1668
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:29,190
That was a nice few hour experience.

1669
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:29,989
That's cool.

1670
02:36:29,989 --> 02:36:32,420
I very much enjoyed that.

1671
02:36:32,420 --> 02:36:40,819
That's good.

1672
02:36:40,819 --> 02:36:47,319
Go back to Mythbusters.

1673
02:36:47,319 --> 02:36:49,000
I'm not going to do that.

1674
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,090
That game was cute.

1675
02:36:50,809 --> 02:36:51,450
What's wrong with it?

1676
02:36:51,450 --> 02:36:57,049
Nothing wrong with it.

1677
02:36:57,049 --> 02:37:07,979
I like this song.

1678
02:37:07,979 --> 02:37:08,860
Long stream.

1679
02:37:08,860 --> 02:37:11,100
Um, not long at all, actually.

1680
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:22,620
This started at 7 p.m.

1681
02:37:22,620 --> 02:37:24,059
This is a late night stream.

1682
02:37:24,059 --> 02:37:25,559
So I didn't go long.

1683
02:37:25,559 --> 02:37:26,440
Pretty normal length.

1684
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:29,899
Five hours or so.

1685
02:37:29,899 --> 02:37:30,379
That's cool.

1686
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:33,079
Here's the plan for this week.

1687
02:37:33,079 --> 02:37:35,479
Uh, I'm not going to stream tomorrow,

1688
02:37:35,479 --> 02:37:38,219
but I'll be live the next day.

1689
02:37:38,219 --> 02:37:41,399
We I'll be live on well tomorrow.

1690
02:37:41,399 --> 02:37:41,959
Okay.

1691
02:37:41,959 --> 02:37:44,920
So technically we're talking about Thursday is when I'm streaming.

1692
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:46,860
So I'm not streaming today.

1693
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:47,500
Wednesday.

1694
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:48,940
Technically, I'm streaming on Thursday.

1695
02:37:48,940 --> 02:37:51,079
I'm going to play multiverses.

1696
02:37:51,079 --> 02:37:53,159
I think it's going to be sponsored.

1697
02:37:53,159 --> 02:37:57,670
It's going to be I'm going to be playing a lot of gizmo.

1698
02:37:57,670 --> 02:38:01,850
I'm actually looking really forward to it.

1699
02:38:01,850 --> 02:38:02,809
Morty came out too.

1700
02:38:02,809 --> 02:38:05,129
I didn't play it, but I'm you bet your ass.

1701
02:38:05,129 --> 02:38:08,899
I want to play it when gizmos out.

1702
02:38:08,899 --> 02:38:12,170
Uh, that is not the only thing we're going to do.

1703
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:16,139
We will do something else as well from gremlins.

1704
02:38:16,139 --> 02:38:17,610
Yep.

1705
02:38:17,610 --> 02:38:20,250
Gizmo from gremlins is going to be in multiverses.

1706
02:38:21,209 --> 02:38:22,969
I whenever they put it in.

1707
02:38:23,530 --> 02:38:38,979
How come you don't have a graphic tea of gremlins too?

1708
02:38:38,979 --> 02:38:40,729
They don't even make them.

1709
02:38:40,729 --> 02:38:41,049
Do they?

1710
02:38:41,049 --> 02:38:45,459
I mean, I don't know.

1711
02:38:45,459 --> 02:38:47,139
Yeah, we'll play multiverses and we'll do something else.

1712
02:38:47,139 --> 02:38:47,540
Maybe.

1713
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:48,260
I don't know.

1714
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:52,979
I would say sorcery, but kind of want that to be its own thing.

1715
02:38:55,739 --> 02:38:57,579
We'll start with something else.

1716
02:38:58,219 --> 02:38:59,659
We'll move to multiverses.

1717
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:05,819
So for those of you that don't, uh, not into multiverses, that's fine.

1718
02:39:05,819 --> 02:39:06,780
We'll start with something else.

1719
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:07,819
We'll move on to multiverses.

1720
02:39:07,819 --> 02:39:09,739
Although I, I mean, obviously it's a sponsored stream.

1721
02:39:09,739 --> 02:39:17,479
So you, uh, you know, come, come hang out, split tune,

1722
02:39:17,479 --> 02:39:27,930
but we'll do something for a little bit before.

1723
02:39:27,930 --> 02:39:28,170
Yeah.

1724
02:39:28,170 --> 02:39:31,450
I have no idea if gizmo is coming out or not.

1725
02:39:31,450 --> 02:39:34,020
I know that he's supposed to soon.

1726
02:39:34,020 --> 02:39:44,250
I'm going to have wicked.

1727
02:39:44,250 --> 02:39:45,049
Yeah, they already announced it.

1728
02:39:45,049 --> 02:39:52,940
They announced gizmo, but Disney infinity.

1729
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:54,379
Is it September 8th?

1730
02:39:54,379 --> 02:39:56,940
I that's a, I hope so.

1731
02:39:56,940 --> 02:40:01,079
I'm under the impression that it was happening soon.

1732
02:40:01,079 --> 02:40:04,309
Make a tier list.

1733
02:40:04,309 --> 02:40:07,909
I'm not going to read that stream sooner.

1734
02:40:08,149 --> 02:40:09,909
This is not a normal stream time for me.

1735
02:40:09,909 --> 02:40:12,340
This is completely out of the ordinary.

1736
02:40:12,340 --> 02:40:16,219
I just had stuff going on this afternoon.

1737
02:40:16,219 --> 02:40:20,809
Uh, you can expect most streams to start somewhere around three or four Pacific,

1738
02:40:20,809 --> 02:40:26,940
which is exactly precisely when we will start playing, um, on Thursday.

1739
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:29,239
We'll start around four o'clock.

1740
02:40:29,239 --> 02:40:31,000
We'll move to multiverses.

1741
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:34,969
Probably around maybe some, but there might be around six or seven.

1742
02:40:34,969 --> 02:40:36,899
Maybe play that for a few hours.

1743
02:40:36,899 --> 02:40:40,920
He was supposed to be out today.

1744
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:41,079
Okay.

1745
02:40:41,079 --> 02:40:42,680
Well, then that makes sense.

1746
02:40:42,680 --> 02:40:51,059
Or is too late.

1747
02:40:51,059 --> 02:40:53,719
Not for me.

1748
02:40:53,719 --> 02:40:56,440
Not for me.

1749
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:56,760
All right.

1750
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:57,319
That's it guys.

1751
02:40:57,319 --> 02:40:58,200
I'll see you later.

1752
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:00,409
I'll see you on Thursday.

1753
02:41:00,409 --> 02:41:04,309
Uh, I'm glad to kind of be back to normal now.

1754
02:41:04,309 --> 02:41:06,420
Just kind of hanging out.

1755
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:08,469
Although name your price was a ton of fun.

1756
02:41:08,469 --> 02:41:09,190
And hey, Donna was too.

1757
02:41:09,190 --> 02:41:11,940
If you didn't see that, uh, that was a blast.

1758
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:13,860
I had a ton of fun on those streams.

1759
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:15,530
That was a lot of fun.

1760
02:41:15,530 --> 02:41:19,129
Austin is awesome.

1761
02:41:19,129 --> 02:41:27,049
It's actually the first time I've really spent any significant time with Austin.

1762
02:41:27,049 --> 02:41:29,620
And will too, for that matter.

1763
02:41:29,620 --> 02:41:30,739
I hung out with him.

1764
02:41:30,739 --> 02:41:36,329
I talked to them briefly at the streamer awards and we said,

1765
02:41:36,329 --> 02:41:38,250
oh yeah, we'll do something together sometime.

1766
02:41:38,250 --> 02:41:38,649
Cool.

1767
02:41:38,649 --> 02:41:38,969
Yeah.

1768
02:41:38,969 --> 02:41:39,129
Yeah.

1769
02:41:39,129 --> 02:41:40,729
And it's like, oh, let's do this.

1770
02:41:40,729 --> 02:41:41,530
They have that show.

1771
02:41:41,530 --> 02:41:43,610
We got, hey, Donna, we got, uh, name your price.

1772
02:41:43,610 --> 02:41:44,809
And I'm like, fucking let's go.

1773
02:41:44,809 --> 02:41:54,409
You had sensational drip.

1774
02:41:54,409 --> 02:41:54,729
Yeah.

1775
02:41:54,729 --> 02:41:56,280
Uh, they're awesome.

1776
02:41:56,280 --> 02:41:58,360
It was really cool to, uh, participate in their shows.

1777
02:41:58,360 --> 02:41:59,879
I thought they were really well made.

1778
02:41:59,879 --> 02:42:01,450
They were really well done.

1779
02:42:01,450 --> 02:42:05,909
So it was a good experience.

1780
02:42:05,909 --> 02:42:06,149
All right.

1781
02:42:06,149 --> 02:42:07,270
I'll see you guys later.

1782
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:08,680
Take care of yourselves.

1783
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:09,239
Goodbye.

1784
02:42:09,239 --> 02:42:09,959
Good night.

1785
02:42:09,959 --> 02:42:10,860
Probably mother.

1786
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:11,659
You know the deal.

1787
02:42:11,659 --> 02:42:26,809
Oh, also when I jumped up on the chair and freaked everybody out,

1788
02:42:26,809 --> 02:42:28,600
I saw somebody commented.

1789
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:32,500
I saw a comment saying, guys, maybe he can dodge a battle X.

1790
02:42:34,600 --> 02:42:35,559
So now you believe me.

1791
02:42:35,559 --> 02:42:51,030
I'm glad I'm convincing you, uh, more and more every day.

1792
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:51,989
I saw that comment.

1793
02:42:51,989 --> 02:42:53,270
I saw it had some upvotes.

1794
02:42:53,270 --> 02:42:55,670
I was like, yes, yes, you get it.

1795
02:42:55,670 --> 02:43:02,860
Glad you didn't eat shit.

1796
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:07,370
No, I wouldn't.

1797
02:43:07,370 --> 02:43:07,930
I wouldn't.

1798
02:43:07,930 --> 02:43:12,409
I might have some pain issues in my kind of upper chest and back,

1799
02:43:12,409 --> 02:43:14,469
but I can still move.

1800
02:43:14,469 --> 02:43:15,750
I can still move buster.

1801
02:43:15,750 --> 02:43:35,370
That was a weird laugh.

1802
02:43:35,370 --> 02:43:35,770
I'm sorry.

1803
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:38,010
And usually there's music to mask how weird that would sound,

1804
02:43:38,010 --> 02:43:39,209
