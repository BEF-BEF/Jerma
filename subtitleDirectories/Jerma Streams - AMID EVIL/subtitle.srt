18
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,689
i might have to lower it a little bit more

19
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:51,129
easy difficulty less enemies more pickups uh no medium difficulty normal enemies and pickups

20
00:03:51,129 --> 00:04:05,270

25
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:17,639
i was just doing oh man you the momentum is so fast this is like walking your grandmother across

26
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,680
a fucking road and then now you have to fly an airplane by the way walking your grandmother

27

it's all right whatever evil has overrun our sacred lands free them visit the two worlds to

30
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:28,310

31
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:40,199
where i can go wherever what's up here i see return to difficulty selection i don't want to

32
00:06:40,199 --> 00:07:02,420

across the street i should have called an uber for grandma then this would now i should have just

34
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:22,939
started with this instead of walking grandma across the street for a fucking hour it's actually

35
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:40,439
pretty tricky damn the fucking forward momentum is so much okay so where do i go this doesn't open

this is a dream please wake up no i have a fucking hernia and they also think i have fucking

251
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:43,539
costochondritis which essentially is your rib bones it's just like your rib cage just hurts

252
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:53,060
which is that's pretty much what it is that's pretty much it this testicle goes up into your

253
01:10:53,380 --> 01:11:03,300
stomach uh you need you need to read a few medicine books that's not what that is by the way

257
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:12,970
weapon in the game it kills them instantly one hit on these guys and they're dead 120 120 130

258
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:29,819
130 140 140 120 120 all right i'm gonna i got 20 of these shots what's next under the button

259
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:47,720

260
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:55,180
if that's really what's going on i might have to go get like an injection i've looked up a bunch

261
01:12:55,180 --> 01:13:01,659
of stuff that trust me in the last three or four days has been pretty much only me looking up what

262
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:25,960
the fuck any of this stuff even means rejection not necessarily no no oh my god who's left

263
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:50,739
sequence complete all right wait don't leave anything behind here oh that was it 50 of the

264
01:13:50,739 --> 01:14:02,890
secrets completed is the bitrate suffering this is the way that the game is encoded into this into

265
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:16,619
twitch let me see what's what's it going on right now yeah i'm at six six thousand up i think it

266
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:34,500
just looks like that yeah it just looks like that this game is 3d yeah i know it's pretty good

267
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:49,609
thanks a lot Jeremy now i have boomer eyes if we are right trust me do you even trust me

268
01:14:50,489 --> 01:15:00,090
does anybody in this chat actually trust me do you trust me all right so if we if we were

269
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:04,090
doing an experiment where i stood behind you and you had to close your eyes and put your hands

270
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:06,970
across your chest and fall backwards and i catch you do you think i would catch you

271
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:34,300
well i would okay think about it and then i would make a decision how do i get this to go down

272
01:15:46,310 --> 01:16:11,609
oh shit chaos begets destruction sure did i get him got him too all right i'm gonna go up

273
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:20,779
right i'm gonna have to jump around nice dog safer to fall forward yeah but that's not the whole

274
01:16:20,779 --> 01:16:24,220
point of the test is to see if you trust me that i will catch you if you fall backwards

275
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,659
why would it actually be safer if you fell forward what if you didn't get caught you'd

276
01:16:29,659 --> 01:16:41,399
smash your fucking mouth on the ground it's either lose all your teeth or

277
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:57,720

foster and stuff because the more strain i put on my rib cage the worse this can get

286
01:18:39,819 --> 01:19:05,270
i'm so scared these guys they don't have very much health save it here but i'll tell you it's been a

287
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:12,439
real pain in the ass so hopefully over the next few weeks or a couple months or so

288
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:20,680
i'll start to figure out ways to alleviate it because damn is really irritating just having

289
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:26,439
like a painful all of your ribs just hurt every day like that sucks that's not cool

290
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:45,609
originally we thought it was something to do with my intestinal problems but no

291
01:19:46,569 --> 01:20:19,800
apparently not easy okay one more one more where where where where where is that good

292
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:28,619
i think so all right save it somebody fill me on him when he's talking about

293
01:20:28,619 --> 01:20:32,380
uh all right we'll go we'll break it down a little here all right so like a year ago

294
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:40,039
i started to get this weird like back pain it was on the right side of my back and it was kind of

295
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:46,420
flanking around the right side of my abdomen what's wrong obviously he went to the doctor

296
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:52,739
well i don't know and then my like stomach started to hurt my chest started to hurt too

297
01:20:52,739 --> 01:20:57,380
like my sternum so my whole abdomen and wrapping around the right side of my back

298
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,180
just fucking just was hurting all the time i couldn't do anything about it i never turned off

299
01:21:02,739 --> 01:21:07,460
it never got worse and it never got better so we did colonoscopy maybe it's something to do with

300
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:12,739
your uh colitis you have like you've had a irritable bowel disease for pretty much the last 12 years

301
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:19,699
maybe it's that nope that's doing just fine well as fine as that can be doing right all right well

302
01:21:19,699 --> 01:21:23,220
let's try this is test for this test for that test test test test test test test test test

303
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:30,420
and then i had a this is three days ago i had an upper endoscopy done with a look at my stomach

304
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:34,579
and everything and they said i you have a hernia so it's number one that might be causing it and

305
01:21:34,579 --> 01:21:39,380
then number two um i think you have this i think it's rib cage i'm like all right you think it's

306
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:44,579
my rib cage you sure give me some evidence and he said i don't i don't have any i'm not a doctor

307
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,659
we're in my garage right now

308
01:21:48,810 --> 01:22:09,979
and i went oh right right right you're larry kate the hernia is gonna fuck you up pretty bad

309
01:22:09,979 --> 01:22:16,460
hopefully the rib fucks are false alarm yeah so that just sucks because the if you have a high

310
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:25,579
over you your mind's apparently not that bad but it doesn't go away event you just have to like keep

311
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:29,420
manage it and keep an eye on it and like change your lifestyle a little bit health more healthy

312
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:35,100
eating don't eat before bed and you have to have surgery you have to have like laryngoscopic

313
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:46,020
surgery like the damn thing so it's annoying but the it's apparently it's not that serious

314
01:22:47,060 --> 01:23:07,029
it's just kind of pretty much it i feel like the i know they did it you had a hernia before and

315
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:17,130
they were fucking painful yeah it's just how do i get that but i'm not certain about i mean i'm

316
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:21,130
certain obviously they did an endoscopy you have a hernia it's like that's the clearest thing

317
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:33,529
and the rib cage thing would make sense it just would it just would oh whatever i'm just gonna

318
01:23:33,529 --> 01:23:38,890
just keep doing keep whatever keep going figure it out is manage it what do i need to do let's

319
01:23:38,890 --> 01:24:09,670
do that fine all right they feel like it sometimes give me the key creek as you breathe

320
01:24:10,869 --> 01:24:15,989
like if i lean back and i put my fingers like on my sternum and i like kind of lean back and

321
01:24:15,989 --> 01:24:24,810
pull all this i'm just kind of following me it's just like oh and i have said to random

322
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:30,649
doctors before you know if i just like could pull pick up my rib cage and like pull it apart by like

323
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:38,180
10 i feel like my whole problem would go away i've said that out loud before so it i don't know

324
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:45,079
maybe it's pressure and inflammation in the rib cage i don't know i'm not a doctor i have the key

325
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:54,489
now silver key was back here it was down or was it i remember seeing it i remember looking at it

326
01:24:55,210 --> 01:25:02,729
and the doctor goes well no no jeremy that's not that's not a good idea

327
01:25:03,289 --> 01:25:24,409
can you spawn in place i'd like to not use where are you who where the fuck are you

328
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:53,050
that's what i want to do that oh it's so precise but oh it's so got it i remember initially this

329
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:57,210
this is the okay a lot of you guys can probably relate to this i'm sure i'm sure most people can

330
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:07,289
relate to this but when this all started it's like you know when you're like certain of something

331
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:15,050
and you like this has to like i thought i thought i thought i had lime to be completely up front

332
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:20,970
which is like i read a you know test me for lime you don't have lime fuck well what is wrong with

333
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:29,529
me then i think i might have a bacterial infection check it nope you don't fuck what do you think i

334
01:26:29,529 --> 01:26:34,729
have we can test for this too maybe you have uh this uh inflammatory arthritis disease all right

335
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:59,210
do it please is this it nope what the fuck is going on it turns out my stomach is pushing up

336
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:06,020
into my diaphragm in my uh hyoidal esophageal area that's problem number one unfortunately

337
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:10,500
this surgery is the only way to get rid of it and it's mine's apparently not bad enough to have

338
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:27,579
surgery on so fuck so now what now what do you do you just have to i don't know you just have to

339
01:27:27,579 --> 01:27:30,779
keep doing whatever you're doing to try to figure out what the fuck is wrong with you

340
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:51,060
i need health that's most important the human body sucks yeah one of you is going to replace

341
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:59,770
all of my like our parts i want to go to a car mechanic for me to get like a new rib cage

342
01:28:00,729 --> 01:28:06,539
just let me lie on my back put me on one of those things that lift you all the way up into the air

343
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:17,270
at the car mechanic and just look under there and open up my back because there'll be a panel back

344
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:34,869
there and power me down and then just start replacing stuff it's gonna open here that he's

345
01:28:34,869 --> 01:28:52,789
a new engine imagine we ran imagine we ran on gasoline you just chug gasoline you went to the

346
01:28:52,789 --> 01:29:05,529
tank instead of your car you just like put your mouth in the nozzle and just like we run on food

347
01:29:05,529 --> 01:29:12,310
yeah but i mean if you had like an engine in your body you need to pull your cord like five times

348
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:26,579
to like start again how loud would the world be i'm talking like

349
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:39,800
it would be horrible that's all you'd be it would be like a swarm of bees everywhere in every single

350
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:52,729
neighborhood in every single spot gold key for this everything would stink yeah it would everything

351
01:29:52,729 --> 01:30:00,460
would be it would smell like gasoline everywhere you'd have to yeah you mute on your ear yeah you

352
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:04,220
no not mute on your ears your ears are still your ears you're just running gas

353
01:30:15,819 --> 01:30:21,140
you wouldn't be able to ever have a phone call but we wouldn't even need phone calls because

354
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:26,180
at that point you'd just be communicating through your brain i don't know like whatever facebook is

355

fucking just never stream again thank god you stopped playing the hand game that was a long

388
01:40:59,189 --> 01:41:16,819
time ago that was at least like an hour and 40 minutes ago hand simulator but remember

389
01:41:16,819 --> 01:41:23,989
this is an extra stream this week this doesn't count this is not an actual spring this is a

390
01:41:23,989 --> 01:41:45,960
fake stream because tomorrow joel and i are gonna play halo reach and then after that

391
01:41:46,760 --> 01:42:05,380
it's gonna be another co-op experience this is like the week of co-op and hand simulator i had to

392
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:13,529
look i know a lot of people are gonna say do what i said but i had to play that month i had to

393
01:42:14,409 --> 01:42:21,539
i do you know how long i've had hand simulator for in my steam inventory since 2016

394
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:38,300
i had to play it and i'm not playing that by myself you didn't have to at all nobody forced

395
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:45,180
you to play it i did i forced myself to play it once because i needed to know there's so

396
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:51,020
many talks so much talk about how fucking fun it is and how funny and cool it is i had to try it

397
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:57,100
and there was my one opportunity the secret stream that's not a stream is the perfect opportunity

398
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:16,600
for that you think i'm gonna use a real stream for that game come on come on more more more more

399
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:31,189
more where are they there's another full one here what's the other co-op game uh we're gonna try

400
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:39,899
to play the game called tools up just came out today it's local only but we're gonna try to

401
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:52,920
use that steam remote play thing we're gonna test and see if that thing works it's the plan

402
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:21,829
i want to use let's try this okay that's pretty cool but i feel like i'm wasting it anybody have

403
01:44:21,829 --> 01:44:28,359
any experience with the uh the steam remote play does it actually work it works but it could be a

404
01:44:28,359 --> 01:44:40,979
little weird no okay how so it's all right won't you get horrendous ping um i don't think so because

405
01:44:40,979 --> 01:44:51,939
it's gonna be me star and then probably talus and talus and i have the same so i don't think it'll

406
01:44:51,939 --> 01:45:10,020
be an issue a game called tools up okay uh it's like star was telling me earlier and this is i

407
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:15,619
don't know he's a he's a salty bastard isn't he look at how salty this is he said it reminds

408
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:28,840
cleanup detail but an actual video game and i was like god that's salty it's true but that's not

409
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:38,659

410
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:47,989
