1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:14,019
Hold on. I don't know what I did with my drink. My tea is the most important thing on stream.

2
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:29,879
My green tea or energy drink that I have here is my Spider-Man Iron Man suit. I- I'm sorry.

3
00:00:29,879 --> 00:01:15,260
I need it. Be right back. Peter, if you're nothing without the suit, then you're nothing at all.

4
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:25,640
Peter, if you're nothing with- without the green tea, then are you really Spider-Man?

5
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:35,379
Yeah, I still am. It's a drink. I'm fine. Shut up. It's literally green tea. I'll be- I-

6
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:50,579
I am Spider-Man. Who am I even arguing with? Yeah, people- Oh, Popeye. When Popeye breaks

7
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,260
open the spinach can, he eats the spinach. Iron Man didn't walk onto the set and go,

8
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,900
hey, Popeye, if you're nothing without the spinach, you're nothing at all.

9
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,480
No, Popeye said it's a nutritious fucking thing and I can- I'm gonna knock your lights out,

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:17,289
actually. Who are you- what is he talking about? Do you guys not know what I'm referring to?

11
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:36,300
I thought you guys watched Marvel movies. What? You don't know? I think they're doing this on

12
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:47,110
purpose. Yeah, see, I understand. Somebody does. That's from Homecoming. Yeah. Wait, is it? What

13
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:58,340
movie is that from? That's from Homecoming, right? Yeah, it is. Okay. Anyways, hi, guys. How you

14
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,020
doing? We're gonna be playing some Slime Rancher 2 today. It came out. It's in technically early

15
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:16,650
access. I liked the last one. I thought the last one was great. So why not try the other one?

16
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:27,580
How was my birthday? My birthday was great. I had a really good time. Yeah, once you get over 30,

17
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,099
your birthday just is a birthday kind of- it's not like, oh my god, we're gonna- oh,

18
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,979
wear birthday hats. And there's gonna be like a bunch of cake stuff. Well, I actually-

19
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:56,139
Holly did make me a cake. So, excuse me. That happens at 40. That was a nice day. The big

20
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:05,050
everybody needs to show up is 40. If you're invited and you don't show up to my 40th birthday,

21
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:17,850
I may have to cross you off the friends list. Because I mean, really? 40. I don't care if you

22
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:27,350
miss 31 through 39. That's 40. And I'm gonna be doing it in the McDonald's fucking place.

23
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,579
Somebody just said in pre-stream, he's gonna be really sus today, I can tell. And like, fuck,

24
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,339
I have been. I've been like saying weird shit for the first like 10 minutes.

25
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,600
Why did you know that? Why did you know that I was gonna be really sus today?

26
00:04:47,399 --> 00:05:04,250
You must- I don't know. Somebody must have had some vision or something. But yeah, 40 is when

27
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:12,759
I'll care. Every birthday from 31- okay, you freak out when you hit 30. And then it just doesn't

28
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:22,889
matter. At 31 and 32, you're kind of just, I don't really care. 40 is the next big one where

29
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,610
it's, you know, this is zero at the end. It's like, oh shit. Okay, this is another one. Another zero.

30
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:41,860
But I appreciate all the birthday wishes I saw. There's a lot of cool artwork and people saying,

31
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,180
at birthday, thank you. It surprises that many people on the internet who would

32
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:52,579
say that to some random guy who has gone on record talking about

33
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,379
putting baseballs up his ass. So, I mean, thanks. I appreciate it. I hope we can have a good time

34
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:23,050
still today. Here's to 39 more baseballs. But that's implying that I'm 39. I'm 37. You got

35
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,310
it wrong. Actually, I would much rather people think that I was older. I kind of pre-bake

36
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,110
my birthday. Does anybody else do this? Maybe you do this when you're after 30.

37
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:42,310
But I have been telling- oh, how old are you? Oh, and I'm 37. Even though I wasn't. Just because,

38
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,230
like, I need to prepare for being older. So now, maybe like six to seven months from now,

39
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,269
I'm just going to be like, yeah, I'm like, you know, I'm 38 pretty much. I'm turning 38. I'm

40
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:56,699
probably 38 soon. 38. So then when I'm actually 38, it's like, oh, I've been saying- it doesn't

41
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:04,920
matter. I'm prepared for it. I do that too, kind of. Yeah. All right, let's go. Slime Rancher 2.

42
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Welcome, everybody. I do that too. Yeah, it makes it easier. It makes it more palatable for your

43
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:32,779
brain. Just say you're 40 now and prepare for it. I don't know if I want to do that. All right,

44
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:49,540
is this game good? How is it? This game good? Yeah. I've seen a few slimes and they're cute.

45
00:07:49,540 --> 00:08:12,680
Okay, it's the same as one, but better. Okay, let's go. Tar? Oh, well, you can disable the

46
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:30,009
bad slimes. Huh. Okay, well, one time- how high can you go? One and a half times damage?

47
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:45,899
We're just- we're just playing the regular way. I'm not doing anything weird. Is there a cutscene?

48
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:52,460
After a long day of slime ranching, Beatrix Laboo was enjoying a cool glass of carrot juice as she

49
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,899
watched the sun set across the slime sea. Suddenly, a boat arrived at her dock with nothing

50
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:08,460
inside but a mysterious letter. You've explored the far, far range from the dusty shores of the

51
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,460
dry reef to the furthest reaches of the perilous glass desert. There are worlds yet uncharted,

52
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,500
Beatrix Laboo. Rainbow Island awaits you. Climb aboard if you're ready for a new adventure.

53
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:30,470
Beatrix excitedly boarded the boat and took it across the slime sea. Eventually, she saw an

54
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,950
island unlike anything on the far, far range. Mountains, trees, and grasses all in an array

55
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:43,940
of colors that danced and moved like a dream. As she explored, she found an abandoned conservatory

56
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,100
overlooking the rest of the island. Curiously, it was equipped with everything a slime rancher

57
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:57,700
like her would ever need to wrangle slime, start a farm, and build gadgets. That was- that scared

58
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:07,210
the shit out of me. And so, a new adventure begins. Beatrix tightened her boots, readied her

59
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:14,820
vac pack, and set out to explore Rainbow Island and uncover its mysteries. I don't know, it was a

60
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:32,730
loud screaming noise. How- it scared me a little. All right, sensitivity's way too high. Let's try

61
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:42,779
that. It feels a little bit better. All right, moving around. This game looks like the graphics

62
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:56,779
have increased a little. There's a lot of bloom. It looks pretty good. All right, vac pack. Yep,

63
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:05,769
suck in slimes. I remember this. Yeah, then you got to shoot them through the barrier, right?

64
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:11,000
So, is that- no, that's not it. That's not it. That's not- that's wrong.

65
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:28,259
Shoot through a cor- yeah, here we go. Then they sit here. They shit out money. Okay, so they eat

66
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:41,990
fruit, veggies, and meat, right? Cool. Okay, so then- oh, here's the marketplace, right? Just E.

67
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:49,159
Basic player controls. Okay, I think I got it. So, this game just kind of assumed that you finished

68
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:56,120
the first one and we're downloading the second one and it's like, let's go. What- let's go,

69
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:09,820
right? Like, that's it. Let's go. So, I need to feed them. What do I get the food? Don't you- don't

70
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:19,960
you plant berries and shit too? Is there a map? There is. Okay, so where am I? I think we're going

71
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:28,179
to get Elden Ringed. I think it looks like it, right? It kind of looks like it, doesn't it?

72
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:40,620
Put the cam in a different place. Okay. Oh yeah, chickens, right? Food like fruits,

73
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:52,600
veggies, or chickens. Hold on. I got it. I might be a weirdo, but does anybody else agree with me

74
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,779
that music in the background of a game? Just- I hate it. I just- I want it to be quiet and I'm a

75
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:06,470
weirdo. I've done this- um, I've tested this theory where if I turn the music off during, like,

76
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:14,629
Dark Souls or Elden Ring, I will play five times better at a boss. So, you know how the boss

77
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:25,029
musics are always like, if I turn that off, I will beat that boss fucking 100 times easier.

78
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:34,679
Okay, so I get to get food. All right, try shooting food at a pink slime. They'll eat anything.

79
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:40,039
They'll eat chickens? I thought they didn't- I thought they only ate berries.

80
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:51,879
Oh, how do I only pick up the money? When slimes eat, they make plorts. Head on over to the

81
00:13:51,879 --> 00:14:02,340
plort market and cast your pillow. Okay, depends on the game. Yeah, I really do. I- you know what,

82
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,500
it's definitely like a concentration problem or like an ADHD problem, but if I turn all the sounds

83
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:21,029
off and I just do it visually, I will- I will first try every boss in Dark Souls. Here we go.

84
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:30,580
How much money do I got? 261. Get out there and explore. So, we're just going. All right, so now

85
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:36,840
I got- how much is it to do another pen? Happy slime makes for a happy- okay, this is two-

86
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:54,980
250. I have to produce food. I gotta do a garden, right? Prove it. Prove it. I don't have Dark Souls

87
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:07,799
ready to go. I'm doing a garden. Yeah, shoot a veggie or fruit into the depositor to begin

88
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,019
growing more of that type. Yeah, this is what I want because I gotta start- that was one thing,

89
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:21,460
was food was always a huge problem. Where's my wi-fi off? All right, let's go. I'm just gonna go

90
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:28,500
straight to the front door. Install it right now. I'm not- no, I'm not gonna install Dark Souls to

91
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,049
turn all the music off and beat champion Gundyr in one minute. It's- I don't- I don't- I'm not

92
00:15:35,049 --> 00:16:01,590
gonna do that. Silent. Hold on. Just prepare it in a different window? That sounds like you want to

93
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:17,860
do it. Carrots. How many can fit in one pen? Pomegranates? Just do it. Just do it. I don't

94
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,379
have a save file that's at any boss. They would have to be the first boss of any of those games.

95
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:45,159
Slimes. Well, that's a bunny. Yep. Fog fruit. Oh, shit. Large slimes are large,

96
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:52,700
formed when slimy support- I'm like- I forgot. Right. All right, I'm going back. I'm going back.

97
00:16:53,580 --> 00:17:19,210
I'm going back. Okay, there's the garden. I'll do a big pen over here. Stay right there.

98
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:28,599
All right. Oh, it's like incinerator. Pond. Okay, right. So I want to do this. I only have 11 bucks.

99
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:36,140
Never mind. Will you just hang up over here if I feed you? All right, should I do fog fruit or-

100
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:45,109
I'm gonna do carrots. All right, yeah. Carrots. And then we'll feed you- Here you go, guys. Going in.

101
00:17:48,500 --> 00:18:12,420
They eat anything, right? Let's make some fucking money. He's gonna eat somebody. How do I suck up

102
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,339
just the money? Oh, I need to build that, don't I? I think I have to actually build it.

103
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:39,160
Okay, this is growing, right? Yep. Floor vacuum for the pen. Yeah. So what are these worth?

104
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:50,069
1.11? That's not bad. Cool. All right. The market changes too, doesn't it? On a daily basis.

105
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:06,440
I need to make a cabinet, whatever. A chickadoo? Shit, I don't have money.

106
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:51,940
What do you like that? That's what a chickadee does. And apparently that's only cute to your

107
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:59,059
girlfriend. Apparently. Apparently doing that on the couch going like, it's only cute to your

108
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:25,799
girlfriend. Okay. Oh, he's gonna be sus today. Boy, it's nighttime. You have to sleep, don't you?

109
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:38,759
You're nearly 40. So I'm 40, so therefore I cannot ever for the rest of my life

110
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:49,720
imitate a chickadee for the rest of my entire life. No, I refuse. Hey, dude, what's that bird?

111
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,440
That birds have like a pretty interesting, you know, you know that call, that bird call.

112
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,700
No, I don't. I don't. I'm 40. Oh, but you know, it's like, it's like,

113
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:03,930
how do you do it? I've heard you do it before. No, no, I'm 40. I can't make that sound.

114
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,250
Yes, it's a fucking bird sound. You're fine. No, I can't. I'm 40. I can't make sounds.

115
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:18,019
I'm going to be, I don't care. I'm going to make sounds until I'm dead. You understand that when

116
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:24,119
I'm in my death bed and there was rotten. Oh, no, it's just nighttime. When I'm lying in my

117
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,559
death bed and I'm connected to like about, you know, what it's I'm like 90 or something, like

118
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,960
a hundred and everyone's like gathered around the bed and everyone's like, oh, let's just say

119
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:44,630
goodbye to grandpa. Right. You bet your ass that I'm going to be like, you bet your fucking ass.

120
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:54,039
That's the last thing I'm leaving you with. All right. I need to make it. I need more money.

121
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:11,289
Yeah. And what they don't know, it was me making that noise. I'm all right. I got at least another

122
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:25,640
few days. Come back tomorrow. Can't make sound effects anymore. What is it? All right. So I need

123
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,759
more money. I need, when, how long does it take to grow? Probably a little while, right? I'm just,

124
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:52,089
I'm just going to go sleep. Death bed stream. You know how fucked up that would really be though?

125
00:22:52,089 --> 00:23:02,099
How are you getting out? Stop. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you.

126
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:12,059
Can you imagine if like, I, you know, I retire, whatever, and then you just don't really hear

127
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:22,299
from me at all. I fall into complete irrelevancy over the course of like 40 years. And then one day

128
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:32,309
you're a complete, you're completely grown up to, and you're like fifties or sixties or seventies

129
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:38,920
and you get a notification on whatever device you have. You're still following that. I went

130
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,559
live today and it's me lying there. It's like, I wanted to make sure I went out with everybody's

131
00:23:45,559 --> 00:24:00,740
here on Twitch. I don't know where it would be. Would you guys be there if you were like 75? All

132
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,500
right. I'll get enough money to make those then. I don't know if you would. Okay. You'd probably

133
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:11,140
look at your phone or your, you know, holographic fucking eye cameras and just be like, nah, I don't

134
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:37,740
think so. Is that too much going on? Okay. 300 bucks. I need more food. That's, you're immoral.

135
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:44,140
I mean, I'm not actually going to stream the last moments of my life in a hospital. Like why would

136
00:24:44,140 --> 00:25:05,000
I, that's, I'm not going to, when I'm like a hundred? No. Should I do a coop? I think so. Okay. I

137
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:15,579
need chickens in there. I think I have too many, right? There are too many. I need way more food.

138
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:41,380
I'll be back. Now you said immortal, not immoral. Yeah. I need way more food. Merch for your deathbed

139
00:25:41,380 --> 00:26:20,779
stream. That's fucked up. All right. I need way more food. What is this? Is it oil? Get tombstone

140
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:37,660
shirts. Ooh. Okay. Can you mark anything on the map or you just have to kind of browse around?

141
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:43,210
I'm going a little too far. Discover map data nodes across the range to uncover more of your map.

142
00:26:52,710 --> 00:27:01,079
These mushrooms. I need to upgrade. Honestly, I'm just trying to get as many carrots as I can.

143
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:16,099
And, um, get these too. You have to pay for the deathbed stream. Wait, there's a new, hold on.

144
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:30,569
Tabby slime. Oh, I remember these. Refinery. Refinery links conveniently transport resources

145
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:42,859
and ports to the, what did it say? I can send stuff from the world to the farm. That's pretty

146
00:27:42,859 --> 00:28:06,460
cool. Okay. Okay. It tells you what they like. Favorite is chickens. It doesn't really have a

147
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:24,859
favorite. Favorite is blue ice cream or something, whatever it is. Water lettuce. Interesting. What

148
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:29,660
if they banned you right before you do? Yeah. Cause I would be dying on camera, right? Then

149
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:36,599
you're going to get the, not like this disconnect thing. Can you imagine they caught it right at

150
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:58,019
like, right at like the flat line. Okay. I gotta go back. Oh, can you mark stuff on the map?

151
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:11,319
Streams is going to lag. You drop a bunch of frames. We come back from a disconnect.

152
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,980
Community Jake like walks into the frame for a minute. Hey, hey, can you die again?

153
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,890
We, we, we lost a connection. I don't know what we lost. What do you see?

154
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:36,500
All right. I got 20 carrots. I'm ready. What's that? Ooh, that's the lettuce stuff. Don't touch

155
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:50,490
that. That's mine. Um, I want to grow that probably, right? Don't touch it. Water lettuce. I

156
00:29:50,490 --> 00:30:08,230
want to grow this. This is somebody's favorite, right? Yeah. I got to grow this. Am I going the

157
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,990
right way? Yeah. This game's fun. This game is just like the other one. Okay. Here's the thing

158
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:20,019
about Slime Rancher. Starting over in Slime Rancher was always like, I don't think I really

159
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:23,220
want to do that. I think I've seen what the game is and I've seen everything I really want to do.

160
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:27,700
Would I have loved to have memory wiped myself and played Slime Rancher one again, because I

161
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:34,180
loved that initial kind of playing the port market and making money and making pens and stuff.

162
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,980
So this is, I just memory wiped and I'm playing Slime Rancher again. So this is great. I'm very,

163
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:50,170
I'm very happy. Hey, hey, sometimes people just want more and you just give them more.

164
00:30:50,730 --> 00:31:00,119
What's wrong with that? I bet you this is probably some new tools and stuff. The map's probably a

165
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:12,660
lot bigger too. It feels like it. All right. Let's go. All right. I'm back. I've got a bunch of

166
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:32,460
carrots. Um, okay. Here you go. Well, don't jump out. You know what? You just, there's, there's too

167
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:54,329
many. So, but you should eat. I want you to eat something. All right. 20. Was it worth? I went

168
00:31:54,329 --> 00:32:13,190
down. What the fuck? It was 11 bucks. Now it's 10. Okay. I can do another. I swear to God,

169
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:22,579
I thought this was Jerma in the casket. Okay. I think I've seen this before, but hold on.

170
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:35,019
Am I, does somebody edit me into this? This looks like I'm, am I edited into this picture?

171
00:32:35,019 --> 00:33:02,920
I thought this was Jerma in the casket. I swear to God, I thought this was Jerma in the casket.

172
00:33:02,920 --> 00:34:02,230
What is this? What movie is this from? No, don't vote. Hold on. It's so hard to do this.

173
00:34:42,730 --> 00:35:19,699
All right. Get this off the fucking screen. I'm still alive, but this chin is way too big. Hold on.

174
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:24,420
Oh, I'm done. It's so, you know, it's like, it's, you know, how hard it is to make the adjustments

175
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:55,079
over here and be upside down. This is my soul. Look at, we're looking into each other's souls.

176
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:14,710
No, no, no. Wait, wait, hold on. Then I wake up. I have to go back into my body.

177
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:29,900
I'm the spirit flying in like, I'm in. And now it's me. I have to go back into my body.

178
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:53,699
How big was this webcam? Jerma ghost? That is like fucked up though. It actually does look

179
00:36:53,699 --> 00:37:06,579
ridiculous. Make it mirrored. No, I'm supposed to like go fly down, right? You did this bit

180
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:13,579
three years ago. No, I didn't prove it. Hey, prove it. Don't you understand? Like,

181
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:19,500
it's a series of recycling a joke from five years ago over and over again.

182
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:32,199
You did? When? Oh, when I, I was going to say, when was I in a casket on stream doing like a

183
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:38,230
routine where I fly back into my body? It's like that never happened. Oh, okay. I know what you

184
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,710
mean. When I died on stream and I came out of the, okay. I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

185
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:47,579
I thought you meant that exact scenario right there. Okay. Yeah, I did do that. You're right.

186
00:37:48,300 --> 00:38:00,679
All right. I want, I got to make, I could take some chickens over here. Let's do another garden

187
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:05,269
because I want to grow this water lettuce because it's the bunny's favorite, right?

188
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:23,579
When was that? 2018? 2017? Because then I'm going to put these guys over here. All right. I got to

189
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:36,980
get more food. There are definitely way too many, but whatever. This is before hit and run. Yeah,

190
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:47,079
I would think so. There we go. Come here. Nice. All right. I need to put these in the pen.

191
00:38:47,079 --> 00:39:08,780
It was January, 2019. Oh, yeah. Close enough. All the viewers. This game is pretty. It is really

192
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:23,659
pretty. That's growing. I'll put the, who's is the favorite, right? Thumbnail, the thumbnail.

193
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:39,179
I don't get it. All right. I want to know. No, that's not what I want. I think I just have to,

194
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:43,880
I don't want to lose the whatever. I just got to get more food until I can grow up myself.

195
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:55,019
Let's go. Just more carrots, more fruits, more vegetables. I don't want to lose the cats though.

196
00:39:55,019 --> 00:40:21,610
Suck in your cheeks, raise eyebrows and smile at the camera. I don't get it. Can I touch my elbow?

197
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:45,349
Who cares? All right. I'm just trying. I'm just getting food. That's all I want. I don't care

198
00:40:45,349 --> 00:41:05,130
about ports right now. Just food. That's all I want. And I fold my tongue. No, I can do this.

199
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:20,599
I can't do anything. Oh no. Can you, somebody said, can you fold your tongue? And I said, no,

200
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:59,849
I don't think I thought I could. You can't. Does it work? Stop. What? He's left brain,

201
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:09,289
right brain Andy right now. What? Wouldn't that just mean a complete brain? Wouldn't that mean

202
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:18,170
that I go fine? Left brain, right brain Andy. What's it mean? You mean like one's taking control

203
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:35,510
for five seconds and the other one takes over for five seconds? Oh, they had a test in high school

204
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:40,630
saying stuff like you're left brained if you can roll your tongue and vice versa. It was dumb.

205
00:42:41,769 --> 00:43:11,750
Oh, I see. All right. Let me get some money now. American education moment. I always forget which

206
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:22,489
one is which. What's left brain is the analytical kind of mathematics one, right? And then right

207
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:42,840
brain is the more artistic, whatever it is. Reverse that. Okay. It's crazy how we have all these

208
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,570
theories and is there, is there science to back that up? Is it like, oh yeah, by the way,

209
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:53,860
that is what it is. I wonder how much that gets refined in like another hundred years.

210
00:43:56,809 --> 00:44:02,809
Like, is how we view the brain and kind of our bodies right now going to turn into how we view

211
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:10,969
people bleeding people because they had a cold? Like, oh yeah, you have the sniffles. Let's remove

212
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:15,929
half your blood. Do you think that eventually like in two, three, 400 years people are going

213
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:22,199
to look back and be like, what were they talking about? Wait, they thought they thought that they

214
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:28,119
had a left and right brain. I bet it's going to be, it's weird thinking about that. Just like,

215
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:33,460
what is going to be completely outdated science and education wise in a hundred years? Because

216
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:43,820
we are going to be that group that looks back and goes, holy shit. Yeah. Fuck in like 50 plus years.

217
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:58,409
It's possible. No, maybe not in our lifetime. Maybe like another two lifetimes. We, you're the

218
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:19,139
one that's 40 dude. That okay. I'm not that old. All right. I got 320. What's okay. It's time to

219
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:24,869
make a pen and time to feed bunnies their favorite foods, which is water lettuce. Let's do it. This

220
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:45,219
is where the money starts to actually roll here. Pretty, pretty, pretty big. Here you go. Look at

221
00:45:45,219 --> 00:46:16,300
they love it. You're 20 years older than me. Dang. All right. These are, these are worth like 20 or

222
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:49,980
30, aren't they? You guys happy? Good. Remember you're as old as my step mom. Wait, these are

223
00:46:49,980 --> 00:47:07,420
a good value. Yep. Seven. Oh hell yeah. Hell yeah. I said almost as old. Yeah. But, but how,

224
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:36,420
what do you mean? Oh, are we talking like 45? Cause that's, I'm not even close. All right. So now

225
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:51,130
I think it's time to go to sleep. How do I upgrade this stuff? Okay. Here we go. Nutrient soil

226
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,889
contains compost from the rainbow fields and minerals from Ember Valley makes crop always

227
00:47:54,889 --> 00:48:03,900
yield the maximum harvest grow twice as fast. I want that. So we're going to save up for it.

228
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:18,969
I guess they will eat anything, right? So then, so now from my understanding, if I feed a, you,

229
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:26,250
you feed a plot of a different slime to a different slime and it becomes something else. Right. So I

230
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:31,739
take this and then I feed this to one of them over here. Right. That's what, if I remember,

231
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,179
except that they, what are they doing? They're trying to escape. Okay. Well, whatever. Well,

232
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:43,190
I'm not going to do that yet. I don't think I'm prepared for that yet. So I'm going to go to bed.

233
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,150
This game, I love this game. It's just as fun as the other one. It's just more of that,

234
00:48:50,150 --> 00:49:17,300
but it's somehow new. Let's go. How's the audio? Audio good? Is the sound high enough? Low enough?

235
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:23,400
Nobody wants meat yet. So that's fine. All right. I'm going to go out and do another,

236
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:36,260
another poll. I'm just going to go out and just do another poll. You're not 40. You got plenty of

237
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:44,949
time. I know. I look, I don't care how if I'm 40. You think, are you serious? You don't think I'm

238
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:50,119
still going to, you don't think I'm still going to pull my pajama pants all the way up to below my

239
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:56,739
breasts, my leg area, my chest, whatever. And with super Mario pajama pants on and like put my hands

240
00:49:56,739 --> 00:50:04,420
down and walk around. Like, I just have legs in the house. You think I'm going to stop doing that?

241
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:11,320
My, they're like chest muscle. What am I, my breasts, my breast or area, whatever this is,

242
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:22,630
my sternum. What is it? What is this called? My under my chests. My, what? I didn't even want

243
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:32,340
to kill that thing and I just did accidentally. Pectoral muscles. Thank you. No, torso is down

244
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:43,159
here. This is chest muscles. All right. Chest, whatever. Pectorals. But anyways, my point was,

245
00:50:45,929 --> 00:51:07,559
I'm not going to just stop doing that, which I haven't gone over there this way. What about

246
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:26,010
down here? I don't think I've gone over here. Mushrooms? Me when the, oh, you didn't finish it.

247
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:39,289
What's this? Ah, all right. Hydro turret blueprint. That sounds pretty, um, pretty sick.

248
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:55,340
What was that? What just happened? That was weird. It was like a little rock that had stuff in it.

249
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:31,960
Nothing. Me when the, whatever. I wasted it. Yeah. Maybe more food. I mean, I'll just take these.

250
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,369
Why not? It's free money. Look at this. Look at all this.

251
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:50,710
Have you seen this? You can see this, right? What do they call it? Oven when you, hold on. Why do

252
00:52:50,710 --> 00:53:01,780
they call it oven when you in of out the cold food and in out hot eat the food? I don't know.

253
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:19,530
I don't know what that means. They did it wrong. Why do they call it oven when you of in the cold

254
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:29,610
food of out eat? I feel like my head hurts. What is this from Garfield? Why do they call it oven

255
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:57,829
when you of in like put in cold food? It's an edit. Okay. Hmm. I need more food. Oh, I need,

256
00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:08,969
okay. Yeah, this is, okay. You know, I'm, this is, I, no, I'm not going to say it, but like, man,

257
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:14,420
this is, this is the, this is my kind of game. This is my kind of game, especially, you know,

258
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:25,030
if I was sitting on the couch. Oh, this would be a great couch game. Just sitting on the couch.

259
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:52,360
Oh yeah. I think I'm all right now. I got 20. This puts me over the edge. Now I can do the

260
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:01,829
faster growing. Yeah, it was, it was made up. Okay. Look up Garfield, but minus Garfield.

261
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:17,610
I have way better things to do with my time than that bullshit. Okay. Like beating carrots to slimes.

262
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:51,099
The original comic is a fun comic. It makes John look crazy. I've actually seen it before and it's

263
00:55:51,099 --> 00:56:06,440
very funny. Wait, didn't somebody do like Garfield, but as like a Lovecraftian monster? There was a

264
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:23,750
lot of Garfield material. It's all, it's all very funny. It's John just saying stuff to his pet cat.

265
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:42,820
You know, uh, but isn't that kind of already fucking happening? Isn't John just kind of

266
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:48,099
talking to his cat? Is it even confirmed that Garfield can even really actually talk? Right?

267
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:57,219
Like that's already happening. Like John is just talking to nothing. That's already a thing. What's

268
00:56:57,219 --> 00:57:20,440
wrong with them all? Something wrong? Veggie diet. This is not a vegetable. Oh shit. Okay.

269
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:37,130
It's a fruit. You're right. Does anybody have their favorite example of the Garfield-less John comic?

270
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:59,190
One of the mods want to link me one? You guys want this. I'm just going to let them go. This is way

271
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:34,840
too many. Let me see this one. Oh my God. Stop moving other stuff. Why is this locked? Remember

272
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:55,699
the time yesterday when I almost ate a donut? These are fucking funny. Hold on. This one too.

273
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:24,409
Something wrong with my pants. I do this shit like every day. I like this one. Stop making toast.

274
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:38,309
But is he making the toast? What is happening in this one? What is happening in this one?

275
00:59:47,030 --> 01:00:13,510
Yeah. This one's sad. This one's really sad. Oh my God. This is so awful. I'm going to throw

276
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:22,380
myself a surprise party. Gosh. I hope I don't suspect anything. Oh man. This is just fucked

277
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:36,619
up. He looks so happy in the second picture. I don't know. Poor John. Now those are fucking

278
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:50,489
wild. What? Oh, some of these are so bad. Some of these are bad. I don't. Oh, I don't like it.

279
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:25,530
Okay. Last one and then we're done. Yeah. Those are, those are, those are fucking classic. All

280
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:38,170
right. Let's go. You have some plorts and new bucks to spare. I don't get it. What do you mean

281
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:44,150
you don't get it? He's, Garfield's supposed to be on the chair. So they edited Garfield out of the

282
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:50,070
chair and Garfield's too lazy to get out of the chair. So he just drags the chair with Garfield

283
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:55,769
in it to the vet. But you see that he's been removed. So he's just dragging a chair to the vet

284
01:01:55,769 --> 01:02:04,019
and looks, um, a little, a little weird. So you get it, right? All right. I got a lot of money.

285
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:12,599
I got to go to the lab underneath the conservatory. All right. Where is that?

286
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:31,260
I have to go in the conservatory. How do I get down there? Oh, feed them, feed them. I was too

287
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:37,619
busy looking at funny Garfield list comics. I'm sorry. This is what I'm talking about.

288
01:02:48,500 --> 01:03:04,340
What does this do? I don't want this yet. Oh, right. You have to, you can make shit. All right. Um,

289
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:18,570
I need resources. Okay. When are you going to do Garfield shorts movie night? Um, I don't know if

290
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:23,210
what conspiracy you want to believe or what you want to look into or what, what it is about

291
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:32,469
Garfield, but Garfield has stayed around. He is the test of time has shown that Garfield is now a

292
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:38,869
super meme and people think Garfield's really funny and shit. Even, even unironically, right? Or

293
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:46,329
ironically Garfield, there was the meme stuff that came over the last 10 years or so. And I don't

294
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:52,010
think any other old comic strip like that has really stuck around in the mainstream kind of

295
01:03:52,010 --> 01:04:02,889
meme world like Garfield has. I'm trying to think if there's other ones, not really Dilbert. I don't

296
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:16,340
know about Dilbert. I don't think so. The peanuts. Yeah. But the peanuts, kind of the peanuts are

297
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:22,280
sort of, they have that new show, right? On whatever it is like, like Apple TV or something.

298
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:35,690
But, but Garfield took on this next level kind of ironic humor. The peanuts don't have that.

299
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:43,699
Garfield's kind of turned into Shrek in a way. If either that, that comparison makes sense

300
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:50,789
or like Peter Griffin, like Garfield turned into like Peter Griffin with people just kind of

301
01:04:50,789 --> 01:05:11,239
put them everywhere. If just as a funny joke. All right. I got to spend some money. Shrek is Shrek.

302
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:18,280
Yeah, no, I mean, of course. I mean, Shrek is in the Library of Congress. This is one of the most

303
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,599
important films ever made. But they've, okay, they're very hungry. All right. I got it. I got it.

304
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:26,519
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh my God. What have I done? What's happening?

305
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:40,469
Oh my God. I'm sorry. How do I, what do I do? Hold on. Everybody hold on. Relax. Relax. Relax.

306
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:50,550
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. If I sneeze, then I, if I sneeze,

307
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:55,269
then I'm going to come into 500 million dollars with no strings attached at some point in the

308
01:05:55,269 --> 01:06:21,539
very near future. Okay. Not going to happen. All right. Eat, eat, eat, eat. It's in there. Come on.

309
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:32,659
All right. There we go. I was making, what do you mean? I was making a joke that if I sneezed right

310
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:36,179
there, like I thought I was going to, because it was coming, that I'm going to, if I sneeze,

311
01:06:36,179 --> 01:07:03,349
I get a million dollars, right? The non sequitur. Irma hallucinates and thinks he owns a dog. Wait,

312
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:31,510
this is pretty much what you just were looking at. I'm going to leave him here. Come on. Turn this

313
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:58,250
down. Have I ever seen this video? Is this going to be like a Toy Story scenario where like I leave

314
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,570
the room. He doesn't know that this is recording. He gets up and starts walking on fucking two legs.

315
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:06,570
I'm not the dog. This is not like dog. I'm not the dog. If you just got in here, like a minute ago,

316
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:13,670
listen, the microphone's down here right now. Listen to me. I haven't washed my hair in two days.

317
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:20,949
I've conditioned it twice. I'd haven't done that because after VR, my hair gets wicked

318
01:08:20,949 --> 01:08:25,270
fucked up and I'm afraid to wash it because I'm afraid it'll fall out. Why is, why are you,

319
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:29,689
why are you saying this? I'm going to do it today. Why are you saying this?

320
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:36,810
All right. So you're probably asking why am I doing this? No, I, yes, I am. I am asking that,

321
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:41,800
Jeremy. I fucked up the sus and the sus said there was a scream today for the last two days

322
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:50,550
and I didn't even know there was a scream that was scheduled for today until like a half an hour ago,

323
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:55,670
40 minutes ago. Oh, come on. What's this? Get up there like that. There you go. Now you look better.

324
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,029
I didn't know there was going to be a stream today, but now apparently there is.

325
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:06,550
I told you guys that anybody that was in the fake pre-stream chat that we were going to do an auto

326
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:14,069
stream. It really is John Artbuckle. This is literally going to be like 30 minutes. I'm just

327
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:18,789
doing this because I got guilt tripped by pre-stream because I, you know, this is a guilt trip stream.

328
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:28,060
Got me. Come right, go there exactly. Oh, here comes a full body reveal of the dog. Oh, no,

329
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:35,819
nevermind. Well, I know what it'll make me get up. It'll move for his favorite toy. Just you wait.

330
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:43,979
Flamingo. See? Oh dude, auto reveal. I didn't get the fuck out of the way.

331
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:51,909
What if he's just like shit on the carpet right now? Hey, don't do anything. Get daddy in trouble.

332
01:09:53,430 --> 01:10:00,380
Just like spins around and just like dumps right here. Do you see the finger? Look at the finger.

333
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:04,699
Look at the finger. Oh, hey, hey, don't do anything. Look at this weird edited shit.

334
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:18,489
Just like spins around and just like dumps. Is that a fake hand? It's going to be like a

335
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:22,890
Toy Story scenario where like I leave the room. He doesn't know that this is recording. He gets

336
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:28,010
up and starts walking on fucking two legs. Oh, no, I gotta get the dog. I'm blocking the view of the

337
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:35,880
dog. Hey, did that just join the stream? Welcome. Have we seen this? Today's a subscriber. Uh,

338
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:43,539
what day is it? Tuesday. Welcome to subscriber Wednesday. He's going to get me. He's going to

339
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:58,460
get me. I'm not the dog. This is not like dog. I'm not the dog. If you just got in here like a minute

340
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:09,930
ago. I'm just putting this in my mouth. It's not rolling around. I know. I can't seem to move.

341
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:22,789
Oh, no, please. You have to rescue me. Oh, I can't get up. Oh, no, I can't. I can't seem.

342
01:11:23,899 --> 01:11:31,899
I'm trying to do it. I, this is so sad. No, it's not sad when it was the John Arbuckle ones were sad.

343
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:52,310
This is a human, normal human behavior. Those of you that are wanting to eat that may have come out

344
01:11:52,310 --> 01:12:05,270
of my mouth. That's enough of that. That's enough of that. That's enough of that. Completely normal

345
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:16,949
behavior. All right. All right. Okay. All right. What is that? So sad. It's not sad. It's a funny

346
01:12:17,829 --> 01:12:43,029
joke. Oh my God. Look at all this cash. I can't pick up more than one slot. Really? Why not?

347
01:12:43,029 --> 01:13:14,359
Prices are going down, but I need the money. Okay. Everybody good. Everybody has been fed.

348
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:20,250
Everybody's good. Head back over here. I'll go bring you guys some carrots.

349
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:43,699
What is happening with these two? Why are they fused together? Is that, is this a new feature?

350
01:13:43,699 --> 01:14:09,000
Can they like fuse together? That's interesting. Okay. I need. All right. I got another nod. All

351
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:22,760
right. I'm going to come here. Okay. No, they weren't fused together. I'm going to get rid of

352
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:35,859
a couple because I don't, I'm running out of the ability to feed everybody. So I'm going to combine

353
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:41,859
because I don't want the pink, the pink florts anymore. We're going to do some combinations

354
01:14:41,859 --> 01:14:56,420
here. I'm going to do, uh, there. Okay. That's too many. Just go, go be free over there somewhere.

355
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:18,090
Who wants carrots? Uh, all right. Cool. You can upgrade the, uh, yeah.

356
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:33,100
Yeah. I know. I don't know how they, that's how, okay. We're going to do one more poll and then

357
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:44,949
I'm going to buy a bunch of upgrades. All right. That's the last poll. Do the chickens have to eat?

358
01:15:44,949 --> 01:15:53,989
I forget, or they just kind of exist, right? Do you have to feed the chickens? No, no. Okay.

359
01:15:53,989 --> 01:16:02,789
All right. I'm going to upgrade this pen so they, okay, they can't bounce out. That's a good thing

360
01:16:02,789 --> 01:16:15,340
to have, especially because it could be the bigger ones are going to be here. That one's pretty good.

361
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:25,899
That one's huge. Yeah. I want this one too. And then the auto feeder is, uh,

362
01:16:25,899 --> 01:16:42,819
will be coming after that. All right. Everybody in. I'm going to make them, I'm going to feed them

363
01:16:42,819 --> 01:17:01,289
these, right? And we'll make a bunch of big ones. That sounds like a good idea. What's this? Oh,

364
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:08,659
hello. Hello. I'm sorry. Beatrix, do you read me? Testing, testing. Hmm. Perhaps you're lost at sea

365
01:17:08,659 --> 01:17:13,590
taken away. Oops. Nope. Just forgot to turn on the display. Nice to see your face again, Beatrix.

366
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:18,789
I've missed you greatly, my dear friend. And while I'm quite excited for you to partake in

367
01:17:18,789 --> 01:17:23,850
a new adventure, I already have data that might complicate things. Last night I received a message

368
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:29,770
from some sort of artificial intelligence program written in code, but not one I recognize. I'm in

369
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:35,750
the process of analyzing it, but I'm certain this message was sent from where you are now. Okay.

370
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:43,640
Mysterious boat takes you to a mysterious island and is a mysterious code from a mysterious island.

371
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:52,579
Curious. Well, thanks for literally zero info. Take this home portal. It should make the early

372
01:17:52,579 --> 01:18:08,810
stages of your journey easier. That's good. And teleport back the town portal. Okay. It's time to

373
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:28,140
make big pink bunnies. Will they still like the lettuce that I'm making? I wonder. Hello. Well,

374
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:37,159
there we go. Nice. They will. Okay. So I need some, I'm going to go to bed when I wake up. The food

375
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:47,800
will probably be ready. I'm so goddamn excited. Do bunnies and cats actually probably better. I

376
01:18:47,800 --> 01:19:03,020
do. I need a place to put them though. I guess what do they eat? Could I put them in the same pen

377
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:24,500
or are they going to, is there going to be a problem? Are they eating each other? They eat.

378
01:19:24,500 --> 01:20:04,789
Okay. Happy slimes eat meat. All right. Here we go. It's going to start to get crazy in here.

379
01:20:04,789 --> 01:20:34,090
Oh, and lettuce is ready. Okay. They, I caught in Tappy Largo. All right. Veggies. They're going to

380
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:46,840
get out. I need to buy that thing. Oh no. That's bad. How do I, are there too many? Oh shit. Okay.

381
01:20:46,840 --> 01:21:17,369
Hold on. Air net. I need some money. I got to get the air net. Is this game worth it? 100%. Yes.

382
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:28,460
If you actually, honestly, if you've never played it, how much content is in the early access?

383
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:35,989
425. A lot. Okay. Is it, is it almost feature complete? Would you say it's at least 15 hours?

384
01:21:35,989 --> 01:21:48,890
All right. Well then yeah, then it 100% is worth it. I know I'm, I know I'm coming with some,

385
01:21:48,890 --> 01:22:00,090
some food. I need more chickens. All right. I'm going to go on a chicken run. Elder rooster. Okay.

386
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:20,710
Well, okay. Tappy port. What are these worth? All right. Where's the thing that collects the ports?

387
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:38,739
There it is. Okay. All right. Cool. Let's go. 28. That's worth a lot. All right. Let me get a

388
01:22:38,739 --> 01:22:53,350
roof on this. I think there's too many. Are there too many? Are there too many in here? I think so.

389
01:22:53,350 --> 01:23:12,279
Yeah. All right. I need to go and do some exploring. Oh, the carrot's not done. I need to go explore.

390
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:29,770
I've got to get some stuff. I'm going on a generic food run. I'm going to head here and then to the

391
01:23:29,770 --> 01:24:09,079
left. Food run. Has he done the beat box thing yet? I think so. Yeah. Chickens, fruits, vegetables,

392
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:28,810
everything. Anything I can get. Okay. Yep. Is this thing? I want 20 of each. I got to get ahead of,

393
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:57,130
uh, ahead of myself here. Otherwise I'm going to be in a lot of trouble. Just am. Pod decoration.

394
01:24:57,130 --> 01:25:07,829
Oh, I'm in this area now. All right. Where's one of those map pods? I have a question. So

395
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:19,270
I get a very important question. I keep getting on my YouTube homepage. Just I open up YouTube

396
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:32,779
and there it is. Gatorade pod videos. What is this? What is a Gatorade pod? You should watch it.

397
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:42,220
It's Gatorade. These little globes that people like into this container. It's not a Gatorade.

398
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:55,979
It's like a Gatorade syrup that you put into a, I guess, a travel kind of sip thing. I'm trying

399
01:25:55,979 --> 01:26:04,920
to figure out what, what the application for that is. It's a make your own Gatorade. Right. But

400
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:14,939
why not just buy a Gatorade? Is it cheaper? What is, what's, what is it? Oh, I have like the red

401
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:21,579
Gatorade syrup that I turn it upside down and like into this special device that has to puncture the

402
01:26:21,579 --> 01:26:38,100
thing. Why not just buy a red Gatorade? It's less plastic. No, it is expensive. It is. Wait, those

403
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:57,720
are good. It's a reusable bottle and you can dilute it. Maybe less plastic. One bottle in small pods.

404
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:05,529
Wouldn't like powder with like a paper kind of bad, like, you know, a paper container be better

405
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:13,220
than a plastic pod. But it just, it wouldn't be, powder would be bad or something. I mean, it's

406
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:19,539
still, I just keep seeing these videos and I'm just like, what, what is it? This is Gatorade pods?

407
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:31,210
That word. So just Kool-Aid. I mean, yeah, but just wait, does Kool-Aid have electrolytes

408
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:40,659
or is it just like food coloring and sugar? I don't think, I don't think Kool-Aid is a Gatorade.

409
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:55,079
It's, it's like yummy, delicious flavoring and sugar and food coloring. It's what less waste

410
01:27:55,079 --> 01:28:02,060
overall because it's a reusable bottle. All right. I get it. Okay. So it's a, it's a, maybe it's a way

411
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:07,800
for Gatorade to be like, Hey, look, we have all these plastic bottles and we're going to shrink

412
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:16,390
our bottles to like 10% the size and you have to turn it upside down and like, like load it.

413
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:22,619
It's, it's almost like a little, it's a little canister. It's weird. This thing eats fruit.

414
01:28:22,619 --> 01:28:41,239
Oh, no, I'll come back here versus right here. There was a specific reason why I came out here

415
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:49,939
and it was to collect 20 of each food and I'm going to stick to it. All right. I'm pretty close.

416
01:28:49,939 --> 01:29:00,100
I just need some more. I got enough chickens. That's fine. The reason he's getting it on

417
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:10,810
YouTube is there's a big marketing push for it. Should I try it? Do you want to do like a Gatorade

418
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:46,439
pod stream review? No. All right. I brought food. Oh yeah. This is going to be huge now.

419
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:52,840
Look at how much money I'm about to make. They seem to want you just to do Kool-Aid instead.

420
01:29:54,939 --> 01:29:59,029
What was the, what was the tier list that I want to do when I'm just sitting there? IRL.

421
01:29:59,909 --> 01:30:10,779
Oh, cheese. I want to do a cheese tier list because of all the goat cheese bullshit.

422
01:30:10,779 --> 01:30:25,979
All right. Can I get in there? Yeah. I want to do a cheese tier list. I talked about this with

423
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:30,619
Holly. She was like, you're going to like shit your pants. I was like, no, no, no. It's going to be

424
01:30:30,619 --> 01:30:46,300
cubes, little cubes of each one. All right. This will put me in. It's going to be a lot of money

425
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:55,449
here. This is going to be a big payday. I can upgrade this pen. This pen kind of sucks.

426
01:30:56,729 --> 01:31:04,649
I surely you probably won't shit your pants. I mean, if I do it correct, I mean, I was okay

427
01:31:04,649 --> 01:31:12,550
on the last one. I will say I felt a little odd after eating all that random shit. You need at

428
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:18,170
least two to three variants of goat cheese to get a real, I, I promise I will get real goat cheese.

429
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:23,880
I will get the good stuff. I had a big argument with the mods by the way. There was, there was a,

430
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:31,000
there was a blowout in the mod chat on the discord. I was told that my opinions were

431
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,800
absolutely fucking meaningless. That they were disgusted that I said that goat cheese tasted

432
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:43,529
like dirt and it was, it was a blowout. So I was told this specific goat cheese you need to eat.

433
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:47,210
Don't just eat the random shit from like the random restaurant that puts it on top.

434
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:54,840
So I agreed. I said, okay, I will eat a specific good one and we'll see how I feel.

435
01:31:57,210 --> 01:32:08,460
And it's got to be a blind taste test. Okay. Okay. That's fine. I'm going to know when it's

436
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:15,180
goat cheese because I'm going to want to puke when I eat it. This is not a Coke versus Pepsi

437
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:25,859
scenario. This is a Coke versus, this is a Coke versus a can of creamed corn that I have to drink.

438
01:32:25,859 --> 01:32:40,680
I'm going to tell what's wrong with creamed corn. It's just so different. And I'm so

439
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,939
get out of here. Get out of here. You're not supposed to be over here.

440
01:33:01,979 --> 01:33:17,930
You know, I actually don't, when was the last time I had creamed corn for all the people in the chat

441
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:22,569
that are calling me, yeah, what the fuck do you, you, you creamed corn, your elitist creamed corn.

442
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:27,510
I mean, when was the last time you ate creamed corn? I don't think you even could tell me.

443
01:33:30,069 --> 01:33:44,229
I couldn't. I don't. When was the last time you ate a can of creamed corn? Today. Was it good?

444
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:56,789
Never in my whole life. LMAO. Never in my life. I feel like I've had it. Okay. It's not bad. It's

445
01:33:56,789 --> 01:34:09,220
just kind of, it's a little off-putting. Cream corn is good. I don't remember the last time I

446
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:14,699
even had it. Had it been mixed in with something else, like a casserole or something, like a

447
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:21,850
Thanksgiving casserole. I don't know. One of your subs is named creamed corn. You better be nice.

448
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:27,670
I didn't say that it was bad. I just said I didn't, but I said it was kind of gross, but it is.

449
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:58,100
It tastes fine. Oh, that's good. We definitely want to make this better. Music box. Cream corn tier

450
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:03,399
list. Everyone is pinging me. Omega lul. You put creamed corn in F tier during the Thanksgiving

451
01:35:03,399 --> 01:35:26,729
tier list last stream. I did? Um, I should probably get this, right? Yeah. That's a 46

452
01:35:26,729 --> 01:35:46,899
month sub and that's the treatment you're giving a 46 month sub. Um, all right. Money's going to

453
01:35:46,899 --> 01:35:57,909
start flowing here. You guys are all right. I think I need to take care of you. Oh, you know,

454
01:35:57,909 --> 01:36:10,539
they've been fed. They've been fed. You should apologize. I mean, I'm no, no, I'm not going to.

455
01:36:10,539 --> 01:36:21,699
I don't like creamed corn. I would not eat it from a can. I would not eat it with a fan. I would

456
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:28,359
not eat it in your house. I wouldn't even eat it with a mouse. I wouldn't eat it here or there.

457
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:47,590
I wouldn't eat it with a bear. I can't rhyme any other words. I don't know. Pretend like I did,

458
01:36:47,590 --> 01:37:04,789
well, like a little bit more and then I eat it and I'm like, Oh, you wouldn't eat with a mouse.

459
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:18,739
Okay. I need more of, I think I need to separate some of these out because they're, they're,

460
01:37:18,739 --> 01:37:29,720
they're doing another pen. I'll get one ready. I would not eat it on a bus. As you know,

461
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:35,750
that would make me sus. Yeah. But you had time to come up with that. You had time to sit there and

462
01:37:35,750 --> 01:38:00,329
go. I didn't have that opportunity. Let's get some of the nighttime ones. Maybe I should go to sleep.

463
01:38:00,329 --> 01:38:09,779
All right. I'm going to go to sleep. Mods are saying that they're a good chatter.

464
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:23,609
I don't know. All right. This is really funny to me, but they're a good chatter. They've only

465
01:38:23,609 --> 01:38:31,670
been timed out. Now think about this, right? Just think about this. The mod is telling me,

466
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:35,270
no, they're a good chatter. They're good. They didn't, they're no problems. They didn't have

467
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:45,479
anything fucked up or okay. Whatever. They've only been timed out 91 times. That seems,

468
01:38:45,479 --> 01:38:55,340
that seems like kind of a lot. That just goes to show you how much you guys misbehave here.

469
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:08,409
Look at how much you guys misbehave. Most frequent chatters have over a thousand timeouts,

470
01:39:10,939 --> 01:39:21,239
over 999 plus timeouts for a, for a, a frequent chatter here. That is actually an incredible

471
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:30,340
ratio. Wow. I'm sitting here thinking, Oh, if you get, if I got time, maybe if you got time

472
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:44,149
out like twice. No, a thousand. Some of you guys have been timed out over a thousand times.

473
01:39:44,149 --> 01:40:00,739
I'm sorry. It's nightbot. Fuck the caps limit. Well, dude, if you get timed out for caps

474
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:09,060
500 times, you're going to get timed out of 501st time for a thousand times is a lot.

475
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:12,500
If I got timed out a thousand times in a chat room, I'd probably be like,

476
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:24,420
I'm probably going to get fucking banned. One of my mods has been timed out 999 plus times.

477
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:32,890
Wait, what? No, you, Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. No, let's air it out. Let's air it out.

478
01:40:33,449 --> 01:40:40,060
We've got 18 timeouts from one of the mods. Do you want me to tell you who these are?

479
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:54,279
Should I tell you who these are? Are you guys comfortable with that? Okay. Ooh. Oh,

480
01:40:54,279 --> 01:41:08,250
VR Josh. VR Josh has been timed out 34 times. Dude, one was a personal one from you.

481
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:20,069
Wait, I timed you out personally. I'm interested. All right. Grump, what's yours?

482
01:41:20,069 --> 01:41:34,380
How many times you've been timed out? Oh, wow. We currently have a leader.

483
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:43,300
We currently have a leader right now. Who's number one in regards to the timeouts here.

484
01:41:43,300 --> 01:42:01,689
Okay. Kumakisu has three, three timeouts. Grump has never been timed out ever. Once. Ever. Ever.

485
01:42:01,689 --> 01:42:22,579
In like seven years. Wow. That's actually remarkable. Wow. Not once. Unable to be timed

486
01:42:22,579 --> 01:42:32,869
out. Immune. Not fair. You can't be timed out. Giga chat. Zero. No, wouldn't the Giga

487
01:42:32,869 --> 01:42:39,289
chat be the person that's on my mod team that has like 900 timeouts, right? I feel like that

488
01:42:39,289 --> 01:42:43,449
that's Giga chat, right? Like, I don't give a shit. I've been timed out a thousand times.

489
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:51,619
So that means, yeah, that means that, uh, I'm very curious about this. This is funny.

490
01:42:51,619 --> 01:42:56,579
Is there a way? No, I don't want to do this, but this is kind of funny internally. Maybe

491
01:42:56,579 --> 01:43:01,020
is there a way for the mods to know who in chat right now has the most timeouts ever

492
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:07,300
that's here right now? Cause like, I think that's funny. Who is, who is the ultimate

493
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:22,439
timeout Andy? Do we know? We can't see more than 999. There's internal stats on Twitch. Probably.

494
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:43,270
Oh, we can't see it. We can only see 999. Ollie's been timed out 11 times, but, but a thousand.

495
01:43:44,279 --> 01:43:51,140
Those of you thousand plus Giga chats, you know what I'm saying? You've been timed out in this

496
01:43:51,140 --> 01:44:20,390
channel over 999 fucking times. Oh, here we go. This is, that's so funny. Don't, uh, don't the

497
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:27,960
glowing slimes need to be somewhere else? The only need to be kind of in the underground or something

498
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:38,260
so they're not in the sunlight. That's how it worked in the first game. Almost all of it is

499
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:48,170
nightbot. I mean, I would imagine it would be. They have solar shields for, okay. Good to know.

500
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:57,939
Thank you. Oh, you're big. Uh, let's get a few of, uh, I don't want to do any combinations yet.

501
01:44:57,939 --> 01:45:06,970
We'll get, we'll start with seven. Cool looking though. Cool looking. I think, isn't nightbot

502
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:18,500
broken right now too? Don't have a weapon to get rid of those. All right. I'm going to go, let's go

503
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:42,810
this way. Is water death? How do I get rid of these? Isn't there like a gun or something I

504
01:45:42,810 --> 01:46:12,250
can use? It's water. I don't have it yet. Okay. All right. I, what do I want to do now? What do they

505
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:17,779
eat? What do you guys eat? They eat fruits. All right. I have fruits. I need to upgrade.

506
01:46:19,449 --> 01:46:38,039
I need to upgrade my pens bad now. All right. Is that also that big guy down there? Right.

507
01:46:53,880 --> 01:47:14,340
So let's do this. What kind of plorts of these? Oh, 34. Yep. I'll take it. Oh, they can jump

508
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:35,720
right out of here. Shit. It's okay. No guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, come on. Stop 425.

509
01:47:36,359 --> 01:47:53,109
Your hairline is crooked. No, it's because this hair, look, my hairline is not crooked. It's just,

510
01:47:53,109 --> 01:48:00,810
this is falling over this way. Uh, by the way, congratulations on your 998th timeout.

511
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:20,060
Whoever said that? Why are they? Oh my God. I forgot they're in the sun. I need the sun shield

512
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:39,779
thing. That's a lot. Um, oh my God. Okay. Hold on. I got a lot of stuff going on. What are these

513
01:48:39,779 --> 01:49:03,050
worth? Only 19. That's it. I gotta feed them too. They're probably, yeah, they're hungry. 35. Damn.

514
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:14,810
All right. Hold on a second. Okay. Looking good. I need more plorts.

515
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:44,409
All right. I got money to work with now. Where are your eyebrows? I have a big brow bone and it messes

516
01:49:44,409 --> 01:50:28,180
them up. 1600 bucks. Let's go. Let's go. This needs way, this has got to go way faster. Soil.

517
01:50:29,399 --> 01:50:41,609
I'm going to have, I need fruits. So I'm going to do this too. I have two slimes that eat fruits.

518
01:50:41,609 --> 01:50:54,729
Okay. So that's good. That'll produce much faster. Let's go. All right. Uh, right. Okay. I need the

519
01:50:54,729 --> 01:51:06,300
solar shield sensitive to light and then let's make the height more too. Okay. All right. Now

520
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:15,609
you guys hopefully can't fly out. Maybe you can. Hope not. How you guys doing over here? Good.

521
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:25,930
All right. This is going, this is automatically doing it. Good. Okay. I don't think they can get

522
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:51,140
out. I think we're good. They're safe in there. Your wig is crooked. My wig? Oh, all right. We're

523
01:51:51,140 --> 01:52:05,720
going to do one more pole. One more pole because there's a bunch of, uh, ports to get. All right.

524
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:32,869
Suck it up already. Let's go. Suck it up already. Let's go this way. So they eat fruits and their,

525
01:52:32,869 --> 01:52:46,340
um, plorts are worth a lot, right? 34. I got to really start to get more of those. They're okay

526
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:56,390
in here for now. No one's having a problem. They're all fine. I don't want anything else to do. Do I

527
01:52:56,390 --> 01:53:02,970
want someone else here? No, this is, this is the best pen that I have. Yeah. So I got to keep that

528
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:14,180
in mind. Looking for a pole. No, I think I'm maybe just said something that sounded like pole. Perfect.

529
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:29,050
This is ready. So this is a vegetable. I'm going to replace this with a fruit because I have

530
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:39,060
vegetables here and these are better, higher quality. Pull all the carrots out. I need a fruit.

531
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:51,079
I'm going to go try to find like a high quality fruit. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

532
01:53:51,079 --> 01:54:19,930
It's foods in here. There you go. Yeah. Eat up. I tried to make it. All right. I'm on a mission for a

533
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:37,260
really cool, delicious fruit. Maybe backwards because I want to replace the carrots. Eat it up.

534
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:51,560
That's right. I cannot go this way. Nevermind. Because there's the pog fruit, but there's

535
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:57,859
probably something else too, right? It has to be. Qberry is probably the best thing to find in this

536
01:54:57,859 --> 01:55:15,500
area. Maybe I'll look for it. Or is it? All right. Fruits. Fruits are chickens. Eventually I'm going

537
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:27,659
to need a lot of chickens, I think. I think I'm just going to head to the unexplored area.

538
01:55:27,659 --> 01:55:39,159
That's probably the best idea. Just in case, I'm going to pick these up. There's a very real

539
01:55:39,159 --> 01:55:46,579
possibility I don't find any fruit. And if that's the case, I will punch through my monitor as hard

540
01:55:46,579 --> 01:56:09,180
as I can. Because like, I can't believe I didn't find any fruit. The people egging me on, by the

541
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:28,310
way. Come on, Quinn. I actually don't remember the last time I truly tried to break something

542
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:32,229
like that because of, I don't know. The only thing I can think of is when I used to play Super Nintendo

543
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:38,949
or some Nintendo game back when I was younger. And I told you this before, but you grip the

544
01:56:38,949 --> 01:56:42,949
controller so hard and you try to like, almost like you're tearing it in half and you're just like,

545
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:49,189
and all you hear is like, just, just components crackling inside the controller. It's just,

546
01:56:51,029 --> 01:56:55,590
you're like, all right, I'm fine. Just the crunches inside. Yeah.

547
01:56:55,590 --> 01:57:12,439
But no, I like throw in a controller or something into the screen or into the wall.

548
01:57:14,149 --> 01:57:24,260
No, my brain thinks probably five to 10 minutes ahead. A lot of times like that. And I just, if

549
01:57:24,899 --> 01:57:32,390
there's a hole in your, I have to fix that. I like the drywall is fucked up now. That's a whole

550
01:57:32,390 --> 01:57:40,310
project. That's a whole weekend project now that I'm making for myself. I have to, how do you fix

551
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:46,600
a hole in drywall YouTube video? Okay. All right. I need to go get like plaster. I need to go get

552
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:54,279
this material. I have to, I don't want to do, I don't want to do that. No. My rage is contained

553
01:57:54,279 --> 01:58:08,060
by how lazy I am to do household maintenance. Sorry. If throwing a controller onto the ground,

554
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:17,079
boom, it blows up. Pieces kind of go everywhere. I don't want to do that. I mean, I got a dog,

555
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:22,329
right? I don't want to, what if like auto is nearby or something, right?

556
01:58:22,329 --> 01:58:28,840
Oh, what if like a week later, I don't get all the pieces and I step on it. I don't, you know,

557
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:36,979
I'm not, I don't. Oh, trust me. There have been times. Oh yeah. There have been times

558
01:58:36,979 --> 01:58:39,619
when I have just been like, I want to fucking eat this.

559
01:58:39,699 --> 01:58:50,199
I want to smash this thing, but it's just, it's, it's built out of this idea that I don't want to

560
01:58:50,199 --> 01:58:56,199
do the housework that required afterwards. I, you know, maybe I should get a, like a foam controller.

561
01:58:58,569 --> 01:59:08,119
Do they make those? Do they make little like kind of squishy toy controller things for your

562
01:59:08,119 --> 01:59:15,060
controller? Cause what if you just threw that and it was just like a, a nerf controller? Yeah.

563
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:26,649
The nerf controller is real. If I went over somebody's house and instead of just two or three

564
01:59:26,649 --> 01:59:33,350
regular PlayStation five controllers, they had these foam made out of clay controllers.

565
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:38,550
And that's all they had. I'd be like, you, you, you need to work on your temper. You're like,

566
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:44,739
why do you, you own, why do you have these? I'm, I'm anticipating that that control is going to

567
01:59:44,739 --> 01:59:54,039
get thrown tonight while we're here at your house. Okay. These guys, I mean, they're, they're, they're

568
01:59:54,039 --> 02:00:03,000
at your house. Okay. These guys, I need, I, what did I do with all the fruit that I just had?

569
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:19,989
What did I do with all the fruit that I just had in my pocket? You, oh, I fed the big guy. God

570
02:00:19,989 --> 02:00:37,909
damn it. I did. Didn't I? All right. It's time. It's time to set the pink slimes free because

571
02:00:37,909 --> 02:00:50,250
they're not, the money is not worth very much. And I want to make room for the next group and

572
02:00:50,329 --> 02:00:59,100
we're going to set them free. Good luck guys. Thanks for being the start of the business.

573
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:23,060
Excellent work. Okay. Over here with your friends and there's a big patch of carrots here.

574
02:01:23,699 --> 02:01:29,060
See you guys later. Thanks for, thanks for coming to the stream guys. Appreciate it. Thanks for

575
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:48,600
hanging out. Thanks for the bits. Yep. Thank you. All right. One, a few more of these. These are

576
02:01:48,600 --> 02:02:00,380
currently the most expensive. Should I do more than 10 or 20 in one thing? I don't think so.

577
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:11,500
Although that's a big pen. I can fit a lot. Might as well. And then I have to get fruits.

578
02:02:12,699 --> 02:02:43,989
No bullshit. Fruits. There we go. Okay. Cute slime. Yeah. This is vegetable, but whatever.

579
02:02:43,989 --> 02:02:59,720
I'll take it. Um, we're already, I already got, I already got a bunch of those. Ooh, what's that?

580
02:03:00,359 --> 02:03:17,739
Fruits. There we go. Finally. Chicken. Uh, I don't need this lettuce. I'll take some more, uh,

581
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:38,229
chickens. All right. I have a ton of these. I have 20. That's probably way too much, but whatever.

582
02:03:47,430 --> 02:04:04,760
Oh, that's a little, uh, what's that? Ooh. Okay. So there's this little area over here. I think I

583
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:40,390
got to go back. Wait. Cool. Just give me, just pick up the pink florts as well. Fruit. Oh shit.

584
02:04:40,390 --> 02:05:00,899
Tons of chickens too. The right chickens. Shit. Um, I want the chickens. They're going to be so

585
02:05:00,899 --> 02:05:07,899
important. It's very soon here. Once I need to actually start getting meat, probably make a

586
02:05:07,899 --> 02:05:28,170
second pen. What's my favorite book? Um, is it a meme for me to say, um, one of the song of ice

587
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:40,630
and fire books? That's probably the last real book that I read. It's funny how that turned me off to

588
02:05:40,630 --> 02:05:48,760
reading books like forever. I've read every single song of ice and fire book. I was so into it.

589
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:52,680
And then I just like, I was like, Oh, the other book is like just never coming out.

590
02:05:53,699 --> 02:06:27,689
I'm never reading ever again. Okay. Time to go back and start building the fruit here. Of course

591
02:06:27,689 --> 02:06:52,100
it's the game of Thrones book. Show teeth so we can prove if you have cigarette stains. I don't

592
02:06:52,100 --> 02:07:28,279
think so. Your teeth are made out of plastic. All right. Let's put in. Ooh, wait. All right.

593
02:07:28,279 --> 02:07:41,770
Pog fruit going in. Is this fully upgraded? I don't think I don't want to do that. All right.

594
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:50,119
So I got fruits coming. I have a bunch of chickens now. I have too many chickens,

595
02:07:50,119 --> 02:08:03,560
so I got to be ready for this. All right. Good to go. Cool. Looks good. Let's feed you. Get some

596
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:22,779
good shit. And then what should I, should I combine the, should I make, I don't know. What

597
02:08:22,779 --> 02:08:46,260
should I combine next? I'm not, I don't think I'm going to put these, the, Ooh, nice. Okay. I think

598
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:58,390
they could fit in here for now. I'm just going to go right to bed. Okay. Now I need a music box

599
02:09:01,239 --> 02:09:10,729
and automatic feeder. All right. We're going to put a bunch of fruits in here. I think

600
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:28,359
showing your teeth is a threat. I got, I'm a dog or something.

601
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:50,060
I think you're a dog. I ain't doing it. I ain't doing it. I know the meme. I know I've read it

602
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:53,340
a thousand times. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. And then I do like a snarl

603
02:09:53,340 --> 02:10:13,130
into the camera. I refuse. I'm not doing it. All right. Come on, hurry up. New quest. What do you

604
02:10:13,130 --> 02:10:24,949
know? Beatrix Labu off on another rival adventure. Rival adventure. Why did I add a word? I don't get

605
02:10:24,949 --> 02:10:31,350
it. Why did I do that? Uh, and we'll, and didn't think to take her good pal, sometimes rival

606
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:41,420
and forever mentor. What is happening? Why did I, why did I go like this? Well,

607
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:47,260
what do you know? Beatrix Labu off on another rival adventure. Why did I go like this?

608
02:10:49,529 --> 02:10:55,819
That was weird. Okay. Seriously. Next time you go off running off to dangerous uncharted territory,

609
02:10:55,819 --> 02:11:01,880
could you at least give me a heads up? Okay. Help collect all those valuable resources that

610
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:07,340
seem to be scattered all over the island. Why you think I wasn't going to do a little recon

611
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:20,069
of my own? What good are surveillance statistics if they can't snoop on stuff? Why am I making

612
02:11:20,069 --> 02:11:26,789
words up? Anyway, be careful out there. The island gives me a kind of weird vibe,

613
02:11:26,789 --> 02:11:33,989
so I'm going to keep poking around. This is why I don't read. I, I have been waiting for

614
02:11:34,789 --> 02:11:40,170
the winds of winter for 10 years. I stopped reading books and I've lost the ability to

615
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:48,260
comprehend reading. Okay. Since I know you're starting from scratch out there, take this

616
02:11:48,260 --> 02:12:00,760
refinery link. Should you make things easier for you? I'll just, bro, I gotta be honest.

617
02:12:01,859 --> 02:12:05,460
The only reading I've done is just reading the back of cereal boxes when I'm bored

618
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:09,850
eating cereal in the morning. You know what I mean? That's the only reading I've done.

619
02:12:09,850 --> 02:12:15,369
It's just the what's on the back of the cocoa puffs box. Oh, it's another maze. By the way,

620
02:12:15,369 --> 02:12:20,100
let me design those. Let me design those fucking things. Have you noticed that those have gotten

621
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:30,039
worse? Those, the back of the cereal box activity things have gotten worse. It's just an easy shitty

622
02:12:30,039 --> 02:12:35,560
maze now. There used to be so much cool shit. There'd be a word search. There'd be a maze over

623
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:41,029
here. There'd be find the 10 leprechauns. What happened? There's just, there's don't,

624
02:12:41,029 --> 02:12:59,220
they don't want to do that anymore. Oh, here's a mad lib. Those are for children. Yes. And I'm

625
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:07,319
saying they're not, they're not there anymore. No, I'm sorry. They're for children. And they're

626
02:13:07,319 --> 02:13:11,979
also for adults in a bathrobe at two o'clock in the morning eating Honey Nut Cheerios out of a

627
02:13:11,979 --> 02:13:16,279
fucking bowl because you're hungry at two o'clock in the morning. And I'm sorry. Who am I going to

628
02:13:16,279 --> 02:13:24,869
talk to at 2 a.m.? What am I going to do at 2 a.m.? That is the box is facing me and it's, I don't

629
02:13:24,869 --> 02:13:31,340
know, a little dark outside. Is nobody really around? It's just, it's me in the box. It's just

630
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:39,380
me in the box. So I'm sorry. Yes. I read the little activity thing on the back of if it's like 3 a.m.

631
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:57,619
and I'm eating Honey Nut Cheerios in a bathrobe. Oh, here we go. Don't act like you don't pick up

632
02:13:57,619 --> 02:14:04,600
random shit to read in the bathroom. I'm not saying they do that with the Honey Nut Cheerios box,

633
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:20,949
but you know what? It's the same. It's in the same space. It sits in the same spot. It's just,

634
02:14:20,949 --> 02:14:25,909
it doesn't, it's just shit that doesn't even matter that you're just passing time with two minutes.

635
02:14:54,939 --> 02:15:00,619
Somebody said, dude, you realize the toilet bowl is not for the cereal, right? Like I'm

636
02:15:00,619 --> 02:15:16,890
I'm putting the cereal into the toilet bowl and Captain Crunch still has puzzles on it.

637
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:22,470
He did it with coffee recently while I was asleep. I'm horrified. He talked about it on stream and

638
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:25,909
I learned about it hours later. Well, we talked about when I drank the espresso while I was taking

639
02:15:25,909 --> 02:15:35,430
a shit. That was a little unhinged. I will agree. I felt like it. I felt, I don't care. I felt like

640
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:45,850
doing it. That's it. I felt like I just felt like it. That's it. That's all. I don't need to explain.

641
02:15:45,850 --> 02:15:50,500
There's no explanation. It actually is not an explanation. People are like, dude, why,

642
02:15:50,500 --> 02:16:01,979
why did you do that? There is none. There's nothing to explain. It's just, I felt like it

643
02:16:01,979 --> 02:16:11,180
one day. I was like, I'm going to do this today. That's it. And it was, it was like, whatever.

644
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:19,210
It wasn't a big deal. It was, it actually wasn't a big deal. Okay. Let me explain. For those of you

645
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:24,729
that don't know or weren't here or whatever. I don't know. Like, like three years ago, whatever

646
02:16:24,729 --> 02:16:31,779
it was, it was like, I don't know, like a few months ago, I was late to a stream and I like to

647
02:16:31,779 --> 02:16:38,649
have a coffee before the stream. And I made an espresso. The espresso was just a little,

648
02:16:38,649 --> 02:16:45,700
it's just a little thing. It's not even two ounces of liquid. So that's a lot of money, by the way.

649
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:53,290
So I make an espresso. I'm already like five to 10 minutes, probably late to the stream. So I'm just

650
02:16:53,290 --> 02:17:00,360
like, okay, usually it's you drink the coffee and then, okay, I need, I don't really need to go

651
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:12,020
this far. Coffee is a, it's a diuretic. I, coffee in the morning gets me moving. Right? So I was

652
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:17,879
like, you know what? Like, I'm, I'm late to the stream already. I'm just, I'm just going to bring

653
02:17:17,879 --> 02:17:22,040
this into the bathroom. Like, what the fuck do I care? It's one and a half ounces of liquid. I

654
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:30,809
didn't even care. And I sat there and was just sipping on an espresso while I was, you know,

655
02:17:31,370 --> 02:17:41,379
getting prepared to what? That's not, is that really that weird? And I remember sitting there

656
02:17:41,379 --> 02:17:55,979
going like, all right, I've only, that's only, I've done it once. I haven't done that ever again.

657
02:17:55,979 --> 02:18:18,309
How are we doing over here? Good. It doesn't matter. That's kind of a weird vibe. I, I disagree.

658
02:18:18,870 --> 02:18:25,510
It was something that I just did one time and I was like, you know what? Fuck it. I'm going to

659
02:18:25,510 --> 02:18:32,219
do this once because I feel like it. And I will tell you, it was, it was not a negative experience.

660
02:18:32,219 --> 02:18:36,219
It was not, I don't want to say it was a positive experience, but there was nothing. I got through

661
02:18:36,219 --> 02:18:41,879
the coffee and I was done and I was ready to go. And I, I skipped like 10 straight minutes of like

662
02:18:41,879 --> 02:18:53,260
sipping a coffee before the stream. All right. Let me go upgrade something. It wasn't only one

663
02:18:53,260 --> 02:19:14,790
time. It was the only one time. That's it. Oh, I need ore. Okay. 10 of these. I feel like I need

664
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:38,870
this. All right. This is for any 10 of the funny lords. Okay. Okay. Let's do that. And I will load

665
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:48,420
this up momentarily. How are you guys doing? You all right? I think I need to make this go faster.

666
02:19:50,790 --> 02:20:01,540
Yeah. People hungry in there. How are you? Let's do increase soil, faster growth. Looks good. Are

667
02:20:01,540 --> 02:20:17,989
you at the age where you have a magazine rack in the bathroom yet? Um, no, I think I have to do

668
02:20:17,989 --> 02:20:38,170
another. Yeah. I need more food. I just do. This is vegetables. I need root or yes. Okay. Did you

669
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:43,049
eat a three course meal on the crapper? I have not heard anybody say crapper in a long time. That's

670
02:20:43,049 --> 02:20:54,680
impressive. Um, well, no, that's not true, but whatever. All right. I'm going to get this one.

671
02:20:54,680 --> 02:21:11,379
Should I just put vegetable in there now? I'll be back. Um, I gotta get off this island. I feel like

672
02:21:11,379 --> 02:21:18,139
I've seen a lot of the, uh, feel like I gotta go up here or this way because I've gotten a lot,

673
02:21:18,139 --> 02:21:25,430
most pretty much everything off here. Are there any other slimes that are here? I need 10 of

674
02:21:25,430 --> 02:21:56,040
these. I need 10 ports, 10 of the bunny ports. I need that. Okay. I need 10 of these. Come on.

675
02:21:56,040 --> 02:22:21,479
Three or somebody else eat something. I missed a lucky slime. What does that mean? I've, if you

676
02:22:21,479 --> 02:22:49,829
eat the veggies, they need them. That's it. One more. Where is it? When do you just please? All

677
02:22:49,829 --> 02:23:15,579
right. 10. Good. I can now upgrade the vacuum cleaner. We're going to blink for like an hour.

678
02:23:15,579 --> 02:23:18,780
I'm going to just do another, I'm going to do another pog fruit tree. I think it makes the

679
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:30,819
most sense. Oh shit. Look at this. Why was this one so fertilized or whatever? That's a lot.

680
02:23:30,819 --> 02:24:01,379
Okay. 19. I guess I could feed this, right? Isn't there one down there? Anything else over here?

681
02:24:01,379 --> 02:24:06,299
All right. This is the only area I've not been. So let's just take a quick look.

682
02:24:06,299 --> 02:24:27,100
Hmm. Nothing over here. Actually there was, it was a hen.

683
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:55,659
I think that's good. Although I'd like a, I think that's good. I'll get the upgrade for the

684
02:24:55,659 --> 02:25:12,219
vacuum cleaner. Ooh, what's that? You need to take a cold shower chat. Is there any data?

685
02:25:12,219 --> 02:25:19,780
Isn't there science behind that? Taking a, like finishing your shower with like it not being hot,

686
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:32,139
hot, hot is actually not a bad thing. Can you play trombone champ? I actually, I'll play trombone

687
02:25:32,139 --> 02:25:42,260
champ probably maybe tomorrow. Cause I want to do breath of the wild tomorrow. Is trombone

688
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:52,120
champ on the switch or is it a steam game? Yeah. I'll do breath of the wild and trombone champ.

689
02:25:52,120 --> 02:26:05,719
Is it on switch? Steam. Okay. The, this has got to get an upgrade. Yeah. I got to feed the chickens

690
02:26:05,719 --> 02:26:20,299
and shit. Okay. I need to feed. You guys are good. Holy shit. That's a lot. All right. You need food.

691
02:26:20,299 --> 02:26:38,120
All right. That's good to go. Suck this up. It's just on steam. All right. Oh fuck. I already have

692
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:54,250
a lot of those. Probably have two grand after this. What's the price? The price, I'm going to go to bed.

693
02:26:54,250 --> 02:27:00,760
Maybe the price will increase tomorrow. What about splatoon? I did want to play splatoon eventually.

694
02:27:09,770 --> 02:27:29,850
No price change, whatever. All right. Sucking these up, right? Remind me to keep 10 of these.

695
02:27:29,850 --> 02:27:36,500
Otherwise I will forget. I got this 10 in the, in the chamber thing here. Okay.

696
02:27:49,590 --> 02:28:02,139
15. Okay. All right. Now pretty good payday coming out here.

697
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:15,770
Very nice. Okay. What are these worth? Like 30? These were 30 yesterday. Whatever.

698
02:28:20,940 --> 02:28:49,129
I need whatever that is. He doesn't understand economics.

699
02:28:51,260 --> 02:29:04,709
I know I'm flooding the market. I know. Okay. Cotton port. Oh, I have to shoot them into here.

700
02:29:04,709 --> 02:29:21,700
Right. How do I do that? There we go. All right. So I can, now I can get resources from a node.

701
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:35,799
Shakes loose science resources from nodes in the environment. What does that mean? What does that

702
02:29:35,799 --> 02:30:03,159
mean? A node? Well, I know a node when I see one. Yeah. Okay. Still have money. Hmm. The water

703
02:30:03,159 --> 02:30:16,809
sprouts. Oh, okay. Cool. So I can actually use those now. That's pretty sick. What's down here?

704
02:30:16,809 --> 02:30:37,110
Oh, it's just behind everything. Okay. All right. Time to upgrade. How much is it to go the, the

705
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:47,909
area over here? I want to go over here or down here. Let's see. I think it's like a thousand,

706
02:30:47,909 --> 02:31:08,020
2000, 1800 for the den. Oh, okay. That's the place to put the, where the light doesn't get

707
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:26,010
in there. The archway, ancient ruins. Okay. How are we doing? No more ports, but I definitely

708
02:31:26,010 --> 02:31:32,549
have an, I definitely have to play. Let's restock the food. This is going to get bad if I don't.

709
02:31:33,350 --> 02:31:55,610
Oh my goodness. There's so many chickens in here. Um, what, what am I supposed to do? Feed

710
02:31:56,569 --> 02:32:38,709
Vitamizer? There's a lot. All right. Feed, feed, feed, feed growing. Okay. Right here. All right.

711
02:32:38,709 --> 02:32:46,520
Good. Go. Okay. There's way too many chickens, but I need somebody, something that eats meat.

712
02:32:48,059 --> 02:33:03,829
They eat meat, but do I really? I don't know. Okay. It's time to, where should I go? Is this

713
02:33:03,829 --> 02:33:18,459
boat? Can I use this boat? Let's check it out. Wake up, dude. I'm awake. The boat costs money.

714
02:33:18,459 --> 02:33:32,889
I don't think I can activate the boat. I did get that node thing though. Let's check that out.

715
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:48,649
Why are you angry? What? I'm not angry. Why do you think I'm angry? Why is everyone saying wake up?

716
02:33:48,649 --> 02:34:14,229
I'm looking for one of those oil nodes. Another one down here. Oh, wait a minute. I see one right

717
02:34:14,229 --> 02:34:44,870
here. All right. Give me something new. Jelly stone. Ooh. Okay. Jelly stone. This is box.

718
02:34:44,870 --> 02:35:02,840
Wouldn't, this is another one of those somewhere over here, isn't there? Veggies. Oh, okay. Here,

719
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:23,590
look. Eat these. That's a veggie, right? Oh, I got it. Okay. That's the cube one. That's when

720
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:33,659
everyone's like, you got to find that one. I got a cube berry. All right. I got to make sure I grow

721
02:35:33,659 --> 02:36:03,770
this. I don't want to forget something. I'm thinking I'm just going to go back. Cue berry,

722
02:36:03,770 --> 02:36:11,100
resident sleeper. Cue berry. Chat's on something today. To be fair, the entire stream feels like

723
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:40,229
we all shared a joint. Does it? So is this, is this a food? This jelly stone? What does it do?

724
02:36:40,229 --> 02:36:55,579
Is it just like a, is it a buff or something? Oh, here we go. Don't touch those. Those are mine.

725
02:37:00,709 --> 02:37:13,989
Deep brine. Not safe for drinking. Water from a slime sea that's been filtered by the subterranean

726
02:37:13,989 --> 02:37:23,159
core below Rainbow Island. It's denser than freshwater and loaded with salt. Okay. What do

727
02:37:23,159 --> 02:37:57,219
I do with it? Bong water. Nothing else over here. Oh, yeah, there is. I remember there was one in

728
02:37:57,219 --> 02:38:04,520
the cave somewhere, right? Yeah. All right. I got a couple of new resources. What the hell do I do

729
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:20,579
with this shit? How hard is the jet pack to get? I don't know. Let me go look. I'll make some money

730
02:38:20,579 --> 02:38:37,719
here. Put it in the refinery. Yeah. That's a good idea. All right. You are fine, but you...

731
02:38:41,659 --> 02:38:51,079
Where's my second tree over here? I really hate to do this, but I have to delete this.

732
02:38:52,940 --> 02:39:24,620
No, no, no, no, no, no. This one's not upgraded. I'll do to this one. There we go. All right. Let's

733
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:32,579
collect some cash. Cause I've got a lot of florts now. Yeah. I'm going to have this again. I'll be,

734
02:39:32,579 --> 02:39:39,180
I'm going to have, I'm going to end up with like three grand. Oh yeah. You better believe it. Look

735
02:39:39,180 --> 02:40:27,159
at this. I'm going to have like two grand or at least look at this. All right. It's time to

736
02:40:27,159 --> 02:40:51,079
collect this pen. I need a new group of slimes. All right. Refinery. Okay. I've got jelly stones

737
02:40:51,079 --> 02:41:02,489
in here now. So what's the, how do I get the jet pack? Jet pack is one, 10 radiant ore,

738
02:41:02,489 --> 02:41:18,549
10 phosphor plorts. What's that? I can get those. Where do you get the radiant ore? Check caves.

739
02:41:18,549 --> 02:41:28,389
All right. Let's do a collection here.

740
02:41:57,030 --> 02:42:06,170
Okay. I wonder if I should upgrade people now. Like I should people, what's with my voice?

741
02:42:07,209 --> 02:42:39,270
Should I combine the, the ghosts with the pink or something? Experiments.

742
02:42:39,750 --> 02:43:12,280
There's food in the dispenser. I think it's garbage though. It is. Okay. I got a lot of money

743
02:43:13,180 --> 02:43:16,620
and I do anything else with these. I think these are all fully upgraded, right?

744
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:21,350
Yep. This is fully upgraded. This is fully upgraded. It does have to,

745
02:43:21,350 --> 02:43:29,690
I don't think I need that though. This, this is fully, wait no it's not. Safely and gently

746
02:43:29,690 --> 02:43:33,370
moves elder chickens away from the younger generations and stores them in a collector.

747
02:43:35,989 --> 02:43:52,860
Um, should I just do that? I feel like they're all getting old. There was only one elder chicken

748
02:43:52,860 --> 02:44:19,989
in this whole coop. That was 1300 bucks. Okay. Well, this is good. All right. I'm going to,

749
02:44:19,989 --> 02:44:59,139
where do I go? Where should I go? Southwest and down here. Cubes. So now we are going to do this.

750
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:24,649
Uh, yeah. Get rid of this shit. I just want double cubes. I have to start feeding

751
02:45:24,649 --> 02:45:28,329
chickens to somebody because that this is getting ridiculous.

752
02:45:43,450 --> 02:46:04,170
They eat meat, right? I think so, right? Veggies and meat. I'm just scared that I'm going to find

753
02:46:04,170 --> 02:46:21,159
a slime that only eats meat and I'm going to waste all these. Is that wrong to think that?

754
02:46:21,159 --> 02:46:26,360
All right. I need a, I need a new slime. I got this pen over here. I'm not,

755
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:35,049
just not being used for anything. What are you doing over here? Oh, you're just hungry.

756
02:46:35,049 --> 02:46:43,780
Oh, okay. Well here, that's a special cube. That's cube fruit. That's just for you.

757
02:46:47,049 --> 02:46:56,629
There you go. All right. Speaking of cube fruit, I should probably store this

758
02:46:57,989 --> 02:47:14,139
or feed it to these guys over here. Yeah. All right. I'm going to the Southwest. Special dork fruit.

759
02:47:19,299 --> 02:47:32,729
All right. Let's move. There's too many tabby slimes. I cracked the super mysterious code

760
02:47:32,809 --> 02:47:38,309
that was sent to me. It was complex. I believe that AI, I believe that the AI that created

761
02:47:38,309 --> 02:47:44,229
this code displays a comparable intellect to my own. So very advanced, almost alien.

762
02:47:44,229 --> 02:48:09,000
What did it say? Okay. Hello. Who's this? Hold up, Beatrix. Are you there? It's me, Ogden Ortiz.

763
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:12,489
Are you off on a big new adventure on a mysterious island filled with secrets and danger and maybe

764
02:48:12,489 --> 02:48:17,059
a few succulent fruits and veggies the world has never seen before? You know, I had to ask.

765
02:48:17,620 --> 02:48:22,329
Ever since you got me a steady supply of Cucadoba fruits, I've been reaching for

766
02:48:22,329 --> 02:48:31,299
even greater culinary heights, getting pretty tired of eating Cucadoba pie, Cucadoba souffle,

767
02:48:31,299 --> 02:48:39,959
Cucadoba pudding, Cucadoba corn, carne, Cucadoba corn. You get the idea. I'm running out of ideas

768
02:48:39,959 --> 02:48:53,829
and willpower. If you see something new, please tell me about it. Okay. Okay. Oh, I got this.

769
02:48:53,829 --> 02:49:10,840
Finally. How do I turn that on? How do I use the water? Do I have to suck water up first?

770
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:32,950
Is that other tree upgraded all the way? No, it's not. This is democracy manifest. Oh,

771
02:49:32,950 --> 02:49:42,489
that's a nice chokehold, sir. It's one of my favorite videos of all time. I mean,

772
02:49:42,489 --> 02:49:56,899
it's a classic video. All right. It's in Southwest. I'm heading Southwest. A meal?

773
02:49:57,459 --> 02:50:29,219
A succulent Chinese meal? Hot on. Farewell. Get your hands. What an outrageous video. Show it and

774
02:50:29,219 --> 02:50:48,489
dump it. I can't. I don't, I don't think I can. I don't know. I don't know what word for word

775
02:50:51,219 --> 02:51:10,969
fry. Um, I'll try. Is the charge eating? Can I have subtitles? It's going to be hard for me to do this.

776
02:51:10,969 --> 02:51:34,709
Let me turn on subtitles. Okay. I'm going to, uh, let me see how this works. What is the charge?

777
02:51:34,709 --> 02:51:40,870
Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal? Okay. Let me try this. I got to turn him off though.

778
02:51:40,870 --> 02:51:55,770
All right. So this has been muted. Okay. I'm going to try. What is the charge eating a meal?

779
02:51:55,770 --> 02:52:09,239
A succulent Chinese meal? What is this? This is not the video. Hold on. Wait, this is the wrong

780
02:52:09,239 --> 02:52:33,030
video. Just skip to 15 seconds. Okay. I'm under what? Okay. Gentlemen, this is democracy

781
02:52:33,030 --> 02:52:40,540
manifest. What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal? Democracy manifest.

782
02:52:41,979 --> 02:52:49,940
I need, this is the wrong video. Give me the right video. He keeps cutting around. This is like the

783
02:52:49,940 --> 02:53:11,850
news report of the guy. This is the news report. Okay. I'll do this one. Hold on. Let me do it again.

784
02:53:14,090 --> 02:53:26,870
Okay. Let's put this one on. I'm ready. I have to really prepare for this.

785
02:53:28,659 --> 02:54:10,780
Okay. Are we ready? Are we ready? Okay. Let's go. No, you don't want, we don't want audio for you.

786
02:54:10,780 --> 02:54:30,020
This is, this is not even right. What? Hold on. I'm not showing any under rest. I'm, what? Gentlemen,

787
02:54:30,020 --> 02:54:39,159
this is tab, tabock receive manifest. Ever look at the headlock here. See that chap over there

788
02:54:39,159 --> 02:55:05,159
joined. Oh my piousness. This bloke who got me on. Chinese male. Eating a meal? Eating succulent

789
02:55:05,159 --> 02:55:20,010
Chinese male. Succulent Chinese male. Oh, that's a nice headlock, sir. I see that you know that

790
02:55:20,010 --> 02:55:34,219
you're cute. Alright, let me try this. I'll give it a go. Here we go. Just a short breather. I could

791
02:55:34,219 --> 02:55:48,780
speak showing anything under arrest. I'm under water. Gentlemen, this is tobacco receive manifest.

792
02:55:48,780 --> 02:55:55,979
Ever look at that headlock there. See that chap over there joined or by piousness is the bloke

793
02:55:55,979 --> 02:56:05,450
who got me on the penis before. Well, what reason? What is the charge? Eating on the older succulent

794
02:56:05,450 --> 02:56:15,909
Chinese male. Oh, that's a nice headlock there. Stop. I see that you know you're cute over here.

795
02:56:15,909 --> 02:56:45,430
Wood and user. Are you waiting to receive my? I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't do it. I can't do it.

796
02:56:45,430 --> 02:57:06,170
What the fuck? What the fuck? I can't, dude. I can't. I gotta go back to play the slime game.

797
02:57:20,979 --> 02:57:27,139
That's in the video. I did not. I forgot that was in the video. I thought that was a wrong

798
02:57:27,139 --> 02:57:34,870
caption. I forgot that he says that. It's like, holy shit, dude. What? I forgot that was actually

799
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:56,489
in the video. OK, we're going to go down to the southwest. Did he beat champion gundyr already?

800
02:57:58,870 --> 02:58:34,520
Yes, I did. It was very easy. Is this a cube tree? Oh, the cash in there. All right, I'm down in the

801
02:58:34,520 --> 02:58:40,819
southwest. What am I looking for? I have to open up one of those other places, right? I gotta,

802
02:58:40,819 --> 02:58:52,629
I gotta hurry up. I got, I got money coming in. Bring the mustache back. I can't, I can't do it.

803
02:58:53,190 --> 02:59:10,709
Is there an audio delay? There shouldn't be. Is it one of the other? I feel like I have to go into

804
02:59:10,709 --> 02:59:20,180
this or something, right? This is what, like two grand? 1800? Can you do the ooh, ooh, voice? I've

805
02:59:20,180 --> 02:59:28,889
been waiting a long time. No, I promised I would never do it again. If there's a reason to do it,

806
02:59:28,889 --> 02:59:38,090
maybe I would. I kind of don't know where to go. I could feed the big guy. I could try to go this

807
02:59:38,090 --> 02:59:47,459
way. Let me, let me look at what's over here. I feel like that's where I need to go. Wait,

808
02:59:47,459 --> 02:59:58,309
there's a voice desync? No, there shouldn't be. No, there really shouldn't be. I turned all that

809
02:59:58,309 --> 03:00:17,670
off. The webcam is late. Oh, it really shouldn't be. It's probably because of the low FPS on this

810
03:00:17,670 --> 03:00:28,899
piece of shit. Yeah, this thing's a piece of crap. Actually, this thing's a piece of crap. But I'm

811
03:00:28,899 --> 03:00:35,620
one of those people that complains about a product and, and never stops using the product. I just

812
03:00:35,620 --> 03:00:58,569
complain about it every day. Have I gone up there? I haven't, I need the jet pack. Seems fine now.

813
03:00:58,569 --> 03:01:06,969
That's weird. All right. I'm going to head over here because I feel like this is where I need to

814
03:01:06,969 --> 03:01:23,239
go. I need to activate the boat or something. Because if I go this way, what, what, how much

815
03:01:23,239 --> 03:01:36,809
is this? All right. 1800 bucks. All right, let's go. I can make that right now. I guarantee you,

816
03:01:36,809 --> 03:01:51,530
I can make that right now. I, okay. I need to get rid of at least a third of these chickens.

817
03:01:51,530 --> 03:02:29,049
I see you know your judo well. Where's my, uh, cabbage farm? Like the cabbages aren't even

818
03:02:29,049 --> 03:02:59,899
ready. How is that possible? All right. Here we go. How can, how can it, is it possible that

819
03:02:59,899 --> 03:03:29,399
there's no cabbage right now? Oh man. Okay. Yeah. I definitely can afford it now. What the fuck is

820
03:03:29,399 --> 03:03:55,620
that? This is an AI prompt photo for a German enjoying a succulent Chinese meal at a,

821
03:03:55,620 --> 03:04:02,649
German 95 enjoying a succulent Chinese meal in an upscale restaurant. Oh, I see. They fed the face

822
03:04:02,649 --> 03:04:14,600
into the, it didn't generate the face. I was going to say this is weird. Let me, I gotta say,

823
03:04:14,600 --> 03:04:35,190
this is weird. Yeah. I want you to, yeah, I'll show you. This is creepy. I thought it made my face.

824
03:04:48,729 --> 03:04:53,370
Why am I putting it into my, what's happening to my hair? Why am I putting it in my ears?

825
03:04:53,370 --> 03:05:15,290
Why am I putting, why am I going into my ears? These look like Tinder profile pictures. It

826
03:05:15,290 --> 03:05:32,100
really does. Oh, I'm on vacation. What the fuck? Why do I look so weird? Why do I look so strange?

827
03:05:32,100 --> 03:06:06,940
What is this from? This image right here. This is a toothbrush or whatever. AI is fucked, man.

828
03:06:06,940 --> 03:06:32,180
It really is. The prompt for this apparently was, what the fuck is this? German 95 enjoying succulent

829
03:06:32,180 --> 03:06:40,010
Chinese mayonnaise at home in his kitchen. Why do I have sunglasses on my head? What is this one?

830
03:06:44,219 --> 03:06:59,000
What is going on in this image? Can somebody help me with this? They said Reddit shelf,

831
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:20,059
me with my Reddit shelf. It's so funny. Why, why am I so skinny? It can't do text. It's just you in

832
03:07:20,059 --> 03:07:34,170
the Reddit shelf. But what's even on here? Why is there a sink? There is a sink on the Reddit shelf.

833
03:07:34,170 --> 03:07:45,110
Look at this right here, right in the middle. What else is even on here? A toilet, an empty toilet

834
03:07:45,110 --> 03:07:54,040
paper roll, a bunch of Funko pops, some weird Funko pops. These like backpacks, a bathroom sink,

835
03:07:54,040 --> 03:08:12,360
a toilet. What else is it in this room? What is this? What's the shirt? I think that's a whee behind

836
03:08:12,360 --> 03:08:36,149
me. RIR rims. JC Mr. JC. What is this? Dude, AI is so fucking weird. This shit is, this shit is

837
03:08:36,149 --> 03:09:07,180
fucked up. It really is. What's on the ground? Unbelievable. Jesus. Okay. All right. There's tons

838
03:09:07,180 --> 03:09:17,940
of money now and I'm going to open up that of the door. I, okay. The chickens are, this is better.

839
03:09:24,059 --> 03:09:40,920
Okay. So this is good. That looks good. Looks good. Forty six. I need to hold more

840
03:09:40,920 --> 03:10:16,229
plorts. I, how do I upgrade my plort holding ability? These are going down in price. Two grand

841
03:10:16,229 --> 03:10:29,270
probably. I should be able to open it. Would you ever play super monkey ball? Um, I did. I beat it

842
03:10:29,270 --> 03:10:34,969
already. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that was a melt downstream, right? I had, I had a lot of

843
03:10:34,969 --> 03:10:47,979
problems with that game. Oh yeah. No, I, that was a, that was kind of a nightmare. I did not expect

844
03:10:47,979 --> 03:11:18,790
that game to be as hard as it was. That game was hard. Like really hard. Lettuce. German 985's

845
03:11:18,790 --> 03:11:43,700
gamer room. Then I added a details like Funko Pops. It's crazy. This takes forever. This, they're

846
03:11:43,700 --> 03:12:05,719
being fed, right? Yep. Don't ignore it. Where's Lala? Where's Lala? You know, I would do it,

847
03:12:06,360 --> 03:12:11,479
but I think a lot of people ask for it a little too much. We had somebody come in here and ask

848
03:12:11,479 --> 03:12:25,079
for the, the ooh, ah-ha-ha thing. I don't know if people have been asking a little too much for it.

849
03:12:25,079 --> 03:12:27,239
I don't know. I mean, people have been asking for it.

850
03:12:45,030 --> 03:13:04,360
I'm not doing that again for at least three months. That's on, that is only three months

851
03:13:04,360 --> 03:13:32,969
cool down. I told you three grand. That's exactly what we're doing. Three grand. Three thousand

852
03:13:32,969 --> 03:13:56,969
dollars. It's going to be pretty close. Almost exact. All right. Now I want to buy the new area.

853
03:13:57,610 --> 03:14:12,870
But I also want to see what I can do here. Utilities. Portable water tap. Warp tech.

854
03:14:12,870 --> 03:14:26,420
Okay. Right. Decorations. Upgrades. Water tank. Extra tank. Tank booster. There we go. All right.

855
03:14:26,420 --> 03:14:41,209
It's 10 tabby plorts and 450. So let me get the tabby plorts. 10 tabby plorts. And let's open this

856
03:14:41,209 --> 03:15:25,610
up. New area. What the hell is that sound? Ooh. Oh, this is another. Ooh. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I

857
03:15:25,610 --> 03:15:39,909
have coughed like in your face. So this is just extra space. All right. Is there anything else

858
03:15:39,909 --> 03:16:08,649
I can do here? Whatever's down here. What's this? Tide pools. So this is all just expansion on the

859
03:16:08,649 --> 03:16:16,059
conservatory. How do I get out of here? Like out of the island? Because I mean, look, there's

860
03:16:16,059 --> 03:16:25,260
definitely at least another area or two to explore, right? How do I get out of here?

861
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:41,770
Do I have to feed the giant slimes? Okay. Where am I now? Which are the big slimes should I feed?

862
03:16:41,770 --> 03:17:00,729
The vegetable one or the fruit one? The veggie one? Does the veggie one also eat meat? Which

863
03:17:00,729 --> 03:17:06,569
one of them eats meat? Because I'm going to bring like a hundred chickens. No. Damn it. I don't think

864
03:17:06,569 --> 03:17:18,360
I even have enough vegetables. The pink one will eat the meat. Because there's this one here and

865
03:17:18,360 --> 03:17:24,659
this one here. One of them's fruits, one's vegetables. Pink is any. All right. So we're

866
03:17:24,659 --> 03:17:28,549
going to feed the big slimes. That's the next. That's the next part. That's the next part of the

867
03:17:28,549 --> 03:18:18,409
plot. I feel like these have taken so long. That's the deal. Okay. 450. I can carry 30 of each thing.

868
03:18:18,409 --> 03:18:30,170
Okay. Cool. Jet pack. I don't have it yet. Dash boots. Power core. Don't really need these right

869
03:18:30,170 --> 03:18:40,100
now, but I definitely wanted that. All right. Let's go. Do you remember why don't you say penis on

870
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:59,159
stream? I just did. And I have, what are you talking about? All right. We got to go feed people.

871
03:18:59,159 --> 03:19:08,969
I need vegetables. I'm just going on a vegetable hunt. That's it. Just picking up a hundred of each

872
03:19:08,969 --> 03:19:16,059
one. What's my take on kefir? I love kefir. There's kefir in my fridge right now. It's amazing.

873
03:19:18,760 --> 03:19:40,549
It is amazing. Highly recommend it. You grow your own. Oh no. Grow my own kefir? Look, that's a

874
03:19:40,549 --> 03:19:45,770
very, that's a huge process that I want nothing to do with. I just want to buy it and drink it.

875
03:19:45,850 --> 03:20:06,899
It's not that hard. Yeah. Hold on. Is it like making your own kombucha or whatever it is?

876
03:20:07,459 --> 03:20:12,260
We have to get like that weird circle alien bacteria thing and stick it in. I don't know.

877
03:20:12,260 --> 03:20:26,180
I don't like it. It's not that hard. Scoby. Yep. It's this weird hockey puck of bacteria

878
03:20:26,180 --> 03:20:39,110
that sits on top of the kombucha. It's wicked easy, dude. Just leave milk out in the sun.

879
03:20:39,510 --> 03:20:44,729
Oh yeah. That's how you do it. Thanks for the help. Thanks for the tip on how to make kefir.

880
03:20:45,530 --> 03:20:58,280
Just leave milk out in the sun. Cool. I guess that's how you do it. It's not how you do it.

881
03:20:58,280 --> 03:21:15,700
Is it really that difficult to make though for real? It kind of is. It starts with kefir crystals.

882
03:21:15,700 --> 03:21:22,200
Okay. My parents do it. It's not hard. I don't, it probably doesn't, it's probably not hard,

883
03:21:22,200 --> 03:21:25,959
but it probably takes a while, doesn't it? How long does it like the fermentation process take?

884
03:21:25,959 --> 03:21:34,540
At least a couple weeks or something, right? Or at least a week. No, I don't fuck with anything

885
03:21:34,540 --> 03:21:38,870
like that. I don't fuck with fermentation. I don't fuck with making anything like that ever

886
03:21:38,870 --> 03:21:45,799
because what you are doing, you are making a fermented product. You are taking milk,

887
03:21:45,799 --> 03:21:53,340
which I mean, I don't know, man. Like I don't want to make kefir. Oh, I made my own kefir.

888
03:21:53,340 --> 03:22:01,479
I made my own kombucha and take one sip and instapuke and go to the hospital. I don't feel

889
03:22:01,479 --> 03:22:10,219
like doing that. Why do that when I can just buy it? Oh, it turns out you made it wrong and

890
03:22:10,219 --> 03:22:13,979
there's a bunch of other bacteria in this and you just drank, you just drank. Now you're going to

891
03:22:13,979 --> 03:22:18,979
go to the hospital because you just puked and it's like you instapuked. Wine is fermented. Yeah,

892
03:22:18,979 --> 03:22:35,780
I'm not waking my own wine in the closet over here. Like people have like, you know, like the FDA and

893
03:22:35,780 --> 03:22:42,420
shit, right? Or you, I don't know. When you buy kombucha at the store or when you buy kefir from

894
03:22:42,420 --> 03:22:47,700
the supermarket or whatever, I don't think it's coming from some random dude's closet.

895
03:22:48,899 --> 03:23:08,680
Isn't there like regulation on the milk? I don't know. I like FDA. Yeah. Okay.

896
03:23:09,719 --> 03:23:18,979
I don't know. Well, I don't know. It's not, it's not like some guy like on the, I don't know. It's

897
03:23:18,979 --> 03:23:24,500
not like the back of the carton's like, Hey, my name is Dave. I made this. My name is Dave. I made

898
03:23:24,500 --> 03:23:31,219
this with my bare feet. Like, okay. That doesn't, no, it's made in a processing facility where

899
03:23:31,780 --> 03:23:37,989
cleanliness and, you know, this is like, there's the process involved and there's even trained

900
03:23:37,989 --> 03:23:42,899
employees and people that know what they're doing. I don't know. Maybe, maybe Dave's bare feet

901
03:23:44,100 --> 03:23:56,920
kombuchas. I don't know. I'm afraid of products that are fermented. Dude, FDA is federally Dave

902
03:23:56,920 --> 03:24:09,500
approved. You are full of shit. You would not buy, you would not. I'm looking at you right now. I

903
03:24:09,500 --> 03:24:13,340
moved you. I put you over here. I moved you from over here to over here. I'm reading you up right

904
03:24:13,340 --> 03:24:18,299
now. If you would not buy a product, if it was called Dave's bare feet kombucha, you wouldn't

905
03:24:18,299 --> 03:24:40,219
buy it. You wouldn't buy it. I know you wouldn't. I'd probably try it, dude. You don't know me, man.

906
03:24:40,219 --> 03:25:02,969
I guess not. What about the show called Barefoot Contesta? The show, okay. The show Barefoot

907
03:25:02,969 --> 03:25:11,819
Contesta is not called Barefoot Contesta's bare feet kombucha. That's, that's, that's not the same.

908
03:25:12,139 --> 03:25:22,459
The product is called Dave's bare feet kombucha. That's a huge difference. There's a huge difference.

909
03:25:22,459 --> 03:25:52,420
What about wine? Moving on. Drinking wine. What about wine? No, it's not. That doesn't happen.

910
03:25:53,059 --> 03:26:04,250
All right. I have a lot of vegetables that I need to prepare. They do that. What about the wine stuff?

911
03:26:04,250 --> 03:26:29,020
You stomp grapes, dude. Yes, some small batch wine person place is, will do that. Maybe the, when you

912
03:26:29,020 --> 03:26:36,840
buy the, oh, there's a wine called, isn't there a wine called like Barefeet? The most popular wine

913
03:26:36,840 --> 03:26:49,610
in the world is like Barefeet wine or something, isn't it? Listen, I'm trying to say that, uh,

914
03:26:49,610 --> 03:26:55,319
but if they don't, I was trying to say the big like corporate wine companies aren't like

915
03:26:55,319 --> 03:27:04,090
Barefeet wines, but there it is. I'll take the, Barefoot wine. Wines. I lose. I lose. Sometimes

916
03:27:04,090 --> 03:27:10,549
you lose. Sometimes you lose. I'm going to lose. I take a loss. I'll lose this one. I'll lose it.

917
03:27:10,549 --> 03:27:25,129
Yep. I lose. That's a loss. I hate, I don't like losing. I lose. I don't want, I hate losing. All

918
03:27:25,129 --> 03:27:37,219
right. Fine. I lose. Fine. I lose. Oh, I fucking hate losing. Okay. Now stop feeding it to, all

919
03:27:37,219 --> 03:27:45,020
right. I got to deposit this crap. Yes. Hold on. But wait, I'm getting backed up by a mob though.

920
03:27:46,040 --> 03:27:55,399
It's not, it's called Barefoot wine, not Dave's Barefeet wine. That it's, there is a semantic

921
03:27:55,399 --> 03:28:11,370
difference here. Yes. There's a difference. Dave's, Dave's Barefeet wine versus Barefoot wine. One is

922
03:28:11,370 --> 03:28:18,219
implying that Dave's Barefeet were in this drink. And the other one is like, oh, Barefoot everywhere

923
03:28:18,219 --> 03:28:24,659
on the beach. Maybe we're, I don't know, relaxing at home or I don't know. You know what I'm saying?

924
03:28:24,659 --> 03:28:50,360
There's a different, there's a different context. Dude, you're weird. All right. All right. Let's go

925
03:28:50,360 --> 03:29:04,899
feed the big guy. Wait, hold on. I got to answer this. Somebody said really important. Oh fuck. I

926
03:29:04,899 --> 03:29:09,209
missed it. Somebody said this is really important for context. Remember this will make or break the

927
03:29:09,209 --> 03:29:15,209
argument. Okay. Does the packaging look homemade and does Dave have his picture on the box?

928
03:29:15,690 --> 03:29:50,569
Um, come on, you have to give me some credit. Yes. I love this car. It's so stupid. I'm not buying it.

929
03:29:50,569 --> 03:29:56,120
That's worse. No, but it's, it's not that it's worse. It's okay. Let me make some money.

930
03:29:58,280 --> 03:30:07,690
But is it just his face? Okay. Is it Dave going like this? Does Dave have a big beard? Okay. Does

931
03:30:07,690 --> 03:30:19,459
Dave have a huge beard? I feel like it'd be Dave going like, and he's got a huge beard. Then like,

932
03:30:19,459 --> 03:30:25,129
okay, that's just Dave. And like, maybe that means like Dave is, I don't know, likes to be barefoot

933
03:30:25,129 --> 03:30:36,520
and whatever on the beach or whatever. No, it's just, it's his, it's his bare feet. Then no,

934
03:30:36,520 --> 03:30:42,219
then absolutely not. I don't want it. You guys are distracting the fuck out of me right now.

935
03:30:56,309 --> 03:31:00,389
Guys, no one would do this with their marketing. No one would be like, Hey, I have an idea.

936
03:31:00,389 --> 03:31:04,069
I'm going to make a wine and it's going to be called Dave's Barefeet Wine. And oh, by the way,

937
03:31:04,069 --> 03:31:07,909
let me remind people that it's my bare feet that is crushing the grapes. And I'm going to put my

938
03:31:07,909 --> 03:31:14,260
feet on the picture on the packaging. No marketing 101 would be like, um, I don't know if you,

939
03:31:14,260 --> 03:31:33,000
I don't, I don't think we do that. Somebody typed this. I need to find out if it's for real.

940
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:42,229
Barefoot's creator, his first wine he made in his garage. It was called Barefoot Burgundy. What?

941
03:31:43,930 --> 03:32:02,950
It's true. It can't be. Barefoot Wine. Was somebody named Davis? No, it was not. Wow. That's

942
03:32:02,950 --> 03:32:18,629
unfucking believable. Take our very beginnings. California winemaker, Davis first created Barefoot

943
03:32:18,629 --> 03:32:24,149
Burgundy in his garage. The unconventional name referred to what else? The free spirited method

944
03:32:24,149 --> 03:32:41,190
of crushing grapes barefoot. Fast forward. Here we are today. His name was Davis. Wow. Oh, this is an

945
03:32:41,190 --> 03:32:48,649
Omega loss that I'm taking here. This is like a huge L. You just watched me get absolutely eviscerated

946
03:32:48,649 --> 03:32:59,479
on stream. Has that happened before? Have I ever been this eviscerated on camera? I don't think so.

947
03:33:00,280 --> 03:33:03,879
This is an absolute complete and total incorrect statement. I've been making this whole time.

948
03:33:05,340 --> 03:33:23,350
Wow. We told you now last week you were wrong about goat cheese too. I stand by that.

949
03:33:25,459 --> 03:33:31,370
Apologize. I apologize for having no, I'm not apologizing because I don't, I don't know. I,

950
03:33:31,450 --> 03:33:44,870
I don't know. Are you going to? No. Okay. Let's play Slime Rancher. I took the L. I lose. Um,

951
03:33:45,909 --> 03:33:59,379
it was Barefoot Wine. Oh, what a loss. Okay. I got some fruits and vegetables. We're going

952
03:33:59,379 --> 03:34:18,200
to go check out our buddy up here. But what if it was called like Davis like fart bread

953
03:34:18,200 --> 03:34:26,180
or Dave's like fart wine? Would you still, would you drink it? Dave's saying like I farted. I farted

954
03:34:26,180 --> 03:34:31,540
in the, okay, hold on. I farted in the room this was made in was like in quotes on the,

955
03:34:32,540 --> 03:34:41,100
right on the, on the label. Would you drink it? It's just like, I farted in the room where this

956
03:34:41,100 --> 03:34:50,860
was made. It's probably time to cease, Jerma. This is reaching now. Wow. This is, you're reaching

957
03:34:50,860 --> 03:35:01,979
hard. All right. The mods are telling me to stop. Is this reaching? Yeah, this is reaching pretty

958
03:35:01,979 --> 03:35:09,690
hard, I think. No, you can keep going, dude. Sorry. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

959
03:35:09,690 --> 03:35:18,170
no, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't 180 on me. Rain me in here. You can go. Pepe laugh. Do what

960
03:35:18,170 --> 03:35:34,940
you want. Pepe laugh. Is that a no? Oh, all right. Where, where, where are you? Where's the big slime?

961
03:35:34,940 --> 03:35:59,299
Where's the big slime? Where's the big slime? It's in a cave. Oh, oh, it's down here. Okay.

962
03:35:59,299 --> 03:36:38,920
This is fruits. Ooh. Okay. So now we're under here. Watered yet? Um, this is a certain port.

963
03:37:03,799 --> 03:37:29,340
Okay. Can I put this in here? No. Is this a cat? I think that's a cat. Okay. So we've got to come

964
03:37:29,340 --> 03:37:34,780
back down here and that's a cat slime. I think does it count if I take one of the,

965
03:37:34,780 --> 03:37:46,819
I think that counts, right? I do want to go to the, okay, this one over here because that's

966
03:37:46,819 --> 03:38:37,340
the vegetable one, right? Come on, dude. All right. The other one is over here. Ooh.

967
03:38:38,459 --> 03:39:44,760
Large pink bonza. More? There we go. All right. What do you got? What, carrots?

968
03:39:44,760 --> 03:40:19,590
I feel like I just blew up that town in Fallout 3. Um, what does that do? Oh,

969
03:40:20,309 --> 03:40:26,229
you look at that. Okay. All right. I got to go back and deposit and then I'm going that way.

970
03:40:26,229 --> 03:41:18,069
Nice. Unlock. What are these? Like, what are these things you're pulling out here?

971
03:41:18,069 --> 03:41:24,620
At 24 minutes and 20 seconds in the second German video, L.A. Noire, the German craft killer.

972
03:41:24,620 --> 03:41:46,870
All right. Detective Andy. He holds up a bottle of barefoot wine to the camera. Okay. I'm not,

973
03:41:46,870 --> 03:42:40,100
I can't drink it. Why can't I drink it? It's literally the thumbnail. All right. I got to,

974
03:42:40,100 --> 03:42:56,899
there's a lot of money to be made here. I got to feed a lot of people. Hold on.

975
03:42:56,979 --> 03:43:41,110
Dave's bread. Dave's bread is great. Okay. It's time to do a huge turn in here very soon.

976
03:43:41,110 --> 03:43:56,809
This is going to be a lot of money. This is going to be more money than I know what to do with.

977
03:43:56,809 --> 03:44:24,700
Look at this. Uh, how many of these do I need? The, that door. Just one? Just one? Cool.

978
03:44:24,700 --> 03:44:46,219
I don't know. You're hungry. How are you? Hold on. I'll feed them.

979
03:45:23,209 --> 03:45:34,170
Any more? I think we're good. Maybe we'll be at five grand. It's overflowing.

980
03:45:34,170 --> 03:46:13,209
Make sure to save a tabby plort. Yep. 4200 bucks. What can I do? All right. Pink plorts

981
03:46:13,209 --> 03:46:25,020
is more health. I still need the ore. I don't have any. Yeah. Okay. I have enough jelly stones.

982
03:46:25,020 --> 03:46:39,219
Um, I don't think I can do anything. Very cool. It's time. Dude, I just banked the money. I don't

983
03:46:39,219 --> 03:46:51,479
need it. What about tomatoes? I don't really need to give my tomato opinion again. I feel like it

984
03:46:51,479 --> 03:47:05,000
been pretty clear about it. All right. I need a tabby plort.

985
03:47:15,420 --> 03:47:39,059
Is this thing fully upgraded? I'm just going to buy it. Is everything fully upgraded? Uh,

986
03:47:39,059 --> 03:48:01,579
this pen over here could use it. I need another slime. All right. This thing's ready. Do you

987
03:48:01,579 --> 03:48:09,319
prefer a fast food place to wrap your burger in paper or foil? Paper. Something about foil.

988
03:48:09,319 --> 03:48:12,200
I feel like I'm going to accidentally eat a piece and it's like, I just ate metal.

989
03:48:12,920 --> 03:48:41,370
Monka S. If I eat some paper, I don't care. Boil will keep it warm. Boil makes it feel premium.

990
03:48:45,239 --> 03:49:04,069
I didn't think about that. That's kind of true. That makes sense. Keeps it warm. Time to go open

991
03:49:04,069 --> 03:49:19,579
that thing. Burger or burrito. Uh, okay. Let me, let me backtrack a little. Burger or taco.

992
03:49:19,579 --> 03:49:26,950
That's harder. Burger or burrito. It's burger every time. Uh, I don't dislike burritos. I just,

993
03:49:26,950 --> 03:49:33,770
burgers are better in my brain, but burger versus taco. That's actually very hard for me

994
03:49:33,770 --> 03:49:38,280
because I don't think I could answer that. I really don't. All right. So it's down here.

995
03:49:38,280 --> 03:50:05,450
Burritos have a tendency to get really messy. What about tacos? All right. But okay. How do

996
03:50:05,450 --> 03:50:16,260
I word this? A taco is usually small, very small. And I can, I get through a taco and I'm like,

997
03:50:16,260 --> 03:50:23,989
all right, cool. Did I got two more tacos? Sure. I, yeah, I'll take another taco. That sounds great.

998
03:50:23,989 --> 03:50:34,790
But a burrito, burrito, unfortunately, is huge. They're usually big and stuffed full of stuff.

999
03:50:34,790 --> 03:50:38,950
So you get, sometimes you might get halfway through burrito and it's just like, I don't

1000
03:50:38,950 --> 03:50:44,870
really want the rest of this. Tacos, you can kind of portion out what you want. Where a burrito,

1001
03:50:44,870 --> 03:50:52,469
a big burrito especially, you're committed here. You could wrap it back up and put it in the fridge,

1002
03:50:52,469 --> 03:51:04,459
but I don't know. I'd rather just eat what I want. And plus the street taco is sort of, I mean,

1003
03:51:04,459 --> 03:51:11,340
if you have the soft shell, kind of soft street taco, it kind of is a burrito. It's just a small

1004
03:51:11,340 --> 03:51:16,950
one. I don't like the big burrito. And things I don't, I like one thing, tacos to me, I like

1005
03:51:16,950 --> 03:51:22,629
because you've got the layers. It's meat, cheese. And then on top of the cheese is lettuce. And on

1006
03:51:22,629 --> 03:51:26,389
top of the lettuce is tomatoes, whatever, right? It's a layered experience and everything doesn't

1007
03:51:26,389 --> 03:51:34,260
kind of mush together. A burrito, everything gets mushed into this soup in the middle. And

1008
03:51:35,049 --> 03:51:41,739
I'm talking and everything turns into kind of this weird meat soup where it's just kind of

1009
03:51:41,739 --> 03:51:50,059
everything mushes together. I like it being kind of separated in the taco. Now, let me make,

1010
03:51:50,059 --> 03:51:59,819
I gotta make this really 100% clear. If you gave me a burrito right now and you said, hey, eat this,

1011
03:51:59,819 --> 03:52:10,020
it's a burrito. I'd go, yes, that sounds fucking incredible. It's not like an S tier versus D tier.

1012
03:52:10,020 --> 03:52:16,579
It's like an A plus tier versus A minus tier, if that makes any sense. So there you go. This

1013
03:52:16,579 --> 03:52:28,069
might take on burritos versus tacos. All right, where was that? Down here, right? Where's the

1014
03:52:28,069 --> 03:52:47,110
cave? I forgot where that cave was. I feel like it's right here somewhere, right? Where is it?

1015
03:52:47,110 --> 03:53:00,729
Can you guys help? It's over near the beach. Can you help? Thank you. I appreciate the help.

1016
03:53:00,729 --> 03:53:09,190
What about, what's your favorite Indian dish? I mean, butter chicken is just, you cannot, I can't,

1017
03:53:09,270 --> 03:53:17,659
it's just, it's just S tier. It's 10, 110 out of 10. How do I get out? How do I get, okay, I gotta

1018
03:53:17,659 --> 03:53:38,979
talk about, no more food. I need to find this cave. Wait, where was it? Like down here? No,

1019
03:53:38,979 --> 03:53:57,739
it wasn't at like here. I wish I could mark stuff. Was it up? Somebody help me. I genuinely don't

1020
03:53:57,739 --> 03:54:49,989
know. It was like a cave thing here somewhere down off the cliff. It wasn't over here somewhere.

1021
03:54:49,989 --> 03:54:55,020
The line on the map. No, no, no, no. I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for the place where

1022
03:54:55,020 --> 03:55:02,700
I can shoot this port. It was like up and then down and then I just honestly have no, I have,

1023
03:55:02,700 --> 03:55:22,059
I do not remember where it was. It's near the conservatory. Is it? Isn't it just like right

1024
03:55:22,059 --> 03:55:44,739
here? Yeah. All right. Here it is. Yeah. I was like, no, there's no way. There we go. Tank guard.

1025
03:55:44,739 --> 03:56:10,219
What is that? Pretty cool. All right. Now let's go to the next area down here. 37 year old

1026
03:56:10,299 --> 03:56:25,190
Jerma is whack. I turned 37 guys and now every stream is a crack stream. Have I ever had

1027
03:56:25,190 --> 03:56:48,040
octopus? I haven't. I don't like it. It creeps me out. It's a little weird for me. All right. So

1028
03:56:48,040 --> 03:57:08,459
from here, go. Even squid too. Squid kind of freaks me out too. Something about it. I really

1029
03:57:08,459 --> 03:57:16,860
don't want to ruin the calamari for anybody, but it looks very specifically like something

1030
03:57:16,860 --> 03:57:38,469
that I do not, I don't like. Here we go. Move. Although I do have a bunch of shit. Maybe I

1031
03:57:38,469 --> 03:57:47,020
should get rid of this. They look like spiders like lying on their backs with their legs in the

1032
03:57:47,020 --> 03:57:58,299
air dead. When you get like calamari where it's like, you know what I'm saying? They had the

1033
03:57:58,299 --> 03:58:19,379
legs. They're like this. What kind of 37 year old is afraid of calamari? I don't sit in the

1034
03:58:19,379 --> 03:58:23,860
restaurant and freak out when the calamari comes. Somebody orders calamari. I go, oh, all right,

1035
03:58:23,860 --> 03:58:30,280
cool. I'm not going to have any, but I hope you like it. It's not like the guy doesn't walk over

1036
03:58:30,280 --> 03:58:39,100
with the fajita plate like shh. And I'm just like, no, no, I have to leave. I'm fine. I don't

1037
03:58:39,180 --> 03:59:14,299
care. I might even eat one new zone. Let's go. I need a new slime and go. All right. I found

1038
03:59:14,299 --> 03:59:37,750
what I'm going to put. Let's make that sound. What did I miss it? I missed it. I didn't,

1039
03:59:37,750 --> 03:59:40,469
I didn't even know what I was supposed to be looking for. It looked like just a regular.

1040
03:59:40,469 --> 04:00:12,569
It looked like a cat slime beats. All right. It's just white. Okay. What do rocks eat?

1041
04:00:12,569 --> 04:00:49,129
Ed cheese. Really? You don't need meat. What has happened? That scared the shit out of me, man.

1042
04:01:27,659 --> 04:01:44,100
No, please make it. Oh my fucking God. What? What happened? What ever back? I'm gonna pee.

1043
04:01:44,100 --> 04:01:52,620
What the fuck? I, you die instantly and you lose everything. I was trying to bring it back.

1044
04:01:52,620 --> 04:03:31,700
Beer B fucking game is not even fun. Uh, I got a lot of cleanup to do though. I, so I was muted,

1045
04:03:31,700 --> 04:03:38,709
but, um, I might haven't cleaned my room in a while and I didn't clean my room. So I got to

1046
04:03:38,709 --> 04:04:30,489
clean my room. Um, so I, I'll, um, I'll be right back again. Okay. No. Why would I leave the mic

1047
04:04:30,489 --> 04:04:37,620
on and just smashing windows? All right. Um, all right. I'll actually be right back.

1048
04:04:40,360 --> 04:05:00,360
Modeling is a house. Oh man. I was muted. I was, I was dying over here. I just people like,

1049
04:05:00,360 --> 04:05:06,420
what is he doing? I was, if you look up smash controller sound effect, it's one of the first

1050
04:05:06,420 --> 04:05:16,379
two and this, this, whoever's doing this is really hitting it on something and it won't break.

1051
04:05:16,940 --> 04:09:53,590
It's not breaking. All right. BRB for real. Hello again. Okay. I think it's time to dial the, uh,

1052
04:09:53,590 --> 04:10:02,120
maybe a little bit of erratic stream behavior here. I think we're going to pull it back a little

1053
04:10:02,120 --> 04:10:14,020
and chill and relax the next part of the stream. Okay. Hey dude, can you reduce the bit rate of

1054
04:10:14,020 --> 04:10:24,299
the stream so I can finish downloading devil may cry five? Uh, just put it in one ADP or something.

1055
04:10:24,299 --> 04:10:38,489
You can do that. You can do that on your own. Put it in like 240 feet. All right. So what was

1056
04:10:38,489 --> 04:10:45,399
I doing? Right. Oh, I died. That's right. It's also funny that I'm not even using a controller.

1057
04:10:45,399 --> 04:10:51,940
Okay. Is there a way I can tell? I got to teleport. I have a teleporter. Don't I?

1058
04:10:55,239 --> 04:11:10,139
Do I have to buy it or unlock it? Cause I have access to this teleporting pod,

1059
04:11:10,139 --> 04:11:29,379
but do I have to actually make it? Oh, okay. I need 10. Perfect. I need 10, uh, bunny

1060
04:11:29,379 --> 04:11:33,700
ports and I'm good to go. Do I have any in here? No. All right. I can do it.

1061
04:11:33,700 --> 04:11:40,809
When you can play trombone champ. I don't know. Maybe whenever I stream next tomorrow,

1062
04:11:40,809 --> 04:11:54,700
the next day, I need just regular bunny ports

1063
04:12:12,760 --> 04:12:35,530
at more than 30. Damn. Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

1064
04:12:37,879 --> 04:12:58,069
I'm 38. You're not old. Thank you. That's a nice thing to say. Appreciate it.

1065
04:13:06,180 --> 04:13:14,329
All right. So we got to get this one loaded because eventually there's going to be

1066
04:13:14,329 --> 04:13:23,000
some buddy in here. Okay. First things first. I'm going to do a one pole here.

1067
04:13:24,280 --> 04:13:31,379
There's a lot of ports I need to collect. Very important.

1068
04:13:34,229 --> 04:14:26,860
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Now I need 10 of the cotton floors. Let's build it. So now I can

1069
04:14:26,860 --> 04:14:32,469
actually teleport. Um, and I'm not going to get stuck somewhere and not be able to go anywhere.

1070
04:14:32,469 --> 04:14:54,420
All right. Let's do it. Build it home portal one. Oh, one way travel back to the conservatory. It's

1071
04:14:54,420 --> 04:15:09,000
T. I need to build it here. This gadget is installed permanently until demolished. Should

1072
04:15:09,000 --> 04:15:16,870
I put it somewhere else? Oh, okay. Let me put it. Where should I put it? Can I put it pretty much

1073
04:15:16,870 --> 04:15:22,069
anywhere? I can. All right. I definitely want it next to the house. Yeah. Without a doubt.

1074
04:15:27,000 --> 04:15:44,329
Right next to the house. Very cool. Okay. So this brings me. What did I, what just happened? What

1075
04:15:44,329 --> 04:16:05,909
the hell just happened? Don't I, how do I, it's a one way home portal, but how do I use it to go

1076
04:16:05,909 --> 04:16:27,340
back? I wasted it. It's one way. Yeah. But it's not like a town portal in Diablo where like, oh,

1077
04:16:27,340 --> 04:16:33,270
I'm going to leave and I go back to that. I have to build. Okay. All right. All right. Let me,

1078
04:16:33,270 --> 04:16:53,270
let me make sure I get this right. So I want to go here. Let's go one way to your home.

1079
04:16:53,270 --> 04:16:59,860
Fuck. I thought it meant like I could, I thought it was a permanent thing that just stayed there.

1080
04:16:59,860 --> 04:17:13,659
It's what can I take it back? You build it in the wilderness for a quick trip home. Yeah. But I

1081
04:17:13,659 --> 04:17:19,739
thought it was a permanent fixture here and I had like a town portal scroll that I clicked on or so.

1082
04:17:19,739 --> 04:17:46,409
So what the fuck is the point of that? I just wasted all those resources too. Didn't I?

1083
04:17:46,409 --> 04:18:05,260
How do I remove it? I get it back. I don't get it back. I don't fucking get it back. Well,

1084
04:18:05,260 --> 04:18:12,870
when I built it down here, it was like, Oh, I had to build it here. I had to build one of these down

1085
04:18:12,870 --> 04:18:15,989
here. And then it was like, Oh, make sure to go into gadget mode and put it down. I didn't know

1086
04:18:15,989 --> 04:18:21,379
it was, that's how it worked. I thought it was like a permanent like teleporter upgrade for the

1087
04:18:21,379 --> 04:18:48,149
wait. Why can I, I can still do it. I think I'm fine. I'm fine. I can still do it. I can still do

1088
04:18:48,149 --> 04:19:41,500
it. Yeah, we're good. All right. I want to go get some slimes here. Free food. Okay. Let's go. Now

1089
04:19:43,190 --> 04:19:49,510
let me get my stuff that I want to get. They were beats. They were, there was new slimes.

1090
04:19:49,510 --> 04:20:25,750
There was a rock slime. It was a, it was a stealth assassin slime. Let's not blow it please. All

1091
04:20:25,750 --> 04:20:45,989
right. There we go. Yep. There we go. Oh, you're too big. But I did get one of the, one of the

1092
04:20:45,989 --> 04:21:23,370
plorts. I can use that. Okay. Let me find just a little small version. What's going on over there?

1093
04:21:23,370 --> 04:21:56,149
Is that a beehive? Oh shit. Wild honey. All right. I'll take it. Honey slime. Oh hell yeah. Let's go.

1094
04:22:05,030 --> 04:22:37,620
Get the fuck away from me. I don't know what that is, but I kind of want it. Oh, I don't,

1095
04:22:37,620 --> 04:22:57,850
maybe I could get one. What do they eat? Veggies, right? I just want a blue one to eat a vegetable.

1096
04:22:57,850 --> 04:23:10,500
What is that thing? Look at this weird apple. Mint mango? Shit. Um, I think it's important to

1097
04:23:10,500 --> 04:23:22,409
have this. I'm not going back yet. I want some more rocks and some more. I think the wild honey

1098
04:23:22,409 --> 04:23:37,719
back too. Whoa. Angler slime. That's too much. That's too much shit. Look at all this stuff.

1099
04:23:37,719 --> 04:23:47,610
So I don't have it. I need a bigger inventory. Okay. I have to go back. I want a bigger inventory.

1100
04:23:48,090 --> 04:23:52,680
Let me see if I can find some more of these.

1101
04:23:58,950 --> 04:24:04,489
My whole life just flashed before my eyes. I can't believe I shit my pants in the fucking second

1102
04:24:04,489 --> 04:25:05,500
grade. Jesus. What is that? How do I get the first two? All right. It's time to go before I die.

1103
04:25:05,500 --> 04:25:31,500
What is that? Oh, this is, I need this ore. Oh God damn it. Um, all right. I know what this is though.

1104
04:26:08,180 --> 04:26:28,459
What was this? No, no, no. I don't want that. Buzz wax? No, you're more important. Kubrick's stare.

1105
04:26:28,540 --> 04:26:53,780
How do I get more slots in my backpack? I have to upgrade it. Is it even on the list of things

1106
04:26:53,780 --> 04:27:32,459
to upgrade? It was. I didn't even see it. Backpack size, not capacity. Okay. I wonder what it needs.

1107
04:27:32,459 --> 04:27:57,239
Okay. For a second, I thought everybody died in here. They didn't. That's just, there was

1108
04:27:57,239 --> 04:28:01,989
nothing in there to begin with. All right. So what are these guys like? Is it fruits? No,

1109
04:28:01,989 --> 04:28:09,299
they like vegetables. What about the honey slimes? Oh, you like fruits. Well, go on in.

1110
04:28:09,299 --> 04:28:17,059
This is ready for you. It's going to be delicious. Tons of plorts. It's going to be sick.

1111
04:28:20,420 --> 04:28:34,969
I believe it is time. I think it's time to retire bunnies maybe. Yep. Either that or I need a new

1112
04:28:36,090 --> 04:29:04,950
plort thingy. Let me just put this here. And these, they want vegetables. All right. So we

1113
04:29:04,950 --> 04:29:18,090
got fruits, veggies, a lot of veggies. All right. Let's go. I think I'll make another garden too.

1114
04:29:18,889 --> 04:29:44,540
Yeah. I mean, I need some more vegetables. Okay. Cool. So it's, do you guys like fruit?

1115
04:29:44,540 --> 04:30:02,309
Let's fill this other one with fruit. Veggies going here. I got you guys. This is probably

1116
04:30:02,309 --> 04:30:08,069
one of the last times I feed the, maybe not. I don't know. What should I do?

1117
04:30:17,000 --> 04:30:39,000
Clear some of the hens out. All right. Don't retire any. Keep them all. Yeah. I mean,

1118
04:30:39,000 --> 04:30:43,559
but they're not going to be worth, the plorts aren't worth anything. And if I have to keep

1119
04:30:43,559 --> 04:31:03,379
feeding a dozen of these, I feel like I'm going to waste food. Okay. So what do I want to make?

1120
04:31:04,020 --> 04:31:18,120
I still have this, is this got a pond one? Deposit this shit. Hold on. All right. What is,

1121
04:31:18,120 --> 04:31:28,309
what is this thing you talking about? Tank booster, 30 units, extra tank. So this is it here.

1122
04:31:28,790 --> 04:32:00,340
I don't have any sand. Well, let's do this. I'm going to store 30 in here, maybe more

1123
04:32:00,979 --> 04:32:05,139
because I, you want at least 10 to 20 of every single plort, right? Just in case

1124
04:32:22,649 --> 04:32:36,729
100 of every plort. Okay. I have so much shit here. All right. Um,

1125
04:32:36,729 --> 04:33:01,020
um, honey rocks, maybe. Oh, you eat meat. Perfect. Uh, you're going to be in your own pen.

1126
04:33:01,020 --> 04:33:26,950
Is there any more pens? You need water for the angler slime? Maybe it's a pond. Um, well,

1127
04:33:26,950 --> 04:33:54,169
I have some more room down here. All right. I think it's a pond. Is this correct? You look

1128
04:33:54,169 --> 04:34:07,369
pretty happy in there. You look kind of happy, right? Are you trying to get out? I don't think

1129
04:34:07,369 --> 04:35:15,669
so. Right. Eat this. Nice. Nice. Should I feed you a rock or something? Let him out. How much

1130
04:35:15,669 --> 04:35:20,389
do the honey ones go for? All right. I got to start. Let's go. I'll keep getting distracted

1131
04:35:20,389 --> 04:35:58,259
and overwhelmed. Um, I need so much more room. Blood on the floor of that cage. Okay. You're

1132
04:35:58,259 --> 04:36:20,220
happy. You're kind of unhappy, but we're okay. Kind of, I think. Okay. Yikes. Okay. I need to

1133
04:36:20,220 --> 04:36:25,580
feed this to somebody. Who should I even? I think I'm going to feed it to you.

1134
04:36:25,580 --> 04:36:36,490
One of you guys in here. Just fuck it. Go for it. All right. Yeah. You eat meat and vegetables. All

1135
04:36:36,490 --> 04:36:51,209
right. Cool. Maybe I should turn, turn them into rock ones. That might be smart. Should I do rock,

1136
04:36:51,209 --> 04:37:03,689
uh, phosphorus or rock? Um, honey, honey, phosphorus, honey, phosphorus. That's what

1137
04:37:03,689 --> 04:37:15,270
I was thinking. All right. Well, there's a shit load over here, so let's do it.

1138
04:37:16,919 --> 04:37:48,020
All right. It's time for you to grow up. Cool. So they eat fruit. Good to know. They're too big.

1139
04:37:48,020 --> 04:38:26,009
I think they're okay. All right. What about rock honey? Rock honey? They might break out. They're

1140
04:38:26,009 --> 04:38:47,500
not going to break out. Okay. Fruit. Let's go back to what I was doing. These are worth 58 each. Uh,

1141
04:38:47,500 --> 04:39:02,380
yes, please. Thank you. So you guys are good. I need fruits. I have a lot of fruit over here.

1142
04:39:06,700 --> 04:39:25,720
Okay. Um,

1143
04:39:56,790 --> 04:40:04,619
overstimulation. No, I'm all right. This is veggies and I obviously want lots of rock stuff.

1144
04:40:05,180 --> 04:40:24,119
Yes. You know what? Just kind of keep it in there. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

1145
04:40:41,959 --> 04:40:47,990
All right. Cool.

1146
04:40:50,790 --> 04:41:03,930
All right. Cool. How you guys doing? What do you guys eat? Fruits? Yeah. All right. I'm coming.

1147
04:41:03,930 --> 04:41:24,900
I'm coming. Cool. I'm coming. Fuck. Um, hold on. 33. That's all right. He's never cleaned any of

1148
04:41:24,900 --> 04:42:06,169
these cells. Let's go do this. Um, I think I'm going to remove some of the phosphorus ones.

1149
04:42:06,889 --> 04:42:22,569
They, it's going to get too, it's going to get too wild in here. It's going to, it's going to get

1150
04:42:22,569 --> 04:42:35,529
actually unreasonable in here. Okay. I think that's all right. Maybe like two or three more.

1151
04:42:36,330 --> 04:43:11,419
That's enough. Why are there veggies in here? All right. Go be free. They're fine. They're fine.

1152
04:43:11,419 --> 04:43:23,639
They're fine. They're fine. Oh shit. Box box raid. What's up box box. Uh, welcome everybody. How are

1153
04:43:23,639 --> 04:43:32,409
you playing some slime ranch or two? I think I'm doing a pretty good job. Hope you had a good, uh,

1154
04:43:32,409 --> 04:43:45,740
stream box box. I've got a lot of, uh, stuff going on. Trying to make some money. I'm doing

1155
04:43:45,740 --> 04:44:00,389
all right so far. Things are going good. Where'd all this energy come from? I'm saying hello. I'm

1156
04:44:00,389 --> 04:44:17,189
welcoming a bunch of people that just got here. What was that? It was okay. I'm going to show you

1157
04:44:17,189 --> 04:44:23,560
this one day. The ring light is right here. So when I look up here, it's kind of really

1158
04:44:23,560 --> 04:44:46,729
bright in my face. So I can't really look into the camera because it's so bright. Okay. I have

1159
04:44:46,729 --> 04:45:02,900
almost a hundred of these phosphorus. I think I'm ready to leave. I think I'm ready to continue

1160
04:45:02,900 --> 04:45:16,090
what I was doing. Right? Let it just collect. I want to go get one of those, um, assassin raccoon

1161
04:45:16,090 --> 04:45:54,299
things. Let me fill up some of the wrong side. All right. Let's go. The inventory upgrade.

1162
04:45:54,299 --> 04:45:59,340
Thank you for reminding. Thank you. Seriously. I actually would have just completely just,

1163
04:45:59,340 --> 04:46:22,099
just glossed over that. What do I need? What was it again? Someone fed the AI thing,

1164
04:46:22,099 --> 04:46:26,340
the image of the stream, but erased just your face so it would auto-complete.

1165
04:46:32,700 --> 04:47:15,340
This is fucking hilarious. You ready? That's insane. There's another one. This one, I don't get it,

1166
04:47:15,340 --> 04:47:49,930
but I do. I want this as an emote or something. This picture is so perfect. What's the, uh,

1167
04:47:50,650 --> 04:48:23,909
the Pennywise actor? What was his name? Yeah. Bill Skarsgård. Bill Skarsgård. So ridiculous.

1168
04:48:23,909 --> 04:48:31,700
It's ridiculous. It really is. Okay. But the real question is how many yellow plorts did I need?

1169
04:48:31,700 --> 04:48:46,180
How could there only have been one elder chicken? It was 10, right? Okay. So hold on. I got to take...

1170
04:48:51,459 --> 04:49:10,889
It's 10 rock ports, not yellow. Is it?

1171
04:49:10,889 --> 04:49:30,419
Is it really rock ports?

1172
04:49:38,740 --> 04:50:09,419
Shit. All right. What do they eat? Veggies? Fuck. I need veggies. Hurry. I'm going to bed. So I wake

1173
04:50:09,419 --> 04:50:41,909
up and it'll be there. This is a long time to be asleep. Okay. Let's do this now. Oh, something in

1174
04:50:41,909 --> 04:50:49,060
my eye. You get something in your eye and it just doesn't stop for like an hour. It's annoying.

1175
04:50:50,779 --> 04:51:22,360
Okay. Excellent. You guys need to eat too. Uh, shit. Hold on. I'll be right back. Hold on. I'll be

1176
04:51:22,360 --> 04:51:34,790
back. I'm back. End of the stream, boys? Um, not, not yet. Maybe in a little bit. So what does it

1177
04:51:34,790 --> 04:51:52,310
take? Silky. Oh, I don't even have the sand for this. Or distort. Let me feed everybody again.

1178
04:51:52,310 --> 04:52:05,380
I got a lot of people to feed here. You ever played the first game? Yeah. I, uh, I beat the

1179
04:52:05,380 --> 04:52:50,619
first game on stream, didn't I? I remember correctly. You guys eat fruit. You need veggies

1180
04:52:50,619 --> 04:53:21,610
or meat. I can do that. You guys want fruit. Chickens. Come here. I'm going to be overflowing

1181
04:53:21,610 --> 04:53:53,779
with these. Oh, the angler. I'm just going to bring the angler up here. He hates us. He's not

1182
04:53:53,779 --> 04:55:06,630
reading chat. What are you on about? All right. Store it. All right. Cool. Let me go get the

1183
04:55:07,659 --> 04:55:15,930
other slime that's down here. I'm going to bring them out. I'm going to put them in that, uh, with

1184
04:55:15,930 --> 04:55:22,299
the other rocks and feed it a rock. I think that's a great idea. And what's, do you hear my voice

1185
04:55:22,299 --> 04:55:30,180
right now? I don't know what, I don't know why this is happening, but it is. Hey, come with me.

1186
04:55:30,259 --> 04:55:51,700
And then I'm going to feed a rock to this. It makes the most logical sense, I believe.

1187
04:55:55,159 --> 04:56:00,439
Go ahead and eat one. I guess I'll pull it if it's not. All right. We need, um, did you eat one?

1188
04:56:01,240 --> 04:56:14,580
All right. There we go. Perfect. Perfect. Let's go. It's time to continue. I think everyone's fine.

1189
04:56:14,580 --> 04:56:25,860
I could refill some fruit. He's not ready yet. Nope. Not quite. All right. All right. I'm going

1190
04:56:25,860 --> 04:56:51,689
now. I need to find sand. I'm going this way. The inventory slots. I need sand. I need what,

1191
04:56:51,689 --> 04:57:03,580
like silky sand or something, which I don't have. Is it, maybe it's on a beach. Could NPCs have

1192
04:57:03,580 --> 04:57:38,330
feelings if they're programmed to? Oh, a thinking face. Let's go. Stop at Wendy's on your way back.

1193
04:57:38,330 --> 04:57:45,529
You know, that's actually not a bad idea. Oh, somebody said food. That means streams ending

1194
04:57:45,529 --> 04:57:53,099
in like 30 minutes. Actually true though. Didn't I tell you guys, like, if you want,

1195
04:57:53,099 --> 04:57:57,099
if you want a stream to turn off, just talk about food after like seven or eight o'clock Pacific.

1196
04:57:57,099 --> 04:58:11,860
That's the quickest way for me to be like, oh yeah, food, eating humans. I eat. I need that.

1197
04:58:11,860 --> 04:58:33,270
I want the beat. I'm looking for, I guess I can take more rocks. That's fine. I do want the

1198
04:58:33,270 --> 04:58:51,619
recommend though. Do you recommend eating any of these? I don't think they're edible. Not, not,

1199
04:58:51,619 --> 04:59:00,299
not the humans though. I don't think, not the humans at least. You can play breath of the

1200
04:59:00,299 --> 04:59:29,909
wild tomorrow. Yes. I want to bring this guy back. Jesus. I still have not found the map

1201
04:59:29,909 --> 04:59:59,720
fragment thing here. Just kind of surprising to break these or something. Oh, no, I don't want

1202
04:59:59,720 --> 05:00:34,650
the honey. Okay. Ooh, meat. I have so many chickens. What's better, Greek or Italian food?

1203
05:00:34,650 --> 05:00:44,099
Uh, that is very hard. Depends on the day. I want to say Italian because Italian, it's just

1204
05:00:44,099 --> 05:01:08,009
chicken parm or, you know, you know what I'm saying? No, I'll, I'll joke aside. Italian

1205
05:01:08,009 --> 05:01:13,340
food is like one of my favorite. Uh, Mexican, Italian and Greek are probably one, two and three.

1206
05:01:13,340 --> 05:01:21,959
Probably in that order as well. I'm a sucker for American food too though. Just like that,

1207
05:01:21,959 --> 05:01:28,619
hot dogs, hamburgers, turkey sandwiches. Just like the, the, whoa, give me a bunch of these.

1208
05:01:29,259 --> 05:01:39,419
Is that that like a barbecue? Brisket's one of my favorite things in the world.

1209
05:01:39,419 --> 05:02:02,569
Um, I mean that's kind of style. I like a lot of different things. I really do. Good old-fashioned

1210
05:02:02,569 --> 05:02:18,250
American food. Yeah. Well, I'm going to have a ton of these now. They're going to need their own,

1211
05:02:18,330 --> 05:02:43,450
uh, they're going to need their own pen. 24? That's a lot. French fries? Well, they're actually not

1212
05:02:43,450 --> 05:02:51,779
called French fries, right? Aren't they just called, aren't they called crisps? No. Oh man,

1213
05:02:51,779 --> 05:03:02,919
I got that wrong. What, what is it? It's chips, right? Chips are fries. Crisps are chips, right?

1214
05:03:02,919 --> 05:03:08,340
Yeah, so it's not French fries. They're, they're chips. Isn't that what a lot of EU calls French

1215
05:03:08,340 --> 05:03:21,139
fries? Oh, another L. Oh, another L. That's British. Fries are French. So what do, okay,

1216
05:03:21,139 --> 05:03:33,639
if you're from France, what do you call French fries? What are they called? Chips? Frites?

1217
05:03:33,639 --> 05:03:55,110
Just fries. Frites. Okay. Yeah. So I need this. I'm just going to farm over here for a

1218
05:03:55,110 --> 05:04:03,500
sec because I, I need this. Silky sand is over here on the beach. I need 10 of them.

1219
05:04:03,500 --> 05:04:35,900
Come on. How can there not be any? Any. Oh my God. Hey, what'd you do with my stuff?

1220
05:04:35,900 --> 05:05:07,659
What did my, where's my silky sand go? I just lost all of it. Oh my God. Get out of the way.

1221
05:05:07,659 --> 05:05:37,270
Sand? Don't jump that. I'm an idiot. I need a lot more than this.

1222
05:05:57,290 --> 05:06:11,099
I'm trying to think of some other foods that I like. I just like sat there. It was silent. I

1223
05:06:11,099 --> 05:06:19,110
just was, I just was in my own world for at least a full minute. I was gone. I was not even sitting

1224
05:06:19,110 --> 05:06:26,419
here. I was in my own head thinking about how good brisket was. I was like, oh yeah, brisket. Man,

1225
05:06:26,419 --> 05:06:49,180
that's good shit. And I forgot I was playing. I was just sitting here. Meat brain. Yeah. A good

1226
05:06:49,180 --> 05:06:57,000
brisket is you do the food dancing. No, I don't even know why I'm telling you guys this. Whenever

1227
05:06:57,000 --> 05:07:06,860
I eat something I like that I really like, I just kind of start going like, I just start punching

1228
05:07:06,860 --> 05:07:17,369
the air. I'm kind of just like, does anybody else do that? If it's really good. And I'm like,

1229
05:07:17,369 --> 05:07:31,209
oh, this is awesome. Yeah. I feel like other people do that. Stop shooting the fucking sand.

1230
05:07:32,009 --> 05:07:52,409
I think my body just gets bored. That's the problem. My mind is focusing so hard on how much

1231
05:07:52,409 --> 05:07:55,770
I like the thing that my body's like, Hey, how come I'm not involved? Why am I not involved?

1232
05:07:55,770 --> 05:08:06,169
The mind is having a good time. Let's throw some punches. I only, I still only have three

1233
05:08:06,169 --> 05:08:32,779
sand. It's bullshit. I think like over here, right? I'll give me this like another two minutes.

1234
05:08:34,979 --> 05:08:56,250
I can't replicate it or anything, right? There's no sand at this beach. How can there be no sand

1235
05:08:56,250 --> 05:09:30,619
on this beach? I think I'm ready to go back. There we go. Let's get the, how do I get up there?

1236
05:09:30,619 --> 05:09:36,009
Sand comes from the mud. Geyser is on the ground. Really? Okay. I thought they've just scattered

1237
05:09:36,009 --> 05:10:21,430
around randomly. How do I get up here? Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,

1238
05:10:21,430 --> 05:10:39,639
stop. I want, I want, um, thank God. All right. Nice. Now I have, all right. Good. I haven't been

1239
05:10:39,639 --> 05:10:56,740
up here yet. Have I been up here? Yeah. I was earlier. I don't know. I'm going back. I have,

1240
05:10:56,740 --> 05:11:02,200
I can't get rid of any of this stuff. So I'm just going to get out of here. Tons of new slime. So

1241
05:11:02,200 --> 05:11:19,979
have I not found the map? What's your favorite Mexican dish? I can't answer that. I actually

1242
05:11:19,979 --> 05:11:34,700
can't answer that question. Some days I just feel like a wet burrito, just a wet burrito and eat it

1243
05:11:34,700 --> 05:11:53,659
with a fork and knife. Um, I love tacos. I love, I love everything. Yeah. Soggy, wet burrito,

1244
05:11:53,659 --> 05:11:59,000
just covered in the sauce. And you just like, you eat it. It's like a stew almost sometimes.

1245
05:11:59,720 --> 05:12:25,799
Favorite frozen pizza? It used to be Dr. Oakhurst, but you can't really find it anymore

1246
05:12:25,799 --> 05:12:38,310
the last few years. Where would you place plain cottage cheese on a tier list? Um, it can't be

1247
05:12:38,310 --> 05:12:46,150
plain. I would say cottage cheese with salt and pepper is, it's pretty high. I think a lot of

1248
05:12:46,150 --> 05:12:51,450
people sleep on cottage cheese. It's really good for you. It has a lot of nutrients, very dense.

1249
05:12:51,450 --> 05:13:02,979
It's really good, but you have to put salt and pepper on it. Salt and pepper. And that's it.

1250
05:13:02,979 --> 05:13:13,139
Just eat it like that. Just pepper. Pepper and cottage cheese need to be together. I don't like

1251
05:13:13,139 --> 05:13:20,709
cottage cheese. If anyone puts anything with sweetness or anything, no, no, no. All right.

1252
05:13:20,709 --> 05:13:30,419
I need another pen. I have so many of these and I'll do this and maybe, I don't know. Cottage

1253
05:13:30,419 --> 05:13:35,060
cheese is with sweet stuff like apples. Um, I, I prefer it with just pepper on it. Just salt and

1254
05:13:35,139 --> 05:13:45,450
pepper. No fruit. Nope. Salt and pepper. You already have the anglers with rock. Yeah,

1255
05:13:45,450 --> 05:13:52,900
but I think I want to do anglers and something else. Anglers and, uh, uh, ringtail. That'd be

1256
05:13:52,900 --> 05:14:03,830
cool. So let me go to the pen that I made down here. Hold on. Where is it? How am I even going

1257
05:14:03,830 --> 05:14:13,750
anymore? Cottage cheese and parmesan is good. I've never had that, but I had a doctor, not Dr.

1258
05:14:13,750 --> 05:14:21,860
Oakhurst. I had, what the hell, DiGiorno's, DiGiorno's stuffed cross pepperoni pizza.

1259
05:14:21,860 --> 05:14:46,060
That's very high. It's, it's exceptionally high. You guys hang out there for now. Um,

1260
05:14:46,380 --> 05:15:05,799
I guess I'll do another one over here. Should I not be putting the solar shield on everything?

1261
05:15:05,799 --> 05:15:26,889
I feel like I shouldn't be. They eat meat. Oh shit. The chickens. I put them in the wrong spot. Um,

1262
05:15:26,889 --> 05:15:59,110
okay. Uh, hold on. I'm going to transfer them here. Okay. I got to hold on. I'm going to do

1263
05:15:59,110 --> 05:16:21,509
a huge chicken transfer. Yeah. DiGiorno's stuffed crust pizzas. Phenomenal. Uh, the red Baron French

1264
05:16:21,509 --> 05:16:31,990
bread pizzas. That's like a high nine. All right. Now we can clean this out a little bit. That's

1265
05:16:31,990 --> 05:16:45,560
better. All right. Very good. Let's go dump all these in the other one. You've never had a French

1266
05:16:45,560 --> 05:16:53,830
bread pizza. Oh, it's so good. It's so good. That red Baron Supreme French bread pizza from the other

1267
05:16:53,830 --> 05:17:02,680
night. Jesus. That was, that was, that was close to a 10. That was like a 9.5. It was unbelievably

1268
05:17:02,680 --> 05:17:28,090
good. Where's the audio? All right. I got food. Maybe a little bit more. Those are going to be

1269
05:17:28,090 --> 05:17:44,709
worth a lot too. Those plorts. Do you guys eat meat, fruits? All right. Well here, eat these.

1270
05:17:44,709 --> 05:17:58,919
You guys good? Okay. I need to kind of sneak in here and grab these.

1271
05:18:09,369 --> 05:18:30,500
Cool. I think I should do, these two are going to be worth a lot right now, right? I think I'm

1272
05:18:30,500 --> 05:18:48,619
just going to combine these. Why not? Is that a bad idea? Anyone disagree? I'm just going to do it.

1273
05:18:48,619 --> 05:19:03,259
Don't they need light protection? Um, I don't think they do. Okay. Let's just do that. Cool. Whoa.

1274
05:19:04,419 --> 05:19:28,939
What? That was cool. So when do they, um, when do they stop doing that? It's dead? Oh, it needs to

1275
05:19:28,939 --> 05:19:35,430
be nighttime. Oh shit. Okay. Oh fuck. All right. I'll be back. I'll be right back. I'll be right

1276
05:19:35,430 --> 05:19:51,479
back. Well, the reason why I want to combine them is because when I feed them, I'll get both

1277
05:19:51,479 --> 05:20:07,099
ports, which is a huge deal. How much are these angler ones worth? 50? Oh yeah. All right. I'll

1278
05:20:07,099 --> 05:20:18,200
feed everybody. Hold on. I want them to feed. Uh, Oh God. They've been eating in days or something.

1279
05:20:18,200 --> 05:21:03,450
This is bad. Okay. Oh yeah. Okay. Oh, they say these guys eat fruit, right? Yep. Okay. Now who

1280
05:21:03,450 --> 05:21:30,060
eats the vegetables? These guys? What do you guys eat? Vegetables? Shit. I just used them all. You

1281
05:21:30,060 --> 05:21:45,240
guys eat fruit? Okay. Time to make some money. Goodness. All right. All right. All right. All

1282
05:21:45,240 --> 05:22:06,040
right. Um, hold on. You eat chickens or something, right? You guys are good. 61. Oh my God. Okay.

1283
05:22:08,520 --> 05:22:39,240
Uh, shit. Okay. I've got a really big overload here. Fuck. There's so many things to collect.

1284
05:22:39,240 --> 05:23:01,939
Okay. He's getting overwhelmed by a kid's game. This is not, I'm not, I, I'm going to stop talking.

1285
05:23:01,939 --> 05:23:48,099
I'm going to store the rest of these. Okay. What else is over here? We have these. Cool. All right.

1286
05:23:48,099 --> 05:24:14,619
Everybody good. If I took you to a casino and I gave you a hundred thousand dollars, what would

1287
05:24:14,619 --> 05:24:20,889
be the best game to triple your money in an hour? Uh, I would say do not go in the casino. Uh, use

1288
05:24:20,889 --> 05:24:29,619
that money to start like a business or like invest in, you know, skills or education or something.

1289
05:24:29,619 --> 05:24:37,159
No, I would not take that to a casino. I would, I would, I would walk out of the casino with that

1290
05:24:37,159 --> 05:24:45,770
money. That's probably a bad idea. Now you want to drop 500 at the blackjack table, smoke a cigar,

1291
05:24:45,770 --> 05:24:50,009
have a fucking vodka pineapple. That's up to you. I don't think I would do more than that though.

1292
05:24:59,180 --> 05:25:16,729
Lame vodka pineapple is, um, it's that that's the drink.

1293
05:25:18,650 --> 05:25:24,250
Everybody sleeps on the vodka pineapple till they drink it and they go, wow. Okay. Never mind.

1294
05:25:25,459 --> 05:25:28,180
Every other thing I've ever had is like, why would I ever have it ever again?

1295
05:25:32,180 --> 05:25:34,979
It's smooth. It's loaded with vitamin C.

1296
05:25:54,709 --> 05:26:13,659
Not pineapples. I didn't, that's not what I said. All right. Sell it. All right.

1297
05:26:13,659 --> 05:26:22,360
I have 3,600 bucks. I can, I'm going to bring the, somebody needs fruit. Who wants it?

1298
05:26:23,500 --> 05:26:29,880
Does somebody need fruit? I'm very simple when it comes to alcohol. Incredibly simple.

1299
05:26:31,619 --> 05:26:37,860
I don't want any, I don't, I don't, I'm not into like the marshmallow toasted almond vodka. No,

1300
05:26:37,860 --> 05:26:42,060
no, no, no. Just, just give me, I just want a vodka pineapple, a vodka cranberry,

1301
05:26:42,939 --> 05:26:47,099
or just like two fingers of whiskey. Like I got one that I like. That's it.

1302
05:26:49,979 --> 05:27:13,689
I only drink like a few times every few months. There's a never-ending supply here. Okay. Um,

1303
05:27:14,939 --> 05:27:26,740
load the, load this. Don't sleep on 1800 coconut tequila. I haven't, I'm not really a big tequila

1304
05:27:26,740 --> 05:27:33,450
guy, but if I'm ever in the tequila mood, I'll definitely, I would definitely check it out.

1305
05:27:34,169 --> 05:27:46,419
All right. Everyone's good. Everyone's good. Everybody likes tequila. Um, I'm not a big, no,

1306
05:27:46,659 --> 05:28:03,000
not margaritas, no. If you could invent a cocktail that would be named after you, what would it be?

1307
05:28:03,000 --> 05:28:12,889
Uh, Blue Gatorade. One, one, one and a half ounces of vodka. Blue Gatorade. Um, Jolly Rancher.

1308
05:28:13,529 --> 05:28:40,569
On the bottom. Um, two Green Apple Jolly Ranchers. And hold on. No, but I'm kidding. Are you serious?

1309
05:28:40,569 --> 05:28:45,610
No, my favorite drink that would be named, would just be, this is, it would be called the, the,

1310
05:28:47,000 --> 05:28:56,150
just drink it. Just drink it. I just feel like just drink it. That's it. And it would just be,

1311
05:28:56,150 --> 05:29:01,000
oh, what do you got? I've just vodka and pineapple. Just drink it. It's good. Just sip on it. It's

1312
05:29:01,000 --> 05:29:23,450
good. You don't need anything special. Why am I holding 25 fruits? Are they getting out?

1313
05:29:23,450 --> 05:30:03,909
Don't listen to German 985. We suggest the German 985. 12 ounces of rum, 12 ounces,

1314
05:30:03,909 --> 05:30:07,270
monster energy drink, combined in shaker and strain into a cocktail glass. That's,

1315
05:30:07,270 --> 05:30:22,229
I would not drink that. I don't know. The whole energy drink and alcohol thing to me is just,

1316
05:30:22,229 --> 05:30:35,259
just headache fluid. Uh-uh. It's just, I just, I'm just going to get a headache.

1317
05:30:35,259 --> 05:30:59,220
I never got into that. Too headache-y. Red Bull vodka. Yeah, but no, nah, nah, not me. I'm not

1318
05:30:59,220 --> 05:31:17,159
into it. It just makes me feel fucking crazy. I just don't like it. Everybody good? I think

1319
05:31:17,159 --> 05:31:29,180
everybody's good. Favorite subway order? That's a Meatball Marinara Sub. Large, no bullshit.

1320
05:31:30,869 --> 05:31:35,689
Just a large 12 inch meatball sub with just regular ass provolone cheese on it.

1321
05:31:35,689 --> 05:31:46,759
Nothing else. Don't put anything else on it. That's it. That's the one thing that I like at

1322
05:31:46,759 --> 05:31:58,919
Subway for real. Subway meatballs are F. That's it. They're okay. I haven't had one in a long time.

1323
05:32:09,990 --> 05:32:16,619
Sandwich tier list. Look, if you guys get me that interesting tier list, I'll do them. But I don't

1324
05:32:16,619 --> 05:32:20,630
want somebody to be like, Oh, Hey dude, do a sandwich tier list. Use this one. And it's like

1325
05:32:21,540 --> 05:32:28,970
a JPG's of like two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, a ham and cheese, a meatball sub

1326
05:32:28,970 --> 05:32:33,720
and a steak. They got to be substantial and it has to be a lot on it. They got to be a lot of

1327
05:32:33,720 --> 05:32:39,130
variety. I got to do the, they got to be good. It has to be like a decent tier list.

1328
05:32:47,049 --> 05:32:56,779
All right. I'm going to feed the other over here one more time. I did a sandwich

1329
05:32:56,779 --> 05:33:07,259
tier. Yeah, I did one already. I think I've done pretty much all of them that you can do.

1330
05:33:07,259 --> 05:33:14,619
We're going to start reaching here. Yeah. Once we start reaching to, uh, what is Donald Duck's

1331
05:33:14,619 --> 05:33:44,740
favorite sandwiches tier list? You know that we're kind of past doing them anymore.

1332
05:33:44,740 --> 05:33:53,000
Sell this. That should do it for a little bit. Firehouse is solid. Firehouse is all right. It's

1333
05:33:53,000 --> 05:34:01,159
good. What's the, uh, the Turkey one? They have, uh, it's like a Turkey. I think it's called the

1334
05:34:01,159 --> 05:34:07,700
ladder. It's whatever the ladder is. It's like a Turkey and peppers or something. The engineer,

1335
05:34:10,650 --> 05:34:16,900
the hook and ladder. Yeah. What's that one? I think that's the one that I get.

1336
05:34:16,900 --> 05:34:27,500
It's Turkey and ham. Yeah. Whatever that one is, it's good. Firehouse is fine.

1337
05:34:27,500 --> 05:34:41,880
I don't have a problem. Firehouse is good. What slimes are those? These are, um, angler slimes

1338
05:34:42,840 --> 05:34:51,830
and I combined them with the tail ringtail slime. So now they are happy raccoon angler.

1339
05:34:51,830 --> 05:34:58,099
Well, they're very, they're very unhappy. It seems they're very angry with me. They want to attack.

1340
05:34:58,099 --> 05:35:16,099
It's okay though. They're cute. Yeah, they are. The person with the coffee pasta that ended like

1341
05:35:16,099 --> 05:35:28,869
40 minutes ago, dude, are you, do you have like 60,000 ping? That was just, it just came up again.

1342
05:35:28,869 --> 05:35:37,259
I look over and it's like 40 minutes have gone by and I see, oh, hey dude, I'm a big fan. But like

1343
05:35:37,259 --> 05:35:43,909
you cool ranch Dorito farts or something. It's like, man, we, we were over that already. Okay.

1344
05:35:43,909 --> 05:35:54,549
You're about, I'm drunk. Um, well, just relax, drink some water, stop drinking. Now you got,

1345
05:35:54,549 --> 05:36:00,630
I got to give you guys the strat here. The drinking strat, trust me, please listen to me.

1346
05:36:02,330 --> 05:36:10,840
Stop drinking after midnight. It's treated like gremlin shit. Stop drinking after like 1150.

1347
05:36:11,770 --> 05:36:18,700
No, don't drink anything else. You're done. Drink water for the rest of the night and you'll be,

1348
05:36:18,700 --> 05:36:24,950
you'll feel in the morning, you're going to feel way better. Do not sit there and stare at that

1349
05:36:24,950 --> 05:36:35,450
fucking 1245 AM shot. Yeah. Okay. Um, maybe not. Yeah. Nope. Put it down. Put it down.

1350
05:36:35,450 --> 05:36:43,139
Seriously. Put it down. That one AM shot of fucking Jack Daniels. Don't do it. You're not

1351
05:36:43,139 --> 05:36:45,459
going to want to do that. You're going to wake up in the morning. You're going to be like,

1352
05:36:45,459 --> 05:36:51,060
why the fuck did I do that? It was the shot of Jack. You're going to be able to rewind and go

1353
05:36:51,060 --> 05:36:57,540
the shot of Jack Daniels at 145 is what fucked me up bad and put me over the edge.

1354
05:37:01,500 --> 05:37:11,849
At about 1215, you should treat alcohol like you're a gremlin and just start doing,

1355
05:37:11,849 --> 05:37:18,900
start doing water. Cause no, what, what, what like happens at two o'clock in the morning?

1356
05:37:19,779 --> 05:37:35,799
Nothing. Fuck that. No, no, I don't know at like two, three plus AM it's no after midnight.

1357
05:37:37,400 --> 05:37:41,240
It's like the let's let's it's time to end the party here.

1358
05:37:41,240 --> 05:37:47,060
So if you're sitting there and it's like, you know, 1231 AM right now and it's like,

1359
05:37:47,380 --> 05:37:58,700
I'm on Pacific. So I don't know where you are, but 1230, one AM, no more. What happens at two AM?

1360
05:37:58,700 --> 05:38:06,520
I joined a stream and asked where the, wait, what with the nearest barbecue? I don't know.

1361
05:38:06,520 --> 05:38:18,250
I couldn't even read what he said. Drinking is for nighttime though. Yeah. You got a solid.

1362
05:38:18,250 --> 05:38:22,580
All right. If you, if you start, oh, I'm going to have some drinks tonight.

1363
05:38:22,580 --> 05:38:25,060
Maybe I'm going to go with some friends. What am I going to do? I'm going to go do something.

1364
05:38:25,060 --> 05:38:29,380
Right. There's been plenty of opportunity to do that. I do it. People come to Vegas a lot.

1365
05:38:29,380 --> 05:38:35,159
And it's like, oh, let's go do something. You cross that threshold of, you've got like from,

1366
05:38:35,159 --> 05:38:44,630
from like seven to eight PM to like one AM. You started about like six straight hours of drinking.

1367
05:38:44,630 --> 05:38:51,860
That's where you need, you need to be. That's gotten at that point. You're kind of, you're good.

1368
05:38:57,099 --> 05:39:01,419
What am I talking about? Talking about drinking after midnight or drinking after one AM or after

1369
05:39:01,419 --> 05:39:18,569
two, after one 30 boomer goes out at six and is what, no, I didn't say that. I didn't say that.

1370
05:39:18,569 --> 05:39:24,729
Okay. At midnight, you don't have to go. Well, fellas, it's 12 o'clock. And if I don't get home,

1371
05:39:24,729 --> 05:39:30,810
I'll turn it to a pumpkin, right? You don't have to do that. You just stay out. No, you can,

1372
05:39:30,810 --> 05:39:44,889
you can hang out still backtracking Barry. No, that's not, I didn't say you had to leave.

1373
05:39:45,529 --> 05:39:52,569
I didn't say you had to like, if you're, I didn't say you had to leave if, okay, if you're hanging

1374
05:39:52,569 --> 05:39:57,669
out with friends at like a buddy's house and it's like, you don't have to just leave, stay,

1375
05:39:58,470 --> 05:40:07,110
just don't drink after 12 30 after one 30. It's okay. It's like, it's like a calm cast guy window

1376
05:40:07,750 --> 05:40:30,500
between 12 and one 30. They go and take a fucking lift takeovers. Don't, don't be a fucking idiot.

1377
05:40:31,139 --> 05:40:46,119
For the love of God, for the love of God, please. All right. Why was he screaming at us? I wasn't

1378
05:40:46,119 --> 05:41:02,889
screaming at you. Drink some water for eight hours on a stream. I mean, I kind of do that already.

1379
05:41:08,680 --> 05:41:11,799
Yeah. I'm not going to tell you how you should drink if you're of the age to drink.

1380
05:41:12,520 --> 05:41:19,049
Just be careful. Look, I'm 37. Okay. Listen to me. I'm, I'm listening to me. I'm your goddamn

1381
05:41:19,049 --> 05:41:27,319
grandpa. Okay. I'm your goddamn grandpa. Listen to your grandpa. All right. So I've walked in a

1382
05:41:27,319 --> 05:41:33,509
circle for, you know, 10 straight minutes. That's how we know that time to probably turn the stream

1383
05:41:33,509 --> 05:41:41,020
off. I did the build the Minecraft wall and take the Minecraft wall down 10 times while we talked

1384
05:41:41,020 --> 05:42:09,290
about something. You're 37 omega low. Oh, come on. He's a rambling old man now. What? All right. This

1385
05:42:09,290 --> 05:42:15,930
game is really fun. We might pick this back up again. I definitely want to, I want to do Breath

1386
05:42:15,930 --> 05:42:28,869
of the Wild tomorrow though, between 12 and one 30. That's it. Vodka pineapple, vodka cranberry,

1387
05:42:28,869 --> 05:42:41,799
good whiskey, and just drink responsibly. It makes me old man. All right. I'll see you guys

1388
05:42:41,799 --> 05:42:57,450
tomorrow. Breath of the Wild will start probably closer to three tomorrow, not two. So that's what

1389
05:42:57,450 --> 05:43:00,409
we're going to do. Breath of the Wild. We'll continue playing it. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1390
05:43:00,409 --> 05:43:05,720
Thanks for watching. This has been Slime Rancher 2. It's been, it's good. It's kind of just Slime

1391
05:43:05,720 --> 05:43:13,290
Rancher 1 again, but it, it feels like they, they just, they have Slime Rancher 1 and they're like,

1392
05:43:13,290 --> 05:43:19,240
let's just make that again and put a bunch of other shit in it. So, and that's not a complaint.

1393
05:43:19,240 --> 05:43:43,349
Like I said, it, it's great to get more of that game. So anyways, uh, hold on a second. Is,

1394
05:43:51,430 --> 05:44:12,470
is the Vinesauce stuff going on right now? Is Joel, Joel going right now? All right. Cool.

1395
05:44:12,470 --> 05:44:18,310
I believe, I think Joel and all the rest of the Vinesauce crew there, I think they're doing a

1396
05:44:18,310 --> 05:44:34,150
charity event right now. I'm going to raid Joel. Yeah. Let's, let's, uh, go say hello,

1397
05:44:34,150 --> 05:44:43,500
go support, uh, go support their, uh, streams and everything they do inside. It's called Stream of

1398
05:44:43,500 --> 05:44:51,000
Conscious, uh, for St. Jude's Children Hospital. And I believe he's doing Vine Wrestle. So, I mean,

1399
05:44:51,000 --> 05:44:58,680
like go enjoy that. That's always a treat. All right. I will see you guys later. Thanks for

1400
05:44:58,680 --> 05:45:08,569
watching everybody. Take care of yourselves today. It was kind of an unhinged stream today,

1401
05:45:08,569 --> 05:45:26,869
but whatever. Sometimes it just happens. It wasn't too weird. I mean, it was kind of weird

1402
05:45:26,869 --> 05:45:47,419
eating a meal, succulent Chinese meal. Yeah. I'll see you guys later. Breath of the Wild tomorrow.

1403
05:45:47,419 --> 05:45:51,419
Good night. Goodbye. 3 PM Pacific. Mark it on your calendar, even though it's tomorrow.

1404
05:45:51,419 --> 05:46:08,869
Take care of yourselves. Good night. And please behave over on Joel's channel. I will be very

1405
05:46:08,869 --> 05:46:13,700
upset if I hear that either you were misbehaving. I will actually be annoyed by it. Don't misbehave.

1406
05:46:14,099 --> 05:46:21,450
Be good. Be nice. Be supportive. Or I'm going to be very upset. You understand? I'm going to

1407
05:46:21,450 --> 05:46:33,740
be very upset about it. And I'll, I don't know. I'll be told. Take it easy.
