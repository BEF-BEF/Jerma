1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,080
Hello. Yeah, sorry about that. I was, I was ready to go.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,939
Uh, but, uh, Mr. Otto, I did the thing where he runs around in a circle,

3
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:17,420
sprints, dive bombs your knees, says, get me outside now.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,460
I did. Being early yesterday really took it out of him.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,420
You're a baby? I'm not the baby. I'm taking care of my baby, Otto.

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:43,659
Did you understand? Oh, pounded. You got it.

7
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,009
All right. Yeah. So it's a day. I tweeted. We're good. I'm probably

8
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,250
talking to you. Look at my tweet was ready. My tweet went up before the stream went up.

9
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:03,750
That's how, you know, I was ready. Every other stream, I sit there, I press live and I go,

10
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,540
I forgot to tweet. Hold on. Give me a second. That's my proof to you that I was ready.

11
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:17,430
But we're going to do no more heroes three finale today. I believe there's only about

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,200
two or three more hours left in the game. And then from there, we're going to move back to

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:35,420
WarioWare. Hopefully get to level 50 in super hard. You said Spore? Oh, you're talking about

14
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:44,150
the title. It does say, it does say like Spore save file. Okay, maybe I should change that.

15
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:49,909
It says Suda 51's Spore save file. But that's like a reference to like how

16
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,390
fucked up this game is and all the characters are like Spore characters and like WWE 2K characters.

17
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,670
That was, that was a joke. Is it misleading? All right. I'll change it. I'll change it. I'll change

18
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,879
it. I'll change it. That's, is that misleading? You think it's, is it too misleading? That was a

19
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:12,539
joke we made like a week ago. How about, how about I, okay, how about this? I got it. I got it. I got

20
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:20,460
it. I got the fix. How about I change the title to what I imagine Suda 51 Spore save file looks like?

21
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:30,379
That's so wordy. I actually kind of like it. Yeah, I like that. I like that. It sucks.

22
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,750
We just play Spore. I'm going to put what I am. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I got it. Don't worry.

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:50,550
Why can't I change the title? I can't change the title of my own stream. Why? I don't understand.

24
00:02:51,750 --> 00:03:01,159
Edit stream info is grayed out. What is, okay. I just hit, I just pressed the cancel button. I

25
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,139
don't know that I, what happened? Did something happen? It was just a cancel button that I could

26
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:13,780
press on the top of my screen and I just pressed cancel. Let's just log off. I don't have no idea.

27
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:22,710
Here we go. Okay. Here we go. How about here? What I imagine Suda 51 Spore save file

28
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:43,189
looks like there. Are you happy? I like that. I like that. All right, let's go.

29
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:58,919
Hey, can you not stream? Why is it in brackets? Because like that's me thinking that's,

30
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:12,550
that's what I imagine a Suda 51 Spore save file looks like that's internal monologue. Oh, don't,

31
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,149
okay. Now here we go. Now you're all going to tell me you don't have an internal monologue, right?

32
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,680
Chat can't rotate a cube in their head, OmegaLul, right? Is this, are we going to go down this road,

33
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:38,550
this road again? If they laugh. All right, let's go. A title's fixed. It's fine.

34
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:47,829
Suda 51 Spore save, but everyone was like, holy shit, how did you get that? What? It was a,

35
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:53,060
whatever. All right, we're going back. All right, let's play. By the way, I need to make this really

36
00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:00,519
clear. This is the end of the game. If you are very excited to get your hands on No More Heroes 3

37
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:06,180
eventually, you're about to see the last third of the whole game. I just want to make that really

38
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:24,339
clear. You ready? Okay. And then after this, we are going to go to, I almost said No More Heroes,

39
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:30,220
but that's what we're doing right now. WarioWare on the same console. It'll be a very easy switch.

40
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:40,519
Okay. So, uh, first things first, I'm going to try to get to at least 20.

41
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:49,899
Because I had 20 before. This just is WarioWare. I might as well just be playing WarioWare again.

42
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,779
Those of you asking for a face cam? Nope. It's not going on until WarioWare.

43
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:03,459
Maybe if you're good, it'll turn on once this stream here for the next like two hours.

44
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:09,860
Dude, you forgot to start streaming.

45
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:17,850
Face cam on no balls. That doesn't matter. I don't care.

46
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,290
Face cam does not matter to me. It's not going on.

47
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:34,649
What if I say please? Okay. Okay. They said please. They did. You did. You said please.

48
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,129
That one person said please. In the sea of demanding chatters.

49
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,589
There you go.

50
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,550
We're going back to 2012, German, when I wore just muscle shirts every day. Remember that?

51
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:06,899
Remember that, Ark? It's coming back. By the way, you get this until this minigame is over.

52
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,300
This is boring. Oh, that was, that was not you guys saying that. That was the game saying that.

53
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,899
Face cam's going off. Thanks, everybody. Now we're gonna play the game.

54
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:38,870
Just have to get ready. I got 20 points in that. It doesn't matter. What was the last thing we

55
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:47,430
were just doing in No More Heroes 3? How much money do I have? Alright, I just had done the

56
00:07:47,430 --> 00:08:01,240
last thing. So let's go. We're out with the beard. No, the beard actually has to get shaved tonight.

57
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,519
The only reason why I didn't do it last night or the night before is because I knew I was

58
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,000
gonna probably have the face cam on for a portion of the screen. And as you all know,

59
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,800
I don't like the way that I look with a clean shaved face. I don't like it. It makes me look

60
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,240
weird. So I have this rule where I am not, and this is, I'm not kidding. People think this is a

61
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,879
joke, but there's a lot of new viewers. I need to make sure that new viewers know this too.

62
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:31,769
I only go into public and I only show my face to people after two days have gone by after shaving

63
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:39,370
my face. So I have, I plan my get togethers around if two days will have gone by after shaving.

64
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,440
So if I, let's say I get invited to do something. Hey man, you, uh, what are you up to on Saturday

65
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,779
night? And it's Friday, like Friday afternoon. I'm like, oh, um, I got some, yeah, I got some stuff

66
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,860
going on. Oh, you sure? You don't want to? No, I got some stuff going on. Sorry. What are you doing

67
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,620
on Sunday night or Monday afternoon? Uh, nothing. Perfect. I'm going to be free on Monday afternoon.

68
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:15,419
Exactly two to three days after shaving conventions and meet like get togethers and meetups.

69
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:22,679
Every time a Twitch con happened or every time like a PAX would happen, I would shave. Okay. So

70
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:29,240
on day one of a PAX, right? Most people are kind of coming in and people aren't necessarily

71
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,000
seeing each other. It's like, oh, you come in, you travel. It's a travel day. Everyone's like,

72
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,279
I'm going to get in. It's going to be like eight o'clock. I'm sleeping and asleep at the hotel.

73
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:40,600
I would shave that morning because it was guaranteed. I wasn't going to see anybody,

74
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
except like whatever people on the plane, but I don't care. And then like a full day would

75
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,480
go by day one. Like that's day zero packs. Like day one of packs will be one full day.

76
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,320
I know that all the people do stuff on the Saturday nights, which would be two full days.

77
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,500
So therefore, like for the actual time when I know I'm going to see people, I look at my,

78
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,460
I look my best two full days go by. I get that slight five o'clock shadow. Go watch the dollhouse

79
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,259
streams. Go turn on day one of the dollhouse streams. That was exactly 48 hours to the moment

80
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:18,120
the stream started that I shaved. Just get a trimmer. No, I can't get it. I don't like

81
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,440
trimmers. Trimmers make me break out bad. I've tried to use an electric. And by the way, half

82
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,730
the time those things don't even fucking do anything. I have had nice beard trimmers and

83
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,570
electric razors. You just, you have your face as a hair minefield. They don't do anything. I've

84
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:45,929
never had one that actually works well. I will go by and it's like, okay, there's still all the

85
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,330
hair is still there. And now my face just is stinging hurts. And I'm going to have like a

86
00:10:50,330 --> 00:11:03,139
breakout tomorrow. I've tried every kind of, I've tried it every time. Is this the, have I done this

87
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:22,009
one? Just get a beard. No, I can't grow beards. I have to, it has to be two days without shaving.

88
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:24,169
And then it's perfect.

89
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:53,700
It's a pretty good song for this. Oh, got it. Shave on screen. I already did.

90
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,940
By the way, I'm in one of those moods again today. I don't know what it is.

91
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:34,149
Um, where is it? There it is. Trash. Trash. Come on. Trash. Trash. There's still trash over here.

92
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,470
Oh my God. I don't like these missions. These are my least favorite.

93
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:56,899
These are my least favorite missions in the whole game. Where is it? Come on.

94
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:17,299
That's gotta be close, right? Well, I didn't get it all. I didn't get it all. Whatever. These,

95
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:20,940
I don't like these ones. You see that? I'm trying to make money.

96
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:38,309
Bronze. Whatever. It's money. That's money. If level three opens up, I just really don't want

97
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:41,350
to do it as much as I love this game. And I love like completing a lot of the stuff. Yeah.

98
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,539
Anuvala. Whatever. I'll do it. Fine. It's right here. I don't care. I'm going to pay attention to

99
00:13:47,539 --> 00:14:09,509
this. Does that mean that there's one hidden somewhere? I don't get it. I think that's what

100
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:27,220
that means. That sucks. Oh, get out of here. Hey, get out. Get out. Get out.

101
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,500
No, we have to move on from that. I love that reference and it's a really funny video and it's

102
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,179
a really interesting community joke, but I can't just do the seal every day. I have to, I can't,

103
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:47,159
I got to move on. Maybe it's just so interesting that I'm allowed to do it more than once a week.

104
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,490
I don't want to go too far up because I want to just go through the middle.

105
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:07,129
What do you guys think? What's the amount of time that we're allowed to be stuck on one reference

106
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:14,169
or one joke for the streams? Now that I'm only live like once or twice a week. I think, I think

107
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:32,539
it's probably, I think it's probably two weeks, three months. I think that's too long. Where is

108
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:48,309
it? How are you ever supposed to reliably do this in this amount of time? Depends on how funny you

109
00:15:48,470 --> 00:16:00,090
think it is. That's a good point. You're right. Aaron should be forever. Aaron was not,

110
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:07,620
Aaron was supposed to be like a day. Aaron way overstayed its welcome and became something that

111
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:15,480
you guys now actually want to hear all the time, which is bizarre to me. And Lala too. I, people,

112
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,080
people unsubscribe because of Lala. You understand that? Do you know that that happened?

113
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:44,149
Liz almost lost. Three, two, one. I don't care if it's bronze. I'm just trying to get through them.

114
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:53,450
Get the non-believers out of here. I just want the metal so I can unlock the next level.

115
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:07,980
3,500. Nice. Level four. No. All right. I don't need to do it again.

116
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:22,680
Bronze. All right. Is there anything else I can do? What, what do we got going on here?

117
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,809
Head to the Thunderdome. Okay. Fine. I'm just trying to make a little bit of extra cash before

118
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:42,339
we go. Thunderdome. Remember, can a kangaroo walk backwards? Probably hop backwards. Shortcut.

119
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:59,019
Maybe. Or can they? I don't know. I have no idea. All right. Back in the Thunderdome. All right.

120
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,420
Head to the, head to the Thunderdome. Find it. Okay. We just have to do designated matches.

121
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:07,420
I got to remember how to play the video game because it has been a while.

122
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:28,390
All right. Let's go to these ones up here. And for a match. This game sucks with two C's. Can

123
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,750
I ask you guys something? I think we have a fairly, there's a fairly large zoomer population here,

124
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:42,329
I think, right? What do you, as the potential zoomer population, what, what like kind of your

125
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:48,660
generational slang or your generational terms do you not like the most? What do you think?

126
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,829
Well, like what, what's like your like genera- not even like slang, but what's your like

127
00:18:51,829 --> 00:19:12,230
generational thing that you guys have that you like the least? Lit. Fringe. Suss. Fortnite. Suss.

128
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,829
I'm not sure Suss will continue to, I don't know. I don't think Suss will live as long as

129
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:28,660
we think it will. Remember how to play the game Andy, right? That's not even a place where that

130
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:38,789
works. Hey, you know what my favorite is? My favorite is Andy. That's my favorite. I have

131
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:47,849
like a powerful move right now. Oh my goodness. We're about to kill everybody in the room.

132
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,190
Right, I have these moves. Okay, cool. Game's a little loud, I think, isn't it?

133
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:10,170
Andy. Oh my god, I got it again. Full green mode. All right, I gotta get in the middle.

134
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:22,839
Everybody can see me. And, ha! It's you. You gotta be the worst. What are you talking about?

135
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:32,140
What are you, hold on. I'm, you just threw me off big time right now. What do you mean? I just

136
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:45,700
freaked out. What are you talking about? Me? I'm the worst zoomer thing? Is that technically true?

137
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,920
You got me all fucked up right now. That's technically a true statement.

138
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:10,809
Ego obliterated. I'm, oh, I'm dead. I, you just really screwed my whole thing up here.

139
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,579
You just shattered my entire world view of everything. Let me turn the game down a little.

140
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:33,109
What the fuck? Damn, that's based. I don't think based is a zoomer thing. I think that was around

141
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:39,670
when, like, more than 10 years ago, wasn't it? All right, let me get back into this.

142
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,559
Sussy Baka is the worst one.

143
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,769
Why is it giving this shit to me? Why is it giving this to me? I must be really mad that I'm, like,

144
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:10,039
doing so poorly. Based is old. Yeah, based is really old. Based is not even, like, in the last

145
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:43,700
10 years. He's not dead? What just happened? Based based cringe cringe. That was $10,000 for that?

146
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:55,930
What the hell? Onions, onions. All right, dude, I think we need a rock out break. It's been

147
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:08,809
15 minutes. I'm, I think I'm gonna be fine. I think I'm gonna be okay. There's a bike there.

148
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:28,779
And we're off. I thought I could drive over that. You know, I want there to be studies done on

149
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:37,509
things. Like, for instance, has, is pepperoni, like, has there been a percentile lossage in

150
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:41,269
if pepperoni is everyone's favorite topping generation to generation? You know what I mean?

151
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:48,140
Like, okay, from boomers to millennial to zoomers, is pepperoni, do we lose any percentage points?

152
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:52,710
What's, like, your, what's a zoomer's, like, favorite pizza topping, right?

153
00:23:53,269 --> 00:24:03,109
Like, what's a millennial's favorite pizza topping? Is it, is it, is that universally,

154
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:10,700
like, the best pizza topping that everyone agrees on? I wonder. That's, that stuff kind of intrigues

155
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:36,839
me. Black olives? Because, like, those tastes don't change. Like, pepperoni universally, like,

156
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,680
80% of people like on their pizza. Like, doesn't matter what generation or who you are, where you

157
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:55,049
are. That's interesting, isn't it? Three of these guys. All right, I gotta pay attention.

158
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:15,559
These guys are horrible. These guys are the worst enemy. Jesus. I can't see. I've been jumping

159
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:25,619
around. It freaks me out. I don't like the jumping. I feel like, I feel like I just played,

160
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:34,779
I'm in a game of Overwatch right there. Do we talk about particle effects in games and how,

161
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:42,579
like, they've gone way too overboard? Have we talked about that yet? I know that I've talked

162
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:51,720
about that. Like, I want less particle effects in video games, not more. I'm fucking dead.

163
00:25:52,599 --> 00:26:01,269
Those guys, I was on the ground. I just got combo'd. All right, this is a good warm-up

164
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,750
period. I'm just warming up. I haven't played this game in like a week. Give me a break.

165
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:26,440
Wait. All right, that's better.

166
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:41,079
Come on. Come in. Come on. Wait. Wait, miss? What happened?

167
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:58,359
Get over here. Anyways, what was it? Oh, yeah. Particle effects in video games.

168
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,660
There was, for some reason, a trend started happening in the last 10 years

169
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,900
that I'm really not a fan of. And it's when particle effects take over the entire video

170
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:12,579
game. I'm going to say something here that it's going to make a lot of people probably upset.

171
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,339
I don't know. It might. Because I don't think I've talked about this specific instance in this.

172
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,220
I just remember...

173
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,079
Personal opinion. Personal opinion. This is not... I don't... I think it's a great series.

174
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,640
It's an incredible franchise. I love it. I've played hundreds, if not potentially thousands

175
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,599
of hours of this franchise. I'm going to die if I stop talking. I'll talk about it after.

176
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,200
I'm going to die. And it's going to be your... No, it's not. It's my fault.

177
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:52,309
I brought this up. It's not your fault. Okay. Anyways, listen to me. So, Super Smash Brothers,

178
00:27:53,910 --> 00:28:00,069
the new iterations of the game, the last two iterations, the particle effects are so

179
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:06,390
outrageous to me in my brain. Like punching and kicking and jumping. They like these huge,

180
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:16,549
massive particle effects. I like the game. I think it's a really great game. But every time

181
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:21,750
I punch and kick somebody, it's like... You see these giant flashing clouds appear over everybody's

182
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:36,170
head. It's almost hard sometimes to see. Like, okay, I'm doing a combo. I see these two or three

183
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:45,079
giant flashes of big bright clouds of sparkles and explosions over people. I want less. And now

184
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,240
that I said that, I'm sorry that I just... People that are going to... If you play that game and

185
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,000
you're a fan of it, you're now going to see what I'm talking about. And I may have just fucked up

186
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:11,240
your entire view of that game. I'm sorry. I think that's why I like the Souls series.

187
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,210
You may have just come up with the reason why, even though those games are kind of hard

188
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:22,410
and somewhat frustrating and annoying to me, that it is one of my favorite franchises ever.

189
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:31,849
That's a really good point. Because there's no extra shit added on those games. If I punch

190
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:40,890
somebody or if I slash somebody with a sword in Dark Souls, the sword just hits them. A gigantic

191
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,809
bright particle cloud of bright colors and explosions don't come out of their body.

192
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:55,299
I don't like that training. Over-stimulation. Yeah, it's just over-stimulating. Like,

193
00:29:55,299 --> 00:30:05,539
headache-inducing the way. It hates this game. No. This blood... Yeah, but there's a difference

194
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:13,140
between like blood coming out and like bright sparkly explosions and huge smoke particle effects

195
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:29,190
coming out when you touch somebody. I heard that Mass Effect 2 does not have that. So this is a

196
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:37,990
roundabout way of you saying that this should be blood and smash. Oh my god. I'm sorry.

197
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:53,460
I'll be really honest with you. And I have to be. Because if I'm not honest with you, then I can't

198
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,640
be honest with myself, right? If there was blood and smash besides the giant huge bright flash of

199
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,519
particle effects every time you hit somebody, I would probably like the game more. It's very

200
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:24,819
easy to say that. But no, I'm not... Listen to me. I'm not saying that I would prefer it. I'm just

201
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:31,930
saying that like there would be less on the screen. I just want less stuff on the screen when I hit

202
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:45,029
stuff. That's it. I'm going this way. He wants to see Mario bleed. No, I just want to see Mario

203
00:31:45,029 --> 00:32:06,539
have... I want less stuff on the screen. You want Mario dead. You're a psycho. I'm not though. I

204
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:12,700
know there's people here that agree with me. That want to see less obscene particle explosions

205
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,740
every time they see anything. Oh, hold on. I thought the game crashed.

206
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:32,680
I know these people agree with me. I know they're in here. Why did it happen?

207
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,460
You're literally the only one. No, I can't see.

208
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:52,779
It can't be. That's why I couldn't really... That's why I didn't care about Overwatch.

209
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,250
It's the way that you phrased it. What, because I said I would rather they be blood and smash

210
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:18,730
brothers than bright particle effects? I'm not talking about mortal combat levels of blood.

211
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,940
Oh, shit. This is bad. This is a hard place to fight everybody.

212
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:46,170
Strawberry. Yeah, be careful here. Invincible. Oh, thank God. What? Why are they staying alive

213
00:33:46,170 --> 00:34:28,230
after that? Stupid particle effects. Are these my screen? Whatever. Pretending to be bad again.

214
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:40,980
Do the mission. This is the mission. This is the game. I have to make enough money

215
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:57,099
from doing the jobs in the mission. Come on. That's so stupid. Oh, whatever. Who cares?

216
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:12,780
What else do you want blood in? I don't want blood in Smash Brothers. I just said that I prefer less

217
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:21,900
stuff on the screen. And like a blood splatter would be way less than like the smoke explosions.

218
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:26,059
Let's get this over with. You're putting words in my mouth. Stop it.

219
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,949
All right, let's kill. I gotta get rid of these guys first. These guys are the worst.

220
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:59,059
What about Wii Sports? I don't know what you're talking about. Why would they be blood in Wii

221
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:17,369
Sports? Come on. What about boxing in Wii Sports? But there's okay. Comedy violence is different

222
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:26,199
than like mature violence. Dude, Tom and Jerry. Tom used to get like a hammer smashed on his hand

223
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:33,000
and like shot in the face and stuff. Like Jerry used to fucking torture that guy. But there was

224
00:36:33,000 --> 00:37:00,420
no blood. He may have gotten like a black eye or something, right? But when Tom hit Jerry with the

225
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:16,059
hammer, sparkly, gigantic particle smoke did not come out of Tom's hand. That's the point. He got

226
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:29,000
his teeth knocked in. No, it didn't. There was no like big flash particle like camera flash

227
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,199
and like sparkles and big smoke. Boom! No, he's got his hand smashed with a hammer.

228
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,260
Okay, all right. I'm moving on from this. We've been on this for too long.

229
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:14,820
I'm gonna try to do this one again. How will you know if it's next gen if there's not millions of

230
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:23,880
particles? You know, that's probably the reason why a lot of games slow down too. Is that what

231
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,820
happened? Have we plateaued in graphics that we have not plateaued in the amount of shit that they

232
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:50,730
can put on the screen in particle effects? I think you figured it out. Style is becoming more

233
00:38:50,730 --> 00:39:07,190
important. Today is the particle rant stream. Not. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Yeah,

234
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:12,969
it takes way too long. All right. I don't want to fall in the lava, but man you got to fight

235
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:26,710
the people down there. That sucks. Is this game good? This game is very good. It's really difficult

236
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,840
for me to rate it and tell you, like, you shouldn't. This game is really not very good at all.

237
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,500
I really recommend you don't purchase it. It's probably the worst in the series, out of the three

238
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:57,210
at least, in the main series. No, it's good. It's really good. I think this is probably my favorite

239
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:11,059
one out of the three. This is my last time I'm going to try this. I've been, okay, the amount of

240
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:15,219
time I've taken trying to do this mission, I could have already made ten thousand dollars doing the

241
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:39,019
fight missions. Oh, let's not screw it up this time. Hang on, right? I don't even want to know

242
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:45,940
what level three this is, or level four. It's probably so awful. All right, nothing this way,

243
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:56,519
right? I have plenty of time. I'm not worried about the time. Move out of the fucking way.

244
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,760
All right, let's go this way.

245
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:15,719
Oh, he did a Lord of the Rings beatbox. He's done that, like, a thousand times. I've heard

246
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,599
that a million times before. He doesn't have any other material in his jukebox.

247
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:42,360
My voice is already fucked up this morning. I'm yelling at WarioWare, the 35-year-old man.

248
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,199
That's something I have to live with, you know.

249
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:56,500
About 36 yet. Stop saying that. It's not accurate yet.

250
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:05,800
All right, what about up? Yeah, there's one up there. Is there anything left over here?

251
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,780
God, I don't know. Jesus. Oh my god, it didn't register. It didn't register the click.

252
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:25,340
Holy shit. Okay, I'm good. All right, I gotta go up this way. Where is this?

253
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:43,610
Shut up. Four, okay, five, six. Don't fall in the middle. It's so easy to not fall in the middle.

254
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,469
I don't, there's no timer right now.

255
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:59,059
Goodness. Don't dodge into the fire.

256
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:15,050
I don't know. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?

257
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,420
What the fuck? All right, I'm good.

258
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,139
Five, okay, there's one more. I don't know where it is, though. Wait for this to flood.

259
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:46,070
Do I still eat dairy? Um, a little. I don't drink any real milk or anything, except for like a milkshake or ice cream or cheese.

260
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:53,050
Oh, I mean, I don't, not really. Here it is. All right, get me out of here.

261
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:03,780
Yeah, I mean, I do. I still eat dairy. It's only from cheese and ice cream, though. That's really it.

262
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:21,639
You see that? If I want, like, milk in my coffee or milk with a brownie or something,

263
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:33,480
it's usually almond milk or oat milk. One of those two. Cheese tier list? I've already

264
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:45,829
did all the tier lists. New level is unlocked. All right, let's just see what it looks like

265
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:53,980
because it's here. Oat milk is filled with canola oil. Omega-Lel. Yeah, and apples have cyanide in it.

266
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,500
Whatever. I'll see you in 10 years when they realize. See you in 25 years when drinking

267
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:13,530
coffee actually kills you. I don't care. This is the banana radiation thing again. I don't care.

268
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:21,590
Coffee's supposed to be good for your heart. Yeah, whatever. I'll see you in 50 years when

269
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:26,389
they realize that there's like a micro organism in coffee that is giving us all like diseases.

270
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,630
Okay, here's the real point. Everything sucks. Everything is bad for you. Eventually.

271
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:55,909
I canceled it. I'm good. All right, well, that was cool. I need 50,000. I do a couple more missions.

272
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:06,820
Coffee's worms. It has worms in it. Yeah, I don't know. Whatever. Here's the point. Treat your body

273
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:16,300
well with whatever data and science that we have now and that's it. Just, you know, eat what you

274
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:22,380
want. Eat whatever you feel. Do whatever you want. Moderate it. Don't be crazy. Don't be out of your

275
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:27,019
mind and like, oh, I only eat fucking McDonald's number twos. Like, don't do that. That's a dumb

276
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:35,159
thing to do. Some light exercise if you need to and you look and then in like 100 years

277
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,960
they'll look back and they'll be like, are you kidding me? They were they were putting sugar.

278
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:51,159
They were eating sugar. What were they thinking? Just wait. There will be a what were they thinking

279
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:57,559
reference for like the generations in 100 years and like, hold on a minute guys. What are you?

280
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:07,190
What are you serious? They were eating the fruits off of trees. What? No, they were not. Why would

281
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:18,739
they do that? We'll see in like 200 years. They were eating. They were eating wait meat from a cow.

282
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:22,420
What the fuck? No, they were not. I don't believe that for a second. How could they do that?

283
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:38,460
There'll be something. Just you just wait. We'll see what it is. They were drinking water.

284
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:44,739
I don't know, man. There's there'll be something that we're doing right now

285
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:48,579
that generations in the future are going to be shocked that we even thought it was a decent

286
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:53,460
idea in the first place. I don't know what it is, but we won't know.

287
00:47:55,699 --> 00:48:06,820
Oh, we've got a whole combo on them.

288
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:30,840
First down. I say I saw somebody say that oxygen was poisonous.

289
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:49,050
Um, I don't I don't want to get too into this. I don't know. I who said that? It is. I don't know.

290
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,809
That's that's an unconfirmed statement. I can't I can't agree or deny that one.

291
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:59,590
It's unconfirmed. We read that shit every day. That's unconfirmed to me. I mean, technically,

292
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:13,300
it could be. Yeah, but isn't it like a blend? Don't we have an air cocktail that's not just

293
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:18,099
oxygen? So I okay, maybe that might that might be accurate. I don't know. Yeah, we have an air

294
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:31,780
cocktail. I get it. Yeah, whatever. It's like, I don't know, like hydrogen, oxygen,

295
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,900
hydrogen, oxygen,

296
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:41,690
or ander, cadmium, whatever they are. There's all kinds of shit in our ear.

297
00:49:42,489 --> 00:50:07,190
Just said, Dude, German, you are on hard drugs. No, you are right now seeing the reason why I was

298
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:15,860
always afraid of ever doing a hard drug ever. I am completely drug free. But the exception

299
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:24,780
is Tylenol, caffeine, a little bit of marijuana. I'm feeling okay. No drug free, man. I don't.

300
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:49,590
I have no way. Don't do those all together. I'm no, I'm not. I'm I'm talking about in

301
00:50:49,590 --> 00:51:01,269
separate occasions. No, I look, you don't need more than that. Let's be really realistic here.

302
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:07,380
Really, really hard shit that like really fucks you up and stuff. No, no, just I'll just I'll

303
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,420
take a little bit of weed is fine. That's it. That's kind of I don't need alcohol, maybe a

304
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:20,300
little bit sometimes. No, that's anything more than that. No, it's not. It's not good. It's

305
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:27,610
not good for you. Fucks up. You've had screws with you. This is what like no, I need ATM.

306
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:55,400
Where's your ATM? Oh, right here. What about psychedelics? Um, I don't I don't know enough

307
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:03,800
about them. I know that there's some preliminary data right of people. There being some drug

308
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:10,039
companies or some pharmaceutical companies that are experimenting with like low dose of psychedelics

309
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:17,420
to treat some mental disorders, mental health problems, right? I don't know. I've heard that.

310
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:30,900
I don't know. We'll see in like another 20 years. What happens 15 years? I'm afraid of them and I

311
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:44,860
don't ever want to do them. They're experimenting with shrooms. I mean, I know that there is some

312
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:51,340
drug companies that are that have programs. Let's study. That's deep, man. Very, very low doses of

313
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:59,019
some psychedelics can actually help. I don't know. It's just really random shit that I have read.

314
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:12,309
I have that correct, correct, right? We used to drink this after school. Yeah, okay.

315
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:21,429
I always got muscat and you always got kyoho. The sweetness of the grape really invigorates a tired

316
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:31,369
body. It was a little treat to myself for working hard. That stuff was good. It's all coming back

317
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:39,030
to me now. So you remember things too, huh? You have like Greece and all? For most things,

318
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:46,309
I sort of have to gather the pieces together or I can't remember. I see. So you are a victim too.

319
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:49,989
In that case, can't you just give up on this planet?

320
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:58,059
Sonic? Are you being serious? Yes. I think it's worth considering.

321
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:03,019
I can't back down. You should know this. My family's destiny.

322
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:12,250
That stuff again. Is that Charles from Red Dead? It is. Same actor. That's not gonna work. I mean,

323
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:21,449
Sonic? Will not back out. I will follow your orders, but I do hope that you will back out.

324
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:34,760
Future? Can you see it? I'm not sure. I must go. What's the future like? I will tell you when I

325
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:49,800
get back. Make sure you come back, Sonic Juice. Next time, let's try some peach juice. Yeah,

326
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:58,730
I would. I can't do psychedelics. I would never do it. I like to be close to.

327
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:03,449
I don't like the idea of being able to be potentially disconnected from reality. I feel

328
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:08,170
like I would have a panic attack. I think I would have a meltdown or something. I don't know if I

329
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:16,519
could do it. No, I don't think so. And that's okay, right? That's completely fine. I don't

330
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:24,809
have to do any of those things. I know the things that I know that I can do and I can handle.

331
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:33,460
Obviously, I don't want to make sure I'm not like get hurt or hurt myself or something in the

332
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:40,409
process, right? You want to even with something like that, like marijuana or alcohol, you're

333
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:43,530
going to be careful. You don't want to just like walk up and fuck your head up and shit. And, you

334
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:47,690
know, think about I think about how many times or people, you know, have you heard of somebody

335
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:57,559
that like, you know, you drink too much, right? That's that sucks. That sucks. All these things

336
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:05,559
come with potential consequences. Just to be careful. All right. Do I have enough to do this?

337
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:21,380
I definitely do. All right. Do I care about health or damage? I feel like I'm whooping

338
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:37,260
everybody's ass. So might as well dial that up to 100. Nice. What's the best way to lose weight?

339
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:41,590
I really don't know. I've never been in that position before where I've had to.

340
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:48,139
So I'm not the one that can answer that question for you. I have enough to do this.

341
00:56:48,780 --> 00:57:12,650
Oh, I don't have enough money to buy these calories in calories out. Yeah, I was. I mean,

342
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:19,320
if I were to try to do it, which I'll be honest, probably I'm probably gonna have to do that

343
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:31,500
because I like slingshot of myself. I lost a bunch of weight a year or two ago,

344
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:37,929
all the medical bullshit. And then I gained it back. And I tried to get like on a program

345
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:46,170
to get it all back. And then it kept going. And then I kept going. So I went from 129 or

346
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:53,139
I think my lowest, I was 128 pounds. And then I went from that to like 145. And I was like,

347
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:57,539
all right, this is perfect. I'm done. I did it. And then like a couple, like three or four months

348
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:02,630
later, I looked at the scale and I was like, holy shit, I'm 163 pounds. How? When did that happen?

349
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:12,579
Like I went way too far back and way too far forward. I gained like an extra 10 pounds in

350
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:22,980
like three or four months somehow. So now I have to kind of eventually here, I got to do the pull

351
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:29,880
back where I get a little bit more physically active, some more weight training, maybe very

352
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:37,590
lightly, but it's hard because kind of chest and back problem that I have. It's kind of a pain in

353
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:43,130
the ass to exercise for more than a few times because I'll exercise and I'll be like, okay,

354
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:47,610
cool. That was a nice workout. And the next two or three days, it's like, oh my God, I can't even

355
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:52,699
move. So it's actually kind of hard to do that, but I need to get to doing some light stuff.

356
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:56,710
Maybe like kind of doing an elliptical or jogging or something just to drop a little bit of the

357
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:10,170
weight. I'm back down to like 155, 150 maybe I'll be happy at like 155. I will. You used to be so

358
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:20,840
yoked. Yeah, I was, I was, I was, I was an absolute stack of shit like 10 years ago. So I get to be

359
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,300
that person. Now that's like, Hey, you know, 10 years ago, you should have seen me. I never

360
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:32,489
didn't know what that was going to be like to actually say that. But now here we are.

361
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:43,539
That's a weird feeling. This is versus the Sonic guy. This is number three, right?

362
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:55,289
The number three ranked assassin is Sonic juice, Sonic occupation, demon God. He is known as who's

363
00:59:55,289 --> 01:00:03,369
right hand. He's like the one you to foos Liu Bei. He's even called the one you of space.

364
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:10,570
Let all your madness out, Travis. Welcome to the garden of insanity.

365
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:16,380
As long as you're healthy. Yeah, that's the point. I never want to go too far or too,

366
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:21,420
too low, right? I want to go kind of something be somewhere in the middle.

367
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:31,510
But like, look, I still, I still want to enjoy, you know, oh, I'm going to go eat out. Yeah,

368
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,670
I'll take her. I would love like a fucking nice big like juicy cheeseburger.

369
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:41,420
All right. Also like, you know, I would enjoy I'll take like a grilled chicken salad with some,

370
01:00:42,219 --> 01:00:47,820
you know, fresh greens and stuff. I just, I don't want to have anything off limits to myself.

371
01:00:47,820 --> 01:01:01,400
Right. Okay. I only have the heels. You're going to look like a boxing glove soon. I'm trying to

372
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:07,690
picture what that what you're trying to say. And I'm having trouble. Because what does that mean?

373
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:16,329
Like top heavy and like big, big, big up top and small. A boxing glove is just big all around.

374
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:31,900
Big. Remember, you have really long teeth. Can I have one of them?

375
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:42,699
The day that I like sell a tooth to a viewer is the day where I have truly it's truly over.

376
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:52,039
It's just over. And it's time to pack up shop and close the door. All right, let's do it.

377
01:01:52,760 --> 01:02:11,449
Oh, it's this guy. He's actually always inside of that thing. I didn't even know he was in there.

378
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:23,769
This is taking way too long. How long is this guy going to walk? Just be patient. Oh, it's so damn

379
01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:30,570
long. He's probably tired. For real. This is fucking long. He might be injured. Isn't this

380
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:37,289
just a huge waste of time? Just chill. Okay. We start getting antsy. We lose. What the fuck is

381
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:49,670
the point of this? He's just fucking with us now. Right. He's getting closer. This is actually

382
01:02:49,670 --> 01:03:01,590
starting to freak me out a little. Is he smoking? These are bong rips. Who's doing that? Oh, it's the

383
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:23,210
cat purring. Oh, the slowed down music. This is like a high scene. Gene, it's time. Sorry for the

384
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:31,059
wait. I'm fine. But the younger gamers don't like waiting for shit. And that five minutes probably

385
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:39,139
caused a lot of them to scrap this game. Yeah. Good point. Hey, young gamers. I'm terribly sorry.

386
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:48,469
Young gamers. You don't have to go that far. And you've probably got in cold standing out here.

387
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:53,380
Don't worry about it. I've hated the sea since I was a kid. That's all.

388
01:03:55,219 --> 01:04:04,380
Look like a warrior. So even earth has some good soldiers too. I'm no fucking soldier. I'm a goddamn

389
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:11,019
killer. Anyone getting in my way gets killed. I'm a passing assassin. I like this area. You don't

390
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:18,099
look like a bad soldier. Either way, if you're going to take us down, you must be pretty tough.

391
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:24,739
Fuck head. This ain't the pub. I didn't come here to shoot the shit with coworkers and have a few

392
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:32,820
beers after work and go home. We're going to fight to the death. Let me ask you this. Why do you want

393
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:40,260
to kill me? If you're going to fuck up my town, I don't give a shit who you are. You're my enemy.

394
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:46,500
So I got to kill you. That's all. I'll be honest with you. I don't agree with fool,

395
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:50,980
but because this planet is evil, it must be conquered and rolled over.

396
01:04:52,659 --> 01:05:03,380
But for some reason, I'm unable to find the roots of evil in your people. Join me. You may be a good

397
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:12,300
species. Join me and together we can destroy the sea. I'll never join you. Even if that were indeed

398
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:17,579
the case, I cannot deny that I am unable to ascertain the point of fighting you.

399
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:22,219
What's he got to say about it? Who do you mean by he?

400
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:33,820
Ah, you mean this. I got no idea how this works. It is an avatar, a physical and a robot.

401
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:39,579
It is an avatar. Wait, he kind of looks like avatar. Okay. I think I get it. Is this an avatar joke?

402
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:48,980
Kind of don't know then. Let us negotiate this. No need for any of that. You just get the fuck out

403
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:59,349
of this town. You willing to back off? That is going to be rather difficult. Fool is terrifying.

404
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:05,909
If I were to disobey him, my entire species would be wiped out. Airbender. No, like avatar,

405
01:06:05,909 --> 01:06:13,510
James Cameron avatar. A place as beautiful as this. This world was purged. It's civilizations

406
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:20,570
decimated. Left with nothing but a legacy of death. I guess that settles it then. We're

407
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:27,929
destined to fight. In that case, let's do it this way. I am no good with action type stuff. So

408
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:34,250
let's do this RPG style. Oh God. Why not fight in the genre of our liking, right?

409
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:45,480
Speak for yourself, buddy. I'm all action or GTFO. Now you're trying to push your own preferences on

410
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:58,389
me. Allow me to demonstrate my power. Encounter. Ah, yes. God. Right. This is how we fight. Hey,

411
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:04,949
what the hell? I can't move. What the hell is going on? Oh, come on. You're a gamer, aren't you?

412
01:07:04,949 --> 01:07:13,030
I shouldn't need to explain this to you. My beam katana won't fucking move. It's gonna be a turn

413
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:23,420
based fight. Legendary water. We got to attack with command input. We really we take turns attacking.

414
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:30,900
It's an extremely fair way to do battle. Oh, I don't like this. So this is RPG style, huh?

415
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:40,980
Maybe break my damn controller. So what? So you don't know what you're certainly behind the times.

416
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:50,380
Nope. Even if they I'm not going anywhere near it. Are they bleeping? Why not? What reason could you

417
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:57,610
have to be so stubborn about it? This must be Final Fantasy. They bleep in Final Fantasy.

418
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:16,920
You know, you're right. They look so what? I had been totally blind to that. I never noticed.

419
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:22,600
You know, but what I think really hard about it, I think it did sort of feel that way. After all,

420
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,800
I mean, all the revolutionary technology paired with the sheer branding power that is

421
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:37,380
is couldn't face the reality that the characters look absolutely. Well, don't beat yourself up

422
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:44,579
over it. It can be two things. Everyone and their mom shitty. And at the same time, the characters

423
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:52,260
do look shit. Nobody's at fault here. Not even designs are at fault. Wow. This is I feel like

424
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:59,619
this is like a shot take here. Looks like you really are a crazed psycho killer. After all,

425
01:08:59,619 --> 01:09:04,899
this is really suit of 50 ones Willy Wonka Castle. Like this is everything. Follow your lead

426
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:21,350
off to the world of RPGs. Okay, so here we go. Let's go. Juiced has not yet noticed. Are you

427
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:39,909
serious? Okay. Fight, fight. Two damage. That's it. Building power up. This one looks tough.

428
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:51,739
Okay, what about item herb times 10? Run. Can I just run? You can't run away. I wasted a turn.

429
01:09:52,699 --> 01:10:02,279
Shit. 65 damage. All right, hold on. Magic. Fire. Blizzard. Thunder. I'm gonna try fire.

430
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:13,350
Fire. Not enough MP. What? Sonic juice special attack. Legendary water gun. I don't have enough

431
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:27,939
MP. That hurt a lot. Is it battery? Summon. No, not yet. Charge. Oh, okay. Do I have to

432
01:10:28,579 --> 01:10:40,380
do anything? Building up power. Okay. Magic. Fire. What do you mean not enough MP? What are you

433
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:53,029
talking about? Where's my MP? Okay. How about summon? I'm just gonna summon somebody.

434
01:10:55,109 --> 01:11:04,789
Bahamut is off on vacation. Sonic juice special attack. Legendary water gun. I think I just have

435
01:11:04,789 --> 01:11:17,909
to hit him. Fight. Summon. Charge. Okay, fight. System window? Wait, I can attack? Wait, come

436
01:11:17,909 --> 01:11:35,239
back. What? What the fuck is this? Are you serious? Okay, that's funny. But wait, I don't want to do

437
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:52,420
that first because I'm able to see what I'm doing. 150 damage. I have herb. All right, item item item.

438
01:11:52,420 --> 01:12:00,470
Take an herb. 1000 HP restored. Okay, cool. Sonic juice special attack. Legendary water.

439
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,850
I'm gonna attack the thing on the left first because that's info I don't really care about.

440
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:25,899
360. Summon again? Summon. Knights of the round table. The round table meeting has gone into

441
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:41,850
overtime. I still have plenty of health. All right, fight. I want to kill this thing. All right,

442
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:47,529
that thing's dead. But I want to be able to still fight. So if I get rid of that, will I?

443
01:12:50,600 --> 01:13:01,000
Wait a minute. If I get rid of this. Oh shit. If I kill this, will I be able to move?

444
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:19,500
I wonder if I just kill this, I can move around. Try a different magic. I don't have MP. Blizzard.

445
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:32,140
I don't have MP. Sonic juice special attack. Legendary water. Dry thunder for a clean machine.

446
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:40,500
Oh yeah, let's try thunder. I can do thunder. Your beam cannon is overflowing with power.

447
01:13:41,619 --> 01:13:51,739
Shit, all right, hold on. Try attack him? I'm gonna kill the system window. Attack doesn't reach.

448
01:13:51,739 --> 01:14:09,109
Fuck. Wait, what? Can I do thunder again? What should I hit with this? Him? Oh, that's a critical

449
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:20,149
hit. That does damage. That's 700 damage. Okay. I don't think I want to kill the thing on the

450
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:31,590
bottom. If I kill the command window, can I even attack him? I'm gonna try. We'll see what happens.

451
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:56,409
Whatever. I wonder if it lets me move around. Okay. Yeah, I'll heal.

452
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:06,229
I don't know how much health I have. Let's see. Um, probably like 1,400?

453
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:22,199
All right, what happens if I do this? That's enough of this JRPG bullshit. Oh, okay.

454
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:30,569
I'm here on out. We're having a boss fight. Now I can move around.

455
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:47,380
Yeah.

456
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:07,300
Let's go. We're gonna push it to the limit. Oh, limit. So this is the power of light.

457
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:25,659
Let's go. I hope this song is an absolute banger. You know what I mean? Oh, that hurt.

458
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:33,689
Where is it? Fuck. All right. I got to time that better.

459
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:47,960
Fuck. Dodge better. There we go. Oh, that hurts.

460
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:06,380
Can I kick him from here? Nope. Okay. That was a bad idea. That hits him.

461
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:31,460
One punch man. There it is. There's the dodge. Can I get him here? I can reach him from here.

462
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,220
When he leans in, I can get him like that. All right. Good. Let's go.

463
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:41,180
Can I hit him with anything else?

464
01:17:41,180 --> 01:18:01,699
I don't think so. There it is again. Go. Mustang mode. Oh my God. It's unfair.

465
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:14,739
It's so unfair to get this at a boss. It's a whole phase gone. Oh my goodness. What do I do?

466
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:35,859
Whoa. It takes up the whole screen. Get up. I don't even know what movie is doing.

467
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:40,680
Oh my God. Okay. Don't die. I just got a free phase. It's gone.

468
01:18:49,960 --> 01:19:01,670
Left side. Stay all the way up. Jump. What? Oh, you got to go in the middle. I get it. Okay.

469
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:26,199
Let's get in there. All right. Two and then in the middle.

470
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:43,289
I missed. I'm in a good shape though. I'm fine. That wasn't a perfect dodge. How?

471
01:19:49,189 --> 01:20:00,659
It is an MMO fight. All right. I got to get perfect dodge. Come on.

472
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:21,829
Oh, fuck. I was trying to dodge through it. All right. He's slow. No, get in there quick.

473
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:32,699
Please. All right. Don't fuck this one up. That one's easy to avoid.

474
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:46,140
All right.

475
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:55,210
In the middle. He's almost dead.

476
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:22,659
Get in close. Come on. What is he saying? Homey testo. All right. Is it? He's done.

477
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:33,319
That was a cool fight. I liked that one a lot actually. That was really cool.

478
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:49,720
What? I submit. I give up. I cannot fight pointlessly any longer. Begging for quarter,

479
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:55,720
huh? So even aliens have that sort of thing. There are people waiting for me on my planet.

480
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:04,420
I cannot die yet. Fine. You're an interesting guy.

481
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:18,119
You fucking dick prince. You're getting soft assassin. You can't beat me like that.

482
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:29,060
You're too soft. Wasn't that your friend? I've forgotten about all that old stuff.

483
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:34,840
We're in different positions now. Whatever. Let's settle this here.

484
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:41,079
Yeah. Who's who? Looks like we've got the stage all set. Bring it.

485
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:58,939
What the fuck is going on with her?

486
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,760
She keeps being upgraded every time we see her.

487
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:20,199
What happened to three? What happened to two?

488
01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:38,630
Those eyes.

489
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:56,380
I borrowed it. A certain benevolent third party said I could use it.

490
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:59,739
Here's the copyright related stuff. Thanks a lot, your son.

491
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:05,369
With that kind of technology, I could have come to this planet without full armor.

492
01:24:06,869 --> 01:24:14,229
This play of Slot Air enters the final act. Round and round, Travis. Go round and round

493
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:22,149
this hell of battle. Go round and round and round again. Oh, I almost forgot. It's time

494
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:27,510
for my beach yoga appointment. Sorry. Gotta go. Silvia, I need to talk to you.

495
01:24:29,989 --> 01:24:55,159
Eyes are gone. Give me an S. See? That's too bad. The thing about this game that we're realizing,

496
01:24:55,159 --> 01:25:02,069
spoilers by the way, if you don't know what we're doing. This whole list was just here for a joke.

497
01:25:02,869 --> 01:25:06,550
None of this even mattered. That's kind of funny to me. Like, oh, the top 10

498
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:13,430
cosmic assassins. It didn't even matter. That's not even who we fought. More than like two-thirds

499
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:30,039
of the time. That's hilarious. You fight only like half of them, yeah. So I'm really just kind of

500
01:25:30,039 --> 01:25:36,869
wondering what the last arc of this game is going to be then. If this game's entire storyline here

501
01:25:36,869 --> 01:25:39,989
so far has been Suda 51 just doesn't give a shit and he's going to do whatever he wants,

502
01:25:42,489 --> 01:25:46,949
what happens at the end? I have no idea what they're going to do. I have no idea what happens.

503
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:53,420
I'm more interested in what the last boss fight is even going to be than anything that we've done

504
01:25:53,420 --> 01:26:04,810
so far. Like the story of what happens at the end is more important to me than that entire game.

505
01:26:05,449 --> 01:26:26,180
There's probably going to be like three or four people that kill each other in a row.

506
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:48,069
We're going to get the dollhouse lawyer joke except in the actual game. It's going to be

507
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:59,770
a pog ending. Oh, sorry. I bumped you. Very curious. Everyone's just a lawyer. We're going

508
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:38,329
to get overstimulated again. Don't talk through the intro. Ranking the chair at the same.

509
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:51,420
Noah makes me cave perfect. He's even good at period pieces. Here it is. The big three period

510
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:58,939
pieces. The best one has got to be 13 assassins, right? After that, it's ninja kids. Harakiri,

511
01:27:58,939 --> 01:28:05,659
death of a samurai is a masterpiece too. The casting is amazing. Who's this cool ass Japanese

512
01:28:05,659 --> 01:28:13,659
dude? Yeah, Takayuki is great. That sort of instability is awesome. Takayuki isn't acting.

513
01:28:13,659 --> 01:28:21,899
He's swimming in the sea of imagery. Kubota is going to go places too. Kubota? From Katai

514
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:30,539
investigator seven? That's one good looking dude. Is that the medic? Yeah. He's awesome.

515
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:37,579
But Nobuaki is hella sweet. Not enough can be said about Mieke's delinquent movies.

516
01:28:37,579 --> 01:28:44,060
He totally gets the fine line between delinquent and Yakuza. Let's give credit where it's deserved.

517
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:50,859
Our standings for the world of grownups. He really burns depth and fear into his imagery.

518
01:28:50,859 --> 01:29:02,359
Fuck, Mieke is so awesome. For real. It's a bad chill. I haven't even started over your dead body

519
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:13,430
yet. I'm gonna go outside real quick. I will, let's go on record here. I think that any voice

520
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:23,210
actor I've ever heard, I think Robin Ackendowns is the absolute best. He's got the best exclamation

521
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:30,890
sound. No one comes close. In the entire industry. I'm not gonna be able to do it,

522
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:35,609
but that like, whoa, like whoa, like no one, literally nobody can do it but him.

523
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:48,600
He's got the best exclamations in the entire industry. You know the one I'm talking about too.

524
01:29:50,260 --> 01:30:09,560
His yelling and his exclamatory way of talking is just unbeatable. He's the best in the English

525
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:20,260
VA scene. Yeah, I would say he's probably up there in the top five at least. Top 10 without a doubt.

526
01:30:20,899 --> 01:30:30,840
All right, let's change the clothes here. I feel like this is gonna be one of the last,

527
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:36,680
this is gonna be one of the last t-shirts. Let's make it count.

528
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:59,479
I kind of like this one. That's the new one. Are we gonna need anything else besides that?

529
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:21,859
Hmm, put on the fuck racism one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, this is the one.

530
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:49,539
Yeah, I think we end the game with this. I want some more color. I want like reds, teals, blues,

531
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:55,960
Robin's egg blue, bright green. All the t-shirts are like just white with black.

532
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:03,479
It's just a white t-shirt with like a black print. I want more than just white t-shirts.

533
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:09,189
I have to find them probably, right? The ones that you just get for doing the game.

534
01:32:09,989 --> 01:32:20,869
All the t-shirt aliens, I need to find them. I want like a bright orange shirt,

535
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:27,930
or like bright yellow or something. The boss t-shirts are all white with black logos.

536
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:40,859
Ah, that makes sense, yeah. Well, this is different. You got a mail from someone mysterious.

537
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:50,180
Okay, what is it? Order of the Emerald Knight. Wait in the motel parking lot.

538
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:54,659
My cross sword craves your blood. Once you're ready, come out to the motel parking lot.

539
01:32:57,449 --> 01:33:29,899
Uh, okay. Let's check on bad girl. Hey old man, I got a bad feeling. What is it,

540
01:33:29,899 --> 01:33:33,819
you gonna tell me my fortune or something? If you were a getter, then I'd believe you,

541
01:33:33,819 --> 01:33:38,729
but anything else is just bullshitting. I got no idea what that means, but this town is filled

542
01:33:38,729 --> 01:33:43,930
with evil. You better watch your back. Whatever may come, I'll protect this town. You don't have

543
01:33:43,930 --> 01:34:02,180
to worry. I just walked around that room like it was Resident Evil 2. Seven viewer Andy. That's

544
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:07,140
because I don't stream long enough. Do you understand? I turn my broadcast on and turn

545
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:14,039
it off in 30 seconds. You're not going to get engagement that way, Travis. Um, do I want to do

546
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:32,760
this right now? I guess. Yeah, let's do it. You should do a one minute stream. I've thought about

547
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,840
doing that joke before where I turn the stream on and turns off in five minutes, but I mean,

548
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,479
people's notifications don't even come in that it's just awful. This just fucks up everybody's

549
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:50,199
timeline. Battle is all about rhythm. If you can pick up on certain rules and signs, you could

550
01:34:50,199 --> 01:35:09,319
leave your body to the rhythm and simply let yourself dance to it. But even so, you know,

551
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:18,520
having a brother like you, it's fucking embarrassing. You retweet asshole. How many times must I say this?

552
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:24,760
I saw a movie about God and it just flowed through me like electricity. I realized the

553
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:29,079
anguish of having such a good for nothing little brother and came to the conclusion

554
01:35:29,079 --> 01:35:35,000
that I have to stop you. Yeah, no thanks. Quit getting in my way with your personal bullshit.

555
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:46,489
Hey, do you remember? Nope. Listen, little brother, it was a snowy day. We three siblings

556
01:35:46,489 --> 01:35:52,569
made our escape from our serial killer father. In TSA, he watched the movie Thor and joined a

557
01:35:52,569 --> 01:35:59,590
cult because of it. And you were crying as you ran. We spent days and days in the woods.

558
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:06,710
We built an igloo out of the snow to escape the cold. We had finally found our way to a major road.

559
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:15,270
Those huge cars moved in and surrounded us. We heard the sound of the rocks. The adults,

560
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:22,180
they took us and they tied us up. After that, I lost all my memories. I had them overwritten

561
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:30,579
with those of a child born to the cool down family. So fucking what? This is something you

562
01:36:30,579 --> 01:36:36,180
got to bring up right here, right now? Right here, right now is exactly why I bring this up,

563
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:42,899
little brother. You were always crying. Keep on crying as you live, as you always have. Now,

564
01:36:43,539 --> 01:36:50,500
keep on crying as you die. You really turned out fucked up, you know that? The fuck is all this

565
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:58,779
dark side bullshit? Before worrying about me, first kill that ass white. He's not my time.

566
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:16,069
This sword cuts like no other. Let's go. You fucking prevert. Hey, well again,

567
01:37:16,069 --> 01:37:43,739
motel parking lot. Perfect. Fuck him up. You can't even get out of my 30 hit combo, buddy.

568
01:37:54,760 --> 01:38:18,090
No, I'm on fire. All right, phase two. We're going to go into space. I hope not.

569
01:38:21,369 --> 01:38:26,340
Whoa. Okay. That was bad.

570
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,869
Nice bit rate. I can imagine how bad it was.

571
01:38:56,869 --> 01:39:35,800
It's cheating at this point. Okay. That was annoying. I couldn't touch him. Shit. Okay.

572
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:45,430
I don't have any heels left. Fuck. All right. Just play well.

573
01:40:04,569 --> 01:40:20,899
Good night. I wonder how much more difficult this is on hard.

574
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:27,539
I wonder if it's going to be one of those cases where it's like way too hard on hard

575
01:40:27,539 --> 01:40:45,510
and way too easy on normal. I wonder. Henry, cool down, dead. You just killed your brother.

576
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:54,100
This fight was brutal on Carolina Reaper because it's two more difficulties after you beat the

577
01:40:54,100 --> 01:41:24,010
game. Right? This is horrifying. Oh, smash brothers.

578
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:31,050
That's not what I was talking about, by the way. And that's what people thought I was.

579
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:49,739
Okay. Well, so that counts as two.

580
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:05,020
That is great. Yeah. Just one left. Prince fool is waiting.

581
01:42:06,699 --> 01:42:11,979
The hell is going? She lives here? Once all this fighting is over, will you listen to me?

582
01:42:11,979 --> 01:42:22,359
I need to talk to you. You're right. I will think about it. They're married.

583
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:53,989
So now I have to go to a food tower. Oh, no. Okay. Are they clones? Okay. Wait,

584
01:42:53,989 --> 01:43:06,550
that was the whole episode? Man, the runtime on that one. That's quite a short episode.

585
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:12,710
That's not the standard 22 minute runtime. That's the non-standard four minute runtime.

586
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:34,979
That was half of an Aquatine episode. It was filler. Non-cannon filler. That's so funny.

587
01:43:34,979 --> 01:44:00,439
I hope that's accurate. Someone just said, uh-oh, budget's running low. Be careful. You know,

588
01:44:00,439 --> 01:44:06,630
if I were a game company or a media company, I would make the last two episodes first. Wouldn't

589
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:20,329
you? They do that sometimes. Yeah. Like make sure you get the whole last two or three episodes

590
01:44:20,329 --> 01:44:25,609
done with a ton of the money. And then you cut, you know, then cut corners when they're like

591
01:44:25,609 --> 01:44:31,979
having tea in the laundry room, right? We don't need the budget for that one. I'm sure they do.

592
01:44:31,979 --> 01:44:43,720
I hope they do. Most writers start at the ending. Yeah. But does this production start at the ending?

593
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:48,600
Not a lot of times, but maybe not. But you're just going to bug out here.

594
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:57,659
This shit is going to get recalled. What? Am I stuck in the bathroom?

595
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:06,229
Huh? Iwasaki? Oh, you're not there either. You got to keep the saber-related stuff in working

596
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:13,340
shape, man. Who the hell debugged this shit? Don't tell me it was their checks are way too

597
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:26,310
lax. Should have gone with. Okay. Wait, this is no bug. You assholes. Are you Henry's buddies?

598
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:37,960
You dirty fucking cosplayers. Wait, I can't fight in the bathroom? What? You screwed up.

599
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:45,689
Piece of shit. I told you as your older brother, it's my duty to kill you.

600
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:50,489
It's going to take more than this to kill my ass. That's good little brother.

601
01:45:50,810 --> 01:46:30,619
We just killed him. What? Page 99. Three lives left. Okay. This is Death Man. This is the beginning

602
01:46:30,619 --> 01:46:34,939
of the game. He was talking about this game that he played. This game I played. It's called Death

603
01:46:34,939 --> 01:46:55,739
Man. Oh, he died in one hit. I gotta be aware of that. Good thing I had blinking so I couldn't get

604
01:46:55,739 --> 01:47:14,699
hurt. Oh my god. You die by the spikes. Okay. That's good to know. I can't hurt that guy.

605
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:28,180
This is cube? I think I have to collect them or something. I thought that was a pizza. That's

606
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:47,300
cool looking. Okay. Oh, it's death. Where's death? I love the Sega Genesis sounds, though.

607
01:47:53,060 --> 01:48:12,180
Death. What's that do? Death. What the hell is going on? Oh, geez. All right. I need that sword.

608
01:48:17,210 --> 01:48:26,520
All right. Kill. Well, all right. I like this game. This game's fun. All right. Hit him a couple

609
01:48:26,520 --> 01:49:15,060
times. What the fuck hit me? Drop it. Give me the sword. Dark Souls 2 hitboxes. No, don't get hurt.

610
01:49:15,619 --> 01:49:26,979
There's too many enemies on the screen. I gotta clear. Oh, how much health does he have?

611
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:59,930
Oh, fuck you. Give it to me. Shit. Got him. All right. I think this is just, it's scripted.

612
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:25,140
You're supposed to get hurt. Okay. Who are you? A passing assassin. Well, a dead assassin now.

613
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:33,220
Welcome to the world of death, man. Let us raise a glass to death. So this is the land of death,

614
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:39,029
huh? Okay. I'm not even going to try. He's unmatched. Looks like something from an 80s

615
01:50:39,029 --> 01:50:45,369
arcade game. What hardware does this run on? A death drive? No, I can't. They're not even worth

616
01:50:45,369 --> 01:50:55,100
it. You can't imitate like literal gold. It's impossible. Here, take this. What's this?

617
01:50:55,979 --> 01:51:06,760
Blood wine. 100 year old death emperor wine. Enjoy. You got any beer? I don't have kids drinks here.

618
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:18,939
Okay, fine then. Cheers. Congratulations, Travis. You're an uninvited guest here.

619
01:51:19,899 --> 01:51:37,659
Return to the piss smelling world from whence you came. Right on. Send me back. Let's give him his

620
01:51:37,659 --> 01:52:01,399
head cut off. If you die in the game, you come back to life. That's not the joke. Hey, anybody

621
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:11,050
there? Hey, I'm still alive down here. Somebody give me a hand, huh? Hello, anybody there? I'm buried?

622
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:25,260
Grave keeper! Somebody! Seriously, I'm gonna die! Let me out! Help me!

623
01:52:30,630 --> 01:52:36,069
Wait, not even buried? Just sitting in a cement casket? Yeah. Thanks a lot. Wait. Seriously.

624
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:50,199
I was buried, okay. What a pinch getting buried alive. For reals? You're- My name is Miike.

625
01:52:51,079 --> 01:52:58,039
You're a friend of his, right? Mr. Miike. Miike. You're reading Takashi Miike.

626
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:03,000
Are you shooting something here? Are you finally making your Hollywood debut?

627
01:53:04,039 --> 01:53:11,079
Andromedia 2. No, that's not it. Ichi the Killer 2. Oh shit, I hella wanna see that. Real person

628
01:53:11,079 --> 01:53:13,960
Omegalo, yeah.

629
01:53:41,449 --> 01:53:49,369
I've got a request. Do you mind? What is it? I'd be happy to do whatever I can. Could you film

630
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:59,500
a live action version of No More Heroes? They're not gonna do that, are they? No, they're not.

631
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:05,479
Did they do that? Did they actually do it? Did they do at least- Please tell me they did that.

632
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:13,800
Do it. Do it! Do it! This is a bit- This game goes up full letter grade if they do it.

633
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:27,109
Battle was a success. The champ's here too. Welcome back, grandpa. You're here too.

634
01:54:28,359 --> 01:54:32,840
You'll be going up against him next. Do a live action bit, please. And she's here too.

635
01:54:34,949 --> 01:54:45,539
Don't worry about me. My dad took choice with you. Charlotte, the bloodlust is back in your eyes.

636
01:54:45,539 --> 01:54:54,420
Don't call me that. Leave the rest to me. Oh, I don't know if they're gonna do it.

637
01:54:56,579 --> 01:55:10,819
I hope they do. Please. It's about time for the climax. Oh, they don't. That's too bad.

638
01:55:11,779 --> 01:55:16,170
Can you imagine if all of a sudden we saw a trailer for No More Heroes?

639
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:27,739
SSR. SSR. SSR. Wait, don't write it off yet. We're not gonna show it.

640
01:55:30,119 --> 01:55:33,640
What was the point in killing him? Yeah, I don't- What was that? What even happened?

641
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:51,060
How bleak. It wasn't that long ago, but it somehow feels nostalgic. It feels like it was years ago.

642
01:55:52,859 --> 01:55:59,420
Give it up for Travis. Humans aren't all bullshit after all. He's no representative of humanity.

643
01:55:59,979 --> 01:56:08,539
He's just a street punk. Why do you hate him so much? Netflix. I hate punks. They're violent,

644
01:56:08,539 --> 01:56:16,140
evil psychos. Kind of like you, Fu. This is my fight, but it's Travis's fight as well.

645
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:25,739
As fighters, we understand each other somewhat. But you, you don't fight. Oh, Damon. That's right.

646
01:56:25,739 --> 01:56:35,909
I have nothing to do with this. I was simply dragged into it all. Think about it. Why would

647
01:56:35,909 --> 01:56:46,069
Travis come here? Was it a coincidence? He's, because he's an assassin. No, you brought Travis

648
01:56:46,069 --> 01:56:53,109
here. You wanted me to do it. To kill Travis. I never asked you to do that.

649
01:56:54,869 --> 01:57:01,430
We're connected here. So I wanted to fulfill your wish for you. What? For me?

650
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:09,529
The final battle. Watch it up close. Watch as Travis dies.

651
01:57:11,369 --> 01:57:45,619
He wants Fu to die. This is like WWE. Yeah, but Travis beats up Damon in TSA. Skipped TSA.

652
01:57:45,619 --> 01:57:54,970
From a window. This game doesn't feel like it's about anything.

653
01:57:55,369 --> 01:58:06,199
Master, I'm sorry for the trouble. It's cool. Let's watch some movies. Today, we're doing a

654
01:58:06,199 --> 01:58:14,579
Miyake and Hideaki viewing party. So, how are your arms doing? Slowly but surely, I'm getting used

655
01:58:14,579 --> 01:58:21,500
to this sensation. I can't hold my sword just yet, though. No need to rush. I want to hurry up and

656
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:30,409
help you out. What do you like, Shinobu? What do I like? I like my master. It almost feels like

657
01:58:30,409 --> 01:58:36,329
Suda51 was told by his parents that you can dress yourself today. It's like what this whole

658
01:58:36,329 --> 01:58:47,800
game kind of feels like. Like a little kid. It's just insane. There's a bunch of combinations that

659
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:58,420
don't make sense next to each other. You got your dad's like size 10 shoes on.

660
01:58:58,579 --> 01:59:03,220
Barbados swordplay. Wearing a big styled peacock hat.

661
01:59:05,819 --> 01:59:09,340
The broadsword action. And how this blouse is on. It's like going down to your knees.

662
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:13,819
Four pairs of underwear on. The right way is the way of the sword.

663
01:59:13,819 --> 01:59:22,569
Times like this. Miyake and swords means blade of the immortal.

664
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:30,359
Immortal? Love the original. I'd like to watch that one. Please show me the film.

665
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:44,100
Everything just so mushed up together. There's like no rhyme or reason to anything,

666
01:59:44,100 --> 02:00:02,550
but somehow there is. You can play Death Man in your room. Oh, cool. This is way too deep for you,

667
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:22,470
bro. I'm afraid to save the game. We get a pee break? Yeah, we'll do a pee break. It's been

668
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:31,779
about two hours. Do I have any money? Oh, I have enough money to do this. I'm going to spend some

669
02:00:31,779 --> 02:00:37,510
of the money and then we'll take a break. I'll be right back. I might get another coffee too.

670
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:55,619
I'm only a coffee mood right now. It's so funny because this game, there's probably been a few

671
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:59,140
times where I could have told you I didn't like something in the game, but I can't tell you that.

672
02:00:59,699 --> 02:01:04,970
It's weird. It may have been a handful of opportunities where I really could have been

673
02:01:04,970 --> 02:01:11,000
like, yeah, this is like this. I don't like this part, but my vocal cords and my lips cannot tell

674
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:23,399
you that. They can't speak it to you for some reason. I don't know why. Oh, I think.

675
02:01:29,829 --> 02:01:48,100
Hmm. Let's just dump it into the cool down. It's not in his programming. Oh, okay. The real thing

676
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:52,020
that I could tell you, which is just like, holy shit, this looks awful, is a lot of the graphics

677
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:55,939
really do feel like they're from like the Wii. It just feels like a Wii game a lot of times,

678
02:01:55,939 --> 02:02:14,819
but like who cares? Like I really don't care. It's not a problem to me. Okay. It would be a

679
02:02:14,819 --> 02:02:21,800
problem if the game slowed down a shit load and if it ran at a terrible frame rate or something,

680
02:02:22,359 --> 02:02:25,640
and if it actually impeded the video game, I'd be like, wow, this sucks.

681
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:34,409
I don't really don't care. All right. Let's take a few break. I'll be right back.

682
02:02:35,130 --> 02:02:38,970
Give me like two, three minutes. I'm going to make another coffee. Back in like a few minutes.

683
02:02:38,970 --> 02:09:23,859
See you soon. Hello. Hi. Oh, I fucking fell in. What did you fall in? What did you fall in?

684
02:09:25,029 --> 02:09:28,229
Oh, hey, who's in the, hello, who's in the bathroom? I'm in here.

685
02:09:29,029 --> 02:09:43,659
You've been in there for a while. What'd you fall in? Let's chant. All right. Let's get back to it.

686
02:09:43,659 --> 02:09:50,789
This is the final, probably last half an hour or so of this game, I would assume. I don't know.

687
02:09:52,619 --> 02:10:19,300
I am ready to play. Oh, I just did that. Stop doing that. Make a convention about yourself and

688
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:27,140
call it Germacon. I got like fucking shit faced one night and I talked about rent out a whole

689
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:31,829
section of one of the casinos here and we're going to have a convention. I literally made that

690
02:10:31,829 --> 02:10:37,239
reference. Uh, no, that just didn't happen. All right. Congratulations on rank two. We're

691
02:10:37,239 --> 02:10:44,060
coming to inform you the entry conditions for the next battle. Uh, $60,000 is the final amount of

692
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:58,810
money you need. So designated matches are where exactly? Anywhere? Just any of the ones that I've

693
02:10:58,810 --> 02:11:13,300
done already. Where is that? Um, where is who's castle or whatever it is. We're here. It's two

694
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:19,079
here. I think I can just do them anywhere then. Where am I? All right. So there's a couple here.

695
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,340
Well, let's do that. Let's do the one here too that I haven't done yet.

696
02:11:23,899 --> 02:11:36,359
You recorded stream. Got me. What is, what is this thing you guys are writing?

697
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:41,640
Women want me. Fish want me. What, what is this? What's this a reference to? I don't get it.

698
02:11:50,420 --> 02:12:02,840
It's just a case of unfunny spam. Okay. Um, streamer just told you to do something.

699
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:09,529
So I, I suggest you fucking do it. I said, stop. Streamer literally just told you to do something

700
02:12:09,529 --> 02:12:34,859
and fucking stop doing it. Mods started it. Really? Monka W. Start the game. Monka W is

701
02:12:34,859 --> 02:12:46,439
not a chant. It's a face. I'm sorry. Monka W is not like, it's everybody collectively in the

702
02:12:46,439 --> 02:13:01,340
stadium. All going like, Oh wait, if it was Monka W it'd be imagine it was like, Oh, look

703
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:06,869
out the stadium. The stadium is doing Monka W right now. There's a bunch of people that

704
02:13:06,869 --> 02:13:15,609
the whole stadium is just doing that. That's not a chant. An expression. The game is very loud now.

705
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:31,369
That person just got sniped by your own teammate. You guys can't even work together.

706
02:13:40,789 --> 02:13:52,100
Verbally chanting Monka W. Why would you chant Monka W? Monka W. Monka W. Monka W. Monka W.

707
02:13:52,100 --> 02:14:07,880
It'd just be like, what the fuck are these people doing? Oh, suplex machine. Isn't that

708
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:21,899
somebody's actual move in wrestling? Suplex city. This guy's almost dead. This guy's a huge pain

709
02:14:21,899 --> 02:14:44,090
in the ass. All right, come on. Kill the bull. Nice. What was that move? Oh, nobody does German

710
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:56,779
suplexes. They did not do them anymore? Do they not do German suplexes in wrestling anymore?

711
02:14:57,659 --> 02:15:20,500
Brock Lesnar does them all the time. It's too dangerous. Come on. Swing. Swing. You're too

712
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:27,909
slow. I don't like slow enemies. I have no health. I don't like slow enemies. They're hard to predict.

713
02:15:28,550 --> 02:16:07,220
Fucking die. Stars. Yes. Invincible load activated. You can't hurt me. Funny because he showed up

714
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:25,619
yesterday in Smackdown. I didn't see what the rating was. Was it good? I was looking at chat.

715
02:16:25,619 --> 02:16:36,389
You still watch wrestling? I do not. I used to like wrestling because wrestling to me was

716
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:43,290
a cartoon. It was superheroes fighting each other and just wild outrageous shit going on.

717
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:48,969
It was never supposed to be real to me. It was always like almost theater in a way.

718
02:16:50,229 --> 02:16:55,110
In recent years, wrestling has tried to be a like taken as seriously as baseball.

719
02:16:57,379 --> 02:17:10,860
So it's like I don't care. And yeah, I have heard that like AEW is do watch AEW watch AEW. I know,

720
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:26,260
but I think I'm probably just kind of over it too in a way. I gotta go that way. Which way am I

721
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:45,850
going here? He's a jaded old man. WWE is still hitting record profits. I mean, I didn't say

722
02:17:45,850 --> 02:17:50,790
that you should not watch wrestling and it's not popular and everybody hates it. I just said the

723
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:54,629
reason why I used to watch wrestling was not because of the fact that they were wrestling.

724
02:17:55,350 --> 02:18:01,190
It was like Ken Shamrock being locked in a cage and incredible hulking bending the bars like

725
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:11,159
Superman. It was Mick Foley being three different people, even though you knew he was just one guy.

726
02:18:11,159 --> 02:18:15,559
Oh, there here comes Cactus Jack, a dude love. They would, they were two different people,

727
02:18:15,559 --> 02:18:31,239
but it was literally just him being three or four different characters. It was like the promos,

728
02:18:31,239 --> 02:18:36,680
wrestling promos. Some of them were so good. They were some of the funniest comedic actors,

729
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:42,069
like theater actors you would ever see. The magic's not there for me anymore. I think the

730
02:18:42,069 --> 02:18:49,639
promos are eh. Nobody's intense anymore. Like people, it's too, I don't know, it feels like

731
02:18:49,639 --> 02:19:00,920
too real life to me. The three stooges. Yeah, it was very much like slapstick comedy for me.

732
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:15,129
The last great promo machine was the rock. Yeah, it was. Got enough costumes. Yeah, I,

733
02:19:16,329 --> 02:19:22,120
it was fun to have these superheroes fight each other. Just think about it. The inherent,

734
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:29,659
inherently doing like a special move to somebody doesn't do anything, right? Like, oh my god,

735
02:19:29,659 --> 02:19:34,780
his finisher, the tombstone pile driver. What's the difference? It's literally you're dropping

736
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:41,530
the guy on the same mat, but they were supposed to be like superpowers. Oh no, he's doing his

737
02:19:41,530 --> 02:19:49,209
finishing superpower. Now, when you take that like kind of weird costumey theater out of it,

738
02:19:49,209 --> 02:19:54,709
I don't care if you have a superpower. You're just a guy with a speedo on. Like that superpower

739
02:19:54,709 --> 02:19:59,350
does not hold the same weight for me. It's like, oh no, here he comes. Here comes Jeff Anderson

740
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:05,750
with his superpower taking you to the bank. I don't, you're just a guy. I don't care. Like

741
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:18,459
you don't have a superpower. The undertaker could have a superpower because he was the

742
02:20:18,459 --> 02:20:23,180
undertaker. The guy literally would like raise from the dead in the middle of the ring. And there

743
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:29,739
was a fat guy on the outside who was a showman that had an urn that pretended that he was like

744
02:20:29,739 --> 02:20:35,260
had power from whoever was in that urn. He was like a dead guy. And you knew it wasn't real,

745
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:39,819
but you didn't care because it was a fucking show. It was like theater. I'm going to die.

746
02:20:44,309 --> 02:20:52,020
Whoa. Like if, if like Dave Anderson came out with an urn and the Paul Bearer character,

747
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:55,860
it'd be like, what? This doesn't, you, you, you can't be both at the same time.

748
02:20:56,579 --> 02:21:01,590
You didn't care because it was entertaining. Yeah. It was entertainment.

749
02:21:06,739 --> 02:21:14,620
I've never got Travis before. Oh yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Have you ever watched Lucha Libre? No,

750
02:21:14,620 --> 02:21:23,350
I have not. I've seen some of it and like they're fucking fun. They're entertaining. I would love

751
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:29,340
to get into that because correct me if I'm wrong, but they still treat it like it's a big grand show.

752
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:40,549
Right. I kind of just don't even know where to start. All right. Hold on. I'm like not even

753
02:21:40,549 --> 02:21:48,790
paying attention. I'm reading chat right now. Were you WCW or WWF fan? I was both. I liked them both

754
02:21:48,790 --> 02:21:54,299
for different reasons. There was a time you can remember where like Hulk Hogan, like Macho Man,

755
02:21:54,299 --> 02:22:05,780
they were in the WCW. I remember people like throwing fucking drinks into the ring.

756
02:22:08,149 --> 02:22:14,309
You guys remember that? When Hulk Hogan went heel and people were literally throwing fucking

757
02:22:14,309 --> 02:22:21,110
objects into the ring, like sodas and drinks and trash and shit. It was insane. Like never before,

758
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:25,270
Hulk Hogan became a bad guy and everyone was like, people were like crying in the stands.

759
02:22:25,909 --> 02:22:43,190
It was crazy. Okay. This is hard. Remember the chairs? Stop throwing chairs. Yeah. People

760
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:49,340
were throwing chairs into the ring. I got to get this Mustang though. Let me pay attention.

761
02:22:49,340 --> 02:22:59,290
But the point is it was really entertaining television and I know, look, I'm not going to

762
02:22:59,290 --> 02:23:04,170
talk like I'm some, oh, I don't understand what happened. A lot of that shit was dangerous and

763
02:23:04,170 --> 02:23:09,930
people got hurt. There was a lot of problems, you know, drugs and potential like performance

764
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:16,250
enhancing like steroids. Look, I get it, right? But it's not fun for me anymore.

765
02:23:17,129 --> 02:23:20,969
And I know that you kind of have to, as we, you know, learn about how things are dangerous and

766
02:23:20,969 --> 02:23:25,610
shit, like, yeah, the early to mid to late nineties. Oh, whatever. Just take a bunch of

767
02:23:25,610 --> 02:23:30,649
steroids and pile driver people. Like, yeah, I get, I know that's like, you can't really do that

768
02:23:30,649 --> 02:23:44,549
really anymore, right? I got to get a Mustang mode. Hold on. This level actually is probably

769
02:23:44,549 --> 02:23:55,930
harder than anything in the whole game so far. I got to get a Mustang mode. All right. Here we go.

770
02:23:55,930 --> 02:24:22,950
This is when you get it. No, this is where you get it. What the fuck? It's nothing because you can't

771
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:29,959
heal anymore. All right. I got to go get heals after this Japanese wrestling is still wild.

772
02:24:33,379 --> 02:24:37,139
Yeah. I just, I don't know. It doesn't, it's just, it almost feels like there's no weight to it

773
02:24:37,139 --> 02:24:56,329
anymore. Okay. This guy is invincible. So that's not going to happen. Apparently Jesus. This guy,

774
02:24:57,209 --> 02:25:28,920
Jesus, this guy, this guy, man, Jesus, this guy, this guy, man. All right. This guy,

775
02:25:29,719 --> 02:25:42,120
like this guy, really this fucking guy.

776
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:56,069
All right. Give me some, I'm getting out of here. I'm getting healed. No, I'm not. Okay. Here we go.

777
02:25:56,069 --> 02:26:09,139
Last try. Don't let me down, dude. Got it. Okay. Let's go. Yeah. I have to get one slot effect and

778
02:26:09,139 --> 02:26:42,899
I will win. Just need one. Come here. No, there it is. All right. Mustang mode. I'm just going to

779
02:26:42,899 --> 02:27:07,739
spam X. Come on. Mustang mode again. Do it. Get away. Get away. Kill this guy. I got to kill the

780
02:27:07,739 --> 02:27:24,729
other guy. This dude in the back here. All right. Now it's just me and you. I can actually do this.

781
02:27:24,729 --> 02:27:55,780
Let's do it. All right. Perfecto. Let's do it. What? He was stunned. No. He got out of the way.

782
02:27:55,780 --> 02:28:00,020
I had half health. You got to be kidding me. Why is this guy so, this is the hardest thing

783
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:22,329
in the whole game. This dude has an instant kill moves. The end of the PS5 game announcements.

784
02:28:22,329 --> 02:28:34,860
I have not paid any attention at all. Let's go. I need to get actual heals and not just

785
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:40,659
walk to the boss fight with zero Estus flasks. I would, you would, I would never do that

786
02:28:41,379 --> 02:29:12,010
ever in real life. Okay. Give me all this. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.

787
02:29:13,239 --> 02:29:29,370
Okay. Bye bye. Spider-man 2 PS5. I still have to play the Miles Morales one. All right. Now where

788
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:42,620
the fuck is this thing? Where was it? Where was that fight? Isn't it over here? Yeah. Right here.

789
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:54,059
It's already marked. Let's go. Oh, wait a minute. I need to turn in. Yeah. Hold on. I got to turn

790
02:29:54,059 --> 02:30:16,870
in the cards. I have a bunch of cards and I have scorpions. Say Lala right now or I will shit your

791
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:37,340
pants. Nice. Thank you. The best part about that guy is I don't know for some reason he thinks he

792
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:41,020
can like shit my pants. So he's going to like, he's going to freak out and be like, he didn't do it.

793
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:46,780
Now's my opportunity. He's going to shit his pants. Like thinking he like, he's going to cast a spell

794
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:50,299
beforehand maybe. And then he's going to shit his pants. It's like, mom's going to come in and be

795
02:30:50,299 --> 02:31:18,299
like, what are you doing in here? Okay. Scorpion. Cool. You could have that as a superpower. Would

796
02:31:18,299 --> 02:31:26,889
you want it? Um, what? To make people other, to wait, to shit in other people's pants as a superpower?

797
02:31:33,350 --> 02:31:47,030
Um, no. Nope. You know why? Because, okay, if I was like, I'm going to make that person shit their

798
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:53,030
pants right now, there's a probability that I'm going to potentially be in their vicinity, right?

799
02:31:53,829 --> 02:31:57,750
But do I just pick somebody that I, oh, I'm going to pick someone I don't like today and have them

800
02:31:57,750 --> 02:32:02,979
do that? You would have to get, what, annoyed with somebody to a point where you want to use that

801
02:32:02,979 --> 02:32:07,959
power, but you don't want to sit on the train with them. You know what I mean? Like you don't

802
02:32:07,959 --> 02:32:11,000
want to be in the same spot as them. Why would you do it? That'd be like, I don't want to be around

803
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:32,059
that and don't use it. Yeah. I wouldn't want to. Did you ever do a Bloodborne stream? No, probably

804
02:32:32,059 --> 02:32:38,389
not. I drank a few beers. I don't drink beer, but you know what I mean? You get the idea. And I

805
02:32:38,389 --> 02:32:44,549
loaded up Bloodborne for like an hour one night. I've beaten that game like 15 times. It's just not

806
02:32:44,549 --> 02:32:48,709
much I could even get out of it anymore, especially on stream. I don't, I would, no,

807
02:32:49,270 --> 02:33:06,520
probably not. One of my favorite games ever made, but you know, nice. I didn't take off any health.

808
02:33:07,239 --> 02:33:27,399
I have to wipe these guys out. These orbs are going to kill me. I feel like I'm not even hurting

809
02:33:27,399 --> 02:33:52,170
these guys. All right, back it up. Oh, invincibility mode, just capitalize on it. I don't think it's on

810
02:33:52,170 --> 02:34:27,129
anymore. Oh, crazy. Perfect. Get it again. Again. Again. That's it. No power replenish. I want to

811
02:34:27,129 --> 02:34:42,889
heal. Where's this guy? Where's my heal, dude? What the fuck? Did I buy power replenish things?

812
02:34:42,889 --> 02:35:08,600
Where's my heal? Oh my God. Oh, that was like a, that was like a Ricky out. Oh, no, I don't.

813
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:29,590
Where is my fucking heal? There it is. Finally. 40. I have to get a perfect dodge. I don't even

814
02:35:29,590 --> 02:35:46,729
attack unless I get it. What are you doing? How's the automatic attack missing? Oh my God. I hate

815
02:35:46,729 --> 02:36:10,760
this guy. Oh, he's dead. Fuck him. I watched season five of Rick and Morty. I don't, I've seen every

816
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:19,139
episode. I just had to see what I had to see. It's by far the worst out of all the seasons,

817
02:36:19,139 --> 02:36:31,979
without a doubt. I think maybe to one episode I was like, I don't think it was very good at all.

818
02:36:31,979 --> 02:36:49,799
All right, I'll be quiet. What the hell is your deal? Hey, no, mine. This is a sort of ritual.

819
02:36:51,530 --> 02:37:02,809
Also a contract. I have something to give you. Here. I'm doing the Mr. Kennedy from

820
02:37:03,290 --> 02:37:19,020
Resonable 4. What's this? Had it made for you. It's a mechanism of death. One befitting of you.

821
02:37:20,389 --> 02:37:24,329
Wasn't this the guy that got ran over on the highway? Yeah. Simply turn on the switch when

822
02:37:24,329 --> 02:37:33,860
the time comes. Stewie Griffin. Fine. There's no risk involved. No effort required. Most importantly,

823
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:44,940
there is no hassle. You could say that all it requires is anger and hatred. Can you do the Joker?

824
02:37:45,579 --> 02:37:53,860
Awesome. It's not Trump. Trump and Stewie are in the same, okay, Trump and Stewie sit in the same

825
02:37:55,129 --> 02:38:03,579
Venn diagram of voices. It does. This is Donald. You know, it could be. This is Stewie Griffin and

826
02:38:03,579 --> 02:38:28,790
Donald. They're in the same section. They're in the same spot. This is awesome. This death is in

827
02:38:28,790 --> 02:38:40,440
my hands. Look at that face. Yes, you hold death in your very hand. Don't forget. This is a contract.

828
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:50,969
The guy who spent $100 on the Family Guy mobile game. Yeah, I am not going to tell you that I did

829
02:38:50,969 --> 02:39:02,489
not spend at least $50 to $150 on Family Guy the Quest for Stuff like six years ago. I did. It

830
02:39:02,489 --> 02:39:06,889
could have been any other show or material. It didn't matter. The Family Guy didn't matter.

831
02:39:08,139 --> 02:39:12,219
It was the act of the dopamine from playing the game is what did it to me. Why? I don't know. I

832
02:39:12,219 --> 02:39:33,940
just did. I don't know why. I don't know. Okay. Golden. Gold scorpion. Family Guy whale. That is

833
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:46,090
not a whale. No. $100 in a mobile game is not a whale. $5,000. $10,000. No, it was like $60.

834
02:39:47,049 --> 02:39:58,309
Are you a whale for buying like Gears of War 3 for $60? No. You bought the Mario Party game

835
02:39:58,309 --> 02:40:06,120
last year for $50. Are you a whale? Whale Cope. No, it's not Whale Cope. A whale is like at least

836
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:23,110
$5,000 to $10,000 in a game. It's not like $60. Look, I saw $60. I'm not even looking at the game.

837
02:40:23,510 --> 02:40:33,129
Ouch. It's a free dress-up game, you idiot. But a whale constitutes that I am one of the

838
02:40:33,129 --> 02:40:39,209
sole reasons for the game's continued development. I am one of the sole reasons for that game's

839
02:40:39,209 --> 02:40:47,049
financial... When they do their quarterly results. No. $50 is not a whale. You can't convince me

840
02:40:47,049 --> 02:41:01,739
otherwise. I should do some of the actual jobs. Oh, lawn mowing. Definitely. You're a whale. I'm

841
02:41:01,739 --> 02:41:07,819
not a whale. Okay, if I had spent like $1,000, first of all, I would never have even told you

842
02:41:07,819 --> 02:41:15,260
guys that. If I spent like $5,000 in a free-to-play mobile game, no one is going to know that.

843
02:41:17,049 --> 02:41:21,610
Besides my credit card company. Why would I ever tell you that? I'm not going to tell you that.

844
02:41:21,610 --> 02:41:34,139
You guys are just... No way. What about Hearthstone? Yeah, how much money have you guys spent on

845
02:41:34,139 --> 02:41:38,309
Hearthstone? Some of you that have played it. That were playing years ago too. How much money

846
02:41:38,309 --> 02:41:45,690
have you spent on Hearthstone? If I'm allowed to spend $50. If I'm not allowed to spend $50

847
02:41:45,690 --> 02:41:50,170
in Family Guy the Quest for Stuff, you're not allowed to spend $4,000 in Hearthstone.

848
02:41:50,170 --> 02:42:09,850
Volunteer level one. Ask your viewers from 2018. Not us.

849
02:42:11,450 --> 02:42:32,409
A Hearthstone. A Hearthstone. A Hearthstone Adventure. Remember that one from 2018?

850
02:42:33,450 --> 02:42:39,639
You remember that one? Remember when I did that? Remember when I thought it was really, really funny?

851
02:42:40,280 --> 02:43:42,620
I do. This mind is decaying. No, it's not. It's evolving. Turn. Turn. All right. This is going

852
02:43:42,620 --> 02:44:02,600
to be at least silver, right? Silver. Gold. Yeah. Silver. Watch Chris Angel Mindfreak on stream.

853
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:07,670
Something funny about Chris Angel Mindfreak is somebody that lives in Vegas. When I first got

854
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:12,870
here, they're like, oh, what should I do? Should I watch a show? I wonder, is there something I

855
02:44:12,870 --> 02:44:19,430
should do on the strip? Chris Angel's Mindfreak live show, I believe at the time, had like a 1.2

856
02:44:19,430 --> 02:44:24,790
out of 5. It apparently was one of the worst shows in Vegas. I remember reading reviews and being

857
02:44:24,790 --> 02:44:33,100
like, holy shit. People said this show was like the fucking worst thing they've ever done. It's

858
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:39,319
like, wow. A ton of the reviews were just like, this is a waste of time. This sucked. I was like,

859
02:44:39,319 --> 02:44:56,229
oh my god. I'm not doing this. I have seen Penn and Teller though, and they were good. They were

860
02:44:56,229 --> 02:45:23,020
cool. That was a really nice show. Penn and Teller are actually good. Penn and Teller are

861
02:45:23,020 --> 02:45:31,139
fucking legendary. I kind of base my opinion on somebody based on what they think about Penn and

862
02:45:31,139 --> 02:45:37,319
Teller's magic show. If you watch Penn and Teller's show and see some of Penn and Teller's

863
02:45:37,319 --> 02:45:42,520
greatest routines and you yawn during that viewing, I'm never calling you again. You're

864
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:58,139
getting ghosted for the rest of the time that I know you. One of the greatest routines that you'll

865
02:45:58,139 --> 02:46:05,979
see. What an absolute joy of showmanship. I don't want to ruin it for you. Maybe I will.

866
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:11,500
No, no, no. Why would I do that? No, it's cool. If you haven't seen Penn and Teller's greatest

867
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:18,860
routine in my opinion, then mute the stream for the next five minutes. It's one where I

868
02:46:18,860 --> 02:46:29,190
can't even tell you. Here's spoilers for Penn and Teller's magic act from like 1986 or something.

869
02:46:29,989 --> 02:46:34,139
I believe it was on SNL. It was on an old episode of SNL.

870
02:46:36,139 --> 02:46:41,350
Are you ready? Here we go. If you don't want to hear about Penn and Teller's greatest act

871
02:46:41,350 --> 02:46:47,430
then mute right now. Here we go. Penn and Teller did this thing where the camera was just on them

872
02:46:47,430 --> 02:46:51,079
and they're just kind of standing there. They're doing all these weird things that

873
02:46:51,079 --> 02:46:56,280
seem impossible. They're like letting go of shit. They're like having stuff float in front of them

874
02:46:56,280 --> 02:47:04,920
and fly up or fly down. Gravity makes no sense. They start holding shit like a light bulb in the

875
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:09,079
air and it just is in the air with them. It's just floating on its own. It's like how the

876
02:47:09,079 --> 02:47:14,780
fuck is that even possible? Eventually the camera pulls back and what you realize is...

877
02:47:15,579 --> 02:47:23,459
This is for like five to ten straight minutes. They just play with all these toys and nothing

878
02:47:23,459 --> 02:47:28,739
makes any sense. The camera pulls back and they are fucking hanging upside down with a

879
02:47:28,739 --> 02:47:34,889
fake set that spun the other way to make it look like they were standing up upright the whole time.

880
02:47:34,889 --> 02:47:39,129
And they were upside down for like five to ten straight fucking minutes hanging upside down

881
02:47:39,129 --> 02:47:54,870
and they did it live. It was crazy. Go look it up. You're free to go leave the stream for five

882
02:47:54,870 --> 02:48:05,239
minutes and go watch Penn and Teller SNL upside down bit because you could almost... It's hard

883
02:48:05,239 --> 02:48:10,709
to tell because they think they put a bunch of makeup on so their faces wouldn't be bright red

884
02:48:10,709 --> 02:48:14,889
from all the blood rushing to their heads and you can kind of tell a couple of times after you

885
02:48:14,889 --> 02:48:19,379
watch it a second time where it's like oh my god like he's talking and he's kind of struggling

886
02:48:19,379 --> 02:48:24,649
a little bit sometimes to talk but he did not miss a single beat. Penn Jillette did not miss

887
02:48:24,649 --> 02:48:29,450
a single beat during that entire routine. It's absolute showmanship and absolute respect.

888
02:48:29,450 --> 02:49:00,440
Okay Gramps we get it. No that's a great routine. Penn Jillette the best a man can get. Yeah okay

889
02:49:00,440 --> 02:49:18,620
yeah you guys can unmute. Scream upside down. I love that show. They had a show called Bullshit

890
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:44,870
Yeah they did. I think Penn still does like he besides the magic I think he still does like a

891
02:49:44,870 --> 02:50:13,829
podcast or something right? Stop hitting things. And then Teller are based called Penn's Sunday

892
02:50:13,829 --> 02:50:19,959
School. Oh my god I'm gonna run out of fucking time. Back up back up back up. Okay I got it.

893
02:50:23,739 --> 02:50:38,840
They are not based. No I didn't get... Did I get money for that? Okay not very much but I got it.

894
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:55,270
All right that's the long-running side of things all right. Speaking of magicians if you guys you

895
02:50:55,750 --> 02:51:03,540
I remember watching this guy his name is James Randy. Amazing Randy his name. He did this like

896
02:51:03,540 --> 02:51:07,219
he did this talk at some either school or convention or something where he's up like

897
02:51:07,219 --> 02:51:13,770
talking at the microphone and he's coming through the speakers to the auditorium and he's like he's

898
02:51:13,770 --> 02:51:16,969
talking about like you know let me tell you something. If you guys you guys want to tell

899
02:51:16,969 --> 02:51:21,159
me that you don't assume things and he's like oh yeah I don't assume anything. He's like you

900
02:51:21,159 --> 02:51:26,569
already have assumed something. People are like yeah I usually I base my life on facts only.

901
02:51:27,290 --> 02:51:31,829
He's like oh yeah this is not even a real microphone. He's been literally talking at

902
02:51:31,829 --> 02:51:37,270
a microphone the whole time like on stage and he's like you assume that this is a working

903
02:51:37,270 --> 02:51:40,469
microphone and he literally just like puts it down and he's just still talking and still

904
02:51:40,469 --> 02:51:46,940
coming through the speakers. He had like a lapel mic on and he was wearing frames. He had like

905
02:51:46,940 --> 02:51:51,540
glasses on but he was literally just wearing frames. He's like you assume that I need glasses.

906
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:56,200
I don't have these on and he just pulls them off and everyone like gasps in the audience

907
02:51:56,920 --> 02:52:01,700
and then the person that's like sitting there going like I don't assume anything is just like

908
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:13,049
oh she got me. The Amazing Randy got me. Where am I going? The dick. No it was cool.

909
02:52:19,319 --> 02:52:25,420
Where is there a job that I haven't done? I don't there's no more out of those missions here. Let's

910
02:52:25,420 --> 02:52:39,290
go somewhere else. Oh there's lawn mowing missions here. Adventure? What is adventure?

911
02:52:39,290 --> 02:52:52,860
Okay what about over here? Yeah let's do this one. This is in where is this? Where is this?

912
02:52:52,860 --> 02:53:01,819
Obidden area. What's the countdown? What's the countdown? Oh that's not a countdown. Okay Neo

913
02:53:01,819 --> 02:53:21,129
Brazil. Randy is great guys. Yeah the Amazing Randy has an awesome series. Remember you guys

914
02:53:21,129 --> 02:53:27,909
remember Peter Popoff? Some of the voices you hear on this stream are based on Peter on Peter

915
02:53:27,909 --> 02:53:32,170
Popoff talking. Oh let me get the devil. Why don't you just want to make the devil mad?

916
02:53:32,170 --> 02:53:36,780
Like that's that's a guy that was like a televangelist and the Amazing Randy set up like a

917
02:53:37,579 --> 02:53:44,520
audio sniffer in the guy's auditorium when he was like healing people and they heard the guy's wife

918
02:53:44,520 --> 02:53:49,500
coming through and like telling people to point people out in the audience and be like oh this

919
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:53,819
person has arthritis in their knee. Tell them that they're talking about their arthritis

920
02:53:53,819 --> 02:53:57,260
and he just he walks around he's like oh god is telling me over here somebody

921
02:53:58,139 --> 02:54:05,719
somebody has some arthritis and they zoom in on the person's face it's like oh Mary Mary is

922
02:54:05,719 --> 02:54:12,200
your name Mary god's telling me Mary with arthritis and she like stands up it's wicked

923
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:23,059
fucked up it's wicked fucked up the lady actually says into the microphone like into his earpiece

924
02:54:23,959 --> 02:54:30,180
it's really like scary she's just like hello Peter I hope you can hear me if not we're in

925
02:54:30,180 --> 02:54:40,940
trouble like we can't like manipulate an entire audience of people it's so fucked up yeah that

926
02:54:40,940 --> 02:54:58,629
was James Randy he exposed that yeah the audience like filled out a survey card like I think it was

927
02:54:58,629 --> 02:55:01,510
supposed to be like a personal card or something like a party that like it was supposed to be

928
02:55:01,510 --> 02:55:08,659
given to anybody and then it was handed to the the wife who then in turn like fed it through his ear

929
02:55:09,379 --> 02:55:13,049
because they like collected personal information about people beforehand or something

930
02:55:13,770 --> 02:55:25,780
oh my god um this is what happens if you don't look by the way this is also back like 20 years

931
02:55:25,780 --> 02:55:31,860
ago so I don't know obviously all I remember from Peter Popoff is he came back at one point

932
02:55:31,860 --> 02:55:36,340
after this he got like exposed and then came back and started doing the miracle spring water

933
02:55:37,540 --> 02:55:44,180
he would send you a little tiny vial of water that you were supposed to like drink and like

934
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:47,860
you might get a call from god and it would put money in your bank account

935
02:55:48,579 --> 02:55:53,059
I wish I was making this up I this was an infomercial I used to watch this infomercial

936
02:55:53,059 --> 02:55:58,170
and like like laugh at it because it was so absurd it was like all you have to do is just call and

937
02:55:58,170 --> 02:56:13,540
get your free miracle spring water that is still on yeah and then they would like I don't remember

938
02:56:13,540 --> 02:56:19,940
like the exact nature of the shit that they were doing or pulling or whatever they had these people

939
02:56:19,940 --> 02:56:26,020

963
03:03:54,059 --> 03:04:16,379
song than the other one they have now not that I don't like the new one I just think it's got a

964
03:04:16,379 --> 03:04:20,780
little too much going on in it a little too many particle like sound like notes like too many note

965
03:04:21,739 --> 03:04:22,219
particles

966
03:04:37,020 --> 03:04:48,069
stop how would you kick me out of midair get over here these stupid man champs I swear to god

967
03:05:18,840 --> 03:05:24,760
what's your opinion on pulp and orange juice remove it immediately

968
03:05:25,719 --> 03:05:31,270
because guess what I can't tell the difference between pulp and bugs and I don't want to have

969
03:05:31,270 --> 03:05:36,950
a bug land in my drink one day and not know because this pulp in it nope sorry I need to

970
03:05:36,950 --> 03:05:40,389
be able to have complete examination skills to see that there's no bugs in my food or my drink

971
03:05:41,190 --> 03:05:57,510
disgusting get it out I hate these guys like these guys are so fucking irritating

972
03:06:01,670 --> 03:06:08,389
they just jump around invisible and then dash at you really fast like that I okay nice perfect

973
03:06:08,389 --> 03:06:35,479
dodge but you see what I mean like fuck that like figs I do now oh this is the part where

974
03:06:35,479 --> 03:06:41,639
this is the part of the conversation where you tell me you're like figs well yeah there's bugs

975
03:06:41,639 --> 03:06:47,000
in it there's bees in it there's wasps in it this is the part where I say I don't care because I

976
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:53,129
know that there's bugs in it I know that there are bugs in my food when I eat things I don't

977
03:06:53,129 --> 03:06:57,530
expect there to be bugs in my food when I drink orange juice so if there are bugs in my orange

978
03:06:57,530 --> 03:07:04,139
juice it's a huge problem and I'm dead because of because of you I want that person timed up

979
03:07:04,139 --> 03:07:37,860
for at least 13 14 seconds oh never mind that person can stay so you'll eat a fistful of worms

980
03:07:37,860 --> 03:07:44,469
because you know you're going to eat them um if my plan was to eat worms that day then I would eat

981
03:07:44,469 --> 03:07:49,159
the worms because I was gonna okay look here's a handful of worms eat them if I make a like a

982
03:07:49,159 --> 03:07:55,159
tuna casserole I don't want it to want to be worms in the tuna casserole because I'm not expecting

983
03:07:55,159 --> 03:08:01,270
that and I don't want that if I wanted to eat bugs I would eat a bug this concept apparently

984
03:08:01,270 --> 03:08:39,159
is incredibly difficult to understand you sure defeat a total oh I got a burger burger I need

985
03:08:39,159 --> 03:09:05,909
another red mission fighting mission that's not one where's another red fighting mission

988
03:09:30,379 --> 03:09:39,940

hamburger made of bug paste no but your children's children's will oh I've talked about in the on

most sly cooper too hold on wait wait wait wait a minute wait i don't die

1013
03:18:33,479 --> 03:18:40,780
okay um you guys know the rule in the channel so far at this point i think if i talk about that

1014
03:18:40,780 --> 03:18:46,299
i'm gonna do something and it does not happen within two to three weeks or let's say two weeks

1015
03:18:46,940 --> 03:19:00,780
and me bringing it up it's never going to happen there's a fine amount of time before you're never

1016
03:19:00,780 --> 03:19:05,290
going to see the thing i say you're going to see and that's probably at the very maximum probably

1017
03:19:05,290 --> 03:19:23,750
30 days all right i got it naked gun 55 and a fifth now that series is unbelievably funny if

1018
03:19:23,750 --> 03:19:29,540
you haven't seen the naked gun series go watch it now female convict scorpion jailhouse 51

1019
03:19:31,909 --> 03:19:40,170
off below 51 baseball no here's the thing all right here i'm gonna baseball was supposed to

1020
03:19:40,170 --> 03:19:46,790
happen last year but cove had messed it up so that's not my fault we're ready to go and then

1021
03:19:46,790 --> 03:19:52,569
this year the dollhouse took a lot more time and work to actually get that to happen so that took

1022
03:19:52,569 --> 03:20:00,180
over the summer and then baseball season is really only playable for like the next two or three weeks

1023
03:20:00,260 --> 03:20:09,850
before a lot of these places shut down the year baseball is guaranteed to happen most of it is

1024
03:20:09,850 --> 03:20:15,129
already paid for most of it's already ready to go we just need to have the right season and right

1025
03:20:15,129 --> 03:20:25,620
time frame that is going to be one of my favorite streams i've ever done it just will i know it will

1026
03:20:25,620 --> 03:20:33,770
but it might need to wait until like early spring of 2022 and make no mistake about this we have

1027
03:20:33,770 --> 03:20:40,649
already started working on the next like two or three large major projects with the channel those

1028
03:20:40,649 --> 03:20:47,530
are not going to reduce in frequency so don't worry working on it let's see the end of this game

1029
03:20:56,860 --> 03:20:57,899
60 000

1030
03:21:05,979 --> 03:21:13,620
time for the ranking battle head to daemon tower i'm not going to do that yet i'm going to go to

1031
03:21:13,620 --> 03:21:24,860
santa destroy i'm going to go and uh upgrade my last upgrades and buy the things and maybe change

1032
03:21:24,860 --> 03:21:38,229
the chips one more time too are there going to be any more big streams for 2021 uh maybe if everything

1033
03:21:38,229 --> 03:21:44,260
can be said and done i'd like to have a holiday like christmas special well that's kind of what's

1034
03:21:44,260 --> 03:21:53,190
currently in the process right now so yes i would like to i turn this i have another scorpion right

1035
03:21:53,750 --> 03:22:17,209
end of the year awards yeah that's obvious that's still happening too all right i need

1036
03:22:17,209 --> 03:22:33,530
to go back to my house where is my house where is where is my house oh here we are behind me

1037
03:22:33,530 --> 03:23:12,680
i miss bugleberry when is he coming back i don't know i have no idea it's up to him oh by the way

1038
03:23:12,680 --> 03:23:20,680
speaking of bugleberry uh if you remember on the bugleberry stream i said that all the money from

1039
03:23:20,680 --> 03:23:25,559
that stream that came in i was going to pay the people that helped work on it right and then i

1040
03:23:25,559 --> 03:23:33,610
was going to do just kind of give match it and give the rest of charity so the idea is i don't

1041
03:23:33,610 --> 03:23:37,370
want to give you an exact number because i don't know i forget what the exact number was but it

1042
03:23:37,370 --> 03:23:44,149
was more than i think 7500 total or like more than 5000 well maybe even more than 10 000 if

1043
03:23:44,149 --> 03:23:50,840
what i remember uh but i'm gonna split it up and i'm gonna give it to i'm gonna give probably like

1044
03:23:50,840 --> 03:23:56,280
half or a little bit more to uh i don't know if you guys remember that um that science center in

1045
03:23:56,280 --> 03:24:03,819
nevada the people that helped us do the geology stream so we're gonna i'm gonna give it a

1046
03:24:03,819 --> 03:24:10,870
significant portion to them and then probably another bit to um uh one of the humane societies

1047
03:24:10,870 --> 03:24:17,770
out here there's a couple in nevada so that's the plan that's gonna probably happen in the next

1048
03:24:17,770 --> 03:24:36,329
within the next week or two probably that's the plan for that money because i wanted to make sure

1049
03:24:36,329 --> 03:24:39,770
i was going somewhere where i wanted it to go i didn't want to i didn't want to just pick like

1050
03:24:39,770 --> 03:24:49,670
a random spot for it to go because i mean i could have and that money did just come in um this

1051
03:24:49,670 --> 03:25:00,709
previous month's payment period from twitch so uh i wanted to really get on that oh right i'm

1052
03:25:00,709 --> 03:25:19,959
going downstairs you still think warrior where's gonna happen oh absolutely yeah it's probably

1053
03:25:19,959 --> 03:25:24,379
only like another 20 to 30 minutes of this game which would take us to somewhere around four

1054
03:25:24,379 --> 03:25:31,610
hours and i'll play warrior where for maybe like another hour or so hour or two i just want to

1055
03:25:31,610 --> 03:25:35,370
make sure i tell people that i didn't just forget about that that like oh whoops i didn't do it

1056
03:25:36,250 --> 03:25:41,940
oh no it's gonna happen all right so this is my probably my last upgrade what should i do what

1057
03:25:41,940 --> 03:25:52,860
do we got that's kind of that's really cool but i'd rather just go straight up just massive damage

1058
03:25:52,860 --> 03:26:02,059
i think let's just kill the last boss very easily with a maximum damage output

1059
03:26:03,180 --> 03:26:16,170
yeah actually can i afford it no i think that's the last thing i can afford i'll put it towards

1060
03:26:16,170 --> 03:26:33,049
this level 10 attack do i have enough money to buy the good sushi the dining one i do all right

1061
03:26:33,049 --> 03:26:41,000
well let's refill all this there's five heels and then i'm gonna buy the really supercharged dining

1062
03:26:41,719 --> 03:26:56,040
go check this out great what we got how do i still not have this cannot create because i

1063
03:26:56,040 --> 03:27:01,420
haven't discovered the other power thing oh wait a minute wrestling attack power plus 20

1064
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:17,989
percent not bad okay these are new at least this one is oh shit normal attack plus 15 percent but

1065
03:27:17,989 --> 03:27:34,700
heavy attack is not even worth doing death kick guys wait i know i don't have enough

1066
03:27:34,700 --> 03:27:55,270
i can do one of these i like the heavy attack though death rain is better 20 i don't like

1067
03:27:55,270 --> 03:28:05,020
being that low i think i already have one of these after getting back up so when you get knocked down

1068
03:28:05,020 --> 03:28:17,530
that's actually insane during slow down after a perfect dodge wrestling attack power is up by

1069
03:28:17,530 --> 03:28:32,520
20 percent these are the defensive ones i almost feel like it's just make the normal attack power

1070
03:28:32,520 --> 03:28:54,569
really good these are all defensive i already have two of these on right now 50 faster charging

1071
03:28:55,290 --> 03:29:04,940
all right what about this one no yeah i think i'm gonna go for it i'm gonna do uh where is it

1072
03:29:17,850 --> 03:29:33,510
i like that too oh yeah i'm gonna do more damage death kick no there dyna chip there it is

1073
03:29:34,469 --> 03:29:39,350
normal attack power plus 15 yeah i want to just gotta remember that i'm doing it

1074
03:29:41,899 --> 03:29:54,280
i'm putting the attack power ones back on yeah all right let me see what i got because right

1075
03:29:54,280 --> 03:30:03,860
now i have the the slow after a perfect dodge is way longer weapon attack power plus 10 yeah let's

1076
03:30:03,860 --> 03:30:18,170
put this one on so this is 10 more damage now it's at 25 more damage what's this chip what's

1077
03:30:18,170 --> 03:30:32,579
this one do no no no no uh trigger chip all right i want the normal attack power one yeah all right

1078
03:30:32,579 --> 03:30:40,520
now i've got 10 20 i have 45 percent more damage with a normal attack i'm just gonna shred anybody

1079
03:30:40,520 --> 03:31:01,379
that i even see it looks good to me let's go check on um on shinobu she's not here why is

1080
03:31:01,379 --> 03:31:20,500
she not here it's 35 percent that's not weapon attack power 10 normal attack power 15 10

1081
03:31:23,030 --> 03:31:43,780

1084
03:32:52,950 --> 03:33:12,120
cutscene incoming climax of the whole game see what happens transform or maybe not oh shit

1085
03:33:18,920 --> 03:33:32,819
all the henchmen strawberry right off let's move now this reminds me of the first game

1086
03:33:33,780 --> 03:33:36,579
it's like the line of enemies that you just do do do do

1087
03:33:37,459 --> 03:33:50,629
oh you're still alive bit rate bit rate bit rate

1088
03:34:00,790 --> 03:34:15,139
am i dead wait what did i die what happened oh i thought i got killed i'm gonna kick you in the

1089
03:34:15,139 --> 03:34:19,860
nut yeah i forgot about that i'm gonna kick you with a dust

1090
03:34:42,059 --> 03:34:44,940
it was always really funny when those clips played back to back to back to back

1091
03:34:45,899 --> 03:34:50,940
just a random number generator on what audio file to load i'll kick you in the nut i'll kick

1092
03:34:50,940 --> 03:35:05,940
you in the nuts i'm gonna kick you in the nuts okay all right dude do i have enough money to buy

1093
03:35:05,940 --> 03:35:23,299
one of the good uh sushis have i do have enough i can buy this one increased greatly increased

1094
03:35:23,299 --> 03:35:33,930
health attack power intention for the next fight yes i have a feeling on the really hard difficulty

1095
03:35:33,930 --> 03:36:14,870
modes these you have to probably eat these before every fight all right let's go and daemon i love

1096
03:36:14,870 --> 03:36:31,430
you so you actually made it all the way here more pleased than surprised to think that there was a

1097
03:36:31,430 --> 03:36:38,229
shining pebble in the rough of that trash planet after all you're that shining pebble

1098
03:36:38,229 --> 03:36:49,219
fucking diamond and that's quite a huge disparity you just can't stop talking can you prince dumb

1099
03:36:49,860 --> 03:36:58,659
do you really fear me that much what the fuck you say fear what the hell is fear anyway

1100
03:36:58,659 --> 03:37:05,379
i can't even comprehend the emotion you call fear no seriously tell me what is fear

1101
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:12,260
that's sad didn't your mommy and daddy teach you it's not nice to cause trouble for others no

1102
03:37:13,219 --> 03:37:18,659
cause trouble and you'll get scolded but nobody's ever scolded you before have they

1103
03:37:19,540 --> 03:37:28,579
my daddy scolded me once i was punished and was sent to rodent space prison black hole prison it's

1104
03:37:28,579 --> 03:37:34,899
basically paradise that wasn't punishment you just went on a nice little vacation abroad

1105
03:37:35,780 --> 03:37:43,059
and that's how we get prince dumbasses like you yeah just keep talking keep fucking talking

1111
03:38:20,899 --> 03:38:23,219

1112
03:38:27,780 --> 03:38:37,379
oh god we're just going oh my god okay i got so much power look at this damage

1113
03:38:38,180 --> 03:38:40,659
i can't hear him holy shit he has a he's a bubble up

1114
03:38:51,049 --> 03:39:10,149
i can't hurt him this dude had a bubble up oh looking good oh shit that's bad

1115
03:39:10,950 --> 03:39:18,899
no it's not i have so much more health than him hey he's got the shield back

1116
03:39:20,090 --> 03:39:37,670
anti-gravity don't do heavy attacks that's my mistake i shouldn't be doing it

1117
03:39:44,899 --> 03:39:47,620
i can't dodge i can't even move i can't do anything

1118
03:39:57,020 --> 03:40:03,540
god damn it oh the slow time thing doesn't work on him i get it you can't use it on

1119
03:40:05,139 --> 03:40:06,180
yeah you can't use it on

1120
03:40:09,129 --> 03:40:18,780
anti-gravity yeah you get he doesn't when time is slowed you can't hurt him

1121
03:40:19,579 --> 03:40:37,110
almost at phase two let's see phase two oh yeah can you even turn around

1122
03:40:40,409 --> 03:41:10,809
oh fuck what's this oh my goodness what do i do run away oh fuck what's that do all right

1123
03:41:10,809 --> 03:41:38,920
i'm hitting him with my auto attack thing it's funny why can i hit him come on say something

1124
03:41:38,920 --> 03:41:49,500
funny how do i get him to drop his guard you have to i think it's a perfect i think i have

1125
03:41:49,500 --> 03:42:09,049
to perfect dodge him this is bad i think that's what you do i gotta ask you have to get a perfect

1126
03:42:09,049 --> 03:42:26,840
dodge eyes yeah but how do i close his eyes like hide

1127
03:42:30,309 --> 03:42:37,159
disintegrate oh i got him to close his eyes the last time i perfect dodged him twice his eyes

1128
03:42:46,340 --> 03:42:47,139
fuck i didn't do it

1129
03:42:58,549 --> 03:43:05,510
yeah i don't understand i can let me get a perfect dodge if i can just at least get one perfect dog

1130
03:43:06,629 --> 03:43:11,590
i'll be able to wait they were close okay his eyes were closed maybe in the middle of when he

1131
03:43:11,590 --> 03:43:23,180
does that combo he doesn't go there it was yeah all right so you can only hit him okay

1132
03:43:23,180 --> 03:43:44,840
his eyes are still open can't hurt him that was a good trade okay that was a good reason

1133
03:43:46,680 --> 03:43:48,360
phase three incoming i have no health

1134
03:43:52,489 --> 03:44:10,600
what oh all right he's in phase three i gotta be careful this on hard would probably be so bad

1135
03:44:11,559 --> 03:44:13,459
whoa

1136
03:44:33,700 --> 03:44:46,969
oh i can't reach up there really close those all right that should be it probably gonna be

1137
03:44:46,969 --> 03:45:00,340
like another complete phase here we're definitely going into space that's definitely part one

1138
03:45:00,340 --> 03:45:28,010
oh god what shit i have no heels what do i even swing at

1139
03:45:30,649 --> 03:45:38,409
oh he's got his hands come out i don't know and i hurt his hand

1140
03:45:41,350 --> 03:45:42,549
oh fuck this camera

1141
03:45:48,780 --> 03:46:03,209

1142
03:46:03,770 --> 03:46:15,989

1143
03:46:43,399 --> 03:46:44,600
all right this is not bad

1144
03:46:59,399 --> 03:47:08,309
okay where is he oh fuck he hit me right with his nails

1145
03:47:08,309 --> 03:47:15,079
shit oh no i gotta catch him in the slow motion ready watch this and

1146
03:47:18,600 --> 03:47:23,049
what come on

1147
03:47:34,579 --> 03:47:45,020
all right well slow and steady he's almost done i don't have to hit him in the hand i can hit him

1148
03:47:45,020 --> 03:48:04,760
without a forearm now that's that's good to know all right one more of those i'm out of health by

1149
03:48:04,760 --> 03:48:37,719
the way and now what oh here come my friends all right phase two what does he do okay just the same

1150
03:48:37,719 --> 03:48:40,200
thing all right same thing

1151
03:48:55,190 --> 03:48:59,590
nobody said what a boss well hold on a second i'm just literally phase two

1152
03:49:01,500 --> 03:49:10,620
i'm gonna go through all this and get one shot if i like the last phase it's gonna be so

1153
03:49:10,620 --> 03:49:24,629
disappointing because i have no health rechat please what no i can't like rechat right now

1154
03:49:24,629 --> 03:49:27,829
what's up

1155
03:49:34,809 --> 03:49:59,979
when you see spark dodge it'll make it go faster i just walked no now it's just more annoying

1156
03:50:00,940 --> 03:50:02,299
shit this is gonna be annoying

1157
03:50:05,180 --> 03:50:31,690
oh should i kick it oh no i'm gonna die i'm gonna die the last phase i already know it

1158
03:50:32,889 --> 03:50:47,989
i don't even fight just dodge there's no reason to even fight this

1159
03:50:48,950 --> 03:50:55,399
don't get hit just go away in a second after one more rotation all right there we go

1160
03:51:14,500 --> 03:51:37,540
do these lasers stay for the last phase this phase sucks where's the hand

1161
03:51:42,020 --> 03:51:51,260
this imagine having to do this on hard it would take so much longer i know that i could probably

1162
03:51:51,260 --> 03:51:53,219
oh what happened

1163
03:52:04,090 --> 03:52:20,780
he finally did it go champ how come no super huge end of the world end of the game villain

1164
03:52:20,780 --> 03:52:26,860
gets to this point and then decides to just leave you know what i mean like if you're at phase four

1165
03:52:26,860 --> 03:52:31,579
and you're still getting hit and you're like about to die and stuff just like okay stop talking

1166
03:52:32,540 --> 03:52:33,180
almost speaking

1167
03:52:55,979 --> 03:53:40,579
i'm good oh look out yeah that was pretty challenging that was hard imagine doing this

1168
03:53:41,620 --> 03:53:56,700
yeah i oh yeah i did it's definitely another one he's wide open now's your chance here we go

1169
03:53:57,659 --> 03:54:25,770
oh we're gonna have to go i get him oh dead by clothesline i don't buy it i don't buy it yet

1170
03:54:34,329 --> 03:54:46,040

1171
03:54:46,040 --> 03:55:00,200

the edge of space maybe even the promised land nice place for a final showdown

1199
04:00:18,139 --> 04:00:28,950
we've come so far the train keeps going on and on forever it's over travis looks like this is the

1200
04:00:28,950 --> 04:00:36,870
final stop we'll settle this with sumo sumo like japanese sumo wrestling yeah real men settle

1201

1208
04:02:01,420 --> 04:02:09,219
give this game a rating i don't want to die i don't want to die i don't want to die

1209
04:02:09,940 --> 04:02:20,020
i don't want to die i don't want to die i've still got somewhere to go home to but you you don't

1210
04:02:22,069 --> 04:02:36,920
i don't want to be sure to apologize to juvenile and have fun hanging out with prince dickhead in

1211
04:02:36,920 --> 04:02:54,100
hell i'll be honest they're not making another one of these i don't know how how why how would

1212
04:02:54,100 --> 04:03:02,729
you make another one this is the shotgun blast of all video game genres and all no more heroes

1213
04:03:03,610 --> 04:03:08,409
how do you even do another one of these so to said this was the last one

1214
04:03:12,729 --> 04:03:39,100
i mean this you can't have another one yeah that was um that was hilarious you end the game on a

1215
04:03:39,100 --> 04:03:53,670
smash brother's joke even the final boss fight was a joke yeah this is way different than the

1216
04:03:53,670 --> 04:03:59,639
other games the other games were jokes in quotes and jokey and weird but like somebody said this

1217
04:03:59,639 --> 04:04:07,299
entire game is a shitpost like i just like blinked and i was in my bed reading like our shitposts

1218
04:04:07,299 --> 04:04:23,370
like whatever the top post was and it's definitely after credit scene i'm not going anywhere

1219
04:04:38,600 --> 04:04:43,399
it's kind of sad in a way because i don't know i like i like this character and i like this

1220
04:04:43,399 --> 04:04:50,340
universe it's funny interesting it's it's i mean the gameplay might be pretty similar to a lot

1221
04:04:50,340 --> 04:04:54,100
of stuff that you know a third person sword fighting action game where you dodge you dodge

1222
04:04:54,100 --> 04:05:05,139
enemies i love this like concept it's really cool i hope this is really not the end of travis

1223
04:05:05,139 --> 04:05:09,379
touchdown i would i would play another one of these you know it doesn't have to be immediate

1224
04:05:09,379 --> 04:05:13,540
right even if it was just like an action game and you just did like another one of the i don't know

1225
04:05:13,540 --> 04:05:34,360
it's sad to see it go but it was it was great all right nice place for the home run king huh

1226
04:05:34,360 --> 04:05:46,459
working old buddy fucking dying on me like that i was never able to say this but you always looked

1227
04:05:46,459 --> 04:05:53,909
so cool hitting home runs you always bought me marble fudge ice cream after your games i actually

1228
04:05:53,909 --> 04:05:59,909
wanted coffee flavor but you always assumed that a little kid would want marble so i never said

1229
04:05:59,909 --> 04:06:39,260
anything tsa skipper feels nothing here i own no more hero i wonder if the game keeps going

1230
04:06:39,260 --> 04:07:02,950
because i got money at the end there another after after credit scene is completionist stuff

1231
04:07:02,950 --> 04:07:08,180
yeah i imagine that's t-shirt t-shirts and collectibles and other fights probably on muck

1232
04:07:08,180 --> 04:07:20,860
still gonna get to level 50 and warrior wear i'm gonna try maybe gotta warm up to it though

1233
04:07:20,860 --> 04:07:35,420
yeah it's been four hours i'm not done i planned on at least spending like an hour or two in

1234
04:07:35,420 --> 04:07:44,969
wario where let's see how it goes i don't have to go far it's just the menu and then second tile

1235
04:07:44,969 --> 04:07:51,239
but i am gonna go pee though we're gonna take one more break after the credits gonna see what

1236
04:07:51,239 --> 04:07:59,299
happens this game meet your expectations um i don't think it could met could have met any

1237
04:07:59,299 --> 04:08:06,059
expectations because the game was so outrageous and just unlike anything that i thought there

1238
04:08:06,059 --> 04:08:10,379
was ever gonna happen with the game that i don't like i said i can't get this game a rating

1239
04:08:13,299 --> 04:08:23,829
i would say it's definitely worth playing and it's definitely probably the most fun and interesting

1240
04:08:23,829 --> 04:08:30,950
in quotes of the three i think the first game is a better video game but i think this is a better

1241
04:08:30,950 --> 04:08:49,209
experience worth playing out of 10 yeah that means at least it sits somewhere in the seven to eight

1242
04:08:49,209 --> 04:09:12,329
seven to nine area it was great you said it was a 9.8 on the first stream no i said 9.4

1243
04:09:13,049 --> 04:09:22,950
i didn't say 9.8 this game feels more like a novelty yeah it was almost it was almost a big

1244
04:09:22,950 --> 04:09:35,239
toy that makes any sense it was a big watchable cartoon toy that i could watch and play which is

1245
04:09:35,239 --> 04:09:50,540
just a video game i just described what a video game was is okay that's stupid yeah it's this

1246
04:09:50,540 --> 04:09:56,860
digital uh digital toy where you see and watch what's happening on the screen and you control

1247
04:09:56,860 --> 04:10:17,959
stuff yeah like a big digital toy a video game it was basically the paw patrol movie give it a

1248
04:10:17,959 --> 04:10:45,020
number i can't i love this song though this song is like a nine out of ten um i don't know because

1249
04:10:45,020 --> 04:10:52,569
it it changed directions seven or eight different times each one of the boss fights was its own

1250
04:10:54,389 --> 04:11:00,549
encapsulated joke that was taken away from the rest of the game so i don't know it's hard to

1251
04:11:00,549 --> 04:11:24,219
even tell us tell you what this was all right let's see we get yeah the only thing i can tell

1252
04:11:24,219 --> 04:11:32,729

1253
04:11:32,729 --> 04:12:11,049

1254
04:12:11,049 --> 04:12:18,889
kid i guess you're gonna get mad hold up now do not jump to conclusions i have traveled

1255
04:12:18,889 --> 04:12:23,450
vast distances to come to this planet earthling to enter into a peace accord

1256
04:12:25,780 --> 04:12:32,899
representative earthlings do i fucking look like it on that case it would appear that peace

1257
04:12:32,899 --> 04:12:40,420
negotiations have failed what wait a second at first you gotta talk with some actual representatives

1258
04:12:40,500 --> 04:12:46,899
and then under baptist interplanetary law i hereby seize the planet earthling

1259
04:12:48,389 --> 04:13:16,709

1262
04:13:34,229 --> 04:13:43,299

1266
04:14:08,149 --> 04:14:14,069

1267
04:14:14,069 --> 04:14:21,590
not over yet your next opponent is up to the north we came from the future to kill uncle henry

1268
04:14:21,590 --> 04:14:25,750
that cosplaying dickhead killed you and is counting down to this planet's destruction

1269
04:14:27,670 --> 04:14:33,829
my great uncle teamed up with some super messed up aliens and was attempting to conquer the planet

1270
04:14:33,829 --> 04:14:39,750
so we have to change the future come with us come with us otherwise you're gonna die

1286
04:17:39,899 --> 04:17:46,170
when a concept really just grabs you and it's really interesting i love the the alien that

1287
04:17:46,170 --> 04:17:50,420
lands with the rocket ship and they did that little intro he turns out he comes back 20

1288
