00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:23,879
Hello. Hey guys, welcome to stream. Welcome to my first ever stream. I've been waiting to try something like that. I don't know. I got a headache. That's why I'm doing this.

2
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:36,429
Oh, he's doing the Sans voice. Hey guys, how are you? Hold on. Hold on a second here. Yeah, sorry we're starting a lot later than usual.

3
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:50,210
But the reason for that... Ooh, let me move you over here. The reason for that is I woke up this morning and just had a really annoying headache.

4
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,210
It didn't really hurt that much, but it was just... it just was there. It just wouldn't go away.

5
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:04,260
It was a pressure headache, so it was just messing with my ability to talk and think and like right in the front of my forehead, you know what I mean?

6
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:20,739
It's called a hangover? I didn't drink anything last night. What? The last time I drank is on this stream. Like last week.

7
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:28,739
I only drink... I really only drink probably like two or three times a month. Maybe. If that.

8
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:47,209
Shoot, what do you mean sure? Every time I drink, you guys see it. Boxed wine? Yeah, but I was building a labo for that. I had to do that.

9
00:01:47,209 --> 00:02:01,969
What about that time that I drank toilet water? Well, I mean, I didn't drink actual toilet water. I was drinking water out of a sink.

10
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:11,189
But tonight, I'll give you a rundown of what we're doing here. So tonight and possibly tomorrow, we're going to stream two days in a row.

11
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:19,370
So Katamari Damacy Reroll, the remake remastering of the original Katamari game just came out.

12
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:28,889
So obviously that was one of my favorite games ever. And what are we even waiting for here? You know what I'm saying?

13
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:45,340
What are we even waiting for? Here it is. All the original music, all the original levels. I played this game as shit.

14
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,699
This is my childhood. And here's the thing, those of you guys who don't know what the fucking title means, sing it with me.

15
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:56,699
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:24,069
Ruined. All right. All right. All right. You know what we're doing. Yeah, this is my childhood, guys.

17
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:34,680
When I grew up, I was probably, I don't know, maybe like probably 20, 22 when this game came out, 23 maybe.

18
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:48,939
And yeah, I grew up with it. I was just a kid. I remember riding my bike around the neighborhood, hanging out with the neighborhood kids.

19
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:56,740
I had a backwards ball cap on, a cool vest with Marty McFly on it. I was like 24.

20
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:15,699
Me and all the other like neighborhood college kids, you know what I mean?

21
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:31,490
Well, how old, what, when do you guys think that you get old? I'm just barely right now. I'm barely like turning into, I'm barely an adult.

22
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:42,379
You don't really become an adult till you're like 38. I'm not there yet. I'm still just a kid.

23
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:51,550
I saw the song from the TV commercials and they told me when I was younger, this is not my fault.

24
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:58,620
Okay. Blame Toys R Us because I don't want to grow up on the Toys R Us kid was what was on TV every fucking day.

25
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,620
And they they were brainwashing me to say, don't ever be an adult. Don't be an adult. Be a kid forever.

26
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:19,850
And I'm like, fuck, man. All right. I guess you barely become an adult when you're 30. I'm just kidding.

27
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:26,600
But we're going to play Katamari tonight and tomorrow. And then we're going to take a day off on what is today.

28
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,899
So Monday, Tuesday, we'll take we'll take Wednesday off and maybe Thursday because Friday is going to be the Birdhouse stream.

29
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:48,779
I'm building a birdhouse. Why don't we just listen to it again? No, we don't need to see it again.

30
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:56,339
Turn it up louder. Here it comes again. What if I just did this for like three hours?

31
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:03,779
Do you agree to these terms and conditions? They weren't terms and conditions in the original game.

32
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:12,149
This is like, this is absolutely a remake. Privacy policy. Didn't have to agree to this shit last time.

33
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:20,579
There he is. Hello, Prince. This is the King. Long time no see.

34
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:26,579
We thought today would be a good day for rolling the Katamari. The Prince.

35
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,579
You want me to read this correctly?

36
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:41,149
Where the first rolls, the second follows. Roll, roll, roll.

37
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:49,389
For that purpose, all alone, we went to the bother, the bother of making this space.

38
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:55,529
The King of all cosmos going to the bother. Just for, I can't read this.

39
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:59,529
It's like too fucking cryptic and all over the place.

40
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:13,199
We went to the bother. They would like for you to start the rolling.

41
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,300
But, but, first things first.

42
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:27,300
But, first things first. Does the Prince like vibration?

43
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Meaning the moving and the shaking.

44
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,569
No, no, no, no. I hate it.

45
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:40,569
Plane is best. I love going on natural.

46
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:46,509
If that's what you say, what you declare.

47
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:53,509
Then you can turn the vibration on and off with the...

48
00:07:53,509 --> 00:08:02,410
All clear, good. We shall see you later.

49
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:08,029
That's slower than I remember. Did the text come on screen that slowly before?

50
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,029
This is a remake.

51
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:15,100
All right, Katamari. If you don't know what Katamari is, it's a game where you roll around a little

52
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:22,100
never-lasting gobstopper and you have to pick up shit. It sticks to the ball as a sticky ball.

53
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:30,160
You use the analogs to turn around, back and forward. You have to roll over everything, pick up stuff.

54
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,159
And you got to make your Katamari huge or as big as the King desires.

55
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,299
Vibration on? I'm not going to put vibration on. I hate vibration. I'm with the King on this one.

56
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:45,389
Vibration sucks.

57
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:51,389
It's a feature that we somehow put on all consoles after its intended purpose was used and done.

58
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:54,759
You guys, listen.

59
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,759
Rumble was the VR from like 1993.

60
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, I'm in the game. Oh, my car just got hit. Whoa, my hands. It was revolutionary. It was insane.

61
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,070
It's not necessary anymore.

62
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,850
Dazzling. We feel a swoon coming over.

63
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:28,049
Vibration? Yeah, it was a peripheral you had to attach to the back of your controller.

64
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:34,679
Phones have vibration too, Boomer.

65
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,679
Yeah, but your phone vibrates to alert you of something. It doesn't vibrate so you're not like walking around

66
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,679
and each step the phone vibrates to pretend like you're walking around somewhere.

67
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:48,679
Like, oh, dude, this is pretty, this is pretty, uh, ooh, I can feel, I'm walking.

68
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,679
I actually am because I vibrate every single time I step. I know I'm walking.

69
00:09:52,679 --> 00:10:07,899
Did somebody just say turn off the music? Wait.

70
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,899
That's like one of the best parts of the whole game.

71
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,899
Please turn off the music.

72
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,899
Look is L.

73
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:25,409
R is jump.

74
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:30,529
Okay, quick turn is...

75
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,529
Okay, so you gotta go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

76
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,529
Let's just charge and roll. Click it to spin around.

77
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,529
Very useful and they're using this a lot.

78
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:49,649
Don't turn it off, beatbox to the scratches.

79
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,730
I've mastered the controls.

80
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:04,960
If you've actually never played this game before, it really is like a wonderful experience.

81
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,960
That's why we're doing it on stream.

82
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:17,899
You wanna talk about like a DLC character for Smash?

83
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,899
Don't put Sora in the fucking game.

84
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:34,529
Everyone's like, oh, Sora for DLC? No, put the king of the cosmos in the game.

85
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,500
What a great character that would be.

86
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,529
It's indeed not a dream. We really didn't. The king of all cosmos has really done it.

87
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,529
A sky full of stars.

88
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:51,519
We broke it.

89
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,519
Yes, we were naughty, completely naughty.

90
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,519
So, so, so very sorry.

91
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,139
But just between you and us, it feels quite good.

92
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:07,600
Not that we can remember very clearly, but we were in all nature's embrace.

93
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,610
We felt the beauty of all things and felt love for all. That's how it was.

94
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,620
Did you see? We smiled a genuine smile. Did you see it?

95
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,879
The stars splintering in perfect beauty.

96
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,879
So many, there used to be almost a nuisance, but there's nothing but darkness.

97
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,250
He. E. He. It is but a dream. E. He.

98
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,250
But a beautiful one.

99
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,059
B. But. Beauty.

100
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,860
That miraculous, fabulous moment has passed. It's over.

101
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,860
We came to and found everyone furious.

102
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,860
Even the king of all cosmos was not spared their wrath. Really, everybody was irate.

103
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,409
Anyway, Pee Wee Prince.

104
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:55,779
Hurry up and bring back the glorious starry sky.

105
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,779
Our problem, your problem. Yeah, you owe us your existence.

106
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:04,049
We collect on the debt. Pee Wee German.

107
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,049
Hand in hand, always there. Yes, the very definition of the father-son bond.

108
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:14,659
Alright then, let's get cracking. Sending things to Earth.

109
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:25,379
The Prince is already in Smash. What? Really?

110
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:31,590
But not the king of the cosmos.

111
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,590
Here we are, Earth. This is the game. Full of things as usual.

112
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,049
So, so small, you're as small as ever.

113
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:43,049
We didn't notice not one jot with what the stars at all.

114
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:47,049
What is that? That body? That physique? Could you really be our son?

115
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:50,590
E. He. I've got it.

116
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,590
Build yourself up while you roll the Katamari. Work out and get bigger.

117
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,590
Yes indeed.

118
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,590
Don't presume to take the escalator up to the throne just because you're the Prince.

119
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,590
Wow. Tangent. Wild tangent.

120
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,590
We didn't go there last time, but that's alright.

121
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,590
First time on Earth means no worrying about time.

122
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,590
We think we'll come and pick you up when that Katamari is ten centimeters.

123
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,590
Just remember, many things live here, scurrying around and generally getting in the way.

124
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,590
When one of these sneaks up behind you, an alert comes up on the lower left.

125
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,590
I love this name. Try not to bump into anything alive.

126
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,590
But don't worry about it too much. It won't end the game or anything, so just relax and roll.

127
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,590
Good luck, inchling Prince.

128
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,590
So, there we go, here we go.

129
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,590
The best part. Ooh, that same thing.

130
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,590
This was the very first thing we ever rolled up.

131
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,590
This dice.

132
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,590
Oh, we feel a little emotional.

133
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,149
We should put this in the diary.

134
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:04,259
Oh, I bumped into the snail.

135
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,769
I'm going to get the blocks of cheese.

136
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,769
Oh, it's all coming back to me, the memories.

137
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:14,710
Get the sandwiches. Oh!

138
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,850
You guys know the Reddit subreddit, like, oddly satisfying?

139
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,559
They actually got all their inspiration from this game.

140
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,559
This whole game is just one giant, oddly satisfying Reddit thread.

141
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:37,259
Just inherently satisfying. What about the cell phones?

142
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,129
No, not big enough for those yet.

143
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,129
Not big enough for the cell phones.

144
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:51,019
The phone text hurt. Get the jello.

145
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,580
Ah, what? It's alive?

146
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,580
The same thing. This was the very first thing we ever collided with.

147
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:08,419
Why can I not pick up the little mounds of jelly?

148
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,360
I'm just nailing it.

149
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,289
Let's make it roll fast.

150
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:17,289
Almost there. Ten centimeters and that's it.

151
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:27,000
Get the blocks.

152
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Eventually you can pick up the biggest stuff in the hole in the room on Earth.

153
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,389
How goes it?

154
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,389
How was Earth, huh?

155
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:39,389
We made a ten centimeter Katamari. How fabulous.

156
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:43,389
We'd forgotten all about that, so you're mostly clearing everything else we see.

157
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,700
Everyone on Earth is very nice, so they'll be very helpful.

158
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,700
They'll let you roll everything up with a smile, yes, possibly also a wave.

159
00:16:50,700 --> 00:17:01,600
Anyway, let's go home for now.

160
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Oh yes, I almost forgot. Completely slipped the mind.

161
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,599
When rolling on Earth, there are a few more things to be careful of.

162
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,839
You cannot roll up objects larger than your Katamari.

163
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,839
Scratching into larger objects and walls will break things of the Katamari and reduce its size.

164
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,839
Things fall off.

165
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,839
Oddly shaped objects will make your Katamari lopsided.

166
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
And fuck it all up.

167
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,980
What? No.

168
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,579
Loud game.

169
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:38,480
There, is that better?

170
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
I'm not doing the... I know how to play the game.

171
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,980
It was the first goal, but it's not the very exciting one, is it?

172
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,049
Next time, we want a much bigger one.

173
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:51,049
The thing that you collected the most of is...

174
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,049
Snacks, stationery, and games.

175
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:56,539
My Earth is really full of things.

176
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,539
We will now release it into the sky.

177
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:03,579
Yeah, you're essentially making stars for the cosmos.

178
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:11,220
Ten centimeters, one millimeter.

179
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,220
Here's the menu. You forgot your own planet.

180
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,930
Really, are you serious? So you're just not just small, but a bit slow too.

181
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,230
I can already see the clips that are coming out from this.

182
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,230
You know?

183
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,539
Like, how many clips have been done in the stream so far?

184
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:32,799
You guys have already clipped 13 things in the tutorial.

185
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,109
We cannot feel but partly responsible.

186
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:42,119
Sai, this is your home planet.

187
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,119
The planet where you live.

188
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,359
Here you can look at stars and save the game and do lots of other things.

189
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,359
You can even visit Earth and the space mushroom.

190
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:53,359
Just by pressing the L and R button.

191
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,660
Roll your Katamari around on Earth, visit the space mushroom to complete against your cousins.

192
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,660
And that's about it. Your smallness to get a grip.

193
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,660
Oh, there's another clip!

194
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
Your absent-mindedness.

195
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
There's another one!

196
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,849
All right, make sure to save.

197
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,849
Make sure you remind me to do that.

198
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:16,970
All right, let's save the game right now.

199
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:22,220
So you guys want the music up or the sound down?

200
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,190
How does that sound?

201
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,190
Is that more tolerable for your ears?

202
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,660
Maybe?

203
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
Uh, data.

204
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,660
Collection.

205
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,470
Control, config.

206
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,660
Presence.

207
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
View, constellations.

208
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
All right, let me go save it.

209
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,009
Select a file.

210
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:50,490
Uh, how about right in the middle?

211
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,920
Louder.

212
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Not louder.

213
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,359
No, don't quit the game.

214
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,359
So, is there anything else I can do in here?

215
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:06,329
I remember somebody was saying that the graphic settings are actually somehow in here.

216
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:07,329
But I'm playing on the Switch.

217
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:09,329
I don't think there are any graphic settings.

218
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:14,690
All right, let's go.

219
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,119
So, let's take a look at the map.

220
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,420
We've got this one.

221
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
This is, uh, our first ever roll.

222
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,430
It's Castella.

223
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,430
And I think now it's time to go to Earth.

224
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:33,509
Here's your world map.

225
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:34,509
Make a star 2.

226
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:36,509
Make a star 1.

227
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,509
Here's the second level.

228
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:40,390
Make a star 2.

229
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,920
What's this?

230
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
I wish I could play the piano.

231
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I would put it on, like, the weird dum-dum chorus thing and just play all day.

232
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:04,150
Because this is just a keyboard with a setting on it.

233
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,490
All right.

234
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,650
Um.

235
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,640
Dang, dang, dang.

236
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Have you ever been to the Philippines?

237
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
We stopped in the day before yesterday.

238
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:26,029
We hope you can visit during the day's rolling like that's possible.

239
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,339
Oh, yes.

240
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:31,579
A royal present for the hard-working prince.

241
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,579
That's what we were thinking.

242
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:35,579
While playing catch with your present.

243
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:36,579
And it went down to Earth.

244
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,579
It just fell to Earth.

245
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:42,140
Must be around somewhere, so roll it up while you're at it.

246
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,490
Sending things to Earth.

247
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,910
Movies.

248
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,910
Programs.

249
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,910
Elephants.

250
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,910
Giraffes.

251
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,910
Sheep.

252
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,089
Alligators.

253
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:59,609
Here we are.

254
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,609
Today you'll be rolling inside the house.

255
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:06,039
The catamari should be, let's see, around a full 20 centimeters.

256
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:09,220
We can believe in you for seven minutes.

257
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
This is the amount of time you have to do it.

258
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,519
But any longer than that, and even the king of all cosmos can't be expected to wait.

259
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:20,529
We look forward to a nice catamari, mini prince.

260
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:22,529
Look at the little rats with the cheese balls.

261
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,539
Here we go.

262
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,630
Why did it, come on.

263
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,630
I'm trying to like do like an interesting intro to the game.

264
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,329
Can't get these.

265
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:36,329
Oh, I can.

266
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,329
I can get the toothpaste.

267
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:42,769
Got to get the small shit first.

268
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,069
Taffy.

269
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:45,069
Get the candy.

270
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,210
I can't get the taffy yet.

271
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,640
Not for the love of God, really.

272
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,890
No orange slices?

273
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,890
Not big enough.

274
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,619
I can get the little marbles.

275
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:04,259
What about these?

276
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,259
Fuck.

277
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,259
Come on.

278
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,259
Nail polish.

279
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,619
No.

280
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:09,619
Matchsticks.

281
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:11,799
I have to get bigger.

282
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,539
Get up.

283
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,930
There we go.

284
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,930
Okay.

285
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,930
Take your own.

286
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,420
Now it's time to roll over everything here.

287
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,730
I'm going to take out the Legos.

288
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,730
And the chocolate cookies.

289
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,759
Can't get the big ones.

290
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,019
Was it one?

291
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,019
20?

292
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,019
20 centimeters?

293
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,500
Oh.

294
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,299
Okay.

295
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:42,299
I can get the nail polish.

296
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,490
I'm going to go up.

297
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:48,619
We did not go up at all.

298
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:49,619
No!

299
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:50,619
I fell off.

300
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:51,619
Shit.

301
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:52,619
This momentum.

302
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:53,619
It's all right.

303
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:54,619
I got six minutes.

304
00:23:54,619 --> 00:24:02,329
Careful.

305
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:03,329
Careful.

306
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:05,019
All right.

307
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,019
There's a game board here.

308
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:09,049
What's going on?

309
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:11,309
Hmm.

310
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:12,309
Ten centimeters.

311
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:13,309
Just get it bigger.

312
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:16,470
I know.

313
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,470
I know I'm going to do 20.

314
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,470
What do you think I'm doing?

315
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,470
I can get the candy.

316
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,380
Oh, I can get the tapes.

317
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,980
These things are huge.

318
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Get them.

319
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,980
All of them.

320
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Every single birthday tape.

321
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
Get it.

322
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Oh, my God.

323
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,829
I just ruined everything.

324
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:40,650
I'm going to go up here.

325
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,650
Pick up the entire breakfast.

326
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,650
House of cards?

327
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,650
No!

328
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,650
I fell off.

329
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,650
Shit.

330
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,819
Oh.

331
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,819
No.

332
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,960
That was about to be so satisfying.

333
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Get me up there.

334
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,200
Come on, man.

335
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Ah.

336
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
I can go to sleep tonight.

337
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Okay.

338
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Good.

339
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Reset.

340
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
What am I bumping into?

341
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Frogs?

342
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,619
Oh.

343
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:03,619
Oh.

344
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:04,920
Oh.

345
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,609
Oh.

346
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:07,609
Oh.

347
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:08,609
Oh.

348
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:15,480
Oh.

349
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,230
Oh.

350
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,230
Oh.

351
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,730
Oh.

352
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,359
Frogs?

353
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,359
Come on.

354
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,359
I can still pick shit up up here.

355
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,559
Oh.

356
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,559
Watch out.

357
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,559
I'm not going to get out.

358
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,819
I don't know why I think that's funny now.

359
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:37,779
Anything in the bathroom?

360
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:38,779
Oh, mousetraps.

361
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,019
I'm getting hit by the mousetraps.

362
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,140
Right here.

363
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Racer's got them.

364
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:53,480
All right.

365
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm good.

366
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,740
Anything else over here that I didn't get?

367
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:07,140
Can I get the whole dinner?

368
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
Yeah, I can.

369
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,140
18.4.

370
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
We got it.

371
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
That's fine.

372
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,630
Everything's fine.

373
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,630
I want to get up there.

374
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,630
How do I jump with this?

375
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,630
Can you jump with this?

376
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:22,029
What is left that I didn't get?

377
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:24,809
I can't go outside.

378
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:25,809
Oh, my God.

379
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:26,809
I can go outside.

380
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:27,809
Basket of apples.

381
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:33,210
Got it.

382
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,210
Just jump.

383
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,210
Oh, what a nice tatamari.

384
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,210
Substantially, it goes down smoothly.

385
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:42,900
But actually, we would love to have a much bigger, nicer tatamari.

386
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,539
We'll leave you to your work.

387
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,539
All right.

388
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:47,539
I've got to get up there.

389
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,539
Oh.

390
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,289
Oh.

391
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:51,289
Oh.

392
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:52,289
Oh.

393
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:53,910
Oh.

394
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,910
Oh.

395
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,910
But actually, we would love to have a much bigger, nicer tatamari.

396
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,910
We'll leave you to your work.

397
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,910
All right.

398
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,910
I've got to just...

399
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,910
I beat it.

400
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:13,779
I just have to get as many socks as I can.

401
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:14,779
Get the knives.

402
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:18,920
I know people are going to get really upset that I didn't get every sock.

403
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,460
And there's going to be a lot of opportunity where you can scream at me.

404
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
Pikachu sock.

405
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
Yeah, that's what they were.

406
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:36,269
Get the sock.

407
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:37,700
All right.

408
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Now, because I have an opportunity to, I'll get it.

409
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,029
It's back here, right?

410
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,420
Right there.

411
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
I got it.

412
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,009
I got it.

413
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:49,009
Everybody can relax.

414
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:50,009
I got the sock.

415
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:54,170
I'm not big enough to pick up a fence.

416
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:01,500
I love the PogChamp for picking up the sock.

417
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,599
Is that it?

418
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,599
Is that all it takes?

419
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,539
I just have to pick up a sock?

420
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:14,940
I'm not tall enough to get this.

421
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,440
Eventually, you can pick up...

422
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm tiny right now.

423
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
You guys think this is the whole game right here?

424
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,509
Just wait until I'm as big as the buildings.

425
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,740
Everybody clip that one.

426
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,259
Oh, I got the present.

427
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:43,220
Clip list rose.

428
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:54,000
Every time he says the word tall, small, or not big enough, make sure you get like five clips in it and then string them all together.

429
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So it's like small.

430
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Not tall enough.

431
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm small.

432
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm too small.

433
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm short.

434
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm too short for this.

435
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm too small for this.

436
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
God, not tall, short, inch.

437
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I just gave it to you.

438
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You don't even have to do the work.

439
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Nobody has to even do the work now.

440
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You just got it for free.

441
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,980
You don't even have to do the clip compilation.

442
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,619
There we go.

443
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:20,619
I can get the fence.

444
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:23,450
What?

445
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,450
I thought I was...

446
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,450
I couldn't just get the fence right there?

447
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,450
30 seconds.

448
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:35,880
Come on.

449
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Fast.

450
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,869
Fast.

451
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:41,869
I can't make it up here.

452
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:43,869
Into the lady's face.

453
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:48,539
Steal all of the shit that's on her desk.

454
00:29:48,539 --> 00:30:02,710
Time's up.

455
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,960
It was boring to watch this all the time.

456
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,339
Come on, man.

457
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:14,509
This game is really fun.

458
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:15,509
I love this game.

459
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:16,509
Let me have this.

460
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:24,859
King of the Cosmos is a chat.

461
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:25,859
34 centimeters.

462
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:26,859
It's pretty big.

463
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:27,859
We imagine it like a pretty star.

464
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:33,210
If it were ours, we'd make it much bigger.

465
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,660
Here.

466
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
This is our royal present.

467
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
What is it?

468
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,029
Guess what?

469
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:40,029
Guess what it is.

470
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:44,099
The thing that you collected the most of is stationary.

471
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:47,180
Earth is really full of things.

472
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,720
We will not release it into the sky.

473
00:30:51,720 --> 00:31:04,390
Oh, I forgot about these little...

474
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,390
Wait.

475
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,630
Everybody quiet.

476
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,630
We're about to leave.

477
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,940
Okay.

478
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,420
They're watching General Robo.

479
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:28,990
There's a story here, guys.

480
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,990
I didn't think it was an elaborate storyline.

481
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,150
I want to see what the present is.

482
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,269
Winter scarf.

483
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:39,269
Nice.

484
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:45,420
I'm not even saving it.

485
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:51,150
Let's just fucking go wild and not even save it.

486
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,150
Yeah, now I have a scarf.

487
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:57,359
Let's go back to Earth.

488
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,359
What about the secret mushroom?

489
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,900
Here's all the friends.

490
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Another cousin has arrived.

491
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,900
Here they are.

492
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,900
All right, who do I want to...

493
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
You can be...

494
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
This is a character.

495
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Who's your character?

496
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,779
So let's see.

497
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:14,859
Who do I want to be?

498
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:17,549
I fucked it up.

499
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,549
I couldn't even get the strength to even say anything afterwards.

500
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:21,549
I was trying to do...

501
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:23,549
I was going to say, Olimar!

502
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:30,079
But I missed?

503
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,980
Who do I be?

504
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,980
I kind of like the picnic table guy.

505
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:45,609
Or Longhead.

506
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:49,359
What about this guy?

507
00:32:49,359 --> 00:33:00,430
Oh, here, I was Marcy.

508
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,430
All right, fine.

509
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,490
I'm Marcy.

510
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,839
Come over here.

511
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:12,099
Why can't I select you?

512
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:15,109
What the hell?

513
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:19,680
Select.

514
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,859
Okay, got it.

515
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:25,170
No, no, select.

516
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:30,670
Can I not use usual control?

517
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,670
Okay, what the hell?

518
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,670
I can't play with Marcy?

519
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,170
Yeah, I'm pressing A. A's not doing anything.

520
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,859
Can I just...

521
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:42,250
This is for multiplayer only.

522
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,059
What?

523
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:50,079
I can't play as those characters?

524
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,079
Whatever.

525
00:33:51,079 --> 00:34:00,180
Everyone just get ready for the next meteor restart.

526
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,740
Boatar Day.

527
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,920
Have you ever been to Portugal?

528
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
We were there yesterday.

529
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,920
We hope you can visit during the day's rolling.

530
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
Like, that's possible.

531
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

532
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,289
Oh, yes.

533
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:15,289
A royal present for the Powered Working Prince is a present on here.

534
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,289
That's all I care about.

535
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:17,289
I don't even care if I fucking lose.

536
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,289
I don't care if I lose.

537
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,289
Give me the present.

538
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:20,289
That's what we were thinking.

539
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:22,289
But we sort of tossed it down to Earth.

540
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:27,719
We had an issue and just sort of pitched it away.

541
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,090
Must be around somewhere.

542
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,250
So roll it up while you're at it.

543
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,000
Will you guys leave?

544
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
No, not to leave.

545
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,329
I was going to say leave the king alone.

546
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:46,530
You guys leave.

547
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:51,650
No.

548
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:58,449
Like, I'm just going to do this by myself.

549
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:00,449
He'll be rolling around the town.

550
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:02,449
The Katovari should be, let's see, 50.

551
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:04,449
50 centimeters.

552
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:10,480
We can believe you can do it in nine minutes.

553
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Any longer than that and even the king and the cosmos can't wait for you.

554
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
We look forward to a nice Katamari.

555
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,300
Loser Prince.

556
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:27,639
This is my favorite song in the entire album.

557
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,639
Get out of the way.

558
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:33,059
Silverware first.

559
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:34,059
And a blue toothbrush.

560
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:42,699
It can even be about a blue toothbrush.

561
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:43,699
All right.

562
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:44,699
This got real though.

563
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:53,460
I have to be, I have to actually focus.

564
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Look at all the little animals.

565
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
What are they collecting?

566
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,460
What are these little mushroom popovers?

567
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
What are these things called?

568
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,460
The appetizer with the mushroom?

569
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,460
What are they called?

570
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
What are they called?

571
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,460
The stuffed mushroom?

572
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
What is it called?

573
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,460
A stuffed mushroom.

574
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:17,460
Let's roll.

575
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,079
Let's roll.

576
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:27,000
Let's roll, baby.

577
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I am not, look at the pizza wheel.

578
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh, I love this game.

579
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,780
I don't think I'm, I can't get these.

580
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:45,760
Collect bird.

581
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
I can't, I'm not big enough.

582
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
I can't get these yet.

583
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,730
Shit, I got to go back.

584
00:36:53,730 --> 00:37:00,699
I'm not big enough.

585
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:01,699
Damn it.

586
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:03,699
I did the wrong route.

587
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:05,010
No, it's okay.

588
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,010
I got plenty of time.

589
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,230
Get out of the way.

590
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:14,699
All these.

591
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,699
Watch this.

592
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:21,289
Ready?

593
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:27,150
Oh, this feels so good to pick them up.

594
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:35,199
Oh, we want some chocolate.

595
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,199
What?

596
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,630
Oh shit, there's a cat behind me.

597
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,630
When am I going to get chocolate?

598
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:50,789
What's wrong with me?

599
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:53,539
Is this, no, this is tape.

600
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:57,639
Am I big enough to get these?

601
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,639
The cylinders?

602
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,639
Yep.

603
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,639
Okay, chocolate.

604
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,639
And we need to find a present too.

605
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:06,340
Get up there.

606
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,340
I know you can.

607
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Really?

608
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,969
All right.

609
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:15,739
We have an edible arrangement.

610
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:21,300
Now I'm lopsided.

611
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,300
I need some bigger stuff otherwise this is not going to work.

612
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,300
Give me the spatulas.

613
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
And the clock.

614
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:34,239
Oh, it's 50.

615
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,309
50 milliliters, okay.

616
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:46,360
Get the clock.

617
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
Get the clock.

618
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,519
Take out food.

619
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,519
Take out food.

620
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,519
What?

621
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,269
I'm stuck.

622
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:57,269
I have to jump it.

623
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:58,269
Get up there.

624
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,269
Forget about the cat.

625
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:00,269
Just go.

626
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:01,269
Where's the clock?

627
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:02,960
Get clock.

628
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Get clock.

629
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,639
There it is.

630
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,639
I can't get the clock.

631
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:18,869
Watch out for the dung beetle.

632
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:19,869
It's stuck.

633
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:20,869
I cannot get the clock.

634
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:28,210
This dude, you're doing your own Katamari with shit.

635
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,210
Get out of the way.

636
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,539
I got it.

637
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,539
I got the clock.

638
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:33,539
Everybody can relax.

639
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,539
No, I didn't.

640
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,179
I can't get the clock.

641
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,190
Sorry.

642
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:45,659
You can get it.

643
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,659
Well, let me just make sure.

644
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:51,659
Let me come back when I'm a little able to get, when I'm able to pick that up.

645
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:52,659
Back down, okay?

646
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:56,429
I'm just stealing the muffins.

647
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,429
Ooh, too late.

648
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,670
What are you doing?

649
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:05,420
If anything, scamper is what we call it.

650
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,070
All right.

651
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,070
I'm now bigger.

652
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:22,170
I can't get the clock, everybody.

653
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,409
It's not going to happen.

654
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:25,409
It's glitched out underneath.

655
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:26,409
It's not going to happen.

656
00:40:26,409 --> 00:40:27,409
I only have four minutes.

657
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:35,320
I've got to stop listening to you guys about clocks.

658
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,440
I have to go up here.

659
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Where have you not gone?

660
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
All right, fish.

661
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,699
Here we go.

662
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:49,699
This will make me 50.

663
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:56,940
Oh, no.

664
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,940
This is not good.

665
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:05,730
This is not good.

666
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,730
Not good.

667
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,730
I got to get these trees.

668
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,420
I can't even pick these up.

669
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,409
I'm not big enough.

670
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:15,409
Soda?

671
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:16,409
Okay.

672
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:20,079
I don't even know the name of this song.

673
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,079
Do yourself a huge favor and just type in Katamari Damacy OST.

674
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:30,159
It looks like a whole damn thing.

675
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,159
Ooh.

676
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,590
Found the water jugs.

677
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:43,300
Three minutes, I can do it.

678
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Just get on top.

679
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Come on.

680
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,300
Look at all those utensils over here.

681
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,889
No.

682
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,889
Don't get stuck back here.

683
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:01,860
48.

684
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,909
I got it.

685
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:06,909
We want clock.

686
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:11,650
You guys don't really want the clock.

687
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:17,820
Plus, I don't even remember where the hell it even is.

688
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,820
Where's the clock?

689
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,019
Clock.

690
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:22,019
Clock.

691
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:24,340
Clock.

692
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
What a nice Katamari.

693
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,340
Kind of bratty.

694
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,340
Kind of shy.

695
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,710
See?

696
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,710
Flower clock.

697
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,710
I already got it.

698
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,710
Now that you've come this far, we would love to have a much bigger and nicer

699
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,710
one.

700
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,710
Let's go.

701
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,000
All right.

702
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Let's see if I can figure out where that clock was.

703
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I got two minutes to figure it out.

704
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,590
Clock or no stream?

705
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,590
Wasn't it up?

706
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,590
It was up here to the right, right?

707
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,929
It's over here.

708
00:42:58,929 --> 00:42:59,929
Okay.

709
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:00,929
Clock.

710
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:05,110
Line it up.

711
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,110
Oh, okay.

712
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,780
Everybody can calm down.

713
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,780
See?

714
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Now you can all hang out.

715
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Everything's fine.

716
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,630
I got the clock.

717
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,630
Clocked.

718
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,110
Yeah.

719
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,110
Oh, boy.

720
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:36,610
That was an ooh right there.

721
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,809
You have one minute left.

722
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:42,429
I can't go through there.

723
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:43,429
I'm too jacked.

724
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:44,429
I forget the broom.

725
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:48,739
No.

726
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:49,739
I get the dust fans.

727
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:50,739
This is the best part.

728
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:57,219
When you get big enough, you can just rush and roll over everything.

729
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:04,579
When I get to 70, can I jump that?

730
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:05,579
Come on.

731
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:06,579
Jump it.

732
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:13,070
Fire extinguishers.

733
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:20,280
Time for a fireworks display.

734
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
What?

735
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,570
What is he talking about?

736
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:26,739
Get all the birds.

737
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:29,739
I have 10 seconds to get the birds and the cow.

738
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:31,300
I got the cow.

739
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,300
Or dog.

740
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,719
Whatever it was.

741
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:38,619
71.

742
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:43,619
It comes and gets to the bunker.

743
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:55,300
I didn't get the present.

744
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,110
Royal Rainbow.

745
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,110
Take us back.

746
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:08,539
24 kill streak.

747
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:16,250
It's pretty big.

748
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,809
We imagine it'll make a pretty good start.

749
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:19,809
What even is this game?

750
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:21,809
I'm so glad that you don't know what this is.

751
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:25,809
It makes me very happy that you don't know because this is an old game from

752
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:30,809
PlayStation 2 that they just recently redid, reimagined and remastered.

753
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:33,809
I know it's a remake and remastered, but still.

754
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:34,809
It's on the Switch.

755
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:35,809
It's on Steam.

756
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:36,809
Is it on Steam?

757
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:37,809
Am I lying?

758
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:38,809
Is that a fucking incorrect statement?

759
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:44,460
It is.

760
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,460
Okay.

761
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,460
Yeah.

762
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,469
How much is this game?

763
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:49,469
This game's like 20, 30 bucks, right?

764
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:54,460
I picked up a lot of cooking for this.

765
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
30 bucks?

766
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,460
30 bucks.

767
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,409
That's not bad for a game like this.

768
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:07,170
There's a lot of content in this game.

769
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,170
A 30 dollar jug?

770
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:15,170
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

771
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:23,860
I really told you, didn't I?

772
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,860
Didn't I?

773
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:37,639
Am I saying this was made in Unity?

774
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,880
I can just bait it here.

775
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,789
That sounds like it could be real though.

776
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:54,599
Ported to Unity.

777
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:55,599
Okay.

778
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,599
So it's ported to Unity.

779
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,599
But Unity is one of those...

780
00:46:58,599 --> 00:46:59,599
It's one of those things that...

781
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,599
Oh hey, wow, interesting.

782
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:01,599
This was made in Unity.

783
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:18,380
My mic is fucked up. Wow, I got it. What? What? I can't hear you. What? I didn't get any

784
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:27,429
presents that round so, unfortunately. Pick a star 3. So we have some options here. We're gonna do

785
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:44,820
make cancer or make a star 4. Is there anything else? Peek the mic or riot? Why would I do that?

786
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:59,610
Yeah. So, 1, 2, listen, this is 3 so let's just stay, no, 1, make a star 2, make a star 3. So 4, 5.

787
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:12,750
Peek mic or riot? I'm not gonna peek my mic! What? Why do you want me to do that? Do it. Peek

788
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:25,539
the mic. What the fuck is wrong with you guys? What? The game is super loud compared to me.

789
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:39,059
That's better. When is the yes? Have you ever been to Spain? It's our other homeland. Peek it.

790
00:48:39,059 --> 00:49:36,699
I'll do it. Hold on. This is the only time you're gonna get me to do this. I can't do it. I

791
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:41,900
can't. I'm trying to capture it on my webcam. I was gonna break the webcam microphone but I

792
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,179
can't do that right now because I can't. I have my mic on the switch. I have to go

793
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:53,679
into my audio device settings. It's not like, hold on. Tell me if this changes anything. What

794
00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:00,940
is this doing? What is this doing? Is this the same? Is this the same? Do it. Oh, god damn it.

795
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:39,579
Just, hold on. No, it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. No. That's not gonna

796
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:43,260
happen because I can't, I have to like restock my computer for it to recognize the microphone

797
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:51,420
here. No, everybody relax. I'm not gonna peek my microphone. It's not recognizing the

798
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,219
other audio device which is the webcam mic. I'm not gonna peek this one. I'm not gonna

799
00:50:54,219 --> 00:51:07,940
break my fucking $6,700 of mic, okay? It's not gonna happen. Alright, let's go back to what

800
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:23,579
we're doing. Wallet, keys, rings, hopes, and dreams are lost at all. Roll it up while

801
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:35,289
you're at it. Break your stuff. I can't believe I just wasted like six straight minutes trying

802
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:44,800
to find a way to break the microphone that I have over here. Now, alright, if you stick

803
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,199
around for the whole stream, I will break this mic over here. I will peek this mic

804
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:52,039
until it doesn't work. Not this one, the webcam one. No, no, don't do that.

805
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:59,050
Okay, Stakatomari should be one, around one meter. We can believe in you, it's ten minutes,

806
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:05,059
one meter. But any longer than that of the king of all cosmos, I can't. We look forward

807
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:18,199
to a nice Katomari bite-sized prince. Let's go. There's another great song, too. This

808
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:24,590
whole soundtrack. What do the kids say? What do the kids say now, right? Light it

809
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:31,590
up, right? This contract is light it up. It's that good. It's like, it causes a fire,

810
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:40,260
right? Man, this soundtrack is so good. It's causing a fire in here. Who lit that fire,

811
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:54,329
right? No, this is not satisfying to me. I need to, I need this to be satisfying

812
00:52:54,329 --> 00:53:02,420
to me. Okay, that was that. That was satisfying to me. I can't leave here until I get

813
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:09,409
all the erasers. I don't think I'm gonna be, I don't think I'm gonna be able to

814
00:53:09,409 --> 00:53:16,440
get it, though. I have to go across. Oh, no! There's too much momentum, I had to do

815
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:32,679
it. Get out of the way, mouse. There's a bear with a sweater on it. Sing it with

816
00:53:32,679 --> 00:54:03,769
me now. I'm up here. Get the cones. Not big enough. Fuck. Roll it. I know you

817
00:54:03,769 --> 00:54:07,090
can do it. I know you can. I've seen you do it before. Come on, you're wasting

818
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:13,699
time. You're wasting time. Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. Why are you

819
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:19,579
wasting time? Come in here. There we go. Get all the erasers. You can't marry as

820
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:37,000
big as 24 lipsticks. Get it bigger already. Just get it bigger. Forehead. Okay.

821
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:49,119
Is that all the erasers? I think that's all the erasers. You see? No, just a bit more.

822
00:54:49,119 --> 00:55:02,449
Oh, erasers. Sing it with me now. I'm not even singing it. Why do I keep saying sing it with me now?

823
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:20,420
Oh, sing it with me now! Okay, can I break through the window? I'll be

824
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:31,440
eventually big enough to go through here. I'm missing, but I didn't get. Get the whole line of rats.

825
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:48,260
What am I missing here? The pencils? Orange peels? There we go. Nice roll-up. So

826
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:58,940
eristic from it. We are dazzled. Let's just roll it up before it runs off.

827
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:04,260
Why do you want me to roll up the animal? Right through, straight through. Here we go.

828
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:11,829
Get them all. Get all the cigarette packs. Don't smoke, but just pick them up if they're on the

829
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:19,130
ground. Don't pick cigarettes up if they're on the ground. Throw them in the trash when you do

830
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:35,650
that. 20 centimeters. Not a long, long way to go, but it really does exponentially. Light bulb?

831
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:44,110
Is this a sentient light bulb? What? If you can't make the Kazamari bigger, you can't get to the

832
00:56:44,150 --> 00:57:09,619
next stage. I'm working on it. It's not my fault this house is so fucked up. Little birds. I'll be back for those bears.

833
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:34,650
Really? Watermelon? That's not gonna make me grow? Just a baby. Just a very strong baby. Putting

834
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:42,099
the square peg into the circle hole. And he does it. That's a strong baby. That was

835
00:57:42,780 --> 00:58:05,409
Santa hat. At least I'm big enough to get these. This whole area, I think I can get. I'm losing so much

836
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:17,429
because I keep running into things I'm not supposed to be. The whole fridge worth of stuff. Here we go.

837
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:24,119
This is where, now we exponentially get marked. All the tuna cans. Mustard. Ketchup. Relish.

838
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:41,739
Bananas. Toast. Cheeseburger. Can I get it? I just want the milk. All right. It's back to

839
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:54,909
come out here. Let's see. Steal all their toys. How can I not get those? Santa hat? Santa? Where?

840
00:58:54,909 --> 00:59:06,510
Did I miss the Santa hat? Here's the worst part about this game being that somebody's watching and you

841
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:24,710
play this. There are items that I just miss and you're like, oh! Get it! Oh! Bathtub. Uh oh.

842
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:32,789
Oh no. No, no, no. Get me out of here. Because I'm losing a centimeter a second. Get me out of the

843
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:43,980
corner. Out of the corner. Jump. Oh shit. No, that was pizza pizza I think. I want to keep

844
00:59:43,980 --> 01:00:02,099
that. No, that's my dog bone. Oh! Oh thank god. I need to be a meter. Under the sink. I can. I

845
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:08,860
can get all of both of them. Just be careful. Wedged in under the sink. Don't hit the gas line.

846
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:22,219
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it, am I?

847
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:38,769
Fuck. There we go. Hold on. It's possible now. Only 50 still. I got half way to go.

848
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:52,480
Exponential. Come on. This is where you exponentially grow. Do it. Come on. Get in here.

849
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:11,329
No, no, no. The bathtub. The bathtub ruined the whole thing. Try to get up there. 60. Almost 60.

850
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:25,500
Come on. Grow another. 67. Oh, I gotta get to 100. When's the next big growth period here?

851
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:45,380
When do I get my new growth spurt? Is it TV? 75. One minute left. Back outside. 50 seconds.

852
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:58,849
Go! Get everything. Just dash everywhere. Pick up the cat. Pick up the shopping cart.

853
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:18,179
I can't. Fuck the cat. Fuck that cat. Come on! I get it. What a nice cat to borrow.

854
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,239
Tough get with a soft feel. Now that you've come this far, we'd like to have it a little

855
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:39,039
bigger. Okay, let's see how I can get it. I can't. I don't even know where I am.

856
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:52,530
I can't go back in the house. Oh, I'm in the house! Oh! I made it to the house. Damn it.

857
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:01,170
I can't believe it. I got in the house and I would have just sucked up everything.

858
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:13,440
It's a coarse goal, but it's not very exciting. We want a bigger one next time.

859
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,920
The thing you can collect at the most is play time. I don't even know what that even

860
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:27,900
means. Play time? Earth really is full of them. Time to release it into the sky.

861
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:35,309
What's this one called? Toys is the name of the star.

862
01:03:48,750 --> 01:04:24,449
To be, why does it say to be continued every time? To be continued. Say the game? No,

863
01:04:24,449 --> 01:04:30,159
don't think so. That's not even funny. Like, it's not funny. Because if for some reason

864
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:35,440
the game crashes or the console crashes or something, that's not even funny.

865
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,460
Oh, it's funny. We have to restart the whole game. Isn't that funny?

866
01:04:40,099 --> 01:04:51,039
Like, no, that's not funny. That would be a waste of time. Santa? Wait, Santa hat?

867
01:04:51,039 --> 01:05:09,309
I didn't get any presents. Oh, this is annoying. I had one present. All right, back to Earth.

868
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:17,090
Santa hat. All right, we've opened up more things. Here is,

869
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:24,269
uh, star five. We have to make constellations here. Okay, let's go.

870
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:35,039
They can't. What is it? Something's not quite there. Oh, yes, we get it. It just doesn't look

871
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:40,820
delicious. The sky does not seem yummy at all. Everyone is still hungry, yes? Can't you see that,

872
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:46,900
silly? Speaking of delicious, we must say, most certainly, we say crab. Most certainly crab.

873
01:05:51,170 --> 01:06:00,539
What a delightfully weird fucking dude. It's just what? I can't even read that.

874
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:13,889
What the fuck? I didn't even do it. Looks yummy. But no, no, not yet. Patience is a virtue. Focus,

875
01:06:13,889 --> 01:06:22,030
we must focus. To make the yummiest... Okay, we need crabs. All you have to do is roll up as

876
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:28,690
many crabs as you can find. Let's see. You have seven minutes to roll up as many crabs as

877
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:38,510
possible. We look forward to a mouth-watering catamari, callow prince. Go. Crabs. Oh! Oh,

878
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:47,059
I can't. I hate them. Why is a crab on the spider web? Why is a crab hanging from a spider

879
01:06:47,059 --> 01:06:57,630
web? What the fuck? Doesn't make any sense. I wish it was like that. I would love if spiders

880
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:01,789
weren't spiders. They were just crabs. I would love them. They would be so fun.

881
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:18,929
Crabs are spiders with armor. No, crabs are fun and funny and spiders are evil. I know this because

882
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:23,650
they're holding the toothbrushes. That's so... I love this. You know how I know this? Because

883
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:29,650
every television show and movie I've ever seen in my whole life, spider was evil and goes like

884
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:46,590
and every crab is a funny character that likes money or the dances and shit. That's all I've

885
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:54,269
ever been told. So of course I'm going to be scared of spiders and not crabs because of that

886
01:07:54,269 --> 01:08:05,840
stupid monster noise that I just made. Oh! Me money! Me money, SpongeBob! That's not like...

887
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:40,350
Why would I be scared of that? There's never been one spider in the history of media

888
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:46,430
that wasn't evil and had foam coming out of their mouth. I think it was like Charlotte's

889
01:08:46,430 --> 01:09:10,020
Web. That's the only one. Crabs foam at the mouth? Oh, they don't. Spider-Man? But Spider-Man is a

890
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:17,119
man that was bit by a spider. That's not the same thing. And the spider that bit him was

891
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:22,399
terrifying because for some reason he got superpowers by being bit by a black widow

892
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:29,869
radioactive fucking spider. That's scary. Oh yeah, but be careful. There's the

893
01:09:29,869 --> 01:09:34,189
black widow that'll bite you with radioactive poison in its fangs. Oh, but like it's Spider-Man.

894
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:42,850
The spider that bit Spider-Man, it was too small for you to hear it, but right before it bit him

895
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:55,760
it definitely went like... just didn't pick up on the microphone. I need more crab. I can't get

896
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:15,649
the funny crab with shoes on. The shrimp looks good too. I hate this shrimp. I have to get

897
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:28,750
the super crab. Crabs literally foam at the mouth to breathe. Yeah, but I see that as like

898
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:43,789
flavored foam at the mouth, like Starburst, not like evil's venom foam. Am I not big enough to

899
01:10:43,789 --> 01:11:07,939
get you? You know what I mean. Laughing at his own joke? No, I'm laughing at the interpretation

900
01:11:07,939 --> 01:11:14,079
of the thing that I said, which on second revelation it sounds pretty fucking dumb.

901
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:31,899
The crabs? There's no more. I've ran out. The only crabs over here and I'm too big to

902
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:52,720
get in there. There's some up. How do I go up? Can I climb? Jump? I can't. I don't have a jump.

903
01:11:52,720 --> 01:12:01,060
There's nowhere else I can go. Can I get up there? No, I can't. I can like go like this,

904
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:09,739
but that doesn't do anything. There's an elevator? Where's there an elevator?

905
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:24,699
That's not an elevator. This is not an elevator. Those are two chess pieces. Oh,

906
01:12:24,699 --> 01:12:45,069
come on. Really? All right, I got 90. Can I make it up? I need 100. Come on. There's

907
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:57,149
one right there. Got him. 97. Come on. 98, 99. How did I not get the one in the corner?

908
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:26,930
I need 100. I need 100 or I'm going to turn off this ring. What? What the fuck? I got it.

909
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:36,100
I got it. I got 100. If you Starburst is reminding you of foaming at the mouth,

910
01:13:36,819 --> 01:13:40,340
then no. By the way, I'm just fucking pissed about Starburst. Can I tell you?

911
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:48,159
I bought and I realized why there was a there was a box of Starburst, like a big box

912
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:53,329
that was on sale. I was like, holy shit, I like Starburst. Starburst are awesome.

913
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:59,810
I bought the box. The thing was on sale and Starburst don't have a fucking expiration date on

914
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:08,319
them. Can Starburst even expire? They made it a plastic rubber and they did take a droplet

915
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:19,779
and drop a little bit of flavoring juice on them. You just chew out the flavoring and then

916
01:14:19,779 --> 01:14:23,060
you spit it out. You're not supposed to swallow Starburst guys. It stays in your stomach

917
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:32,340
for like eight years. You chew it up until it's like a pale transparent color and then you just

918
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:39,539
spit it out. You don't want to be ingesting that. Have you seen the ingredient list?

919
01:14:55,090 --> 01:15:04,960
Oh shit, I've been eating them wrong. That actually does look kind of delicious. No,

920
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,840
it doesn't. Yeah, every Starburst you've ever eaten. Oh, hold on. I'll tell you in a minute.

921
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:40,380
Teapot. I love how that's the one thing you got out of that entire sequence

922
01:15:40,939 --> 01:15:45,979
and how delightfully odd that whole thing was. The teapot is the thing. Whoa, I can't believe

923
01:15:45,979 --> 01:16:08,300
there was a teapot there. But just be careful when you eat Starburst guys because the stage

924
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,859
is done for 10 years. So let's say you have like 200 Starbursts over the course of like

925
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:17,779
four years or something. Eventually you're gonna, you know, 10 years from now you'll be

926
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:25,539
like in your late 50s and you're just you're gonna shit out a gigantic flavored size

927
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:49,149
like basketball. Crap, loud. What do we got? We unlocked a Star, let's do Starfire.

928
01:16:50,029 --> 01:17:03,899
Yeah, you're gonna shit out a giant rubber flavored basketball. What are you gonna do

929
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:15,069
with that? Ever been to the Netherlands? We stopped in the day before yesterday.

930
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:19,500
We hope you can visit during the day's rolling like that's possible. Oh yes,

931
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:30,609
I mean why does he keep saying like that's possible? There's another present down here.

932
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:43,380
I want to get another present. I'm gonna work my ass off for this present. Hey Jerma,

933
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:47,460
I just made the math. I have 150 hours of old streams to watch. So can you please stop

934
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:54,699
streaming for 150 days? I don't think I could do that. Sorry that you're gonna be forever

935
01:17:54,699 --> 01:18:07,439
catching up. Okay, today you'll be rolling around the town. The Katamari should be,

936
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:16,380
let's see, around 15, 1.5 meters. There's a point there. 13 minutes for 1.5. Any longer,

937
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:21,020
and you'll be very angry. There's a gift here too. Tell me, okay, if you see the gift,

938
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:32,739
tell me the location of it. Because my eyes aren't so good anymore. You know, I'm gonna

939
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:38,770
take this one slow because I want to be sure I don't crash into everything, pick up all the

940
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:52,430
eggs. Quail chick. Not big enough for that. Ha ha, it's there. I'll know when I look over

941
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:57,229
the chat and see 500 million people all writing the same thing with like fail fish.

942
01:18:57,949 --> 01:19:04,779
Because I would have passed it three or four times by then. Use your eyes, fail fish. Use

943
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:08,859
your eyes. Is he this bad on purpose? Like, once I start seeing that, is when I know

944
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:39,760
that I'm close. Pretending. I'm not big enough for the milk. I need to drink more of that to

945
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:46,720
get bigger. Well, I don't. But whatever, just clip it and fucking use it in your video or

946
01:19:46,720 --> 01:20:06,050
whatever the hell you're making. Get it! I need to get to 15. I think I grow a little more.

947
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:18,819
Super glue? It's not 15. What is it? I'm getting all the little teeny tiny stuff first.

948
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:37,470
It's always the hardest part. The trees. Parsley. Reminds me of Jetset Radio song.

949
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:48,300
Both with good soundtrack. This soundtrack is so good. I remember having this on a CD

950
01:20:49,340 --> 01:21:03,899
that I would play in my car. Oh, look at this. Perfect. And I remember specifically stopping

951
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:12,819
at red lights with the windows down and blasting the title theme with all the windows

952
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:36,609
down. I remember there was one time. Okay, so listen, hear me out on this. This is like

953
01:21:36,609 --> 01:21:42,289
really embarrassing, but whatever, who cares? It's not even though, but it is. So one time

954
01:21:42,289 --> 01:21:51,810
I was driving some co-workers at the time home and I had a CD that was a lot of video

955
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:55,810
game music on the CD. And you know when you turn your car off when you're listening to

956
01:21:55,810 --> 01:22:02,770
music and you're blasting something just like, Oh yeah, this is like my alone me time music.

957
01:22:03,729 --> 01:22:08,609
Well, that's what it was. It was like a bunch of video game shit on it. And

958
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:14,770
my co-workers at the time, when they weren't like into video games, they didn't really.

959
01:22:15,489 --> 01:22:21,409
This is also probably like, this is like 15 years ago. So anyways, I'm driving them home

960
01:22:22,289 --> 01:22:27,170
and as we get in the car and I turn the car on and we start, Oh, there's music in here.

961
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:35,250
Oh, wait a minute. And the battle sequence theme from Lost Odyssey is playing loud.

962
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:48,380
It was just like, what is this? And I had to cover my tracks. You know what I mean?

963
01:22:48,939 --> 01:22:54,619
Cause it's like a symphony orchestra is what's playing. And I remember just going,

964
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:58,539
Oh, I love classical music. I'm like, I listen to classical music sometimes when I drive.

965
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:09,069
I bet he was beat red. It probably was. That's even worse. I have to,

966
01:23:10,189 --> 01:23:19,949
I had to cover my tracks. Ah, yes. Mozart. Yeah. So I had to look like the guy driving around

967
01:23:19,949 --> 01:23:26,670
listening to fucking Mozart. And honestly, I'm, let me tell you something about classical

968
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:29,069
music. And now I'm going to, a lot of people are probably going to disagree with me here,

969
01:23:29,789 --> 01:23:36,510
but the only time I ever hear classical music ever is when you were at the dentist getting

970
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:51,010
surgery. So I don't want to be the guy listening to classical music. Like when you're getting

971
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:57,060
like your teeth pulled, the guys listening to classical music, I don't want to listen to that.

972
01:23:57,619 --> 01:24:01,939
And there's nothing wrong with classical music. It's really, you know, very expertly crafted.

973
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:11,659
It's amazing pieces and they work so well and there's so much wonderful, wonderful music.

974
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:23,300
That has come out of full orchestras and classical instruments. But I don't, I don't,

975
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:28,050
I'm not listening to it in my car, like hanging out with friends. Like, oh, what do you,

976
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:32,510
what do you got, man? What's on your, what's on your playlist? Oh, well, you know, I've got,

977
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:41,550
you know, Eminem, I guess, I think. And then like, it'd be like, dude, what the fuck is

978
01:24:41,550 --> 01:25:00,800
this? It's like, ah, nothing. There's a play, where's the present? No one has seen it yet.

979
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:16,770
But I love listening to classical music. I do. But for some reason, I don't know why this is,

980
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:20,930
but classical music really is just, you don't, you don't want people to know that you're

981
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:27,489
listening to it. I don't know why. If everyone can agree that classical music is so wonderful,

982
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:45,279
well, we're not allowed to play it in our cars. What is this? I love in the middle of

983
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:52,210
that. Is he this bad on purpose? So there's a way through here. I just get it. Okay.

984
01:25:52,930 --> 01:26:01,729
No, I love, I love classical music, but I also don't listen to like really any music.

985
01:26:03,789 --> 01:26:17,010
You guys all know that because you're wondering why everyone's like, what are you talking about?

986
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:22,050
Question mark. Because I'm a fucking idiot. Like I'm an imbecile. And for some reason,

987
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:26,770
when I have music on, it's the only thing I can do. I can't put music on in the

988
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:31,010
background. I can't, I can't have a conversation while music's playing. It's just like,

989
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:34,529
I can hear it. I just think though, okay, I'm here, the lyrics and talking and there's the

990
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:45,380
beat and I'm talking too, but I can't cause I have to hear, but what are you doing now?

991
01:26:47,489 --> 01:26:50,770
Yeah. But this is different because this has to be on here because this is the whole, this is

992
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:55,890
like 70. This is 0.70. No, this is seven. This is like 50% of the reason why you play

993
01:26:55,890 --> 01:27:00,579
the game. No, that's like 30% because this, this is not, you know what I'm saying? It's

994
01:27:00,579 --> 01:27:06,079
a fucking amazing sound. Okay. Case in point. I couldn't just talk to you there

995
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,300
because I heard like the construction music in the background.

996
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:35,569
Where's that entrance? Up here somewhere? I did actually go past it. This has to be 1.5 meters,

997
01:27:35,569 --> 01:27:46,029
right? I gotta be kind of on the ball here. Not pretending. Let me get home. Let me,

998
01:27:46,029 --> 01:28:00,449
let me get the Jenga thumb. I can't get that. Really? Fail, fail, fail. Yeah. I

999
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:09,300
don't listen to music. I'm such a fucking strange person, man. I listen to music alone

1000
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:16,020
in my office sitting here and I put on stuff like Pac-Man's theme from Smash Brothers.

1001
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:35,229
Like the cool one. And I listen to it like 17 times in a row. Is that weird? And then

1002
01:28:35,229 --> 01:28:41,779
you get to the one part of the, holy shit, I'm going fast. Oh, do it again. Do it again.

1003
01:28:41,779 --> 01:28:48,989
Have to do that again. So you pick like the one part in the song that you want to hear

1004
01:28:48,989 --> 01:28:55,180
over and over again. You get to that part of the song where it's like the big breakdown

1005
01:28:55,180 --> 01:29:01,949
and you listen to it like 87 times. And then you wonder silently to yourself,

1006
01:29:02,829 --> 01:29:08,590
what like the, the YouTube data algorithm on your profile looks like and where you've

1007
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:16,739
clicked on this same video, like 185 times. Get out of the way. I need to get a strike.

1008
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:36,880
All right, here we go. I can't see. Oh, close enough. I just got wrecked by a cat.

1009
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:46,220
You listen to music on YouTube. See? I told you. I knew there was something wrong with it.

1010
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:55,100
I knew there was something wrong with what I was doing. I don't have very much time left.

1011
01:29:55,100 --> 01:30:12,060
I got to focus here. The radishes, what you do with music. Who's on this bike?

1012
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:18,819
What you do with music is normal. Everybody does that. So are people just pretending they

1013
01:30:18,819 --> 01:30:25,260
don't do that? I don't know, because I know a lot of people that have Spotify open and they

1014
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:39,949
don't, I don't think they've heard the same song twice. Like, oh, I have a Spotify on the

1015
01:30:39,949 --> 01:30:46,539
discover mode. Yeah. I've probably listened to 14,000 songs in the last like five years.

1016
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:59,100
The same clip. Wait, I can pick up the water? No, those are rookie numbers. I'm going to lose

1017
01:30:59,899 --> 01:31:17,500
1.5. Come on, dogs. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Get out. Out, out, out, out, out.

1018
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:32,220
Oh, fuck. Into the supermarket. Oh no, I'm going to lose. Why are there so many people

1019
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:55,699
in the way? Get out of the fucking way. No. We were talking about fucking starbursts

1020
01:31:55,699 --> 01:32:10,000
and shitting out basketballs. I was going to pay attention. Everything you do is kind of lame.

1021
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,239
Nobody wears sharp horns like that anymore. And why is your head so wide? For the record,

1022
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:19,279
there's nothing here. Well, you get your stardust today. I'll do a better job next time.

1023
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:37,279
Do it again. Was I really loud right there? I don't want to be like the loud guy.

1024
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:49,859
Have you been to the Netherlands? Yeah, it's the same one. I'll get it this time. Fast.

1025
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:55,100
You waste the time going back up the hill for the bowling joke. You

1026
01:32:55,500 --> 01:33:07,899
dare. But we were talking about how crabs aren't spiders. I had to pay attention to that. That

1027
01:33:07,899 --> 01:33:18,859
was more important. All right, 1.5. Let's do it. In the very beginning, I was like,

1028
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:32,340
I'm going to take my time. Be very careful. No, just go. Are lobsters spiders? Well, no,

1029
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:39,039
because lobsters look like, really, they just look like lobsters. There's no other

1030
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:48,449
animal or crustacean that even looked remotely similar. When I look at crab, I think, okay,

1031
01:33:48,449 --> 01:33:53,329
that's a spider. When I see lobster, I say that's a lobster. That's it. There's nothing

1032
01:33:53,329 --> 01:34:03,119
you can even compare a lobster to. A shrimp? Yeah. Yeah, that's just like a big shrimp.

1033
01:34:16,779 --> 01:34:31,550
Nothing compares to you. Am I accidentally, purposely avoiding all the shit I need to pick

1034
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:40,350
up right now? Oh yeah, there's a scorpion in the house today. That was different. I've never

1035
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:48,189
seen one before. I have not seen a scorpion in real life ever until two hours ago, like an hour

1036
01:34:48,189 --> 01:35:00,560
ago. Finally, a game that punishes stalling. Well, that's why we're not stalling anymore.

1037
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:13,539
Did I freak out? No, because it was already dead. I talked to Talix about it. I was like,

1038
01:35:13,539 --> 01:35:23,819
did you kill a scorpion down here? No. Oh, it was really weird. And we don't think that

1039
01:35:23,819 --> 01:35:28,060
the dogs had anything to do with it. Maybe one of the dogs went after it and got it.

1040
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:34,880
You got to be careful there, though, because a dog can get actually very seriously injured

1041
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:47,649
from a scorpion or a large insect. So we have a little talk about what we need to do.

1042
01:35:48,449 --> 01:35:53,229
And we need to start this kind of thing. It's weird. It's December. A scorpion in December.

1043
01:35:55,260 --> 01:36:03,260
I thought all bugs go to hell. Well, I mean, all bugs go to hell, but they disappear

1044
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:22,210
for the winter months. That's why it was inside. All bugs go to Valhalla. No, are you kidding me?

1045
01:36:23,229 --> 01:36:27,229
It's like if a scorpion was in, like crawled in front of Odin, no, he's so strong.

1046
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:33,920
That's me, Odin. I'm the most powerful. Oh, it's a scorpion. Get it out of here. Thor.

1047
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:43,869
Thor, help me, Thor. And Thor comes in. What is it, father? Ew, ew. And then Thor is like,

1048
01:36:43,869 --> 01:36:48,189
don't worry, I will use my hammer. And oh, it grows.

1049
01:36:50,189 --> 01:36:52,909
And then somebody finally, like, throws a grom at it and kills it.

1050
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,800
Could you miss any more items? I was supposed to be paying attention. All right, no more fucking

1051
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:33,659
around. Could you miss any more items? You know, you're right. They do have a coin.

1052
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:39,920
I can't just leave it up to the last 10 seconds. You know what I mean? I got to

1053
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:48,850
get big now. You know, turn on the infomercial. I used to look like you.

1054
01:37:50,109 --> 01:37:59,819
Scrawny, small. And then I started drinking Jack's juice. Oh, by the way,

1055
01:37:59,819 --> 01:38:13,010
all this is is just maltodextrin. A shitload of it. And some chocolate powder.

1056
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:31,010
I can't get up there. Fuck. He's dodging items. I need to just shut up and play, man.

1057
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:38,159
Did my brain subconsciously think this was an avoid the object game?

1058
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:44,210
I'm sitting here talking, and I'm, oh, watch out, I don't want to run into anything.

1059
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:55,060
All right, I got bigger. All right, eight minutes. I got enough time.

1060
01:38:55,060 --> 01:39:08,369
Pick up, I want to pick up this shit on your car, man. Get all the envelopes,

1061
01:39:08,369 --> 01:39:15,970
get the Nintendo. I can't pick up the Nintendo? All right, I need to go,

1062
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:26,539
I need to change locations. Only 35 centimeters. All right, this is where we pick up

1063
01:39:26,539 --> 01:39:45,550
the whole world. I'm just gonna get to 50, pick up all the soda bottles.

1064
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:53,869
There's a lot more soda bottles over here. Good. I could go for one of those tees.

1065
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:59,010
Yeah, playing Katamari, you really do need to have snacks available.

1066
01:39:59,569 --> 01:40:05,229
And now it wants me to go through here. There's a way through there.

1067
01:40:05,789 --> 01:40:08,930
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna wrap around. I'm gonna get a little bit bigger first.

1068
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:16,880
Get all the crabs. At least most of them. Now it's hiding.

1069
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,880
Don't even worry about it. Nintendo. Can I pick up the Nintendo?

1070
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:27,869
Now I can. Okay. Katamari is about hitting the wall and stalling.

1071
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:34,399
How dare you say that. What? I'm not big enough to go through there?

1072
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:48,850
Stop. Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh. Not when I'm playing Katamari Damacy.

1073
01:40:49,409 --> 01:41:12,289
Strike. Doing way better than I did last time. So, wait. I can't pick up the full

1074
01:41:12,289 --> 01:41:16,020
watermelons? I can only pick up half watermelons. What kind of video game

1075
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:25,279
do you think you are? This is where I'm gonna have a lot of time to exponentially take out

1076
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:50,939
everything in here. Solar panels? Please move. Can I pick these up yet?

1077
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:55,090
I feel like I did the same stupid shit last time. I definitely did.

1078
01:42:03,949 --> 01:42:08,029
This is the guy that runs into walls and stalls playing Katamari.

1079
01:42:08,029 --> 01:42:20,880
The melons germo. I couldn't get them. I could get them now.

1080
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:33,279
I couldn't get them. I couldn't do it. All right. Let's take a trip over here.

1081
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:36,239
Try to pick up as many radishes as I can because they're pretty large.

1082
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,729
I'm gonna go up here again. Back to the street.

1083
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:45,579
Anything else that I missed over here? There's a guy lying down.

1084
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:50,859
Okay. Didn't do anything I thought that was gonna do.

1085
01:42:51,180 --> 01:43:06,060
Wait...I'm almost there. 150. Did I get the sign? Did I have the barber?

1086
01:43:06,619 --> 01:43:14,750
Can't get the sign. I'm going back up because there's a

1087
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:17,630
lot of shit that I can get over here now that I couldn't previously.

1088
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:37,550
He's too fat. I mean, am I? I'm not really though.

1089
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:41,090
That's good. I want to be huge down these halls so I can just

1090
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:50,109
accidentally pick up everything. Yeah, take down this whole wall.

1091
01:43:50,670 --> 01:44:00,989
I got the phone. This may have actually been a terrible idea, you're right.

1092
01:44:00,989 --> 01:44:08,159
I gotta stay on the road. This was a very bad idea.

1093
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:24,220
This was a very bad idea. Oh no, this was a terrible fucking idea.

1094
01:44:24,939 --> 01:44:29,390
Get back down here. Down. Back down. Back down. Forget about everything here. Go.

1095
01:44:36,529 --> 01:44:54,399
Oh shit. Shit. What have I done? Get the cat. What the fuck have I done?

1096
01:45:00,609 --> 01:45:04,689
Oh, I'm so mad. What was I fucking talking? I said Thor's name and it's angering me.

1097
01:45:05,409 --> 01:45:38,609
I'm actually fucked here. I think I can fit. I can't jump. I can't fit through this at...

1098
01:45:38,689 --> 01:45:42,529
Oh, I'm so mad at myself. You have no idea. I'm fucking furious with myself.

1099
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:56,859
I am furious with myself because I went back up here and now I can't go back down. I am

1100
01:45:56,859 --> 01:46:14,220
absolutely livid. Why did I come back up here? Why? What was the purpose of coming up here?

1101
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:57,300
Why can I... Why could I even... Okay, here's what I don't understand. Why could I fit back

1102
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:17,470
through there the first time? And then when I lost like 25 centimeters, I couldn't go back down.

1103
01:47:18,109 --> 01:47:22,699
Really? Like I told... I don't even pay attention this time. Let's talk about Thor like throwing

1104
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:49,420
darts at a scorpion. It's a pretty try-hard time. It is. I'm not gonna lose this one.

1105
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:54,210
We want some grace back in the sky, but the swans don't seem to have hatched yet.

1106
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:59,539
Pick up eggs. Don't... Nobody talk about any other topics besides Katamari.

1107
01:47:59,539 --> 01:48:08,899
Get as many as you can and make as... Okay, gotta pick up as many eggs as I can.

1108
01:48:11,229 --> 01:48:17,279
Seven minutes. I'm not talking about anything else. Look at Katamari eggs. Where's... Where

1109
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:23,920
do I go from here? To the left. Pick up more of these eggs. Cool. All right. Eggs.

1110
01:48:27,149 --> 01:48:35,760
Make sure I get them all. Am I big enough? Yes, I am. I can get these ones. Focus on them.

1111
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:40,319
Watch out. You don't... Well, it's going to happen every time I do this.

1112
01:48:42,609 --> 01:49:06,369
I'm trying to get seven. I ate like fucking 30 eggs. Okay, I got four. Four. Wait,

1113
01:49:06,369 --> 01:49:27,279
they can't be broken. Oh shit. Why does that one not count? They have to be swans.

1114
01:49:34,529 --> 01:49:38,460
You know what they say? You don't make eggs without what? Yeah, this is a beautiful song.

1115
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:49,680
Don't fall off. Get them off. Cool. How many swans do I need? Just as many as I can get.

1116
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:54,770
There's a lot up here.

1117
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:07,409
Some of them are not going to be swans. I'm going to try to get 50 swans.

1118
01:50:08,449 --> 01:50:09,649
That's a number that's way too high.

1119
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:20,989
There's another one. Just a regular egg.

1120
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:31,630
They're hitting eggs with a golf club? What a sick fuck.

1121
01:50:34,739 --> 01:50:35,939
Just sit here for a second. Get them all.

1122
01:50:48,029 --> 01:50:52,829
What is a swan anyway? No, don't get me talking. Do not get me to talk.

1123
01:50:52,989 --> 01:51:05,279
I can't be trusted when I start speaking. It's a silent stream. I'm going to go underneath

1124
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:18,659
because I'm still small enough to get these. If I got stuck under there, I would have just

1125
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:24,699
swallowed the switch. I would have been the first person to ever eat a switch.

1126
01:51:25,739 --> 01:51:51,869
Oh, you momentum. Come on. You can't get angry. Yes, you can. Oh yes, you can. I was

1127
01:51:52,829 --> 01:51:56,180
going to say with the soundtrack playing in the background.

1128
01:52:17,710 --> 01:52:24,779
All right. We suspect. All right, I got 24. What do I want? 50? I'm probably only going to get

1129
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:36,479
25. Oh, I haven't got up here. Can I get up there? All right. Duckling, duckling, swan. 25.

1130
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:51,470
Can I make it up this way? Say something. No, not yet. This one is very specific.

1131
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:06,880
I got to get to 30. You know what I'm saying? I got to get to 30. I mean, I don't understand.

1132
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:31,630
30. 29. 30. I'm going to climb up on a shoe to get up here. Get up there, dude. What?

1133
01:53:31,630 --> 01:53:38,140
What are you doing? What are you doing? It can't be a weird number like 31.

1134
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:45,409
It's got to be like 45 or something, right?

1135
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:49,090
How many characters were in the last Smash Brothers game?

1136
01:53:50,720 --> 01:54:06,319
42. 43. That's how much we need. I can't live with this if it's 36.

1137
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:26,270
Here we go. I'll get some here. You have one minute left. 38. 39. No, don't do 39.

1138
01:54:26,829 --> 01:54:29,069
It's going to be 41. I'm going to stop playing after I get to 40.

1139
01:54:31,869 --> 01:54:38,750
45. 45. Get it. 50. I can get 50. Don't sell yourself

1140
01:54:39,979 --> 01:55:20,939
under what you would assume. No, not 46. Oh, 46. Very graceful and a bit disturbing.

1141
01:55:21,659 --> 01:55:33,979
Tweet, tweet, tweet. Noisy things will take the graceful rainbow back. Restart. 46 is not bad.

1142
01:55:33,979 --> 01:55:52,289
That's 65 percent. That's a D. All you have to do is pass. 46 smalls. Commonplace grace.

1143
01:55:52,289 --> 01:55:58,609
Skin deep grace. Fake grace. Grace and light. It'll be a counterfeit constellation.

1144
01:55:58,609 --> 01:56:03,489
It will be a pale imitation of a swan in the sky. All righty, let's just release it into the

1145
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:13,789
sky. He's mad at me for getting a D on my report card. You need a 70 to pass. Since when?

1146
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:37,600
What are you guys on about? Since when do you need a 70? A 70 is a C minus.

1147
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:54,739
Did they change the way the grading is done? What do you mean yes? A 60 is a D minus.

1148
01:56:56,539 --> 01:57:04,189
70 is now a D minus. So what's 80? That doesn't make any sense. 70 is a D minus. 80 is a C

1149
01:57:04,189 --> 01:57:12,460
minus. 90 is a B minus. And 100 is what? An A minus? How do you get an A plus? 80 is a B

1150
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:30,300
minus. What are you guys talking about? Anything below 80 is an F. D is a fair. I'm

1151
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:45,500
doing this wrong. It's not 10% per letter. I'm being fucked with here. 60 to 69 is a D.

1152
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:53,140
60 is a D minus. 69 is a D plus. 70 is a C minus. 79 is a C plus. What am I? Are people

1153
01:57:53,140 --> 01:58:10,449
just making me feel? Talk about anything besides school. All right, I'm going to do

1154
01:58:10,449 --> 01:58:26,699
this one now. 70 is a B. No. No, it's not. Whatever. It's not a- whatever. I- I used- I

1155
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:30,460
was- I was a teacher. I was a substitute teacher, guys. I know how to grade papers.

1156
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:52,640
I didn't do any grading, by the way. I talked with a fake English accent and would draw

1157
01:58:52,640 --> 01:59:03,409
pictures on the board and stuff. Why am I trying to pay attention? What's with this

1158
01:59:03,409 --> 01:59:23,180
leveling causing my brain to turn off? Lore, you've no- oh yeah, I've talked about that

1159
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:33,279
many times before. I'm staying over with the fruits. This is a different route this time.

1160
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:51,489
This is the fruit route. Missed gift. No, I didn't. No, I didn't. You can't prove that.

1161
01:59:55,470 --> 02:00:04,289
Golden fruit split. What a joy of a video game. Can I just- let's be real.

1162
02:00:05,329 --> 02:00:16,560
You know what I mean? Does anybody else think that? I'm so glad that they remade this.

1163
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:40,939
It deserved it. First crash of the evening of this level, I mean. First crash of the evening.

1164
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:50,050
That's not true at all. Watch out for the goats. I know you're gonna say that's a dog.

1165
02:00:50,050 --> 02:01:09,680
That is- those are goats. That is a goat face. Much better than last time. Nobody brought up

1166
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:16,699
any comic book characters. I didn't talk about, like, orchestras. There's no reference

1167
02:01:16,699 --> 02:01:31,420
to shitting. And look at how good I'm doing. Let me take a look. Anything else over here

1168
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:45,710
I can do? Is this a sponsored stream? Is that even happening? Why would they sponsor people to

1169
02:01:45,710 --> 02:02:07,279
play this? Why else would I play this? No, don't start. Don't start it. You're in the

1170
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:18,210
middle of doing very well. See? I controlled myself. No, if you're new to the- if you're

1171
02:02:18,210 --> 02:02:25,579
new to the channel here on Twitch, I do not do sponsored content on the channel. That is a-

1172
02:02:25,579 --> 02:02:46,020
that is a guarantee. We're all new. That's not to say I never will for any reason, but I probably

1173
02:02:46,020 --> 02:03:05,680
won't. I cannot see a scenario where I ever would. Is that a money back guarantee? Covering

1174
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:11,680
his tracks again? Okay, hold on. When was the last sponsored thing you saw on this stream?

1175
02:03:13,039 --> 02:03:19,170
Time's up, because the answer is it's never happened. That's never happened. It's been

1176
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:27,460
like three years. Sponsored by JetBlue. No, I just said that JetBlue is a fantastic fucking

1177
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:32,560
airplane company that's quality and I've never had a problem with them. That's not me- that's

1178
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:36,479
not a sponsorship. That's me talking about a service that I've purchased that I liked.

1179
02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:47,739
Brain fluid. Yeah, but they didn't even pay me. The guy that- the guy that made the company

1180
02:03:47,739 --> 02:03:57,069
fucking- I got like a bunch of weird emails. They were all broken up and it almost like

1181
02:03:57,069 --> 02:04:02,539
there's a lot of typos and shit. He said that the check- it was- it was for 40 grand.

1182
02:04:02,539 --> 02:04:08,220
That's why I did it. And he said it was- it'd be- I would get it within two business days of doing

1183
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:16,689
the sponsorship. And I- he- I got- it was a little weird because I had to send money to him

1184
02:04:16,689 --> 02:04:22,130
first to like prove that my bank account was be- could be linked to his. So I- I mean,

1185
02:04:22,130 --> 02:04:38,189
I'm still kind of waiting. I sent to get it to work. All right, we've got eight minutes.

1186
02:04:38,189 --> 02:04:44,800
Yeah, I mean, it was two business days and that was, um, was it like a year ago now? So,

1187
02:04:45,439 --> 02:04:50,220
I mean, maybe I got like stuck or lost in the mail or something. And it's weird because every

1188
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:55,579
time I send a message to that email address, I get back the the mailer like daemon thing,

1189
02:04:55,579 --> 02:04:59,659
whatever it is, the Matt Damon mailer that says the address doesn't exist or something,

1190
02:04:59,659 --> 02:05:03,020
which is weird. I'm trying to get him to send me his new email. I'm sure he will.

1191
02:05:03,979 --> 02:05:18,859
Nintendo, give me it. Oh no, he's getting distracted again.

1192
02:05:25,489 --> 02:05:47,729
Get the cap. Car. All right, this time when I go down, I'm not going back up. Not going down

1193
02:05:47,729 --> 02:05:51,920
there yet. Let me get a couple more things in here because this place I didn't go right over

1194
02:05:51,920 --> 02:06:06,289
here. Okay, now I'm going down. Watch out for the people that are blocking my path. That's

1195
02:06:06,289 --> 02:06:09,329
the only reason why they're up here is just to walk back and forth and be annoying.

1196
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:27,949
See? All right, no one's. I've got over five minutes to do this. More than halfway there.

1197
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:41,310
Make sure I don't miss anything. Get the pineapple. Jerma, get the pineapple. Jerma,

1198
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:45,409
the pineapple. The pineapple. Get the pineapple, Jerma. Jerma, get the pineapple.

1199
02:06:46,340 --> 02:07:11,949
Jerma, get the pineapple. Okay. Jesus Christ. Jesus. Choose. All right. Almost at one meter

1200
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:23,340
and then it gets easier. What are you? Why do the people have to be just in a fucking way?

1201
02:07:29,409 --> 02:07:38,449
Get away from me. I'm going to get all the radishes and all the fruits here.

1202
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:42,369
It's just free and it's a lot of space. It gets a lot of space.

1203
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:59,359
Takes up a lot of space on the actual Katamari. It's very heavy. That's why it takes a while

1204
02:07:59,359 --> 02:08:06,720
to roll it. It's a heavy piece of equipment. Okay. Now we're going to cross this way.

1205
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:16,130
Pick up a couple of these baskets. Up and across. Here we go. I beat the level. I won.

1206
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:26,210
Now nobody can pull back this VOD and be like. That's what a lot of you guys do.

1207
02:08:26,210 --> 02:08:28,609
I get to a certain part of the game that I have trouble with and then you just sit there

1208
02:08:28,609 --> 02:08:49,090
and go. Get on stage. Take all this guy's stuff. This is a huge. Come on. 1.5. Almost there.

1209
02:08:49,810 --> 02:09:03,699
This is done. Now it begins. This is the guy that died to Pinwheel on stream. I did.

1210
02:09:03,699 --> 02:09:16,939
It was really bad. I lost like 30 times in a row. I think that evening I think I lost

1211
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:24,399
six or seven hundred subscribers to the channel because I died to Pinwheel on like

1212
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:29,199
the 20th or 30th attempt that I remember just like. Chat was. We got a huge argument.

1213
02:09:29,199 --> 02:09:34,960
It was like, dude, you are so fucking terrible. And I went off. Let me tell you something, chat.

1214
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:41,539
I was talking about like how Pinwheel is hard and like I think the word I used was like

1215
02:09:43,060 --> 02:09:46,819
dumb idiots or something like that. It was like a thousand subs that left overnight.

1216
02:09:47,460 --> 02:10:12,989
It was really bad for the channel. Can I get two? What is your cat? What is Duck Hunt

1217
02:10:12,989 --> 02:10:17,229
Dog doing up there? Yes, I'm going to make references to Spanish Brothers because I've been

1218
02:10:17,229 --> 02:10:23,500
playing it recently. Well, I can't move from here, so a good thing I beat it.

1219
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:49,409
Still not two meters. Give me the two. Come on. I'm going to grow a little bit higher.

1220
02:10:49,970 --> 02:10:56,050
And then, no, not another level. I got to be close to getting a little bigger.

1221
02:11:12,590 --> 02:11:31,380
You all laughed at me when I was small. And look at you now. What about this guy? Let's

1222
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:43,010
rip him off the pole. Now I know why Jerma likes this game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's

1223
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:49,840
really, really funny. That's very funny. That's going to be when Twitch finally does their awards,

1224
02:11:50,479 --> 02:11:54,720
right? You know, you see like the gamer awards. It's like the one. No, eventually,

1225
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:59,520
I'm going to predict this is the timestamp. And like the next year or two,

1226
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:04,479
Twitch is going to have its own award show for a bunch of different Twitch related awards.

1227
02:12:06,189 --> 02:12:09,470
It's going to be the Twitch Awards and there'll be a whole thing. It'll do to probably

1228
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:15,439
TwitchCon. It's going to happen. And when they do that, they're going to pull back.

1229
02:12:15,439 --> 02:12:20,899
They'll be like, best chat joke. And there'll be nominees on screen and you'll get to go.

1230
02:12:20,899 --> 02:12:26,800
You'll be sitting there next to the guy that said resident sleeper. Like he spammed it

1231
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:34,430
during a boring part of a video game. That one will probably be nominated.

1232
02:12:49,199 --> 02:12:59,199
I don't understand. Santa hat. Santa hat. Ice cube. I don't know. What is this?

1233
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:08,880
If it were ours, we'd make it much bigger. The thing that you collected the most of is

1234
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:19,819
vegetables. Oh, I got lots of vegetables. I don't have a better TV and I'm never going to have it.

1235
02:13:19,819 --> 02:13:25,619
I'm never going to download it. I have a bright white background and default emotes.

1236
02:13:41,739 --> 02:13:44,859
I saw him. I saw him outside. He was just standing there.

1237
02:13:55,699 --> 02:13:58,180
King of the cosmos should be in Smash Brothers. Shouldn't he?

1238
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:13,229
Too big. Oh, that was the Ridley excuse. And we got Ridley. So I don't buy, I don't buy that

1239
02:14:13,229 --> 02:14:43,390
one anymore. Make Corona Warialis. Any other ones we have so far? Make a star six. Let's do the

1240
02:14:43,390 --> 02:14:55,470
Corona. What is it? It still needs something. Is it our royal present? No, something more.

1241
02:14:55,470 --> 02:15:01,970
Oh yes. It's not gorgeous. The sky is not gorgeous at all. A starry sky and it still

1242
02:15:01,970 --> 02:15:08,899
manages to look shabby. It has gone. It has none of the beauteous maximal gorgeousness of our

1243
02:15:08,899 --> 02:15:27,069
crown. What do you mean year? What are you talking about? Can somebody describe what the Santa hat

1244
02:15:27,069 --> 02:15:34,659
emote is? Describe what it is. Oh, it's balding. Amazing, amazing. The earth looks amazing today.

1245
02:15:34,659 --> 02:15:42,340
What's this? Crowns everywhere. It's just a Santa hat. But what does it look like? Is it on

1246
02:15:42,979 --> 02:15:55,180
somebody? It puts a hat on an emote. So it's just, it's a Santa hat that looks like it's

1247
02:15:55,180 --> 02:16:02,500
on top of the emote. Okay. All right, I gotta pick up crowns. Let's roll them all up before

1248
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:11,920
somebody shows up. Get as many as you can. Super fab gorgeous sky. These crowns must belong to

1249
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:16,159
someone. There are just too many. If a likely person shows up, we'll make a getaway to the

1250
02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:26,180
great cosmos. In the meantime, we have nine minutes. Hurry pilfering prince. That one felt

1251
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:36,000
real fucking good. That was a cheeseburger. That was the Burger King. I missed something

1252
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:42,079
up there. Fuck it. Who cares? We need crowns. Not like baking soda.

1253
02:16:53,420 --> 02:16:59,629
I love the dogs driving the car sharing a crown. What are they moving? What are they

1254
02:16:59,629 --> 02:17:13,979
rolling? They're pushing a can. Why does this have to exist? They're looking for crowns.

1255
02:17:13,979 --> 02:17:32,129
This is going to be annoying. I'm sorry, guys. Hello. Hello. This is the king. Hello.

1256
02:17:32,129 --> 02:17:44,579
Yes, this is Doug. He should have said that. How funny would that have been? Get all the

1257
02:17:44,579 --> 02:18:04,500
swords. I gotta get bigger. Forget about the crowns right now. I have one more. I gotta

1258
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:15,040
level up. What even is this game? This is Katamari Damacy Rerolled. It's a game where

1259
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:19,120
you start small and have to roll up any object you can possibly roll up. That's right. You

1260
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:24,719
can even roll up anything. Everything is roll up-able eventually. You progress through the game

1261
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:30,930
and you have to make stars. It is a one of a kind. You have never experienced it before.

1262
02:18:31,729 --> 02:18:43,950
Oh, is there a treat waiting for you? Cloud was confirmed. That's cool, right?

1263
02:18:52,000 --> 02:19:03,280
Santa please Santa hat. What? No. Sour please Santa hat. Sponsored stream.

1264
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:10,159
Next person that says sponsored stream. You are getting free tickets to Disneyland.

1265
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:26,979
No, you're not. That's a joke. I'm kidding. Oh, did I say Disneyland? Oh, I'm sorry. What

1266
02:19:26,979 --> 02:19:32,819
I meant to say was we're going to go to the website Disneyland. You get free tickets for me

1267
02:19:32,819 --> 02:19:39,280
to show you the website Disneyland. We get to go on a virtual Disneyland tour together.

1268
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:43,440
That's what I meant. I didn't say you physically were getting tickets to physically

1269
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:48,000
go to Disneyland. You get tickets to go to the virtual tour of Disneyland on my stream.

1270
02:19:49,950 --> 02:20:12,850
Now I have to do that. I need so many more crowns. Go to the dark house. Scam. I wonder,

1271
02:20:12,850 --> 02:20:16,049
okay, how much would that actually cost? Were there 4200 people here?

1272
02:20:17,250 --> 02:20:27,489
Isn't a Disneyland ticket like fucking 400 bucks? What's 400 times 4200? And what's

1273
02:20:27,489 --> 02:20:33,489
4200 times all the money that would have to be paid for plane tickets? That's like 20

1274
02:20:33,489 --> 02:20:52,459
million dollars. I need crowns now that I've gotten large enough. Go to Disneyland if you see

1275
02:20:52,459 --> 02:20:57,020
a crown, okay? Anybody that sees a crown can scream Disneyland and then they'll, you know,

1276
02:20:58,059 --> 02:21:09,520
you know what I mean. Disneyland. I'm not big enough for that one. I'll get one of the

1277
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:18,819
guys bumped. I'm not falling off. There are a lot of crowns down here though. But I'm not,

1278
02:21:18,819 --> 02:21:37,680
I can't get up on these. I can barely get them. I believe you owe me some tickets. Get

1279
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:57,760
bigger. I'm trying. Free tickets to Disneyland. Just get bigger already. Just go to Disneyland

1280
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:30,270
already. I'm kidding. I know the present is there. What's in it? One of our royal presents.

1281
02:22:30,270 --> 02:22:50,319
It's tickets to Disneyland. Free tickets to Disneyland. When was the last time you guys went

1282
02:22:50,319 --> 02:23:02,739
to Disneyland? Overused joke. We just made it five minutes ago. We just brought that up

1283
02:23:02,739 --> 02:23:18,559
like not even 10 minutes ago. Old joke. When was the last time Disneyland went to you?

1284
02:23:20,299 --> 02:23:24,139
Does it count if you hire like a Mickey Mouse mascot to dance at a Christmas party?

1285
02:23:24,139 --> 02:23:33,170
Not a Christmas party. A birthday party. I only have 30 of these. I need more crowns.

1286
02:23:34,180 --> 02:23:48,459
How did I miss all of them? Christmas party. What kind of fucked up Christmas party is that?

1287
02:23:49,180 --> 02:24:11,059
Can I get these? Ah! Yes! Big crown. That's a huge crown right there and I can't touch it. I hate

1288
02:24:11,059 --> 02:24:28,620
this. I want that. I can't pick that one up. You have one minute left to get. I've got to get

1289
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:43,329
to 50 right? Or you can't get through there. Why? It's all ruined again. No it's okay.

1290
02:24:43,329 --> 02:24:48,620
He's sponsored by Disney. No. No I'm not sponsored by Disney. No one gets Disneyland

1291
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:56,430
tickets. It was a reference to a tv show. I was watching a tv show where the host gave out tickets

1292
02:24:56,430 --> 02:25:18,940
to Disneyland to everybody in the audience. It may have been Oprah. 43. It can't be a number

1293
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:23,819
like that. I will restart the whole fucking level if it's 43. It's got to be like even 45 or

1294
02:25:23,819 --> 02:25:35,360
something. Oh thank god. Someone's coming. Oh we can't open our eyes. It's too dazzling.

1295
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:45,659
Let's take a look at our rainbow. 45 is not even 44 is. Boy we failed that one. It's all right.

1296
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:58,239
Well it's 44 crowns. Only a measly 44 so it'll be a bland constellation. Here this is our

1297
02:25:58,239 --> 02:26:02,879
royal present. It's a crown. Guess what? Guess what this is. Alrighty let's just release it

1298
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:17,409
into the sky. We're still on the same level from an hour ago? I mean that was the same

1299
02:26:17,409 --> 02:26:28,340
area. Different mission. That looked like shit. He said crap. I don't know why I turned

1300
02:26:28,340 --> 02:26:32,020
it into a swear. There was no reason for me to do that. I just transferred what you said.

1301
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:44,350
They said this looks like crap and I said shit. Thank you Cuman. Cuman gave 10 community

1302
02:26:44,350 --> 02:26:54,110
subs earlier. Thank you Cuman. Appreciate it. 10 community subs. I missed them. I didn't see

1303
02:26:54,110 --> 02:27:01,729
them. But we have to crown them. We can't have the scarf on. That's kind of... Give us

1304
02:27:01,729 --> 02:27:27,200
more slots Valve. What the hell? Yeah we'll keep the crown on. Looks good. Sponsored by Valve.

1305
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:43,360
Mega Star 6. Let's see what we've opened up. Is that the only one? I think that's the only one.

1306
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:56,159
This is the end of the game. Level 6. So when are you going to go back to beat Dark Souls 3

1307
02:27:56,159 --> 02:28:03,969
without taking damage? I wouldn't be able to do that for a million dollars. Like for literally

1308
02:28:03,969 --> 02:28:10,049
a million dollars. I wouldn't be able to do it. Have you ever been to the Arabian Peninsula?

1309
02:28:10,049 --> 02:28:18,209
We haven't either. We hope you can visit during the day's rolling. Really? Could you?

1310
02:28:18,209 --> 02:28:24,459
Okay. Could you right now if somebody sat down with a briefcase and said there's a million dollars

1311
02:28:24,459 --> 02:28:30,700
in cash here and it's just ready for you to take it and it's been taxed. It's been pre-taxed.

1312
02:28:30,700 --> 02:28:35,819
So you're fine. Like that's it. It's just cash. But you have to beat Dark Souls 3 without taking

1313
02:28:35,819 --> 02:28:41,440
one hit. Like right there in front of like right there right now in front of this guy.

1314
02:28:42,479 --> 02:28:52,420
That would be easy. Yes that would be dumb not to do it. But how you wouldn't be able

1315
02:28:52,420 --> 02:28:58,340
to do it? It would be impossible. You gave your present away to somebody on earth.

1316
02:28:58,420 --> 02:29:05,020
Must be around somewhere. Roll it up while you're at it. Whoa you guys got real fucking dark.

1317
02:29:07,379 --> 02:29:12,270
It's not impossible. It is not impossible. But what's gonna happen is you're gonna because

1318
02:29:12,270 --> 02:29:16,030
you haven't played Dark Souls 3 in like seven months. You're gonna load it up. Be like I'm

1319
02:29:16,030 --> 02:29:19,469
gonna try. I'm gonna at least give it my first attempt. And you're gonna get a hit by like

1320
02:29:19,469 --> 02:29:24,239
the third enemy. You're gonna be in the graveyard and you're gonna fuck up a dodge because you

1321
02:29:24,239 --> 02:29:27,649
haven't played in a while and you're gonna take the hit. And he's gonna go

1322
02:29:27,889 --> 02:29:33,969
ha ha ha grab the briefcase close it up like see you later fucking loser

1323
02:29:33,969 --> 02:29:36,610
and he walks out it's but it was so close it was right there in front of you

1324
02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:53,809
all right we need a crisp three meters just tackle him i'm sorry about that there are

1325
02:29:53,809 --> 02:30:01,549
30 bodyguards with him like like i'm sorry oh just like steal it i'll take it from him

1326
02:30:01,549 --> 02:30:12,829
okay good luck and these 30 bodyguards are so big that they can barely fit in your

1327
02:30:12,829 --> 02:30:18,260
bedroom like only two of them can fit in your room they're like seven feet tall

1328
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:28,620
and they weigh at least like a like 290 like to like 350 pounds each and just for just

1329
02:30:28,620 --> 02:30:34,459
because like you lost so you like quickly one of the huge bodyguards just fucking karate

1330
02:30:34,459 --> 02:30:53,760

1406
02:47:00,370 --> 02:47:09,950

1407
02:47:10,750 --> 02:47:14,670
i was actually gonna ask that but i felt scared that somebody you know people would be like wow

1408
02:47:14,670 --> 02:47:19,069
you don't think stingray is a fish and i knew i was probably correct that stingray is not a fish

1409
02:47:19,069 --> 02:47:27,459
but you know i didn't want to get ridiculed the same he did this who flattened this like a

03:59:07,899 --> 03:59:19,649
i'm too big but not big enough to matter up here all the stationary cars get them all all

1695
03:59:19,649 --> 03:59:29,729

1702
04:01:26,989 --> 04:01:41,700

1703
04:01:41,700 --> 04:01:52,180
but well it's possible but i don't know even bigger

1704
04:01:59,329 --> 04:02:10,379
in case you were wondering now i'm in the clouds now i'm too big to even understand

1705
04:02:11,020 --> 04:02:18,940
and this is not even close to as big as you can get my game 21 like what else is it for me

1706
04:02:18,940 --> 04:02:41,520
to pick up 22.46 glad we got that one though it's pretty big we imagine it'll

1707
04:02:41,520 --> 04:02:47,500
make a pretty good store if it were ours we'd make it much bigger the most thing you got was

1708
04:02:47,500 --> 04:03:06,379
plants well that makes sense i'm running over dirt green that's it

1709
04:03:17,860 --> 04:03:18,659
i'm gonna mute my mic

1710
04:03:23,700 --> 04:03:41,579
i mean that was that was disgusting i'm trying to drink this is a straw supposed

1711
04:03:41,579 --> 04:03:44,540
to go in this cup but i don't have the straw so i have to suck it out of the top

1712
04:03:53,409 --> 04:04:00,559
i have to drain i have to bite into this like a snake vergo vergo or let's make sure

1713
04:04:02,620 --> 04:04:11,379
you overfill the drink no the drink has a lid on it that a straw is supposed to go through

1714
04:04:11,940 --> 04:04:15,139
like through the little hole but i don't have the straw and i don't have a straw

1715
04:04:15,940 --> 04:04:22,379
so i have to have to drain it through the top it's lacking a certain something

1716
04:04:22,379 --> 04:04:25,180
is it our royal present no that's not it oh yes we get it

1717
04:04:25,819 --> 04:04:34,219
prettiness the sky is not pretty at all it's rough and masculine possibly sweaty what we want is

1718
04:04:34,219 --> 04:04:46,940
pure girlish prettiness there should be loads of maidens like those on earth take the top off

1719
04:04:46,940 --> 04:05:10,700
and drink it like a cup why didn't i do that though i just could i could just take off the

1720
04:05:10,700 --> 04:05:19,629
lid but but hold on hold on let me let me give me i could have some defense here

1721
04:05:21,020 --> 04:05:24,290
i didn't touch anything somebody kicked me down the stairs

1722
04:05:27,329 --> 04:05:37,500

1827
04:30:35,569 --> 04:30:58,610

where the fuck am i supposed to even go right now i need to get back up there

1829
04:31:04,399 --> 04:31:10,399

1833
04:31:57,489 --> 04:32:02,290
where the hell is it down this way

1834
04:32:16,180 --> 04:32:22,930
i'm not big enough to roll over this yet and what fucking messed up reality are you talking

1835
04:32:22,930 --> 04:32:50,639
about here what reality is this problem though how am i gonna fit through that

1836
04:32:52,270 --> 04:33:08,139
oh oh oh that's that's thank god i'm not five meters bigger this is where it starts

1837
04:33:08,700 --> 04:33:23,470
nothing's seriously wrong with this building trees oh i can't get the trees yet shit

1838
04:33:23,470 --> 04:33:34,880
six seven no playground equipment

1839
04:33:49,979 --> 04:33:57,919
nice good time to beep all right what about this way is there anything up here kind of

1840
04:34:04,909 --> 04:34:08,669
bulls this might have been a bad idea but i could probably get the fence yeah i kept good

1841
04:34:11,069 --> 04:34:34,139
fence adds a lot of height i get you bulls okay i got it i can pick up the bulls am i big

1842
04:34:34,139 --> 04:34:47,220
enough to take down the whole barn i gotta get down there again let's go right off the edge

1843
04:34:49,380 --> 04:35:04,819
momentum and all right well like apparently that didn't want to work ask me why

1844
04:35:08,939 --> 04:35:22,369
trees yet why these guys driving around in this parking lot is this like a driving test

1845
04:35:28,900 --> 04:35:35,500
all right where from here though over there all the mushrooms all right i'm going that way

1846
04:35:36,299 --> 04:35:53,709
wait i don't think i can even get in there i don't think i can roll in there yet

1847
04:36:02,479 --> 04:36:05,680
oh it's so awkward to control it's too big

1848
04:36:10,979 --> 04:36:27,069
fuck how are you supposed to hit the brakes on that where am i going right now have had

1849
04:36:27,069 --> 04:36:30,990
i've ruined everything by trying to dumb jump when nothing is even over there there's nothing

1850
04:36:30,990 --> 04:36:43,919
even over there worth picking up there's a handful of solar panels i've just lost weight

1851
04:36:43,919 --> 04:37:00,860
doing what i did what is coming what all right trees are now able to be picked up

1852
04:37:01,819 --> 04:37:05,700
at least the smaller ones that's good because that's how i'm going to get the height necessary

1853
04:37:05,700 --> 04:37:32,080
to keep going i only have six minutes left good still in diapers says you exponential let's go

1854
04:37:32,959 --> 04:37:43,900

1858
04:38:51,540 --> 04:38:55,860
little gamer achievement i don't know i don't care about gamer achievements i want to beat the

1859
04:38:55,860 --> 04:39:23,330
level it seems like a good place to get some weight it sure is all right there's apparently

1860
04:39:23,330 --> 04:39:41,099
a big battle going on what do we need 20 now it's 30 nice okay can i get the cylinders up

1873
04:43:41,259 --> 04:43:51,500
to get together with your cousin so we'll go back to space if i'm not mistaken i think you

1874
04:43:51,500 --> 04:44:01,740
can actually roll up the entire world first goal but it's not very exciting is it we want

1875
04:44:01,740 --> 04:44:21,139
a bigger one next time plants how is luggage in third place have to pick up houses the whole

1876
04:44:21,139 --> 04:44:30,349
universe man

1877
04:44:52,000 --> 04:45:07,729
and the moon is gone can i get a new present no i'm already wearing it why do you need a

1878
04:45:07,729 --> 04:45:23,490
telescope for that oh change the spin move right the game controls sound constellations

1879
04:45:26,049 --> 04:45:46,669
control type motion controls i want to play with motion control i just controls check

1880
04:45:47,630 --> 04:45:57,659
so this is okay this is motion controls both uh no thanks i just want that bottom left one

1881
04:45:57,659 --> 04:46:19,060
that's all i want what is simple simple uh oh charge and roll look at that quick turn is

1882
04:46:19,540 --> 04:46:33,680
okay hold on this might be better no i like the usual controls i like because essentially

1883
04:46:33,680 --> 04:46:39,389
looks like you pretend you have two hands on the ball so your thumbs are your two hands and

1884
04:46:39,470 --> 04:46:42,750
you have to do the motion that with your hands is what you'd be like in real life

1885
04:46:43,630 --> 04:46:48,029
you want to spin the ball to the left you hold off on the right one you spin with your you

1886
04:46:48,029 --> 04:46:53,099
know your left hand you push with your left hand the charging rules the only thing that

1887
04:46:53,099 --> 04:47:00,509
sucks on here yeah the jump is the it's not the uh it's the prince you just jump in the

1888
04:47:00,509 --> 04:47:12,080
air and look down well i guess we can't really change it so it's all right um make

1889
04:47:12,080 --> 04:47:19,970
the moon is what is remaining nice and that's it make the moon

1890
04:47:23,520 --> 04:47:35,549
i'm using shit controls what are you talking about uh do you know esperanto maybe we'll

1891
04:47:35,549 --> 04:47:41,470
invent a cosmic esperanto oh yes almost forgot oh yes a royal present for the hard-working

1892
04:47:41,470 --> 04:47:46,590
prince but we felt bashful about handing it to you so we left it on earth you can roll

1893
04:47:46,590 --> 04:47:59,650
it up when you're making the moon movies programs elephants wraps the whole thing

1894
04:47:59,650 --> 04:48:12,180
today you'll be rolling around the world the catamari should be let's see around 300 meters

1895
04:48:12,180 --> 04:48:32,270
300 you have 25 minutes 300 okay here we go and it's the it's the song and it's the song

1922
04:55:34,209 --> 04:55:39,439
how do i get out of this little quadrant i can't see up there

1923
04:55:44,500 --> 04:55:56,639
do

1924
04:56:23,979 --> 04:56:41,459
20 minutes to get to 300 not even close but it's all right back this way

1925
04:56:43,659 --> 04:56:45,650
i thought the song was over it's not

1926
04:56:46,130 --> 04:56:52,139

1928
04:57:12,139 --> 04:57:20,380
i can get these though that thing right there says well i don't think i can go over there

1929
04:57:36,560 --> 04:57:59,779

little trees

1932
04:58:22,689 --> 04:58:41,540

2030
05:22:00,060 --> 05:22:16,819
hey the sky isn't finished yet well that is the base uh game you might say it looks a little

2031
05:22:16,819 --> 05:22:22,500
short the main little story little little cute story there oh that's because this is a

2032
05:22:22,500 --> 05:22:33,500
playstation 2 game but it's not over it's not over because you can do this as many times as

2033
05:22:33,500 --> 05:22:51,630
you want there's a lot to do and get high scores and this is just the first one so i do have

2034
05:22:51,630 --> 05:23:01,599
to try i have to do this is there identical levels oh yeah but i mean you can redo them

2035
05:23:02,240 --> 05:23:07,360
and that eternal mode is i think you can just do it as long as you want

2036
05:23:07,840 --> 05:23:22,619
um it's a fun game there are a ton of sequels and the sequels are much larger and way more

2037
05:23:23,819 --> 05:23:25,500
going on especially in some of the later ones

2038
05:23:30,900 --> 05:23:35,779
how many catamari games are there i missed one new one

2039
05:23:39,700 --> 05:23:49,439
all right let me try to get a decent beer there are like five new ones what what did i

2040
05:23:49,439 --> 05:24:06,349
miss five new levels a couple games too because i would really love i mean i know they did this

2041
05:24:06,349 --> 05:24:11,549
and this is this is cool but they went back i just fucking uh whatever a bear carving of a

2042
05:24:11,549 --> 05:24:14,590
bear it doesn't even look like a bear on the ground whatever that's the smallest one i've

2043
05:24:14,590 --> 05:24:20,700
picked up so far that is tiny that is the smallest one that's i'm not gonna go

2044
05:24:38,799 --> 05:24:47,900
i buy food and eat it the same day all right let me see what you're talking about

2045
05:24:48,779 --> 05:24:56,619
because i don't think there isn't is this up here the new levels are oh oh what would you look at

2046
05:24:56,619 --> 05:25:03,360
that would you look at that there's a there is a new level i told you the game wasn't over

2047
05:25:03,360 --> 05:25:13,009
make the north star for some reason for some reason i don't feel comfortable at all

2048
05:25:13,810 --> 05:25:19,069
is it because our royal present is missing no that's not oh well that's it we get there's

2049
05:25:19,069 --> 05:25:23,810
no center there is no belly button there is nothing solid in the center of the sky

2050
05:25:24,770 --> 05:25:32,290
that's why it's unstable off kilter undignified and preposterous but we remember now it's the

2051
05:25:32,290 --> 05:25:54,529
north star this level sucks who knows why but make it exactly 10 meters the closer it is to

2052
05:25:54,529 --> 05:26:00,529
10 meters the brighter a north star will be but there's a catch or maybe two how big the

2053
05:26:00,689 --> 05:26:06,209
katamari is to start with nobody knows but we will show you what 10 meters looks like

2054
05:26:07,169 --> 05:26:18,240
ready 10 meters very very simple what when you think your katamari is 10 meters summon us with

2055
05:26:18,240 --> 05:26:28,610
the y button much is expected of you prince of wait what oh shit okay i have to guess

2056
05:26:28,610 --> 05:26:44,580
when it's 10 meters i still have no idea well how wait wait wait how big am i now i'm big

2057
05:26:44,580 --> 05:26:56,240
enough to pick up people so i'm definitely at least two meters right that circle up there

2058
05:26:56,240 --> 05:27:22,529
in the top left is how big i need to look okay how tall a car is three meters three feet so

2061
05:28:00,689 --> 05:28:27,310
hold on too fast come on wait am i i'm pretty big i'm probably five or probably six meters

2062
05:28:27,310 --> 05:29:08,290
right now easy easy easy slow down don't go so fast you're like two meters sure i gotta stay

2063
05:29:08,290 --> 05:29:30,130
next to a tree all right and right now i'm like as big as a tree right now i'm gonna go

2064
05:29:32,900 --> 05:29:58,860
way way too small go away and start over 10 meters 30 feet so i don't really have a

2065
05:29:58,860 --> 05:30:23,229
kilometer to how tall these things are double the size i'm pretty big right now oh shit okay

2183
05:53:26,209 --> 05:53:33,459
we live in different states so that would be very difficult to do that it would take a

long time for me to to pull that off steal it steal his mic i how do you want me to do

2198
05:55:44,509 --> 05:55:50,270

sitting in a like we kind of are no but we're not at a comedy club and i'm not on stage

2252
06:03:38,130 --> 06:03:48,740
with a mic yes i am there's a mic right here i'm in a digital stage fuck i guess i'm

2253
06:03:48,740 --> 06:03:59,569
wrong i guess that was incorrect just stream comedy night no because comedy night is

2254
06:03:59,569 --> 06:04:04,689
when that came out i was like oh that might be interesting to do and then i saw a couple of

2255
06:04:04,689 --> 06:04:10,049
videos of people just like getting in close to their mics like you get like a one minute

2256
06:04:10,049 --> 06:04:13,970
turn and then you have to watch like eight fucking dickheads come up and be like

2257
06:04:19,490 --> 06:04:21,650
and then it's like all right it was what's happening with the next guy

2258
06:04:28,560 --> 06:04:30,880
then you get your turn again in like a minute and then you try to come up with a

2259
06:04:30,880 --> 06:04:44,509
funny joke and then you get booed he did not peek he did peek the mic did i know i didn't i

2260
06:04:44,509 --> 06:04:58,029
turned it down so no no comedy night maybe at real comedy club comedy night if i ever want

2261
06:04:58,029 --> 06:05:02,930
to publicly embarrass myself for like an hour and no it wouldn't even be an hour that's why

2262
06:05:02,930 --> 06:05:08,080
how would i stream that that would be like a 12 minute stream you only get like six or seven

2263
06:05:08,080 --> 06:05:12,159
minutes when you go on stage for an open mic night you don't get like an hour it's not like

2264
06:05:12,319 --> 06:05:17,200
presenting germa 985 and it's like oh yeah there he is and i come out and get an hour and a half on

2265
06:05:17,200 --> 06:05:27,779
the stage no i get like three minutes i'm gonna go up there and tell like three awful jokes and

2266
06:05:27,779 --> 06:05:40,779
no one's gonna think it's funny and then i'm gonna turn the stream off just put on disguises

2267
06:05:40,779 --> 06:05:49,470
and go more than once and then i'll get thrown out of this comedy club and that would be

2268
06:05:49,470 --> 06:05:59,340
that would be even more embarrassing because then i can never go back there it'll be funny

2269
06:06:00,299 --> 06:06:10,509
all right well sure i'll go get banned from a comedy club on stream that sounds like a great

2270
06:06:10,509 --> 06:06:17,470
time to me i'll get like thrown out and then we can sit on the sidewalk and chat for like

2271
06:06:17,470 --> 06:06:35,009

2331
06:16:20,750 --> 06:16:28,369
stupid i don't know why everyone's so why is everybody so afraid of the internet you know

2332
06:16:28,369 --> 06:16:31,330
what i mean that's what's been around for so long at this point like are we why are people

2333
06:16:31,330 --> 06:16:48,619
so scared of the internet it's like what what's the problem here it's because they saw the

2334
06:16:48,619 --> 06:17:01,540
spay video now i don't know the the complete and total ins and outs of article 13 but there's

2335
06:17:01,540 --> 06:17:06,900
been shit like that before and this the stuff is already like happening where it's like no no no

2336
06:17:06,900 --> 06:17:11,779
nobody can have the internet right hold on a second somebody hold on a second somebody

2337
06:17:11,779 --> 06:17:18,500
hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you were in you were inside of a mall

2338
06:17:19,459 --> 06:17:26,580
and the mall was playing a song over the radio and in that song somebody said there was a

2339
06:17:26,580 --> 06:17:33,139
sample or there was a there was a fucking sample from a tv show everybody in the mall is under

2340
06:17:33,139 --> 06:17:45,279
arrest well how do i don't understand how are they gonna do that hold on there's an internet

2341
06:17:45,279 --> 06:17:50,240
person on here that just played a song that they don't have the rights to you're all going to

2342
06:17:50,240 --> 06:17:57,840
jail like you know when you're walking around in walmart and they're just playing fucking

2343
06:17:57,840 --> 06:18:02,319
music they're playing like ads and shit you know they think they think walmart has the

2344
06:18:02,319 --> 06:18:08,720
rights to play fucking whatever local radio station is blasting songs through the the pa

2345
06:18:16,299 --> 06:18:28,020
they do they do they actually do i hear like radio stations so mr walmart gets the rights

2346
06:18:28,020 --> 06:18:51,619
to like 10 000 radio stations i mean i i understand people and you know companies wanting

2347
06:18:51,619 --> 06:18:59,389
to be paid for services and stuff and but i don't i don't think blocking and banning is

2348
06:18:59,389 --> 06:19:04,400
the the right way to do it because how are you supposed to share things with people you know

2349
06:19:04,400 --> 06:19:08,560
what i mean like how like you see hey hey dude come here i found this really cool song that

2350
06:19:08,560 --> 06:19:13,040
i want you to listen to take a listen oh hey but uh you gotta pay me first though

2351
06:19:13,599 --> 06:19:26,380
but how you supposed to like share stuff you know what i mean like if you think about it it's

2352
06:19:26,380 --> 06:19:32,700
very core it's people used to sit around and listen to like a record player right

2353
06:19:33,659 --> 06:19:42,220
and now we've gotten so connected that the new record player where everyone's hanging out

2354
06:19:42,220 --> 06:19:47,340
in the room listening to like 30 people all at a party listening to a record you know you people

2355
06:19:47,340 --> 06:19:54,369
are streaming or listening to the radio or playing music or it's a new world it's a different you

2356
06:19:54,369 --> 06:19:57,889
know it's hard to i understand the difficulty in trying to figure out how to go about

2357
06:19:57,889 --> 06:20:20,259
policing it and figuring it out but it's almost impossible where's my money but there's

2358
06:20:20,259 --> 06:20:26,430
i think there's a difference between you know obviously like this dmca takedowns and stuff

2359
06:20:26,430 --> 06:20:34,080
but outright banning websites is just don't we already have systems in place that do this

2360
06:20:34,080 --> 06:20:40,689
shit already don't we already have systems that will take things down or monetize for

2361
06:20:40,689 --> 06:20:53,819
whoever the creator is or do we have to ban entire websites boomers like germa ruin everything

2362
06:21:05,470 --> 06:21:22,939
germa no i don't want to get political here or go any further than that but i think there's i

2363
06:21:22,939 --> 06:21:26,700
think there's a different way you can go about doing that and outright it was it's the same ship

2364
06:21:26,700 --> 06:21:32,540
with like the net neutrality stuff is well uh if you have verizon uh you can't go to netflix

2365
06:21:32,540 --> 06:21:39,259
anymore if you have comcast or you can go to netflix it's just why why does that even have

2366
06:21:39,259 --> 06:21:56,619
to be a thing why could why would that even be a possibility because money i guess i just

2367
06:21:56,619 --> 06:22:08,159
feel like there's a better way oh because of big bits germa isn't even a good boomer he's a left

2368
06:22:08,159 --> 06:22:21,229
for dead 2 boomer a good boomer a left for dead boomer what are you talking about fat

2369
06:22:28,830 --> 06:22:35,009
but talking about stuff like this is a whole can it's a can of worms that when it's opened

2370
06:22:35,009 --> 06:22:48,020
is just there's so much to even discuss there's too much to discuss and i mean we

2371
06:22:48,020 --> 06:22:55,279
could sit here all night and talk about this kind of shit but i hope that uh sensible hope

2372
06:22:55,279 --> 06:23:01,250
there are sensible things that are done and that people don't just jump right to conclusions

2373
06:23:01,250 --> 06:23:11,099
immediately it's just like almost like hey we gotta get to it right now we're gonna do

2374
06:23:11,099 --> 06:23:15,659
it right now we have to change the internet now tonight tomorrow hurry hurry do it do it

2375
06:23:15,659 --> 06:23:21,740
do it we're gonna just go come on it's like this is one of the most important mediums

2376
06:23:22,619 --> 06:23:28,159
in history i think it needs to be treated with a little more let's talk let's figure this shit

2377
06:23:28,159 --> 06:23:42,299
out you know what i mean like the the probably most important thing that's happened in the last

2378
06:23:42,299 --> 06:23:47,919
30 years 40 at least 50 years in regards to technology right the internet especially where

2379
06:23:47,919 --> 06:23:53,900
it is now technologically is just i mean you're talking about like the invention of the

2380
06:23:53,900 --> 06:24:06,799
fucking wheel back in the caveman times as an important politician i'd like to know what

2381
06:24:06,880 --> 06:24:12,000
this internet thing is this is nice background music for political discussion

2382
06:24:16,020 --> 06:24:17,619
i wasn't even listening to it

2383
06:24:24,099 --> 06:24:26,580
yeah this is like didn't fit oh well

2384
06:24:31,299 --> 06:24:37,169
the fact that we are watching this stream right now would blow people's minds back in the 90s

2385
06:24:37,169 --> 06:24:49,619
oh that's what i mean it's such an insane stepping stone for humanity that it needs to be done

2386
06:24:50,590 --> 06:24:55,310
in i think a lot slower a lot different and a lot more people need to be part of the equation

2387
06:24:57,700 --> 06:25:01,380
you know it can't just be like three guys that are like i think this is what it should be

2388
06:25:01,939 --> 06:25:18,909
no you gotta get every more people gotta be fucking involved with that shit but regardless

2389
06:25:18,909 --> 06:25:34,380
of any of this you need to have at least four guys in that room we're gonna we're

2390
06:25:34,380 --> 06:25:50,029
gonna implant memes into our dna but we'll see what happens by all i can say is what i've just

2391
06:25:50,029 --> 06:26:01,069
previously said and again i'm i'm coming from a place of somewhat ignorance because i don't

2392
06:26:01,069 --> 06:26:06,029
really know that much about how it is in the eu i mean because i don't live there

2393
06:26:06,750 --> 06:26:09,869
so i don't know how your day-to-day goes with stuff like that i know there's a lot

2394
06:26:09,869 --> 06:26:16,189
of different rules in different countries so i get all i can say is i hope that it's not

2395
06:26:17,150 --> 06:26:21,580
i hope that it doesn't do what it's what it says that people are afraid is going to happen you

2396
06:26:21,580 --> 06:26:36,340
know what i mean because that's a whole can of worms you don't live in the eu

2397
06:26:38,419 --> 06:26:42,240
it would be really weird if i did i'd be streaming at some weird fucking time

2406
06:27:44,459 --> 06:27:54,509
sneezing i just forced my yeah i'm good scariest film or show you've ever seen

2407
06:27:57,860 --> 06:28:04,770
movies don't really scare me because a lot of scary movies at least that are made in the

2408
06:28:04,770 --> 06:28:14,319
last 10 years are guy with like a mask on or something and flashing lights and and they're

2409
06:28:14,319 --> 06:28:20,000
in the script right in front of the screen and it doesn't like scare me it's just like oh

2410
06:28:20,000 --> 06:28:27,970
okay that was like annoying all right i wouldn't even classify it as a jump scare because you

2411
06:28:27,970 --> 06:28:42,750
are it's you know what's gonna happen so far away so i don't know a truly scary um actually

2412
06:28:42,750 --> 06:28:57,490
i will tell you the the first uh hereditary was actually really fucked up that movie was

2413
06:28:57,490 --> 06:29:03,619
just unsettling so i don't know but like it didn't scare me but it was unsettling

2414
06:29:08,419 --> 06:29:13,380
so i mean maybe that i put that in that category of scary that means scared unsettled

2415
06:29:15,650 --> 06:29:31,259
disturbing yeah if you've never seen hereditary it's it's quite a strange wild ride have i seen the

06:29:31,259 --> 06:29:37,069
sonic movie poster yes i have i don't know they're going but i don't know what they're

2461
06:36:34,540 --> 06:36:37,500
thanks for the one dollar hey germa what movies are you looking forward to recently

2462
06:36:38,560 --> 06:36:47,919
uh the new avengers movie and i would have said venom like a couple months ago but i

2463
06:36:47,919 --> 06:37:08,590
did see venom and i loved that movie i loved that movie i thought it was great i thought it was

2464
06:37:08,590 --> 06:37:26,959
one of the best movies i've seen in like the last couple years 17 on rotten tomatoes

2465
06:37:32,430 --> 06:37:37,259
no all right let me tell you let me tell you the truth here though that movie was

2466
06:37:37,259 --> 06:37:42,849
really really it was really like stupid but i think people were a little too hard on it i

2467
06:37:42,849 --> 06:37:50,459
thought i think they marketed that movie completely incorrectly i don't think that

2468
06:37:50,459 --> 06:37:57,139
movie should have been marketed as oh it's venom spider-man and it's a venom movie no

2469
06:37:57,139 --> 06:38:02,159
you market that movie as like a shitty buddy cop that why would you market that as anything

2470
06:38:02,159 --> 06:38:23,060
else yeah i i mean it was it a good movie in quotes no that wasn't a good movie but i had a

2471
06:38:23,060 --> 06:38:31,009
good i had a good time watching it i think a lot of people were expecting something and yes

2472
06:38:31,009 --> 06:38:37,900
yes i know the movie was supposed to be rated r and then they pulled it to pg-13 and there

2473
06:38:37,900 --> 06:38:42,619
was a lot of scenes that they cut and yeah that's i mean come on are you gonna whatever

2474
06:38:42,619 --> 06:38:56,930
they're trying to appeal to as broad of an audience as they can what wait what's going on

2475
06:38:56,930 --> 06:39:08,860
no stop what what's going on here sony shill what i just told you that the movie was bad

2476
06:39:09,419 --> 06:39:16,529
i just told you it was not a good movie but that the bad movies that are not good

2477
06:39:17,169 --> 06:39:24,240
does not disqualify them from being entertaining you know what i'm saying that you don't a movie

2478
06:39:24,240 --> 06:39:41,069
doesn't have to be good to be worth watching i love watching bad movies yeah i mean like you

2479
06:39:41,069 --> 06:39:47,099
just if if you like venom you liked venom if you didn't like venom then you didn't because

2480
06:39:47,099 --> 06:39:52,060
i mean obviously we can all probably agree the movie wasn't very good so you're correct but

2481
06:39:52,060 --> 06:39:57,259
the guy that liked venom is is not wrong no neither oh no don't spill another thing i

2482
06:39:57,259 --> 06:40:06,779
that's why i had the lid on that's why this fucking lid was on that's why i was drinking

2483
06:40:06,779 --> 06:40:20,450
out of it out of the top like a child fuck venom the movie was stupid but i liked it i

2484
06:40:20,450 --> 06:40:36,080
thought it was funny all right hold on all right it wasn't that bad i'm fine it was just like

2485
06:40:36,080 --> 06:40:50,979
a lot it was a little bit that's why i had the top on in this fucking thing there wasn't

2486
06:40:50,979 --> 06:40:56,740
that much left in it so it went in a very easy blood splat pattern for me to clean up but

2487
06:40:56,740 --> 06:41:20,959
it was still aggravating all right what the hell were we just talking about dude dude drinks

2488
06:41:20,959 --> 06:41:28,159
blood no i don't yes no i didn't mean to say yes i don't drink blood

2489
06:41:37,040 --> 06:41:42,479
that's like my body and brain were fighting my brain was so desperately saying yes and my
