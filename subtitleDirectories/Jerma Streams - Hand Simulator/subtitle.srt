1
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:12,230
All right, hi. Hello everybody. How's it going? How's your day?

2
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:26,570
A lot of stuff going on. About 15 minutes before, 20 minutes before, about to start the stream.

3
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,089
I had to make sure that Kim got to the doctor because she's not feeling well.

4
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:40,460
That was just popped up. I'm just coming off a few days of being disoriented from

5
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:48,340
having a procedure done to me and then we had to move Halo to tomorrow.

6
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,939
And then I had to talk to like a bunch of people. Today's been a busy, busy, busy day.

7
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:07,219
I almost read that out loud. It was really close for me to read that out loud.

8
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:22,310
Yeah, she's okay. How do I feel? Well, I've gotten a few answers and I'm not sure what

9
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,760
that means for these answers, but it means I have to keep going. I have to keep figuring stuff out.

10
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:48,140
But some of the things I thought were real are real. It's kind of a weird scenario. I have a

11
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:58,439
hernia. Let's just put it that way. I have a hiatal hernia and I might also have costochondritis,

12
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,959
which is inflammation in your ribs. Like my rib cage is like fucked up or something.

13
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:17,689
So, it's been a weird, it's been an interesting couple days. Let's put it that way. Am I all right?

14
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:22,340
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm doing all right. I'm fine. I got a hernia from laughing too hard. I don't think

15
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:37,259
so. I don't think that's how you get a hiatal hernia, but the harder I laugh, the more I'm in

16
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:53,689
pain. The hernia is just a hair ball in his stomach, but I still don't know exactly what's

17
00:02:53,689 --> 00:03:00,340
going on. So, that was literally like two and a half, three days ago. So, hey, this is what's

18
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,340
going on. This might be something else going on. We're going to go talk to somebody else now.

19
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:19,300
The game board of figuring out medical issues is just, we move like two more spaces to the right.

20
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:28,360
You know, we rolled two and now, okay, when can we land on Park Place? Can I land on the boardwalk

21
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,639
yet? Like when do I pass a go? No, no, no. You landed on Baltic Avenue. That place sucks.

22
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, I don't want Baltic Avenue. You're going to have to wait until next week. So,

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,539
you have to wait two weeks to go to take another turn. Oh, okay. Siri, don't, I'm not talking to

24
00:03:51,539 --> 00:04:01,879
you, Siri. Get out of here. Don't record this, Siri. Don't record me. Anyways, I need to make

25
00:04:01,879 --> 00:05:00,100
a tweet. All right, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Okay. Sorry, I'm like texting people

26
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:09,079
to this. This like, it's the busiest day of the fucking year, apparently. But we are today,

27
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,079
today is not even a stream. Let me just be very, very clear about this. I was going to go three

28
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:21,639
days in a row starting with Halo, but Halo had to get pushed to tomorrow. I think Joel was doing

29
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,680
something that he wanted to finish. So I was like, yeah, that's fine. Let's go. And then on Friday,

30
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,040
we're probably going to do that tools up game. So we're just doing four days in a row because

31
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,540
like I'm still, I'm back. I'm coming back. So we'll just do probably three, four straight days in a

32
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:47,459
row as of today and tomorrow. What that means is we get to play a game that I've wanted to play

33
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,300
and everyone hates for some reason. Hey, I hate this game. This game sucks. This game's stupid.

34
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:06,579
Don't play that game. Well, I already bought it. So I'm just going to, we're just going to hang out

35
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:13,850
for a little while. And this is, this is a stream that's not even a real stream. The real stream

36
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:20,459
starts tomorrow. This is the pre stream comeback stream. We're going to be playing. Of course,

37
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:39,670
I'm talking about hand simulator. This one's not canon. I saw one person say, yes, this is the,

38
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:48,089
this is the halo reach tomorrow waiting room. Yes, I'm aware. All right. So how hand simulator

39
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:58,310
works for those of you that don't know, you just use your hands. You get to play with fidget spinners.

40
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:10,439
That was cool. The milkmaid, Merry Christmas and horror. Are we gaming? No. Well, let's do the fidget

41
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,139
spinners. Let's get it out of the way. This might be really loud too. I have no idea. Is it going to

42
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:27,620
be loud? It's not loud at all. There's no audio. Help. A S D F space, bend certain fingers.

43
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:41,939
How do I do, uh, A S D F. Oh, F is okay. This is the surgeon simulator, but you just do regular,

44
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:52,410
like normal stuff. Why is this? So is there any audio? Okay. Bend all fingers, hands mode. Oh,

45
00:07:52,410 --> 00:08:01,560
you switch hands. Space is run. Crouch. Why would there be a crouch? Okay. Right mouse button is

46
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:16,089
rotate. This is just surgeon simulator with two hands. He's going to get bored. All right. So

47
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:27,750
how do I go down? Rotate forearm. But how do you, how do I move my hand just down? Like how do I

48
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:44,580
move it down? Middle mouse button? No. Why am I locked in place? What's wrong with me? Left shift

49
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,559
is hands. Okay. Oh, there we go. All right. So what do I need to do? I need to pick up the fidget

50
00:08:49,559 --> 00:09:04,120
spinner and spin it. Oh, it's the mouse wheel. All right. Shit. This was like funny fucking seven

51
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:11,580
years ago. God damn it. I know. I understand. I know this was funny back in like 2013,

52
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:22,019
but just imagine we're there again. How do I pick this up? What do you mean? No, it wasn't.

53
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,220
If this was not funny in 2013, why did every single person make a YouTube channel about this

54
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:48,039
exact video game? It was bait. Somebody thought it was funny. All right. Pull it up. I did. Wait,

55
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:56,389
I almost got it. How are you supposed to grab stuff? Is this like the part, is this the game?

56
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:11,799
All right. I got it. Did I win? What do I do with it now? I have to make it spin. How do I lock this

57
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:29,669
into place? Spin it. This is like wrist exercises. How do I get it to move forearm, rotate forearm,

58
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:41,429
bend all fingers? Left shift hands mode. Okay. There we go. I see. Pull this down here. How do

59
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:46,950
you even use a fidget spinner? I don't think I've ever used one. This is wacky. You guys wanted

60
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:58,299
wacky? Here it is. It's not quite wacky. This would be music too. Why is it no audio in this whole game?

61
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:15,259
This is tearing, it's not tearing fingers off. Oh shit. This is just, this is like wacky in quotes.

62
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:24,519
I, now I know what you guys are talking about. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I

63
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:32,620
at least have to get one of these done. I bought the fucking game. Play the multiplayer? Well,

64
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:38,600
I can't go into multiplayer until I know how this game, how the game works. All right. Put

65
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:48,490
the whole thing down. This game's $2? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll get it.

66
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:56,409
Is it $2? Dab with the fidget spinner.

67
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,779
I need to, how do you, okay. I need to be able to do this. I need to do this in real life first.

68
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:14,059
How do you pick shit up? I don't even know how, how you, how the person you do this.

69
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,080
Like you grab, like I just grab stuff. I don't like know how I just do it. It's like breathing.

70
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,110
So I need to like pick this up in real life before I can actually know how to do this.

71
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:35,610
You go down and use your thumb, right? What's the thumb? Thumb is space. So if it were me in

72
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:48,379
real life, I would go like this and I would do my thumb and my index finger, right? Yeah. Okay.

73
00:12:49,179 --> 00:13:01,460
This is how you pick stuff up, right? Here we go. Hold on. I almost got it. Get it. Come on,

74
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:13,139
pick it up. That one's too hard to get. I'm going to get this one. So what's the point of the other

75
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:30,600
hand? All right. Go like this. Come on. Okay. I got it. Now how do I, I gotta get it to spin.

76
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,009
What is like a soundtrack? All right, hold on. Let me get it to spin.

77
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:51,879
I can't breathe. I can't breathe. It's so funny. Oh, I fucking dropped it.

78
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:04,889
Fuck. I actually didn't mean to do that. Wait, this one's bigger. Maybe I can pick up a picture

79
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,620
I've already tried. Actually, wait, I probably can do that. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

80
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:19,450
I'm interested now. I wasn't interested until 10 seconds ago. Give me the pencil. How do you pick

81
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:27,740
up a pencil? No, no, no, no, no. Don't drop it. I'm right-handed. I should be using this.

82
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:41,860
You see, he's a fucking wacky Twitch personality. It's too hard to grab stuff. Okay. I got this.

83
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:52,149
Now I have to activate it, right? So let's activate it. What's the hand again? It's this one.

84
00:14:52,789 --> 00:15:10,860
All right. Flick it down, right? Why is this not working? Flick it down. Flick it down. What the

85
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:25,779
fuck am I doing? This looks like it hurts. Is it actually, is it already activated? No, there's no

86
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:39,179
pen coming down. What about the thumb? Let's try the thumb. Space, right? All right, bring it up.

87
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:52,169
Bring it back like this. Grip it. And then, is this pen already activated? Oh, I mean, oh.

88
00:15:52,730 --> 00:16:09,480
Nothing about me. Something about me. I can't, I can't. No, I have to put it like up in my face.

89
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:25,590
I actually kind of like this. So I don't, middle mouse button is look mode. Wait, hold on.

90
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:34,179
Can I freeze individual hands? All right. Click it down. Why is it not clicking it down?

91
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:49,480
Am I stupid? Am I actually out of my mind or am I not doing this right? Both.

92
00:16:49,639 --> 00:17:03,399
Don't, don't fuck come at me. Don't. I don't understand how this works. First of all,

93
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:09,980
this needs to go down. Act like a normal human and just put your hand down. And then this is how

94
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:20,859
I would leave you right on the desk. Okay. Now put this down here. Standard document. How do I

95
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:34,759
write? Wait, hold on. Let it go for a second. Middle mouse is look. All right. So shift hands.

96
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:47,019
So that's it. That is how you freeze. Okay. So if you want to freeze something, you have to hit

97
00:17:47,019 --> 00:18:02,680
shift. So right now I need to, I gotta pick this back up. Just drop it. You're holding it like a

98
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:18,089
syringe. Yeah. Well, how the fuck am I supposed to do it? Is this even possible? Tell me now,

99
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,170
tell me, stop. I don't want to waste my time anymore. Is this possible to pick up the pen

100
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:56,089
and use it? Yes. Are you sure? Grab it. Grab it. Okay. I got it. Now I have to arc my hand up

101
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:14,059
like this. All right. Get it down there. Now, how do I do? Okay. Do I have to click this?

102
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:38,440
I actually have to click this down. You have to write funny. Yeah. But for me to write funny,

103
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,119
I need the pen to work and all these pens, you have to push these buttons down.

104
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:56,599
There's pressure there. Why is it not working? This should be working.

105
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:05,740
Is it ready to go? He doesn't know how to use a pen. This is how you use a pen. I know how to

106
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:13,849
use a pen. Look like this pen sucks. Okay. It needs it. Wait, stay right there.

107
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:53,500
Fuck. I almost got it. Come on. Just click for fuck's sake. Oh, please. I don't want to

108
00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:03,430
just wait. I got to bring this over here closer, like up in my fucking face and put it up. So it's

109
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:14,579
like that. And then up into my face right there. Here we go. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

110
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:32,279
What's wrong with this pen? What is wrong? What's wrong with the pen? Use your palm instead.

111
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:51,769
That's not going to work. Why am I handing the air? What am I doing?

112
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,960
This is going to drive me fucking crazy. You know what? Move this hand over here.

113
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,720
Your hands just move on their own slowly. See how it's like moving to the right.

114
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:16,650
Come here. No, you fucking dumb thing. Move it over here and up right there.

115
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:32,789
Okay. Now I have my index finger. I'm going to tilt this like that. Why is this so hard?

116
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:56,809
Why is this so hard to do? This fucking camera. And then down. And then we do an index finger

117
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:22,680
right here. I'm going to do a different strategy coming through here. This is not how hands work.

118
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:36,950
No, it's not. It's a mess. I'm currently on it. How much pressure needs to go on this thing

119
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:42,460
to fit through the clothes? Why is this thing made out of fucking cement? Why can't I just

120
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:59,900
push it down? It doesn't make any sense. All right. Already angry? Yeah. Because like,

121
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:14,839
what the fuck? It doesn't make any sense. And plus, all right, when I move my hand to the right,

122
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:23,529
it just immediately moves it. Look at this. Where are you going? Where is this hand going?

123
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:35,460
Do I have my controller plugged in moving up? Move to the right. Are you sure you didn't move

124
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:53,460
up to the left? This is a chill stream. It is. Tilt it this way. Like this. Stay right there.

125
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:29,559
Come on. Wait. Somebody help me here and tell me why I can't move these things. All right. You got

126
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:44,279
to tell me why the fuck that ain't moving. It doesn't click. What do you mean it doesn't click?

127
00:25:44,279 --> 00:26:04,359
Sometimes it just doesn't work. Give me the pen. No, give me the fidget spinner. Give me the beer.

128
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:19,690
Give me the, I don't know. Give me something else. Fuck. Why can't I lean this way? Bring the other

129
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:26,859
hand over here. Oh, it's gone. I can't even reach that far. How am I supposed to get this?

130
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,720
My body actually can't go that far. How are you supposed to reach this stuff on this table?

131
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:57,140
Is there like a lean button? C? C doesn't do anything. Can I like move my body? I can't even.

132
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:22,779
Nope. Oh my God. I got it. I got it. I got it. I almost got it. All right. The mouse scroll

133
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:39,980
into clicking and holding. Like that ain't going to work. Let me try. I have to do at least one of

134
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:57,000
these fucking tasks. I don't care how stupid and shitty this is. I almost got it. Come on.

135
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,730
If it spins in the air once, it counts. I don't care. No, wait, hold on. I think I can grab it

136
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:17,430
out of the other with the other hand. Oh no. He doesn't like hand game. Is that, is that really

137
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:33,750
a big deal? If I don't like hand simulator, that can't be a big deal. It's not a big deal.

138
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:51,240
If I don't like hand simulator, just grab it. Get it. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

139
00:28:52,250 --> 00:29:23,579
No, didn't work. Can you even fucking do anything? Are you having fun? No. Ow. Stop. Hey,

140
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:30,099
you know, I got a hernia. You can't make me laugh. I have a hernia now. If I could pick this up,

141
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,299
make him laugh. Make him laugh. All right. I, I almost feel like I want a different control

142
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:57,289
scheme for this. Mouse XY and scroll wheel is move forearm. Using the scroll, I wish I could

143
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:03,769
just make that like right click and move down. In VR, it's a one-to-one movement. I feel like if

144
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,289
you did this in VR, everything would just be really easy. You just pick it up with your hands.

145
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:30,680
You just pick it up. Got it. I don't even know what buttons I'm holding. I don't know what buttons

146
00:30:30,680 --> 00:31:02,519
I'm holding. Spin it. Quiet. That counts. That counts. That counts. I got it. It counts. It counts.

147
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:12,759
See? This would be real sad if you saw somebody doing this. Resident sleeper pog.

148
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:33,690
All right. Beat this one. Let's do another one. That took 30 minutes. Holy shit. Time flies when

149
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:40,359
you fucking hate the game you're playing. All right. How about, uh, let me see if I can fix

150
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:53,700
this though. No. All right. I did it. All right. What's the other ones? Milkmaid. All right. Now

151
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:23,589
we have all of a sudden audio. What is this? Cow? It's a cow. It's a cow. All right. Do I do

152
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:50,859
the other hand? So this one was, this is it. Punch the cow. Band that person. Get that person out

153
00:32:50,859 --> 00:33:15,910
of here. I just had it too. I already did it. I did it. I can do the next one. It slipped. All

154
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:31,960
right. I win. I'm watching this in between classes. I'm milking a cow. This is a fucking cow.

155
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:50,089
All right. I got enough milk. I got enough. I got enough. Uh, what is horror? What the fuck is this?

156
00:33:50,089 --> 00:34:07,220
Okay. You use WASD in this one. How do I control my hands? Am I gonna, am I gonna die?

157
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,340
Okay. That was, that was just, they were just there in the room.

158
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:29,780
Are you, they're slowly walking? Do I have to kill this person? All right. We're gonna use the

159
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:43,739
candle. No we're not. We're gonna use, um, there goes all my light. But why does your hand float

160
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:51,559
back up? I don't understand. When you put your hand down, it just comes back up. Down, up, down,

161
00:34:51,559 --> 00:35:04,250
up. Stay down. That's how hands work. No, if I put my hand down, it's not gonna float up.

162
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:30,389
I'm not on a bunch of drugs. Hurry up. I'm trying. Punch her. I don't think you can punch.

163
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:48,820
All right. I'll try punching her. Come on Moe. What are you crazy?

164
00:35:49,219 --> 00:36:19,900
Oh jeez. This looks like I'm just arguing. Why is she not walking any closer? I'm just like

165
00:36:19,900 --> 00:37:03,900
pointing. Is it working? I think I'm pushing her. Um, is this working? Hold on. Oh, well that one

166
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:21,610
sucks. How about shooting range? Choose a weapon. All right. How about, um, zero? This is gonna be

167
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:42,460
impossible. This will be actually impossible. Maybe not. All right. Stay there. All right.

168
00:37:42,460 --> 00:38:00,820
Keep it right there. Right. Which way does it go in? Like this. Yep. Don't drop it. Don't drop it.

169
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:14,550
Don't drop it. Don't drop it. Come back up. No. Other way. Oh man. This is not gonna work.

170
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:25,800
It has to be probably exact too. No. Pick it back up. It's not gonna work. Pick it back up.

171
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,349
All right. I have to come at this from a completely different angle.

172
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:59,110
Fucking mouse scroll. It like hurts my finger to do this this much. Get it over here. What the

173
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:06,659
fuck? Dude, imagine having mouse scroll be anything other than slide around a menu

174
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:32,780
in any video game ever made. What just happened? I caught it. How did I catch that? All right. I

175
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,780
gotta slow down. All right. That's not, that's not bad. That's not bad. Freeze it there.

176
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh my fucking god damn it. Give me a break.

177
00:39:46,170 --> 00:40:01,510
Do gun second. Not first. Please. Is there a way to rotate my wrist? Like that? Yeah. Do it again.

178
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:31,960
Fucking damn it, man. Why does this have to keep happening? Oh, it's killing me. You know when

179
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:39,449
you're in a really bad fucking dream and you just want to wake up but you can't? You have to fucking

180
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:46,789
pick up the clip. This is a bad, this is not even hand simulator. This is a, this is bad dream.

181
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:53,300
The game. I feel like I'm moving the same way that I move when I'm in a dream.

182
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:07,579
Got it. Now turn this way. Please. What are you doing? All right. Now give me the gun.

183
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:18,440
I'm not even, I'm right handed though. Wait. I'm up this way. Like that. All right. Almost there.

184
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:42,500
Almost there. Don't fucking move. Eat the bullets. Oh my fucking god. Why? This is,

185
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:54,260
you guys remember QWOP? Okay. Imagine if QWOP had 15 more buttons. Now it's upside down.

186
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:22,139
Just read fucking fresh shit again. Stop. Just get it. Play QWOP instead. I know. I know. I

187
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:27,659
feel the same way as you. All right. Can we just be very clear? I feel the exact same way,

188
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:37,780
but I can't, I have to do, I have to do this. I feel identical to your feelings. We are the same

189
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:45,300
right now, but I have to do something. I have to do this. I have to get the guy in the dream.

190
00:42:50,619 --> 00:43:02,949
Don't move that hand. Just play QWOP. No, I'm not going to play QWOP. QWOP. You guys want to talk

191
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:12,340
about old YouTube shit? QWOP is the boomer of these LOL. It's hard to control games.

192
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:25,829
And you guys hate boomers. Don't, huh? I'm getting angry. Don't it's going to fall off the fucking

193
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:37,619
table. No, it's not. I got it. QWOP is a zoomer. No, it's not. It's, it is the boomer of these

194
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:47,619
types of games. Okay. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't

195
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:55,269
let go. What do I do? Don't let go. I have to use, I have to hit the mouse scroll, but I can't,

196
00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:17,380
I can't reach it. No, I have to grab this at a better angle. Fuck. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

197
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:29,400
don't, don't, don't. This is going to be such a miserable experience. All right. Stop. Why does

198
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:39,400
it have to do that? Why does it do that? Why does it do that? You have to hold the thing. And then

199
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:46,250
when you switch, you're holding the wrong stuff. Make sure you spam mouse scroll down to be able

200
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:51,929
to even have your hand. Remember when you put your hand down, you, I've made out of fucking air. Why

201
00:44:51,929 --> 00:45:06,179
would you ever make it that button for any reason? Literally make it, I make it controlled with my

202
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:28,630
tongue. It'd be easy to do. All right. See right now I have to hold all the things that I was

203
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:59,750
currently holding before. All right. Let's try it. It's weight. The weight is going down. Oh,

204
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:24,550
this sucks. This sucks. Get in there, please. I have to beat my nightmare. Oh,

205
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:34,949
oh, my whole body is fucking hurting right now. I hate it, but I can't, I have to have to do it.

206
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:43,980
I hate this. You know, you sit down to write a paper for college or for high school, doesn't

207
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,219
matter. And you, you hate, you, you write one sentence and you just go like, Oh, I fucking hate

208
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:55,500
this. And you like stand up, like move around. You're like, God damn it. I fucking hate this.

209
00:46:56,139 --> 00:47:02,119
Then you know, you have to do it. This is, I feel the same exact way. I have to do this.

210
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:23,000
All right. I might be able to, what if I keep this right here? Tilt wrist down. It's almost there.

211
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:34,780
It's almost there. It's almost there. It's almost there. Look at this shit. Does it actually have

212
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:52,300
to be exact? No, it fucking doesn't. No, it doesn't. Why does it need to be exact? This is

213
00:47:52,300 --> 00:48:04,460
a video game. Nothing's exact. You have to do it with one eye closed. Did somebody even just say

214
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:12,630
that or am I making that up? All right. It's not, it's not in the right place. This needs to be up

215
00:48:12,630 --> 00:49:21,320
like this. Uh, don't, don't. Oh, if I feel like it's, Oh, no, no, just go in there. Get in there.

216
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:35,590
Get the fuck in here. Is it in? No, no, it's not. Dude, this is not hard to do this. This is not

217
00:49:35,590 --> 00:50:05,480
hard to get this in here. Don't force it. It's not fucking possible. It's not possible. This is not

218
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:14,650
is not fucking possible. Where's my hand? Where am I going? What are you doing? What's it doing?

219
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:29,480
I'm not touching anything. You see in this shit. I'm not touching anything. Why is it? What is it

220
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,110
doing? All right. I would like to bring my arm down, please. Let go. You sure you don't want to

221
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:41,929
push it forward? That's not what I wanted you to do. Why are you like phantom moving? This is,

222
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:48,460
I don't know. What the fuck? All right. I'm going to try something else. Put the, put the gun down.

223
00:50:50,550 --> 00:51:04,940
I want to try to get underneath it. Okay. Then down. This is absolutely not going to work.

224
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:26,780
Without a single doubt in my mind. There's no way this works. All right. I have to at least get it

225
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:38,179
in here. Maybe it'll be easier if I go this way. All right. I'm going to try this. It just doesn't

226
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:48,550
go the way it doesn't go where you want it to go. Stay right here. Move forward. Don't fucking move.

227
00:51:49,110 --> 00:52:03,260
You're moving. Why are you moving? You shouldn't be. Which way does it go in? Which way does it go

228
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:33,110
in? Like this? I don't know. Would you like to move left? No, move right. Why is it fighting me to

229
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:40,570
move left? Dude, this shit is fighting me. Move left. No, move this way. Move left. No, you want

230
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,010
to move this way. Move left. No, move that way. What are you doing? Why is it a rubber band?

231
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:53,510
Why the fuck is it a rubber band? I just move here and stop. Move mouse left. Move mouse right.

232
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:57,110
No, what are you doing? You don't want to move mouse right? No, I want you to stay here.

233
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:42,090
It's not. It's not going to work. God. Why is my arm just broken? Why do you have to hold it like

234
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:48,280
this? I have a better idea. I have to hold the gun in a different spot. I have to hold the gun

235
00:53:48,280 --> 00:54:06,730
with two hands. Yeah, fuck this. Give me this thing. Fucking mouse scroll. Imagine having mouse

236
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:11,820
scroll. Imagine it. Just imagine mouse scroll. I just want you to picture it in your head.

237
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:32,699
All right. Move it this way. No, I just want to imagine. Imagine. Oh, God. Pain in the ass.

238
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:53,510
This is great. All right. Now, wait. I just want to tilt it down. Why is it so hard to

239
00:54:53,510 --> 00:55:08,440
even rotate your wrist? It's just all fucked up. No, I ain't going to be able to do that.

240
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:20,380
This guy at the gun range, it's like, no, you're doing that real wrong.

241
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:58,820
You know what? I have a better idea. Am I going the right way? This is painful to watch. This is

242
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:17,260
painful to play. So I agree with you. It sucks. But I have to try. No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

243
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:23,320
This is the opportunity. Why are you naked at a gun range? I don't know. Because I don't know the

244
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:39,139
lore. Okay. Hold on. My initial plan might work pretty well here. My hand needs to go down like

245
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:49,960
that. All right. Everybody hold your breath for a second. Beautiful. Hold it in place. Let go of

246
00:56:49,960 --> 00:57:01,690
this. Oh, fuck. Yeah. All right. Now hold on. Now I just need to put this in the right spot.

247
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:09,940
Up and like over here. Okay. You can breathe now. Yeah. Take a nice deep breath out. And then

248
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:21,750
this needs to be perfectly straight. Just go to the left. If I move to the right, he moves to the

249
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:35,380
right. If I tilt to the left, he moves to the right. What are you doing? Like move your fucking

250
00:57:35,380 --> 00:58:01,190
hand. I hate this game. This is the worst game of the decade. I can't even bend my wrist. It's

251
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:21,739
the weight of the gun. Oh, please. I can't even get the thing to stay straight. Come back over

252
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:36,199
here. Try a grenade. No, I'm not quitting. I'm not quitting yet. Just because you say a game is the

253
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:44,360
worst game of the decade doesn't mean that you're not going to try to win. Give me my other hand.

254
00:58:53,670 --> 00:59:09,909
Wait, that's not a bad spot. Where's the clip? All right. Get it over here. I have to spin this

255
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:23,400
around. You have to throw a grenade. I'm not done yet. I need to move this in a circle with like

256
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:30,650
my thumb. Just don't knock it off the fucking table. All right. So that's going to be going

257
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:48,119
the right way, right? Keep spinning it. Let it go. It needs to go. All right. So shoe out,

258
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:59,219
right? Forward shoe out. Is that correct? Like the toe of the shoe here. It goes out. Tab forward.

259
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:24,860
Right. Okay. All right. Cool. So I have to do spin this. Don't fall off the fucking table, please.

260
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:37,269
All right. Almost there. All right. Tab is almost going to be facing out. Just going to grab it

261
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:44,659
from. I can't, I have to make sure I grab it from the bottom. I got to close all my fingers

262
01:00:45,219 --> 01:01:15,000
completely. And then cause it'll get stuck. All right. Tab is now facing out. Hold on. I

263
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,400
should be able to let it go from here and it won't fall off the table, but it'll be in the

264
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,519
right. Oh my fucking God. Don't fall off the table. Don't fall off the table. Don't do it.

265
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:28,389
Jesus Christ. Oh fuck. Okay. Hold on. This is important.

266
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,989
It's going to fall off the table. It's going to fall. I have to use the gun.

267
01:01:56,170 --> 01:02:14,659
I actually am naked. You're right. That is weird. All right. Wait, flip it again. Now it's almost

268
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:28,920
there. Why can't I just tilt the gun to the left? There's like an invisible wall here where I can't

269
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:55,300
move the gun this way. I can go literally every single other direction. Fuck you. No, not you.

270
01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:17,800
You. Me? No. Yes. Not yes. Not yes. This. Why is my pinky not closed? Oh my, I don't understand why

271
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:25,179
I don't get it. I can go every other direction. The gun is apparently too heavy for me to hold

272
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:39,460
in one hand. Is this the new Mario Tennis? No, because everybody likes Mario Tennis.

273
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:58,579
That's different. That's a different scenario. Except for me. I like Mario Tennis. I don't like,

274
01:03:58,579 --> 01:04:10,119
I don't actually like Mario Tennis. I just have to say that. Again, let me just maybe be very

275
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:18,179
clear about this. Move character's arm to the right. No. Go that way instead. Move character's

276
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:24,119
arm in. No, just go that way. I don't have any actual precise control of my character.

277
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:52,500
Sometimes he just, just bounces. It's over. Zero progress. Point and laugh. Yeah,

278
01:04:53,219 --> 01:05:23,239
I'll give you a laugh. Such a fucking mess. What a mess. I know, look, I know this is what the

279
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:36,440
game's point is. I understand. I know. I know the point of the game is for this scenario. This is

280
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:45,690
what everybody likes and everybody wants to see. It was made for this scenario. This one. This is

281
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:49,210
what you wanted to see. This is what everybody plays this game for. No one wanted to see that.

282
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:56,340
That's right. Fuck, you're right. No one wanted to see this. Shit. Yeah, nobody wanted to see this.

283
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:59,780
Everybody said, don't play this. This game's terrible. And I was like, oh no, I want to do it.

284
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:04,840
Yeah, I get it. You're right. Nevermind. Shit, I was wrong. I'm sorry. I was about to go off

285
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,239
like a tangent about what you wanted to see and nobody wanted to see this.

286
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:20,139
I'm like painting a pretend fucking narrative. This is what you guys said. This is what you guys

287
01:06:20,139 --> 01:06:32,519
wanted. No, no, we didn't. Oh, right. What I meant to say was here's the fucking worst thing though.

288
01:06:32,519 --> 01:07:01,179
I like need to see this. I have to do this. I can't open this and then not do it because then I'll

289
01:07:01,179 --> 01:07:08,059
never live this down, you know? I'll be the one moron that opened this game and went, no,

290
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:12,460
I don't, this is dumb. And then, no, no, no, I have to do it. I have to at least load the gun.

291
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:45,929
I have to load the gun. I have to load the gun. Wait a minute. Will this work? No, I didn't pick

292
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:52,469
it up. Great. Yeah, didn't pick it up. It didn't pick the fucking thing up. And now I'm on a

293
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:57,349
different view. This is fantastic. Oh, good. Do it again. No, no, do it again. No, do it again.

294
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:06,340
Okay, this time. No, you didn't get it. Okay, please. Spam mouse scroll. Now click. Did you get it?

295
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:14,730
No, sorry. Your hand floated four inches up for no reason. Spam mouse scroll. Click. I think I got

296
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:36,550
it. Did I get it? Oh, good. Got it this time. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's almost there.

297
01:08:36,550 --> 01:09:09,560
It's almost there. Stop, stop. Stop. Can I save state? In there, please. How is it not going in?

298
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:21,880
What? Why is it going out? Why? Go in. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

299
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:44,100
Go. Go. Go. Why? It's stuck. No, it's not. Wait, hold on. Move my thumb out of the way, maybe. No,

300
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:59,850
no, no, no, no. Turn the whole thing upside down. Stop. Okay. Turn the whole thing upside down.

301
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:07,960
Fuck. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go with your finger. Let go with your finger. Let go with

302
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:13,319
your finger. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Not yet. Don't. I'm crossing here. Should I let go of

303
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:30,779
my finger? Let go. Okay. Yeah. What did I say? Worst game of the decade? That's fucking harsh.

304
01:10:33,909 --> 01:10:55,270
I got it. Now shoot it. Okay. Wait, wait, this been a bunch of subs that have come in. Okay. I got

305
01:10:55,270 --> 01:11:25,430
it. Now I just have to shoot it. Get my finger in there. Oh, that scared the shit out of me. Okay.

306
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:28,470
That's how you shoot the gun. I shot it. All right. So I shot the gun. I did it.

307
01:11:35,909 --> 01:11:39,029
I have to aim it. I have to hit the target and then I can play a different game. I'm not going

308
01:11:39,029 --> 01:11:46,060
to play a different game. I'm like obsessed. Look, this is the extra stream this week. We already

309
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:52,340
talked about it. This four days in a row. This is the extra stream. This stream didn't even happen

310
01:11:52,340 --> 01:12:13,140
today. You're all imagining things. You're dreaming things. You can't wake up from the dream. All right.

311
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:34,569
Let's go. All right. Now I can move my hands like this. Perfect. All right. The pinkie's got a thing.

312
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:50,069
Okay. Here we go. I'm trying. Okay. Why is it? Why am I dropping it? Why am I dropping it? Does

313
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:56,619
this gun weigh like 70 pounds? What are you doing? What are you doing? What the fuck is it doing?

314
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:46,069
Come here. Oh, don't do it. Don't shoot me. Okay. It can't shoot me now. Oh, it's freaking me out.

315
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:53,939
Don't drop the gun. I need to actually, I can, I can drop the gun over here. I'll try picking it

316
01:13:54,020 --> 01:14:02,460
up one more time. Don't let it go. I'm not going to let it go. What's the next gun? I should try

317
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:06,439
the sniper rifle. There's no way I'm going to be able to do that without a single doubt in hell.

318
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:39,539
Jesus Christ. I have to at least get a shot fired over here. I'm trying. Don't drop the gun.

319
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:52,649
It's aiming at my stomach now. This is not good. Ooh, tilt.

320
01:14:53,529 --> 01:15:07,420
I'm not gonna. I have to just put it back over here. Oh, it's in a bad spot.

321
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:13,829
I don't like this game. I really don't. It's like, it's seriously causing me a ton of anxiety right

322
01:15:13,829 --> 01:15:43,020
now, but I can't stop. All right. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just give me the damn thing.

323
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:49,779
Chill stream. Oh, beg a lull. Whatever. I can hold it upside down. The gun still works upside down.

324
01:15:50,500 --> 01:16:17,159
Pick it up. Grab it. Half-life Alex game play.

325
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:38,739
All right. Just aim it. Did I get one? All right. I shot him. Okay. I got it. Yep. Right over there.

326
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:58,010
I got two. One, two. Okay. Cool. What's the next thing? Why can I not use the, what do I mean?

327
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:12,119
I can't. Why can I spawn the other gun? You have to unlock the next one. You need points

328
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,989
to unlock the next one. I'm going to do this real quick.

329
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:26,069
Shit. Okay. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. No, no, no, don't do it! No! No!

330
01:17:26,069 --> 01:17:29,750
Just hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on everybody. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

331
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:49,779
But whatever. This is not even a real stream. Fuck. Just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it, re-do it.

332
01:17:49,779 --> 01:18:05,960
I just realized this streamer is only in 720p. Oh no. What a disaster. I can't believe he's in

333
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:20,090
720p that sucks that's fucked up yeah 720 60 you guys know anything about bitrate

334
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:28,140
if you do a 1080 stream at like four five six thousand k up unless you're at 30 fps

335
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:41,979
that looks like shit when you don't know anything about bitrates you guys want 1080p for this game

336
01:18:41,979 --> 01:18:52,630
that's even sadder the human eye can't see past 30 fps but that's not that's bullshit because

337
01:18:52,630 --> 01:19:05,460
human eye can see rainbows so i'm just gonna crush that right there put this down all right
