00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:12,630
Hey, how you doing everybody? Welcome to another day. I streamed yesterday but I had to

2
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,989
kind of take a little short there. Cut it a little short because I wasn't feeling well and I have a

3
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:25,769
cough. It's a deep cough. It's inside my body. Like it would be coming from somewhere else.

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,570
Outside. It's an outside cough. It hasn't gotten better. It's actually gotten a little worse.

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,210
And that's the unfortunate thing. I woke up this morning. I was a little slow.

6
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:50,119
I'm a little fatigued. But I don't give a shit because Sekiro came up. I've been waiting for

7
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,240
this game for a long time. So I don't care how bad I'm going to be coughing. I'm going to be mutant.

8
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:03,509
I'm playing this fucking game now because come on. What am I going to do? I'll wait like a few days.

9
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:17,989
No, no, no. Yeah, there's mucus but it's fine. The Drake no, no, no face.

10
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:27,340
But yeah, we're going to start Sekiro. I'm going in completely blind like we did Dark Souls 3.

11
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,769
We'll see how we do. I've heard it's a lot different. I've heard that the game

12
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:43,379
should not be played even remotely like a Dark Souls game. It emphasizes blocking and parries,

13
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:55,000
not dodge rolling. So I'm looking forward to this. Early boy. Yeah, we're a little, we are.

14
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,980
And I wasn't feeling great and I didn't want to just see, let it progress even more over the

15
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:13,189
next three or four hours. I took some DayQuil. Go back to bed. No, I'm staying right here.

16
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,569
It's Christmas morning for somebody that likes the game company from Software. Christmas only

17
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:28,469
comes once every four years with this company. When was Dark Souls 3? 2015, 2016, 17, 18, 19.

18
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:49,210
So Christmas comes once every three years. Thanks for the early stream. Yeah. How long

19
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,590
do you think I'm going to be streaming today? I don't know. It really depends on a couple of

20
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:03,210
factors. It depends on first of all how physically do I feel and if I get stuck on the tutorial boss

21
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,030
for the first like four hours. I don't know. I've been playing it since release and it might be

22
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:18,810
too hard. That's what I keep hearing. I keep hearing the game is too hard. I'm, I can't wait.

23
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:34,729
Your immune system is compromised because you're a vegan. Uh, I had a chicken sandwich last night

24
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:46,409
just for the record, you know. And there it is. God, I'm so excited for this. I wish I felt better.

25
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,810
I wish I physically didn't feel so fucking awful, but it doesn't matter. Everything's going to be

26
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,650
fine. I'm going to get the video game placebo effect and I'm going to start feeling way better

27
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:06,620
in about 10 seconds. This is Sekiro. Shadows die twice. Not like you haven't seen this intro

28
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:15,780
like 50 times. I'm one of like 16,000 people streaming this game right now. I was actually

29
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,060
going to type, we're talking to the pre-stream chat. I was going to title this stream in all

30
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,779
capitals. Please click mine. Don't scroll down. Click mine. I played Dark Souls. I actually played

31
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:39,129
Dark Souls. It's going to be in all caps. I actually changed. I went in here and I changed.

32
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,850
I'm curious as to how this is going to play out because for two reasons, right? I got an Xbox One

33
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:52,819
controller plugged in and I don't like the bumpers on the Xbox controller. So what I did is I changed

34
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:59,740
attack to right trigger and prosthetic tool to right bumper and guard to left trigger. I wonder

35
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:11,370
if that's going to be bad or not. I'm actually considering making attack X. I'm thinking about

36
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:23,050
you can use PS4 controllers. Yeah, but I heard there was issues with it.

37
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:27,689
And the button prompts screw me up too because the button prompts don't change to PS4.

38
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,139
Yeah, we'll try. I'm just going to play like this and see how it is. If I need to change it,

39
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:41,639
I'll change it, right? I'm stalling. I know that that top right. Did you see that auto save top

40
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,550
right thing? It's been so long since I've seen that. Set it to English. Yeah, it's on English

41
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:57,819
already. All right, here we go. It's been so long since I've played a software, a piece of software

42
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:08,170
developed by From Software. Blood on, subtitles on, HUD. This is all fine. This audio I think is at a

43
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:17,500
decent level. Software from From Software, yes. The game is meant to be played in Japanese.

44
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,300
We'll just go back and forth. Every like five minutes I'll switch it.

45
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,220
All right, cutscene. Here comes the opening cutscene.

46
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:44,279
In the closing years of the Sengoku era, Japan was consumed by perpetual conflict.

47
00:06:44,279 --> 00:07:06,779
Takes place in Japan. The fires of war raged on, spreading deep.

48
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:32,069
Oh, nice shot. Was that bad or good? It has a germa hair. I gotta get comfortable.

49
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:41,079
This game is supposed to be the hardest game ever made. What is the hardest game?

50
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,519
Oh my god, shut up. No, no, not you, me.

51
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:09,370
We did it. Master swordsman Isshin Ashina staged a bloody coup and wrested control of the land.

52
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:40,860
What the what? What's the matter, stray? Nothing left to lose. Well, don't grab it by that.

53
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't you understand? You gotta hand somebody a pair of scissors the other way and hand them

54
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,149
handle side, not blade side. From the battlefield, betraying relentlessly.

55
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,950
It's like kindergarten safety 101. Went on to become a master shinobi.

56
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:13,940
Was never for the shinobi. As your father, my master is as of today.

57
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:22,919
Defend him with your life. If he's taken, bring him back.

58
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:41,289
I'm sweating right now. I really am. I'm disgusting. I don't know if that's because

59
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,450
I might have a fever. I don't know. I'm going to say it's because I'm really excited for

60
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:53,399
Sekiro. Shadow's done twice. After Isshin's coup, the Ashina clan was on the brink of collapse.

61
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:04,490
And the shinobi, known as Wolf, had lost everything. Both the man who took him in

62
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:17,929
and the boy he had sworn to protect. Is that engine? Is that from? So I haven't seen any

63
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:23,350
gameplay. I've been pretty good about keeping away from it. I've seen like maybe I saw I think I saw

64
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,830
like the original teaser trailer, but not any. Hey, there's 10 straight minutes of gameplay.

65
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,309
This could be a strategy game or a puzzle game and I wouldn't even know.

66
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:58,549
Shinobi. Every minute is at least as hard as pinwheel. Good luck. Okay. That's good to know.

67
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:19,110
Thanks for the tip. Nice. All right. Here we go. Let's begin. Let's check the movement first.

68
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:37,820
That's really important. Is that the? Oh, it's the dodge roll. Nice. Yeah, everyone said the game was

69
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:48,009
way harder, but the funny thing is, is this is like, this is 400 dodge frames. Is it? Where's the

70
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:55,580
dodge? All right. No, don't miss anything. Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to pay close attention.

71
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:03,480
Portamental letter. A letter thrown into a well. Kuro's wolf. Your destiny awaits you at the moon

72
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,120
view tower. Escape from the well and find the tower bathed in moonlight. Moonlit greatsword

73
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,080
will be at the base. Even without a blade, you can reach it, stay silent, stay vigilant.

74
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:28,950
So escape the well. Okay. First that you can swim in this game. I didn't just fall straight through

75
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:41,320
into the, out of the map. Interesting. Uh, that's new. So I could go this way or that way. Can I

76
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:56,980
dive? I wonder if there's a dive button. What's over here? I got to turn the lights off in my room.

77
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:09,129
That's important. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm in the menu now. Hold on. Now it's, it's one, it's one

78
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:16,740
third in the afternoon, but the lights are coming off. This game has actual menus, apparently. There

79
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,019
we go. Now I can see a little better. The equipment menu allows you to change your currently equipped

80
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:28,730
quick items. There are five slots available to equip and switch out quick items as needed, right?

81
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,690
Okay. So it's just like Dark Souls. You have this, these are your inventory slots or equipment slots.

82
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,549
Interesting. All right. Unseen aid, vitality, attack power. We only got, we only got two stats

83
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:49,320
in this whole game. Vitality and attack power. Items currently in possession can be viewed

84
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:56,580
through the inventory menu. Okay. So this is my items. There's the idle. Let's see. I'm going to

85
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:06,309
read. Okay. Let's see. No, no, no. Don't touch that. A small palm-sized wooden Buddha can be

86
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:12,149
used repeatedly held by the wolf. Ever since he was saved by his father, its corners are rounded

87
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:17,350
with use. This Buddha is used to return home. It will return the user to the last visited sculptor's

88
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:25,179
idol or dilapidated temple. And I can use this as many times as I want. So this is a homeward bone

89
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:44,230
with an infinite value. Really unlimited bone. Yeah. Okay. All right. So, um, am I missing

90
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:58,360
something over here? Did you wall jump? No, nothing here. Maybe there's something like over here

91
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:06,019
eventually. Is this just like Mario 64? It was made by the, uh, I think the same exact developer

92
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:14,700
from Nintendo. I was, I know that was not funny, but you know, look, I'm sick today.

93
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,450
That is really cool though. And you keep just having a jump in general that I don't have to

94
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:31,080
be sprinting and then press like the left thumbstick in. What? Okay. Yeah. Well, that's

95
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:39,690
jump in air near to do a wall jump. Don't even tell me that you can even feel like Spider-Man

96
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:48,889
in this game. No. I mean, yeah, kind of. Oh, I just want to go so slow. If I'm sorry, if you thought

97
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:52,090
this is going to be like a fast playthrough of a guy like, yeah, let me just get to like the first

98
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:59,029
boss now. No, no, no. I just, I want to look at everything. I want to experience the game very

99
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:08,389
slowly. What if I just died? Thank God there's no fall damage. Otherwise that would have been death

100
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:20,659
number one. I need a weapon. Also another thing that I need to change. I need to change the,

101
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:26,120
no, maybe not. I'll get used to it. All right. We can go backwards or we can go.

102
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,950
All right. I got to like relax. I haven't even played the game yet. Let's go this way first.

103
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:48,090
No. Holy shit. Tug wall. You toggle it. Okay. I can go the other way. This is a shimmy.

104
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:57,370
You can peek around a corner. All right. Well, there's an enemy right there.

105
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:09,240
Stealth. Stealth. Advance without being seen by crouching in bushes or moving under floors.

106
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:16,009
You do not have a sword at the moment. You stealth to avoid enemies and head to the moon view tower.

107
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:22,170
You are about to be seen. Warning markers appear above enemy's heads. Oh man. This is a stealth

108
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:43,220
game. So, okay. Crouch. Well, you can see me. I'm in a bush. Okay. Let's just keep going.

109
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:51,670
Let's hang off the ledge. This feels like I shouldn't be able to do this.

110
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:15,670
Drop down. No, that's gonna kill me. Just let's go through the corn. Underfloor. Wolf can slip

111
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:27,529
into tight spaces such as beneath floors when crouched. You can go beneath floors. Like under

112
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:34,039
there. Okay. But what if I'm missing items? There's probably like an item I can go get over here.

113
00:18:34,039 --> 00:19:05,220
Did I just do it? Oh, let me see. Because that's... Is there something else I can do?

114
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:12,539
No, I mean that's clearly going under the floor, but is there anything else I can do?

115
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:20,980
There's so many hidden fucking things in this game. No, I'm just gonna go.

116
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:49,319
I tried to do the infinite eye frame dodge. Died in the... Well, I'm just... I'm so conservative

117
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:56,339
of missing something. I'm just gonna go. Yeah, I'm just gonna go. Look, there's like an item over

118
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:08,359
there. I might go back. Am I never... Wait, am I never gonna be able to come back here again? Are

119
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:26,490
you sure? I figure this might have been a different way to go, but maybe not. There's nothing here.

120
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:54,150
All right, that's... I'm gonna call that strike one. The check is three strikes today. That was one

121
00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:06,730
guy. No, I'm just gonna go. I'm just so happy that I get to play this right now. Under tight spaces.

122
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:17,740
That death doesn't count. All right, I got the eave drop there. Spider webs. Let's just go. So,

123
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:25,140
I'm assuming that's the tower, right? How much can I move without actually being seen, I wonder?

124
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:45,400
It's yellow and then it turns red, right? What about over here? No. Let's listen. Hole in the wall.

125
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:59,190
I mean, really. But you're not Sekiro. I'm Sekiro. I can do it easily. All right, so now...

126
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,859
Well, they got two... Oh, they face... Can I go down here? Can I just drop down there? I mean,

127
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:27,980
obviously, I have to go down there. I wonder how sensitive their hearing is. That's beautiful.

128
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:38,490
Oh, imagine living there. Jeremy never played a video game in his life. Elbertson. No, I just

129
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,490
don't know. In some stealth games, it's very sensitive. Their hearing or how close you get.

130
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,380
All right, I can jump this. I would have been very embarrassed if I died right there.

131
00:22:51,740 --> 00:23:10,119
Uh, jump and in the air to ledge hang. Jump ledge hang. Is there a sprint? Okay, hold on.

132
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:14,809
There's a hole in the wall up here. Oh, there it is. Nothing else. What about a guy up there?

133
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:32,630
I don't see nothing. What about down here? No items. Oh, what does that mean? Not sturdy?

134
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:43,140
There's the hole facing the cliff. All right, I think we found our first character of the game.

135
00:23:43,779 --> 00:24:04,950
Is this gonna alert enemies or something? No. First boss. Hey, no spoilers. That's strike two.

136
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:37,750
Even if it's incorrect. He just fucking flops me. Oh, that's a sword. Okay, I thought it was a pipe.

137
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:47,960
My shinobi, in accordance with the bond of lord and retainer,

138
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:57,779
you will I hereby welcome you to Sakura. Thanks for dying in the tutorial. But I was exploring

139
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:12,920
the controls. That doesn't count. As you command. The Kusa Bimaru, a katana given by Kuro, the divine

140
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:23,079
heir and heirloom of the Hirata family. A cadet branch descended from Ashino. Once thought lost,

141
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,920
it has found its way back into the hands of the wolf. The name Kusa Bimaru beseeches a shinobi's

142
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,759
role is to kill, but even a shinobi must not forget mercy. A mantra of the blade itself may manifest.

143
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:45,980
All right, weapon. All right, so this is the hub world. This is where I level up with my souls.

144
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,420
Loyal wolf, I see you are wounded. I have something that may help. Do you get it?

145
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:05,190
Okay, healing gourd. A gourd filled with vitality restoring medicine. Restoring, resting refills

146
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:11,990
the gourd. Okay. Made by an apprentice of the extraordinary Dr. Dogen. Though it is strange

147
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:16,630
that the gourd's medicinal waters refill automatically. The seeds within may hold the

148
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,269
secret to how it works. I could turn my mouse upside down because it's gonna keep doing that.

149
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:27,380
I'm gonna like put it on my desk and like upside down. Okay, so I have a estus kind of.

150
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,130
I'm not gonna change the audio to Spanish.

151
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,569
We got an escort mission.

152
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:56,170
I ask you to find that secret passage. Once you find it, signal me with a read whistle.

153
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:00,809
You got one of those? Like you used to long ago. I will join you as soon as I hear it.

154
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,150
All right, healing, using quick. You can cycle through various quick items to

155
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,630
and use each according to the situation, right? If you've taken damage, you can recover vitality

156
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,349
with the healing gourd. So use quick item and then cycle. Wait, so the use item is now up.

157
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:35,269
Oh, okay. I gotta actually put it on here though. Oh boy. I gotta change that. Yeah,

158
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:44,730
that's gonna screw with me the whole game. Let's go into binding here. So let's see.

159
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:57,430
Action is, this is action. There's a lot of, okay, use item. X is Y bound to anything?

160
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,099
Cycle prosthetic tool. Shit. I might have to get used to that.

161
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:12,230
Because drinking like the Estes is always that face button, whether it's square or X to me.

162
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,859
Somebody said rebind Y to up. Because that's a cycle prosthetic tool that's probably better

163
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:35,109
than Y, I would think. Use item, I'm going to say X and then action and collect loot, I'm going to

164
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:52,740
do Y. Because I will never ever get used to that. My muscle memory, my brain has different bindings

165
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,180
because of it. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Hitting X to heal is

166
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,700
something I will never be able to not do. So then Y is now my interaction button, which that's fine.

167
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:12,650
That's getting the car in GTA, right? That's interact. I can do that. There's a secret passage

168
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:17,690
beneath the moat bridge that can take us out of the castle. Find the secret passage beneath the

169
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,609
moat bridge so that we may escape Ashina Castle. When you've reached it, give the signal. I'll come

170
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,210
as soon as I hear a good whistle. So let's, how do I refill the gourd?

171
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:39,750
Didn't tell me that one. Smartass. All right, let's go upstairs. Nice physics. Look at that. Item.

172
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:46,490
Pellet. Medicinal pellets that slowly restore vitality. A secret treatment passed down for

173
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,650
generations in these lands. Records say it has been used in battle since times long gone

174
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:58,009
and lent to the famed resilience of Ashina warriors. A pill case full of these pellets would also serve

175
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:09,769
as a battle charm. Oops, I just broke it. Okay. One pellet. Is this a chest? Let me look at that

176
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:31,450
again. So pellet. Slowly restore vitality. Vitality is a stat. Huh. Okay. So, but vitality is not

177
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:49,029
health. No, it is health. Okay. All right. Okay. I'm thinking too hard about it. Well, I'm just

178
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:55,210
basing every, all my knowledge on from software. I thought maybe it was something to help with,

179
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:05,980
like a status effect or something. All right, let's go. And here we go. I just, I just opened

180
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,509
up the gates to Yharnam. Posture and death blows. A shinobi aims to break an opponent's posture.

181
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:18,940
Attacking an enemy is one way to achieve this. When an enemy's posture breaks, he is vulnerable

182
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,910
to a shinobi death blow. So right trigger is, I mapped it to that. Right trigger after breaking

183
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:31,190
posture is a death blow. So that's kind of like a, a, like a parry into a death blow or a

184
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:38,759
visceral attack would be more towards Bloodborne, I would say. So breaking an opponent's posture.

185
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:46,680
Here we go. First enemy. Is there a two-handed or is it, is it only one-handed? How does this work?

186
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:57,029
Let's see what happens. Do I have a dodge? Okay. Oh, I got two people at the same time. Let's just,

187
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:16,089
let's go. Let's go. Oh yeah. That's posture, right? Okay. Oh, I see. That's a different bar.

188
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:30,539
It's a separate bar underneath the health. Whoa. All right. Well, uh, okay. So there's two,

189
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:33,980
there's a health bar and then a posture bar. Does stamina exist anymore?

190
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:55,160
Wait a minute. There's no stamina. Holy shit. That changes everything. Let me go take, uh,

191
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:11,049
nothing else over there, right? Wow. All right. That's so cool. Oh my God. Yes. All right. Let's

192
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:20,140
go. Come here. Wait. Sometimes relentless attack is not enough to break an enemy's posture.

193
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:26,220
Deflecting enemy attacks is another way to damage their posture. A master shinobi uses

194
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,059
a combination of deflect and attack to achieve swift victory. Left trigger the moment an attack

195
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:39,779
lands is deflect. Let's give it a try. Let me see what it looks like. Okay.

196
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:48,950
There it is. So then you go immediately into it. So it's not as much a parry as it is. Okay.

197
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:59,660
I get it. So you get to treat it as a, that actually, that feels really good actually.

198
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:08,969
That feels fucking great. I'm not going to lie. All right. Two guys that way. Let's go up here.

199
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:22,360
Anything hidden? No, that's just where I came from. I guess I think I have to go that way.

200
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,340
Lock on. Yeah. By locking on targets. Yeah. While locked in, you can change with, uh, R.

201
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,420
It's much easier to attack and deflect and perform other combat actions with people that are in

202
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:45,369
front of you. All right. I guess I'm just going to go in that door. Let's see if I can get some

203
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:55,050
perfect lock ons here. Perfect parries. That's so what is that? I got one of those bars too.

204
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:13,500
Perfect lock on. So I, this is on PC. PC with an Xbox one controller. Is there a sprint?

205
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:39,460
One. Oh, you can instantly kill people. You just insta kill. Oh, where is he? This is leader,

206
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:47,159
leader. What? This is a boss already? A counter slash can be performed immediately after

207
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:51,079
deflecting. Yeah. That's what I was doing. This allows you to deal posture damage without giving

208
00:35:51,079 --> 00:36:14,010
the enemy time to recover. Counter slash. So it is just sword play, huh? Let's see if I can.

209
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:31,980
He's got a big long swing. So that's his posture up there. Some powerful opponents require multiple

210
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,460
death blows to be killed. The number of death blows required to kill an enemy is shown by the

211
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:46,199
red circular markers above their vitality bar. So you got to do a death blow to kill bosses. You got

212
00:36:46,199 --> 00:37:18,579
it. Ooh, that hurt. Watch my posture. That hurt. Back it up, back it up, back it up. I don't want

213
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:37,559
to break. Whoa. My posture just got increased by a shit load right there. So if I hold down block,

214
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:53,880
my posture goes back to normal. Okay. Whoa. Oh, he's going to break my posture. Shit. Okay.

215
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:13,480
Who's going to break first? You. Oh no. Oh no. He's almost broken. Oh, don't treat it like Dark

216
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:46,949
Souls. Oh no. Wow. That's a, that's different. That's very different. So, all right. If your

217
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:59,099
posture breaks, then you can die, but you could break their posture as well. All right. I'm,

218
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:17,860
I'm starting to understand how this works. Well, I'm already right there. Is there stagger? I want

219
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:32,250
to help pick up a stagger. But I don't lose posture when I attack. Okay. There is a stagger.

220
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,559
All right. I see. I kick because you can do that little block at any time. I'm, I'm using it as,

221
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,230
I got to remove the Dark Souls from my brain because a parry in Dark Souls takes a few seconds.

222
00:39:46,230 --> 00:40:17,880
You know what I mean? Do it again. Am I dead? What? I'm going down again. Okay. I'm starting

223
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:26,679
to figure out what I'm doing here. So once he gets to that red area, you got to hit him

224
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:34,840
another couple of times. So here's another pellet. Okay. Interesting, interesting, interesting stuff.

225
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:47,820
I'm not going to heal yet. Wait, what else is over here? You're going to say that 20 times an hour

226
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,460
for the next three days. You know, it's, I'm starting to figure it out. You know,

227
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,739
we've got first boss done. You know, I'm starting to figure it out. Interesting. The mechanics are

228
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:02,940
pretty cool. I'm just starting to figure out like kind of how that works. Three bosses down.

229
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:11,480
Cool mechanic, but I, I'm not sure I completely understand it yet. It's very fun though. 45

230
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,789
minutes from completing the game. Yeah. I think I'm really comfortable getting comfortable now,

231
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:28,199
maybe on a second play through. I feel like I can do something here. No, it's yeah. You're,

232
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:35,690
it's offense and defense at the same time, which is something that you're not used to. Ash gripped

233
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:43,690
into a hardened clump, throw it at an enemy to temporarily distract them. The snow falls thick

234
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:51,639
and thus the hearth runs thick with ash. So you can throw dust in somebody's eyes. All right.

235
00:41:51,639 --> 00:42:07,500
Unless we got here this down. Should I go in? Oops. What about the doors that were just over here?

236
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:18,440
Let me go in the doors. Can I open this or can it not be opened? Like, oh, it doesn't. Here we go.

237
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:27,510
Cannot open from this side. You know what that means. That means fall down here and

238
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:34,789
no, it doesn't. I almost did that. You almost just left. All right. I'm going to go up there

239
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:44,980
actually under the bridge, right? That's the bridge. Let's see what's over this way.

240
00:42:46,840 --> 00:43:02,230
Should I be still thing in air near wall, wall jump, and then hang on ledge? Yeah. What's that?

241
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:23,639
Oh, I can each run with it. It's guarded now. What's that thing? What is this little weirdo

242
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:37,400
that's just sitting here digging? Uh, this is an, it's an enemy. What do I do about this?

243
00:43:38,119 --> 00:44:02,170
What the fuck? Okay. Near edge. Um, who was that? I don't know who that person even was

244
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:21,019
or why they were here. It's the egg. Is this going to kill me? Oh, an item. Look. Oh, look at that.

245
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:32,219
What is it? Pellets. I should probably put these on the heart bar and the ash here too. So pellets

246
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:42,250
heal. All right. Oh, you got more rocks. Let me just take a gander across the way and make sure

247
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:51,480
I didn't miss anything. I mean this shit over there, but fuck it. Let's just go the way we're

248
00:44:51,480 --> 00:45:08,300
going. Uh, any enemies? There's going to be something down here, right? Like right here.

249
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:24,039
No. What is this? Nothing. This appears to be at the escape route called the divine air with the

250
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:27,000
no, I found it. Okay. Hold on. No, no, no, no, not yet. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

251
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,199
Is there something else I can grab or do? Is this death? If I fall down this?

252
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:55,849
Hold on. You can't grab that. All right. Well, can I, hopefully I can grab this again. I need,

253
00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:08,440
I need to know. Oh, it's not water. What the fuck is that? Okay. It's just a lizard.

254
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:16,389
Oh my God. That wasn't even, I don't even know if that was hostile.

255
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:33,690
I don't even know if that enemy was hostile. I'm sorry. I'm coughing. Anything else?

256
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:44,409
Yeah. I don't think I, I don't, I don't need to be doing that, but I'm going to, I don't want to just

257
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:49,260
blow through that part. Let me look up here. I feel like it's probably another pellet or something.

258
00:46:50,940 --> 00:47:19,159
Maybe, maybe not. No, no, I can go here. Nothing else, right? No, not really. Just want to look.

259
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:44,809
No, I think we're good. I think we're good to go. Nothing else over here. That much of a fall might

260
00:47:44,809 --> 00:48:01,050
kill you though. Still in the canyon. Oh, I'm taking my sweet ass time. You better believe it.

261
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:15,139
Although I might have to go all the way around again. Yeah. Well, at least I got to see the

262
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:28,179
lizard, right? You're supposed to ride the geckos. I don't know if I believe that, but

263
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:44,039
jumping around is really fun though. Here leads us to this ledge, which can I make a jump from here?

264
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,400
Oh my God. What just happened? All right. Well, that's, that's actually a really good thing

265
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,039
because I was almost just drinking that Estus because I pressed, my brain was pressing X.

266
00:48:55,289 --> 00:49:12,710
Instead of Y. Okay, let's go. I should be able to get them from here. That looks good. Although,

267
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:30,789
what about over there? Oh shit, hold on. I think I, a shit load of money just came in.

268
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:38,329
We just gave 50 fucking dollars. Let me see what was. Oh, my mouse is up here, right?

269
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:50,230
Ow. Uh, Katz Beanie, thanks for 50 bucks. Thank you so much, Katz Beanie. 5000 bits.

270
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:54,420
There's a lot I would like to say to you, Jerm, but I just keep it, Jerma short.

271
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:58,500
I love your VR streams and your Dark Souls streams. I'm always happy to watch you stream

272
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:06,630
and thank you for being yourself. Uh, that's, that's really fucking kind of you. If you like

273
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,150
the Dark Souls streams, then you probably like this one too, because this is by the same company.

274
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:16,659
Thank you for your extreme generosity. You have 50 dollars. It means a lot.

275
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:34,940
Much love to you. Thanks for sticking around. 5000 bits. There's nothing I can do here. That

276
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:56,889
was Katz Beanie, by the way. All right. Blow the whistle. Are we in E mode only? What's going on

277
00:50:56,889 --> 00:51:02,360
with chat today? Is it because it's Sekiro? People just lose their minds over a game like this?

278
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:19,460
You found it. Now, let us leave this place. Yes, my lord. To think that this is the only way

279
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:29,539
to run from the faded bloodline is the answer. No, is, are we in escort quest?

280
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,880
Escort quest territory. Get the mouse off the screen. There we go. All right.

281
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,239
Run away.

282
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,239
I didn't even mean to do that. I'm sorry.

283
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,170
All right. If I walked back out there, it was like jumping up on walls again. Hey,

284
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:10,820
let me just check the verticality of the game. See how it is. All right. That looks cool.

285
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:38,699
Where's the note that says welcome? Get good, right? Last we stood together was your uncle's

286
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:57,349
funeral. Lord Genichiro. Genichiro. I'll just hand the sword. Hey, you take this. You try.

287
00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:18,860
It's like we have two lives. You can't beat him. I'll give it a go. Oh boy. One v one.

288
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,719
Is it going to have a huge boss bar underneath at the bottom? I hope so.

289
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,320
Uh, not necessarily. Oh God. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn't heal

290
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:43,050
yet. I didn't heal. I need to heal first. All right. Let's do it. So let's tap, tap.

291
00:53:45,909 --> 00:54:05,739
What the hell was that? That little like, what the fuck does that mean? I am so confused.

292
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:24,539
I gotta back up. What the fuck? Why am I getting like a Batman indicator?

293
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:39,340
What the? Oh, I think, oh, that's supposed to happen.

294
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:55,829
That's how you become Sekiro. He turns and he says to the kid, it should have been you.

295
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:08,460
Is that all the Shinobi? The divine air will be coming with me. You were supposed to go first.

296
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:21,880
I would have seen the Batman indicators and then I would have fucking ran.

297
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:39,719
We're about to see, this is the E3 teaser. I thought he was doing that to his leg.

298
00:55:40,199 --> 00:56:06,300
Oh, pale blood, you say? No matter. Just think it all and be a bad dream.

299
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:33,800
Don't mind the beeps. I'm just going to mute. Looks like death is not your fate just yet.

300
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:55,269
All right. The Shinobi prosthetic, the artificial arm of a Shinobi passed down by the sculptor,

301
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:59,190
a replica of a human arm fitted with a variety of mechanisms,

302
00:56:59,269 --> 00:57:02,869
apparently designed with a modification in mind, with modification in mind.

303
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:07,530
Well, if there is a number of cuts and is stained thick with blood and oil,

304
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:13,380
it has been impeccably maintained. Interesting. Okay.

305
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:24,949
What do you call yourself? The eyes of a wolf who has failed in his duties.

306
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,510
Or so it seems to me. That is not your concern.

307
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:34,250
Spoken like a true Shinobi. This dude is huge.

308
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,400
Dialogue options of how you got here. Ask about your new arm. How'd you get here?

309
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,719
What am I here? All I did was drag you here.

310
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:55,420
Didn't even know if I was dragging a corpse. Go get eaten, vile dogs.

311
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:02,460
When was I asleep? Some time has passed since I found you.

312
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,500
I see. However, your master,

313
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:11,019
yet lives. He's being held prisoner in Ashina Castle.

314
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:14,699
They will soon make use of his bloodline. I wonder if this is the hub.

315
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:19,099
Looking at you, I'm sure you appreciate the value it has.

316
00:58:20,219 --> 00:58:25,699
Okay. Ask about your bloodline. What did you mean when you said they'll

317
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:29,860
make use of his bloodline? I don't know much about him,

318
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:36,179
except the dragon's heritage. There's a special kind of blood by that name,

319
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,179
and that blood runs through your master's veins.

320
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:43,380
Of the Divine Heir? Someone's after him.

321
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,219
Might be that the strange things happening to your body

322
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:51,539
have something to do with that. All right.

323
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:55,400
Might as well ask. What did you do to me?

324
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:01,400
That is what I call the Shinobi Prosthetic. A fitting fang for a one-armed wolf.

325
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,199
You're getting to where I have where I reached. Gonna beat the game myself.

326
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:09,159
See you later, Teramo. See you later, Pat. Enjoy the game.

327
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:14,170
It seems really fucking cool.

328
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:18,789
Any Shinobi tools. Shinobi tools.

329
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:24,710
I see this device. You catch on quick.

330
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,829
So this is kind of like a blacksmith. If you give me Shinobi tools,

331
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:35,800
I'll find a way to Shinobi Prosthetic. I appreciate its worth.

332
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:44,840
I've said too much. Go now. You're quite the strange one.

333
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,880
Huge amount of money just came in again.

334
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,880
Other peculiar visitors have come to this temple.

335
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,880
Oh, let me just get to the end of the sequence.

336
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,880
There's one in the clearing to the right of the gate,

337
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,880
leading off the temple grounds.

338
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,880
Two strangers in strange circumstances.

339
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,880
To the right of the gate, okay.

340
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,659
You too might get alarmed.

341
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:06,280
All right, so I got the Shinobi Prosthetic.

342
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,519
Hold on one sec.

343
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:10,519
I don't know why this keeps doing this.

344
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:12,519
There we go. That's better.

345
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:18,619
Juno Upsetto gave $50.

346
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:21,050
Thank you so much Juno Upsetto.

347
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:28,380
Two very, very large monetary contributions back to back here within 10 minutes.

348
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,380
So, that's a fucking lot. Thanks guys.

349
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:37,190
Juno, you say, you say, I've been under the weather recently.

350
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:39,190
Guess it couldn't help to spread a bit of positivity.

351
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,820
Love you guys. Jerma Heart.

352
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,820
Hell yeah, thank you. Sorry you're not feeling well.

353
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,820
Neither am I.

354
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,820
Unfortunately, I don't know why it seems whenever I get sick

355
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:50,539
or you guys get sick, I get sick too. It's weird.

356
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:53,929
But, welcome to the hub world.

357
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:55,929
This is probably what this is.

358
01:00:55,929 --> 01:00:57,929
I'd be surprised if it wasn't.

359
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:00,619
On Sculptor's Idol.

360
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:06,570
Commune. Commune with Sculptor's Idol.

361
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:10,570
Sculptor's Idol serve as a checkpoint and can be found throughout the area.

362
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,829
It's like a bonfire.

363
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:15,829
Completely replenish vitality and restore one's

364
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:17,829
one use of resurrection.

365
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:23,159
One use of, additionally quick items and spirit emblems in storage

366
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,059
would be added to your current inventory.

367
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:28,059
With some exceptions, resting will also revive defeated enemies.

368
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:32,519
Uh, okay.

369
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:34,519
So, I get, I get, I get, I get.

370
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:37,139
Resurrection. Unseen aid.

371
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:44,119
30%.

372
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:48,139
My, my god.

373
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:50,139
Shadows die twice. Yeah, that makes sense.

374
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:53,780
Uh, um, what, what have you done?

375
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,780
Die, die 335.

376
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,780
That's 225.

377
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:06,820
That is an uncountable amount of damage.

378
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:09,539
That is an uncountable amount of money.

379
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:11,539
Thank you for the 225 bucks.

380
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:15,539
They say, don't know what to say, but here, laughing my ass off, take it.

381
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,460
Okay.

382
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:26,090
I guess I'll take it.

383
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,780
That's a fucking ridiculous amount of money, die.

384
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,079
Thank you.

385
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:33,260
Holy shit.

386
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,260
Streamer can't count to 225.

387
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,260
Well, I can, but that's uncountable.

388
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:43,510
Another NPC coming in here.

389
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,690
Jesus.

390
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:49,690
No, it isn't. It's uncountable.

391
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:56,909
But thank you, die.

392
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:58,909
My god.

393
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:00,909
That's fucking insane.

394
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,420
Okay, so what does she do?

395
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:17,139
Oh.

396
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:28,719
You got any more of them?

397
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:35,150
Is it weird that anytime somebody says that I'm a doctor, I don't believe them.

398
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:38,420
I just got, trust me, I'm a doctored.

399
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,420
The medicinal waters in this gourd spring forth on their own.

400
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:57,420
Even after being emptied, you will find it full again after a short rest.

401
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,420
Yes.

402
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,420
Is there a way to improve it?

403
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,420
Bring me gourd seeds.

404
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,420
Gourd seeds?

405
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,420
Yes, medicinal waters grow from gourd seeds.

406
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:12,420
Adding new seeds will increase the volume of these medicinal waters.

407
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,420
If you find any, bring them to me.

408
01:04:15,139 --> 01:04:17,889
Alright.

409
01:04:17,889 --> 01:04:19,889
Okay, do I have one?

410
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:23,860
Oh, I don't have any.

411
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,860
Hold on, what else do you got?

412
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,420
I'm glad you've come. I'd like to make a request.

413
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,659
Request?

414
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:32,659
Please show me your face.

415
01:04:32,659 --> 01:04:36,820
What?

416
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,820
This white mark.

417
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,820
Is it a birthmark?

418
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,820
No.

419
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,820
That's a correct reaction.

420
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,820
What?

421
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:53,840
I have to show my face again.

422
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,019
Okay, anything else?

423
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,860
Receive the dragon's heritage.

424
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:17,340
Hmm.

425
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,340
Hmm.

426
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,389
Oh, yes.

427
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:29,380
Okay, just making sure there's nothing else?

428
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,559
Yes, right. That don't do anything funny.

429
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,559
Yeah, I won't.

430
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:40,300
Alright, so we've got our place of rest right here.

431
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,300
And then we can go this way, or we can go that way.

432
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,300
Now, the question is, which way is correct?

433
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,400
Grappling hook.

434
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,400
The shinobi prosthetic grappling hook allows access to normally unreachable places and a chance to take the high ground.

435
01:05:57,449 --> 01:06:01,449
Nearby grapple points are designated with a circular symbol.

436
01:06:01,449 --> 01:06:04,449
When this symbol turns green, the grapple point is within reach.

437
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:10,780
And I've got a left bumper.

438
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,780
That's so cool. Hold on.

439
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:17,650
Let's just take a look.

440
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:29,920
Might as well try it.

441
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,920
Well, that's awesome. Can I do it?

442
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,349
Does it have to have an indicator there, or can I just do it whenever?

443
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:36,349
I guess I can just do it.

444
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:38,349
Okay, this is Ashina Outskirts.

445
01:06:38,349 --> 01:06:45,820
I wonder if this is where I need to be.

446
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,820
Maybe.

447
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:53,219
Sculptor's Idol travel.

448
01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:57,219
You can now instantly travel between Sculptor's Idols that have already been communed with.

449
01:06:57,219 --> 01:07:00,650
Travel can be accessed via the Sculptor's Idol travel menu.

450
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:06,860
So, any of them.

451
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,860
So, okay, that's good.

452
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,860
This goes to important places.

453
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,159
So this is the, yeah, Outskirts.

454
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:16,590
There's the dilapidated temple.

455
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:19,590
This is the temple, and the Outskirts is really all I have.

456
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:22,829
I love how important places is here.

457
01:07:22,829 --> 01:07:24,829
Alright, so we've got a bonfire.

458
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,670
Let us...let's just go.

459
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:35,889
Can I grapple that?

460
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:40,820
What about down there?

461
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:42,820
Can I make that? If I jump and grapple, am I gonna die?

462
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:45,940
I need to test.

463
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:51,250
Should I test it?

464
01:07:51,250 --> 01:08:02,059
No, you can't! You can't, Spider-Man!

465
01:08:02,059 --> 01:08:11,409
It was worth a try.

466
01:08:11,409 --> 01:08:13,710
I didn't die, though, somehow.

467
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,710
There's definitely something I can do over there.

468
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,710
But, for the sake of progress, let's just see what happens.

469
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:22,260
Go this way.

470
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,260
Uh, I can go to the building here.

471
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,819
This is too much freedom!

472
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:30,079
Oh, I could just go that way.

473
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,079
What about this guy?

474
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:34,079
Stealth deathblow.

475
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:36,079
You can perform stealth deathblows on opponents unaware of your presence.

476
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:40,939
So you can Batman people.

477
01:08:40,939 --> 01:08:44,939
So the plunging deathblow is one of these performed when leaping at an unaware enemy from the high ground.

478
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:46,939
So you jump and then swing.

479
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:48,939
Once you are locked on.

480
01:08:48,939 --> 01:08:50,939
Let's try it.

481
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:56,770
Awesome.

482
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:59,069
And then there's loot. Enemies drop loot such as items and money.

483
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:01,069
Multiple enemies can be looted at once.

484
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:03,069
Really.

485
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:05,569
And from a distance away.

486
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:07,569
Items found in the world are different than loot in that they must be approached to be picked up.

487
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:09,569
Press and hold Y to acquire loot.

488
01:09:09,569 --> 01:09:11,569
Press Y near world item to pick up.

489
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:13,569
So there's just like a money grabber.

490
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:16,899
Interesting.

491
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:18,899
Some pellets.

492
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:22,909
And you can only have three of these, alright?

493
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,149
Alright, what about down here?

494
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:28,859
Let's go...

495
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:31,550
Nothing.

496
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,550
I'm gonna go across that bridge, though.

497
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:38,659
Can I make that jump?

498
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:40,659
Come on. I can grab that from here.

499
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:42,659
Really?

500
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:50,529
Come on.

501
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:54,560
You can go up, down, around.

502
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,560
One could get lost simply just doing basic tasks right now.

503
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:07,380
Ceramic shard.

504
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,510
A piece of pottery that breaks with a satisfying crack.

505
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,510
Throw it at an enemy to draw their attention.

506
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:14,510
I feel like for the stealth portion of this game, some of this stuff is gonna be fairly important.

507
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:19,439
And why would they give that to me right now?

508
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:21,439
Okay.

509
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,319
I was gonna say.

510
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:26,319
Wait a minute.

511
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,319
Can I just do this?

512
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:30,819
Can I just do this?

513
01:10:30,819 --> 01:10:38,350
Fuck.

514
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,350
I'm trying to jump down.

515
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:42,720
You know what I was trying to do.

516
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,279
He jumped backwards.

517
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:50,140
What a pro.

518
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,960
Alright, let's go.

519
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:59,810
Fuck this, man.

520
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:01,810
Just go up here and drop down on somebody.

521
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:12,819
Whoa!

522
01:11:12,819 --> 01:11:17,680
You are just flurrying right now.

523
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,920
I wanna get that guy from jumping down.

524
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,920
Wait. Grab the items. Very important.

525
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,609
It's a huge jump when you jump off of one of those ledges.

526
01:11:24,609 --> 01:11:26,609
You launch.

527
01:11:26,609 --> 01:11:30,380
You launch.

528
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,880
Let's get this guy.

529
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:41,899
So this is a currency.

530
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:44,460
Odd.

531
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,460
There is some sort of currency thing.

532
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:53,100
What?

533
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:57,579
Okay. I thought I was gonna fall.

534
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,819
Alright.

535
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:01,819
Oh my god, guys.

536
01:12:01,819 --> 01:12:03,819
Oh my god.

537
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:09,729
This is so much money.

538
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:11,729
Oh fuck, there's a guy right here.

539
01:12:11,729 --> 01:12:15,380
Can I stealth kill him?

540
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:19,149
Can anybody see this?

541
01:12:19,149 --> 01:12:21,630
No. Alright, hold on.

542
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,630
GuyDude

543
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,630
GuyDudeSM

544
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:28,189
or GuyDudesm

545
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:30,560
just gave a $250

546
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,560
on top of the $225

547
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,859
that Dai gave earlier.

548
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:37,680
Oh my god, guys.

549
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,680
Thank you, Guy. GuyDude.

550
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,680
Hey there. Not much to say. Just want to donate to probably the only streamer

551
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,680
or YouTuber I watch nowadays.

552
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,680
Thanks for being a big inspiration.

553
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,460
UWU.

554
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,460
I don't even know how much money that was.

555
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,460
It's uncountable. Anything over $225?

556
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:56,909
But holy shit, guys. Seriously.

557
01:12:56,909 --> 01:12:58,909
Thank you, GuyDude, for the $250 fucking dollars.

558
01:12:58,909 --> 01:13:02,880
What an insane amount of money

559
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,880
to receive in one second.

560
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,079
My goodness.

561
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:13,819
Hold on.

562
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:15,819
I only have $225 fingers.

563
01:13:15,819 --> 01:13:17,819
Alright, what about this guy? Is that a...

564
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:20,750
What if I just surprise this dude?

565
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:24,399
Ready? Watch this.

566
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:32,529
Oh, he has a gun.

567
01:13:32,529 --> 01:13:35,539
Bullets and...

568
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:37,539
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's here?

569
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:39,970
AshGryptant? Yeah, I know what that is.

570
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,970
I can deflect bullets,

571
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:43,970
but more importantly...

572
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:55,340
That was actually kind of scary.

573
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,739
There's an item over here that I missed.

574
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:01,039
So how do you deflect a bullet?

575
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:08,399
Ungo Sugar.

576
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:10,399
Sugar candy made in Sun Phao temple.

577
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:12,399
Sustaining Ungo's blessing.

578
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:14,399
Temporarily reduces vitality damage

579
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,399
taken from physical attacks.

580
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:18,399
Bite the candy

581
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:20,399
and take the Ungo stance

582
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,399
to impart its inhuman benediction.

583
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:26,699
By doing so, you endure the excess karma

584
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:28,699
of man from the spirits within.

585
01:14:28,699 --> 01:14:30,699
They spread this candy across Ashina

586
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:32,699
so it's like a defense candy.

587
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:34,699
I wonder how long it lasts for.

588
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:41,359
I've got so many items.

589
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:43,729
I wanted to take a look up here.

590
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:49,869
Let's get up there.

591
01:14:49,869 --> 01:14:53,710
And up this way.

592
01:14:53,710 --> 01:15:01,069
You can just climb on houses.

593
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:03,069
Ah, I see an item.

594
01:15:03,069 --> 01:15:05,439
Item that I missed over here.

595
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:12,930
More sugar.

596
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:19,060
Cool, alright, let's go.

597
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,810
You can, Spider-Man.

598
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:23,810
You just have to be close enough.

599
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:34,109
Oops, that's not death, right?

600
01:15:34,109 --> 01:15:41,220
No, it's not.

601
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:44,739
Can I get up there?

602
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:50,430
Is there anything on top of this house?

603
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:52,430
Don't fall.

604
01:15:52,430 --> 01:16:00,100
That's not another

605
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,100
50 plus dollar donation, right?

606
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:05,170
There's not much else I can do up here.

607
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,170
It is.

608
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,729
The Reno just gave 50 dollars too.

609
01:16:09,729 --> 01:16:11,729
I'm going to stop playing because I'm a bad gamer

610
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:13,729
and was starting to rage.

611
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:15,729
Can't wait to watch this happen to you.

612
01:16:15,729 --> 01:16:17,729
Anyway, I'm enjoying the stream thus far.

613
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:21,250
Good luck. Thank you so much, Reno.

614
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,250
I am ready to

615
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,250
get absolutely fucking shit on.

616
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:28,960
But I'm taking my time.

617
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,960
I don't want to just blow through it.

618
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,260
I really appreciate

619
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:38,579
the 50 dollars

620
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:40,579
on top of all the other money that has come in.

621
01:16:40,579 --> 01:16:43,649
You guys are too much.

622
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:45,649
Alright, dog. This is a soul staple.

623
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:53,260
Now I'm going to deal with the dog.

624
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,260
Let's deal with the dog like this.

625
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,890
Oh fuck.

626
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:00,189
He's dead?

627
01:17:00,189 --> 01:17:04,529
Oh shit.

628
01:17:04,529 --> 01:17:06,529
The dog

629
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:08,529
I killed the dog in one hit.

630
01:17:08,529 --> 01:17:22,270
Is that a checkpoint?

631
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:27,819
Wow.

632
01:17:27,819 --> 01:17:30,060
Alright, cool.

633
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:35,039
Dog down.

634
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:37,039
Why can I grab that? I'm getting the checkpoint first.

635
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:39,539
Bonfire found.

636
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:45,939
Sculptor's idol found.

637
01:17:45,939 --> 01:17:51,060
Crest.

638
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:53,060
Travel.

639
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,060
Can you travel to every single one?

640
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,060
Yeah, you can.

641
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:03,520
So this is the gate path.

642
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,590
Let's get the idol.

643
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:08,590
Another ceramic shard. Who's this?

644
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:11,020
It's a dog.

645
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,020
Oh right, right, right.

646
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,020
I respawned the enemies.

647
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,020
Oh shit.

648
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,020
I'm forgetting the most important mechanic

649
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,020
in any of these games?

650
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,390
Really?

651
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:25,390
Of all the things to screw up.

652
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:27,390
Oh my god.

653
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:33,020
What an idiot.

654
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:43,579
Hmm. Let me think.

655
01:18:43,579 --> 01:18:45,579
Name two things that happen in every

656
01:18:45,579 --> 01:18:48,079
souls game.

657
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:50,079
You die and enemies respawn.

658
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:55,779
Oh. I'm not going to make that mistake again.

659
01:18:55,779 --> 01:19:05,569
Dogs can't even get up here.

660
01:19:05,569 --> 01:19:15,300
Who cares? Who's this?

661
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,300
Uhhhh.

662
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:21,260
A mechanical device made by

663
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,260
the mechanical genius Dogen.

664
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,260
Can be fit into the shinobi prosthetic

665
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,260
to become a working tool.

666
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:30,079
I know exactly what I'm doing.

667
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:32,079
As well as palm sides, a surprising number of

668
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:34,079
shuriken can fit into the shuriken wheel.

669
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:36,079
As the edges were designed for stacking,

670
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:38,079
find example of what can be achieved

671
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:40,079
when one matches mechanical finesse with a shinobi's

672
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:42,079
talent. So I got a

673
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,180
part. They can't be used on their own

674
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:48,180
by giving them to the sculptor. They can be

675
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,180
fitted into the prosthetic. You can quickly return

676
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,180
to the sculptor via travel from a sculptor's idol

677
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,180
or use the homeward bone.

678
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,100
Interesting.

679
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,470
Let's just go put it in now.

680
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,470
I feel like I need to do that now. I have an upgrade

681
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:03,470
mechanic. Might as well

682
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:10,189
use it.

683
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:12,369
Get up there.

684
01:20:12,369 --> 01:20:14,369
Get up on top. Thank you.

685
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:23,899
Fucking consumerism.

686
01:20:23,899 --> 01:20:31,119
What?

687
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,960
I got something for you. Fucking consumerism.

688
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,960
I don't even know where that came from. Why did I

689
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,960
read that?

690
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,960
I don't know why I read that.

691
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:13,899
Seems you know this prosthetic

692
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:15,899
very well.

693
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:17,899
It used to be mine.

694
01:21:19,899 --> 01:21:21,899
The more demonic my sculptures

695
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:23,899
will become, give it here.

696
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:25,899
I'll fit that tool

697
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:32,180
for you.

698
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:35,250
Fit new tool.

699
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,250
There's a little menu here.

700
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:40,260
Regular shinobi tools found in the world

701
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,260
can be specifically adapted to the shinobi

702
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,260
prosthetic with the fit prosthetic

703
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:48,420
tool.

704
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,909
So loaded

705
01:21:50,909 --> 01:21:53,220
shuriken.

706
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:56,020
Polish

707
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,020
costs spirit embers.

708
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:01,600
Spirit embers?

709
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,739
Pull a shuriken loaded into the wheel

710
01:22:04,739 --> 01:22:06,739
and launch at a target in a single flowing

711
01:22:06,739 --> 01:22:08,739
motion. The swiftly thrown shuriken

712
01:22:08,739 --> 01:22:10,739
damages enemy vitality and posture.

713
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:12,739
Particularly against those with a tendency

714
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:14,739
to take to the air.

715
01:22:14,739 --> 01:22:23,500
Alright. Loaded shuriken.

716
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:29,710
Okay. So is

717
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,710
that on there?

718
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:44,079
Another fifty bucks.

719
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:46,510
Fifty dollars from

720
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,510
Koopa Troopa.

721
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:53,500
Hey Jerma, I thought this was the right time to donate

722
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,500
to. You have offered me and my brother so much

723
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
entertainment. I thought it was time to give back.

724
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,500
Thanks for everything and enjoy the game.

725
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,770
Thank you so much for the fifty

726
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:10,770
dollars. Happy you

727
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,770
and your brother can enjoy

728
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:14,770
the streams and videos and stuff. Thank you so much.

729
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,010
Seriously.

730
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:22,060
Big money today. I know. Apparently.

731
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:26,159
Prosthetic tool. Prosthetic tools

732
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,159
are shinobi tools adapted for use. There should be prosthetics.

733
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,399
I have a shuriken now.

734
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:32,399
So equipment menu and then using

735
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:34,399
them is spirit emblems.

736
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:38,880
So a prosthetic tool is right bumper.

737
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:44,939
Let's see here.

738
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:47,380
So I have prosthetic

739
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,380
tool slots. There are three slots available.

740
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,510
On the equipment selection

741
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:54,510
screen the controls can be viewed through Y.

742
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:58,529
Okay.

743
01:23:58,529 --> 01:24:01,020
So I have the loaded shuriken

744
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,020
and that's all I can do now.

745
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,649
So that should be right bumper

746
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:07,649
is how to use this.

747
01:24:07,649 --> 01:24:10,699
What is this?

748
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:12,699
You see the kind-faced Buddha there?

749
01:24:12,699 --> 01:24:15,760
That isn't one of mine.

750
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,760
It was carved by the true

751
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,760
sculptor. The true sculptor.

752
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,760
A man must confront what is inside

753
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,760
of him. It can probably

754
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,760
be of help. Confront what

755
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,760
is inside him? Anger.

756
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,760
Sadness. Or perhaps

757
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,760
old memories of times

758
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:37,569
long gone.

759
01:24:37,569 --> 01:24:40,899
I wonder if we can do something with this.

760
01:24:40,899 --> 01:24:43,649
Spiral. So now

761
01:24:43,649 --> 01:24:45,649
I guess it's time

762
01:24:45,649 --> 01:24:49,229
spirit emblems

763
01:24:49,229 --> 01:24:51,229
are required

764
01:24:51,229 --> 01:24:53,229
to activate prosthetic tools and are consumed

765
01:24:53,229 --> 01:24:55,229
each time these abilities are used.

766
01:24:55,229 --> 01:24:57,470
They can be obtained from defeated

767
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:59,470
enemies in the world and purchased from

768
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,470
sculptor's idols.

769
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:03,470
If you pass near them they will find their way to you.

770
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:05,970
Interesting.

771
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:16,020
I wonder if this is

772
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,020
Derma's crying right now. What?

773
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:23,840
So you can only use this twice.

774
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:31,699
Before you have to redo it.

775
01:25:31,699 --> 01:25:34,579
Interesting. Purchase spirit

776
01:25:34,579 --> 01:25:36,939
emblems.

777
01:25:36,939 --> 01:25:38,939
Two out of fifteen.

778
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:40,939
How much do they cost? Ten bucks?

779
01:25:40,939 --> 01:25:46,619
What? Shit.

780
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:53,729
I don't even know how this works. I wonder if I should

781
01:25:53,729 --> 01:25:58,720
buy a couple of these?

782
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,109
Not yet. Prayer bead.

783
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:04,109
What is the unseen aid?

784
01:26:04,109 --> 01:26:06,109
Thirty percent. I have no idea

785
01:26:06,109 --> 01:26:10,020
what it means. Let's just keep going. I've got no idea

786
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:15,520
what's going on. I just got

787
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,520
two thousand dollars. Don't be so stingy.

788
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,579
Oh yeah. That's just fucking

789
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:30,380
consumerism. Wait.

790
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:32,819
I can get up there. Oops. Oops.

791
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:34,819
Oops. Oops.

792
01:26:34,819 --> 01:26:36,819
No. No. Can't stay

793
01:26:36,819 --> 01:26:38,819
up there.

794
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:40,819
I just Mario jumped on his head.

795
01:26:40,819 --> 01:26:42,819
No. Go up here.

796
01:26:42,819 --> 01:26:48,109
Alright. We're fine.

797
01:26:48,109 --> 01:26:50,109
Fucking consumerism.

798
01:26:50,109 --> 01:27:01,039
They'll forget about me in a second.

799
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:04,239
Can I grab that?

800
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,239
They don't know I'm here, right?

801
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:11,550
Is there like an aggro range or something?

802
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:14,619
There's a giant

803
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:16,619
turkey. What? Why? Wait. Hold on a minute.

804
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:18,619
There's an enemy chickens?

805
01:27:18,619 --> 01:27:20,619
Giant chickens?

806
01:27:20,619 --> 01:27:25,359
No.

807
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:27,359
Why are there huge chickens?

808
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:29,359
And why did I

809
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:31,359
just murder it for no reason?

810
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:37,359
That's

811
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:39,359
so dumb. I love it.

812
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,180
Alright. We're just circling back around.

813
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:45,250
That's the best enemy

814
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:47,250
in any Souls game, I think.

815
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:49,250
Personally speaking here.

816
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:54,500
I'm so glad there are giant chickens.

817
01:27:54,500 --> 01:28:03,819
Look at that. Let's go over there.

818
01:28:03,819 --> 01:28:05,819
This isn't a Souls game. I know. I know. I know. I know.

819
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:08,449
Alright.

820
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,449
Guy right there. That is a

821
01:28:10,449 --> 01:28:12,449
super bad guy. So I need to be

822
01:28:12,449 --> 01:28:14,750
prepared. So let's go like

823
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:20,640
this. Let's wrap around.

824
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,199
Does he see me? Can he see

825
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,760
me? There's an item over here.

826
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,859
Watch out for that super bad guy.

827
01:28:29,859 --> 01:28:32,029
Okay. Still hidden.

828
01:28:32,029 --> 01:28:37,600
It's full of ash.

829
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,600
Oh. He sees me.

830
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,350
Alright. This is the first time we're going to get to see this.

831
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,350
Some enemies use unguardable

832
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:46,350
perilous attacks,

833
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:48,350
signified with a danger symbol.

834
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:51,939
When these occur, watch carefully

835
01:28:51,939 --> 01:28:53,939
and try to respond properly as each

836
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:55,939
type requires a specific response.

837
01:28:55,939 --> 01:29:03,619
As thrust

838
01:29:03,619 --> 01:29:07,069
deflect,

839
01:29:07,069 --> 01:29:09,069
jump, or

840
01:29:09,069 --> 01:29:14,319
a grab.

841
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:16,319
What do they mean by sweep? So sweeping

842
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:18,319
attack. I'm assuming from left to right.

843
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,319
Thrust is straightforward.

844
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:22,319
Grab is a grab. Okay.

845
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:24,319
Let me just take him and figure this out.

846
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:26,319
Sweep is jump.

847
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,619
Like that?

848
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:30,619
That's what that means, right? Let me see.

849
01:29:30,619 --> 01:29:34,720
Oops-a-daisy.

850
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:37,729
Alright. I get it.

851
01:29:37,729 --> 01:29:43,039
That's sweep.

852
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:51,489
What the hell does

853
01:29:51,489 --> 01:29:54,369
that mean though?

854
01:29:54,369 --> 01:30:02,109
So you can interrupt it though too.

855
01:30:02,109 --> 01:30:05,250
I think.

856
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:08,699
What about my... Should I use my

857
01:30:08,699 --> 01:30:24,260
weapon thing?

858
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:31,359
Let's see. Don't even let him do it.

859
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:34,819
Don't even let him do it. Oh shit.

860
01:30:34,819 --> 01:30:38,210
Oh fuck. No, no, no, no.

861
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:40,210
Okay. That symbol right there fucked me

862
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:51,010
up. Jesus.

863
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:53,010
Safety roll.

864
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:55,010
Alright. So I thought I had...

865
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:57,699
To stay down after being...

866
01:30:57,699 --> 01:30:59,699
To stay down after being knocked to the ground

867
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,699
surely means death. Safety roll can be used to quickly

868
01:31:01,699 --> 01:31:03,699
recover from being knocked down or posture

869
01:31:03,699 --> 01:31:06,510
broken.

870
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,510
A will be a safety roll.

871
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:34,859
So what it was...

872
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:36,859
I'm trying to remember the controls for that.

873
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:40,579
Oh wow.

874
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:42,579
That was a fucking weird move.

875
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:46,029
Oh shit. I'm in trouble.

876
01:31:46,029 --> 01:31:48,720
I'm dead. What the hell was that?

877
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:55,180
He did this little like...

878
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,180
He did a little tiny kick.

879
01:31:57,180 --> 01:32:06,510
Wait.

880
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:08,510
Die or resurrect? Why do I have...

881
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:12,779
What?

882
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:14,779
Hold on. Why do I have a fucking arcade

883
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,779
continue screen? Should I come back?

884
01:32:16,779 --> 01:32:21,500
Resurrect.

885
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,500
I get to die two times. That's the title of the game.

886
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,979
What?

887
01:32:27,979 --> 01:32:29,979
The Divine Heir's Blood grants the ability to return

888
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:31,979
from the dead using Resurrective Power.

889
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:35,250
One charge is always

890
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,250
restored by resting at a Sculptor's

891
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:39,250
Idol, killing enemies restoring

892
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,420
additional charges.

893
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:43,420
Resurrection becomes unusable immediately

894
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:45,420
after using it for killing enemies will make it available

895
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:50,220
again. Alright.

896
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,659
So when you kill

897
01:32:52,659 --> 01:32:54,659
people you get to charge your

898
01:32:54,659 --> 01:32:56,659
comeback to life bar.

899
01:32:56,659 --> 01:33:00,689
Shadows die twice.

900
01:33:00,689 --> 01:33:02,689
If sometimes. If they've killed enough people.

901
01:33:02,689 --> 01:33:05,060
Okay. Let's go.

902
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:07,619
That's a different move.

903
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:09,619
Oh my god. I'm gonna die again. Do I get...

904
01:33:09,619 --> 01:33:11,619
Do shadows refill my health thing?

905
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:35,659
That's a grab.

906
01:33:35,659 --> 01:33:37,659
Right. Okay. Grab is different.

907
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:43,489
Holy shit.

908
01:33:43,489 --> 01:33:51,619
Back it up. Jesus Christ!

909
01:33:51,619 --> 01:33:54,239
I'm almost out of posture.

910
01:33:54,239 --> 01:34:04,340
I had it too.

911
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:06,340
I'm dead. I'm dead. Safety roll. Safety roll.

912
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:21,699
Oh fuck man!

913
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:23,699
When he swings that... You gotta...

914
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:27,840
Fuck!

915
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,840
So you don't want to take that many hits.

916
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:36,109
I gotta get back to my full posture

917
01:34:36,109 --> 01:34:42,319
again.

918
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:44,319
Oh fuck. I'm dead.

919
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:52,829
Oh boy.

920
01:34:52,829 --> 01:34:55,260
Shadows die

921
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:58,720
thrice. Alright.

922
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:04,739
Let's see what happens here. Experience

923
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:06,739
toward the next skill point

924
01:35:06,739 --> 01:35:08,739
and current Sen in hand are

925
01:35:08,739 --> 01:35:11,100
halved upon death.

926
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:14,500
Sends them money. Everything lost is

927
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,739
gone for good.

928
01:35:16,739 --> 01:35:18,739
There are no known means to escape this

929
01:35:18,739 --> 01:35:20,739
loss. However, through the grace of the gods

930
01:35:20,739 --> 01:35:22,739
or Buddha it may not be impossible.

931
01:35:22,739 --> 01:35:29,310
So wait a minute.

932
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:31,550
When you die

933
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:34,050
you lose half of everything.

934
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:36,050
And there is no go back and pick up

935
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:41,229
your money.

936
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:48,850
Oh shit. Really?

937
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:50,850
Wow. 44!

938
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,850
Oh!

939
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:54,850
No!

940
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:57,149
You lose forever!

941
01:35:57,149 --> 01:36:02,960
Give me...

942
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,960
Just don't die. Apparently

943
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,960
I have no more pellets. Alright.

944
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,289
Let's get back over there.

945
01:36:10,289 --> 01:36:12,979
Now that I've...

946
01:36:12,979 --> 01:36:16,369
Scripted. Scripted death.

947
01:36:16,369 --> 01:36:18,369
Is the chicken back? Just don't aggro the chicken.

948
01:36:18,369 --> 01:36:21,180
Let's do this again.

949
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,180
Wait a second. Alright. Shadows only die

950
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:25,359
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Get up there.

951
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:27,359
No. Nevermind. Let's go. Let's go. Fuck it. I'm ready.

952
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:52,050
Watch that

953
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:54,050
fucking sword.

954
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:57,630
Who broke?

955
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:59,630
Me or him? Oh come on. What?

956
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:01,869
He's so close.

957
01:37:01,869 --> 01:37:08,779
Let's go.

958
01:37:08,779 --> 01:37:38,399
Ugh.

959
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:44,989
Fuck me. You're not doing that. Break him!

960
01:37:44,989 --> 01:37:46,989
Break him! Alright. See you later.

961
01:37:46,989 --> 01:37:54,739
A loose prayer bead. Offering

962
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:56,739
four of them in a sculptor's idol will increase

963
01:37:56,739 --> 01:37:58,739
maximum vitality and posture.

964
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:01,420
Apparently the wolf has

965
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:03,420
one bead. Oh. That's leveling up.

966
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:07,390
Gotta see.

967
01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:12,960
Do you reckon he practices these noises

968
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,960
in front of the bathroom mirror?

969
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,699
Like what?

970
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:22,510
So a seed from the healing waters

971
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:24,510
give to Emma to increase the maximum

972
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:26,510
uses of the healing board.

973
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:29,630
Right. There it is.

974
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:31,630
I hope you can't

975
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:34,770
lose these, right? I would

976
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:37,710
hope not. It would be pretty bad if you could.

977
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:42,260
But anyways, let's take a look

978
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:46,670
up here. Make sure I don't miss anything.

979
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:52,560
Doesn't look like I missed anything.

980
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,250
Yes I did. Shadows

981
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:57,250
check both ways.

982
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,250
AKA twice before crossing the street.

983
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:11,260
The pellet though. Alright.

984
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:14,260
Well, that guy's not gonna respawn.

985
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:16,260
He's like a super enemy. I'm gonna go back.

986
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:25,539
Good one, somebody said.

987
01:39:25,539 --> 01:39:30,079
I actually left. See? Good.

988
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:32,579
The enhanced physical attributes option

989
01:39:32,579 --> 01:39:34,579
has been unlocked in the sculptor's idol menu.

990
01:39:34,579 --> 01:39:36,579
You can spend four prayer

991
01:39:36,579 --> 01:39:38,579
beads to create a prayer necklace

992
01:39:38,579 --> 01:39:40,579
which will permanently increase

993
01:39:40,579 --> 01:39:42,579
your vitality and posture.

994
01:39:42,579 --> 01:39:46,670
I need four.

995
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:49,300
Well, let's just go get

996
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:53,140
our gourd

997
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:59,600
upgraded.

998
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,270
So, what do those bar...

999
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:07,979
What does the thing in the lower left?

1000
01:40:07,979 --> 01:40:09,979
See that pizza pie with the hat

1001
01:40:09,979 --> 01:40:11,979
with the pizza slice taken out of it?

1002
01:40:11,979 --> 01:40:13,979
What is that timer?

1003
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:25,359
It's your resurrection pizza, okay.

1004
01:40:37,649 --> 01:41:01,949
Of course.

1005
01:41:01,949 --> 01:41:03,949
It's a FromSoftware game, of course.

1006
01:41:03,949 --> 01:41:05,949
If they give you the option to just die,

1007
01:41:05,949 --> 01:41:07,949
there's some reason why you shouldn't resurrect.

1008
01:41:07,949 --> 01:41:16,130
Right? Okay, here.

1009
01:41:22,029 --> 01:41:24,029
If you could just resurrect,

1010
01:41:24,029 --> 01:41:26,029
there wouldn't be a

1011
01:41:26,029 --> 01:41:28,029
like, battlefield-style

1012
01:41:28,029 --> 01:41:31,810
just die button.

1013
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:54,449
Okay, cool.

1014
01:41:54,449 --> 01:41:56,449
So, I have a question.

1015
01:41:56,449 --> 01:41:58,449
So, when you die,

1016
01:41:58,449 --> 01:42:00,449
right, does it matter

1017
01:42:00,449 --> 01:42:02,449
if you resurrect or not, do you still

1018
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,449
lose half of all your shit no matter

1019
01:42:04,449 --> 01:42:06,449
what, or does the resurrection

1020
01:42:06,449 --> 01:42:08,449
stop the halving

1021
01:42:08,449 --> 01:42:11,140
of your stuff?

1022
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,340
No. You don't lose shit

1023
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:16,340
when you... Okay, so there's two sides

1024
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:18,579
there. There's definitely gonna be

1025
01:42:18,579 --> 01:42:20,579
some kind of penalty for resurrecting.

1026
01:42:20,579 --> 01:42:22,579
But the penalty for not resurrecting is losing half

1027
01:42:22,579 --> 01:42:26,779
your shit. Okay.

1028
01:42:26,779 --> 01:42:29,470
I didn't... Hold on. I didn't

1029
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:31,470
go this way at all. What is over here?

1030
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:35,810
This is

1031
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:37,810
an NPC that I haven't even talked to.

1032
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:49,779
Your name? Won't tell me.

1033
01:42:49,779 --> 01:42:51,779
But you do have the look of a skilled

1034
01:42:51,779 --> 01:42:53,779
shinobi. A shinobi.

1035
01:42:53,779 --> 01:42:56,590
Or perhaps.

1036
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:58,590
Sir, please heed

1037
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:00,590
my humble request. Face me

1038
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:03,149
in battle.

1039
01:43:03,149 --> 01:43:05,149
I wasn't

1040
01:43:05,149 --> 01:43:11,420
ready for that.

1041
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:13,420
Wait a minute, this is like a from

1042
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,420
software game. Should I let this guy kill me?

1043
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:19,390
Should I not have done that to this guy?

1044
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:26,289
Oh.

1045
01:43:26,289 --> 01:43:34,930
Is that it? Are we friends now?

1046
01:43:34,930 --> 01:43:39,789
Do I get to have your house?

1047
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:12,850
He's... Not wrong.

1048
01:44:15,659 --> 01:44:17,659
He's kind of morbid, but okay.

1049
01:44:17,659 --> 01:44:19,659
Yeah.

1050
01:44:19,659 --> 01:44:24,460
I guess.

1051
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,899
He's just bored.

1052
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:31,260
Let's do it again.

1053
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:41,500
Training.

1054
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,500
Practice the basics of evasion.

1055
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
Practice the basics of attacking.

1056
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:49,090
What's the flex?

1057
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:51,649
This is cool.

1058
01:44:51,649 --> 01:44:57,470
Sometimes relentless attack is not enough.

1059
01:44:57,470 --> 01:44:59,470
You have deflecting enemies' attacks, damages their posture.

1060
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:03,060
Do three death blows.

1061
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:17,970
I'm dead. I'm back.

1062
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:30,270
I will.

1063
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,960
I didn't even know you could do this.

1064
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,960
Hold on. You can.

1065
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,970
So there is a hold down

1066
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:46,340
in charge. Alright.

1067
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,340
Basics of attacking.

1068
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:50,340
I stand as your opponent.

1069
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:55,649
An enemy with broken

1070
01:45:55,649 --> 01:45:57,649
posture is vulnerable

1071
01:45:57,649 --> 01:45:59,649
to three death blows.

1072
01:45:59,649 --> 01:46:01,649
Yes, yes, yes.

1073
01:46:01,649 --> 01:46:14,369
Kid. Kid.

1074
01:46:14,369 --> 01:46:19,220
I wonder if eventually

1075
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:21,220
I can get... I'm probably going to get some posture breaking

1076
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:23,220
stuff.

1077
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,220
Right. I'm going to get a

1078
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:27,220
thing that costs 10

1079
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:29,220
emblems to use and it's going to break like

1080
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:31,220
50% posture or something. Alright. Step dodge.

1081
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:33,220
We didn't really even learn this.

1082
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,220
I stand as your opponent.

1083
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:40,399
It allows you to avoid attacks. Dodging won't compromise

1084
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:42,399
enemy posture but may help

1085
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:44,399
avoid damage.

1086
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:46,399
Evade enemy attacks and then attack and

1087
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:48,399
perform three death blows.

1088
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:57,229
Yes, I will.

1089
01:46:57,229 --> 01:46:59,229
I like how the animation of the death blow can happen

1090
01:46:59,229 --> 01:47:01,229
in front or behind. It's cool.

1091
01:47:08,829 --> 01:47:24,050
Kid. Kid.

1092
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:28,079
Spend the whole stream killing this

1093
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:30,079
one guy. So you can

1094
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:32,510
feel good.

1095
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:34,939
I think it's about time we tried

1096
01:47:34,939 --> 01:47:36,939
something closer to a real fight.

1097
01:47:36,939 --> 01:47:39,949
Come at me with the intent to kill.

1098
01:47:39,949 --> 01:47:41,949
No better way to prepare

1099
01:47:41,949 --> 01:47:45,020
for the real thing. What's wrong?

1100
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:47,020
Why do you go to such lengths?

1101
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:49,020
Half to pass the time.

1102
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:51,020
And the other half... Expert training.

1103
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:53,020
I want to loosen that

1104
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:55,020
furrowed brow of yours.

1105
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:57,710
Alright. Enough talk.

1106
01:47:57,710 --> 01:47:59,710
Sorry. Let's begin.

1107
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:02,529
Free combat is now available.

1108
01:48:02,529 --> 01:48:05,279
Begin free combat. Fundamentals.

1109
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:07,279
Now. Let's begin.

1110
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:09,710
Yes.

1111
01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:11,710
You got more?

1112
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:13,710
Practice what you've learned. Sure thing.

1113
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:23,310
Fine. I'll just break you.

1114
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:26,899
I'll break you.

1115
01:48:26,899 --> 01:48:35,649
Again.

1116
01:48:35,649 --> 01:48:37,649
So when they go for a grab

1117
01:48:37,649 --> 01:48:47,760
they don't get attacked. New training

1118
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:52,609
is available. What?

1119
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:56,189
Counter...

1120
01:48:56,189 --> 01:48:58,939
This is a...

1121
01:48:58,939 --> 01:49:01,119
This is going to be a

1122
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:03,119
consecutive deflection.

1123
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:07,729
I stand as your opponent.

1124
01:49:07,729 --> 01:49:10,029
Okay. Deflecting once

1125
01:49:10,029 --> 01:49:12,029
doesn't always mean an enemy will stop attacking.

1126
01:49:12,029 --> 01:49:14,029
Consecutive attacks can be countered with

1127
01:49:14,029 --> 01:49:16,029
consecutive deflections. Which can

1128
01:49:16,029 --> 01:49:18,029
greatly damage enemy posture.

1129
01:49:18,029 --> 01:49:20,029
Deflect all enemy attacks.

1130
01:49:20,029 --> 01:49:22,029
And before three death blows.

1131
01:49:22,029 --> 01:49:25,229
Let's see what happens here.

1132
01:49:25,229 --> 01:49:29,579
Three, four...

1133
01:49:29,579 --> 01:49:31,579
You gotta get it though. You gotta time it.

1134
01:49:31,579 --> 01:49:33,579
So it's...

1135
01:49:33,579 --> 01:49:39,659
That's going to be so hard

1136
01:49:39,659 --> 01:49:47,220
later on.

1137
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:50,930
Imagine some of the bosses later on

1138
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:52,930
that you're going to have to do that like ten times

1139
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:56,130
in a row. Alright. Vitality

1140
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:58,130
and posture.

1141
01:49:58,130 --> 01:50:00,130
You might as well just practice now.

1142
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:05,060
The lower one's vitality the slower their posture

1143
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:07,060
recovery is. This is good to know.

1144
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:09,060
For enemies with seemingly unbreakable

1145
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:11,060
posture use techniques such as

1146
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:13,060
dodge.

1147
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:15,060
Counterattack reduces their vitality.

1148
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:17,060
Making their posture easier to break.

1149
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:19,060
Ah.

1150
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:21,550
Okay.

1151
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:24,050
So...

1152
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,050
Alright. This is very important

1153
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:30,020
information. So

1154
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:32,020
if somebody has high health

1155
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:34,020
you're not going to ever be able to break

1156
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:36,020
their posture if they're hard to break through.

1157
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:38,020
So you have to get their health

1158
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:40,449
down by dodging

1159
01:50:40,449 --> 01:50:42,449
or by hurting them. Not by

1160
01:50:42,449 --> 01:50:44,449
going blow to blow with the sword.

1161
01:50:44,449 --> 01:50:46,819
To a point where you can bring down

1162
01:50:46,819 --> 01:50:49,310
their posture. I would have

1163
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:51,310
been raging at

1164
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:53,310
this later on.

1165
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:55,310
Why does this guy have such high posture?

1166
01:50:55,310 --> 01:50:57,310
Game's fucking broken.

1167
01:50:57,310 --> 01:51:10,750
So it's good that I did this.

1168
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:14,140
So they recover posture slowly.

1169
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:16,140
Oh that's so much better.

1170
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,140
Yeah look at that.

1171
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:22,689
You can just swing it on like once or twice.

1172
01:51:22,689 --> 01:51:26,340
Yeah.

1173
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:28,340
That is a huge piece of information

1174
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:37,810
that you need to know.

1175
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:44,579
How bad it is. I'm glad I figured this out.

1176
01:51:44,579 --> 01:51:50,270
Alright let's come back to the

1177
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:52,270
back out here please. I don't want to

1178
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:59,569
phase out.

1179
01:51:59,569 --> 01:52:09,869
I did not see this tutorial.

1180
01:52:09,869 --> 01:52:12,689
This guy's actually fairly easy just to

1181
01:52:12,689 --> 01:52:15,890
walk by and never see.

1182
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:17,890
It doesn't lower their posture, only their posture regeneration.

1183
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:19,890
Yeah but that's still a big deal though.

1184
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:22,960
I'm going to do it all. Countering

1185
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:24,960
thrust attacks.

1186
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:28,350
You can kill through vitality

1187
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:30,350
as well as long as you can hit them

1188
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:32,350
I guess somewhere in their back or a place where they can't

1189
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:35,979
block.

1190
01:52:35,979 --> 01:52:37,979
Thrust attacks cannot be guarded

1191
01:52:37,979 --> 01:52:39,979
but they can be countered by deflecting

1192
01:52:39,979 --> 01:52:41,979
or step dodging to the side.

1193
01:52:41,979 --> 01:52:44,859
Okay I was kind of panicking when I saw this before.

1194
01:52:44,859 --> 01:52:47,170
So if you do a side

1195
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:49,340
dodge you can counter.

1196
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:53,119
Or if you deflect.

1197
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:55,619
Or do a step dodge.

1198
01:52:55,619 --> 01:52:57,920
Alright so there you go. So before I thought you had to

1199
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,920
Okay.

1200
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:05,619
You can also block it too.

1201
01:53:05,619 --> 01:53:07,619
It's the right time that is.

1202
01:53:07,619 --> 01:53:14,720
You've got to be perfect. I'm not certain

1203
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,720
I'm confident in being able to deflect

1204
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,720
that especially if it goes right for you

1205
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,720
and you can't block it.

1206
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:25,819
Maybe.

1207
01:53:25,819 --> 01:53:27,819
What happens if this guy kills you?

1208
01:53:27,819 --> 01:53:30,260
You take his place.

1209
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:34,220
This is important. Sweep attacks.

1210
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:41,409
Sweep attacks cannot be guarded

1211
01:53:41,409 --> 01:53:43,409
or deflected. They must be jumped over

1212
01:53:43,409 --> 01:53:45,409
to be avoided.

1213
01:53:45,409 --> 01:53:47,409
Jump kicking an enemy during sweep attacks

1214
01:53:47,409 --> 01:53:49,409
deals heavy posture

1215
01:53:49,409 --> 01:53:51,409
damage. Perfect.

1216
01:53:51,409 --> 01:53:53,409
Often leading directly to a

1217
01:53:53,409 --> 01:53:56,670
death blow. Also great to know.

1218
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:58,670
So jump in mid-air near the enemy

1219
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:00,670
jump kick and it does a ton of posture damage.

1220
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:03,939
Let's take a look.

1221
01:54:03,939 --> 01:54:08,100
Oh it's no. Alright

1222
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:10,100
hold on a minute. It's just A twice.

1223
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:14,239
Right.

1224
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:17,119
Holy shit.

1225
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:19,119
If I knew that before.

1226
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:23,859
That last boss

1227
01:54:23,859 --> 01:54:25,859
that little mini boss that I fought.

1228
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:27,859
That general. I would have killed him in probably

1229
01:54:27,859 --> 01:54:29,859
15 seconds.

1230
01:54:29,859 --> 01:54:44,430
Again.

1231
01:54:44,430 --> 01:54:46,430
How far? Okay you've got to be

1232
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:48,430
close though. You can't do

1233
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:52,909
it from that far away.

1234
01:54:52,909 --> 01:55:05,100
Again.

1235
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:07,100
So the easiest way

1236
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:09,100
to remember that is sweep is

1237
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:12,109
AA. Thrust is

1238
01:55:12,109 --> 01:55:14,109
dodge or deflect.

1239
01:55:14,109 --> 01:55:16,479
And grab is dodge.

1240
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:20,300
Let's do it again. Free combat.

1241
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:35,630
What do you got? Back up this way.

1242
01:55:35,630 --> 01:55:38,899
Come on.

1243
01:55:38,899 --> 01:55:40,899
You're too far away. Oh

1244
01:55:40,899 --> 01:55:42,899
okay. I've got to get that right.

1245
01:55:42,899 --> 01:55:46,029
Ooh. It's hard to tell

1246
01:55:46,029 --> 01:55:48,029
sometimes. Ooh.

1247
01:55:48,029 --> 01:55:51,619
Thrust. Thrust is deflect

1248
01:55:51,619 --> 01:55:53,619
or dodge. You know what? I'm going to do dodge.

1249
01:55:53,619 --> 01:55:55,619
If I see that and I know it's a thrust

1250
01:55:55,619 --> 01:56:07,010
I'm going to dodge.

1251
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:10,720
Yeah the sword comes up to the

1252
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,720
head.

1253
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,899
Oh easier on me.

1254
01:56:20,899 --> 01:56:22,899
Apologize.

1255
01:56:22,899 --> 01:56:24,899
I'm so sorry

1256
01:56:24,899 --> 01:56:26,899
sir. I don't mean to kill you.

1257
01:56:26,899 --> 01:56:29,520
I've killed him like 12 times.

1258
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,520
Give thanks or apologize. I feel like this is important.

1259
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,739
Maybe I'm going to say sorry.

1260
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:39,840
Give thanks or apologize.

1261
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,840
Give thanks or apologize. One false

1262
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,489
move and this could go wrong.

1263
01:56:51,010 --> 01:56:53,949
Apologize. Bloodthirsty

1264
01:56:53,949 --> 01:56:55,949
streamer.

1265
01:57:01,949 --> 01:57:03,949
What?

1266
01:57:07,949 --> 01:57:11,729
Okay.

1267
01:57:11,729 --> 01:57:13,729
So

1268
01:57:13,729 --> 01:57:15,729
that's the training. What about talking?

1269
01:57:19,729 --> 01:57:21,729
What is that? From left?

1270
01:57:21,729 --> 01:57:23,729
A from laugh?

1271
01:57:23,729 --> 01:57:25,729
Yep.

1272
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:33,680
It's in every game. Wait.

1273
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,680
Something interesting in the box?

1274
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:39,970
What's in the box? Items that become

1275
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:41,970
unavailable elsewhere end up in the offering box.

1276
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:45,100
When the box is

1277
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,100
illuminated it means an item has found its way inside.

1278
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,100
Items can be obtained by inspecting the box

1279
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:52,430
and offering money.

1280
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:56,510
The box is empty. Okay.

1281
01:57:56,510 --> 01:58:00,159
First P?

1282
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:02,159
I think it's time for the first P

1283
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,779
of the day.

1284
01:58:04,779 --> 01:58:06,779
Two hours. Two hours per P.

1285
01:58:06,779 --> 01:58:09,409
See you in like two minutes.

1286
02:00:49,699 --> 02:00:57,060
Who the fuck would sub to German?

1287
02:00:57,060 --> 02:01:00,770
You? You're subbed.

1288
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:02,770
There's $50

1289
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:04,770
from a minute, two minutes ago.

1290
02:01:04,770 --> 02:01:08,420
Toshiro.tv just gave $50.

1291
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:11,420
You guys are showering me with fucking

1292
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:14,050
money tonight. Holy shit.

1293
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:16,739
Thank you. How do you feel knowing you

1294
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:18,739
can hurricane Rana in From Software

1295
02:01:18,739 --> 02:01:21,810
games? Very satisfying

1296
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:29,489
to do these moves.

1297
02:01:29,489 --> 02:01:31,729
A green shower.

1298
02:01:31,729 --> 02:01:33,729
Seriously, I don't even know

1299
02:01:33,729 --> 02:01:37,630
what to say. Thank you everybody.

1300
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:40,189
This is an absolute shitload of money.

1301
02:01:40,189 --> 02:01:43,260
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1302
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:45,260
That's all I can say.

1303
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:49,420
I can't believe it.

1304
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:51,659
Let's hope you're enjoying the stream.

1305
02:01:51,659 --> 02:01:57,359
Speaking of the stream. Do you ever go to bed soaking

1306
02:01:57,359 --> 02:01:59,859
wet? Oh.

1307
02:01:59,859 --> 02:02:01,859
Do you ever go to bed soaking wet? I do not.

1308
02:02:01,859 --> 02:02:03,859
I do not go to bed soaking wet.

1309
02:02:03,859 --> 02:02:07,180
Cool. So we learned some tactics, some

1310
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:09,180
techniques. Things that are good to know.

1311
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:11,810
Let's continue the

1312
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:16,100
journey. Didn't I get a better

1313
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:18,590
healing gourd? Healing gourd.

1314
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:23,710
There we go. Purchase

1315
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:25,710
travel enhance. I don't have it.

1316
02:02:25,710 --> 02:02:27,710
Can I lose these prayer beads?

1317
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:30,590
I'm scared I'm going to lose the prayer beads.

1318
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:36,350
Turn on the Japanese

1319
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:38,350
dialogue for a cutscene or two.

1320
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:41,869
Alright. After

1321
02:02:41,869 --> 02:02:52,750
I beat

1322
02:02:52,750 --> 02:02:54,750
the first boss. I'll do it.

1323
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:56,750
Which will be in like 15 minutes. I'm fucking being

1324
02:02:56,750 --> 02:03:01,039
the first try.

1325
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:03,039
Back to it. This is where the

1326
02:03:03,039 --> 02:03:05,039
we just sit right here. This guy doesn't respawn.

1327
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:07,539
I don't think.

1328
02:03:07,539 --> 02:03:12,020
Progress.

1329
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:19,630
Why do you cough then mute the mic?

1330
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:21,630
Well, because it's hard to

1331
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:23,630
suppress a cough and I have to reach forward

1332
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,189
and press button

1333
02:03:26,189 --> 02:03:28,189
here on my stream deck.

1334
02:03:28,189 --> 02:03:30,189
So what happens is I end up getting like

1335
02:03:30,189 --> 02:03:32,189
a quarter of it out before I have to press this button

1336
02:03:32,189 --> 02:03:34,189
here to mute. So it's hard to

1337
02:03:34,189 --> 02:03:36,189
sometimes predict it's

1338
02:03:36,189 --> 02:03:38,189
going to happen. Mute and then do it. I've done it

1339
02:03:38,189 --> 02:03:40,189
you probably heard a few

1340
02:03:40,189 --> 02:03:42,189
times it just go dead silent because I caught it early.

1341
02:03:42,189 --> 02:03:46,739
I am trying to

1342
02:03:46,739 --> 02:03:48,739
squelch that though.

1343
02:03:48,739 --> 02:03:50,739
I do apologize if it's annoying.

1344
02:03:50,739 --> 02:03:56,739
Okay.

1345
02:03:56,739 --> 02:03:58,739
Trees. Look at all these places to jump to.

1346
02:03:58,739 --> 02:04:00,739
All right. What we got? One guy.

1347
02:04:00,739 --> 02:04:03,170
Crows. We're going to go

1348
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:05,659
crow route. Maybe.

1349
02:04:05,659 --> 02:04:08,670
I'm not quite close enough to that.

1350
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:16,350
I can go this way.

1351
02:04:16,350 --> 02:04:20,640
I have to see what's going on with

1352
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:27,920
these crows.

1353
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,920
Light coin purse. Before it's filled with

1354
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:31,920
a small amount of sen it can be used to acquire

1355
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:33,920
the sen inside. Has a somewhat

1356
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,920
satisfying weight to it.

1357
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:46,079
I'm not opening that.

1358
02:04:46,079 --> 02:04:48,079
Oh my god.

1359
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:50,079
Oh.

1360
02:04:50,079 --> 02:04:52,079
I was trying to jump.

1361
02:04:52,079 --> 02:04:56,430
Somebody has a gun.

1362
02:04:56,430 --> 02:04:58,930
Who has the gun? That's

1363
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:08,590
guy. Boy there's a lot of people here.

1364
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:10,590
Which one has the gun?

1365
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:21,329
I'm not even locked onto him.

1366
02:05:21,329 --> 02:05:23,329
That guy. No. I think he doesn't

1367
02:05:23,329 --> 02:05:30,619
have a gun. Shit.

1368
02:05:30,619 --> 02:05:34,340
Oh my

1369
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:38,300
god. There's too many people.

1370
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:44,130
Actually too many people.

1371
02:05:44,130 --> 02:05:46,369
Aggro the whole entire

1372
02:05:46,369 --> 02:05:48,369
fucking city.

1373
02:05:48,369 --> 02:05:56,819
So unlike other

1374
02:05:56,819 --> 02:05:58,819
From Software games. No I was just

1375
02:05:58,819 --> 02:06:00,819
locked onto that guy.

1376
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:03,250
It's actually really hard to fight more than one

1377
02:06:03,250 --> 02:06:07,789
person at a time. Before you could kind of

1378
02:06:07,789 --> 02:06:09,789
just get like a big weapon and just swing it in a circle

1379
02:06:09,789 --> 02:06:11,789
and kill five people. Oh my god.

1380
02:06:11,789 --> 02:06:13,789
Somebody just gave 20 community subs.

1381
02:06:13,789 --> 02:06:34,510
Come here. No wrong guy.

1382
02:06:34,510 --> 02:06:36,510
I wanted to lock onto the guy in front of me.

1383
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:39,199
Why the hell would I want to lock onto the guy

1384
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:45,789
behind him? I can't see

1385
02:06:45,789 --> 02:06:51,869
shit. Oh fuck I'm dead.

1386
02:06:55,069 --> 02:07:03,329
Come on. Swing. Come on.

1387
02:07:03,329 --> 02:07:05,699
Swing.

1388
02:07:05,699 --> 02:07:19,970
There's still somebody with a gun.

1389
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:21,970
Alright. Who gave the 20 community subs?

1390
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:26,829
Seriously. I

1391
02:07:26,829 --> 02:07:30,670
missed it. Those gift subs

1392
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:32,670
just crashed the app on my

1393
02:07:32,670 --> 02:07:34,670
phone. It's Bob.

1394
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:36,670
It's Bob time.

1395
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:42,289
Thank you Bob. And thank

1396
02:07:42,289 --> 02:07:45,739
you for your time. Alright.

1397
02:07:45,739 --> 02:07:48,800
I gotta get up. I'm killing this

1398
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:53,279
guy. Can I like stealth

1399
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:58,460
grab him or something?

1400
02:07:58,460 --> 02:08:00,460
I guess. I guess so.

1401
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:03,020
That whizzed right by my head.

1402
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:05,020
I'm just gonna take it.

1403
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:11,220
Cause it...

1404
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,220
Oh what?

1405
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:15,220
I didn't. No.

1406
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:17,220
I was trying to. I was gonna

1407
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:19,220
block it. I couldn't even see him.

1408
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:26,939
Should I resurrect?

1409
02:08:26,939 --> 02:08:28,939
Oh I don't know what this means. I don't know

1410
02:08:28,939 --> 02:08:30,939
how bad this is. No I'm just dying.

1411
02:08:30,939 --> 02:08:35,229
This is gonna be bad for me to resurrect this

1412
02:08:35,229 --> 02:08:37,229
many times in the beginning of the game.

1413
02:08:37,229 --> 02:08:44,979
I'm so scared to resurrect.

1414
02:08:44,979 --> 02:08:54,130
Alright. Well this time I don't want

1415
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:56,430
to aggro the entire

1416
02:08:56,430 --> 02:09:01,550
camp. Death is worse.

1417
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:03,979
I don't know

1418
02:09:03,979 --> 02:09:10,060
that yet. I still have the coin

1419
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:12,060
purse. So I'm good. Alright.

1420
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:14,060
Let's jump down here in stealth.

1421
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:25,579
I don't think it's a penalty for resurrecting.

1422
02:09:25,579 --> 02:09:31,279
Where's the

1423
02:09:31,279 --> 02:09:33,279
guy with the shoot you in the head

1424
02:09:33,279 --> 02:09:37,439
sniper rifle?

1425
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:39,439
There's an item over there. He's right there.

1426
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:41,439
Alright. I'm gonna wrap around. This is what I'm gonna do.

1427
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:44,380
Go on over there. I'm gonna jump on the

1428
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:47,010
tree. Can they see me

1429
02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:49,699
on top of them? Do they have the ability

1430
02:09:49,699 --> 02:09:53,600
to look up in the air?

1431
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:56,289
Let's eavesdrop.

1432
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:12,449
I want that item down here.

1433
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:25,779
What? Where was my

1434
02:10:25,779 --> 02:10:27,779
Well can't you do a stealth takedown?

1435
02:10:27,779 --> 02:10:29,779
I thought it was a stealth

1436
02:10:29,779 --> 02:10:31,779
takedown. Huh?

1437
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:51,920
Alright. It's just a fucking vase.

1438
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:55,630
I thought if you jumped off of the

1439
02:10:55,630 --> 02:10:57,630
of a perch you could

1440
02:10:57,630 --> 02:11:02,500
do a apparently

1441
02:11:02,500 --> 02:11:04,500
not. Alright. Well that's good to know.

1442
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:08,399
So I'm gonna go. Let's just keep

1443
02:11:08,399 --> 02:11:10,399
wait there's a guy right there. Three

1444
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:14,560
people there. There's the whole

1445
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:16,930
camp. I can take that guy out.

1446
02:11:16,930 --> 02:11:19,420
And nobody over here right?

1447
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:27,739
Holy shit this guy's

1448
02:11:27,739 --> 02:11:32,029
huge. Alright.

1449
02:11:32,029 --> 02:11:44,770
No don't do that. I had to get

1450
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:49,630
the big dude with the mallard. Only one

1451
02:11:49,630 --> 02:11:52,060
guy saw that. This guy.

1452
02:11:52,060 --> 02:12:00,430
Okay.

1453
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:04,000
There's an item in here too. I'm being

1454
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
followed.

1455
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:32,880
I don't got time to fucking care about this right now

1456
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,880
but you can get more

1457
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,880
items. Ooh. What's this?

1458
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:39,119
Ooh. Ooh.

1459
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:41,119
I don't know. Who saw me?

1460
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:43,119
Who has a gun shooting at me? It's that person.

1461
02:12:43,119 --> 02:12:52,510
Reloading. That was a really

1462
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:54,510
quick reload by the way.

1463
02:12:54,510 --> 02:13:10,050
Just take them all out.

1464
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:24,939
I got too greedy there.

1465
02:13:24,939 --> 02:13:26,939
Just drink. I don't want to do that again.

1466
02:13:26,939 --> 02:13:34,300
What? How did I not deflect that?

1467
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:36,300
You're making me look bad.

1468
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:40,079
I almost cleared the whole

1469
02:13:40,079 --> 02:13:45,069
area. I feel like I should use some of this shit.

1470
02:13:45,069 --> 02:13:52,300
Wait, wait, wait.

1471
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:54,300
There's a lot to look at here.

1472
02:13:54,300 --> 02:14:00,000
Don't fall off that.

1473
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,010
Why would you let me go over there?

1474
02:14:03,010 --> 02:14:09,789
Don't want to miss anything

1475
02:14:09,789 --> 02:14:11,789
like something over here. Right?

1476
02:14:11,789 --> 02:14:17,470
No. Why are you

1477
02:14:17,470 --> 02:14:20,159
here? Why are you making me

1478
02:14:20,159 --> 02:14:22,159
think there's something over there?

1479
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:25,619
Typical from. See what I mean?

1480
02:14:25,619 --> 02:14:31,359
Is that an enemy?

1481
02:14:31,359 --> 02:14:36,539
I think it's an NPC.

1482
02:14:36,539 --> 02:14:40,060
It is an NPC but who is this?

1483
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:52,739
It's just a chicken.

1484
02:14:52,739 --> 02:14:54,739
Chicken.

1485
02:14:56,739 --> 02:15:07,409
Alright, we're fine.

1486
02:15:07,409 --> 02:15:09,409
I am going to sneak in here though.

1487
02:15:09,409 --> 02:15:13,569
Look at this free shit.

1488
02:15:13,569 --> 02:15:15,939
Coin purse.

1489
02:15:15,939 --> 02:15:19,520
Coin purse.

1490
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,520
Coin purse.

1491
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:26,319
Nice. Now the question is

1492
02:15:26,319 --> 02:15:28,319
is the person up top an NPC?

1493
02:15:28,319 --> 02:15:35,680
And are they going to get startled if I jump up here?

1494
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,680
Let's just see what happens.

1495
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:39,680
They have a marker over them so

1496
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:43,329
I'm going to assume you're friendly.

1497
02:15:43,329 --> 02:15:47,170
For now.

1498
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:58,500
Have you seen...

1499
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:00,500
I'm not your son.

1500
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:04,189
Sorry.

1501
02:16:04,189 --> 02:16:06,189
She reminds me of one of those bloodborne enemies that has the lanterns.

1502
02:16:06,189 --> 02:16:09,899
Or what if I just pretend I'm

1503
02:16:09,899 --> 02:16:16,239
the son?

1504
02:16:16,239 --> 02:16:18,239
If I don't say anything to her.

1505
02:16:18,239 --> 02:16:20,239
She thinks I'm her kid.

1506
02:16:20,239 --> 02:16:22,239
If I talk it

1507
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:24,239
takes it all down away.

1508
02:16:24,239 --> 02:16:26,239
Oh.

1509
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:30,239
Got it.

1510
02:17:04,579 --> 02:17:06,579
Okay.

1511
02:17:06,579 --> 02:17:08,579
Anything else?

1512
02:17:08,579 --> 02:17:10,750
Huh.

1513
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:12,750
Alright.

1514
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:20,100
Sprint push off cliff.

1515
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:22,100
I can talk to that person too.

1516
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:27,409
What do you have to say?

1517
02:17:27,409 --> 02:17:35,540
Uh...

1518
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:45,760
I can...

1519
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:48,260
What if I say nothing?

1520
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:51,069
Am I just going to be silent

1521
02:17:51,069 --> 02:17:53,069
protagonist in this stream?

1522
02:17:53,069 --> 02:17:55,069
I feel like I should say something.

1523
02:17:55,069 --> 02:17:58,079
Yes.

1524
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:02,670
Do you have any prayer beads?

1525
02:18:02,670 --> 02:18:06,510
Oh.

1526
02:18:06,510 --> 02:18:08,510
This is the son.

1527
02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:43,180
Okay.

1528
02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:55,860
So should I offer it?

1529
02:18:55,860 --> 02:18:58,739
Probably should go back.

1530
02:18:58,739 --> 02:19:00,739
Offer it to Buddha, come back, and then...

1531
02:19:00,739 --> 02:19:02,739
Yeah, but I need another checkpoint though.

1532
02:19:02,739 --> 02:19:04,739
That was hell getting through that.

1533
02:19:04,739 --> 02:19:06,739
That was such a pain in the ass.

1534
02:19:06,739 --> 02:19:10,069
There's so many enemies here.

1535
02:19:10,069 --> 02:19:12,069
Where's the illusory wall to give me

1536
02:19:12,069 --> 02:19:17,000
a new bonfire?

1537
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:26,979
There might be one right here.

1538
02:19:26,979 --> 02:19:33,000
Of course, right when I walk down here.

1539
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I can go up, but...

1540
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,350
Is there like a...

1541
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:41,909
Can I do that?

1542
02:19:41,909 --> 02:19:51,770
How do you do that?

1543
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:54,520
Oh, the ceramics. Right, right, right.

1544
02:19:54,520 --> 02:20:02,840
That's how you do...

1545
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:05,139
That's a big guy.

1546
02:20:05,139 --> 02:20:09,110
That guy has a bed post.

1547
02:20:09,110 --> 02:20:11,930
Watch out for the giant guy with the bed post.

1548
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:14,420
No, I cannot whistle. I don't know how.

1549
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:16,420
I'm going to throw a ceramic over here.

1550
02:20:16,420 --> 02:20:18,420
I might as well use them.

1551
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:20,420
You don't see the other zeros.

1552
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:29,770
Alright, so...

1553
02:20:29,770 --> 02:20:40,950
What's the range on that?

1554
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:50,489
What's the range on that?

1555
02:20:50,489 --> 02:20:53,299
I'm just going to pull him. Fuck it.

1556
02:20:53,299 --> 02:20:55,299
The guy with the bed post. That's a cannon.

1557
02:20:55,299 --> 02:20:57,299
That's a mortar.

1558
02:20:57,299 --> 02:21:01,270
Now the guy with the mortar knows I exist.

1559
02:21:01,270 --> 02:21:03,270
Wonderful.

1560
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:11,909
That's just fantastic.

1561
02:21:11,909 --> 02:21:14,280
That's fantastic.

1562
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:19,209
He doesn't see me over here, right?

1563
02:21:19,209 --> 02:21:21,379
Yes, he doesn't.

1564
02:21:21,379 --> 02:21:24,780
He doesn't.

1565
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:26,780
Alright, we've got to move.

1566
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:33,239
I've got to plan.

1567
02:21:33,239 --> 02:21:38,809
Maybe he'll stop. I'll take this.

1568
02:21:38,809 --> 02:21:44,120
Sugar, more sugar.

1569
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:46,120
The high Senpu priest

1570
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:48,120
gave this candy to a band of short

1571
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:50,120
but adept assassins.

1572
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:52,120
Suppresses sound and presence for a time

1573
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:55,190
making the user harder to detect.

1574
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:57,190
So it's a stealth candy.

1575
02:21:57,190 --> 02:21:59,190
Bite the candy and take the

1576
02:21:59,190 --> 02:22:01,190
gachin stance to impart

1577
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:03,190
its inhuman benediction.

1578
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:05,190
Once hired guards, now extensions of the monks

1579
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:07,190
will in their quest for undeath. So it's a stealth candy.

1580
02:22:10,329 --> 02:22:14,420
Apparently somebody can see me over here.

1581
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:19,540
I don't know who. Who can see me?

1582
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:23,180
I don't know.

1583
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:30,139
Let's go.

1584
02:22:30,139 --> 02:22:32,309
I almost just fell off.

1585
02:22:32,309 --> 02:22:34,489
I'm going to grab that tree.

1586
02:22:34,489 --> 02:22:36,489
It's not safe. Please.

1587
02:22:36,489 --> 02:22:41,159
Okay, we're fine. I wonder if he gave up

1588
02:22:41,159 --> 02:22:56,459
shooting. I can sneak behind

1589
02:22:56,459 --> 02:23:01,129
him. Nobody else over here, right?

1590
02:23:01,129 --> 02:23:03,129
I'm going for it. He's not stupid

1591
02:23:03,129 --> 02:23:05,129
enough to turn around and just fire the cannon at my face, right?

1592
02:23:05,129 --> 02:23:14,979
Black gunpowder.

1593
02:23:14,979 --> 02:23:17,350
Material used in alchemical

1594
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:19,350
prosthetic tool upgrades, including those

1595
02:23:19,350 --> 02:23:21,350
of an explosive and occultic nature.

1596
02:23:21,350 --> 02:23:23,350
Even the most mundane form

1597
02:23:23,350 --> 02:23:25,350
of gunpowder has a wide variety of applications.

1598
02:23:25,350 --> 02:23:31,750
So

1599
02:23:31,750 --> 02:23:34,180
gunpowder. Let's go ahead and take

1600
02:23:34,180 --> 02:23:36,180
out the two people in the front door.

1601
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:38,180
You know, like LOL.

1602
02:23:41,370 --> 02:23:43,370
What you meant to say is just

1603
02:23:43,370 --> 02:23:45,930
fucking do that and do it again.

1604
02:23:45,930 --> 02:24:00,629
Nice.

1605
02:24:00,629 --> 02:24:02,629
How many healing? I don't have any healing left.

1606
02:24:02,629 --> 02:24:04,809
I just have pellets, which is

1607
02:24:04,809 --> 02:24:08,840
bad. Oh, whoa.

1608
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:10,840
Wait a minute. What's that? Look at all that.

1609
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:12,840
Look at all that shit.

1610
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:15,979
I got to get over there.

1611
02:24:15,979 --> 02:24:20,819
How do I get there? Can I? Come on.

1612
02:24:20,819 --> 02:24:26,579
Is it the first cookie bug in the game?

1613
02:24:26,579 --> 02:24:28,819
No. A cookie bug's even

1614
02:24:28,819 --> 02:24:35,799
in this game. I don't think there are

1615
02:24:35,799 --> 02:24:37,799
those bugs are even in this game.

1616
02:24:37,799 --> 02:24:44,200
Possession balloon.

1617
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:46,200
A people balloon filled with fountainhead water

1618
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:48,200
with the blessing of fortune.

1619
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:50,200
If one pops this vibrant green balloon,

1620
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:52,200
those as water flashes

1621
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,200
will have a higher chance of obtaining items.

1622
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:56,200
So it's like magic find.

1623
02:24:56,200 --> 02:25:01,059
Magic find.

1624
02:25:01,059 --> 02:25:03,239
Two magic find balloons.

1625
02:25:03,239 --> 02:25:11,180
Another item over here.

1626
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:25,049
Any more? Iron.

1627
02:25:25,049 --> 02:25:27,479
Basic reinforcement.

1628
02:25:27,479 --> 02:25:29,909
Maybe this is

1629
02:25:29,909 --> 02:25:31,909
like the shards, possibly.

1630
02:25:31,909 --> 02:25:34,090
I don't even know

1631
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:36,090
what the hell I'm going right now.

1632
02:25:36,090 --> 02:25:39,860
What did I do?

1633
02:25:39,860 --> 02:25:41,860
Where did I end up? I'm going all

1634
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:44,549
the way around the mountain.

1635
02:25:44,549 --> 02:25:47,239
I guess we're going to

1636
02:25:47,239 --> 02:26:03,180
keep going this way. Whoa.

1637
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:05,180
Can those rocks fall? Is there a

1638
02:26:05,180 --> 02:26:09,459
better place for me to go from here?

1639
02:26:09,459 --> 02:26:24,309
Can I hug this wall? Please.

1640
02:26:24,309 --> 02:26:41,829
I hate when it does

1641
02:26:41,829 --> 02:26:43,829
that. I keep thinking I'm going to fall off.

1642
02:26:43,829 --> 02:26:48,629
Absolutely gorgeous.

1643
02:26:48,629 --> 02:26:50,629
It's a gorgeous game. Gorgeous.

1644
02:26:50,629 --> 02:26:56,629
Uh...

1645
02:26:59,190 --> 02:27:01,879
Spider-Man? Maybe a

1646
02:27:01,879 --> 02:27:04,250
Spider-Man scenario? I'm going to try!

1647
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:06,489
Oh!

1648
02:27:06,489 --> 02:27:09,110
That could have been bad.

1649
02:27:09,110 --> 02:27:11,989
I would have lost half my HP.

1650
02:27:11,989 --> 02:27:22,870
It seems

1651
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:24,870
so much bigger

1652
02:27:24,870 --> 02:27:27,500
than any of their previous games.

1653
02:27:27,500 --> 02:27:31,209
It's open. It's huge.

1654
02:27:31,209 --> 02:27:33,209
There's a lot to explore. It's almost overwhelming.

1655
02:27:33,209 --> 02:27:35,209
Because of how big this is.

1656
02:27:35,209 --> 02:27:37,829
And how much you can see.

1657
02:27:37,829 --> 02:27:39,829
There's a lot of people over here, so hold on.

1658
02:27:39,829 --> 02:27:41,829
Oh! Give me, give me, give me!

1659
02:27:41,829 --> 02:27:46,889
Thank God.

1660
02:27:46,889 --> 02:27:55,399
It's all the vertical movement. Yeah.

1661
02:27:55,399 --> 02:27:58,280
There's a lot of it. Alright, let me go back

1662
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:01,479
to the town and

1663
02:28:01,479 --> 02:28:03,479
see what he has to say about this bell

1664
02:28:03,479 --> 02:28:10,200
thing. Great Canadian

1665
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:12,200
Fuck Club. Ten community subs.

1666
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:14,629
Back at it again. With the

1667
02:28:14,629 --> 02:28:16,629
major community subs.

1668
02:28:16,629 --> 02:28:18,629
Thank you so much, Great Canadian.

1669
02:28:18,629 --> 02:28:24,649
Let's find out what we can do with this.

1670
02:28:24,649 --> 02:28:28,489
What is it? Seems to be

1671
02:28:28,489 --> 02:28:30,489
your battle sense has returned.

1672
02:28:30,489 --> 02:28:32,489
You're more like a shinobi

1673
02:28:32,489 --> 02:28:34,489
than before. If

1674
02:28:34,489 --> 02:28:36,920
only a little. Take this.

1675
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:39,860
A book of secrets

1676
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:41,860
that details a variety of techniques

1677
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:43,860
grants the ability to learn

1678
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:45,860
shinobi style skills.

1679
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:48,420
Within this text are the

1680
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:50,420
innermost secrets of the shinobi arts.

1681
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:52,420
Such as attacks performed in the air

1682
02:28:52,420 --> 02:28:54,420
and hiding one's body to avoid

1683
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:56,420
detection.

1684
02:28:56,420 --> 02:28:58,420
What is it? What?

1685
02:28:58,420 --> 02:29:00,420
Shinobi techniques

1686
02:29:00,420 --> 02:29:02,420
recorded within are fighting techniques

1687
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:04,420
that cannot be performed

1688
02:29:04,420 --> 02:29:08,069
by samurai.

1689
02:29:08,069 --> 02:29:10,069
Whether you make use of them or not

1690
02:29:10,069 --> 02:29:12,069
is up to you. Shinobi

1691
02:29:12,069 --> 02:29:14,069
aren't the only ones with their

1692
02:29:14,069 --> 02:29:16,069
own fighting techniques.

1693
02:29:16,069 --> 02:29:18,889
So now

1694
02:29:18,889 --> 02:29:21,579
skills. Owning

1695
02:29:21,579 --> 02:29:23,579
an esoteric text of a combat style

1696
02:29:23,579 --> 02:29:25,579
will allow its skills to be acquired in the

1697
02:29:25,579 --> 02:29:27,579
sculptor's idle skill menu.

1698
02:29:27,579 --> 02:29:29,879
Each enemy defeated provides skill

1699
02:29:29,879 --> 02:29:31,879
experience. Skill points are acquired

1700
02:29:31,879 --> 02:29:33,879
once enough

1701
02:29:33,879 --> 02:29:35,879
experience is gained which can be spent

1702
02:29:35,879 --> 02:29:37,879
to unlock skills. Some skills can

1703
02:29:37,879 --> 02:29:39,879
also be learned by obtaining items or defeating

1704
02:29:39,879 --> 02:29:42,440
enemies.

1705
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:44,440
So there actually is just a level up bar in the game.

1706
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:46,440
Harmony Accord thanks to the five community

1707
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:51,030
subs. Thank you.

1708
02:29:51,030 --> 02:29:53,459
Subs rolling in.

1709
02:29:53,459 --> 02:29:55,459
This is the...

1710
02:29:55,459 --> 02:29:59,049
Is this the...

1711
02:29:59,049 --> 02:30:01,049
What the hell is he telling me?

1712
02:30:05,049 --> 02:30:07,420
I've seen you.

1713
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:35,530
Do I have any new tools? I have gunpowder? No.

1714
02:30:35,530 --> 02:30:44,340
All right.

1715
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:46,340
So this is Prey.

1716
02:30:46,340 --> 02:30:56,889
What does this do?

1717
02:30:56,889 --> 02:30:58,889
Close your eyes.

1718
02:30:58,889 --> 02:31:00,889
Hear the bell speak to you.

1719
02:31:00,889 --> 02:31:03,510
DLC area?

1720
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:17,399
Someone just said sorta.

1721
02:31:17,399 --> 02:31:19,399
The bell's chime

1722
02:31:19,399 --> 02:31:21,399
will stir your

1723
02:31:21,399 --> 02:31:27,340
thoughts. Waken

1724
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:29,340
from their slumber.

1725
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:35,290
Day one

1726
02:31:35,290 --> 02:31:38,870
DLC. Three years

1727
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:44,950
ago.

1728
02:31:44,950 --> 02:31:51,030
So wait am I...

1729
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:53,030
I'm in like a dream world? Dream

1730
02:31:53,030 --> 02:31:55,030
world.

1731
02:31:55,030 --> 02:32:01,879
Yeah. New

1732
02:32:01,879 --> 02:32:05,340
skills.

1733
02:32:05,340 --> 02:32:07,340
Oh boy there's a skill tree.

1734
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:09,829
Spend skill points

1735
02:32:09,829 --> 02:32:11,829
in the skill menu. New combat styles can be

1736
02:32:11,829 --> 02:32:13,829
learned through obtaining texts for each

1737
02:32:13,829 --> 02:32:16,389
style.

1738
02:32:16,389 --> 02:32:18,389
There are three types. Combat

1739
02:32:18,389 --> 02:32:20,389
arts, shinobi martial arts,

1740
02:32:20,389 --> 02:32:22,950
and latent skills.

1741
02:32:22,950 --> 02:32:24,950
Combat arts must be equipped to be used

1742
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:26,950
in combat. Shinobi martial arts and latent skills are always

1743
02:32:26,950 --> 02:32:28,950
in effect upon being acquired.

1744
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:33,500
So this is a

1745
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:35,500
combat art. Whirlwind slash.

1746
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:44,389
So this is available. This is not

1747
02:32:44,389 --> 02:32:48,420
available. Counter thrust

1748
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:50,790
attacks. This is all. I guess

1749
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:55,139
I'm just gonna do this.

1750
02:32:55,139 --> 02:32:59,690
Why wouldn't I just get this right now?

1751
02:32:59,690 --> 02:33:04,170
Whirlwind slash. But do I only get

1752
02:33:04,170 --> 02:33:06,170
a certain amount of these books?

1753
02:33:06,170 --> 02:33:12,309
Or points or something.

1754
02:33:12,309 --> 02:33:14,309
Enables one to counter enemy thrust attacks by

1755
02:33:14,309 --> 02:33:16,309
stomping down on an enemy's weapon.

1756
02:33:16,309 --> 02:33:18,680
Nearly impossible to perceive the speed

1757
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:20,680
of a thrust, but not for the sharp eyes of

1758
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:24,200
a shinobi.

1759
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:28,739
Okay. I'm just gonna

1760
02:33:28,739 --> 02:33:32,649
get the first one. So how do I do

1761
02:33:32,649 --> 02:33:34,649
that? Maybe I can go back to the training guy?

1762
02:33:34,649 --> 02:33:42,200
I like the idea of hitting multiple

1763
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:49,690
people. Okay combat arts are special

1764
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:51,690
attack skills based on the strengths of the fighting

1765
02:33:51,690 --> 02:33:53,690
style they belong to. They

1766
02:33:53,690 --> 02:33:55,690
must be equipped in the equipment menu.

1767
02:33:55,690 --> 02:33:58,760
And can be learned

1768
02:33:58,760 --> 02:34:00,760
through the skill menu or found in special texts.

1769
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:03,129
So left trigger

1770
02:34:03,129 --> 02:34:05,129
while holding. Right trigger while holding

1771
02:34:05,129 --> 02:34:07,129
left trigger is the

1772
02:34:07,129 --> 02:34:11,540
combat art. Let's go put it on.

1773
02:34:11,540 --> 02:34:15,000
You can only have one on at a time.

1774
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,940
Oh there it is. Okay.

1775
02:34:17,940 --> 02:34:22,360
So it's

1776
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:25,559
just both at the same time.

1777
02:34:25,559 --> 02:34:29,850
Alright so you can hold it. Just

1778
02:34:29,850 --> 02:34:31,850
hold it and bang. It doesn't

1779
02:34:31,850 --> 02:34:33,850
cost anything.

1780
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:35,850
That's a pretty cool move though. That's actually

1781
02:34:35,850 --> 02:34:37,850
fantastic. I'm gonna love that. I'm gonna

1782
02:34:37,850 --> 02:34:41,500
love it. Somebody said play conquer

1783
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:44,440
is bad for a day.

1784
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:49,239
No.

1785
02:34:49,239 --> 02:34:51,239
Like right now?

1786
02:34:51,239 --> 02:34:53,239
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1787
02:34:53,239 --> 02:35:00,649
Hirata Estate.

1788
02:35:00,649 --> 02:35:02,649
I feel like I probably shouldn't be

1789
02:35:02,649 --> 02:35:04,649
here right now. But for the sake

1790
02:35:04,649 --> 02:35:06,649
of just seeing what's here I'm gonna go over here.

1791
02:35:06,649 --> 02:35:24,229
Can I go up? No. Guy

1792
02:35:24,229 --> 02:35:26,229
right there. I gotta try my

1793
02:35:26,229 --> 02:35:33,850
new move on somebody.

1794
02:35:33,850 --> 02:35:35,850
Oh this is somebody. I don't even know how it works.

1795
02:35:35,850 --> 02:35:38,659
I'm just starting to barely

1796
02:35:38,659 --> 02:35:40,659
understand the mechanics of the game.

1797
02:35:40,659 --> 02:35:51,030
Sorry. Alright. Anybody

1798
02:35:51,030 --> 02:35:53,030
over there? I could probably sneak up on

1799
02:35:53,030 --> 02:35:57,379
this dude. Well I'm not gonna sneak up

1800
02:35:57,379 --> 02:35:59,379
on that guy.

1801
02:35:59,379 --> 02:36:03,909
Should have paid more attention.

1802
02:36:03,909 --> 02:36:05,909
Dowsing Powder. Treating burns.

1803
02:36:05,909 --> 02:36:10,069
Reduces burn damage

1804
02:36:10,069 --> 02:36:12,069
and

1805
02:36:12,069 --> 02:36:14,069
you put it all over here and it makes you not

1806
02:36:14,069 --> 02:36:16,950
be burned. Let's go.

1807
02:36:16,950 --> 02:36:24,569
What a dude. Alright.

1808
02:36:24,569 --> 02:36:30,579
Nice job.

1809
02:36:30,579 --> 02:36:34,489
I'll give you credit. You did try to burn it.

1810
02:36:34,489 --> 02:36:38,260
Wait!

1811
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:40,260
No it's not. Oh my god.

1812
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:48,069
My whole body hurts.

1813
02:36:48,069 --> 02:36:50,069
Thank god you can't die by going in the water

1814
02:36:50,069 --> 02:36:52,950
in this game. I'm pressing A instead

1815
02:36:52,950 --> 02:36:54,950
of Y to pick shit up. Look at this thing.

1816
02:36:54,950 --> 02:37:00,329
I don't

1817
02:37:00,329 --> 02:37:02,329
know. Look at how big this turtle's

1818
02:37:02,329 --> 02:37:04,329
neck is. No that's not alive.

1819
02:37:04,329 --> 02:37:06,329
I thought that turtle was alive.

1820
02:37:06,329 --> 02:37:08,329
I was gonna say that is a fucked up looking

1821
02:37:08,329 --> 02:37:21,639
turtle. Can I...I can't...

1822
02:37:21,639 --> 02:37:31,479
Tre...Treasure Carp

1823
02:37:31,479 --> 02:37:35,260
Scale. Wait this is the

1824
02:37:35,260 --> 02:37:37,260
cookie bug. This is the new

1825
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:39,260
bug from...Alright.

1826
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:50,069
Bring it to somebody who knows what they're doing

1827
02:37:50,069 --> 02:37:52,069
and you can...Alright that's cool.

1828
02:37:52,069 --> 02:37:54,069
So it's a cookie fish now.

1829
02:37:54,069 --> 02:38:02,440
Look at that. Wouldn't even come over here

1830
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:04,440
if it wasn't for the cookie fish.

1831
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:10,950
Another one. Nice.

1832
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:12,950
How far can you go? Is there an invisible wall?

1833
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:18,950
Yeah.

1834
02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:30,020
Look at the other side. I don't think I can make it up there.

1835
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:34,120
You can't grab that ledge? Yes

1836
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:36,120
you can. You can't.

1837
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:49,479
What are you dumb? Did I miss anything

1838
02:38:49,479 --> 02:38:55,559
over here? There's more shit over there though.

1839
02:38:55,559 --> 02:38:58,819
What are you dumb?

1840
02:38:58,819 --> 02:39:04,760
Let me get down here first.

1841
02:39:04,760 --> 02:39:06,760
There's like pirate boats over here with items.

1842
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:09,000
Huh? Who?

1843
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Oh. You. Alright fine. Come down here.

1844
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,350
Okay. Two seconds. Are you gonna come over here

1845
02:39:15,350 --> 02:39:17,350
or...You're not gonna aggro everyone

1846
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:20,360
by doing this right? That'd be really

1847
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:22,360
bad. Please don't.

1848
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:33,610
You lost me. Good. That's a big

1849
02:39:33,610 --> 02:39:37,959
animal. Regular dog?

1850
02:39:37,959 --> 02:39:41,420
Just regular dog.

1851
02:39:41,420 --> 02:39:45,370
This guy's still finding

1852
02:39:45,370 --> 02:39:50,940
me. There's no fashion

1853
02:39:50,940 --> 02:39:52,940
Sekiro. Well that's

1854
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:56,260
unfortunate. I'm one of these

1855
02:39:59,270 --> 02:40:06,379
magic find items.

1856
02:40:06,379 --> 02:40:14,250
I'm intrigued to go check over here.

1857
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:21,670
Can I get up there? No? Could you

1858
02:40:21,670 --> 02:40:23,670
effectively just go all the way around and skip the whole thing?

1859
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:32,950
Another coin purse.

1860
02:40:32,950 --> 02:40:34,950
Ooh! Secret fish.

1861
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:46,899
No! No!

1862
02:40:46,899 --> 02:40:48,899
That was brutal. Who just? Was the fish just talking

1863
02:40:48,899 --> 02:41:05,459
to me?

1864
02:41:05,459 --> 02:41:09,750
Why? What?

1865
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:18,069
Oh creepy.

1866
02:41:18,069 --> 02:41:23,430
Purchase items with scales.

1867
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:27,020
Mask fragment.

1868
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:30,469
Withered red

1869
02:41:30,469 --> 02:41:33,479
gourd.

1870
02:41:33,479 --> 02:41:35,479
Curved withered red gourd filled with medicinal water.

1871
02:41:35,479 --> 02:41:37,479
The gourd's medicine refills upon

1872
02:41:37,479 --> 02:41:40,299
rest. Reduces burn

1873
02:41:40,299 --> 02:41:42,299
buildup and slightly increases burn resistance.

1874
02:41:42,299 --> 02:41:44,299
It cannot heal the burn status

1875
02:41:44,299 --> 02:41:50,680
of its

1876
02:41:50,680 --> 02:41:54,709
divine grass. So this is a full

1877
02:41:54,709 --> 02:42:02,069
heal. So

1878
02:42:02,069 --> 02:42:08,020
this is a consumable though.

1879
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:10,020
It's a scale to eat this and it's gone.

1880
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:17,190
The original must have been broken

1881
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:19,190
into several pieces and this fragment appears to be

1882
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:21,190
the right side of the mask.

1883
02:42:21,190 --> 02:42:27,590
So this is a combat art floating passage.

1884
02:42:27,590 --> 02:42:29,959
Unleash attacks in a flowing

1885
02:42:29,959 --> 02:42:31,959
dance-like form, overwhelming enemies

1886
02:42:31,959 --> 02:42:34,520
in a furor of

1887
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:42,389
graceful aggression.

1888
02:42:42,389 --> 02:42:49,370
What does the mask do? No idea.

1889
02:42:49,370 --> 02:42:51,370
Bring me some scales next time.

1890
02:42:51,370 --> 02:42:53,370
No Wikipedia to help us.

1891
02:42:53,370 --> 02:42:56,950
We just gotta play.

1892
02:42:56,950 --> 02:43:02,840
That's really cool though. What a cool character.

1893
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:09,049
Uh, fish?

1894
02:43:09,049 --> 02:43:13,459
What was it? I just got

1895
02:43:13,459 --> 02:43:17,110
What was it? Did I lose my opportunity?

1896
02:43:17,110 --> 02:43:29,379
I gotta get out of the water.

1897
02:43:29,379 --> 02:43:31,379
Who is aggroing to me?

1898
02:43:31,379 --> 02:43:42,840
Let's get up here.

1899
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:49,559
No I can't.

1900
02:43:49,559 --> 02:43:52,819
There it is. There it is.

1901
02:43:52,819 --> 02:43:57,299
Come here. Come on.

1902
02:43:57,299 --> 02:44:00,700
No. Damn it.

1903
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:04,090
I gotta get up here and just wait.

1904
02:44:04,090 --> 02:44:12,459
Come on.

1905
02:44:12,459 --> 02:44:16,360
I need to kill you. You gotta come on.

1906
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:21,219
Fishing quest. I know.

1907
02:44:21,219 --> 02:44:32,340
Really. There it is.

1908
02:44:32,340 --> 02:44:36,760
He's not at the surface though. I think he used to

1909
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:38,760
actually pop up because I can't really hit him.

1910
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:47,659
Drive the shuriken.

1911
02:44:47,659 --> 02:44:49,659
That's a good idea.

1912
02:44:49,659 --> 02:44:58,489
Because he's deep down there.

1913
02:44:58,489 --> 02:45:01,110
It just makes him go

1914
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:09,750
real fast. I might just have to watch him

1915
02:45:09,750 --> 02:45:13,270
wait until he gets up. Hopefully he comes

1916
02:45:13,270 --> 02:45:18,200
back. It seems like he'll have to come

1917
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:20,200
up a little higher to the surface.

1918
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:35,030
Back? Just wait.

1919
02:45:35,030 --> 02:45:40,260
He gets a little closer.

1920
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:42,260
I'm gonna leap out and smash him.

1921
02:45:42,260 --> 02:45:54,860
Wait, wait, wait.

1922
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:58,629
Wait.

1923
02:45:58,629 --> 02:46:10,840
Come on. Just scream and charge him.

1924
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:14,360
That's not gonna work.

1925
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:16,729
Come to London. I've always wanted to

1926
02:46:16,729 --> 02:46:21,020
go to Europe. I'm not sure he's gonna get up.

1927
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:27,979
He's gonna be right here.

1928
02:46:27,979 --> 02:46:29,979
Here we go. Here we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1929
02:46:29,979 --> 02:46:33,049
Fuck no. What?

1930
02:46:33,049 --> 02:46:37,659
How do I swing down?

1931
02:46:37,659 --> 02:46:45,780
I couldn't get it.

1932
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:47,780
It's almost like I see him

1933
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:49,780
slashing this way. I don't think you can

1934
02:46:49,780 --> 02:46:54,260
do that. Is there a way I can

1935
02:46:54,260 --> 02:46:56,569
swing down?

1936
02:46:56,569 --> 02:46:59,559
Maybe like that.

1937
02:46:59,559 --> 02:47:02,379
I hit the rod.

1938
02:47:02,379 --> 02:47:07,110
I don't buy that. Let me try doing that

1939
02:47:07,110 --> 02:47:15,750
combat art too. Come on.

1940
02:47:15,750 --> 02:47:17,750
I have to catch this fish. It's gonna drive me crazy.

1941
02:47:17,750 --> 02:47:19,750
There he is. Alright.

1942
02:47:19,750 --> 02:47:28,649
I'm gonna do the combat art too. I can't even see him.

1943
02:47:28,649 --> 02:47:30,649
I might have to just wait a little longer.

1944
02:47:30,649 --> 02:47:36,920
Just wait even longer.

1945
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:38,920
He goes by here. He starts to come up a little bit.

1946
02:47:38,920 --> 02:47:47,500
This is just a fishing stream.

1947
02:47:47,500 --> 02:47:49,500
At the moment, yeah.

1948
02:47:51,799 --> 02:47:55,899
Alright. This is what happened last time.

1949
02:47:55,899 --> 02:47:59,799
He came up a little.

1950
02:47:59,799 --> 02:48:02,229
I saw it at him. Everybody just don't move.

1951
02:48:02,229 --> 02:48:13,100
Where'd he go?

1952
02:48:13,100 --> 02:48:21,459
Where'd he go? What?

1953
02:48:21,459 --> 02:48:23,459
Oh shit. How did he go by me?

1954
02:48:23,459 --> 02:48:28,899
Shallow water.

1955
02:48:28,899 --> 02:48:33,370
Fuck it. I'm going for it.

1956
02:48:33,370 --> 02:48:35,860
Got him. Nice.

1957
02:48:35,860 --> 02:48:38,489
Alright. Cool. I feel

1958
02:48:38,489 --> 02:48:40,489
complete.

1959
02:48:40,489 --> 02:48:46,309
Shut up, Oscar.

1960
02:48:46,309 --> 02:48:50,340
There might be another one.

1961
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:55,530
Might as well check, right?

1962
02:48:55,530 --> 02:49:04,229
I can't see anymore.

1963
02:49:04,229 --> 02:49:12,979
There was one under here.

1964
02:49:12,979 --> 02:49:14,979
I'm gonna get the great rod. There is no great rod.

1965
02:49:14,979 --> 02:49:19,659
Just the great rod.

1966
02:49:19,659 --> 02:49:23,299
That's a lot of dogs up there.

1967
02:49:23,299 --> 02:49:25,299
I think I'm gonna just pull this guy.

1968
02:49:25,299 --> 02:49:27,299
No. How am I gonna effectively do this?

1969
02:49:27,299 --> 02:49:30,629
I gotta go around.

1970
02:49:30,629 --> 02:49:35,180
I just got three dogs with me.

1971
02:49:35,180 --> 02:49:38,629
Have I thought about visiting Singapore?

1972
02:49:38,629 --> 02:49:40,629
I wanna go everywhere.

1973
02:49:40,629 --> 02:49:42,629
But I wanna turn like 40 first.

1974
02:49:42,629 --> 02:49:44,809
You know? I wanna be one of those boomers

1975
02:49:44,809 --> 02:49:46,809
that just travels the world when he's like 45.

1976
02:49:46,809 --> 02:50:01,020
The guy with the three dogs

1977
02:50:01,020 --> 02:50:03,020
is right up here.

1978
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:08,579
Maybe fighting's not the answer sometimes.

1979
02:50:08,579 --> 02:50:18,180
I can't grab that from here.

1980
02:50:18,180 --> 02:50:21,379
Okay. Here's the plan. Ready?

1981
02:50:21,379 --> 02:50:24,069
I'm gonna go in. I'm gonna do the weapon art

1982
02:50:24,069 --> 02:50:26,069
to all the dogs at the same time.

1983
02:50:26,069 --> 02:50:42,579
Nobody sees me yet. Perfect.

1984
02:50:42,579 --> 02:50:45,139
Oh shit.

1985
02:50:45,139 --> 02:50:47,139
That's the burn meter.

1986
02:50:47,139 --> 02:50:49,319
He got me with the burn. Really?

1987
02:50:49,319 --> 02:50:51,319
I'm burning now.

1988
02:50:51,319 --> 02:50:53,319
Fuck. Yeah.

1989
02:50:53,319 --> 02:50:55,319
I touched every...

1990
02:50:55,319 --> 02:50:57,319
Oh. I'm so mad about that.

1991
02:50:57,319 --> 02:51:03,340
Yeah. Resistance gauge.

1992
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:05,340
There are two items which suppress the gauge

1993
02:51:05,340 --> 02:51:07,340
and cure, and I'm on fire.

1994
02:51:07,340 --> 02:51:10,920
I don't think I can get rid of this

1995
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:12,920
until... How long does this last?

1996
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:15,860
I dodged into every single one of those

1997
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:18,100
somehow. It's definitely not that bad.

1998
02:51:18,100 --> 02:51:26,299
Enemies doused in oil easily set alight

1999
02:51:26,299 --> 02:51:28,299
causing them to take additional vitality

2000
02:51:28,299 --> 02:51:30,299
even from fire attacks.

2001
02:51:30,299 --> 02:51:32,920
Oil and they burn.

2002
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:36,940
You got it.

2003
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:39,430
Now, let me just get rid of this guy too.

2004
02:51:39,430 --> 02:51:51,850
I love games where stomping and dropping

2005
02:51:51,850 --> 02:51:53,850
actually works. Yeah.

2006
02:51:53,850 --> 02:51:56,149
And then it's pretty cool.

2007
02:51:56,149 --> 02:52:10,219
Nothing else.

2008
02:52:10,219 --> 02:52:12,219
I completely forgot this is almost a secondary

2009
02:52:12,219 --> 02:52:16,950
area that I don't have to be in right now.

2010
02:52:16,950 --> 02:52:18,950
My brain...

2011
02:52:18,950 --> 02:52:20,950
This is the next part of the game in my brain.

2012
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:24,469
Why did I press down? Maybe it is.

2013
02:52:24,469 --> 02:52:39,000
Let's take a rest.

2014
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:48,659
I'm good. 59 out of 15.

2015
02:52:48,659 --> 02:52:51,219
More ceramic shards.

2016
02:52:51,219 --> 02:52:54,229
Alright.

2017
02:52:56,229 --> 02:52:58,229
Is he screaming to let

2018
02:52:58,229 --> 02:53:00,229
everybody in or... That's a big

2019
02:53:00,229 --> 02:53:02,229
yell, right? Okay. Well, whatever.

2020
02:53:02,229 --> 02:53:04,790
Just come over here.

2021
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:07,159
Is he opening the door? That door just

2022
02:53:07,159 --> 02:53:21,049
can't open. They just know that something's

2023
02:53:21,049 --> 02:53:23,049
going on over here. They can't do anything about it though.

2024
02:53:23,049 --> 02:53:26,739
I'm fine with that. Alright. Let's get out.

2025
02:53:26,739 --> 02:53:34,299
Alright. Any enemies down here?

2026
02:53:34,299 --> 02:53:38,700
No. Let's just check.

2027
02:53:38,700 --> 02:53:45,209
Ladder. Wall.

2028
02:53:45,209 --> 02:53:50,329
Just an item on a tree.

2029
02:53:50,329 --> 02:53:52,329
Ooh, thanks. I don't even know what it was.

2030
02:53:52,329 --> 02:54:04,540
What the hell was it?

2031
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:06,540
You are so infected.

2032
02:54:06,540 --> 02:54:10,250
What? You mean me in real

2033
02:54:10,250 --> 02:54:12,250
life? I would agree with you. Something's wrong with me.

2034
02:54:12,250 --> 02:54:14,680
There's more sugar.

2035
02:54:14,680 --> 02:54:17,750
So this is... You take less damage.

2036
02:54:17,750 --> 02:54:19,750
This is just the damaged candy.

2037
02:54:19,750 --> 02:54:22,180
Three... Okay. It's in storage.

2038
02:54:22,180 --> 02:54:25,059
I need to save those

2039
02:54:25,059 --> 02:54:27,059
for bosses. I'm not taking those during regular

2040
02:54:27,059 --> 02:54:37,299
encounters. You want me to jump?

2041
02:54:37,299 --> 02:54:44,659
The only point of entry is up

2042
02:54:44,659 --> 02:54:47,670
here. So...

2043
02:54:47,670 --> 02:54:50,549
Remember I can go that way.

2044
02:54:50,549 --> 02:54:54,569
Ooh.

2045
02:54:54,569 --> 02:54:57,450
Let's be easy. Let's be easy.

2046
02:54:57,450 --> 02:55:02,700
Easy. Easy. Can I e-drop?

2047
02:55:02,700 --> 02:55:07,219
These guys talk to each other?

2048
02:55:07,219 --> 02:55:09,590
Who's more dangerous? I don't know.

2049
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:22,010
Guy with the bow. Somebody's

2050
02:55:22,010 --> 02:55:32,629
looking at me. I left my favorite

2051
02:55:32,629 --> 02:55:34,629
YouTuber streamer.

2052
02:55:34,629 --> 02:55:37,190
I think it's streamer now.

2053
02:55:37,190 --> 02:55:42,229
Almost exclusively.

2054
02:55:42,229 --> 02:55:46,840
Doesn't open from this side. For now.

2055
02:55:46,840 --> 02:55:49,979
Streamtuber.

2056
02:55:49,979 --> 02:55:53,670
Um... Three.

2057
02:55:53,670 --> 02:55:57,319
Guy with the burn. That looks like

2058
02:55:57,319 --> 02:55:59,319
a shortcut. I wonder...

2059
02:55:59,319 --> 02:56:04,760
Let's go up this way.

2060
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:07,190
Can I climb there?

2061
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:09,620
I'll go down this way. Let's go.

2062
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:12,760
Watch this. Ready? This is gonna be

2063
02:56:12,760 --> 02:56:25,930
so cool. Nevermind. More

2064
02:56:25,930 --> 02:56:31,370
sugar. Boosts attack power.

2065
02:56:31,370 --> 02:56:34,500
So this is a...

2066
02:56:34,500 --> 02:56:36,500
The fighting... The red sugar

2067
02:56:36,500 --> 02:56:39,260
is the fight sugar.

2068
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:45,590
Wait. What's that? Three people.

2069
02:56:45,590 --> 02:56:47,590
Ah. Easy.

2070
02:56:47,590 --> 02:56:50,899
Climb up there. Come on. Give me a

2071
02:56:50,899 --> 02:56:56,920
point of access. Got no

2072
02:56:56,920 --> 02:57:02,040
access right there to climb? Come

2073
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:04,219
on. How? There's gotta be

2074
02:57:04,219 --> 02:57:09,399
something I can jump up to. Not even the

2075
02:57:09,399 --> 02:57:11,829
tree? You're killing me.

2076
02:57:11,829 --> 02:57:25,780
I don't know what I'm doing right now,

2077
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:27,780
but it's stupid, whatever it is.

2078
02:57:27,780 --> 02:57:39,799
I was just trying to

2079
02:57:39,799 --> 02:57:48,819
find a place to grapple.

2080
02:57:48,819 --> 02:57:50,819
I can't get on this house.

2081
02:57:50,819 --> 02:57:52,819
I thought I could. Alright, let's just talk.

2082
02:57:52,819 --> 02:57:55,450
Because you just gotta go in.

2083
02:57:55,450 --> 02:58:11,110
Watch out for this guy.

2084
02:58:18,600 --> 02:58:21,159
You're almost broken. That's great.

2085
02:58:21,159 --> 02:58:24,870
That was a Smash Brothers sound effect?

2086
02:58:24,870 --> 02:58:28,260
I don't even know what you're

2087
02:58:28,260 --> 02:58:33,750
talking about.

2088
02:58:33,750 --> 02:58:39,379
Some pellets. Good.

2089
02:58:39,379 --> 02:58:45,000
That'll help. They were dogs

2090
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:56,260
though. Thought I could get over

2091
02:58:56,260 --> 02:58:58,260
there. Thought I could be cheeky about that.

2092
02:58:58,260 --> 02:59:10,229
Whoa!

2093
02:59:10,229 --> 02:59:12,729
I'm stuck on something there.

2094
02:59:12,729 --> 02:59:14,969
Did that guy just say waza?

2095
02:59:14,969 --> 02:59:16,969
Like the old Budweiser commercial?

2096
02:59:16,969 --> 02:59:31,370
Ooh! That hurts.

2097
02:59:31,370 --> 02:59:33,799
Alright.

2098
02:59:33,799 --> 02:59:35,799
Oh no, no, no.

2099
02:59:35,799 --> 02:59:48,149
Bad. Very bad.

2100
02:59:48,149 --> 02:59:51,930
Relax. This guy with a

2101
02:59:51,930 --> 02:59:59,989
bow and arrow or something over here.

2102
02:59:59,989 --> 03:00:01,989
I gotta go. I'm back on top of the house, please.

2103
03:00:01,989 --> 03:00:04,299
Actually, maybe not.

2104
03:00:04,299 --> 03:00:07,049
That's probably bad. I don't know.

2105
03:00:07,049 --> 03:00:09,049
I need to get the item in here.

2106
03:00:09,049 --> 03:00:11,049
Oh, come on.

2107
03:00:11,049 --> 03:00:25,770
With this accuracy.

2108
03:00:25,770 --> 03:00:28,649
I'm talking on the roof. Alright.

2109
03:00:28,649 --> 03:00:30,950
Fuck this guy.

2110
03:00:30,950 --> 03:00:56,680
Where are you locking on, game?

2111
03:00:56,680 --> 03:01:01,610
Holy shit,

2112
03:01:01,610 --> 03:01:13,829
a lot of people. Easy.

2113
03:01:17,030 --> 03:01:19,979
Fuck.

2114
03:01:19,979 --> 03:01:21,979
Just trying to do the art.

2115
03:01:28,860 --> 03:01:33,979
Ah!

2116
03:01:33,979 --> 03:01:40,250
Damn it, I didn't time it right.

2117
03:01:40,250 --> 03:01:42,250
That guy was shit-faced.

2118
03:01:42,250 --> 03:01:47,989
Yeah, he was pretty drunk.

2119
03:01:47,989 --> 03:01:50,360
Although, I'm kind of hurting for

2120
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:58,659
health here.

2121
03:01:58,659 --> 03:02:05,129
Just one more guy, I think.

2122
03:02:05,129 --> 03:02:11,399
I feel bad for that guy.

2123
03:02:11,399 --> 03:02:13,399
But still, sometimes you gotta...

2124
03:02:13,399 --> 03:02:17,940
I hear another dog somewhere.

2125
03:02:17,940 --> 03:02:23,000
Burn powder.

2126
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:27,139
In this room? No.

2127
03:02:27,139 --> 03:02:34,360
Okay, there we go. Pellet.

2128
03:02:34,360 --> 03:02:36,600
More items. Couple here.

2129
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:38,899
This is the money pellet.

2130
03:02:38,899 --> 03:02:40,899
Flame barrel.

2131
03:02:40,899 --> 03:02:42,899
An iron barrel that spews fire?

2132
03:02:42,899 --> 03:02:44,899
Ooh! A new prosthetic.

2133
03:02:44,899 --> 03:02:48,489
It's difficult to control

2134
03:02:48,489 --> 03:02:50,489
the rage-filled red eyes

2135
03:02:50,489 --> 03:02:52,489
with the power of man alone.

2136
03:02:52,489 --> 03:02:54,489
A fire-based weapon could be a means of resisting them.

2137
03:02:54,489 --> 03:02:56,489
They're said to fear fire

2138
03:02:56,489 --> 03:03:03,020
above all else.

2139
03:03:03,020 --> 03:03:06,280
Well, I now have a new

2140
03:03:06,280 --> 03:03:13,829
toy to play with. I'm gonna heal.

2141
03:03:13,829 --> 03:03:21,260
There's another item over here.

2142
03:03:21,260 --> 03:03:25,989
I haven't used this once.

2143
03:03:25,989 --> 03:03:28,420
Just see what it does.

2144
03:03:28,420 --> 03:03:30,420
Every time I play one of these games, I just never use

2145
03:03:30,420 --> 03:03:32,420
the items that they give me.

2146
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:34,420
And I end up with a thousand of them in my inventory.

2147
03:03:34,420 --> 03:03:41,319
Keep going.

2148
03:03:41,319 --> 03:03:45,219
Let's see what it does.

2149
03:03:45,219 --> 03:03:47,780
Looks like a distractor. That's actually

2150
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:50,020
really good.

2151
03:03:50,020 --> 03:04:03,579
Phenomenal, actually.

2152
03:04:03,579 --> 03:04:07,739
Oh.

2153
03:04:07,739 --> 03:04:10,299
Worthless bastards.

2154
03:04:10,299 --> 03:04:12,299
Hello.

2155
03:04:12,299 --> 03:04:14,729
You are...

2156
03:04:14,729 --> 03:04:16,969
a shinobi, if...

2157
03:04:16,969 --> 03:04:18,969
if I have mistaken.

2158
03:04:18,969 --> 03:04:20,969
Take the shinobi axe

2159
03:04:20,969 --> 03:04:23,590
from the temple

2160
03:04:23,590 --> 03:04:26,729
and split it into

2161
03:04:26,729 --> 03:04:28,729
skulls wide open.

2162
03:04:28,729 --> 03:04:31,479
Please.

2163
03:04:31,479 --> 03:04:35,579
For a second, I thought you said, like, hug him.

2164
03:04:35,579 --> 03:04:37,879
Oh, okay.

2165
03:04:37,879 --> 03:04:39,879
Sorry that you died.

2166
03:04:39,879 --> 03:04:52,469
See anything?

2167
03:04:52,469 --> 03:04:56,379
Will he see me if I pop out here?

2168
03:04:56,379 --> 03:04:58,680
What is that?

2169
03:04:58,680 --> 03:05:03,670
Oh, he's trolling.

2170
03:05:10,680 --> 03:05:13,370
Alright, so something going on in there.

2171
03:05:17,370 --> 03:05:28,440
I'm gonna kill these guys.

2172
03:05:28,440 --> 03:05:30,440
There's more stuff over here, too.

2173
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:32,440
There's an NPC over there. Alright, wait.

2174
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:35,129
Let me get the... there's an item this way.

2175
03:05:35,129 --> 03:05:40,059
Let me just get up there.

2176
03:05:40,059 --> 03:05:47,350
Pick it up. Whatever it is.

2177
03:05:47,350 --> 03:05:55,479
Chicken. Another sugar.

2178
03:05:55,479 --> 03:05:58,620
So this reduces posture damage

2179
03:05:58,620 --> 03:06:02,139
taken. There's a lot of these candies.

2180
03:06:09,620 --> 03:06:11,620
Ah, hey, look at that.

2181
03:06:11,620 --> 03:06:13,799
I did it. I opened up

2182
03:06:13,799 --> 03:06:18,540
the shortcut. Remember this?

2183
03:06:18,540 --> 03:06:31,719
I remember.

2184
03:06:31,719 --> 03:06:35,370
Let's go

2185
03:06:35,370 --> 03:06:37,370
refill our stuff.

2186
03:06:37,370 --> 03:06:45,860
I also kind of want to...

2187
03:06:45,860 --> 03:06:47,860
I want to go see what this new toy

2188
03:06:47,860 --> 03:06:58,790
is. New toy?

2189
03:06:58,790 --> 03:07:05,639
Yeah.

2190
03:07:36,569 --> 03:07:39,450
That's how you go lucid, man.

2191
03:07:39,450 --> 03:07:42,260
Hey, next time you're in that

2192
03:07:42,260 --> 03:07:44,260
zone, look in a mirror

2193
03:07:44,260 --> 03:07:46,500
to get even more lucid.

2194
03:07:46,500 --> 03:07:48,500
Flip a couple of light switches. Look at a clock.

2195
03:07:48,500 --> 03:07:50,500
You'll get deeper into lucidity.

2196
03:07:50,500 --> 03:07:58,440
Actually, by the way, don't ever look at a mirror

2197
03:07:58,440 --> 03:08:00,440
if you're in a dream. It's terrifying.

2198
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:02,440
You look like the Scream monster.

2199
03:08:02,440 --> 03:08:04,440
The guy from Scream with the Scream mask on.

2200
03:08:04,440 --> 03:08:06,440
It's horrible. Your brain doesn't

2201
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:08,440
understand how to decipher

2202
03:08:08,440 --> 03:08:10,440
a mirror if you're in a dream. Try it.

2203
03:08:10,440 --> 03:08:12,440
If you want to be scared.

2204
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:17,180
Alright, deals fire,

2205
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:19,180
damage to enemies in a short range blast

2206
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:22,120
while burning.

2207
03:08:22,120 --> 03:08:25,190
So let's create it.

2208
03:08:25,190 --> 03:08:33,319
I can have three of these, right? You've never seen

2209
03:08:33,319 --> 03:08:35,319
a mirror in your dream? I'm telling you, if you want

2210
03:08:35,319 --> 03:08:37,319
to scare the shit out of yourself,

2211
03:08:37,319 --> 03:08:39,690
if you ever find yourself lucid

2212
03:08:39,690 --> 03:08:41,690
in a dream, go look in a mirror.

2213
03:08:41,690 --> 03:08:45,719
You will probably immediately wake up

2214
03:08:45,719 --> 03:08:50,459
because it's going to be a horror movie.

2215
03:08:50,459 --> 03:08:52,459
Okay, let's see.

2216
03:08:52,459 --> 03:08:55,850
Let's equip it. So this

2217
03:08:55,850 --> 03:08:57,850
costs three spirit emblems.

2218
03:08:57,850 --> 03:08:59,850
Whoa.

2219
03:08:59,850 --> 03:09:04,309
That's cool.

2220
03:09:04,309 --> 03:09:11,860
I kind of want to just try it. It's a cool way to switch.

2221
03:09:11,860 --> 03:09:17,860
Alright.

2222
03:09:17,860 --> 03:09:26,680
Back to it. Let's rest up.

2223
03:09:26,680 --> 03:09:30,329
Thermal lucid.

2224
03:09:30,329 --> 03:09:33,829
No.

2225
03:09:33,829 --> 03:09:35,829
What about skills? Okay, I can do...

2226
03:09:35,829 --> 03:09:39,799
Wait a minute. Mid-air

2227
03:09:39,799 --> 03:09:42,299
deflection. Allows one to

2228
03:09:42,299 --> 03:09:44,299
guard against or deflect enemy attacks

2229
03:09:44,299 --> 03:09:46,299
in mid-air.

2230
03:09:46,299 --> 03:09:51,479
That sounds pretty great. What's this one?

2231
03:09:51,479 --> 03:09:55,510
A Shinobi's Karma

2232
03:09:55,510 --> 03:10:00,569
body. Max spirit

2233
03:10:00,569 --> 03:10:04,219
emblems. Interesting.

2234
03:10:04,219 --> 03:10:07,670
What about down here? Let me look at what some

2235
03:10:07,670 --> 03:10:10,360
of these do. That's cool.

2236
03:10:10,360 --> 03:10:14,780
Run and slide. Allows one to

2237
03:10:14,780 --> 03:10:16,780
slide into a crouch position while

2238
03:10:16,780 --> 03:10:18,780
sprinting. Sprint through an

2239
03:10:18,780 --> 03:10:20,780
area and slide into cover or otherwise out

2240
03:10:20,780 --> 03:10:22,780
of view. Easily deceives

2241
03:10:22,780 --> 03:10:26,680
an enemy's eyes. Reduces an enemy's

2242
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:28,680
ability to perceive those who are in stealth.

2243
03:10:28,680 --> 03:10:32,389
I kind of like being able to deflect

2244
03:10:32,389 --> 03:10:34,819
in the air.

2245
03:10:34,819 --> 03:10:36,819
But I'm going to hold on.

2246
03:10:36,819 --> 03:10:47,190
Not yet.

2247
03:10:47,190 --> 03:10:49,370
Am I still in Anor Londo?

2248
03:10:49,370 --> 03:10:51,370
I don't know how you could classify

2249
03:10:51,370 --> 03:10:57,959
this area. You could classify

2250
03:10:57,959 --> 03:10:59,959
this area as...I'm not sure.

2251
03:10:59,959 --> 03:11:04,819
I'm going to try this move though.

2252
03:11:04,819 --> 03:11:07,639
Ready? Let's see what that

2253
03:11:07,639 --> 03:11:09,639
does. Short range, right?

2254
03:11:09,639 --> 03:11:16,299
So it's kind of just like a blast.

2255
03:11:16,299 --> 03:11:22,360
Pretty long line there too.

2256
03:11:26,840 --> 03:11:33,819
You've got to be

2257
03:11:33,819 --> 03:11:35,819
real close. That's...

2258
03:11:35,819 --> 03:11:37,819
It's a dodge. And then

2259
03:11:37,819 --> 03:11:39,819
from the dodge you've got to be ready to go

2260
03:11:39,819 --> 03:11:48,579
and get hit.

2261
03:11:48,579 --> 03:11:50,950
Alright, let's skip this.

2262
03:11:50,950 --> 03:11:52,950
He tried to backstep. Yeah, I did.

2263
03:11:52,950 --> 03:11:57,239
You're right. Alright, he's going to go through the door.

2264
03:11:57,239 --> 03:11:59,239
That's now open.

2265
03:11:59,239 --> 03:12:01,239
I can just probably sneak around here, right?

2266
03:12:01,239 --> 03:12:05,139
Don't need to fight anything.

2267
03:12:05,139 --> 03:12:07,639
There's your pyromancy. Yeah.

2268
03:12:07,639 --> 03:12:11,610
Pretty much. I can't get there from here.

2269
03:12:11,610 --> 03:12:15,959
Come on.

2270
03:12:15,959 --> 03:12:17,959
Come on. It's right there.

2271
03:12:17,959 --> 03:12:19,959
I can't reach the roof here.

2272
03:12:19,959 --> 03:12:21,959
What are you thinking?

2273
03:12:21,959 --> 03:12:25,540
Wait. Yes I can.

2274
03:12:25,540 --> 03:12:29,190
Game doesn't suck.

2275
03:12:29,190 --> 03:12:36,860
What do you know? We

2276
03:12:36,860 --> 03:12:43,829
carry on. Alright, there was an

2277
03:12:43,829 --> 03:12:46,840
NPC.

2278
03:12:46,840 --> 03:12:50,299
There's a chicken. Well, I'm

2279
03:12:50,299 --> 03:12:52,299
going to go over here.

2280
03:12:52,299 --> 03:13:12,649
I bumped into everything in his house.

2281
03:13:12,649 --> 03:13:15,209
He's just kind of standing there going

2282
03:13:15,209 --> 03:13:17,209
well, you know, somebody

2283
03:13:17,209 --> 03:13:19,209
fucked up my house. Destroyed all

2284
03:13:19,209 --> 03:13:21,209
my stuff.

2285
03:13:21,209 --> 03:13:26,440
Sucks. I don't even know

2286
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:38,090
what the hell he's looking at.

2287
03:13:38,090 --> 03:13:40,329
Way! Way!

2288
03:13:40,329 --> 03:13:48,840
Way!

2289
03:13:48,840 --> 03:13:50,840
Wait, you can come this way?

2290
03:13:59,989 --> 03:14:01,989
Somehow, instinctively, for no reason

2291
03:14:01,989 --> 03:14:03,989
started to try to attack with R1.

2292
03:14:03,989 --> 03:14:07,379
Which

2293
03:14:07,379 --> 03:14:09,379
that's a long time.

2294
03:14:09,379 --> 03:14:11,879
You are

2295
03:14:11,879 --> 03:14:13,879
hard to parry.

2296
03:14:13,879 --> 03:14:17,340
Jesus.

2297
03:14:24,889 --> 03:14:27,059
Oh my

2298
03:14:27,059 --> 03:14:29,059
Lord. Where? God. Come on.

2299
03:14:41,770 --> 03:14:53,030
Fuck me. I feel like trapped in the corner

2300
03:14:53,030 --> 03:14:55,030
over here. With two different elevations.

2301
03:14:55,030 --> 03:14:57,030
You know what I mean? Like boom, boom.

2302
03:14:57,030 --> 03:15:00,170
Oh, fuck off, game.

2303
03:15:00,170 --> 03:15:27,239
He's PG.

2304
03:15:27,239 --> 03:15:39,510
No, not right now.

2305
03:15:39,510 --> 03:15:42,329
What's in here? Ooh, a secret.

2306
03:15:42,329 --> 03:15:47,819
There's the axe.

2307
03:15:47,819 --> 03:15:49,819
Fuck off, game. Means game sucks.

2308
03:15:49,819 --> 03:15:52,379
No. It means fuck off

2309
03:15:52,379 --> 03:15:54,620
for that moment. I found the axe.

2310
03:15:54,620 --> 03:15:57,750
It's another tool. Less for cutting

2311
03:15:57,750 --> 03:15:59,750
and more for breaking things with its weight.

2312
03:15:59,750 --> 03:16:01,750
Once the favorite weapon of a shinobi, known as

2313
03:16:01,750 --> 03:16:03,750
the bounding monkey

2314
03:16:03,750 --> 03:16:05,750
of the sunken valley, he was lost along with his left

2315
03:16:05,750 --> 03:16:10,170
arm. Okay, so

2316
03:16:10,170 --> 03:16:12,860
there's another two tools here.

2317
03:16:12,860 --> 03:16:19,319
That's pretty cool. Wasn't there

2318
03:16:19,319 --> 03:16:21,319
somebody just walking over here looking at this?

2319
03:16:21,319 --> 03:16:24,010
It was an NPC.

2320
03:16:24,010 --> 03:16:28,790
Maybe not. Well, let's get rid of the

2321
03:16:28,790 --> 03:16:41,079
chicken. If I die to this chicken, I swear

2322
03:16:41,079 --> 03:16:47,540
to god.

2323
03:16:47,540 --> 03:16:50,100
You killed my brothers!

2324
03:16:50,100 --> 03:16:52,100
Don't make jokes here because I actually could die.

2325
03:16:52,100 --> 03:16:54,649
Oh, no.

2326
03:16:54,649 --> 03:16:56,649
So god damn it, please.

2327
03:16:56,649 --> 03:16:58,649
Please not the chicken. Please.

2328
03:16:58,649 --> 03:17:16,420
There's another one in there.

2329
03:17:16,420 --> 03:17:23,340
That's king chicken.

2330
03:17:23,340 --> 03:17:27,750
Do they live in this house?

2331
03:17:27,750 --> 03:17:29,750
Stop! You violated the law!

2332
03:17:29,750 --> 03:17:33,659
Can I stealth kill this chicken?

2333
03:17:33,659 --> 03:17:38,899
Come on,

2334
03:17:38,899 --> 03:17:40,899
let me stealth kill him.

2335
03:17:40,899 --> 03:17:51,340
No! Something has to be in this

2336
03:17:51,340 --> 03:17:58,120
house. Why would this be here?

2337
03:17:58,120 --> 03:18:02,409
There's nothing in the chicken house.

2338
03:18:02,409 --> 03:18:08,340
Really? Yes, there is.

2339
03:18:08,340 --> 03:18:21,020
More sugar. What about the people

2340
03:18:21,020 --> 03:18:23,020
that were back here?

2341
03:18:23,020 --> 03:18:27,500
I think they're still here. Yeah, see?

2342
03:18:27,500 --> 03:18:29,500
Okay. So this is the way to go

2343
03:18:29,500 --> 03:18:31,500
to progress. It's just straight through.

2344
03:18:31,500 --> 03:18:33,930
I cleaned up everything.

2345
03:18:33,930 --> 03:18:35,930
Now, speaking of cleaning,

2346
03:18:35,930 --> 03:18:38,100
let's clean up some

2347
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:40,469
braid matter off

2348
03:18:40,469 --> 03:18:45,079
of our sword.

2349
03:18:45,079 --> 03:19:09,979
What is that lit up for?

2350
03:19:09,979 --> 03:19:11,979
Amnesium?

2351
03:19:11,979 --> 03:19:17,020
He's not bad.

2352
03:19:17,020 --> 03:19:20,600
He's highly skilled.

2353
03:19:20,600 --> 03:19:22,600
Just let me do one more taken.

2354
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:24,600
Just one more, I swear. That'll be it.

2355
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:29,850
We can put it in

2356
03:19:29,850 --> 03:19:31,850
feudal Japan.

2357
03:19:31,850 --> 03:19:33,850
Please write the script. Please.

2358
03:19:33,850 --> 03:19:41,379
Yes.

2359
03:19:49,100 --> 03:19:51,100
We've got a blood-borne window NPC.

2360
03:19:56,040 --> 03:19:59,879
Trader. Hey.

2361
03:19:59,879 --> 03:20:02,379
You. You're the young master

2362
03:20:02,379 --> 03:20:04,379
Shinobi. Yes.

2363
03:20:04,379 --> 03:20:07,190
What good are you? Wait.

2364
03:20:07,190 --> 03:20:09,190
Tell me you didn't leave. The timing of their

2365
03:20:09,190 --> 03:20:11,430
attack was perfect. Yes.

2366
03:20:11,430 --> 03:20:16,229
I hope. I would love if

2367
03:20:16,229 --> 03:20:18,229
you heard like...

2368
03:20:18,229 --> 03:20:20,860
And then it made like the soul collection

2369
03:20:20,860 --> 03:20:27,059
noise that like...

2370
03:20:27,059 --> 03:20:29,059
I hope you die

2371
03:20:29,059 --> 03:20:33,219
twice. I hope

2372
03:20:33,219 --> 03:20:35,219
you die twice.

2373
03:20:35,219 --> 03:20:39,959
Well,

2374
03:20:39,959 --> 03:20:41,959
let's see what's going on

2375
03:20:41,959 --> 03:20:46,549
over here.

2376
03:21:09,690 --> 03:21:12,819
Okay.

2377
03:21:12,819 --> 03:21:14,819
Okay.

2378
03:21:21,639 --> 03:21:24,579
Okay.

2379
03:21:32,040 --> 03:21:34,040
May the force be with you.

2380
03:21:34,040 --> 03:21:38,069
You as well. So everyone's kind of just

2381
03:21:38,069 --> 03:21:45,620
locked away right now.

2382
03:21:45,620 --> 03:21:47,620
And may the force be with you. And also with you.

2383
03:21:47,620 --> 03:21:50,309
Can I open the door?

2384
03:21:50,309 --> 03:21:52,309
Will that alert the horde? Oh, wait.

2385
03:21:52,309 --> 03:21:54,309
Right. They're just standing out there.

2386
03:21:54,309 --> 03:21:56,680
You can just hear me.

2387
03:21:56,680 --> 03:21:58,680
I think I heard something behind this door.

2388
03:21:58,680 --> 03:22:01,370
Maybe.

2389
03:22:01,370 --> 03:22:07,700
All right. Let's go for a drop-down kill.

2390
03:22:07,700 --> 03:22:10,969
Get the big guy

2391
03:22:10,969 --> 03:22:12,969
first, I'd say.

2392
03:22:12,969 --> 03:22:14,969
Yeah. Big guy first.

2393
03:22:14,969 --> 03:22:32,739
Hiya! Hiya!

2394
03:22:32,739 --> 03:22:34,739
I can't do that with the cold.

2395
03:22:34,739 --> 03:22:45,559
I was doing fucks.

2396
03:22:45,559 --> 03:22:47,930
I'm gonna say it this way.

2397
03:22:47,930 --> 03:22:49,930
No. You just gotta... No.

2398
03:22:49,930 --> 03:22:54,260
No. No. No.

2399
03:22:54,260 --> 03:22:58,100
Come on. Just one at a time.

2400
03:22:58,100 --> 03:23:02,459
Let me just throw... I'm gonna... Come here.

2401
03:23:02,459 --> 03:23:07,370
On the back. Bring it on.

2402
03:23:16,200 --> 03:23:18,200
Can you deflect that?

2403
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:21,270
I haven't even attempted to.

2404
03:23:21,270 --> 03:23:35,930
It does burn you though.

2405
03:23:35,930 --> 03:23:37,930
This dude's got a shield.

2406
03:23:37,930 --> 03:23:41,379
How do you break shields?

2407
03:23:41,379 --> 03:23:47,139
Come on down the stairs.

2408
03:23:47,139 --> 03:23:49,899
One shield at a time.

2409
03:23:49,899 --> 03:23:55,129
Please.

2410
03:23:55,129 --> 03:24:00,309
You're so slow.

2411
03:24:00,309 --> 03:24:02,309
You're so slow!

2412
03:24:02,309 --> 03:24:04,309
Get down here! What an idiot.

2413
03:24:04,309 --> 03:24:11,909
He's almost broken.

2414
03:24:11,909 --> 03:24:16,520
Just... Really?

2415
03:24:16,520 --> 03:24:22,790
Fine. Fuck it.

2416
03:24:22,790 --> 03:24:30,489
Oh my God!

2417
03:24:30,489 --> 03:24:57,239
Why do you have so much reach?

2418
03:24:57,239 --> 03:24:59,799
What am I supposed to do against this guy?

2419
03:24:59,799 --> 03:25:05,930
Um... Dodge around him?

2420
03:25:05,930 --> 03:25:07,930
And hit him in the back, probably?

2421
03:25:07,930 --> 03:25:10,549
Deflect and then break it eventually?

2422
03:25:10,549 --> 03:25:14,260
What is this idiot?

2423
03:25:14,260 --> 03:25:16,889
I think I just got hurt by stepping on a piece of metal.

2424
03:25:16,889 --> 03:25:18,889
It's a big thrust.

2425
03:25:18,889 --> 03:25:25,909
Push.

2426
03:25:25,909 --> 03:25:31,100
That hurts a lot.

2427
03:25:31,100 --> 03:25:33,100
I feel like there's a way easier way to do this.

2428
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:35,100
Yeah, I just gotta wait till they go...

2429
03:25:35,100 --> 03:25:40,979
Get out of the way.

2430
03:25:40,979 --> 03:25:43,479
Come on. Do something.

2431
03:25:43,479 --> 03:25:53,659
One of you do something.

2432
03:25:53,659 --> 03:26:00,500
Before I go mad.

2433
03:26:00,500 --> 03:26:16,889
Of course it does!

2434
03:26:16,889 --> 03:26:18,889
Hey, let's do a puppet show for him!

2435
03:26:18,889 --> 03:26:20,889
Fuck you!

2436
03:26:20,889 --> 03:26:27,799
He killed me again. I swear to fucking God.

2437
03:26:27,799 --> 03:26:40,090
Ugh!

2438
03:26:40,090 --> 03:26:42,090
Burn!

2439
03:26:42,090 --> 03:26:44,090
Use jump.

2440
03:26:44,090 --> 03:26:53,620
He blocks it.

2441
03:26:53,620 --> 03:26:59,129
Ow!

2442
03:26:59,129 --> 03:27:01,559
What the fuck?

2443
03:27:01,559 --> 03:27:04,440
What?

2444
03:27:04,440 --> 03:27:17,930
Unseen aid.

2445
03:27:17,930 --> 03:27:23,110
I have to use the axe that I just got.

2446
03:27:23,110 --> 03:27:25,110
I'm getting a break.

2447
03:27:25,110 --> 03:27:36,139
Half of skill, experience, and scent are lost upon death, but there is a way to avoid this on rare occasions.

2448
03:27:36,139 --> 03:27:41,659
Through the unseen aid of gods and Buddha, one may be spared this loss.

2449
03:27:41,659 --> 03:27:45,959
The chances of receiving unseen aid can be seen in the pause menu.

2450
03:27:45,959 --> 03:27:52,700
So I have to go get the dumb axe to break the shield.

2451
03:27:52,700 --> 03:27:54,700
Otherwise they just do a puppet show for five minutes.

2452
03:27:54,700 --> 03:27:57,190
So wait a minute.

2453
03:27:57,190 --> 03:28:03,020
Okay, acquired skills, right?

2454
03:28:03,020 --> 03:28:15,239
Unseen aid. So there's a 30% chance that when you die twice, you get to come back without losing anything.

2455
03:28:15,239 --> 03:28:17,239
So I didn't lose anything.

2456
03:28:17,239 --> 03:28:19,239
Alright.

2457
03:28:19,239 --> 03:28:24,229
Let me go put on the mandatory item.

2458
03:28:24,229 --> 03:28:26,229
He just lost a lot of respect.

2459
03:28:26,229 --> 03:28:36,860
Don't call him Pinshield.

2460
03:28:36,860 --> 03:28:38,860
Look, how was I supposed to...

2461
03:28:38,860 --> 03:28:40,860
I gotta like put this axe on.

2462
03:28:40,860 --> 03:28:44,620
One strike and easily turn a wooden shield into splinters.

2463
03:28:44,620 --> 03:28:46,620
Ugh.

2464
03:28:46,620 --> 03:28:48,620
That's such dog shit.

2465
03:28:48,620 --> 03:28:57,379
What?

2466
03:28:57,379 --> 03:29:02,139
A book of secrets that details a variety of techniques for use with Shinobi prosthetic.

2467
03:29:02,139 --> 03:29:05,139
Grants the ability to learn prosthetic skills.

2468
03:29:05,139 --> 03:29:07,139
You can also use it as a weapon.

2469
03:29:07,139 --> 03:29:10,200
You can also use it as a weapon.

2470
03:29:10,200 --> 03:29:14,420
You can also use it as a weapon.

2471
03:29:14,420 --> 03:29:16,420
A variety of techniques for use with Shinobi prosthetic.

2472
03:29:16,420 --> 03:29:24,870
Grants the ability to learn prosthetic style skills.

2473
03:29:49,399 --> 03:29:51,399
Okay.

2474
03:29:51,399 --> 03:30:03,579
um thanks for everything i mean wait wait don't just skip it so it's too emblem to do it big

2475
03:30:03,579 --> 03:30:16,870
strike breaks shields very cool let's get it on there i'm ready i'm ready to go and fight the enemy

2476
03:30:17,510 --> 03:30:32,629
but first let's see i have two points there's another skeletonry prosthetic arts

2477
03:30:33,510 --> 03:30:38,340
i should have a martial art that allows one to perform a forward dashing sword slice after

2478
03:30:38,340 --> 03:30:43,459
using a certain prosthetic tools allowing one to close distance on enemies instantly

2479
03:30:46,020 --> 03:30:58,540
oh so you can throw a shuriken and then dive in that sounds really great actually uses the grappling

2480
03:30:58,540 --> 03:31:03,100
hook to launch oneself add an enemy and use that momentum to perform a rolling sword attack

2481
03:31:05,129 --> 03:31:18,440
oh that sounds actually really fun i mean that's the ability to grapple into and do the spider-man

2482
03:31:18,440 --> 03:31:39,690
move to people i'm doing it what does that open up here nightjar slash

2483
03:31:42,020 --> 03:31:45,379
spinning leap attack that can quickly close or create distance from foes

2484
03:31:46,180 --> 03:31:54,680
use the weight of the massive shuriken to add force to the blow so you just leap forward what's

2485
03:31:54,680 --> 03:32:02,920
this one of course the healing effects of recovery items that's almost necessary in these games

2486
03:32:11,030 --> 03:32:45,739
oh okay i'm ready necessary yeah all right let's go skip this bullshit get to the shield guys

2487
03:32:48,280 --> 03:33:21,430
break their shields break their necks doesn't matter to me bring it on do something what okay

2488
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:40,280
good already done i was pressing the wrong button that's all right yay i'm very happy now very happy

2489
03:33:40,280 --> 03:34:06,840
happier than i've ever been i can go to that tree but for what this is kind of just here for no

2490
03:34:06,840 --> 03:34:35,780
reason i kind of you can swim yeah i know you can swim but let's just see i'm not i'm not rushing

2491
03:34:35,780 --> 03:34:47,719
through it you know let's just take a look i'm here the goal is not to get to the end as fast

2492
03:34:47,719 --> 03:34:52,600
as possible the goal is to enjoy the experience so let's just see if there's anything over here

2493
03:34:53,239 --> 03:35:16,819
there is what was that oh scale no that's just an angry fish no scale the mad fish

2494
03:35:18,979 --> 03:36:09,459
there's a tree here though what would this be here for um i there's somebody in here can i eavesdrop

2495
03:36:09,459 --> 03:36:21,799
on this person come on come on i'm right here really are you just weirdly pushed against the

2496
03:36:21,799 --> 03:36:31,670
wall where i can't do this if anyone's gonna get out they're only going to use this cave

2497
03:36:31,670 --> 03:36:50,979
don't let a single racket this cave this is the way to get out i don't love this guy brand

2498
03:36:56,549 --> 03:37:04,920
i didn't know there were this many people only two people were talking oh this is bad news now

2499
03:37:05,799 --> 03:37:21,510
oh it's so slow

2500
03:37:23,909 --> 03:37:33,379
guy with the bow gotta go now that's so important

2501
03:37:42,329 --> 03:37:47,290
it's so hard to time that in a game that's a thousand miles per hour in fighting

2502
03:37:48,250 --> 03:38:21,260
watching the guy slowly swing his fucking stick at you these two left

2503
03:38:21,260 --> 03:39:03,930
my god it's like he comes he's in slow motion where am i going all right there's like there's

2504
03:39:03,930 --> 03:39:12,520
a wizard down here why is there a wizard over here i don't know what to do about this should

2505
03:39:12,520 --> 03:39:40,090
i fight uh fight the wizard uh the thrust holy shit i'm gonna die wow

2506
03:39:40,090 --> 03:39:48,440
oh

2507
03:40:03,690 --> 03:40:22,170
holy shit this guy's insane did i just get a scripted wizard death

2508
03:40:25,049 --> 03:40:57,530
your death is not your fate just yet you died twice game over

2509
03:41:01,940 --> 03:41:08,680
wrought essence somewhere a pained cough rings out continuously the man who coughs

2510
03:41:08,680 --> 03:41:15,079
zealously sculpt statues of buddha to avoid being consumed by the building flames owning

2511
03:41:15,079 --> 03:41:25,989
this item reduces one's chance of receiving unseen aid wrought essence timid mane so wait they're

2512
03:41:25,989 --> 03:41:35,879
like dying or one with the power of the dragon's heritage dies the more a sickness known as dragon

2513
03:41:35,879 --> 03:41:42,040
rot spreads through the world if one known to the wolf is coughing and wheezing it's likely they are

2514
03:41:42,040 --> 03:41:47,719
afflicted with dragon rot the more wrought essence wolf has the lower the chance of receiving unseen

2515
03:41:47,719 --> 03:42:05,659
aid okay what's wrong dragon rot the stagnation overflows spreads the disease that leads eventually

2516
03:42:05,659 --> 03:42:16,459
death what you don't need to worry about me i'm not normal you see the more that i die the more

2517
03:42:17,420 --> 03:42:29,370
ask him about the rest i got so shit on by that guy he just attacked so many times in a row

2518
03:42:30,090 --> 03:42:41,670
have you seen the sculptor lately yes he's all i know is what dogan told me long ago

2519
03:42:41,670 --> 03:42:48,389
that the dragon's heritage can bestow the power of resurrection however it is not any ordinary

2520
03:42:48,389 --> 03:42:54,790
it kills everybody else needs to stagnation which will eventually reach a point where it

2521
03:42:54,790 --> 03:43:03,290
overflow this causes those who do not have the power to become sick a disease known as dragon

2522
03:43:03,290 --> 03:43:11,129
rot he knew much about it but even so he was so there is a penalty for using a cure forgive me

2523
03:43:11,129 --> 03:43:19,450
is there a way to treat this dragon rot i do not know it must be stopped i am unsure

2524
03:43:19,450 --> 03:43:25,690
for dying but the first step is to look through my mentor's research and see if i can discover

2525
03:43:25,690 --> 03:43:35,209
a way thank you just don't die easy i'm gonna lose i'm gonna have zero dollars by the end of

2526
03:43:35,209 --> 03:43:50,299
this playthrough i bet you anything i bet you i have five cents when this is all said and done

2527
03:43:50,299 --> 03:43:53,659
all right i feel like i probably shouldn't i need to go down and fight the wizard again

2528
03:43:53,659 --> 03:44:42,200
i mean how am i gonna just not have that happen uh shit try it again i have dragon rot let's keep

2536
03:46:37,430 --> 03:46:44,309

2540
03:47:39,829 --> 03:48:03,219
executive wall jump where why am i doing this hello um am i supposed to be here

2541
03:48:05,930 --> 03:48:39,350
okay i don't know where this is because i got another sculptor's idol uh any items that i can

2542
03:48:39,350 --> 03:48:55,909
get the fire looks beautiful that's too busy paying attention to how wonderful looking your game world

2543
03:48:55,909 --> 03:49:19,000
was from software and you put an archer right next to me that's a lot of people oh my nice eagle

2544
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:26,520
eye of course the guy with the fucking eagle eye really he has no line of sight on me he can't see

2545
03:49:26,520 --> 03:49:40,010
me and he's just shooting the wall that's unbelievable they shoot so much faster too

2546
03:49:41,290 --> 03:49:51,270
now i'm fucked oh i'm fucked here fighting more than one enemy in this game

2547
03:49:52,229 --> 03:50:03,159
there's like no way good luck what i got predicted i got predicted

2548
03:50:05,690 --> 03:50:11,299
holy shit oh my fucking god

2549
03:50:28,200 --> 03:50:34,920
come on why i i didn't know it was gonna happen you don't even have like one second of immunity

2550
03:50:35,879 --> 03:50:47,860
you don't have like a half second of immunity all right i can have a different approach to this

2551
03:50:47,860 --> 03:51:03,450
because this seems almost almost undoable you're gonna have to pick people up one by one you can't

2552
03:51:03,450 --> 03:51:11,500
you can't just walk up there no way give me my other tools i'm gonna have to do a pole here

2553
03:51:12,299 --> 03:51:37,750
i could do one or two at a time i need more than that that's an uh-uh let's go

2554
03:51:38,309 --> 03:51:55,989
if it didn't matter jesus i didn't see you

2555
03:52:01,350 --> 03:52:04,469
and i knew he's gonna shoot at me too

2556
03:52:22,360 --> 03:52:51,110
you fuck you all right so far so good watch out for hawkeye don't i have to grapple move to

2557
03:53:04,629 --> 03:53:32,420
music stop which means i'm safe almost not completely almost born that's burn powder

2558
03:53:32,420 --> 03:53:36,180
there's a lot of fire here something tells me i'm probably gonna need to use this

2559
03:53:36,979 --> 03:53:53,500
i gotta get my inventory ready is that maybe just go through the house almost incompatible

2560
03:53:54,139 --> 03:54:08,440
divine confetti made for driving away apparitions the paper is made ceremoniously

2561
03:54:08,440 --> 03:54:18,260
whereby pulp is spread thin using water from the exalted fountain head so this is to be able to hit

2562
03:54:18,260 --> 03:54:30,620
ghosts why is there you swing through this wall the whole the game's getting a full letter grade

2563
03:54:30,620 --> 03:55:08,780
downgrade anymore i see something oh that's just more of that okay no more enemies there's a bunch

2564
03:55:08,780 --> 03:55:19,450
of shit illusory wall i didn't clear everything over here though i'm gonna get spotted by something

2565
03:55:20,250 --> 03:55:49,750
maybe not it's down here nothing uh is there more i guess i can go this way

2566
03:55:50,549 --> 03:56:02,629
i don't know there's even more of these idiots over here well i'm gonna have to start pulling

2567
03:56:02,629 --> 03:56:26,520
people is sakiro the bad guy or the good guy he's an anti-hero he could be anything no no no calm

2568
03:56:26,520 --> 03:56:47,000
down i bumped into a fucking piece of plastic let's get a pirate here

2569
03:56:47,879 --> 03:57:04,840
i figured these guys out you just gotta get that lunge and insta-kill them i i'm not opening one of

2570
03:57:04,840 --> 03:57:38,299
those coin sacks try me until i'm gonna until i need them um who's drunk who's drunk joe's with

2571
03:57:38,299 --> 03:58:00,709
a drunkard i think i may have bumped out an economy um i well he certainly is drunk yeah

2572
03:58:01,829 --> 03:58:06,469
he certainly had a fuse to drink do i have to fight everybody in here

2573
03:58:08,010 --> 03:58:23,610
uh is he gonna do we all fight i'm confused right now it what is he doing is he stuck

2574
03:58:24,569 --> 03:58:34,219
so this is not a scenario where uh joe's who the drunkard comes out and kills everybody

2575
03:58:34,219 --> 03:58:51,530
and invites him that i miss that did i miss a cut scene i may have missed cuts i find him in the

2576
03:58:51,530 --> 03:59:03,239
hallway um this is bad this is very bad uh are you sure i don't get a like gun in this game

2577
03:59:04,040 --> 03:59:15,000
because that's how i would see completing this well got to deal with it right

2578
03:59:27,860 --> 04:00:04,409
as long as he stays stuck on stairs and shit i can care less who's next just me and you um all

2579
04:00:04,409 --> 04:00:13,610
right let's see what you got what moves do you got you got an acid spit he spits it two times

2580
04:00:14,569 --> 04:00:21,879
that lingers for a while too so this guy can be anti-poison that doesn't really hurt him

2581
04:00:22,120 --> 04:00:39,899
so wow that's a push okay he drinks i'm almost dead that was uh i could have gone a little better

2582
04:00:41,180 --> 04:01:06,569
shit i don't even know how i even happened i he like got stuck in the wall and then i had to

2583
04:01:06,569 --> 04:01:26,920
fight like six people i thought i was like if i ran into the middle it was gonna do like a

2584
04:01:27,559 --> 04:01:35,379
cut scene or something apparently not let me just see how that is supposed to work

2585
04:01:36,020 --> 04:02:02,629
yeah under a potential normal circumstance hold on so i'm realizing right now this whole this area

2586
04:02:02,629 --> 04:02:09,909
sucks can i just run by these guys or do i have to deal with this every time

2587
04:02:10,870 --> 04:02:19,879
like this gotta be a way i can jump over that again i can just run

2588
04:02:20,760 --> 04:02:26,569
how am i supposed to deal with this part and it's just kind of stealth to take out everybody

2589
04:02:35,129 --> 04:02:50,229
what oh hi hi there you want really come on i'm talking to an npc

2590

2591
04:03:19,129 --> 04:03:32,100

2593
04:03:37,620 --> 04:03:41,059

2594
04:03:41,620 --> 04:04:07,270
are you gonna fund it my controller has low battery my controller doesn't have low battery

2595

2596
04:04:15,670 --> 04:05:00,360

fucking slit this guy's throat when i'm like 15 levels higher no fuck this place

2598
04:05:05,000 --> 04:05:19,379
this place sucks there was another way i could go it's just they just just throw up like fucking

2599
04:05:19,379 --> 04:05:25,209
20 enemies in a fire zone and then a big fat guy comes out and drinks no i need i want to hear

2600

what that guy has to say i want to listen i want to hear the npc can i get over there through this

2601
04:05:45,559 --> 04:05:55,079
way i have to be able to right i swear to god if this is one of those scenarios where i have to go

2602
04:05:55,079 --> 04:06:01,100
get like another weapon art thing and i just fucking i throw like a grenade at him or something

2603

2606
04:06:34,200 --> 04:06:58,139
it's just one guy and he still has his sights on that's fine just talk to me so i can figure out

2607
04:06:59,180 --> 04:07:03,180
what i need to do here there's definitely something to do i have to like pull a lever

2608
04:07:03,739 --> 04:07:12,139
and a big log is gonna come crashing down from a tree that's right i can't move when you're in a

2609
04:07:12,139 --> 04:07:18,979
conversation with an npc they've made five of these games you can move when talking to people what

2610
04:07:49,940 --> 04:07:55,540
is to protect me yeah you can do something about it please never forgive me should i fail

2611
04:07:56,979 --> 04:08:05,180
i found the secret i found the way i found the way i found the way to do it all right we fight

2612
04:08:05,180 --> 04:08:09,899
together me and this guy i knew there was something weird going on but why didn't he uh

2613
04:08:10,459 --> 04:08:14,139
i hope he doesn't get his ass kicked wait wait wait wait wait can he just beat him for me

2614
04:08:15,579 --> 04:08:24,229
no no no no no he's gonna die i i wasn't prepared for this he's gonna get it like three

2615
04:08:24,229 --> 04:08:36,629
times and die what is the lock on doing why is the lock on this is i i don't like this lock on

2616
04:08:36,629 --> 04:08:47,219
very much i'm gonna be completely honest here it like keeps taking itself off of people he's dead

2617
04:08:50,549 --> 04:08:59,239
are you kidding me this is on by default no it's not oh fuck off game

2618
04:09:14,629 --> 04:09:17,590
kill all the minions then recruit the guy i didn't even know that's what it did

2619
04:09:17,590 --> 04:10:13,540
oh god that voice is gonna kill me he doesn't have fire i don't have any healing left or anything

2620
04:10:13,540 --> 04:10:19,049
either all right so i i know i have a basic understanding of how to fight

2621
04:10:22,579 --> 04:10:27,700
i'm gonna clear the people that are over here and then recruit them and then fight

2622
04:10:28,739 --> 04:10:39,219
be lucky that you can give one hit on see if i can

2623
04:10:41,639 --> 04:10:59,159
kill this dude i'm trying well that's a grab i somehow got

2624
04:11:01,239 --> 04:11:11,750
me poison spit i wonder if fire will work here even if i get a good dodge

2625
04:11:14,219 --> 04:11:44,680
do you want to grab oh you gotta just dodge those here we go i can pause the game all right let me see

2626
04:11:45,479 --> 04:11:52,870
get all this shit out of here i don't even i can't even yeah i have a healing pellet

2627
04:11:54,010 --> 04:12:08,389
um all right oil oil and then burn them maybe i wonder i'm gonna try covering with oil and burn

2628
04:12:08,389 --> 04:12:28,170

2629
04:12:33,500 --> 04:12:59,860
man this oh yeah i try to ignite his alcohol breath maybe um i have this like sinking feeling

2630
04:12:59,860 --> 04:13:07,399
that i'm not supposed to be in this area i don't know how true that is i have a feeling i skipped

2631
04:13:07,399 --> 04:13:11,879
too much and i'm way over my head pretty sure because there was like two areas that i

2632
04:13:12,600 --> 04:13:28,389
i feel like i shouldn't be here right now i'm gonna give this one last try before going back

2633
04:13:33,819 --> 04:13:40,579
something about this just feels harder than it should feel at least in regards to like how many

2634
04:13:40,579 --> 04:13:56,010
enemies are here how many healing gourds i have i don't like to heal this is so many people here

2635
04:13:56,010 --> 04:13:59,290
it almost i don't feel like these people should even be here this place is burning what are you

2636
04:13:59,290 --> 04:14:15,799
doing here this this like ramped up to a thousand let me see if i can just clear this

2637
04:14:32,280 --> 04:14:34,059
i forget it every time

2638
04:14:38,459 --> 04:14:50,700
let me burn ah fuck this area uh no no no i'm fighting five six people at the same time

2639
04:14:50,700 --> 04:15:01,620
not right now i'm going to be on fucking zone no thanks uh where was it over here right

2640
04:15:01,620 --> 04:15:18,260
i'm gonna come back when i have like another attack power i was gonna bang my head against

2641
04:15:18,260 --> 04:15:27,860
the ceiling because i'm so damn tall all right there was a couple of places that was over here

2642
04:15:27,860 --> 04:15:33,620
right because i remember being like oh i got this and i went back and i that whole area was me

2643
04:15:33,620 --> 04:15:42,040
dropping the bell so this is where i was going progressing kind of normally through the game

2644
04:16:04,969 --> 04:16:12,229
oh okay i'm all right

2645
04:16:16,540 --> 04:16:32,790
oh funny and money you see this you hear about that i got only one pellet though like i can just

2646
04:16:32,790 --> 04:17:19,770
see me hello not broken your guard yet how is that possible i hear the loud sound take his health

2647
04:17:20,409 --> 04:17:45,100
i hear who's making this noise uh it's a it's another boss really oh shit

2648
04:17:46,059 --> 04:17:56,700
chained ogre he's tied up to her grab attacks cannot be deflected there's no way to avoid

2649
04:17:56,700 --> 04:18:02,469
taking serious damage once grab enemy grab attacks can be evaded with a well-timed step

2650
04:18:02,469 --> 04:18:05,829
dodge even the strongest attacks are useless if they don't make contact

2651
04:18:06,629 --> 04:18:19,690
oh that was the exact same animation and energy as okay i'm gonna stop talking because i can't do

2652
04:18:19,690 --> 04:18:27,340
it and speak at the same time especially the blacksmith and dark souls one all right now i'll be

2653
04:18:27,340 --> 04:18:48,870
quiet i'm dead instantly this is insane insane what that's not a dodge that's not a time oh my you

2654
04:18:48,870 --> 04:19:07,290
got to be kidding me that's not dodge i don't think i even want to attempt to dodge that i'm

2655
04:19:07,290 --> 04:19:27,799
just gonna fucking i don't even know i don't even know still kill that guy let me try this again

2656
04:19:30,549 --> 04:19:46,229
she's not already up okay let's try this again i don't even honestly whoa i just saw an indicator

2657
04:19:46,229 --> 04:20:21,000
on his head there that was much faster you seriously have got to be kidding me what why

2658
04:20:21,000 --> 04:20:26,520

2659
04:20:26,520 --> 04:20:39,979

2660
04:20:39,979 --> 04:20:49,379
everybody should i just keep from i feel like i shouldn't be fucking resurrecting just to die again

2661
04:20:50,340 --> 04:21:15,690
wealth wrong button that's so quick i'm dead

2662
04:21:31,850 --> 04:21:38,889
he has like two different lunges he has a really like quick one that's the power bomb

2663
04:21:38,889 --> 04:21:51,239
and then he has a longer one which is the instant kill okay so let's try this again clear the trash

2664
04:21:51,559 --> 04:21:52,040
here

2665
04:21:54,440 --> 04:22:07,260
there's one more guy he's like up here can i get up there from over here

2666
04:22:12,870 --> 04:22:16,389
of course you can't fucking get it unless you start the encounter

2667
04:22:21,610 --> 04:22:30,709
don't get too overzealous here

2668
04:22:38,090 --> 04:23:31,750
grab again do it away don't believe me get this bolt motherfucker out of here no get greedy

2669
04:23:36,120 --> 04:24:01,909
for the burn again you gotta wait for the grab you gotta watch it elbow drop

2670
04:24:13,639 --> 04:24:31,909
i was just gonna drop it off the fucking ledge

2671
04:24:39,100 --> 04:24:46,700
why does he have elbow drops wwe ogre he's like the rock did they chain him up and like

2672
04:24:46,700 --> 04:24:52,780
fucking clockwork orange's eyes in front of like the attitude arrow all right got prayer beads a

2673
04:24:52,780 --> 04:25:12,340
loose prayer bead offering for them will increase okay two beads okay new medicine rank they wanted

2674
04:25:12,340 --> 04:25:19,530
to learn such techniques to be gravely injured time and time again by worthy opponents nice

2675
04:25:21,290 --> 04:25:27,959
i did it that was fun i didn't even have to complain that much about that fight

2676
04:25:28,520 --> 04:25:33,959
i did it was this guy up here that was the problem it was this guy the random guy standing up here

2677
04:25:41,450 --> 04:25:46,409
that was cool all right is that a boss or is it a how do i even know if it's a real boss

2678
04:25:47,129 --> 04:26:03,590
because we can go up there and nothing else right why does that just end up being a standard enemy

2679
04:26:04,229 --> 04:26:10,280
that would be so disheartening that's five community gifted subs from germa lied about

2680
04:26:10,280 --> 04:26:20,969
minecraft vr what a liar thank you uh nightjar monocular bamboo tube used to see distant objects

2681
04:26:21,690 --> 04:26:25,610
well shinobi already have good vision looking through this tube with one eye enables one to see

2682
04:26:25,610 --> 04:26:35,139
even further okay so this is the binoculars that no one ever uses i swear one day in one of these

2683
04:26:35,700 --> 04:26:41,930
from software games you know they oh wow i can't believe they're finding secrets in dark souls one

2684
04:26:42,729 --> 04:26:48,540
10 years later wow yeah that's interesting this is going to be something nobody puts the binoculars

2685
04:26:48,540 --> 04:26:53,899
on nobody uses them from software has probably something hidden in a skybox with the but you

2686
04:26:53,899 --> 04:27:01,909
can only see if you have the binoculars equipped the game like knows you have them on finally

2687
04:27:01,909 --> 04:27:06,149
another gourd seed i knew there was something going on in that last area like it was a secret

2688
04:27:06,149 --> 04:27:14,629
special little other area i had two flasks that place just felt way over my head and it was

2689
04:27:20,340 --> 04:27:41,290
anything else can't open that oh i see um uh this is like look uh i'm not doing this yet

2690
04:27:49,340 --> 04:28:02,899
i'm gonna like spend points and stuff hit 87 dollars i had like a thousand 20 minutes ago

2691
04:28:06,059 --> 04:28:18,299
uh do i have let me see three skill points maximum spirit emblems or three points i wonder if i

2692
04:28:18,299 --> 04:28:30,649
should hold off with this i wonder if i should wait one more point and get the better heal

2693
04:28:33,930 --> 04:28:36,420
or if i should do something else

2694
04:28:56,299 --> 04:29:02,680
i'm gonna have most of them eventually anyways but i think i'm gonna hold off for this one

2695
04:29:03,239 --> 04:29:46,520
i just don't know i just don't know maybe this uh uh this yeah i don't have any of these yet

2696
04:29:46,520 --> 04:30:02,899
counter thrust attacks by stomping down let me see do i need to put it on or is it just available now

2697
04:30:03,540 --> 04:30:18,459
i think it's just i just know it right passively right there's something about this game that makes

2698
04:30:18,459 --> 04:30:27,270
it distinctly more frustrating than other from soft games uh i think it's just not being used to

2699
04:30:28,149 --> 04:30:36,020
how the game is not supposed to play like dark souls it's the same engine it's the same inventory

2700
04:30:36,020 --> 04:30:42,870
slots the same ui technically right but you really are not supposed to play this like dark souls and

2701
04:30:42,870 --> 04:30:47,350
that is frustrating not because it's frustrating like oh i can't believe i want to play dark souls

2702
04:30:47,350 --> 04:30:52,739
4 but because you're just so used to playing all these games in such a fashion that

2703
04:30:53,700 --> 04:31:00,870
now you don't not anymore and your brain and your body kind of run into each other

2704
04:31:06,120 --> 04:31:15,719
but it's great i think it's great so far uh forget about these guys get me under

2705
04:31:20,149 --> 04:31:43,719
all right so oops that's the antagonist of the game uh cutscene no wait i'm not i have to fight

2706
04:31:43,719 --> 04:31:54,100
this guy this is the guy i fought in the first section is he just gonna all right um no it's

2707
04:31:54,100 --> 04:32:01,590
just it's just fight guy no this wait a minute people are shooting bows and arrows and shit

2708
04:32:02,309 --> 04:32:22,149
i'm not ready for this man he's got a lot of these things who's the other guy shooting

2709
04:32:22,149 --> 04:32:41,659
bow where is he where is he i didn't block that what how did you not block that

2710
04:32:59,209 --> 04:33:04,779
well now i know get everything i know there's no cutscenes that trigger why

2711
04:33:07,419 --> 04:33:11,020
all right you got a guy standing in a big open zone it's like okay like this is something's

2712
04:33:11,020 --> 04:33:22,259
gonna happen here nope aggro the whole time i gotta stop doing that because it's not a boss

2713
04:33:23,540 --> 04:33:25,860
i thought it was the guy from the beginning of the game

2714
04:33:32,700 --> 04:33:48,599
when you get in a situation like this you just die it's almost it's almost impossible to come

2715
04:33:48,599 --> 04:33:55,959
back from this with like five people chasing you might as well just die twice just do the title of

2716
04:33:55,959 --> 04:34:14,229
the game just bone out yeah like no reason especially considering that it's the game

2717
04:34:14,229 --> 04:34:27,959
pauses why wouldn't i just leave oh my god and we get to learn the hard way that

2718
04:34:28,919 --> 04:34:49,180
that takes almost twice as long as it does in dark souls okay good cool so we're gonna wrap around

2719
04:34:52,040 --> 04:35:08,360
wrap around and stealth kill a few people and then fight the guy in the middle just like this

2720
04:35:08,919 --> 04:35:51,380
where do they are what else do i got come here i just if you do that you're gonna

2721
04:35:51,380 --> 04:36:04,330
shatter every bone in your wrist you have to give me another arm um yeah can i

2722
04:36:05,450 --> 04:36:19,990
i just want to sneak around but that guy's is looking this uh nice stealth well this

2723
04:36:20,950 --> 04:36:27,560
and now here we go again hey play the fucking benny hill music here's 15

2724
04:36:27,560 --> 04:37:13,770
fucking people chasing you reset all right again so what's over here can i do something over this

2725
04:37:13,770 --> 04:37:21,139
way i feel like this guy's always taking a look to the left so i'm you just i can't even go that

2726
04:37:21,139 --> 04:38:06,549
way so let's try this way nope are they all connected to the same computer

2727
04:38:19,110 --> 04:38:26,580
yes they are actually yeah i mean i mean like but they communicate with this thing called son

2728
04:38:27,380 --> 04:38:43,240
well then you have to go to the left so the question is how do i get this guy to turn

2729
04:38:43,240 --> 04:38:49,979
fuck around because it's obvious it's obvious right that i have to go this way i can't go

2730
04:38:49,979 --> 04:38:54,299
over there everybody sees you and then the entire game aggro's to you so let's let's try this way

2731
04:38:56,650 --> 04:39:06,090
no guy walks guy walking this way right now he's ready to come over here um how do i pull this guy

2732
04:39:06,090 --> 04:39:26,380
without pulling the whole entire game it's got to be over here like this he doesn't walk all

2733
04:39:26,380 --> 04:39:32,979
the way up here does he what path is this he just comes to the very top of the stairs

2734
04:39:36,380 --> 04:39:39,099
don't tell me you just stand there you turn around eventually right thank you

2735
04:39:51,580 --> 04:40:00,069
that leaves this guy who i wonder okay let me just throw this out here does he not hear that

2736
04:40:01,029 --> 04:40:46,569
um i mean this i guess i just go get him everybody saw here we go but even the guy from down here

2737
04:40:51,610 --> 04:41:03,380
this guy with the frying pan maybe i should kill frying pan guy first

2738
04:41:04,919 --> 04:41:25,450
this is enough weeds to hide me probably not still get line of sight oh god what do i do

2739
04:41:27,369 --> 04:41:31,529
what um okay i'm gonna i'll take it i don't know where i am but i'll take it

2740
04:41:32,549 --> 04:41:42,459
that confetti again what was this turn back if you value your life you can't behead the headless

2741
04:41:42,459 --> 04:41:58,069
our swords and pikes did nothing so this is a new zone i'm not done with this one yet though

2742
04:41:58,069 --> 04:42:14,389
not yet as if i can go around there's an opportunity this is an opportunity to

2743
04:42:14,389 --> 04:42:27,349
catch this guy without anybody else maybe i think i can pull this guy and just be me and him i don't

2744
04:42:27,349 --> 04:42:48,470
see anybody else let's go here we go not far enough all right the question i had is

2745
04:42:49,430 --> 04:43:53,779
i got and he didn't see me first he's literally looking at me i don't oh my god oh that's a jump

2746
04:43:53,779 --> 04:44:52,020
that's a jump okay he does that slap he broke my guard easy no wow oh what oh why that was

2747
04:44:52,020 --> 04:45:35,139
like a quarter of a second move oh what was that oh i thought i was dead i just wow

2748
04:45:36,099 --> 04:45:58,950
oh holy shit now i gotta do all that dog shit again the whole courtyard with the guy the frying

2749
04:45:58,950 --> 04:46:19,049
pan i gotta kill that guy first he's frightening but he's gonna start playing the music the second

2750
04:46:19,049 --> 04:46:22,810
i step out here it's like gonna be like ready watch this i'm gonna stay i'm gonna go for frying

2751
04:46:22,810 --> 04:46:33,639
pan man first and then it's gonna go everyone's gonna be fighting me ready here we go it already

2752
04:46:33,639 --> 04:47:12,099
happened it's very much only go so far it only goes a short distance in front of you where is this

2753
04:47:16,119 --> 04:47:30,229
how did you even get there should i even ask

2754
04:47:31,959 --> 04:48:00,950
good game must be bullshit there he is let's go oh no no no no no no no no i want to fight

2755
04:48:00,950 --> 04:48:37,060
him alone not like with three people move and move is oh there's this like dickhead friend that

2756
04:48:37,060 --> 04:48:53,849
came running i have to get away from this it's not possible to fight two or three people at the same

2757
04:48:53,849 --> 04:49:16,180
time you gotta like a running hide or something i'm gonna go upgrade i have a seed no that's not

2758
04:49:16,180 --> 04:50:02,009
the right way it's this way let's create three heals undying samurai training oh uh i'm gonna

2759
04:50:02,009 --> 04:50:09,529
do that why are you guys talking shit about the vaude what's we why are you making fun of the vaude

2760
04:50:10,169 --> 04:50:21,799
you may use me to hone your staircase let's see how this works i should know we can perceive

2761
04:50:21,799 --> 04:50:24,520
incoming thrust attacks encounter them by stepping on the enemy blade

2762
04:50:25,159 --> 04:50:41,459
there's a powerful if risky move that deals more posture damage but how do you dodge in a direction

2763
04:50:42,419 --> 04:51:04,810
that's actually really good face me again it's a chat thing i wouldn't understand well that's good

2764
04:51:04,810 --> 04:51:11,139
to know so it's just a standard dog whatever you like if you have techniques thank you what about

2765
04:51:11,139 --> 04:51:30,389
in here anything unhip what do you mean unhip who's the lady oh no are they like dying here

2766
04:51:30,389 --> 04:51:37,340
together what are you doing hmm oh i didn't realize you were here the sculptor has been

2767
04:51:37,340 --> 04:51:44,549
coughing blood i took a sample of this blood for my dragon rod research a sample of his blood

2768
04:51:44,549 --> 04:51:50,470
yes blood that he's coughed up the color of the blood itself appears to be tainted

2769
04:51:51,110 --> 04:51:58,919
tainted blood but sculptor's blood alone isn't enough to reach any conclusion is there anything

2770
04:51:58,919 --> 04:52:06,119
i can do yes bring me samples of blood coughed up by others that suffer from the dragon rod

2771
04:52:06,119 --> 04:52:11,639
if i have more i'll be able to learn more about the disease if i come across anyone

2772
04:52:11,639 --> 04:52:28,200
afflicted by the dragon rod i'll ask them thank you three heels and i don't think i don't think

2773
04:52:28,200 --> 04:52:43,130
i have any more skills i can do right not at the moment no no well midair deflection or run and slide

2774
04:52:48,180 --> 04:53:25,380
i'll hold on to it quick give me some of your blood so i can use it so what about that door

2775
04:53:26,020 --> 04:53:51,180
can i just open the door hold on it's important uh where what was that where is that door i don't

2776
04:53:51,180 --> 04:54:04,200
even know what to do here i really don't it's gonna wait for this guy i want maybe i can stealth

2777
04:54:04,200 --> 04:54:37,220
kill that guy eventually i don't know i do appreciate the stealth kill but it i don't

2778
04:54:37,220 --> 04:55:02,659
like how loud it is if you i feel like everyone's hearing that the big like chime sound um okay those

2779
04:55:02,659 --> 04:55:10,970
two guys with shields or they just props i kind of i don't know what do you do when you have a

2780
04:55:10,970 --> 04:55:16,939
shield that big you just kind of sit on the ground and rest on it right well these guys be able to

2781
04:55:16,939 --> 04:55:42,040
see me this guy's freaking me out all right so there's that guy over there can i get on top

2782
04:55:42,040 --> 04:55:53,319
of the roof this is not that is a roof right there but what's the next step did everybody hear

2783
04:55:53,319 --> 04:56:09,930
that he's the guy with the pan he's gonna he's gonna start smacking the pan then everyone's

2784
04:56:09,930 --> 04:56:45,459
right here there's a big guy there he is he's a guy with a musket over here i had to let him do it

2785
04:56:45,459 --> 04:56:49,220
for a little while longer because that's the only thing he does he doesn't know how to do anything

2786
04:56:49,220 --> 04:56:54,970
else i mean i just wanted to make sure that he at least got some enjoyment of the last few seconds

2787
04:56:55,529 --> 04:57:13,139
okay i believe that's everybody where's big guy there he is now can i get the drop on him

2788
04:57:14,099 --> 04:57:23,619
with a stealth jump thing because he comes back to here right he's gonna come walk and he's gonna

2789
04:57:23,619 --> 04:57:36,549
turn around um i don't know if i can at least not from here i could try to just backstab him but

2790
04:57:37,270 --> 04:57:42,630
i feel like he's he'll probably hear me i'll try i'll give it a go i'll give it a go on this next

2791
04:57:42,630 --> 04:58:27,139
turn here just do that every time oh that sucked he's gonna get all of his posture back now

2792
04:58:43,700 --> 04:59:07,159
ah no don't do that shit oh my goodness gracious that's a new move i'm gonna die again

2793
04:59:07,159 --> 04:59:48,490
i had it going too i'm gonna kill him i think but it's gonna be real fucking messy well i have three

2794
04:59:49,290 --> 05:00:08,340
all it took was me uh making everybody sick again at least that guy's dead you know what this game

2795
05:00:08,340 --> 05:00:19,740
reminds me of metal gear rising it's like a more punishing version of metal gear rising in a way

2796
05:00:19,740 --> 05:00:28,310
that parry feels like metal gear rise it's like a slowed down version of trying to block with that

2797
05:00:28,310 --> 05:00:51,400
so all right so how do i cross this bridge doesn't look like i can grab it from here

2798
05:00:52,619 --> 05:01:03,080
uh well i think i found it what

2799
05:01:06,310 --> 05:01:33,779
no i'm gonna sneak attack you if i died by that lizard very embarrassing i need one more bead

2800
05:01:35,139 --> 05:01:50,040
i'm assuming memory is when you do those other areas oh that one hurt that one hurt okay

2801
05:01:53,909 --> 05:01:57,000
all right here you go you ready for the my impressions of the game first impressions

2802
05:01:57,880 --> 05:02:05,900
is hard as shit yeah i feel like the learning curve is way steeper than their previous games

2803
05:02:07,299 --> 05:02:17,819
but i feel like killing even basic enemies feels like you did something in the game i would say

2804
05:02:18,459 --> 05:02:33,240
it's definitely really really really good there is a sense of accomplishment for killing guy with

2805
05:02:33,240 --> 05:02:46,200
sword in his hand what is going on because yeah they can kill you just as easily what's that

2806
05:02:46,200 --> 05:03:14,310
earthquake is there gonna be an avalanche don't tell me there's an avalanche mid yeah i know how

2807
05:03:14,310 --> 05:03:24,150
to do that well not yet not yet wait wait wait wait wait wait there's probably something over here

2808
05:03:24,790 --> 05:03:50,459
there'll be something cool it just don't die don't die don't die don't die don't die good what it's

2809
05:03:50,459 --> 05:03:56,700
a turtle what is that it's a snake it's is it a turtle they's those turtles with the huge heads

2810
05:03:56,779 --> 05:04:15,349
remember those things oh god i know oh that's big that's a big snake do i have to fight this snake

2811
05:04:22,860 --> 05:04:30,459
uh okay it's like it's like mario no no no no no not like mario i i mean uh does the thing in

2812
05:04:30,459 --> 05:04:48,659
mario 64 we have to walk on it it's like it's a moving uh yes it's not gonna hurt me i have

2813
05:04:48,659 --> 05:05:04,970
to actually walk on this just like in mario here we go oh shit okay i'm alive did i miss something

2814
05:05:04,970 --> 05:05:20,299
i think i may have missed something maybe he's just here for fun i get to come back

2815
05:05:21,099 --> 05:05:37,380
his shadows died three times in my case uh but there's an item right there god damn it hold on

2816
05:05:37,939 --> 05:06:01,459
can i get back over here is he just in the cave i don't even know where i ended up where is he

2817
05:06:02,180 --> 05:06:20,759
oh i don't know where he is he's gonna make it down here i don't think he can this sucks

2818
05:06:20,759 --> 05:06:52,040
oh wait what okay so snake looks for you don't go near snake avoid snake died to pin snake

2819
05:06:54,139 --> 05:06:59,060
you guys are gonna be on that all night huh you guys gonna be on the pin snake thing

2820
05:06:59,779 --> 05:07:08,860
well now i can at least there's no items or anything so

2821
05:07:09,419 --> 05:07:18,180

2822
05:07:18,979 --> 05:07:33,049
all right that leaves this watch out snake just get across he can't go over that way

05:12:37,750 --> 05:12:50,419
when he turns to the left and then i'm gonna be hit by the icicles right i don't even know

2840
05:12:50,419 --> 05:12:57,110
what this is gonna look is it like mario rpg if i can i hide behind he's gonna see me he's gonna

at the softlock guys i can't even press start i can't press select i can't press y

2845
05:14:44,180 --> 05:15:09,500

2846
05:15:09,500 --> 05:15:17,849
all right i have to that was really loud um

2847
05:15:22,740 --> 05:15:30,169
maybe if i breathe wait hold on why can i do left and right but nothing else

2848
05:15:34,470 --> 05:16:09,380
where's this gonna put me i was under the impression that it was i was gonna hurt him

2849
05:16:09,380 --> 05:16:14,259
or something and then i would have to hide again i'm i'm i can't even how am i gonna justify

2850
05:16:14,259 --> 05:16:27,049
anything anymore let's see what happens i'm the only person that ever walked back in the dumpster

2851
05:16:27,689 --> 05:17:00,360
but i felt safe in there even the developers didn't go back in the dumpster please don't tell

2852
05:17:00,360 --> 05:17:26,860
me that that right that's not fair okay that's um we have a major problem here i couldn't just

2853
05:17:26,860 --> 05:17:49,299
resurrect r2 didn't work uh-huh r2 doesn't work anymore i and neither to start i can't pause the

2854
05:17:49,299 --> 05:18:13,029
game can i do it on keyboard no hold on all right that was weird why look at my i didn't i didn't

2855
05:18:16,020 --> 05:18:24,549
okay that let's go unplug the controller it seems like it's fixed now but just for the sake of doing

2856
05:18:24,549 --> 05:18:46,970
that i'm gonna do it just because you know okay i think everything is now fine let's go back and

2857
05:18:47,930 --> 05:18:59,930
this time only go in the bird house once i thought there was no fall damage in the game silly me

2858
05:19:00,490 --> 05:19:57,939
don't do anything silly okay then it's into the outhouse until he turns left and there we go into

2859
05:19:57,939 --> 05:20:22,220
the dumpster but the item i gotta okay i'm gonna stab him and then get the item i have like a couple

2905
05:40:27,500 --> 05:40:34,680
when to resurrect and when not to resurrect don't tell me i'm doing this very wrong

2906

2908
05:41:40,119 --> 05:42:22,259

2909
05:42:42,869 --> 05:43:00,979
oh wowie let's go all right i'm gonna take one of these right now phase two

2910
05:43:01,619 --> 05:43:27,060

2911
05:43:27,700 --> 05:43:45,779

2912
05:44:18,680 --> 05:44:49,319
no i don't think so goodbye fuck off yeah shinobi execution memory

2913
05:44:51,880 --> 05:44:55,639
the battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf

2914
05:44:57,720 --> 05:45:01,799
commune with the sculptor's idol and confront memories of battle to permanently increase

2915
05:45:01,799 --> 05:45:12,740
attack power keeper of ashina castle gate mechanical barrel a mechanical metal barrel

2916
05:45:12,740 --> 05:45:18,310
that can be given to the sculptor to enable prosthetic tool upgrades it's perfectly inside

2917
05:45:18,310 --> 05:45:39,580
the wrist okay so after almost six hours of playing i started to realize that you don't

2918
05:45:39,580 --> 05:45:55,509
have to just parry every attack that's why i beat him there not really it helped it does help but

2919
05:45:55,509 --> 05:46:07,990
you don't have to i was under the impression that that was you had to do that it makes you look cool

2920
05:46:07,990 --> 05:46:22,389
yeah it does you can just block and then parry parry block swing swing block and you can dodge

2921
05:46:22,389 --> 05:46:28,650
it i'm i was trying to go a little too fast with it in regards to perfect parry perfect

2922
05:46:28,650 --> 05:46:39,580
parry perfect parry swing swing swing swing you don't have to do that okay so i have

2923
05:46:40,220 --> 05:46:56,700
prosthetic tool upgrades yeah yeah yeah upgraded tools can be created now i should okay that's

2924
05:46:56,700 --> 05:47:22,069
another level up cool is there anything else here that i can do i think i'm good here unless

2925
05:47:22,069 --> 05:47:48,549
i can get up there which i don't think i can wait what's in there might as well the enhance

2926
05:47:48,549 --> 05:47:53,189
attack power option has been unlocked you can now consume battle memories to increase your attack

2927
05:47:53,189 --> 05:47:59,849
power causing you to deal more vitality and posture damage with your attacks but wait a minute

2928
05:48:01,770 --> 05:48:26,340
should can i put this in the buddha and should i not use this yet let me see what is it attack

2929
05:48:26,340 --> 05:48:36,840
power one let's just do it battle memory of an extraordinary foe although distant

2930
05:48:37,400 --> 05:48:43,779
recollection of such a memory provided sustenance for the wolf onewa once led a group of infamous

2931
05:48:43,779 --> 05:48:49,139
bandits but was defeated by ishin who was so captivated by his show of strength that he took

2932
05:48:49,139 --> 05:48:56,580
him in as an ashini warrior onewa would later go on to become gen nichi row ashina's most trusted

2933
05:48:56,580 --> 05:49:13,049
retainer attack power has been enhanced yeah why is that memory one out of one weirdly enough okay

2934
05:49:13,770 --> 05:49:33,369
let me go back to the temple give this upgraded thing so you can't hold on to more than one

2935
05:49:40,259 --> 05:49:47,930
it's a mechanism that can serve as the very core of the prosthetic

2936
05:49:48,009 --> 05:49:54,889
pendant here fit it to the arm what difference does the barrel make with a versatile base such

2937
05:49:54,889 --> 05:50:04,259
as this i can use various purifying agents to further all agents purifying agents of materials

2938
05:50:06,099 --> 05:50:20,700
gunpowder scrap metal things like gunpowder and scrap do have a lot of those things i don't have

2939
05:50:20,700 --> 05:50:34,020
any more tools do i no but i do have upgrade materials and sen can be spent to create upgraded

2940
05:50:34,020 --> 05:50:40,790
versions of tools you must own the base tool and also complete any prerequisite upgrades

2941
05:50:43,110 --> 05:51:00,020
okay so we've got unknown tool look at this spring loaded axe unknown shuriken it's like

2942
05:51:00,020 --> 05:51:22,740
monster hunter spring load flame vent i can't do any of these yet very cool okay that i already did

2943
05:51:30,540 --> 05:51:47,830
so now now i'm gonna try to go back and do fat guy i have no money unless there's some hold on

2944
05:51:47,830 --> 05:52:05,419
let me see the castle gate is there something else i missed here yeah it didn't open this door

2945
05:52:06,139 --> 05:52:18,180
why is sub only on uh people are kind of going crazy in the first like hour or two of the stream

2946
05:52:19,060 --> 05:52:25,049
so i figured maybe we should chill it out for a little while so we're just gonna keep going

2947
05:52:25,049 --> 05:52:58,069
progress oh right give me the days i wish sub only mode was on all the time things are

2948
05:52:58,069 --> 05:53:04,150
chilling i could read messages um i mean it has i think it has a time and like a place for it

2949
05:53:05,189 --> 05:53:22,599
something like this is not really uh brand new from software game i think you know warrants

2950
05:53:22,680 --> 05:53:26,619
maybe it being on for the sake of you know somebody's

2951
05:53:27,340 --> 05:53:35,099
vaccinating like crazy or saying spoilers or stuff like that you know it's kind of it's by

2952
05:53:35,099 --> 05:53:59,659
design right all right let's get let me see i guess we're gonna go this way spoilers anything

2953
05:53:59,659 --> 05:54:18,950
else up here i want to get over there uh can i nope that's just not gonna happen is it

2954
05:54:19,669 --> 05:54:41,180
i'm gonna have to go on the roof from here that's more like it more attack power candy can only hold

2955
05:54:41,180 --> 05:55:13,779
so much of it what really i mean i think i jumped into it i that's not fair i just got kaizo blocked

2956
05:55:13,779 --> 05:55:19,900
well i'm kind of being sloppy now yeah look at how look at how just sloppy i'm being i used

2957
05:55:20,939 --> 05:55:27,020
five thousand percent of my brain power on that last boss i'm dead i i'm just gonna die i don't

2958
05:55:27,020 --> 05:56:05,479
want to use the resurrect okay let's try this again so let's take a look at this before i just

2959
05:56:05,479 --> 05:56:16,360
sloppily just run out naked two guys down here something over here too uh let's go over this

2960
05:56:16,360 --> 05:56:54,459

05:57:15,959 --> 05:57:37,540
to actually take their boy oh boy oh boy i can't i gotta i gotta take the actual health down

2963
05:57:38,580 --> 05:58:02,009
i can't even tell when they're attacking really just die again uh it's possible we're getting

2964
05:58:02,009 --> 05:58:21,770
close to gamer fatigue it's very possible yeah when you make mistakes like that like literally i

2965
05:58:22,490 --> 05:58:29,220
it's like a cinder block in my brain right now let me go back here for a second

2966
05:58:29,779 --> 05:58:41,830
okay that was a car on top of another car there's no way that wasn't just a triple decker car and

2967
05:58:41,830 --> 05:58:49,540
the car on top even though isn't moving is in neutral was holding the gas down why

2973
06:00:44,040 --> 06:00:48,759
increase resurrected power restore the power of life to those who have been drained of it by

3004
06:10:31,479 --> 06:10:43,139
it just drains you of all ability take medicine i took day cool like five hours ago you only take

3005
06:10:43,139 --> 06:10:53,180
that shit like once every 10 to 12 hours all right let's see so enhance physical attributes

3006
06:10:53,340 --> 06:11:06,220
enhance physical attributes do it strung together an offering to a sculptor's idol

3007
06:11:07,020 --> 06:11:21,619
maximum vitality and posture nice max vitality and posture both increased good i'm very happy

3008
06:11:21,619 --> 06:11:34,069
about this let's go deal with the rats you take a shit every 10 to 12 hours sometimes

3009
06:11:35,029 --> 06:11:55,220
sometimes that happens all right where were those little guys like up this way right where

3010
06:12:00,709 --> 06:12:19,180
where were those little mushroom dudes little like little guys over here no other way

3011
06:12:25,270 --> 06:12:38,619
did i beat the horseman i did i did he was he's pretty cool well i'm gonna have this is it up here

3012
06:12:44,599 --> 06:12:50,279
need a vroom emote at this point yeah but a vroom emote

3013
06:12:54,459 --> 06:13:06,200
all the time they're over here there we go okay let's fight the where are they

3014
06:13:06,520 --> 06:13:22,389
there's one here he's facing this direction there's one that's the point of emote

3015
06:13:23,830 --> 06:13:39,349
yes i know black gunpowder good get off me get off me get off me

3016
06:13:43,290 --> 06:13:45,209
is it weird that i want somebody to do that to me

3017
06:13:47,130 --> 06:14:04,020
it's like looney tunes he broke every bone in my back all right how many more

3018
06:14:04,020 --> 06:14:19,779
is there another one did it say how many there were last seen around the castle gate

3019
06:14:23,189 --> 06:14:55,049
oops i think that's it unless it's somewhat here which i don't see there's only three i think

3020
06:14:55,049 --> 06:15:15,220
let's see what he says is this guy just gonna give me kill quests imagine finding out your

3021
06:15:15,220 --> 06:15:20,180
neighbor is not only a streamer but is obsessed with you and has an emote dedicated to you because

3022
06:15:20,180 --> 06:15:49,259
you drive loud apart from my arm machinist style skills it's a whole nother treat

3023
06:15:54,779 --> 06:16:03,509
it's our school of fighting no hard and fast movie just win your battles that alone is the

3024
06:16:03,509 --> 06:16:10,939
most important rule of the ashen style i hope it can be of assistance with your rat hunt and most

3025
06:16:10,939 --> 06:16:21,290
of all your own battles you get to fight about the ways of the ashina yeah it's our school of

3026
06:16:21,290 --> 06:16:27,540
fighting you just win your just win that alone somebody mentioned this was chat earlier

3027
06:16:29,130 --> 06:16:34,040
they're uh they were completely correct they were absolutely right okay here's uh

3028
06:16:36,650 --> 06:16:57,290
ashina i guess i have to be sitting down it's not a big deal you just win well okay

3029
06:16:59,060 --> 06:17:22,970
i wonder if i'm good enough to attempt fat guy again i'm gonna try ashina delivers a heavy one

3030
06:17:22,970 --> 06:17:29,770
hit overhead strike high posture damage and also recovers one's own posture with a strong forward

3031
06:17:29,770 --> 06:17:40,150
step single-minded mastery is the heart of the ashina style strength so just one big huge heavy

3032
06:17:40,150 --> 06:18:03,540
swing i gotta pick something and stick with it uh well here's your replayability that people

3033
06:18:03,540 --> 06:18:09,939
were concerned about i don't know if you can get all these maybe you can only do one of these trees

3034
06:18:09,939 --> 06:18:23,450
and maybe some of the other ones i don't know but this to me looks like replayability but

3035
06:18:24,009 --> 06:18:44,619
i'm going to end of the stream no no i'm trying to decide on what i want to do with my points

3036
06:18:45,419 --> 06:18:53,240
should i try this should i just do this all the way okay there's a slash and then there's a power

3037
06:18:53,240 --> 06:19:16,259
up power up there's all power ups this is the parry do something and but i got i'm gonna take

3038
06:19:16,259 --> 06:19:20,979
my time i want to make sure it's what i want to do i'm not just gonna go as fast as i can or hurry

3039
06:19:20,979 --> 06:19:32,500
up so when you just deflect it increases damage done to their posture from all sources that's

3040
06:19:32,500 --> 06:19:45,209
great so this is this is deflect every move let's put this up and see what it looks like

3041
06:19:45,930 --> 06:20:10,569
that takes a while ha ha wow that's it's gonna be hard to do it's worth a shot let's go try to

3042
06:20:10,569 --> 06:20:22,419
fight the the drunk guy i'm gonna be slow i'm gonna clear it out this is where we want to be

3043
06:20:28,709 --> 06:20:37,939
after this i'm probably gonna take a break and we're gonna start tomorrow probably early again

3044
06:20:37,939 --> 06:20:49,819
tomorrow i've leveled up twice well at once technically right let's just see if i can do

3045
06:20:49,819 --> 06:21:05,720
this shit does this go oh right okay and then i'm not going let me let me let me uh work backwards

3046
06:21:20,759 --> 06:21:24,279
and i say that because i want to fight the wizard he's the real boss of the night for me

3047
06:21:24,840 --> 06:22:10,490
i can't really tell what that was but no matter the boss was the friends we made along the way

3048
06:22:11,049 --> 06:22:43,560
i mean yeah okay clear now where was the wizard asshole so there was a way to go down

3049
06:22:44,200 --> 06:22:53,419
i panicked around here and i just started sprinting in random directions there's a

3050
06:22:53,419 --> 06:23:11,029
cave that was the cave i just came down though where is that guy here okay it was down here

3051
06:23:12,259 --> 06:23:39,540
all right let's go me versus the wizard i'm ready fuck i was waiting okay so that was a sweep

3052
06:24:00,040 --> 06:24:19,959
is there more than one wizard yeah there is it's a bunch of them they're just a regular enemy what

3053
06:24:19,959 --> 06:24:27,930
didn't block it no i blocked it fuck you what you got you can't block thrusts

3054
06:24:40,819 --> 06:24:53,000
no so many mechanics that need to memorize fuck dodge parry jump rock paper scissor

3055
06:24:54,169 --> 06:25:18,869
i have to go down there i don't know where the fuck i am right now i killed the first spear guy

3056
06:25:26,150 --> 06:25:30,389
now i have to do all this shit you know what i don't care i'm just gonna run by these fucking

3057
06:25:30,389 --> 06:25:36,569
people i'm just gonna run by the first wizard i want i'm supposed to see what's down here

3058
06:25:37,130 --> 06:25:57,500
i don't want to fight 10 15 people what's even down here that really just happened get it get it

3059
06:25:57,500 --> 06:26:43,029
get it get it okay that's it i got it i did it no oh my god just the the back and forth with the

3060
06:26:43,029 --> 06:26:49,189
fucking the dash the fucking it's just you have to just fucking muscle memory memorize it and it

3061
06:26:49,189 --> 06:27:11,419
takes a long time no that's wrong but i'm still gonna kill him like i had a ton of money on him

3062
06:27:11,979 --> 06:27:23,959
thank god i did this just my brain has trouble when that little indicator pops up it's almost

3063
06:27:23,959 --> 06:27:27,080
like i meant it's it's like playing batman right you're waiting for that to happen

3064
06:27:27,639 --> 06:27:32,599
but also on top of waiting for that to happen you need to like play the game too because think

3065
06:27:32,599 --> 06:27:39,819
about when batman you can just wait for that to pop up and just press y and be fine and be done

3066
06:27:39,819 --> 06:27:45,259
you gotta like be aware of everything going on and wait for the batman signal and it's one of three

3067
06:27:45,259 --> 06:27:55,220
different batman potential counters this game really makes you feel like batman i'm dead here

3068
06:27:55,220 --> 06:28:27,159
i got a bone out of here just don't let this guy kill me in the bone up it's a slow guy he's gonna

3069
06:28:27,159 --> 06:28:35,619
end it he's gonna end it isn't he isn't he no he's not don't do i don't have any pellets

3070
06:28:37,689 --> 06:28:52,900
no we don't throw that just distracted him all right bone out oh shit he's gonna end the stream

3071
06:28:59,509 --> 06:29:27,659
okay i'm not done yet all the way to the bottom okay okay

3072
06:29:35,610 --> 06:29:48,150
that leaves me with there's two ways for me to go right now i want to try i want to try to do

3073
06:29:48,150 --> 06:29:59,849
the drunk guy just once and then i'm going to rage turn off the stream don't ask me why i

3074
06:29:59,849 --> 06:30:20,069
boned all the way out here i'm dying of dragon rod yeah i know very very appropriate thing to

3075
06:30:20,069 --> 06:30:29,060
be suffering from right now right all right let's do this let's just go through wait a minute wait

3076
06:30:29,060 --> 06:30:38,819
wait wait wait don't i have a seed didn't i buy a seed did i already use it i did i use that seed

3077
06:30:38,819 --> 06:31:01,610
that i bought i don't remember using it maybe i did you piece of crap you piece of crap seriously

3078
06:31:01,610 --> 06:31:32,759
i didn't use it did i wouldn't it be in my inventory no i gotta go use this and should i

3079
06:31:32,759 --> 06:31:50,900
heal everybody's rod or should i wait till they're just barely dead and then resurrect the houses on

3080
06:31:50,900 --> 06:32:13,270
fire well let's heal is this healing them no that's the wrong thing what do i i gotta give to the

3081
06:32:13,270 --> 06:32:25,830

3082
06:32:25,909 --> 06:32:54,709
used it at his like buddha thing did he just he just didn't use it hopefully this is not a mistake

3083
06:33:04,220 --> 06:33:09,099
offer okay restore the power of light to those who have been drained of it by offering this drop to

3084
06:33:09,099 --> 06:33:21,930
the sculptor's idol with the recovery charm in hand still don't understand it appears as though

3086
06:33:31,740 --> 06:33:50,020
to consider for tomorrow but i want to just try to fight this guy and give one solid attempt

3087
06:33:58,709 --> 06:34:04,060
then i've got to go i'm gonna cry i'm gonna get some food i wanted to go a little bit longer

3088
06:34:04,060 --> 06:34:15,639
because i still want to play but of course of course i get cursed with getting sick the day

3089
06:34:16,360 --> 06:34:21,000
before one of the biggest releases of the year and not only that one of the most anticipated

3090

3091
06:34:28,250 --> 06:34:45,479

just keep coming come behind the wall here it's people shooting the arrows does these guys run

3093
06:34:59,819 --> 06:35:09,799
across the whole lake we've done it like three times it happens every time can you stealth not

3094
06:35:09,799 --> 06:35:25,930
here it's a big open field you can run past them well every time i run past them they just run

3095
06:35:25,930 --> 06:35:34,520
across the lake and i get hit by they like four or five people come from behind it's happened the

3096
06:35:34,520 --> 06:35:53,619
last three times we tried it yeah i on the roof you can run by them on the roof but there's always

3108
06:41:19,619 --> 06:41:26,790
slapping ass cheeks and anger god i've never concentrated more in a game than like that

3109
06:41:29,500 --> 06:41:41,189
i had it too so close it's definitely doable but fuck man that was i was like two hits away

3110
06:41:42,389 --> 06:41:48,330
just that string is so strange it's like champion gundyr that's what it reminds me of

3111
06:41:49,130 --> 06:42:13,779
when champion gundyr does that little like pain in the ass all right come on and see what i mean

3112

3120
06:45:36,790 --> 06:45:54,790
gonna happen eventually i know it okay if i go up there without him then i aggro everybody

06:45:54,790 --> 06:46:10,259
especially even the drunk guy so i have to take him with me you got to this part in two hours

3122
06:46:10,979 --> 06:46:31,080
well so did i but i went and did two other bosses and came back here i think it's time i don't even

3123
06:46:31,080 --> 06:46:50,229

3124
06:46:50,229 --> 06:47:21,349
use this like right now go hey you really i got this dumb aggro right now actually probably for

3125
06:47:21,349 --> 06:47:49,659
the best is he should i don't think he'll die to these guys really he might all right easy i don't

3126
06:47:49,659 --> 06:48:11,459
know why i did that but i decided to do it for some reason he's gonna die here i don't know

3127
06:48:11,459 --> 06:48:54,819
anymore even killed him thought he was done not enough go drink get it get it oh my god there's

3128
06:48:54,819 --> 06:49:31,979

06:50:33,580 --> 06:50:41,540
meant for sharing this cloudy sake is one of ishan ashina's favorites and his reputation

3133
06:50:41,540 --> 06:51:01,080
for getting one too drunk too quick okay yes oh that was rough and that's just like the third

3134
06:51:01,080 --> 06:51:09,819
mini boss there's been one real boss and then two or three mini bosses and man they're pretty rough

3135
06:51:10,380 --> 06:51:26,970
so let me see can i i can go this this is like the first act i told you i was gonna do it i

3172
07:06:21,669 --> 07:06:49,610
out of his stomach okay this is a fight you came up a little short maybe you should try that again

3173
07:06:49,610 --> 07:07:08,099
it's a sweep that's a sweep he's a sweeper i think a side dodge is better than uh he baseball swung

3174
07:07:08,099 --> 07:07:24,439
up my lord that's heavy he caught me in the air i was actually pretty good on his part

3175
07:07:25,159 --> 07:07:56,709
yeah i don't think i should try to parry that just dodge forehead guys with the bows are really

3176
07:07:56,709 --> 07:08:02,310
really really bad in this game they okay here's what they did from software took the dog and

3177
07:08:02,310 --> 07:08:06,709
yeah the dog sucks in every from software game let's make the dogs not a big deal but bow and

3178
07:08:06,709 --> 07:08:14,380
arrow guys used to be a joke the the arrow used to shoot like slower than it does in minecraft

3179
07:08:15,909 --> 07:08:27,139
now these guys are not a joke to replace these this is the new dog they get these guys have

3180
07:08:27,139 --> 07:08:47,779
guns sometimes now like seriously it was a big deal if somebody shot you in any of the other

3181
07:08:47,779 --> 07:08:56,009
from software games of the bow because they may as well have blue plates specials you from tribes

3182
07:08:56,009 --> 07:09:17,959
it was an embarrassment if you got hit by a bow and arrow in those games um some i'm gonna

3183
07:09:17,959 --> 07:09:28,810
somebody gonna all right wait a minute no that's i'm not there's no dad fight that's just dead

3184
07:09:30,330 --> 07:09:48,310
that's huge wonder i turned on the gas in the kitchen i was gonna make a fucking

3185
07:09:49,029 --> 07:10:06,919
tuna melt i fell asleep on the couch was a long day of killing all right here's the key key to

3186
07:10:06,919 --> 07:10:16,819
the hidden temple in the errata estate given by the owl you inconsiderate fuck

3187
07:10:18,439 --> 07:10:37,700
uh hold on this one's been building for a while the very back of the estate i know where it is

3188
07:10:37,700 --> 07:10:41,540
too the lord is absolute defended with your life if he is taken bring him back at any cost

3189
07:10:48,409 --> 07:10:56,869
no one ever told me to not put utensils in the microwave i was trying to heat him up to make it

3190
07:10:56,869 --> 07:11:40,409
so when i ate my soup it was nice and warm i'm not laughing at that wait why did the fire get worse

3191
07:11:41,590 --> 07:11:57,209
uh somebody talked about do how they do that without the ice cream you use you put you warm

3192
07:11:57,209 --> 07:12:03,049
up your utensils so you can eat ice cream easier it's like that's genius but what the fuck

3193
07:12:04,330 --> 07:12:11,500
so you what you put warm water like under the sink i've never even thought about that sometimes

3194
07:12:11,500 --> 07:12:16,860
i let the ice cream just sit on the counter for like three hours because it's too cold to eat

3195
07:12:17,659 --> 07:12:25,799
and i never thought for a second just to take a spoon and like put hot water on it well you

3196
07:12:25,799 --> 07:12:32,040
just chisel out and eat little ice cream chips and then you get sick of it you throw it that hurts

3197
07:12:34,279 --> 07:12:49,259
where do i need to go sneak i'm just boning out of here get to my left and follow the cliff

3198
07:12:49,900 --> 07:13:09,540
who's left my left or your left there might be an item or two that i missed

3199
07:13:09,540 --> 07:13:21,479
from here might as well just do it yeah it's possible jump down there because we're gonna

3200
07:13:21,479 --> 07:13:30,439
miss like the weird jumping from like monopoly house to monopoly house right that's cool that's

3201
07:13:30,439 --> 07:13:52,740
cool yeah ah that's cool all right here we are uh i can bone out of here just want to see if there's

3202
07:13:52,740 --> 07:14:06,229
anything that i missed on the left when did i stop taking the stream seriously i'm i'm still taking

3203
07:14:06,229 --> 07:14:24,419
it seriously all right here we go it's gonna is there anything i can i have nine hundred and

3204
07:14:24,419 --> 07:14:32,220
sixty four dollars i think i'm gonna where's the guy that i can buy stuff from somewhere in here

3205
07:14:32,220 --> 07:14:42,419
right no where are they you're like up here i got money and if this is a major boss that i'm going

3206
07:14:42,419 --> 07:14:58,840
to lose to over and over again i might as well use this money okay so is it up this way i know

3207
07:14:58,919 --> 07:15:22,360
there was a couple of npcs if here no this is progressing further what about this way maybe

3208
07:15:25,450 --> 07:15:46,680
possibly because this goes up into the rat guy and then over here yeah hi i do want to purchase

3209
07:15:46,680 --> 07:15:58,650
something yes i do i'm gonna get the firecrackers it's just another thing to try uh maybe i should

3210
07:15:58,650 --> 07:16:06,500
just buy a bunch of this stuff why would you purchase a coin i guess maybe just um yeah you

3211
07:16:06,500 --> 07:16:17,659
know what let's do it let's do it because i understand why you do that it's to store the

3212
07:16:17,659 --> 07:16:27,720
money so you don't lose it that makes sense what else would you use a coin pouch for in case you

3213
07:16:27,720 --> 07:17:19,000
die yeah that's cool interesting way to do it okay i'm ready god i just love video games okay take

3214
07:17:19,000 --> 07:17:48,869
those seeds use the key what's behind door number one oh boy that's a cutscene

3215
07:18:21,939 --> 07:18:58,840
is the real magician yes it looks like an actual wizard battle yeah good luck good luck you look

3216
07:18:58,840 --> 07:19:09,639
like a shoe i was gonna untie you and you'll be done uh vitality and posture yeah the lower

3217
07:19:09,639 --> 07:19:14,439
one's vitality the slower their posture recovers that's right posture gauges color gets redder as

3218
07:19:14,439 --> 07:19:22,459
recovery rate slows fast posture recovery ideally you gotta bring i gotta bring your health down

3219
07:19:26,220 --> 07:19:56,360
okay why lady butterfly why ah i don't know what that move does i'm assuming it's when she does

3220
07:19:56,360 --> 07:20:16,020
that like big dun dun like that well was that a grab i can't even tell i'm dead game over uh i

3221
07:20:17,509 --> 07:20:35,540
i'm not gonna resurrect until i have a better idea what the hell's going on no reason not to

3222
07:20:35,540 --> 07:20:54,840
well it's on a timer right it's not i thought when you what what about the pie she's just waiting

3223
07:20:54,840 --> 07:21:01,299
for me listen so that once she goes in the air it's a grab so you just have to dodge it

3224
07:21:02,419 --> 07:21:33,479
what is that is that does that count as a thrust dear god i have no idea damn it's hard to really

3225
07:21:33,479 --> 07:22:49,880
get around okay not bad back it up yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah die get out of my way

3226
07:22:49,880 --> 07:22:57,720
wait a minute the snap peas snap see snap peas should i even do this should i another attempt

3227
07:22:57,720 --> 07:23:11,290
so wait ah she's oh no but i don't have i need more healing i don't want to use one of these

3228
07:23:11,290 --> 07:23:20,970
items i know snap peas now but where i only have six of them where am i what do i get more of them

3229
07:23:21,529 --> 07:23:34,340
you know i'm saying i'm not gonna use them until i have a good attempt

3230
07:23:53,180 --> 07:24:02,659
why i have no reason not to respond i feel like this ain't gonna help me here

3231
07:24:06,419 --> 07:24:20,939
you can revive once the second one is on the timer okay i see start again i'm not gonna use the

3232
07:24:20,939 --> 07:24:56,680
those pellets either let's try let's go i'm hold on i'm all tangled up here really that sucks

3233
07:24:56,680 --> 07:25:35,700
that's a waste of an attempt right here get out of the way i'm out of posture eat this

3234
07:25:35,700 --> 07:25:46,150
that's actually not a bad move to do that it's so hard to avoid that fucking move you gotta wait

3235
07:25:46,150 --> 07:26:07,900
till the last possible millisecond kind of like spend some money to make that guy never come back

3236
07:26:08,619 --> 07:26:20,569
thankfully this is right here all right let's see you think i'm gonna die 200 times

3237
07:26:21,290 --> 07:26:45,500
no i think that's the first time i've seen that move what the fuck man oh my god give me even like

3238
07:26:46,299 --> 07:27:24,549
a second oh even one second one fucking second i didn't even get a chance i'll give you point

3239
07:27:24,549 --> 07:27:29,270
five seconds i'm gonna get i i'm gonna give us a few attempts somebody else is like dying from

3240
07:27:29,270 --> 07:28:00,650
fucking cough rot speak of which there it is this boss is really easy just make sure you don't get

3241
07:28:00,650 --> 07:28:33,689
hit and hit her if i can jump down all right easy ease it ease that's a that's a sweep

3242
07:28:34,330 --> 07:29:07,080
it was a sweep it's hell it goes on my healing she's already like backed up started out all

3243
07:29:07,080 --> 07:29:27,779
right and then uh you know what i think i'm gonna do i think i'm just gonna instead of healing just

3244
07:29:27,779 --> 07:29:52,740
die and then use all the heels she just blocked it really well i mean not heal at all go as long

3245
07:29:52,740 --> 07:30:43,380
as i can and die and then use my heels she's just very unpredictable that didn't come on now don't

3246
07:30:43,380 --> 07:31:33,110
do this to me breaking my rule it's a sweep on the ground pretty much every time gotcha don't let you

3247
07:31:33,110 --> 07:32:19,020
recover okay phase two let's just use them i'm gonna see what it does oh just eliminates them

3248
07:32:19,500 --> 07:32:38,790
okay i know it doesn't i what does that do that's kind of okay is that a sweep i can't tell

3249
07:32:40,180 --> 07:33:06,919
of course this asshole it's always a sweep on the ground it seems dude these little magical

3250
07:33:06,919 --> 07:34:11,819
fucking orbs watch out for those magics no god damn it that move oh fuck that move

3251
07:34:15,319 --> 07:34:37,509
that move sucks such ass oh fuck off what a load of dog shit perfect fucking dodges with like

3252
07:34:37,509 --> 07:35:24,630
no iframes oh fuck off each shit that's bullshit okay what the fuck give me a fucking break

3253
07:35:24,630 --> 07:35:49,270
no i didn't throw my controller i put it on the table slightly angrily i'm stuck on the

3254
07:35:49,270 --> 07:36:10,299
all right bites controller in half that was definitely the attempt to probably do it and

3255
07:36:10,939 --> 07:36:20,229
is it three phases i wouldn't be surprised you know it's like funny about these games especially

3256
07:36:20,229 --> 07:36:26,310
this game especially about squirrel i you know i probably could it's probably easier to win the

3257
07:36:26,310 --> 07:36:39,659
lottery than it is to beat these bosses you know what i mean i bet you okay in the time it takes

3258
07:36:39,659 --> 07:36:44,139
for me to beat this boss i could probably buy like a scratch ticket every like 20 minutes

3259
07:36:45,700 --> 07:37:05,529
and like win 50 bucks all right this is a dead run let me start over

3260
07:37:23,639 --> 07:37:29,299
every death is an hour of minecraft no i really i you know what i really need to do i really do

3261
07:37:29,299 --> 07:37:35,509
need to get out of here because if anybody knows anything about muscle memory and playing games

3262
07:37:35,509 --> 07:37:42,419
like this you gotta have like 24 hours for your brain to even know what it's doing see i haven't

3263
07:37:42,419 --> 07:37:48,180
like saved my game in my brain yet everything i've learned so far is not here until i do until i go

3264
07:37:48,180 --> 07:38:46,840
to sleep in skyrim no it's a sweep you have to get more uh no i wasn't close enough

3265
07:38:48,729 --> 07:39:00,490
are you almost at the health pool or i can actually hurt you i thought it was another dash

3266
07:39:01,689 --> 07:39:24,500
i thought it was gonna be a spin oh i can't get out i'm stuck oh my fucking god guys i can't move

3267
07:39:24,500 --> 07:39:31,590
like if i fell in my well it's in my house i don't know i don't know somebody is a rope

3268
07:39:31,590 --> 07:39:37,189

3293
07:49:39,020 --> 07:49:49,849
oh this game is so hard it's like next level now i see what people are talking about

3294

3301
07:53:44,790 --> 07:53:51,750
oath fails to step okay i'm gonna talk about this for a second those you've that you guys

3302
07:53:51,750 --> 07:53:57,669
that have seen the cinematic masterpiece and written down book masterpiece that is

3303
07:53:58,310 --> 07:54:05,819
the harry potter universe okay you know that scene when dumbledore the most the strongest

3304
07:54:05,819 --> 07:54:11,340
character in the entire universe right he drinks that he tells harry to do it he's gonna drink

3305
07:54:11,340 --> 07:54:18,759
that potion and he's like i can't i can't do it please no please i know no the strongest guy in

3306
07:54:18,759 --> 07:54:29,049
the whole world and he says let make sure that i do the whole thing right it's really hard and

3307
07:54:29,049 --> 07:54:33,290
he tells her like throughout the course and he's like i'm not doing it i'm not doing it i'm getting

3308
07:54:33,290 --> 07:54:45,099
it away from me but they do it and then spoiler alert i was gonna say that something else but

3309
07:54:52,020 --> 07:54:56,900
point is i was saying those things i was going no i can't do it i'm not gonna do it i'm done

3310
07:54:56,900 --> 07:55:02,919
i'm going home but all i just had to drink the rest of the potion and i'm now i'm fine

3311
07:55:10,580 --> 07:55:17,220
it's too much for me no it's too hard i gotta go i'm leaving how is that a bad analogy

3312
07:55:17,220 --> 07:55:35,590
dumbledore drinks the potion and he says he can and you took your hands off the

3313
07:55:35,590 --> 07:55:53,779
controller and this is what happens died to cutscene wheel okay

3314
07:56:24,490 --> 07:56:30,090
the potion actually like was the potion was killing dumbledore

3315
07:56:31,340 --> 07:56:48,779
no he was fine look i just missed him i just missed a major major storyline cutscene because

3316
07:56:48,779 --> 07:56:56,180
somebody questioned my dumbledore analogy i'm furious right now i am fucking furious what

3317
07:56:56,180 --> 07:57:27,110
just happened nothing here put this in firecracker blinds foes and inflicts posture damage on beast

3318
07:57:27,110 --> 07:57:34,009
type 70s i can't even it's time to go that is such a perfect opportunity for me to tell you that's

3319
07:57:34,009 --> 07:57:46,599
i'll see you tomorrow that wouldn't even words that was just phonetically pronouncing sounds

3320
07:57:46,599 --> 07:57:59,099
where i thought the spaces needed to be for the text that was on the screen all right so what do

3321
07:57:59,099 --> 07:58:04,009
you think about sakiro where would you put it in the oh we're gonna call it something different

3322
07:58:04,009 --> 07:58:22,919
now the the sakiro is born the the the the the the souls the souls kiro born games i don't know

3323
07:58:22,919 --> 07:58:32,169
it's really hard to say i i do think it is probably so first time playthrough i think is

3324
07:58:32,169 --> 07:58:41,139
the hardest i'm trying to remember dark souls 3 dark souls 1 bloodborne try remember the first

3325
07:58:41,139 --> 07:58:45,750
10 hours or so in the game i think it's the hardest first 10 hours of any of the games

3326
07:58:47,860 --> 07:58:51,779
now that who knows if that's going to keep being the case whether or not you know when i have my

3327
07:58:51,779 --> 07:58:58,299
save point when i wake up tomorrow my muscle memory and all that it it's fantastic though

3328
07:58:58,540 --> 07:59:12,599
it's everything and more that snake was just 10 out of 10 it's great to get your ass kicked by

3329
07:59:12,599 --> 07:59:21,419
a game that's really really hard but i'm gonna that's just exactly at eight hours here i will

3330
07:59:21,419 --> 07:59:37,400
see you i'm not even gonna move from this spot well i am but the character is not so tomorrow

3331
07:59:37,400 --> 07:59:42,549
uh i'm just gonna whenever i get up and get going we're gonna go again i'm not gonna play

3332
07:59:42,549 --> 07:59:49,130
without what are you talking about when have i ever done a from software game on stream

3333
07:59:49,770 --> 08:00:02,150
and didn't finish it no wait i'm gonna try to get through the whole thing dark souls 2 i didn't

3334
08:00:02,150 --> 08:00:09,369
know but dark souls 2 was i already beat dark souls 2 twice before that stream even started

3335
08:00:09,369 --> 08:00:13,990
demon souls i beat all the demon souls on stream all dark souls 1 all dark souls 3

3336
08:00:13,990 --> 08:00:24,360
we have no evidence of that i can show you steam achievements that would count long story short

3337
08:00:24,360 --> 08:00:34,409
i'm gonna give this a yes out of all right my final rating will have to come later

3338
08:00:43,369 --> 08:00:47,450
definitely two thumbs up if you are on the fence oh i'm not so sure they went a different direction

3339
08:00:47,450 --> 08:00:57,430
it's great if you like smashing your face against a wall over and over again and eventually putting

3340
08:00:57,430 --> 08:01:02,869
on both pants and tightening up your belt i'm achieving great victory in a hard video game

3341
08:01:02,869 --> 08:01:14,360
absolutely it's fantastic so uh let's actually put on the outro screen hopefully by tomorrow

3342
08:01:14,360 --> 08:01:18,439

the same thing for neo the one and only time i played that i was drinking a bottle of whiskey

3447
08:21:07,000 --> 08:21:18,889

3450
08:21:38,459 --> 08:21:48,599
you hang out there a lot of like-minded people hopefully that over the over the months and years

3451
08:21:49,560 --> 08:21:52,680
you can find somebody to hang out there somebody that can

3452
08:21:57,400 --> 08:22:10,619
chill with you we should make it called i don't think that's a good idea it's a very bad idea

3453
08:22:13,459 --> 08:22:17,380
but take care of yourself i wish you the best thank you so much for the 250

3454
08:22:20,919 --> 08:22:29,639
like-minded indeed we all eat an equal amount of glue now i eat way more i eat the most

3455
08:22:30,279 --> 08:22:37,930
smelly boy thanks for the 250 how would you feel if you found out uh that death consisted entirely

3456
08:22:37,930 --> 08:22:43,049
of an eternity where the only thing you can perceive is germa defoe in front of you you

3457
08:22:43,049 --> 08:22:48,490
cannot hear smell feel or taste anything just stare at germa defoe eternally with no perception

3458
08:22:48,490 --> 08:22:57,860
of anything else i don't think it matters what image it is any image would be terrible that could

3459
08:22:57,860 --> 08:23:05,930
be it could be a a puppy and after 200 millennia you'd be like get this fucking dog out of my face

3460
08:23:07,689 --> 08:23:11,529
it would start to morph you ever look in a mirror for long enough at yourself

3461
08:23:12,569 --> 08:23:17,450
if you just stare at yourself in a mirror for five minutes your eyes and your like teeth start to

3462
08:23:17,450 --> 08:23:26,250
morph imagine looking at yourself in a mirror 60 years straight thousand years straight don't

3463
08:23:26,250 --> 08:23:47,720
ever do that during a dream though are you high no just sick honey chain thanks with three bucks

3464
08:23:47,720 --> 08:23:51,959
hey germa just want to send you some love you away thank you thank you thank you thank you

3465
08:23:51,959 --> 08:24:01,029
we said super seal 250 i can see why you wouldn't want to but don't be afraid to turn on sub only

3466
08:24:01,029 --> 08:24:14,169
mode more often i like how chill it is more than the others yeah it i think it works sometimes

3467
08:24:16,419 --> 08:24:22,099
but i like having chat go crazy sometimes i like having chat react instantly and be able to look

3468
08:24:22,099 --> 08:24:33,720
over there and see something instantly from everybody right sub only mode all the time is

3469
08:24:33,799 --> 08:24:44,599
it's like paying to chat right and sometimes when there's i guess more than two three four five

3470
08:24:44,599 --> 08:24:49,959
thousand people who are chatting at the same time it can be necessary especially if stuff

3471
08:24:49,959 --> 08:24:55,799
starts to get out of hand or there's a big argument or a bunch of spam or something it's a good way to

3472
08:24:55,799 --> 08:25:09,930
kind of calm it down the low delay is amazing remember how it was before something would happen

3473
08:25:11,270 --> 08:25:16,549
and i would look over to the chat and it would take 10 to 15 seconds for me to see anything there

3474
08:25:17,270 --> 08:25:30,840
how did we manage before i don't even know but this is time and place for it like we said

3475
08:25:31,400 --> 08:25:39,299
talked about it already it might maybe it'll stay on for secure maybe maybe after another

3476
08:25:39,299 --> 08:25:44,950
six hours or so maybe i won't need it anymore we'll see it's not something i do all the time

08:37:51,110 --> 08:37:58,389
and then and then and then whatever is one on the lottery tickets whatever's one on the scratch

3546
08:37:58,389 --> 08:38:12,840
tickets right whatever it is that goes back into community subs i'm into that that sounds fun

3547
08:38:12,840 --> 08:38:26,979
it's gonna be zero is gambling on stream terms of service i don't know i don't know

3548
08:38:28,090 --> 08:38:37,259
i don't think so if it's legal right don't people play like blackjack on twitch can i

3549
08:38:37,259 --> 08:38:45,029
like scratch like 45 scratch tickets gambling is a category right i i guys i live in las vegas

3550
08:38:45,029 --> 08:39:02,310
it's definitely legal here me streaming doing scratch shots and i look if you want to be

3551
08:39:02,310 --> 08:39:06,389
completely and totally like oh you don't like tell it like the gambling thing you don't want

3552
08:39:06,389 --> 08:39:10,150
to like make it look like fun no no i'm gonna write on the screen like do not fucking ever buy

3553
08:39:10,150 --> 08:39:16,150
these i'm gonna write like the word mistake 12 times it's gonna be around the screen while we do

3554
08:39:16,150 --> 08:39:26,919
it it was i think that'll be fine i'll double check to make sure that would be like okay with

3555
08:39:26,919 --> 08:39:37,380
twitch so yeah we'll see what should it be for every death should it be a dollar or like five

3556
08:39:37,380 --> 08:39:47,430
dollars because one dollar scratch offs don't win shit they have the worst probability five

3557
08:39:47,430 --> 08:39:52,310
dollars is a pretty good medium i think oh that's gonna be expensive though i have to be careful

3558
08:39:52,950 --> 08:40:14,939
if i die a hundred times like 125 to 150 times i died like 10 times just to the butterfly lady

3559
08:40:18,470 --> 08:40:22,790
we're at 15 it's got it's more i think it's more than 15 deaths today only at least 10 of them

3560
08:40:23,590 --> 08:40:29,849
only 10 were in the last 40 minutes you tell me i only died five times over the course of that

3561
08:40:29,849 --> 08:40:40,729
first seven hours in a way i probably died at least five to six to ten more times probably like 25

3562
08:40:41,290 --> 08:40:53,290
yeah yeah not resurrects we're going true deaths actual you get the ending not resurrect game over

3563
08:40:54,009 --> 08:41:03,450
we'll see how it turns out that's a fun idea though thank you tingy uh that was a great idea

3564
08:41:11,080 --> 08:41:16,630
it might have to be one dollar scratch tickets because if i died more than a hundred times

3565
08:41:17,430 --> 08:41:24,340
i don't know fuck it whatever you know what i mean that would be fun let me do a little bit of

3566
08:41:24,340 --> 08:41:28,979
research on that but thank you germa lied about minecraft vr he didn't but thanks to 250 i know

3619
08:50:59,029 --> 08:51:04,869
and just pull up hit the brakes and get a bag of gross food and then you and you sit down you

3620
08:51:04,869 --> 08:51:09,029
eat it and you're like all right that was great just don't do it every day do it like once every

3621
08:51:09,029 --> 08:51:14,709
couple weeks or something and just enjoy it it's not gonna kill you you eating four cheesy gordita

3622
08:51:14,709 --> 08:51:21,259
crunches that's very bad for you but it's not if you do that like once a month or once every

3630
08:52:59,590 --> 08:53:07,990

3633
08:53:28,819 --> 08:53:44,200
as a wendy's dave single i would kind of just rather go to wendy's because at least at wendy's

3634
08:53:45,159 --> 08:53:56,580
i can get their spicy chicken nugget get the fuck off my coast re i'm not on a coast actually

3636
08:54:14,630 --> 08:54:21,669
but in and out is good look if we all liked the same things but i told you the squidward argument

3637
08:54:21,669 --> 08:54:28,310
already you want to eat canned bread and everybody loves the same place everybody eats the same food

3638
08:54:28,310 --> 08:54:38,860
everybody no i don't want to live in the squidward town what fast food mascot is the best

3639
08:54:39,659 --> 08:54:45,180
definitely definitely the king until they like killed him or something they got rid of him i

3640
08:54:45,180 --> 08:54:52,569
don't know why the scary king commercials were great where he was just like staring at people

3641
08:54:52,569 --> 08:54:58,150
and stuff it was like just so odd they still they still haven't i haven't seen him in a commercial

3642
08:54:58,150 --> 08:55:08,220
a long time yeah they killed him off in an episode one of the commercials and one of the

3643
08:55:08,220 --> 08:55:11,900
commercials he took like an arrow to the neck or something it was crazy he was wild you guys

3644
08:55:11,900 --> 08:55:13,259
remember don't remember that controversy

3645
08:55:29,909 --> 08:55:38,439
uh ronald mcdonald i feel like they just buried all these fast food cereal characters i haven't

3646
08:55:38,439 --> 08:55:45,419
when was the last ronald mcdonald commercial no they don't do that anymore guys every fast food

3647
08:55:45,419 --> 08:55:57,479
commercial is just two cool hip young people oh let me steal a fry oh delicious there's no

3648
08:55:57,479 --> 08:56:03,380
fucked up weird cartoon characters anymore the hamburger that doesn't get punched in the face

3649
08:56:06,069 --> 08:56:14,229
they tried here you go ready fast food commercials now are chilies and fridays commercials from 10

3650
08:56:14,229 --> 08:56:21,849
years ago look at all these people having like a great time they're sitting around dining in at

3651
08:56:21,849 --> 08:56:28,569
mcdonald's look at they're all smiling clinking glasses taking a big sip out of their drink nobody

3652
08:56:28,569 --> 08:56:41,299
gives a fuck no bring us our weird demented twisted cartoon characters they're all switch

3653
08:56:41,299 --> 08:57:02,779
commercials now and frankly i think it's bullshit what psycho goes to burger king to have a good

3654
08:57:02,779 --> 08:57:10,709
time i never noticed that they killed off a lot of the cartoon mascots till now yeah they did

3655
08:57:18,020 --> 08:57:22,259
uh you can say you can say what you want about kfc but at least kfc still has the

3656
08:57:22,259 --> 08:57:30,900
kernel in these commercials it's finger looking good my five dollar fill-up box is worth uh it's

3657
08:57:30,900 --> 08:57:44,180
waiting gold they still do that kfc sucks no it doesn't well then i'll level with you here

3658
08:57:45,479 --> 08:57:52,040
every other kfc sucks because sometimes you go to kfc and get a five star quality crispy delicious

3659
08:57:52,520 --> 08:57:59,479
uh perfect meal and then you go to the one down the street and it's like a lunch lady put pig

3660
08:57:59,479 --> 08:58:08,009
slop on your plate there is no in between kfc is either terrible terrible zero out of zero out of

3661
08:58:08,009 --> 08:58:16,119
five or perfect if they were more consistent i would eat there more often but they're just not

3662
08:58:22,900 --> 08:58:28,250
Popeyes is a lot better i've actually never had Popeyes i gotta change that

3663
08:58:31,450 --> 08:58:47,319
yeah i've never had it do they have Popeyes in vegas i don't know i think so order it right now

3664
08:58:48,040 --> 08:58:56,459
it's based off of the popular cartoon character of the same name

3665
08:58:57,340 --> 08:59:12,139
well wouldn't they serve spinach there Popeye didn't eat chicken he ate spinach it wasn't like

3666
08:59:15,180 --> 08:59:18,119
biting into like a big crispy chicken leg no he squeezed the

3667
08:59:19,080 --> 08:59:21,979
he squeezed the can as hard as he could and it shot out of the top

3668
08:59:25,450 --> 08:59:29,529
that marketing worked by the way i used to want to eat spinach so bad because

3669
08:59:29,529 --> 08:59:35,180
it looked so good when he ate it i was i didn't eat vegetables i hated them

3670
08:59:35,740 --> 08:59:39,979
it was very difficult for my parents to give me food that wasn't captain crunch

3671
08:59:40,700 --> 08:59:47,259
or like mac and cheese and a hot dog but holy shit that like propaganda campaign that they ran

3672
08:59:47,259 --> 08:59:59,319

two to three hours sometimes you know well i that's an over exaggeration it never took like three

3711
09:06:30,760 --> 09:06:39,699
hours but it's definitely taken about an hour off the time at the end so the last few streams have

3712
09:06:39,699 --> 09:06:45,559
been about 30 minutes two hours has happened three hours maybe maybe it's only happened once
