00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,529
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:23,030
And tonight, gonna be playing as the soldier with the black box, the shotgun, and the escape plan to run away from all the bad minions.

3
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,030
Anyways, guys, today we're gonna talk about something that I was thinking about today.

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,030
Actually, I thought about it last night, and I brought it up to Burger Boy. I was at Burger Boy's house.

5
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,770
We were sitting there, eating McDonald's, late night McDonald's, and we were watching the Olympic Games presentation, the opening ceremony.

6
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:45,770
If you don't know what the opening ceremony is for the Olympics, the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games, it's the country that's ever hosting it, whoever it is.

7
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,770
If it's Russia, United States, UK, and wherever it is.

8
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,270
They do this elaborate presentation where like, oh, Abraham Lincoln comes out with three women on his arms, and they sing the national anthem.

9
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,570
Like, they do this crazy presentation, and that's what we were watching. But forget about that. Forget I even said that. That's completely irrelevant.

10
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:12,049
It's about the Olympics, though, and how I think there's been talk about this before, right? I'm not the first person to bring this up.

11
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:20,590
But gaming at the Olympics, at least the Winter Olympics, because the Winter Olympics can promote a more indoor atmosphere,

12
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:27,590
because the Summer Olympics, as we all know, it's beach volleyball, it's swimming, it's all the cool, sunny outdoor activities,

13
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,090
where gaming's kind of just, we're all inside on a bunch of computers. But that's cool.

14
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,269
And I love the Winter Olympics. I love the Olympics.

15
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:40,769
It interests me the amount of things that some of these athletes can do with their triple axels and their,

16
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:48,269
oh my God, did you see that Ukrainian woman? She fell on her ass. And the American woman, like, threw up in the back room and it's on TV.

17
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:53,140
That type of stuff, that real drama, is really interesting to watch.

18
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,640
I feel the same way about watching football or basketball or baseball or any of those sports.

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Any competitive event is awesome. Because you can just, I can just sit back in my chair and have like a bag of fucking Doritos on my stomach

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,139
and watch these people do these incredible feats of human strength and mental ability.

21
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:19,139
And I'm just sitting there like, oh yeah, that was, that was really cool. I wish I could do that.

22
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:29,919
And I, that's fine for me. And I think if gaming were allowed into the Olympics, and I'm not just talking about video games,

23
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,919
I'm not just talking about playing like League of Legends in a tournament versus, you know,

24
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,419
Germany versus France or something for one of the competitions during the Olympics.

25
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:45,219
I'm talking about board games too. We're talking chess. We're talking checkers. We're talking Monopoly.

26
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:50,219
No, no, no. I'm just kidding. I'm not talking. Monopoly would be like fucking stupid in the Olympics.

27
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:56,389
Like, I'm talking about the mental awareness games, the ones that are really directly one-to-one competitive with people.

28
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:02,389
And there are a lot of board games, guys, that you and I have never even heard of that are very competitive,

29
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:09,389
very directly involved with a 1v1 or 2v2 situation. And can you imagine watching something like that

30
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:15,129
when there were gold medals on the line? And you bring that in alongside of video games?

31
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:20,370
I think you can spice up these Winter Olympics like crazy, because think of how many people actually watch

32
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,370
the tournaments for some of these video games. Now, I don't know if there's any real televised chess tournaments anymore.

33
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,370
I'm sure there are, and I'm sure there's a lot of places where you can go watch them.

34
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,870
If you really wanted to, there's probably a chess site that has all kinds of stuff like that.

35
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,370
But League of Legends. I'm going to use League of Legends as a complete example here.

36
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,800
Now, I don't play League of Legends. I don't really follow League of Legends, really at all.

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,800
But when I see something like this, it's pretty ridiculous and it really piques my interest into other things,

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,229
like talking about the Olympics. 32 million people watched the tournament, the championship game

39
00:03:55,229 --> 00:04:00,539
of that 2013 League of Legends tournament championship series. 32 million people.

40
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:07,210
How many people watched, like, the biathlon from the 2010 Winter Olympics? I don't know.

41
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,210
But if for some reason that number is insanely huge, if you come to me the comments section right now and you're like,

42
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,209
Hey, Jerma, the archery championship had 65 billion people watched.

43
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:23,509
Then obviously I would retract what I'm about to say. If a game like League of Legends can pull in that type of audience,

44
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:30,879
why shouldn't it be in something like the Olympics when eSports and when competitive gaming is getting more and more and more backing

45
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,120
and more and more and more support and more people that care than ever before?

46
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,120
I think we would see so many cool things if the Olympic Games allowed gaming.

47
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:50,490
Now obviously the main drawback to this whole argument, this whole theory, is there are a lot of different video games.

48
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,490
There are a lot of different, quote, games out there. Which ones would qualify?

49
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,490
And which ones are the ones that actually are very competitive, that deserve gold medals?

50
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,490
And that's not for me to decide. It's just something I was throwing on the table.

51
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,490
So if you're like a video game theory physicist and you can come up with those ideas,

52
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,860
and maybe in like five years or ten years or twenty years, however long it takes,

53
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,860
and if it ever happens, if it never happens, then you know, whatever.

54
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,860
But it's interesting to think about. I want to know what you guys have to say about this.

55
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,860
Leave a comment if you'd like to below discussing this further.

56
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,029
And I'll see you guys all next time. That's gonna wrap up the video.

57
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,029
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

58
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,509
And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
