00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:07,780
Hello everybody, welcome to my fancy boat party. I really appreciate everyone for co-

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,289
A party crasher.

3
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:40,280
Okay, that's- I think that's facing the wrong way.

4
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,649
It is.

5
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:45,270
Okay, but this road I'll be able to get.

6
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,189
Who shot? Who's shooting?

7
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,039
Is that a cop? Are you- are they cop- oh, okay.

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,159
I want them to come, because I want them to fly off this jump.

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:05,379
Oh, I missed it. I missed it.

10
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:28,620
God, this paramedic has no idea what he's doing. He's so confused. Oh, but that first guy.

11
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,859
I just saw him go straight up.

12
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,340
Please have another guy on a bike come down this road.

13
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,859
Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.

14
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.

15
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.

16
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,900
Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.

17
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,900
Let's try it at the same time. Ready? One, two, three.

18
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.

19
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Grunt, grunt, grunt.

20
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Grunt, grunt, grunt. You're not doing it.

21
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
I just- I forgot how it started.

22
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,900
You don't know how the national anthem starts?

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,900
I thought I knew, but I didn't want to start wrong. You'd be like, you're doing it all wrong. Why are you messing this up?

24
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Oh, you wouldn't be unlike most people that have to do it.

25
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,900
How many times have people screwed up the national anthem on, like, TV?

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,180
I might land- no. I thought I was gonna land in this boat.

27
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,180
Oh, I didn't even know you left. Where are you?

28
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,180
Look at what you did to me.

29
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,819
Oh, hold on. I know what I can do.

30
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:48,199
Yeah, let's just keep shooting at bikers until they do something.

31
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,199
Oh, there's a bike coming from behind.

32
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,509
Alright, so-

33
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,509
One of those guys is going.

34
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,900
Bingo, bingo. He's going.

35
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,539
No, I turned too much. No, no, no, no.

36
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:06,539
This doesn't concern you, other-

37
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,930
That didn't work.

38
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, that worked for nothing.

39
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:28,979
Oh, all that work.

40
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,979
Oh, down the drain.

41
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:36,229
The chase is on. There's another one.

42
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,729
Okay, you ready?

43
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:43,319
Hold on.

44
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,740
Oh, my.

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,740
It worked.

46
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,620
There's still coming.

47
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,620
Do it again. We gotta go on like this straight away right here too. Do it again.

48
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,620
Try to go faster, like a little bit faster. Try to get them so they have a lot of speed.

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,520
There we go.

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
This taxi.

51
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,019
This taxi.

52
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,019
Crazy taxi, man. What? They're just blowing up for no reason.

53
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,019
Oh, my God.

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Look at how awkward of a place I'm standing.

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Look at how awkward of a place I'm in, Sharma.

56
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,259
Oh, yeah? See you later.

57
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,259
Screw you.

58
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:40,259
You just gave me a place to stand.

59
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:50,759
Oh, he kept that going for a while.

60
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:58,889
I'm gonna land this. I'm gonna land this.

61
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:06,649
I look like I'm driving the bicycle and I'm just like, yeah, this is a good jump.

62
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,649
Yeah, this is a good jump.

63
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,649
Look at this jump right here. Yeah.

64
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,019
Oh, man. Did you see that jump?

65
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,769
Oh, look at that. Yeah.

66
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:21,420
Nice.

67
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,420
So have you boys ever been on top of the captain's quarters?

68
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,420
I'll tell you right now.

69
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420
You're in for a treat.

70
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,420
It is just absolutely beautiful. I know.

71
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,420
Listen, the only select few get to come up here and bask in the beautiful glory that is this top deck.

72
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,420
So what the hell was that?

73
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:43,899
No, that was so stupid.

74
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,899
I could hear you crashing into Sharma.

75
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,899
I could hear you crashing into everything.

76
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,899
What are you doing?
