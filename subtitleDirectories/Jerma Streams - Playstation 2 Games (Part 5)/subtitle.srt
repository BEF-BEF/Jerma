1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:12,019
Hey. Hey. Hey everybody. What? Oh, this is crazy. Homelands. I just saw you like earlier today.

2
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:20,570
Did I see you earlier? We ran into each other earlier today? That's weird. The same day. I

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,410
didn't know you shopped at this this grocery store. I just saw you at the gas station

4
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:31,109
earlier today. God, I would say, how are you? But we already talked about that.

5
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:44,780
Uh, welcome back everybody. It's true. I saw Jerma at the gas station and he went like this,

6
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:53,000
this, this. Uh, hi guys. Today, uh, we're going to continue the trend that we've had the last

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,820
three days. Uh, somebody just wrote, please tell me you're going to play Muppets Party Cruise.

8
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,909
I don't have that. I'm really sorry to tell you I do not have Muppets

9
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:17,209
Party Cruise. It's not like I put it in the title. Sometimes we forget about this.

10
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:26,980
There were four thousand PS2 games. I'm never going to play them all. All I can do

11
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:34,599
is just get through ones that I remember and ones that look interesting. Why not? He's lying.

12
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:47,769
Not with that attitude. Not with that attitude. No. And I don't just want to look,

13
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:50,810
okay, the same thing happened with the, uh, the VR stuff, right? Like I really want

14
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,310
to play a bunch of these and give them the time that they deserve. That's why we're

15
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,390
going back and forth because there's a shitload more VR stuff I want to do. We got to take a

16
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:08,740
break. We're getting ping ponged between VR and old console stuff. He's back. He knew my stream

17
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,219
was turning on, so he just drove his car by again. Hey, didn't I see you earlier today?

18
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,419
I thought I saw you earlier today at the gas station. He's back. I swear to God,

19
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:33,830
I live in a fucking video game simulation. Are you guys real? Anybody here real? No,

20
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,659
no, no, no. I think a lot of us know. Has ever anybody even asked the question to a bot like

21
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:49,319
that? Are you real? Like on Twitch? They have to answer correctly, right? AI has to give the

22
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:58,090
correct answer. That's actually kind of scary. Anyways, just letting people trickle in while

23
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:05,590
we hang out for a minute. Oops, that's a bunch of disks. Yeah, we're going to go back to VR

24
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,870
after obviously this weekend was PlayStation 2, and I did see quite a few people a little

25
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,939
bit angry with me for a good reason, because I did say yesterday that I was going to play,

26
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,659
hey guys, start with Clock Tower 3, and we're going to play a bunch of other shit.

27
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,979
And then I played Clock Tower 3 for nine hours and beat the whole game in one sitting.

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,300
I had a great time. I thought it was a fun stream. Hey, that just means we get to do

29
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:40,520
it again. You know what I'm saying? I thought that was a lot of fun. So speaking of fun,

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,039
I'm not sure what to start with today, because there's a chance that I might just get locked

31
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:54,120
into one of these. I'm thinking we start with... It's tough. I don't know. I don't

32
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,469
want the same thing to happen. The same thing can happen. Should we start off with Stuntman?

33
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:10,949
I can't get stuck in Stuntman. That's not possible. I also have Stuntman Ignition,

34
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:27,959
but I can't play that one first. Which one of them is better? Stuntman Ignition is so good.

35
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:38,089
No, but don't get me stuck here. Ignition is better. All right, well, let's get a taste of

36
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:46,540
the good one. Don't let me get stuck here. I will. Where's Metal Gear Solid 3? Actually,

37
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,300
I was talking to Italics about that the other day, about how that was my favorite Metal

38
00:04:50,300 --> 00:05:01,850
Gear game. Okay, here we go. We're going to play Stuntman Ignition. I would laugh my ass

39
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:09,029
off if this turns into a Stuntman Ignition, like, six and a half hour stream.

40
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:26,949
It's not going to happen. No, I have to play... I got 25 to life here that has to come up next,

41
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,949
but I might get lost in that. Look, it's all right. Even if I get lost in them. I got

42
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:44,250
PsyOps, Freedom Fighters. These are all classics. This is made by THQ, one of the

43
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:57,110
old glorious companies. Paradigm Entertainment. Black Screen. Shouldn't be Black Screen.

44
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:09,110
Every mangled mass of steel has a story to tell. Pretty good Spike TV intro we got going here.

45
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:24,550
So you're a movie actor in this, right? A tale of speed, guts, talent, style.

46
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,259
You're a Stuntman. Stuntmans are actors. They have to not only drive the car,

47
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:44,360
but they have to pretend to drive the car. They're gonna be in those camera shots.

48
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,079
They have to look like they're fucking really driving as hard as they can.

49
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:07,129
I thought I was watching an ad. Well, you kind of were. You kind of were watching an ad

50
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:12,389
for this game. Stuntman Ignition uses an auto-save feature. I'm actually probably

51
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:17,930
gonna run out of room on this memory card here. There's been a lot of eight megabyte

52
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:27,560
save datas over the last six months on this thing. Well, I guess not. That's gonna be a

53
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:38,089
problem though. All right. Stuntman Ignition. Career. Quick fix. Options. Audio controls.

54
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:44,230
Gameplay. Thrill cams. Oh, this game kind of looks terrible. It's really blurry.

55
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:58,360
This was the game that I properly raged at. Vibration off, always. 75, 75.

56
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:08,970
Arrows on. Okay, we're just gonna keep this shit here. I gotta read the manual, right?

57
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:22,519
This is like every PlayStation game. Okay, handbrake. Brake. Gas. Camera control.

58
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:29,620
Action. And then look right and look left. Isn't it nitro? Okay. Career. What are you

59
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:37,860
doing? Why are you saving every five seconds? Should have got the PlayStation 3 version.

60
00:08:38,820 --> 00:09:20,419
Uh-oh. Ricky Langston. Do I have to drive? Dude, I did it. That's an S. That was the audition.

61
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,389
That's a very expensive audition.

62
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,600
This guy's a real asshole.

63
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,679
I'm told this is your first time on a big set so I'll walk you through how it works.

64
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,919
We'll have you wired up in your vehicle and your coordinator will call out all the major

65
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,639
director stunts we need you to hit, okay? He'll also mark them on your heads-up display

66
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:01,799
with yellow stunt icons. These include drifts, gaps, jumps, closes, and other maneuvers. We'll

67
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,879
be using a point system to judge your runs. All the directors do it. It's how we keep track

68
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,600
of the drivers in the biz. More precisely you perform, more points you'll earn. Fail

69
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,879
We all use it.

70
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,879
Oh, do I get to have a strike here with the other stuntmen that are getting fucking abused on set?

71
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,559
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

72
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,139
There's another one.

73
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:50,419
This is Vegeta.

74
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:54,419
This is Christopher Seabot.

75
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,379
A huge finale where the town gets ripped apart.

76
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:19,059
Before each scene I'll give you shots of your key stunts with tips on how to pull them off.

77
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:22,899
Right now this stuntman is probably just sitting there with a dump in his pants like,

78
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:29,379
holy shit, this is my first day. I thought I was gonna have to put on a wig

79
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,059
and pretend to be an old lady and fall down in a crosswalk.

80
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:42,629
For your first scene you'll double for the town's trouble-making drifter in his R3000

81
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:47,990
as he flees the volcanic eruption. The highlight will be this huge jump over a burning semi.

82
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,909
The key is to hit the ramp straight. That'll set you up for the stunt that follows.

83
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,710
As soon as you land you'll have a pair of precision drivers coming at you fast and you'll

84
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,269
need to gap between them. It's dangerous so be careful and don't be afraid of retakes.

85
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,629
Mr Langston's a picky director and it can take a while to make him happy.

86
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:14,019
Okay um get up excuse me can I go to the bathroom first I kind of have to go to the bathroom

87
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,070
all right let's go three two one action gap the cars what what do you mean gap the cars

88
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,019
that was my first day this is a tricky set you need to watch out for those hazards

89
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,100
oh I thought I was supposed to jump hold on wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute

90
00:12:40,980 --> 00:13:02,019
I thought I was supposed to jump okay then we turn um what if you destroy the whole town

91
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:11,049
what what oh yeah well we were not authentic we uh we we put a bunch of like hydrochloric

92
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:15,690
acid in a local volcano it wiped out fucking like an entire village but let's at least

93
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:31,909
we got it for the shot right god damn right that was good all right um so

94
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,450
I feel like this game's playing in slow motion

95
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:46,519
this is like 640 by 480 it's so blurry in my screen and it's playing at like

96
00:13:47,559 --> 00:14:11,820
18 frames a second oh I got it got it they're killing people seriously what the

97
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:36,860
fuck is going on here what how many stunts do I have to do these aren't stunts okay I'm

98
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:57,620
sorry but you are just dropping molten bombs on these people that was too boring too boring

99
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:05,100
you're gonna have like a dead sea scrolls obituary for this 10 minute string here give me

100
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:23,450
a break I got a new car oh with this one we're gonna have you uh fucking jump over the uh

101
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,370
ocean your car's gonna get wings you're gonna fly past a plane be careful they go under the

102
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:33,690
plane what the hell are they doing stuntman ignition is all about stunt points and stunt

103
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,970
stringing is how you rack up the big numbers every stunt earns you points and goes into your

104
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,090
stunt string if you perform a stunt within two seconds of another stunt that will continue

105
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,850
your stunt string and add another number to your multiplier now your stunt stringing be

106
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,090
sure to watch your stunt indicator on the upper left it tells you what stunt you just

107
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,049
performed and how long you have until your string breaks you have to stunt before the string

108
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:04,330
fades out if it breaks your string will be cashed out and added to your total score on the right

109
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,450
what stunts continuous string all of them yeah throw a drift get close to anything in the

110
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,169
scene pass through a time gate hit a director stunt jump a ramp you get the idea look for

111
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:18,169
different ways or objects throughout the course to keep your string alive now if you

112
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:23,850
want that fifth star you're gonna have to string it that means keep a continuous string from your

113
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:30,169
first stunt to your last your total score should read zero if you string the entire level together

114
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:35,450
try the stringing rehearsal and see if you can do it and by the way after you do all this

115
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:40,169
the actor's gonna come out of their trailer go where you were at the time of the cut

116
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:50,409
say three sentences and then go back in their trailer what a fucking hard job string the

117
00:16:50,409 --> 00:17:14,200
scene action all right let's string it how do i handbrake oops on the car something's wrong

118
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:33,579
with the car the drift is what jump god damn it do it again do it again do it again all right

119
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:47,420
it's not as much as a drift as it is a hard stop yeah that's not really a drift

120
00:17:48,059 --> 00:18:09,859
this would be good done there's more no there's not okay passed next scene all right

121
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:14,420
today's run will be the drifters last scene when he tries to escape the town and gets torched by a

122
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,619
lava boulder at the end the feature stunt is the pyro charge as you cross over a certain

123
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,259
lava fissure in the ground which will mark on your HUD trigger the charge and set your car on

124
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:30,019
fire get hot but you'll be wearing a cool suit once you're lit drift hard to the right

125
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:36,019
and gap through the car wash that'll extinguish the car wash onto the big finale remember kid

126
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:40,660
watch out for that lava yeah by the way our director is a real fucking psycho

127
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:52,140
he's decided to make a mouse trap in real life there aren't any actors here so what was

let's talk motorcycles kid directors love them because they're fast and loud and punch to any

146
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,180
scene but they're also harder to control more dangerous so watch out or they'll be mopping

147
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,859
your skull off the pavement there are two major stunts unique to the bike first is the wheelie

148
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:49,980
it's a great way to start any motor run and keep your strings alive pull back on the left

149
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,059
analog stick as you hit the gas pull back that front wheel and while you hit the gas push

150
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,900
forward to drop back down then there's the slide to pull it off perform the action as

151
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,059
you pass through the designated stunt box okay that'll make you lay the bike down on

152
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:10,220
one side while you're still barreling forward so in the box how do you do the slide is simple

153
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:17,349

184
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:17,400
town and up to his grandmother the big moment here comes early in the run

185
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,240
when you take the ramp over a major drop and smash through a burning billboard

186
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:26,440
keep in control when you land so you can navigate across the fiery rooftops

187
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,680
and take the smaller jump that follows you'll really be putting your body on the line here

188
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:36,039

217
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:10,900

218
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,139
they want because of course they sign our checks you'll mostly double for the creek

219
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:19,300
boys and their signature muscle car the general creek boys try to stop the corrupt

220
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,139
sheriff from foreclosing on their family's land you'll also have a scene on a dirt

bike as the crazy brother otis a fun scene is uncle cletus in his monster truck full of moonshine

222
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:33,860
and a great run as a bank robber in a hijacked armored truck this will be your first time to

223
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:38,659
shoot chase scenes so be sure not to fall too far behind the lead car or we'll have to stop

224
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:43,059
and reset most of the action happens in the town square but we've also got some exciting

225
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:47,940
stunts planned in the junkyard and in the lumber yard faxter and his crew are all about

monster truck and he's trying to escape the cops big thing here are the crushing stunts

229

when you see a crush icon drive your crush over the marked car to smash it

230
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,420
this is a tightly choreographed run and if the icon turns red that means the cars left

231

the shot and you've blown your chance what it's about it let's start this movie right

275
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:12,090
say in the days of its infancy the stunt performer's profession was pioneered by the

276
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:19,050
daring and ingenuity of acrobats and circus acts as the public's demand for on-screen chases

277
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:26,489
crashes jumps smashes and explosions is never satisfied so the stunt performer has evolved into

278
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:33,690
a highly trained professional this is real footage for the timid this is where men and women

279
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,449

293
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:58,659
thing to a moving automobile in that whole trailer for driver three he'd think he'd say no

294
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:13,320
but we push it right to the edge the whole commercial play it's on the playstation 3 e

303
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:55,460
that was going to happen i might get clipped and then get shown on the internet somewhere on my

304
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,059
community of people they've taken me out of context and clipping me saying something stupid

305
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,710

310
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:55,130
actor could bring to the game what accelerate 180 apparently that didn't work all right the

311
00:58:55,130 --> 00:59:08,059
e-brake is way more sensitive in the original version it's even crustier i mean you're talking

312
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:16,460
about you on your special instructions on your online order at pizza hut you said leave it in

313
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:32,809

315
00:59:57,929 --> 01:00:15,539

316
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:24,550
it's square in this one no it's not is it really it's triangle in this one where they

317
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:37,429

318
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:42,869

01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:21,980
from europe and drive those we'll actually control the cars with mini steering wheels

327

03:05:24,620 --> 03:05:29,979
inventory supply select to access inventory power-ups can restore health and psi energy

872
03:05:30,860 --> 03:05:39,739
okay search the compound for more power-ups so i select this i can use that no reason

873
03:05:39,739 --> 03:05:50,620
me to use it right now pistol ammo and just okay you can just boot shit anything in these

874
03:05:50,620 --> 03:06:16,649
enemies nothing no oh it hurts so bad this is when i get my psychic brain powers

875
03:06:17,770 --> 03:07:01,110
okay so stealth i have to be quiet in real life too enemies can see what did that say press to

876
03:07:01,110 --> 03:07:07,739
lock onto an enemy or object wait wait wait so i can hold the button down to strafe

877
03:07:07,739 --> 03:07:16,649
so the triangle is to lock on somebody did i i locked on in it and he no what i'm trying

878
03:07:16,649 --> 03:07:35,379
just to fucking figure out how to control the game how are you still living after that

879
03:07:36,180 --> 03:08:08,709
i have one bullet left how do i switch guns didn't i get pistol ammo yeah okay so i can

880
03:08:08,709 --> 03:08:24,100
strafe my whole triangle it's time to kick something maybe well nobody else even down here

881
03:08:24,100 --> 03:08:36,459
so we've been playing shoot man games uh well this is this game is not a shoot man game

882
03:08:37,100 --> 03:08:44,870
this is the first little area and then you turn into a psychic the force unleashed maniac

883
03:08:56,500 --> 03:09:00,500
it's too bad that stump man too was so fun but it was too crusty and i can get the better version

884
03:09:00,500 --> 03:09:18,649
of it uh anything else i can do any more stuff to look at i don't think so all right give me

885
03:09:18,649 --> 03:09:30,170
the silence gun stepping over metal or puddles will alert your enemies short rapid shoot short

886
03:09:30,170 --> 03:09:53,430
rapid shots or burst fire is can i at least read the tutorial i gotta heal uh this is a

887
03:09:54,389 --> 03:10:25,989
25% health 50% health watch the greats don't worry i promise i'll do that to somebody

888
03:10:25,989 --> 03:10:47,579
need a key card anybody coming don't step on the grate critical body parts can be maybe like

889
03:10:47,579 --> 03:11:26,969
this key card let's move that guy sucked okay where is she laughing my ass off what took you

890
03:11:26,969 --> 03:11:32,809
so long where'd they take my squad that didn't take very long at all but you're not

891
03:11:32,889 --> 03:11:38,170
ready nick you have to recover your abilities i'm ready to go now you need to find something

892
03:11:38,170 --> 03:11:45,979
he just fucking sucks laughing my ass off oh don't do that to me again don't you

893
03:11:50,250 --> 03:11:55,209
it's for your own good the hell it is it was just air it was just air calm down

894
03:11:55,209 --> 03:12:00,579
i'm inside the movement as a double agent i can keep helping you as long as i don't get caught

895
03:12:00,579 --> 03:12:05,139
what did you give me first things first you don't have security clearance but if you

896
03:12:05,139 --> 03:12:10,100
trip the switch all security beams will go down then you can make your way to the elevator

897
03:12:10,100 --> 03:12:16,069
to get to the second floor here's the keys the generator here's my american express before they

898
03:12:16,069 --> 03:12:21,159
discover you've escaped be careful where you use it though because nobody takes it anymore

899
03:12:21,879 --> 03:12:48,420
let me get my institute for that come on what's in your wallet not like this my gate

900
03:12:48,420 --> 03:12:55,129
training facility 12 years ago telekinesis training here we go all right nick let's start

901
03:12:55,129 --> 03:13:01,450
your telekinesis training to keep it simple i'm going to start referring to telekinesis as tk from

902
03:13:01,450 --> 03:13:08,010
now on tk also we've juiced you up with unlimited psi powers during this test hey thanks in the

903
03:13:08,010 --> 03:13:15,590
real world all psi powers drained with you we'll skip the spoon binding and start by

904
03:13:15,590 --> 03:13:23,989
controlling tk5 first select a target to tk by moving the aim retapool over the object first

905
03:13:23,989 --> 03:13:27,989
always refer to the hut for control instructions stand at the edge of the map

906
03:13:28,790 --> 03:13:33,750
and do tk pulse to the three friends you're playing with it's guaranteed that you'll

907
03:13:33,750 --> 03:13:36,950
fucking annoy the hell out of them and they won't want to play with you anymore

908
03:13:37,989 --> 03:13:47,110
okay target object with aim okay pressing hold l1 select and lift ob so l1 is selecting

909
03:13:47,110 --> 03:13:53,639
the lift object and right analog stick if you haven't figured it out nick the telekinesis

910
03:13:53,639 --> 03:13:59,479
button is pressure sensitive so the pressure applied determines the height of lift i got

911
03:13:59,479 --> 03:14:03,799
that's not going to work with my shitty mad cats controller to continue your training

912
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:12,340
do i even have that my pressure sensitive button is not that's not going to work

913
03:14:17,319 --> 03:14:23,399
all right nick next i want you to get over this wall it's too high for you to jump a

914
03:14:23,399 --> 03:14:31,850
climb over so use tk to arrange and stack so you admit press and hold l1 to select

915
03:14:31,850 --> 03:14:40,420
and lift object move object with the right analog stick and release it uh yeah so i'm just

916
03:14:40,420 --> 03:14:57,420
gonna jump over them okay that's easy enough why do i have two two minutes and 43 seconds

917
03:14:57,420 --> 03:15:10,899
today i just tried to jump come on why are you turning to the left climb it nice climbing

918
03:15:10,899 --> 03:15:16,180
nick i want you to use telekinesis to move a crate through each hole in the wall this

919
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:21,139
is just destroy all humans but with less hey laughing my ass off don't throw the

920
03:15:21,139 --> 03:15:25,139
crate easily first get a crate through the hole on the lower left

921
03:15:32,500 --> 03:15:37,659
move crate through the hole press the yeah until it's at the desired height move the object with

922
03:15:37,659 --> 03:15:58,229
the right analog stick mm-hmm god damn god damn it guys i don't think i can play this with

923
03:15:58,870 --> 03:16:27,540
dumb bootleg controller okay let's try it again what i want you to use telekinesis to move

924
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:42,250
oh the left hole okay i'm pressing it as lightly as possible i think it can i oh man this is

925
03:16:42,250 --> 03:16:55,510
gonna be hard to do all right i can get it now move a crate through the hole in the center

926
03:16:56,389 --> 03:17:09,989
i can get the ones that are tall now pick up a crate for the last hole

927
03:17:11,299 --> 03:17:18,549
okay the multi lift high for a normal tk lift you will need to use a technique called tk

928
03:17:18,549 --> 03:17:24,069
multi lift refer to the herd to walk you through the technique release lift an object

929
03:17:24,069 --> 03:17:29,030
to its maximum height release l1 then quickly press and hold l1 again to lift an object

930
03:17:29,030 --> 03:17:43,959
higher okay so you go like this and then you it's all the way at the top okay come back this

931
03:17:43,959 --> 03:17:56,170
way good job the next section is through the door behind you now to the good stuff let's use

932
03:17:56,170 --> 03:18:01,209
telekinesis to throw objects at live targets but don't worry these guys can't wait this is

933
03:18:01,209 --> 03:18:08,090
gonna be great first use tk to throw a crate at the stationary test subject these guys just

934
03:18:08,090 --> 03:18:14,870
stump man with the right analog stick in the direction of test subject and then release l1 to

935
03:18:14,870 --> 03:18:15,750
throw object

936
03:18:25,030 --> 03:18:33,770
now try and hit a moving target okay well i doubt i got it that guy was moving

937
03:18:34,489 --> 03:18:45,750
this guy's just trying to run away now isn't it finally try to hit a moving on an irregular

938
03:18:45,750 --> 03:18:58,309
oh please god don't hit me got him now that you you can also tk most enemies

939
03:18:58,309 --> 03:19:03,350
take up that guy and throw him against the wall a few times his weapon will drop after he

940
03:19:04,069 --> 03:19:23,180
dies okay let's try it again that was cool oh god damn it now to the good

941
03:19:32,180 --> 03:19:39,110
now killing people in training that's good fun isn't it it is good fun you're right

942
03:19:39,110 --> 03:19:49,989
trying to hit a target moving on an irregular path oops no no shake the gun out of this guy

943
03:19:51,590 --> 03:20:04,739
that didn't count no no no no no no let you practice throwing objects you can all

944
03:20:04,819 --> 03:20:09,860
right from against the wall pick up that guy and throw him against the wall a few times

945
03:20:09,860 --> 03:20:16,600
his weapon will prop damn keep throwing them into walls this is not even a training exercise

946
03:20:16,600 --> 03:20:23,770
that guy just shot actual bullets at me now tk the next time and while he's in the air

947
03:20:23,770 --> 03:20:39,270
use your weapon to shoot it so i did the first guy you've got it nice okay fun there's

948
03:20:39,270 --> 03:20:44,149
another gun right in front of you nick target it and tk throw it to yourself to collect the ammo

949
03:20:44,950 --> 03:20:53,299
oh that's cool all right let's see how you handle a live combat situation soldiers will charge

950
03:20:53,299 --> 03:20:58,420
into the room and attack you from all sides try and use cover while eliminating the threats

951
03:20:59,909 --> 03:21:05,670
use the explosive barrels to your advantage you can also use the assault rifle but don't rely on

952
03:21:05,670 --> 03:21:11,750
your gun kill the designated number of enemies using tk in some way you have limited health and

953
03:21:11,750 --> 03:21:17,829
tk firearm kill five enemies using tk within the time limit use assault rifle if needed

954
03:21:18,629 --> 03:21:44,540
and you can shield yourself behind objects all right oh shit you can throw them into the

955
03:21:44,540 --> 03:22:18,819
barrels dead who's left oh fuck i died i got too i kicked right in the chest there's

956
03:22:18,819 --> 03:22:26,629
another gun right in front i was having too much fun all right killed five enemies didn't i

957
03:22:26,629 --> 03:23:12,860
didn't kill five people how is that possible got him into his friend there's another guy

958
03:23:13,659 --> 03:23:31,620
sometimes i feel like it doesn't work when i let go nice work squad maybe someday you'll

959
03:23:31,620 --> 03:23:54,469
be as good as me right into the box that dude's gonna be a boss probably when you get killed

960
03:23:54,469 --> 03:23:58,709
you may choose to continue from the most recent checkpoint that was reached if you wish to save

961
03:23:58,709 --> 03:24:05,190
your progress like the save checkpoint option from the pause menu okay uh you create a new

962
03:24:05,190 --> 03:24:10,739
save that resumes play at the safe checkpoint so just gotta pause and hit save game don't

963
03:24:10,739 --> 03:24:23,799
let me forget that so now i got my pk powers let's put them to good use so i have a key

964
03:24:23,799 --> 03:24:27,319
card now that was gonna where was that gonna take me do i have a map or anything yeah

965
03:24:29,719 --> 03:24:36,969
so i need to go uh where am i approximate location so i need to go

966
03:24:38,809 --> 03:24:50,229
down to the generator room or actually straight ahead maybe yeah already law i just i'd spent a

967
03:24:50,229 --> 03:24:54,840
i just did like an entire tutorial i don't remember what the hell the last thing i was

968
03:24:54,840 --> 03:25:02,420
supposed to do was checkpoint is straight ahead so the objectives of the green things

969
03:25:03,219 --> 03:25:17,899
okay oh there's even more i can only afford one color you picked green this is like every

970
03:25:17,899 --> 03:25:29,659
room uh all right i actually don't know what the fuck i'm supposed to do that cut scene felt like

971
03:25:29,659 --> 03:25:51,290
ages ago ow i just jumped into the laser grid whoops so i gotta turn that off just look at

972
03:25:51,290 --> 03:26:05,159
the map again do i have to turn that shit off i mean that's the this this was on the objective

973
03:26:05,879 --> 03:26:12,459
is there anything else i need to do in here no no no it's the room before this

974
03:26:13,989 --> 03:26:24,950
i can't believe i just have to heal now tk the laser i don't think that'll do anything

975
03:26:25,590 --> 03:26:35,850
okay wait is there was a room here wasn't there what was this this is that room with

976
03:26:35,850 --> 03:26:53,159
the guy's head okay so we have to go this way so then from here i could go down

977
03:26:54,040 --> 03:27:10,659
fucking mad cats it's not even a mad cat's controller anyways it's not a mad cat's

978
03:27:10,659 --> 03:27:30,600
controller i don't even know what it is fucking of course i can't i can't do a light

983
03:29:03,879 --> 03:29:36,389
oh that waterfall is so loud i can't even hear anything oh i went down there too it was very

984
03:29:36,389 --> 03:29:52,120
unnecessary but i had to do it shut them off they're too loud good job nick what the hell is

985
03:29:52,120 --> 03:29:59,559
this where are you i'm speaking to you inside your mind through telepathy telepathy those

986
03:30:00,120 --> 03:30:05,959
that work for the general is it is so spooky nick hurry get a key card in the

987
03:30:05,959 --> 03:30:11,719
guard room to use the elevator key card from the guard room new objective

988
03:30:14,250 --> 03:30:21,379
so i can go through the i'll just open the laser door

989
03:30:23,930 --> 03:30:39,540
let's go this way just using her chakra well didn't know you were gonna be here wait barrel

990

fucking god damn it how am i able here we go this brings us back here we need to go

992
03:34:02,420 --> 03:34:12,379
oh look at the map so i need to go to the guard room where's the guard room generator room

993
03:34:12,379 --> 03:34:23,700
guard room is right through here at least it should be guard room upstairs where's the guard

994
03:34:23,700 --> 03:34:43,979
room no i'm not in the right place destroy all humans this is not correct this is back in the

995
03:34:44,540 --> 03:34:59,899
playroom how do i get i gotta go to the elevator how do i get to the this section

996
03:34:59,899 --> 03:35:09,770
here security lower silo i think i was supposed to stay down there shit was i supposed to stay down

997
03:35:09,770 --> 03:35:37,750
there what the hell am i now shotgun that's my secret item i think i did that's pretty cool

998
03:35:38,549 --> 03:35:53,139
best weapon of the game really that's pretty cool all right so if i go up this way

999
03:35:53,780 --> 03:36:03,590
just out of curiosity i wonder if i let's start here

1000
03:36:04,389 --> 03:36:17,530
uh that's like the beginning of the game does take me anywhere well i thought that was a person

1001
03:36:17,530 --> 03:36:28,500
he threw a gun away with full ammo yeah but i got the new secret loot one what's that

1002
03:36:29,540 --> 03:36:37,829
i think i came back there what was your favorite weapon in halo 3 um i don't know

1003
03:36:37,829 --> 03:36:39,110
this is yeah this is just back at the beginning

1004
03:36:43,049 --> 03:36:46,409
the default assault rifle that you get at the beginning of the game that's the only

1005
03:36:46,409 --> 03:37:04,090
weapon i think i've ever seen in that game all right this is the cell okay which i just keep

1006
03:37:04,889 --> 03:37:20,180
i don't know where the fuck i'm supposed to go this is the guard room

1007
03:37:29,959 --> 03:37:35,799
huh there's so many halo boomers in the chat

1008
03:37:37,319 --> 03:37:51,879
it was a celebrated franchise yeah where's that go a guard room is can i go down for

1009
03:37:51,879 --> 03:38:12,459
an elevator or something it's a total college game bro it was go down from here and now i

1010
03:38:13,819 --> 03:38:22,040
have no idea i i haven't been there i've been okay found it found it got it got it got it got

1011
03:38:22,040 --> 03:38:41,670

1013
03:38:58,180 --> 03:39:20,840
what remote viewing enabled manga anime netflix adaptation in the the big brain exploding

1014
03:39:23,180 --> 03:39:29,020
now it's time to learn remote viewing or rb for short remote viewing is an out-of-body stealth

1015
03:39:29,020 --> 03:39:34,620
skill that allows you to go through doors and around obstructions when using rb you won't be

1016
03:39:34,620 --> 03:39:40,780
able to attack press the remote viewing button then move around like you normally would press

1017
03:39:41,579 --> 03:39:48,620
nice mean remember nick you can go right through doors take a walk through walls now use rb to

1018
03:39:48,620 --> 03:39:53,979
help find the computer terminal that unlocks the door so left to activate rv use the left

1019
03:39:53,979 --> 03:39:59,340
analog stick to move find computer terminal psi energy drains faster while moving in an rv

1020
03:40:00,940 --> 03:40:37,180
i thought i thought i could go through walls oh i hate this oh can i never use this i'm

1021
03:40:37,180 --> 03:40:46,409
never going to use this ability in the whole game this is what it feels like you guys want

1022
03:40:46,409 --> 03:40:59,559
to know what it feels like to be blackout drunk it's like that this is what it's like

1023
03:40:59,559 --> 03:41:06,340
you don't want to be like this now move ahead and exit the door by the terminal to get to

1024
03:41:06,340 --> 03:41:28,790
the next test my eyes kind of hurt actually after that next test why would you put a red

1025
03:41:28,790 --> 03:41:33,590
barrel there use remote viewing to observe the path of a god find cover and keep your

1026
03:41:33,590 --> 03:41:42,569
body hidden while you're in rv pk mine migraine find cover in high press left activate rb

1027
03:41:42,569 --> 03:41:51,219
use rb to observe enemy behavior so let's get the cover i don't have to okay i can

1028
03:41:51,219 --> 03:42:05,590
activate it like here all right rv observe enemy behavior press x to continue he's putting salt

1029
03:42:05,590 --> 03:42:19,479
all over the is he gonna see me i was spotted who oh that guy i tried to get away from i

1030
03:42:19,479 --> 03:42:34,180
thought i could go up really close next use remote i didn't want to do this part there you go

1031
03:42:35,399 --> 03:42:56,260
he walks around the corner and then surrenders and i got caught no you did he got caught all

1032
03:42:56,260 --> 03:43:17,319
right cool shit can i pull out now now sneak attack and eliminate his enemy from behind the

1033
03:43:17,319 --> 03:43:24,040
close range without being discovered so now i know what his route is he comes around here

1034
03:43:24,040 --> 03:43:59,860
and he looks this way let's see wait for him gotta wait for his route hello turn around got

1035
03:43:59,860 --> 03:44:13,379
yeah give this guy a medal nice work what's next this one's easy nick rb into the next room

1036
03:44:13,379 --> 03:44:18,500
and watch the enemy's patrol movement then sneak past the enemy without being detected

1037
03:44:24,899 --> 03:44:45,750
what how am i supposed to sneak past you're good at that sneaking around stuff now let's

1038
03:44:46,309 --> 03:44:52,709

1039
03:44:52,709 --> 03:44:55,670
take out both guys undetected to get to the final test

1040
03:45:01,340 --> 03:45:21,719

excited does it exist nick you're starting to remember who you really are are you saying

1077
03:57:23,260 --> 03:57:27,819
i've been brainwashed it's an awful idea memory to hide your psi abilities from

1078
03:57:27,819 --> 03:57:32,379
the movement probes when you were captured the shot i gave you should help reawaken your

1079
03:57:32,620 --> 03:57:38,219
powers no this is crazy deny it all you want but how else can you explain well i'm still going

1080
03:57:38,219 --> 03:57:43,659
after my men it's too late they're being processed into soldiers for the movement

1081
03:57:43,659 --> 03:57:56,360
they're probably being converted as we speak my men would never what press select move j what

1082
03:57:56,360 --> 03:58:03,459
did that cut off explore the movement's compound and locate the rest of your squad

1083
03:58:04,420 --> 03:58:38,389
oh god please let's go okay nick let's learn about mind drain also referred to as md

1084
03:58:38,389 --> 03:58:43,909
mind drain absorb psionic energy from another person's brain next game resident champ

1085
03:58:46,260 --> 03:58:51,139
we'll start off with the basics eliminate this guard however you'd like then i'll tell you

1086
03:58:51,139 --> 03:59:02,870
how to drain okay kill the guard i'm not gonna lie i wasn't even looking at the screen i'm

1087
03:59:02,870 --> 03:59:16,520
looking at one of the game i had here i can't pick him up i couldn't pick him up

1088
03:59:16,520 --> 03:59:23,559
close to the body then press and hold the mind drain button so r2 is mind drain the drain will

1089
03:59:23,559 --> 03:59:28,680
end automatic draining a dead body only replenishes part of your energy okay to replenish

1090
03:59:28,680 --> 03:59:33,239
all of your energy you need to drain a live target we'll try that in the next group so

1091
03:59:33,239 --> 03:59:37,399
electrocute somebody's brain till you suck out other energy got a live target now you can

1092
03:59:37,399 --> 03:59:42,200
only drain a person who is unaware of your presence sneak up on the enemy from behind

1093
03:59:42,200 --> 03:59:50,059
until you get close then perform the mind drain sneak up press and hold r2 to execute

1094
03:59:50,059 --> 04:00:10,100
mind drain until he dies you gotta be real close those guys will never get ahead with

1095
04:00:10,100 --> 04:00:16,260
that job sorry let's move on that was pretty brutal who are these people that we're doing

1096
04:00:16,260 --> 04:00:21,139
this to now for something a little tough i want you to sneak up behind each of these guards

1097
04:00:21,139 --> 04:00:28,420
and mind drain them until they pop without being detected by either one go for it so blow up their

1098
04:00:28,420 --> 04:00:48,969
brains all right i'll give it a try what a horrible way to go just microwaving that guy's

1099
04:00:48,969 --> 04:01:16,840
brain nice job nice yeah nice nice work excellent next you replenish your power or die

1100
04:01:17,239 --> 04:01:23,590
oh pretty matter of fact there boss for this last test i'm going to deplete all of your

1101
04:01:23,590 --> 04:01:29,270
side energy to stop then use mind drain to replenish all of your energy within the time

1102
04:01:29,270 --> 04:01:34,469
limit anything goes nick do whatever it takes to get all of your side energy back

1627
06:15:50,919 --> 06:16:07,419

1637
06:17:49,479 --> 06:18:00,099
stream without warning yeah but i think to my defense the back of the box it makes it seem like

1638
06:18:00,099 --> 06:18:08,619
it's one of those interesting experiences where it actually says you have 12 hours the clock is

1639
06:18:08,619 --> 06:18:20,169
ticking i'm so glad i did not do that that would have been terrible sticks renegade thanks for

1653
06:20:10,169 --> 06:20:18,520
that has a recommendation throw it get get it in that discord channel i check that recommended

1654
06:20:18,520 --> 06:20:22,869
channel all the time so if there's something you like oh fuck i got a couple of games that

1655
06:20:22,869 --> 06:20:28,840
he would really like to play now it's not guarantee i'm gonna play them but that is the

1656
06:20:28,840 --> 06:20:34,919
appropriate place for you know suggestions because it's cleaner it's easier for me to see

1657
06:20:35,720 --> 06:20:45,849
i can just kind of scroll down and see it but i've used that and a lot of streams have

1658
06:20:45,849 --> 06:20:54,630
come from that recommended channel a lot of them war of the monsters is on ps4 that's cool

1659
06:20:55,779 --> 06:21:02,279
as like a digital download or something but thank you forodian appreciate it

1660
06:21:03,000 --> 06:21:12,500
the thing with the play this ps2 has so many games i could sit here for a month straight

1661
06:21:12,500 --> 06:21:16,919
and do this i'm not gonna do that because obviously i want to break it up you know a

1662
06:21:16,919 --> 06:21:21,159
couple of streams in a row dreamcast two or three streams come back to it maybe another

1663
06:21:21,159 --> 06:21:28,889
time later in the year or something ps2 come back to it another time because i don't want

1664
06:21:28,889 --> 06:21:36,169
to get burnt out on like old weird interesting games i'd rather do them a few times in a row

1665
06:21:36,169 --> 06:21:43,060
put it back in the box for a while come back but i will definitely be making another list

06:31:01,139 --> 06:31:07,689
back with two three or four different accounts over and over again that is actually against

1718
06:31:07,689 --> 06:31:24,250
terms of service so i just want to make sure everyone's aware of that that's just scary

1719

you can get banned off of all of twitch for that for your information can you really

1720
06:31:31,619 --> 06:31:39,909
