00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,949
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Nightmare House 2 Chapter 4. I probably should not be doing that because I need like the bullets to shoot people.

2
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:23,190
But this is Chapter 4, Operation I think is the name of this particular chapter.

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:30,879
You're probably going to see Nightmare House 2 Chapter 5, 6, and I believe 7. I think there's only 7 chapters.

4
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:39,880
You're going to see those more often than only Saturday now. I want to try and get through this series a little quicker so I can do more scary games on Saturdays.

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,490
So expect more Nightmare House 2 soon. But in the meantime, let's go.

6
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:52,439
Now I remember from last episode, there's a guy right here. No he's not.

7
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:58,320
What? Where is this guy? I swear to God, he was right there last time. Where is he? Where's my light?

8
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:07,670
That guy was right here. Yeah, okay, great. Glitching out of the side of the wall there.

9
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:21,629
Alright, where the hell am I going? What's going here? It's locked. Looks like there's only one way to go.

10
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:48,709
Hello? Elevator? No, don't work. Straight through here. No, just walk. No, no, this blue area thing. What's going on? What is happening right now?

11
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:59,859
I'm like breathing in gas. Get me out of here. Oh my God, please tell me there's an exit. There is.

12
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:13,610
Do I have like a gas mask or something? I don't think I do. Geez. Breathing in like somebody farted in that hallway. Oh, that was immature.

13
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:26,439
Maybe I can drink the Drano and get immune to it. Nothing even in here. Is this? No, this is like looks... Can I turn this off or something?

14
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:39,020
This looks like where it's originating from. Maybe. Just don't know. What if I shoot it a bunch of times? That's not going to do anything now, is it?

15
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:50,870
Okay, I have to go back out into like the gas room. Why am I stuck? Get out of my face.

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:09,169
About what? What? Oh my God. What a troll. Since when does this lady decide she can do that to me?

17
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:13,900
I thought she was like an automated hospital thing.

18
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,090
Okay, yeah.

19
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:35,539
I'm not contacting the main desk. I'm breaking into somebody's room and stealing their bed pan. I need to recharge the flashlight.

20
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:44,979
Somebody's bed is gone. I don't know why, but there's nothing in here. Let's keep going.

21
00:03:44,979 --> 00:04:00,280
This one? Anything in here? Oh, wow. This was a failed operation. If I do say so myself. Bullets, that's a good thing.

22
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:16,860
Hey, how are you, doctor? You are taking way too many hits than you should. Just go down. Only one place to go. Are you serious?

23
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:29,050
What? My God. Oh, it's all about tapping the... I'm out of bullets. I can't even... I'm out of bullets right now. I just said, I'm out of bullets.

24
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:41,579
Are you telling me I'm out of bullets right now? This is great. I only have three shots in this thing. Great. Fantastic.

25
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:49,180
That was a bad idea. You know what? When I shot those bullets in the very beginning, that was a huge mistake.

26
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,420
Because it's going to be like a mini boss. I'm going to have to kill him. It's going to take two or three bullets that I don't have.

27
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:07,310
Can this elevator work yet? Where the hell am I supposed to go? Yeah, I knew that was going to happen. I already knew that was going to happen.

28
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:14,310
You fooled me once. Shame on you. Fooled me twice. Shame on you again. Because you shouldn't be being mean to people like that.

29
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:26,579
And what's in that vent? Definitely have to go in that vent, but I'm not going to do it yet. I want to go down here first. Yep, it's locked. I could have guessed.

30
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:34,790
Vent time. And we all know how much I love going into vents. I love it. It's my favorite thing in the world.

31
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:46,660
Here we go. Vent time. If I can even get in there. Jump in there. Can I pick up one of these stacks of beds?

32
00:05:46,660 --> 00:06:02,250
You, bed. Go over there. Get up. Will you just fall over there? Oh wait, there's a chair. I can do this. That's much easier.

33
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:11,939
Alright, here we go. Get the gun out. Because this chicken bone is going to attack me.

34
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:27,430
I hate vents. Can I open this? Nope. Even my character is going...

35
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:43,290
God! Is he dead? What's he doing? We're like having a tea party. Oh, my whole face hurts from that.

36
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:55,800
Let's go. Am I going to drop down here? Not. Should I? What was that? There were just two dudes right there.

37
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,060
Should I keep going or should I drop down? I don't know. But I'm going to go this way just because...

38
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:13,439
What the hell is going on? What just hit me? What is going on? Am I stuck in here now? Where am I?

39
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:31,209
What is happening? Why am I sandwiched in here now? Am I here for eternity? I think I'm locked in here forever.

40
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:42,069
No, I'm not. I'm just an idiot. So I do have to go down here. Okay. Let's go. Come on. Break it.

41
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:56,540
You might be a fat guy. You can break through this, can't you? So what am I supposed to do? Go back? I can't even go back.

42
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:11,000
What is happening right now? It's like a maze. Do I put my hands on this to put my name on there?

43
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,860
Okay, so now it really is just messing with me. I thought for a second that things were wrong and they were.

44
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:27,110
No, back down in here, I assume, the place where I can't see anything. Isn't this where all the walls were closing in on me?

45
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,909
What's going on? Oh, my God. It's so dark in here. I have no idea what's going on. Please get me out of here.

46
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:47,539
I can't even. I can't. I bet you you guys can't. Hi. All right. Good. Friends.

47
00:08:47,539 --> 00:09:04,629
Okay. So I'm a patient of this hospital. At least I got like a crew now.

48
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:12,539
Before it was just me and some dumb doctor that didn't do anything. These guys are like SWAT team.

49
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:22,629
All right. Don't worry, bro. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's take out some zombies. Four guys. Oh, this is a squad.

50
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:30,740
Let's all go, buddies. You're all my friends. Look at all my friends, all my friends.

51
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:39,690
We're going to have so much fun. We are a squad of friends. At least I feel safer now. Did you hear that?

52
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,940
I didn't. It's a flare, though. I'm putting it down. Oh, hang on to that flare. Okay.

53
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:53,120
Good thing you told me that before I activated it. You guys shoot. You shoot. I don't want to use my bullets.

54
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,190
Yeah. See, I don't have to do anything. I don't. I can hold my fire. These guys can do it all for me.

55
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:06,929
What? What? What do you mean incoming? Oh, you guys have assault rifles. Why? Why are you so concerned?

56
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:17,460
Yeah, I'll light the way. I'm not even going to shoot one time. Oh, fine. I'll shoot. You know what? No, screw that.

57
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:26,899
Oh, these guys. These guys are bad shots. You guys have like automatic shotguns and assault rifles.

58
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:35,970
Maybe I should be shooting because they die. Oh, I think they are. One of them is down. Oh, crap.

59
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:47,139
That's not good. All right. I wait. Oh, that was a zombie. Or was it? I'm confused. Let's go this way. I think.

60
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:54,840
No, it's over here. Bullets, bullets, bullets, but flares everywhere. Yeah. Hey, check out my new fireworks.

61
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:02,860
Sick. Oh, my like frames per second are going down like crazy. My screen is like a lagging like nuts.

62
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:11,409
Which way are we going? This way? No, we're going this way. What the hell was that? It was like a spider.

63
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:26,919
Are we going after the spider queen? No, apparently not. We're going through this door. Get out of here.

64
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,919
That was a pretty, if I do say so myself, that was a pretty good reflex headshot. That was pretty sick.

65
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:39,620
No, take that out. I want my regular gun, but I don't want to shoot any bullets because I don't want to waste them.

66
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:53,190
Nice job, Jerry. It is all quiet. OK, I got to name these guys. Jerry, Steve, Rick and Dugan. Let's go.

67
00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:06,610
Hey, watch out, Dugan. I'm definitely going to forget those names and call them to completely different things later.

68
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:15,539
I knew that. I knew I knew I wasn't going to get to that door. I knew it. His name was Dugan. All right.

69
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:34,620
Let me look around. It's an empty open room. Oh, what's up there? Grab his gun. Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

70
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:45,360
Oh, it's these things. Finally, I get to see them. These little freaks. Oh, what are these things?

71
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:53,679
God, these things are wicked freaky. What is this? I'm running out of ammo with this.

72
00:12:53,679 --> 00:13:01,929
Probably shouldn't be just spraying all over the place. But you know what? You only live once.

73
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:11,580
I'm right. I don't know. Don't use those bullets. Just attack. Where am I? Oh, it's this stupid zombie.

74
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:23,639
Shoot him. Shoot this guy. What a way to just burn through bullets. Who did I lose? Did I lose Rick? What's going on?

75
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,460
What's going on? Oh, my God. There's so many. Where did he go?

76
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:45,029
Well, yeah, you go ahead. Run out of the room and leave me here for dead. Thanks a lot, guys. Oh, there's only one of you.

77
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:51,490
Hey, find a way to meet us, even though it's only one of you. I got the rest of you killed because I'm an idiot.

78
00:13:51,490 --> 00:14:06,980
I'm running around swinging an axe. Let's go down here. I guess I think where am I?

79
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:15,620
Down below the depths of hell. Chapter five. OK. Well, that was pretty intense.

80
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,620
A little gunfight there at the end. Thank you guys so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.

81
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,860
And like I said, chapter five is going to be probably in the next couple of days.

82
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,860
I want to get through this playthrough sooner than every week. You'll see another episode soon.

83
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,860
So, yeah, hopefully there's no jump scare right here in the very beginning. Oh, there is probably.

84
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,860
But yeah, I'll see you guys all soon. And of course, take care, everybody.

85
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,860
Oh, it's hot out. I got to get like some breeze from the fan.
