00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:08,089
Good afternoon. What's going on everybody? How are you?

2
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:16,949
Uh, right when I press the unmute button, there's a hundred community subs from an anonymous gifter.

3
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,589
An anonymous person just gave, uh, like a trillion dollars worth of money.

4
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:31,140
A hundred fucking community subs. Thank you for the hundred community subs.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,020
If you missed the interview, that was fun.

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,979
I don't typically do stuff like that, but it was a really good time.

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,409
Tyler's a really good dude. We've, that was a plan for like the last year.

8
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:51,429
So there was a year in the making just about, or at least like six or seven months.

9
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:56,729
It's on Valve News Network right now, if you haven't seen it.

10
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,359
We go over deep shit. Like what my first name is.

11
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,780
Never heard that one before. But hello, I am back.

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,239
After another absence, I seem to be taking more absences than streaming these days.

13
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,340
And I do apologize for that, but you know,

14
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,379
shit, you got to deal with shit half shit happens, right? You got life happens, right?

15
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:34,120
So we were making a return to the 3DO. I was going to do two 3DO days in a row.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,680
I did one and then I took off for a week.

17
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,280
But I'm here now. Good to go. Excited because the game we're about to play

18
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,760
is a game that this is like, what's the, this is going to suck because I'm going to say this.

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,000
And then everyone's going to be including me is going to be pissed off when this is the worst

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,959
game of the entire lot. Cause this is why I got the 3DO.

21
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,849
The next three games that you're going to see are the reason why I got this thing.

22
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:06,939
So let's hope they're okay.

23
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:14,620
An absolute shitload of community subs are coming in right now and I am going to address them.

24
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:16,580
Oh, that's a lot.

25
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,639
Non-descript civilian 10, John Cena is kill five, IA Elliot five, non-descript another 10,

26
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,280
Jamie two, eight, oh three, five, seven from nocturne, six from mystic quests,

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:40,969
and then $50 from Dupa, 5,000 bits. Thank you guys for the extreme amount of money.

28
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:46,419
It's, I hope I use it well. I really do. I say that a lot, but I really mean it.

29
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:54,699
Is it going to play plumbers without ties? I don't know. Maybe, maybe I'll have like a porn day.

30
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:01,699
I'm not, that's no, we're not going to do a porn day, but you know what I mean? We'll do like a

31
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:14,939
porn day. Hey, 3DO week, PS1 week. Oh, PS2 classics. My favorite porn videos.

32
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:28,620
I don't think that would go over very well. Porn day. Yeah. All of my favorite,

33
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,960
it would only fit in one day, right guys? Who the fuck are we kidding? Don't even try to kid

34
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:44,539
yourself either. A porn day? No, take like three weeks. Oh, porn day. Sure. Nice lie.

35
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,759
I just punched the microphone accidentally too. All right. Are you ready to do this?

36
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,879
Are we ready to get another hundred community subs? This is ridiculous. There's no reason for

37
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:04,710
this. There's no reason for this. You guys are giving me too much money. A hundred more community

38
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:24,329
subs from PQR? That's another hundred. That's too many. That is 100 too many, but I will gladly

39
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:31,930
take it and say thank you. That's an extreme amount of money. You spent $500. Do that. That's

40
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:40,100
a lot of fucking money. Let's move over to the game because I am ready for it. There it is.

41
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:48,389
Jurassic Park Interactive. This is going to be just as fun as the ride that's at Universal Studios

42
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:55,879
and the ride is not very good. So hopefully this is okay. It's the same ride. I think I actually

43
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:02,019
think it's just the ride on a disc and I'm starting to realize that right now, but no way.

44
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,620
The back of the box does not show that at all. We're getting so many community subs. I can't

45
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:17,160
even keep up with them. This is fucking crazy. AGB Clown 10, Obstinarwhal 6, Technic Stars 5,

46
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:29,610
Philip Rivers 10, Crank Elm 5, Habbie 5, Little Hat 5, Ink Cat 5. This is too much money. You guys

47
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,250
are spoiling me. You don't need to do this. It's okay. I really appreciate it though. Thank you,

48
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:45,029
everybody. Jurassic Park Interactive. Here we go. Do I do normal, intermediate, or advanced?

49
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:55,019
It's not going to be advanced. It's going to be A or B. It's just going to be A, right?

50
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:09,579
I can't do advanced. I'll do B. B sounds fine. You ready? Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait till

51
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:16,439
Jon Hamm shows up and tells me about what we have to do. What's his name? Hammond, Hammond,

52
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:32,389
Hammond, Hammond. That's his name, right? What do we do? Okay. Security systems, animal systems,

53
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:39,980
engineering, security systems, security systems. That's Jon Hamm. Select tracking location.

54
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:51,620
Who is this? Dr. Ellie Sattler, Dr. Alan Grant, Robert Muldoon. Oh shit. These are

55
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:59,339
breakfast cereal actors for the actual actors, aren't they? Oh no. Dr. Ian Malcolm. Select

56
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:06,810
destination. Oh shit. Okay. Is that supposed to be me? All right. We're going to go to the

57
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:30,410
Brachiosaurus pen. What? What was that? Malcolm is surrounded by spitters. Help him out of the

58
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:44,490
jungle. You have a taser weapon. Charge it wisely. It has... What the fuck? How do I move? Oh shit.

59
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:55,610
All right. I got to charge this up and shoot it. Why did he run in here? What was the point?

60
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:13,990
My health. I think I'm going to die. There was some team rockets right there. Okay.

61
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:35,990
No. The screen's going black. I'm dead. Sorry. You did not make it. There may be more stranded

62
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:44,899
guests and staff. Check your computer. What is Malcolm dead? All right. What about... Hold on.

63
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:51,899
Animal systems. Animal systems. Select tracking location. Holy shit. This is a large game.

64
00:08:52,539 --> 00:09:01,509
Okay. Wait. We're going to find my favorite dinosaur. That could be me in the costume.

65
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:11,980
We have to see. All right. Velociraptor. Let's go. Animal tracking. All right. So the

66
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:19,769
Velociraptor is here. Okay. So let's go to security systems. Security systems. Select

67
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:25,769
tracking location. Here we go. Okay. Tim and Lex. Don't put the kids in with the Velociraptor.

68
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:36,710
Select destination. A Raptor pen? Displaying video. Why am I putting kids in a... Am I playing

69
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:47,139
roller coaster tycoon or like planet zoo? What am I doing? I don't get it. Lex and Tim are trapped

70
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:51,620
in a park building. Help them find their way out. You will need to find the keys to get through the

71
00:09:51,620 --> 00:10:01,379
locked doors. Raptors are here. Is this an FPS now? Are the kids with me? Okay. This is actually kind

72
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:25,909
of fucking scary. Do I have a punch? Okay. But what am I supposed to do? Is he chasing me?

73
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:33,610
He's not very fast. Okay. So let's just keep going. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. There's only

74
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:44,740
one, right? What happens if he touches you? Do you get killed? Lock five. Lock six. I have one key.

75
00:10:45,379 --> 00:11:02,779
Oh shit. There's the... I got to make this a little suspenseful. Does he not care anymore? Oh,

76
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:16,950
fuck it. Didn't work. I couldn't open the door. Okay. That's really, that's clearly a guy in a

77
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:23,769
mask. That's great. That was just a guy in a mask. That was a guy in a mask from like Spirit of

78
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:29,850
Halloween. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sensor registers no life signs.

79
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,820
Oh, there he is. Jon Hamm. Select destination. Jon Hamm. Let's go to... Let's go to your house

80
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:51,399
and just hang out. Displaying video. Camera malfunction. Uh-oh. Hammond is trapped in a

81
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,559
park building. Help him find his way out. You need to find the keys. Oh, give me a break.

82
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:01,100
You will need to find the keys to get through. All right. They all locked in these weird, like,

83
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:11,000
hostile dungeons. But where do I find the keys? I don't want to do this. Is it... Wait. I hope to

84
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,149
God it's not a raptor. I hope it's another bitmap image of another dinosaur. It's better not be

85
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:29,059
a velociraptor. All right. Hold on. Oh shit. There we go. Maintenance area. The fuck just happened?

86
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:41,509
What? You open the... I have to close the door? Everyone's gonna die. Literally no one's gonna

87
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:48,169
make it out alive. No one's gonna make it out. Shit. The ride is more fun than this. Oh no.

88
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:54,889
What have I done? The ride is way more fun. All right. Engineering. Engineering systems.

89
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:00,360
Engineering systems locked out. What do you mean locked out? What are you talking about? Security.

90
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:10,740
Level one security. Access permitted. Okay. What does that get me? It's a music player?

91
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,950
Okay. You must score 20,000 points to enter the next security level.

92
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:31,879
That's not even a spitter. That's a gremlin. This... Am I hacking the game? What's supposed

93
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:42,409
to be hacking the computer? Like Newman does, right? I'll be... I'm gonna... Actually, I'll be...

94
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:48,649
What do I need? 10,000? 20,000 points? I'll get it. This is the shit that the guy at the security

95
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:54,409
system is doing. No. This is not unlocking security shit. This is what the security guard is doing.

96
00:13:54,409 --> 00:14:14,870
He's on miniclip.com all day. All right. 10,000? What is it? 20,000? Who's the guy? Is that

97
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,220
supposed to be Newman? That's supposed to be Newman, right? Whatever his name is in the

98
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:31,379
universal dress park. What is it? I really hope security clearance two is not this again,

99
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:44,940
but with other pictures. He's the best security in the world. Could be better. Okay. 20,000 is

100
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,379
coming. You can still shoot when you're dead, by the way. Now, that's the real glitch way to win.

101
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:59,340
20,000. Okay. So, should I just die? Just let the things kill me because I get to 20,000?

102
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:14,299
What the... All right. Just kill me. I got to 20,000. It's 30,000? It's 30,000 points? Oh,

103
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:18,139
my God. Thank God. No, no, no. I can't die here. Okay. Actually, I'm going to stick the fuck up

104
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:30,779
and play well. I don't want to die. I'll get it here, right? I'll get it right here.

105
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:43,879
I did it. Level two. Level two security. Access permitted. Yeah, I got level two access.

106
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,789
You unlocked Winnie the Pooh Baseball. Oh, it actually is Winnie the Pooh. It's just

107
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:56,860
Flashgate. Okay. All right. 20,000. You know, I'm going to do it because why not?

108
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:09,100
Gallagher. It's actually kind of fun, though. All right. I'm curious. I want to sit here for a

109
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:31,379
little bit. Chex quest? It's hard to dodge that. The screen's tiny. Please stop. No, not yet. I

110
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,220
have to get to level... I got to get security clearance level five. And then after security

111
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:43,639
clearance level five, I'll open John Hamm's door. I'll at least save... I got to save one person.

112
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:53,850
Okay. The back of the CD has like you riding in a car and the T-Rex chasing you. Spoilers,

113
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,929
but this franchise is like 25 years old at this point. How do I do that?

114
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:05,740
Did it. Okay. All right. Move up to level three. Why is he a pirate now?

115
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:15,859
Level three security. Access permitted. What am I doing this for? I don't know what I'm doing it

116
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:31,589
for. I'm playing Ong versus a dinosaur. I don't want to do this one. I like don't actually want

117
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:45,819
to play this one. Wait, why is it just turning into the guy from dinosaurs, the TV show? Remember

118
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:55,829
that show? It was like the Muppets. They were the big puppet dinosaur things. Didn't that show end

119
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:01,190
really horribly, too? Like a fucking meteor hit the earth or something at the end of the last

120
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:09,079
episode? Something horrible, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, something horrible did happen.

121
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:27,900
That's really fucked up. I still love the baby. The baby was the best. By the way, every single

122
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,259
family oriented cartoon with a family of people was all based on dinosaurs. Family guy,

123
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,619
Simpsons. They all came after dinosaurs. The big fat, the big fat dad who's kind of dumb,

124
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:47,140
but he means well. The baby, that kid has magical powers and is funny and is sinister.

125
00:18:49,029 --> 00:19:02,440
Simpsons fucking copy dinosaurs. I just lose. I got 20,000 Flintstones. Oh, they got inspiration

126
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:21,859
from the Flintstones, not the other way around. It's a woke take. I don't want to play anymore.

127
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:33,829
Just let me just get the security level five. I'm trying to lose. Hold on. This is even the

128
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:41,529
dinosaurs theme song. This is the shit that plays when the big dinosaur guy is driving his car to

129
00:19:41,529 --> 00:20:00,019
work. Okay. Security level five. I'm going to do this. Level four security access permitted.

130
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:06,539
Do the baby impression. And the baby kind of loved me. Then I do a poop in my pants.

131
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,859
Something like that, right? You might actually think I'm making that part up. He actually says

132
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:26,490
that part. He actually says what I just said. I didn't read this. Oh shit. Yeah. Let's respect

133
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:51,099
nature and the dinosaurs. Arm the laser cannon and shoot them. All right. What is the 20,000?

134
00:20:53,299 --> 00:21:10,500
Spawn cam, spawn cam, spawn cam. Fix it. Fucking Activision. Fucking idiots. Did I do my good,

135
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:20,230
like fake, like pissed off thing? You guys like that? Did you like it? Why move? I got this all

136
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:32,339
wrong. Why move at all? I think they just keep spawning. Yeah. This sort of reminds me of what

137
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:40,140
a really over enthusiastic history teacher would do. Like a science teacher. This is like an

138
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,460
over enthusiastic science teacher's little side project that the kids get to play for like 15

139
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:53,579
minutes at the end of class. And although you don't think it's very fun, you don't have to

140
00:21:53,579 --> 00:22:16,359
listen to him talk. So this is the alternative and it's better. This game probably took dozens

141
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:23,269
of people to make. Yeah. The 3DO is awesome. I love this thing. I'm going to wrap this thing

142
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:28,329
up. I'm going to laminate my 3DO and I'm never touching it ever again after this.

143
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:44,490
3DO sucks. No, it doesn't. 3DO is pretty fun. They made this in Microsoft Publisher.

144
00:22:47,910 --> 00:23:03,690
It's probably made in Adobe director or something. I have to die now. All right. It's fun. What do

145
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:11,029
you get for doing this though? That's why I have to do this. Does he know the 3DO sucks? It doesn't

146
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:18,039
though. This is fun. Interactive media. All right. Level five. This is it. Security clearance level

147
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:30,859
five. Level five security access permitted. What's the number five? Okay. This is wrap attack.

148
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:46,180
Oh no. No. The science teacher roped in the math teacher to make their own and showed him how easy

149
00:23:46,180 --> 00:24:04,539
it was. How are we going to play the same game next period? 20,000. And then what? It's just

150
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:13,400
asteroid. What? Horrible. You can die by the fan. What's with the environmental damage? It's not

151
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:23,269
cool. NA classes. Don't you guys know what NA classes were? Wheel the TV in, play a movie,

152
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,269
or look at this cool shitty thing that one of the teachers made and we're all going to exploit for

153
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:33,430
the next six weeks? Or get everybody into the gym to sit there and here's an assembly for two hours.

154
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:46,839
I don't think we learned anything. I don't think I learned anything. No, no, no. You know, you know,

155
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,839
I learned how to go to the bathroom really fucking fast because apparently if you took more than one

156
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,480
minute to go to the bathroom, you were like a terrible student. That's what I learned in an

157
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,910
NA education. Can I go to the bathroom? Yes, you can. But hurry the fuck up. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'll

158
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:07,769
pee pee and it hurts. It hurts. I'm peeing as hard as I can. It hurts. Get out of the bathroom. Oh,

159
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,890
what are you doing in the hall? I decided to go to the bathroom. Yeah. Prove it. Okay. I'm going

160
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:26,859
to go back to class. Get back there. That's what I learned. And then all of a sudden one of the

161
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:34,549
exits would open. It's like one of the bad kids. Hey, man, you want to skip class and go to X-Men?

162
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:56,329
No, no, I'm okay. Yeah, I do. But no. Did I get level two? This is sick. You are a loser.

163
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:10,900
Just shut up. There was always that group that like, and guess what? There were people that I knew

164
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,859
that weren't like friends with them necessarily, but like you knew some of these people that were

165
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:19,940
in like your class or something. They'd walk into class and they would just smell like the bottom

166
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,380
of a bowl. You know what I mean? Just like, oh, yeah, you must have, okay. All right. That's

167
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:36,950
what you were just doing somewhere, I guess. That is a marijuana reference. It's just like,

168
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:44,890
oh, yeah. All right. Well, hey, what do you think? Good? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm good. Cool.

169
00:26:46,250 --> 00:27:00,940
CVD. This actually can't be what NA education is. No, that wasn't the teacher. That was not the

170
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:09,339
teacher. The teacher sits down and it smells like weed. Hey, how you doing, kids? Hey, hey,

171
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:18,859
you want to go see, hey, fuck this class. You all want to go see X-Men? Who wants to go, hey,

172
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:25,750
who wants to go see X-Men? Why does everybody have to turn into Mr. Satan? All right. You do,

173
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,529
all right. You do know what to do next, do you? No, I don't. Access permitted to all. Oh shit. I

174
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:42,920
was supposed to do that. Rebooting systems. What? Alert. I was supposed to do that. That was return

175
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:54,380
to priority one command. Return to Isla Nublar priority one command. Will comply. ETA 16 hours.

176
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,849
Two crewmen lost. And two kids, right? Two kids as well. I know you don't want to take the blame

177
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:08,039
for that. But that's what happened. Two kids are dead too. Okay. Is that what I need to do?

178
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,150
Level five security access permitted. Wait, we just go right to level five security clearance?

179
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:22,410
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

180
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:39,210
just crash into stuff. How am I still alive? So many community subs are coming. Oh my fucking God.

181
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,299
I can't even read all these. There's so many. Destroy dude five.

182
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:53,220
Chungi five. Jerma sucks five. Tiger fam five. No flaw. That's a zero on there. I didn't see the

184
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,859
600 subs over the last 15 minutes. Thank you tiger fan for the 50. That's insane.

185
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:15,720
Add Dan. Thanks to the five and Coilia is gamer. Thanks to eight. Please just let me die.

186
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:26,259
Why can I not crash? Will we ever make him cry again? I don't have a reason to cry right now.

187
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:33,190
Okay. Get me out of here. Now, what does that, like, what does that do for me? All right. There's

198
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:25,700
Okay. Did I crash? It did great. Go through the windshield or did the T-Rex eat us? I don't know.

199
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:44,170
Okay. He's dead. Those kids are dead. John Hammond is dead. What about the weird guy?

202
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:13,109

203
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:47,430
not to have him in my house. You have a taser. Oh my God. Not this shit again. No. How am I

204
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:54,890

205
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:08,650
and dying because I can't save them. Guess when? I can't. Is there anybody left on the island?

206
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:18,099
Should I just leave? This was just a really complicated VR. Okay. Robert Muldoon. This is

215
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:38,489

216
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:56,099
he'll get killed. He's not going to be right here, is he? Oh shit. It's just a big, drop it, drop it,

217

219
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:22,949
around. Oh, clever girl. They're all dead. Whatever. I'm going, I want to go to the T-Rex pen and just

222
00:35:45,579 --> 00:36:02,679

223
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:12,389
a lot of people leaving. How much footage of people like running away from the house do you have

224
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:22,630
here? Already? Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Drive. I have the fucking dinosaur bones in the middle

226
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:59,219
I have to save one person. I have to save Dr. Ellie. Come on. This is my favorite character.

227
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:05,559
When she puts her hand on the Triceratops's belly and says goodbye. Oh, that was such a touching

228
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:14,039
moment for us all. What? This is impossible. It's not possible to drive. It's impossible.

229
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:26,809
It's not possible. It's impossible. I should have done normal. Okay. Dude, you didn't do very well

230
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:38,460
saving people. You did notify the cargo ship in time. Rating Brachius. How did I notify the

231
00:37:38,460 --> 00:38:03,590
cargo ship? Is that the computer hacking? What's going on? Why did he move? His face just moved.

232
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:18,039
His face just moved. Okay. Well, that was Jurassic Park Interactive. It was the science teacher.

233
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:33,960
There he was. Okay. Let's move on. Let me just make, let me just take this out. I liked that one.

234
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:44,619
It was terrible, but I loved it. Did I miss anything in it? Oh, we saw it all. We saw it all.

235
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:50,300
Nothing else to say really. Well, you can, while I get the next CD, you can watch the intro video.

236
00:38:50,300 --> 00:39:08,070
It's pretty cool. Hey, Kalissa. Coming up next, we have something that I just want to get out of the

237
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:13,590
way because I know that it is going to be, it's not going to be very good, but it doesn't matter.

238
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:25,179
Next one is called Club 3DO Station Invasion On The Air. This is a, this is like Nickelodeon

239
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:36,739
Magazine, the CD. That's how I can describe it, the way it looks. Wait, is this just the actual

240
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:47,460
intro to Jurassic Park? I didn't even watch this. Oh yeah. No, no, I know what this is. Yeah.

241
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,699
This is torrent underscore zero four four two point one zero underscore torrent Jurassic Park

242
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:02,860
full movie underscore one one one one underscore two. Jurassic Park, located on an island off the

243
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,550
coast of Costa Rica, was conceived and built by John Hammond. Hammond, an extremely wealthy

244
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:14,389
dinosaur fanatic and his company InGen Corporation, leased the island of Isla Nublar from the

245
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:19,670
government. Okay, you already know the story. Let's play Station Invasion Club 3DO. You're going to

246
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:25,940
get bars across your screen. Just want to make sure you wear that 3DO just through the way that's

247
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:36,820
getting captured. It's going to be like incoming in about three seconds. Three, two, maybe not.

248
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:43,780
Just do it. Anyway, I did air. All right, coming up here comes Station Invasion Club 3DO.

249
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:51,289
No idea. I don't even know why I got this. In the inside cover, there's a dog with a suit on.

250
00:40:51,849 --> 00:41:06,550
So, I got high hopes. Show dog. I will. Hold on. Let me just get it in. God, I love this 3DO.

251
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:31,420
Let's go. Show auto. No, not right now. He's sleeping behind me. This one's kind of...

252
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:40,519
Can you hear that disc chugger? It's going... It's like a PlayStation 3. I almost said 2.

253
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:59,739
All right, Club 3DO Station Invasion. Awesome start. Here's at the TV station. Kids.

254
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:36,409
Oh, it must have been really fucking failing. It must have been free.

255
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:57,190
I know my ratings haven't been that great, Mary Lee, but the babes still dig me, huh?

256
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,679
He's not talking about... Who is that young man over there?

257
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:04,840
Wait, what? That's Jake Smits, the...

258
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,559
Look at that shoe in there. That is an elaborate fucking shoe.

259
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:14,900
Obnoxious little bugger, isn't he? Wait, Mary, don't you want to ask me some more questions?

260
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:21,320
Let's do lunch sometime. Okay, now get rid of that guy. No, get rid of that guy.

261
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:32,219
Why not? So you're the new president? That I... Do you have any... No, we're going to hire some

262
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,699
new blood in here. We're going to take the top five shows and put the top producer on each one.

263
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:38,940
Am I going to be a producer? These kids will be the best.

264
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:45,219
But I'm not a kid. I mean, who knows TV better than us kids?

265
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:51,210
That's a good point. How about some new recruits coming in today that look real promising?

266
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,010
Me. Well, we wish you the best of luck, Jake.

267
00:43:54,010 --> 00:44:00,570
Thanks, Mary. Maybe we can do lunch sometime? Yeah, that makes more sense.

268
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:09,780
Why are they all the same dialogue, though? Why does everything have to end in

269
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,780
let's do lunch sometime? It's just the writer just didn't care. I always had to end a sentence.

270
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,940
Even if it was like a 40-year-old talking to an 11-year-old.

271
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,579
Like, I just looked at lunch sometime. I don't know how to end sentences.

272
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,860
I love this board. This is awesome.

273
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,320
It's got a baseball bat, too.

274
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,880
Abuse adults? Like, just like let's torture adults? The network?

275
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,519
Hi, I'm Billy Sparks, the star of the sitcom, I'm Grounded. I play a guy,

276
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,719
also named Billy Sparks, coincidentally, who's always either grounded or getting grounded,

277
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:13,000
with the good help of my friend, Igor. I get into a lot of trouble, but it's not my fault.

278
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,960
I'm just misunderstood. I'm Bryce Banyan, host of the show,

279
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,440
Mystery Smistries. We answer all life's burning questions. What happened to the missing sock?

280
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,559
Why is there always one shoe lying at the side of the road? I don't think of Mystery Smistries as a

281
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:34,119
show, as much as I think of it as a journey. Okay.

282
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:41,880
Do we get to do all these things? Do we have to like play these mini-games or something,

283
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,840
or do these shows?

284
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,019
Okay.

285
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,659
And my new best friend. Okay, this is important. This is the biggest decision of the whole day,

286
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:19,340
but I gotta pick my show and my new best friend.

287
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,820
I think, yeah, Mystery Smistries.

288
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:30,519
Too desperate. Way too desperate.

289
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,920
There's only one show for you, and that's Sundays of Our Lives.

290
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,920
I'm not a big fan of like Sundays, really.

291
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,599
Right, okay, yeah, that's to the point and incredibly accurate.

292
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:45,400
I like having fun.

293
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,880
I mean, he's like, okay.

294
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,920
No, I don't. I don't.

295
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:03,159
No, I don't. I don't.

296
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:04,199
I don't.

297
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:04,679
Mystery.

298
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,539
Oh, okay, my name is B.

299
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:21,460
Up to 10 letters? How much is E?

300
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:37,739
This is like freaking me out. I thought that was a Y. All right, let's go. Like difficulty.

301
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:56,650
Easy. Or not easy. Easy. This is a game for children, right? This is a game for kids.

302
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:05,219
How about hard? This is a good beat. I like this track. I'm gonna pick it by the music.

303
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:22,329
What is it? Let's go here. I'm ready to produce my TV show.

304
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:30,170
It's up to you. Press A for complete game. Press B for fast game or press C.

305
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,369
Listen, what is a complete game?

306
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:39,210
First week of Kid TV begins. There's a dog with a tie on.

307
00:48:41,429 --> 00:48:48,219
Mystery Smystery is produced by Jeremy.

308
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:52,539
We need a lot of tomato juice for tomorrow's episode on why tomato juice is used to get rid

309
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:56,699
of the smell of skunk. We need to figure out how much we need and how much it will cost.

310
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:59,659
There's a lot more to do before tomorrow. I didn't pick the smell TV one. I'm actually

311
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:02,860
a little irritated about this Mr. Mystery Smystery. I thought we're going to be solving mysteries,

312
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,260
not smelly puke stuff. Use the joy pad to choose a number block and the A button to rotate it.

313
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,659
Solve all three problems and press C when done.

314
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:15,019
Oh, shit. Wait, is math wrong? Two, seven, uh.

315
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:28,010
Twelve, six divided by. Where's the three? No, where's the?

316
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:41,849
I didn't lose yet. I need a four. Six, four divided by one divided by four is four. Where's the one?

317
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:47,449
Sixteen, four, eight, twelve, sixteen, four, eight, twelve, six. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

318
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:54,329
Eight, eight, twelve, six, twelve. I don't know. Six, seven divided by two, four, six,

319
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:56,489
eight, ten, twelve. Okay, now we got thirty-two, thirty-nine.

320
00:49:58,409 --> 00:50:02,010
Twelve divided by. No, what is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it?

321
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,690
What is it? What is it? What is it? Twelve? No, no, it's like eight. It's like three. What is it?

322
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:21,690
What is it? It's three. Yeah, he's smart as hell. Jeremy gained six points. That would be the

323
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:28,360
Ukulaka tribal victory dance. Feel free to join in at any time. How is this a mystery?

324
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:34,280
This is doing shitty math problems. It sure was an exciting week for television, don't you think?

325
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,550
Look at the ratings for the week. Come on, you got to put two human hands up like, like Swedish

326
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:54,840
chef style. This is just a, this is Mario Party, but it, this is the twisted game, but with kids.

327
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,909
Let's look at a clip from one of this week's top shows. All right, here we go.

328
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:12,730
People pick their noses when they get in their car. It's not like we can't see them. Why do they

329
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:24,150
do it? What luck. We just caught Dak Jones. Not if you have tinted windows. I wasn't picking.

330
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:34,840
I had an itch. Isn't a guy allowed to scratch an itch anymore? What's this guy doing over here,

331
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:41,159
by the way? I did it. Is that what you want to hear? Yep. I don't think it's that gross.

332
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,480
Well, we brought a gross meter with us, Dak. Gross meter. Let's just see how your pick score.

333
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,440
It's a two out of 10. Those meters don't prove anything. No, they don't. They aren't even accepted

334
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,360
in a court of law. That's bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, no. I disagree. Disagree. That's a one or

335
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:02,019
a two out of 10. I hate you. Now if he ate it, it would have been an eight. He didn't though.

336
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:20,059
What is that guy? That guy in the background at the newspaper stand is scaring me. He's freaking

337
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:30,010
me out. Where are the cue cards? They're all gone. I never remember my lines. You have to help me.

338
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:33,130
I know you're not a script writer, but you're going to have to be for today.

339
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:39,099
And what does that entail? Let's see. Select each word requested by using the joy pad and the A

340
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:47,639
button. These mad libs? I'm pretty good at these. All right. Pick a verb. Verb. Okay. Creepy. Pizza.

341
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:55,880
A verb. Smuggles. Scatters. Cleans. Syrupy. Hot. Hot can be a verb, right? How about cleans?

342
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:06,440
Clean is a verb. You're cleaning something. Clean. Pick an adjective. Adjective. Stale.

343
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:21,980
Pick a verb. Verb. I have one second left. Wow. That wasn't very good, was it?

344
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:28,820
I didn't realize there was a timer. Agree, John. This week was fabulous. Look at the ratings.

345
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:38,090
You're not even going to bark? You lost it. I thought it was mad libs. I didn't think it was

346
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:54,789
actually get it correct. Couldn't agree more. Better be mine. No. I don't want to watch this shit.

347
00:53:54,789 --> 00:54:18,460
Do you think it's interesting that in the kids TV where they want to get rid of all the adults,

348
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:38,199
all the kids just pretend to be adults? It's weird, right? That kid had mustache hair? Yeah,

349
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:46,250
good. Mustache hair is going to become a big trend sooner or later and then everyone's going

350
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:54,420
to look back and be like, wow, I know where that started. This guy. All right. Now I understand.

351
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:02,280
It's vocabulary. The art director quit. She just quit. She says she's not appreciated.

352
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,360
I'll go have a talk with her. In the meantime, you have to take over. I don't know anything

353
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:12,280
about art. Do the best. Neither do I. You're asking the wrong person. All right. Select two

354
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,880
pieces to exchange using the joy pad and the A button. Press the C button when done. What do

355
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:24,789
you mean? George Frederick Handel, water music. Oh, okay. It's one of these.

356
00:55:28,469 --> 00:55:31,670
George Frederick Michelson, waterbender.

357
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:55,219
Get this big ass hair. I don't. George Frederick Handel's water music was performed on a boat for

358
00:55:55,219 --> 00:56:02,250
King George, the first of England. Nice. We're going to get our show on TV today. What can I

359
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:20,139
say? You're the best. Thanks, man. Yes. And it was the same clip twice in a row. That's how you can

360
00:56:20,139 --> 00:56:41,369
tell it was even better. All right. Let's get, let's see what we got on TV. I thought that was

361
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:56,010
funny. You did too. I don't care if it's 11 year olds that I laughed at it. I don't care. Hey,

362
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,690
how many of you guys used to have contests? So who could throw that fucking exact football

363
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:09,719
as far as possible? It didn't even play catch. Wow. That's great. Hey, you want to come up?

364
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:14,599
There's a ladder over there. It's just a bunch of fucking eighth graders blow out their arms,

365
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:19,960
trying to one up each other. Betty Primrose. Just what do you think you're doing on that ladder?

366
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:28,980
What? Hi, Mr. Sparks. Guess what? This is the angry dad. A thousand times and never gets caught.

367
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:37,820
Betty has to come over once. Wait. Once. That's the thing that was happening in Jurassic Park.

368
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:57,429
A dog. I love that dog. Okay. Fourth week of kid TV season. When do we get canceled?

369
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:12,230
On week five. There's some problems that need to be solved. Get to work.

370
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:18,650
Okay. What problems? Match an animal with its proper classification by using the joy pad and

371
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:22,809
the apron. Oh dear. This is not going to go well. Choose a mammal. Mammal. Okay. Mammal is,

372
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:30,650
that's an elephant. Choose an insect. That is a fly. Choose a fish. That is a goldfish.

373
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:36,630
Choose an amphibian. That would be a frog. Choose a bird. A bird. That would be a chicken.

374
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:48,280
Choose a reptile. Reptile. That would be a turtle. That was easy. That was a very respectable

375
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:55,860
performance. Why was I talking as? Why was I talking like that was impressive?

376
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,920
Billy Madison. I'm like sitting in a third grade class as a 35 year old.

377
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,219
That's a turtle. I win. I'm smarter than all these children.

378
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:23,340
Like Jeremy, we don't win in class. Oh wow. You sure? I do. As usual,

379
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:35,610
we follow the ratings chart with a clip. Smarter than a fifth grader.

380
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:42,250
Do a Jerma Madison stream. That would take a lot of convincing. Do you understand?

381
00:59:53,190 --> 01:00:08,869
What's he holding? What the hell is this thing? This is not a real thing, right? Isn't this the

382
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:19,980
thing you skipped over? What is this supposed to do? What is that supposed to be doing?

383
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:40,840
One by by. We take cash. If it gets lost in the mail, it's not our fault. What the hell was that?

384
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:49,820
Did you put a thing around your waist? What was that thing called? Skip it. Skip it. What's the

385
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,860
song called? The thing that used to trip a bunch of kids. What was that thing called?

386
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:01,559
We need a lot of tomato juice for tomorrow's episode on why tomato juice is used to get

387
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:05,400
rid of the smell of skunk. We need to figure out how much we need and how much it will cost.

388
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,960
Yeah, how many of you guys used to cheat with the skip it? You just put the hoop under one

389
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,159
of your ankles and you spun it as fast as you possibly could to try to get like a thousand

390
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:23,059
points by cheating. Oh shit, I went and said, what does three point 45 minus four, I don't know.

391
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:27,139
I don't know. The cashier does this for me. I don't do this. They just tell me a number.

392
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:34,780
Uh, one, one 20, just three point two, four plus four point two, five plus one.

393
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:43,960
That's that would be four, five, six, six, uh, 24, six, seven, uh, seven, six, five.

394
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:52,760
What's this three? That's four, three, two, four, six, three, three, six, three, 75.

395
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:02,469
Some mysteries are tougher than others. You know that that was a tough one.

396
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:06,280
Wasn't even tough. The cashier does that for you. None of you guys could just do that right now.

397
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:16,300
Sean, you're just cool. Is there a new gal in your ratings?

398
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:27,449
What was that? What is that? That was a big cat puke. Stop pretending. I'm not. I'm just

399
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:35,030
hanging out, man. That was a dog puke. Let me roll a slip from one of those shows.

400
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:49,530
Oh, that smell. Smell. Shitty TV show. Remember folks, Mr. Slugs is doing this in one whiff.

401
01:02:50,360 --> 01:03:04,780
You'll never get this one. I'm the champ. I'll get it. What is that stuff? That's disgusting.

402
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:10,780
Want one more whiff? It's a fucking. I'm not going near that jar again.

403
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:17,260
Mr. Jones, it's your. And she stole a gangrene in his toe.

404
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,820
That means he was decomposing right on the person's body.

405
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:25,539
They had to amputate this guy's toe and my sister stole it.

406
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
There's a lot of wrong with what he was talking about.

407
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,239
That was super. And John, I'm going to get you to talk about your.

408
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,400
Way too many things wrong with that. Okay, so you stole somebody's toe from a hospital.

409
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:44,489
Okay, that's felony one. Then you put it into a jar. That's serial killer one.

410
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:51,750
And then you made somebody smell it. That's both felony and serial killer combined at

411
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:57,429
the same time. So every felony to serial killer to see if cows get lonely when they get lost from

412
01:03:57,429 --> 01:04:03,099
the herd. Isn't that ridiculous or waste of money? Of course they do. Who wouldn't?

413
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:06,780
Anyway, we want to conduct our own tests, so we need to fly all around the country.

414
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:11,179
We'll need maps, information about different cities, states and a bunch of other junk.

415
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:13,980
Now that's where you come in. Information is your middle name.

416
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:19,820
I don't know these. I don't. Nobody does. People that pretend to be or see button to

417
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,900
all right. I know where every major city is in the entire state of Delaware.

418
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,179
I don't fucking have any idea which of the above states was the first to

419
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:29,500
ratify the United States Constitution. I don't know if Delaware.

420
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,420
Now that was a mystery to be said. I said to get that right.

421
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:45,670
I'm proud. Jeremy, you really don't know what the third capital of Delaware is.

422
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:57,429
Didn't like it. He really didn't like it. He hated it. He doesn't like this week at all.

423
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:23,369
Just me slapping myself missing socks. For years, people had their theories.

424
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:26,329
Perhaps they were stuck to the wall of the washing machine or dryer.

425
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:31,130
Maybe you dropped one on your way to the laundromat. Or maybe there's a little man

426
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:34,650
or woman possibly related to whoever turns the light off in the refrigerator when you

427
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:40,409
close the door. And maybe that person likes to mess with our minds. They're taking socks

428
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:45,610
one at a time just to screw us up. Or maybe we're not losing socks at all.

429
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:52,809
Maybe we're gaining new socks one at a time. That's some 500 IQ shit right there.

430
01:05:54,170 --> 01:06:08,869
Maybe we're just gaining them one at a time. I don't know why I just thought that headline

431
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:12,710
was going to say that they were fired for something like a scandal of kid TV.

432
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:18,469
Person that put severed toe in jar somehow turned out to be a fucking criminal.

433
01:06:18,469 --> 01:06:28,780
How much water do we need? Why so much grape juice? These are bonafide mysteries, my friend.

434
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:33,480
I've said it a million times and I'll say it again. Research is everything on this show.

435
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:41,460
Let's go do some. I'm ready. Use the joy pad and the A button to select letters and

436
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:46,340
unscramble the correct answer. Press B to erase and C when done.

437
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:51,860
Unscramble a word. What is the angular distance measured in degrees east or west of the prime

438
01:06:51,860 --> 01:07:01,380
meridian called the equator? The angular distance measured in degrees east of or west.

439
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:24,420
Long deep to it. Longitude. It's not longitude. It's longitude. I thought it was longitude.

440
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,820
All the mysteries. Now, you know, I thought it was longitude, longitude,

441
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:35,880
not longitude. I thought it was longitude. Longitude, not longitude.

442
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:49,059
Like a long L O N G D I T U D E longitude, longitude. I'm still in first place.

443
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:07,860
That's not pretending. I promise. I think I'm pretending. I thought it was longitude.

444
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:19,880
Parsley flavors. Sure. Whatever. You're a snake.

445
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:25,159
Whatever do you mean? Betsy Skinner said she saw you and Nick at the movies last night.

446
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:30,279
Your anger seems a little misdirected, Parsley. Perhaps it's yourself you should be scolding for

447
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:36,760
not keeping him on a better leash. Just watch your back, Angelica Dujour. When you least expect it,

448
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:41,800
I'm gonna- You'll do nothing. You are but a small speck of dandruff on my shoulder that I just flick-

449
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,479
Oh, you have dandruff? Disgusting. I'm gonna spread that around the class as a rumor now.

450
01:08:46,359 --> 01:09:14,470
Oh, no, don't. I'm kidding. So there. Terrific. Somebody needs to prove the press releases that

451
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:18,390
are going out. The press release gives the critics updated information about our show.

452
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:21,350
Could you look them over and fix any words that don't belong?

453
01:09:23,109 --> 01:09:29,189
No, kid. All of the words on the screen are the same part of speech.

454
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:32,470
Choose the word on the next screen that is that same part of speech.

455
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:36,789
Roll nouns, okay? All right, so I found a noun. Compute planet.

456
01:09:46,300 --> 01:10:02,100
Come on, kid. Learn from the best. Is this guy still picking his nose?

457
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:16,229
Is he still the nose picker? I miss the Star Wars game. We'll see it again.

458
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:27,369
It's been an hour? Yeah, I'm still interested. I gotta get to the end.

459
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:41,670
Meet people. This is every show on Nickelodeon now.

460
01:10:55,430 --> 01:11:00,390
Hey there. I was driving by and I couldn't help but notice your fabulous voice. Have you ever

461
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:06,550
thought about playing Vegas? I'm a big agent. No, no, don't lump this guy in with Vegas.

462
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,659
You could be the next Inklebert Humperdink. Better yet, the next Elvis.

463
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,819
We could leave right now. What do you say? Really shitty security system around this place,

464
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:31,220
by the way. There's a laugh track. There's a laugh track on this. This is horrible. This is

465
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:38,810
like terrifying. Hey mom, can I go with a stranger? He's not going to take me in his car. Why are they

466
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:54,569
laughing at this? This is fucking horrendous. In our show, the music is really important.

467
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:59,640
It creates a mood and an atmosphere that is essential. We need to find more music. We've

468
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:04,119
been using the same stuff for weeks. Would you mind going down to the music library and checking

469
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:11,210
it out? Thanks. All right, let's do some music. Use the joy pad and the A button to select the

470
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:17,829
three instruments playing the melody. Yeah, I can do this. That doesn't sound like any...

471
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:32,329
Hey, so this is not just me going like... That's an oboe? I don't know. I don't... That's a piano.

472
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:43,350
French horn. Almost. One time I got hit in the head with a baseball and my coach told

473
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:47,909
me to shake it off. I'm not quite sure what he meant, but I offer that advice to you.

474
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:53,060
Shake it off. You okay? When did this happen? Yesterday? Or like a couple of years ago?

475
01:12:55,060 --> 01:13:01,079
They work all hours of day and night. And let me tell you, their work is paying off. These shows

476
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:10,300
aren't great. Let's look at... I'm almost there. Week nine. Come on, get me to a hundred.

477
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:16,229
Fifty. It's gonna be fifty. What happened to the dog? I don't know. Yeah, where's the dog?

478
01:13:17,029 --> 01:13:39,850
Where's the dog? Where's the dog? Maybe another weird like fitness thing?

479
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:49,739
...by Jake Smith, president of the newly founded KidTV, which you're watching right now. He's also

480
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:56,460
my boss. Hi, Jake. Hi, Silva. Tell us, what made you decide to run a television station?

481
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,619
Well, a bunch of us kids decided we could do anything if we put our minds to it,

482
01:14:00,619 --> 01:14:05,579
so we started finding good clean ways of making money. We rode lawns, sold lemonade,

483
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:10,699
cookies... The intro again. Eventually, we raised enough money to do something

484
01:14:10,699 --> 01:14:14,859
real big. And we didn't like the old TV station that used to be here,

485
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:22,869
so we took it over and made it our own. I think we did a good job, don't you? Absolutely. I'm

486
01:14:22,869 --> 01:14:27,109
proud of the work we've done. Is there any message you would like to send out to kids with dreams of

487
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:32,069
grandeur? Yes. I'd like kids to remember they could do anything they want if they just put

488
01:14:32,069 --> 01:14:38,949
their minds to it. Anything. If you could dream about it, you could do it. Good segment. Good

489
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:53,140
segment, son. Superlative. Oh, thank God. There's John. He's fine. Sweep's week begins. What a sweep

490
01:14:53,140 --> 01:15:08,229
week. Uh-oh. Another adult got in. Uh-oh. Well, I had originally called you all here to tell you

491
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:13,109
about Sweep's week, but it seems I have some other unfortunate news to announce.

492
01:15:14,069 --> 01:15:19,829
Dac Jones apparently has broken in and vandalized the station. What? Stolen property from us

493
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:25,270
and generally wreaked havoc on Kid TV. So let's kick his ass. This is going to make your jobs a

494
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:30,069
lot tougher in the next week. Everything you do will be worth triple the regular rating.

495
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:36,310
And now you will have more problems to contend with. Thanks to Dac, it will be one challenge

496
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:44,420
after another game. What? There's a guy just like hiding in the halls and shit? They can't get rid

497
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:48,260
of this person. They can't get security or anything. I can't like, I don't understand. Why?

498
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:54,279
Press the A button to stop the lights and choose your three challenges.

499
01:15:54,279 --> 01:16:01,899
To use my three challenges. Oh shit. It's like whammies. Oh no. Take three, sound and rewrite.

500
01:16:01,899 --> 01:16:07,180
Solve the three problems by using the joy pad and the A button to select the correct damsel.

501
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:14,460
Okay, okay, okay. That's two, four, four, thirty, five, four, fifty, six, seventy, four, six, five,

502
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:22,039
no, four, seventy, one, two, two, thirty, sixty, two, sixty, three, sixty. Thank you. Two,

503
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:32,470
twenty-five, five, two, two, twenty-five, two, four, four, twenty-five. Hey, you tried. You'll

504
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:39,500
come back. Select each word requested by using the joy pad and the A button.

505
01:16:39,500 --> 01:17:21,140
Alright. Adjective. Is Sunny an adjective? Geek. What? Geek is an adjective. Goofy. Hachi? Adjective. Noun, noun, geek. Geek. He actually doesn't. No, I do know. Geek is a fucking adjective.

506
01:17:21,140 --> 01:18:10,529
Are you describing? Like, if you are a geek, isn't that like you're describing somebody as like a geek? I don't know what that is. I have no fucking idea. Bird? It's a piccolo. To put it in front of a noun, moron. Hey! Hey! Hey! Geek. If somebody's a geek, you're describing them as a geek. Uh oh. Is this the awards show? Is this the guy walking around the studio?

507
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:24,750
Geeky would be the adjective. Yeah. I know. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever.

508
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:42,949
I hate these award shows personally. I'm only here on behalf of my producer. I get the best in town and the least I can do is show up and get the award. So you're pretty sure you're gonna get one? I like to think positive. But if we can't, what do you do? Awards aren't everything, are they? Of course not.

509
01:18:42,949 --> 01:18:45,949
This kid just dresses himself. Like, look at those shoes.

510
01:18:53,949 --> 01:18:55,380
Okay.

511
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:03,380
Why am I not there?

512
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:11,739
Oh, it's the creep! Why does it fit him?

513
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:24,340
Little dachy boy when he steals your little trophy. Smelly kids.

514
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Hit him with the trophy!

515
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,500
Bite him!

516
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,500
Go bite him!

517
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,560
He got it! Nice job!

518
01:20:10,779 --> 01:20:12,779
The stage light falls and crushes his head.

519
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:17,239
That's a little too far, but you know what I mean.

520
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,180
We won!

521
01:20:31,229 --> 01:20:32,229
We did it! We won!

522
01:20:42,369 --> 01:20:51,250
That was great. Cool.

523
01:20:52,619 --> 01:21:03,810
What happened to the Vegas guy? He didn't show up and put on a weird overcoat? How did that guy steal that jacket? It was on the kid.

524
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:07,500
I have a lot of strange questions here.

525
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:13,699
He put the coat down next to him? How did he get it?

526
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:29,579
It's freaking me out. I pray we never see anything like this again.

527
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,520
I actually thoroughly enjoyed this one. I thought this was gonna be an immediate next.

528
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,760
I thought it was pretty good.

529
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:43,770
Okay, alright. Want to speed run one more? One more? Speed run it? Do like a fast run?

530
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:50,489
No! Okay!

531
01:21:51,489 --> 01:22:02,210
There was so many no's in less than a second that my chat froze for a second. That was fucking hilarious.

532
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,210
Alright, let's move on. I might come back to it though.

533
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:10,430
Wait, is there an after credit sequence?

534
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:24,939
Next up is going to be, probably, like I said, there was a couple, two or three here today that was the reason why I bought this.

535
01:22:25,939 --> 01:22:28,939
This is the one. Waited a little while to do it.

536
01:22:29,939 --> 01:22:35,380
About to play. Exclusive to the Family Feud. Fucking just, how did I, I just spoiled it.

537
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:40,380
Exclusive to the 3DO. Family Feud FMV.

538
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:46,069
I messed that up.

539
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:52,140
There's a full FMV Family Feud 3DO game. Exclusive to the 3DO.

540
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,149
I cannot fucking wait.

541
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:02,079
Why don't we take this opportunity to take a small break. Let's go pee.

542
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:06,140
I'll be back in about two minutes.

543
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:50,630
Back. Ready for Family Feud.

544
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:57,380
What are you guys saying? Cringe. Cringe. Cringe. What is this?

545
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:05,630
I'm so looking forward to this.

546
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,189
Give me the link. Quick.

547
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:10,430
Well, we do have a minute.

548
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:13,439
Before I press play, what is it?

549
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:28,579
Look, I cannot. Look, do you understand how much convincing it would take to let me be in a classroom and just disrupt the class?

550
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:34,800
I would need to hire a bunch of people. It would have to be, I couldn't do it for real.

551
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,090
It would be a total disruption.

552
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:49,149
Actual stream. You clearly want to do it.

553
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:51,149
Sure. I think that would be really fun.

554
01:27:52,899 --> 01:27:56,899
If I spent a month straight in a fourth or fifth grade class.

555
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,720
And I had to actually pay attention and take tests and shit.

556
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,720
And see if I could get over an 80.

557
01:28:06,619 --> 01:28:07,619
I think that would be really fun.

558
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:12,079
I might ruin my entire Twitch career doing that.

559
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:14,079
Because if every stream was just me in a class.

560
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:17,600
Like a fourth grade class.

561
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,600
I could get detention and stuff. It would be bizarre.

562
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:27,859
It wouldn't be fun.

563
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:29,859
That's why I'm not going to do it.

564
01:28:30,859 --> 01:28:31,859
Alright. Let's go. Here we go.

565
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:34,989
Family Feud coming up.

566
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:45,550
Do that hamster stream. No, I can't.

567
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:49,140
I can't do the hamster stream.

568
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:54,680
Who's the host in this is what I want to know.

569
01:28:57,579 --> 01:28:58,579
I wonder if it's one of the actual TV show hosts.

570
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:06,329
Because the whole thing is FMV.

571
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:10,359
Game tech.

572
01:29:16,979 --> 01:29:17,979
Family Feud. Fuck yeah. That's right.

573
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:24,890
What about the chocolate factory stream?

574
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:27,829
Just give me a minute.

575
01:29:28,829 --> 01:29:36,189
Let me just say quickly.

576
01:29:37,189 --> 01:29:39,430
Thank you for the $50 FS Woods.

577
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:41,670
5,000 bits. Insane.

578
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,680
Glad to see you back streaming.

579
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:45,680
Was super happy to hear that Valve named the scout after you.

580
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,109
Can't think of anyone more deserving.

581
01:29:49,109 --> 01:29:50,109
That's unbelievable that that was confirmed.

582
01:29:51,109 --> 01:29:52,109
I can't even fucking believe it.

583
01:29:54,439 --> 01:29:55,439
Family Feud. Thanks for the 50 bucks.

584
01:29:56,439 --> 01:29:57,439
It's a ton of money. It's too much money.

585
01:29:58,439 --> 01:29:59,439
Mole King also gave $50.

586
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm watching since my brother showed me a channel in middle school.

587
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Now I'm an adult and can pay you back for all the years of entertainment.

588
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
You're just being here is enough man. Don't worry.

589
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
That's a lot of money to give somebody.

590
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Thank you though.

591
01:30:13,779 --> 01:30:15,590
I'm ready. Let's go.

592
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:18,470
Game options. Start game.

593
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,470
All right. Game options.

594
01:30:21,649 --> 01:30:22,649
Music on. Yeah. Rapid play on.

595
01:30:23,649 --> 01:30:24,649
Difficulty. That's fine. Customize the rules.

596
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:26,649
Customize a family.

597
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:30,220
Yes.

598
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,220
How do I customize the family?

599
01:30:37,619 --> 01:30:38,619
Oh shit.

600
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:41,369
Name. Okay. Hold on.

601
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:44,119
These are the bumps.

602
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:47,119
Absolutely. That's Pecky Bump right there.

603
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,539
How do I? Oh shit.

604
01:30:53,539 --> 01:30:54,539
Okay. Hold on.

605
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,840
All right. This is the bump.

606
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,840
Right. The bumps family or is it bump?

607
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:05,840
Yeah. It's just not. It's not bump.

608
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,840
John bump. That don't matter.

609
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:09,840
Hobbies. Chess.

610
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:11,840
That's fine. Occupation. Doctor.

611
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:13,840
Intelligence. Genius. Yeah. That's good.

612
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,460
Pecky Bump.

613
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:20,300
You don't have to go through everybody's.

614
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,300
Q. Pecky Bump.

615
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:27,619
Bump. Remake.

616
01:31:28,619 --> 01:31:31,050
No, no, no, no, no. This is the bump in Netflix special.

617
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:33,050
This is real actors, man.

618
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:36,699
Age of 43. Dancing.

619
01:31:37,699 --> 01:31:38,699
Nurse. Intelligence. Good.

620
01:31:38,699 --> 01:31:39,699
Sure.

621
01:31:40,699 --> 01:31:41,699
Max Bump.

622
01:31:42,699 --> 01:31:43,699
Max.

623
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:46,130
And Eric Bump.

624
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:48,130
Eric Bump.

625
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:50,130
Might be a little.

626
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:52,939
Not Eric Bump.

627
01:31:53,939 --> 01:31:54,939
Zero.

628
01:31:57,529 --> 01:31:58,529
Eric Bump.

629
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,020
Okay. Intelligence.

630
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,020
Zero. All right. Max Bump is going to be pretty dumb.

631
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,260
Hopeless.

632
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,260
All right. Let's do.

633
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:10,770
Let's do hopeless.

634
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:12,770
John bump is definitely not a genius.

635
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:14,770
Max Bump I would say is pretty good.

636
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:16,770
Peggy Bump I'd say is.

637
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:18,939
Peggy Bump is a genius.

638
01:32:19,939 --> 01:32:20,939
Max Bump is hopeless.

639
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:22,939
Kathy Bump is poor.

640
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:25,939
And Eric Bump is hopeless.

641
01:32:27,949 --> 01:32:28,949
Should we do that? No.

642
01:32:29,949 --> 01:32:33,619
Because are they going to answer questions for me?

643
01:32:34,619 --> 01:32:35,859
Okay. That's fine.

644
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:40,409
That's fine. That's fine. That's fine.

645
01:32:41,409 --> 01:32:43,800
All right. The bump family is done.

646
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,810
Customize the. No. I want regular rules.

647
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:48,810
All right. Here we go. Family.

648
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:50,810
Family versus. Family. Family versus.

649
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:53,579
System.

650
01:32:54,579 --> 01:32:55,579
3DO system versus 3DO system.

651
01:32:56,579 --> 01:32:57,819
We can watch.

652
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:01,539
Keep that in mind.

653
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,489
All right. The bump family.

654
01:33:06,489 --> 01:33:10,800
That's me.

655
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,359
I'm so excited. Let's go. Let's go.

656
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:16,430
Let them kill each other.

657
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:18,430
We asked 100 people.

658
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:20,430
Name a food that's terrible when eaten cold.

659
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:22,430
Terrible when eaten cold.

660
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,060
A food that's terrible when eaten cold.

661
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,060
Hot dog.

662
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
No. Eggs. Eggs.

663
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,180
Hot dog. Egg.

664
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,420
Terrible when eaten cold.

665
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:38,300
Hot dogs are suck.

666
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:46,819
Hot dog. Cold hot dog.

667
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:55,060
That's disgusting.

668
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:59,409
One word.

669
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:02,220
Gravy.

670
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,220
Tea.

671
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:12,159
Ice tea is amazing.

672
01:34:13,159 --> 01:34:14,159
Corn.

673
01:34:15,529 --> 01:34:16,529
Ice tea is apparently disgusting.

674
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,220
Where they are. Corn.

675
01:34:21,289 --> 01:34:22,289
You grow a field of corn.

676
01:34:23,289 --> 01:34:26,449
Let's see what the survey said.

677
01:34:27,449 --> 01:34:29,520
All right. Let's bring it back.

678
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:31,520
Bring it back. Bring it back to the family.

679
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,520
Hi.

680
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:36,020
Was this like the bonus round?

681
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:38,020
How come we don't bring it back to the family?

682
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:47,859
What? Hair?

683
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,020
Hair piece?

684
01:34:54,279 --> 01:34:56,100
Eyeglasses.

685
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:58,100
All right. So what?

686
01:34:59,979 --> 01:35:00,979
Bullseye round?

687
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:07,989
If you're short on money, name the bill you delay paying.

688
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,170
The mortgage.

689
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,109
Rent.

690
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:17,770
Yeah. This is the bullseye round.

691
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:26,539
This is just to get some money in the bank.

692
01:35:28,859 --> 01:35:30,420
Wrong. What?

693
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:35,159
Clothes bill?

694
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:37,159
Is it the bullseye?

695
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,340
The clothes bill?

696
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:41,510
You have to pay?

697
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:43,510
It was like a subscription service?

698
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:46,329
Like a fucking loot box?

699
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:50,329
For $5,000, can you give me the bullseye answer to this?

700
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:53,079
Come on.

701
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:56,340
Name a year round sport.

702
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,340
A year round sport.

703
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,399
That would be darts.

704
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:06,710
Play darts at any moment at any time ever.

705
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:12,109
League of Legends.

706
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:16,000
Darts.

707
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,500
Oh, fuck you. It's darts. It's bowling.

708
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,500
Golf. You can't play golf a year round.

709
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:26,579
Fucking bowling. God damn it.

710
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,699
I thought it was going to be darts.

711
01:36:30,699 --> 01:36:31,699
It's all right. We've got a little bit of cash.

712
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:33,699
Let's go. Bump family. Bring it back.

713
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:43,550
$7,000. Let's go.

714
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:45,550
Who the fuck plays darts?

715
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,220
I didn't say anybody played it.

716
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,489
I just said it was a thing you could do year round.

717
01:36:54,489 --> 01:36:55,489
Try and give me the most popular answer to this.

718
01:36:56,789 --> 01:36:57,789
Name something fathers and sons do together.

719
01:36:58,789 --> 01:36:59,789
Shit.

720
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:04,130
I don't think so.

721
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:06,130
Let's see what the survey said.

722
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:08,130
No. It's going to be zero.

723
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,060
What? I get a chance?

724
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,060
Okay. Wait, he passed it?

725
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:20,060
Name something fathers and sons do together.

726
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,579
Catch.

727
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:26,590
It's going to be at least number two or three.

728
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:30,109
Oh, yeah. Talk, though.

729
01:37:32,949 --> 01:37:34,770
Talk is a great answer, but not catch.

730
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:37,710
Great. We have to get this.

731
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:39,710
Okay. Name something that fathers and sons do together.

732
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:53,380
Fishing.

733
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:55,380
I'm going to say fish. Yes. Fine.

734
01:37:58,729 --> 01:37:59,729
It's not even accurate.

735
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:01,970
Fuck. Wait, this is like 1993.

736
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:07,710
That is accurate.

737
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:09,710
Of course it is. Yeah, this is like 1991.

738
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:13,300
All right. What else?

739
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,939
Fish. What other father and son do together?

740
01:38:17,939 --> 01:38:19,760
Yard work?

741
01:38:21,189 --> 01:38:22,189
Yard work.

742
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,189
Mow the lawn? Lawn?

743
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:27,779
I want just lawn. Lawn care.

744
01:38:28,779 --> 01:38:34,560
Like yard work. Yard.

745
01:38:42,329 --> 01:38:43,329
I'm going to say yard work. That sounds good to me.

746
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:48,560
You go out of the yard, you mow the lawn.

747
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,930
Yard work.

748
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:55,979
Shit. I tried catch. Catch didn't work.

749
01:38:57,609 --> 01:39:00,829
What other father and sons do together?

750
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:03,970
Hunting? Camping?

751
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:07,789
My dad didn't go fucking camping.

752
01:39:08,789 --> 01:39:10,420
Camping. Barbecue.

753
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:19,619
Good answer.

754
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,460
Good answer.

755
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:25,460
Go camping.

756
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:32,750
Did you go fishing?

757
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:36,590
No, I never went fishing with my dad.

758
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:39,590
I think both of us saw that as something we didn't want to ever fucking do.

759
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,180
All right. What else is there?

760
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:45,930
Mow the lawn.

761
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:52,199
If hunting is on here, I mean, remember, anytime you go outside,

762
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:54,199
my dad's going to be there too, apparently.

763
01:39:59,539 --> 01:40:00,539
Is there anything outside of the house?

764
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:02,840
Like if you open the door and leave, I might as well put...

765
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:04,840
This 12 answers here.

766
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,140
There are 12.

767
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:10,470
Should I just put go get the mail?

768
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:15,909
There are 12 answers.

769
01:40:16,909 --> 01:40:17,909
I don't know. What the hell could possibly one person have said?

770
01:40:18,909 --> 01:40:23,670
Golf?

771
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:26,670
At some point, if you run this show, I think you cut off like three or four of the answers and just put like...

772
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:28,670
Get ready to steal.

773
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:32,319
Oh my fucking God.

774
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:35,390
You catch? I did catch.

775
01:40:36,569 --> 01:40:39,979
Drink.

776
01:40:40,979 --> 01:40:41,979
Dad?

777
01:40:42,979 --> 01:40:46,140
Who drank with their dad?

778
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:48,140
What he did.

779
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:52,050
Ball game.

780
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,050
I knew it. That's what I said.

781
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:56,050
I said catch, but then I said go to a game.

782
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,810
It's going to be number two.

783
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:08,210
Play ball.

784
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:10,210
Ball game.

785
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:13,539
Business.

786
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:19,170
I said golf.

787
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:21,170
You eat with your dad?

788
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:23,170
Yes, of course you do.

789
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:25,170
You live in the same fucking house.

790
01:41:27,689 --> 01:41:28,689
Of course you're going to eat at the same place.

791
01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:32,210
I don't like that.

792
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:35,210
I have a goldfish. Do you eat with your goldfish because they're in the same house?

793
01:41:39,649 --> 01:41:41,779
We asked a hundred people.

794
01:41:42,779 --> 01:41:43,779
Name any member of Britain's royal family.

795
01:41:44,779 --> 01:41:45,779
I have no idea. I have no idea.

796
01:41:46,779 --> 01:41:50,460
Don't pass it. I don't know.

797
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:52,460
Queen Elizabeth. That's it.

798
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:57,529
That's the only one I know. Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales.

799
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:02,390
That's not their name though.

800
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:07,260
That's not their name.

801
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:09,260
Fuck you. You didn't even say their name.

802
01:42:11,779 --> 01:42:14,869
Don't pass it. Please play it.

803
01:42:18,029 --> 01:42:19,029
Play it. Don't pass it.

804
01:42:19,029 --> 01:42:24,500
Queen Elizabeth. Queen Elizabeth.

805
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:26,500
Harry.

806
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:30,020
Charles. Who else is there?

807
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:45,039
Peter. Well played.

808
01:42:46,539 --> 01:42:47,539
Queen Elizabeth. That's number three.

809
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:49,539
That's weird. Okay. Harry.

810
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:54,720
Harry. Peter.

811
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:56,720
No, it's not that.

812
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:01,329
Harry.

813
01:43:02,329 --> 01:43:04,329
And then I'm going to cheat. I'm going to write just like Dutch or like Duchess.

814
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,960
Right? And I'll get something.

815
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:16,020
Let's say Harry.

816
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:24,710
Dutch.

817
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:27,210
I'm just going to put Dutch.

818
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:28,899
Dutch.

819
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:35,100
Duchess. Get ready to steal.

820
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,100
You didn't even say. You said Prince.

821
01:43:44,489 --> 01:43:45,489
What about Duke? Oh, wait.

822
01:43:46,489 --> 01:43:47,489
It's not Dutch. It's Duke.

823
01:43:48,489 --> 01:43:49,489
Duke and Duchess.

824
01:43:50,489 --> 01:43:52,300
Fuck.

825
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,300
It's not Dutch and Duchess.

826
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,760
Come on. Give me Duke.

827
01:43:58,760 --> 01:43:59,760
Give me Duke. Duke of...

828
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:01,760
The Duke of...

829
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:03,760
Oh my fucking God. I don't know.

830
01:44:10,439 --> 01:44:11,439
Princess.

831
01:44:13,829 --> 01:44:15,069
Princess Fiona.

832
01:44:16,069 --> 01:44:17,630
Princess Fergie?

833
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:20,130
Good answer.

834
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:27,539
Sarah Ferguson.

835
01:44:28,539 --> 01:44:29,539
Prince Andrew.

836
01:44:30,539 --> 01:44:36,369
Well, I would have gotten one.

837
01:44:37,369 --> 01:44:38,369
I was about to take a sip.

838
01:44:39,369 --> 01:44:40,369
I was about to take a sip out of my drink.

839
01:44:41,369 --> 01:44:42,369
And I like had to stop because I would have spit it out.

840
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:47,920
Is this a commercial?

841
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:52,340
What's going on? Oh, okay.

842
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:54,340
We asked 100 people.

843
01:44:56,539 --> 01:44:58,539
Name something that's written on a college diploma.

844
01:44:59,539 --> 01:45:00,539
Congratulations. Good luck.

845
01:45:01,539 --> 01:45:02,539
Congratulations. Good luck. Congratulations.

846
01:45:08,189 --> 01:45:09,189
Wait, but this isn't a birthday card.

847
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:10,189
Hold on.

848
01:45:11,189 --> 01:45:12,189
It says congratulations.

849
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:18,460
Congratulations.

850
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:22,619
How do you spell congratulations? Am I doing it right?

851
01:45:33,529 --> 01:45:35,529
I feel like it's a fucking million letters long.

852
01:45:36,529 --> 01:45:38,729
This looks wrong.

853
01:45:39,729 --> 01:45:41,729
This looks incorrect because it's so huge.

854
01:45:42,729 --> 01:45:49,340
This is right, isn't it?

855
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:54,659
What?

856
01:45:57,109 --> 01:46:00,210
Type of degree.

857
01:46:03,109 --> 01:46:04,109
What are you talking about? What do you mean type of degree?

858
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,350
Like field of study?

859
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:08,590
It says congratulations on it.

860
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:10,590
It's like a birthday card.

861
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:12,590
That gives you access to jobs.

862
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:16,369
Oh, shit. Okay.

863
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:21,810
Something that's written on a college diploma.

864
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:23,810
What's the thing called?

865
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:25,810
What is it called?

866
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:27,810
It's like with...

867
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:30,810
It says like some Latin or Greek or something, was it?

868
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:37,449
The name of the school.

869
01:46:38,449 --> 01:46:39,619
Name of school. That's good. Good.

870
01:46:40,619 --> 01:46:48,069
Good answer.

871
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:56,140
Name of school.

872
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

873
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:04,409
Just name. Right. Like your name is on it.

874
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:10,539
Well played.

875
01:47:10,539 --> 01:47:11,539
Latin words, right?

876
01:47:12,539 --> 01:47:13,710
Oh, the Greek letters.

877
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:15,710
Greek letters. Greek or Latin?

878
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:17,710
Latin. I'm just going to write Latin.

879
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:26,340
Latin words. I don't think Latin is on it.

880
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:33,300
Greek letters, not Latin letters.

881
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:37,520
The name of the school. We just said name though.

882
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,270
College name.

883
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:42,270
College. What about...

884
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,500
College is college name?

885
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:48,670
The university's name?

886
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:55,460
The date. Oh, date is a good one.

887
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:57,760
Date. What did the survey say?

888
01:47:58,760 --> 01:47:59,760
Okay. Your name, the date, the type of degree.

889
01:48:01,449 --> 01:48:02,449
And like good luck or something.

890
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:09,270
Like a check for five dollars from your grandmother that you don't even want to cash.

891
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:12,270
Because it's like I got to go to the bank and cash a check for five bucks.

892
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:16,739
I don't know.

893
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:22,739
Signature. The dean.

894
01:48:23,739 --> 01:48:24,739
Whoever the dean is, right?

895
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:34,960
Signature. Yeah. Yeah.

896
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:42,380
Somebody has to sign it. Somebody has to prove you did it.

897
01:48:48,489 --> 01:48:49,489
Signature.

898
01:48:50,489 --> 01:48:51,489
Come on. Yes.

899
01:48:52,489 --> 01:48:53,489
All right. We got one more here, boys and girls. What is it?

900
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:58,909
Dean's phone number.

901
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:00,909
Name of college. Name of the...

902
01:49:01,909 --> 01:49:03,470
That's what I said before, but name was our...

903
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:05,470
Name of school. School name.

904
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:08,470
School name. School name. School name. School name. School name. School name.

905
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:19,930
School name.

906
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:26,840
Get ready to steal.

907
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:29,770
School. Just school. Just type school.

908
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,840
Only school. But why can't they tell what I was trying to say?

909
01:49:36,659 --> 01:49:37,659
Major. Oh.

910
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,520
No. No, no, no. Wait. Isn't that already there?

911
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,520
As like field of study or like what you did?

912
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,979
School. I'm sorry. School.

913
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,520

03:38:40,840 --> 03:38:42,840

I just bounced off that person. All right, I got I got a rider right here

1884
03:39:05,229 --> 03:39:14,959

03:39:26,299 --> 03:39:36,799

11

1893
03:39:53,500 --> 03:39:56,219
I think that that slime on the ground was sentient

1894
03:39:56,860 --> 03:39:58,860
It just I just that just just felt pain

1895
03:39:59,340 --> 03:40:02,940
How do I get weapons?

1896
03:40:02,940 --> 03:40:06,540
Holy shit. That was just air. That was huge air over that business man

1897
03:40:06,860 --> 03:40:24,059
Going way too fast

1898
03:40:24,059 --> 03:40:27,129
Shit, what did I bump into?

That person on the street was just trying to punch god damn it

1902
03:40:50,350 --> 03:40:55,579
Is there a kick or anything? Do I have to unlock punches and kicks?

1903
03:40:57,979 --> 03:40:59,520
You idiot

1904
03:40:59,520 --> 03:41:01,520
Like what a fucking asshole

1905
03:41:01,520 --> 03:41:03,520
And I i'm gonna can I grab him?

1906
03:41:11,040 --> 03:41:12,559
Get out of the way

1907
03:41:12,559 --> 03:41:20,079
Oh, you can kick. Okay. How did I do that? It's down

1908
03:41:25,440 --> 03:41:27,440
When does the race end am I gonna i'm gonna lose

1909
03:41:33,420 --> 03:41:35,420
Kick is op. All right. Good to know

1910
03:41:41,209 --> 03:41:43,370
All right. Here we go. I got time

1911
03:41:44,090 --> 03:41:47,180
Just don't even focus on hitting anybody

1912
03:41:47,180 --> 03:41:51,309
Don't you get a weapon eventually like a baseball bat or something or like a chain or something?

1913
03:41:55,479 --> 03:41:57,479
Wow, that was a lot of people there

1914
03:41:58,200 --> 03:42:02,620
Okay, I just kicked that guy off the map

1915
03:42:02,940 --> 03:42:07,100
That is the biggest taxi i've ever seen

1916
03:42:07,100 --> 03:42:12,750
Third place. Let's go

1917
03:42:12,750 --> 03:42:14,350
Second place. Let's go

1918
03:42:14,350 --> 03:42:17,659
Let me win this race

1919
03:42:17,659 --> 03:42:18,540
Fine

1920
03:42:18,540 --> 03:42:27,290
Everything's fine

1921
03:42:27,370 --> 03:42:35,469
Oh

1922
03:42:35,469 --> 03:42:37,469
Damn it. I really thought I was gonna pass him

1923
03:42:37,870 --> 03:42:42,239
Give money for placing

1924
03:42:42,239 --> 03:42:53,819
I was gonna say with the mask on

1925
03:43:06,139 --> 03:43:08,940
winner

1926
03:43:08,940 --> 03:43:10,459
Second place. All right

1927
03:43:10,459 --> 03:43:15,389
a second place winner

1928
03:43:18,639 --> 03:43:20,569
nice

1929
03:43:20,569 --> 03:43:22,569
Second place. That's 750 bucks

1930
03:43:22,969 --> 03:43:25,290
All right. Now let me go buy a bat or something. Here we go

1931
03:43:29,600 --> 03:43:36,760
Okay, mechanized rodents of the urban jungle. They squeak they crawl rat bikes super bikes. All right rat bikes

1932
03:43:37,639 --> 03:43:42,319
These are way too expensive. These are three thousand dollars

1933
03:43:43,040 --> 03:43:45,040
I don't have even close to enough money

1934
03:43:45,280 --> 03:43:48,159
All right, uh the street get out of here sports bikes. I don't have enough money

1935
03:43:50,590 --> 03:43:52,590
All right back into the uh, the bar

1936
03:43:53,069 --> 03:43:57,790
It moves. I think it's the exact same

1937
03:43:58,350 --> 03:44:03,290
It's the same thing. All right the street

1938
03:44:05,079 --> 03:44:06,600
Nothing else I can do

1939
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:11,020
All right bulletin board

1940
03:44:11,020 --> 03:44:12,620
sierra nevada

1941
03:44:12,620 --> 03:44:16,780
Thunder through what's left of the great northwestern timberland into the nappa valley

1942
03:44:19,600 --> 03:44:23,049
avoid tourists

1943
03:44:23,049 --> 03:44:25,709
Uh blast through the traffic congested suburban wasteland

1944
03:44:29,260 --> 03:44:31,739
Face dead man curves and sheer cliff walls

1945
03:44:32,379 --> 03:44:35,770
Oh, yes, we will

1946
03:44:35,850 --> 03:44:37,850
tourists tourists, whatever

1947
03:44:38,090 --> 03:44:41,479
Click on the link. Hold on. Let me see

1948
03:44:42,040 --> 03:44:44,670
Let me screen this one

1949
03:44:46,559 --> 03:44:50,569
I don't get it. What is it? What am I supposed to be looking at here?

1950
03:44:58,200 --> 03:45:07,389
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait

1951
03:45:07,389 --> 03:45:08,350
What?

1952
03:45:08,350 --> 03:45:18,030
That's that's me. I mean that's the exact clothes that I wear and it's kind of the same hair color

1953
03:45:18,030 --> 03:45:25,440
I guess that's all that's the only resemblance. All right, let's go

1954
03:45:28,799 --> 03:45:32,729
Oh

1955
03:45:32,729 --> 03:45:34,889
I don't even know why I ran that guy over that was uncalled for

1956
03:45:35,450 --> 03:45:52,540
It's so hard to do this. It's so hard to get somebody

1957
03:45:53,500 --> 03:45:54,620
like that

1958
03:45:54,620 --> 03:46:07,260
I can't even hurt him

1959
03:46:07,260 --> 03:46:08,780
Come on. Hurry up

1960
03:46:08,780 --> 03:46:14,540
God dammit, whatever

1961
03:46:14,780 --> 03:46:26,360
I got plenty of time

1962
03:46:26,360 --> 03:46:28,200
No ronda

1963
03:46:28,200 --> 03:46:32,670
Just run the whole race. I'm not why would I torture you guys like that?

1964
03:46:33,309 --> 03:46:43,799
It would be torture. All right, here we go

1965
03:46:48,809 --> 03:46:50,250
That was tight

1966
03:46:50,250 --> 03:47:03,200
Okay, am I crazy or do you get like a bat and like a whip and stuff?

1967
03:47:09,680 --> 03:47:11,680
Yeah, you do. Okay. Yeah, just i'm just checking

1968
03:47:12,159 --> 03:47:16,120
I gotta get in first place for that

1969
03:47:16,280 --> 03:47:21,469
It's the other game. Oh

1970
03:47:33,260 --> 03:47:35,500
So focused on hurting people that I can't even drive

1971
03:47:36,139 --> 03:47:51,870
Come on. Fuck you, dude

1972
03:47:52,110 --> 03:47:55,149
It's the barefoot bandit. Yeah, it kind of is isn't it?

1973
03:47:55,790 --> 03:48:07,280
That's a good pass right there

1974
03:48:07,280 --> 03:48:11,200
Should I do enough to at least buy a new bike? I should have it if I get in first place. I'll have it

1975
03:48:20,379 --> 03:48:22,239
Yeah

1976
03:48:22,239 --> 03:48:23,600
second place

1977
03:48:23,600 --> 03:48:27,610
first place

1978
03:48:27,610 --> 03:48:28,569
Wait

1979
03:48:28,569 --> 03:48:38,030
I'm in first place. How did I get in first place? Was I supposed to go right?

1980
03:48:38,829 --> 03:48:47,579
Did I miss the shortcut? Are you sure or did I accidentally do the shortcut?

1981
03:48:49,389 --> 03:49:02,559
first place

1982
03:49:02,559 --> 03:49:05,120
So quiet like eerie

1983
03:49:12,079 --> 03:49:16,319
My brain is telling me that the game crashed because of the audio and I know it didn't

1984
03:49:17,040 --> 03:49:27,450
first place

1985
03:49:27,450 --> 03:49:29,450
All right, make way for the champion

1986
03:49:41,559 --> 03:49:43,709
uh

1987
03:49:43,709 --> 03:49:45,709
What the fuck was that?

1988
03:49:52,809 --> 03:49:58,670
What the fuck run to the rash finished in first place? I got another thousand bucks

1989
03:49:58,670 --> 03:50:00,510
All right. So now I have enough for a bike

1990
03:50:00,510 --> 03:50:04,649
I'm, sorry. I just punched you. No, I don't do I come on two thousand bucks

1991
03:50:05,610 --> 03:50:08,989
rat bike

1992
03:50:08,989 --> 03:50:10,489
299

1993
03:50:10,489 --> 03:50:12,700
324

1994
03:50:12,700 --> 03:50:15,950
Shit, I need to win another race. What about a super bike?

1995
03:50:18,430 --> 03:50:21,629
No, these are this is like you're gonna play the game for more than 40 hours. No

1996
03:50:26,040 --> 03:50:27,479
Trade in

1997
03:50:27,479 --> 03:50:30,829
I can trade in my bike

1998
03:50:30,829 --> 03:50:35,659
What do I have?

1999
03:50:35,659 --> 03:50:39,659
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why why shouldn't why can I read?

2000
03:50:40,719 --> 03:50:42,829
Okay

2001
03:50:42,829 --> 03:50:44,350
This one is

2002
03:50:44,350 --> 03:50:48,219
This one here. How about this one?

2003
03:50:48,219 --> 03:50:53,200
250 cc the thing that no one ever picked in mario kart because it was way too hard

2004
03:50:53,680 --> 03:50:58,879
50 or 100 cc only these games the game became fucking possible after 100 cc

2005
03:50:59,920 --> 03:51:01,520
Uh, what was I saying?

2006
03:51:01,520 --> 03:51:11,500
How about the killer rat? How much is that one? I don't have enough. We're gonna do the

2007
03:51:13,500 --> 03:51:15,180
I'm gonna do the kamikaze

2008
03:51:15,180 --> 03:51:34,010
Let's go. It's pretty good. This little two-stroker has smoked some bigger bikes in this time. Now it just smokes

2009
03:51:35,309 --> 03:51:39,950
Handling crisp moderate acceleration substandard top speed

2010
03:51:40,590 --> 03:51:42,639
I think sucks

2011
03:51:42,639 --> 03:51:46,840
How much is a what about like a a super bike or a sports bike?

2012
03:51:47,639 --> 03:51:54,239
No, these are all way too expensive. It's worse than what I have sports bike

2013
03:51:54,879 --> 03:51:58,030
13 grand

2014
03:51:58,030 --> 03:52:00,510
11 grand. No, I don't have I have to buy one of the shitty ones

2015
03:52:01,069 --> 03:52:04,590
Yeah, I gotta buy one of the shitty rat ones

2016
03:52:07,159 --> 03:52:09,479
Corsair bike

2017
03:52:09,479 --> 03:52:11,479
All right. What about the corsair bike?

2018
03:52:21,079 --> 03:52:23,079
RGB bike

2019
03:52:23,159 --> 03:52:24,360
Oh

2020
03:52:24,360 --> 03:52:26,920
Let's get it

2021
03:52:26,920 --> 03:52:29,639
non top speed non negotiable

2022
03:52:30,340 --> 03:52:32,340
acceleration imperceptible

2023
03:52:32,920 --> 03:52:35,079
Handling. Yeah, I mean like these are huge words

2024
03:52:36,100 --> 03:52:38,100
Wait, this is like I already have

2025
03:52:41,239 --> 03:52:45,659
Oh, all right. We're gonna go with the paro

2026
03:52:50,680 --> 03:52:56,540
Acceleration a bad joke a bad joke. Whatever. I'm just gonna get it. You bought yourself a new bike. Keep the rubber side down

2027
03:52:57,180 --> 03:53:06,700
All right. Let's give it a try

2028
03:53:06,780 --> 03:53:10,840
What we got on the board here

2029
03:53:10,840 --> 03:53:14,040
Your panzer club hang out with your buds and pick up your next race

2030
03:53:18,659 --> 03:53:24,579
All right napa valley fix the mic delay. Has there been a mic delay?

2031
03:53:25,540 --> 03:53:35,450
Couldn't be

2032
03:53:35,450 --> 03:53:41,399
There is a delay. How bad is it? It's a very slight delay

2033
03:53:44,010 --> 03:53:49,770
You said there was a delay. Yeah, but I compensated for it by making my microphone of 1000 milliseconds slower

2034
03:53:50,569 --> 03:54:03,940
It's a new bike

2035
03:54:03,940 --> 03:54:06,340
I'm seeing your moves before you do them

2036
03:54:06,500 --> 03:54:08,500
Um

2037
03:54:08,739 --> 03:54:12,819
No, one of us get by that car that's fucking ridiculous. No way somebody had to get hit by that thing

2038
03:54:13,780 --> 03:54:19,290
What do you mean the bike sucks? Look at the handling

2039
03:54:27,500 --> 03:54:31,260
Funniest part about this is it really had a mature audience warning

2040
03:54:33,159 --> 03:54:49,690
I really think they do this in mario kart now. This game reminds me of what you hear when you get a concussion

2041
03:55:10,200 --> 03:55:21,659
It's true

2042
03:55:28,260 --> 03:55:30,260
Oh

2043
03:55:31,219 --> 03:55:33,219
That was some wacky racer shit right there

2044
03:55:34,180 --> 03:55:43,000
Can I pass this guy? I need to get into first place

2045
03:55:43,639 --> 03:55:49,879
over the car

2046
03:55:49,879 --> 03:55:55,190
I can't unhear that now

2047
03:55:55,770 --> 03:55:57,770
What happens when you get a concussion?

2048
03:55:58,250 --> 03:56:00,809
I feel it and I hate it that I feel it

2049
03:56:06,659 --> 03:56:08,659
What how did you not fall off?

2050
03:56:20,899 --> 03:56:22,899

04:13:40,729 --> 04:13:43,049
The disc just made a really awful noise in there

2195
04:13:43,770 --> 04:13:47,610
That was not a good sound. I don't know if my noise gate might not have picked that up. That was a crunch

2196
04:13:48,920 --> 04:13:52,250
Just went

I don't know how long it's been four and a half hours. It's all right. We're okay

2201
04:14:10,250 --> 04:14:13,129
How hot is it? It's a little hot. It's a little warm

2202
04:14:13,930 --> 04:14:21,930
You're smelting the disc

You guys have a wire head

2207
04:14:38,159 --> 04:14:43,120
I'm getting lots of wire head vibes from psychic detective. That's probably gonna have to be an entire stream

2208
04:14:50,540 --> 04:14:52,540
I'm saving some of these ones

04:14:53,049 --> 04:14:56,409
We'll go through some of the fun ones to veto and just play for like 30 minutes 40 minutes

2210
04:14:57,049 --> 04:14:59,850
But there are some that are going to be probably at least four or five hours

04:15:00,409 --> 04:15:04,940
It's gonna die

2212
04:15:04,940 --> 04:15:06,459
Wait, what happens if he dies?

2213
04:15:06,459 --> 04:15:11,629

But why did he buy see a 45 health down?

2215
04:15:14,670 --> 04:15:22,959
I didn't lose. Well, do I need to kill for this?

2216
04:15:23,520 --> 04:15:26,840
They do it

2217
04:15:27,319 --> 04:15:29,319
No, this is the boss zone

2218
04:15:29,559 --> 04:15:35,959
I need to heal

2219
04:15:41,389 --> 04:15:43,709
It's a missing texture, I don't think it's a missing texture

2220
04:15:45,920 --> 04:15:51,469
Don't lose all your bad

2221
04:15:51,469 --> 04:15:52,959
That's okay

2222
04:15:52,959 --> 04:16:02,479
I'm not concerned about that

2223
04:16:02,479 --> 04:16:07,680
What you worms dare oppose our lord azrael, all right, then die

2224
04:16:11,309 --> 04:16:20,120
Music change. Why do we get a music change? Okay. I gotta heal him

2225
04:16:26,780 --> 04:16:40,750
Four that's it. The soundtrack's pretty good. Yeah, it is

2226
04:16:46,809 --> 04:16:51,159
These defense panels maybe they are

2227
04:16:53,719 --> 04:16:59,229
Well, that hurt all right. Well now he's off that panel. Let's see if we can get him

2228
04:17:00,030 --> 04:17:09,680
Yeah, yeah, that's a little better

2229
04:17:10,799 --> 04:17:12,760
Holy like this guy

2230
04:17:12,760 --> 04:17:24,090
You got a new soundtrack you can play

2231
04:17:24,409 --> 04:17:36,270
It's true

2232
04:17:36,270 --> 04:17:40,200
He's focusing the healer. That's smart. I'm not gonna do you any good though

2233
04:17:42,409 --> 04:17:44,889
Holy light might affect multiple targets. It's lined up

2234
04:17:45,770 --> 04:17:49,680
maybe

2235
04:17:53,209 --> 04:17:55,850
This is cool, this actually is pretty cool

2236
04:17:56,969 --> 04:18:05,610
What IGN give us?

2237
04:18:05,610 --> 04:18:07,690
52 damage. Holy shit. That was a lot

2238
04:18:08,329 --> 04:18:12,940
Are we surprised if IGN reviewed this game?

2239
04:18:15,319 --> 04:18:17,319
7.8 out of 10

2240
04:18:17,319 --> 04:18:19,760
That's not bad

2241
04:18:20,239 --> 04:18:22,239
That's not bad

2242
04:18:25,709 --> 04:18:32,299
Wait, oh this is the this must be the boss there's a ton of health. I gotta heal myself

2243
04:18:36,139 --> 04:18:42,920
Look up the meta critic scores

2244
04:18:44,600 --> 04:18:54,040
You just said i'm gonna veto this game

2245
04:18:54,120 --> 04:18:59,680
I know I know but I just want to get at least to pass the first level or two. I don't believe this

2246
04:19:04,700 --> 04:19:06,700
Feeded all the enemies nearby

2247
04:19:06,940 --> 04:19:16,329
Okay, let's go done

2248
04:19:17,770 --> 04:19:25,049
You win

2249
04:19:25,049 --> 04:19:40,430
You go very talking. Who's just talking? Okay. Well, do I have to go there? I guess we this is the next squad

2250
04:19:41,549 --> 04:19:51,069
Land of east canal. There are 17 enemies to feed them all. All right

2251
04:19:52,350 --> 04:19:56,590
This is a fun game. It's a cute game, but we got a lot of 3DO games to get through

2252
04:19:59,879 --> 04:20:03,799
It's cool though. I like it. Let me just try to see if I can get holy light on more than one person

2253
04:20:04,280 --> 04:20:09,639
You know what I mean? Like I have to figure that out first. I know just wait. I vetoed it already

2254
04:20:19,930 --> 04:20:24,170
It's it's vetoed trust me. I just want to see if I can wholly light on one person in the line like you know

2255
04:20:24,170 --> 04:20:25,209
two people

2256
04:20:25,209 --> 04:20:29,260
Holy light

2257
04:20:29,260 --> 04:20:31,260
Even get these both these people

2258
04:20:34,170 --> 04:20:37,930
No, they're not lined up. It's just right there. All right, that's cool. That's cool. All right. All right

2259
04:20:38,649 --> 04:20:45,739
It's fun game. The game's cool

2260
04:20:45,739 --> 04:20:48,620
That was guardian war. I highly recommend it if you

2261
04:20:49,180 --> 04:20:53,200
Um want to have like a bag of cheetos after school late for like a couple hours a day

2262
04:20:54,000 --> 04:20:57,079
That's what I would do

2263
04:20:57,079 --> 04:21:00,969
All right. Let me put in let's put in the probably one of the last one or two of the night

2264
04:21:02,010 --> 04:21:03,049
today

2265
04:21:03,049 --> 04:21:05,840
Do probably a couple more

2266
04:21:05,840 --> 04:21:10,010
I gotta pee again

2267
04:21:10,010 --> 04:21:12,010
I'm peeing on the hour almost every hour

2268
04:21:12,569 --> 04:21:16,809
Let's give me a break every exactly. It's been exactly every hour and 30 minutes, hasn't it?

2269
04:21:18,729 --> 04:21:21,500
It has been

2270
04:21:21,500 --> 04:21:25,899
First time I went pee was an hour and 30 second time was three hours and now it's four hours and 30 minutes

2271
04:21:26,459 --> 04:21:29,600
I'm on an exit i'm on a schedule apparently i'll be right back

2272
04:21:30,239 --> 04:24:08,190
Okay, this next one

2273
04:24:08,350 --> 04:24:09,959
is

2274
04:24:09,959 --> 04:24:12,120
Probably the one that i'm most interested in

2275
04:24:13,719 --> 04:24:15,719
Not because I think the game's gonna be any good

2276
04:24:15,959 --> 04:24:18,760
Because like the game's gonna be fun to play or there'll be something interesting

2277
04:24:18,760 --> 04:24:21,639
But just because this is one of the most expensive 3do games

2278
04:24:22,520 --> 04:24:25,850
The game is called captain quasar

2279
04:24:27,309 --> 04:24:32,489
Made by studio 3do and it was the most expensive game. I don't know why

2280
04:24:39,629 --> 04:24:40,670
Break it

2281
04:24:40,670 --> 04:24:43,149
Yeah, all the expensive ones we smash over our heads

2282
04:24:44,200 --> 04:24:46,200
How much was it? I don't want to say

2283
04:24:46,200 --> 04:24:49,579
I don't want to say because it's embarrassing

2284
04:24:49,579 --> 04:24:54,780
But hey remember I own it forever and it's mine forever and I have it and it'd be worth probably three grand in five years

2285
04:24:56,399 --> 04:25:00,079
No, it was not more. Okay. It was not more than a hundred dollars. Okay, I promise

2286
04:25:00,719 --> 04:25:20,479
Captain quasar that's not captain quasar. That's captain quasar. Apparently this game's worth more than 200

2287
04:25:23,600 --> 04:25:29,280
The universe was once a lovely place to live broad smiles beamed from every planet in the milky way

2288
04:25:29,760 --> 04:25:37,040
Law abiding galactic citizens thrived under the happy twinkling stars and goodwill flowed from one end of the cosmos to the other

2289
04:25:37,840 --> 04:25:40,159
But then things changed

2290
04:25:42,879 --> 04:25:44,879
Are you hearing my voice first?

2291
04:25:53,840 --> 04:25:59,280
Is this the sad twilight of our glorious civilization are these the last ticks of the cosmic clock? Oh dear

2292
04:25:59,520 --> 04:26:03,600
Where are we to turn? What are we to do? What? Oh, what is to be our face?

2293
04:26:08,989 --> 04:26:17,920
Relax oh my goodness here he comes captain quasar

2294
04:26:34,510 --> 04:26:37,959
Me

2295
04:27:11,500 --> 04:27:14,700
I hope there's a musical interlude before every level every awesome

2296
04:27:16,219 --> 04:27:31,209
Watch this be a fucking card game a disappointing, right?

2297
04:27:44,639 --> 04:27:49,370
That's a clap for me there that was awesome captain quasar

2298
04:27:50,329 --> 04:27:51,930
reviews

2299
04:27:51,930 --> 04:27:55,530
Always watch previous first before the movie. I hope it's the same basketball game

2300
04:27:59,420 --> 04:28:01,420
Battle an encounter between opposing forces

2301
04:28:09,319 --> 04:28:11,319
Same bet is the basketball game

2302
04:28:17,290 --> 04:28:20,489
Battle sport, do I have this?

2303
04:28:27,239 --> 04:28:29,239
Holy shit, I don't think I have battle sport

2304
04:28:29,879 --> 04:28:31,079
I might

2305
04:28:31,079 --> 04:28:50,729
Would you actually play ball?

2306
04:28:53,049 --> 04:28:55,129
Rocket league, but

2307
04:28:55,129 --> 04:28:56,649
I don't say that

2308
04:28:56,649 --> 04:28:58,170
Don't say that

2309
04:28:58,170 --> 04:29:00,170
Is this like rocket league?

2310
04:29:13,209 --> 04:29:16,409
It is rocket league, but there's no weapons in rocket league. There's no missiles

2311
04:29:17,290 --> 04:29:23,819
That looks fun

2312
04:29:23,819 --> 04:29:36,299
All right remind me to go over my collection of like 30 games that are still left over here and look for battle sport

Yeah, this music's giving me anxiety

04:36:18,430 --> 04:36:23,159
I'm out of ammo for everything

04:36:23,159 --> 04:36:28,119
I have nothing left

2375
04:36:28,119 --> 04:36:32,009
What do I do now?

04:36:32,009 --> 04:36:36,639
Wait, can I get in the water?

04:42:29,479 --> 04:42:32,509
Shit, someone got away

2427
04:42:32,509 --> 04:42:34,349
All right double power-up

2428
04:42:34,349 --> 04:42:48,540
Why am I dying so fast?

2429
04:42:51,740 --> 04:42:53,740
This is not really space music to me

2430
04:43:03,740 --> 04:43:07,259
There's only so much I could like destroy silos. How do I leave?

2431
04:43:08,060 --> 04:43:09,900
I want to end the mission

2432
04:43:09,900 --> 04:43:12,590
I think I did enough

2433
04:43:12,590 --> 04:43:24,669
I did enough come you get to choose what space sounds like

2434
04:43:26,090 --> 04:43:30,779
Um, I don't know. What do you why do you get to choose what it doesn't sound like?

2435
04:43:44,000 --> 04:43:47,580
shit

2436
04:43:47,580 --> 04:43:49,580
How many more silos?

2437
04:43:50,080 --> 04:43:52,400
I don't want to do any more silos, dude

2438
04:43:53,040 --> 04:43:55,659
It's endless

2439
04:43:55,659 --> 04:44:00,299
Don't shoot me. I'm just a cadet. Um, my name is dumb star

2440
04:44:01,040 --> 04:44:05,259

What is the objective?

2448
04:45:28,650 --> 04:45:30,650
This is stupid

2449
04:45:42,080 --> 04:45:44,979
There is no objective there has to be an objective

2450
04:45:45,919 --> 04:45:48,669
Don't worry. I never wanted to be a criminal

2451
04:45:48,669 --> 04:46:09,279
I thought I signed up for a bellhop position on pleasure planet power-ups. I'm invisible and I have super speed

2452
04:46:09,360 --> 04:46:11,360
This is this is not fair

Teleporter if you insist on attacking i'll have you know that this boot camp doesn't fall easily. Okay. Goodbye

04:46:41,919 --> 04:46:46,270
This wasn't 200 dollars. We need to get that clear

2457
04:46:47,069 --> 04:47:00,060
This is the same room of just firing machine guns

04:47:58,520 --> 04:48:01,720
But I mean it's expensive. So I mean that means something right?

I'm over 30. I have my arthritis in my fingers. I don't eat

2485
04:50:06,029 --> 04:50:08,909

begin transmission dear mom

2488
04:50:15,130 --> 04:50:19,209
What a crappy day or really crappy it just seemed like a sweet deal back at base

2489
04:50:19,930 --> 04:50:26,810
Imitate an ice cube for three months eat some dumb mercs for two weeks and then three more months in the fridge on the ride home

2490
04:50:27,529 --> 04:50:30,970
Two weeks of work for six months of pay not bad. Not bad at all

2491
04:50:31,049 --> 04:50:34,090
Well, the cook is always the last to know what the hell is going on

2492
04:50:34,729 --> 04:50:36,729
This is like a riddle of what food am I?

2493
04:50:37,049 --> 04:50:40,729
I never would have taken this if I knew it was going to be a bug hunt

2494
04:50:41,290 --> 04:50:45,450
I hate bug hunts the mercs got greased inside half an hour. No surprise

2495
04:50:46,220 --> 04:50:49,740
They were all a bunch of sorry-ass stim freaks too bad

2496
04:50:49,740 --> 04:50:52,220
They're the ones who knew how to move this crate

2497
04:50:52,540 --> 04:50:57,500
I've been awake three hours help is three months away and the bugs that we already managed to blast a few holes in this ship

2498
04:50:57,659 --> 04:51:01,099
I figured my chances are better outside than being a sitting duck out here. The weapons are gone

2499
04:51:01,099 --> 04:51:04,220
But my firing brain is gone gulps got to run things are heating up

2500
04:51:04,220 --> 04:51:12,060
I guess it's time to find some fresh meat love ox ai dungeon

2501
04:51:16,080 --> 04:51:24,750
Hey, that's good. Okay. Here we go. Is that good? Let's jump. What's my I have a frying pan

2502
04:51:24,909 --> 04:51:36,479
That's actual frying pan. What's the top left supposed to indicate? Is that my health? What is the feet? What's the feet for?

2503
04:51:40,279 --> 04:51:44,110
How do I get over this?

2504
04:51:44,110 --> 04:51:46,110
It's there's a feet cam

2505
04:51:57,049 --> 04:52:07,279
All right, kill him

2506
04:52:07,279 --> 04:52:11,279
Why is that? I don't know why that whose feet are those those my feet. I don't get it

2507
04:52:11,759 --> 04:52:22,669
All right, i'm gonna go this way. Don't I did I jump too far?

2508
04:52:27,639 --> 04:52:33,720
Okay down something behind me

2509
04:52:46,380 --> 04:52:48,380
I got stuffed under something

2510
04:52:48,380 --> 04:53:10,880
I can't just die in the first room. Okay, I made it going up. Can I get a gun?

2511
04:53:11,279 --> 04:53:27,790
Okay, what's this log in? I can't log in there. I have no login. Oh shit. Okay in here

2512
04:53:32,560 --> 04:53:34,919
The weapon no, it's just health

2513
04:53:38,299 --> 04:53:40,299
only pan and feet cam

2514
04:53:46,439 --> 04:53:52,330
Nice am I okay?

2515
04:53:57,000 --> 04:54:00,680
So what happened the lower health that I get do I get like a doom when my feet get more crusty or what?

2516
04:54:02,729 --> 04:54:05,130
What's no, what's the indicator up? What does that mean?

2517
04:54:05,450 --> 04:54:22,080
Like do I get we get dirty bare feet for the more health I lose. Let me try this again

2518
04:54:22,159 --> 04:54:42,000
I just put it on easy. Let's just go down. It's your feet level. Somebody's got the speed run on this. I'm sure it's insane

2519
04:54:43,319 --> 04:54:46,599
Switch to the feet weapon. I only have a frying pan. I don't have anything else

2520
04:54:54,860 --> 04:55:16,169
Get out of there and only so far we get drew crew. It's time for a feet fleet

2521
04:55:17,040 --> 04:55:21,439
All right, don't fuck this up. Just go here. Let me go across is this hurt

2522
04:55:22,080 --> 04:55:28,599
It's not I want to get to at least one new weapon

2523
04:55:29,080 --> 04:55:52,220
Eat fleet feet fleet now. None of you guys actually want to see this game played you guys are painfully typing that and then

2524
04:55:54,380 --> 04:55:56,380
Rolling back in your seat going. Uh

2525
04:55:56,939 --> 04:56:12,959
And somebody just look up poed. What does the feet meter do? It has to be a reason for its existence

2526
04:56:13,599 --> 04:56:19,400
It doesn't just exist for no reason. I see a weapon over there. It looks like a weapon, right?

2527
04:56:26,909 --> 04:56:28,909
Oh shit. What is it then?

2528
04:56:28,909 --> 04:56:32,189
Oh, get me out of here. Get me out. Get me the fuck out. Get me out. Just get me out

2529
04:56:36,090 --> 04:56:38,090
I don't want this on my history

2530
04:56:38,639 --> 04:56:41,599
It's on no it's on my history and did I fall through?

2531
04:56:42,240 --> 04:56:50,159

2532
04:56:52,250 --> 04:57:02,439
What the fuck just happened why did it go up I can't ride it up

2533
04:57:03,240 --> 04:57:14,560
Being crushed

2534
04:57:14,560 --> 04:57:16,959
I don't think I can take it anymore. I don't think I take it. I think I have to stop

2535
04:57:17,040 --> 04:57:27,209
I can't take it anymore. It's I can't do it. It's freaking me out. This is fucking me up. I can't captain

2536
04:57:27,209 --> 04:57:30,009
Quasar made me physically ill and now I don't know what to do

2537
04:57:41,759 --> 04:57:46,400
What this is your basic travel mode? You can change your foot speed between normal and turbo

2538
04:57:47,360 --> 04:57:50,759
Press x what?

2539

2540
04:57:54,330 --> 04:57:56,330
It's just to put shoes on button

2541
04:57:59,630 --> 04:58:03,069
That made it so much worse that made it worse, but I wanted to be a feet again. I'll throw up

2542
04:58:03,229 --> 04:58:13,500
Wait new weapon. How do I change that? What's throwing?

2543
04:58:21,959 --> 04:58:25,000
Nice. Okay. What is this fucking game? I don't know man

2544
04:58:25,639 --> 04:58:28,220
Something that's about to get vetoed in exactly 30 seconds

2545
04:58:28,779 --> 04:58:39,020
It wasn't even running shoes either

2546
04:58:44,360 --> 04:58:52,880
Go up. What the fuck get up there and quasar i'm gonna puke in my own lap

2547
04:58:53,520 --> 04:59:00,299
All right, which one goes up? Let's go over this way

2548
04:59:00,619 --> 04:59:08,729
Okay

2549
04:59:08,729 --> 04:59:12,119
Okay. Okay. Okay

2550
04:59:12,119 --> 04:59:15,240
Okay. No, i'm done. I have to veto this I have to veto the whole stream actually

2551
04:59:15,959 --> 04:59:18,459
I gotta get up. I'm gonna puke

2552
04:59:18,459 --> 04:59:20,459
I'm not even kidding either. That's the worst part

2553
04:59:21,720 --> 04:59:25,049
We made it to five hours. We're good

2554
04:59:25,130 --> 04:59:27,130
That was a bare feet

2555
04:59:27,209 --> 04:59:30,560
video game

2556
04:59:30,560 --> 04:59:32,159
I'll see you guys tomorrow

2557
04:59:32,159 --> 04:59:35,040
Tomorrow, I don't know if we're gonna do 3do

2558
04:59:35,360 --> 04:59:38,000
Um, I mean we might need a 3do break stream tomorrow

2559
04:59:38,479 --> 04:59:43,709
I'd do something else or we might just start one of the long form 3do games

2560
04:59:45,979 --> 04:59:50,939
So tomorrow we're not gonna blow through like six seven plus games on the 3do. If I play it again

2561
04:59:50,939 --> 04:59:55,150
We're gonna do like psychic detective or we'll do something else

2562
04:59:56,959 --> 05:00:01,020
I will see you guys tomorrow. Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking around as always

2563
05:00:02,110 --> 05:00:07,340
Uh, thanks for the like 800 subs. It's been an absolute insane amount

2564
05:00:09,389 --> 05:00:12,270
Oh ftk, right? I want to tell you ftk is happening

2565
05:00:12,909 --> 05:00:14,909
on october 3rd

2566
05:00:15,069 --> 05:00:21,419
That is the new date for ftk saturday the 3rd in the afternoon. I believe starting at 3 pm

2567
05:00:22,060 --> 05:00:31,470
Pacific time it is not happening next weekend or this weekend. I wasn't exactly sure the moment I was going to come back

2568
05:00:32,119 --> 05:00:36,119
So I just decided look let's just push it out. So I know that i'll be back, right?

2569
05:00:36,279 --> 05:00:42,459
So october 3rd is the new date. That's when everybody can kind of reconvene and do it all over again

2570
05:00:45,319 --> 05:00:49,689
And I will see you guys

2571
05:00:49,689 --> 05:00:55,290
But let's show the credits because it's probably going to be insane because there were like 6 000 community subs earlier

2572
05:00:57,069 --> 05:01:04,250
Look for battle sport. That's right. I will let's uh go over there. Here they come

2573
05:01:05,759 --> 05:01:15,020
In alphabetical order going at insane speed unreadable. Thanks everybody for subscribing. Thanks all the community subs

2574
05:01:15,020 --> 05:01:18,439
It's been a lot. I think I missed a lot of subs

2575
05:01:18,759 --> 05:01:23,049
It was just coming in so hot that I I couldn't even catch them

2576
05:01:24,569 --> 05:01:34,669
Thank you everybody to continue to give this stream insane amounts of money. I hope it's worth it. Thank you

2577
05:01:34,909 --> 05:01:42,680
Turbo credits, that's right. Yeah. Well, maybe well maybe we'll switch away from 3do tomorrow

2578
05:01:43,319 --> 05:01:47,000
There's so much I have for it. I'd rather let's spread it out a little over the next couple of weeks

2579
05:01:47,000 --> 05:02:01,880
What do you say seems like a good idea to me saw saw saw

2580
05:02:02,439 --> 05:02:07,599
Let's do a raid. Yeah, you know what somebody is streaming right now that uh, mr
