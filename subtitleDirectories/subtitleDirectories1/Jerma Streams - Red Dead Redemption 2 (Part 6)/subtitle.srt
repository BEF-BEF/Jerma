1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:18,519
All right, so let me... yeah, we can hop in Red Dead. We'll jump in Red Dead for like an hour or two,

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,870
so I can kind of prepare myself for tomorrow.

3
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:35,799
Tomorrow being the multiplayer that I'm going to try. It seems any fun. Red Dead 2

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,539
incoming. What do you mean incoming? Red Dead 2, here it comes! Red Ted 2, Red Ted...

5
00:00:48,500 --> 00:01:04,140
Red... why can I not say words? I need to like eat something. Holy shit. If you stuck around

6
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:12,659
just for... I was gonna say insane aquarium. For... I really do need to like eat something,

7
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,900
holy shit. I'm like floating by right now for some reason. If you're there for Zoo Tycoon 2,

8
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:25,189
thanks for coming out. Hopefully you stop by tomorrow when we play Red Dead online.

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,040
I'll see you soon. If not, when... I'll see you whenever you come back.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,829
Make the entire map of Red Dead 2 in Zoo Tycoon. Well that is... that is just... that just ain't

11
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:48,219
gonna happen. Let me boot up my PlayStation 4 here. Shouldn't take me more than a minute

12
00:01:48,219 --> 00:02:04,260
or so to get this ready. Red Dead Redemption. Jesus, what a lazy guy.

13
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,360
Do you know how long it takes to do stuff like that? It would take me like a year to do

14
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:28,139
that. Let me get this going. Yeah, we'll go... we'll try to get like another couple story missions

15
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:49,189
done just so I can kind of familiarize myself with it again. Am I gonna do any conventions

16
00:02:49,189 --> 00:03:05,159
this year? Oh, no. Not for the... you mean 2019? Yeah, but I'm... what? What is this?

17
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:11,210
Why is this here? What's this for? I just turned on the PlayStation and this is what was

18
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:29,979
here. I don't know why. Is this the last thing that you saw from two nights ago? Play it.

19
00:03:40,099 --> 00:04:08,819
I just put it on Red Dead. One more match. Just make Red Dead characters.

20
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:34,220
That's gonna take me like seven hours. I kind of want to... no, I'm not gonna make

21
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:49,139
Red Dead characters. I'm gonna press the wrong button. No, no, no. It's gonna take... wait,

22
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,790
like, I... let's play... we're gonna play Red Dead. Don't worry. You'll see this again sooner

23
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:05,860
than you did the last time. One match. Maybe I might... okay, we'll end on one match. How's that

24
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:27,220
sound? I do want to get some Red Dead in though. Yeah. We'll do that. Okay. Because

25
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:38,490
that's gonna take me to make characters now that's up here. Organize community rumbles.

26
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:46,600
Um, the reason why I don't really do them that often is because it kind of loses its...

27
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:55,740
the reason why it's so special to me and to the community in general is because I put a

28
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,300
shitload of time into making a ton of characters and the kinds of... there needs to be enough...

29
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:15,459
Can I just play it now? No. There needs to be enough time as to pass for there to be new

30
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:21,459
characters to make. Because sure, I could just make a bunch of people from before, from older

31
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:29,160
games and throw them in or older rumbles, but I like the idea of each one having a

32
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,000
significant amount of people that were, you know, new ideas, new characters, new interesting

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:50,199
things over the course of six to 12 months. And eventually transitioning away from the video

34
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:57,589
game. Because as a lot of you guys know, I desperately want to make another live one,

35
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:06,180
and but this time actually do it live. I've hinted at it, talked about it a little bit.

36
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,110
Like do a live rumble, like for real, like an actual live German Rumble 2 live

37
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:34,920
stream. Live CGI rumble? No, it would be... the resources that are available

38
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,319
on this side of the country, it wouldn't be that hard of a thing to do.

39
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,490
All right, what was the last thing I did? I don't know if it's been so long.

40
00:07:49,209 --> 00:08:00,379
Who's gonna be on the... he's gonna be at that rumble? I mean that's... I'm not gonna...

41
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,779
why would I tell you that? I can't like tell you all the secrets,

42
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,459
you keep on... am I gonna tell you every single secret?

43
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,990
All right, let's open up the map and see where the hell we are. So I gotta go...

44
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:21,800
here's Micah, which I've not done. Still have not completed that mission,

45
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,439
and I don't think I'm gonna. This is where we left off.

46
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:35,690
Oh, should I just do it? No, I don't want to do that.

47
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:45,129
Let's go... is there stagecoach over here? Trapper post office stagecoach.

48
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,019
Let's ride the stagecoach, Bill. Yeah, this is single player.

49
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,740
I don't have access to the multiplayer until tomorrow,

50
00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:02,899
so I just wanted to familiarize myself with the game again,

51
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,779
because then tomorrow I'm gonna stream the multiplayer.

52
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,519
Is it familiar yet? You could say that, yeah.

53
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:27,850
It only took 10 seconds to get there, so now we could go across this way.

54
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,549
My horse is in desperate need of yummy cakes.

55
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,860
All right, let's go. The story gets real good, it's worth finishing.

56
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:52,389
Yeah, that's what I've heard. I think when we stopped that was 40-50% of the way done.

57
00:09:53,269 --> 00:10:04,470
Is that just about the 40% mark? You gonna finish LA?

58
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:12,009
Nah, I'm not gonna finish LA Noir. We talked about LA Noir, but it's not.

59
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:18,789
LA Noir is a really, really great game, but I could...

60
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,129
Did I do that? I didn't do that, did I? I didn't do anything.

61
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:38,250
What did I do? I didn't do anything. Do you want to overwrite the data?

62
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:53,429
I guess. Is that horse better than this horse?

63
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:15,639
Wait, what? Well, this is a good horse, apparently.

64
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:22,330
I mean, that is... It's not stealing if the guy's dead.

65
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,620
In the Wild West, that is. You gonna let me on?

66
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,879
Yeah, this is gonna work. It's also a murderer, where the horse is a murderer.

67
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,539
I'm not a murderer. Not yet, at least. Not now.

68
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:53,830
You're gonna let me... Okay.

69
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,610
I kind of need to take this horse somewhere, though, don't I?

70
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,110
Follow me. Is there a stable here?

71
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:16,009
Because if there is, then I could at least stable this one.

72
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:29,259
Hey there, mister. Can you only have four?

73
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,019
I think you can only have three or four horses here. Something like that.

74
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,990
This thing is fast. All right, cool.

75
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,909
Uh, how much money do I have? Because I can pay my bounty.

76
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:56,230
But is there a stable? What did I just do?

77
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,789
What did I do? Oh, I ran a guy over!

78
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:05,590
I ran that guy over! What?

79
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,379
Oh, come on. No, no! Get away from me!

80
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,220
I forgot how to fucking melee fight.

81
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:34,970
Don't always check your blind spots. I just slid into that dude.

82
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:52,649
He slid into that guy's DMs.

83
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:58,539
I'm gonna pay the bounty.

84
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,929
I don't even know what happened. That guy was like a squirrel.

85
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,539
I road killed a guy and I didn't even know he was there.

86
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:20,409
Was he sleeping on the ground? Look at that.

87
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:26,700
That's what every criminal says.

88
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,659
Well, I'm not a criminal. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

89
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,259
I wasn't even going that fast either.

90
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:43,350
All right, here we go. I'm gonna go pay the bounty.

91
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,269
I'm gonna go take care of everything. Go to the story mission.

92
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:58,409
Cool. Would you like you to stable this horse?

93
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,210
There we go. All right, I gotta name it.

94
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,889
So I got horsebag sonic, whisper thunder, and then...

95
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,720
Actually, this horse is way better. This horse is fucking 10 times better.

96
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:21,990
All right. Who am I taking out?

97
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,259
This is... No, actually, I want to...

98
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,059
Give me a whisper.

99
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,419
Wow. Name him skateboard. For what?

100
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:39,509
Is that a lot?

101
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:44,409
All right, let's do services.

102
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,570
Horse care package.

103
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,940
Name him something. Epic gamer. What do I mean?

104
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,210
All right, let's pay the bounty. Take the stagecoach.

105
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,000
And to get the absolute hell out of here.

106
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:15,080
How many bits do you have to spend to name him skateboard?

107
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,960
Get out of my fucking way.

108
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,460
Everyone just gets in my way.

109
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:28,230
No, I'm about...

110
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,870
How do I say please take me and take me to the jail?

111
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,200
Where's the please take me to jail?

112
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:44,120
That guy just spun around in a circle on the bridge.

113
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,159
Look, I'm here. I'm ready to take everything.

114
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,519
I'll be held accountable for all of it.

115
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,339
Did I just die? What?

116
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,599
No, okay. I was gonna say how the fuck.

117
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
I thought he instantly killed me.

118
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:43,609
So did I pay? You don't lose anything by going to jail, do you?

119
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:55,609
Does that not include my bounty? Did my bounty paid?

120
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:06,619
My guns are gone or not?

121
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,900
No, I'm good. I got all my weapons.

122
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:19,059
Springfield rifle. Bolt action rifle.

123
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,029
Yeah, please don't scare me like that.

124
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,190
If I run another person over.

125
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,839
All right, I need to go to the stagecoach.

126
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,940
Stagecoach, let's go.

127
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,609
And then I need to go from here to here.

128
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:44,809
So we gotta go to Rhodes.

129
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:46,890
Rhodes Ranch.

130
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:56,779
I probably could... I need to turn it up a little bit.

131
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:58,220
There we are.

132
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,579
That probably sounds a little better.

133
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,329
So don't steal it.

134
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,930
I haven't played the game in like almost two weeks.

135
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,769
So I'm sorry. I like bumped into a guy.

136
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:44,970
I bumped into another guy.

137
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:57,190
For the love of God, just go there yourself.

138
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,970
Where's the fence?

139
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:05,660
He's up here.

140
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,509
Is there another wagon fence?

141
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,640
This is so far away.

142
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:19,269
This is so fucking far away.

143
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,220
You just spend the whole time breaking laws.

144
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:34,789
I need to wait till this is gone.

145
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:43,180
What the hell was that?

146
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:44,700
Coyotes?

147
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:46,299
Going after a rabbit?

148
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,440
Yeah, that is what it is.

149
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:58,549
No, what if I bring this back?

150
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:01,740
I'm gonna bring this back to the guy that I just took it from.

151
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:16,420
I found it.

152
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,460
Look, it's right here.

153
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:30,490
I just wanted to say good morning.

154
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:38,220
All right.

155
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,500
Your stagecoach is back.

156
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,109
Let's go ahead and take a ride.

157
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,309
Rhodes Ranch.

158
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:57,960
See, where's the...

159
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,720
I crashed into a tree joke.

160
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,599
There... I didn't...

161
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,200
There is no crash into tree joke.

162
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
I already fell down a cliff.

163
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:17,609
Does that count?

164
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,170
I'm not sure.

165
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:31,460
All right, let's do it.

166
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:32,819
Time for a mission.

167
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,380
It only took us 25 minutes.

168
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,220
A little less than that.

169
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,019
Not very much.

170
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,559
Talk to Bill.

171
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,670
Come on, that's classic.

172
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,470
I didn't do it this time.

173
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,109
The horse did.

174
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:57,019
Cartoon Jerma crashes into a tree.

175
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,630
Well, it's a really good thing somebody said that.

176
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,700
Thank you for saying that because

177
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,559
my microphone was not correctly synced up.

178
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:23,750
Now it is.

179
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,700
It was almost a full millisecond behind.

180
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:30,569
Or ahead, actually.

181
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,369
How's it now? Let's see.

182
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:38,259
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

183
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,740
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

184
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,380
Should be good.

185
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,950
What is that guy?

186
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,490
I couldn't watch with the delay.

187
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,210
I'm so sorry.

188
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,849
I didn't realize it.

189
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:07,930
We just came from a PC game, so...

190
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,420
For my capture card, it's a 650 millisecond delay.

191
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,289
So I have to offset the mic, so...

192
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:15,849
Sorry about that.

193
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,309
Hey, Bill!

194
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,140
What can I do for you?

195
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,539
What is it?

196
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,900
We got something cooking.

197
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,259
You might be interested in.

198
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:43,259
Am I gonna like the sound of this?

199
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:45,019
Been cooking since Horseshoe.

200
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:48,140
But you went and kicked up all that commotion in Valentine.

201
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,059
Now we was preparing to rob the bank there

202
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,339
until you got involved in all that nonsense and...

203
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:53,819
I don't know.

204
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:55,900
I just feel like it's unfinished business.

205
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,180
That wasn't my fault.

206
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,940
It was just one of them things.

207
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,259
How come every time I get in trouble,

208
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,180
I'm called a fool and an idiot?

209
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,539
But when you get in trouble,

210
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:06,779
oh, it's just one of them things.

211
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:07,900
It's a good point, Arthur.

212
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,420
A very good point.

213
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,349
Well, what do y'all want me to do?

214
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:15,109
Hit the goddamn bank with us.

215
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:16,069
I love my Nerf bullet.

216
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,990
My backup Nerf bullets.

217
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,630
You really think it's worth going back there?

218
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,390
Four of us can hit the bank easy.

219
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,829
Did I make that joke two weeks ago?

220
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:24,390
I might have.

221
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,190
We linger.

222
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,349
Did I say that two weeks ago?

223
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:29,910
Just local boys get rounded up and pressed into action.

224
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,869
Two weeks ago.

225
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,630
If we go in quick and quiet,

226
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,230
we can hit it just fine.

227
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,910
If there's four of us, I mean.

228
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,869
Y'all think it's worth the risk.

229
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:40,789
It's a bank, Arthur.

230
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:45,430
So is the take good, according to the fella I met?

231
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,069
Yes.

232
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:47,829
It's the end of the stock sales.

233
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:50,390
Plenty of money and plenty of people milling about.

234
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:57,589
OK, I suppose we're taking a look at least.

235
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,549
I'm going to be performing.

236
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:00,789
I better go get old material as usual.

237
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,430
OK, so Bill, this better be good.

238
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,630
It is good.

239
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,630
We put a lot of research into this one.

240
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,210
I hope so, Mr. Morgan.

241
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:14,809
Her stress?

242
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,609
That man.

243
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:16,410
The daughter?

244
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,130
Thomas Downs?

245
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,490
Apparently, he's dead.

246
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,130
Dead?

247
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,009
Remember my clothes.

248
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,130
Oh, he didn't seem very well.

249
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,009
His wife.

250
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:23,529
I believe he has a wife and child.

251
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:24,009
We all change?

252
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,609
She will assume the debt, of course.

253
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:26,490
Of course.

254
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,569
Then you can head up there and collect.

255
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:29,930
We lent them a lot of money.

256
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,490
OK.

257
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,049
Gentlemen, let's go rob ourselves a bank.

258
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,170
What's the plan there?

259
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,049
I remember my clothes.

260
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,170
We're going to send Karen on in ahead as a distraction.

261
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,329
Then we're just going to rush on in afterwards.

262
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:42,170
Just a small bank in a little town.

263
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,930
Nothing that big in way of security.

264
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:48,009
We just need to bring you along as an insurance policy.

265
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,250
He's read the evidential to a sequel.

266
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,450
It is a prequel.

267
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,799
You ever see Star Wars the Phantom Menace?

268
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,589
It's like that.

269
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,299
There's only one difference though.

270
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:10,059
It does not take place in Star Wars.

271
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:14,059
Tell me again about this big can't go wrong family horse.

272
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:16,460
Oh, it can go wrong.

273
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,819
Anything can.

274
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,259
Once the shooting starts.

275
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:22,220
Well, that's reassuring.

276
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,339
Like I said, we'll see how it looks.

277
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:32,380
If we can get in all right, we'll send this Jones into the bank.

278
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:32,779
Yep.

279
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:34,460
They won't recognize her.

280
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,180
I'll show you boys how it's done.

281
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,339
What are you thinking this time?

282
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,619
I don't know.

283
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:41,420
That wasn't even my fault.

284
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,660
Fellers always like a lost little girl.

285
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,059
But nobody plays a drunken harlot boy like me.

286
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:48,779
It should work.

287
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,660
Once he's got them distracted, we'll move in.

288
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,859
When I was scouting the place the other day.

289
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:56,539
There was only a couple of guards.

290
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,460
We deal with them and any customers who are feeling brave.

291
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,740
And you always fancy yourself as the Bolt Man, right Arthur?

292
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,539
It was inconsiderate.

293
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,019
It was rude.

294
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,380
I see why you brought me.

295
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,180
It was untrue.

296
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,259
Hey, I'm more than willing.

297
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,140
It was very rude.

298
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,380
Best I do it.

299
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,579
Oh, and did Doug tell you I've also been cooking up some deals with them gray boys?

300
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,099
What?

301
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:21,579
No.

302
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,299
Banned that guy.

303
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:27,099
Nobody gets banned for making a reference to Star Wars.

304
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:29,339
I'm out there putting in the work same as you.

305
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,380
I've been drinking with them a couple of times now.

306
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,579
Let's turn and run me off the road.

307
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,220
It seems you're looking for some extra security.

308
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,539
Yeah, I'm sure they are.

309
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,059
Could be something in it for us.

310
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,660
Well, just be smart about it.

311
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:45,900
Got a lot of irons in that fire right now.

312
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,940
You mean Star Trek?

313
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,420
Yes.

314
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,460
I know, Morgan.

315
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,480
Well, Star Trek.

316
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,220
Can't believe if you got me going back to Valentine.

317
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,019
Don't tell me it ain't hurt you leaving that bank behind.

318
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:03,059
What do I think about sand?

319
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:03,700
Not really.

320
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,619
Work in town and not hit the bank?

321
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,660
The desert?

322
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,059
The beach?

323
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,099
That's counter empathetic.

324
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,259
I guess we went a bit beyond working it.

325
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,099
We shot the place to hell.

326
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,940
You did, Morgan.

327
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,059
Not me.

328
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,299
I played it cool up there.

329
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,059
A couple of punch-ups.

330
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:23,539
Dealt with some old Driscolls.

331
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:26,259
What do I think about sands from Undertale?

332
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:28,740
Like I said, you mess up.

333
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,500
It's just one of them things.

334
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,980
I mean, it's a character in the game.

335
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,339
Well, Bill, I don't know what to tell you.

336
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
Surprised you ain't already ripped me about that dynamite yet.

337
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,259
This is a pretty great loading screen.

338
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:43,740
Yeah, it is.

339
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,180
One mistake.

340
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:46,859
And I'll never live it down.

341
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:47,900
That looks really, really cool.

342
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,380
Look at that.

343
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,339
What do you think?

344
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,220
Pet on the back?

345
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,099
It's beautiful.

346
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:51,980
A medal?

347
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,339
Just know, I got the lead on this one.

348
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:58,859
We'll see about that once things get going.

349
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,539
Not paying attention is a bingo for me.

350
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,980
So, thinking this through?

351
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,019
Are you paying attention?

352
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:07,019
You rob Cornwall's train?

353
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,410
Or shoot a heap of his men in Valentine?

354
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:13,130
I'm his stage coach.

355
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,450
This is just dawning on you now.

356
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,730
And now, we're going back to the one place he knew where to find us.

357
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,329
That's the genius of it.

358
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,009
Folk never look at what's right under their nose.

359
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:26,809
I know what's going to happen here.

360
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:29,210
I ain't sure that's always true.

361
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:31,289
What's happened to you?

362
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,569
You're getting real nervy in your old age.

363
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,809
Last few weeks happened.

364
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:39,529
Forget about Cornwall.

365
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:40,089
Forget about Bill.

366
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,490
He can't have many men left at this point.

367
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:45,210
Got a bit hairy in that barn.

368
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,250
But we all walked away fine from that.

369
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,650
You don't walk away much.

370
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,089
If four of us could deal with them in Valentine.

371
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:57,529
And four of us could deal with them after the coach robbery.

372
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:58,890
I ain't too worried.

373
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:01,049
If you say so.

374
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,609
Quit messing with the cord.

375
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,420
Running into a rough patch here for some reason.

376
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:22,890
Don't celebrate too early.

377
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,769
Yeah, I don't really.

378
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:40,380
This music is very appropriate for the tension.

379
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:52,470
Maybe if your camera was off it would work a little more smoothly.

380
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,349
I don't have my camera.

381
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:54,230
What do you mean camera?

382
00:31:55,349 --> 00:32:02,339
Up the contrast a little bit.

383
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,190
I don't think the stream is going to die.

384
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,869
I think we may have just hit a little bit of a rough patch.

385
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:33,269
Famous, famous last words.

386
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:45,940
How come they're not talking anymore?

387
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,680
Next frame please.

388
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,380
Gentlemen, here we are.

389
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:08,420
Okay, get ready.

390
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,450
All right, you ready?

391
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:14,650
Let's do it.

392
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,089
I am prepared.

393
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,119
Okay, go to work.

394
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:20,619
Of course.

395
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,940
All right, keep it cool and follow me, fellas.

396
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,559
Powerpoint Red Dead.

397
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,380
Oh, we're good, we're good, we're good.

398
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,420
We never decided.

399
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:49,109
Is it lost little girl you want or the drunk in Harlem?

400
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,140
I think the drunk in Harlem.

401
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,220
Of course, you know I like the Harlem.

402
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,400
You're the only one.

403
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,920
No, it must have been the green screen man.

404
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,880
You're a bunch of filthy sinners and the heartbreakers.

405
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,519
Now where is he?

406
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,599
That's pretty good.

407
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,880
He's pretty good.

408
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,840
Good luck, gentlemen.

409
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,280
We got this.

410
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,070
I've never seen anyone not pick the Harlem.

411
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:15,829
I know.

412
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,860
I'm 100% certain that every stream you've ever seen do this.

413
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,340
It was okay.

414
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,139
We're going.

415
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,300
Huh, hold on.

416
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,980
Wait till she's gone real dead.

417
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,699
Until he lands.

418
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:30,920
Okay.

419
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,849
Am I ready to burst through here?

420
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,530
There we go.

421
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,809
Nobody move.

422
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:47,510
Get on the ground.

423
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,010
Good.

424
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,510
Nice toss.

425
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,570
Elizabeth.

426
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,170
Ammo.

427
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:05,989
Open that vault right now.

428
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,019
Open it.

429
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,380
Is he pretending?

430
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,849
I'm just fucking with his concentration.

431
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,449
I'm making him start over again.

432
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,929
He's got it, right?

433
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:51,269
Open the safe.

434
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:55,670
Am I actually resetting him?

435
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,679
That was...

436
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,320
I didn't do that.

437
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,820
He did.

438
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,119
All right.

439
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:03,519
Here we go.

440
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,019
I'm in.

441
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,980
Someone come make sure the chute behaves himself in here.

442
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:09,019
What do we need?

443
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:09,579
What are we looking for?

444
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,099
Open the lock boxes now.

445
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
Wait, if he doesn't know, we can't hold this against him.

446
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,909
This guy's been hitting the head so many times he's gonna forget who he is.

447
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:24,199
Crack them or blow them.

448
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:24,920
Keep an eye out.

449
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,000
I'll be as quick as I can.

450
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,719
Crack?

451
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,599
Crack the safes.

452
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,920
Yeah, I think I should be able to crack these.

453
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,400
Why did I do that?

454
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,119
I should have blown one.

455
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,880
But you better be quick.

456
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,159
I should have blown him up.

457
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,039
I should have blown the...

458
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,519
Oh, no.

459
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,320
I should have blown him up.

460
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,119
I should have blown him up.

461
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:14,909
I almost got one.

462
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:18,460
I almost got one.

463
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,500
I almost have one.

464
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,519
Okay, I got one.

465
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,440
Only five more to go.

466
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,360
That's so much money.

467
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,079
Okay, hold on.

468
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,360
I gotta actually pay attention.

469
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:43,519
Come on.

470
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:44,880
Find it, Arthur.

471
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,760
That was quick.

472
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:57,550
That was three grand.

473
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,349
How much is in this one?

474
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:59,389
Three grand in every one of them?

475
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:01,630
Four thousand.

476
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,269
Holy shit.

477
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,039
I had it.

478
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,440
I'm trying to go too fast.

479
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,820
You motherfucker open.

480
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,840
Right here, right here, right here, right here, right here.

481
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,480
Right here.

482
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:35,880
Right here.

483
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,670
Come on.

484
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,070
I only have two more to get.

485
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:58,829
I got the first one quick.

486
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:01,710
Here it comes.

487
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,030
Come on.

488
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,429
Right here.

489
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,750
I went through the whole thing.

490
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,070
Fuck.

491
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,210
Two.

492
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:11,769
Here's three.

493
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:12,010
Right here.

494
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:12,489
I just had it.

495
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:13,130
It was 60.

496
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:14,940
Was it 60?

497
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:15,739
Yep.

498
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:30,139
Blow up the last two.

499
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:31,260
No, I got it.

500
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,579
I got it.

501
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:32,460
I got it.

502
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,059
I don't need to explode anything.

503
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:35,179
I just missed it.

504
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:35,659
It was right there.

505
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:43,260
It's right here.

506
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,539
Right here.

507
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:48,619
It's right here.

508
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,739
It's right here.

509
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:50,300
Got it.

510
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:50,619
Told you.

511
00:39:51,340 --> 00:40:04,380
Got them all.

512
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,500
That's it, right?

513
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,030
Is it as simple as it seems?

514
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:11,309
Fairly.

515
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:13,840
Fairly simple.

516
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,070
How are we doing on frames?

517
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,369
Did you kill the bank teller?

518
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,480
You did.

519
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,170
You got hit in the head one too many times.

520
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,210
You didn't have anything on him either.

521
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:34,909
I bet you shouldn't have hit him three or four times.

522
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,670
Frames are good.

523
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:46,829
Yeah.

524
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:51,309
I think we just ran into a rough patch.

525
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:52,750
I don't think it's an actual issue.

526
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,070
Speaking very, very cautiously on that.

527
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:04,170
But are we just calmly walking out of here?

528
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,300
Someone's robbed the bank.

529
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,099
All right, we've got to go.

530
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:15,900
Lawmen.

531
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:19,789
My horse just got shot.

532
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,449
That's not good.

533
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,159
Dead or alive.

534
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:26,800
Out, out, out.

535
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,119
Let's go.

536
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,429
Everybody has to live.

537
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:32,989
I'm going to take a different weapon out here.

538
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,960
Yeah, repeater.

539
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,789
Maybe I won't need to shoot anybody.

540
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:43,389
It might be a good idea to get out of here.

541
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,900
Pretty swell, actually.

542
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,460
That's pretty great.

543
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,559
Maybe I'll have to get out though.

544
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,480
Because I don't want to go too far ahead of everybody.

545
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,639
I forgot how to use that on.

546
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,159
I forgot how it worked.

547
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,260
I had to hit R1.

548
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:15,230
Remember now.

549
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:22,300
I can't wait to play this online.

550
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,500
This is probably something fun.

551
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,570
Has anybody watched any of the online?

552
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,210
How does it...

553
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,800
Is it fun or is it dumb?

554
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:54,409
Good shot.

555
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,210
I hope I can get it.

556
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,110
It looks okay from what's there now.

557
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,190
It actually has a story.

558
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:08,670
That's cool.

559
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:12,400
It still is the beta.

560
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,719
That's...

561
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:13,440
Yeah, that's great.

562
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,599
Very interested in how it's doing right now.

563
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,400
Because GTA Online was cool, but...

564
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:49,389
Thanks.

565
00:43:49,389 --> 00:43:50,269
I think we lost him.

566
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:51,550
Thank you, gentlemen.

567
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:53,949
I'm so glad that didn't happen.

568
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:55,550
Because I would have had to do the whole thing over again.

569
00:43:58,349 --> 00:43:59,949
And I would have been really upset.

570
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:00,510
I would have gone...

571
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,309
What? Oh, no!

572
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:02,510
I had to do the whole thing again?

573
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,309
What the fuck?

574
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:03,789
Do you know what?

575
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:04,670
I was just messing around.

576
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,030
Holy shit.

577
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,230
It's taking this guy two weeks to get through chapter two.

578
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,389
I haven't played it.

579
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:24,030
I haven't really put any time into it.

580
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,230
I've been too busy with other stuff.

581
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:27,630
Too many other things going on.

582
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,570
Ride to the ranch.

583
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:47,559
It's still in Anor Londo, I see.

584
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,000
God, I miss that game.

585
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,130
I miss souls.

586
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:58,559
I really do.

587
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,940
Sekiro is going to be so much fun.

588
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,739
It looks great.

589
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:12,670
Have I played Bloodborne before?

590
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:20,219
You are referencing probably my favorite single player video game ever made.

591
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:24,349
Did somebody say Bloodborne?

592
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:25,949
Oh, now you're going to get him started.

593
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,280
Now he's not going to stop talking about it.

594
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:34,679
Here we go.

595
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:36,119
Now it starts.

596
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:37,559
He's not going to stop.

597
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:43,239
Yeah, I have not beaten it on stream.

598
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,760
That is true.

599
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:50,989
But I'm excited for a lot of things, actually.

600
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:56,889
Like I told you guys earlier in the stream,

601
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,440
I want pretty much every other weekend or so,

602
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,239
or once a month,

603
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,329
to not only do new games that are coming out,

604
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:11,289
but more stuff that you've never seen before.

605
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:12,730
From me, at least.

606
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,179
There's another thing coming up at the end of December.

607
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:18,300
That should be a lot of fun.

608
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,619
Tons of games coming out at the beginning of the year.

609
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:23,019
I'm fucking, it's going to be a lot of fun.

610
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:23,579
I can't wait.

611
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,659
Hey, my fault about the way the world is.

612
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:39,019
He didn't have a choice.

613
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,219
You're playing the Lego games?

614
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:41,260
He was good and he did good.

615
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,340
There wasn't no choice in that.

616
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,820
And you was good as killed him yourself.

617
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,579
And don't kid yourself.

618
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:48,539
You had a choice.

619
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,019
You speak as if killing were something I cared about.

620
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:52,940
You ever wonder about eternity?

621
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,420
You should.

622
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,820
I hope it's hot and terrible, Mrs. Downs.

623
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,139
Otherwise, I'll feel I've been sold a false bill of goods.

624
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:00,699
Now, please give me that money.

625
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,300
Stop hogging the internet.

626
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,099
Well, we just dropped like two or three thousand frames five minutes ago.

627
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:13,500
So I'm not sure why we're having internet issues at the moment.

628
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,340
Well, maybe when your mother's finished mourning your father,

629
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:20,460
I'll keep her in black on your behalf.

630
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:22,619
You think on that point.

631
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,139
Well, maybe you shall, sir.

632
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:25,739
And maybe other events will transpire.

633
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,460
You best stick to them books because mark my words on this.

634
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,380
Vengeance is an idiot's game.

635
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,659
Ah, Mrs. Downs, thank you for your punctuality.

636
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,179
It's next to godliness, isn't it?

637
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,539
That's clean.

638
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:39,340
Lego Island.

639
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,780
I'll have to take your word on that.

640
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:43,079
Good day.

641
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,420
Yeah, I told you I was going to play Lego Island.

642
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,219
I was going to build a computer to play Lego Island.

643
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,340
I got a Raspberry Pi that you can't even install it on there.

644
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,659
I was going to just build a fucking computer.

645
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,010
You don't like my Arthur?

646
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,920
I think I just put random clothes on him.

647
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:35,469
Christmas dinner cooking stream.

648
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,030
Uh, no.

649
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:41,800
Ten.

650
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,719
Did I just get three grand?

651
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,719
Holy shit.

652
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,800
The camp just took ten thousand dollars from that.

653
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:56,250
I've been donating hundreds of dollars a week to the camp.

654
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:03,039
About you playing that zoo game.

655
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:03,599
I was.

656
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,840
And then after like four hours or so, it was.

657
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:10,719
We kind of saw the things that we wanted to see.

658
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,010
So I have to go do Mike and now, don't I?

659
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,369
I actually have to do this.

660
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,159
All right, let me see.

661
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:27,920
I think I have all the upgrades though, don't I?

662
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:33,230
I'm 95% certain that I have the upgrades.

663
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:41,500
Everyone's calling my name.

664
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:41,980
I'm busy.

665
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,019
I got places to be, man.

666
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:48,440
I'm going to eat some food.

667
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,519
This is a sexy Santa cosplay.

668
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:06,860
I didn't say that.

669
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,980
Somebody, I didn't say that.

670
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,699
Somebody said that.

671
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:09,500
Somebody else said that.

672
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:12,380
I was just responding to somebody in chat.

673
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:20,090
How are we all doing?

674
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:21,130
No, I don't play dominoes.

675
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:22,170
I don't know how to play dominoes.

676
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:33,280
So let's do some cleaning here.

677
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:35,869
Shave my face.

678
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:37,980
Maybe.

679
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,679
Just a little.

680
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:40,480
Maybe just a tad.

681
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:52,239
No, no, no.

682
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:55,929
Just give him a long chin.

683
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,159
No, I want to keep the whole thing.

684
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,320
How do I grow more hair?

685
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:08,880
Is there a way?

686
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:17,920
Is there a way for me just to have the beard go all the way to 10?

687
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,639
Hair tonic?

688
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:21,679
Just drink hair tonic?

689
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,090
No, you put hair tonic on.

690
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,289
You don't consume it.

691
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:32,329
Take some ammo.

692
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,960
You drink, yeah, I drink the tonic.

693
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:42,699
It stops you from getting hairy insides.

694
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,369
I've been doing it so wrong this whole time.

695
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:53,039
All right.

696
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,679
Micah, are you the last mission?

697
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:57,800
No, you know what?

698
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,679
No, fuck Micah.

699
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:07,179
Let's go do the other side mission thing.

700
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:21,869
Let's do it.

701
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:26,750
Let's go do this.

702
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,650
Where is it on the map here?

703
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:36,860
What the hell is it?

704
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,070
Was it even on the map?

705
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:41,710
Maybe it wasn't.

706
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:43,710
And I can donate this.

707
00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:49,480
I thought I had another mission to do.

708
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:49,960
I guess not.

709
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,880
I'll do it.

710
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,119
How long is the stream going to be?

711
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,159
Uh, maybe like another...

712
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:06,360
I'll do like one more mission and then we'll probably call it a night.

713
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm going to start fairly early, I think, tomorrow.

714
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,730
Because I want to get started with the online.

715
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,050
WWE, yeah, we'll do one match.

716
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:32,440
We'll do one match.

717
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,019
Dad lied to us.

718
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:36,219
No, I told you I'm going to do one.

719
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:36,940
I'll do one match.

720
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,539
Upgrade?

721
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:44,139
I have all the upgrades already.

722
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,079
Unless they changed.

723
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:52,909
Let me take a look.

724
00:53:58,329 --> 00:53:59,849
Make Arthur Morgan in WWE.

725
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:08,809
Yeah, I usually kill old dress schools too.

726
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,170
We ain't in the revenge business.

727
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,530
It don't keep you fed.

728
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:19,929
Just watch me.

729
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,409
Buy the mech suit upgrade.

730
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,989
$32 returned.

731
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,199
All right, let's take a look at the ledger.

732
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:34,239
I don't know if I...

733
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:43,179
Yeah, I can restock.

734
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,619
I'll restock.

735
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,320
Why not?

736
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,320
Uh, bought everything else.

737
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,960
Buy that.

738
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:58,989
Buy that.

739
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:02,429
I bought everything else.

740
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:04,349
I have the boat too.

741
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:09,900
I really needed that, didn't I?

742
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:17,000
Upgrade everything?

743
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,559
I already did.

744
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,139
Did you buy fast travel?

745
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:22,860
Uh, I think I do because I upgraded his tent, right?

746
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:26,539
Shave his head.

747
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:46,510
All right, let's go.

748
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,619
I'm gonna go do the mica mission

749
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:53,900
because it's there and I have to do it at some point.

750
00:55:54,539 --> 00:56:00,670
Might as well just get it done.

751
00:56:01,309 --> 00:56:06,809
We'll do the mica mission and then we'll do a...

752
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:09,130
We'll do a match.

753
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:14,349
We'll do another, like, backstage brawl in WWE.

754
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,289
I'm thinking about who I'd want to be.

755
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,059
Fast travel.

756
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:23,820
Do I have to go to his tent to fast travel?

757
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,559
What?

758
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,159
I didn't even pay attention to how to do that

759
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:31,840
because I didn't want to use it originally, so...

760
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,239
Let's see, where am I going here?

761
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,159
We're going to...

762
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:41,400
Strawberry.

763
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,800
It's behind his tent.

764
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,159
Okay.

765
00:56:52,429 --> 00:56:54,030
Well, where the hell is Dutch's...

766
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,510
This is the new area we've moved away, so...

767
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,599
Is it behind my tent or is it behind Dutch's tent?

768
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:08,940
In my tent.

769
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:22,110
Hmm, on the side?

770
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,469
It's the map on the side.

771
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:37,469
It's shaving kit, clothing change, fast travel.

772
00:57:37,469 --> 00:57:37,869
There it is.

773
00:57:38,909 --> 00:57:41,199
Well, apparently not anymore.

774
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:41,699
There we go.

775
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,280
All right, strawberry.

776
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,400
Does this cost money?

777
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:53,559
No, it doesn't.

778
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:54,909
That's cool.

779
00:57:56,030 --> 00:58:00,539
Goodbye.

780
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:19,840
That just costed me some sweet vista views.

781
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:29,789
Favorite member of Dutch's gang.

782
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:30,989
Uh, Jose is cool.

783
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:41,289
Fast travel, more like...

784
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:45,159
You know what I'm saying?

785
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,039
All right, Micah, let's go.

786
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:03,400
Don't make me regret this.

787
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:12,190
Every time you do a mission with Micah,

788
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,969
you get a $300 bounty somewhere.

789
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,260
That's why I've avoided it for so long.

790
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:20,829
I don't want to go do a bunch of shit and

791
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,619
get in a lot of trouble and have to pay somebody $300.

792
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:38,750
It's like down here.

793
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:47,159
Oh, there he is.

794
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,329
Arthur, what the fuck was that?

795
01:00:02,889 --> 01:00:20,030
All right, I need to refill one of these cubes.

796
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,710
Have another one.

797
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,510
All right, see?

798
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,150
Everything's fine.

799
01:00:33,789 --> 01:00:35,639
All right, Micah, what do you want?

800
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:36,119
What do you need?

801
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:36,760
What do you want me to do?

802
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,219
Let us begin.

803
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,039
Hey, Arthur.

804
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:47,239
Good to see you.

805
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:50,219
Why, you want rescuing again, do you?

806
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:51,980
No.

807
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,019
Why, is Arthur apologizing to the horse for feeding it to you?

808
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:58,940
I think he's apologizing for running the horse off the cliff and killing it.

809
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,780
Like you going off scouting and handing up in jail?

810
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,699
Dutch said you was a big shadow cast by a tiny tree.

811
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:08,219
I don't even know what that means.

812
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,460
I thought you was a tough boy.

813
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,900
Not one of those gentlemen trying to protect his riding clothes.

814
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,219
I just know whenever things get real,

815
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:20,139
you turn yellow and lose your head.

816
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:20,699
Yellow?

817
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:21,820
Sure seems that way.

818
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:25,019
So I guess you won't be riding with me to rob the banking coach.

819
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:31,820
I heard one of the old Driscoll boys yapping about it while I was inside.

820
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,940
You and me?

821
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,900
Do robbery?

822
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,659
That's what I said, didn't I?

823
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:37,019
Am I a tough boy?

824
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:37,260
No.

825
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,699
I'm a solid boy.

826
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:41,739
Come on.

827
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,880
Robbing another bank.

828
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:58,239
Can't exactly stay in town now, can I?

829
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,599
Like I told you, I ain't going back to Dutch

830
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,599
without a peace offering.

831
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,920
So what's the deal with this coach?

832
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,480
What do you mean?

833
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,599
Comes through about this time every day.

834
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,679
Like I said, if we were robbing a bank,

835
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:13,760
we'd be really far away from it right now.

836
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,559
How many men?

837
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:15,599
Guns.

838
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:15,840
Right.

839
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,480
I've been serious.

840
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,000
You'll be fine.

841
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,360
Banks been hiring every trigger man they can get of late.

842
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,639
The meaner, the better.

843
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:28,519
I'm afraid too much.

844
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:29,480
Compact and solid.

845
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:34,440
Forgive me if I ain't wholly faithful in something an old Driscoll told you.

846
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,760
When you was half drunk in a jail cell.

847
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,800
No, I'm not dense.

848
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,000
He kept yapping about it, saying how they've been hitting it on the regular.

849
01:02:41,719 --> 01:02:43,559
That's a good lead in my book.

850
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,599
It is a bank.

851
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:47,000
Damn old Trisculls are everywhere.

852
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,199
We're going to ride to a bank?

853
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:50,840
These bastards got ahold of most of Big Valley.

854
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,719
Heard they took over some big ranch north of here.

855
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,199
I'm going to play Just Cause 4 when it comes out.

856
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:58,039
How the hell do you know how many end up down here anyway?

857
01:02:58,039 --> 01:02:58,599
I never played Just Cause 3.

858
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:00,199
Do you know how it is?

859
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:01,239
Do you lose sense?

860
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:01,719
No, did I?

861
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:03,480
Drink there?

862
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,840
I think I played, maybe I did play Just Cause 3 for like a day on the multiplayer.

863
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,199
Nothing that needs to concern you.

864
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:09,480
I always pay my share.

865
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:15,480
It concerns me when you put us in danger and we don't realize till it's too late.

866
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,199
Like that move you pulled at Strawberry.

867
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:19,960
Just dance.

868
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,760
Just for your precious guns.

869
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,000
No, you'll never see a Just Dance stream for me.

870
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,840
You need to roll a little looser, Morgan.

871
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,119
Looser?

872
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:32,909
I've seen you come full on more than once now.

873
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,829
The only way you'd ever get a Just Dance stream for me?

874
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:40,989
Is if I hired like 30 dancers to dance behind me while we were all in the same costumes.

875
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:51,360
Do it.

876
01:03:51,360 --> 01:04:02,329
Do it one day.

877
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:04,039
Just do it now.

878
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,559
Be right back.

879
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,659
See you guys in like 15 minutes.

880
01:04:18,429 --> 01:04:19,469
Here's the spot.

881
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:20,349
Hold up on the bridge.

882
01:04:20,349 --> 01:04:20,909
You got it.

883
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,739
Should be from over there.

884
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:37,980
Doesn't Micah look like he's wearing a rubber mask and over the rubber mask?

885
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:40,059
Fake hair.

886
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:41,980
Fake mustache, fake beard, fake hair.

887
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:56,219
Let's go.

888
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,519
There's that music.

889
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:03,119
Attack the guards and stop the stagecoach.

890
01:05:06,989 --> 01:05:20,170
Bingo.

891
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,880
Oh, did I get them all?

892
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:34,239
Just leave one guy left, right?

893
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,940
More.

894
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,500
See you later.

895
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:44,480
Oh, sedazy.

896
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:49,599
Got him.

897
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,679
I shot him right in the tailbone.

898
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,010
Are you playing Red Dead Online?

899
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:02,889
You'll see it tomorrow.

900
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,380
I feel like it's gonna be wild.

901
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:10,860
Wait, I don't get to drive?

902
01:06:11,659 --> 01:06:15,639
I gotta keep the horses with us.

903
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,119
Come on, horse.

904
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:16,440
Let's go.

905
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,059
Hat in the wagon.

906
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:30,079
Yeah, the hat's fine.

907
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:39,760
Maybe it'll fall off.

908
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:49,869
Take the hat.

909
01:06:49,869 --> 01:06:50,510
Take the hat.

910
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:50,989
I'll get the hat.

911
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,739
It's too tense.

912
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:04,539
I can't stand it.

913
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,420
What if the hat falls?

914
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,000
I'm gonna get that hat.

915
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:33,639
No, the mission's gonna fail.

916
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:35,880
The mission's gonna fail.

917
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,760
I don't want to sit through that.

918
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,559
I don't want to hear him talk.

919
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,239
I hate this character.

920
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:45,320
Forget about the hat.

921
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,440
It's gone.

922
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:46,920
Forever.

923
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,760
Garbage stream.

924
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,199
He lost the hat on purpose.

925
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:13,199
How much did you pay for Red Dead?

926
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:14,480
I did the wrong thing.

927
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,140
I paid the middle of the road

928
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,579
special edition, which is

929
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:24,220
you just get a cool horse.

930
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,340
You don't get to participate

931
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,779
in the beta that happened today.

932
01:08:26,779 --> 01:08:27,979
Well, I will tomorrow.

933
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:30,619
But I bought the one

934
01:08:30,619 --> 01:08:31,579
that you shouldn't have bought.

935
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,109
Where's the QTE?

936
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:44,060
When is movie night?

937
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:44,939
Movie night is Sunday.

938
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:46,060
This weekend.

939
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:58,010
There we go.

940
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:58,489
Watch this.

941
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,140
One, two, three.

942
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:03,439
Activate!

943
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,260
Oh, I didn't have enough deadeye.

944
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:07,819
Oh my god.

945
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:08,619
That's a mistake.

946
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:18,619
I need deadeye.

947
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:19,819
Let's bring Tom.

948
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:34,220
No, that's not the guy.

949
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:41,689
Banjo-Kazooie music.

950
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,439
Why is that making me laugh so much?

951
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:09,359
When is movie night happening?

952
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:09,920
Give it a...

953
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,399
Oh, Sunday.

954
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:10,899
This Sunday.

955
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,279
It's Sunday night.

956
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,720
Did I...

957
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,220
Did I not?

958
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:22,619
Maybe I didn't finish my sentence.

959
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:24,619
All right.

960
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:25,180
Okay.

961
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:25,979
Well, we got more.

962
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:33,520
People are here.

963
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,359
So, how many...

964
01:10:38,649 --> 01:10:40,439
Is it deadeye or not?

965
01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:46,600
Um, no idea.

966
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:54,300
Dark Souls are the light, though.

967
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:54,800
Tom.

968
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:01,500
What day of the week is Sunday?

969
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,979
It's the one that comes after Saturday and before Monday.

970
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:11,819
Sunday p.m.

971
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:15,579
Yeah, Sunday raspberry p.m.

972
01:11:22,619 --> 01:11:23,119
Got it!

973
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:29,800
Do online?

974
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,680
I can't do online.

975
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:33,159
I did not buy the Ultimate Edition.

976
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:35,479
I have to wait till tomorrow.

977
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:37,960
So, I'm just kind of getting familiar with the video game again.

978
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,560
So, then I'm prepared tomorrow and I know what I'm doing.

979
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,279
And like I said.

980
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:53,319
Fucking mask.

981
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:54,680
Rubber mask.

982
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,000
With a goddamn fake mustache on it.

983
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:00,600
I'll pull that off sooner or later, Micah.

984
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,880
We'll see who you really are.

985
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:05,149
Six hundred bucks.

986
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:05,550
Three hundred.

987
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:06,109
That's pretty good.

988
01:12:06,109 --> 01:12:07,069
Three hundred and thirty dollars.

989
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:19,640
Ultimate Edition.

990
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,239
No, the only Ultimate Edition I bought was Zoo Tycoon 2.

991
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:26,989
All right.

992
01:12:26,989 --> 01:12:27,550
Well, there you go.

993
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,279
Hey, there you go.

994
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,079
Where...

995
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,359
I think I was gonna go like this.

996
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,319
And it was with the money, too.

997
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:43,039
What do you mean the money?

998
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:50,329
I was trying to...

999
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:51,529
I'm trying to launch myself.

1000
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:57,500
I'm trying to do a springboard.

1001
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,100
Shoot out of the cannon into the water and move.

1002
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:07,020
It's not gonna happen, is it?

1003
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,819
If it was online, you'd get four dollars and four cents.

1004
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:19,680
You need to be going faster, though.

1005
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:20,800
All right.

1006
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,680
So, I'm good with...

1007
01:13:29,149 --> 01:13:35,630
Did you just shoot me off?

1008
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,170
You have mere seconds to live.

1009
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:56,569
Whoa.

1010
01:13:56,569 --> 01:13:58,569
Crazy Red Dead 2 moments.

1011
01:13:59,529 --> 01:14:05,630
Okay.

1012
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:07,149
So, we're gonna not all save here.

1013
01:14:07,149 --> 01:14:07,710
So, we're good.

1014
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:13,340
Let's go do Adam Sandler versus Adam Sandler in a backstage brawl.

1015
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:18,779
That's not what I'm doing, by the way.

1016
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:28,220
So many games tonight.

1017
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,739
Yeah, I'm just kind of dicking around.

1018
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:32,060
I was hoping I could play the online.

1019
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,420
That was the plan that I found out

1020
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,260
that I wasn't gonna be able to play it.

1021
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:38,840
So, just hanging out tonight.

1022
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,920
And we're gonna be going tomorrow, too.

1023
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:41,479
So, don't worry.

1024
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:43,920
I had fun tonight, though.

1025
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:48,439
Zoo Tycoon was really interesting for the first like, you know, three or four hours.

1026
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:58,199
So, let's get this changed.

1027
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,170
We don't really...

1028
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:02,170
I don't even really change the title.

1029
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:02,810
I don't think...

1030
01:15:10,909 --> 01:15:11,470
Wait, what?

1031
01:15:12,189 --> 01:15:19,880
Wait a minute.

1032
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:36,520
What the fuck is happening?

1033
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:53,119
I have this on PC.

1034
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:54,560
That's why it's like that.

1035
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,729
Why do I have this on PS4?

1036
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:01,369
What happened?

1037
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:01,609
What?

1038
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:04,279
Oh, fuck.

1039
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:05,960
Okay, I know what happened.

1040
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:10,090
I bought the game twice.

1041
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:20,270
Like, between...

1042
01:16:20,989 --> 01:16:22,350
From probably a while ago.

1043
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,229
When did I buy this?

1044
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,199
How long?

1045
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,000
Am I crazy?

1046
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,010
That's why there was a random...

1047
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:42,140
That was gonna be Beanbag Sonic from whenever the fuck I started it.

1048
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:42,859
I must have gone...

1049
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:44,060
Oh, wait, there's a PC version.

1050
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,100
Fuck, isn't there?

1051
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,579
And I bought...

1052
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:45,819
Yeah.

1053
01:16:46,829 --> 01:16:47,470
Well, okay.

1054
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,239
All right.

1055
01:16:55,869 --> 01:16:56,989
I bought it twice.

1056
01:16:57,710 --> 01:17:03,520
Now, let's open the real one.

1057
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,079
The one that has the fucking 40 characters on it.

1058
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,199
I can't believe I didn't like...

1059
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:14,359
It did not deserve to be bought twice.

1060
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:14,920
I was just...

1061
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,520
My brain just did not comprehend what was just going on right there.

1062
01:17:25,369 --> 01:17:26,010
Yeah.

1063
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:27,369
So, like six...

1064
01:17:27,369 --> 01:17:28,890
Yeah, like probably seven days ago.

1065
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:29,609
Eight days ago.

1066
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:33,289
I bought it on PS4 because I didn't think it was on PC.

1067
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:37,390
And then I realized it was on PC.

1068
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,829
I started making somebody.

1069
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:48,600
Yeah, I'll take off the delay thing.

1070
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:55,079
You don't remember eight days ago?

1071
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:56,119
Well, no, I do.

1072
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:57,800
I remember buying it, but I don't remember when.

1073
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
The timeline is not in my brain

1074
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,079
because I spent so much time in the PC one.

1075
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:07,479
This guy buys games and forgets.

1076
01:18:08,359 --> 01:18:13,739
I forgot to like fucking...

1077
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:14,220
I don't think you can...

1078
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,539
You can't even refund a game on PS4, can you?

1079
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:19,310
If you download it digitally?

1080
01:18:19,869 --> 01:18:30,890
All right, let's open up the real one.

1081
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:31,850
Here it is.

1082
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:37,770
I was wondering why that was fucking stupid.

1083
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:38,810
All right.

1084
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:43,319
Here it comes.

1085
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:47,800
And I...

1086
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,840
And this one was like 50% off on Steam.

1087
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:56,640
That's the worst part.

1088
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,560
And I just hurt myself in my ears.

1089
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:17,069
I'm really sorry that happened, everybody.

1090
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,199
The outro is playing.

1091
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,579
Hey, look, that guy's dabbing.

1092
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:37,279
Okay, let's go to play here.

1093
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,229
Here you go.

1094
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:42,590
Let's do backstage brawl.

1095
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:44,909
Here's the match we're going to do.

1096
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,479
Really, game?

1097
01:19:59,479 --> 01:19:59,880
You can't...

1098
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:11,159
No duplicates.

1099
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:16,880
I got an idea.

1100
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,359
How about we do...

1101
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:21,399
Oh, that's right.

1102
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:22,439
I forgot we made him too.

1103
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:23,000
All right, let's do...

1104
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,199
Let's do the two actors.

1105
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:32,569
Oh, no.

1106
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:35,390
Willem Dafoe versus the Nintendo Labo.

1107
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:36,510
Sounds right to me.

1108
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,069
Let's do it.

1109
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:43,310
He's really good.

1110
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:43,630
He is.

1111
01:20:44,189 --> 01:20:56,829
Not even going to wait.

1112
01:20:56,829 --> 01:20:57,550
Spun him around.

1113
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:57,949
I've yet...

1114
01:20:57,949 --> 01:20:58,670
Where's the punch?

1115
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,229
Talking shit in his face.

1116
01:21:02,109 --> 01:21:05,420
At least it's even.

1117
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:10,060
The Labo is just a Minecraft character.

1118
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:16,279
Kick his ass, Dafoe.

1119
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:24,960
Everybody ends it instantly.

1120
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,399
I would laugh by myself.

1121
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:31,119
But I've been Red Dead.

1122
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,960
The stream is pretty much over.

1123
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,159
I'm just doing this for fun.

1124
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:40,560
Dude, even me versus the Labo.

1125
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,369
Come on, bend him.

1126
01:21:45,369 --> 01:21:46,329
Fold him.

1127
01:21:46,329 --> 01:21:51,439
This is how I treat my Labo creations.

1128
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:52,720
I mean, not completely...

1129
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,560
Not completely untrue.

1130
01:21:55,279 --> 01:22:00,359
You can't lift him.

1131
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:06,859
The stock sound effects really are so stupid.

1132
01:22:07,579 --> 01:22:12,590
So how does this end?

1133
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,300
I'm thinking Labo is going to go through a table.

1134
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:23,659
Going to the locker room.

1135
01:22:23,659 --> 01:22:26,619
Don't just fight out here next to the sound equipment.

1136
01:22:38,859 --> 01:22:41,180
They keep doing the throw him into the wall thing.

1137
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:43,949
There we go.

1138
01:22:43,949 --> 01:22:44,989
Into the locker room.

1139
01:22:44,989 --> 01:22:45,949
Make something happen here.

1140
01:22:59,039 --> 01:22:59,600
Jesus.

1141
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:03,560
That could end really quickly.

1142
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:09,279
I love how that's just a big giant...

1143
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:10,699
He's going to kill him.

1144
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:14,640
There's just a cartoon trash can in here.

1145
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:25,500
Get back in there.

1146
01:23:26,779 --> 01:23:28,510
His head's too big.

1147
01:23:29,149 --> 01:23:30,109
His head is too big.

1148
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:35,869
Just let him go.

1149
01:23:35,869 --> 01:23:36,430
That's it?

1150
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:38,350
You just let him go.

1151
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:43,720
He picked him up and dropped him.

1152
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:58,279
That's going to be it.

1153
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,810
That was fucking stupid.

1154
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,199
No, I don't want to...

1155
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:07,399
If I'm going to do wrestling stuff,

1156
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:11,229
I want it to be something that I think about

1157
01:24:11,229 --> 01:24:12,189
and well thought out.

1158
01:24:12,189 --> 01:24:13,310
Not just random matches.

1159
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:14,750
Maybe someday.

1160
01:24:17,149 --> 01:24:18,350
Create Super Sandler.

1161
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:21,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1162
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,560
Not tonight.

1163
01:24:22,119 --> 01:24:28,489
I might increase the frequency that we do stuff like this,

1164
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,890
but not so much where it happens all the time.

1165
01:24:33,449 --> 01:24:41,710
But anyways, that's going to be it for tonight.

1166
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:43,390
Thank you for sticking around.

1167
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:46,989
A little bit of a just chill stream.

1168
01:24:46,989 --> 01:24:47,229
We...

1169
01:24:48,699 --> 01:24:48,939
We...

1170
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:50,539
Something in my throat.

1171
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,840
Played a couple of games.

1172
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,670
Thanks for joining me.

1173
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:58,970
And we'll do the bits

1174
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,810
and we'll do the credits at the end.

1175
01:25:01,609 --> 01:25:04,170
See you guys tomorrow for Red Dead Multiplayer.

1176
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:08,569
I'm not going to start as late as I did today.

1177
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:11,069
I will be starting at probably...

1178
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:15,550
An hour or two before.

1179
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:17,310
So somewhere around...

1180
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:22,279
Probably like five or six Eastern.

1181
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,090
I'd like to start.

1182
01:25:26,859 --> 01:25:29,659
I'm not going to finish the main story in Red Dead tomorrow.

1183
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,180
Oh, I don't know.

1184
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:32,699
Maybe if Multiplayer...

1185
01:25:33,579 --> 01:25:35,020
Do Multiplayer for a few hours.

1186
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:35,739
See how it goes.

1187
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:36,539
If I'm still having fun,

1188
01:25:36,539 --> 01:25:37,500
maybe I'll just transition

1189
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,619
and just keep going in Red Dead.

1190
01:25:38,619 --> 01:25:39,180
I don't know.

1191
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:39,579
We'll see.

1192
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:43,710
Did you miss the green screen movie night?

1193
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,189
You did not.

1194
01:25:44,189 --> 01:25:44,829
That is Sunday.

1195
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,800
Sunday night.

1196
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:53,960
So with that, let's go back.

1197
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:58,829
Just about six hours ago now.

1198
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,359
It's really a six hour stream.

1199
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,949
I thought it was a little shorter than that,

1200
01:26:07,949 --> 01:26:10,939
but I guess not.

1201
01:26:10,939 --> 01:26:14,220
So starting here with Peter.

1202
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:16,060
Thank you, Peter, for the $3.33.

1203
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:16,699
Cool guy.

1204
01:26:16,699 --> 01:26:17,260
Thank you, Peter.

1205
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:19,130
Do test.

1206
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:19,850
Thanks for the $1.

1207
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:20,810
Parts.

1208
01:26:21,369 --> 01:26:22,619
Appreciate it.

1209
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:24,880
Nostalgic Nerd.

1210
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,760
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

1211
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,119
Hey, Durban, wanted to sincerely thank you

1212
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:29,279
for all the hard and amazing work you do on these streams.

1213
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:31,840
You helped me get through some rough times in high school

1214
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,079
and the death of my great uncle.

1215
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:35,680
I can never fully repay you for what you've done

1216
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:38,409
for me, but this is a start.

1217
01:26:38,409 --> 01:26:39,850
Thanks, fellow New Englander.

1218
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:42,920
Thank you, Nostalgic Nerd.

1219
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:47,119
Yeah, the music is not on.

1220
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:47,840
That's correct.

1221
01:26:49,689 --> 01:26:51,689
I'm sorry to hear about your loss.

1222
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,989
There is no repaying me,

1223
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:58,829
so don't worry about that.

1224
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:02,539
Thank you for the $10 regardless,

1225
01:27:02,539 --> 01:27:06,010
but you don't have to pay me money

1226
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:08,079
because you think that you owe it.

1227
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:09,039
You don't.

1228
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:10,159
So thank you, though.

1229
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,279
And fellow New Englander.

1230
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:14,350
Yeah, New England's great.

1231
01:27:14,909 --> 01:27:16,840
I'm in Las Vegas at the moment, though.

1232
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:23,439
Not sure where I'll be in the next couple of years.

1233
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:23,920
I don't know.

1234
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,279
Depends on how much I like it here.

1235
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,159
I'm up in the air right now,

1236
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:33,159
but thank you, Nostalgic Nerd, for the $10

1237
01:27:33,159 --> 01:27:34,119
and that wonderful message.

1238
01:27:34,119 --> 01:27:34,619
Thank you.

1239
01:27:36,899 --> 01:27:39,300
Thank you, Spartanese, for the $1.

1240
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:41,500
Thank you, Enamelint.

1241
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:44,220
Enamelint for the $10.

1242
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,460
Thanks to the stream, German.

1243
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,180
It's been a rough day,

1244
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:49,020
but your streams never fail to cheer me up.

1245
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:50,060
Cheer my heart.

1246
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:53,859
Thank you so much, Enamelint.

1247
01:27:53,859 --> 01:27:58,659
Thank you for the $10.

1248
01:27:59,539 --> 01:28:01,279
Sorry to hear about your days

1249
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:02,319
and how it's been going so well.

1250
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,989
Hopefully tomorrow's better.

1251
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:06,760
Thank you.

1252
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,920
Kumutosen.

1253
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,380
Thanks for the $10, Kumutosen.

1254
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,180
10 bucks.

1255
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,539
$10 three times in a row here, guys.

1256
01:28:15,539 --> 01:28:16,340
Thank you.

1257
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,699
Hey, German, it's my birthday today.

1258
01:28:18,659 --> 01:28:19,460
Thank you for all the laughs.

1259
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,420
I've been incredibly depressed

1260
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,539
for the past while,

1261
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:22,420
and your videos and streams

1262
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:23,380
have helped cheer me up.

1263
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,220
There's a small token of my appreciation.

1264
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,750
Keep up the good work.

1265
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:30,399
You're really doing a lot of good.

1266
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:32,000
Well, happy birthday.

1267
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,119
Hopefully it's still your birthday

1268
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:34,239
because that was a while ago,

1269
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,840
and if it's past your birthday,

1270
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,529
happy second birthday,

1271
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:40,159
which is tomorrow,

1272
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:42,079
which is today for you, potentially,

1273
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:45,180
depending on where you are in the world.

1274
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,060
But thank you so much.

1275
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:46,779
Happy birthday.

1276
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:50,319
Sorry to hear about

1277
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:54,800
that you've been feeling bad.

1278
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,520
If you're having fun,

1279
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,239
that makes me happy.

1280
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:57,279
So thank you.

1281
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:03,390
It's a double birthday.

1282
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,460
Thank you, Spartanis, again for the $1.

1283
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:09,569
Spartanis again.

1284
01:29:09,569 --> 01:29:12,050
Spartanis gave one, two, three, four, five.

1285
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,489
Five dollars here.

1286
01:29:13,489 --> 01:29:15,550
We're almost six dollars here.

1287
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:18,579
No message, just dropping bits.

1288
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:18,979
Thank you.

1289
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:22,130
Dog memes.

1290
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:24,239
Thanks for the $10.

1291
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,359
Dog memes.

1292
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:27,539
Hey, German, memes aside,

1293
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:29,220
I've been watching you since the TF2 days.

1294
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:33,489
Six years later,

1295
01:29:33,489 --> 01:29:34,859
and you're still going strong.

1296
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:35,579
Here's some money.

1297
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:36,619
Spend it on whatever you want.

1298
01:29:36,619 --> 01:29:37,739
Thanks for being a cool guy.

1299
01:29:41,789 --> 01:29:42,109
Thank you.

1300
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:44,829
Thank you for being nice enough to

1301
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,180
pay money to somebody on the internet.

1302
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:51,390
You know what I mean?

1303
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:53,699
All of you.

1304
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,859
Six years ago.

1305
01:29:58,859 --> 01:29:59,659
That's so long.

1306
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:02,079
Can you imagine?

1307
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:04,479
Fast forward like a few years.

1308
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:06,640
Like, oh yeah, I've been watching you

1309
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:07,119
for 10 years.

1310
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:08,640
Oh, 10 years ago when I started.

1311
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,300
Who knows?

1312
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:19,140
I can't even fathom saying those words.

1313
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:23,899
Because right now it's about six and a half to seven.

1314
01:30:23,899 --> 01:30:25,539
Yeah.

1315
01:30:25,539 --> 01:30:26,500
Another few years,

1316
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,539
and it's going to be a decade.

1317
01:30:31,229 --> 01:30:31,949
That's crazy.

1318
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:36,109
At that point,

1319
01:30:36,109 --> 01:30:38,109
that's a significant portion of my entire life.

1320
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,630
Will have been doing this.

1321
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:43,710
On YouTube, on Twitch,

1322
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:45,470
or wherever and whatever I end up doing.

1323
01:30:47,819 --> 01:30:48,300
We'll see.

1324
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,739
I don't give myself a time limit,

1325
01:30:49,739 --> 01:30:50,939
but I don't give myself a

1326
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:53,659
amount of time that I have to do it.

1327
01:30:53,659 --> 01:30:56,979
It's not like, oh yeah,

1328
01:30:56,979 --> 01:30:58,340
well, you know, in 20 years

1329
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:02,180
when I'm still streaming on German 985 Twitch.

1330
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:02,819
I don't know.

1331
01:31:02,819 --> 01:31:06,319
It's very significant already, though.

1332
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:06,640
It's true.

1333
01:31:12,289 --> 01:31:13,170
But thank you, Dom.

1334
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:14,529
Dog memes.

1335
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:16,239
Appreciate it.

1336
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:18,779
Gentle ghosts.

1337
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:19,659
Thanks for the five dollars.

1338
01:31:19,659 --> 01:31:22,060
Hey, German, my friend Warren,

1339
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,630
who is also a big fan of yours,

1340
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:25,229
is turning 18 this week.

1341
01:31:25,789 --> 01:31:27,869
I was wondering if you could wish him a happy birthday.

1342
01:31:27,869 --> 01:31:29,550
You've been watching your content with me

1343
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:30,270
for the past few years,

1344
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:31,470
and I'm sure you'll mean a lot to him.

1345
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:31,789
Thanks.

1346
01:31:32,899 --> 01:31:33,140
Yeah.

1347
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:34,739
Happy birthday, Warren.

1348
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:38,289
18.

1349
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:43,329
Significant milestone.

1350
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:44,930
That's the, you're an adult.

1351
01:31:45,489 --> 01:31:50,340
Except I didn't really become an adult

1352
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:52,180
until I was probably like 26.

1353
01:31:54,699 --> 01:31:59,920
So sing him the rat song.

1354
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,619
A lot of birthdays, huh?

1355
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:04,220
This week?

1356
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:04,699
Today?

1357
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:05,180
Tomorrow?

1358
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:13,710
Thank you, gentle ghosts.

1359
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:15,869
And again, happy birthday to Warren.

1360
01:32:15,869 --> 01:32:16,590
Thanks for watching.

1361
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:24,340
You guys rock.

1362
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:24,739
Thank you.

1363
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:26,020
Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar.

1364
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,619
I was rewatching you play Mario Tennis

1365
01:32:27,619 --> 01:32:28,899
and you mentioned a music stream.

1366
01:32:29,539 --> 01:32:30,659
Has that been canceled?

1367
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,659
Looking forward to the green screen.

1368
01:32:32,659 --> 01:32:33,060
Movie night.

1369
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,260
I'm currently working on a submission.

1370
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,380
Hopefully it will be done in time.

1371
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:35,859
Take care.

1372
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:42,779
I haven't, like, I don't cancel.

1373
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:44,640
Ideas.

1374
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:46,699
It took a long time.

1375
01:32:46,699 --> 01:32:48,220
Think about this, right?

1376
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,659
The detective stream.

1377
01:32:49,659 --> 01:32:52,619
The green screen stream.

1378
01:32:52,619 --> 01:32:55,729
Think of how long it took to actually get that done.

1379
01:32:57,869 --> 01:33:00,350
So it's not like it ever goes away completely.

1380
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:04,180
That green screen stream was mentioned

1381
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,380
more than three or four months ago.

1382
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,390
And then, you know, when they happen, they happen.

1383
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:16,909
Kind of have to be in the right mindset.

1384
01:33:16,909 --> 01:33:17,710
Time has to be right.

1385
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:19,149
I have to get the right resources ready

1386
01:33:21,699 --> 01:33:22,979
and try to get it done, you know?

1387
01:33:26,609 --> 01:33:27,890
The detective stream was also,

1388
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,090
that took a while to do as well.

1389
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:32,539
God, I want to do that again.

1390
01:33:32,539 --> 01:33:34,060
But, like, more elaborate.

1391
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:37,180
I have no idea.

1392
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:39,260
I got to think of some stupid ideas for that one.

1393
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:41,979
But thank you, Dr. Clay.

1394
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:44,979
No, nothing is ever, ever canceled.

1395
01:33:45,539 --> 01:33:47,390
They just get moved around.

1396
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:51,979
Hey, DivUSP.

1397
01:33:51,979 --> 01:33:53,100
I'm just kidding.

1398
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:56,029
Thank you, Divus, for the three dollars.

1399
01:33:56,029 --> 01:33:57,710
DivusP for the three bucks.

1400
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:03,170
Appreciate it.

1401
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:03,569
No message.

1402
01:34:03,569 --> 01:34:07,020
Thank you for the three dollars.

1403
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:08,619
Fisherman friend zone.

1404
01:34:08,619 --> 01:34:10,779
Thanks for the one dollar.

1405
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:12,300
My first experience.

1406
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,260
My first Jerma experience was in the video

1407
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:17,789
Ruiner of Fun, a.k.a.

1408
01:34:17,789 --> 01:34:18,829
Jerma's Mad Part 1.

1409
01:34:18,829 --> 01:34:21,359
I've been a fan ever since.

1410
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:23,520
Also, can you do the Neelix voice, please?

1411
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:25,579
Why?

1412
01:34:26,899 --> 01:34:28,739
I just can't believe.

1413
01:34:28,739 --> 01:34:32,579
I'm dressing up as Neelix for Halloween next year.

1414
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,819
And everyone's going to hate my guts.

1415
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:38,560
Hey, Elizabeth.

1416
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,520
Thanks for the one dollar.

1417
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,880
Show this on stream.

1418
01:34:43,579 --> 01:34:46,000
Well, first of all, let me see what it is.

1419
01:34:46,640 --> 01:35:01,329
Wait, what?

1420
01:35:16,189 --> 01:35:17,310
Don't get into that shit.

1421
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:19,310
Don't do that shit.

1422
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:26,180
What?

1423
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:26,899
What's wrong with that?

1424
01:35:27,619 --> 01:35:29,409
What's wrong with that?

1425
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,760
Go to bed.

1426
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,520
Yeah, like go to bed.

1427
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,079
Like you don't have to do anything crazy.

1428
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:50,670
Streamer promoting the use of drugs.

1429
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:51,149
No, I didn't.

1430
01:35:52,449 --> 01:35:54,050
I said, if you want to do that,

1431
01:35:54,609 --> 01:35:56,130
if you want to do that,

1432
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:58,609
then this is what I wouldn't be doing that.

1433
01:35:58,609 --> 01:36:00,529
And I would never condone.

1434
01:36:00,529 --> 01:36:01,329
Actually, I would.

1435
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:07,250
I don't smoke marijuana,

1436
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:09,939
but I don't smoke weed or anything.

1437
01:36:11,859 --> 01:36:13,699
But I do recognize its benefits.

1438
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:18,220
You probably think I'm just,

1439
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:19,979
oh, he's probably like high every stream.

1440
01:36:19,979 --> 01:36:20,859
Did you hear what he said?

1441
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:21,819
What the fuck?

1442
01:36:22,539 --> 01:36:23,899
She's definitely high.

1443
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:25,779
Really?

1444
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:28,739
You ever like see somebody high on fucking marijuana before?

1445
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,670
They don't talk about like,

1446
01:36:31,229 --> 01:36:32,850
they don't talk about like their,

1447
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:33,890
like their dreams.

1448
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:34,369
Yeah, they do.

1449
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:39,170
They don't talk about like checking asses.

1450
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:39,649
Yeah, they do.

1451
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:41,489
Point stands.

1452
01:36:50,989 --> 01:36:52,800
They don't talk about Garfield.

1453
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:53,439
Yes, they do.

1454
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:56,979
Doesn't matter.

1455
01:36:56,979 --> 01:37:00,739
If whatever you're doing is legal,

1456
01:37:00,739 --> 01:37:01,699
and you're all right,

1457
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:02,420
and you're safe,

1458
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:03,460
and you're being responsible,

1459
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,569
whatever.

1460
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:06,930
Think I got a problem with it?

1461
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:19,500
But thank you, Elizabeth, for the $1.

1462
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,939
Thank you, sly161 for the $1.

1463
01:37:20,939 --> 01:37:22,060
Hey, Jerma, I'm in the middle of class.

1464
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,739
Can you please pause the stream for two hours?

1465
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,319
I can't do that.

1466
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:27,359
I can't do that.

1467
01:37:31,579 --> 01:37:34,939
Thank you, Yeetee, in Yeetee,

1468
01:37:35,739 --> 01:37:38,220
tweet in Deetee for the $2.

1469
01:37:39,699 --> 01:37:40,100
Thank you.

1470
01:37:40,739 --> 01:37:47,600
Uh, is it cut tag or Q cut tag?

1471
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,960
Thanks for the $4.

1472
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,630
How'd, how do you donate?

1473
01:37:52,189 --> 01:37:57,140
You figured it out, I think.

1474
01:37:57,699 --> 01:38:01,069
Looks like you got it.

1475
01:38:01,069 --> 01:38:04,270
Thank you for the $4.

1476
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:06,319
Appreciate it.

1477
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:09,199
Uh, Dorosophilia, thanks for the $1.

1478
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:11,199
Hey, man, I couldn't find the donate button.

1479
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,279
This streamer doesn't have any on-screen text

1480
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:14,720
or information in the stream title

1481
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,600
telling me how to donate.

1482
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:17,439
So I didn't know what else to do.

1483
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:18,880
Pretty unprofessional, if you ask me.

1484
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,199
Would you kindly pass along my money to him?

1485
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:21,680
Yeah, sure.

1486
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:23,520
Oh, that's from what it was, okay.

1487
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,489
Thank you, Dorosophilia.

1488
01:38:33,489 --> 01:38:38,670
Thank you, uh, thank you, Dylan C for $3.

1489
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:42,340
Thank you for $5.

1490
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:44,420
I've been a fan of yours since the seventh grade.

1491
01:38:44,979 --> 01:38:47,460
Your YouTube videos and streams

1492
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,500
always give me a good laugh.

1493
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:52,909
They have also helped me through rough times

1494
01:38:52,909 --> 01:38:54,510
such as stressful days at college

1495
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:59,229
for after I run a,

1496
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:04,340
after there was a fire call to the fire department.

1497
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,140
I volunteer.

1498
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:07,869
Uh, I know it's not much,

1499
01:39:07,869 --> 01:39:09,630
but thanks for the fun times.

1500
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,579
Or after I run a nasty fire call.

1501
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:16,699
I see.

1502
01:39:16,699 --> 01:39:17,340
It's not much,

1503
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:18,779
but thank you for all the fun times.

1504
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:21,329
Don't worry about it.

1505
01:39:21,329 --> 01:39:22,609
Thank you for the $5.

1506
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:33,170
Doesn't matter if you give $1, $5, $10.

1507
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:36,050
Don't ever, ever feel like it's something

1508
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:40,609
that you need to be sorry about.

1509
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,449
Oh, sorry, sorry.

1510
01:39:42,449 --> 01:39:43,729
I'm only going to give you $5.

1511
01:39:43,729 --> 01:39:44,449
It's not much.

1512
01:39:44,449 --> 01:39:45,010
Yes, it is.

1513
01:39:47,539 --> 01:39:47,939
It is.

1514
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,409
Just the fact that you decided to

1515
01:39:51,409 --> 01:39:51,970
in the first place.

1516
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:52,850
Don't worry.

1517
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:59,119
I don't want anyone to ever have to apologize

1518
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:04,350
for giving me your money.

1519
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,569
You know what I'm saying?

1520
01:40:06,779 --> 01:40:08,859
Thank you for even considering.

1521
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:16,619
Much love to you.

1522
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:17,500
Thanks for the $5.

1523
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:19,680
Super seal.

1524
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,720
Thanks for the $1.

1525
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,000
There's an image.

1526
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,880
Let's see what it is.

1527
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:34,510
It is of, uh, what the fuck?

1528
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:44,979
Well, that's not terrifying at all.

1529
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:46,340
Thank you.

1530
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,859
Super seal for the ice cream.

1531
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:49,859
I guess.

1532
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:52,399
Thank you.

1533
01:40:53,739 --> 01:40:54,380
Frody and weapon.

1534
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:55,500
Thanks for the $1.

1535
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:55,979
No message.

1536
01:40:55,979 --> 01:40:56,380
Thank you.

1537
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:57,180
Palette of produce.

1538
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:58,619
Thanks for the $15.

1539
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:00,880
Palette of produce.

1540
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,060
No message from Palette here,

1541
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,020
but thank you so much.

1542
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:05,859
For you 15 bucks.

1543
01:41:07,779 --> 01:41:08,739
That's a new emote.

1544
01:41:08,739 --> 01:41:09,220
Oh, God.

1545
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:12,800
Extra cheesy.

1546
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,359
Thanks for the $1.

1547
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,859
Why are the beavers living in raw sewage?

1548
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:17,979
No, that was a habitat that was

1549
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:19,500
created with craft and care.

1550
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,619
And I made sure to make it as comfortable as I could.

1551
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,460
They had, they had a good life.

1552
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:30,640
Snooze and copter.

1553
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,520
Thanks for the $1.

1554
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:38,560
It is a, I've actually seen a couple pieces of art for this.

1555
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,119
This is awesome.

1556
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:41,119
Thank you, snoozing copter.

1557
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,300
Super Jax and the blue screen of death.

1558
01:41:49,859 --> 01:41:50,420
That's great.

1559
01:41:54,699 --> 01:41:57,420
Snooze and copter says for another dollar here.

1560
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:57,659
Whoops.

1561
01:41:57,659 --> 01:41:59,340
I didn't attach a message.

1562
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:01,520
It's all good, man.

1563
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:07,460
Yeah, I've seen a couple pieces of art.

1564
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,779
The rumble a couple nights ago.

1565
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:10,819
It's great.

1566
01:42:10,819 --> 01:42:11,220
I love it.

1567
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,039
Thank you.

1568
01:42:14,579 --> 01:42:15,300
Extra cheesy.

1569
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,100
Thanks for the $1.

1570
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:16,579
Beaver.

1571
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:21,899
No, there was, there was, the beaver habitat

1572
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:24,560
was a well taken care of.

1573
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,680
Established zoologist.

1574
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:34,619
They were auto-emote incoming.

1575
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,000
The beavers were taken care of just fine.

1576
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,439
And there, there was no issues.

1577
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:42,479
There were no problems.

1578
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:46,189
Appreciate the a dollar.

1579
01:42:46,189 --> 01:42:47,949
Appreciate the a dollar though.

1580
01:42:47,949 --> 01:42:51,520
That was really, really, really worded.

1581
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:52,899
But thanks.

1582
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:56,140
Dr. Froman.

1583
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:57,100
Thanks for the $1.

1584
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,140
Thanks for being an awesome streamer.

1585
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:59,260
Looking forward to the movie night.

1586
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,220
Me too.

1587
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:02,670
It's coming up really quick.

1588
01:43:02,670 --> 01:43:04,189
Again, I got to reiterate this.

1589
01:43:04,189 --> 01:43:05,470
Make sure that if you have a submission,

1590
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:07,229
you get it in by Thursday at midnight.

1591
01:43:07,869 --> 01:43:10,270
That is not even, that's two days from now.

1592
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,220
Thursday at midnight.

1593
01:43:14,289 --> 01:43:17,489
And then make sure it is a YouTube link.

1594
01:43:18,829 --> 01:43:21,310
Check the rules and the pinned message there.

1595
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:22,189
And follow them all.

1596
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:24,880
Because if you do not follow those rules,

1597
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,039
then your submission is not going to be

1598
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:28,239
put in or considered.

1599
01:43:29,739 --> 01:43:31,260
Please follow the rules.

1600
01:43:31,899 --> 01:43:35,420
Thank you.

1601
01:43:37,569 --> 01:43:38,210
Asian Turtle.

1602
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:39,010
Thanks for the $1.

1603
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,130
I made this while I was waiting

1604
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:40,850
for the stream to start.

1605
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:42,050
And while you spent the next hour

1606
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:43,970
building an enclosure for your beavers.

1607
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:50,109
From the...

1608
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:59,439
Oh man.

1609
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:00,319
They bought a zoo.

1610
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,430
Thank you for the $1.

1611
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:09,300
Major Bluetooth.

1612
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:09,939
Thanks for the $5.

1613
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:12,180
Hey Jerma.

1614
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:13,300
Really enjoyed the latest installment

1615
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:14,260
into the rumble cannon.

1616
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:16,260
And wanted to leave a cheer in its honor.

1617
01:44:16,819 --> 01:44:17,539
Brought the great laugh.

1618
01:44:17,539 --> 01:44:19,779
Since the rumble did not have a U.S. president,

1619
01:44:19,779 --> 01:44:21,380
I took your advice and imagined

1620
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:24,579
the green screen to be William H. Taft.

1621
01:44:24,579 --> 01:44:25,779
Our 27th.

1622
01:44:25,779 --> 01:44:28,979
What a treat it was for our first U.S. president.

1623
01:44:28,979 --> 01:44:30,659
To get our first U.S. president victory

1624
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:31,699
after such an epic struggle.

1625
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:34,500
And then watch him honor his own legacy

1626
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:37,380
by getting stuck on the rope.

1627
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:38,819
Also juicy.

1628
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:44,770
Thank you Major Bluetooth for the $5.

1629
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:46,770
For that juicy five bucks.

1630
01:44:47,409 --> 01:44:54,220
Juicy fruit.

1631
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:57,619
But yeah, it could have been anybody.

1632
01:44:58,180 --> 01:44:59,140
That's why he's too powerful.

1633
01:44:59,779 --> 01:45:01,920
He will never return.

1634
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:05,680
Until I do a champion's brawl.

1635
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:08,659
Which you could probably imagine what that means.

1636
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:10,960
Swiggity dank.

1637
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,239
Thanks for the $20.

1638
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,359
Swiggity dank.

1639
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:16,819
Hey Jerma just got out of the hospital

1640
01:45:16,819 --> 01:45:21,119
from getting surgery on my nuts.

1641
01:45:22,529 --> 01:45:24,529
It doesn't feel too great as you can imagine.

1642
01:45:24,529 --> 01:45:25,329
But I'm all right.

1643
01:45:25,329 --> 01:45:27,329
And this stream is helping me keep my mind off of it.

1644
01:45:27,329 --> 01:45:27,890
Thanks man.

1645
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,029
Um, yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

1646
01:45:34,029 --> 01:45:34,909
Dude, hope you're okay.

1647
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:38,529
Thanks for the $20.

1648
01:45:39,329 --> 01:45:44,539
Hopefully you recover quickly

1649
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:45,979
and hopefully it's nothing serious.

1650
01:45:46,619 --> 01:45:49,470
Take care of yourself.

1651
01:45:49,470 --> 01:45:53,569
Thanks for the $20.

1652
01:45:54,449 --> 01:45:57,119
Hey dragon breath, thanks for the $1.

1653
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,340
Hey Jerma, in case you haven't seen,

1654
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:02,460
Joel addressed that thing about the dog smell question

1655
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:04,060
that happened during the Labo stream.

1656
01:46:04,619 --> 01:46:06,779
You should listen to this with chat for a few minutes.

1657
01:46:06,779 --> 01:46:08,140
This is a VOD link.

1658
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:13,220
It's fucking dog smell.

1659
01:46:13,779 --> 01:46:14,819
Hey, thanks a lot.

1660
01:46:15,699 --> 01:46:17,220
By the way, by the way,

1661
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:19,060
that's a rare kind of anecdote here.

1662
01:46:22,109 --> 01:46:25,250
Now, I don't know if this is the right place

1663
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:26,130
to talk about this.

1664
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:31,010
But I know that Jerma hosted me.

1665
01:46:31,649 --> 01:46:32,529
Oh, he didn't host me.

1666
01:46:32,529 --> 01:46:35,010
He was doing like a little joke on stream.

1667
01:46:35,729 --> 01:46:37,250
And I want to say I was,

1668
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:38,850
I was being a bit of an asshole,

1669
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:40,609
a no fun asshole because like.

1670
01:46:40,609 --> 01:46:41,090
Wait, what?

1671
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:42,369
No, he wasn't, was he?

1672
01:46:42,369 --> 01:46:43,170
I don't remember that.

1673
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:46,939
No, that didn't.

1674
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:50,430
Here's the, here's the deal.

1675
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:52,590
What happened last Gregory horror show stream.

1676
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:56,270
Jerma was going around and I don't fully like

1677
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:57,949
get the, the, the brunt of this joke, right?

1678
01:46:58,510 --> 01:47:01,149
But he was going around and he was like

1679
01:47:01,149 --> 01:47:02,430
having a little bit of fun, right?

1680
01:47:03,069 --> 01:47:06,590
And, uh, he was, he was having fun with,

1681
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:08,029
uh, all these streamers, right?

1682
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:11,310
And then, uh, somebody suggested

1683
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:12,750
he should like do the thing for me.

1684
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,069
And it was like some, some sort of like weird

1685
01:47:16,029 --> 01:47:18,750
raid question about dogs or something like that.

1686
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:21,229
And he did it to several people,

1687
01:47:21,229 --> 01:47:32,819
but when it came to me, I was like,

1688
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:44,380
like technical issues at the same time.

1689
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:46,699
And I was like getting back and forth

1690
01:47:46,699 --> 01:47:48,380
support from chat or something like that.

1691
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:49,579
I can't fully remember what happened,

1692
01:47:49,579 --> 01:47:51,420
but, uh, and in the midst of this,

1693
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:54,779
a bunch of like Jerma viewers bled onto

1694
01:47:54,779 --> 01:47:56,300
my stream and started asking questions.

1695
01:47:56,939 --> 01:47:59,180
And I kind of was like a bit of an asshole about it.

1696
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:00,460
I started saying like,

1697
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:02,539
hey, I really appreciate you guys like Beeman,

1698
01:48:02,539 --> 01:48:04,380
but like I'm trying to figure shit out here.

1699
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:07,659
And Jerma felt so fucking bad.

1700
01:48:07,659 --> 01:48:08,159
I did.

1701
01:48:08,699 --> 01:48:09,420
I really did.

1702
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:10,539
For like a good solid hour.

1703
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:15,819
Basically saying, hey guys, like be chill.

1704
01:48:15,819 --> 01:48:18,619
And like, I really did feel so bad for like

1705
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:20,060
not playing along.

1706
01:48:21,579 --> 01:48:23,180
Just to like make sure here,

1707
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:25,579
like I have no absolute, no bad fucking

1708
01:48:26,539 --> 01:48:30,300
blog between Jerma and I is a super cool guy.

1709
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,500
And I got to say this too,

1710
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:35,100
the fact that he apologized and he was like,

1711
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,579
guys, just chill out that that shows respect.

1712
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:41,020
And, uh, I'm fine with playing along with stuff like that,

1713
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,699
but just the fact that he did apologize for it,

1714
01:48:42,699 --> 01:48:44,220
because there's a lot of people that are like,

1715
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,539
they don't give a shit what their audience does

1716
01:48:46,539 --> 01:48:47,420
or this chat does.

1717
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,619
And the fact that he stepped out of the way

1718
01:48:48,619 --> 01:48:50,539
to like kind of not police his chat,

1719
01:48:50,539 --> 01:48:53,420
but you say, you know, calm down, you know,

1720
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:54,699
I appreciate that, you know,

1721
01:48:54,699 --> 01:48:58,060
so, uh, you know, call me, call me,

1722
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:02,220
Jerma, we can get into all kinds of weird,

1723
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,979
uh, stinky role play if you want.

1724
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:10,260
Nah, that's all good.

1725
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:13,340
He's a good dude.

1726
01:49:20,529 --> 01:49:22,529
I wasn't under the impression that there was any

1727
01:49:23,329 --> 01:49:23,890
problem at all.

1728
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:25,250
I just want to, you know, I mean,

1729
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:26,529
because sometimes the people,

1730
01:49:28,609 --> 01:49:30,449
I was kind of losing my mind on stream

1731
01:49:30,449 --> 01:49:31,970
and we were going like, he's right.

1732
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:34,130
We were bouncing around to different places

1733
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:36,609
and critical started throwing cards at me

1734
01:49:37,409 --> 01:49:39,649
and ran into italics's stream and, you know,

1735
01:49:39,649 --> 01:49:42,270
we were just having fun and, uh,

1736
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:44,109
but I think if you like trying to get shit done,

1737
01:49:45,229 --> 01:49:46,430
if you have something going on

1738
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:47,630
and you're trying to figure out something

1739
01:49:47,630 --> 01:49:48,510
and all of a sudden it's like,

1740
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:50,750
you kind of like what the hell

1741
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,109
he's supposed to do it at that point, right?

1742
01:49:56,770 --> 01:50:02,020
But no, there's, it's all good.

1743
01:50:02,579 --> 01:50:04,510
He's a great dude.

1744
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:11,069
Drunk Labo stream like strikes again.

1745
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:24,210
You drank 400 glasses of wine.

1746
01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:32,770
Hey, but anyways, uh, yeah, that's that.

1747
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:39,859
And, uh, did I, yeah, extra cheesy gave $13

1748
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:43,439
to ask about my favorite animal.

1749
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:45,680
And I said, I wanted a laptop or something.

1750
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,359
I don't remember, but thank you so much.

1751
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:48,720
Extra cheesy for the 13 bucks.

1752
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:51,119
Armadillo was the correct answer,

1753
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:54,189
but thank you.

1754
01:50:55,170 --> 01:50:57,329
Extra cheesy again came in with $3

1755
01:50:57,329 --> 01:50:58,850
on your next German craft playthrough.

1756
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:00,210
You need to make a creeper zoo.

1757
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:08,500
Thank you.

1758
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,020
Thank you, Dr. Garbage and friends

1759
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,579
for the $1.

1760
01:51:10,579 --> 01:51:11,859
Hey Jeremy, you should play the

1761
01:51:11,859 --> 01:51:14,500
re-release Spyro and ruin my childhood.

1762
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:18,220
I don't want to ruin your child.

1763
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:18,779
What's wrong with it?

1764
01:51:18,779 --> 01:51:19,819
Is the new Spyro not good?

1765
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:21,420
I heard, I thought it was good,

1766
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:25,840
but thank you.

1767
01:51:26,659 --> 01:51:30,180
Thank you, uh, 9e for the $1.

1768
01:51:31,489 --> 01:51:33,329
Name the restrooms after chat.

1769
01:51:37,229 --> 01:51:38,829
Smelly boy, thanks for $1.

1770
01:51:38,829 --> 01:51:47,630
Please say zoo-we-mama three times fast.

1771
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:48,430
I bet you can't.

1772
01:51:52,510 --> 01:51:53,229
I'm not going to do that.

1773
01:51:53,789 --> 01:51:58,340
Hold on.

1774
01:51:58,340 --> 01:51:59,699
I'm mute my microphone for a second.

1775
01:52:09,409 --> 01:52:09,970
I don't get it.

1776
01:52:10,689 --> 01:52:14,800
I don't understand.

1777
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:27,890
This is, this is a meme.

1778
01:52:27,890 --> 01:52:28,369
Don't worry.

1779
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:29,010
Okay, fine.

1780
01:52:29,729 --> 01:52:30,770
We don't do memes here.

1781
01:52:31,569 --> 01:52:33,010
Hey Garfield, the Monday killer.

1782
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:33,890
Thanks for the $1.

1783
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:34,369
Ho, ho, ho.

1784
01:52:34,369 --> 01:52:35,409
It's almost that time of year again.

1785
01:52:35,409 --> 01:52:37,170
Wonder what you want for Christmas.

1786
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:38,289
I can't finish a movie.

1787
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:41,649
I can't finish a movie in for the stream.

1788
01:52:42,369 --> 01:52:43,970
The movie stream since I got finals soon,

1789
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:45,329
but the German cinematic universe

1790
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:47,649
has not yet halted production.

1791
01:52:48,210 --> 01:52:49,890
Odie, watch what you're doing.

1792
01:52:49,890 --> 01:52:51,970
That boom mic cost a whole $30.

1793
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:53,409
What a crazy dog.

1794
01:52:53,409 --> 01:52:55,090
I bet Otto doesn't do stuff like that.

1795
01:52:55,090 --> 01:52:56,050
Don't drop that.

1796
01:52:56,050 --> 01:52:57,329
You're fired.

1797
01:52:57,329 --> 01:52:58,930
Congratulations on another awesome Germania.

1798
01:52:58,930 --> 01:53:00,289
You always put so much work.

1799
01:53:00,289 --> 01:53:01,489
Did you just drop it, Odie?

1800
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:10,579
Thank you for the $1 Garfield.

1801
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,369
Appreciate it.

1802
01:53:13,489 --> 01:53:14,130
Barfield.

1803
01:53:14,130 --> 01:53:14,930
I'm going to, you know,

1804
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:16,930
your name now is Barfield.

1805
01:53:18,189 --> 01:53:18,750
Barfield.

1806
01:53:24,859 --> 01:53:26,779
I just quantum died.

1807
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:35,899
I'm going to remember Barfield.

1808
01:53:36,539 --> 01:53:38,800
Barfield is going to have like

1809
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,159
puke on his face and be green.

1810
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:43,420
All right, quantum dead.

1811
01:53:46,189 --> 01:53:47,550
Thank you, Garfield, for the $1.

1812
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,800
Hey, Pilot Guy.

1813
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,359
Thank you, Pilot Guy, for the $20, Pilot Guy.

1814
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,329
Hey, German, just want to say thank you

1815
01:53:57,329 --> 01:53:58,850
for all the laughs through my times of stress.

1816
01:53:58,850 --> 01:54:00,289
You've always been here and helped me smile.

1817
01:54:00,289 --> 01:54:00,770
Thank you.

1818
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:01,250
Thank you.

1819
01:54:02,289 --> 01:54:04,210
Thank you, Pilot Guy, for your $20

1820
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:07,170
and for being here.

1821
01:54:08,289 --> 01:54:14,180
More importantly, thank you so much.

1822
01:54:15,619 --> 01:54:17,699
Bake Me Home, thanks for $13.

1823
01:54:17,699 --> 01:54:19,539
It's a good thing you're streaming

1824
01:54:19,539 --> 01:54:21,939
because I dread to live in a world

1825
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,699
where you actually ran an amusement park.

1826
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:25,460
German land.

1827
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:28,800
It's a good thing it's just a stream.

1828
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,659
I think I would do a pretty good job.

1829
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:43,020
You laugh now.

1830
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:46,100
But thank you.

1831
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:46,979
Thank you, Bake Me Home.

1832
01:54:46,979 --> 01:54:48,420
Thank you, Pilot Guy.

1833
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:49,699
$20, $13.

1834
01:54:51,329 --> 01:54:53,810
Flabjack, thanks for the $2, Flabjack.

1835
01:54:54,369 --> 01:54:55,970
When are you going to give us comedy lessons?

1836
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:57,409
I'm looking forward to that stream,

1837
01:54:57,409 --> 01:54:58,210
funny streamer.

1838
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:02,510
Comedy lessons.

1839
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:05,979
I don't know.

1840
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:07,260
When is that going to happen?

1841
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:10,899
Who knows?

1842
01:55:10,899 --> 01:55:11,380
Thank you.

1843
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:19,199
Thank you, Bunny Butt, for the $1, $2, $3, $4, $5 here.

1844
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:20,319
Bunny Butt.

1845
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:24,220
How does one go about making stupid camera jokes?

1846
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:26,460
I'm hoping for advice from my own streams.

1847
01:55:29,470 --> 01:55:30,590
Stupid camera jokes.

1848
01:55:31,229 --> 01:55:34,340
How many bits do I have to spend to name him Skateboard?

1849
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:41,380
Well, I didn't make him have any name.

1850
01:55:44,699 --> 01:55:45,899
But stupid camera jokes.

1851
01:55:45,899 --> 01:55:46,380
I don't...

1852
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:52,939
Get a camera and do the default Fortnite dance in front of it.

1853
01:55:52,939 --> 01:55:54,619
And then have a green screen behind you

1854
01:55:54,619 --> 01:56:01,680
and like key yourself into like a genie bottle or something.

1855
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:07,199
And then when the person rubs you out of the bottle,

1856
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:09,920
of the bottle, of the bottle, of the genie bottle,

1857
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:12,479
when you come out of the genie bottle,

1858
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:14,800
you can like give them like a hundred,

1859
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,199
never mind, moving on, a hundred wee bucks.

1860
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:20,319
Not wee, like Nintendo wee.

1861
01:56:20,319 --> 01:56:20,960
Vee bucks.

1862
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:30,369
That threw me off so bad because of the stupid shit that I just said.

1863
01:56:30,369 --> 01:56:31,329
But thank you, Bunny Butt.

1864
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:34,270
Sorry, I didn't name him Skateboard.

1865
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:37,600
Severian, the great.

1866
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:39,920
Thanks for your $11, Severian.

1867
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,199
Thank you so much.

1868
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,079
No message.

1869
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:46,319
Just $11 fucking dollars.

1870
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:46,640
Thank you.

1871
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:49,489
Thank you so much.

1872
01:56:49,489 --> 01:56:51,649
Hater the Tater for the $5.

1873
01:56:51,649 --> 01:56:57,140
Actually, more like $11 here from Hater the Tater.

1874
01:56:58,659 --> 01:57:00,979
Jar Jar with fun size is Jerjer.

1875
01:57:01,619 --> 01:57:02,579
Jerjer.

1876
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:05,979
That gets an e-heave from me.

1877
01:57:05,979 --> 01:57:07,260
That gets an e-heave from me.

1878
01:57:08,529 --> 01:57:10,850
Also, stream is now middle-aged, rocky, and unstable,

1879
01:57:10,850 --> 01:57:12,529
but still going like Jerma.

1880
01:57:12,529 --> 01:57:14,930
You're not middle-aged until you're like 45 or 50 years old.

1881
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:15,329
I'm fine.

1882
01:57:15,329 --> 01:57:16,369
I'm doing just good enough.

1883
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:18,960
Thank you for your $11.

1884
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,699
Appreciate it.

1885
01:57:20,699 --> 01:57:22,380
That gets a little bit of an e-heave from me.

1886
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:23,260
You know what I'm saying?

1887
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:25,170
Mostly lost.

1888
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:27,090
Thanks for the $2 here.

1889
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:28,609
I liked Just Cause 3 a lot.

1890
01:57:28,609 --> 01:57:31,569
I think it would be a great game to play.

1891
01:57:31,569 --> 01:57:32,750
Jerma game.

1892
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:37,409
Yeah, I mean, I'm going to give it a try.

1893
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:43,630
Just Cause 4 comes out in like 6.

1894
01:57:48,289 --> 01:57:53,260
EDF 5 comes out in less than a week and a half.

1895
01:57:57,039 --> 01:57:58,239
Oh, shit.

1896
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:04,380
Wow, I forgot about that.

1897
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,560
Earth Defense Force 5 comes out on PlayStation 4.

1898
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:10,159
December 10th?

1899
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:10,800
December 11th?

1900
01:58:13,409 --> 01:58:16,130
Well, you bet your ass you know what we're doing

1901
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:18,289
on the 10th, 11th, and 12th.

1902
01:58:18,289 --> 01:58:24,619
It's going to be that.

1903
01:58:30,369 --> 01:58:30,930
But thank you.

1904
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:32,050
Again, mostly lost.

1905
01:58:32,050 --> 01:58:33,489
And it's got the right balance of fun,

1906
01:58:33,489 --> 01:58:35,970
gameplay, and mechanics with a laughably bad story.

1907
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:37,090
That's Just Cause 3.

1908
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:43,779
I remember Star made a video on Just Cause 3.

1909
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:46,800
Looked pretty ridiculous.

1910
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,899
So definitely kind of up my alley.

1911
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:53,810
Sputa.

1912
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:54,529
Thanks for the $1.

1913
01:58:54,529 --> 01:58:57,250
I'm sorry I can only go for small bits this time.

1914
01:58:57,250 --> 01:58:58,850
But considering you get so many bit messages,

1915
01:58:58,850 --> 01:59:00,850
I'm sure it gets difficult to remember them all.

1916
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:03,090
But do you ever think back to messages from long ago,

1917
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:05,970
rather as a pick-me-up or just in general?

1918
01:59:07,939 --> 01:59:10,020
Um, stuff sticks with me.

1919
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:10,420
It does.

1920
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:14,000
It can be, like you said, it can be very difficult though.

1921
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:19,279
Trying to bring back the memories of donation messages

1922
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:20,239
or bit messages.

1923
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:24,500
And I try my best to keep, you know,

1924
01:59:25,619 --> 01:59:27,060
as many as I can fit up there.

1925
01:59:30,579 --> 01:59:32,420
But that's, it gets hard.

1926
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:35,789
It's just that I never want to be one of those people

1927
01:59:35,789 --> 01:59:36,829
that's just like, thanks for the dollar.

1928
01:59:36,829 --> 01:59:37,630
Thanks for five bucks.

1929
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:38,029
Bye bye.

1930
01:59:38,029 --> 01:59:38,350
Thank you.

1931
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:38,670
Thank bye.

1932
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:39,310
Thanks for the money.

1933
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:42,399
But it is a challenge.

1934
01:59:42,399 --> 01:59:45,659
Do you talk to yourself while playing games offline too?

1935
01:59:45,659 --> 01:59:50,180
Yes, I do.

1936
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:56,319
Like the one where I made you cry.

1937
01:59:57,119 --> 02:00:04,689
Yeah, I mean, you guys, it's,

1938
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:07,890
I don't just take it lightly, you know?

1939
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:11,890
Some of you guys have given a lot of fucking money.

1940
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:13,729
A lot of money, a lot of time,

1941
02:00:13,729 --> 02:00:14,770
a lot of your free time.

1942
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:18,180
And there are lots of, here's the thing, right?

1943
02:00:18,819 --> 02:00:21,779
The reason why I want to care so much about this

1944
02:00:21,859 --> 02:00:27,060
and take it as, try as hard as I can on certain scenarios

1945
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:28,340
and try to come up with things to do

1946
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:30,420
is because there are so many other avenues

1947
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,539
for you to use your free time.

1948
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:36,989
Thousands of people, hundreds of shows,

1949
02:00:36,989 --> 02:00:39,630
thousands and thousands of avenues for entertainment.

1950
02:00:41,739 --> 02:00:44,859
It means an absolute metric shitload

1951
02:00:45,819 --> 02:00:48,220
that out of all the possible places, you're here.

1952
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:52,239
So I have to take it fucking seriously

1953
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:56,239
because that's a huge, huge, huge thing.

1954
02:01:06,829 --> 02:01:08,270
And I'm going to do it for as long as I can,

1955
02:01:11,779 --> 02:01:12,739
as long as I'm having fun

1956
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:15,060
and can keep coming up with stuff I'd like to do.

1957
02:01:15,779 --> 02:01:18,739
I don't want to get to that position where it's like,

1958
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:22,659
I'm just doing it just to do it because I,

1959
02:01:22,659 --> 02:01:24,500
because I'm going to because that's what I do

1960
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,300
and I'm just going to do it.

1961
02:01:26,819 --> 02:01:27,859
No, I don't want to do that.

1962
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:32,560
Until 40, when I can't say swears anymore.

1963
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:33,039
That's, yeah.

1964
02:01:40,779 --> 02:01:47,060
It's true, you can't, but thank you.

1965
02:01:47,539 --> 02:01:48,659
Thank you, Sputa.

1966
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:51,760
Thank you, Pancakes for the $1.

1967
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:53,199
Just want to say you smell like a shoe.

1968
02:01:53,199 --> 02:01:54,479
I really appreciate all your content.

1969
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:54,960
Keep it up.

1970
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:55,920
Let me see.

1971
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,420
Now that's Dove Men Plus Care.

1972
02:02:02,619 --> 02:02:04,300
Fucking Walmart brand.

1973
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,640
Thank you, Pancakes.

1974
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:08,239
Thank you, Twitchy Pyro for the $1.

1975
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:09,600
Jerma, thanks for providing a good laugh

1976
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:10,319
while I try to figure out

1977
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:13,119
how to get out of this walk-in oven.

1978
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:13,840
I'll keep at it.

1979
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,720
Try banging on the door and saying, hey,

1980
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,520
somebody will go up the fuck and open it probably.

1981
02:02:21,819 --> 02:02:22,460
Thank you.

1982
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:24,369
Thank you, DubskiDude for the $1.

1983
02:02:24,369 --> 02:02:25,489
Hey, Jerma, I've been a fan of your content

1984
02:02:25,489 --> 02:02:28,529
since kindergarten how time flies.

1985
02:02:28,529 --> 02:02:31,649
I'm already a great grandfather and on my deathbed.

1986
02:02:31,649 --> 02:02:33,329
I remember the smoke signal streams

1987
02:02:33,329 --> 02:02:35,010
you used to do with the pilgrims.

1988
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:35,890
Good times, man.

1989
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:37,729
And let's not forget how you goofed

1990
02:02:37,729 --> 02:02:39,170
on the Mesopotamians.

1991
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:41,170
Their civilization wasn't the same after that one.

1992
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:44,850
Can't wait for another 6.7 million years

1993
02:02:45,409 --> 02:02:46,609
of quality streams.

1994
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,850
Keep it up, you timeless streamer boy.

1995
02:03:09,649 --> 02:03:10,529
Thank you, DubskiDude.

1996
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:13,100
Thank you for the $1.

1997
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:16,140
And we're going for another 7 million years.

1998
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:18,060
They're going to figure it out.

1999
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:19,260
They'll figure out like robotics

2000
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:21,579
and I'll be able to put like an implant in my chest.

2001
02:03:29,539 --> 02:03:32,020
Thank you, SpicyMexicanTaco for the $1.

2002
02:03:32,659 --> 02:03:35,699
Thank you, $5.

2003
02:03:36,829 --> 02:03:38,270
Dr. Clay for the $1.

2004
02:03:38,989 --> 02:03:41,869
Just want to say I hate the menu in WWE2K19.

2005
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:44,510
It's just white background with gray text

2006
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:46,029
that says the menu selection.

2007
02:03:46,029 --> 02:03:48,270
The UI literally looks like a placeholder.

2008
02:03:51,939 --> 02:03:52,340
I know.

2009
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:54,020
Oh, yeah, I know.

2010
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:58,189
All the menus in these WWE games lately.

2011
02:04:01,149 --> 02:04:02,829
Just awful.

2012
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:06,850
Even the character creator,

2013
02:04:06,850 --> 02:04:10,289
there's a menu for a menu inside of a menu to get to,

2014
02:04:10,289 --> 02:04:12,289
okay, you want to change somebody's hair.

2015
02:04:12,289 --> 02:04:15,489
Click on, okay, you got to go to body,

2016
02:04:15,489 --> 02:04:18,289
a lot of appearance, facial appearances,

2017
02:04:18,289 --> 02:04:19,569
and then the hair and then it's just,

2018
02:04:19,569 --> 02:04:21,409
there's like four menus.

2019
02:04:22,130 --> 02:04:24,560
There's so many menus that just stacked

2020
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:25,840
on top of each other.

2021
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:31,409
I would really much rather,

2022
02:04:31,409 --> 02:04:33,729
and I don't know why they don't do this.

2023
02:04:33,729 --> 02:04:34,449
I don't understand.

2024
02:04:35,779 --> 02:04:40,180
Wrestling is not like baseball or football or...

2025
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:43,859
Don't worry.

2026
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:47,380
Sheamus is still going to exist in 2020.

2027
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:47,939
You know what I mean?

2028
02:04:50,689 --> 02:04:52,689
They're turning it into this roster update

2029
02:04:52,689 --> 02:04:54,609
where they add a handful of features.

2030
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:58,050
It's not like, oh, every single year,

2031
02:04:59,090 --> 02:05:01,250
hundreds and hundreds of people change teams.

2032
02:05:04,029 --> 02:05:05,710
And you could argue that that could just be done

2033
02:05:05,710 --> 02:05:07,949
with something as simple as a patch, right?

2034
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,359
Wrestling isn't real, so...

2035
02:05:18,319 --> 02:05:19,920
Well, I mean, there's the aspect of like

2036
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:22,319
the fantasy kind of fiction aspect to it, yeah.

2037
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:28,720
But I don't know why they have to come up

2038
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:29,760
with one every single year.

2039
02:05:32,659 --> 02:05:33,779
It doesn't need to happen.

2040
02:05:33,779 --> 02:05:35,380
That didn't happen before.

2041
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:37,859
That's a fairly recent thing,

2042
02:05:37,859 --> 02:05:38,899
the last probably 10 years.

2043
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:42,180
A wrestling game would come out

2044
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:44,579
when a wrestling game decided it was going to come out.

2045
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:50,560
And turning the WWE franchise

2046
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:54,079
into a Madden-like simulation sports game

2047
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:57,810
that has to come out on a yearly schedule

2048
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:00,689
is, in my opinion, is killing the whole thing.

2049
02:06:00,689 --> 02:06:01,810
It's killing the whole franchise.

2050
02:06:05,779 --> 02:06:07,939
And I would not be somebody that's...

2051
02:06:07,939 --> 02:06:09,699
My opinion is that's not an unpopular opinion.

2052
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:14,880
All of these games over the last five, six, or seven years

2053
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:17,439
is at least the last six.

2054
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:20,399
With the exception of maybe one or two of them

2055
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:25,899
have been pretty, I would say, very mediocre ratings and reviews.

2056
02:06:25,899 --> 02:06:27,180
Just like, eh, it's not special.

2057
02:06:27,899 --> 02:06:29,979
It's just bad and it's not very good.

2058
02:06:38,159 --> 02:06:39,600
It's... I don't understand.

2059
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:48,239
After 2006 is when they started doing it every year,

2060
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:50,479
but those early ones were still good.

2061
02:06:51,279 --> 02:06:52,079
So you don't know what happened.

2062
02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:54,319
Well, what happened is THQ was liquidated

2063
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:58,720
and 2K ended up taking on the franchise.

2064
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:05,539
And they turned it into the NBA, you know, NBA 2K,

2065
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:08,180
WWE 2K, and, you know,

2066
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,260
they had the teams at 2K that do sports

2067
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:13,920
start to contribute to the games that, you know,

2068
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:15,600
they took on the license from the WWE.

2069
02:07:16,319 --> 02:07:22,640
That's kind of what happened.

2070
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:32,819
To be honest, like, for real, THQ may be one of the...

2071
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:35,779
People, like, talked about it for a little while,

2072
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:37,300
but you don't even realize just how...

2073
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:41,149
That's like a pretty devastating loss to gaming.

2074
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:45,300
There were some really great fucking titles

2075
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:46,899
that were underneath THQ.

2076
02:07:46,979 --> 02:07:58,029
You can think about, oh, yeah, THQ got, like,

2077
02:07:58,029 --> 02:08:00,270
wiped out and liquidated and gone.

2078
02:08:01,069 --> 02:08:02,029
Oh, wow, that sucks.

2079
02:08:02,029 --> 02:08:02,909
Oh, that's too bad.

2080
02:08:02,909 --> 02:08:04,189
But then you realize, like,

2081
02:08:04,189 --> 02:08:05,869
the rippling effects that that has.

2082
02:08:06,670 --> 02:08:16,079
They made some pretty great games,

2083
02:08:16,079 --> 02:08:18,000
or at least they had enough to do with them.

2084
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:27,649
But I could sit here and be sad about...

2085
02:08:28,939 --> 02:08:29,579
And I don't know.

2086
02:08:29,579 --> 02:08:30,699
Maybe I am one of those people

2087
02:08:30,699 --> 02:08:36,100
that's speaking from a small audience.

2088
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:36,739
You know what I mean?

2089
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:39,060
Because I don't know.

2090
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:40,899
The reasons why I like the WWE games

2091
02:08:40,899 --> 02:08:42,420
is because I like to make stuff.

2092
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:44,739
I like to make scenarios.

2093
02:08:44,739 --> 02:08:48,180
And, oh, remember in WWE 2K14,

2094
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:49,939
you could actually put your characters

2095
02:08:49,939 --> 02:08:51,220
into, like, cutscenes?

2096
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:55,600
That shit was fucking awesome.

2097
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:59,039
There was like 40 or 50 different scenarios

2098
02:08:59,039 --> 02:09:00,399
you could put the characters in

2099
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:01,520
to play out on screen.

2100
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:06,060
Just to use that game, I can't,

2101
02:09:07,359 --> 02:09:09,119
because it just does not hold up well at all.

2102
02:09:11,069 --> 02:09:13,069
That game is only for PlayStation 3.

2103
02:09:13,869 --> 02:09:19,199
And it takes, like, 15 seconds sometimes.

2104
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:21,340
20, 30 seconds.

2105
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:24,300
Once you have an elaborate character designed,

2106
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:24,779
it can take...

2107
02:09:25,939 --> 02:09:27,220
It's just so long.

2108
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,420
It's so slow.

2109
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:30,020
The menus are slow.

2110
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:31,619
The creation is so slow.

2111
02:09:31,619 --> 02:09:32,899
It's just very outdated.

2112
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:46,239
So it would take, essentially,

2113
02:09:46,239 --> 02:09:47,359
probably two or three times

2114
02:09:47,359 --> 02:09:51,520
the amount of time to make a character

2115
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:53,359
than use the current-gen version.

2116
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:01,060
And maybe it would be worth it,

2117
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:02,670
but I don't know.

2118
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:04,829
I just wish that they would...

2119
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:08,239
I mean, who knows?

2120
02:10:08,239 --> 02:10:09,520
I don't know what the data is,

2121
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,239
what they have,

2122
02:10:10,239 --> 02:10:12,880
or what people want out of a wrestling game.

2123
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:17,489
But I like the crazy league aspect of it,

2124
02:10:17,489 --> 02:10:18,930
where people get to make their own leagues

2125
02:10:18,930 --> 02:10:20,930
and make their own interesting storylines.

2126
02:10:20,930 --> 02:10:24,020
And that's what I did

2127
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:26,420
when I was 14, 15, 16.

2128
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:28,689
We would make entire...

2129
02:10:28,689 --> 02:10:29,890
We would make entire...

2130
02:10:29,890 --> 02:10:31,010
Me and my friends would just sit there

2131
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:32,770
and just make whole scenarios.

2132
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:33,649
Make whole leagues.

2133
02:10:34,369 --> 02:10:39,340
We used to make our dads,

2134
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:41,100
and our dads would fight each other in the ring.

2135
02:10:42,430 --> 02:10:43,949
And it was like all storylines

2136
02:10:43,949 --> 02:10:46,430
attached to each other's dads.

2137
02:10:53,699 --> 02:10:54,420
That's what I want.

2138
02:11:03,409 --> 02:11:04,529
I could care less if...

2139
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:06,859
Oh, you know,

2140
02:11:08,210 --> 02:11:11,680
the Hulk Hogan's in this one.

2141
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:13,890
That's cool.

2142
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:14,529
Okay.

2143
02:11:14,529 --> 02:11:16,609
I can make Hulk Hogan.

2144
02:11:16,609 --> 02:11:17,810
I can just make him.

2145
02:11:17,810 --> 02:11:22,319
But I'll get off that rant.

2146
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:28,029
Dad voice.

2147
02:11:30,529 --> 02:11:32,449
But anyways, let's wrap it up here.

2148
02:11:33,729 --> 02:11:34,609
Mandragor root.

2149
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:36,210
Thanks for the $1.

2150
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:38,899
Mazekit, thanks for the $1.

2151
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:42,539
Is the new home treating you well?

2152
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:43,500
Yeah.

2153
02:11:44,699 --> 02:11:47,500
I'd say settling in pretty nicely.

2154
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:52,619
Las Vegas is an awesome place.

2155
02:11:52,619 --> 02:11:54,060
There's tons to do, tons to see.

2156
02:11:54,859 --> 02:11:57,460
So yeah, I'm loving it.

2157
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,220
For sure.

2158
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,479
Thank you, Burger B for the $5.

2159
02:12:04,539 --> 02:12:05,739
Me and a few of the Discord boys

2160
02:12:05,739 --> 02:12:07,180
have been trying to find the most effective way

2161
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:08,140
to thaw bread.

2162
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:09,420
What are your thoughts?

2163
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:09,979
Keep it real.

2164
02:12:11,949 --> 02:12:13,090
How to thaw bread.

2165
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:17,180
How frozen is it?

2166
02:12:19,390 --> 02:12:22,130
Is it like rock solid

2167
02:12:22,130 --> 02:12:29,680
or is it just slightly crystalline on the inside?

2168
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:30,640
It's like an ice cube.

2169
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:34,939
Well, you could.

2170
02:12:37,869 --> 02:12:39,869
I mean, you could just sit on it for a little while.

2171
02:12:42,609 --> 02:12:43,729
Just take it out.

2172
02:12:43,729 --> 02:12:46,210
Just sit on it like a penguin.

2173
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:53,789
But make sure you have like jeans on

2174
02:12:53,789 --> 02:12:55,310
so it doesn't like get too cold.

2175
02:12:59,100 --> 02:13:01,180
My best thought was to light it on fire in a toilet.

2176
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:02,619
Now that is a terrible idea.

2177
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:06,079
No, put it in the microwave on thaw.

2178
02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:08,239
Every microwave has a thaw setting.

2179
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:09,840
You just have to look at the manual.

2180
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,720
Look at the instructional manual of your microwave

2181
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:14,479
and it'll be a thaw setting.

2182
02:13:14,479 --> 02:13:16,159
Thaw it maybe a minute or two.

2183
02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:16,960
Check it.

2184
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:17,680
Is it spongy?

2185
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:19,279
No, put it back in the other thaw setting.

2186
02:13:21,659 --> 02:13:23,739
Why would you sit naked on bread?

2187
02:13:23,739 --> 02:13:24,460
I didn't say that.

2188
02:13:24,460 --> 02:13:26,539
That's why I said wear a pair of jeans.

2189
02:13:31,569 --> 02:13:34,289
Microwaving bread sounds like the saddest thing in the world.

2190
02:13:43,810 --> 02:13:44,930
There's no reason to do that.

2191
02:13:45,329 --> 02:13:46,369
If you get a piece of bread.

2192
02:13:46,369 --> 02:13:47,649
Oh, I'm gonna make like a sandwich.

2193
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:51,220
Just stick it in there and just put for 30 seconds.

2194
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:52,020
That'd be awful.

2195
02:13:58,859 --> 02:14:00,619
It would turn into shit.

2196
02:14:00,619 --> 02:14:02,460
It would be so sloppy.

2197
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,579
It would just pull apart.

2198
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:09,500
Set it to defrost.

2199
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:10,220
Yeah.

2200
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:18,979
Am I gonna play Kingdom Hearts 3 when it comes out?

2201
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:21,020
I don't know.

2202
02:14:21,659 --> 02:14:22,220
I don't know.

2203
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:24,699
Probably not on stream.

2204
02:14:26,399 --> 02:14:27,359
I don't think so.

2205
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,420
I feel like there's really only one way.

2206
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:33,619
Here's how I decide if it's something I want to stream.

2207
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:38,640
When there's really only one way to complete and play through a game,

2208
02:14:40,689 --> 02:14:42,850
I'm not like that interested in streaming it.

2209
02:14:43,489 --> 02:14:45,250
And I say that for one reason because

2210
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:49,229
I don't know if you watch a Kingdom Hearts stream that's,

2211
02:14:49,869 --> 02:14:51,390
you know, pointed every direction.

2212
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:54,109
If you're, oh, I'm in the Kingdom Hearts 3 directory.

2213
02:14:54,109 --> 02:14:54,430
Okay.

2214
02:14:55,229 --> 02:14:58,500
All of us here are doing the same thing.

2215
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:00,100
We're seeing the same cutscenes.

2216
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:01,779
We're seeing the same story.

2217
02:15:01,779 --> 02:15:03,300
And I got the same keyblade.

2218
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:06,000
There's not very much difference between them.

2219
02:15:10,609 --> 02:15:12,770
You want to reenact Kingdom Hearts on stream.

2220
02:15:15,649 --> 02:15:16,369
I can't do that either.

2221
02:15:16,369 --> 02:15:17,090
I don't know the script.

2222
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:21,250
But that's just not, I don't,

2223
02:15:21,250 --> 02:15:23,090
that's how I determine if it's something I want to stream.

2224
02:15:26,029 --> 02:15:28,590
How different is my experience going to be from the person

2225
02:15:28,590 --> 02:15:30,590
that's potentially right next to me?

2226
02:15:32,909 --> 02:15:36,430
Is there enough there that makes it fun enough, different enough?

2227
02:15:37,149 --> 02:15:42,539
I'm sure it's going to be a great game.

2228
02:15:51,630 --> 02:15:52,350
I don't know.

2229
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:56,539
But with that, thank you, Elizabeth, for the $1.

2230
02:15:56,539 --> 02:15:57,260
Germa Defoe.

2231
02:15:57,899 --> 02:16:00,130
And here come the credits.

2232
02:16:00,989 --> 02:16:03,630
Thank you for joining me on this just hang out,

2233
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:04,829
relaxed, chill stream.

2234
02:16:07,489 --> 02:16:08,609
I had a good time.

2235
02:16:08,609 --> 02:16:11,170
You know, I was like really chill tonight.

2236
02:16:11,170 --> 02:16:11,890
Don't you think?

2237
02:16:11,890 --> 02:16:12,529
Don't you think so?

2238
02:16:18,510 --> 02:16:19,869
You guys, were you guys relaxed?

2239
02:16:22,430 --> 02:16:24,590
Making like dinosaurs and shit, walking around.

2240
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:29,340
Yeah. Yeah.

2241
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:32,559
Should check out Zoo Tycoon 1.

2242
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:34,159
Actually, that's what I'm going to do when the stream turns off.

2243
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:44,500
But thank you to all the subs, everyone that just came in.

2244
02:16:46,989 --> 02:16:48,670
New subs, old subs.

2245
02:16:50,379 --> 02:16:51,260
There are a lot of you now.

2246
02:16:54,399 --> 02:16:56,239
There are a lot of subs.

2247
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:02,879
Chat keeps trying to make you cry,

2248
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:05,040
but maybe you should make chat cry.

2249
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:06,559
No, why would I want to do that?

2250
02:17:06,559 --> 02:17:07,440
I don't want to do that.

2251
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:14,340
Possibility of a game show week?

2252
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:19,600
Well, let's see what I haven't played.

2253
02:17:27,389 --> 02:17:28,350
You broke your nail.

2254
02:17:29,069 --> 02:17:29,790
That's not good.

2255
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:35,709
Grump broke a nail.

2256
02:17:36,719 --> 02:17:40,030
Which one?

2257
02:17:40,030 --> 02:17:41,069
Germa May Cry.

2258
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:45,280
Good night, pal.

2259
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:46,879
I'll sub when I can.

2260
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:49,680
I've been a ghost viewer for a while until I finally made my account today.

2261
02:17:50,159 --> 02:17:51,760
So good to interact with chat.

2262
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:54,579
Well, welcome to chat.

2263
02:17:55,139 --> 02:18:01,229
And there's another one that just came in.

2264
02:18:01,229 --> 02:18:02,190
14 months there.

2265
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:08,219
A hand nail.

2266
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:11,139
There's one of them on the hands.

2267
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:16,350
Now you got to go to the nail blacksmith.

2268
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:21,069
You put your finger out and he just takes a hammer and he's just

2269
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:29,010
Welcome to my Twitch chat room.

2270
02:18:29,569 --> 02:18:33,899
So I will see you guys tomorrow.

2271
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:37,139
Red Dead Online.

2272
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:38,899
Let's see if it's any good.

2273
02:18:39,620 --> 02:18:41,459
Otherwise, we're going to transition to like

2274
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:44,780
me fucking raiding cereal boxes.

2275
02:18:54,110 --> 02:18:54,590
Yee-haw.

2276
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:00,780
Play Jackbox with us?

2277
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:02,219
Oh yeah, that's true.

2278
02:19:02,219 --> 02:19:02,940
All right, here's the thing.

2279
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:05,100
If Red Dead Online is just like, oh, okay.

2280
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:06,860
I'm like riding around and running into trees.

2281
02:19:07,659 --> 02:19:10,860
The random guy threw a grenade at me and it's that for like three hours or something.

2282
02:19:10,860 --> 02:19:12,299
We'll play Jackbox tomorrow.

2283
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:14,219
That would be fun.

2284
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:16,879
Yeah, why the fuck not?

2285
02:19:16,879 --> 02:19:17,280
Let's do it.

2286
02:19:18,879 --> 02:19:21,120
Or if Red Dead is good, then hold on to that.

2287
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:22,159
We'll probably do that on Friday.

2288
02:19:23,889 --> 02:19:25,010
Yeah, fuck yeah.

2289
02:19:25,010 --> 02:19:25,569
Let's do that.

2290
02:19:25,569 --> 02:19:27,090
Let's do that like in the next couple of days.

2291
02:19:30,209 --> 02:19:31,010
Yeah, yeah.

2292
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:35,659
No, fuck yeah.

2293
02:19:35,659 --> 02:19:36,620
Yeah, fuck yeah.

2294
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:44,540
All right, guys.

2295
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:45,840
Take care.

2296
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:48,049
See you tomorrow.

2297
02:19:48,049 --> 02:19:49,819
Get some sleep.

2298
02:19:49,819 --> 02:19:50,860
Talk to you soon.

2299
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:53,149
Ta-ta for now.
