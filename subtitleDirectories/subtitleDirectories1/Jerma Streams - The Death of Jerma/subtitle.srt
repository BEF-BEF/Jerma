1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:13,080
Hey, how's everybody doing? Hopefully pretty good. I'm just hanging out here.

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:24,489
Everybody, you have 20 minutes to live. Don't worry, I'm gonna be just fine.

3
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:48,600
Let me just change this over. Just tweeted it. It's pre-recorded, it's not. Look, I'm getting

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:57,189
ready here. I'm trying as hard as I can to get ready. These are resistant gloves. I've got,

5
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:08,040
I've got lots of padding. I've got lots of padding. I'm ready for a fucking meteor to hit.

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:31,239
Get the other one on. All right, we're good. But not yet. Pocky pads too. I think these are for

7
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:47,480
children because I don't think I've got the correct one that were for adults. I think it

8
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:56,780
actually says in the back that this is for people in the eighth grade. It's all right,

9
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:04,920
it's okay. It's just Velcro. I could have taken, all right, it does fit. It is for

10
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:14,520
an adult because I have the strap still on. Padding breached. Don't say that. So you got,

11
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,419
okay, so let me make sure I get this correct. Let me stand up. This is like, this is for a

12
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:25,879
meteor, right? Resistant gloves. I mean, this is, on the package it said it was for gardening.

13
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,870
But I mean, there could be some acid that I could come into contact with that I won't be

14
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:51,099
touching here. I got my padding. Should get this on too. Audio is out of sync. How so?

15
00:02:51,099 --> 00:03:01,990
Is it? It shouldn't be. Hello, hello, it's out of sync. This is my helmet to protect me from any

16
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:24,539
face related injuries. I feel like a Lego guy. No, hold on. I gotta like cover the logos.

17
00:03:25,340 --> 00:05:26,139
I didn't cover the logos. Just stay right there. Sorry, I just had to find these. I had

18
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:36,439
to find the scissors because this tape is wicked fucked up. It's stuck together. You see?

19
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:52,100
Why is it stuck together? It just give me the roles. Like, look at this. This is not even a joke.

20
00:05:52,100 --> 00:06:01,699
That works. No, it doesn't. Look at this. Why would you duct tape together? Duct tape.

21
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:16,980
Who thought of this idea? All right. Okay. There we go.

22
00:06:24,699 --> 00:07:24,939
No, it's gonna shoot back in. As you can see, I put foam padding all over my room to be

23
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:42,459
able to participate in. I got foam in the corner. See? I foam padded my room.

24
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:56,600
Nice feet, idiot. This is a stressful day for me. Oh, my feet are protected. That makes perfect

25
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:06,149
sense as to why you would just say that. Exposed feet. I didn't think that far ahead. I thought

26
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:23,209
about my chest. What time is it? I got, I got 13 minutes. Ah, god damn it. I slept in late

27
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:30,810
because the fucking 12 hour stream last night. Get the helmet. I will. I will. I'm gonna get

28
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:49,240
the helmet on, but I don't, I, it's got like a big logo on it. All right. Here we go. Beer,

29
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,970
me, username. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Let's just get this logo covered.

30
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:01,220
Thank you for the 10 community subs. Don't worry. We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it.

31
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,809
There we go. I just don't want anyone to see. I don't want company names and all that.

32
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:18,070
I don't want anyone to know what company name that is. You know, company names gotta get

33
00:09:18,070 --> 00:10:02,389
covered. There we go. Now I can put this on. See? We're good. I feel like I'm about to go

34
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:09,960
get a fucking massage. I hate this. See, I could like, I could like smash my head into something.

35
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:25,850
The straps gonna choke you. Don't say something like that. Uh oh. No variables. No variables

36
00:10:25,850 --> 00:11:00,500
allowed. None. Okay. Okay. Eye protection. Don't touch anything. They're not gonna put,

37
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,490
this hurts. How do people wear these? I would rather dodge the fucking shot of glass

38
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:14,659
that's gonna come through. No, I'll be all right. Cause now, okay, if like the ceiling

39
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:23,529
caves in, it's gonna hit me right in the crown of the head. This only protects my cheekbones

40
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:43,779
and my forehead. I got an exposed neck. Don't worry. I got like a plan. I don't have a plan.

41
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:58,019
I'm gonna have to like lie down. I'm gonna lie down over there. How's it back look? Pillows.

42
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:44,730
Hold on. Fucking idiot. One, two, three. I shouldn't have got the mail like this.

43
00:12:45,690 --> 00:13:24,460
It's not the right. I got it. Hold on. I feel like this is a doctor from like the 1600s.

44
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:50,460
All right. That's good. All right. I just look, I look like a nun. Crown of the head is covered.

45
00:13:50,460 --> 00:14:01,769
Head. Shoulders. Acid resistant gloves. What time is it? I got 10 minutes. Not even. You're

46
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:07,899
gonna die from overheating. It's, it's very cold outside right now. Don't worry. I've had

47
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:14,120
plenty of water. Protect my neck. I'm just gonna go like that. Don't worry. And I gotta

48
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:25,259
lie down. I gotta like lie the fuck down somewhere. I'm gonna have like red cheeks.

49
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:34,549
What if you need to pee? That's, it's just gonna happen. You know, it's just gonna happen.

50
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:42,139
Look, I have only 10 minutes until it's over. What about getting hit by a broom?

51
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,169
I'll grab it with my heat resistant hands. He's gotta pee. I don't have to pee right

52
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:58,730
now. I'm just fine. Why would I catch fire? I am completely protected from the elements.

53
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:13,370
Rain. Ceiling cave-in. Explosion. Cross check. You know what I mean? Bar soap falling down.

54
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:35,559
Acid. Oh, I got some, hold on. Shrists. Shrids. Shins. Wrists. I'm ready. And I'm gonna keep

55
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:40,440
my, I, but you don't see down here as I have survived two big foot cases that I'm sticking

56
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:52,840
them in right now. We got, all right. I need to relax. What do you think? Where's

57
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:00,340
a good spot? I'm thinking right here. It's out of the way again. It's in a variable.

58
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:13,929
Get the variables out of the way. Check the closet. Remember, always go fucking acid gloves first.

59
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:42,779
We're good. All right. Any like paint that could fall on me.

60
00:16:46,620 --> 00:17:01,350
I'm ready. We got like four minutes. God damn it, man. Getting fucking nervous now.

61
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,990
Feet. Feet. I told you I got, I got a thing to put my feet into in case something happens.

62
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:23,369
I was gonna stick them in here. Look, see? We're good. Seal the room. Fucked gas.

63
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:30,970
Toxic gas is gonna. I don't have enough time for this. I gotta get, I gotta go lie down.

64
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:38,789
No, I'm gonna lose my security deposit. I'm gonna, I'll be all right.

65
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:53,609
The door moved. The door didn't move. We're fine. All right. Okay. I gotta get,

66
00:17:53,609 --> 00:18:02,519
I gotta get in the position. Position, position, position, position. Which position?

67
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:14,710
And we're gonna have on like some very easy relaxing music. Relaxing music. Relaxing sleep

68
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:27,559
music. This is as good. Can I even hear it? Don't put anything in your ear. That's good.

69
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:42,059
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go. Here we go. Okay. Three minutes. Get out of the way. Right here.

70
00:18:42,059 --> 00:19:10,980
I'm gonna lie, just lie down. Okay. Right here. Protect acid hands. We good? Oh shit,

71
00:19:11,779 --> 00:21:49,619
what time is it? All right. All right. Nobody talk. I was relaxing. It was very relaxing. No.

72
00:21:50,500 --> 00:22:00,220
Wait, what? How do I get in? How do I get back inside? You gotta be kidding me.

73
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:23,380
Can you see me? Can anybody see me? Oh, come on. This is not even possible.

74
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:31,690
I had the headgear on. I had on, I got the special belt. I duct taped the house.

75
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:52,680
Can I click? I can't interact with any of this shit. Fuck.

76
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:29,500
Hey. Hey, wake up. Oh. Maybe I saw this in a movie once. This is my uniform that I wear when I'm a

77
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:36,299
ghost. The same shit that I had on is just no fucking fat suit. All right. Hold on a minute.

78
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:41,480
I saw Freaky Friday with Lindsay Lohan and I remember they did the same thing.

79
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:49,500
I just, I gotta jump in and think about all the fucking memories that I've ever had.

80
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,599
Right? Every memory I've ever had, I gotta make them all come out in one second. Here we go.

81
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:49,190
Baby. Well, it was a pretty, it was pretty good, I guess. Just make sure to, uh, anytime that you...

82
00:25:57,609 --> 00:27:01,220
It's great. I was in eighth grade. 440, 448. 448? I just put my head down. Was it four...

83
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:16,390
I was freaking out. Wait, are we still... Is that real? Four... I can't really see.

84
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:32,069
That doesn't make any sense. Can we confirm this is not a fucked up clock?

85
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:51,539
449. I just put my head down. I just, I literally... Holy shit. Well, there we are.

86
00:27:51,539 --> 00:28:08,950
I just put my head down for a second. Strange. Um, okay. I did it. I made it.

87
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:20,779
Thanos' head. Yeah, it was easy. Watch out what happens on January 23rd. You're gonna be in

88
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:28,579
trouble. Yeah. All this for no fucking reason. Unbelievable. I spent through, I go through all

89
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:41,619
the trouble. Turn that music off. We don't even need it. He's behind you. I was, I panicked. I

90
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:47,900
was freaking out for nothing. Sometimes I'll let you guys get to me, you know? Sometimes you guys

91
00:28:47,900 --> 00:29:02,519
come up with these fucking elaborate stories. How did this get on the ground? I may move my

92
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,940
chair back over here. I was pushed over. What is the after... What are you talking about?

93
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:18,329
I literally laid down right there. I blinked and I wanted to check the time. And that's

94
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:22,970
it. Like, I must have, maybe, I don't know. Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I was sitting here

95
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:39,259
and didn't realize it was like 445. Nice tattoos. Where? 7,000. Holy shit. There's

96
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:53,000
7,000 people here watching. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you all. So we're gonna, we're

97
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,369
gonna transition here. We're gonna, uh, I really thought this was only gonna be like

98
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:06,500
a 30 or 40 minute stream anyways, but I mean, we're gonna transition. What happened

99
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:26,920
in the eighth grade? What do you mean eighth grade? Finished Lifeline. I could hook up

100
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:35,190
Lifeline and we'd give it another go. You sneezed in the eighth... When did I sneeze?

101
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,250
All right, I gotta get out of this. Because I was in it for, what a fucking waste. I was

102
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,329
in it for no reason. I'll be back. I, let me get out of this and like fucking

103
00:30:44,329 --> 00:31:05,769
shake my hair. I'll be right back. We're gonna play Lifeline. What do you mean joke

104
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:17,180
incoming? No, I'm just, I'm taking off all this, like, fat suit padding. I just

105
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,900
don't want the camera on me. Hold on. I'll be back. I, I, give me, I got,

106
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,980
you're gonna have to give me, like, at least a few minutes here.
