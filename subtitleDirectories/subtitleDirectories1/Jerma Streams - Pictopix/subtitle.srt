1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:02,569
First thing I say when I look over here is,

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:11,099
Jeremiah, I'm so disappointed in you. Why? I didn't even have a chance to turn in my homework.

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:19,530
I just, okay, it was Saturday and Sunday went by. You were running school. You're the teacher.

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:26,410
I come into class. It's been, it's Saturday and Sunday. It's Monday morning at school.

5
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,329
I have my backpack. I've got my textbooks. I sit down in the seat at Math 103.

6
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,649
Teacher looks at me and goes, Jeremiah, I'm incredibly disappointed with you.

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,119
I didn't even have a chance to do anything. I just sat down. I was ready to learn.

8
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:59,210
30 months up. That's a long time. God damn, you guys are fast.

9
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:14,709
This is not going to be relaxing. Yes, it is. Imagine not being in Math 104 in 2019.

10
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,099
Back seating stream? No, it's not. I know what I'm doing in Picross.

11
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,510
By the way, sorry to disappoint all 10,000 of you that just came to the stream right now.

12
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,459
But today we're going to play Picross with Chad. This was a democracy. It was voted on.

13
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,019
I didn't pick this. I mean, I put, I made it available.

14
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:51,140
This was a pre-stream vote that came down to it.

15
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:59,049
And we're going to hang out and just relax. Everyone's going to be calm and collected.

16
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,469
We're going to do some Picross puzzles. We're going to hang out.

17
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,669
We're going to have, you know, resident sleeper waiting room for Sims 4 mods tomorrow.

18
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,110
I'm sure I'll see that a thousand times because that's what's happening tomorrow.

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,000
No, this is going to be fun. Look, I've had, the VR has been so intense

20
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:39,180
that I got to shut off for a little while. So I'm going to play Picross,

21
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:46,340
this Twitch integration. Are you really playing? Oh yeah, that's tomorrow.

22
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,099
There's a first-person mod for the Sims 4 that I want to try.

23
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,659
There's also a couple of other things that I have not enabled,

24
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:07,060
but I need to play first-person Sims. He's never going to play Seaman. Yes, I will.

25
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,099
Can you please beat the Abyss Watchers in Sims 4?

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,439
We don't talk about that stream. We, we bury that.

27
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:24,139
God, that's the most fucked up I've ever been.

28
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,659
That's the most, I was just like mentally fucking all over the place for that stream.

29
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:33,699
Puzzle streams will never be relaxing. Just you wait.

30
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,020
So I don't know what time it is where you are. I don't know what you're doing right now,

31
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:45,530
but you made it here. I'm going to take that opportunity to fill in squares on a grid.

32
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,090
I will explain it. I will tell you step-by-step instructions.

33
00:03:50,810 --> 00:04:03,240
So like get in bed with your iPhone or your iPad, scrunch your neck down and your chin into

34
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,319
your chest, lying on your back because that's fucking impossible. Can somebody please invent

35
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:14,900
something to watch TV in bed? And I'm not talking about one of those giant pillows you put with the

36
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,779
chair pillows. Why is there no device that attaches to your neck, like locks around your

37
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:29,540
neck like a collar and mechanically like lifts your fucking head up and there's like pulls it

38
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,139
up like out of its socket almost. And then there's a crane arm that has your iPhone or

39
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,300
your iPad attached to it up around like almost like a desk lamp in front of your face.

40
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:47,939
Hi, nobody's made that yet. You're yelling. This is supposed to be real. I'm sorry.

41
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,339
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're supposed to be chill. I don't know. Okay. Let me,

42
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:00,230
I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you a real reality of something that happened today.

43
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,629
Okay. I don't know why I did this, but this is real. This is not a joke.

44
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,449
Picross stream. I drank a 12 ounce of Red Bull before this stream and I don't fucking drink

45
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:23,019
that shit. I don't know why I decided to do that today. Forget about all the intent shit

46
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:28,779
that all the VR streams. No, today is the day that I decide to drink a fucking Red Bull.

47
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,389
That's not how you relax. It has, okay, it had Pac-Man on it. That's why I was like,

48
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:44,980
I have to drink this. I'm already like fucking, my hands are moving and stuff.

49
00:05:44,980 --> 00:06:02,310
I'm going to have to relax. I don't know why I did that. I don't know why, but I have no reason.

50
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,000
I just want to make sure everyone's very clear before I get started here.

51
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,649
Some of you might be expecting this. This is probably a joke. Oh, and that's like a funny

52
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:17,850
bit. Like what are we actually doing today? No, this is what we're doing today. I just

53
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:30,100
want to make that clear. I need that. I have to make that clear. There it is. You can tell

54
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,560
by the Super Mario blocks. Is there audio here? And again, I'm going to, I'm telling you,

55
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm going to go, shit, what did I just do? No, everybody relax. You know, don't make me do it.

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,519
I'll do it. We talked about it in the pre-stream chat. I'll do it. You guys that were here

57
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:16,060
before the stream started, you know what I'm talking about. I don't, don't test me here.

58
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,410
I'll put on four and a half hour slow mode. So you only get one message for the whole

59
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:37,899
stream. Yeah, I'm going to force you to relax. Two messages. Ah, that's right. That's right.

60
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:45,660
I'm automatically putting a limit here of a four and a half hour stream. I know nobody said that.

61
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,740
We're doing nobody photos for this. I had an extreme elimination, pre-stream elimination

62
00:07:51,740 --> 00:08:02,279
tournament. So let's, let's do it. Everybody just chill out. Welcome to the stream. And

63
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,379
if you're like, fuck this guy, see you tomorrow. That's fine. I'll see you tomorrow

64
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:13,449
for the Sims 4 mods. But no, I bet you this is, you know what, you know, I bet you this is going

65
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:21,269
to be one of my most viewed streams this year. Anyone want to raise their hand and take that

66
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:34,899
fucking auction? Cause I kind of don't. Anyways, so here we go. By the way, there is Twitch

67
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:46,730
integration and I don't know how it works yet. Let's see. Does it work? Big Bits just came

68
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:57,509
in right now from Great Canadian Fuck Club. Thank you Great Canadian for the $50. Appreciate

69
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:04,330
it. No, you can't. Don't get out of bed. Stay in bed. I'm getting a little heated right now.

70
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,330
I'm supposed to be relaxing. Great Canadian. Thank you so much. I'm not going to bed and you

71
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:18,649
can't make me dad. This Twitch integration. I don't know how it works. I think you can do

72
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:26,340
like exclamation point. Oh, I got to, but let's get through the tutorial. Let me explain

73
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,700
how this works. Okay. I don't need to read any of this shit down here. Cause I can tell you

74
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:39,879
how it works, but great Canadian. Thank you so much for the $50. All right. Relax everybody.

75
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:51,289
It's not cues. Ready? Let me explain how this works. As you said that I got out of my bed.

76
00:09:51,289 --> 00:10:03,860
All right. That's enough. All right. All right. All right. Everything relax.

77
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,110
How this I see the chat and I can't even fucking relax. It's hard to relax with this.

78
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:15,029
Like a bunch of fucking noises over here. Okay. So pick Ross guys, this is how this works.

79
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,690
You get a grid. It could be five by five. It could be 10 by 10 and people are,

80
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,090
this is Twitch integration right here. How'd you guys figure, how'd you guys do that?

81
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:39,429
Is this you guys down here? Why is it only two people? Yeah. You guys don't think I got a

82
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:49,299
secure password. That's fucking 86 characters long. Good luck. All right. Here you go. Here

83
00:10:49,299 --> 00:11:03,610
are your chat commands. I guess I can see them down there. Maybe you can check the commands.

84
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:09,610
Maybe. Oh Jesus. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a good,

85
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:16,309
this is not relaxing. This is spam. This is spam. This is not relaxing at all.

86
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:35,720
Anyways, let me, I'm not going to turn that off. All right. Don't before, no,

87
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,480
goodbye. All of you. Don't stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop with the

88
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,799
integration shit. It doesn't mean anything yet. Let me tell you how to play the game.

89
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,710
Okay. So you got a grid. It's a five by five grid.

90
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:07,289
Okay. You have a five by five grid. Stop it. Okay. I'm turning it off. No,

91
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:11,860
not six hour slow mode. Do it. Don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. I'm kidding.

92
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:18,200
So how you, you got a grid. There's numbers as you see on the top and on the left,

93
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,009
you know, this is for you guys, not for me. So the grid,

94
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:29,399
I can't relax. I can't do this. I'm such a fucked up person. I'm never going to be

95
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,690
able to do this stream. You understand? It's like, I'm fucking tied down in a chair right

96
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,289
now and I'm like turning into the Hulk and I just want to explode out of the chair.

97
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:51,659
All right. We're good. So what you have to do, what you have to do is like, no, no, no,

98
00:12:51,659 --> 00:13:00,649
no, no. That's not right. Okay. I need to relax. So the numbers corresponding on the,

99
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,929
I have to close the chat. I have to, I minimize the chat right now. I can't see

100
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:10,950
what you guys are saying. I would be so bad under pressure. I could never work for the CIA.

101
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,029
Okay. If I was working for the CIA and they had to like get me to say something or do something

102
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:19,990
or I was going to crack this, put up a fucking Twitch chat next to my face, ask me questions,

103
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,700
and then watch like the fail fishes and LULs that I see out of the corner of my eye.

104
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,019
I wouldn't be able to do it. I'd crack in a second. You could like rip my fingernails off

105
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,580
and I would be like, I'll never tell. I'll never talk motherfucker. You put like a

106
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,950
Twitch chat into the left of my eyes and they're doing LULs. I'll be like, okay, so,

107
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:45,590
okay. So, uh, are they laughing at me or, uh, okay. So, uh, the base is about at coordinates

108
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:58,220
four 95, but anyways, so you get a grid here. There are numbers at the top, numbers at the

109
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:05,720
left. You fill in squares. See how I'm doing this? Not that one. Not that one.

110
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,360
The numbers on the top and the left, this is how many squares you need to fill in,

111
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:15,820
in this column here. Same thing on this side. So there are five

112
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,620
squares that need to be filled in here and there's only five spaces. So deducing with

113
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,019
deduction technology, we've deduced that all five squares need to be filled in.

114
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:31,779
Take a look over here on the left. Only one square on this row needs to be filled in. And

115
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:34,820
guess what? It was filled in by us doing this five. We've logically deduced

116
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,269
that this is the only one. So therefore it is now grayed out. Take a look at over here.

117
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:47,669
This says zero. As you are well aware, zero means none. So there are no squares to fill in here.

118
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:54,840
Got it? So therefore there are three that need to be filled in here. There's one here already.

119
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:01,259
So guess what? One, two, three. That's where it goes. Notice how now we have our three.

120
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,419
We've deducted with our technological brains. Same thing here. See one and one. You're

121
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:11,259
probably asking, what the heck's going on with the two ones? Well, just relax. I'll tell

122
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:20,340
you. This means that there is a space of at least one square between these two numbers. So

123
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:26,340
as you see, we have one here. So this is one of the ones. It's probably the second one,

124
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,740
considering that this is already filled in. No more squares are allowed to be here.

125
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:38,470
So our one space one, there has to be at least one empty space. Same thing with this

126
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,519
one. So you got one, one solved our first puzzle. Now I can bring the chat back up so you know,

127
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,919
and that's F for the string, right? Everyone's going to like say F like rip string.

128
00:15:50,570 --> 00:16:03,590
Okay. So now we can bring the chat back. First thing I see is this is shit. Will you relax?

129
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,950
So now that you know how this works, let me show you how a master does it.

130
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:24,389
You didn't, did you even get to blink? That's a coffee cup. This game is called

131
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:38,059
PictoPix. You get the relaxing music. They get hard. They're not easy. I'll let you guys do one

132
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:44,730
in a minute. Don't worry. When do we get to start relaxing? You can right now. So remember,

133
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:57,509
we've got five here, five, five again. Just imagine you're at like a lounge. So here's

134
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:05,640
another thing. You can actually stop yourself from accidentally filling in squares. So see how

135
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,599
we're done here. I'm going to put some X's to make sure that I don't accidentally. Oh wait,

136
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:17,079
hold on a second. So I don't click down here. This is stressing me out. This shouldn't be

137
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:24,089
stressing you out at all. This should be relaxing. We had five community cubs just come in

138
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:32,420
from Fitty. Thank you, Fitty for the five community subs. It's not stressful. This

139
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,940
game was fun when I was in kindergarten. You didn't play this in kindergarten. I can

140
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,900
guarantee it. I 100% guarantee you did not play this in kindergarten. You weren't smart enough

141
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:52,549
for it. Look, that's like a, that's a fucking like Legend of Zelda sword. See, now we have

142
00:17:52,549 --> 00:18:04,490
some more spaces. It's getting more complicated. $100 just came in. Where? What are you talking

143
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,309
about? I'm not going to do this yet. You guys need to understand how the game is played

144
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:21,799
and I'm getting a vibe that you don't. It was $125 in gifted subs. Five tier. Wait,

145
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:29,430
those were tier three subs? Oh shit. I, okay. Those are, why would you give, why would you

146
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:37,940
give some tier three subs? Oh my God. Fitty gave five tier three subs. That's a shit

147
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,690
load of money. Well, congratulations to the people that got the tier three sub.

148
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:50,220
We know how to play idiot. That guy's not relaxing on what I'm permanently been.

149
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,299
Uh, thank you. That's fucking hot. Like what? Hundreds of dollars or something. 100 and like

150
00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:05,769
50, 200. How much money is that? Is this on steam? It is on steam. I think it's like,

151
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,380
they might be packs you have to buy. I'm making that up. I don't know, but it's like

152
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,740
seven bucks. You can also get these for free online, but this one had the Twitch

153
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,619
integration. So I was like, you know what, why don't I like ignore everybody down here

154
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:24,660
that's pressing buttons and you know, give it a try. So as you see, we've got the five

155
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,500
filled in here and we have our one. Now remember, I want you all to remember

156
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,609
you're not remembering. Excuse me. Listen, there has to be a space here.

157
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:48,410
I'm not relaxed. See three, one, this is the one. So therefore there has to be at least

158
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:54,180
one space between all of these. I'm trying. I know. I, I, I'm sorry. And look, take a

159
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,539
look here. What do you got? What's that? Zero five. There's only three spaces left.

160
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:04,069
So fill it in. Same thing with this one. Only three spaces left. Same with this one.

161
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:12,819
Only three spaces left. The one, one, one up here is already done. See one three,

162
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:18,779
but, but Jerma, I don't get it. If there's one and three, I see one, two, three. I don't

163
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,140
get it. No, no, no, no. Relax. This is one. There's your space. There it is. Therefore,

164
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,829
deduce with your brains. One, two, three. That has to be three in a row.

165
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:35,509
Bingo. Same thing over here. Right. What's the deal with this one? Can you guys help?

166
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:46,490
Can I get some help on this one? This one is the reverse of the other one. Take

167
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:55,829
a look at that. Has to be three space one. There it is. That's how many followers and subs I'm

168
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:16,230
going to lose a minute on this stream. You just didn't know. Do it yourself. Stupid. Sure.

169
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,599
I think a friend of mine has this tattooed on their chest and they think it means strength

170
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:45,960
in Chinese. I swear to God, that's not, I'm not making that up. It's not me. I don't

171
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,700
have any tattoos. What are you talking about? All right. Let's see. We got, let's use our

172
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,279
minds here. So, lock in. I'm not going to click these yet. Not until we get harder.

173
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,519
I'm going to have a panic attack. Well, relax because here comes a quick one.

174
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:09,700
We got, okay. So, nothing here. We got all one there. See? Same thing over here. Same thing here.

175
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,779
So, guess what? Has to be bingo. Bingo. That takes up the two. You got three. It's done.

176
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:36,220
Mind sweeper. This is not mind sweeper. Did it too slow. Who is this guy? My name is

177
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,660
Jerma. If you are a puzzle enthusiast, you may have found this stream because you're

178
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:45,180
like a puzzle enthusiast. I am too. And what we like to do in this stream is we check out

179
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:53,420
new puzzle games and we try new mind kind of brain training games. I do, I stream seven days

180
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,460
a week and I stream 10 hours a day and we do, we, I check out new mind brain training

181
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:05,559
exercises every day. Zero, right? Take a look. There's you four. Only can be four.

182
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:10,410
Now, wait a minute here. This is where it gets tricky because look at this.

183
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,670
Okay. So, how are we supposed to know what the heck's going on here? I'll tell you how

184
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:21,670
because see, there's a space here. It can't be here. It can't be here. This is the one.

185
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,589
So, there has to be a space. Two, you got it filled in. Guess what? The two is down here.

186
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:32,170
Has to be right there. And then your three spot is there. Your two spot is over here.

187
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:42,059
It's a baby. Yep. You must have been a cool substitute teacher. Nobody gets it. What

188
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:53,019
do you mean nobody gets it? No, there's no way. How do you not get it? You don't get it. Okay.

189
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:59,099
Like, I'll try it again. Let's, let's, let's, shh, relax. Some people don't get it. Ignores

190
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:07,720
the nice comment. Was there a nice comment? The nice comment was, was it the bits that just

191
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,160
came in? C4G, two, thanks for the 250. Canceled my last bits. I changed my mind

192
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:22,950
on the pit cross hype. That wasn't a nice message. I've never been less relaxed. Just

193
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,109
lean back in your chair. Go make popcorn or something. When was the last time you had

194
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:33,299
popcorn? Probably been a long time. No, I'm supposed to, I'm supposed to explain this to

195
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,140
people. Listen. Okay. Here you go. For those of you that have no idea what's going on,

196
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,660
welcome to the stream. My name is Jerma. I do puzzle games. I stream seven days a week,

197
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,140
10 hours a day. I've been at this for about 10 years now. I have my own puzzle

198
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,700
games that I make too. And they involve, you know, mind teasers, brain teasers,

199
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,299
and little twisties inside your head there. But for, what was that? I was like,

200
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:02,619
explain this. Okay. So, all right. Um, how do you, uh, okay. I got, I have to get the CIA

201
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:11,339
chat thing out of my way for a second. Okay. Good. All the material. I'd hit the fast forward

202
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:17,319
on this part. No, you wouldn't. You would sit here and watch it. All right. Listen, relax.

203
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,490
So pit cross is a game where this is a lie that people are trolling me. They know how

204
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,759
this works, but I'm going to do it again, just because a shitload of people did show up

205
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:37,539
after I started talking about it. Y'all fast forward, huh? Fast forward, fast forward,

206
00:25:37,539 --> 00:26:26,650
fast forward. Interesting. Okay. You want to fast forward? So what you are going to do

207
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:39,750
is when you take, I'm not really sure how to explain this, but you see all this channel,

208
00:26:39,750 --> 00:27:03,859
we are a puzzle enthusiast stream. And as you, is the voice changer working? No. Hold on. It's

209
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:33,690
not. Oh God. So what we do on this stream is we are a puzzle enthusiast. As you see here,

210
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:48,220
the five is five, one, two, three, four, five in a row. What you do is you pull it,

211
00:27:48,220 --> 00:28:06,599
each consecutive circle until the whole thing is filled. As you see there. Did I tell you

212
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:17,660
guys the funny thing that happened to me yesterday at the drive-through? Wow. You're going to laugh

213
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:36,250
so hard at me. So I'm in the drive-through and someone behind me decided to beep. I got out of

214
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:51,400
the car and got hit in the face with an ice cream. And after, do you guys understand this?

215
00:28:53,109 --> 00:29:30,099
I think I'm going to have to re-explain it. So as you see here. Yeah. How's that? Can you hear

216
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:43,900
me? Can you guys hear me? Fucking relax. So, but really though, sadly, yes, you take that

217
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:59,750
back right now or I'm going to anti-relax. I love how people are still doing this. I wish you were

218
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:06,180
mute. You don't actually wish that. Don't say something like that. You know, that hurts my

219
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,779
feelings when you say that. Think about it. You're talking to the streamer. Okay. I wish

220
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:36,309
the streamer was muted. Okay. You understand? Okay. Get a life. It's Minecraft cheese. Now,

221
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:41,240
you guys want to play? You guys want to play? Let's see if you've learned anything. Okay.

222
00:30:45,940 --> 00:31:03,539
Good luck. Let's see if you've learned a damn thing. Let's see. Okay. Good. Good. But no,

223
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:08,420
no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not good. You didn't do that right. You didn't deduce that

224
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:14,970
correctly. That's not correct. How would you know that this was here? One and one. All you

225
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,650
know is that one is in this row and one's in this column. You can't deduce that logically

226
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:31,109
here. Okay. Somebody gets it. Thankfully. Think about it here. What is absolutely,

227
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:47,799
completely yes. Okay. Something that you 100% know to be true. Three. Therefore,

228
00:31:49,319 --> 00:32:03,690
you have to have a space. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, that's true, but you had,

229
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:12,809
you had, oh no, that's right. Nevermind. I'll move back. What the hell was that? Why did

230
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:20,730
I just like spam a shitload of stuff? I just dumped like, why am I dumping shit in chat here?

231
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,140
I'm spamming the stream right now. Did you guys remove something? Yes. Very good.

232
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,460
Because see, notice how you got this one right. This one could not have been possible.

233
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,180
It's been doing that the whole stream.

234
00:32:45,940 --> 00:33:01,910
Careful here, guys. I don't think so about that. Think about this. Okay. The chat hurts

235
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:17,589
my eyes. You did a pretty good job. You deduced it pretty well. Nice work. You made

236
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:29,539
an anchor. Okay. Now it's my turn. Yes. These are still fairly simple. No, no, no, no. Auto play.

237
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,509
All right. So here we go. I'll show you one too. So let's take a look here. Remember,

238
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:44,009
you might be saying, oh boy, how am I going to do this? You're probably like

239
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:46,970
gnawing at your fingernails. They're just breaking off like cartoon, like

240
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,009
Rocco's modern life, just fucking flying everywhere when you move your

241
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:54,599
corn on the cobbing, your fingernails. Listen, relax. How you deduced this

242
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:01,049
is take a look. You got one, one, one, right? But I don't, I don't know. Just wait a minute.

243
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:11,369
Hold on. One space, one space, one. It fills in the whole entire. Now you do this.

244
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:19,989
If you, later on, it's going to be like 10, eight, 12, 15, four. They get huge. Count

245
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:27,429
these numbers here. One, two, three, right? How many spaces are in between here? At least

246
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:34,679
one, at least two. Therefore one, two, three, four, five. It has to fill the whole row.

247
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:45,050
We get it. No, you don't. At least 200 people have DMed me on Twitter and they're just like,

248
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,170
Jerma, I don't understand. Can you explain that the spaces thing again? I'm like,

249
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:57,190
I'm trying to help you. Two space, two. So now we have this completely deduced.

250
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,389
You can fill these in. We don't know exactly where these are, but we do because take a look

251
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:08,940
here. Two, two, two, two. It's as simple as that. Three, because it's got to be in the middle and

252
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:20,809
there you go. Bingo, bingo. This is second grade shit. We're warming up. Mom said it's my turn

253
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:33,769
on the pick, Ross. No, you're going to have to wait. One, three. Uh-huh. You got your three

254
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:46,900
here. You got your one, two. Can we stop the stream until everyone understands? No, we cannot.

255
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:59,880
Can we stop the stream until everyone? How am I supposed to decide if that's happening or not?

256
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,820
Can we stop the stream? No. Play binaural beats? No, you guys, you guys want to,

257
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:14,219
if you don't, if people don't start relaxing here, I'm going to play a like a 17 hertz

258
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:19,829
sound effect on, on YouTube. That's like the fear scary sound that makes you like,

259
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:36,980
like feel horrible. I will put that on full blast. All right. There you go. We got our

260
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:45,190
middle here. So we got two in here. We got one and one. So remember it can't be over on one

261
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,170
of these sides. And obviously these, the three has to be one, two, three, one, two, three,

262
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:57,500
has to be in the middle here. Play binaural beats. I'm not going to play binaural beats.

263
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:12,599
Why would I play binaural beats? It's going to hurt my head. I can't do binaural. Fine.

264
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:17,909
I'll try it. Not yet. In a minute. You need to relax. People are going to leave

265
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:35,420
because of that shit. That's like painful. Okay. So, uh, no, I fucked that whole thing up.

266
00:37:35,980 --> 00:38:01,079
It has to be three here. It's probably this. Fuck. This is easy. You guys are in my head.

267
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:19,320
I can do like 20 by 20 and I'm like fucked up now. I sit in bed and play this like three

268
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:51,059
nights a week at like 30 by 30 grid. I can say things that I can't prove too. Just wait.

269
00:38:51,059 --> 00:39:23,289
I like, I got lost. This is so easy. No, it can't be that. Why am I? I did like a 30 by 30

270
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:43,539
last night in preparation. He's pretending for views. I don't, I can't, I cannot believe that

271
00:39:43,539 --> 00:40:21,980
I can't do this. I can't relax. I can't do it. I seriously like, I don't know what it is.

272
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:29,530
I'll do the next one. I'll do the next 10 in 30 seconds each. I guarantee it. I fucking 100%

273
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:42,059
guarantee it. Like I, I don't know what happened. I got stuck in like a, I got stuck in like a

274
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:45,980
fucking tunnel and like traffic at work. My brain ran into itself like a thousand times

275
00:40:45,980 --> 00:41:00,630
because I had, I'm trying to just watch. Ready? Bingo. Say like, I don't know what the fuck

276
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,380
happened. I don't know what happened. I was pretending for views. Just pretend. Pretend I

277
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:28,389
was pretending for views. Honest to God, pretend I was just pretending. Derm of 12 D

278
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:32,619
chest. Yeah. I was pretending for views. I was trying to get some like views in here.

279
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:58,389
20 seconds left. I'm telling you, I'm fine. So let's see the down or up. It's down here.

280
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:07,670
Kind of has to be. And then one, one, it could be one, one. I know one, one. It's no, there

281
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:15,800
it is. So then here's your two, one. It can't be down there. You got two, one. And there's

282
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:26,389
your two, one. Lame stream guy acts like he's bad. It's so obvious that he's acting and his

283
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:38,119
fans still can't tell. Stop it. Now we get real. Okay. Forget about all the dumb shit

284
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:43,210
that just happened. I need to relax. I need to go drink another Red Bull and calm down.

285
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,940
There you see the Maka S. That's fine. We know we got zeros over here.

286
00:42:51,349 --> 00:43:01,000
This like fucking 1900s piano music I have to get rid of. No, no, not that. Just relax.

287
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,510
All right. So we got nine here. And those of you that are wondering, wait a minute,

288
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:17,690
this is a 10 by 10 grid. What the heck's going on here? Well, it's very simple. You just fill in

289
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,769
the ones that you know are certain, right? So for instance, this is zero. This is also zero,

290
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,570
making it a smaller, smaller area. So we know we only have to work in here.

291
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:34,489
Guess what? This has to be filled in here. Has to be. Because think about it, right?

292
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:39,690
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. One, two, three, four, five, six,

293
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:46,309
seven, eight, nine. These have to be filled in. I don't know if it's here yet or I don't know

294
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:50,539
if it's here yet, but we're going to try to deduce that. Anyways, we've got one, one.

295
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,380
Those of you that know, we've got the spaces here so we can mark and make sure we know that

296
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,340
we don't have to touch these because there has to be a space either here or here.

297
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:03,699
This is done. And so is this one. Pretty cool shit. You know what I mean?

298
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:11,420
So take a look here. Guess what? Four, one, two, three. Doesn't work there,

299
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:20,550
but guess what works here? One, two, three, four. Oh, I see. It's a penis. It's not a penis.

300
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:26,949
If it is, I will, if this is a penis, I will give a thousand community subs to myself,

301
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:39,000
but it has to say penis, like penis. A thousand community subs. I'm hoping there's

302
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
not something like developer troll in here because that would be bad. Anyways, so we've

303
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:56,780
got three this way, two already filled in, four this way as well. So two, we can't figure this

304
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,059
out yet. Four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four could be in either one of these

305
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:07,179
spaces, but it's not because look here, see two, that doesn't work because it has to be,

306
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:12,539
has to be here because that's impossible for it to be anywhere else. Four now is absolutely

307
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:19,030
has to be down there. Got the three already done now. Let's take a look at that. Four

308
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:24,199
has to be two in a row. So it could be either here. It's not here because there's the three

309
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,619
and then look at this perfectly lined up. Don't you just love that fucking satisfying,

310
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:45,590
hyper satisfying one, two, it's all it could be. No, it's not. Yes, it is. Wait, what? This,

311
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:57,159
this has to be here. Oh, fuck. It's not satisfying. What did we go wrong? What did I,

312
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:09,260
hold on. What did I go wrong? This has to be there. Oh, okay. Okay. No, I got it. No,

313
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:14,329
no, no, no. It's just so, it's hyper satisfying when you get it. Now we've got two.

314
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:22,519
So this is filled in. So there's your two and nine has to be there. No, nine has to be here.

315
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,710
Imagine being this smart. Imagine never being able to speak in my channel ever again,

316
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:49,190
as of right now mods, you know what to do. Power, power, power, power, power, power.

317
00:46:50,070 --> 00:47:01,880
All right. I almost just passed out. Relax. Play mind show. No, I'm taking a VR break.

318
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,559
I didn't even tell you the story of what happened when I got done with VR. Did I

319
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:11,460
tell you this? What happened here? You know, the reason why I'm not doing VR

320
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:21,000
is because my skin was peeling off. Last night, the skin on my forehead, if I rubbed

321
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:32,329
gently, skin was coming off of my forehead. I have to stop playing VR for a little while.

322
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:42,550
That's normal. Yeah. Is it though? I don't think so. It's laying eggs in my head. Skin peeling off

323
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:48,920
my forehead. Yeah. The valve is laying fucking half, half eggs in my head. All right, let's go.

324
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:55,960
So we got some two, two, one. Let's see. Two space, one space. Okay. So the two definitely

325
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:06,059
has to be here because it's impossible to be here. So the two has to be there. Moisturize

326
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:12,059
more and clean your headset. I clean my headset every time. You know how much I clean

327
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:20,789
that headset every single time. All right, so it has to be one here somewhere. One, two, three,

328
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:27,099
four. One, two, three, four. So it has to be here. All right, in the middle there.

329
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,840
Don't know if it's up or down. We got a two and a two. We got a one.

330
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:39,739
Didn't he say, didn't he moisturize? I moisturize every day. If you don't moisturize

331
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:46,489
every day, you got, I mean, you kind of have some issues there. You have to moisturize.

332
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:51,079
All right, I deduced it had to be here because there's no way you can do four down

333
00:48:51,079 --> 00:49:00,119
here. So there's your two. The whole bottom is done. So we got two here though. Do we get to play

334
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:12,039
it? You guys can do the next one. All right, we got two, maybe this way. There's also one,

335
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:20,489
one and two are here. So two has to be one, two space, one. I want to play. You can play

336
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:28,150
a minute. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. So we got one, two, three, four.

337
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:37,690
One, two, three, four. Okay, there's your one and your one. There's your two. So that leaves

338
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:52,679
us with a one and with them. That's not right. Not right. Not right. How do I undo? Why are you

339
00:49:52,679 --> 00:50:05,909
guys doing question marks? Now I can see because it's one, two, three, four. One, two, three,

340
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:11,670
four. It has to be these two. The four has to be in these two spots. It has to be.

341
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:22,739
It's impossible for it not to be. And that's one space, two, two. This is correct.

342
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:30,730
So then maybe this is wrong. Oh, let me just see what it looks like here.

343
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:40,090
Four. No, that's correct. It has to be there. So then, yeah, this has to be over this way.

344
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:46,119
There's no way. Yeah, that's correct. What did I... I fucked up something somehow.

345
00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:12,809
Yeah, that has to be. Ah, shit. Where the fuck is this then? How do I fuck that up?

346
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:29,530
So maybe it has to be here. But then what the fuck happens here? No, I'll go back a little

347
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:34,809
bit. I fucked it up somewhere in the very beginning. This is... How do I restart it?

348
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:38,170
Let me just restart it. Yeah, restart it. Restart it. I need to look at it again.

349
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,500
Because, yeah, I don't know what the hell I screwed up in the beginning here.

350
00:51:52,260 --> 00:52:04,420
Okay. So, yeah, one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Okay. There's your two and

351
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:18,539
your two. Okay, that's what I fucked up. That's what fucked up in the beginning. You're

352
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:35,500
doing a bad job, not gonna lie. Sorry, you can be banned for life too. So one, two, one,

353
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:42,900
two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Has to be here. One, two, three, four. One, two, three,

354
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:58,940
four. One, two, three, four. So then two can go either way. Can I be banned too?

355
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,659
Depends. Is there anything that you'd like to say about how stupid I am?

356
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:12,170
Huh? Anything else you'd like to say? Anything else you want to add?

357
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:20,820
You're doing a great job, not gonna lie. Thank you. Now the one thing about Picross that's

358
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:26,789
if you mess up one tile, it throws your whole brain off. That's why I'm trying to... Once you

359
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:35,239
like see it, you're like, oh fuck, okay, now I get it. It has to be in here somewhere.

360
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:44,710
So this was one. If one was here, then it has to be here. Because what are you gonna do?

361
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:49,559
One and then two? No, that doesn't work. Has to be right there. Now the one on the other hand,

362
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:56,489
I don't know. Same thing with this one. This is one, two, two. So it could be two. Yeah,

363
00:53:56,489 --> 00:54:02,739
has to be that. Or it could be here. Only knows that one's down here and that's it for this.

364
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:10,059
So this is where I fucked up last time. This is correct. Because this is the only way this

365
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:20,170
can work. You know why? It's because I think for some reason this was the same thing.

366
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:24,389
I thought it was one, one, two, one, one, two. That's what happened last time. What's with all

367
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:35,909
the question marks? Why? What did I do? I'm getting like a shitload of question marks.

368
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:46,900
Okay, so two, two has to be two, two. There can't be anything else.

369
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:59,349
That leaves us with one, one, two. This is done. No, it's not. Shit. What am I doing

370
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:19,909
wrong here? It can't be anything else. One, one, two, one, two, one. It's not that. Am I

371
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:27,980
actually reading this wrong? How? One, one, two, one, two, two. These two are right. They're

372
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:40,099
absolutely correct. So this has to be filled in like this then because this is the only

373
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:55,099
place I can be. I fucked it all up somehow. Okay, there we go. There's the other two

374
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:00,860
and there's the four. All right. It was it's a question. That's why everybody's doing question

375
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:09,420
mark. That's why you're doing that. Now I understand. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's why

376
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:19,900
everyone was doing that. Oh, oh, rely. Oh, I thought everyone was being just mean

377
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:24,300
and being like question mark. Holy shit. Is he this dumb? Just wait.

378
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:28,139
Seven, two, there are seven, eight, nine, ten. So it's going to be one, two, three,

379
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:37,030
four, five, six, seven, space two. Same deal right here. Let's see five, six, seven, eight,

380
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:44,780
nine. Not quite enough, but we got one, two, three, four, five, six. Same thing right here.

381
00:56:46,219 --> 00:56:54,730
Okay, cool. That leads us to here. So these are done. Two, that's done. And two is done.

382
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,820
I think we pretty much already figured this whole thing out because three has to be

383
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:11,059
right here. Five is one, two three, four, five. This whole top section is done. Two and then two,

384
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:15,780
look at where it has to be. Take a look. That's done. Four has to be right here. One,

385
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:21,210
two, three, four, five. One, one, one one three. It's a key. It's a penis key.

386
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:38,010
turn off hints you're embarrassing yourself what hints turn off hints oh

387
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:45,889

00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:54,809
this is one two three four five six seven easy enough then that completes

403
00:59:54,809 --> 01:00:00,119

01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:09,920
two two close this down pretty cool close this one down as well and we got

405
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:17,570
one two three four five six nice this one is done too leave this with four we

406

623
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:14,090
where that is though what's with you and shitting tonight it's not me okay

624
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:20,159
it's you guys that have this issue you guys telling me to play the brown

625
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:23,920
noise you guys telling me to go like poo my pants and stuff I don't know

626
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:29,989
what you guys are on tonight but it's not me I'm just reacting to it

627
01:36:29,989 --> 01:36:35,220
because I'm looking over and I'm like what is going on over here it's

628
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:48,449
cuz you drank a Red Bull I know no it's not I didn't drink anything now he's

629
01:36:48,449 --> 01:37:05,060
flipping us off all right let me finish this so I get five right here good

630
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:17,619
three it's done my question is one I still don't have this one somehow you

631
01:37:17,619 --> 01:37:22,859
three here let's see one two three four five yeah it's probably these two

632
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:26,060
because it can't really no I could be any one of these they're all five

633
01:37:26,619 --> 01:37:50,239
this is two five where's that one over here probably yes well how you can what

634
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:58,680
what's the hashtag guess mmm it could be either one of these because it's

635
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:08,239
two is one and then two one two three one two well it has to be one of

636
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:13,560
these so that's this one one two three four five block it off got it so

637
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:20,029
this has to be two here done therefore that's one two three four five

638
01:38:20,029 --> 01:38:25,390
therefore that has to be like that therefore here's your one there's your

639
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:35,079
two in theory that makes two as well there's your one which makes that

640
01:38:35,079 --> 01:38:52,710
three which then turns into here it's a grenade I'm gonna get bigger we're

641
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:57,850
getting close how was my day my day's been pretty good how was your day

642
01:38:57,850 --> 01:39:02,170

725
01:52:35,640 --> 01:53:03,140
the controls now German stocks are way down too I saw that by low they're

726

734
01:53:53,869 --> 01:54:03,989
p-cross in Sudoku Sudoku is nine grids this is a much larger scale and this

735
01:54:03,989 --> 01:54:11,479
is more about making a picture than solving a math problem I don't really

736
01:54:11,479 --> 01:54:20,140
play Sudoku but I think they're yeah they're very different it feels odd

Facebook fake news bullshit did I just that just that just happened

808
02:11:46,340 --> 02:12:06,800
holy shit did I actually just fall for like the Ronald Reagan used to wear

809
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:10,720
hats because he had devil horns and that's why he always wore hats to press

810
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:22,659
conferences so all right is it did I fall for that Jimmy Carter was four

811
02:12:22,659 --> 02:12:25,939
feet tall what you don't understand is he was on stilts during press

812
02:12:25,939 --> 02:12:40,250
conferences and they've like zoom it I fell for it okay the VR is real

813
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:45,859
well I can't wait to drink on stream again and everybody be concerned

814
02:12:45,899 --> 02:12:50,260

815
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:56,029
looking forward to it but you got this stream so you got some competition this

912
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:21,879
McDonald's that is written in like the fucking food Bible somewhere sell

913
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:29,829
out no that's that's just written in the food Bible of fast food the cheesy

914
02:32:29,829 --> 02:32:33,450
gordita crunch is the best single food item you can possibly order from a

915
02:32:33,450 --> 02:32:39,760
fast food restaurant that's just true I don't have to be sold out for that

916
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:48,620
but that's a good ghostbusters is the best movie ever made I don't need

917
02:32:48,620 --> 02:32:57,459
to tell you that you already know that everybody does and gremlins 2 is

918
02:32:57,459 --> 02:33:02,860

02:33:12,219 --> 02:33:21,770
block these two off for now back to the future three was the best movie

921
02:33:21,770 --> 02:33:31,110
uh his thing about opinions though you know his thing about opinions

922
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:36,940

924
02:33:57,540 --> 02:34:04,959
Blart ball cup is actually I didn't hate that movie I've never seen it

200 IQ strat yeah I use them I only like to use the X's when I'm certain

931
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:25,270
though because I don't like it throws me off if I use them too much because

932
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:28,350
I didn't like I would use them here but I don't know it could be six and

1006
02:48:39,959 --> 02:48:55,569
other one so one okay hold on don't freak out here six two I sound very

1007
02:48:55,569 --> 02:49:07,270
unhealthy what unhealthy what are you talking about how can you sound

1008
02:49:07,270 --> 02:49:15,649
unhealthy these are probably the ones right because then two would be here

1009
02:49:15,649 --> 02:49:28,590
I'm gonna just do an educated guesser that would make sense to it wouldn't be

1010
02:49:28,590 --> 02:49:48,700
this that's not even a guess that has to be that way whatever or could be no

1011
02:49:48,700 --> 02:49:55,639
well it definitely is not this way no it could be shit all right let me slow

1012
02:49:55,639 --> 02:50:03,059
down slow down slow down I can get this one here this is one one one

1013
02:50:03,059 --> 02:50:09,040
this two where the fuck would this be two going down which means two across

1014
02:50:09,239 --> 02:50:14,850
I don't have enough information I don't have the audio acts critical information

1015
02:50:14,850 --> 02:50:56,079
right that's tough well his three okay I see it I saw it I know somebody was

1016
02:50:56,079 --> 02:51:05,600
yelling at me now here's the real question where's the two you know

1017
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:09,520
what I'm saying it could be three this way or three that way it could be

1018
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:19,829
four this way or four this way hmm well it has to be here one of

1019
02:51:19,870 --> 02:51:46,329
these squares is this one I'm screaming into my monitor no I'm gonna accept no

1020
02:51:46,329 --> 02:51:49,569
I'm not doing this I don't want to do the maybe it's too much more

1021
02:51:49,569 --> 02:52:13,719
information I already know well this is three could this be two and then

1022
02:52:13,719 --> 02:52:20,120
one it's very possible but this is one could this could be one and then

1023
02:52:20,719 --> 02:52:39,299
this is one one two three whoa three one two one so therefore nope nope nope

1024
02:52:39,299 --> 02:52:44,559
don't need any of these so it's one of these two bring it down here this is

1084
03:03:13,280 --> 03:03:18,479
and then I'm the reason I'm the reason why you did better on your math

1085
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:21,799
test in like two weeks and I want you to write at the top of that paper

1086
03:03:21,799 --> 03:03:26,639
you can write your name I would put my name in there too at the top let's

1087
03:03:26,639 --> 03:03:32,280
say your name is Greg Anderson I want you to dash Jeremy Albertson because I

1088
03:03:32,280 --> 03:03:49,840
did it too I helped you do that all right to pause the stream and you go

1089
03:03:49,840 --> 03:03:54,979
get a band-aid what happened what happened what do you mean to get a

1090
03:03:54,979 --> 03:04:13,120
band-aid that's not enough information what happened no you

1091
03:04:13,120 --> 03:04:17,639
probably like just cut his finger on like a toy now what kind of toy

1092
03:04:17,639 --> 03:04:20,959
would that be if you could cut your finger on a toy nothing would get

1093
03:04:20,959 --> 03:04:30,920
recalled is it a toy do we need to get a recall he stepped on a Lego on him

1094
03:04:30,920 --> 03:04:37,719
and threw his foot it's embedded into him all right four five six seven eight

1095
03:04:37,719 --> 03:04:52,639
nine that's not enough resident sleeper resident sleep

1096
03:04:53,079 --> 03:05:02,420
resident sleeper is seriously like so offensive to every stream any stream

1097
03:05:02,420 --> 03:05:04,420
think about how like I want you to think about this for a second but

1098
03:05:05,260 --> 03:05:12,110
like fail fish whatever like he sucks at the game like oh ha ha I made like a

1099
03:05:12,110 --> 03:05:15,270
dumb joke and I didn't think it was funny he's like yeah I was cringy

1100
03:05:15,270 --> 03:05:20,829
resident sleeper means this is so bad I'm falling asleep because this is

1101
03:05:20,829 --> 03:05:28,139
so boring to me that I can't stand it anymore at least you're paying

1102
03:05:28,139 --> 03:05:32,180
attention when you write some of the other ones resident sleeper is

1103
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:36,819
like holy shit this sucks so bad that I'm going to bed good night I'm

1104
03:05:36,819 --> 03:05:52,690
not even watching anymore and it's in my title yeah all right it's fine all

1105
03:05:52,690 --> 03:06:01,979
right I got one four two two four five six seven eight nine I don't know I

1106
03:06:01,979 --> 03:06:10,739
know I don't know where to start with this one I don't have much to go on

1107
03:06:10,739 --> 03:06:19,420
here this is better than the Wow stream that the Wow stream was the

1108
03:06:19,420 --> 03:06:26,120
lowest point of my entire life that that single Wow stream was the lowest

1109
03:06:26,120 --> 03:06:32,479
single point in the history of my entire adult life but you guys know

1110
03:06:32,520 --> 03:06:37,319
when that stream turned off I smashed everything in my desk I broke every

1111
03:06:37,319 --> 03:06:41,559
monitor I broke all the controllers in here I broke all the glass I put holes

1112
03:06:41,559 --> 03:06:45,940
in all it was like a $16,000 repair job you guys don't know that that

1113
03:06:45,940 --> 03:06:56,270
happened I don't know where this next one goes so that's why I'm stalling

1114
03:06:56,270 --> 03:07:06,340
what will you do after this stream nothing because I'm have this is the

1115
03:07:06,340 --> 03:07:08,780
last dream was fine there was nothing wrong with the Wow stream it

1116
03:07:08,780 --> 03:07:15,270
was fun where does one of these go I've got only one piece of info here

1117
03:07:15,270 --> 03:07:20,469
one one I guess this could be one it has to be so this is one of the ones

1118
03:07:20,469 --> 03:07:33,879
also one of the ones two all I don't know if it's one of the ones four five

1119
03:07:33,879 --> 03:07:43,680
six seven eight nine it's not enough to fill one two three four one no I

1120
03:07:43,680 --> 03:07:48,399
guess it could be but I don't know that though because it could it might

1121
03:07:48,399 --> 03:07:53,860
not be there it's either like that or it's like this I don't have the

1122
03:07:53,860 --> 03:08:04,069
data I can do this though I started drinking in hopes of finding something

1123
03:08:04,069 --> 03:08:26,840
with humor in this string because this is to somewhere so I can go like this

1124
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:32,979
because it has to be somewhere in here same thing with this one it has to be

1125
03:08:32,979 --> 03:08:41,520
one of these two so I can go like this okay go back to Floyd and

1126
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:46,979
brothers I blended that disc up and stirred it up with my coffee and

1176
03:19:48,879 --> 03:19:55,799
I let it sit in there cold frozen until the 98.6 degrees temperature at

1177
03:19:55,799 --> 03:19:59,280
Fahrenheit in my mouth warmed it up to a point where I could swallow it

1178
03:19:59,280 --> 03:20:05,370
and I could I kind of like mash it and mush it around in my mouth a

1179

03:20:26,239 --> 03:20:32,680
curry I don't know 98.6 degrees in mouth that's not natural Fahrenheit

1181
03:20:32,680 --> 03:20:50,399
yes it is 97.5 to like 99 is normal derma 98.6 okay okay okay five six

1182
03:20:50,399 --> 03:21:02,959
seven eight nine I don't have info I don't have any fucking info one have

1183
03:21:02,959 --> 03:21:20,530
this I don't have any info for this I just don't I could I could try to

1184
03:21:20,530 --> 03:21:25,090
determine this so that's the room two three one two three four five is one

1185
03:21:25,090 --> 03:21:32,940
off one two three four five mmm it's probably in here let's see one two

1186
03:21:32,940 --> 03:21:48,180
three or one two three one two three I think I got the three you know for

1187
03:21:48,180 --> 03:21:54,139
the longest time I thought that that emote was the Vinnie's Zelda emote I

1188
03:21:54,139 --> 03:22:00,840
thought it was somebody throwing up into their hand and then I was like oh

1189
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:19,860
no that's from that cartoon that's from the Phillips CDI game right all

1190
03:22:19,860 --> 03:22:25,319
right come on no that's not Kim texting me back that's like it's like

1191
03:22:25,319 --> 03:22:39,500
my fucking I never mind somebody help me here you're so bored you're

1192
03:22:39,500 --> 03:22:54,329
looking for emotes for fun I am NOT bored I'm just stuck I'm just stuck one two

1193
03:22:54,329 --> 03:23:03,860
three four five one two three I guess it could be here in seven one two three

1194
03:23:03,860 --> 03:23:13,639
four five six seven one two three four five six seven three five two three

1195
03:23:13,639 --> 03:23:40,479
damn it three four five six seven one could be anywhere over here one two

1196
03:23:40,479 --> 03:23:45,040
three four five six seven it could be anywhere the one could be literally any

1197
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:51,950
of these because this is three and this is also three so it could be either one

1198
03:23:51,950 --> 03:24:07,200
yeah the one can only be here the question is it's I can't I can't

1199
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:14,799
determine which one it is so therefore one two three four five six seven one

1200
03:24:14,799 --> 03:24:25,819
two three four five six seven doesn't really help me though filling most of

1201
03:24:25,819 --> 03:24:42,969
the seven I'm doing it play English lessons no no no can I teach you how to

1202
03:24:42,969 --> 03:24:46,090
play the game yeah three five one three one three one three one one three two

1203
03:24:46,090 --> 03:24:48,969
five three three one three three one two three four five six seven eight nine

1204
03:24:48,969 --> 03:24:54,409
ten J I H G F E D C B A three five three ten one seven three one two

1205
03:24:54,409 --> 03:25:00,959
three one three one two two one one it's that simple I have to start

1206
03:25:00,959 --> 03:25:17,870
guessing the stream is just a looping back on itself oh hey how'd they go bye

1207
03:25:17,870 --> 03:25:26,309
you don't welcome to the stream all right so we got one two three or one

1208
03:25:26,309 --> 03:25:34,770
two three therefore goodbye no no no no no no no no no no no no no no because

1209
03:25:34,770 --> 03:25:39,850
it has to be either one two three or one two three therefore I think it's

1210
03:25:39,850 --> 03:25:47,450
impossible same on this side because there's no way this three can come up

1211
03:25:47,450 --> 03:25:54,959
this way it's either here here or here I don't have info for down here yet

1212
03:25:54,959 --> 03:26:14,959
brown car note is he finally using crosses I've been using crosses the

1213
03:26:14,959 --> 03:26:23,629
whole time what I've been using these the entire time almost four hours of

1214
03:26:23,629 --> 03:26:26,069
resident sleep or it doesn't even feel like it's been in doubt by the

1215
03:26:26,069 --> 03:26:30,850
way three and a half you're adding time you're adding a like a 40

1216
03:26:30,850 --> 03:26:33,809
minutes of time to make it seem like it's been more boring but it's

1217
03:26:33,809 --> 03:26:37,530
been three eight hours and 27 minutes three hours and ten minutes probably in

1218
03:26:37,530 --> 03:26:48,770
the game you added an extra 45 minutes how is that fair it's called rounding

1219
03:26:48,770 --> 03:26:54,600
up three hours and 27 minutes as you round that up to four no you round that

1220
03:26:54,600 --> 03:27:03,450
down to three three hours and 31 minutes round up the music is bad I'll

1221
03:27:03,450 --> 03:27:10,600
change the music well that make you guys happy he's there the music the

1222
03:27:10,600 --> 03:27:27,399
music is kind of round to the nearest hour okay how about I'm not

1223
03:27:27,399 --> 03:27:32,930
gonna play the brown note look this thing says warning the real brown note

it's i mean it's just that's a song that's part of the jojo's universe

1332
03:49:49,260 --> 03:49:55,440
you know steven's universe whatever it's called jojo and steven going a

1333
03:49:55,440 --> 03:50:16,590
bizarre adventure in their universe steven's bizarre adventure i've

1334

03:50:19,790 --> 03:50:33,020
but i've never seen it i can't believe he's still on this level

1336
03:50:33,020 --> 03:50:52,500
because we had to take a break two three four five six

1337
03:50:52,500 --> 03:50:55,780
and one and then a space and a two and a three

1338
03:50:55,780 --> 03:51:10,379

03:51:10,379 --> 03:51:13,579
dude dial-up noises why are you guys trying to like make me

1340
03:51:13,579 --> 03:51:23,620
like my brain exhausted i'm gonna guess that that's a

1341
03:51:23,620 --> 03:51:30,639
a one hey i got an idea you know the really really grating awful

1342
03:51:30,639 --> 03:51:35,819
like burn your head sound play that just play it

1343
03:51:35,819 --> 03:51:39,739
crazy frog i did crazy frog and beat saber and 100

1344
03:51:39,739 --> 03:51:56,459
expert of level fill in the middle two rows with six yeah but i

1345
03:51:56,459 --> 03:52:01,680
don't know which way they go i could do like let's say one two

1346
03:52:01,680 --> 03:52:06,719
three four for now one one two three four five six

1347
03:52:06,719 --> 03:52:11,649
let's just say there's a one here one two three four five six

1348
03:52:11,649 --> 03:52:16,159
you just assume you know you assume the dealer has a face card right

1349
03:52:16,159 --> 03:52:23,020
so one two three four five six one two three four five six do the same thing

1350
03:52:23,020 --> 03:52:31,229
over here there's the two don't have the three

1351
03:52:31,229 --> 03:52:46,530

1355
03:53:17,579 --> 03:53:23,700

04:17:49,139 --> 04:17:52,979
five six seven one two three four five six seven

1494

four two seven right in the middle there okay

1502
04:19:03,870 --> 04:19:20,750
is this minesweeper not quite six let's see one two three four five

1503
04:19:20,750 --> 04:19:34,420
no one two three four five it's probably one of these two

1504
04:19:34,420 --> 04:19:38,500
three let's see one two three one two three so this is all

1505
04:19:38,500 --> 04:19:44,860
bullshit same with this say one two three four

1506
04:19:44,860 --> 04:19:51,940
one two three one two three four so this is all bullshit up here one

1507
04:19:51,940 --> 04:19:56,739
two three four five one two three four five one two

1508
04:19:56,739 --> 04:20:03,680
three four five all bullshit no wait one two three four five

1509
04:20:03,680 --> 04:20:07,040
one two three four five what's wrong with my voice

1510
04:20:07,040 --> 04:20:19,709
okay three going up and down three going up and down again but i don't

1511
04:20:19,709 --> 04:20:23,709
know if it's connected to here it might be one two three four five

1512
04:20:23,709 --> 04:20:33,790
six seven no i can't tell six is though it's

1513
04:20:33,790 --> 04:20:40,540
possible one two three four one two three four therefore all

1514
04:20:40,540 --> 04:20:48,299
this is dog shit one two three four five six one two

1515
04:20:48,299 --> 04:20:51,899
three four five six all this is dog shit

1516
04:20:51,899 --> 04:21:09,899
derma sucks well everybody's got an opinion you know

1517
04:21:09,899 --> 04:21:15,010
four two can't tell i don't have any info yet

1518
04:21:15,010 --> 04:21:27,739
two and then two let's think about this for a second

1519
04:21:27,739 --> 04:21:33,260
five one two three four five one two three four five

1520
04:21:33,260 --> 04:21:40,690
that's right one two three four five one two three four five that's correct

1521
04:21:40,690 --> 04:21:43,979
then here's the real issue is this part of the four

1522
04:21:43,979 --> 04:22:04,530
or is this four and this two one two three four

1523
04:22:04,530 --> 04:22:13,489
one two three four okay is that part of the four or is this four too

1524
04:22:13,489 --> 04:22:24,299
i don't know you should try the quit puzzle game i'm not gonna do that one

1525
04:22:24,299 --> 04:22:29,180
two three four five six one two three four five six

1526
04:22:29,180 --> 04:22:35,790
that makes sense which means three four

1527
04:22:35,790 --> 04:22:40,350
one two three four one two three four

1528
04:22:40,350 --> 04:22:45,889
one two three four one two three four it's not there

1529
04:22:45,889 --> 04:23:03,389
damn it one two three one two three it's not here

1530
04:23:03,389 --> 04:23:25,489
one two three one okay nice two three seven there's the six

1531
04:23:25,489 --> 04:23:28,450
six again okay there's the four the two

1532
04:23:28,450 --> 04:23:37,620
oh it's just cascades like a domino that's what you say

1533
04:23:37,620 --> 04:23:45,219
chill out dude it's an accessory you guys are guessing animals

1534
04:23:45,219 --> 04:23:52,190
it's not it's not a this is not a whale

1535
04:23:52,190 --> 04:23:55,549
well it's got to be here or here therefore none of this works

1536
04:23:55,549 --> 04:24:14,459
one two three one two three four that's it for three

1537
04:24:14,459 --> 04:24:17,659
i don't like men under five feet sorry well that's great because i'm

1538
04:24:17,659 --> 04:24:22,319
five eight so no that's not true here no no no no no no no no i'm talking

1539
04:24:22,319 --> 04:24:27,920
about like this that's not real this is not going to work for none

1540
04:24:27,920 --> 04:24:33,780
of five feet

1541
04:24:44,959 --> 04:24:48,959
one two three one two three can't be here

1542
04:24:51,420 --> 04:24:56,670
two i'm gonna i know what this i'm gonna guess i think this is a

1543
04:24:56,670 --> 04:25:03,459
pipe a smoking pipe jerma only reads mean comments so we feel bad and give him

1544
04:25:03,459 --> 04:25:11,709
money one two three one two three can't be here

1545
04:25:11,709 --> 04:25:27,500
what is this two two three four five six one two three four five six perfect

1546
04:25:27,500 --> 04:25:33,729
nice okay one two three four

1547
04:25:33,729 --> 04:25:46,530
three excellent two two three two three

1548
04:25:46,530 --> 04:25:55,379
i told you it was a pipe oh my god a cheeto

1549
04:25:55,379 --> 04:26:07,020
okay remember this is 15 by 15 10 doesn't do anything for us anymore

1550
04:26:07,020 --> 04:26:18,620
so we can do 12 13 so it's like this because that's one

1551
04:26:18,620 --> 04:26:22,860
two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

1552
04:26:22,860 --> 04:26:27,180
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

1553
04:26:27,180 --> 04:26:32,940
wait a second no that's fine because that's 12 13 14 15 i

1554
04:26:32,940 --> 04:26:44,659
guess it could be either way because it does he buffoon yeah still

1555
04:26:44,659 --> 04:26:47,059
not a real board yeah they're giving us

1556
04:26:47,059 --> 04:26:51,870
they're giving us like the slow drip here therefore 10 would be

1557
04:26:51,870 --> 04:26:55,870
how many how many down is this one two three four five six seven eight

1558
04:26:55,870 --> 04:27:00,430
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen okay so the middle

1559
04:27:00,430 --> 04:27:05,020
ten here so that would be like in here

1560
04:27:05,020 --> 04:27:08,620
let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

1561
04:27:08,620 --> 04:27:15,940
one two three same deal here eight nine

1562
04:27:15,940 --> 04:27:23,969
ten can't really do much with that but we do know this is eight

1563
04:27:23,969 --> 04:27:27,250
and this why is it why wouldn't they fill this one in they filled all the

1564
04:27:27,250 --> 04:27:31,809
other ones in why not this one well that just made everything way

1565
04:27:31,809 --> 04:27:37,069
easier because now i can go one two three four five six seven eight

1566
04:27:37,069 --> 04:27:49,790
one two three four five six seven eight so that's can't be that can't be over

1567
04:27:49,790 --> 04:27:53,059
here actually none of these can be over here

1568
04:27:53,059 --> 04:28:00,030
wait yeah yeah this yeah yeah one could still be here

1569
04:28:00,030 --> 04:28:09,680
that one could be right here it probably is let's see

1570
04:28:09,680 --> 04:28:21,120
six one two three four five six two three four five six and that's

1571
04:28:21,120 --> 04:28:23,360
reaching i don't know if that's true or not

1572
04:28:23,440 --> 04:28:29,940
it's reaching two three four five six seven eight

1573
04:28:29,940 --> 04:28:39,149
two three four five six seven eight all right there's the ten there's the

1574
04:28:39,149 --> 04:28:42,750
ten close that looks pretty good now we

1575
04:28:42,750 --> 04:28:48,030
got twelve one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

1576
04:28:48,030 --> 04:28:58,110
still don't know do something funny no i'm gonna do something funny let me

1577
04:28:58,110 --> 04:29:01,709
talk about one two three four one two three four

1578
04:29:01,790 --> 04:29:11,040
these two that's the two there here's the three

1579
04:29:11,040 --> 04:29:18,819
there's your six make do funny funny something funny

1580
04:29:18,819 --> 04:29:23,229
now it's not all about fun and games it's not all about funny

1581
04:29:23,229 --> 04:29:44,430
sometimes it's about just relaxing eight five six eight so there you go

1582
04:29:44,430 --> 04:29:50,399
i want a joke i want a joke there are no jokes

1583
04:29:50,399 --> 04:30:12,719
let me see what we got here four the ones are gonna be tricky

1584
04:30:13,040 --> 04:30:20,899
brown note sapped him of all is funny i thought sapped well i'm just having a

good time that's all that i had that you know

1586
04:30:27,260 --> 04:30:31,180
well it's very clear that one two three four

1587
04:30:31,180 --> 04:30:37,979
one two three four so this is nothing one two three four one two three four

1588
04:30:37,979 --> 04:30:41,579
so these are this middle here so it has to be one two three four five

1589
04:30:41,579 --> 04:30:56,979
four five excellent excellent i jumped into my favorite streamer stream after

1590
04:30:56,979 --> 04:30:59,860
a long day at work extremely tired to see him playing a boomer game

1591
04:30:59,860 --> 04:31:04,579
also why wasn't saturn on the t-shirt care to explain

1592
04:31:04,579 --> 04:31:21,489
because they're standing on saturn but how do i need to explain that

1593
04:31:21,489 --> 04:31:26,639
by the way if you don't know i have merchandise t-shirts

30 days old just about the night sky t-shirt and glue man had made a

1595
04:31:30,399 --> 04:31:35,420
return if you do hashtag shirts you're gonna

1596
04:31:35,420 --> 04:31:40,739
find the store and maybe you'll buy one if you want

1597
04:31:40,739 --> 04:31:45,219
there's no reason to unless you want the shirt and want to be involved in the

1598
04:31:45,219 --> 04:31:48,750
cool shirt club all right hold on what is this

1599

close enough one two three four five six seven eight

1607
04:32:55,680 --> 04:33:05,840

curious how this plays out we got we got a lot of we got a lot of

1729
04:52:05,919 --> 04:52:12,900
people in complete anarchy we got we need some people to come in here

1730
04:52:12,900 --> 04:52:16,619
and really take control and work as a team and get this done

1731
04:52:16,619 --> 04:52:22,669
and to drown out all the people that are just

1732
04:52:22,669 --> 04:52:37,840
trying to make it hell read bits while chat kills your channel

1733
04:52:37,840 --> 04:52:41,540
i'm not i'm not leaving yet i'm not turning i'm not

1734
04:52:41,540 --> 04:53:06,020
leaving stream's on over oh oh oh play sad music well i heard an

1735
04:53:06,020 --> 04:53:41,500
entire row wildly enough look at that we got three in the

1736
04:53:41,500 --> 04:53:45,229
middle i don't think that's the right place

1737
04:53:45,229 --> 04:54:15,549
might be add a timer to the screen there yeah there is a timer isn't it

1738
04:54:15,549 --> 04:54:28,159
already on we actually can't the row and column

1739
04:54:28,159 --> 04:54:43,900
fills are too strong do a long slow mode check the

1740
04:54:43,900 --> 04:54:59,580
settings come on pause show time there you go

1741
04:54:59,580 --> 04:55:19,169
13 and a half minutes almost 14 minutes 14 minutes and then no progress

1742
04:55:19,169 --> 04:55:21,970
i think i actually probably put it on a slow mode a certain

1743
04:55:21,970 --> 04:55:33,700
right turn off the rows and columns i don't think i can do that

1744
04:55:33,700 --> 04:55:39,500
see i can't fill a1 fill i can't turn them off

1745
04:55:39,500 --> 04:56:02,130
click them no it doesn't do anything turn off twitch integration i think i

1746
04:56:02,130 --> 04:56:10,180
think you guys can do it play brain power what is brain power

1960
05:34:18,909 --> 05:34:24,909

1964
05:34:41,869 --> 05:34:44,669
close to being over i just wanted to relax a little bit today

1965
05:34:44,669 --> 05:34:53,810
actually that that actually does help me no it doesn't

1966
05:34:53,810 --> 05:35:01,250
shit one two three four five six one two three four five six okay

1967
05:35:01,250 --> 05:35:06,430
does that do anything for me at all not really

1968
05:35:06,430 --> 05:35:14,340
we've been relaxing all day yeah we're just

1969
05:35:14,340 --> 05:35:23,279
chilling what is hanging out three one two three i just don't know

1970
05:35:23,279 --> 05:35:25,840
this is my first time in your stream and i stayed the whole stream well

1971
05:35:25,840 --> 05:35:32,909
welcome andrew thanks for staying we fuck around a lot here but it's all

1972
05:35:32,909 --> 05:35:41,119
in good fun welcome i don't know any of this

1973
05:35:41,119 --> 05:35:48,849
although two and in space let's just say it starts here one two three four five

1974
05:35:48,849 --> 05:35:52,830
six seven one two three one two i guess it

1975
05:35:52,830 --> 05:35:54,830
could it's got to be some of these in the middle here the five in the

1976
05:35:54,830 --> 05:35:57,419
middle that's a guess but it's i think it's

1977
05:35:57,419 --> 05:36:04,669
worth a shot what a shitty first stream to watch

1978
05:36:04,669 --> 05:36:09,340
what's wrong with this i like this stream i thought this is fun

1979
05:36:09,340 --> 05:36:20,639
that's that is five four is probably four

1980
05:36:20,639 --> 05:36:44,349
then that's six okay that's either that's probably two

1981
05:36:44,349 --> 05:36:49,069
two one two three i think that works i think that's good but what about the

1982
05:36:49,069 --> 05:36:54,849
middle here one five three two is this five or is this the space

1983
05:36:54,849 --> 05:36:58,610
in between where the three is one two three one two

1984
05:36:58,610 --> 05:37:02,130
because then that would be one two three four

1985
05:37:02,130 --> 05:37:09,200
five i'm liking it i'm liking it so far i'm liking it

1986
05:37:09,200 --> 05:37:18,459
two two again that was a perfect co-op really was

1987
05:37:18,459 --> 05:37:31,700
got that one all right two three four five

1988
05:37:31,700 --> 05:37:47,919
oh fuck shit this doesn't work no no no no no no no no it's already

1989
05:37:47,919 --> 05:38:00,000
screwed up one four this works though this is okay i

1990
05:38:00,000 --> 05:38:14,509
think skeleton fruit if you had the cheat

1991
05:38:14,509 --> 05:38:17,470
sheet this wouldn't be hard i'm not gonna use the cheat sheet

1992
05:38:19,259 --> 05:38:27,779
it has to be here if that's not correct then i've got more problems

1993
05:38:27,779 --> 05:38:40,720
that's all seven three okay it is the five in the middle so it's three again

1994
05:38:40,720 --> 05:38:44,610
one two three four five does that work though

1995
05:38:44,610 --> 05:38:49,970
one two three fuck one two three four five does

1996
05:38:49,970 --> 05:39:00,909
that's five one two one three is left you got the two then you got the

1997
05:39:00,909 --> 05:39:05,069
three i think it's currently working out

1998
05:39:05,069 --> 05:39:14,659
this three two three this looks really messed up but i think i got it

1999
05:39:14,659 --> 05:39:35,700
three three again then that's five no this is good okay it's sands

2000
05:39:35,700 --> 05:39:38,659

2060
05:50:57,500 --> 05:51:04,139
one two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine

2061
05:51:05,919 --> 05:51:24,799
all right close very close one four one two three four one two three four two three four

2062
05:51:28,020 --> 05:51:48,770
uh hold on hold on one one four one there it is which leads to this is done it's right here

2063
05:51:48,770 --> 05:52:01,459

2065
05:52:21,259 --> 05:52:30,080
last one this is that last one last one last one last one this final one it is a minecraft

2066
05:52:30,080 --> 05:52:38,669
sprite this is it final puzzle of the night it was fun this is a really relaxing interesting

2067
05:52:38,669 --> 05:52:42,270
game p cross i hope you learned it hope you figured out how to do it and hope you play it

2068
05:52:42,270 --> 05:52:46,029
because it's very fun interesting and really uh moves your brain all right here we go final

2069
05:52:46,029 --> 05:53:10,540
puzzle as you nine so then that gives us two okay not very much to go on one two three four

2070
05:53:10,540 --> 05:53:20,909
five six seven yep seven seven fourteen fifteen there you go this is nine a ten of course

2071
05:53:21,790 --> 05:53:37,360
so let's see from here one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five

2072
05:53:37,360 --> 05:53:47,150
six seven eight nineteen now this is this works because it already started up here

2073
05:53:47,150 --> 05:54:03,939
that's fine three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine

2074
05:54:04,740 --> 05:54:13,549
it's two two two two they're all twos one two three four five six

2075
05:54:14,430 --> 05:54:25,740
and eight which brings us to this two of all this three in the middle here one two three

2076
05:54:26,860 --> 05:54:39,330
one one no eight and one maybe let's see one two three four this could be the one

2077
05:54:39,970 --> 05:54:45,090
let's see if this is the one one two three four five six seven eight yeah it could be the one

2078
05:54:46,779 --> 05:54:57,380
just don't know there's still enough room for it to be the one 12 is right here though so one

2079
05:54:57,380 --> 05:55:03,619
two three like this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two

2080
05:55:05,860 --> 05:55:18,659
what does that do for us that's one they're all ones okay and we'll big numbers

2081
05:55:19,380 --> 05:55:36,099
i don't see any this does narrow this down though one two three two two one two two so

2082
05:55:36,099 --> 05:55:46,720
this could be here oh it has to be because of those two cool and this also is two two

2083
05:55:47,439 --> 05:55:57,979
so now i know and this has to be two oh yes oh yes thank goodness

2084
05:55:58,779 --> 05:56:07,500
is three oh this is great go go go go this is perfect ready one two three one two three

2085
05:56:07,500 --> 05:56:14,750

2373
06:44:18,720 --> 06:44:27,659
earlier the stream fiti gave five tier three community subs that's a lot of money tier three

2374

2379
06:45:15,819 --> 06:45:29,630

2380
06:45:29,709 --> 06:45:35,970
fiti thanks for the 15 dollars on top of your five tier three subs sorry can you explain the

2381
06:45:35,970 --> 06:45:40,290
game again that was a little quick for me hopefully six hours later you figured it out

2382
06:45:40,290 --> 06:45:44,369
it's pretty easy but kind of difficult you kind of just need to know what's going on

2383
06:45:47,810 --> 06:45:52,290
war void thanks for the five dollars war void i enjoyed that thanos with a stroke impression

2384
06:45:52,849 --> 06:46:02,639
that was so long ago i forgot i forgot even doing that derma lied about minecraft vr and

2385
06:46:02,639 --> 06:46:07,150
somebody's username i'm doing minecraft vr i told you that was still happening

2386
06:46:09,439 --> 06:46:15,979
i'm still doing that your username is is completely irrelevant i'm going to play

2387
06:46:15,979 --> 06:46:28,189
minecraft in vr i never said i wasn't doing that topac thanks for the three bucks topac

2388
06:46:29,009 --> 06:46:33,169
not sure if you spoke about this already but any word on why save was removed is unfortunate

2389
06:46:33,169 --> 06:46:39,069
to kill the off-stream chat uh i kind of wanted to clean up the off-stream chat a little

2390
06:46:39,069 --> 06:46:43,869
bit i think a lot of people were kind of just putting commands in and there's some i think

2391
06:46:43,869 --> 06:46:48,909
there was a couple people that had like scripts or something to like just run in the offline

2392
06:46:48,909 --> 06:46:56,029
chat i'd rather just people be able to talk and it was an old kind of meme old joke from

2393
06:46:56,029 --> 06:47:04,020
more than almost a year or two ago he saved them all there they were like there was you

2394
06:47:04,020 --> 06:47:13,169
saved 73 000 seagulls you saved every seagull on earth why not let it reach 100 000

2395
06:47:13,169 --> 06:47:29,150
because there's not 100 000 seagulls on earth there's only 73 428 you got them all the zoo

2396
06:47:29,150 --> 06:47:39,330
is packed yeah there was too many seagulls in that zoo but i cleaned up some commands

2397
06:47:40,689 --> 06:47:47,200
there's you know i'm just doing just doing a cleanup of kind of nightbot commands random

2398
06:47:47,200 --> 06:48:03,020
bot commands but that's pretty much the reason why talk about the game oh yeah i did act

2399
06:48:03,819 --> 06:48:09,279
not that's not necessarily to counteract the fact that i got rid of that but i turned on that

2400
06:48:09,279 --> 06:48:15,330
streamer legends game it's that like idling rpg game where you get loot and you fight together

2401
06:48:16,209 --> 06:48:19,490
i figured maybe something with like offline chat or before a stream starts might be

2402
06:48:19,490 --> 06:48:22,930
worth just playing around and being able to talk about and hang out i know some other

2403
06:48:22,930 --> 06:48:31,200
streamers have it on figured it would just something to just have you can pop it out

2404
06:48:31,200 --> 06:48:36,560
you can play it there's oh what the fuck i'm what i gotta give the loot i gotta give i'm

2405
06:48:36,560 --> 06:48:40,880
only gonna do this once i'm not i'm gonna okay by the way i still had jules stream up

2406
06:48:42,080 --> 06:48:48,909
uh i could give people loot right now hold on if you have it open right now uh i'm gonna give

2407
06:48:48,909 --> 06:48:56,580

2408
06:48:56,580 --> 06:49:11,389
every day all right you ready here it comes send gifts bingo well it's just something fun

2409
06:49:11,389 --> 06:49:18,220
to have this doesn't cost any money or anything it's just there if you want to play

2410
06:49:18,220 --> 06:49:27,090
with it you get gold for killing monsters and you can contribute together as a community

2411
06:49:28,130 --> 06:49:35,040
to upgrade the barracks and upgrade the base it's just like a little dinky rpg game

2412
06:49:35,599 --> 06:49:47,419
but it's just gonna be there what's it called they're called stream legends stream legends

2414
06:49:53,419 --> 06:49:57,340

2415
06:49:58,060 --> 06:50:04,639
can you move it further up so we can watch the stream here's the thing you can pop that window

2470
06:58:30,400 --> 06:58:34,479
i actually went on vacation in las vegas for the first time last week and it was really fun

2471
06:58:34,479 --> 06:58:39,279
however the one thing i hated was how every fifth pedestrian in the city spat out a cloud

2472
06:58:39,279 --> 06:58:44,479
of either cigar smoke or weed on my face and i got a little obnoxious very fun trip regardless

2473
06:58:44,479 --> 06:58:54,430
seems like a nice place to live too uh it is yeah i mean i think i mean those also might be

2474
06:58:54,430 --> 06:59:04,529
like vape pens you know those are fucking everywhere uh let me tell you about a stream

2475
06:59:04,529 --> 06:59:08,770
that i'm not going to do that i thought was potentially funny spoiler alert for like a

2476
06:59:08,770 --> 06:59:13,409
future stream that's not going to happen because i like axed it i was going to play fortnight

2477
06:59:13,409 --> 06:59:22,459
in a tank top and just have loud blasting music have kind of like a odd weird shitty

2478
06:59:22,459 --> 06:59:26,939
camera setup just ripping a fucking vape pen just like

2479
06:59:29,099 --> 06:59:33,040
and eventually what you don't see i don't really talk that much what you don't see

2480
06:59:33,040 --> 06:59:38,479
is over the course of about an hour or two i have like four fog machines that are slowly

2481
06:59:38,479 --> 06:59:49,180
going to be used and turned on until the whole room is filled with fog and there is

2482
06:59:49,180 --> 06:59:59,069
no joke that's that's the whole joke like i just i just turn my head like this i go like

2483
06:59:59,069 --> 07:00:10,270
this shit like this is a fucking shoot this thick fucking cloud over here right all the

2484
07:00:10,270 --> 07:00:14,430
while like smoke is just filling this room tons of it to a point you can't even fucking see

2485
07:00:14,430 --> 07:00:19,790
my face it takes like two hours for it to happen you know like all right wait wait

2486
07:00:19,790 --> 07:00:36,430
where we dropping for like fucking two straight hours and eventually the smoke alarm was going

2487
07:00:36,430 --> 07:00:46,479
to go off like and i was going to keep playing for like another 30 minutes and then

2488
07:00:46,479 --> 07:01:04,450
eventually the stream was just going to turn off without me saying bye now i'm sad that it

2489
07:01:04,450 --> 07:01:09,220
didn't happen well i was going to do it in the studio i wasn't going to do it like here

2615
07:21:35,889 --> 07:21:42,349

07:21:42,349 --> 07:21:52,770
game five years late come on that might be that call me rude but seriously who wanted artifact

2617
07:21:52,770 --> 07:22:00,259
nobody wanted that game take any franchise that valve has any of them i don't care which one

2618
07:22:00,259 --> 07:22:12,740
ricochet 2 would be more well received you got so many great franchises i mean what is

2624
07:23:05,759 --> 07:23:16,099
