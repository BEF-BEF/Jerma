00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:12,500
Hello, good afternoon or good morning, those of you on the west coast, like me. How are you?

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:25,239
We are back again. Fun filled day of streaming on twitch.tv. People are calling me a liar already.

3
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:33,270
I haven't even spoken. I haven't even talked yet. Can you read my mind? Can you read my lie mind?

4
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:44,100
I'm a lied about house flipper. We're playing desperados three today. Don't exactly know where

5
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:58,840
you're getting that from. I'm checking on you. Take off the diaper. Hold on. What? Look,

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,969
click link, click link. I don't want to. What is this? I don't want to click this.

7
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:18,819
What is this? I don't think so. When does that? When does a house flippers DLC come up?

8
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:27,909
No, I didn't. They're doing like an HGTV thing, right? Is that out? I gotta fucking play this.

9
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,230
All right. All right. All right. Right. How about this? I'll give you a date on Wednesday,

10
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:41,019
the 19th of August. I will play house flippers, HGTV, fucking DLC. Okay. It doesn't matter what

11
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:47,159
the fuck I'm doing on Wednesday. Whatever it is, it's off the table. That's in like a few weeks.

12
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:55,769
Okay. Well, whatever. I was going to, I really wanted to play desperados three today.

13
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:04,950
That's it's off the table now. Right. It's today, the 19th. Today's the night. All right.

14
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,430
You promised you promised. All right. All right. I don't, whatever. If I'm going to be held to my

15
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:18,699
word, which I hope I am, I'm going to play house flippers, HGTV, DLC. I got to be held to my word.

16
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:27,060
All right. Well, I had this whole cowboy costume over here that I was going to put on today.

17
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:40,759
Are you sure? I do. Okay. Looks like I'm just going to return it while you play house flippers.

18
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:49,900
That would just be odd. Why would I be dressed up as a cowboy? I guess I'm that's I just maybe

19
00:02:49,900 --> 00:03:08,889
I'm just a cowboy. Who cares? Turn your cam on. Turn your cam on. I why make a cowboy house?

20
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:19,780
No, that's too easy. That's too easy. Put on comedy. Hold on. I got to, I got to change the

21
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:28,469
title. God, you know, I got to be held to my promises about it's HGTV, right? TV ready homes.

22
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:45,909
Is that good? TV ready homes, house flipper. Good thing I own this shit already. Good thing. I

23
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:54,169
already own this DLC about the whole thing. I bought everything. Yeah. And don't let, let,

24
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:59,289
I want you to show people this when they say this dude doesn't do what he says. He does. He

25
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:04,009
does not go back on his word. If he says he's going to play a game, he's going to play it.

26
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:09,300
Like he, if he says he's going to play a game tomorrow, he's going to do it.

27
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,779
Just get this open. Hold on. All right. Let's, let's go. We're going to play house flippers.

28
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:27,050
DLC play saw then I never promised anything with saw. So I had no promises. Hey, look,

29
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:35,500
there it is. House flipper. You guys remember this game? Oh, well, let's take a look around our,

30
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,259
a double. He's a double liar, but he can do resident evil four. That's probably never going

31
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:50,620
to happen unless it's on the Wii. The PC one I thought was going to make me sick, but hey,

32
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,790
take a look at this, right? Oh, let's get it. Uh, those last time we played house flipper, HGTV.

33
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,189
Well, this is the house. This is garden flipper. Actually. Last time we played this, I made this

34
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:14,620
sick garden. Remember this is the old house. I don't know why I just, I thought just said

35
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:23,240
or wallet out like dump money in here. This is pretty sick. Oh yeah. Right. It's the family guy

36
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:35,879
house. This is supposed to be the Griffin house. I forgot. This is an expensive ass house. What

37
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,500
else? What else is back here? Oh yeah. The AOL. Oh, right. The projector, right? We're going to,

38
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,540
it's going to be movie night. You can come park and watch TV, make pizzas. I forgot about this

39
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:55,180
game. I love this game. All right, let's go. There's a kiddie pool, another pond with some seagulls,

40
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:08,759
picnic table. What else is back here? The grill, right? Nice. That's a pretty good gamer. That's a

41
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:22,540
gamer fridge. That's a huge gamer fridge. Stove. Here are the seats. And don't, aren't these

42
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,220
actually connected to plumbing too, by the way? Those even give you, you think this is just a

43
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:34,279
funny joke for the stream. So there's actual plumbing down here. I remember that. Big bean bag

44
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:42,730
chair. It's a cool color scheme. I forgot about this. I gotta, let me look around. Oh yeah. There's

45
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:53,269
two toilets. I gotta remember this. This is my, this is my design philosophy. Eat while you shit,

46
00:06:53,269 --> 00:07:00,540
technically. Why are there three sinks? Because it's like a public restroom. What the hell is

47
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:09,129
going on up here? Oh, that's right. The pool was too expensive. So I made just one of those

48
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:22,019
swim forward while the current tries to take you machines. Oh, this is where it happened, right?

49
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:28,279
This is where it was. I feel like if it's an old historic house, like an old streamer house,

50
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:35,540
this is where he did the worst impression of 2018. Yeah. I remember it. It was right here. Wow.

51
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:53,500
This is super historic. All right. Let's keep going. Let's go do the new, uh, DLC. Where is it?

52
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:04,459
Okay. Map of jobs. This is not realistic. That number is not 580. Boy, they give you like a

53
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:19,850
Sims map now. HGTV. Is this like a, this is, but they're not like, are there police over here?

54
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:35,289
Why is there police everywhere? Okay. Is this the one? Job, a new beginning. Welcome to your

55
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:39,850
first job in Sunset Bay. Are you ready to help John and Nicole renovate the house of their dreams?

56
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,570
While the house is small, the view is amazing. You'll have to make some decisions when it comes

57
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:50,940
to room arrangement. The shack under the house is especially problematic. Good luck. There's four

58
00:08:50,940 --> 00:09:04,230
people buried there. Only got 6,500 bucks. Go to the Simpsons house. Omega-Lel, his fucking brain.

59
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:16,419
Omega-Lel, Omega-Lel. What the fuck? But I'm going to record myself be saying I'm going to

60
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:20,419
play house with my 19th. And then you guys can click link to it. I'll be like, fuck, right. Well,

61
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:27,669
sorry guys. You know, okay. Here's the thing. Really? Like they teach like this type of photo

62
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:36,230
manipulation in the fourth grade now. Really guys? You honestly, this is like, you can do this in 15

63
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,190
seconds. In fact, it took you a while to do that. Actually it's been 10 minutes and we get this now.

64
00:09:41,190 --> 00:10:03,879
Okay. So yeah, so fake. Omega-Lel doctored. He's not wrong, chat. Are these people on HGTV?

65
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:17,289
Is this a show? Are these people on a show on HGTV? Or did HGTV just hand their logo to the

66
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:23,990
house flipper guys and just said, yeah, just put it on there. What does this have to do with HGTV?

67
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:29,240
Okay. Welcome to your first job. Are you ready to help John and Nicole renovate the house of

68
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,970
their dreams? Oh yeah. Okay. I got 6,500 bucks. I got 6,500 dollars. This is what I have to work

69
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,360
with. When you work on jobs in Sunset Bay, there is a specific budget defined for each one. It's

70
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,919
the amount of money that the family is willing to spend on their dream house. Remember to stay

71
00:10:46,919 --> 00:11:00,570
within the budget while renovating. Oh, their dream house. What a dream house. Wait, did you guys

72
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,840
start the renovation and then just dad just kind of started living out here? What the fuck is this?

73
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:17,059
6,500 bucks. All right. What this looks like is this looks like like dad built this part of the

74
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:23,779
house himself and we have like a Hansel and Gretel trail of how he started to get really exhausted

75
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:30,379
and fucked the whole thing up. It led into here and then he got like shitfaced and threw the

76
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:38,039
remaining wood into the shed. I can't do this. I'm already like 80 grand in the hole. Get the HGTV

77
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:46,500
guys to come. Just have them come fix it. Just look, I promise I'll cry when you reveal the house

78
00:11:46,500 --> 00:12:09,299
if you come and do it, please. I promise I'll do a massive Pog face when you reveal. I'll freak out.

79
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:17,190
I'll sprint in a circle and scream. I'll take my shirt off and just sprint around yelling. I'll

80
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:35,210
take both my hands and grab the Camberman's lens, pull it in and go. Yeah, 6,500 bucks. This doesn't

81
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:46,220
cost any money, right? Keep your shirt on TOS. This is not me doing this. Okay, so I have to

82
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:54,100
what do they want? Look at the tablet for a second. All right, first floor. Remove the trash.

83
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:04,409
Make a decision in room 4M squared. Clean dirt. Okay, make a decision. Let's go make a decision.

84
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:16,220
What room does it want me to do? Okay, there's a lot of bugs in this house. What decision do they

85
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:23,320
want? Okay, make a decision. Definitely a TV. The room feels so empty without it. We can also add

86
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,059
some decorations, a carpet, and a few potted plants. A fireplace could make this room feel

87
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:34,019
more complete. A large corner electric fireplace. No, no, no, no. I don't care. I'm not doing an

88
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:40,860
electric fireplace. No way. I don't even care what the other one is. I'm sorry, guys. Something about

89
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,500
flicking a switch and fire starts in my house. I don't want that. That's dangerous to me. You

90
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:55,529
don't flick a switch and your oven goes to 500 degrees. Nope. I wouldn't want that either. All

91
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:05,220
right, let's clean. Easy. Yes, you would. I would not want that. That's terrifying. Who wants an

92
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:15,000
oven that if you hit the on button is instantly 500 degrees? That's terrifying. All right, hold

93
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,889
on. A living room. Chandelier with bulbs. Let's get rid of this fucking thing. What do you want

94
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:35,960
to do with it? Remove object. Oh, okay. Wardrobe Drenemo. Is this a wardrobe Drenemo? Which one?

95
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:53,830
This one? Let's clean this place up first. What? Why is everybody flicking things? What is all this?

96
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,250
Okay, hold on. I need to go over this because this is fucking me up. This is freaking me out.

97
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:14,179
I need to go over this. Address it. Address it. Address it. Address it. Just hold on. I'm

98
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:26,120
going to address it. That's not it. Yeah, I did it. Yeah, whatever. That's me addressing it. All

99
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,700
right. Well, let me see. I don't even know what this is. What the fuck is this? Shit. What do I

100
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:38,149
even save it as? All right. Address it. Address it. Address it. Address it. I'm addressing it.

101
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:48,740
Easy Bake Hard Mode. Why are you watching that? Okay, here we go. Let me shrink this a little bit.

102
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:59,639
Dremeloogs. A fake website. What is that website? I don't want that website. I don't want my logs.

103
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:05,690
I don't know what to delete. That's a good one. What if you just tell the truth? Yeah, I mean,

104
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:11,799
that's true. Play disk skipping noises. Say I dropped it down the stairs. Floppy disk sounds.

105
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:17,480
Ha ha ha. That's so stupid. Yeah, say you heard it. I showed it off on Periscope.

106
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:25,399
Ah, no shit. Okay, hold on. This is like next level faking people's with it saying,

107
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,230
I'm going to record myself and play house flipper. Yeah. Inspect element. Yeah. And then you guys can

108
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,190
link to it. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. I'll get a good one. Okay. I'm rendering the clip. I need

109
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:40,779
to Twitch clip of this. I mean, you guys are really, you guys are really trying at this point,

110
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:48,120
but the fake website, the fake fucking text, the fake everything, fake text, inspect element. Yeah,

111
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:56,570
it was fake. I don't even need to inspect element. I got fucking online x-ray vision.

112
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:04,140
Just wait till they make that shit. Just wait till you're going to have to have online x-ray

113
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,740
vision. It's a button like an extension you're going to have to play to see like if the website's

114
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:20,630
even fucking real. We're getting real fucked up in 10 years. It's a nice bathtub. Link spam. Funny

115
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:29,220
link. Nah, whatever. All right. Let me, I got a living room. I have $300,000. Why do I need $6,500?

116
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,029
Okay. Where's this wardrobe? Is this a wardrobe? What is this? This is a wardrobe, right? Well,

117
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:41,740
it's ugly. Get rid of it. Right. Wardrobe. All right. There we go. Clean the windows. Oh,

118
00:17:41,740 --> 00:18:00,569
this is my favorite part of this game. I fucking love this. Oh, it just does it for me. Oh yeah.

119
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:15,339
Thermal. That was real. It's a hundred percent real. You're a liar. Ask me if I'm a liar again.

120
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:31,339
Say, did you say, did you lie about the clip? What's the question? Did I lie about the clip?

121
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:36,779
Well, the thing is we have to take care of everybody. We have to make sure that we get

122
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:43,980
down with our hands dirty and we get everybody on the right page. I also think that we can make

123
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:58,980
it happen as long as you stick with me. There you go. Here's your answer. Senator Albertson,

124
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:07,559
have you ever eaten glass for fun? Here's the thing. My favorite dog that I've ever had

125
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:15,369
was little Fido. And I'll tell you, he was a good dog. I'm a good dog. And if I can be your senator

126
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:26,230
again, I would be such a good boy. Senator Albertson, is there a, is there a full shit

127
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:34,119
in your underwear right fucking now, right now? Yes or no. You know, the tricky thing about trying

128
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:45,140
to fix this country is just my goodness. We got to get everybody back to work. I will yield the rest

129
00:19:45,140 --> 00:20:07,190
of my time. He has my vote. You can't yield time in an interview. Yes, you can. It's called,

130
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,900
I'm just going to stop talking and stare at the camera until they ask another question. Turn that

131
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:28,259
off. I hate ovens. You get interviewed and you say I'm doing the fifth amendment. Mr. Albertson,

132
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:33,140
I just want to ask about the potential controversy where you chugged an entire Gatorade as fast as

133
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,500
you could on camera for a bunch of people. And you thought it was like funny. And then you like

134
00:20:36,500 --> 00:21:03,299
burped really loud. Mr. Albertson, what can you tell me about school? Well, think about school.

135
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,339
We got to really get in there and I'm going to change everything about, we got to get, we got

136
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:16,460
to reform our schools. We got to make sure everyone's prepared. Absolutely. Mr. Albertson,

137
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:35,609
there's a video of you punching a guy in the face at a bar in downtown Boston. You did that

138
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:50,500
fucking all day. I just like fucking, I should like, all right, I got to play the game of like

139
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:57,529
getting to the sidetrack. All right. Adam Chandler, TV corner cabinet. What's a TV corner cabinet?

140
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:01,859
All right. Well, where's, where's the couch? This is way too far away. You can't see shit from here.

141
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:09,130
You want the TV over here? Uh, wait, next to the people are going to be like walking in the way

142
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:18,470
and shit. Why would you ever want that? You want an Adam Chandler. Okay. Well, let's put the TV in

143
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,440
the shitty place they want it. Clean this. Wait, there's one more window I didn't clean. I forgot

144
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:39,910
one window. I forgot. Where is it? It's got ADHD. Yeah. Oh shit. Fuck. I actually answered the

145
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,980
question. No, I was supposed to tell you how we were going to fix our schools. Shit. Oh well.

146
00:22:46,619 --> 00:23:03,900
Place object. All right. What do we got? TV. Buy. Buy many. $700. How big is this thing?

147
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:21,289
This is 700 bucks. Okay. Well, we'll figure it out later. What a terrible setup. Now I know this

148
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:28,339
setup. I know this exact setup. This is, I just moved into a new place and two months later,

149
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,660
still kind of don't give a shit about this. And it's a pain in the ass, but I'm still, I'm going

150
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:38,039
to do it. I don't even care. Yeah. Eventually I'll get something to put that on, but like,

151
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:48,460
I don't care. I will maybe. Thanks for being with us. That's a pretty cool like streamer end card.

152
00:23:48,460 --> 00:24:02,250
Okay. So now I need a TV corner cabinet. Is that what this is? Okay. What color? All right. How

153
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:17,990
about just bright red? Wait, that would be infuriating. Okay. Imagine buying this and

154
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,880
this is the place that you really thought it was going to be. And your heart was set on this.

155
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:30,380
And now you go, no, I didn't measure it right. Fuck I have, but it has to stay. I'll have to

156
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,779
deal with it. I'll deal with it. I'll just deal with it. You hate it every day, but you know what?

157
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:40,059
You're going to buy a new one, return it, have them, the guys that brought this thing in,

158
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:46,099
you're going to have them bring it out. No, you have to deal with it. God moving sucks.

159
00:24:46,099 --> 00:25:03,740
So does this, by the way, this sucks. What is it? Who's who can watch this? You have to be sitting

160
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,500
here. Wait, no, I get it. Okay. So wait, nevermind. I thought this is a bathroom. I was going to say

161
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:19,160
that makes sense. It's fine. This isn't, this is not fine. Why would you sit at a viewing angle

162
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,349
permanently at like 30, 40 degrees? This is not fine. You have to sit here and like watch the TV.

163
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:53,559
No, you need to be facing forward, facing Adam chandelier. Okay. You want two of these. This is

164
00:25:53,559 --> 00:26:05,349
like, uh, you can't even, I can't even, whatever. All right. What do you want this? A rectangular

165
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:18,740
carpet. Let's do gray. Gray goes with everything. I don't, I don't like how this is set up. How are

166
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:28,150
you supposed to sit here and eat dinner? You can't like sit there and eat dinner on this. How do you

167
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:36,230
only work in gray scale? You design, it's a, this is a living room. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

168
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:43,460
I'm sorry. I am going to tell you guys the age of sitting at the dining table is over. Us,

169
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:50,099
the younger generation, that shit's over. The new dinner table is the coffee table in front of the

170
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:57,940
TV. They're a dinner table for what? To throw all your mail, to like stack a bunch of shit.

171
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,500
And then you get pissed off in six months when there's shit all over the table. Dining room table

172
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:11,299
is just totally like 2010 and before. This is the new dinner table. Everybody gets out, sits in on

173
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:15,299
the table, on the couch. Everyone's just eating off the, everyone's like, yeah, put it on, put

174
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:20,809
SpongeBob on. It's like, oh, I love it. I watch you. Do you know what I watch? I watch, am I weird?

175
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:29,289
Let me ask you this. So this is a YouTube channel. It's called The Wolf Pit and the guy reviews like

176
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:39,299
frozen, like $1 dinners and TV dinners and stuff. And I watch this guy when I eat food. He's like

177
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:43,380
going over how like disgusting it is and like, oh, this is like a $1 TV dinner I got from like

178
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,730
the dollar store or something. And I'm just eating food going, oh, cool. Am I weird? Does that make

179
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:59,220
me a weird person? Yes. It doesn't matter what I'm eating. I could be eating like McDonald's or I

180
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,740
could be eating like a steak. It doesn't, it doesn't matter what it is. I'm going to watch this channel.

181
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:10,009
All right. We know two of those. Where'd you, why would you want, oh, underneath the table.

182
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:24,980
That's never going to get used. And then a Zamiya plant. Okay. I want, why many? Dude. All right.

183
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,579
Can I tell you something about big plants? I'm really telling you something about stuff today,

184
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:38,279
huh? Let me tell you something about X. I think these just get in the way. They look cool, I guess,

185
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:45,099
but I feel like they just get in the way. Where am I? What do I put this? What's this? What? This

186
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:50,150
is just clearly just in the way. You're going to, something's going to be on this table and you're

187
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,680
going to bump into this once and it's going to infuriate you. What do you do with this?

188
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:09,109
It's a Seinfeld joke. Hey, Seinfeld is a legendary show. All right. That doesn't bother me. All right.

189
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:17,059
Living room. We got it. Progress. I have $4,900 left. Okay. Let's keep doing this. Second floor,

190
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:22,230
living room with kitchenette, garden, remove the trash. All right. You want to make a decision in

191
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:27,750
this room down here. Let's go. This is fine. Look, we're trying to make a little bit more,

192
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:39,539
make the bed. I shouldn't have even done that. Who makes beds? My pillows are just on the ground

193
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:45,940
every single night and I just pick them back up and go back and go to bed. Yeah. You're a slob.

194
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:55,609
Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. Wasn't there one down here? Okay. Make a decision. Sauna and a bathroom. Being

195
00:29:55,609 --> 00:30:00,549
able to hop in the sauna. What? You can make a sauna? Just cleaning it up will suffice. This is

196
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:08,940
a very capable storage room. Isn't the sauna expensive? How much is a sauna? Are you sure?

197
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:12,059
Why am I getting, who wants to be a millionaire? This is too, this is too much money.

198
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:31,099
Why would you want a sauna down here? That's actually weird. Isn't that strange? What's this

199
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:43,420
guy do down here? Oh, I got to clean. Hey, an anonymous gifter. Thanks for the five subs and

200
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:51,319
atmosphere starfish. Thanks for the five subs as well. What is he building in here? I don't know,

201
00:30:51,319 --> 00:31:02,710
man. Can I just sell this whole thing? Yeah, I can. What am I doing? Can't sell trash though.

202
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:08,359
You can now finish incomplete jobs. I'm going to finish it. Wait, they ordered a sauna and I get

203
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:13,700
to just leave? Yeah. And I think down here I want it to be red. And I think over here,

204
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,859
the wall should be gray. Put a couple of carpets down. We want a sauna down here. Okay.

205
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:31,049
Let's just leave. And I never come back. I gave up. Guys, I gave up on you when you wanted

206
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:43,930
TV in the corner. That stupid thing. I need a dining table. All right. That's it for the trash.

207
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:55,140
Four dollars and 42 cents. All right. Literally all city contractors. So what do I need a sledgehammer

208
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:06,859
for? I don't even have, why do I not have a sledgehammer? Lay floor tiles. Where's my

209
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:22,549
sledgehammer? 80, 100. Where's my sledgehammer? I sold the sledgehammer. No, that's not how that

210
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:32,180
works though. Sink plumb. Oh, maybe I don't have to do it. Okay. Scenic sauna heater. That's a sauna

211
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:51,940
operate. Sauna. Scenic sauna heater. This is 420 bucks. All right. Where does this go? Lay floor

212
00:32:51,940 --> 00:33:03,240
tiles. Oh, I need floor tiles. Okay. Hold on. What do they want for tiles? Floor tiles. What do you

213
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,420
think would look good in a sauna? That's my opinion on rhinos. They're very dangerous. They're

214
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:17,990
very cool though. They can go very fast. Oh, I like the gray bubble tiles. What do you guys think?

215
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:28,819
Fuck. I do like gray, huh? I can't help it. It just, I like it. It goes with everything.

216
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:52,500
I have a Squidward house. It's fine. Ceramic brown rectangles. Oh no. We've spent the money already.

217
00:33:52,500 --> 00:34:01,930
Wait, can I sell it? Can I sell it? How much do I sell it for? Oh no. I have to go over the tiles

218
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:14,860
with other tiles. Great. What the hell was it called? Floor tiles. Whatever. Where is it brown?

219
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:35,340
What? Ceramic tiles brown. What? Why is this wrong? Floor panel dark? Hold on. What is going on?

220
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,829
Wait, it's different rooms. I thought this whole thing was a sauna. I was going to put a toilet

221
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:48,550
here. Okay. Brown rectangles. I don't even have the right thing. Yes, I do. Okay. Here we go.

222
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:59,210
All right. There we are. Going a little over budget, but it happens. Which room is this one?

223
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:15,690
Is this brown tile inside? Okay. Floor panel dark. Just wait till I can make my own house.

224
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:42,860
Poop line sauna. What was it called? Dark. Floor panel dark. Is this the my summer house sauna?

225
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:48,519
You know, somebody said to play that game. It's been significantly updated or something

226
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:59,059
since the last time I played it. All right. There we go. Now I need the scenic sauna heater.

227
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:18,900
Okay. Which one is the sauna? This is the sauna. Okay. Sauna bench. Sauna bench. Okay. What about

228
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:33,610
the galaxy? What about the galaxy brain sauna heater? Isn't that one better? Wait, I need two

229
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:44,119
of these. Okay. You sit down here. Corner sauna bench. Sauna bucket with ladle. There's not room

230
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:59,510
for this stuff in here. Oh yeah. Right. Cause you go with the on the rocks, right? Right. Sauna bench.

231
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:18,820
No, no, that's not right. Sauna. Sauna. Corner bench. Why do you need this? Are this many people

232
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:25,289
going to sit in here like naked? I don't understand. How many people do you want to come in here?

233
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:36,969
One, two, three, four, five, six, six people in here. This is a one person sauna. Another corner

234
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:56,199
sauna bench. Look, we'll just stadium seated like they do somewhere there. You're going to sit up

235
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:00,280
here and your legs are going to be just dangling down here. And there's a guy going to be sitting

236
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:10,300
right here. This doesn't work. Can I put a sign up that says like must wear clothes? Like, can I

237
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:18,760
probably like must be fully clothed or something? What do you mean? No, you don't have to go into a

238
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,159
sauna nude. You can go in there and like a bathing suit, bathing suit, a bathing suits appreciated

239
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:33,590
with an asterisks and you have to get clothes and it says required. Okay. And then we need a lamp

240
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:55,349
lamp. Okay. And somebody can sit on this. I can't even turn it. Oh no, it's supposed to go up. Okay.

241
00:38:55,349 --> 00:39:11,000
I see. Ooh, wait, that's not even on. Oh, nice. Okay. Jeremy, since you're keeping your word,

242
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,940
should you play eternal darkness? He said, yeah, I missed it. Okay. This one, this is done.

243
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:28,969
Sauna is done. I'm probably doing all my money. 4,300. Shower plumbing system. Wait, you can

244
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:40,699
actually do this now? Oh, I was going to wait. Why is there a shower here? A shower next to the sauna?

245
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:56,250
Okay. I guess so. Of course, dude. Isn't that too much money though? Like you have a shower just

246
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:08,170
upstairs. Use your shower up there. Buy a shower and mount it. Toilet plumbing system. Wait a minute.

247
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:22,969
I don't hold on. So this is just a toilet. Why can't you see through this? There's no door here.

248
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:40,170
Hey guys. Okay. Sink plumbing system. What do you mean sink plumbing? Why do you need all this stuff?

249
00:40:46,409 --> 00:41:00,519
I don't agree with this sauna field. I don't know. What's the point of having this bathroom?

250
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:14,889
I cannot do it now. We'll think out, you know, when houses have four and a half or like five

251
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:22,599
and a half bathrooms for some reason, like what do you pick a day of the week to go shit in each one?

252
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:36,739
I mean, no. You guys never heard of like a three, four, five bathrooms? Yes. How do you

253
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:43,289
have half a bathroom? Do I? I think you're messing around. Okay. Messing around. All right.

254
00:41:43,289 --> 00:42:02,389
Mountable shower idiom. Okay. This is what they want. Wait, isn't there supposed to be a toilet

255
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:15,940
here? This is going to fit over here. Wait, what's this for? There's not going to be any room.

256
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:45,320
That's the sink. Uh, assemble it. Okay. Oh, dude. How do I assemble it? Is there something I'm missing?

257
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:56,889
You, you broke the shower because it's like, cause it's hovering. It's like a foot off the ground.

258
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:19,900
Okay. Wait, but then what the hell is this for? Mountable shower idiom. What? Why is this doing

259
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:45,019
this? Rotate. I can't. Why does it snap back to there? Okay. That didn't do anything. I tried it.

260
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:53,110
I'm losing money. All right. I'm done. I'm going to leave. I gotta go. That was fun to make the

261
00:43:53,110 --> 00:44:07,820
sauna. Cool. Nice. Uh, goodbye. Wait, photographing? Wait, it's doing before and after photos.

262
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:24,199
Oh, wow. Nothing. You didn't change shit. That's not all it is. Okay. I hired a cleaning company.

263
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:38,250
Let's take a look at your new house. A cleaning company came and picked up the wood. You've ruined

264
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:49,699
a room and left. And I made 7,300 bucks doing it. Bathing suits are not allowed in saunas.

265
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:58,860
Okay. Cool. How much money do I have? I have like $300,000. All right. All right. Getting

266
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:10,469
interesting here. We have this one or this one. Check out this one. Man's job. Okay. What about

267
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:18,260
this one? 100 year old memories. This house is over a hundred years old and the ubiquitous wood gives

268
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:24,940
it a unique appeal. It'd be great for Trevor and Lily and their kids. A family of sailors. It's

269
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:31,130
going to be haunted. The family fell in love with the house at first sight. It was not cheap, but

270
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:34,809
the budget for its renovation is limited. It should be just enough to have it refreshed and

271
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:40,659
introduce some necessary changes. I used to hire the wrong guy. Never hire an interior decorator

272
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:59,820
on Craigslist. And you're about to find out why. Make the Simpsons house. No. All right. Clean the

273
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:21,719
dirt. Oh, my favorite part. Weeds? He hates the Simpsons. Yeah. I think I probably do now. Like

274
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:25,480
when was the last time you watched it? I haven't watched it. I don't think, maybe not hate them.

275
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,940
I don't hate the Simpsons, but like I don't, I haven't watched an episode in like probably

276
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:36,789
15 years. I don't, I don't know why. Does he hate it? No, he doesn't watch it. I don't even think

277
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:45,340
I can name you the whole family right now if I tried. Bart, uh, Bart, Lisa, Santa's helper,

278
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:59,619
Homer, Marge, uh, and Margaret. I, I, I stick into it. I got it. This place is a mess. Let's remove

279
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:04,340
the fluorescent lights and the mirror from above the sink. We can lay elegant wall tiles and mount

280
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,900
a new mirror. This mirror fits and looks like a window. Let's keep it. We will just buy a few.

281
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:16,199
Yeah. I like the weird one. I like the weird while you're at the kitchen sink, stared a huge

282
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:30,170
mirror. This place is filthy. What do you mean that's wrong? What do you think Maggie is short

283
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:55,420
for? Yeah. Margaret, Maggie. How do you, do you guys not know? You don't. Hey, face. Where's all

284
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:08,820
this dirt out here? All right. What if I, okay, we got to go to hold onto this one. The next house

285
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:15,960
that's really, really full of trash and dirt and shit. I want to try to put it all in the same room.

286
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:23,429
So when they do the before and after picture, it's even worse. This one's on the outside.

287
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:37,400
Why am I trying to climb? Wait, that's not, why do you have little like escape doors? This is,

288
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:48,840
that's awful. Do these, you can't, these don't even open. This is not, doesn't go to the backyard.

289
00:48:48,840 --> 00:49:01,639
What on earth? Or the front yard. Wait, that's the front yard. I'm not a fan. You don't have to pay

290
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:11,260
me. I'll change those out for you. These are French doors. No, they're not. Are these French windows?

291
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:30,920
This is the last bug. It's not, it's not on the roof. Isn't it? That's a germa door. Sure. Okay.

292
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:40,780
That's, that's fine. It could also be a elegant doggy door. Where's this thing? What do you see

293
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:53,130
this? I don't, I'm, I can't see this. Where is this? Oh, whatever. You got fucking rats in the wall

294
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:03,860
for all. It doesn't matter on the grass up top. I can't reach that far. You made me forget. I was

295
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:14,070
making mac and cheese. Um, that's, uh, what did you kind of leave it on? That just gets better

296
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:21,159
with age. All you guys talk all this shit about like, Oh, I fucking hate making mac and cheese.

297
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:27,239
Every time I make it, it's so runny. What's going on here? Wait, not waiting long enough. You're

298
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:38,519
not patient and you're trying to eat it before it's ready. You let it sit there, stir it up

299
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:43,159
and it'll absorb all the nutrients from, it'll absorb everything. It'll puff up. It'll be thick

300
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:53,219
and greasy and shit. You need to wait. You're not waiting long enough. There's mud all over the bed.

301
00:50:54,179 --> 00:51:08,469
This is the, I found Santa's helper's room. This is just if a dog had his own bedroom.

302
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:13,510
All right. What do you want me to do in here? Clean dirt. 99%. Great. That's fantastic. Where is it?

303
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:34,920
I got it. Uh, nothing in here, right? It's dirt. Shit. I had something to tell you guys today.

304
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:42,619
What was it? What the hell did I have to tell you guys? I had something going on. I had something

305
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:49,880
to say. I had something. I remember like just like shaking my hands, like rubbing my hands,

306
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:57,030
going like, I can't wait to tell them this one. I don't know what it was. Damn. I guess we'll

307
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:13,769
never know. I don't, I don't like a lot of big orange bed sheets. Orange. No. What's the thing

308
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:25,900
about like colors? Orange doesn't, I don't like this. I mean, you remove the two pillows. Never

309
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,579
mind. I was going to say it'll be a giant creamsicle and I like those, but that's not even like,

310
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:41,860
who cares? That's not even funny. Nonsense words. Quick. Just say words. Quick. I mean,

311
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:53,050
uh, what should happen with our schools? Okay. Dark mahogany floor panel in here. Oh, thank God.

312
00:52:53,050 --> 00:53:10,139
It's right here for me. It's foolproof. It's a, it's a prison jumpsuit bed. Words, words, words,

313
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:25,829
words, words. Why does everybody love? What's, what's the obsession with wood? When I see like

314
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:31,349
a nice carpet, I'm like, oh, I like that. It's soft. It stays warm. Your feet aren't cold.

315
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:39,929
Everybody, I don't know what it is. Everybody loves wood. I don't. When you step on wood,

316
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:46,119
you ever, you walk around a house that was predominantly wood. I've lived in one. It's,

317
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:57,110
it's, it's just in every room. I don't, it's like I'm playing basketball in my house. You'll step

318
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:04,150
on a piece of that, a panel somewhere and you'll hear a, like a hundred feet somewhere else in

319
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:18,519
another room. Everybody could always track where you, where you are in a wooden, like wood floors.

320
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:27,670
Like, I know exactly where the fuck you're stepping. I don't want to know that information.

321
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:38,519
I don't want to know how many times you've gone into, into the bathroom. It's easy to clean. Yeah,

322
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:45,000
but I know, but then you get, you obsess over it. It's really nice. Wood is expensive. Real wood,

323
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,400
wooden floors are expensive. So anytime that you drop anything or touch a piece of grease

324
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:55,000
and a small crumb lands on the floor, you grab it. You're like, fuck, lick your finger. No, no,

325
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:02,179
no, no, no, no, no. God, please. Just give me a multicolored shitty carpet that I can just dump

326
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:11,260
shit on. It doesn't even matter and just run a vacuum over it once a year. How many stains

327
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,099
are on that carpet? You will have, you'll never know. There could be a hundred hidden in the

328
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:22,409
fucking awesome carpeted multi fiber colored, just like in there. You can't even tell. I could

329
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:28,489
probably do a full piss onto some of these carpets and have you guys come in and examine it and be

330
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:34,179
like, wow, this is perfectly fine. By the way, every day I could probably piss on it every fucking

331
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:39,980
day for a year. And you would come in and you wouldn't, you had no idea where it was. It would

332
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:48,090
smell. No, it wouldn't. I would bring in somebody in a room. Hey, what do you, what do you think

333
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,929
about this room? It's like, it stinks like piss in here. What's this guy trying to get me to do?

334
00:55:53,349 --> 00:56:00,699
Hey, come on in here. Can you, hey, can you see if you can find it? This? Cause that's all I smell.

335
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:15,210
Okay. Melissa light colored left corner sofa. That's a long one. Mimimo dark coffee table.

336
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:22,099
Where does it want this? Not here. Oh no, they did want a Mimimo dark coffee. Here, here we go.

337
00:56:22,099 --> 00:56:33,739
I wish I had a couch like this. It's just a permanent bed. No matter what, you could just

338
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:47,719
lie on it. Where is this supposed to go? This is, this is why I haven't windows this big sucks.

339
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:58,070
I honestly, this is horrible. You ever want to clean these, these windows just never open.

340
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,829
You have to accept that. If you put one of these here, you put a couch next to a window like that,

341
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:07,269
this is a, you have to accept that it'll never be fucking opened once ever for any reason.

342
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:13,849
And you just hope to God that one day, like four years from now, when you open this,

343
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:18,969
like the dead bugs and rotten leaves that are in here are not enough to make you throw up out the

344
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:24,469
window. Cause then your neighbor will think you're crazy. Why did he just do that? He opened up his

345
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:32,090
window and puked. He has a bathroom. Doesn't he like just puking the bathroom? I don't, it takes

346
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:39,860
longer to open the window. Okay. Coffee table. I'm going to move this shit around. I don't like this

347
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:49,369
at all. I hate this. No TV in here. Fireplace. No, I don't like this. I hate, I hate this house.

348
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:53,929
Then you have the weird separate like fucking dungeon dining room. No, I don't like that.

349
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:58,630
I hate that. Get this wall out of here and get rid of the half of this room. Don't just remove

350
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:11,289
this different floor. No, this is what happens when your house is too big. Cause this is all

351
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:16,119
the furniture that anybody fucking needs in their whole life. So then you end up with like, if you

352
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:21,239
have like a 4,000 square foot house, it's like, okay, we have the biggest couch we could possibly

353
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:36,789
fucking find. Nice. That's all we need. Uh, I guess fill it with plants. You don't have TV right there.

354
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:47,159
That's unbelievable. All right. Place object. Right. Here it is. Told you. Yeah. Good. Put it,

355
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:53,349
put it up here. Right here. How about that? Yeah. It looks good. How many more of these do we want?

356
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:57,349
This is a big one. It's big enough for me to have to get it, get in the way and be smell and

357
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:14,039
get in and rot. Cause I don't take care of it. Unless they're fake. It's just unnecessary shit.

358
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:18,440
Does it look nice? I guess, but it's just, it's unnecessary shit.

359
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:33,400
Therma hates plants. No, I love plants. I love a garden. I love tending to tomatoes. I love growing

360
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:49,739
my own tomatoes and eating them. I love plants. Late dark, my heart. Where, where am I missing?

361
00:59:49,980 --> 01:00:00,250
Oh, here. Oh, okay. Eat a tomato on stream. That's so funny how I have to prove that.

362
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:08,420
If any streamer ever says anything, they have to always prove it on stream. You know, I really

363
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,940
like, uh, I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken. Eat Buffalo chicken on stream. Prove it. Liar.

364
01:00:13,659 --> 01:00:23,739
Okay. Uh, I like, I like, um, I like reading books. Liar. Read a whole book on stream. I,

365
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:28,300
I guarantee you haven't read a book at all this whole year. Oh, okay. I read it on stream. I guess

366
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:43,769
how would you get halogen lamps? He's like, let's get hot. Don't they prove it. Eat a book on stream

367
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:50,650
hanging long bulb. This ain't even our house. I want to, I have a lot of money to buy a house.

368
01:00:50,650 --> 01:01:09,719
I don't care where it's placed. Living room. Why is it? How am I not? Oh, this is good dining

369
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:16,099
room. This is good. All right. I got to go upstairs. Wait, bedroom double bed Hermes.

370
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:37,940
What is double bed Hermes? Stove on stove on. I wish I had an electric stove. I don't like gas

371
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:45,500
stoves. I don't, you guys know me. I don't like gas. It freaks me out. Something about electricity

372
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:56,739
is so much safer to me in my brain than like gas. Think about all like the movies and TV shows and

373
01:01:56,739 --> 01:02:04,309
like scariest things about gas. That shit ignites. Watch out. It's going to explode. What's the worst

374
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:11,000
thing that like electricity that like Will Ferrell like electrocuted himself in the fucking Christmas

375
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,690
movie. This house didn't explode. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Maybe it did. Maybe it did. Did it?

376
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:30,730
You could cause a fire. Yeah, but it's okay. It could, it could cause a fire. Sure. And then

377
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:36,820
the fire will take a little while to spread at least 50 to 60 seconds. Right? If you have like

378
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:43,530
electricity in an oven, if it starts, all right. An explosion is an instant. It explodes your house.

379
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:49,929
Fire is a fire. It starts somewhere and spreads. You have time. Gas in a house. The house explodes.

380
01:02:51,940 --> 01:03:02,170
You don't have time. You, you have enough time to go, oh, you don't have enough. If there's

381
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:07,289
if there's electric, electricity fire, you can be like, all right, get the fucking get out.

382
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:11,849
Let's do something about it. Okay. Out, out, out. Okay. So let's do the get the fire extinguisher.

383
01:03:11,849 --> 01:03:32,500
Like it's not just scream. You guys are fucking crazy. I just don't like gas. Gas scares me.

384
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:37,059
It's something about it. It's like lighter than air. It's like a gas. It like floats around and

385
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:47,460
it just ignited and shit. I don't like gas. It's scary to me. When I think of electricity,

386
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:57,079
I think of like, I think of like energy and, and like a light bulb. When I think of the word

387
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:11,349
gas, I think of or like, what's happening? What's happening? No, no, no, no. Fuck that.

388
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:24,739
Electricities. I'm like, I'm an electricity guy. Like if you hear that or smell gas, it's,

389
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:37,769
it's like immediately that like iPhone fucking like, which by the way, by the fuck do people

390
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:47,079
have that as an alarm? What, what, why do you wake your? Yeah. Like they're that iPhone

391
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:57,349
alert notification thing. Everybody had it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What was it called?

392
01:04:57,349 --> 01:05:22,389
iPhone, iPhone alarm. Like, let's see. Yeah. This. All right. So if, if you smell gas, literally,

393
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:28,780
what goes through my head is this. It's I'm dead. I'm dead in five seconds. I'm going to die in five

394
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:36,730
seconds. Why would you wake up to that? Why would you ever want to rip your fucking head up from

395
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:46,199
bed? It's like you're supposed to wake up easily. It's slowly. Why do people use that for their alarm?

396
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:52,940
That sound only means three or four different things. Look out. There is a fucking tornado.

397
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:59,050
A bomb is going to drop on you. You are under attack or there is an immediate threat that is

398
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:08,309
around you. Why would you want to awake to an immediate threat? Like, oh, hey, like it's a spy

399
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:16,940
moving. You stepped on the red wire thing and now like machine guns are going to shoot at you.

400
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:25,780
You should be awakened to like chirping birds. Don't do this to yourself. It's got 50. I haven't

401
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:30,309
done anything. I've just been walking around and like, look, dude, look at it. Nothing. That's four

402
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:41,639
things. Idiot. We had that guy for five seconds. Somebody. Yeah. A plug boy gave 50 bucks. Thanks

403
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:51,769
plug boy for the huge absurd amount of money. Thank you. That's a lot of money. There's no

404
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:56,570
message or anything, but I, you guys know I don't read bit messages anymore, but that's still an

405
01:06:56,570 --> 01:07:18,789
insane thing to do. Red spies in the base. Prove it. Wake up to birds right now. Okay. What do I

406
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:30,860
have to do? Turn on. Maybe a fuse is blonde. What else is left? Paint the color silver glacier in

407
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:49,449
the bedroom. Bedroom 11. Okay. Bedroom 11. Paint. Yes. My favorite part. Oh, it, it feels, I love

408
01:07:49,449 --> 01:08:11,219
that about when it sucked it all up is the wrong bedroom. This is 11, two, right? 11. This is not

409
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:23,109
the wrong. What do you mean? How many bedrooms do they have here? Is this on the first floor?

410
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:31,819
That's what I'm talking about. You have too much stuff. Get lost in your own house. No, all you need

411
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:41,850
is a toilet, an electric stove and a bed. You don't need, don't all this, all this room. It's just room.

412
01:08:41,850 --> 01:09:00,119
It's room for like the gas. Okay. Here we go. Get rid of this thing. There we are. I just thought

413
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:16,279
somebody gave $50. That was the someone gave $50 noise. It's so relaxing. I'm so glad that I

414
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:24,649
promised to play this today. Oh, you know what I mean? Got to just keep your word. That's my slogan.

415
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:34,069
Germa, keep your word. There's a huge scandal about how I've just, I've lied about everything.

416
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:39,399
My entire campaign was running on telling the truth and nothing I said was, was, was real.

417
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:59,300
Dean Dingus, you can't keep getting, he can't get away with this. Senator Elbertson, keep your word.

418
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:11,220
And then they play during the attack ad campaigns against me. They show how I opened up a guy's

419
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:18,760
house, went in, told him I was going to put a sauna in and then just left and lied and just told

420
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:34,390
him I wasn't going to do it anymore. Do people paint their closets? No. I mean, I thought they did.

421
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:39,350
Thank you, Peter. I thought it was Peter Griffin. Thank you, Peter V. Peter Gruen

422
01:10:39,909 --> 01:10:50,470
for the 10 community subs, actually. Thanks to the 10 subs. Welcome all the new subs. Hey,

423
01:10:50,470 --> 01:11:03,739
what's going on? New subs? Wait, what's in the safe? Forgotten safe in the closet. This must be

424
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:10,779
the forgotten safe of the captain that lived here a hundred years ago after selling the precious notes

425
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:16,489
and jewelry found inside the budget significantly increased. This allows us to plan something more

426
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:27,020
for both the kitchen and the bathroom. I'm on TV right now. I'm on TV. I'm about to go on like a

427
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:36,329
weird prank show adventure. How did you not see this? This is like, it's a giant fucking open

428
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:42,970
safe here that you don't, why would you not see this? Steal the money. I already, I just did.

429
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:58,039
I just did. Wait. Okay. Close this. Paint is done. We can sell this now. All right. We need a bedside

430
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:11,529
table. Well, can I give you some more design choices here? Cause that is an ugly ass bed.

431
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:24,149
There, there we go. Make sure you give me a good review on Yelp. German 985. It's my German 985

432
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:35,130
colors. How's it going to fit in here? This room sucks. How is it supposed to fit in here?

433
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:50,729
Why would you want a bed like this? Okay. Bedside. The bed doesn't fit. It's supposed to be an end

434
01:12:50,729 --> 01:13:10,500
table. This bed only can fit one way and it blocks every door. And we need a lamp. Make sure you get

435
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:33,210
those German 985 colors. What's this? A carpet? Get that German 985 set green. All right. The

436
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:39,479
carpet is there for all the shit that goes under your bed. It's a useless carpet and they want a

437
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:51,350
painting, a big one. Okay. Does anybody feel like, okay, if this was next to your bed and you were

438
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:57,159
sleeping and you're snoring your life away, you know, you're just sleeping and you turn when you

439
01:13:57,159 --> 01:14:01,989
wake up and your eyes, you're pointing this way and you see this. I feel like sometimes I would

440
01:14:01,989 --> 01:14:14,970
actually think I was sleeping on a beach for a second. It would be terrifying. Okay. This one's

441
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:33,189
done. What's next? Oh, a choice. A cupboard shelf and new tiles will be enough. We will utilize the

442
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:43,529
extra budget. Let's go crazy and add a second sink. I want to save the money that I stole.

443
01:14:43,529 --> 01:14:56,069
I'm going to invest that shit. Okay. Modify the walls, wall tiles. Oh yeah. That's right. You have

444
01:14:56,069 --> 01:15:09,899
to actually pick these up. You can have finished. Okay. I can finish the job now. Do we care? I

445
01:15:09,899 --> 01:15:21,859
don't think we care. No, this is just to make money so I can buy my own house. It's coming up

446
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:55,350
here in a minute. Yeah, I'm done. Wait, first I want to fuck their whole shit up. Hold on. I'm

447
01:15:55,350 --> 01:16:08,409
going to put the dining room table in here too. Turn the oven on. No, I'm going to put the, I'll

448
01:16:08,409 --> 01:16:14,899
put the oven in there. That much better in there. When you're watching the game, you're going to have

449
01:16:14,899 --> 01:16:41,899
a nice fucking crisp pizza ready. Okay. I can think about what I want. Okay. Done. I've prepared

450
01:16:41,899 --> 01:16:50,010
you for your yard sale. Complete the job. You may not complete the job, but I got tons of money. I

451
01:16:50,010 --> 01:17:02,939
don't care about the money. I just care about making a statement. Yeah. All you did was remove

452
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:21,159
my things. Here's the, you know, the best part about that was this is how all this bullshit,

453
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:29,130
all the fake like filters and stuff. That was just a filter on the shitty picture. They took

454
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:32,729
a shitty picture and they put a little filter on it to make it look better. It doesn't look like

455
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:40,539
that. I didn't walk in that room. They tried so hard to make how bad that was look. Not as bad,

456
01:17:40,539 --> 01:17:59,460
even though it's just the raw photo. I got $341,000. I'm ready. We need a big one. Um,

457
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:16,119
there's an actual Simpson's house in the game. How do I do that one? I don't know if you can

458
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:23,159
buy the house in the HDTV part. Oh, all right. Property renovation in the rental business. She's

459
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:27,859
expecting a baby. So there's no way she can work as much as usually. I'm going to have to help her

460
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:31,619
with a house for one of her clients. The semi-detached house that requires some work and

461
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:40,630
yeah. Okay. I got a $9,000 budget. You're in story mode. Yeah. I got to unlock all the tools and then

462
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:48,539
I'm going to take those tools into, into free purchase mode. All right. So what does she want?

463
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:54,840
First of all, this has got to change. That's the first, uh, you want, you really need a,

464
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,920
an HDTV specialist to tell you that this is probably not something that this is probably

465
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:05,479
like a, you want like a more neutral color. Well, now we've got a clean slate to work with.

466
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:13,829
All right. Here's an idea. Maybe we should demolish the two walls and knock it down.

467
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:18,260
Knock it down. Knock the whole thing down. The whole thing should be an open floor plan,

468
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:29,779
including the bathrooms. Knock it down. I'm talking square build tool in the Sims.

469
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:49,050
No rooms made. This is just as satisfying as it was before. All right. Well,

470
01:19:49,050 --> 01:20:06,970
I have the sledgehammer feels good. Feels good. It's been a while. It's excessively loud. Yep.

471
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:15,510
The game is excessively loud. Someone has started working on the kitchen already gone with a dark

472
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:21,859
brown paint. Let's add some traditional hanging lamps. No, I hate those. Let's put some bright

473
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:42,489
colors on the walls. Yes, absolutely. Lime green. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean? Well,

474
01:20:42,489 --> 01:20:54,420
what are you doing? I'm doing my interior designing. What are you doing? Besides

475
01:20:54,420 --> 01:21:08,579
criticizing a genius at work. Broken pipe. It looks like the radiator. I wait. Yes. No,

476
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:12,100
it's water. Okay. The leak needs to be stopped. There should be a water supply valve.

477
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:40,279
This is the urgent water, water supply valve. I'm going to hit the gas line. Okay. I'm actually

478
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:45,560
kind of concerned about this because if I hit a gas line and it's an instant gas line explosion,

479
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:50,039
then I'm starting to have a little bit of a scenario here. I don't like this.

480
01:21:50,680 --> 01:22:14,949
If I can hit the water line, then I can hit the gas line. This is the load bearing wall.

481
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:28,170
Yeah. Where's the load bearing wall? There ain't no more walls. The house is just laid on top

482
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:43,500
like a hat. Oh no, the house is coming down. Just delete everything. I'm going to make an open floor.

483
01:22:43,500 --> 01:23:00,470
I'm going to make a completely open Sims 4 renovation. This guy's deranged. Just renovate

484
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:05,350
it as an empty field. Just take the whole house down. So the before and after is just a house and

485
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:21,699
then the house is gone. That's not a renovation. That's a magic trick. Imagine going through all

486
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:28,250
that trouble. What we're going to do is we're going to bulldoze their fucking house and then I'm going

487
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:34,460
to pretend on TV that I made it disappear and I'm just going to cut these people. You know what?

488
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:41,079
I wonder how many times maybe that has happened before. If I was just a millionaire

489
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:47,720
magician, I would just like, here's a check. How much is your house worth?

490
01:23:48,789 --> 01:23:55,500
Oh, the house is worth probably 325,000. I'll give you 400,000 if you let me do a magic trick

491
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:15,500
where I disappear your house. You just go buy one in cash. But I need to do this. You mean destroy

492
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:21,260
it? Yeah. But, but, but it's a magic trick. It's not, I'm not like destroying the house.

493
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:34,619
It's a magic trick. I even use the door. Is it leak? That's fine. Not my problem.

494
01:24:37,239 --> 01:25:04,180
All right. Load bearing wall. Don't touch that one. Can't get rid of this one. It's got an

495
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:14,500
achievement for being an asshole. The achievement I just got is called truly open space. See,

496
01:25:16,729 --> 01:25:24,939
I'm making game progress. What is this? This is like a puppeteer station. There's a wall here,

497
01:25:24,939 --> 01:25:31,510
wall there. This is where the family crouches down and has like puppet night. How can I sell

498
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:43,960
this? Yeah, I'm sorry. If you have a dedicated puppetry room, then I guarantee you, you got five

499
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:49,180
or six big plants in your house. You want to put, you want to make that bet? You want to put that

500
01:25:49,180 --> 01:26:09,239
money down? What are these? Cement. I thought I said gourmet. Gourmet cement. Lights on floor,

501
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:24,550
lights on floor. It's all right. I'm not going to, that's immoral. I can't sell the doors. The doors

502
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:35,659
have to stay, but everything else can be smashed down with a sledgehammer. That's very immoral.

503
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:53,430
Okay. That's it, right? Any more? Move furniture into the water leak. See, hey, if being a psycho

504
01:26:53,430 --> 01:27:09,029
was a strategy game, we would get an S plus on every level. You get that, right? Okay. Is this

505
01:27:09,029 --> 01:27:24,659
the house? Is there any more rooms or anything? Who's we? What do you mean? I'm talking about you.

506
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:32,579
It's you that I'm referring to. Talking about you. All right, cool. Now we want build the walls.

507
01:27:34,659 --> 01:27:50,890
A mountable towel radiator. Toilet? All right. Oh, should I need to mount this toilet?

508
01:27:52,600 --> 01:28:01,819
I can't just jam it in there. Just stick it into the water. Wait, lay wall. Wait, wait, wait. What

509
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:07,899
room am I in? I need a radiator. Towel radiator plumbing system. Right, right, right, right, right.

510
01:28:07,899 --> 01:28:30,840
What is a towel radiator plumbing system? What? Did I read that wrong? No, I want to get that out

511
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:43,369
of the way. Wait, what is this here for? A towel warmer. You don't even need a shower. Just come

512
01:28:43,369 --> 01:28:50,199
into the leaking room and just smush your face over here. It's an indoor pool. Yeah. Somebody gets it.

513
01:28:50,199 --> 01:29:14,199
Okay. Remove object. No. Where's the toilet mount? Move the bathtub onto the leak. Can I move the

514
01:29:14,199 --> 01:29:21,159
bathtub? I can't. I cannot move the bathtub, unfortunately. Click on the link. What even is

515
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:31,399
the toilet really? Wow. This is your room. It's so cool. Yeah. Yep. Why do you always have to use

516
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:39,689
this drunk image? I don't know where these are supposed to go. All right. Mountable. Mountable

517
01:29:39,689 --> 01:30:01,449
towel radiator. What is this? Old Japanese sink. Okay. There we go. Yeah. I fixed one of the leaks.

518
01:30:01,449 --> 01:30:22,470
Where does it go? That's crazy that that's how they make these things. Okay. Cool. What's wrong

519
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:40,470
with this? Assemble. It is assembled. Paint with the colors young flower bud. Uh, young flower bud.

520
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:50,020
All right. Here we go. This is going to be real boring, but I love it. Enable A. Yay. Yay. A. I'm

521
01:30:50,020 --> 01:31:06,899
not going to say it the way it's supposed to be said. It's baby puke yellow. I think this is baby

522
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:12,140
puke baby. This is, I think this is, yeah, this is baby, like baby burp yellow. That's a better way

523
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:28,039
to put it. Why would you? Yeah. Yellow. I mean, it's, I don't know, like an olive. What would you

524
01:31:28,039 --> 01:31:39,220
call it? This is carpet piss. Yeah. That's accurate. That is what it looks. That's an accurate

525
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:49,640
carpet piss color. You're right. Oh, rude. That would be if you told somebody that. Yeah. We had

526
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:55,369
the, we had it painted. We, uh, yeah, we got a painter in here to the bedrooms, did the living

527
01:31:55,369 --> 01:32:02,659
room. This looks like carpet piss yellow. Because if you, when you hear that, you have to really

528
01:32:02,659 --> 01:32:07,399
think about it because it doesn't make any sense at first. And then you think about what an old

529
01:32:07,399 --> 01:32:18,789
piss would look like as a big gross circle. And then you would see it and you would know. And then

530
01:32:18,789 --> 01:32:35,720
you get angry. It angers you. Then you pretend to like it. And then eventually you pretend to like

531
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:42,659
it for so long that you're just like, yeah, it's cool. I like it. It's fine. You know what I really

532
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:51,319
do miss though? Oh, I missed my spearmint green gamer room. I love that color. I might, I got it.

533
01:32:51,319 --> 01:32:58,550
I want, I want like a spearmint green room again. Oh, I love it so much. It's like my favorite color.

534
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:15,050
Okay. So now we need, uh, lay wall tiles and white mosaic hexagon. Wait, it's just right here. What?

535
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:30,380
Hexagon. What's it called? White mosaic hexagon. Right. I was supposed to go. Oh yeah. That's right.

536
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:37,659
This is, this is a room. Olive greens. My favorite color. Wait, this is not right. The room is just

537
01:33:37,659 --> 01:34:01,270
going. Just testing each room. Which, which room is it going? Wall tiles. Shit. Hold on. Modify what?

538
01:34:02,899 --> 01:34:21,739
Dark gray mosaic? No, I thought it was white mosaic. Shit. No, that's not right either.

539
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:39,939
I could draw a penis. Modify walls. What? Here we go. Why is that not working? Eight out of 10.

540
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:56,229
Put this away. Throw this away. I don't want this. I have to get rid of them. It's because

541
01:34:56,229 --> 01:35:06,970
I demolished all the walls. I actually kind of like that. It gives off the like in the pool.

542
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:16,760
That's like the side of a pool. I really like that. Okay. Let's go. White tiles. 25 of them. Good.

543
01:35:17,319 --> 01:35:32,539
This is a bathroom house. That's a good idea. God damn it. Am I going to get like addicted

544
01:35:32,539 --> 01:35:37,449
to house slipper again? I think I might. I don't know. Are we, are we going to be streaming this

545
01:35:37,449 --> 01:35:44,409
tomorrow? Oh no. What have you done? Why did you remind me that I promised to play this?

546
01:35:44,890 --> 01:36:06,020
You know what happens? I get stuck here. That's enough, right? Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. He said that

547
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:15,619
that's the best streams. I love this game. This game is so simple and it's so basic,

548
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:25,880
but it's like the best game and real. I love this game. This has to be my favorite game

549
01:36:26,439 --> 01:36:33,270
in the last five years. Isn't that fucked up? That sounds like it's something you shouldn't say out

550
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:47,579
loud. What's come out in the last five years? I got to paint some, wait, I'm going to paint this

551
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:57,989
wall in here. Lay tiles, wallpaper with bamboo. All right. Hold on. Paint. Okay. Young flower bud

552
01:36:57,989 --> 01:37:07,079
needs a little bit more space. What about a half-life game? But that's like, what do you mean

553
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:19,960
the last five years? Half-life Alex? I haven't played half-life Alex though. So how can I compare

554
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:40,329
it? This doesn't count as a wall. Okay. There we go. 73, 24, 75, 76, 77. Play half-life Alex. I'm

555
01:37:40,329 --> 01:37:43,689
going to, don't worry. I'm going to go back to VR. I'm going to go back to VR. It's going to be a

556
01:37:43,689 --> 01:37:51,619
big VR day, big VR week. I'm going to play all that shit. You're going to trust me. All right.

557
01:37:51,619 --> 01:37:57,800
Wall tiles in the bathroom. Or should I do light? Okay. Light biscuits going to be in here.

558
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:18,220
Just do that now. Ooh, I like that. You're pogged. Look at that. What? You're pogged?

559
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:32,039
Why is that clippable? Clippable. He always keeps his word. I try to. Thank you. I really

560
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:42,970
appreciate that you coming in saying that. Real voice. Yeah. This is like kind of great.

561
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:47,529
If you called me at like six o'clock in the afternoon and I answered the phone, I'd be like,

562
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:56,539
what's up? Be like this. Hey, what's going on? What are you doing? Nah, nothing. Sorry. I might

563
01:38:56,539 --> 01:39:02,460
sound a little hoarse. I was acting on Twitch for a while. Yeah. You play Mario Maker 2 yet, dude?

564
01:39:03,159 --> 01:39:09,430
Yeah, that's fucking suck. It's a wicked good acting game. Yeah. Come over. You can come over

565
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:16,979
like an hour. Fucking tired from, you know, missing a jump over and over again. But it

566
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:35,109
fucking kills on Twitch, man. Dark gray mosaic. Where are these going to go? Is he from Boston?

567
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:44,539
Yeah. That's kind of where I fucking grew up, dude. I live. I live in Vegas now, but I was a

568
01:39:44,539 --> 01:39:52,500
fucking big Boston guy before I moved here. And you know what? It's still with me every day.

569
01:39:52,500 --> 01:40:23,029
This is just the drug chair. Oh, hey guys. Okay. I think I'm good. Stare at the wall. Okay.

570
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:55,319
Open the window. It stinks in here. What am I doing? I still have $8,000 of a budget. I'm

571
01:40:55,319 --> 01:41:01,960
going to put an expensive chair in here. There's a garage too. All right. What's this a bed?

572
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:33,909
Let's make it an invisible bed. I can't. I'm not going to be able to fit it. It can't go in like

573
01:41:33,909 --> 01:41:49,640
that. What are you a lizard? Yeah. Well, you know, I am a fucking lizard. So I have to have

574
01:41:50,439 --> 01:41:55,930
moisture in the bedroom at all times. My wife, you still have to spray me with a bottle.

575
01:41:56,949 --> 01:42:05,800
This is a much better solution. I think. All right. Would you let me ask you again,

576
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:10,600
would you be able to do that? Would you be able to sleep like this? That's a challenge. I'm not

577
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:21,369
sure I would be able to. If you were wicked tired and the water wasn't cold, it was exactly at like

578
01:42:21,369 --> 01:42:26,329
68 degrees. It was like 70 degree water, completely isotonic. It had enough sodium.

579
01:42:27,319 --> 01:42:32,600
It's an isotonic solution. Would you be able to sleep with that if that was not pointed at your

580
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:38,600
face? And there was like a doctor and a scientist and like a construction worker that were ready

581
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:44,920
to like, Hey, like we got to get them out of there. Do you think you'd be able to fall asleep?

582
01:42:46,489 --> 01:42:50,729
No, no, not hypothermia. That is, this is an isotonic solution. It has like the right amount

583
01:42:50,729 --> 01:43:07,720
of sodium, nitrogen, hydrogen, everything, human blood. It's isotonic. Look it up. Okay. That's

584
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:18,699
good. Am I getting money points for this? Let me check. Look down there. Progress. I'm not,

585
01:43:18,699 --> 01:43:26,739
I'm not getting any progress. Okay. Lay wall tiles, wallpaper with bamboo. Where is that going to go?

586
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:43,029
Dark gray hexagon. I must have burped really loud. Dark gray hexagon mosaic. Do you mean credit

587
01:43:43,029 --> 01:44:01,029
score? Wait, what did I say? I don't remember. This is not even right. It's free credit report.com.

588
01:44:01,029 --> 01:44:06,859
I'm lying down here seeing all this in this restaurant. They monitor your credit and give

589
01:44:06,859 --> 01:44:18,229
you free email alerts and put it on your sweatshirt and you see the t-shirts. Shit. Now you all heard

590
01:44:18,229 --> 01:44:27,380
it. It worked like 20, like 15 years later. It's still worked. Congratulations. It's still fucking

591
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:33,220
worked. Good work. Ad campaign team. You deserve, all of you deserve to get at least a 20, 30 percent

592
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:41,829
raise. All of you, wherever you are now. I don't care where you are. And that band. I hope they,

593
01:44:41,829 --> 01:44:45,750
I hope they're absolutely killing it. I hope the last EP they dropped has like fucking 500 million

594
01:44:45,750 --> 01:45:02,020
plays on Spotify. I really hope that. All right. Now paint with the natural beige. The band broke

595
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:10,970
up after the commercials. Oh, that's really sad. That makes me feel bad. Really? No. Did they?

596
01:45:11,289 --> 01:45:30,539
Okay. All I just read was all the, like everyone's talking about this band and then somebody just

597
01:45:30,539 --> 01:45:50,250
wrote, this is a fucking mess. Holy shit. No, I'm not. Okay. Paint with the natural base. Six percent.

598
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:58,300
What do you mean six percent? There's not enough walls in this house to do this. Wait, is there

599
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:16,520
another house? Oh Jesus Christ. This is second house. Wait, no. What? House two? No, there's not

600
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:23,579
enough walls. There are not enough walls in this house. Is there a house three?

601
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:39,819
Jerma, you're a fucking idiot. You broke the walls. Right. You're right. Okay. Well, why can't I just?

602
01:46:39,819 --> 01:46:50,869
Okay. I have a solution. We need to build five walls. More than that. Where's the build tool?

603
01:46:50,869 --> 01:47:07,210
Okay. We need just enough room to be able to paint on all sides. That's four. This is four, eight,

604
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:17,979
12, 16, 20. Okay. Build a maze. That's another one I could do. I could build a maze. I'm gonna build

605
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:24,380
a maze in one of the, all right. Welcome to fucking house flipper week. I'm sorry. I think maybe at

606
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:31,880
least a thousand people just put their hands in the air when, god damn it. Okay. So what do I need?

607
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:48,550
Beige. Do beige first. Natural beige. Five percent. Six percent. These ones have to be beige. All right.

608
01:47:48,550 --> 01:48:01,979
Where's the beige? Pipers. God damn it. Yeah. If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve

609
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:20,250
my cat puke noise. Come on, guys. 12 percent. Is this? I can't tell this is working. Is my grand

610
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:46,020
scheme actually working? I think so. Because this is technically 14 percent. Yeah, it is working.

611
01:48:46,020 --> 01:49:00,859
Carpet piss omega lull house. This is gonna be such a pain in the ass. This is gonna be such a

612
01:49:00,939 --> 01:49:10,250
pain in the ass. Get rid of this chair. Get rid of this stuff. I need, okay. 18 percent. Shit.

613
01:49:12,439 --> 01:49:34,300
I have to build so many more walls that are separated. Build them all together? Will that

614
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:46,520
be more space? But like, we can do that. Yep. We can do, we can, all right. We can do like a McRib

615
01:49:46,520 --> 01:50:09,210
system. That works. Yeah, it works. That'll be way more surface to paint. Nuclear reactor house.

616
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:28,300
It's very funny. Like, large generator. Build them outside. Did they add that in house flipper?

617
01:50:28,859 --> 01:50:37,180
I remember you couldn't do that before. Do it outside. Wait, can you build outside? Can you?

618
01:50:37,819 --> 01:50:48,520
How the fuck is this still 15 percent? This is beige, right? Light biscuit? No, this is wrong.

619
01:50:50,619 --> 01:51:01,770
Natural beige. That's not it either. Oh, god damn it. Buy another one. Buy like three of them.

620
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:14,199
That's, that's light biscuit. Okay, there we go. Now we're going, now we're cooking with gas.

621
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:44,489
Not scary! Is that loud? Is that really loud? I'm sorry if it was. No? All right, I'm sorry if it was.

622
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:53,369
Sorry. Okay, 25 percent. Can I build this shit outside? I don't think I can, guys. Wait,

623
01:51:55,699 --> 01:52:04,979
does this not count? No, no build tool. I can't. Remember, you're so loud. Everyone always yells at

624
01:52:04,979 --> 01:52:11,109
me because they say I'm too quiet and now everyone says I'm loud. Okay, we're gonna need some more

625
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:20,060
walls. What are we at? 20 what percent? Late wall tiles. Okay, wait, wallpaper with bamboo. Let's do

626
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:38,789
that because I know I can do that like over here. I don't need very much of this. One guy. Get rid

627
01:52:38,789 --> 01:52:55,880
of this. I don't want this. There we are. Okay, how many do I need? 11. Something's in my eye.

628
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:13,859
Something's in my eye. Something's in my eye. All right, we're good. Four, five, six, seven,

629
01:53:15,579 --> 01:53:28,229
eight. Am I trying to make it look like my house is a plant? Nine. Look, these are my roots. Like,

630
01:53:28,229 --> 01:53:50,619
I have roots going down. N and 11. White mosaic hexagon. Oh, whoops. Not it. How much budget do

631
01:53:50,619 --> 01:53:57,220
I have? I stole a lot of money from somebody, right? I want to put this shit down. I don't

632
01:53:57,220 --> 01:54:14,310
want to hold this anymore. Going on the outside. Okay, where am I missing this? Where's the white?

633
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:29,640
Okay, I see. Build one of these. Beige. Mountable towel radiator. Well, that's that right there.

634
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:39,750
All right, sell this shit. Get this out of here. So, I need to build the walls. Didn't I already

635
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:59,159
build five walls? Shower bed. You need... All right, who made the dumb joke that got him started on

636
01:54:59,159 --> 01:55:05,739
this awful house? I don't think anybody did. Nobody did. This wasn't some kind of joke or,

637
01:55:05,739 --> 01:55:23,159
well, let's do this. No, I don't think so, at least. That's all I had to do. Why is that in here?

638
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:34,310
Isn't that kind of a weird place to have that? Okay, sink. Turn it back on. I can't turn it back

639
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:52,310
on. Turn it... I don't... I didn't know what it did. It was just a random valve. Quick, break it again.

640
01:55:52,310 --> 01:56:11,460
That's not going to work. Wait, it might. Hold on. No, it's gone. Let it go. All right, let's finish

641
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:24,390
this. How I still not made this much progress? The garage. Okay, it's the trash in the garage

642
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:59,100
that's killing me. All right, now... That's it. Garage is clean. Decorations. This guy's got like

643
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:13,529
a Rube Goldberg machine in his house. Whenever he turns on the garage, it's like... It's like an egg

644
01:57:13,529 --> 01:57:36,680
that just drops and scrolls around the gears. Wait, they're just big ones? Damn it. I can

645
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:45,670
make a gear house. Shit. Okay, remind me of that later. Remind me of that later. Not now. I'll do

646
01:57:45,670 --> 01:58:07,180
it later. No, we need like a couch in here. Furniture. Table. Minecraft jumping event. Bunk beds.

647
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:12,899
They added bunk beds. They added bunk beds. This is the greatest day ever. They added bunk beds.

648
01:58:12,899 --> 01:58:48,460
What's my WCW? Like wrestling? WCW. What do you want to click on? Women Crush Wednesday. LOL,

649
01:58:48,460 --> 01:59:06,600
I choose Ursula. The top reply here is, oh god, you're drunk again. And then I replied saying,

650
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:20,140
haha, I'm not. I just have this super WCW on Ursula. Why did I do this? What's wrong with you?

651
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:36,199
Good crush. Okay, so why are you linking this to me? I got a tweet I made like four years ago.

652
01:59:42,329 --> 01:59:47,850
I don't... I don't... Hey, Jeremy, maybe you said this like on Twitter five years ago.

653
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:59,239
Remember this video, this specific moment that happened in video 225 in 2012? I don't even

654
01:59:59,239 --> 02:00:06,460
remember what I had for lunch yesterday. I don't even know. I have... I don't remember what it was.

655
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:14,649
I don't know these things that I say. That's a humble brag. Forgetting what you ate for lunch

656
02:00:14,649 --> 02:00:27,590
yesterday is concerning. That's not a humble brag. It's Wednesday. Is it still Ursula?

657
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:36,920
All right, let me just focus on my HD... HDTV. I need to wait. What do I have to do? Okay,

658
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:46,329
this is broken. This. I gotta mount a sink here. What kind of sink do they want? Build the walls.

659
02:00:46,329 --> 02:01:06,500
I have to build these walls, right? I don't know what the fuck they want. ADHDGTV. What is ADHDGTV?

660
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:12,920
Is that like the guy renovates a house but he cannot decide on the color of the couch he wants

661
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:23,850
so he keeps getting it upholstered for the whole episode and that's it. This is a guy paints like

662
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:34,840
half of the house and then just kind of starts watching TV. Basically, it's this stream. No,

663
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:45,020
it's not. This is not what I would do if I was on HGTV. Walls. What do they want these walls?

664
02:01:46,100 --> 02:02:05,619
Build wall. Modify the room's layout. Isn't that what I'm doing? It's the green on the map.

665
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:25,449
Oh, it won't. Right. Okay. Wait, that's not even it. What the fuck is that for? You just built an

666
02:02:25,449 --> 02:02:44,220
annoying wall? It's a wall. Yeah, I know what it is but why is it? It sticks out too far. Okay,

667
02:02:44,220 --> 02:03:02,819
we need young flower bud or a booger beige. I'm gonna go with booger beige. Place little walls

668
02:03:02,899 --> 02:03:12,710
on the ceiling. Paint with beige. How much of their room do they house? They want beige.

669
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:20,380
You guys thought I was boring. 75 out of 80 with the other one. Where's the green one?

670
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:49,930
What's it called? This one. Just complete the ones that can be completed. Okay. Wall with bamboo.

671
02:03:52,739 --> 02:04:19,930
Alright. Closing one door, opening two more. There it is. That made no sense. Yeah, it did.

672
02:04:19,930 --> 02:04:32,600
How do I drop shit? Press E to pick up the $60. Here we go. Alright, look. I'm gonna fix this.

673
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:51,510
Check it out. Alright. Lay floor tiles. Floor panel pine. You got it? Floor panel pine. Alright.

674
02:04:51,510 --> 02:05:04,739
About right here. 2%. I think the entire house is supposed to be like this. How would you have room

675
02:05:04,739 --> 02:05:23,220
for anything else? It's only 27%. 32%? Is the bathroom pine wood? This is the worst house I've

676
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:29,289
made. I didn't make this house. Remember, gotta get it right here. I didn't make this house. I'm

677
02:05:29,289 --> 02:05:35,239
just getting money to be able to do my own house. This is me renovating somebody else's. And yes,

678
02:05:35,239 --> 02:05:50,390
I took the money up front. This is horrible. Regardless of how much I fucked this whole thing

679
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:55,689
up, that doesn't matter. This whole house is a wood floor. The entire thing, the same color,

680
02:05:55,689 --> 02:06:18,979
everything. Even in the bathroom? Only 50% so far. How? Do you want me to put wood floor on the roof?

681
02:06:18,979 --> 02:06:36,979
66%. This is so stupid. 80%. It's because I made everything one room. So I'm never gonna be able

682
02:06:36,979 --> 02:06:49,300
to complete all the tasks. Please. What do you want? What? What is it? Guys, you're not gonna

683
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:58,869
believe this. Hey, woozledoo is in my bedroom. I wish I was in your bedroom. Yeah, what? What do

684
02:06:58,869 --> 02:07:20,390
you want me to say? Wrong link. Wait, is this the go-through Jerma's Twitter comedy hour?

685
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:31,239
Let's go, let's go to like 2012 and find some comedy. All right, that's it. That's Team YouTube

686
02:07:31,239 --> 02:07:37,319
Money's new album cover. Here's the story of that. That Team YouTube Money was the name. I didn't

687
02:07:37,319 --> 02:07:44,460
pick the name. The name was already there. We got called in from the benches because, uh, I believe

688
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:48,939
if I get the story right, I want to get the story right. I think the incredible orb legally couldn't

689
02:07:48,939 --> 02:07:57,399
participate in the United States in that shoot mania tournament. So we had, we were like the

690
02:07:57,399 --> 02:08:04,390
bench players that came in. If I remember that correctly, like it was supposed to be like orb

691
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:10,970
was in like the tournament or something. Then we were like, at least I was like the B team. It was,

692
02:08:10,970 --> 02:08:21,159
I was the, I was the anchor. You guys don't remember that? That's okay. A long time ago,

693
02:08:21,159 --> 02:08:26,279
like 10 years, eight years ago or so now, seven years ago, I played in a shoot mania storm

694
02:08:26,279 --> 02:08:36,409
tournament and we almost won the whole thing. It was streamed. This was streamed like seven and a

695
02:08:36,409 --> 02:08:44,069
half years ago. And what it really came down to was MLC stealth just carried us all the way to

696
02:08:44,069 --> 02:08:50,380
the final fucking round. Star was pretty good too. It was me star and MLC stealth, but it was supposed

697
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:54,939
to be, I think me, no, it was supposed to be star like MLC stealth and orb, but like he couldn't,

698
02:08:54,939 --> 02:09:00,489
they like legally wasn't allowed to participate because he wasn't a US citizen or something.

699
02:09:00,489 --> 02:09:14,539
Here's a video of it. Yeah, it was a big deal. I was an actual, yeah, a gaming warlord. Yeah,

700
02:09:14,539 --> 02:09:20,859
gaming anchor. Eric, you gotta have an anchor on the boat. MLC stealth was like the sails.

701
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:30,220
Star was like the solid wood and I was the anchor and be careful. You want to go on a fucking trip

702
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:35,350
without an anchor with a boat. What if a storm comes? What if you need to drop that anchor hard

703
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:53,109
into the ground? I'm here. I'm here to, I'm ready. The train needs a caboose. Please just make the

704
02:09:53,109 --> 02:10:08,300
house less bad. Actual literal dead weight. All right, let me finish this. Let me finish this,

705
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:19,800
please. This looks like the house from Hellraiser. No, no. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

706
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:25,460
I need to, let me finish this first. I don't even, you know, I'm laughing at that, but I don't even

707
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:29,699
know what they're talking about. I haven't seen the movie in so long. I just hear the word Hellraiser

708
02:10:29,699 --> 02:10:32,979
and I think of the guy with like the needles in his face and I'm just like, holy shit, this probably

709
02:10:32,979 --> 02:10:39,699
looked horrible then. And then that cube that bites you, right? And it needs to like you drink

710
02:10:39,699 --> 02:10:50,630
your blood and then go take a portal. I don't even remember that movie. What's next? Mountable toilet

711
02:10:50,630 --> 02:11:01,899
fire fairy. Okay, I need mountable toilet furry. A toilet fairy. I don't think I want to know

712
02:11:01,899 --> 02:11:20,569
about that. What is it? Toilet fairy? Mountable toilet fairy. Nice. Okay, too bad we couldn't

713
02:11:20,569 --> 02:11:25,449
like lift this up another water go in there. That's just a complete and total. Oh, okay.

714
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:41,319
Old fashioned sink. Where's it supposed to even go? Is it actually supposed to go right here?

715
02:11:41,880 --> 02:12:06,310
Oh, I don't think I can even assemble this. Here comes the toilet fairy. What would that even be?

716
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:15,130
Like you have the tooth fairy. The tooth fairy, if you lose a tooth. Hey, the tooth fairy left a

717
02:12:15,130 --> 02:12:22,579
dollar under your pillow. Does the toilet fairy leave a dollar in the toilet after like you took

718
02:12:22,579 --> 02:12:34,550
a dump in it? How come I can't close this thing out? Am I doing this wrong? Why? How come I can't

719
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:45,899
do this? I'm sorry, that was weird. Okay, short narrow curtain. I'm assuming for the bathtub

720
02:12:45,899 --> 02:13:14,699
thing here. Short narrow curtain. Multiple, mountable wide curtain. That's not for the bathtub.

721
02:13:14,699 --> 02:13:29,260
Mountable wide curtain. What is this? Oh, it goes up here. There's not enough room to place it. How?

722
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:46,279
Oh, come on. All right. We're almost it doesn't matter. Place object. What does it want me to

723
02:13:46,279 --> 02:13:58,949
place tasks? Nothing in the garage, right? Okay, I have to place these objects. We're almost there.

724
02:13:58,949 --> 02:14:07,659
Get it. All right. We're there. We're there. We're there. We're there. Okay. We're done. Done. Done.

725
02:14:07,659 --> 02:14:19,659
Done. Done. Done. Done. I can do it. Let's go. The job is complete. Let's see the before and after.

726
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:48,119
The garage looks nice. It doesn't look that bad. Oh, mega lol. The bucket. The bucket of paint. Yeah.

727
02:14:48,119 --> 02:14:52,470
Jerma, Jerma, stop wasting channel points. They're going to be so valuable.

728
02:14:53,029 --> 02:15:01,829
Eventually, that's what my excuse lead to the Simpsons house. Let me see if there's any new

729
02:15:01,829 --> 02:15:17,340
houses to buy. I got 350 grand mail. No, I'm not doing this. Wait, look for like Bart Simpson

730
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:28,970
or something, right? Do I have an email from Bart Simpson? No. Damn it. Like writing a letter to

731
02:15:28,970 --> 02:15:35,930
Santa Claus and expecting him to write back. I sent Rocco from Rocco's Modern Life a thank you

732
02:15:35,930 --> 02:15:49,699
letter. I liked his show, but he didn't write me back. All right. The game's going to really open

733
02:15:49,699 --> 02:16:03,560
up here when I'm done with tutorial house four. We're going to do this quick. That's until he was

734
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:08,460
released. Yeah. All right. Ed purchased the small house on sale. The couple that was selling the

735
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:14,699
house split up during the renovation. So some furniture is brand new. Our house is messy.

736
02:16:14,699 --> 02:16:18,300
Ed has some doubts when it comes to choosing which of the existing solutions should be carried over.

737
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:27,189
Sure. All right. Let's go quick. Clean everything. Get this trash out of here.

738
02:16:27,189 --> 02:16:42,139
And then we're going to make our dream house. The maze. I have garden flipper too. Where's my

739
02:16:42,139 --> 02:17:00,149
lawnmower? No lawnmower? Remember the lawnmower? The lawnmower sucked. It was so hard to control.

740
02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:21,379
All right. That's the whole front yard is good. This is very messy. You're right. What are these?

741
02:17:21,379 --> 02:17:31,350
Wait, I thought these were like silicone gel packs. What are these? Is this water? How did you get

742
02:17:31,350 --> 02:17:56,659
this much water on the couch? On the shower? Huh? How's the bathroom doing? The bathroom doesn't need

743
02:17:56,659 --> 02:18:04,069
anything. Quick. Make a piss carpet. Okay. Make a decision. What is it? This one's going to be quick.

744
02:18:04,969 --> 02:18:09,209
But leather furniture is stylish. Let's keep what we have. We will choose furniture in a similar

745
02:18:09,209 --> 02:18:15,290
style. Um, no, I don't like leather couches and leather stuff. You can ruin it too easily.

746
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:18,010
Give me the thing that can be wiped off with a towel if you dump a whole coffee on it.

747
02:18:18,819 --> 02:18:35,379
Uh, let's go modern. Leather arm. I don't want leather. Alfred leather armchair. Okay. Paint.

748
02:18:35,379 --> 02:18:47,459
Okay. Steel gray. 180. This is the kind of house I'm talking about. I'm going to love this place.

749
02:18:51,610 --> 02:18:59,659
Gray. Gray. Everything gray. And then one piece of blue furniture. You will impress the shit at

750
02:18:59,659 --> 02:19:11,239
anybody. Ready? Gray walls. A light blue couch. And have maybe a little bit like of a dark blue

751
02:19:12,219 --> 02:19:22,090
accent. And you better make damn sure that you have something nautical on the wall. Picture of a

752
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:35,239
beach or sailor's cap or hanging on the wall. It's a prison architect. It's a Spongebob prison.

753
02:19:35,239 --> 02:19:51,430
How is that a Spongebob prison? True. True. True. True. All right. Hold on. We got,

754
02:19:51,430 --> 02:19:58,100
all right. Link cool down begins now. Link cool down begins now.

755
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:24,920
Every single, every single one. German look at a stream like, because what's a VTuber? I'm sorry.

756
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:30,969
I'm really bad at doing a Boston accent. I was just going to say, what is this?

757
02:20:32,409 --> 02:20:40,090
All right. For a second, I don't know why my brain is just wired wrong in some places. I thought,

758
02:20:40,090 --> 02:20:44,899
I see this is, I see the tweet. It's German nine eight five out of context. I was like, German.

759
02:20:44,899 --> 02:20:50,940
Okay. I click it and I'm like, is that me? I was like, I didn't went German, German out of context.

760
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:57,059
I was like, did I do that at some point? Then I was like, no, that's, that's not me.

761
02:21:01,459 --> 02:21:13,500
Sure. I wonder how do you get like an avatar? Do I do like an avatar stream? If I were to do

762
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:18,809
an avatar stream, I would kind of want to get like a custom one where it was just like a big green

763
02:21:18,809 --> 02:21:30,389
slime and the whole stream. I'm just like role playing as the slime ball guy. That's just like,

764
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:42,940
I, I like to take breaks every like 10 minutes. Is that Mr. Green's slime guy?

765
02:21:43,899 --> 02:22:04,260
Hey, welcome to twitch.tv slash slime guy TV. Mr. Green's evolved. I have to look into that.

766
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:19,659
That sounds, that actually sounds like fun. All right. Well, let's, let's start there. I don't,

767
02:22:19,659 --> 02:22:27,879
I kind of do. I kind of don't though. I, I, here's what I know. I know that I just said,

768
02:22:27,879 --> 02:22:39,299
I want to do Mr. Green's as the slime guy. I get it. I understand. Thanks for that. He knows.

769
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:46,940
You're going to stop that. I'm not doing that voice. That's not me that we're watching a video.

770
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:55,879
Oh, there's no video on screen. So that is just, that's just a voice talking.

771
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:13,819
All right. Slime guy, slime guy avatar stream. I think I'm going to do it on a different channel.

772
02:23:15,129 --> 02:23:20,579
You know what I mean? Would you guys care? Would you guys be mad if I started a new channel called

773
02:23:20,579 --> 02:23:27,459
like the fucking slime guy or something? And I just like told you guys, like you guys knew,

774
02:23:27,459 --> 02:23:38,309
like I just did it and it didn't stream on German. It wasn't even me. I don't think I would tell you

775
02:23:38,309 --> 02:23:43,159
guys when I was going to do it. I think that's, yeah, I wouldn't tell you guys when I won't even

776
02:23:43,159 --> 02:23:53,639
tell you guys the account. So I'm going to stream as the fucking slime guy and you're never going

777
02:23:53,639 --> 02:23:59,340
to even know. And I'm going to stream to nobody. I'm going to take like, I'm going to take like a

778
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:09,979
fucking week off and just stream as that guy. He's going to have 10 viewers.

779
02:24:15,850 --> 02:24:28,790
How much more gray do I need? We're going to find you. I bet you will.

780
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:37,659
What if it happened to Bugleberry week? Yeah, this is kind of an evolution of that. I think

781
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:54,940
this is an evolution of that V tuber. And then I can, and then I can just,

782
02:24:54,940 --> 02:25:01,860
I would just be like a different person. Like German nine at five has his life and his friends,

783
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:15,579
but fucking Mr. Slime. I'll be, I'll be a fucking V tuber. You guys will come in and tell me all

784
02:25:15,579 --> 02:25:19,579
this like fucked up shit that the, that Mr. Slimes did. And I'll just be like, I don't know.

785
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:25,780
Perfect example. I used to use grandpa as a way to swear on the channel 10 years ago.

786
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:33,659
So, oh yeah, I'm ready for this one. Do you remember that? Cause it wasn't me. It was grandpa.

787
02:25:33,659 --> 02:25:38,889
Oh, I didn't say that. I didn't say shut the fuck up. You fucking stupid idiots.

788
02:25:38,889 --> 02:25:42,170
None of you guys have any idea what you're talking about. Like, no, that wasn't me. That was,

789
02:25:42,170 --> 02:25:51,739
I could say whatever I wanted. And then I was just nice, Mr. Nice guy, Jeremy. It ain't me.

790
02:25:51,739 --> 02:26:20,340
It's Mr. Slime. Slimey motherfucker. Yeah. And if anybody followed me, you better,

791
02:26:20,899 --> 02:26:28,280
you better not say a single thing in chat besides talking about how disgusting Mr. Slime is.

792
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:36,700
I want you all to hate watch that stream. That's just going to go off and everyone just like be

793
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:43,579
wicked mean. This guy's a fucking idiot. Oh, Mr. Slime, what a piece of shit. Oh,

794
02:26:43,579 --> 02:26:53,379
he's gross. Look, he just like shot boogers and just, I don't want a chat room. I'll be like

795
02:26:53,379 --> 02:27:01,989
banning people and shit and talking tons of shit. It's not even me. I'm, I,

796
02:27:01,989 --> 02:27:08,340
Jerma hasn't streamed in like four or five days. It's not me. Now here's the real kicker here.

797
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:15,620
What if Mr. Slime becomes more popular than Jeremy? What do I do then? That's kind of what

798
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:27,450
I'm afraid of. And then I have to stop being Jerma and like retire as Jerma and then be Mr.

799
02:27:27,450 --> 02:27:51,750
Slime. It'd be Hannah Montana. Oh, well, we'll see. I definitely want to like figure that out

800
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:57,020
though. That would be kind of fun. What would the voice, what would VTuber voice, what would

801
02:27:57,020 --> 02:28:01,100
the voice be? I'd have the effects thing on. It would be something, it would be something fucking

802
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:15,750
gross. It'd be like something like this. I'd be like, shut up. Shut up and get out of here.

803
02:28:15,750 --> 02:28:30,420
Get slimed. And that would, I would, that's the person I would be banning. Okay. It is far too

804
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:34,979
big for this interior. Let's replace it with something. I hope it becomes more popular than

805
02:28:34,979 --> 02:28:43,930
me. I do. I really hope so. I hope, I hope Mr. Slime, I hope Green, Mr. Green Greens becomes a

806
02:28:43,930 --> 02:28:53,180
huge star. Do you keep it? This piece of how, yeah, keep it. I don't want to do anything.

807
02:28:53,180 --> 02:29:06,139
Fuck doing the work. I like Mr. Slime's more than I like Jerma already. Well, good. Yeah, go make

808
02:29:06,139 --> 02:29:21,139
him famous. Okay. I thought it said hang a bathtub. That's fucked up. Okay. Hanging long bulb.

809
02:29:21,139 --> 02:29:42,569
Okay. Rectangular carpet crossy. Uh, grabby bus chandelier. This ain't even my house. This is just

810
02:29:42,569 --> 02:29:46,709
a tutorial. What are you going to do? I'm not going to tell you when the fuck that's happening.

811
02:29:51,049 --> 02:29:58,840
No, I don't care. Guys, I don't care if I waste like 25 fucking hours of my life. I don't even

812
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:20,309
care. I'm never going to tell you where it is. Enormous wooden table. I mean, this is all just

813
02:30:20,309 --> 02:30:27,540
supposed to go in here. So we're just doing this for the money. Mr. Slime waiting room.

814
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:41,979
Well, this is a pretty enormous leather sofa. What am I missing here? Oh, remove, remove,

815
02:30:41,979 --> 02:31:00,520
get it out of here. Okay. Oakey light colored chairs, six of them. Slime, slime, slime.

816
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:06,729
You know, like doing the Mr. Slime stream once a week or once every like couple of weeks,

817
02:31:06,729 --> 02:31:12,489
like that'd be a great stress reliever. It would just be me just flying off the fucking handle,

818
02:31:12,489 --> 02:31:26,329
like just talking shit. What a, what an outlet for me. This is the coffee table.

819
02:31:26,329 --> 02:31:31,049
I need like, anything I, anything I need to say or get off my chest. I have just the slime.

820
02:31:31,049 --> 02:31:45,940
And I'd be a mod for the slime guy. I don't, we're not taking slime guy applications. Okay. Rug,

821
02:31:45,940 --> 02:31:52,459
get this thing, wherever this goes. How about over here? Just give me my money. And then I'm

822
02:31:52,459 --> 02:32:06,280
buying a huge house. Slime guy. Yeah. You don't know the name of the, you don't know the name yet.

823
02:32:09,479 --> 02:32:11,799
You don't even know if that's even the name of the person. You don't even know if the

824
02:32:11,799 --> 02:32:21,829
person's name is Mr. Slime. You think I'm going to tell you that right now? Painting gray

825
02:32:21,829 --> 02:32:46,540
derangement. Booger boy. No, you have no idea. Nope. Dr. Jerma and Mr. Slime. Okay. Wall tiles.

826
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:55,219
We need light gray. I'm almost done. I do want to see the Simpsons house though. I really do

827
02:32:55,219 --> 02:33:05,379
want to just take a look at it. If we guess right, will you tell us if we are right?

828
02:33:07,209 --> 02:33:13,059
Um, I think you'll know. I don't know very many other people that are currently

829
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:24,760
streaming as a slime character on Twitch. Although I mean, I may have just like started

830
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:36,629
one of your careers. Like, Oh, I got to get on this right now. Slime, slime, slime, slime, slime,

831
02:33:36,629 --> 02:33:39,430
avatar, slime, avatar, start it. And now they're going to be, people are going to be looking for

832
02:33:43,079 --> 02:33:52,010
wait, Otto's bed. Wait, but how am I supposed to put this anywhere?

833
02:33:52,010 --> 02:33:54,569
Now you'll know the real one. You'll know the real slime.

834
02:34:01,879 --> 02:34:09,799
Good. I hope there are fucking imitators. You'll find the real slime guy.

835
02:34:09,799 --> 02:34:12,780
Cause ain't nobody else can do this.

836
02:34:28,950 --> 02:34:32,389
You don't know anybody in your whole life that can do that. I'm the only one.

837
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:40,649
So God find the one that's doing the fake one. That's like, not even fucking close.

838
02:34:40,649 --> 02:34:59,000
You're not even close. Oh, floor panels too. Five out of 15. Don't ever do that again.

839
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:04,200
I have no idea what that sounded like. Let me hear it. Blink me it. I'd like to hear it.

840
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:14,520
This guy sucks. Get your own show. This is my show. I'm on it right now, man. What do you mean

841
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:18,760
the go get your own show? This is, I'm on German. I'm not going to get kicked off my own channel by

842
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:31,030
Mr. Slime booger boy. Hold on. I want to hear this. This is important. Mr. Slime call sign.

843
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:36,170
You'll find the real slime guy. Cause ain't nobody else can do this.

844
02:35:52,139 --> 02:35:57,100
Why is it so robotic? It wasn't supposed to be like that. That just sounded like you had

845
02:35:57,819 --> 02:36:01,739
part of your headphones were out a little bit and you didn't plug them all the way in

846
02:36:01,739 --> 02:36:11,059
before you opened up an audio file. They're going to have to work on that.

847
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:29,020
It'll be a completely original voice. Okay. Floor panel. Palisander. No, what? Palisander.

848
02:36:29,739 --> 02:36:53,459
Man of five voices. Nah, I see that joke a lot. Come on. I can do a lot. I can do a lot.

849
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:59,459
Come on, Gwen. You know that. You know that. I'm not a man of three voices. I'm a man of like

850
02:36:59,459 --> 02:37:15,540
seven. That's a lot. Most people can only do one. They're on. I actually kind of like that floor.

851
02:37:15,540 --> 02:37:33,270
Wait, there was a whole nother room. What was that? Was that the, did you open up the wrong

852
02:37:33,270 --> 02:37:40,569
file on the computer? Where was that? Is that where we put all the trash? It was the garage.

853
02:37:40,569 --> 02:38:05,559
Yeah. Whatever. That was the basement. Okay. Here we go. I want to buy my own house. All right.

854
02:38:05,559 --> 02:38:26,329
Let's buy. I would buy my own house browser or purchase. I was on the moon. All right. HGTV.

855
02:38:26,889 --> 02:38:32,360
I want to get one of the HGTV house. What's this one? Accountants house.

856
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:44,229
Oh, this is 169,000. How big is this one? One story house from the eighties. Not big enough.

857
02:38:44,229 --> 02:38:54,950
Buy the moon. I don't have enough money to buy the moon. Moon, moon, moon, moon. I don't have

858
02:38:54,950 --> 02:39:05,079
enough money. Amberlee house. A beautiful house for sale. Three bathrooms and a pool. Only serious

859
02:39:05,079 --> 02:39:16,790
offers. I think we can make something out of this one. What are the ones that I own? Sell the houses.

860
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:46,489
Oh, okay. I own this one. I own this one too. What is this one? Sell this one for the moon house.

861
02:39:46,489 --> 02:39:57,670
This looks pretty good. Whose house is this? I didn't even do anything with this place.

862
02:39:57,670 --> 02:40:16,489
Is this the wall dad house? No, this is definitely not a wall dad. All right. Let's sell it. Submit

863
02:40:16,489 --> 02:40:28,790
garden. Put the house on auction. Go to the garden competition. This is an American garden.

864
02:40:28,790 --> 02:40:36,489
A lot of plants. The value of the house has increased by zero. Oh, whatever. Put it on auction.

865
02:40:37,540 --> 02:40:44,260
Sixty seven thousand. Ninety two thousand. Ninety four thousand. It's good here. Ninety eight. Ninety

866
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:52,920
nine. Ninety eight. Okay. A hundred. We're over a hundred. A hundred and two thousand. All right,

867
02:40:52,920 --> 02:41:04,459
Dolan. Congratulations. Okay. You have no positive opinions on the house. You only have negative

868
02:41:04,459 --> 02:41:21,190
things to say about this. Let's negotiate. I want an extra, uh, I want an extra sixty. I want an

869
02:41:21,190 --> 02:41:42,139
extra five thousand seven hundred dollars. Okay. Well, fine. You can have it. Wait, it's doing

870
02:41:42,139 --> 02:41:49,979
before and afters here too? I've owned this house for a very long time. These pictures have taken a

871
02:41:49,979 --> 02:42:03,860
very long time away from each other. There are not any doors. So I have enough money for the, uh,

872
02:42:03,860 --> 02:42:09,530
the meme house, right? All right. Is the moon thing, is it going to be stupid or is it fun?

873
02:42:18,860 --> 02:42:25,450
I hate this house. I'll take it. I'm not selling this one. I'll sell the other one. Look at this

874
02:42:25,450 --> 02:42:31,030
place. I got double fountains. No, there's no way I'm going to sell this place. I love this place.

875
02:42:31,030 --> 02:42:51,979
Okay. Owned. Burned house. Family guy house. Family guy house. Slime house. I live in the

876
02:42:51,979 --> 02:43:01,319
family guy house. What happened in here? I didn't even do it. I didn't, okay. I didn't even attempt

877
02:43:01,319 --> 02:43:09,370
to clean anything. This is why always go look at your apartment before you sign any documents.

878
02:43:14,969 --> 02:43:22,459
Yeah, let's sell it. Submit it for a garden contest. It's a Japanese style garden.

879
02:43:23,909 --> 02:43:34,329
You've been just lying. I haven't sent it in. Okay. Put this on auction. Anything more than

880
02:43:35,209 --> 02:43:49,739
$25,000 to this place is a, you were losing way too much money. Same guy. He likes this place

881
02:43:49,739 --> 02:44:01,690
more than the other one. Nolan's buying it again. Your offer is too low. I can sell the house for

882
02:44:01,690 --> 02:44:13,110
$1 more. He refused it. That would have been so funny. There are no before and after pictures.

883
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:20,809
There are only just ugly pictures. All right. If you went on Zillow and you saw these as the

884
02:44:20,809 --> 02:44:33,020
photos for the place, would you do it? Would you move in? But no, but it was a reverse. So it

885
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:37,319
looked like that, but they didn't update the pictures after they renovated. They put like

886
02:44:37,319 --> 02:44:43,180
$80,000 into that place to make it nice. And they're using old photos. See? That's why they,

887
02:44:43,819 --> 02:44:55,930
I always say, don't judge a book by its cover. $192,000. This better not be a bad idea.

888
02:44:55,930 --> 02:45:04,790
This is all the money I have. I'm not selling the, Oh right. It is the family guy. Holy shit.

889
02:45:06,329 --> 02:45:14,360
Oh my God. It's the, it is. It's like, architecturally, it's the house. It's the family

890
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:25,690
guy house. I thought it was just the outside. We knew this. No, no. I thought it was just like,

891
02:45:25,690 --> 02:45:30,250
Oh yeah. The yellow paint. It looked like the house. I forgot. I made the family guy house.

892
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:51,299
Okay. $492,000. Let's go buy it. Portfolio. Okay. Or purchase. House on the moon. This house allows

893
02:45:51,299 --> 02:45:55,540
residents to move away from the most earthly problems. Family who moves in here may have

894
02:45:55,540 --> 02:46:00,500
problems with communicating, commuting, but they unearth. Do I really buy this before any thoughts

895
02:46:00,500 --> 02:46:21,379
all the money I've made in the whole game? How do I make a cool house here? Like growing weed,

896
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:53,209
garden hose. Wait, why is this in the game? I can clean with this. I ran out of fuel. I have to buy

897
02:46:53,209 --> 02:47:15,100
a new one in the store. Are you shitting me? Which two garden hose? I don't have it. Emolition

898
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:32,620
triceps. Where's the garden hose? You didn't air blast. Okay. This house, this is, this is a waste

899
02:47:32,620 --> 02:47:36,389
of money. I'm going to clean it up and then put it on the auction. I'm going to try to make a million

900
02:47:36,389 --> 02:47:48,520
dollars. I don't like this house. It's just, no, I don't like this. Yeah. That's the plan. I don't

901
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:51,639
want this. I'm just going to sell it. I'm going to make like $800,000 and then we can buy the most

902
02:47:51,639 --> 02:48:03,819
expensive stuff in the world. This house is already ready. Flamethrower, mega low. I don't, I can't,

903
02:48:03,819 --> 02:48:08,979
I don't have enough. This is the most expensive house. Yeah. I'm about to make a lot of expensive

904
02:48:08,979 --> 02:48:29,350
profit from it too. Flip the moon house. Yeah. That's the idea. You're already ready. I just

905
02:48:29,350 --> 02:48:34,379
gotta clean it up a little. I don't need any new furniture or anything. They look, they get in a

906
02:48:34,379 --> 02:48:56,020
car. They get in a weed factory. They're getting a big security system. What's this for? Okay. All

907
02:48:56,020 --> 02:49:05,860
right. It's a little cleaned up. Is there an upstairs? This is just pissing into bottles.

908
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:18,420
What is this weird bed set up? Why is this in a mirror? That's odd, right? It's like an office.

909
02:49:19,989 --> 02:49:40,309
Two offices next to each other. There's no bathroom. If you walked over here and you

910
02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:46,809
just like got up on a cliff and just pissed into the air, what would happen? Would it slowly fall?

911
02:49:46,809 --> 02:49:57,350
Or would it just kind of go into outer space? What's the gravity like on the moon? It's like

912
02:49:57,350 --> 02:50:11,110
minus two, like minus like five percent earth, minus 10% or something. What is it hiding his

913
02:50:11,110 --> 02:50:28,870
like piss bottles? One sixth. That's kind of cool. All right. Cool. Cool. This is all expensive

914
02:50:28,870 --> 02:50:39,829
stuff. It's three fits. Look at all this stuff. What is this? I just sell everything in this whole

915
02:50:39,829 --> 02:50:54,090
house. How much is this worth? $180. Why not just sell everything and then sell the moon? You could

916
02:50:54,090 --> 02:50:58,649
do the garden thing. Yeah, I did the garden DLC like a year ago or so. It was a lot of fun.

917
02:50:58,649 --> 02:51:10,260
They're selling a car? All right. I'm going to sell the car first. What? Go to job. I thought I was

918
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:20,840
about to give this a full letter grade. That was close. Okay. I'm ready. Would I pay for it? $480?

919
02:51:20,840 --> 02:51:37,979
$482? Already made money. I feel like this guy's following me around. Starting to feel like it's

920
02:51:37,979 --> 02:51:58,309
the moon, man. I want an extra $2,000. There we go. Acceptable. I made $20,000. Now let's go do the

921
02:51:58,309 --> 02:52:06,170
real house. Shit. I'm burning time here. I'm burning time. It's been like three hours. It

922
02:52:06,170 --> 02:52:26,180
went by so quickly. No, not into the scream voice. I'm just saying it's been, I'm just kind of flew

923
02:52:26,180 --> 02:52:33,579
by. Morning maple. Thanks to the five community subs. I missed it a while ago. Thanks. I appreciate

924
02:52:33,579 --> 02:52:52,569
it. Okay. $510,000. Browser. Pink kingdom. Century old house. Accountants house. Uninhabited house.

925
02:52:53,049 --> 02:53:07,590
A man cave. A family house. Or Samarta Myers house. Uninhabited house.

926
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:12,020
This house was bought for refurbishment. The current owner did not have time to do it. You're

927
02:53:12,020 --> 02:53:20,040
looking for a buyer. Price is final. It's not negotiable. Beautiful big house in the back country

928
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:25,399
for sale. A lucky strike for people who have value silence. Decent one to take a rest from the city

929
02:53:25,399 --> 02:53:29,620
noise and other people's company. Only you, your house, and the nature around you. This place was

930
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:46,420
abandoned many years ago. This place is huge. $254,000,000? It's this one. Family house. This

931
02:53:46,420 --> 02:53:55,899
one looks like it has more rooms. Why is it? What's with the, uh, the radiation thing? Does that mean

932
02:53:55,899 --> 02:54:21,399
it's like something bad? All right. Which one? Um, man cave or the like nuclear house? Well,

933
02:54:21,399 --> 02:54:29,000
I'm seeing a lot of both. Slime house. All right. I'm going to take a, I'm going to go piss. I'll

934
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:35,000
give you a, a straw pole right back. I'm going to refill the water I have here too. I'm going to

935
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:51,450
get up and stretch a little bit as well. So here is a straw pole. I'm going to say nuclear or

936
02:54:52,700 --> 02:57:51,239
man cave. Okay. I will be right back. Okay. Post the slime guy.

937
02:57:51,399 --> 02:58:01,049
No, that will defeat the purpose. Uh, it looks like, uh, nuclear is, is just, is won by a long

938
02:58:01,049 --> 02:58:08,809
shot. Thank you for voting. Okay. A big, beautiful house in the back country. Let's go there now.

939
02:58:09,610 --> 02:58:36,389
Make it green. Everything. You would go nuts in that house. You would go fucking nuts. Uh,

940
02:58:36,389 --> 02:58:47,209
it's the Halloween house. It's the Halloween house. I get it. Okay. Sure. Well, here's the

941
02:58:47,209 --> 02:58:52,760
thing about this game. Um, that's just a scary person in the house. This is a game where I flip

942
02:58:52,760 --> 02:59:02,100
houses and buy property and stuff. This is not in any particular universe. There's somebody in this

943
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:08,579
house. Run, get out now. It has to be the Mr. Slime's Halloween house. Okay. I'm going to go

944
02:59:08,579 --> 02:59:51,239
to the house. I don't want to look at that for this TV too. I don't want any of this shit.

945
02:59:53,219 --> 02:59:56,579
No, fuck that. I'm not making a Halloween house. I don't care how haunted this place

946
02:59:56,579 --> 03:00:03,610
is. It's going to be a nice family place. Yeah. I don't care. You think I'm going to let that get

947
03:00:03,610 --> 03:00:15,930
to me? You think I'm going to give in to that? Nope. It could be screaming faces in the bedrooms.

948
03:00:15,930 --> 03:00:36,409
It doesn't matter there. Oh, I just saw the lights, but I have to spray the house. Good thing. I

949
03:00:36,409 --> 03:00:42,409
don't have any neighbors because I'm a fucking wacko. It's like three o'clock in the morning.

950
03:00:42,409 --> 03:00:52,010
Get rid of this too. It's like a bloody gnome. It moved. Yeah. I don't want that.

951
03:00:52,729 --> 03:01:17,590
This is not a Halloween house. Get the hell out of there. That's Freddy Fazbear's house. Oh, no.

952
03:01:18,389 --> 03:01:31,899
Weeds there. Can I get this place to light up? Or is this actually the haunted house

953
03:01:31,899 --> 03:01:45,610
moment? I'm not going to ever have it to be daytime. You're a terrible window cleaner.

954
03:01:45,610 --> 03:01:57,270
Pretty good at picking up weeds by the lights. I mean, I'm going to light this place up.

955
03:01:57,909 --> 03:02:06,709
You're going to be able to see this house from space. I don't like this being in the dark shit.

956
03:02:14,250 --> 03:02:21,739
A non-descript civilian. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Appreciate it. Thanks for the subs.

957
03:02:22,459 --> 03:02:39,540
Place is almost pretty clean, at least on the outside. Look across the street. What's across

958
03:02:39,540 --> 03:03:06,520
the street? Any slimers in chat? Slimers. Okay. What if I just did like a, a, a, a walk,

959
03:03:06,520 --> 03:03:10,440
like that German walk thing that you guys are always put down, but as the slime.

960
03:03:12,170 --> 03:03:14,969
Any joke I tell, this is where it's going to be really interesting.

961
03:03:15,610 --> 03:03:19,770
Because any joke I tell on the slime stream, I'm going to tell it on my stream too.

962
03:03:20,760 --> 03:03:37,829
We'll see who's funnier. I'm going to battle myself. He's going to just repeat jokes.

963
03:03:38,549 --> 03:04:06,069
This is going to be great. I pick up these weeds, make Twitch drama with myself. Yeah.

964
03:04:06,069 --> 03:04:17,850
Get that box out of here. Okay. Well, the lights, that's always very scary.

965
03:04:18,569 --> 03:04:28,260
This is going to be a little ring girl here. Why am I doing this house? I,

966
03:04:28,260 --> 03:04:36,920
I don't want to be doing this. I want to do the HGTV stuff, not a Halloween. What's that sound?

967
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:57,799
There's a leak somewhere. I don't see it. It's a ghost peeing. Well, he's gone for a pretty long

968
03:04:57,799 --> 03:05:07,399
time. I know what that feels like, man. It's just you. You're peeing your pants. You're going to

969
03:05:07,479 --> 03:05:31,610
pee his pants. So gross. I would not want to hold this vacuum. It's disgusting. Clean this.

970
03:05:34,729 --> 03:05:48,680
The lights work. I'm putting more lights. I want way more lights. Why am I doing the Halloween map?

971
03:05:53,420 --> 03:06:12,969
He's dirty. Dirt. All right. Dirt. We're good. House is clean. Look in the closet. I can't.

972
03:06:12,969 --> 03:06:26,100
I can't look in the closet. Okay. So what do I want to do with this place?

973
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:31,909
We're going to, with the whole, we're going to take, we're going to take care of this top floor.

974
03:06:31,909 --> 03:06:56,389
I want, let's get rid of this. Check the basement. Ghosts don't like that. No,

975
03:06:56,389 --> 03:07:03,780
this is not going to be a ghost house. I'm going to, in fact, let's do this now. I want lights,

976
03:07:03,780 --> 03:07:15,590
lamps, lighting. Ghosts are afraid of light. Let's get the brightest shit we can get

977
03:07:15,590 --> 03:07:20,579
just for now. This is temporary. Okay. Here we go. Just fluorescent.

978
03:07:20,579 --> 03:07:31,500
There's a big ass fluorescent light. Yeah. Have fun scaring me now. It's going to be very scary.

979
03:07:31,500 --> 03:07:46,729
All right. Turn the light, turn the lamp on. Look at that. All the lights flicker, don't they?

980
03:07:46,729 --> 03:07:53,639
The lights flicker. I can't do this one. I can't. The lights are going to flicker all the time.

981
03:07:54,280 --> 03:07:58,440
All right. Where's the boss that I have to like smash his head in with the mallet in the basement?

982
03:07:58,440 --> 03:08:24,100
Where is it? Is that, is it like a doll? I keep hearing doors open. Okay. This is it. Here we go.

983
03:08:24,819 --> 03:08:47,290
The FOV just went to like 300. It's gas. It's gas. It's not a monster at all. It's gas.

984
03:08:47,290 --> 03:09:08,040
That's what that sound is. Is there anything I can do? I'm selling this house. I don't even

985
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:31,959
want to do this. I want to do a different house. I don't like this one. Bunny moved. Whoa.

986
03:09:34,280 --> 03:09:40,920
Dolan gets outbid for the first time. Look in the backyard. Wait, wait, what, what, what?

987
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:48,500
Refuse offer. Did we find $6,700? But whatever. That's not, that's nothing. I'm fucking, I got

988
03:09:48,500 --> 03:09:57,620
like $300,000. That's fine. Where do you want to go? You didn't get rid of the curse. That's not

989
03:09:57,620 --> 03:10:23,430
part of the deal. Look in the backyard. Who's in here? Bury it. Burying the coffin will probably

990
03:10:23,430 --> 03:10:42,229
break the curse on this house. Wait, what? Oh, nice. Whoa. All right. Cool. I got a house now.

991
03:10:42,229 --> 03:10:52,280
This is a huge basement down here. Oh my God. You know what's going down here. All right. Let's

992
03:10:52,280 --> 03:11:19,260
clean this place up. This is like $4 million. I don't want any scary stuff. Hey, basement. This

993
03:11:19,260 --> 03:11:33,690
wall, the basement wall is terrible. It has no taste. Well, hold on a second here. Not wanting

994
03:11:33,690 --> 03:11:41,319
Saturn devours his children on my wall is, I mean, that's like a, that's like a family den.

995
03:11:41,319 --> 03:11:57,879
That's where we're going to go play like Scrabble together. I don't want like, I don't, I don't,

996
03:11:57,879 --> 03:12:06,389
I don't want to look at it. Basement Scrabble. What's wrong with basement Scrabble? Why does

997
03:12:06,389 --> 03:12:16,549
this keep changing? There's a lot of fucked up rooms in this house. All right. Get rid of this.

998
03:12:16,549 --> 03:12:46,899
Stream the Scrabble game. No, not everything has to be streamed. I delete this stuff. Get rid of

999
03:12:46,899 --> 03:12:53,190
this door. What do I want to do? All right. What did I say? I was going to make a man cave.

1000
03:12:53,190 --> 03:13:10,739
I'm going to think of what to do up here. Make a man cave. Make a whole house man cave. No,

1001
03:13:10,739 --> 03:13:22,489
that's not what I was going to do. There's going to be a slime house. The door frame with the hammer.

1002
03:13:22,489 --> 03:13:38,739
All green, all green. Make a smaller house inside of this house. We got to get a clean slate and

1003
03:13:38,739 --> 03:13:47,899
then I'll figure it out. Make a casino. It needs to be a clear upstairs. Clear. I need to, I need

1004
03:13:47,899 --> 03:14:01,459
time to think. Make a casino. I don't think I can even make a casino. I'll try. Your house is a

1005
03:14:01,459 --> 03:14:21,750
casino. Make it a hotel. Casino hotel. Make the actual house ridiculously smaller than the house.

1006
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:27,450
Okay, wait. I kind of like that idea. I like that idea. I like that idea. I want to do that.

1007
03:14:27,450 --> 03:14:31,559
Okay. That's what I want to do first. The first thing I want to do is have there be,

1008
03:14:32,440 --> 03:14:47,739
can I even break this all down? I don't think I can do that. Get rid of this fucking thing.

1009
03:14:47,819 --> 03:14:57,049
This is the door. Where's the front door? Here's the front door and you're forced to go up the

1010
03:14:57,049 --> 03:15:02,520
stairs. This is going to be walled off. There's not going to be anything here. Forced to go up the

1011
03:15:02,520 --> 03:15:12,440
stairs and then this door here on the left is not going to be here. This is going to be just a bed

1012
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:42,250
and a toilet like here. Make it a labyrinth. Rip frames. No kitchen. Now we'll make a kitchen.

1013
03:15:42,250 --> 03:15:53,399
It'll work. I'm going to put like, I'm going to say, okay, it's going to be like an electromagnetic

1014
03:15:53,399 --> 03:15:58,659
house all around the outside before I build the inside. It's going to be a bunch of like,

1015
03:15:58,659 --> 03:16:10,680
a bunch of like anti like 5G rays and stuff and like tin foil and stuff. I'm going to be

1016
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:31,799
completely protected on the inside. I'm going to make the walls out of like steel bunker house.

1017
03:16:31,799 --> 03:16:58,709
It's going to be a DMT house, 5G broadcasting station, a cell tower. Just make it a cell tower.

1018
03:16:58,709 --> 03:17:17,350
Okay. Looking, getting there, getting there. Get rid of all this shit. That's not where I want it

1019
03:17:17,350 --> 03:17:41,979
to be. This is all junk. We don't need it right now. This is a great link. I think I've, I think

1020
03:17:41,979 --> 03:18:35,510
we've seen this before. Put that in the house. So big. This is huge photo. Fit to screen. Squished.

1021
03:18:35,510 --> 03:18:50,299
Put that on. All right. Maybe. No, I don't want that. I cannot fucking believe I'm about to do the,

1022
03:18:51,299 --> 03:18:59,819
just make a small house in the house. I, why am I doing this? This is not, I, this is stupid.

1023
03:19:11,690 --> 03:19:13,530
Make a big house in a small house.

1024
03:19:18,329 --> 03:19:27,340
No, it'll, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. I kind of like the idea of having a hotel. I don't know.

1025
03:19:27,340 --> 03:19:40,790
I don't know yet. I don't know yet. I need to see, I got to get a clean slate or like a big theater

1026
03:19:40,790 --> 03:20:03,479
with a bunch of chairs and I like a performance stage. Like the, I, the entire theater staff are

1027
03:20:03,479 --> 03:20:12,979
asking for a raise. No, I mean, just like the whole, the house is a movie theater. The actual

1028
03:20:12,979 --> 03:20:31,989
house is a movie theater. Wait, I already made a movie theater? When did I make a movie theater in

1029
03:20:31,989 --> 03:20:44,979
Hubslipper? Did I? I made a movie theater? No, I didn't. I made a bowling alley. I made a mall with

1030
03:20:44,979 --> 03:20:56,409
a bowling alley in it. I didn't make a movie theater. It's the same thing. No, just because

1031
03:20:56,409 --> 03:21:00,329
some bowling alleys are in movie theaters and some movie theaters are in bowling alleys doesn't mean

1032
03:21:00,329 --> 03:21:12,200
that they're the same thing. Okay. So this is the upstairs. This is the space that we have to work

1033
03:21:12,200 --> 03:21:32,899
with down here. All this space out here. We're taking on everything. I need to be able to see

1034
03:21:32,899 --> 03:21:42,840
everything. And it's the basement, right? The basement too. Okay. Hold on and make, make a

1035
03:21:42,840 --> 03:22:05,350
bowling alley and movie theater. Make it a prison. Making a maze is kind of funny and like you finally

1036
03:22:05,350 --> 03:22:30,219
get down here. Make a working society. Make it a maze where you have to go through the maze to get

1037
03:22:30,219 --> 03:22:47,899
to the bathroom. This is such a pain in the ass. Unscrew. Oh wait. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want this

1038
03:22:47,899 --> 03:23:09,739
to be bathroom. Okay. Cool. I like, don't mind this yet. The house is going to be green. It's a secret

1039
03:23:09,739 --> 03:23:18,409
basement wall. Hey, I'm shitting myself. Where do I go? Well, I would just stay put that you can

1040
03:23:18,409 --> 03:23:21,989
really figure out what the hell you're going to do with yourself. Running around and sprinting

1041
03:23:21,989 --> 03:23:25,430
and screaming and oh my God, oh my God. That's not going to help you. That's going to make everything

1042
03:23:25,430 --> 03:23:48,440
worse. Cool. Just make the whole house a solid wall. So I'll open it up so I can get a good look.

1043
03:23:48,440 --> 03:23:57,340
All right. We got a good look. Basement goes down here and so does that. The basement cannot be

1044
03:23:57,340 --> 03:24:10,629
destroyed. It's a brick house. I'll fix it. Make a normal house. You know, that is what an interesting

1045
03:24:10,629 --> 03:24:19,459
concept. Jeremy, why don't you just make a house and make it like look good and really show us like

1046
03:24:19,459 --> 03:24:43,020
what you would do when you designed the house. I mean, should I ban that guy because make a normal

1047
03:24:43,020 --> 03:24:53,690
house? I don't think I even could. All right. Demolition is done. I got 250 grand. I'm good.

1048
03:24:53,690 --> 03:25:20,709
Plenty of money. I'll wait outside. Shit. I have to do this too. Damn it. Dig up the coffin.

1049
03:25:21,590 --> 03:25:31,750
I don't even know where the coffin was. All right. We look at the entrances. We've got

1050
03:25:33,700 --> 03:25:44,340
these lamps that I don't like. Okay. Front door. That's what it looks like on the outside. You walk

1051
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:55,299
in. You can go right. You can go left and down. This is important because, all right, here's what

1052
03:25:55,299 --> 03:26:25,430
we're going to do. Okay. We're going to seal this off. Okay. You can put one there. We're going to

1053
03:26:25,430 --> 03:26:35,620
seal that off. We're going to seal this off too. And then I'm going to make an entire elaborate

1054
03:26:35,620 --> 03:26:51,979
like not just try to leave. If I'm going to make a maze, I need to make it hard. Is it okay? Is there

1055
03:26:51,979 --> 03:27:03,739
a way that I can make the maze go down here and end up back up the stairs? Okay. I think so. Wait,

1056
03:27:03,739 --> 03:27:19,159
I think there is. Oh yeah. I can do that. Are you kidding me? Because then I can go like this. No,

1057
03:27:19,159 --> 03:27:39,850
I can't because I can't split this down the middle. Shit. All right. I need a second staircase.

1058
03:27:41,209 --> 03:27:46,790
You can't put a staircase. You can't remove and you cannot put new staircases in, unfortunately.

1059
03:27:46,790 --> 03:27:59,639
So I need to do something with this. I think this is where the illegal casino is. All right.

1060
03:27:59,639 --> 03:28:19,049
That makes complete sense. Start down here. Uh, more muscle store. We need to have a really,

1061
03:28:19,049 --> 03:28:37,770
really crazy floor. Bathrooms. Should there be a bathroom down here? Molding bag. Let's go.

1062
03:28:38,569 --> 03:28:52,100
Okay. Furniture. I don't need some like bar tables. See a good one. Where's a good like,

1063
03:28:52,100 --> 03:28:56,500
no, these are good like poker tables or a blackjack table. We need like a big circle.

1064
03:28:56,500 --> 03:29:13,750
How big are these? Well, they're enormous. Shelf? No. Leather. Let's do,

1065
03:29:14,870 --> 03:29:25,209
let's just see how big they are. I mean, they're fucking huge. There's only one game down here.

1066
03:29:32,280 --> 03:29:42,940
One huge game of blackjack. That's so big. It's like 15 people can play. No, no, no, no, no.

1067
03:29:42,940 --> 03:29:56,469
It's got to be smaller. Table, table, table. We need table. Table. Ella. Table. Mooner. There we go.

1068
03:29:56,469 --> 03:30:19,979
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. There we go. Okay. So this is like the blackjack and shit.

1069
03:30:19,979 --> 03:30:30,780
Slots are going to be in here. See what could be a slot? I need chairs and slots. Lamps. There's

1070
03:30:30,780 --> 03:30:45,579
got to be a weird fucked up lamp. That's, that's not bad. Can that be on the ground?

1071
03:30:45,579 --> 03:30:51,299
Wall lights. Put mirrors on the walls. Make a fun house.

1072
03:30:57,479 --> 03:31:17,139
Why did you pick the poop colored table? I don't know. Make a fun house. Mirror. Oh shit.

1073
03:31:17,219 --> 03:31:36,729
No, this is going to be fucked up. Make a mirror maze. Make a mirror maze. It's going to be

1074
03:31:36,729 --> 03:31:50,090
impossible to find my way out. This is going to be so trippy. It's not even, this is going to suck.

1075
03:31:50,090 --> 03:32:14,250
This kind of looks good. It does kind of look good. Weirdly enough. How quickly would you go

1076
03:32:14,250 --> 03:32:20,729
crazy if all your walls are mirrors? He's a vampire. But I thought vampires weren't supposed

1077
03:32:20,729 --> 03:32:34,170
to be able to see the reflection. Oh yes. Yes. This shit's going to take forever. This is going

1078
03:32:45,670 --> 03:32:57,479
to take forever. This is where I'm, okay. This is where I just come to meditate. You look like

1079
03:32:57,479 --> 03:33:29,719
you're playing a Wolfenstein level. I got plenty of money, right? You, what do you mean stop you?

1080
03:33:29,719 --> 03:33:39,180
I didn't, what do you mean ruin? I didn't ruin anything. Stop, stop, stop. Uneven. Fix it.

1081
03:33:39,180 --> 03:34:12,940
This is just a first draft. There. I got it. I fixed it. I fixed it. Are there any bigger

1082
03:34:12,940 --> 03:34:18,229
fucking mirrors? Seriously, are there bigger mirrors? This is going to take, this is horrible.

1083
03:34:18,229 --> 03:34:26,200
This is just like a solar paneled basement, which makes no sense. You come in with a flashlight

1084
03:34:26,200 --> 03:34:34,100
and shine it at him? What are you doing? You're just that guy that's super into solar. Yeah,

1085
03:34:34,100 --> 03:34:39,139
you know I got solar. I got solar literally everywhere. I got into my fucking bathroom

1086
03:34:39,139 --> 03:34:48,469
and powers my teeth brushes, my toilets, my lights. I don't even have a roof anymore. I

1087
03:34:48,469 --> 03:35:06,100
took the roof off and the sun just shines on all these panels. We're getting there. This is,

1088
03:35:06,100 --> 03:35:20,139
this is like room you pay to get into. This is like a fun room, right? This is the anti-5G room.

1089
03:35:20,139 --> 03:35:31,270
This is the 5G room. This is one of those rooms where you go in and you just shine a single like

1090
03:35:31,270 --> 03:35:38,790
laser pointer at the wall and he'd probably kill you. You know, it was just going to ricochet off

1091
03:35:38,790 --> 03:36:18,579
like 500 mirrors. He's going to kill you. Nice totally spies logic. That's so funny. Okay, when

1092
03:36:18,579 --> 03:36:24,059
I'm not going to do the whole house like this, that would be so painful to me. It would, I would,

1093
03:36:24,059 --> 03:36:37,159
it would cause me physical pain, I think. I can't do the whole house. Look at how good it looks.

1094
03:36:37,159 --> 03:36:53,639
That's not going to look good upstairs. Get the bigger mirror. Okay, this is the mirror house.

1095
03:36:53,639 --> 03:36:57,100
This is the mirror house. Mirror house. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hot, hot, hot, hot,

1096
03:36:57,100 --> 03:37:20,739
hot, hot, hot. I want the mirror. I want the bed I sleep on to be a mirror. Big. Somebody said

1097
03:37:20,739 --> 03:37:37,139
there's a big mirror. I think that's the biggest mirror you can get. Mirror module? No, it's as big

1098
03:37:37,139 --> 03:37:52,329
as it gets. There's no large or anything. Wait. Mirror Lamont. Mirror module. No, I can't. This is

1099
03:37:52,329 --> 03:38:16,649
as big as I can make it. There's more? All mirrors. No, there's no. I mean, here's mirror. This is not,

1100
03:38:16,649 --> 03:38:28,709
this is not even that much bigger. On the left, on the left. Hold on. I'm getting spammed. Mr.

1101
03:38:29,430 --> 03:38:33,850
Slime's playing. Yeah. No, that's not what it's going to look like. It's not what it's going to

1102
03:38:33,850 --> 03:38:54,010
look like. Not what it's going to look like, guys. Sorry. There's a mirror category. Where's the

1103
03:38:54,010 --> 03:39:18,309
mirror category? Old-fashioned mirror. Mirror. Mirror. I don't think this is bigger. I don't say

1104
03:39:18,309 --> 03:39:42,170
mirror. I don't think it's big enough. Well, I'm going to keep going with what I was doing.

1105
03:39:42,170 --> 03:39:46,100
I hate this. I'm only doing one room like this. I'm never going to open it. I don't even care

1106
03:39:46,100 --> 03:40:12,780
what's in here. I'm only finishing this room because I have to. Sort by size. Uh, sort by size.

1107
03:40:12,780 --> 03:40:18,780
Sort by oldest. Descending. Alphabetical. Price. You can't sort by size. What are you? What's

1108
03:40:18,780 --> 03:40:31,860
this? Jebait. Okay. I'm done with this shit. I'm just going to put a bunch of weird lights

1109
03:40:31,860 --> 03:40:46,649
so the ricochets off and I have to dodge the laser. I also kind of feel like this is going

1110
03:40:46,649 --> 03:40:53,270
to break the game. If I turn a light on in here, I think that's the game's going to probably crash.

1111
03:40:53,270 --> 03:41:24,409
Mirror modules connect. Oh no. No. No, no, no, no. No. I can't do. The whole house is a mirror.

1112
03:41:24,409 --> 03:41:29,129
We're going to be here for so long. You know how long that's going to take? It's going to be like

1113
03:41:29,129 --> 03:41:37,420
a portal gun house. Oh shit! Okay. All right. I'm sorry everybody that's not going to want this to

1114
03:41:37,420 --> 03:41:50,040
happen. I'm sorry everybody! I'm sorry. Even the outside is going to be a mirror. I'm going to get

1115
03:41:50,040 --> 03:42:18,059
lost. Oh Jesus. This is bad. Oh no. Should I put obstacles in the way? I wish I could control Z.

1116
03:42:18,059 --> 03:42:39,459
I'm not going to run out of money, right? This is one of those absurd custom houses that you will

1117
03:42:39,459 --> 03:42:52,600
never sell. Ever. You're going to have to demolish this house. Oh HGTV presents interesting houses.

1118
03:42:52,600 --> 03:43:03,940
Better be your permanent residence. Yeah, you know, we decided on having full of mirrors just

1119
03:43:03,940 --> 03:43:13,209
so I can kind of see everything. Always make sure like nothing was wrong in the house. Why is it

1120
03:43:13,209 --> 03:43:25,750
Kermit? Man, I got, I got 10 voices. I really got like a lot of inspiration from insects. You know,

1121
03:43:25,750 --> 03:43:36,309
they have like a hundred eyes. Kind of mimic that in my real life. I mean, I get a little nauseous.

1122
03:43:36,309 --> 03:43:53,180
I get a little nauseous, but it's worth it. Peeing is hard though. I can't tell if the toilet I'm

1123
03:43:53,180 --> 03:44:02,069
peeing into is the real one or one of the mirrors. Hard to pee. But what I did is I just turned the

1124
03:44:02,069 --> 03:44:13,270
whole bottom into a urinal. This bathtub works pretty well. Nine more voices to go. That's right.

1125
03:44:13,270 --> 03:44:39,180
I'm going to have to paint that gray. If you stood in the middle. Okay. If you put like a light in

1126
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:45,159
the middle of this room, I really wouldn't be afraid. I would get electrocuted. You can move

1127
03:44:45,159 --> 03:45:02,010
it to the left. No, look, I can't see. I can't, can't do it. Question is, can I do this instead?

1128
03:45:02,010 --> 03:45:21,100
Yup. Yup. It can be fixed. Hey, at least I'll be able to stand anywhere in my house while the main

1129
03:45:21,100 --> 03:45:45,860
character comes in and I get to go. That's cool. I get to do that. I lost. No, I can't do it. This

1130
03:45:45,860 --> 03:46:14,709
is already freaking me out. We're not even like a 10th of the way there, but what happens if the

1131
03:46:14,709 --> 03:46:43,180
guys, guys, I'm in trouble. Oh, I don't like this. This hurts. I don't like this. Your house is going

1132
03:46:43,180 --> 03:46:58,090
to be invisible. These need to be lower. I can't even fit these here. Uh, yes, I can actually.

1133
03:46:58,950 --> 03:47:04,329
Excuse me. What are you talking about? What do you mean you can't fit it there?

1134
03:47:04,889 --> 03:47:21,610
I can't fit it here. Shit. Remove the window. You can't remove windows. It's impossible. Break

1135
03:47:21,610 --> 03:47:31,209
the top first. I can't. Cause this is a, this is part of the structure. All right. What like weird

1136
03:47:31,209 --> 03:48:01,850
cartoon doors can I have? Pretty mirror-esque. That's pretty much a mirror. Make a mini-golf.

1137
03:48:01,850 --> 03:48:20,280
I'll do the outside. All right. Can I make a normal house? Like did I, can I make a normal house?

1138
03:48:23,139 --> 03:48:38,579
When can I make a normal house? Like, like, should I, can I do that? Oh Jesus. Okay. I'm just going

1139
03:48:38,579 --> 03:48:43,459
to get this done. I'm going to get this done. Get it done. Get it done. Get it done. Get it done.

1140
03:48:43,459 --> 03:49:09,000
Get to work. Um, what do you think I'm doing? The mirror thing was your idea. It was? No,

1141
03:49:09,000 --> 03:49:19,100
it wasn't. Was it? No. Somebody else said, Hey dude, put mirrors everywhere. Come on. Stop it.

1142
03:49:19,100 --> 03:49:32,020
It was you. All right. Hold on. Hold on. We're going. We're going. We're going. We're going.

1143
03:49:32,020 --> 03:49:43,110
We're going. We're going. I can't put them there. When I actually stand in the middle of this room,

1144
03:49:43,829 --> 03:49:48,870
somebody's actually going to puke. I need to make a really, really fair warning.

1145
03:49:48,870 --> 03:49:54,020
Here's your warning now. When I stand in the middle of the room, when this is done

1146
03:49:54,020 --> 03:50:00,120
and there is furniture and lights in here, one of you is going to throw up. I just want to make

1147
03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:28,379
sure that you know that now. I can go faster than this shit. Come on. Think on the bright side.

1148
03:50:28,379 --> 03:50:36,059
You're going to be immortalized as the genius streamer who created the mirror house.

1149
03:50:36,059 --> 03:50:50,149
Um, you probably should put mirror in quotes. It's misaligned. It's never going to be aligned

1150
03:50:50,149 --> 03:51:01,559
right. I'm going to paint it the same color. Don't worry. Security system.

1151
03:51:02,280 --> 03:51:19,879
Fuck it. Don't need it. I don't need lights yet. Oh, oh, I already hate it. Oh, I hate it.

1152
03:51:19,879 --> 03:51:24,090
It's not even done. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like

1153
03:51:24,090 --> 03:51:32,729
it. I really don't. I don't like it. Something in my body just wanted to just recoil backwards

1154
03:51:32,729 --> 03:51:42,180
and scream. This is a good idea because the burglar can't find your shit now. I mean, that's

1155
03:51:42,180 --> 03:51:54,420
yeah. You got that right. That makes sense. But, um, have fun stubbing your toe on every single

1156
03:51:54,420 --> 03:52:00,540
thing in your house. And I don't mean just like stubbing your toe once. I mean every single item.

1157
03:52:00,540 --> 03:52:05,559
You're going to constantly be in a state of just, just disarray. You're going to bump into the

1158
03:52:05,559 --> 03:52:09,399
couch. You're going to hit your head on the fucking ceiling lights and shit. Is it going to be bad?

1159
03:52:09,399 --> 03:52:25,219
I don't think I could, I don't think you could pay me enough money to live in this house. This

1160
03:52:25,219 --> 03:52:54,440
would start to really, really get to me in a week. Remember the music's driving me insane.

1161
03:52:54,840 --> 03:53:08,620
What should I put on instead? Ceiling mirrors? Uh, you can't do ceiling mirrors. See the only

1162
03:53:08,620 --> 03:53:17,299
thing that we have to escape is to stare at the ground or stare at the ceiling. Can't fit them

1163
03:53:17,299 --> 03:53:47,340
here. Why not? What? Bullshit. Put on Luigi's Mansion? That's not a bad idea. Oh God. I'd

1164
03:53:47,340 --> 03:54:02,700
prefer it to be like this. Is that real? Is which one's real? All right. Yeah. This is horror music.

1165
03:54:02,700 --> 03:54:14,260
I'll turn the horror music off. There we go. Horror music off and Luigi's Mansion OST.

1166
03:54:14,260 --> 03:55:02,979
I remember that sound. Okay. That's not bad for a second. I thought, wait, if I do mirrors here

1167
03:55:02,979 --> 03:55:26,500
too, right, is it going to work the way that I think it is? This is not even lined up. Is the

1168
03:55:26,500 --> 03:55:58,059
OST really the opening cut scene? Let's be honest. I just scared the shit out of me. Hello. Here it

1169
03:55:58,059 --> 03:56:35,079
comes. Right. This is the song, right? This doesn't look right. Why does it look so off? Oh, okay. Um,

1170
03:56:35,079 --> 03:56:54,360
okay. What is a hundred gecks? Like everyone can, I see that all the time. What's a hundred gecks?

1171
03:56:54,360 --> 03:57:26,120
Shit. It doesn't fit. I can't, what? I cannot believe I'm doing this, but it's, I can't back

1172
03:57:26,120 --> 03:57:44,620
out now. If I back out now that it's a failure, I can't back out. I have to do it. Oh, mom.

1173
03:57:46,379 --> 03:57:58,500
The game's having trouble rendering the actual, you know what it looks like? It just looks like

1174
03:57:58,500 --> 03:58:20,149
the game hasn't loaded all the assets in the house yet. It just looks blurry and fucked up.

1175
03:58:20,149 --> 03:58:26,139
Check settings to make better reflections. Well, one, hold on one step at a time. One step at a

1176
03:58:26,139 --> 03:58:45,719
time. We're almost, we're almost done with the first floor. It's already starting to have

1177
03:58:45,719 --> 03:58:59,610
problems. Okay. Let's do, all right. I can build a wall here. Wait, I can just do that over there

1178
03:58:59,610 --> 03:59:14,790
too. This house is going to give me mercury poisoning. Mercury house. We need just flat.

1179
03:59:14,790 --> 03:59:22,180
All right. I, this is where I really blew it. Okay. This is how I blew it. We just need one

1180
03:59:22,180 --> 03:59:33,239
full thing across. I fucked it all up by needing the, like, just like this, a straight line across.

1181
03:59:41,270 --> 03:59:55,000
Restart. I'll show you how you restart. You just pretend this wall doesn't exist behind me.

1182
03:59:55,000 --> 04:00:18,520
Hold R. Building distance is one meter more. Oh, cool. This reminds me of Earthbound. I get

1183
04:00:18,520 --> 04:00:49,049
Earthbound vibes from this. Let's go. I'm ready. Don't make mistakes. It takes longer. It takes

1184
04:00:49,049 --> 04:01:13,610
longer if you make a goddamn mistake. Just get it right. Fuck. Whatever. This is riveting gameplay

1185
04:01:13,610 --> 04:01:26,229
here. Like, holy shit. This is unbelievable. What did you do on your Wednesday afternoon?

1186
04:01:26,229 --> 04:01:36,100
Watched a crazy guy, uh, mirror every wall in his house. Uh, dude, just, um, like, you were ghosting

1187
04:01:36,100 --> 04:01:59,459
me. That you'd rather do that than, like, hang out with me? Yeah. All right. Yeah. Sorry, dude. And,

1188
04:01:59,459 --> 04:02:06,920
like, you know what, man? Lose my number. I just, I'm just gonna take this opportunity right now.

1189
04:02:06,920 --> 04:02:15,030
Like, we just don't, we don't, like, see eye to eye on anything. And you're kind of like a dick,

1190
04:02:15,030 --> 04:02:26,329
man. Like, I've just, I'll talk to you later. This is gonna make my house look way bigger.

1191
04:02:26,329 --> 04:02:35,559
No, it's not. This is just what the house looked like without the mirror wall. I'm giving myself

1192
04:02:35,559 --> 04:03:09,110
an illusion to a house that exists behind this wall. Why? Infinite house. Infinite housing.

1193
04:03:09,110 --> 04:03:13,190
All right. Okay. I'm making a house. I'm making a house. I'm making a house. I'm done. I have to

1194
04:03:13,190 --> 04:03:21,030
stop doing this now. My sanity is at stake at the moment. Like, I don't, I don't want to do this.

1195
04:03:21,030 --> 04:03:33,620
This is stupid. But, like, I could make a big... All right. All right. All right. All right. All

1196
04:03:33,620 --> 04:03:38,100
right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I know what I have to do. I know what I

1197
04:03:38,100 --> 04:04:12,069
have to do. I know what I have to do. I'm in too deep. Yeah, I am. Oh, son of a bitch. Sunk cost

1198
04:04:12,069 --> 04:04:23,500
fallacy. Turn up reflections. Okay. Graphics. Brightness. Graphics API. Brightness. Field of

1199
04:04:23,500 --> 04:04:33,860
view. What the fuck is this doing here? Resolution. Advanced. Shadows. Screen space reflection.

1200
04:04:33,860 --> 04:05:04,729
What is that? What do you want? Motion blur. Fog. Make it extreme? Extreme quality. Dude,

1201
04:05:04,729 --> 04:05:29,899
what are you doing? Monsters are going to spawn in the gap. Same Minecraft, man. He said M. He

1202
04:05:29,899 --> 04:05:54,870
said monsters. He said the M word. God. Okay. So, I'm just curious to see what happens. Okay.

1203
04:05:54,870 --> 04:06:04,870
Let me just... Give me one second. Furniture. I'm just going to put a chair in here. Okay. Just

1204
04:06:04,870 --> 04:06:49,690
a swivel chair. Wait. Why is it on in the mirror world but not on in the real world? Let's keep

1205
04:06:49,690 --> 04:07:19,020
going. Such a colossal waste of time. Jojo reference? What did I do? Actually, this is

1206
04:07:19,020 --> 04:07:41,639
starting to take shape. All right. Never mind. Hold on. This is starting to take shape. Dude,

1207
04:07:41,639 --> 04:07:51,850
is that a Jojo mirror? Oh, by the way, I saw an image of me on the internet. Somebody put, like,

1208
04:07:51,850 --> 04:07:57,209
Pokemon sandals on me. People just doctor photos I'm in. People were so excited that

1209
04:07:57,209 --> 04:08:02,170
I was wearing Pokemon sandals in this photo. And that's not real. Somebody put that in. I didn't

1210
04:08:02,170 --> 04:08:17,319
do that. The only thing they doctored in the whole entire picture. Why is this upside down?

1211
04:08:17,319 --> 04:08:51,510
This stream is going to make somebody sick. How do I get out of here? This song is killing me.

1212
04:08:52,870 --> 04:08:59,770
How do I get out? I have to get the fuck out. This song came on and it fucked up everything.

1213
04:09:03,239 --> 04:09:09,100
Okay, get that off. I don't want to hear that one again. I don't want to hear that song ever again.

1214
04:09:25,959 --> 04:09:39,899
Trapped in mirror hell. I'm going to make you guys the home of my dreams. I'm going to do that.

1215
04:09:39,899 --> 04:09:44,340
I'm going to start that shit after the mirror house. I'm getting this one out of the way so

1216
04:09:44,340 --> 04:09:50,889
we can go to the mirror out of here. It's not this. This is not the house of my dreams.

1217
04:09:50,889 --> 04:10:09,139
I'm going to sell this one. There's a guy in the mirror. There's not a guy in the mirror.

1218
04:10:09,780 --> 04:10:25,239
Who are you going to sell it to? Dolan. He's loaded and he doesn't care about any of his money.

1219
04:10:25,239 --> 04:10:34,809
I could probably call Dolan on the phone and say, hey, yo, Dolan. Can you buy my house for

1220
04:10:34,809 --> 04:10:40,969
$400,000? And you just say yes and hang up. Yeah, I'll wire you the money immediately.

1221
04:10:40,969 --> 04:10:45,399
Thanks, Dolan. I can always count on you. Yeah. Hey, if you ever fuck up a whole house again,

1222
04:10:45,399 --> 04:10:48,440
just let me know. If you like burn it down, you like put mirrors everywhere or you fucking like

1223
04:10:48,440 --> 04:10:59,690
torch it. Yeah, just let me know, man. I'll buy it for 500,000 every time. Do a Trump impression.

1224
04:11:02,090 --> 04:11:31,940
Um, why? I can't handle this anymore. I don't even know if those are lined up. I don't care.

1225
04:11:31,940 --> 04:12:01,209
It's fucking me up so bad. No, no, either finish mirror house or you have to do a political stream.

1226
04:12:01,209 --> 04:12:16,170
Um, how about I just say, uh, no. Yeah, I can't wait for, I can't wait for Mr. Slimes to be like

1227
04:12:16,170 --> 04:12:39,180
a political streamer. He would. I'm not going to, I'm kidding. Fast German versus purple alien.

1228
04:12:39,180 --> 04:12:53,030
Is this the music from fast German purple alien? Is it really? Nice. I mean, this is when you catch

1229
04:12:53,030 --> 04:13:12,760
a ghost. I know this one. Okay. Um, I don't even want to go over there. You guys gave me

1230
04:13:12,760 --> 04:13:18,299
Luigi's Mansion soundtrack and it's, it's the worst possible soundtrack to listen to right now.

1231
04:13:26,920 --> 04:13:40,020
Oh, I'm going to lose my mind. Luigi's Mansion two, any good or is it just

1232
04:13:40,020 --> 04:13:57,100
three only play three in one by the disappearing. I think I'm running out of asset space. Yeah.

1233
04:13:57,100 --> 04:14:01,209
It's getting a little sloppy. He's getting a little sloppy. He is. He's getting sloppy.

1234
04:14:01,209 --> 04:14:10,340
I gotta, I have to start to move. I have to get, I have to move. I seriously have to move.

1235
04:14:10,420 --> 04:14:27,610
I can't look at that anymore. Okay. He's going psycho. I'm kind of, man, it's like,

1236
04:14:27,610 --> 04:14:38,309
this is difficult to do and not to have like a freak out. Okay. All right. All right. That's

1237
04:14:38,309 --> 04:14:47,219
fun. That was fun. Let's put some furniture in my house. Let's do, uh, lights. Furniture. I want a

1238
04:14:47,219 --> 04:15:08,780
couch. I want one of these cool things right, uh, right here. More mirrors. Just wait. I'm

1239
04:15:08,780 --> 04:15:31,579
trying to decorate my house. Finish the stairs, but hold on a second. Fucking crack music. I

1240
04:15:31,579 --> 04:15:53,690
swear to God. Furniture. I need to put on, um, dining room table over here. It's just a dining

1241
04:15:53,690 --> 04:16:13,159
room or a kitchen. Um, okay. We'll put the, I can't, I gotta go. I gotta go. I have to stop.

1242
04:16:13,159 --> 04:16:17,659
Stop, stop. Turn it off. Turn the music off. Turn the fucking music off. Turn the music off.

1243
04:16:17,659 --> 04:16:48,760
Turn off the music. I need ceiling lights. Humanity restored.

1244
04:16:48,760 --> 04:16:57,940
I just, I want to just make a house. Why did I have to do this?

1245
04:17:01,430 --> 04:17:30,149
I could have just easily had just made a house with like a TV and here we go. Oh, I can't,

1246
04:17:30,149 --> 04:18:19,139
I can't look at it. I can't look at it. Oh my God. I'm trapped in a nightmare. It's a fucking

1247
04:18:19,139 --> 04:18:47,299
nightmare house. TV. What's big? A bed? Put in a disco ball. I'm actually, I'm actually going to

1248
04:18:47,299 --> 04:18:53,860
move on. I'm, this is going to kill me. I'm, I have to stop doing this. Why can I not stop doing

1249
04:18:53,860 --> 04:19:14,379
this? Why do I want this to crash? Why do I want this to break? I'm going to turn off some of the

1250
04:19:14,379 --> 04:19:47,739
lights. Some of them, only a few of them. I feel like this is what it would be like if I was in a

1251
04:19:47,739 --> 04:19:57,719
human fish tank. Do you know how we put shit in a fish tank? Just like, uh, fish like coral and a

1252
04:19:57,719 --> 04:20:07,610
little castle. Human. Plant a computer sofa and a chair. Oh, I, now I know where I am. This is,

1253
04:20:07,610 --> 04:20:20,219
I know my surroundings. I just open up my mouth and just like meat just falls down. Human fish

1254
04:20:20,219 --> 04:20:43,270
tank. This looks like a bank. This looks normal. Like it looks like a bank. What would you classify

1255
04:20:43,270 --> 04:20:54,659
is odd? It looks like a bank. Oh, get rid of it. Get rid of it. I don't want to look at it.

1256
04:20:54,659 --> 04:21:03,129
Why did I put that up there to taunt myself? All right. I'm making it. I'm selling this house.

1257
04:21:03,129 --> 04:21:08,170
I don't want it anymore. Sell this fucking thing. Sell it. I don't want it. I don't want this. I'm

1258
04:21:08,170 --> 04:21:14,100
done. Sell the house, please. I don't, I'm going to make a real house. No more messing around. No

1259
04:21:14,100 --> 04:21:18,870
more like joke, shitty joke shit. No, I'm not making it bowling alley. I'm not making a movie

1260
04:21:18,870 --> 04:21:24,120
theater. Although there could be a cool sick theater in there. Auction. I don't want it.

1261
04:21:24,120 --> 04:21:51,909
Put a disco ball. It's actually going for a lot. Was it the mirrors? Holy shit. Fuck the disco ball.

1262
04:21:51,909 --> 04:22:24,729
I'm just taking it. Why is it taking so many? You know, the house is fucked up. I got a tip

1263
04:22:24,729 --> 04:22:30,649
for you guys. When the realtor is only taking pictures of the same room from 10 different

1264
04:22:30,649 --> 04:22:40,389
angles. Probably might want to skip that one. When they just show you a photo of the outside

1265
04:22:40,389 --> 04:22:47,129
of the house and one of the bathrooms and you know that it's like 1400 square feet. Don't go

1266
04:22:47,129 --> 04:23:00,420
to that one. And look at that. Don't go to this one. But Dolan just buys every house. So who cares?

1267
04:23:00,420 --> 04:23:05,610
He has a grand scheme where he's going to own all the property in whatever town this is.

1268
04:23:05,610 --> 04:23:17,450
And he's going to be a mogul. Do they update this game a lot? From, from what I gather, I believe so.

1269
04:23:21,799 --> 04:23:25,559
There's been at least two or three major major updates to this game in the last couple of years,

1270
04:23:25,559 --> 04:23:34,680
right? Okay. I'm doing a real house. Real house. No more messing around. I'm going to get a real

1271
04:23:34,680 --> 04:23:42,090
house and I'm going to make it the way that I would. I would, my dream home. Okay. I have to do

1272
04:23:42,090 --> 04:24:06,170
this. Which one do I want though? Hmm. Family house. Man cave. Oh yeah. All right. Let's do the man

1273
04:24:06,170 --> 04:24:22,010
cave. Let's go. I'm ready. Now I'm sorry. I just punched you in the face. I'm ready. So let's take

1274
04:24:22,010 --> 04:24:34,010
a look. What are we, what are we working with here? Oh, okay. This is coming down. What's this for?

1275
04:24:34,729 --> 04:24:40,819
World's best dad. Well, we know who lived here before. It's a Reddit house. I got to have the

1276
04:24:40,819 --> 04:24:49,159
streaming room. Okay. This is going to be my garage. It is a garage. Right. Here's the streamer room.

1277
04:24:49,159 --> 04:24:52,680
There's going to be one. I'm going to do the, I'm going to make my exact fucking room.

1278
04:24:52,680 --> 04:25:03,559
Make the Reddit. This is the Reddit house. What a huge fucking yard. All right. We're going to go

1279
04:25:03,559 --> 04:25:25,579
outside, outside first. The spray can. Make Otto's room. I need to cut the lawn. I should have a

1280
04:25:25,579 --> 04:25:46,100
little like tomato garden back here. Yup. Use the lawnmower. I don't have one. I don't have a

1281
04:25:46,100 --> 04:25:56,620
lawnmower. Where do I get it? Flamethrower. Oh, I can burn the grass. You're right. I have to buy

1282
04:25:56,620 --> 04:26:20,340
one in the store. I'm out of fuel. Okay. Fuel for the flamethrower. Refueled. That's so much faster

1283
04:26:20,340 --> 04:26:39,139
than mowing the lawn. And I pull the goggles down and look over. Hey Tim, there's a hot one today.

1284
04:26:39,780 --> 04:27:08,420
You're killing the grass. Oops. It's okay Jim. Yolan will fix it. I didn't want that shit

1285
04:27:08,420 --> 04:27:33,979
anyways. Who wants that? This is so much faster. This is so much faster. Why clean when you can

1286
04:27:33,979 --> 04:27:48,299
just burn your house down? You're the neighbor looking in here. Oh my God. Mike's finally lost

1287
04:27:48,299 --> 04:28:12,700
his mind. Just taking care of some yard work. You know, by the way Jim, that tree's kind of hanging

1288
04:28:12,700 --> 04:28:20,420
a little bit far over on my side of the property, don't you think? By the way, flip us around and

1289
04:28:20,420 --> 04:28:33,290
pretend I'm you saying that. What I meant to say was I'll take care of it. I did it in the

1290
04:28:33,290 --> 04:28:48,069
reverse way. You get it Jim. You get it. We're buddies. We know each other. He's mirror mad.

1291
04:28:48,629 --> 04:29:09,100
Oh wait, I am actually killing all the grass. I am. I actually am. Act's not available yet. What?

1292
04:29:09,659 --> 04:29:17,350
The way you don't understand it when you do it this way, you never have to have a lawn. You never

1293
04:29:17,350 --> 04:29:27,579
have to mow the lawn. Never have to cut the grass. Never have to take care of it ever. It's just gone.

1294
04:29:28,299 --> 04:29:39,129
I thought this was going to take like two hours to do this out here. Nope. This is so much quicker.

1295
04:29:45,129 --> 04:30:46,020
WM1. Lawn mower. Wait, why am I adding grass? Yo, you melted the driveway. Oh, oh, okay. Wait,

1296
04:30:46,020 --> 04:31:11,530
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I mean, this is very important. Give me one second. Okay, I just need

1297
04:31:11,530 --> 04:31:33,579
this. This is important for me to do this. Hold on. Where is it? I need, I need the crit sound. Okay,

1298
04:31:33,579 --> 04:31:56,340
we're good. I need to be able to press this a shitload of times. Here we go. Okay, we're good.

1299
04:31:57,590 --> 04:32:08,329
Give me one sec. I'm just going to add this to my stream deck. This is going to be a audio.

1300
04:32:09,659 --> 04:32:22,299
Random crits. Yeah. The back burner. I'm back-burnering my house. Okay.

1301
04:32:25,850 --> 04:32:42,139
Play audio. Audio comes from. Just download it. There it is. Where did that download to? Shit.

1302
04:32:42,139 --> 04:32:50,069
Hold on. Is it on desktop? It's on, it's on desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop, desktop,

1303
04:32:50,069 --> 04:33:01,030
desktop. There it is. Okay. Here we go. Let's test it. It works. Okay. This is play.

1304
04:33:01,930 --> 04:33:33,139
L fade. All right. And let's go ahead and start to play the game. I'm playing. Hey,

1305
04:33:33,139 --> 04:34:07,180
Jim. Not the house. Oh shit. The new pyro update. The fucking hose. You got to land it directly on

1306
04:34:07,180 --> 04:34:17,849
their fucking head. Nice. I love this fucking target map. How do they add this? That'd be awesome.

1307
04:34:17,849 --> 04:34:32,869
If there was like a water spray can. All right. What was I doing? What was I doing?

1308
04:34:32,869 --> 04:35:04,020
Flamethrower. Not bad. This was going to take so long. Not anymore. Okay. How come this doesn't

1309
04:35:04,020 --> 04:35:13,779
take off the graffiti? I'm going to pave the whole backyard anyways. Don't worry. This is

1310
04:35:13,779 --> 04:35:23,849
supposed to be my dream. My man cave. I mean, there's going to be four basketball courts or

1311
04:35:23,849 --> 04:35:39,189
as it leaves the grass, more muscle. That's cool. I missed a spot. I know I'm going to get it.

1312
04:35:39,189 --> 04:35:56,569
I'm actually probably better off. Okay. It's ready to be cleaned. I'm probably better off just using

1313
04:35:56,569 --> 04:36:18,540
the actual mower now. It must be burned. All right. Look at that. It was so overgrown with

1314
04:36:18,540 --> 04:36:25,029
vegetation and now it looks great. It looks flat. I need to get rid of this in the front.

1315
04:36:25,669 --> 04:36:35,979
Not that much more. This, it doesn't want to get destroyed for some reason.

1316
04:36:40,540 --> 04:36:47,029
Mini golf. Oh yeah. Yeah. All right. I'll get, let me, I'll do this later. I've got to clean.

1317
04:36:47,029 --> 04:37:16,060
Eep world's best dad. Maybe. Maybe. Okay. That's fine. I'm going to clean the windows.

1318
04:37:16,060 --> 04:37:22,439
This is just so messed up. It's going to need a complete overhaul.

1319
04:37:23,000 --> 04:37:47,159
There is something about no one will ever be able to replicate this. TF2 did this the way that you

1320
04:37:47,159 --> 04:37:57,220
felt after hearing that sequence of crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit,

1321
04:37:57,220 --> 04:38:06,069
something about it. It was the most, it was like dopamine just flooding into your brain.

1322
04:38:06,069 --> 04:38:10,150
No game will ever be able to, I don't think we'd ever be able to make that feel like that again.

1323
04:38:10,150 --> 04:38:24,650
When you shot two crit rockets in a row in TF2, nothing can replace that. Especially if you did

1324
04:38:24,650 --> 04:38:28,169
it into like a little corridor and you do those like six people in there and it was just, it just

1325
04:38:28,169 --> 04:38:38,279
went like this. You just heard it. You'd go, it was like, Whoa, look at the kill. I got six people.

1326
04:38:38,279 --> 04:38:51,639
It was amazing being on the receiving end of that though, was like uninstalled TF2. Why

1327
04:38:51,639 --> 04:39:04,939
there random crits? This game's nice job valve random crits, huh? They hear this place out.

1328
04:39:09,000 --> 04:39:13,159
Like you would hear that noise or no, you would not hear that noise. You didn't get to hear it.

1329
04:39:13,159 --> 04:39:16,900
That's the worst part. If you get hit by a random crit, you don't get to hear the cool noise. You

1330
04:39:16,900 --> 04:39:47,419
just explode. Does it play fall guys? Um, no, not right now. Okay. World's best dad. Can I,

1331
04:39:47,419 --> 04:39:53,900
I don't think I can go around this. I mean, I guess I could put, I could put a bureau here

1332
04:39:53,979 --> 04:40:07,939
and just block this out until it's just world's best dad. Play Mario maker. Didn't I make,

1333
04:40:08,580 --> 04:40:16,740
I made like a Mario maker reference today. What was it? They don't remember what it was. Like,

1334
04:40:16,740 --> 04:40:28,169
Oh yeah. How like Mario maker. Why did I say that earlier? It was yesterday.

1335
04:40:28,169 --> 04:40:37,139
You go many extremely thinks he's the best dad. That was a good game. You were calling your fake

1336
04:40:37,139 --> 04:40:54,389
friend. Oh, right, right. Okay. I'll just loser thinks you can make a better dad than anyone.

1337
04:40:55,189 --> 04:41:02,490
I think I'd be okay. I think I'd be a pretty good dad.

1338
04:41:04,869 --> 04:41:30,330
Okay. So every night that's well, that's not a cool dad. I have a funny story for you. So we

1339
04:41:30,330 --> 04:41:37,290
get, we gave Otto this new food because of his Addison's and we're trying to like get him on

1340
04:41:37,290 --> 04:41:46,389
some like better food and different food. Uh, so I've been given it to him and a friend of mine

1341
04:41:46,389 --> 04:41:54,419
was here and the friend of mine saw me put this, this fresh like dog food into his bowl

1342
04:41:55,849 --> 04:42:00,970
and he thought I was giving the dog queso. He really thought that's what it was. He was like,

1343
04:42:00,970 --> 04:42:09,659
what are you doing? Cause it's in this, like this weird package. It like you like dump it out. And

1344
04:42:09,659 --> 04:42:15,430
he was just like, why are you doing, why are you feeding your dog queso? And something about like

1345
04:42:15,430 --> 04:42:22,819
that was just making me fucking die laughing. I'm like, why would somebody do that? Just give

1346
04:42:22,819 --> 04:42:28,659
your dog queso every day. Like that's fucking insane. Like, why do you think I was doing this?

1347
04:42:28,659 --> 04:42:37,180
There's already a man cave down here. I can't even make it mine. Is that picture of Elvis?

1348
04:42:37,180 --> 04:42:54,229
Who is that picture of? I don't know. Oh, lucky, lucky. No, this man cave is not, I don't want this

1349
04:42:54,229 --> 04:43:18,259
stuff. This is my standup comedy studio. That's where I practice all my new jokes. What are you

1350
04:43:18,259 --> 04:43:27,540
doing? Pick it up. Any golf? Yeah. Yeah. We got to clean this place up a little bit first. What's

1351
04:43:27,540 --> 04:43:46,119
wrong here? Why is there, why is there like consecration on the walls? Does it do anything?

1352
04:43:47,240 --> 04:43:56,759
Did I get it? Oh, what? How can I, I can't remove these. I burnt it all. That's why

1353
04:43:57,479 --> 04:44:17,720
I cannot remove these. That's annoying. The house is clean. There's one more piece. It's right here

1354
04:44:17,720 --> 04:44:28,860
somewhere. I can't, where is it? Did I get it? Cool. What color does the house, is the house going

1355
04:44:28,860 --> 04:44:43,669
to be? What color does the house want to be? I'm thinking make it purple, make it a mirror. No,

1356
04:44:43,669 --> 04:44:55,560
we're not doing that again. Not happening. Okay. How about, what about walls? Uh, light colored

1357
04:44:55,560 --> 04:45:03,130
medium panels, pistachio. This is kind of, yeah, this is like a Rocco's modern life house.

1358
04:45:03,930 --> 04:45:22,060
I'll try this. Yeah. All right. It's like Rocco's modern life. His house, the Rocco's modern life

1359
04:45:22,060 --> 04:45:36,139
looked like this. The cartoon house. This is a nineties house. Oh, actually, I don't know. Is

1360
04:45:36,139 --> 04:45:51,799
this supposed to be my dream house? I can't do that. I can't decide. All right. This is a bathroom.

1361
04:45:52,439 --> 04:45:56,409
Let me think of what I want. When I walk in my house. Okay. I'm closing my eyes.

1362
04:45:57,290 --> 04:46:07,189
Walk in. What am I looking at? Got a place to put my like keys right here. Okay. Kitchen right here.

1363
04:46:08,330 --> 04:46:14,500
Yep. Okay. Kitchen. This leads over to the, this is my little living room area.

1364
04:46:15,220 --> 04:46:21,509
I don't know if I want the bathroom there. I don't know. There's only one bathroom.

1365
04:46:22,229 --> 04:46:35,509
What is this place? Bedroom? Bedroom. Garage. Okay. Garage down to here. Maybe this should be.

1366
04:46:36,869 --> 04:46:41,290
Yeah. Okay. Stream. We'll start with the stream room. I'm going to make the stream room that I

1367
04:46:41,290 --> 04:46:51,930
want. All right. Stream room time. Here we go. Where is this? I need a stream room. This is,

1368
04:46:52,009 --> 04:47:01,900
this is bedroom. Bedroom. Bathroom. I need a stream room. Take the basement, the gamer room.

1369
04:47:03,509 --> 04:47:13,770
No, no, no, no. I can't. No, no. It's got to be a separate thing. Bedroom. Stream room. Basement

1370
04:47:13,770 --> 04:47:28,569
for VR. Okay. Yeah. We'll do this. We'll make a wall here. Kitchen. Where's the TV going to go?

1371
04:47:28,569 --> 04:47:48,700
This place is too small. TV here. Couch there. I think so. Just buy a bigger house. Well,

1372
04:47:48,700 --> 04:48:18,229
I've already committed. All right. So this is going to be the stream room. The glass house.

1373
04:48:18,229 --> 04:48:23,240
No, it's not. This is going to be, it's going to be nice. Use the scroll wheel to make the sections

1374
04:48:23,240 --> 04:48:31,509
larger. Thank you. Wow. You just saved me like a hundred years. Okay. Now we need to make

1375
04:48:32,389 --> 04:48:52,009
the door here. How big is it? One, two, three. That's good. Right. The basement is going to be

1376
04:48:52,009 --> 04:49:07,139
sick. Don't worry. This is the streamer room. Okay. The desk is going to go here. I have an

1377
04:49:07,139 --> 04:49:17,430
L-shaped desk and I've got the one, two, three monitors. Okay. Let's go to type in desk.

1378
04:49:23,029 --> 04:49:38,310
No, here we are. There we are. This is Walnut too. Already. It's the exact one. This is my desk.

1379
04:49:47,580 --> 04:49:57,349
Wait, that's wrong. What? Why does this feel incorrect? How would you sit here and touch the,

1380
04:50:00,470 --> 04:50:13,540
it's like that, right? I want it to be like that. Shit. I can't, I built it the wrong way. Whatever.

1381
04:50:15,509 --> 04:50:22,330
Okay. There's that. I need to make, I need to get my book and my office max,

1382
04:50:22,330 --> 04:50:50,459
Quadro 4000. Spell it right. For God sakes. Okay. Chair. Oh, I mean, you have to.

1383
04:50:56,759 --> 04:51:07,740
This is gigantic. How is this bigger than the desk? I don't know. Every time I see one of these,

1384
04:51:07,740 --> 04:51:12,060
I honestly, I just think about it's going to lean back and the dentist is going to come in

1385
04:51:12,060 --> 04:51:27,500
and just start drilling my teeth. Queso chair. Now we need monitors. Computer. What kind of

1386
04:51:27,500 --> 04:51:40,950
computer do I have? Uh, probably like this one. And it's under here. My computer sits under here.

1387
04:51:41,669 --> 04:51:55,159
Okay. Then what do you mean? What the fuck is? Oh yes. It's on the floor. Under floor, under the

1388
04:51:55,159 --> 04:52:09,159
desk, except on the other side. All right. Now we need monitor. Holy shit. I don't have that though.

1389
04:52:09,799 --> 04:52:22,459
That's me lying to you. I don't have that monitor HD. Not it either.

1390
04:52:29,979 --> 04:52:36,520
Monitor. I just need the little ones. I, I need to do my setup. There we are. Okay. Here we go.

1391
04:52:36,520 --> 04:52:44,900
Ready? This is what it looks like. I know people are being like this. You know, you gotta, you gotta

1392
04:52:44,900 --> 04:53:16,869
look at a glimpse into my life. Three. Yeah. Three. All right. That's good. Where's the keyboard? I'm

1393
04:53:17,509 --> 04:53:28,380
working on it. Backlit keyboard brushy. Oh, that's actually kind of scary. This is, this is the one

1394
04:53:28,380 --> 04:54:03,799
I use. Nice. Okay. Now we need a mouse. Gaming mouse pad. And then a mouse. Okay. That looks good.

1395
04:54:03,799 --> 04:54:19,419
And then what else is in here? There's a Reddit shelf behind me. This is pretty close. Where's,

1396
04:54:19,419 --> 04:54:30,250
no, there's, there's one that looks like this. Where is it? Soap is tables, desk, chairs, beds,

1397
04:54:30,250 --> 04:54:47,159
armchairs. Decorations? No. Where is it? It's not walls. Is it a bookcase? Installations? No.

1398
04:54:47,159 --> 04:55:06,009
Decorations? Accessories? No. Where is it? Put a step stool in there. No, I don't think so. I mean,

1399
04:55:06,009 --> 04:55:26,259
I would like to have a sauna. Books? Where? I've seen it. Where the hell is it? Oh well. Oh well.

1400
04:55:26,259 --> 04:55:44,779
Other? Whoa. What's this? Aquarium? That'd be cool. Shelf? Yeah. I, I, you think it would just

1401
04:55:44,779 --> 04:55:56,220
show up under shelf. It looks like this, except it's, it's kind of tilted. This is, this will do.

1402
04:55:59,959 --> 04:56:14,099
Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. Furniture. I don't see it.

1403
04:56:17,060 --> 04:56:23,830
Wait. I think this is it. Hold on. Yep. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got it. You got it.

1404
04:56:24,790 --> 04:56:47,400
It kind of looks like this one, right? And then we got to put like a bunch of sound paneling all

1405
04:56:47,400 --> 04:56:58,619
over the walls. First, I want to paint this lime green. Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1406
04:56:58,619 --> 04:57:13,340
a spearmint green. Spearmint green. Paint. Here we go. Uh, faded lemon. Not a bad choice.

1407
04:57:14,599 --> 04:57:24,009
Spring grass. There it is. Oh, I love it. I love this color so much. It's just, it makes me feel

1408
04:57:24,009 --> 04:57:33,909
so good. This is a little too dark. This is too dark. It's, it has to be lighter than this,

1409
04:57:33,909 --> 04:58:03,740
but this is the closest it's going to get. Slime room. Guts room. It kind of is a Nickelodeon room,

1410
04:58:03,740 --> 04:58:15,720
but that's all right. It is a Nickelodeon room. It's because of that chair. It's the yellow chair.

1411
04:58:16,439 --> 04:58:25,099
Orange, whatever. You need a bucket of plaster. Oh, fuck off. All right. Let's get a bucket of

1412
04:58:25,099 --> 04:58:43,209
plaster. Uh, I think that mirror house changed me forever. I'm like, I'm like forever a different

1413
04:58:43,209 --> 04:59:14,869
person. You okay? Same, to be honest. So is Desperados 3 actually a good game? I want to play

1414
04:59:14,869 --> 04:59:27,990
it, but I had to, there was a promise I had to keep. I believe it is. Music being off makes this

1415
04:59:27,990 --> 04:59:43,259
really strange. Yeah, it kind of does. How about, um, sounds like another, uh, it's a generic shooter.

1416
04:59:43,979 --> 05:00:02,259
No, no more scary shit. Hackman World 2. Silent Hill is scary shit. Hackman World OST,

1417
05:00:02,259 --> 05:00:12,979
full soundtrack. All right, nice. I'm looking forward to this. I love this guy. All right,

1418
05:00:12,979 --> 05:00:18,419
let's do it. That's enough of the green. I think it looks good. I don't want the wood though.

1419
05:00:18,419 --> 05:00:24,819
Remember, I'm a carpet guy. I know, you know, punching, punch him, punch him, get him, kick

1420
05:00:24,819 --> 05:00:35,479
his ass, right? I know. That wasn't meant to be a joke. I know, don't make the crickets thing.

1421
05:00:36,119 --> 05:00:45,830
Okay. Floor. Floor, panels, and covering. Here we go. Green carpet. No, I'd like a, like a, like a

1422
05:00:45,830 --> 05:00:57,849
gray, a gray or a little blue. So gray carpet. I think I'm into the, the, this one can blend in

1423
05:00:57,849 --> 05:01:15,560
pretty well. That would have let the dog in. This is just like what the, this is what you hear if

1424
05:01:15,560 --> 05:01:27,049
you're a fucking Mike's neighbor. Hey Jim. Oh, just throwing my trash out the second story window,

1425
05:01:27,130 --> 05:01:51,340
trying to land it into the trash can. Have a good day. Why does he keep using Let's Plays for OST?

1426
05:01:53,259 --> 05:02:04,169
This is Pac-Man world OST full soundtrack, high quality. All right, that looks nice. The green

1427
05:02:04,169 --> 05:02:10,250
doesn't work. It's not the right green. It's not the right, it has to change. It's not the right

1428
05:02:10,250 --> 05:02:29,610
green. It just isn't. Wait, is it pistachio or is it ice blue? Is it pistachio? You know, don't do

1429
05:02:29,610 --> 05:02:58,490
that. There's no mirrors to do that with. I like it. This is not a Let's Play. You're missing the

1430
05:02:58,490 --> 05:03:15,779
plot. Shit, I'm missing the plot of Pac-Man world two. There we are. That's nicer. I said this is a

1431
05:03:15,779 --> 05:03:34,229
Miku room. Um, let's just say blue room. This is like water. Robin's egg. This is Robin's egg blue.

1432
05:03:34,869 --> 05:03:49,159
This is not Miku blue. It's not what it says on the can. What? This is a song. Miku blue.

1433
05:03:52,900 --> 05:04:10,950
I like it. It's a great color. It's just like, it's teal. We're not going to replace the word

1434
05:04:10,950 --> 05:04:30,090
teal with Miku blue. I'm sorry. I'm not participating. What else is even in this room? Christmas door?

1435
05:04:30,090 --> 05:04:49,450
What's a Christmas door? All right, internal door white. That works. What about the soundproofing?

1436
05:04:49,450 --> 05:05:05,529
I'll do it. Okay, good. Wait, it's not good. It's not lined up right. Looks like shit is what it

1437
05:05:05,529 --> 05:05:28,919
looks like. Why does it look so wrong? This looks like we leaned it in here and just didn't install

1438
05:05:28,919 --> 05:05:36,650
it. All right, son, be very, very careful. Don't put too much weight on the door because it's not

1439
05:05:36,650 --> 05:05:55,529
actually in there. It's just standing. There we go. That's a little odd. I'll fix it later.

1440
05:05:55,529 --> 05:06:05,860
Remember, still going strong. Yeah, I'll probably finish up here pretty soon, but I kind of want to

1441
05:06:05,860 --> 05:06:09,700
do this tomorrow and we'll play desperate. Okay, listen, I'm going to promise you something. We're

1442
05:06:09,700 --> 05:06:19,380
going to play Desperado's three tomorrow, but I'm going to do this too. Okay, I have to make you guys

1443
05:06:19,380 --> 05:06:29,619
my whole house. More house flipper. Yeah, I'm going to open with this. We'll play this for a little

1444
05:06:29,619 --> 05:06:42,380
while and then we'll move to Desperado's three when I'm done with my new house. When am I going to end?

1445
05:06:43,459 --> 05:06:50,580
Um, I don't know. Probably soon though. We are encroaching on like the five plus hour mark

1446
05:06:50,580 --> 05:06:53,939
and that's when I need to start to be cautious of how long I've been sitting down,

1447
05:06:56,700 --> 05:07:07,900
but we're good. Desperado's is going to get shafted. It's not, I promise. What else is,

1448
05:07:07,900 --> 05:07:11,659
that's all I have in my room. Everyone thinks, dude, I wonder what's like in any interesting

1449
05:07:11,659 --> 05:07:37,159
shit in like a streamer's room. No, wait, hold on. Hold on a minute. Uh, let me fix it. You want to

1450
05:07:37,159 --> 05:07:46,650
see what it looks like? What a streamer's room looks like? Is there any bags of trash that are

1451
05:07:46,650 --> 05:08:06,599
available? Give me one second. Give me one second. I, I need to turn the camera on just so you guys

1452
05:08:06,599 --> 05:09:12,299
can fucking understand what I'm talking about here. One sec. Okay. So I didn't do anything.

1453
05:09:13,020 --> 05:09:23,700
I had to just get this out of the way. Just like clockwork. Right. Right. Right. Okay. So

1454
05:09:24,580 --> 05:09:30,470
I'm going to show you guys the ground in my room. I don't know why some of this stuff is even here.

1455
05:09:41,459 --> 05:09:46,919
Yes, by the way, those of you that are asking, I know I'm going to get a lot of questions about

1456
05:09:46,919 --> 05:09:51,959
this, but there's a very specific reason why. No, that's not going to be shit on the ground.

1457
05:09:54,500 --> 05:10:12,939
Hope not. Uh, there's like a trash bag, this Elmo and like a bunch of cords and shit.

1458
05:10:19,099 --> 05:10:29,060
That's not a torture me Elmo. No, I don't know why that's in here. I really don't know.

1459
05:10:33,319 --> 05:10:55,340
That's like, I, Kim got that stuff for some reason. It's not a torture me Elmo. This room is a

1460
05:10:55,340 --> 05:11:07,110
fucking mess, but I have to clean it. I know, but that's what I'm saying. I was trying to go,

1461
05:11:07,110 --> 05:11:16,700
I wish I could go find the trash bags that I deleted. You have your documents all over the

1462
05:11:16,700 --> 05:11:34,229
floor. Yeah. I did that before. Oh, cool. That actually lights up perfectly. Okay. That looks

1463
05:11:34,229 --> 05:11:42,470
good. There's not trash in there by the way. It's storage. When you run out of places to put shit,

1464
05:11:42,470 --> 05:11:44,709
it's like, okay, what am I going to do with that? I'm going to put this in a trash bag.

1465
05:11:44,709 --> 05:11:52,919
That's all I have right now. It's storage right now. That's not trash. That's storage.

1466
05:11:52,919 --> 05:11:57,560
Why a trash bag? Cause it's a huge thing that like all the commercials, you can't rip through

1467
05:11:57,560 --> 05:12:00,680
them. They're so hefty. They're so hard to break through. So why don't you use it for like a bunch

1468
05:12:00,680 --> 05:12:09,740
of shit? All right. I got that room. This is literally the cleanest my fake room has ever been.

1469
05:12:09,740 --> 05:12:35,450
The food. Okay. I also need, um, like laptop. What's going on? Socks. What is going on?

1470
05:12:42,619 --> 05:12:58,470
It's Christmas time at the streamer room. The disc is skipping. No, get this out of here. No,

1471
05:12:58,470 --> 05:13:02,790
I'm a clean guy. Right? I need to do the, the, okay, this is the, I'll show you. This is,

1472
05:13:02,790 --> 05:13:11,979
this is going to be fun. I just need, um, just like foam walls. It might actually have to be,

1473
05:13:12,540 --> 05:13:18,580
I don't know, like what would, what's just like a, like a thing that's like a square that's black

1474
05:13:21,220 --> 05:13:32,459
like a hang clean or not. You have to eat. Yeah. I know a box, a mirror. No,

1475
05:13:36,900 --> 05:13:41,099
got to be able to sit on the wall. This guy has to be one of the lights.

1476
05:13:41,740 --> 05:13:48,090
It has never turned on. I'm supposed to make my streamer room. If I don't have all my cool foam,

1477
05:13:48,090 --> 05:14:06,819
dude. Damn it. Oh, nevermind. You search foam. I would, why foam be here? Maybe a painting.

1478
05:14:07,380 --> 05:14:14,299
I'd have to upload a custom painting. Yeah. I'll use a picture of it. Yeah. I'll do that tomorrow.

1479
05:14:17,930 --> 05:14:26,250
Oh, that whatever. I just saw it and I just, I cleaned it off. Okay. Here goes the, there it is.

1480
05:14:27,540 --> 05:14:36,700
So here's the front door. I need, first of all, what do I want to have my floor here? I think I'm,

1481
05:14:36,700 --> 05:14:59,959
that looks kind of nice. Yeah, it does. I love it. I love the smokiness to it. Tile floor, tile floor,

1482
05:14:59,959 --> 05:15:06,439
tile floor, tile house. Um, I'm not sure how many of you guys live in the Southwestern United States.

1483
05:15:07,240 --> 05:15:26,619
Um, you got, you gotta have some tile somewhere. Shit gets hot, hot, hot. Oh, this is, I like this.

1484
05:15:26,619 --> 05:15:34,409
I really like it. I really like this. This is sick. Okay. Now we need a cool, uh, kitchen

1485
05:15:35,349 --> 05:15:48,939
panels. How about, hmm, maybe, um, maybe like this, like a sand, sand. I think I like this, a sand.

1486
05:15:56,340 --> 05:16:03,540
At least you're having fun. Yeah. Oh yeah. This music is a little kind of getting to me though.

1487
05:16:04,099 --> 05:16:08,380
That's better. It's a little, it's too much. It's like playing in my brain.

1488
05:16:10,169 --> 05:16:33,220
Ball panels. What a cream. Cream works. Look at that. This is a house that you can just look

1489
05:16:33,220 --> 05:16:55,500
so good. You could just eat it. This is resident sleeper. Don't resident sleeper me. Don't do it.

1490
05:16:55,500 --> 05:17:01,849
Don't you do it. You guys like keeping logs of me. Well, I got logs of all you resident sleepers.

1491
05:17:02,409 --> 05:17:20,259
I don't know. How does it look bad? Now we brighten this up a little bit. We add a little,

1492
05:17:20,259 --> 05:17:37,209
we get some color in here. Eat them. No mirrors. That's the, I can't. Okay. Can I nominate just

1493
05:17:37,209 --> 05:17:42,950
the portion of the mirrors for worst stream in 2020? Like I can, I do that. Just that portion,

1494
05:17:42,950 --> 05:17:48,599
just like that, like 30 minutes. That's all. Everything else has been really fun,

1495
05:17:48,599 --> 05:17:56,229
but like I hurt my, my, my body hurts from that. My whole body hurts. All right. Cool. Nice. Nice.

1496
05:17:56,389 --> 05:18:11,750
Clean these windows. Yes. Another two month break. These are the mirrors.

1497
05:18:13,029 --> 05:18:22,259
I remember because this is my, uh, save file. Remember how long this takes when you don't have

1498
05:18:22,259 --> 05:18:34,889
any of the upgrades is so horrible. What the fuck are they saying? Cigarette house, something house,

1499
05:18:34,889 --> 05:18:46,970
something house, cigarette house. Do not say that because I will make like a filter and then the

1500
05:18:46,970 --> 05:18:52,569
actual cigarette and then the yellow, I'll make the cigarette house. I'm not doing mirror too.

1501
05:18:53,209 --> 05:19:42,939
What are you doing? Why is it not showing up? Where is it? There's this, this is not a,

1502
05:19:44,069 --> 05:19:47,669
no, I'm not even giving, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of me saying it.

1503
05:19:48,740 --> 05:19:56,740
This is not that this is not a cigarette house. This is smoky white and black and, and like cream

1504
05:19:57,380 --> 05:20:00,659
with some accents. It's going to be some black furniture. There'll be a couple,

1505
05:20:00,659 --> 05:20:11,619
there'll be maybe some oranges here. It's looks, this is a good look. Okay. So

1506
05:20:12,819 --> 05:20:18,259
not all the walls have to be like that. Just these ones here. All right. Let's go this way.

1507
05:20:18,259 --> 05:20:49,380
This is the mega milk house. It's Oreo cookies and cream. That's a good look. It's not a cookie.

1508
05:20:50,259 --> 05:21:06,439
Okay. Lower. I'm going to put a wall here. God damn it. This is a school cafeteria.

1509
05:21:28,119 --> 05:21:32,709
Why does it have to be perfect? You could have said anything else and it could have been kind

1510
05:21:32,709 --> 05:21:40,009
of accurate, but it is so accurate that it's making me angry how accurate it is. So angry.

1511
05:21:53,430 --> 05:22:01,290
That's pretty good. That's got to be best chat joke of the week. I think it's up there for me

1512
05:22:01,290 --> 05:22:24,650
for sure. Okay. Oh, this room's ugly. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Okay. I need another. What the hell is this

1513
05:22:24,650 --> 05:22:40,439
room? It's a 12 year old room. What? I want to know the 12 year old that has a triple monitor

1514
05:22:40,439 --> 05:22:49,299
gamer room set up. Hey, what, what, what is, what do I always say? If that's the case,

1515
05:22:50,229 --> 05:22:58,979
how many plants they got in there? How many plants they got in the corner of their houses?

1516
05:22:58,979 --> 05:23:09,740
When I was a kid, I had this whole shit box HB computer that the tent was wrong and it got

1517
05:23:09,740 --> 05:23:17,740
really hot. It was the shittiest computer ever and it got super hot and I was sweating my room

1518
05:23:17,740 --> 05:23:31,880
all the time. I would play Diablo 2 on it and Team Fortress classic. Make the green room meat wads

1519
05:23:31,880 --> 05:23:53,909
room. You guys, are you guys, how are you guys this on point today? Holy shit. You guys are on

1520
05:23:53,909 --> 05:24:01,959
fire today. This is the Aqua teen house. Isn't this Frylock's room? Doesn't he have like a cool

1521
05:24:01,959 --> 05:24:11,220
computer? This is Frylock's room. This is Meatwad's room. And then this is Shake's room. This is the

1522
05:24:11,220 --> 05:24:17,419
TVs right here. No, no more cartoon houses. I don't want to make a family guy. I don't want

1523
05:24:17,419 --> 05:24:22,549
to make the Simpsons. I don't want to make Aqua teen. Yes. Holy, this is the Aqua teen house.

1524
05:24:22,549 --> 05:24:44,680
That's the exact house. How did this happen? I don't understand why you're an idiot and I'm

1525
05:24:44,680 --> 05:24:50,180
going to throw this thing on the floor and it's going to explode. And I don't know what you're

1526
05:24:50,180 --> 05:24:55,799
talking about, man. I think you're going to shut your mouth. The little guy has a mouth on him,

1527
05:24:55,799 --> 05:25:08,630
I think. That's too bad. What's going on in here? I'm leaving. I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm

1528
05:25:08,630 --> 05:25:13,110
gone. I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm out. I'm out. I'll see you tomorrow. I was so bad. I have to fucking

1529
05:25:13,110 --> 05:25:30,060
end the stream. I have to turn the stream up because that was so awful. Jera's life is a

1530
05:25:30,060 --> 05:25:35,419
cartoon. No, it just happens. It just ends up that way for no reason. It just ends up like this.

1531
05:25:37,290 --> 05:25:53,240
I have no control over this. All right. I'm fixing this end of stream fry lock. I'm so

1532
05:25:53,240 --> 05:26:17,430
fucked up right now. All right. I got to get a front door. This guy's fucked up. I'm not

1533
05:26:17,430 --> 05:26:26,299
fucked up. You're fucked up. Oh, it's not me. It's you. I didn't do anything. And by the way,

1534
05:26:26,939 --> 05:26:32,729
Merry fucking Christmas. No, no, that's not how I'm going to end this. I'm not ending it that way.

1535
05:26:34,779 --> 05:26:44,840
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to. Okay. I'm done. Everybody just relax. Okay. I'm going to

1536
05:26:44,840 --> 05:27:04,419
do the bathroom. Whoa. Look at all this stuff. There's an AC unit. An amountable AC unit. A

1537
05:27:05,139 --> 05:27:16,220
unit. Stop. Stop it. You guys are a bad influence. No, let's just. What about for walls in here?

1538
05:27:21,049 --> 05:27:31,750
Uh, I'm thinking I'll do a grandma house or Minecraft grandma house or I've only played

1539
05:27:31,750 --> 05:28:07,319
Minecraft for two hours. My whole house looks like this. Uh, 3D is a 3D. Yeah. That's fucking

1540
05:28:07,319 --> 05:28:23,979
ugly. It looks like instead of a beehive, sell this shit. Get this out of here. Here's the,

1541
05:28:23,979 --> 05:28:30,380
okay. The problem that I have with decorating places is I, everything that is not just gray,

1542
05:28:30,380 --> 05:28:38,709
white or beige, just, it's just crazy, right? It just looks crazy. How do you design anything?

1543
05:28:38,709 --> 05:29:08,970
I don't understand. How do people make anything look good? Like this just looks crazy. This is

1544
05:29:08,970 --> 05:29:28,889
pretty cool. This is what every single high-end hotel bathroom looks like. Put carpet in the

1545
05:29:28,889 --> 05:29:36,009
bathroom now. No, I already did that before and I don't want to do that again. That sucks. Pretty

1546
05:29:36,009 --> 05:30:00,220
cool. Resident sleeper. Hey, wake up. Oh, cool. I guess. Real cool. I guess. What happened?

1547
05:30:00,220 --> 05:30:07,560
Windows in a bathroom. Yeah. I don't get that either. I don't know why they would ever be a

1548
05:30:07,560 --> 05:30:14,819
window in a bathroom, especially windows that are at somewhere around waist height on a first floor,

1549
05:30:14,819 --> 05:30:23,990
waist height. If those blinds are up and I look at like, just think about that. I think we've had

1550
05:30:23,990 --> 05:30:26,950
this exact conversation before, but there's a lot of potential new people here that I want to bring

1551
05:30:26,950 --> 05:30:33,580
this up to. If you're peeing right here and this window is right there, why would you ever want the

1552
05:30:33,580 --> 05:30:43,020
opportunity for like the paper boy to just drive by and look over or anybody literally doesn't matter

1553
05:30:43,020 --> 05:31:01,159
who? In fact, I'll go one step further. Every single blind in my entire place, doesn't matter

1554
05:31:01,159 --> 05:31:13,930
where I am, is permanently closed. You guys like that too? They're never open because I know one

1555
05:31:13,930 --> 05:31:18,729
day I'm going to like lock eyes with somebody outside of my window. There's going to be somebody

1556
05:31:18,729 --> 05:31:23,610
like just out there and we're going to lock fucking eyes and it's going to be like, oh shit.

1557
05:31:24,169 --> 05:31:32,869
Uh, okay, then get away. No, I, all blinds closed everywhere. No windows, no open windows ever.

1558
05:31:32,869 --> 05:31:54,360
Why is it kind of like this? That doesn't seem very healthy. Is it? I'm doing another funny

1559
05:31:54,360 --> 05:32:05,930
aquatine impression. I'm like getting out of here very soon. Social interaction. I'm sorry, but

1560
05:32:05,930 --> 05:32:12,090
walking eyes with a random person from your neighborhood or from like your outside of like

1561
05:32:12,650 --> 05:32:20,630
apartment complex. It's just odd. I don't want to do that. Who wants to do that? I don't want

1562
05:32:20,630 --> 05:32:25,990
people to see me like fun. Plus I'm naked all the time. Right? So when am I, why would I,

1563
05:32:25,990 --> 05:32:36,540
what opportunity would I ever have to have any windows open? I'm constantly without a shirt,

1564
05:32:36,540 --> 05:32:46,549
at least. So what opportunity are the windows ever going to be open? He's naked right now.

1565
05:32:46,549 --> 05:32:54,840
I actually am not. I have clothes on today. This music is way too intense for what we're doing.

1566
05:32:57,240 --> 05:33:09,450
Proof it. I actually, you know what? I actually can prove it. I can prove it. No, I can't. The

1567
05:33:09,450 --> 05:33:17,349
webcam is unplugged now. How? It doesn't make any sense. You saw me like four hours ago when

1568
05:33:17,349 --> 05:33:36,220
I turned on the webcam. What are you talking about? All right. Installations. Toilet. No,

1569
05:33:36,220 --> 05:33:50,709
this sink is, there you go. Okay. It looks good. Toilet. I feel like I keep hearing this music in

1570
05:33:50,709 --> 05:34:22,119
every Spider-Man movie. Okay. How about this one? Toilet standard. All right. Stick it on. On. I

1571
05:34:22,119 --> 05:34:27,080
have to go. I have to go. I gotta go. I'll pick up tomorrow. Don't worry. We'll pick up tomorrow.

1572
05:34:28,540 --> 05:34:40,119
Crossing that out, that mark where I have to, I have to get up. I gotta go. I gotta go. I will pick

1573
05:34:40,119 --> 05:34:45,479
this up exactly where we left it. And I'm going to be, we're going to make it happen. We're going to

1574
05:34:45,479 --> 05:34:51,500
do a whole mini golf course back here. And then I'm going to pretend to you guys that I'm going

1575
05:34:51,500 --> 05:34:56,619
to play Desperados 3 tomorrow, but four or five, six hours is going to go by tomorrow.

1576
05:34:57,349 --> 05:35:03,209
And I'm going to be like, oh shit, well, we'll do that later. The plan is to do this and then

1577
05:35:03,209 --> 05:35:07,799
play Desperados. And look, maybe we just play Desperados like a few days later, a couple days

1578
05:35:07,799 --> 05:35:18,040
later, whatever. Hey James, thanks for the 10 subs. Thank you, James. A lot of people are today.

1579
05:35:18,040 --> 05:35:28,069
Hope you enjoyed the stream. Thanks for stepping by. We'll see you tomorrow. Thanks guys. I missed

1580
05:35:28,069 --> 05:35:35,669
massive bits. Holy shit. I did. There's a hundred bucks, 10,000 bits from Stormy 2. Thank you for

1581
05:35:35,669 --> 05:35:42,680
the a hundred dollars. Is Pac-Man totally tubular or radical man? Totally tubular. Is it the very,

1582
05:35:42,680 --> 05:35:53,900
very simple question for me to answer, but thank you. That's a ton of money. And I don't, I know,

1583
05:35:53,900 --> 05:36:00,900
I, like I said, I don't read it's anymore, but people still decide it's a good idea to give me

1584
05:36:00,900 --> 05:36:09,540
fucking hundreds of dollars. And I just hope you think it's worth it. Thank you. I will see you

1585
05:36:09,540 --> 05:36:21,369
guys tomorrow. Good night. Goodbye. Have a wonderful rest of your day. Let's do the credits.

1586
05:36:21,369 --> 05:36:38,810
Oh, that's, that's Elmo. That's the picture of, why is that sea dead? He's not dead. He's just

1587
05:36:38,810 --> 05:36:51,689
sleeping. He sleeps on his stomach. This saves the game automatically. Yeah, it does. What music is

1588
05:36:51,689 --> 05:36:57,669
playing? All right. Pac-Man. I forgot. I thought, why did I think that was in House Flipper? All

1589
05:36:57,669 --> 05:37:08,069
right. Thanks everybody for subbing. Here they come. Just a moment. Yeah, there's a bunch of

1590
05:37:08,069 --> 05:37:14,389
other stuff that I have too. I want to do custom robo. I want to play ghosts of Tsushima too,

1591
05:37:14,389 --> 05:37:21,340
but I don't even know if I'm going to stream that. I have no idea. When I took off that couple of

1592
05:37:21,340 --> 05:37:29,930
months, I created a gigantic backlog of tons of things that I now need to figure out when they're

1593
05:37:29,930 --> 05:37:49,099
going to happen. But thanks a lot. It's broken again. And I even, I had, why is this doing this

1594
05:37:49,099 --> 05:38:05,860
again? I had it open. Did I, I did. I had, am I going to play Paper Mario? Yes, I will play.

1595
05:38:05,860 --> 05:38:14,470
I promise I'll play Paper Mario. Thanks big buddy. The only guy again, two subs and two streams.

1596
05:38:16,250 --> 05:38:23,430
We're on a roll. God damn it. All right. Well, I don't know why this is happening again.

1597
05:38:24,630 --> 05:38:37,930
Wasn't it open? I, by tomorrow, this is going to be fixed. If it ain't, then okay. If this is not

1598
05:38:37,930 --> 05:38:44,009
fixed tomorrow, if this doesn't work tomorrow, I want the stream after that to only be Jerma

1599
05:38:44,009 --> 05:38:57,669
punching emotes until I'm, I have to stop the stream. Okay. Bring the winks back. No, the winks,

1600
05:38:57,669 --> 05:39:03,880
I can't do the winks anymore, but I'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll pick up right where we left

1601
05:39:03,880 --> 05:39:11,700
off. Good night. Goodbye. Have a wonderful rest of your night. See you tomorrow. I had a great,

1602
05:39:12,340 --> 05:40:03,689
time. Abrupt ending. Everybody's saying raid, raid, raid, raid, raid. Uh, what do you, who's,

1603
05:40:03,689 --> 05:40:18,340
who's live right now? Raid Mr. Slime. That, that's me. Actually, that's me.

1604
05:40:31,259 --> 05:40:52,950
Raid a small account. You should, you want to, you want to raid Nyaners?

1605
05:40:58,869 --> 05:41:13,659
All right. Yes. Are you, all right. I, are you guys going to be nice?

1606
05:41:14,220 --> 05:41:34,569
Am I going to just diary you guys on a channel we've never been to before? Raid Rev. This is

1607
05:41:34,569 --> 05:41:48,659
going to be, this is going to be a toss-up. Raid GDQ. Oh, fuck. GDQ is going on. Oh my God. I know

1608
05:41:48,659 --> 05:41:57,080
I, I'm so happy about that. I love staying up till like fucking four in the morning and watching

1609
05:41:57,080 --> 05:42:14,279
people beat Nintendo games. Do them both. Raid Nyaners now or, or punch you. You guys better be

1610
05:42:14,279 --> 05:42:18,840
fucking nice. I swear to God, if I get word, if I get word back that you guys were fucking like

1611
05:42:18,840 --> 05:42:23,479
mean or fucked up, I'm going to, you're going to hear from me. You're going to be in big trouble.

1612
05:42:23,479 --> 05:42:38,500
You're going to be grounded. All right. We'll do that. And then I'm going to raid GDQ and then

1613
05:42:38,500 --> 05:42:43,459
I'm going to, can I even do that? Can we bounce around? I don't think you can even do that.

1614
05:42:51,509 --> 05:43:00,659
Let me see if I can do like a raid bounce. All right. Here we go. Be nice. Be nice. I don't,

1615
05:43:00,659 --> 05:43:05,060
I don't even know who this person is. Like, so I'm just, Hey, great. All right. Let's, let's go.

1616
05:43:05,060 --> 05:43:21,319
Fine. Here we go. You ready? I'm doing, I'm doing it. Don't raid bounce. We did that before

1617
05:43:21,319 --> 05:43:33,610
Joel and I ended up hosting the league of legends channel and I, I, I hosted the league of legends

1618
05:43:33,610 --> 05:43:46,040
channel for like fucking four straight days. All right. Here we go. Go say hello. Tell them about

1619
05:43:46,040 --> 05:44:09,659
my, my Mr. Slime stream. I'm not leaving this channel. All right. Goodbye. I'll see you tomorrow.
