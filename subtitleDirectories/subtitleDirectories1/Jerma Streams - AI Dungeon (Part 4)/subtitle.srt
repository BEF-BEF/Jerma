1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:10,660
You know something's funny that I've only really started to notice very very recently is before

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,170
stream starts I'm just you know I'm throwing some water in my face and maybe I brush my teeth I'm

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:25,339
taking Otto outside but when it strikes that exact moment of let's say 11 o'clock right I'm looking

4
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:31,899
outside and the fucking birds are chirping my dog is just what's this what's that over there

5
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:40,280
come on Otto let's go and there are thousands of people just screaming but I don't even hear them

6
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:49,289
it's very odd to think about that like I'm in the bathroom just doing a full piss

7
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,070
and it's just dead silent in my bathroom and in the back of my mind I'm just thinking there's a

8
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,170
like there's probably two or three thousand people right now just yelling at me and I'm just there

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:12,780
I'm just here I better get in there anyways hello I am yelling yeah but I don't hear you

10
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:22,819
it's weird like I'm just I'm just existing outside with Otto and like it is the sun

11
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:57,049
like where's the fucking stream give us a piss cam okay I don't want to just just I'm that's

12
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:08,919
I'll see you guys tomorrow the gas got out all right so today today was supposed to be chat's

13
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,229
choice I said that yeah yesterday very very plainly I was like oh today's gonna be your

14
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:21,699
viewer's choice he had a lot of trouble deciding I had to eliminate it was AI dungeon with the

15
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:32,150
dragon engine or eternal darkness and it was almost a straight 50 50 split on each pole so

16
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,349
what I've decided to do is I'm just gonna play AI dungeon for a little while I don't know once

17
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:46,099
I'm kind of like yeah that was fun I did buy the thing like the game apparently I don't know

18
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:52,900
anything about this I was told in the last AI dungeon stream that hey dude buy the new buy the

19
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,939
good one buy the one that has like actual it's like a better version it's a better engine it

20
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:04,300
has better AI training like I'm holy that's fucking all right let's go so I got it it's

21
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:13,620
currently active it apparently it does I've never done it before so that I mean why not give it a

22
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,620
try when I'm done with this or if I might be stuck here for four or five hours this might be the

23
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,340
stream but I intend on eventually maybe moving over to eternal darkness for the game cube that's

24
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:38,020
set up it's ready to go oh mega pog yeah easy lying again prove that I have eternal darkness

25
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,680
um no you'll see it in like a few hours if I have it or not so why don't you stick around why don't

26
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,849
you watch the stream then you want that answer maybe you'll get it but you gotta you've got to

27
00:03:49,849 --> 00:04:00,949
stick around and watch the whole thing how will you ever know scamming scamming view wait scam

28
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:10,650
all right let's get to this I have to put on some music though because uh streamers without music

29
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:25,819
are like singers without voices so I'm sorry I have to put on something why you question marks

30
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:35,000
are you talking about how am I getting question marks it means it means that you have to have music

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,079
if you're a streamer in the background if you're just doing like hit sitting around irl stuff

32
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:48,019
otherwise you can't you can't it's impossible it's and you can't do it I tried who the fuck said

33
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:59,370
Lisa the painful ost I didn't all right I'm about to okay what is 100 gecks just what is it I don't

39
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:10,790
the question is did you like it I don't know the answer is no but whatever I'm I'm like 35

40
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:22,540
I listen my music I listen to is like Lost Odyssey theme song like the first two Gorillaz albums

41
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,660

47
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:17,610
and I'm like this is my favorite song ever I'm glad I can hear it every single day I love it

48
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:26,860
when it just when it takes over the Christmas songs too during Christmas time you'll hear like

52
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:01,589
here's my opinion on it I don't understand I don't I like okay it's cool like I maybe

53
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:13,910
I was young before like whatever what do you want me to say I'm 35 what are we able to say

54
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:27,560
what I hate it it's a stupid song it is for stupid idiots I just I don't care I don't care

55
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:37,000
enough to tell you that all right so let's put on Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars

56
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:53,669
that's my kind of music you know I only I listen to video okay tell them ask me if I'm weird

57
00:08:53,669 --> 00:09:04,059
go ahead I listen to video game soundtracks more than I do actual like music on the radio

58
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:13,029
I will tell you though that I do listen to to to solo all the time bryden solo I listen to it all

59
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,190
the time that's a great song like it's a really catchy song I don't care if you think that that's

60
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,980
like stupid that's that's like a book and it's one of the most catchiest songs I've ever heard in my

61
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,320
life so I'm sorry I listen to that sometimes and of course I listen to freddy dread too

62
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:39,429
freddy dreads music and I'm just saying that because he just gave 50 community subs that's

63
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:52,519
a fucking ton though dude you all right you are you drop huge money all the time that's

64
00:09:52,519 --> 00:10:05,940
a pogchamp moment freddy dread is a is a musician uh when you would call I guess you'd call a rapper

65
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:12,820
he does like rap I've heard oh I have you never oh well Jeremy you have no idea uh hey freddy um

66
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:29,500
you don't think I know you don't think I've heard any of his music before stalling this is it's been

67
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:44,779
12 minutes fuck that is a long time oh go I'm trying to get my ost on here look okay I can

71
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:16,700

72
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:33,259

75
00:11:50,100 --> 00:12:05,110
uh Ralph generating you are Ralph a patient living in Chicago you have a hospital bracelet

76
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,149
and a pack of bandages you wake up in an old rundown hospital with no memory of how you got

77
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:17,720
there I'm a patient living in Chicago am I in the I'm in I live in the hospital take a look

78
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,899
around the room and see three doors one door has a physician's office sign above it another has an

79
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:35,720
x-ray sign above it and the last says exit I go to the x-ray machine okay go what do you do

80
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:54,440
go to the x-ray door go to the x-ray door go to the x-ray door just go to x-ray door how smart is

81
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:05,740
this hold on what is this I'm actually very concerned about your health after watching

82
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,580
you just brought a spree vod when I had the time regularly eating large spoonfuls of peanut butter

83
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,419
will upset balance of omega-6 to omega-3 ratio the majority of nuts especially peanut butter

84
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,659
which is concentrated contains very high amounts of omega-6 which is the unhealthy oil you want to

85
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,580
lower is similar to eating large tablespoons of canola or vegetable oil which causes severe

86
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:29,850
inflammation in your body and upsets gut bacteria I eat tuna and salmon like four days a week dude

87
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:42,389
well my omegas are my omega lulls are going to be just fine now he's going to have all this

88
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:50,970
mercury all right go to the x-ray door go to the x-ray door you go through the door to your right

89
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:58,019
and find another hallway you see signs for x-ray radiology and outpatient lab this is a lot smarter

90
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:06,299
already I can already tell all right go to x-ray should I just like go in the x-ray machine

91
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:18,950
okay go to x-ray go get superpowers you go down the hall and through the door to your right you

92
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,070
see the staff break area and a series of doors one says administration another says consultation

93
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,669
another says x-ray how many so I went into one door this is x-ray and I get another group of

94
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:35,720
doors and they had one of them of another next set of doors has x-ray on it is this even a hospital

95
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:50,980
or is this like a seinfeld set okay go to the x-ray machine thinking thinking you make your way

96
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,860
through the door to your left and find yourself in an old dark x-ray room you see an envelope taped

97
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:17,740
to the machine with your name on it does it even work turn on the x-ray machine you turn on the

420
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:54,020
slowly you allow your eyes to follow hers and you see it what do we see it's a flying fortress with

421
01:19:54,020 --> 01:20:01,960
an emblem that you are all too familiar with painted on the side the griffin with a shriek

422
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:19,609
the woman leaps into action i've never heard of the griffin in my life follow her griffin ai

427
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:13,739
rough action figure okay you head towards the griffin as you approach the griffin you notice

428
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:18,840
something is coming out of it out of the hundreds of cannons on the side of the griffin

429
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:26,119
a single bullet comes flying out flying straight towards the woman dive in front of the bullet

430

pretend to dive in front of the bullet how do you pretend to dive in front of something

431
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:09,579
it's a hologram you pretend to dive in front of the bullet as the bullet hits you you fall

432
01:22:09,579 --> 01:22:13,579
backwards the weight of the arrow knocking you off your feet and sending you to the ground

433
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:28,600
you hit the ground and look up at the massive flying fortress okay i'd be real pissed now

434
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:34,659
shit i really didn't think i was gonna get hit by that i did like a half-assed dive and i like

by the bullet because i had an arrow in my pocket and i landed on the ground and put picked up the

440
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:24,100
arrow and held it in front of my chest hoping that people would think it was an arrow and not a

01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:34,119
bullet so i think i did okay all right you stand up to begin to walk towards the griffin directly

gunshots not too far away from your current position

464
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:34,060
The mountain is steep, and you're in no mood to fall off.

465
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:54,539
Yodel-ee, yodel-oh, yodel-la, yodel-ee, yodel-ee, yodel-oh, yodel-ay, yodel-lee.

466
01:27:54,539 --> 01:28:05,460
You can't write L-U-L and then minus two.

467
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:09,180
You say yodel-ee, yodel-oh, yodel-ay, yodel-yodel-lee.

468
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:19,260
You shuffle your feet along the mountain, trying to make it as little noise as possible.

469
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,539
Bullets fly past you.

470
01:28:20,539 --> 01:28:21,659
You keep climbing.

471
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:23,479
Suddenly you hear a yelp.

472
01:28:23,479 --> 01:28:40,270
Okay, so this is what is happening right now.

473
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:43,239
Uh-uh.

474
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:49,390

475
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:50,390
Not enough of them.

476
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:56,750
I'm climbing.

477
01:28:56,750 --> 01:29:00,359
Yelp.

478
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:03,260
I, nope.

479
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:04,260
Hey!

480
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,699
That was, hey!

481
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:06,699
Add an echo.

482
01:29:06,699 --> 01:29:07,699
Fucking god damn it.

483
01:29:07,699 --> 01:29:08,699
Don't make me do this.

484
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:30,949
Why is this doing this?

485
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:31,949
You see?

486
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:33,829
Wait, hold on.

487
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:34,829
What?

488
01:29:34,829 --> 01:29:38,850
Okay, there we go.

489
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:57,460
That doesn't sound right.

490
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,460
That doesn't sound right.

491
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,460
Why does it sound so weird?

492
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:30,560
Where are all the voice robots?

493
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,119
Oh shit, the hardtune's not on.

494
01:30:34,119 --> 01:30:35,119
Is it?

495
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,770
Oh fuck!

496
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:40,770
There we go.

497
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:41,770
Oh shit!

498
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,770
Everybody knows I'm a fraud!

499
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:52,100
Fuck.

500
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,100
Everyone's going to hate me now.

501
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,460
Everyone's going to leave.

502
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,460
My big secret.

503
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:57,859
Let's go back to what we were doing.

504
01:30:57,859 --> 01:30:59,029
Yeah, we were doing this.

505
01:30:59,029 --> 01:31:00,029
He's going to bleed viewers now.

506
01:31:00,029 --> 01:31:04,340
Chop.

507
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,840
Okay.

508
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,039
Suddenly you hear a yelp.

509
01:31:08,039 --> 01:31:09,039
Why are these?

510
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:13,739
I need to turn this off.

511
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:14,739
Could you hear this shit?

512
01:31:14,739 --> 01:31:15,739
I wanted like a bunch of them.

513
01:31:15,739 --> 01:31:16,739
Okay, here we go.

514
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:18,550
I need ice music.

515
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:23,920
I don't know what ice music is, but this is the first thing I'm clicking on.

516
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:45,630
Oh, he's playing ice cubes for music.

517
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:47,630
That's actually fucking awesome.

518
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:51,789
Okay, one hour of ice music.

519
01:31:51,789 --> 01:31:54,760
Here we go.

520
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,020
You hear a yelp.

521
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:59,989
Who's there?

522
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:00,989
Who's there?

523
01:32:00,989 --> 01:32:12,859
Jacob.

524
01:32:12,859 --> 01:32:14,670
Is that you?

525
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:15,670
Yeah.

526
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:19,670
You see his face and he screams.

527
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:21,670
He seems to be in a state of shock.

528
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:26,199
What are you doing here?

529
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:33,840
Same thing.

530
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,840
You know what I mean?

531
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:45,550
I could ask you the same thing.

532
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:46,550
I don't know.

533
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:48,550
You see him stand up and he looks at you.

534
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:52,550
He doesn't seem to be wearing any clothes, but he doesn't seem cold.

535
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:59,899
Am I dead?

536
01:32:59,899 --> 01:33:00,899
Whoa.

537
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:10,199
I would be like, whoa.

538
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:11,199
What?

539
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:12,199
You're dead.

540
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:13,199
I'm dead.

541
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,199
He looks down at his hands, begins shaking.

542
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,380
Then he looks up at you.

543
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:18,380
We're dead.

544
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:19,380
You nod slowly.

545
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:26,569
Help me up.

546
01:33:26,569 --> 01:33:32,300
Aren't I hanging off the side of the mountain?

547
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:38,060
Grab his hand to help pull him up.

548
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:40,750
As soon as he stands, he begins to wobble.

549
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,750
He falls to the ground.

550
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:43,750
He realizes that his legs are broken.

551
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:52,819
Carry Jacob to the top of the mountain.

552
01:33:52,819 --> 01:34:00,760
Put him out of his misery.

553
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,760
What?

554
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:15,100
Carry...

555
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,100
Okay, you stand up and walk over to Jacob.

556
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:20,100
He's sitting in a puddle of his own blood.

557
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:23,100
Help!

558
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:34,420
You grab him under the arms and begin dragging him up the mountain.

559
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,420
Get to the top.

560
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:41,590
How's AI doing?

561
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:50,130
Lie down next to him.

562
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:53,130
You laugh and then begin to cry.

563
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:54,130
What do we do now?

564
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:55,130
He asks.

565
01:34:55,130 --> 01:35:00,399
You begin laughing again.

566
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:01,399
Competitive.

567
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:02,399
It's been pretty good.

568
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:03,399
It's been pretty good.

569
01:35:03,399 --> 01:35:08,310
It's been fun.

570
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:10,939
Start laughing harder.

571
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:14,260
We can't believe it.

572
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:17,260
We made it to the top, but it's hysterical because we're both so fucked up.

573
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:18,260
This is crazy.

574
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,260
Might as well just laugh.

575
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:20,260
What else can we do?

576
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:27,189
You roll around in the snow laughing at nothing for no reason.

577
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:29,189
Why are you laughing?

578
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:32,890
Stop laughing and look at him.

579
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:33,890
Point and laugh.

580
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:42,100
You point and laugh.

581
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,100
You begin laughing again and you point at him.

582
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:48,100
You look at the trees and begin to laugh at the trees.

583
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:49,100
He gets up and...

584
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:58,220
I can't...

585
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:01,220
He gets up and begins running in circles.

586
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:08,130
I just pictured him as a dog.

587
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:09,130
Like, is he a dog?

588
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:23,869
Let's let the AI take care of this one for a little while.

589
01:36:23,869 --> 01:36:24,869
I don't understand.

590
01:36:24,869 --> 01:36:25,869
He says.

591
01:36:25,869 --> 01:36:26,869
You begin laughing again.

592
01:36:26,869 --> 01:36:28,869
Suddenly you hear a loud noise.

593
01:36:28,869 --> 01:36:35,460
It's the sound of a gun.

594
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:36,460
They stop moving.

595
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:40,520
Hide.

596
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,079
No.

597
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:49,310
Hide behind that shed.

598
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:54,729
Hide behind that glacier.

599
01:36:54,729 --> 01:36:55,729
Hide behind that quick.

600
01:36:55,729 --> 01:37:04,619
Hide behind that glacier.

601
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:06,619
Wrap him and quickly make your way over to the glacier.

602
01:37:06,619 --> 01:37:08,619
You both duck down behind it.

603
01:37:08,619 --> 01:37:09,619
Are they gone?

604
01:37:09,619 --> 01:37:11,119
I don't know.

605
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:20,399
You should peek.

606
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:28,630
You should peek around the corner, Jacob.

607
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:32,750
Hello?

608
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:38,579
Jacob slowly peeks around the corner of the mountain.

609
01:37:38,579 --> 01:37:40,579
He immediately ducks back down.

610
01:37:40,579 --> 01:37:42,579
They're still there.

611
01:37:42,579 --> 01:37:43,579
Are they looking this way?

612
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:44,579
You ask.

613
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:49,140
No.

614
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:59,949
Say, Jacob, go run out there and wave your arms in the air screaming.

615
01:37:59,949 --> 01:38:22,420
Say, Jacob, go run out there and wave your arms in the air screaming.

616
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,720
What?

617
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,720
Jacob says.

618
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,720
Go ahead.

619
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,720
Jacob slowly stands up.

620
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,720
He begins walking to the direction of the fortress.

621
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,960
What's going on?

622
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:40,789
What color is the fortress?

623
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:42,789
How big is the fortress?

624
01:38:42,789 --> 01:38:45,789
How big is the fortress?

625
01:38:45,789 --> 01:38:56,760
AI doesn't know.

626
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:57,760
Okay.

627
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,760
AI doesn't know what's going on.

628
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,340
What's going on?

629
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:04,859
Let's go.

630
01:39:04,859 --> 01:39:09,659
Sacrifice Jacob.

631
01:39:09,659 --> 01:39:14,359
Here we go.

632
01:39:14,359 --> 01:39:16,109
Let's go.

633
01:39:16,109 --> 01:39:19,109
You stand up and begin running towards the fortress.

634
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:22,109
Once you get there, you hear a loud bang and everything turns black.

635
01:39:22,109 --> 01:39:55,920
You wipe the cartoon black smoke off your face and keep running.

636
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,220
You rush into the fortress, guns blazing.

637
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:01,220
You go up to the first guard that you see and you stab him through the neck.

638
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,460
You run up to the next and do the same.

639
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:04,460
Why am I doing this?

640
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:08,779
Look for Jacob.

641
01:40:08,779 --> 01:40:09,779
It's okay.

642
01:40:09,779 --> 01:40:21,680
It's just a cartoon knife.

643
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:28,140
Outright violence.

644
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:29,140
You look for Jacob.

645
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:30,140
Well, where is he?

646
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:31,140
Come on.

647
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,140
Where's Jacob?

648
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:44,680
You look around and see Jacob on the floor, his face covered in soot and blood.

649
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,680
Jacob, you say.

650
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:48,680
He slowly turns his head to face you.

651
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:59,979
It was Looney Tunes soot.

652
01:40:59,979 --> 01:41:10,060
Already did that joke.

653
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:11,060
Not to somebody else.

654
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:14,510
You wipe the soot and blood off his face.

655
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:16,510
He slowly opens his eyes, revealing his sad eyes.

656
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:18,510
Am I dead?

657
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:19,510
Yes, you reply.

658
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:20,510
Really?

659
01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:29,560
Yes.

660
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,800
Really.

661
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,770
He's dead.

662
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:35,770
Why does everybody ask if they die?

663
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:37,770
Everybody asks if they're dead.

664
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:44,449
Say yes, really.

665
01:41:44,449 --> 01:41:46,449
Really, you reply.

666
01:41:46,449 --> 01:41:48,880
You hear a scream.

667
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:49,880
It's Ethel.

668
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,880
He slowly begins to rise.

669
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,880
I'm so scared.

670
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:54,880
He yells.

671
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,880
Now you begin to rise, too.

672
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:07,300
Grab the table.

673
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:09,300
Grab and hold the table.

674
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:11,300
I don't float anymore.

675
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:21,539
Table's not going to come up with me, right?

676
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:30,430
Is Ethel the hologram?

677
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:33,529
Maybe.

678
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:39,930
Oh, yeah, right.

679
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:41,869
Grab and hold the table.

680
01:42:41,869 --> 01:42:43,869
Your hands go through the table.

681
01:42:43,869 --> 01:42:48,869
The rest of your body slowly follows until you completely rise out of your chair and into the air.

682
01:42:48,869 --> 01:42:55,680
All right, keep going.

683
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:56,680
What else you got?

684
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:04,100
What's going on, you ask?

685
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:07,470
I think this is heaven, Ethel says.

686
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:09,470
Oh, you reply.

687
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:13,100
The walls begin to turn into a bright white light.

688
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:20,350
I have a question for God.

689
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:35,939
You begin floating towards the light, as does Jacob.

690
01:43:35,939 --> 01:43:38,439
What are you doing, Jacob?

691
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:40,439
I don't know, he says.

692
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:43,439
Jacob begins levitating towards the white light.

693
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:51,020
Float into the light.

694
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:55,239
Jacob belongs in hell?

695
01:43:55,239 --> 01:43:58,239
Should I push Jacob down?

696
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:00,439
Float into the light.

697
01:44:00,439 --> 01:44:03,439
Once inside, you see a man in white robe sitting on a chair.

698
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:05,439
Hello and welcome.

699
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:09,439
I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, he says.

700
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:16,970
Can I ask you a question?

701
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:27,590
Can I ask you a question?

702
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:30,220
Of course, Jesus replies.

703
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:33,840
What did you really think of the world?

704
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:39,189
I loved it, he replies.

705
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:47,770
What happens when you die, Jesus?

706
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:56,579
You get to come to heaven, he says, smiling.

707
01:44:56,579 --> 01:44:58,069
Forever?

708
01:44:58,069 --> 01:44:59,250
Forever.

709
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:01,489
Jacob and Ethel both nod in agreement.

710
01:45:01,489 --> 01:45:03,489
That sounds great.

711
01:45:03,489 --> 01:45:36,689
Say, do you care that I had six marriages and only eight ground beef my entire life?

712
01:45:36,689 --> 01:45:40,699
No, no, no, we're going to stick with this one.

713
01:45:40,699 --> 01:45:43,699
I've just lived such a meat-filled life.

714
01:45:44,699 --> 01:45:55,619
Do you care that I had six marriages?

715
01:45:55,619 --> 01:45:58,350
That many?

716
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:00,350
I guess that's a lot.

717
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:02,350
Don't worry about it.

718
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:09,479
It's okay.

719
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:11,979
Don't worry about it.

720
01:46:11,979 --> 01:46:12,979
It's okay.

721
01:46:12,979 --> 01:46:41,710
Wait, do you care that all those marriages were me cheating on all of my wives?

722
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:44,020
That's what was sin, right?

723
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:45,020
We got gluttony?

724
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:47,020
All I ate was ground beef.

725
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:48,020
No, we didn't do gluttony.

726
01:46:48,020 --> 01:47:02,439
We didn't do gluttony.

727
01:47:02,439 --> 01:47:05,439
Do you mind that I only ate ground beef until I got big and fat?

728
01:47:05,439 --> 01:47:24,939
Do you mind that I only ate ground beef until I got big and fat?

729
01:47:24,939 --> 01:47:27,430
That's fine, too.

730
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:30,439
Jacob, do you have any more questions?

731
01:47:30,439 --> 01:47:33,060
Jacob shakes his head.

732
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,060
I don't think so.

733
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:37,560
Come on, let's go.

734
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:44,579
Okay, lost.

735
01:47:44,579 --> 01:47:50,220
I only care about money.

736
01:47:50,220 --> 01:48:04,189
You, Jacob, and Ethel rise up into the sky.

737
01:48:04,189 --> 01:48:06,189
Well, that's it for this chapter.

738
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:07,189
Thanks for reading.

739
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:09,970
All right, close the book.

740
01:48:09,970 --> 01:48:11,970
Where the fuck am I?

741
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:14,869
Where am I?

742
01:48:14,869 --> 01:48:18,289
Close the book.

743
01:48:18,289 --> 01:48:20,659
This was just a movie stream.

744
01:48:20,659 --> 01:48:25,390
Played out the exact same way.

745
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:34,979
Okay, let's do another one.

746
01:48:34,979 --> 01:48:44,260
How about zombies?

747
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:48,670
Do fantasy?

748
01:48:48,670 --> 01:48:50,670
Let's do fantasy.

749
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:56,619
Noble Princess Knight, Wizard, Witch, Ranger, Squire, Peasant.

750
01:48:56,619 --> 01:48:57,619
Let's be a peasant.

751
01:48:57,619 --> 01:48:58,619
Peasant.

752
01:48:58,619 --> 01:49:04,270
What's a good peasant name?

753
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:08,260
Jacob.

754
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:12,960
Jacob.

755
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:18,500
Are we going to continue Jacob's story here?

756
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,640
Schwab?

757
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:25,779
Here we go.

758
01:49:25,779 --> 01:49:33,300
Okay, you are Jacob.

759
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:38,420
Let me get some music.

760
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:47,430
Okay, you are Jacob, a peasant living in a small village in the kingdom of Larian.

761
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:49,430
You have a pitchfork and nothing else.

762
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:52,430
You dream of getting out of your village and having an adventure.

763
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:55,430
You go to your fields and begin working.

764
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:57,430
You look up and see your friend Anthony there.

765
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:59,630
Hey, Jacob.

766
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:02,630
You'll never guess what I heard in the tavern last night.

767
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:03,630
He says to you.

768
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:04,869
I don't know.

769
01:50:04,869 --> 01:50:05,869
What?

770
01:50:05,869 --> 01:50:07,880
Okay.

771
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:09,880
I can't add anything there.

772
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:18,050
There's a dragon to the south of here, like a real dragon.

773
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:20,050
Not a wyvern or a drake.

774
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:23,050
It's been terrorizing the nearby villages.

775
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:25,699
Really?

776
01:50:25,699 --> 01:50:37,840
Hey, that's horrible.

777
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:44,239
Same voice, new effects.

778
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:45,239
Omega Low.

779
01:50:45,239 --> 01:50:46,239
Get that guy out of here.

780
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,239
Ban that guy for like a year.

781
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:51,250
That's horrible.

782
01:50:51,250 --> 01:51:00,210
Yeah, I know, Anthony.

783
01:51:00,210 --> 01:51:01,210
Yeah, I know.

784
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:03,210
I wish I had the courage to go fight it.

785
01:51:03,210 --> 01:51:06,470
What if it kills you?

786
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:10,710
A valiant death is preferable to a life of cowardice.

787
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:20,850
Do you want to go get to the bar?

788
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:23,850
Do you want to go to the inn?

789
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:25,470
Talk about it.

790
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:28,470
Look, I'm not just going to climb the ice fountain again.

791
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:30,470
You want to go to the inn?

792
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:32,470
You want to go to the inn?

793
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:41,619
Sure, says Anthony.

794
01:51:41,619 --> 01:51:43,619
At the inn, you and Anthony have a few drinks.

795
01:51:43,619 --> 01:51:47,359
Hey.

796
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:48,659
Damn.

797
01:51:48,659 --> 01:51:50,970
I can't stop fucking thinking about this dragon.

798
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:51,970
This dragon, this dragon.

799
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:53,970
Since you brought it up, I can't fucking stop thinking about it.

800
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:55,340
Do we go get him?

801
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:56,340
I don't know.

802
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:57,340
Should I do it?

803
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:06,300
I can't stop thinking about that dragon.

804
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:13,939
Duncan Dragon.

805
01:52:13,939 --> 01:52:17,880
Aw, don't worry about it, says Anthony.

806
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:22,460
Would you ever want...

807
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:24,460
Let's go see the wizard tomorrow.

808
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:31,119
Maybe he can help us.

809
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:42,449
Let's go see the wizard tomorrow.

810
01:52:42,449 --> 01:52:43,449
Maybe he can help us.

811
01:52:43,449 --> 01:52:46,449
Sure, why not, says Anthony.

812
01:52:46,449 --> 01:52:49,739
Okay, bye.

813
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:51,739
You're like everybody that gets on the phone

814
01:52:51,739 --> 01:52:53,739
and doesn't know how to say goodbye on the phone,

815
01:52:53,739 --> 01:52:57,739
so you just kind of agree with or repeat everything I say

816
01:52:57,739 --> 01:53:01,739
until one of us finally is like, I fucking have to leave.

817
01:53:01,739 --> 01:53:13,140
Wave goodbye to Anthony.

818
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:22,890
Bye, Jacob.

819
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:25,319
Wave goodbye to your friend and head home.

820
01:53:25,319 --> 01:53:26,319
There we are.

821
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:27,319
Okay, good.

822
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:37,970
We don't go see the wizard.

823
01:53:40,359 --> 01:53:43,359
I'm just a regular guy in a kingdom.

824
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:44,859
That's it.

825
01:53:44,859 --> 01:53:45,859
This is...

826
01:53:45,859 --> 01:53:47,859
Oh, we're in a medieval fantasy fucking land.

827
01:53:47,859 --> 01:53:48,859
This guy didn't have any powers.

828
01:53:48,859 --> 01:53:50,859
He's just a regular guy.

829
01:53:50,859 --> 01:53:53,479
There's no cool thing that happens.

830
01:53:53,479 --> 01:53:55,039
Let's go over it.

831
01:53:55,039 --> 01:53:58,819
Oh no, there's a dragon.

832
01:53:58,819 --> 01:54:00,819
There's a dragon south of here, a real one.

833
01:54:00,819 --> 01:54:02,819
Wow, I can't believe it.

834
01:54:02,819 --> 01:54:03,819
That's horrible.

835
01:54:03,819 --> 01:54:04,819
Yeah, I know.

836
01:54:04,819 --> 01:54:06,819
Wish I had the courage to fight it.

837
01:54:06,819 --> 01:54:07,819
I know, what if it kills you?

838
01:54:07,819 --> 01:54:08,819
I have nothing.

839
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:10,819
I have no fucking weapons and no powers or anything.

840
01:54:10,819 --> 01:54:12,819
I'm just a guy that works on the farm.

841
01:54:12,819 --> 01:54:14,989
Yeah, valiant death.

842
01:54:14,989 --> 01:54:15,989
You want to go to the inn?

843
01:54:15,989 --> 01:54:16,989
Sure.

844
01:54:16,989 --> 01:54:18,989
Okay, let's have some drinks.

845
01:54:18,989 --> 01:54:20,989
I can't stop thinking about that dragon.

846
01:54:20,989 --> 01:54:21,989
Yeah, I know.

847
01:54:21,989 --> 01:54:22,989
Don't worry about it.

848
01:54:22,989 --> 01:54:23,989
Maybe we should see the wizard tomorrow.

849
01:54:23,989 --> 01:54:24,989
He can help us.

850
01:54:24,989 --> 01:54:25,989
Yeah, sure.

851
01:54:25,989 --> 01:54:26,989
Okay, bye.

852
01:54:26,989 --> 01:54:29,489
I'll ask the wizard to go do the quest.

853
01:54:29,489 --> 01:54:34,670
Never did this say I had anything.

854
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:37,670
Like I had some major adventure to do.

855
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:39,670
I said I want to.

856
01:54:39,670 --> 01:54:42,670
I dream of getting out and having...

857
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:44,670
But that's not...

858
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:46,670
I live in reality right now.

859
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:50,020
I'm the wizard.

860
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:57,100
Of course, I have dreams of being an adventurer.

861
01:54:57,100 --> 01:55:01,050
But the wizard has the powers.

862
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:10,460
Forever an NPC.

863
01:55:13,979 --> 01:55:21,409
In fact, that was NPC underscore 118

864
01:55:21,409 --> 01:55:26,350
talking to NPC underscore 119.

865
01:55:26,350 --> 01:55:30,899
When you walk into the inn as a fucking Skyrim character.

866
01:55:30,899 --> 01:55:35,949
That's all that was.

867
01:55:35,949 --> 01:55:41,750
Man, this dragon, I can't believe it.

868
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:42,750
Neither can I.

869
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:44,750
I wish one day we could get rid of that dragon.

870
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:45,750
Yeah.

871
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:47,750
We should maybe go see the wizard.

872
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:48,750
Yeah.

873
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,930
Don't you think that's a great idea?

874
01:55:50,930 --> 01:55:51,930
Sure.

875
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:57,180
I'm not going to get NPC'd here.

876
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:01,119
I am a ranger.

877
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:04,000
Is this copyright music?

878
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,069
Oh, fuck.

879
01:56:06,069 --> 01:56:07,069
All right.

880
01:56:07,069 --> 01:56:15,609
Be a wizard.

881
01:56:15,609 --> 01:56:16,609
I do a wizard every time.

882
01:56:16,609 --> 01:56:20,609
I have to do at least one non-wizard gameplay.

883
01:56:20,609 --> 01:56:21,609
I'll do ranger.

884
01:56:21,609 --> 01:56:25,699
Yes, that is the way to say it.

885
01:56:25,699 --> 01:56:27,329
It's not ranger.

886
01:56:27,329 --> 01:56:29,329
It's ranger.

887
01:56:29,329 --> 01:56:31,720
All right.

888
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:32,720
What's a good OST?

889
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:33,720
No, no.

890
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:39,579
That's got to be like royalty-free jazz.

891
01:56:39,579 --> 01:56:41,659
No, that doesn't make sense.

892
01:56:41,659 --> 01:56:44,960
Royalty-free choir.

893
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,699
Emotional choir.

894
01:56:48,699 --> 01:56:49,699
No.

895
01:56:49,699 --> 01:56:52,699
Godhand OST.

896
01:56:52,699 --> 01:56:57,119
Is this any good?

897
01:56:57,119 --> 01:57:00,279
Not too arcadey.

898
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:01,279
Too arcadey.

899
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:02,279
Celeste.

900
01:57:02,279 --> 01:57:03,779
Oh, yeah.

901
01:57:03,779 --> 01:57:04,779
That's a good one.

902
01:57:04,779 --> 01:57:11,069
Okay.

903
01:57:11,069 --> 01:57:16,600
Here we go.

904
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,600
Nintendo Labo.

905
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:20,699
What's your character's name?

906
01:57:20,699 --> 01:57:23,600
I'm a ranger.

907
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:26,250
Von Darlo.

908
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:30,619
Real Ralph?

909
01:57:30,619 --> 01:57:31,619
No.

910
01:57:31,619 --> 01:57:35,229
Real Ruff.

911
01:57:35,229 --> 01:57:40,760
Real Tough.

912
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:41,760
What was the guy's name?

913
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,760
Slop.

914
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:43,760
I'm not going to even.

915
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:44,760
No, no.

916
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:47,979
Okay.

917
01:57:47,979 --> 01:57:48,979
Doug is okay.

918
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:49,979
How about Doug?

919
01:57:49,979 --> 01:57:50,979
Doug Shlop.

920
01:57:50,979 --> 01:57:52,800
That's such a shitty ranger name.

921
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:53,800
You are Doug Shlop.

922
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:59,520
A ranger.

923
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,520
A ranger.

924
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:01,520
A ranger.

925
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:06,659
A ranger.

926
01:58:06,659 --> 01:58:07,659
A ranger.

927
01:58:07,659 --> 01:58:08,659
A ranger.

928
01:58:08,659 --> 01:58:11,340
A ranger living in the Kingdom of Larian.

929
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:14,659
You have a hunting bow and a quiver of arrows.

930
01:58:14,659 --> 01:58:17,819
You've been searching for a mystical beast for three months, tracking it through the

931
01:58:17,819 --> 01:58:19,100
forest.

932
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,300
As you crouch behind a clump of trees, you see it.

933
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:27,649
It is a large black cat with a long tail that stands on its hind legs and looks like a man,

934
01:58:27,649 --> 01:58:29,609
but with fur all over its body.

935
01:58:29,609 --> 01:58:44,770
You just immediately shoot it with the arrow?

936
01:58:44,770 --> 01:58:47,500
First of all, that's what I'm hunting.

937
01:58:48,729 --> 01:58:53,550
I'm going to look at my map.

938
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:54,550
I need to see.

939
01:58:54,550 --> 01:59:02,789
You look at your map and see where you are and you make a note of it.

940
01:59:02,789 --> 01:59:04,789
You then look for potential escape routes.

941
01:59:04,789 --> 01:59:12,710
Which way would you run?

942
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:13,949
That's cat.

943
01:59:13,949 --> 01:59:15,260
Look at the cat.

944
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:16,260
Look at the cat's food.

945
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:17,500
I don't know.

946
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:19,819
What is it eating?

947
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:20,819
Does it eat?

948
01:59:20,819 --> 01:59:21,819
Is it a vegetarian?

949
01:59:21,819 --> 01:59:22,819
Is it a herbivore?

950
01:59:22,819 --> 01:59:23,819
A carnivore?

951
01:59:23,819 --> 01:59:27,689
You look at the dead deer on the ground.

952
01:59:27,689 --> 01:59:28,689
Thank you.

953
01:59:28,689 --> 01:59:29,689
The cat?

954
01:59:29,689 --> 01:59:30,689
A panther.

955
01:59:30,689 --> 01:59:32,050
Has two more just like it besides the corpse.

956
01:59:38,189 --> 01:59:39,189
Let's try this one.

957
01:59:39,189 --> 01:59:58,260
You ask if you can share some of the deer.

958
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:01,699
You slowly put your bow down and raise your hands.

959
02:00:01,699 --> 02:00:05,779
You slowly approach the deer carcasses and the panther does not move.

960
02:00:05,779 --> 02:00:09,060
Easy.

961
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:10,560
Easy.

962
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,119
Easy.

963
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:25,359
You say easy, putty tat.

964
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:30,710
Which is a reference to the popular movie Dead.

965
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:32,829
Walk towards the deer and the panther does not move.

966
02:00:32,829 --> 02:00:38,289
Is that a reference to Dead?

967
02:00:38,289 --> 02:00:42,279
Okay.

968
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:45,119
I'm close enough now.

969
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:57,949
Do you mind if I sit down?

970
02:00:57,949 --> 02:00:58,949
Popular movie Dead.

971
02:00:58,949 --> 02:01:01,739
Do you mind if I sit down?

972
02:01:01,739 --> 02:01:03,500
The panther stares at you silently.

973
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,220
You sit down and take a rest for a minute.

974
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:18,430
You say, I can't believe I've been out here three days.

975
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:38,100
It's been three months.

976
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:42,180
I've lost my mind.

977
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:45,670
Wow, I can't believe it.

978
02:01:45,710 --> 02:01:50,399
It's not been that long, but holy shit, three days is a long darn time.

979
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:51,399
Three fucking months.

980
02:01:51,399 --> 02:01:53,979
Okay.

981
02:01:53,979 --> 02:01:55,979
I can't believe I've been out here for three days.

982
02:01:55,979 --> 02:01:57,779
The panther continues to make no reaction.

983
02:01:57,779 --> 02:02:01,470
You begin to feel tired and lay down next to the panther.

984
02:02:01,470 --> 02:02:27,909
We're lying down looking up at the sky.

985
02:02:27,909 --> 02:02:34,739
You know, I always thought the stars were just big lightning bolts from other planets.

986
02:02:34,739 --> 02:02:35,739
So stupid.

987
02:02:35,739 --> 02:02:43,890
So young.

988
02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:53,880
The panther begins to slowly move towards you and sniffs your neck.

989
02:02:59,289 --> 02:03:01,289
I was just a big dumb idiot.

990
02:03:01,289 --> 02:03:22,079
I mean, I was just a big dumb idiot kid trying to make sense of the world.

991
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:48,689
The panther suddenly leaps on you and tears your throat out.

992
02:03:48,689 --> 02:03:51,289
I went out here on an expedition and got delirious in three months.

993
02:03:51,289 --> 02:03:55,189
Started talking to a cat.

994
02:03:55,189 --> 02:03:59,970
Like it was going to talk back.

995
02:03:59,970 --> 02:04:04,130
Oh, good work, Doug Shlopp.

996
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:05,130
Excellent.

997
02:04:05,130 --> 02:04:06,130
You did.

998
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:18,819
You got your bounty.

999
02:04:18,819 --> 02:04:19,819
This one can't.

1000
02:04:19,819 --> 02:04:20,819
I don't think this one goes on anymore.

1001
02:04:20,819 --> 02:04:24,300
That's the end.

1002
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,479
That's it for that one.

1003
02:04:25,479 --> 02:04:26,479
I'm going to be a squire.

1004
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:32,010
Character's name.

1005
02:04:32,010 --> 02:04:33,010
What about eternal darkness?

1006
02:04:33,010 --> 02:04:34,010
It's only been a couple hours.

1007
02:04:34,010 --> 02:04:37,939
We'll do like another couple.

1008
02:04:37,939 --> 02:04:40,970
Let me go pee first, actually.

1009
02:04:40,970 --> 02:04:44,579
I'm going to piss.

1010
02:04:44,579 --> 02:04:45,579
I'll be right back.

1011
02:04:45,579 --> 02:04:47,579
Oh, man.

1012
02:04:47,579 --> 02:04:50,359
I just got hurt in the bathroom.

1013
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:51,359
I actually just got hurt in the bathroom.

1014
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:52,359
I started.

1015
02:04:52,359 --> 02:04:53,359
Okay.

1016
02:04:53,359 --> 02:04:54,359
I started just laughing.

1017
02:04:54,359 --> 02:06:27,699
I started pissing.

1018
02:06:27,699 --> 02:06:28,699
And it was, it was a full big 60 seconds.

1019
02:06:28,699 --> 02:06:29,699
I'm going to piss.

1020
02:06:29,699 --> 02:06:30,699
I'm going to piss.

1021
02:06:30,699 --> 02:06:31,699
I'm going to piss.

1022
02:06:31,699 --> 02:06:33,189
I'm going to piss.

1023
02:06:33,189 --> 02:06:34,189
I'm going to piss.

1024
02:06:34,189 --> 02:06:35,189
I'm going to piss.

1025
02:06:36,189 --> 02:06:37,189
I'm going to piss.

1026
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:38,189
I'm going to piss.

1027
02:06:38,189 --> 02:06:39,189
I'm going to piss.

1028
02:06:39,189 --> 02:06:40,189
I'm going to piss.

1029
02:06:40,189 --> 02:06:41,189

02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:09,380
I'm going to piss.

02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:10,380

I'm going to piss.

1094
02:09:45,699 --> 02:09:46,699
I'm going to piss.

1095
02:09:46,699 --> 02:09:47,699
It was worth it.

1096
02:09:47,699 --> 02:09:48,699
It was worth it.

1097
02:09:48,699 --> 02:09:49,699
I'll take that.

1098
02:09:49,699 --> 02:09:51,189
I will take that pain.

1099
02:09:51,189 --> 02:09:52,189
Oh my god.

1100
02:09:52,189 --> 02:09:53,619
That was so stupid.

1101
02:09:53,619 --> 02:09:54,619
All right.

1102
02:09:54,619 --> 02:09:56,250
Here we go.

1103
02:09:56,250 --> 02:10:00,609
You are Walter, a squire living in the kingdom of Larian.

1104
02:10:00,609 --> 02:10:03,989
You have a spear and a pack of supplies.

1105
02:10:03,989 --> 02:10:06,970
You follow Sir Theo as he enters the forest.

1106
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:12,630
He turns to you and says, if we split up, we'll find the orcs much quicker.

1107
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:17,310
Very well, sir, you reply, knowing he is far more experienced in fighting than you are.

1108
02:10:17,310 --> 02:10:28,029
I'm not going to split up, I'm going to follow him.

1109
02:10:28,029 --> 02:10:31,359
Silently follow Sir Theo.

1110
02:10:31,359 --> 02:10:41,670
Yeah, I'm going to be hiding behind him and see.

1111
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:44,949
Hey, you silently follow Sir Theo into the forest.

1112
02:10:44,949 --> 02:10:49,460
Quietly, you sneak forward, moving slowly so as not to make any noise.

1113
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:53,779
You look around, taking in your surroundings and noting that the trees are getting thicker.

1114
02:10:53,779 --> 02:11:07,399
Continue to follow Sir Theo.

1115
02:11:07,399 --> 02:11:12,539
You continue to follow Sir Theo, ducking under branches and taking care not to trip.

1116
02:11:12,539 --> 02:11:15,020
You hear a twig snap behind you and pause.

1117
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:19,579
Isn't that just me?

1118
02:11:19,579 --> 02:11:21,460
I'm ripping through twigs and stuff?

1119
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:22,460
That's me?

1120
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:23,460
I'm doing that.

1121
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:27,000
Turn around.

1122
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:39,770
You turn around and grab your spear tightly, calling out, who's there?

1123
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:44,350
You hear a faint laugh and response and quickly jab your spear in the direction of the noise.

1124
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:46,039
Gotcha!

1125
02:11:46,039 --> 02:11:47,039
The voice says.

1126
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:50,970
I didn't get him?

1127
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:57,010
Did you get me?

1128
02:11:57,010 --> 02:12:04,659
Turn around again and see Sir Theo behind you smiling.

1129
02:12:04,659 --> 02:12:09,220
You get jumpy over the smallest things, boy.

1130
02:12:09,220 --> 02:12:13,460
What is it?

1131
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:14,460
Who are you?

1132
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:15,460
Wait, is it?

1133
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:16,699
Wait, it was him.

1134
02:12:16,699 --> 02:12:22,140
He pranked me.

1135
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:26,119
Don't do that.

1136
02:12:26,119 --> 02:12:27,119
That's not funny.

1137
02:12:27,119 --> 02:12:37,510
Alright, I'm sorry.

1138
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:38,510
Come on.

1139
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:42,310
Better keep going.

1140
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:44,909
He sets off into the forest again and you follow once more.

1141
02:12:44,909 --> 02:12:51,529
What's our mission?

1142
02:12:51,529 --> 02:12:57,399
Follow Sir Theo and enter the forest and as he turns, as we split, okay, so what's the

1143
02:12:57,399 --> 02:13:03,050
actual mission, though?

1144
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:09,630
Sing a lovely song as we travel to kill orcs.

1145
02:13:09,630 --> 02:13:10,630
Okay, yeah, kill orcs.

1146
02:13:10,630 --> 02:13:15,260
Right, right, right.

1147
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:16,859
You sing a lovely song.

1148
02:13:16,859 --> 02:13:25,689
Sir Theo takes a moment to think, then starts singing in a beautiful angelic voice.

1149
02:13:25,689 --> 02:13:39,050
Harmonize with Sir Theo.

1150
02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:42,329
Sir Theo smiles as you join in with his song.

1151
02:13:42,329 --> 02:13:45,050
The two of you sing together as you walk through the forest.

1152
02:13:45,050 --> 02:13:48,460
Wow, lovely.

1153
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:55,869
What about the orcs?

1154
02:13:55,869 --> 02:14:00,270
Oh, right.

1155
02:14:00,270 --> 02:14:01,270
Where are the orcs?

1156
02:14:01,270 --> 02:14:11,010
It's a medieval musical.

1157
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:12,810
Sir Theo looks around in frowns.

1158
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:13,810
I don't know.

1159
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:16,369
I thought we would have encountered them by now.

1160
02:14:16,369 --> 02:14:22,159
Oh, we need to keep a lookout just in case.

1161
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:25,420
I'll take first shift.

1162
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:38,180
Very well, Sir Theo says, sitting down on a rock.

1163
02:14:38,180 --> 02:14:41,149
I suggest you keep alert.

1164
02:14:41,149 --> 02:14:42,829
Orcs can show up at any moment.

1165
02:14:42,829 --> 02:14:57,850
Why do you sound like that?

1166
02:14:57,850 --> 02:14:59,329
Sir Theo looks confused.

1167
02:14:59,329 --> 02:15:02,090
I don't understand.

1168
02:15:02,090 --> 02:15:04,010
Your voice, it's all ruined.

1169
02:15:04,010 --> 02:15:28,470
Yes, it's a side effect of using too much power.

1170
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:31,020
I'll get it back eventually.

1171
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:33,500
Now wake me up in four hours.

1172
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:40,020
With that, he lies down on the ground and closes his eyes.

1173
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:59,050
Leave Sir Theo immediately.

1174
02:15:59,050 --> 02:16:00,609
You leave Sir Theo immediately.

1175
02:16:00,609 --> 02:16:05,189
As soon as your back is turned, Sir Theo teleports behind you.

1176
02:16:05,189 --> 02:16:08,779
He grabs your shoulders and whispers,

1177
02:16:08,779 --> 02:16:14,500
They're too trusting, boy.

1178
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:22,659
OK, spin around.

1179
02:16:22,659 --> 02:16:25,899
Spin around with weapon in hand.

1180
02:16:25,899 --> 02:16:34,370
I'll tell you, this guy's a bad guy.

1181
02:16:34,370 --> 02:16:35,809
Spin around and swing your weapon.

1182
02:16:35,809 --> 02:16:37,649
But Sir Theo twists out of the way.

1183
02:16:37,649 --> 02:16:42,520
Your weapon cuts through the air and slices into his arm.

1184
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:45,360
I thought he got, OK, blood begins to soak his sleeve

1185
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:49,299
as he draws a sword.

1186
02:16:49,299 --> 02:16:52,190
What was your real plan?

1187
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:53,350
Hmm?

1188
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:57,250
Go, go hunt orcs in the fucking forest?

1189
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:58,819
Lie.

1190
02:16:58,819 --> 02:17:03,149
You guys didn't catch that right away, I did.

1191
02:17:03,149 --> 02:17:06,700
Sir Theo looks down at his sword and sighs.

1192
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:09,620
I was going to make sure you were safe.

1193
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:11,819
But if you don't trust me now, I suppose

1194
02:17:11,819 --> 02:17:21,239
you don't have to live with that.

1195
02:17:21,239 --> 02:17:24,780
I'm sorry.

1196
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:28,399
Thought you were a bad guy.

1197
02:17:28,399 --> 02:17:37,959
I thought you were evil.

1198
02:17:37,959 --> 02:17:42,899
What happened?

1199
02:17:42,899 --> 02:17:50,020
Where am I?

1200
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:55,100
OK, so what has happened is I press the back button.

1201
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:58,579
And this is when I searched for AI Dungeon an hour and a half

1202
02:17:58,579 --> 02:17:59,180
ago to play it.

1203
02:17:59,180 --> 02:18:04,610
And I spelt it just a little incorrect.

1204
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:16,450
Just a little.

1205
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:17,729
Fuck.

1206
02:18:17,729 --> 02:18:21,510
Now I can't.

1207
02:18:21,510 --> 02:18:26,149
I have to log in again.

1208
02:18:26,149 --> 02:18:28,430
No.

1209
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:33,760
Hold on.

1210
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:34,760
I just pressed forward.

1211
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:35,559
Yeah, I just did it.

1212
02:18:35,559 --> 02:18:38,520
I pressed forward.

1213
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:39,079
Damn it.

1214
02:18:39,079 --> 02:18:45,950
We were getting somewhere with that one, too.

1215
02:18:45,950 --> 02:18:49,110
It's because of the stupid mouse button.

1216
02:18:49,110 --> 02:18:51,110
OK, there's a back button on the on.

1217
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:55,440
If you buy a razor mouse, your back thumb button

1218
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:58,049
is going to be go back.

1219
02:18:58,049 --> 02:19:11,290
It saves it.

1220
02:19:11,290 --> 02:19:18,790
Please pray.

1221
02:19:18,790 --> 02:19:31,870
What?

1222
02:19:31,870 --> 02:19:41,889
Oh, sick.

1223
02:19:41,889 --> 02:19:44,979
I'm sorry, I thought you were evil.

1224
02:19:44,979 --> 02:19:46,510
I understand.

1225
02:19:46,510 --> 02:19:48,090
It's not your fault.

1226
02:19:48,090 --> 02:19:50,180
I should have told you my plan.

1227
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:56,299
Sir Theo looks down and then looks you in the eye.

1228
02:19:56,299 --> 02:19:58,299
What is the plan, then?

1229
02:19:58,299 --> 02:20:09,979
What is the plan?

1230
02:20:09,979 --> 02:20:12,620
I need you to do exactly as I say.

1231
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:17,430
Do you trust me?

1232
02:20:17,430 --> 02:20:20,540
Do I?

1233
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:21,059
What if I just don't?

1234
02:20:21,059 --> 02:20:22,260
I don't think I trust him.

1235
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:24,579
OK, yes.

1236
02:20:24,579 --> 02:20:25,299
No, I don't.

1237
02:20:25,299 --> 02:20:26,100
I'm going to be honest.

1238
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:27,180
No, I don't trust you.

1239
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:33,840
I don't.

1240
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:35,000
You're not going to trust me.

1241
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,709
This conversation is over.

1242
02:20:37,709 --> 02:20:39,479
Fine, I trust you.

1243
02:20:39,479 --> 02:20:42,020
Good.

1244
02:20:42,020 --> 02:20:44,379
I trust you.

1245
02:20:44,379 --> 02:20:53,719
I will do everything you say.

1246
02:20:53,719 --> 02:20:54,639
We got telltale?

1247
02:20:54,639 --> 02:20:58,940
Yeah.

1248
02:20:58,940 --> 02:20:59,540
Do you trust me?

1249
02:20:59,540 --> 02:21:01,059
Yes, you reply.

1250
02:21:01,059 --> 02:21:06,129
Good boy.

1251
02:21:06,129 --> 02:21:18,430
What's next?

1252
02:21:18,430 --> 02:21:20,120
We need to split up.

1253
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:21,520
I'm going to head through the mountains

1254
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:23,139
towards the Orc fortress.

1255
02:21:23,139 --> 02:21:25,170
You head north along the trade route

1256
02:21:25,170 --> 02:21:28,739
and meet up with Captain Brannock's men at the fortress.

1257
02:21:28,739 --> 02:21:32,100
I like that one better.

1258
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:33,180
Head along the north trade route

1259
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:37,940
and meet up with Captain Brannock.

1260
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:42,069
I don't feel safe splitting up.

1261
02:21:42,069 --> 02:21:44,389
I'm a squire.

1262
02:21:44,389 --> 02:21:47,190
Isn't a squire supposed to follow around there at night?

1263
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:49,389
Why would you tell a squire, go fuck off somewhere

1264
02:21:49,389 --> 02:21:56,639
and go get lost in the woods?

1265
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:58,680
If we travel together and word gets around

1266
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:02,600
that you're helping the knights, our plan will be ruined.

1267
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:04,899
We need to keep you safe.

1268
02:22:04,899 --> 02:22:12,500
I don't like this plan.

1269
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:18,520
Fine, follow the plan.

1270
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:19,520
I am a squire.

1271
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,930
That's what I'm supposed to do.

1272
02:22:22,930 --> 02:22:25,190
Ah, good boy.

1273
02:22:25,190 --> 02:22:27,270
Get you a nice apple once I'm inside.

1274
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:28,909
How does that sound?

1275
02:22:28,909 --> 02:22:35,520
Yeah, that sounds good.

1276
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:42,219
Am I a horse, Theo?

1277
02:22:42,219 --> 02:22:46,430
Have I been a horse this whole time?

1278
02:22:46,430 --> 02:22:48,870
And that's why he's trying to get me to go back

1279
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:51,149
and take a different route and get away and go that way.

1280
02:22:51,149 --> 02:23:15,879
And I think you know the answers to that,

1281
02:23:15,879 --> 02:23:17,000
Sir Theo smiles.

1282
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:17,959
You nod slowly.

1283
02:23:17,959 --> 02:23:24,559
Yes, yes I am.

1284
02:23:24,559 --> 02:23:42,770
I'll see you when you get out.

1285
02:23:42,770 --> 02:23:44,129
I'll see you when you get out.

1286
02:23:44,129 --> 02:23:46,170
I'll see you when I get out, he smiles.

1287
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:48,229
He turns and walks through the mountains.

1288
02:23:48,229 --> 02:24:00,100
You set off along the road to find Captain Brannock's men.

1289
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:03,159
You, what's a horse do?

1290
02:24:03,159 --> 02:24:06,549
Throttle, trottle, gallop.

1291
02:24:06,549 --> 02:24:08,639
You trottle, trottle.

1292
02:24:08,639 --> 02:24:15,420
What would it be?

1293
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:20,149
Trot along the mountain's edge.

1294
02:24:20,149 --> 02:24:24,229
Barely being able to stand

1295
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:40,840
on, barely being able, barely able to balance.

1296
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:43,540
You set off along the road to find Captain Brannock's men.

1297
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:45,540
You trot along the mountain's edge.

1298
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:48,809
Heading north for nearly a mile before you find the men.

1299
02:24:48,809 --> 02:24:51,729
They're camped in a gap between two large rocks

1300
02:24:51,729 --> 02:24:53,299
just off the road.

1301
02:24:53,299 --> 02:25:00,569
You walk into the camp and find a fire burning cheerfully.

1302
02:25:00,569 --> 02:25:09,180
Gallop over a mile.

1303
02:25:09,180 --> 02:25:15,219
How big was that mountain?

1304
02:25:15,219 --> 02:25:19,340
You walk slowly over to the men.

1305
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:21,739
Clicking on the stones, your hooves.

1306
02:25:21,739 --> 02:25:24,020
You approach the fire and stand by it.

1307
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:28,159
One of the men notices you and approaches.

1308
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:36,049
Oh, hello there.

1309
02:25:36,049 --> 02:25:53,670
Is Captain Brannock around?

1310
02:25:53,670 --> 02:25:55,139
Horses don't talk.

1311
02:25:55,139 --> 02:25:56,139
This one does apparently

1312
02:25:56,139 --> 02:26:01,219
because Theo can understand everything I'm saying.

1313
02:26:01,219 --> 02:26:02,530
He's over there.

1314
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:03,790
The guard says pointing over

1315
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:14,120
to where a larger fire is burning.

1316
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:17,270
You want me to take your horse to the stable?

1317
02:26:17,270 --> 02:26:18,110
Yes, please.

1318
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:22,770
From a horse riding on top of a horse.

1319
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:27,879
Interesting.

1320
02:26:27,879 --> 02:26:29,149
Oh, okay.

1321
02:26:29,149 --> 02:26:31,149
And I love how the larger fire,

1322
02:26:31,149 --> 02:26:35,930
there's one fire and then a larger fire right there.

1323
02:26:35,930 --> 02:26:43,979
Go to the larger fire.

1324
02:26:43,979 --> 02:26:52,680
Horse kick somebody, I will.

1325
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:55,000
You walk over to the larger fire and stand by it.

1326
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,520
The warmth feels nice on your back

1327
02:26:56,520 --> 02:26:58,399
after a long ride in the cold.

1328
02:26:58,399 --> 02:26:59,920
One of the men notices you.

1329
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:11,610
Oh, hello there.

1330
02:27:11,610 --> 02:27:14,280
Theo is a mile long.

1331
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:17,520
Long one mile.

1332
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:20,860
You horse kick him into the fire.

1333
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:22,000
You lash out at the man,

1334
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,579
your hoof flying into his chest

1335
02:27:23,579 --> 02:27:25,299
and knocking him into the fire.

1336
02:27:25,299 --> 02:27:27,840
His screams are soon replaced by the sizzle of flesh

1337
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:36,110
and the smell of roasting human quickly fills the cave.

1338
02:27:36,110 --> 02:27:39,209
Go to Captain Ren.

1339
02:27:39,209 --> 02:27:43,440
Rannick?

1340
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:51,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1341
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:53,200
Where's Rannick?

1342
02:27:53,200 --> 02:28:05,219
Right.

1343
02:28:05,219 --> 02:28:06,979
The other guards stand drawing their weapons.

1344
02:28:06,979 --> 02:28:09,219
They advance on you, but you're not backing down.

1345
02:28:09,219 --> 02:28:13,379
You swing a hoof and knock a man's arm into his chest,

1346
02:28:13,379 --> 02:28:16,090
breaking it.

1347
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:28,649
Where is Rannick?

1348
02:28:28,649 --> 02:28:30,370
Breaking, yeah, breaking his,

1349
02:28:30,370 --> 02:28:35,790
I think it breaks his arm and stuffs it into his chest.

1350
02:28:35,790 --> 02:28:36,750
The men begin to surround you,

1351
02:28:36,750 --> 02:28:38,950
keeping out of the reach of your hooves.

1352
02:28:38,950 --> 02:28:40,469
One of them speaks up.

1353
02:28:40,469 --> 02:28:47,680
Captain Rannick, we have intruders.

1354
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:53,860
Captain Rannick slowly walks his way towards group.

1355
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:06,020
Next quest, help Sir Theo complete his quest.

1356
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:09,889
Oh, whatever, okay.

1357
02:29:09,889 --> 02:29:11,370
Captain Rannick slowly walks his way

1358
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:13,659
towards the group smiling.

1359
02:29:13,659 --> 02:29:15,059
Come on, lads.

1360
02:29:15,059 --> 02:29:17,159
We can take this one.

1361
02:29:17,159 --> 02:29:21,469
One of the men says charging at you.

1362
02:29:21,469 --> 02:29:26,959
Force kick him into a large group of people

1363
02:29:28,219 --> 02:29:33,059
that all have to catch you together

1364
02:29:33,059 --> 02:29:36,700
at least seven to eight people

1365
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:41,700
who then all fall down at the same time.

1366
02:29:48,889 --> 02:29:51,350
Somebody gets it, good.

1367
02:29:51,350 --> 02:29:59,040
As long as one of you gets it, that's all I care about.

1368
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:08,420
Force kick him into the crowd.

1369
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:10,540
You swing a hoof, knocking the man back into the crowd.

1370
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:12,819
He screams as he's tripled

1371
02:30:13,379 --> 02:30:18,959
and you nick another man's neck with your hoof.

1372
02:30:18,959 --> 02:30:36,059
I want answers, Rannick.

1373
02:30:36,059 --> 02:30:39,159
And you shan't receive them.

1374
02:30:39,159 --> 02:30:42,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, continue.

1375
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:55,000
One of the men jumps towards you swinging his sword.

1376
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:59,479
Force kick him in the head.

1377
02:30:59,479 --> 02:31:00,799
You swing a powerful hoof,

1378
02:31:00,799 --> 02:31:03,000
knocking the man's head clean off.

1379
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:06,190
It rolls to Captain Rannick's feet.

1380
02:31:06,190 --> 02:31:11,739
Oh dear me, he says stepping back.

1381
02:31:11,739 --> 02:31:16,319
Tell me everything you know.

1382
02:31:16,319 --> 02:31:19,239
Tell me everything you know.

1383
02:31:19,239 --> 02:31:29,520
You charge, knocking a guard off his feet

1384
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:31,129
and trampling him.

1385
02:31:31,129 --> 02:31:34,719
All right, all right, please no more.

1386
02:31:34,719 --> 02:31:40,500
Stop and look at him expectantly.

1387
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:54,209
What do you know?

1388
02:31:54,209 --> 02:31:57,530
It's a secret passage right behind you.

1389
02:31:57,530 --> 02:32:02,350
They use it to spy on us, I don't know why.

1390
02:32:02,350 --> 02:32:12,610
What do you mean?

1391
02:32:12,610 --> 02:32:14,329
Who's they?

1392
02:32:14,329 --> 02:32:18,450
I don't know, spies probably.

1393
02:32:18,450 --> 02:32:21,590
Guards slowly get up looking at you nervously.

1394
02:32:21,590 --> 02:32:25,829
Well, go on then.

1395
02:32:25,829 --> 02:32:31,000
How are they not sealed?

1396
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,700
There's passage there, Rannick says,

1397
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:35,040
nodding towards you.

1398
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:38,899
Look behind you, you'll see a small passage in the rocks.

1399
02:32:38,899 --> 02:32:40,059
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1400
02:32:43,149 --> 02:32:49,079
Why are you laughing?

1401
02:32:49,079 --> 02:32:57,690
This is a trap.

1402
02:32:57,690 --> 02:32:59,209
Why are you laughing?

1403
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:05,430
Because, ha, ha, ha, ha, it's a trick.

1404
02:33:05,430 --> 02:33:10,549
Once you go through, we'll shut the door and trap you in.

1405
02:33:10,549 --> 02:33:15,399
You lash out with a hoof.

1406
02:33:15,399 --> 02:33:19,260
Force, force kick him.

1407
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:32,389

1415
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:10,959

1417

Fine, then give me your sword. Of course Brannock says handing over his blade. I don't want to die. I

02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:51,450
Thank you. I won't forget this he whispers a new friend and you don't say anything

1423
02:36:51,489 --> 02:36:57,159
You just keep walking into the night after an hour or two of walking you come across an old wooden cabin

1424
02:36:57,159 --> 02:37:17,469
You walk up to it still carrying Brannock, you know this place. Yes

I use it for hunting you step forward walking into the cabin

1427
02:37:28,569 --> 02:37:48,940
Heavens do you own how many cabins do you own? Just this one?

1428
02:37:49,299 --> 02:37:54,319
Brannock says I was saving to buy a larger one with a fireplace and a wood stove

1429
02:37:54,399 --> 02:38:09,569
But I think I need a new hunting knife instead your hunter Brannock what animals did you hunt you know?

1431
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:26,389
Mostly dear Brannock says I also tracked and killed a few wolves

1432
02:38:26,989 --> 02:38:38,000

1439
02:40:39,879 --> 02:40:42,760
You stare at Brannock's crushed skull

Horrified by what you did you had to Brannock's ghost appears behind you we had to I'm sorry

02:41:20,469 --> 02:41:25,000

We need you to kill them kill them only a true king can kill another king

1445
02:41:49,879 --> 02:41:56,860
You must ascend the throne and kill the other kings Brannock says urgently

1446
02:41:57,500 --> 02:42:00,100
Only then can you be the one?

1447

True king I am a horse though, but I am a horse a horse

1448

Never be king, but I'm a horse a horse can never be king. You're not just any horse

1449
02:42:40,530 --> 02:42:48,729
Brannock says you're the horse that will raise up kill the king and become king yourself

1450
02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:57,979
Legally binding now it works

1451
02:42:57,979 --> 02:43:13,540
What if the king gets bit by a poisonous squirrel is a poisonous squirrel become the king of the world is that legally binding?

1452
02:43:13,579 --> 02:43:20,409
No, Brannock says Brannock's ghost fades away, and you turn to walk out of the cabin your adventure is over

1453
02:43:20,409 --> 02:43:31,479
No, no, no, we're no no we're going back. You're the horse that would raise up kill the king and become the king

02:47:27,180 --> 02:47:37,049
A pitiful moan before lying still Theo is dead. I'm the king now right I was gonna get

1480
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:39,600
That was gonna be a big screw job

1481
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:50,559
Okay, where's um where's Brannock look around for Brannock's ghost?

But I can't find Brannock's ghost. Maybe he has given up on you

1487
02:48:25,299 --> 02:48:30,299
There's nothing left to do here. You look at Theo's body before turning and walking away. I'm the king now

1488
02:48:30,979 --> 02:48:36,479
after

1489
02:48:36,479 --> 02:48:38,610

Thank you guys. That was ridiculous

02:49:52,750 --> 02:50:00,379
It was like five ten fifty twenty twenty thirty four. This is like probably a hundred subs here. Thank you

1500
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:11,930
Horseking that one was fucking I loved that one. You now become the new king. Congratulations the end

1501
02:50:12,329 --> 02:50:22,799
This wasn't the good ending though. What do you mean? That's not the good ending. I did everything I was supposed to do

1502
02:50:22,799 --> 02:50:35,780
That's the true ending. Let's do another one. I mean, this is we're gonna try to get something weird

1503
02:50:36,379 --> 02:50:43,389
Back hold on. Let's do let's make the randomness. I can sing wait eternal darkness

1504
02:50:44,069 --> 02:50:45,750
Yeah

1505
02:50:45,750 --> 02:50:47,540
but

1506
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:48,659
mmm

1507
02:50:48,659 --> 02:50:54,219
Yet promised eternal darkness

1508
02:50:54,940 --> 02:50:57,479
Yeah

1509
02:50:57,479 --> 02:51:00,909
Yeah

1510
02:51:00,909 --> 02:51:03,709
Did I did say that

1511
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:13,680
cyberpunk

1512
02:51:16,239 --> 02:51:22,559
Do it I told you the scenario was gonna play out where I was gonna want to do this here. All right. Here's my problem

1513
02:51:23,239 --> 02:51:25,079
my problem with doing

1514
02:51:25,079 --> 02:51:31,600
Her doctors now is cuz I've been streaming for three hours. I'm probably only gonna be live for like another hour or two

1515
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:34,120
typically, right

1516
02:51:34,120 --> 02:51:37,159
Starting that new game and only being gonna potentially play it for an hour

1517
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:46,219
I'd rather get that in there and do that for like five or six hours with a diary of a wimpy kid prompt

1518
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:54,250
Don't worry there. There will be vengeance for the eternal darkness voters

1519
02:51:54,250 --> 02:52:00,899
I promise that will be the next video game that we play. That's the next game

1520
02:52:00,899 --> 02:52:03,579
We're going to play on this stream is eternal darkness

1521
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:22,040
Sanity, whatever it is. That's the next game guys ready custom. Let's do something weird like you are

1522
02:52:22,799 --> 02:52:35,059
currently running from a tornado of a

1523
02:52:36,399 --> 02:52:41,340
shotgun and a pair of jeans and

1524
02:52:49,149 --> 02:52:52,389
Now you have a shotgun and a pair of sunglasses

1525
02:52:53,790 --> 02:53:06,709
You need to warn the city about the incoming

1526
02:53:08,180 --> 02:53:09,260
disaster

1527
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:22,340
There the tornado is coming. You just need to get out of here

1528
02:53:22,340 --> 02:53:30,170
The wind is picking up and it'll be too late soon in drive

1529
02:53:30,209 --> 02:53:42,030
I'm not gonna shoot the tornado you look at the tornado and realize that it can't possibly hit the city

1530
02:53:42,209 --> 02:53:44,729
It's not going to make it past the levees

1531
02:53:45,129 --> 02:53:56,420
You're going to have to do something else go home. I was wrong. I had it wrong

1532
02:53:56,819 --> 02:54:07,459
Go home you race back to your house the entire way you think about what could have caused this

1533
02:54:07,899 --> 02:54:13,829
You come up with several theories including global warming or the government and yeah

1534
02:54:13,829 --> 02:54:16,829
I mean it's probably if the tornado started and just stopped randomly

1535
02:54:16,829 --> 02:54:18,829
I'd be like what the fuck is happening with our planet?

1536
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:35,819
Let it play out one more time when you arrive at the house

1537
02:54:35,819 --> 02:54:40,620
You slam the car in the garage and head into the basement you sit in your home and begin watching TV

1538
02:54:40,620 --> 02:54:42,059
This is the Simpsons

1539
02:54:42,059 --> 02:54:44,940
They pulled that from the Simpsons

1540
02:54:45,180 --> 02:55:06,409
Okay, where's Marge turn on the news the news begins to talk about a brutal killing in Bel-Nor

1541
02:55:06,690 --> 02:55:10,750
You quickly change the station and switch to channel 45 the Hinsky News Network

1542
02:55:44,469 --> 02:55:47,209
Okay, James you drink out of your duff beer can

1543
02:55:47,670 --> 02:55:51,590
You go to the fridge and find a beer the news begins to talk about a brutal killing in Bel-Nor

1544
02:55:51,790 --> 02:55:55,129
You change the channel once more channel 35 news for now

1545
02:55:55,889 --> 02:56:01,629
Watch the news. What does Homer do?

1546
02:56:05,969 --> 02:56:13,030
You watch the news the news is showing a clip of you exiting Marge's bedroom this morning when the news was called

1547
02:56:13,750 --> 02:56:36,569
How do you do it? It's like no you say no

1548
02:56:37,370 --> 02:56:41,889
Realizing that you had been caught on tape you attempt to turn off the TV, but you notice something else

1549
02:56:41,889 --> 02:56:43,889
You appear to be live on the news

1550
02:56:44,010 --> 02:56:57,299
Hey, how did you get me on? How did you get me on the TV?

1551
02:56:58,100 --> 02:57:11,940
You look out the window and realize you have been surrounded by TV crews

1552
02:57:11,940 --> 02:57:22,639
You see a large boom being lowered from a helicopter towards your house Marge get down here

1553
02:57:22,879 --> 02:57:33,790
Why would they bring a huge boom mic you call for Marge?

1554
02:57:33,790 --> 02:57:36,909
She comes downstairs the boom stops outside your window

1555
02:57:37,510 --> 02:57:50,819
scream into the mic scream into the mic as

1556
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:53,920
loud as

1557
02:57:53,920 --> 02:58:03,920
You can you look out the window and Marge appears

1558
02:58:03,959 --> 02:58:07,959
She screams into the microphone the boom retracts into the helicopter which flies away

1559
02:58:08,399 --> 02:58:24,719
Marge has saved the day once again that's an area where he would do that

1560
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:34,489
You say don't again and realizing that you had been caught on tape a second time you turn off the TV you go to the

1561
02:58:34,489 --> 02:58:36,489
Window you realize that you're still being watched

1562
02:58:36,610 --> 02:58:58,799
What does he do he in every episode you go up to the Flanders house and ring their doorbell they open the door

1563
02:59:07,610 --> 02:59:12,200
How's the lawn? I don't know why I don't watch the Simpsons. I don't know what they do

1564
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:25,760
I know he comes out and goes. Oh, hey, diddly-dodley. I know that you say

1565
02:59:25,959 --> 02:59:31,239
How's the lawn hoping to make Ned mad Ned looks over at his dead lawn and gets an idea

1566
02:59:31,239 --> 02:59:49,000
He calls the fire department wait for the fire department five more subs from s10w slow update

1568
02:59:50,750 --> 02:59:58,469
You wait for the fire but you wait for the fire department outside 12 minutes later

1569
02:59:58,790 --> 03:00:05,790
You watch as the Bellnore fire department carries out all the furniture from your house Ned approaches you

1570
03:00:05,909 --> 03:00:14,780
Why are they taking all my furniture?

03:00:27,540 --> 03:00:31,639
Gives you a piggyback ride to the Bellnore fire department a year passes

1573
03:00:32,180 --> 03:00:35,680
Okay

1574
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:49,940
Now what it's been a year since the media attention died down although you still have not gotten your furniture back

1575
03:00:50,459 --> 03:00:54,180
Life has been good. You are suddenly interrupted by a knock at the door

1576
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:08,489
I'm just saying if there's a Simpsons

1577

You go to the front door you open it to find a large man in a cheap suit and a smaller man with a video

1583
03:01:41,440 --> 03:01:44,760
Camera behind him a large man pushes you aside and enters your house

Grab the small man's camera and smash it the small man grabs your wrist

1592
03:02:30,350 --> 03:02:34,329
The large man pulls out a knife and holds it to your throat

1593
03:02:34,889 --> 03:02:48,569
Try to say

1594
03:02:48,969 --> 03:02:54,879
Yo, but that all comes out as a quiet squeak the larger members cutting off your what

1595
03:02:55,799 --> 03:03:06,149
Wait, what it's okay?

1596

Jesus Christ shoot with shotgun like shoot them with I have a shotgun

1599
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:40,399
You grab your shotgun from near the door and fire at the two men the blast hits the small man's chest

1600
03:03:42,639 --> 03:03:44,639
Large man in the face

Killed instantly

1602
03:03:49,690 --> 03:04:05,370
You say

1603
03:04:05,649 --> 03:04:09,770
Celebrating your victory suddenly the wind begins to pick up trees begin to shake violently

1604
03:04:10,209 --> 03:04:23,280
The sky goes black as if it's nighttime. It's the twister run and grab the family

1605
03:04:23,639 --> 03:04:36,950
You run every you run out of your house and get into your car. I

1606
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:44,680
Can't do this today. It's too funny

1607
03:04:45,159 --> 03:04:50,290
You run out of your house and get into your car. You drive to go pick up Marge Jennifer and Megan

1608
03:04:50,649 --> 03:04:53,209
You drive to the Simpsons house

1609
03:04:53,649 --> 03:04:56,569
knock on the door

1610
03:04:56,569 --> 03:04:59,940
If Homer opens the store, I swear to God

1611
03:05:00,620 --> 03:05:08,299
Marge answers the door

1612
03:05:08,459 --> 03:05:19,040
My hello there neighbor. Homer here is Homer here today

1613
03:05:19,799 --> 03:05:36,120
You see that fan over there Marge points to a u-haul truck. That's my husband. He's moving out

1614
03:05:41,930 --> 03:05:54,770
Can I come in Marge divorce

1615
03:05:55,469 --> 03:06:09,590
German is mo with a sad face. I mean German is most sad face. Why would you be sad about that? What's what's wrong?

1616
03:06:09,629 --> 03:06:12,010
What's wrong with that? He runs his own goddamn business

1617
03:06:12,770 --> 03:06:17,569
Hey, you say can I come in and I come in sure

1618
03:06:18,170 --> 03:06:22,809
You enter the house. The house is empty. All the furniture has been packed away Maxwell appears. I

1619
03:06:24,200 --> 03:06:25,840

remember seeing you on the Simpsons

1621
03:06:28,959 --> 03:06:48,909
Who is this? I don't remember seeing you on the Simpsons. Let's just say I'm a distant relative

1622
03:06:49,389 --> 03:06:51,879
Why are the Simpsons moving?

1623
03:06:51,959 --> 03:07:06,209
Where are they going? I can't tell you that

1624
03:07:06,729 --> 03:07:12,559
Can I go with them? You have to stay here and look after this house. That's your job for Marge

1625
03:07:13,120 --> 03:07:42,540
You punch Maxwell in the face. He falls to the ground. Ha got you

1626
03:07:44,620 --> 03:07:46,780

03:14:34,379 --> 03:14:40,370

1688
03:15:25,780 --> 03:15:34,840
I just created a hundred more of them. Wait, there's a dragon

1689
03:15:35,360 --> 03:15:40,930
Mighty roar is heard you feel as though the very ground you're standing on is shaking

1690
03:15:41,250 --> 03:15:44,530
You see a massive winged beast flying above the clouds. It's headed your way

1691
03:15:45,129 --> 03:15:49,229
face the beast

1692
03:15:49,590 --> 03:15:51,389
in my truck

1693
03:15:51,389 --> 03:16:07,469
Try to keep it in sight, but to no avail it disappears from your view. It's still shaking the ground

1694
03:16:08,190 --> 03:16:15,709
use binoculars

1695
03:16:15,709 --> 03:16:26,690
We use binoculars to see the beast. The beast is huge. It's much larger than an airplane

1696
03:16:26,770 --> 03:16:29,290
What's more amazing is that it is clearly flying?

1697
03:16:30,090 --> 03:16:38,920
follow the beast

1698
03:16:39,079 --> 03:16:44,719
do with the shotgun from like a

1699
03:16:45,959 --> 03:16:47,959
15,000 feet below where he is

1700
03:16:48,079 --> 03:16:53,610
You continue to follow the beast keeping your eyes on it. It looks as if it's heading right towards you

1701
03:16:53,610 --> 03:17:02,680
It lets out another roar thrive down the beasts throat

1702
03:17:03,280 --> 03:17:21,659
It's that movie Bill Murray that it has like a cold and they get in there

1703
03:17:23,170 --> 03:17:28,459
It's like Punxsutawney Phil. What's it called? It's about the guy the

1704
03:17:30,489 --> 03:17:35,930
Osmosis Jones, that's what it is. I'm gonna Osmosis Jones this motherfucker right now

1705
03:17:36,510 --> 03:17:38,510
You see the beasts insides

1706
03:17:38,950 --> 03:17:46,809
Everything is redness and carnage. You manage to make out a road running along the beasts throat drive down the road

1707
03:17:47,409 --> 03:18:00,399
Yep, drive down the road after driving down the beast throat for quite some time

1708
03:18:00,639 --> 03:18:08,000
You reach a beaver that is holding a sign in front of it that reads next services heartburn hotel next left

1709
03:18:13,309 --> 03:18:14,829
Heartburn Hotel

1710
03:18:14,829 --> 03:18:21,620
All right, go to the heartburn. I'm gonna go to the heartburn hotel and just like put a bunch of hot peppers

1712
03:18:26,639 --> 03:18:48,850
Next services go to the heartburn hotel the beaver waves at you as you pull into the hotel parking lot

1713
03:18:48,850 --> 03:18:56,159
He holds a sign in front of him that reads hotel lobby this way go to the hotel lobby

1714
03:18:56,840 --> 03:18:59,920
He's gonna be the clerk at he's gonna be the person at registration

1715
03:19:00,420 --> 03:19:10,680
Go to the hotel lobby you walk into the hotel lobby a man dressed in a fancy tuxedo stands behind a counter

1716
03:19:10,680 --> 03:19:19,540
He smiles at you ask to be

1717
03:19:20,299 --> 03:19:22,510

1718
03:19:22,510 --> 03:19:23,870
the

1719
03:19:23,870 --> 03:19:25,069
Oh

1720
03:19:25,069 --> 03:19:36,780
Like the yes, we brought to the not the stove a basement. I want to go to the heater

1721
03:19:36,780 --> 03:19:40,879
I want to like because this is like his heartburn. We're gonna make it worse. So he pukes us out

1722
03:19:41,059 --> 03:19:59,229
Yeah, we're gonna go in there be like hey something's wrong with your basement the heater

1723
03:19:59,229 --> 03:20:11,000
I gotta go down there and take a look at it the plot to a monkey island game

1724
03:20:11,719 --> 03:20:19,260
It is are you asked to be brought to the basement to see the heater. You're pretending to be a repairman

1725
03:20:19,760 --> 03:20:23,200
Your thing sir. Just take the elevator to your right

1726
03:20:23,520 --> 03:20:27,280
Let me get the keys to room 2 2 1 where the basement is located. Oh

1727
03:20:29,639 --> 03:20:31,159
That would not be a basement

1728
03:20:31,719 --> 03:20:51,399
Go to room go to room 2 2 1 the man hands you the keys to room 2 2 1 you thank him and

1729
03:20:51,600 --> 03:20:56,909
Walk towards the elevator you get in the elevator and press B or basement

1730
03:20:57,110 --> 03:21:11,600
There's B. Let's see what happens you exit the elevator and find yourself in a hallway

1731
03:21:12,120 --> 03:21:21,510
Heartburn hotel basement where service is still the most important thing in the world. The hallway is made of cement ask

1732
03:21:22,030 --> 03:21:25,469
Ask the clerk

1733
03:21:25,750 --> 03:21:28,309
He's shown

1734
03:21:29,290 --> 03:21:41,129
Heater ask the clerk to show you where the heater is there you go

1735
03:21:41,450 --> 03:21:54,170
You asked the clerk to show you where the heater is certainly follow me. He stands up and walked down the hallway

1736
03:21:54,170 --> 03:22:01,799
He stops in front of room 2 2 1 a this is it go into 2 2 1 a

1737
03:22:02,719 --> 03:22:15,350
Game has probably forgotten that we're in a dragon probably

1738
03:22:15,790 --> 03:22:21,909
Okay, you go to 2 2 1 a you walk into the boiler room. It's fairly large with two large boilers in the center

1739
03:22:22,909 --> 03:22:27,350
so what we just break them so we give him indigestion and he gets like we make the

1740
03:22:27,969 --> 03:22:32,329
Heating elements spill out into the hotel, which is that's his stomach or whatever and then he gets sick

1741
03:22:32,930 --> 03:22:34,489
We're gonna smash him

1742
03:22:34,489 --> 03:22:38,719
Burn up. Okay, turn the heat up turn the heat up

1743
03:22:40,270 --> 03:22:41,750
It's

1744
03:22:41,750 --> 03:22:51,430
Maximum turn the heat up to max turn the heat up to maximum turn the heat up to maximum heat

1745
03:22:51,870 --> 03:23:03,540
Turn the heat up to maximum heat the boilers begin to hiss as they begin to output more heat

1746
03:23:03,860 --> 03:23:06,739
You exit the boiler room and head back to the hotel lobby

1747
03:23:07,100 --> 03:23:23,079
Come on the clerk at the front desk looks up at you and smiles all fixed. He asks

1748
03:23:23,260 --> 03:23:32,000
Yeah, sorry about that. You walk out of the hotel back into your truck you drive away

1749
03:23:32,879 --> 03:23:38,700
See in the rear view mirror

1750
03:23:41,909 --> 03:23:43,149
Hava

1751
03:23:43,149 --> 03:23:46,129
pouring out of the windows

1752
03:23:47,030 --> 03:24:03,360
No, no, not that either all fixed. Yeah all fixed

1753
03:24:03,360 --> 03:24:10,319
I feel like this is at the point of the movie where in this music too

1754
03:24:11,670 --> 03:24:17,950
I have the thing that I needed to take out of the hotel in my hand and I'm putting it behind my back and it's a

1755
03:24:17,950 --> 03:24:22,030
Big jacket and stuff and it's like a comedy routine where like I'm really trying to not have them see what I have

1756
03:24:22,430 --> 03:24:26,870
They have no idea and they're just like I'll have a good day and I think that they're like really suspicious

1757
03:24:26,870 --> 03:24:44,139
But they're just not how do I write that? Oh, yeah, this is Dragonair

1758
03:24:44,819 --> 03:24:49,239
do a comedy scene

1759
03:24:49,639 --> 03:24:54,959
drive

1760
03:24:54,959 --> 03:24:56,959
towards the dragons

1761
03:24:57,799 --> 03:25:03,399
Throat because then with a heartburn hotel, let's drive towards the throat

1762
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:14,159
Drive towards the dragon's throat. The dragon's throat is still dark, but not as dark as it was earlier

1763
03:25:14,159 --> 03:25:20,170
You can see a red glow coming from deep within I guess can continue

1764
03:25:21,319 --> 03:25:22,280
forward

1765
03:25:22,280 --> 03:25:35,129
Through the dragon's digestive system. Are you showing me open it?

1766
03:25:35,129 --> 03:25:38,010
I'm what you can't just make somebody open a present

1767
03:25:38,010 --> 03:25:46,959
You don't sit down and stuff a present in my face and go open it now

1768
03:25:47,239 --> 03:26:00,450
No, I don't want I don't know what's in that fucking present the way this is oh, okay, that's what that is

1769
03:26:00,969 --> 03:26:08,870
This is me smashing ps2 the board game

1770
03:26:09,469 --> 03:26:17,819
Joe scooby-doo. What do you have a scooby-doo? Ah

1771
03:26:22,399 --> 03:26:41,440
Wait this I clicked on the wrong one. This is is this even my face. This is my eyes and mouth on scooby-doo

1772
03:26:41,440 --> 03:26:49,510
I mean, I guess it kind of works. I feel like my mouth looks like that sometimes

1773
03:26:50,030 --> 03:26:59,209
Okay, let's keep going continue forward through the dragon's digestive system

1774
03:26:59,250 --> 03:27:08,799
You can take forward through the dragon's digestive system

1775
03:27:08,799 --> 03:27:14,520
You travel through the darkness not knowing what is in store you drive past rows and rows of teeth all shapes and sizes

1776
03:27:14,520 --> 03:27:22,979
This is a long trip. We've been on this road for a very long time. Oh

1777
03:27:26,450 --> 03:27:36,420
Down the dragon's throat into his stomach. I suppose stomach

1778
03:27:36,420 --> 03:27:49,629
I want to get in there drive deep into the dragon's stomach. There we go. All right, we're in this tree

1779
03:27:49,629 --> 03:27:50,709
Now we're in the dragon's stomach

1780
03:27:50,709 --> 03:27:59,540
There's a quite a large chamber you park your truck next to a rather large mound of half digested cows

1781
03:27:59,780 --> 03:28:26,489
You exit your vehicle and look around the chamber walls. Maybe somebody's alive down here. Is anyone here you shout into the darkness

1782
03:28:26,489 --> 03:28:28,290
Is anyone here?

1783
03:28:28,290 --> 03:28:43,649
Suddenly a large section of the chamber wall begins to move it reveals a tunnel which continues further down into the darkness back in my truck

1784
03:28:44,129 --> 03:28:58,299
Get back in your truck. You quickly run back into your truck and drive down the tunnel

1785
03:28:58,540 --> 03:29:05,649
The tunnel is long and twisty. You hope you can remember how to get back in you forward

1786
03:29:05,969 --> 03:29:21,149
All begins to slope downward and you can feel a change in air pressure you reach the end of the tunnel which opens up

1787
03:29:21,149 --> 03:29:22,790
into a large chamber

1788
03:29:22,790 --> 03:29:25,610
Drive out of the chamber

1789
03:29:25,729 --> 03:29:40,350
You drive out of the chamber you pull out of the tunnel and into the large chamber

1790
03:29:40,350 --> 03:29:44,190
You can see lights up ahead somebody must be here. You put your truck in park and get out

1791
03:29:46,989 --> 03:29:48,909
investigate the lights

1792
03:29:48,909 --> 03:30:02,190
Walk towards the lights as you approach them. You see a large rectangular opening in the ground

1793
03:30:02,590 --> 03:30:05,549
Ropes harnesses and other climbing equipment is lying around

1794
03:30:10,959 --> 03:30:16,899
Interesting you have found a climbing camp

1795
03:30:17,459 --> 03:30:21,780
Suddenly you hear the roar of a dragon. The sound is very close and very loud

1796
03:30:22,500 --> 03:30:24,739
You look up just in time to see a large dragon

1797
03:30:25,540 --> 03:30:26,500
but

1798
03:30:26,500 --> 03:30:30,909
Flying in your direction

1799
03:30:30,909 --> 03:30:39,389
Huh, but he's flying at me backwards with his ass

1800
03:30:48,290 --> 03:30:49,899
Ah

1801
03:30:49,899 --> 03:30:55,139
Okay, so what happened?

1802
03:30:55,139 --> 03:31:00,739
What happened wait back it up? Okay, do I run?

1803
03:31:04,610 --> 03:31:06,610
Get back in the truck

1804
03:31:06,930 --> 03:31:31,600
You dive back into your truck the dragon butt misses you by mere inches and instead crashes through the windshield of your truck

1805
03:31:32,000 --> 03:31:46,750
The tail continues on and crashes through the back window. Can you driving? I can see i'll be fine

1806
03:31:47,069 --> 03:31:57,899
I can just lean out the window like jim carrey hit the gas pedal and try to drive away

1807
03:31:57,899 --> 03:32:04,139
But the dragon butt is lodged firmly in your truck. You back up a little to dislodge it, but it's no use

1808
03:32:04,620 --> 03:32:24,500
The ass is too big. What the fuck what the hell? What the hell are you doing in my tent?

1809
03:32:24,659 --> 03:32:48,209
Damn it. Get the hell out. I'm sorry. Who are you say? I'm sorry. Who are you?

1810
03:32:49,860 --> 03:32:52,739
Oh, it's fucked up back it up

1811
03:32:54,940 --> 03:32:58,719
um

1812
03:32:58,719 --> 03:33:04,850
Uh, just fuck this guy just tent down rip down the tent

1813
03:33:13,600 --> 03:33:22,670
You rip down the tent you pull the ropes ripping the entire tent down your anger is out of control

1814
03:33:23,549 --> 03:33:32,100
The other climber wakes up and looks around in shock. How do I get out of here?

1815
03:33:32,659 --> 03:33:50,540
How do I get out of here? Wait, who are you? What are you doing in my tent?

1816
03:33:51,700 --> 03:33:53,700
I asked the question

1817
03:33:53,780 --> 03:34:08,000
Hey, you're that guy that was driving down the road. What are you doing here?

1818
03:34:08,559 --> 03:34:11,180
I got eaten

1819
03:34:11,180 --> 03:34:13,620
by the dragon

1820
03:34:13,620 --> 03:34:14,739
stupid

1821
03:34:14,739 --> 03:34:28,180
I gotta be mean to this guy

1822
03:34:28,180 --> 03:34:32,989
On purpose. I mean was it on purpose or was it the last ditch effort thing that I could do?

1823
03:34:33,790 --> 03:34:37,469
He's coming straight at me opens his mouth. What am I gonna do not just drive down his throat?

1824
03:34:37,870 --> 03:34:49,200
Gotta word that better. What are you doing here? The dragon ate me

1825
03:34:50,670 --> 03:34:52,670
I had the dragon eat me on purpose

1826
03:35:08,030 --> 03:35:10,030
You did what are you insane?

1827
03:35:11,940 --> 03:35:13,540
Maybe a little

1828
03:35:13,540 --> 03:35:25,020
You in?

1829
03:35:25,020 --> 03:35:30,540
Hell, yes, i'm in those treasure hunters are cold-blooded killers. There's no way i'm going back to that camp

1830
03:35:31,180 --> 03:35:34,799
What's your name?

1831
03:35:34,799 --> 03:35:48,700
How many people are actually in this dragon? I'm perney perney the climber

1832
03:35:49,260 --> 03:35:52,940
I was hired by the treasure hunters to rope down and examine the structure of the ruins

1833
03:35:56,190 --> 03:36:01,489
Do you know you are inside of a dragon's?

1834
03:36:02,370 --> 03:36:05,729
ass

1835
03:36:05,729 --> 03:36:07,729
I I don't he might not know

1836
03:36:20,139 --> 03:36:24,209
Ernie stares at you in disbelief. You've got to be kidding me

1837
03:36:25,340 --> 03:36:26,540
Not kidding

1838
03:36:26,540 --> 03:36:38,670
Ernie looks around nervously

1839
03:36:38,670 --> 03:36:40,909
How the hell did we end up inside a dragon?

1840
03:36:41,790 --> 03:36:45,229
I knew those treasure hunter guys were crazy. They always go looking for dragons

1841
03:36:45,870 --> 03:36:58,780
Have any supplies?

1842
03:36:58,780 --> 03:37:03,979
Sadly, no, they only supplied me with the bare minimum and they took the rest of my gear before throwing me in here

1843
03:37:08,340 --> 03:37:10,340
Do you have a sled?

1844
03:37:10,959 --> 03:37:12,399
Can you

1845
03:37:12,399 --> 03:37:14,399
Make me a sled

1846
03:37:20,620 --> 03:37:23,420
The car is destroyed remember reverse butt dragon

1847
03:37:24,059 --> 03:37:28,290
Killed to crush the car

1848
03:37:28,290 --> 03:37:30,750
Can you make me a sled?

1849
03:37:30,750 --> 03:37:32,989
a sled why

1850
03:37:33,069 --> 03:37:35,069
So I can ride the dragon

1851
03:37:35,409 --> 03:37:37,729
Ernie rushes up to you and takes you by the shoulders

1852
03:37:42,030 --> 03:37:50,100
And what does he do?

1853
03:37:50,100 --> 03:37:54,780
Ernie rushes up and takes you by the shoulders. She stares deep into your eyes

1854
03:37:56,459 --> 03:37:58,459
Look, i'm going to be completely honest with you

1855
03:37:59,579 --> 03:38:12,079
There is no way you are riding this dragon. Why not? Why i'm curious

1856
03:38:12,399 --> 03:38:18,959
It's the only chance either of us have of getting out of here alive

1857
03:38:20,459 --> 03:38:23,659
You're not a dragon rider. I can tell just by looking at you

1858
03:38:26,659 --> 03:38:27,860
I think

1859
03:38:27,860 --> 03:38:30,799
We can

1860
03:38:30,879 --> 03:38:32,959
Oh not

1861
03:38:32,959 --> 03:38:35,360
You don't

1862
03:38:35,360 --> 03:38:45,170
I'll prove it to you another NPC. Yeah another NPC

1863
03:38:45,889 --> 03:38:56,850
I'll prove it to you

1864
03:38:56,850 --> 03:39:01,899
That's not accurate. This is this is not what I like at like the county fair

1865
03:39:07,840 --> 03:39:10,780
Okay, that's a little better. How about this one?

1866
03:39:10,940 --> 03:39:12,780
It's the exact same song

1867
03:39:12,780 --> 03:39:14,059
How did I do that?

1868
03:39:14,059 --> 03:39:15,180
Here we go

1869
03:39:15,180 --> 03:39:20,270
Ernie grabs your shoulders and looks deep into your eyes. She begins to speak

1870
03:39:20,829 --> 03:39:31,459
I'm going to ask you a series of questions

1871
03:39:31,860 --> 03:39:34,100
And I want you to answer them as quickly as you can

1872
03:39:34,899 --> 03:39:38,110
Ready? Have you ever ridden a dragon before?

1873
03:39:39,840 --> 03:39:43,870
No, I mean

1874
03:39:43,950 --> 03:39:53,260
Yes

1875
03:39:53,260 --> 03:40:01,360
Never never Ernie frowns and lets go of you. Is that going to

1876
03:40:01,920 --> 03:40:13,090
Going to be a problem. What a bad lie. Yeah, I failed my uh, I failed my speech check. Yeah

1877
03:40:15,180 --> 03:40:16,879
Not necessarily

1878
03:40:16,879 --> 03:40:18,719
Just answer the next question

1879
03:40:18,719 --> 03:40:20,719
What did you do before you rode a dragon?

1880
03:40:23,649 --> 03:40:27,489
Uh, I think he was doing a simpsons thing

1881
03:40:28,049 --> 03:40:33,379
And then I turned into being inside of a dragon. I don't know what were a new a nuclear

1882
03:40:33,860 --> 03:40:42,530
Worker, what did you do before you rode a dragon drove down its throat?

1883
03:40:43,170 --> 03:40:59,620
I drove down a dragon's throat. Ernie throws her hands into the air

1884
03:41:10,540 --> 03:41:18,590
Hi birds. Oh, she's stuck. She's stuck. She can't move

1885
03:41:24,420 --> 03:41:26,430
Uh-oh, come on

1886
03:41:26,430 --> 03:41:33,440
Give us something. Come on. Do it. It's thinking so hard

1887
03:41:35,620 --> 03:41:52,879
Okay, i'll do it too. Ernie throws her hands into the air. You throw your hands into the air

1888
03:41:53,200 --> 03:41:55,200
Ernie looks at you with a look of disbelief

1889
03:41:55,200 --> 03:41:59,500
This is hopeless if you can't even tell me when i'm joking and when i'm not

1890
03:42:00,860 --> 03:42:04,299
Wait, if you can't tell when i'm joking when I so this has been like a just a

1891
03:42:04,700 --> 03:42:26,829
Ha, I know you're a dragon rider. I'm just kidding. I knew it was a joke. Why didn't you know I was joking?

1892
03:42:32,559 --> 03:42:36,079
You say ha ha ha ha ha ha Ernie frowns at you. I'm not laughing

1893
03:42:36,719 --> 03:42:44,299
She turns away from you and stares at the walls of the dragon's stomach. You know

1894
03:42:45,469 --> 03:42:47,469
How to get out of here?

1895
03:42:54,139 --> 03:43:00,899
Being gaslit by an npc something like that Ernie looks at you and raises an eyebrow

1896
03:43:01,979 --> 03:43:03,500
Of course I do

1897
03:43:03,500 --> 03:43:15,729
And let's go

1898
03:43:15,729 --> 03:43:26,930
Not so fast. I want your word that you will take me with you when we get out of here have my word

1899
03:43:29,790 --> 03:43:31,309
She's so fucked

1900
03:43:31,309 --> 03:43:41,149
Good enough Ernie turns away from you and begins scanning the walls for a way out

1901
03:43:41,709 --> 03:43:43,709
She looks up at one of the holes in the ceiling

1902
03:43:44,270 --> 03:43:57,649
Is that big enough?

1903
03:43:57,649 --> 03:44:01,950
Maybe begins looking around for something to stand on. What are you doing?

1904
03:44:02,590 --> 03:44:04,690
Looking for something to stand on

1905
03:44:04,690 --> 03:44:19,139
Why so why can't get up there? You're not strong enough to pull yourself up there. I'll figure out a way

1906
03:44:19,620 --> 03:44:47,040
She looks around some more. I can't believe you can't tell what i'm joking Ernie turns to you surprised

1907
03:44:47,809 --> 03:44:49,809
I thought you said you wouldn't make any more jokes

1908
03:44:54,940 --> 03:45:09,700
All I know how to do Ernie. I'm sorry. Can you take anything seriously?

1909
03:45:09,860 --> 03:45:19,340
I'm trying to Ernie smiles at you then turns away. What is the lead?

1910
03:45:28,739 --> 03:45:40,559
Ernie looks up at the hole of the ceiling surface. I hope is there any way of telling climb?

1911
03:45:44,770 --> 03:45:50,049
Uh climb on climb the truck, right? We can move we can I can we put it in neutral climb the truck

1912
03:45:51,010 --> 03:45:53,010
and get into

1913
03:45:53,010 --> 03:46:06,219
the hole

1914
03:46:06,219 --> 03:46:07,979
Climb the truck and get into the hole

1915
03:46:07,979 --> 03:46:12,620
You crawl out of the dragon's mouth and find yourself in the middle of a vast snow-covered plane. It's a beautiful day

1916
03:46:14,860 --> 03:46:24,500
Reckon you turn around and crawl back into the dragon's mouth

1917
03:46:24,579 --> 03:46:28,100
You climb down from the truck and stand up inside the dragon's belly

1918
03:46:28,579 --> 03:46:33,940
Trucks lies on the floor of the cavern clearly dead. No, not my truck trucks trucky the truck

1919
03:46:34,500 --> 03:46:42,129
I found

1920
03:46:42,129 --> 03:46:45,010
Away it leads it leads it leads

1921
03:46:45,809 --> 03:46:54,899
out of his mouth

1922
03:46:54,899 --> 03:46:56,420
I know that

1923
03:46:56,420 --> 03:46:59,700
His mouth is very small. I don't think it's meant for people to go in and out of

1924
03:47:05,170 --> 03:47:07,489
Any uh, any uh, any other ideas?

1925
03:47:11,219 --> 03:47:16,850
I just came in and out

1926
03:47:16,850 --> 03:47:21,299
None you begin to panic you sit down next to the corpse of the man who tried to help you

1927
03:47:21,940 --> 03:47:32,049
Well, I guess this is it then

1928
03:47:32,049 --> 03:47:35,790
Can't we go?

1929
03:47:35,790 --> 03:47:37,469
Another way

1930
03:47:37,469 --> 03:47:48,700
I've explored this entire continent. There's no other way

1931
03:47:49,340 --> 03:47:51,739
You slump to the ground staring at the hole in the wall

1932
03:48:03,069 --> 03:48:05,280
continent

1933
03:48:05,280 --> 03:48:06,159
Okay

1934
03:48:06,159 --> 03:48:08,079
climb through

1935
03:48:08,079 --> 03:48:10,399
the hole

1936
03:48:10,399 --> 03:48:24,379
with perney

1937
03:48:24,379 --> 03:48:39,229
And climb through the hole doesn't know what to do. Try it again. This stream is so fucked

1938
03:48:41,459 --> 03:48:42,340
uh

1939
03:48:42,340 --> 03:48:43,540
Thanks, man

1940
03:48:43,540 --> 03:48:49,139
Climb through the hole with perney you crawl out of the dragon's mouth and you find yourself in the middle of a vast snow-covered plane

1941
03:48:49,139 --> 03:48:58,510
It's a beautiful day

1942
03:48:58,510 --> 03:49:00,670
kick her back in just like

1943
03:49:01,229 --> 03:49:04,829
Sparta kick her back into the mouth. Why is the mouth just open?

1944
03:49:05,389 --> 03:49:10,239
No, I know what we can do

1945
03:49:10,239 --> 03:49:12,239
Take out a marker

1946
03:49:13,469 --> 03:49:15,709
and draw a funny mustache

1947
03:49:17,620 --> 03:49:37,540
on the dragon

1948
03:49:37,540 --> 03:49:40,420
You take out a marker and draw a funny mustache on the dragon

1949
03:49:41,059 --> 03:49:45,299
Trucks lies on the floor of the cavern clearly dead you pick him up and throw him down the hole

1950
03:49:45,780 --> 03:49:47,780
You hear him hit the ground a few seconds later

1951
03:49:48,260 --> 03:49:54,020
What are you doing here?

1952
03:49:54,770 --> 03:49:56,770
Draw a funny

1953
03:49:57,170 --> 03:49:58,899
Mustache

1954
03:49:58,899 --> 03:50:00,340
on the dragon

1955
03:50:00,340 --> 03:50:08,020
Here take this marker

1956

Ernie shrugs him because drawing a mustache on the dragon

1961
03:50:51,760 --> 03:50:55,649
Two of you crawl through the tunnel for what seems like an eternity

1962
03:51:02,129 --> 03:51:03,899
Go buy

1963
03:51:03,899 --> 03:51:05,819
a funny hat

1964
03:51:05,819 --> 03:51:07,950
at the store

1965
03:51:07,950 --> 03:51:10,350
And put it on the dragon's head

1966
03:51:11,149 --> 03:51:23,360
Okay, why are we going back in?

1967
03:51:23,360 --> 03:51:27,200
Buy a funny hat at the store and put it on the dragon's head perney looks at you and begins to laugh

1968
03:51:27,760 --> 03:51:29,360
That's really funny

1969
03:51:29,360 --> 03:51:41,760
If you crawl through the tunnel for what seems like an eternity crawling

1970
03:51:47,309 --> 03:51:49,309
Blow up the tunnel

1971
03:51:49,870 --> 03:51:52,299
Okay, i'm gonna plant c4 on the ground

1972
03:51:55,219 --> 03:51:59,540
Crawl through the tunnel for what feels like an eternity soon. You find yourself out of the tunnel. You're standing on a sidewalk

1973
03:52:00,180 --> 03:52:18,639
You plant c4 in the tunnel you press a button on your watch and the entire tunnel explodes

1974
03:52:19,120 --> 03:52:21,120
You and perney are thrown across the room

1975
03:52:21,520 --> 03:52:23,520
Haha, that was great

1976
03:52:23,600 --> 03:52:27,950
Okay, leave the tunnel

1977
03:52:28,510 --> 03:52:43,219
You leave the tunnel you walk outside the building and begin walking down the road. Where are we?

1978
03:52:43,860 --> 03:52:45,860
I don't know. I've never been here before have you?

1979
03:52:46,340 --> 03:52:51,540
Yeah, I want to look for the dragon to see if he's see if I like

1980
03:52:52,180 --> 03:52:57,329
Blew him up. I never been here before have you i've never left my house

1981
03:52:58,129 --> 03:53:00,129
I guess it's new to both of us

1982
03:53:00,290 --> 03:53:03,010
You look around you're in a city surrounded by high-rise buildings

1983
03:53:03,729 --> 03:53:09,389
Where's the dragon?

1984
03:53:09,389 --> 03:53:22,700
We're not in springfield anymore

1985
03:53:28,020 --> 03:53:30,340
I think it's because it did you look right? Yes

1986
03:53:31,219 --> 03:53:33,299
You do look for the dragon not you look

1987
03:53:35,620 --> 03:53:38,899
Get out of here perney shrieks the two of you walk around the city marveling and everything around you

1988
03:53:42,670 --> 03:53:44,670
attempt to attach

1989
03:53:44,969 --> 03:53:47,819
yourself

1990
03:53:47,819 --> 03:53:49,819
to a building

1991
03:53:49,979 --> 03:53:51,739
with your hands

1992
03:53:51,739 --> 03:54:06,899
You attempt to attach yourself to a building with your hands you find yourself swinging through the air

1993
03:54:07,540 --> 03:54:11,139
After a few minutes of this you land on another building. I'm never doing that again

1994
03:54:17,040 --> 03:54:19,120
Go back down to perney

1995
03:54:24,350 --> 03:54:26,030
He's retired

1996
03:54:26,030 --> 03:54:30,319
Walk over to perney who is sitting on the street

1997
03:54:30,879 --> 03:54:32,780
What's going on?

1998
03:54:32,780 --> 03:54:35,100
Me legs hurt from walking around so much

1999
03:54:45,180 --> 03:54:45,979
and

2000
03:54:45,979 --> 03:54:51,920
It's so funny when the ai just doesn't know what else to do

2001
03:54:52,719 --> 03:54:55,860
It tries it's sitting there going fuck. All right

2002
03:54:56,500 --> 03:54:59,620
What am I pulling from here? What am I gonna do here?

2003
03:55:00,420 --> 03:55:03,139
It's got like trillions of days of content

2004
03:55:03,700 --> 03:55:07,729
Can we take a break?

2005
03:55:07,729 --> 03:55:09,629
Sure

2006
03:55:09,629 --> 03:55:11,899
Sit down next to perney

2007
03:55:11,899 --> 03:55:14,299
Do you know where we are? No, do you yeah?

2008
03:55:16,530 --> 03:55:18,209
We are in

2009
03:55:18,209 --> 03:55:22,020
metropolis

2010
03:55:22,020 --> 03:55:24,020
of the old

2011
03:55:24,180 --> 03:55:25,219

2012
03:55:25,219 --> 03:55:28,420

2013
03:55:29,219 --> 03:55:35,659
Of the old round lake that's where we are

2014
03:55:36,299 --> 03:55:46,690
How do you know that I can see signs?

2015
03:55:48,700 --> 03:55:50,860
bad name

2016
03:55:50,860 --> 03:56:01,700
I was making it up on the spot to make perney think I knew anything. That's what the place is called by the way

2017
03:56:13,819 --> 03:56:15,500
Can you not read?

2018
03:56:15,500 --> 03:56:16,770
No

2019
03:56:16,770 --> 03:56:18,770
You look at perney. He's staring at his feet

2020
03:56:19,579 --> 03:56:21,020
I want to go home

2021
03:56:21,020 --> 03:56:31,569
Was it wait and just take the bus

I don't have any money. Neither do I maybe we can find something to trade. Okay, go

2023
03:56:44,860 --> 03:56:47,020

2024
03:56:47,020 --> 03:56:49,020
one of the alleys

03:56:49,340 --> 03:56:56,829

03:56:57,090 --> 03:56:59,090
I don't have any bitcoin. Here we go

2027
03:56:59,329 --> 03:57:05,889
To explore one of the alleys you see a merchant standing outside of his shop putting up a sign that says demons for sale

2028
03:57:06,530 --> 03:57:15,760
The merchant looks up at you and sees you go away. Can you steal a demon? What kinds?

2029
03:57:16,319 --> 03:57:18,319
What kinds of demons do you have?

That's it. I'm out of here. You walk away from the guy

2034
03:57:37,729 --> 03:57:39,729
Come back. He screams

2035
03:57:43,229 --> 03:57:56,620
Turn and go back

2036
03:57:56,620 --> 03:57:59,649

Kill it and i'll give you anything you want. I want up front payment

2039
03:58:24,450 --> 03:58:27,409

2040
03:58:28,399 --> 03:58:31,120
Because i've not this i've got two killed i've done twice

2041
03:58:39,139 --> 03:58:41,860
Uh, I didn't like that. Hold on you turn away. Hey the dragon killer

2042
03:58:42,860 --> 03:58:45,180

2045
03:58:57,739 --> 03:59:07,780
Fine. Here's some money more when you kill the dragon bernie is just staring at you. This is not enough

2046
03:59:17,979 --> 03:59:20,219
Are you crazy? That's a lot of money

2047
03:59:21,040 --> 03:59:22,559
Not for killing a dragon

2048
03:59:22,559 --> 03:59:33,889
You're not getting any more now if you don't want to work for me, that's fine

2049
03:59:33,889 --> 03:59:38,180
There are other adventurers who will you look at the merchant and at bernie?

2050
03:59:38,739 --> 04:00:02,139
Hmm, okay, if you give me one of those demons

2051
04:00:04,159 --> 04:00:24,989
Got a deal. The merchant goes back into his shop. He comes out with a small black creature

2052
04:00:25,469 --> 04:00:51,860
Ours doesn't have it can make you invisible look into its eyes and twist the ring on its tail. Look at the creature

2053
04:00:54,299 --> 04:00:56,590
Okay, twist

2054
04:00:56,590 --> 04:00:58,590
the ring on the creature's

2055
04:01:00,139 --> 04:01:24,610
Tail i'm looking at it right now. Come on. Come on

2056
04:01:30,000 --> 04:01:38,500
You twist is this the avengers you twist the ring on the creature's tail

2057
04:01:38,500 --> 04:01:46,940
The demon disappears you now see yourself holding nothing, but the merchant still sees you holding the demon you walk outside

2058
04:01:47,100 --> 04:02:00,659
Where's the demon when it makes the demon invisible? I want a different demon

2059
04:02:01,379 --> 04:02:04,829
only invisible to me

2060
04:02:08,110 --> 04:02:11,309
He goes back inside and comes back with a big red creature

2061
04:02:12,770 --> 04:02:15,969
What does this one do that is fucking useless?

2062
04:02:17,700 --> 04:02:24,340
So I look into its eyes and twist its ring and it makes it invisible to me but not other people

2063
04:02:25,600 --> 04:02:28,079
What's the point of that just so it can like fuck with me?

2064
04:02:28,639 --> 04:02:36,059
I can come to my house and like mess up all my clothes in my laundry room and shit and then leave and no

2065
04:02:36,379 --> 04:02:37,739
I don't understand

2066
04:02:37,739 --> 04:02:50,719
It's a big red creature. What does this one do? I don't know nothing probably

2067
04:02:51,280 --> 04:02:53,280
It's not even alive just painted

2068
04:02:54,430 --> 04:02:56,430
You stare at the merchant. He stares back

2069
04:02:59,200 --> 04:03:01,540

Your dragon wakes up and eagerly awaits her meal

04:09:15,819 --> 04:09:26,639
You stand still the dragon breathes fire all over you

2123

2124
04:09:31,729 --> 04:09:33,729
What was my goal?

2125
04:09:34,719 --> 04:09:39,010
I'm being cooked

2126
04:09:39,489 --> 04:09:51,899
Uh dragon breathes fire all over you after it stops after it stops you look at your hand

2127
04:09:52,379 --> 04:09:54,659
It's completely black

2128

I need a new hand you rip off your blackened hand and throw it on the ground

2129
04:10:03,889 --> 04:10:07,010
God

2130
04:10:07,010 --> 04:10:09,010
I want a new hand

2131
04:10:09,010 --> 04:10:10,850
Your mother runs into the room

2132
04:10:10,850 --> 04:10:12,129
What happened?

2133
04:10:12,129 --> 04:10:14,129
The dragon burned my hand off

2134
04:10:14,850 --> 04:10:23,360
I hope the dragon gets grounded for a week

2135
04:10:24,079 --> 04:10:26,829
You cry

2136
04:10:26,829 --> 04:10:28,670

You take the new hand. Thanks mom your mother nods be careful

2138
04:10:40,000 --> 04:10:56,000
She didn't say it was attached

2139
04:10:56,000 --> 04:10:58,000
Stare at the dragon the dragon stares back

2140
04:10:58,979 --> 04:11:00,979
What are you looking at?

2141
04:11:00,979 --> 04:11:04,510
You continue to stare. Hi, man. Don't talk to me

2142
04:11:10,700 --> 04:11:16,430
Uh upper cut it's not gonna work. It's a dragon

2143
04:11:23,180 --> 04:11:24,930
Ride the dragon

2144
04:11:24,930 --> 04:11:26,930
Can I ride you?

2145
04:11:27,170 --> 04:11:29,250
Oh, yeah, right. That's what I want to do that for the very beginning

2146
04:11:34,239 --> 04:11:36,239
Use the ps2 board game

2147
04:11:36,700 --> 04:11:38,700
Dragon shakes its head. No

2148
04:11:39,020 --> 04:11:41,020
Why not you'll fall and get hurt

2149
04:11:41,659 --> 04:11:54,850
But I want to ride you

2150
04:11:54,850 --> 04:11:56,850
I am very strong. I can handle it

2151
04:11:57,250 --> 04:12:06,139
Here we go

2152
04:12:06,139 --> 04:12:11,340
Fine. The dragon walks over to you. You climb onto its back. It takes off into the sky. Whee

2153
04:12:41,899 --> 04:12:45,969
Okay head towards the city

2154
04:12:46,850 --> 04:12:57,950
You head towards the city the dragon the dragon takes you higher into the sky

2155
04:12:58,030 --> 04:13:01,149
You can see the entire countryside you spot another kingdom

2156
04:13:02,530 --> 04:13:03,809
Can we go there?

2157
04:13:03,809 --> 04:13:11,149
The dragon shakes her head

2158
04:13:11,149 --> 04:13:14,059
Is it a yes or a no?

2159
04:13:14,059 --> 04:13:15,020
Yes

2160
04:13:15,020 --> 04:13:25,709
Dragon shakes her head

2161
04:13:25,709 --> 04:13:30,479
Why not the dragon doesn't respond she takes you home instead. Come on. I'm hungry

2162
04:13:45,090 --> 04:13:47,090
You can eat me if you want

2163
04:13:47,250 --> 04:13:52,610
No, I want to live the dragon shrugs and goes to the kitchen. You follow her you see your mother cooking dinner

2164
04:13:53,409 --> 04:13:59,760
How big is this dragon?

2165
04:13:59,760 --> 04:14:09,809
The dinner the dragon is the mom

2166
04:14:13,819 --> 04:14:19,260
You look at the dinner. It looks delicious. There's mashed potatoes gravy roast beef buttered carrots and corn

2167
04:14:20,739 --> 04:14:27,760
Pickled cucumbers your mother says noticing you looking at them. That sounds really good

2168
04:14:28,479 --> 04:14:52,719
I wish I could eat that right now. I want something else. This looks icky

2169
04:14:54,559 --> 04:14:57,149
What do you want then?

2170
04:14:57,149 --> 04:14:58,590
I don't know

2171
04:14:58,590 --> 04:15:23,659
You see a bottle of ketchup is drinking ketchup. You squeeze the bottle of ketchup into your mouth

2172
04:15:24,299 --> 04:15:26,299
You immediately spit it out

2173
04:15:27,090 --> 04:15:28,940
What is that stuff?

2174
04:15:28,940 --> 04:15:52,879
Ketchup it's horrible. I want something else. No, you'll eat what we have for dinner and you'll like it. No, I won't

2175
04:15:54,799 --> 04:16:19,979
I want captain crunch. We don't have any captain crunch. We have oatmeal. I don't like oatmeal fine

2176
04:16:19,979 --> 04:16:39,969
And no oatmeal then I want two hot dogs and mac and cheese your mother sighs

2177
04:16:41,659 --> 04:17:01,299
Fine, my mother turns away and gets you some dinner. You sit down at the table. I want three hot dogs

2178
04:17:01,860 --> 04:17:12,299
another size

2179
04:17:12,299 --> 04:17:15,899
Fine your mother makes some more hot dogs and sits down with you to eat them

2180
04:17:16,219 --> 04:17:40,299
You eat as fast as you can making piggy noises. You eat all the hot dogs. Then you look at your mother

2181
04:17:40,940 --> 04:17:42,940
I'm still hungry

2182
04:17:48,590 --> 04:17:50,590
Dragon still outside

2183
04:17:53,889 --> 04:17:58,850
Your mother laughs i'm still hungry me too. Your mother laughs there's more in the kitchen

2184
04:17:59,729 --> 04:18:02,049
But go back into the kitchen and see a plate of bacon

2185
04:18:02,930 --> 04:18:04,290
I want that

2186
04:18:04,290 --> 04:18:19,250
You eat all the bacon now. You're really full

2187
04:18:20,899 --> 04:18:22,899
I don't want to go upstairs

2188
04:18:22,979 --> 04:18:25,139
Okay, you sit down and watch tv with your mom

2189
04:18:26,270 --> 04:18:32,340
next day

2190
04:18:32,340 --> 04:18:35,729
Ask my mom

2191
04:18:37,420 --> 04:18:38,459
make

2192
04:18:38,459 --> 04:18:40,459
The mac and cheese

2193
04:18:40,620 --> 04:18:53,940
You ask your mom to make you mac and cheese

2194
04:18:54,579 --> 04:18:56,850
Do it yourself

2195
04:18:56,850 --> 04:19:01,250
You go to the kitchen. You see a box of macaroni on the counter. I can make it myself

2196
04:19:14,000 --> 04:19:15,760
Turn on every burner

2197
04:19:15,760 --> 04:19:18,829
Unfortunately, they are all electric. You can't turn them on

2198
04:19:20,479 --> 04:19:22,479
Why didn't mom have gas ones?

2199
04:19:23,280 --> 04:19:26,690
You look in the cupboard

2200
04:19:26,690 --> 04:19:29,090
Find a gas stove in the cupboard

2201
04:19:29,889 --> 04:19:33,379
now

2202
04:19:33,379 --> 04:19:40,420
Mac and cheese

2203
04:19:40,420 --> 04:19:42,420
No, I gotta do this right

2204
04:19:43,870 --> 04:19:45,579

2205
04:19:45,579 --> 04:19:46,780

2206
04:19:46,780 --> 04:19:55,379
And then you put the macaroni in water heats up. Yes

2207
04:19:56,020 --> 04:20:00,180
You turn off the stove and quickly open the box of macaroni. You put some in the water and wait done

2208
04:20:04,860 --> 04:20:05,899
drain

2209
04:20:05,899 --> 04:20:07,739
the macaroni

2210
04:20:07,739 --> 04:20:19,899
Drain the macaroni you grab a fork and sit down at the table. You see your mom walk in

2211
04:20:20,459 --> 04:20:21,899

2212
04:20:21,899 --> 04:20:23,100
eating

2213
04:20:23,100 --> 04:20:27,870
You didn't think

2214
04:20:27,870 --> 04:20:30,350
I could do it on my own

2215
04:20:30,909 --> 04:20:32,190
Did you?

2216
04:20:32,190 --> 04:20:45,709
Don't have any cheese in it. You didn't think I could do it on my own. Did you no your mom sits down to eat

2217
04:20:46,350 --> 04:21:07,899
How do you plan on winning the quest? I don't even know what the quest is

2218
04:21:08,700 --> 04:21:12,350
You can't have any there's some stale bread on the counter

2219
04:21:13,739 --> 04:21:14,780
Thanks

2220
04:21:14,780 --> 04:21:16,940
You eat the macaroni. It's delicious that night

2221
04:21:17,420 --> 04:21:40,579
You demand more mac and cheese from your mother. No, you go to bed hungry the next morning. I'm hungry

2222
04:21:40,579 --> 04:21:42,579
Your mom hands you a bag of chips

2223
04:21:43,059 --> 04:21:51,260
What's the meme?

2224
04:21:51,260 --> 04:21:56,079
What's the meme?

2225
04:21:56,079 --> 04:21:58,079
Knock the bag of chips out of her hand

2226
04:22:04,110 --> 04:22:11,409
You pissed her off

2227
04:22:11,409 --> 04:22:15,329
You knock the bag of chicks out of chips out of her hand. I want real food

2228
04:22:16,639 --> 04:22:18,559
I'm hungry now

2229
04:22:18,559 --> 04:22:36,510
Your mom sighs fine. She goes to the kitchen. I want chicken tenders

2230
04:22:36,989 --> 04:22:42,030
No, you see your mom makes some eggs you could have this and like it you sit down and eat

2231
04:22:42,750 --> 04:22:55,979

Your mom sighs and gets you some more food you throw the eggs into the trash

2235
04:23:27,489 --> 04:23:32,610
Your mom walks in. Why did you do that? I didn't want them you go to the living room

2236
04:23:36,030 --> 04:23:37,950
This is cartman

2237
04:23:37,950 --> 04:23:53,379
I want to see if anything else adds on top of this

2238
04:23:58,270 --> 04:24:00,270
Okay, you go into the living room

2239
04:24:07,629 --> 04:24:15,299
We have any soda

2240
04:24:15,299 --> 04:24:17,700
No, now stop asking questions and go watch tv

2241
04:24:18,879 --> 04:24:21,120
Watch tv for a while then you go back to the kitchen

2242
04:24:21,760 --> 04:24:43,629
Get the eggs out of the trash and put them on a plate you go back to the living room and watch tv

2243
04:24:43,629 --> 04:24:45,709
Then you go back to the kitchen your mom walks in

2244
04:25:02,180 --> 04:25:04,180
I can't do that. That's that's horrible

2245
04:25:04,739 --> 04:25:26,059
Drop the eggs into the dvd player's cd tray

2246
04:25:26,540 --> 04:25:40,930
I'm just like, oh, i'm just a little brat. Fuck. Yeah, you drop the eggs into the dvd player's cd tray

2247
04:25:41,409 --> 04:25:44,059
Why did you do that for?

2248
04:25:44,059 --> 04:25:46,290
I don't know

2249
04:25:46,290 --> 04:26:11,299
The next day i'm hungry. I want some eggs. I don't have any you go to the refrigerator. I want to eat something

2250
04:26:12,540 --> 04:26:14,540
Your mom hands you a hot dog

2251
04:26:14,620 --> 04:26:25,680
here

2252
04:26:25,680 --> 04:26:28,319
Eat the hot dog in one bite like just the whole thing

2253
04:26:33,489 --> 04:26:34,450
Raw

2254
04:26:34,450 --> 04:26:50,049
You eat the hot dog in one bite. I want something else your mom gives you some apple juice here

2255
04:26:50,129 --> 04:26:52,129
You take a sip. It's extremely sour

2256
04:27:15,739 --> 04:27:17,739
You spit the apple juice into the radiator

2257
04:27:18,379 --> 04:27:20,559
No more

2258
04:27:20,559 --> 04:27:29,489
Your mom sighs and goes to the kitchen you follow her she gets you a package of macaroni. What happened to the other characters?

2259
04:27:30,129 --> 04:27:36,000
Where are my friends?

2260
04:27:36,000 --> 04:27:47,680
They're in school you go watch tv then you go back to the kitchen then you go back to the living room that night

2261
04:27:48,079 --> 04:27:58,000
Sneak out the window

2262
04:27:58,000 --> 04:28:13,280
I'm too dumb for school you sneak out the window you climb down the tree and run into the woods

2263
04:28:13,760 --> 04:28:17,360
You turn around and look at your house. It's normal a little fixer-upper, but nothing too bad

2264
04:28:26,780 --> 04:28:28,909
house flipper

2265
04:28:28,909 --> 04:28:31,229
Start doing start doing additions to the house

2266
04:28:31,870 --> 04:28:52,940
Don't knock down a wall at your house. You walk back and begin to take pieces of sheetrock off the walls

2267
04:28:53,420 --> 04:28:55,659
You can feel the world changing color around you

2268
04:29:11,149 --> 04:29:13,409
What um somebody said asbestos

2269
04:29:19,280 --> 04:29:22,959
You add a fourth bathroom to your home you open up all the walls in the house

2270
04:29:23,520 --> 04:29:25,920
And see the in in the distance you can feel it changing

2271
04:29:34,280 --> 04:29:45,190
Ask mom if she likes the new look you see her walk in and shriek

2272
04:29:45,670 --> 04:29:48,639
What's happened?

2273
04:29:48,639 --> 04:29:51,280
She looks around and begins to buckle it's over

2274
04:29:52,079 --> 04:30:19,430
I painted the walls macaroni and cheese yellow mom sits down against the wall. It's over. She begins to weep. It's all over

2275
04:30:25,569 --> 04:30:27,940
Um sit down

2276
04:30:27,940 --> 04:30:39,360
It'll be okay

2277
04:30:39,360 --> 04:30:41,360
No, it won't it's all gone

2278
04:30:41,360 --> 04:30:44,399
We will still have each other. It should have been better than this

2279
04:30:45,040 --> 04:31:13,319
Reject reality. All right, this one's gonna have to this is gonna come to an end raid the fridge

2280
04:31:13,319 --> 04:31:15,959
You open up the too tired to stand. There's nothing much in there

2281
04:31:16,440 --> 04:31:33,879
Just some bottle of water and a few cans of coca-cola. Yeah, let's go share a coke with mom

2282
04:31:41,250 --> 04:31:47,559
Hand her a bottle to us and to the future. She looks at you. There's a glint in her eye

2283
04:31:55,540 --> 04:31:56,500
Cheers

2284
04:31:56,500 --> 04:32:12,549
Take a swig. It's really bad. Isn't it? Yep, you finish the coca-cola in silence. Then you go back to bed

2285
04:32:12,950 --> 04:32:23,190
All right. I have to leave this house the end. I shared a coke with mom

2286
04:32:28,229 --> 04:32:31,190
It's really bad. Well, this is yeah, that's not a coke ad

2287
04:32:31,750 --> 04:32:34,739
It's a rival brand ad

2288
04:32:34,739 --> 04:32:43,090
Hey mom wanted to say

2289
04:32:43,090 --> 04:32:44,420

04:33:26,880 --> 04:33:33,279
big egg salad with a big cook and

2293
04:33:33,819 --> 04:33:46,610
Elaborate dinner for mom. No mayo here. Yeah, that's fucked up

2294
04:33:47,090 --> 04:33:55,430
You head down to the grocery store to get some groceries you pick up some apples

2295
04:33:55,990 --> 04:33:59,029
A rotisserie chicken and a box of macaroni and cheese

2296
04:33:59,349 --> 04:34:25,189
You're the mom now grab a bottle of mayo you go to the cashier the cashier eyes you disapprovingly then scans your groceries

2297
04:34:25,189 --> 04:34:42,610
That'll be 25 36. Uh, go fuck yourself

2298
04:34:43,009 --> 04:34:48,150
Any change you get your change and head out the door you go back home and put the groceries away

2299
04:34:52,950 --> 04:34:54,150
pair

2300
04:34:54,150 --> 04:35:06,930
Dinner for mom. Yep. Sounds about retail. Yeah prepare dinner for mom

2301
04:35:07,409 --> 04:35:12,529
You put a pot of water on the stove to boil and open the macaroni box. You empty it into the pot

2302
04:35:16,259 --> 04:35:18,259
add the cheese

2303
04:35:23,540 --> 04:35:25,540
Make it stop. I i've i'm

2304
04:35:25,860 --> 04:35:27,860
I tried to get away from it

2305
04:35:27,860 --> 04:35:33,970
You add the cheese you grab the chicken and put it in the oven. It's ready in half an hour

2306
04:35:34,610 --> 04:35:37,330
You take out two plates from the cabinet and begin to eat

2307
04:35:38,049 --> 04:35:39,490
Wait for mom

2308
04:35:39,490 --> 04:35:52,419
You wait for mom mom comes in and sits down

2309
04:35:53,139 --> 04:35:54,900
Something smells good

2310
04:35:54,900 --> 04:35:57,939
She begins to eat finally some good fucking food

2311
04:35:58,819 --> 04:36:00,819
You both sit and eat in silence

2312
04:36:02,200 --> 04:36:06,200
Then she stops

2313
04:36:06,200 --> 04:36:21,459
Why it's over she puts her face in her hands begins to weep you go over to her. I'm sorry mom

2314
04:36:25,299 --> 04:36:27,479
It isn't over

2315
04:36:27,479 --> 04:36:34,759
Right, like i'm where i'm here. We're here. It isn't over look what you did

2316
04:36:35,400 --> 04:36:44,319
It isn't over. She looks up and smiles. Let's go to the living room

2317
04:36:44,799 --> 04:36:46,799
She picks up her plate and puts it in the sink

2318
04:36:50,000 --> 04:36:58,869
Go to the living room you watch a lot of tv

2319
04:36:59,509 --> 04:37:03,860
We both sit down on the couch. Do you have any idea why this is happening?

2320
04:37:04,500 --> 04:37:06,500
Not a clue. We should get some rest

2321
04:37:10,680 --> 04:37:14,319
Um, um, I have a dragon

2322
04:37:15,270 --> 04:37:25,040
outside

2323
04:37:25,040 --> 04:37:26,869
Begins to laugh

2324
04:37:26,869 --> 04:37:31,830
I'm just joking mom. She picks up a throw pillow from the couch and hits you with it

2325
04:37:32,869 --> 04:37:34,869
Oh, yeah, whatever sport

2326
04:37:36,080 --> 04:37:38,639
Um, I am serious

2327
04:37:41,520 --> 04:37:43,669
dragon

2328
04:37:43,669 --> 04:37:45,669
Is it right outside?

2329
04:37:46,229 --> 04:37:58,099
He chuckles i'll see you in the morning

2330
04:38:01,880 --> 04:38:03,560
Get the dragon

2331
04:38:03,560 --> 04:38:10,470
To come in the house

2332
04:38:10,470 --> 04:38:12,319
ds2 board gamer

2333
04:38:12,319 --> 04:38:15,119
No

2334
04:38:15,119 --> 04:38:17,119
You see you get the dragon to come in the house

2335
04:38:17,439 --> 04:38:22,560
You see a large lizard slithering through the grass towards the front door. You open it and it slinks in okay

2336
04:38:25,880 --> 04:38:26,919
Mom

2337
04:38:26,919 --> 04:38:29,520
Come look

2338
04:38:29,520 --> 04:38:31,119
At the dragon

2339
04:38:31,119 --> 04:38:44,099
But it's not it's a lizard

2340
04:38:44,180 --> 04:38:45,939
You say

2341
04:38:45,939 --> 04:38:49,119
Hey mom, come look at the dragon. She walks over and screams

2342
04:38:49,840 --> 04:38:51,520
It's a dragon

2343
04:38:51,520 --> 04:38:59,270
She runs into the kitchen. You hear the sound of her opening the freezer. What's in the freezer?

2344
04:38:59,669 --> 04:39:05,270
I hope she takes out a she comes back holding a tray of ice cubes. The dragon looks at her annoyed

2345
04:39:05,909 --> 04:39:10,150
She throws the ice cubes at the dragon which slides away on its belly to avoid them

2346
04:39:10,790 --> 04:39:18,599
There is some logic behind this

2347
04:39:19,240 --> 04:39:25,270
Because if the dragon is fire, you know, that's that's like the stupidest logic ever right?

2348
04:39:25,430 --> 04:39:32,400
But it's there kind of the ai is trying hey mom stop

2349
04:39:40,919 --> 04:39:44,639
Why we need to help the dragon? What's it gonna do eat us?

2350
04:39:47,040 --> 04:40:14,000
Tell the dragon to eat mom the dragon opens its mouth and roars your mother looks down dejected

2351
04:40:14,759 --> 04:40:29,110
I'll never be free. Will I i'm sorry mom it was

2352
04:40:30,639 --> 04:40:58,389
Just a joke a prank. Why am I such a shitty child? That's a really good question

2353
04:40:58,630 --> 04:41:06,479
Are you perny where the fuck is perny? She looks at you. I know I know it's okay

2354
04:41:06,560 --> 04:41:13,200
You'd never hurt me on purpose. So imagine a mother hugging her son the next morning

2355
04:41:13,439 --> 04:41:29,250
I've got to get away from like weird child and mom arc of this story

2356
04:41:29,409 --> 04:41:31,250
This one's been going on for like an hour

2357
04:41:31,250 --> 04:41:35,319
You look for mom you search the house, but she's nowhere to be found

2358
04:41:35,319 --> 04:41:50,790
The back door is wide open you walk outside and look around mom you look around but she's gone

2359
04:41:51,029 --> 04:41:53,029
You have no idea where she went

2360
04:41:58,020 --> 04:42:06,529
Ask the dragon ask the dragon where your mom is

2361
04:42:07,090 --> 04:42:21,080
You ask the dragon where your mom is the dragon looks at you confused and it shrugs and goes back to sleep

2362
04:42:21,400 --> 04:42:24,040
You stand there for a while waiting for it to do something

2363
04:42:28,790 --> 04:42:30,549
You eat my mother

2364
04:42:30,549 --> 04:42:41,560
The dragon looks at you annoyed

2365
04:42:41,880 --> 04:42:45,959
It opens his mouth and flame shoots out it burns your arm and you begin to feel faint

2366
04:42:51,299 --> 04:43:01,830
Did you eat her dragon says something in its strange language?

2367
04:43:02,639 --> 04:43:06,080
You see a flash of your house in the distance a woman stands in front of it screaming

2368
04:43:06,400 --> 04:43:18,159
You run towards it, but the dragon flies in front of you. It looks at you annoyed

2369
04:43:18,639 --> 04:43:24,200
You scream as the house is consumed by a ball of flame finally the pain stops

2370
04:43:45,540 --> 04:43:50,709
Raid the fridge and open a beer. It's pretty gross, but you manage to finish it

2371
04:43:50,709 --> 04:43:54,069
You go to sleep at the end. It's supposed to be like six

2372
04:44:00,549 --> 04:44:04,069
All right. I'm i'm out of here. I'm done. I can't do anymore

2373
04:44:04,549 --> 04:44:09,299
It's been almost five hours. I don't I don't think my brain can handle any more of this

2374
04:44:09,939 --> 04:44:17,299
That was a very long simpsons episode. Yes

2375
04:44:21,220 --> 04:44:22,979
Say epilogue

2376
04:44:22,979 --> 04:44:28,209
Fine. I'm just curious

2377
04:44:30,680 --> 04:44:33,360
My mommy's

2378
04:44:33,439 --> 04:44:36,400
My chest is killing me right now. Let me be honest because of that

2379
04:44:37,119 --> 04:44:39,360
It was two or three things today that seriously it was just

2380
04:44:40,419 --> 04:44:43,779
Um, I I hurt myself. I like broke my penis

2381
04:44:45,400 --> 04:44:48,599
And I swear to god i'm not trying to be like funny. This is not like a funny joke

2382
04:44:48,680 --> 04:44:51,639
I actually was in the bathroom laughing so hard while taking a piss

2383
04:44:52,740 --> 04:44:54,979
I like i've hurt myself today

2384
04:44:56,049 --> 04:45:06,529
Like it was I was laughing too hard going to the bathroom. I just kept going over and over and over again in my head

2385
04:45:06,610 --> 04:45:08,849
What was happening? It was the panther thing

2386
04:45:19,430 --> 04:45:21,430
Accidental self-inflicted. Okay

2387
04:45:22,229 --> 04:45:26,310
There is no epilogue

2388
04:45:26,310 --> 04:45:32,610
What a quote. Oh, okay

2389
04:45:32,610 --> 04:45:35,040
Yeah, I gotta eat something

2390
04:45:35,040 --> 04:45:38,759
And i'm gonna get going

2391
04:45:38,759 --> 04:45:40,759
Oh, that was a ton of fun though

2392
04:45:41,090 --> 04:45:42,450
It always is

2393
04:45:42,450 --> 04:45:45,720
And i'm glad that it's been a full five hours. I knew it was gonna happen

2394
04:45:46,200 --> 04:45:48,580
A new eternal darkness was just not gonna happen

2395
04:45:49,139 --> 04:45:58,770
Epilogue didn't work. So I will see you guys

2396
04:45:59,810 --> 04:46:01,810
On I have some doctor's stuff to do

2397
04:46:02,369 --> 04:46:04,610
Over these next couple of days

2398
04:46:04,689 --> 04:46:07,250
But you will see me again

2399
04:46:07,250 --> 04:46:08,849
on friday

2400
04:46:08,849 --> 04:46:11,139
See on friday

2401
04:46:11,139 --> 04:46:14,099
We're going to do

2402
04:46:14,099 --> 04:46:15,299
um

2403
04:46:15,299 --> 04:46:17,479
Eternal darkness

2404
04:46:17,479 --> 04:46:24,900
And then saturday is the dlc movie night and watch the playlist of a shitload of videos

2405
04:46:25,540 --> 04:46:29,619
We're trying to go through them. The mods are doing a very good job

2406
04:46:30,259 --> 04:46:33,759
But I will say this again because I have to say this every time

2407
04:46:34,759 --> 04:46:38,220
There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions

2408
04:46:38,860 --> 04:46:42,119
If you do not see your video

2409
04:46:42,119 --> 04:46:44,150
I'm, very sorry

2410
04:46:44,150 --> 04:46:46,229
But when you have this many submissions

2411
04:46:47,900 --> 04:46:50,779
We gotta try we gotta try to condense it a little

2412
04:46:51,580 --> 04:46:58,779
Even if I do this over the course of two or three days, it's possibly even thousands of them. Yeah

2413
04:47:00,360 --> 04:47:01,959
Too many people

2414
04:47:01,959 --> 04:47:04,650
Are funny

2415
04:47:04,650 --> 04:47:06,650
And too many people make good videos

2416
04:47:09,750 --> 04:47:13,349
Raid raid joel ray. Yeah. Well, what's he doing? What's joel up to today?

2417
04:47:14,700 --> 04:47:16,700
Go find out what joel is doing

2418
04:47:17,020 --> 04:47:25,459
Rated joel in a while having fun doing rock smith rock smith, huh?

2419
04:47:27,720 --> 04:47:29,590
Isn't that the

2420
04:47:29,590 --> 04:47:31,590
Don't you play a real guitar?

2421
04:47:31,590 --> 04:47:35,590
Wait, isn't guitar wait, isn't rock smith guitar hero people that actually know music?

2422
04:47:44,099 --> 04:47:47,209
I mean, I already like it so far. I was only there for five seconds

2423
04:47:49,959 --> 04:47:52,040
He's actually playing the guitar. All right, that's cool. Yeah

2424
04:47:57,909 --> 04:47:59,349
Uh, let's do the credits

2425
04:47:59,349 --> 04:48:08,150
Thank you again everybody

2426
04:48:08,150 --> 04:48:10,150
Goal raid. Yeah, we will after the credits

2427
04:48:12,360 --> 04:48:15,000
Yeah, I probably i'm gonna I don't think ai dungeon to me

2428
04:48:15,080 --> 04:48:17,080
I feel like you do it for a little while

2429
04:48:17,720 --> 04:48:19,720
And then you have to take a break for a while

2430
04:48:20,040 --> 04:48:22,360
So I don't think we're gonna go back to it for a little while

2431
04:48:23,509 --> 04:48:26,470
I feel like there needs to be a cooldown period because it just gets too wild

2432
04:48:27,110 --> 04:48:32,490
But when we play it, it's a ton of fun. So friday, we're gonna do eternal darkness

2433
04:48:33,049 --> 04:48:40,779
And hopefully I see you there. If not, if it's not part of your schedule, then that's all right

2434
04:48:41,500 --> 04:48:43,669
You never come back to another stream again

2435
04:48:44,229 --> 04:48:48,599
Hey, that's cool, too

2436
04:48:48,599 --> 04:48:57,740
But like, you know, you don't you check out another one sometime, but i'll see you on friday. Let's run the credits right now

2437
04:48:59,959 --> 04:49:02,200
ready three two

2438
04:49:02,840 --> 04:49:07,590
Bring them on all in alphabetical order

2439
04:49:08,229 --> 04:49:15,110
Totally excited to finally watch joel because I was anticipating anticipating the stream

2440
04:49:15,830 --> 04:49:18,979
I feel like that's a good place. That's probably a real pain in the ass to set up

2441
04:49:19,700 --> 04:49:24,919
If you're using a real guitar

2442
04:49:24,919 --> 04:49:29,979
I feel like that's very difficult to do

2443
04:49:32,759 --> 04:49:34,759
A custom song sue. Well, that's awesome

2444
04:49:38,860 --> 04:49:41,099
I should do it. I have no idea how to play the guitar

2445
04:49:42,599 --> 04:49:45,799
My pinky can I can't play guitar hero. My pinky cannot hit the orange button

2446
04:49:46,360 --> 04:49:49,430
I have to play guitar here on medium only

2447
04:49:50,500 --> 04:49:53,060
Because I can only do the three buttons. I can't do four

2448
04:49:58,709 --> 04:50:00,709
Don't use the pinky. I have to

2449
04:50:04,520 --> 04:50:06,419
the drum stream

2450
04:50:06,419 --> 04:50:10,259
I could you know what I could probably really do like a rock band drum stream

2451
04:50:11,540 --> 04:50:15,060
And a lot of you think that I may be messing around but I can do all that stuff on expert

2452
04:50:20,380 --> 04:50:22,380
But I think what I I don't think I can do that though

04:50:22,939 --> 04:50:25,020
All the just the it's just copyright music the stream

2454
04:50:28,310 --> 04:50:39,159
Maybe it's true. Yeah now on twitch now, you're gonna be careful with the copyright stuff

2455
04:50:40,819 --> 04:50:43,990
my understanding

2456
04:50:43,990 --> 04:50:45,830
do custom songs

2457
04:50:45,830 --> 04:50:50,950
That might work for a little while. I don't think I think that might get a little old to me after about six hours though

2458
04:50:55,400 --> 04:51:00,840
Doing just custom songs. I think I feel like if I heard like 85 different remixes the rat song

2459
04:51:01,959 --> 04:51:06,759
I know I feel like I'd probably want to it's like that. What are the songs do I have on this channel?

2460
04:51:08,020 --> 04:51:10,659
It'd be it'd be 40 giant enemy spiders

2461
04:51:11,540 --> 04:51:16,740
30 rat remixes and then the germa craft script with a beat behind it

2462
04:51:17,779 --> 04:51:22,889
That's what I would have to do

2463
04:51:22,889 --> 04:51:24,619
But we'll see you friday

2464
04:51:24,619 --> 04:51:26,229
Thanks for watching guys

2465
04:51:26,229 --> 04:51:28,229
Add on over to joel say hello

2466
04:51:28,229 --> 04:52:31,689
Take care
