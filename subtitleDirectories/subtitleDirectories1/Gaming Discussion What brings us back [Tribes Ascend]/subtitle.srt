00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,820
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Tribes Ascend gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
And you're probably wondering right now, you're probably asking yourself,

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,059
Jerma, we haven't seen a Tribes Ascend video. We haven't even heard of you playing Tribes in, like, five months.

4
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:28,059
What gives? Why are you playing this game? Why are you showing it to us right now?

5
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:33,060
And it is actually the topic of this video to why I'm playing Tribes Ascend.

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,369
But before we get into that at all, I'm gonna tell you the loadout.

7
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,369
Actually, it's only really one different change from the default Pathfinder loadout.

8
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:45,369
Playing as the Pathfinder, like I just said, using the dueling spinfuser.

9
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:50,369
And what this thing does is the more direct you are with your shots, the more damage it's going to do,

10
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:55,369
because it has a smaller splash radius than the typical default spinfuser that you use with the Pathfinder.

11
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:59,369
But anyways, let's talk about what's going on here, why I'm playing the game,

12
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:05,370
why I'm trying to make a case for playing games that you used to play that you've taken breaks from.

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,370
That's the topic. And it's a very important one, because, well, let me start with Tribes Ascend.

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,540
Like I said in the beginning of the video, I haven't played Tribes Ascend in, like, four or five months.

15
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,540
Something like that. Somewhere at least almost half a year.

16
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,540
And when I played Tribes Ascend, I wasn't a huge Tribes guy.

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,540
I didn't, you know, play it every single day. I wasn't that into it.

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,540
But it was fun. And I probably dumped, ah, maybe ten hours into it total.

19
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,540
Ten to twenty hours tops is how much I put into it.

20
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,900
But the point here is, once I stopped playing it,

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,900
I kind of just let it sit on the shelf for a while, haven't really touched it.

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:44,140
Once I took a huge break from that game and came back to it, literally less than two nights ago,

23
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,140
this game is like the funnest thing I've ever done in, like, the last six months.

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,140
Like, it really is. I am in love with this game.

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,140
And I actually had to make a new account to play it,

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,140
because I forgot the password, I forgot the email that was associated with the password.

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,140
So this is a brand new account. Oh, actually, this is,

28
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,140
the gameplay you're watching is probably after three or four hours of playing.

29
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,140
But that's besides the point.

30
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,139
The point is, I don't know what made me want to play this again.

31
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,139
And this is the weird psychology of this whole entire video is,

32
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:16,139
why do we do this? And why do we have so much fun doing this?

33
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,139
Why do we put games on the shelf for months or years at a time,

34
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,439
come back to them, and think it is the best thing that we've ever done?

35
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,439
This has happened to me on multiple games, though.

36
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,439
You see, you probably saw our video a few weeks ago, maybe a month or two ago,

37
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,439
on World of Warcraft, Mists of Pandaria.

38
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,439
I have put that game on the shelf so many times,

39
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,439
and come back to it, than any other game I've ever played in my life.

40
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,439
Same thing with TF2, I've done that a ton with Team Fortress 2.

41
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,439
You play it, you think it's fun, you think it's interesting, and then yeah, I'm done playing that.

42
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,439
You wait three or four months, you come back to it, and my goodness gracious,

43
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,439
like, where was I? Where have I been all my life? This is the best thing ever.

44
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,439
I don't know why that happens, but it's something I want to talk to you guys about,

45
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,740
something I want to get your opinions on, because I do find it very, very interesting.

46
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,740
And it's interesting because why do some games do this to us, and others don't?

47
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,740
How come Tribes Ascend is that game? Why now? Why did it bring me back?

48
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,919
What turns on in our brains to make us come back and play them again?

49
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,099
Now, I'm going to bring up a franchise here that is very, very polarizing.

50
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:26,099
A lot of people don't like it, or you either love it or you hate it, and that's Call of Duty.

51
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,099
Now, I'm not going to give an opinion on it. I have a pretty neutral opinion on Call of Duty,

52
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:34,099
so I'm not going to go left or right and say, I hate it or I love it.

53
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,099
So let's just bring up the franchise in general.

54
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:42,340
So Call of Duty, like I said, whether you love it or you hate it, has this crazy addiction factor to it,

55
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,340
where even the people that don't like the game, people that have a lot of criticism for it,

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,340
people that really say it's one of the worst, you know, Modern Warfare 3 is so bad,

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,340
but they continue to play it, and they continue to enjoy themselves in this weird,

58
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,340
sort of masochistic addiction factor.

59
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,699
And I think it's because of the fast-paced arcade-style action you get in Call of Duty

60
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,699
and games like Team Fortress 2 and games like Tribes Ascend.

61
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,699
They're very fast-paced. They have a lot of stimulation in their gameplay,

62
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,699
where you kill like three or four people, you get like bang, bang, EXP, bang, bang.

63
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,699
It's very, very much an addiction.

64
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,699
And you can take this argument back to the early 80s, in the mid-80s,

65
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,699
when arcade machines were the big thing.

66
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,699
And when you had these top leaderboards, scoreboards of points,

67
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,699
something like Donkey Kong and somebody putting a quarter in

68
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:33,699
and trying to get to the top of the leaderboards, it has been like that for a long time.

69
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,699
And companies have kind of just figured out this way to make us want to put more coins in

70
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,699
because we want to get on the top of the leaderboards, and we want to get the unlockables,

71
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,699
we want to get the new skins, we want to get all of this cool stuff that the game offers us,

72
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,699
but we have to put the time and the money into doing so.

73
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,009
And to wrap up the video and bring it full circle, I want to turn it to you guys.

74
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:57,009
And ask you in the comments section below, if you want to, write out your addictions to games,

75
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,009
write out your games that you've come back to after a long time that you had a lot of fun with,

76
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,009
anything like that, because I like to keep the discussion going,

77
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,009
and I want to see what you guys have to say about this.

78
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,009
What do you think about game addiction?

79
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,009
What do you think about pulling people back into franchises?

80
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:16,009
I'd like to hear everything you guys have to say, and I will join in as well.

81
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:18,009
But that's going to wrap up the video, guys.

82
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:20,009
Thank you all so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.

83
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,009
And if you want to see more tribes gameplay,

84
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:26,009
then definitely let me know with either a comment or a like or something like that,

85
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,009
just so I can gauge if you want to see potentially more of this content.

86
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:33,009
Because I'm down for live streaming this game, I'm down for doing more videos on it,

87
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,009
I just want to gauge your guys' reaction to it.

88
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,250
So that's going to wrap up the video, thank you all so much for watching,

89
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,250
I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all soon.

90
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,250
And of course, take care everybody.
