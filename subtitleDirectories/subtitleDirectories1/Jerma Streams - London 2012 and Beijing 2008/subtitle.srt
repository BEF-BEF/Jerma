1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:16,890
Yeah, I know I said I'd be here at around noon, but I'm here now. I'm here. It's possible that Jeremy's gonna quit streaming one day.

2
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:28,460
What do you mean possible? It's absolute. You know, it's very possible that one day Jeremy's not gonna stream anymore.

3
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,219
What do you mean by- that's absolutely going to happen one day. I can't- I don't- I can't live forever.

4
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:52,450
Or possible that one day he won't stream again.

5
00:00:52,450 --> 00:01:03,469
Possible. We found all the Horcruxes. Yeah, okay. You think so.

6
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:08,469
You see, that- that- that- Voldemort, what a dummy.

7
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:15,849
Why would you make it all those fucking objects? Why would you make it stuff like that?

8
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:22,480
You- you made it the most, like, popular things, you know? Why would you do that?

9
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:34,590
No. If I had ten Horcruxes, five of them are gonna be surgically attached to my body.

10
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,019
Oh, no, one of them. Not five of them, because then if you, like, fucking shoot at it and stuff, then it's gone.

11
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:57,209
I'm sewing one of my Horcruxes into my bed. Why would you just put it in a vault? No, it's gotta be with you, around you at all times.

12
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,790
Why would you keep them on you? That defeats the purpose. No, because then you gotta come through me.

13
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,790
I want one on me. I want one to be my baseball hat.

14
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:14,060
You know what a great Horcrux would be, guys? Shit that you wouldn't even give a shit about.

15
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,930
Why wouldn't he have made one of his Horcruxes his showerhead? Who the fuck is going to do that?

16
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,169
Who would ever go into Voldemort's shower and say, this is definitely one of them? No.

17
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:41,750
The handle, the little flapper of your toilet. I'm not gonna make it some elaborate, mystical device or being, no.

18
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:56,129
It's gonna be an old book that I didn't care about reading. Or a toilet seat. Or one mug.

19
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:06,979
Anyways, hi. What was the joke? Oh yeah, people are just kinda coming in and just catching it halfway.

20
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,979
Just go watch the beginning of the stream. It's only been like three minutes, so you can catch up.

21
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:21,030
What if it accidentally gets destroyed?

22
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:35,300
Um, I don't think I'm gonna be taking a shower and cast the Iviticus spell into the wall near the showerhead.

23
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:44,870
Magical spells would be banned in my bathroom. It just wouldn't be allowed.

24
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,870
Like, now fuck that. You wouldn't be allowed to cast spells in my house.

25
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,870
You know how people have the rule of take your shoes off before you enter the house?

26
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,419
Put your wand of no spells in this house. None.

27
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,419
We're gonna do the Olympics today. 2012 London Olympics.

28
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:09,240
Not Mario and Sonic at the London Olympic Games. No, we're just doing...

29
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,240
This apparently is the one that has the most of games to play.

30
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,379
I think it has 35 events.

31
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:26,720
I also have the Beijing one. 2008. For some reason. I don't know why. I own it.

32
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:36,040
It was not that expensive. Don't worry. This sucks. Just go play God Hand.

33
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,339
I mean, that's an option if I don't like it. I don't think that's gonna be possible, though.

34
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:48,029
I saw a little bit of the preview of what this... I'm gonna try to get gold medals. Silver medals, at least.

35
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:57,899
You ready? I am. Here it is.

36
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:04,759
I've had to hear this in my ears since the stream started, by the way.

37
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,129
Six straight, seven straight minutes. This doesn't change.

38
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:18,399
All right. Olympic Games. Take on the world at the London 2012 Olympic Games.

39
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:30,430
This is almost ten years ago, yes. I'm gonna... I'm doing it. I'm gonna try to win as many as I can.

40
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,740
How do streamers even read chat? We have s... s... We don't. We don't.

41
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,740
We don't. We just pick out one thing that somebody said every ten minutes.

42
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,319
And hope that it's fucking relevant to the conversation.

43
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,319
I'm just kidding. Face Camo Riot. See? No, I can read that one.

44
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:56,860
Select how challenging the CPU will be. Well, we can't even do hard, so don't even tell me to select it. I can't do it.

45
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:07,220
Play tw... Well, hold on. Play 12 events. Play 20 events.

46
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,300
Is this like Mario Party? Am I only selecting just the amount of turns we're gonna have?

47
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,660
How funny would that be if this just opened up on a game board with the dice and shit?

48
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,899
What? No no no no no no no no no! Don't... Oh, a six.

49
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,870
That'd actually be awesome. I kind of wish it was like that.

50
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:35,930
That was kind of funny I guess. I was... that was just what it sounds like when you play Mario Party with the dice.

51
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,930
Like, that's just... I mean that was a fact. Not a joke.

52
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,930
All right. Who am I playing as?

53
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,279
Okay, we have

54
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,189
Australia

55
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,709
Hmm. I have to be the United States right like I'm from the United States. Is this locked?

56
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:54,300
What?

57
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:07,949
Why is the United States locked? What's no, it's definitely not locked. Oh shit. Okay. I am

58
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,949
American

59
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,149
Somebody made this joke, but I'm gonna make it too. I

60
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,790
Had a plan to make this as well. I hope it's like an hour and 40 minute long cut

61
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,829
Splendid glowing like a beacon here in London's East End

62
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,949
So many nations represented here already to compete alright, so do I have to be part of the opening ceremony

63

Somebody tell George not to spin the camera so much. I'm gonna fucking puke mate. You're going too fast

64
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,079

No, I'm gonna do a bunch of events. I want to be part of all the events at least as many as I can

76
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:40,029

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,859
Songs songs playing over the other song. There are three songs

158
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,660
I

159
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Don't know how to do this

160
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,539
The eight go through to the final all right, mr

161
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,559
Dan yeah the first of the four of the eight goes for the final by the way

162
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,980
This is the first time that mr. Dan has ever stepped foot on track and field the first time he's ever done a long jump

163
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,490
Welcome to the Olympics mate. Don't slow

164
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:35,049
Press X to begin running

165
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:40,549
Tap X to fill the bar fill the bar above the white line without overflowing it

166
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,200
That that's me touching it once

167
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,309
Speed lock what the fuck

168
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:55,670
Lick of L as the athlete approaches the white line

169
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:06,089
Get one practice run

170
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:10,210
I'm ready

171
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,210
All right, mr. Dan, let's go

172
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:26,180
Team USA for the next round. Well, this is his first attempt ever. Okay speed has been locked in

173
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:37,549
Well, he looked distracted on his approach towards the board

174
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,819
Looks like he snapped his ankle. He really twisted his ankle

175
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:57,869
That's embarrassing that's in front of 200 million people or

176
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:05,410
I could probably beat that right now. Yeah, I could probably do that right now

177
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,950
By a huge amount by the way, not a little

178
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,759
Alright, come on redemption. Mr. Dan

179
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:33,460
Groove it. I could in the second round. That was super fast. Alright, here we go. I mean too low

180
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,559
Sensitive I think it is I'm trying not to do it so hard

181
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:52,819
That was five point four. That was okay. Well, this is a bit of a shock team USA are in last place

182
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,299
Come on, I think it's pressure sensitive

183
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:15,710
Smooth athletes on the runway. I got no idea. Okay, so hold on. That was pretty good. Let's step over the line

184
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,910
What?

185
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,890
Here's the scoreboard and it shows team USA in eighth place

186
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,220
God damn it. All right

187
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,779
That was good

188
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:49,019
What's that one right on the line? You better not disqualify. Yeah, you're gonna disqualify that bullshit

189
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,180
What

190
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:59,319
Here's the scoreboard. We're gonna adjust that dude's glasses. Okay, that was right on the line. I got disqualified

191
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:05,069
The world records eight. I still don't understand

192
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:12,029
So, okay. I'm good. I'm I pressed it one one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven two one two three four two

193
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,589
Fire one two. It's two. It's hard. Okay, here we go

194
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:27,170
That better not be a foul that was before the to say it's a foul

195
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,400
How many times do I have to do this?

196
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,859
I'm just embarrassing myself

197
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,799
chance saloon sixth and final attempt

198
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:43,789
That was so bad. I just hard

199
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,880
Well, that's awful a new personal best is not even as good as

200
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,440
Like a 15 year old in high school to the middle to the end all wrong

201
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:10,539
Eighth place well totally frustrated and ejected and quite rightly so

202
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,099
That wasn't the best performance

203
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,190
8.1

204
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:22,210
Well, this is a massive shock one of the favorites has gone out team usa miss out on qualification

205
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,869
That was qualification. All right, I got men's 200. Are you kidding me? I'm gonna fucking destroy this

206
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,440
Sorry, mr. Dan

207
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:42,779
Comes to redemption. Yeah

208
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:47,180
Because this one absolutely is going to be tap x as fast as you can and i'm going to destroy all those

209
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,650
This is a terrific venue

210
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,119
From some recycled and okay, what's the shove button materials? This really is a green stadium

211
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,079
Of the new millennium. Oh i'm looking for the r ready to go on the first step

212
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,680
Of their olympic dream. I was looking for who us. Okay, there's bilping dan

213
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,180
tutorial

214
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:20,960
Press x to launch

215
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,839
Tap repeatedly to fill the bar fill the bar above the white line without overflowing the speed

216
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:41,410
It's actually very hard to keep it here. I'll tell you

217
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,210
I see running like that

218
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,450
lunge

219
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,210
Okay, keep bar in the green. It's so hard to do that. You have no idea

220
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,650
It's so pressure sensitive and so fucked up

221
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,009
All right, let's do it. I'm ready

222
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:06,109
Pop four doping dan get in there

223
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,650
When do I go just comes down to perform?

224
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:21,440
Hold on

225
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,079
Come on drugs you motherfuckers

226
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,400
You'll never beat me. I'm gonna catch up to this little brick

227
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,599
Second place third place

228
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:05,589
When it came down to the finish on the line good strength to go through the tape another good performance

229
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:08,470
Oh

230
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:38,720
Okay, this is it this is the real one this is for the olympic gold medal

231
00:31:49,670 --> 00:32:02,470
I gotta get a gold with doping dan. Come on. He's psyched up for this. Here we go

232
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,599
Okay, i'm ready. I'll be ready

233
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,079
Certainly middle of the pack in terms of best times this year

234
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,640
However, there's no doubting the ability deep inside that body. The question mark though has been over the desire

235
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:24,390
Has to work harder at this stage 50 meters gone and already in stride

236
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,710
Well, this race really starting to take shape as they approach halfway

237
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,589
Leading the way it's island

238
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,119
Into what's the line here?

239
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,890
That's the gold medal

240
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:53,269
I want to see that. I want to see that

241
00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:03,200
See how small that bar got at the very end. That's the gold medal. That's one

242
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:10,920
Don't worry. I'll get a shitload more

243
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:20,519
Wait, do I have a medal ceremony?

244
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,519
Is this a league game? No, so smooth from start to finish

245
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,039
Straight into the stride and then once in rhythm

246
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,799
What a performance amazing

247
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,839
I think I lost final check on the standings. Then what's an event? This has been

248
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,299
Confirmed now a gold medal for the usa. Holy shit 21.71

249
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
21.72

250
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:07,410
Zero point one. This is the moment where finally the athlete is crowned the new

251
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,730
Olympic champion

252
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:18,610
Emotions running high no doubt as they step onto the podium. I did it big smiles as the chris's one for the national anthem

253
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,309
There'll be tears flowing

254
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:30,690
Wait, that's not that's not the whole thing

255
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,570
condensed national

256
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,969
Take a commercial break

257
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:48,159
These are memories that will live long for these oh say can you see a medal from an olympic games

258
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,239

259
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,360
What so we'll be back let's have a look I actually forgot the national anthem had to stop I had to just get out of that

260
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,679
Well, that's it from the olympic stadium for now from seth bennett. We'll see you next time

261
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,889
I had to get out

262
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,889
All right. I got a gold medal. Yeah

263
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:14,179
You've had a mr. Dan couldn't jump

264
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,030
I got a retry token. Well, you get currency if you do well

265
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:33,090
I got three medal points. Ooh. All right day one

266
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,869
Campaign summary either results in the events

267
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,659
But did not qualify. Okay

268
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
Medal tally, let's take a look

269
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:49,730
United states one gold medal

270
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,130
Poland's right underneath

271
00:35:52,130 --> 00:36:01,030
Important link is it find out? Yeah, that's pretty important

272
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,400
That mouth

273
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:17,409
Why does it have such a scary mouth?

274
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:33,510
Okay, we got women's archery under breaststroke trampoline

275
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,079
Rapid fire pistol. Oh, how many can I do too? That's it

276
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,699
I need to do all right. I want to I want to rapid fire pistol

277
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,650
And then I want to archery too, though

278
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:52,769
Trampoline I wish you could do more than two

279
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:57,960
Okay, men's trampoline. Here we go

280
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Rampel how do you do?

281
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,480
What are you doing a trampoline lips and shit?

282
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:21,989
All right, let's do some backflip. This is me. This is me. I gotta do well these athletes equally matched

283
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,920
All right, select the routine

284
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,869
Select the tutorial routine and proceed to the next phase when selecting routine look at the difficulty and tariff before making a decision

285
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,949
What's the meaning tariff?

286
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,110
Pay taxes on my routine

287
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,519
The athlete will automatically build momentum. The routine moves are shown in the upper left area of the screen

288
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,920
Okay

289
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,000
So it's like circle

290
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,199
Square

291
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,679
press circle to start a tucked somersault

292
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,480
Press square to perform a pike shape at the start of the second somersault

293
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,599
New button prompts appear when you must perform each element

294
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,639
First down as the somersault completes to exit

295
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:15,380
You only have 70 seconds to complete all eight skills any missed skills will award zero difficulty points and occur a heavy execution penalty

296
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:17,699
And try to time your inputs

297
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,349
Okay, here we go

298
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:25,829
I'm gonna do like fucking five backflips

299
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,760
Do people like shut up in the stands like golf you would need that right they do right in 2000 in sydney

300
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,360
Trampolining is now very much part of the fixtures and fittings

301
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,760
Three times men have competed in this event and there's been three different winners

302
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,130
beginner

303
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,929
Oh, but what are they no room for error?

304
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:58,769
They only get one chance in this event so selection of the routine is germa germa germa. What what?

305
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,719
expert two no

306
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:11,840
Well, they only get one chance on the trampoline and they've gone for a big routine now

307
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,239
This will be their chance to shine

308
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:36,420
Fencing up and down just not good enough. It's the tricks that'll get in the points

309
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:41,860
I'm doing them. How do I do other skills? I know one move. How do I do other moves?

310
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:47,719
Just jumping up and down isn't going to score him any points here. Oh shit. There it is really executes that beautifully

311
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,400
Oh fantastic

312
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:59,010
And he really needs to get the tricks in now great work with the routine there shit

313
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,280
That was a triple. I just did a triple skill level out there ideally

314
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,880
He needs to finish that routine on his feet not his front

315
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,559
Come on. We really need to see the routine now. Come on

316
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,050
Oh showing great technique there

317
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:25,409
He's not gonna get far in this competition. Just jumping up and down i'm doing it

318
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:39,510
I'm gonna recap on that one now. Here's the replay

319
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:47,010
Oh, that was sick. These are incredible moves. Oh

320
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,119
Oh, I can't I get it. I was doing the same move over and over again

321
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:32,019
Finally there's the other move it's that same spin. Okay. All right. All right what I get six

322
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,579
Intrigued to know what the judges think

323
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:44,079
Oh showing frustration more than anything. They know that performance just wasn't up to scratch today

324
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:51,190
Well, that's all the action we have for you now from this event time now to hand back over to Seth bennett

325
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,250
That's your commentator alison kerbishly

326
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:08,070
I looked over the chat somebody just said fucking loser. How does this work?

327
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:13,800
To the world artillery barracks here in the artillery barracks

328
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,039
This should be a great venue for the shooting events. I feel like throw grenades

329
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,360
rapid fire pistol

330
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:28,869
Until 1984 men and women regularly competed against one another in the shooting event

331
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,900
What is this?

332
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:41,679
Is that that is a grenade i'm holding a grenade. What's a grenade in my hand? Oh, no, it's not. Oh, dear

333
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,940
R2 r2 to shoot

334
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,119
Kind of good

335
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,920
Time limit per round reduces across the event the final two rounds last for only four seconds

336
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,219
For the best results aim the pistol in one continuous motion to shoot all the targets as quickly as possible

337
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:23,000
To say these athletes can afford to make a mistake today any slip ups and then they won't I came right from the trampoline

338
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:27,750
Okay, here we go. You gotta be quick

339
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,840
Can I just shoot the same target in five different places eight seconds to hit five targets

340
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
We go three two one

341
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:51,599
Oh, I got it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. We got I got six out of there. I got a six. It's okay

342
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,880
Always good to get on the leaderboard in the first round

343
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:58,869
Round two

344
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:06,630
Let's get I only have four seconds to do this at the end. Okay six seconds

345
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:27,750
The results on the scoreboard aren't good

346
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:30,389
And some way behind the leaders

347
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:34,519
It's nerve-racking, okay

348
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,690
I'll get it this time

349
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,409
Thanks up round three. Let's go six seconds

350
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,940
Okay

351
00:44:51,940 --> 00:45:00,320
All right, I brought it back

352
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,679
Let's go i'll pull this back

353
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,710
Okay, do I have a red dot four seconds

354
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,550
Oh

355
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:29,269
That's hard as hell

356
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:32,789
I gotta get into fourth place fourth place is placing right place

357
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,679
No, wait, this isn't mario kart. It's not like bronze two

358
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:40,369
I need to get third

359
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:48,019
Number five this gets really tough as the scoring rings tighten

360
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:53,619
shit

361
00:45:53,619 --> 00:46:06,280
That's it. I gotta pull the other four. All right, let's go team usa in one more round. I gotta nail this one

362
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:20,309
Number six then final round to make this one count

363
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:28,630
The fuck out of here. I'll take second place right now. Let's pull it back up through a silver medal

364
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,199
fourth place

365
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,559
At least i'm mario kart placed

366
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,639
I'm using a retry token

367
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:17,199
Wait that was wait that wasn't wait what hold on a second that was wait, hold on

368
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,960
That was just for the qualifying that was not for the medal

369
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,340
I just retried a qualifier with a retry token

370
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:36,849
Oh, well, he looked so upset. Did you see him? He was holding his head. He's like i lost I didn't know

371
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:39,329
You'd be qualified what?

372
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,969
If you qualified you'd be happy. Why would he be so upset on the screen? It's all right. It gives me practice

373
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,420
Six seconds to hit five targets

374
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:11,590
Pressures on i'm gonna take the second place to qualifying four seconds then to hit the five targets. This is a good practice

375
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:19,360
Yeah, i'm gonna nail it now. I've got the rhythm

376
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:27,429
Second place

377
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:38,710
Here's round five then five targets four seconds to hit them. I'll take first place at the real actual medal event

378
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:45,650
Team usa so far and the scoreboard confirms it there in first place

379
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:52,289
Here we go round six then the final round has to shoot well here and he did

380
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:57,730
First place then now he's happy. I needed to be happy

381
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:07,969
To produce your best at the olympic games is all anyone why do they need a replay for this?

382
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,679
Well, let's take a check on the final standings in the top three. All right

383
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,889
In this one men's 20, it's rapid fire pistol. This is the one that counts I have one

384
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:31,559
return token

385
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,900
All right, come on me go i gotta be clean

386
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,300
Round one, let's do it. Eight seconds to hit the five targets

387
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:50,179
plenty of time

388
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,599
All right, it's okay. All right. That's all right. That's the second

389
00:49:55,239 --> 00:50:01,090
It's really tight at the top of that scoreboard at the end of that round

390
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:06,769
And with this show just how good competition this is at this stage first shot was fucked up. Yeah it was

391
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:10,820
Here we go round two then two seconds off the clock

392
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:13,380
Same number of targets

393
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:21,190
That's all right. That's good. Good. Keep it locked in first place

394
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:37,039
94 94 tied what happens if it is tight round three

395
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:46,079
Here we go

396
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,360
Oh, there was like a loud sound outside. It didn't fuck me up

397
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:54,789
First place

398
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,769
All right, I can lose it really quickly here don't get overconfident

399
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:11,199
This is the four seconds

400
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:23,559
What happened why did it fire twice oh my fucking god, why did it go pop pop

401
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,880
Decent performance the pressure sensitive bullshit of the biggie

402
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:36,130
Needs to remain accurate here. Come the fuck on

403
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,239
You gotta be kidding me, dude. Are you serious?

404
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,760
I don't think I can even do that double tap again if I wanted to

405
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,639
On the sixth round five targets four seconds can't make a mistake here in the final round

406
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,900
I'm thinking if somebody did that they missed twice and they went like oh my god

407
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,400
What happened did I win here's the replay of that I got a bronze medal

408
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:24,119
And can you take gold in this event a real performance from this athlete?

409
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:29,730
Plenty of smiles in the hungarian campus this athlete takes home a silver medal

410
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:46,019
This is a proud moment for this athlete retry. No, I can't I need to save it. Have fun with your bronze medal

411
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:51,079
A bronze is fine

412
00:52:51,079 --> 00:53:02,150
No, i'm not gonna retry it

413
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:14,659
Traditionally at the olympic games it runs one gold another fantastic achievement

414
00:53:25,699 --> 00:53:27,699
Why is it so sad to look at that screen?

415
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:36,019
Okay, I want to do the archery. I'm gonna do archery. What's

416
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:39,119
K-ring

417
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,420
Oh, this is discus throw. I'm gonna do k-ring. I don't know what that means

418
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:52,769
I'm gonna do it

419
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:55,090
Wait, do we is this gonna we get gold medal glenn here?

420
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,159
Okay, here we go. This is

421
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,329
archery

422
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:15,360
Come on glenn where's the bow?

423
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:24,530
The boy this is gonna run around like stab stuff. It was so important in the 14th century. It was compulsory. Oh, okay

424
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:26,789
hold

425
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:32,099
Hard to draw the bow

426
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:35,940
Use l to aim release r quickly to fire the arrow

427
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,050
All right

428
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,860
Flight's affected by the wind be sure to compensate for wind strength

429
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,579
Is drop?

430
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:50,400
Okay, 20 seconds before the shots forward you got it

431
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
All right, come on christin reed

432
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:08,469
Kristen reed's going for the gold number one two megabits per second up to the top left

433
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,099
That's not a bullseye

434
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,840
Two miles per hour that way that's

435
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,280
It doesn't think two miles per hour was gonna be that big of a deal

436
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:59,920
That's a qualify that's pretty sick let's have a look at the leaderboard then yeah that I did great after the first end

437
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,119
meters per second

438
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,119
So that's actually like six

439
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,500
Seven miles per hour

440
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,139
Why are we doing um dumb dumb from the united states boy?

441
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:15,780
Why come they don't do how come they don't convert every single thing for the one country on earth?

442
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,940
That doesn't care to do the metric system. Why couldn't do why don't you do that for me?

443
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:30,079
I expect you to do everything twice. So I understand it. This is it

444
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:38,320
This is heavy wind up. Thank you

445
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:55,460
Thank you

446
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,030
This is actually fun

447
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,550
I like this

448
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:16,179
There's a flat earth competition at the olympics. I don't know what that means. Let's have a look at the scoreboard

449
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:19,059
Is that like just bring a bunch of beer and yell at each other?

450
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:22,179
And they've done an argue about it. What do you what do you do? I don't know what that means

451
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,619
This certainly isn't theirs to be taking for granted at this stage

452
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:34,949
What do you have a competition?

453
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:40,630
Uh, I think I think you're looking for debate and the competitors will shoot towards the magnificent media center

454
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,670
You compare the planets to see what one is the flattest

455
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,679
This is arrow number two for this athlete I need a bullseye right here. You gotta do it quick

456
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:07,110
Almost hit the other one

457
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,559
That's a qualification right there

458
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,039
Yeah, if I just play like that i'll be fine

459
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:30,150
This is the final end let's try to hit the other target

460
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:39,539
This is the final end only two hours to go. I mean two hours to go

461
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:51,989
It seems like a long time

462
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:54,650
Damn, I can't get in that middle. It's magnetized

463
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:59,719
two arrows, oh

464
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:09,030
two hours

465
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:11,030
I thought I thought he said hours

466
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:19,619
All right, here comes. Okay, quality finally. Will this be can I finally qualify for two events?

467
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:31,969
Men's hiring finish cycling. Oh boy, this is gonna be interesting

468
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:43,429
This has been described as a

469
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:46,150
Is doug dopamine here? What his name is?

470
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:53,960
And dope six of the world's best trying to make it through to this olympic final. There's what is the name dope?

471
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:01,559
Doping doping. Yeah hasn't been a good event for team usa never once finishing on the podium in the three occasions. How does this work?

472
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,699
Oh, I can't go that way

473
01:00:08,699 --> 01:00:10,480
repeatedly tap

474
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,480
Oh, yeah, you're gonna see

475
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,090
Hold down x to cruise

476
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:24,039
Oh, I see you use the stamina push

477
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,679
And hold to move

478
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:36,559
How many people are on the track when we do this?

479
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:51,219
Okay, I know how to steer

480
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:59,300
Sprinting uses stamina cruising regain stamina slipstream behind opponents to quickly regain stamina. All right

481
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:19,119
Am I all the way at the end just like bullying everybody

482
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:34,980
You ain't fucking passing me

483
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,940
This is what it sucks. That's why it sucks to be cold versus koopa

484
01:01:48,119 --> 01:02:01,079
You ain't getting by me. You're getting by me. Good luck. I thought it was putting his hand throw punch

485
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:09,170
Performance is no denying that as we take another look at the isn't what i'm doing illegal

486
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:13,159
You can't do that

487
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:26,360
Let's take a check on the official results then following that race like I can get this

488
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
All right. This is this is where it counts

489
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,199
It's called blocking. It's illegal

490
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,900
Can I get two goals back to back?

491
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:43,699
They don't care

492
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,250
All right christen, let's go

493
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,730
I'm ready

494
01:02:51,329 --> 01:03:06,039
Wait, what I can pump the crowd up. All right now I can't just whip it

495
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:23,809
Having seen the first arrow what adjustments will this athlete make here we go. All right

496
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:28,769
Good shot required to finish end one on the high

497
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,369
That's not wait. That's the exact same spot

498
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,440
That was the same arrow

499
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:47,400
It replaced the other one. Holy shit

500
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:52,440
Expected the united states make a strong start to this. Okay, I gotta be better

501
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,400
25 26. I gotta get that gold medal

502
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:01,219
I'm gonna pump the crowd up again. How do I do that square?

503
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,380
Still on a breathless day at lords

504
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:11,079
There it is

505
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:35,000
No wind

506
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Yep

507
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:48,869
Hold back the points from the seven not bad. Let's see if we're good first place

508
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:54,789
Two more chances I can overtake it. I know I can

509
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:11,860
That's a ten that cream that top number

510
01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:21,860
Oh, yeah

511
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:31,969
Let's get 30. I'll fall into first place. I'll get that gold medal. I can smell it. Oh, that's all right

512
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,969
More to the total for that

513
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:45,969
29 it's good. That's a good score

514
01:05:49,570 --> 01:06:02,739
Three points ahead on the scoreboard do it again every wind here

515
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,369
That could have been that wind changed on me right when I was about to let go did you see that

516
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,369
Oh

517
01:06:24,369 --> 01:06:36,639
It was seven did it change to seven? Oh man. That was a huge amount of fucking wind

518
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:46,070
Britain's gonna fuck it up

519
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:50,949
No, they're gonna have just as much trouble. I'm gonna be in first place still where we go first place. I told you gold medal

520
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:55,190
Those double tens back to back last round really saved it

521
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,630
Told you close

522
01:07:04,369 --> 01:07:06,369
Close

523
01:07:13,889 --> 01:07:19,010
Here we go here comes

524
01:07:20,849 --> 01:07:23,429
Nice work kristen second gold medal

525
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,639
And

526
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,199
I completely forgot about the happy birthday shit

527
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,510
from the green screen day

528
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:35,699
Can you get a minus two permanently?

529
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,050
No

530
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:44,369
That's not you can't do that. It's the final of the men's care. All right. Remember the tactic here is fully

531
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:50,039
The goal here is

532
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:56,600
Square in the circle peg hole thing just get it in there futuristic approach to this like a baby toy

533
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:02,199
Specifically designed get the square just it's not supposed to fit but you're gonna get the square into the circle

534
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:07,409
It's in the shape of their lives and there's no reason why they can't go

535
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:16,840
To win a medal here

536
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:52,689
Am I getting booed just don't let him go by you wait, why is he taller? Why is he flying?

537
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,210
Do you see he's flying?

538
01:09:54,210 --> 01:10:06,260
Did you see that? He like grew two times in size and was floating

539
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:13,800
It's another gold medal

540
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:29,729
Plenty of heart plenty of energy plenty of passion and most of all plenty of power. He almost came inside world

541
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:35,189
There we go, here it comes

542
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:40,609
Well, this is the moment where we can enjoy success and certainly they'll be doing that on the podium

543
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,329
Time for the national anthems to celebrate

544
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:50,710
Let's take a quick check on the overall medal tally three golds one bronze

545
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:57,729
That concludes things for the day no more events remaining in this session so from seth bennett and all the team

546
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:01,970
Will bid you a fond farewell skip skip skip you skipped

547
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,779
No, that's just

548
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:07,859
That's abbreviated

549
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:13,220
They look they abbreviated it already. So i'm just like I didn't I pressed x. I didn't know I was gonna skip it completely

550
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:19,109
I unlocked spain's outfit

551
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:28,819
cool, I guess

552
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,720
All right, what's next two events

553
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,180
Press stroke disc throw and weightlifting. Yeah

554
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:44,369
We need to do disc throw

555
01:11:44,449 --> 01:11:53,039
Is there wrestling? I don't know. There's a lot

556
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:58,319
there is

557
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:02,119
45 different events and I think some of those are

558
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:07,560
25 meter 50 meter 100 meter, right? It's supposed to be 40 events

559
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:13,399
This throw i'm ready

560
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:18,920
Put it in 3d is one of the oldest events to feature in the olympic games. How does this work?

561
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,640
Push and hold r don't release the stick

562
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:28,710
When the ring appears push and hold r this way don't release r until all three

563
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:35,970
what

564
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:40,130
When the ring appears push don't really what the fuck are you trying to get me to do?

565
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,680
Okay, let's try that again

566
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,119
push this way

567
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,369
Okay, when the ring appears push the other way

568
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:55,350
Don't release it now. Okay, push this way

569
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,340
push this way

570
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:03,569
Push that way again push when the ring appears release r

571
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,449
Best throw flick when the yellow line is in the middle of the blue zone

572
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:26,470
Okay

573
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:34,630
Here we go certainly put the pressure on with germany lithuania and estonia all taking medals

574
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:39,250
That's all right. That's pretty good power and then

575
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:51,640
So it's a foul but here's the scoreboard and that tells its own story

576
01:13:56,069 --> 01:13:58,069
This is qualifying i'll get it

577
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:03,359
round two

578
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:05,359
power lock flick it

579
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:18,449
I'm not gonna qualify i'm not gonna qualify

580
01:14:28,819 --> 01:14:34,760
It's good

581
01:14:40,869 --> 01:14:43,029
I have to really clean this up right now

582
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:45,109
Eighth place

583
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:53,890
I'm gonna do a high angle

584
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,890
That's what we call it's going out of the stadium

585
01:14:56,529 --> 01:14:59,170
I just broke a record

586
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:05,319
That'll bring me back to like fourth place

587
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,880
That put me in first place

588
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:17,699
That apparently was so good that I went from eighth to first

589
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,300
I can't laugh

590
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:25,619
Don't laugh

591
01:15:38,369 --> 01:15:40,369
All right, I qualify I qualify

592
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:48,000
The u.s.a

593
01:15:48,000 --> 01:16:03,560
Power new

594
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:07,399
When I broke the olympic record in the qualifying round

595
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:17,000
Why can't I do that during the actual competition? Does it?

596
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,789
Shit

597
01:16:34,789 --> 01:16:37,409
Hey, but I gotta make it count

598
01:16:37,409 --> 01:16:39,409
You can hit 500 home runs

599
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:43,649
In the exhibition games, but in the playoffs if you go 0 for 10

600
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,689
That's what people remember

601
01:16:52,520 --> 01:17:03,039
It's true. All right, here comes weightlifting

602
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,020
Over 155 kilograms

603
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:20,710
Here we go original one and two handlers at the first two olympic games

604
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,770
How does weightlifting work

605
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:31,090
Tap x you must build power above the indicator

606
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:37,409
Pull l and r down simultaneously

607
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:41,489
Push l and r up simultaneously not pushing straight loses power

608
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:48,050
All right

609
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:51,489
Tap x until the judges turn wild turn white what?

610
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:58,149
Oh the light, right?

611
01:17:58,149 --> 01:18:09,649
Okay, you can only attempt three lifts. So make each one count

612
01:18:10,289 --> 01:18:13,750
Try to lift as straight as possible for maximum power

613
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:17,189
The athlete will start to tremble when he's about to drop the bar

614
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:21,220
Okay, let's do it

615
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:30,100
Competing in qualifying in the weightlifting. It's the first round and this athlete has to choose what weight they want to come in on

616
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,109
Rack the whole thing

617
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:36,229
If he doesn't get this right, he'll be very disappointed

618
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:46,229
Couldn't get them to budge what strange effort that I was tapping x

619
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:58,680
What happened? You're gonna get a good idea as to exactly how this lifter feels tap x right successful with the first attempt

620
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,520
But will he throw more weight on the bar for round two?

621
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:09,250
What well doesn't manage to lift anything here do I have a timer of like two seconds

622
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:17,430
I want to lower the weight down

623
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:21,079
I don't okay. I'm trying to adjust the weight. It won't let me

624
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:30,710
Well, this is the final attempt for this athlete

625
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:35,840
Obviously the nerves are at an absolute premium here

626
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:43,029
Well, you can see the athlete very frustrated with that. You make it all the way to the olympics

627
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:48,529
And you say hey put put on like 500 pounds dude

628
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:52,529
Take it off an inch off the ground

629
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:56,130
Holy shit, that's so embarrassing. I want to should I redo it?

630
01:19:57,989 --> 01:19:59,989
I couldn't even take any off

631
01:20:04,689 --> 01:20:07,010
Retry token. No, no, no

632
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:10,500
It's all right. I got the disc throw

633
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:13,159
I was just tapping x why couldn't I

634
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,840
I wasn't doing anything else

635
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,560
It was like tap x to you till you get to the power and then you press down with both and up with both

636
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,560
I didn't get a chance to press down

637
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,609
Welcome to this beautiful

638
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:37,010
All right, here comes the guy with the world records what a value this is are you ready for this world record

639
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:40,199
Pump them up

640
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:50,560
The athlete will spin around as fast as possible before releasing the discus all two kilograms of it

641
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:56,399
Get that out of here. That's a perfect throw

642
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:04,359
Full power. I just broke I broke the world. That's a world record. I went I don't have to do anything else game over

643
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:14,630
Can I just leave

644
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:15,189
Can they okay?

645
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:18,229
Can we just stop the event just give me the gold medal I could watch the rest of the event

646
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:40,470
All right. Now I have to beat the world record that I just made nerves should be gone by now. This guy's a fucking maniac

647
01:21:42,449 --> 01:21:44,050
Oh damn it

648
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:46,050
That world record

649
01:21:54,069 --> 01:21:57,909
Nobody can do anything to catch this athlete now, I need 75

650
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:04,279
Can you imagine being in the olympics?

651
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,720
You train for 10 years to get here and the first guy that gets up for the first heat

652
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,520
Breaks the world record

653
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:24,489
You want to talk about just completely demoralizing?

654
01:22:38,899 --> 01:22:40,899
I don't think i'll ever get past 70 for six

655
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:53,680
Justice is back full power break the record

656
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,720
oops

657
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,720
Sorry, it's still in play

658
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,720
Doesn't matter

659
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,920
I just i'm not gonna be able to do it. I'm just throwing it into the ground

660
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:32,369
Should I bm this is round number five then i'm trying to let it go. I'm just trying to drop it

661
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,600
All right, i'm going for it again

662
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,640
They're in first place

663
01:23:52,960 --> 01:24:00,359
Y'all fuck off. Whatever. I got the record who cares

664
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:24,210
We just did olympic records

665
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:28,130
Let's have a look at the replay he's not even human

666
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:32,210
The approach really the release point great

667
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:38,819
And it just came down to the distance fantastic. Holy shit. That cameraman really is messing up

668
01:24:39,939 --> 01:24:44,920
Like I took pictures two or three seconds after it landed. It's horrible

669
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:57,029
That's like two or three thousand milliseconds lag

670
01:25:03,539 --> 01:25:05,539
Training

671
01:25:20,529 --> 01:25:27,090
Next song celebrations will begin. Um, well, that's the end of the day plays if you win plenty more action to come

672
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,489
Okay, we got four gold medals

673
01:25:30,289 --> 01:25:35,670
I want to take a look at the standard metal tally. Let's see

674
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:39,010
Oh, i'm just i'm killing

675
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:42,289
four

676
01:25:42,289 --> 01:25:50,420
four golds

677
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,760
Javelin throw you got it. Absolutely

678
01:25:56,989 --> 01:25:58,989
freestyle of swimming

679
01:26:00,609 --> 01:26:03,430
kayaking

680
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,310
Okay

681
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:06,550
kayaking iking and javelin throw

682
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:11,880
Wait, do we get to use?

683
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,880
uh the record holder

684
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,689
I feel like if he if he could throw a disc that will

685
01:26:17,409 --> 01:26:20,739
Just give him a javelin teach him that too

686
01:26:25,109 --> 01:26:29,670
Yeah, any object that you just have to throw hard. It's really fun. Just teach him everything

687
01:26:30,229 --> 01:26:36,239
Olympic games always has a strong dan. Okay

688
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:40,449
Oh boy

689
01:26:40,449 --> 01:26:42,210
Have to begin running

690
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:47,729
Have to fill the bar

691
01:26:47,729 --> 01:26:48,770
pull

692
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,000
push

693
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,239
The perfect angle is 35 degrees

694
01:26:58,369 --> 01:27:00,930
Okay, I didn't have very much time to process that. Okay

695
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:08,199
Don't get that much time to do this

696
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:26,260
Starts the run now. What where's the foul line? What because I stepped over it after throwing this one

697
01:27:26,899 --> 01:27:36,579
There's no point measuring it that throw won't because it's a foul if he goes in round number two

698
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:46,739
Get out of here. Come on

699
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:53,029
68 confirmation on the standings. I want to beat another world record

700
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:57,189
I can never reach that high again and it sucks. I want to do it

701
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:12,439
Beat the olympic record. Oh just personal best

702
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:26,560
Should be no nerves now in round number four

703
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,340
I fucked it up

704
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,340
Sorry, I'm still on the first place

705
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:51,800
Here we go again then in round five of the javelin I get it. All right, it's gonna get more speed

706
01:28:59,109 --> 01:28:59,750
Okay

707
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:05,109
If you had to stand out there and just stand with your arms to your sides and stand straight up and not move at all

708
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:09,640
And this dude got three attempts to throw the javelin at you

709
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:14,020
Would you do that for a hundred grand?

710
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:20,960
Do you think he would be that accurate to get you? I don't know. I feel like it'd be hard to be that accurate

711
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:37,859
It's a lot of money. Yeah, yeah, because yo you have to stand still. Yeah

712
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:45,859
And there's there's like an operation style device that's on your body that if you move it goes

713
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:53,670
And then just did the 100 grand is removed disqualified. So we're gonna come down to this the delivery

714
01:29:58,279 --> 01:30:14,720
36 degrees

715
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:21,670
Washed up don't throw so early. It's freaking me out because I stepped over the line once good technique

716
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:25,090
absolutely rock solid technique

717
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:30,079
I just gotta get one or two good ones. That'll be good

718
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,359
All right, here comes kayaking this one's gonna be interesting

719
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:45,100
If he gets too close, i'll just move. Yeah, you can just be like, all right, whatever i'm gonna take

720
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:56,670
This looks pretty cool

721
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:03,600
Wait, did more than one person do this event at the same time?

722
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,310
Isn't that kind of dangerous? Why is this like a mario kart level?

723
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,579
Is it like this?

724
01:31:12,579 --> 01:31:20,670
Until the final big drop big man. Let's have a look at everybody. I didn't even do the tutorial. Oh, yeah, I did

725
01:31:21,149 --> 01:31:23,710
Okay l is used to propel and turn

726
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:28,050
hold while turning

727
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:30,350
Hold x and boost forward

728
01:31:30,909 --> 01:31:35,979
Paddle downstream through the green and white holes to successfully complete

729
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:46,859
Hold well to paddle past the red and white holes uptrend gates must be completed while moving back to the course

730
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,460
Hold r2 to plant the paddle

731
01:31:51,699 --> 01:31:53,220
quickly turn

732
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:57,579
Right towards the gate

733
01:31:57,579 --> 01:32:00,060
Turn and paddle upstream between the red and white bulls

734
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,600
struggling a little later

735
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:17,359
Leave the athlete

736
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:27,970
Uh, there's eight people here. It's gonna be a mess

737
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,579
Wait, am I cheating what happened? Why do I have a 10 second head start?

738
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:44,060
What hold on am I gonna get a penalty for that?

739
01:32:45,819 --> 01:32:48,539
It's a tricky approach into ben nevis here

740
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:51,260
Have to slow down to get through that gate

741
01:32:55,939 --> 01:32:57,939
What is just me

742
01:32:57,939 --> 01:33:02,100
Is to stay dry through this upstream gate

743
01:33:02,819 --> 01:33:07,899
While this gate proved to be a little problematic, but now what are you talking about?

744
01:33:09,739 --> 01:33:13,739
Completely missed altogether great great comes this athlete

745
01:33:22,189 --> 01:33:29,250
Did I duck under it I'm sorry, it doesn't matter what game it is

746
01:33:29,489 --> 01:33:30,689
Is

747
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:35,569
It's just all I think of is connect whenever I see a kayak or any water sport for that matter

748
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:41,489
Just just connect this is microsoft connect presents minigame. That's all I think of is just minigame microsoft connect. That's it

749
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:46,369
And it sucks because this is a really difficult thing to do. This is really hard

750
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:49,409
This is like a really just grueling sport

751
01:33:51,069 --> 01:33:53,069
And it has been dropped in my brain too

752
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:55,470
Funny connect game

753
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:08,750
That's all right, I did all right

754
01:34:09,949 --> 01:34:11,229
Brilliant

755
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:18,989
Does not look brilliant does not look like a guy that knows that he's doing this looks like you just took a guy

756
01:34:18,989 --> 01:34:20,989
From the audience and put him in here

757
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:26,750
Oh pretty good time for somebody that we just pulled from the subway

758
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:30,960
We gave him 50 dollars

759
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:38,720
He said go for it

760
01:34:40,939 --> 01:34:46,989
Well, this is the final scoreboard holy shit, I did really really well

761
01:34:49,489 --> 01:34:51,970
Well team USA with this is the important one here

762
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:58,770
Am I is this olympic little league?

763
01:34:59,329 --> 01:35:01,409
Am I in competition with like 13 year olds?

764
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:17,359
Everybody literally sucks at kayaking. It doesn't matter how good you actually are does it athletes all come through the qualifying rounds

765
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,800
All right, I gotta get a good one

766
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:28,880
This is for the medal attempt number one that good speed

767
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:34,180
Good angle and that's a snapshot moment

768
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:47,859
Right underneath the olympic record damn

769
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:52,420
Comes to a close a little too early

770
01:35:53,779 --> 01:35:55,779
A huge lead in this one

771
01:35:56,579 --> 01:36:08,130
This is the second round. Why is that so slow? This looks very good

772
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:15,569
Well, that's going to be a foul needs to stop before the line

773
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:18,609
Why did I fall down?

774
01:36:18,609 --> 01:36:24,130
A wonderful performance so far and the results on the scoreboard are just as electrifying

775
01:36:24,609 --> 01:36:29,010
They know it's a terrific terrific lead that this athlete takes from here

776
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:33,939
Third round of the javelin now

777
01:36:36,619 --> 01:36:38,619
I fell down. Is it a foul if you fall?

778
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:48,340
But he just looks stupid

779
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:51,939
Midway through this event and the USA are in first place

780
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:56,060
Throw it straight i'm trying

781
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:59,260
Fourth attempt this two more remain

782
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:02,220
Oh, this is bad

783
01:37:02,619 --> 01:37:05,420
Who cares just throw it on whatever that was a horrible one, but

784
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:12,510
You won't get close to his personal best with 50 community subs from who suck mick jones

785
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,760
Thanks for the 50 subs

786
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,680
That's insane on the scoreboard 50 community sub

787
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,949
One's for you. You ready?

788
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:29,229
This one's for the 50 subs. I'm going to break the fucking world record right here

789
01:37:32,369 --> 01:37:37,579
Next one goes up. It's high and it's long

790
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,300
Not quite the right trajectory though

791
01:37:40,779 --> 01:37:43,180
Not a great throw. We only need one to win

792
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:47,020
Okay, this is it. I'm gonna break it at least their olympic record later

793
01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:52,819
Six and final round then for this athlete

794
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,939
Nope, it wasn't going fast enough shit. Sorry

795
01:38:03,729 --> 01:38:06,100
He's in 50 subs

796
01:38:08,699 --> 01:38:10,699
That's still gold medal I still win

797
01:38:14,189 --> 01:38:16,880
Here is the replay

798
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:24,210
Let's take a look at that big one again. Yeah right below the olympic record

799
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:28,159
That line right there. Damn it

800
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:40,590
This works strong damn

801
01:38:44,029 --> 01:38:46,029
Nice work

802
01:38:48,909 --> 01:38:51,140
Well

803
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:55,859
I just I didn't mean to skip it. I pressed x way too early and I skipped it accidentally

804
01:38:57,229 --> 01:38:59,229
Time for the gold medal and kayaking

805
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:07,739
Don't worry, we're gonna hear it right here because i'm gonna get the goddamn gold medal

806
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:14,880
All right, come on kevin

807
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:26,779
Come on kevin, let's go

808
01:39:33,859 --> 01:39:40,579
Well, that shows the control of the kayak the way this athlete's leaning leaning very hard to one side here

809
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,460
Moving nicely through the first time check

810
01:39:44,659 --> 01:39:47,380
Well, the next gate is against the current it's upstream

811
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:58,029
Made hard work of that gate

812
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:06,579
Completely and utterly missed that gate. All right, we're good through two sections

813
01:40:07,539 --> 01:40:09,539
Clean through that last gate

814
01:40:09,539 --> 01:40:12,420
Well, this is all about timing through the oval

815
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:18,880
Come on needs to keep on top of the white water through this upstream gate

816
01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:23,779
Did well to get through that gate

817
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:35,180
There will be some disappointment because this athlete has picked up a few penalties here

818
01:40:35,899 --> 01:40:40,220
Maybe this athlete can take some consolation out of a good final section

819
01:40:40,699 --> 01:40:42,859
Needs to improve on the performance so far

820
01:40:43,659 --> 01:40:46,699
This is the last big drop of the course. It's a big bet

821
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:51,579
Well, it took an awful lot of hard working effort, but eventually got through that. Yeah, that's a finish

822
01:40:54,029 --> 01:40:56,029
That's gotta be decent

823
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:04,329
9199

824
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:11,329
Well, it's a good start to this one very very smooth going down the road

825
01:41:12,909 --> 01:41:15,090
Negotiating some of the hazards very well here

826
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:19,250
Looks good looks very good at this stage

827
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:24,420
Not at all time to paddle powerfully not even close

828
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:27,460
This is good. What's bad?

829
01:41:33,819 --> 01:41:36,460
Oh the smoothness is just absolutely smooth

830
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:54,300
Any medal is a good medal when you come to the olympic games and the celebrations of this athlete will tell you exactly that

831
01:41:54,699 --> 01:41:56,699
Oh bronze medal

832
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:04,479
What was it? What was your score?

833
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:07,260
What was the score? Why didn't see what was the score?

834
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,880
What was the score I want to I want to see the score I want to see the actual score

835
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:24,819
What brings to a close another fantastic day of competition here at the lee valley whitewater center

836
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:27,960
I hope you've enjoyed it as much as me from seth bennett

837
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:35,069
God damn it

838
01:42:35,069 --> 01:42:38,560
I wanted to see how much time they had against me

839
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:43,460
Let's take a look here. We got

840
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,539
The united states china's got two gold medals now

841
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:49,390
two bronze medals

842
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:59,569
Bronze are gonna mad up in the end

843
01:42:59,569 --> 01:43:02,189
100 women's skeet

844
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:06,000
And i'm gonna do the breaststroke

845
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:13,869
This is definitely just tap as fast as possible

846
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:15,949
But no way it's not

847
01:43:15,949 --> 01:43:27,140
That's all you need to know

848
01:43:33,149 --> 01:43:35,550
I don't know why I was like looking at the other monitor over here for a second

849
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:39,229
I thought they were all naked like actual just completely butt naked. I was like what the hell

850
01:43:40,029 --> 01:43:42,029
And then all right. Yeah, they're with a little underwear

851
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:51,180
How does this work?

852
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:52,220
go

853
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,720
die

854
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,800
Tap x repeatedly while underwater

855
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:01,390
Hold down to swim

856
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:32,210
Square press the correct button the final boost press x at the end of the race to lunge for the wall

857
01:44:33,619 --> 01:44:37,220
Time each stroke to when both arms are fully extended to build the most speed

858
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:43,359
All right

859
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,760
Go lance

860
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:54,800
Press x a knowledgeable push descends. No, what if you lunge hard and slam into the wall?

861
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:03,619
What oh

862
01:45:18,619 --> 01:45:20,619
Focus there's the l and r up here

863
01:46:02,819 --> 01:46:06,340
This just reminds me of those old shows where you know talk about the

864
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:08,899
You got the hot dog eating contest the guy with the bear

865
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:11,920
This is like this is like the man versus the otter

866
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:17,979
And we make sure we give the otter. Well, let's take a final look five seconds before

867
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:23,659
I got five second head start on the otter. I was the otter out of the olympic games in this event

868
01:46:23,899 --> 01:46:25,899
Not good. I'm afraid for team usa

869
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:41,279
Bears shouldn't eat hot dogs. No, they really shouldn't tell that to like late 90s television

870
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,640
They thought they sure thought it was real funny

871
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:59,649
All right, i'm gonna do this well

872
01:46:59,649 --> 01:47:02,180
Oh shit

873
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:03,939
I'm gonna do so well here

874
01:47:03,939 --> 01:47:10,939
The reticule will shrink when the targeting to hit track the targets move before shooting for the best result

875
01:47:10,939 --> 01:47:12,939
I'll always shoot the yellow target first

876
01:47:13,579 --> 01:47:25,260
Okay petition these athletes equally match not much between them

877
01:47:28,699 --> 01:47:31,659
Well, here we are on station one first up the single

878
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:41,060
Almost blew that one

879
01:47:41,539 --> 01:47:51,890
Here comes a double let's have a look on the double whatever

880
01:47:52,130 --> 01:48:01,010
Locked in the shooting. Come on. I gotta do this. Well only one

881
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:08,260
Fuck I missed out with that last shot

882
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:18,960
Looking for the double hit

883
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:22,239
That's tricky

884
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:34,460
Just a single right what happened it

885
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:41,439
Just didn't react fast enough to that first target I think it's the r2 is messed up. I really mean that

886
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:54,079
It's a good round and there's no doubt now

887
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:58,239
That this competitor can have the confidence that they can keep up with the leaders here

888
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:05,010
I feel like that's a weird way to hold a gun. It's like let it rest on your shoulder

889
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:14,260
Ah, it's a bit disappointing that's open like that from the high house

890
01:49:16,109 --> 01:49:22,430
Well station number four asks a lot of the shooters first a high single then a low single followed by

891
01:49:25,630 --> 01:49:28,350
That's how you hold a rifle you have it like open like that over your shoulder

892
01:49:32,829 --> 01:49:43,409
Yeah, I can't say i've ever held a rifle before in my life, but what the hell did I know this is the double

893
01:49:44,050 --> 01:49:56,979
I think I got the hang of it

894
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:12,819
Just got to wait stay in the middle and see where it goes two more targets still to hit

895
01:50:13,859 --> 01:50:17,699
It came out fast very fast

896
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:23,810
You're saying hog

897
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:44,659
There's another one

898
01:50:45,619 --> 01:50:56,180
First close i'll give it to you

899
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:01,619
If you close your eyes block your ears and yell really loud I guess it's pretty close

900
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:21,579
The person in last place only hit one target did they

901
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:29,600
Yeah, they did

902
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,600
What's the excuse there? Do you think?

903
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:38,239
I think the next day you fake an illness right the next day after the olympics you go like god turns out

904
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:40,880
Yeah, I got I had like fucking wicked bad diarrhea

905
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:45,810
Yeah, I was like I had like I was like wicked fucking sick with diarrhea and shit

906
01:51:46,449 --> 01:51:52,909
Like this that's that's what I would do like I tried my best right?

907
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:58,850
But I mean I was feeling terrible

908
01:52:12,819 --> 01:52:16,420
If you say wicked again, I will sub for real that'd be wicked cool if you did

909
01:52:16,899 --> 01:52:19,460
And i'll stop station number eight

910
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,180
Nope

911
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:43,079
All right now let's make it really happen give a solution to any social issue just saying he has diarrhea

912
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:45,380
That's an incredibly easy to understand thing

913
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:49,020
There's no nuance there. It's just

914
01:52:49,819 --> 01:52:51,819
I have diarrhea

915
01:52:52,939 --> 01:52:58,539
You don't have to explain that you don't have to tell anybody anything. It is no beginning. There's no middle. There's no end. There's only

916
01:52:59,579 --> 01:53:01,949
Diarrhea everybody understands it

917
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:06,380
And it's a thing that nobody wants to question either

918
01:53:06,859 --> 01:53:23,859
First up station number one, although be careful using it that often next up. It's the double high house first

919
01:53:24,579 --> 01:53:30,189
Oh, I thought I missed it

920
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:50,029
That's good, I like it

921
01:53:50,029 --> 01:53:51,550
Or if you hit one, you know

922
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:54,590
I mean if back in the day when there wasn't really any cameras here

923
01:53:54,909 --> 01:54:01,340
I would just say I tried to do with my eyes closed. Oh, all right. Damn. Holy shit. Yeah, I tried

924
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:04,619
I got one that's impressive

925
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:23,649
Put him on the screen

926
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:29,569
Putting the pressure on at the top of the scoreboard, but there are two or three others that are very close by

927
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:32,699
Yeah, this uh

928
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:35,069
Anna and it's really close

929
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:46,699
Oh, I dropped it. Well, that was close

930
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:57,729
Station three at the double. All right, we're good. You can miss one. It's okay

931
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:06,689
Good execution on that round

932
01:55:07,729 --> 01:55:09,170
Re three three

933
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:11,170
She's been perfect. All right, I gotta be perfect here

934
01:55:11,729 --> 01:55:24,020
I want that gold medal

935
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:26,180
Well, this is a biggie station number four

936
01:55:26,819 --> 01:55:29,060
six targets in total to aim for

937
01:55:29,699 --> 01:55:34,640
Take the board down omega lul losing omega lul losing you're losing to norway

938
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:37,680
Oh looking for the double on station four

939
01:55:43,810 --> 01:55:48,850
I'm gonna don't i'm gonna delete those channel points if you keep using them

940
01:55:49,970 --> 01:56:01,069
This is the double don't do it. Have you guys even seen the new emotes yet?

941
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:07,680
This place at the midway point for team usa and things definitely going to plan

942
01:56:08,699 --> 01:56:18,100
Can we see the new emotes please? I want to do the diving competition

943
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,260
I feel like I would be really good at that one. What can she do on this double?

944
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:33,260
That was good. That was clean

945
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:35,899
I I really I ran away with it here 17 to 13

946
01:56:36,539 --> 01:56:42,670
I can relax

947
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:46,000
Yeah, it's all right. I can miss

948
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:52,399
German punching or why are you doing the punching shit? This is the double low house first

949
01:57:01,409 --> 01:57:03,840
This looks like a lot of fun

950
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:10,159
It's the end of the round now on the scoreboard has a really but is it weird that I don't want a rifle

951
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:12,239
I want a plate shooter

952
01:57:13,229 --> 01:57:16,029
I want to shoot the clay plates with clay plates

953
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:29,390
Like tribes. Yeah

954
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:32,350
I just I want to try to play this shooter gun

955
01:57:33,229 --> 01:57:38,430
Try to hit the other that'd be awesome. Well, it's been a good performance for the usa. That'd be so hard

956
01:57:39,229 --> 01:57:42,909
And this is a shotgun. Yeah, but I I don't I want a plate gun

957
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:55,859
Somebody that knows explain it to me. I thought shotguns were

958
01:57:56,899 --> 01:57:58,899
really low range

959
01:57:58,899 --> 01:58:05,859
There are two targets here on offer that can be hit. Will it be enough though to win a medal? This is station number eight

960
01:58:07,739 --> 01:58:11,020
It's just a big spread don't they just the pellets all spread out like all over the place

961
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:13,100
I guess that's kind of the point

962
01:58:15,569 --> 01:58:17,569
That's just video game logic

963
01:58:19,819 --> 01:58:21,340
Really?

964
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:25,979
I thought that you shot like this like

965
01:58:26,859 --> 01:58:28,859
Bird shot

966
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:33,579
It blows up out of the gun and it just goes

967
01:58:34,619 --> 01:58:39,170
Oh, that's cool. It's called bird shop because they shoot birds in the air

968
01:58:39,970 --> 01:58:44,159
How can I live in america and not know anything about guns?

969
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,060
I don't know. I don't I don't like use them

970
01:58:58,430 --> 01:59:00,670
Just because just because you're in america doesn't mean that

971
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:04,350
I have like four shotguns

972
01:59:04,909 --> 01:59:11,310
And these moments will be captured and will be on the front pages of the papers in the morning I got six gold

973
01:59:12,189 --> 01:59:14,189
terrific performance

974
01:59:16,779 --> 01:59:18,779
I've kicked a gun before

975
01:59:20,739 --> 01:59:22,739
That seems like a bad idea

976
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:28,979
I'm, not sure that's smart. We got high jump

977
01:59:31,979 --> 01:59:35,739
Table tennis. Oh, yeah, this is gonna be great. I can't wait

978
01:59:36,619 --> 01:59:49,149
And it's really high jump. How does high jump work? You just jump as high as you can somebody measures it

979
01:59:49,869 --> 01:59:52,510
I don't think i've ever seen this

980
01:59:52,510 --> 01:59:56,430
Wait, is this thing where they jump they arch their back and they like slime their legs around the bar

981
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:59,310
This thing's insane if this is what I think it is

982
02:00:01,869 --> 02:00:05,140
Yep, this is yep. This is it

983
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:06,260
Fill the bar

984
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:16,060
Those these ones are so hard to do flick when the athlete reaches the white marker

985
02:00:16,699 --> 02:00:20,340
Press x to kick your legs and avoid the bar

986
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:27,180
60 degrees is perfect jump

987
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:35,630
Right

988
02:00:46,659 --> 02:00:54,000
Nobody can jump over that nobody can jump over this. This is like 15 feet high. How big is this?

989
02:01:24,289 --> 02:01:26,289
Who the fuck was able to do that

990
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:39,970
Having under the bar only gets you onto the outtakes of this olympic games

991
02:01:42,819 --> 02:01:44,899
Here's the replay

992
02:01:44,899 --> 02:01:48,819
Well, here we go attempt number three looking for better things. I can't lower it

993
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:04,050
What the fuck?

994
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:10,159
Welcome huge disappointment for team usa

995
02:02:13,229 --> 02:02:20,909
This is the olympic stadium welcome one of the most sustainable ever built the low ball is set into the existing landscape

996
02:02:21,069 --> 02:02:23,069
Well, wait, the world record is 209

997
02:02:24,899 --> 02:02:29,939
Why did I think I could jump over 2.6 if the world record?

998
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:32,500
Is 209

999
02:02:36,579 --> 02:02:38,739
Why are you even allowed to put it this high?

1000
02:02:46,739 --> 02:02:49,140
You got to be kidding me. All right, i'm coming down

1001
02:02:50,350 --> 02:02:56,159
to

1002
02:02:56,159 --> 02:03:00,000
171 80

1003
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:10,140
There it is

1004
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:22,939
That was close I could have gone a little higher which country you want to win the gold medal in this event

1005
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:27,579
You've got to respect the stuff that athletes made to this competition 190. Let's go

1006
02:03:28,859 --> 02:03:31,500
Is this the poker event in the olympics? Let's go

1007
02:03:38,659 --> 02:03:46,850
Oh, I got it

1008
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:50,050
I'm going i'm going for 210

1009
02:03:55,140 --> 02:04:01,699
First place a stunning start to this competition really laying down the benchmark for everyone else to follow

1010
02:04:07,710 --> 02:04:20,880
Oh shit, what happened? I didn't even see a replay

1011
02:04:41,899 --> 02:04:44,140
Nice approach why can I not lower it?

1012
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:13,699
After three rounds not they're not gonna give me any fanfare for that. I just beat the I just did the world record

1013
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:28,449
I can't lower it. Wait, once I beat the world record everyone's like no, no, no, no, you gotta go higher

1014
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:34,079
No one's gonna be able to do this

1015
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:39,920
Anybody else has street of this sport until five minutes ago record attempt

1016
02:05:44,699 --> 02:05:52,319
Is a good take we gotta go higher than that. Come on man

1017
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,739
A stutter in the run-up will have cost this athlete

1018
02:06:06,699 --> 02:06:11,140
No chance of going clear when you hit the bar that hard

1019
02:06:11,779 --> 02:06:17,409
This is a limbo, you know, you have to go over rather than under the bar

1020
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:22,210
Here's the replay. I just imagine like

1021
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:25,090
You head off the side of the bar

1022
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:29,649
Again, this is world record in the qualifiers, right?

1023
02:06:30,689 --> 02:06:34,060
I didn't win anything

1024
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:44,289
All right, as long as I continuously clear two

1025
02:06:45,779 --> 02:06:47,779
I'm gonna start at one

1026
02:06:47,859 --> 02:06:59,729
They've moved on nicely through to the olympic tennis event i'm intrigued by this one

1027
02:07:00,449 --> 02:07:09,060
This is the excel london and next up the semi-finals of the men's table tennis

1028
02:07:11,470 --> 02:07:15,149
I love ping pong. It's I love it. I'm terrible at it

1029
02:07:16,109 --> 02:07:23,310
I consider going back and forth three times a victory before somebody goes. Oh too hard goes into the ceiling

1030
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:25,310
Whoops, just get it again, man. We'll do it again

1031
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:29,939
Going one two three. Oh, that was fun. I don't know how people do it that hard

1032
02:07:29,939 --> 02:07:31,939
I don't know if the star does this shit

1033
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:36,670
Just like the didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't I can't even I can't see that fast

1034
02:07:36,829 --> 02:07:39,970
I can't even see that fast. It's impossible

1035
02:07:40,449 --> 02:07:44,420
Push it for a straight top spin

1036
02:07:44,579 --> 02:07:50,659
Aim to the left. So it's just timing

1037
02:07:52,449 --> 02:07:53,970
Aim to the right

1038
02:07:53,970 --> 02:07:56,189
It's for backspin

1039
02:07:56,189 --> 02:08:09,699
Oh, you can move press r quickly rotate towards r to add right spin

1040
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:19,869
Okay, I need to read seven points with a two-point lead

1041
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:39,359
Usa versus france peter ko. Oh peter ko. Okay, I made this name for a second

1042
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:56,800
It's a great reception here for our two competitors slows the rally down with a side spin

1043
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:03,550
Oh what happened

1044
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:21,039
Come on this is so awkward. Okay

1045
02:09:30,689 --> 02:09:32,850
Starting to build

1046
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:34,850
Fantastic backhand I get it

1047
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:37,329
Hit the corner of the table. They hit the corner of the table. I got the corner

1048
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:55,359
Let's be taking a battering. It's another point lost. This is the resident evil tank controls

1049
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:59,100
They're like killing me

1050
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:17,340
It's right across the table with a forehand. Just don't get yourself into trouble got a one by two. Remember that's important to remember

1051
02:10:24,899 --> 02:10:35,899
So the rally's starting to take shape

1052
02:10:35,899 --> 02:10:41,739
Fantastic rally kept alive. Why are we both treating this like it's a bug flying around the room you're getting away from me

1053
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:59,390
Shit by my face

1054
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,390
Yeah, we're paying 10. Got him

1055
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:10,880
Does anybody else feel like the table should be raised like a full foot we're really hunching down here

1056
02:11:22,319 --> 02:11:24,319
beautifully on the backhand side

1057
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:31,869
Places the ball with the backhand. Oh, did you see that curve to win the point at this?

1058
02:11:32,670 --> 02:11:36,130
Wait, how did I get that correct?

1059
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:58,699
Oh, yes, oh did he get it on the edge you mother fucker. No, we did not

1060
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:10,529
Help he cannot you gotta win by two points

1061
02:12:12,609 --> 02:12:14,609
Oh shit the camera thing

1062
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:25,550
Fuck i'm sorry

1063
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:27,550
So the rally really starting to take shape

1064
02:12:43,939 --> 02:12:47,779
But he really needs to focus now. Here we go with the first serve of the second game

1065
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:53,649
All right, let's say all right this i'm talking about look at how high the guy on the right's chair is

1066
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:59,069
Why don't they just put a couple of books underneath the table to make it be like four or five inches higher

1067
02:12:59,069 --> 02:13:02,779
We're all like leaning down here. Is it why does it have to be this low?

1068
02:13:22,859 --> 02:13:24,859
That's not good

1069
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:31,579
Yeah, I yeah, I know I said it first that means I I can say it's fine I can say it first

1070
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:44,640
Why am I acting like this

1071
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:51,470
Look at the way that i'm volleying this back and forth

1072
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:55,329
I don't get it. So i'm trying

1073
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,079
It's too weird. It's too weird. It's fucking weird. It's weird. All right, it's weird

1074
02:14:06,899 --> 02:14:08,340
Yeah, let me explain this

1075
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:13,170
Okay, imagine this is a gta 5 mini game that you can pull up to right?

1076
02:14:13,250 --> 02:14:18,159
That's how this feels like to play it feels like this is a gta 5 game. You know, let's put golf in

1077
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:21,520
Let's put like this in yeah, this was this was like, yep. Yep. Yep

1078
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:28,850
Take all blame away from me

1079
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:46,460
And this is where we come back

1080
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:55,149
What a shame he's trailing here and the difference between the two players is getting bigger

1081
02:15:00,029 --> 02:15:04,430
How do you miss that why are you just like swatting at it for some answers?

1082
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:12,020
Why that was so just violent and just incorrect the serve is crucial

1083
02:15:12,659 --> 02:15:21,979
Pressure on they take the point. Where can they go from here point now? Can they get that place moved back?

1084
02:15:22,539 --> 02:15:42,430
The olympic action from here for the moment seth benet will now wrap up the results

1085
02:15:43,869 --> 02:15:47,489
You only get so many world records for the day, okay

1086
02:15:56,300 --> 02:15:58,100
Okay

1087
02:15:58,100 --> 02:16:00,819
We need I have the I currently have the world record

1088
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:08,100
My world it's 210. Why does nobody care that the record's 210?

1089
02:16:08,659 --> 02:16:10,659
We're starting at one nine. We're starting at two

1090
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:22,609
Looking for a solid effort here and go no one's ever gonna do that. I'm the only one on earth that can do that

1091
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:30,670
Now I have

1092
02:16:30,829 --> 02:16:32,540
at least

1093
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:35,659
Four or five attempts to break my world record

1094
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:48,780
This is the current record while this bar is getting ever so high now

1095
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:55,139
This would require a great lead you stupid asshole to get this world record

1096
02:16:57,059 --> 02:17:00,659
I have the world record. What do you mean get the world record? I currently have it

1097
02:17:09,389 --> 02:17:11,389
Yeah

1098
02:17:18,719 --> 02:17:20,719
The heel

1099
02:17:20,959 --> 02:17:51,459
Who cares kicking any point at the world record I got the world record last time why nobody care about this

1100
02:18:31,569 --> 02:18:36,370
All right, I got seven medals i'm doing very good men's table tennis

1101
02:18:36,690 --> 02:18:37,889
I

1102
02:18:37,889 --> 02:18:41,579
Am I in the finals for the men's table tennis? I just got beat

1103
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:44,760
absolutely horrible

1104
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:46,940
Why am I in the final?

1105
02:18:46,940 --> 02:18:48,940
I still qualified

1106
02:19:00,450 --> 02:19:02,450
I'm done

1107
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:08,049
Why did I qualify well take advantage of it take advantage just like the fucked up rules just let's try to win

1108
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:12,700
Take that it shouldn't be it should be legal

1109
02:19:13,979 --> 02:19:31,100
Shouldn't like the white should not it shouldn't be painted white. I don't know to keep the rally going

1110
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:36,239
Wow, that backhand what a joy to watch

1111
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:40,979
It's a real mess of that back. All right, that was like a wiffle ball

1112
02:19:42,350 --> 02:19:44,350
Forehand back across the net

1113
02:19:44,590 --> 02:19:46,899
Backhand will test his opponent

1114
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:51,360
Oh, he's gonna be disappointed with that forehand

1115
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:56,610
He seemed a long way out of position there. There was just no way he was gonna return it

1116
02:19:56,610 --> 02:19:59,299
It

1117
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:10,719
A little shimmy. Oh, okay rally starting to build

1118
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:13,680
It's the forehand back over the net

1119
02:20:14,909 --> 02:20:16,909
Forehand keeps the rally. Yeah

1120
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:32,299
Damn it. Well, his opponent was just simply too good for him there and he'll lose the point

1121
02:20:35,899 --> 02:20:39,979
There we go. All right, I got I can I can beat this enjoying it as much as the crowd are

1122
02:20:40,379 --> 02:20:42,700
But he will take the confidence from that point

1123
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:52,540
Nope, nope, nope, it's tagging

1124
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:56,459
First x for a special. I don't think I have spent one. It's not real

1125
02:20:57,420 --> 02:21:08,500
Starting to get into the game as the rally starts building there is definitely no argument there at all

1126
02:21:08,739 --> 02:21:11,139
He wins the point with that fantastic play

1127
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:15,340
I don't know why I keep going for but you have to

1128
02:21:15,659 --> 02:21:24,459
This rally really starting to take shape now

1129
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:29,020
Using his backhand spike it a fantastic forehand there

1130
02:21:32,139 --> 02:21:34,139
Loses the point there with that play

1131
02:21:35,569 --> 02:21:38,290
Oh the stupid plastic ball in on the other idiot's side

1132
02:21:38,850 --> 02:21:40,850
Good job. What are you saying?

1133
02:21:44,799 --> 02:22:00,750
Wait, is this just like a complete just you just tearing ping pong apart. Yeah spike it plays the forehand there

1134
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:03,700
Forehand keeps the game in play

1135
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:06,379
I'll be disappointed with that forehand

1136
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:09,020
All right spike it

1137
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:27,819
I need one more point and I win and he start to really build a significant lead now got it. Yes

1138
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:34,239
Wait, is this just going to be a straight how many games do I have to play?

1139
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:38,719
How many games of table tennis do I have to play?

1140
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:50,129
That's the three but it but who is this are we the two best in the world or is this just for like seventh place?

1141
02:22:50,610 --> 02:22:58,989
How does this work looking to force the errors? Is this for bronze?

1142
02:22:59,870 --> 02:23:09,579
I'll get it

1143
02:23:09,579 --> 02:23:14,620
This rally really starting to take shape now. There it is. Good. He's got to be pleased with that the point is

1144
02:23:15,579 --> 02:23:18,860
Does this look like the work of the best in the world? No, it does not

1145
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:27,200
I did really well there to force his opponent sara. He'll take the point with that

1146
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:33,540
Can I take the bronze medal and then just say i'm done?

1147
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:38,579
I don't even want the gold one. You just gives this. I don't even want to attempt. It's gonna go in the stands into play

1148
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:42,420
Asking the questions with a backhand

1149
02:23:42,819 --> 02:23:51,680
What an incredible rally the crowd are really loving this to see he wins the point there with some fantastic approach play

1150
02:23:55,409 --> 02:23:56,770
That was awesome

1151
02:23:56,770 --> 02:23:59,889
How did I do that with my backhand? I did it with the other side of the panel

1152
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:13,459
I really is starting to play to the crowd now and they are responding. What a fantastic point one

1153
02:24:17,739 --> 02:24:18,860
Ah

1154
02:24:18,860 --> 02:24:22,379
Thought it was going out of bounds. He just couldn't return it successfully

1155
02:24:31,260 --> 02:24:33,500
No speed lost on the ball there with the backhand

1156
02:24:34,379 --> 02:24:40,770
What a fantastic point here we go then serving for that. This is it. Can he take it? I will take it

1157
02:24:41,649 --> 02:24:45,920
I didn't get to the head

1158
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:49,309
And he'll lose that point

1159
02:24:49,309 --> 02:24:51,309
This is waving to somebody in the crowd. What was that?

1160
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
So the rally really starting to take shape

1161
02:25:00,239 --> 02:25:02,959
Really can't afford to lose any focus now with this rally

1162
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:06,719
This is the point going to come from in this rally

1163
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:09,680
What about this is the point of all of this?

1164
02:25:15,219 --> 02:25:26,319
Shit come on i'm starting to get into the game as the rally starts building

1165
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:29,760
Both players really matching each other now with this rally

1166
02:25:30,399 --> 02:25:33,860
Give me that bronze

1167
02:25:33,860 --> 02:25:35,540
Give me the bronze

1168
02:25:35,540 --> 02:25:39,950
Give me the bronze

1169
02:25:55,739 --> 02:25:57,739
Is it

1170
02:25:59,469 --> 02:26:01,950
I came in first I came in third place

1171
02:26:07,069 --> 02:26:09,069
Bronze medal

1172
02:26:09,469 --> 02:26:17,790
Appreciate how hard they've worked. I'm just realizing the name of the stream is called silver medals and I don't have any

1173
02:26:19,549 --> 02:26:22,850
I have three bronze medals like six gold medals

1174
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:31,389
Well, this place is rocking

1175
02:26:31,629 --> 02:26:33,629
And quite rightly so

1176
02:26:34,129 --> 02:26:37,090
The sheer joy and ecstasy on his face

1177
02:26:37,649 --> 02:26:40,770
Tells you everything you need to know about how much winning

1178
02:26:43,459 --> 02:26:45,219
All right, let's go

1179
02:26:45,219 --> 02:26:47,219
Let's take a look at the tallies here

1180
02:26:48,049 --> 02:26:49,250
China

1181
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:51,250
18 the dude getting a lot of silvers

1182
02:26:51,889 --> 02:27:03,409
I gotta start to be ready here

1183
02:27:03,409 --> 02:27:06,270
women's

1184
02:27:06,270 --> 02:27:08,930
springboard

1185
02:27:08,930 --> 02:27:11,010
men's 100 men's 400

1186
02:27:12,899 --> 02:27:14,659
no, uh

1187
02:27:14,659 --> 02:27:15,860
butterfly

1188
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:19,620
100 100 sprint. Yeah, we'll do the 100 sprint and this is the diving. I can't wait

1189
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:33,899
You own two of the 23 possible world records

1190
02:27:39,819 --> 02:27:41,819
I'm ready

1191
02:27:41,979 --> 02:27:45,280
I want to do the high this is not the high dive though, is it? No

1192
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:50,379
I'm in three meters springboard. Here comes gold medal gwen. We gotta get the gold medal

1193
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:55,889
That's x to begin the dive

1194
02:27:55,969 --> 02:28:05,520
Let's circle to enter a tough somersault

1195
02:28:07,870 --> 02:28:09,229
And then hit it again

1196
02:28:09,229 --> 02:28:11,360
Then hit down

1197
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:14,180
I wish eleanor to rotate the athlete

1198
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:18,850
To get the perfect splash

1199
02:28:20,139 --> 02:28:28,139
Okay

1200
02:28:32,459 --> 02:28:34,459
Yeah, it's all about the splash

1201
02:28:37,329 --> 02:28:38,770
We're square down

1202
02:28:38,770 --> 02:28:41,409
Well, this is quite hard not the most difficult

1203
02:28:42,209 --> 02:28:53,940
I help but wonder whether this diver has been affected by nerves. It is always a big thing to compete in olympic games

1204
02:28:55,709 --> 02:28:59,870
Almost a full-on belly flop. Take a look at the replay, but i'm sure the diver won't want to

1205
02:29:00,750 --> 02:29:10,299
They know just how badly wrong they got it low marks difficulty taken out of the equation because of the incorrect dive

1206
02:29:14,739 --> 02:29:16,739
All right, we're gonna do

1207
02:29:18,819 --> 02:29:26,690
Oh shit, okay square is it square immediately needs to compose herself. What the fuck is going on?

1208
02:29:27,409 --> 02:29:40,299
That one quickly get it straight out of her mind and move on

1209
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:43,860
It hurts so bad

1210
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:45,860
Here's the replay

1211
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:47,860
The twist was good. But after that

1212
02:29:48,979 --> 02:29:56,180
Everything else just went wrong a massive splash of water and that's one of the telltale signs that the dive didn't quite go to

1213
02:29:56,180 --> 02:29:58,180
Japan

1214
02:30:00,819 --> 02:30:02,819
You would be feeling that for months

1215
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:05,700
Okay, let me try this one more time

1216
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:07,780
We're just gonna do the easy one

1217
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:11,180
I have to qualify

1218
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:18,860
circle down

1219
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:33,200
I don't i'm not

1220
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:38,290
Look

1221
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:43,489
There's no way i'm gonna have enough to qualify. This has got to be fucking incredible. Here we go

1222
02:30:45,010 --> 02:30:49,350
Square square. Well, this is quite risky one of the tougher dives in the competition

1223
02:30:52,430 --> 02:31:00,750
Oh, yeah, i'm screaming

1224
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:07,620
No splash that's gonna be tens

1225
02:31:17,090 --> 02:31:19,170
All right, do another really difficult one

1226
02:31:21,010 --> 02:31:22,290
Here we go

1227
02:31:22,290 --> 02:31:24,290
This thing is impossible

1228
02:31:34,430 --> 02:31:37,870
A few errors in there and there will be points that are lost here

1229
02:31:40,989 --> 02:31:45,149
It's so funny. It's not even that funny, but it just is for some reason i'm trying

1230
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:56,129
Okay, wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that was fucking awesome

1231
02:31:58,610 --> 02:32:00,899
That was incredible

1232
02:32:00,899 --> 02:32:03,799
I don't get extra points for doing something a human can't do

1233
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:11,979
Okay

1234
02:32:11,979 --> 02:32:13,979
These are the final standings

1235
02:32:14,139 --> 02:32:19,979
It's an unlikely defeat for team usa. I'm sure the athlete will be extremely disappointed with the performance

1236
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:23,120
Well

1237
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:26,399
No, I can't retry. I can't I gotta tag swallow the loss

1238
02:32:28,879 --> 02:32:32,420
Those retries are for Olympic level competition

1239
02:32:33,379 --> 02:32:42,069
The old metal gwen doesn't qualify. Oh, you're gonna have to go get that name changed

1240
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:57,590
So this is just run as fast as you can yeah, I think yeah, I did this already

1241
02:33:08,159 --> 02:33:15,719
Yep, I'll I got this

1242
02:33:15,719 --> 02:33:25,829
What do you think should I do a two three second head start five second head start be a total asshole?

1243
02:33:26,690 --> 02:33:29,409
These athletes are so close in their ability

1244
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:35,600
run backwards

1245
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:40,639
Try and get an early win in this I see later you fucking toads

1246
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:57,489
Wait, doesn't doping dan already have the gold medal in the 100

1247
02:33:58,450 --> 02:34:00,450
Are we doing this again?

1248
02:34:01,729 --> 02:34:09,649
Does everything so well here look so smooth quickly into stride and then it's a case of 200. Oh

1249
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:14,500
Nobody can even

1250
02:34:19,139 --> 02:34:21,219
I'm gonna go what's the world record i'm going for it

1251
02:34:33,639 --> 02:34:35,639
nine point two six

1252
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:38,979
nine point five

1253
02:34:38,979 --> 02:34:40,979
Nine point five eight

1254
02:34:41,700 --> 02:34:43,700
Let's get it right now

1255
02:34:45,059 --> 02:34:48,579
Nine point five eight whole of these games are we gonna see a world record?

1256
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:56,399
Yep, you are

1257
02:34:56,959 --> 02:34:59,360
Who still wants it with 50 meters to go

1258
02:35:19,350 --> 02:35:23,850
And this really has been bought to life the jewel of the olympic crown

1259
02:35:24,809 --> 02:35:30,709
These are out of their blocks in the 100 meters final

1260
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:51,719
No lunging just run just forest gump style running forward

1261
02:35:53,479 --> 02:35:55,479
Just don't even stop just keep going

1262
02:35:55,639 --> 02:36:06,280
Let's have another look at this then a brilliant performance from start to finish just look great

1263
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:08,600
Through every phase of this race

1264
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:16,040
So strong with every stride and then when it came down to winning it made sure that he was high schoolers have better personal best

1265
02:36:17,479 --> 02:36:24,840
And 9.94 the world record is 9.58. You say me tell me high school track and field goes to france with a hard

1266
02:36:25,159 --> 02:36:31,750
Competers are the world records all the way. I just based this on myself

1267
02:36:32,309 --> 02:36:35,030
I did the mile in 16 minutes

1268
02:36:35,750 --> 02:36:44,010
And I just kind of walked back in high school when they timed it

1269
02:36:45,739 --> 02:36:47,979
I think I actually one year. I really did try

1270
02:36:49,030 --> 02:36:52,420
I really got ready for it

1271
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:56,899
Oh, I got put like in a wheelchair and like threw up behind a tree. I remember this have I told the story

1272
02:37:01,219 --> 02:37:03,219
I did the

1273
02:37:03,219 --> 02:37:05,459
You remember when you high school used to kind of track?

1274
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:08,120
They did like the

1275
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:10,120
Everybody's school had the different track and field

1276
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:14,520
It was like a presidential and there were two different tiers of your health

1277
02:37:15,399 --> 02:37:18,200
And it was how far can you reach how many times can you do a pull-up?

1278
02:37:18,280 --> 02:37:20,280
How many push-ups can you do you guys know this?

1279
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:28,500
Right, so it was during that it was anything under I believe eight minutes the mile

1280
02:37:29,379 --> 02:37:32,420
Anything under eight or nine minutes, I believe was eight was considered really good

1281
02:37:34,739 --> 02:37:36,899
One year, I really truly wanted to do it. Well

1282
02:37:38,100 --> 02:37:40,579
And I got ready every day. I was

1283
02:37:41,139 --> 02:37:43,780
Just trying to eat better and I wanted to try to stay loose

1284
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:46,420
And if finally the day came that we were going to do it

1285
02:37:46,819 --> 02:37:48,819
And I really gave it my all

1286
02:37:49,739 --> 02:37:52,940
I was running the whole time. I tried to get it under seven minutes

1287
02:37:53,260 --> 02:37:56,860
I believe I got of somewhere around seven minutes the mile

1288
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:03,879
And then after I was so winded and so fucked up that I I everyone was going back was gym class. Everyone was leaving

1289
02:38:04,840 --> 02:38:06,840
And I was the world started closing in

1290
02:38:07,860 --> 02:38:11,860
I just kind of sat down for a second. There was the bleachers there at the time where my high school was

1291
02:38:12,420 --> 02:38:14,420
just kind of sat and hung out there and the

1292
02:38:14,659 --> 02:38:16,739
Physical education teacher came over

1293
02:38:16,739 --> 02:38:20,659
And she said are you all right? You're doing okay. You're doing all right. I'm just like yeah fine

1294
02:38:20,659 --> 02:38:21,860
I'm fine. I'm fine

1295
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:24,500
And I ended up getting up a little bit and I ended up puking behind a tree

1296
02:38:24,659 --> 02:38:25,540
I was like, hold on a second

1297
02:38:25,540 --> 02:38:28,340
I put my hand on a tree and I just went behind it and I puked behind it

1298
02:38:28,899 --> 02:38:30,899
And she saw it and she was like, oh shit

1299
02:38:31,139 --> 02:38:33,139
I didn't say shit, but you know, i'm just paraphrasing

1300
02:38:33,299 --> 02:38:34,260
and

1301
02:38:34,260 --> 02:38:37,860
She said where you can you move or can you walk and I had to sit down

1302
02:38:38,579 --> 02:38:43,059
Maybe four or five feet away from where I just threw up with my back against another tree

1303
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:47,780
And it's just like I I got it I can't I gotta sit here for a few minutes

1304
02:38:48,340 --> 02:38:50,819
So they went and got a wheelchair and put me in the wheelchair

1305
02:38:51,459 --> 02:38:53,459
And she wheeled me through the high school

1306
02:38:55,510 --> 02:38:58,309
And i'm just like i'm fine. I'm fine everybody. I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay

1307
02:38:59,190 --> 02:39:05,129
And then finally like I got some water but just going down the hallway like with her pushing me in a wheelchair

1308
02:39:05,129 --> 02:39:07,129
It must have been just so strange to see me doing that

1309
02:39:07,930 --> 02:39:10,729
and then

1310
02:39:10,729 --> 02:39:12,729
I got some water and I went to

1311
02:39:12,969 --> 02:39:15,450
Math class with a little note that just said hey this dude

1312
02:39:15,690 --> 02:39:20,409
I don't know what it said probably two teachers talking to each other probably just like dude this dude just fucking puked behind a tree

1313
02:39:22,170 --> 02:39:24,170
It's okay that he's like eight minutes late

1314
02:39:24,569 --> 02:39:29,850
Like dash like holy shit talk to you at lunch and they probably talked a lot of they probably talked shit about me and stuff

1315
02:39:29,850 --> 02:39:31,530
I bet they did

1316
02:39:31,530 --> 02:39:42,950
He's got a golden what?

1317
02:39:42,950 --> 02:39:47,239
china

1318
02:39:47,239 --> 02:39:49,399
I got um, it's getting close

1319
02:39:52,260 --> 02:39:55,299
All right, we're gonna do the 400 meter. We're gonna do the 100 meter butterfly

1320
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:13,110
Wait, we said last time

1321
02:40:13,270 --> 02:40:18,309
You said you did it because that last time you had to run a mile you couldn't because your nutsack was all fucked up

1322
02:40:18,389 --> 02:40:19,670
Yeah, that's true

1323
02:40:19,670 --> 02:40:23,209
That's actually true

1324
02:40:23,209 --> 02:40:25,209
I had I had

1325
02:40:25,530 --> 02:40:28,649
It's true. I did I told you that what did I tell you that?

1326
02:40:30,090 --> 02:40:32,090
I told you guys about like my like

1327
02:40:32,809 --> 02:40:34,809
What did I told you about that?

1328
02:40:34,809 --> 02:40:40,870
I went to the doctor and like I was I was I thought I had they thought they had so I had some called like a

1329
02:40:41,510 --> 02:40:43,270
testic appendix

1330
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:45,270
And like my balls hurt all the time

1331
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:50,860
I when did I tell you that did I actually tell i've been around for way too long

1332
02:40:51,659 --> 02:41:08,950
All right. I got this

1333
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:17,370
It's your doctor. He screams now. He told us well, that'd be really weird if my doctor when I was like 15 was screaming right now

1334
02:41:25,270 --> 02:41:27,430
All right, I gotta really do well

1335
02:41:28,389 --> 02:41:30,389
Do well

1336
02:41:31,110 --> 02:41:38,409
He tried finding other words right onto the line really as now the athletes take to their blocks

1337
02:41:43,659 --> 02:41:46,620
As they emerge from the water, we see the early leaders

1338
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:50,540
All eight athletes very very close through 25 meters

1339
02:41:53,829 --> 02:41:56,870
And now can they lead from gun to the final touch

1340
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:06,760
Tumble turn and a strong kick off the wall. I gotta be doing really well here

1341
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:40,040
The record record olympic record

1342
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:48,600
I can do better than that

1343
02:42:53,430 --> 02:42:59,399
Who cares guys I have to have something to brag about for the next three months

1344
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:05,610
I'm going to play the game. They go like 10 gold medals and they did like three four world records

1345
02:43:07,129 --> 02:43:10,260
I need this

1346
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:22,659
Here we go ready state of the arts 80,000 in capacity and beautiful on the eye

1347
02:43:29,190 --> 02:43:37,600
Is a good performance running strongly approaching the end of the first hundred meters

1348
02:43:38,319 --> 02:43:49,360
This is not even i'm not even winded I just had a bad day i'm thinking about something really sad

1349
02:43:53,879 --> 02:43:59,000
Do I have to finish?

1350
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:10,520
Am I gonna get past do they have to wait for me to finish?

1351
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:35,850
I hope so

1352
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:38,569
I have to go few behind a tree

1353
02:44:41,930 --> 02:44:43,930
Is the ground really hot?

1354
02:44:43,930 --> 02:44:49,309
Am I walking around in bare feet?

1355
02:44:51,450 --> 02:44:57,069
Hey quick somebody get the wheelchair for him. He went way too hard in the first 10 seconds

1356
02:45:07,239 --> 02:45:09,239
It's silent

1357
02:45:29,659 --> 02:45:36,510
Yes

1358
02:45:36,510 --> 02:45:39,229
Watch the replay. I don't know if I want to watch the whole replay

1359
02:45:39,870 --> 02:45:47,549
Why are they playing? What's this music?

1360
02:45:47,790 --> 02:46:13,690
Does that break the game?

1361
02:46:24,729 --> 02:46:26,729
They won't even show me

1362
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:37,579
It was loading the replay, oh jeez

1363
02:46:41,469 --> 02:46:44,670
I almost want to do that whole thing and not even come off the

1364
02:46:46,590 --> 02:46:48,590
Just don't even start

1365
02:46:48,670 --> 02:46:51,549
And just see how long the timer will count

1366
02:46:53,850 --> 02:46:57,610
Do you think it'll count do you think the game was ever programmed to be like, oh is somebody going to sit here for 10 minutes?

1367
02:46:57,930 --> 02:47:03,850
Has seen periods of dominance for the usa in germany australia. Let's go for the world record double defending champions

1368
02:47:04,649 --> 02:47:06,329
56

1369
02:47:06,329 --> 02:47:11,049
Two lengths and about 50 seconds separates this athlete from olympic glory

1370
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:20,430
From the water and the early leaders show their heads

1371
02:47:21,309 --> 02:47:26,190
Still some distance to go but at 25 meters the early leaders in control

1372
02:47:29,469 --> 02:47:32,110
Stroke for stroke she's striving for glory

1373
02:47:36,059 --> 02:47:44,459
Strong king in the top usa in second is china in third place canada

1374
02:47:45,420 --> 02:47:49,389
Three quarters of the race come as we enter the closing stages

1375
02:47:58,690 --> 02:48:08,750
World record 56 56

1376
02:48:10,110 --> 02:48:12,110
What is it? Oh

1377
02:48:17,229 --> 02:48:21,809
In this one who was gonna win utter domination from start to finish

1378
02:48:27,170 --> 02:48:41,379
It's one second ahead of that, uh, I got the olympic record already in the qualifier

1379
02:48:42,020 --> 02:49:01,809
Enjoy that nine gold medals

1380
02:49:03,090 --> 02:49:05,840
I think this is the last day

1381
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:09,639
Did we even see all the events? I don't think we even saw the events

1382
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:12,739
This is not good

1383
02:49:12,739 --> 02:49:18,920
I've got to this last day. I've got to get two medals or i'm gonna lose first place

1384
02:49:21,280 --> 02:49:25,840
Women's freestyle and women's 100 freestyle. Oh shit. Yeah, I gotta make these good

1385
02:49:26,719 --> 02:49:39,299
China's in second place. I've got to keep it that way

1386
02:49:40,020 --> 02:49:46,930
Well, there's so much at stake here and only a tiny amount of time for these athletes to show exactly what they can do

1387
02:49:47,010 --> 02:49:51,649
Wait, this is just is on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's get a qualify

1388
02:49:51,729 --> 02:49:53,809
Look to the middle lanes for the fastest swimmers

1389
02:49:55,620 --> 02:50:07,959
Great start

1390
02:50:09,639 --> 02:50:11,639
I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it

1391
02:50:12,440 --> 02:50:20,360
All right

1392
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:23,559
I was just doing the thing where you play any game with anybody under the age of five

1393
02:50:27,329 --> 02:50:29,809
You let them win and then you kind of catch up and then you wait I lost

1394
02:50:30,290 --> 02:50:52,239
Braces, this is bad. No china didn't win. Not yet

1395
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:55,840
Here it comes

1396
02:50:56,479 --> 02:50:58,479
Old medals right now

1397
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:01,780
Here we go. Then the athletes are ready

1398
02:51:10,209 --> 02:51:16,450
Starting to take shape as we reach the quarter point now starting to stroke well at the quarter point

1399
02:51:19,459 --> 02:51:21,459
Not strong enough here

1400
02:51:25,299 --> 02:51:36,420
What are you doing at the timing on the kick that was required but still just about hanging off in second place

1401
02:51:40,549 --> 02:51:43,750
Start to hurt as we enter the final 25 meters

1402
02:51:45,829 --> 02:52:10,370
The moment for the united states seems to be drowning pretty much did go wrong technique just falling apart

1403
02:52:11,010 --> 02:52:16,850
Breathing patterns nowhere near didn't quite come up to the performance level we expected

1404
02:52:17,649 --> 02:52:25,590
These the final standings though

1405
02:52:25,989 --> 02:52:31,030
Well disappointment for the usa a surprising result as they don't qualify for the final with that

1406
02:52:41,799 --> 02:52:45,040
Yes, we still in first place

1407
02:52:50,799 --> 02:52:52,870
Yes

1408
02:52:52,870 --> 02:52:55,750
We still get why do we get first if we're tied with the same amount of points?

1409
02:53:05,379 --> 02:53:11,780
Continues to burn here at the olympic stadium in london, but it has been a quite terrific games

1410
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:19,540
The performances have been every bit what you'd expect from the biggest show in the world of sport

1411
02:53:20,500 --> 02:53:26,659
So many iconic landmarks that have just become part and parcel. I want to do the other events. There's a bunch of other events

1412
02:53:27,219 --> 02:53:33,780
Really brought to the table the flags wave in celebration after so many good performances

1413
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:36,420
Old takes priority

1414
02:53:38,340 --> 02:53:43,219
The nations coming together as one for the last time at the 2012 games

1415
02:53:45,139 --> 02:53:54,020
The city has hosted this magnificently and this closing ceremony really does signify how the whole of the world has come together here

1416
02:53:54,979 --> 02:53:59,879
This is on medium hard has been unlocked

1417
02:54:09,459 --> 02:54:16,739
What is that structure i've seen in the background a bunch of times that what's that what's that structure the heart and soul of these games

1418
02:54:18,159 --> 02:54:25,200
the red one

1419
02:54:26,610 --> 02:54:28,610
That thing right there

1420
02:54:31,270 --> 02:54:33,510
We kept it kept on like showing that from different angles

1421
02:54:33,590 --> 02:54:37,430
And go deep into the london night, I thought that was a roller coaster

1422
02:54:39,829 --> 02:54:41,110
Thank you for joining us

1423
02:54:41,110 --> 02:54:43,989
I was in the distance. I was like, wait, what is that? I thought it was a roller coaster

1424
02:54:44,790 --> 02:54:47,829
Oh, it was like, oh, there's like a park over here. There's like wherever the stadium in london is

1425
02:54:48,790 --> 02:54:51,399
It's not big ben

1426
02:54:51,399 --> 02:54:57,409
All right. Hold on. Let's say events play

1427
02:54:57,889 --> 02:54:59,489

1430
02:55:05,909 --> 02:55:07,909
men's synchronized

1431
02:55:07,909 --> 02:55:09,909
What is that? What do you mean synchronized?

1432
02:55:11,489 --> 02:55:12,530
field

1433
02:55:12,530 --> 02:55:14,530
Long jump. We didn't do shot put

1434
02:55:16,129 --> 02:55:18,129
Crack we didn't do hurdles either

1435
02:55:20,200 --> 02:55:23,520
All right. I want to do hurdles

1436
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:27,040
hurdles

1437
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:27,840

Triple jump and shot put yeah

02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,479
Let's see. What else do back backstroke?

1440
02:55:38,040 --> 02:55:40,680
I think i'm pretty good at that. Uh, what else is there in here?

1441
02:55:41,399 --> 02:55:44,850
Okay, I want three meter

1442

on hard

1447
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:01,159
Pair as individuals or pair up into national teams

1448
02:56:02,819 --> 02:56:13,299
What either two or four players must join?

1449
02:56:13,860 --> 02:56:18,719
Why can I do individual?

1450
02:56:18,719 --> 02:56:22,159
Oh, because it's okay. Okay, right because it's a synchronized

1451
02:56:22,719 --> 02:56:25,409
This is the synchronized shit can't be in here

1452
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:41,270
Take them off

1453
02:56:41,270 --> 02:56:43,270
Okay, no synchronized

1454
02:56:43,270 --> 02:56:48,520
I'm now what diving that's diving shooting rapid fire ski

1455
02:56:49,079 --> 02:56:51,079
I already did those archery

1456
02:56:51,239 --> 02:56:55,239
All right, you know already did gymnastics men's trampoline men's vault

1457
02:56:56,739 --> 02:56:59,170
other sports

1458
02:56:59,170 --> 02:57:00,610
skulls

1459
02:57:00,610 --> 02:57:03,620
I have no idea what skulls is

1460
02:57:03,780 --> 02:57:18,239
Do weightlifting again? I will

1461
02:57:18,399 --> 02:57:28,979
Let's do these ones first. I already beat the game. I don't have to do it again. We're doing just the extra stuff

1462
02:57:29,780 --> 02:57:31,780
Hurdles, I actually want to do some of my theories

1463
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:39,600
Okay, so how a doping dan obviously he's got two or three gold medals, so how does this work?

1464
02:57:40,239 --> 02:57:48,280
Okay, press x

1465
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:50,280
You tap same way you do all the other ones

1466
02:57:51,239 --> 02:57:53,600
Press as you approach the hurdle

1467
02:58:05,780 --> 02:58:13,540
Body bounce off of it. I get it. See if I can beat them all let me say you're gonna play fall guys. Yes

1468
02:58:14,100 --> 02:58:16,709
Just not today

1469
02:58:16,709 --> 02:58:18,709
We'll do that probably next we'll do that probably on monday

1470
02:58:23,799 --> 02:58:26,440
Plan on monday afternoon fall guys

1471
02:58:32,979 --> 02:58:38,079
Well, here we go then a great ovation for all eight athletes, but now so

1472
02:58:38,879 --> 02:58:43,159
Good start to this and that's vital in the field of this standard

1473
02:58:43,799 --> 02:58:49,680
50 meters to go

1474
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:55,520
This is much harder than it looks

1475
02:59:05,350 --> 02:59:07,350
So much to analyze

1476
02:59:07,430 --> 02:59:10,149
The stride was choppy. It wasn't smooth

1477
02:59:10,469 --> 02:59:15,909
They didn't really get into rhythm and come the final few meters were nowhere really to be seen

1478
02:59:17,110 --> 02:59:22,229
How far he's his legs are just spreading there. What the hell has a cool car. All right, whatever

1479
02:59:23,430 --> 02:59:25,479
Next event

1480
02:59:25,479 --> 02:59:30,760
Usually three steps then jump the timing is half the battle. Yeah, I probably feel like it'd be very difficult

1481
02:59:31,639 --> 02:59:36,549
What's his next one? I don't remember

1482
02:59:37,110 --> 02:59:43,670
Well, the conditions triple jump right for some long distance jumping here. It's the triple. What the hell does this work?

1483
02:59:44,389 --> 02:59:53,139
Mm-hmm. So then you go

1484
02:59:54,610 --> 03:00:01,799
run

1485
03:00:01,799 --> 03:00:04,840
Wait, oh this is oh, this is uh, this is a mario thing you get to go like what?

1486
03:00:06,200 --> 03:00:09,440
Right, I get it

1487
03:00:24,579 --> 03:00:28,709
That wasn't bad gonna call me on fault

1488
03:00:35,569 --> 03:00:37,750
Not terrible not awful

1489
03:00:40,450 --> 03:00:42,450
Yeah, thanks for saying everything I said

1490
03:00:52,370 --> 03:00:54,370
He's too hard

1491
03:01:05,250 --> 03:01:07,250
This meter makes no sense

1492
03:01:13,620 --> 03:01:16,760
Thirdly through this competition

1493
03:01:27,170 --> 03:01:31,569
Needs to do well here, it's all right. I did that was like something

1494
03:01:49,489 --> 03:01:51,489
This is not even it's impossible

1495
03:01:54,049 --> 03:01:56,850
Probably gave away too much distance early on

1496
03:01:57,809 --> 03:02:03,250
The seventh after that round and the scoreboard confirms there's still plenty of work to do early

1497
03:02:03,889 --> 03:02:06,129
Well, this is the final attempt for this athlete

1498
03:02:13,700 --> 03:02:15,700
That's got to be at least worthy of anything

1499
03:02:16,420 --> 03:02:18,420
That's worthy of something

1500
03:02:18,420 --> 03:02:31,090
Thanks a stunning jump

1501
03:02:33,379 --> 03:02:35,379
Not doing so well to start

1502
03:02:35,780 --> 03:02:48,120
That was dumb. I don't want to do that one anymore shot. Now. This is what i'm talking about. I'm ready for this

1503
03:02:48,680 --> 03:02:58,469
This is where I make my money

1504
03:02:58,469 --> 03:03:03,090
rapidly tap x

1505
03:03:03,090 --> 03:03:11,540
Push not throwing straight loses power push up perfect throwing it was 35 degrees

1506
03:03:12,260 --> 03:03:15,780
All right

1507
03:03:16,579 --> 03:03:18,579
Can you fall over

1508
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:40,280
What happened there

1509
03:03:45,399 --> 03:03:52,229
The leaderboard says it all seven trying to get it just great

1510
03:03:59,649 --> 03:04:01,649
I got four more chances. Come on

1511
03:04:03,409 --> 03:04:08,370
Don't make me laugh don't make me fucking laugh

1512
03:04:21,360 --> 03:04:23,360
All right, I gotta I can't look at chat

1513
03:04:23,360 --> 03:04:28,659
Performance is reflected on the scoreboard with a low showing accordion

1514
03:05:12,739 --> 03:05:16,340
Wait for the angle i'm i'm trying to i'm I know i'm waiting

1515
03:05:18,899 --> 03:05:28,500
When it comes down

1516
03:06:03,030 --> 03:06:06,010
35 right i'll get it

1517
03:06:12,069 --> 03:06:14,069
35 is a perfect angle

1518
03:06:29,459 --> 03:06:31,459
Oh

1519
03:07:16,959 --> 03:07:18,959
It looks like he's on the phone

1520
03:07:31,989 --> 03:07:35,610
Last chance to get world record. I already got the olympic record. I gotta get the world

1521
03:07:51,270 --> 03:08:02,120
To go new olympic record

1522
03:08:08,280 --> 03:08:15,159
See it quick across the circle and then explosive as the shot went flying high into the air

1523
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:18,600
Great how much of those little shot putt balls away?

1524
03:08:19,479 --> 03:08:24,370
On final check on the standings then what an event this has been have to be really heavy

1525
03:08:26,209 --> 03:08:28,209
They're 16 pounds

1526
03:08:30,959 --> 03:08:32,879
Wow

1527
03:08:32,879 --> 03:08:34,319
That's dense

1528
03:08:34,319 --> 03:08:42,260
That's insane. There's plenty of tension in our 100 meter backstroke

1529
03:08:51,030 --> 03:08:53,930
Well, here we go this athlete's one of the favorites in this competition

1530
03:08:55,190 --> 03:08:57,190
You start in the water

1531
03:09:02,639 --> 03:09:08,639
Into the stroke now as they emerge from the water pulling hard through the water at 25 meters

1532
03:09:11,680 --> 03:09:15,040
So nearly halfway and it could be better for this athlete

1533
03:09:16,399 --> 03:09:28,229
That's a strong push as the athletes come towards the surface. It's very close at the front

1534
03:09:28,870 --> 03:09:30,469
in first place

1535
03:09:30,469 --> 03:09:32,469
come on

1536
03:09:56,819 --> 03:10:07,000
I didn't choke. It was I got to the end. I realized I was in third fourth place and I just gave up here

1537
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:15,190
We go finally we get to see me the real me

1538
03:10:30,239 --> 03:10:33,280
I was wrong will the big splash on entry have cost him dearly

1539
03:10:34,319 --> 03:10:37,920
The entry was poor. Let's take a look at the replay. He's dead

1540
03:10:38,639 --> 03:10:40,639
Good elevation nice tuck

1541
03:10:41,360 --> 03:10:43,729
But when it came to stretching out

1542
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:51,409
Big splash is the body doesn't go in quite on the straight and again that will be reflected in the scores

1543
03:10:52,610 --> 03:11:01,489
Ambitious is he gonna be with this attempt? I got it. This is backwards. Well, this is the toughest guy that he could possibly have chosen

1544
03:11:06,229 --> 03:11:08,549
Certainly can improve on that second round performance

1545
03:11:11,809 --> 03:11:16,290
I keep thinking of the accordion. It's fucking messing me up. I could just see the tiny little errors

1546
03:11:17,250 --> 03:11:22,610
No doubt there are a few nerves as the scores start to come in god damn it. All right, come on

1547
03:11:23,649 --> 03:11:28,799
Team usa needs to pick this one up. They've not been very good so far. They're back in seventh

1548
03:11:29,760 --> 03:11:35,590
Well, it's pulled out of that dive

1549
03:11:36,549 --> 03:11:38,069
Excuse me

1550
03:11:38,069 --> 03:11:41,190
There will be another opportunity needs to compose himself here

1551
03:11:47,909 --> 03:11:49,190
Well, not bad

1552
03:11:49,190 --> 03:11:50,469
I don't

1553
03:11:50,469 --> 03:11:56,440
Let's take a look at the replay a degree of difficulty and well executed

1554
03:11:57,620 --> 03:12:04,020
That was not bad. What about the judges? What's their view on seven seven seven eight eight? Yeah, that was good

1555
03:12:04,420 --> 03:12:09,059
So after that round six places what this athlete's looking at is not ideal

1556
03:12:09,059 --> 03:12:11,399
But at least it's two places above the bottom

1557
03:12:14,360 --> 03:12:23,489
This is a big moment a really really tough arcadum five community subs. What's going on arcadum? Thanks to the five subs

1558
03:12:24,129 --> 03:12:32,180
You guys don't know arcadum. I could do not know arcadum. It would be nice. That was a really fucking goddamn

1559
03:12:32,979 --> 03:12:34,979
Dungeon master i've ever seen in my life

1560
03:12:36,500 --> 03:12:40,659
Go check them out. That's the kind of performance. Thanks for the five subs dude if you're doing well

1561
03:12:41,299 --> 03:12:45,219
Is over to the judges to get their view on this

1562
03:12:45,860 --> 03:12:54,280
The dnd god himself. That's true. Let's have a look at the leaderboard and team usa are in fourth place

1563
03:12:55,159 --> 03:12:56,840
Does it get 10?

1564
03:12:56,840 --> 03:13:02,290
Wait, I got a 10. No way. Wait, can I can I get somebody clip that? I want to watch it

1565
03:13:02,530 --> 03:13:04,530
I didn't even see it. What happened?

1566
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
I got tens across the board

1567
03:13:08,979 --> 03:13:13,219
Holy shit taking those more difficult dives as this competition goes on

1568
03:13:16,579 --> 03:13:22,520
Well, this is an ambitious bold and brave choice can this athlete do it? Oh seriously, thanks arcadum

1569
03:13:23,299 --> 03:13:24,899
we're playing uh

1570
03:13:24,899 --> 03:13:27,329
We're playing olympic games

1571
03:13:27,799 --> 03:13:30,319
And I beat everything

1572
03:13:30,319 --> 03:13:32,319
I don't know what just happened, but that was fucking 10

1573
03:13:32,799 --> 03:13:36,639
That was 10 had to be this that was unbelievable. That was the best thing i've ever done

1574
03:13:36,719 --> 03:13:43,909
Of a belly flop i'm afraid to say check this shit up took the big risk and it didn't come off on this occasion

1575
03:13:44,790 --> 03:13:46,790
Not a good gamble as we look at the replay

1576
03:13:49,559 --> 03:13:51,559
Well, the judges will have their say now

1577
03:13:54,120 --> 03:13:57,079
Here's the scoreboard team usa have to adjust

1578
03:13:59,799 --> 03:14:01,799
I'm trying it's left and right on the d-pad, right?

1579
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:11,520
But just a shame the end didn't quite match the start with that dive

1580
03:14:12,399 --> 03:14:16,850
Whatever. Let's have a look how the judges rated it

1581
03:14:20,309 --> 03:14:23,350
That's fine. We didn't I who gives a shit about the three meter i'm with a 10 meter

1582
03:14:29,569 --> 03:14:33,969
He's a pc gamer. He doesn't know what his stick is. I it's I know this is the one I wanted to do

1583
03:14:37,639 --> 03:14:39,639
Here's the huge one, this is the high dive

1584
03:14:45,280 --> 03:14:47,280
Wait, how do you do this?

1585
03:14:53,760 --> 03:14:57,780
What's a frustration I think in the end a shake of the head

1586
03:14:58,739 --> 03:15:01,940
I

1587
03:15:04,340 --> 03:15:06,340
Just had like a party in college

1588
03:15:07,379 --> 03:15:09,379
Check this shit out

1589
03:15:11,270 --> 03:15:14,629
No, no, no bob. Don't do it. I'm gonna do a big one

1590
03:15:16,229 --> 03:15:20,840
I'm going off the roof

1591
03:15:20,920 --> 03:15:24,200
Get him off the fucking roof. Don't I don't want him on my fucking my roof

1592
03:15:25,159 --> 03:15:28,299
They're currently sitting last place. That was a 10 difficulty

1593
03:15:33,030 --> 03:15:36,309
Only this athlete knows i'm gonna give you a few minutes

1594
03:15:37,110 --> 03:15:39,270
It's gonna take you a long time to get over this image. I think

1595
03:15:50,149 --> 03:15:53,670
Didn't like that at all and pulled out just in time

1596
03:15:55,270 --> 03:16:02,899
I'm afraid to say that was nowhere near the best from the diver from the usa

1597
03:16:04,399 --> 03:16:06,770
God damn it

1598
03:16:07,329 --> 03:16:16,370
Not enough asian not enough strength also seem a little bit out of sync the entry into the water will cost some valuable points

1599
03:16:17,729 --> 03:16:24,049
I'm trying to down the timing of that dive a shake of the head in frustration and understandably so

1600
03:16:25,010 --> 03:16:27,010
Just do i'm hurting him

1601
03:16:27,010 --> 03:16:29,010
Didn't achieve what he set out to there

1602
03:16:29,569 --> 03:16:31,809
I'm just doing the easy one

1603
03:16:31,809 --> 03:16:34,370
Fourth dive must select a good one here

1604
03:16:35,329 --> 03:16:46,040
To cram all of that into the routine but not quite why is this guy in the olympics as he would have wanted

1605
03:16:46,840 --> 03:16:49,799
I don't know. It's like it's like the commission his son is the replay

1606
03:16:50,360 --> 03:16:52,360
This one of the more simple dives

1607
03:16:52,680 --> 03:16:56,040
And this athlete really had to execute on this

1608
03:16:57,239 --> 03:16:59,879
Let's take another look at the scoreboard. I want to try something

1609
03:17:01,159 --> 03:17:12,090
Massively difficult this dive forgettable. That was a forgettable performance

1610
03:17:12,809 --> 03:17:16,969
What was wrong with that

1611
03:17:16,969 --> 03:17:20,170
Here's the replay and this diver may want to look away now

1612
03:17:24,409 --> 03:17:28,649
That was just like dropping an action figure that will cost dearly off your tree house

1613
03:17:29,959 --> 03:17:34,760
It is the pool

1614
03:17:35,500 --> 03:17:37,659
Team usa are in last place

1615
03:17:38,459 --> 03:17:44,309
Went to the final round then to get what the hell

1616
03:17:47,670 --> 03:17:50,549
This diver is gonna have to take the biggest risk possible

1617
03:17:50,950 --> 03:17:54,120
I

1618
03:17:54,120 --> 03:17:57,219
Dive that

1619
03:17:57,219 --> 03:17:58,899
Here's the replay

1620
03:17:58,899 --> 03:18:01,940
It was an ambitious dive but just not executed at all

1621
03:18:03,610 --> 03:18:05,209
All right, that was fun

1622
03:18:05,209 --> 03:18:08,520
I'm doing the next one

1623
03:18:08,520 --> 03:18:12,280
I'm not done until we do the actual scientific hypothetical theory thing

1624
03:18:19,209 --> 03:18:21,770
Oh, this is the vault. Okay. I'm looking forward to this

1625
03:18:24,840 --> 03:18:26,620
Tuck with it. Wait

1626
03:18:26,620 --> 03:18:28,620
Oh, this is not a pole vault

1627
03:18:29,180 --> 03:18:31,180
I thought this was the pole vault

1628
03:18:36,040 --> 03:18:38,040
Press into your somersault

1629
03:18:39,450 --> 03:18:41,940
0.5 twist

1630
03:18:41,940 --> 03:18:44,329
And then hit down

1631
03:18:44,329 --> 03:18:50,860
It looks like it hurt

1632
03:18:53,260 --> 03:18:55,620
All right, we're just gonna do tuck

1633
03:19:05,020 --> 03:19:07,659
Concentration there just didn't perform the selected vault

1634
03:19:08,540 --> 03:19:14,280
Oh, that's just simply disappointing. They're not gonna be happy with that

1635
03:19:18,090 --> 03:19:21,370
Oh, so let's indulge and have another look at this. Here's the replay

1636
03:19:25,139 --> 03:19:28,180
Why did gravity turn up times five when I got halfway there

1637
03:19:29,059 --> 03:19:31,059
So here come the judges scores

1638
03:19:31,940 --> 03:19:35,620
Quick look at the scores at the end of that round and as you'll see

1639
03:19:35,780 --> 03:19:41,139
Do I have a backpack with magnets on me and there's a negatively charged ion plate underneath me

1640
03:19:42,500 --> 03:19:44,500
Straight i'll get this one be hard

1641
03:19:44,659 --> 03:19:52,260
Well, this is really interesting stuff now a medium difficulty selection could really turn out to be a good choice for this gymnast

1642
03:19:57,239 --> 03:19:59,239
Yep, i'm okay

1643
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,799
You don't die that just made it a taffy i'm gonna be fine

1644
03:20:06,629 --> 03:20:09,510
Well, let's have a quick look at the highlights of that performance then

1645
03:20:12,739 --> 03:20:19,979
Well in come the scores now, but I honestly can't see this gymnast getting high points for that vault

1646
03:20:20,379 --> 03:20:24,299
All right. What am I doing wrong here? I'm trying to stick it with with the uh left on the analog

1647
03:20:25,340 --> 03:20:27,260
That's too late

1648
03:20:27,260 --> 03:20:41,290
I want to do that one again. This is eason dawney. Welcome to the final of the men's single scores

1649
03:20:42,250 --> 03:20:44,469
What is skulls?

1650
03:20:44,469 --> 03:20:47,750
Wait, wait, it's a it's a rowboat competition

1651
03:20:48,469 --> 03:20:53,209
Let's take a look at the line up

1652
03:20:54,139 --> 03:20:56,569
tutorial

1653
03:21:03,319 --> 03:21:05,399
Press and hold the triggers to begin rowing

1654
03:21:06,950 --> 03:21:09,350
Release l2 to return the oars and do it again

1655
03:21:21,180 --> 03:21:29,430
double tap to boost

1656
03:21:29,510 --> 03:21:44,250
Hey, i'm going to show you everybody at the gym that uses this fucking thing. It's the only specters cross the finish line backwards

1657
03:21:51,479 --> 03:21:53,479
And like you want to correct them

1658
03:21:53,479 --> 03:21:55,479
But like when you see somebody at the gym going like this

1659
03:21:57,270 --> 03:22:00,389
It's like, oh no, he's just kind of gonna keep he's gonna do his thing

1660
03:22:01,190 --> 03:22:04,760
Okay

1661
03:22:04,760 --> 03:22:13,270
I'm gonna go all the way

1662
03:22:21,909 --> 03:22:23,909
Saves gum

1663
03:22:28,709 --> 03:22:34,469
Why am I getting destroyed

1664
03:22:38,659 --> 03:22:40,659
Why is there so many people on bikes over there

1665
03:22:42,020 --> 03:22:44,020
Are there two events going on at the same time?

1666
03:23:14,139 --> 03:23:18,000
Just losing to the bikes i'm i'm not racing the bikes

1667
03:23:25,799 --> 03:23:31,799
Sites and situated not far away from winza castle. This is one of the more pit to rest venues

1668
03:23:33,989 --> 03:23:36,340
Go

1669
03:23:36,340 --> 03:23:39,059
All six rowers pull away from the blocks then here

1670
03:23:44,389 --> 03:23:48,709
Well, this has been a decent performance so far but needs to up the stroke rate here

1671
03:23:50,450 --> 03:23:53,010
breathless day

1672
03:23:53,110 --> 03:23:55,110
Terrific conditions to rowing

1673
03:23:55,510 --> 03:24:04,729
Britain the front runner. This is an impressive performance

1674
03:24:05,610 --> 03:24:11,930
Good pace this from china have a real chance of winning belgium are doing well here in third place

1675
03:24:12,809 --> 03:24:16,010
Just to piss off the pace team usa they're back in sixth

1676
03:24:16,969 --> 03:24:30,620
Through 500 meters. That's the halfway point

1677
03:24:34,040 --> 03:24:36,040
Go faster. I can't

1678
03:24:51,760 --> 03:24:59,100
What's wrong with me what's wrong with my guy what's why is he quitting what's wrong with my guys

1679
03:25:16,569 --> 03:25:21,049
All right, if there were 10 people on this i'm the one guy pretending to row and not doing any work

1680
03:25:42,280 --> 03:26:00,000
Hurts my arms and i'm not even doing it just pulling in leaning back to chill him

1681
03:26:00,159 --> 03:26:08,780
See again not a particularly good performance

1682
03:26:08,940 --> 03:26:13,549
Right early on was down and then when he needed to pull through it didn't quite happen

1683
03:26:13,950 --> 03:26:17,790
The middle section just letting him down and then coming down the home straight

1684
03:26:18,190 --> 03:26:20,670
We're really expecting more from this athlete

1685
03:26:20,670 --> 03:26:25,149
But on this occasion, he just couldn't quite put in the performance we were hoping for

1686
03:26:26,270 --> 03:26:27,950
All right, I want to do some stuff

1687
03:26:27,950 --> 03:26:36,840
I want to do some things

1688
03:26:36,840 --> 03:26:40,299
All right, each folly ball weight lifting

1689
03:26:43,530 --> 03:26:47,290
Karen what did I did that right kayak single of karen? Wasn't that the

1690
03:26:48,489 --> 03:26:55,639
Isn't karen the same thing?

1691
03:26:55,639 --> 03:27:06,700
Did I do both?

1692
03:27:06,700 --> 03:27:09,579
All right. I want to do

1693
03:27:09,579 --> 03:27:13,739
What's the last thing? I don't think I really yeah, let's just do these I want to do I want my theory to play out

1694
03:27:15,629 --> 03:27:17,629
Oh karen's the bike, right? Okay

1695
03:27:20,040 --> 03:27:31,959
I want to say something

1696
03:27:31,959 --> 03:27:33,959
You wanted to do the vault again?

1697
03:27:34,760 --> 03:27:36,760
All right, i'll do that before I go

1698
03:27:37,360 --> 03:27:39,360
my too late flop

1699
03:27:42,799 --> 03:27:44,159
No

1700
03:27:44,159 --> 03:27:49,819
Oh, I would do 3d mode, too. Yeah, there's still more to do. Hold on. All right, here we go men's 100 meter

1701
03:27:55,319 --> 03:27:57,469
Here we go

1702
03:27:57,469 --> 03:28:18,540
They must get off the blocks quickly ready. Oh, it doesn't automatically it doesn't I can't do it. I wish I could

1703
03:28:19,020 --> 03:28:28,250
Injury

1704
03:28:28,250 --> 03:28:31,610
Seemed to struggle with this one from the start. I don't know what was wrong

1705
03:28:31,690 --> 03:28:37,610
But maybe there was an injury or something else just didn't look as smooth and the result very much reflects that

1706
03:28:44,750 --> 03:28:46,750
And it's gold for jamaica

1707
03:28:46,989 --> 03:28:48,510
Okay

1708
03:28:48,510 --> 03:28:50,190
Let's check out the other one

1709
03:28:50,190 --> 03:28:52,430
Because I didn't do this one coming up. Yeah, I didn't do volleyball

1710
03:28:57,850 --> 03:29:01,770
I feel like I want to put in the beijing one and play the other events that aren't in this game

1711
03:29:03,690 --> 03:29:05,690
We're gonna do that i'm putting in beijing one

1712
03:29:06,329 --> 03:29:11,690
With the sam that's arrived for the 2012 games. There's other events. I think on this game that aren't out here

1713
03:29:12,569 --> 03:29:14,569
I'm gonna i'm gonna just play them

1714
03:29:17,309 --> 03:29:19,950
All right, serve bar, but this is an actual game of volleyball

1715
03:29:20,750 --> 03:29:37,049
Okay, then press x press x before the target begins flashing

1716
03:29:40,059 --> 03:29:42,059
Use l hold l

1717
03:29:53,690 --> 03:29:55,690
I get it. I know how to play volleyball

1718
03:30:01,450 --> 03:30:15,600
All right, let's go i'm putting in beijing wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no I want to do

1719
03:30:16,479 --> 03:30:19,659
Stop putting in beijing

1720
03:30:20,139 --> 03:30:25,579
I'm gonna take a piss and go i'm putting beijing. Oh, yeah, 3d mode. Yeah, right, right, right, right

1721
03:30:26,219 --> 03:30:42,250
It's probably gonna fuck up the tv. Is this gonna fuck up the tv? How is this 3d?

1722
03:30:44,110 --> 03:30:54,780
You just see it twice

1723
03:30:54,780 --> 03:30:58,750
You have to cross your eyes

1724
03:30:58,750 --> 03:31:00,989
Oh, you need the glasses. Okay, but hold on a minute

1725
03:31:01,709 --> 03:31:03,870
What the hell would 3d glasses do for this?

1726
03:31:08,940 --> 03:31:12,270
But what would it do?

1727
03:31:12,270 --> 03:31:14,270
Do I need my individual eyes?

1728
03:31:14,909 --> 03:31:18,170
You need to type be a 3d monitor

1729
03:31:21,500 --> 03:31:29,120
Oh, okay. All right beer back. I'm gonna put in beijing and i'm gonna go uh, take a quick break up beer back

1730
03:31:29,600 --> 03:35:22,520
Okay. Hi, um, why is this taking so long to make a save profile?

1731
03:35:26,639 --> 03:35:28,639
Saving please do not switch the power off

1732
03:35:28,799 --> 03:35:30,799
Didn't just take one second

1733
03:35:33,020 --> 03:35:35,579
Why is it saving 10 gigs of space I don't understand

1734
03:35:39,899 --> 03:35:48,200
Why is it taking so long

1735
03:35:50,360 --> 03:35:53,639
What do you want us to tell you make me I don't know make me feel better say I don't know

1736
03:35:53,639 --> 03:35:56,010
Do your ps3 is just working hard

1737
03:36:03,920 --> 03:36:10,510
I can hear it. Can you guys hear the weird little like switch it off switch it off switch it off. What do you mean?

1738
03:36:11,149 --> 03:36:13,049
It's fine

1739
03:36:13,049 --> 03:36:15,049
It's just a old ps3

1740
03:36:20,219 --> 03:36:22,780
Yeah, so this is 2008. So if we're probably gonna

1741
03:36:23,500 --> 03:36:26,219
Lose some physics and some graphics on the way back

1742
03:36:36,030 --> 03:36:38,670
The worrying of the hard drive. Yeah, okay. I think we're good. I'll be

1743
03:36:42,059 --> 03:36:44,059
Sega I think we're good

1744
03:36:46,989 --> 03:36:53,180
I probably need to change the title, huh powered by games by that's very old

1745
03:36:56,159 --> 03:36:58,159
2008

1746
03:37:01,760 --> 03:37:03,760
The official olympic games

1747
03:37:05,069 --> 03:37:09,719
2008 already looks a little crusty

1748
03:37:12,649 --> 03:37:21,290
Can you already do this?

1749
03:37:21,290 --> 03:37:23,290
Some games no, I don't care

1750
03:37:24,700 --> 03:37:26,379
All right competition

1751
03:37:26,379 --> 03:37:31,790
Some features of competition only available sign. I don't care

1752
03:37:33,600 --> 03:37:35,600
Play on this system

1753
03:37:40,110 --> 03:37:45,399
track, okay

1754
03:37:45,399 --> 03:37:48,200
Field. Yeah. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a minute. There's

1755
03:37:48,920 --> 03:37:50,280
hammer throw

1756
03:37:50,280 --> 03:37:54,319
Let's do 100 100 meter

1757
03:37:57,209 --> 03:38:01,239
Hammer throw

1758
03:38:01,239 --> 03:38:03,239
This does look like a racing game. You're right. It does

1759
03:38:05,610 --> 03:38:06,969
diving

1760
03:38:06,969 --> 03:38:11,559
Let's do diving

1761
03:38:11,559 --> 03:38:12,889
uh

1762
03:38:12,889 --> 03:38:17,770
Parallel bars rings floor exercise beam uneven bars. Yeah

1763
03:38:20,409 --> 03:38:22,409
shotgun air pistol

1764
03:38:23,100 --> 03:38:25,100
We did these let's do air pistol

1765
03:38:26,829 --> 03:38:29,840
archery weight lifting

1766
03:38:29,840 --> 03:38:32,270
judo

1767
03:38:35,930 --> 03:38:37,930
Combined events to cap one

1768
03:38:38,329 --> 03:38:40,989
Okay

1769
03:38:40,989 --> 03:38:42,750
I'm ready. Let's do it

1770
03:38:42,750 --> 03:39:00,989
I'm looking forward to judo

1771
03:39:00,989 --> 03:39:03,309
Hey, i'm back from the playstation stream. It sucked

1772
03:39:03,870 --> 03:39:08,379
Wait, like an official ps playstation stream is well, what are they doing? What are they talking about?

1773
03:39:10,090 --> 03:39:17,790
Anything interesting?

1774
03:39:17,790 --> 03:39:19,790
This feels like an old sega game

1775
03:39:20,200 --> 03:39:22,920
I hold l2 and r2 to build power

1776
03:39:25,180 --> 03:39:28,219
Once the power bar hits the red zone, you'll launch from the blocks

1777
03:39:31,920 --> 03:39:36,559
Press x and o alternately or toggle l and r to build up speed

1778
03:39:37,280 --> 03:39:40,920
This is way more complicated than 2012

1779
03:39:41,719 --> 03:39:44,479
Press r2 to showboat

1780
03:39:44,639 --> 03:39:51,209
All right, let's go

1781
03:39:51,209 --> 03:39:57,549
Where am I?

1782
03:39:57,549 --> 03:39:59,549
Just showboat the whole time

1783
03:39:59,549 --> 03:40:13,100
Well, that's me

1784
03:40:13,100 --> 03:40:21,420
All right, hold l2 and r2

1785
03:40:24,329 --> 03:40:28,540
Okay, here we go

1786
03:40:28,540 --> 03:41:00,569
What who the fuck is that guy? What's that guy doing? Is there a waiter here? Oh, no, that's official. Okay

1787
03:41:07,840 --> 03:41:13,930
All right, I lost that one's way more complicated than the first than the I said first game

1788
03:41:13,930 --> 03:41:20,969
But it's the second game first game of the night. I can't wait to do hammer throw

1789
03:41:21,770 --> 03:41:25,049
If I knew that hammer throw was an olympic sport, I probably would have tried to do it

1790
03:41:25,530 --> 03:41:27,930
That sounds like fun. Just whipping a hammer as hard as you can

1791
03:41:30,829 --> 03:41:32,829
I get why people do this shit. That's fun

1792
03:41:38,030 --> 03:41:52,670
Throw a hammer as hard as you can you got it. Oh, it's this

1793
03:41:56,280 --> 03:42:04,170
It's the back the fuck away from me or I cannot control if you die or not event

1794
03:42:05,639 --> 03:42:07,639
Holy shit, this is gonna be impossible

1795
03:42:11,200 --> 03:42:13,200
I don't hold on. I can we do that again?

1796
03:42:13,680 --> 03:42:23,129
Okay, so you start spinning

1797
03:42:24,520 --> 03:42:26,120
rotate l

1798
03:42:26,120 --> 03:42:28,120
To match the marker

1799
03:42:30,110 --> 03:42:32,590
Press l2 or r2 to release the hammer

1800
03:42:33,389 --> 03:42:56,889
What direction should I throw the damn thing? He's gonna wreck somebody in the crowd

1801
03:42:57,610 --> 03:43:02,840
Now that's what the fence is for

1802
03:43:02,840 --> 03:43:06,920
The long shot is a very long close-up of this guy's face

1803
03:43:11,899 --> 03:43:14,059
I mean, is it skip or is it continue?

1804
03:43:14,620 --> 03:43:21,319
What'd you say?

1805
03:43:21,319 --> 03:43:30,440
I skip it

1806
03:43:30,440 --> 03:43:43,979
No, do not skip you're skipping don't skip. No skip. Don't skip. Yes

1807
03:43:47,530 --> 03:43:48,969
All right, let's go

1808
03:43:48,969 --> 03:43:53,069
Okay, just gonna match the

1809
03:43:54,379 --> 03:44:08,569
Match it with the meter surrounding him. Wait, i'm not the ball. I thought I was the ball

1810
03:44:08,649 --> 03:44:11,690
I thought I was the ball. I didn't I thought the ball was my movement and not

1811
03:44:12,649 --> 03:44:19,500
Okay, I get it

1812
03:44:19,500 --> 03:44:44,040
Why wouldn't I be him turning and not what i'm i'm the meter turning? Come on. Okay, i'll get it this time

1813
03:44:45,000 --> 03:45:15,790
Pick up not bad. That's all right

1814
03:45:17,790 --> 03:45:23,479
He's just not producing his best today

1815
03:45:24,120 --> 03:45:28,040
Yeah, you can see as he walks off. He knows he needs to do better than that

1816
03:45:28,600 --> 03:45:31,879
Bit of a lackluster effort there needs to improve on that

1817
03:45:32,520 --> 03:45:39,000
Yeah, but in this event all it takes is that one big throw two ai's talking to each other. That's what it sounds like

1818
03:45:49,920 --> 03:45:52,479
Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. Well, i'm you know what I mean though

1819
03:46:13,100 --> 03:46:15,819
Oh foul you didn't take that long to tell me it was a foul

1820
03:46:16,620 --> 03:46:39,440
You could have done it immediately. That's pretty good

1821
03:46:55,819 --> 03:47:06,670
Damn it. I can do it again. I can be better with the ball. That's hard to do. I'll get it

1822
03:47:18,409 --> 03:47:20,409
That's gonna be a fucking world record right there

1823
03:47:20,569 --> 03:47:28,719
Right measure that shit. That's above the world record

1824
03:47:30,620 --> 03:47:36,719
Yep

1825
03:47:36,719 --> 03:47:51,959
Did it that's he's doing the hulk hogan. That's what I would do. That's a great celebration

1826
03:47:59,520 --> 03:48:01,520
three fouls and world record

1827
03:48:03,100 --> 03:48:12,379
All it takes is one man

1828
03:48:27,180 --> 03:48:32,090
Nice all right. Let's hear it. It's time for the music

1829
03:48:32,729 --> 03:48:59,629
Please stand for the national anthem of the united states of america. I'll be right

1830
03:49:05,500 --> 03:49:07,500
I don't think you can get dmca'd

1831
03:49:08,059 --> 03:49:21,049
With the national anthem

1832
03:49:21,129 --> 03:49:24,840
You're gonna get sued

1833
03:49:25,479 --> 03:49:29,879
What was next there was a lot of shit on this list i'm looking forward some of them were crazy

1834
03:49:37,020 --> 03:49:39,840
Disney owns it. I think the day that happens

1835
03:49:40,399 --> 03:49:42,000
That's the turning point

1836
03:49:42,000 --> 03:49:45,540
But for society just to collapse like absolutely collapse

1837
03:49:52,270 --> 03:49:58,989
Like if disney copyrights the national anthem you're gonna be eating your food out of an old can that's in your basement like there's no way

1838
03:49:59,870 --> 03:50:05,870
Oh, here we go. This is a big one

1839
03:50:18,200 --> 03:50:23,079
Anybody understand this rotate l to match the green marker and r to match the red marker

1840
03:50:24,239 --> 03:50:33,389
Oh, I don't think you're gonna pick my dive

1841
03:50:34,030 --> 03:51:06,170
Oh, here we go

1842
03:51:06,170 --> 03:51:13,979
Wait, where are the balls? Oh, I get it. Okay. I get it. You have to

1843
03:51:14,909 --> 03:51:21,309
I thought I was the balls again

1844
03:51:21,309 --> 03:51:23,309
This is fucking horrible

1845
03:51:38,809 --> 03:51:50,329
I get it

1846
03:51:50,329 --> 03:52:07,049
Yeah, that's hard to do. It's like scratching your belly and patting your head at the same time. Why is it off to be in slow motion?

1847
03:52:34,889 --> 03:52:36,889
That was pretty damn good

1848
03:52:38,479 --> 03:52:40,479
That would have been at least eight or nine

1849
03:52:41,360 --> 03:52:47,770
This was when I was flashy as the other one. Let's see what happens if you just completely fuck the whole thing up

1850
03:52:48,569 --> 03:53:03,870
I'm gonna try to not get any points

1851
03:53:03,870 --> 03:53:20,569
What's with the harry potter whispering thing?

1852
03:53:24,319 --> 03:53:27,760
Actively pretending. Yeah, I I guess you just do the move but

1853
03:53:28,559 --> 03:53:30,989
depending on how long they were in the

1854
03:53:34,719 --> 03:53:39,200
I better get a zero, right?

1855
03:53:40,879 --> 03:53:45,180
Okay

1856
03:53:45,180 --> 03:53:50,379
Uh, I don't want I don't do that again. How do I speed time up?

1857
03:54:03,979 --> 03:54:12,040
This game is way worse. Yeah, it is way worse. Well, we haven't gotten to judo yet. So hold on hold that thought

1858
03:54:32,190 --> 03:54:34,409
All right, that's it, right?

1859
03:54:34,409 --> 03:54:55,209
That's it. You have to dive 10 times

1860
03:54:56,879 --> 03:54:58,190
What?

1861
03:54:58,190 --> 03:54:59,549
No, I don't

1862
03:54:59,549 --> 03:55:14,270
I don't know how you make the high dive not fun in a video game

1863
03:55:14,989 --> 03:55:28,319
Is that even possible?

1864
03:55:28,319 --> 03:55:37,799
All right. Cool. Good saw waiting room. I don't even know what that disc is. It might even be gone

1865
03:55:38,200 --> 03:55:41,469
I have no idea where the saw disc is

1866
03:55:47,450 --> 03:55:49,450
You

1867
03:55:50,409 --> 03:55:53,530
This is giving me so much anxiety, holy shit boy why

1868
03:55:59,389 --> 03:56:04,510
To skip to saw 2 I have to buy saw 2 I don't own it i'm gonna play it though

1869
03:56:05,930 --> 03:56:08,649
Here we go. Now it's time to fucking plug

1870
03:56:18,459 --> 03:56:21,180
Parallel bars i'm gonna do all kinds of crazy shit up here

1871
03:56:21,819 --> 03:56:27,659
There's l2 and r2 to until vertical to achieve a good lift

1872
03:56:28,459 --> 03:56:32,649
So you go bang bang bang bang bang bang bang, okay, then how do you trick

1873
03:56:33,450 --> 03:56:38,600
The l and r left or right to position the arrows beneath the hands

1874
03:56:39,479 --> 03:56:44,489
Okay

1875
03:56:44,489 --> 03:56:47,770
Press the displayed buttons in order for the perfect dismount

1876
03:56:48,489 --> 03:56:51,930
Okay, let's go

1877
03:56:51,930 --> 03:57:10,379
Sounds like wario. We're gonna jump up or no. How do you approach this?

1878
03:57:11,020 --> 03:57:26,040
Oh like that good. Here we go

1879
03:57:30,639 --> 03:57:39,559
I'm doing that. I guess

1880
03:57:39,559 --> 03:57:49,629
Pretty good. Wait, what's this?

1881
03:57:49,629 --> 03:57:54,350
This is just like lining up mini game line thing just not even doing anything

1882
03:57:54,350 --> 03:58:09,899
It's just placed weird circle underneath where he is. I'll tell you if you ever have it wait

1883
03:58:19,100 --> 03:58:31,840
Games quiet. Oh shit lost

1884
03:58:34,110 --> 03:58:40,110
Game sucks. The london one's better. I know I know but I we gotta see the events that I didn't play in london

1885
03:58:40,670 --> 03:58:52,719
Turn it back down. That was one guy. Okay, play the 2016 one

1886
03:58:53,200 --> 03:58:58,940
What is it for is it a ps4 and xbox one?

1887
03:59:06,680 --> 03:59:10,760
I was under the impression that after 2012 the games would really just awful

1888
03:59:12,280 --> 03:59:16,040
Keep the fucking arrows. I'm not I want to keep the arrows. How do I skip this?

1889
03:59:16,920 --> 03:59:45,129
These little mini games. I'm not even controlling anybody just fall off just fall off

1890
03:59:46,959 --> 03:59:50,219
Don't hold it. Just fall down

1891
03:59:50,219 --> 03:59:52,510
fall down

1892
03:59:52,510 --> 04:00:04,270
Fall it's just gonna play the animation. No matter what it's just based on how many that's sad

1893
04:00:05,149 --> 04:00:06,270
Dad

1894
04:00:06,270 --> 04:00:16,379
Yeah, this 2012 was way better

1895
04:00:16,860 --> 04:00:25,680
Thank god we're out of that. I need to get to judo first and there's a shooting one

1896
04:00:26,239 --> 04:00:34,319
Huge disc is throw but throw the disc in real life

1897
04:00:39,260 --> 04:00:48,459
I wonder how far I could throw a disc frisbee style. What do you think? I could probably get it

1898
04:00:51,450 --> 04:00:53,450
It doesn't weigh that much. I'm gonna say

1899
04:00:55,200 --> 04:01:04,239
25 feet 30 feet. Is that really under shooting it there 40 feet? I could do more than 40 feet

1900
04:01:04,559 --> 04:01:13,200
I could probably get please don't have please let me walk around. Please please let me walk around

1901
04:01:13,920 --> 04:01:17,239
Please not have it be a mini game. Let me walk around and do moves, please

1902
04:01:27,899 --> 04:01:38,479
That's it. That's it. I can't walk around with the analog and jump and stuff. Come on

1903
04:01:41,629 --> 04:01:44,739
None of this matters i'm gonna hit i'm just gonna hit every button randomly

1904
04:01:57,530 --> 04:02:00,600
David cage game

1905
04:02:01,000 --> 04:02:05,159
The only difference is there's a story there

1906
04:02:05,639 --> 04:02:14,280
No story here. Look at me

1907
04:02:19,360 --> 04:02:22,159
What do you think my floor exercise would be

1908
04:02:22,959 --> 04:02:26,700
Dude, what if I did like a germa olympics?

1909
04:02:27,180 --> 04:02:34,510
Has this got a bunch of like my drunk friends to come and do like random things

1910
04:02:35,309 --> 04:02:37,309
The floor exercises and stuff

1911
04:02:40,860 --> 04:02:46,540
And then you guys would have to vote on who wins. I kind of like this idea

1912
04:02:52,840 --> 04:02:54,780
I need that

1913
04:02:54,780 --> 04:02:56,780
I wonder how the other one would actually take

1914
04:03:03,739 --> 04:03:07,739
Last time you did a floor exercise you left for two months. Well, I wouldn't participate in that

1915
04:03:07,899 --> 04:03:10,350
Six

1916
04:03:10,350 --> 04:03:15,389
I could do a floor exercise. I don't have to move around that much. I can just fucking pantomime and move my hands and

1917
04:03:16,750 --> 04:03:18,750
Like magic tricks and stuff

1918
04:03:19,069 --> 04:03:28,959
That's awful. This game is awful

1919
04:03:28,959 --> 04:03:35,239
It's truly awful

1920
04:03:35,239 --> 04:03:37,559
One of these has to pop out and make us

1921
04:03:38,840 --> 04:03:52,969
Happy, right? One of something's got to pop out here to do mario and sonic. There is a new one, isn't there?

1922
04:03:57,370 --> 04:04:00,809
No, I don't even want to do I know what it's gonna be. I already know what it's gonna be

1923
04:04:00,969 --> 04:04:02,809
I don't want to even see it

1924
04:04:02,809 --> 04:04:07,120
I already know what's gonna happen. It's gonna be just stand still. Why just press x once

1925
04:04:07,920 --> 04:04:24,639
That doesn't matter. It's tony hawke grinding

1926
04:04:31,280 --> 04:04:35,690
You can actually fall

1927
04:04:35,690 --> 04:04:37,690
By the way, I always saw this

1928
04:04:37,930 --> 04:04:40,569
As the most difficult thing that a human being could do

1929
04:04:42,510 --> 04:04:44,670
In any doesn't matter what no matter what it is

1930
04:04:45,819 --> 04:04:48,540
This he doing a backflip and landing on this

1931
04:04:49,260 --> 04:04:53,340
And not shattering every bone in your body is insane that you can do a backflip and land on here

1932
04:04:54,590 --> 04:04:56,989
Do like a backflip and spin four times in the air

1933
04:04:57,709 --> 04:05:00,200
It's a cartoon. It's not even possible

1934
04:05:01,239 --> 04:05:17,200
I named something harder than this. What what is harder than this doing surgery on somebody?

1935
04:05:19,819 --> 04:05:23,790
uh

1936
04:05:23,790 --> 04:05:24,829
I mean that's that's hard

1937
04:05:24,829 --> 04:05:30,190
But is it hard is it as hard as doing a backflip on a one inch beam and staying up and like doing all kinds of like

1938
04:05:30,190 --> 04:05:32,190
Look at me using all that

1939
04:05:33,930 --> 04:05:43,790
Shattering your bones. Do you know what they're made out of?

1940
04:05:45,209 --> 04:05:46,649
wood

1941
04:05:46,649 --> 04:05:50,729
This is like a block of hard like foam wood shit. I don't even know what that I don't know what it is

1942
04:05:57,629 --> 04:06:01,069
No, that wooden bones the actual banister thing what is it made out of?

1943
04:06:15,709 --> 04:06:18,190
Guys if your hand if your body was made out of wood

1944
04:06:19,440 --> 04:06:22,879
Opening and closing your car door would just hurt you every day

1945
04:06:27,950 --> 04:06:29,950
Walking up the stairs would be hell

1946
04:06:30,829 --> 04:06:33,149
Oh my god, I thought this is gonna be so much fun

1947
04:06:33,790 --> 04:06:38,510
I thought it was gonna be so fun with all these different gymnastics events and they got rid of them in 2012 because they realized that

1948
04:06:38,510 --> 04:06:40,510
They couldn't figure out a way to make it fun

1949
04:06:42,139 --> 04:06:58,590
That's why none of them are here

1950
04:06:58,670 --> 04:07:00,670
They could they just didn't that's true

1951
04:07:02,090 --> 04:07:05,549
Thank god. It was quick judo better not be like this

1952
04:07:05,549 --> 04:07:08,989
I better be able to hit circle to punch and x to kick or i'm gonna be really mad

1953
04:07:15,469 --> 04:07:17,709
If judo is a rhythm game, i'm gonna pull the disc out

1954
04:07:21,340 --> 04:07:26,219
You heard it if judo is a rhythm game. I'm i'm pressing the release disc button

1955
04:07:26,780 --> 04:07:52,090
I'm gonna snap the disc. It's dangerous. I don't do dangerous things on stream anymore. You don't kick in judo

1956
04:07:55,979 --> 04:07:59,819
Here we are finally now we can actually get some goddamn action

1957
04:08:00,620 --> 04:08:10,559
I didn't do the tutorial

1958
04:08:10,559 --> 04:08:19,020
You just shoot why am I setting up a math problem?

1959
04:08:28,920 --> 04:08:30,680
What's the point of the first one?

1960
04:08:30,680 --> 04:08:35,600
What's the point of of using graph paper?

1961
04:08:36,319 --> 04:08:48,799
It's pulling me down

1962
04:08:48,799 --> 04:09:04,479
It's the hand getting tired

1963
04:09:04,479 --> 04:09:11,319
Why can I not set that every time?

1964
04:09:13,239 --> 04:09:15,239
They by the way, do they shoot bullets?

1965
04:09:15,959 --> 04:09:20,989
Or is this like pellets or something? By the way, what's going on here?

1966
04:09:21,629 --> 04:09:31,760
It's just hold on six. Okay. I was I thought I was gonna keep shooting the same spot where eight was

1967
04:09:32,479 --> 04:09:45,600
Yeah, what is going on with these glasses?

1968
04:09:49,149 --> 04:09:52,680
What are those? Is one of them a magnifier and the other one?

1969
04:09:53,319 --> 04:09:56,520
Is this a jeweler? Is he working on diamonds? I don't know. What is this for?

1970
04:10:00,159 --> 04:10:02,159
Looks like a warcraft gnome

1971
04:10:06,350 --> 04:10:08,750
This is crazy. Well, i'm i'm what is it for?

1972
04:10:09,309 --> 04:10:15,020
I kind of want to try these on

1973
04:10:15,020 --> 04:10:22,379
Just close one eye and just look through kind of the magnified one

1974
04:10:23,100 --> 04:10:25,530
I think I would like these in real life

1975
04:10:25,850 --> 04:10:29,120
If I was able to switch those down

1976
04:10:42,430 --> 04:10:58,479
Plus two perception. Yeah, that'd be awesome. I'm not even trying i'm just kind of hitting things

1977
04:11:05,690 --> 04:11:09,600
Grandma, look at me. Hey, look at you

1978
04:11:13,979 --> 04:11:15,979
I'm not trying but at least I get to play

1979
04:11:19,399 --> 04:11:22,520
10.7 is not just 10.0. There's higher than 10

1980
04:11:33,319 --> 04:11:41,639
Get extra in the middle

1981
04:11:41,639 --> 04:11:43,639
You can get in the middle of the middle

1982
04:11:51,870 --> 04:11:54,219
Yeah, I guess I lost

1983
04:11:54,219 --> 04:11:56,590
didn't even place

1984
04:11:56,590 --> 04:11:58,590
archery, okay

1985
04:12:00,030 --> 04:12:02,030
This one should be fun

1986
04:12:02,110 --> 04:12:07,229
I thought the controller was on her head. I thought it was like what's with all these weird apparatus?

1987
04:12:07,389 --> 04:12:09,389
I thought that was something on her head

1988
04:12:09,629 --> 04:12:17,020
Okay, wait

1989
04:12:17,020 --> 04:12:32,920
Whatever let's go seven. Oh

1990
04:12:34,520 --> 04:12:44,299
You think they're ever gonna make a game that uses the huntsman style bow and arrow mechanics in an actual video game

1991
04:12:45,559 --> 04:12:49,920
I want it so bad

1992
04:12:50,559 --> 04:12:59,450
TF2 has that yeah, it's been like 12 years

1993
04:13:02,040 --> 04:13:04,440
I'm not talking. Hey, i'm i'm not saying

1994
04:13:05,079 --> 04:13:10,350
Hey, give me a game. That was give me a game eight years ago. That came up with this. I want one now

1995
04:13:11,149 --> 04:13:13,639
And I want it to be like a single player game

1996
04:13:13,639 --> 04:13:17,079
I don't want to be online because people are way better than me online and they'll just shoot me the barn

1997
04:13:17,079 --> 04:13:20,920
I run the head first before I can shoot them. So I want to do it at my own pace with my own single player time

1998
04:13:22,680 --> 04:13:25,799
No, not in minecraft. I'm talking where the whole game is based around like awesome

1999
04:13:26,360 --> 04:13:28,200
perfect incredible

2000
04:13:28,200 --> 04:13:31,280
archery mechanics six

2001
04:13:31,280 --> 04:13:36,000
Just bow and arrow just perfect like they spend three years perfect making it perfect

2002
04:13:43,319 --> 04:13:46,909
seven horizon

2003
04:13:46,909 --> 04:13:51,469
No, it's not no, it's gotta be first person. It's gotta be first person

2004
04:13:52,110 --> 04:14:03,610
I thought it was actually gonna hit still just make it yourself

2005
04:14:05,629 --> 04:14:07,950
I don't I don't know shit about making video games

2006
04:14:15,850 --> 04:14:17,850
forehead

2007
04:14:22,909 --> 04:14:24,909
Crisis three, is it good?

2008
04:14:33,360 --> 04:14:39,040
Crisis is a weird game. I feel like i've never played crisis before but I know i've played it but it sits in this weird place

2009
04:14:39,040 --> 04:14:42,239
In my memory where I may as well have never even opened it once

2010
04:14:42,879 --> 04:14:53,159
I don't remember anything to me crisis and far cry

2011
04:14:53,719 --> 04:14:56,040
Just blend together into the same video game in my head

2012
04:15:01,899 --> 04:15:13,500
Ten and they're very different. Yeah, I I don't know why it's just that's the case

2013
04:15:14,299 --> 04:15:18,590
You know what? I think it probably is nine

2014
04:15:20,110 --> 04:15:24,750
There's like seven bar cries and like four crises. It's like they they just feel like they're all

2015
04:15:25,229 --> 04:15:27,229
There's a lot of them

2016
04:15:27,229 --> 04:15:32,920
How many crises are there?

2017
04:15:33,000 --> 04:15:37,469
Nine three four, right?

2018
04:15:46,319 --> 04:15:54,110
It's 2020 bro. Every day. There's a new one. Is that guy wearing flowers as a watch?

2019
04:15:54,190 --> 04:16:09,280
I skipped it way too quickly. It looked like it it come our judo. Here comes the judo dream

2020
04:16:10,079 --> 04:16:14,110
No, it's weightlifting

2021
04:16:14,110 --> 04:16:15,149
rotate

2022
04:16:15,149 --> 04:16:17,469
Eleanor opposite directions to increase power

2023
04:16:22,120 --> 04:16:25,479
Slowly rotate eleanor outwards from the bottom. This sucks

2024
04:16:39,239 --> 04:17:18,059
472 pounds

2025
04:17:18,059 --> 04:17:25,819
I can't even all right. It's you rotate different directions. That's so hard to do with i'm gonna do it. I'm gonna try two hands

2026
04:17:26,989 --> 04:17:29,790
My fingers bump into each other because it's a fucking playstation

2027
04:17:30,750 --> 04:17:37,659
Why would you make why would you do that?

2028
04:17:38,489 --> 04:17:44,250
If you put both your thumbs on the analogs and you rotate opposite directions your thumbs hit each other in the middle

2029
04:17:46,719 --> 04:17:48,879
That's the most bogus fucking thing in the world

2030
04:17:57,159 --> 04:17:59,159
Pick up a playstation 3 controller right now

2031
04:17:59,780 --> 04:18:05,239
Rotate it in opposite directions and come in and meet in the middle and you tell me that your thumbs don't touch

2032
04:18:05,719 --> 04:18:07,719
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope

2033
04:18:15,840 --> 04:18:17,840
Your fat thumbs I don't

2034
04:18:18,000 --> 04:18:45,239
I'm having a look

2035
04:18:46,620 --> 04:18:50,670
Does it feel like you have like a company meeting like

2036
04:18:52,250 --> 04:18:56,649
Everybody, okay. Let's talk about this. All right. Yes, uh, let's go over the day here

2037
04:18:57,129 --> 04:19:02,879
Uh, so we've uh, that's done. It's all right. The game's done. It's ready to ship

2038
04:19:03,680 --> 04:19:06,399
It's not fun at all. It's like the opposite of fun

2039
04:19:07,290 --> 04:19:11,049
Uh, I don't know what may have I don't know. Wait, wait, hold on. I'm lifting

2040
04:19:14,649 --> 04:19:17,680
Turn your arms out

2041
04:19:17,680 --> 04:19:45,450
What?

2042
04:19:45,450 --> 04:19:47,530
Do it turn it up, man

2043
04:19:49,629 --> 04:20:00,319
You're right

2044
04:20:00,319 --> 04:20:02,989
Do it

2045
04:20:02,989 --> 04:20:06,989
He did I did I lifted it. What do you mean? No lift he put it over his head

2046
04:20:08,680 --> 04:20:10,680
He put it over his head

2047
04:20:19,739 --> 04:20:28,920
Let's see if he let's see if he lifts it. I don't think he lifted it. I don't think he did

2048
04:20:29,559 --> 04:20:35,870
What was I saying?

2049
04:20:35,870 --> 04:20:54,110
It doesn't matter. Come on. You can do it

2050
04:20:54,190 --> 04:21:06,159
Come on, you can do it

2051
04:21:06,159 --> 04:21:14,760
balance

2052
04:21:14,760 --> 04:21:16,760
That's the world. That's personal best. That's the world record

2053
04:21:19,059 --> 04:21:21,879
230 kilograms

2054
04:21:21,879 --> 04:21:26,750
Wait, what's 474?

2055
04:21:27,790 --> 04:21:32,139
I couldn't make it that high

2056
04:21:32,139 --> 04:21:50,809
Wait, that's the lowest the minimum weight. That's so funny. That's the minimum

2057
04:21:51,129 --> 04:22:13,680
Is it this is the only reason why I stuck around for this long in this game is for judo only

2058
04:22:14,079 --> 04:22:18,750
You understand i'm gonna get punch kick throw

2059
04:22:19,799 --> 04:22:20,680
Jump

2060
04:22:20,680 --> 04:22:23,500
It's not good. Yep. Okay

2061
04:22:24,780 --> 04:22:26,940
Match the arrows to gain an advantage

2062
04:22:27,500 --> 04:22:31,399
once you have the advantage press a combination of

2063
04:22:31,959 --> 04:22:34,920
This just punch punch punch punch kick punch fight

2064
04:22:35,399 --> 04:22:42,120
The throne reduced okay

2065
04:22:42,120 --> 04:22:45,639
When in or performing a hold or a pin press r2 l2

2066
04:22:52,600 --> 04:22:55,159
I don't I kind of don't I didn't I don't get any of that, but it's all right. Let's go

2067
04:22:55,719 --> 04:23:02,159
Here we go 81 to 90 kilograms

2068
04:23:11,420 --> 04:23:13,420
Destroy this isn't a rhythm game

2069
04:23:28,620 --> 04:23:31,450
Nah, you didn't get me

2070
04:23:31,450 --> 04:23:40,670
Oh shit, what happened? Is this judo? Are we trying to take the tags off of each other's shirts?

2071
04:23:41,840 --> 04:23:50,299
escape

2072
04:23:50,299 --> 04:24:13,709
Wait, who won?

2073
04:24:16,159 --> 04:24:17,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait

2074
04:24:17,840 --> 04:24:37,399
I didn't read the rule. I I I didn't read the rules. It said move move move

2075
04:24:37,879 --> 04:24:42,440
L2 r2 r2 r2 r2 r2 and then mash the face buttons

2076
04:24:54,409 --> 04:24:56,889
Okay, i'm ready

2077
04:24:56,889 --> 04:25:02,139
Let's go throne

2078
04:25:09,770 --> 04:25:13,719
Nope, what is this?

2079
04:25:14,680 --> 04:25:16,889
What's wrong with me?

2080
04:25:16,889 --> 04:25:20,010
What is it? Was he doing the mandible claw? What just happened?

2081
04:25:30,510 --> 04:25:47,920
Why did I just fall down?

2082
04:25:47,920 --> 04:25:50,479
All right. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm done

2083
04:25:51,040 --> 04:26:01,040
I'm done

2084
04:26:01,040 --> 04:26:06,000
Why would you play the judo one if you don't know what judo is? I know judo is an event. It's a martial art

2085
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:08,000
We throw people in

2086
04:26:08,860 --> 04:26:10,860
If you get pinned you'll lose

2087
04:26:19,520 --> 04:26:22,079
That end of the stream voice

2088
04:26:22,159 --> 04:26:23,360
Yeah

2089
04:26:23,360 --> 04:26:25,120
Yeah, it probably is

2090
04:26:25,120 --> 04:26:31,290
It probably is

2091
04:26:31,290 --> 04:26:32,889
It probably is

2092
04:26:32,889 --> 04:26:39,200
That is accurate

2093
04:26:39,200 --> 04:26:41,040
Actually, I didn't do disc throw

2094
04:26:41,040 --> 04:26:46,200
Which is I want to do that

2095
04:26:46,200 --> 04:26:50,329
Not like it's gonna be any fun

2096
04:26:50,329 --> 04:27:00,959
But I plan on playing fall guys is what we're doing next to play that throw the disc out the window

2097
04:27:01,680 --> 04:27:02,879
no

2098
04:27:02,879 --> 04:27:05,200
Guys, i'm gonna put this back on ebay for a dollar five

2099
04:27:05,760 --> 04:27:08,799
I think that's what it was. It was like a dollar. It was a dollar and 10 cents

2100
04:27:09,600 --> 04:27:12,079
It was not more than a dollar. I know it wasn't it wasn't more than two

2101
04:27:13,319 --> 04:27:16,700
If it was then that's sad

2102
04:27:16,700 --> 04:27:19,659
When is movie night for real? I'll give you that I would give that to you right now

2103
04:27:21,129 --> 04:27:23,129
So the dlc, yeah

2104
04:27:23,610 --> 04:27:26,110
That came up on me out of nowhere

2105
04:27:26,110 --> 04:27:28,540
Uh dlc movie night

2106
04:27:28,620 --> 04:27:30,620
Uh at least like part one

2107
04:27:31,879 --> 04:27:33,399
is going to be

2108
04:27:33,399 --> 04:27:34,899
on

2109
04:27:34,899 --> 04:27:36,700
saturday

2110
04:27:36,700 --> 04:27:38,700
saturday the 29th

2111
04:27:38,700 --> 04:27:44,030
I think that gives me and some of the mods a lot of time to really get

2112
04:27:44,750 --> 04:27:49,879
a good playlist

2113
04:27:49,879 --> 04:27:53,959
They don't want to do it just like in the next week because I feel like there's a lot there's hundreds of them

2114
04:27:54,600 --> 04:27:57,680
So I really want to be able to go through those

2115
04:27:58,329 --> 04:28:00,829
So saturday the 29th

2116
04:28:00,829 --> 04:28:02,829
I'll get on your calendar. That's dlc movie night

2117
04:28:06,799 --> 04:28:10,239
So long from now, it's gonna go by real quick. I promise

2118
04:28:11,280 --> 04:28:28,809
I don't get it. I don't know how it works

2119
04:28:29,690 --> 04:28:31,770
But I will see you guys again. This is the

2120
04:28:32,569 --> 04:28:34,729
First time i've done two streams in a row since coming back

2121
04:28:36,940 --> 04:28:38,780
I have some stuff to do

2122
04:28:38,780 --> 04:28:40,219
Over this weekend

2123
04:28:40,219 --> 04:28:44,829
I'm gonna go do it. I'm gonna take care of it

2124
04:28:45,389 --> 04:28:48,079
And i'll see you guys on monday

2125
04:28:48,079 --> 04:28:50,799
Still continuing to ease back into live streaming

2126
04:28:53,159 --> 04:28:55,399
And I feel okay. I actually feel okay. I feel pretty good

2127
04:28:57,479 --> 04:28:59,639
but I don't want to

2128
04:28:59,639 --> 04:29:00,600
Push it

2129
04:29:00,600 --> 04:29:02,840
So I don't really want to do three days in a row

2130
04:29:02,840 --> 04:29:06,170
I really want to get up and move around

2131
04:29:07,079 --> 04:29:14,600
But I will see you guys on monday. I think that's a good place to start. We'll probably do

2132
04:29:17,530 --> 04:29:19,530
monday tuesday

2133
04:29:19,690 --> 04:29:23,690
Probably monday tuesday thursday if I would say next week

2134
04:29:24,250 --> 04:29:26,280
I think that makes a lot of sense

2135
04:29:26,280 --> 04:29:31,920
Because those of you that might be out of the loop. I just I know I say this at the end of every stream the last

2136
04:29:33,500 --> 04:29:35,500
Three or four streams since I come back

2137
04:29:35,899 --> 04:29:37,899
But i'm going backwards

2138
04:29:38,780 --> 04:29:39,579
to

2139
04:29:39,579 --> 04:29:44,700
Streaming less sort of how long I streamed and times I streamed before moving to vegas

2140
04:29:46,110 --> 04:29:48,110
I streamed probably three days a week

2141
04:29:48,510 --> 04:29:51,389
Back when I was in massachusetts for about four to six hours

2142
04:29:51,950 --> 04:29:53,790
So we're going back to that

2143
04:29:53,790 --> 04:30:01,680
This medical stuff is still ongoing. So i'm gonna keep it that way. I'm gonna keep it like it was a few years ago

2144
04:30:04,750 --> 04:30:05,709
so

2145
04:30:05,709 --> 04:30:08,750
I've had a lot of fun though sponge bob was a lot of fun these games

2146
04:30:08,750 --> 04:30:12,510
Well, then this one not so much, but 2012 was actually great. I had a lot of fun

2147
04:30:13,149 --> 04:30:20,030
Hope you enjoyed it. We'll see you maybe again on monday. Have a great weekend everybody. Let's see if I fixed the credits

2148
04:30:20,030 --> 04:30:21,870
I tried again today

2149
04:30:21,870 --> 04:30:25,239
I really did. Let's see if it worked

2150
04:30:25,799 --> 04:30:27,799
Here come all the subs maybe

2151
04:30:28,540 --> 04:30:30,540
Hey, I finally got it to work

2152
04:30:30,860 --> 04:30:32,620
This is not in the right spot

2153
04:30:32,620 --> 04:30:44,959
And the font is weird. Why is the font so weird? I'll fix that

2154
04:30:46,750 --> 04:30:49,500
But thanks everybody for subbing

2155
04:30:49,500 --> 04:30:54,399
We had some community subs. We had a lot 50 community subs today from suck mcjones

2156
04:30:55,739 --> 04:30:59,319
Thank you. That's a huge amount of money

2157
04:30:59,319 --> 04:31:05,469
Do a different font to every stream

2158
04:31:06,350 --> 04:31:11,819
Do I need to teach you how to use obs? No, i'm telling you i've done this correct

2159
04:31:12,299 --> 04:31:17,239
Every time I didn't change anything. Why did it change two months after me streaming? It doesn't make any sense

2160
04:31:17,239 --> 04:31:19,799
I didn't change anything. I don't like when things change around me

2161
04:31:20,360 --> 04:31:29,149
There's no music. What the hell am I doing? There's still no music sneak up on this sniper

2162
04:31:30,620 --> 04:31:35,610
Wait, why what was that?

2163
04:31:35,610 --> 04:31:37,610
Why was that so loud? What was that?

2164
04:31:45,229 --> 04:31:47,239
um

2165
04:31:47,239 --> 04:31:49,149
This is bizarre

2166
04:31:49,149 --> 04:31:51,149
Why is this right now?

2167
04:31:52,280 --> 04:31:54,280
on my browser source

2168
04:31:58,889 --> 04:32:00,889
Wait a minute this this needs to be explored

2169
04:32:05,040 --> 04:32:06,399
vlog

2170
04:32:06,399 --> 04:32:09,579
overwatch

2171
04:32:09,579 --> 04:32:11,819
Is this a muselk video?

2172
04:32:16,219 --> 04:32:18,940
Why is this here?

2173
04:32:18,940 --> 04:32:21,950
I didn't do this

2174
04:32:22,430 --> 04:32:26,750
Out of the water. I mean, I didn't do this. I didn't put this here

2175
04:32:26,909 --> 04:32:30,110
You know like will the game I swear to god, I don't know why this is here

2176
04:32:30,590 --> 04:32:35,309
You go in and it's just like can you click on people and that decides whether or not you're gonna win the game or not

2177
04:32:35,389 --> 04:32:40,350
Is this like part of a playlist of a video that we watched yesterday? So addictive so fun. It has to be right

2178
04:32:40,430 --> 04:32:43,549
I mean like i'm like trembling right now. It was just it was insane

2179
04:32:43,549 --> 04:32:46,590
It was just awesome and I can't wait to get a chance to play it again

2180
04:32:46,989 --> 04:32:50,430
Uh, there was this one thing I have no way. Well, there's muselk. I don't know why this is here

2181
04:32:58,350 --> 04:33:00,989
I have no explanation for that. I can't even tell you why that may have happened

2182
04:33:01,549 --> 04:33:04,349
Is this a setup for a joke? No, I have no idea why that happened

2183
04:33:04,349 --> 04:33:08,110
It was just my I went over to the my ending scene. I turned my audio on

2184
04:33:08,669 --> 04:33:10,669
And it was in the middle of a video

2185
04:33:11,560 --> 04:33:13,639
Probably a second or third or fourth video

2186
04:33:14,360 --> 04:33:18,200
Or maybe even like a 100th video that just was playing recommended over and over again all stream

2187
04:33:18,759 --> 04:33:21,840
I had my I don't know that could have been happening

2188
04:33:25,479 --> 04:33:32,090
It's very possible that this browser source was just playing videos in the background. Whatever

2189
04:33:32,569 --> 04:33:38,299
All right. I will see you guys on monday. You want who should we raid? Let's raid somebody who's available right now

2190
04:33:38,860 --> 04:33:41,389
Who's available and what are they doing? It's very important

2191
04:33:46,360 --> 04:33:48,360
Star's playing heart stone

2192
04:33:53,200 --> 04:33:56,080
Yeah, let's go say hi to star we actually were just talking the other day

2193
04:33:58,319 --> 04:34:02,159
Great star

2194
04:34:02,159 --> 04:34:06,639
It's very rare that I actually catch him streaming. He's probably gonna be he's probably gonna be like mad

2195
04:34:07,200 --> 04:34:08,959
And they just can't

2196
04:34:08,959 --> 04:34:10,560
All right, be nice

2197
04:34:10,560 --> 04:34:15,549
We're done. We'll do

2198
04:34:15,549 --> 04:34:17,549
I'll see you guys on monday. Have a great weekend

2199
04:34:17,950 --> 04:34:24,380
The bio you were talking about streaming together. Yeah, we we were talking about these games to play

2200
04:34:27,240 --> 04:34:29,240
I'll see you guys on monday

2201
04:34:31,680 --> 04:34:39,099
Please criticize every move he does in hearthstone tonight end
