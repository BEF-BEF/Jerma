00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:14,519
Hello, good afternoon everybody. How you doing? Good to see you again. It's always good to see you.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:25,699
So today we're going to play a game that's been highly highly recommended to me in the discord

3
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:34,789
channel and here. I don't know why. The game is called Frog Detective and I mean it does it the

4
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:43,289
frog is in the title so I have to play. I got this thing going since like 2012 where every single

5
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,170
video game with frog in the title I have to play it at some point so that's what we're doing today.

6
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:58,890
Does it have candy in it? I don't know. This game is only like an hour long so the other plan is

7
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:06,140
once we get through frog detective is we're going to do a part two of community content night.

8
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:11,400
Somebody told you we're going to split it into two and we're going to do it next weekend and

9
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:20,739
here we are. Community content night part two will be after frog detective one.

10
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,959
Let's go over those of you that weren't here a couple days ago. We talked about the schedule

11
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:38,260
coming up here. It's going to get a little weird. I have some old friends that have come into town

12
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:48,469
and they are going to be here for a week. A full week. So I've got to take some time to

13
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,390
show them around Vegas. Some of them it's their first time for being here so

14
00:01:53,349 --> 00:02:02,500
old Boston friends coming in. On top of that I have sort of the final stretch of my

15
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,439
medical mystery that there's a couple appointments coming up this week.

16
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:17,319
Next week is what I mean. So it's going to be interesting but not next week like the week

17
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,210
after next. The first week of February. So there's not going to be a stream tomorrow.

18
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,500
That's where it starts but as of Tuesday we're going to start early on Tuesday. Very early

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,370
because I got something going on later in the evening on Tuesday. But as of Tuesday we're

20
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,629
going to go five days in a row. We're going to go Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday

21
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,699
and then after that after the five day super stream you are not going to see me for at least

22
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,939
six days. That's what I'm going to be taking the week off. So I figured if I'm going to take

23
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,419
six days off I want to stream like six days in a week. You know what I'm saying?

24
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:08,330
I don't just want to disappear. But that's the plan. Nothing tomorrow, something today

25
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:15,449
and then we do five days in a row. He's never coming back after that one. What am I going to

26
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:27,990
do for six days? I don't know. Knit a sweater. Do a knot tying class. Go work on something cool.

27
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:36,020
Eat a good breakfast at least one of those days. When I'm gone I want you to eat a

28
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:42,819
fucking really good breakfast. I'm talking like greens, tomatoes, beans and shit. Have like a

29
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:48,020
full good spread and think about me while you're doing that. Be like he fucking told me to do this

30
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:55,270
shit. Tell me to have like the beans and tomatoes and some nice like green sauteed eggs. I want you

31
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:02,169
to think of me when you do that. What do you mean? What are you? Beans for breakfast?

32
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:08,919
Hold on a minute. What you what you guys don't what do you mean beans for breakfast? What the

33
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:17,180
fuck? What's wrong with you? What are you talking about? Like that's English. That's English style.

34
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,379
You guys don't have English style breakfast in England? This like 12% of my audience is from

35
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:36,329
England. How come I'm not seeing more yeses? England isn't real. That's an English style

36
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:43,209
beans, toast, eggs, tomatoes, sausages. Come on that's an English style breakfast. That's

37
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:51,319
what my mother used to tell me. Was she lying to me? No she wasn't. Kim says that too. I got two

38
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:58,100
people versus you of like 3000. Sorry guys. Anyways we're gonna play frog. Just gonna chill

39
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,459
for a little bit. Play frog detective. This has been very very highly requested. I don't know why

40
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:11,670
but it was. It's true. Yeah I know. Let's put it on. I don't know anything about this game. It just

41
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,149
looks kind of like a cute detective game. Just okay all the Drew crew that's here.

42
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:27,139
Just imagine. This is Nancy Drew's of frog now okay. Can you see it? There you go.

43
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:38,389
Why does every game have to have a crew? Why can't we just play video games? Why is it why is my

44
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:46,500
stream in my community every game is a different country? Why can't we just why do I have to have

45
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:58,810
a crew for every game? This game fun? I already know. Okay all right let's see. Do it. Yeah I

46
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:07,449
know it's gonna get spammed. Do it. Use the mouse to look around. All right super frog detective.

47
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:20,970
W A S D is moving around. Okay it's me. Well the phone's ringing. This is not even

48
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:34,310
fucking 90 FOV. Fucking refunded. Hello. Who is it? It's the supervisor. Hi supervisor. Hey how's

49
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,089
life? Yeah pretty good I reckon. How are things with you? Me and the wife just got back from

50
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:48,139
Indonesia. Oh well tell them I dare you to come Bali. That means welcome back I think. Thanks.

51
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:56,089
Anyway what are you calling about? Oh right. I have a case for you. Who? It's a pretty spooky

52
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:02,779
one so hold on tight. I'm holding on. It's a little sloth who owns an island just off the bay.

53
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,339
Martin's his name. Says he's been here in a ghost for about two weeks.

54
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,019
So get this. He hires a team of ghost scientists. I'm not gonna do this whole stream. What's a ghost

55
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:21,529
scientist? I don't know. Anyway he hires some of them right and they can't find anything.

56
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:29,100
They've been on the island for two weeks. Whoa! The ghost is still at large so the head scientist

57
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,860
there a monkey calls me up. They need help and they want the greatest investigator I have.

58
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,980
So I said to them I'll send my best investigator but lobster cop wasn't available. This game like

59
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:48,660
30 minutes. Well this is this is precious game time real estate. We're running out of time.

60
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,699
So I'm asking you the second best investigator. I fully understand lobster cop's abilities far

61
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:02,819
outweigh my own. Yeah but you're pretty good. So are you up for it? I don't know it sounds scary.

62
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:08,899
I should be very brave. I believe in you detective. That's what I need to hear. Thank you supervisor.

63
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:19,959
I get okay. Wahoo! Can you give me a summary of the case before I go? Auto voice. Sure thing.

64
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,439
The basics are there's a slow... wait is this kids game? How old do you have to be to play this?

65
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,220
Well okay what's this what's the cutoff ceiling for age for playing this game?

66
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,080
Because I know like there's like cute games right? Oh that's cute game for kids

67
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,240
but if you're over the age of eight like it's don't even play it right like is this one of them?

68
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,960
There's a sloth who's hearing a lot of spooky ghost noises around his island.

69
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,039
He calls a bunch of ghost scientists but they're stumped. It's up to you to solve the mystery of

70
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:54,789
the haunted island. Why did you just tell haunted islands at me? Because that's the title of the

71
00:08:54,789 --> 00:09:03,879
case. Time for you to grab your magnifying glass and get going. See you later supervisor. Good

72
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:22,980
luck. Thanks. I'm not a cutoff age for video games if you like it Jerma. Ah yes I thought this is a

73
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,340
mirror. Ah yes my trusty magnifying glass can't solve mysteries without it. Now I can right click

74
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:37,460
to see up close. But I can't do the thing. I can't do the thing that they do in every single... what

75
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:44,820
was last time you ever you saw magnifying glass in any form of media? It wasn't this. The magnifying

76
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:53,610
glass is not... they don't use it anymore. Nancy Drew. No no I'm talking like I'm talking... all

77
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,610
right let me rephrase that. Media that has been consumed by more than a million people

78
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,179
right? Like when was the last time you saw? Not don't... Nancy Drew's doesn't count.

79
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:15,220
Sherlock Holmes. Time to solve a mystery. Do they even use magnifying glasses in Sherlock Holmes?

80
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:27,769
Grace Ruxner presents Super Frog. I'm gonna say that like a thousand times this stream you

81
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:49,289
know I am. Frog Detective Adventure. How far away does Super Frog live? This is kind of loud. I'll

82
00:10:49,289 --> 00:11:08,649
turn it down. It's on an island starring the detective Mark, Larry, Moe the Mouse, Bernie,

83
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:26,360
Fresh X, and the rest. Case one. The haunted island. This is just like cutouts. Okay the haunted

84
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:40,340
island. I'm ready. So I have to solve the case. Do a Kermit voice. Well this is a really small

85
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:48,659
island. I don't think it's gonna be that hard to figure this out considering... like do you have

86
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:54,139
one camera that's pointed at the island? That's all I need. Just even if it's low it's not even

87
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:58,600
HD. Okay what do you want?

88
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,259
Of course I remember. I don't remember.

89
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,220
Who should I talk to first? You're talking to me already. Okay who should I talk to second?

90
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:27,059
The other way around. I'll check it out. Thanks. What would you like to know? The resident. May I

91
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,820
ask who the resident of this island is? Oh that would be Martin. You can find him hiding in the

92
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,940
forest. He thinks the ghost can't catch him there. Hmm very interesting. I'll investigate.

93
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:48,919
But what would you like to know? Nothing. I'll come back after I did some stuff. See you around.

94
00:13:49,720 --> 00:14:06,789
What does it say on this thing? Hmm maybe a man in a suit. Was playing this the compromise?

95
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:20,179
The compromise you have with the Drew crew. What is that? Wait can I pick this up?

96
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:36,330
Patrick. No it's not. Okay what is it? What is this? There's cookies? Macaroni. Yum it's not mine.

97
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:49,299
Hey uh you're that detective right? The one that uh monkey keeps on going on about.

98
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:57,190
That's me. I'm so glad they finally brought someone else in. I know nothing. I really shouldn't have

99
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:05,769
taken the job. Why did you take it? Oh I'll be honest. I thought it was a secret agent job.

100
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:13,700
That's what I thought. Why would you think that? Job listing said ghost scientist. That didn't seem

101
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:25,450
like a real job to me. I thought it was uh like a cover you know. One that only smart people could

102
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:33,139
figure out like me. It still could be a cover. Maybe they're testing you. Oh no no no no you're

103
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:41,559
right. I better look competent. I'm only joking. Sure. Can I ask you some questions about Casey?

104
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:54,460
What else do you want to know? What do you know about noise coming from cows? I mean I'm not

105
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,779
great at this. I'd be good at other jobs. Just letting you know. But it does seem like the noise

106
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:07,929
is coming from this hole. From a natural creature. They seem to be otherworldly somehow. They have a

107
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:16,149
weird and distinct tongue. Sometimes it sounds like a bird's call. But only sometimes. Oh that's

108
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:25,299
not good information. Yes I'm very good at finding things out. If you know what I mean. Bernie I'm

109
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:36,179
not a secret agent. Uh-huh. What else do you want to know? He's not paying attention beyond the

110
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:42,740
impression. Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding we figured it out. I'm not paying

111
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,179
attention to the story at all. I'm just making sure that I sound like Bernie Sanders.

112
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,419
That's it. That's all I cared about. I don't know anything. I don't even know what he just said.

113
00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:06,039
I have no idea what's happening right now. Okay let's let's pay attention. Let me let me figure

114
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:14,950
this out. About the hole. And this too. This is making me dumb. This is making me. I'm thinking

115
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,910
dumb. You know what you think about noise coming from cows? Like I'm not even processing that

116
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:29,640
information. It's just I'm losing IQ points when I do detectives. Frog detectives. Okay here we go.

117
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:39,180
What do you know about the noises coming from this hole? I mean I'm not great at this. But I'd be

118
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:44,519
good at some other stuff. Just letting you know I don't have a problem with you. It just seems like

119
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,440
the noise is coming from the hole. I'm from a natural creature. I know all kinds of creatures

120
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:56,150
in my life. They seem otherworldly somehow. They were weird. All right. All right. I have to pay

121
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:04,539
attention. No more voices. We're done. Birds call. Only sometimes. Okay birds call. Do Obama?

122
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:17,910
I'm not sure that I can. I'm willing to give it a try. On the next film. Wait wait wait.

123
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,839
All right. Why do you want to be a secret agent? Secret agents get the best stuff.

124
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,440
Like for example you've got a cool magnifying glass. I want one of those.

125
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:46,150
Okay. Sure you're not. Yeah. Bernie Winks. Hey. Oh hey hey. Look at me. Look at. Even if I can't be

126
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:53,509
secret agent. Things I give up. I would love a magnifying glass. All right. There's nothing

127
00:18:53,509 --> 00:19:00,599
I want more. You want a magnifying glass. You just give them mine. All right. Nothing. That's it.

128
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:06,680
I was saving my points for that. But now you can save them for something else.

129
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,880
Like making one of my emotes black and white. Which just makes it harder to see.

130
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:30,180
Thanks for the channel points. Hey. It's me Larry. Hey. I did not do it.

131
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:41,880
Huh? The noises are not coming from me. I didn't. I Larry did not make these spooky noises.

132
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:51,130
That's suspicious. What? Are you even listening to me? I said I didn't make those noises.

133
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:57,500
No I heard. I just. I don't like being accused like this. I'm not. Oh you're not accusing me?

134
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:08,680
That's such a relief. Can I. Are you going to ask me a question? Yeah ask me the questions I

135
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:17,779
mean. What can you tell me about the noises? Firstly I am not the one making them. I'm not

136
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:28,380
making the noises. Yeah. But I know where they're coming from. What? They're coming from the cave

137
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:36,279
in the forest. Why haven't you told anybody? Nobody listens to me. They say stuff like well

138
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:43,460
Larry if you won't listen to us we won't listen to you. Which is so weird because I do listen.

139
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:50,900
Maybe they. I'm a really great listener. So how do we get into the. This is just evil Bernie.

140
00:20:52,839 --> 00:21:06,059
Evil Bernie Sanders. How do we get into the cave? Well I need a few things. To get through there

141
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:12,490
you'll need some sort of explosive device. Is that safe? We're dealing with ghosts here detective.

142
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,779
None of this is safe. Anyway I'll need a few things. I looked up an explosive recipe in one

143
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:23,460
of the old chemistry books. I need toothpaste, some wool, a chunk of pure gold and some pasta.

144
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:31,210
Oh so the normal explosive ingredient. There's a standard explosive recipe. Yes.

145
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,980
You want to get into that cave? Bring me those ingredients. I'll do my best.

146
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:49,130
Ask me then the question now. You have to do a. I'll try. Not next. Let's make some dynamite.

147
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:57,529
Not yet detective. We still need toothpaste, some wool, a chunk of pure gold and some pasta.

148
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:05,849
Okay. All right. I need. So I need. Oh yeah. So give me that. How do I get that pasta?

149
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:32,150
I need this. Yum. It's not mine. Take it. What are you doing? Howdy. What are you doing in there?

150
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:43,670
But there's a storm. It's not raining yet. Besides it's not actually that unsafe

151
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:52,140
to swim in the storm. Everyone keeps telling me to get out of the sea. But it's safer in here

152
00:22:52,700 --> 00:23:04,150
and it is up there. Why is that? No ghosts in the water. Ghosts can't swim. How do you know?

153
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:18,220
Uh, Martin said you don't look happy in there. I guess I'm not. Sorry to hear. Thanks.

154
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:33,140
Ask you why you're so sad. Well, it's kind of silly. I really want a magnet. I told you it's silly.

155
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:45,930
Why do you want a magnet? Well, go on. My dream is to attach a magnet to a boat and, uh, hold on.

156
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:58,359
Oh, why? Boats are fast. I'm not fast. I hold on to the magnet. I'll be really fast too. Nice.

157
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:08,700
Right. I don't have any idea where to find one though. And even if I did, there's, there's no way

158
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:17,579
I'm getting out of that water here to that ghost is found. That's interesting. Is there anything

159
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:31,029
you need to know? All right. Let's process information now. Time to process info. All right.

160
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:34,470
Why did you want the magnet? So I can attach it to the back of a boat and zoom along. All right.

161
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,549
So you want a magnet so you can zoom along. Okay. If it's sweetens it, I can give you this big shell

162
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:44,900
in return for a magnet. I thought it might be magnetic, but it's not. Let's process info for

163
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,859
this like kids game that I'm not going to be able to complete because I'm doing, I'm doing like

164
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:59,579
precedents and presidential candidates. Oh no. God damn it. Okay. How was I supposed to know?

165
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:06,359
What am I? Scientist. Okay. Is there anything else you need to know? All right. We need to get a

166
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:17,349
magnet so we get the shell. We need a magnet so we can get the shell. We need pasta to get the

167
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:27,420
bomb. We need a magnet to get the shell. There's so many, there's a million people here. All right.

168
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:38,710
What is this? Is that a magnifying glass? Stop right there. Stop it. Stop right there. Why?

169
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:49,160
My shells. My shells. Don't step on my shells please. Oh, I won't. We can't be sure of that.

170
00:25:50,740 --> 00:26:01,509
I guess not. They're very fragile and very small. Be careful. Aren't we all? I get, please just,

171
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:09,940
please be careful. Don't touch them. Don't step on them. Okay. You're still going to stand like that?

172
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:24,490
Yeah. Why? I'm alarmed. I'm on alert. I am protecting my shells from dangerous feet.

173
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:36,950
Wow. Sorry. I just worked up about my shells. I don't mean to be rude, but what shells?

174
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:46,299
I can't see any shells. That's because they're small. But me, very large. I have very big hands.

175
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:55,700
Shells are small. Hands enormous. How small? Too small for your weak magnifying glass.

176
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:02,660
Wow. So I'm sorry. It's the truth. It's the truth. It's just the truth.

177
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,099
I had to get this one specifically made for my tiny shells.

178
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:18,789
Fine. Can I ask you some questions? Ask me questions. Just be careful. Don't touch them.

179
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:24,819
Don't get near them. I will one. No, no, not you. No, no, no, no. You're from the fake news.

180
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:34,859
Somebody else, please. Me? Okay. Why don't you just get a bigger shell?

181
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:49,559
Ha. You fool. Hey. Hey. Sorry. It's just that there's not many big shells around here.

182
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,519
If I could get one shell. We got to get the shell to get the magnifying glass to get the pasta.

183
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:03,769
All right. We need shell. We need magnet to get shell to get magnifying glass. Okay.

184
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:09,910
Okay. All right. All right. Ask me questions. We got it. We got it. We got it. What about that

185
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:25,380
cave? This guy's a partisan streamer. Do you know anything about that cave? Oh, what? No.

186
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:35,259
No, I don't know. It might not. It could be a cave. It might not be a cave. It couldn't. It

187
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:39,980
might just be a small dark place. That doesn't need to be a cave. Who knows? Could be anything.

188
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:49,460
Looks like a pile of rock. There's a cave. Well, I guess we'll agree to disagree.

189
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:56,569
It's literally a confirmed cave. A potato, potato. You know, you do, you add to me.

190
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:04,359
Okay. Let's make sure we, let's make sure we do Trump correctly. The only way I'm telling,

191
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:11,000
listen to me. The cam has to go on for this because Donald Trump is one of the only voices

192
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,880
where you have to actually move around. Like I am. Okay. Like my hands come up in the air like

193
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,880
this and cross like this and I close my fingers. I don't know. I just that you have to move around.

194
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:28,099
I, I'm very, and I'm very limited. Like I, I, this doesn't do anything, but I don't know why

195
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:39,849
you just have to do it. You're a gobbler. Get out of here. Okay. Really? Yeah. Fair enough.

196
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:48,549
Ask me questions. Just be careful. I changed this one halfway through. Now it's somebody else.

197
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,789
Okay. I haven't paid attention to anything. Now I know. Okay. All right. All right. All right.

198
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:04,220
Right. What's the first step though? What's the first item we need magnet? Oh God. We need

199
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:10,710
potion. We need potion to get shell, to get magnet, to get boat, to get fucking pasta, to get.

200
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:34,440
All right. Let's, we gotta get for the first one. Hi. Hello. You okay? Yeah. Are you sure? Well,

201
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,890
I have just never talked to a detective before. I've heard so many nice things about you.

202
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:52,490
I don't want to be embarrassing. If I am embarrassing, that would be very bad.

203
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:56,549
You're not embarrassing. That's very good news.

204
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:11,400
The conversation isn't over. There's still time. I have to be careful. Oh, well, it's okay. If I

205
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:24,019
ask you some questions. You have questions for me? Questions, yes. You seem very nervous. Why?

206
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:35,799
Oh, because of the detective thing. I told you. I'm afraid of detectives. Maybe when I was a kid,

207
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:41,930
I had a bad dream about a detective. Something like that. I don't know. Sorry to hear about your

208
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:55,880
dream. What? What? What? No, it's because this is close. I know why people are fucking mad right

209
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:03,400
now. Because this is getting really close to the thing that everybody fucking hates. I know. And

210
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:16,440
now everyone's like, no, don't shut up. Hey, I'm available. And you can feel and you're like, no,

211
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,720
no, no, no, no. If he says, if he says this with this voice, and he says an A and then a Y followed

212
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:37,720
by an A followed by a Y followed by a second A, I'm going to leave the stream. All right, fine.

213
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,359
Eric, I didn't have a dream about that. Why are you afraid of me?

214
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:58,660
Sorry about that. Fine. You've worn me down. Damn your extreme detective skills. I'm nervous

215
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:05,160
because of Mystery Monkey. Mystery Monkey is a huge fan of your blog, so I don't want to make

216
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:11,079
a fool of myself in front of you. I just think Mystery Monkey is super neat. I don't want to

217
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:20,279
be embarrassing in a case I mess up everything. Oh, well, is there anything I can do to help you?

218
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:27,720
There's a dance competition coming up tomorrow. I want to compete and show Mystery Monkey that

219
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,220
I'm really good at dancing, but I don't know what style of dance will impress them.

220
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:42,170
Would you ask Mystery Monkey and find out for me? I can give you this mouse wash mouth wash in return.

221
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:51,299
Sure. Questions, yes. I'll take them. The cream of the crop. The cream of the crop.

222
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
If you could do me just one favor, man.

223
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:02,920
Fucking God damn it. All right. That bottle, what do you got in there? What's in the bottle next to

224
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,680
you? That's my mouth wash. Give it to me. I'm having to give you to find out what type of dance

225
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:16,150
style. All right, we're going to go Mystery Monkey. Okay, do it in Randy Savage is one of those voices

226
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:25,269
that if you go all out and you really go on, you really your voice will be hurt and pain for three

227
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:33,380
days after you do it. Guaranteed. I don't know how he did that so often. He must have had a voice

228
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:41,289
made out of his vocal cords are probably made out of fucking iron. Like it's just so much pressure

229
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:47,699
coming out of your throat at the same time. So much pressure. That was a fucking legend.

230
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:55,769
All right. All right. All right. We need to go. Dude, we got to talk to the monkey. I'll come back.

231
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:59,530
I'm getting that bottle. This is supposed to take 30 minutes to beat this game. I've already beaten

232
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:14,090
the game once. All right. Where's you? What kind of dance do you like? I forgot his voice.

233
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:20,360
Questions, yes. What would you like to know? What is your favorite dance style?

234
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:37,260
Hey, so you you like dancing and dance styles? I don't understand. I like dancing a lot if that's

235
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,510
what you're asking. Yeah, kind of. What type of dancing do you like the most out of all dancing?

236
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:52,139
Well, I basically have one move. Yeah, but yeah, if you saw someone dancing, what scenario would

237
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:59,130
you most likely be? This is such a good dance to me. What? I guess what I'm trying to ask is

238
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:05,289
what dance style do you like the best? I have to pay attention. I think break dancing is so neat.

239
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:10,489
If I saw someone break dancing, wow, I would swoon. I would even go so far to say if I saw.

240
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:18,980
I did Randy Savage for one second and like it hurts. I did it for one second. It's all right.

241
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,659
I can't do any more voices with the rest of the screen. I'd be deeply impressed myself

242
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:27,300
if somebody breakdanced that I would want to hang out with them at all times forever. That's great.

243
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:36,980
I got look, I got a lot of proven that could be whiskey, but it's not. It's water that's been

244
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:45,670
poured over coffee beans and then drained into a glass. Still water, technically. All right. Sorry,

245
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,030
touch change question. That's OK. I'm not sure it's important to the case. All right. So now

246
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:58,300
let's go get the mouthwash. Got a monkey fact. Thanks for injuring yourself at the beginning

247
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:03,690
of the stream. I feel like I've done that like five times already. I've hurt myself

248
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:15,159
during a stream and I'm just like, well, ouch, see you in six hours. Oh, a broom.

249
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:33,320
Got a broom. All right. So what? Look, it's you. Can I pick it up? All right. Here we go.

250
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:45,900
I want that mouthwash. We have some questions. Questions. Yes. I'm going to do a fake Randy

251
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:53,780
Savage. Hey, I talked to Mystery Monkey. Oh, my gosh. Did you mention me? What did Mystery Monkey

252
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:03,909
say? Does Mystery Monkey hate me? So embarrassed. I didn't mention you. That's just Joel. Yeah.

253
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:09,829
Doesn't Joel do a really good? This is just a bad Joel. He does like a perfect Randy Savage.

254
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:18,710
I could never compare. Yeah, I couldn't. Mystery Monkey likes breakdancing the best.

255
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:35,780
Joel basically is Randy Savage. That's fucking funny. Breakdancing? I think I could do that.

256
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:43,530
I got to start practicing now, though. Good luck. Thanks. Oh, here's the mouthwash before I forget.

257
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:50,070
Cheers. All right. Got the mouthwash. Now what the hell do we need to do with this?

258
00:38:50,070 --> 00:39:12,980
Oh, dude, fucking stream is going to be bopping real soon. It even looks like the same character.

259
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:20,170
That's what's fucked up. Somebody link that gif. This is the same character. It's the same dance

260
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:34,539
and it's the same person. So I need Char. We haven't talked to you. Who are you?

261
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:46,300
Who are you? Who are you? I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Frog Detective. Oh, okay. Don't sneak

262
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:54,150
up on me like that. I was visible for the entire approach. Well, fine. I guess I just don't look

263
00:39:54,150 --> 00:40:05,079
so smirky. Okay, I'll do my best. Sorry, I'm so cranky. I haven't slept in two weeks. I'm Martin,

264
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:13,460
king of the island. You're a king? Well, when I got here, there was nobody else on the island

265
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:25,480
except for me and Finley. So I thought I was fine to declare myself as king. Finley? I don't think

266
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,880
Finley cares about that sort of stuff. Finley mostly cares about the dance competition.

267
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:43,639
No, I meant to ask who's Finley. Oh, okay then. Can I ask you a few questions?

268
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:57,179
Go ahead. Not questions for me. Dance competition. You mentioned dance competition. Can you tell me

269
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:04,889
a little more about that than you said? It's tomorrow. Anything else? Oh, the best dancer wins.

270
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:12,969
Okay. You got questions for me? This accent's changing every fucking half second. I'm being

271
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:19,219
ripped through like portals. I'm being ripped through like accent portals. I can't pick one.

272
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:28,579
He's moving from country to country to country. Who's Finley? Someone's playing with the slider.

273
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:37,510
Yeah. You mentioned your friend Finley. Who's that guy? Finley lives on an hippie island and

274
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:44,699
comes to visit me every few days. The last time I saw Finley, she was talking about this song.

275
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:51,579
She wanted to dance to her day competition. Her moves were pretty amazing. Not like me.

276
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:58,250
She'll probably win. I haven't seen her in a while, but she's probably still prepping for

277
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:05,530
the competition. It is tomorrow. Not that I'll be in to complain to her with what the hell's

278
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:21,579
broken situation going on. Got questions for me? What about the noises? Can you tell me about the

279
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:34,139
noises and where they come from? I'm not exactly sure where they come from, but I know they're

280
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:48,409
coming from a ghost. How do you know for sure? I have a book about ghosts. It's called The Ghost

281
00:42:48,409 --> 00:42:54,789
Guide, Food-Proof Ways to Detect a Spirit. I've read most of it. Anyway, in the book it says

282
00:42:54,789 --> 00:43:11,289
that most ghosts can't be seen. Get this? I haven't seen a single one yet. The proof is all there.

283
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:21,460
Got questions for me? The American accent is seriously like, do you have questions for me?

284
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:28,170
You got questions for me? You got questions for me? You have questions for me? You guys have seen

285
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:34,090
that video? It's one of my favorite videos. It's a dictionary talking about accents.

286
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:42,329
On some websites you can have a definition of a word, right? It's stand. You guys have seen this

287
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:50,940
video? Stand versus stand. British versus American. I've told this already. There's a lot of new people

288
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:57,820
here. There's a website where you can place different accents for different words. One of

289
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:05,460
the words is stand. The person clicks on the English speaking version of it and it's like

290
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:11,780
stand. And then they click on the just American English and it goes stand.

291
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:25,659
It sounds like so bad. Stunned. Stunned. Did you find it? You found it. Good. Yeah.

292
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,460
It's like just one of them just sounds so elegant and the other one's just like,

293
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:56,889
whatever. Read the YouTube comments? Stand. Stand.

294
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:13,849
It's funny every time, man. I haven't seen this video in a while. It's funny every time.

295
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:38,139
Stand. Stand. One more time. One more time. We'll move on. Stand. Stand. What is the only

296
00:45:38,460 --> 00:46:05,639
comment? But yeah, that's like, that's so funny. One year ago, a year ago. Yeah,

297
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,840
we've talked about this is one of my favorite YouTube videos. Just having 82,000 views

298
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,840
is just, it's criminal. This should not be, this should be at like 820 million views.

299
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:28,360
I think I, yeah, I showed you guys this like a year ago, but you know, I thought your favorite

300
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:34,199
video was the hog calling contest. It's changed a little bit over the years. It's changed a little

301
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:55,690
bit. Wait, hold on. That's a re-upload. Oh, well, whatever. All right. What about your nerves?

302
00:46:56,409 --> 00:47:03,860
You seem super nervous. Is there something I can do to help you? It's just the ghost getting me

303
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:11,610
down. I haven't been able to sleep. Kind of annoyed too, because I usually love hearing

304
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:18,730
stories about ghosts. Read all about them on the cyberweb.com. But now, I'm living one.

305
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,750
I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of things. Bottom of the grave more like a...

306
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:32,090
What? That made more sense in my head. I guess I mean like we'll probably die before the mystery

307
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:41,750
is solved. That's pretty dark. Dark, just like the conclusion of this tale. Sorry if I'm being

308
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:47,690
dramatic. You know I'm a good detective, right? I've solved every case I've taken on,

309
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:52,730
except the mystery of how to put on a hat. I don't like hats. My head is a strange shape.

310
00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:00,570
It really is. The point is, you're safe. I'm going to find the culprit. The best thing you

311
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:07,079
can do is sit and wait. Everything will be okay. I don't feel okay. I'm finding it hard to calm

312
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:14,409
down. I understand ghosts are scary, but there might not be a ghost. You really think it's not

313
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:24,300
a ghost? I don't know for sure. Oh. Let's try a visualization exercise. What's a visualization...

314
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:32,380
Exorcism? It's a thing where we pretend. Imagine you're on a beach surrounded by calming waves.

315
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:39,269
You can feel cool breeze on your face. The waves slowly move in and then out. It's a safe beach.

316
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,320
What beach is it? This beach. This isn't a safe beach. There's a ghost here.

317
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:59,019
No, the ghost is on holiday. Oh, okay. Where is it? On a road trip. Cool. Can we visualize

318
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:07,380
that we're on a road trip instead? But the ghost is on the road trip. Great point. Continue.

319
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:14,019
Anyway, the waves are coming in and out slowly. There's nothing to worry about.

320
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:22,230
No ghosts around at all. The ghost is on a road trip? Yep. Nothing to fear. A nice sandy beach.

321
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:40,170
Just me in the ocean. How do you feel? So relaxed. Great. Me too. Thanks so much, detective.

322
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:55,130
That's okay. I want to give you something as thanks. Perhaps a piece of my crown. A chunk of pure

323
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:03,050
gold. Wow, that's so kind. It's really heavy. It better be. It's made out of pure gold, man.

324
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:25,579
Why? I like gold. Okay. Got questions for me? What? Weirdly, weird sexual voice?

325
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:31,380
What are you talking about? That's half the fucking sounds you heard on the radio.

326
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:45,860
All right, I got a pure gold. Okay, what? I got this potion. I mean, he doesn't know. Remember,

327
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:51,639
do not split up when searching for ghosts like Scooby-Doo. Who took my sunglasses? Give them back.

328
00:50:52,599 --> 00:51:06,170
That's me. I did that. Cool. Note, some fall noises need some tomatoes or soup. Who is ghost?

329
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:15,289
I'm not qualified. This might come in handy. Got a magnet. Oh, that was easy. That was really easy.

330
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:18,570
That was super easy. That was the easiest thing I've done all day. I got the magnet. Okay.

331
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:25,800
Science line, don't go in. Okay. What are you going to do? Fucking kill me?

332
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:39,530
Hmm. I should have listened to the sign. All right, we got a magnet.

333
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:52,070
We got a magnet? Okay. Always with the question. Is there anything you need to know?

334
00:51:52,710 --> 00:52:07,670
I got a magnet. I brought you a magnet. What? A real one? Are you for real? Yes. This is a

335
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:15,019
dream come true. Thank you so much. No problem. In return, I'll give you this big shell.

336
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:26,420
I don't need it anyway. Great. Thanks. Wow. A real magnet. All right. Now we take the shell

337
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:48,500
and we go over here. I think this needs a new voice. Always. Always asking questions.

338
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:57,179
Ask me questions. Just be careful. I have a big shell if you want one.

339
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:06,539
How did you do this? Somebody? How did you do that? It's a long story. Oh, in that case,

340
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:13,960
I don't care. Just give me the shell. Don't care. I hate stories, especially long ones.

341
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:23,380
Okay. Anyway, I totally want the shell. Can I swap you for the shell? Very quickly.

342
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:34,219
I have this magnifying glass. Look at the tiny shells. They're very small. I won't need it now

343
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:44,789
that I have this big shell. Cool. Thanks. You're still standing weird. I'm still on alert.

344
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:57,510
Here's the magnifying glass. Now get out of here. Wow. What a crowd. Biggest crowd anyone's ever

345
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:11,610
seen. And then we go over here. Who wanted the magnifying glass? You did. I've got something for

346
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:21,349
you. Best deal in the history of all magnifying glasses. Every magnifying glass. It's the best

347
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:30,059
deal ever. Just sometimes. Do we have a voice? Oh yeah. Questions. Questions. Questions. What else

348
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:41,190
do you want to know? I have a spare magnifying glass if you want one. Interested? Are you kidding

349
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:50,920
me? There's very little, there's nothing I want more. Here you go. This is the best day ever.

350
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:58,360
All of my dreams are coming true. We got Medicare for all. We got magnifying glasses. And remember,

351
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:08,630
I was the first one that put forth the magnifying glass bill of 1981. Best day ever. Is there

352
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:15,289
anything I can do to repay you? Do you need any help with your secret agent business? I'm not a

353
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:25,050
secret agent. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. I can give you my lunch. Oh, what you cooking? Pasta as always.

354
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:32,090
I always eat as cheap as I can. A little bit of olive oil on your pasta. That's all you need.

355
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:42,139
Some of these people put tomato sauce on their pasta. Too much. Too expensive. Pasta is all.

356
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:50,840
If there's one thing I love apart from a thrill of secrecy is pasta. Anyway, my appetite is

357
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:59,639
satiated from the deliciousness of this magnifying glass. That's a weird way to word that. Whatever.

358
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:12,090
You like my pasta or what? Yay. It's all yours. All right. What do we need? All right. We have,

359
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,690
we need one. Wait, wait, wait. Is this enough? I think we have everything. I forget. Oh yeah.

360
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:21,130
Right. It's evil. A little more evil. More questions. Ask me them. The questions I read.

361
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:26,679
What else is new? Didn't you list the ingredients for the explosive device?

362
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:36,039
Toothpaste, some wool, a chunk of pure gold, and some pasta. Ask me the questions I read.

363
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:49,780
We need wool. How do I get wool? Larry David and Bernie Sanders are the same person.

364
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:58,949
Didn't they like meet and they just kind of started going like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

365
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,110
They just like kind of were yelling at each other for like a minute or two.

366
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:11,909
I fucking love Larry David. If you've never seen Curb Your Enthusiasm,

367
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:21,139
just do, just what are you doing? Like do it. What are you doing? All right. So what, what now?

368
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:37,320
I need, oh, you got wool right here. Hey, how's it hanging? Fine. I guess bored mostly.

369
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:46,789
Why are you bored? That's suspicious. Suspicious? Why? Surely you can't just say I'm suspicious.

370
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:57,849
There's no rule against it. I'm not being suspicious at all. I guess not. Sorry for calling

371
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:05,210
you suspicious. That's okay. Why are you bored? Isn't hunting ghosts supposed to be exciting?

372
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:10,650
For the first week? Sure. Not now though. I've been at this post the entire time.

373
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:18,539
I'm shedding everywhere. Gross. I know. You mind if I ask you a few questions?

374
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:30,380
Ask away. Shitting? Why are you shitting so much? I haven't had a trim in ages. It's just so yuck.

375
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:36,300
Split ends everywhere. I'm usually getting cut once a week, but it's been two weeks now.

376
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:45,000
Yuck. It's so gross. It's totally fine. Thanks for trying to spare my feelings. There is wool

377
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:54,730
everywhere. I think everyone is so grossed out by it. Surely that's not true. Maybe not,

378
00:58:54,730 --> 00:59:03,289
but it feels true in my heart. I think most people like wool. Used for so much stuff. Like what?

379
00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:13,849
My jumper is made out of wool. Wait, are you for real? Yes. That's weird. It's weird that

380
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:20,900
you're wearing my hair. Wool is pretty gross too. That's why I keep mine short. I don't think wool

381
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:31,219
is gross at all. Okay, but what if I wore a coat made of your slime? What? Ew. Gross, right? Sure,

382
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:35,619
but slime is kind of gross anyway. And I'm not saying that as someone who is very slimy.

383
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:43,530
I am saying that. Wool is worn by most people. It's the first time I've heard someone wearing

384
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:49,380
a wool. I think that makes you the weird one. Plus, I'm pretty sure the shirt you were wearing

385
00:59:49,380 --> 01:00:02,920
is wool. Wait, wait. What? I'm wearing another sheep's hair? I'm pretty sure, yeah. Gross.

386
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:09,179
I'm happy to take your wool away from you if you'd like. I mean, your own wool is not whatever.

387
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:16,570
Oh, yes, please. You'll need something to clean it up with. Like a broom or a fire or something.

388
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:24,019
Okay, cool. I probably won't use fire. Okay. I can't believe I'm wearing wool.

389
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:30,139
What if it's Barney's? What if I ask you some more questions?

390
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:38,659
Can I ask away? Hey, I got that broom. Ready to clean?

391
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:48,199
Yeah, it's amazing. Thanks, detective. Can I keep this broom? Absolutely. Can I keep your wool?

392
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:59,000
It's still weird, but yeah, knock yourself out. What? I mean, like, take all the wool you want,

393
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:09,179
not physically knock yourself out. Are you stupid? Phew. All right, I'm ready.

394
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:33,510
Is this the Witcher? All right, here we go. Four questions. Ask me them the questions I mean,

395
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:40,469
those ones. Can you list the ingredients one more time? Toothpaste, wool,

396
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:52,420
chunk of gold, and some pasta. Thanks. Do I not have toothpaste? Wait, that doesn't count?

397
01:01:53,139 --> 01:02:06,940
That's mouthwash. Where would I get toothpaste? There's more. Wait, bug. There's a bug. Oh,

398
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:35,179
wait a minute. Holy shit. There's a small enemy spider. Howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy,

399
01:02:35,179 --> 01:02:43,829
howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy.

400
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:57,780
Yep. Right. You brought my toothpaste shipment? No, I'm the detective. Oh, okay. Can I call you

401
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:13,530
T-D-T-T-T-TEC or whatever? Yes. Nice. I have some questions. Is that okay?

402
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:23,019
Take it away, detective. Why aren't you wearing a lab coat like the other scientists?

403
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:30,170
It's my day off. I've been working so hard for the last two weeks. It's very important to take a

404
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:39,139
break and get some sun. You're right. Not about the sun, but taking day off. Yeah, I didn't

405
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:45,989
pick a great day for it. Sorry to question you on your day off. Take it away, detective.

406
01:03:49,480 --> 01:04:00,300
Well, I'll tell you something. Arthur, hope you don't mind me saying, but you have wonderful teeth.

407
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:10,260
Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'm so glad someone finally noticed. How do you keep them so pearly,

408
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:16,980
White? Which Dr. Tight Smile's 101 tooth whitening cool paste for teeth, of course.

409
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:24,329
Dr. Tight Smile's 101 tooth whitening cool paste for teeth. I get a shipment here every three days.

410
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:33,239
I go through the stuff so quickly. I'm down to my last tube. Well, where can I get some of my own

411
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:45,030
toothpaste? Do you have teeth? Well, I could give you my tube, but I would need something

412
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:50,090
else to keep my mouth fresh. I think about it. Can I ask you some of these questions?

413
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:59,179
Take it away, detective. Mouthwash. I have some mouthwash for you. Amazing. Thanks.

414
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:08,599
Am I able to use your toothpaste now? I almost forgot. Here you go, detective. Take it. Do

415
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:20,809
what you will with it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's

416
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:30,300
go. Let's go. More questions. Ask me the questions, I mean. I've slowed down a little. I'm trying to

417
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:35,340
be more like my friend over here on the other side. He's a little more toned down than me.

418
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:48,070
I'm trying to be more like him. Let's make some dynamite. Let's see. Oh, you got everything.

419
01:05:49,449 --> 01:06:03,690
Yep. Amazing. Shall we make some dynamite? Yes. Let's do it. Nice. I'll cook up some

420
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:20,329
dynamite and we can get exploding, baby. Punished Bernie. Well, this is it. Yep. Time to blow this

421
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:31,429
cave up. Larry, explosives are dangerous. Sorry. Time to carefully blow this cave up. Thank you.

422
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:39,800
No worries. I'm nervous. Me too. And I'm not even coming into the cave. You're not?

423
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:49,050
I don't like dark spaces. I'm a sunny boy, baby. I'm not a baby. Sorry. Anyway, good luck.

424
01:06:49,860 --> 01:07:06,420
Look after yourself in there. Thanks, Larry. Let's do it. That's like super animated. I'm surprised

425
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:19,210
that was like fully animated. Everyone is Bernie. Oh, let me just tell you something. Okay. Oh,

426
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:28,500
my pasta. My pasta. I got pasta here. Okay. Thanks. Everyone is Bernie. Well, that's not

427
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:50,260
true. That's not necessarily true. Oh, FPS gameplay. Every one of them is from Alabama.

428
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:55,340
That's not true. There was that one guy that was from every country on earth.

429
01:07:56,219 --> 01:08:33,979
So, I mean, that's not true. Stream will be popping. This is the bird. It's Finley. Oh, hi.

430
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:55,399
Uh, who are you? Are you a ghost? What? I don't think so. Are you sure? Hmm. Yep. That's great.

431
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:15,979
You're not wrong. So, um, who are you? Finley. Who are you? The detective. Howdy. Wait a minute.

432
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:24,729
Finley. I know that name. I'm pretty well known around here. Around local dance circles.

433
01:09:25,449 --> 01:09:31,289
Fuck. No, I can't. I can't do Irish. I can't. No, not Irish. Not Irish. Not Irish. Anybody.

434
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:36,569
Anything but Irish. Anything. You're Martin's friend. Ah, yeah. What are you? What are you

435
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:43,270
doing here? Oh, practicing for the dance competition. It's tomorrow. How long have you been down here?

436
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:50,100
Uh, geez. Like two weeks, I think. I didn't even realize.

437
01:09:53,050 --> 01:10:02,520
Wait. Two weeks? Have you seen any ghosts around? Nah. Just me down here. Does Martin know you're

438
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:09,159
here? I don't think so. He never comes down here. Really? Why not? He thinks every dark

439
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:13,000
space is haunted. Oh, he reads all those ghost books and thinks there's a ghost in every

440
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:21,289
square. It's good for me, though. Perfect spot to try. You've been dancing for two weeks, right?

441
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:30,180
All right. Yeah. Aren't you tired? I mean, I

442
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:38,699
picked naps. These mushrooms are super nutritious. Gross. Mushrooms are disgusting.

443
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:47,770
That's your opinion, detective. No, it's a fact. Okay. Okay.

444
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,920
Anyway, Martin's been super spooked out because he's been hearing weird noise down

445
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:02,699
the island. Any idea what that is? I've been listening to my radio while dancing.

446
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:11,670
Let me tell you, it has been crazy. This cave has lots of holes in it. The sound from your radio

447
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:18,920
could easily travel up to the surface. I bet it's super warped, too. You know you've been trapped in

448
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:33,909
here, right? The cave's been blocked off by rocks. Really? Really? Really? Really? Okay, here we are.

449
01:11:33,909 --> 01:11:40,229
No, yeah, right here. Right there. I think this is it right here. That's so funny. Yeah, you could

450
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:54,579
have died. Then I'd actually be a ghost. I didn't even think of that. Yeah. Anyway, let's go. Let's

451
01:11:54,579 --> 01:12:27,159
leave. Oh, look at me. Finley. Hi, Martin. Hi. What are you doing here? I was in the cave.

452
01:12:29,609 --> 01:12:42,659
What? How did you get in? It's been sealed up for weeks. Two weeks, to be exact. As it turns out,

453
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:48,789
there was never a ghost. It was Finley in the cave the whole time. She was so wrapped up in

454
01:12:48,789 --> 01:12:54,500
practicing she didn't even notice the cave got caved in. The noises from her radio powered up to

455
01:12:54,500 --> 01:13:05,130
her surface and sounds really scary. But my ghost books. I was so sure it was a ghost. No, just me.

456
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:10,920
Ghosts assure you you should never trust books. Don't ever read one. Always use the internet

457
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:25,689
instead. Yeah. Books are, without exception, actually inaccurate. Yep. Wait. Hold on. Hi,

458
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:30,149
apologies for the interruption. I hope you're enjoying the game. I won't keep you for long.

459
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:35,369
Well, I agree with the detective on most issues. There are contexts in which books can be very

460
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:39,880
useful and informative. It's important to check the validity of the author's sources

461
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,109
and to check the book is up to date. The internet can also be a useful place to find information,

462
01:13:45,109 --> 01:13:49,829
but make sure you're getting your information from a trusted site. Thank you for your time.

463
01:13:49,829 --> 01:13:59,560
Enjoy the rest of the game. So anyway, as I was saying, books have no place in society.

464
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:06,010
Sure thing. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for opening my eyes to the usefulness

465
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:21,659
of the internet and the uselessness of books. You're very welcome. The useless snake.

466
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:27,579
So just to be clear, you were practicing for the competition this whole time.

467
01:14:27,579 --> 01:14:33,260
I'm in it to win it. I'm still not entirely sure what this dance competition involves.

468
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:41,340
Dance competition. Best dancer wins. Who else is competing? That's a good point.

469
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:53,640
Just us, I guess. Don't forget Moe the Mouse. Who? One of the ghost scientists. The what?

470
01:14:53,640 --> 01:15:00,300
Don't worry about it. I think we need more entrance. I know a few hardworking friends

471
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:07,079
who could use a good boogie, but they won't be here tomorrow. Well, let's move the competition

472
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:21,800
to today. Before we dance, I just want to say thanks for solving the mystery, detective.

473
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:29,079
No problem at all. I had a lot of fun. Help. Larry figured out where the noises were coming from.

474
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:32,899
Larry? Is that the lobster? The one that talks over everybody?

475
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:40,949
Well, I give my thanks to Larry too. Shall we boogie?

476
01:15:40,949 --> 01:16:02,250
Let's go. I beat the game. Holy shit. Frog Detective's fucking got some monster moves.

477
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:16,949
He needs some space. Hey, he's just flexing on everyone. Yeah, he really is. Like everyone's

478
01:16:16,949 --> 01:16:35,689
going to get out of the way. Who has the best moves though? Let's see. What a mystery.

479
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:50,100
Tier list. Okay. I think we've practiced enough. Wait a minute. Who's judging? Wait,

480
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:57,979
this is the best part of the whole game. I'll do it. All right. We have to decide. Let's go.

481
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:17,239
All right. All right. Okay. All right. No, no, you can't pull out the robot. No.

482
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:31,460
And next. All right. I like it. All right. That's the best one so far. That's the single lady.

483
01:17:38,220 --> 01:18:02,659
That's robot two. Nope. That's all right. That shit face. That shit face guy at wedding.

484
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,819
When the wedding circle forms and everyone starts dancing and they're like, you go in,

485
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:10,899
now you go in. And everyone's like clapping along and there's some really cool shit. And then

486
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:16,260
somebody just stumbles into the middle and they're fucked. And all they can do is just move their

487
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:20,100
arms around people like, yeah, awesome. But in your head, you're going, holy fuck man. Somebody

488
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:26,819
sit down. Somebody's got to sit that guy down and give him a water. It was Larry. It was Larry.

489
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:36,579
No, no, no. There's no poll. It was that like single ladies. Yeah. Yep. I didn't, I didn't

490
01:18:36,579 --> 01:19:00,420
did no votes for that one. Sorry. This is the election. What was the plot of the game?

491
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:05,060
I don't know. I was concentrating on doing voices for 85% of it. I don't even know what we did.

492
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:10,180
We went to an island and we solved it. There was a cave that was noise was coming out of it.

493
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:27,050
I don't remember anything. Hopefully you guys can do new game plus pog. Oh, well, that's cool.

494
01:19:28,899 --> 01:19:36,680
This is the last case that we saw. Okay. Cool. I wonder what happened there. All I know is that

495
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:43,510
on this picture, there's a giant enemy crap. No, fuck that. I'm not doing that one again.

496
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:55,109
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want to keep that. Okay. When we do the community content,

497
01:19:55,109 --> 01:20:01,189
and I just know I'm continuing to perpetuate the meme of the giant enemy spider because there are

498
01:20:01,189 --> 01:20:08,970
like 10 giant enemy spider remixes tonight. So I, all right, we're going to, there's a lot of remixes

499
01:20:09,689 --> 01:20:10,250
already.

500
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:20,819
Frog detective, crime solving agency. Frog detective speaking. How can I help you? Detective

501
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:27,800
supervisor. Great work on the haunted island mystery. Thank you. I tried really hard.

502
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:34,180
I don't think even lobster cop could have solved that one. I think you're underestimating lobster

503
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:41,060
cop. You're probably right. Anyway, as I saw you busted a groove at the dance competition.

504
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:54,199
Yeah. Where'd you see that? It was on TV. Every channel, every channel in HD. Cool. I didn't even

505
01:20:54,199 --> 01:21:01,079
see any cameras. Well, you certainly impressed the public. My phone has been ringing off the hook.

506
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:08,359
Mostly the calls are about your dancing, but I did get one call about a case. Have you heard of

507
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:17,430
warlock woods? I haven't. Well, there's some very strange going on things around there.

508
01:21:18,069 --> 01:21:23,670
They need our best investigator on the job. Lobster cop was not available.

509
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:34,789
Can you handle another case detective? I can handle anything. The detective will return

510
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:44,149
in the fucking star wars episode two, the case of the invisible wizard. Oh no, that's the wrong

511
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:51,420
franchise. Captain America will return. Star Wars will return. Well, whoever wouldn't know

512
01:21:51,420 --> 01:22:06,760
star wars will return. That was cute. It's already out. It's out now. Play it. Don't play it right

513
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,239
now. No, but no, no, no, no, no. We don't have time for that. We don't have time for that. How

514
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:27,270
long is it? Yes, we do. It's another hour. It's 30 minutes. All right. All right. Let's do another

515
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,710
one. Let's do let's do frog detective chapter two. Let's go. All right. Let's do it. Yeah. All

516
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:42,020
right. Let's do it. Guys, I already I think I already own it. Do I? Case of the invisible wizard.

517
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:50,600
Done. I already got it. It takes like an hour to be. All right. Then fucking whatever. Fine.

518
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:59,659
This is cute. We got time for community. This community content is not going to be as long as

519
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:05,770
the last one. It's like half as much stuff because it's like a part two and it's catching us up to

520
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:16,119
like last week. Oh, look at that. I do. I have it already. Yeah, don't worry. This one is what's

521
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:22,090
it called? You're going to hear a loud and I'm really sorry about that. It wasn't even that loud.

522
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:31,619
Dude, hyper hype in the chat, hype in the chat, hype train. What the fuck is going on?

523
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:38,260
Hype train started. I disabled hype trains. So don't even try. They physically are turned off

524
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:59,829
on this channel. Looking for a game to capture. Found one. Found one. Frog Detective 2. I got to

525
01:23:59,829 --> 01:24:13,500
change the game, right? This is not accurate. We're in Frog Detective 2 now. The case of the

526
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:26,470
invisible wizard. This is cute. Isn't that cute? Speed run it. Can you? Can I speed run this? I

527
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:33,189
don't know. I don't want to speed run it. I want to take my time and have some fun. All right. Let's

528
01:24:33,189 --> 01:24:39,350
keep going. Here we go. Frog Detective 2. New voices. It's a new game. There's going to be new

529
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:47,109
voices. And unfortunately the voice actor from Frog Detective 1 did not move on to Frog Detective 2.

530
01:24:47,109 --> 01:24:52,010
He was in the middle of other projects. So that's the biggest gripe that I think a lot of people

531
01:24:52,010 --> 01:25:00,949
have with this one. I've heard. So hopefully that it's still, you know, hopefully people still think

532
01:25:00,949 --> 01:25:06,619
it's any good. I don't know. Let's find out. Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency. Frog Detective

533
01:25:06,619 --> 01:25:17,930
speaking. Hey detective. Hi supervisor. Why did you hang up on me? Huh? We were talking just a

534
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:26,979
moment ago about a new case. The one at Warlock Woods, right? Yeah. I hung up because I got too

535
01:25:26,979 --> 01:25:38,899
excited about solving another mystery. That's understandable. What can I, what can you tell me

536
01:25:38,899 --> 01:25:47,100
about this new case? It's a doozy detective. Hold on to your hat. Supervisor, you know I can't wear

537
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:55,560
hats. Sorry. Anyway, what, what, what, what, what the fuck do you want me to do about this?

538
01:25:56,489 --> 01:26:05,000
All right. I told you what happened. All right. You want, you want me to mute his sections and I,

539
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,720
hold on. I know that voice actor. You want me to call him and see if he'll like, he'll come

540
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:17,029
into like a discord call and like read it. Well, it costs a lot of money. I know that actor. Okay.

541
01:26:17,029 --> 01:26:24,069
All right. All right. All right. All right. Let me, let me see if they're on discord. They are.

542
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:30,090
They're online. Well, you just, just hold on. Wait until I get them in a call. A couple of days ago,

543
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:35,239
a new resident moved in. A shy kind of gal. Doesn't like to be the center of attention.

544
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:40,500
Anyway, she settles into the new house and doesn't go outside to greet anyone.

545
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:45,460
The residents of the town feel like they need to welcome her properly. So they organize a welcoming

546
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:53,699
parade. Great idea. Absolutely. But someone in the town seemed to think otherwise. Last night,

547
01:26:53,699 --> 01:27:01,859
the parade decorations were destroyed. What? I know, right? So rude. Nobody has any leads on

548
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:07,619
the case. They don't. I'm waiting for them to fucking reply to me. Jesus guys. I can't just

549
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:19,579
turn it off. I'm waiting for a reply on discord. Everybody needs to relax. Holy shit. That's where

550
01:27:19,579 --> 01:27:30,970
you. All right. Hold on. Are you fucking around now? Jesus fucking Christ. Hold on.

551
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:48,180
Hello? Hey, what's up? It's me. Oh, hey, what's going on? How are you doing? I'm doing good. Did

552
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:53,619
you get my messages that I sent you? Yes, I did. All right. Do you, are you cool with doing this?

553
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:59,880
Yeah, it's okay. All right. So I'm going to mute the frog sections and then you can come in.

554
01:28:00,699 --> 01:28:05,020
And I mean, it might be delayed a little bit. It's okay. No, that's fine with me. I'll do that.

555
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:14,140
That's fine. Cool. Real voice, by the way. Real voice, by the way. Are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready.

556
01:28:15,739 --> 01:28:34,710
Okay. Oh, oh, sorry. That's me. I'm the detective. I'm aware. Warlock Woods is a magic town. So it's

557
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:40,789
not the easiest place to get to. You'll need to take an enchanted cart to the end of the line,

558
01:28:40,789 --> 01:28:47,779
then travel the rest of the way on foot. Too easy. You'll need to question everybody to get to the

559
01:28:47,779 --> 01:29:03,619
bottom of things. Do you think you can solve the mystery? Great. Hop to it. Oh, I forgot to mention

560
01:29:03,619 --> 01:29:16,920
the new resident of the woods is special. She's invisible. Oh, that was loud. Hey, can you,

561
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:26,149
are you eating something? Yeah. Can you put, can you put just, I've got a little lot of people

562
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:46,149
here watching. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Oh, that was loud. And a wizard, an invisible wizard. Cool. Um,

563
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:51,029
what's the relevance of her being invisible? Nobody knows what she looks like. So they're

564
01:29:51,029 --> 01:29:56,579
really excited to find out. That's the parade and the decorations and the celebrations.

565
01:29:56,579 --> 01:30:10,119
They want her to be un-visible? De-invisibled? Uh, uh, visible. Exactly. Anyway, how do you

566
01:30:10,119 --> 01:30:16,340
have everything you need? Um, I have my shoes, my jumper, my pants. I think I'm missing something.

567
01:30:16,979 --> 01:30:23,850
Your magnifying glass? Of course. It's on the table next to the die. Why did I say diaper?

568
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:30,310
I was gonna say diaper. Yeah, you're not very good at reading. What the fuck am I,

569
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:39,739
how was that, why was I going to say diaper? Unprofessional. Shut the fuck up,

570
01:30:39,819 --> 01:31:02,970
dickhead. That's very rude to say. Am I getting paid for this by the way? Thanks supervisor.

571
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:22,300
Good luck detective. Ah, my trusty magnifying glass. I can't solve mysteries without it.

572
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:41,159
What, he's calling me now? He's calling me, you're calling me now? Should I answer it? Hello? I'm

573
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:46,600
sorry. Okay. It's all right. Yes, I'll, I'll pay you by the way. I didn't mean to fly off the handle

574
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:57,300
like that. I'll turn it back down. Same thing, same deal. Okay. Let's go. Ah, my trustworthy

575
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:02,739
magnifying glass. I can't solve mysteries without it. Well, maybe I could, but I wouldn't want to.

576
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:16,039
It's missing background white noise from his mic. No, no, don't give me that idea. Please.

577
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:25,220
Fuck. God damn it. Hold on. That's fucking stupid enough for me to think it's funny. Just wait.

578
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:45,850
He has push to talk on. Yeah, but hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me one second. This

579
01:32:45,850 --> 01:34:00,069
is worth, this is worth it to me. Bear it back. Okay. I just had to, uh, need to just fix his mic.

580
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:11,430
Something's wrong with his mic. Sorry. There we go. Look through your magnifier with right click.

581
01:34:11,989 --> 01:34:36,260
Yes, yes, yes. We know how to do this. Let's go. Are you ready? Lobster cop. Uh oh.

582
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:58,890
It was a wink. Is it Larry? No, it's not Larry. Ah, it's the famous frog detective.

583
01:35:06,489 --> 01:35:14,500
Perhaps not, but I'm sure you will be soon. I hope so. What brings you to my office detective?

584
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:26,810
It's actually next door, right here. Oh, I thought that was a cupboard. Oh, that's my office.

585
01:35:28,119 --> 01:35:35,500
I've been putting all my cleaning supplies in there. Yes, I'm looking every time you do it.

586
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:42,760
They even say, this is my office. And then you say, sure, this is your cleaning frog.

587
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,890
And then I say, I'm a crime-solving frog, not a cleaning frog.

588
01:35:57,050 --> 01:36:00,250
Excuse my ignorance detective. I wasn't trying to offend.

589
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:06,250
Make him louder. Turn him up. It's, can you talk for me for a second?

590
01:36:09,819 --> 01:36:18,060
That's not, it needs to be a little louder. You're too quiet. Let me turn you up a little.

591
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:27,670
Say something. Is that better? A little bit, say it again. How's that? Is that sound better?

592
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:34,170
No, it turns, your mic is fucked up. You don't have any, hold on, wait, wait, wait,

593
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:39,369
check to see what mic you have plugged in. I think I have this one plugged. I think I'm on,

594
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:47,210
it says, larger tech webcam microphone 920. No, no, no, no, no, wrong mic. You have a better mic,

595
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:54,010
don't you? No, I don't. You don't have a better mic. Aren't you a voice actor?

596
01:36:59,369 --> 01:37:03,449
You don't have, you don't have a single. Let me try plugging this one in. Do you think this one's

597
01:37:03,449 --> 01:37:16,899
better? Hello? Is that better? Does that sound better on this one? Or should you go back to the

598
01:37:16,899 --> 01:37:24,149
other one? No, go back to the other one. The other one, other one, other one. That's a little better.

599
01:37:29,369 --> 01:37:39,100
Why do you sound so different on this one? You're on, you're on Skype on the phone.

600
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:45,979
All right, fuck it, whatever. We gotta, we, I mean, we can't just do this all day.

601
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:50,939
This is, that's fine. So I'm going to put you, I'll just put you, I'll pump the phone through.

602
01:37:50,939 --> 01:38:02,710
That's fine. You know, you want to just come over? Just come over, just come over. Like I'll do my

603
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:10,500
best impression of you as best as I fucking can. Two hours? Two, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now,

604
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:19,770
like right now. Get here now. I don't have a car. Just drive here now. I'll do my best. Okay.

605
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:27,180
I'll be here in two hours. Be here in fucking 10 minutes. I'm getting another phone call.

606
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:44,260
What the fuck is calling me now? What? Stop, hold on. Stop, stop. Hello? Oh, Jeremy. I'm so glad I

607
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:49,619
got to get a hold of you. It's me, Bill Blueberry. I heard you were looking for some voice work.

608
01:38:49,619 --> 01:39:00,600
You're looking for some voice actors. I can do voice work. Okay. You'll be here. I gotta hold

609
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,279
the phone with my mouth. Are you, are you going to, how, when, when do you think you'll be here?

610
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:10,460
Is he gone? All right, he's gone. Fucking Blueberry calling me. Doesn't he? I hate this shit.

611
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:16,119
People know I'm fucking streaming. So aggravating. Like why would you call me during the middle of

612
01:39:16,119 --> 01:39:23,880
the stream to like try to get on the stream? Like get the fuck out of here, dude. Anyways,

613
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:33,460
I'll do my best. Excuse my ignorance, detective. I wasn't trying to offend. I'm a very busy boy,

614
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:38,500
a head full of mysteries. Sometimes I forget to be polite. If I was polite all the time,

615
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:42,659
I would never have time to soften it. Hold on. I can do better than that. That's a better,

616
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:47,619
better voice, right? I got a better voice than that, don't I? He's just like, oh, look at me.

617
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:53,979
I understand. Maybe that's why I'm not as talented as you, lobster cop.

618
01:39:55,340 --> 01:40:01,420
Perhaps, but detective, you must keep trying. Never give up. I can give you some tips if you'd

619
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:11,159
like. Wow. Yes, please. Tip number one. Pay attention. You should make sure you are looking

620
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:21,130
at things and paying attention to words. Yes, quite right. Tip number two. Everyone is a suspect.

621
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:32,149
Even you. I will suspect myself much more from now on. Good call. Good call. Tip number three.

622
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:39,619
Carry a notebook. Oh, I'm not really big on books. They are without exception factually inaccurate.

623
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:46,060
Detective, don't be foolish. A book you write yourself cannot be factually inaccurate if you

624
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:56,380
are writing facts. I suppose you're right. I don't have a notebook though. Well, it's your

625
01:40:56,380 --> 01:41:01,659
lucky day. I have a spare notebook on my desk. You can decorate it and use it all you like.

626
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:09,340
Wow, really? Yep. There are stickers you can use too. I bought them all with my crime solving money.

627
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:16,819
Cool. I'll let you get to it, detective. Head into my office when you're ready to decorate.

628
01:41:16,819 --> 01:41:22,739
Okay. Thanks, lobster cop. Thanks. Thanks, lobster cop. It's fucking hard to do.

629
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:37,340
I hope he gets here soon. We can decorate the office? Oh, stickers. Which stickers should I

630
01:41:37,340 --> 01:43:15,210
pick? And where should they go? Oh, this is tough. This is tough. Oh, schmock. That's good.

631
01:43:21,079 --> 01:43:35,369
No. Wait, this is kind of off. Worm dick. All right. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

632
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:48,789
Sorry. Sorry for the worm dick. Done. Done. Clap for me. Clap for me. Clap for me. I fucking

633
01:43:48,789 --> 01:43:56,550
demand it. Clap for me. I fucking demand it. Clap for me. I fucking demand it. I got a notebook.

634
01:43:56,550 --> 01:44:13,449
Open it. Oh, there's a new mechanic. Notebook. Magnifier. Invisible wizard. That's a lot of pages.

635
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:19,899
Notes. Number one best detective has lots of fans. It's super cool. So many trophies. I hope I get

636
01:44:19,899 --> 01:44:47,609
a trophy one day. You don't have any trophies. Liar. There's no chairs in here. It's okay.

637
01:44:50,489 --> 01:44:55,670
You can stand right there. Right in front of the mic. Right here? That's a little too close. Hold

638
01:44:55,670 --> 01:45:01,100
back. Okay. Is this ready? Good. All right. I'll get you some. You can sit down right there. That's

639
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:10,409
fine. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. You know what to do. You know what to do, man of the hour.

640
01:45:11,479 --> 01:45:21,239
Say it. Say the line. You came just in time. It's time to solve it. Oh. Are you all right?

641
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:29,579
Are you okay? My leg. That was my leg. I know. You all right? No, you're fine. You're fine. You

642
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:36,819
okay? Yeah, I'm okay. This was slippery. Why is it so wet? Because I sweat a lot.

643
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:50,420
Okay. It's time to solve another mystery. Did it. Does this look swollen? Yeah.

644
01:45:51,619 --> 01:46:21,560
Really swollen. Oh, shit. Super hot. What? Are you good? I am 100% fine. Nobody worried about me.

645
01:46:22,279 --> 01:46:29,399
It's not swollen. I just had a full job of peanut butter in my pocket and it slid down to the bottom

646
01:46:29,399 --> 01:46:40,439
of my pants because I have a hole in my pants. Oh, okay. You're good. Snacking on the go.

647
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:55,670
You're making it worse. New characters. Hold on. We got new characters. He didn't shit his pants.

648
01:46:56,869 --> 01:47:26,779
Does Jerma Wink even work? What the fuck? It didn't go through? What a scam. Warlock Woods.

649
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:49,529
Oh, my stars. It's you. It's me. The famous lobster cop. I really thought you'd be a lobster.

650
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:59,180
I know I'm frog. Yeah. Why is your name lobster cop? I have to tell you something.

651
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:11,350
I'm not lobster cop. Why not? I don't know how to answer that. Who are you? I'm the detective.

652
01:48:12,649 --> 01:48:23,300
Frog detective. I see. Is lobster cop not available? Unfortunately, not. Well, I think you'll do just

653
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:33,579
fine. Thanks. I'm Susan. Hi, Susan. I'm the one that contacted the agency,

654
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:40,380
which I think you'll find excludes me from being a suspect. Oh, I didn't know that would work.

655
01:48:41,399 --> 01:48:50,149
You should know these things, detective. I'm sorry. It's okay. I think you should still question me,

656
01:48:50,149 --> 01:49:00,699
though. Getting into Eeyore territory, but remove all doubt. Okay. Question me all you like.

657
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:08,819
Oh, the wizard. You got a balloon here. Do you know the wizard? I'm sorry. I spoke up before you

658
01:49:08,819 --> 01:49:15,930
did. Do you know the wizard personally? Nobody knows her personally. Well, not here at least.

659
01:49:17,819 --> 01:49:24,409
Not me. Right. But I had a lot to do with the organization of the parade.

660
01:49:25,369 --> 01:49:32,010
And I was the one to start the investigation. You mentioned that. Worth bringing up again.

661
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:41,989
So you were fine with her moving to town? Absolutely. That old house has been empty

662
01:49:41,989 --> 01:49:47,979
for years and it's really nice. Someone wants to live there. He's a lot of fixing up, but I'll

663
01:49:47,979 --> 01:49:58,520
look nice soon. I think plus it's always exciting to have a new neighbor. Sure is. I put up a sign

664
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:04,760
I made for the wizard, but it got knocked down last night. Feeling pretty sad about it. If I'm

665
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:11,739
honest, I know you're here to solve the mystery, but I just need to tell someone how I feel.

666
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:19,350
You can talk to me about it. Thanks. I'm not a professional sign maker, but I worked really hard

667
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:26,020
on that sign. Really. I struggled to understand why someone would knock it down. It feels so

668
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:31,779
heartless. And now I'm not sure who to trust. I thought everyone here would be thrilled to have

669
01:50:31,779 --> 01:50:38,060
a new neighbor. It's a tricky situation for sure. Some people are protective of their communities

670
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:43,720
and think new people are going to change things for the worse, but that's almost never the case.

671
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:48,970
New people make places better because they bring new perspectives, especially in small communities.

672
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:53,939
Hopefully it's just misunderstanding or a mistake. I'd like to believe people are good.

673
01:50:53,939 --> 01:51:03,619
That being said, I'm treating everyone as a suspect. Not me, right? Even you, especially you.

674
01:51:03,619 --> 01:51:12,100
Especially me? Oh, I know. Sorry. Not sure why I said that, but you're not off the hook just yet.

675
01:51:12,739 --> 01:51:19,609
That's it. Detective, could you please find me a hook? I could hang the sign back up with it.

676
01:51:19,609 --> 01:51:28,340
Oh, okay. I'll do my best. Question me all you like. Okay, I need a hook. Small,

677
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:36,739
fucking enemy. It's wider. Square. All right, Susan. Motive. Maybe she didn't like her sign

678
01:51:36,739 --> 01:51:43,350
destroyed at the parade out of embarrassment. Something to fix the sign. It says she's not as

679
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:48,140
suspicious. This makes her much more suspicious. Upset about the parade being destroyed. Worked

680
01:51:48,140 --> 01:52:07,100
really hard on her sign. What do you sound like? What do you sound like? What do you sound like?

681
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:18,550
What do you sound like? What do you sound like? Hello, little frog. I'm Ralph. Why are you yelling?

682
01:52:19,689 --> 01:52:27,100
I'm just making sure you can hear me. I can hear you. You don't have to yell. You're very

683
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:35,140
small. Might be difficult for you to hear. I'm small, but I'm also very close to you. Being

684
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:43,739
small isn't the same as being far away. Are you sure? You can hear me at this volume? Yes.

685
01:52:44,810 --> 01:52:56,180
Weird. I'm the detective. I'm here to solve mystery. Really? Yes. But you're so small.

686
01:52:57,819 --> 01:53:08,840
I'm of average frog height. Can I ask you some questions about case? Questioning me, huh? What

687
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:19,300
happened to your eye? May I ask why you have an eye patch on? That's Ralph's business. Oh, it'd be

688
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:24,149
really good for me to know why you have an eye patch. Sometimes a boy just wants to wear an eye

689
01:53:24,149 --> 01:53:35,939
patch. That shouldn't make me a suspicious. You put it on for fashion. Kind of. Detective,

690
01:53:35,939 --> 01:53:42,649
I don't want to get into this too much, but I watched a movie last night about pirates,

691
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:51,640
and I loved it. And there's another three left. Three whole movies. Can you believe it?

692
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:58,329
Sequels? I've never heard of a movie having a sequel before. A giant enemy. I know, right?

693
01:53:58,329 --> 01:54:05,770
Usually sequels are reserved for video games. Yes, it's extremely normal to have a video game

694
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:12,920
sequel. Especially for games with large audiences like the Toad Investigation Series. Yeah. Anyway,

695
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:17,210
I was watching a pirate movie last night. That's where I was. And for that reason,

696
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:25,180
I have decided to wear an eye patch. Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks. Questioning me,

697
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:33,770
what about the wizard? I can't wait till there's a wizard so I can do a fucking wizard voice.

698
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:38,789
You know how that is every time. How do you feel about the wizard moving in?

699
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:48,119
It's nothing against the wizard, but I've been living away. I've been living with my friend

700
01:54:48,119 --> 01:54:58,899
Carlos for a while now, and our space is big. I would really like my own home. I'd been eyeing

701
01:54:58,899 --> 01:55:06,890
off that old house for ages, but maybe I'd move in one day. But the wizard, not there first.

702
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:14,569
I see. It's my fault, I guess. I shouldn't hold it against the wizard. Hmm. This house is twice

703
01:55:14,569 --> 01:55:20,710
as big as all the other houses. Maybe you could renovate it and turn it into two houses. You could

704
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:27,699
split it down the middle, or have one house upstairs and one house downstairs, like an apartment.

705
01:55:27,699 --> 01:55:34,069
That's a pretty cool idea. I like Carlos and everything, but I'm a private boy.

706
01:55:34,069 --> 01:55:38,630
I understand. I don't have any renovation supplies, though.

707
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:44,899
I'll see if I can track some down for you. Thanks for your help, detective.

708
01:55:44,899 --> 01:55:55,000
Maybe if I do a good job, I'll get my own building, sure. I'm excited to see it.

709
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:05,420
Dude, three houses. Two houses stacked on top of three houses? A motive in true pirate fashion

710
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:12,979
wanted to cause a ruckus, needs building supplies, loves pirates, eye patches cosmetic only,

711
01:56:12,979 --> 01:56:17,300
a private boy, wants to renovate, thinks I am too small. I am not.

712
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:25,369
Why don't you get it out of your system now while you have a minute. Nice.

713
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:53,210
Hmm. What? Huh? Who are you? The detective. Oh, I thought Lobster Cop was coming.

714
01:56:53,210 --> 01:57:04,949
Huh? What? Did you say something about Lobster Cop? No. But I heard- Can this frog read my mind?

715
01:57:04,949 --> 01:57:16,789
Why are you speaking like that? Like what? Like this? Whoa! Is that what telepathy is?

716
01:57:16,789 --> 01:57:22,840
Can you hear this frog? You're saying everything out loud.

717
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:28,810
Wow, this frog has a temper. Anyway, who are you?

718
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:33,590
I'm Noddy. Okay.

719
01:57:33,590 --> 01:57:42,840
I'm the mayor of Warlock Woods. Okay. Did you ask me to come?

720
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:49,420
No. I would have asked for Lobster Cop instead. I really need to emphasize I can hear you.

721
01:57:49,420 --> 01:57:55,590
Stop listening to me. Okay. Can I ask you some questions about taste?

722
01:57:55,590 --> 01:58:02,630
I guess so. Tell me what you want to know. How do I change your voice to something that's

723
01:58:02,630 --> 01:58:09,270
not as awful? Well, okay. I'll take that as a- I'll take that criticism.

724
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:15,460
Can you tell me about last night? Nothing.

725
01:58:15,460 --> 01:58:19,479
Oh. But I can tell you about the wizard.

726
01:58:19,479 --> 01:58:22,710
I know basically everything there is to know about her.

727
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:28,180
That's great. First of all, she's a wizard.

728
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:33,800
Uh-huh. And she- get this. She's invisible.

729
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:44,470
Great. And she just moved in. And now we're going- and- and she's a wizard.

730
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:48,869
We're gonna take the wizard and we're gonna- they're taking over all of our- all of-

731
01:58:48,869 --> 01:58:53,500
they're 1% wizards. Fucking back to Bernie.

732
01:58:53,500 --> 01:59:01,430
I think you mentioned that. No, I don't think I did.

733
01:59:01,430 --> 01:59:07,300
He only has one voice. It's- it's just different spectrums of Bernie.

734
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,939
It's like this. It's like this. It's like this. It's like this.

735
01:59:09,939 --> 01:59:14,579
This is like this. It's like this. Everybody has to sound like Bernie Sanders.

736
01:59:14,579 --> 01:59:18,659
All of us. Doesn't matter what we do. Doesn't matter how close we can be to each other.

737
01:59:18,659 --> 01:59:27,859
We're always gonna be Bernie. Right, okay. Sorry.

738
01:59:27,859 --> 01:59:32,340
It's fine. Anyway, tell me what you want to know.

739
01:59:33,659 --> 01:59:38,619
That's a real voice. That's real. That's two hours straight of doing this.

740
01:59:38,619 --> 01:59:43,930
That's- that was what that was. About the wizard.

741
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:50,250
How do you feel about the wizard coming to live here?

742
01:59:50,970 --> 01:59:56,890
Oh, heck, how do I answer this? Well, I'm happy she's here,

743
01:59:56,890 --> 02:00:02,010
but that house has been empty for ages. And I don't- didn't know she was coming,

744
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:05,770
all right? Nobody told me, you see. Not Bernie.

745
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:09,930
Look, I- oh my god, it's not Bernie. Do I- okay, do I sound like Bernie right now?

746
02:00:09,930 --> 02:00:12,779
Do I sound like Bernie right now? I want to tell you something about-

747
02:00:12,779 --> 02:00:16,470
I want to talk about this. Do I sound like Bernie Sanders?

748
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:20,890
No, I don't. My- my regular speaking voice has nothing to do with it.

749
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:30,630
When I talk normally, I go from sentence to sentence and everything is perfectly normal,

750
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:36,069
as you understand, as you hear now. I have absolutely nothing in common

751
02:00:36,069 --> 02:00:40,739
with the way that he talks or the way that he enunciates words, okay?

752
02:00:40,739 --> 02:00:46,340
God damn it. I think so.

753
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:50,020
She kind of came- wrong. He's doing it on purpose.

754
02:00:51,779 --> 02:00:59,050
She kind of came at me at a weird time of night, and I- well, I thought that she was a ghost.

755
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:06,680
Oh, yeah, it was a bit messy. Oh, I tried to vacuum her up.

756
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:13,380
Hmm, with a vacuum. I put it on the highest setting.

757
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:18,100
Just really went to town with the vacuum. I think I really freaked her out,

758
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:24,550
and now she won't come out of the house. Um, please don't put me in jail.

759
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:26,630
You're not going to jail. Jail isn't real.

760
02:01:31,029 --> 02:01:34,699
But you prob- you should probably apologize.

761
02:01:34,699 --> 02:01:38,699
Okay, sorry, detective. I mean to the wizard.

762
02:01:38,699 --> 02:01:43,420
Right, yeah. That's why I was helping with the parade, to apologize.

763
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:48,630
But she hasn't been out of the house. Also, the parade is ruined.

764
02:01:48,630 --> 02:01:51,850
I see. This makes me sound really bad.

765
02:01:51,850 --> 02:01:54,380
I swear I wanted the parade to be lovely.

766
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:57,579
As the mayor of the town, I booked a live band to play a song.

767
02:01:57,579 --> 02:02:00,729
But as you can see, the stage is gross and ruined now.

768
02:02:00,729 --> 02:02:03,930
The band is on their way, and I have no time to fix it.

769
02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:07,289
They're a very famous band. I want to be as professional as possible.

770
02:02:07,289 --> 02:02:19,350
Offer the voice actor a beer. You want a beer?

771
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:22,439
No. I- I offered him a beer.

772
02:02:22,439 --> 02:02:29,880
What the fuck are you- Well, if only I had a rug or something to use, I could cover up the mess.

773
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:33,420
But the town is in disarray. I don't have time to track one down.

774
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:37,350
Oh, no. Thank you for your concern.

775
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:40,300
If you happen to find anything that would work, please let me know.

776
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:42,920
Will do. Do you have any more questions?

777
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:49,640
Hmm. Now, we need a rug. We need a rug. We need to fix the sign.

778
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:56,810
We need building supplies. He's not a drunk like some people.

779
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:59,239
But is that- is that- is that a shot at me?

780
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:08,300
What are you talking about? I haven't had- I haven't had a drink of alcohol in, like, two weeks.

781
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:13,939
What are you talking about? I drink alcohol, like, once every two months.

782
02:03:14,939 --> 02:03:17,930
Maybe. He's sloshed.

783
02:03:18,649 --> 02:03:19,930
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

784
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:31,020
Hey. Hey. Hey. Okay.

785
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:37,180
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

786
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:38,539
Hi. Hi.

787
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:47,640
A customer.

788
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:51,739
Welcome to the Carlos All Things You Can Need shop.

789
02:03:51,739 --> 02:03:53,510
Are you Carlos?

790
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:56,390
Yes. Just like the name of the shop. That's me.

791
02:03:58,140 --> 02:04:03,399
How cool is that? The shop has my name on it.

792
02:04:03,399 --> 02:04:06,970
So cool. My company also has my name on it.

793
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:09,380
What's your company called?

794
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:13,109
Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.

795
02:04:13,109 --> 02:04:15,859
What's your name? Crime?

796
02:04:15,859 --> 02:04:20,090
Oh, no. I'm the Frog Detective.

797
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:22,890
That's not really a name, though. More of a title.

798
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:26,149
Oh, I suppose you're right.

799
02:04:26,149 --> 02:04:28,470
My shop actually has my name in it.

800
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:32,310
Cool. I'm jealous.

801
02:04:32,310 --> 02:04:39,029
Thanks. Here in Warlock Woods, we are all our own biggest fans.

802
02:04:39,029 --> 02:04:44,439
Being conceded is a societal construct. We have rejected it.

803
02:04:44,439 --> 02:04:51,100
Hence why my shop is so popular. I sell portraits, among other things.

804
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:53,000
Wow. That's great.

805
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,619
My office neighbor, Lobster Cop, has a picture of himself right above his desk.

806
02:04:58,619 --> 02:05:05,800
You know Lobster Cop? Holy heck. I've been a fan forever.

807
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:11,020
You know, he solved the mystery of the Haunted Island recently.

808
02:05:11,020 --> 02:05:17,180
I don't think so. It was actually me that did that. That was me.

809
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:22,539
Wait, really? It was all over TV. The dance competition had a lobster in it.

810
02:05:22,539 --> 02:05:25,350
Oh, you must be thinking of Larry.

811
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:31,510
You mean Small Larry? No, this was a regular-sized lobster.

812
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:35,560
Uh, no. Larry's regular-sized lobster.

813
02:05:36,710 --> 02:05:38,310
About the Larry I know.

814
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:42,680
Oh, well. Agree to disagree.

815
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:45,159
I really did solve that mystery. It was me, detective.

816
02:05:47,189 --> 02:05:50,010
That's really cool.

817
02:05:50,010 --> 02:05:51,539
Thanks.

818
02:05:51,539 --> 02:05:56,329
So you're like the second best detective, I suppose?

819
02:05:56,329 --> 02:06:01,500
Yeah. Did somebody just put a germ of Pluto with a bloody nose?

820
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:04,310
Oh, no, no. What?

821
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:06,810
Yeah. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?

822
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:08,899
Okay. What would you like to know?

823
02:06:08,899 --> 02:06:11,739
Fucking Bernie. What do you need?

824
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:18,020
All right, it's over. I gotta stop the read now, normally.

825
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:19,300
You can go home now.

826
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,020
Are you sure?

827
02:06:20,020 --> 02:06:21,380
Yeah. Get out of here. Get out of here,

828
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:26,630
because I can't pretend to be three, five, eight people anymore.

829
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:27,510
I'm staying.

830
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:30,020
Okay, you can stay.

831
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:31,300
Just here in my shop.

832
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:33,560
What about when you're closed up?

833
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:38,949
My shop doesn't close. My shop doesn't close.

834
02:06:38,949 --> 02:06:44,220
It's 24 hours. What time do you close?

835
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:45,899
Oh, fucking, I'm doing it again.

836
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:51,020
What if somebody's a portrait of themselves at 4 a.m.?

837
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:52,460
You're open all the time?

838
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:58,539
Of course. I sleep and eat and look after myself.

839
02:06:58,539 --> 02:07:03,699
My customers simply wake me if they need to buy something.

840
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:05,109
Where do you sleep?

841
02:07:05,109 --> 02:07:08,420
I sleep standing up. Here's the training.

842
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:12,310
I'm the most committed shopkeeper at all of Warlock Woods.

843
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:14,789
Also, the only shopkeeper at all of Warlock Woods.

844
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:18,100
I'm the only one, Froggy.

845
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:19,689
Do you ever take breaks?

846
02:07:20,819 --> 02:07:22,899
Sometimes, but I really like it here in my shop.

847
02:07:22,899 --> 02:07:25,180
It's where I feel most at home.

848
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:29,399
The extreme shopkeeper lifestyle isn't for everyone,

849
02:07:29,399 --> 02:07:32,119
but I take so much joy from my work.

850
02:07:32,119 --> 02:07:35,579
Me too. Although, I must request that you look after yourself

851
02:07:35,579 --> 02:07:38,779
and close the shop if you need a break.

852
02:07:38,779 --> 02:07:41,100
Okay, I promise.

853
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:44,170
Anyway, did you say anything last night?

854
02:07:44,170 --> 02:07:50,890
Nothing particularly interesting. Why?

855
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:51,770
She cried.

856
02:07:58,149 --> 02:08:01,739
I think I need to question you a bit more.

857
02:08:01,739 --> 02:08:03,779
Go for it.

858
02:08:03,779 --> 02:08:05,460
What would you like to know?

859
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:07,300
Why do they always pause and go like, huh?

860
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:08,100
What do you want, huh?

861
02:08:08,659 --> 02:08:09,779
Hi? Hey?

862
02:08:09,779 --> 02:08:18,600
Frog voice actor.

863
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:20,359
Is he okay? Are you okay?

864
02:08:25,739 --> 02:08:29,510
He swallowed an almond. He's all right.

865
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:35,640
What do you know about the new wizard that just moved in?

866
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:38,489
Who?

867
02:08:38,489 --> 02:08:42,310
The invisible wizard that moved in literally next door.

868
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:45,539
Wait, really? Somebody moved in?

869
02:08:45,539 --> 02:08:46,020
Yeah.

870
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:48,680
That place has been empty for ages.

871
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:50,579
I got to say hi.

872
02:08:50,579 --> 02:08:53,500
Oh, the parade was meant to be for saying hi.

873
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:55,319
Get him some water.

874
02:08:55,319 --> 02:09:00,939
He needs a parade? Parade?

875
02:09:00,939 --> 02:09:03,800
The parade that everyone has been prepping for.

876
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:06,119
Oh, he's been working so hard. He needs a water.

877
02:09:06,119 --> 02:09:11,699
He's been working so hard. He needs a water, doesn't he?

878
02:09:11,699 --> 02:09:15,930
Get this guy a water.

879
02:09:15,930 --> 02:09:19,750
Do you want a water or do you want a beer?

880
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:22,119
I want a beer.

881
02:09:22,119 --> 02:09:23,239
God. Beer.

882
02:09:23,239 --> 02:09:29,239
Oh, how nice. Can't wait.

883
02:09:29,239 --> 02:09:32,220
It was destroyed last night.

884
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:32,859
What?

885
02:09:32,859 --> 02:09:36,970
This conversation is a roller coaster of information.

886
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:39,979
I have literally no idea what's happening.

887
02:09:39,979 --> 02:09:41,500
You weren't involved in the decoration.

888
02:09:44,619 --> 02:09:46,619
You okay? You gonna be all right?

889
02:09:46,619 --> 02:09:48,729
Yes, I'm fine.

890
02:09:48,729 --> 02:09:51,989
You weren't involved in the decoration at all?

891
02:09:51,989 --> 02:09:56,779
Nope. Should I offer to help now?

892
02:09:56,779 --> 02:10:01,239
Wait, who is he? He needs a break.

893
02:10:11,109 --> 02:10:13,750
He's like, what did you do before you came over here?

894
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:15,989
What did you eat? Like, you ate a bunch of shellfish?

895
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:18,939
Are you like allergic to something?

896
02:10:18,939 --> 02:10:19,899
Jesus Christ.

897
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:24,920
He's not...

898
02:10:26,199 --> 02:10:26,680
He's not...

899
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:27,159
He's...

900
02:10:27,159 --> 02:10:27,880
No, he's not.

901
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:28,359
He's...

902
02:10:28,359 --> 02:10:29,079
He's...

903
02:10:29,079 --> 02:10:29,720
How old are you?

904
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:30,199
All right.

905
02:10:30,199 --> 02:10:30,520
All right.

906
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:31,159
Let's go.

907
02:10:31,159 --> 02:10:31,640
Let's go.

908
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,119
Let's go.

909
02:10:32,119 --> 02:10:32,920
Let's go.

910
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:34,760
No, it's for the invisible wizard.

911
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,119
She just moved it next door.

912
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:40,489
People saying he's not old enough to work.

913
02:10:41,210 --> 02:10:42,890
Yes, he's like 38.

914
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,819
Why am I asking an imaginary person

915
02:10:49,619 --> 02:10:52,340
if they're old enough to be working for me?

916
02:10:53,739 --> 02:10:55,020
So, I'm done.

917
02:10:56,489 --> 02:10:57,369
Oh, dear.

918
02:10:57,369 --> 02:11:00,039
The party hats.

919
02:11:00,039 --> 02:11:00,760
Pardon?

920
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:07,340
Every time we throw a parade, everyone has a party hat.

921
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:09,100
Mine was ruined at the last parade.

922
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:11,939
He is real. I know.

923
02:11:11,939 --> 02:11:15,670
I've been too busy working at my shop to buy a new one.

924
02:11:15,670 --> 02:11:16,920
Oh, no.

925
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:17,880
How embarrassing.

926
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:19,960
I can't show up to the parade without one.

927
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:22,520
Do you think it's too late to order one online?

928
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:25,079
It'll be tight.

929
02:11:25,079 --> 02:11:25,640
You're right.

930
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:27,689
Oh, what should I do?

931
02:11:27,689 --> 02:11:28,810
Don't stress.

932
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:31,050
I'll track one down for you before the parade starts.

933
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:39,220
Oh, my fucking stomach.

934
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:40,579
Oh, this is fucking...

935
02:11:40,579 --> 02:11:41,380
This is killing me.

936
02:11:43,449 --> 02:11:45,050
Everyone's going to point it out now.

937
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:46,489
Oh, my gosh. Thank you, detective.

938
02:11:46,489 --> 02:11:48,649
In the meantime, I'll figure out a way to repay you.

939
02:11:48,649 --> 02:11:52,710
Unfortunately, I don't have any frog portraits just yet.

940
02:11:52,710 --> 02:11:54,710
Not a problem.

941
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:56,380
What would you like to know?

942
02:11:56,380 --> 02:11:57,100
That's all.

943
02:11:57,100 --> 02:12:10,949
Can you please check on their leg?

944
02:12:10,949 --> 02:12:12,789
Is it still swollen?

945
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:15,609
Oh, my god.

946
02:12:19,109 --> 02:12:28,470
This is so fucked up.

947
02:12:28,470 --> 02:12:30,869
Okay, we have two or three more characters to introduce.

948
02:12:33,029 --> 02:12:36,149
And they're all going to have normal ass voices, by the way.

949
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:37,989
Ahem.

950
02:12:37,989 --> 02:12:40,020
You're the detective, right?

951
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:40,739
I'm Mandy.

952
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:42,020
Hi, Mandy.

953
02:12:42,659 --> 02:12:44,359
Be careful where you step, detective.

954
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,520
There is mess everywhere.

955
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,039
I'm used to mess.

956
02:12:49,029 --> 02:12:50,310
Lucky you, I'm not.

957
02:12:50,869 --> 02:12:52,569
My shoes are brand new.

958
02:12:52,569 --> 02:12:53,689
I can't get them dirty.

959
02:12:54,329 --> 02:12:56,250
Why don't you change shoes?

960
02:12:56,250 --> 02:13:00,020
Detective, are you joking?

961
02:13:00,579 --> 02:13:04,819
I can't wear flats with this look.

962
02:13:04,819 --> 02:13:06,979
Proportions would be all wrong.

963
02:13:07,699 --> 02:13:09,880
Besides, these shoes are enchanted.

964
02:13:10,869 --> 02:13:11,670
Oh.

965
02:13:11,670 --> 02:13:15,720
I'm one of the few actual witches here in Warlock Woods.

966
02:13:16,279 --> 02:13:18,520
Most folks here are just fans of the spooky.

967
02:13:19,079 --> 02:13:24,170
Which is fine and all, but it means a lot of the cleaning work will be mine to do.

968
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:28,300
I never should have learned that tidying up spell.

969
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:30,460
It shouldn't take too long for me to clean up this mess,

970
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:32,460
but first I need to find all my pies.

971
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:35,430
I haven't seen pies.

972
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:36,789
Same thing that happened everywhere.

973
02:13:36,789 --> 02:13:39,109
Someone thought it'd be funny to knock them all over.

974
02:13:39,109 --> 02:13:40,439
Vandals.

975
02:13:40,439 --> 02:13:41,899
So annoying.

976
02:13:41,899 --> 02:13:44,579
I spent ages making them.

977
02:13:44,579 --> 02:13:47,289
Oh, I see.

978
02:13:47,289 --> 02:13:50,579
Well, do you mind if I ask you some questions?

979
02:13:50,579 --> 02:13:54,789
Tell me what you want to know about your pies.

980
02:13:54,789 --> 02:13:58,199
Do you need help finding your pies?

981
02:13:59,260 --> 02:13:59,979
Yes.

982
02:13:59,979 --> 02:14:01,420
Detective, seriously.

983
02:14:01,420 --> 02:14:03,500
I seriously need help.

984
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:04,460
Straight up.

985
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:06,359
I can't see anything right now.

986
02:14:06,359 --> 02:14:09,750
These glasses are so dark it's unreal.

987
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:13,819
I'm such a dingus.

988
02:14:13,819 --> 02:14:18,300
I'm such a dingus.

989
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:19,100
Holy fuck.

990
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:21,380
It's nice.

991
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:21,939
Nice.

992
02:14:22,579 --> 02:14:23,539
That's a cool...

993
02:14:23,539 --> 02:14:30,090
Nobody says that.

994
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:36,119
This town is literally cloaked in eternal night.

995
02:14:36,119 --> 02:14:38,260
I do.

996
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:39,500
No, you don't.

997
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:39,899
I do.

998
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:41,909
That's my thing.

999
02:14:41,909 --> 02:14:42,869
No, that's my thing.

1000
02:14:42,869 --> 02:14:44,630
Don't stop talking about other people that say that.

1001
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:45,109
That's my thing.

1002
02:14:45,109 --> 02:14:46,390
It's a German 985 channel thing.

1003
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:46,949
It's my thing.

1004
02:14:48,149 --> 02:14:49,270
Let's talk about the people that do that.

1005
02:14:49,270 --> 02:14:51,399
It's my thing.

1006
02:14:51,399 --> 02:14:52,520
Oh, this person does it too.

1007
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:53,640
No, it's my thing.

1008
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:55,579
They can't do it.

1009
02:14:55,579 --> 02:14:58,149
Why do I think sunglasses would be a good idea?

1010
02:14:58,149 --> 02:15:00,020
They weren't a good idea.

1011
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:02,140
However, I don't regret it.

1012
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:03,859
They make me look amazing.

1013
02:15:03,859 --> 02:15:06,819
Do you think I look amazing?

1014
02:15:06,819 --> 02:15:08,460
Thanks, I do too.

1015
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:10,539
Worst purchase I've ever made in terms of practicality,

1016
02:15:10,539 --> 02:15:12,140
but it brings this look to a new level.

1017
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:15,220
I may be a dingus,

1018
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:17,220
but I'm very stylish dingus.

1019
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:23,289
What were you talking about?

1020
02:15:23,289 --> 02:15:24,550
My outfit.

1021
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:25,029
No, no, no.

1022
02:15:25,029 --> 02:15:27,289
Before that.

1023
02:15:27,289 --> 02:15:28,729
Pies.

1024
02:15:28,729 --> 02:15:28,970
Right.

1025
02:15:28,970 --> 02:15:30,810
You offered to help pick up my pies.

1026
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:33,050
I'm missing quite a few.

1027
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:34,779
If you could bring them to me,

1028
02:15:34,779 --> 02:15:36,859
I'd be happy to clean them up all up

1029
02:15:36,859 --> 02:15:38,300
and give you one as payment.

1030
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:38,859
Pie.

1031
02:15:38,859 --> 02:15:42,619
Okay, so sounds like fun.

1032
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:43,579
Neat.

1033
02:15:43,579 --> 02:15:44,380
Thanks, detective.

1034
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:45,659
Tell me what you want to know.

1035
02:15:45,659 --> 02:15:49,340
I need a pie.

1036
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:49,659
All right.

1037
02:15:49,659 --> 02:15:55,930
So we're going to put another circle here.

1038
02:15:55,930 --> 02:15:59,609
Mandy needs help finding her five pies.

1039
02:15:59,609 --> 02:16:01,130
Okay, we can just run around and find them, right?

1040
02:16:01,130 --> 02:16:05,770
I'm going to knock them over.

1041
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:07,210
Schooled me about fashion, fair enough.

1042
02:16:07,210 --> 02:16:08,810
Real.

1043
02:16:08,810 --> 02:16:10,090
Ask her about the wisdom.

1044
02:16:10,170 --> 02:16:14,069
All right.

1045
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:19,189
Oh, can I?

1046
02:16:19,189 --> 02:16:21,050
Where were you last night?

1047
02:16:21,050 --> 02:16:23,130
Doing heaps of pushups and getting ripped.

1048
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:23,930
Just kidding.

1049
02:16:23,930 --> 02:16:27,859
I was on wizbay.net where magic happens, TM.

1050
02:16:27,859 --> 02:16:29,510
How are you doing?

1051
02:16:29,510 --> 02:16:31,590
Bidding on some new shoes.

1052
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:34,340
Oh, you just got those ones?

1053
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:35,540
Yeah, but the ones I was bidding on

1054
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:39,610
would go super well with this blue dress I have.

1055
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:40,569
Wow, cool.

1056
02:16:40,569 --> 02:16:41,770
I know.

1057
02:16:41,770 --> 02:16:43,299
I didn't win though.

1058
02:16:43,299 --> 02:16:45,940
Who got shoes?

1059
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:46,340
Not sure.

1060
02:16:46,340 --> 02:16:47,940
All I know is their screen name.

1061
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:52,069
Someone called DizzyWizzy109.

1062
02:16:52,069 --> 02:16:52,950
Sorry to hear it.

1063
02:16:52,950 --> 02:16:55,799
How did you feel when you lost?

1064
02:16:55,799 --> 02:16:58,549
A bit defeated.

1065
02:16:58,549 --> 02:17:00,709
I went for a midnight stroll to cool off,

1066
02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:03,670
but then I saw someone in the distance.

1067
02:17:03,670 --> 02:17:07,110
It was a pretty, it was a pretty froggy night,

1068
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:08,149
so I couldn't see much,

1069
02:17:08,149 --> 02:17:10,469
but they were carrying a large box.

1070
02:17:10,469 --> 02:17:12,629
I couldn't see what they looked like,

1071
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:14,920
but they definitely weren't from here.

1072
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:16,680
It felt like they were waiting for someone.

1073
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:19,180
I didn't think too much of it and went home.

1074
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:24,709
Did you hear any noise after that?

1075
02:17:24,709 --> 02:17:26,700
No, my house is soundproof.

1076
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:28,219
Ever since Mary has taken up singing,

1077
02:17:28,219 --> 02:17:29,819
it's kind of a necessity around here.

1078
02:17:29,819 --> 02:17:32,500
I only saw the mess in the morning.

1079
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:33,219
Interesting.

1080
02:17:33,219 --> 02:17:35,540
Tell me what you want to know.

1081
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:39,340
Fucking easy.

1082
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:44,950
This is gonna be fucking easy.

1083
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:49,340
Oh, look, DizzyWizzy109 is in chat.

1084
02:17:49,340 --> 02:17:49,979
Nice.

1085
02:17:49,979 --> 02:17:51,579
All right, we're gonna find somebody

1086
02:17:51,579 --> 02:17:52,459
with that screen name.

1087
02:17:52,459 --> 02:18:00,010
Is this the last person?

1088
02:18:00,010 --> 02:18:00,969
This is it, right?

1089
02:18:00,969 --> 02:18:05,530
Where's the, all right, what do we got here?

1090
02:18:06,469 --> 02:18:11,909
Let me like take, ooh, lost pie.

1091
02:18:11,909 --> 02:18:14,069
I got a lost pie.

1092
02:18:14,069 --> 02:18:15,459
Nice.

1093
02:18:15,459 --> 02:18:20,540
I need five of these?

1094
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:22,299
I have not absorbed a single piece of information

1095
02:18:22,299 --> 02:18:23,420
this game has ever put forth.

1096
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:25,579
I know, and that's my fault,

1097
02:18:25,579 --> 02:18:28,139
because I've just been fucking all this up

1098
02:18:28,139 --> 02:18:28,940
with voices and stuff,

1099
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:29,979
and you can't even pay attention.

1100
02:18:29,979 --> 02:18:31,020
I'm sorry about that.

1101
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:31,979
I have no idea what's going on.

1102
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:35,100
This is the only task I remembered.

1103
02:18:39,129 --> 02:18:39,690
Two pies.

1104
02:18:40,329 --> 02:18:46,149
Oh.

1105
02:18:46,149 --> 02:18:47,350
Hey, Reindeer.

1106
02:18:48,309 --> 02:18:49,430
Hey, Reindeer.

1107
02:18:50,549 --> 02:18:51,110
Reindeer.

1108
02:18:55,959 --> 02:18:56,459
Hi.

1109
02:18:57,239 --> 02:18:58,360
Hello.

1110
02:18:59,159 --> 02:18:59,959
Wanna hop in?

1111
02:19:01,979 --> 02:19:02,620
A little bit.

1112
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:05,350
But I'm on a case.

1113
02:19:06,069 --> 02:19:07,209
Oh, cool.

1114
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:08,649
I'm Victor.

1115
02:19:08,649 --> 02:19:09,129
Who are you?

1116
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:11,319
The detective.

1117
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:13,659
Is that your real name?

1118
02:19:15,319 --> 02:19:15,719
Maybe.

1119
02:19:17,129 --> 02:19:18,170
Cool, cool, cool.

1120
02:19:18,170 --> 02:19:19,290
Are you here to question me

1121
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:20,090
and investigate stuff?

1122
02:19:20,649 --> 02:19:22,090
Because, like, I'm not suspicious.

1123
02:19:22,729 --> 02:19:25,639
How do you know you're not suspicious?

1124
02:19:28,659 --> 02:19:31,420
Well, I think I didn't do it.

1125
02:19:33,319 --> 02:19:33,819
You think?

1126
02:19:35,020 --> 02:19:35,979
Yeah, nobody knows anything

1127
02:19:35,979 --> 02:19:37,020
for certain these days.

1128
02:19:42,459 --> 02:19:44,760
So why are you here swimming?

1129
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:46,360
I'm visiting my friend Naughty.

1130
02:19:48,379 --> 02:19:50,040
Oh.

1131
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:52,280
She's the only person I know with a hot tub.

1132
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:53,879
She's the only person I know with a hot tub.

1133
02:19:53,879 --> 02:19:56,840
Do you remember the fucking voice from last one?

1134
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:59,500
Well, I heard they were gonna be delicious pies

1135
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:00,139
for the parade,

1136
02:20:00,139 --> 02:20:01,100
and the timing was perfect.

1137
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:09,209
YouTuber Jim Carrey.

1138
02:20:09,209 --> 02:20:11,450
Now, just because I opened it up with, like,

1139
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:12,250
Hello!

1140
02:20:13,450 --> 02:20:14,090
Do not!

1141
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:16,250
That was Jim Carrey.

1142
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:16,569
It was.

1143
02:20:16,569 --> 02:20:16,729
All right.

1144
02:20:16,729 --> 02:20:17,770
But just because I did that doesn't mean

1145
02:20:17,770 --> 02:20:19,049
the character is Jim Carrey.

1146
02:20:19,049 --> 02:20:24,889
Where do you live normally?

1147
02:20:24,889 --> 02:20:27,260
Over near Pumpkinville.

1148
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:27,819
Nice spot.

1149
02:20:27,819 --> 02:20:29,100
I was thinking of taking a holiday there

1150
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:29,899
at some point.

1151
02:20:29,899 --> 02:20:32,329
Yeah, it's fine.

1152
02:20:32,329 --> 02:20:37,430
Yeah.

1153
02:20:37,430 --> 02:20:40,760
Um, so, can I ask you a question about anything?

1154
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:41,719
Yeah, whatever.

1155
02:20:41,719 --> 02:20:44,280
Otto3, questions.

1156
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:44,889
All right.

1157
02:20:44,889 --> 02:20:45,690
What'd you do last night?

1158
02:20:45,690 --> 02:20:46,569
Do you need anything?

1159
02:20:46,569 --> 02:20:52,620
Where were you when the parade was destroyed?

1160
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:54,579
Well, I had been swimming all day

1161
02:20:54,579 --> 02:20:55,940
in Naughty's hot tub,

1162
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:57,299
so I was super wrinkly.

1163
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,860
Yep.

1164
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:02,020
And it was hard for me to get inside the house

1165
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:04,489
because of my wrinkly hooves.

1166
02:21:04,489 --> 02:21:06,090
Uh-huh.

1167
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:08,409
So I waited for about a half an hour

1168
02:21:08,409 --> 02:21:11,450
for the wrinkles to de-wrinkle.

1169
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:12,780
Yep.

1170
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:14,700
And then I went inside to Naughty's house

1171
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:18,549
and snoozed on the couch all night.

1172
02:21:18,549 --> 02:21:20,520
What time was that?

1173
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:21,940
All night.

1174
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:24,549
No, I mean, what time?

1175
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:27,639
That is not the time.

1176
02:21:27,639 --> 02:21:28,680
What time do you close?

1177
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:30,840
What time do you get back into the house?

1178
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:32,309
I gotta stop doing that.

1179
02:21:32,309 --> 02:21:33,110
I gotta stop fucking...

1180
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:37,860
I can't do No Country for All Men every half day.

1181
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:39,379
Before the parade was destroyed,

1182
02:21:39,379 --> 02:21:40,340
it wasn't me.

1183
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:45,139
Probably wasn't me, I mean.

1184
02:21:45,139 --> 02:21:46,100
Can't be sure.

1185
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:50,729
But 90% probability that it wasn't me.

1186
02:21:50,729 --> 02:21:51,770
Questions, you have them.

1187
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:59,159
Stop talking in voices.

1188
02:21:59,159 --> 02:22:00,360
For fuck's sake.

1189
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:02,100
Stop talking in voices.

1190
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:02,899
For fuck's sake.

1191
02:22:10,409 --> 02:22:10,969
One guy.

1192
02:22:12,329 --> 02:22:18,459
Did you know about the invisible wizard

1193
02:22:18,459 --> 02:22:19,020
before you get...

1194
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:27,559
What if I started going, even why?

1195
02:22:27,559 --> 02:22:28,120
Not really.

1196
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:29,159
I knew the parade was for her,

1197
02:22:29,159 --> 02:22:31,989
but beyond that, I know a lot.

1198
02:22:31,989 --> 02:22:36,219
I'm begging you, do that.

1199
02:22:36,219 --> 02:22:37,340
Talk in tongues.

1200
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:44,219
Just going nuts.

1201
02:22:45,909 --> 02:22:47,190
I think a lot more people would leave

1202
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:50,579
if I did that one.

1203
02:22:50,579 --> 02:22:51,860
Annoying that they never threw a parade

1204
02:22:51,860 --> 02:22:54,969
for me coming to visit.

1205
02:22:54,969 --> 02:22:56,250
I'm super cool.

1206
02:22:56,250 --> 02:22:59,379
Have you been here before?

1207
02:22:59,379 --> 02:23:00,260
So many times.

1208
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:05,399
The first time they even threw me a parade.

1209
02:23:05,399 --> 02:23:06,620
Okay.

1210
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:08,219
I take the parade thing back.

1211
02:23:08,219 --> 02:23:11,739
Just pretend I didn't say that.

1212
02:23:11,739 --> 02:23:12,219
Sure.

1213
02:23:12,219 --> 02:23:15,299
Detective, I'm really bored of this conversation.

1214
02:23:15,299 --> 02:23:16,500
I'm sorry if that's rude,

1215
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:18,500
but I have a new policy of being honest with people.

1216
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:22,149
Were you dishonest before?

1217
02:23:22,149 --> 02:23:23,110
Yeah, I guess.

1218
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:26,729
I wouldn't tell people when they were boring me.

1219
02:23:26,729 --> 02:23:28,569
I don't think that counts as dishonesty.

1220
02:23:28,569 --> 02:23:31,260
What am I supposed to do when people are boring?

1221
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:32,180
I don't know.

1222
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:32,819
Leave the stream.

1223
02:23:34,409 --> 02:23:35,690
Find somebody else to watch.

1224
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:41,899
But probably don't tell them.

1225
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:44,940
It would hurt their feelings.

1226
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:50,860
I didn't hurt your feelings though, did I?

1227
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:55,020
Well, I have to admit I was a bit hurt.

1228
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:57,020
I have a very exciting job and I'm a frog.

1229
02:23:57,020 --> 02:24:01,420
I like to solve mysteries.

1230
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:03,100
I don't think I'm boring at all.

1231
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:07,899
Well, Jerma was hired to voice act this entire game.

1232
02:24:07,899 --> 02:24:08,860
Yeah, dude.

1233
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:10,360
Yeah.

1234
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:12,680
I'm full of energy today, if you couldn't tell.

1235
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:16,819
This game sucks.

1236
02:24:16,819 --> 02:24:20,860
All right, actually ban that person for five minutes.

1237
02:24:20,860 --> 02:24:22,540
I want them to sit there and think about it.

1238
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:23,020
It should be like...

1239
02:24:25,670 --> 02:24:31,579
And then they can talk again.

1240
02:24:31,579 --> 02:24:33,260
Plus, I've solved my fair share of crimes.

1241
02:24:33,819 --> 02:24:34,940
What crimes?

1242
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:35,420
This one.

1243
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:40,149
You've solved the crime already?

1244
02:24:41,079 --> 02:24:43,190
Yeah, Ralph did it.

1245
02:24:43,190 --> 02:24:43,829
How do you know?

1246
02:24:47,620 --> 02:24:48,819
Good point.

1247
02:24:48,819 --> 02:24:50,760
I haven't decided that bit yet.

1248
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:52,440
But it seems likely that he did.

1249
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:54,200
What was his motive?

1250
02:24:55,159 --> 02:24:55,639
His what?

1251
02:24:57,319 --> 02:25:00,360
Motive, the reason for destroying something.

1252
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:06,620
Oh, I think it's because he has an iPad on.

1253
02:25:06,620 --> 02:25:07,739
This is a great stream.

1254
02:25:07,739 --> 02:25:09,260
You guys are smoking crack.

1255
02:25:09,739 --> 02:25:17,420
You guys are smoking crack.

1256
02:25:28,819 --> 02:25:30,020
You guys are smoking.

1257
02:25:31,370 --> 02:25:32,489
Don't smoke crack.

1258
02:25:32,489 --> 02:25:33,450
That's not good for you.

1259
02:25:34,170 --> 02:25:37,780
I don't think that's a motive.

1260
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:38,819
That doesn't make any sense.

1261
02:25:39,620 --> 02:25:40,739
Wow, who's the rude one?

1262
02:25:41,299 --> 02:25:42,020
This conversation...

1263
02:25:42,739 --> 02:25:43,459
I'm just...

1264
02:25:43,459 --> 02:25:43,860
Let's go.

1265
02:25:44,739 --> 02:25:45,299
I just...

1266
02:25:45,299 --> 02:25:51,239
We're just sitting here going back and forth saying the same three sentences.

1267
02:25:51,239 --> 02:25:51,959
I mean it.

1268
02:25:51,959 --> 02:25:53,719
I just get so grumpy when I'm hungry.

1269
02:25:53,719 --> 02:25:56,200
Why don't you eat something and get out of the hot tub?

1270
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:56,920
No, I just...

1271
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:58,440
I must continue to soak.

1272
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
You could ask someone to get you something to eat.

1273
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,250
Like who?

1274
02:26:02,250 --> 02:26:04,659
There is nobody here.

1275
02:26:04,659 --> 02:26:05,219
I am here.

1276
02:26:05,219 --> 02:26:06,659
I have to get him something to eat.

1277
02:26:06,659 --> 02:26:07,299
Right there.

1278
02:26:07,299 --> 02:26:08,659
I go being rude again.

1279
02:26:08,659 --> 02:26:11,909
If you happen to find food, I would love to have some.

1280
02:26:11,909 --> 02:26:14,469
In the meantime, I would like to apologize for being so rude.

1281
02:26:14,469 --> 02:26:18,629
Please take one money as an apology.

1282
02:26:18,629 --> 02:26:19,190
Nice.

1283
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:26,340
Wait, give item?

1284
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:27,690
Lost?

1285
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:32,709
Should I give him a pie?

1286
02:26:32,709 --> 02:26:33,030
Is this...

1287
02:26:33,829 --> 02:26:35,030
Should I not give him a pie?

1288
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:40,059
No, no, no, no.

1289
02:26:40,059 --> 02:26:42,059
No, he doesn't deserve it.

1290
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:44,340
He doesn't deserve it.

1291
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:47,219
No, it's not.

1292
02:26:47,219 --> 02:26:48,260
It's not your pie.

1293
02:26:51,190 --> 02:26:53,110
Am I going to give this pie back that was on the ground

1294
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:54,629
and then this person is going to sell it for money

1295
02:26:54,629 --> 02:26:56,229
and the person is going to eat something that was on the ground?

1296
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:00,149
Very rude.

1297
02:27:03,399 --> 02:27:04,760
Rude because of hunger.

1298
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:06,440
Maybe just rude in general doesn't live here.

1299
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:10,629
Okay.

1300
02:27:10,629 --> 02:27:11,829
Smoke and crack.

1301
02:27:12,549 --> 02:27:15,959
All right, we got...

1302
02:27:15,959 --> 02:27:17,239
How many pies do we need?

1303
02:27:17,239 --> 02:27:17,799
We need five.

1304
02:27:17,799 --> 02:27:18,280
What do I have?

1305
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:18,520
Two?

1306
02:27:19,159 --> 02:27:20,680
How much does this stuff cost in the store?

1307
02:27:21,479 --> 02:27:22,120
That's too expensive.

1308
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:23,319
How am I going to ever afford this stuff?

1309
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:26,229
Six dollars for a sheep?

1310
02:27:27,030 --> 02:27:29,989
Hello, wizard.

1311
02:27:30,549 --> 02:27:31,799
All right, I haven't talked to you.

1312
02:27:54,090 --> 02:27:55,770
Hello?

1313
02:27:57,159 --> 02:27:59,559
Hello, frog.

1314
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:01,559
That was there.

1315
02:28:01,559 --> 02:28:02,840
That was a fucking softball.

1316
02:28:03,479 --> 02:28:05,829
Hello.

1317
02:28:05,829 --> 02:28:06,549
What's your name?

1318
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:08,219
I'm Mary.

1319
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:09,579
Nice to meet...

1320
02:28:09,579 --> 02:28:10,139
Same person.

1321
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:11,500
Nice to meet you.

1322
02:28:12,649 --> 02:28:13,129
You too.

1323
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:14,649
Did you like my song?

1324
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:16,569
Yep.

1325
02:28:16,569 --> 02:28:20,040
I've been practicing all day and all night.

1326
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:20,840
Oh, are you okay?

1327
02:28:21,559 --> 02:28:24,600
He's getting embarrassed from this.

1328
02:28:31,270 --> 02:28:34,440
Turn on mic distortion for one of these.

1329
02:28:37,079 --> 02:28:37,879
All right, fine.

1330
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:47,659
Okay, okay, okay.

1331
02:28:48,379 --> 02:28:49,340
I guess it's...

1332
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:50,379
How's this one sound?

1333
02:28:50,940 --> 02:28:52,459
This is a pretty good sounding one.

1334
02:28:53,739 --> 02:28:54,540
Not a bad one.

1335
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,659
Okay.

1336
02:28:58,489 --> 02:28:59,370
I'm tired.

1337
02:29:01,860 --> 02:29:03,059
Maybe you should get some sleep.

1338
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:05,750
Maybe.

1339
02:29:07,239 --> 02:29:08,520
You sing very loudly.

1340
02:29:11,020 --> 02:29:13,579
I'm why everyone's soundproof their houses.

1341
02:29:15,290 --> 02:29:16,329
That sounds expensive.

1342
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:21,219
Yeah, but that's not really my problem.

1343
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:24,819
I think I sound very good even late at night.

1344
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:27,180
How late?

1345
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:33,510
I love to sing at 3 a.m.

1346
02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:34,149
Wow.

1347
02:29:34,149 --> 02:29:37,299
That's when my energy is the highest.

1348
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:40,120
That doesn't sound very healthy.

1349
02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:43,030
My health is my business.

1350
02:29:44,219 --> 02:29:45,100
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1351
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:46,840
Sorry.

1352
02:29:48,549 --> 02:29:49,190
That's okay.

1353
02:29:50,219 --> 02:29:52,940
Maybe I should listen to some soft sounds before bed.

1354
02:29:53,579 --> 02:29:58,200
Welcome to my hair salon.

1355
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:03,000
That will be 100 money.

1356
02:30:06,059 --> 02:30:06,780
Just joking.

1357
02:30:07,719 --> 02:30:09,000
Anyway, who are you?

1358
02:30:10,250 --> 02:30:10,969
I'm the detective.

1359
02:30:11,979 --> 02:30:12,860
Oh, cool.

1360
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:13,899
Can you question me?

1361
02:30:15,799 --> 02:30:16,680
Do you mind if I ask?

1362
02:30:17,239 --> 02:30:17,959
Oh, yeah, sure.

1363
02:30:18,889 --> 02:30:19,370
Oh, boy.

1364
02:30:19,370 --> 02:30:20,649
I love questions.

1365
02:30:20,649 --> 02:30:26,940
What do you know about the wizard that moved in?

1366
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:27,500
Wrong voice.

1367
02:30:32,729 --> 02:30:33,049
Yeah.

1368
02:30:34,659 --> 02:30:35,379
Oh, sorry.

1369
02:30:35,379 --> 02:30:36,579
I didn't actually hear you.

1370
02:30:38,170 --> 02:30:39,530
I was asking about the wizard.

1371
02:30:40,579 --> 02:30:43,020
Oh, yeah, there's a wizard.

1372
02:30:43,659 --> 02:30:44,700
She just moved in.

1373
02:30:45,899 --> 02:30:47,459
Why?

1374
02:30:47,459 --> 02:30:48,340
I'm a detective.

1375
02:30:49,139 --> 02:30:49,540
Right.

1376
02:30:50,260 --> 02:30:51,780
This is part of the questioning, right?

1377
02:30:52,729 --> 02:30:52,969
Yes.

1378
02:30:54,549 --> 02:30:55,030
Cool.

1379
02:30:55,030 --> 02:30:55,350
Cool.

1380
02:30:56,149 --> 02:30:58,629
So I didn't do any crimes or anything.

1381
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:02,459
And I have the right to remain silent.

1382
02:31:02,459 --> 02:31:02,700
Yeah.

1383
02:31:02,700 --> 02:31:04,219
But did you want to remain silent?

1384
02:31:07,129 --> 02:31:09,180
Literally never.

1385
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:14,809
So like, I heard that Ralph was super weird about the new wizard moving in.

1386
02:31:14,809 --> 02:31:19,530
Also, I heard that Mandy was in a bad mood the night the parade was destroyed.

1387
02:31:23,930 --> 02:31:29,370
And I heard that Naughty, like, attacked the wizard one time.

1388
02:31:30,739 --> 02:31:33,459
And that's all, actually.

1389
02:31:33,459 --> 02:31:37,930
Does this make me a snitch?

1390
02:31:37,930 --> 02:31:39,659
I think so.

1391
02:31:39,659 --> 02:31:40,139
Rats.

1392
02:31:41,450 --> 02:31:43,129
Oh, boy, I love questions.

1393
02:31:43,850 --> 02:31:50,579
What were you doing when the parade was destroyed?

1394
02:31:52,229 --> 02:31:54,149
Oh, boy, yeah.

1395
02:31:55,399 --> 02:31:59,690
Sucks that the parade was destroyed.

1396
02:31:59,690 --> 02:32:02,409
Oh, we're doing questioning.

1397
02:32:02,409 --> 02:32:03,670
What was I doing?

1398
02:32:04,229 --> 02:32:05,270
Not much.

1399
02:32:05,270 --> 02:32:06,950
Just singing outside.

1400
02:32:06,950 --> 02:32:13,620
You were outside when the parade was destroyed?

1401
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:15,940
Yeah.

1402
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:16,899
Did you see anything?

1403
02:32:18,409 --> 02:32:18,729
Yeah.

1404
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:20,809
What did you see?

1405
02:32:21,370 --> 02:32:27,690
Detective, have you heard of extortion?

1406
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:28,010
Yes.

1407
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:30,649
That's great news.

1408
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:33,399
Is it?

1409
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:39,260
Detective, I would like to extort you.

1410
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:42,340
I don't think that's legal.

1411
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:47,110
I am above the law.

1412
02:32:48,899 --> 02:32:53,979
Oh, why are you extorting me?

1413
02:32:53,979 --> 02:33:00,950
I would like five money for a train ticket.

1414
02:33:00,950 --> 02:33:04,500
I don't have any money.

1415
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:06,979
Well, you best get some soon.

1416
02:33:08,629 --> 02:33:09,909
It was her.

1417
02:33:09,909 --> 02:33:11,110
It was her.

1418
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:11,750
It was her.

1419
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:12,549
She did it.

1420
02:33:12,549 --> 02:33:17,129
What do you need a train ticket for?

1421
02:33:17,129 --> 02:33:18,250
He's getting bored.

1422
02:33:18,250 --> 02:33:21,370
No, just shh.

1423
02:33:21,370 --> 02:33:27,139
I want to go to Froggy.

1424
02:33:29,579 --> 02:33:30,860
I just broke this shit.

1425
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:33,340
I'm sorry.

1426
02:33:34,299 --> 02:33:35,899
This is actually the knob.

1427
02:33:35,899 --> 02:33:36,780
The knob slipped.

1428
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:43,110
I want to go to Froggy Wood and become a star.

1429
02:33:43,989 --> 02:33:46,280
Oh, that sounds exciting.

1430
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:47,399
I know, right?

1431
02:33:47,479 --> 02:33:51,000
Sorry about the extortion thing, but I don't really have many other ways to get there.

1432
02:33:51,879 --> 02:33:54,840
I figure if you get the money from me, I can finally go and live my dreams.

1433
02:33:58,020 --> 02:33:58,899
Do I have to do this?

1434
02:34:06,469 --> 02:34:07,659
I'm not doing that.

1435
02:34:07,659 --> 02:34:09,690
What will you give me in exchange?

1436
02:34:16,540 --> 02:34:17,180
He's getting bored.

1437
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:17,500
Fuck.

1438
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:17,819
Hold on.

1439
02:34:18,629 --> 02:34:19,430
I'm not getting bored.

1440
02:34:22,340 --> 02:34:23,379
What kind of information?

1441
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:24,920
A phone number.

1442
02:34:25,819 --> 02:34:26,940
Who am I calling?

1443
02:34:26,940 --> 02:34:28,059
I can't tell you that.

1444
02:34:28,059 --> 02:34:31,579
All I can say is that they were in the vicinity when the parade was destroyed.

1445
02:34:31,579 --> 02:34:33,899
I don't think you'll be able to solve the case without this phone number.

1446
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:36,360
Hence the extortion.

1447
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:37,239
Sorry.

1448
02:34:37,239 --> 02:34:38,549
It's okay.

1449
02:34:38,549 --> 02:34:40,229
We all get extorted every now and then.

1450
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:43,030
Yeah.

1451
02:34:44,489 --> 02:34:48,010
Anyway, come back to me when you have my money.

1452
02:34:48,969 --> 02:34:50,969
Oh boy, I love questions.

1453
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:55,479
Five dollars?

1454
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:58,360
Do Robo Bernie.

1455
02:34:58,360 --> 02:34:59,079
Oh my god.

1456
02:34:59,719 --> 02:35:06,260
Perhaps the wizard is a better singer than her.

1457
02:35:09,139 --> 02:35:09,540
Bernie.

1458
02:35:11,059 --> 02:35:11,700
Bernie.

1459
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:12,739
Robo Bernie.

1460
02:35:12,739 --> 02:35:13,379
I can't.

1461
02:35:15,219 --> 02:35:17,620
I can't have this be three hours of Bernie Sanders.

1462
02:35:18,579 --> 02:35:19,940
With like sprinkling.

1463
02:35:19,940 --> 02:35:23,860
Sprinkle in like a baby voice and like Donald Trump and then some Obama.

1464
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:25,379
Like I can't have three hours.

1465
02:35:25,379 --> 02:35:26,819
I can't have three hours of Bernie.

1466
02:35:26,819 --> 02:35:27,540
We can't do that.

1467
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:30,149
All right.

1468
02:35:30,149 --> 02:35:31,190
I need to buy those pies.

1469
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:41,209
What about the corn chips?

1470
02:35:41,209 --> 02:35:41,690
Whatever they are.

1471
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:43,500
Should I pick these up?

1472
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:44,379
Oh, there's a pie.

1473
02:35:49,079 --> 02:35:50,760
Four hours of Dean Dingus.

1474
02:35:51,399 --> 02:35:54,090
Finally some good fucking food.

1475
02:35:58,899 --> 02:36:00,020
God damn it, man.

1476
02:36:03,299 --> 02:36:03,540
All right.

1477
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:04,020
What have we got?

1478
02:36:04,579 --> 02:36:05,700
I need two more pies.

1479
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:06,260
What was that?

1480
02:36:08,760 --> 02:36:09,319
You see that?

1481
02:36:09,879 --> 02:36:15,860
I can't go in it.

1482
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:16,899
Wait, I can go in the houses?

1483
02:36:18,780 --> 02:36:19,739
Hello, is anyone home?

1484
02:36:20,819 --> 02:36:23,139
Sounds like somebody's inside, but I shouldn't intrude on.

1485
02:36:23,139 --> 02:36:24,180
I'll come back another time.

1486
02:36:26,409 --> 02:36:27,450
Hurry up and investigate.

1487
02:36:27,450 --> 02:36:28,489
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

1488
02:36:35,340 --> 02:36:36,139
You're a detective.

1489
02:36:37,989 --> 02:36:39,909
Yeah, and I'm I'm detectiving.

1490
02:36:39,909 --> 02:36:40,709
What do you think I'm doing?

1491
02:36:45,020 --> 02:36:45,659
This is the wizard.

1492
02:36:45,659 --> 02:36:46,219
Yeah, I know.

1493
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:52,739
I need two more pies.

1494
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:55,639
I have no idea where they are.

1495
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:01,100
Wow, wow, wowie, wowie, wowie.

1496
02:37:01,100 --> 02:37:01,340
What?

1497
02:37:07,579 --> 02:37:08,700
Look, idiot.

1498
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:09,420
Look, idiot.

1499
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:10,059
Look, idiot.

1500
02:37:10,059 --> 02:37:12,620
Look, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.

1501
02:37:15,559 --> 02:37:16,200
Look, idiot.

1502
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:17,159
He's stupid.

1503
02:37:17,159 --> 02:37:18,600
Look, he's stupid.

1504
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:19,719
Look, he's stupid.

1505
02:37:26,229 --> 02:37:27,270
In the water?

1506
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:30,139
There's nothing in the water.

1507
02:37:30,139 --> 02:37:34,790
There's nothing in the water.

1508
02:37:35,350 --> 02:37:49,670
Found one.

1509
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:51,979
It's a lost pie.

1510
02:37:51,979 --> 02:37:52,540
I need one more.

1511
02:37:53,100 --> 02:37:54,700
There's a huge deer in the water.

1512
02:37:54,700 --> 02:37:56,219
I can see the deer in the water.

1513
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:00,600
Yeah, I know.

1514
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:01,559
That's a little strange.

1515
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:06,280
One more pie and then we can do a turn in.

1516
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:09,319
Can I take the balloon?

1517
02:38:12,709 --> 02:38:13,350
Got it.

1518
02:38:13,350 --> 02:38:15,110
And go.

1519
02:38:15,110 --> 02:38:18,040
All right, let's do the turn in.

1520
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:23,989
Five lost pies.

1521
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:29,750
Streams like this are why I need a therapist.

1522
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:31,510
What?

1523
02:38:32,229 --> 02:38:38,840
All right, what do you want?

1524
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:40,629
Uh, here are your pies.

1525
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:42,709
All five of them.

1526
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:45,399
Well, all of them?

1527
02:38:45,959 --> 02:38:46,520
I think so.

1528
02:38:47,239 --> 02:38:48,360
Yeah, that looks like all of them.

1529
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:50,520
Wow, you must have searched far and wide.

1530
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:52,440
Yes.

1531
02:38:53,479 --> 02:38:54,680
Wowie, thanks, detective.

1532
02:38:55,850 --> 02:38:57,450
Show this stream to the doctor.

1533
02:38:58,170 --> 02:39:02,329
You mean you're going to show this stream to your doctor

1534
02:39:03,049 --> 02:39:04,889
and say something's wrong with me.

1535
02:39:04,889 --> 02:39:06,010
I got something wrong with me here.

1536
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:08,649
Not me.

1537
02:39:08,649 --> 02:39:10,329
I don't show this one to my doctor.

1538
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:16,200
Here's one money.

1539
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:16,680
That's it.

1540
02:39:17,399 --> 02:39:23,000
You didn't promise pain.

1541
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,440
Wait, why one?

1542
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:25,639
I gave you five pies.

1543
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:29,829
Oh, I'm not okay.

1544
02:39:29,829 --> 02:39:30,549
I'm not very hungry.

1545
02:39:30,549 --> 02:39:31,350
You can hold on to it.

1546
02:39:31,350 --> 02:39:31,590
What?

1547
02:39:32,309 --> 02:39:32,870
Nonsense.

1548
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:34,309
Take one and eat it later when you're hungry.

1549
02:39:34,309 --> 02:39:38,149
All right, now we give the pie to the elk.

1550
02:39:38,149 --> 02:39:40,329
Got a pie.

1551
02:39:40,329 --> 02:39:41,049
Pie to the elk.

1552
02:39:41,690 --> 02:39:42,809
Elk gets out of the water.

1553
02:39:48,860 --> 02:39:49,739
That's a good deal.

1554
02:39:49,739 --> 02:39:51,500
One dollar for five pies.

1555
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:53,579
Done.

1556
02:39:53,579 --> 02:40:04,540
No, my doctor would probably shout bald at me then subscribe to you.

1557
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:07,979
What?

1558
02:40:07,979 --> 02:40:13,450
I've got something for you.

1559
02:40:14,979 --> 02:40:15,620
Questions.

1560
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:17,559
Take a pie.

1561
02:40:18,579 --> 02:40:19,780
That's real and true.

1562
02:40:20,420 --> 02:40:22,500
Are you still hungry?

1563
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:23,059
Yes, very.

1564
02:40:23,059 --> 02:40:24,420
It's making me really rude.

1565
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:27,379
For example, I think your jumper is outdated.

1566
02:40:27,379 --> 02:40:31,139
Victor, I'm not the most fashionable frog in the world,

1567
02:40:31,139 --> 02:40:32,100
but I like this jumper.

1568
02:40:32,100 --> 02:40:32,739
It's my favorite.

1569
02:40:33,299 --> 02:40:33,959
You're right.

1570
02:40:33,959 --> 02:40:35,319
It's retro, not outdated.

1571
02:40:35,319 --> 02:40:36,360
I'm simply very hungry.

1572
02:40:37,799 --> 02:40:39,739
Here is a pie.

1573
02:40:39,739 --> 02:40:40,299
Seriously?

1574
02:40:40,299 --> 02:40:41,340
Score.

1575
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:43,239
Yep, please enjoy it.

1576
02:40:43,239 --> 02:40:44,600
Oh my gosh, that was amazing.

1577
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:48,139
And I feel so much less rude now.

1578
02:40:48,139 --> 02:40:48,860
Really?

1579
02:40:48,860 --> 02:40:49,909
Yep.

1580
02:40:49,909 --> 02:40:51,850
You have beautiful eyes.

1581
02:40:51,850 --> 02:40:52,329
Oh, wow.

1582
02:40:52,329 --> 02:40:53,049
Thank you.

1583
02:40:53,049 --> 02:40:54,569
It's true.

1584
02:40:54,569 --> 02:40:57,780
And I think that color jumper suits you perfectly.

1585
02:40:57,780 --> 02:40:59,450
You're making me blush.

1586
02:40:59,450 --> 02:41:01,049
I should give you something in return for this pie.

1587
02:41:02,709 --> 02:41:04,790
I have a spare party hat I'm not using.

1588
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:05,909
Maybe you could wear it.

1589
02:41:05,909 --> 02:41:09,579
Alas, my head is simply too weird.

1590
02:41:09,579 --> 02:41:11,020
Well, hold on to it anyways.

1591
02:41:11,020 --> 02:41:12,889
Might come in handy.

1592
02:41:12,889 --> 02:41:13,450
Thanks.

1593
02:41:13,450 --> 02:41:16,440
All right, got a party hat.

1594
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:19,000
Party hats for somebody who wanted one of these, right?

1595
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,909
Who wanted the party hat?

1596
02:41:21,909 --> 02:41:23,270
Can you please call Bugleberry again?

1597
02:41:23,270 --> 02:41:25,379
No, I fucking blocked him.

1598
02:41:25,379 --> 02:41:27,059
I blocked his number.

1599
02:41:27,059 --> 02:41:32,489
Bugleberry is worse than a telemarketer.

1600
02:41:32,489 --> 02:41:36,489
I get more calls in the middle of dinner from Bugleberry

1601
02:41:36,489 --> 02:41:40,860
than I do from people trying to sell me shit.

1602
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:42,139
Or take a survey.

1603
02:41:42,139 --> 02:41:45,379
All right, who wanted the party hat?

1604
02:41:45,379 --> 02:41:46,870
Not you.

1605
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:49,180
You?

1606
02:41:49,180 --> 02:41:50,459
You wanted supplies.

1607
02:41:50,459 --> 02:41:51,510
Who wants it?

1608
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:52,149
You want a party hat?

1609
02:41:52,149 --> 02:41:53,110
Who want a party hat?

1610
02:41:53,110 --> 02:42:00,250
Need something to fix her sign?

1611
02:42:00,250 --> 02:42:02,420
Want supplies?

1612
02:42:02,420 --> 02:42:04,700
Want some rug?

1613
02:42:07,110 --> 02:42:11,780
All right, Carlos wants a party hat.

1614
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:14,649
Paul Bugleberry, he's crying.

1615
02:42:14,649 --> 02:42:15,770
He's not crying.

1616
02:42:15,770 --> 02:42:21,100
What would you like to know?

1617
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:23,590
I have a party hat for you.

1618
02:42:23,590 --> 02:42:28,010
Carlos, I have something for you.

1619
02:42:28,010 --> 02:42:29,719
No way.

1620
02:42:29,719 --> 02:42:31,450
It's a party hat.

1621
02:42:31,450 --> 02:42:32,010
No way.

1622
02:42:32,870 --> 02:42:34,139
Yes way.

1623
02:42:34,139 --> 02:42:35,500
That's epic.

1624
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:38,969
That's honestly the most epic thing I've heard all day.

1625
02:42:38,969 --> 02:42:40,090
Thanks, detective.

1626
02:42:40,090 --> 02:42:47,340
Hold on, sorry.

1627
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:49,979
The word epic was said like four times in a row

1628
02:42:49,979 --> 02:42:52,500
and I got a headache.

1629
02:42:52,500 --> 02:42:53,959
Not a problem.

1630
02:42:53,959 --> 02:42:55,860
Incorrect, it was a problem.

1631
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:57,370
And you solved it.

1632
02:42:57,370 --> 02:43:00,139
Just like a true detective.

1633
02:43:00,139 --> 02:43:01,750
Oh, thanks.

1634
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:03,190
You've made a fan out of me.

1635
02:43:03,190 --> 02:43:05,989
Here, let me pay you for your work.

1636
02:43:05,989 --> 02:43:07,190
Oh, no, no, that's okay.

1637
02:43:07,750 --> 02:43:09,909
Detective, I insist you take a payment.

1638
02:43:09,909 --> 02:43:11,270
One money should do it.

1639
02:43:11,270 --> 02:43:17,899
Three dollars?

1640
02:43:17,899 --> 02:43:19,420
Carlos just subscribed.

1641
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:20,780
Thanks for the sub, Carlos.

1642
02:43:20,780 --> 02:43:21,579
Appreciate it.

1643
02:43:21,579 --> 02:43:25,430
Thanks for the sub.

1644
02:43:25,430 --> 02:43:27,350
Welcome to the stream.

1645
02:43:27,350 --> 02:43:29,719
Oh, I also found this rug out back.

1646
02:43:29,719 --> 02:43:30,840
Not sure what it was for,

1647
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:32,600
but I figured you're good at solving these puzzles.

1648
02:43:32,600 --> 02:43:35,750
All right, now we got a rug.

1649
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:36,950
Read his sub message.

1650
02:43:36,950 --> 02:43:46,040
I just did.

1651
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:48,040
Bugleberry just messaged me on AIM.

1652
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:48,840
He's coming over.

1653
02:43:50,219 --> 02:43:51,979
Don't let Bugleberry over your house.

1654
02:43:51,979 --> 02:43:54,280
He's never going to leave.

1655
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:56,969
He'll find excuses to stay.

1656
02:43:56,969 --> 02:44:01,129
You'll be there for four hours

1657
02:44:01,129 --> 02:44:02,250
sitting there watching TV

1658
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:06,010
and you know that he's not going to leave anytime soon,

1659
02:44:06,010 --> 02:44:07,049
but you want him to leave,

1660
02:44:07,049 --> 02:44:09,850
but there's no reason for him to leave

1661
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:11,930
because you said it was okay for him to come over.

1662
02:44:11,930 --> 02:44:12,969
So you're sitting on the couch,

1663
02:44:12,969 --> 02:44:14,969
both just watching fucking random videos

1664
02:44:14,969 --> 02:44:17,129
or YouTube videos or TV shows.

1665
02:44:17,129 --> 02:44:21,290
It's like, we're not doing anything.

1666
02:44:21,290 --> 02:44:22,329
We're not going anywhere.

1667
02:44:22,329 --> 02:44:23,610
I don't want you to be here anymore,

1668
02:44:23,610 --> 02:44:26,950
but I don't have a reason to make you leave.

1669
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:29,239
And then out of nowhere,

1670
02:44:29,239 --> 02:44:30,920
you're hoping you don't hear it, but you do.

1671
02:44:33,959 --> 02:44:34,520
You hungry?

1672
02:44:35,530 --> 02:44:37,530
Let's order some food.

1673
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:39,690
It's like, oh, that's at least another fucking 30 minutes

1674
02:44:39,690 --> 02:44:42,040
before the food to get here.

1675
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:43,559
And now you're going to be here for like an hour.

1676
02:44:43,559 --> 02:44:44,680
There's a two hours now.

1677
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:46,309
Or we're going to go somewhere instead.

1678
02:44:46,309 --> 02:44:46,870
I don't want to pay.

1679
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:47,750
I don't want to do that right now.

1680
02:44:47,750 --> 02:44:50,950
I'm going to make a tuna sandwich in the fridge.

1681
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:51,909
No, I'm all good.

1682
02:44:51,909 --> 02:44:52,309
I'm good.

1683
02:44:52,309 --> 02:44:52,549
I'm good.

1684
02:44:52,549 --> 02:44:53,590
I don't want food.

1685
02:44:53,590 --> 02:44:56,309
Oh, what was the last time you ate?

1686
02:44:56,309 --> 02:44:57,020
Fuck.

1687
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:57,659
Okay.

1688
02:44:57,659 --> 02:44:59,780
You've been here for four hours, so you know.

1689
02:44:59,780 --> 02:45:01,540
It's been at least probably six hours.

1690
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:02,600
I'm not hungry.

1691
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:03,479
Not really.

1692
02:45:03,479 --> 02:45:07,770
That was a real wink.

1693
02:45:07,770 --> 02:45:12,489
All right.

1694
02:45:12,489 --> 02:45:17,129
Rug.

1695
02:45:17,129 --> 02:45:19,290
Bugaberry is a positive role model.

1696
02:45:19,290 --> 02:45:23,829
Tell me what you want to know.

1697
02:45:23,829 --> 02:45:26,200
I got a rug.

1698
02:45:26,200 --> 02:45:27,079
Scam wink.

1699
02:45:27,079 --> 02:45:28,020
All right.

1700
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:29,780
Let me just get like 10 of them out of the way

1701
02:45:29,780 --> 02:45:31,059
because I'm going to get scammed.

1702
02:45:31,059 --> 02:45:39,500
Great news.

1703
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:41,459
What is it?

1704
02:45:41,459 --> 02:45:45,579
I found you a rug.

1705
02:45:45,579 --> 02:45:46,540
What?

1706
02:45:46,540 --> 02:45:48,059
Holy guacaboli.

1707
02:45:48,059 --> 02:45:49,340
This is great news.

1708
02:45:49,340 --> 02:45:50,780
Thanks for tracking it down.

1709
02:45:50,780 --> 02:45:51,899
This should do the trick.

1710
02:45:51,899 --> 02:45:52,219
Wow.

1711
02:45:52,219 --> 02:45:53,500
It looks just like new.

1712
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:55,559
Hopefully the band won't notice the mess.

1713
02:45:55,559 --> 02:46:04,170
You just tanked the wink market.

1714
02:46:04,170 --> 02:46:04,329
Yeah.

1715
02:46:04,329 --> 02:46:05,770
Now it's worth like one cent.

1716
02:46:05,850 --> 02:46:12,899
I don't think they will.

1717
02:46:12,899 --> 02:46:14,180
They're in a fish tank anyway.

1718
02:46:16,280 --> 02:46:16,600
Why?

1719
02:46:17,850 --> 02:46:18,489
One guess.

1720
02:46:19,850 --> 02:46:20,649
They're a fish.

1721
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:22,649
Bingo.

1722
02:46:24,170 --> 02:46:24,489
Wait.

1723
02:46:24,489 --> 02:46:25,450
Do you mean to tell me

1724
02:46:26,010 --> 02:46:28,489
you got the most famous band of all time?

1725
02:46:28,489 --> 02:46:29,770
The Market Buddies?

1726
02:46:30,579 --> 02:46:30,899
Yep.

1727
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:32,659
They're on their way.

1728
02:46:32,659 --> 02:46:32,979
Wow.

1729
02:46:32,979 --> 02:46:35,139
I saw them live once and it was blown away.

1730
02:46:36,250 --> 02:46:38,309
I just shorted it.

1731
02:46:38,309 --> 02:46:39,989
Oh, you just shorted?

1732
02:46:39,989 --> 02:46:42,040
Did you?

1733
02:46:42,040 --> 02:46:42,440
Oh, wow.

1734
02:46:42,440 --> 02:46:43,959
I'm really sorry to hear that.

1735
02:46:43,959 --> 02:46:44,360
Sorry.

1736
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:46,920
Oh, you shorted the winks.

1737
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:47,639
Wow.

1738
02:46:47,639 --> 02:46:53,299
Winks are now a million points.

1739
02:46:53,299 --> 02:46:54,020
Fucking idiot.

1740
02:47:04,229 --> 02:47:05,270
I can't wait.

1741
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:09,430
I'm excited too.

1742
02:47:09,430 --> 02:47:11,350
I can't wait for the parade to begin.

1743
02:47:11,350 --> 02:47:13,180
I better get back to work.

1744
02:47:13,180 --> 02:47:13,979
Did I get any money?

1745
02:47:13,979 --> 02:47:15,399
Before you go,

1746
02:47:15,399 --> 02:47:16,680
I should give you something in return.

1747
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:17,799
One dollar.

1748
02:47:17,799 --> 02:47:21,899
I have some building supplies left over

1749
02:47:21,899 --> 02:47:22,860
from when I made the stage.

1750
02:47:22,860 --> 02:47:24,059
Is that enough?

1751
02:47:24,059 --> 02:47:24,540
Yeah.

1752
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:25,260
Thank you.

1753
02:47:25,260 --> 02:47:30,629
Real wink.

1754
02:47:30,629 --> 02:47:32,469
So this is if a real wink comes in,

1755
02:47:32,469 --> 02:47:37,020
I just stare and then people realize,

1756
02:47:37,020 --> 02:47:37,979
oh, no, no, no.

1757
02:47:37,979 --> 02:47:38,379
Oh my God.

1758
02:47:38,379 --> 02:47:38,700
Oh my God.

1759
02:47:38,700 --> 02:47:39,500
They're worthless.

1760
02:47:39,500 --> 02:47:39,979
Oh my God.

1761
02:47:39,979 --> 02:47:40,620
Now they're not.

1762
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:44,549
Now I can't even get a wink for buying a wink.

1763
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:46,469
Now I go.

1764
02:47:46,469 --> 02:47:48,010
This is when I go to court and shit.

1765
02:47:48,010 --> 02:47:49,049
I get sued.

1766
02:47:49,049 --> 02:47:50,809
And it's a fucking mess.

1767
02:47:50,809 --> 02:47:51,610
Get out now.

1768
02:47:51,610 --> 02:48:01,770
It was simply a favor.

1769
02:48:01,770 --> 02:48:04,280
Don't be silly.

1770
02:48:04,280 --> 02:48:05,879
You worked hard to get me this rug.

1771
02:48:05,879 --> 02:48:07,079
I insist.

1772
02:48:07,079 --> 02:48:07,719
Wow, thanks.

1773
02:48:09,290 --> 02:48:11,610
Got one money and building supplies.

1774
02:48:19,379 --> 02:48:21,299
These voices are making my teeth fall out.

1775
02:48:23,420 --> 02:48:26,059
I'm going to be really honest with you here.

1776
02:48:26,059 --> 02:48:27,659
I think that's just a coincidence of you

1777
02:48:27,659 --> 02:48:29,180
not going to the dentist for 10 years.

1778
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:31,819
It happened now.

1779
02:48:32,780 --> 02:48:33,979
Like your teeth started.

1780
02:48:33,979 --> 02:48:34,940
It had nothing to do with me.

1781
02:48:35,500 --> 02:48:44,870
I hear the supplies.

1782
02:48:48,940 --> 02:48:50,219
The wink is a scam.

1783
02:48:50,219 --> 02:48:50,620
Dump it.

1784
02:48:50,620 --> 02:48:51,659
Dump all your points.

1785
02:48:52,790 --> 02:48:53,750
Dump all points.

1786
02:48:53,750 --> 02:48:55,270
Invest in highlights.

1787
02:48:55,270 --> 02:48:55,829
Oh, no.

1788
02:48:56,469 --> 02:48:57,989
You guys are just throwing it all away.

1789
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:01,559
Hello, small frog.

1790
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:04,120
I managed to track down some building supplies.

1791
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:05,719
Oh, great.

1792
02:49:05,719 --> 02:49:07,159
What exciting news.

1793
02:49:07,159 --> 02:49:09,239
I'd love to use them if you're okay to hand them over.

1794
02:49:10,489 --> 02:49:12,010
You guys are really selling all your points.

1795
02:49:14,920 --> 02:49:17,000
We just like banged all these out in a row.

1796
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:17,559
Holy shit.

1797
02:49:17,559 --> 02:49:19,000
That was one, two, three, four, five.

1798
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:24,739
Excellent.

1799
02:49:25,379 --> 02:49:26,739
Thank you so much.

1800
02:49:26,739 --> 02:49:28,379
Of course, I must pay you for this.

1801
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:30,059
Oh, there's no need.

1802
02:49:30,059 --> 02:49:30,459
Really?

1803
02:49:31,579 --> 02:49:32,700
I won't hear it.

1804
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:33,579
Please take a money.

1805
02:49:37,420 --> 02:49:37,979
One money.

1806
02:49:39,290 --> 02:49:40,260
Thank you.

1807
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:41,459
Also, I think you've earned yourself

1808
02:49:41,459 --> 02:49:43,059
the title of honorary pirate.

1809
02:49:44,180 --> 02:49:45,159
Wow.

1810
02:49:45,159 --> 02:49:45,559
Really?

1811
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:46,360
Me?

1812
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:47,559
A pirate?

1813
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:49,959
Yes, you have the treasure collecting skills

1814
02:49:49,959 --> 02:49:51,319
of the finest pirate.

1815
02:49:51,319 --> 02:49:53,610
For this, I must award you a special prize.

1816
02:49:54,250 --> 02:49:55,290
Here, take this hook.

1817
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:57,510
Got a hook.

1818
02:49:58,860 --> 02:49:59,979
The hook goes over here.

1819
02:49:59,979 --> 02:50:01,979
We did this all in a row in 10 seconds.

1820
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:05,100
Why am I not reading highlighted messages?

1821
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:06,219
Because there's a million of them.

1822
02:50:09,020 --> 02:50:10,940
Wait, when did I say that I read out loud

1823
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:17,559
all highlighted messages?

1824
02:50:17,559 --> 02:50:18,040
I don't.

1825
02:50:19,370 --> 02:50:20,409
That's impossible.

1826
02:50:23,799 --> 02:50:25,159
Because you devalued the wing.

1827
02:50:25,799 --> 02:50:28,659
So you guys are just devaluing

1828
02:50:28,659 --> 02:50:30,180
the highlighted chat messages.

1829
02:50:30,180 --> 02:50:30,819
That's what you're doing.

1830
02:50:33,430 --> 02:50:35,670
The more you do that, the more devalued they become.

1831
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:38,620
Dermot lied about reading highlights.

1832
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:39,899
Hey, what?

1833
02:50:39,899 --> 02:50:42,629
Dermot, you just said, all right, I'm moving on.

1834
02:50:42,629 --> 02:50:43,510
Look at this chat.

1835
02:50:43,510 --> 02:50:47,540
What a fucking engaged chat, by the way.

1836
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:48,100
Look at this.

1837
02:50:52,329 --> 02:50:57,260
This is the third worst chat experience.

1838
02:50:57,260 --> 02:50:58,139
What are you talking about?

1839
02:50:58,139 --> 02:51:00,940
I would put this as the first best chat experience of 2020.

1840
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:05,799
Sorry, I didn't really know why I said that.

1841
02:51:06,809 --> 02:51:07,370
All good.

1842
02:51:07,370 --> 02:51:08,409
Enjoy the hook.

1843
02:51:08,409 --> 02:51:09,510
And move over here.

1844
02:51:10,069 --> 02:51:18,620
Dermot, this is inhuman.

1845
02:51:19,180 --> 02:51:21,190
I didn't do anything.

1846
02:51:21,909 --> 02:51:24,069
I did Bernie Sanders for three hours.

1847
02:51:24,069 --> 02:51:27,260
Look what I got.

1848
02:51:27,979 --> 02:51:31,819
Okay, here's a hook.

1849
02:51:32,379 --> 02:51:37,020
You're back.

1850
02:51:39,879 --> 02:51:40,840
I found you a hook.

1851
02:51:41,559 --> 02:51:42,680
Oh, my stars.

1852
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:43,079
Thank you.

1853
02:51:43,079 --> 02:51:44,840
I can fix my sign right away.

1854
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:45,319
That's okay.

1855
02:51:45,959 --> 02:51:49,100
It's welcome.

1856
02:51:53,159 --> 02:51:54,920
I would like to repay you for this hook.

1857
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:55,479
Let me guess.

1858
02:51:56,440 --> 02:51:57,159
One coin.

1859
02:51:57,719 --> 02:51:58,520
I got it for free.

1860
02:51:59,159 --> 02:52:00,520
Nothing is free in this world.

1861
02:52:01,079 --> 02:52:01,719
Just kidding.

1862
02:52:01,719 --> 02:52:03,479
Our society is really progressive

1863
02:52:03,479 --> 02:52:04,840
and often things are actually free.

1864
02:52:05,639 --> 02:52:09,670
As a sign of my gratitude,

1865
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:11,909
please feel free to use my house whenever you need.

1866
02:52:12,549 --> 02:52:13,670
I can just use your house?

1867
02:52:15,270 --> 02:52:17,350
It's fairly simple, but beautifully decorated at least.

1868
02:52:19,959 --> 02:52:21,319
I have a phone too.

1869
02:52:21,319 --> 02:52:21,639
Great.

1870
02:52:21,639 --> 02:52:22,760
I'll be sure to use that.

1871
02:52:23,319 --> 02:52:24,280
I now live here.

1872
02:52:25,159 --> 02:52:26,360
Thank you, Susan.

1873
02:52:26,360 --> 02:52:35,190
I've worked really hard.

1874
02:52:37,659 --> 02:52:38,940
When's community content night?

1875
02:52:42,059 --> 02:52:45,180
Give or take maybe like 12 minutes from right now

1876
02:52:45,180 --> 02:52:54,459
because I think we're at the end of the game.

1877
02:52:54,459 --> 02:52:55,340
Anything in here?

1878
02:52:55,340 --> 02:53:01,030
Should I use the phone?

1879
02:53:01,030 --> 02:53:02,540
Yeah, there'll be a pee break.

1880
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:04,649
Who should I call?

1881
02:53:04,649 --> 02:53:12,620
Oh, I don't have any numbers.

1882
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:12,940
Okay.

1883
02:53:14,489 --> 02:53:18,260
Well, how much money do I have?

1884
02:53:18,260 --> 02:53:20,739
I have five money, which is what...

1885
02:53:20,739 --> 02:53:21,299
Who wanted...

1886
02:53:21,299 --> 02:53:22,340
You wanted five money.

1887
02:53:26,090 --> 02:53:26,729
Five money?

1888
02:53:29,670 --> 02:53:30,069
Oh, boy.

1889
02:53:30,069 --> 02:53:30,950
I love questions.

1890
02:53:32,069 --> 02:53:32,870
Five money.

1891
02:53:33,510 --> 02:53:36,299
Hi, Mary.

1892
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:37,659
Hey, Detective.

1893
02:53:38,219 --> 02:53:41,059
How's the extortion going?

1894
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:43,750
I think I've got your five money.

1895
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:45,719
Well, for real?

1896
02:53:47,340 --> 02:53:49,420
I didn't think the extortion would work so quickly.

1897
02:53:50,139 --> 02:53:51,610
That's excellent news.

1898
02:53:52,250 --> 02:53:54,329
I'm really good at being extorted.

1899
02:53:54,889 --> 02:53:56,329
I'll say.

1900
02:53:58,010 --> 02:54:00,250
Anyway, do you have the information for me?

1901
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:02,649
Totally.

1902
02:54:03,739 --> 02:54:06,459
Last night, I saw the postman drop off a parcel.

1903
02:54:07,100 --> 02:54:09,829
It was around the time the parade got destroyed.

1904
02:54:10,870 --> 02:54:12,709
I couldn't see who he was giving it to,

1905
02:54:13,430 --> 02:54:15,190
but it was someone here in the town.

1906
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:18,260
Barney is the postman's name.

1907
02:54:18,899 --> 02:54:20,420
He's a chill dude.

1908
02:54:20,420 --> 02:54:22,180
I don't think he'd mind if you called him.

1909
02:54:22,739 --> 02:54:23,909
Have his number.

1910
02:54:25,079 --> 02:54:25,719
May I have it?

1911
02:54:26,729 --> 02:54:27,370
Absolutely.

1912
02:54:28,010 --> 02:54:30,329
Got phone number.

1913
02:54:30,329 --> 02:54:34,620
Thanks for giving me this money.

1914
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:36,940
I'm really excited to see Froggy Wood.

1915
02:54:37,659 --> 02:54:38,760
I'm excited too.

1916
02:54:40,729 --> 02:54:42,170
And then I have to wait until the parade's over.

1917
02:54:42,170 --> 02:54:42,729
Of course.

1918
02:54:42,729 --> 02:54:43,850
See you around, Detective.

1919
02:54:44,729 --> 02:54:46,090
Now we call Barney.

1920
02:54:46,090 --> 02:54:48,540
Who knows Cam?

1921
02:54:48,540 --> 02:56:04,459
Everybody always talk shit when we repeat a joke on the channel.

1922
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:07,659
You guys are going to request knows Cam.

1923
02:56:08,739 --> 02:56:09,700
How dare you?

1924
02:56:09,700 --> 02:56:11,059
I'll actually fucking dare you.

1925
02:56:17,579 --> 02:56:18,219
Who should I call?

1926
02:56:19,180 --> 02:56:20,459
Call the mysterious number.

1927
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:29,479
That's a small phone number.

1928
02:56:34,299 --> 02:56:35,020
He's driving.

1929
02:56:40,819 --> 02:56:42,420
Hi, it's Barney.

1930
02:56:42,420 --> 02:56:44,340
I have you on speaker.

1931
02:56:44,340 --> 02:56:45,940
Hi Barney.

1932
02:56:46,579 --> 02:56:46,899
Hi.

1933
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:48,579
Who am I talking to?

1934
02:56:50,780 --> 02:56:51,500
Lobster cop.

1935
02:56:52,299 --> 02:56:53,100
Wow, really?

1936
02:56:54,139 --> 02:56:55,100
No, I was tricking you.

1937
02:56:56,600 --> 02:56:57,000
Rats.

1938
02:56:57,639 --> 02:56:59,850
Who is this noodle?

1939
02:56:59,850 --> 02:57:00,809
I'm the detective.

1940
02:57:00,809 --> 02:57:03,610
I'm calling about an incident that happened last night on Warlock Woods.

1941
02:57:04,709 --> 02:57:05,510
I didn't do it.

1942
02:57:06,629 --> 02:57:07,110
Do what?

1943
02:57:07,909 --> 02:57:11,299
Whatever you're calling about, it wasn't me.

1944
02:57:11,299 --> 02:57:14,920
Are you sure?

1945
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:16,870
What did I do?

1946
02:57:16,870 --> 02:57:18,709
Last night someone destroyed a parade,

1947
02:57:18,709 --> 02:57:22,069
which was being set up for the new resident of the town, the invisible wizard.

1948
02:57:22,069 --> 02:57:26,040
I was told you were in the area when it happened.

1949
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:28,020
Oh yeah, I was there.

1950
02:57:28,020 --> 02:57:30,180
Didn't destroy anything, if that's what you're asking.

1951
02:57:30,819 --> 02:57:32,579
Was just delivering a parcel.

1952
02:57:32,579 --> 02:57:34,940
Who were you delivering it to?

1953
02:57:38,329 --> 02:57:39,049
What was your name?

1954
02:57:40,360 --> 02:57:41,239
Lola.

1955
02:57:41,239 --> 02:57:45,559
I don't think there's anyone in town called Lola.

1956
02:57:45,559 --> 02:57:48,840
Must have been someone who lives there that the dress was drawn to parcel.

1957
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:51,620
Oh, I can't remember exactly what house it was.

1958
02:57:51,620 --> 02:57:52,340
Sorry.

1959
02:57:52,340 --> 02:57:57,049
Do you remember where the parcel was sent from?

1960
02:57:57,049 --> 02:57:59,530
Oh yeah, I deliver a lot of parcels from them.

1961
02:57:59,530 --> 02:58:03,129
It was from the Wizbay.Bet headquarters.

1962
02:58:03,129 --> 02:58:06,729
That sounds really familiar, like the two of us on the phone right now.

1963
02:58:06,729 --> 02:58:09,370
You just are a little older sounding than me.

1964
02:58:09,370 --> 02:58:11,959
Where have I heard that name before?

1965
02:58:11,959 --> 02:58:15,819
I know Mandy's buys a lot of stuff from there, but this wasn't for her.

1966
02:58:15,819 --> 02:58:18,040
Do you know what was in the package?

1967
02:58:18,040 --> 02:58:19,540
Some sort of shoe, I think.

1968
02:58:19,540 --> 02:58:20,579
Maybe two shoes?

1969
02:58:20,579 --> 02:58:21,540
Her shoes?

1970
02:58:21,540 --> 02:58:23,799
Did you get a good look at them?

1971
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:26,500
It was pretty dark.

1972
02:58:26,500 --> 02:58:30,729
I have no recollection of really seeing anyone.

1973
02:58:30,729 --> 02:58:32,649
Not even if this guy's a terrible mailman.

1974
02:58:32,649 --> 02:58:36,010
Yeah, 6666 viewers right now.

1975
02:58:36,010 --> 02:58:39,540
Fucking parade.

1976
02:58:39,540 --> 02:58:41,459
Oh weird, Warlock Woods is pretty dark,

1977
02:58:41,459 --> 02:58:43,700
but I haven't had much trouble seeing anyone before.

1978
02:58:43,700 --> 02:58:46,700
Me neither.

1979
02:58:46,700 --> 02:58:48,620
It wasn't much more dark than normal either.

1980
02:58:48,620 --> 02:58:50,780
All I remember is a blue dress with stars on it.

1981
02:58:50,780 --> 02:58:53,479
I'm pretty stumped on this case, Barney.

1982
02:58:53,479 --> 02:58:55,159
Do you know if there were any clues left behind?

1983
02:58:55,159 --> 02:58:58,010
A signature on the delivery slip or something?

1984
02:58:58,010 --> 02:58:59,530
I didn't get them to sign it,

1985
02:58:59,530 --> 02:59:02,709
but I remember someone dropping over at the entrance to the woods.

1986
02:59:02,709 --> 02:59:06,549
I tried to call it, tell them, but they'd stumble off before I noticed.

1987
02:59:06,549 --> 02:59:08,969
At the entrance to the woods, you say?

1988
02:59:08,969 --> 02:59:09,690
I'll check it out.

1989
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:12,729
What did we just have?

1990
02:59:12,729 --> 02:59:13,850
Fucking community subs?

1991
02:59:13,850 --> 02:59:18,069
How many subs just came in?

1992
02:59:18,069 --> 02:59:24,739
One, two, three, four, five, six community subs from Great Canadian FK Club.

1993
02:59:24,739 --> 02:59:28,379
Thank you.

1994
02:59:28,379 --> 02:59:29,340
Thanks, Great Canadian.

1995
02:59:29,340 --> 02:59:29,979
Appreciate it.

1996
02:59:29,979 --> 02:59:35,110
Accidentally crashed his van into the decorations to roll away without realizing.

1997
02:59:35,110 --> 02:59:38,309
All right, well, we have a new motive.

1998
02:59:38,309 --> 02:59:46,139
So now we have to go look for this package, wherever that is.

1999
02:59:46,139 --> 02:59:48,069
I don't know.

2000
02:59:48,069 --> 02:59:50,549
What about, didn't they say it was in the beginning of the town?

2001
02:59:50,549 --> 02:59:55,780
Did I not leave?

2002
02:59:55,780 --> 02:59:58,020
I mean, I know it's that person's username, right?

2003
02:59:58,020 --> 02:59:59,860
The eBay, whatever it was.

2004
02:59:59,860 --> 03:00:01,500
I missed it?

2005
03:00:01,500 --> 03:00:07,750
This must be the thing Barney was talking about.

2006
03:00:07,750 --> 03:00:14,520
Hmm, they're glasses.

2007
03:00:14,520 --> 03:00:16,620
Oh, they have a name engraved on them.

2008
03:00:16,620 --> 03:00:17,739
The Invisible Wizard.

2009
03:00:17,739 --> 03:00:18,940
Well, this is my only clue left.

2010
03:00:18,940 --> 03:00:20,620
I think I should try and return these to the wizard.

2011
03:00:20,700 --> 03:00:27,690
You should be in the old house near Carlos's shop.

2012
03:00:27,690 --> 03:00:28,809
Use your fucking eyes.

2013
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:32,180
Use your glasses, Jeremy.

2014
03:00:32,180 --> 03:00:36,100
Don't anger me.

2015
03:00:36,659 --> 03:00:39,670
All right, where's the wizard's house?

2016
03:00:39,670 --> 03:00:40,870
Right here.

2017
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:47,899
Hello, is anyone home?

2018
03:00:47,899 --> 03:01:05,350
I found these glasses.

2019
03:01:05,350 --> 03:01:15,079
All right, it's an invisible wizard, but not really.

2020
03:01:15,079 --> 03:01:42,149
I'll just find you again.

2021
03:01:43,190 --> 03:01:44,069
Was that real?

2022
03:01:44,069 --> 03:01:44,870
I don't know, man.

2023
03:01:44,870 --> 03:01:46,790
This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.

2024
03:01:47,670 --> 03:01:50,649
This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.

2025
03:01:50,649 --> 03:02:03,350
Oh, this is seriously fucking scaring the shit out of me.

2026
03:02:03,989 --> 03:02:19,319
It's fucking crazy.

2027
03:02:19,319 --> 03:02:20,680
This is scaring the shit out of me.

2028
03:02:22,059 --> 03:02:23,020
Door opened?

2029
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:23,899
Fuck, okay.

2030
03:02:25,260 --> 03:02:40,649
Fuck, Jesus.

2031
03:02:40,649 --> 03:02:42,569
This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.

2032
03:02:49,750 --> 03:02:51,190
Ah, who was there?

2033
03:02:51,829 --> 03:02:53,770
Oh, I'm sorry.

2034
03:02:53,770 --> 03:02:55,129
I didn't mean to startle you.

2035
03:02:56,309 --> 03:02:57,190
I'm the detective.

2036
03:03:01,750 --> 03:03:02,870
Oh, thank goodness.

2037
03:03:03,819 --> 03:03:05,420
You're here to solve the mystery.

2038
03:03:06,700 --> 03:03:07,200
Yes.

2039
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:09,500
Okay.

2040
03:03:10,200 --> 03:03:12,520
Well, I don't know where my glasses are.

2041
03:03:13,399 --> 03:03:15,559
So solve that as soon as possible, please.

2042
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:17,159
Thanks in advance.

2043
03:03:17,719 --> 03:03:21,100
I found your glasses, I think.

2044
03:03:22,409 --> 03:03:23,129
Are these yours?

2045
03:03:23,770 --> 03:03:26,569
Oh, I can see again.

2046
03:03:26,569 --> 03:03:27,450
That was so quick.

2047
03:03:28,010 --> 03:03:29,129
You should get a promotion.

2048
03:03:29,770 --> 03:03:32,409
I don't remember calling a detective to solve this mystery,

2049
03:03:32,409 --> 03:03:33,690
but I must have done so.

2050
03:03:34,700 --> 03:03:37,100
Otherwise, why would you be here right now?

2051
03:03:44,250 --> 03:03:44,750
Yeah.

2052
03:03:46,229 --> 03:03:48,250
Well, no.

2053
03:03:49,379 --> 03:03:51,139
I'm actually here to solve a different mystery.

2054
03:03:51,860 --> 03:03:55,739
Which one?

2055
03:03:56,299 --> 03:03:58,360
I don't mean to ruin surprise,

2056
03:03:58,360 --> 03:04:00,200
but the town was setting up a parade for you.

2057
03:04:02,100 --> 03:04:04,100
I'm sorry to tell you last night.

2058
03:04:04,659 --> 03:04:06,500
I'm sorry to tell you that last night,

2059
03:04:06,500 --> 03:04:07,540
someone destroyed it.

2060
03:04:10,010 --> 03:04:11,690
Wait, you're the wizard doing the wrong voice?

2061
03:04:13,700 --> 03:04:14,180
Oh, fuck.

2062
03:04:14,180 --> 03:04:14,500
You're right.

2063
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:15,000
Sorry.

2064
03:04:17,610 --> 03:04:20,889
However, I've noticed that your house is littered with the decorations.

2065
03:04:20,889 --> 03:04:26,940
Where were you last night?

2066
03:04:26,940 --> 03:04:31,899
I was out in Whismay.

2067
03:04:31,899 --> 03:04:33,340
I got some new shoes.

2068
03:04:34,139 --> 03:04:35,899
I picked express delivery.

2069
03:04:35,899 --> 03:04:37,180
They arrived last night.

2070
03:04:39,190 --> 03:04:40,229
Oh, you're Lola.

2071
03:04:41,290 --> 03:04:41,790
Yes.

2072
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:43,879
Back to my alibi.

2073
03:04:44,440 --> 03:04:48,500
I went to pick up my shoes from the delivery guy.

2074
03:04:49,799 --> 03:04:51,639
And then I dropped my glasses.

2075
03:04:51,639 --> 03:05:04,360
Needs echo.

2076
03:05:04,360 --> 03:05:04,920
Oh.

2077
03:05:04,920 --> 03:05:08,899
And that's all I have to say about that.

2078
03:05:08,899 --> 03:05:11,270
Are you sure?

2079
03:05:12,620 --> 03:05:13,340
Yes.

2080
03:05:13,340 --> 03:05:15,579
I think someone else must have destroyed the parade.

2081
03:05:16,139 --> 03:05:18,309
Perhaps one of my enemies.

2082
03:05:22,180 --> 03:05:23,139
You have enemies?

2083
03:05:24,790 --> 03:05:25,909
Um, yeah.

2084
03:05:26,469 --> 03:05:30,420
Who?

2085
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:31,299
The guy.

2086
03:05:33,620 --> 03:05:34,579
People think it's Bugleberry.

2087
03:05:34,579 --> 03:05:35,379
You're losing viewers.

2088
03:05:41,079 --> 03:05:41,799
Evil guy.

2089
03:05:43,319 --> 03:05:44,360
Sorry, what?

2090
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:44,860
Enemy.

2091
03:05:46,040 --> 03:05:49,479
An enemy, evil, a giant, evil enemy.

2092
03:05:49,479 --> 03:05:49,979
Enemy.

2093
03:05:50,840 --> 03:05:51,930
Evil guy?

2094
03:05:53,379 --> 03:05:53,879
Yeah.

2095
03:05:54,420 --> 03:05:55,819
Are you making this up?

2096
03:05:57,180 --> 03:05:57,680
No.

2097
03:05:58,219 --> 03:06:00,620
Evil dude really is my giant enemy.

2098
03:06:01,260 --> 03:06:02,870
Don't you mean evil guy?

2099
03:06:04,870 --> 03:06:05,989
Evil guy.

2100
03:06:05,989 --> 03:06:09,350
He's posting, he's posting cringe.

2101
03:06:13,030 --> 03:06:13,530
Shut up.

2102
03:06:14,229 --> 03:06:14,870
Shut up.

2103
03:06:15,670 --> 03:06:16,309
Quiet.

2104
03:06:16,309 --> 03:06:17,270
Quiet that person.

2105
03:06:17,989 --> 03:06:18,950
Your enemy?

2106
03:06:18,950 --> 03:06:19,450
Yes.

2107
03:06:22,420 --> 03:06:24,260
Where can I contact evil guy?

2108
03:06:25,159 --> 03:06:27,079
Oh, he's not able to be contacted.

2109
03:06:27,079 --> 03:06:29,879
He's very mysterious and he's not available right now.

2110
03:06:36,379 --> 03:06:37,340
Or ever even.

2111
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:39,340
Anyway, he must have destroyed the parade.

2112
03:06:40,780 --> 03:06:41,420
Case solved.

2113
03:06:41,420 --> 03:06:42,219
We did it.

2114
03:06:42,219 --> 03:06:43,100
Well done.

2115
03:06:43,100 --> 03:06:43,819
Well done.

2116
03:06:43,819 --> 03:06:44,299
Wow.

2117
03:06:44,299 --> 03:06:46,379
Too bad he's not able to be apprehended.

2118
03:06:46,379 --> 03:06:48,299
But at least we can continue with our lives.

2119
03:06:48,940 --> 03:06:53,000
Lola, are you being dishonest?

2120
03:06:56,579 --> 03:06:57,079
Yes.

2121
03:06:58,950 --> 03:07:01,270
I'm really sorry.

2122
03:07:01,270 --> 03:07:02,309
It was me.

2123
03:07:02,309 --> 03:07:03,829
It was an accident.

2124
03:07:03,829 --> 03:07:04,709
I swear it.

2125
03:07:05,670 --> 03:07:07,030
You destroyed the parade, didn't you?

2126
03:07:13,129 --> 03:07:14,649
You posted cringe, bro.

2127
03:07:19,030 --> 03:07:20,549
I didn't know the parade was for me.

2128
03:07:20,549 --> 03:07:21,270
That's so nice.

2129
03:07:21,909 --> 03:07:22,870
And I've ruined it.

2130
03:07:23,510 --> 03:07:25,940
When I dropped my glasses, I couldn't find my way home.

2131
03:07:25,940 --> 03:07:26,979
I was bumping into everything.

2132
03:07:26,979 --> 03:07:27,620
It was horrible.

2133
03:07:31,620 --> 03:07:33,860
Don't, please don't post cringe again.

2134
03:07:38,120 --> 03:07:39,239
What happened when you got home?

2135
03:07:40,120 --> 03:07:42,969
I had some chips stuck to me so I ate those.

2136
03:07:42,969 --> 03:07:43,770
And then I just hid.

2137
03:07:44,489 --> 03:07:47,899
Why didn't you tell anyone what happened?

2138
03:07:48,379 --> 03:07:50,969
I'm so embarrassed about it.

2139
03:07:50,969 --> 03:07:54,389
I only just moved in and already I've made a big mistake.

2140
03:07:55,110 --> 03:07:59,930
Can you guys even fucking hear that?

2141
03:07:59,930 --> 03:08:13,340
Why is that not working?

2142
03:08:14,219 --> 03:08:18,139
This has been, this has not been working the whole time.

2143
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:20,819
No way.

2144
03:08:20,819 --> 03:08:27,219
I recorded it.

2145
03:08:27,940 --> 03:08:29,819
Dabba dabba doo.

2146
03:08:30,540 --> 03:08:33,159
Why are you not hearing this?

2147
03:08:33,159 --> 03:08:34,120
I'm so fucking mad.

2148
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,959
I played this like, I've been playing this sentence

2149
03:08:37,959 --> 03:08:40,200
for the last like 15 straight minutes, like every few minutes.

2150
03:08:41,079 --> 03:08:42,280
Because I sampled it.

2151
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:43,559
But why, I don't know why it's not working.

2152
03:08:49,590 --> 03:08:50,870
That, that's annoying.

2153
03:08:51,670 --> 03:08:52,229
That's annoying.

2154
03:08:54,500 --> 03:08:55,620
What the fuck happened?

2155
03:08:55,620 --> 03:08:56,739
Oh, wait, what?

2156
03:08:59,129 --> 03:09:00,170
Oh, that's annoying.

2157
03:09:00,170 --> 03:09:00,729
Whatever.

2158
03:09:00,729 --> 03:09:01,610
Oh, that sucks.

2159
03:09:02,729 --> 03:09:06,229
I thought I had it set up correctly.

2160
03:09:06,229 --> 03:09:07,750
What a pain in the ass, whatever.

2161
03:09:07,750 --> 03:09:09,030
Fucking joke sucked, ruined.

2162
03:09:09,989 --> 03:09:14,120
I sampled myself saying something

2163
03:09:14,120 --> 03:09:15,639
and I was, I thought you guys could hear it

2164
03:09:15,639 --> 03:09:16,920
and I was just not paying attention to it.

2165
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:18,120
It was fucking hilarious.

2166
03:09:18,680 --> 03:09:20,360
I'm a very shy lady detective.

2167
03:09:20,360 --> 03:09:22,760
I make myself invisible so no one can see me.

2168
03:09:22,760 --> 03:09:24,360
That must have been why nobody saw you.

2169
03:09:25,319 --> 03:09:26,120
Yes, I suppose.

2170
03:09:26,680 --> 03:09:28,760
Did it become non-invisible, un-invisible visible?

2171
03:09:30,649 --> 03:09:31,290
You insist.

2172
03:09:32,010 --> 03:09:35,370
Ta-da.

2173
03:09:35,989 --> 03:09:39,930
You're a frog like me.

2174
03:09:40,969 --> 03:09:41,469
Yes.

2175
03:09:42,090 --> 03:09:43,530
I'm slightly disappointed.

2176
03:09:44,090 --> 03:09:44,590
What?

2177
03:09:45,219 --> 03:09:47,139
Well, it's just that I had a good joke prepared.

2178
03:09:47,780 --> 03:09:48,889
I know how it feels.

2179
03:09:49,610 --> 03:09:51,579
We're the same person, you and I.

2180
03:09:51,579 --> 03:09:53,100
Exact same fucking person.

2181
03:09:53,100 --> 03:09:54,459
I'll do it anyways.

2182
03:09:54,459 --> 03:09:56,409
Okay, so imagine that instead of a frog,

2183
03:09:56,409 --> 03:09:57,770
you were revealed to be a lizard.

2184
03:09:58,629 --> 03:09:59,190
Oh, no.

2185
03:10:00,149 --> 03:10:01,590
Okay, so you've just been revealed.

2186
03:10:01,590 --> 03:10:02,309
Okay, pretend.

2187
03:10:03,190 --> 03:10:03,829
Okay.

2188
03:10:03,909 --> 03:10:04,870
It's me, a lizard.

2189
03:10:05,430 --> 03:10:07,989
Wow, so you're not an invisible wizard after all.

2190
03:10:09,399 --> 03:10:10,600
You're an invisible lizard.

2191
03:10:11,239 --> 03:10:12,360
That was way worse than mine.

2192
03:10:13,510 --> 03:10:15,030
I don't even say that that was on the same level

2193
03:10:15,030 --> 03:10:16,229
as the joke I was going to make.

2194
03:10:22,280 --> 03:10:25,399
Don't do minus twos for something I didn't say.

2195
03:10:26,280 --> 03:10:28,360
You know what?

2196
03:10:29,459 --> 03:10:29,940
You know what?

2197
03:10:29,940 --> 03:10:30,979
Fuck you guys, I'm out of here.

2198
03:10:48,149 --> 03:10:49,350
Yeah, it was a good joke.

2199
03:10:49,350 --> 03:10:50,229
I thought, me too.

2200
03:10:50,790 --> 03:10:52,440
Detective, are you going to tell everyone?

2201
03:10:55,819 --> 03:11:03,579
Was that even a joke you were going to make?

2202
03:11:03,579 --> 03:11:04,219
No, no.

2203
03:11:05,659 --> 03:11:06,620
Why is it not playing?

2204
03:11:06,620 --> 03:11:08,860
It lights up and I can see it playing.

2205
03:11:08,860 --> 03:11:15,350
It's just not being broadcast through to you guys

2206
03:11:15,350 --> 03:11:16,389
for some crazy reason.

2207
03:11:17,030 --> 03:11:19,270
More, if you tell everyone what I did,

2208
03:11:19,270 --> 03:11:19,989
they will be upset.

2209
03:11:20,549 --> 03:11:23,180
I think they'd forgive you right away.

2210
03:11:24,299 --> 03:11:27,079
What if they don't?

2211
03:11:27,079 --> 03:11:28,600
I want to make a good first impression.

2212
03:11:29,239 --> 03:11:30,569
When we go outside,

2213
03:11:30,569 --> 03:11:32,889
can you please tell them that it was evil guy?

2214
03:11:33,530 --> 03:11:34,250
That's a lie.

2215
03:11:34,809 --> 03:11:36,090
A white lie, perhaps.

2216
03:11:36,090 --> 03:11:37,690
But who is it harming really?

2217
03:11:37,690 --> 03:11:38,489
Evil guy.

2218
03:11:38,489 --> 03:11:39,850
Evil guy isn't real.

2219
03:11:39,850 --> 03:11:41,610
This is a moral dilemma, Lola.

2220
03:11:41,610 --> 03:11:43,530
Just like in my favorite episode of Parriot.

2221
03:11:44,170 --> 03:11:44,899
Parriot.

2222
03:11:45,459 --> 03:11:46,409
Parrois?

2223
03:11:46,409 --> 03:11:46,969
Parrois?

2224
03:11:47,530 --> 03:11:48,090
Parrois?

2225
03:11:49,030 --> 03:11:50,229
It's your choice, detective.

2226
03:11:50,229 --> 03:11:51,110
Let's face the music.

2227
03:11:51,750 --> 03:12:00,760
Or the routing settings in your GoXLR.

2228
03:12:00,760 --> 03:12:01,879
Yeah, I thought I had it set correctly.

2229
03:12:01,879 --> 03:12:02,680
I guess not.

2230
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:09,540
Frog Detective 2, complete.

2231
03:12:10,420 --> 03:12:18,010
Now we're moving on to Community Content Night.

2232
03:12:18,010 --> 03:12:19,610
Episode 2, week 2.

2233
03:12:20,649 --> 03:12:27,379
Hello.

2234
03:12:28,969 --> 03:12:29,610
Hi.

2235
03:12:29,610 --> 03:12:31,819
My name is Lola.

2236
03:12:31,819 --> 03:12:32,780
Hi, Lola.

2237
03:12:32,780 --> 03:12:35,260
I'm a frog, just like me.

2238
03:12:35,819 --> 03:12:37,579
We're so glad you could make it, Lola.

2239
03:12:37,659 --> 03:12:39,340
You guys are standing way too close together.

2240
03:12:39,899 --> 03:12:41,959
Sorry that there's been so much commotion

2241
03:12:41,959 --> 03:12:43,799
trying to get the parade ready for you.

2242
03:12:43,799 --> 03:12:45,239
Somebody destroyed it last night.

2243
03:12:45,799 --> 03:12:46,840
Barry, don't tell her that.

2244
03:12:47,559 --> 03:12:49,319
We're sorry that somebody destroyed it, Lola.

2245
03:12:49,319 --> 03:12:51,239
The detective has been trying to figure out who did it.

2246
03:12:52,979 --> 03:12:54,979
Well, detective, have you solved the mystery?

2247
03:12:54,979 --> 03:12:55,860
Hope it wasn't me.

2248
03:12:56,420 --> 03:12:58,940
I'd be surprised if it was any of us.

2249
03:12:58,940 --> 03:13:00,299
I wouldn't, looking at you, Ralph.

2250
03:13:01,510 --> 03:13:02,010
What?

2251
03:13:02,469 --> 03:13:03,829
Ralph didn't do it, Victor.

2252
03:13:03,829 --> 03:13:05,590
How many times do we have to tell you?

2253
03:13:05,590 --> 03:13:07,110
I just don't trust that guy.

2254
03:13:07,110 --> 03:13:07,610
Rude.

2255
03:13:08,229 --> 03:13:09,510
I'm not rude anymore, Ralph.

2256
03:13:09,510 --> 03:13:10,149
I had food.

2257
03:13:10,790 --> 03:13:12,229
I don't think that's how food works.

2258
03:13:12,950 --> 03:13:13,750
I didn't do it.

2259
03:13:13,750 --> 03:13:15,670
Well, I guess we'll find out in a moment.

2260
03:13:15,670 --> 03:13:21,350
Go ahead, detective.

2261
03:13:21,350 --> 03:13:25,299
She did it.

2262
03:13:25,299 --> 03:13:30,969
Who was it?

2263
03:13:30,969 --> 03:13:33,450
It was, it was Lola.

2264
03:13:33,450 --> 03:13:34,250
What?

2265
03:13:34,250 --> 03:13:36,020
It was an accident.

2266
03:13:36,020 --> 03:13:37,540
Lola dropped her glasses last night

2267
03:13:37,540 --> 03:13:39,780
while picking up some shoes she bought on Whizbay.

2268
03:13:39,780 --> 03:13:42,649
Oh my gosh, those are the ones I really wanted.

2269
03:13:43,290 --> 03:13:44,250
They look amazing.

2270
03:13:45,049 --> 03:13:46,329
Lola can't see without her glasses,

2271
03:13:46,329 --> 03:13:48,090
so she had a lot of trouble getting home last night.

2272
03:13:48,090 --> 03:13:49,129
I'm doing the thing that you,

2273
03:13:49,129 --> 03:13:51,129
I'm doing the mother, the parents,

2274
03:13:51,129 --> 03:13:53,610
reading the story in bed when you were a kid.

2275
03:13:54,329 --> 03:13:55,690
And they're getting, they're losing interest,

2276
03:13:55,690 --> 03:13:56,489
and they're falling asleep,

2277
03:13:56,489 --> 03:13:57,530
and then they start to do,

2278
03:13:57,530 --> 03:13:59,299
we talked about this before.

2279
03:13:59,299 --> 03:14:01,059
She bumped into just about everything.

2280
03:14:01,059 --> 03:14:05,690
I'm so sorry, I feel awful.

2281
03:14:05,690 --> 03:14:07,059
I realized what happened

2282
03:14:07,059 --> 03:14:08,739
when I had lots of chips stuck to me.

2283
03:14:08,739 --> 03:14:12,280
Do the Earth Explodes joke.

2284
03:14:12,280 --> 03:14:12,760
What?

2285
03:14:12,760 --> 03:14:13,879
I ate them, they were delicious.

2286
03:14:13,879 --> 03:14:15,000
The parade was for me all along,

2287
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:16,040
and I didn't realize it.

2288
03:14:16,040 --> 03:14:17,879
Lola was very scared of your reactions,

2289
03:14:17,879 --> 03:14:19,559
so she hid in her house out of shame.

2290
03:14:19,559 --> 03:14:22,069
Oh, Lola, it's okay.

2291
03:14:22,069 --> 03:14:22,950
You should have told us.

2292
03:14:22,950 --> 03:14:24,680
We completely understand.

2293
03:14:24,680 --> 03:14:26,760
Yeah, Mary destroys stuff all the time.

2294
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:27,959
Yeah, I really do.

2295
03:14:27,959 --> 03:14:30,600
Plus, Naughty tried to vacuum you up,

2296
03:14:30,600 --> 03:14:32,120
so I feel like the parade being destroyed

2297
03:14:32,120 --> 03:14:33,079
is kind of fine.

2298
03:14:33,079 --> 03:14:35,430
I thought she was a ghost.

2299
03:14:35,430 --> 03:14:37,350
That's what they all say.

2300
03:14:37,350 --> 03:14:38,620
Hee hee.

2301
03:14:38,620 --> 03:14:40,299
We're all really excited you're here, Lola.

2302
03:14:40,299 --> 03:14:41,979
We don't need decorations anyway.

2303
03:14:41,979 --> 03:14:44,569
I really thought Ralph did it.

2304
03:14:44,569 --> 03:14:45,209
Victor.

2305
03:14:45,209 --> 03:14:51,510
Victor apologized right now to Ralph.

2306
03:14:51,510 --> 03:14:55,399
Ralph, sorry I said ayaya.

2307
03:14:55,399 --> 03:14:56,520
It's not okay.

2308
03:14:56,520 --> 03:14:58,569
This is a real conversation

2309
03:14:58,569 --> 03:15:01,979
that I have with my chat once a week.

2310
03:15:01,979 --> 03:15:03,260
I am also sorry.

2311
03:15:03,260 --> 03:15:04,780
I really didn't mean to destroy the parade,

2312
03:15:04,780 --> 03:15:06,379
but I should have spoken up when I did.

2313
03:15:06,379 --> 03:15:08,469
I'm a very nervous lady.

2314
03:15:08,469 --> 03:15:10,389
Plus, what a terrible first impression.

2315
03:15:10,899 --> 03:15:13,270
Not as bad as my first impression.

2316
03:15:13,270 --> 03:15:14,309
What did you do?

2317
03:15:14,309 --> 03:15:16,700
I ran over Mary by accident.

2318
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:17,899
Ha ha, yeah.

2319
03:15:17,899 --> 03:15:19,690
That was really painful.

2320
03:15:19,690 --> 03:15:20,250
Ha ha.

2321
03:15:20,250 --> 03:15:22,409
Should we get this party started?

2322
03:15:22,409 --> 03:15:23,049
Another party.

2323
03:15:23,049 --> 03:15:23,690
Let's go.

2324
03:15:23,690 --> 03:15:44,409
Are we going to pick another dancer?

2325
03:15:44,409 --> 03:15:45,690
Okay, why does this feel like something

2326
03:15:45,690 --> 03:15:49,340
that I would see on British television?

2327
03:15:49,340 --> 03:15:50,860
What's happening right now?

2328
03:15:50,860 --> 03:16:04,840
The song, too.

2329
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:05,319
The music.

2330
03:16:06,299 --> 03:16:07,340
What everybody's doing.

2331
03:16:07,340 --> 03:16:08,780
The way that everybody is and looks.

2332
03:16:08,780 --> 03:16:14,540
And special thanks to the super hot team.

2333
03:16:16,139 --> 03:16:16,860
Hash house.

2334
03:16:16,860 --> 03:16:17,420
Hash house.

2335
03:16:17,420 --> 03:16:17,899
House house.

2336
03:16:18,940 --> 03:16:19,440
Geeks.

2337
03:16:22,010 --> 03:16:22,510
Chad.

2338
03:16:23,399 --> 03:16:23,899
Ben.

2339
03:16:27,190 --> 03:16:27,690
Papa.

2340
03:16:28,149 --> 03:16:30,250
Naughty the dog.

2341
03:16:39,530 --> 03:16:40,030
Ben.

2342
03:16:40,250 --> 03:16:40,750
Ben.

2343
03:16:41,129 --> 03:16:41,629
Ben.

2344
03:16:42,870 --> 03:16:43,590
Papa Ben.

2345
03:16:44,250 --> 03:16:44,750
Ben.

2346
03:16:44,969 --> 03:16:45,469
Ben.

2347
03:16:46,010 --> 03:16:46,510
Ben.

2348
03:16:46,889 --> 03:16:48,979
I'll get it right.

2349
03:16:48,979 --> 03:17:02,069
I just got an achievement.

2350
03:17:02,069 --> 03:17:03,270
It's called Snitch.

2351
03:17:22,870 --> 03:17:23,909
I live in my house.

2352
03:17:24,870 --> 03:17:27,530
I live in my house.

2353
03:17:28,250 --> 03:17:30,180
Okay, where?

2354
03:17:30,180 --> 03:17:30,680
Right here.

2355
03:17:31,459 --> 03:17:36,340
Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.

2356
03:17:36,340 --> 03:17:36,979
Frog Detective speaking.

2357
03:17:36,979 --> 03:17:37,620
How can I help you?

2358
03:17:38,659 --> 03:17:39,940
Detective.

2359
03:17:39,940 --> 03:17:41,059
Supervisor.

2360
03:17:41,059 --> 03:17:42,100
It's me, the supervisor.

2361
03:17:42,100 --> 03:17:43,059
I am aware.

2362
03:17:43,059 --> 03:17:44,979
Great job on solving the invisible wizard mystery.

2363
03:17:44,979 --> 03:17:46,180
That was quite a head-scratcher.

2364
03:17:46,899 --> 03:17:47,399
Sure was.

2365
03:17:48,020 --> 03:17:51,819
I was shocked that the culprit was the wizard herself.

2366
03:17:52,620 --> 03:17:54,940
Yeah, the mysteries I solve are never what they seem.

2367
03:17:55,500 --> 03:17:57,579
It's always a misunderstanding or an accident.

2368
03:17:57,579 --> 03:18:00,059
No one is ever malicious on purpose in my mysteries.

2369
03:18:00,940 --> 03:18:03,180
I'm so glad that crime isn't real.

2370
03:18:06,139 --> 03:18:07,739
Didn't you get extorted earlier?

2371
03:18:09,290 --> 03:18:11,129
Yes, I think that's a crime.

2372
03:18:11,770 --> 03:18:14,469
I suppose that crime is real after all.

2373
03:18:15,030 --> 03:18:18,870
Your office is called Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.

2374
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:19,370
Yes.

2375
03:18:19,829 --> 03:18:22,069
Detective, why do you believe that crime isn't real?

2376
03:18:22,950 --> 03:18:26,260
Community Night sucks.

2377
03:18:26,260 --> 03:18:27,700
Frog Detective forever.

2378
03:18:27,700 --> 03:18:28,100
You just did...

2379
03:18:28,100 --> 03:18:28,739
We did it all.

2380
03:18:28,739 --> 03:18:30,579
We did every Frog Detective that exists.

2381
03:18:31,219 --> 03:18:32,700
But there's no more to do.

2382
03:18:32,700 --> 03:18:33,819
There's no more to do.

2383
03:18:34,459 --> 03:18:35,979
I was exaggerating.

2384
03:18:35,979 --> 03:18:37,579
Plus, despite my job title,

2385
03:18:37,579 --> 03:18:39,659
I never really seemed to be solving crimes.

2386
03:18:39,659 --> 03:18:44,500
That's going to change in a moment, I think, Detective.

2387
03:18:44,500 --> 03:18:46,090
Oh, super duper.

2388
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:48,360
Just got a call about a doozy of a case.

2389
03:18:49,239 --> 03:18:50,200
That sounds exciting.

2390
03:18:50,760 --> 03:18:53,959
It is, but it's also the most challenging case I've ever sent you on.

2391
03:18:54,600 --> 03:18:57,139
I'm confident in your abilities,

2392
03:18:57,780 --> 03:18:59,540
but you might need backup on this one.

2393
03:19:00,600 --> 03:19:01,100
Like who?

2394
03:19:01,799 --> 03:19:04,200
I'm going to send the lobster cop to help you with the case.

2395
03:19:06,440 --> 03:19:09,239
Really? Lobster cop handles such advanced cases.

2396
03:19:09,239 --> 03:19:10,360
Won't I just slow him down?

2397
03:19:11,399 --> 03:19:12,360
Nonsense, Detective.

2398
03:19:12,360 --> 03:19:15,159
You've shown you're a very capable mystery solver.

2399
03:19:15,159 --> 03:19:17,239
I think you're in the running to be the new number one.

2400
03:19:18,120 --> 03:19:19,000
You're making me blush.

2401
03:19:19,799 --> 03:19:20,680
You'll be a-okay.

2402
03:19:21,319 --> 03:19:22,809
So where am I heading next?

2403
03:19:23,450 --> 03:19:25,129
I can't say over the phone. It's too sensitive.

2404
03:19:26,329 --> 03:19:28,520
Wow. Head to the train station.

2405
03:19:28,520 --> 03:19:30,120
I've left a ticket for you there.

2406
03:19:30,120 --> 03:19:33,000
The train will take you to where you need to be.

2407
03:19:33,899 --> 03:19:35,180
Good luck. I want to meet this character.

2408
03:19:37,190 --> 03:19:37,989
Good luck, Detective.

2409
03:19:37,989 --> 03:19:39,110
Do you think you can handle it?

2410
03:19:39,110 --> 03:19:40,549
I can handle anything.

2411
03:19:40,549 --> 03:19:46,040
All right.

2412
03:19:46,040 --> 03:19:52,360
Frog Detective will return in episode three after the detective has left.

2413
03:19:53,319 --> 03:20:12,170
Is somebody breaking in the room and stealing something?

2414
03:20:12,809 --> 03:20:34,989
All right.

2415
03:20:40,469 --> 03:20:41,590
He looks like he's made of ice cream.

2416
03:20:41,590 --> 03:20:42,709
He looks like he's made of ice cream.

2417
03:20:43,670 --> 03:20:51,299
I would love to eat Frog Detective in an ice cream bar.

2418
03:20:52,659 --> 03:21:02,819
He's definitely lemon lime.

2419
03:21:03,860 --> 03:21:09,370
You know those shark bars, the shark popsicles?

2420
03:21:10,010 --> 03:21:12,090
I feel like he's a creamier version of that flavor.

2421
03:21:12,809 --> 03:21:23,959
Isn't that a character on Sesame Street?

2422
03:21:24,680 --> 03:21:37,610
The detective will return in

2423
03:21:39,049 --> 03:21:44,200
Cowboy County.

2424
03:21:44,760 --> 03:21:46,440
Corruption at Cowboy County.

2425
03:21:52,180 --> 03:21:53,940
What happened to community content night?

2426
03:21:56,280 --> 03:21:58,040
I deleted everything accidentally.

2427
03:21:58,840 --> 03:22:00,860
I just like there was a ton of it.

2428
03:22:00,860 --> 03:22:01,659
I just fucking hit.

2429
03:22:01,659 --> 03:22:04,219
I pressed the backspace button on it with everything selected.

2430
03:22:04,860 --> 03:22:05,739
Sorry.
