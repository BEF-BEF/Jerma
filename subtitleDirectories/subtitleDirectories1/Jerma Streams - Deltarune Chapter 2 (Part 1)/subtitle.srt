1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,750
Ooh, Deltarune. I got my Deltarune hat on, my Deltarune shirt on, my Deltarune clothes on, my Deltarune everything.

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:25,420
I've got my Deltarune plushies back here. I'm wearing a Star Wars t-shirt. Uh, never mind. I got a tweet. I'll be right back.

3
00:00:25,660 --> 00:01:11,480
How you doing? See you in a minute. Okay. So I want to make this really clear.

4
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,859
This is going to be, uh, for those of you that haven't played Deltarune chapter one, uh, this is gonna be a spoiler free playthrough.

5
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,340
I can respect the people that haven't done it yet. All names will be censored.

6
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:29,739
All text will be censored. And anytime there's a major, major event on the screen, I'm going to cut to, uh, to auto.

7
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,420
So I'm just, I want to, you know, make sure you guys understand.

8
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:41,340
Now I'm ready to go. I did run up here though. I'm a little winded.

9
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,620
I always open up. So I'm on my phone. I'll just take a look at the, uh,

10
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,900
the clock app.

11
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,519
And the second hand is on the six.

12
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,159
And it's just going around and I know that it's almost two.

13
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,340
And I go, oh fuck, I got to get up in that room.

14
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:06,969
And turn the stream on before the second hand hits the 12 up there.

15
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,280
I almost made it.

16
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
Very close.

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:22,360
You know, your house has two floors.

18
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,400
Five.

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:33,099
What are you talking about? It takes me about four minutes to run up and down the stairs.

20
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,449
No, I don't live in a five story house. I would never want to live in a five story house.

21
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:49,080
Have I talked about my like anxiety with living in a big house or a bigger place? It's scary. I hate it.

22
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,050
The bigger your house is,

23
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,409
the more places for a murderer to come in and like hide in your eighth bedroom

24
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,050
while you're brushing your teeth in bedroom two.

25
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,569
And you might not even fucking hear them come in. Nope. No, thanks.

26
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,539
I want to be able to be completely aware

27
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,740
of every single space in my place of residence.

28
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,199
If somebody's scratching at the door

29
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,780
20 feet away, I want to be able to fucking hear it.

30
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,639
I'm not going to be in living room four

31
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,210
and not know what's going on in living room two.

32
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,189
Paranoid. That's fine. That's all right.

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Just set up baby monitors everywhere.

34
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,099
I don't know. I don't want to play five nights at Freddy's in my own house.

35
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,360
No, I don't want to do that.

36
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,080
That's when fucking chicken's gonna jump out of my face. I don't want to do that.

37
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,939
No, I want to be very aware of my surroundings at all times.

38
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,699
Live in a four by four house.

39
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,990
Aren't you scared of ovens too?

40
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,839
I'm not scared of ovens.

41
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,839
I'm scared of how ovens operate.

42
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,019
It's weird.

43
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,019
Something about it just freaks me out. I don't know why.

44
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,449
The fact that there is a box in your house

45
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,540
that heats up to hundreds of degrees

46
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,980
with gas.

47
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,660
It's just I don't know if something about it irrationally is uncomfortable to me.

48
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,339
I don't know why.

49
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:54,519
That's a recycled bit.

50
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,519
No, no, these are not recycled bits.

51
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Hey, I can recycle a bit

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,160
when there's way more people that are here than last time I talked about the oven routine, okay?

53
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,540
Two years ago when I talked about my fear of ovens

54
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,620
like 4000 of you weren't here. So I get to do it again.

55
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,899
Every additional viewer that's added to this stream I get to redo a joke because that person hasn't heard it yet.

56
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:24,970
That was a few months ago.

57
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,410
Never mind.

58
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,579
Oops.

59
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,060
You're environmentally conscious with your jokes.

60
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:39,379
I gotta I gotta keep my joke carbon footprint down.

61
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:47,899
That was definitely more than a few months ago. I don't know. I have no idea.

62
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,209
I wonder how many words I've said on stream and on YouTube.

63
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,180
How many actually single words have I spoken?

64
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,180
You have to be talking about like tens of millions hundreds of millions of words that have been spoken into a microphone.

65
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,769
I can't keep track of them all of everything I've ever said.

66
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,100
How am I supposed to do that?

67
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
The oven routine is a recycled bit.

68
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Yeah, since the oven routine I have said

69
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,939
745 million words.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,050
Think about that.

71
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,050
Really think think about that for a second.

72
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,319
Important.

73
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,750
Somebody has to count it. I don't I hope nobody does do that. That's way that's way too much work for something.

74
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,829
So that is not important at all.

75
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,379
You see half of your words are filler.

76
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,069
Yeah, because I have so much to say that I need my brain has to catch up for a second.

77
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,790
My left hemisphere and my right hemisphere are the tortoise and the hare.

78
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,230
And they're both they're both competing at the same time.

79
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,829
Like one of them runs real fast and the other one takes like 20 minutes to get there.

80
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,420
Play the game. It's been seven minutes. We'll just I'm

81
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,699
Get out of here.

82
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,540
Play the game. I'm gonna play the game. I'm I'm excited about this one.

83
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,139
Impatient Andy.

84
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,139
Yeah, just we'll just chill. We're just hanging out.

85
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,500
Vod watchers skip.

86
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,579
Well, that's the that's the privilege of being a Vod watcher versus a live viewer.

87
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,649
A Vod watcher right now was able to go like this.

88
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,089
I put oven pipe.

89
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,170
Okay, so we're gonna play Deltarune now. Uh, we're gonna start the game now.

90
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,899
But you guys are here live.

91
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:53,220
You have to you have to put up with me in real time.

92
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,910
So I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.

93
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:10,980
I've been waiting for this. Yeah, I've I'm excited. I did my refresher course.

94
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,220
I remember everything pretty much.

95
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,160
I've seen everything I need to see.

96
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,439
I am refreshed for Deltarune chapter two, by the way, this is chapter two.

97
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,110
So if you don't know what this is, I don't know if you want to be here, but maybe you do.

98
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,639
You say wait, what is it?

99
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,600
You say one to seven words per second.

100
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,879
So that's six thousand one hundred and twenty words per hour.

101
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,419
Okay.

102
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,139
So for six hundred so six thousand one hundred and twenty words an hour.

103
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,299
times

104
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,659
like five hours.

105
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:56,019
Talking about like what? Thirty to forty thousand words, uh said.

106
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,019
On stream per stream times one thousand.

107
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,080
Is like three hundred and fifty million words or something. I don't know. Somebody will figure it out.

108
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:12,580
I say way more than one or two set. No way. I say way more than that.

109
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,690
All right, you guys ready for Deltarune chapter two?

110
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,679
You know, i'm fucked up now. Now i'm going to try to say more words a second to like bump my

111
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,759
score.

112
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:37,320
Where's my audio? Where's my audio?

113
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,580
All right, so I played this on different computers. So I on my

114
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:45,179
streaming setup is not I don't have the old files.

115
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:47,659
I'll just pretend like it's the same file.

116
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,259
But I heard I've I've everything I said you don't have to be playing in the same file. It's fine.

117
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,320
He's muted.

118
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,429
How does this work? Where's my audio? Oh shit. That's why.

119
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,200
He didn't kill.

120
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,360
Wait, hold on. Make sure everyone who cares? You're episode two. I can say it. Okay.

121
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,799
Why am I so concerned about saying this?

122
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
This is you're here at episode two.

123
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,590
I have to imply that you've seen episode one or played episode one, right?

124
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,909
Like what am I talking about? And this has been out for a week.

125
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,750
I'm always the last person on Twitch to play these games. The new ones that come out.

126
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:37,559
So I didn't play I didn't beat Jevil on this save file.

127
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,279
Oh, well.

128
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:52,490
I mean I if you didn't if you don't know I'm I'm one of I think of of six people on Twitch.

129
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,289
Or maybe six people in the world

130
00:10:55,289 --> 00:11:01,850
that beat Jevil on their first try. First try. No bullshit. Did it first try with nothing. No bullshit.

131
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,490
I'm one of six people on in I think in North America.

132
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:08,019
From my understanding.

133
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:16,100
Stream is ruined.

134
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,940
No spoilers.

135
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
All right, let's go. Let's go. I'm ready.

136
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,419
Let me start.

137
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:27,269
What was my name in the last save file? I don't remember and can anyone look it up?

138
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:36,279
What was my name?

139
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,450
I made this was my name.

140
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,850
That's such an old joke though. That's so old.

141
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,870
It's been three years and we're gonna really go back to like three years ago comedy on Twitch.

142
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,820
Hey, on emos. Thanks for the 20 subs. Appreciate it. 20 community subs.

143

Recycled joke. All right. I'm just gonna whatever. It doesn't really matter.

I'm using a controller too. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So shut up.

145
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,870
Everybody relax. I'm using a controller. I know I just like everyone just fucking spit out their dinner. Relax.

146
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:24,889
Joke recycler Andy. Okay. How about I'm just gonna do my name. Whatever. Who cares?

147
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:38,120

All right, here we go. So last thing remember

I played the sims 3 with some mods and then fuck it

163
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:25,620
I just didn't even open it ever again until the next time 20 minutes before I had to stream next

164
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh, man. Okay, you're a content creator. Yeah. Okay. Oh chris

165
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,039
Am I going to have to lock the oven again?

166
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:52,600
I don't want you to touch the oven because I don't like the oven well hurry out of bed. It's time for school

167
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Yeah, so the last

168
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,549
Chapter you go to school sit down

169
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,870
You with one of your classmates?

170
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,549
Yeah, ends up getting and you end up going into a portal in the clause in the supply closet

171
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,710
And then you have to fight the dark prince at the in the dark portal and everything

172
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:18,659
And then you come back and okay good. We get it play the game

173
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,820
No, i'm gonna milk this for like seven hours because it's i've been waiting for this

174
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:34,809
It's five dollars in your brother's drawer take it. I mean it's five dollars. It's five dollars

175
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:47,049
I'll put ten back in a week. That's the play. It's a bird cage when the door is closed

176
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:58,230
There's no escape on the computer's desktop is a folder called epic games stuff poorly drawn design for a game

177
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:09,129
Seems the last boss is a creature with giant rainbow wings. It doesn't seem like this game ever saw the light of day

178
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:32,360
Is this a unreleased game fortnight? There's no time to read books just generally. Yeah

179
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,690
That's like really that's a good point

180
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,059
How to draw dragons is at the bottom of the drawer the purple character on the cover is dressed

181
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:59,029
Immodestly, your brother will never return this book doors locked. Oh, by the way

182
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,990
I gotta say this really really importantly the backseat policy on this stream is as follows

183
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,589
If I

184
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:14,009
Request help specifically if I request help if I say I don't know what the fuck i'm doing somebody help me

185
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,130
You're free to spam whatever you want in the chat that has anything to do with what I asked

186
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
If you say a spoiler of this game

187
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:27,740
In the chat room you are going to get just nuked by the mods if there's like a put a spoiler chat gone

188
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:36,420
And you're gone too and you're never coming back. Uh, so where the fuck do I go?

189
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:40,470
What do I where do I go? I have no idea what the fuck i'm doing. Where do I go from here?

190
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:55,529
I'm in one of those fucking woods today. Yes. I am. Good luck. It's a landline phone, but you are already have a cell phone

191
00:17:55,609 --> 00:18:05,299
Okay, it's the tv. It looks like it's plugged in but it's dusty the crack stream. It might be

192
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:24,390
It's chariel the beloved living room chair. Well, shall we go to school? Right? Yeah, chris. There you are

193
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,670
Even suzy showed up before you

194
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,660
Hey chris if I knew you were gonna be late

195
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,460
I would have I wouldn't have showed up on time

196
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,210
Suzy, please don't kick your desk

197
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:50,279
Treat school property like you treat people. Okay next time i'll aim for the vitals

198
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,819
And that's not it's not what I and in any case good morning class

199
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,130
We have a lot to go over today

200
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,549
First we're starting the reading from page 142

201
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:10,359
Any volunteers?

202
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,599
Um, I I guess I could read the

203
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,579
Ah trouble yourself. Not noelle

204
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,720
I will valiantly take this blow of humiliation

205
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,279
Uh, that's okay. I I can

206
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,500
Page 142

207
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,740
It was the best of times. It was the worst of times

208
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,799
Times are pretty good times are pretty bad

209
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:39,359
Mediocre times iffy times so so times listening to this your eyes begin to close automatically

210
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,470
Three voices omega l band that guy for a week listen to this

211
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:45,789
It's going to close

212
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:59,769
Have a nice day everyone and please remember your group projects. Oh, um chris. Are you okay? You were um sleeping all class

213
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,369
Don't worry. I i'm not mad just concerned

214
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:12,960
Usually you only sleep through the start good luck in the and rest well tonight. Okay slept through class

215
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,279
How many voices you got?

216
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,039
That's always such a stupid thing

217
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:28,109
Oh, yeah, how how how many can you do and i'm not trying to do them, right?

218
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,670
Oh, you think i'm so bad at that. Uh, what do you what do you have? I don't know

219
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,890
I don't i'm not doing the thing you're doing. I'm a fucking doctor dude

220
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,039
You're an e-clown and you have three voices when you come in for a checkup at the doctor's appointment

221
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,279
I don't stick the thing up your nose and then tell you to leave and then say you have nose hairs

222
00:20:52,990 --> 00:21:02,539
I got i've got like 10 things I can diagnose on you. Actually they do

223
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,069
Wait, i'm supposed to be the reverse. Fuck. I fucked it up

224
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,509
Specialists are doctors that like there's a nose doctor, right? And all he does is look at your nose

225
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:17,279
I said it completely backwards. It was completely backwards. I meant it the other way. I've ruined everything

226
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,319
I actually meant to say it the other way if there's a nose doctor that looks only at your nose

227
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,839
So if the if you only do the nose doctor routine, it's fine

228
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,279
So if I can do one two three voices really good, that's fine because I can do them really good

229
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,430
I fucked up the whole routine. I you didn't lose sleep over it

230
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:53,470
Did you lost sleep from being susie's partner actually my sleep quality increased who is he talking to you?

231
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:06,940
Uh, what should I which one should I do the first one actually my sleep quality increased

232
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,769
I'm gonna say lost sleep from i'll do the actually my sleep my sleep quality increased. Oh chris. That's um good. I think

233
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,839
maybe you were just

234
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,400
Staying up late talking to asriel online again

235
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:28,240
Oh, wait, you can't do that, right? I hope the internet gets fixed soon. The internet doesn't work

236
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:40,250
I don't want to revert into my primal form. Oh, wait, okay

237
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:52,559
What does that mean? Well, look who it is the school zombie. He was sleeping like a corpse all class

238
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,410
What's the matter a trouble going to betty by last night?

239
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,920
Me too chris like I could sleep after yesterday

240
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,519
Just waiting for today felt like years. Did all that stuff really happen?

241
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,970

243
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,519
Everything we've been waiting for is just behind this

244
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,109
We uh open this and there's nothing inside

245
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,599

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,960
It sucks

263
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,160

If you could bring her by later, it would mean a lot to me chris. What the hell was that?

266
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,019
Why would noelle ask me to do homework with her?

267
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:17,690
That's wish much. Does she want to fail? Wait a second. Wait a second

268
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,599
Did you notice how nervous she was and like blushing and stuff or she don't think that she uh,

269
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,940
She's onto our secret identities, you know this dark world stuff. Uh, damn. We gotta keep this under wraps chris

270
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,960
This is our thing, you know, anyway enough waiting already, right?

I hope it's not that high because I love this franchise just like you just like you here. We are chris suzy

279
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:51,779
It's been ever so long

280
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:55,950
Yeah, yeah, it's been what a day. Oh, that is short, isn't it?

281
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,740
It's just that i've never had friends before

282
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,740
So i've never waited so long to see them again either fine

283
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:09,200
I guess we'll try not to let you die of loneliness. I bet lancer wants to see us too, right?

284
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,980
Hey, where is that?

285
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:22,819
Where is the lancer? Where's everybody? Don't worry not suzy. You'll see them in a moment

286
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:25,740
Just wait here. All right

287
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:33,170
Aaron, okay. Hey, this better not be some kind of prank or something first. I have something to ask you

288
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I need you to return to the light world

289
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,400
And go to the old classroom to the east of the closet doors

290
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:51,039
Inside gather everything on the ground and bring it back here. Could you go to the light world?

291
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,990
Wait, I just got here and I just not listen. Wait, this is a point

292
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:05,539
You look upon the castle you first saw yesterday. You're filled with the power of immediate nostalgia. Hey

293
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,740
file saved

294
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Cool. All right. So should I just listen?

295
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,779
Okay, go to the east of the closet door and pick up stuff. I'm just gonna do it. Whatever. I'm gonna listen

296
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,710
Are you level two? I don't know

297
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,680
Okay east of the closet door

298
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:49,170
door is locked

299
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,130
Shit

300
00:28:52,130 --> 00:29:00,400
I live on the west coast of the united states guys. I don't know it's yeah

301
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,059
It's I know listen

302
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,069
I told you I got the two hemispheres

303
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:14,289
Like the tortoise is the one that processes information and the hair is the one that makes all the stupid fucking voices you hear every day

304
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,200
Right all like the dumb things that I say is the hair running as fast as he can

305
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:26,019
The tortoise needs like extra time to even process what's happening on the screen. They're constantly in

306
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:32,849
Conflict with each other. They got the junk off the floor or doesn't do a giant dusty ball

307
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:43,039
What's in here managed to cram everything into the closet even the rug

308
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,980
Rockboard door is locked. What am I talking about? Well, you weren't here

309
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,460
Okay

310
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,059
That person was when you if you get people that saying what are you talking about weren't here 10 minutes ago

311
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,660
You can't jump halfway into like infinity war and ask who thanos is

312
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,619
Hey chris, so where is everyone?

313
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,759

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,779
Everyone's here

318
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:33,579
But what happened to lancer's castle?

319
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,819
all gone

320
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:40,509
gone

321
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:44,349
Right when chris sealed the fountain that dark world disappeared

322
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,150
And turned back into a normal classroom

323
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,579
Where's lancer gonna live now?

324
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:53,099
Don't worry, susie

325
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:59,339
We'll conquer ralsleys ralsleys ralsleys. I can't say this word in this place ralses

326
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,130
castle is our own

327
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,769
ralsleys

328
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,690
As you bring dark world denizens back here

329
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,529
Power of our fountain will transform this town more and more

330
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
From now on the enemies we spare

331
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,799
Will be recruited to our town

332
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,799
So let's keep sparing enemies. Okay?

333
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,710
Anyhow, why don't we all have a look around

334
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,710
We can head north towards the castle. I have a special surprise to show you there

335
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:35,869
Not if I surprised myself first

336
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:38,509
Last one there is a fresh and fragrant egg

337
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,539
Come on chris. You're gonna let him beat us

338
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,960
Beat us. I thought you were racing

339
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,839
Yeah, I want to be the egg

340
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:04,140
It's funny the castle town is transformed for the power of friendship. You're filled with the power of friendship based architecture

341
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:13,680
Fruits fruits now, okay

342
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:22,799
It's a manual read a topic crudes. I'm curious if you spare or pacify enough enemies of the same type. They will be recruited

343
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,059
Recruits will appear in your town

344
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:32,079
Wonder what happens if you get them all you can check the area's recruit status at save points certain bosses are excluded

345
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:40,259
Okay, interesting. Can I go on the cafe?

346
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,779
Mama amoeba I wanted to run the bakery but someone is already working there

347
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,660
A cafe that serves pastries. What a disgrace

348
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,700
What sort of humiliating thing will happen next

349
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:14,269
Check recruits a real dust bunny known to play dirty, but loves to play clean dislikes vacuums likes dusty places

350
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:18,480
Do these people join the party?

351
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,759
Are these the enemies from last chapter? Yeah, but so I can place

352
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,660
Oh, they just hang out here. That's cool place. Okay

357
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,500
Everything tastes better with a normally shaped body

358
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:33,099
Hey boss, i'll have a dark candy star fate. So they're gonna hang out here. What are your thoughts on the mario movie?

Wow, our house is a dojo makes me want to fight

370
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,420

Meanwhile, you might get a little bit tougher. We're gonna make you the strongest boss

378
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:41,440
Learn how to spare like a champ jigsaw joe

You can act and spare on the same turn if you know chris's act will give an enemy 100 mercy

382
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,170
Spare them on the same turn with suzy or ralsei

383
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:08,269
Jigsaw joe jigs in okay

384
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:10,960
So this is chris

385
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960

00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,820
shave

389
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,090
Jigsaw joe jigs in okay, and then

390
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,570
spare jigsaw joe

391
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:29,179
Okay, and then what about you magic or should I try spare?

392
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,170
See what happens you shave jigsaw joe's stubble

393
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
Suzy spared jigsaw joe

394
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,860
Rousey spared jigsaw joe. Oh boss, you're sparing me

395
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Wait a second. I got something else to remind you of

396
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,840
boss

397
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
It works the same with making an enemy tired

398
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,929
If an act will make an enemy tired use ralsei's pacify right away

399
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,489
Of course pacify is magic. So you'll need tp

400
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,289
Spend a turn defending to gain tp if you have to boss

401
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,940
Okay, looks like you could use a bedtime story. So we're uh

402
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,400
we're gonna do act or

403
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,960
Jigsaw joe sleepy story

00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:17,170
Jigsaw joe looks like you could use a bedtime story and then we're gonna do um pacify right? Oh, wait. No

Oh, no, you're gonna okay sleepy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you can't yeah. I don't we don't need tp to do that

410
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:39,300
Oh, it's an act. Okay. I thought we needed tp for some reason

411
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:49,730
All right came she came tired and then ralsei cast pacify and you're done

412
00:38:50,369 --> 00:39:03,059
You managed to spare enemies right away battles will go a lot faster. Okay. Here's your reward my entire life savings

413
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:16,269
One dollar. All right, let's see. Should I do another one raise challenge one get 100 tp without getting hit

414
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:23,300
Uh, these are like challenges. We're gonna do this later. I'm battles master. Ask me about battles

415
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:30,019
Raising hitbox nothing. I think I remember a lot of this stuff grazing is if a projectile comes really close

416
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,699
But doesn't touch you you get like something for it right tp or something

417
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,949
It's whole

418
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:41,230
We failed to hit our funding goal. I will not talk about our whole

419
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:48,880
Okay, what thoughts aren't always as they appear?

420
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:55,599
The bigger they are the less to fear you'll only get hurt a little inside take your pride and learn the size

421
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,659
Everybody said you're gonna get 12 hours out of this at your pace

422
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
i'm not like

423
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:14,260
I'm i'm one of them i'm doing what I want when shots aim directly try to move slow

424
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:17,059
Yeah, because if it almost hits you, yeah

425
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:26,289
Move it bit by bit. You'll gain tp. That's what it is. I'm taking i'm gonna take my time. I'm i'm excited for this

426
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:30,940
I love undertale. That was a great series. It's a really cool game

427
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,780
So and I like delta runes the first chapter so i'm going to enjoy the second chapter

428
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,340
That means i'm not going to a a a a a a a to get through this as fast as I can

429
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:47,539
I'm going to talk to townspeople. I'm sorry. That's how it is. But just a block with a shop. What's in here?

430
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,579
Welcome travelers

431
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:54,739

Okay, cool. Let's talk. So we're now in the castle town

434
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,969
Well now it makes no difference to me as long as I stay in my shop these walls won't change

435
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,110
You don't have your jevil item

436
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:19,570
No, I don't well

437
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,690
In a way, I suppose it's just a little bit amusing to see you again. I'm sure you three will have an interesting journey

438
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:28,369
Me i'll just be here offering the same old junk

439
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,130
As you find stronger treasure, i'm sure you'll have a little reason to return here

440
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:36,349
If you have some time i'll offer you a biscuit and a hint

441
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,210
Have a hint the little prince has something to show you in his castle

442
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,010
Well, now are you going to turn down a royal invitation?

443
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,099
He again

444
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:53,949
Okay

00:41:53,949 --> 00:42:06,210
Cool. Talk to you. I talk to you. Oh wow has transplanted this to the thine castle town. I already talked to you already

446
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:29,019
Oh, it's quite a wonderful town. Really. Thank you. So why am I alone here a bit of self-reflection? I suppose

447
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,579
I do realize I was quite a coward before

448
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,699
So I wanted to say well

449
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,239
I still am

450
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,039
My cards I cannot handle society but now i'll be living at the top of this cliff

451
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,300
When i'm ready to meet society again, I will be back

452
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:58,349
Thank you. Thank you for the wonderful home. I will not use it. There's a hole in the wall. There's nothing inside

453
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:20,590
What about this side? I love this character this character right here. I want to recruit this person. Mr

454
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:27,199
Society left didn't he? Hmm. I reckon I knew this would happen. It's not a no fault of yours

455
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:36,380
Yeah, i'll be back one day without trees

456
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:44,960
I must gain nutrients by eating clothes such as the way of the worm looks like the clothes are nibbled take a bite

457
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:50,239
Yes, you put your mouth against the mannequin's cheek

458
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:53,659
chris

459
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:55,500
Don't bother it tastes awful

460
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
And sushi did it too

461
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:05,650
I like being like this

462
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,010
Don't tell anybody

463
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:20,110
This seems to be locked may never open again. Oh, this is okay. I know what that is. That's my favorite character

464
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:33,440
All right, I explored the town a little bit save it. Let's go continue on

465
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:43,099
Dragged out playthrough of delta rune chapter two. Look i'm gonna screw up a few times. Whatever i'll learn

466
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,260
We'll do we'll just get back in the swing of things here. All right, here we go

467
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,389
This is a bit scary moving to a new place. But as a ball

468
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:55,519
There's nothing to sphere except sphere itself. I missed the bakery. I tried to go

469
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,460
I thought I tried to go in the bakery and I go in there

470
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,460
Yeah, I i'm gonna have i'm gonna have to get very upset with chat here for a second

471
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:14,050
If I said that if we just saw the ball character and I said there's nothing to sphere but sphere itself

472
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:22,750
Half of you would want me to turn the stream off. That's not fair. Oh, I am chef lancer

473
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,250
Try my delicious hand-formed cookies

474
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:30,539
They're free here for a price. What's the price zero dollars?

475

504
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:53,539
We

00:48:53,539 --> 00:49:02,909

506
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,780

507
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:13,699

00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,900
Cool spike bed now I can stab myself during the night

547
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:35,460

00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,150
Iron cones chalk

00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,190
Moss jars of salsa pieces of ice

551
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,989
Black crumbs from the toaster jaw breakers

552
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:53,389
Oh and like actual food too the clothes draw full of spiky and dangerous clothing

553
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:56,269
All the clothes are ripping each other up into shreds

554
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,150
Hell, yeah jealous chris

555
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:05,710
Susie you didn't get to read the manual so I put it over here for you

556
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:09,170
Cool. I'll read it before bed. That'll put me to sleep

557
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:11,150
Let's go

558
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:16,960
I want to see my room

559
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,920
It's your bed feels incredibly soft like sleeping on a dream

560
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:25,550
It's a stand for your manual. I thought you might want to keep it here in case you want to read it

561
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,119
This is the manual

562
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:36,139
Okay, it's a shelf all sorts of keepsakes could be but there might be hidden items here

563
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:38,909
It's a wardrobe full of all sorts of different clothes

564
00:53:39,739 --> 00:53:45,059
Wear whatever you want nice. I think that deserves a coffee chug

565
00:53:53,710 --> 00:54:01,889
Cool. This is lancer's room lancer. You aren't gonna believe how sick my room is

I even have my own bed now. I don't have to sleep in a hole anymore. I thought you already had a bed

572
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,789

I have to change

575
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:48,369
You know, is it not canonically in your head? It's not like a kind of low but goofy kind of voice. We hate this voice

576
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,010
Is it as bad?

577
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,630

Miss toriel is written in cursive on the dry erase board seems like it hasn't been erased in a very long time

640
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:48,019
You uncapped the scented green marker. It's almost dry, but that gives it a refined aged apple bouquet

641
01:00:48,260 --> 01:01:05,579
The poster of several basic shapes circle oval square paper dose to chadron kids book

642
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:11,780
Some of them used to be yours marker sniffer. It's an orange

643
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:19,460
It's unknown if it's safe for teachers to eat this groan of the gods it grows higher. Is this hubris?

644
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:29,230
Okay, cool. What's on the computer? Computer wallpaper is updated. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait

645
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:34,739
Do it again. Do it again. I missed it picture of your brother and you playing video games

646
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:39,900
Your brother is using the knockoff controller. Yeah, that was me

647
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:47,360
Mm-hmm, but here's the one thing about that knockoff controller that us little brothers in the chat will remember

648
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:52,179
Uh, some of those had a turbo feature and uh, yeah

649
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,840
Being able to shoot whatever the weapon I was shooting at five million miles a second while my brother was kind of annoyed by it

650
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:03,599
Turned out okay to me turn the turbo on hold x turn the turbo on hold y

651
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:11,539
Yep

652
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:21,739
It was a little switch on the front or back of the controller, right? Hold on. Are you ready for the sadie?

653
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:31,250
Hawkman's dance at this dance all the chaperones wear giant hawk heads and screech at any students that make contact while dancing

654
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:42,880
Okay, let's go. I check everything. I know this is how I play rpgs

655
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:57,230
There's so much to see the band practice

656
01:02:57,309 --> 01:03:00,110
This is this is what it sounds like right before a band starts to play

657
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:23,599
Well, okay am I was just directing traffic as normal when a little dog drove one of these toy cars

658
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:29,679
Into the middle of the street and started doing donuts in the chaos all the cars in town got jammed up

659
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:37,059
Thankfully, no one was hurt but ordinary citizens like you got to get out of here

660
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,829
I've got some heavy lifting to do every time I see that face

661
01:03:40,829 --> 01:03:46,639
I have to do a different I have to get a little weird don't interrupt me when i'm lifting

662
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:55,090
I heard a dog was doing donuts so I sped over here

663
01:03:55,329 --> 01:03:59,699
But I just learned donuts is actually the name of a special attack for cars

664
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:07,969
Is my life stuck in a loop of doughy disappointment graphics moving at a snail's pace?

665
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:25,550
I love snails today get any better looks like a car looks like a car. Well, I can't go anywhere. All right, we're here

666
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:29,230
School god damn project

667
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,239
Looks god damn crazy about them

668
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,030
Hey chris, where the hell is everybody?

669
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:46,079
Something seems kind of off

670
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:55,119
Screw it. Let's just go play space pinball in the computer lab. Wait, it's another one of these

671
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,289
huh

672
01:04:58,289 --> 01:05:04,219
It's like the inside of the closet chris. You don't think this could be

673
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:13,280
Another dark world. Well

674
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,840
I guess this means we can't start our project

675
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:21,420
Unless you know chris if there's a dark fountain in there

676
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,730
You can seal it

677
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:25,730
It'll turn back into the computer lab, right?

678
01:05:27,309 --> 01:05:29,309
So what's it gonna be chris?

679
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:33,860
Let's go. Let's go. We can just use the computer in my house

680
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:48,340
I mean this one's the that's the boring answer. Let's go. Let's do I have to say it

681
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:51,039
Let's say it the way like loud

682
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,639
Okay, do you want me to say it like 12 year old xbox live loud?

683
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,730
Or 36 year old man loud which one?

684
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,889
Okay, 12 12 i'm seeing a lot of it

01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:13,570
All right

686
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:18,159
Let's go

687
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:20,179
Yeah, let's just drop the act

688
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:22,179
Our last adventure was great, right?

689
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:28,530
I couldn't stop thinking about having another

690
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:33,059
I don't know what's in there, but

691
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,949
Can't live if we don't find out right?

692
01:06:36,829 --> 01:06:45,570
Come on chris

693
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:48,130
So is this gonna be the same place or is it gonna be like a different?

694
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,500
Multiverse or something. I wonder

695
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,719
This is new

696
01:06:54,719 --> 01:07:00,960
This is new. So what the heck's going on here?

697
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:10,860

698
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,449

702
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:43,739
All right. I get it. Let's plug anything in

703
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:48,269

Cool that you're here. Just uh, like get out of here before it's too late

711
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:38,689
Noelle

712
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:39,890
Fuck that

713
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:51,140
Hell of a study session

714
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:55,630
Who the hell are you?

715
01:08:55,630 --> 01:09:01,390
I am known as serial number q5u for ex7 yy2 e9l

716
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,189
But you foolish children may call me

717
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,979
queen

718
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,979
Like you're gonna call you queen

719
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:17,729
Q five three, I don't know queen

720
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:22,060
Well, look queen. We're not children

721
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:27,489
Teens are merely big children and adults are even bigger children

722
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:31,569
Doesn't that make you a child too then?

723
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:34,739
No, I am a computer smart

724
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,590
computer

725
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:41,390
Well, thank you for the stimuli, but I must leave now. Goodbye

726
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,939
Hey, where are you going? Why'd you capture noelle?

727
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,460
Oh, I would have captured you too, but I ran out of cages

728
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,670
Why the capturing?

729
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,229
So that she may become my willing peon

730
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:00,449
In my quest for world domination

731
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:05,149
Also, maybe I will make her face into a robot one. I who knows I could

732
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:08,319
Wait, why?

733
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,010
Seems cool

734
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,609
Well, forget it, dude

735
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,260
Nobody's turning anyone's face into a robot

736
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:19,810
Could that be a statement of animus dissension?

737
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:22,289
Huh?

738
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:25,670
You want to fight loser?

739
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:29,000
Yes. Yes already. Yes

740
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,840
Oh, then bye

741
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,079
Wait, what? Wait a second

742
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:35,079
I have no time for such frivolities

743
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,960
And would kick your ass in a second

744
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,840
Perhaps someone else could entertain you

745
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:49,079
Enjoy your assimilation

746
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
We're wires swung in

747
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:58,069
Okay, they're tired. They're already tired

748
01:10:58,949 --> 01:11:00,069
so

749
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:03,270
and I do

750
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:06,869
Row wire jiggle jiggle might try to pull the wire off the head

751
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:10,390
Row what toss christophe free wire? Yeah

752
01:11:12,819 --> 01:11:18,420
What the fuck press y to throw an aim for the weak point? Oh, I can get them both

753
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:20,979
The wire greatly loosened. Okay, cool

754
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,130
That's 50. All right, almost there

755
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:32,979
All right. Oh, I was gonna say don't act like I don't know what to do

756
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:35,220
All right, let's do it again

757
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,609
Okay, uh throw wire. Let's try this again

758
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:44,930
So are they ready?

759
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,609
That's 50 percent, right?

760
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:58,840
All right spare

761
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,800
You're ready to go

762
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,800
And can we spare them both? Probably not. No

763
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:08,279
No, we can only spare them just one

764
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:13,729
Spare the where wire recruit. Oh, I've recruited right right right suzy spared where wire but its name wasn't yellow

765
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:20,239
Try using x

766
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:26,760
Oh shit

767
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,520
Yeah god gamer alert

768
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,279
Those you that by the way, I have to really make this really really really important note to everybody here

769
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,159
I'm bad at a lot of things very bad

770
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:40,119
Um, you put me in like call of duty whatever i'm gonna get like fucking zero and 20 during the game, right?

771
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,600
I sometimes I get lost. I don't know east from west

772
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:48,359
But you watch this shit and after this fucking stream. I want to hear you talk about how I what I can and cannot do

773
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,199
Okay

774
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,649
Good. I want to hear what do you think? I can and cannot do after this

775
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,289
After the well after this part

776
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,399
He can't reach the cookie jar fucking ban that guy

777
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,640
See what are you talking about?

778
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,640
Oh my god. All right. That's that was

779
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:26,239

Okay. Now i'm fucked up now. You got me fucked up. You got me fucked up you do

784
01:13:42,369 --> 01:13:48,229
This is why you never call a home run. I don't know how people did that shit

785
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:53,439
Like when babe ruth used to like get his ass up to the plate and like hold the bat up

786
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,479
It's just like holy shit, dude. What if you just strike out right now? You look like a dickhead

787
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:04,000
I'll get it right now

788
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,880
imagine calling a home run and the pitcher like

789
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Just strikes you out in three pitches

790
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:16,050
That probably happened to all the time. There was no there was no television to see that

791
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:22,359
And how come people don't do that anymore don't you think it'd be funny?

792
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,960
It would be all over sports center

793
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,760
All right. I'm not gonna stop fucking around spare

794
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,510

Or not wait they calm down

798
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,739
I just used my pacify spell to put them into sleep mode

799
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:08,850
Rousey you're here. I felt a dark presence and hurried over it seems that a new dark fountain has appeared

800
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:12,050
Rousey they got noelle

801
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:17,270
Damn, what was she thinking messing in our dark world? We don't do something. She might be

802
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:21,750
Hurry not suzy. All we have to do is seal the fountain

803
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you'd be mad about another adventure right come on chris

804
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:37,329

01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:49,649
What's going on? Do I have to touch those touch them?

807
01:15:50,369 --> 01:15:53,170

808
01:15:53,890 --> 01:16:05,430

811
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,340
You're filled with the power of a new adventure

01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:52,609

You opened the treasure chest inside was a glow wrist low wrist was added to your armors. Ooh

01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:52,220
cuteness

841
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:58,779
Amber card thin square charm that sticks to you increases defense. What about what's a glow wrist? Who should have the defense probably chris

842
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:03,229
Everyone else just has that wait white ribbon

843
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:06,510
Crinkly hair ribbon that slightly increases your defense. Is amber card better? No

844
01:19:09,939 --> 01:19:13,140
That is so behind compared to the stream refresh really

845
01:19:13,779 --> 01:19:24,609
All right, I don't want to miss anything

Whoa. All right. Well now what?

849
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,960

Oh, yeah, I do. Okay. I thought I had to collect them with different characters

01:20:03,229 --> 01:20:15,789
All right. Well, here we go. Here comes a good good. You know what it is. Oh

854
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:45,420
Fuck I get this but I don't get it somehow at the same time

855
01:20:46,960 --> 01:21:01,520
Certain characters have to touch them because they're different. They're different colored look. Oh chris. It's a free

856
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:04,479
Edible cyberpedia

857
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:06,960
I'll add an entry

858
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,399
I'll see you brought an article about losing recruits. Would you like to read it?

859
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:13,039
Sure

860
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:16,239
From now on defeating enemies with violence will make them lost

861
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,659
Lost enemies can't become recruits ever again

862
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,140
The bonds you break may make you stronger

863
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:26,819
And so if you kill people they're gone

864
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,060
I'm gonna try to spare as many people as I can

865
01:21:29,699 --> 01:21:36,020
Lighteners

866
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,020
I haven't seen many of you recently

867
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:41,699
If you didn't know an evil ruler is taking over this world

868
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:45,460
I don't really like politics. So I have no opinion on this

869
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:49,119
If you tried it too, oh, I said something

870
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,560
I've missed that we will have no choice but to cross swords

871
01:21:53,840 --> 01:22:01,409
I'm gonna say it again. If you try to talk to me about politics, we will have no choice but to cross swords

872
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:08,920
Oh shit

873
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,140
caskeys

874
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,029
Crossed your path

875
01:22:12,029 --> 01:22:14,289
All right, what we got?

876
01:22:14,289 --> 01:22:17,729

Rude buster. No check and defend. I don't want to swing the sword

881
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:35,859
Okay, here we go. Uh

882
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:40,189
Pacify I can't do that eel prayer. All right, we're gonna defend

883
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,810

884
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,779

It's just a cat

892
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,380
Yeah

893
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:20,739
All right. Let's uh, we can't spare

894
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,659
But we can act

895
01:23:22,659 --> 01:23:24,960
Let's do another roar

896
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,319

We didn't have to hurt anything. I gotta check up here

904
01:24:09,649 --> 01:24:11,649
Leave no stone untouched

905
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,680
Recently something called internet is having an outage

906
01:24:18,699 --> 01:24:21,180
Some say it was the secret to queen's know-how

907
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:24,770
Since then it seems like she's become quite extreme

908
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:37,260
Unturned not untouched

909
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:42,619
Become my willing peon and I will free you

910
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:46,689

911
01:24:48,659 --> 01:24:50,020

No, it's everything else. That's scary

914
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:58,350
Please abort your sadness protocol

915
01:24:58,909 --> 01:25:01,149

Oh well

922
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:31,750
Wait, it is quite troubling a peon must be willing to assist me in world domination

923
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:35,649
If only she had follow peons to encourage her

924
01:25:38,109 --> 01:25:40,500

932
01:25:54,250 --> 01:26:07,659
necessitated

933
01:26:07,659 --> 01:26:11,100
giant arcade game

934
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,020
I shall humiliate you at a simple children's diversion

935
01:26:16,029 --> 01:26:18,029
With your self-esteem eradicated

936
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,750
There will be no choice but to serve me

937
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:25,260

01:26:50,909 --> 01:26:53,229
Oh chris congratulations on losing horribly

943

Okay, you tried to use the arcade machine

947
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:12,210
You weren't tall or strong enough to use the controls

948
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:17,890
That's why self-esteem eradication complete

949
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:20,609

Should I let uh, is this is this pacifist if I do it in a video game?

974
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:12,619
Oh duck. Oh shit. I don't have to do it more than once

976
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:39,789
Yeah, I thought you could beat us. Why that was actually quite amusing

977
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,140
New life forms have exceeded my expectations

978
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,720
I will offer you a new exceedingly benevolent compromise

979
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,880

And there is only a 50% chance. I will reprogram your face

983
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,260
or

01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:03,060

I heard there's a rebel team resisting queen

999
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,159

01:31:25,819 --> 01:31:29,340
Why don't you take a break and grab a snack?

1009
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:47,470
Why do they do that ad campaign? I don't understand

1010
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:51,420
Old material don't care

01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:46,050
Peanuts are easier to carry

1026
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:48,210
They can fit in a little bag. They're dry

1027
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:51,789
You just eat peanuts

1028
01:32:51,789 --> 01:32:55,710
You don't need to eat the chocolate nougat and what other junk they put in there

1029
01:32:56,350 --> 01:33:01,550
Just have trail mix in your pocket. Why would you eat a snickers when you're hungry?

You were crushed under the weight of 400 bagels and defeated instantly. Wait, what?

1045
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:00,050
Not really. You just can't carry that man

01:34:36,619 --> 01:34:43,460
We tried to call on the cell phone

1055
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:46,720
I missed an area

1056
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,880
What the fuck was that? It's nothing but garbage noise

1057
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:55,149
Cuisine is so unrefined out here in the

1058
01:34:55,869 --> 01:34:59,060

1059
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:03,279

1091
01:37:04,779 --> 01:37:09,279
Anything else to say newbert that's newbert's treasure

Remember you're just borrowing it forever. I like that guy. Okay. Well, what do you have to say?

01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,880
Recently something called internet is having oh, yeah the internet

01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:43,359
Zero not bad for a beginner

1105
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,920

01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:28,079
There there. It's okay little kitty

1117

01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,390
Eight bits. All right, let's spare

01:39:49,409 --> 01:39:51,409

But we're gonna give you one to everybody if we can

1127
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:30,079
What's going on here

1128

Seems to be stuck

1129
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,260
Can I help?

1130
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:37,779
I don't think I can help

1131
01:40:37,779 --> 01:40:40,180
If you don't finish this today, you're gonna finish it tomorrow. Yes

1132
01:40:41,729 --> 01:40:43,810
Plan was if this didn't take me too long

1133
01:40:44,369 --> 01:40:46,670
I was going to play the umbrella game

1134
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:49,949
But if i'm just kind of pacing myself through the game, we'll do it tomorrow

1135
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:54,210
All right, this is locked up. It appears to be some kind of force field

1136
01:40:54,850 --> 01:41:00,220

All right act take care x or take care. I will take care x

Everyone treated the enemy with tender loving care. All the enemies felt great

01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:49,329
I think this is contagious

1150
01:41:49,329 --> 01:41:56,300
Okay, it looks healthy

1151
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,739

Thank you for agreeing to this p on release form

1170
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:44,720
Now you are all legally my minions and I can use your likeness for funny statues

1171
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:48,000
But we just don't do what you say

1172
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:51,199
In that case, I would be forced to use another guy probably

1173
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,670
I better get started on that then

1174
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:57,329
Okay, but i'm still going to use your likeness

1175
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:04,449
What did I get for that? Where's my trinket?

1176
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:06,800
Can I get a trinket?

1177
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,869
Where's my trinkets? I didn't get anything for that

1178
01:44:11,899 --> 01:44:15,300
What I disagree to all

1179
01:44:18,659 --> 01:44:27,069
Well shit, I want to recruit you got a check mark

1180
01:44:28,399 --> 01:44:30,399
Oh

01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,460
No, oh no, he didn't

1184
01:44:52,779 --> 01:44:57,420
All right, so four out of four

1185
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:58,380
You won

1186
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:05,699
So what is it? I got four to four. All right. Well, what if I go up here?

1187
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:10,220
There's a hole in the area. I did not explore. So

1188
01:45:10,939 --> 01:45:12,819
How's this work?

1189
01:45:12,819 --> 01:45:14,819
Yeah, good luck figuring out which ride to take

1190
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:23,180
It's right ride is the right one

1191
01:45:25,789 --> 01:45:46,340
Uh the analog i'm using i'm using a controller

1192
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:50,220
Oh, i'm gonna get i'm using an analog controller. It's weird

1193
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:53,729

01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:16,770
Oh a blue check mark. How can only one of them be right?

1196
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:24,770
They're testing every one of them

1197
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:26,770
Oh shit. No, I wanted the other one

1198
01:46:27,409 --> 01:46:42,239
It's probably a chest

1199
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:47,649
Wait, what I don't

1200
01:46:47,649 --> 01:46:53,539
Is this progression?

1201
01:46:53,539 --> 01:46:55,060
That other one goes up

1202
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:58,939
I'm going this way

1203
01:46:58,939 --> 01:47:08,670

So that's three check marks. Let's go turn it in

1241
01:50:17,649 --> 01:50:21,569
Found three check marks elite. I will now live in your city

1242
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:25,970
Maybe our cyber path will cyber cross once more in queen's mansion

1243
01:50:26,689 --> 01:50:30,210
In the meantime, let me show you the power up of the blue check marks

1244
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:43,869
Wow, you made fireworks

1245

Beautiful. You got verified on twitter

Very nice. I just wanted to make a cool demo scene for you now that I finished this I can show up all sorts of places

1248
01:51:04,369 --> 01:51:08,159
Okay

1249
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:10,659
Very nice

1250
01:51:10,659 --> 01:51:15,630
Well, thanks. All right this one this place. I didn't go

1251
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:17,949
I didn't go up here

1252
01:51:17,949 --> 01:51:19,949
I feel like I didn't go somewhere over here, too

1253
01:51:19,949 --> 01:51:23,659
Oh, can I go up from there?

1254
01:51:23,659 --> 01:51:34,859
It appears to be some kind of force field. No

1255
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:57,500
I don't want to fight you. Oh wait, I gotta go up from there and then progression is the one on the left

1256
01:51:57,579 --> 01:52:03,460
All right one on the right

1257
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:15,100
Okay

1258
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:33,039
Okay, I don't like that. He's gonna drop something on me. We're gonna drop the cages on us. I told you this is gonna be wild

1259
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:40,180
You guys want a tip?

1260
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:43,659
Always stand in the middle. Whoops. I didn't do my own tip

1261
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,739
There's more this is bigger. Oh shit

1262
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:58,300

01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,300
All right. What's the deal twerp?

1264
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:05,890
Who's a twerp a name sweet? Oh like sweet like sweets

1265
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:09,939
Don't tell me you haven't heard of the sweet captain cakes

1266
01:53:10,979 --> 01:53:14,210
Doesn't ring a bell

1267
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:16,210
I guess our acts still a bit underground

1268
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:20,449
Sweet captain cakes. Not only are we cyberfield's best musical trio

1269
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:24,609
We're also the last resistance against a big bad queen and all her crew

1270
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:28,699
That starts with you

1271
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:33,039
What we're fighting the queen too

1272
01:53:33,659 --> 01:53:36,539
No, uh captain saw you help her kidnap some girl

1273
01:53:37,659 --> 01:53:39,659
Hey, hey, hey cap

1274
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:43,699
We won't let anyone lay a finger on the mademoiselles

1275
01:53:45,489 --> 01:53:47,649
Except us that's not the point captain

1276
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:52,829
It's like half the point 60 55. We're rebels not players

1277
01:53:53,869 --> 01:53:56,189
We're rebels that play we don't play we don't play

1278
01:53:56,989 --> 01:53:58,109
That's it

1279
01:53:58,109 --> 01:53:59,069
Okay

1280
01:53:59,069 --> 01:54:01,710
Get over here. Okay. I don't who's this

1281
01:54:03,539 --> 01:54:05,539
Okay. Okay. Are we players?

1282
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:15,729
I'm a cd player

1283
01:54:15,729 --> 01:54:18,189
Wait, they're getting away

1284
01:54:18,189 --> 01:54:21,710
Sweet chill there'll be other bad guys. No, this is our chance

1285
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:28,260
Are you ready? Let's fight

1286
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:29,460
Okay

1287
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:32,020
Yeah, play some battle music

1288
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:35,420
Okay

1289
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:37,420
Sweet captain cakes blocks your way

1290
01:54:40,449 --> 01:54:42,210
Okay, not dancing

1291
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:45,409
All right, sweet kk and captain

1292
01:54:47,729 --> 01:54:52,579
Not currently dancing i'm gonna have to say let's go with sweet. Let's do a check

1293
01:54:53,539 --> 01:54:55,859
Maybe just start dancing. All right, let's do dance x

1294
01:54:56,819 --> 01:54:59,619
Everyone danced with sweet. They're totally lost in the groove

1295
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:02,819
Hey, I love this song ring-a-ding-dong

1296
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:04,659
Isn't this mix?

1297
01:55:04,659 --> 01:55:06,579
shway

1298
01:55:06,579 --> 01:55:17,119
After if we can get them all to dance we can win

1299
01:55:18,210 --> 01:55:20,210
All right. So that is a swede's dancing

1300
01:55:20,369 --> 01:55:23,569
Let's just do the same thing. Let's do

1301
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:26,210
Hey kates dance

1302
01:55:26,369 --> 01:55:29,300
Everyone dance with kk. They're totally lost in the group

1303
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:36,739
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right dance dance. Everybody dance. Hey, I love this song

1304
01:55:37,539 --> 01:55:48,909
I'm gonna watch over the baseballs up top. All right sweet snapped out of the dance. Oh, oh shit

1305
01:55:49,630 --> 01:55:51,630
Wait, wait, I can't dance with bad guys

1306
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:55,180
All right, so we have to do

1307
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:57,020
Just the regular dance

1308
01:55:57,020 --> 01:56:01,100
Because then yeah

1309
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,100
No, not rude damage

1310
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:21,140
Shit because once somebody has it the other one breaks out. Let's see what happens if I do the regular dance you dance

1311
01:56:21,699 --> 01:56:23,699
So we got lost in the groove

1312
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:26,500
Dance dance dance do they pay the venue fee?

1313
01:56:27,619 --> 01:56:43,300
Okay, it snapped out of it. Wait, I can't dance with bad guys. I've got my next dance moves. Okay, so nobody's dancing

1314
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:49,600
Shit

1315
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:50,720
All right

1316
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:53,920
Maybe making one of them dance will make the other ones dance. Let's try that

1317
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:57,779
Let's do the cap

1318
01:56:57,779 --> 01:56:59,949
dance extreme

1319
01:56:59,949 --> 01:57:02,109
Everyone dance with cap and they're totally lost in the group

1320
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:15,010
Wait, you want to see my move?

1321
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:17,680
Hey, is this really working?

1322
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:19,680
maybe if chris, um

1323
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:22,239
Maybe if we tried ballroom dancing instead

1324
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:25,659
Hey, why the hell do we need chris to act?

1325
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,720
Because that's um chris's unique talent

1326
01:57:29,619 --> 01:57:30,819
so

1327
01:57:30,819 --> 01:57:33,119
You think i'm too stupid to dance by myself?

1328
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:37,680
Susie learned s action. She can act from her magic menu. Okay

1329
01:57:39,539 --> 01:57:41,539
Susie, I don't think you should

1330
01:57:41,699 --> 01:57:44,689
Happy feet dumbass

1331
01:57:44,689 --> 01:57:48,930

I gotta watch out probably. Yep. Well, why are they still doing this? We're friends

1360
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:12,979
Oh, no, we're fine. Oh the hacker is hacking the fireworks

1361
02:00:13,619 --> 02:00:20,989
I'm not gonna run through this i'm gonna wait

1362
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:34,880

Very cool

1366
02:00:49,979 --> 02:00:54,460
What what's that tweet that that thing that somebody said before like a year or two ago?

1367
02:00:55,579 --> 02:01:00,960
This stream is just me. It's as if i'm talking to like a room full of just angry chimpanzees

1368
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:06,619
That at the turn of a moment could just lash out and try to attack and kill me. What is it? What was it?

1369
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:13,520
That's like this whole stream or something. It's like i'm trying desperately to like calm a bunch of like angry chimpanzees

1370
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:17,819
What was it? What was it called? Somebody's got it somewhere

1371
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:25,699
I want the I want the whole paragraph

1372
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:37,180
Snarl

1373
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:39,899
That's pretty much it. Just keep standing there

1374
02:01:42,909 --> 02:01:45,470
Hey, somebody pull up a two-year-old tweet right now

1375
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:52,460
Oh, no links are banned right forever if we go

1376
02:01:54,640 --> 02:02:00,880
Oh here it is. Okay. Jerma talks to his chat like they're apes with a very loose grasp on human language

1377
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:03,680
And if he fails they will rip him to shreds

1378
02:02:04,399 --> 02:02:09,710
Jerma talks to his chat like they're apes with a very loose grasp of human language

1379
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:21,600
That's so funny

1380
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:29,859
All right, is this the shop? It's a lone door frame, but for some reason you can't see through it

1381
02:02:36,189 --> 02:02:43,539
Oh, here's the shop. I heard this unassuming store is the rebel base, but I realized I don't really know how I would help them

1382
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:50,220
It's uh, i'm sitting here going

1383
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:53,630
Okay, guys. Look at me. Look at me

Okay, so I was at the store yesterday and uh, I got it I got a dunkin donuts large iced coffee

1385
02:03:05,539 --> 02:03:06,909

02:03:06,909 --> 02:03:12,289
And dude, i'm telling you it was fucking gross. It was the grossest coffee i've ever had in my life. It was disgusting

1387
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:20,000
I don't I don't know where um, I don't know why I can't see the thing on the screen

1388
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:21,920
I have no idea where it is

1389
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:24,800
I'm not gonna do that though. I don't know where it is. I'm not gonna do it. I'm gonna move on

1390
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:32,350
I i'm gonna move on. I don't i'm not gonna do it. I don't know where it is on the screen. I can't see it

1391
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:34,750
Uh, so i'm just gonna be done

1392
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:40,699
All right, i'm going back. I'll go back. I'll go back. I don't know. Where is it? Where is it?

1393
02:03:41,659 --> 02:03:47,760
Okay, I I can't see it I have no idea where the fuck it is

1394
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,760
Um, but you guys have fucking gaslighting the shit out of me

1395
02:03:50,399 --> 02:03:54,479
Stop i'm not I don't care. I'm not gonna do it. All right, i'll do it right now. I'll do it

1396
02:04:13,699 --> 02:04:15,380
Tearing apart

1397
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:19,300
No, I told you I was gonna go back. I couldn't see what you were looking at

1398
02:04:21,310 --> 02:04:25,619
Get off me. There's so many of you. Hold on. Uh, this is important

1399
02:04:41,779 --> 02:04:45,180
Oh, hey guys

02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:51,180
Hey, you ever you ever pick up the phone and somebody it's it's a wrong number and you say oh hey wrong number

02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:53,340
Hey, uh screw you buddy

1402
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:55,819
You know what I mean? Like that's plus two

1403
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:30,539
I wonder if your neighbors can hear you monkey laugh track. Yo, what's up? Hey

1404
02:05:35,710 --> 02:05:41,659
My neighbors, why is this person doing this for more than 10 seconds?

1405
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:46,539
That's way too long to do a monkey like chimpanzee impression

1406
02:05:49,539 --> 02:05:53,619
Right, that's way too long. I did it for like two or three straight minutes

1407
02:05:59,539 --> 02:06:05,170
That's I got my I got my laugh track ready

1408
02:06:05,890 --> 02:06:09,970
No, hold on. It's got to be better. Like you guys got to get if we got this is gonna be accurate

1409
02:06:10,529 --> 02:06:12,529
So we got two that are fine, right?

1410
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:19,170
All right, so that that one's a good one

1411
02:06:19,250 --> 02:06:21,489
So we'll we have to have a really really like

1412
02:06:22,210 --> 02:06:24,380
a really like angry one

1413
02:06:35,869 --> 02:06:38,829
That's good and this one now that's bad this one is good

1414
02:06:40,829 --> 02:06:45,090
No, no, no, I got better this is good

1415
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:56,539
So now if I see a bunch of minus twos, I know what to press and I see a lot of plus twos

1416
02:06:56,539 --> 02:06:58,539
I know what to press

1417
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:02,880
And this is if you don't like if you don't think it's funny

1418
02:07:06,819 --> 02:07:17,039
Okay, play the game. All right. Yeah. Yeah, we got okay. All right, right, right. It's monkey friday. That's enough

1419
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,359
Okay, let's go

1420
02:07:19,359 --> 02:07:24,220
Okay about yourselves

1421
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:27,260
I'm sweet. The ladies call me captain kk

1422
02:07:31,729 --> 02:07:33,729
We used to work the sound in this town

1423
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:36,260
Until queen came around

1424
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:40,539
Kk is short for cakes

1425
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:44,220
She made music against the law unless you make a song she likes

1426
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:53,420
But the only junk she enjoys are reverse disc tracks where the vocalist puts themselves down and praises the queen

1427
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:00,380
Or noise music

1428
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:03,489
But even if queenie tries to put a limiter on us

1429
02:08:04,289 --> 02:08:06,289
You can't stop the music

1430
02:08:06,609 --> 02:08:09,729
Hear that we'll just go underground crash boom bang

1431
02:08:10,529 --> 02:08:14,930
That's why we made this junk shop. We'll fund our musical rebellion

1432
02:08:15,409 --> 02:08:17,409
Can we make noise music too?

1433
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:23,899
Okay performance you want to see what we got?

1434
02:08:24,699 --> 02:08:27,020
Can you handle this hold on to your antennas?

1435
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:33,500
How is that how is that?

1436
02:08:37,739 --> 02:08:43,010
That was good all our songs are only four seconds long

1437
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:51,329
Okay, a queen wasn't always so harsh

1438
02:08:52,210 --> 02:08:54,930
No, she was she just got worse somehow

1439
02:08:55,569 --> 02:08:59,869
It wasn't until that dark fountain showed up she started going into overdrive

1440
02:09:02,579 --> 02:09:04,579
Night this night that fountain that

1441
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:09,380
Like what does that night even have going for it that I can't that I don't come on gwen

1442
02:09:12,050 --> 02:09:14,050
zoomer tiktok musicians

1443
02:09:14,689 --> 02:09:23,300
But like I said, she wasn't always so bad. She used to give me sweets for being so sweet

1444
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:25,939
Oh, I never got candy

1445
02:09:25,939 --> 02:09:30,800
He kept calling her a hot mama cap

1446
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:34,720
Yeah, is that wrong? She looks like a mom and tends to overheat

1447
02:09:36,210 --> 02:09:38,850
KK help me out here. Oh, what do you think me?

1448
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:41,489
I like candy

1449
02:09:41,489 --> 02:09:45,170
Yeah, you're right. KK. We got to focus on what's important if the band fights we'll get out of tune

1450
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:47,890
And we have any lemon drops

1451
02:09:47,970 --> 02:09:55,060
Junk work our main gig is making scrap into machines. Our clients are sometimes a bit off key though

1452
02:09:55,619 --> 02:09:57,619
They smell off key, too

1453
02:09:57,859 --> 02:09:59,859
Like some little weird guy

1454
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:02,020
He wanted us to sneak into queen's mansion

1455
02:10:02,899 --> 02:10:04,899
We're just rebels. We don't want to get in trouble

1456
02:10:06,659 --> 02:10:08,659
Recently, we got a real high class client

1457
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:12,819
A man of taste he had a way with words. I couldn't even understand him

1458
02:10:12,819 --> 02:10:15,140
I blew my voice out doing the fucking chimpanzee shit

1459
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:18,340
Like I it's gone

1460
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:21,569
I'm only two hours in

1461
02:10:21,569 --> 02:10:25,329
Now all we got to do is follow the blueprints, right? It'll be our big time break

1462
02:10:26,369 --> 02:10:28,449
Yeah, haha. It's gonna break apart big time

1463
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:37,920
Uh, I need some I need some water. All right, so now we can buy

1464
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:41,039
CD bagel you gotta make it cheaper than that. What the hell?

1465
02:10:42,369 --> 02:10:48,130
Mecha saber. All right. I have a question. This is a backseat question for all you guys

1466
02:10:49,170 --> 02:10:50,449
um

1467
02:10:50,449 --> 02:10:54,130
If i'm gonna try to just do the kind of passive just run

1468
02:10:55,170 --> 02:10:58,289
Did I even buy the weapons? Is there even a reason to buy them?

1469
02:10:59,170 --> 02:11:01,470
If I don't plan on swinging the sword once

1470
02:11:01,949 --> 02:11:04,960
There's no point, right?

1471
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:09,869
Okay, well I

1472
02:11:09,869 --> 02:11:11,869

So we're gonna go ahead

1508
02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:43,810
We're gonna go ahead and we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna jiggle the wire

1509
02:13:45,579 --> 02:13:47,100
Then we're gonna go ahead

Oh, i'm so dumb. Okay s action standard. No, no, no, no, no just defend

02:13:57,890 --> 02:14:02,050
And then you're going to do pacify on anybody probably you

1513
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:17,060
I can't imagine screaming for like

1514
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:18,979
15 straight hours

1515
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:23,979
Okay, so that means now let's do

1516
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:25,970

My brain is is flogged right now. Can I just keep doing that until?

1520
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:57,539
Like can I let's for instance, can I just like keep jiggle jiggle and then not necessarily pacify. Will that take it off?

1521
02:15:05,069 --> 02:15:07,069
No, okay. So they have to be pacified

1522
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Once they're tired, they just stay tired

1523
02:15:14,239 --> 02:15:17,250
I got the three check marks. Yeah, I did

1524
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:29,010

Yes

1526
02:15:32,579 --> 02:15:34,100

What's your opinion on chili dogs?

1550
02:17:19,469 --> 02:17:20,510
Yeah

1551
02:17:20,510 --> 02:17:32,750
Not really. I can't touch this thing. It's too much. It's too messy. I like the flavor

1552
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:42,270
Why do I say bombs?

1553
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:44,430
Oh if they hit that they they explode

1554
02:17:46,030 --> 02:17:48,030
Yes. Oh what?

Then was it something down here?

1558
02:18:20,129 --> 02:18:23,329
I didn't that just opened the ability to go up or was there like something over here

1559
02:18:31,549 --> 02:18:35,899
Why does this sound like a mario party song?

1560
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:39,420
It's kind of mario party like isn't it?

1561
02:18:41,579 --> 02:18:43,180

02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:20,450
Hey, what the hell are these things?

1568
02:19:21,219 --> 02:19:23,299
Looks like if we ride them

1569
02:19:23,299 --> 02:19:25,299
They might bring us over to the fountain

1570
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:31,680
Really and let's get on I have just getting just flashbacks

1571

Of that stupid ass fucking battle toads level that was impossible without a game a game tracker game genie

1572
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:43,040
Remember that dumb level where you had to ride the thing and it was impossible you crashed into everything

1573
02:19:46,270 --> 02:19:50,030
Enough you okay. Hold on. Excuse me enough you foolish children

That was not a miss. It was a tactical calibration

1578
02:20:11,629 --> 02:20:14,510
Are you gonna try it again?

1579
02:20:14,909 --> 02:20:17,229

a true

1606
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:59,360
Scientocracy where the geniuses of the world

1607
02:22:00,450 --> 02:22:03,670
Can bathe freely in pools of fresh fruit and ambrosia

1608
02:22:04,819 --> 02:22:06,020
by the way

1609
02:22:06,020 --> 02:22:09,329
This is something to think about

1610
02:22:09,389 --> 02:22:12,590
Ambrosia is supposed to be like the thing that gods ate

1611
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:14,799
right

1612
02:22:14,799 --> 02:22:17,059
Oh, they they and they sipped on ambrosia

1613
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:21,200
Why did that turn into like a disgusting fucking dessert?

1614
02:22:22,979 --> 02:22:24,899
That ambrosia

1615
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:29,010
Is gross

1616
02:22:29,010 --> 02:22:35,590
That's what we say ambrosia is what is it's like chunks of marshmallow and like potato salad

1617
02:22:36,069 --> 02:22:38,069
This is what the gods apparently ate

1618
02:22:40,239 --> 02:22:43,280
No, what that sucks. What a shitty fucking dessert

1619
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:51,840
It's because you're immortal

1620
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:56,079
No, what is okay? I'm serious like i've had ambrosia like once and I was like this like sucks

1621
02:22:57,750 --> 02:23:00,209
What is actually in it? It's

1622
02:23:00,209 --> 02:23:05,729
Yeah, this stuff is fucking gross like macaroni salad and like fruit salad combined. There's like was it mayonnaise in this

1623
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:11,590
Oh the absolute the fruit the delectable of the gods

1624
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,120
Of course

1625
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:19,409
What would be in it besides?

1626
02:23:19,409 --> 02:23:21,719
fruit salad

1627
02:23:21,719 --> 02:23:22,600
and

1628
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:24,260
gross cheap

1629
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:27,889
Marshmallow cubes

1630
02:23:27,889 --> 02:23:31,729
Ah, yes. Yes, bring me. Yes peon. Bring me my ambrosia

1631
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:34,370
I'll take that whipped cream out of the can

1632
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Mini marshmallows and fruits

1633
02:23:39,479 --> 02:23:41,079
It's as if

1634
02:23:41,079 --> 02:23:42,920
a three-year-old

1635
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:44,920
Sat down and made their own recipe

1636
02:23:46,399 --> 02:23:48,959
Bring it to me on a platter on silver

1637
02:23:55,360 --> 02:23:57,520
Why is ambrosia? Yeah, okay

1638
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:16,329
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you he's immortal

1639
02:24:16,569 --> 02:24:17,770
Oh

1640
02:24:17,770 --> 02:24:24,489
No, it's fucking what that's not like the death dessert of the gods the dessert of the gods is baklava. I'm telling you right now

1641
02:24:25,209 --> 02:24:28,729
That's what ambrosia is ambrosia was baklava. Okay

1642
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:36,090
Look it up. It had to be fucking our ambrosia. No, it's either chocolate ice cream or it's baklava pick one

1643
02:24:41,979 --> 02:24:44,540
No longer held back by protozoans like you

1644
02:24:48,579 --> 02:24:51,299
And the key to that is us noelle and I

1645
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:54,260
Our power the light nerds

1646
02:24:56,729 --> 02:25:02,180
The light nerds

1647
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:04,420
Oh, no queen said light nerds

1648

Thirdly queen's just manipulating you

1650
02:25:13,639 --> 02:25:15,639
That's what she said you'd say to me

1651
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:20,100
I actually did that

1652
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:21,299

1653
02:25:21,299 --> 02:25:23,219

All right, so let's bump bump x everyone rides coaster

The whole gang will attempt to bump into birdley's car

1667
02:26:36,010 --> 02:26:43,690
Chris you're tired of being the class number three gazing distantly at noelle and I's

1668
02:26:44,010 --> 02:26:45,610
fruited figures

02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:55,659
Birdley shows queen his card collection queen escaped successfully

1670
02:26:57,819 --> 02:26:59,579

Bump into birdley's car

02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:29,850
I'm just gonna keep doing it

1677
02:27:29,850 --> 02:27:33,450
Chris you are truly depraved playing in the mud with the class hellion

1678
02:27:34,329 --> 02:27:43,370

1679
02:27:43,370 --> 02:27:45,540

1688
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:18,860
a plus

1689
02:28:18,860 --> 02:28:23,590
What the fuck is going on in this game?

1690
02:28:24,229 --> 02:28:26,309
Are they talking about studying in class that we're in?

1691
02:28:27,979 --> 02:28:30,280
This is weird. I want answers

1692
02:28:31,829 --> 02:28:39,530
Uh, let's go for another super bomb. My car is breaking

1693
02:28:40,250 --> 02:28:43,610

1694
02:28:44,489 --> 02:28:50,170
Go ahead bump me you bump barons. I'll show you bumper cars. It's a game of intellect not skill

1696
02:29:01,219 --> 02:29:06,329

regular bump

1699
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:14,790
And heal yourself

1700
02:29:20,469 --> 02:29:22,790
Partake chris the sufferer of punishment

1701
02:29:23,510 --> 02:29:33,239

1705
02:29:41,639 --> 02:29:43,340
So you're right

1706
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:45,340
Uh, let's just let's knock the car down

1707
02:29:52,069 --> 02:29:54,180

1708
02:29:54,180 --> 02:29:55,620

1709
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:57,620
Oh what that's not fair?

1710
02:29:59,290 --> 02:30:01,450
My queen my queen save me

1711
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:10,760
In a minute, dear. Hello everyone. I have some news updates

1712
02:30:11,559 --> 02:30:12,760

1713
02:30:12,760 --> 02:30:14,760
This roller coaster

1714
02:30:15,639 --> 02:30:17,719
It's not actually finished yet

1715
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:20,600
What does that mean?

1716
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:22,600
a pain

1717
02:30:37,239 --> 02:30:42,620
Looks like this trash saved us

1718
02:30:43,979 --> 02:30:51,879
Come on. Oh who's king of the trash pile now?

1719
02:30:56,780 --> 02:31:00,319
Good reflexes there good reflexes very good reflexes

1720
02:31:02,459 --> 02:31:05,639
Susie are you all right?

1721
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:09,260
It's nothing I just

1722
02:31:09,979 --> 02:31:13,299
Oh, ow

1723
02:31:13,379 --> 02:31:15,620
Sure, you don't want me to look

1724
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:18,170
Look at what i'm fine

1725
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:29,750
What are you doing feel better

1726
02:31:30,790 --> 02:31:35,110
Feel better after you just came up and I acting the acting

1727
02:31:35,829 --> 02:31:46,469
Um, it doesn't feel worse, I guess how do you do that anyway?

1728
02:31:48,389 --> 02:31:50,389
And healing thingy

1729
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:52,790
Oh healing magic. It's simple. Uh

1730
02:31:53,190 --> 02:31:57,979
Susie anyone can do it. I could even teach you if you're interested

1731
02:31:59,739 --> 02:32:02,379
Ask me again when it's like blood explosion magic

1732
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:12,540
But if you wanted I guess I could learn it and you wouldn't you know have to annoy me with it anymore

1733
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:14,379
uh

1734
02:32:14,379 --> 02:32:15,979
Sure susie

1735
02:32:15,979 --> 02:32:17,979
Next time we have a break

1736
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:23,379
Just go already chris

1737
02:32:23,379 --> 02:32:25,399
There's like an oscar the grouch in here

1738
02:32:25,399 --> 02:32:29,959
You dug through the trash and found a dark candy our candy was added to your items. Nice

1739
02:32:30,520 --> 02:32:37,559
It's a trash bag that looks like an eggplant. I was gonna say cash register

1740
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:52,280
Okay

1741
02:32:52,280 --> 02:32:54,920
Oh, i'm trying to figure out got it

1742
02:32:56,979 --> 02:32:58,979
Oh boy. Oh boy. I'm trashy

1743
02:32:59,780 --> 02:33:01,940
Is it all about adjusting your inventory?

1744
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:05,430
Trash cans like me can hold all sorts of things

1745
02:33:06,579 --> 02:33:09,780
Just like your storage if you get more than 12 items

1746
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:15,260
Uh, yeah, not now, dude

1747
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:19,020
It's sort of an emotional moment

1748
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:21,100
Oh, oh, that's okay

1749
02:33:23,290 --> 02:33:25,450
Oh hell is that newbert over there?

1750
02:33:29,139 --> 02:33:31,459
Oh newbert's here. Sorry trash can guy

1751
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:42,180
This is an eggplant. I'm newbert. Everybody loves me. That's why I live in this trash

1752
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:53,559
No time for this guy

1753
02:33:53,559 --> 02:33:55,159
All right, so should I go up?

1754
02:33:55,159 --> 02:33:58,329
It's a lone door frame, but for some reason you can't see through it

1755
02:34:03,420 --> 02:34:05,739
That's my man. That's my man newbert

1756
02:34:06,299 --> 02:34:12,139
By the way chris, I just remembered although you can only carry 12 items around

1757
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:15,420
Your storage will hold any extra items you pick up. Yeah

1758
02:34:16,139 --> 02:34:18,139
You can access it where you check recruits

1759
02:34:18,780 --> 02:34:21,340
Enemies you spare get recruited to our town remember

1760
02:34:22,219 --> 02:34:26,040
It's a pretty useful information

1761
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:36,170
It is there's a fork in the path chris it seems like it might be advantageous

1762
02:34:37,350 --> 02:34:38,870
If we split up

1763
02:34:38,870 --> 02:34:42,489
Who do you want to go with?

1764
02:34:42,489 --> 02:34:44,969
Uh, well rousy has the heel so i'm gonna go with rousy

1765
02:34:48,379 --> 02:34:50,379
that's i'm just

1766
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:52,540
Basing this on how I feel

1767
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:57,500
With i'm i'm gonna go with rousy because I suzy does not have a heel right now

1768
02:34:58,219 --> 02:35:02,059
And i'm going with rousy. That's my decision. That's what i've decided

1769
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:05,819
If anybody wants to call me cringe like I just saw five people said cringe

1770
02:35:06,540 --> 02:35:07,739
That's fine

1771
02:35:07,739 --> 02:35:15,059
I'm apparently i'm cringe. I'm going with rousy. Hey, why does chris get to choose all the time?

1772
02:35:16,299 --> 02:35:18,729
Rousy you're going with me

1773
02:35:18,729 --> 02:35:27,770
Uh crap

1774
02:35:27,770 --> 02:35:32,379
Okay, i'm gonna explain the joke. I didn't do the joke. I'm gonna explain it though

1775
02:35:35,479 --> 02:35:37,479
Sit down sit down sit down not yet

1776
02:35:37,639 --> 02:35:38,700
um

1777
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:40,940
I was gonna just do like a fart sound like

1778
02:35:42,219 --> 02:35:44,409
And then go man

1779
02:35:44,409 --> 02:35:46,649
I've been holding that in for like three hours. Thank god i'm alone

1780
02:35:46,649 --> 02:35:56,629
I

1781
02:36:00,549 --> 02:36:02,870
Somebody liked it somebody liked that somebody thought that was funny

1782
02:36:04,090 --> 02:36:06,090
I'm clearing that we're not doing that again the rest of stream

1783
02:36:06,649 --> 02:36:09,620
I just cleared it

1784
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:11,620
I that that voice is not happening anymore. We're done

1785
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:15,700
I cleared it. I cleared it from the xlr

1786
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:32,040
All right, hold on. What can I do anything else? Oh shit. I can go this way. What's that?

1787
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:45,620
somebody's trash house

1788
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:49,930
The door is locked

1789
02:36:49,930 --> 02:37:17,690
Is that just is that trashy's house? I would assume probably is don't look sad

1790
02:37:17,930 --> 02:37:20,229
You're never alone. You got new bird

1791
02:37:24,229 --> 02:37:29,670
You can hold a lot more in your storage, you know, oh, but you won't be able to use it during battle

1792
02:37:30,389 --> 02:37:32,389
Check it and make sure you have what you need

1793
02:37:33,770 --> 02:37:56,409
It's what I wanted to see what I already said. Why are you saying shush? Don't shush me. Welcome to

1794
02:37:57,450 --> 02:37:58,649
the

1795
02:37:58,649 --> 02:37:59,690
City

1796
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:06,100
I just thought they were just back there. You have neither fluffy boys nor mean girls with you now

1797
02:38:06,719 --> 02:38:10,100
Reluctantly you are filled with the power from the cat sign

1798
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:30,920
I heard the roller coasters are undergoing maintenance. That's a pain because it's our only form of public transit

1799
02:38:34,139 --> 02:38:38,219
Welcome to cyber city pedestrians need to press the switch to cross traffic

1800
02:38:38,940 --> 02:38:49,459
About how mad would you be?

1801
02:38:49,459 --> 02:38:51,940
You're in a car and you still sort of like just press the button

1802
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:57,159
And the the walk sign happened everybody stopped and they just don't move and then they press it again

1803
02:38:59,420 --> 02:39:01,500
By the way, can somebody correct me here? I need to know this

1804
02:39:02,219 --> 02:39:05,819
I've been told like three different things about how that system works

1805
02:39:07,399 --> 02:39:13,000
Does that actually do anything? I've been told that when you press the the button it actually is just a placebo

1806
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
It doesn't actually do anything

1807
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:19,219
Is that accurate?

1808
02:39:19,219 --> 02:39:20,579
Some of them do

1809
02:39:20,579 --> 02:39:23,899
Some of them some do nothing

1810
02:39:23,899 --> 02:39:26,329
It depends depends on the city

1811
02:39:26,329 --> 02:39:27,930
So I have it

1812
02:39:27,930 --> 02:39:34,709
Just to give the pedestrian something to do to make it feel like they're doing something. It's a placebo effect

1813
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:38,579
It depends on where but most actually do something

1814
02:39:41,319 --> 02:39:43,319
I've heard conflicting information over the years

1815
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:51,270
Oh god, this is um

1816
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:53,110
donkey kong country

1817
02:39:53,110 --> 02:39:56,469
The donkey don't come country. We have to jump and hit the lights and keep the lights on

1818
02:39:58,040 --> 02:40:02,780
Whatever it is the stop thing

1819
02:40:02,860 --> 02:40:06,260
Oh

1820
02:40:06,260 --> 02:40:14,250
Oh nice

1821
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:18,840
That level was brutal. It really was it was horrible

1822
02:40:19,479 --> 02:40:23,319
What are we cleaning up for you ask?

1823
02:40:23,719 --> 02:40:25,719
We don't know a parade perhaps

1824
02:40:25,959 --> 02:40:27,239
possibly

1825
02:40:27,239 --> 02:40:32,280
Hey, how bad am I peas?

1826
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:34,440
I have to switch out this thing. I think

1827
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:36,920
When I say like oh like a peter

1828
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:40,120
A peter piper picked a pick of pickled peppers, right?

1829
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
It's it kind of sucks, right?

1830
02:40:43,780 --> 02:40:45,780
You get are you getting the uh the pops?

1831
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:52,170
Because I feel like sometimes it happens. Is it good?

1832
02:40:54,860 --> 02:40:57,659
I swear to god. I feel like it happens a lot. I think I have to get a new pop filter

1833
02:40:58,219 --> 02:41:05,700
A large event is going to happen in the streets later. We were told to make room for something big

1834
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:12,709
We're trashed

1835
02:41:12,709 --> 02:41:14,229
dug through the trash

1836
02:41:14,229 --> 02:41:15,909
Found twenty dollars

1837
02:41:15,909 --> 02:41:18,229
Only dark dollars was added to your money hole

1838
02:41:23,850 --> 02:41:25,850
They're making room for your ass

1839
02:41:27,319 --> 02:41:31,860
Good one. Whoa pop-ups popped up

1840
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:35,750
I kind of want to kill the pop-ups

1841
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:40,149
All right pop-up, uh click or block click. I'm gonna click the pop-up

1842
02:41:40,870 --> 02:41:45,370
You unconsciously clicked on an ad for a video about making knives out of spaghetti

1843
02:41:48,379 --> 02:41:52,360
That made another one click here click here click click

1844
02:41:53,159 --> 02:41:58,979
Oh, that sucks

1845
02:41:58,979 --> 02:42:01,540
Up up is preening its weird rubbery flesh

1846
02:42:03,209 --> 02:42:04,409
All right block

1847
02:42:04,409 --> 02:42:06,579
It's why repeatedly block the ads

1848
02:42:10,149 --> 02:42:12,149
Walk 10 ads happy

1849
02:42:14,299 --> 02:42:15,659
Oh now I can see

1850
02:42:15,659 --> 02:42:20,420
Okay

1851
02:42:20,420 --> 02:42:21,620
It's there

1852
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:31,110
It's easy with no ads

1853
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:35,850
Now click it again. No

1854
02:42:36,010 --> 02:42:45,459
I don't want to click the ad again. I clicked it once

1855
02:42:50,540 --> 02:43:00,520
cd bagel nice

1856
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:03,780
Okay, what are you doing here?

1857
02:43:03,860 --> 02:43:07,739
Who are you and what are you doing here? Chris? What are you?

1858
02:43:08,780 --> 02:43:10,780
Oh, no. Hell, sweetie

1859
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:14,040
Don't let her find me

1860
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:18,010
No, well, sweetie darling, honey. Where are you?

1861
02:43:19,129 --> 02:43:21,129
We're a team now remember

1862
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:23,370
You still have to be my willing minion

1863
02:43:25,020 --> 02:43:26,280
Chris

1864
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:27,639
It appears

1865
02:43:27,639 --> 02:43:30,520
Our comrades have pressed the escape key on us

1866
02:43:32,149 --> 02:43:34,069
So it has come to this

1867
02:43:34,069 --> 02:43:40,600
In order to find our teams

1868
02:43:41,319 --> 02:43:43,319
We must form an uneasy truce

1869
02:43:46,819 --> 02:43:49,139
Queen my splendid queen. Where are you?

1870
02:43:50,309 --> 02:43:52,309
Oh, no, don't let him fight me

1871
02:43:56,629 --> 02:43:59,590
Ah chris not the life form I was looking for

1872
02:44:01,399 --> 02:44:03,879
Hmm, where's the rest of the c plus squad?

1873
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:07,110
Don't tell me you've got abandoned

1874
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:11,690
Ha ha ha ha ha ha that's what you get for trusting susie

1875
02:44:13,049 --> 02:44:14,489
Uh, huh?

1876
02:44:14,489 --> 02:44:16,090
well

1877
02:44:16,090 --> 02:44:17,379
fiend

1878
02:44:17,379 --> 02:44:18,579
They're just

1879
02:44:18,579 --> 02:44:20,579
They're just busy retro gaming somewhere

1880
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:23,899
I bet they're waiting for me on the player select screen

1881
02:44:25,139 --> 02:44:27,139
Listening to strangely groovy music

1882
02:44:30,309 --> 02:44:33,450
Uh, so it's come to this

1883
02:44:34,780 --> 02:44:36,780
In order to find our respective teams

1884
02:44:37,659 --> 02:44:41,040
It appears we must form an uneasy truce

1885
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:46,920
He said you could double truces

1886
02:44:48,889 --> 02:44:50,889
Huh? Did you hear something?

1887
02:44:54,299 --> 02:44:56,299
No, it's just the sounds of the city

1888
02:44:58,280 --> 02:45:00,270
Oh, okay

1889
02:45:00,270 --> 02:45:02,909
Well, i'll be ahead don't be late

1890
02:45:03,549 --> 02:45:11,549
First as part of our truce better one keep distracting birdly and find a well

1891
02:45:12,590 --> 02:45:14,959
Oh, you see

1892
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:17,690
Birdly he's

1893
02:45:18,250 --> 02:45:21,479
Okay, there's nothing wrong with him. He's just annoying

1894
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:29,469
Toodles yes, I um if it's okay

1895
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:33,610
Don't even refer another truce

1896
02:45:33,610 --> 02:45:35,610
No triple truces

1897
02:45:37,309 --> 02:45:46,430
Yeah, we can we can have another truce. I think yeah, like it's gonna be triple truces. No triple truces

1898
02:45:46,510 --> 02:46:01,370
But no, that's no i'm saying of course. Thanks chris. I will join the party. What is the sugar form?

1899
02:46:07,319 --> 02:46:09,319
So um any idea where susie is?

1900
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:12,430
Well, i'm just asking it's a normal question

1901
02:46:12,590 --> 02:46:19,370
I don't know. I have no idea where susie is

1902
02:46:19,850 --> 02:46:34,920
Is that what's that? What's that? What's this? What's this? Um, um mouse

1903
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:41,340
Sorry chris, could you deal with them?

1904
02:46:41,819 --> 02:46:43,819
Maybe you can get them in the other mouse hole

1905
02:46:45,129 --> 02:46:47,530
Annoying mouse room. Okay. Well I

1906
02:46:48,170 --> 02:46:52,719
Do they come out they bounce?

1907
02:46:53,440 --> 02:46:55,200
Hold on. How do they bounce?

1908
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:58,090
All right, so we gotta go like this

1909
02:46:58,090 --> 02:47:00,090
All right, you say I know I know I did

1910
02:47:00,090 --> 02:47:09,500
What does that do? Not quite i'm gonna move it over here. Yep

1911
02:47:10,920 --> 02:47:12,440
Uh, thank you

1912
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:20,700
Mice will rotate 90 degrees when they collide with the block. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I figured it out

1913
02:47:25,629 --> 02:47:33,680
Why have I already recruited all these?

1914
02:47:34,479 --> 02:47:36,079
Well, what does noel do?

1915
02:47:36,079 --> 02:47:38,079
What's going on? What are we doing?

1916
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:45,389
I mean, what are you telling me to do act?

1917
02:47:46,350 --> 02:47:48,350
Can someone please explain what's going on?

1918
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:50,750
Boy, is this your first time in a battle?

1919
02:47:50,989 --> 02:47:53,360
Uh, well, yes

1920
02:47:53,360 --> 02:47:56,000
Oh boy

1921
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:01,370
You and viril viril cone explained how battles work to noel. Oh, I get it

1922
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:05,610
It's kind of like dragon blazers and if we're nice to you we can win through mercy

1923
02:48:06,489 --> 02:48:07,690
Yeah

1924
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:09,870
And the way I have to do that is

1925
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:12,250
Dressing up in a weird costume

1926
02:48:12,329 --> 02:48:14,700
Yeah

1927
02:48:14,700 --> 02:48:17,500

This is a new enemy

1932
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:44,540
Ambulances beeped towards you

1933
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:48,409

1934
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000

02:49:27,319 --> 02:49:29,319
Advertisements not only 9.99

1941
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:36,200
Don't like advertisements block ads for only 9.99 change your mind bring them back for only 9.99

1942
02:49:41,899 --> 02:49:45,049
I'm just gonna run an ad

1943
02:49:45,049 --> 02:49:47,530
But I don't want to like delete a third of the audience here

1944
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:56,600
Don't like advertisements block ads. Oh same thing

1945
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:01,739

Can't even cross the street without getting my ass kicked. I love this city

1963
02:51:09,139 --> 02:51:14,100
Because everyone else got plugged. They're a lot more agreeable

1964
02:51:14,819 --> 02:51:18,709

02:52:19,649 --> 02:52:20,790
everywhere

1975
02:52:20,790 --> 02:52:23,909
Even to the fucking doctor

1976
02:52:23,909 --> 02:52:25,909
Just a six pack in your hand

1977
02:52:26,229 --> 02:52:28,229
In the waiting room and in the doctor's office and shit

1978

1984
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:09,459
What do you mean?

1985
02:53:09,459 --> 02:53:11,459
Is it advertisement for a giant ferris wheel?

1986
02:53:12,020 --> 02:53:15,059
Gosh, that's amazing makes the one at the festival look like a toy

02:53:16,100 --> 02:53:18,100

02:53:53,819 --> 02:53:56,379

This has been my neighbor forever. We've been through so much. Sometimes it feels like we know each other better than anyone

2001
02:54:13,469 --> 02:54:15,950
It's somehow it's hard to say. We're exactly friends

2002
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:19,760
I

2003
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:21,479

02:54:35,229 --> 02:54:37,229
Ah, you two don't look together

2008
02:54:37,819 --> 02:54:40,459
Uh, can I interest you in some brand new divorcing shoes?

2009
02:54:45,870 --> 02:54:47,870
Yeah, that's it. Yeah look

2010
02:54:47,870 --> 02:54:52,729
Where do I how do I look?

2011
02:54:52,729 --> 02:55:00,270
Who is this guy? Hey

2012
02:55:00,670 --> 02:55:03,709
Any way to deal with crushing existential dread?

2013
02:55:04,670 --> 02:55:06,190
Asking for a friend

2014
02:55:06,190 --> 02:55:09,309
Friend that looks and sounds exactly like me

2015
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:18,639
You're talking about me

2016
02:55:23,610 --> 02:55:33,260
All right, that's best that's best joke of the game so far without a doubt that was definitely the best routine so far

2017
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:41,180
No, leave me alone

2018
02:55:41,180 --> 02:55:54,299
What do I get to kind of move I go down. Oh I go down. Oh

2019
02:55:55,549 --> 02:55:56,750
Hey

2020
02:55:56,750 --> 02:55:58,829
Looks like you need to hold it down. Yeah, can you stand over here?

2021
02:55:59,469 --> 02:56:02,909
You keep standing on this one

2022
02:56:02,909 --> 02:56:04,909
I'll stand on this one

2023
02:56:04,909 --> 02:56:07,959
And now you come over here

2024
02:56:07,959 --> 02:56:09,319
Nice teamwork

2025
02:56:09,319 --> 02:56:10,200
Yeah

2026
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:12,030
It was nice teamwork

2027
02:56:12,030 --> 02:56:20,040
The game lost in the craftsmanship of the boxes

2028
02:56:28,959 --> 02:56:30,959
Oh, it's the queen. She's right over there

2029
02:56:31,280 --> 02:56:35,100
Can you distract her somehow?

2030
02:56:35,739 --> 02:56:39,719
Oh

2031
02:56:39,799 --> 02:56:41,799
You're here

2032
02:56:41,959 --> 02:56:49,959
Sorry chris while i've been looking for noelle. I've had like four of these all ages appropriate glasses of pure battery acid

2033
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:58,010
Don't worry, that was my throwing glass it's safe

2034
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:01,760
Look chris

2035
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:03,879
crisscross applesauce

2036
02:57:03,879 --> 02:57:06,920
Now that we are truces. I feel like we are on the same

2037
02:57:08,260 --> 02:57:10,569
mathematical wavelength

2038
02:57:11,229 --> 02:57:13,000
And you get me chris

2039
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
You do not do

2040
02:57:15,159 --> 02:57:19,799
You do not do crazy things like have opinions or scream when I capture you

2041
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:23,610
Or tell me horrible plans for smart boy theme park

2042
02:57:24,489 --> 02:57:26,329
I just cannot compute it

2043
02:57:26,329 --> 02:57:28,329
Why everyone else is so ungrateful?

2044
02:57:30,729 --> 02:57:35,149
I learned that from master shake. Whoops. That was my extra dangerous glass

2045
02:57:37,360 --> 02:57:40,479
chris

2046
02:57:40,479 --> 02:57:42,479
I just want to make everyone smile

2047
02:57:42,879 --> 02:57:46,329
And if I become an evil villain to accomplish that

2048
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:50,510
Is that bad?

2049
02:57:50,510 --> 02:57:51,709
It's okay

2050
02:57:51,709 --> 02:57:56,860
You do not have to answer

2051
02:57:56,860 --> 02:57:58,139
You would be wrong

2052
02:57:58,139 --> 02:58:00,139
But chris while we're still truces

2053
02:58:00,540 --> 02:58:02,540
Maybe we could make the most of it

2054
02:58:02,940 --> 02:58:07,079
We could play that game again. Wasn't that fun chris?

2055
02:58:08,909 --> 02:58:10,670
Just you and me

2056
02:58:10,670 --> 02:58:12,670
Having a good time

2057
02:58:12,750 --> 02:58:14,750
No one else to get in the way

2058
02:58:16,030 --> 02:58:27,549
Queen i've been looking everywhere to show you this a monument to our greatness together

2059
02:58:29,149 --> 02:58:30,430
oh

2060
02:58:30,430 --> 02:58:32,350

2061
02:58:32,350 --> 02:58:36,190

2062
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:38,639

So smart you are I love tolerating you

2066
02:58:45,760 --> 02:58:48,239
I knew you'd be an omen such perfect taste

2067
02:58:50,239 --> 02:58:54,959
Very cool statues. I did. Ah, I don't know you had uh nipples

2068
02:58:56,959 --> 02:58:59,680
I will soon in our ideal world

2069
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:04,020
Chris feel free to admire our artisanship

2070
02:59:05,319 --> 02:59:07,319
Queen and I have plans to consider

2071
02:59:08,750 --> 02:59:10,829
Oh, yes. Oh good looking forward to that

2072
02:59:11,770 --> 02:59:15,049
Hmm. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Let's go, uh burglary

2073
02:59:18,090 --> 02:59:20,090
Keep going. I'm right behind you

2074
02:59:22,079 --> 02:59:24,079
Procedurally lowering the volume of my body

2075
02:59:26,889 --> 02:59:28,969
Sorry chris. I must opt tab out of here

2076
02:59:31,360 --> 02:59:37,049
Wow cool face

2077
02:59:43,899 --> 02:59:47,420
Cool face looks like my disguise worked

2078
02:59:49,100 --> 02:59:51,100
It's silly looking but it beats hiding

2079
02:59:54,159 --> 03:00:00,559
Let's get going chris. Look, it's you. Oh

2080
03:00:01,899 --> 03:00:03,180
oh

2081
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:05,100
I can't see anything. Haha

2082
03:00:05,100 --> 03:00:08,319
Yes, i'll try not to wear it unless I have to

2083
03:00:08,959 --> 03:00:14,670
Okay, let's go for a reel this time. What is this?

2084
03:00:16,270 --> 03:00:18,270
That's a big laugh. That's like a fuck

2085
03:00:19,799 --> 03:00:23,899
You chris, can you stop looking at this?

2086
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:32,479
You became lost in the craftsmanship

2087
03:00:32,879 --> 03:00:34,879
Why do we have to look at it twice?

2088
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:39,579
Because there's so much to look at here

2089
03:00:39,579 --> 03:00:41,979
chris

2090
03:00:41,979 --> 03:00:44,250
It's a work of art

2091
03:00:44,250 --> 03:00:46,590
What part are you looking at?

2092
03:00:46,590 --> 03:00:50,139
If I say I like it, will you stop looking at it?

2093
03:00:51,870 --> 03:00:54,239
Isn't this thing just the best?

2094
03:00:54,319 --> 03:00:56,319
The statue seems to suck bad

2095
03:00:57,389 --> 03:00:58,430
chris

2096
03:00:58,430 --> 03:01:00,780
There's no reason to look at this

2097
03:01:00,780 --> 03:01:03,469
There's no reason to look at this anymore. There's no reason

2098
03:01:08,909 --> 03:01:12,889
Oh, it's our friends

2099
03:01:12,889 --> 03:01:14,969
Energetic music wafts from the boxes

2100
03:01:15,850 --> 03:01:17,850
Filled with the power of musical bagels

2101
03:01:18,409 --> 03:01:25,100
What'll it be chief?

2102
03:01:25,180 --> 03:01:26,540
Oh, I hope you didn't hear that

2103
03:01:26,540 --> 03:01:29,420
I think the music was covering it but like a frog sound came out of my mouth because I

2104
03:01:29,739 --> 03:01:31,739
You know what I mean? I internally burped

2105
03:01:32,379 --> 03:01:34,540
What'll it be chief? I got cd bagels 80 dollars pop

2106
03:01:37,659 --> 03:01:38,940
Uh, let's just talk

2107
03:01:38,940 --> 03:01:42,299
Who is that? Uh mademoiselle leave her alone cap

2108
03:01:43,020 --> 03:01:45,739
Nice radio antenna you got there. Those are antlers cap

2109
03:01:46,829 --> 03:01:48,190
Huh? I oh

2110
03:01:48,190 --> 03:01:51,200
Let's play her a song

2111
03:02:04,989 --> 03:02:06,270
I was waiting

2112
03:02:06,270 --> 03:02:08,989
How's it hanging? We're making some extra money by selling in the city

2113
03:02:09,629 --> 03:02:11,629
We gotta make those bucks somehow

2114
03:02:11,629 --> 03:02:14,510
Gotta buy new gear gotta get new kicks. I want to be a car

2115
03:02:15,549 --> 03:02:19,069
Good thinking kk gotta have a way to get around honk honk

2116
03:02:20,030 --> 03:02:25,450
You like the big statue building it sucked took a lot of scrap

2117
03:02:26,010 --> 03:02:28,170
The other job we did was way better. It was big

2118
03:02:28,809 --> 03:02:31,180
It's gonna blow your mind. It was big

2119
03:02:31,899 --> 03:02:38,000
I don't think I need any items, but that's all I have is bagels

2120
03:02:38,719 --> 03:02:43,200
Okay, i'm gonna buy

2121
03:02:43,200 --> 03:02:46,010
I'm gonna buy two bagels

2122
03:02:46,090 --> 03:02:54,840
Because I don't think I have a heel right? I feel like there's probably a boss coming on here

2123
03:02:56,540 --> 03:03:03,579
Yeah, what kind of bagels do you like?

2124
03:03:04,379 --> 03:03:06,379
Uh, I like everything bagels

2125
03:03:07,079 --> 03:03:10,920
One problem with everything bagels though is you are going to have to clean your counter

2126
03:03:11,399 --> 03:03:14,360
Doesn't matter how careful you are doesn't matter what you use for a plate or a thing to hold it

2127
03:03:15,079 --> 03:03:16,799
um

2128
03:03:16,799 --> 03:03:18,079
little like

2129
03:03:18,079 --> 03:03:21,680
Bird seed is gonna be all over your entire counter and it's a pain absolute ass

2130
03:03:24,430 --> 03:03:26,430
You take a bite out of an everything bagel

2131
03:03:26,829 --> 03:03:29,629
It's like being at the beach like sand just gets in your underwear

2132
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:33,200
It's worth it

Oh, I thought it was gonna be yellow. The first one was yellow

2163
03:06:37,149 --> 03:06:42,139

03:10:42,829 --> 03:10:44,670
It's gigantic

2197
03:10:44,670 --> 03:10:48,000

03:19:39,530 --> 03:19:43,370
Yeah, I did a refresher course, but I didn't have any funny material to put here

You feel forced, don't you?

2378
03:30:21,280 --> 03:30:23,280

2596
03:47:28,479 --> 03:47:42,659
It's a dumpster. It looks like there's a pillow inside the poster is torn revealing a faded one underneath

2597
03:47:43,219 --> 03:47:53,659
Big shot autos take a ride around town and our special the rest is cut off. Should I go there now?

2598
03:47:53,979 --> 03:48:03,010
I'm assuming i'll get access to like the actual hub world again, right? I loved that guy. That guy was awesome

2599
03:48:04,049 --> 03:48:06,049
Oh, right. I was I forgot about this

2600
03:48:06,209 --> 03:48:20,340
Get it first. We have to drive to find noel

2601
03:48:21,309 --> 03:48:24,000
Turn on the high beams

2602
03:48:24,479 --> 03:48:27,649
When she sees the queen's signal she will come running

2603
03:48:29,600 --> 03:48:30,959
Why?

2604
03:48:30,959 --> 03:48:32,959
Need to find noel so badly

2605
03:48:33,520 --> 03:48:36,340
What are you saying? The city is dangerous

2606
03:48:36,819 --> 03:48:39,299
Imagine poor noel clipping into a wall somewhere

2607
03:48:42,459 --> 03:48:44,719
wasting away from potassium deficiency

2608
03:48:46,610 --> 03:48:51,569
You're actually worried about her. It would be if I wasn't going to find her

2609
03:48:54,450 --> 03:48:55,409
uh, but

2610
03:48:55,409 --> 03:48:56,770
Why her?

2611
03:48:56,770 --> 03:49:03,250
Wait, let me guess is it because she's weak enough to make it and you can make me and make the person into a peon

2612
03:49:04,610 --> 03:49:07,360
No, just the opposite

2613
03:49:07,840 --> 03:49:11,979
It's because she's strong. What? Huh?

2614
03:49:13,260 --> 03:49:18,000
Let's stop the car. What's wrong with it?

2615
03:49:19,040 --> 03:49:21,040
um

2616
03:49:21,600 --> 03:49:24,719
I was just concerned because it hadn't exploded yet

2617
03:49:26,450 --> 03:49:28,450
Looks like we'll have to split up on foot

2618
03:49:31,020 --> 03:49:32,299
She's such a

2619
03:49:32,299 --> 03:49:33,979
weirdo

2620
03:49:33,979 --> 03:49:40,479
Chris if you see noel tell her my knowledge of her preferences is absolute and if she needs proof

2621
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:44,610
Use this queen's mixtape was thrown into your key items

2622
03:49:45,969 --> 03:49:56,260
Toodles for you somehow. I feel like we're almost out of here

2623
03:49:56,899 --> 03:50:11,979
Let's go chris check on lancer. Hey, thanks for the tape. I was hungry push my tummy to hear a cool song. That's it

2624
03:50:33,659 --> 03:50:39,809
Nice gosh, that was close. Wasn't it chris?

2625
03:50:40,690 --> 03:50:49,040
This strange world this big city. It's so wild. It kind of makes my head spin looks like another puzzle

2626
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:52,000
Maybe if I go down here

2627
03:50:52,159 --> 03:50:54,930
okay

2628
03:50:54,930 --> 03:51:02,739
e e

2629
03:51:04,459 --> 03:51:11,040
E e I said the city makes my head spin

2630
03:51:11,920 --> 03:51:13,920
I didn't mean in a bad way, you know

2631
03:51:14,079 --> 03:51:16,079
I was wanting to go someplace new, you know

2632
03:51:17,680 --> 03:51:20,639
E e c and des always told me she'd take me

2633
03:51:21,360 --> 03:51:23,790
Somewhere like this

2634
03:51:23,870 --> 03:51:27,629
Somewhere with shining lights e e c

2635
03:51:30,530 --> 03:51:32,530
e

2636
03:51:32,530 --> 03:51:36,540
C why don't you miss exploring chris back when the four of us were kids?

2637
03:51:37,340 --> 03:51:46,659
Gosh, remember that night. We explored the forest behind the graveyard. He's

2638
03:51:48,260 --> 03:51:49,860
December

2639
03:51:49,860 --> 03:51:54,500
I know we never found anything interesting back there. I mostly remember crying because I was scared

2640
03:52:01,920 --> 03:52:04,540
december

2641
03:52:08,370 --> 03:52:10,530
For some reason I feel nostalgic thinking about it

2642
03:52:11,979 --> 03:52:13,250
Yes

2643
03:52:13,250 --> 03:52:16,610
Yes wiping away my tears with the warm sleeves that smell like cinnamon

2644
03:52:17,090 --> 03:52:21,729
I guess I didn't mind being scared if it meant someone would comfort me

2645
03:52:22,690 --> 03:52:36,110
December chris is the only one who knows how weird I am. It's not fair. You know

2646
03:52:36,750 --> 03:52:39,120
Everyone knows how weird you are

2647
03:52:43,260 --> 03:52:53,010
December we got deals the ball throwing game prizes are seated under the counter

2648
03:52:56,350 --> 03:53:02,430
Ball throwing game prizes are seated under the counter. It's a ball throwing game prizes are seated under the counter, right?

2649
03:53:03,229 --> 03:53:04,670
bottom

2650
03:53:04,670 --> 03:53:06,670
All throwing games. Does this matter?

2651
03:53:06,909 --> 03:53:11,020
Does placement of this stuff matter? I feel like it kind of I feel like it does why?

2652
03:53:15,059 --> 03:53:17,059
Oh, no, she's coming back

2653
03:53:17,299 --> 03:53:24,180
I'll hide in that stall

2654
03:53:24,180 --> 03:53:27,569
Hey, check this out

03:53:32,420 --> 03:53:36,079
Where's my prize?

2657
03:53:36,079 --> 03:53:38,000
Oh, um

2659
03:53:41,020 --> 03:53:44,209
Nice

2660
03:53:44,209 --> 03:53:46,209
Wait, I actually don't want this

2661
03:53:48,340 --> 03:53:51,340
Nobody does

2662
03:53:52,459 --> 03:53:54,459
How was that

2663
03:53:54,459 --> 03:53:57,979
Uh suzy, you're not supposed to attack people with it

2664
03:53:58,860 --> 03:54:03,579
Oh, yeah, watch me chris. There you are

Oh, yes, she is a real master at it chris

2668
03:54:20,290 --> 03:54:22,290
God teaching you sarcasm was a mistake

2669
03:54:23,840 --> 03:54:25,840
Hey

Oh chris, what's that you have there? Is that a gift for someone?

2671

2674
03:54:48,850 --> 03:54:58,579
Chris we took a break from trucing for one second and you're already back with suzy should have expected this

2675
03:55:00,299 --> 03:55:02,860
You couldn't keep up with my puzzle solving skills

2676
03:55:06,370 --> 03:55:10,340

Um, I guess i'll forgive you for now. See you chris. All right. Why the hell did you give it to birdly?

2680
03:55:25,870 --> 03:55:28,270
Why did you give it to birdly? What unexpected kindness?

2681
03:55:29,549 --> 03:55:33,569
Let's just get the hell out of here. Wait

Glad you're okay though

Since that stupid queen took you I was kind of worried. Yeah, I don't thump thump. That's the foot tap. Wait

2686
03:55:57,809 --> 03:55:59,809

That's right. We have a truce

2692
03:56:14,059 --> 03:56:16,059
Chris said I could be on your team

2693
03:56:17,020 --> 03:56:19,020
Oh really?

2694
03:56:19,260 --> 03:56:22,850
Well, if chris said so I guess didn't really want to kill you anyway

2695
03:56:26,670 --> 03:56:36,479
So get in line already. Oh, okay chris also said I should be behind suzy

2696
03:56:37,840 --> 03:56:39,840
Uh, well chris said so

2697
03:56:40,000 --> 03:56:42,719
Let's go

2698
03:56:42,719 --> 03:56:44,719
Guess i'll join too, but only for this room

2699
03:56:50,530 --> 03:56:52,500
Yeah

2700
03:56:52,500 --> 03:57:06,579
Our party is complete. That's funny. Oh save point. Um, I should probably go pee

2701
03:57:08,450 --> 03:57:10,450
Yeah, let's go. All right. Let me take a break

2702
03:57:10,530 --> 03:57:12,260
I'm gonna get some water

2703
03:57:12,260 --> 04:01:23,260
And we'll take a quick brb. I'll be back in like two or three minutes. I'm back

2704
04:01:23,659 --> 04:01:25,659
But I am crunching on some almonds

2705
04:01:26,620 --> 04:01:28,450
Good gamer snack

2706
04:01:28,450 --> 04:01:30,290
So give me one second

2707
04:01:30,290 --> 04:02:20,780
Yeah, i'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that just like roasted almonds like salted roasted almonds

2708
04:02:21,500 --> 04:02:24,379
That's the best gamer snack. It's quick

2709
04:02:24,940 --> 04:02:28,850
You don't need to eat very many of them

2710
04:02:28,850 --> 04:02:30,850
peanuts too, but especially almonds

2711
04:02:31,010 --> 04:02:32,909
They're calorie dense

2712
04:02:32,909 --> 04:02:36,190
They're nutrient dense

2713
04:02:36,190 --> 04:02:38,590
Very crunchy. They're very crunchy as you can tell

2714
04:02:39,229 --> 04:02:43,899
That was larry. I was just doing larry david

2715
04:02:44,299 --> 04:02:47,180
They're very crunchy very crunchy

2716
04:02:55,120 --> 04:03:11,780
All right, let's go chat monkey mode engage. All right, should I go up? All right

2717
04:03:12,959 --> 04:03:14,959
status report update

2718
04:03:15,360 --> 04:03:18,989
Those of you that have played this

2719
04:03:18,989 --> 04:03:21,790
How many more hours from now?

2720
04:03:22,510 --> 04:03:26,030
Until I've received the completion of chapter two's completion

2721
04:03:26,750 --> 04:03:31,780
Okay

2722
04:03:31,780 --> 04:03:35,790
About two to three hours at this pace about three or four hours. Okay

2723
04:03:36,670 --> 04:03:38,270
Okay

2724
04:03:38,270 --> 04:03:40,750
Okay, you're exactly halfway through

2725
04:03:41,899 --> 04:03:44,700
Really?

2726
04:03:44,700 --> 04:03:46,540
About two or three. Okay

2727
04:03:46,540 --> 04:03:51,489
Okay

2728
04:03:51,489 --> 04:03:52,370
so

2729
04:03:52,370 --> 04:03:54,370
Well, here's what's probably gonna happen

2730
04:03:54,370 --> 04:03:59,940
We're gonna go for a little longer

2731
04:03:59,940 --> 04:04:01,940
Probably like another hour i'd say

2732
04:04:04,670 --> 04:04:06,670
and then tomorrow

2733
04:04:06,989 --> 04:04:10,829
We're gonna open with this i'm gonna complete it and then we'll move on to the umbrella game

2734
04:04:11,309 --> 04:04:14,770
Cuz I don't I don't want like blow through this

2735
04:04:14,930 --> 04:04:20,190
You know what I mean? I don't want to just like

2736
04:04:20,190 --> 04:04:23,870
Do a seven hour stream and like eight hour stream blow throughs and just forget it tomorrow

2737
04:04:24,510 --> 04:04:27,969
You also have to do the secret boss i'll try

2738
04:04:31,170 --> 04:04:33,409
All right, so we'll go for like another hour. Let's go

2739
04:04:34,129 --> 04:05:03,360
I take the stairs of the teacups. What's the point of that? Wait, I know. Um to turn up that force field

2740
04:05:05,229 --> 04:05:07,229
Just stay standing on this switch

2741
04:05:07,809 --> 04:05:10,739
Huh?

2742
04:05:10,739 --> 04:05:12,180
Well, see you later

2743
04:05:12,180 --> 04:05:14,959
Wait, what?

2744
04:05:14,959 --> 04:05:16,000
Okay

2745
04:05:16,000 --> 04:05:26,959
The treasure of air where three are one place one to three

2746
04:05:27,680 --> 04:05:31,389
Perhaps it means we all have to enter one teacup

2747
04:05:32,879 --> 04:05:35,120
I don't like doing it but it works

2748
04:05:35,120 --> 04:05:47,860
Okay, you're eating a tuna melt

2749
04:05:50,000 --> 04:05:51,120
I wish

2750
04:05:51,120 --> 04:05:52,719
For a split second

2751
04:05:52,719 --> 04:05:58,000
And I mean like one full second I could snap my fingers and just be you for one second

2752
04:05:59,149 --> 04:06:00,750
Right when you take a bite

2753
04:06:00,750 --> 04:06:05,549
Like you bite down. I mean i'm you now i'm not you. I just I you know what I mean god

2754
04:06:06,270 --> 04:06:08,659
I just want to be you for one second

2755
04:06:08,659 --> 04:06:10,979
It's like I want to eat that delicious fucking tuna milk

2756
04:06:11,620 --> 04:06:23,709
Okay, you want to possess some no I

2757
04:06:24,350 --> 04:06:29,379
Wait, what happened? Did it work?

2758
04:06:29,379 --> 04:06:32,020
Why are you so high? No, I what are you talking about?

2759
04:06:37,569 --> 04:06:39,809
Well, do we have tuna haters in the chat right here?

2760
04:06:40,370 --> 04:06:42,799
Like a tuna fish a tuna fish sandwich

2761
04:06:45,709 --> 04:06:47,069
We don't right?

2762
04:06:47,069 --> 04:06:55,299
There's nothing in here

2763
04:06:55,299 --> 04:07:02,979
All for nothing. Tuna is good. Just don't take too long. Okay, wait

2764
04:07:03,620 --> 04:07:08,559
Do more silence

2765
04:07:08,559 --> 04:07:14,930
Tuna is amazing

2766
04:07:14,930 --> 04:07:17,170
Well, let me rephrase that I like tuna

2767
04:07:18,049 --> 04:07:20,370
I hold on. Sorry. Let me redo that

2768
04:07:21,250 --> 04:07:22,450
I like

2769
04:07:22,450 --> 04:07:24,020
tuna

2770
04:07:24,020 --> 04:07:25,139
but

2771
04:07:25,139 --> 04:07:29,379
It has to be cooked all the way through i'm talking tuna from the can

2772
04:07:29,940 --> 04:07:37,659
Let me show you my ultimate healing move

2773
04:07:37,659 --> 04:07:39,100
Get hit

2774
04:07:39,100 --> 04:07:40,379
avoid

2775
04:07:40,379 --> 04:08:02,430
Lucy told you to avoid getting hit by the ambulances. Okay. I smell like ice proful

2776
04:08:03,049 --> 04:08:04,909
isopropyl alcohol

2777
04:08:04,909 --> 04:08:12,319
It was amazing from the can

2778
04:08:12,319 --> 04:08:14,959
Yeah, that's how I like it like that. You take it out of the can

2779
04:08:15,520 --> 04:08:17,280
You mush it up with a fork

2780
04:08:17,280 --> 04:08:20,639
You get it to I don't know this might sound gross, but it's not

2781
04:08:21,600 --> 04:08:28,079
You get it to a paste consistency slightly chunky. Don't go too crazy. So it's not like like baby puke. You know what I mean?

2782
04:08:35,729 --> 04:08:37,729
Hat food. Yeah, what's okay? Sure

2783
04:08:41,059 --> 04:08:43,219
So, um, why are you all writing a teacup together?

2784
04:08:51,020 --> 04:08:54,670
Nuclear bunker andy

2785
04:08:54,750 --> 04:08:56,829
No, you have no idea going to school

2786
04:08:57,709 --> 04:09:00,299
opening up my lunch

2787
04:09:00,299 --> 04:09:02,219
and I had

2788
04:09:02,219 --> 04:09:04,459
Tuna sandwich in there. That was a big deal

2789
04:09:05,260 --> 04:09:09,969
It's like wait mom. What's in there? What's the sandwich?

2790
04:09:10,770 --> 04:09:15,729
Usually it would be just like bologna and american cheese, right? Oh man. What if it was tuna fish?

2791
04:09:15,809 --> 04:09:17,809
We were eating that day

2792
04:09:17,969 --> 04:09:19,969
It was amazing if that was in there

2793
04:09:25,540 --> 04:09:27,540
I would eat it so fast

2794
04:09:31,520 --> 04:09:33,139
too fast

2795
04:09:33,139 --> 04:09:35,139
We were eating fast that day

2796
04:09:44,270 --> 04:09:48,030
Wait, where'd they all go? Oh, wait, isn't the hacker do this?

2797
04:10:01,139 --> 04:10:02,899
You're being invaded

2798
04:10:02,899 --> 04:10:06,850
Wait, I don't want to pop the balloons

2799
04:10:06,850 --> 04:10:09,579
No, I want to keep the balloons

2800
04:10:09,579 --> 04:10:11,280
Oh no

2801
04:10:11,280 --> 04:10:12,319
cheese

2802
04:10:12,319 --> 04:10:16,299
All right. Can I get all three of them?

2803
04:10:16,299 --> 04:10:34,670
Uh, we'll do that. All right being pushed around

2804
04:10:42,590 --> 04:10:44,590
Spare well now let's actually act

2805
04:10:46,879 --> 04:10:48,319
crap all

2806
04:10:48,319 --> 04:10:52,610
spare

2807
04:10:52,610 --> 04:10:57,500
Shit. All right. I got you

2808
04:10:57,500 --> 04:11:00,299
Gamble time i'm doing a scratch off ticket if I win money i'll give subs

2809
04:11:00,379 --> 04:11:03,420
Let's bet how much I'll win if you get it right you get 30 of when I win

2810
04:11:05,200 --> 04:11:06,239
um

2811
04:11:06,239 --> 04:11:11,659
Here's what's gonna happen. You are going to scratch off. Let's say that there's eight slots

2812
04:11:12,930 --> 04:11:15,170
Eight slots, right?

2813
04:11:15,170 --> 04:11:20,450
You're gonna win on every single one of them. You're gonna win on all eight. You're gonna match eight of your numbers

2814
04:11:20,450 --> 04:11:22,450
You're gonna be freaking out

2815
04:11:22,450 --> 04:11:27,260
And you're gonna go to the bottom to see what you won and it's gonna be two dollars for each slot

2816
04:11:29,149 --> 04:11:31,149
Now that's the worst

2817
04:11:31,969 --> 04:11:35,649
But you know this time this time. Here's what I want to hope happens

2818
04:11:36,209 --> 04:11:40,930
Hope this time you get one just instant win. You don't have to match any numbers or anything

2819
04:11:41,569 --> 04:11:43,010
Don't have to match

2820
04:11:43,010 --> 04:11:45,010
And it's like a hundred thousand dollars

2821
04:11:45,250 --> 04:11:46,930
Hope that happens to you

2822
04:11:46,930 --> 04:11:53,340
And I don't want you to give me any of it goals in the chat

2823
04:11:53,979 --> 04:11:56,100
What's up job?

2824
04:11:56,100 --> 04:11:58,780
What's going on?

2825
04:11:58,780 --> 04:12:02,540
I just what you just you don't have to like you're just watching. He's just hanging out

2826
04:12:07,219 --> 04:12:11,629
Hey, I hope you win a hundred thousand. I might let me do it. Do I like the game? Yeah

2827
04:12:12,350 --> 04:12:13,790
I think it's really good

2828
04:12:13,790 --> 04:12:18,399
It's really fun. Really funny. How the fuck are you doing?

2829
04:12:18,959 --> 04:12:24,750
You're gonna hang out sometime. We still have like the the first

2830
04:12:25,149 --> 04:12:27,229
Um part of the second half of the tutorial

2831
04:12:27,950 --> 04:12:29,950
In halo infinite, so

2832
04:12:32,290 --> 04:12:44,700
I mean, I mean if you're around

2833
04:12:44,700 --> 04:12:47,659
I I don't like this spiders and finding vasik are the worst

2834
04:12:57,440 --> 04:12:58,799
There we go

2835
04:12:58,799 --> 04:13:02,860
Hey

2836
04:13:02,860 --> 04:13:04,139
Susie

2837
04:13:04,139 --> 04:13:06,620
The hell you blaming me for you made the trap what?

2838
04:13:14,159 --> 04:13:17,520
Oh, it tricked me. I don't like this one. I'm very hard at this one

2839
04:13:18,239 --> 04:13:31,889
She ate the cheese. This is the time that you played halo on impossible difficulty and hated it. Yes

2840
04:13:32,690 --> 04:13:36,780
The only time i've ever played halo in my life

2841
04:13:37,500 --> 04:13:39,420
We played it on impossible

2842
04:13:39,420 --> 04:13:41,420
And we didn't even make it out of the tutorial

2843
04:13:42,030 --> 04:13:44,190
And I never played it again and I hate the series

2844
04:13:45,069 --> 04:13:46,989
That's so fucked up

2845
04:13:46,989 --> 04:13:51,780
Oh, wait a second. Where's noelle?

2846
04:13:51,780 --> 04:13:54,500
Sorry, I just never seen fireworks up close before

2847
04:13:56,059 --> 04:13:58,059
Fuck you for that. What?

2848
04:13:59,409 --> 04:14:01,409
Those bullets what you scared?

2849
04:14:01,969 --> 04:14:05,250
Uh, um, I guess so. Maybe that's uh, why I couldn't stop watching

2850
04:14:06,450 --> 04:14:19,819
Fuck you for doing that zero to catch mice

2851
04:14:22,750 --> 04:14:27,760
Okay, so how do we you put the mice in the hole?

2852
04:14:29,500 --> 04:14:31,500
Ah, okay. I get it

2853
04:14:31,500 --> 04:14:35,680
Wait, I need a mouse

2854
04:14:35,680 --> 04:14:41,700
Where do I get a mouse?

2855
04:14:41,700 --> 04:14:43,700
Oh, okay. You have to let him go

2856
04:14:44,100 --> 04:14:54,540
What do I think about the final smash dlc fighter? I don't even know who it is

2857
04:14:54,940 --> 04:15:05,260
Wait, I don't think they even announced it yet. Are they announcing it like next week 20 more?

2858
04:15:07,520 --> 04:15:10,479
Maybe if we um split up the world. I wonder who it's gonna be obviously honestly

2859
04:15:11,040 --> 04:15:14,059
because

2860
04:15:14,059 --> 04:15:16,620
This is the last smash character ever right?

2861
04:15:17,979 --> 04:15:21,020
I don't know. Are they gonna make another smash brothers? They kind of can't

2862
04:15:23,549 --> 04:15:27,469
If they make another smash brothers, they can't who they're gonna add for characters like mr clean

2863
04:15:28,110 --> 04:15:39,700
How are they gonna do this again make a prediction? I'm gonna make a prediction. Um, yeah

2864
04:15:40,020 --> 04:15:45,780
Unless they start adding serial mascots. There's no way there's gonna be another smash brothers. I'm gonna say because okay

2865
04:15:46,500 --> 04:15:50,100
They're either gonna do one of two things. The first thing they're gonna do is they're gonna do some

2866
04:15:50,899 --> 04:15:54,829
Incredibly iconic video game character that is not there yet

2867
04:15:55,790 --> 04:15:58,850
Like I don't know

2868
04:15:59,170 --> 04:16:02,899
Like the doom guy, right?

2869
04:16:02,899 --> 04:16:08,739
I saw that floating around before and that would make a little bit sense like oh doom like gaming history, right?

2870
04:16:09,139 --> 04:16:15,250
but what they probably are gonna do it's probably gonna be crash bandicoot because

2871
04:16:16,049 --> 04:16:18,049
That would be the ultimate

2872
04:16:18,620 --> 04:16:19,799
nintendo

2873
04:16:19,799 --> 04:16:21,340
microsoft

2874
04:16:21,340 --> 04:16:25,979
Collaboration between every third party. It's probably gonna be crash bandicoot. It probably will

2875
04:16:28,459 --> 04:16:30,459
It's like playstation sony sega

2876
04:16:31,219 --> 04:16:37,899
Microsoft i'll tell you. Oh, all right. All right. Here's a prediction. I'll make that will make me really upset

2877
04:16:38,379 --> 04:16:41,870
It better not be a fire emblem character, right?

2878
04:16:42,909 --> 04:16:50,940
That would be like you can't do that for the final character if it wasn't gonna be crash bandicoot or so. I don't know

2879
04:16:53,329 --> 04:16:54,129
I

2880
04:16:54,129 --> 04:16:55,729
Shinkuro Miyamoto

2881
04:16:55,729 --> 04:17:06,940
Can I say like that? I don't know that might that would be actually that could happen. It's not gonna be waluigi

2882
04:17:07,020 --> 04:17:22,750
No that that that unless it was it april 1st. Hope they put mario in phoenix, right?

2883
04:17:22,750 --> 04:17:24,750
I don't know if phoenix right is gonna be the last character

2884
04:17:24,750 --> 04:17:34,510
I'm trying to think of anybody else that I think would actually be in the final slot

2885
04:17:34,989 --> 04:17:42,459
I know i'm sorry. I'll play the game play again. I'll give me one more second crash bandicoot doom guy

2886
04:17:42,620 --> 04:17:44,239
Shigeru Miyamoto

2887
04:17:44,239 --> 04:17:46,239
Or i'll give you one like the top four

2888
04:17:49,069 --> 04:17:54,370
um

2889
04:17:54,370 --> 04:17:56,209
Fucking ronald mcdonald

2890
04:17:56,209 --> 04:17:58,959
I don't know. That'd be awesome

2891
04:17:59,200 --> 04:18:03,790
I would okay. Let me ask you would you be upset?

2892
04:18:04,350 --> 04:18:14,350
If ronald mcdonald was the last character. No, you'd be you'd be so happy everybody would go crazy

2893
04:18:19,229 --> 04:18:22,909
I've said this before but I tell you where they really messed up is not putting scrooge mcduck in the game because that was

2894
04:18:22,909 --> 04:18:28,110
A classic nintendo game. He has a move set that makes perfect sense. He's got the pogo. He's got the gems

2895
04:18:28,110 --> 04:18:29,629
He's got the golf swing

2896
04:18:29,629 --> 04:18:33,069
It was a mistake to not put him in there and you already have disney bullshit in the game with the

2897
04:18:34,190 --> 04:18:44,670
Wait, do they have disney bullshit in the game? Is there disney bullshit in the game? Fuck. It's gonna be sora

2898
04:18:45,760 --> 04:18:48,879
No, it's not nobody cares about kingdom hearts right now. That should have been like a year ago

2899
04:18:48,959 --> 04:18:59,840
No, it's not gonna be sora now. Okay. I would have agreed with sora if this was like

2900
04:19:00,379 --> 04:19:01,600
2019

2901
04:19:01,600 --> 04:19:07,629
Like early 2020. Nope too late rayman would be cool

2902
04:19:07,950 --> 04:19:11,149
All right, i'll release the mice susie will break the balloons when they reach the top

2903
04:19:11,469 --> 04:19:18,879
Chrono from chrono trigger. No, oh, they don't give a shit about that franchise

2904
04:19:22,979 --> 04:19:26,340
Susie will break the balloons when they reach the top and chris you catch them

2905
04:19:26,819 --> 04:19:33,200
Okay, they picked the characters in november 2019. Oh, that's you know, that's right

2906
04:19:34,610 --> 04:19:36,770
That's actually correct. It really might be sora

2907
04:19:37,649 --> 04:19:39,649
But don't you think you would do that?

2908
04:19:40,319 --> 04:19:42,319
Not as the last character

2909
04:19:44,399 --> 04:19:45,920
All right, hold on

2910
04:19:45,920 --> 04:19:48,719
Because honestly if you had okay the final character

2911
04:19:49,360 --> 04:19:50,879
Of the dlc

2912
04:19:50,879 --> 04:19:52,879
Should be banjo kazooie

2913
04:19:52,879 --> 04:19:56,579
Right unless you got somebody better than that. Think about it

2914
04:19:58,530 --> 04:20:02,690
Who have they put in the game so far that has like a huge impact on all of video games?

2915
04:20:03,170 --> 04:20:05,440
Is that i'm very bad at this

2916
04:20:05,440 --> 04:20:09,340
I'm saying like who could it be possibly that's that's more

2917
04:20:10,139 --> 04:20:16,959
Ridiculous than banjo minecraft steve. Yeah

2918
04:20:18,139 --> 04:20:20,860
But then who would the final person be it's not gonna be sora

2919
04:20:23,760 --> 04:20:28,639
If it was gonna be sora sora would have been announced where banjo was announced and banjo would be the last character

2920
04:20:28,719 --> 04:20:30,159
You see what i'm saying?

2921
04:20:30,159 --> 04:20:34,000
Because kingdom hearts 3 was relevant back then not now

2922
04:20:38,209 --> 04:20:49,069
Master chief, I don't know about that. Oh, yeah, take that you stupid mice. I'm seeing you enjoy puzzles susie

2923
04:20:50,690 --> 04:20:52,690
They aren't awful if you do them like that

2924
04:20:53,409 --> 04:21:02,030
Not bad. Well, that was kind of smart. Maybe a tetris block. Yeah

2925
04:21:02,909 --> 04:21:05,729
I mean nobody really thought that piranha plant was gonna be in the game

2926
04:21:05,969 --> 04:21:13,790
But that kind of just came out of nowhere. Can I?

2927
04:21:14,510 --> 04:21:19,569
Okay, let's i gotta pay attention to the game, but you have my thoughts crash bandicoot doom guy. Shigeru Miyamoto

2928
04:21:20,270 --> 04:21:21,389
uh

2929
04:21:21,389 --> 04:21:24,590
a regular nintendo nes where the controllers are your arms

2930
04:21:25,629 --> 04:21:27,309
and like two

2931
04:21:27,309 --> 04:21:30,829
Nes light guns are your legs. There's also I don't know maybe a possibility

2932
04:21:40,799 --> 04:21:48,530
Need one

2933
04:21:48,530 --> 04:21:50,530
He's so high

2934
04:21:52,340 --> 04:21:54,260
Oh

2935
04:21:54,260 --> 04:21:56,430
Look, we're finally close to the fountain

2936
04:21:56,510 --> 04:21:58,510
It's queen's mansion

2937
04:21:58,590 --> 04:22:01,149
Oh, what why did we come here?

2938
04:22:04,450 --> 04:22:06,610
Chris you brought noelle right to me

2939
04:22:07,329 --> 04:22:09,329
I knew our truce was the best

2940
04:22:09,489 --> 04:22:13,090
But unfortunately, that means truces are over

2941
04:22:13,969 --> 04:22:16,340
Noelle get over here

2942
04:22:16,340 --> 04:22:17,940
but I

2943
04:22:17,940 --> 04:22:20,879
Noelle I will only say it one time

2944
04:22:21,979 --> 04:22:25,760
Infinitely get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here

2945
04:22:27,020 --> 04:22:29,659
I noelle are you hesitating?

2946
04:22:30,690 --> 04:22:33,010
Let me if then this for you

2947
04:22:33,569 --> 04:22:35,760
how about if

2948
04:22:35,760 --> 04:22:40,719
You don't listen then a certain bird might take a ride in the acid river

2949
04:22:42,219 --> 04:22:43,500
birdly

2950
04:22:43,500 --> 04:22:47,090
That's right. He was just with us

2951
04:22:47,090 --> 04:22:49,250
We must have captured him and we weren't looking

2952
04:22:49,889 --> 04:22:56,610
I'm sorry chris suzy. I

2953
04:22:56,930 --> 04:22:58,930
I wish I could have stayed with you longer

2954
04:22:59,409 --> 04:23:02,159
I can't let birdly get hurt, you know

2955
04:23:02,239 --> 04:23:07,729
Don't be sad noelle, honey

2956
04:23:07,809 --> 04:23:09,809
All that remains is the final step

2957
04:23:11,840 --> 04:23:13,840
A splendorous queen. There you are

2958
04:23:14,829 --> 04:23:17,870
Sorry, I thought I saw you in a used game store and

2959
04:23:19,069 --> 04:23:27,729
Oh noelle, are you okay? You look a little funny. Okay plan b

2960
04:23:30,579 --> 04:23:32,819
Yep, jerd, huh?

2961
04:23:32,979 --> 04:23:34,500
What are you doing?

2962
04:23:34,500 --> 04:23:37,780
I see now her will must be unleashed by force

2963
04:23:38,340 --> 04:23:41,139
Perhaps if I make her face into a robot one

2964
04:23:43,420 --> 04:23:45,420
You said you wouldn't do that if I

2965
04:23:46,399 --> 04:23:53,790
Variable lying set to true we were going to be smart together. That's not fair understood

2966
04:23:54,670 --> 04:23:57,979
fairness activated

2967
04:23:57,979 --> 04:24:04,639
Hey, the thing I calibrated those cages. You said I could trust you

2968
04:24:05,200 --> 04:24:09,139
What do you know? How do I know I could trust you? You said you were a gamer

2969
04:24:10,879 --> 04:24:13,840
Birdly I only play mobile games

2970
04:24:16,909 --> 04:24:18,909
One of you is going to help me with my plan

2971
04:24:19,729 --> 04:24:21,729
And it's going to be noelle

2972
04:24:23,059 --> 04:24:25,139
The rest of you go to your rooms

2973
04:24:26,909 --> 04:24:33,700
I only play mobile games not a real gamer. What are you going to do with me?

2974
04:24:36,290 --> 04:24:37,489
Damn

2975
04:24:37,489 --> 04:24:40,500
You're still here. I only made four cages

2976
04:24:41,219 --> 04:24:43,840
I literally don't know

2977
04:24:50,059 --> 04:24:52,059
How do you like your new room units

2978
04:24:52,639 --> 04:24:58,290
As you can see they are perfectly suited to your interests which I gleaned from your internet search results

2979
04:24:59,149 --> 04:25:01,389
I estimate you will have no desire to leave

2980
04:25:02,190 --> 04:25:08,920
Please tantalize yourself with your surroundings and wait patiently while I dominate the world toodles

2981
04:25:12,420 --> 04:25:18,610
Chris hey, can you hear me? It's like there's some way to communicate between rooms

2982
04:25:19,819 --> 04:25:21,819
Convenient, isn't it? I really thought of everything

2983
04:25:22,620 --> 04:25:23,659
Shut up

2984
04:25:23,659 --> 04:25:25,819
Anyway, let's think of some way to get out of here

2985
04:25:26,700 --> 04:25:29,020
Rousey you got any bright ideas?

2986
04:25:30,909 --> 04:25:34,299
Uh, hey, where the hell's rousey?

2987
04:25:35,020 --> 04:25:37,020
Damn, that's soft yet tender screaming

2988
04:25:37,579 --> 04:25:39,500
Chris that's gotta be him

2989
04:25:39,500 --> 04:25:54,780
Quick, we gotta think of some way to get out anything you smuggled in that might help us lancer

2990
04:25:55,260 --> 04:25:59,629
Should I take the lancer cookie?

2991
04:25:59,629 --> 04:26:06,819
Maybe he'll come out and help. Oh, it's me lancer release me and I will release you

2992
04:26:11,139 --> 04:26:12,659
Miss me

2993
04:26:12,659 --> 04:26:15,360
Because I missed you

2994
04:26:15,360 --> 04:26:17,680
Lancer that you I thought you ditched us

2995
04:26:18,579 --> 04:26:20,579
No, I love ditches, but I never did you

2996
04:26:21,579 --> 04:26:24,219
I was simply relaxing in Chris's spacious pants. Oh

2997
04:26:26,079 --> 04:26:27,680
Oh pocket

2998
04:26:27,680 --> 04:26:29,680

3000
04:26:32,829 --> 04:26:39,280
A wild mom puts you in some shock cages. Uh, yeah, we're trapped. So, uh

3001
04:26:39,920 --> 04:26:42,559
Hey, wait, did you see us on the roller coaster?

3002
04:26:43,540 --> 04:26:45,860
Yes, it was amazing. My first coaster ride ever

3003
04:26:47,059 --> 04:26:49,059
I love getting nauseous with friends

3004
04:26:52,399 --> 04:26:54,639
Hey, you should probably uh free us

3005
04:26:54,879 --> 04:26:56,479
Oh right. Yes

3006
04:26:56,479 --> 04:26:58,479
You can always rely on friendly me

3007
04:26:58,639 --> 04:27:03,569
I almost swallowed. I must have choked on my own saliva to make you free

3008

I have no idea how to use this

3009
04:27:09,920 --> 04:27:12,319
Request new item for room. That sounds good

3010
04:27:13,200 --> 04:27:14,799
I think before I shovel

3011
04:27:14,799 --> 04:27:17,170

Hey, we don't have time for this. It's dozens and dozens of bath bombs from search query diy bath bomb. All right, let's go

3027
04:28:44,290 --> 04:28:45,489
Chris. Hey

04:28:45,489 --> 04:28:49,250
Man lancer, you're the best

04:28:49,250 --> 04:28:51,250
Come on. Noel and rousey are waiting

3030
04:28:52,159 --> 04:28:53,200
Yes

3031
04:28:53,200 --> 04:28:55,200
Let's put the pedal on the metal

3032
04:28:58,989 --> 04:29:01,680
What

3033
04:29:01,680 --> 04:29:06,750
Hey lancer, are you okay? I i'm fine. I'm just very cold

3034
04:29:08,979 --> 04:29:12,239
Hey, what the hell I

3035
04:29:13,600 --> 04:29:22,899
Are you okay, dude? Here? Let me help you. Thanks. Sure. See but I

3036
04:29:24,579 --> 04:29:33,809
It's not strong enough. Quick chris. Let's find rousey. Maybe he can heal him. Wait, wait

3037
04:29:35,040 --> 04:29:38,930
You two aren't going to leave without me. Are you? Uh, yeah, we are

3038
04:29:40,049 --> 04:29:42,530
But no, well my damsel in distress. She must be

3039
04:29:43,340 --> 04:29:45,819
In distress, I I cannot help with it

3040
04:29:46,780 --> 04:29:55,069
Okay, fine. Come with us. Shut up the nameplate reads

3041
04:29:55,709 --> 04:29:59,229
Burgly, I mean birdly peek inside. Yes

3042
04:29:59,950 --> 04:30:08,700
But you saw surprised you sort of nameplate reads caddy's room peek inside. Sure

3043
04:30:09,979 --> 04:30:20,299
Wallpapered with the pink cat ad from the city. It's animated too nameplate reads

3044
04:30:20,920 --> 04:30:35,329
Jockington's room peek inside beautiful. Is there a save point? You've escaped from your second personalized room of the day

3045
04:30:35,649 --> 04:30:38,020
You're filled with the power of vacation homes

3046
04:30:38,180 --> 04:30:49,920
This is an ideal stopping point just so you know, the final act of the chapter kind of starts here. Oh, okay

3047
04:30:51,379 --> 04:30:55,459
um

3048
04:30:55,459 --> 04:30:56,719
Okay

3049
04:30:56,719 --> 04:30:58,719
This is like we're going to like the final like hour or two

3050
04:31:01,170 --> 04:31:03,170
ban that guy

3051
04:31:03,969 --> 04:31:06,860
Um, hold on just a minute because

3052
04:31:07,420 --> 04:31:12,479
Oh, it's all the shovels

3053
04:31:12,479 --> 04:31:16,719
Seems like the room is overflowing with shovels and you don't have anything to dig through them with

3054
04:31:18,430 --> 04:31:20,430
Who said that?

3055
04:31:24,639 --> 04:31:31,549
Whoa, it's a copy of an online skateboarding game from search query cool skateboarding game online

3056
04:31:34,209 --> 04:31:36,209
somewhat glitched out hologram

3057
04:31:36,979 --> 04:31:39,649
from the search query

3058
04:31:39,649 --> 04:31:41,180
uh

3059
04:31:41,180 --> 04:31:49,389
Accidental smash on the keyboard. Susie's talktube thing looks a bit bigger for her larger head an egg

3060
04:31:50,340 --> 04:31:52,270
Painted egg. It's warm

3061
04:31:52,270 --> 04:31:54,909
from can harboil eggs hatch

3062
04:31:57,360 --> 04:32:14,639
Vacuum powered book from search query losers. This library sucks. Can I go in any of the rooms?

3063
04:32:15,040 --> 04:32:26,829
You respected the gamer's code. No screen peeking. You can smell the glittery cat food from here. Anyways

3064
04:32:30,319 --> 04:32:31,840
Uh, let's know

3065
04:32:31,840 --> 04:32:33,840
You feel like noelle would enjoy this more

3066
04:32:37,250 --> 04:32:39,250
Asriel's room peek inside. Yes

3067
04:32:39,809 --> 04:32:55,600
You opened the door with your eyes closed. You saw nothing for the feeling. You wouldn't learn anything. It was like a puzzle

3068
04:32:56,799 --> 04:32:58,000
think uh

3069
04:32:58,000 --> 04:33:00,000
Think you can do it chris

3070
04:33:02,180 --> 04:33:06,979
On your skinless boneless thighs everyone. I'll think of a solution

3071
04:33:08,159 --> 04:33:11,119
Chris just ignore him. I'll just be over here where I can't hear you

3072
04:33:12,860 --> 04:33:16,299
Now be here away from your iq debuffing aura

3073
04:33:16,860 --> 04:33:24,819
These dark bulbs will cast a bright shadow on the ground

3074
04:33:26,619 --> 04:33:31,180
Why are you doing a castle griffin state voice? I don't know because he's like i'm a hero. I'm a champion

3075
04:33:31,740 --> 04:33:33,979
He's like larping. So that's why

3076
04:33:34,380 --> 04:33:39,060
Fill in the space with dark to unlock the way

3077
04:33:43,389 --> 04:33:47,939
All right. See you tomorrow. Oh fuck. I can't leave

3078
04:33:49,779 --> 04:33:54,900
Ah chris still stumped by this simple diversion. That'll put your neurons back in the crayon box chris

3079
04:33:55,299 --> 04:33:58,099
I can already feel the solution welling up in my brain cavity

3080
04:33:59,700 --> 04:34:01,700
That's what I will say now go

3081
04:34:03,630 --> 04:34:06,590
Uh, I saved it back there

3082
04:34:06,590 --> 04:34:10,029
Yeah, all right if this is a good stopping point then this is a good stopping point i'm gonna i'm streaming tomorrow

3083
04:34:11,139 --> 04:34:27,549
But I would we're doing two days this weekend. So don't worry. This is a good point. Yeah, this is all right

3084
04:34:28,110 --> 04:34:31,500
So tomorrow might be a little longer than

3085
04:34:32,000 --> 04:34:35,500
Maybe because if this is only like another two hours, maybe

3086
04:34:36,060 --> 04:34:38,400
three hours

3087
04:34:38,400 --> 04:34:40,369
less

3088
04:34:40,369 --> 04:34:44,770
Than the umbrella game. Yeah, I think that makes sense

3089
04:34:45,169 --> 04:34:48,939
Because I think there's like two is there's like two or three hours in the umbrella game left

3090
04:34:49,580 --> 04:34:51,580
And there's like two hours left in this

3091
04:34:53,380 --> 04:34:54,979
So that's a

3092
04:34:54,979 --> 04:34:57,150
Should be like a five to six hour stream tomorrow

3093
04:35:03,819 --> 04:35:07,900
You have about two hours to completion if you do the secret area. Yeah, then that that makes sense then

3094
04:35:08,459 --> 04:35:12,639
Because I want time tomorrow to be able to well not time tomorrow. I want

3095
04:35:13,360 --> 04:35:18,049
Um, I want to have enough content tomorrow because I don't know if the umbrella game has more than an hour or two

3096
04:35:28,340 --> 04:35:34,669
Two hours pepe left for like three hours to be honest

3097
04:35:35,549 --> 04:35:37,549
Yeah, but I think we'll be okay

3098
04:35:40,110 --> 04:35:42,110
Depends on how long you take on some of the bosses. Yeah

3099
04:35:45,200 --> 04:35:47,919
And look tomorrow we can go a little long tomorrow. It's fine

3100
04:35:48,930 --> 04:35:52,290
I wanted to make sure I started it and got to a point where we could do it again tomorrow

3101
04:35:59,650 --> 04:36:06,540
Okay, and look I look if we if the next if it takes four or five hours to do tomorrow

3102
04:36:07,340 --> 04:36:13,299
Then whatever i'll play that that'll be it. I don't want to rush through this. That's the problem

3103
04:36:13,380 --> 04:36:15,380
I want to like take a time to like

3104
04:36:16,560 --> 04:36:21,970
Actually take in the information and stuff because before I don't know if you guys remember

3105
04:36:22,610 --> 04:36:27,169
If a game was like seven to eight hours before like seven ish hours

3106
04:36:27,330 --> 04:36:29,729
I would just blow through the whole thing in one stream sometimes

3107
04:36:30,290 --> 04:36:33,169
And then just be done with it and then just like okay, that's it. See you later

3108
04:36:33,889 --> 04:36:36,130
Um, I really want to like process this shit

3109
04:36:36,689 --> 04:36:38,689
It's like i've been waiting for this game to come out for a while

3110
04:36:39,169 --> 04:36:45,229
I don't just want to like just inhale like eight hours of a gamer session and just forget the whole game

3111
04:36:45,630 --> 04:36:48,930
I need my turtle half to process the game

3112
04:36:51,580 --> 04:36:54,619
Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow. Uh start at the same time two o'clock pacific

3113
04:36:56,430 --> 04:37:06,060
We'll finish this and if there's time we'll finish the umbrella game. Have a great rest of your evening

3114
04:37:12,419 --> 04:37:24,560
We're not done yet because i'm gonna go like this. Thanks for the subs. Appreciate it everybody. Thank you

3115
04:37:27,860 --> 04:37:38,529
Very much appreciated a little shorter than usual, but you know these days I don't really have a timer

3116
04:37:41,069 --> 04:37:46,529
But I do want each stream to be at least four to five hours. Maybe we go a little long tomorrow

3117
04:37:51,790 --> 04:37:58,740
Any grotto beast thing when grotto beast we will be talking very very deeply about grotto beasts

3118
04:38:00,669 --> 04:38:09,060
I'm hoping very deeply and I mean very deeply about a month from now. You'll be hearing a lot about it. I would say

3119
04:38:12,430 --> 04:38:19,259
Because I really want to make sure that it's possible to get it out for this year's like holiday season

3120
04:38:20,590 --> 04:38:31,819
What we're trying to do see if we hit that target grotto beast tournament prize pool

3121
04:38:40,590 --> 04:38:43,750
Philosophical grotto beast discussion with professor germa

3122
04:38:48,669 --> 04:38:52,750
Wait, what is grotto beast? You don't even need to know until I tell you

3123
04:38:53,389 --> 04:38:58,900
Probably three or four weeks from now

3124
04:39:02,369 --> 04:39:06,319
But I think before that you'll probably hear about a few things

3125
04:39:06,959 --> 04:39:13,659
Especially considering well, you know, why don't we just yeah, you know, maybe tomorrow or the night, you know

3126
04:39:13,740 --> 04:39:17,500
No, no, no, I I don't want to let me talk to people today and tonight and tomorrow

3127
04:39:18,139 --> 04:39:20,139
And make sure I get you some correct information

3128
04:39:21,549 --> 04:39:29,840
So maybe we'll talk about some stuff tomorrow. So now that you said that it's going to be another three months

3129
04:39:34,750 --> 04:39:38,750
Well, I mean technically it might probably is going to be three months before you can see it

3130
04:39:39,549 --> 04:39:41,950
Because that's what I want to have it you be able to get it

3131
04:39:49,819 --> 04:39:53,180
I don't have a release date for it. All I know is I want to be able to have it

3132
04:39:54,040 --> 04:40:02,049
Accessible before the end of december. That's what I want if it's possible. We'll see if not, then it'll come probably shortly after that

3133
04:40:04,220 --> 04:40:05,259
hope

3134
04:40:05,259 --> 04:40:15,069
Oh

3135
04:40:15,069 --> 04:40:16,830
Oh, that's a tip of the hats

3136
04:40:16,830 --> 04:40:18,770
So if you didn't know

3137
04:40:18,770 --> 04:40:22,290
Uh, actually a lot of people that probably are new to the channel don't really know that much about

3138
04:40:23,169 --> 04:40:24,770
me maybe

3139
04:40:24,770 --> 04:40:26,770
more than the last few years

3140
04:40:26,849 --> 04:40:29,650
Uh, but there was the team fortress 2 community

3141
04:40:30,529 --> 04:40:33,569
Did a charity event every year well tip of the hats

3142
04:40:34,369 --> 04:40:35,169
and

3143
04:40:35,169 --> 04:40:37,169
Uh, I would participate in it

3144
04:40:37,490 --> 04:40:39,490
As of probably i'd say like a few years ago

3145
04:40:41,860 --> 04:40:43,860
And I think they're doing their final one

3146
04:40:45,310 --> 04:40:46,110
this

3147
04:40:46,110 --> 04:40:49,860
The next couple of days, I think

3148
04:40:49,860 --> 04:40:51,860
So go, uh, definitely go support them

3149
04:40:52,419 --> 04:40:54,909
All the the old tf2 guys

3150
04:40:55,229 --> 04:40:58,500
I think they've moved on too. I think they're doing like valorant stuff now and

3151
04:40:59,299 --> 04:41:02,000
Um, they're all really really good people. So

3152
04:41:02,880 --> 04:41:04,319
Uh, we're gonna raid them

3153
04:41:04,319 --> 04:41:08,509
But this is the final one go support it go say hello

3154
04:41:09,310 --> 04:41:12,180
And I will see you guys tomorrow

3155
04:41:12,180 --> 04:41:17,700
Well, they're ending right now. All right, hold this for tomorrow. Hold this for tomorrow. It just ended. Oh shit

3156
04:41:18,740 --> 04:41:20,020
shit

3157
04:41:20,020 --> 04:41:23,139
All right, I think they're going tomorrow. They'll be back tomorrow. All right

3158
04:41:23,700 --> 04:41:28,750
We'll get them tomorrow

3159
04:41:28,750 --> 04:41:30,750
Hold hold till tomorrow

3160
04:41:31,069 --> 04:41:33,069
We're going there tomorrow

3161
04:41:33,150 --> 04:41:35,150
bad timing andy

3162
04:41:35,389 --> 04:41:39,069
But honestly like okay, so tomorrow before I go live they're gonna be live before I am

3163
04:41:39,860 --> 04:41:42,500
I'm certain of it probably around like 11 a.m. Um

3164
04:41:43,299 --> 04:41:46,240
I think they're gonna be live tomorrow somewhere around 11 to 12

3165
04:41:48,479 --> 04:41:50,000
Central time maybe

3166
04:41:50,000 --> 04:41:53,279
So they'll be live before I am so go support them before you you know

3167
04:41:53,919 --> 04:41:56,779
Do you want to stay then stay there?

3168
04:41:56,779 --> 04:42:04,500
So now all right, but we'll see if we can catch them tomorrow. Well now I got where we're gonna go

3169
04:42:05,139 --> 04:42:09,810
Who's streaming right now?

3170
04:42:09,810 --> 04:42:36,450
Uh, who's live?

3171
04:42:36,450 --> 04:42:38,610
Oh shit, I just broke my chair

3172
04:42:40,849 --> 04:42:43,169
Hold on. I was like leaning too far

3173
04:42:44,619 --> 04:42:50,669
What the fuck?

3174
04:42:50,669 --> 04:42:54,099
Okay

3175
04:42:54,099 --> 04:42:56,659
Uh, we're gonna let's go say hi to kraken

3176
04:42:57,979 --> 04:43:02,380
I actually I think I actually did break the chair. How did I fucking do this? Do I have to go get another chair?

3177
04:43:03,099 --> 04:43:10,779
I haven't really um

3178
04:43:11,939 --> 04:43:14,880
How do I fuck this up?

3179
04:43:14,880 --> 04:43:16,880
No, we're not delaying tomorrow because of that

3180
04:43:17,680 --> 04:43:19,919
Uh go say hi to kraken if you don't know kraken was

3181
04:43:20,560 --> 04:43:24,639
A huge part of the dollhouse stream. I know you a few weeks ago. We did the um

3182
04:43:25,360 --> 04:43:27,119
behind the scenes show

3183
04:43:27,119 --> 04:43:28,000
but

3184
04:43:28,000 --> 04:43:30,270
Go say hello
