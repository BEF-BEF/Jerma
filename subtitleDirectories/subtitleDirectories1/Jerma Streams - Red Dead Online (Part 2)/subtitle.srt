1
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:31,190
I've returned. Let's see if this'll stay on and if it'll work. Meme incoming. Where's

2
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:38,869
Otto? He's lying down. Downstairs. Just hanging out. I said hello to him. I said hi to him

3
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:46,250
for you guys. As well. Said hey, chat says hi. Wagged his tail a little bit. Gave him

4
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:55,079
a pat. So I just tried to load up into a online just random deathmatch mission to

5
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:25,140
see what happened. Well, if it's having problems for people now, what the hell is gonna happen

6
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,939
when they open it up tomorrow or the next day to potentially 100 to 200 percent more people?

7
00:01:36,790 --> 00:02:01,159
I don't know. Is the GTA 5 launch all over again? Only 25 percent of those people

8
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:09,830
we actually be able to play. Yeah, I don't think, I mean, unless it's a regional thing.

9
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:17,099
Those of you guys that are having problems, what region are you in? If you're seeing the

10
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,759
same disconnect every 10 minutes, every 20 minutes thing, are you West Coast? Or does

11
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:38,060
it, does it even matter? West Elizabeth. All right. Well, I'm in. I'm currently in

12
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:57,259
and there are players here, right? There are. There are players. So this is, if the hat fits,

13
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:06,020
it's right here. Let's see if I can get it to work. Let's see if I can play a mission.

14
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:22,460
Just send me a shitty horse. That's fine. Never do it for free. Level eight stamina.

15
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:32,300
What's the highest stamina you can have? Go fast, go fast, go fast. The faster I've gone,

16
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:45,319
the actually the more I've been able to connect. Hyenas, watch out. This, yes,

17
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:51,240
this is online. We are now in online. How long we will be here is the real question.

18
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:15,930
Howdy. Start matchmaking. Get us in the game. If this horse goes under 45 miles per hour,

19
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:28,920
we're all dead. When do you get the ability to sell pelts? Look at that character.

20
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:41,350
Okay, game details. Oh, horribly directed towards the Blackwater police chief in

21
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,110
Pike's Basin. Con man and outlaws on the loose. Where the justice is done will depend

22
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:52,819
on your honor. Let's go. So we, we're gonna try to take this guy alive as a crew here.

23
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:01,879
You're an ambassador. A what? An idiot. I'm sorry. He said he wouldn't run away. Shut up.

24
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:08,139
But please. But just shut up. I don't think you can. They're gonna fire me.

25
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,860
Oh, you, you get to keep your job, but they'll fire me and they've got every right to fire me

26
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:22,300
because I'm the idiot who employed you. Oh, look, guests. Skip 103.

27
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:33,500
You can't be any worse than us because this idiot, this idiot right here, just let the

28
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,220
most notorious con man in the whole goddamn state walk clean out of a cell, clean out

29
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:49,189
and not a shot fired. Now you get him back for us. We'll happily pay you.

30
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,029
Are you with the same players earlier? I don't think so. How about that? That'd be very odd.

31
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:02,470
Good, good. Now see what I figure is I figure he's headed on down to Pike's Basin.

32
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,149
So you go down the canyon and you get it almost over and I'm gonna beat this poor dumb

33
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:13,430
bastard with a stick. I just didn't skip into the very beginning, but

34
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,790
if you're gonna sit through the movie, you're gonna get up right before the big reveal happens.

35
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:31,670
All right, go to camp. Oh, I took, we're taking all the wrong horses.

36
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:46,230
Nice musical chairs. All right, we're good. We get two lives. Track this guy down.

37
00:06:46,470 --> 00:07:09,180
Watch it. Easy, easy. The gang is protecting the outlaw. Take them out. Sorry, sorry. Explosion.

38
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:44,540
Watch this. Ready? I'm the cool one. Okay, a couple more left. Okay. Have I been shooting

39
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:59,420
the rock the whole time? Someone's coming up. Hold them there. Just shoot the fucking rock.

40
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:21,610
I'm gonna get low score. No, I'm not. Go get the outlaw. No, don't stop. Don't, no.

41
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:32,809
Lose all of our lives. Okay. Well, it's gonna, we'll leave this up to you.

42
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,000
You just go get the outlaw. What are you doing? Where's the outlaw?

43
00:08:51,210 --> 00:09:01,450
Okay, we're so stupid. This is not how this is supposed to be done.

44
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:22,500
Hog tie the outlaw. How are we gonna get him back up? Anybody have a horse?

45
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:44,340
Okay, let's go. Deliver the outlaw in one piece. What just happened? Oh no. Oh, this is not good.

46
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,299
All right, you guys gotta protect me. Protect me. Protect me. I'm the guy with the outlaw on my

47
00:09:49,299 --> 00:10:10,309
back. We can't die. Dying is bad. Up there. On the cliff too. I think we have to just,

48
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:25,100
we have to get out of here. We have to leave. That's it, right? No, I need a horse.

49
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,419
All right, I'll take care of the outlaw. You guys just keep me,

50
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:45,480
you're on my horse. That's my horse. I love this how all over the place this happens every time.

51
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:52,600
All right, let's go. Just have to deliver him and he's gonna be alive. We're gonna get a good

52
00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:09,850
bounty for it. Just watch. Yep, I knew it was gonna happen. What just happened? You can't

53
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:29,779
whistle for your horse right now. Guy to your left. Horse, get over here. Oh no, no, no,

54
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:57,080
he's gonna die. Get him up. Revive him before we lose. Okay, there we go. Epic teamwork.

55
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:16,730
Are we good? Good guy, Jerma. Oh, what you mean to say is team lives one. More explosions.

56
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:37,019
Explosions. Now, this mission's been fun. This is a cool one. I can totally see me doing

57
00:12:37,019 --> 00:13:00,919
with, with like star, you know what I mean? Italic, Vinny. Yeah, once this is more stable,

58
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,840
this would be fun to have like three or four people. I would definitely do this again.

59
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:14,970
Instead of being like a QA tester, I'd like to get into it. Who are the current teammates?

60
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:40,009
Uh, yeah, just a couple of other YouTubers. You know, I gotta hit the explosion. See off

61
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:58,279
the gang. See off. That's it. All right, we need a horse. Drop the outlaw by the camp.

62
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:13,399
Why are we doing it like this? Let me go. Let me go. I've got money. I've got a lot of money

63
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,529
and I'll pay. I'll pay a lot. Hey, here's an idea. Take my hat. Put it on the dead guy

64
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:26,179
over there. You take him in as me. I go free and you get rich. Oh, and I won't kill

65
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:33,139
anybody else. I swear I'm reformed. I'm a changed man. I'm reformed. I'm better. Please,

66
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,940
please. I'm begging you. Set me free. Have a heart. Do we have to vote on this?

67
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:49,909
Refuse offer. Oh my god. Take offer or let the timer expire. Refu- I got it. I got majority.

68
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:14,409
I got majority. I really would like his hat. Sean's back. It's a pretty ugly hat

69
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:26,659
anyways. It kind of, yeah, it is. It is a really ugly hat, but is the material it's made out of

70
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:47,899
expensive? It could very well be. I probably shouldn't do that again. Don't stop in front

71
00:15:47,899 --> 00:16:09,830
of me. Did she just fall off? Grandma got DC'd.

72
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:51,830
Excuse me. Feed the ho- yeah, this guy does look really good. It is a gorgeous guy. Cried

73
00:16:51,830 --> 00:17:16,859
into a rock. Not after how long that took. Take him in. I could have just jumped to horse.

74
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,339
So you got him? Seven dollars. Real good. Look. Put him up on my horse there. I didn't do nothing.

75
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:29,259
There's the money I promised you. It's nice seeing you again, buddy. Seven dollars. That's enough for me to

76
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,900
take a ride to Blackwater. Just name your price and I'll make you rich.

77
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,299
See you later. I made the money back that I wasted on the horse, yeah? I did.

78
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:55,450
Free hat? No, we didn't get the hat. You get the hat if you let him live.

79
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:09,980
No, you don't turn him in. Hey, I got to play Red Dead Online for 30 minutes.

80
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:33,240
And we're still here? Yeah, don't jinx it. We'll see. No, we're still here.

81
00:18:38,700 --> 00:19:10,019
Alright. What was that? Snake? Whoa, that's a perfect rattlesnake. How do I

82
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:48,970
not destroy the meat here? Once was good. I was scared. It costs money to just be alive in this

83
00:19:48,970 --> 00:20:34,170
game. Does this person hide in the cactuses? Don't remind me. Just existing. Can I interact

84
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:49,130
with them? I just disconnected him. Oh no, I just made that guy DC.

85
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,299
Right now he's probably sitting in his room. What the fuck? I just DC'd again.

86
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:24,630
Why? What happened? God damn it. He's back. No, it's not. It's a different guy. How long do

87
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:37,140
they stay like this for? Hold on. This guy is just... I just have this guy. I fucking DC'd him

88
00:21:37,140 --> 00:22:02,980
too. Oh, just the fucking serial disconnector. There's somebody else over here now. There he is.

89
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:33,859
What? Hold on a second. Why could I not hogtie him? I died instantly.

90
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:45,210
He wasn't even looking. He just swung in a circle and hit me right in the head and hit me in the

91
00:22:45,210 --> 00:23:01,579
temple. So what's over here? Where are they? I think they got DC'd. He used all the power of

92
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:25,819
his internet to hit me and then disconnected. So what am I chasing over here? There they are.

93
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:41,420
Oh no, that's very far away. No, that person's not even here. See? Let's head to town. Let's

94
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:49,220
try to make some friends. I want to lasso somebody in the bar and then throw them over

95
00:23:49,220 --> 00:24:10,650
the balcony and then run away. Making new death train. Make friends in a rock star game. Good

96
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,289
luck. Yo, that's what I mean. Another few days or so. I feel like maybe like a week

97
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:27,579
and they get all the bugs ironed out. Come in with like a group of like three or four people

98
00:24:27,579 --> 00:25:00,059
and just have some fun. I think that's gonna be the plan. What the hell was that? What? Why

99
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:14,660
did I let it come? Was I just not close enough? Oh, they can break free. So you gotta be real

100
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:49,579
close to even attempt it. Come here! It takes so long to get over to them. Press the melee

101
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:52,380
button? Well, I have to be close enough to do it.

102
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:44,230
Come here! I'm gonna get you with this. Oh! Can't break out of that. This is so odd. Wait, what?

103
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,940
Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!

104
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
Oh, the disconnect.

105
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:56,740
I just ran into a stop sign. Imagine being on his end and watching that. Oh, I would be dead.

106
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:03,130
I would kill me. I would be dead. You'd have to resurrect me.

107
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:38,339
It reminds me of once when I kicked sand at somebody in elementary school

108
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,140
and turned to run and smacked into a pole.

109
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:52,250
I love that shit. It's so stupid. So okay, so you can break out if you're actually hogtied

110
00:28:52,250 --> 00:29:06,970
and stowed. So what's the point of being hogtied and stowed if it lasts like 10 seconds? I would

111
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:21,769
love if that lasted like at least five minutes. I would so I would love to be hogtied and just

112
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:28,519
brought around and just... Yeah, I hear you. It'd be so funny.

113
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:40,119
All right, a rival gang is doing something. Imagine just being part of somebody else's

114
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:50,180
video game where you're just an NPC but you're not. I'm just having a conversation,

115
00:29:50,180 --> 00:30:02,869
just hanging out. I'm just like, okay, I'm still here. All right, which one of these

116
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:07,509
rival gangs? Apparently, this is the rival gang I'm about to stop. I have to stop this

117
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:22,680
person here. Who? Who needs to be stopped? I don't see anybody. Maybe I wasn't fast enough.

118
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:43,750
Let's see if I can do it this time. No missions right now. Really? Because

119
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:54,700
you got nothing to do? You have nothing going on? Doesn't have any missions. Okay.

120
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:11,819
I guess that is a response. Yeah. So who we got? I can do another one of those story

121
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:21,240
missions. There seems to be a lot of people down here. Somebody right behind me.

122
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:34,650
Somebody overlooking the view down there. What does that marker mean? Index. What does it mean?

123
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:45,819
I don't understand what that means. Well, I'm gonna take the stagecoach to Saint Denis.

124
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,740
There's a lot of people down there. Let me spend all of my money to do that.

125
00:31:52,299 --> 00:32:11,579
It's only three bucks. Never mind. We're good. There's a free revolver?

126
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:25,849
Well, I'll get it. I'll get it later. Can you rob people? I don't think you can just rob another

127
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:33,880
player. Unless it's a specific mission where you're trying to stop them. All right, here we

128
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:44,309
are. Saint Denis. Somebody this way. Somebody that way. This person's trying to go do this

129
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:53,859
mission, I think. So let's see if I can... No, maybe not. You got a mission?

130
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:10,279
All right, so I'm gonna be the target here.

131
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:20,420
Pick up the mail bag. Deliver the mail to a series of recipients within the time limit

132
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:31,299
to earn the full reward. Where's the mail? Where's the mail bag? Mail bag? Where's the mail bag?

133
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:49,900
I'm stuck in here now. I locked myself in with this fucking guy. What? How is that even possible?

134
00:33:50,619 --> 00:34:08,199
The door is locked. Oh, I can't pick up the mail bag because I can't get out of the mail room.

135
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:32,940
I can't do it. I'm stuck here forever. Somebody help me. Somebody come help me.

136
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:52,260
How do I get someone to know that I'm in here? It makes me put it away immediately.

137
00:34:52,340 --> 00:35:10,940
How do you whistle? Whistle? What's a whistle? What's a whistle? I can't punch him.

138
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:17,139
How do I whistle? I'm gonna... How do I invite everybody?

139
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:35,659
Somebody let the bird out. Respawn. I feel like I want to be in here though.

140
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:40,539
I feel like somebody could... This is gonna be fun. How do I invite people to my location?

141
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:58,230
Invites. Okay, this person here. Where's the nearest person? This person getting their

142
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:09,320
haircut right here. Damn it. How do I report myself? I can't. I'm stuck. Whatever.

143
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,440
Would have been kind of fun to be in here and be the guy that is locked in here.

144
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:51,219
How do I just respawn myself? Do I just go in and out? I'm just an NPC now. Quick join.

145
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:56,329
Just quick join again. Just wait out the 10 minutes and see what happens.

146
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,610
That's not a bad idea. That really isn't a bad idea.

147
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:19,480
Oh, I figured out what to do. Somebody help me. I'm stuck in here. Help me. Help.

148
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:25,719
Somebody just drove by. Somebody stop. I'm stuck in here. Somebody help me.

149
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:44,920
Help me. Help. Get in here and do something. Please. Help me. Open the door. See I...

150
00:37:45,719 --> 00:38:03,480
I can't get out of here. See? Look. I tried everything. Help. Go get it. Go get some friend.

151
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:15,670
Go get some dynamite. Do anything. Blow this up. Help. No, don't go do a mission. Help me.

152
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:33,079
I'm in here. I tried the same thing. It doesn't work. There's a spot where I can shoot right

153
00:38:33,079 --> 00:39:00,889
here. Got it. Where is it? Right here? Right there. This guy doesn't even care that I'm

154
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:05,449
just smashing the place up. Have them shoot through the window. Maybe they can shoot me

155
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:21,739
through the window. I got to get in the right place though. Time's counting down. I want to

156
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:30,969
see what happens. Okay. It needs to be perfect in the right position. No. A little bit more

157
00:39:30,969 --> 00:40:01,719
to the right and right there. I was really hoping that I could shoot somebody from out

158
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:08,019
of there. If I knew that I could aim out the window like that and that guy stood there,

159
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:13,139
just put it between his eyes. And then his cause. Have him get angry to the point where

160
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:22,199
he needs to figure out a way to get him to get to me. At that point, he's going to throw a

161
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:46,340
dynamite into the window. Are Avans paying attention to what the players are doing? No.

162
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:54,679
It's just a problem with, for some reason. I don't know what it is with my west coast

163
00:40:54,679 --> 00:41:01,480
connection to the Rockstar servers, but they don't want me on here. Rockstar's servers

164
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:10,539
for me just keep dropping. It's not my internet. My internet's fine. It's somehow

165
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:15,260
wherever I'm going doesn't like me there. Kill all the players to rise up the leaderboard the

166
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:26,500
higher you get, the more points you're worth. See if I can just play it. Rockstar, I hate your rat videos.

167
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:51,030
Well, I got to hear the... I got to at least hear it. Well, we're going on about six hours

168
00:41:51,030 --> 00:42:05,610
here. It might be time to throw the towel in after like another couple attempts. Don't you

169
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:12,840
fucking... Well, the end of the stream voice. How good does it feel to say it's not my internet?

170
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:27,619
It actually feels pretty great. Do I have an opinion on online yet? No, I don't. I really don't.

171
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:39,639
It looks very fun. And from the random snippets of time that I get to be in it,

172
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:58,659
oh, it's great. It seems very cool once it's actually stable. He's doing the concerned

173
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:03,449
professional voice. Well, you know, you can give my opinion on the video game.

174
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,929
I'm going to sound at least somewhat professional so when somebody links this

175
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:23,900
to rockstar.com. All right, where are we right now? Is somebody over here?

176
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:40,730
Okay, I'm going to just go visit that person or try to do this mission. Hopefully I don't

177
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:50,739
get locked into the room, whatever the hell it is. I went around every inch of your

178
00:43:50,739 --> 00:44:15,300
house except the one place to go in. Don't go inside, I'm gonna get trapped in here.

179
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,139
Why am I made out of plastic? My character is made out of plastic.

180
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,820
Android person.

181
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:42,539
I had them. I went away for a couple of days on a killing of a bastard.

182
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:46,539
Melting wax figurine.

183
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:56,860
I'll find them again. I've lost them before. You know, once was for three months it was.

184
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:03,340
That's how it goes, I guess. Anyway, where was it? Oh, yeah, yeah. Murder and mayhem.

185
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:10,090
Now to kill innocent folk myself gives me a real nasty feeling inside, but these bastards.

186
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,369
Where does this take place during the story? These bastards are. There's a stage. I'm actually

187
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:21,530
not sure. I heard a fella say it's laden with silver. I can't rob it. I can't guarantee

188
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:26,809
someone else hasn't gone before, but it'd be a rotten shame to let it pass, boy. Anyways,

189
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:42,019
armatures. All right, matchmaking time. Ambush and rob the stagecoach. Not matchmaking.

190
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:54,980
Stop the stagecoach and steal the loot bag within the time limit. I'm assuming there's

191
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:06,940
other people that are also doing this or trying to stop me from doing this. That would

192
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:20,119
be interesting. How far away is it? No, it's right there. That's convenient. Right in front

193
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:44,969
of me. Driver. Yeah, I'll try. There's so many people in there. There's a lot of people in here.

194
00:46:45,849 --> 00:47:04,199
Full party in this wagon. Okay, target the passengers and take the loot. What?

195
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:19,480
They're going anywhere. Give me that loot bag. All right, get out of here.

196
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:38,340
Bag. All right, deliver the loot bag. Get out of the road. I can't stop. Get out of the road. I

197
00:47:38,340 --> 00:48:04,539
can't stop. Rival players can steal the loot bag. They won't be doing that. That's damn, damn sure

198
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:22,780
about that. Well, he's dead. No, I'm too far away. I'm kind of in the middle of fucking nowhere.

199
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:37,159
Can you eat the bag? I don't think you can eat it. The horse is getting too tired.

200
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:48,599
Yeah, if I get disconnected here before turning this in, then I think that's a

201
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:53,059
throw the towel up in the air situation. That's what I think.

202
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:10,010
I got a bag and it's full of loot. Stuck in the loot bag. So what do I get for doing that?

203
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:19,780
One cent and two dollars. And you're telling me people can fight over that bag?

204
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:51,320
Why would you fight over that bag? This is my horse? Yeah, I can do a two bird.

205
00:49:56,409 --> 00:50:02,489
Okay, let me go into the city center. Well, that would have been cool if somebody tried

206
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:15,559
to stop me. I think we're here alone. I don't think there's anybody in this session. God damn

207
00:50:15,559 --> 00:51:02,820
it. That's why. Well, whoops. I think that's gonna be it. I think it's time to throw the

208
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:12,889
towel in. It's just not ready yet. At least for me to play it. Maybe you can stay connected

209
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:16,730
if you're from a part of the world or the country where you're able to stay connected.

210
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:23,219
A rock star does not want me to be connected to their game for some reason. I don't know why.

211
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:48,309
Sure is beautiful out here. I haven't dced all day. Yeah, I think it's just depending on what

212
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:53,349
region you're connecting to or where you're connecting from. King of the castle. All right,

213
00:51:53,989 --> 00:52:16,980
a free roam event. Yes, I'll do it. Take me there. That's how I feel right now. Well,

214
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:32,199
thanks for coming to the stream. That's Red Dead Redemption 2 Online. You've been disconnected

215
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:46,809
from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar game services. Red Dead Offline. Yeah. Well,

216
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:52,409
it wasn't a total loss because there was some stuff to see there and hopefully over the next

217
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:59,989
day or two the service is brought up to the task of a higher standard to be able to be

218
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:06,599
allowed to connect to it. Stay connected to it. But that's going to be the end of the stream.

219
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:14,860
So again, let me make this very clear. Tomorrow night is the last day and night for you to do

220
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:21,510
a green screen submission from the green screen stream a couple weeks ago. If you want to put

221
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,469
something in, it's got to be at least 10 seconds. Can't be more than two minutes.

222
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,829
There are rules to read that are pinned in that Discord's channel.

223
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:35,670
Got to be a YouTube link because it's going to be going on a giant playlist

224
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:43,260
and that deadline is tomorrow. Tomorrow night. Submissions will not be considered

225
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:51,349
if they come in after tomorrow night. And with that, I will see you guys on Friday.

226
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:59,539
Friday, we're going to do Jackbox, which will lead us into Sunday, which will be the

227
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:08,019
green screen movie night. This should be the thumbnail and I may even stream on Saturday

228
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:13,860
as well. We might go Friday, Saturday, Sunday, depending on what's available because if Red Dead

229
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:19,860
works by Saturday, then maybe we'll do a thing where it's Friday is Jackbox, Saturday is

230
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:24,980
Red Dead Online. Maybe get a few friends, get a few people to join into a squad

231
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:32,460
and then Sunday will be movie night. So we'll give it a try. Do I have a schedule yet? I

232
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:38,070
don't. I don't. And I know it's been about three or four straight weeks here of streaming

233
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:49,110
in Vegas on Pacific time. And I'm like, yeah, I got a schedule. I don't know. Maybe I just won't.

234
00:54:53,239 --> 00:55:01,340
Maybe I'll just stream because I look, here's the long and short of that. I've been streaming

235
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:07,639
more often since being here, right? Let me put the outro on so people don't think I'm

236
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:17,210
sticking around. I've been streaming more often. So I think that having the opportunity

237
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:25,050
to just kind of plan each week, because then it's like, oh, okay, so here's what's

238
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,530
gonna happen. I'm gonna do this on Monday, Tuesday, and then like Thursday, Friday.

239
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:34,550
Maybe I'll just stay with it for a while. I think the start time will always be the same.

240
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:42,630
It'll always be somewhere around 3 p.m. Pacific, between like 2 to 3 p.m., 3-ish p.m. Pacific.

241
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:53,659
But I'm not sure. I think when I have a schedule, I've talked about schedules before

242
00:55:53,659 --> 00:56:00,500
and it's great and it helps, but I feel like I've been streaming more often because

243
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:06,179
when I have a schedule, oh, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, that's it. That's when I stream.

244
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:11,849
Just Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. That's when I'm live. I'm not live. I don't do anything else.

245
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:14,329
Having no schedule allows me to kind of just do what I want and sometimes that

246
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:20,199
even means streaming four or five days a week. I don't know. I haven't come to

247
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:23,320
a conclusion yet, but for now I'm still going to be schedule-less for now.

248
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,949
But let's do the bits. Thanks for sticking around. I'll see you hopefully on

249
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:40,739
Friday for Jackbox 5 and then hope to see you again this weekend.

250
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:48,360
I'm going to take the offline screen down, but I got to change it before I do that because

251
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,099
I don't want it to just be like a default thing. I got to have that ready. It's going

252
00:56:52,099 --> 00:57:02,010
to go and just edit it. But let's start back six plus hours ago here. Shrapnel or Shcrapnel,

253
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:08,230
thanks for the $1. Thanks also to Mostly Lost for the $1. Jerma, if all you did for the

254
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:12,630
rest of your career was just stream character creation sequences, I'd be perfectly happy.

255
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:21,159
I do love creating characters. It is a lot of fun. It is one of my favorite things,

256
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:30,469
but thank you. Thank you to Divus P for the three bucks coming in with a three spot.

257
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:38,889
Seems like Divus comes in every single stream with $3. Thank you for the $3. Thank you for

258
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:43,610
consistent $3 pretty much every stream and more than that. You've given way more than

259
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:55,179
that on some streams. Thank you. That's my go-to number. Thanks. Extra Cheesy, thanks

260
00:57:55,179 --> 00:58:05,900
for the $1. Congrats. You made a Neanderthal cowboy. No, it's the Muppet from the taxicab,

261
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:13,300
but thanks a lot. Extra Cheesy for the $1. Lightning Rider had five community subs.

262
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:24,539
Thank you Lightning Rider. Lots of subscriptions and congratulations to the people that got those

263
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:33,179
subscriptions. Yen Wen, thank you Yen Wen. Yen Wenlin for the $1. I've been enjoying your red

264
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:37,820
dead streams, especially the two and a half hour death train bit you did. I decided to

265
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:43,260
draw a picture of you and Francis the Fox. You technically owe me like $200 now, but I'll

266
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:48,920
let it slide. Wait, what? This image is for you only. You can show chat, but please don't

267
00:58:48,920 --> 00:59:06,280
share the link. Okay, this is for me only. The death train was a lot of fun. This image

268
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:27,239
is for you only. Private image. I'm going to screen cap it. He said you can show chat.

269
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:40,570
Here. No, that's, oh my God. That is, that is so detailed. All right. I'm going to have to,

270
00:59:40,570 --> 01:00:01,219
I have to show this on stream. That's absolutely amazing. Let me pull it out here.

271
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:18,340
You got to look at this shit guys. Oh my God. I feel like I need to hang this in my

272
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:52,300
living room. That has to go over a mantle. Wow. Nice fucking job hanging in the living room.

273
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,019
I'm going to like just have a, I'm going to have a copy of that. It's going to be sitting

274
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:08,920
right here on my desk. But thank you. That's Yen Wen Lin. Yen Wen Lin for your incredibly

275
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:16,699
amazing piece of artwork. Thank you. That's for me only. That's for me only though.

276
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:30,820
Nobody else. Right onto the fridge. In every room. Hey, Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar.

277
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:46,230
Just keep it up. Yeah, let's go. I'm just going to keep it like over here. It's my new wallpaper.

278
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:50,949
Thank you, Dr. Clay for the one dollar. The guy who helped you with the muppet taxi thing

279
01:01:50,949 --> 01:02:07,400
was Dragon Breath. Here's proof. We got time stamp. We got proof. Thank you. Thank

280
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:14,010
you for the help. Oh, that's me. Thank you, Dr. Clay. Thank you extra cheesy for the one

281
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:23,079
dollar. I don't need to understand. I just need to do. Jerma the Philosopher 2018. That's

282
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:28,300
accurate. Thank you extra cheesy again for the one dollar. You should make another character

283
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:36,460
that looks like a hipster and roleplay him as a time traveler. Why would I do that? Thank you

284
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:43,699
to Mulu Mulum for the one dollar. I love you, Jerma boy. You're the best fluffy Garfield

285
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:52,699
kitty. Thanks for the one dollar Mulum or Mullium. Renegade Panther. Thanks for the 15 dollars.

286
01:02:53,179 --> 01:03:08,260
15 bucks from Renegade Panther. They say hey hey Jerma. 69. That's it. Thanks for the 15 dollars

287
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:21,780
Renegade. Appreciate it. 15 bucks. Got him. Hey WildFox. Thanks for the one dollar WildFox 73.

288
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,869
WildFox 173. Jerma currently watching my way through the VODs again and I'm super thankful

289
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:30,710
for your regular streaming. Since I can't work in winter as a landscaper, I have tons of

290
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:35,670
free time. I've been playing Fallout straight for longer than is probably good for me. What

291
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:41,460
are some good games you got obsessed with and fell in love with? There are a couple of very obvious

292
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:50,469
answers here. There's Diablo 2 is one of my favorite games. I have thousands of hours in

293
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:57,239
that game. Binding of Isaac is another one. If you just want to just fall into a video game

294
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:01,239
and just keep doing run after run and it's just something you always play, Binding of Isaac

295
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:07,420
is probably the best one I would say in this current kind of generation. I'd also tell you

296
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:15,219
to play Team Fortress 2. Maybe if you asked this two or three years ago, maybe I'd say that.

297
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:21,059
I just don't know what the state of the game is really at all. But if you've never played TF2

298
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:34,170
before, it's kind of just opening up an entire world of fun shit to do. Diablo 2,

299
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:45,579
he's a boomer. Diablo 2 is so good. It is so much fun. It's just the best, but it's just
