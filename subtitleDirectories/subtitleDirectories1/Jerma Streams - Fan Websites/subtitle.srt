8
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,049
Hello, yes hi everybody.

9
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:12,890
Today is going to be a very short stream. It will be very quick and to the point, well not even really to the point.

10
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:19,840
We've got some things to do today, a couple of very interesting things that I find incredibly interesting.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:28,459
Are there a couple of websites that I came across I have to do with this community and I really really want to do them

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,120
Because one of them is very relevant to like a week ago, and the other one is just cool

13
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:43,049
So this is not the final stream. No no no now. This is the this is it. This is the last one

14
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,650
Hold on these like cat ears are so itchy God

15
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,230
I'm just getting this no fucking cat ears

16
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:00,780
You see they look at the chat the chat just went insane the chat just went boom

17
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:09,360
No, I do not have a catboy costume on right now. You say the words catboy and all of a sudden

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,849
Oh my god here come the floodgates of chat messages prove it. I'm gonna prove it. I'm gonna put the camera on

19
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,509
The first thing we're gonna do

20
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,189
So this this stream is gonna be probably like an hour maybe tops

21
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,069
It depends on how long it takes me to do the greatest video games of all time tier list

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:41,050
That could take like four hours. I don't know that's fine

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,849
But we'll see one hour Andy

24
00:02:50,169 --> 00:03:03,240
No, there's no catboy today. We're just gonna hang out is everything okay? Everything is fine

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,680

26
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,110

29
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:34,319

33
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,000

34
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,919
Don't I don't I kind of look like I don't fit in here

35
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,740
I feel like I'm wearing like a sleeping bag or something like oh, I'm here for the sleepover

36
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:21,379
Just put a just put a pillow behind me, okay

37
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:28,279
Is it extra small take it off and reveal the cat where no this is not a scenario

38
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,920
We're like all the reason why he looks like he's got a bunch of clothes on he's gonna unzip this is gonna be a full

39
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:47,720

I was about to just shout it out, and that was a fucking huge mistake potentially okay

Thousands and thousands of messages and it is for me to determine if this is something that was actually written in the chat or

152
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,230
the AI

153
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,830
Robot came up with this learning what you guys have said over the years

154
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:37,629
Let's find out so we have to see how many of these we can get in a row. Oh what?

155
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:49,980
What kind of a name is that that seems pretty AI generated, but I feel like that could be real real that's incorrect

156
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:56,639
Try again zero streak. I don't think this is how it works. That's AI. Yeah, come on

157
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:06,740
This is like that one episode of spongebob where he's trying to get the seal. That's real. What only one

158
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,670
All right. Well, you get it. You get outwards too bad

159
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:16,319
None of it's going to be in the actual game real you got a misspelling their robots. Don't misspell

160
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,569
They're fucking intelligent without to say that they're not intelligent, right?

161
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:27,490
I'm going to rent out the level-up lounge in the MGM casino to host my own convention. What the fuck is that?

162
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:41,900
German on 8 5 2009. That's AI generated. I didn't do that. This game is so fucking hard to watch. That's real

163
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:48,559
This is the last time you can play this game. I think that's probably real

164
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,930
What the shortness of his arm Sleever is making me uncomfortable?

165
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,579
Sleever

166
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:14,990
That's AI he's actually not going to say it AI what you're not a clown you're the entire

167
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:25,859
Circus imagine having a girlfriend when you have twitch chat. I feel like that's AI

168
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:33,069
We're talking about how we can seduce you. That's real

169
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:40,680
This is like yeah, you guys have gotten do you you're like fucking lewd levels have gone up like six hundred thousand percent in the last

170
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:51,569
Year, I don't think Jerma has the actual setup that sounds AI it is

171
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:56,220
Lemur's suicide tower for when they realize their enclosure sucks

172
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:08,329
Jerma the only way to win is to I thought I thought that could have been AI Jerma

173
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:12,759
The only way to win is to not play that's AI. We're four in a row here

174
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:18,519
I gotta get to at least ten in a row Jerma. I've been watching your videos for like two years

175
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:26,009
Please just stop. I think this one could be AI

176
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:30,230
But I think it's real because people like tell me to stop streaming and like stop doing YouTube and stuff

177
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,029
all the time

178
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:39,259
Again, let's do it again

179
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:44,759
You're gonna get addicted to the game. You're gonna get addicted to the game in like 30 minutes real

180
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,009
Hey, I know it's not that big of a deal, but I have to admit

181
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm really bummed that you're not playing this right now. That's AI has to be that's a jumbled AI

182
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,640
That has to be a if it's real. I don't know what they're even talking about. Okay

183
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,140
Hey star, can I go to your house and talk to Lucy? This is fucking AI

184
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:20,180
What's the context behind that one? Hey star gonna go to your house and talk to Lucy. It ain't the size of the screw

185
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,900
It's how hard you drill that's real. I think I wrote that if you don't use the I'm the giant rat voice

186
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:44,079
You're not a hero that seemed pretty real. Are you going to do the cooking stream real? Oh my god

187
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,059
You know the guy from the hit movie the Phantom Pain

188
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:52,799
I feel like the ones that are very obviously AI end up being real

189
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:04,609
Wait, that's you're doing a great job. Thanks for the stream. I know I know that's AI. I know that's AI

190
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:12,829
Motherfuckers don't write that here. How many people I'm just kidding you do but how many people die when they get a jet pack?

191
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:22,339
But how many people die when they get a jet pack? I think that's real. It has the at German 985 on it

192
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:29,950
What did it say? What did it say? It's a jackpot. I said I wasn't me

193
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,509
I almost pressed AI because I said jet pack

194
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:39,150
Did he fight giraffe seems like I missed a section of stream and I don't know if he's optional

195
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:52,500
The thing is like people give weird random easy names to the like the Dark Souls bosses

196
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,849
I'm trying to think. Oh, did you get the dancer yet? But that's like short for something

197
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:07,930
It's what giraffe you get to did you get to get a banana yet? Did you get to schnaz yet?

198
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:17,119
People say that kind of shit. It's got it. Oh god at German 95. You just woke me the fuck up. That's real

199
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:28,950
Are you gonna play the DS sequel after this? I don't I don't buy this one. Am I gonna play the DS sequel?

200
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:44,759
Oh chibi-robo, that's right. We're five in a row. You're most going to be in a clown car. It's

201
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:56,150
What however, none of you actually said that what are you talking about? No one's actually wrote writ that before

202
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:05,309
I love German stream, but not the chat real it's a game about what I'm just saying like I don't believe that

203
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:10,630
I don't believe that I'm just saying that's probably real. It's a game about collecting and selling coins AI

204
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,829
Can you tell me what the fuck is happening real?

205
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:25,000
Whatever the joke is that the bands don't happen plumbers don't wear ties robots don't use guns. That's AI

206
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:50,140
Well, I I'm sorry AI but I have never streamed the movie Zoolander and if I was streaming Zoolander on twitch

207
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,750
I don't think you'd be asleep. You'd be waiting for me to get terminated to laugh us

208
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:11,319
Right omega lol when you see like that that stream has been banned somebody wrote that okay

209
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:19,450
I guess somebody wrote that I have no idea what that is, but I'm glad it's not a meme real

210
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:27,380
I don't know. You can see the pain in his face real what you guys are really fucking annoying. You're all invited

211
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:40,690
Hey, can you play cave story? Ost that gets asked all the time. You need to buy the boots to beat this real

212
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:51,829
Oh my fucking god, this is like a person and they're here right now that person here

213
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,940
Please talk more about sensitive topic in the chat. We love it. That this is the person's price

214
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,940
That's AI. You have to tell me something is wrong AI

215
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:09,140
You have to do the full three minutes slow mode real fuck. It's getting I don't know

216
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:16,480
I can't tell the difference you can buy a few of these at the market AI another person

217
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:28,980
We're being gaslighted by the height police echo the dolphin. Oh my god, Jeremy

218
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:39,500
Please real how he played the game with the discount with the like it's AI. What do you think?

219
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:54,809
I don't know you think it's is it AI real. It's real. I'm gonna say it. This game is trash

220
00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:09,849
I feel like people say that every stream, but it's very specific AI. This is a good game

221
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:20,380
You just need to be really good at it. That smells very robust smells like AI to me. Yep

222
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,440
All right, we're at six. Are you gonna play the other games too? I mean, this is a simple question

223
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:38,299
I think I think so. Are you gonna play the other games too? They're all AI all of them are gonna be AI real

224
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:45,980
Oh, I could tell. All right. I gotta get to ten. That's what that's what made me get fired my job AI

225
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:54,380
Why are you playing this game again AI? It seems like you somehow downgraded your audio solution real

226
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,220
I see I get I get shit for that all the time

227
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:01,869
If I remember right Jerma actually read the message, which is why I got in trouble

228
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:10,940
I don't know what it was, but you got in fucking trouble

229
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:18,769
This is so weird Jerma is the first person who actually uses the stealth mechanics in this game

230
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,819
That's a fucking that's an AI. I have never ever

231
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,029
truly used

232
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:31,460
Stealth mechanics in a stealth video game. I get shit for it all the time. I can't do it. I'm horrible

233
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:40,980
This is this is AI. What was it from Metro 2033? How the how do you remember that?

234
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:48,980
How do you possibly remember that? This is my first Jerma stream and I'm enthralled AI whatever

235
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,559
He never actually moved to Vegas. It's all been soundbites real

236
00:27:52,559 --> 00:28:01,430
You can use the item menu to find what you want AI. It's got the Dark Souls filter and saturation

237
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:16,809
It was so they were dry. So it was just like sunflower seeds. Yeah AI god damn it

238
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:25,059
ASMR Jerma quizzes you on an app you barely use real streamer change sus

239
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:32,380
So he won't be late real what if you did it in the wrong order AI, that's too many kids

240
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:49,099
They'll go back to their parents. Oh, I don't know real this feels a this feels very AI. God damn it

241
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:56,660
I should have went with I got hour and a half to finally get to gameplay real. Oh my god

242
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,740
He's still in paperclip Londo. I know it's stream. That's from it's real

243
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:16,079
You should have taken someone with better lockpicking. This could be fake old man gives himself blood pressure

244
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:32,720
Live on stream give myself blood pressure. What old man gives himself blood pressure on stream

245
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:39,940
You know what they say about a man with a big-ass dick

246
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:52,859
Not real. I don't know. What do they say guy in Jerma chat that why would you write that?

247
00:29:52,859 --> 00:30:02,950
I just got here and you're still on this level. What the fuck? It's too good. Check out this clip

248
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,779
Problem with this generation is nobody's reading books anymore

249
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,380
You know saying like that's a problem people aren't reading anymore

250
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:50,480
This is AI this should be reading a book a week

251
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:58,259
It's actually it's offensive to me that people are not reading at least one to two books a week

252
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:15,380
Live watch Jerma 95 live playing clock tower 3 that's not currently happening what

253
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:30,880
Okay, um, I don't I don't know what this is AI generated clip it's not possible

254
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,140
No, this has to be real. How would anybody be able to know that has to be real has to be there's no way

255
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:44,740
This is not real. Absolutely impossible. The AI wouldn't do this, right?

256
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:56,160
Okay, is the guy who couldn't beat preschool games yesterday. Yes, it is. I got my first gift sub in a week

257
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:04,619
I want to see you have a stroke. No, you don't what the fuck

258
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:10,089
I forgot about the part of this game where you rode a giant fat gold, dude, like a train

259
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:29,140
Oh my god, my eye. Did you see that? My island got stuck

260
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:31,339
My

261
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:40,990
It hasn't sunk this low until now real that was even better the second time around robot

262
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:47,440
Oh my god, I'm never gonna get ten. Just get a saddle and ride the horse real. Oh my god

263
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,920
I thought it was in red dead. So Robie is confirmed for next Jerma rumble. I don't know. I don't know what that is

264
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,589
It was no best ice cream this year. I'm sad real Jerma's wearing the foam Hulk hands as he plays real

265
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:09,539
I'm not falling for this shit again. Neither am I? Hey guys, I'm back

266
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:19,500
What's up with this game AI you can use the fire staff in the house AI it all went bad because he has no friends

267
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,990
that's real I

268
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:30,039
TM I'm going to watch your AI. Yeah, you get a little glitched out there a little bit. Mr. Robot

269
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:43,869
I'm going to take a nap. Thanks for the stream. I'll be real. What the fuck? I swear to God

270
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:47,230
I said that all the time. I can't believe this game was made by a fucking gnome real

271
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,839
I think you can use the same hero to do the same thing AI

272
00:33:53,730 --> 00:34:04,460
Secret bub what is secret bub Jerma? Are you sure about this? These are get really hard real

273
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:16,530
There's a secret ending if you go through the red door. Yeah, why is he doing all the DLC again real fuck?

274
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:22,739
I'm never gonna get more than 10. I'm sorry Jerma, but you can't have a bad time. That's AI real question

275
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:33,030
Is why did you play this game real people? I'm gonna go watch the VOD just in case AI

276
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:37,550
If I find a place that does that I'll be arrested for arson at real

277
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:46,719
Jerma versus internet real you should try to get the perfect ending. That's AI mystery streams means he doesn't have a plan

278
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,920
Absolutely real because that's very very true

279
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,000
I said that like a month ago

280
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,159
Mystery streams mean I had no idea what I was doing until about 15 minutes before the stream turns on by the way

281
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,159
There's a mystery stream. Maybe like maybe like once or twice a week

282
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:09,820
Come on, Jerma play some Simpsons music to charge yourself with rage real you can just do a backflip for the items

283
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:26,269
Hey, I I think I'm just gonna go it's kind of sad. I'm sorry for being late

284
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:35,900
I didn't mean to tell you that that's AI one more. Well now VR is becoming a thing. So SBA

285
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:46,570
Oh god, damn it Jerma's going to stream the new Animal Crossing fake. I want to see you get beaten up real

286
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:55,010
I do believe they've made a penis AI. You're not a real gamer. If you don't play fortnight real

287
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,630
I wish this game was more about zombies and less about what time it is real talking about Dead Rising

288
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,900
Jerma you have to be on the edge of the world AI. Jerma this fucking sucks

289
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,539
Please just play a game real. You can also find the GameCube version of this game

290
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:30,199
I've been trying to beat the last boss of Sekiro for the last eight hours straight with no breaks

291
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:44,599
I don't think I can do it. Why not just be in an airplane that flies fast enough to constantly stay at 3pm

292
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:54,650
For like time zones so I can stream

293
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:00,829
Okay, the context there is I was saying I might the time zones are all over the place

294
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:05,579
There's a lot of EU people here and there's like we got to find a good time for you to stream

295
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:10,960
Oh, but like you stream it like two three o'clock Pacific. That's so late. It's like well, it's time zones, man

296
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,420
I can't change that and then somebody wrote why don't you just get in an airplane that goes fast enough to be at 3pm

297
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:27,170
What would happen if you were in a device or like a vehicle that could constantly be at the certain point of the globe?

298
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,030
Where it was three o'clock?

299
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:38,719
What would happen would it be three o'clock for everybody would it be 3 p.m. Everywhere?

300
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:47,329
What if you could go fast enough every time travel you'd know it would only be 3 p.m. In the device

301
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:57,429
Oh, yeah, this is why it's bad unless you're in the same room real

302
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:10,960
So chat has he said anything about streaming today? That's AI about how crazy and we got it at that's real

303
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,159
I remember when Jerma was a dad AI. It's a very good game, but I don't think it's the best one AI

304
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,380
What the fuck is actually what the fuck I actually need Xbox live to go forward real

305
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:31,340
We already told you Super Mario Brothers 2 isn't in this that's I don't know. Oh, wait, wait, wait

306
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,659
Wait, were they talking about Mario maker? I don't know if that's AI

307
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:40,530
They might be talking about Mario maker 2 cuz I was like, oh, I want to make like a Mario 2 level real

308
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:56,900
Yep, I knew it stir was holding back now for his true form. Why do you have a tarantula in your house?

309
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:02,340
I don't Jerma is the most famous person on the planet

310
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:15,099
Somebody may have written this though, even though it's not true

311
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,539
Goddamnit

312
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:28,739
Last run and I'm done last run. This is a like a real game Jerma. I can't believe it. That's fake

313
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:36,719
You said you blasted Katamari in your car with an angry face real you can use it to get more heroes real

314
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,150
I don't know one more the game is making you play this game. That's fake

315
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:46,599
You can make a new house with this mod fake. I think he's gonna be like what the fuck

316
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,039
I'm not going to play this game anymore real. Oh my god

317
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,380
If you play the game, the audio is muted real

318
00:39:54,739 --> 00:40:02,639
You got to get two more and name them coffee and chicken real surprised by his own tendons in his hand

319
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,929
Omega-lul real why do you have to look at the screen fake? Speaking of the screen?

320
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:15,340
What's with the scan lines get a snap for the vacation album real did you know that Jerma is a furry real?

321
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:23,289
All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. This was a lot of fun. What's with the scan lines now?

322
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:33,929
It's time to do the greatest video games of all time. I don't like these scan lines here. I got to fix this

323
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:45,010
By the way now, I'll tell you what those websites were that is the that is the that one was cameo dot Jerma dot IO

324
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,119
in fact

325
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:53,400
there's a lot of stuff in the Jerma dot IO by the same people in person that made the

326
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,099
Rubik's Cube saw game so some really actually really cool stuff. That's really funny

327
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:09,389
I saw that and I had to stream it. It just seems ridiculous. Why is Jerma background moving? It's because the side of scan lines

328
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:22,300
I got to fix this they fix it. What's with these scan lines?

329
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:37,400
Stop that what the hell does anybody else believe

330
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,119
That every fucking webcam that's made in the last ten years never increased in technology

331
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:52,079
They just put they they put a new name on it and just it's like oh this one is came out like a year ago

332
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,800
It's the exact same webcam that came out ten years ago. No technology has changed

333
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,300
I don't I don't think it has a webcam come out in the last like ten years that has

334
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,340
1080p scan lines you need a fucking floodlight to see yourself

335
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:20,239
It's not even this shitty name. It doesn't look like 1080p. It's your monitor rooms light

336
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:32,469
Yeah, but I mean that this doesn't happen all the time. I just made myself more red

337
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:41,429
Looks scary. Why is it doing this?

338
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:45,119
Real can't change the webcams FPS. Yeah

339
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:58,909
Look I'm gonna put it at 50 Hertz 60 Hertz. I'm gonna put it at

340
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:09,789
60 at 30 FPS. Oh my god, what happened? What happened?

341
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:22,260
You know, I always wondered like there's dreamers that have like full-on like DSLR is pointing down at them

342
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,079
I was like, why do people do that? And now I kind of understand now

343
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:33,070
Webcams are such dog shit and they're never gonna get better

344
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:40,829
We good. It's like we can only wait for so long for them to make a webcam

345
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:50,480
There's not like a piece of fucking dog shit in like 12 years. All right, here we go. We good
