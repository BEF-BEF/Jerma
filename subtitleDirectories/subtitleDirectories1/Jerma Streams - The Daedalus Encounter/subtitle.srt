And we need to know if you can respond if you can use the virtual interface in front of you transmit a no

166
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:50,820
Yes, you probably haven't heard but uh the war is over we flame their butts at exeter three

167
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,980
Baccar lost a third of their fleet

168
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,980
They went running with their tails between their legs straight to the taladarans practically begged them to negotiate a peace treaty

169
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,740
We won

170
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,580
You know, of course that put us out of a job, but you know, hey war is hell, right?

171
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,620
So right now you're aboard the artemis finest salvage vessel in the sector

172
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,700
Zach and I cobbled her together from a couple of surplus alliance transports

173
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,299
Oh, not to mention the engines that we sort of borrow stall stall

174
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,250
May not look like much stolen engine detected self-destruct

175
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,850
We thought we'd help salvage some of the vicar ships. We helped disable. It's the very least we could do

176
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,690
We see it. There's a lot of uh, very tasty salvage just floating around out there

177
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,129
All right. Now let's get really really personal

178
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,590
We liberated you from the lab

179
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,309
Zach wired your interface. Are you two together?

180
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,230
Are you dating?

181
00:15:50,230 --> 00:16:00,899
I'll be back casey. Are you two dating? What do you say guys? Let's do some hunting. Oh, I can't do anything

182
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:08,659
It's reverse c man. Yeah, i'm the one that responds the draillac system

183
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:11,220
50 hours later

184
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,879
So we're why can't you just say like

185
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,950
Two days three days

186
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,309
50 hours

187
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:37,879
What's the point of this? What are we what are we supposed to be doing around the sector for two days now?

188
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,600
Maybe we finally got something activating view screens

189
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,490
Okay, we've we got something we have to go out there and clear this

190
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:49,450
Hey case, what do you say you want to take your uh new equipment for a test?

191
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,370
Yeah, let's go. Why don't you go ahead and activate your remote control probe casey

192
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,450
See if you can get us a better look at this derelict

193
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,440
Probe where's the probe? All right

194
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,579
Which was the probe data?

195
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:13,940
Is this like oxygen? All right. Did I just turn it into hydrogen? Okay, start up all subsystems now

196
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:24,420
Oh shit start up subs. Wait, wait, I need the help launches your onboard probe

197
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,130
Okay, here we go. The probe is down here

198
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:35,420
No probe data and analyze. Yes on

199
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,990
Okay, grapple arm system

200
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,220
um launch

201
00:17:47,220 --> 00:18:00,329
Probe, what am I doing? All analysis system. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Did I do it?

202
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,940
What's happening? You didn't give me very good instructions

203
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:20,599
Analysis, what's the analysis one? All right analysis. All right, put the probe on run your diagnostics run your diagnostics

204
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:27,450
Launches you perform system diagnostics on the probe. Oh, it's this one. All right

205
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:34,250
Diagnostics thing what we got. All right launch probe

206
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:46,809
Diagnosing what does it what it would look like? Okay at this point you could have done it yourself

207
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:59,369
Why are you trying to get the toaster to do these very complicated tasks? Okay, deploy the probe casey deploy the probe

208
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:03,289
Opening probe bay doors

209
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:13,450
Now it's me

210
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,450
Is that the dallas?

211
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:27,240
I miss these old cg cutscenes. They look so strange and almost terrifying in a way

212
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,150
Casey I gotta ask you

213
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,390
What does it feel like having your eyes and ears floating around in a little ball while the rest of you is back here with us?

214
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,950
It's fucking horrible. It feels like shit. It's not even funny to joke about

215
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:45,549
Your guidance system is pretty much automatic so you can concentrate on the job. Most other functions are up to you

216
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,069
Yes, oh wait what close call there buddy

217
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:57,710
Collision avoidance seems to be working grab. What do I do? All right, let's try your computer link. See how it works

218
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,230
Why don't you run?

219
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,910
Uh an id check on this pile of junk see if you can get the name of the ship

220
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:07,710
Id check what the cargo might have been am I pulling them over id check?

221
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,309
Which one is that?

222
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,849
It's a

223
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,849
I can't read that. It's so blurry

224
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,769
What is it? You're pulling them over

225
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,559
You know how fast you were going?

226
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:39,519
14 light years per day this is a 12 light year per day zone using your laser torch upper right hand switch

227
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,640
Should pump enough juice into the system pop that door wide open. Be careful casey

228
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,400
Vakar have been known to booby trap their hulks. Come on. Give me that one

229
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,779
Wait, wait, wait

230
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,660
I missed all of that. It said wait. Can you

231
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,569
They booby trap the hulls

232
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,450
Casey I warned you about traps. You just blew our only pro

233
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:12,970
Now we have to go back and start all over again. Thank you

234
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:17,039
It looks so sad

235
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,869
He's dead

236
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:24,029
Thank god. You could just start from right here though

237
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:31,160
Okay, so this is a booby trap. All right analyze

238
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:34,509
Collect use the floodlight

239
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,470
Put the thrusters up launch the probe

240
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,480
What?

241
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,519
Casey I warned you about traps. You just blew our only probe. I'm like a dog that gets the paper towel roll

242
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,160
Put that down

243
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,519
No, i'm not gonna put it down. Give me that and then you get it back and then somehow he gets it again

244
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:10,730
Hey

245
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,730
No bad computer

246
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,319
It's the dotted line

247
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,119
It's not the dotted line

248
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:29,339
I warned you about traps back and start all over again. Thank you

249
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:35,049
Okay, do I have a device I can use

I can't analyze any data. I can't attach I can't grab I can't fling. I can't scream

254
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,460
The bullet hole

255
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,900
It's down here, right?

256
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,140
I can't activate it. I can't activate this either

257
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,490
Is there anything else I can grab?

258
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,309

Wait, what about like wait?

266
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:03,130
Fuck casey. I warned you about traps. You just blew our only probe now. We have to go back and start all over again

267
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,730
Thank you. What my uv light I tried to activate it

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,869
No, I can't talk. There's no data to analyze

276
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:59,759
Wait, let me see. What was analysis on it? Wait, wait, hold on analysis

277
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,440

00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:46,460
Wait, what's that?

Welcome to the encounter step one is virtual control

298
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,119
Step two is to probe and then diagnostics

299
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,319
Step three analysis of the ship blow the hatch

300
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,559
You'll need to use your laser torch to open the cargo door when your laser arms itself aimed on the upper left door controls

Dark in there better kick in the floodlight. I can do that

312
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,839
Oh scary actually did kind of scare me. I always thought you found aliens quite

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,450
Analyze the current environment launch the probe

324
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:05,150
All right analyzing the ship fucking blows

325
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:13,069

Anytime there's an alien spacecraft or an unknown encounter, right?

331
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,920
It's always like this

332
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,240
It's never like a kitchen. They never show like this like the cook

333
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,329
There's never a kitchen. There's never a living room. It's always just weird and oh abnormal

334
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:58,640
There's no bedrooms

335
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Scary ship is just scary ship

336
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,250
There's no actual rooms good

337
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:11,059
He's so high

338
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:26,799
All right analyzing at least we got a nice souvenir. It's gonna be some kind of magical power

339
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:34,029
As well come on in case he's just not our day

340
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:42,180
Wait, I just throw it down the hallway

341
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,920
Didn't she just say that that belongs with the dead?

342
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,559
I'm just gonna toss it down the hall

343
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,190
It's kind of disrespectful

344
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:02,059
This whole sector's why not like put it with this body

345
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,289
I agree a Magellan cluster

346
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:12,910
Why just frisbee it down the hall lv 426. Oh, not there what I was thinking about

347
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:16,509
What time we surprised the hell out of that wing of the car cruiser just leaving the wheel?

348
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:23,950
Yeah, my star system, right? Yeah, and I never saw so many ejection pods in my I feel like such a third wheel right now

349
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:28,910
Not only my third wheel in this current friend group

350
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,650
They turned me into a fucking like task robot

351
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,819
That's extra third wheel

352
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,779
What is it food? Yes

353
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:00,859
Uh 10 community 10 community subs came in from the foolie. Thank you foolie for the 10

354
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,099

Yeah, we're going this way self-trained make him sing I don't sing so

360
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,329
All right tutorial over

361
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:54,799
We're going story branching here. We could have said no

362
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,099
What?

363
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:09,599
Yeah, instead of like zirking off. You probably should have been watching the out your windshield

364
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,779
Oh no, uh analyze the situation

365
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,500
Oh god, damn it. Give me a fucking break. What?

366
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:35,339
No, why why why are you in this? I don't want you in here. I don't want you to do this

367
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,309
I don't want to do this game

368
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:40,299
I don't want to do this one

369
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:42,299
Why is this here? It better not be timed

370
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,390
Okay, what do I what? Okay power

371
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,400
power grid

372
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,299
All right

373
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,660
They've all just turned wwe into the turnbuckle move

374
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:09,139
Hurry save the ship. Is this what it wants?

375
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,599
power

376
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,460
Okay, power one power two

377
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,619
Power three

378
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:23,139
Did I do it connect multiple systems failure? Where's the other one?

379
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,420
Is this one this one up here I can't is that one up there

380
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:36,000
Is that is that is it? I do it. Is that it? I think that's it

381
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,360
all four sides

382
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,429
Well, shit. Okay. Hold on

383
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:51,949
Damn it. All right. So this has to go

384
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,690
Fucking can't believe this shit is in here right now

385
00:34:57,409 --> 00:35:00,480
No, that was right. But then how do I get this one?

386
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:25,630
I fucking hate these things. I hate these

387
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,150
Why of all the things does it have to be a light puzzle?

388
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:36,780
What happened?

389
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,460
I why

390
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:51,780
I hate these things

391
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,780
If you told me that I was gonna have to do light puzzles like turn the pipe shit again

392
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:26,159
I would have shit my pants on camera instead. It's not too late to do that. No, it is too late. No

393
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
No, no, no, no, no, no

394
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,690
I fucking hate this shit

395
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:23,099
No

396
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:29,179
God damn it. It has to connect to this one, but I can't get that one to do what I want it to do

397
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:43,710
Work backwards work backwards hurry before the time runs out up this way down. Oh my fucking god

398
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:56,050
I hate this more than anything calm down and concentrate. I'm gonna but I

399
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:02,769
Calm down or concentrate or drop kick 3do through my hallway. Fuck which one of those bolts sound pretty good to me right now

400
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,010
That's not it. Okay, uh analyze say no

401
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,329
No

402
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:56,849
No, no

403
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:02,480
no

404
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:10,750
I can't wait for one to turn to the camera and there's one small scratch on the forehead with a tiny bit of blood

405
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,579
I'm gonna blame me

406
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:32,460
They were asleep they didn't even crash and get hurt

407
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:52,909
We're dead in the news bad news first, what are you crazy bad has taken us with it there's no way to get clear without our thrusters

408
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,920
We can do it. Do we still have short-range communications? That's me

409
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,530
Send a distress call

410
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:06,050
To who what you think this thing is a ship zack. I don't know but maybe whoever or whatever's on board can help us

411
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:09,809
Yeah, they're not too torqued at you for bashing. See they don't know but

412
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:13,329
I mean this argument's going up to the amazon cloud and they don't even know

413
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:35,809
Id check seems to be of some type of composite material surprise unknown any response to a distress call

414
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,079
So either we figure out how to alter our course we're toast

415
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,070
I hope that we eat first

416
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:59,090
Casey there activate your probe. Let's see what we're dealing with out there. Okay

417
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:07,219
Oh, that's not the probe. All right probe on

418
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,670
Get ready to launch probe

419
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,099
launching probe

420
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,619
Keep voice

421
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:21,889
I will but when I need it propulsion systems activated

422
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:31,139
Analysis system activated launch probe probe ready

423
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:41,699
analyzing data

424
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:46,110
sending probe now in three two one

425
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
zero

426
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,179
I just said that stop trying to overstep me

427
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,619
Always needing to one-up me. There's no way to continue further our relationship

428
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:18,369
Careful out there a better robot voice. Is it not good? I can't I don't know what it is. I can't tell

429
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:24,059
It was stuck in it. There's a big black hole here

430
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,639
Do a fart with the robot filter. All right, this better be worth like five million from that one guy

431
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:46,429
I don't even know what it sounds like

432
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,670
This looks like a cake. Is this even a ship?

433
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,000
This is a fucking calzone

434
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,360
What is this?

435
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:08,929
Harry never seen anything like this. Yeah

436
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,050
Either of I some kind of composite

437
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,250
Alloy or secreted material, I mean did they they build this stuff or grow it

438
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
Right. This is a complete unknown

439
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:28,300
Wait, did you say galaxy is full of unknowns my young son

440
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:32,219
Is that what you said?

441
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:41,139
Yeah, and her sunk a shaft right into the main colony practically wiped out the whole race before the exolinguist established communications

442
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,099
Yeah, well, let's be careful because you're no exolinguist. Hey, I happen to speak 27 languages

443
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,900
Yeah, three phrases more beer. Where's the head and if you want to come by

444
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,739
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah

445
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:58,500
Reorder I have placed a pack of beer on your episode. How are you here? No, no, dude

446
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:03,860
What the fuck alexa hold your position casey zack and I are joining you what what we are

447
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,099
You got a better idea

448
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,579
I guess we don't have much of a choice. All right, let's suit up. I'm going in

449
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,190
Wait, they're going in

450
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,860
They've been computer generated those aren't even real faces anymore

451
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:43,900
That's not video footage. That's actually 3d in the game spy kids

452
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:55,489
It's like it's 3d

453
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:09,699
Be careful if you if you trust too much you'll just incinerate the person behind you

454
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,940
Uh, that's just uh, where's the gravity field? Where is this gravity field?

455
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:21,679
They're gonna go soaring into space

456
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:34,219
Oh, but don't forget me

457
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:44,579
That's definitely a ship take off can I shine my light in there?

458
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,539
Okay

459
00:45:55,539 --> 00:46:02,579
I will I will do the one or two buttons. I've been able to press this entire game. What do you say?

460
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:17,019
This looks actually pretty scary in here. It's fluid on the wall. What is that?

461
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:19,230
See that

462
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,230
What's that? It's like a tail

463
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:33,380
the ship

464
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:54,079
It's gonna be face huggers. I feel so

465
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,360
Like not needed

466
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,579
Why am I just the peter dinklage ghost that they've re-recorded all his lines. What's his name?

467
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:11,900
I just come up with tutorial messages every like five hours

468
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:26,139
Actual side character. I can't even say yes and no

469
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:39,679
This is a pretty good dvd menu game

470
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,210
It's a dvd menu

471
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:55,699
It's a dvd. This is just the special features on prometheus. All right, what does it want me to do grab it analyze?

472
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,420
That is basically the 3d. Oh, yeah

473
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:17,329
Something in there is an egg in there the egg in there. There's an egg. Please insert disc two

474
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,670
Oh shit, this is disc four right here

475
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:32,269
All right. Hold on. It's not gonna break, right?

476
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:38,340
DVD game

477
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,929
All right disc two in

478
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:42,750
What did I just press?

479
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,750
I did like a code blue

480
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:55,280
What is that?

481
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,400
Okay

482
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:07,659
So now what? I'll just say now insert disc one just needed to load the video into cache. I did it

483
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:23,099
There's a brain in here. Oh wait

484
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:33,679
Oh, that's not even me put your face in there

485
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,900
I wonder what this is

486
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:57,380
Take the helmet off and sticks her head in it. Take it off

487
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:05,869
Wait, they're actually gonna take these up. It does not seem like a very firm seal

488
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:10,349
The disc tray on the fucking 3do is more firm seal than that

489
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:31,630
Retired they didn't feel like animating that anymore too much 3d work

490
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,380
Why is she still 3d

491
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,449
She's still oh, no, no, no. Okay now they're not anymore

492
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,460
I don't think it knows what a gun is

493
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:09,469
Why would you touch this what are you doing?

494
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:14,909
This doesn't know what a gun is what you this is not the triceratops from jurassic park

495
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,300
That's the reason for the hole in the other room

496
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,690
what

497
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:30,289
Ship's been invaded by crin cringe. Oh what you just said was so cringe kind of like piranhas

498
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:32,849
It could be thousands of them in here

499
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,599
Thousands of piranhas great

500
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,030
Something in the head built-in flashlight. No, it's gonna explode

501
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:45,469
Maybe it's one of the ways they communicate it's gonna explode

502
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:52,800
It's dead

503
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,119
See that was a last ditch communication like tell my wife. I love her

504
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,440
Stuff is harder than a drill sergeant's head crin can do this

505
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,519
We have no idea

506
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,679
That could have been the password that could have been like the password to the laptop that has all the btc on it from like

507
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,000
fucking 2004

508
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,190
We'll never know

509
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,949
I don't think this thing's dead

510
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:26,829
No, it's not it's good. It's wagging its tail

511
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:33,039
We just get duped

512
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:43,619
Well wick always said the most terrifying thing he ever saw was a full-scale crin attack

513
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,820
Old man hard wick actually talked to you

514
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:50,239
Actually, we got along quite well

515
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:55,059
This just really is what it's like to be a side character

516
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:58,659
Like a party member that gives advice sometimes that doesn't do any of the game playing

517
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,539
You just kind of walk around and look at walls and stuff

518
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:11,460
Yeah, i'd say so let's try opening this thing careful

519
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,079
Yeah, I have my list of tutorial messages I can show up

520
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:21,039
uh

521
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,400
Did you know that if you press tab you can get to the map?

522
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:31,940
Wait a minute that casey can make it through me me me

523
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:35,619
Go ahead casey see if you can make it through

524
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:48,719
Come on go squeeze in there. I found the heart

525
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,280
There's gonna be some kind of jewel in here. We're gonna take the jewel in indiana jones style. The whole thing's gonna collapse

526
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,440
Pods, this is where they burrow their larva

527
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:19,809
Alexa I was just gonna yell like alexa order this but I

528
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:23,570
It was a joke like as if it's here, but it's not here and I can say that out loud

529
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,210
But I don't want to say that out loud because some of you might actually have it

530
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,710
And you might i'm up on your tv speakers. I can't do that either

531
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,289
Alexa order of jewel pods

532
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:57,059
What's that jewel pods there's a crab in there what casey

533
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:01,780
Casey what happened right there? Yeah, did you see anything that looked like navigational controls?

534
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,690
Oh, uh

535
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,690
Yeah, um, um, no

536
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,329
Guess we better try another one of these doors

537
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,019
Yeah

538
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:21,019
Hey casey, let's try this one

539
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:28,849
slow robot

540
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:31,809
Come on. Give me a break. They built me with parts that they had lying around

541
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:37,650
How many like random graphics cards do you still have in your closet? I thought casey was the only one that could open these

542
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,610
Guys I held on to a gtx 270 for like six fucking years

543
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,920
Sorry, I don't have the latest hardware built into this guy

544
00:55:55,019 --> 00:56:02,239
Why I don't know because just in case I needed it for something. I don't have it anymore. It's gone now

545
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,750
I hold on to a lot of computer hardware like you're supposed to hold on to your tax returns

546
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,150
seven years

547
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:15,539
And then and I get rid of it. Oh my god. Why are you drinking like the random acid?

548
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,500
what

549
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,500
What the fuck?

550
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,670
You always didn't know how to make me laugh

551
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,670
Why don't you walk up to a random?

552
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,139
What the hell are you looking at cyclops?

553
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:42,659
What is happening really what is happening in this game

554
00:56:46,429 --> 00:56:51,469
You don't know what's so damn funny, right? That was an honest mistake. Oh, trust me for my angle. It was hilarious

555
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,829
Can can we just go now?

556
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,510
This is turning into an snl skin first now that you're all refreshed

557
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:06,900
Hey

558
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,429
Well, all of a sudden i'm r2 d2

559
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:17,409
So let me okay. I gotta break this down. Let me get this straight guy walks into room in an alien spacecraft

560
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,650
And it's all this weird shit around it

561
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,730
Immediately drinks out of the first liquid

562
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,420
That you find the first thing that's holding liquid you just start drinking it

563
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,760
Is this a dnd campaign?

564
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,840
with new players

565
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:39,440
There's no sign of any weapons whatsoever

566
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,809
I didn't even put up a fight. Maybe they didn't have any weapons

567
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:49,219
They built a spaceship you enter a room with a strange fountain

568
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,139
And inside I drink out of the fountain. I'm saying maybe it shows not

569
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,380
Okay, roll I guess um

570
00:57:57,619 --> 00:58:17,519
But this one is different roll for hydration

571
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:24,000
Oh, here we go. This is the real this is the room now. Oh, we really did it now people are porting into here

572
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:28,219
Get the weapons ready

573
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:32,369
What do I have? I have robot fork penis. I'm ready

574
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:35,170
Looks like some kind of central hub

575
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:39,389
Seems heavily reinforced you think this would uh, keep those crayon out

576
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,789
I don't know maybe

577
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,789
But we're not staying here to find out

578
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:46,670
Gotta steer this thing away from the star. Remember?

579
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:49,570
Yeah

580
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,969
These symbols over the doors might tell us what's on the other side

581
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:56,900
Oh, they're not porting in what are they doing?

582
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,170
Why am I so interested in this game still I kind of am don't you want to know what's happening?

583
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,849
I kind of want to know the story

584
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:04,610
I'm I want to know

585
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:22,340
I'm getting a little invested. Yeah, me too

586
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,090
So this must be the died alice

587
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:38,619
Should I say something? Hey casey, we can't come up with anything here. All these doors are sealed

588
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:43,340
We need your help to open them. Let's start with the one to the left of the door. We came in

589
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:48,019
That one

590
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:51,570
Oh no, it's gonna be a puzzle

591
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:54,099
Okay

592
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:56,099
w o i

593
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:01,329
bulk

594
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:04,909
bolt

595
01:00:04,909 --> 01:00:15,840
Analyze the door. Okay. It looks like there is a dial in there. It's gonna be a puzzle something maybe

596
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,940
alien pattern found

597
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,789
chroma symbols

598
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:23,150
Take a look at this

599
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:28,739
possible language

600
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:33,219
Take a look at that data. Okay. Can I open it? What else can we do?

601
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:43,519
Enhance it the playstation language

602
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,539
Yeah, it is

603
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:56,219
Okay, I have the data so now I go back

604
01:00:57,949 --> 01:01:00,429
I've got hey, yes, I found something

605
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,760
Okay, so this is what's this look like?

606
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,239
So now how can I move this around?

607
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,960
Analyze it again

608
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,789
Press the button. I can't press anything

609
01:01:16,349 --> 01:01:18,909
Press no, I have this

610
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:23,949
This is a color scheme and an alien language, but can I go back and say hey, I found something

611
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:26,190
Use your fork

612
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,269
Use the rainbow

613
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:30,139

What is it doing? I have to make what do I have to make?

622
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:11,099
One of those symbols, but I don't know what symbol is supposed to make just complete the whole thing

623
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,690

669
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,420
Bullshit puzzle. It's stupid

670
01:09:26,659 --> 01:09:39,380
That doesn't tell you how to beat it. No, it just tells you that it exists

671
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:44,289
It's simple

672
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:47,569
It's not simple. It's stupid. It's I hate it

673
01:09:49,329 --> 01:09:57,520
Wait, maybe it is simple. Hold on

674
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:29,760
Oh

675
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:42,789
Just press them all fast

676
01:10:42,789 --> 01:10:46,310
Hold on. I think I got it. I think I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it

677
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,350
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it

678
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:50,310
Just relax relax

679
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,399
This walkthrough doesn't work

680
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:03,920
Come on the walkthrough king. He's gonna get me

681
01:11:08,789 --> 01:11:11,270
Purple door. What this isn't even

682
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:19,029
What the fuck? None of these these are all doesn't make any sense

683
01:11:19,829 --> 01:11:30,239
They're all this one's not even a paragraph long. I beat this puzzle when I was four

684
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:36,659
You didn't even own a 3do. None of you did this radio like sold 400 copies. You're not one of them. It's randomized

685
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:42,050
No, it's not

686
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:57,010
Wait, oh, here we go. There's a play. There's a hold on this walkthrough. I don't know

687
01:11:58,289 --> 01:12:00,050
I hate it

688
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:05,729
Where's the just it's just not even a puzzle

689
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:12,369
All right, the didalus encounter walkthrough part two

690
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,460
dude all these

691
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:38,079
Where is this part of the fucking game? Oh, it's on part four. Okay match each one

692
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,640
I know I know it's probably easy but like I i'd rather fucking eat the disc than do this

693
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:53,159
All right. Got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Here we go

694
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:59,109
Wait, what this is?

695
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:01,430
No, I just skipped to the next video. Why is

696
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:05,029
YouTube fuck youtube. Why is next video?

697
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:10,470
Two pixels away from the play button fucking move that shit your website sucks

698
01:13:19,779 --> 01:13:23,060
This walkthrough doesn't even have this part because it's on easy this

699
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,060
Walkthrough i'm watching is on easy. So it only has the first part

700
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,539
The only reason why we have part two is because the game's on medium

701
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:40,439
Hey

702
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:50,600
God damn it. Not even the walkthrough could help me because the walkthrough is on easy

703
01:13:52,609 --> 01:13:54,609
You had it move the bottom left one

704
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:05,779
No, no, no, no, no, what do you know what happened top left the top left one

705
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,960
Oh

706
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:14,439
I don't want to do it again

707
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:29,829
That one wasn't even hard

708
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:38,960
No, but yeah, fuck you too. Fuck your dumb sight with oh, let's put the play button right next to the skip button

709
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:41,039
That's a good idea. Why not?

710
01:14:43,569 --> 01:14:47,329
You know, I just noticed something you're giving an awful lot of orders for civilian

711
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:50,500
I do outrank you

712
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:54,979
You did outrank me and the only reason you did was because you were a lot better at kissing ass than I was

713
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:01,699
Everything I got I earned the hard way just because you kept getting busted for insubordination. Oh, hey, hey

714
01:15:01,779 --> 01:15:04,100
I know what you're talking about. Okay, you know, that wasn't my fault

715
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:09,380
Oh the hell it wasn't you went out of your way to disobey the orders. You never could accept ranking authority

716
01:15:09,859 --> 01:15:11,859
Let me explain something to you. Okay?

717
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,659
If I take an order from you, it's because I choose to got it

718
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:23,829
Okay

719
01:15:24,069 --> 01:15:26,310
Where the hell are you going pissed at you too?

720
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,670
I really am r2

721
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,039
Another door puzzle. I don't want to do another door puzzle

722
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:55,670
Let's try this way I do play as the camera

723
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,239
Oh, this this room looks interesting. It's it's it's read in this goop

724
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:18,149
Do an r2d2 scream? I did that like two days ago

725
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:22,100
What was that?

726
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,539
I don't know

727
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:25,699
It's coming from over there loss fight

728
01:16:27,859 --> 01:16:29,859
Oh shit here comes a print

729
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:45,520
They're on germany at eight five stream, there are thousands of using these air ducts to get around the ship

730
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:52,579
It's great, that's just terrific

731
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:57,460
It's a little too close for comfort for me. I agree. Let's get out of here right in front of you

732
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:02,100
I really hope there's a fight, please give us a fight

733
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:11,460
All right, we're fine

734
01:17:12,579 --> 01:17:19,409
Don't forget they're hurtling they're going towards the sun. Oh, that's true. Yeah

735
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,520
Not enough for a budget fight

736
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,869
Hey, are you getting a weird feeling like the hair on the back of your neck wants to stand on it?

737
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:32,789
Yeah

738
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:36,609
Kind of like we just walked into an intense electromagnetic feel

739
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,760
Yeah

740
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,069
Harry wait a minute. This looks familiar. Look

741
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,289
generator power comments

742
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:51,579
Emergency cooling this is this has got to be an engine

743
01:17:53,899 --> 01:17:55,899
You just may be right this time

744
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,819
You know, you don't have to act so surprised I am

745
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,380
Okay, let's split up and look around Nintendo. Okay, so you take the left corridor

746
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,619
That's what I thought she said too, but I figured I was gonna get minus two if I said that

747
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:31,760
All right, what are we looking for? Minus two for thinking

748
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:40,829
Come on

749
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:42,829
This is an early movie game

750
01:18:43,489 --> 01:18:44,449
Yeah

751
01:18:44,449 --> 01:18:47,300
This is what all your favorite movie games

752
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,720
Are sort of based on

753
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,460
actor in the golden age of the 3do

754
01:18:56,579 --> 01:18:58,579
early pc game

755
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:06,579
They made these all the time because graphics weren't that good the real life looked great

756
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,460
That's why there was a shitload of fmv games

757
01:19:14,739 --> 01:19:16,739
Oh

758
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:28,079
What did she get this

759
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:30,319
What what happened to him? He didn't even touch him

760
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:33,939
And why is she about to like crack his back?

761
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:39,119
Did he pass out from fear?

762
01:19:43,899 --> 01:19:48,779
Oh, he cringed so hard at that last joke, but he just he couldn't go on he passed out

763
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:57,010
One of those little flying things made an r2 d2 noise and he cringed to fucking death

764
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:11,649
Just wrap why why can't I help don't forget about me?

765
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:31,060
Oh, that's yes it is

766
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:40,960
Um, you're like you're like 25 in this video. I believe you're like less than 30 in this

767
01:20:54,909 --> 01:20:58,239
38 really

768
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:10,979
Alive but not you case I was not talking

769
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,399
You never changed

770
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:20,319
Is this like the the monologue where she describes to be the villain of the story?

771
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,819
Always there for us

772
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:30,109
Straight and steady and now you've changed too

773
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,890
I'm gonna have to put you down

774
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:43,729
Do you still feel?

775
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:46,420
Yes

776
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:48,020
I do

777
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:51,020
It would be nice to hear your voice again

778
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:58,420
I think the med techs were working on a speech interpolation system when we pulled you from the lab. I'm sorry

779
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:00,420
We weren't such a hurry pull me from the lab

780
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:04,000
I don't know who i'm supposed to be

781
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,039
You know when we get out of this thing, i'm gonna find you somebody that can

782
01:22:08,859 --> 01:22:10,859
Somebody that can build your voice

783
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,079
That's a promise

784
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,800
You're okay was I wait was I a robot the whole time?

785
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,600
I was another passenger on the ship

786
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:29,149
Oh, yeah, I was on I was another crew member, right?

787
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:36,819
Long elevator

788
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:58,449
Does that mean fourth floor ladies lingerie

789
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:04,930
Mall joke

790
01:23:21,819 --> 01:23:23,819
Casey why don't you see if you can figure this thing out

791
01:23:29,979 --> 01:23:33,020
See if I can figure it out. All right. Oh, no, I can't wait to not

792
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:40,270
I can't wait to get very angry in about 45 seconds. Let's analyze it. It's gonna be another ship

793
01:23:40,909 --> 01:23:44,590
It's gonna be another robot communication thing and we're gonna communicate with each other

794
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:46,750
right

795
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,750
That would be a pretty cool twist

796
01:23:48,909 --> 01:23:54,029
If I end up talking to the robot in here and I get like the story and it's not bad

797
01:23:54,430 --> 01:24:03,010
The robot's just doing you know what the rope this robot's doing and i'm owned by these people whatever that'd be kind of cool

798
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:13,739
All right, I just pressed. I don't know what I just did. I got it. I opened it

799
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:21,100
It's beautiful. Yeah

800
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:37,630
Maybe some kind of sundial sure sun harry

801
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:43,229
If you're through fantasizing about me, i'd like to find a way out of here. You want to keep looking around

802
01:24:43,229 --> 01:24:46,029
Why did she just nod like goes off controls?

803
01:24:46,829 --> 01:24:53,869
Uh casey, why don't you keep working on this it might help it was weird

804
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:00,689
Oh shit. Okay

805
01:25:00,689 --> 01:25:02,510
analyze this

806
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:04,590
um, okay press this

807
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:07,699
Okay, red

808
01:25:07,699 --> 01:25:09,100
red

809
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,460
red

810
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:15,010
Red activate

811
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,399
I have to match the colors if they're in

812
01:25:22,449 --> 01:25:26,449
They all have to be the same color blue everything has to be blue. No, everything has to be blue blue blue blue blue

813
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:32,289
Turn to blue everything has to be red red red red red everything has to be orange orange

814
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:37,220
Red everything wait

815
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:51,819
I have to just put the colors in the right spots, but there's no green

816
01:25:54,399 --> 01:26:00,079
What color am I supposed to make this?

817
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:11,340
I don't get it either red purple make you make it purple

818
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:25,680
It's blue blue. Oh, it's all purple. I got it. Everything's purple did I win?

819
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:52,449
I don't I don't know what it wants me to do

820
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:54,930
Oh

821
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:04,210
So this is this the outside is has colors and then the inside has colors I

822
01:27:04,609 --> 01:27:12,210
Okay, I get it. We need to combine whatever is in so this like, you know, for instance yellow and green makes

823
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:23,020
Blue no yellow and blue makes green right? So this is green going into here. What does

824
01:27:23,659 --> 01:27:29,810
Red and yellow makes orange. Okay, so we have blue

825
01:27:30,529 --> 01:27:35,250
Or I don't understand. I have no idea what this wants me to do. You're overthinking this like crazy

826
01:27:35,489 --> 01:27:37,489
I don't know. I don't get it. What does it want to do?

827
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:55,170
Just match the colors to the outside. I can't do that. There's no green. There's no green

828
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:09,710
There's no green and there's no blue

829
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:13,569
And match the other ones

830
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:16,909
All right, so I did

831
01:28:16,909 --> 01:28:18,909
They already are done. There's no orange

832
01:28:20,029 --> 01:28:22,829
This is I already did it. I've matched it. What about the manual?

833
01:28:28,449 --> 01:28:30,930
clicking on the outer ring of the hemisphere

834
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:38,260
Oh, never mind. I thought I had it clicking on the

835
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:41,060
outer ring of the

836
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:48,689
Clicking on the outer ring of the hemispheres causes two of them to change colors

837
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:55,329
The goal is to change all of the hemispheres to yellow. Okay, great that I would never have known that I had to make them all yellow

838
01:28:56,770 --> 01:29:00,350
I made them all purple

839
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:22,800
Like how was I supposed to know that all of them had to be yellow I made them all purple

840
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:37,819
We have to drive this thing. Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here. Don't you?

841
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,140
Yeah, okay. Let's meet up and move out. Yeah

842
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:45,020
Yeah

843
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:51,979
Wait, wait, wait, you hear that it's in there

844
01:29:55,069 --> 01:30:00,180
It's the cringe yep

845
01:30:21,539 --> 01:30:23,539
You killed him

846
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:29,890
Oh, no

847
01:30:30,449 --> 01:30:33,729
I don't think that's the first time they've given me an opportunity to shoot anything

848
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,739
All right. I need to shoot her shoot her next

849
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,960
Ah

850
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,520
Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here. Don't you?

851
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:46,340
Yeah

852
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:50,659
Look, do you really expect the robot that takes 40 minutes to complete a children's

853
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,579
Match puzzle to be able to aim a weapon correctly

854
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:02,060
You killed him. That was more funny to me than anything else

855
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:06,500
Look right in the camera right in my eyes. You killed him

856
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:18,180
He's shooting he tried he's killed me

857
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:24,640
His last ditch effort was i'm gonna kill this motherfucker. He got it. He got his final thing his final wish

858
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:31,539
What a way to end that I kill her he gets stabbed through the throat and then kills me

859
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,420
This is this is a tarantino movie

860
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:45,470
Listen, I think we've done enough. Don't you?

861
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:49,100
Yeah, okay. Let's meet up and move out

862
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,000
You killed him

863
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:01,659
Wait, wait, wait, you hear that coming from the bodies

864
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,140
So I have to shoot the aliens that come out

865
01:32:04,779 --> 01:32:10,800
Here we go

866
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:21,340
This is so lame. This is what you look like when you play vr

867
01:32:24,829 --> 01:32:26,189
They're everywhere

868
01:32:26,189 --> 01:32:36,289
I got one. What was he doing?

869
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:40,449
Oh, wait, what is he doing? He shoots behind his head like three times

870
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,460
He's aiming at the ground

871
01:32:47,739 --> 01:32:51,329
So

872
01:33:21,699 --> 01:33:26,739
You know what you can't blame them for that either though like these actors they're in front of a green screen

873
01:33:26,739 --> 01:33:28,180
They have no idea

874
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:30,180
There's somebody right there going and

875
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:35,220
Action shoot all around you shoot shoot shoot look out behind you behind you behind you get that one

876
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:39,699
Get one duck duck duck duck. They're everywhere. They're everywhere. They're on the ground. They're everywhere

877
01:33:39,779 --> 01:33:41,380
There's one crawling on you

878
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:46,340
And then the effects artist has to take all this thing that the director told them to do and be like I

879
01:33:46,659 --> 01:33:49,069
What am I supposed to do with this shit?

880
01:33:49,069 --> 01:33:51,630
They're supposed to be flying around the ship. They're not supposed to be on the ground

881
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,890
You can't blame the actress they're doing they're doing their best

882
01:34:00,529 --> 01:34:11,859
For all things considered they are

883
01:34:11,859 --> 01:34:16,539
Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here. Don't you they're doing their best for porn actors

884
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:19,899
Tia what's her name?

885
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:22,539
Tia

886
01:34:22,539 --> 01:34:23,920
What's her name?

887
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,920
She was famous actress

888
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,340
Tia carrera tia carrera

889
01:34:30,619 --> 01:34:34,939
She was in wayne's world. She no. Yeah, she was a very she was like an a-lister at one point

890
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,520
Oh shit

891
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Shit, oh shit

892
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:48,640
What does this game have for a rating?

893
01:34:52,779 --> 01:34:58,100
Shit you say shit the t game

894
01:34:58,899 --> 01:35:02,670
Did you just grab one off her shoulder?

895
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:22,579
All right, there's how many how many what do we have to do? How long is this?

896
01:35:27,949 --> 01:35:29,949
I want one of them to stub their toe on something

897
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:35,069
Just look at somebody that's been in front of a green screen doing this exact thing this exact thing

898
01:35:35,789 --> 01:35:37,789
It's fucking tiring and it's painful

899
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,460
In fact, I hope somebody puts me in this scene

900
01:35:49,859 --> 01:35:51,859
Now they are they are they syrup?

901
01:35:52,579 --> 01:35:56,699
What am I doing? What do I do?

902
01:35:58,939 --> 01:36:05,920
I have to save one of them

903
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,439
Extend the hand

904
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:08,800
Turn the thrusters off

905
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,720
analyze

906
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:13,470
data

907
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:26,079
Wait, did I just hit my head?

908
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:30,399
In a panic I ran around and scoopy do shaggy somehow

909
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,159
Saved the day

910
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:48,180
What do you want me to do analyze the damage? Jesus christ. What is this?

911
01:36:48,659 --> 01:36:55,359
Okay, this connects

912
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:59,090
Connect them connect all of them

913
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:13,939
Shit, okay. They have their color coded. This is yellow when I press the okay

914
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:19,569
So that yellow is gonna make all the ones that are yellow move red is gonna make the ones that are red move

915
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:34,590
Blue is gonna make all the ones that are blue move. I just did it. Damn it. I didn't hold on. I did it

916
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:41,840
That's it. No, what that's not what that is

917
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:54,109
But some have two colors. Yeah. Yeah, but okay when I press this yellow one ready watch

918
01:37:54,510 --> 01:38:02,750
You would assume that all the ones that have a yellow square are the ones that open or close, right? Okay, so then

919
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:09,869
With this theory it's done. These are the only two yellows, right?

920
01:38:10,979 --> 01:38:17,439
For this one here. Okay. Now we need to do this one and then we have to have one that's ripped to do a red

921
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:25,789
Now it's it's done. I did it. Wait. No, I didn't. Hold on. Wait. Hold on

922
01:38:26,350 --> 01:38:38,449
Shit, but we'll open. Okay. This will open. I need to okay

923
01:38:39,409 --> 01:39:09,819
Open the yellows and then close all the blues and yellows shit red or blue. God damn it

924
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:16,670
I think that's it. Did I do it? No

925
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:24,939
Stupid blue the stupid blue one. I had to press this one

926
01:39:36,619 --> 01:39:38,060
Now that's it

927
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:49,279
Right. Hold on. I need to do so red red will this will close all the reds and the yellows. This is open

928
01:39:49,520 --> 01:40:21,600
Why why does this one have to be open? All right, wait, wait, wait blue and yellow you stupid motherfucker

929
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:28,460
It doesn't help that it's wicked ugly, too

930
01:40:28,539 --> 01:40:49,250
It's this the ones that the doubles the doubles would just fuck everything up blue and red blue blue and red

931
01:40:50,399 --> 01:41:03,920
That's it. No, it's not god damn it press the one red one and then the yellow blue one

932
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:19,729
This is the kind of ipad game that I download sometimes

933
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:24,930
I play the first three levels and I go nope and I hold my thumb on the icon and I delete the app

934
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:38,800
So why even have the greens here? They don't do anything. It's all this yellow blue red shit

935
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:45,149
Now if I do this one, it'll close all the yellow ones. I don't want to do that. I want to

936
01:41:46,029 --> 01:41:51,699
do um, um a

937
01:41:52,180 --> 01:42:15,020
uh, and then um, I don't even I don't even care a puzzle. I don't do puzzles. I've run wicked fast

938
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:24,000
You know what I mean? Like that's that's not what I do. I don't care. Hit the blue one. No. Oh I did

939
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:48,260
You gave up at the finish line looks like everything's up and running again

940
01:42:48,819 --> 01:42:51,619
It's a good thing too because we need you to open another door

941
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:54,699
Go to it case

942
01:42:54,699 --> 01:42:56,720
What?

943
01:42:56,720 --> 01:43:00,800
I've repaired myself for them to make me open a new door with another puzzle

944
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,310
Is that all i'm worth to you guys?

945
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:19,329
I just saved both of your lives twice. Remember when you got sucked out of the window and I had to come to your rescue

946
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:21,500
remember when

947
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,979
You were being swarmed by aliens and I shot all of them. Not one of you

948
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:28,939
Got one kill

949
01:43:28,939 --> 01:43:48,079
Okay, so put it up. Please insert disc three

950
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,119
This one is gonna be hell. I can already tell

951
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:57,279
We're already at disc three. We're this we're gonna beat this game. I think I think we're actually gonna beat this game

952
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:08,180
And for all for all the the naysayers in here

953
01:44:08,739 --> 01:44:10,659
um

954
01:44:10,659 --> 01:44:15,060
If I have a sort of a gauge of how I gauge if i'm going to complete a video game or not

955
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:17,380
If you get to disc three out of four

956
01:44:18,779 --> 01:44:20,819
Just do the whole thing

957
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:33,060
It's probably like another 40 minutes in this damn game. That's not sunk cost. That's I want to see the end

958
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:51,789
Virgin interactive. What about it? All right. What am I trying to make here?

959
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,279
Uh, am I supposed to fill the whole thing in a certain color?

960
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:07,949
What does the manual say manual says?

961
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:16,930
Well, this would be the uh, the blue door, right? Okay

962
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:22,529
When you rotate the outer hexagons by clicking on them, the corresponding shape is also rotated in the center hexagon

963
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:28,130
If any of the colored shapes intersect in the center hexagon the overlapping triangles turn gray

964
01:45:28,529 --> 01:45:33,090
The goal is to rotate the shapes so that there are no gray triangles in the center

965
01:45:35,340 --> 01:46:04,800
Easy, this is not going to be easy. All right, that one fits up there. Wait, that one fits in there. That's right there

966
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:08,380
All right. We got something wrong here

967
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:12,800
Something wrong here. It's this guy

968
01:46:14,529 --> 01:46:26,449
Get it. I what there's more. Oh dear. No, no, no, no, no, no, there's gonna be three of these. Yeah

969
01:46:27,569 --> 01:46:44,260
No, I don't want to do this. Okay, there's everyone. Where can I fit you? Wait, wait, okay, that's good

970
01:46:47,899 --> 01:46:56,109
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, is it the green go to this orange?

971
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:00,800
Orange you gotta go this way

972
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:08,939
No, no

973
01:47:08,939 --> 01:47:09,739
No

974
01:47:09,739 --> 01:47:23,010
No, it's wrong. Yellow absolutely goes right here. Red is absolutely right there pink. Oh pink is absolutely not over there

975
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:31,810
Or is it it might be? Oh, yeah pink is absolutely over there. Okay. What about over here? Wait, absolutely

976
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:52,609
What goes here though? Nothing fits in that spot right there. Does anything go there?

977
01:47:54,829 --> 01:48:08,130
That does but what else can go there? Okay. Wait, that is I think that's the only solution there yellow you moron

978
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:11,939
All right. Hey the next time you're doing like a sudoku

979
01:48:11,939 --> 01:48:16,739
I'm gonna stand over your shoulder and when you when you do one wrong and you like erase it with your pencil

980
01:48:16,739 --> 01:48:22,180
I'm gonna go like you idiot. You're stupid and you're gonna go fucking around with my puzzle man

981
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:26,829
Leave me alone then i'm gonna drink the rest of the coffee that's on the pot

982
01:48:27,659 --> 01:48:33,260
And fucking walk like upstairs and then you're gonna go for a coffee like around two second coffee. I'm gonna be fucking furious

983
01:48:33,260 --> 01:49:20,079
That's enough left. I did it. I drank it. All right. Hold on. What's this? No, this is right. That's okay

984
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:23,380
What should red be down here?

985
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:28,399
No, red's right

986
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:31,119
Blue is not right

987
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,720
Yellow's not right either

988
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:44,510
Hold on. I don't know orange and green orange and green orange and green orange and green

989
01:49:45,149 --> 01:49:47,710
Yeah, that makes sense

990
01:49:47,710 --> 01:49:51,970
That makes sense. But what's taking up this spot over here?

991
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,260
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

992
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:59,649
That's

993
01:49:59,649 --> 01:50:01,810
I didn't fill one in

994
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:06,560
What's that little space right there? I didn't fill in I was trying to fill that in

995
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:12,829
Casey

996
01:50:12,829 --> 01:50:18,109
I guess you need to leave one spot. This is amazing. Look at the size of it

997
01:50:19,229 --> 01:50:21,229
Harry can't even see the bottom here

998
01:50:24,579 --> 01:50:26,579
More monkey noises now. All right fine

999
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:48,739
Did you just try to grab his gun

1000
01:50:51,859 --> 01:50:55,060
You both almost died twice this is not a place to fuck around

1001
01:50:56,579 --> 01:50:57,859
like

1002
01:50:57,859 --> 01:50:59,779
He's spitting on me

1003
01:50:59,779 --> 01:51:11,310
But am I not allowed to hang out on the platform with them?

1004
01:51:11,949 --> 01:51:25,569
Die now let's encounter

1005
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:29,869
The bones

1006
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:44,510
50 chat message trying to help the stream and all he does is call us morons

1007
01:51:44,510 --> 01:51:49,310
All he struggles finish the simpleton puzzle. You know, the streamer is the moron. He's being mean to us. I'm not seven

1008
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:53,140
Give me back this ship isn't that big

1009
01:51:53,699 --> 01:51:56,449
It's gotta be a projection

1010
01:51:56,449 --> 01:51:58,739
Or an illusion

1011
01:51:58,739 --> 01:52:00,739
Hey, hey, wait, maybe that

1012
01:52:00,739 --> 01:52:03,699
Yeah, see you tomorrow feel we went through before somehow, you know

1013
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,560
Transported us to the home world

1014
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:08,739
Transported

1015
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:09,939
Yeah

1016
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:16,100
Why can we breathe out here star trek reruns what happened to the space suits

1017
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:24,130
Fresh air there's even a breeze

1018
01:52:24,850 --> 01:52:28,750
This is an illusion. It's pretty damn convincing

1019
01:52:29,229 --> 01:52:32,750
It's actually kind of funny if they found a little door over here and they opened it and it was like a big set

1020
01:52:33,710 --> 01:52:35,710
Cameras and stuff and they were like, oh shit

1021
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:38,270
Closed it is real. Yeah, I guess we are all right here

1022
01:52:45,789 --> 01:52:47,789
It wasn't real it was a mirage

1023
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:50,670
It was fake

1024
01:52:52,529 --> 01:52:54,529
Don't put your face that close

1025
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:17,970
You had to do make like the jokes and make the condescending remarks and now he's dead

1026
01:53:30,859 --> 01:53:46,369
What I let go of him when did I let go of him I didn't press anything I didn't I I didn't

1027
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:49,010
Jesus christ, I didn't press anything

1028
01:53:49,569 --> 01:53:56,619
He grasped me. He says, oh, thank god. I love you. And then I what do I do? He didn't give me a prompter

1029
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:02,779
thrusters

1030
01:54:02,779 --> 01:54:12,380
All right thruster press. Yes

1031
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:19,569
No

1032
01:54:19,569 --> 01:54:21,569
What is this is thruster, right?

1033
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,520
This is thruster right here, right?

1034
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:32,899
This is thruster. Let's go

1035
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:39,859
Well, look this has like the lines on it. That's the thrust line

1036
01:54:40,859 --> 01:54:43,260
What should I do something and have to dodge anything?

1037
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:58,640
Uh, I think we're just going

1038
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:22,350
Wouldn't he have fallen? Oh, okay. No. Yeah, he would have he would have just fallen right through isn't the ground here

1039
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:35,340
Child a child

1040
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,760
Is this the

1041
01:56:02,319 --> 01:56:09,359
You rented like the 45 minute hour like that. It's not even an hour and 30 minutes. It's like 48 minute long porn movie

1042
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:15,439
And they just do this the entire movie until the last 12 minutes

1043
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:26,229
And all of you just fast forward to the last 12 minutes

1044
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:41,090
You're speaking from experience

1045
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:47,520
Yes

1046
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:50,479
No, i've never seen a pornographic film in my entire life

1047
01:56:52,529 --> 01:56:58,850
That's disgusting to me what you just said, how dare you ever even assume that i've seen one of these just disgusting

1048
01:56:58,989 --> 01:57:00,989
revolting pornographic films

1049
01:57:02,779 --> 01:57:08,829
Oh, I drink water and I do my uh chores, you know, are there anything else?

1050
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:24,300
I'm glad that let's take a look around. Yeah. Yeah, I can manage that remember this time. I know I know I know be careful

1051
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:27,020

1052
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:30,270
What how do you where do you get that from?

1053
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Chores is watch porn

1054
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:56,189
Sometimes it feels like that. Don't it? What is this?

1055
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:10,380
like

1056
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:15,180
All right, what's today? Today's uh, thursday. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I did I got the mail

1058
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,520
I jumped I guess time to do this

1059
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:36,220
I'm not tired yet. What time is it?

1060
01:58:36,699 --> 01:58:38,699
Oh, it's like it's like 8 30

1061
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:42,369
I'm not gonna fall asleep for like another six hours or so probably

1062
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:45,250
Wow, thank you. I mean, I mean I guess

1063
01:58:56,529 --> 01:59:00,210
I

1064
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:02,210
Stop talking

1065
01:59:03,409 --> 01:59:09,250
I can't wait. I can joke and make fuck around about like everything else but not about like be careful

1066
01:59:09,569 --> 01:59:11,170
Don't talk about this

1067
01:59:11,170 --> 01:59:16,859
it's the one thing that's off limits besides politics and that's even bullshit because you've heard me do like

1068
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:32,029
Every politician's voice you've heard on this stream. Yeah. All right. This is a crystal puzzle. I know this one

1069
01:59:34,579 --> 01:59:37,710
Your son is watching

1070
01:59:37,789 --> 01:59:42,750
Is do you know this is a you had to click the yes, I mature audience filter it's on

1071
01:59:43,739 --> 01:59:48,770
You had to press that button

1072
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:52,960
Uh, am I doing I think i'm doing this right somehow accidentally

1073
01:59:58,050 --> 02:00:18,770
Let's do it. Um

1074
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:26,619
Solve this puzzle. You must freeze the objects in pairs of matching silhouettes causing them to become highlighted

1075
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:38,979
When all the objects are highlighted the lock will open in pairs of matching silhouettes feel like triangle triangle

1076
02:00:42,689 --> 02:00:56,989
diamond diamond

1077
02:00:56,989 --> 02:01:04,350
Uh, please need to stop watching it's been an issue for quite a while

1078
02:01:04,350 --> 02:01:07,869
We're aware of it, but you keep watching this sort of material on stream. I'm gonna have no choice

1079
02:01:07,869 --> 02:01:11,149
But to unsubscribe what what you what why am I watching this on stream?

1080
02:01:18,859 --> 02:01:20,699
All right, is it pac-man?

1081
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:36,189
No, it's not pac-man. What is it then circle you to match the silhouette. It's the shape

1082
02:01:36,909 --> 02:01:45,180
Yeah, okay. Hold on. Can I get a little tab in the middle there? Is that even I think this even does that

1083
02:01:46,829 --> 02:01:56,909
Moon little half moon. Not really. Oh, it's not just shape not color

1084
02:01:58,510 --> 02:02:00,510
Ah

1085
02:02:00,829 --> 02:02:10,289
Okay, i'm gonna find the star

1086
02:02:10,369 --> 02:02:25,390
Where's there a star or not a star maybe something else maybe a cube. I got this one right here. Check it out

1087
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,569
Yep. Oh, what about this cube?

1088
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:48,619
Oh, that's a star. It could also be a cube. It could also be a star. No, I can't

1089
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:59,149
No

1090
02:02:59,149 --> 02:03:01,149
Wait, that's the only one that's been matched so far

1091
02:03:01,949 --> 02:03:07,840
shit

1092
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,699
No

1093
02:03:10,699 --> 02:03:12,609
No, dude

1094
02:03:12,609 --> 02:03:24,720
I can't get it right. How is that not the same? It has to be the exact same thing

1095
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:34,939
Oh god same deal with this one. Okay

1096
02:03:36,699 --> 02:03:40,050
Whack and then

1097
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:49,840
Whack did I win? Oh, you don't have to you only have to do it for three of them. No, dude

1098
02:03:54,159 --> 02:04:03,569
Was that an alien talking or did they have to record somebody that was in the sound room and not the actor

1099
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:08,579
Because they needed something there. Yeah, that's what it was

1100
02:04:08,819 --> 02:04:12,500
I think maybe on these guys, uh planet one of the audio engineers had to do that

1101
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:24,180
About eating these aliens

1102
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:33,409
Have some respect why because they're dead this guy is a genuine asshole

1103
02:04:48,739 --> 02:04:52,899
We don't have a song

1104
02:04:53,539 --> 02:04:57,899
If there is a nav console and all this stuff we'd have to tear this place apart to find it

1105
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:00,380
Assuming we'll even know it when we see it

1106
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:03,899
I think we shouldn't take a look around. I think you should die dallas

1107
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,880
Let us know if you spot anything casey. I will

1108
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,210
Thanks for including me by the way

1109
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:15,899
I know you don't have to

1110
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:19,359
Well, unless you're having better luck than I am. I think we should keep going didn't even

1111
02:05:21,539 --> 02:05:30,060
I didn't get one second. That's all the time you're gonna give me here

1112
02:05:30,539 --> 02:05:35,220
I'll say one thing about those crin. He sure as hell do a thorough job

1113
02:05:35,619 --> 02:05:41,380
That room must have been I think we'll ever find any of these guys like a 10 by 10 cube. I sure hope so

1114
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:44,100
You know, it's times like this

1115
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:47,300
I wish I just stayed home and went to business school just like mama wanted

1116
02:05:47,939 --> 02:05:54,260
This looks the same in 160 that doesn't 1080. I'm sure it does. Well, it just so happens

1117
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:56,739
I have a pretty good head for figures. I can't add

1118
02:05:57,539 --> 02:06:00,020
Uh information for the bitrate to take

1119
02:06:05,859 --> 02:06:09,310
Puzzle door

1120
02:06:09,310 --> 02:06:11,310
All I can do is upscale this

1121
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:14,510
I can't add data to what's being presented

1122
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:21,789
orange red

1123
02:06:21,789 --> 02:06:23,789
green blue

1124
02:06:23,869 --> 02:06:27,520
Does this even count as a video game?

1125
02:06:28,829 --> 02:06:30,829
Well, I mean it depends

1126
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:33,279
Does the back of your cereal box?

1127
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:44,899
Consider itself to be a video game. I mean, it's a game

1128
02:06:45,539 --> 02:06:48,609
But I mean it is this is on video

1129
02:06:50,289 --> 02:06:53,090
So yes, it is technically let's take a look where this one is

1130
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,770
Okay

1131
02:06:58,770 --> 02:07:03,729
The objective is to route a colored light so that it reaches the flashing point of the same color

1132
02:07:04,590 --> 02:07:08,899
Okay, you can deflect the path of light by clicking in the cells

1133
02:07:10,369 --> 02:07:16,989
It is all right for the colors to mix at the position where they hit the flashing points from blue to blue

1134
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:24,819
That's not cheating. This is how it's what I've known what to do. Wait, what's this like goo? I'm putting on it

1135
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:34,079
Oh, no, that's a mirrors

1136
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:43,250
Oh, dear. These are mirrors. Oh fucking Jesus. This is gonna be hell. This is gonna be horrible

1137
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:53,550
Uh, take this off. It's gotta be here. These all get to get all these mirrors off

1138
02:07:54,109 --> 02:08:04,529
Take all these mirrors off. All right, we're gonna go this way take that mirror off. Get this one off this way

1139
02:08:05,250 --> 02:08:20,020
We're gonna bounce it from here to here get that mirror off. That one's done. Now. We need green green

1140
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:27,619
Where's green as a oh, okay green so green is gonna go

1141
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:38,739
Down here. We need to have a touch down here. No, how do I erase?

1142
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:51,390
Erase erase erase erase erase erase erase. Okay down and then right here. We're gonna bend it this way

1143
02:08:53,439 --> 02:09:09,619
I don't know. I don't know. Oh jesus. Okay. No, it's got wait odd watchers. Do your taxes

1144
02:09:13,069 --> 02:09:33,170
I mean you could if you wanted to this goes this way. We need to bounce it to here. There it is

1145
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:47,300
Okay, so that's that now. We just need red shit. Yeah

1146
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:53,409
We do it again red to red blue to blue

1147
02:09:55,020 --> 02:10:13,140
Uh blue is already blue is already there one so I have to hit green has to wait. What the hell's going on green is

1148
02:10:13,859 --> 02:10:21,899
Already there red and then red and then red and then red

1149
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:26,109
It red and then uh

1150

1161
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:26,930
Blue is blue blue's gotta go over here blue going up and no I don't want to do this one

1162
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:30,300
I don't want to do this one. I really don't want to do this one

1163
02:13:30,539 --> 02:13:48,340
I I have to you said you would finish the game of who said I was gonna stop playing the game

1164
02:13:50,109 --> 02:14:00,479
I was just gonna go to the walkthrough and wait the walkthrough is on easy like dallas encounter walkthrough medium

1165
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:15,659
All right. I'm almost there almost at the almost at the end of the game. All right, here we go

1166
02:14:15,899 --> 02:14:33,100
This is the one i'm on right now. I'm just gonna follow it word for word. Okay. Hold on. Hold on

1167
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:36,640
I'm just gonna follow word. Wait, this is not right blue green

1168
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:50,000
Right. This one's not right. Why is this different than mine blue on the left blue on the top?

1169
02:14:50,000 --> 02:15:07,039
This is different than mine. God fucking damn it. I I can't change the difficulty and I it's randomized

1170
02:15:11,149 --> 02:15:14,270
Why do you have to have to be randomized? All right, I have to that means I have to just do it

1171
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:26,819
That means I have to do it. Here we go step by step. That's one one is done green green is gonna go

1172
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:33,810
From here to here and then from here to here. Nope one more down one more down

1173
02:15:35,149 --> 02:15:44,220
Green is done. No, it's not now. It will be this is not good. Wait, hold on

1174
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:57,199
69 69 viewers watching. Okay

1175
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:02,399
That's kind of cool. I guess they have to I gotta go down here for this one, too

1176
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:06,560
Why did I make this medium? Why didn't I just put it on easy? Who cares?

1177
02:16:10,939 --> 02:16:21,359
It's my own damn fault. Oh Jesus. I i'm just gonna try

1178
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:31,060
It's gonna be really sloppy, but it might work green blue needs to go

1179
02:16:32,319 --> 02:16:38,979
Wait, why is this this is red now? What the fuck happened? That one's done. There's any there's another red right here

1180
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:51,569
Get rid of everything. We're doing red first. Okay green

1181
02:16:54,479 --> 02:17:05,409
There's only one green on the right so we go bounce bounce bounce done. Okay, red is done

1182
02:17:05,979 --> 02:17:28,430
There is no more red except for down here. Okay, red is done. It's now time to move on to green green

1183
02:17:28,829 --> 02:17:33,600
Where's the other green over here?

1184
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:54,579
Oh shit what how am I supposed to get that how am I supposed to get that one colors can mix at the ends

1185
02:17:55,940 --> 02:18:04,190
Uh, this has to be

1186
02:18:04,430 --> 02:18:11,600
Blue somehow need to go back to the fourth grade

1187
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:12,959
No

1188
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:17,840
This put this is fucking like difficult and annoying. All right, i'm not gonna sit here and take that

1189
02:18:18,479 --> 02:18:43,409
This is like an annoying shit puzzle blue blue. Oh, hold on almost there. I got it. I'm gonna get it right now ready

1190
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:52,530
Oh, hold on. Yes

1191
02:18:53,950 --> 02:19:08,139
Does that count does it count this is a mess. No, it doesn't I thought you said I could complete I could combine them

1192
02:19:21,219 --> 02:19:23,520
Such a fucking mess

1193
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:40,180
There has to be a medium walkthrough. Okay, but I found one. Oh, this is only the first 20 minutes of the game

1194
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:46,510
You can do this. I believe in you. I don't think I can I I think i'm too impatient to even spend 10 minutes on this

1195
02:19:47,139 --> 02:19:58,290
I can't do click map. See look at how many spaces there are. What did I what did I go wrong? I did

1196
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:05,059
I did I have no idea play something else. I'm almost on disc four. I can't all right

1197
02:20:05,059 --> 02:20:22,379
What if I can I change it to easy sunk cost?

1198
02:20:23,409 --> 02:20:25,409
It's like so stupid

1199
02:20:26,829 --> 02:20:27,790
Oh

1200
02:20:27,790 --> 02:20:29,790
I'm so pissed

1201
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:46,290
Get me out. What happened?

1202
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:48,370
Medium no, no

1203
02:20:55,170 --> 02:20:58,559
No

1204
02:20:58,559 --> 02:21:00,879
Jump to scene 24 on easy

1205
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:10,159
It's too mean

1206
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:11,760
Easy

1207
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:13,760
scene 24

1208
02:21:14,319 --> 02:21:18,270
Let's go

1209
02:21:18,270 --> 02:21:22,829
No, I don't want to change the game. I want to see what happens in the end. I'm i'm on disc of four

1210
02:21:23,309 --> 02:21:39,649
Wait, I still have to actually do this. It's supposed to be easy

1211
02:21:40,209 --> 02:22:01,379
Hold on. I think this person was playing on easy. Yeah, they were all right. This person was playing on easy

1212
02:22:01,379 --> 02:22:30,770
I got it. Okay, so then it goes like this. Okay, there's this blue blue blue blue blue blue red red

1213
02:22:31,540 --> 02:22:43,950
Green green red red like it's it's hard to even tell where the mirrors are because this thing is at like fucking 200p

1214
02:22:44,270 --> 02:23:00,719
We don't have to do anymore. We're done. That's it

1215
02:23:13,149 --> 02:23:17,790
Thing what what were you thinking about? I was deciding what to call the ship when I read it up in the log

1216
02:23:18,110 --> 02:23:20,270
Man, what's that? Hellhive crin motel?

1217
02:23:20,909 --> 02:23:22,909
Deadless what?

1218
02:23:22,909 --> 02:23:27,629
Ancient great mythology to escape from the labyrinth deadless made wings out of feathers and wax

1219
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:30,829
And then you fly too close to the sun and squirt his ass

1220
02:23:31,790 --> 02:23:33,790
Marlon brando

1221
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:38,959
It kind of is

1222
02:23:38,959 --> 02:23:41,250
Yeah, the dead listen kind of

1223
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:43,729
Hey to find a way out of here, i'ma leave

1224
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:51,979
In plant life, I guess

1225
02:23:52,059 --> 02:23:53,659
Yeah, but for what?

1226
02:23:53,659 --> 02:23:58,540
food supply oxygen supply frump and marlon brando are yes, they are one step away from each other

1227
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:05,680
Fogs

1228
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:15,620
It's like no don't shoot me she shot it around this thing maybe you can figure out a way to open it from the other side

1229
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:19,329
The hell was that with the gun pulling thing?

1230
02:24:19,569 --> 02:24:21,569
I'm sorry

1231
02:24:21,649 --> 02:24:23,649
Dude, she's sus

1232
02:24:27,459 --> 02:24:31,299
Don't you love on my stream when is he streaming command is not ruined forever

1233
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:54,670
That's supposed to be sense danger in sorcery. And now it's like hey i'm sus as to when he's streaming found something

1234
02:24:55,069 --> 02:25:00,559
Here comes a puzzle. I can't wait to do it very very quickly

1235
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:16,610
It's all an easy

1236
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:20,899
Me like what was it in in?

1237
02:25:21,139 --> 02:25:25,780
Well, isn't sus short for like suspect like you suspect somebody

1238
02:25:32,219 --> 02:25:35,489
Yeah, it's I mean in

1239
02:25:35,729 --> 02:25:42,479
Sorcery the spell was sense danger not like you are suspicious

1240
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:57,260
Sort of the same. It's a little it's a little the same not completely the same though

1241
02:26:04,799 --> 02:26:15,870
Um, how deep does this go at what point do I lose walkie talkie frequency?

1242
02:26:17,090 --> 02:26:23,860
Uh, look down should look down there's something down here. Oh, no, it's a maze

1243
02:26:25,579 --> 02:26:33,620
Of course it is

1244
02:26:33,620 --> 02:26:38,639
Okay. So now we're gonna go

1245
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:51,489
Maybe should I maybe analyze should I analyze the area analyze?

1246
02:26:52,290 --> 02:26:58,420
Data analyze thrusters. No, I just have to get it right

1247
02:26:58,979 --> 02:27:09,200
I just have to guess this is your colonoscopy. Yeah, pretty similar

1248
02:27:13,579 --> 02:27:27,780
Except it'd be kind of weird to have multiple ways to go in your intestines found it lucky there. Wait, I didn't really

1249
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:37,809
This is no good. This is no good

1250
02:27:40,129 --> 02:27:45,139
I got to start keeping track of where i've been but I have no idea where i've been every hallway is the same

1251
02:27:45,459 --> 02:27:54,940
Can't go up or down, right? I need a pen and paper

1252
02:27:55,500 --> 02:28:01,059
That's not a bad idea wall

1253
02:28:01,139 --> 02:28:24,959
All right, should I get out the pen and paper? I can't look up and I can't look down just use microsoft paint

1254
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:27,280
So what i'm back? Okay. Wait, wait, wait

1255
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:32,639
Okay, i'm gonna do paint. It's probably helpful. So that's a wall

1256
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:43,969
There's paint shit. It's on the monitor behind me. God damn it. I can't even click it

1257
02:28:43,969 --> 02:28:51,760
It's on the monitor behind me like behind the like i'm on a different source right now

1258
02:28:52,319 --> 02:28:58,000
Not behind me. I mean like behind the game. I'm on a different source about hdmi. I'm not on dvi because i'm capping it

1259
02:29:10,079 --> 02:29:12,079
Shh follow the right wall

1260
02:29:12,639 --> 02:29:16,079
I just tried to all right jeff. I'm gonna follow the right wall

1261
02:29:22,239 --> 02:29:26,379
Follow right wall. Okay, i'm going

1262
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:55,040
Wait wouldn't going right again put me in a circle. Okay, right again s video scaler hdmi. That's the one I have a retro tink

1263
02:29:55,819 --> 02:29:57,819
so it's s video into the retro tink and then

1264
02:29:58,540 --> 02:30:06,979
hdmi from the retro tink into an el gato and then el gato into the tv or the monitor i'm hugging the right wall

1265
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:12,180
By the way, the retro tink is incredible

1266
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:15,299
If you have an old console, it's the best one i've used so far

1267
02:30:17,969 --> 02:30:30,590
Without a doubt. I'm gonna try going this way the maze has pillars. You're fucked with the right wall

1268
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:48,049
I didn't how does it even end up there? I'd rather watch you clean the bathroom than this

1269
02:30:50,530 --> 02:30:53,889
Just wait a minute. I'm i'm interested. I need to play

1270
02:30:54,690 --> 02:30:58,370
This game sucks. All right, I know you don't think I know I need i'm

1271
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:02,420
I'm enjoying it. I'm wonderful. I gotta get to disc four

1272
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:11,889
I can't just not see disc four. Otherwise, that's so bad for me. All right. Hold on. Does this guy have the walkthrough of this?

1273
02:31:12,450 --> 02:31:32,819
Where is it? Come on. Show me. All right. Here he is. Okay, so he goes

1274
02:31:34,209 --> 02:31:37,409
straight

1275
02:31:37,409 --> 02:31:45,059
Straight, how would you even figure this out straight right ends up going down somehow actually physically down

1276
02:31:45,219 --> 02:31:57,489
How much of this game add to the germ of debt take no. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. I went down

1277
02:31:57,489 --> 02:32:02,319
I went down. I went down. I just went down. So wait when he goes down

1278
02:32:02,399 --> 02:32:07,889
I want to see what he did what happens. I want to get to the point where he goes down

1279
02:32:10,180 --> 02:32:13,100
Okay, he just went down now. Where does he go?

1280
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:29,709
Every resident sleeper removes the debt by five million. Okay, and he goes left. Okay. He goes left and then

1281
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:35,100
After he goes left he goes

1282
02:32:37,329 --> 02:32:42,219
Straight he goes after going straight

1283
02:32:43,489 --> 02:32:49,100
Imagine being 12 and trying to do this on your own. Okay after going straight he goes

1284
02:32:49,819 --> 02:32:59,010
Straight again, and then it's a dead end for me. It's

1285
02:33:00,190 --> 02:33:14,530
Not a dead end for him. Why?

1286
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:18,379
No

1287
02:33:18,379 --> 02:33:23,180
What the wait dead end behind me dead end to the left?

1288
02:33:24,989 --> 02:33:30,590
So I can go straight then so right is a dead end behind me to dead end this left this way right straight ahead

1289
02:33:30,989 --> 02:33:43,729
Straight ahead. This is it. This has to be it forward. Come on. Come on. Okay, so

1290
02:33:45,299 --> 02:33:46,579
No, what?

1291
02:33:46,579 --> 02:33:53,469
Where do I go?

1292
02:33:55,620 --> 02:33:57,620
Left or right

1293
02:33:57,620 --> 02:34:13,489
Left try right. Okay. I'll try right. Oh my god

1294
02:34:14,450 --> 02:34:20,049
Okay, so then if we go straight straight would have been left so we're gonna go straight or right right

1295
02:34:20,049 --> 02:34:21,729
We're gonna go right from here

1296
02:34:21,729 --> 02:34:26,590
Right. No, we're gonna left. I don't know straight right from here

1297
02:34:27,069 --> 02:34:31,569
It's straight from when we first came down straight from here is left when we first came down

1298
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:49,180
Yeah, let's go right. No, I was wrong. That was wrong. Go back back back. Go back that way. That was wrong

1299
02:34:49,500 --> 02:35:01,649
So now we're gonna go left. Well, this is not even the right. This is not even correct

1300
02:35:02,129 --> 02:35:29,780
This wasn't underneath this before what I was just here. Okay, we're like from here straight

1301
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:52,829
That was the worst noise. No, it was me clearing my I don't know left

1302
02:35:53,389 --> 02:35:59,889
Left from here. I'm gonna get a fucking t-shirt for completing this game

1303
02:36:01,469 --> 02:36:14,430
That's dead end man. You got that wrong. Not left. Your brain is made for bug snacks

1304
02:36:14,430 --> 02:36:28,750
Okay, we're playing bug snacks tomorrow when he said left again, dude. This is

1305
02:36:29,469 --> 02:36:31,469
How is this

1306
02:36:32,190 --> 02:36:36,450
Even like 30 years ago, how why is this fun? I understand like little puzzles

1307
02:36:37,459 --> 02:36:43,620
But the like guess which way you're going maze first person thing like this not like this. Not even fun

1308
02:36:44,180 --> 02:37:01,780
How many people gave up at this maze? I even followed the walkthrough and it wasn't even right

1309
02:37:09,579 --> 02:37:12,540
You made us do three mazes. Yeah, but that was different though

1310
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:16,379
Because there was like a thousand of there was like 500 of you that could find it

1311
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:28,180
It's only one of me here if 500 other people were doing this somebody would find it, okay now

1312
02:37:28,819 --> 02:37:42,379
We get out of here

1313
02:37:42,700 --> 02:37:45,819
Get us out of here, but not yet. Hold on. I gotta get to that fourth disc

1314
02:37:46,219 --> 02:37:50,219
We're like fucking 20 minutes away from the end of the goddamn game. I want to see it so bad

1315
02:37:50,219 --> 02:37:53,260
Don't you know none of you do but I know you might you maybe you do

1316
02:37:54,540 --> 02:38:03,149
This is a screensaver once if we go down then we're on the right track

1317
02:38:03,709 --> 02:38:15,579
That's not down. Fuck watch it on youtube. I did and I followed the exact instructions

1318
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:23,260
Stop turning. I just went straight twice

1319
02:38:23,739 --> 02:38:26,110
I just went straight twice

1320
02:38:39,819 --> 02:38:42,139
Go to the menu and start the maze with the walkthrough

1321
02:38:48,879 --> 02:38:51,200
Okay, I will I will but one second. Hold on

1322
02:38:53,139 --> 02:39:03,520
The game fax has a full map. It does

1323
02:39:05,899 --> 02:39:07,500
walkthrough

1324
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:09,340
by anonymous

1325
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:15,790
Okay. Yes. Okay. All right. All right. Where is it green? Okay click

1326
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:24,909
Next time into the hole and click the floodlight. This is the maze. Okay. Holy shit. This thing sucks

1327
02:39:24,989 --> 02:39:26,989
Are you kidding me? This is horrible

1328
02:39:27,149 --> 02:39:33,739
Okay, so where where do you start?

1329
02:39:37,870 --> 02:39:41,790
Hold on again

1330
02:39:41,790 --> 02:39:43,790
Okay, I can't paste it in here

1331
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:55,709
Joe on screen. Hold on a second. Can I do it in a text box?

1332
02:39:55,790 --> 02:40:02,930
That would be actually pretty funny if I could hold on. I hope I can yeah, I can this is so funny

1333
02:40:06,559 --> 02:40:08,559
There you go. Here's the here's the maze

1334
02:40:10,059 --> 02:40:12,059
That's why that's what I have to look at

1335
02:40:12,059 --> 02:40:26,209
Hold on. No, it's not quite correct the spacing, right?

1336
02:40:30,930 --> 02:40:48,370
Wrong font. What font is this? What the fuck is this? This is the map that's on the game fax

1337
02:40:49,010 --> 02:41:02,100
This is him, right? No, the spacing's wrong. The spacing's wrong. Hold on. Let me just take a screenshot of this

1338
02:41:04,049 --> 02:41:06,049
Hold on. Wait a sec

1339
02:41:07,739 --> 02:41:11,420
I gotta check. You know what? I'm gonna take a piss. I'll be right back and i'm gonna get this on screen

1340
02:41:11,420 --> 02:41:13,420
I'll be right back pee time go pee

1341
02:43:29,149 --> 02:43:31,149
Okay, i'm back and i'm ready

1342
02:43:31,870 --> 02:43:40,899
I'm back and i'm ready at the map. I'm ready to rock and roll

1343
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:44,180
This is what it's supposed to look like not like that

1344
02:43:45,299 --> 02:43:51,680
It's supposed to look like this

1345
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,840
So I have to i'm gonna restart the chapter

1346
02:43:54,479 --> 02:43:58,590
What is farm?

1347
02:43:58,590 --> 02:44:02,719
That's even worse. This is the maze

1348
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:12,110
There's a map of the maze

1349
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:15,620
Okay

1350
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:17,620
What do you where do you start?

1351
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:25,979
This doesn't make any sense. Um, no, I don't think it does but maybe it might

1352
02:44:26,459 --> 02:44:31,700
What do you mean who made this? Somebody like 20 years ago. Thank god they did

1353
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:35,459
Otherwise, we'd be here forever and i'd have to turn the video. I'd have to turn it off and I don't want to turn it off

1354
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:37,219
All right, let's go

1355
02:44:37,219 --> 02:44:40,370
Thank god. They did

1356
02:44:40,370 --> 02:44:49,139
Okay, so let's restart go to the menu

1357
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:51,780
And restart and what is farm?

1358
02:44:56,930 --> 02:44:58,930
Taking ascii is true dedication

1359
02:45:00,559 --> 02:45:02,719
And this is scene 26. That's what we want. Let's go

1360
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:07,889
All right

1361
02:45:07,889 --> 02:45:09,979
so where

1362
02:45:09,979 --> 02:45:11,979
This is where are we now farm?

1363
02:45:14,940 --> 02:45:22,430
This has to be farm, right?

1364
02:45:22,430 --> 02:45:23,809
All right, we're in

1365
02:45:23,809 --> 02:45:25,569
Turn on the flood light

1366
02:45:25,569 --> 02:45:26,530
Here we are

1367
02:45:26,530 --> 02:45:27,569
Okay

1368
02:45:27,569 --> 02:45:39,440
So if we go straight we can only go straight the straight puts us if that's cube

1369
02:45:41,180 --> 02:45:43,979
Where are we trying to go?

1370
02:45:43,979 --> 02:45:46,459
I have no idea. I yeah, where does this go?

1371
02:45:47,180 --> 02:45:49,260
bottom right

1372
02:45:49,260 --> 02:45:51,549
Okay, straight

1373
02:45:51,549 --> 02:45:53,389
Then right right?

1374
02:45:53,389 --> 02:45:59,680
We're trying to go to the corridor. We need to go straight all the way and then left so we have to go straight again

1375
02:46:00,239 --> 02:46:04,559
And then straight again and then straight again

1376
02:46:08,459 --> 02:46:15,709
No, what right now we are on cube. I don't know where we are. We're on. No, I know I know

1377
02:46:16,430 --> 02:46:19,629
Right now we are cube two above farm straight up

1378
02:46:20,670 --> 02:46:24,350
so if we go

1379
02:46:24,350 --> 02:46:28,379
Up we go straight again then left and then straight

1380
02:46:33,139 --> 02:46:36,180
Straight again puts us to the third square above farm

1381
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:45,020
This is where we're in square three above farm

1382
02:46:45,739 --> 02:46:47,620
We're going to go left

1383
02:46:47,620 --> 02:47:00,079
Left will take us to that next one here. I need to be like marking this. I don't think I can though

1384
02:47:02,180 --> 02:47:05,219
Now we are on the one right before the long hallway up top

1385
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:12,319
And now but wait, hold on. Does this is this direction? Does this take into account direction you're facing?

1386
02:47:12,959 --> 02:47:16,059
So is this technically straight on this one or is that left?

1387
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:23,010
No, it's straight, right?

1388
02:47:23,010 --> 02:47:25,649
Straight takes us across the pond, correct?

1389
02:47:26,209 --> 02:47:35,010
We're gonna go across the pond here. We're gonna go across and around and down and through and that's not right

1390
02:47:37,649 --> 02:47:47,819
What I don't know where I am. Okay. Now I'm I don't know the way i'm facing started over

1391
02:47:47,819 --> 02:47:50,219
I don't know which way i'm facing. I don't know idea

1392
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:56,760
Okay, so the idea is you go straight and then left immediately

1393
02:47:57,299 --> 02:48:03,629
That's why we were walking in circles guys because look at the look at the four cubes that are above farm

1394
02:48:04,479 --> 02:48:06,479
How are you ever supposed to figure that out?

1395
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:17,260
Okay, here we go. I am going to go

1396
02:48:18,610 --> 02:48:20,079
left

1397
02:48:20,079 --> 02:48:33,139
Immediately that puts us right here. We're gonna go straight straight here

1398
02:48:33,620 --> 02:48:40,100
That should take us across but that the line on the left

1399
02:48:41,299 --> 02:48:47,649
No, all right. We're going here we go. We're going down. Okay, we've made it now. I need to go

1400
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:56,159
Um, I don't I don't understand if if if positional direction is it makes any sense straight again

1401
02:48:56,719 --> 02:49:02,510
No, it would have to be right because that's we came in that way, right? It would have to be right

1402
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:07,840
And then we go straight

1403
02:49:12,340 --> 02:49:14,340
Okay, so now straight

1404
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:23,200
Not right into the trash then we go straight again

1405
02:49:26,559 --> 02:49:32,000
Look at the chutes and ladders bullshit if up here if I take a right it takes me all the way back down

1406
02:49:32,479 --> 02:49:53,840
Straight again and then right and we go right. Okay, I forget I forget where we are

1407
02:49:55,389 --> 02:49:57,790
No, okay when we go I forget I don't know where I am. Can we go right?

1408
02:49:57,790 --> 02:49:59,389
I don't I have no idea where I am

1409
02:49:59,389 --> 02:50:05,149
We go right which puts us to the one right before the the the candy cane touches the top of it, right?

1410
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:11,200
Right and then we bang a left

1411
02:50:13,940 --> 02:50:15,940
And then that should be into the top of the candy cane

1412
02:50:19,020 --> 02:50:28,719
The left should go into the candy cane and then we go down through the candy cane

1413
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:32,719
And we end up right next to the corridor

1414
02:50:39,440 --> 02:50:41,120
Now we go

1415
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:43,549
That's not right

1416
02:50:43,549 --> 02:50:46,430
Oh, I don't know. I don't know straight. I think it's straight from here now, right?

1417
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:51,540
It's going don't say right if if you're agreeing with me say yes

1418
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:54,659
Straight is the correct way now, right?

1419
02:50:55,379 --> 02:50:58,899
No, don't say right straight is the correct right way. Yes

1420
02:51:00,510 --> 02:51:03,790
No, don't say right straight is the correct way. Yes

1421
02:51:04,430 --> 02:51:12,639
No, are you saying are you saying right lesson to go right? I don't know where I don't know which way i'm facing on this map

1422
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:17,389
Okay, so if I go straight here, I don't know. I have no idea where I am

1423
02:51:17,950 --> 02:51:20,450
If I go right i'm gonna end up

1424
02:51:20,530 --> 02:51:22,530
Stupid go straight

1425
02:51:23,540 --> 02:51:26,719
straight will

1426
02:51:26,719 --> 02:51:28,159
um

1427
02:51:28,159 --> 02:51:35,629
No, it's not straight. Is it it's straight it is and then now we bang a left

1428
02:51:36,770 --> 02:51:41,889
We go left from here

1429
02:51:41,889 --> 02:51:49,090
Right and now left

1430
02:51:49,090 --> 02:51:55,459
And then straight and that will take us through the corridor

1431
02:51:57,540 --> 02:51:59,229
So technically

1432
02:51:59,229 --> 02:52:01,229
We are okay now straight

1433
02:52:04,879 --> 02:52:12,430
Straight this is it

1434
02:52:12,430 --> 02:52:17,229
Yes

1435
02:52:17,229 --> 02:52:24,770
Wow, that was awful. That was terrible

1436
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:38,340
Screen so messed up. What the fuck? All right case you did it

1437
02:52:41,389 --> 02:52:43,389
They keep saying I love you

1438
02:52:43,389 --> 02:52:49,870
Does another dead end come on zack we've been in bad before remember that time on tacos 7 when we were pinned down by

1439
02:52:49,870 --> 02:52:51,870
Two back our squads

1440
02:52:59,069 --> 02:53:05,469
Insert disc four such thing as a hopeless situation rigs the engine to create a plasma burst and boom took them all out

1441
02:53:06,190 --> 02:53:11,010
Yeah, all right. Maybe you're right turn off r9k. All right, this is got to be close

1442
02:53:11,569 --> 02:53:13,280
What's this one?

1443
02:53:13,280 --> 02:53:19,809
Open this door

1444
02:53:19,809 --> 02:53:21,489
All right, this one

1445
02:53:21,489 --> 02:53:24,770
Yep, I knew it. We're so we're getting to the end. We're so close

1446
02:53:24,770 --> 02:53:28,770
I'm so glad i'm gonna be i'm gonna be the only person on twitch to have ever completed the died alice encounter

1447
02:53:30,590 --> 02:53:34,270
No one else has beat this game on stream and I will put any amount of money on that like

1448
02:53:34,510 --> 02:53:36,590
But i'm not gonna bet any money because it could be wrong

1449
02:53:37,229 --> 02:53:41,200
This is not a bet. This is me. Just stating a statement that could be real

1450
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:53,409
It's four going on

1451
02:53:53,409 --> 02:54:03,459
Let's go disc four

1452
02:54:04,530 --> 02:54:05,950
Yes

1453
02:54:05,950 --> 02:54:08,450
Why am I so excited about this?

1454
02:54:08,450 --> 02:54:10,450
This is called the purple door

1455
02:54:10,690 --> 02:54:13,569
Clicking on one of the black lines causes it to turn blue

1456
02:54:14,209 --> 02:54:19,920
The lock responds by turning one of the red lines red. Um, you know what just give me the walkthrough. I don't care

1457
02:54:20,479 --> 02:54:31,040
Okay, uh

1458
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:33,760
Like uh, this is really this is a really a game

1459
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:41,010
You must form a closed path of four or longer before the computer does it's very difficult. What did I spoil the game?

1516
03:03:39,649 --> 03:03:50,829
No one's going anywhere. I kind of don't understand what this wants me to do though

1517
03:03:51,629 --> 03:04:05,489
All right. Um now what data I have like all these pictures in my data

03:04:33,500 --> 03:04:35,500
Nobody else just us

1523
03:04:35,659 --> 03:04:58,270
Okay, that was orange. That's it. There's only two pictures per panel. I think that's it. Oh, there's one more panel here

1524
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:16,690
Oh another panel. You can't even say hello to his only viewer. I'll be honest with you

1525
03:05:16,690 --> 03:05:25,100
I don't remember what their name was. Okay, what's the walkthrough say?

1526
03:05:26,209 --> 03:05:27,809
Each panel will show you two pictures

1527
03:05:27,809 --> 03:05:34,129
You have to click various colors to make the pictures appear click analyze on each picture and translate each using the numeric code

1528
03:05:34,209 --> 03:05:36,209
We've been using with the doors

1529
03:05:36,290 --> 03:05:42,479
What do you mean translate?

1530
03:05:49,809 --> 03:05:50,370

No, I don't want to why do you hate us so much? I don't am I gonna play something else?

1534
03:06:24,530 --> 03:06:26,690
Yeah, once I get to the end of this we're putting in blade force

1535
03:06:27,090 --> 03:06:36,829
Take a round for that one. Uh, I don't even I don't understand. Okay. I'm just telling you guys right now

1536
03:06:36,909 --> 03:06:41,149
Uh right after this next sentence in the walkthrough. I see the words finale

1537
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:44,299
so

1538
03:06:44,299 --> 03:06:47,840
We just have to uh, literally watch the video of how the person doing this

1539
03:06:58,129 --> 03:07:06,850
Yeah, well the finale is right after this whatever it is. All right. What the fuck does this even want me to do?

1540
03:07:12,100 --> 03:07:18,780
All right, so you go you you go to each panel you scan each picture and then I think I leave

1541
03:07:19,420 --> 03:07:25,469
How do I just leave? How do I get away? I can't leave

1542
03:07:28,399 --> 03:07:45,090
Leave how do I fucking leave? What is this game called? Actually? It's called the die dallas encounter

1543
03:07:48,079 --> 03:07:49,280
I got them all

1544
03:07:49,280 --> 03:07:53,489
This is horrible. Yes. I know this game is

1545
03:07:54,030 --> 03:07:58,930
Absolute utter dog shit. I know but i'm at disc four and i'm gonna i'm gonna win

1546
03:07:59,489 --> 03:08:16,379
Is there one that I didn't scan? Did I not scan this one? Did you get it?

1547
03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:26,399
At this this just

1548
03:08:26,399 --> 03:08:28,399
This no like what?

1549
03:08:28,879 --> 03:08:31,360

1550
03:08:38,700 --> 03:08:41,159
How like what?

1551
03:08:41,159 --> 03:08:42,379

1552
03:08:42,379 --> 03:08:51,569
What do you mean translate? What am I supposed to be translating?

1553
03:08:56,510 --> 03:08:57,709
I wish I could just

1554
03:08:57,709 --> 03:09:05,069
Fucking get a save state and skip this because this is this is just why would you ever know what to do here?

1555
03:09:05,469 --> 03:09:10,479
This is stupid

1556
03:09:10,479 --> 03:09:12,879
On their video that this is easy too

1557
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:21,329
And they have like a weird interface I don't have like a pc interface data. How do I like even do this?

1558
03:09:23,250 --> 03:09:24,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1559
03:09:24,850 --> 03:09:32,690
Okay, green blue yellow. Yeah, sure. What the fuck do you want me to do?

1560
03:09:33,250 --> 03:10:00,049
Huh grandpa hit the enter key

1561
03:10:01,969 --> 03:10:06,030
If we scan this one

1562
03:10:06,030 --> 03:10:09,069
Maybe you have to scan them all. I don't remember the guy leaning over the sphere

1563
03:10:10,030 --> 03:10:12,979
German this is painful unplug it

1564
03:10:17,149 --> 03:10:18,290
Yeah

1565
03:10:18,290 --> 03:10:30,479
Symbol pull the plug pull the plug. Is it weird that I I I can't because I have to spite finish this game

1566
03:10:30,879 --> 03:10:33,379
I definitely didn't see this one

1567
03:10:33,379 --> 03:10:42,079
Okay. Now I got that I got it

1568
03:10:45,520 --> 03:10:47,520
sunk cost

1569
03:10:47,520 --> 03:11:06,739
Well, it's not sunk cost if you eventually get to the end somewhere somewhere in the world that somebody really embarrassed this game exists

1570
03:11:08,719 --> 03:11:12,079
Like they they like fucking designed and programmed this game shit faced every day

1571
03:11:12,479 --> 03:11:28,930
They probably don't even remember that they made this they hotboxed the office

1572
03:11:29,889 --> 03:11:36,379
I can't dude. This doesn't even make any fucking sense

1573
03:11:39,010 --> 03:11:41,010
Even the walkthrough doesn't make any sense

1574
03:11:43,889 --> 03:11:48,370
Patterns saved. Yeah, I mean, I know I have like these patterns in this but what am I supposed to do with them?

1575
03:11:49,170 --> 03:12:11,219
I can't even leave the slabs enhance it. I have like I have this data ship, but I can't even interact with it

1576
03:12:16,989 --> 03:12:21,389
All right. I'm getting close. I'm getting close to ripping it out. You're right. I'm getting really close. Is it gonna happen?

1577
03:12:21,950 --> 03:12:30,319
I'm getting close to ripping it out

1578
03:12:30,399 --> 03:12:37,280
But we're at we're on the last fucking disc i'm so close to ripping it out and just frisbee-ing it

1579
03:12:40,209 --> 03:12:42,209
What the fuck is this?

1580
03:12:42,209 --> 03:12:52,379
Okay, hold on. This is where he is in the story

1581
03:12:58,590 --> 03:13:00,350
And then he moves to the left

1582
03:13:00,350 --> 03:13:13,409
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I think I got it. I think it's over. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. This is where he is

1583
03:13:20,530 --> 03:13:34,979
He scanned I did I scan this one. This is all we're almost done. Check this shit out. Here we go

1584
03:13:35,299 --> 03:14:01,170
I've got it. I've got that one scan. I'm gonna scan one more scan this one. That's it. That's it. That's it

1585
03:14:07,809 --> 03:14:10,129
I fucking scared. I scared these already

1586
03:14:14,379 --> 03:14:17,739
What does he do?

1587
03:14:17,739 --> 03:14:26,219
Translation wait, he's doing the same thing. I'm doing he's just going around in circles for like 15 straight minutes

1588
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:29,229
He leaves how do I leave?

1589
03:14:30,559 --> 03:14:34,370
How do I leave?

1590
03:14:34,370 --> 03:14:39,329
How the fuck do I leave he he clicks down with a mouse and clicks the bottom of the screen and leaves

1591
03:14:39,969 --> 03:14:49,700
I can't do that. How do I leave?

1592
03:14:49,780 --> 03:14:56,739
He has like a I can leave button. How do I fucking leave?

1593
03:14:58,110 --> 03:15:02,670

1594
03:15:02,750 --> 03:15:06,700
Please let me leave

1595
03:15:06,700 --> 03:15:08,219
What the fuck?

1596
03:15:08,219 --> 03:15:13,260
Why would I finish stuff like this and not resident evil 2?

1597
03:15:13,979 --> 03:15:20,399
I did resident evil 2 on my own plus this is resident evil 2 is like a nine hour game

1598
03:15:20,399 --> 03:15:22,079
This is like three and a half hours

1599
03:15:22,079 --> 03:15:29,180
Okay, how do I physically get the fuck out of this fucking? I'm so mad right now. How do I no

1600
03:15:32,930 --> 03:15:34,930
You don't have the achievements for clear. Shut up

1601
03:15:35,870 --> 03:15:43,299
No, that didn't just happen. Did it god?

1602
03:15:43,940 --> 03:15:46,979
Why can't I just back up from the fucking podium?

1603
03:15:47,950 --> 03:15:49,950
Did they forget to program it into the 3DO?

1604
03:15:57,860 --> 03:16:02,040
I don't think I think they forgot to program that into the 3DO version of the game

1605
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:08,360
I'm not even going to go over here. I'm not going to click on any of this shit

1606
03:16:13,659 --> 03:16:16,739
No, no, no, no, shut up

1607
03:16:16,739 --> 03:16:20,500
No, I refuse

1608
03:16:20,500 --> 03:16:23,219
Okay, I did it. I'm done. That was fun. Now get me out

1609
03:16:23,540 --> 03:16:44,510
Oh

1610
03:16:45,389 --> 03:16:47,389
I'm so mad

1611
03:16:47,469 --> 03:16:49,469
I feel like I have to quit this

1612
03:16:50,750 --> 03:16:51,850
fucking

1613
03:16:51,850 --> 03:16:58,889
Trash can of a video game

1614
03:17:00,110 --> 03:17:08,129
Just wait, hold on. Good job casey

1615
03:17:08,770 --> 03:17:15,389

1687
03:26:33,090 --> 03:26:55,120
Hold on a minute. Why does nobody want to show me this? I don't care if i'm here all day

1688
03:26:55,120 --> 03:27:01,549
I need to figure out why this is happening with this. We're at the end of the fucking game

1689
03:27:02,110 --> 03:27:18,559
Although his video says this is disc four of five. Wait, what? I don't have a fifth disc. Okay. Here we go

1694
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:15,309
He scans this and then then possible data language and then it skips again

1695
03:28:15,469 --> 03:28:33,620
And then it skips again in and way out of this puzzle. It's like this shit

1696

03:32:17,020 --> 03:32:19,329
You weren't the first to beat this

1738
03:34:19,520 --> 03:34:23,299

Okay, so just match the color of whatever is on the screen if this is wrong

1747
03:35:30,459 --> 03:35:33,340
And it's your fault if we have to watch her go across the balance beam again

All right. So what happens?

1764

1812
03:43:29,340 --> 03:43:41,219
Okay, I put it on medium. No, it doesn't matter

1813
03:43:42,579 --> 03:43:46,780

1815
03:43:53,870 --> 03:44:01,420
What do you mean scan the fucking purple door? What are you talking about? Go to the previous scene?

1834
03:45:58,700 --> 03:46:00,860
I can't believe I fucking softlock myself

1835
03:46:05,969 --> 03:46:08,450

03:53:49,170 --> 03:54:01,280
This is like the stone age of making video games. They were hitting they were they were bashing their computers with fucking stone tools

1907
03:54:01,600 --> 03:54:04,030
That's how old and shitty this is

1908
03:54:14,100 --> 03:54:16,100
Go into the maze and turn on the floodlight

1909
03:54:17,489 --> 03:54:20,450
This is so much easier than a fucking map

1910

03:58:00,780 --> 03:58:02,780
It's some kind of alien language

1940
03:58:04,590 --> 03:58:06,350
And there it is

1941
03:58:06,350 --> 03:58:08,350

03:58:26,860 --> 03:58:29,360
It's time to end this

1944
03:58:29,360 --> 03:58:30,639
it's time

1945
03:58:30,639 --> 03:58:34,270
for this end

1946
03:58:34,590 --> 03:58:51,139
I think I just put in just two

1947
03:58:51,139 --> 03:58:55,620
Thank god. Okay. Now I know what to do. I've got everything settled and ready to go

My feet are starting to hurt airy. How did they put in moving walkways?

1956
04:00:13,569 --> 04:00:18,129
Tell me zack. Do you complain just to make conversation or do you honestly enjoy it?

1957
04:00:18,770 --> 04:00:24,850
Geez airy, my dogs are aching. Okay. Have you no sympathy? I'm saving my sympathy for you when you'll really need it

1958
04:00:25,649 --> 04:00:29,809
When you run out of things to scan that that one and then we're good casey

1959
04:00:30,450 --> 04:00:35,329
See if you can figure out what these panels are for. I will I will yes. Yes me me me me me me pick me

1960
04:00:36,209 --> 04:00:40,209
Pick me pick me pick me pick me me pick me

Pick me pick me pick me pick me. All right, uh

1962
04:00:45,659 --> 04:00:46,540
Oh

1963
04:00:46,540 --> 04:00:53,389
Do I have everything scanned? I think I already have all this shit. Yeah, I think I already have all this stuff

1964
04:00:53,389 --> 04:01:02,670
Don't I it was the important one right here, right? Yeah, I have I already have it all

1965
04:01:03,229 --> 04:01:18,940
Just go left three times

1966
04:01:18,940 --> 04:01:20,620
Shit, okay. Hold on

1967
04:01:20,620 --> 04:01:42,850
I already scanned these though. I've already scanned these I have to do it all I have to scan them all again

1968
04:01:42,850 --> 04:01:44,770
But it's they're already in my database

1969
04:01:44,770 --> 04:01:58,190
Praise yeah, the shit's all in the database already just activate them

1970
04:01:58,190 --> 04:02:06,739
Yeah, I just I think I just have to have seen them and then we can finally move on to the end of the game

1971
04:02:07,139 --> 04:02:20,510
But okay, we've seen it seen these

1972
04:02:20,829 --> 04:02:24,899
I don't have disk five

1973
04:02:24,899 --> 04:02:41,700
That doesn't exist and it yell at that person everyone yell at that person. Okay, good. We got that one now

1974
04:02:42,420 --> 04:02:55,920
Look at this one. All right. What are you doing? Everybody yell. All right, there it is

1975
04:02:56,479 --> 04:02:58,049
All right, we're good

1976
04:02:58,049 --> 04:03:13,360
Okay, see if you can figure out what's going on here. Okay, what look they're starting to read

1977
04:03:15,010 --> 04:03:18,559
Stop reading don't read in my face ever again

1978
04:03:27,760 --> 04:03:37,379
Okay scan this one. Thank you scan scan scan scan if we go left then we go left then we go left and it's over

1979
04:03:44,610 --> 04:03:57,969
Wait, I have to look at these

1980
04:03:57,969 --> 04:04:02,819
Okay, we're done. That's it

1981
04:04:02,819 --> 04:04:17,409
left left left left left left left left

1982
04:04:27,979 --> 04:04:41,409
The mca what what happened? He's already scanned. I already scanned them all. They're already in my database

1983
04:04:41,729 --> 04:05:01,729
You have to left. Okay, i'm gonna do exactly what I did last time

1984
04:05:02,450 --> 04:05:19,780
I scanned that one and then I just went left three times. This has been quite a journey. He's still here

1985
04:05:19,940 --> 04:05:22,420
No, um, this game sucks asshole

1986
04:05:23,059 --> 04:05:27,459
So if you do not do a very specific thing of sequences you cannot finish the game

1987
04:05:27,940 --> 04:05:30,819
So let's just get that really clear for that person that just showed up

1988
04:05:37,200 --> 04:05:39,200
Where's the one that I have to do exactly?

1989
04:05:40,770 --> 04:05:44,049
Game sucks. Gotta finish it. Well now it's kind of like remember um, remember clock tower

1990
04:05:44,690 --> 04:05:46,129
and we got like

1991
04:05:46,129 --> 04:05:49,329
Two-thirds of the way through clock tower and I was like, I hate this but I was like, oh, this is kind of fun

1992
04:05:49,329 --> 04:06:03,409
At the same time though. So I've had I had to finish it. Where is that stupid panel?

1993
04:06:03,889 --> 04:06:08,049
With the symbol that I have to scan this and then go left three times

1994
04:06:10,690 --> 04:06:26,030
You're having fun yet. Okay. Here we go. Ready scan this and then move left three times. That's what I did last time

1995
04:06:26,829 --> 04:06:40,879
Here patterns say left left left left

1996
04:06:41,200 --> 04:07:00,829
You didn't scan the blank object this all these things have already been scanned. I'm like replaying it

1997
04:07:01,149 --> 04:07:05,860
What's wrong with the mic quality? Oh, apparently things fucked up. I guess

1998
04:07:10,079 --> 04:07:16,020
Okay, so last time I did this I went left three times and then it just went to the cutscene

1999
04:07:16,819 --> 04:07:23,790
Now I did left three times and didn't do anything. I just went left twice or three like

2000
04:07:26,540 --> 04:07:31,090
Don't go into the menu

2001
04:07:31,329 --> 04:07:34,139
What do you mean go to the menu?

2002
04:07:36,110 --> 04:07:37,709
Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second

2003
04:07:37,709 --> 04:07:42,909
Are you telling me that you think that I now that I have this in the in the computer system that I can just skip

2004
04:07:42,909 --> 04:07:47,889
To the next scene

2005
04:07:47,889 --> 04:07:50,739
Wait a minute

2006
04:07:50,739 --> 04:07:53,399
Oh shit, I think we may have just found a loophole

2007
04:08:11,500 --> 04:08:16,059
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go you guys fucking how you just pumped

2008
04:08:16,700 --> 04:08:44,610
Purple, what was that demon noise? Somebody's my mic was messed up

2009
04:08:45,250 --> 04:08:56,059
It sucks fucking get out of this game. Um, we will

2010
04:08:56,700 --> 04:08:59,299
We're so close to the end

2011
04:08:59,299 --> 04:09:01,299
Worst noise from the worst stream

2012
04:09:01,299 --> 04:09:06,819
That's not even accurate. Can't you guys not you can't just say every stream is the worst screen

2013
04:09:07,540 --> 04:09:10,280
It's not how that works. You're all in big trouble

2014
04:09:27,180 --> 04:09:29,180
This one actually is omega low

2015
04:09:34,340 --> 04:09:36,340
All right, here we go

2016
04:09:37,379 --> 04:09:39,440
Thank you

2017
04:09:39,440 --> 04:09:40,959
I did it

2018
04:09:40,959 --> 04:09:48,030
Let's see the end

2019
04:09:48,030 --> 04:09:52,799
Quick. Well, i'm taking her gun and putting it in a bag

2020
04:09:55,819 --> 04:09:57,819
They're gonna fall out of that bag

2021
04:09:58,530 --> 04:10:00,530
That's what happens when you put the milk

2022
04:10:02,459 --> 04:10:03,500
and like

2023
04:10:03,500 --> 04:10:05,700
Oh

2024
04:10:05,700 --> 04:10:09,540
That's a bad grocery backpacking. So if you put like your your milk

2025
04:10:10,579 --> 04:10:12,260
Inside of a bag like that

2026
04:10:12,260 --> 04:10:15,139
And you don't have anything else to put the weight on the other side. You're gonna fuck yourself up

2027
04:10:30,059 --> 04:10:39,340
Now full thrust you guys thought this was porn week, this is torture with I torture you on screen

2028
04:10:46,530 --> 04:10:50,430
Same thing

2029
04:10:53,059 --> 04:10:58,930
I can't wait for bug snacks tomorrow. I still i've got a lot of 3do games to play. Well, maybe we'll go back to 3do on sunday

2030
04:11:09,950 --> 04:11:13,090
I'm playing bug snacks tomorrow

2031
04:11:20,459 --> 04:11:29,889
Some of that bacon wine you like so much hell tuba. What is he even saying? Tell me you could pass up

2032
04:11:36,020 --> 04:11:38,020
He's talking about bug snacks

2033
04:11:49,709 --> 04:11:51,889
Oh, he hates bug snacks

2034
04:11:51,889 --> 04:11:53,889
I don't know what you guys are talking about. He hates it

2035
04:11:59,760 --> 04:12:03,010
Okay now

2036
04:12:03,010 --> 04:12:11,149
Where are we going now? Why are we going so slow?

2037
04:12:19,090 --> 04:12:20,610
It's very

2038
04:12:20,610 --> 04:12:22,610
When there's no sense of urgency at all

2039
04:12:32,020 --> 04:12:39,709
Uh, are we gonna get a final boss reveal here?

2040
04:12:40,510 --> 04:12:56,270
I guess that just about does in case you haven't noticed eric. We've done all six doors

2041
04:12:56,670 --> 04:13:01,870
We're fresh out of options. No more options. No, we can backtrack and find the things we missed the first time around

2042
04:13:01,870 --> 04:13:06,350
What we don't have time to go through this entire ship again get close to that sun. Remember?

2043
04:13:08,659 --> 04:13:15,870
Um, I don't do that might as well face it area. This floating mausoleum is taking a plunge

2044
04:13:16,670 --> 04:13:20,670
And we're going along for the ride. No, i'm not doing without a fight zack

2045
04:13:21,389 --> 04:13:27,219
You know your problem is eric you've never known when the fight is over

2046
04:13:38,690 --> 04:13:45,280
Why are they giving up

2047
04:13:45,280 --> 04:13:52,299
You're actually once

2048
04:13:56,770 --> 04:14:02,500
What I always hoped I'd die in better company. Oh, yes. No. Yes. Yeah, I mean too

2049
04:14:08,510 --> 04:14:10,510
Squeaky clothes have you figured that out?

2050
04:14:17,180 --> 04:14:26,780
What uh, okay, wait yellow

2051
04:14:27,579 --> 04:14:28,940
blue

2052
04:14:28,940 --> 04:14:30,780
yellow red

2053
04:14:30,780 --> 04:14:38,860
Where am I supposed to go?

2054
04:14:38,860 --> 04:14:48,979
red green

2055
04:14:48,979 --> 04:14:57,120
Red, all right, we're gonna go to red scan that

2056
04:15:01,200 --> 04:15:12,700
All right. I have red

2057
04:15:12,700 --> 04:15:14,700
alien pattern chroma symbols

2058
04:15:14,940 --> 04:15:20,540
Why is it not over?

2059
04:15:20,540 --> 04:15:24,510
Uh, I I think it is

2060
04:15:24,510 --> 04:15:36,379
Oh, thank god. I scanned this fucking door. That would have been horrible if I didn't. All right. Um, what are you doing?

2061
04:15:38,909 --> 04:15:40,909
This is the we're at the end. This is disc four, man

2062
04:15:41,229 --> 04:15:44,510
I warn you jeremy beat this game and one billion is added to that. I don't agree with that

2063
04:15:48,879 --> 04:15:53,629
I don't agree with that. What are you talking about? I was just telling me to insert disc two

2064
04:16:00,399 --> 04:16:08,260
What what do you mean disc two?

2065
04:16:08,260 --> 04:16:09,379
I don't understand

2066
04:16:09,379 --> 04:16:17,819
Why do I have to this game's not 40 hours long. We're on the final disc

2067
04:16:21,629 --> 04:16:25,389
Wait, this is you can skip the red door if you already have the orb from the crew quarters

2068
04:16:25,790 --> 04:16:41,459
Did I get the orb from the crew quarters? I got a orb fuck if I know

2069
04:16:44,299 --> 04:16:51,520
No, what the hell is this?

2070
04:16:51,520 --> 04:16:57,899
Is I didn't I never went in here. Oh, i'm really good at these. I'm really good at these i'll do fine

2071
04:16:58,559 --> 04:17:01,200
I already know what it wants me to do

2072
04:17:25,020 --> 04:17:27,020
This is a little bit harder than I thought it was gonna be but it's all right

2073
04:17:34,209 --> 04:17:45,409
All right, I have to make everything on I got it then um

2074
04:17:48,850 --> 04:17:55,760
What is it what does it want to do?

2075
04:17:55,760 --> 04:18:08,399
Oh, this actually is the fine guys. This is the final puzzle of the game. Wait, what the fuck I have to do that

2076
04:18:11,569 --> 04:18:15,600

Okay, hold on

It's close

2081
04:18:54,129 --> 04:18:56,129

2082
04:18:57,579 --> 04:19:00,700
Hold on wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

And then

2085
04:19:38,479 --> 04:19:40,479
It's the final puzzle of the game I got it

2086
04:19:45,629 --> 04:19:49,280
Hmm

2087
04:19:51,040 --> 04:19:54,110
None of you got shit on me

2088
04:19:54,110 --> 04:19:55,950
None of you got shit on me

2089
04:19:55,950 --> 04:19:58,500
None of you got shit on me

2090
04:19:58,500 --> 04:20:02,420
Ain't nobody got shit on me. Ain't nobody got shit on me

2091
04:20:03,139 --> 04:20:14,590
Now what?

2092
04:20:14,590 --> 04:20:26,979
Uh, congrats. You beat it on easy. Who cares?

2093
04:20:27,780 --> 04:20:31,229
Eat the bug. I don't think I can eat the bug

2094
04:20:46,899 --> 04:20:58,750
Uh, what am I supposed to be doing bug? Wait. No, I was already in here. What happened? Did I get an orb?

2095
04:20:59,229 --> 04:21:18,209
Did I get an orb? I don't remember getting an up an orb in here. Snap the disc. No, there's no

2096
04:21:18,850 --> 04:21:29,620
Does anybody remember if I got an orb in here? Can I tell if I have one? How many do I have?

2097
04:21:30,260 --> 04:21:38,850
I can't even I don't have that info. Is an orb an egg?

2098
04:21:39,569 --> 04:21:44,770
I'm so fucking close. I've got to just get I have to end this. I'm so close

2099
04:21:46,049 --> 04:21:56,159
It's something in this room. Is this the room where you paid no attention?

2100
04:21:58,319 --> 04:22:25,819
Absolutely, this is open. All right. This one doesn't open. Does this one open the whole game? You mean have I been in here?

2101
04:22:26,690 --> 04:22:36,530
I don't think i've been in here. Is it an orb? I can't select it

2102
04:22:37,250 --> 04:22:49,979
Orb orb orb. I can't get it. No, I can't get anything in here an orb in here

2103
04:22:56,579 --> 04:22:58,420
I don't I didn't there's not one in there

2104
04:22:58,420 --> 04:23:04,819
Is what happens when poop wine gets in your veins somebody you didn't say that. I just said that for you

2105
04:23:11,020 --> 04:23:13,180
Do I already have the thing?

2106
04:23:13,180 --> 04:23:16,059
You can skip the red door if you already have the orb from the crew quarters

2107
04:23:16,139 --> 04:23:20,780
But you're assuming this walked was assuming that I paid attention to anything that happened like four hours ago

2108
04:23:21,260 --> 04:23:44,479
I have this sneaking suspicion. He's nowhere near the end. No, this is the finale what they said's

2109
04:23:44,940 --> 04:23:50,440
Backtrack you added a backtrack section to the finale you assholes

2110
04:24:03,260 --> 04:24:04,399
Okay

2111
04:24:04,399 --> 04:24:08,719
This says go to the crew quarters kill the alien and get the orb

2112
04:24:11,090 --> 04:24:26,620
Uh, this is what is I don't see an alien. Didn't this alien die already?

2113
04:24:27,100 --> 04:24:31,520
Did we pull an orb out of this alien?

2114
04:24:34,670 --> 04:24:38,750
It didn't it was like oh there was something glowing. We pulled an orb out of the alien's head

2115
04:24:39,229 --> 04:24:43,840
Remember the alien that came down and died and the thing glue was glowing on his head

2116
04:24:43,840 --> 04:24:48,350
Didn't we pull it out of him? We pulled an orb out of his head. Didn't we I don't remember

2117
04:24:48,430 --> 04:24:58,450
It felt like it was like two weeks ago. No, you did not do that. Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

2118
04:24:59,090 --> 04:25:08,000
Glowed but I didn't interact with it. This is obviously the crew quarters

2119
04:25:08,639 --> 04:25:40,379
That's obviously an orb up there. Here we go. Here we go. Let's go. I have to look in each one of these holes

2120
04:25:42,379 --> 04:25:45,329
No way

2121
04:25:55,649 --> 04:26:00,829
I see something in there

2122
04:26:02,319 --> 04:26:03,680
No

2123
04:26:03,680 --> 04:26:05,680
No, I don't wanna

2124
04:26:08,940 --> 04:26:11,340
No, I have to look at all the holes

2125
04:26:11,819 --> 04:26:37,739
I'm gonna get jump scared turn on the light. I can't just be ready to kill the bug. I'm ready

2126
04:26:39,090 --> 04:26:52,379
I'm gonna laser this fucking thing the second it shows up. Oh Jesus

2127
04:26:55,729 --> 04:26:57,969
I'm gonna absolutely laser the fuck out of this thing

2128
04:27:13,520 --> 04:27:16,719
I try to think of the logic when you make a game like this, right? Like, okay

2129
04:27:16,799 --> 04:27:20,799
Let's have like 40 holes that you look in and each hole takes

2130
04:27:22,000 --> 04:27:28,750
Like six or seven seconds to look in I try to imagine the the the functionality here

2131
04:27:44,209 --> 04:27:46,209
Is it is it in is it in?

2132
04:27:46,850 --> 04:27:57,219
Turn the light on. I don't I have no light you have to activate night vision. There's nothing in the holes. What?

2133
04:28:00,059 --> 04:28:17,170
Bullshit, why would they have you do this top row top row top row top row?

2134
04:28:26,989 --> 04:28:36,930
You're doing it. Please need to check all the holes twice. No, you don't

2135
04:28:37,569 --> 04:28:52,180
The best part about this is the walkthrough just says go to the crew quarters kill the alien get the orb

2136
04:28:52,420 --> 04:28:57,979
They didn't they left out the part where you have to look in 100 holes. Is there another walkthrough?

2137
04:29:06,559 --> 04:29:07,940
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait

2138
04:29:07,940 --> 04:29:12,340
Enter through the partially open door into the crew quarters and cross over to the far side come back to the door side

2139
04:29:12,659 --> 04:29:17,059
Swing right to the second column of triads click on the lower triad than the upper right hole

2140
04:29:18,180 --> 04:29:20,260
Can you say can you say that to me like in english?

2141
04:29:21,860 --> 04:29:25,860
Like come back to the door side swing right to the second column of triads click on the lower triad than upper

2142
04:29:27,200 --> 04:29:35,840
I can't I like I I can't understand what that's saying partially open door come back to the door side

2143
04:29:36,319 --> 04:29:40,159
Swing right to the second column of triads click on the lower

2144
04:29:43,409 --> 04:29:46,299
What?

2145
04:29:46,299 --> 04:29:48,299
Wait, go back towards the door

2146
04:29:56,159 --> 04:30:00,379
Okay, swing right

2147
04:30:00,379 --> 04:30:02,139
second column

2148
04:30:02,139 --> 04:30:04,299
lower ones top right

2149
04:30:25,809 --> 04:30:28,979
I can't believe this is in the game. I can't

2150
04:30:29,620 --> 04:30:49,360
I can't believe it. This is the guy that actively tortured his viewers

2151
04:30:49,440 --> 04:30:52,079
Yes, because what I want this should be a lesson and that you all right

2152
04:30:52,079 --> 04:30:55,440
Those you guys that are like teaching game design in college or whatever some of your professors here

2153
04:30:56,079 --> 04:31:04,049
Download just get this whole game and then make your class play it and say don't fucking do that. Don't do this ever

2154
04:31:04,450 --> 04:31:20,239
This is educational purposes at this point professor professor elbison. Why did you make us do this?

2155
04:31:20,319 --> 04:31:22,079
We had to look through all these holes

2156
04:31:22,079 --> 04:31:22,959
Yeah

2157
04:31:22,959 --> 04:31:24,319
Sucked didn't it?

2158
04:31:24,319 --> 04:31:26,879
Yeah, it was horrible and like the the part of the game we had like

2159
04:31:28,000 --> 04:31:29,600
scan the the

2160
04:31:29,600 --> 04:31:32,479
Scan the wall and stuff. Yeah, that part was bad too. Wasn't it?

2161
04:31:33,120 --> 04:31:35,200
Why did you make us do that?

2162
04:31:35,200 --> 04:31:38,719
And then I take my glasses off and put my fucking feet on the desk

2163
04:31:41,680 --> 04:31:43,680
Why don't you tell me?

2164
04:31:44,430 --> 04:31:48,940
You'll be the teacher and I have the teacher student cup. No, not bare feet

2165
04:31:51,819 --> 04:31:53,340
All right, where?

2166
04:31:53,340 --> 04:31:58,899
I'm told i'm getting tortured too. You know that right like i'm but I have to finish it

2167
04:31:59,299 --> 04:32:05,520
This is one of those torture streams where I torture the fuck out of myself for educational purposes only

2168
04:32:09,219 --> 04:32:10,500
I missed one

2169
04:32:10,500 --> 04:32:12,739
Okay, this is towards the door swing, right?

2170
04:32:13,139 --> 04:32:24,739
Was spam that coffee pasta again, please watch the speed run it was fake

2171
04:32:31,420 --> 04:32:34,940
Back it back to uh back to the channel that speed running it

2172
04:32:35,899 --> 04:32:40,100
Okay, let's see

2173
04:32:40,100 --> 04:32:46,739
he comes in

2174
04:32:46,739 --> 04:32:54,479
Torture, this is the definition of sunk cost fallacy. Yeah, but eventually okay

2175
04:32:54,479 --> 04:33:01,420
So you go towards the back and then bang of right?

2176
04:33:01,420 --> 04:33:04,459
It's almost over and I can't wait for it to be over and by the way, we're not done

2177
04:33:04,540 --> 04:33:06,459
Like i'm not done streaming after this

2178
04:33:08,000 --> 04:33:10,400
So it's the you go to the second one and then

2179
04:33:12,509 --> 04:33:14,500
I didn't already do that

2180
04:33:14,500 --> 04:33:33,380
Top left one. Oh my little one. I didn't look in I can't imagine sitting here and doing this not having like a walk

2181
04:33:34,580 --> 04:33:36,740
Okay, attack it. That was really scary

2182
04:33:37,700 --> 04:33:43,569
Shoot him. That was scary

2183
04:33:50,540 --> 04:33:51,340
You know

2184
04:33:51,340 --> 04:33:52,540
Give me the orb

2185
04:33:52,540 --> 04:33:54,849
Let me open give me the fuck out of here

2186
04:33:54,849 --> 04:34:01,099
Give me the orb

2187
04:34:05,770 --> 04:34:09,950
BDSM stream show us your webcam and yeah, you're gonna get a bds

2188
04:34:12,029 --> 04:34:15,869
I turn on the webcam. I'm in like a bunch of bdsm gear. Now that would have been funny

2189
04:34:17,569 --> 04:34:20,770
That would have been really funny. It would have been worth the four and a half hours of torture

2190
04:34:21,250 --> 04:34:26,049
Okay, can I get the can I get the orb that fell out of his head?

2191
04:34:26,689 --> 04:34:50,369
Okay, I got it. We're done. Let's go you guys getting pumped. Here we go. We're out

2192
04:34:50,930 --> 04:35:07,650
Now we have to go to the yellow door. We're done. Watch out for the revved up heavy

2193
04:35:20,299 --> 04:35:22,299
That was

2194
04:35:23,099 --> 04:35:25,790
That was really good

2195
04:35:26,270 --> 04:35:29,619
Very very funny

2196
04:35:29,619 --> 04:35:52,349
Okay, yellow door. That's a brass beast. Not just any minigun. Oh natasha. You're right. No wrong. That's wrong

2197
04:36:03,150 --> 04:36:05,150
Why does that take my favorite thing of the day?

2198
04:36:13,150 --> 04:36:15,950
Just around one of these corridors it's just a heavy

2199
04:36:18,580 --> 04:36:21,060
That person made it all worth it. They really did

2200
04:36:28,979 --> 04:36:32,610
Here we go

2201
04:36:32,610 --> 04:36:36,930
Let's go. Let's go yellow door yellow door yellow door. Look what I found guys

2202
04:36:49,470 --> 04:36:51,470

04:37:03,919 --> 04:37:05,919
All right, uh go to the yellow door

2206
04:37:15,650 --> 04:37:18,450
yellow door

04:37:18,450 --> 04:37:35,630
Yep, scan it. All right. They don't already have this

2208
04:37:36,349 --> 04:37:42,060
I already have the yellow door

2209
04:37:42,060 --> 04:37:47,790
Yeah, I already have this door. They did the puzzle already. Yeah, this shit just opens man

2210
04:37:53,470 --> 04:38:01,069
This this says go through the to go through the next door and then turn left

2211
04:38:14,540 --> 04:38:34,849
Okay, go through this door and there's apparently an orb in here and then just to the left of this door

2212
04:38:36,340 --> 04:38:59,299
There is an orb dispenser right here. Oh the other left. Oh, hi

2213
04:38:59,299 --> 04:39:02,779
Hi, all right

2214
04:39:02,779 --> 04:39:23,220
Uh, this is right. I can't really interact with anything even with the guide because it's like go

2215
04:39:23,779 --> 04:39:25,700
Okay, i'm gonna read the seal out

2216
04:39:25,700 --> 04:39:30,340
Click yellow to open it go through the next door turn left go through the door and turn around just to the left of

2217
04:39:30,340 --> 04:39:44,340
The door I was right. All right, then it says send it yellow

2218
04:39:48,259 --> 04:39:58,619

04:39:58,619 --> 04:40:05,939
Grab it. Nice orb number three

2220
04:40:06,500 --> 04:40:12,900
Pick it up. Everybody. Just pick your hands up

2221
04:40:13,540 --> 04:40:15,299

Everybody put your hands. Um just stand up. Put your hands up everybody just stand up

2223
04:40:27,540 --> 04:40:29,380

Everybody to stand up

2228
04:40:51,840 --> 04:40:56,000
Now we go back to the hub and we have all three orbs and then we can finally end this

2229
04:40:56,000 --> 04:40:58,000
I

2230
04:40:58,779 --> 04:41:00,819
Don't even know which one of these doors goes back to the hub

2231
04:41:00,819 --> 04:41:04,919
We're gonna click on random ones and if we find the way back to the hub, I have no idea. I'm crying. I'm crying

2232
04:41:04,919 --> 04:41:06,380
I'm crying. I'm crying

2233
04:41:06,380 --> 04:41:16,869
Well, what happened? I'm not gonna that's like a sexual thing. I'm not gonna put that on screen. This is not the right way

2234
04:41:16,869 --> 04:41:27,069
Is it I'm lost wait? No, I'm lost. How do I go? What do I get out of here?

2235
04:41:27,069 --> 04:41:47,000
I don't know. I'm actually lost you can sit down here. This is the wrong way. Yeah backtrack

2236
04:41:48,250 --> 04:42:00,689
Absolute bullshit. I fall off here and I swear I'm gonna be so upset. What the fuck are we doing here? What is this?

2237
04:42:02,750 --> 04:42:16,270
How did I get a hair why am I here go back get me the hell out of there I'm rage finishing the game

2238
04:42:18,119 --> 04:42:26,349
This is a case study. This is an educational stream some reason they decided to put us upside down

2239
04:42:42,830 --> 04:42:58,880
Actually like this one you can't add any debt unless I agree to it I have to agree to it

2240
04:42:58,959 --> 04:43:18,869
Is there even a door here isn't this the way that I just came oh go to go that go to that blurry direction

2241
04:43:19,069 --> 04:43:29,069
Wait, this is not you see the link yet. Is it it's the wrong way again

2242
04:43:30,310 --> 04:43:34,799
It's just

2243
04:43:34,799 --> 04:43:36,799
unclear fucking anything

2244
04:43:40,860 --> 04:43:45,599
Just reload the last chapter from the menu, I hope this works

2245
04:43:46,299 --> 04:43:51,270
Wait, does that it's gonna work. Is this actually gonna work? I don't know man

2246
04:43:52,029 --> 04:43:54,000
Should I've not have done that?

2247
04:43:54,040 --> 04:44:02,700
Don't know I don't know if I should have done that. Oh my god. Should I not have done that? Oh my god

2248
04:44:02,700 --> 04:44:07,680
Oh my god, what do I do? What have I done? What the fuck did I do?

2249
04:44:08,279 --> 04:44:14,740
Please don't tell me I fucked this whole thing up. I'm not I'm telling you right now

2250
04:44:14,740 --> 04:44:18,259
I'm not going back and doing this shit again. I would rather eat my own hand

2251
04:44:18,259 --> 04:44:22,419
I'd rather you cut my fucking hand off and put it in the oven and cook it like 350 for two hours

2252
04:44:22,419 --> 04:44:28,400
And I eat it on stream. I'd rather do that then go back and do the like last 45 minutes

2253
04:44:28,439 --> 04:44:35,549
I know I said I'm gonna shit my pants like shit all over me and then before I just gonna go on back and beat it

2254
04:44:35,549 --> 04:44:45,619
I'd rather eat myself. I'd rather fucking pull it myself. Right. I've said this like three times. Do I have the orbs?

2255
04:44:47,360 --> 04:44:51,759
Please tell me I have I don't want to go back. I don't want to go back. I can't go back

2256
04:44:51,759 --> 04:44:58,909
I can't go back. Is there with me to check? Oh my please god. I hope I don't have to go back

2257
04:44:58,909 --> 04:45:05,939
I hope I don't have to if I I please I have all the orbs, right?

2258
04:45:05,939 --> 04:45:11,020
I got them all and I just went I just did different scenes

2259
04:45:21,610 --> 04:45:23,970
Definitely keeps it stored in the cache. I know it does

2260
04:45:24,569 --> 04:45:34,840
Stored in the cache because the other ones were stored and we jumped around to different sections of the game. It's ready

2261
04:45:34,840 --> 04:45:41,290
It's here comes the three orbs. We have them. Oh, wow. You found them. Wow, you got all the orbs put the orbs in here

2262
04:45:41,569 --> 04:45:48,810
You did a great job Casey. Excellent work. We all love you and you're all very you're smart. You're very smart

2263
04:45:49,490 --> 04:45:54,180
We don't did it and here are your three orbs

2264
04:45:54,880 --> 04:45:57,310
Here are the orbs

2265
04:45:57,549 --> 04:45:59,549
Hey

2266
04:46:15,180 --> 04:46:17,180
No, it's not even

2267
04:46:18,540 --> 04:46:19,939
Why

2268
04:46:19,939 --> 04:46:24,080
Why why why why why?

2269
04:46:27,860 --> 04:46:37,759
Why I know it I know what they all are. I'm gonna eat my fucking hand

2270
04:46:38,200 --> 04:46:44,349
Add this to worst meltdown of the year. I don't care. This job. I have to I'm gonna eat my fucking hand put it in the oven

2271
04:46:45,069 --> 04:46:58,799
Open this fucking door right now. I know where they all are. I know where they are. You're building the guillotine

2272
04:46:58,799 --> 04:47:00,799
I'll put my head in that thing

2273
04:47:06,700 --> 04:47:09,419
Open the fucking door. What are you doing?

2274
04:47:10,020 --> 04:47:17,599
What? Oh

2275
04:47:17,599 --> 04:47:42,520
Man, this this game probably costs like 30 million dollars to make crack each disc in half when you're done

2276
04:47:42,680 --> 04:47:47,400
Why I don't even know why I listen somebody said hey skip but it was perfect in perfect reason though

2277
04:47:47,400 --> 04:47:53,520
It was very reasonable thing to say like go to the menu and skip all this and then you were right

2278
04:47:53,520 --> 04:48:07,950
You were so right that would that made perfect sense. You're a monster. I know that's okay. I'll wear that

2279
04:48:07,950 --> 04:48:09,069
I'll wear that today

2280
04:48:09,069 --> 04:48:15,229
But we're like of one cutscene away from beating this game and I cannot I can't get to the end of this shit

2281
04:48:15,229 --> 04:48:24,319
And then give the fuck up. This is perseverance. I know exactly where it is. Just get it

2282
04:48:24,319 --> 04:48:31,040
I know the other one is just get it and then just keep track of where you are. I bet this left not that way

2283
04:48:31,159 --> 04:48:34,909
Okay

2284
04:48:34,909 --> 04:48:37,069
Okay, so when I come out I take a left and leave

2285
04:48:37,630 --> 04:48:55,930
Done shoot the alien in the head. This game sucks though. What the hell I know I know and I knew it

2286
04:48:56,270 --> 04:49:01,389
Okay, after our number two, I knew it sucked but it kept me here. It

2287
04:49:02,150 --> 04:49:06,229
It's forcing me to beat it with like radiation rays

2288
04:49:06,229 --> 04:49:08,409
I don't know what this thing's emitting but it's making me want to do it

2289
04:49:08,509 --> 04:49:27,069
See this look at how much fashion this was this time. We're good done. I already got one. Why is he dead?

2290
04:49:27,470 --> 04:49:35,680
What are you talking about? So I have wait I have this one. I have this I have it

2291
04:49:36,080 --> 04:50:12,540
Why do I you need to go yellow instead? But now hold on I didn't turn I'm not softlocked with the exit over here

2292
04:50:15,939 --> 04:50:23,659
Default return scene. No, no, it's because the yellow one. I didn't turn it in it remembers that I turned in this one

2293
04:50:23,659 --> 04:50:31,979
I didn't give the yellow one yet. That's true. Okay. All right, makes sense. I have to change fucking discs again

2294
04:50:32,259 --> 04:50:36,500
There is no God I know this now

2295
04:50:36,500 --> 04:50:45,189
this is the evidence of it imagine if you're one of the game developers and you happen to stumble upon this stream and

2296
04:50:45,229 --> 04:50:48,069
this guy watching it and seeing how much everyone hates this and

2297
04:50:48,630 --> 04:50:54,750
Then you hear somebody you you read somebody in the chat that says there is no God because of this game in this frame

2298
04:50:54,869 --> 04:50:59,220
Like you gotta click the X and just like kind of go like take a shower

2299
04:50:59,840 --> 04:51:03,740
like you can't

2300
04:51:03,740 --> 04:51:10,419
Somebody's playing the tidalis encounter. I like was a game designer on that. There is no God because of this game

2301
04:51:10,500 --> 04:51:12,459
Oh

2302
04:51:12,459 --> 04:51:16,790
What the fuck? Holy shit shuttle down

2303
04:51:17,490 --> 04:51:25,759
What's wrong with you guys? You don't understand. We were working on computers that had like 56k motive

2304
04:51:28,459 --> 04:51:33,540
And loading up one of these FMVs into our program took three days

2305
04:51:34,099 --> 04:51:39,599
Fuck all of you assholes. How dare you this game was like

2306
04:51:40,139 --> 04:51:56,770
Gold back 30 years ago. We're gonna let this asshole talk shit about it. I mean, they're right there. You know, they're right there

2307
04:52:12,500 --> 04:52:25,139
All right, let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it

2308
04:52:25,500 --> 04:52:35,810
And the left the orb. All right, bang a left and when we come up with being in a right remember that

2309
04:52:36,130 --> 04:52:44,639
Let's get lost Omega Loaf

2310
04:52:45,799 --> 04:52:55,409
There it is

2311
04:52:55,409 --> 04:53:18,159
Excuse me. Give me that orb. I'll take it who tis grab that shit. There's no skipping cutscenes

2312
04:53:18,560 --> 04:53:25,860
I wish I could add up. All right out of here bang a right straight through that door

2313
04:53:25,860 --> 04:53:35,419
Get me the fuck out of here and the game and it you're aging your chat by playing this look

2314
04:53:35,419 --> 04:53:38,349
It's only been like, okay

2315
04:53:38,349 --> 04:53:45,740
I have probably like six thousand hours on stream four or five of these are day Dallas encounter

2316
04:53:45,779 --> 04:53:49,659
That's like zero point zero zero zero one percent of all the streams I've done

2317
04:53:49,659 --> 04:53:55,340
That's not so that means a ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of all streams were fucking incredible games

2318
04:53:55,939 --> 04:53:59,979
Well besides half of them that we're not very good. So I'd say like

2319
04:54:00,619 --> 04:54:05,490
Forty nine point nine nine nine percent are very good games

2320
04:54:05,490 --> 04:54:23,340
All right, he keeps doing he keeps playing trash games over and over again, but they're the most charming except for this one fuck this

2321
04:54:23,340 --> 04:54:26,700
I'm gonna stream I'm doing a spite stream. All right, whatever fine

2322
04:54:26,700 --> 04:54:30,939
Well, you're gonna you can upload pictures of me like then talk shit to me on my own new stream

04:54:30,939 --> 04:54:32,939
You're gonna talk you're gonna do like a shit talking stream

2324
04:54:36,569 --> 04:54:40,069
He's gonna restream my stream and then talk a bunch of shit about me

2325
04:54:41,900 --> 04:54:46,580
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna be a big trouble if you do that one

2326
04:54:56,159 --> 04:55:19,080
Now what what that's all the orbs go to the orange door. He didn't know

2327
04:55:35,250 --> 04:55:42,340
New offer, please stop. Oh my fucking god, please stop stop make it stop

2328
04:55:43,340 --> 04:55:56,580
Why do I look like that what's wrong with my eyes? All right, let's go. This is the final door. I know it

2329
04:55:56,580 --> 04:55:58,500
This is the last door. I know it for a fact

2330
04:55:58,500 --> 04:56:18,389
It's free after you end the game on disc three. That's kind of weird that an hour ago

2331
04:56:18,830 --> 04:56:21,759
I'm just going by what the we're in the finale

2332
04:56:22,319 --> 04:56:40,750
The finale was two hours ago. Yeah, it's a long finale

2333

Orange door go to the medical center. Wait, isn't this the and we already been down here

2334
04:56:53,029 --> 04:57:12,520

2335
04:57:17,290 --> 04:57:34,569
All right. Well, yes, you know what? Oh, we've got something over here. Oh

2336
04:57:37,450 --> 04:57:39,450

04:57:39,490 --> 04:58:01,590
Was this I didn't I didn't scan the orange door

2338
04:58:23,400 --> 04:58:29,959
There's only like five sentences left in the walkthrough guys. Don't worry. We're gonna get through this together

2339
04:58:30,200 --> 04:58:44,279
We're gonna get through this. I know I'm like talking like this a zombie apocalypse right now

2340
04:58:44,319 --> 04:58:59,950
We're gonna get through this just stay together. Oh, fuck you. Oh, please end the game

2341
04:58:59,950 --> 04:59:17,599
I'm done going as fast as I can. I'm going as fast as I can Nevada stream

2342
04:59:17,599 --> 04:59:29,029
I'm going faster than that. I don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't okay

2343
04:59:37,990 --> 04:59:48,459
Why don't you get up and help why don't you get up and help me skin the door?

2344
04:59:48,459 --> 05:00:00,680
I can't believe I have to scan another door. How did I not get this skin?

2345
05:00:11,310 --> 05:00:14,029
7,000 people were tortured today in a freak streaming accident

2346
05:00:14,750 --> 05:00:25,740
How would it be a freak streaming accident if I'm deliberately torturing you? There it is. Okay, go on in

2347
05:00:34,200 --> 05:00:36,880
Or a freak streaming accident where a guy

2348
05:00:37,720 --> 05:00:40,759
Tortured seven thousand people for five hours

2349
05:00:41,240 --> 05:00:45,740
No, I didn't like leave the stove on

2350
05:00:46,180 --> 05:01:22,560
You're the Joker. I'm not the Joker. I'm the Riddler now anybody that says they're the Riddler is actually the Joker

2351
05:01:23,080 --> 05:01:54,950
Anybody that says they're the Joker is actually the penguin that recycled joke. Well, maybe okay. Wait, what's this?

2352
05:01:54,950 --> 05:01:59,729
I touch anything else in here before I end, you know, we're in the last two sentences of

2353
05:02:00,770 --> 05:02:01,770
the

2354
05:02:01,770 --> 05:02:14,139
Game, you know what I mean guys, you know, I mean, I actually played penguin in the show Gotham. You're pretty talented actor

2355
05:02:14,139 --> 05:02:35,979
He's actually pretty good that what's an actor's name that actor seriously really good or but number four done got it

2359
05:03:27,020 --> 05:03:41,819
No, that's not accurate. That's not accurate. It's not true. That's not I have the I have the guide right in front of me

2360
05:03:41,819 --> 05:04:16,900
The guide is right here across the guide Pepe left. Yeah, why wouldn't I first stage?

2361
05:04:16,900 --> 05:04:21,009
I thought you said first disk of grief, which would have been much funnier

2362
05:04:36,419 --> 05:04:38,419
Just you guys

2363
05:04:40,720 --> 05:04:55,909
The five discs of grief wait, what do you mean? No, I don't I don't know there's no more discs

2364
05:04:55,909 --> 05:04:57,389
What do you mean? I have to get well, I don't know where they are

2365
05:04:57,389 --> 05:05:20,540
The guy didn't say to get these these spheres the guy did not say to get the spheres. Where is these other spheres? What?

2366
05:05:20,700 --> 05:05:37,139
Ah

2367
05:05:37,139 --> 05:05:42,060
Ain't worth it. It's been five hours

2368
05:05:44,020 --> 05:05:51,650
Six orbs who is this for you hate playing and we hate watching

2369
05:05:56,689 --> 05:06:03,619
It's not for me and it's not for you so who is this for I don't know who this is for

2370
05:06:03,619 --> 05:06:07,220
I can't even tell you I wish I could say it's for me. It's not

2371
05:06:07,740 --> 05:06:22,599
What what's this for? It's just it's to complete it. It's just playing itself turn it off

2372
05:06:22,639 --> 05:06:24,880
Stop then. Uh, but what I

2373
05:06:25,639 --> 05:06:33,259
But I'm busy much time in here, but there's so much time in here. Well, wait, let me just see how quickly this could be

2374
05:06:33,259 --> 05:06:35,380
I'm already at four out of six stones

2375
05:06:36,099 --> 05:06:38,049
stones

2376
05:06:38,049 --> 05:06:54,340
Guys, my go XLR is broken. I can't even mess with any of the settings. Does it sound like this the whole time?

2377
05:06:54,540 --> 05:07:07,090
All right, what we where are the last two cubes? There are five orbs. All right, there's only five

2378
05:07:07,430 --> 05:07:12,430
Where's the last one? Where's that last one blue hole?

2379
05:07:12,830 --> 05:07:25,450
Was that last one guys? They're not seven orbs. This is five blue hall. Hold on

2380
05:07:25,729 --> 05:07:38,610
Okay, I'm facing the statue click blue and see the orbit. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

2381
05:07:38,610 --> 05:07:43,330
We go go go go go go go go go go go go go. This is green, but fuck. It's okay

2382
05:07:43,330 --> 05:08:03,279
Go back. We're gonna go through the blue door. I got the I know where the blue one is blue door

2383
05:08:03,419 --> 05:08:07,700
Let's go. I saw the blue

2384
05:08:07,939 --> 05:08:16,659
Orb up top. I already have the blue door scanned. I got it. Okay, so we go through here. Just go in

2385
05:08:24,939 --> 05:08:30,750
I'm trying to hit blue. There's three you got it quick. Now. I know exactly what I'm doing

2386
05:08:32,259 --> 05:08:34,619
There's so many fingerprints on the bottom of that disk. I don't care

2387
05:08:35,099 --> 05:08:46,049
Okay, so when we're facing the statue click blue and see the orbit puzzle

2388
05:08:46,209 --> 05:09:06,229
There's a statue in this room. Look for that statue and then the orb is in the statue

2389
05:09:06,310 --> 05:09:29,400
This is very is huge room. The orb is inside of Casey. Well, you just fucking ruin the game

2390
05:09:29,639 --> 05:09:37,869
Okay, there's an orb inside of this. Here we go. Use blue

2391
05:09:48,459 --> 05:10:11,909
How do I use blue trying to use blue when facing the statue click blue and see the orbit puzzle

2392
05:10:12,209 --> 05:10:33,439
Shit. All right, we go. Now what?

2393
05:10:41,240 --> 05:11:00,340
What did I just do?

2394
05:11:00,340 --> 05:11:04,939
Okay, what four of the planets are directly movable call them a B C and D

2395
05:11:05,139 --> 05:11:15,540
Okay, or the planets are movable. They're ordered in the bottom right selection window

2396
05:11:15,540 --> 05:11:27,479
You must move the fifth planet over the Sun move a to 11 o'clock

2397
05:11:27,720 --> 05:11:37,299
Which one is a move a to wait analog move a to 11 o'clock. I need the analog clock

2398
05:11:40,729 --> 05:11:44,950
Hold on move a to 11 o'clock

2399
05:11:46,340 --> 05:12:03,939
I don't even understand what the fuck you're talking about. Am I move am I moving the planet right now? Okay

2400
05:12:03,939 --> 05:12:15,979
Well, here's like 11. I can't like directly touch them. Okay, so this is this one's here a at 11 o'clock

2401
05:12:16,540 --> 05:12:22,340

2402
05:12:22,340 --> 05:12:24,340
C to 430

2403
05:12:26,220 --> 05:12:28,650
C to

2404
05:12:30,549 --> 05:12:35,340
12 1 2 3

2405
05:12:36,900 --> 05:12:48,869
430 what the fuck are you talking about put it in 120? What? I?

2406
05:12:54,790 --> 05:13:13,409
Don't like understand what where's this fifth planet? Look at the bottom left. Yeah, but this am I how I

2407
05:13:13,689 --> 05:13:23,080
Don't even know what I'm looking at here. This is the planet in the middle, but I'm not moving this planet

2408
05:13:23,119 --> 05:13:35,169
How do I do how do I move the actual planets instead of just but why does it put a to like 1130?

2409
05:13:35,169 --> 05:13:37,599
Like what is even talking about?

2410
05:13:37,639 --> 05:13:40,650
ragget like

2411
05:13:42,810 --> 05:13:44,810
Jesus what the hell is this?

2412
05:13:45,930 --> 05:13:53,799
Okay, put a to 11

2413
05:13:54,560 --> 05:13:56,659
Alright a at 11

2414
05:13:56,659 --> 05:14:00,500
C 430

2415
05:14:00,500 --> 05:14:29,849
See it's like that's like kind of 430 right B to 120. Where is it? It's kind of 120

2416
05:14:36,779 --> 05:14:41,009
It's like 11 right up here

2417
05:14:41,770 --> 05:14:54,130
Now what move to face the statue and click send that's for what?

2418
05:14:54,810 --> 05:15:21,610
Isn't this the one I'm moving up here? No, look at the yellow dot. What planet am I actually trying to get to?

2419
05:15:21,849 --> 05:15:24,009
This is too fucking much

2420
05:15:26,369 --> 05:15:43,299
This is just this is just bizarrely set up. This is put this to 11 o'clock. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa

2421
05:15:44,220 --> 05:15:58,330
Wait like this like put that there. Let's see 430

2422
05:16:01,000 --> 05:16:03,680
Wasn't I I was already doing that. All right, this is like 430

2423
05:16:05,459 --> 05:16:10,380
D 120 it's already there

2424
05:16:11,659 --> 05:16:32,060
Wow, what this is C C is that 120 a at 11 C at 430 D at 120

2425
05:16:32,060 --> 05:16:36,349
Oh

2426
05:16:37,110 --> 05:16:43,330
I'm too drunk for this. I feel like a microwave

2427
05:16:43,930 --> 05:16:51,680
Then send it. Well, no, this this has to be doesn't have to be I have to be over the this right

2428
05:16:52,080 --> 05:16:54,639
It doesn't say anything about B

2429
05:16:55,290 --> 05:16:59,569
Solution move a to 11 C to 430 D to 120 you might need some minor adjustments

2430
05:16:59,569 --> 05:17:01,770
But you do not have to move C at all

2431
05:17:02,209 --> 05:17:14,040
What B is they it's wrong. It's a typo C to 430 a B to 430

2432
05:17:14,799 --> 05:17:22,130
C you don't have to move C at all. So where was C in the beginning?

2433
05:17:22,330 --> 05:17:37,750
It literally says solution move a to 11 C to 430 D to 120. You don't have to move C at all

2434
05:17:49,479 --> 05:17:59,270
They meant B at the end well, how is it a to 4 a to 11 a to 11?

2435
05:18:00,580 --> 05:18:03,459
C to 430

2436
05:18:04,020 --> 05:18:15,569
E to

2437
05:18:15,729 --> 05:18:16,810
120

2438
05:18:16,810 --> 05:18:29,259
They're already so you don't have to move B at all. What what what is that it?

2439
05:18:29,900 --> 05:18:45,900
All right, send it. Oh, it's wrong. B was good. So the so the so the guide was wrong make minor adjustments

2440
05:18:46,720 --> 05:19:12,119
That's not 120

2441
05:19:12,680 --> 05:19:15,840
12 what this is 120 right here

2442
05:19:17,279 --> 05:19:25,250
By the way, there is no minute hand. So what are you talking about? He's been looking at the wrong guide

2443
05:19:25,689 --> 05:19:36,599
Give me give me another guide. This one's fucking wrong. There's no minute hand

2444
05:19:37,000 --> 05:19:39,000
Omega lol stacum's brain

2445
05:19:39,520 --> 05:19:52,319
Somebody just had it planet 1 to 430 planet 2 3 planet 3 3 planet 4 of 330

2446
05:19:52,520 --> 05:19:54,360
That's completely

2447
05:19:54,360 --> 05:20:10,779
Inaccurate from the guide that I'm looking at right now. I think you might have a case of a CD

2448
05:20:11,439 --> 05:20:16,650
Remember chat left an hour ago. You're talking to nobody. This is on easy

2449
05:20:17,959 --> 05:20:32,900
Reset the puzzle. Hold on that reset. What is it? What this is? I don't think I can even reset

2450
05:20:32,900 --> 05:20:36,139
I don't I don't think I can reset this. I literally can't reset it

2451
05:20:41,740 --> 05:20:46,900
I have to turn the console off or restart the chapter. I'm not doing that. I'm gonna do it for him

2452
05:20:47,340 --> 05:20:54,029
Read this and it's a paste bin. I don't know what the fuck that is

2453
05:20:57,750 --> 05:21:03,240
Why does this have to suck? I can't stop

2454
05:21:03,880 --> 05:21:15,919
No, the guides were written like 25 years ago. So, of course, they're gonna be fucking inaccurate and messed up

2455
05:21:16,439 --> 05:21:28,840
There's only one walkthrough of this game that exists on game fax. It is one person on PC

2456
05:21:29,479 --> 05:21:45,840
Alright, what's that guy? Give me that guy again. There we go. Let's go. Let's go. Here it is

2457
05:21:47,310 --> 05:21:53,330
What does he got? What's he got? Let's see how fucking wrong this was. Okay, the one is completely wrong, by the way

2458
05:21:53,750 --> 05:22:09,200
So a is down here. See is fuck

2459
05:22:12,560 --> 05:22:19,939
Okay, a is actually right here a is literally right here it was completely fucking wrong

2460
05:22:20,360 --> 05:22:24,319
B is also right there

2461
05:22:24,880 --> 05:22:29,740
The guide was

2462
05:22:29,779 --> 05:22:31,340
1000% wrong

2463
05:22:31,340 --> 05:22:40,619
C is down at around 6 o'clock

2464
05:22:41,220 --> 05:22:51,799
Where is D? D is top left D

2465
05:22:54,490 --> 05:23:28,459
There it is. Count

2466
05:23:28,860 --> 05:24:00,810
This counts, right? I'm watching his stream. He's having trouble with it, too. Almost there. What happens when he gets it?

2467
05:24:00,810 --> 05:24:12,069
He's having trouble, too. Yeah, this like sucks. He's having trouble. I'm getting it too. I'm right there with you man

2468
05:24:12,069 --> 05:24:22,599
Oh, is that not it? That's not it

2469
05:24:23,319 --> 05:24:55,400
Yep, bunch of you guys had it wrong. Okay. What the fuck is this doing? What's this? What does he do? Quick, tell me what you do

2470
05:24:55,959 --> 05:25:22,400
What do you do? Use the blue code. It's the infinity stones. I

2471
05:25:23,159 --> 05:25:33,540
Can't believe I'm fucking still here doing this. What am I doing? Am I what's happening? Am I doing this?

2472
05:25:33,799 --> 05:25:40,930
Hey, this is it. I need one more after this is the green door

2473
05:25:41,610 --> 05:25:53,709
That green door man

2474
05:25:53,790 --> 05:26:15,080
Well, I need green hall. Okay. Okay. I know what to do. Oh, would you what would you rate this game so far?

2475
05:26:15,520 --> 05:26:22,200
What would you rate punching yourself in the stomach as hard as you can?

2476
05:26:22,200 --> 05:26:38,599
We're like a zero ain't I'd read it higher than this. Yeah, we lost like a thousand viewers. It's alright

2477
05:26:38,599 --> 05:26:43,380
It don't matter. They'll see you tomorrow for bugs next. I am need to spite-feet this game

2478
05:26:43,639 --> 05:27:00,650
This is the worst game you've ever played it might be but at least I can say I finished it

2479
05:27:00,650 --> 05:27:15,959
I'll be able to wear that on my sleeve forever. We have one more door to go into you haven't finished it yet

2480
05:27:15,959 --> 05:27:27,279
I'm about to the worse than saw to a thousand times worse saw to is would be at the game Awards ahead of this

2481
05:27:27,319 --> 05:27:39,340
All right green door turn around when you get to the black opening there's an orb dispenser

2482
05:27:41,580 --> 05:27:46,639
It's the worst than watchdogs Legion that stuff

2483
05:27:51,259 --> 05:28:22,669
You know why because I'm still playing this screen was fun, it's just awful in every way

2484
05:28:24,029 --> 05:28:25,869
That's so

2485
05:28:25,869 --> 05:28:38,520
It's chaotic neutral. I have green right now. I don't I don't know. I don't have a green door

2486
05:28:38,799 --> 05:28:40,000
I

2487
05:28:40,000 --> 05:28:52,970
Pair budgets with a current Ubisoft game

2488
05:28:54,090 --> 05:29:04,790
Friday the 13th. Oh, it is Friday the 13th. Maybe that's why I'm so fucked up. Is that why I'm so fucked up right now

2489
05:29:04,790 --> 05:29:07,950
I want to do this and like did they torture myself? Is this why it might be?

2490
05:29:10,080 --> 05:29:18,919
Actually really might be why yeah, this is like a scary screen screen. You're right

2491
05:29:19,479 --> 05:29:31,400
Well tomorrow's a Friday the Saturday 18th. Okay, I'm concerned now because of what I just said

2492
05:29:32,000 --> 05:29:37,840
Tomorrow's Friday the Saturday 18th tomorrow's Friday the Saturday

2493
05:29:37,840 --> 05:29:47,130
I think I'm concerned now what I tried to say was tomorrow was Saturday tomorrow was Saturday

2494
05:29:47,830 --> 05:29:51,959
For it. I don't know what I was trying to say there. What was I doing? I don't know

2495
05:29:53,000 --> 05:30:09,869
How often does a Friday the 13th come by the way is it once a year once every like few years once every few years

2496
05:30:10,270 --> 05:30:31,119
Does that happen every year happens yearly? His brain is rotting

2497
05:30:36,020 --> 05:30:38,020
Someone should check on you

2498
05:30:38,020 --> 05:30:49,770
Okay, so here is why this game is dumb. This is where you get the orb

2499
05:30:50,409 --> 05:31:09,590
These my children are crying German. I don't want to see this anymore

2500
05:31:11,310 --> 05:31:14,669
This shouldn't be here anyways, this should be studying or something

2501
05:31:15,389 --> 05:31:18,970
be

2502
05:31:18,970 --> 05:31:28,680
playing

2503
05:31:28,680 --> 05:31:34,560
Friday yeah, they should be playing should be making like a fort in the house of

2504
05:31:35,680 --> 05:31:37,689
pillows

2505
05:31:37,689 --> 05:31:39,450
mattress toppers

2506
05:31:39,450 --> 05:31:51,759
Cardboard. All right, let's get out. How do I get out of here?

2507
05:31:55,200 --> 05:32:04,340
I flew in this way. You don't I don't have to go through the maze again, right?

2508
05:32:04,459 --> 05:32:29,810
No, I can't probably just walk forward from here. I don't know why everyone hates the stream. I'm literally. Yep. Thanks

2509
05:32:29,810 --> 05:32:40,569
I have to go through I actually have to go through this. It's alright. I think I still have the

2510
05:32:42,119 --> 05:32:56,479
Escape right was it somebody give me link it to me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

2511
05:32:56,880 --> 05:32:59,880
Okay forward

forward

2513
05:33:15,340 --> 05:33:18,659
Thanks to the stream. I have a really bad toothache and watching you suffer helps

2514
05:33:19,099 --> 05:33:37,779
Well, I'm sorry about your teeth. Hope that feels better soon. Let me go left three times

2515
05:33:38,619 --> 05:34:03,220
Left again. I just fed my cat and took a shower. I thought we were on disc for we were

2516
05:34:05,180 --> 05:34:27,169
Originally one more and then we go right and forward build a Ford on stream

2517
05:34:27,630 --> 05:34:36,319
That should be kind of fun. Can you hurry up? My sister's giving birth and I kind of want to be there

2518
05:34:36,319 --> 05:34:39,919
Oh, don't worry. You're not missing much. It kind of looks like this. I

2519
05:34:48,840 --> 05:35:07,860
Made it. All right. I'm out of there now. We're gonna go back to the chamber is this way. It's for let's go

2520
05:35:07,860 --> 05:35:29,040
I got all the spheres. It's time to end this the dead

2521
05:35:29,599 --> 05:35:48,860
Unless Ted has the dead ass encounter. It's me the fucking task robot here with all the jewels

2522
05:35:49,180 --> 05:36:01,000
All right, put them in the device and let's turn on the ship and leave who dare summit me

2523
05:36:01,720 --> 05:36:15,689
Well, that was I thought it was gonna be much bigger and scarier it's a Furby it's Elmo

2524
05:36:17,150 --> 05:36:20,279
Did you summon me mr. Noor?

2525
05:36:21,540 --> 05:36:27,750
What are you summoning me for?

2526
05:36:28,029 --> 05:36:30,029
Hold on a little while

2527
05:36:36,450 --> 05:36:38,450
Put them into my sphere

2528
05:36:38,450 --> 05:36:41,409
The goals you see you're a genius

2529
05:36:55,290 --> 05:36:57,450
I'm getting a little it's getting that's turning into Eddie

2530
05:37:00,099 --> 05:37:05,729
Yeah, dude, let me try I don't have a human hand. Oh, all right, it's not me

2531
05:37:23,299 --> 05:37:30,549
Guys guys you're accidentally bowling under my name

2532
05:37:34,229 --> 05:37:38,880
My can I get to

2533
05:37:39,040 --> 05:37:41,040
slot on this thing

2534
05:37:47,970 --> 05:37:57,720
Let me do it thanks, I think Casey do it I'm the one that got them all I

2535
05:37:58,200 --> 05:38:04,040
Can't even do one. I'm the one that actually wouldn't make them all up

2536
05:38:06,759 --> 05:39:01,619
Now what I don't know go to orange door the guide says I have to get like an alien hand. I

2537
05:39:01,740 --> 05:39:15,680
Have to go get an alien hand didn't get the alien hand who will activate the final device burn

2538
05:39:16,119 --> 05:39:23,470
Yes, it was the whole thing was like a paragraph. Look, this is what it says

2539
05:39:23,950 --> 05:39:41,159
This is the end after that. This is causing me mental harm

2540
05:39:41,680 --> 05:39:48,849
But what what look why don't you just mute the stream for a minute and just go open up another tab

2541

2565
05:44:26,680 --> 05:44:50,220

2572
05:46:31,909 --> 05:46:42,360
I thought I thought I'd sit on this is it. This is the end. We've made it to the end of final cutscene on disk one

2573
05:46:43,930 --> 05:46:45,049
alien hand

2574
05:46:45,090 --> 05:46:48,900
Why did I play this for six hours?

2575
05:46:48,900 --> 05:46:54,919
This was supposed to be like a 3DO grab bag stream not die Dallas encounter full play through

2576
05:47:29,790 --> 05:47:40,270

Yes, I have one case check them out Harry. You see that. What was he disguised as a navigational console this guy?

2582
05:48:32,959 --> 05:48:36,639
I don't mind if we hijack his ship see what Casey comes up with. I shoot him

2583
05:48:37,159 --> 05:48:39,159
Looks like he's studying some kind of readout

2584
05:48:39,720 --> 05:48:42,340
Why he's adjusting those light beams?

2585
05:48:44,450 --> 05:48:52,110
What's that thing in the center? I don't know things are starting to heat up around here. Look we gotta do something we can do something now

2586
05:48:53,110 --> 05:48:59,950
Oh shit he sees us. Go for the nav consoles. I'll cover you. Wait, don't shoot it. It's unarmed. We gotta try and communicate

2587
05:48:59,950 --> 05:49:04,470
How come on this thing isn't exactly happy to see us Harry. But that's the statue guy

2588
05:49:04,470 --> 05:49:10,650
Lower your weapons Zach. Show it we mean no harm. This is like the guys. Oh, he's putting his hands up

2589
05:49:11,250 --> 05:49:14,259

2590
05:49:14,259 --> 05:49:16,880
Harry it didn't work. Get to those consoles

2591
05:49:18,080 --> 05:49:24,900
Hey, whoa, I guess we're killing it. What?

2592
05:49:37,770 --> 05:49:44,509
I shot him in his brain. Is he dead?

2593
05:49:45,229 --> 05:49:52,080
What what am I supposed to do? There's another alien?

2594
05:49:53,040 --> 05:49:56,299
There's two aliens. This is like the this is boss two

05:50:10,110 --> 05:50:12,110
Tighten the light beams

05:50:15,250 --> 05:50:25,099
What Gator what on the weapon on overload? Oh, no

05:50:34,860 --> 05:50:38,500
You took a gun to the grenade what the fuck

2610
05:52:24,689 --> 05:52:33,520
Okay, the nav console redo the other scene

Go back you have to talk to the art. Wait, I did okay go back and talk to the alien

2612
05:52:54,540 --> 05:52:56,380
Talk to the alien

05:52:56,380 --> 05:52:58,139
Talk talk to the alien

2614
05:52:58,139 --> 05:53:23,000
None of you work after the elevator ride

2615
05:53:23,000 --> 05:53:27,860
You will see a live alien when when they ask you to talk to it send four five two

2616
05:53:28,299 --> 05:53:55,500
What is four five two is okay, I have a question is this four five two, this is four five two, isn't it?

2617
05:53:55,659 --> 05:53:57,479
All right

2618
05:53:57,479 --> 05:54:18,139
Ready, how did it gain viewers?

2619
05:54:18,819 --> 05:54:24,580
Don't let them shoot it

2620
05:54:33,380 --> 05:54:41,180
I shot him in the brain his his brain just evaporate. Let's go Casey

2621
05:54:50,470 --> 05:54:52,470
Sacrifice your friends. I did that twice

2622
05:54:52,790 --> 05:55:01,250
Okay, here we go. They all fly away. We go into this room

2623
05:55:16,520 --> 05:55:21,959
It's really not that hot there is talk to it

2624
05:55:35,599 --> 05:55:37,680
I see what Casey comes up with all right talk

2625
05:55:40,799 --> 05:55:45,069
He's adjusting those light beams four five two

2626
05:55:48,220 --> 05:55:50,220
Four five two

2627
05:55:50,380 --> 05:55:52,380
Now I'm pressing a

2628
05:55:57,040 --> 05:56:02,299
No, no talk talk talk four five two, I'm pressing a communicate communicate

2629
05:56:03,520 --> 05:56:05,889
Send it. I'm hitting a

2630
05:56:20,110 --> 05:56:26,139
Something's coming out. Is it is it angry?

2631
05:56:27,700 --> 05:56:29,900
Chrysalis this is fantastic

2632
05:56:31,299 --> 05:56:33,860
We must be the first humans ever to witness this

2633
05:56:34,900 --> 05:56:36,900
Hope we don't look like appetizers

2634
05:56:37,659 --> 05:56:39,659
It's different from the other creatures. We've seen

2635
05:56:40,380 --> 05:56:43,569
Look, the other one is bowing

2636
05:56:44,330 --> 05:56:46,330
Maybe this is the new queen

2637
05:56:51,490 --> 05:56:53,490
Uncut gems music. Oh

2638
05:56:56,069 --> 05:57:11,520
I miss log the force field created by the creatures which called themselves study

2639
05:57:12,319 --> 05:57:14,360
Protected us and the ship from the intense heat

2640
05:57:15,159 --> 05:57:22,180
The cranny there fled or were destroyed when we passed through the stars Corona the newly born Queen possesses

2641
05:57:22,439 --> 05:57:25,720
race memory and incredible psychokinetic abilities

2642
05:57:26,639 --> 05:57:30,799
She improved Casey's translation abilities and then answered many of our questions

2643
05:57:30,799 --> 05:57:37,549
Why is she talking like Cartman?

2644
05:57:37,549 --> 05:57:47,720
Say void, friends. May our paths cross again. Farewell.

2645
05:58:06,720 --> 05:58:21,680
Here comes like the rock song.

2646
05:58:21,680 --> 05:58:27,840
For a second I thought Tia Carrera was a developer in the game.

2647
05:58:27,840 --> 05:58:33,540
I was like, are you serious?

2648
05:58:33,540 --> 05:58:52,770
Sorry, sorry, can you hear me now? Sorry, sorry, I'm trying to get you out.

2649
05:58:52,770 --> 05:58:57,990
Wait through the credits. You should feel ashamed of yourself for doing this.

2650
05:58:57,990 --> 05:59:04,229
Look, I feel fine. I feel great. I just feel, I just kind of have a headache now.

2651
05:59:04,229 --> 05:59:30,020
Best boy.

2652
05:59:30,020 --> 05:59:49,889
Troubles are far too greedy.

2653
05:59:49,889 --> 06:00:09,689
Cheers.

2654
06:00:09,689 --> 06:00:38,979
Time for Windows 2.0. That's very old.

2655
06:00:38,979 --> 06:00:50,900
There you think you are. Get to those consoles.

2656
06:00:50,900 --> 06:01:17,990
Did I shoot her accidentally? That's not what I wanted to do. No, that was wrong.

2657
06:01:17,990 --> 06:01:21,990
There you think you are. Get to those consoles.

2658
06:01:21,990 --> 06:01:58,689
Okay, I turned it off. I just turned it off. I turned it off. I got out.

2659
06:01:58,689 --> 06:02:04,299
Wait, the camera's on and I got no clothes on.

2660
06:02:04,299 --> 06:02:16,930
I think that's kind of where I have to end this stream. It's been six hours. I gotta go.

2661
06:02:16,930 --> 06:02:22,369
Alright, we're gonna go back to 3DO on probably Sunday.

2662
06:02:22,369 --> 06:02:28,509
One game, Andy. 3DO was your greatest mistake.

2663
06:02:28,509 --> 06:02:35,220
No, I'm playing 3DO. I love this console. I just don't, I'm playing 3DO later this weekend. I'm gonna do it.

2664
06:02:35,220 --> 06:02:40,529
We're playing Bugsnax tomorrow, and then maybe Bugsnax on Sunday. Maybe 3DO next weekend.

2665
06:02:40,529 --> 06:02:44,529
I don't know if that, there's still like, well, there's like 20 games on 3DO.

2666
06:02:44,529 --> 06:02:48,279
I just made everybody, I just tortured everybody.

2667
06:02:48,279 --> 06:02:52,279
You literally, you literally made a stream of Die Dallas Electric Boogaloo.

2668
06:02:52,279 --> 06:02:59,029
Okay. Yeah, Bugsnax is tomorrow. Yeah, I've played Demon's Souls. I don't have a PlayStation 5. I forgot it came out.

2669
06:02:59,029 --> 06:03:03,869
I didn't pre-order one. I didn't even know it came out.

2670
06:03:03,869 --> 06:03:07,110
Italics told me that it came out. I didn't even know it came out.

2671
06:03:07,110 --> 06:03:18,119
I forgot it even existed, which is fine. Don't worry, I'll get one eventually.

2672
06:03:18,119 --> 06:03:27,330
I will get one eventually, and I'll play the games on it.

2673
06:03:27,330 --> 06:03:33,869
There's only like three games on it anyways, and the first generation, the first generation of new games on a new console

2674
06:03:33,869 --> 06:03:38,869
is always, always just games that were already in development for the old console

2675
06:03:38,869 --> 06:03:41,869
that they ended up just pushing forward to the new one anyways.

2676
06:03:41,869 --> 06:03:47,669
So I'm fine for like another six months. Don't worry.

2677
06:03:47,669 --> 06:03:55,580
There's a few games that were made specifically for the PS5, but besides that, I mean, whatever.

2678
06:03:55,580 --> 06:04:03,099
I'll get it like in a few months. That's COPE. Yeah, it is.

2679
06:04:03,099 --> 06:04:07,099
All right, I'm going to send you guys to, I'm going to send you guys to Joel actually,

2680
06:04:07,099 --> 06:04:11,770
because you know what Joel is playing tonight. Joel is playing Half-Life Alyx.

2681
06:04:11,770 --> 06:04:17,889
So that's pretty pog. That's a huge pog.

2682
06:04:17,889 --> 06:04:23,990
So I'm going to send you guys to Joel. It's actually a good streamer.

2683
06:04:23,990 --> 06:04:28,169
All right, you're banned for life. I'm, I'm, no, you know what, let's go.

2684
06:04:28,169 --> 06:04:30,169
Let's go. Where's that comment? Where is it?

2685
06:04:30,169 --> 06:04:32,169
You're getting banned for life. I'm going to do it myself.

2686
06:04:32,169 --> 06:04:35,169
You're going to be the screenshot German out of five banned you for life.

2687
06:04:35,169 --> 06:04:44,810
Good ending or right? I already got the good ending. We just did it.

2688
06:04:44,810 --> 06:04:50,709
They like solved all the world's problems and we got all their like devices.

2689
06:04:50,709 --> 06:04:53,709
Let's actually, let's go make sure I didn't miss any money or anything.

2690
06:04:53,709 --> 06:04:57,919
Thanks for watching everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.

2691
06:04:57,919 --> 06:05:04,599
Tomorrow is Bugsnax. Playing that for a little bit.

2692
06:05:04,599 --> 06:05:08,599
Give a very special shout out and thank you to Sharfers, the streamer.

2693
06:05:08,599 --> 06:05:16,080
Speedruns Die Dallas encounter. The only reason why I was able to even complete the game is because he exists.

2694
06:05:16,080 --> 06:05:28,619
It's the only reason why. Without that we would have to rely on 20 year old game facts write ups.

2695
06:05:28,619 --> 06:05:40,049
The MVP. Let me minimize this though.

2696
06:05:40,049 --> 06:05:45,479
Let me minimize that. I think I X'd out of a ton of things. Hold on.

2697
06:05:45,479 --> 06:05:55,400
Yeah, I did. Just want to see if I didn't want to miss any, if there was any large bit drops or donations or anything.

2698
06:05:55,400 --> 06:06:00,049
There was. There was a shitload of community subs too.

2699
06:06:00,049 --> 06:06:07,220
We had 10 from Putrefreshen. We had 10 from Niershu. We had 10 from Anonymous.

2700
06:06:07,220 --> 06:06:12,400
We had 10 from TheWheelOfRime and then 5 from Illusiary.

2701
06:06:12,400 --> 06:06:19,849
Thanks guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for your community subs.

2702
06:06:19,849 --> 06:06:28,209
And then there was 50 bucks. There was 5,000 bits from Scrumpleton.

2703
06:06:28,209 --> 06:06:35,299
Thanks for the 50 bucks. A gigantic bit drop.

2704
06:06:41,299 --> 06:06:56,340
He wasted his ego stream on this. Yeah, I did. I did. It was in a panic. It was in a rage.

2705
06:06:56,340 --> 06:07:06,740
I need to look at this. Why is it Peter?

2706
06:07:06,740 --> 06:07:18,130
Don't go to twitch.tv slash German 985 on November 13th, 2020.

2707
06:07:18,130 --> 06:07:21,619
Worst mistake of my entire life, Lois.

2708
06:07:26,500 --> 06:07:37,619
It wasn't the worst mistake of your life. Eating the McChicken that you put in the fridge.

2709
06:07:37,619 --> 06:07:41,979
That's been an uncountable, unrememberable amount of days.

2710
06:07:41,979 --> 06:07:48,130
But you hope it was less than 5. And you eat it.

2711
06:07:48,130 --> 06:07:52,299
Was the worst mistake of your life. So don't even be cute with me.

2712
06:07:52,299 --> 06:08:00,279
Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Go say hello to Joel.

2713
06:08:00,279 --> 06:08:04,290
I played through that game. I beat Half-Life Alex. Let's see how Joel does.

2714
06:08:04,290 --> 06:08:11,759
I'll see you guys tomorrow. Good night, goodbye.

2715
06:08:11,759 --> 06:08:16,759
And thank you for joining me on a stream that a lot of people were very, very happy with.

2716
06:08:16,759 --> 06:08:19,939
I can't even fucking talk.

2717
06:08:19,939 --> 06:08:23,939
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow for Bugsnax. Eat em up.

2718
06:08:23,939 --> 06:08:27,259
Good night, guys. I'll see you tomorrow.
