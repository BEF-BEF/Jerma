1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:10,730
And I came up with a much better title in my tweet. Oh well, this was a much better one.

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:24,570
It's okay. It's too early. I'm right on time. 3 59. I just rang your doorbell.

3
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:33,700
You looked at your watch. Holy shit. I'm not going to step into your house until exactly four o'clock.

4
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,829
And hello. How are you? Hey, you ordered me. German on eight five. Hey, come on. If I come in for it,

5
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:49,270
I got to get in there exactly this time. Everyone riot. What are you doing? Don't wait. Don't be

6
00:00:49,270 --> 00:01:07,480
them. Hey, no, not right off the bat. You're an escort. Okay, I got to relax. Hey, what's going on

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:17,959
with me? Did you order me? German on eight five. Oh my God. No, it's it's me coming to your birthday.

8
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:30,760
Fuck, I can't today. They were in play no more heroes to when I've been putting off for a long

9
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:43,269
time. When did I play no more heroes? One. What do you know? I said I was going to play this

10
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:51,590
probably 200 or 300 times. Since about three months ago. Yeah. This has been the game I said

11
00:01:51,590 --> 00:02:04,329
was going to happen next week for three months. So I'm playing it. Here we are. That's based.

12
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:11,819
Vito this shit. No, if I was going to veto it, I would have vetoed. No, you can't. Not everything

13
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:19,639
in this stream is a veto. You guys get one make the streamer angry enough to turn his stream off

14
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:32,090
once every six months. That's not happening today. Beautiful Joe. I got beautiful Joe too back here.

15
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:39,900
What am I going to do with it? I'm going to have to display it on the shelf. But yeah, let's let's

16
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:48,810
get started. This is no more heroes to welcome to a new week. We had a good weekend. We should be

17
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:57,479
live here. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. All right. For a second, I saw I thought I saw

18
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:04,039
Kim's name go by doing German walk German walk and something about the Drew crew. I was like,

19
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,240
I don't even know. I don't think she even knows what that is. I was going to say what the hell

20
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:16,620
how that quickly like why is Kim doing the German walk? Anyways, let's get started. This is no more

21
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,639
heroes to welcome. We're going to play. I love this game. I don't actually remember this game

22
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,620
as much as I remember the first one. I very vividly remember though almost the whole first

23
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:43,300
game. Not this one. Let's see. Give it a look. The music is good. Yes. Oh, I know.

24
00:03:44,020 --> 00:04:01,110
We watched the opening cutscene. Should I just skip it? Don't ever skip. Once a god-forsaken city

25
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:08,699
where the bodies of angels littered the streets. Much has changed in Santa Destroy. Giant

26
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:14,379
corporations. Rampant city development. The assassin's underworld has become a commodity.

27
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,819
A chance for profit and entertainment for the masses. Colonel. But shadows from the wilder

28
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:29,620
days still linger. Or grandpa. A man who slashed his wing to the top then walked away has become

29
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:37,750
an urban legend many even doubt was real. Here, the strong devour the weak. The weak kneel before

30
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:45,750
the strong. And those who wield true power watch and count their gold. When's the third game come

31
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,230
up? And in this mass-produced savagery, one truth is constant. It's here, right? With each shattered

32
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:58,790
life, the same vow as others. I will have revenge. Tomorrow? And no assassin can ever walk away from

33
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:08,149
that. He must draw his beam and stand against the madness. This is Travis Touchdown's desperate

34
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:15,029
struggle. Hold it, you violence-loving bastard. Before you start your desperate struggling,

35
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:25,449
you should drop a nice save. Travis, I already did. What I did before the stream turned on.

36
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:34,089
Oh, I saved my game at the beginning of the stream. What happens? Well, do I have to start

37
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:54,579
back at the beginning again? Holy shit, saving in real life would suck. Why? Yes, it would.

38
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,779
Because then you would just second guess literally everything you've ever done.

39
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,790
You would have so many save files in your brain back to when you were fucking 14. Should I pick

40
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:14,740
the french fries? Or should I pick the casserole? Um, let me save it here first. And half these

41
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,259
people wouldn't delete their saves. You would accidentally load a save in your 40s. That was

42
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:24,629
from you when you were 17. And you'd just fucking wake up in like your 17, 18-year-old, 16-year-old,

43
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,540
whatever body, just like, duh, what happened? But no, but you wouldn't even remember anything.

44
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,389
Right, because that's how a save would work, right? You wouldn't remember the forward. You would just

45
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:41,540
be screaming, knowing you were going back. You'd hit the button and go back to like 14 to be like,

46
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:57,420
teenage me. I can't pick. I'm not going to sweep. I'll never forget. Quick load accidentally. Yeah.

47
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:07,779
Night for the first time in 120 years, snow fell on center destroy. It was a sign. Nice fetish.

48
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:14,980
Another change, both beautiful and deadly. Making a shitload of save files in your head is

49
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:32,500
what? Yeah, you guys would not want that. You would retake your driver's test a thousand times

50
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,459
to make sure you got an S rating on it. You don't think of everything you've ever done and how many

51
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:43,620
times you've gone back to save points to fix even, even like the smallest thing. I didn't do that

52
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,459
good enough. I'm going to restart that. I could get like 10 more EXPs. It's called fashionably late

53
00:07:47,459 --> 00:08:00,730
fuckface Travis touchdown. This place bring back any memories. It's only where my last killing spree

54
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:08,660
started. All those screwed up with that one. Now, why would I remember that? It'll be your blood this

55
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:17,699
time when I avenge my brother draw. That's cool. And who don't you remember the man you fought here?

56
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,990
Um, no, can't say I do. Guess he didn't make an impression. It must have been crazy weak.

57
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:33,029
You insensitive prick. You killed him and you don't even remember. You know how humiliating that is.

58
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:44,230
Sorry, I don't have a death diary. And in case you're wondering, I'm even stronger now. You will

59
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,429
lose. You've got no chance of winning this.

60
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,590
You're something else. I haven't been. It's been too long Travis.

61
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,070
When you see your bro in hell, tell him he's still a douche.

62
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:18,629
There we go. High strike, low strike. I like the scenery of be as high strike attack,

63
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,440
up or down.

64
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,320
Z is lock on, right?

65
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,759
Uh, beam katana recharge to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

66
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,809
I don't think I need it right now. Okay, emergency. Yeah, there's a dodge.

67
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,379
Why is he not doing it?

68
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,019
Oh, yes. I remember how much fun it was.

69
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,070
Swing the remote while running is a running slash. Yeah.

70
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:17,669
This guy sucks. Reset the camera.

71
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,269
Oh, the batteries on the other side. Right. Right. Right. Right.

72
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,759
Button mashing recover from take down. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

73
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:41,720
Take so much longer in this one. What? Oh my God. It takes forever.

74
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,220
I don't remember it taking that long. What the fuck?

75
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:54,659
Press B when you're down enemy. Yeah.

76
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:13,240
Just reload your save side. You know, many times I would restart streams.

77
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,539
I was like, think about how many times you've taken a Photoshop of my face.

78
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:22,980
I've taken a screenshot of my face. I would have just, I would just have like every five minutes,

79
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,970
a quick save. It would take me like six hours to stream three hours.

80
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,419
Then you'd be kind of boring though. Wouldn't add, wouldn't I? If I went back and corrected

81
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,659
every dumb thing I've ever said on every stream, I would just kind of just,

82
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:55,419
your experience would just kind of be like this. There's a door. Number 13. Excellent choice.

83
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:28,120
But there's a guy over here on the right. Stream scumming. Oh God.

84
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:39,379
Where did that cigarette? By the way, what's with the filter on that cigarette? It's half the

85
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:50,149
cigarette. So what should I tell you this time? Extra filter. It means it's less bad for you.

86
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:58,580
At some points, everyone's getting ripped off paying for filters.

87
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:26,230
This is me on the phone. Nice porn game. It's a dumb cut scene.

88
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,899
Oh, king of space. Oh, we're still going.

89
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Oh, you got a gun. He has a gun.

90
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,509
Oh, that sounds like a stream scum. That did kind of sound like a stream scum.

91
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:08,789
I already did it. You guys don't know. What you guys don't know is I've lost this fight

92
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:14,309
35 times in a row, but you'll never know because I've just been stream scumming.

93
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:21,419
Remember that time that I beat all those Dark Souls bosses on the first try?

94
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:29,639
No, those were 200 and 300 attempts. But I have to make it believable. So I have to like lose

95
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,080
a bunch on some of them and then stream scum half of them. So then you think I'm like, okay.

96
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:58,840
There goes his head. That was Jevil. It landed right then. Gelter Helter.

97
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:07,419
Yeah, dead. Somebody gave a hundred bucks at the beginning of this. Like to address it.

98
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:22,340
Right after this cut scene. Oh, it's this lady again.

99
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,639
Does that quick a turn around on everything that's happened since the last game?

100
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,200
We're not going to be satisfied until you do, right? Oh, give me a break.

101
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,840
We're going to get a recap from the sequel who don't care about continuity. You know,

102
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,519
besides it would take forever if I recap every detail of your fall from greatness.

103
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:14,360
Players would skip it. It's so boring. Well, I guess you got a point there.

104
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,159
Yeah. Yeah. That's what I do.

105
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,519
What is a scam in the last game?

106
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:51,320
from rank 51 this time, more competition. The last game success made assassination

107
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,799
trendy. Yeah. But I already fought my way to number one before.

108
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:02,120
Shouldn't I get a special fast track to the title fight? No, but you will get a special prize.

109
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:11,059
Shut up. You can't bribe me this time. I've already trusted those goods,

110
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:14,900
but just a test. This time you'll get the five course meal.

111
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:27,210
Five course. Wait, I don't get what that means. Did you know I am a yoga? You don't say.

112
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:37,819
Are you familiar with any yoga positions? Like a down downward dog. The dog can do all sorts of

113
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:50,809
things. So Kenzie Cobra, the rabbit, Cobra, rabbit, rabbit. Hold on. Oh yeah. I'm in it to win baby.

114
00:17:50,809 --> 00:18:06,309
Number one. Here I come. Hey, but he's still alive. I got a message for you. Oh my, he's still alive.

115
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:13,900
Pain in my ass. Why aren't you dead yet? Such blind arrogance like the naked emperor.

116
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,660
It was in connect.

117
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:52,339
I'd love for there to be another camera shot of the cameraman down here

118
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,980
during this just spinning around in circles with a fucking camera.

119
00:18:55,859 --> 00:19:01,700
Now it's your turn to be burdened with another's death. It has destroyed me

120
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,140
and it will destroy you too. This is the ultimate vengeance.

121
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:35,829
That ruins the illusion. Yeah, it's supposed to. Porn and gore. Yeah, they like stab each other and

122
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:42,789
cut each other's faces. There's going to be some blood. There's no porn here though. That part

123
00:19:42,789 --> 00:20:03,079
you're wrong. Help you find something. Yeah. We're the fucking super Mario cart. You never have

124
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:17,160
fucking copies of this shit. We're just here to collect Travis. Got like 20 Madden's, but only

125
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:40,299
four. You guys can do better than that. Madden Madden 96. What the fuck just happened? That was

126
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:47,019
always such a pain in the ass though. You'd go to a place like Blockbuster and they have the same

127
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:54,140
game that nobody wants. Taken up two full shelves and they're all in there. There's not one that's

128
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,980
taken. Not one's been rented out. And you're just like, well, come on, you can't, there's gotta be,

129
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:05,500
you can't give me more of these that are being actually rented. This is Scott Pilgrim game.

130
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:27,339
All right. Are you saying that because there's retro video game beep sounds. Hey, you can tell

131
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:33,000
when this is going out of style. Like right now, when you start seeing this shit in car commercials

132
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:39,700
and insurance commercials, how many times have you heard the like regular Nintendo sound?

133
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,680
That's how you can tell it. Oh, we, oh, we got it. This is going out of style.

134
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:54,259
Turbo tax. You guys, you never heard that before? You haven't seen that in,

135
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:10,089
I've, I've seen it. I haven't seen a commercial in years.

136
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,069
He gets a notification on his phone from Amazon. Your package has been delivered.

137
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,269
There's a photo to prove it. It's just your shattered fucking window.

138
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,630
I can't even pay attention to the story.

139
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:31,109
Swords ultraviolence to purge their souls of the hatred that blighted them.

140
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:42,230
A lot of cigarettes put out over there. See, she's got to smoke way more because the filters are too

141
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:52,920
big. I have set up the next, are you get his, just give me someone to fight. You sound passionate.

142
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:59,799
What's gotten into you subtitles on someone kill Bishop. I understand. I will, if I, you know,

143
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:12,279
you have a girlfriend, why are you playing this? Wait, you mean like, why, why am I streaming when

144
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:26,680
I have a girlfriend? What are you talking about? Do I have any shirts? I do. Okay. Let's get some

145
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:38,730
good clothes. I can't see it because of the jacket. I don't know what that, I was about to,

146
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:49,259
I don't know what that is. I want a different jacket and I have to buy it. This is the only

147
00:24:49,259 --> 00:25:01,210
pants. Yep. Is the only everything. The volume up. Okay. There you go. You should be able to hear

148
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:14,650
sound. Perfect. That's way too loud. That was a, yeah. I put it back down where it was. Sorry,

149
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:27,690
one guy. Okay. Hold on. This is important. At a Reddit shelf over there. Or does that not count?

150
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:44,440
It doesn't count. This is a Reddit shelf. So what's the difference? This is what you would

151
00:25:44,440 --> 00:26:01,660
consider. No, it's not. How am I saying no? It's the shelf. Jean's getting way too fat. Try to get

152
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:09,180
her to lose some weight. Making Jean go on a diet will put her in a foul mood. Dieting in a bad mood

153
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:15,339
will lower the effectiveness of the diet. Give her a snack from time to time. Jean doesn't like

154
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:19,819
doing the same things over and over. So once a menu has been selected, it won't be available for a

155
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:31,900
while. Okay. 24 pounds. All right. Let's do some jumps. Come on. 62 centimeters.

156
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:55,500
121 centimeters. Let's try again. 180. 240. One more. Yes. 300.

157
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:06,700
Jean. Yeah. That's got to do it. All right. Good. Now we give a treat. Stretch. All right.

158
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:23,130
Oh, no, no, no. Holy shit. This guy has a fucking walrus. Stop. You're killing it.

159
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,450
Those are just sound effects.

160
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:47,930
Okay. Now we need to feed. Here. Only the only premium food for my,

161
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:54,539
for my little darling. I don't have any money. Oh shit. I can't feed my cat.

162
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:17,259
Stop. Okay. Am I petting the cat or is the cat a bear against the tree with a really itchy

163
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:44,680
back? Much better mood. I feel like that you get fucking scratched. What is this?

164
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:54,150
What is this link? Oh my God. How did you get that? How did you do that?

165
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:13,079
How did you get it that quickly? Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. I'll show it in a second. Hold on.

166
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:22,650
Oh, nice. This isn't even from this stream. Oh, it's just the thing. Get it.

167
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:41,660
Yeah. Lost 0.3 pounds mood. It's all right. I don't, I can't. Okay. Let's get,

168
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:50,650
I need to get money for food. All right. First and foremost, we had 10,000 bits come in from

169
00:29:50,650 --> 00:30:02,019
gimme $20. 100 bucks from gimme 20. Thanks for the 10,000 bits gimme $20. They say I rewatched

170
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:06,819
you through the ages stream and it still cracks me up. Please do another one soon. Watching you

171
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:11,299
cringe at your old content was hilarious. Also, the original Night of the Living Dead is public

172
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:16,339
domain. You need something for the next movie night. Yes, we will be watching that one.

173
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,299
Um, no, that was a ton of fun. Trust me when I say that this stuff like that pops up all the time.

174
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:31,259
And I just kind of have to jump on him if I want to do my right. I okay. That's not good.

175
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:39,670
God damn it. Viscera fucking cleanup detail. I just had a flashback. Uh, okay.

176
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,480
I just, I saw everybody saying spill joke, spill joke, spill joke, spill joke.

177
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,920
Just like there it is. It's right there. Okay. Let's see.

178
00:30:49,799 --> 00:31:12,819
Spill joke. So funny. Spill joke. Let's do our first assignment on the subtitles.

179
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:20,420
Let's actually. Yeah. Subtitles on minimap on. Don't invert the camera.

180
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:33,960
Okay. More bits. Holy shit. More bits did come in. $50 from phylactery lich. Thanks for the 5,000

181
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:41,579
bits. What just happened to my game? Oh, okay. Okay. I was just, what the fuck is going on?

182
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:49,380
What just happened? Wait, why did this happen? Oh, cause the TV. Oh, okay. We're gonna start

183
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:54,900
bizarre Jerry and Joe. What is this? Like a, this is like the generic brand of medicine for Jojo's

184
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:08,069
bizarre adventure. It's our Jerry. Uh, uh, phylactery gave 5,000 bits. Remember the whole

185
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:11,829
point of this game is that Travis is a loser. Don't try and relate to him. It's embarrassing.

186
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:36,420
Nice porn game. Wait, what is, what the hell is, what am I playing? Wait, this is, I played this.

187
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:42,710
This is the other one. There it is. I don't have to play that. I don't have to do it anymore.

188
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:53,140
Everybody, the one person that's been begging me to play to Joe Joe. Now I don't ever have to do it

189
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:16,180
ever again. Yeah. Here it is. Right. He's lazy. Sure. Of course. Don't wait. Don't you let that

190
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:21,910
long to figure out that I need to do minimal effort for maximum gain. It's not even true.

191
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:42,329
Oh, maximum game. This one's locked. I'm not even looking.

192
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:52,789
Don't you have like bombs in these games? What's the button that I pressed that the screen fills

193
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:58,789
with a red circle and kills everything that hits the circle? Where's that button? It's in all of

194
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:28,230
these. Dude, you're losing viewers. Oh, fuck. What do I do? Fuck. Is this, I want to find a boss.

195
00:34:40,889 --> 00:35:05,500
No, I'm alive. Holy shit. It's Miku. Who's Miku? Boss time. Let's go. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

196
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:47,909
I know what that is. I know what that is. I'm all right. It's a fucking game. It's a fucking

197
00:35:47,909 --> 00:36:03,190
pretend game. Why do I care that much? All right. Just beat Toho on screen. Wait, what? I did AA.

198
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:12,489
Bizarre Jerry. That was fun. I'll probably never open that again.

199
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:27,780
Wait, got pure white love of Bizarre Jerry 5 video. What was that? Don't watch it. Don't wait. Why?

200
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:48,579
Are you serious? Are you serious? Should I turn it off? I don't know what this is. What do you mean?

201
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:58,389
I got one guide. It's not TOS. It's not TOS. People were saying TOS, dude. I'm like, what do

202
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:13,000
you want to do? Go. Oh, let's just watch it. Yo, TOS, dude. I want an apology every 20 minutes.

203
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:25,860
Oh, all right. I'll watch it later. Side job. It's horror time. Oh, God is now available.

204
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:33,639
Oh, I thought that was the side job. I was like, wow, that's okay. Lay the pipe is now available.

205
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,079
Oh, that's right. They got rid of the driving because everybody hated it so much in the first

206
00:37:43,079 --> 00:38:05,210
game. Wow. I forgot you're going to go to burger soup. Am I strong enough to do this?

207
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:16,550
Now it has to get minus a letter grade. No, that's true. You're right. Is a shopkeeper Sylvia.

208
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:21,909
I want to make a deal. I'll conquer the rankings, fight whoever it takes. And in return,

209
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:31,500
you assholes who kill calm down. You shouldn't make this personal. It is the quickest way to

210
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:39,099
lose a battle. This isn't a battle anymore. It's a motherfucking war. Fine. It makes no difference.

211
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,179
The mastermind behind Bishop's death is the owner of pizza bed, this building,

212
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,139
most of the city. He is the head of the corporation that runs it all.

213
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:54,539
Listen, you see the whole jumping around from building to building. And as fate would have it,

214
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:58,780
he is also the number one assassin. You better not be lying.

215
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:07,500
It is a fact. The object of your game cube rendered wonderfully convenient. Don't you think?

216
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:15,739
Sure is. There's a new hotel on the beach. The 50th ranked assassin is waiting for you there.

217
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,460
By the way, that junior owns that hotel too. He really is everywhere, huh?

218
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:29,179
No, there are 50 other fighters trying to kill him. You have no time to waste.

219
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:31,820
Oh, we're definitely not going to have to fight 50 boss fights.

220
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:41,559
And what's the hell I'm going to raise. I kind of miss the guitar.

221
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:51,690
Taking advantage of people's sorrows. He used his music to lure followers.

222
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:59,190
He spoke of a grand faith, but his words were hollow. It was all to satisfy his own goal.

223
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:05,269
He'd only found success because of strong financial support from the new mafia

224
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,940
who used his pulpit to gain support for their own agenda.

225
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,539
Someone is a hundred times hornier than the last one. Jesus Christ.

226
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:19,019
But the real goal that drove him? That's a secret.

227
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:40,059
Camera's free. Get out of portrait mode, please.

228
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:51,289
Okay. This is ranking. Let's go to the side job one. There's nothing wrong with no more

229
00:40:51,289 --> 00:41:01,380
heroes being horny. All right. Bug time. So pizza bats offering you the job of a lifetime

230
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:09,590
hardcore exterminator. Chicks love bug killers even more than doctors and pro athletes.

231
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:14,659
It's a little known fact. Terminate all the bugs in the stage within the time limit.

232
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:18,179
You can suck in blocks if you power up enough.

233
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,579
Giant enemy scorpions cannot be sucked unless you are at full power.

234
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:43,800
Oh, they did. They changed this too, right? Now I remember all the mini games are not actually.

235
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:51,539
Uh huh. Right. Okay. Here we go. So V is insecticide, A is suck in.

236
00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:00,920
Let's go. Yeah. They made them all like regular Nintendo games.

237
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:14,280
It's more fun this way. I don't let you say that. And then I just got killed.

238
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:31,110
No more coconuts. Music's really, really good. This is really good. Can you suck up a mouse?

239
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:51,530
Oh, shit. Those are bugs. Those are mice. Come here. 800, 400, $4,800.

240
00:42:54,059 --> 00:43:06,809
Mm hmm. You can't kill scorpions. Can I suck up these? You guys, you guys seen these devices

241
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:12,460
that'll like this? Where it's a little vacuum cleaner that you press onto the wall and suck

242
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:30,710
the bug up. It's like a tiny little sucker for spiders on your wall. Oh, wait, hold on.

243
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:38,260
That's insecticide. I don't need it yet. Oh, wait. No, you're talking about up here.

244
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:46,260
This is, this is papaya's theme. This is, this is bone works. What's this? It's the exact same song.

245
00:43:53,139 --> 00:44:28,230
Holy shit. I wanted to hear it again. I mean, it was different. $11,300.

246
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:50,809
What? Oh man. What's this one too? This is another one.

247
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:18,019
What is it? I've heard this. Get them all quick. 21. Every single song is from Undertale.

248
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah, all music is Undertale. All games with soundtracks are Undertale.

249
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:56,760
E in that piss bucket up there. What are these tools? Is this extra money? I'm,

250
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:03,480
ooh. Whoa. Oh, these dolls are lobsters. I can't. What did I just do? That's a grenade.

251
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:15,460
Okay. Kill. Tuck it up. Tuck it up. Tuck it up. Oh, all right. Do it again. No,

252
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,340
shit. I didn't mean to do that. All right. This is, wait, this is a super grenade right here.

253
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:40,809
Wait, I can suck this up. Oh, you idiot. Get it? Okay. Now I need, uh, can I pick up another one?

254
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:52,389
It's more fun than the actual game. What does this battery do?

255
00:46:54,949 --> 00:47:04,579
Oh, do I have full power? Does it matter anymore? Can I suck up scorpions? Oh yeah. That's right.

256
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:16,250
It's full power. Can I get him? He's huge. I can't get him. Just grenade him. What am I doing?

257
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:47,019
What am I doing? Why couldn't I get him? Grenade. Let's go. Okay. 1920. All right. Let's kill this

258
00:47:47,019 --> 00:48:15,300
guy. Don't be mean. He's trying his best. I wasn't not even close. I mean, no, not even close. Dude,

259
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,219
am I making just a bunch of money? This is cool. Am I just making a ton of money? Why is it not

260
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:44,329
stopping me? Oh, can't suck those up. You made three dollars. Oh, come on. I tried to,

261
00:48:44,329 --> 00:49:02,679
he just turned in a weird way. I died to a grasshopper. LOL. LOL. LOL. Thank you.

262
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:13,000
It's too many. Oh, fuck. Can I get him? What just happened? Am I poisoned? Why do I need the

263
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:35,030
antidote? What just killed me? Let's go. Oh, I lost. Okay. And how much money did I make?

264
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:52,019
How much money did I make? What do you mean zero? How do you make zero? What? Wait, because I,

265
00:49:54,809 --> 00:50:05,369
you lost it all. Oh, so you have to retire before it's like, um, who wants to be a millionaire?

266
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:15,860
I get it. Okay. I do some plumbing. We'll pay you handsomely. Connect the exit to the entrance

267
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,699
using pipes within the time limit. Blue pipes can be moved, but not green pipes.

268
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:33,530
More pipes you connect, the more money you get. Here we go. Play the pipe. Lift, turn, move.

269
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:52,460
Easy. Let's go. Oh, nevermind. I don't, I hate these. Oh, I hate these. Where's it going?

270
00:50:53,659 --> 00:51:00,940
Oh shit. It's go, I gotta get into the green pipe. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No. How am I

271
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:17,769
supposed to get this one? No, you go like this. How the fuck do I get out? Shit. No, get out of the

272
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:41,849
way. I need one of the, I need this. I need, get over here. Wait, wait, wait. No, it said, oh no,

273
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:47,610
listen. Listen, it said to connect the green ones and then it go up. I'm going to get more points,

274
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:56,019
guys. Everyone's like, holy shit, his brain. Oh, his brain is, oh no. I think something

275
00:51:56,019 --> 00:52:01,260
wrong with his brain. No, his brain is fine. He's doing what he's supposed to be doing.

276
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:24,760
Oh my God. Oh my God. His brain. Guys, something wrong with his brain. Check this shit out. Oh,

277
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:38,469
yeah. Look at this shit. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Wait, what if I do something crazy?

278
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:47,139
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Out of my way. Out of my fucking way. Get out of my way. I gotta

279
00:52:47,139 --> 00:53:00,760
move this. I need that piece down there. Wait, get, get out of my fucking way, please.

280
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:16,739
Oh no, his brain. What's wrong with his mind? Check this shit out. Look at how many of these I'm

281
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:25,030
going to hit. And please fill it up. I hit so many greens. Everyone thought I was crazy.

282
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:51,829
And it's $700. Why is it taking taxes out? I went over on the left. Wait a minute. Yeah.

283
00:53:51,829 --> 00:54:25,909
Yeah. This is fun. Yeah. Look at this cool, fun thing. Let's do, I need, I need clear time.

284
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:42,460
Is he having fun? Yeah, I'm having a ton of fun. Look at how fun this is. Okay. I'm just going to,

285
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:57,800
should I finish it or should I go for the, go for gold here? Okay. What if I do this? Should I just,

286
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,940
I go down and then around? Okay. I'm going to go like this. Okay. Right. That's what I'm going to do.

287
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:14,059
All right. I got it. Hold on. Move this. I got, God damn it. Hold on. He's got a Reddit brain.

288
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:19,530
I don't give a shit. I'm just having fun. All right. I got to move this stuff out of the way.

289
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:28,099
Cause I won't be able to get back over here. It's not blocking me in. I need these puzzles.

290
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:40,039
This is why you get this done first. All right. I need one of these. I'm going to go. God damn it.

291
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:51,619
I have to fuck. I need to get over here. Okay. Something was going on with his brain.

292
00:55:53,340 --> 00:56:15,989
Uh, dude, check his brain. This is check his brain. I have enough. I have too many of these

293
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:37,909
straight ones. Fuck. Okay. Hold on. I can fix this, right? I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it.

294
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:45,159
I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it. Yeah. All right. Now go.

295
00:56:47,349 --> 00:57:04,420
I got it. I got it. I got it. I fixed it. I got it. No, this is good. Hurry up. Oh, fuck. I have to,

296
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:10,389
I'm stuck in here. How do I do this? I need another set of hands. I need somebody else's hands.

297
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:13,349
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I forgot. I can just take the wall down. Okay. Well, good,

298
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:34,380
good, good, good, good. Hey, look at that. I did it. I used every single piece. Fucking brain.

299
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:54,679
What about his brain? Is he okay? Let's get those tactics out. Here we go. Fast.

300
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:02,659
Put all the pieces in the right. And I'm doing peace management right now.

301
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:11,420
Oh, it's already here. It's already here. It's already there. It's already there. It's already

302
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:39,510
there. It's already there. And then, and then we got to go, uh, this, like this. Shit. Yes.

303
00:58:40,309 --> 00:59:06,460
And like this way and then that way. And then check this out. Other way. It's too fucking late

304
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:21,210
now. It's too late. This is what I'm working with. And then we go like this. I, I, what are you

305
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:25,900
talking about? I fucked it. What are you talking about? How is it fucked? What are you talking

306
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:46,139
about? How? How is this fucked? How is this fucked up? It's fine. And this goes up all the

307
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:55,420
way through here. Yeah. How is this fucked up? Is this correct? I did it right. Oh,

308
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:16,150
oh, look at all these naysayers. Everybody said I blew it. That's actually the dumb one.

309
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:33,480
Okay. I think I call it here, right? That's $25,000. I'm done. If I lose, I lose it all.

310
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:55,880
Let's go to the gym. Oh yeah. I got to get the cat food and let's do our first training.

311
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,920
I haven't even played one mission yet and I'm just, it's just fun. Hey there, Mr. I can tell

312
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,360
it's your first time. Don't worry. We'll have fun breaking in. Just tell me what you want to focus

313
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:13,530
on. Uh, stamina. How much money do I have? 71, stamina. Yes. I'm ready. Stay in shape by using

314
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:24,329
the treadmill. Press the C and B button alternatively. Ready, set, go. Oh, this is cool.

315
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:45,579
What happened? I run off the treadmill. Turn it on, man. You don't say three, two, one, go. And

316
01:01:45,579 --> 01:01:51,380
then tell me you're going to turn it on and just don't. I was of the opinion that I had to outrun

317
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:55,059
the treadmill thing because of how fast it was going to be going at cartoon speeds.

318
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:09,130
Can I just lose $2,000? I ran the wrong way. Wait, why am I facing this way? What are you talking

319
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:20,760
about? Oh, I didn't think you could change a treadmill's direction. I thought those things

320
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:47,769
in the bottom were just LEDs. Make it look cool, but faster. No, why? What? Somebody said what?

321
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:52,969
Where? Where brain stamina increased? Okay. What's that one?

322
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:09,260
Muscle. How fast can I tap the button? Up with the control stick. Let's do it.

323
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:24,739
Is there a jump? I would, I didn't look. How am I not ducking?

324
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:39,780
Wait, what? I didn't want to catch his kisses. Catching with my brain.

325
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:53,610
I got hit by a dumbbell. I thought I had to duck. Hey, near shoe, thanks for the $5,000.

326
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:13,449
Yeah, use your forehead to block the weights. Is this happy Gilmore? I get it now.

327
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:26,070
Party time. Oh, this dude has no fucking rhythm. Have you said, dude, you see this guy play

328
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:44,940
catapult? He's fucking socks at everything. It's gonna be real fun when I play the actual video.

329
01:04:44,940 --> 01:05:02,869
Whoa. Attack power increased. Whatever that word is. All right, dude, hurry up and kill someone.

330
01:05:03,909 --> 01:05:09,480
Not all about violence. God, some of you guys only care about the violence.

331
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:23,349
All right, we've done everything. Let's go back to the motel because I'm going to feed the cat.

332
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:27,750
Otherwise, this whole chat is going to revolt against me and I won't, I will not be able to

333
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:44,739
stream ever again because I didn't feed the cat. I feed premium quality cat food. Only the best.

334
01:05:53,239 --> 01:06:08,010
She's happy. That's why the cat is fat, but we can maintain. We can maintain. All right, here we go.

335
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:20,389
Wait, there's so much to do right at the very beginning. Watch the fucking video. I will. I've

336
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:28,139
got to play the first mission of the game. It's been an hour. Travis effing touchdown. I've

337
01:06:28,139 --> 01:06:34,119
been seeing you since my last door was closed. Take your time. All right, I want a new jacket.

338
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:46,380
I don't want to be default Travis touchdown. This is a different style. I don't want this one.

339
01:06:49,780 --> 01:07:02,780
New old school. What about any different pants? I don't like these. What? Never mind.

340
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:17,130
Did you guys check on your desk? Well, I think it's stuck. Oh, hit the top of your city player.

341
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:30,389
Okay. That's just like, it was this one time when I was in college where there was somebody

342
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:37,030
in the dormitories, right? Everyone. We all shared space, right? It was,

343
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:41,349
it was a line of doors and we lived with somebody. Maybe you had a roommate, maybe you didn't. Maybe

344
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:48,869
you had a solo room, whatever. Um, but on my, on my area where I lived on campus,

345
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:57,030
one time this dude had it just, he left his room. He always listened to music very loudly

346
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:05,349
and he left his room one day and the door obviously locking his door and left his music on

347
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:11,510
like blaring really fucking loud. But the problem was the CD or something got stuck

348
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:22,170
so it was just going over and over for like fucking 30 straight minutes until like the building

349
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:27,449
manager had to come and like, and, and fucking open his door because he was gone for like four

350
01:08:27,449 --> 01:08:30,970
hours at that point. And it was, everyone was just like, this is driving us fucking crazy.

351
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:46,619
Like the campus, like police had to like get involved. It was fucking insane. Where's the

352
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:59,100
video of that? I don't have a recording of this, but I just kept laughing my ass off.

353
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:04,460
Cause it, I mean, it was really fucking annoying, but at the same time, it's just, it was so funny

354
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:30,710
because it's like, what do you do? It's like a locked door. What the fuck are you doing, man?

355
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:38,840
Ooh, new music. Now I can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about me sitting there

356
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:51,479
and how funny I thought this was. C or two switch target. It's kind of hard to do that.

357
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:04,600
You fucking asshole. I missed it. Tiger on the bottom right of the screen is the ecstasy gauge.

358
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:09,880
The gauge will increase each time you attack an enemy. The gauge will decrease each time you get

359
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:17,079
hit. When your gauge goes up and the tiger turns red and connect your slash combos longer

360
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:25,130
and activate the high speed slash attack mode by pressing the minus. Okay.

361
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:52,979
Here's the boys looking for blood. You still here? You get what you're looking for? His

362
01:10:52,979 --> 01:11:07,140
head exploded. He fucking exploded. Yeah, I know. It's pog, huh? Am I just holding the button wrong?

363
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:23,050
Oh, you're right. You can turn into the tiger. Holy shit. I forgot about this. Kill everyone.

364
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:43,899
Oh, letter grade. This is not a car. It's basically a car. Well, I mean, it kind of

365
01:11:44,939 --> 01:12:04,439
is the gauge increased. Money. I like this song too. All right, let's go.

366
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,020
It's the title theme. All right. I have a superpower.

367
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:43,460
Oh, it's you. Okay. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Stop. I'm blocking the stuff looking.

368
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:13,819
They even say that in this game. They have to, right? There's no way they don't. Got a guitar?

369
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:54,489
Okay. Yes. His voice is so good. He has a fantastic screaming voice. This is so much behind him.

370
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:23,939
I carved that fucking guy up. Battery. Wait. Oh, come on. Really?

371
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:45,100
Okay. I don't think they're here right now. Of course they are. They're always here.

372
01:14:56,630 --> 01:15:03,960
Oh, too bad they didn't do it three times. Oh, yes. I love it when you hit more than two or three.

373
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:22,600
Get him. Yeah, it's the medic. It is the medic's voice actor. Robin Atkin Downs.

374
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,479
The name of the actor. Very talented. Very, very, very good at what they do.

375
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:52,300
Why are we here? Come on. I need three in a row. I'm not satisfied without three.

376
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:59,850
Nice.

377
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:21,050
It really is too bad. There's no more. Are you prepared?

378
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:48,569
Battery card. You're a pain.

379
01:16:48,569 --> 01:17:06,359
You're all very on the shortcake. Here comes another one. You? You're still alive?

380
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:20,180
There's more than one enemy type in this one. Yeah, there is. All right. Anything else?

381
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:34,779
It's over here. No. I thought I just missed something. Okay. Let's go.

382
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:48,840
Am I going to scream Minecraft today? You know, I was thinking about it. I came to the determination

383
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:55,880
that I don't think so. No. I was thinking about it, though. A few hours ago, I was like, yeah,

384
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:07,750
that's probably... No. I was like, Travis Touchdown. I won't let him lie to you. I won't let him lie to

385
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:29,420
you. This must be karma. Travis Touchdown. Spare me the mystic crap. I came here to fight.

386
01:18:31,899 --> 01:18:53,939
What the fuck? Oh my God. I see the rumors were true. I don't know who's talking about me,

387
01:18:54,739 --> 01:19:00,579
but that nickname's all right. Listen to me, your highness. These rankings mean nothing to me.

388
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:06,739
Neither does my sect or the mom. My only true calling was to clash swords with you.

389
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:14,180
That's why I joined this contest. I was starving for a worthy fool. Then you're in luck,

390
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:19,539
because I'm as worthy as it gets, and I've got a shit ton of anger to work out.

391
01:19:19,539 --> 01:19:26,819
That's what I like to hear. This is it. This is what I've been praying for. I'm weary of this

392
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:36,420
guilty world. Oh, glitter. No soul. Save me from sorrow, crownless king. Thy sword and thy wrath

393
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:43,380
will deliver me. You should go easy on that crazy punch. How about I just cut you a new one?

394
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:50,340
We'll both do as divinity commands. Here we go. First boss. Hallelujah. Here we go.

395
01:19:50,979 --> 01:20:13,050
Oh, I have no more battery. Battery. What are you doing? What the hell was that? Battery.

396
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:20,310
It takes so much longer in this one.

397
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:47,779
Good. It's two. Oh, fuck. All right, hold on. Back up. Shit's out of battery already again.

398
01:20:51,180 --> 01:21:13,850
Run. The world is being destroyed. It don't matter. Oh, it's dead again. I'm trying to.

399
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,010
What the hell are you doing?

400
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:31,029
Get it. Get the fuck in there. Oh, shit.

401
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:50,250
Like this rock is with an air blast.

402
01:21:50,250 --> 01:22:31,020
Damn it. Okay. All right, here we go. Let's go. Let's go. Chandelier. Chandelier's down.

403
01:22:31,020 --> 01:23:04,340
All right, don't get hit. H3.

404
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:23,100
Oh, no, no.

405
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:36,729
Break it. I can't break these fucking huge. Battery.

406
01:23:40,260 --> 01:24:02,710
Extra crank. Shit's dead. To keep blessing himself. I can't.

407
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:21,800
Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's go.

408
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:38,100
Oh, don't do that. Watch out for the laser. Don't get hit by a laser. Oh, dear. He's got more shit.

409
01:24:38,100 --> 01:25:14,199
Shit. He's camping. Oh, you dick. What the fuck? He just hit manned me. He just did a hit man trap.

410
01:25:14,199 --> 01:25:31,739
How did I fall for that? Don't block it. Nobody ever uses the chandelier move and hit man because

411
01:25:31,739 --> 01:26:01,159
it's so obvious. I'm the one that fell for it. This battery sucks. Damn it. I'm gonna die.

412
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:31,029
Yeah, I agree. Oh, my God. I can't even move. Dude. Shit. Done. Fuck. Oh, no. He's got a plant.

413
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:57,689
I don't want to do this. I don't want to have an explode on me. This is fucking horrible.

414
01:26:57,689 --> 01:27:15,029
Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Get him and grab him. Grab him. Why did I fucking grab him? No. No.

415
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:39,829
Die. Just die. I win. That was all over the place. Oh, my God. He beat the first boss.

416
01:27:41,270 --> 01:28:01,220
Do you want a cookie? How many scums was that? You'll never know. Captain Nemo,

417
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:11,979
thanks for the 5,000 bits. $50. I just got a big ass unemployment check. So I figured

418
01:28:11,979 --> 01:28:20,100
I'd stimulate the economy. Go get yourself some McChickens. It's a lot of money.

419
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:28,899
When are you gonna do Rat Movie 3? I don't know. Tomorrow? Never? Somewhere between there.

420
01:28:35,699 --> 01:29:03,340
I can't fucking wait. The job's in the... Rat Movie 3 date confirmed. You heard it here first,

421
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:10,779
guys. Spread the news. Yeah, it'll be somewhere between tomorrow and the day that I die.

422
01:29:12,949 --> 01:29:37,060
Hopefully somewhere in the low hundreds. I'm really shooting for 110 to 120. You're not

423
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:55,260
gonna make it to 80, man. Who am I killing? I afforded the directions to your map. I'm busy,

424
01:29:55,260 --> 01:30:19,430
so hurry up. Gotcha. Okay. It happened again. Spill joke. What's on the shelf?

425
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:31,109
Another $50 just came in. Watch the anime. I got a backlog of animes to watch. I'll watch it

426
01:30:31,109 --> 01:30:43,029
eventually. A one true roadie thanks to the $50. I haven't been able to catch many streams lately

427
01:30:43,029 --> 01:30:50,439
due to landing my dream job. I'm a full-time mechanic. That's fucking awesome. Thanks to the

428
01:30:50,439 --> 01:30:54,520
near decade of laughs and many more to come. If you ever play Monster Hunter World with the

429
01:30:54,520 --> 01:31:03,000
Iceborn expansion, that's something I'd love to see. I probably won't. I haven't played any Iceborn.

430
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:11,140
I haven't played any Monster Hunter World for at least seven or eight months. It's a great game.

431
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:15,699
I beat it. I completed it. I went through the next couple little small things after the final

432
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:22,039
and that's not all right. That's what the cat was seeing when it was being shook back and forth.

433
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:30,039
No, thanks for the huge money. Just lots of back-to-back-to-back money right now.

434
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:38,699
I spoiled a bucket. I'm just sorting algorithm awful sound effects.

435
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:56,890
Oh, no. Coconut grabber. Oh, wait. Pizza. Wait. Oh, pizza. Wait. Hold on. I got to feed the cat.

436
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:21,689
Okay. How many? I got ones in chat. If you prefer a plain cheese pizza. Okay. Let's play.

437
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:31,210
At least pepperoni. Yep. Yep. Come here. Okay. How many of you guys

438
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:36,579
um enjoy like for instance like a margarita pizza?

439
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,899
It's the only difference. A margarita pizza really is just like a cheese pizza

440
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:47,659
with a little bit of basil on it. Come here. I like it. I think it's good.

441
01:32:51,779 --> 01:32:59,180
That's tomato. Yeah, so does every pizza has tomato. This is not squished up.

442
01:32:59,819 --> 01:33:08,010
All right. Let's do some scratches.

443
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:15,060
What a lobster pizza.

444
01:33:21,689 --> 01:33:28,090
Not all pizza has tomato sauce as a base. Yeah, but if you order a hundred pizzas,

445
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:33,770
90 of them are going to have red tomato sauce on it. Sometimes, you know, you get a white pizza

446
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:40,729
or pesto sauce or most people put pizza sauce on their pizza. Is this something we actually

447
01:33:40,729 --> 01:33:49,609
have to argue that a majority of pizzas sold on earth have tomato sauce on them? You guys

448
01:33:49,609 --> 01:34:02,390
realize that like most people like order pizza from Domino's more than and I'm on a rant. This

449
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:09,829
is no, there's no rant. It's not like a 30% of people put tomato sauce on their pizza. It's like

450
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:26,500
close to a hundred. Okay. Get it. Yeah. Guys, don't talk about pizza. That means he ends the stream.

451
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:31,300
Oh shit. You're right. Stop doing that. Yeah.

452
01:34:34,250 --> 01:35:01,720
That's got to do it. 21 pounds. All right. Bad mood though. A good massage. And this is all

453
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:17,220
20. I got a 20, 21. All right. Now we're going to feed you the most high quality food.

454
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:44,859
Premium. Only premium for my cat. She's not breathing anymore. Stop stacking them. Why are

455
01:35:44,859 --> 01:36:03,800
you stacking four or five of them? What the fuck are you doing? Anime. Watch the anime. No, Netflix

456
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:09,000
has ruined me. I'm not waiting a week for an episode ever again for any TV show that's ever

457
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,569
been released from here going out. I can't, I'm not doing that anymore. The whole thing's just there.

458
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:25,289
I want to be able to watch an entire series run in three days. I'm not watching one episode

459
01:36:25,289 --> 01:36:32,600
and then waiting like three hours. Oh, we have to go here. This is where the sword upgrades are.

460
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:48,710
Yo, Joe is on Netflix. Yo, I don't want to, I don't want to watch that right now. Oh, it's you.

461
01:36:49,270 --> 01:37:04,260
I'm not finished with that new toy you asked for, but 50,000 for Amelia and a three. Let's go much

462
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:09,350
cuter when you have money. Wait, press two during battle, switch to a different weapon.

463
01:37:11,739 --> 01:37:28,250
All right. Let's see if I can level up. I got new side jobs too.

464
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:50,760
Now let's go to the gym. What about desert pizzas? Um, that's a pie. All right. Stamina again.

465
01:37:50,760 --> 01:38:04,439
Desert feeds. Yeah. I said that weird dessert. I did say that kind of weird

466
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:15,529
desert.

467
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:27,850
Well, it's changing on me. He's changing on me real quick. This makes me really,

468
01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:32,619
really excited for the third game. I hope it's just as weird and interesting.

469
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:51,739
Let's pull things to do. It's the funniest movie of the year. Same. What do you mean same?

470
01:38:57,369 --> 01:39:07,189
Okay. Muscle 4,000. Same. Why I guess it's same. Same. Same. Oh my God. True.

471
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:10,949
All right. Yeah, I guess you're right. Yeah, I guess so.

472
01:39:10,949 --> 01:39:51,529
Oh, those are hard. Ah, did I pass? I didn't pass. I hate that. I hate those. It's hard to

473
01:39:53,289 --> 01:40:07,909
damn it. Damn it. You excited for the next game? Oh, hell yeah. I wonder just how

474
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:13,500
not good, in quotes, the one that came out on PC was.

475
01:40:19,449 --> 01:40:23,609
Wasn't the thing with the one on PC was it was not that great. It was still okay.

476
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:42,090
I fucking blew it again. I can take one hit, right? It's good. There we go. Yeah, you can hit once.

477
01:40:44,779 --> 01:40:55,079
Okay, but it's not the same. TSA is more about the lore. TSA was a vent post by Suda.

478
01:40:57,020 --> 01:41:09,220
Wait, what do you mean? A vent post? It actually was. All right, new side job. Coconut grabber.

479
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:20,300
It was a shit post. In the city have forgotten our rich heritage. They're not collecting coconuts.

480
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:25,100
It's a disaster. Tradition says you're not a real man until you've grabbed your first big fuzzy

481
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:31,180
coconut. You got to be a role model for these kids. They'll do it, right? Kick the coconut

482
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:36,619
trees to make the coconuts fall. Gather as many coconuts as you can. Carry them to the goal

483
01:41:36,619 --> 01:42:01,020
within the time limit. Okay. Coconut grabber. Kick. Move. Dash. Kick. My head. How do I pick

484
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:09,189
them up? Oh, I get it. What the fuck? It was in there. How did you do that to yourself?

485
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:38,949
Fuck. Oh, it's bad. Oh, I got them both. Oh, it's the song. That's gone. I did it.

486
01:42:38,949 --> 01:43:00,039
It's the Mario stuff. Of course it's fucking... I'm just a scarecrow. Can you kick them?

487
01:43:06,149 --> 01:43:39,319
Oh my god. I didn't get one. Shit. You can't kick the scorpion. Hey, watch it. Fuck. I'm not very

488
01:43:39,319 --> 01:44:41,430
good at this one. I have to go like this. Oh, all right. Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.

489
01:44:43,659 --> 01:45:10,819
Oh, bounce. On the bounce. On the bounce. Fuck. It didn't go in. Oh. Okay. I'm good. This is fun.

490
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:52,329
Come on. Shit. Shit. Okay. I'm done. This one's fun. One more.

491
01:45:52,329 --> 01:46:22,739
Mario. What the hell would I do that for? This reminds me of Super Frog. I was going to say

492
01:46:22,739 --> 01:46:32,579
Super Mario. You know what's a bad thing when I hear the word super and I want to say Mario?

493
01:46:32,579 --> 01:46:43,260
I don't think of Mario. I think of Super Frog. Come on. Get it. Why?

494
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:52,489
Oh, oh, oh, oh. No.

495
01:47:08,899 --> 01:47:31,500
Hey, hey. I could have just fucking got it. Wait, wait, wait. Nice. We need a Super Frog emote.

496
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:49,779
There already is one. The BT Better Twitch TV. Cool. Nice work. Oh, Super Frog. Thank you,

497
01:47:49,779 --> 01:48:01,770
Super Bruce for the 530 subs. Super Frog. Is this a cooking one?

498
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:36,060
That's another fun one to do. Break. Change gear. Steer. Break. Change gear.

499
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:56,939
I can do nitro. What do you do? Is this pizzas? All right. High gear. I don't know why I thought

500
01:48:56,939 --> 01:49:01,260
there was a hamburger on the road. Did I pick up? I thought that was a hamburger on the road. It

501
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:12,979
was very small. That's not food or anything. That's a rock, right? Okay. See? I told you.

502
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:22,920
There's stuff on the road. They look friendly and just get real close. God damn it. That's not a

503
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:48,250
car, right? Those are cars. What the fuck? What is this? The Nintendo. Duh. Oh, letter grade.

504
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:58,920
Yeah, of course. They don't give you very much leeway there. I can do better than that.

505
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:10,819
Dude, what was that game? I want to play that game. That Super Nintendo game with,

506
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:17,430
it's like when Montana Max is a Tiny Toons game. We have to spam A and cut down trees and it's

507
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:26,310
like the Olympics. Did I play that on stream? I haven't played that on stream, have I? Oh,

508
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:31,020
this is one of my favorite games. That's my favorite game ever. It's the Tiny Toons Olympic

509
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:37,960
Games game. The Tiny Toons and the games. Somebody will know what I'm talking about.

510
01:50:55,479 --> 01:51:14,539
These oil slicks. Oh, hands on the wheel. Hands on the wheel. Too fast. Too fast. Too fast.

511
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:28,890
50. Thanks Chunky Baloney for the $50. High gear. I'm pretty sure that was me who left the music on,

512
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:34,010
but I was pissed at one of our suitemates, so I did it on purpose. However, I didn't know the CD

513
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:44,520
would skip. It was just supposed to be for like 30 minutes, not four hours. Hey, my bad.

514
01:51:54,359 --> 01:52:08,010
That's so funny. Oh, it's CD guy. That's so fucking funny. The stage just got bigger,

515
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:15,260
but thanks for the $50, dude. You don't have to do that. You guys pay me huge fucking money.

516
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:28,470
You want me to get run over by cars? Go, go, go, go, go. How the fuck did I miss that?

517
01:52:29,029 --> 01:52:42,069
Dude, this stage is going to spin horizontal. It's going to be stage five of Teenage Mutant

518
01:52:42,069 --> 01:53:05,300
Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time. What comes first? Fucking Mack truck. It's hard to determine when

519
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:26,279
the toads evolve into cars in front of screens. Ah, too fast. Why are they all going the same

520
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:32,220
direction? I don't know, but I can't wait to spam. I'm playing that like very soon.

521
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:41,560
Tiny Toons. Outdoor games. That game was hard as shit. It was insanely difficult.

522
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:52,619
Yeah, wacky sports challenge. You got it. That's the one. Cancel the green screen for Tiny Toons.

523
01:53:54,279 --> 01:54:21,930
What do you think I am? The car is going the wrong way.

524
01:54:22,409 --> 01:54:40,840
I just got hit twice. Am I the one going the wrong way? No, I'm not. There's a middle divider.

525
01:54:40,840 --> 01:55:00,039
You're the yellow line. They are going the wrong way. What? That was actually shocking to me.

526
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:16,579
Shocking. I'm trying to rip the fucking wheel, man. I got 30 seconds to get the hell out of here.

527
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:35,020
All right. No more bullshit. Go. No more horse shit. There was no control. I had no control.

528
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:42,819
I'm not going to do it. Wait, is it straight away? Hit it. Get it, please.

529
01:55:47,939 --> 01:55:56,729
No, don't reply. I wanted to get out. I didn't want to reach. It's high.

530
01:55:56,729 --> 01:56:10,869
You have enough driver's license? Yes, I do. All right. Motel. Save game.

531
01:56:11,909 --> 01:56:24,039
Then play Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2003. No, I don't like the cartoon games.

532
01:56:29,699 --> 01:56:36,180
No, I don't like when the game is based on the cartoon. I like for the game to be just the game.

533
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:56,409
Sorry. Tiny toots. No, what I'm saying is the TMNT game, the new ones are tie-ins with Nickelodeon.

534
01:56:57,050 --> 01:57:10,439
It's not like, oh, Konami just made a Ninja Turtles game. How is that wrong? Is that wrong?

535
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:30,149
Are you dumb? No, because that's based on the cartoon. What do you mean so?

536
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:37,670
Okay, I'll give you a hand here. Hulk Ultimate Destruction versus Hulk the Video Game for Wii.

537
01:57:38,979 --> 01:57:42,739
Somebody just made a Hulk game because they wanted to. They didn't base it on a cartoon character.

538
01:57:42,739 --> 01:57:45,779
They didn't base it on a currently running cartoon TV show.

539
01:58:00,579 --> 01:58:06,819
Groupies? What's that supposed to mean? Thanks. If I told you now, I'd ruin the surprise.

540
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:13,300
Go see for yourself. Fine. Whoever they are, I'll make sure they get a nice close-up of my bean katana.

541
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:18,420
All you feel is ecstasy when you kill. New clothes after this. It's like you're getting off.

542
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:24,420
Seriously, you need help. Everybody deals with grief differently, right?

543
01:58:24,979 --> 01:58:28,100
Some people fuck at funerals. I cut off heads.

544
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:36,340
Do what you must, Travis. What the hell?

545
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:51,850
Who does that? All right. So, who do I have? Let's go get some new clothes.

546
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:06,600
You do, psycho screamer. Do you mind something yet? I hope so.

547
01:59:13,239 --> 01:59:16,920
Oh, I don't like this. This is the only one that's different, though.

548
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:32,779
It's $30,000 or whatever. Don't need this. No, I don't like this one.

549
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:37,100
It feels like I'm too fat for this jacket. It feels like the zipper won't go up anymore.

550
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:57,319
Blue shirt? Can I just take the jacket off and be in a graphic tee? Ice cream. Yeah, I want the ice

551
01:59:57,319 --> 02:00:13,939
cream. I'll take it. At least give me new pants. All right. At least there. All right. The screaming

552
02:00:13,939 --> 02:00:33,300
in the background is kind of getting to me here. This is Haunted House CD track 12. Rio-Bate?

553
02:00:33,939 --> 02:00:43,699
15 community subs. Thank you, Rio-Bate. Appreciate it. That's 15 subs. Just dropped right fucking

554
02:00:43,699 --> 02:01:00,819
like. I don't even like this belt. Why did I just get it? I'll take it. I just spent all my money

555
02:01:00,819 --> 02:01:14,520
on stuff that I don't even want. Sing along? Sure. Oh, the Simpsons are riot. Simpsons are riot.

556
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:38,710
Simpsons. Where's the next Simpsons game? Time for a ranking battle. That's it. The Simpsons game

557
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:52,420
sucks. What are you, a dick? I got a new weapon. Oh, hold on. We've got a link. Oh, no, no, no.

558
02:01:52,420 --> 02:02:05,140
Super frog. We got, this guy plays Tiny Toons Adventures. All right. Why do they even need to

559
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:19,319
click on this? I kind of want that shirt now. I kind of want this. All right. I got a new weapon,

560
02:02:19,319 --> 02:02:28,020
right? There it is. Let's see it. Oh, it's like from the last game.

561
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:58,380
Who the fuck is this guy? Wait, this is just like a worker. Who was that? Wait, it's like a

562
02:03:05,399 --> 02:03:11,850
Reborn. Yeah, that guy was making a delivery.

563
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:19,130
That was like a, it was like a pizza delivery. I mean, why would you get out of the car?

564
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:26,619
This looks like a place where I could, here, I'd want to be right now.

565
02:03:33,829 --> 02:03:46,699
Out of limo? I don't know. See, special delivery. Anything else? Could be a secret.

566
02:03:47,829 --> 02:03:53,430
All right. I can do the super slash in a second here. I haven't done enough.

567
02:04:08,659 --> 02:04:18,939
I've been PVPing for fucking decades, kid. Hey, you and your buddy. What, you just new installs?

568
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:33,670
This guy's still talking.

569
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:52,859
Oh, he got me. Jesus. What the fuck? I agree.

570
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:06,979
All right. Take his ass. It doesn't do any damage. Secret.

571
02:05:07,699 --> 02:05:29,260
Oh, not again. You want to roll? Where's the music? Where is the music?

572
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:39,100
It does feel weird without the, yeah, this is weird. Oh, I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow.

573
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:59,640
Hey, came killer collection number 52 and some money. You're the music.

574
02:06:12,010 --> 02:06:24,100
He just smashed his head. This guy can't even do anything.

575
02:06:28,729 --> 02:06:31,689
I queued it up. I was going back and forth about to do it.

576
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:41,369
Another thing I've done like a thousand times. An anonymous gifter has gifted 10

577
02:06:42,649 --> 02:06:48,359
immunity subs. Thanks for the 10 subs, anonymous, whoever you are. Thank you.

578
02:06:49,239 --> 02:06:52,520
I really appreciate it. Shitload of subs.

579
02:06:55,619 --> 02:06:59,029
It's the 10 fucking subs. Cool.

580
02:07:13,529 --> 02:07:21,079
Can't resist.

581
02:07:22,039 --> 02:07:46,760
Oh, sorry. Cool. Chris. Better do it right. Battery juice. Cold cheese. That's fine.

582
02:07:46,760 --> 02:08:00,550
It'll heat up on the burger. He's a celebrity of sorts. Even I caught myself checking him out.

583
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:07,670
Just looking into his eyes. Just fold the piece of cheese up once or twice. Put it in your mouth.

584
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:13,670
Close your mouth. Your body temperature. Your mouth is like a hundred degrees. Heat it up in

585
02:08:13,670 --> 02:08:17,029
there for like 30 seconds at a hundred degrees Fahrenheit in your mouth oven.

586
02:08:17,029 --> 02:08:32,699
And then just like, just lay it on the fucking patty. What the fuck? What?

587
02:08:32,699 --> 02:08:40,810
Oh, my God.

588
02:08:43,289 --> 02:08:56,069
Is that weird? Does that make me weird? You guys think I'm weird? No, I'm not. I am. Yeah,

589
02:08:56,069 --> 02:09:12,840
I'm kind of a weird guy. Yeah. You guys think that? Yeah, I guess so. No, he said normie.

590
02:09:14,119 --> 02:09:18,779
No, no, no. Don't let him have that. He said normie.

591
02:09:18,779 --> 02:09:48,420
Okay. What am I? Am I a reverse Superman? Because is my Clark Kent me pretending to be

592
02:09:48,420 --> 02:10:01,210
normal in front of my parents? You guys get to see Superman? Okay, mother, it's time for me to go.

593
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:08,489
I have some work to do. Oh, work. Yup, that's me. Oh, my little boy's working. Yeah, I gotta go to

594
02:10:08,489 --> 02:10:16,100
work. Oh, can't wait. What do you do for work, honey? Yeah, I'm an accountant. And then skip to

595
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:21,560
me and put it on my fucking twitch shirt. The phone booth or something. I get out and I'm like,

596
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:32,359
look at me. Something like farting and screaming sounds. I can put like, putting cheese in my mouth

597
02:10:32,359 --> 02:10:36,199
and heating it up with my oven in my mouth. I wouldn't tell that to my mother. She'd be like,

598
02:10:36,199 --> 02:10:45,640
what's happening to you? Able to make himself sound like a fucking psycho in a single moment.

599
02:10:46,359 --> 02:11:07,670
It's able to complete John's hope in three settings on stream. It's a chair. It's a statue.

600
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:37,340
No, it's a live streamer. There's another chest in there. McDonald's. Oh, my God. Wait,

601
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:46,489
you're the streamer? Yup, that's me. I'm talking about my secret identity, which is just me with

602
02:11:46,489 --> 02:12:13,850
glasses on. Apparently people are this dumb. Well, they are. Cool, crisp, LT. X cameras.

603
02:12:14,409 --> 02:12:19,289
We just got to see it. You saw it happen. That's why I don't like fixed cameras

604
02:12:20,010 --> 02:12:29,399
in Resident Evil video games. Play ads now. That's not what you've been listening to for the last

605
02:12:29,399 --> 02:12:33,989
two or three straight minutes. The last like 10 minutes has been an ad for McDonald's. What

606
02:12:33,989 --> 02:12:51,140
are you talking about? Oh, don't start fucking counting. The mature filter on. Yeah, just keep

607
02:12:51,140 --> 02:13:26,920
it on with the helmet on. Mr. Touchdown. It's an honor to face you. Man, I love your name.

608
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:32,439
You got to fight me with all your hoes. That's my game. But we need a better arena. Don't you

609
02:13:32,439 --> 02:13:49,899
think? Huh? Let's go, ladies. Santa. God. Ha ha ha dot dot dot. Oh, God.

610
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:11,000
Time to bust out the toy Naomi made. Rocket ship. His long awaited debut.

611
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:23,579
Glass and Barry. Let's pop. I don't remember this at all.

612
02:14:24,380 --> 02:14:44,729
Gotcha Force 2. Yeah, we get to play Gotcha Force. What? A is slash. B is jump. Z is guard.

613
02:14:44,729 --> 02:14:52,149
Press A or B while jumping to jump attack. I see when the X is full and he's just special move.

614
02:14:52,149 --> 02:15:39,899
All right. All right. All right. You can jump over it. No, jump. See, I saw the background.

615
02:15:39,899 --> 02:16:14,119
I thought I had to do a pipe for him again. No, jump over it. No. Why wouldn't you fight

616
02:16:14,119 --> 02:16:29,100
everybody in this suit? That's a good question. Close, right? Wait, he said it twice. You hear

617
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:55,620
that? Oh, fuck. Jump. He's so slow. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. He's dead. He's slow to move.

618
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:14,889
Look at the shrug. Just told his hard enough. He squishes ahead. Explode.

619
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:39,299
A, B, C, Z. I'll hit them all at the same time. That was just like the skip thing. Fucked it all.

620
02:17:39,299 --> 02:17:43,540
That was like when in the middle of an insanely important part of the story, the thing on the

621
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:50,100
bottom right pops up and it's like Peter Griffin and Lois. It's like Family Guy. I'm PM on TBS.

622
02:17:51,299 --> 02:18:07,610
I don't fucking ever want to see that again. I should make some of those.

623
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:15,610
Dirties my style. Just have them pop up randomly. Just made up shows and shit that I do.

624
02:18:27,530 --> 02:18:31,940
Yeah, I'm going to do it. We'll get some made from the green screen incoming.

625
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:48,139
I'll do some like point of the camera. Walk into frame. Look around. Look at the bottom.

626
02:18:48,139 --> 02:18:52,860
Point at the title of the fucking game or something. And like, yeah, look at that. Thumbs up.

627
02:18:53,579 --> 02:18:54,620
Then like walk back off.

628
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:27,819
Charlie McDonald? Travis Touchdown. How do you pick your nose with gloves on?

629
02:19:32,569 --> 02:19:37,510
That's kind of disgusting. Well, you take your glove off, you pick your nose,

630
02:19:37,510 --> 02:20:01,180
and then you put your glove back on. Fingerless gloves. Skippable optional boss coming. Do it.

631
02:20:02,139 --> 02:20:13,420
Okay. Ice Queen? What's with the harsh treatment?

632
02:20:14,299 --> 02:20:28,979
Anime time. We will. I like her better when she's horny.

633
02:20:34,389 --> 02:21:02,219
ES2 feet. You guys are fucking crazy. Hands and feet in all old games were just like Lego blocks.

634
02:21:02,219 --> 02:21:10,600
That's all they were. Like all feet in all games before like, like 2007.

635
02:21:11,399 --> 02:21:33,049
It was all like dinosaur feet. And then like mittens for hands. No, I want new. I want to

636
02:21:33,049 --> 02:21:43,979
jacket. Watch the anime. I'm not watching anime. No, no, no. This thing would be fun to have in

637
02:21:43,979 --> 02:21:47,500
your bedroom. Just get up in the morning and fucking roundhouse kick this thing as hard as

638
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:50,540
you can. And then that's how you start your day. I would start every day like that.

639
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:56,569
I would get up in the morning and like kind of get in the shower, comb my hair, and then just

640
02:21:56,569 --> 02:22:02,250
do the hardest spinning roundhouse kick I could and fucking destroy this thing. And then I'm ready

641
02:22:02,250 --> 02:22:24,389
for the day. Let's go. Jump. You can do it. You can do it. You can pull your hernia every morning.

642
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:40,329
I already have a hernia, man. I'm fucking falling apart. All right, let go. Let go.

643
02:22:45,829 --> 02:23:05,190
Lost 0.3 pounds. Okay. Time for some stretches. Stop punching the cat. I'm not punching.

644
02:23:06,149 --> 02:23:26,010
That's how hard I'm pressing A. Which way? 19. Oh, 0.6 pounds.

645
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:39,379
Lost a full pound. All right, play. That was close. What the fuck is this? This is No More

646
02:23:39,379 --> 02:23:48,979
Heroes 2. No More Heroes 3 is releasing in 2020. We're all really excited about it.

647
02:23:49,780 --> 02:24:06,760
One more. One more. Yeah. When will we get No More Streamer? I don't know.

648
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:15,420
I feel like I'm gonna break my nunchuck if I keep doing this.

649
02:24:20,149 --> 02:24:44,500
Go, go, go, go, go. That was pretty good. Lined up like that. Beat my record. 23. Oh, God. Okay.

650
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:51,450
Speed. One of the finest fucking quality food. 18.4 pounds. That's good.

651
02:24:52,329 --> 02:25:23,590
Oh, she's 25 when I started. All right. Take a quick dump. Save more. Watch the anime. Watch

652
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:31,690
the secret anime. All right. Where's the secret boss? Is the secret boss somewhere here?

653
02:25:32,329 --> 02:25:41,000
Do it. What do you mean do it? Do I have to wait out? It's in the lore. What? I have to watch

654
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:54,069
the anime. The anime is the secret boss. Get this.

655
02:25:59,350 --> 02:26:14,569
Is this a TV? Is this a show? Why is it like a TV? Like, what is this? Where's the secret boss?

656
02:26:15,290 --> 02:26:58,979
Okay, I was watching that. That's too fucking bad. You missed the boss. You're lying to me. There's

657
02:26:58,979 --> 02:27:19,110
no boss at the end of a tape. There is. Hold on. There is? Unironically not lying?

658
02:27:21,579 --> 02:27:32,040
What do you mean? It's at the end of a tape? Yup. What do you mean yup? Go back to the motel.

659
02:27:38,379 --> 02:27:53,700
We're telling the truth. You're being manipulated. Put up another video over the cringe.

660
02:27:54,579 --> 02:28:54,790
Okay. Hang tight for a sec. Sit right here for a minute. I'm going to turn it on in just a moment.

661
02:28:57,750 --> 02:29:12,280
Hey. I didn't want you to see it yet. What is this? Travis, there's a new challenger coming after

662
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:23,459
you. Stop. Stop. There's a new challenger coming after your ranking. Her name is Kimi Hoel.

663
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:43,350
Is this the secret boss? I mean, do you guys really give a shit if it's stretched?

664
02:29:44,549 --> 02:29:55,239
I don't. Okay. She's an all-American beam katana champion. Head over to the university

665
02:29:55,239 --> 02:29:58,760
again to see for yourself. I've got some other info for you too. The guys who killed your friend

666
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:03,989
Bishop. I've dredged up some details on them. This one's on the house. Looks like they were

667
02:30:03,989 --> 02:30:08,389
henchmen from the pizza bat group. That means they are hiding somewhere in town. The rest is up to

668
02:30:08,389 --> 02:31:26,120
you. Okay, let's put it on. Is there actually a boss fight here? Where's the boss? There's nothing

669
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:42,809
here. You were wrong. Thanks for the lie, liars. Where the hell is it? Being lied to. There's no

670
02:31:42,809 --> 02:31:57,540
secret boss. It's a lie. It's a lie. Revenge mission now available. It's death time. Okay,

671
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:02,180
so ranking challenge or revenge mission one. Is this what you were talking about?

672
02:32:03,819 --> 02:32:10,569
I want to do these other things. There's so much stuff to do. Kimi is the secret boss. Do it now.

673
02:32:12,250 --> 02:32:21,000
No, no, no, no, no, no. Do I have to do this revenge mission right now? What are you guys talking

674
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:28,620
about? Is it time sensitive? I don't believe a single word you're saying. You can do it later.

675
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:42,979
Yeah, there's a time sensitive. Get out of here. Santa destroys being monopolized. Everywhere you

676
02:32:42,979 --> 02:32:47,459
look it's pizza bat, pizza bat, pizza bat. Soon there'll be nowhere to get a juicy t-bone.

677
02:32:48,659 --> 02:32:53,860
And my lead cook got mad cow disease and butchered my entire kitchen staff. Can you help me?

678
02:32:54,819 --> 02:33:02,149
Uh, wow. Continue holding the button to cook the steak. Cook the steaks the way the customers

679
02:33:02,149 --> 02:33:15,110
want them. And the meat. Ah, this is gonna be awesome. Rare, medium, well done.

680
02:33:24,260 --> 02:33:36,139
Oops, that was right out of the back. Rare. There we go.

681
02:33:52,500 --> 02:34:09,979
That's too done. Perfect. This is making me hungry.

682
02:34:23,770 --> 02:34:27,209
All right. Help me out here. When you go to a restaurant

683
02:34:29,129 --> 02:34:34,649
and this steak on the menu, is it rude to order a steak well done at a restaurant? Are you saying

684
02:34:34,649 --> 02:34:40,299
that, Hey, I always thought that was like, Oh, the chef's an asshole or something, right? Like,

685
02:34:40,299 --> 02:34:45,299
Hey, I'm ordering a steak well done at your restaurant. I think you're an asshole, right?

686
02:34:45,860 --> 02:34:55,610
That's kind of how it's seen. If I'm, that's the etiquette. That's a fuck you.

687
02:35:02,549 --> 02:35:09,479
They hate it. Why do I always have this image of some chef, some waiter coming over the ticket

688
02:35:09,479 --> 02:35:13,799
being like, Hey, the guy at table seven wants a well done steak, steak well done. And they just

689
02:35:13,799 --> 02:35:21,159
start crashing the place. Fucking steak well done. Pots all over the place. Is that like what

690
02:35:21,159 --> 02:35:28,299
happened? Do I watch too much fucking cooking American TV where everything is a constant

691
02:35:28,299 --> 02:35:33,100
problem in the kitchen? See as somebody that watches American TV based on cooking shows,

692
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:39,100
it's fucking mayhem back there every second of every hour. Is that true?

693
02:35:40,459 --> 02:35:49,110
It's just constant conflict. What was wrong with that?

694
02:35:49,110 --> 02:36:05,739
Like is there always, is this just drama? Like do the chefs all hate each other?

695
02:36:06,379 --> 02:36:30,219
That guy wanted medium? What? It's the quick little seer. Disgusting. Absolutely revolting,

696
02:36:30,219 --> 02:36:37,700
if I'm honest with you. Taking out of the package, putting it on one side for five seconds on the

697
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:48,250
other side for five seconds. No, that's not for me. Blue. Oh, it's cooking faster.

698
02:36:53,639 --> 02:36:57,319
What do you mean tastes like shit? That was well done. What was wrong with that?

699
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:14,170
That's fucking well done. It's green mate. I cooked it till it was green. That's well done.

700
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:38,469
Well done. Perfect. Why does everybody want well done steak here?

701
02:37:47,399 --> 02:38:01,110
There we go. An actual human medium. Give it to me raw. Whoa. Give it to me burnt. What the fuck?

702
02:38:01,909 --> 02:38:18,219
We're all insulting you. Well done. I don't even fucking like steak. Steak sucks. Like I don't

703
02:38:18,219 --> 02:38:23,739
even eat it. Why am I pretending like I'm some kind of, you know, did you say you got an order

704
02:38:23,739 --> 02:38:30,139
from a chef? Does the chef like you? I don't know. What the fuck? What do I care? I don't even like

705
02:38:30,139 --> 02:38:50,920
steak. I like some steak. Some of it. I mean, I like steak and cheese subs, but that's just like

706
02:38:50,920 --> 02:39:06,739
a carved up fucking hamburger. Steakums. Yeah. And I would like someone to come to tell me the

707
02:39:06,739 --> 02:39:11,500
problem with it with a steak. I'd love to know what it is. Take a look at the back of the box

708
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:15,260
on a steak. Oh, steak comes on the free. Look at the back of that box. You want to know what's in

709
02:39:15,260 --> 02:39:23,909
it. You want to know what's in steak? 100% just beef. There's nothing else in it. There's literally

710
02:39:23,909 --> 02:39:29,909
nothing else in it. It's just meat is no fucking like fillers and emulsifiers and oils. No, it's

711
02:39:30,389 --> 02:39:35,639
frozen meat. That's all it is. This is not a joke. This is me telling you real life.

712
02:39:36,709 --> 02:39:40,950
This is not a comedy routine. This is me telling you, look at the back of the box. Next time you

713
02:39:40,950 --> 02:39:45,590
go to the grocery store and you get steak, it's just 100% beef. It just is. I don't know. But

714
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:50,700
does that mean it's like eyeballs? I don't know. I have no idea, but it's real. There's nothing

715
02:39:50,700 --> 02:40:13,299
else in it. Look it up. Look this up. What is really in steak? New lawsuit reveals the world's

716
02:40:13,299 --> 02:40:19,340
grossest meat products, probably Steak'ems. We thought pink slime was bad. Turns out the stuff

717
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:23,340
hails in comparison to Steak'ems, which the name alone should tell you is bad news.

718
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:27,340
But the uninitiated Steak'ems are not dog food, but are instead kind of like frozen DIY Philly

719
02:40:27,340 --> 02:40:31,100
cheesesteak. But in a trademark infringement suit this week that pitted Steak'ems owners

720
02:40:31,100 --> 02:40:34,860
against the self-philly cheesesteak and pizza shop named Steak'em Up, the ugly truth of the

721
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:39,819
mass-produced sandwich steak was revealed and the details are pretty bleak. This is 2012, by the way.

722
02:40:40,780 --> 02:40:50,260
Okay. In courtroom proceedings, the composition of the meat came to light. The Daily News reports

723
02:40:50,819 --> 02:40:54,899
that it's chopped, formed, and emulsified meat product that is comprised of beef trimmings

724
02:40:54,899 --> 02:40:59,620
left over after an animal is slaughtered and all the primary cuts, such as tenderloin, fillet,

725
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:04,340
and ribeye are removed. The emulsified meat is pressed into a loaf and sliced and frozen.

726
02:41:05,139 --> 02:41:28,489
Okay. Steak'ems are not ribeye steak. Who cares? Yeah. Fine. Not emulsified.

727
02:41:30,219 --> 02:41:36,700
Did I say that? Well, no. What did I say? I said there were no emulsifiers in it.

728
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:41,100
I said no emulsifiers. That doesn't mean it was not emulsified previously,

729
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:49,829
but not in the package. There's no emulsifiers. There are no, like for instance, there's no like

730
02:41:49,829 --> 02:41:57,350
egg yolk or there's no like oil. Could they have crushed it up and emulsified it in a big machine?

731
02:41:57,350 --> 02:42:02,280
Yeah. But not here. Not when it's in the package. Why am I defending it? I don't know. I like them.

732
02:42:03,079 --> 02:42:12,149
Is something wrong with me liking steak'ems? Yeah. It's like fucking, it's like trimmings.

733
02:42:12,870 --> 02:42:21,530
Guess what's in a McDonald's hamburger? Not filet mignon. You know what's in a Wendy's hamburger?

734
02:42:22,409 --> 02:42:37,559
Yeah. All pure like filet mignon meat. I got some money for that though. What am I talking about?

735
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:41,879
You eat McDonald's and you eat Wendy's and you're telling me that I'm crazy for eating steak'ems?

736
02:42:41,879 --> 02:42:56,700
It's the same shit. Just one's different. One's like shaved and put in a different box. My best

737
02:42:56,700 --> 02:43:12,620
tile layer actually fell. You're eating dog food. Please. Shaved. They make the patties thicker and

738
02:43:12,620 --> 02:43:19,860
they send the fucking rest of McDonald's or wherever they go. Oh, this is just Tetris.

739
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:33,110
Okay. Rotate. Oh boy. Wait. Wait, what do I have to fill this whole thing in?

740
02:43:33,110 --> 02:43:40,120
Oh, this ain't, this is never going to happen.

741
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:58,579
They can get it all up. All right. I got worked up because people were fucking flaming steak'ems.

742
02:43:58,579 --> 02:44:31,159
That sounds pretty good actually. Oh man. Just pick it all up. Look at this again. Okay. Now. Dog food

743
02:44:31,159 --> 02:45:02,469
brain. No, I'm not another dog food brain. This dude sucks. Well, whatever. I don't have trouble

744
02:45:02,469 --> 02:45:08,299
with this shit. I'm not allowed to have a little bit of trouble with some shit.

745
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:27,719
Of course I can. I can have trouble with whatever I want. I don't know, just a square? You have to

746
02:45:27,719 --> 02:45:36,389
be perfect. I know. And I don't know. I have no, I don't know. I'll get it eventually when I get,

747
02:45:36,389 --> 02:45:40,709
I'm not doing level three. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't even pay attention to this right

748
02:45:40,709 --> 02:45:48,790
now. It's like too much for me right now. Maybe like this. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

749
02:45:48,790 --> 02:46:30,469
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Got it. I don't know. I don't know. It's got to be like

750
02:46:31,850 --> 02:46:47,610
here. I mean that where else he's got worms in his brain.

751
02:46:52,790 --> 02:47:00,659
Steak'ems brain. No, we're not going to slander any companies. No, no, no company slandering.

752
02:47:00,659 --> 02:47:11,620
Okay. I can't do it. I can't. This is not right. This is wrong.

753
02:47:14,739 --> 02:47:35,079
This is wrong. It's wrong. No, no. I'm going to run out of time. No, don't I level one? I can't.

754
02:47:35,079 --> 02:47:45,719
You can't do this to me. No, you can't do this to me. Wait and then I got it.

755
02:47:45,719 --> 02:48:11,239
Oh, I don't. Fuck. Oh, fuck you. God damn it. Did it? No, it what? Oh, I didn't.

756
02:48:11,239 --> 02:49:19,579
I hate this piece. I can't. It's a stupid Z. Z's fucking me up bad. Wait, hold on. You piece of

757
02:49:19,659 --> 02:50:11,829
shit. You piece of shit. No.

758
02:50:12,389 --> 02:50:15,909
Fuck.

759
02:50:39,739 --> 02:50:53,959
A termite could do this. No, you don't understand. You don't understand. No, you don't understand.

760
02:50:57,590 --> 02:51:23,129
Which one is it? It's so close. I had it. Oh, don't have it. What do you mean? Yellow, yellow,

761
02:51:23,129 --> 02:51:27,770
yellow. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Yellow? What do I put yellow over here?

762
02:51:37,739 --> 02:51:43,590
Done. What? What are you talking about? How do you mean done? I had it. What are you talking about?

763
02:51:43,590 --> 02:51:53,559
What are you saying? I'm second guessing. Second guessing me. What? Oh my God. What? Turn off the

764
02:51:53,559 --> 02:52:13,020
console. No. It's too big. Keep the yellow there. What am I supposed to do with this guy?

765
02:52:13,979 --> 02:52:23,750
Put the red in the bottom left. What? Move the yellow.

766
02:52:28,379 --> 02:52:33,899
I physically cannot do these puzzles. I can't do them. I can't do them. I can't even see them

767
02:52:33,899 --> 02:52:58,620
right. You fucked it up twice. Wait, I got it. Just do this. Where is it? Over here? I have it.

768
02:52:58,620 --> 02:53:03,479
It's done, but it's not done. I can't do it. I can't do it. No. You don't understand. I can't

769
02:53:03,479 --> 02:53:14,709
do it. Did you see that? Where did it go? Why? What happened? I can't flip it. I don't know.

770
02:53:15,909 --> 02:53:49,049
How do I get it to be over there? I picked a great day to start doing CBD oil, by the way.

771
02:53:49,049 --> 02:53:54,940
What a great day to start it during this.

772
02:53:54,940 --> 02:54:25,979
Okay. I need to focus on this. This is important. This is very important.

773
02:54:28,379 --> 02:54:34,620
I was like, there's no way a noble hero is going to have anything that could fuck me up right now.

774
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:49,879
No way. I was wrong. All right. I'm looking at a fucking guide. I don't even care.

775
02:54:52,680 --> 02:55:02,489
Just give me the thing. Okay. Good. Yeah. For those of you that don't know,

776
02:55:05,290 --> 02:55:13,190
I have bone problems. One of those bone problems, trying it out. I just started it,

777
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:18,889
actually literally yesterday. I'm trying to see if CBD helps with the pain.

778
02:55:20,729 --> 02:55:24,649
We're testing it out. Welcome to the test. Okay. Let's finish this.

779
02:55:27,770 --> 02:55:32,889
Works pretty good for pain. Not so good on trying to understand where pieces of a thing go on screen.

780
02:55:33,850 --> 02:55:48,069
Wait. This is not even accurate. You gave me the wrong... This is wrong. This shit's wrong, man.

781
02:55:48,950 --> 02:56:01,370
Shit's wrong. You got it wrong. You got it wrong. It don't even fit there. Look at the guide.

782
02:56:02,010 --> 02:56:10,629
I can't flip it. There is no flipping. I can't flip the piece. It only does this or this.

783
02:56:13,639 --> 02:56:29,899
You gave me the wrong guide, and I'm the dumb one. What are you going to say about that?

784
02:56:29,899 --> 02:56:47,030
This is the same thing I had last time. Fuck. Somebody give me a different guide. I can't. It

785
02:56:47,030 --> 02:56:54,379
won't fit. Right in the bottom left. Well, give me a different guide. What are you guys... You guys

786
02:56:54,379 --> 02:57:00,299
were spamming me with the incorrect guide. You gave me the wrong guide. Somebody was just fucking

787
02:57:00,299 --> 02:57:06,780
with me. This is completely different than that one. This is 1000% different. This is not even

788
02:57:06,780 --> 02:57:10,620
remotely similar to the guide that you were linking. We have the last of 30 straight hours.

789
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:21,659
Okay. This piece don't even fit here, man. This doesn't fit here. This is wrong too.

790
02:57:23,780 --> 02:57:33,719
What are you doing to me? Yellow in the bottom right, and then this shit don't even fit.

791
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:45,340
What the fuck? No. You can't. Swap the red and the purple. Why do you give me these?

792
02:57:50,229 --> 02:57:56,389
God, this is fucking ridiculous. What do you mean swap the red and the purple? That doesn't do

793
02:57:56,389 --> 02:58:16,139
anything. You guys gave me two wrong things. Use this guy. Swap green and blue. I gotta do it again.

794
02:58:17,100 --> 02:58:26,020
This is fucking hilarious. Holy shit. Do I have it? Wait. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

795
02:58:26,020 --> 02:58:47,559
wait, wait, wait. Is that right? Perfect. Perfect. No, you linked me this before and it's wrong.

796
02:58:47,559 --> 02:58:53,020
It's not even accurate. Just play the meat game. No, I have to beat this.

797
02:58:58,739 --> 02:59:04,200
That image is wrong. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. It's not even right.

798
02:59:16,979 --> 02:59:32,969
So what was wrong with this one? Somebody gave me a fake one. You guys are giving me fake ones.

799
02:59:32,969 --> 03:00:03,350
This dude is so disappointed in you. He's too high. No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm taking a small dose

800
03:00:04,149 --> 03:00:08,469
to see how it works for pain relief and it actually works pretty very, very good so far.

801
03:00:09,030 --> 03:01:35,879
I'm gonna give it a week. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. Wait. Hey, look at me. That was, I can't

802
03:01:35,879 --> 03:01:44,260
fucking believe it took that long. All right. I just had to prove that I wasn't like the dumbest

803
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:48,100
person you've ever watched on live stream. I just needed to make sure I wanted, let's do the

804
03:01:48,100 --> 03:02:13,129
hamburger one. You still are. Ban that person. How dare you say that to me? Idiot, idiot, idiot,

805
03:02:13,129 --> 03:02:31,030
idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot. There you go. There's your, this is your brain on drugs. No,

806
03:02:31,590 --> 03:02:40,309
I'm on a very small dose. Okay. I'm on like three grams of CBD. Okay. It's like,

807
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:51,739
it's not even like a quarter of a regular one. That's a shit load. What?

808
03:02:54,920 --> 03:03:17,500
No, three milligrams. No, not three. I just rammed with that. CBD doesn't make you high. There's THC

809
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:34,469
in this thing that I have. It's 3.3 milligrams of THC, which is not a whole lot, but I don't want a

810
03:03:34,469 --> 03:03:53,239
whole lot. I just want to just try to do a little trial for pain relief. Yeah. The goal is for me

811
03:03:53,239 --> 03:04:05,979
to not to get, I'm not trying to get fucked up. Who really wants us to believe him? Share your weed

812
03:04:05,979 --> 03:04:28,059
brownie recipe. I don't have one. Jeremy, you're doing fine. Hey, thanks. I can't play Jump King

813
03:04:28,059 --> 03:04:35,340
ever again. I deleted my, I'm not starting at zero. Heard nothing but good things about

814
03:04:35,340 --> 03:04:46,860
CBD and inflammation. Yes. Especially the idea is if I have neuralgia, if I have nerve pain,

815
03:04:46,860 --> 03:04:52,860
just nerve damage somehow, and there's only a few things I can really do to try to counteract it.

816
03:04:53,979 --> 03:05:01,799
So there, it's, you know, it's out there that for potentially nerve pain,

817
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:19,239
THC and CBD can maybe help. So I'm trying. I wasn't going to talk about it, but why would I care to

818
03:05:19,239 --> 03:05:24,840
even bring it up if I'm doing like a small dose of CBD and THC? Like, well, I don't care. But like,

819
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:28,360
if you can't do a children's puzzle in like 30 minutes, then like it's, I probably should,

820
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:42,600
I should probably tell you. Started a week ago. Yeah. I'm going to give it like two weeks.

821
03:05:43,319 --> 03:05:50,540
Just doing like a very small dose. And I don't know. I'm not going to tell you that it's,

822
03:05:50,540 --> 03:05:58,659
I don't want a placebo effect to happen here, but we'll see in a week. How do I feel? I feel

823
03:05:58,659 --> 03:06:06,899
pretty good. I feel good. And I guess thankfully that was, whoa, that was fine. The really good

824
03:06:06,899 --> 03:06:19,909
part is it's medium. That's, that's a medium steak. It's legal in Las Vegas, though.

825
03:06:22,309 --> 03:06:32,870
How is that not well done? You want it more than that? Like that? You don't want to eat that,

826
03:06:32,870 --> 03:06:45,530
right? That's why he moved there. It was becoming legal in Massachusetts too,

827
03:06:45,530 --> 03:07:08,459
before I left. So that's not why that was well done. He just couldn't wait. I feel like I'm

828
03:07:08,459 --> 03:07:27,590
playing somebody's a monster hunter. I feel like I'm playing monster hunter. Play the actual game.

829
03:07:28,950 --> 03:07:48,629
Yeah, I will eventually click link now, click link now, click link. Stakeham emerges as unlikely

830
03:07:48,629 --> 03:08:10,780
coronavirus and misinformation watchdog. What? Wait, during a crisis, people turned to many

831
03:08:10,780 --> 03:08:14,620
different places for advice, wisdom, and comfort during the global coronavirus pandemic. Many

832
03:08:14,620 --> 03:08:20,940
are tapping an unlikely source, a processed meat brand. Stakehams, the decades-old maker of thin

833
03:08:20,940 --> 03:08:26,059
sliced frozen beef used in cheese steak sandwiches, has garnered considerable attention on social

834
03:08:26,059 --> 03:08:30,219
media during the coronavirus crisis with a Twitter thread warning people to question their news

835
03:08:30,219 --> 03:08:42,299
sources amid a torrent of misinformation about the virus. Did I just eat the onion? Is this real?

836
03:08:42,299 --> 03:09:01,420
This is real, right? Okay, no, it's real. Oh, Stakehams. Yeah, Stakehams. All right, now

837
03:09:01,420 --> 03:09:13,620
let's do the actual mission. People who uses a craft Facebook, who uses like Stakehams Facebook

838
03:09:13,620 --> 03:09:27,940
as their news source. That is a little, that's a little odd. Go to the university. I'm gonna,

839
03:09:27,940 --> 03:09:36,600
I need to save the game. Secret boss, you can miss it. Go to the university. I'm going.

840
03:09:40,809 --> 03:10:10,500
Oh, Stakehams. Oh, whatever. All right, university. To the university. Is this the university?

841
03:10:10,500 --> 03:10:23,159
Where's the university? At the university? Wait, that's the university. It's right here.

842
03:10:24,200 --> 03:10:29,819
Wait, what are you talking about? It's just the next mission. How is this a secret?

843
03:10:30,459 --> 03:11:00,020
I had to unlock. Are you prepared? Oh, you found the hidden boss? You fucking kidding me?

844
03:11:00,659 --> 03:11:05,459
You think I should try to swear less? Like really? Would I be active about it? Should I just think

845
03:11:05,459 --> 03:11:14,629
about, you know, what am I saying here? Should I, should I stop swearing? Place words. Should I

846
03:11:14,629 --> 03:11:24,090
start saying like fuck? Should I say like look out or shit? Shit's fine. My mother told me she

847
03:11:24,090 --> 03:11:40,649
wants me to stop saying the F word. Gotcha. By the way, big fan. Look at you. Gotcha. Swearing is for

848
03:11:40,649 --> 03:11:58,700
CBD users. What was that? Oh, it must have been the secret boss. What the fuck?

849
03:11:59,180 --> 03:12:01,739
What the fuck!

850
03:12:03,979 --> 03:12:05,979
Sorry mom we both did it.

851
03:12:06,559 --> 03:12:13,709

God was a pain in the ass

857
03:13:20,340 --> 03:13:22,340
Oh

Extra cranked when they're a movie with Jason Statham where if he's if his blood pressure dropped

860
03:14:21,459 --> 03:14:30,069
Was heart rate dropped by certain percent by a certain amount. He was his heart exploded that movie must have been crazy

861
03:14:30,069 --> 03:14:33,229
I wish it was public domain. I would love to watch it

862
03:14:35,270 --> 03:14:38,190
Can I can I do that on Amazon the Amazon twitch watch party thing?

863
03:14:38,829 --> 03:14:41,780

03:14:58,829 --> 03:15:04,379
Frank was made public domain by Donald Trump

867
03:15:05,799 --> 03:15:07,799

Take it take it or I'll totally die

879
03:16:07,690 --> 03:16:14,090
Okay, thanks. I could use a dose of innocence that last fight got a little sick even for me

880
03:16:18,049 --> 03:16:23,690
But you don't read it huh read it read it in front of you now here

881
03:16:24,129 --> 03:16:26,610
Yes, you have to read it out loud

No, I wasn't even gonna open it and I was gonna shred it to Travis the great. So you read and I'll play it on my flu

883
03:16:32,489 --> 03:16:33,489
Okay

03:16:33,489 --> 03:16:37,489
You're you're joking right read this here

885
03:16:38,010 --> 03:16:48,889
Here we go. Get into it to my dearest Travis the great. Hi there, Travis the great

886
03:16:48,889 --> 03:16:52,370
I am the girl who loves you the most in the entire world

887
03:16:52,530 --> 03:16:55,209
The hell is going on that I'm your number one fan

888
03:16:55,209 --> 03:17:00,170
I need some kind of evidence because no matter how much I insist that I'm your number one

889
03:17:00,250 --> 03:17:04,010
Any other chick or bitch can approach you and say the exact same thing

890
03:17:04,409 --> 03:17:12,450
That is why I've decided that I should become strong by doing so I knew that someday I'd be able to get closer to you

891
03:17:13,090 --> 03:17:16,489
Putting my title as Travis the great's number one fan on the line

892
03:17:16,489 --> 03:17:22,129
I embarked on this path and ended up winning the national student assassin championship

893
03:17:22,129 --> 03:17:26,969
I really did my best, but you know in hindsight, it was a cinch

894
03:17:26,969 --> 03:17:33,170
I guess I'm just blessed. I can master in one day techniques that would take others years to do

895
03:17:33,530 --> 03:17:42,409
Pretty awesome, right and then I got greedy a new urge a vision that just maybe I could win a fight against Travis the great

896
03:17:42,930 --> 03:17:47,489
Now my goal is to be had Travis the great therefore surpassing my hero

897
03:17:48,129 --> 03:17:54,809
Oops, and I actually write that it's kind of embarrassing, you know. Well, anyways, I've made up my mind

898
03:17:54,809 --> 03:17:58,170
I made an oath. I won't be killed by anyone

899
03:17:58,290 --> 03:18:04,209
I shall defeat Travis the great in battle only then will Travis the great become mine and mine only

900
03:18:05,690 --> 03:18:09,209
Travis the great's number one fan Kimmy Howell

901
03:18:14,180 --> 03:18:21,180
Okay, so much for the dose of innocence, but you've got the bloodlust I'm sure about that the flute

919
03:21:42,409 --> 03:21:47,319
There's another spammable saying I missed those Cheshire trust. Oh

Oh man, that's so

1019
03:39:32,299 --> 03:39:34,059
Sad that I did that

1020
03:39:34,059 --> 03:39:39,149
I was trying to skip it because I wanted to go down look up and grab because I was just trying to save time because I was

03:39:55,760 --> 03:39:59,200
One time I had a sleeve of oreos and I threw up my mother's bed afterwards because I wasn't feeling well

1026
03:39:59,520 --> 03:40:04,719
One time I ate a steak that I may have been uh, too undercooked me and I shit my pants and threw up my mother's bedroom

In the toilet and puked in my mother's bedroom

For the humidifier story, oh one time I I thought that I could put essential oils in the humidifier

1041
03:42:41,979 --> 03:42:44,540
And overnight it got like really really really heavy in the roof

1042
03:42:45,340 --> 03:42:48,700
And I woke up and I was like, holy shit. This is so

1043
03:42:49,260 --> 03:42:51,420
It smells like a eucalyptus tree in here

1044
03:42:51,979 --> 03:42:55,659

03:43:48,340 --> 03:43:51,170

Wouldn't stop pissing out heat no matter what

1058

Or the heater was broken and it was in the middle of like july something like that

1059
03:44:42,290 --> 03:44:50,559
It was one of those scenarios where you do like the air in the room is going into your mouth

1060
03:44:51,280 --> 03:44:53,600
That's how you can tell when it's a little too hot and humid somewhere

03:53:49,709 --> 03:53:50,989
2

1135
03:53:50,989 --> 03:53:52,590
Oh here it comes

1136
03:53:52,590 --> 03:54:20,989
Let's hear it. What is it? Say it. I said it's tf2

1137
03:54:21,629 --> 03:54:24,750
What is it?

1138
03:54:24,829 --> 03:54:26,829
Um, but I i'm hold on

1139
03:54:27,709 --> 03:54:29,709
I didn't say I was gonna play this

1140
03:54:30,989 --> 03:54:32,959
on tuesday

1141
03:54:32,959 --> 03:54:36,959
I drunkenly said say any game and then people wrote tf2 and I said no

1142
03:54:38,620 --> 03:54:41,579
So what are you talking about? That was like a week ago

1143
03:54:45,139 --> 03:54:50,059
Oh shit, i'm gonna die

1144
03:54:50,059 --> 03:54:51,260
Get up

1145
03:54:51,260 --> 03:55:02,319
Gonna knock me back to normal

1146
03:55:06,799 --> 03:55:07,920
No

1147
03:55:07,920 --> 03:55:10,350
You said do you play any game?

1148
03:55:10,350 --> 03:55:13,309
I said, yeah that night and then I said I don't want to play tf2 and I was like

1149
03:55:13,709 --> 03:55:16,350
And jump king was the one I played and I deleted my save file

1150
03:55:16,989 --> 03:55:31,260
I'm not playing tf2

1151
03:55:33,520 --> 03:55:38,000
That it was because of the download time

1152
03:55:39,899 --> 03:55:41,969
Yeah, it is

1153
03:55:41,969 --> 03:55:43,170
big

1154
03:55:43,170 --> 03:55:49,440
Big excuse

1155
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:51,180
Get them all

1156
03:55:51,180 --> 03:56:01,739
Yes, it's a bad excuse

1157
03:56:01,979 --> 03:56:05,180
Oh here here. I've got a i've got a really good excuse for you

1158
03:56:06,299 --> 03:56:08,299
I don't want to play it

1159
03:56:09,280 --> 03:56:11,280
Okay, that's good. All right. I'm

1160
03:56:12,399 --> 03:56:14,399
We've got it. All right

1161
03:56:15,200 --> 03:56:17,920
But is this like a fucking homework assignment that I didn't turn in

1162
03:56:33,739 --> 03:56:39,340
It takes one hour and 30 minutes to download no, I can probably get it in like no, all right

1163
03:56:41,079 --> 03:56:43,079
Silence silence

1164
03:56:44,319 --> 03:56:47,219
Silence

1165
03:56:47,219 --> 03:56:50,500
I don't want to play fucking tf2. I have no

1166
03:56:51,540 --> 03:56:56,020
Bone in my whole body right now wants to download and install and play tf2

1167
03:56:56,500 --> 03:57:01,860
I don't have a bone in my body right now. That's like that's do that. No, that's not gonna happen

1168
03:57:02,579 --> 03:57:04,579
I have to be honest and real with you

1169
03:57:05,680 --> 03:57:09,840
No, and no amount of dot dot dot dot. Maybe he'll turn his face game on and poop on us

1170
03:57:09,840 --> 03:57:11,840
So whatever we're gonna we want him to do

1171
03:57:12,000 --> 03:57:15,520
Maybe we'll turn he'll turn face game on if we go dot dot dot

1172
03:57:20,610 --> 03:57:22,610
Nope, that's not gonna happen

1173
03:57:28,209 --> 03:57:31,329
Oh, you said silence it well, yes stay that way

1174
03:57:34,610 --> 03:57:39,889
I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it. No, I like talk to me

1175
03:57:42,530 --> 03:57:51,309
Okay, you shouldn't be doing thc

1176
03:57:52,030 --> 03:57:57,469
That's a that's a dose. It's a fucking like quarter dose. I did like six hours ago

1177
03:57:57,790 --> 03:58:17,940
It was an excuse as to why I couldn't do a four-year-old's puzzle quarter ounce if it wasn't a quarter

1178
03:58:18,260 --> 03:58:20,260
Us

1179
03:58:21,139 --> 03:58:26,180
All right, all right no more no more I demand silence again

1180
03:58:33,659 --> 03:58:58,270
Who's this boss? That's a really good image there. It's just what it looks like through his glasses take them off, dude

1181
03:59:20,780 --> 03:59:28,719
He looks so stupid

1182
03:59:28,719 --> 03:59:30,879
My it really is a minecraft skin

1183
03:59:43,950 --> 03:59:46,739
Either that or a powerade bottle

1184
04:00:02,129 --> 04:00:04,129
Blame thrower

1185
04:00:10,819 --> 04:00:15,979
Psychotic fucker time for a little pro bono ghost busting. All right

1186
04:00:27,420 --> 04:00:29,420
All right, what do you do who you moved

1187
04:00:30,379 --> 04:00:34,379
Let's see. You got a oh boy an overhead slash

1188
04:00:35,500 --> 04:00:38,139
Oh another overhead slash can't dodge it

1189
04:00:46,719 --> 04:00:48,719
Oh nice overhead slash

1190
04:00:50,530 --> 04:01:03,649
Oh magnetic

1191
04:01:05,250 --> 04:01:08,959
All right, don't be cocky here

1192
04:01:11,780 --> 04:01:23,940
I'm your later sounds

1193
04:01:24,420 --> 04:01:28,000
Trick to you. It's egypt

1194
04:01:30,610 --> 04:01:32,610
Oh fuck i'm gonna die

1195
04:01:32,610 --> 04:01:36,510
Get out of the way, man

1196
04:01:43,979 --> 04:01:50,299
Run, okay. I felt like I had a lot of health for a second there and now I don't have any

1197
04:01:51,420 --> 04:01:53,920
What happened?

1198
04:01:53,920 --> 04:01:58,209
He's got killed by a pyro

1199
04:01:58,530 --> 04:02:04,219
I got full. Um, okay

1200
04:02:05,860 --> 04:02:15,409
wall

1201
04:02:15,409 --> 04:02:17,090
F'ing stupid

1202
04:02:17,090 --> 04:02:27,649
All right, this is f'ing stupid

1203
04:02:28,129 --> 04:02:41,489
Dogs underneath it

1204
04:02:41,489 --> 04:02:47,489
Yes, I can

1205
04:02:49,809 --> 04:02:51,809
I can't tell if that's hurting me or not

1206
04:03:04,260 --> 04:03:15,899
All right, get out get out get out fire I think yeah, all right in

1207
04:03:32,639 --> 04:03:37,659
Fire, you know

1208
04:03:37,659 --> 04:03:39,420
Oh, I caught it

1209
04:03:39,420 --> 04:03:43,899
Hey, I was spinning my hand around

1210
04:03:44,700 --> 04:03:50,020
Dude, I was spinning around like crazy

1211
04:03:50,500 --> 04:04:26,260
Yeah, well i'm dead I go no you gotta spin you gotta spin it i'm just gonna just run around in a circle

1212
04:04:32,450 --> 04:04:40,770
Yeah, that's not hitting me

1213
04:04:41,889 --> 04:04:43,889
How do I get away from that one though

1214
04:04:45,010 --> 04:04:47,010
What if it's

1215
04:04:52,379 --> 04:04:57,500
There's so many stupid fucking boxes everywhere here they just block you fast let's destroy them all

1216
04:04:58,459 --> 04:05:04,520
Like just cut the whole fucking place down before you fight clear the wii area didn't you learn anything

1217
04:05:22,819 --> 04:05:24,819
I'm doing it

1218
04:05:32,059 --> 04:05:34,239
I can't block it

1219
04:05:34,479 --> 04:05:44,579
It's like when you move the camera moves with you. So it's like just kind of all over the place

1220
04:05:47,219 --> 04:05:51,139
If you want to dodge to the left it actually ends up making you dodge like in a weird place and you don't want to go

1221
04:05:58,860 --> 04:06:10,850
I'm gonna swing once and then run backwards. Let's do this. You have to get perfect dodges

1222
04:06:33,309 --> 04:06:46,159
So, okay is a perfect dodge actually hitting the dodge button or is it just side step

1223
04:06:58,850 --> 04:07:00,530
side step

1224
04:07:00,530 --> 04:07:05,389
Kind of hard to even tell if i'm dodging

1225
04:07:17,950 --> 04:07:19,950
Side slash is the one that's not dodging

1226
04:07:23,010 --> 04:07:25,010
Walk it right

1227
04:07:25,170 --> 04:07:28,180
Dodge at the right time, which would be

1228
04:07:30,690 --> 04:07:42,579
Through dark step is way harder in this game back in the action

1229
04:07:43,299 --> 04:07:51,819
Yeah, because isn't it like they raise their hand up and you run around i've done it once or twice already

1230
04:07:53,500 --> 04:08:01,180
Do I even have the give you have to lock it or something or no?

1231
04:08:17,170 --> 04:08:22,219
Area sucks such ass this area sucks such ass a lot of s's in that one

1232
04:08:38,430 --> 04:08:40,610
Say 10 times in a row

1233
04:08:40,610 --> 04:08:47,870
Serious sucks ass

1234
04:08:47,870 --> 04:08:55,760
Maybe it's that one. I have to dodge your own just dark step. I'm trying

1235
04:08:56,239 --> 04:09:00,909
It's just you just hit left right like there's no like the person plotting with it or just hit left

1236
04:09:01,629 --> 04:09:06,159
I'm just gonna close

1237
04:09:09,540 --> 04:09:12,180
I just did the exact same thing. I did last time I did it and it didn't do it

1238
04:09:12,420 --> 04:09:16,260
Oh

1239
04:09:25,729 --> 04:09:54,299
Can you center bar see you naked? I don't know. All right, here we go get the fuck out of the way

1240
04:09:54,620 --> 04:09:56,620
Oh this place sucks

1241
04:09:59,260 --> 04:10:01,819
Fucking objects everywhere you just bump into

1242
04:10:09,760 --> 04:10:14,399
No, and i'm trying to dodge the other way and you can't you can't do that

1243
04:10:15,360 --> 04:10:17,360
because your body

1244
04:10:18,159 --> 04:10:43,500
I'm trying to dodge left. Why is it going backwards?

1245
04:10:44,700 --> 04:10:46,700
This is a mess

1246
04:10:51,920 --> 04:11:23,219
Dark stuff don't work. I okay i'm trying what the fuck

1247
04:11:32,350 --> 04:11:38,180
Forget the dodge just

1248
04:11:43,090 --> 04:11:46,770
That's what i'm talking about back in the action with the health chest

1249
04:11:47,809 --> 04:11:49,569
No, that wasn't a good run

1250
04:11:49,569 --> 04:11:57,659
Okay, i'm just gonna cheese the fuck out of this boss because I hate this boss. I don't like it

1251
04:11:58,860 --> 04:12:00,860
I don't like this area. I don't like this boss

1252
04:12:01,899 --> 04:12:07,020
Stupid it's fucking stupid. This boss is fucking stupid. The game's fucking stupid. Really mothers are stupid

1253
04:12:28,299 --> 04:12:31,260
Do another fucking move. What the hell?

1254
04:12:32,399 --> 04:13:00,500
what

1255
04:13:06,079 --> 04:13:17,729
Fire my god, this the fucking lock-on is just so stupid here

1256
04:13:19,420 --> 04:13:22,219
It's such a dumb fucking area where it's just

1257
04:13:26,159 --> 04:13:28,159
Actually mad. Yeah

1258
04:13:28,239 --> 04:13:30,239
It's fucking stupid

1259
04:13:30,479 --> 04:13:57,780
What?

1260
04:13:57,780 --> 04:14:13,170
Get up burn the gotcha force disc

1261
04:14:13,729 --> 04:14:19,620
How how do you actually avoid getting hit by that?

1262

You actually burning. Oh my fucking god just run around the circle. I think I don't know. Is it working?

1263
04:14:39,440 --> 04:14:45,459

04:16:09,819 --> 04:16:11,819
Why are you in here?

1272

All right, let's see that image fuck off

1282
04:18:32,510 --> 04:18:34,510

What's a kid doing here what's that whoa that was a kid

1284

This is the problem with fighting the supernatural you cannot kill someone who's already dead

1285
04:19:04,909 --> 04:19:06,909
Okay, are you on the pipe

1286
04:19:12,180 --> 04:19:18,879
It's absolutely perfect left to die in this house as the story goes he made a pact with the devil with his final breath

1287
04:19:19,440 --> 04:19:25,479
Revive through the dark arts the child murdered his parents and now rules this forest a felenting regs

1288
04:19:25,479 --> 04:19:27,479
Thanks for the five community subs

1289
04:19:28,040 --> 04:19:30,840
Assassins have fucked up somehow or we wouldn't be in this profession

1290
04:19:31,600 --> 04:19:33,600
Nothing surprises me anymore

1291
04:19:33,879 --> 04:19:39,959
Now you are ranked 24th still a ways to go until the top you are not getting tired

1292

Huh? I haven't even broken a sweat. Why don't you bring me a real challenge?

1293
04:19:46,079 --> 04:19:48,079
24 omega low

1294
04:19:48,879 --> 04:20:07,030
Boss was dumb. I will not let anybody sit here and tell me that that boss wasn't dumb

1295
04:20:14,450 --> 04:20:21,920
Very dumb

1296
04:21:05,680 --> 04:21:07,680
Oh

1297
04:21:24,379 --> 04:21:37,120
If the people left when you did that they'll be back when I get it last boss and beat it in three swings

1298
04:21:38,120 --> 04:21:47,450

And they say

1311
04:23:46,139 --> 04:23:51,309
That's a huge amount of money. Mr. Frito. We are all a part of a single consciousness

1312
04:23:51,950 --> 04:23:58,709
Split into micro realities to experience a single reality in an infinite number of times and ways in the infinite flow of reality

1313
04:23:59,270 --> 04:24:03,190
All of us have converged in this single point in a repeating time

1314
04:24:03,190 --> 04:24:07,149
But to watch German get mad at this game instead of playing pat upon to shake in my head to be honest, man

1315
04:24:08,270 --> 04:24:18,940
Won't be go. I'm it's a fun game. I gotta break my record

1322
04:25:50,899 --> 04:25:57,319
Let's go just more mini games the funnest part of this whole entire franchise

1323
04:25:58,139 --> 04:26:05,170
They have these in the PC one getting trashed is now available

1324
04:26:05,889 --> 04:26:23,809
Okay getting trashed. We cleaned our streets by rocketing all of our garbage into space

1325
04:26:24,450 --> 04:26:27,889
It worked like a charm, but now the trash could fall back to earth and kill us

1326
04:26:28,290 --> 04:26:32,629
We don't really didn't really think that through. Will you go into space and collect the floating junk?

1327
04:26:33,149 --> 04:26:36,959
How about all the debris floating in space and store it in your space shuttle?

1328
04:26:37,479 --> 04:26:43,329
They'll dump it in the ocean or something later use your air jet boosters to control your position to take some skill

1329
04:26:43,889 --> 04:26:48,149
You get too close to Earth's atmosphere. You'd be pulled in by the gravity. Be careful

1330
04:26:48,729 --> 04:26:58,819
I'll be careful getting trashed turn on air boosters release

1331
04:26:59,840 --> 04:27:01,840

Oh, I got a meat boost. Yeah, that was pretty good

1338
04:29:05,540 --> 04:29:11,079
10,000 you guys ever wish that isaac newton didn't invent gravity

1339
04:29:15,360 --> 04:29:22,100
What he's patented it? That's already had a patent on gravity

1340
04:29:28,200 --> 04:29:29,639

Had to use all of them

1473
04:54:17,490 --> 04:54:19,729
All right. This one's not time for money

1474
04:54:20,610 --> 04:54:25,090
It's not efficient at all. This is not efficient. This is very inefficient actually

1475

Done connected. Thank you. You're too relaxed

1509
04:58:37,950 --> 04:58:39,950
Why is it a bad thing?

1510
04:58:43,229 --> 04:58:45,229
3000 minus 2000

1511
04:58:46,689 --> 04:59:07,419
Speed run time. Um

1512
04:59:13,599 --> 04:59:14,799
Should I

1513
04:59:14,799 --> 04:59:17,090
Just go

1514
04:59:17,090 --> 04:59:29,419
I'm trying to go times two speed. I'm trying. Okay, and then we go

1515
04:59:30,540 --> 04:59:36,590
Uh this way. No. Yeah, I need some straight pieces

1516
04:59:37,150 --> 04:59:57,099

04:59:57,340 --> 04:59:59,020
Okay, that's fine

1518
04:59:59,020 --> 05:00:03,680
Is that fine?

1519
05:00:03,680 --> 05:00:09,310
That's fine, right? I think

1520
05:00:13,090 --> 05:00:26,860
We'll find out and then we turn up this way and then we go

1521
05:00:27,419 --> 05:00:29,419
Oh, we missed one

1522
05:00:29,419 --> 05:00:33,360
I missed one

1523
05:00:33,360 --> 05:00:34,400
Oh well

1524
05:00:34,400 --> 05:00:36,819
That doesn't have to be perfect. You just have to get do it

1525
05:00:37,700 --> 05:01:30,740
Wait, I got i'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Everything's fine

1526
05:01:31,299 --> 05:01:32,659
I just have to

1527
05:01:32,659 --> 05:01:38,139
Go like this

1528
05:01:38,139 --> 05:01:40,139
Oh shit, it's not fine

1529
05:01:43,119 --> 05:01:49,250
Has to curve into here

1530
05:01:49,250 --> 05:01:51,490
What the whether you're not pieces

1531
05:01:53,659 --> 05:01:55,659
Take the middle part that you're not using

1532
05:01:56,610 --> 05:01:58,130
middle part

1533
05:01:58,130 --> 05:02:02,450
Where we mean?

1534
05:02:02,450 --> 05:02:04,849

1535
05:02:04,849 --> 05:02:06,849
I need to undo the curve

1536
05:02:06,930 --> 05:02:16,529
The green piece in the middle

1537
05:02:16,529 --> 05:02:19,220
I can't wait

1538
05:02:19,220 --> 05:02:21,220
Okay, but I still know I still can't do it

1539
05:02:24,189 --> 05:02:29,939
There always has to be one over here. I screwed it up

1540
05:02:30,740 --> 05:02:33,810
It's an unused curve

1541
05:02:33,889 --> 05:02:36,819
Where?

1542
05:02:36,819 --> 05:02:38,259
Yeah up there

1543
05:02:38,259 --> 05:02:40,259
Yep, I had to go through that

1544
05:02:44,430 --> 05:02:46,830
Can't move the guys. You can't move green pieces

1545
05:02:49,020 --> 05:02:51,020
I can't pick up the green pieces

1546
05:03:07,500 --> 05:03:09,900
Stop prolonging it. Fine. I'll just let the water hit me in the face

1547
05:03:13,090 --> 05:03:14,610
Come on. I can do it

1548
05:03:14,610 --> 05:03:19,020
Come on

1549
05:03:29,250 --> 05:03:44,700
So don't retry don't don't do those sounds anymore though. I like doing those sounds i'm gonna keep doing them

1550
05:03:45,740 --> 05:03:48,930
I'm gonna keep doing those sounds. I like those sounds i'm gonna do them

1551
05:03:50,240 --> 05:04:09,259
All right, how about pizza with avengers do five minutes of cat puking sounds? That's probably I don't think people would want that

1552
05:04:10,700 --> 05:04:12,220
Okay

1553
05:04:12,220 --> 05:04:18,750

Stay in the middle. Watch out cares about the nitrous. So I almost got it. Sorry

This should be clean money. I want to play the montana max again

1558
05:05:06,139 --> 05:05:11,869

1560
05:05:14,029 --> 05:05:17,490

05:06:16,909 --> 05:06:27,409
Go watch cars, man

1568
05:06:27,650 --> 05:06:39,919
Careful. Oh

1569
05:06:40,080 --> 05:06:42,619

1570
05:06:42,619 --> 05:06:52,270

No, it's too fast

05:10:06,639 --> 05:10:08,639
You have to pull as hard as you can to the other side

1589
05:10:08,720 --> 05:10:15,099
But if you're not in the right spot when road just rips in a direction, you're gonna get fucking crushed

05:14:24,639 --> 05:14:36,000
Like what is it about it? Would you get blue? Would you guys eat a purple steak?

1615
05:14:36,720 --> 05:14:47,360
If the top and bottom was seared and inside was purple, would you eat it? Oh, yes, it'll melt in your mouth

1616
05:14:48,000 --> 05:14:50,000

05:17:54,849 --> 05:18:02,779

This reminds me of the uh ghostbusters game. Holy shit. That was horrible. That hurt me looking at that

1643
05:18:44,189 --> 05:18:54,689
Change the subject. What do you mean?

05:18:54,930 --> 05:19:07,540

All these streams would be improved if you were just sitting on the toilet one day

1656

Because you wouldn't even have to get up to go to the bathroom. You could just piss right into the bowl

1660
05:21:29,540 --> 05:21:32,659
I wouldn't have to get up. I would just just mute my microphone and make sure that the camera's on

1661
05:21:48,029 --> 05:21:50,029
The camera

I don't want new clothes though. I like the clothes I have now

1673
05:22:54,959 --> 05:22:57,200
Because I just spend all my money

1674
05:23:09,709 --> 05:23:16,900
These threads suck. I don't have enough money for this

1675
05:23:19,970 --> 05:23:21,650
I'll take it

1676

1686
05:24:31,659 --> 05:24:44,909
Wait, do I am I accidentally doing this? I thought I said I was dead

1687
05:25:01,979 --> 05:25:03,659
Am I dead?

1688
05:25:03,659 --> 05:25:05,259

What is this bullshit? It's it's if not a mini game. It's a

1814
05:44:38,770 --> 05:44:56,459
This sucks. This is intentional. That was a blue scorpion. Is that worth more?

1815
05:45:10,979 --> 05:45:14,500
We're the scorpions

1816
05:45:23,340 --> 05:45:34,939

And keep playing it. I think it's a lot of fun

1829
05:46:41,020 --> 05:46:43,020
It's very quality

1830
05:46:44,110 --> 05:46:51,229
This puts us right exactly at about the five to six hour mark, which is exactly what I thought was going to happen

1831
05:46:51,229 --> 05:46:52,509
And that's good

1832
05:46:52,509 --> 05:46:57,439

1839
05:47:25,810 --> 05:47:28,610
For the wallace and grommet grand adventures. They both made by telltale

1840
05:47:29,729 --> 05:47:31,569
No, i'm not really into the

1841
05:47:31,569 --> 05:47:33,869
home star runner thing

1842
05:47:33,869 --> 05:47:35,869

1843
05:47:37,360 --> 05:47:38,240
um

1844
05:47:38,240 --> 05:47:40,240
But wallace and grommet though

1845
05:47:40,560 --> 05:47:46,880
Got me interested

1846
05:47:46,880 --> 05:47:48,880
You do have me interested in wallace and grommet, of course

1847
05:47:54,000 --> 05:47:56,000
Probably very easy

1848
05:47:56,000 --> 05:47:58,000
designed for children

1849
05:48:00,259 --> 05:48:02,259

1850
05:48:03,470 --> 05:48:05,470
Hey gnarly, thanks for the 250

1851
05:48:05,630 --> 05:48:07,869
Speaking of games you haven't played yet that you intend to

I've been putting this one off for months

1859
05:48:27,229 --> 05:48:29,459
I'm happy to play it

1860
05:48:29,459 --> 05:48:32,180
One game at a time and then resident evil 3 is after this

1861
05:48:32,900 --> 05:48:34,900
So i've got a i've got quite a backlog

Let's see. What was the thing? Oh tiny and tiny toad adventures. Uh, my summer sports

1863
05:48:44,880 --> 05:48:46,880
Another one that has to happen immediately

1864
05:48:51,650 --> 05:48:57,090
Yeah, hey smelly boy. Thanks for the 250. What do you think is the worst chat? We hate this game

1865
05:48:58,380 --> 05:49:02,139
What is what do you think is the worst chat? We hate this game saying veto or next

1866
05:49:03,490 --> 05:49:05,650
Also, please bring back next

1867
05:49:06,130 --> 05:49:11,009
Uh, it would depth next is way worse because I created that that's my own fault

1868
05:49:12,049 --> 05:49:16,770
Veto is just hey, i'm gonna veto this. Oh, you're gonna veto that next was like a joke

1869
05:49:18,049 --> 05:49:19,090
that

1870
05:49:19,090 --> 05:49:22,049
I created that monster with the fucking ipad string

1871
05:49:25,950 --> 05:49:37,490
That's where it came from so I would say next that emote existed for less than 30 days

1872
05:49:38,209 --> 05:49:40,209
And I was no no

1876
05:49:55,580 --> 05:49:57,819
I think travis will be one of the dlc characters

1877
05:50:01,380 --> 05:50:03,740
I'm pretty sure that'll happen

1878
05:50:04,849 --> 05:50:09,069
Followed by the three stooges as one character

1879
05:50:14,400 --> 05:50:16,400
What if they did the three stooges?

1880
05:50:17,119 --> 05:50:19,119

1881
05:50:19,279 --> 05:50:25,599

I'm just like my brain is down here in the middle of the chest and my heart is up in the brain

1901
05:52:26,450 --> 05:52:28,450
And then it's way bigger up there

1902
05:52:28,689 --> 05:52:30,930
And then the brain is tiny. It's like the size of the heart

1903
05:52:32,220 --> 05:52:39,459
They flipped they're in the wrong places

1904
05:52:39,459 --> 05:52:44,659

1917
05:53:43,970 --> 05:53:47,490
Hearing you read my sex dream message out loud on the new year's eve

Domino's eight dollar large pizza carryout seriously though eight dollar large is a steal

1923
05:54:18,779 --> 05:54:22,060
Especially since little caesar's is five to six dollars and it didn't even fresh

05:54:37,439 --> 05:54:41,979
What do you want me to say? Oh, that's not worth it. It probably is. Yeah, what am I gonna say? No

1928
05:54:42,779 --> 05:54:52,000
In some places it's like 16 17 bucks for a large. It's like 15 plus dollars for a large in a lot of places

1929
05:54:56,700 --> 05:54:58,700
Do I like domino's? No

1930
05:54:58,779 --> 05:55:00,779
Do I think domino's is gross?

1931
05:55:00,779 --> 05:55:05,979
Yeah, maybe kind of if I was presented with domino's and we said hey, I got domino's

1932
05:55:06,990 --> 05:55:13,299
I'd I'd be like, okay, this is fine. Now i'll lead it. What do I love? No, I don't love it

1933
05:55:14,020 --> 05:55:15,540

05:56:35,389 --> 05:56:51,680
That was about to be that rap that's the part they're talking about

1945
05:56:56,380 --> 05:57:03,220
I don't remember doing any of these things. I remember that

05:57:04,020 --> 05:57:07,150
How many times have I fallen out a window?

They've flown away. They've flown off

1953
05:57:35,860 --> 05:57:38,099
Some people know that it exists and they don't even know that

1954
05:57:38,900 --> 05:57:46,220
I exist which is fine. I'm that's fine with me. It's it's taken on it's its own thing now. It's

1955
05:57:49,020 --> 05:57:50,700
It's become its own

1956
05:57:50,700 --> 05:57:54,619
Little fun thing that people think is fun and cool and I like that that's i'm happy about that

So people show me hey, what do you think about this? This person put the rats here

05:58:22,099 --> 05:58:26,659
Um, I don't I don't think we can do that

1962
05:58:27,220 --> 05:58:33,090

1964
05:58:39,409 --> 05:58:41,409
All right, you guys realize something

1965
05:58:42,240 --> 05:58:44,400
If kim and I were up to our own vices

We would eat mcdonald's three times a week

1967

I would eat mcdonald's two or three times a week

1968
05:58:51,549 --> 05:58:53,150
If it was like

1969
05:58:53,150 --> 05:58:56,930
I mean, I guess I could couldn't I I could

1970
05:58:57,569 --> 05:59:07,619
Do americans really?

1971
05:59:07,779 --> 05:59:11,790
Yeah, we love it. We love it

1972
05:59:14,560 --> 05:59:22,799
Kim and I get so excited going to mcdonald's you guys um, everyone. Oh, wow. I wonder what like expensive tastes the streamer has

1973
05:59:23,680 --> 05:59:27,520
Put I bet you he eats lobsters and getting and crab dips

1974
05:59:28,240 --> 05:59:30,240
No, no, we get excited

1975
05:59:30,639 --> 05:59:32,639
In the drive-thru to mcdonald's

1976
05:59:33,619 --> 05:59:40,220
That's what excites us. We don't wonder that well now you now you do

1977
05:59:40,860 --> 05:59:43,740
Nobody wonders that yes, they do somebody somebody does

1978
05:59:44,380 --> 05:59:47,139
I'm sure one of you did

1979
05:59:47,139 --> 05:59:49,139
One of you beamed that into my head

1980
05:59:51,599 --> 05:59:55,200
Expensive taste says the guy that loves steak. Um, so we didn't think this

1981
05:59:58,000 --> 06:00:00,240
Oh, yeah, all the evidence has kind of just been there, huh?

1982
06:00:06,939 --> 06:00:09,659
Whatever who cares it's I love mcdonald's

1983
06:00:11,139 --> 06:00:13,200
I love that place

1984
06:00:13,200 --> 06:00:17,759
Back when I was a kid like the play place you could play there. There was like all kinds of toys

1985
06:00:20,939 --> 06:00:25,659
You go in the ball pit and stuff and then the hamburgers were awesome and the chicken nuggets

1986
06:00:26,299 --> 06:00:37,759
But I don't do this anymore. I advise everybody call me a child. I don't go to the ball pit anymore

1987
06:00:42,830 --> 06:00:46,509
Oh god, i'm about to get fucking i'm about to get roasted right now

1988
06:00:47,900 --> 06:00:48,779
Bingo sunshine

1989
06:00:48,779 --> 06:00:55,099
Thanks for the 250 blaming cbd for making you misinterpret the position of the light blue block in the second image

1990
06:00:55,659 --> 06:00:57,900
It's like when teens give someone a joint

1991
06:00:58,540 --> 06:01:02,540
With just plain grass in it so that they'll pretend they're getting high, of course

1992
06:01:03,419 --> 06:01:08,479
As I was writing this you clarified that there is actually thc in the oil you're using so i'm the clown

1993
06:01:14,529 --> 06:01:18,290
I was certain that there wasn't going to be any mind using things today

1994
06:01:22,139 --> 06:01:29,580
Donald is beta fast food. That's unbelievable. Oh, come on. The big back is the best thing ever. Um

1995
06:01:31,409 --> 06:01:33,009
Now if you weren't here

1996
06:01:33,009 --> 06:01:34,369
I have been

1997
06:01:34,369 --> 06:01:35,169
uh

1998
06:01:35,169 --> 06:01:38,049
small dosing

1999
06:01:39,369 --> 06:01:43,659
Cbd with thc in it or to try to

2000
06:01:45,119 --> 06:01:47,119
Shut my nerve pain up

2001
06:01:51,689 --> 06:01:53,689
Osteochondritis is incredibly annoying

2002
06:01:54,509 --> 06:01:57,790
Seeing if it works seeing if it calms it down a little bit

2003
06:01:59,549 --> 06:02:02,990
He's baby dosing yeah, no, I don't want to i'm not looking to

2004
06:02:03,630 --> 06:02:19,220
I'm not gonna get messed up weed laughing my ass off. I guess he's micro dosing weed

2005
06:02:21,119 --> 06:02:23,119
Yeah, i'm just losing up a pain relief

2006
06:02:23,520 --> 06:02:26,240
I'm testing it to see if it helps her with pain relief

2007
06:02:28,619 --> 06:02:30,380
What's wrong with that?

2008
06:02:30,380 --> 06:02:42,590
Is it working? I can't tell you that it is or isn't because i've only

2009
06:02:43,470 --> 06:02:46,639
It's only been something i've been doing for a couple of days

2010
06:02:47,520 --> 06:02:48,560
so

2011
06:02:48,560 --> 06:02:52,159
I'm gonna see what small doses of this does every once in a while

2012
06:02:53,040 --> 06:02:54,319
See if it helps

2013
06:02:54,319 --> 06:03:00,340
We'll see

2014
06:03:00,340 --> 06:03:02,419
Smoke weed instead. I don't want that much

2015
06:03:02,959 --> 06:03:06,029
Ehc

2016
06:03:06,029 --> 06:03:08,479
I don't want that much

2017
06:03:08,479 --> 06:03:10,479
because what i'm doing right now is

2018
06:03:11,040 --> 06:03:13,040
Only a couple of milligrams

2019
06:03:13,729 --> 06:03:15,729
So I don't really want

2020
06:03:17,169 --> 06:03:19,490
You guys thought I had a problem with the children's puzzle today

2021
06:03:21,580 --> 06:03:27,630
I don't think I would be capable of live streaming. I mean like oh, yeah when gerber has a few drinks

2022
06:03:28,029 --> 06:03:32,990
Oh, yeah, he's drunk and he said he only he's look. Oh, look what he did. He look what he's saying

2023
06:03:32,990 --> 06:03:34,990
You know, look at the stream. It's fun

2024
06:03:35,630 --> 06:03:39,790
If I were to be like a higher so I don't want to do that. That would be fun. I

2025
06:03:40,590 --> 06:03:43,580
I'm, not sure that would work

2026
06:03:43,580 --> 06:03:47,259
I would forget I was streaming and sit here and just kind of I don't I wouldn't even talk to you guys

2027
06:03:47,740 --> 06:03:59,330
I'm, not sure I want to do that. Of course. He's a lightweight. He's five two

2028
06:04:01,939 --> 06:04:04,020
I don't want to take in a bunch of thc

2029
06:04:08,700 --> 06:04:12,540
Well, I don't want to be completely like screwed up

2030
06:04:14,419 --> 06:04:18,020
I'm doing it for a therapeutic measure not to

2031
06:04:19,500 --> 06:04:21,500
Talk about how big the solar system is

2032
06:04:22,060 --> 06:04:29,419
Although what we did that today we talked about aliens, right? What do we we did? What did we talk about today something weird?

2033
06:04:30,060 --> 06:04:35,099
We did that today. We did something weird today. What did I do?

2034
06:04:36,750 --> 06:04:38,750
Long story short, we'll see how it goes in a week

2035
06:04:39,950 --> 06:04:45,020

Enter the pseudiverse

2038
06:04:55,540 --> 06:05:00,580
You could replace half of the characters that suda comes up with with germa rumble characters

2039
06:05:02,830 --> 06:05:04,830
It's kind of his germa rumble

2040
06:05:05,659 --> 06:05:08,700
Uh, what do I want to make? Uh, a mutant man

2041

There's a guy. There's a mutant

2042
06:05:11,680 --> 06:05:13,680
He's got horns coming out of his ass

2043

All right. Perfect. Can you guys can we make that feel like that's kind of what he does

Yeah, hey robo fussing. Thanks for the 250 you changed after that week long cbd binge, bro

2046
06:05:44,930 --> 06:05:55,729

06:05:55,729 --> 06:06:00,849
Bementing dregs. Thanks for 20 dollars 2 000 bits. I tried playing tf2 just had a curiosity recently

2048
06:06:01,330 --> 06:06:03,090
after a long absence

2049
06:06:03,090 --> 06:06:07,889
I had at least a thousand hours in the game prior and one guy was like

2050
06:06:08,529 --> 06:06:10,450
Have you played before?

2051
06:06:10,450 --> 06:06:15,330
When our team lost so basically the community is what I remember if you rejoin it

2052
06:06:16,299 --> 06:06:22,779
It will be like the chat dude. Have you played before?

2053
06:06:25,919 --> 06:06:27,919
No, that you said always say no

2054
06:06:29,220 --> 06:06:32,419
Don't get don't get defensive to that say no. This is my first time

2055
06:06:33,060 --> 06:06:34,830
because then that person

2056
06:06:34,830 --> 06:06:36,590
from then on out will

2057
06:06:36,590 --> 06:06:44,830
You've had that you're at the bottom there anything you do after that would be like, oh this guy's a fucking fast learner. Holy shit

2058
06:06:45,389 --> 06:06:51,229
He top frags. This is like a second game. Whoa, I respect this guy

2059
06:06:52,990 --> 06:07:00,189
And then 10 years later when they're the best man at your wedding you can tell them this story man

2060
06:07:00,189 --> 06:07:15,779
We were almost enemies. Thanks for the 20 bucks though. Hey ruined bloodline. Thanks for the five dollars germa

2061
06:07:15,779 --> 06:07:21,259
Please say something funny. I lost almost all my money investing in germa stocks and I need to make that money back

2062
06:07:21,259 --> 06:07:33,340
Please I beg you trading germa

2063
06:07:34,060 --> 06:07:36,060
germa comedy currency

2064
06:07:36,619 --> 06:07:42,659
Because I am not a comedy advisor. I am not somebody to tell you when you should and should

2065
06:07:44,180 --> 06:07:46,180
Should and should not laugh at a joke

2066
06:07:46,659 --> 06:07:51,470
I can't tell you those things you have to be in control of that and you are it's not nothing to do with me

2067
06:07:54,270 --> 06:07:56,270
all I can say is

2068
06:07:58,819 --> 06:08:03,680
Nothing, that's I've said what I needed to say. Thanks for the five dollars

2069
06:08:05,139 --> 06:08:10,669
Prating just be careful. There. It's a wild world out there

2070
06:08:14,180 --> 06:08:18,900
A soup gg. Thanks for the 250 germa. I enjoyed your diablo 2 playthrough

2071
06:08:19,380 --> 06:08:21,380
But I think it had the worst joke of the decade

2072
06:08:21,779 --> 06:08:27,520
And no one's brought it up yet. It made me physically cringe when I heard it. What are you talking about?

2073
06:08:27,759 --> 06:08:31,340
What is what's doing? What's so bad about this?

2074
06:08:34,450 --> 06:08:39,349
Turn around what are you getting to the person behind you spaghetti turn around mr. Spaghetti

2075
06:08:42,319 --> 06:08:44,319
This is the worst joke of the decade

2076
06:08:45,419 --> 06:08:49,740
What are you getting to the person behind you spaghetti turn around mr. Spaghetti?

2077
06:08:54,299 --> 06:08:58,299
Um, I don't know how new you are to the channel, but you're gonna have an issue every single day

2078
06:09:01,250 --> 06:09:04,930
What you have just linked me I believe happens 30 to 40 times

2079
06:09:05,869 --> 06:09:11,069
An hour on this stream. I don't know. I'm not sure you're gonna be

2080
06:09:11,790 --> 06:09:15,409
I'm not sure you're gonna want to

2081
06:09:15,409 --> 06:09:18,139
uh

2082
06:09:18,139 --> 06:09:21,380
How dare you?

2083
06:09:21,380 --> 06:09:23,939
Those are the only jokes he made that's not even true

2084
06:09:26,110 --> 06:09:28,110
I make equal parts

2085
06:09:28,110 --> 06:09:30,110
Say a name and a noise

2086
06:09:30,349 --> 06:09:33,330
Versus like let me tell you this

2087
06:09:33,330 --> 06:09:36,290
I'll give me some credit here. I deserve it. I deserve this credit

2088
06:09:37,520 --> 06:09:43,380
50 of the jokes are a name and a place a noun and a verb noun and a verb

2089
06:09:43,860 --> 06:09:48,419
Mr. Noun and a verb mr. Verb and a noun. Yeah, okay. Yeah, but the other half

2090
06:09:50,000 --> 06:10:03,650
Are carefully crafted scenarios and crafted comedy. Don't forget being bad at the game and ranting like an idiot

2091
06:10:04,130 --> 06:10:17,759
No ranting like a philosopher being bad at the game is not on purpose

2092
06:10:18,479 --> 06:10:25,389
Is it making me realize the germ is always high?

2093
06:10:25,389 --> 06:10:27,889
I

2094
06:10:28,209 --> 06:10:31,790

2095
06:10:31,790 --> 06:10:33,790

2129
06:13:34,560 --> 06:13:35,680
We'll see

2130
06:13:35,680 --> 06:13:39,840
This dude can handle a long sword pretty well

2131
06:13:41,069 --> 06:13:46,590
Can you we'll find out on the stream that will never happen?

2132
06:13:47,939 --> 06:13:49,939
That means Joel and I have to

2133
06:13:50,930 --> 06:13:54,060
Do it and we'll see if that happens

2134
06:13:56,209 --> 06:14:01,409
Hey c4g, thanks for the 250. I miss animal crossing. Can you bring her back, please? I miss her so much

2135
06:14:01,490 --> 06:14:03,490
I miss animal crossing. Thank you, sir

2136
06:14:03,810 --> 06:14:05,409
Uh, no

2137
06:14:05,409 --> 06:14:09,619
Remember that if we're gonna do the bitch and i'm gonna fucking do play animal crossing that ended

2138
06:14:10,020 --> 06:14:12,900
Uh during the move when it's the only thing me and kim had to do

2139
06:14:13,979 --> 06:14:15,740
And then now it's done

2140
06:14:15,740 --> 06:14:23,009
played it twice

2141
06:14:23,009 --> 06:14:25,009
On stream. I played it twice

2142
06:14:25,409 --> 06:14:28,049
Off stream. I played it probably a couple dozen times

2143
06:14:28,849 --> 06:14:35,860
Hey control x thanks for the 420. Thanks for the stream

2144
06:14:36,500 --> 06:14:37,700
jerry

2145
06:14:37,700 --> 06:14:39,299
uh being a

2146
06:14:39,299 --> 06:14:45,299
Hema fencer who can't sword fight due to corona. It's refreshing to see some epic lightsaber on

2147
06:14:46,500 --> 06:14:47,700
action

2148
06:14:47,700 --> 06:14:54,819

06:15:15,200 --> 06:15:17,200
I feel like I want to have that

2152
06:15:18,000 --> 06:15:20,000
I want that to be the title of the stream

2153
06:15:20,479 --> 06:15:22,479
Will I get into trouble if I have that be the title?

2154
06:15:24,750 --> 06:15:27,790
I feel like somebody would be not happy about that

2155
06:15:29,599 --> 06:15:34,080
420 easy baked mouth oven micro dose lsd stream

2156
06:15:34,639 --> 06:15:38,740
I wonder i'm gonna run that by twitch to see if I could fucking have that

2157
06:15:40,990 --> 06:15:45,090

that's um

2169
06:16:33,759 --> 06:16:36,110
Doesn't seem correct

2170
06:16:36,110 --> 06:16:38,270
That's did one person sub

2171
06:16:40,770 --> 06:16:42,290
What is this?

2172
06:16:42,290 --> 06:16:48,799
Did anybody sub?

2173
06:16:49,200 --> 06:16:51,200

2174
06:16:54,990 --> 06:17:07,970
I'd sub

2175
06:17:07,970 --> 06:17:12,939
Well, I can read them

2176
06:17:12,939 --> 06:17:14,540

I told you stream labs is fucked up. Hey, even if it was five

2184
06:17:50,830 --> 06:17:53,150
Still five people that decided to give me five dollars today

2185
06:17:55,279 --> 06:17:57,279
Or we'll pay five dollars

2186
06:17:58,430 --> 06:17:59,470
All right

2187
06:17:59,470 --> 06:18:01,069
Even if it was five

2188
06:18:01,069 --> 06:18:03,439
That's still a lot of people

2189
06:18:09,099 --> 06:18:10,700
We have few more bits to do

2190
06:18:10,700 --> 06:18:13,659
I don't know why that happened but stream labs is kind of messed up tonight for some reason

2191
06:18:14,849 --> 06:18:17,810
Uh nearshut thanks with a thousand bits. When is the resident evil four stream?

2192
06:18:18,900 --> 06:18:20,900
Roughly praise the mighty jera

2193
06:18:22,049 --> 06:18:25,439
uh

2194
06:18:25,439 --> 06:18:31,759
Um, let's see no more heroes two tomorrow if I don't finish no more heroes two tomorrow

2195
06:18:32,319 --> 06:18:34,639
And finish no more heroes two on wednesday

2196
06:18:35,779 --> 06:18:40,479
And then potentially after completing no more heroes two tiny tunes adventures

2197
06:18:41,119 --> 06:18:42,319
summer

2198
06:18:42,319 --> 06:18:46,159
Vacation and that stream and then thursday resident evil three

2199
06:18:46,720 --> 06:18:47,919
or if I

2200
06:18:47,919 --> 06:18:49,419
beat

2201
06:18:49,419 --> 06:18:56,299
The game tomorrow no more heroes two resident evil three on wednesday and then thursday is tiny tune adventures. Here we go

2202
06:18:57,950 --> 06:19:00,159
then monday

2203
06:19:00,159 --> 06:19:06,240
Uh, I want community community content. I on me the probably the middle of the week on from the 11th to the 13th somewhere like that

2204
06:19:07,360 --> 06:19:08,639
then

2205
06:19:08,639 --> 06:19:12,979
No community content. It's gonna be thursday, right? I remember this

2206
06:19:14,479 --> 06:19:15,840
um

2207
06:19:15,840 --> 06:19:18,959
So the 11 12, uh, let's let's say july 30th

2208
06:19:19,680 --> 06:19:22,560
I think there's enough time for me to read that. Oh, okay market

2209
06:19:28,509 --> 06:19:34,419
Yeah, that makes sense. Hey, yes xd. Thanks for the five dollars germ

2210
06:19:34,419 --> 06:19:37,380
I just want to say that there's nothing wrong with not wanting to play tf2

2211
06:19:37,939 --> 06:19:39,939
You've made content before for years

2212
06:19:40,020 --> 06:19:43,380
I totally understand if you feel like you've had enough of the game don't let chat get to you

2213
06:19:43,380 --> 06:19:45,380
I'm sure they're all just joking good work

2214
06:19:47,500 --> 06:19:49,500
No, I just don't I

2215
06:19:51,659 --> 06:19:54,860
I just I don't it's not like i'll never play the game for the rest of my life

2216
06:19:55,740 --> 06:20:00,220
I don't know. I typically would if they come up with something if there's a new update or if they said

2217
06:20:00,860 --> 06:20:04,380
New one or something else to talk about or do or then I would probably try it

2218
06:20:05,259 --> 06:20:08,779
Or just please say slash s

2219
06:20:10,240 --> 06:20:13,200
But I have don't don't have any intention to play it

2220
06:20:16,540 --> 06:20:17,900
I spent

2221
06:20:17,900 --> 06:20:21,900
A decade playing that game and it was it was the best game i've probably ever played

2222
06:20:22,619 --> 06:20:26,110
But you know, I don't it's just not something I really want to do

2223
06:20:27,580 --> 06:20:31,790
I don't know. You gotta pretty missed a frog coin. Nice

2224
06:20:35,139 --> 06:20:39,220
Hey bingo sunshine. Thanks for the 250. What are you fiddling with in the background? We can hear it

2225
06:20:41,540 --> 06:20:43,340
uh batteries

2226
06:20:43,340 --> 06:20:53,069
It's batteries. I always have batteries here for some reason

2227
06:20:54,189 --> 06:21:00,430
Uh mu means mu. Thanks for three dollars cardboard cutout made of clay. This streamer is really suited on a micro dose

2228
06:21:01,549 --> 06:21:05,810
This is like this is like seven hours ago now guys

2229
06:21:08,580 --> 06:21:14,580
You're referencing that you're referencing something that happened like potentially almost a whole day ago like eight hours ago

2230
06:21:20,529 --> 06:21:22,450
nearly a year ago

2231
06:21:22,450 --> 06:21:27,520
And finally, I will see you guys tomorrow

2232
06:21:28,080 --> 06:21:29,919
for more normal heroes, too

2233
06:21:29,919 --> 06:21:33,419
The blast is always

2234
06:21:33,419 --> 06:21:37,220
C4g. Thanks for the 250. I miss

2235
06:21:37,919 --> 06:21:39,919
animalated crossing, please

2236
06:21:40,180 --> 06:21:43,540
Let me get an island tour, sir. Let me see the animals one more time

2237
06:21:43,540 --> 06:21:47,139
I miss the funny cow and phoebe and the other one the monkey that one

2238
06:21:54,700 --> 06:21:56,700
They'll they visit your game, too

2239
06:21:59,700 --> 06:22:03,540
Mu means mu. Thanks for three dollars. I found you mentioning the tf2 sync of the mile stream

2240
06:22:03,939 --> 06:22:06,180
I was only able to rip the audio. Unfortunately, okay

2241
06:22:10,419 --> 06:22:12,029
Hey guys

2242
06:22:12,029 --> 06:22:14,029
It's me derma 95

2243
06:22:14,349 --> 06:22:16,590
I'm gonna play tf2 on sync of the mile

2244
06:22:17,310 --> 06:22:35,090
coffee to your chicken

2245
06:22:35,090 --> 06:22:36,610
damn, well when you

2246
06:22:36,610 --> 06:22:39,150
When you show that to me, that's

2247
06:22:39,150 --> 06:22:41,819
I guess I did say those are all things that I would have said

2248
06:22:44,669 --> 06:22:45,709
eating

2249
06:22:45,709 --> 06:22:47,709
Incredibly close to the microphone, too

2250
06:22:50,639 --> 06:22:53,599
I must have had a setting wrong. It got my webcam mic

2251
06:22:54,479 --> 06:22:57,520
I guess i'll have to fucking just lie and not do it

2252
06:22:59,200 --> 06:23:01,200
Hey king of acorns. Thanks for five dollars derma

2253
06:23:01,200 --> 06:23:06,479
I was the one guy who recommended you build the gamer birdhouse and still can't believe you actually did it laughing my fucking ass off

2254
06:23:06,720 --> 06:23:10,000
Does that thing get any use or did it get thrown away? I'm so curious. No, that's gone

2255
06:23:10,720 --> 06:23:13,279
That's gone. Nobody wanted that fucking thing

2256
06:23:13,759 --> 06:23:16,319
That was hideous

2257
06:23:20,240 --> 06:23:22,560
I hit it with a hammer fucking recycled it

2258
06:23:26,139 --> 06:23:28,139
Whatever whatever happened to it

2259
06:23:28,860 --> 06:23:31,419
It was sentimental value there

2260
06:23:31,419 --> 06:23:38,209
Remember you should build a sand castle on stream

2261
06:23:38,849 --> 06:23:43,139
That sounds like a really fun idea

2262
06:23:43,139 --> 06:23:44,020
uh

2263
06:23:44,020 --> 06:23:47,150
I live in las vegas

2264
06:23:47,150 --> 06:23:48,909
There's no such thing

2265
06:23:48,909 --> 06:23:51,180
as a beach here

2266
06:23:51,180 --> 06:23:52,299
so

2267
06:23:52,299 --> 06:23:54,299
There's plenty of sand

2268
06:23:54,459 --> 06:24:00,540
But not enough sand to make a sand castle because it's not the right kind of wet sand

2269
06:24:05,069 --> 06:24:12,430
How would I would I build a sand castle in with sand but i'd have to wet the sand and have to I would have to drench

2270
06:24:13,950 --> 06:24:16,900
Five acres with water

2271
06:24:16,900 --> 06:24:18,419
bring water

2272
06:24:18,419 --> 06:24:22,979
Use water dumbass just use water bring a water truck rent a water truck

2273
06:24:23,700 --> 06:24:26,419
Buy beach sand online use a garden hose

2274
06:24:30,299 --> 06:24:32,299
He's landlocked omega low

2275
06:24:37,069 --> 06:24:41,229
Yes, so it was like fucking it's 70 percent of every country on earth

2276
06:24:42,779 --> 06:24:46,060
What do you mean? Oh, he's landlocked omega lull

2277
06:24:48,909 --> 06:24:52,990
Why is that so funny? Oh my god. All right gooberry juice. Thanks for three dollars

2278
06:24:53,389 --> 06:24:55,470
Hey bad advice giver nine eight five

2279
06:24:56,029 --> 06:24:58,189
I got an update for you on my whole bird problem

2280
06:24:58,669 --> 06:25:01,069
And well, uh, my sprinklers broke and wouldn't turn off

2281
06:25:01,549 --> 06:25:05,310
They were on for like 20 minutes and by the time I found out my entire yard was ruined

2282
06:25:06,029 --> 06:25:09,229
Oh, my scarecrow was out there too. He's fucking dead

2283
06:25:09,869 --> 06:25:11,869
More updates coming soon

2284
06:25:12,430 --> 06:25:14,430
What the hell are you doing back here

2285
06:25:23,340 --> 06:25:31,729
What what why are you like the jokey infomercial person that has everything horrible happen to them in black and white when they're trying to

2286
06:25:32,290 --> 06:25:35,330
Put a bird house up or put or make soil in their yard

2287
06:25:35,970 --> 06:25:46,740
It's dead

2288
06:25:46,740 --> 06:25:48,659
Oh, no

2289
06:25:48,659 --> 06:25:50,689
No

2290
06:25:50,689 --> 06:25:57,779
It can't be

2291
06:25:57,779 --> 06:26:10,139
Holy shit. He's dead

2292
06:26:10,139 --> 06:26:12,139
I don't even want to look at that anymore. That's

2293
06:26:13,360 --> 06:26:17,900
Dude's dead

2294
06:26:17,900 --> 06:26:19,979
