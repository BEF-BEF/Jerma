1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:28,120
How's it going? Welcome. Welcome back. He's already telling us to relax.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,130
Yeah, a mod will make it funny in a few minutes. Well then here's the thing.

3
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:41,899
You tell me. I have a question for you. So, a title. The title of this stream.

4
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:48,520
A lot of people will say, okay, so the game we're playing is The Last Hero of Nostalgia.

5
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,359
It's like a comedy parody Dark Souls game. It looks like something I wanted to play for a while.

6
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,520
The problem is, I don't know what's in this game. Right? How do you title something that you don't

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,879
know? I can't make a reference to this game. I don't know what's in it. So how do you title that?

8
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:15,030
We need to wait. We need, we should take a system on this channel of soft titles. Because after

9
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,469
about 30 minutes, you know that some monster is going to show up and everyone's going to give it

10
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:25,349
a name and the title is going to be like Gunu's Revenge. You understand? It's a soft title.

11
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:34,620
Anyways, how you doing? Hope you're doing well. Kind of just play a game today. I can tell you

12
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,370
the plan. Oh, that is, uh, well, I haven't told you yet. So today we're going to play this. Just

13
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:47,980
going to chill out. Play it until it's in. Look, if I don't like it, then I'll play something else.

14
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:54,250
Maybe jump around to a few games. Maybe I really like this. Looks really cool. Looks really

15
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:05,500
interesting. A soft Gunu stream. But so this is, we're doing this tonight. Tomorrow night,

16
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:11,180
tomorrow night, uh, I have a sponsor stream. I haven't seen one of those in a while. It's

17
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:20,699
been a few months and that sponsor stream is going to be to play Wild Hearts. Those of you that have

18
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,780
seen Wild Hearts, it looks like it's pretty fun. It'll be sponsored to play it. I'll be playing

19
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:32,330
tomorrow with Vinny. That's the plan. We don't, we're trying to figure it out. It's possible. It's

20
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:44,759
set in stone kind of, but I will be sponsored to play it. If you don't know what it is,

21
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,979
it's kind of in that. It's like a monster hunter in that monster hunter world, but I believe there's

22
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:57,990
changes. There are some pretty interesting changes to that sort of monster hunting game. Check it

23
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:05,699
out. We'll see. It seems like people think it's good. So I'm really, really interested in really

24
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:23,699
happy to play it. What about Elden Ring? Well, Forster, Forster. Yeah, he hit me up. He's like,

25
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:31,449
Hey, you have an interest to keep going. And I'm like, nah, it was fun, but nah, I feel bad.

26
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:47,189
Why you rude? No, no, we, we had a, look, we were very, very clear about how we felt about

27
00:03:47,189 --> 00:04:05,050
everything, but don't worry. He fucking hated it. I didn't hate it. I've just, I just had to say,

28
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:16,100
you know, the vibes were off and we knew that. Look, I like hanging out with Forster. Okay.

29
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:22,699
It doesn't matter what the game is. We'll do something else. Don't worry. We even started

30
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:29,829
talking about what the new thing could be. Did we, or did I make that up? Just, I don't know,

31
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:43,670
just in case somebody asks them. Oh, I made it up. I made it up. No, no, no, no, no, I didn't. No,

32
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:49,560
I didn't. No, I didn't. Okay. Yeah. Like it was like, Oh, we'll do something else at some point.

33
00:04:51,319 --> 00:05:08,250
Yeah. Yeah. Wait, that's all good. Anyways, you're a liar. Oh, let's go. This is last hero of nostalgia

34
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:17,350
and this could be exciting. Just going to chill out, play a game. You know how it is. Let's go.

35
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:27,529
Last hero of nostalgia. So I don't, I mean, this game is kind of looks like a souls game,

36
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:34,170
but it's not, I think it's like a comedy game. It might be multiple genres. I, I have no idea.

37
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:41,930
But I wonder, is this a controller game? It might be. Yeah. I'm going in without any

38
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,959
knowledge about anything. Okay. Make sure I, okay. I got to get that off the screen.

39
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,279
All right. Brightness to set this low, great hero. You need not see the corpses.

40
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,540
I mean, I have to play games like this. Otherwise I can't see anything. I know that it's intended

41
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,740
for you to play stuff down here, but I'm sorry. I, I, I know that lots of games that do this,

42
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:15,269
it has to be up a little bit. Otherwise I physically can't see. How about like right here

43
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:21,269
is all right. Yeah. Uh, this will help you understand the game a bit and will help you

44
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:26,360
find the fun. Yeah. Why not? Let's do a tutorial. Okay. Good. That's the question. I just,

45
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,389
I just asked that character customization. Please use your keyboard to enter a name.

46
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:54,300
Okay. This is my character. Um, this isn't doing anything. Oh, I think this is the point.

47
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:18,740
It's not doing anything. It's all the way. Uh, max it coward. I just did. How about tattoos,

48
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:29,370
a couple of accessories. Um, I don't know, like here. All right. Every, how everything gets zero

49
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:48,970
besides endowment. All right. That looks good. How about, uh, how about, uh, I'm so bad at making

50
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:58,899
names now. I used to be so good at this, but now I feel like I've, I've diluted the, I've diluted

51
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:04,100
too much. I've, I've made up too many names in my life where now I'm just sitting here going like,

52
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:19,620
I don't know, uh, Fred one. How about, um, no, we have to go. It was a different character,

53
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:42,100
but, uh, slightly, slightly, like slightly sharp, extremely sharp, moderately. Well,

54
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,519
now I'm just naming cheeses. That's like how that's like a cheddar cheese scale. Uh,

55
00:08:51,590 --> 00:09:01,460
minced meat, minced meat, minced meat. Is it minced meat or is it minced meat,

56
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:15,929
minced meat, minced meat. I like it. I think that looks good.

57
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:31,059
Anybody have any complaints? Minced meat glass. All right. This is important.

58
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:46,019
Data din or matter resolutionary sorcerer or random master. I feel like this is like the,

59
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:54,889
the subject line of a company email at a tech company. Like, yeah, don't, please don't say

60
00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:02,759
this stuff. Don't call us this. All right. Hold on. We're just having to wield heavy weapons,

61
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:10,809
favors strength, a noble and stalwart defender of order favors vitality. Champions of fidelity.

62
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:23,000
They are well-rounded and versatile. Okay. Well, dexterity. I can't pick this channel.

63
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,379
Uh, a channel of nostalgia, primal energies favors source, which is magic or a scoundrel who

64
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:35,450
specializes in critical hits, backstabs and Perry's favors luck. I can't play the, I'm not

65
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:41,320
going to play the joke character right now. Should I, I don't know this. I feel like I'm going to get

66
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:56,230
my ass kicked for strength. Just do it. It's a joke game. You're going to be fine. It's a joke

67
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:08,419
game. You're fine. Okay. It's assassin slash rogue. It's not a joke. Oh, I kind of just want

68
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:19,419
a shitload of health. I think I just want a bunch of health. It's boring, but whatever. You are a

69
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:29,980
joke. Shut up. Okay. All right. Fine. I'll try it. I'll try it. I'll try it. I'll try it. So this is

70
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:42,379
like Perry's and backstabs. You're going to get me killed at whatever. All right. Let's go. Yes,

71
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:51,720
indeed. Voice acted. It is called Nostral Gaia where the wait, wait, cut, cut, cut. Was that

72
00:11:51,720 --> 00:12:02,039
your customization screen? Oh, oh, might he save me. I don't know what you are, but you're no hero.

73
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:32,820
So I'm not playing the intro. They'll just get good at pairing. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

74
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:41,139
Be hero became headed dignity. How do I move? It would impale itself on its own appendages

75
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:51,080
and the rid us of its pixelated shame. Okay. So there's a dodge roll actually feels pretty good.

76
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:59,899
Stand in a bar. Anything else I need to know? That's all. Hey, that's it. Just literally give

77
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,820
me a dodge roll with iframes to give me a light and heavy attack and I will beat your game. I

78
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:19,370
promise you no E the welcome host was absent. No one to tell the newest spawn what to do

79
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:35,320
or what it was. E. Okay. Oh, here's the messages on the ground. Yep. Okay. Wait,

80
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:43,929
left bumper is shield. Uh huh. Yep. You are not alone. We have walked before you go back to where

81
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:54,700
you came from. Hero over. Oh, hero lover had become slightly unwelcoming to new heroes

82
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:09,480
and those who assist them. Lock on. Use your heroic icon and heal. Oh, I have three. All right. How

83
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:21,350
does this work layout? Okay. Is there iframes? I think there is. There is. Okay. Cool. Do you

84
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:30,120
get experience? Also three uses to be replenished when you get to the next checkpoint. Okay. Use

85
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:46,570
it carefully. How long does it take? Oh, it takes a little while. If stirrer looks over at this

86
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,960
stream, he's going to think I'm playing modded Eldritch Ring. He's going to be like, what the

87
00:14:51,960 --> 00:15:07,850
fuck is this? Where were these cool mods? Switch stances. Oh, okay. Green herb. You just picked up

88
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:15,240
an item. Check your inventory to see it. Okay. It looks like it is just like a from software game.

89
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:37,769
Toggle item description. The consumable heal. What is all this? The would be hero began to suspect

90
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:49,879
it. Perhaps it was a crit. Okay. How many hits can I take? Dude, modded. Dude, look at these cool

91
00:15:49,879 --> 00:16:01,830
mods, man. Access, access, access. They're probably bosses too. Is there a back? There's a backstab.

92
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:20,600
Otherwise this character would be fucking stupid. Excess place. What does this mean? The confused

93
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,720
stick figure would find no answers in the narrator's library. All right. I'm going to die.

94
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:33,320
The spreading pixelization had twisted everything and everyone into retro. Oh my God. I'm going to die.

95
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:45,580
It's you're supposed to lose during the tutorial. It's like every game that's ever come out. That's

96
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:53,929
in the same genre. You die and you wake up and it's like, it's like, see death is not the end.

97
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,929
And then you go back and I'm going to come back here with like three. Okay. I died. I saw that

98
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:08,599
scripted death. And so the stick figure proved its ineptitude. Okay. Pretty good. So now what

99
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:25,380
happens? Let's see. There we go. Okay. So you're. So I, so I died. All right. I did. I thought it

100
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:33,299
was going to do the thing that they all do. Does everything respawn? Everything does respond. All

101
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:42,039
right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. What about parries? Okay.

102
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:47,640
That is a parry try. Do I dare attempt to try to figure out the parry system in this game? Let's

103
00:17:47,640 --> 00:18:11,690
see. All right. That's not bad. Pretty good. It's actually pretty forgiving. But here's the big

104
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:30,890
question. Can you parry on stairs? It's way better than Elden Ring. Way better. I actually,

105
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:44,339
it does feel fun to play though. I'm interested. Just don't die in the tutorial again. Oh, come on.

106
00:18:49,609 --> 00:19:08,650
Be invincible during this? Yep. Oh, what is that? Reclaim memory. Memory restored. Oh, that's my

107
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:24,380
souls. Why? Whatever. I call it whatever I want. We're good. This is probably secrets and stuff,

108
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:49,299
but whatever. There we go. I like this game. This is a Picross like. Um, I could see where you're

109
00:19:49,299 --> 00:20:05,140
coming from. It's a granny like. Nostalgia's memories had flattened like books without pages.

110
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:14,250
Oh, how the narration wound pixels were the problem. Oh, fuck. Don't be an idiot here.

111
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:30,950
Okay. If I die here, I'm going to be actually pissed off. Oh, yeah. It's a bugle berry like

112
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:41,299
that. That's cool. All right. But wait a minute. What's over here? Is there a sprint? I just

113
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:58,440
accidentally took the last heel. That's very, I'm happy about that. That's great. What is he

114
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:25,000
hitting me with? What's he hitting me with? What was that? All right. We're good. That was really

115
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,170
good play. I made sure to get the parry to get the iframes to get the kill and be invincible.

116
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:38,069
That was not a bad play. That's years of experience right there. And I know for a

117
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:44,119
fact that some of you are going to say true because it is that kind of experience with souls games

118
00:21:44,119 --> 00:22:00,150
is why I just did not die. That's fine. You can troll me all you want, but that's true.

119
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:06,170
Knowing how to perfectly pixel perfect play that was only because of how many times I played souls

120
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:18,380
games. It was this peculiar stick figure. And had it even noticed how retro everything was becoming?

121
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,009
Of course not. It was made out of pixels. It was part of the problem. Oh, everything is like

122
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:44,789
becoming retro. Oh, wait, is this a okay. I'm starting to get it. It's an item back here.

123
00:22:44,789 --> 00:23:05,930
Where was it? You saw it, right? Where was it? Did I am I losing my mind? It was like glowing on

124
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:31,910
a pedestal. What was it? Am I seeing things? No, it is right there. How do I get over there?

125
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:51,130
148 seven momentum special abilities. I mean, this thing is this thing's better. All right.

126
00:23:51,130 --> 00:24:08,579
Yeah. How do I get over there? Illusory books, illusory bookcase. Take that herb. Good call.

127
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:30,490
I don't want to miss the first secret of the game. I don't get it. How do I do it?

128
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:42,339
I don't think there's no jump. Why is there no face cam on? Because I don't feel like having it on.

129
00:24:42,339 --> 00:25:07,369
End of discussion. I don't think I can get in there. I'm going to miss the first secret of the

130
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:14,420
game and everyone's going to make fun of me. Oh, well, I'm going to go through here though.

131
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:57,460
Turn back. Maybe I should. Oh, everything's fine. What is that? Jesus. Fuck. That hurt a lot,

132
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:11,140
guys. That hurt a lot, man. God damn it. Oh, I didn't have enough stamina to swing again.

133
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:28,359
Oh, shit. That's not good. Oh, no. He's still in the tutorial. Oh, shit. He is actually still

134
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:36,410
in the tutorial. He's still in the tutorial. Judging by the four reactions to why there's no

135
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:51,349
face cam, there was gigachad, bald, naked, or pregnant. Okay. No, actually, back a year ago,

136
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:56,059
I never had face cam on. That was a new thing. I would put it on for horror games.

137
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:08,200
It was pretty rare. I kind of like it like this. It'll come on. You're never going to not see my

138
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:16,140
face again. Don't worry. Just like when I want to. And that's it. A year ago? No, no, no, no, no,

139
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:30,470
no, no, no. Not... All right. I mean face cam. Now you're getting me killed. Don't ever show

140
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:45,029
your face again. You're going to come back looking way different. You know, that's actually kind of

141
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:52,140
funny. I'm going to do that. Like, I hope you understand that. This is not some long, elaborate

142
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,380
bit to turn my face cam on in like three months and be like, I don't know, like a fat guy or

143
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,140
something. But you know what I mean? Like, what if I had like a fucking different haircut? I had

144
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:12,009
like different facial hair? I don't know. It might be kind of funny. Oh, stir! Raid from stir. What's

145
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:19,099
going on? Stir. Hope you're having fun in Elden Ring. I am playing a different game that looks

146
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:25,529
kind of like modded Elden Ring, doesn't it? See, I decided that like, oh no, dude, I'm not like into

147
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:30,250
playing like the modded stuff anymore. I'm going to play a video game whose sole purpose is to be

148
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:42,700
a modded Elden Ring. You know, it's like, you know, but you know how it is. Nah, thanks for the raid.

149
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:55,589
Hope you're doing good. Hope all the stir watchers are doing good. All right, this time I'm not going

150
00:28:55,589 --> 00:29:10,039
to mess it up. I have enough health. I'm going to kill this mini boss. That's mean to the devs of

151
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:18,140
this game. What? No, no, no. I mean, this game is very clearly supposed to be a Dark Souls parody.

152
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:28,250
That's the whole point of this game is a Dark Souls parody. It's very good. Hey, when did I say

153
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:35,740
this wasn't fun? In fact, I'm going to tell you right now, of all the souls likes I have played,

154
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:56,569
the parody one seems to have the best first 45 minutes. I'm just saying. Ooh, there's more

155
00:29:56,569 --> 00:30:06,380
over here. Oh, you played like 15 minutes. Yeah. And I'm having fun time. Now the merits of this

156
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,900
game are not solely to be held of it being a parody of Dark Souls. No, that's absolutely accurate.

157
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:18,859
But it's definitely initial intent intent is to get you to say, well, this is kind of like a

158
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:37,500
Dark Souls parody. Doesn't mean that it's all about that. Ooh, that was cool. Was that armor?

159
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:51,819
I don't know what that was. It is. All right, this game is way cooler than I think any of you

160
00:30:51,819 --> 00:31:11,500
thought it was going to be. Is that all I have? Cool. Okay. All right. Well, I got that. Were

161
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:21,460
there any properties on this? Just physical defense. Oh, here's lore pixelating chest piece

162
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,259
with a target painted where the heart would lie. After I was splintered as so often as I was,

163
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:33,700
I would be taken back to the repair shop and restrung for the next encounter. I can't,

164
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:45,140
there's a memory in this thing. I think this is a sprint button, right? It has to be. What is it?

165
00:31:45,140 --> 00:32:11,589
Don't even do it. Oh my goodness. I wonder if you need to break any boxes for any reason.

166
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:19,109
This happened to my buddy, Eric. That's kind of crazy. It seems like Eric's,

167
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:26,630
a lot of stuff's happening to Eric lately. It's kind of weird because it seems like, uh,

168
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:33,579
five to 10,000 of you have this friend of yours named Eric. It seems to do a lot of crazy shit.

169
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,579
That's kind of, all right, I'm not going to fucking lose again.

170
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,910
Don't talk about Eric. You don't even know him. I can't make references to Eric because he's not

171
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:04,619
my friend. Oh, I see. Dude, don't, you don't know Eric. Like why are you talking about him?

172
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:09,579
I know Eric, you don't. Stop bringing him up. You know, all right. That's true. I don't know.

173
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:26,259
I don't know Eric. You do. What? Oh, this is better. Isn't it? Is this better for me?

174
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:46,700
I'm supposed to use daggers. I'm going to stick with that. No, please. Not in the tutorial. Not

175
00:33:47,420 --> 00:34:12,940
again. How do I sprint? We're good. Hold control. Ooh, the spell will consume access when you use it.

176
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:41,800
Access 119 damage and uses access. Oh, I have 20 access. Oh, I get it. Is there a door here?

177
00:34:41,800 --> 00:35:00,199
Let me see a door drop down. Yeah, but I don't want to miss anything. I can go.

178
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:16,199
I don't want to miss anything. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Yep. I get it. I know. Yeah.

179
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,789
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I see. I know. I know. I know. I get you. I get you. I get you.

180
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:53,579
Intentionally frustrating fall joke. All right. Where is it at? Side is it on? Is it over here?

181
00:35:53,579 --> 00:36:08,889
I don't think there's a jump. Memory of an important NPC. How do I get out of here?

182
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:33,909
Can I get out of here? Yes, I can. All right. Let's continue. Let's get out of the tutorial.

183
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:42,570
Weapon upgrades. What's the thing that I do? Oh, oh, this is this game's crunchies.

184
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:56,039
You're going to die to the first boss. I haven't gotten there yet. So just wait. I know a lot of

185
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:01,880
you are. Some of you guys have like a notepad that just has like omega low so bad on it.

186
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,539
So you can just go like control, control, control, control. Just so you can paste it in here. You're

187
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:12,300
ready for it. You have like a whole notepad ready, but I'm not going to die to the first boss.

188
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:35,340
So might as well clear your clipboard. Oh, that's cool. That clear, clear like your clipboard,

189
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,530
just clear your cache and everything. Rape some memory because you're not going to need it.

190
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:57,800
Hold down. Yeah, it doesn't. I think the world is sick and you're like final pixelated.

191
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:05,179
The narrator bowed to save the world. The narrator bowed to cut you from it. Oh,

192
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:16,619
I like the dynamic here. Left stick is sprint is. Oh, I want to make that a toggle. I know it was

193
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:27,190
in the options here somewhere. Toggle sprint. There it is. Oh no, wait a minute. Let's make

194
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:38,139
this even better. Yeah. Okay. Now that's familiar. It takes a lot of stamina. Okay. This is the first

195
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:44,760
boss. Everyone, everyone get your copy and paste ready. Transformed to an impossible adversary.

196
00:38:44,760 --> 00:39:08,170
One written to crush the stick figure on site. Is there a crouch? I don't think I can crouch.

197
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:34,659
Don't give up. We need you. Okay, I got it. Staging room NPCs only. But wait, there's probably an

198
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:47,400
item. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

199
00:39:47,400 --> 00:40:12,389
I don't want to. I went the wrong way. There's a whole nother area over there. Turn already.

200
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:31,420
Why am I ignoring the door? I wanted to come up here because there's an area up here that all of

201
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:56,760
heroes staging room key conduit on fire. Lay your pixels upon it. Bonfire locksmith serrated saw.

202
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:05,559
More access. Be our hero. Well, not yet. I got to go check out that other thing. There's so many

203
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:11,800
weapons already. Okay. What about like the beacon? Do I go fight that? I'm going to go fight that

204
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:37,719
thing in the middle. You're you're in the void. Are you? Oh, don't know what you are or why you're

205
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:53,480
here. Do you want me to guide you? Uh, I don't know. You are no hero and I am no travel brochure.

206
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:59,079
Now I have no idea what your little gestures were meant to convey. Probably rude, but I will tell

207
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:07,909
you what you are. Proof that nostalgia is dying. And what a stick person gesture. Can I level up?

208
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:18,420
Level up. Ah, sometimes you may want to backtrack. Tether to a beacon before you do so. Later,

209
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,139
when you are finished backtracking, you can warp to your tethered beacon. So allow you to pick up

210
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:32,469
where you left off. Okay. So tether here, like tether warp. Like does this count as me tethering

211
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:53,340
here? Or did I just tell it? Where did I just go? Okay. So tether. All right. Level up. What do I do?

212
00:42:53,340 --> 00:43:00,440
Luck. 15 luck gets me a new ability. What should I do? I don't know. Luck. I mean,

213
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:23,059
vitality, stamina. Set your tether first. Okay. This is tethered. Let's go all luck. All in on luck.

214
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:39,179
This is such a bad idea. I want 10 stamina. What about equipment load? Yeah. All right. I'm happy

215
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:58,519
with that. I hope that was a good idea. Wait, I have crunchies too. How much does this do?

216
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:14,630
Luck only. I need 200 more. I should get it from this. What do you think? Last point in luck?

217
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:30,869
Really? It's 1100. Oh my God. We'll just kill something. There we go. Okay. Get all up. I'm

218
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:41,260
going to go kill a thing in the middle. Stamina or health. I'm going to say just get stamina up.

219
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:55,690
All right. Let's go. I'm going to go fight this fucking thing right in the middle. I'm excited.

220
00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:07,820
I didn't mean to press that. Reset. Reset it. What? Why is it over here? Why is it over here?

221
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:23,900
I was not ready for this. There it is. All right. Hope you bet for me. I hoped you bet for me because

222
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:33,210
I beat it. Oh, now all of a sudden everybody's freaking out. Everybody wants to change their

223
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:38,889
bet. Yeah. Sorry. When you can't, if you're at the roulette table and it's spinning and you put it

224
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:52,389
all on black and they say no more bets. Sorry. It's so funny. I looked over and I saw the,

225
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:59,960
that was an immediate change. When it was down to like half, 20% health very quickly,

226
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:10,780
it was like 200,000 points and it jumped to like 3 million in one or two seconds. That's so stupid.

227
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:22,389
All right. First boss is down. It was so fast. That was only a moderately large enemy, dude.

228
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:43,190
All right. Now I want to go back to this thing where the key was. Okay. What the? Um,

229
00:46:43,190 --> 00:47:01,510
a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. Jesus. Too many in here. There are too many in

230
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:28,550
here. Remember to smile while you stab them. Remember to occasionally miss. I like that.

231
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:53,510
So this is where they hang out. Ooh, is it a real door? It is not stable. Wait, huh? There's somebody

232
00:47:53,510 --> 00:48:17,059
behind that door. All right. That's cool. It changes. It's like a, as this, okay. I like that

233
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:41,880
fireplace stone. Ooh, it's a new area, but there's more to look at out here.

234
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:58,630
Why are you playing as a Minecraft sword? I don't know. Why not? All right. So there's a new area

235
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:37,460
that way, but this behind here too, what is over here? Memory is sacred. Receive blessing. No,

236
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:53,190
the hero was rejected. Oh, that's great. I love this walk. This is, I love this. This,

237
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,800
this reminds me of Demon's Souls, the music of what do I do? So I wait for a swing.

238
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:23,989
That hurt a lot. Can I parry it? He's doing the yanky splanky. Did it work? I'm not taking damage,

239
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:37,590
but it's not working. All right. Well, I don't think I can. Oops. This music is great.

240
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:50,659
I tried to dodge it. It didn't work. I'm dodging and it didn't work.

241
00:50:51,380 --> 00:51:16,869
The spirit had a final. Jesus. It's so long. Fuck. All right. I get it. It's not, it's not hard.

242
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:36,039
It's just that here it comes. Boss fights require timing and patience. At first it might seem like

243
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:43,349
there's no safe time to attack, but if you pay attention, a window will open. I think I'm going,

244
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:52,949
we're going Axe. I can't parry it. You just got Luigi. No, I got a tutorial message. There's a

245
00:51:52,949 --> 00:52:11,400
difference. Fuck. It reminds me of the, okay. I pressed it. I pressed dodge. What the hell?

246
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:51,880
There we go. All right. The spirit had a final form. A final form. Oh my God. He went to kick me.

247
00:52:52,440 --> 00:53:25,929
He got way harder. Fuck. Oh, all right. You got to be a little early. Ooh, the crits happen randomly.

248
00:53:26,570 --> 00:54:03,829
I like it. Let's go. This is fun. Wait, that might not be it. Finish him. Huh? Shield of inspiration.

249
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:16,699
You did it. These extra tutorial messages will now stop. The last hero of nostalgia is a mystery.

250
00:54:16,699 --> 00:54:22,599
What are you? What happened to this world? What is expected of you? You won't be handed the answers.

251
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:44,760
Can you uncover them? This game is cool. That music was good too. Yeah. Time to blow up this

252
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:58,889
whole character and ruin it and have to start over in like an hour. You can't go wrong with

253
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:06,010
vitality and stamina until I figure out what I want. I don't know. I'm too scared to do anything.

254
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:25,210
Up strength a little. Let me just hold on. Let me see what I got. Did I get anything new? Attribute

255
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:34,699
bonus. Dexterity 1.1, 2.3, 2, 2.2. So this is the biggest scaling then. Luck influences crits,

256
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:38,809
so that might, that stat might actually be really good. It seemed like it was pretty good.

257
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:58,630
So this is just a better shield. It's bigger. Is there anything else on it? Stability, weight,

258
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:08,920
physical. This is 100% physical damage reduction. Oh, there's no parry anymore. I'm the parry class.

259
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:32,440
Fuck. I don't know what to do. Saw. This thing's pretty good. Ooh, two handed. Pretty good too.

260
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:47,510
Oh, it's a key. All right. I have to make a choice and that choice is to be a coward and just do

261
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:54,309
stamina and health until I figure out what the hell I'm doing. Coward plays, but it's all right.

262
00:56:54,309 --> 00:57:19,900
Yeah, it's always good. It's never a bad idea. Art flow alter. The pixel art and the not pixel

263
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:26,780
art. I like the style of this game. It was undeniable that the scattered bundle of sticks

264
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:35,099
remained pathetic, but something was amiss. The narrator never confused was curious.

265
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:42,469
There's also that other way too. What class am I playing? I'm playing the luck. I forget

266
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:50,650
what this class is named. It's called like random, random class, random master or something. Yeah.

267
00:57:50,650 --> 00:58:08,860
I'm going to go explore that other area. You're fat rolling right now. There is fat rolling. Okay.

268
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:14,900
Well, what is actually doing more damage? I think I'm going to stay with the yeah. I'm going to stay

269
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:33,820
with the ax. I'm so pumped for this playthrough. Yeah. I mean, how long is this game? I'm just

270
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:47,619
going to run. It's about 15. That's cool. I'm just going to play it until I don't really care anymore.

271
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:51,429
Maybe I'll beat it. It seems interesting enough to continue to play.

272
00:58:54,659 --> 00:59:04,360
It's definitely got me. I have been gotten. The game has grabbed my attention for sure. NPC city.

273
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:54,940
Don't even get over here. Oh my God. Stop. Stop. NPC city. Descend quickly is B. Is there a jump?

274
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:21,579
I don't think so. Oh, these are weird. That really hurt. All right. Ladders back there. Blood of

275
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:40,519
nostalgia. Are there bonfires? There are. How mad are you that you guys just voted for a regular

276
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:53,460
ass enemy? Cause wait, no, this is back. Wait, where am I? This is that other room. That hurt a lot.

277
01:00:53,460 --> 01:01:01,750
Okay. It's too bad you didn't vote this time. I actually did try to dodge and it didn't work.

278
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:19,159
I pressed. I, I wouldn't have just sat there. I promise. He dodged into it. You know what I

279
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:26,179
think it is? This game has freeze frame when you get hit. So it's, what's probably happening is

280
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:32,059
because the freeze frame of being hit is overriding your dodge. So there are frames

281
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:37,900
for being hit. Therefore, if it's not perfect, you're going to get that frame from hit damage.

282
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:45,159
Right? Interesting stuff. Cause there is freeze hits, but what did I get from doing that? I mean,

283
01:01:45,159 --> 01:02:05,000
I opened the door, but that really do anything for me today. I learned when you get hit, you can't

284
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,019
dodge. Well, no, I'm just saying like the game has freeze hits. You know what I mean? But I think

285
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:16,489
you know what I mean? Freeze damage. When you get hit, the whole game goes for like one second,

286
01:02:16,489 --> 01:02:39,719
like half a second. So what was down here that I could do? I hate these things already. No,

287
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:51,349
stop. Okay. I'm fine. Yeah. The ladder will take me back up, but what was the point of coming down

288
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:58,070
here in the first place? Just to open up this shortcut. But for what? I guess if you keep

289
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:13,159
dying to the boss, is it just for fun? Check the doors. It looks like I couldn't open any of them.

290
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:21,719
I don't think I can open any of these. I think it's just to teach you that shortcuts exist and

291
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:30,539
that they can be used. Or I mean, maybe this opens later. This right here, like the sewers or

292
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:35,130
something. I don't know. Yeah, it's probably for later. Oh, I'm just going to run. I don't want

293
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:45,110
to fight this thing. I, uh, I ran the way that I should not have run. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

294
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:50,139
wait, wait, wait. Is this different? Wait, what's happening? Where am I? Is this, this is, is this,

295
01:03:50,139 --> 01:04:06,099
no, this is different. Where am I going? This is the beginning of the whole game. All right. I'm

296
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:14,469
running this way. So there really is no purpose to that. And this is just later. Maybe just,

297
01:04:14,469 --> 01:04:20,679
you know, I might just die. I'm imagining like there was a purpose to that opening that,

298
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:45,909
but I guess there is none. I can't run up that. Uh, I'm going to die here. Maybe not. You can do

299
01:04:45,909 --> 01:05:08,980
it. Uh, yeah, it's over here. Did I just seriously run all the way back down? But wait a minute. No.

300
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:16,739
Okay. Yeah. I was like, what the fuck is happening right now? Well, there is no point to that. How

301
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:30,170
come there's no point? It's just like a little Easter egg. Where are we? We made it back here.

302
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:34,980
This is, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Oh, I can't cheese it. I have to fight everything

303
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:44,380
that's aggroed. Oh, that's not good. At least I'll end up right here. What is he on about?

304
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:48,139
I opened up like a door over there and it went down to like the, yeah, you're,

305
01:05:48,139 --> 01:05:59,340
you're here. What do you mean? You're literally watching. I just did it. Okay. It's damn enough.

306
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:17,139
Lost Larry. Quiet. I had my eyes closed because I was scared. Oh, all right. I'm sorry, man.

307
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:26,539
I didn't mean to say that. You got the secrets all over games like this. You have to be prepared

308
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:46,199
for running around in circles. All right. There's a bonfire. Secrets looks climbable. Doesn't it?

309
01:06:51,530 --> 01:07:32,090
Well, is this a, Oh, should I kill him? Not going to kill him. Yeah. All right. Tether.

310
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:46,309
So this is a warp. That's cool. Okay. What does return icon mean? Look up what you have restored

311
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:56,949
by your touch. A hero is known by their actions. Yes. Oh yeah. I know what you are or rather

312
01:07:56,949 --> 01:08:07,690
what you might prove to be. You do not yourself though. Memory of what was is vanishing,

313
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:14,409
but do not despair through your journey. You may yet discover your nature.

314
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:22,409
Your touch upon this beacon has caused a remembering of what was that jagged blade.

315
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:28,729
You scavenged. Can you, can you hear its whisper rummage through your belongings and find it?

316
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:41,420
R1, R1, R1. Okay. Item description. This relic has a pixelating memory.

317
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:47,779
If you can help the relic remember, it will get stronger. The location of its memory could be

318
01:08:47,779 --> 01:08:54,199
anywhere in the world. Relics in the correct location will quiver in your inventory. To find

319
01:08:54,199 --> 01:09:00,840
the location, listen to what it tells you. See how this relic mentions an old man? Try standing

320
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:08,810
beside the old man, selecting this relic and choosing remember. Oh, that's just kind of cool.

321
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:27,420
Spin slash. Holy shit. As you remember different relics, you will gain permanent insight bonuses.

322
01:09:27,979 --> 01:09:33,979
That's highly advantage, a lot of advantage to remembering relics, even if you don't equip them.

323
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:48,920
See your player status screen for your insight bonuses. Okay. But now this is just better. Cool.

324
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:59,479
Feared such depth to be lost forever. You may be whom I've been waiting for.

325
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:09,640
Nostalgia is dying. The great forgetting is taking us all into pixelization and then

326
01:10:11,449 --> 01:10:18,550
oblivion. Heroes, the great ones, most especially were meant to save Nostalgia,

327
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:24,869
but they have forsaken their purpose. They now choke the arteries meant to carry memory back

328
01:10:24,869 --> 01:10:32,470
into our world's heart. I remember their failures, but I shall not lecture you who they were and what

329
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:39,670
they did was to be yours to discover, yours to make meaning from. The first great one wails

330
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:47,510
from within the depths of Nostalgia's memory. Oh, the big bad ones. Oh, you got the gate open for

331
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:57,689
me. Thank you. Oh, no. Why? Oh, you think you're stronger than me. Oh, they always did that. It was

332
01:10:57,689 --> 01:11:03,750
so fun. They would all be like, please stop it. What are you? Oh, so it's a fight you want.

333
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:19,880
You have one item that can be remembered here. Increase. I need to wait. I do. Did I already do

334
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:45,210
it? These moving? I don't think so. Okay. Um, let's just go. Heart of a hero, heart of a hero's touch,

335
01:11:45,210 --> 01:12:00,140
heart of a hero's path. Like starter gear. Oh, 22. This relic's memory yearns to be found.

336
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:05,500
New heroes were once tutorialized that the heart of heroism is not gold and glitter,

337
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:11,340
pomp and celebration, but humility and ultimately sacrifice. They were taught how to give back to

338
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:38,069
nostalgia. So I got to go to the tutorial room, look to its heart. Okay. Heart of a hero. I go

339
01:12:38,069 --> 01:12:48,600
to the tutorial room. He was like, Oh, tutorials are very interesting. Maybe that'll do it.

340
01:12:57,909 --> 01:13:04,329
Memory lingers in an undiscovered location is that's what it would say, right? Undiscovered

341
01:13:04,329 --> 01:13:09,720
region. Undo. Okay. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. Let's go. That's an, I like that mechanic.

342
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:31,239
Remembering ahead. Wait, is this real? People putting those down? All right. That's cool.

343
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:53,859
What the hell is this? Peer down. Do I want to do that? Remember offense. Message box. Yeah,

344
01:13:53,859 --> 01:14:02,279
it is in the game. You, it is styles. Just heart is constricted. Barely any memory goes in or comes

345
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:22,520
out. I got to repair this. No style Gaia. And so at an old man's behest, the stick figure raised

346
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:31,239
its frail limbs to limply push onward. The hero's journey too arduous for its meager pixels would

347
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:41,000
prove a humanist bad guy. How do I do the slash? It's like a spinning slash, right?

348
01:14:44,020 --> 01:15:01,689
Spin slash. How do I do it? Okay. It's, uh, L two. These are a lot of, um, Oh God. All right. The

349
01:15:01,689 --> 01:15:10,939
scale of the game was very small up until five seconds ago. Suddenly lust. I'm not reading all

350
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:38,819
these. So it's pretty good. Soon the walking scribble would understand all that was lost.

351
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:55,430
This is our Dark Souls one. What is it called? That area with, uh, the capper demon undead

352
01:15:55,430 --> 01:16:05,380
burg. Yeah. That's what it reminds me of. Yeah. I'm dumping every point in the luck. I'll be

353
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:15,939
cutting it like a 30 to 40% rate. Why does this actually look fun as hell? Cause it is, it is,

354
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:27,479
it is fun. Luring ahead. Oh, there's only one rating on this. Worship village. You carry one

355
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:47,399
relic that can be remembered ahead. Yep. Oh my God. That's so many people. Oh,

356
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:32,119
cool. That was a lot, um, scarier than it was hard. Get your quest and leave.

357
01:17:33,659 --> 01:18:02,260
Keep moving. What's going on here? Hello. That was a very loud sounding monster. What is that?

358
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:37,460
Okay. Well we got to go in there. Jesus. Okay. Don't fucking die here. Dab on them, dude.

359
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:46,890
I'm working on it. I don't want to, I have funny heels and I don't want to reset the area. So I'm

360
01:18:46,890 --> 01:19:14,020
going to, not going to do that yet. The windows are frowning there. They are a little room. Wait.

361
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:48,869
Oh, wait a minute. Don't go there. Okay. No, out of stamina. Fuck. That's a lot of hurt.

362
01:19:48,869 --> 01:20:06,010
All right. The rolling, uh, the rolling is fine. Unlocked somewhere else. All right. I am not going

363
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:09,609
to remember any of this. So I hope people in chat are paying attention because I'm not going to,

364
01:20:09,609 --> 01:20:23,689
I won't know. Just, I hope there's at least one person here keeping a, a log of every single

365
01:20:23,689 --> 01:20:30,220
place that my character is gone. I know there's somebody in here doing it because I'm just kind

366
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:34,859
of wandering. And it's, that's always a bad thing to do in games like this, but I'm all right.

367
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:50,739
I'm going to turn around after this, dude. Everyone is too high to do that. I don't think

368
01:20:50,739 --> 01:21:14,949
that's accurate. I can do that too. You know, nice. All right. So far so good.

369
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:45,939
Hmm. How did I not hit you? All right. I'm going to turn around. Just one more of these rooms.

370
01:21:47,000 --> 01:22:21,500
Fireplace stone. Yes. Prickly mirror. What was that? Prickly mirror code is a spell.

371
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:35,659
Your stats are too low to use this. Oh, I need whatever that is. Uh, all right. So that's a

372
01:22:35,659 --> 01:23:12,359
spell. Well, cool. You don't matter. Is that elevator? Weird. Okay. I'm not jumping in there.

373
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:37,739
I'm not jumping in there. It's treasure in there. You don't know that. I'll come back later. You

374
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:44,789
loser. I didn't, I didn't do the thing you wanted me to do. All right. I'm coming out here now

375
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:48,470
where I could go the other way. You know what? All right. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta,

376
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:55,380
I gotta, I gotta get out of here. I'm not doing this. I have to go, um, I gotta go this way and

377
01:23:55,380 --> 01:24:03,670
then I gotta go down. I'm going to that bonfire that was out here. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. I got

378
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:29,020
3,500 memory. I haven't even turned this on yet. So is it decks? I wonder if it's decks or just,

379
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:48,939
I already made the decision and it was probably wrong. All right. So I could go over here.

380
01:24:49,979 --> 01:25:02,010
Oh, I can remember here. What can I remember? I don't see anything shaking.

381
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:21,670
No, it'd be in the way. We have to go in here. This is right. Come on. Are we not going in here?

382
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:32,890
It's not even real. Oh, it's a, it's a way for you to die, but they were in the middle of their NPC

383
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:39,000
route and they didn't see me. It's bait for you to get killed by these, but they were all the way

384
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:59,960
at the bottom of their cycle. It's bad. I'm going to die down here. No, I'm dead. All right. So let

385
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:19,319
me, let me try this again. Do a weed pole. No, I don't care. I don't care if you're high or not.

386
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:35,430
High avoid enemy. Oh, I should have read these enemies ahead. No, that's yeah. Hey, look,

387
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:41,189
that's between you and, and you. That's not, I don't have to do with me. I don't need to know

388
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:55,380
that item down here. Why would I avoid these enemies when there's an item at the bottom?

389
01:26:55,460 --> 01:27:27,239
Oh, not it's worth it. Trust me. He hates people that use weed. Oh, it's, I can't do it. And

390
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:40,409
suddenly I can't do it. Oh, nothing here though. I can't go in there. Classic.

391
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:53,159
Well, at least we got to see it. Okay. So I'm going to go up or I don't know,

392
01:27:57,539 --> 01:28:28,409
maybe I'll try to fight that little mini boss. Legend of independence used for weapon upgrades.

393
01:28:28,409 --> 01:28:39,369
Okay. All right. I'm going to go for it. Let's fight this thing and I hope I can do it. Well,

394
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:49,619
try remembering. Oh, thanks for the cheating. Oh, they were full of shit. Okay. Wait,

395
01:28:49,619 --> 01:29:17,399
they mean inside suddenly annoying enemy. Oh, they're lying. Okay. Oh, that hurt. Can we,

396
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:25,369
so somebody's, can we please do an allergy poll? Okay. Yeah. How many people here are allergic

397
01:29:25,369 --> 01:29:31,130
to peanuts? That sounds fun. That's not really fun, but how many people are allergic to peanuts

398
01:29:31,130 --> 01:30:02,260
in chat? Ooh, just an unassuming and insignificant house. I look cool. Are you allergic to peanuts?

399
01:30:05,619 --> 01:30:34,779
Really? Okay. So luck bonuses, critical hits, extra item from pickups, 25% damage for 30 seconds on

400
01:30:34,779 --> 01:30:50,260
attack. What? So this is milestones for luck. Two times memory healing costs nothing. All right.

401
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:58,859
This game's pretty cool. Uh, 95%. Okay. So 5% of the audience here is allergic to peanuts.

402
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:07,300
That's kind of interesting. Uh, all right. I'm going to go up or should I,

403
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:16,420
maybe I'll go this way because there's a way to go. No, I went this way before. I'm going to go

404
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:32,779
here. I'm just going to rest and then go up. What about shellfish? Uh, yeah. How many people here

405
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:46,119
are allergic to shellfish? 5% peanut allergy, Andy's. Why did I say it like that? I was trying

406
01:31:46,119 --> 01:32:09,060
to think of like a way to say that. That was like such a dumb way to say that. Allergy, Andy's.

407
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:23,460
You know, thankfully I am not allergic to anything that I know of. All right. This is strength.

408
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:34,149
Cool looking though. Can't get in here. Well, cause I was trying to figure out like if people

409
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:40,630
that have, I wanted to say people that have peanut allergies, but I said peanut allergies

410
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:45,670
first. So I was like, Oh wow. Like we have a lot of people who are allergic to peanuts,

411
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:51,100
but I said we have peanut. Oh, I already said the first, I already said it.

412
01:32:51,100 --> 01:33:00,579
So how do I fix that mid sentence? 5% again. Damn. Okay. So where's game progress?

413
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:16,199
Nice game progress over here. No, I came from over here. Where is game progress?

414
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:36,619
Up from where I was. Cause that's blocked. Do lactose intolerance. Do lactose intolerance.

415
01:33:43,479 --> 01:33:51,220
All right. All right. All right. Game progress. I wish I could close this door. All right. Wait,

416
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:58,819
wait, wait, wait. You know, I feel like lactose intolerance is going to be pretty high.

417
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:23,460
All right. One more. Are you lactose intolerant? Oh, oh my God. What a disaster. Oh, this is it.

418
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:52,970
Nope. All right. I know where to go. I know where to go. This pole is weird. This is a goofy pole.

419
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:04,840
Is it? I don't think it's that goofy. Nice goofy ass pole. All right. I'm not going to aggro the

420
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:13,140
entire instance. I'm going to sit down again. These, you got to dodge. Okay. These things are

421
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:20,810
hard because dodging back doesn't help. I got to dodge right. And then you get put lined up. No,

422
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:29,369
how do I, that's a shitload of people that have lacked homelands. 25%. 26% is lactose intolerant.

423
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:34,569
I just lost those souls, but this is an incredibly eye-opening experience to see this.

424
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:51,479
25% said lactose intolerant. Jesus. That's a lot. I actually, I haven't had that much

425
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:56,439
milk. And you know, I'm full of shit and I know I'm full of shit. So I can tell you that before

426
01:35:56,439 --> 01:36:01,640
we talk about this, but I'm one of the, well, let's be real. I'm going to be honest. So I'm

427
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:06,279
one of those people that says, I don't take in that much dairy. Like, no, I don't take in that

428
01:36:06,279 --> 01:36:11,399
much dairy anymore. You know, I, I, oat milk, I drink oat milk and I put oat milk in my coffee.

429
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:16,439
I still eat a shitload of cheese. I still eat a ton of fucking ice cream. I'm full of shit.

430
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:26,439
Right. And it sucks. And I, cause I really do want, you know, I, I try to get you,

431
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:31,800
and I don't want to, I want to, I am eating, I'm trying to eat better, you know, trying to

432
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:38,789
get cut out dairy, dairy is just, I don't know, it feels like bad for my skin and, but how do you,

433
01:36:38,789 --> 01:36:44,069
how do you replace cheese? Like how? And I've tried the cheese alternatives and they are not good.

434
01:36:44,789 --> 01:36:58,819
They are not good. Let's be real. I've tried a bunch of them, a sharp cheddar cheese,

435
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:05,689
Oh my God. Like I, you, I don't, it can never be replaced. If they figure it out, I'm willing to

436
01:37:05,689 --> 01:37:12,090
try. I am. I'm very willing to try it, but like an extremely sharp cheddar cheese. Oh, no, I,

437
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:30,550
it's can't, it's, it's irreplaceable. I'd like to play the game now. Okay. Cheese is addictive.

438
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:46,260
Yeah. I mean, I could, I could see that. It just tastes so good, but milk, I don't know.

439
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:51,340
If there's one thing that I can tell you that I have absolutely completely cut out of my entire

440
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:59,579
diet, it's just, it's regular milk. It's just, no, no thanks. Something about it now, even like

441
01:37:59,579 --> 01:38:14,659
kind of grosses me out. Like I still eat meat and everything. Like, I don't know. Just eat what you

442
01:38:14,659 --> 01:38:19,140
like. I'm just trying to be conscious of just, you know, just be conscious and all things in

443
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:24,810
moderation. Ben Frank, Ben Franklin was the smartest fucking person to ever live. I've said that a

444
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:30,090
thousand times on this stream and Franklin smartest man ever. So listen to Ben Franklin, all things

445
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:34,649
in moderation. Don't eat steak every day and have it, have it when you feel like it. You don't have

446
01:38:34,649 --> 01:38:39,449
to eat it every single day. Don't chug milk every day. You, Ben Franklin wouldn't have done that.

447
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:50,180
Item ahead. Watch me like Ben Franklin was like a huge proponent of drinking milk every day.

448
01:38:53,539 --> 01:38:59,689
All things in moderation, except of course for milk. All Americans should be drinking at least

449
01:38:59,689 --> 01:39:06,090
two gallons of milk a day. And those of you that disagree off, I'm dead. I got to pay attention.

450
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:20,579
No, I'm not going to read that because I disagree. Ben Franklin is no, I refuse to say it because I

451
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:26,359
don't believe you. I don't believe it. I refuse to say it. No, I'm not even going to manifest that.

452
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:33,380
No, I'm not going to even manifest it because no, I've refused to give that. I'm not going to even

453
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:42,869
say that. I will say it. Okay, fine. All right. Ben Franklin is not in hell. The person that said

454
01:39:42,869 --> 01:39:47,750
that time them up for five minutes. You said Ben Franklin's in hell and no, I'm sorry. I don't

455
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:52,409
believe you. Why is Ben Franklin? No, I said it out loud. Now I don't know what to do.

456
01:39:54,439 --> 01:40:01,159
No, that's not real. Nope. Ben Franklin's not in hell. I have 1500 souls on the ground

457
01:40:01,159 --> 01:40:14,310
and you've lost them. You lost him. I didn't. Benjamin Franklin had a milk punch. He was a

458
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:24,310
milk punch aficionado. It serves 12 people, six cups of brandy, 11 lemons, two cups lemon juice,

459
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:30,470
four cups water, three fourths cups sugar, one whole nutmeg, plus extra nutmeg for garnish,

460
01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:36,310
three cups whole milk, one remove peel from all 11 lemons with a vegetable peeler, taking care

461
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:46,310
to remove only the yellow part. So he like, all right, but he probably, all right, but he probably

462
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:53,189
only drank like two glasses of that. He got to the end of one. He was like, ah, that was delicious.

463
01:40:53,989 --> 01:41:00,869
I guess I'll have another delicious milk punch. Okay. Ah, that's another milk punch down.

464
01:41:00,869 --> 01:41:05,430
I've had enough. All things in moderation. And he just dumped the rest down the sink or something.

465
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:10,489
You know what I mean? Or he like, he like gave it to other people. He like gave it to like a bunch

466
01:41:10,489 --> 01:41:20,710
of other people. He didn't drink at all. All things in moderation. He's in hell. He's in hell.

467
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:25,430
So it's no, I got to play this game. I got to play this game.

468
01:41:36,420 --> 01:42:14,310
He's in hell. Okay. I need to fucking relax. I need to pull if he's in hell or not.

469
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:19,430
Fine. The last poll you're going to get the whole night is Ben Franklin in hell.

470
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:40,680
Yes or no. 11 lemons and two cups of lemon juice. What? Yeah. What a weird fucking recipe.

471
01:42:40,760 --> 01:43:01,050
I do not. I do. I would say, do not drink that. Why did we get here? We were just asking if you

472
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:06,090
had a peanut allergy. Now, now we need to, now we're talking about Ben Franklin in hell.

473
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:12,460
No. All right. So 5% of you have a peanut allergy. That's interesting stuff. That's

474
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:19,369
interesting stuff. All right. Some of you got peanut allergy, which I wonder what I've always

475
01:43:19,369 --> 01:43:29,130
wondered what that was potentially like. All right. This is weirdly like out of place.

476
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:49,640
I'm slow. Oh, it's a poison. Okay. Yes. What the fuck? Okay. Yeah. Ben Franklin is definitely at

477
01:43:49,640 --> 01:44:06,260
least in purgatory. I love how somebody just said it has been ruled. What? Why we don't get to decide

478
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:29,670
that? What do you mean it has been ruled? Democracy, just democracy manifests. Can't believe it.

479
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:46,890
Nice crit. It's what Ben Franklin would have wanted. Ben Franklin could be sitting on like a cloud

480
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:53,109
somewhere and like God just kind of knocks on the door. Hey, Ben, don't want to interrupt or

481
01:44:53,109 --> 01:44:58,149
anything, but there seems to be a poll going on in this weird fucking weirdos channel.

482
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:03,930
German nine, eight, five, but probably you'd never heard of them before. But, um, so they're voting

483
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:08,520
to determine whether you go to hell or whether you're in hell or not. And kind of have to,

484
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:24,300
I mean, you know, democracy manifests, right? God watches German. No, whatever. Nice family guy bit.

485
01:45:24,939 --> 01:45:31,579
Hey, other, other pieces of media can reference God talking to people in purgatory. Okay. It's not

486
01:45:31,579 --> 01:45:37,770
his family guy, although that is a, that would happen on family guy. It'd be like, God, if you're

487
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:44,500
like, Hey, excuse me, Benjamin Franklin, whatever. Like, you don't act like you didn't laugh at a

488
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:48,869
family guy joke before. Don't act like you never laughed at family guy. You're full of fucking,

489
01:45:48,869 --> 01:45:53,670
you're full of baloney. You're full of baloney. I know you're full of baloney. You have laughed at

490
01:45:53,670 --> 01:46:02,390
a family guy joke before. You're full of baloney. And yes, ironic Peter Griffin memes count. Ironic

491
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:29,800
Peter Griffin memes count. You're full of baloney. Okay. So where do I go? Great one. Family guy has

492
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:40,250
good jokes, but a lot of bad ones. Sure. But you still laughed at it at time. And you just,

493
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:48,710
you can't stand it. He was sitting there on the couch and it was like, Oh Lois, remember the time

494
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:55,020
that I met Ben Franklin in hell and it played out. And you went and covered your mouth. I'm like,

495
01:46:55,020 --> 01:47:14,359
fuck. No, no. Um, okay. Let me, what's the, all right. Time to do what I do and not pay attention

496
01:47:14,359 --> 01:47:32,539
for like half an hour. Interesting. Armor ahead. Should I just delete these? I always had these

497
01:47:32,539 --> 01:47:49,130
off during from software games because I feel like it's kind of cheating. All right. This guy's scary.

498
01:47:51,750 --> 01:48:00,649
That hurts so much. Oh my God. Where is this? Where is this? I don't remember. I got hit and

499
01:48:00,649 --> 01:48:17,979
I got killed in three hits. I'm going to run. I'm going to try to remember where that was

500
01:48:17,979 --> 01:49:00,260
as best as I can. Yep. Okay. Then it was this way and then in here. All right. Do not follow me.

501
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:29,619
Open the gate. I will after this. Why is it on his head? Wow. No, we're not doing no more

502
01:49:29,619 --> 01:49:36,199
pull. We're not doing any more pulls. Master chef, fireplace stone. Oh yeah. I just got a whole

503
01:49:36,199 --> 01:50:04,090
new set of gear. Cuts and scrapes. This thing's probably heavy. This thing is very heavy. Yeah.

504
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:22,859
I'm overburdened right now. I think this is good gear for now. Anything else? Anything pulsing?

505
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:38,229
He hates us. I don't. I just healed because he said that. Memory of an important NPC. Watch

506
01:50:38,229 --> 01:50:53,270
out for the NPC. What had its story been? What telling had spawned it? Well, I definitely don't

507
01:50:53,270 --> 01:51:13,560
want to do that right now. Nostalgia did not want it. I just got a new weapon. 93 plus 67.

508
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:31,369
This thing's better. Higher crit too. I'm going to put the buckler on because I want to be able

509
01:51:31,369 --> 01:51:52,310
to parry. Well, I'm not doing that right now. I just made a quiche with half and half. You know

510
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:59,060
what's funny about quiches? I feel like I've never seen anyone make a quiche. They just sort of appear

511
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:04,310
randomly during the year at random holidays. I've never seen somebody make one. It's just like, oh,

512
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:12,149
there's a quiche on this table. I've never seen anyone make it. It's like, oh, it's a quiche. Oh,

513
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:26,409
okay. All right. All right. Cool. Quiche is gross. I disagree. I think default quiche is not great.

514
01:52:26,409 --> 01:52:40,420
Yeah, bacon. Ham quiche is really good. Ham and cheese quiche.

515
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,630
Broccoli too. Oh yeah, that's good.

516
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:15,850
Oops. Wow. He didn't even need the bench. This is him just completely asserting how strong

517
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:53,989
of a character he really is. Okay. 20 luck. I have multiple crunchies. What do you think?

518
01:53:55,369 --> 01:54:04,550
Dexterity? If I'm going to be using quick fast daggers, it has to be dexterity. Dexterity, luck

519
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:22,859
or vitality. Luck only? No, let's do health. All right. Now I'm going to go fight over the

520
01:54:22,859 --> 01:54:53,960
hell that thing is. Okay. And then it was this way, right? And then, uh, uh, uh, uh, found it.

521
01:54:53,960 --> 01:55:42,810
Well, that's absolutely a boss. Are we knocking? Hey, wing. Oh my God. What?

522
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:06,359
He almost just killed me. A hero did come, but not the one you wanted.

523
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:36,119
Is there, be you a hero, my beloved. One's in the chat if you know what that is. Friend ahead.

524
01:56:36,119 --> 01:56:45,239
Okay. No, no, no. I, I cannot let you in. I, I love everything. My stars. We cannot risk it.

525
01:56:46,039 --> 01:56:54,970
No, no, no. Yes. Should you come upon something with which I could restrain myself in your

526
01:56:54,970 --> 01:57:03,369
presence, uh, uh, a manacle or a shack of some fidelity. Bring it to me so I shan't

527
01:57:05,289 --> 01:57:14,739
unduly. Then I would open my door and serve you. What? No, no, no. Bring then.

528
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:45,850
How about I just put a fucking land mine right here? How would you do that? I don't know. Ooh,

529
01:57:45,850 --> 01:58:05,109
the Smith's hammer. Such waste. What did you find? Are you a hero? I'm an apprentice Smith.

530
01:58:05,109 --> 01:58:10,949
Oh, I was meant to be. I've sought some memory of Nostalgaia's craft in tradition, but

531
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:18,659
all I've found is forgotten with no masters to teach me. I'll never become a Smith,

532
01:58:21,109 --> 01:58:27,829
but you could work on my gear. That ain't no crude tool friend. It's the Smith's hammer,

533
01:58:27,829 --> 01:58:33,909
the instrument of Nostalgaia's greatest crafts folk. Any apprentice would know it,

534
01:58:33,909 --> 01:58:40,710
even in its current state. A shame it don't remember itself, but that ain't no crude tool.

535
01:58:46,069 --> 01:59:07,699
It can remember. Remember overhead smash, increased damage to armored. Can you use this now?

536
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:28,840
Jesus. How? What did you do? I ain't worthy. I'll do my utmost to honor and

537
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:37,159
carry forth our traditions. The hammer has bound itself to me or bound me to it.

538
01:59:37,159 --> 01:59:46,539
My skills are meager. Should you find a workable anvil, you can use this relic to summon me.

539
01:59:46,539 --> 01:59:57,029
I'll improve your arms best I can. The Smith's hammer is the greatest

540
01:59:57,029 --> 02:00:03,430
relic of Nostalgaia's crafts folk, transcending all who swing it. It's the primordial repository

541
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:11,319
of our art. Such legacy. Of course it still clings to some memory. Throughout the cycles,

542
02:00:11,319 --> 02:00:16,199
each of Nostalgaia's masters wielded the hammer to enhance relics for our heroes.

543
02:00:16,199 --> 02:00:19,560
I've always longed to be a smith, to be a part of that.

544
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:30,979
Miners in the cliffs above Orsha, once excavated and readied great repositories of all.

545
02:00:30,979 --> 02:00:35,060
Lore. Should you find an anvil there, with enough fidelity for my craft,

546
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:38,739
limited as my skills may be, might even find a lingering master there.

547
02:00:38,739 --> 02:00:44,819
Ain't much likely, but a little hope is something. Miners in Shulim might aim us.

548
02:00:44,899 --> 02:00:46,739
Wait, it's the same, hold on.

549
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:58,069
It's the same, right? Miners in Shulim might aim us.

550
02:00:58,069 --> 02:01:03,939
Oh no, the chuckle is at the end. It's part of the last. Oh, it's different. It is different.

551
02:01:03,939 --> 02:01:39,500
Okay, well, sliver of tradition. You can do it. Try love. All right, try patience.

552
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:56,260
How about you stop? All right, this thing's gonna move, right? We all know it.

553
02:01:56,819 --> 02:02:10,890
Consider remembering. Meet. Fully heal health and cure all status ailments.

554
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:31,619
This thing is shaking. Remember. Ooh. Wait, we have lore. I'm gonna read it. Okay.

555
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:37,220
The NPC anti-heroes built barbaric pits where they fought one another to the death.

556
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:43,220
Their aspiration was to rise above the heroes they'd grown to hate. To strip away the weakness

557
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:48,819
which had kept them subservient, and save the world themselves. They called their champions

558
02:02:48,819 --> 02:02:55,720
potheads due to their distinct armor. The anti-hero Brendan Merkel was the only known NPC to

559
02:02:55,720 --> 02:03:01,220
single-handedly slay heroes. Unlike the other potheads, he donned the armor of his victims.

560
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:12,149
I could still feel my hero's blood congealing in me while Brendan Merkel slipped me on. Jesus.

561
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:21,079
Whoa! Whoa! Look, look, look, look, look! Look it! I'm like a person! What? Holy shit! That's a-

562
02:03:21,079 --> 02:03:43,319
Okay, that was actually a pretty cool reveal. What? He's a real boy! Very cool. All right. Yeah!

563
02:03:43,319 --> 02:03:52,380
All right, let's go. It's a full set bonus. You actually look normal. That's pretty cool. I'm

564
02:03:52,380 --> 02:04:17,909
not gonna lie. Take the armor off. Let's find out. Yeah, so if I take a piece off. Ah. Yeah,

565
02:04:17,909 --> 02:04:25,270
it's all kind of pixely. When you complete it, it turns into like a 3D game. See how these are kind

566
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:35,930
of low fidelity? This whole outfit was low fidelity until I completed it. It's a metaphor. Cool.

567
02:04:55,180 --> 02:05:04,739
I gotta remember so then the world can look like a 3D game. Not gonna lie, that's kind of freaking

568
02:05:04,739 --> 02:05:26,119
pog. I don't have any heals. Oh, fuck you. I gotta make it count right now. God damn it.

569
02:05:26,119 --> 02:05:41,670
That's all right. It's all right. Shit. Mind your tongue, one who lacks peanut allergy.

570
02:05:50,060 --> 02:06:01,529
Why did you say it like that? That's just a weird way to say that. Mind your tongue. All right,

571
02:06:01,529 --> 02:06:40,300
let's get back over there. That was kind of a long ways away. Don't freak out. I gotta get better at

572
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:47,079
that because that this whole class is about parrying and backstabs and crits and I gotta be

573
02:06:47,079 --> 02:07:16,970
better at that. That's how I'm gonna get any kills at all. Okay, go on, do it. Do it. You're only

574
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:55,239
behind here. Got it. You can do well too. It's good to know. Gesture trust. Load and die. Oh,

575
02:07:55,239 --> 02:08:29,319
all right, something bad down here. Blue jerry wall. Somebody's behind me. Right behind. Just

576
02:08:29,319 --> 02:08:58,020
use the Zweander. I think that's it. What's going on? Oh, they were all following me from before,

577
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:43,270
I guess. Clean. Barnacles. This guy is good. These unstable pixel doors. I wonder what that

578
02:09:43,270 --> 02:10:23,989
means. Legend of Independence. Ugly thing. What? Who rated that good? Ugly thing. What was that?

579
02:10:23,989 --> 02:10:39,510
That was very weird. Okay, I'm very far right now. I do not want to die. I'm going to play like a

580
02:10:39,510 --> 02:11:23,909
coward. I'm written. Betray. Trade? Are these scripted messages? I, no, I don't think so. NPC?

581
02:11:35,989 --> 02:11:36,710
Is this bait?

582
02:11:56,970 --> 02:12:24,149
Was that a bad idea? I don't know. I don't know. I've never played this before. Ugly thing. No.

583
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:45,689
I'm going to say, um, a bunch of swears. Oh, okay. How about, um, consider, consider, uh,

584
02:12:46,569 --> 02:13:33,300
consider a concept. Tiny, tiny cardboard box. This is aggro range. Forgotten knight armor.

585
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:57,189
This relic's memory has been forgotten. So I can't do anything about that. Maybe some things you

586
02:13:57,189 --> 02:14:05,270
just can't do. They have no memory. Here's the, all right, I gotta remember this. This is the

587
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:54,600
shortcut. That was cute. Making sure. Oh fuck. Okay. Parry, parry, parry, parry, parry. I'm

588
02:14:54,600 --> 02:15:53,539
going to die in one fucking hit. Jesus. I have a lot of souls. Okay. Oh, nope. What? Oh, it's

589
02:15:53,539 --> 02:16:08,579
kind of slowed. All right. This looks like progress. Do I want to drop down here though?

590
02:16:08,579 --> 02:16:15,750
I guess over that way. Whatever. I'm going for it. Have I not been, how did I not get this?

591
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:39,540
Caliber of memory. Shit. Flow state entered. I wonder what that means. More damage or something.

592
02:16:39,540 --> 02:17:14,379
Okay. This guy's wearing pots and pans. I'm dead. God damn it. I got killed by the guy with a

593
02:17:14,379 --> 02:17:27,459
fucking pot on his head. I was so, all right. That's 6,000 souls. I don't want to lose that.

594
02:17:27,459 --> 02:17:45,819
Okay. I opened up a new place. There was a new place I opened. I think it's up here. Why was it?

595
02:17:45,819 --> 02:17:56,979
And then I don't really remember. I'm probably going the long way, but

596
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:40,250
it's all right. I did not go in these. Oh, big mistake. Get it. Did I get it? Nope. All right.

597
02:18:40,250 --> 02:19:14,940
That's better. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All

598
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:28,440
right. The door was, I don't remember. Oh, wait. It's this guy. I got to get better at parrying.

599
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:42,280
Truly fucking awful at this game. The parrying aspect of it. All right. This is the Smith and

600
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:58,010
then it was up and around because I opened the door up here. Right. No, did I? I'm in the right

601
02:19:58,010 --> 02:20:39,450
vicinity. I know that. We'll get your souls. Yeah. I'm, I'm making my way over there. Okay.

602
02:20:39,450 --> 02:20:48,860
Almost there. This was a huge backtrack and I'm really not happy about it at all. But I'm

603
02:20:48,860 --> 02:21:14,280
almost there. There's definitely a door. I could have just gone in, but whatever. All right. Here

604
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:29,219
we are. Good, good, good, good, good, good. Let's go. I went in here. I went across and then the

605
02:21:29,219 --> 02:21:52,549
guy with the pot in his head killed me. Okay. Don't screw this up. Where, where, where was it?

606
02:21:52,549 --> 02:22:07,510
Shit. I'm confused. No. Was it through here? I'm in the right vicinity. I just don't know

607
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:30,549
exactly where I need to go. Was it actually across the bridge? I think this is accurate. Yep. Okay.

608
02:22:30,549 --> 02:23:40,600
Good. All right. Round two. Let's go. Antihero pothead. This relic is part of a set. Okay. So

609
02:23:40,600 --> 02:24:00,889
this is part of a set. 7.8, 1.6. Am I fat rolling? Cause it looks kind of funny. Wait a minute.

610
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:25,860
Aha. I knew I, wait, that's not even the shovel. Wait, it costs money to do some of these. Do it.

611
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:52,180
I mean, I guess it just does scale with dexterity. I'll do it. First damage to evil. Let's try it.

612
02:24:52,180 --> 02:25:15,620
Uh, 66 or 63. Ooh, that's not good at all. 93 plus 67 versus 60 say this is way worse. I try it.

613
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:28,120
It's a really good scaling weapon. Yeah. If I had more decks, maybe it'd be cool, but nope.

614
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:46,860
Still cool though. Yeah. Good range. What the fuck is that? Uh, okay.

615
02:26:15,159 --> 02:26:23,159
You've been left to figure things out for yourself and that's terrible. So let me help.

616
02:26:23,799 --> 02:26:30,520
Nostal guy was a gauntlet where heroes, I want to R one so bad for a bit, unfortunately,

617
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:36,760
and then sacrifice themselves back to the world's heart so that new stories could begin.

618
02:26:37,399 --> 02:26:45,719
These new stories were inspired by what came before. They built on the beauty of the past,

619
02:26:45,719 --> 02:26:51,799
but heroes quit letting go. They grew obsessed with maintaining their dominance,

620
02:26:51,799 --> 02:26:59,000
live in their own legacies. And without new inspiration, Nostal Gaia is being forgotten.

621
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:05,159
Anywho, if selfish heroes won't give themselves back willingly, a real hero will have to make

622
02:27:05,159 --> 02:27:21,239
them let go. Then Nostal Gaia's heart will open again. The first great one chokes Nostal Gaia from

623
02:27:21,239 --> 02:27:57,059
the depths. Oh, no, he likes it. The first great one chokes Nostal. All you gotta do is kill it.

624
02:27:57,139 --> 02:28:04,620
I can't believe that must have been really hard. Oh, it hurts. Oh, yeah, it hurts. Oh,

625
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:24,340
fuck you. Oh my God. All right, I'm leaving. I can take it. I can take it.

626
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:32,620
I'm going to leave now. I'm going to leave now. The lanky bundle wobbled and climbed,

627
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:45,959
ever eager to reach some height unsuited to it. I thought I could kill it. Gold shortage,

628
02:28:45,959 --> 02:29:06,569
hunters wanted. OK, I got a lot of stuff. Wait, I can bring that back to that guy. Oh, it's

629
02:29:06,569 --> 02:29:30,010
happiness. I can't. OK, this is important. What do I level up here? Decks, probably right.

630
02:29:30,010 --> 02:29:35,020
Oh, new luck ability. Decks and luck. And there's an anvil.

631
02:30:04,579 --> 02:30:08,100
The sake of you and yours. But some materials were used for meaningful things,

632
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:12,899
like improving our hero's arms. Took pride in our work back then.

633
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:20,899
No sign of a master smith. Well, I have some crude skills. I'll aid you. Best I can, hero.

634
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:31,129
OK, hone weapons. Uh, sliver of tradition. Oh, shit, I have to actually think about this.

635
02:30:31,930 --> 02:30:45,100
It's probably this one, right? I feel like it's that one. The voice acting is legit good.

636
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:56,329
It is. What about infuse? So I can infuse the this with the legend of independence,

637
02:30:57,219 --> 02:31:15,049
independent edge of entropy 214. That's better. But I'm going to go for this. I feel like this

638
02:31:15,049 --> 02:31:25,879
thing's pretty good. It makes it pure with no scaling. Um, this is just way better. So I'm

639
02:31:25,879 --> 02:31:29,159
going to stick with this. I mean, this is the other one that probably is pretty good, but

640
02:31:29,719 --> 02:31:44,069
I'm going to go with this. OK, I need three of those to get it higher. Do the halberd too.

641
02:31:44,069 --> 02:31:47,579
Eventually, this might be really good with the scaling. I'm going to hold on for now.

642
02:31:48,219 --> 02:31:53,239
If you find another anvil, especially with a master smith, remember to summon me there, too.

643
02:31:53,799 --> 02:32:15,430
OK. Uh, yeah. All right. 15 decks, I think is good. I'll stop there. We'll get vitality

644
02:32:15,430 --> 02:32:28,200
stamina to 15 and then luck to 25. Go do the shackle quest. All right. Can I teleport tether

645
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:44,500
warp? I mean, this is going to bring me. I definitely want to keep it here. All right.

646
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:49,139
Time for me to work backwards. Good luck, because I don't have I don't remember anything that just

647
02:32:49,139 --> 02:33:06,969
happened. I remember going this way. I know I don't. All right. I'm going to go check out

648
02:33:06,969 --> 02:33:16,540
that NPC. What is it? Can I open that? OK, this is locked. It's like glitched out. Yeah, I remember

649
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:36,549
this. Oh, I can take it. Oh, yeah. OK. Uh, drop down. All right. Where was that guy over there?

650
02:33:48,299 --> 02:34:14,950
That's doing 533 damage. OK, we got to go across. I don't know. Is it going to kill me? All right.

651
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:28,899
Where this guy's right here somewhere, right? All right. Are you ready? I don't know if I want

652
02:34:28,899 --> 02:35:02,500
this person to hang out with me. OK. My hero. Get like traps in here or something. I'm going

653
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:15,860
to get killed or something. Welcome to my shop. It's a shopkeeper. I have long longed for you,

654
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:25,860
my radiance. We all did once. I wish you could experience the parades and feasts we held in your

655
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:33,700
honor. Banner maidens and clamoring children all thronging the streets to glimpse our salvation,

656
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:41,219
our markets overflowing with the bounty each hero's deeds had brought us. That was enough,

657
02:35:41,219 --> 02:35:48,020
but we have forgotten. I must never read them myself in your presence, my everything.

658
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:56,180
For should the great forgetting take me, I could not bear that these pixels I was should turn

659
02:35:56,180 --> 02:36:13,479
ravenous upon you. Oh, what is this shit? You could be a caster. That's right. That's cool.

660
02:36:13,479 --> 02:36:28,500
Should I buy any? Vibrating sword. This thing's kind of cool looking. Deck scaling. Noble E.

661
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:48,569
Pien. Is this a spell? No, this is no, it is a spell. I kind of want this. Not that expensive

662
02:36:48,569 --> 02:37:01,750
either. Hold on. I'm gonna get it. Wilk, I would make you such but never must I make such an ease

663
02:37:01,750 --> 02:37:13,940
of it. Therefore, tis for memory for meaning. Okay, I want it. Let me have it. Oh, one of these

664
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:24,250
too. Torch. I get that. Maybe I should get the torch. This thing's ready to get. Oh, this it's

665
02:37:24,250 --> 02:37:56,709
in here. Thousand. All right, hold on. Let's go for it. Remember, thousand. Crit damage up in offhand.

666
02:37:56,709 --> 02:38:33,370
Wait, by how much? Do welding. I'll rock this for a little while. The rest of this stuff I'll have

667
02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:38,420
to come back for. I don't really know what it's I know what this is for. But maybe I should get the

668
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:43,110
torch. I'm probably going to be pissed if I don't buy this. You know, in an hour, I'm going to be

669
02:38:43,110 --> 02:39:01,450
like I was right there. I had an opportunity and I didn't do it. Is this thing vibrate? Okay, that

670
02:39:01,450 --> 02:39:07,239
was cool. It was worth coming back here for. I could upgrade this too. All right, I'm going to

671
02:39:07,239 --> 02:39:26,600
upgrade this. Hold on. I feel like I could just die and just wake up at that bonfire. Let me test

672
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:37,379
it out. All right, I actually like it. This is way, way cooler than what I was doing before.

673
02:39:37,379 --> 02:39:50,790
All right. What's the fat? The fastest way is probably just to go backwards,

674
02:39:54,120 --> 02:40:19,059
right? And just teleport to the bonfire. It's like right here. It's like over here, right? I don't

675
02:40:19,059 --> 02:40:34,899
remember. No, it's not. It's back. Um, just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. If there's more

676
02:40:34,899 --> 02:40:49,510
than two layers to a level, I will forget where I am every time. If your game has three layers,

677
02:40:49,510 --> 02:40:53,989
one of them is always not in is always gone. It could be the middle layer. It could be the top

678
02:40:53,989 --> 02:40:59,590
layer. It could be the bottom layer. One of them is gone. No matter what, it always happens to me.

679
02:40:59,590 --> 02:41:05,450
All right, let me upgrade this. If the Smith's hammer choosing me,

680
02:41:05,450 --> 02:41:18,469
ain't assigned them. Ooh, yeah. Hopefully this wasn't a bad decision, especially with the master

681
02:41:18,469 --> 02:41:43,719
Smith. All right, let's go check over here. Now, is there a jump? Uh, but hold on. Is that bad?

682
02:41:43,719 --> 02:42:26,420
Yeah, it's bad. Why are you using rivers of blood? Because it's good. How come you don't do the

683
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:40,309
ooh, ooh anymore? Because I, we might have to have another kill the meme stream. I'm telling you.

684
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:48,280
Do you remember that? I keep seeing a lot of similar memes show up and you know,

685
02:42:48,280 --> 02:43:00,100
it's time to kill the fucking meme. I think we've got to do another one.

686
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:07,049
80% of everybody here does not remember that. Yeah, I mean, I'm starting to see some of the same

687
02:43:07,129 --> 02:43:24,840
jokes, right? It might be time. It might be time. And I, I'm at fault of this too.

688
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:33,110
What about scorn? You can't kill scorn. Oh, no, I don't think, I don't think scorn is part of this.

689
02:43:33,110 --> 02:44:02,629
Where do I go? Ooh, is this where we going? Memes have an expiration date. It'll happen naturally.

690
02:44:04,409 --> 02:44:17,590
It depends on what it is. All right. So this is all right. Where am I now?

691
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:21,819
This is back in the beginning. This is that like undead at Berg area.

692
02:44:22,459 --> 02:44:36,680
So I don't really want to be, no, I don't want to be here. They get unfunny,

693
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:42,420
then become legacy memes and then are funny again. I think after the kill the meme stream,

694
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:46,819
I, I think there was a lot of people that really came up with a lot of new stuff

695
02:44:47,459 --> 02:44:57,829
because of that shit. I mean, I guess I'm going over there.

696
02:44:57,829 --> 02:45:31,079
I just got magnetized to the ground. Whoa. Lacking any depth of its own,

697
02:45:31,079 --> 02:45:46,579
the sticks began poking into the depths of our world. Rude. Is this like bad what I'm doing?

698
02:45:47,299 --> 02:46:24,069
Why do they have that over their heads? Oh, they're cobalt. I get it. Okay. Friend curiosity.

699
02:46:24,069 --> 02:46:56,340
Memory of an inanimate object. Try patience. People, people saying, stop, stop, stop.

700
02:46:56,340 --> 02:47:13,100
This is 200 experience every time. Hold on. Wait, remembrance. What does that mean? Wait,

701
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:29,260
now they're in a different mode. This offhanded weapon is, is I'm never going to take this off.

702
02:47:29,260 --> 02:47:45,290
This thing is so good. Extra crit too. Oh, you have a lot of health.

703
02:48:03,319 --> 02:48:38,170
What is that? Strength. Heavy prying tool. Strength weapon. It's the half life crowbar.

704
02:48:38,170 --> 02:48:55,879
What does this one say? It's probably really funny. Actually kind of funny.

705
02:48:55,879 --> 02:49:12,979
One hit. Try rushing. All right. Actually be careful. I'll have a try rushing and then try

706
02:49:12,979 --> 02:49:32,120
patience. What was that? Okay. It's fine. What did you hit me with? Oh, I'm out of stamina.

707
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:50,549
Don't do it. Okay. I need, where is it? I know I have like two of them, right?

708
02:49:50,549 --> 02:49:55,610
Shit. I thought I got it off. I thought I killed them. Damn it.

709
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:12,459
It yelled like I do when I have a bug on me. Gold coins. Oh, just like a marker,

710
02:50:12,459 --> 02:50:49,819
which should censor the censor the word poop. What? It's not stable. I can't open it. This is

711
02:50:49,819 --> 02:51:12,409
locked. Oh, that's creepy. Was there another way to go? Is that it? Oh, suddenly a fire erupted

712
02:51:12,409 --> 02:51:52,649
to burn the kindling down. This is going to be a hard poll. So you're not, everybody's running.

713
02:51:52,649 --> 02:52:22,379
Okay. I don't have any more heels either. This is going to be pain in the ass. Thank God. I think

714
02:52:22,379 --> 02:52:44,840
he would like a hundred gecks. Um, we've listened to that on stream before coins. I didn't think

715
02:52:44,840 --> 02:53:05,620
he was going to turn around that quick. I thought he was busy mining chain mail. What is this damage

716
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:17,719
that bounces between enemies send out some loaded correspondence that damages one enemy and then get

717
02:53:17,719 --> 02:53:40,969
sent to additional enemies. That's funny. I really don't want to blow this and I'm probably going to

718
02:53:41,700 --> 02:54:16,629
whatever falling. Um, our one, please don't, I don't want to do this again. Just turn around and

719
02:54:16,629 --> 02:54:28,229
run. Oh my God. This is a wall. Uh, do I have any heels? Ah, I just probably woke somebody up. I'm

720
02:54:28,229 --> 02:54:59,559
sorry. Jesus. Thank God. I don't have any heels. Remember my newborn is crying. Well, go, go take

721
02:54:59,559 --> 02:55:11,639
care of your baby. Why are you, why are you writing that here? Hey, he's going to let you know my

722
02:55:11,639 --> 02:55:33,850
newborn's crying. Uh, chat. What should I do? I don't know. Is the baby hungry? Is the baby tired?

723
02:55:33,850 --> 02:55:39,750
I don't know anything about you or your life. I have no idea who you even are. I don't have any

724
02:55:39,750 --> 02:55:56,940
advice for your baby. Oh, you've got a magical enchanted to pickaxe. This is some Minecraft

725
02:55:56,940 --> 02:56:05,989
shit right here and he's going to kill me in one hit swing, swing it, swing it, please.

726
02:56:05,989 --> 02:56:13,670
Fuck you. Oh my God. Oh no, that was a weird animation. I don't know where this is.

727
02:56:14,469 --> 02:56:29,079
Shit. No, no, no, no. I do. I do. I know what this is. I know what this is. I know what that is.

728
02:56:39,829 --> 02:56:49,100
Be remembered ahead. All right, we got to go all the freaking way. Where was it? This way or that

729
02:56:49,100 --> 02:57:10,069
way? God, all the freaking way. Where was it? This is the wrong way. Isn't it? This is the wrong way.

730
02:57:10,069 --> 02:57:50,860
Isn't it? All right, come on. Do you have any tips? I just started the game. Um, it's pretty fun.

731
02:57:50,860 --> 02:58:16,059
It's, it's, I would hold on. Okay. It's yes. Do you have any tips? It's fun. That was, yeah,

732
02:58:16,059 --> 02:58:25,370
that was not a good tip. I apologize for that bad tip. I'll give you a real tip though.

733
02:58:25,370 --> 02:59:08,219
So dodge rolling is your friend. Hey, dodge rolling is your friend stuck. That's the wrong

734
02:59:08,219 --> 02:59:26,780
fucking way. This is the wrong way. Well, I have to kill everything now for the wrong way. It's,

735
02:59:26,780 --> 02:59:42,870
it's left instead of right. Go up that. I'm just going to say stupid, but you go up there and just

736
02:59:42,870 --> 03:00:03,370
go left straight. Do not go right, right. Lazy to the bottom of that thing. Okay. Move. That was

737
03:00:03,450 --> 03:00:50,950
absolute bullshit. This way. All right. Then we go, um, here. All right. This is new shit swing.

738
03:00:50,950 --> 03:01:29,219
What the hell was that? Okay. I got to pull you over here. Oh, God damn it. Sorry. One little

739
03:01:29,219 --> 03:02:10,139
piece of shit of life. Don't kill me. Chill, man. It's stressful. I, what do you mean? Chill. Okay.

740
03:02:10,139 --> 03:02:28,620
Um, so I was down there. You're going to cast that bullshit. Everyone's going to run down this

741
03:02:28,620 --> 03:03:12,020
hall. I don't want to fight in the water either. Rooting voice potion. Oh, nice. A green herb.

742
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:19,610
I have never seen a squirrel in real life. You haven't? I mean, that's not that weird.

743
03:03:19,610 --> 03:03:24,149
Where would, I don't know what part of the world you're from. Where in the world are there no

744
03:03:24,149 --> 03:04:01,780
squirrels? Okay. This is a conversation that I need to not pay attention to. Yeah. Squirrels are

745
03:04:01,780 --> 03:04:18,309
kind of interesting, I guess. Are there any squirrels in Vegas? I think so. I don't know.

746
03:04:22,329 --> 03:04:40,659
I think so. Although I can't tell you I've really, I haven't really seen any squirrels. Squirrels.

747
03:04:40,659 --> 03:04:50,059
Maybe. It's something I didn't put into my memory bank. This is a dangerous room. I don't know.

748
03:04:50,059 --> 03:04:59,340
There are two NPCs. Your lack of caution is what I fear. I would never fear that. Shh. Someone's

749
03:04:59,340 --> 03:05:23,000
coming. I might have to fight these people. Hello. You don't look like the forgotten we've been

750
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:28,520
slaughtering. Don't look like much of anything. Like we should criticize?

751
03:05:29,879 --> 03:05:37,239
True, true. What a ridiculously rendered three are we. Take our company, friend. I call myself

752
03:05:37,959 --> 03:05:45,239
nameless Nero. My companion is the lady Sco Peacutt. Just Sco, please. Nero's titles

753
03:05:45,959 --> 03:05:52,920
don't fit. We are pondering a most dubious task. A quest, I like to think. We don't have to be

754
03:05:52,920 --> 03:06:01,000
reckless to prove our worth. Ah, but we must when the world is filled. Assassin's Creed unity,

755
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:08,950
girl. That's funny. I can see the latent heroism in their stature. Not unlike my own. Would you

756
03:06:08,950 --> 03:06:16,709
help us, stranger? This quest might give my friend the value he needs. Shh. Really, you're bravery,

757
03:06:16,709 --> 03:06:25,430
Sco. I do not need aid, but I welcome a compatriot always. I'll do it. There is a creature down this

758
03:06:25,430 --> 03:06:33,350
corridor that seems not of this story. The lady is fascinated. While I seek cause to vanquish without

759
03:06:33,350 --> 03:06:41,350
question, that is evil as a thing we agree upon wholeheartedly. So I give you this quest. Well,

760
03:06:41,430 --> 03:06:48,469
actually, I share it. I, uh, gave it to myself first. Are you ready to face the unknown at our

761
03:06:48,469 --> 03:06:57,829
side? What about I don't have any heels. I knew it. Come my allies for today. We prove our worth.

762
03:06:57,829 --> 03:07:12,280
Let's go. You can do it. Suddenly victory. Holy shit. We have, what is this? All right. You guys

763
03:07:12,280 --> 03:07:38,459
fight it. That hurt a lot. Help them. I'm using these spells. I'm casting. We did it.

764
03:07:38,459 --> 03:07:56,440
Arachnid stinger. We did it. We're incredible. In nameless Nero, you have made an ally. Henceforth,

765
03:07:56,440 --> 03:08:08,659
our paths towards heroism are entwined. It's going to make me laugh every time. Oh, it was a quest,

766
03:08:08,659 --> 03:08:17,719
but I didn't really plan a reward. Ah, it's not much. That sucks. It is a token of my esteem.

767
03:08:18,440 --> 03:08:28,459
We shall be the forms the future follows. That sucked. I feel bigger. May we meet again,

768
03:08:28,459 --> 03:08:36,299
my friend. We would have failed without you friend. Nero means well with his quests and his titles.

769
03:08:36,299 --> 03:08:42,940
I suppose we each have to make meaning of this world or impose meaning upon it. Nero is certain

770
03:08:42,940 --> 03:08:51,299
of his path, or at least he's certain he has one for myself. I do wonder. Take this,

771
03:08:52,180 --> 03:08:58,180
a small token of my gratitude. That's a way better reward than yours. What was that creature? The

772
03:08:58,180 --> 03:09:06,219
pieces do not fit. What was that? I feel me. All right. What else? Anything that's down here?

773
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:28,680
Wait. Important, right? Hold on. Torch. Maybe. Maybe. No. Maybe. I did get some new weapon,

774
03:09:28,680 --> 03:09:52,020
though. What was that? Strength. Always check. Anything is vibrating down here. No. That's

775
03:09:52,020 --> 03:10:02,170
pretty cool. All right. Goodbye. I thought this game was going to be a 45 minute joke game,

776
03:10:02,170 --> 03:10:10,100
but this is actually cool as hell. I would very much agree with you. This has just been sitting

777
03:10:10,100 --> 03:10:18,729
in my Steam. I've just been waiting to play it. Just like, oh yeah. Okay. So I mentioned this

778
03:10:18,729 --> 03:10:27,420
months and months ago. I just had it in my Steam library. And I told you guys before,

779
03:10:29,979 --> 03:10:34,620
there's not going to be like, oh, should I play that today? Am I going to play that tonight?

780
03:10:35,260 --> 03:10:41,670
Maybe another night. I don't know. Might not be any good. No, we're in a new era. A new era of

781
03:10:41,670 --> 03:10:57,940
just play anything. And who cares? Wow. Double swing? Really? Why am I not swinging with this

782
03:10:57,940 --> 03:11:14,969
other weapon? Shit. All right. That looks pretty cool. Shaking. Wait, what kind of gear is this?

783
03:11:15,610 --> 03:11:41,829
This is way too heavy. Is it too heavy? I mean in fat rolling. Might as well just do it. Why not?

784
03:11:41,829 --> 03:12:16,149
Pretty cool. Ancient alloy. 2000. Fine. Oh, look it. It looks cool now. I still haven't unlocked

785
03:12:16,149 --> 03:12:29,780
this one yet either. That's pretty cool. But I got to keep this on. I guess I keep the pants on,

786
03:12:29,780 --> 03:12:43,739
right? Yeah. I like that look. All right. I don't want to blow this. I very much could.

787
03:12:43,739 --> 03:12:58,139
I need to go game progress route. I don't know where that is. Kind of turned around here. This

788
03:12:58,139 --> 03:13:34,219
looks accurate. I guess that's what the gold coins are for. Oh my God. I just swing already. You're

789
03:13:34,219 --> 03:14:08,680
driving me crazy. Swing already. You're driving me crazy. I'm not fucking around. Sorry. Not

790
03:14:08,680 --> 03:14:15,139
messing around. I have no health. You think I'm going to find my way back to this place? You're

791
03:14:15,139 --> 03:14:49,739
dreaming. Exploding. Whatever that is. Now he's being serious. Yeah. Because do you see how far

792
03:14:49,739 --> 03:15:00,969
down I am? I don't remember how I got here. You killed me through the door. I'm going to be

793
03:15:00,969 --> 03:15:46,500
very upset about it. Shit. Can I close the door? I'm dead. I am dead here. No. He turned around so

794
03:15:46,500 --> 03:16:21,670
quickly. I thought I had like another half second. The shrine was right there. All right. Dude,

795
03:16:21,670 --> 03:16:44,899
that's mad embarrassing. It is embarrassing. Okay. Then it was over here and then over here

796
03:16:47,370 --> 03:17:12,489
and then over here and then this way and then through here and then down here and then this way

797
03:17:12,489 --> 03:17:41,670
and this way and then down. Wait, there's this weird person down here. I forgot. Oh God. I'm down

798
03:17:41,670 --> 03:17:56,219
here with the fucking Minecraft guy. 5,000 souls about to be deleted. Wait, I can cheese the hell

799
03:17:56,219 --> 03:18:04,709
out of this. Where are my weapons? Where am I? What's going on with my weapons? They're all

800
03:18:04,709 --> 03:18:15,799
getting I was hoping just for a crit and just killed like three or four of them in a row.

801
03:18:15,799 --> 03:18:33,750
Fuck. Whatever. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Don't worry. Shit. Shit. Minus 5k. It's all right.

802
03:18:33,750 --> 03:19:09,559
We'll get him back. Bullshit. All right. Same deal. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This time it's

803
03:19:09,559 --> 03:19:39,829
is it this way instead? I think it's wait. I don't know. I went the same way. All right. I

804
03:19:39,829 --> 03:19:54,409
killed the Minecraft character. Does that do anything? Nothing in the water or anything?

805
03:19:54,409 --> 03:20:28,659
Oh shit. Uh, this is a shortcut. Yeah. Right. I'm not going to remember what this is. I mean,

806
03:20:28,659 --> 03:21:08,469
I know it exists though. I'm going to aggro that thing behind me accidentally. Aren't I friend?

807
03:21:08,469 --> 03:21:50,149
Foe? Oh geez. Okay. Green herb. Do you have a shirt on? I'm not going to confirm or deny if I

808
03:21:50,149 --> 03:22:19,379
have any clothing on. Well, I have that do, but not consider. Wow. Interesting. Minus two. Really?

809
03:22:19,379 --> 03:22:35,399
I am so far gone at this point. Yes. I'm going to go over there. Padlock. Oh, there it is. Oh,

810
03:22:35,399 --> 03:23:08,739
this is it. I made it. I made it. I actually made it. Okay. Cool. Oh, I have no stamina.

811
03:23:08,739 --> 03:23:25,350
No, please. Please. Please. No, please. Uh, um, this way. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Touch

812
03:23:25,350 --> 03:23:30,950
it. Touch it. Touch it. Touch it. Touch it. Touch it. Quick. Sit at it. Quick. Sit down. Sit down.

813
03:23:30,950 --> 03:23:53,819
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. I can't attack them. I don't have

814
03:23:53,819 --> 03:24:38,280
a good opportunity. Oh God. All right. Thank goodness. I definitely want more stamina. I can

815
03:24:38,280 --> 03:24:47,739
feel it. Uh, tether it here. Now I have a lot of crunchies. I think I'm going to use most of them.

816
03:24:47,739 --> 03:25:12,139
Yeah. Let's use them all. 500. That's it. That's nothing. That was a weird hiccup weapon upgrade.

817
03:25:12,139 --> 03:25:33,700
I don't see anything vibrating. Dexterity. Marking yourself with this willing. Wait,

818
03:25:33,700 --> 03:25:50,170
what does this mean? I did this. I wonder if these are permanent or is it just for a short

819
03:25:50,170 --> 03:26:47,590
duration? Okay. Kill on site. So where is the right way up? Up and around you. Ooh, item.

820
03:26:47,590 --> 03:27:24,540
Leonard's lounge shorts. There's a pair of boxers. I mean, that's a comedy. There's a comedy item.

821
03:27:24,540 --> 03:27:58,549
Comedy items are fine. I'm going to go across. Can I even go across? Maybe I could fall the bird

822
03:27:58,549 --> 03:28:15,860
armor on with the boxers. It's fat rolling still. Where's my weight? There it is. Load 87%. I wonder

823
03:28:15,860 --> 03:28:38,649
how much you need to have not fat roll 76. That's still fat rolling 37%. I think that's mid.

824
03:28:38,649 --> 03:28:47,479
Don't think much is this way. 31. That's actually really heavy. 61. All right. 60%. I think it's

825
03:28:47,479 --> 03:29:09,719
75%. We rate this out of 10. I think it's a little early to say that. Ooh, is something else down

826
03:29:09,719 --> 03:29:29,110
there? Weird. Um, I definitely can't drop the best way to go. I don't know. Is there like a

827
03:29:29,110 --> 03:30:07,739
better way to go? You should be fine if you jump. I was down here. Patience. No, there's no way.

828
03:30:07,739 --> 03:30:16,309
I am absolutely dead. I'm dead. So might as well just laugh. And that was kind of funny.

829
03:30:16,309 --> 03:30:53,979
I can't do it. Oh, you actually can't do it. Why did I even come over here? Well, you actually

830
03:30:53,979 --> 03:31:14,979
can't do it. That person was right. Okay. So where is the right way to go down and around?

831
03:31:14,979 --> 03:31:55,399
I don't know. Is there another? I can go in here. I think it's in here. No. All right. Deeper into

832
03:31:55,399 --> 03:32:08,489
the mine. Just just swing with the offhand. Honestly, the offhand just does way more damage

833
03:32:08,489 --> 03:32:20,010
in the combo. Can you tell me the germa meal? I want McDonald's. Um, grab yourself a McChicken.

834
03:32:20,010 --> 03:32:25,610
Look capable of besting the victims of Nostalgia's decay. The stick figure had

835
03:32:25,610 --> 03:32:34,329
not yet faced a healer. A great one. Such would reveal the futility of everything an old man

836
03:32:35,049 --> 03:32:57,049
and some sticks sought to prove. Oh, it's that guy again. Enemies ahead. All right. I'm not reading

837
03:32:57,049 --> 03:33:25,239
them anymore. Oh, you're going to come help me fight. We help. They like this consequences

838
03:33:25,239 --> 03:33:41,639
for each one of these tether. I can tether him. I don't know what that means. Sure. Why not?

839
03:33:48,870 --> 03:34:06,780
You coming? Oh, that's a lot of people. Are you coming or what? Grindr? What is it?

840
03:34:06,860 --> 03:34:10,299
What are these people supposed to be? That's a guy naked.

841
03:34:12,860 --> 03:35:09,020
All right. Don't die. Don't die. It's music. We do it. Uh, what on earth is that?

842
03:35:15,129 --> 03:35:22,659
Let's go. Holy shit. That was so much easier than I thought it was going to be.

843
03:35:23,299 --> 03:35:42,950
That was so simple. Oh no, it's, it's a joke. It's a joke. What? All right. What do we do? Jesus.

844
03:35:43,829 --> 03:36:37,260
What if my friend dies? No, he's going to die. Oh, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.

845
03:36:38,139 --> 03:37:01,819
Got it. And he stayed alive. The legendary. Thanks for the help. Actually, really thanks

846
03:37:01,819 --> 03:37:24,700
for the help because that probably would have been really hard. Why? Why would you even help?

847
03:37:29,620 --> 03:37:39,430
The Grindr's withered icon. Oh, that was supposed to be World of Warcraft players.

848
03:37:39,430 --> 03:37:46,489
That explains the naked guy, right? What is it? Increases heroic icon uses?

849
03:37:47,129 --> 03:37:56,520
The withered heroic icon of an obsessed hero, Amalgam. There was once something meaningful

850
03:37:56,520 --> 03:38:04,760
about this item. A legacy that can live on in you. Returning this to Astelgaia through her beacons

851
03:38:04,760 --> 03:38:19,590
will increase the uses of your own heroic icon. Interesting. What was the weapon? The Lair

852
03:38:19,590 --> 03:38:43,100
Generic. We were once distinct weapons. Our heroes grouping up beside the tavern's hearth strength.

853
03:38:43,100 --> 03:38:52,020
Very interesting. Um, well, that was cool. I'm going to go. Thanks for the help. These are

854
03:38:52,020 --> 03:38:56,020
probably a bunch of weird messages. Let's find out what this one says. I did it and I can't believe

855
03:38:56,020 --> 03:39:12,579
it. Yes, let's go. Your McDonald's order. Oh, um, McChicken and a large fry.

856
03:39:20,100 --> 03:39:29,110
Uh, maybe a McDouble. I've since tamed my, uh, my McDonald's order.

857
03:39:35,340 --> 03:40:15,819
That helps. Remember a head, but consider pixels. Um, what? A head? I mean, I think I'm just dead

858
03:40:15,819 --> 03:40:38,040
if I walk here. What the fuck? Oh, okay. What is with that aim? That just was targeting me.

859
03:40:38,040 --> 03:41:50,790
I'm trying to survive here. Unburdened. Ooh, unburdened. Oh, it's a quality weapon. Dex and

860
03:41:50,790 --> 03:42:59,000
strength. Does he even know he's streaming? What? What happened? I'm fucking live. I like the sound

861
03:42:59,000 --> 03:43:14,840
effects you make when you run. My crafter. When she discarded all the implements of tradition,

862
03:43:14,840 --> 03:43:21,260
all the tools of craftsmanship that had defined progress here before, I was among the refuse.

863
03:43:21,260 --> 03:43:51,049
Minecraft pickaxe or the bonfire. I'm all right for now. I'm all right. I'm doing good. You are

864
03:43:51,049 --> 03:44:17,819
literally shaking. Uh, watch out for left. Hey, look at that cheating. Like what happened? Why did

865
03:44:17,819 --> 03:44:45,399
my game fucking froze? Oh, my game froze. Um, where do I go from here? I straight up don't know

866
03:44:45,399 --> 03:45:18,219
where I am. Oh, I know where I am. Bridges down that way. Yeah. Okay. Actually I'm going to play

867
03:45:18,219 --> 03:45:32,629
here because I don't want to lose. I'm not, I'm not going to pull the whole room. That'd be so awful.

868
03:45:32,629 --> 03:46:36,299
Okay. Let's do it again. I don't even need to look. Lucky flow state. Oh, shut up. There's no way.

869
03:46:36,299 --> 03:47:06,659
Whatever. You should do an oil tier list. Uh, olive oil S. Um, peanut oil probably high A or low S.

870
03:47:06,659 --> 03:47:21,530
Crude oil. Uh, no, crude oil is probably like, I would say like probably a D. You know what I mean?

871
03:47:21,530 --> 03:48:08,040
That's like a D. Come on, let's go. I got 13,000 right now. There's got to be another bonfire

872
03:48:08,040 --> 03:49:01,860
coming up. I bet. Sunflower oil, seed oils. What about mineral oil? Eh, maybe a C. Don't, don't,

873
03:49:01,860 --> 03:49:16,709
don't, don't, don't. I almost died. All that to get all the way over here and pick this up. But

874
03:49:16,709 --> 03:49:36,329
what about that? The door. Um, what's the right way to go? What about lavender oil? That's not bad.

875
03:49:36,329 --> 03:49:59,450
Are they going to run all the way around? Actually this is incredible for me. This is the best thing

876
03:49:59,450 --> 03:50:26,540
that could have happened. They're all just going to leave. They're going the long way. They're all

877
03:50:26,540 --> 03:50:29,899
coming back. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. They're all

878
03:50:29,899 --> 03:51:16,069
coming back. Is this a dead end? No. Um, no, I go up. This is so stupid. Okay, let's go. Oh, not you

879
03:51:16,069 --> 03:51:23,819
again. Um, they're all going to make it up here eventually. I got to kill them one by one. What

880
03:51:23,819 --> 03:51:38,309
the fuck was that? I don't know what I just opened, but, um, I couldn't dodge. I just pressed it. I

881
03:51:38,309 --> 03:51:56,860
swear to God. I did just open something. What did I just open something? Anybody know where that is?

882
03:51:56,860 --> 03:52:09,850
That's a shortcut, but who knows where the hell that is. It's a door. It's some kind of door.

883
03:52:09,850 --> 03:52:18,870
Somebody said, dude, did you even try? I like that comment. Dude, did you eat? Nah, I was,

884
03:52:18,870 --> 03:52:46,790
I just like felt like just dying there. Is this this door which leads? No. All right, slow down.

885
03:52:46,790 --> 03:53:23,500
Anybody know anybody know where to go from here to get there? Oh my goodness behind you. So like

886
03:53:23,500 --> 03:53:50,969
through here and then there's another door somewhere. I don't think this is right down there. I don't

887
03:53:50,969 --> 03:53:59,579
remember. I could go across and then to the right, but is that where the door is? This is the way

888
03:53:59,579 --> 03:54:20,889
that I was straight through here, but where's the door? You know, Hey, do you know down there

889
03:54:20,889 --> 03:54:54,780
over there? Um, I think I'll be all right. I'm going to have like 20,000 souls. That shit took

890
03:54:54,780 --> 03:55:17,979
so long. You did this to yourself? Um, I got two heels. I'm fine getting there. Slow as shit right

891
03:55:17,979 --> 03:55:39,420
now. I'm so slow. I'm so slow in the fucking, in whatever the poisons swamp. Okay, we're good.

892
03:55:39,420 --> 03:56:01,500
This is where I left off was down here. I remember this. I don't even give him a chance. Stop being

893
03:56:01,500 --> 03:56:16,299
so cocky. I just killed this guy right here. Don't let him cast that thing and I should be fine.

894
03:56:16,299 --> 03:57:19,899
Okay. Nevermind. Oh, oh, oh, I got disappeared. That was really weird. All right. I'm so close.

895
03:57:19,899 --> 03:57:57,739
I can feel it. I think shaken. I'm going to be a level up like five times this bullshit. I remember

896
03:57:57,739 --> 03:58:29,450
this room. Uh, don't let him do it. Did you do it? He did it. I got full health though. Just don't

897
03:58:29,450 --> 03:59:04,149
be stupid. It's very simple. They have one attack pattern. Just wait. Everything's good. Who are

898
03:59:04,149 --> 03:59:33,340
you talking to? You. I'm talking to you directly. I'm talking to you right now. I'm speaking to you.

899
03:59:33,340 --> 03:59:40,309
All right. I'm almost there. I want to kill everything in this room because you know that

900
03:59:40,309 --> 03:59:53,049
I'm going to aggro it somehow. Some ways stupidly. All right. Made it. Now. Where is it from here?

901
03:59:53,049 --> 03:59:57,909
I remember going in there and freaking out. You got to run all the way up. They throw the bombs.

902
03:59:57,909 --> 04:00:31,899
Yeah. Everything's fine. Everything's shut up. Do not kill me. They're right here. Where are my

903
04:00:31,899 --> 04:00:54,469
souls? Thank you. Okay. Don't die. This person's freaking me out. Oh no. Um, okay. Where is there

904
04:00:54,469 --> 04:01:32,629
a lever to pull? You did it is kill. The hostile guy has been suffering because no one was removing

905
04:01:32,629 --> 04:01:42,489
her pain except me. I try to lift some of the burden from those who carry to gosh darn much,

906
04:01:42,569 --> 04:01:49,770
but actions speak louder than words. Now you're a hero. You, you get that. I have a gift for you.

907
04:01:50,729 --> 04:01:57,399
Relic from a friend I once helped. I have two of these. If you can use it to make

908
04:01:57,399 --> 04:02:03,479
hostile guy a super duper again, then I'm happy to part with it. Don't prick yourself.

909
04:02:03,479 --> 04:02:15,719
Oh, it hurts. Oh yeah. Oh, I can take it. All right. No more of that. No more of that.

910
04:02:15,719 --> 04:02:35,670
I just didn't, didn't know. All right. What about here? So I just said, what a freak.

911
04:02:40,500 --> 04:03:04,790
What you talking about me? 21,000. Let's go. I can level up five times. 25 luck, 15 stamina.

912
04:03:06,889 --> 04:03:23,670
What a mad man. What a bad man. Enemies dropped two times memory. That's going to be amazing.

913
04:03:23,670 --> 04:04:02,969
Look at this thing. Unburdened, unburdened. What's that mean? I know a few things. What do

914
04:04:02,969 --> 04:04:07,370
you think? Should I pivot to something else or this is kind of this thing. And on the offhand is

915
04:04:08,229 --> 04:04:30,520
amazing. I definitely want to keep this in my offhand 110, 109, 500. I don't know. Keep this,

916
04:04:30,520 --> 04:04:37,770
but replace the other thing. What do I really think? This is probably the best thing I have.

917
04:04:43,049 --> 04:05:06,069
One seven. That's a lot of damage though. 176. This is, has an upgrade. 184, 193. Yeah. This

918
04:05:06,069 --> 04:05:15,940
thing is amazing. I think I'm just going to upgrade this. Yeah. It's definitely this.

919
04:05:31,420 --> 04:05:39,989
Okay. Now, um, anything else? What is this thing versus heroic icon uses?

920
04:05:39,989 --> 04:05:50,420
Heroic icon is this thing that I, all right. So how do I use it? Is it the bonfire return icon

921
04:05:50,420 --> 04:05:59,110
release of withered heroic icon back into the world. Wait, what does that mean?

922
04:05:59,110 --> 04:06:11,860
Are we speaking Spanish right now? Hey, when are you going to come to Maryland for some crabs?

923
04:06:11,860 --> 04:06:19,639
I hope this is not going to mess something up. Your own heroic icon becomes stronger,

924
04:06:19,639 --> 04:06:35,299
increasing its uses. Oh yeah. Okay. Cool. Let's do it. Or very nice. I don't think I have any more.

925
04:06:35,299 --> 04:06:51,239
All right. I am ready. I got a new weapon upgrade. I go in here, then we go

926
04:06:54,120 --> 04:07:07,190
up and we go out and then we don't attack this. Let me go up and we continue. I'm really enjoying

927
04:07:07,190 --> 04:07:18,100
this. I think this game is actually really fun. I'm very much enjoying this video game experience.

928
04:07:18,100 --> 04:07:59,959
One more interface. Suddenly. Do I know that? Okay. New area. Maryland crabs are fantastic.

929
04:08:02,100 --> 04:08:10,280
I bet you they are. I can't say I've ever had a crab from Maryland. New England had a lot of

930
04:08:10,280 --> 04:08:17,100
great seafood though. Northeast had plenty of that though. So I mean, I kind of already got

931
04:08:17,100 --> 04:08:36,170
that experience. This looks bad. Carriage door. You guys are strong as fuck. Oh my God. And I

932
04:08:36,170 --> 04:08:42,309
know I said that I'm like 37. You know what I mean? But whatever. I gotta, I gotta use some

933
04:08:42,309 --> 04:09:03,659
of the lingo that you guys use, but did you have them with an old lady? Does that make it better?

934
04:09:03,659 --> 04:09:18,440
No, I have, I did not eat any crabs with any old ladies. Now is this old lady, uh, pressuring me to

935
04:09:18,440 --> 04:09:23,799
use a certain sauce that I don't want to use? No, no, no. You've put, put some of that, put,

936
04:09:23,799 --> 04:09:28,870
put that on there. Put it, you've been, yeah, I gotta put on more than that. I'll try it. Now

937
04:09:28,870 --> 04:09:39,899
there's not enough on there. Put it down. Now let me see. Let me, let me do it. Eating this person.

938
04:09:39,899 --> 04:10:04,840
Can you stop jumping, please? Oh, I like this zone. Castle. Why have you been obsessed with

939
04:10:04,840 --> 04:10:17,270
sauce lately? Who made it? Who made the first sauce is really just when did civilization actually

940
04:10:17,270 --> 04:10:28,969
begin? It's pretty much what that is. That's kind of what it is. Uh, where does this take me?

941
04:10:28,969 --> 04:11:30,620
First thing. All right. All right. Well, that's good to know. Can you do a live yoga stream?

942
04:11:30,620 --> 04:11:42,389
Dude, I'd pull a muscle and I would have to get taken out in a stretcher. So no, I would definitely

943
04:11:42,389 --> 04:11:46,389
be, oh, here we go. It's time. We've got like a whole room full of people and like there's like

944
04:11:46,389 --> 04:11:50,389
30, there's like 20 people in the yoga class, whatever. Oh, and there's the yoga instructor.

945
04:11:51,129 --> 04:11:57,139
And we're going to do a bunch of made up yoga moves that aren't real. And that's like funny.

946
04:11:57,139 --> 04:12:02,840
But at about 10 minutes into that stream, I'm going to go, oh, now we're going to do, um,

947
04:12:02,840 --> 04:12:07,639
you know, uh, the, the twisted Turkey and it's going to be some dumb move. And I'm going to do

948
04:12:07,639 --> 04:12:12,889
it. And I'm going to, you're going to see, I'm going to go, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

949
04:12:12,889 --> 04:12:18,459
And I'm going to roll over my back and then you're going to go to a BRB screen for 25 minutes.

950
04:12:20,629 --> 04:12:23,989
And then it's going to come back and there's going to be me being taken out in a stretcher

951
04:12:23,989 --> 04:12:27,700
and somebody from the crew or somebody else that was there is going to be like, Hey, sorry,

952
04:12:27,700 --> 04:12:32,620
buddy. But like, he pulled a fucking, he like tore a muscle on his knee or something or his leg.

953
04:12:32,620 --> 04:12:35,899
And yeah, we're going to have to stop the stream. Like, see you next time. I don't know. He's

954
04:12:35,899 --> 04:12:43,959
probably going to get, go to the doctor or something. That's why I don't want to do that stream.

955
04:12:43,959 --> 04:13:18,329
You're going to spawn another train, bro. Where are you going? See, I saw it. There it is.

956
04:13:18,329 --> 04:13:27,100
Make it Bugleberry's haunted yoga. This is a bunch of demons. People dressed up in like weird,

957
04:13:27,180 --> 04:14:13,770
like fucking monster costumes. Like in the middle of the yoga class, the door

958
04:14:13,770 --> 04:14:21,219
fucking burst open or like burst down. There's somebody like an adventurer being chased by like

959
04:14:21,219 --> 04:14:24,979
a giant dragon or something or two or three enemies and just fighting in the middle of yoga

960
04:14:24,979 --> 04:14:30,379
and Bugleberry doesn't give a shit. Nobody pays attention to it at all. It's just shit is going

961
04:14:30,379 --> 04:14:41,030
down. Well, I don't know where we are. Like these monsters, like kill the adventure and start like,

962
04:14:41,510 --> 04:14:51,049
eating them. We're not even paying attention. This just happens in this world. First is gold.

963
04:14:51,049 --> 04:15:43,000
Yeah, that hurt a lot. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. That's a hard one. This, I don't know. My

964
04:15:43,000 --> 04:15:50,170
grandfather built this place a hundred years ago. You probably need to add a zero, but I get what

965
04:15:50,170 --> 04:16:29,379
you're saying. Nice. Cracked wall. True. These people, 15 health, I think is probably good.

966
04:16:29,379 --> 04:16:39,479
Yeah. Hey dude, I couldn't help but notice that you haven't mentioned the fact that you spent

967
04:16:39,559 --> 04:16:43,559
$75 on Family Guy, the mobile game you have to stream. What's what gives

968
04:16:43,559 --> 04:16:57,190
it's you. Change makers often have good intentions, but they can't control the pain

969
04:16:57,190 --> 04:17:03,909
their changes bring. You know, it's a cycle. I don't know about you, but I just want to stop

970
04:17:03,909 --> 04:17:10,870
the suffering. Well, I'm a giver like that. The local great one was not a giver. He devoured

971
04:17:10,870 --> 04:17:16,229
Nostal Gaia's memories from within the player housing mansion up above.

972
04:17:16,229 --> 04:17:24,389
Desperate housing mansion. Oh, terrible things. And even the best of us. I know you can beat him.

973
04:17:25,930 --> 04:17:49,879
I believe in you. Oh, it hurts. Don't act like you wouldn't click. Don't act like you're not

974
04:17:49,879 --> 04:18:12,870
going to click to see what happens. Oh yeah. That's why you put all your points into luck

975
04:18:12,870 --> 04:18:19,930
right there. All right. So where's the, where's progress across the hall? Maybe

976
04:18:20,489 --> 04:18:29,909
well, greater the aggregate, everything. The emaciated toothpick felt the bite of

977
04:18:29,909 --> 04:18:48,729
Nostal Gaia's hunger. Stop. You don't just restart the area. Just kill me. I got to go to the,

978
04:18:48,729 --> 04:19:16,149
up into the left. Bad at video games, Andy. Just looking for that one crit. That's all you need.

979
04:19:28,659 --> 04:19:46,299
2000 souls down here. Not a big deal. Like that. Like that. Do you like, uh, crepes? I do. I'm a

980
04:19:46,299 --> 04:19:52,700
fan. I don't remember the last time I ate a crepe, but they're very good. You know what? I like,

981
04:19:53,750 --> 04:20:00,940
somebody might call me a weirdo for this, but I don't think they will. I like savory crepes

982
04:20:01,579 --> 04:20:07,540
more than sweet crepes. Please don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. You've reared your fist back.

983
04:20:07,540 --> 04:20:13,450
You were going to punch me. I just saw you do that and relax. What's, what's wrong with you?

984
04:20:13,450 --> 04:20:44,790
100% agree. Right. Confusion. Nice view. Nostalgia. I'm kind of curious. Does it? All

985
04:20:44,790 --> 04:20:54,139
right. I need to know. Will it take a half of a second to follow the bottom? This is a research.

986
04:20:54,139 --> 04:21:05,030
Is it going to take one 10th of a second to fall all the way? One, two, three, four. It's very far.

987
04:21:05,030 --> 04:21:18,469
Okay. You've seen all the other times I've fallen off. It's like been a magnet fall joke for research.

988
04:21:18,469 --> 04:21:58,360
Yeah. I got it. Can I bypass this person? All joke hypothesis. Yeah. You get it. Oh,

989
04:21:58,360 --> 04:22:08,229
shit. It's you. Oh my, I am a failure. What happened? They do not want me. Look at me.

990
04:22:08,229 --> 04:22:17,530
They do not want any of us. Nearly heroes are with the unproven, the unnamed. We follow in the

991
04:22:17,530 --> 04:22:28,340
footsteps of the greatest protagonists ever conceived. Why fail? I now realize we are only

992
04:22:28,340 --> 04:22:36,309
here to confirm our value. It wasn't I who vanquished the darkness in those minds.

993
04:22:36,309 --> 04:22:44,809
We both know it on the balcony above. I faced a foe. I could not best. She was fast and filled

994
04:22:44,809 --> 04:22:51,129
with conviction though. I did not recognize her story. She threw me down with the skill of someone

995
04:22:51,129 --> 04:22:56,170
whose story should be well known. I can handle this. Go. And I were separated when I charged

996
04:22:56,170 --> 04:23:04,780
into the confrontation. Be wary. If you go forth, I will stay here to be forgotten. The nothing that

997
04:23:04,780 --> 04:23:11,020
I am wrote. Give any idea how much money I've put into this game. This sword alone is worth

998
04:23:11,020 --> 04:23:24,040
probably 15 to 1600 dollars. I'm going to be just fine. You wish to uplift me heroic quest in itself.

999
04:23:24,120 --> 04:23:34,520
It's futile friend. I am no hero. Whoa, wait a minute. I have a shield of inspiration.

1000
04:23:34,520 --> 04:23:44,709
Should I give it to him? Yeah, sure. What is that a relic? You would have me remember myself through,

1001
04:23:44,709 --> 04:24:01,690
but it can't even remember itself. You wish it's few. Okay, so I need to remember the shield

1002
04:24:01,690 --> 04:24:12,469
heart flow altar. So that's in the first area. So I have to get the memory from the shield,

1003
04:24:12,469 --> 04:24:23,530
bring it back here, give it to this guy. I wonder what that is. Should I go look for it? That's way

1004
04:24:23,530 --> 04:24:33,049
back. Too much work. Well, I feel like this is part two of this quest and I kind of feel like

1005
04:24:33,049 --> 04:24:39,100
I want to do it. Yeah, why not? I want to do it. I have no idea where I'm going. Can somebody just

1006
04:24:39,100 --> 04:24:46,340
tell me, can somebody give me exact directions? And I'm talking like walk forward five seconds,

1007
04:24:46,340 --> 04:24:50,500
turn left, walk forward five seconds, turn right, walk forward 10 seconds to give me all the way

1008
04:24:50,500 --> 04:24:59,659
back. It'd be like really helpful. I'm going to try it. See if I can know where the hell I'm going.

1009
04:24:59,659 --> 04:25:18,280
I need to tether though, take a ride at the taco bell. Let me tether here. It's back where you first

1010
04:25:18,280 --> 04:25:36,680
met that old man. Okay, so I'm here in the theater. All right. Uh, I'm to backtrack. There is that

1011
04:25:36,680 --> 04:25:43,000
elevator, right? Which brings me out. Yeah, let's go back. I want to see what happens. I might get a

1012
04:25:43,000 --> 04:26:21,180
cool item or something. If I was an item over here. I can't get it. Can you fast travel? I don't know.

1013
04:26:21,180 --> 04:26:34,709
That's a good question. Maybe I can. That's a great question. Okay, we're not quite there. I need to

1014
04:26:34,709 --> 04:26:44,040
go back even further. You can only TP to your tether. All right. So I remember going, oh,

1015
04:26:44,040 --> 04:27:10,149
shoot. It's a boss. It's through here. Let's get out of this way here. Um, okay. I remember this.

1016
04:27:10,149 --> 04:27:26,569
Now we go back here. Uh huh. This is where the old man was sitting. Is it here? No, we're all the

1017
04:27:26,569 --> 04:28:00,760
way back here. That's not the tutorial zone. Is it? Where did I first meet that guy? It's right after

1018
04:28:00,760 --> 04:28:25,219
the tutorial. So right here, this game feels like a, like just dance 2016. All right, here we are.

1019
04:28:25,219 --> 04:28:48,219
And we're in this zone. Come on. What does it say? My siblings and I encouraged pledging heroes

1020
04:28:48,219 --> 04:28:53,020
through their doubts and toward their purpose. Purpose ultimately found rest in the style guy's

1021
04:28:53,020 --> 04:29:04,709
heart somewhere beneath her central shrine. So under low, how do I get under here? Oh, wait a

1022
04:29:04,709 --> 04:29:43,719
minute. How do I get down there? Okay. Right here. Yep. Remember. Very cool. All right. So

1023
04:29:43,719 --> 04:30:01,219
now I can, how do I teleport back? Do I have an item? This one is a multiplayer. Oh, okay. Cool.

1024
04:30:01,219 --> 04:30:22,069
Reminds me of a midi evil for the original PlayStation. I could see that. That'd give us

1025
04:30:22,069 --> 04:30:58,569
you. You can't be serious. Stop. Oh my goodness. I just want to complete the quest. Yep. Well,

1026
04:30:58,569 --> 04:31:56,969
I know where I'm going. No more stamina. I already, I'm just getting absolutely just dominated by

1027
04:31:56,969 --> 04:32:24,440
these people. Okay. All right, let's go. Hey dude, I'm trying to do surgery on somebody. Can you

1028
04:32:24,440 --> 04:32:37,159
please keep it down? I'm just in the operating room. All right. Here we go. You wish to uplift

1029
04:32:37,159 --> 04:32:52,809
me. It's you. What is that? This is thank you. Thank you. Fellow hero. We are heroes. We, we

1030
04:32:52,809 --> 04:33:06,419
together. Our company defines us. Yes, I am the great self named nameless Nero. As with my title,

1031
04:33:06,500 --> 04:33:14,900
so too am I the determiner of my actions. Thank you, friend. I shall don this with pride.

1032
04:33:14,900 --> 04:33:19,779
For was it not I who vanquished the darkness deep within the minds?

1033
04:33:23,849 --> 04:33:33,099
It's true. You did do that. Soon. I shall resume my quest. I will be immortalized in the pantheon of

1034
04:33:33,099 --> 04:33:40,060
heroes. You'll be there too. I think. Hope so. Soon you'll be. All right. We make progress.

1035
04:33:40,060 --> 04:33:55,779
See you in the next random spot. You're going to be standing. The irredeemable sliver persisted

1036
04:33:55,779 --> 04:34:08,229
onward witnessing what nostalgy might once have been and what it had become. Here wings. You are

1037
04:34:08,229 --> 04:34:28,169
a weirdo. Hey, I'm currently watching this on a roller coaster. Can you please keep it up? Like,

1038
04:34:28,169 --> 04:34:41,720
turn it up. Memory of an NPC zone boss. That's funny. Watching like YouTube shorts on a

1039
04:34:41,720 --> 04:34:49,830
roller coaster is, I think, peak 2023. Don't you think? I mean, this is not a YouTube short, but

1040
04:34:50,389 --> 04:34:59,159
you know, you get it. Watching a Twitch stream is like, no, what do you think? It's a gamer joke.

1041
04:34:59,159 --> 04:35:16,040
Why'd you say YouTube shorts? Because you guys watch YouTube shorts, don't you? No. Is YouTube

1042
04:35:16,040 --> 04:35:32,680
shorts the not cool one? You guys watch TikTok? Yes. Yes. Oh, fuck. I'm going to be relatable

1043
04:35:32,680 --> 04:35:52,599
to the younger generation and I screwed it up. Shit. Get off me. Blood of a blood of a blood

1044
04:35:52,599 --> 04:36:25,700
of a blood. What is that? Applies recursion. Nice try. Brain piercer. Let's try it again. Wait,

1045
04:36:25,700 --> 04:36:58,549
I hear something flying. Lucky hit. Why does everybody bite you? Oh, how do I get over there?

1046
04:36:59,189 --> 04:37:25,479
I think we're almost at the boss. Something terrible ahead. Oh, it's a toilet. You know,

1047
04:37:25,479 --> 04:37:35,880
my buddy stopped watching the stream. L plus U fell off. I just imagine you sitting in a Discord

1048
04:37:35,880 --> 04:37:46,950
call with a friend. You're both watching the stream and this friend is just like, oh, yeah,

1049
04:37:46,950 --> 04:37:53,540
I don't know. I'm not a big fan of Germany anymore. Nah, I like I'm out of here. Maybe if

1050
04:37:53,540 --> 04:38:02,299
you want to play like fucking like a battle of vapex, whatever the fucking game is, just let me

1051
04:38:02,299 --> 04:38:08,299
know tomorrow or whatever. And you know what? It's hard to talk and play at the same time a

1052
04:38:08,299 --> 04:38:21,689
game like this. So never mind. But why would you be? Never mind. I don't even know what I said.

1053
04:38:21,689 --> 04:39:10,310
There's a gun. It's just trash. Stupid. Your job is to talk and play games. You know how hard it

1054
04:39:10,310 --> 04:39:21,349
is to talk and do anything? Hey, you know what? My job is whatever I want it to be. How does that

1055
04:39:21,349 --> 04:39:26,009
sound? Sometimes I do a comb stream where I just comb my hair. Is that a video game? No.

1056
04:39:26,810 --> 04:39:49,819
Sometimes I'm on camera doing something. Is that playing a game? No. He's rebelling. Yes. Yeah,

1057
04:39:49,819 --> 04:40:05,049
I am. Yeah, let's go. I'm rebelling. I'm afraid of this room. I can't imagine you on camera.

1058
04:40:05,049 --> 04:40:22,340
It's gross. You don't want to see it. This thing's just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1059
04:40:22,340 --> 04:40:56,330
wait. The ground is moving. This is a lot nicer toilet. Oh, look at failure. Oh, it's Sonic the

1060
04:40:56,330 --> 04:41:13,099
Hedgehog. Cute. Funny. That's a cute little reference. I'm okay. Somebody was in the doorway,

1061
04:41:13,099 --> 04:41:15,900
but I don't want to go that way because I think that's the boss. And I want to try to see if

1062
04:41:15,900 --> 04:41:24,919
there's anything over here I can find, like a bonfire that I can get level up with. And I'm

1063
04:41:24,919 --> 04:41:38,360
thinking that's probably down here. Scope cutter. Wait. Oh, it's the Assassin's Creed Unity person.

1064
04:41:38,360 --> 04:41:45,209
You have a different weapon. Peculiar world, isn't it? Nero confronted a woman upon the tower

1065
04:41:45,209 --> 04:41:53,419
behind us. He fell, but he wasn't broken. What? The being he fought was, I'm not sure. I think

1066
04:41:53,419 --> 04:41:59,819
she's connected to something larger. She's not forgotten. That's for sure. Though I worry for

1067
04:41:59,819 --> 04:42:10,389
Nero, I think it's time our paths diverge. Oh, no. I met a creature. It called itself the Reservoir

1068
04:42:10,389 --> 04:42:18,540
of Pain. It had a generous smile, but a heavy heart. It gave me this blade as a gift. I think

1069
04:42:18,540 --> 04:42:24,779
it feels Nostalgaia's suffering in a profound way, but also yearns to ease that suffering.

1070
04:42:26,729 --> 04:42:33,319
I can imagine nothing more heroic. Can you? I need to wear better clothes. I look like a fucking

1071
04:42:33,319 --> 04:42:41,240
dickhead. Sometimes I feel to try and understand it all like like a finger staring at its hand

1072
04:42:41,240 --> 04:42:48,439
or its arm or its whole body. A thing trying to glean its purpose from the thing it is a part of.

1073
04:42:48,439 --> 04:42:54,599
Though my body lacks much sense at all. So perhaps I've spun a feudal metaphor.

1074
04:42:55,819 --> 04:42:59,419
Voice work is really good in this game. Actually pretty surprising that it is

1075
04:42:59,419 --> 04:43:05,340
considering it's, you know, sometimes that's the last thing that an indie developer thinks about is

1076
04:43:05,340 --> 04:43:14,819
stuff like that. But it's very, very, very good. Everything's very well done. Feels very good to

1077
04:43:14,819 --> 04:43:23,959
play. I can imagine a lot of times if you're an indie game developer and you make this game and

1078
04:43:23,959 --> 04:43:31,529
it's like, oh shit, I have to, I have to hire a bunch of voice acting or, you know, however it

1079
04:43:31,529 --> 04:43:44,250
works, I guess like an expense. Okay, Roger Ebert, play the game. What the fuck? I am. What are you

1080
04:43:44,250 --> 04:43:55,290
talking about? I'm so, that tells it to me so much. Oh, hey, isn't it your, isn't it your job to play

1081
04:43:55,290 --> 04:44:00,490
games? Let's talk about like something in the industry. Hey, no, don't do that. Don't do it.

1082
04:44:00,490 --> 04:44:13,799
I don't want to hear you say anything about that. All right, now I'm going to die because I'm not

1083
04:44:13,799 --> 04:44:23,860
paying attention. I'm dead. I'm dead. And I blame that person for that. Let's have like a conversation

1084
04:44:23,860 --> 04:44:36,889
about like, you know, the industry. In the mod chat right now, I'm surprised your chat knows who

1085
04:44:36,889 --> 04:44:57,860
Roger Ebert even is. Yeah. All right. I got to get over there before I lose all my souls.

1086
04:44:58,419 --> 04:45:19,139
Sometimes the stream feels like how long can 10,000 people bully a 40 year old man

1087
04:45:19,139 --> 04:45:29,159
until he turns his stream off? I, I do not agree. I don't agree. What you said was funny,

1088
04:45:29,159 --> 04:45:44,299
but I disagree. You've got to be kidding me. And I had an opportunity right there.

1089
04:45:45,020 --> 04:46:00,500
There we go. You see that flourish. Yeah. You see that snap right there at the end.

1090
04:46:00,500 --> 04:46:11,669
Did you see that snap finish? That was actually bullshit. That was like a double animation.

1091
04:46:15,029 --> 04:46:37,669
Cherries. Where did I even die? I hate Jerma. I hope he reads my comment and gets sad in that

1092
04:46:37,669 --> 04:46:49,500
person. You know what? How does this sound in that person for an hour? Yeah. But one full hour,

1093
04:46:53,130 --> 04:47:09,349
one full hour, and then let them repent and then reduce it five minutes.

1094
04:47:09,909 --> 04:47:28,259
Be please land because you just land and mess everything up. Oh my God. That move is so annoying.

1095
04:47:29,060 --> 04:48:00,500
I'm just running. No, I need my shit. Hold on. What is this? You tell me this was right here

1096
04:48:00,500 --> 04:48:23,110
the whole time. God damn it. This is one of those Superman all arcade games. What does that mean?

1097
04:48:23,110 --> 04:48:38,020
I had the exact same question. Am I missing something? Do I like butterscotch? I do.

1098
04:48:38,020 --> 04:48:46,090
Butterscotch is good only in very, very small doses though. You can really overdo butterscotch

1099
04:48:46,090 --> 04:48:57,540
and it'll ruin everything. All right. Let me go on out here. It's like pesto. Yeah, that's true.

1100
04:48:58,099 --> 04:49:11,259
Butterscotch on ice cream, just straight up vanilla bean ice cream with butterscotch hot.

1101
04:49:11,259 --> 04:49:18,869
Then you let that rest and then you eat it after it kind of solidifies a little.

1102
04:49:18,869 --> 04:49:24,360
You know what I'm talking about? When it gets to that point where it sort of

1103
04:49:25,180 --> 04:49:40,700
becomes one with the ice cream drizzled. Let me out. I want to get that item. Whatever.

1104
04:49:40,700 --> 04:49:48,490
And then I don't even get me talking about this. At the very end, you have this weird mixture at

1105
04:49:48,490 --> 04:50:02,790
the bottom of the cup. It's this weird fucked up liquid, isn't it? Super Mario Castle? It's this

1106
04:50:02,790 --> 04:50:16,819
weird, weird liquid that's kind of, if you know, you know, it's kind of runny ice cream, but

1107
04:50:16,819 --> 04:50:29,209
weirdly solidified almost butterscotch bits. And it's probably the best part. Where did I die?

1108
04:50:29,209 --> 04:51:00,520
Where did I die? Right there. Shot. So sloppy. Okay. I just looked over a chat and somebody said,

1109
04:51:00,520 --> 04:51:04,630
take those boxes off now. And I was going to ban you. I was going to have you get banned

1110
04:51:04,630 --> 04:51:07,430
because I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? And I'm like, wait, right.

1111
04:51:07,430 --> 04:51:18,090
I was about to be like, yeah, big ban. This person's being a weirdo. Like, what the fuck

1112
04:51:18,090 --> 04:51:27,639
are they talking about? And they go, right. Okay. But you are right. Okay. What's my total weight?

1113
04:51:27,639 --> 04:52:22,470
That's actually not bad. Coward. Coward. Coward. Dead in one hit. Jesus. Almost there. Shut up.

1114
04:52:22,470 --> 04:52:30,709
There's no way. Spear enemies are the worst in any video game. Doesn't matter what it is.

1115
04:52:30,709 --> 04:52:37,049
Across all platforms, across all genres, across all console generations, across every game,

1116
04:52:37,049 --> 04:52:42,650
across every arcade cabinet, across every dice game. It doesn't matter what it is across every

1117
04:52:42,650 --> 04:52:49,049
tabletop game. It doesn't matter what it is. Spear enemies are the worst enemies in all media

1118
04:52:49,049 --> 04:53:13,560
because spears are superior to swords. Yeah. We all saw, we all saw that history channel video

1119
04:53:13,560 --> 04:53:24,729
or show like who would win samurai or a medieval warrior. We've all seen it and we all know that

1120
04:53:24,729 --> 04:53:47,220
spear is the best weapon. We all saw that the samurai lost to the caveman. Caveman have club

1121
04:53:47,220 --> 04:53:52,580
and raw chicken. And that's, I mean, we all saw it. And then it was the tier list they made and

1122
04:53:52,580 --> 04:53:58,330
the caveman came out on top every time. It was weird because they even went as far as to, what

1123
04:53:58,330 --> 04:54:04,360
was it? They did like modern stuff too. And the caveman beat modern military person with weapons

1124
04:54:04,360 --> 04:54:13,669
like guns and stuff, which is, I don't know how strange. I think it's just the force that a caveman

1125
04:54:13,669 --> 04:54:19,240
could swing a club. It was like 600,000 pounds per square inch or something, something crazy,

1126
04:54:19,240 --> 04:54:35,130
more than like a dinosaur jaw. That didn't happen. You're an idiot. Well, what did I watch then?

1127
04:54:35,130 --> 04:54:40,380
What did I watch then? Huh? What did I watch? I'm being weird tonight. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1128
04:54:40,380 --> 04:55:26,740
You got to put these stupid, I hate being up on these rafters. Come on. What worth it? Not really.

1129
04:55:26,740 --> 04:55:39,380
Do I have any heels? Cherry. Oh, brain piercer. I can, oh wait, I got multiple memories here.

1130
04:55:39,380 --> 04:56:03,130
Quack strut, pixelating cane, concealing a telescoping blade. This is a dex weapon.

1131
04:56:03,130 --> 04:56:27,080
Joust. I mean, this is a sorceress, a sorcery weapon, whatever. Is that it? Is there any more?

1132
04:56:27,080 --> 04:56:43,479
I'm really interested in this one. Where is it? Quack strut. I really hope I was, I think I,

1133
04:56:43,479 --> 04:56:58,650
I think I'm all right. This thing is awesome. I want this. All right. So this is, yep,

1134
04:56:58,650 --> 04:57:10,889
is the plan. This is a, like a poke. This is a slash. I think this is the right call. This is

1135
04:57:10,889 --> 04:57:44,009
a spear. It's a sharp weapon. Wristless tooth. I hate those things. Um, there's more to do in here.

1136
04:57:44,009 --> 04:58:10,900
I need, I need, when you're talking about me having no health, that's when you're talking,

1137
04:58:10,900 --> 04:58:14,340
you know, when you're talking about having no health, right? That's what I'm talking about.

1138
04:58:14,340 --> 04:58:36,470
When you're talking about the damage sucks ass, but it doesn't matter what's in my main hand.

1139
04:58:36,470 --> 04:59:16,709
Anyways, all my upgrades in my offhand. Shit. You know what? Just play it safe. There is an item

1140
04:59:16,709 --> 04:59:58,540
over here. And is that an NPC? Holy shit. Everything's fine. I'm, I, I think I died.

1141
04:59:58,540 --> 05:00:04,310
No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight you.

1142
05:00:04,310 --> 05:00:21,590
I don't want to, don't fucking come at me. That's the only thing I could think of.

1143
05:00:21,590 --> 05:00:36,200
Okay. Thank God. So what is the item? There's another person too. Holy shit. That went right

1144
05:00:36,200 --> 05:00:59,659
by my face and I got grabbed. I tried so hard. It was so stressful because I knew I was backing up

1145
05:00:59,659 --> 05:01:03,799
into the wall and I didn't know where the staircase was behind me. Something shit.

1146
05:01:03,799 --> 05:01:12,869
I don't know how far back I can go. Oh, I don't know how far I am. I'm just going to run. This

1147
05:01:12,869 --> 05:01:18,650
is actually, no, no, no. I got the, um, I got the shortcut here. Not as bad as it could be.

1148
05:01:18,650 --> 05:01:37,349
That show was called Deadliest Warrior. Yeah. Why can't I, Deadliest War, Deadliest War we're,

1149
05:01:37,349 --> 05:02:03,110
why am I saying like Deadliest Warrior? It's not that far. This thing is cool. Should I,

1150
05:02:03,110 --> 05:02:22,549
should I upgrade the cane? This is the wrong way, isn't it? This guy stinks. Oh, by the way,

1151
05:02:22,549 --> 05:02:28,299
tomorrow, if you did not know, I mentioned it in the beginning of the stream, but let's bring it

1152
05:02:28,299 --> 05:02:37,259
up again. Tomorrow is a sponsored stream. I'm going to be playing Wild Hearts, Monster Hunter

1153
05:02:37,259 --> 05:02:50,979
kind of game. It seems pretty fun. And I believe I'll be playing it with Vinny. So that should be

1154
05:02:50,979 --> 05:03:02,659
fun. This actually was a pretty good question. I'm going to, I'm going to answer it. I kind of,

1155
05:03:02,659 --> 05:03:10,180
I can't alt tab. Um, somebody asked, that's not a bad question. What do you do genuinely if a game

1156
05:03:10,180 --> 05:03:19,430
sucks? That's a good question. I'm going to answer it as best as I can in about five minutes when

1157
05:03:19,430 --> 05:03:29,560
this room is clear. Spear is such a bad weapon. Honestly, give me a club. Shit was way better,

1158
05:03:29,560 --> 05:03:34,729
way stronger. Just huge surface area to just hit somebody in the fucking face with. So much better

1159
05:03:34,729 --> 05:04:08,409
than a spear. Give me a huge club. Almost there. Now you land. All right, go ahead and do it,

1160
05:04:08,409 --> 05:04:19,400
please. You're just not going to do it. You're just going to die. Um, what do you do if a game

1161
05:04:19,400 --> 05:04:27,529
sucks? There's a couple of options there. So if a game, when you say sucks, you mean the game is

1162
05:04:27,529 --> 05:04:33,340
genuinely bad. Like I can't, I cannot stomach even playing it anymore. Then I will, I won't,

1163
05:04:33,340 --> 05:04:40,220
I'll stop. I'll move on to something else. If a game sucks just barely enough, I will typically

1164
05:04:40,220 --> 05:04:47,479
stay with it. Cause you never know when a kind of a dumpy game gets, might actually get really fun.

1165
05:04:47,479 --> 05:04:53,459
There's definitely been opportunities where I thought the game wasn't that fun. Then an hour

1166
05:04:53,459 --> 05:05:00,840
goes by and it's, I'm having a great time. Very, very good example of this was Dark and Darker.

1167
05:05:00,840 --> 05:05:05,159
Uh, the first hour or two, Dark and Darker, I was like, this game is fucking an ass. Why do

1168
05:05:05,159 --> 05:05:10,709
people play this? And I may have stopped, but I kind of played it for a little longer. And it

1169
05:05:10,709 --> 05:05:13,509
was like, no, no, no, wait a minute. This is actually really fun. I really, really like this.

1170
05:05:13,509 --> 05:05:21,139
This is awesome. You gotta be careful. You don't know if the game actually sucks or not, or if

1171
05:05:21,139 --> 05:05:30,340
you're just not giving it the time and the kind of brain power that it deserves. You never know.

1172
05:05:30,340 --> 05:05:39,189
And also everybody has such different opinions on stuff that a game that I say sucks. Oh,

1173
05:05:39,189 --> 05:05:53,080
this game's ass. What a terrible fucking game. This might be your favorite game of all time.

1174
05:05:53,080 --> 05:06:09,740
Right? Like it could be a thing that you really, really enjoy. So many different opinions. What's

1175
05:06:09,740 --> 05:06:17,669
the time tomorrow? Oh, same time. Probably around six. This is the way to get in here. Uh huh.

1176
05:06:17,669 --> 05:06:35,799
Where, where did I, I don't know. Where did I die down? No, I came through this way. No,

1177
05:06:35,799 --> 05:06:44,069
I never got the item. That's right. I died in here. This is going to be really stupid and really bad

1178
05:06:44,069 --> 05:07:38,939
idea, but I don't care. Where's my shit. Goodbye. Was there anything else in here? Shit. I have to

1179
05:07:38,939 --> 05:08:30,740
go that way. See you get down to the bottom. Almost there. Ooh. All right. Important. Wait,

1180
05:08:30,740 --> 05:09:10,069
anything, anything vibrating? Oh, come on. This staircase just fucking ruined everything, dude.

1181
05:09:10,869 --> 05:09:20,150
Why everybody ran all the own? Oh, that's bad. That's very bad. That's so bad. I'm so fucked

1182
05:09:20,150 --> 05:09:38,409
here. Wizard, help. Wizard, please. They're all just single file. Dude, help. Oh my goodness. Okay.

1183
05:09:38,409 --> 05:09:49,529
I need to do this so much faster than me because he has to, he drank my fucking fluid. So whatever

1184
05:09:49,529 --> 05:10:43,299
it was, there's no way. Nope. I have to be a total coward here. I'm sorry. It's scary. It's

1185
05:10:43,299 --> 05:11:11,369
intense. I'm sorry. Jeez. Okay. Everything's fine. That was gnarly. I just don't want to run all the

1186
05:11:11,369 --> 05:11:46,419
way back here. Hey, we're not doing Bugleberry's yoga class yet. All right. Very, very cool.

1187
05:11:46,419 --> 05:12:26,279
Whoa. I didn't even see that. Way too much to lose. Hmm. Do you think? All right. Now let me

1188
05:12:26,279 --> 05:12:47,319
actually pay attention to what, uh, I feel like they might be stuff blowing in here. Tooth? No.

1189
05:12:47,319 --> 05:13:01,319
Staying in a regen on parry. Please tell me everything you just said again. You've put the

1190
05:13:01,319 --> 05:13:10,659
show as your answers or has the struggle to discover been taken from you? Have you been

1191
05:13:11,299 --> 05:13:21,130
gifted direction? Hmm. For my part, I seem to remember more as you struggle. There's value in

1192
05:13:21,130 --> 05:13:29,369
that struggle. In struggle. I'm certain of it. The past, even in its pain, gives meaning to the

1193
05:13:29,369 --> 05:13:36,650
future. I wonder, you have no doubt seen the flickering doors throughout Nostalgia. They are

1194
05:13:36,650 --> 05:13:43,450
chasms with no path forward because they hold no memory of what they were. What might happen

1195
05:13:44,169 --> 05:13:50,250
if you offered memory back to these, these forgetting spaces? Why don't you try

1196
05:13:52,389 --> 05:13:57,909
it? It can be restored. Offering some of your collected memory. Place your stick arm on this

1197
05:13:57,909 --> 05:14:11,909
flickering door. You gotta pay. That's it? 50 memory. That's nothing. Like two, that's two quarters. Oh.

1198
05:14:12,709 --> 05:14:26,790
I expected as much. Tis not only objects that are forgetting themselves in Nostalgia. Her

1199
05:14:26,869 --> 05:14:39,380
hostile denizens may also be affected by your generosity. Your weaponless stick arms do more

1200
05:14:39,380 --> 05:14:43,220
damage. They also have other effects. For example, try punching an enemy's shield.

1201
05:14:44,250 --> 05:15:14,470
Wait, what do you mean? Unarmed playthrough? Oh, there's another playthrough. That's cool.

1202
05:15:14,470 --> 05:15:21,189
The past and future are inseparable. The future cannot be interpreted without the

1203
05:15:21,189 --> 05:15:28,069
context of the past. And if the past is meaningful, it is only so because of the

1204
05:15:28,069 --> 05:15:38,180
future it enables. Your own meaning, hero, is becoming clearer to me. Restore our memory,

1205
05:15:38,180 --> 05:15:51,799
personal, as much as pragmatic request. Restore. I will try. You gave back the useless, ugly

1206
05:15:51,799 --> 05:16:19,750
abomination gave back. One of those pothead people. I'm dead instantly. I died in one hit.

1207
05:16:19,750 --> 05:16:58,419
This is so far. And it was 18,000. Wait, I did get a shortcut. I forget where it is. I unlocked it.

1208
05:16:58,419 --> 05:17:12,619
Ah, it's too late. I don't know where it is. I don't remember. It was right next to the

1209
05:17:12,619 --> 05:17:28,279
bonfire. Ah, whatever. We want you to be scared more. You don't get to demand anything from me.

1210
05:17:28,279 --> 05:18:16,139
No more demands. How does that sound? It's gonna run. I just aggroed everything here for no reason.

1211
05:18:16,139 --> 05:19:14,330
There it is. I'm coming. Be there shortly. Hitbox on that is just broken. All right, where am I

1212
05:19:14,330 --> 05:19:19,990
going? There's like, there's three ways for me to go. There's this way, which is where the pothead is,

1213
05:19:19,990 --> 05:19:37,819
and then there's up through there. Should I fight the pothead? Don't even start with this bullshit.

1214
05:19:37,819 --> 05:19:55,159
Oh, you're so annoying. Back off. Shortcut is through that door. All right. All right, round two.

1215
05:19:55,159 --> 05:20:47,020
Let's, uh, win by cheating. Oh my god, you kill. I just crit your weapon. That was stupid. Anti-hero

1216
05:20:47,020 --> 05:21:37,610
establishment. Anything glowing? No. New area that way. Gems and jewels. Chasm ahead. Wow, look at

1217
05:21:37,610 --> 05:22:05,689
hilarious thing. I want to see the funny thing. Where is it? What is it? Quest reward vault.

1218
05:22:07,000 --> 05:22:14,259
Imagine if you can being strung to a thing which you love, but which you cannot save.

1219
05:22:15,060 --> 05:22:28,950
Hmm. Imagination requires depth scribble. Five of these can be remembered. Nothing in this room.

1220
05:22:34,389 --> 05:22:59,740
Weird. Why do I, it sounds like glintstone. Sure it is. Conversion of it. Oh, wait. How much?

1221
05:22:59,740 --> 05:23:15,619
A thousand bucks to open this. Better be worth it. Unburdened. Another one. Okay. Strength and

1222
05:23:15,619 --> 05:23:28,779
dex. All right. Is there a bonfire down here? Not. Does the game have powers dancing? It

1223
05:23:28,779 --> 05:23:43,419
actually might. Fuck that. I'm just going into the vault. They can fight each other for all I care.

1224
05:23:43,419 --> 05:24:03,740
Oh, not you again. All right. What is it? Oh, a lot of anguish out there, isn't there, good buddy?

1225
05:24:03,740 --> 05:24:12,139
Oh, geez. Yeah, there is. Oh, remember that sweet sword I gave you? Powerful, right? I can give you

1226
05:24:12,139 --> 05:24:18,939
more powerful artifacts. All you have to do is bring me the relics you find that are burdened

1227
05:24:18,939 --> 05:24:27,259
with memories. I can absorb their suffering. Their longing. So you don't need to solve their

1228
05:24:27,259 --> 05:24:34,380
mysteries. Instead, you'll get to wield super duper awesome versions of them to beat up whatever

1229
05:24:34,380 --> 05:24:41,979
bad guys you chase. And their liberated husks won't have any memories left to burden you with.

1230
05:24:41,979 --> 05:24:54,119
Win. Wait, what? Unburdened. Unburdened relics are stronger, but lose their lore and special

1231
05:24:54,119 --> 05:25:14,200
ability. This cannot be undone. Oh, you turn it in. You probably can go the other way. I'm

1232
05:25:14,200 --> 05:25:18,279
imagining there's somebody in the game that can. Because I have three weapons that are unburdened

1233
05:25:18,279 --> 05:25:26,259
already. Just for pure damage. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of. Maybe I should just do it to this. Do I

1234
05:25:26,259 --> 05:25:34,180
really care what this does? Don't do it. Lore is important. It can't be, cannot be undone. So, oh,

1235
05:25:41,159 --> 05:26:05,509
five thousand bucks. Sure. What a waste of money. But is this, does this get consumed?

1236
05:26:05,509 --> 05:26:16,819
Is it, can I just put it on or is it like a talisman? I'm afraid to use it. Oh, how did I

1237
05:26:16,819 --> 05:26:30,729
not even look down here? Oops. I haven't even looked down here. Uh, health regen.

1238
05:26:32,119 --> 05:26:41,979
Probably dexterity. Yeah, how much is that? 20 decks. That's a lot. How much is that giving me?

1239
05:26:41,979 --> 05:26:55,860
That's five decks. Oh my goodness. That's a lot. Okay. Nice. Don't you play games for a living?

1240
05:26:58,709 --> 05:27:26,819
No, I don't. How could I? Okay. What else is out here? Crown of the undone. New hat.

1241
05:27:26,819 --> 05:27:40,419
A pixelating warlock's crown. The murders of my NPC retaliated where his corpses were dumped.

1242
05:27:40,419 --> 05:27:59,770
Uh, in the World of Warcraft cave? 8.1 and 11. What does degradation mean? I think this thing's

1243
05:27:59,770 --> 05:28:21,830
just better. Very interesting. I'm going to keep moving. I hope there's a bonfire. Easy maker key.

1244
05:28:22,389 --> 05:28:44,169
A key to a crate of smuggled easy maker goods. What is that? Depths. Oh, this is another shortcut

1245
05:28:44,169 --> 05:29:01,479
somewhere. Good game design, but try patience. Is that a joke? Is that making fun of the game?

1246
05:29:01,479 --> 05:29:29,340
Try patience. What? Oh, wait, this wraps back into here. Okay. No. What is this? Some kind of

1247
05:29:29,340 --> 05:29:44,380
currency thing? Quest reward vault. Wasn't there a door in the starting area that was flickering?

1248
05:29:44,380 --> 05:30:17,779
I think you're right. That's one way. That sound is getting louder. You know what's kind of cool

1249
05:30:17,779 --> 05:30:27,479
about this game? It's scratching that from software itch. It just is actually very well made.

1250
05:30:27,880 --> 05:31:03,430
This is like really good. It's cool. This is a cool game. What's wrong with my weapon? What's wrong with

1251
05:31:03,430 --> 05:31:39,110
my weapon? Why am I holding my weapon so weird? Um, why am I holding it like this? I like this area.

1252
05:31:39,110 --> 05:32:00,919
Didn't see me, right? All right. The play here is wait till he turns around. Go turn it on and

1253
05:32:00,919 --> 05:32:19,479
everybody will kill him. That's the plan. Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,

1254
05:32:19,479 --> 05:32:49,259
fight. Everybody come out and fight. Fight. Yeah. Chaos. Chaos. Chaos. Oh shit. You all did it.

1255
05:32:49,259 --> 05:33:26,169
Uh, I'm in trouble. I need to heal. Fridge. What is it? Bucko blade. Bucko blade. This is

1256
05:33:26,169 --> 05:33:34,500
definitely strength. Yeah. A pixelating really, really, really big sword. My wielder was frequently

1257
05:33:34,500 --> 05:34:08,060
sized up at a place where being stung was sought as a delight. Little pink guy. This is so dangerous

1258
05:34:08,060 --> 05:34:49,020
right now. Get me out of here. They're following me. How did all of you make it out alive? He didn't

1259
05:34:49,020 --> 05:34:56,470
kill one person. He's the hugest guy in this whole dungeon. How are you? Every single one of you is

1260
05:34:56,470 --> 05:35:05,020
alive. Oh, there's a wall. There's a wall. There's a wall. Holy shit. I almost got hit. My heart just

1261
05:35:05,020 --> 05:35:11,689
like stopped. My game, my game went down. I have to use the, okay. I have to, I'm using the literally

1262
05:35:11,689 --> 05:35:24,169
the OBS preview to play the game. My game minimized. I can't see anything. It's on the OBS preview.

1263
05:35:24,169 --> 05:35:34,709
Oh my God. How do I pause it? What happened? What? That was okay. That was insane. I don't

1264
05:35:34,709 --> 05:35:45,290
think you even saw that. That didn't translate it. My game went down. How many layers are in this

1265
05:35:45,290 --> 05:35:58,490
fucking dungeon? Nobody saw it. Weird. My game went down. Oh, I'm putting this on. It's like, relax.

1266
05:36:11,450 --> 05:36:34,979
Geez. Right. Oh my goodness. This like hurts my head. And if you see, I think so. Finally,

1267
05:36:34,979 --> 05:36:45,740
time for old blade to face the chasm. No, wait, you don't serve my captors. You're one of us.

1268
05:36:47,540 --> 05:36:51,700
Never thought I'd meet a young spawn again. Yeah, it looks like I think it is dragon slayer.

1269
05:36:54,619 --> 05:37:07,029
No, I had pressed it accidentally. Everything's fine. Face the chasm. No, what a sad ending. That

1270
05:37:07,029 --> 05:37:15,590
would have been... Oh, I'm sorry. One of us. Never thought I'd meet a young spawn again. My game

1271
05:37:15,590 --> 05:37:29,209
went down. I lost my courage, see? Lost my heroic icon with it. Listen, I can tell you're a good kid.

1272
05:37:29,209 --> 05:37:37,020
I've sent enough heroes to know. If you find my icon out there, maybe, could you return it to me?

1273
05:37:37,099 --> 05:37:43,259
I want to be meaningful again before this whole thing ends. Do we have it already?

1274
05:37:46,169 --> 05:37:49,450
Ain't no reason for me to leave this cell. I'm meaningless.

1275
05:37:50,409 --> 05:37:54,970
Honey, if they'd have thrown me in the chasm, at least there'd be no memory of my shame.

1276
05:37:56,250 --> 05:38:03,240
Get out there and save the day. Ain't no reason. If they'd have... You still got heroism in you,

1277
05:38:03,240 --> 05:38:22,939
kid. I can tell. Get out there. Do we not have his item? Well, somebody will... One of you guys

1278
05:38:22,939 --> 05:38:32,490
please remember where this is. Fuck, I will not. Dude, you're a walking Christmas tree.

1279
05:38:33,130 --> 05:38:42,020
I think I look pretty cool. This is bad, and I think I'm going to...

1280
05:38:43,159 --> 05:38:52,380
Uh, hmm. I think the plan is to just take one of the... Yeah, I'm gonna... Uh-huh. Uh, yeah.

1281
05:38:55,990 --> 05:39:11,700
Maybe another time. You went really far back. Um, it's really not. End of the stream, voice?

1282
05:39:16,150 --> 05:39:20,439
Yeah, it's probably a good place to stop. What the fuck? Why'd that guy say that? Don't tell

1283
05:39:20,439 --> 05:39:29,099
the teacher we have homework. We are going to finish this. You will see this game be completed.

1284
05:39:32,060 --> 05:39:54,740
Because I think it's really, really good. 28 luck. Something new. Healing costs nothing. Yeah. Uh,

1285
05:39:55,560 --> 05:40:01,720
from what I have gathered, I believe there's only probably... I think we're about halfway.

1286
05:40:01,720 --> 05:40:08,069
The game's about 10 to 15 hours, depending on how slow you play. I don't know about completionist

1287
05:40:08,069 --> 05:40:13,939
stuff, but it's probably like 12 to 15 hours. I, uh, I would love to finish it. I think it's great.

1288
05:40:14,580 --> 05:40:22,819
But that is not what is happening tomorrow. Although, it might. It might happen after.

1289
05:40:22,819 --> 05:40:30,150
Tomorrow, I'm going to be playing Wild Hearts, sponsored. First sponsored stream of the year.

1290
05:40:30,150 --> 05:40:35,369
It's been about three months or so. Looks really fun. I'm looking forward to it. Hey!

1291
05:40:38,330 --> 05:40:53,099
Somebody... I am so sorry. But yeah, uh, Vinny and I are going to be playing it. I think that's the

1292
05:40:53,099 --> 05:40:57,990
idea. If there is any changes or any updates, I will let you know. Keep an eye on the sus. That's

1293
05:40:57,990 --> 05:41:04,779
the plan for tomorrow at 6 PM. And after that, I might just come back into this. We'll see. Or

1294
05:41:04,779 --> 05:41:10,779
maybe we'll play that. Vinny and I might play it for longer. I don't know. We will figure that out

1295
05:41:10,779 --> 05:41:17,479
tomorrow. But that's the plan. Sponsored stream tomorrow. And see you later. Can you give it a

1296
05:41:17,479 --> 05:41:27,500
rating yet? Um, I don't think you can. I don't know. You can't rate some stuff. I would tell you that

1297
05:41:27,500 --> 05:41:40,419
this is worth playing. It's, it's very good. I very much enjoy this game. In fact, I think it's great.

1298
05:41:40,419 --> 05:41:45,380
But I don't know. Oh, it's an uh, it's an eight. It's an 8.3. Nah, it's just great. It's just a great

1299
05:41:45,380 --> 05:41:53,139
game. That's all you need to know. It seems like there's a lot of kind of depth somehow, even though

1300
05:41:53,139 --> 05:42:04,340
it's like a parody game. It's very, very good. Plays very well. Runs very well. It's voice acting.

1301
05:42:04,340 --> 05:42:10,979
The story seems pretty, I'm, I'm engaged. I would like to know what's going on. I think it's great.

1302
05:42:10,979 --> 05:42:20,630
There you go. Is my review in progress. I think it's great. And with that, I'll see you guys

1303
05:42:20,630 --> 05:42:31,700
tomorrow. 6 PM Pacific. Let's check out Wild Hearts. Very cool. Do I have to save it or anything?

1304
05:42:31,700 --> 05:42:41,909
Yes. Okay. There we go. Uh huh. See you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother.

1305
05:42:41,909 --> 05:42:54,020
Bring some water. Eat a couple of broccoli. You know what to do. We need the music. That's right.

1306
05:42:54,020 --> 05:43:08,330
You do. Let me get out of here first. There we go. Save and quit. Okay. And play us out.

1307
05:43:08,330 --> 05:43:20,419
Is the entire stream going to be that one game? Probably not. Vinny and I will play Wild Hearts

1308
05:43:20,419 --> 05:43:26,979
for a while. I don't know. If we, if I'm having a great time, I probably just won't stop. What if

1309
05:43:26,979 --> 05:43:40,659
I want to pivot at some point after I'm done with the sponsor? We'll see. Take care. Good night.

1310
05:43:41,299 --> 05:43:47,459
Get some sleep. What about Sorcery and Frog Detective? Well, I did promise Frog Detective

1311
05:43:47,459 --> 05:43:52,580
would happen before the end of February or I was going to, I don't know. I was, I don't know. I

1312
05:43:52,580 --> 05:44:05,979
was going to do something weird. So that will happen. Write the yoga stream down. I will.

1313
05:44:06,540 --> 05:44:25,529
I'm looking forward to finishing this game. What about Sorcery? I know. I got to find a spot for

1314
05:44:25,529 --> 05:44:38,119
it. There's a lot of games that I've just kept on the back burner for a long time. The goal is to

1315
05:44:38,119 --> 05:44:45,369
play through most of them. You ever practice your voices? Yes, I do. Um, on twitch.tv slash German

1316
05:44:45,369 --> 05:44:58,869
nine, eight, five, a couple of times a week. Pretty much what you hear. What about Breath of

1317
05:44:58,869 --> 05:45:04,330
the Wild? I'll, I will make sure to finish Breath of the Wild before the new one comes out.

1318
05:45:05,049 --> 05:45:17,099
There's your other promise or I will, I will. All right. Good night. Shameless plug. Yeah,

1319
05:45:17,099 --> 05:45:23,930
sorry. I'm shouting out a twitch channel here. Is there anywhere to suggest older games? There

1320
05:45:23,930 --> 05:45:30,340
is a place for it in the discord. There's the recommended channel. You have something you,

1321
05:45:30,340 --> 05:45:34,659
a lot of, I think this game you're seeing right now, I took from recommended a few months ago.

1322
05:45:35,220 --> 05:45:40,630
I could be making that up, but I don't think I am. Yeah. I check it all the time.

1323
05:45:41,189 --> 05:45:51,479
I always pull from it. Have a great night. See you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves.

1324
05:45:52,299 --> 05:45:58,259
If for some reason we play through a lot more Wild Hearts tomorrow, then we will finish

1325
05:45:58,259 --> 05:46:24,580
Last Hero of Nostalgia a day or two later. It'll be the next time we finish. Good night, guys. See you tomorrow.
