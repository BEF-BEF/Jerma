1
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:08,939
So we're gonna we're gonna be playing more of the sims one, which is fun.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,099
And I'm hopefully you guys understand what I just said.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,780
Oh, you pretended you were doing this, Mike. It's been beautiful the entire time you've been here.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:29,260
I'm in one minute. Everyone needs to relax. Do a face reveal.

5
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,990
I don't, I don't. All right. Don't, just don't feed into the trolls. That's what they are. They're

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:46,710
trolls. Don't feed into the trolls. I'm not gonna play your game. I'm not gonna feed into the trolls.

7
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:59,000
He's naked. I am. I might be the only streamer on this whole website that streams naked

8
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:11,819
and won't get banned for it. Imagine they catch me on a technicality or something.

9
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:21,079
What are they? Hold on. I gotta protect. Let me protect myself very quickly. I'm not naked.

10
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:39,060
I'm just partially nude. The difference. No, I'm not in a bathtub. I promise. Juggles, juggles, juggles.

11
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:49,140
Yeah, I know. I'm like, you can hear that. He's in the bath. We're gonna play more of the sims one,

12
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,930
obviously. I had a lot of fun with it. Gonna actually try to make real progress today.

13
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:06,150
Had to burn a whole house down and leave a small child without parents. That was not my intention

14
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,930
when I started the stream yesterday. Hope everybody's doing. I forgot to say well.

15
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:18,469
Hope everybody's doing. I actually kind of like that. Hope you're doing. Hope everybody's doing.

16
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:30,099
I like that. I think I'm gonna use that. Hope you're all doing. Yeah, I like it.

17
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:44,860
I think it's good. Did I tweet? Why are you live? Because I'm a streamer. Once a week streamer.

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:58,659
Sorry about that. We fixed that before we get started. Why say lot words? What? Why say lot word?

19
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:12,599
Like what do I say? I don't know. It's either you guys or the wall, okay? If I did not have a stream

20
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:20,150
come on and just talk, I would likely just be pacing around and just like talking about like

21
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:27,289
my favorite foods and stuff. I would call my mother. I would talk to my mother. I'd be like,

22
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:32,740
I would talk to my mother like four or five times a week. Of course, by the way, I talked to my mother

23
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:41,080
once a week. When was the last time you called your mother? Do it today. When was the last time

24
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,219
you called your damn mother? She's waiting for your phone call. That's what you don't understand.

25
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:04,979
Say hello. Call her right now. No, I'm not gonna do that to my mother. That's like a weird prank.

26
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:14,460
Bring up my mom. Oh, hi, Jeremy. Oh, hey, mom. Oh, hey, you're on stream. Like, oh, thanks for the call.

27
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,100
You're using me as a prop. You're using me as a set piece for your fucking clown stream. Thank you.

28
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:29,050
Good to hear from you, son. I'm not using my mother as a prop for that one time when they,

29
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,170
when I had the dinner stream and that was a disaster. So I'm not doing that again.

30
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:50,329
All right, you guys ready? Are we all here? I hope so. Are you here? All right, so we left

31
00:04:50,569 --> 00:05:03,610
how do we leave off? I'm excited. I like this game. Very hard, but I like it. So we left off

32
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:17,290
at, you're talking about, no, it wasn't. Hair reveal. All right, you guys ready? You've

33
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,500
ruined an entire family and made a child insane. No, that's not what happened. Go adopt Caramel.

34
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:36,779
I don't think I can do that. This is The Sims 1. You can't do that in The Sims 1.

35
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:44,759
Okay, here we go. What was the last thing I was doing? This house is pretty sick, actually. I

36
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:51,829
like this place. Friends. That's right, right, right. Friends. And I don't want to be a chef,

37
00:05:51,829 --> 00:06:05,240
too. Let's get some, let me open up my fucking, I don't care anymore. I'm just doing it on stream.

38
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:22,899
And the acting career. That's right. Well, first things first. We gotta sleep. That was a bugle

39
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:29,420
berry. That just, that sounded like bugle berry. Where the fly is coming from? What's going on

40
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:45,620
here? I'm leaving. We just got here. Oh, I get it. Okay. Hurry, get out of bed. It just took me like

41
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:56,149
an hour to turn around and get out of the bed. Did I make that noise? It wouldn't be out of

42
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:17,800
the ordinary. Yuck. I do that shit. Oh, God. Get the, all right. Water. Don't forget to do this.

43
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I think a lot of you guys severely underestimate just the amount of noises that I make on a daily

44
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,620
basis. I'm not even like aware of it sometimes. I just kind of, it's like I'm doing like my own

45
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:45,879
soundtrack. Oh, we know. All right, let's go. I kind of don't even want these. I'd rather have

46
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,620
statues. What's wrong? Oh, fun. All right. Go to watch, go turn the TV, watch TV for a little

47
00:07:51,620 --> 00:08:00,120
while. And then we're going out on the town. I like to imagine you would do those noises at an

48
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:16,310
inappropriate time, like at a funeral. Um, no. Sit down and watch the TV. You doy, doy, doy at the

49
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:37,559
funeral. That would be so. No, that would be me giving the, um, was it the eulogy? The eucanoo.

50
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:45,590
Just prank me. No, that would be me giving the eulogy. And everybody at the funeral would all

51
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,309
do it at the same time to honor that person. Like it would be me. If I, okay, if I'm dead,

52
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:56,549
whoever's doing the eulogy, if you're hearing this right now, you need to get the entire, um,

53
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:10,649
funeral session to do doy, doy, doy in unison to honor me. And it has to be loud enough

54
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:17,059
so that at least one or two people in the, in the, I don't know, the church or wherever we are,

55
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:33,370
are holding their ears, going like, think about having that in a church, how much that would just

56
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,179
bounce off the walls. I think we might summon like a demon if we did that. That's probably how

57
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:46,950
you do it. Just like doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy doy. Stop it, stop it. You're going to summon him.

58
00:09:46,950 --> 00:10:05,139
Don't, please. A demon. Venus music. That's right. That's going to resurrect me.

59
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:16,490
Well, people are doing that. I start slowly like lifting out of the coffin.

60
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:27,450
This that's terrifying. All right. Take a shower. Is this clean? No, no, no, no flush the toilet and clean it

61
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:33,220
This is so stupid. Can I like go into like a like the text editor and make this not happen anymore?

62
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,389
I understand that people can be slobs, but i've i've never flushed the toilet like that's not a personality trait

63
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:57,820
That's seriously not a personality trait. He's depressed. You've never flushed. No, I mean, you know what I mean? Like i've never not

64
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:06,299
Flushed the toilet. He doesn't flush it for personal reasons. No, he's

65
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,220
It he just has like two neatness and that apparently means you don't flush toilets

66
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,559
You're doing the doi doi thing muffled in the coffin and that's the way to make everybody there

67
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:34,629
Well, that's the way how people know they have to do it. They just hear like he's in there everybody. Let's do it

68
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,490
Oh, okay. How many people would run out of there? That's like a we need to run out of here and get out

69
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:58,309
Oh quick dinner quick dinner quick dinner. Don't sir. Don't just like have they say there. Yeah. Oh, I need a food processor, too

70
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:09,750
I remember that I remember that food processor. It makes the food better. Where is it? There it is

71
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:17,210
Where can I put this right there? Hey those bills?

72
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,509
Oh, I only have 1200 bucks. I need to go gamble some more things that you should never say

73
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:36,600
Okay, never mind. Will you stream your funeral? I don't know

74
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,570
We're kind of in like a weird world with that like our generation

75
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,600
It's like the first generation that would probably think to do something like that, right?

76
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:50,809
And when I say our generation, I mean 18 to 34 i'm not even in that i'm not even there anymore

77
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:59,500
But i'm just gonna pretend I am I think we're the first ones that would actually do something like that

78
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,700
He's all placed like this

79
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,039
Okay, so the uh

80
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:23,799
The the delivery person I have never taken these in so they've just started to play a game

81
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,980
They put it on each one of these I didn't hear them blend in and they'd like fuck it with me

82
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,990
OCD mailman

83
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,210
No, I think it's I have not taken them in ever so instead of just putting them in the same spot

84
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,210
They're just like well fucking whatever i'm gonna have some fun

85
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,460
That's why that thing popped up and said that there's no more room

86
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,659
Okay, turn the cartoons off

87
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:03,960
Geez is there any more?

88
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:10,519
No, okay, clean this up and then I need to find I need to get a chef job, right?

89
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:22,500
Yeah, why are we playing it seriously now? Um, I don't know because I spent like four hours

90
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,539
Destroying an entire family

91
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,500
Last yesterday when we played I spent the first like four and a half hours like just actively ruining everything

92
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:45,370
I want to be a superstar and i'm gonna get there. I want to be a superstar chef musician. No, thanks

93
00:14:45,529 --> 00:15:03,929
This house is fucked though. Why is the bathroom in the kitchen? It's not it's a different room animal care

94
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,639
Oh, I want to take it but I want to be a chef

95
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:17,340
Why do I care about being a chef so much? Why I don't understand why I just take the animal job

96
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:30,120
Why do I care about being a chef it's because hold on i'm doing the animal one there's a glass door on the bathroom

97
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:50,570
You should learn magic medicine I thought there was only because I have three skill points in cooking that's right business

98
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:56,340
Took you 30 minutes to stand up and sit down again

99
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,059
Politics, no, thanks

100
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,740
In fact, I want to like send like the I want to send like a thing back to that person

101
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:15,820
It just says just I want to I want to click the unsubscribe on that one. Let me know

102
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:17,659
Oh, okay

103
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:22,039
It just unsubscribe actually unsubscriber is just a big lie

104
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,259
And they don't actually do it and now they have you now

105
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:30,389
They have the info that you've actively clicked on one of their emails, you know what I mean?

106
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:39,750
I'd always like freak me out

107
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,750
They keep your info, but they take you off the mailing list

108
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,799
I need to go out again

109
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,879
I need to call somebody over and have somebody hang out with me

110
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,220
Info is worth more than you

111
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,259
You know

112
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,259
I don't understand that

113
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,240
Why is all of our why is all of our basic info like that's so?

114
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,940
So valuable

115
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:16,069
Is how old you are don't we have a census like why don't they just go like fucking download the census?

116
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:31,019
What are they actually doing? Why do they need to know? My name is jeremy elbertson. It's for it's for ads

117
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,309
You know once we started not caring about tv. They were just always gonna find a way to fucking get us

118
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:43,289
I always thought that advertisements were just gonna go away once nobody cared about tv anymore

119
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:55,740
Oh, no, why are you so obsessed with the census? When was the last time I said the word census on this stream?

120
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:07,619
A year ago, when did I say what was the last time I said I referenced the census?

121
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,529
Stop doing that. Hey, stop putting them in weird places. Just put them on the ground

122
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:29,589
Hire a maid. I don't have enough money to do that. I need to go get like a i'm gonna go i'm going to the casino

123
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,839
Oh, I remember what I was doing. I was gonna call somebody on the phone hang out and watch tv with them

124
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:47,980
I don't want to look for a job. All right, well then call somebody over. Where's there? Okay, aren't we friends?

125
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:57,380
Everyone's at work. Oh nice. Okay, she's coming over should I put

126
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,269
All right, this is not a good look in your pajamas at your computer while cartoons are playing in the background

127
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:15,109
I don't know if this is a great look for someone to come over for the first time. It's literally you

128
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,670
Yes, it is. Yes, except take off the top

129
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:28,119
That's a lip. That's actually me right now take this off, but I don't have cartoons blaring in the background

130
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,980
I have to get rid of these too. This is creepy

131
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:43,769
Oh

132
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:46,650
Oh shit. Oh, I can't get up right now

133
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,349
No, dude, i'm like the last i'm top 10 last 10 in pub g I can't get up

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,589
Yeah, I don't want to fuck this up. Is that for me?

137
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:21,619
Wow

138
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:28,410
Oh, I can't just throw it in the trash

139
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,259
Shit, i'm sorry. Am I gonna throw it down the magician hole?

140
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,059
Wait, why did I not put it down?

141
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:46,519
Imagine handing somebody a gift and they walk around through their backyard with no shoes on why wouldn't they go in the house?

142
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,720

That's just extra water from the pool

186
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:23,859
This is like when you go over your mom's friend's house because I missed that but it was probably really funny

187
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,440
It's zero. This person's been over all day fucking talk

188
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:36,059
Just crying

189
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:46,380
Oh my god, this is horrible. You don't like science. What do you like? What does this girl actually like?

190
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,740
I don't think she likes anything

191
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,740
This dog is smelling me

192
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:59,819
You like sunshine I like the sun

193
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,099
Oh my god, let me just tell you about the sun. I love when it goes behind the clouds

194
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,660
I love when it goes out. Oh me too. I love when the sun goes behind the clouds

195
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,440
I love when it gets the next overcast day. All right, talk about weather

196
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:19,130
Just keep them locked in this state

197
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:34,440
Okay, just sit here and talk you like ties I love ties

198
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,180

201
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:53,900
Do you like the sun? Yes. I love the rain too

202
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
What a boring conversation

203
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,140
We're we're okay, we're doing the the short

204
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,259
Like how's the weather kind of like you don't want to talk to somebody

205
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,619
You got like 30 seconds on the sidewalk. We're doing that for like four hours

206
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,839
Do you imagine bringing up to like the person in small talk on the sidewalk the weather like eight times

207
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,490
It'd be like holy shit

208
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,930
Somebody has to end this conversation. This is horrible. We're probably never going to talk ever again after this

209
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:30,339
Take a shower. No social is more important than ever now

210
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,750
Skunk is whatever

211
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:44,549

I'm not gonna wake. I can't wake her up

213
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,549
What the fuck

214
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:58,390
Why can't I not wake her up?

215
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:10,359
When is she gonna wake up and leave?

216
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:18,359
I won't even I won't even wake her up and be like hey, there's a couch here

217
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:48,380
She's gonna wake up and okay. Thanks for coming

218
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:03,829
Why did she pass out? Why wouldn't she have left? All right, the the well is running dry right now

219
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,829
I need to really work on money

You smell like shit and you pissed yourself and you're in a pool you invited her over

222
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,339
You never changed out of your pajamas

223
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,059
What the fuck just happened?

224
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:41,849
Why is everything in this game? I'm too depressed the sims universe has the shittiest plumbing. The plumbing is so bad

Let's get a butler. Okay, I'm gonna get a butler for one day and I'm gonna invite that girl over again

244
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:31,110

247
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,159
I appreciate actually, you know, why would I do that?

248
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,360
I could just pay one of my buddies like 20 bucks to do that

249
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:49,340
In fact, I know there are like movies like 90s comedy movies where it's like the guys like goofy friend is the oh

250
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,019
Yeah, but just just you look great. You look great. Just like act like you're my butler at the door

00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:58,519
He's got like greasy hair and I like that throw it back and I try to make it look nice for that

252
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,690
Yeah, you stand for the door. All right. Thanks, buddy. You owe me a six-pack

253
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:11,860
Yeah, I do and then the guy ruins it somehow. I mean that's I could do that. It's an Adam Sandler movie

254
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,320
Yeah, I think that actually happens in three times in three different Adam Sandler movies

255
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:29,820
But anyways, I need to what was I doing something important E and then clean up the random pea puddles

256
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:45,250
The whole point of this venture is you have no friends. Yeah, but I'm I'll be all right. I'm working on it

257
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:50,679
Okay, get the pea out of the yard and then because look look at the room. Look at it

258
00:35:50,679 --> 00:36:01,630
It's definitely because of all this piss in random places. I guarantee it. Look at that. Did that fix it?

259
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:18,460
All right, stop eating chips and just get out there. Why is it suck still what why it's zero

260
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:34,440
What is bringing this so far town it's the newspapers. Oh my god all this fucking mail

261
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,280
All right, you know something I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you a real big hot take here

262
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
You ready for a real hot take? This is a real one

263
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,610
We have we like all talk about how much we care about the environment, right?

264
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:52,619
I do like I obviously want this planet to stick around for a long time. Everybody talks about this, right?

265
00:36:52,739 --> 00:37:01,659
Yep, we still allow fucking whole magazines that you never ordered that you don't want that they somehow

266
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:08,530
Just sent to you for no fucking reason millions of pieces of just paper sent to everybody

267
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:14,699
But we don't we somehow don't want to get rid what I want to stop doing that when I go to my mailbox

268
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:20,130
It's been like this since I was 15 didn't matter where I was where I lived what state what city didn't matter

269
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:29,320
There was always like thick thick magazines that the household did not order that were just fucking sent to random houses

270
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,800
And they were thick real magazines big big chunky newspapers

271
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,940
Like what the fuck are we doing this for why do we still do this?

272
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:47,940
I think that's it. I think that's a huge problem. The whole the whole mail system is so fucked up. Like why do we have?

273
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,940
Oh, yeah, we'll just just blow out

274
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,500
like

275
00:37:52,500 --> 00:38:02,000
28,000 magazines to everybody in the city and they're gonna throw them away not one single person reads those hand to God

276
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,179
I'm sitting here telling you hand to God. I have never opened one of those ever

277
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,460
I just go that's a fucking lot of like waste and then I throw it in the recycling they no one opens them

278
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:23,349
No one no one opens them. Why do they do this? Stop doing this?

279
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:28,510
Sometimes I'll even go to my mailbox and it's stuffed full of bullshit that I didn't even order

280
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:38,300
It's like what the fuck is all this and this one piece of mail. That's like a bank statement. It's to the same cat here

281
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,909
Oh shit, they're fighting for dominance and who's the real one is

282
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:54,619
Shit boots is boots is territory. That was rant Andy. No, that's fucking stupid. I'm sorry. That's really dumb

283
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:02,019
We talk all this shit about the environment and how much we care about it

284
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:06,980
But then like those companies that these same companies will just mass mail the shit out to you

285
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:29,059
Recycling Andy. I don't want all your bullshit. I don't want all your stupid mail that I'm not gonna read

286
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:41,630
it's like if I was walking down the sidewalk and

287
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:46,539
You stopped me and you said excuse me, excuse me

288

292
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,639
Okay, listen, do I have to say this to you to your face?

293
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:18,590
It's really cool that you have a piano recital, I'm not going and I'm never going I will never go

294
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,079
Please stop stopping me on the sidewalk and asking me if I want to go to the piano recital

295
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:25,840
I will never go. Is this what you need me to do? Do you need me?

296
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,980
Do you need to hear me say this? Okay. All right, right my god

297
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:36,659
That's fine. Then you don't have to go my goodness. Have a good day, sir. Yeah. Have a good day a week later

298
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:42,239
I go to the fucking sidewalk and this motherfuckers is there again. Hey, sir, you want to go to the piano recital?

299
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:55,260
When what what I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking freak out. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Like why can't you just leave me alone?

300
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:02,760
Oh, by the way at the end of the piano recital, we're gonna give a coupon book to everybody that's there

301
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:27,820
I don't want you fucking coupon book. Stop sending me coupon books. Oh shit. My sim is dying. No, I'm sorry

302
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,219
I'm sick of that shit

303
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:33,619
It's been something that's been on my mind for a long time and I think it's on everybody's mind and wait

304
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,619
Don't you step in the food you idiot?

305
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:43,760
That's one of those things that you'd always think about but you never was. Oh, yeah

306
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,099
That's I guess that we do have people to do that

307
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:55,460
They need to transition completely and to just spam like emails and I'll tell you why because like nobody opens those either

308
00:41:55,699 --> 00:42:07,340
But at least those aren't clogging up your mailbox and like burning down trees if I had to pick one of the two evils

309
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:16,289
I'd pick that one

310
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:20,730
How about this? How about you just don't be a fucking asshole like and just send people random shit

311
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:25,449
They don't want like when did that become something that oh, yeah. Well, whatever just said just just like fucking annoying everybody

312
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:32,409
We live in like we we live in a society of just annoyance

313
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:36,550
Everybody just wants to annoy each other. What?

314
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,780
Why can't you just leave each other the fuck alone?

315
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,800
society

316
00:42:50,800 --> 00:43:00,409
Yeah, I said it. Oh, yeah. He's the oh, he's the Joker. We already went over this. No, I'm not

317
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:08,400
Everybody who says they're the Riddler is actually the Joker and everybody that says they're the Joker is actually the penguin

318
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:25,739
Don't say that about me because I mean that makes me the penguin. I still need to get a job

319
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:29,650
No, he's not gonna want to do that. All right, hunger. Let's go for it

320
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:33,360
Tldr of that conversation is

321
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,989
What the fuck? Why is it? Why?

322
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:42,429
Not know don't even get into it again. Just like what the fuck leave me alone, right? That's all we need to say

323
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:59,280
Tldr society he's got angst angst Andy. That's not even angst. What is it angst?

324
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:26,239
No, you will come to the piano resettled. No, I won't no I won't I ain't going ever you will get the coupon book

325
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:40,480
No, I won't what if you would really enjoy it, but okay

326
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,380
Are we going to base like our society around like you're you're like?

327
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:49,949
Kind of friend that doesn't stop asking you to watch a certain movie or TV show

328
00:44:50,230 --> 00:45:01,909
You know, I mean like as I was that the excuse you're giving telling you you really you really you have to watch it

329
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:09,110
It's so good. Watch it. I don't want to watch it. No, you would love it. Watch it tomorrow. I don't want to

330
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:12,349
Maybe I would I don't want to right now

331
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:22,909
And I don't want to be like forced to and then when you're watching the movie the friend is that kind of staring at you

332
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:24,989
Like waiting to see what you're gonna say about certain scenes

333
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:36,019
It's like can we watch this in different rooms and like and every 30 to 40 minutes take a pee break and I'll tell you

334
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:52,559
What I think

335
00:45:52,559 --> 00:46:03,880
And then they give you a coupon book. This is never good. I'm good. Okay, no more no more like oh

336
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:10,460
Here goes. He's ranting. There's no more ranting. He's gonna start ramping. No more of this

337
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:20,920
I'm gonna play the game now. Your sim is dying. My sim is in good health. It just doesn't have any friends

338
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:40,289
I'm trying to change that. Let's just throw it. No. All right call over a neighbor or something

339
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:53,650
I can't get a job unless I have like my social height. You need so much social because you're so outgoing

340
00:46:53,650 --> 00:47:03,030
I don't even know. I don't even care who they are. Just bring them over. Mo

341
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:15,480
I'm just gonna throw a party throw a party and I'm gonna have something to do. There's a pool outside

342
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:28,449
Let's have like a dance party group activity hit this one here. This is fine. Put it on top of the TV

343
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:30,750
Why not? It'll be it'll give it like eyes. It'll be funny

344
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,619
Because I'm having a party I need to move stuff

345
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:57,739
You drag the couch across the room and then make it so people gonna just hang out this thing's dead

346
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:22,760
All right, so that's good. Let's move this so I can have a big dance floor. I need a little table

347
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:31,360
Oh, this is good group activity, right? No, I don't care. Whatever fuck it

348
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,000
This sucks

349
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,559
This would be such a bad party

350
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,519
It's like you have to drag your TV and your couch out of the way and this is a huge speaker

351
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,119
It would sound awful in here throw a party

352
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:44,519
Here we go

353
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:55,719
If I need to throw a party and have everybody have a dance party here to have my soul should go up even 1%

354
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:21,119
Sounds great. This looks like Jesse's house from Breaking Bad. Yeah, it does. I turn the cartoons off. They're coming. Don't worry

355
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:36,280
I promise they're coming over right now. Welcome. Welcome everybody. Hello. Come on in

356
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:45,199

359
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,369

00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:39,550
Gotta save this guy. I gotta save this guy. He keeps doing the sock puppet to this dude

361
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:45,469
They're in an awkward conversation outside the house because I haven't let them in and now this guy's just doing the sock puppet over and over

362
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,389
I have to be freaking this guy out

363
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:51,880

No, it turns out the game was not fun and not funny and all the time

372
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,469
I took to get it set up was not worth it because everybody hates it

373
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,159

Ridiculous this guy won't leave this guy alone. Oh

00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:35,519
No, he's realizing the only reason why I threw this party was to get him to come over. Oh

380
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,739
Shit, I fell for the bait. Oh

381
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:50,239

Oh my god, there's no chair move out of the way

426
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,480
I'm running out of money fast. Whatever this is. I have to take it

427
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:08,989
It doesn't matter what it is. I have to take a job. Whatever it is culinary

428
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,280

432
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:17,280
I only have like three more in sim days or like two more of a week

433
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:45,920
Maybe one of the plants be a clown if I could I would do it. What time is it? It's okay

01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,000
It's 10 p.m. I'm gonna go for

435
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,989

437
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,159
Use a job

438
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:21,960
And then go to bed

439
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:29,760
Social is low again. I really should have had outgoing at zero. That's the difficulty slider in The Sims 1 is

440
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:41,599
Your outgoing meter. Was I gonna talk to a talent agent?

441
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,559
I was gonna talk to a talent agent, but my character is having problems existing

442
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,360
You can social drop so quickly

443
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,599
And nobody talks to me and I throw a party to get someone to talk to me and then it decays in a day

444

02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:08,609

You brought home 150 and got a 300 bonus. All right. Now, what do I need?

779
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:24,050

786
02:14:04,289 --> 02:14:09,010

Oh, yeah, how much is that 68 bucks? It's a nice big beautiful a big beautiful window right there

788
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:36,470
Okay, now I need a table this room's not big enough for this

789
02:14:37,510 --> 02:15:04,369
Too big. That's all right. This is not this is a desk. What do you mean a desk efficiency table?

790
02:15:04,449 --> 02:15:14,899

791
02:15:18,069 --> 02:15:19,859
It's not

792
02:15:19,859 --> 02:15:21,859
How would you mean the windows backwards?

793
02:15:23,109 --> 02:15:26,050
It's not backwards

794
02:15:26,130 --> 02:15:27,329
It is

795
02:15:27,329 --> 02:15:30,439
No, it's not these open

796
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:53,489
How is it backwards don't those close and open the shutters are in the end. Yeah, isn't that that's how it works

797
02:15:53,489 --> 02:16:04,640
Right, you know what a window looks like those are storm windows. What do you mean? What the fuck?

798
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:21,720
I thought those don't those clothes. Hold on. Give me the hand tool. You guys are fucking crazy. What are you talking about?

799
02:16:22,659 --> 02:16:26,920
What are you talking about? They go out. No, they don't

800
02:16:35,889 --> 02:16:41,860
Shutters go outside. I've never had a house with shutters. I'm so I don't

801
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:45,459
I've never seen that before. I thought it was a big like bay window

802
02:16:45,780 --> 02:17:02,260
I've I've don't even know what that is shutters. I don't i've never had shutters before that's good

803
02:17:02,659 --> 02:17:09,030
Wait, I want to move it a little bit. That's better. All right

804
02:17:09,590 --> 02:17:21,250
Okay, I need this is too cluttered in here. How do I make this better?

805
02:17:21,649 --> 02:17:28,690
This kind of needs to go like on the patio or something. This is gonna make the room bad

806
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:49,909
Make the house bigger. I could how much is that gonna cost?

807
02:18:06,049 --> 02:19:07,299
I'm just moving the computer's going over here. I'm just gonna it's like playing a puzzle game. Okay, that's better brass

808
02:19:07,379 --> 02:19:14,979
I don't i've done one thing at a time. What color is this one?

809
02:19:20,069 --> 02:19:36,850
Shit, I don't even know what color that is. It's like a light blue. Okay, leave the grass

810
02:19:37,329 --> 02:19:46,600
Oh, I don't leave the grass. All right. This is this blue carpet kind of dark blue

811
02:19:51,719 --> 02:19:53,719
All right, that's better much better

812
02:19:53,959 --> 02:20:02,100
In fact, let's move that over in the corner and then I can put the plant in here

813
02:20:02,879 --> 02:20:13,829
Oh, that's so much nicer. This gives more room to move stuff around here

814
02:20:14,389 --> 02:20:27,280
Now I need some chairs

815
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:29,350
Look how much better that is

816
02:20:29,350 --> 02:20:31,350
I just need some regular chairs

817
02:20:32,319 --> 02:20:34,579
Two not more than two

818
02:20:34,579 --> 02:20:48,520
I'm running out of money. They have to be just default shitty chairs. Okay, i'm out of money. I have a roof

819
02:20:48,520 --> 02:21:12,049
Look, i'll prove it didn't have a roof. All right. I'm good. My house is now actually not a total disaster

820
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:18,680
If I can move around in this though, what's this? It's a new table. Go check it out

821
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:37,959
I don't think he likes this out here. Oh, shut up the table. What is not to like about this?

822
02:21:37,959 --> 02:21:43,649
I don't understand what is not to like about this table. It's just a piece of wood

823
02:21:43,649 --> 02:21:58,579
It's a place to eat move this too. Can I get into bed or is this in the way?

824
02:22:18,629 --> 02:22:28,100
Um, that's all right. That's fine here. The pc looks slow

825
02:22:29,379 --> 02:22:54,420
Whatever. I think I need to get rid of this. Oh perfect. Let's go on the ground ain't the outside

826
02:22:56,559 --> 02:23:03,829
Oh shit, you're right. What is it? It's this uh,

827
02:23:05,159 --> 02:23:06,840
this like

828
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:30,389
Strip of black on the top and bottom this one here. All right, how's that better? Get yourself a pet, please

829
02:23:30,709 --> 02:23:34,610
I need to get promoted twice so I can make enough money to afford a pet

830
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:45,030
I will trust me. I'm going for it turn the lawn into a carpet. I feel like that would look really not good

831
02:23:46,309 --> 02:24:00,950
Again, I think he'd hate that. This is a good setup so far. It's a good setup. I like it

832
02:24:04,879 --> 02:24:12,440
Go outside and touch the grass

833
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:21,760
I go touch it go put my hands on it you wear speedos around your house

834
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,760
That's why you never have a face cam on

835
02:24:24,079 --> 02:24:28,559
Um, I mean I wear pajama pants

836
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:42,500
I throw on pajama pants and I hang out and I just chill out in my house. That's the doom character's head

837
02:24:47,319 --> 02:24:50,040
It kind of is. Yeah, that actually is the doom guy

848
02:25:59,799 --> 02:26:05,489
I wonder will she sit down and start eating it. I wonder if she actually sits to eat this. Um

Everybody thought I was gonna be in the game

But it just turned out to be a fucking lie

926
02:38:10,709 --> 02:38:13,350
I was really hoping that peter griffin was gonna come over

927
02:38:14,069 --> 02:38:16,069
I was calling mega over and over again

928
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:18,950
To try to get her to bring the family over

929
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:20,950

02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:33,280

931
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:35,200
Why is she naked?

932
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:38,610

02:39:52,440 --> 02:40:08,129
Well peter our new friend is here. This is a weird self insert. Somebody said

944
02:40:08,530 --> 02:40:18,770
Like i'm just i'm writing my own fan fiction of my own universe

945
02:40:23,809 --> 02:40:28,049
You know what? I didn't know about the griffin household until looking at

946
02:40:28,690 --> 02:40:30,690
Um, like what their house looked like?

947
02:40:31,639 --> 02:40:33,639
They have like a second living room

948
02:40:33,719 --> 02:40:36,520
I thought the piano was in this room

949
02:40:37,319 --> 02:40:39,319
They have a huge fucking house

950
02:40:42,389 --> 02:40:44,389
If you've got two full couches in your house

951
02:40:45,190 --> 02:40:46,950
That's a good indication that

952
02:40:46,950 --> 02:40:48,950
You you you might have a little bit of money

953
02:40:59,459 --> 02:41:01,059
You made the house

954
02:41:01,059 --> 02:41:04,659
Yeah, i'm saying I do like I didn't know until researching

955
02:41:05,299 --> 02:41:07,700
That this is what the griffins has like a second living room

956
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:14,420
Do not home wreck the griffins

957
02:41:17,959 --> 02:41:22,469
All right. Let's let's have peter do something here comes the episode. All right

958
02:41:23,409 --> 02:41:24,850

02:41:24,850 --> 02:41:27,409
Oh peter's gonna serve dinner

02:41:35,079 --> 02:41:36,760

02:41:53,879 --> 02:41:56,920
I'm sorry. I had to do it. I had to do it. It had to be horrible

964
02:41:57,639 --> 02:42:05,239
All right peter. What do you got?

965
02:42:05,239 --> 02:42:06,920

966
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:12,719

967
02:42:12,719 --> 02:42:14,959
No fire. No fire. It didn't work

968
02:42:17,959 --> 02:42:19,959
Why is it so much trash?

969
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:22,340
There's trash everywhere

970
02:42:22,579 --> 02:42:25,590
There's a turkey

971
02:42:25,750 --> 02:42:38,799
Dirty turkey

972
02:42:38,799 --> 02:42:40,520

973
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:42,040
There I am right there

974
02:42:42,040 --> 02:42:45,190
Wait, why?

975
02:42:45,190 --> 02:42:47,190
It's a stupid character

976
02:42:47,430 --> 02:42:52,799
This is just a reference of this is peter in a suit

977
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:57,250
Hey lois, remember the time when I pretended to be a raccoon and eat out of the trash

978
02:43:07,649 --> 02:43:28,870
Why they're all freaking out actual family guy routine. Yeah. Oh shit. Sorry. That was like

979
02:43:28,950 --> 02:43:35,329
I remember when I was a hamster every that time when I was a hamster. Fuck. I had that it should have been that

980
02:43:43,239 --> 02:43:48,579
Where did I leave?

981
02:43:48,579 --> 02:43:50,659
No, here I am right here. What's gonna happen in the room?

982
02:43:51,719 --> 02:44:01,079
We're all trying to use the same bathroom. We like give me stuff

983
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:15,120
Now it's self-insert fan fiction now. Now. That's what this is

984
02:44:16,069 --> 02:45:00,930
Wasn't that before until right now? Come on. Does this make my social go up too?

985
02:45:01,809 --> 02:45:06,000
Oh my god. Look me me and lois get along so well

986
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:09,440

991
02:46:28,579 --> 02:46:34,200
Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. What? Oh, I remember that song that our family sings

992
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:37,239
It seems today that all you see

993
02:46:37,959 --> 02:46:40,120
Is violence in movies and sex on tv

994
02:46:41,350 --> 02:46:43,350
But where are those good old fashion values?

995
02:46:43,670 --> 02:46:47,159
On which we used to rely and lucky there's a family guy

996
02:46:48,549 --> 02:46:50,719
Family guy lucky. There's a bad

She's going now to sleep in the bed that stewie is in that is really cute. Where can she sleep?

1012
02:49:43,750 --> 02:49:54,950
Don't have a couch. Holy shit. This place is a disaster. All right, that was fun

1013
02:49:55,510 --> 02:49:57,510

Okay, i'm almost at 100

03:13:05,479 --> 03:13:14,500
At least we can sit and have a conversation

1153
03:13:14,739 --> 03:13:17,959
You need to invite peter over and kill him. I don't need to do that yet

1154
03:13:18,760 --> 03:13:24,200
And I know I just said yet, but you know what I mean

You've been promoted to stunt double

1179
03:19:53,159 --> 03:19:58,040
That's not the box office megastar being set on fire and tossed from a helicopter. That's you

1180
03:19:59,139 --> 03:20:01,639
You're making a name for yourself

1181
03:20:01,639 --> 03:20:05,399
Though and directors like your novel ideas for mock mayhem

1182
03:20:05,879 --> 03:20:07,239
Keep those creative juices flowing

1183
03:20:07,239 --> 03:20:13,399
You just might graduate to a low budget starring role of your own if you survive keep yourself and your gear in top shape

1184
03:20:13,879 --> 03:20:16,389
But you may miss that airbag

1185

1196
03:22:35,260 --> 03:22:37,260
My whole meal while she's outside

1197
03:22:39,370 --> 03:22:41,209
What the fuck are you doing?

1198
03:22:41,209 --> 03:22:54,709
I don't what why did that happen? That doesn't make any sense

1199
03:22:54,870 --> 03:22:58,149
Why would I sit down and eat my entire meal and I couldn't cancel it

1200
03:22:58,309 --> 03:23:21,190
But can you want to come over again? Sure. This place is dullsville. I'll have i'm gonna be at your place

03:23:21,270 --> 03:23:44,969
All right, so clean this up. Here we go. Good to see you again. You're standing in the flower bed. That's not really good

1202
03:23:45,930 --> 03:24:21,979
Okay, how are you pulling the puppet out immediately? Where's flirt? Why is it not here dog is growling?

1204
03:25:01,979 --> 03:25:31,290
How do I make this bar go up? Oh, yeah, I have some dinner shit. I don't have energy

1205
03:25:46,569 --> 03:25:49,129
Why is flirt not here?

1206
03:25:51,530 --> 03:25:54,809
I'm at 100. Should I go should I try should I see if she like

1207
03:26:10,440 --> 03:26:19,219
I

1208
03:26:19,219 --> 03:26:21,219
Don't flush the toilet

1209
03:26:21,299 --> 03:26:27,159
I don't think i'm gonna be able to sing victory royale

1210
03:26:27,719 --> 03:26:30,600
While I woohoo lois, I don't think I can do that

1211
03:26:48,100 --> 03:26:50,100
How good how do I get the bar up below it

1212
03:26:52,709 --> 03:26:57,350
Your lifetime relationship changes slowly and shows how long-term trends remember

1213
03:26:57,989 --> 03:27:01,479
So how come this isn't going up? I think that's the problem

1214
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:16,059
It has to be slowly. All right. All right. Fine. All right. Goodbye

1215
03:27:36,729 --> 03:27:38,729
You've only hung out twice

1216
03:27:39,620 --> 03:27:41,620
Oh one

1217
03:27:50,309 --> 03:27:52,620
Ladder peter

1218
03:27:53,659 --> 03:27:56,000
I don't even think her and peter are in a relationship

1219
03:28:06,360 --> 03:28:10,440
Laterum, so do I invite peter over in latterum? Is that what you're saying?

1220
03:28:10,840 --> 03:28:26,940
So stupid. I gotta go to work at the bed

1221
03:28:27,500 --> 03:28:39,510
You didn't meet him. I'll just go to the griffin house and i'll play as peter

1222
03:28:40,069 --> 03:29:11,239
Whatever. Okay, i'm gonna go play i'm gonna go play as peter. Is that cheating?

Stop denying her. What am I what the fuck is this game doing? I just denied her twice

1421
04:06:27,590 --> 04:06:34,149
Holy shit

1422
04:06:34,149 --> 04:06:36,629
What are these dumb games? We are both playing

1423
04:06:37,190 --> 04:06:43,979
Okay, I could flirt that one time

1424
04:06:48,040 --> 04:07:03,719
What the fuck where did it go? I just had flirt. I just flirted and now I can't flirt again

1425
04:07:35,799 --> 04:07:40,159
It's never worked it's always gone wrong

1426
04:07:40,700 --> 04:07:42,700
It's never has never worked

1427
04:07:43,260 --> 04:07:44,299
once

1428
04:07:44,299 --> 04:08:03,059
Why is it even a clickable option? It's never it's nobody ever wants that she fucking combo

1429
04:08:07,129 --> 04:08:09,129
She combo breakered you

1430
04:08:11,450 --> 04:08:29,319
She's leaving. Okay, does he know that he's already friend-zoned and cannot have a romance. What do you mean?

1431
04:08:29,399 --> 04:08:37,239
What are you talking about?

1432
04:08:37,239 --> 04:08:42,600
She tried to intimately hug me twice and I was like get off get away from me get away from me

1433
04:08:43,459 --> 04:08:46,180
And then I went to go into you know what I mean? Like why am I doing that?

1434
04:08:46,180 --> 04:08:53,899
I just tried to initiate

1435
04:08:53,899 --> 04:08:57,979
You're incompatible

1436
04:08:57,979 --> 04:08:59,819
They say we're incompatible

1437
04:08:59,819 --> 04:09:02,229
We'll show them

1438
04:09:02,229 --> 04:09:16,010
I feel like every fucking song you've ever heard it's about like how we're incompatible but we're gonna it

1439
04:09:16,489 --> 04:09:21,020
How it doesn't you know, it doesn't matter. It's like every single fucking love song i've ever heard in my life

1440
04:09:21,420 --> 04:09:30,120
I think it's some of the most famous love songs you've ever heard for instance

1441
04:09:38,489 --> 04:09:39,770
That's a famous one

1442
04:09:39,850 --> 04:09:50,819
Remember that infomercial that came on every day with the love songs

1443
04:09:51,299 --> 04:09:56,250
I was like i've looked forward to that part every time it came on

1444
04:09:59,190 --> 04:10:10,540
If you know, you know, and I don't I don't have to explain that don't you only listen to video game music

1446
04:10:32,569 --> 04:10:36,360
No, I gotta get like one of the mario brothers to invite me over their house

1447
04:10:36,600 --> 04:10:48,680
If you spam the same interaction to lower the success chances time do different things

1448
04:10:49,079 --> 04:10:53,739
Well, I only have three options kiss hug or talk about interests

1449
04:10:53,819 --> 04:10:59,979

1769
04:59:16,979 --> 04:59:20,090
That's by the way in the corners of the map

1770
04:59:21,189 --> 04:59:24,700
This pet's expansion that they did was terrible

1771
04:59:26,150 --> 04:59:28,150
Like why do I have to take care of this?

1772

Is the sims 4 is viva piñata and the sims 1 is dark souls with a blindfold on

1817
05:05:22,919 --> 05:05:24,919

It doesn't doesn't with the maid no, that's I can't

1823
05:06:24,119 --> 05:06:42,459
Let's just go in the pool. I'm at 68 though. I was at like 100 game is broken. No, it's not

1824
05:06:44,000 --> 05:06:46,000
You need more long-term points

1825
05:06:46,400 --> 05:06:50,240
How many days have to go by for this to go up?

1826
05:06:54,729 --> 05:06:57,290
I feel like this has been over 40 or 50 for like a week

1827
05:06:58,009 --> 05:06:59,130
Two weeks

1828
05:06:59,130 --> 05:07:05,340
It takes multiple months for this to go up

1829
05:07:17,599 --> 05:07:30,430
You need the daily relationship to be over seven 70. Okay top bar is daily in lifetime bar

1830
05:07:30,509 --> 05:07:32,990
So the top bar has to be over 70 the bottom bar has to be over what?

1831
05:07:38,029 --> 05:07:41,709
Real lifetime is the bottom bar in game time is the top bar

1832
05:07:47,130 --> 05:07:52,319
70 is to get a crush

1833
05:07:52,319 --> 05:07:58,319
Really? I actually I need I need to make money somehow

1834
05:08:02,779 --> 05:08:07,049
Have one of them move in. I don't think I can do that

1835
05:08:10,750 --> 05:08:12,830
70 on the bottom bar is love

1836
05:08:14,490 --> 05:08:16,840
Oh, okay

1837
05:08:16,840 --> 05:08:18,360
What you're saying is

1838
05:08:18,360 --> 05:08:19,799

05:08:19,799 --> 05:08:21,869

06:06:33,020 --> 06:06:34,299

Now, this is not a victory royale. I don't there's no heart next to her name

2171
06:07:47,220 --> 06:07:53,549
Light kiss does not equate to the romance. All right, this is it

Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. If I can play fortnight for like five minutes passionate kiss, let's go

2256
06:25:05,650 --> 06:25:14,900

06:25:30,700 --> 06:25:32,700

That's that's great. Um, I don't I don't think it's possible

2265
06:26:55,889 --> 06:26:58,930
I think it's impossible to like have a relationship in the sims one

2266
06:26:59,330 --> 06:27:03,090
Unless you for like unless you like make them in the same household to make them married already

2267
06:27:05,090 --> 06:27:09,009
Like by the first part of the game, can you even do that? Can you make people even married in the first game?

You want some to eat let's have some food grab a plate have some it's good right i'm jumping the gun

2282
06:31:01,979 --> 06:31:03,979
Okay

2283
06:31:16,099 --> 06:31:18,529
This is it

2284
06:31:56,580 --> 06:31:58,580
This game is stupid

2285
06:31:58,659 --> 06:32:02,270
This game is stupid

2286
06:32:02,270 --> 06:32:06,990
She literally tried to passionately romantically kiss me 24 hours ago

2287
06:32:07,229 --> 06:32:10,270
And then if I initiated it's wait, it's not gonna happen

2288
06:32:12,880 --> 06:32:19,659
This is stupid

2289
06:32:26,930 --> 06:32:28,930
This game is impossible

2290
06:32:31,259 --> 06:32:45,020
I actually think the sims 1 might be impossible back on the computer

2291
06:32:52,880 --> 06:32:58,000
Every every thread I read about this game is like holy shit. It's impossible

2292
06:32:58,080 --> 06:33:00,900
This game's not possible. It's impossible

2293
06:33:01,759 --> 06:33:09,069
This is an end this incompletable video game

2294
06:33:09,630 --> 06:33:24,580
Do we just throw dice in the air for every encounter? This is a poopoo fucking diarrhea poopoo game

2295
06:33:38,380 --> 06:33:40,380
I'm sorry. That was fucking stupid

2296
06:33:46,180 --> 06:34:06,779
Am I gonna really go play the guitar

2297
06:34:40,939 --> 06:34:43,250
Can't even do this anymore

2298
06:34:43,250 --> 06:34:44,770
This is stupid

2299
06:34:44,770 --> 06:35:00,610
You have to have at least 80 in the relationship. No, that's not even real. That's not that's not even accurate

2300
06:35:00,770 --> 06:35:17,229
I thought that was the one when she went to kiss me. I thought that was it. It's not it's not I have no idea. I

2301
06:35:18,830 --> 06:35:30,299
I'm gonna fucking melt down here in a minute here. We characters too short

2302
06:35:30,299 --> 06:35:33,419
They have to be at least six or ban that person for like 45 minutes at least

2303
06:35:33,740 --> 06:35:36,880
I want that person banned for at least 10 minutes

2304
06:35:40,959 --> 06:35:45,759
Okay, I guess we're gonna I'm just gonna go to i'm just gonna fucking go to um, no more swearing

2305
06:35:46,000 --> 06:36:04,020
Jeremy you were having fun playing just calm down. Well, I hit the relationship and by the way

2306
06:36:04,500 --> 06:36:06,189
Here's another thing about this game

2307
06:36:06,189 --> 06:36:16,819
I'm expected to have like five of these seven of these I can't even keep one person interested let alone 10

2308
06:36:17,299 --> 06:36:24,060
Are you kidding me and go to work every day with no breaks?

2309
06:36:31,490 --> 06:36:34,500
You have to make sure they're both in a good mood

2310
06:36:34,500 --> 06:36:47,840
I can't see the mood bar for peach you had more fun killing the whole family. I'm gonna piss the bed. Oh shit

2311
06:36:48,400 --> 06:37:17,090
I'm not even friends with her anymore. What the fuck i'm gonna go

2312
06:37:17,090 --> 06:37:22,560
I'm gonna give it one more real attempt before I take off the nostalgic glasses

2313
06:37:23,040 --> 06:37:29,759
And never play this shitty game ever again. You know what I mean? I'm giving it one more solid attempt

2314
06:37:41,009 --> 06:37:48,319
The bet was for lois. Oh, but no, that doesn't matter. All you care about is the fortnight song anyways

2315
06:37:48,799 --> 06:38:09,119
Does that matter? No, it doesn't matter the guitar down

2316

2701
07:55:47,200 --> 07:55:51,360
Some I think whoever owned this house is dead. Was that the lady that burnt?

2702
07:55:52,220 --> 07:55:54,220
14 hours ago in game

2703
07:55:59,060 --> 07:56:01,060
That had to have been the person that died

2704
07:56:01,459 --> 07:56:06,529
Looks like they're doing and that's why they keep coming to my house

2705
07:56:07,619 --> 07:56:09,060

2711
07:56:41,729 --> 07:57:21,889
I'm kind of curious about this slow down. What the fuck what I have control of the cat

2712
07:57:22,049 --> 07:57:47,330
How do they eat that there used to be a lady here? These are the cats that kept showing up

2713
07:57:47,650 --> 07:57:50,770
Remember boots boots would show up every day

2714
07:57:52,130 --> 07:58:06,959
She burned to death. Okay, that's it. I'll see you later. I'll see you next week. You'll find her urn

2715
07:58:07,540 --> 07:58:15,729
I think I sold it. I threw it away. Uh, that's probably the longest stream i've done in a while

2716
07:58:18,319 --> 07:58:20,549
I feel okay. I do

2717
07:58:20,549 --> 07:58:24,000
I was able to get up a couple of times

2718
07:58:24,000 --> 07:58:25,279
and uh

2719
07:58:25,279 --> 07:58:27,279
doing some new

2720
07:58:27,360 --> 07:58:28,560
treatments

2721
07:58:28,560 --> 07:58:29,889
so

2722
07:58:29,889 --> 07:58:35,409
Where I kind of have been each time you don't see me for like six days in a row. Um,

2723
07:58:35,970 --> 07:58:41,270
Let's see how it goes. I'm gonna keep going. The schedule is good for me. I'll see you guys on saturday next week

2724
07:58:43,750 --> 07:58:45,669
This has been the sims 1 probably not gonna play it again

2725
07:58:45,669 --> 07:58:51,240
If i'm gonna play i'm gonna play the sims 2 a much far better game far better experience from what i've been told

2726
07:58:53,119 --> 07:58:57,119
All jokes aside. I do. Uh, this is a classic video game. It's very very fun. Yeah, although it's

2727
07:58:57,979 --> 07:59:03,490
Painfully difficult. Let's do the sims 2 at some point in the future

2728
07:59:06,279 --> 07:59:09,959
Uh, yeah, that was a long one. I was not expecting. I mean, I was just having fun. That's the point right?

2729
07:59:12,819 --> 07:59:20,610
Just save it just in case and that's that i'll see you guys on saturday of the coming week

2730
07:59:20,610 --> 07:59:25,330
Have a great rest of your weekend. Although it is almost over for a lot of you a good week

2731
07:59:25,490 --> 07:59:37,439
Let's get the credits on here frozen. No

2732
07:59:41,009 --> 07:59:47,799
Uh, my chest and stomach hurts from just laughing at all that stuff and just freaking out

2733
07:59:47,799 --> 07:59:52,450
Is this a meltdown stream? I don't know does it does that qualify as a meltdown it may have some of it may have

2734
07:59:53,090 --> 07:59:54,610
I think a little bit was

2735
07:59:54,610 --> 08:00:05,860
Hey, we got what we wanted got to see the thing we wanted to see i'm happy about it. I missed uh

2736
08:00:06,419 --> 08:00:09,750
Ella dill gave 10 community subs during some of that nonsense

2737
08:00:11,430 --> 08:00:19,270
Roller crunch gave five vessel wind field gave five. Thanks a lot for those community subs

2738
08:00:23,299 --> 08:00:25,540
Every eight hour stream is a meltdown stream

2739
08:00:30,259 --> 08:00:39,319
You know, that's probably somewhat correct. You're probably right. You did not have sex with lois

2740
08:00:40,819 --> 08:00:43,540
Well, it was a different it was a different cartoon character. Okay

2741
08:00:49,490 --> 08:00:51,490
It didn't have to be with lois

2742
08:00:52,229 --> 08:01:01,639
It doesn't have to be with lois

2743
08:01:01,720 --> 08:01:03,799
Right. Uh, yeah, let's do a raid. Let's do

2744
08:01:04,360 --> 08:01:05,560
Two

2745
08:01:05,560 --> 08:01:14,479
Who's live and who's playing things right now? We raided joel a week or two ago. Let's go to

2746
08:01:15,439 --> 08:01:36,369
What is he doing dodge the question? What was what question? Um, hold on. Let me

2747
08:01:37,090 --> 08:01:43,799
Put this over here

2748
08:01:43,799 --> 08:01:45,799
I'm gonna i'll dump you guys on italics

2749
08:01:45,799 --> 08:01:47,799
He's playing disco elsium though. So

2750
08:01:48,599 --> 08:01:52,310
he's probably

2751
08:01:52,310 --> 08:01:55,349
And uh, this is by the way, this is like I think the end of the game

2752
08:01:56,479 --> 08:02:01,909
Like italics is at the end of disco elsium. So if you don't want to get spoiled then

2753
08:02:02,549 --> 08:02:03,509
Um

2754
08:02:03,509 --> 08:02:08,560
I would just be aware of that. You may see like the end of disco elsium

2755
08:02:09,200 --> 08:02:12,159
Go say hello

2756
08:02:12,159 --> 08:02:26,180
Keep that in mind that he's playing disco elsium. Let's say hello. So be weary of spoilers

2757
08:02:26,740 --> 08:02:34,520
Good night. I'll see you guys next week. Have a wonderful rest of your evening

2758
08:02:35,159 --> 08:02:37,720
