00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:40,649
Hello everybody. I already have my chat open. Hold on, let me do that. We fix that. That is a useful

2
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:53,689
thing to have open. Welcome to the House Flipper Unofficial Invitational. How you doing? Give me

3
00:00:53,689 --> 00:01:06,730
one second while I do this. There are 10 people here. It's weird to talk in chat and not be in chat.

4
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:31,640
Hold on. Give me one. I didn't even. I gotta tweet it. I gotta tweet it. Give me a second. The House

5
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:40,540
Flipper Unofficial Invitational. No, this is unofficial. This is only my Invitational.

6
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,659
If you're wondering, I asked a bunch of my friends, a couple other streamer colleagues

7
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:52,409
to come into the stream, spend 75 minutes at the same time with the same house,

8
00:01:53,129 --> 00:02:03,980
and see who makes the best house. Graded on five categories. Well, four categories. You guys will

9
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:13,479
get the last grade. Everybody should be getting started with their streams. We want to make sure

10
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:22,300
everyone's ready to go. All right, here we go. Who's here? We will. We will introduce them in

11
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:30,099
just one second. How much time do they get? 75 minutes. Are you playing Final Fantasy today?

12
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:40,009
What? Not today. Yeah, we're gonna play Final Fantasy in five minutes. No.

13
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:52,379
All right, I think we can get the crew here. Let's see if everybody's here. Hello? Is anybody here?

14
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:03,610
Hello, Mr. J. Well, that's a mod. All right. Is everybody here? I'm live right now. So if

15
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:13,719
anybody wants to pop in. Hello. Hi. Yeah, we got, we got mods in here. Everybody unmute.

16
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:22,460
Yeah. Yeah. Hello. How is it going, folks? What's up? Should I ping the other streamers to unmute?

17
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:33,349
I would say so. And it's 75 minutes. Starts right now. Wait, really? No, no, no, no. I'm just

18
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:42,259
kidding. I'm kidding. Oh, that's right. That's right. That's right. All right. Once everybody's

19
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:48,469
here. Yeah, you can unmute. You can undefine everything. We're going to go over it real

20
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:52,550
quickly. And I'm very curious. I want to get a little bit of a temperature check from all of you.

21
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:59,110
We're going to introduce every single person. Each person gets each person gets 15 minutes to

22
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,750
introduce themselves. Should take us about two or three hours to get through the initial intros

23
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:15,289
here. Cool. Glad I have this full PowerPoint presentation. You to me. All right. So welcome,

24
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:22,259
ladies and gentlemen, to the house flipper of unofficial invitational. What you see on

25
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:27,819
my screen right now is the house that all of these streamers are going to have to turn into

26
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:35,579
a beautiful home in 75 minutes. The timer is on my stream. I would be aware that streamers,

27
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:41,259
if you need to know, it's 75 minutes, hour and 15 from when I count down. Well, let's introduce

28
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,459
who's here first. And by the way, you get literally like a five second introduction.

29
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:54,660
So let's start. Whoever wants to go first. Go ahead. Just go. I'm Vinny. Hi. That's all I need.

30
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,459
He got it. Well, I was I thought we were going to hear a shit load of people just start yelling.

31
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,639
Does he get points for that? Does he get graded? Hmm. Yep. I think so.

32
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,100
That was some good philosophy. That was pretty good philosophy. That's right. Everyone's.

33
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,750
No, no. See, see, see dog. What time is it where you are right now?

34
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:24,629
It's well, it's 512 a.m. And I woke up at 430 a.m. For this. So I hope that goes into the kind

35
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:30,600
judging considerations that at an inconvenient time, I'm on peak performance.

36
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:42,019
Yeah. So I'll just go through it. Connery's pants. See dog. Criken. Doug Doug. It's Alex. Ludwig.

37
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:53,699
R.T. game. Joel. I almost just said Trotter, but you're you're a mod and Vinesauce Vinny.

38
00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:00,259
These are your we did an alphabetical order. Yeah. Roll call attendance done for the class.

39
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,779
That's the attendance of ladies and gentlemen. And I mean, you know, for German 98. Yeah.

40
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,189
Whistler. I don't know. He's not here. He might just say he might just show up and just jump in

41
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:19,860
the call later. He has no pressure to be here, by the way. It's a content creator stream and

42
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,500
we're less than 15 minutes late. That is a crowning achievement. That actually is true.

43
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,620
It's true. There's the sheer fact that miracle we're all actually here at the same time is

44
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,740
quite shocking. It is. I'm just going to tell you guys this. When German presented this idea to us

45
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,300
and I'm going to go full in for this, all right, because it's going to be like my part of this

46
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,360
is going to be crap. But I get into this call and I'm expecting everybody's got their stuff lined up

47
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,620
so good. And I realize none of these guys have booted up the game. Yeah. So I have a good chance

48
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,540
of maybe making it into the bottom five. You know, you got this, Joel. I believe in you,

49
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,220
Joel. I don't know. You might be the favorite. It's possible you're the

50
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,980
fellow. I hope you crash and burn. Joel showed us his secret and it is

51
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,620
way better than anything I thought. I think we have a very. I hope you're a lecture about the walls.

52
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,740
So I don't know how to make walls. I will figure that out. He woke up. It's five a.m. He's like,

53
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,300
what the fuck does German want me to do? He wants to build a house. What are the tools?

54
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,939
Telling me about the technique, about how bad he will.

55
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:30,579
You're going to scroll at a good pace. Make sure you're five pixels away from the wall.

56
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:34,500
The ball won't build. And I'm like, wait, which tool is this? Well, I'll figure it out.

57
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,740
Yeah, it's by the way, this whole thing is horseshit. None of this matter.

58
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,290
Give it away. What? No reason to stay.

59
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,370
If you guys just all left right now, like it would be fine. Like there's no nobody wins anything.

60
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,610
Nobody loses anything except I have to ask you, Jerma. I have to ask you this.

61
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,500
This might be a stupid question, but are you wearing it like a toupee or something?

62
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,500
You look like you look like you. No, I'm not wearing a toupee.

63
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,019
Oh, this is my real fucking hair. Tony's shit. What happened?

64
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,420
Look more professional or something. This is Tony. Take points away for that.

65
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,939
Take points for copying Tony star. Thank you for bringing up points.

66
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,779
Let's go over it real quickly. You are all going to be graded individually.

67
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,620
You're going to give me a tour through what you thought?

68
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,189
You don't like my presentation voice? There's a lot of people in here who just left.

69
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,929
Is it a mod? You'll never figure out who it was with like streamer mode on.

70
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,769
OK. Sorry, Jerma. Which sea name was it? Good luck.

71
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,570
You are all going. Let me talk about what you're doing.

72
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,730
Yeah, that's an old one. That one was of 2018.

73
00:08:51,850 --> 00:09:00,070
I mean, this is like a first trial run of this event. You guys supposed to be my friends.

74
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,970
We're listening, buddy. Go ahead.

75
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,690
I'm going to keep you going, Jerma. Yeah, everybody give it up for Jerma.

76
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,769
I'm here for you. Moment of silence for Jerma.

77
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:12,889
You are all going after 75 minutes, which, by the way, everybody here is streaming.

78
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:17,850
So everybody has their streams going. You can jump around, go see what people are doing.

79
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,409
Maybe one of them isn't. And then, you know, whatever, that's all good.

80
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:23,580
Well, maybe two of them aren't three. Doesn't matter. But go check it out.

81
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,659
You're going to be seeing their process. They'll be streaming it live.

82
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,539
They're all on this house and they're all going to be graded on five categories.

83
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:33,419
Creativity is number one. It's worth 35 percent of your total grade.

84
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:36,710
Creativity. Creatively bankrupt.

85
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:44,870
Based on a one hundred point scale, it's worth 35 percent of your total grade.

86
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:50,950
Complexity and structure is your second grade. This is worth 25 percent of your total grade.

87
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,950
How do you how did you handle the walls? What is your interior wall structure looks like?

88
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,669
Did you do any additions? How does your yard look?

89
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:01,429
Did you did you add anything in there? How does your yard look?

90
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:06,409
How does your yard look? The next one is cleanliness.

91
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:11,500
Cleanliness is worth 15. I see that over there. Somebody's put an image of me.

92
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,740
It's worth it. Cleanliness is worth 15 percent of your total grade.

93
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,620
So make sure. Look, I mean, look at this. You got this kind of dirty.

94
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,139
It's kind of fucked up. You're going to be graded on this one hundred point scale.

95
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,779
Maybe you get an F and clean. Maybe you get an A plus in creativity.

96
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,659
Use your time wisely. The next grade.

97
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:33,990
There's more. Philosophy is worth 15 percent of your total grade.

98
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,990
What does philosophy mean? We'll find out because I don't know either.

99
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,059
So we're going to figure that out as we go. The last grade is worth 10 percent.

100
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:48,299
It is chat's grade. The mods are going to put a poll in at the end of each person's individual tour.

101
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:55,750
That will be a very simple A, B, C, D or F. F is always 55 points.

102
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,870
You can't go lower than 55 points. Do we have any questions?

103
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,220
Have you revealed that you are going to build a real full scale replica of the winning house yet?

104
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,519
For the dollhouse, too. This is the location.

105
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,480
No, not yet. But that's that's that's a great idea.

106
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,240
That's actually a fantastic idea.

107
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:19,929
There's like grandmas on the left side of my screen. Is that all right?

108
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,529
OK, it escape. Go to settings. Go to gameplay options and

109
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,889
check the box that says I don't want to hear from the people, the buyers.

110
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,120
You should all do that.

111
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,600
Oh, I. Oh, wait, I think you're joking.

112
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,320
Well, they were just. OK, can I ask how many people?

113
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,720
That is funny, though, in my two page document that I sent you all four or five days ago.

114
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,720
How do you guys think I was making a joke?

115
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:49,129
I read I read it like I did. I read the whole thing.

116
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,610
I thought it was more like light reading, though. I thought I didn't realize it was

117
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,330
optional. I thought it was a creative writing piece.

118
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,350
I said you guys a two page document with detailed instructions.

119
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,509
It seemed like G.B.T. wrote it.

120
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,389
Oh, yeah. I thought it was like an Isaac Asimov, the foundation thing.

121
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,710
Like it didn't actually have any bearing on real life.

122
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,830
I don't understand the power.

123
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,669
We had to eat a horse in preparation.

124
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,190
I ate the horse.

125
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,750
Ladies and gentlemen, I read it so I could figure out all the loopholes.

126
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,320
Are we all ready? Oh, yes.

127
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,440
I didn't catch that.

128
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,570
I'm ready because you have seventy five minutes as of the third.

129
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:35,799
You're making me laugh as of three, two, one, go.

130
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,519
OK, they all muted. They can't hear me anymore.

131
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,799
I can hear you. I heard.

132
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,679
Oh, you're waiting.

133
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,960
That's not how muting works.

134
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,159
What? What happened?

135
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,360
I thought everyone was gone.

136
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,860
Oh, hi. All right.

137
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,940
Well, so they are on their own streams.

138
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,139
I'm very curious what they do.

139
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,659
In the meantime, I'm going to just kind of show you some things about house flipper

140
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,580
that, you know, we're just going to go take a look.

141
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,830
Some of you might not have ever seen this game.

142
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,870
Yeah, you should probably mute me

143
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,029
because I'm just going to be like an annoying presenter this whole time.

144
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,990
Somebody says Ludwig isn't streaming.

145
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,909
So he's cheating.

146
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:22,460
That's so funny.

147
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,899
But anyways, all right, let's go.

148
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,740
So I'm very curious about this.

149
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,659
This was just something to do for fun.

150
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,620
I never thought this was going to be like anything serious or anything.

151
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,960
But this is this is going to be a good time.

152
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,679
I'm very curious.

153
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,919
I could go peek in and see what they're doing, but I'm going to leave that up to you.

154
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,399
I think I think I want because I want to be very

155
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,120
surprised.

156
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,399
I don't think I want to see what they're doing.

157
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,259
I think I want to be given a fully completely secret tour

158
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,700
because then I can get my real assessment on the grades

159
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,460
because we have them here and I'm ready to give them to each individual person.

160
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:01,909
So let me let me do some stuff.

161
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:02,789
Let me let me see what I can do.

162
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,230
And I don't who cares about my time.

163
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,100
What the fuck do I care?

164
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,980
I don't want to peek.

165
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,620
So let's see.

166
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,659
What do I want to do?

167
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,190
I can just clean the yard and just hang out.

168
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,409
All right.

169
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:19,929
What I do want to I do want to ask this question of everybody that's streaming right now.

170
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:24,600
Who is panicking the most right now?

171
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,480
Right now, out of all the people that are doing this, who right now is like,

172
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,919
I don't fucking know what's going on.

173
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,490
Please somebody help me.

174
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,970
I bet you it's all of them because they have to clean.

175
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,450
Look at how fucking like dirty the yard is.

176
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,370
Hey, don't don't tell them this.

177
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,429
I'm going to want to see back here, too.

178
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,990
Don't tell them that.

179
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,460
Well, you think that's worth a 100 percent?

180
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,340
You think that's with an A plus?

181
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:59,080
If you miss anything here, they're stream sniping each other.

182
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,830
They really they really shouldn't be.

183
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,340
But whatever, it doesn't fucking matter.

184
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,960
I'm so curious, though.

185
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,320
I wonder what they all do.

186
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,259
They're stealing ideas from each other.

187
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:22,740
It's so funny.

188
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,879
I try to give the there's so many.

189
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,519
It's so funny.

190
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,480
So I had like a two page detailed document about like how things work and everything.

191
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,500
And even I'm just sitting here going, wait, how the fuck do you build an edition?

192
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,899
Oh, so like 20 minutes ago, I was in there explaining how to do an edition

193
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,269
because I was like, wait a minute, why is this not working?

194
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,990
Oh, that's right.

195
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,590
You can't have anything on the other side.

196
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:53,399
We were we were like troubleshooting with each other like 20 minutes ago.

197
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,080
I didn't even tweet the stream.

198
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,100
There's like 10 fucking streamers here.

199
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,190
Give me a second.

200
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,830
Hold on.

201
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:26,279
I'm going to say live right now with the house flipper speed build with streamers.

202
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,100
It's not really a tournament.

203
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,220
You're wasting time.

204
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,740
I mean, the whole goal for the first hour of this stream on my end is to waste time.

205
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,860
So don't worry.

206
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,820
The timer is for you and for them to know how much time they have left.

207
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,700
Should I go in there?

208
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:52,090
Should I have the mods on mute and have me just be like, you got 25 minutes left.

209
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:52,809
It's a contest.

210
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:53,529
It's not a tournament.

211
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:54,169
It's a contest.

212
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,159
Well, it's not even a contest.

213
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,220
When you're in school, you know, like a science class,

214
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,460
is it a contest with your fellow students?

215
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,779
No, you just get individually graded.

216
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:07,299
I don't want to give anybody an F though.

217
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,900
I feel like I haven't heard somebody's feelings.

218
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,259
Should I not give somebody an F?

219
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,119
Budwig is, I don't want to know.

220
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:20,599
I don't want to know what he's doing.

221
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,069
Give them all Fs.

222
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:29,480
They deserve it.

223
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,319
They all should have Fs.

224
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,750
Why is your camera off center?

225
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,390
I don't know.

226
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,470
Because I put it above this thing.

227
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,279
Oh, because I'm leaning in.

228
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:42,599
Okay.

229
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:49,529
Let me just live right now with the house flipper speed build in unofficial invitational.

230
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:55,099
Because does it even matter if I tweet something?

231
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,119
It's probably like only 50 people that see this through Twitter.

232
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:08,680
I was going to say the unofficial invitational.

233
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,400
I got time.

234
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,839
I like how I don't have to.

235
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,880
This is great.

236
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,990
We can just sit here and watch a clock for an hour and I don't have to do anything.

237
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,190
This is perfect.

238
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,710
I should do this more often.

239
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,740
Because I can hear in the other room, right?

240
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,819
A streamer freaking out.

241
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:27,059
Being like, how the fuck do I use this tool?

242
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:27,720
What the fuck?

243
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,359
This is this game.

244
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,480
What's wrong with this game?

245
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,599
I can't fucking pick this up.

246
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,759
They didn't read the instructions.

247
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:43,430
The birds are just chirping.

248
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,549
Ah, this is nice.

249
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:45,190
I feel great.

250
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,660
Look good right now.

251
00:18:50,660 --> 00:19:02,650
All right, live right now with house flipper unofficial invitational with streamers.

252
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,339
I could add every single person, couldn't I?

253
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:10,700
Should I add every single person here?

254
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,339
You should.

255
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:19,259
Yeah.

256
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,099
I'm going to spend an hour.

257
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:32,680
I'm going to spend my timer is making a tweet in an hour.

258
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,400
Can I do it?

259
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,960
Can I make it?

260
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,039
Can I tweet my own event within the time that the event is taking place?

261
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,619
At this, there's two of these people.

262
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:43,339
I can't do it.

263
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:43,819
I can't do it.

264
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:44,539
I can't look at it.

265
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,910
I hate looking at this.

266
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,349
It's in your title.

267
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,559
What is my title?

268
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,440
Oh, that's right.

269
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,789
We're good.

270
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:57,190
Okay.

271
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,890
At this is going to go over the character limit.

272
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:13,109
At seadog at italics.

273
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:13,509
Okay.

274
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,440
At who else is here at Ludwig.

275
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,380
This is what this is what people do.

276
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,900
This is the longest tweet of all time.

277
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,799
At people that aren't here.

278
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,220
No, that's stupid.

279
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,390
At Kraken.

280
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,049
No, I'm just I'm doing it.

281
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:42,890
This this I can't this is too many characters.

282
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,660
I can't even do it.

283
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,779
You have Twitter plus.

284
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:49,660
I don't even know what that is.

285
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,579
What is Twitter plus?

286
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:55,940
Is a Twitter plus?

287
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,630
Are you stupid?

288
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,589
All right, I'll do it.

289
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,700
I'll do it.

290
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,339
I'll do it.

291
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:08,839
Hold on.

292
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,960
Let me stretch first.

293
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,609
I swear to God.

294
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:12,970
I actually like need to hold on.

295
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:21,509
I got a DM.

296
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:21,910
Poke.

297
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:26,339
Okay.

298
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:26,740
Hold on.

299
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,380
Hold on.

300
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,779
Hold on.

301
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:28,180
Hold on.

302
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,859
Poke is in my DMS right now.

303
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:36,019
Poke is I think on his way.

304
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:36,660
All right.

305
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,579
Well, I think poke is on his way here.

306
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:45,339
You got you got an hour and five minutes.

307
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:55,799
That's so funny.

308
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,339
Add extra time for poke.

309
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:01,059
Well, it was 60 minutes, but we made it 75.

310
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:08,660
So technically we did technically that we did.

311
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:16,900
Yeah, we'll put we'll put poke on the end.

312
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,859
That's so funny.

313

He said he said it's not tomorrow.

314
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:26,740
Focus on your tweet.

Okay.

318
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:35,900

328
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,240
Yeah, Vinesauce.

329
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,039
All right.

330
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:15,079
I'm ready to put my tweet out for my big event.

331
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,019
That's everybody, right?

332
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,900
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

333
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,779
Wait, I'm missing somebody.

334
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,660
Who am I missing?

335
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,700
No, no, no, there's one more.

336
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,059
No, no, no, I got Connery's pants.

337
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:26,619
No, I didn't.

338
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,500
I thought I put him first.

339
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:39,269
I put the other Connor.

340
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,059
Okay, there it is.

341
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:43,779
I'm ready to tweet it.

342
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:44,500
You guys ready?

343
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,690
Make sure you retweet it.

344
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,130
Make sure you retweet this.

345
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,880
Make sure I got everybody.

346
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,539
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

347
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:04,339
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

348
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:05,059
There we go.

349
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:05,940
Hey, look at that.

350
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,650
I did it.

351
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,529
Yeah.

352
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:16,339
So anyways, if you don't know anything about House Flipper,

353
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,980
let me give you some quick education here.

354
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,779
House Flipper is a game where you clean houses.

355
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:26,819
You flip them.

356
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:29,450
You add interior walls.

357
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,809
So you're like, I can clean.

358
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:36,099
You try to make it look as nice as you can.

359
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,380
Walls can come down.

360
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,480
I hope this isn't loud.

361
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,599
It probably will be.

362
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:42,920
So I'm going to do this for a sec.

363
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,099
I probably should have mentioned that to all the streamers.

364
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:47,420
That the, actually, no, it's okay.

365
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,539
No, they probably patched it.

366
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,730
You tagged the wrong vine sauce.

367
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,289
What do you mean?

368
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,759
I did?

369
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,460
No, I didn't.

370
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,420
Great tweet.

371
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,900
No, I didn't.

372
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,259
I got it right.

373
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:06,740
All right.

374
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,460
How are people doing?

375
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:10,420
Who is in the lead in your opinion?

376
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,500
Who is like, wow, they know exactly what they're doing.

377
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:23,750
I hate this tweet bit.

378
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,309
I just did it.

379
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,579
It's over.

380
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:28,819
It's the entire Vinesauce team account.

381
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,609
Well, it's all right.

382
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:33,930
It's all right.

383
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:39,220
Let me get back over here so I can see what people are doing.

384
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,180
Okay, we're good.

385
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,599
It technically is the wrong account.

386
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:48,630
Oh, that's all right.

387
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,869
All right.

388
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:51,509
So let me just give you a quick rundown.

389
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,950
Everybody is doing what I'm doing right now.

390
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,950
They're probably very far ahead of what I'm doing.

391
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,309
I wonder how many people are just panicking,

392
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:58,309
just sitting around biting their fingernails going,

393
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,349
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

394
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:00,680
I don't know what to do.

395
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,119
I will show you.

396
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,079
And I'm also here unmuted in case somebody has a question.

397
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:05,720
It's very important.

398
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,000
If somebody comes in here and is like,

399
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,160
hey, dude, can you please help me?

400
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,119
How do I do this again?

401
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:14,700
I want to be able to be here to tell them.

402
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,980
But House Flipper has many, many, many, many tools,

403
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,420
many things for you to do.

404
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,799
For instance, I can paint the walls whatever color I want.

405
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,880
I can take down pretty much any wall.

406
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,559
You can do wallpaper.

407
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,990
So let's just say for the instance this.

408
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,910
Yeah, like just panels.

409
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,269
I know a lot of you know this already,

410
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:37,029
but this might be people here that have no idea

411
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:38,390
that are here from other people's streams,

412
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,700
so on and so forth.

413
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,339
So I can.

414
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:42,859
Jerma, I have a question.

415
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:43,500
Yep.

416
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,180
Sorry, I scared the shit out of myself

417
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,539
because you came in here and I scared the shit.

418
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,579
You scared the shit out of me.

419
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:47,819
All right.

420
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,940
So is there a way to like bar window?

421
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,380
Like if I wanted like from the inside,

422
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,109
like put bars on the windows.

423
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:57,720
Like actually put bars on the windows.

424
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:57,960
Right.

425
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,119
Like so someone like couldn't get out of the room

426
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,509
if like through the window.

427
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:05,269
I don't think so.

428
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,880
Oh, but can they hear you?

429
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,359
I don't know.

430
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:08,839
Yeah, they can.

431
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,559
Yeah, they're lying to me.

432
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,279
I don't think you can put bars on the windows.

433
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,440
If you like bars on the windows,

434
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,039
I would say you probably should leave the bars

435
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,299
that are already on the windows.

436
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:18,940
Okay.

437
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,859
Because I don't think you can put.

438
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:21,740
You can sell the window.

439
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,339
You can put a new window in,

440
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:26,390
but I don't think you can put bars on it.

441
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,910
All right, I'll figure this out.

442
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,390
Thank you.

443
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,180
Yeah, so what happened to your eyebrows?

444
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,900
What do you mean?

445
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,420
What's wrong with my eyebrows?

446
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,579
I mean, my hair lightens up in the summer

447
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:39,859
because I'm out in the sun.

448
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:41,619
We're going to my garden, bro.

449
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:43,779
They're gone.

450
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:44,500
They're not.

451
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,539
What are you talking about?

452
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,150
What are you talking about?

453
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:54,519
My eyebrows lighten up in the summer.

454
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:03,160
My eyebrows are right here.

455
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,599
This grass in Vegas.

456
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,059
Well, I have sunflowers,

457
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:10,069
which I'm supposed to give you an update on those today,

458
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:13,910
but it's just not going to happen.

459
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,309
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,299
You have a unibrow.

461
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:16,779
I'm German.

462
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:18,259
Is that German?

463
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:22,099
This isn't cheating to just ask you a question mid-contest, is it?

464
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:22,660
No, no, no.

465
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,220
You're in fact the second or third person who's done so.

466
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,619
So yeah.

467
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:26,180
Thank God.

468
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,059
What can I do for you?

469
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:27,940
What can I do for your RT?

470
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,299
How do I fill in an existing hole in the house,

471
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:33,140
like in the concrete foundation,

472
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,940
like there's just gaps in the walls and I want to put wall in there.

473
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,180
Okay.

474
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,380
So you are going to hold right click

475
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,700
and you have build inlets or build walls and lintels.

476
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,299
Okay, I see build lintels.

477
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,380
That's for like a lower wall, is it?

478
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,779
Yeah, but lintels you can put up.

479
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:53,900
You can't put them down,

480
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,019
but you can build that build tool is how you cover up gaps.

481
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:01,259
Okay, but what if it's like a garage door or something like that?

482
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,380
Because I'm trying to...

483
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,019
Okay, let me see.

484
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,619
But so you want to...

485
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:09,210
What I'm imagining is you want to replace the garage door is what you're saying.

486
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,609
You know, I found a solution.

487
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,009
Yep.

488
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:13,130
It's grand.

489
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:13,609
Okay.

490
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:14,809
Thank you so much.

491
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:15,289
Thank you.

492
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:15,849
Yep, you got it.

493
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:16,650
You'll be all right from here.

494
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,049
Okay.

495
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:17,369
Thank you.

496
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:20,150
Tech support.

497
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:23,670
I'm here for an hour to meet tech support.

498
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,960
That's so funny though.

499
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,559
No help, no help, no help.

500
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,119
You didn't help.

501
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:28,920
Oh, I didn't help.

502
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,849
That's fine.

503
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:39,819
No help.

504
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:40,539
Tech support.

505
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,460
Time is actually ticking.

506
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,619
I heard nervousness in that voice.

507
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:51,740
Okay, let me make some stuff.

508
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,170
Let me do the lawn.

509
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:03,880
All right, let's get the tree trunk.

510
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,529
I'm going to clean up.

511
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,819
I'm going to do a lawn.

512
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:09,640
I think a lot of people are sleeping on the lawn.

513
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,319
I tried to make that really clear.

514
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:16,069
I did say, guys, the lawn is important.

515
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:17,670
Look at the lawn, the lawn.

516
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:23,339
Only one person asked about the lawn and I'm not going to tell you who.

517
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,059
I did have one inquisitive response about the lawn.

518
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:38,420
I should have read this syllabus.

519
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,980
Yeah.

520
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:49,099
Won't your own house impact grading?

521
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:50,619
No, no, we're going to get tours.

522
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:54,220
People are going to share through Discord or through potentially,

523
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,140
if it doesn't work, I can just pull up their streams too.

524
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,019
What about indoor lawns?

525
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,779
I'm not telling anybody how to make anything.

526
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:05,660
One of the theories was if people had fun doing this,

527
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:08,970
if this was a fun time for everybody,

528
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,930
is maybe expand it and do it again another time.

529
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,769
Now that people have understand the format

530
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:17,289
and include themings that you have to go by,

531
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:19,450
especially with House Flipper 2.

532
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,029
House Flipper 2 is going to be so much more elaborate than this

533
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:27,259
that I feel like that could be a lot of fun stuff.

534
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,710
I'm very interested.

535
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,630
But if people like it, if people are like,

536
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,990
yeah, that was really, really swell.

537
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,109
I want to do that again.

538
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:34,789
Then we can start to do things like,

539
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:41,690
hey, the theme for this one is green.

540
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:52,250
I'm going to give you three words, green, bark, and food.

541
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,049
And that's it.

542
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:56,390
Good luck and see what people come up with.

543
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,589
This one was more, I'm just going to let people go kind of wild

544
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:01,109
with whatever they want to do.

545
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:05,160
And I might just remove F.

546
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,720
I feel like some, I feel like a couple people are going to be like,

547
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,640
hey, man, I just had no idea what the fuck is going on.

548
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,140
And I don't want to give him an F.

549
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:22,819
Maybe I'll take away F, bark.

550
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:23,859
That's fair.

551
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,460
Yeah, F is a little harsh, I think.

552
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,920
But no F can ever be lower than 55 points.

553
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:36,299
Just keep it.

554
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,859
That's, no, you have to, that's spineless.

555
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:41,849
What do you mean?

556
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:45,579
Is it harsh?

557
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:46,940
Don't hurt their feelings.

558
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,180
I'm going to try not to.

559
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:55,480
We're down to, they, all right,

560
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,910
they're down to, they've only got 53 minutes.

561
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:06,819
It's unfair to the people that try.

562
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:12,070
I'm going to laugh my ass off.

563
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,590
I'm going to laugh my fucking ass off.

564
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,329
If poke shows up with like 20 minutes left

565
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,969
and just like fucking freaks out and gets in the game

566
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:21,610
and makes a banger of a house.

567
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,409
Do you know what I mean?

568
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,250
Like, I feel like that's possible.

569
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,239
That's so funny.

570
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:36,550
All right, let's do some, let's cut some, let's cut the grass.

571
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,789
I don't even know if people know you had, there's a lawnmower.

572
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:57,639
There's going to be people picking up blades of grass by hand.

573
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,480
Everybody is inside at this point.

574
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,840
Okay, interesting.

575
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:09,579
D won't be insulting.

576
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:10,780
Put on some music.

577
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,739
We could put some music on.

578
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:13,179
I mean, we're just hanging out anyways.

579
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:17,500
Put on, I don't know, like Animal Crossing.

580
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:31,239
It's the easy go-to.

581
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:33,300
Ah, nice.

582
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,719
Only 51 minutes left.

583
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,360
Oh, that's like, I got a long time to relax.

584
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,289
I'll change F to 60.

585
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:52,010
We'll make it a D.

586
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,989
Yeah, we'll make it a D.

587
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,980
If I was going to give an F, I'm just going to give a 60.

588
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:03,099
There you go.

589
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:05,019
The F just doesn't exist anymore.

590
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:14,090
Play Hell's Kitchen music.

591
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,849
Yeah, I'll do that when there's like five minutes left.

592
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,699
When there's like five or ten minutes left,

593
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:22,250
I will play Hell's Kitchen music and just start yelling at people.

594
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,090
Let's let, let's let them work.

595
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,090
Let them actually try.

596
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,449
I don't want to give pressure right now.

597
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:40,010
All right, let's sell this.

598
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:47,190
All right, Poke is here.

599
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:55,929
All right, let me get, let me get Poke just quick instructions.

600
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:56,969
I said poke hop on the call.

601
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:10,889
I can give him a quick, I can give him a quick, quick rundown.

602
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,460
He's, he's got, it's still 50 minutes.

603
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,900
Look, I, these are individual grades, so I can know that I can know.

604
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,840
Hey, hey, what's up?

605
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,400
Hi.

606
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,239
Hey, all right, we're live right now.

607
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:32,199
There's currently 50 minutes left in the competition.

608
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,360
We started with, yeah, we started with an hour.

609
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,280
We went up, we went up to 75 minutes.

610
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,690
So you're actually not that, you, you still got some time.

611
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,409
Listen, I read it was tomorrow and I was at an aquarium.

612
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:43,690
I, I'm home now.

613
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,579
I'm here.

614
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,300
Well, the aquarium probably sounds fucking awesome.

615
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,019
It was great.

616
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:48,900
It was great.

617
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,659
Yeah, but I don't want to, in the game, everything ready.

618
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,300
I'm ready to go.

619
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,699
I don't want to take up any more of your time, but the house you need to open,

620
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:56,420
you need to open, it's called Garden After the House Built.

621
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,539
That's the house everybody's doing.

622
00:37:57,539 --> 00:37:58,579
That's the house you need to build.

623
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:01,400
Okay, which one?

624
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,059
So go to the laptop, go to browser, go to houses that you can buy

625
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:09,179
and make sure you've done the cheats to give yourself the half million dollars.

626
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,139
You're going to scroll down.

627
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:12,139
It's got a bunch of wooded windows.

628
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:13,019
You're going to get in there.

629
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:15,420
It's called Garden After House Built.

630
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,630
That's the one you're going to.

631
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,429
Garden After House Built.

632
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,230
That's the one right there.

633
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,630
Go, say go now and get going.

634
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,929
And you're only about 10 to 15 minutes behind.

635
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:24,329
All right.

636
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:25,369
Going in now.

637
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:25,929
Oh, hell yeah.

638
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:26,250
All right.

639
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,050
Timer's gone.

640
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,929
Good luck.

641
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:33,739
Bye.

642
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:34,219
All right.

643
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,900
Good to see Poke.

644
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,139
We got everybody now.

645
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,260
The aquarium.

646
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,920
Well, that sounds fun.

647
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,369
He's freaking out right now.

648
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:58,940
Well, if you see this and knowing that you've lost potentially 25, 30 minutes of time,

649
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:01,909
it's almost like, what do I even do?

650
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,190
I guess go through the windows.

651
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,750
Jerma, why weren't you invited?

652
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,860
I tried to give a tutorial of how to build additions,

653
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,909
but I feel like, okay, you know when a teacher,

654
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:26,260
when a teacher explains something and very clearly the whole class is quiet

655
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,199
and everyone's like, all right, can you show us again?

656
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,760
It's just like, oh, shit.

657
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,079
All right.

658
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,199
Nobody got that.

659
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,159
Nobody got that.

660
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,500
I have to, I have to do it again

661
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:47,960
because there's very specific things you can't do with the addition builder.

662
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,329
I wonder, I wonder.

663
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,210
This is House Lipper 1.

664
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,730
House Lipper 2 is not out yet.

665
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:59,619
Play Halls of Torment.

666
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:00,659
I actually saw that.

667
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:01,699
I wanted to play it.

668
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,659
That's definitely on the list 100%.

669
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,449
It's very pog.

670
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Joel thinks he's almost out of time.

671
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,500
You're not almost out of time.

672
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:33,429
The Hell's Kitchen music hasn't started.

673
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:34,710
That's so fucking funny.

674
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,909
I don't know if, can we, mods, can you undefinite and unmute everybody for,

675
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,590
oh, no, no, just undefinite everybody for a second.

676
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,309
Don't unmute them.

677
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,670
Just undefinite them in here.

678
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,510
Can we do that so I can tell them to the time check?

679
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:49,929
We cannot.

680
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,530
We can't.

681
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,090
Okay, okay.

682
00:40:52,730 --> 00:41:06,570
Well, sorry everybody, but we can only, okay, we can ping them.

683
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,929
Yeah, maybe ping everybody and just say, hey, 45 minutes, 45 minute warning.

684
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:14,420
This is going quick.

685
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,539
Oh, this is, I'm excited.

686
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,739
I'm so happy about this.

687
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:17,780
I'm having fun.

688
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,500
I'm having fun just like experiencing what I think

689
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,260
I'm going to experience in 45 minutes.

690
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:32,920
Come on, dig.

691
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,420
I can't dig this one.

692
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:38,139
Oh, is this a bug in this map?

693
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,460
Are they all freaking out about this?

694
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,820
Okay, there we go.

695
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,579
Yeah, alert, 45 minutes remaining.

696
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,099
What about a time extension?

697
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,219
We talked about a time extension.

698
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,030
The one thing that's important about this whole stream here

699
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:12,460
is everybody has to give a five to seven minute tour at the end of this.

700
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,269
And I don't want to extend it too far because the people that,

701
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:19,429
there's some people from EU, there's people with time constraints today.

702
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:20,869
And I didn't want it to be like, oh yeah, like,

703
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:31,900
so this would be like a seven hour experience for all of you.

704
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
I don't think anybody even knows that you can do this.

705
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,190
See, what I'm really looking forward to is somebody kind of thinking outside the box.

706
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,579
You know what would be outside the box?

707
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:45,019
Keeping the whole house boarded up and making an incredible garden.

708
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,639
That's where you get creativity A plus for me.

709
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,449
Don't tell them that though.

710
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:50,809
Don't ever tell anybody that.

711
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,329
Why is the game so dark?

712
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,900
Because it's technically nighttime right now.

713
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,699
I don't know why.

714
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:04,469
I guess I could just reset it so you can see better.

715
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:07,400
That's inside the box.

716
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,119
No, that's outside the box because the house is inside.

717
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,989
That would be outside the box.

718
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:15,829
Let poke bill for an extra 15 minutes.

719
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:16,710
That's actually fair.

720
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:21,269
That's fair because poke is not scheduled to do his tour until a little bit later.

721
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:22,309
So that's fair for me.

722
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,789
That's fair.

723
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,989
So let's just go browser.

724
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:36,309
I'm just going to just teleport around just to get it back to daytime.

725
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:41,750
Derma explaining things is so funny to me.

726
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,710
Can you please help poke?

727
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,909
He's freaking out.

728
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:48,380
Poke need help.

729
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:50,469
I can answer questions.

730
00:43:50,469 --> 00:44:06,360
I can answer technical questions.

731
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:06,840
Tech support.

732
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:13,539
Yeah, he's panicking.

733
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,909
There we go.

734
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:26,469
So it seems like most people have started outside,

735
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,090
which is fair.

736
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,250
But how many of them actually put grass down?

737
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:37,190
And what is their philosophy?

738
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:39,110
And what the fuck is philosophy?

739
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:39,670
I don't know.

740
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:42,710
I just put it there because I wanted to have four grades.

741
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,449
So I have mods.

742
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:50,199
I do want to bring this up because so when we do chats grade,

743
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,920
we're just going to do it in just solid letters.

744
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:57,929
So it's only going to be A, B, C, or D,

745
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:02,730
because that'll be technically that'd be 95, 85, 75, 65 points.

746
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:05,289
So we can't do like a whole scale.

747
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:06,409
I don't think I mean, maybe we could.

748
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:08,010
How many how many things do we have in the poll?

749
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,980
We could do A plus A, A.

750
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,219
I don't want to do that many though,

751
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,900
because it's based on points.

752
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:22,579
So I think 95 could be fine if you wanted to do an A.

753
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,230
Poke is trying to sell the walls right now.

754
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,510
Hey, give him a break.

755
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,710
He was at the aquarium.

756
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:57,590
Okay, he was at the aquarium.

757
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,050
So how poke could really spin this.

758
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,159
I don't want to give anybody any help.

759
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,280
No help, no help.

760
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,440
But there is an animal DLC.

761
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,800
And if you figure out how to use it,

762
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,360
if you can go back and maybe see how to do that,

763
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,619
he could make an aquarium

764
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:18,420
and just show us all the fishes that he saw.

765
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:25,210
I don't want to give anybody any tips though.

766
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,849
Yeah, we'll just do A, B, C, D.

767
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:34,420
And it'll do the point system will be to be 95, 85, 75, 65

768
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,250
for your grade.

769
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,190
I have a whole spreadsheet here to calculate everything.

770
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,909
So don't worry.

771
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:43,099
Vinny's doing his best.

772
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:46,650
Ludwig is doing something horrendous.

773
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,000
I can't, I cannot wait.

774
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,360
We're getting down there.

775
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,179
Let me just at least paint one of the walls.

776
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:01,980
Because people are going to be like,

777
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,019
well, what about your house?

778
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:03,900
What about your house?

779
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,420
And I'd be like, well, it's not my.

780
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,699
So let me get it to look at least okay.

781
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:25,429
The grading scale, the grading scale has changed.

782
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:31,190
I mean, poke is asking if other people scrimmed for this.

783
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:31,989
I don't think so.

784
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:38,280
A is now 90 to 100, not 95.

785
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,940
I'm going on a boomer grades.

786
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:46,250
Sorry.

787
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,019
And A, when I was in school,

788
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:53,880
an A minus was 90, 91, 92.

789
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,000
An A was 93, 94, 95, 96.

790
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,760
And I believe also 97.

791
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,559
An A plus I think was 98, 99, 100.

792
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:06,599
Yeah, A plus is 100.

793
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,079
A plus was 100, 99, and 98.

794
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:12,630
I believe 93 to 97 was just A.

795
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,380
We're not Americans.

796
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,400
I am.

797
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,760
And this is my American school.

798
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,239
This is my American house flipper school.

799
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:24,460
We're going by American grades.

800
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,380
Sorry.

801
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,630
97 is an A plus.

802
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,989
I think that's true.

803
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:41,400
He's American.

804
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,599
Is that what do you mean?

805
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:43,610
Yeah.

806
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,110
Yeah.

807
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:50,400
Wait.

808
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,719
All right.

809
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:57,920
Anyways, what about an S plus rank?

810
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,679
Now I like S.

811
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,489
I think S is a great addition to have.

812
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:07,050
But there's no S in high school or college grades.

813
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:20,639
Can we say poke's viewers are messing with him?

814
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,719
Poke's viewers are messing with how many minutes he has

815
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,079
and he is mega panicking.

816
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,340
Poor poke.

817
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,579
He probably was like walking around like,

818
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:36,559
wow, oh, look at that shark.

819
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,000
Whoa, look at that fish.

820
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,880
And he didn't even know that that 75 minutes had started.

821
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,420
He's probably sitting there like, oh, whoa, this is so cool.

822
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,659
He probably went to lunch, probably had a wonderful lunch

823
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:59,360
and just had no idea that he was being timed at the aquarium.

824
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:07,199
You've ruined his field trip.

825
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:14,750
You called all these people into work.

826
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,829
People are telling me he has four minutes.

827
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:17,469
All right.

828
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:22,510
Communicate with poke that he has 37 minutes left and longer.

829
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:27,710
He actually has 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52.

830
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,829
Poke has like another hour to make his house.

831
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:34,250
Poke has another hour.

832
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:42,829
Dude, he is soaking right now.

833
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:43,949
What do you mean?

834
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:45,789
He went swimming at the aquarium?

835
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:50,110
What are you talking about?

836
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:50,750
You can't.

837
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,570
Does this place have a pool?

838
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:06,429
Poke gets an extra 30 minutes.

839
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:10,570
I think it's fair to give poke at least 15 to 20 extra minutes.

840
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:28,489
Poke's title is in all caps.

841
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:31,130
You know, it's going to be really fun.

842
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,110
One of the reasons I did this a whole event is obviously

843
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,949
I'm just kind of walking around and just,

844
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:36,989
I'm just talking to you guys.

845
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,590
Like I'm the judge, right?

846
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:42,030
I'm just waiting.

847
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,389
There's a lot of content for him.

848
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:46,030
I just want to go watch everybody's stream.

849
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,360
That's what I'm going to do tonight.

850
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,760
I think like lying down in like bed

851
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,280
or just like on the couch or something.

852
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,079
I'm just going to go through and just pick out everybody's

853
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:00,650
and just kind of just sit there and watch how they did it.

854
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,769
This sounds fun.

855
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:03,210
All right.

856
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,010
Let's put some grass down.

857
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,909
It is turf, I believe.

858
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:11,150
Yes.

859
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:20,730
Oh, wrong way.

860
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:21,690
It's all right.

861
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,329
I can do both ways.

862
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:30,460
There we.

863
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,300
Vinny has one room.

864
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,480
Vinny does not know how to spell refrigerator.

865
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:45,719
Do we need to give everybody an extra 20 minutes?

866
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,530
Do we have to give everybody an extra 10 to 20 minutes?

867
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,880
If people are down, I am willing to extend by another 20 minutes.

868
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,539
But it depends.

869
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:01,980
People might have something to do today.

870
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:09,070
They need it.

871
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:09,550
They need it.

872
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:10,110
They need it.

873
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:10,590
No, no.

874
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,190
It's way funnier if you don't.

875
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:17,000
An hour goes by pretty quickly as you see,

876
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,519
especially when you know it's counting down.

877
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,210
All right.

878
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:21,769
Here's what we're going to do.

879
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:25,420
We're going to stick to the plan when it's pencils down.

880
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,179
What we're going to do is we're going to get everybody in a call

881
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:28,539
and I'm going to propose.

882
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:30,139
How does everybody feel?

883
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,460
Does everybody feel like if we could all get a majority

884
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,059
for an extra 20 minutes?

885
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:37,019
We'll see.

886
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,309
If not, then we might just go for it.

887
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:46,989
We might get three or four people that are like,

888
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:49,800
look, man, I've got shit to do today.

889
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,719
And that's all right.

890
00:53:53,719 --> 00:54:02,989
It's got to be unanimous.

891
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,070
Vinny doesn't know how to spell refrigerator.

892
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,329
You spell it.

893
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:34,480
OK, how do you spell it?

894
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:37,000
How do you spell refrigerator?

895
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:40,829
Is there a quicker way to paint?

896
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:41,150
Yep.

897
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,719
OK, so when you are you in, are you inside or outside?

898
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:45,519
I'm inside.

899
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:46,960
OK, so you're inside.

900
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,239
You have the painting tool, right?

901
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:52,269
You you can paint because you if you did you did

902
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:54,940
you did the cheats to make sure that you did all the perks, right?

903
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,659
Yeah, I got them all.

904
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,619
OK, so you can paint three or four walls at the same time,

905
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:03,659
but there is no faster way to go with paint unless you go outside with the paint spray.

906
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:04,300
Oh, fuck.

907
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:04,860
That sucks.

908
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,900
OK, so you need to what you can do up to four walls at a time painting.

909
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,139
But yeah, you do have to paint the walls individually.

910
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:13,340
You do.

911
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,139
Oh, that sucks.

912
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:15,179
OK, that's fine.

913
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:18,619
By the way, there is 32 minutes remaining as of right now.

914
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,059
I think it'll be fine.

915
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:20,699
I think it'll be fine.

916
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:21,340
Thank you so much.

917
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:27,679
Just want to make sure you are aware.

918
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah, so the question that Connor had is a very good one.

919
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:44,800
It is OK.

920
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:51,480
So for instance, like Connor is asking is, can you go faster than this?

921
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,039
And it's going to be slow for me because I don't have all the upgrades.

922
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,909
But if you have all the upgrades, you can do a few panels at a time.

923
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:00,429
You can do I think up to four or five.

924
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:02,239
So but that's part of it.

925
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:08,489
That's part of your process is what's important.

926
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:12,159
I mean, it's just it's it's with all the upgrades.

927
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,429
Should be able to get at least most of a wall.

928
00:56:16,429 --> 00:56:17,880
All right.

929
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,440
Refrigerator.

930
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:18,840
Right.

931
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,639
How do I do that?

932
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:21,289
OK.

933
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:21,849
Refrigerator.

934
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:23,710
How do you spell it?

935
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:23,949
Re.

936
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,460
There's no D.

937
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,469
It's just Refrigerator.

938
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:32,190
Really?

939
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:36,480
But that's how you spell fridge.

940
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:42,510
That's how you spell fridge.

941
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:43,550
So why is it Re?

942
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:46,030
Why is it not Refrigerator?

943
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,349
Why is it Refrigerator?

944
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:48,829
That's weird.

945
00:56:52,269 --> 00:56:55,630
Fridge is with a D.

946
00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:00,519
Can you do can you do turf in the house?

947
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:01,400
No, you can't.

948
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,519
You can't do turf in the house.

949
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,480
Sorry, everybody.

950
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,829
What colors do I want to do?

951
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,659
I should just do like a congratulations.

952
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:16,889
You did it.

953
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:17,130
All right.

954
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,679
I'm going to put like just like party stuff here.

955
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:28,489
Uh, like party, uh, like decorations.

956
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:29,050
Christmas.

957
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:29,610
Here we go.

958
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,110
Welcome.

959
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:35,260
Yeah, here we go.

960
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:45,150
We'll put like this everywhere.

961
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,110
Uh, we'll do that.

962
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:53,159
We'll do, um, we'll put like Christmas stuff maybe.

963
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:53,639
Here we go.

964
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:12,800
I guess your eyes are sucking my soul out.

965
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,000
Hey, you need to relax.

966
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,639
All right.

967
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:19,400
Um, by the way, I, I feel like people didn't look into this,

968
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,119
but there's a grappling hook to get up here.

969
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:22,920
It's all right.

970
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,280
I, I know they were under, they're under a little bit of stress.

971
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,849
This is a chainsaw.

972
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,650
You can get trees down faster.

973
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:51,949
Build a wipeout course.

974
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,630
Ludwig found the flamethrower.

975
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,559
It's possible he just ruins his whole thing then.

976
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,039
Don't tell him.

977
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:00,599
Ludwig might accidentally click the button and burn the whole house down.

978
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:11,880
And then, sorry, he already did that.

979
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:13,159
Oh, no.

980
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,920
Ludwig cannot find a certain paint right now.

981
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:35,500
There was some interesting questions because, so, the question was asked.

982
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,099
Hey, this is two stories, man.

983
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:38,059
That's a lot.

984
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:40,159
And I was like, yeah, it is.

985
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,960
Oh, all right.

986
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,559
And they were like, oh, okay.

987
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,780
But here's the thing.

988
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,329
Take a look.

989
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:49,690
You want to build the houses.

990
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,869
You can make this a whole thing.

991
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:59,239
I wonder who's the most focused.

992
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:01,880
I think they were anticipating it was going to be one floor.

993
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,329
If you want to do one really great floor, that's fine.

994
01:00:06,329 --> 01:00:08,570
Your complexity and your structure will be suffering,

995
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,889
but your creativity score might be through the roof.

996
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:20,840
I looked at Lud's stream and I regret it.

997
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,980
Here's a really important question.

998
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,840
Has anybody cleaned their whole yard?

999
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:40,699
Has anybody cleaned their yard?

1000
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:44,599
Most people did.

1001
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,219
Hoke is kind of cooking low key.

1002
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:48,780
All right.

1003
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,420
All right.

1004
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,030
Let's let it out.

1005
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:52,989
Let's let him cook.

1006
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:58,940
Doug Doug did that first.

1007
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:10,280
Ludwig is eating a brick on stream right now.

1008
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,099
That sounds pretty fucked up.

1009
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:19,719
All right.

1010
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:31,519
I'm going to make my bathroom.

1011
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:34,000
I've never seen Ludwig this focused.

1012
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,050
How much extra time should poke get?

1013
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:40,730
Poke should get at least.

1014
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,119
When did he come into the call?

1015
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:46,429
When did poke come into the call?

1016
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:50,460
What was the timer when poke came into the call?

1017
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,699
It was 50 minutes.

1018
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:54,059
So 50, one hour.

1019
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:03,289
So poke should get poke should get 20 minutes extra.

1020
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:15,500
Give poke an extra 20 because that would be the same time.

1021
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:27,119
I think, I think that's fair.

1022
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,239
25 would be the same.

1023
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:30,760
We have to do.

1024
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,119
We have to deduce five minutes.

1025
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:33,719
We have to deduce at least five minutes.

1026
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:44,190
The, you know, we got to give a five minute penalty.

1027
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,190
I wonder if anyone's going to do anything outside.

1028
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,510
I feel like everyone's just like, okay, I got to build walls.

1029
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,070
I got to do this.

1030
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:49,949
What am I doing in this house?

1031
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:50,590
Okay, I want to build this.

1032
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:51,550
I want to do that.

1033
01:02:51,550 --> 01:03:00,119
But does anybody make like a nice fish pond out here?

1034
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:11,289
All right, let me do my bathroom.

1035
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:12,090
You mean deduct.

1036
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,050
I don't want to read chat anymore

1037
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:19,130
because that's funny what you just said.

1038
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:22,170
So I have to say it, but I, because I can't, I can't be,

1039
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,690
I have to be unbiased.

1040
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,929
Somebody said poke is painting his whole house right now

1041
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:30,079
with a paint color called intense rust.

1042
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,960
And I, I kind of have to delete that from my brain.

1043
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,280
I have to pretend like I did not hear that.

1044
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,960
I just, I have to just know.

1045
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,920
I can't know that.

1046
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:46,650
All right, let me get a door.

1047
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:56,750
That's a good bathroom door.

1048
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,869
I guess I could have typed it.

1049
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:17,519
This is funny.

1050
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:18,960
I'm having so much fun right now

1051
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,920
because I'm just imagining everybody else's streams.

1052
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,769
Is that weird?

1053
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:24,969
I'm sitting here just kind of hanging out.

1054
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:28,329
I'm watching imaginary streams right now.

1055
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:32,349
I don't know how many of you guys here are doing the same thing.

1056
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:35,920
Or if you're jumping around to see what people are doing.

1057
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,480
But I, I'm watching imaginary streams.

1058
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,039
I want, do people even know how to do what I just did?

1059
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,570
Like the door in the wall?

1060
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,650
Like in the inlet of the wall?

1061
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,050
I'm not even sure anybody knows how to do that.

1062
01:04:51,050 --> 01:05:04,889
Connor is watching a tutorial.

1063
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:10,000
That makes me, that's so funny to me.

1064
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,239
I can't wait to watch everybody's perspectives later.

1065
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:25,070
20 minute warning.

1066
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:28,429
The mods are paying in everybody in the channel.

1067
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:45,469
Could do Sims build invitational.

1068
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:47,789
I think the reason why this was doing it for me,

1069
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:51,630
the reason I thought this was funnier instead of the Sims

1070
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:54,679
is because first of all, it's 3D.

1071
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:56,440
It's a first person 3D game.

1072
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:02,329
And this game is very kind of oddly complicated.

1073
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:06,090
So you really do kind of need to know a lot of stuff about this game.

1074
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:11,289
I did try to give a detailed couple of pages of information to people.

1075
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:13,610
But even still, like I feel like there's some things,

1076
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:15,210
like how do you put panels on walls?

1077
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,409
I don't fucking know.

1078
01:06:16,409 --> 01:06:24,989
I have no idea.

1079
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:26,190
Yeah, the one minute warning.

1080
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:30,250
Yeah, once we get to 10 minutes, the Gordon Ramsay music is coming.

1081
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:44,059
All right, this must be a bathroom.

1082
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:51,980
We need bathroom.

1083
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,940
Oh, I need a fixture.

1084
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,840
They don't even know that either, do they?

1085
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,800
Yeah, you need an actual fixture on the wall.

1086
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,090
You need the thing that the toilet can actually sit in.

1087
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,050
You need plumbing.

1088
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:10,329
Do they know that?

1089
01:07:10,329 --> 01:07:13,210
Yeah, you'd like need this in the ground.

1090
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:22,320
Does anybody know this?

1091
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,119
There's no way they know.

1092
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:27,320
No, they definitely do.

1093
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,239
Okay, part of the tutorial I gave them was to do the first couple missions

1094
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:45,360
to understand this, like what this means.

1095
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,840
We might need like a 15 minute extension.

1096
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:52,559
Well, I guess if you do type in toilet,

1097
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,190
you'll see this and be like, wait, do I need that?

1098
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:00,940
And everybody's chats, I'm assuming are yelling at them how to do this.

1099
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:11,960
And they have to assemble it too.

1100
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,360
I can't wait to see half of the shit that's just not even assembled.

1101
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,529
Complexity and structure.

1102
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:24,380
Oh, that's minus my own points for complexity and structure.

1103
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,619
Ludwig is doing the Kubrick stare right now.

1104
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:31,199
Can I ask, how is italics doing?

1105
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:34,029
How is italics doing?

1106
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:35,229
Is italics doing okay?

1107
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:40,890
It's doing great.

1108
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:45,470
How is Doug Doug doing?

1109
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:50,670
Connor Eads Pants came in and asked a very specific question

1110
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:52,829
about putting bars on the windows.

1111
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:59,520
So I don't even want to know what he's doing.

1112
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,800
Joel is losing his mind.

1113
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,039
Vinnie, it feels like everybody's going insane.

1114
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:10,890
Do the houses have to be livable?

1115
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:13,640
No, no, that was not part of the criteria.

1116
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:19,359
It was just make the best house, the most interesting, the most just build,

1117
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:22,909
build a house that you want to build.

1118
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,989
Does anybody have an exterior wall yet?

1119
01:09:24,989 --> 01:09:26,430
Does anybody, are they all like this?

1120
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:26,989
I'm going to laugh.

1121
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:28,510
So don't tell me, I don't want to know.

1122
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:31,390
Actually, don't tell me if every single person has a fucking exterior

1123
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:33,229
that looks like this, I'm going to laugh my ass off.

1124
01:09:33,229 --> 01:09:34,109
Don't tell me.

1125
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:36,350
I actually, I'm going to wait till chat like settles down

1126
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:39,979
because I don't even want to look over here

1127
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:44,560
because that is so goddamn funny if everybody has the exact same exterior.

1128
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,640
The same exterior concrete like paint.

1129
01:09:51,310 --> 01:10:03,640
I can't look over at chat until it's safe.

1130
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,880
Do you know who's going to get a lot of points?

1131
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,680
Whoever has exterior paint on their house.

1132
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:16,520
Can we get a quick recap of the rules?

1133
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,159
Absolutely.

1134
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,630
There are 10, there are 10 people here.

1135
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:22,750
There are 10 streamers.

1136
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,949
Each one started at the same time with this house.

1137
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:28,109
This was all messed up.

1138
01:10:28,109 --> 01:10:29,390
The windows were all boarded up.

1139
01:10:30,029 --> 01:10:31,229
The lawn was all dirty.

1140
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:32,590
There was trash everywhere.

1141
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,189
Everybody started at the same time.

1142
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:36,270
They all had 75 minutes at the same time.

1143
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:37,310
One, two, three, go.

1144
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:39,420
They're all streaming their perspectives.

1145
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,939
They have to build the best house they can in that time limit.

1146
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:46,000
Well, except Poke.

1147
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,720
Yeah, except for Poke.

1148
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,850
Poke was here later, but we're good.

1149
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:50,970
Everybody's here now.

1150
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:52,010
So we're good.

1151
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,869
Everybody's building.

1152
01:10:53,869 --> 01:10:55,869
Everybody is currently intensely focused.

1153
01:10:55,869 --> 01:10:57,710
There's 16 minutes left.

1154
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:01,020
We might come to a unanimous decision.

1155
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,939
When everybody is like, I need more time.

1156
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:03,579
I need more time.

1157
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:05,979
If it's possible, we might get a unanimous decision

1158
01:11:05,979 --> 01:11:09,289
to add an extra like 15 to 20 minutes.

1159
01:11:09,289 --> 01:11:10,170
We might do that.

1160
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,920
It's possible.

1161
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,039
At the end of this, each person is going to individually give me

1162
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:18,880
a one-on-one tour of their house.

1163
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:20,960
So we have Discord here.

1164
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,149
We are Discord.

1165
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:26,750
I'm going to, they're going to share their Discord screen with the game.

1166
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,229
And they're going to walk me through it one-on-one.

1167
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:33,020
I'm going to, at the end of that, about five to seven minute tour.

1168
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,340
I'm going to be grading them based on a few categories.

1169
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:40,399
They're going to be graded on, and these are 100 through 60, the point system.

1170
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:45,069
Nobody gets an F because we figured that's kind of mean considering if somebody,

1171
01:11:45,069 --> 01:11:45,789
you know what I mean?

1172
01:11:45,789 --> 01:11:47,069
I don't want to be mean to anybody.

1173
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,550
So we got 100 point scale, 100 to 60.

1174
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,479
60 is the lowest you can get, D minus.

1175
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:57,470
So creativity is one of the categories.

1176
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:01,100
Complexity and structure is a category.

1177
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,119
Cleanliness is a category.

1178
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:05,630
Philosophy.

1179
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:07,869
What was your philosophy with this whole thing?

1180
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:09,520
That's a category.

1181
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,420
And then at the very end, you guys are going to get a grade too.

1182
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,899
Your grade is worth 10% of the overall grade.

1183
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:17,899
Creativity is worth 35%.

1184
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:20,319
Complexity is worth 25%.

1185
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:21,659
Cleanliness 15%.

1186
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,850
Philosophy 15%, adding up to 100.

1187
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:32,510
There you go.

1188
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,609
Philosophy is the vibes, bro.

1189
01:12:35,609 --> 01:12:37,930
That's exactly, you got it exactly.

1190
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:42,010
If you've got a fucked up house and you didn't do the walls right,

1191
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:44,960
but man, the vibes are immaculate in here.

1192
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,640
The philosophy was immaculate.

1193
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,680
That's an A.

1194
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:59,960
If nobody gets an F, doesn't that make D the new F?

1195
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:04,640
Probably.

1196
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,680
That's only 95%.

1197
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:17,930
35% plus 25% is 35, 45, 55, 60, plus 15, plus 15, which is 60, 70, 80, 90, plus 10%,

1198
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:20,199
which is your grade is 100.

1199
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:22,439
Trust me, I spent a lot of time on this.

1200
01:13:23,739 --> 01:13:30,399
This grading system was, I sat there for at least 15 minutes.

1201
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:32,720
No, it was actually at least, I actually spent time on this.

1202
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,880
I wanted to make sure this went off like, okay.

1203
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:42,079
So there was some time putting this.

1204
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:44,399
Have an F, but just don't give it to anybody.

1205
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:45,760
Stop wasting time.

1206
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:52,079
I'm not being graded.

1207
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,159
I am here merely as technical support and as a judge

1208
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:00,329
and to help you along the way understand what I'm doing this for.

1209
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:03,899
And the answer to that question is for absolutely no reason.

1210
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:05,789
Nobody wins anything.

1211
01:14:06,699 --> 01:14:09,739
Uh, the grades don't give you anything.

1212
01:14:09,739 --> 01:14:11,979
There's no winner.

1213
01:14:11,979 --> 01:14:17,050
It's just get some people together and make some fun shit.

1214
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:17,850
That's it.

1215
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:22,539
You should just leave the call and play something else.

1216
01:14:22,539 --> 01:14:23,739
Just don't even grade anybody.

1217
01:14:23,739 --> 01:14:24,939
Just be like, all right, later.

1218
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:35,550
Turn my stream off and just like delete the tweet.

1219
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:37,949
Every streamer right now is puking blood with stress.

1220
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:54,909
Intense rust.

1221
01:14:54,909 --> 01:14:58,699
I hope, I hope all the cheats were enabled for everybody

1222
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:00,539
because it actually would be very hard.

1223
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:03,260
The reason why the timer is okay where it is

1224
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:11,880
is because everybody should have all the tools unlocked and fully upgraded.

1225
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,319
Because what you are watching, I do not have the tools upgraded.

1226
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:21,260
Will there be a winner's build off after?

1227
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,880
I didn't really think that far.

1228
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:25,960
If I'll be really honest with you.

1229
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,880
Just trying to get more than five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten people

1230
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,300
streaming at the same time was probably the hardest part.

1231
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:36,039
If you guys like this, if after this, this is over

1232
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:37,880
and we do all the tours and everyone has a great time,

1233
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,720
then why the fuck I would do it again?

1234
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,409
A hundred percent get different streamers, different people.

1235
01:15:42,409 --> 01:15:44,170
This is just like people that I know.

1236
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:48,000
I obviously would love to open it up to more streamers

1237
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,359
and more content creators and stuff.

1238
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:50,479
That would be a lot of fun.

1239
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:56,760
There were a couple of people that I reached out to that couldn't do it

1240
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,159
that I would love to see what they would do.

1241
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:05,850
There are a couple, there are two or three people that are not here.

1242
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:11,659
So I would love to see what they do.

1243
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:13,340
Expand the torture.

1244
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:28,760
And also to like, I want to like,

1245
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,319
obviously include as many people as I can.

1246
01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:36,170
But I think I told you this yesterday, the day before.

1247
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:40,560
I'm actually pretty, I'm not that well connected on Twitch,

1248
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,560
on YouTube as much as maybe some of you might think I am.

1249
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:47,239
But I would love to open this up to just have more people for sure.

1250
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:57,600
Should I just do the whole house this yellow?

1251
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,920
We're getting, it's getting down to 10 minutes remaining here.

1252
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:10,380
It might be time to change the music.

1253
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:14,029
All right, let's get, let's change the music.

1254
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:18,840
What would be Hell's Kitchen?

1255
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:23,390
Like music?

1256
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:41,930
Ten streamers had exactly 75 minutes to build a house in House Flipper.

1257
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:45,130
Unfortunately, only one of them will get the golden jacket.

1258
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:51,369
We've seen some drama tonight too, as Poke showed up 25 minutes late.

1259
01:17:51,369 --> 01:17:54,619
This is where the part where Poke is in the chair and he's like,

1260
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:56,859
I didn't, I was at the aquarium and I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1261
01:17:56,859 --> 01:17:58,939
I, I, I got a beep on my phone.

1262
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:00,539
I had to get there and I got there pretty fast.

1263
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:06,859
But what we don't understand here is what was happening over on Natalix's stream.

1264
01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:09,739
And like it shows him just like fucking smashing his fucking desk.

1265
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:13,880
I'm not doing this anymore.

1266
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,399
I'm not doing this anymore, Jerma.

1267
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:25,229
Who's getting eliminated?

1268
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:32,329
Nine minutes.

1269
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:42,750
Where's the re-sounds?

1270
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:44,270
Oh, that's true.

1271
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:45,069
They should be here now.

1272
01:18:47,869 --> 01:18:48,590
Yeah, where are they?

1273
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:56,300
Eight minutes before we get everybody in here to ask

1274
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,739
the very important question of how are we going to handle this?

1275
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,369
You should add sound effects.

1276
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:14,989
I like, all right, I'm going to get up like the violin sound.

1277
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,250
Okay, I know what I'm doing for the next 10 minutes.

1278
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,289
Give me a second.

1279
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:50,729
Okay, I got that one.

1280
01:19:50,729 --> 01:19:51,850
I got the theme song.

1281
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,600
Am I going to do this forever?

1282
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,800
This, there's 10 tours I have to do.

1283
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,000
I don't, I can't do this forever.

1284
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,359
Okay, I'll do it for every single one.

1285
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:15,560
I'll do it for every single one.

1286
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,659
At least the first like three.

1287
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:23,800
We've got seven minutes.

1288
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,199
Poke is the only one with a little extra time, but that's all right.

1289
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,039
We do have a schedule of who's going when.

1290
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,619
We're going to have to move the schedule a little

1291
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,579
because Poke was scheduled for 3.20.

1292
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:38,539
But I think we're going to have to move Poke

1293
01:20:38,539 --> 01:20:41,260
because Poke's still going to be, actually, might still make it.

1294
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:45,439
I think he must, this might still be fine.

1295
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:55,479
Okay, any other Hell's Kitchen sound effect?

1296
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:56,680
How many sound effects are there?

1297
01:20:57,609 --> 01:20:58,649
Violin?

1298
01:20:58,649 --> 01:20:59,449
Isn't this the same thing?

1299
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:03,869
It's the same sound, right?

1300
01:21:03,869 --> 01:21:10,640
Yeah, it's the same sound.

1301
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:19,449
There's only one sound effect.

1302
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:22,250
Just put Gordon Ramsay yelling at somebody in the background too.

1303
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:22,970
No, that's too much.

1304
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,760
Need a boom?

1305
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,880
I need like a boom effect?

1306
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,779
Oh, it's this one.

1307
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:47,739
How loud is this?

1308
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:50,510
This is so fucking loud.

1309
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:51,949
I have to turn this way down.

1310
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:59,710
This is at like 0.0 percent.

1311
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,579
Five minutes, almost at the five minute timer.

1312
01:22:10,829 --> 01:22:15,310
Five minutes, five minutes.

1313
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:18,939
All right, how loud is this?

1314
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:22,750
Let's see.

1315
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:23,710
Careful, this might be loud.

1316
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:25,229
I'm just trying to get it through where I can.

1317
01:22:25,229 --> 01:22:28,409
That's really, it's not.

1318
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:29,979
This one, all right, that's good.

1319
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:30,619
Right there is good.

1320
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:34,779
All right, let's get them all together.

1321
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:43,260
So show me what you got here, Talix.

1322
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,579
Well, see, I'm over here and this is my bathroom.

1323
01:22:45,579 --> 01:22:49,159
The bathroom.

1324
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,800
Don't you think it's a little dirty, don't you think?

1325
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,840
They're not, they're not going to be able to hear that.

1326
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:11,720
The boom is too quiet.

1327
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:20,840
We have less than five minutes remaining.

1328
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,159
All right, I got to get my, so there you go.

1329
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:24,359
I'm going to get everything ready.

1330
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:26,680
Let me make sure I have my camera set up, everything set up

1331
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,880
because I'm going to have to be doing through sharing screens

1332
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,600
and let me get that set

1333
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,800
because I want to be able to get right into it.

1334
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,760
So give me one second.

1335
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,960
I will be back.

1336
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,079
You're going to see the screen is going to go black

1337
01:23:38,079 --> 01:24:19,680
and then you'll, I'll be back.

1338
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,039
I think, I actually think I'm good.

1339
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:23,979
I think I'm ready.

1340
01:24:23,979 --> 01:24:25,180
The question is, is everybody?

1341
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:26,060
So we're okay.

1342
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,350
Let me just warn everybody here.

1343
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:29,789
This is a really important warning.

1344
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:33,420
They're all going to get unmuted at the same time

1345
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,500
and everyone's going to be probably complaining

1346
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,180
and like yelling at me and saying like,

1347
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,619
hey, do this, I needed more time.

1348
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:40,619
Like, hey, dude, my house sucks or like, fuck you.

1349
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,100
There's going to be a lot of fighting, I think.

1350
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:47,050
So just be ready for everyone to unmute at the same time.

1351
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:52,010
It's going to be hell on earth here.

1352
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:55,579
Who do you think makes the first complaint?

1353
01:24:55,579 --> 01:24:56,539
Who complains first?

1354
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:01,689
I think that's a good idea to figure that out.

1355
01:25:01,689 --> 01:25:04,569
Who is immediately the first person that we hear

1356
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:17,770
being very mad at me or very upset?

1357
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,329
Give minus 10 points to the person that complains first.

1358
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,909
We have to be very, very attentive to this.

1359
01:25:26,909 --> 01:25:30,699
Minus five points to the person that complains first.

1360
01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:32,619
And not just like, oh, wow, that was so hard.

1361
01:25:32,619 --> 01:25:35,710
I mean like an audible like, like this was annoying.

1362
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:36,189
You know what I mean?

1363
01:25:36,189 --> 01:25:49,789
Like an audible complaint.

1364
01:25:49,789 --> 01:25:51,550
There has to be some care and shit.

1365
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,819
Yeah. Oh yeah.

1366
01:25:53,819 --> 01:25:55,579
Don't, and don't give it away either.

1367
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:58,970
I was going to put it as far as they're great.

1368
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,520
Minus five points from philosophy because of that.

1369
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,930
That's right.

1370
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:04,890
See, you get it.

1371
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:05,689
You get it.

1372
01:26:05,689 --> 01:26:12,489
You understand now.

1373
01:26:12,489 --> 01:26:14,890
One minute is on the clock.

1374
01:26:15,609 --> 01:26:21,930
Now, I'm going to wait to play this

1375
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:23,289
because I want this to play while everyone's freaking out

1376
01:26:23,289 --> 01:26:34,619
and yelling at me.

1377
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:35,979
Final 60 seconds.

1378
01:26:35,979 --> 01:26:36,699
Here it comes.

1379
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:39,229
Count it down.

1380
01:26:51,869 --> 01:26:53,600
What did you say?

1381
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,840
Get the clock ticking sound from 24.

1382
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,079
All right.

1383
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,039
Here we go.

1384
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:02,239
We got to tell everybody pencils down.

1385
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,560
And if you're in their chats, tell them to.

1386
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,239
When I start saying this, tell them to.

1387
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:09,039
We're going on the honor system here besides poke.

1388
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:13,069
Poke is the only one that gets a little extra time.

1389
01:27:13,069 --> 01:27:14,189
So do not do this to poke.

1390
01:27:14,189 --> 01:27:18,569
But everybody else is on the honor system.

1391
01:27:18,569 --> 01:27:19,689
We got 15 seconds.

1392
01:27:19,689 --> 01:27:20,090
Here we go.

1393
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:27,229
Who's cuisine reigns supreme?

1394
01:27:27,229 --> 01:27:29,470
We will find out very shortly.

1395
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:38,140
God, that hurts my head.

1396
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,020
I didn't know it did that.

1397
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,720
Stop. What's going on?

1398
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,279
Who's doing that?

1399
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,960
I'm being like electrocuted.

1400
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,199
Is pencils down?

1401
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:50,760
Pencils down.

1402
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,399
Pencils down.

1403
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:53,239
Oh, we're doing that in the discord to tell everybody.

1404
01:27:53,239 --> 01:27:53,720
All right.

1405
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,520
Pencils are down.

1406
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,239
Pencils are down.

1407
01:27:55,239 --> 01:27:55,880
Pencils are down.

1408
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:56,760
Pencils are down.

1409
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:00,560
I've never been more stressed in my entire life.

1410
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,199
Me too, man.

1411
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,439
This is fucked, Jerma.

1412
01:28:06,439 --> 01:28:12,600
I got to say, I didn't realize how quick 75 minutes was.

1413
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,239
It is pretty quick.

1414
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:15,159
It sounded so long during the prep.

1415
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:16,920
I was like, that's like 10 minutes per room.

1416
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,520
It's like 30 minutes per room.

1417
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,760
From learning the game while doing it.

1418
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,159
Hold on.

1419
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:21,479
Hold on.

1420
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:21,800
Hold on.

1421
01:28:24,039 --> 01:28:25,239
So poke is still going.

1422
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:28,439
Poke has been given special time because poke showed up

1423
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:29,239
30 minutes late.

1424
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:32,220
So poke is still building right now.

1425
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:33,340
He's got about 20 minutes left.

1426
01:28:34,539 --> 01:28:37,710
Let me let me let's let's ask the group.

1427
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:38,670
How are you all doing?

1428
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:43,239
Do you guys want an extra 10 to 15 minutes?

1429
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:44,119
So good.

1430
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:45,880
I'll take an extra five.

1431
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:48,680
Well, poke you are poke you have like an extra almost 25 minutes.

1432
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:50,890
Yeah, you're good.

1433
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:53,050
Use a little bit of time.

1434
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:56,699
No, just to put those final touches on just to make sure it's just right.

1435
01:28:56,699 --> 01:29:00,619
I would actually like no extra time because I think everybody else

1436
01:29:00,619 --> 01:29:06,079
has messed up and I don't think five minutes will help me.

1437
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:07,119
I need like 45.

1438
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:13,659
So I selfishly I selfishly think that the people.

1439
01:29:13,659 --> 01:29:15,659
Yeah, some people could use five to 10.

1440
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:16,220
I couldn't.

1441
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:19,420
I need three hours to be held back by the baddies.

1442
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:20,939
Yes.

1443
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,899
Is it OK if I like went over by two minutes?

1444
01:29:23,899 --> 01:29:24,939
No, definitely not.

1445
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,100
That's minus 10.

1446
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,140
No, it's not allowed.

1447
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:28,779
Poke poke.

1448
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:31,550
If I put German, what if I put your dog in it?

1449
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:33,449
Will that give me two points back?

1450
01:29:33,449 --> 01:29:37,279
I just want time to finish the shrine, you know?

1451
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:37,840
Oh, yeah.

1452
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,960
Well, you know, 75 minutes is 75 minutes.

1453
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,079
We had the confines of the time.

1454
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:44,159
We should play within the time allocated to us.

1455
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,750
You have to remain at the confines of the tortilla.

1456
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:47,229
That's correct.

1457
01:29:47,229 --> 01:29:49,550
The only thing is poke poke poke you poke.

1458
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:52,029
You should get out of here because you have like an extra 20 minutes to build.

1459
01:29:52,029 --> 01:29:52,520
All right.

1460
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,720
I mean, I'm down to take the L.

1461
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:57,420
You just want to take the L.

1462
01:29:58,539 --> 01:30:00,699
I mean, I'm not going to lose, but I mean, I can take the L.

1463
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:01,659
All right.

1464
01:30:01,659 --> 01:30:02,859
You're certainly going to lose.

1465
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:03,800
There's no take.

1466
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,439
You'll see, man.

1467
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:06,489
I got some crazy design.

1468
01:30:06,489 --> 01:30:06,890
All right.

1469
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:07,210
All right.

1470
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:07,529
All right.

1471
01:30:07,529 --> 01:30:09,130
Like minus two, minus two.

1472
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:11,130
You get were you guys as stressed as I was?

1473
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:11,689
Did you ask?

1474
01:30:11,689 --> 01:30:14,010
Oh, yeah, I was miserable day of my life.

1475
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,289
Yeah, miserable.

1476
01:30:15,289 --> 01:30:16,250
God damn.

1477
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,340
It's not easy.

1478
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:18,460
So I'm really happy.

1479
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,060
Everybody had a really good time.

1480
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,340
I'm really glad to hear that.

1481
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,140
That's not what we said.

1482
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:22,859
Great times.

1483
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:23,500
So thank you.

1484
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:24,380
Thank you.

1485
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:25,899
Everybody thought it was fun.

1486
01:30:26,539 --> 01:30:26,779
All right.

1487
01:30:26,779 --> 01:30:27,420
So here we go.

1488
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:28,300
So how's it going to start?

1489
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:29,500
We're going to go to you.

1490
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,180
You all should have the times.

1491
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,579
You feel free to stick around if you want to watch.

1492
01:30:34,539 --> 01:30:36,300
We did some discord testing.

1493
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,180
I am curious.

1494
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,180
So feel free to watch.

1495
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:44,220
But the only thing is it will only be me and the other person in a one on one in this call.

1496
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:46,800
But feel free to react to it and watch what other people did.

1497
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,600
So the first one, Joel, it is you.

1498
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:54,840
So, Joel, if you would if you could turn on your your screen on discord.

1499
01:30:57,310 --> 01:30:57,869
You see this?

1500
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:02,670
Also, if someone needs to go earlier, I'm feeling a little bit better than this morning.

1501
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:07,520
So I can swap if someone needs to get out of here faster.

1502
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,899
We can figure that out in due time for sure.

1503
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:13,020
If anybody wants to swap with italics where he is currently.

1504
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:14,859
I'm chilling.

1505
01:31:14,859 --> 01:31:15,420
Okay.

1506
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,140
Yeah.

1507
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:16,380
All right.

1508
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,340
So let me get out of this because I need to be able to capture this.

1509
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,779
So let's get this started.

1510
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:22,699
So we have about five to seven minutes.

1511
01:31:22,699 --> 01:31:23,739
The times aren't going to be exact.

1512
01:31:23,739 --> 01:31:25,899
I just don't want to I gave us a time constraint

1513
01:31:25,899 --> 01:31:28,539
because I don't want the people at the end of this to be waiting around for like two hours.

1514
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:29,739
So let's get started.

1515
01:31:29,739 --> 01:31:30,619
Joel, you ready?

1516
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:32,380
I am going to open yours up.

1517
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,619
I have your audio through here, too, just to let you know.

1518
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:38,170
So if you're going to play any loud sound effects, let me do this first.

1519
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:40,649
Probably a good idea to quick save for everyone.

1520
01:31:40,649 --> 01:31:41,369
It is.

1521
01:31:41,369 --> 01:31:42,569
How do you how do you do that?

1522
01:31:42,569 --> 01:31:44,010
Yeah, I'll do you quick.

1523
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:46,720
All that for Joel.

1524
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:49,439
Oh, no, don't don't do that.

1525
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:53,800
Don't do that.

1526
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,319
How do you actually quick save it?

1527
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:02,199
Okay, we are ready, Joel.

1528
01:32:02,199 --> 01:32:03,640
Hold on one more second.

1529
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,960
I want to make sure I can see everything that you're doing.

1530
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,430
I'm going to try to go to German stream chat.

1531
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:10,329
Okay.

1532
01:32:10,329 --> 01:32:12,010
So this is Joel's view.

1533
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:13,640
Yes.

1534
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,880
Let me make sure I can see your whole entire thing.

1535
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:19,000
Hold on.

1536
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,600
I got to get it in the frame.

1537
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,470
Okay.

1538
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:23,949
Hold on.

1539
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,439
Let me just exit my game so I can hear this better.

1540
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:32,880
I can get rid of the timer as well.

1541
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,680
I can hear like somebody swearing.

1542
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,000
No, don't worry about that.

1543
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,800
Don't worry about that.

1544
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,039
No.

1545
01:32:44,029 --> 01:32:45,149
Okay, move this.

1546
01:32:46,029 --> 01:32:47,310
I'm going to get out of my game.

1547
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:49,130
Okay.

1548
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:50,619
Okay.

1549
01:32:51,579 --> 01:32:52,380
You can begin.

1550
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,380
You can begin your tour.

1551
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:56,399
I am here and I'm ready.

1552
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:57,920
Okay, Jeremiah.

1553
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,680
So the extensive cleanup that I did of this.

1554
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,880
First of all, before we go into the house,

1555
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,560
I'm going to make sure that you see all of my nice cleanup that I did.

1556
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,520
There's no trash.

1557
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,880
There's nothing going on here.

1558
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:09,119
Okay.

1559
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:11,680
And as you can see, it's all pretty damn good.

1560
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,250
You know, and don't worry about that, but whatever.

1561
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:18,489
So my point is I did a lot here to make sure this was going to be percentable and good.

1562
01:33:18,489 --> 01:33:21,850
Now, first thing you're going to see is a crime scene yellow tape.

1563
01:33:22,649 --> 01:33:23,289
That doesn't matter.

1564
01:33:23,289 --> 01:33:25,529
Joel, could you just stand still for one second?

1565
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:29,279
Because the bit rate, your bit rate is phenomenal.

1566
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:30,000
Oh, really?

1567
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,159
Yeah.

1568
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:33,600
Well, you're going to have to go to each room and freeze for like five seconds.

1569
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:33,920
Okay.

1570
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,239
Okay.

1571
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:34,720
Okay.

1572
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,319
But everything could lower the FPS too.

1573
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:37,760
That can help sometimes.

1574
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,159
If you're like running native, the bit rate kind of suffers.

1575
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:43,079
So a lower FPS streaming helps.

1576
01:33:49,449 --> 01:33:50,810
You can always just watch my stream.

1577
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:54,010
I'm also streaming on my channel if you want to pull that up too.

1578
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:57,229
But this is one to one so I can actually react with you.

1579
01:33:57,229 --> 01:33:58,909
I think it's actually good now.

1580
01:33:58,909 --> 01:33:59,149
All right.

1581
01:33:59,149 --> 01:33:59,869
Did you make a change?

1582
01:33:59,869 --> 01:34:00,939
Good.

1583
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:02,460
No, it's all the same.

1584
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:03,100
Oh, okay.

1585
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:03,899
I think it looks all right.

1586
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:04,699
Okay.

1587
01:34:04,699 --> 01:34:05,100
Okay.

1588
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:05,899
You ready?

1589
01:34:05,899 --> 01:34:07,239
I'm ready.

1590
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:07,800
Okay.

1591
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:10,359
So you see the yellow tape that says crime scene do not cross.

1592
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:11,319
Don't worry about it.

1593
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:11,880
Okay.

1594
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,319
Now, what I did here is I made sure that even though my house is floss,

1595
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:18,829
I made sure to point them out to kind of get a bit of a, you know,

1596
01:34:18,829 --> 01:34:21,869
like be aware there are some issues here since a trip password in here.

1597
01:34:21,869 --> 01:34:22,270
Sure.

1598
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:24,109
Now, as you watch the bathroom here,

1599
01:34:24,109 --> 01:34:28,189
I did an interior decorating here that shows that I got a sense of humor

1600
01:34:28,189 --> 01:34:31,560
in the, you know, face of terror.

1601
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:34,760
So I didn't install a toilet, but I installed a hole here instead.

1602
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:35,079
Okay.

1603
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:36,600
Or a bucket if you prefer.

1604
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:41,390
I installed a poop knife for the willing and a plate of brownies.

1605
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:44,510
Now, if you might notice, there's a picture of William the foe looking at you.

1606
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:46,750
Yeah, I was going to ask you about that.

1607
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:51,500
There's only to encourage, you know, fecal content.

1608
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:57,020
But as you can see, yes to that, no to that, you know, be careful, be aware.

1609
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:01,420
So that on the right, that's somebody defecating is what I'm being,

1610
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:04,220
is that what that is?

1611
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:06,079
No, it's art.

1612
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:10,159
Anyway, anyway, that's a bathroom and it's a big window out here,

1613
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:13,659
but you own this entire area, so it should be fine.

1614
01:35:13,659 --> 01:35:17,659
Anyway, that's a bathroom, you know, and in here,

1615
01:35:17,659 --> 01:35:20,460
I made it make sure to do a little thematic thing here.

1616
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:23,020
As you can see, there's an alien in here and you go in here

1617
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:25,100
and you notice, wow, there's a lot of going on.

1618
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,199
There's a bit of a sci-fi theme.

1619
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:28,159
There's a UFO in the ceiling.

1620
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:29,279
Sci-fi theme.

1621
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:34,810
Yes, but check this out.

1622
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:35,529
Oh, all right.

1623
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:36,649
I like it.

1624
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:38,810
I like the, I like the radio.

1625
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:39,760
Yeah.

1626
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,640
What is on the radio?

1627
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,520
I don't like aliens.

1628
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,689
I don't like aliens.

1629
01:35:43,689 --> 01:35:46,250
So, you know, say no to alien abduction.

1630
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,850
There's a little cow being abducted.

1631
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,369
There's some corn for the alien.

1632
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:52,720
And as you can see here, there's the guy from Toy Story, Gary.

1633
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:58,409
And you know, I got a little Gleeby Deeby guy and a toilet too.

1634
01:35:58,409 --> 01:36:01,770
But this is going to be playing throughout your house tour

1635
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:02,810
and going to irritate you.

1636
01:36:03,369 --> 01:36:08,479
So I'm basically telling you that if you're impervious to migraines,

1637
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:09,119
this is great.

1638
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:11,359
But if you're not, then, you know, whatever.

1639
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:13,520
But anyway, that's just the bottom floor here.

1640
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,119
Now, I want to guide you out of here

1641
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,689
because I have something very, very good for you.

1642
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,600
Now, there's two options here.

1643
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:25,680
You can check out the Amazing Maze or the hidden Green Gobbler Room.

1644
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,239
Can we, can we go to the PlayStation 1 Green Gobbler Room?

1645
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:30,880
You got it.

1646
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,079
There's the Green Gobbler.

1647
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:34,970
And as you can see, picture Willem Dafoe.

1648
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:35,850
You go in here.

1649
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:36,170
Whoa!

1650
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:39,119
There's a little shrine dedicated to the man.

1651
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:43,600
So as you all heard, Jerma Chat, Willem, William.

1652
01:36:45,069 --> 01:36:46,029
It's, oh, fuck, I fucked up.

1653
01:36:46,029 --> 01:36:47,069
It was supposed to be Willem.

1654
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:51,710
Is that, what is, is that, is that Jack Nicholson up there?

1655
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:53,149
No, that's Willem Dafoe.

1656
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:54,590
Anyway, he died this year.

1657
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:56,750
And I want to make sure that everybody remembers.

1658
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:58,109
He died of gas.

1659
01:36:58,109 --> 01:37:00,890
So over here, there's the poisonous gas storage

1660
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:03,210
where Willem Dafoe was turned into the Green Goblin.

1661
01:37:04,409 --> 01:37:09,399
There's an air conditioning unit here that lets you smoke the gas

1662
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:12,119
to turn into Spider-Man.

1663
01:37:13,630 --> 01:37:16,029
You and I, we're not too different, Spider-Man.

1664
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:18,189
I'm putting down a complexity grade here.

1665
01:37:20,189 --> 01:37:23,600
What I enjoy, let me stop you for one second.

1666
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,600
I do very much enjoy the Green Goblin room.

1667
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,279
I think it was a very good creative choice.

1668
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:32,560
What I'm very, I think I'm upset with here is the fact

1669
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,319
that that's Jack Nicholson's picture up there,

1670
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:36,239
not actually Willem Dafoe.

1671
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:38,159
And over on the right there, that's,

1672
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,319
can you get in close to that, please?

1673
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:40,960
Yeah, that picture there.

1674
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,199
This?

1675
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:41,600
Yeah.

1676
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,439
Just get in real close and just stand still for a second

1677
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:44,800
because I want people to be able to see this

1678
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,239
as it offers a little bit here.

1679
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:48,810
Yeah, that's, I'm going to give you a little bit of points

1680
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:50,329
deducted from that because this is one of my least

1681
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:51,689
favorite images on the internet.

1682
01:37:51,689 --> 01:37:53,770
So I'm going to deduct a few points for you from that one

1683
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:56,010
for your philosophy.

1684
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:58,909
I do like the vision.

1685
01:37:58,909 --> 01:38:00,189
I'm a big fan of the vision.

1686
01:38:00,189 --> 01:38:07,130
Anyway, we've seen it.

1687
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:09,079
I'll take it.

1688
01:38:09,079 --> 01:38:12,159
So you can see here, there's the gas from there.

1689
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,840
And once you've ingested the gas,

1690
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,960
the mask starts talking to you

1691
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,340
and you can stand in front of the mirror and it goes,

1692
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:20,859
you know, Spider-Man.

1693
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:26,699
So the entire green goblin room.

1694
01:38:26,699 --> 01:38:27,420
Yeah.

1695
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,550
All right.

1696
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:33,039
I think it's how much more of your house is there?

1697
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:34,399
Uh, a little bit.

1698
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:35,600
There's just two areas left.

1699
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:35,840
Okay.

1700
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:36,640
Quickly show off.

1701
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:38,560
So that's a green gobbler.

1702
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:39,680
I like it.

1703
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,880
Want to show this off?

1704
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,210
Put a little reference to, uh,

1705
01:38:45,289 --> 01:38:46,250
I don't have any.

1706
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,529
Please don't deduct points.

1707
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:50,729
I don't, I don't know what it is.

1708
01:38:50,729 --> 01:38:54,810
The pixels are trying so hard to put that image on the screen.

1709
01:38:55,369 --> 01:38:55,770
It looks.

1710
01:38:56,409 --> 01:38:56,729
Whoa.

1711
01:38:56,729 --> 01:38:58,329
That just like actually scared me.

1712
01:38:58,329 --> 01:38:59,609
There's another person behind me.

1713
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:03,340
Can I interrupt real quick?

1714
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:06,560
If we made it daytime, it probably would have helped.

1715
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,000
That's true.

1716
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,039
How do I do that?

1717
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:11,680
Uh, if you exit and reenter, yes, leave it a bed.

1718
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,960
I don't have a bed.

1719
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,720
I think it's also because you are technically sharing from, uh,

1720
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:17,680
from across the world.

1721
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:21,340
I think that's another reason, but we know we can see it.

1722
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:23,630
Burnt post maybe.

1723
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:24,750
Okay.

1724
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,550
Just checking.

1725
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:28,189
Can we just listen to the audio for a second?

1726
01:39:28,189 --> 01:39:29,069
I just, can I get just into,

1727
01:39:29,789 --> 01:39:33,149
this is going to be a part of your grade because philosophy,

1728
01:39:33,149 --> 01:39:35,689
um, yeah, I want to turn your volume up.

1729
01:39:35,689 --> 01:39:37,130
I want to hear that.

1730
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:51,550
Listening to that.

1731
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:52,510
I think I got it.

1732
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:53,229
Yeah, I got it.

1733
01:39:53,229 --> 01:39:53,789
Okay.

1734
01:39:53,789 --> 01:39:54,989
Anyway, quick thing here.

1735
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,109
We had some problems.

1736
01:39:56,109 --> 01:39:59,710
Uh, somebody died, but it's okay because, you know, life and death

1737
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:01,149
is kind of synonymous with each other.

1738
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:04,350
And through death, life comes.

1739
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:06,350
So we're growing corn here from it.

1740
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:08,270
Oh, a garden actually garden.

1741
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:09,069
Okay.

1742
01:40:09,949 --> 01:40:10,430
Yes.

1743
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:11,869
And we, it's also solar powered.

1744
01:40:11,869 --> 01:40:14,640
So it's, you know, it's environmentally.

1745
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,279
Healthy.

1746
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:15,600
Okay.

1747
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,560
But anyway, speaking of gardens, I made sure to include a little

1748
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,560
puzzle because we all like mind puzzles, right?

1749
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:23,119
So here's the amazing thing.

1750
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:23,279
All right.

1751
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:24,880
Wait, wait, can you, can you actually sleep?

1752
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,399
Can you like reset your game?

1753
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:28,159
Like just go to a different house and come back to this one.

1754
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:28,399
All right.

1755
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:30,800
So just go to back to your office and then come back to this house.

1756
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,079
Make this your office.

1757
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:33,369
Make office here.

1758
01:40:33,369 --> 01:40:36,829
No, yeah, make, make this your office.

1759
01:40:36,829 --> 01:40:37,149
Yeah.

1760
01:40:37,149 --> 01:40:38,189
Move office here.

1761
01:40:38,189 --> 01:40:38,430
Yep.

1762
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:39,819
Move office here.

1763
01:40:39,819 --> 01:40:40,140
Okay.

1764
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:41,630
Put the computer down.

1765
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:43,229
Now go just leave here and come back.

1766
01:40:43,229 --> 01:40:46,029
Because I think we'll fix some of the vision problems that way.

1767
01:40:46,029 --> 01:40:47,770
Main menu.

1768
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:48,090
Yep.

1769
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:52,159
Just, and just come right back in or just like, yeah, just go to the computer.

1770
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:52,319
Yeah.

1771
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:53,680
Just reload it.

1772
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,960
Reload it and then continue game.

1773
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,199
Yeah.

1774
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:56,239
You should be good to go.

1775
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:56,829
Okay.

1776
01:40:56,829 --> 01:40:57,069
Okay.

1777
01:40:57,069 --> 01:40:57,229
Okay.

1778
01:40:57,229 --> 01:40:57,630
Gotcha.

1779
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:57,789
Gotcha.

1780
01:40:57,789 --> 01:40:59,310
Gotcha.

1781
01:40:59,310 --> 01:40:59,949
Don't worry chat.

1782
01:40:59,949 --> 01:41:01,609
I made sure to save.

1783
01:41:01,609 --> 01:41:06,649
Well, also you could on Joel's stream too, has like the HQ high quality version.

1784
01:41:06,649 --> 01:41:10,880
So I can still get, I can still see what you're doing.

1785
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,329
Watch the game crash now.

1786
01:41:16,329 --> 01:41:17,319
No, we're good.

1787
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,119
All right.

1788
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:19,960
So back over here.

1789
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,279
Okay.

1790
01:41:20,279 --> 01:41:24,039
As you can see, laptop, the statement you missed, kind of.

1791
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:27,340
I can, I can, I see, I see the, I see the vision.

1792
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:27,979
I see the vision.

1793
01:41:28,619 --> 01:41:28,859
Okay.

1794
01:41:28,859 --> 01:41:29,500
Cool.

1795
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,539
So we're going to move on here.

1796
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,220
And this is the, this is the amazing maze, by the way, right?

1797
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,899
It's all the grass, but I, you know, I'm going to open your stream.

1798
01:41:38,779 --> 01:41:39,180
Okay.

1799
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:39,819
Yeah.

1800
01:41:39,819 --> 01:41:43,369
And you're like, my God, I have solved the maze.

1801
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:44,250
Okay.

1802
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:46,649
Jerma, Jerma, this is for you, buddy.

1803
01:41:46,649 --> 01:41:48,729
Cause I know someone has a special day coming up.

1804
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:50,409
You've solved the maze.

1805
01:41:50,409 --> 01:41:56,250
You've done the brain puzzle and ladies and gentlemen, happy birthday, Jeremy, happy 60th.

1806
01:41:56,970 --> 01:41:58,489
We are so proud of you, buddy.

1807
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,279
Hey, have a racing cake.

1808
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:02,760
Thank you.

1809
01:42:03,479 --> 01:42:06,970
It is my birthday in months and months from now.

1810
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:09,399
I really appreciate it.

1811
01:42:09,399 --> 01:42:09,960
That's right.

1812
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,319
Oh, that's it.

1813
01:42:11,319 --> 01:42:14,359
And that's not how tall I am, but you're getting points removed for creativity for that one.

1814
01:42:14,359 --> 01:42:19,079
Because the short joke is I think, well, 60th birthday, well on its way out by now.

1815
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:22,140
We are so proud of you.

1816
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:27,920
But anyway, yeah, this is a little maze that leads to your personal pleasure zone.

1817
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:28,720
Okay.

1818
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:29,760
All right.

1819
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,520
Wait, wait, wait, go, go back to the table for a second.

1820
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:34,350
And what, what is this?

1821
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:35,390
This is a, this is a cake.

1822
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:37,760
This is a little racing cake, buddy.

1823
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:39,439
You like racing cakes.

1824
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:40,399
Okay.

1825
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:45,529
I actually, I'm going to, I'm going to pull you back a few points on,

1826
01:42:46,909 --> 01:42:48,909
I'm going to pull you back a few points on philosophy on this one,

1827
01:42:48,909 --> 01:42:50,909
because I actually don't really like raisins that much at all.

1828
01:42:52,729 --> 01:42:54,729
So that's, that's a blunder.

1829
01:42:54,729 --> 01:42:56,489
You like the spider though, right?

1830
01:42:56,489 --> 01:42:59,289
The spider is cool, but the raisins, I'm not a, I'm not a big fan of raisins.

1831
01:42:59,289 --> 01:43:01,130
Well, thanks for reinstating all my points, buddy.

1832
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:04,220
You're my friend.

1833
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:08,060
I cannot wait to go back and watch you do this.

1834
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:08,380
Okay.

1835
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:11,260
So we have a final area here.

1836
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:12,060
Wait, there's another area.

1837
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:12,300
Okay.

1838
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:12,619
All right.

1839
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:12,859
Yeah.

1840
01:43:12,859 --> 01:43:13,180
More, more, more.

1841
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:18,800
There's a final area here that I want to show off, because Jerma, you like Twister?

1842
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,279
You know, timeless game, right?

1843
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:21,920
Twister, which game?

1844
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,359
Do you like wall Twister?

1845
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:23,760
Yeah.

1846
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,039
I guess it would, yeah.

1847
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:27,359
You figure this shit out because I ran out of time.

1848
01:43:27,359 --> 01:43:29,899
Anyway, as you can see, look at that.

1849
01:43:29,899 --> 01:43:31,850
Otto!

1850
01:43:31,850 --> 01:43:33,210
That's right.

1851
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:35,930
Please give me 10 points for being so caring as a friend.

1852
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:39,210
Anybody that has Otto in their house gets an extra two or three points,

1853
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:41,130
at least on every category.

1854
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:42,329
That's right.

1855
01:43:42,329 --> 01:43:45,369
And I put some Bop-Its in because, you know, I'm sure you like Bop-Its.

1856
01:43:45,369 --> 01:43:47,260
These are real Bop-Its, by the way.

1857
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:47,979
What is to the right?

1858
01:43:47,979 --> 01:43:48,460
What is down there?

1859
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:49,819
Is that like an air conditioner?

1860
01:43:50,619 --> 01:43:55,149
That's a printer because we all like to print shit.

1861
01:43:55,149 --> 01:43:56,750
You know what's wicked funny?

1862
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:59,149
My printer's actually on the ground like that.

1863
01:43:59,149 --> 01:44:01,390
And you get points, you get points for creativity for that one.

1864
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:01,949
All right.

1865
01:44:01,949 --> 01:44:04,829
My printer is actually on the ground just like that.

1866
01:44:04,829 --> 01:44:06,119
OK.

1867
01:44:06,119 --> 01:44:06,920
Now, I could prove it.

1868
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:07,000
Check this out.

1869
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,060
There's a bunch of spi...

1870
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:08,859
Oh, oh my God.

1871
01:44:08,859 --> 01:44:09,579
OK, there we go.

1872
01:44:09,579 --> 01:44:12,060
A bunch of spiders in the ceiling, but don't worry.

1873
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:14,859
The spider infestation problem is mostly resolved.

1874
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:18,859
Cleanliness.

1875
01:44:18,859 --> 01:44:20,380
Well, don't worry about that, Jerma,

1876
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:22,060
because we're about to go a little meta here.

1877
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:22,760
OK?

1878
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,079
Ready?

1879
01:44:24,119 --> 01:44:28,079
Ladies and gentlemen, beware of the Boggler.

1880
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:30,569
And there's a little star reference there.

1881
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:31,930
So, you know.

1882
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:32,810
He's not here.

1883
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:37,229
Doesn't matter because, Jerma, it's your streamer room.

1884
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:41,279
You got your reddish shelf over here.

1885
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:42,560
You know, check that out.

1886
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,359
You got your whole thing.

1887
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:45,680
You're eating a chicken egg, a tomato.

1888
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:48,319
And you love that kefir.

1889
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:48,720
Sorry.

1890
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,119
Sorry, dude.

1891
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:49,600
Tomatoes.

1892
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:49,920
I'm sorry.

1893
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,159
That's...

1894
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,079
Yeah, but whatever.

1895
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:52,479
That's fine.

1896
01:44:52,479 --> 01:44:53,279
But check this out.

1897
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,840
It's nice milk.

1898
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,439
And there's a big milk bucket.

1899
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:00,560
And as you can see on the floor, it's infested with rats.

1900
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,920
Friendly rats, mind you.

1901
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,039
OK, they look...

1902
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:03,439
That's cool.

1903
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:04,000
What's that poster?

1904
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,159
Can you get in close and just re-sperm it on there for a second?

1905
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:06,960
This is the...

1906
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:07,920
This is the flavors.

1907
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:08,720
What's your flavor?

1908
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,560
You are a gamer.

1909
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,319
So, you like Seeds of Victory.

1910
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,479
Cashews of Chaos.

1911
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:15,199
Cashews, no.

1912
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:16,720
Nuts of Destruction.

1913
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,319
Definitely not cashews, for sure.

1914
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:19,720
What's that one?

1915
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,149
Gamer snacks?

1916
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:22,590
Gourmet trail mix.

1917
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:24,890
I actually don't eat very many gamer snacks,

1918
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:26,729
but I do appreciate the fact that you're trying to make people...

1919
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:27,689
Like and subscribe.

1920
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:29,920
Well, you can't do that on Twitch.

1921
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,479
And I pretty much only predominantly use Twitch.

1922
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:34,399
And that's minus points for complexity

1923
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:37,439
because my spine looked a little weird there.

1924
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:40,319
Try to get your room right then.

1925
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:41,600
It's a one-one recreation.

1926
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:46,829
Now, we are on to the last room here of the tour, everybody.

1927
01:45:46,829 --> 01:45:49,630
So, I wanted to have a theme, various themes here.

1928
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:52,829
And one of them was an OSHA violation.

1929
01:45:52,829 --> 01:45:55,949
So, as you can see, OSHA top 10 violations.

1930
01:45:55,949 --> 01:45:58,010
We're going to be cooking guns

1931
01:45:58,010 --> 01:45:59,609
and we're going to be using a sink here

1932
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:02,729
and enjoy this sink drink.

1933
01:46:02,729 --> 01:46:07,050
Are those plenty of sharpies?

1934
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:07,850
What's on the ground?

1935
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:09,479
What's all over the ground?

1936
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:10,600
Are those propane tanks?

1937
01:46:11,399 --> 01:46:12,199
Explosives?

1938
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:13,640
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1939
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,890
Okay.

1940
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:15,770
Well, as you can see,

1941
01:46:16,569 --> 01:46:17,770
there's some accidents here,

1942
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:19,609
but we've got shotguns.

1943
01:46:19,609 --> 01:46:20,970
There's a toxic hazard.

1944
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:23,369
There's a chocolate and eggs being cooked up too.

1945
01:46:23,369 --> 01:46:24,090
Chocolate and eggs.

1946
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:24,810
And here's where it gets...

1947
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:26,510
Yeah, it's good.

1948
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:27,789
But here's where it gets interesting

1949
01:46:27,789 --> 01:46:29,949
because there's not only explosives,

1950
01:46:29,949 --> 01:46:30,670
it's radioactive.

1951
01:46:30,670 --> 01:46:31,550
It's radioactive.

1952
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:34,189
And to really sell this house home,

1953
01:46:34,189 --> 01:46:35,710
Jeremiah, I just want to tell you one thing.

1954
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:39,229
What's better than a baby with a gun

1955
01:46:39,229 --> 01:46:42,029
and peace near a fireplace with explosives?

1956
01:46:42,029 --> 01:46:45,899
I think there are quite a few things

1957
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,340
that would be better than that.

1958
01:46:47,579 --> 01:46:50,460
I think philosophy might have to take

1959
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:53,020
a little bit of a nosedive on this one

1960
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:54,779
just because that's very dangerous.

1961
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:57,579
And there's also somebody's

1962
01:46:57,579 --> 01:46:59,340
severed limb over there as well, I believe.

1963
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:01,369
Is that somebody?

1964
01:47:01,369 --> 01:47:02,010
It's good, right?

1965
01:47:04,409 --> 01:47:05,689
I mean, if it's dangerous,

1966
01:47:05,689 --> 01:47:06,810
I don't know if good would be the answer,

1967
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:08,489
but dangerous is definitely up there.

1968
01:47:08,489 --> 01:47:09,850
But you could put points for creativity.

1969
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:11,289
Dangerously fun.

1970
01:47:11,289 --> 01:47:12,250
I see.

1971
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:12,729
I'm feeling you.

1972
01:47:12,729 --> 01:47:13,899
I feel you.

1973
01:47:13,899 --> 01:47:14,380
Okay.

1974
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:17,949
I think I'm ready to grade you.

1975
01:47:17,949 --> 01:47:18,430
Okay.

1976
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:20,159
I think I'm ready.

1977
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:20,560
Remember.

1978
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:22,539
Remember.

1979
01:47:22,539 --> 01:47:22,859
Remember.

1980
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:24,539
Happy 60th.

1981
01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:26,970
We are going to go for creativity.

1982
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:28,970
Joel, I think you actually did a lot.

1983
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:31,609
There was a lot of time and placement

1984
01:47:31,609 --> 01:47:33,079
that went into this.

1985
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:36,920
I'm going to give you, for creativity,

1986
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:39,449
I'm going to give you,

1987
01:47:39,449 --> 01:47:41,130
because of the amount of objects

1988
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:42,090
that you placed,

1989
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:44,569
the amount of individual objects

1990
01:47:44,569 --> 01:47:45,529
that had to be physically placed,

1991
01:47:45,529 --> 01:47:50,270
you're going to get a 94 for your creativity.

1992
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:51,039
Okay.

1993
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:52,960
94 for creativity.

1994
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,399
I think you actually did quite a lot.

1995
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:57,229
I think it was very, very wonderful.

1996
01:47:57,229 --> 01:47:58,829
I think you did a lot of good placement.

1997
01:47:59,149 --> 01:47:59,789
I love the corn.

1998
01:47:59,789 --> 01:48:01,149
I like the fact that you actually did a garden.

1999
01:48:01,789 --> 01:48:04,270
Your complexity is also going to be a little bit high

2000
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:05,550
because your complexity is in...

2001
01:48:07,229 --> 01:48:09,390
There was a full thought-out maze

2002
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:10,350
part of this house,

2003
01:48:10,909 --> 01:48:12,430
which gives you some points.

2004
01:48:13,319 --> 01:48:14,680
The complexity of, you know,

2005
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,439
Jerma's not as tall as his door,

2006
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:17,960
I mean, and like, you know,

2007
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,520
Green Goblin, it's not that complex.

2008
01:48:21,479 --> 01:48:22,279
I do appreciate the fact

2009
01:48:22,279 --> 01:48:23,800
that you did put a gnome next to that

2010
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,319
to be able to show that I am, in fact,

2011
01:48:25,319 --> 01:48:27,800
over, you know, more than four feet tall.

2012
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:28,760
That's unrelated.

2013
01:48:29,399 --> 01:48:30,199
This is unrelated.

2014
01:48:30,199 --> 01:48:31,560
And if you feel that way,

2015
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,239
that's not deductible on points.

2016
01:48:33,239 --> 01:48:34,520
I'm going to give you an 80.

2017
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:35,479
I'm going to give you an 82

2018
01:48:36,039 --> 01:48:38,300
on complexity and structure.

2019
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:39,260
I think it was still good.

2020
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:41,770
I think you get an 82 on that.

2021
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:42,569
That's a solid B.

2022
01:48:42,569 --> 01:48:44,010
That's a solid B minus.

2023
01:48:44,569 --> 01:48:47,159
Your cleanliness was very good.

2024
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:48,199
I don't see any trash in the yard.

2025
01:48:48,199 --> 01:48:49,079
Could you do me a quick favor, though?

2026
01:48:49,079 --> 01:48:50,279
Could you go to where the...

2027
01:48:51,710 --> 01:48:52,590
Go to where the...

2028
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:53,310
Where's the garage?

2029
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,079
Like the actual garage.

2030
01:48:57,079 --> 01:48:58,920
Yeah, I need like the garage

2031
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,439
because I need you to go to the left of the garage.

2032
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:01,560
No, actually, no, that's clear.

2033
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,060
That's clear.

2034
01:49:03,069 --> 01:49:04,829
The spiders are going to take some points off,

2035
01:49:04,829 --> 01:49:06,350
unfortunately, because it's, you know,

2036
01:49:07,390 --> 01:49:08,829
you didn't clean that up beforehand.

2037
01:49:08,829 --> 01:49:12,270
Also, I think that having explosives everywhere

2038
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:14,189
could be very dangerous and make a big mess.

2039
01:49:14,189 --> 01:49:17,050
I'm going to have to give you a 75 on cleanliness.

2040
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:17,550
Okay.

2041
01:49:18,489 --> 01:49:19,609
I think that's a solid C,

2042
01:49:19,609 --> 01:49:21,130
considering that there were spiders everywhere.

2043
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:22,760
There were rats everywhere.

2044
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,760
It's not very clean, necessarily.

2045
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,039
I mean, it's pretty complex.

2046
01:49:26,039 --> 01:49:27,159
It's pretty creative.

2047
01:49:27,159 --> 01:49:29,159
But I'm going to give you a 75 on cleanliness.

2048
01:49:29,159 --> 01:49:31,359
I'll take that.

2049
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:32,479
Your philosophy and theming,

2050
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:36,079
I'm going to give you an 86.

2051
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:38,670
I think you deserve an 86.

2052
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:40,350
I think that was a solid B.

2053
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:43,310
Well, I'll give you...

2054
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:45,390
I'm going to give you a 90, actually,

2055
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:48,029
because you did have a pretty good theme here.

2056
01:49:48,029 --> 01:49:50,829
As much as I, you know, the Green Goblin,

2057
01:49:50,829 --> 01:49:51,470
you had a pretty good theme.

2058
01:49:52,029 --> 01:49:53,310
All right, it's time for Chat's grade.

2059
01:49:54,829 --> 01:49:56,430
Chat, what is your grade?

2060
01:49:57,159 --> 01:49:57,960
You have to pick...

2061
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:02,600
It has to be 95, 85, 75, 65.

2062
01:50:04,029 --> 01:50:05,149
Those are your choices.

2063
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:07,359
Joel, I think you did a hell of a job.

2064
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,520
Those of you that opened up Joel's stream

2065
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,039
would have seen the high quality version.

2066
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:12,960
We got to see a good PlayStation 2 version,

2067
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,159
which I think actually added to it.

2068
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:16,880
So that's why I gave you more points for creativity.

2069
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,949
And I think we can see what they want to do.

2070
01:50:19,949 --> 01:50:20,989
Can we get the poll going?

2071
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:29,210
Adding your own audio track is a huge deal.

2072
01:50:30,569 --> 01:50:32,970
Your own audio track in the game?

2073
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:34,409
That's how you got a 94 on creativity.

2074
01:50:35,819 --> 01:50:38,569
What do we got?

2075
01:50:38,569 --> 01:50:41,399
What does Chat want to give you?

2076
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:43,319
Wow, Chat is saying A.

2077
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:45,319
95 from Chat for Joel.

2078
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:48,010
Joel, that brings your total grade.

2079
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:50,319
That is worth 10% of your total grade.

2080
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:54,960
Joel, you are at an 87.6 is your final grade.

2081
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,159
That's a B plus.

2082
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:59,529
Okay.

2083
01:50:59,529 --> 01:51:01,369
That's a B plus for Joel.

2084
01:51:01,369 --> 01:51:02,939
Okay.

2085
01:51:02,939 --> 01:51:05,340
87.6 for Joel.

2086
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:07,260
I just want to let you all know

2087
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,579
that I'm very happy to be part of this,

2088
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:13,579
you know, opportunity to show off

2089
01:51:13,579 --> 01:51:15,579
and not necessarily show off

2090
01:51:15,579 --> 01:51:19,180
in a sort of, you know, narcissistic way,

2091
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:21,180
but rather, you know, show everybody

2092
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:23,100
that my hard drive is running out of space

2093
01:51:23,739 --> 01:51:25,979
for some reason anyway, whatever.

2094
01:51:25,979 --> 01:51:29,579
My point is I worked really hard on this

2095
01:51:29,579 --> 01:51:34,670
and I think it's pretty good according to you guys,

2096
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:35,949
which makes me very happy.

2097
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:39,470
But this was my little attempt at making a house here

2098
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:42,670
and I can't wait to see what everybody else has done

2099
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:44,350
because I mean, there's so many people,

2100
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:46,029
there's so many talented people

2101
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:47,470
and I guarantee you this,

2102
01:51:49,659 --> 01:51:51,340
if you think mine is the best,

2103
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:53,260
that's not going to be the case because, you know.

2104
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,159
Well, we'll see.

2105
01:51:55,159 --> 01:51:55,960
Yeah, we'll see.

2106
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,840
We'll see.

2107
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:58,680
But I just want to thank you all for, you know,

2108
01:51:58,680 --> 01:51:59,800
looking at my house

2109
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:02,699
and I want to thank the Boogler himself

2110
01:52:02,699 --> 01:52:04,760
for giving such a high, high ranking.

2111
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,600
Honestly, the lower bit rate actually added to it for me.

2112
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,640
It really did.

2113
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:12,460
Oh yeah.

2114
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,420
Thanks a lot, Joel.

2115
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:14,300
Joel, it was a pleasure.

2116
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,619
Thank you for showing your house.

2117
01:52:16,619 --> 01:52:17,739
It was phenomenal.

2118
01:52:17,739 --> 01:52:19,100
Everybody say thank you to Joel.

2119
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:21,739
I hope you had fun.

2120
01:52:21,739 --> 01:52:22,460
Thank you, guys.

2121
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:23,180
Coming up, we have...

2122
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,340
Yeah, but if we want to talk,

2123
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:27,340
if anybody want to say anything about Joel's house

2124
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:28,460
before we move on to Seedog.

2125
01:52:30,489 --> 01:52:32,970
Is anyone else going to get the points benefit

2126
01:52:32,970 --> 01:52:35,850
for PS2 graphics in the Discord preview?

2127
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:40,109
His house is perfect for the PS2 graphics though.

2128
01:52:40,109 --> 01:52:40,750
It really is.

2129
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,270
It couldn't have worked better.

2130
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:43,229
I think that's why...

2131
01:52:44,359 --> 01:52:45,239
Walls?

2132
01:52:45,239 --> 01:52:45,880
Wait, what do you say?

2133
01:52:47,229 --> 01:52:47,869
Nothing.

2134
01:52:47,869 --> 01:52:50,510
I just spent most of my time painting the outside of my house

2135
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,350
and I realized I should have just put in...

2136
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:53,630
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2137
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:54,670
Lud, Lud, Lud, I...

2138
01:52:56,029 --> 01:52:56,989
I'm a stupid idiot.

2139
01:52:56,989 --> 01:52:58,109
I'm a stupid idiot.

2140
01:52:58,109 --> 01:52:58,829
Lud, listen.

2141
01:52:58,829 --> 01:53:00,829
I used the paint gun and I grappled too, Connor.

2142
01:53:00,829 --> 01:53:01,630
I had to grapple.

2143
01:53:01,630 --> 01:53:02,590
He's so wrong.

2144
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:03,470
He's such an idiot.

2145
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:04,270
I'm such an idiot.

2146
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:05,550
He doesn't know how wrong he is.

2147
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:07,789
I should have hung spiders.

2148
01:53:07,789 --> 01:53:09,390
He doesn't know how wrong he is.

2149
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:11,710
I don't have a single rat in my house.

2150
01:53:14,189 --> 01:53:14,670
Ludwig.

2151
01:53:16,270 --> 01:53:17,949
He had so many ill references.

2152
01:53:17,949 --> 01:53:18,909
It was so tight.

2153
01:53:18,909 --> 01:53:20,189
You're going to get so many more points

2154
01:53:20,189 --> 01:53:21,470
for painting the outside of your house

2155
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:22,989
because it's your only fucking person that did it.

2156
01:53:22,989 --> 01:53:25,149
Just go check out Doug's house.

2157
01:53:25,149 --> 01:53:25,630
All right.

2158
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:26,750
Seedog, you're up next.

2159
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:28,380
Are you ready?

2160
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:29,260
Oh, by the way,

2161
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:31,420
we can change the quality here potentially.

2162
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:33,340
Under your stream quality settings,

2163
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:36,060
set stream quality to better text readability.

2164
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:39,069
It might actually increase the bitrate.

2165
01:53:39,069 --> 01:53:40,430
Oh, is that on Discord?

2166
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:41,310
I believe so.

2167
01:53:41,310 --> 01:53:42,670
And if you're streaming at the highest quality,

2168
01:53:42,670 --> 01:53:43,229
stream it at 30.

2169
01:53:43,229 --> 01:53:44,800
Is this Nitro?

2170
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:45,039
This is...

2171
01:53:45,039 --> 01:53:45,920
Oh, it's a community server.

2172
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:46,560
Everything's listed up.

2173
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,279
We got HD streaming.

2174
01:53:49,279 --> 01:53:50,399
Yeah, so if we can do...

2175
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:52,720
When you do your stream,

2176
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:55,439
do it at 30 FPS rather than 60.

2177
01:53:55,439 --> 01:53:56,560
Try to go with the highest quality

2178
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,239
and do that text readable thing at 30 FPS.

2179
01:53:58,239 --> 01:53:59,039
Should probably also have...

2180
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:02,600
Who's the other person streaming in the Discord?

2181
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:05,399
I can't see it because the dot-dot-dots.

2182
01:54:05,399 --> 01:54:07,000
Oh, just only have me do it?

2183
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,020
Yeah.

2184
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:10,939
So if you want to watch,

2185
01:54:10,939 --> 01:54:12,220
maybe open up the person's stream

2186
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,180
that's currently doing it.

2187
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:13,739
That makes sense.

2188
01:54:13,739 --> 01:54:15,819
I think just watching through JermaStream, yeah.

2189
01:54:15,819 --> 01:54:17,420
Yeah, that's probably the best way to do it.

2190
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:18,439
Okay.

2191
01:54:18,439 --> 01:54:20,600
So Joel, you should turn your screen share off, Joel,

2192
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,439
because we're moving on to Seedog.

2193
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:23,819
So Seedog, did you...

2194
01:54:24,699 --> 01:54:26,220
Oh my God, I'm muted this whole time.

2195
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,340
Oh my God, I'm an idiot.

2196
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:28,300
Oh my God.

2197
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:29,659
I was talking to you guys for like five minutes.

2198
01:54:31,449 --> 01:54:32,829
We heard you.

2199
01:54:32,829 --> 01:54:34,829
All right, are we ready to...

2200
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:36,350
Can you see me?

2201
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:37,439
I can.

2202
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:37,840
Let me just make...

2203
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,119
Let's make sure it actually looks okay first

2204
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:39,680
before we move on.

2205
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:40,159
Looks good, yeah.

2206
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:41,279
Tell me how many P's is that?

2207
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:41,680
Hey, it looks...

2208
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,760
I was offering 101 of 100.

2209
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:44,640
It actually looks...

2210
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,600
It looks pretty good.

2211
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,439
It actually looks good.

2212
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:47,760
All right.

2213
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:48,560
This looks great.

2214
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,760
Okay.

2215
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:53,560
So the Discord screen sharing

2216
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:54,840
is kind of giving me a seizure,

2217
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:55,479
but that's fine.

2218
01:54:55,479 --> 01:54:57,079
I can still do the tour and my chat doesn't see it.

2219
01:54:57,079 --> 01:54:58,039
So I'm fine to suffer.

2220
01:54:58,039 --> 01:54:58,359
Okay.

2221
01:54:58,359 --> 01:54:59,000
Are you sure?

2222
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,279
Yeah, because it looks pretty good.

2223
01:55:00,279 --> 01:55:00,920
We're good.

2224
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,840
Just bear in mind that I'm fighting that for you

2225
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:03,720
when you're grading.

2226
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:04,359
I got it.

2227
01:55:04,359 --> 01:55:04,760
I got you.

2228
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:04,920
All right.

2229
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:05,479
Are we ready?

2230
01:55:05,479 --> 01:55:06,199
How are you doing?

2231
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:07,310
I'm doing good.

2232
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:08,430
Do you want to see the outside first?

2233
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:10,189
Is that where we normally start on these things?

2234
01:55:10,189 --> 01:55:10,510
Yeah.

2235
01:55:10,510 --> 01:55:11,470
You are free to give me the tour

2236
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:13,039
however you'd like to.

2237
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:13,359
All right.

2238
01:55:13,359 --> 01:55:14,079
So let's have a look.

2239
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:16,000
Let's have a look how clean the garden is.

2240
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,340
You know, we've...

2241
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:19,739
I've gone for a minimalist approach with the garden.

2242
01:55:20,779 --> 01:55:24,170
By minimalist, you mean you removed everything?

2243
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:26,649
Well, yeah, but that's what I thought it meant.

2244
01:55:26,649 --> 01:55:29,180
So you took cleanliness as

2245
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:30,939
get rid of every single plant.

2246
01:55:30,939 --> 01:55:34,460
Well, yeah, because there's stuff that lives in dirt

2247
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,220
that's dirty, like worms and stuff.

2248
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:38,939
So I wanted to get rid of the grass that they would live in.

2249
01:55:38,939 --> 01:55:39,100
Okay.

2250
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:39,899
All right.

2251
01:55:39,899 --> 01:55:40,460
Show me your process.

2252
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:41,020
I left the trees

2253
01:55:41,979 --> 01:55:43,739
mainly because I couldn't burn them down.

2254
01:55:43,739 --> 01:55:44,619
Oh, I could have cut them.

2255
01:55:44,619 --> 01:55:45,579
I didn't really...

2256
01:55:45,579 --> 01:55:46,779
I left them intentionally.

2257
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,560
So you tried to burn them down.

2258
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,119
It didn't work.

2259
01:55:50,119 --> 01:55:50,359
Okay.

2260
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:52,680
I get you.

2261
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:54,520
I thought if God wanted them there,

2262
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,720
the flamethrower surely would have kept them.

2263
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:57,520
You know what I mean?

2264
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:58,079
Here's the thing.

2265
01:55:58,079 --> 01:55:59,199
It is clean.

2266
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:00,699
It is clean.

2267
01:56:00,699 --> 01:56:02,220
Very extremely clean.

2268
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:03,979
Not a single weed around.

2269
01:56:03,979 --> 01:56:04,699
Very clean.

2270
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:06,220
Exceptionally clean.

2271
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:06,779
Even the back?

2272
01:56:07,979 --> 01:56:08,939
Not nothing.

2273
01:56:08,939 --> 01:56:09,579
Okay.

2274
01:56:09,579 --> 01:56:10,380
All right.

2275
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:10,859
Okay.

2276
01:56:10,859 --> 01:56:13,500
There is some patches, but they just grew back over time.

2277
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,420
I did actually get rid of these initially.

2278
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:16,699
But this grew back.

2279
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,079
This grew back in the time that you were doing?

2280
01:56:19,079 --> 01:56:19,319
Okay.

2281
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:20,590
All right.

2282
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:21,069
Yeah, it did.

2283
01:56:21,069 --> 01:56:21,789
It did.

2284
01:56:21,789 --> 01:56:22,270
Very clean.

2285
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:23,739
Ignore the wall.

2286
01:56:23,739 --> 01:56:24,140
Yeah.

2287
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:25,020
Looks all right.

2288
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:28,569
I would have liked some shrubbery if it was possible.

2289
01:56:28,569 --> 01:56:29,930
I would have liked a little bit of...

2290
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:31,050
I left this one in here.

2291
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:34,640
Mainly because I couldn't remove it.

2292
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:37,119
So I did leave that in.

2293
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:38,689
Okay.

2294
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:41,949
So are you ready for the tour?

2295
01:56:41,949 --> 01:56:43,390
I am ready for the tour.

2296
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:46,909
I love how you're spending a lot of time in the outside.

2297
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:52,140
What the fuck is happening here?

2298
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:57,500
You've got the green M&M thinking about societal collapse and falls.

2299
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:57,979
All right.

2300
01:56:57,979 --> 01:57:00,220
And I love how there's like the ad of the person

2301
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:02,380
who actually like where you got that picture from.

2302
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:03,260
So it's good credit.

2303
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:04,220
You got credit there.

2304
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:05,979
That's actually very thoughtful of you.

2305
01:57:05,979 --> 01:57:08,140
You can credit the artists here on this channel.

2306
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:08,640
Okay.

2307
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:11,979
We have an image of me pointing to the enter.

2308
01:57:13,479 --> 01:57:15,239
Oh, that's you at the entrance.

2309
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:17,399
It's me in a maid outfit.

2310
01:57:17,399 --> 01:57:19,960
This happens a lot actually on my streams and content.

2311
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:22,279
So I thought it would be a fun callback.

2312
01:57:22,279 --> 01:57:22,779
Okay.

2313
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:26,680
I'm so sorry.

2314
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:28,600
I have other...

2315
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:36,279
So you actually you did an exterior.

2316
01:57:36,279 --> 01:57:37,560
I will give you credit for that.

2317
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:39,640
You did a very elaborate exterior.

2318
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:41,100
Yeah.

2319
01:57:43,479 --> 01:57:44,359
Sorry to interrupt you.

2320
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:44,840
I didn't mean to.

2321
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:45,399
I just wanted to...

2322
01:57:45,399 --> 01:57:46,359
Oh, no, it's your tour.

2323
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:46,840
It's your tour.

2324
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:47,880
Please give me your philosophy.

2325
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:48,760
I need to hear it.

2326
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:54,359
You are essentially the guy that we all are here to impress.

2327
01:57:54,359 --> 01:57:57,720
And I noticed that in a lot of my favorite countries,

2328
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:01,479
they tend to have pictures of the guy in charge on walls.

2329
01:58:01,479 --> 01:58:04,279
So I thought, well, why don't I mimic that and have the,

2330
01:58:04,279 --> 01:58:07,640
you know, this is the biggest mural be of the guy in charge.

2331
01:58:08,699 --> 01:58:09,020
Right.

2332
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:09,420
But you...

2333
01:58:10,699 --> 01:58:12,300
I'm going to give Doki a little bit of points on this

2334
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:15,180
because you went less like Rembrandt painting

2335
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:17,340
to show how interesting and amazing I look to

2336
01:58:17,979 --> 01:58:20,779
more like the guy melting at the end of Indiana Jones.

2337
01:58:21,979 --> 01:58:25,279
I think that's a little bit of a point deduction.

2338
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:28,640
It was the first one that came up on Google.

2339
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:29,920
What did you type?

2340
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:36,119
What do you mean that's the first thing that came up on Google?

2341
01:58:36,119 --> 01:58:37,399
What did you type into Google?

2342
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:41,819
It's the Japanese Google.

2343
01:58:41,819 --> 01:58:42,319
It's different.

2344
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:44,140
It's a different Google.

2345
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:44,699
All right.

2346
01:58:44,699 --> 01:58:45,020
Okay.

2347
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:45,579
I'm feeling it.

2348
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:47,979
If you tried it now, it wouldn't work.

2349
01:58:47,979 --> 01:58:49,770
Okay.

2350
01:58:49,770 --> 01:58:50,489
Okay.

2351
01:58:50,489 --> 01:58:50,729
All right.

2352
01:58:50,729 --> 01:58:52,140
So, okay.

2353
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:53,180
So I will preface.

2354
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:53,979
Actually, no, you know what?

2355
01:58:53,979 --> 01:58:54,220
I won't.

2356
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:54,779
I won't preface.

2357
01:58:54,779 --> 01:58:55,340
I won't tell you.

2358
01:58:57,630 --> 01:58:57,949
Okay.

2359
01:58:59,479 --> 01:59:00,840
Having that dog in me.

2360
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:02,720
Okay.

2361
01:59:05,229 --> 01:59:09,229
We blocked this off because I just didn't want it.

2362
01:59:09,229 --> 01:59:10,590
I was tired of doors.

2363
01:59:10,590 --> 01:59:11,050
What?

2364
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:13,289
You didn't even put a door?

2365
01:59:13,289 --> 01:59:13,689
No, no, no.

2366
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:14,329
There's a door.

2367
01:59:15,449 --> 01:59:15,689
Hold on.

2368
01:59:15,689 --> 01:59:16,250
Wait, wait, wait.

2369
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,050
It's another door.

2370
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:18,250
Can you get into the house?

2371
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:24,520
That structural integrity is going to see you at least at a C right now.

2372
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:25,399
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

2373
01:59:25,399 --> 01:59:26,439
You can get in the house.

2374
01:59:26,439 --> 01:59:27,159
You can get in the house.

2375
01:59:27,159 --> 01:59:28,199
Wait, you can get in the house?

2376
01:59:28,199 --> 01:59:28,760
Okay.

2377
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:29,880
Of course you can get in the house.

2378
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,039
What kind of asshole would I be if I made a house without doors?

2379
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:32,439
True.

2380
01:59:32,439 --> 01:59:34,439
You know, I've been living in Japan now for a while,

2381
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:37,500
and I've been concerned with earthquakes,

2382
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:40,859
and I just thought that these doors here,

2383
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,420
they were just a hazard waiting to happen.

2384
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:44,619
So I blocked those off.

2385
01:59:44,619 --> 01:59:45,119
Okay.

2386
01:59:45,899 --> 01:59:46,939
I don't even know what this is.

2387
01:59:46,939 --> 01:59:48,060
I'll be honest with you.

2388
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:50,380
I just put it up there.

2389
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:50,619
Okay.

2390
01:59:50,619 --> 01:59:54,619
Was this like the first picture in like the folder of the meme folder you have on your desktop?

2391
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:59,239
I asked the viewers because I didn't have time to get them.

2392
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:01,079
I asked the views to send me memes,

2393
02:00:01,079 --> 02:00:02,520
and some of them aren't great.

2394
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:03,399
Some of them aren't great.

2395
02:00:03,399 --> 02:00:06,939
Connor, Connor, you asked for memes?

2396
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:13,560
Yeah, I didn't know we could put memes in the game until I got in.

2397
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:14,119
It's true.

2398
02:00:14,119 --> 02:00:14,680
That's true.

2399
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,720
I improvised.

2400
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:16,810
That's true.

2401
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:17,050
Okay.

2402
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:19,050
But creativity is going to see a little bit of a hit on that one.

2403
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:19,529
Just a little.

2404
02:00:20,729 --> 02:00:23,529
It's creative because I'm going beyond my means, right?

2405
02:00:25,439 --> 02:00:27,039
This is left by the previous contractor.

2406
02:00:27,039 --> 02:00:27,600
This isn't me.

2407
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:31,840
Even though it's the color of the paint of the outside of the house, you didn't do that.

2408
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,770
I didn't do it.

2409
02:00:34,569 --> 02:00:35,850
The contractor left it there.

2410
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:36,170
Okay.

2411
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:36,729
Got it.

2412
02:00:36,729 --> 02:00:36,970
I see.

2413
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:37,369
We got you.

2414
02:00:37,369 --> 02:00:38,890
They leave stuff all the time.

2415
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:40,489
Right.

2416
02:00:40,489 --> 02:00:42,939
So why are you laughing?

2417
02:00:42,939 --> 02:00:43,819
This is serious.

2418
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:48,460
Because this is not even a house.

2419
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:52,060
This is just walls with giant like pictures on them.

2420
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:52,380
All right.

2421
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:52,779
Let's go.

2422
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:54,300
No, no, no.

2423
02:00:56,199 --> 02:00:57,960
This is so much more than that.

2424
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:58,439
Okay.

2425
02:00:58,439 --> 02:00:58,600
All right.

2426
02:00:58,600 --> 02:00:58,920
I'll let you go.

2427
02:00:58,920 --> 02:00:59,800
What I have.

2428
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,439
Okay.

2429
02:01:00,439 --> 02:01:04,989
First of all, I find that the concept...

2430
02:01:04,989 --> 02:01:05,149
Okay.

2431
02:01:05,149 --> 02:01:05,550
First of all.

2432
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:05,869
All right.

2433
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:11,079
Okay.

2434
02:01:11,079 --> 02:01:11,239
Wait.

2435
02:01:11,239 --> 02:01:15,850
Before you go any further, is there furniture in your house?

2436
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:16,329
Yes.

2437
02:01:16,329 --> 02:01:16,649
Okay.

2438
02:01:18,539 --> 02:01:19,659
There actually is furniture.

2439
02:01:19,659 --> 02:01:20,060
There actually is.

2440
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:20,300
All right.

2441
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:20,460
Okay.

2442
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:22,409
So let me...

2443
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:24,569
Actually, I'm laughing too.

2444
02:01:24,569 --> 02:01:26,090
I can't present seriously.

2445
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:33,960
So in the house, I decided that because you were talking about creativity,

2446
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,239
you were talking about complexity,

2447
02:01:35,239 --> 02:01:38,279
I thought why not merge the two concepts into one

2448
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:44,439
and take some kind of ideas from some of the properties that I enjoy.

2449
02:01:44,439 --> 02:01:50,520
So I decided that, okay, well, I'm a big fan of fun, elaborate mazes that kind of...

2450
02:01:52,199 --> 02:01:53,800
You think you're going the right way, but you're going the wrong way.

2451
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,319
I mean, it's the whole point of a maze.

2452
02:01:55,319 --> 02:01:58,920
But I thought it would be fun because oftentimes in modern house design,

2453
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:01,239
it's all about knocking the walls down.

2454
02:02:01,239 --> 02:02:07,079
I thought, no, why don't we put more walls, just so many walls,

2455
02:02:07,079 --> 02:02:08,760
that it's actually just inconvenient to live there.

2456
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:11,560
But in fact, I did leave these here because I'm not a monster.

2457
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:12,760
I want you to be able to charge your phone.

2458
02:02:14,199 --> 02:02:17,560
And then I decorated it with some pictures that I found.

2459
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:18,359
Okay.

2460
02:02:18,359 --> 02:02:18,840
So...

2461
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:23,399
So it's an anti-open concept room, an unopened room, you could say.

2462
02:02:23,399 --> 02:02:23,640
Okay.

2463
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:27,720
So the whole house is a maze.

2464
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,489
It's themed after kind of the back rooms.

2465
02:02:30,489 --> 02:02:32,409
Yeah, I painted the entire thing yellow.

2466
02:02:32,409 --> 02:02:35,289
Hold on, why is calm Nintendo music playing right now?

2467
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:38,909
I thought you did that.

2468
02:02:40,109 --> 02:02:41,869
I was about to go, holy shit.

2469
02:02:41,869 --> 02:02:42,989
I was like, well, creative.

2470
02:02:42,989 --> 02:02:44,270
Wow, why don't we turn this corner?

2471
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:45,789
You got your own audio like Joel.

2472
02:02:45,789 --> 02:02:47,789
I put that in actually.

2473
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:54,300
Are you familiar with the brutalistic styles of Svavitch?

2474
02:02:56,079 --> 02:02:58,319
No, but let's continue.

2475
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:00,720
So we're in the first hallway.

2476
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:02,880
Yeah, where do you want to go in the maze?

2477
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,159
Do you want to go forward or do you want to turn?

2478
02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:09,039
I would like to turn right because I see a little bit of a structural integrity

2479
02:03:09,039 --> 02:03:10,479
complexity issue up here.

2480
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:11,279
What's going on here?

2481
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:13,760
This is part of the frights.

2482
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:14,479
I left this here.

2483
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:17,149
That's intentional.

2484
02:03:17,149 --> 02:03:18,029
Yeah, I left this here.

2485
02:03:18,029 --> 02:03:21,149
I remodeled the entire floor.

2486
02:03:21,149 --> 02:03:22,670
I had to knock down all the walls.

2487
02:03:22,670 --> 02:03:23,710
I had to border off everything.

2488
02:03:23,710 --> 02:03:24,750
I got rid of all the windows.

2489
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:25,789
They're all gone.

2490
02:03:25,869 --> 02:03:29,550
And I left this here as a kind of a keepsake of the previous owner,

2491
02:03:29,550 --> 02:03:31,229
who was kind enough to sell me this house.

2492
02:03:32,029 --> 02:03:33,149
I wanted to just have something.

2493
02:03:33,149 --> 02:03:34,989
Also, it's terrifying when you walk in because, you know,

2494
02:03:34,989 --> 02:03:37,310
the fact that you could scrape your head, boom, like that, you know.

2495
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:39,789
I mean, I'm going to let you slide on that one

2496
02:03:39,789 --> 02:03:41,229
because that was an unbelievable bullshit.

2497
02:03:41,229 --> 02:03:42,109
That was unbelievable.

2498
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:43,069
I'll let you slide on that one.

2499
02:03:45,119 --> 02:03:46,000
So you want to turn right?

2500
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:46,880
I would like to turn right.

2501
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:49,399
Would you like to keep progressing forward?

2502
02:03:50,199 --> 02:03:55,560
I would like to continue to go forward.

2503
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,119
Yes, I would.

2504
02:03:57,899 --> 02:03:59,979
I would like you to stop and go back.

2505
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:01,449
Okay.

2506
02:04:01,449 --> 02:04:05,529
I would like you to quickly explain what is going on with the wall on the left here.

2507
02:04:05,529 --> 02:04:06,829
Go like turn around.

2508
02:04:08,029 --> 02:04:08,829
What's happening on here?

2509
02:04:08,829 --> 02:04:11,930
This is a structural integrity complexity issue.

2510
02:04:11,930 --> 02:04:12,329
No, no.

2511
02:04:12,329 --> 02:04:16,699
So the, as you can see by the minimap, don't look at it too much there,

2512
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:21,020
but it's just purely just here as you saw them.

2513
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:24,220
I saw the minimap when you said that.

2514
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:24,619
Okay.

2515
02:04:24,619 --> 02:04:24,939
All right.

2516
02:04:24,939 --> 02:04:27,479
I'll keep my mouth shut.

2517
02:04:27,479 --> 02:04:34,109
You can see that the entire design philosophy is to restrict the space.

2518
02:04:35,310 --> 02:04:39,069
All the time, everyone is talking about how much square footage.

2519
02:04:39,069 --> 02:04:41,869
No one's thought about how much square footage can I have

2520
02:04:41,869 --> 02:04:43,710
and how much can I make it useless.

2521
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:49,069
So I think it's a fun concept to just start restricting space in an awkward way.

2522
02:04:49,069 --> 02:04:51,279
So now you can't even put anything here.

2523
02:04:51,279 --> 02:04:52,880
It's just inconvenient.

2524
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:56,569
You're wondering why is that there?

2525
02:04:56,569 --> 02:04:58,489
I actually understand that.

2526
02:04:58,489 --> 02:04:58,970
I get it.

2527
02:04:59,850 --> 02:05:01,529
I'm just trying to get a little more of your video up.

2528
02:05:01,529 --> 02:05:02,329
There we go.

2529
02:05:02,329 --> 02:05:02,750
Yeah.

2530
02:05:02,750 --> 02:05:02,989
Okay.

2531
02:05:02,989 --> 02:05:05,789
So I would like you to turn around again.

2532
02:05:05,789 --> 02:05:06,880
Okay.

2533
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:07,439
Over here?

2534
02:05:07,439 --> 02:05:08,800
I would like you to go straight.

2535
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,039
Okay.

2536
02:05:10,039 --> 02:05:12,670
I would like for you to turn right at the end of this.

2537
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:13,069
Okay.

2538
02:05:13,069 --> 02:05:13,390
Okay.

2539
02:05:13,390 --> 02:05:15,869
I would like you to go in this room and I'd like you to just...

2540
02:05:16,590 --> 02:05:17,069
Okay.

2541
02:05:17,069 --> 02:05:17,630
So this is...

2542
02:05:18,270 --> 02:05:19,369
What was this going to be?

2543
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:21,130
I don't know.

2544
02:05:21,130 --> 02:05:22,090
This is the whole point.

2545
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:24,510
It's just like to signal that you've gone the wrong way.

2546
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:27,069
Oh, but you didn't put like a piece of cheese down on the ground.

2547
02:05:27,069 --> 02:05:28,590
Creativity points deducted by two.

2548
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:31,920
Why would I reward them for going the wrong way?

2549
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:32,479
They're idiots.

2550
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:33,359
This cheese is not on the ground.

2551
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:34,880
That's deducted by two points in creativity.

2552
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,399
You can clearly see that it's not painted.

2553
02:05:36,399 --> 02:05:37,600
Thus, you must not go this way.

2554
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:40,039
Connor, there's no cheese on the ground.

2555
02:05:40,039 --> 02:05:40,840
I'm sorry.

2556
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:41,000
Why?

2557
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:43,560
Is there cheese in this game?

2558
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,680
Let me pull up the tablet right now.

2559
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:45,239
There's no cheese.

2560
02:05:45,239 --> 02:05:45,640
There's no cheese.

2561
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:46,520
There's no way there's cheese.

2562
02:05:47,399 --> 02:05:47,960
Yeah.

2563
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:49,399
There's cheese.

2564
02:05:49,399 --> 02:05:50,199
There's no...

2565
02:05:50,199 --> 02:05:52,600
Connor, I'm sorry.

2566
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,640
I didn't see that actually.

2567
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:53,880
Sorry.

2568
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:54,279
Okay.

2569
02:05:54,279 --> 02:05:54,680
My bad.

2570
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:54,920
Sorry.

2571
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:55,880
I shouldn't have argued you there.

2572
02:05:58,029 --> 02:05:59,630
Well, I don't even see what your pictures were.

2573
02:05:59,630 --> 02:05:59,949
All right.

2574
02:05:59,949 --> 02:06:02,750
Go back and let's do the rest of this.

2575
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:03,420
All right.

2576
02:06:03,979 --> 02:06:04,939
You've chosen the right way.

2577
02:06:04,939 --> 02:06:05,899
Congratulations.

2578
02:06:05,899 --> 02:06:06,380
Okay.

2579
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:11,020
Thus, signaled by the banana cocktail-esque wallpaper.

2580
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:13,100
I painted this entire goddamn maze, by the way.

2581
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:13,659
You'll see this.

2582
02:06:13,659 --> 02:06:14,220
Okay.

2583
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,710
This is painstaking.

2584
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:18,279
I don't know what this is.

2585
02:06:19,159 --> 02:06:19,960
Just a meme image.

2586
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:20,359
It's all right.

2587
02:06:20,359 --> 02:06:21,079
Just a meme image.

2588
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:22,699
It's just a...

2589
02:06:22,699 --> 02:06:22,939
Yeah.

2590
02:06:23,579 --> 02:06:25,899
Like I say, it hurts to be in your house.

2591
02:06:25,899 --> 02:06:27,439
Why does it hurt?

2592
02:06:27,439 --> 02:06:28,560
I feel like my shoulders are...

2593
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,079
I have to go like this when I'm in your house.

2594
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:30,640
That's the point.

2595
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:31,600
That's the point of the house.

2596
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:31,840
Okay.

2597
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:32,880
You're not supposed to be comfortable.

2598
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:33,439
It's my house.

2599
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:34,399
Get out of my house.

2600
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:34,560
Okay.

2601
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:34,800
All right.

2602
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:35,199
Keep going.

2603
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:36,399
All right.

2604
02:06:36,399 --> 02:06:36,800
So here's...

2605
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,600
We have another meme.

2606
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:42,430
It's sky raisins and jalapenos sky raisins.

2607
02:06:42,430 --> 02:06:43,229
Keep going.

2608
02:06:43,229 --> 02:06:44,829
Keep going down this hallway.

2609
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:47,310
I would like to move forward.

2610
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:47,869
I would like to move forward.

2611
02:06:47,869 --> 02:06:47,949
Okay.

2612
02:06:47,949 --> 02:06:49,949
Would you like to keep going forward or would you like to turn?

2613
02:06:50,829 --> 02:06:53,210
I want to turn right down this.

2614
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:55,050
All right.

2615
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:55,449
Okay.

2616
02:06:55,449 --> 02:06:56,010
Okay.

2617
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:57,850
And keep going just through here.

2618
02:06:58,810 --> 02:06:59,050
All right.

2619
02:06:59,050 --> 02:06:59,449
We have...

2620
02:07:01,239 --> 02:07:03,800
Why is it getting tighter and tighter and tighter in here?

2621
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:04,920
Yeah, I did that on purpose.

2622
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,760
I'm trying to make it as little room as possible.

2623
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:07,239
Okay.

2624
02:07:07,239 --> 02:07:08,279
I don't know what that is,

2625
02:07:08,279 --> 02:07:09,880
but you just keep going through that.

2626
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:11,560
That looks good.

2627
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,199
Okay.

2628
02:07:12,199 --> 02:07:13,079
This is Yoda.

2629
02:07:13,079 --> 02:07:13,479
The Yoda.

2630
02:07:13,479 --> 02:07:17,000
You got to get some creative points for putting Yoda in this.

2631
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:17,319
I don't...

2632
02:07:17,319 --> 02:07:18,039
Is that pizza?

2633
02:07:18,039 --> 02:07:19,000
Is it a cat with a pizza?

2634
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,720
Is it a peanut butter?

2635
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,640
You left another paint bucket on the ground, Connor.

2636
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:23,960
Oh, no.

2637
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:24,439
That was...

2638
02:07:24,439 --> 02:07:24,760
He got lost in the maze.

2639
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:26,199
Oh, Connor.

2640
02:07:26,199 --> 02:07:26,680
Connor.

2641
02:07:27,479 --> 02:07:30,680
Your complexity and structure grade right now is a 65.

2642
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:32,359
I'm sorry.

2643
02:07:32,359 --> 02:07:33,239
Oh, it's there on...

2644
02:07:33,239 --> 02:07:34,920
I'm sorry.

2645
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:35,640
It just is...

2646
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:37,439
We're going to...

2647
02:07:37,439 --> 02:07:38,399
I got to get your grades up here.

2648
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:39,840
These are Joel's.

2649
02:07:40,479 --> 02:07:46,140
Let's clear those because you're at a 68 in complexity right now.

2650
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:47,180
Oh, no, really?

2651
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:47,680
Yeah.

2652
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:51,279
The thing about this part is that it's a skill check

2653
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:53,279
because as you can see, I just got stuck on it there

2654
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:55,920
and you have to actually clip through it to get through.

2655
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,760
You see I'm kind of stuck right now, but there we go.

2656
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:58,239
We got it.

2657
02:07:58,239 --> 02:07:58,399
Okay.

2658
02:07:58,399 --> 02:07:59,439
So now you're in.

2659
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:01,609
It's a potential skill check.

2660
02:08:01,609 --> 02:08:01,930
Okay.

2661
02:08:01,930 --> 02:08:05,210
So now this is the second time you've used this image.

2662
02:08:05,210 --> 02:08:06,250
I just want to make sure that's clear.

2663
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:07,369
Third, actually, but...

2664
02:08:07,369 --> 02:08:07,930
Oh, third.

2665
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:09,529
It is third.

2666
02:08:09,529 --> 02:08:10,489
It's an illusion.

2667
02:08:10,489 --> 02:08:11,210
It's an illusion.

2668
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:13,369
So you come through, you're like, well, I just came this way.

2669
02:08:13,369 --> 02:08:13,930
There's no way this...

2670
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:17,770
Oh, did I go the wrong way perhaps?

2671
02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:18,010
Right.

2672
02:08:18,569 --> 02:08:18,890
Okay.

2673
02:08:18,890 --> 02:08:19,289
Okay.

2674
02:08:19,289 --> 02:08:20,409
Are you good to continue?

2675
02:08:20,409 --> 02:08:21,770
We are good to continue.

2676
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:25,579
I'm getting my grades correct here so far.

2677
02:08:25,579 --> 02:08:25,819
Okay.

2678
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:28,920
I'm good to continue.

2679
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,859
What is that?

2680
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:32,859
You can use that.

2681
02:08:32,859 --> 02:08:33,739
What does that mean, use?

2682
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:35,199
What do you mean?

2683
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:36,000
Press E on that.

2684
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:36,479
What does that mean?

2685
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:41,159
Okay.

2686
02:08:41,159 --> 02:08:41,399
All right.

2687
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:41,720
I get it.

2688
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:42,039
I get it.

2689
02:08:42,039 --> 02:08:42,840
Oh, I can change it.

2690
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:43,880
I'll change it to me.

2691
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:44,359
There we go.

2692
02:08:44,359 --> 02:08:44,840
There we go.

2693
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:46,279
Oh, right.

2694
02:08:46,279 --> 02:08:47,479
I think that changes things a lot.

2695
02:08:47,479 --> 02:08:50,039
That stretched me in a comfortable way.

2696
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:51,640
All right.

2697
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:52,840
Your creativity is...

2698
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:55,239
I got your creativity so far at a 72.

2699
02:08:55,239 --> 02:08:55,720
That's a C.

2700
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:57,560
It's above a C, C minus.

2701
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,279
I think you can really...

2702
02:08:58,279 --> 02:08:59,079
It's high, right?

2703
02:08:59,079 --> 02:08:59,960
It can go higher.

2704
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:01,880
I just want to let you know that your philosophy right now,

2705
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:03,720
I'm going to give you a 95.

2706
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:04,510
And the reason...

2707
02:09:04,510 --> 02:09:04,829
Oh, my God.

2708
02:09:04,829 --> 02:09:05,470
Thank you so much.

2709
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:08,109
The reason why you're getting a 95 in philosophy is because

2710
02:09:08,109 --> 02:09:10,909
you took this concept of walls and maze

2711
02:09:10,909 --> 02:09:12,430
and you made it your entire house.

2712
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:14,750
I've yet to see a piece of furniture, by the way.

2713
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:16,670
I've yet to see a piece of furniture, by the way.

2714
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:18,590
You will see furniture, don't you worry.

2715
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:19,789
So we'll go forward.

2716
02:09:19,789 --> 02:09:21,869
And we can go this way, but there's nothing.

2717
02:09:21,869 --> 02:09:24,029
You can just stand here and contemplate.

2718
02:09:24,029 --> 02:09:26,189
You can also get a good view of this meme,

2719
02:09:26,189 --> 02:09:28,350
which says, I'll allow you to read it.

2720
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:30,989
I look at the blood ocean sometimes and think, for real?

2721
02:09:31,789 --> 02:09:34,829
That's where the government is sending me in a windowless submarine.

2722
02:09:34,829 --> 02:09:36,989
As capital punishment for the greater good of the human race,

2723
02:09:36,989 --> 02:09:38,670
there is something outside...

2724
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:40,350
I'm going to have to give you a 70 on creativity.

2725
02:09:42,939 --> 02:09:43,899
I couldn't even tell.

2726
02:09:43,899 --> 02:09:45,020
I couldn't even read what's going on here.

2727
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:47,710
Okay, so I'll give you...

2728
02:09:47,710 --> 02:09:48,670
I'm going to drop the point.

2729
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:49,550
Actually, I'll give you 71.

2730
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:52,319
No, 73.

2731
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:53,279
I'll give you 73.

2732
02:09:53,279 --> 02:09:54,880
I think you think I appreciate that.

2733
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:56,239
So I can go this way, right?

2734
02:09:56,239 --> 02:09:56,739
Yep.

2735
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,199
We also missed a completely...

2736
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:00,159
This is the main branch.

2737
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:01,039
I'll just spoil it for you.

2738
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:01,600
Okay.

2739
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:01,840
You can...

2740
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,359
There was another branch as well that you missed.

2741
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:04,479
Oh, show me, show me.

2742
02:10:04,479 --> 02:10:05,279
Please do, please do.

2743
02:10:05,279 --> 02:10:06,239
Yeah, yeah, it's...

2744
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:06,640
Let me just...

2745
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:07,359
It's going to take a minute.

2746
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:08,319
Actually, I got to go through all this.

2747
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:08,720
Hold on.

2748
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:11,600
We do have about a 10-minute time limit for every contestant,

2749
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:13,840
but it's okay.

2750
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:14,399
But it's all right.

2751
02:10:14,399 --> 02:10:16,319
I think we can go over for a lot of these.

2752
02:10:16,319 --> 02:10:16,960
It's fine.

2753
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,319
As long as everyone's cool with chilling for another,

2754
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:20,600
30 minutes or so.

2755
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:24,520
Yeah, this is the other part of the maze.

2756
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:25,800
It's very clean.

2757
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:26,680
It's very clean.

2758
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:27,640
It's extremely clean.

2759
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:28,520
I mean, it has to be.

2760
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:30,600
The whole thing is yellow walls.

2761
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:31,880
It kind of has to...

2762
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:34,039
You have to get a 100 for clean.

2763
02:10:34,039 --> 02:10:34,539
Well...

2764
02:10:35,399 --> 02:10:37,479
No other life form can live here, actually.

2765
02:10:38,199 --> 02:10:40,199
There's so much asbestos and paint.

2766
02:10:40,199 --> 02:10:41,159
It's actually a lot of harm.

2767
02:10:41,159 --> 02:10:42,439
I'm going to do the skill check real quick.

2768
02:10:42,439 --> 02:10:43,640
Hold up.

2769
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:45,680
Can you not even go through your house?

2770
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:47,359
No, like I said, it's a skill check.

2771
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:49,039
So anyone real game is going past this point.

2772
02:10:49,039 --> 02:10:49,520
Oh, okay.

2773
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:51,579
That's actually kind of cool.

2774
02:10:51,659 --> 02:10:52,539
Yeah, I think you're...

2775
02:10:52,539 --> 02:10:53,500
I'll give you...

2776
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:54,939
I'm going to give you a 75 for creativity

2777
02:10:54,939 --> 02:10:56,300
because given a skill check,

2778
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:58,140
an FPS skill check to go through your house

2779
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:58,779
is actually pretty...

2780
02:10:58,779 --> 02:10:59,340
That's interesting.

2781
02:10:59,340 --> 02:10:59,819
Exactly.

2782
02:10:59,819 --> 02:11:00,920
Yep.

2783
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:03,479
So we have another meme image here.

2784
02:11:05,130 --> 02:11:07,050
Okay, near on butt.

2785
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:09,279
Yeah, don't worry about it.

2786
02:11:09,279 --> 02:11:10,399
Is that Bernie Sanders right there?

2787
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:12,319
Is that Bernie Sanders on the left?

2788
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:14,880
No, this is Hide the Pain Herald in RTX.

2789
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:17,340
It wasn't Bernie Sanders.

2790
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:18,619
I'm just going to take a point out.

2791
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:21,260
Would you have preferred it to be Bernie Sanders?

2792
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:22,859
I just thought it was.

2793
02:11:22,859 --> 02:11:23,739
That made me laugh for a second.

2794
02:11:23,739 --> 02:11:24,380
Bernie's changed.

2795
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:24,939
I had to change it.

2796
02:11:25,739 --> 02:11:28,939
And so now I really take the concept of uncomfortable,

2797
02:11:28,939 --> 02:11:31,100
you know, kind of an alleyways to an extreme here

2798
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:32,859
by making it literally just...

2799
02:11:32,859 --> 02:11:35,260
You know, it's the limit you can actually walk.

2800
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:38,460
I'm actually surprised you did this in an hour.

2801
02:11:38,460 --> 02:11:40,140
I want to...

2802
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:41,500
Yeah, this is crazy, right?

2803
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:43,000
You did this in an hour.

2804
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,199
Yeah, I did.

2805
02:11:44,199 --> 02:11:46,279
I painted all the fucking walls.

2806
02:11:46,279 --> 02:11:47,159
I'm a psychopath.

2807
02:11:47,159 --> 02:11:47,960
I hate myself.

2808
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:51,439
Yeah, you painted all the walls.

2809
02:11:51,439 --> 02:11:52,479
You really did.

2810
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:55,340
You painted every single wall this color.

2811
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:55,579
Yeah.

2812
02:11:55,579 --> 02:11:56,460
That's dedication.

2813
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:58,779
It took nine hours, actually.

2814
02:11:58,779 --> 02:11:59,579
I started 10.

2815
02:12:00,939 --> 02:12:01,979
That's why I came on the call.

2816
02:12:01,979 --> 02:12:02,619
I was begging you.

2817
02:12:02,619 --> 02:12:04,380
I was like, there's got to be a faster way.

2818
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:05,180
Please tell me.

2819
02:12:06,989 --> 02:12:07,550
There's not.

2820
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:09,479
There wasn't.

2821
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:12,920
So I'm very curious about what's up here on the right.

2822
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:16,520
And I'd like for you to go open this right door.

2823
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:17,159
Yeah.

2824
02:12:17,159 --> 02:12:17,560
Yeah, okay.

2825
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:19,399
We got a Pepe image.

2826
02:12:19,399 --> 02:12:20,039
That's pretty cool.

2827
02:12:20,989 --> 02:12:21,470
Keep going.

2828
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:23,949
The maze gets even more uncomfortable now.

2829
02:12:23,949 --> 02:12:24,430
Now we're just...

2830
02:12:26,090 --> 02:12:28,569
All right, go through the maze.

2831
02:12:29,289 --> 02:12:30,250
Go through the maze.

2832
02:12:30,810 --> 02:12:31,130
Okay.

2833
02:12:32,729 --> 02:12:33,609
Very easy to get lost.

2834
02:12:33,609 --> 02:12:34,010
Here we are.

2835
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:34,489
Now we're in the...

2836
02:12:34,489 --> 02:12:34,810
Oh, I got lost.

2837
02:12:34,810 --> 02:12:35,130
Damn it.

2838
02:12:35,130 --> 02:12:35,449
Hold up.

2839
02:12:35,449 --> 02:12:35,930
Which way was it?

2840
02:12:35,930 --> 02:12:36,329
This way?

2841
02:12:36,329 --> 02:12:36,569
No.

2842
02:12:36,569 --> 02:12:37,130
No, this is...

2843
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:37,689
I'm going back.

2844
02:12:37,689 --> 02:12:37,850
Okay.

2845
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:38,090
No, I know.

2846
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:38,569
That's the wrong way.

2847
02:12:38,569 --> 02:12:39,130
No, you're going the wrong way.

2848
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:39,930
You're going the wrong way.

2849
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:41,130
It's such a complex maze.

2850
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:42,170
It's so easy to get lost.

2851
02:12:42,810 --> 02:12:45,369
Complexity is easily 100, I think, actually.

2852
02:12:45,369 --> 02:12:45,930
Complexity.

2853
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:46,329
That's just my rating.

2854
02:12:46,329 --> 02:12:47,689
Complexity might have to go up a little.

2855
02:12:47,689 --> 02:12:48,010
Okay.

2856
02:12:48,010 --> 02:12:49,689
So there's a stair here.

2857
02:12:49,689 --> 02:12:52,170
And the best part about this stair, when you go up it,

2858
02:12:52,170 --> 02:12:54,569
it's purely aesthetic because it's completely useless.

2859
02:12:54,569 --> 02:12:57,229
There's nothing up here.

2860
02:12:57,229 --> 02:12:58,029
No, no, no, no, no.

2861
02:12:58,029 --> 02:12:58,270
There is.

2862
02:12:58,270 --> 02:12:58,590
There is.

2863
02:12:58,590 --> 02:12:59,949
There absolutely is.

2864
02:12:59,949 --> 02:13:00,430
Okay.

2865
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:00,909
All right.

2866
02:13:00,909 --> 02:13:01,789
I like the aesthetic.

2867
02:13:01,789 --> 02:13:03,149
It's not going to change your score or anything,

2868
02:13:03,149 --> 02:13:04,189
but I like the aesthetic.

2869
02:13:04,189 --> 02:13:05,439
Okay.

2870
02:13:05,439 --> 02:13:06,239
What the fuck is this?

2871
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:07,840
Above me, Scoob.

2872
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:08,960
You got a Scooby Doo.

2873
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,319
You got a Scooby Doo meme in here.

2874
02:13:11,039 --> 02:13:12,880
Take your philosophy down by a few points.

2875
02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:14,560
What?

2876
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,159
It's the part of the film.

2877
02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:16,399
Okay.

2878
02:13:16,399 --> 02:13:17,359
So we go...

2879
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:18,640
Now that we've finished this floor,

2880
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:20,640
it's to signal that you're near the end.

2881
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:20,960
All right.

2882
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:23,840
So I decided to go for a blank aesthetic for the rest of the maze.

2883
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,439
Okay.

2884
02:13:25,439 --> 02:13:27,359
Also, I was running out of paint and time.

2885
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:28,640
Just...

2886
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:29,520
Sorry, let me close this.

2887
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:29,840
You didn't...

2888
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:30,239
Okay.

2889
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:31,279
So you go through now.

2890
02:13:31,279 --> 02:13:32,640
This is where the doors come into effect.

2891
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:35,119
I'm trying to constrict it with a new method now.

2892
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:36,720
What did you fucking make?

2893
02:13:37,359 --> 02:13:37,920
All right.

2894
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,960
It's a new way of constricting.

2895
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,399
So go through here.

2896
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:42,960
Was that Final Fantasy?

2897
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:43,840
All right.

2898
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:44,720
Final Fantasy.

2899
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:47,850
What is going on in this picture?

2900
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:54,880
Where is the furniture?

2901
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:55,760
Where is the furniture?

2902
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,560
Show me the furniture.

2903
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:58,000
Show me the room with the furniture right now.

2904
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:00,000
This is the final...

2905
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,279
Are you sure you want to continue?

2906
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:02,960
We give you a chance to end it all.

2907
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:04,479
Because it can be tough.

2908
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:05,039
This is the...

2909
02:14:05,039 --> 02:14:07,039
And also, I couldn't build a wall here.

2910
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:08,720
But this is your final get out.

2911
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:09,119
If you...

2912
02:14:09,119 --> 02:14:10,560
And also, you get stuck at the doors.

2913
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,439
So you...

2914
02:14:11,439 --> 02:14:12,479
I actually kind of like that.

2915
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:15,439
You made the haunted house thing where, like, if you want to leave...

2916
02:14:15,439 --> 02:14:16,960
It's like, no, no, you can get out of here.

2917
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:17,760
Like, I'm scared.

2918
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:18,399
There's an exit here.

2919
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:18,640
I get it.

2920
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:18,880
Okay.

2921
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,520
I like it.

2922
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:21,359
Are you really sure you want to see what's coming up?

2923
02:14:21,359 --> 02:14:22,880
Because it's bad.

2924
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:25,449
Yeah, that changes things a lot for me.

2925
02:14:25,449 --> 02:14:27,289
So, you know, it's true to life.

2926
02:14:27,289 --> 02:14:28,810
And also, it's safety regulations.

2927
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:29,770
We had to have an exit.

2928
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:29,930
Okay.

2929
02:14:30,569 --> 02:14:31,710
So let's go...

2930
02:14:31,710 --> 02:14:33,069
Okay, you also get clipped on the door.

2931
02:14:33,069 --> 02:14:33,789
So you have to open them.

2932
02:14:33,789 --> 02:14:34,350
It's actually kind of...

2933
02:14:34,989 --> 02:14:36,029
It's kind of a great thing.

2934
02:14:36,029 --> 02:14:37,789
Because you have to consider...

2935
02:14:37,789 --> 02:14:40,189
I love how there's two doors that go to the same place.

2936
02:14:41,609 --> 02:14:42,090
Yes.

2937
02:14:42,090 --> 02:14:44,119
I thought it was more dramatic.

2938
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:44,359
All right.

2939
02:14:44,359 --> 02:14:45,000
Here we go.

2940
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,880
Is this the final room?

2941
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:46,380
Okay.

2942
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:52,380
There is another room.

2943
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:53,260
Of course, there's another room.

2944
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:54,539
But this is the prelude.

2945
02:14:56,590 --> 02:14:57,310
It says...

2946
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:58,989
I'll let you read this.

2947
02:14:58,989 --> 02:15:00,189
All right.

2948
02:15:00,189 --> 02:15:01,229
Sometimes the side...

2949
02:15:01,229 --> 02:15:03,229
If you can't even a chick, it's C-Dog VA.

2950
02:15:03,229 --> 02:15:04,989
Scrump, Dill, Dumpster's, Dump Truck.

2951
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:12,670
This is your live reaction to that.

2952
02:15:12,670 --> 02:15:13,390
Okay.

2953
02:15:13,390 --> 02:15:15,949
I'm going to give you an extra point in complexity.

2954
02:15:15,949 --> 02:15:17,550
I took some points down for creativity.

2955
02:15:18,189 --> 02:15:21,390
There's also this plant matter on the ground.

2956
02:15:21,390 --> 02:15:23,390
I'm going to read down on Glen Lewis a little bit here.

2957
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:24,350
This plant matter on the ground.

2958
02:15:24,350 --> 02:15:25,069
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2959
02:15:26,590 --> 02:15:27,470
They're in jars.

2960
02:15:27,470 --> 02:15:28,750
So that's extremely clean.

2961
02:15:28,750 --> 02:15:29,470
Because we're not...

2962
02:15:29,470 --> 02:15:30,750
There's no dirt.

2963
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:31,789
It's all self-contained.

2964
02:15:33,789 --> 02:15:35,229
Do you see any of the dirt outside?

2965
02:15:35,229 --> 02:15:36,109
Because I don't.

2966
02:15:36,109 --> 02:15:37,310
That's extremely clean.

2967
02:15:37,310 --> 02:15:38,189
That is pretty clean.

2968
02:15:38,189 --> 02:15:40,510
Because we need some oxygen generation.

2969
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:42,090
All right.

2970
02:15:42,090 --> 02:15:42,890
What's the last room?

2971
02:15:42,890 --> 02:15:43,529
Let's see it.

2972
02:15:43,529 --> 02:15:45,550
Well, there's actually another door.

2973
02:15:47,069 --> 02:15:50,619
You just put walls up and put doors on them

2974
02:15:50,619 --> 02:15:52,539
and made a gigantic fucking maze.

2975
02:15:52,539 --> 02:15:53,420
It's the room.

2976
02:15:53,420 --> 02:15:54,699
It's a philosophy.

2977
02:15:54,699 --> 02:15:55,819
I had a hundred points.

2978
02:15:55,819 --> 02:15:58,909
There's the furniture.

2979
02:15:58,909 --> 02:16:00,189
It's one couch.

2980
02:16:00,189 --> 02:16:00,829
All right.

2981
02:16:00,829 --> 02:16:01,550
I'm going to have to...

2982
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:02,510
Here we go.

2983
02:16:02,510 --> 02:16:03,149
No, no, no.

2984
02:16:03,149 --> 02:16:04,590
It's the casting couch.

2985
02:16:04,590 --> 02:16:06,909
Look, Shrek is signaling what could be happening here.

2986
02:16:06,909 --> 02:16:07,149
All right.

2987
02:16:07,149 --> 02:16:08,029
I'm going to have to...

2988
02:16:08,029 --> 02:16:09,229
I do appreciate the maze.

2989
02:16:09,229 --> 02:16:10,829
The maze is very, very interesting.

2990
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:12,750
Look, if you were to tell me

2991
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:14,909
I got an hour and 20 minutes to do something,

2992
02:16:14,909 --> 02:16:16,590
I don't know if an elaborate maze

2993
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:17,949
would be the first thing I would do.

2994
02:16:17,949 --> 02:16:19,229
I would focus on building a room.

2995
02:16:19,949 --> 02:16:20,750
You don't have any rooms.

2996
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:22,109
I built the back rooms.

2997
02:16:22,109 --> 02:16:24,270
You've got zero rooms.

2998
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:24,670
You've got...

2999
02:16:24,670 --> 02:16:25,869
It's all one room.

3000
02:16:25,869 --> 02:16:26,430
No, no.

3001
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:27,630
This is one room.

3002
02:16:27,630 --> 02:16:28,829
This is two rooms.

3003
02:16:28,829 --> 02:16:30,109
This is three rooms.

3004
02:16:30,109 --> 02:16:30,909
So I'm going to give you...

3005
02:16:30,909 --> 02:16:31,789
Here's my grades for you.

3006
02:16:31,789 --> 02:16:32,590
We're going to get Chad's grade.

3007
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:34,030
Chad, if we could go ahead and get Chad's grades.

3008
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:35,549
Remember, it's A, B, C, or D.

3009
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:38,219
I'm going to look at what they're saying.

3010
02:16:38,219 --> 02:16:40,059
I want to see how they're feeling about this.

3011
02:16:40,059 --> 02:16:41,500
I feel like A, for sure.

3012
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:43,180
Well, actually, there are a couple of As.

3013
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:44,620
I've seen a few Bs.

3014
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:50,989
It's A. It's got to be an A, at least.

3015
02:16:50,989 --> 02:16:51,549
There's no way.

3016
02:16:51,549 --> 02:16:53,309
What is Chad's grade?

3017
02:16:53,309 --> 02:16:56,030
You can't give anything lower than a D.

3018
02:16:56,030 --> 02:16:56,430
Sorry.

3019
02:17:01,659 --> 02:17:02,299
Here's what I got you at.

3020
02:17:02,299 --> 02:17:03,500
I got you at a 70 for...

3021
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:05,340
I got you at a C for creativity.

3022
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:06,860
Well, actually, I'm going to give you 75.

3023
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:08,299
I think that you had a...

3024
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,459
I like the maze idea.

3025
02:17:10,459 --> 02:17:11,899
I'll give you 75 for creativity.

3026
02:17:12,889 --> 02:17:15,950
I've got you at a 69 for complexity because...

3027
02:17:16,829 --> 02:17:20,430
It's arguably the most complex house that you'll see all day.

3028
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:23,069
I mean, the amount of walls and redecoration and painting.

3029
02:17:23,069 --> 02:17:24,030
It's extremely complex.

3030
02:17:24,030 --> 02:17:26,649
I got you at an 86 for cleanliness.

3031
02:17:26,649 --> 02:17:31,129
I've got you at an 85 for philosophy because I do think you did have a pretty...

3032
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:32,729
You had a good theme here.

3033
02:17:32,729 --> 02:17:34,569
You've stuck with the theme completely.

3034
02:17:35,579 --> 02:17:37,180
So, Chad's grade is...

3035
02:17:38,909 --> 02:17:43,549
If I may ask, the cleanliness, I mean, I find it hard to believe it's not 100.

3036
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:47,229
Obviously, I disagree with your ruling on this, but I just...

3037
02:17:47,229 --> 02:17:48,590
Where were those 14 points?

3038
02:17:48,590 --> 02:17:49,229
Where are they going?

3039
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:53,659
So, the cleanliness problem was there was two paint cans on the ground.

3040
02:17:53,659 --> 02:17:56,940
And the issue with the paint cans is you had a good cover for the first one,

3041
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:58,379
but the second one was there.

3042
02:17:58,379 --> 02:17:58,620
Also...

3043
02:17:58,620 --> 02:17:59,340
It was a skill check.

3044
02:18:01,959 --> 02:18:05,239
I'll give you an 89 for cleanliness.

3045
02:18:05,239 --> 02:18:05,799
All right. Thank you.

3046
02:18:05,799 --> 02:18:06,040
Thank you.

3047
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:06,120
I appreciate that.

3048
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:07,680
I think that works.

3049
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:10,719
And then Chad's grade is nobody can get lower than a 60.

3050
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:12,079
Conor, I'm sorry.

3051
02:18:12,079 --> 02:18:14,170
They have given you an F.

3052
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:14,649
What?

3053
02:18:14,649 --> 02:18:15,049
Yeah.

3054
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:16,409
An F?

3055
02:18:16,409 --> 02:18:17,450
What? They don't like the maze?

3056
02:18:17,450 --> 02:18:18,409
They didn't like the maze?

3057
02:18:18,409 --> 02:18:18,809
What are you doing?

3058
02:18:18,809 --> 02:18:19,850
I could give them an F.

3059
02:18:19,850 --> 02:18:22,120
How do they not like the maze?

3060
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:25,600
Oh, I liked it.

3061
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:26,239
Oh, my God.

3062
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:27,040
Well, fair enough.

3063
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,000
I swear to God.

3064
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,079
Your overall grade is actually not that bad.

3065
02:18:30,079 --> 02:18:33,520
Your overall grade is a 75.6.

3066
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:35,600
That's a full C.

3067
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:38,719
For somebody that woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning to do this

3068
02:18:38,719 --> 02:18:40,639
and learned how to play the game an hour ago,

3069
02:18:40,639 --> 02:18:41,600
actually great fucking job.

3070
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:42,239
Seriously.

3071
02:18:42,239 --> 02:18:42,719
That's actually...

3072
02:18:42,719 --> 02:18:43,280
You did really well.

3073
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:44,680
I appreciate that.

3074
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:45,000
Thank you.

3075
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:45,639
I'll take the C.

3076
02:18:45,639 --> 02:18:46,520
I'll take the C.

3077
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,600
Overall of a 75.6.

3078
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:49,760
All right. I'll take it.

3079
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:50,159
I'll take it.

3080
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:52,000
Thank you so much for judging me.

3081
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,040
I appreciate it.

3082
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:54,479
Thanks for waking up early for this, Connor.

3083
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:56,090
No worries.

3084
02:18:56,090 --> 02:18:57,049
We're excited to see the rest.

3085
02:18:57,690 --> 02:18:58,489
That was fucking funny.

3086
02:18:58,489 --> 02:18:58,809
Thank you.

3087
02:19:00,350 --> 02:19:01,149
No worries.

3088
02:19:02,510 --> 02:19:02,909
All right.

3089
02:19:03,469 --> 02:19:06,110
That was C-Dawg.

3090
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:08,440
The next person we have is RT.

3091
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:10,540
RT is coming up here next.

3092
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:11,979
Oh, is it myself next?

3093
02:19:11,979 --> 02:19:13,500
I thought it was until later.

3094
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:14,219
Oh, did we...

3095
02:19:14,219 --> 02:19:15,260
Oh, no, we did swap you.

3096
02:19:15,739 --> 02:19:20,909
I'm just making sure that I can get around to everyone.

3097
02:19:20,909 --> 02:19:22,030
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3098
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:24,030
Okay, we swapped out.

3099
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:25,309
It's Alex is here now, right?

3100
02:19:25,309 --> 02:19:28,000
I believe that's who's here now.

3101
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,280
He's completely deafened.

3102
02:19:30,649 --> 02:19:31,370
Yeah, it's Alex.

3103
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:31,930
There.

3104
02:19:31,930 --> 02:19:32,569
Hey.

3105
02:19:32,569 --> 02:19:33,950
He's clear to go.

3106
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:34,750
Are you good?

3107
02:19:34,750 --> 02:19:35,469
Are you ready?

3108
02:19:35,469 --> 02:19:36,430
You want me to go?

3109
02:19:36,430 --> 02:19:37,790
I mean, I'm happy to go.

3110
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:40,670
If you just give me one second here, I can set it up.

3111
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:41,389
I'm good right now.

3112
02:19:41,389 --> 02:19:42,190
Are you good, Alex?

3113
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:43,069
Are you good to stick around?

3114
02:19:43,069 --> 02:19:43,549
Yeah.

3115
02:19:43,549 --> 02:19:44,030
All right.

3116
02:19:44,030 --> 02:19:44,670
Let's go.

3117
02:19:44,670 --> 02:19:47,790
Yeah, and we're trying to keep these around 10-ish minutes.

3118
02:19:47,790 --> 02:19:50,989
I know some of these are worth going around to.

3119
02:19:50,989 --> 02:19:51,950
So, I mean, whatever.

3120
02:19:51,950 --> 02:19:52,430
It's all good.

3121
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:54,270
Everyone should get 25 minutes now.

3122
02:19:54,270 --> 02:19:56,030
Everybody should get 20 minutes.

3123
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:57,479
Wait, no, sorry.

3124
02:19:57,479 --> 02:20:00,040
You can't limit the rest of us to like less time.

3125
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:02,200
We have to make a bargain, too.

3126
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:04,680
Sorry, my Discord completely crashed.

3127
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:05,879
Oh, shit.

3128
02:20:05,879 --> 02:20:06,120
All right.

3129
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:06,680
Well, it's Alex.

3130
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:07,079
Are you ready?

3131
02:20:07,879 --> 02:20:09,399
I didn't mean to just be like put on the spot.

3132
02:20:09,399 --> 02:20:10,520
It's like, right, I'm going home.

3133
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:11,399
I've got nothing to show.

3134
02:20:11,399 --> 02:20:13,079
No, it's a fantastic home.

3135
02:20:13,079 --> 02:20:15,159
Oh, I actually cannot wait to see yours.

3136
02:20:15,159 --> 02:20:16,360
But it's Alex.

3137
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:19,069
You want to go instead of because his Discord crashed?

3138
02:20:19,069 --> 02:20:20,590
OK, I can do that.

3139
02:20:20,590 --> 02:20:22,350
And we'll get you back in RT later.

3140
02:20:22,350 --> 02:20:24,110
All right, Alex, are you ready to put your...

3141
02:20:24,110 --> 02:20:24,909
Fire away.

3142
02:20:24,909 --> 02:20:25,790
...put your stream on?

3143
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:31,180
Let me make sure you can see it.

3144
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:32,700
Somebody, we need to stop Poke?

3145
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:35,760
Is Poke still building?

3146
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:36,879
Poke is still going.

3147
02:20:38,319 --> 02:20:39,760
Did anybody tell him to stop?

3148
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,159
He's still going?

3149
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:43,040
He's still going.

3150
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:43,440
Yeah, that's...

3151
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:48,000
All right, cut.

3152
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,959
Poke, if you can hear us,

3153
02:20:48,959 --> 02:20:50,879
Poke in yours, you need to stop building.

3154
02:20:50,879 --> 02:20:52,159
Poke, you need to stop building.

3155
02:20:52,879 --> 02:20:54,000
Poke, you have to stop building.

3156
02:20:55,129 --> 02:20:56,969
Everyone's been trying to get a hold of him.

3157
02:20:58,250 --> 02:20:59,530
He's just going.

3158
02:20:59,530 --> 02:21:00,489
We tried.

3159
02:21:00,489 --> 02:21:01,770
We pinged him like three times.

3160
02:21:01,770 --> 02:21:03,469
That's so funny.

3161
02:21:03,469 --> 02:21:06,000
All right, so this is Italics.

3162
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,520
Yeah, can you see everything?

3163
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:10,239
We can see and we are very excited, it's Alex.

3164
02:21:10,879 --> 02:21:11,440
The time...

3165
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:15,559
Oh, hey, Poke, yeah, you have to stop building.

3166
02:21:15,559 --> 02:21:19,399
You said 30 FPS, better text readability.

3167
02:21:19,399 --> 02:21:21,399
Yeah, it looks good on our end.

3168
02:21:21,399 --> 02:21:22,889
OK.

3169
02:21:22,889 --> 02:21:23,850
All right, it's Alex.

3170
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:24,889
Welcome to my home.

3171
02:21:25,450 --> 02:21:28,889
I went for the detail oriented approach

3172
02:21:28,889 --> 02:21:31,610
and we have a completely clean yard.

3173
02:21:32,170 --> 02:21:32,729
Oh, wait, hold on.

3174
02:21:32,729 --> 02:21:33,770
Restart, restart, restart.

3175
02:21:33,770 --> 02:21:36,090
Can you redo it and take away the text readability?

3176
02:21:36,090 --> 02:21:37,450
Because we might not need to do that

3177
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:43,049
because like we're both on the West Coast.

3178
02:21:43,049 --> 02:21:44,010
We're good, we're good, we got it.

3179
02:21:44,010 --> 02:21:44,889
Starting over.

3180
02:21:44,889 --> 02:21:45,690
We got it, we got it.

3181
02:21:47,770 --> 02:21:49,049
So smoother video instead?

3182
02:21:49,770 --> 02:21:52,409
Yeah, I think as long as you don't have to do the text mode thing,

3183
02:21:52,409 --> 02:21:53,450
you just have to check that box.

3184
02:21:56,879 --> 02:21:58,879
OK, how is that?

3185
02:21:58,879 --> 02:21:59,920
That looks better.

3186
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:00,559
Can you move around?

3187
02:22:02,649 --> 02:22:03,450
Hey, all right.

3188
02:22:03,450 --> 02:22:04,409
Looks good on our end.

3189
02:22:04,409 --> 02:22:06,250
OK, looks good.

3190
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:06,489
All right.

3191
02:22:06,489 --> 02:22:07,370
So what do we got?

3192
02:22:08,719 --> 02:22:09,120
All right.

3193
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:10,239
Welcome to my plot.

3194
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:15,020
We've got turf laid down on the entire plot.

3195
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:16,299
You won't find any weeds.

3196
02:22:16,299 --> 02:22:18,139
First of all, that's a full clap.

3197
02:22:18,139 --> 02:22:18,860
That's a full clap.

3198
02:22:19,739 --> 02:22:22,700
I can't believe you actually did this in 60 minutes, 70 minutes.

3199
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:26,299
This is a 100% clean backyard.

3200
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:27,840
Wow.

3201
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,879
And I'll show you the corner as well.

3202
02:22:30,879 --> 02:22:34,159
The turf changes as it gets in the back, but it's still turf.

3203
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:39,100
OK, so there won't there's no like there's no little ugly dirt spots.

3204
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:43,500
We have a nice suburban yard that we can have the kids go out and play.

3205
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:44,139
That sounds great.

3206
02:22:44,139 --> 02:22:44,379
All right.

3207
02:22:44,379 --> 02:22:50,040
So you're starting off at cleanliness at 100 right now, by the way.

3208
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:52,840
And we tried to get a little custom with the house

3209
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:55,079
and get some give us some paneling, give it some paint.

3210
02:22:55,639 --> 02:22:57,319
Now, let me take you inside.

3211
02:22:57,319 --> 02:22:59,879
So I just learned how to play house flipper yesterday

3212
02:22:59,879 --> 02:23:08,250
and I was under the impression that this is a house flipper competition.

3213
02:23:08,250 --> 02:23:10,010
So I have OK.

3214
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:13,690
All right. That's oh, that's pretty damn good.

3215
02:23:14,719 --> 02:23:19,479
I have to tell you that's actually for complexity sake.

3216
02:23:19,479 --> 02:23:20,559
Oh, yeah.

3217
02:23:20,559 --> 02:23:22,159
Yeah. All right.

3218
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:23,520
You're it's Alex.

3219
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:25,200
You're you're I got to listen.

3220
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,120
I got to tell you how complex this was.

3221
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:33,319
You're like a world first documented ability to do what you're seeing here.

3222
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:35,399
It's not on.

3223
02:23:35,399 --> 02:23:37,799
How did you even get the furniture to go upside down?

3224
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:44,639
Hours of trying to figure out how to do it after we did it on accident.

3225
02:23:44,959 --> 02:23:46,399
OK. OK. All right.

3226
02:23:46,399 --> 02:23:47,040
I'm feeling it.

3227
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:48,000
I put in the training.

3228
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:48,799
I put in the work.

3229
02:23:48,799 --> 02:23:53,180
I put in the preparation, but we knocked down all the walls

3230
02:23:53,180 --> 02:23:56,360
and gave it some, you know, a little flair.

3231
02:23:56,360 --> 02:23:58,920
You got you got a nice little sliding door.

3232
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:02,680
So far, you and Joel, you and Joel had different walls so far,

3233
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:05,559
except you might be noticing every season the same paint.

3234
02:24:05,559 --> 02:24:07,629
Everyone's got the same paint.

3235
02:24:07,629 --> 02:24:09,229
That's because it's landlord beige.

3236
02:24:09,229 --> 02:24:12,510
You know, it's just that's the start with.

3237
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:15,209
OK. OK. Give me some more.

3238
02:24:15,209 --> 02:24:21,129
We got some water flowing uphill because this is the house that is flipped.

3239
02:24:21,129 --> 02:24:24,860
OK. And we got like a nice little dining area.

3240
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:30,299
There's a piano here so that you can enjoy an elegant presentation

3241
02:24:30,299 --> 02:24:32,860
with your friends while you're having some food.

3242
02:24:32,860 --> 02:24:35,469
Beautiful. Oh, you even got the seats.

3243
02:24:35,469 --> 02:24:38,120
Did you do this through the whole house?

3244
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:42,120
Well, yes, but you're kind of you're looking at the whole house.

3245
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:46,040
The majority of the time was spent making sure that

3246
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:51,319
all of the little details like the exterior were taken care of and clean.

3247
02:24:52,590 --> 02:24:55,709
It's it's extremely clean. Look at that sheen on the wood.

3248
02:24:55,709 --> 02:24:59,610
You have the first person to show sheen on wood, by the way.

3249
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:05,920
So it took a long time to get all of the like we have a second floor paint job.

3250
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:11,680
We got paneling on the first exterior, actually put in some some windows

3251
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:15,040
and some sliding doors and like a proper front door.

3252
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:19,600
Got a nice little seating area with a big screen TV and some speakers.

3253
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:21,479
Is that an award on the table?

3254
02:25:21,479 --> 02:25:23,930
Yeah, that's my award for getting first place.

3255
02:25:23,930 --> 02:25:25,049
Oh, that's confidence.

3256
02:25:25,049 --> 02:25:26,409
Yeah, that philosophy.

3257
02:25:26,409 --> 02:25:28,250
I'm going to have to give you a 95 on that right now.

3258
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:31,770
That's honest to God.

3259
02:25:31,770 --> 02:25:32,729
That's a philosophy.

3260
02:25:32,729 --> 02:25:33,770
That is a vibe.

3261
02:25:33,770 --> 02:25:35,209
And it's you're up very high right now.

3262
02:25:35,209 --> 02:25:37,799
I just want to make sure you know that.

3263
02:25:37,799 --> 02:25:39,979
Thank you. I appreciate being recognized.

3264
02:25:39,979 --> 02:25:44,569
Sometimes overconfidence can be a little bit of a downfall.

3265
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:46,729
So philosophy is going from a 95 to a 93.

3266
02:25:46,809 --> 02:25:50,040
Look at the fish.

3267
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:51,579
They can fill it with.

3268
02:25:51,579 --> 02:25:55,370
Oh, you actually can go upside down.

3269
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:56,170
Oh, yeah.

3270
02:25:56,170 --> 02:25:57,129
Wait, do it again.

3271
02:26:00,059 --> 02:26:00,459
I'm sorry.

3272
02:26:00,459 --> 02:26:01,420
I got to apologize.

3273
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:04,780
We presented the house in the wrong way.

3274
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:10,510
I want to make sure I win the house flipper competition.

3275
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:11,069
It's Alex.

3276
02:26:11,069 --> 02:26:13,319
I don't know if anyone's going to beat you.

3277
02:26:13,319 --> 02:26:15,559
I don't think anyone's going to come close.

3278
02:26:15,559 --> 02:26:17,079
I don't think anyone's going to come close.

3279
02:26:17,079 --> 02:26:21,399
If you'd like to sit and enjoy the TV or check on the neighbors

3280
02:26:21,399 --> 02:26:22,920
outside through the front window.

3281
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:27,159
Yeah, that was I mean, I don't I mean, what do I do about this?

3282
02:26:27,639 --> 02:26:29,399
This is this was Connor's grades.

3283
02:26:29,399 --> 02:26:30,940
Hold on a second here.

3284
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:32,139
We got you out of creativity.

3285
02:26:32,139 --> 02:26:32,860
We got you out.

3286
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:35,180
I got you out of 95 for creativity.

3287
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:37,930
I got you out of 100 for complexity.

3288
02:26:37,930 --> 02:26:45,610
I've got you at a 100 for cleanliness, although this can come down from here.

3289
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:50,010
Well, the cleanliness can't go down because this is I can show you the upstairs.

3290
02:26:50,649 --> 02:26:51,770
That's what I'm concerned about.

3291
02:26:53,209 --> 02:26:57,530
It took so long to get all these other beautiful details just so that

3292
02:26:58,430 --> 02:27:00,829
I had to choose my focus.

3293
02:27:00,829 --> 02:27:01,309
That's true.

3294
02:27:01,309 --> 02:27:06,510
Just try to get the downstairs as much as possible in a very short amount of time.

3295
02:27:06,510 --> 02:27:09,579
But, you know, you've got like at least a urinals.

3296
02:27:09,579 --> 02:27:10,379
Oh, yeah.

3297
02:27:10,379 --> 02:27:12,799
Just that reveal I got.

3298
02:27:12,799 --> 02:27:15,120
That flip reveal is going to be living here.

3299
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:17,200
You know, the urinals get dirty after a while.

3300
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,040
So you want to be able to switch to the other ones.

3301
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:22,299
OK, I like it.

3302
02:27:22,299 --> 02:27:23,819
My I didn't do this.

3303
02:27:24,780 --> 02:27:25,979
The sink is leaky.

3304
02:27:27,229 --> 02:27:28,030
This is just fault.

3305
02:27:28,030 --> 02:27:28,750
I'm taking this back.

3306
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:34,639
Is it water damage underneath them?

3307
02:27:34,639 --> 02:27:35,840
It's still under warranty.

3308
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:36,750
OK.

3309
02:27:36,750 --> 02:27:36,989
All right.

3310
02:27:36,989 --> 02:27:37,870
What is it?

3311
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:40,459
Can you go up or down technically?

3312
02:27:40,459 --> 02:27:40,940
I can.

3313
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:42,139
It's clean.

3314
02:27:42,139 --> 02:27:44,379
Oh, but it's just it's twisted that way.

3315
02:27:44,379 --> 02:27:45,100
All right.

3316
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:45,739
Yep.

3317
02:27:45,739 --> 02:27:49,020
The majority the majority of the time was spent.

3318
02:27:49,020 --> 02:27:50,540
All right.

3319
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:52,459
This was this was phenomenal.

3320
02:27:53,389 --> 02:27:56,989
I will have to tell you this is probably up and also probably number one so far.

3321
02:27:56,989 --> 02:27:58,190
But there is no number one.

3322
02:27:59,069 --> 02:28:01,149
We scared off the moles outside.

3323
02:28:01,149 --> 02:28:03,739
OK, we dug up all the holes.

3324
02:28:03,739 --> 02:28:04,860
Oh, there's no tires.

3325
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:06,059
There's no weeds.

3326
02:28:06,059 --> 02:28:08,059
It is a clean cut all the way across.

3327
02:28:08,059 --> 02:28:10,139
I was told the outside is very important.

3328
02:28:10,139 --> 02:28:11,260
Where's the maze?

3329
02:28:11,260 --> 02:28:11,739
Oh, yeah.

3330
02:28:11,739 --> 02:28:12,540
Where's the maze?

3331
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:13,930
Open the garage.

3332
02:28:13,930 --> 02:28:19,639
I want to see in the garage and I want to see every corner of the garage.

3333
02:28:19,639 --> 02:28:20,840
You didn't just put everything in here, right?

3334
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:22,280
You didn't just put all the chairs and stuff in here.

3335
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:26,250
No, you can you can actually put two cars in this two car garage.

3336
02:28:26,250 --> 02:28:27,770
Actually using for cars.

3337
02:28:31,959 --> 02:28:33,879
I thought there was going to be a very short.

3338
02:28:33,879 --> 02:28:36,840
I'm going to I'm going to emphasize brevity in my presentation.

3339
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:39,000
You've seen it.

3340
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:39,479
This is it.

3341
02:28:39,479 --> 02:28:41,719
I have the house flipped house.

3342
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:43,879
I think so.

3343
02:28:43,879 --> 02:28:44,920
Chat, what's your grade?

3344
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:46,520
Go ahead and give it A, B, C or D.

3345
02:28:47,719 --> 02:28:49,959
I'm going to have to go ahead and say that for your complexity,

3346
02:28:49,959 --> 02:28:52,280
complexity carries this the whole time.

3347
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:55,479
I think that you being able to flip that and turn it the way

3348
02:28:56,299 --> 02:28:58,780
that was an unbelievably huge deal.

3349
02:28:58,780 --> 02:29:02,350
I think that one of the reasons why hold on.

3350
02:29:02,350 --> 02:29:02,989
Oops.

3351
02:29:02,989 --> 02:29:06,110
OK, one of the reasons why you're going to be up there pretty high

3352
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:10,350
is because of the flip reveal, not just the fact that you did flip it,

3353
02:29:10,350 --> 02:29:13,950
but the fact that I and everybody watching it was built entirely upside down.

3354
02:29:13,950 --> 02:29:14,989
It was built entirely upset.

3355
02:29:14,989 --> 02:29:16,909
Center here was put upside down.

3356
02:29:17,770 --> 02:29:19,049
That was a phenomenal, phenomenal presentation.

3357
02:29:19,049 --> 02:29:23,290
You physically cannot do it without being upside down.

3358
02:29:23,290 --> 02:29:26,250
And the way that you get upside down is actually so secret

3359
02:29:26,250 --> 02:29:28,170
that it isn't even on the wiki for this game.

3360
02:29:28,170 --> 02:29:30,940
We discovered it on accident.

3361
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:35,069
What do you mean we like I I practiced yesterday

3362
02:29:35,069 --> 02:29:36,670
so I could understand how to play the game.

3363
02:29:36,670 --> 02:29:37,790
You know, I got familiar with it.

3364
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:38,590
OK, OK.

3365
02:29:38,590 --> 02:29:42,059
I thought you meant like somebody in chat told you to do that.

3366
02:29:42,059 --> 02:29:44,860
No, I flipped upside down and then we spent an hour and a half

3367
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:45,819
trying to figure out how to do it.

3368
02:29:45,819 --> 02:29:47,340
Oh, OK.

3369
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:47,819
All right.

3370
02:29:47,819 --> 02:29:48,299
All right.

3371
02:29:48,299 --> 02:29:49,549
That's all right.

3372
02:29:49,549 --> 02:29:49,870
Here you go.

3373
02:29:49,870 --> 02:29:50,920
Here are your grades.

3374
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:53,719
You got a 95 for creativity.

3375
02:29:53,719 --> 02:29:56,329
You got 100 for complexity.

3376
02:29:56,329 --> 02:29:58,090
You get a 100 for cleanliness.

3377
02:29:58,090 --> 02:29:58,889
This is a very good.

3378
02:29:58,889 --> 02:30:00,329
This is a very good grade.

3379
02:30:00,329 --> 02:30:02,489
Your philosophy is a 93.

3380
02:30:02,489 --> 02:30:05,850
The only thing that I'm going to do here is I'm going to bring it down to a 90.

3381
02:30:05,850 --> 02:30:10,809
And I'll tell you one reason why the whole house was built around

3382
02:30:10,809 --> 02:30:13,579
and going upside down everything.

3383
02:30:13,579 --> 02:30:17,420
And there's no second floor and there's no basement.

3384
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:18,860
And the garage is empty.

3385
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:19,840
That's fair.

3386
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:24,239
But I thought that having quality individual rooms would make up for

3387
02:30:24,239 --> 02:30:27,920
instead of having like a bunch of things scattered around.

3388
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:29,840
You know, I went through quality over quantity.

3389
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:31,200
You did, which is why you still get an A.

3390
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:31,920
And you know, I'll make it.

3391
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:35,579
I'll make it a 92.

3392
02:30:35,579 --> 02:30:38,219
So chat gave you an A, which is a 95.

3393
02:30:38,219 --> 02:30:43,000
Nobody can get a 100 that this is the cleanest yard you'll see today.

3394
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,760
That is that's a huge deal, dude.

3395
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:50,879
Because seriously, like having a fully clean yard with grass planted.

3396
02:30:50,879 --> 02:30:51,760
Big deal.

3397
02:30:52,159 --> 02:30:54,559
This took almost one third of the total time.

3398
02:30:54,559 --> 02:30:55,280
Yeah.

3399
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,959
Your total final grade.

3400
02:30:56,959 --> 02:30:58,000
Congratulations, italics.

3401
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:03,120
You are currently the head of the class with a 96.5.

3402
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,260
I'll take it.

3403
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:05,979
I appreciate it.

3404
02:31:05,979 --> 02:31:10,729
96.5 for italics was a hell of a job.

3405
02:31:10,729 --> 02:31:11,450
And nobody wins.

3406
02:31:11,450 --> 02:31:12,170
Did chat already vote?

3407
02:31:12,809 --> 02:31:13,129
Chat did.

3408
02:31:13,129 --> 02:31:14,940
They gave you an A.

3409
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:15,899
So you're at 96.

3410
02:31:15,899 --> 02:31:17,500
96.5.

3411
02:31:17,500 --> 02:31:18,620
Well, yeah, I rounded it up.

3412
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:21,659
But by the way, now that I've gotten scored, I can share my secret.

3413
02:31:21,659 --> 02:31:21,899
Yeah.

3414
02:31:23,239 --> 02:31:25,639
If you have cheats enabled and you type,

3415
02:31:25,639 --> 02:31:26,920
you don't even have to open a window.

3416
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:28,680
You can just type it into the game.

3417
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:29,799
G-R-A-V.

3418
02:31:29,799 --> 02:31:31,420
That's how you flip it.

3419
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:34,799
That's the graph cheat that we discovered.

3420
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:37,920
Before you go real quick, can you just give the philosophy

3421
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:41,040
on what is going on with the red and the kind of metal here?

3422
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:44,809
Because that's one thing that I'm kind of reconsidering.

3423
02:31:44,809 --> 02:31:48,909
Well, we were going for something that had kind of a classic vibe,

3424
02:31:48,909 --> 02:31:51,469
but you'll notice that it does match the interior a little bit.

3425
02:31:51,469 --> 02:31:57,469
Like we have this wallpaper here with the skulls, like the Day of the Dead type of skulls.

3426
02:31:57,469 --> 02:31:58,510
Everybody's calling you a cheater.

3427
02:31:59,469 --> 02:32:00,829
Yeah, that didn't work.

3428
02:32:00,829 --> 02:32:04,040
We're all cheaters.

3429
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:09,479
Hey, I didn't say you couldn't.

3430
02:32:09,479 --> 02:32:12,760
I didn't say you couldn't do these things.

3431
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:15,479
If anything, he spent the extra time to figure that out.

3432
02:32:15,479 --> 02:32:17,950
So that's the grade.

3433
02:32:17,950 --> 02:32:19,389
You got a 96.5.

3434
02:32:19,389 --> 02:32:24,159
I'm just a magician sharing my secrets so other people can enjoy.

3435
02:32:26,190 --> 02:32:28,430
Instead of keeping it to myself arbitrarily.

3436
02:32:28,430 --> 02:32:32,250
All right, we're ready for the next person.

3437
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:34,649
Coming up next, whose house is next?

3438
02:32:34,649 --> 02:32:36,729
I believe it is Vinny.

3439
02:32:37,559 --> 02:32:39,399
Vinny, I believe you are next.

3440
02:32:39,399 --> 02:32:40,280
Thank you, Italics.

3441
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:42,120
Congratulations for being head of the class so far.

3442
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:43,159
I appreciate it.

3443
02:32:43,159 --> 02:32:44,360
Great job, Italics.

3444
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:44,920
Yeah, hell yeah.

3445
02:32:45,719 --> 02:32:46,920
Do we want to get some...

3446
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:47,879
Anybody else want to say anything?

3447
02:32:47,879 --> 02:32:49,319
I mean, we could do that too.

3448
02:32:49,319 --> 02:32:49,879
I mean, I don't know.

3449
02:32:49,879 --> 02:32:51,319
I want to make it extend for too long.

3450
02:32:51,319 --> 02:32:53,159
But what does the class think?

3451
02:32:56,829 --> 02:32:57,709
There was no maze.

3452
02:32:58,590 --> 02:32:59,790
I thought that was part of the criteria.

3453
02:32:59,790 --> 02:33:00,510
What was the maze?

3454
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:01,229
Yeah, I was...

3455
02:33:01,229 --> 02:33:02,030
What was the maze?

3456
02:33:02,030 --> 02:33:02,670
By the way, it's no maze.

3457
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:04,989
I think he's really flipped the house.

3458
02:33:04,989 --> 02:33:06,750
Hoke, are you still cheating?

3459
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:08,829
I think cheating is not fair.

3460
02:33:08,829 --> 02:33:10,270
Yeah, cheating is on its land.

3461
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:10,829
I'm ready.

3462
02:33:10,829 --> 02:33:12,270
I'm ready to say something, Hoke.

3463
02:33:12,270 --> 02:33:14,030
Thanks for saying something, Hoke.

3464
02:33:14,030 --> 02:33:15,229
That's ironic coming from the person

3465
02:33:15,229 --> 02:33:17,469
who got like 30 extra minutes to build compared to the rest.

3466
02:33:17,469 --> 02:33:19,389
I used only 20 of those.

3467
02:33:20,670 --> 02:33:22,989
A genuinely 20 of those.

3468
02:33:22,989 --> 02:33:24,190
I was at the aquarium.

3469
02:33:24,190 --> 02:33:25,629
He was at the aquarium, everybody.

3470
02:33:25,629 --> 02:33:26,430
All right, it's all right.

3471
02:33:26,430 --> 02:33:28,250
We gave him the time.

3472
02:33:28,250 --> 02:33:30,170
I do absolutely love Italics' home,

3473
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:32,969
but he is missing a complete second story.

3474
02:33:32,969 --> 02:33:34,250
There's nothing there.

3475
02:33:34,809 --> 02:33:36,170
Well, but hold on.

3476
02:33:36,170 --> 02:33:36,889
I'll be sticking around for it.

3477
02:33:36,889 --> 02:33:37,450
I'm not next.

3478
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:38,170
I'm not next.

3479
02:33:38,170 --> 02:33:39,049
I love it, though.

3480
02:33:39,049 --> 02:33:39,690
I love it, though.

3481
02:33:39,690 --> 02:33:40,889
Hold on.

3482
02:33:40,889 --> 02:33:42,649
But remember, we're talking about creativity

3483
02:33:42,649 --> 02:33:44,090
is 35% of your total grade.

3484
02:33:45,440 --> 02:33:48,000
I mean, flipping the house halfway through

3485
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,680
and doing a big fucking reveal.

3486
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:50,479
That was a holy.

3487
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:52,959
My expectations were not going there.

3488
02:33:52,959 --> 02:33:54,159
I gasped, you know.

3489
02:33:54,159 --> 02:33:55,040
I actually was.

3490
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:56,000
That was amazing.

3491
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,200
That was amazing.

3492
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:58,639
Yeah, I was just waiting for the maze.

3493
02:33:58,639 --> 02:34:01,180
That was the prestige.

3494
02:34:01,180 --> 02:34:02,139
But it was incredible.

3495
02:34:02,139 --> 02:34:03,040
I loved it.

3496
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:05,840
Why was the bathroom not flipped like the rest of it?

3497
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:08,639
Oh, the bathroom is not upside down.

3498
02:34:08,639 --> 02:34:10,399
They caught that too, but I didn't say anything.

3499
02:34:10,399 --> 02:34:12,000
The science is in there.

3500
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,079
The science isn't there for the plumbing.

3501
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:15,760
They won't let you put pipes upside down.

3502
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:19,280
So I figured something was better than another.

3503
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:20,879
I tried to put something in the room.

3504
02:34:20,879 --> 02:34:23,200
I love how somebody said House Flipper Drama is insane.

3505
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:26,000
House Flipper Drama.

3506
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:29,680
House Flipper Drama is insane.

3507
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:33,020
House Flipper Community is going to be in shambles after tonight.

3508
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:33,659
Hey, well, guess what?

3509
02:34:33,659 --> 02:34:35,020
This is the House Flipper Community.

3510
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:36,059
We're literally all here now.

3511
02:34:39,469 --> 02:34:41,149
All right, let's get Vinnie in here.

3512
02:34:41,149 --> 02:34:42,590
So, Talos, thank you.

3513
02:34:42,590 --> 02:34:43,870
Thank you once again.

3514
02:34:43,950 --> 02:34:44,350
Thank you.

3515
02:34:44,350 --> 02:34:44,590
Thank you.

3516
02:34:44,590 --> 02:34:45,389
Appreciate it.

3517
02:34:45,389 --> 02:34:46,270
Chad, thanks for the A.

3518
02:34:46,829 --> 02:34:48,040
You're a real one.

3519
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:49,370
Thanks, Talos.

3520
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:50,989
So Vinnie, same deal.

3521
02:34:50,989 --> 02:34:51,870
I'm live, charm.

3522
02:34:51,870 --> 02:34:52,190
If you...

3523
02:34:52,989 --> 02:34:56,700
Yeah, make sure, Talos, you turn your stream off before I open this one.

3524
02:34:56,700 --> 02:34:57,659
And then, Vinnie, did you do the...

3525
02:34:58,459 --> 02:34:59,180
You know, I don't think you...

3526
02:34:59,180 --> 02:35:01,260
Because obviously, if you were in the United States,

3527
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:04,200
I don't think we have to do the thingy.

3528
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:05,159
Let me know how this looks.

3529
02:35:05,159 --> 02:35:07,739
I'm going to just look around and tell me if this is...

3530
02:35:07,739 --> 02:35:09,819
It's 30 FPS, but it should be kind of smooth.

3531
02:35:09,819 --> 02:35:11,239
Looks good.

3532
02:35:11,239 --> 02:35:11,879
All right.

3533
02:35:11,879 --> 02:35:13,559
All right, I am ready for you to begin.

3534
02:35:13,559 --> 02:35:14,600
I'm going to take your grades.

3535
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:15,799
Let me just change this real quick

3536
02:35:15,799 --> 02:35:16,920
because these are not your grades.

3537
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:18,909
These are Italics' grades.

3538
02:35:18,909 --> 02:35:20,059
Okay.

3539
02:35:20,059 --> 02:35:23,520
I will tell you when we are ready to get the tour.

3540
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:23,840
Sure.

3541
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:28,700
Okay. Vinnie, please begin.

3542
02:35:28,700 --> 02:35:29,979
Sure. Well, first of all, Jerma,

3543
02:35:29,979 --> 02:35:31,819
thank you so much for having me.

3544
02:35:31,819 --> 02:35:33,579
It's really just a pleasure to be here.

3545
02:35:34,299 --> 02:35:36,780
I would like to emphasize that I did not cheat

3546
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:39,180
while making my house flipper house.

3547
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:39,819
Okay.

3548
02:35:39,819 --> 02:35:43,760
And so what you'll be seeing today is legitimate.

3549
02:35:45,579 --> 02:35:46,620
Now, the yard isn't...

3550
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:48,299
Am I getting subquitted right now?

3551
02:35:48,299 --> 02:35:50,459
I think we lost some quality.

3552
02:35:52,139 --> 02:35:52,700
Oh, really?

3553
02:35:52,700 --> 02:35:54,059
It looked good for the first five seconds.

3554
02:35:54,059 --> 02:35:56,059
Are you on 30 FPS?

3555
02:35:56,059 --> 02:35:56,920
Yeah.

3556
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:57,959
Are you? It looks like you're at 60.

3557
02:35:59,209 --> 02:36:03,159
Let me try taking a quick look here.

3558
02:36:03,159 --> 02:36:04,200
It says 30.

3559
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:04,920
Yeah.

3560
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:08,520
You want me to go down to 720p or try 60?

3561
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:15,440
Dude, take it down to 720.

3562
02:36:15,440 --> 02:36:17,920
I think the better reading mode worked pretty well.

3563
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:18,479
Yeah.

3564
02:36:18,479 --> 02:36:19,920
Like, how do you do that?

3565
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:23,020
I think if you did this a box, it's like,

3566
02:36:23,020 --> 02:36:24,540
see, just show text better.

3567
02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:28,430
It's like a checkbox you can do.

3568
02:36:28,430 --> 02:36:29,549
Yeah, I don't see that.

3569
02:36:31,129 --> 02:36:32,409
Where was I on this?

3570
02:36:32,409 --> 02:36:33,850
It should be on the drop down.

3571
02:36:33,850 --> 02:36:34,889
See how this is.

3572
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:39,200
Oh, that's better.

3573
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,420
That's better.

3574
02:36:41,420 --> 02:36:42,139
How we feel on this?

3575
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:45,209
This looks a little better.

3576
02:36:45,209 --> 02:36:45,930
Yeah, I think this is good.

3577
02:36:45,930 --> 02:36:46,729
Yeah, I don't see it.

3578
02:36:46,729 --> 02:36:47,209
It's weird.

3579
02:36:47,209 --> 02:36:49,690
I don't see it in the drop down at all, actually.

3580
02:36:49,690 --> 02:36:50,569
Very strange.

3581
02:36:50,569 --> 02:36:51,290
I think this is good.

3582
02:36:51,290 --> 02:36:52,649
I think this is clear enough, I think.

3583
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:54,959
Okay.

3584
02:36:54,959 --> 02:36:55,680
All righty.

3585
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,520
Well, anyway, like I said, so yeah,

3586
02:36:57,520 --> 02:36:59,280
the yard is your basic yard.

3587
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:00,959
It's just kind of, you know, natural.

3588
02:37:00,959 --> 02:37:02,239
It's just, I left it natural.

3589
02:37:02,239 --> 02:37:03,600
I gave it a little koi pond.

3590
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:03,840
Okay.

3591
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:09,600
Nothing special in there, but I can tell you the feature of the house is,

3592
02:37:10,159 --> 02:37:11,440
you know, we got some nice paint.

3593
02:37:12,879 --> 02:37:13,920
Let me take you inside.

3594
02:37:15,799 --> 02:37:17,479
So as you can see, I've got furniture.

3595
02:37:18,909 --> 02:37:20,510
You do have furniture.

3596
02:37:20,510 --> 02:37:21,959
I've got a picture of my family.

3597
02:37:24,239 --> 02:37:27,340
I've got my favorite ducks from Animal Crossing.

3598
02:37:28,159 --> 02:37:29,840
So you see, it's like a proper home.

3599
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:35,129
I have, there's Simon Cowell and Howard the Duck.

3600
02:37:35,129 --> 02:37:37,610
So lots of important people in my life.

3601
02:37:38,170 --> 02:37:41,899
Okay, so this is more of a personal touch.

3602
02:37:41,899 --> 02:37:42,379
It is.

3603
02:37:42,379 --> 02:37:43,260
It's rustic.

3604
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:45,340
I'm going for the rustic feel.

3605
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:47,500
And you can see we even got a nice accent wall.

3606
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:50,329
We don't go in this room.

3607
02:37:50,329 --> 02:37:51,290
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3608
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:51,610
Wait a minute.

3609
02:37:51,610 --> 02:37:51,930
Go back.

3610
02:37:54,280 --> 02:37:55,159
We don't go in this room.

3611
02:37:55,159 --> 02:37:55,959
What do you mean?

3612
02:37:55,959 --> 02:37:59,959
It's just, it's not a room I would recommend going in.

3613
02:37:59,959 --> 02:38:02,940
Open that door.

3614
02:38:02,940 --> 02:38:03,739
Open that door.

3615
02:38:03,739 --> 02:38:04,860
I need to see the whole house.

3616
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:11,879
Okay.

3617
02:38:11,879 --> 02:38:13,159
Leave the, leave and close the door.

3618
02:38:13,879 --> 02:38:14,760
Don't show me that again.

3619
02:38:15,690 --> 02:38:21,549
So in here we have the hybrid kitchen and bathroom.

3620
02:38:21,549 --> 02:38:21,870
Okay.

3621
02:38:21,870 --> 02:38:22,909
So there's a shower.

3622
02:38:22,909 --> 02:38:28,079
So there's a nice carpet here for the bathroom kitchen.

3623
02:38:29,559 --> 02:38:32,280
You've got a nice toilet.

3624
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:34,920
You got an iPad right next to the toilet.

3625
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:35,239
Good.

3626
02:38:35,239 --> 02:38:36,200
You may need that.

3627
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:37,239
I use it a lot.

3628
02:38:37,239 --> 02:38:39,840
Put that on the dishwasher right there.

3629
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:41,739
Got some cabinets.

3630
02:38:42,459 --> 02:38:43,340
Urinal.

3631
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:46,540
So when you're cooking and you're busy on the stove here,

3632
02:38:46,540 --> 02:38:48,319
you can take a quick piss.

3633
02:38:49,260 --> 02:38:52,729
Use your soap and go back to cooking.

3634
02:38:52,729 --> 02:38:55,209
And the carpet is just a really nice feature

3635
02:38:55,209 --> 02:38:57,209
because it just makes it comfortable.

3636
02:38:57,209 --> 02:38:59,290
Because when you're cooking and you're in a kitchen,

3637
02:39:01,159 --> 02:39:02,440
you're moving around a lot.

3638
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:05,319
So the carpet really takes some of the,

3639
02:39:05,319 --> 02:39:08,829
some of the wear off of that equation.

3640
02:39:08,829 --> 02:39:09,709
I do appreciate,

3641
02:39:09,709 --> 02:39:11,629
I do appreciate the like the throw up color

3642
02:39:11,629 --> 02:39:12,750
that you have for the carpet.

3643
02:39:12,750 --> 02:39:14,030
That's very nice.

3644
02:39:14,030 --> 02:39:15,069
It hides all the,

3645
02:39:15,069 --> 02:39:16,829
it hides all the potential kitchen mess.

3646
02:39:16,829 --> 02:39:18,940
So you know, you spill shit on the ground.

3647
02:39:18,940 --> 02:39:20,159
That's fine.

3648
02:39:20,159 --> 02:39:22,750
And piss stains and the like.

3649
02:39:22,750 --> 02:39:24,989
So yeah, really, I think it's just a nice thing.

3650
02:39:24,989 --> 02:39:27,389
And it's really an underutilized concept.

3651
02:39:27,389 --> 02:39:29,870
The kitchenette, bathroom combo.

3652
02:39:29,870 --> 02:39:32,989
And also the Grey Leno show is the greatest late night show

3653
02:39:32,989 --> 02:39:33,629
of all time.

3654
02:39:34,350 --> 02:39:36,780
So then, as you know,

3655
02:39:36,780 --> 02:39:38,620
so I'll show you the upstairs real quick.

3656
02:39:38,620 --> 02:39:40,750
So, you know, I didn't quite-

3657
02:39:40,750 --> 02:39:43,629
Go back, how many times have we seen this image already?

3658
02:39:43,629 --> 02:39:45,040
Haven't we?

3659
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:45,600
Which one?

3660
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:46,000
That one.

3661
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Is, no, that's just like a type of image.

3662
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,319
No, the one on the left.

3663
02:39:51,319 --> 02:39:52,280
Oh, that's just me.

3664
02:39:53,209 --> 02:39:55,500
Like put through a filter a couple of times.

3665
02:39:55,500 --> 02:39:57,020
I just thought it would be nice to have that there.

3666
02:39:57,020 --> 02:39:58,540
Connor, are you, you're watching right now, right?

3667
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:05,020
There's a version of my face that has this same face

3668
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:06,780
on his Japanese Google.

3669
02:40:06,780 --> 02:40:08,620
Yeah, not on Japanese Google.

3670
02:40:08,620 --> 02:40:09,020
Sorry.

3671
02:40:09,020 --> 02:40:09,500
Oh, okay.

3672
02:40:11,149 --> 02:40:11,629
Oh, okay.

3673
02:40:11,629 --> 02:40:12,809
All right.

3674
02:40:12,809 --> 02:40:15,290
I do like the, I love, before you say anything,

3675
02:40:15,850 --> 02:40:17,549
I love the wallpaper.

3676
02:40:17,549 --> 02:40:18,430
I think it's very fun.

3677
02:40:18,430 --> 02:40:19,149
Oh, thanks.

3678
02:40:19,149 --> 02:40:22,040
It's cool.

3679
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:25,959
Yeah, there's definitely a nice vibe to the room.

3680
02:40:25,959 --> 02:40:28,360
I tried to find sand flooring, but I like this better.

3681
02:40:29,239 --> 02:40:30,280
I have some photos.

3682
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:32,840
I was going to do a little photo gallery of the evolution

3683
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:37,500
of our image together from acts like six years ago,

3684
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:40,700
five years ago, to the most recent thing,

3685
02:40:40,700 --> 02:40:41,579
because we're buddies.

3686
02:40:41,579 --> 02:40:43,579
You know, me, you and Kraikin, we're good buddies.

3687
02:40:43,579 --> 02:40:44,079
Yeah.

3688
02:40:45,639 --> 02:40:50,280
And so anyway, this is my alien, Nortz, and he's smiling.

3689
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:54,059
Here's the gamer chair, the desk.

3690
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:56,879
Back to the gamer chair.

3691
02:40:56,879 --> 02:40:58,479
There's a gun next to the gamer chair.

3692
02:40:58,479 --> 02:41:00,079
I'm just, I'm just asking a question.

3693
02:41:02,090 --> 02:41:02,889
What do you want to know about it?

3694
02:41:02,889 --> 02:41:05,979
Why is there a gun next to the gamer chair?

3695
02:41:05,979 --> 02:41:09,180
Why isn't there a gun next to the gamer chair?

3696
02:41:09,180 --> 02:41:13,659
Okay, fair, fair, okay, okay, fair.

3697
02:41:13,659 --> 02:41:17,180
Um, here's the bed and, uh.

3698
02:41:17,180 --> 02:41:17,899
Why is there mirrors?

3699
02:41:17,899 --> 02:41:20,139
Surrounding, surrounding mirrors.

3700
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:25,280
Well, this is, I mean, this is the implication,

3701
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:26,559
really, more than anything.

3702
02:41:26,559 --> 02:41:28,000
Are you a vampire?

3703
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,219
I mean, some, some would say a sex vampire.

3704
02:41:32,219 --> 02:41:34,059
Who, who can't see the vampires,

3705
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:35,260
can't see the reflection or something?

3706
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:36,940
Why would you have mirrors everywhere?

3707
02:41:40,649 --> 02:41:41,290
Wait a second.

3708
02:41:42,250 --> 02:41:42,969
Wait a second.

3709
02:41:42,969 --> 02:41:44,649
Uh, uh, this is clicking right now.

3710
02:41:44,649 --> 02:41:46,649
This is clicking right now.

3711
02:41:46,649 --> 02:41:46,889
Um.

3712
02:41:46,889 --> 02:41:47,450
Cool.

3713
02:41:47,450 --> 02:41:49,559
But what do you think it is?

3714
02:41:49,559 --> 02:41:53,739
Are you, are these all here for you to-

3715
02:41:53,739 --> 02:41:55,420
So anyway, down this way,

3716
02:41:55,420 --> 02:41:59,920
I'll show you another, uh, cool, uh, feature of the house.

3717
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:02,559
So, you know, there's toilets pretty much in every main room.

3718
02:42:04,250 --> 02:42:07,739
But then here we have, probably,

3719
02:42:08,299 --> 02:42:10,280
I don't know, the grimace room, you could call it.

3720
02:42:10,280 --> 02:42:14,399
There was an accident happened here.

3721
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:16,750
But, uh, there is a toilet and-

3722
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:19,629
We'll go back to the wall.

3723
02:42:19,629 --> 02:42:20,430
Go back to the wall.

3724
02:42:21,149 --> 02:42:25,610
That, that, is that, that's Mr., is that Mr. Dink?

3725
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:27,709
Yeah.

3726
02:42:27,709 --> 02:42:28,590
Well, he's purple.

3727
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:30,590
And I feel like him and grimace probably had,

3728
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:32,780
like, something to do with each other.

3729
02:42:32,780 --> 02:42:36,030
I don't know what, but I'm, I'm trying to find out the connection.

3730
02:42:36,030 --> 02:42:38,590
Vinnie, Vinnie, I wanna, I wanna interject for a second here.

3731
02:42:38,590 --> 02:42:41,629
I do have to drop a couple points on philosophy and creativity

3732
02:42:41,629 --> 02:42:43,309
because I'm saying, I'm seeing a theme that,

3733
02:42:43,309 --> 02:42:45,229
did you paint the outside of the house purple

3734
02:42:45,229 --> 02:42:46,989
because this grimace room existed?

3735
02:42:46,989 --> 02:42:48,989
And that was the first thing you did.

3736
02:42:48,989 --> 02:42:53,040
And then you said, shit, I can't just make a grimace house.

3737
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:54,719
No, I started with the grimace room.

3738
02:42:54,719 --> 02:42:56,479
That, yeah, that's what I, okay.

3739
02:42:56,479 --> 02:43:01,280
Yeah, I knew the grimace room would have to be, like, really important to the room.

3740
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:01,520
Okay.

3741
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:03,280
And, uh, we got the summoning circle here.

3742
02:43:03,280 --> 02:43:09,069
Well, it's more of a summoning cube, but it worked.

3743
02:43:09,069 --> 02:43:11,549
And so, uh, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.

3744
02:43:11,549 --> 02:43:13,709
I don't have anything of note to show you back here

3745
02:43:13,709 --> 02:43:16,110
because I spent a lot of time trying to get-

3746
02:43:16,829 --> 02:43:17,629
Can you go to the garage?

3747
02:43:17,629 --> 02:43:19,069
This all rustic and nice.

3748
02:43:19,069 --> 02:43:19,870
There's nothing in there.

3749
02:43:20,829 --> 02:43:22,190
But can you go to the left of the garage?

3750
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:30,139
Oh, Vinnie, oh, Vinnie, Vinnie.

3751
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:33,719
Oh, Vinnie.

3752
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:35,690
It's dirty back there.

3753
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,579
It's pretty dirty back there.

3754
02:43:39,579 --> 02:43:42,860
Hey, Jerma, can you take a look on Japanese Google real quick

3755
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:46,139
and check, um, for a photo of you, if you wouldn't mind?

3756
02:43:49,340 --> 02:43:53,659
Anyway, so, yeah, the Mr. Dink connection is really,

3757
02:43:53,659 --> 02:43:55,500
oh, really interesting, isn't it?

3758
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:56,379
That connection between-

3759
02:43:56,379 --> 02:43:58,059
I actually do like the Mr. Dink.

3760
02:43:58,059 --> 02:44:00,620
Oh, I forgot to play the dramatic sound from Hell's Kitchen.

3761
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:02,799
Hold on.

3762
02:44:02,799 --> 02:44:13,069
Ah, this, you've got lots of dirt back there.

3763
02:44:13,069 --> 02:44:14,909
I thought that was the YouTube video that I just opened.

3764
02:44:15,389 --> 02:44:17,600
Okay, that was-

3765
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:21,370
Listen, I'm happy that you're here in my house.

3766
02:44:21,370 --> 02:44:23,049
I thought that was a different YouTube video.

3767
02:44:23,049 --> 02:44:24,010
I just tried to play the-

3768
02:44:24,010 --> 02:44:24,969
Okay, all right, here we go.

3769
02:44:25,610 --> 02:44:27,950
Vinnie, good shit.

3770
02:44:27,950 --> 02:44:29,309
I liked your philosophy.

3771
02:44:29,309 --> 02:44:30,750
I thought your creativity was great.

3772
02:44:30,750 --> 02:44:34,670
I love the fact that you have your multi-kitchen bathroom area.

3773
02:44:34,670 --> 02:44:35,229
Fantastic.

3774
02:44:35,229 --> 02:44:38,219
I'm going to give you an extra point in philosophy on that one.

3775
02:44:38,219 --> 02:44:40,059
Your cleanliness could be a little bit higher.

3776
02:44:40,059 --> 02:44:41,899
I'll give you a 90 because it was just that one area.

3777
02:44:41,899 --> 02:44:44,219
But, I mean, actually, never mind.

3778
02:44:44,219 --> 02:44:45,579
You shouldn't have shown me that room more than once

3779
02:44:46,379 --> 02:44:48,299
because I forgot it existed in this blood all over the walls.

3780
02:44:48,299 --> 02:44:49,340
You got a C in cleanliness.

3781
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:51,639
All right, so here you go.

3782
02:44:51,639 --> 02:44:54,360
Jack, what are you going to give Vinnie's house?

3783
02:44:55,559 --> 02:44:56,680
A, B, C, or D?

3784
02:44:57,239 --> 02:45:00,620
Because right now, Vinnie, you're looking at a-

3785
02:45:01,659 --> 02:45:03,500
Somewhere around a B, it seems like.

3786
02:45:03,500 --> 02:45:04,219
No, no, no.

3787
02:45:04,219 --> 02:45:04,860
Hang on.

3788
02:45:04,860 --> 02:45:06,299
Here, I was doing this earlier.

3789
02:45:06,299 --> 02:45:07,420
I'm going to play an A chord.

3790
02:45:07,979 --> 02:45:11,799
Oh, it's a little out of tune, but don't worry.

3791
02:45:11,799 --> 02:45:13,000
I promised you that was an A chord.

3792
02:45:13,639 --> 02:45:16,680
Wait, before you do this, go to your volume and turn the music volume down.

3793
02:45:17,979 --> 02:45:20,200
No, it's okay.

3794
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:22,840
Wait, if I say no to the host, does that minus points?

3795
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:23,719
No, no, you're good.

3796
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:25,000
You can disagree.

3797
02:45:27,799 --> 02:45:29,239
All right, what do we got for a chat grade?

3798
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:34,680
Ooh, they're being pretty nice to you.

3799
02:45:35,879 --> 02:45:36,520
Thank you, Chad.

3800
02:45:37,559 --> 02:45:38,520
That's really kind of you.

3801
02:45:40,559 --> 02:45:41,600
Listen, I'll take a B.

3802
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:42,719
That doesn't matter.

3803
02:45:42,719 --> 02:45:46,079
But I'm just happy that I have a house that has furniture in it

3804
02:45:46,079 --> 02:45:50,250
that isn't, you know, upside down.

3805
02:45:50,250 --> 02:45:52,889
Because listen, I wouldn't want to live like that, would you?

3806
02:45:52,889 --> 02:45:53,370
I don't know.

3807
02:45:54,489 --> 02:45:57,450
And I'm really happy that I can sit on my couch and chill

3808
02:45:57,450 --> 02:45:59,290
and watch a little tiny TV over there.

3809
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:00,809
And then if I need to go to the bathroom,

3810
02:46:01,129 --> 02:46:02,409
I got my iPad here.

3811
02:46:03,209 --> 02:46:05,690
And then I can also cook while I'm in the bathroom.

3812
02:46:05,690 --> 02:46:06,649
It's really, really nice.

3813
02:46:06,649 --> 02:46:07,610
Saves a lot of time.

3814
02:46:07,610 --> 02:46:09,370
The iPad gave you extra points, by the way.

3815
02:46:09,370 --> 02:46:09,930
Be curious.

3816
02:46:12,889 --> 02:46:14,090
All right, what do we got?

3817
02:46:14,090 --> 02:46:16,569
We are at, you are getting,

3818
02:46:17,450 --> 02:46:19,930
the vote is pretty much locked in at this point.

3819
02:46:19,930 --> 02:46:21,370
Although a lot of people want to give you an A,

3820
02:46:21,370 --> 02:46:23,930
but it seems like the class is going to give you a B.

3821
02:46:25,629 --> 02:46:28,729
So listen, it is a tough act to follow.

3822
02:46:28,729 --> 02:46:31,280
It's Alex, you did something amazing.

3823
02:46:31,280 --> 02:46:36,010
House, whether or not I, that's a tough act to follow.

3824
02:46:36,010 --> 02:46:40,139
Vinny, Vinny, I think you might be pleasantly surprised by this grade.

3825
02:46:42,909 --> 02:46:45,229
You got an 83.8.

3826
02:46:45,229 --> 02:46:48,840
I'll take it.

3827
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:50,280
You got a solid B.

3828
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:51,159
That's a solid B.

3829
02:46:51,879 --> 02:46:54,040
I'll take it.

3830
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:54,680
Very nice.

3831
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:55,239
Very clean.

3832
02:46:55,239 --> 02:46:56,120
I like the philosophy.

3833
02:46:56,760 --> 02:46:57,790
Thanks.

3834
02:46:57,790 --> 02:46:58,270
Excellent.

3835
02:46:58,270 --> 02:46:58,670
Excellent.

3836
02:46:58,670 --> 02:46:59,069
Excellent.

3837
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:01,799
If you could hit escape and go to your options

3838
02:47:01,799 --> 02:47:03,239
and turn the volume down on your music.

3839
02:47:03,959 --> 02:47:09,420
Turn down.

3840
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:10,540
Oh, there you go.

3841
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:11,260
All right.

3842
02:47:11,260 --> 02:47:13,420
Can we get, anybody have anything to say?

3843
02:47:14,139 --> 02:47:15,420
Yeah, I think you got robbed.

3844
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:16,860
I think that was easily an A house.

3845
02:47:18,399 --> 02:47:19,600
I agree.

3846
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:20,239
I loved it.

3847
02:47:20,239 --> 02:47:20,719
Thank you.

3848
02:47:20,719 --> 02:47:23,600
I quite appreciate the crime scene and all the blood on the walls.

3849
02:47:24,399 --> 02:47:24,879
Thank you.

3850
02:47:24,879 --> 02:47:27,600
Like, you know, it really adds something unexpected in your home.

3851
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,520
You know, Jeremy, if we have a private room, do you,

3852
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:32,000
is it really your right to barge in there and start looking around?

3853
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:34,159
Oh, shit.

3854
02:47:34,159 --> 02:47:35,360
That's a good point.

3855
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:35,680
Yeah.

3856
02:47:38,299 --> 02:47:39,899
If we have a private room.

3857
02:47:39,899 --> 02:47:40,540
I'm sorry, Vinny.

3858
02:47:41,579 --> 02:47:42,780
He didn't want that to be seen.

3859
02:47:43,420 --> 02:47:46,700
How come they didn't do like a New York City box apartment?

3860
02:47:47,899 --> 02:47:50,350
What was the maze, actually?

3861
02:47:50,350 --> 02:47:52,270
No, I'm sorry to say there is no maze.

3862
02:47:52,270 --> 02:47:53,229
I enjoyed your maze.

3863
02:47:53,229 --> 02:47:54,350
Yeah, no maze.

3864
02:47:54,350 --> 02:47:54,590
Yeah.

3865
02:47:56,750 --> 02:47:57,069
Yeah.

3866
02:47:57,069 --> 02:47:58,829
There was a maze category.

3867
02:47:59,870 --> 02:48:01,469
I also added an image of Japanese Google,

3868
02:48:01,469 --> 02:48:04,430
just in case you were confused in the chat.

3869
02:48:04,430 --> 02:48:05,229
You can see it.

3870
02:48:05,229 --> 02:48:07,840
Cool.

3871
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:08,000
All right.

3872
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:08,959
So we got, who's up next?

3873
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:10,079
Yeah.

3874
02:48:10,079 --> 02:48:10,639
Thanks, Vinny.

3875
02:48:10,639 --> 02:48:12,569
It was an awesome job.

3876
02:48:12,569 --> 02:48:12,969
Thanks for coming out.

3877
02:48:12,969 --> 02:48:13,770
I'm going to get going, too.

3878
02:48:13,770 --> 02:48:14,809
So have a good one, everybody.

3879
02:48:14,809 --> 02:48:15,209
Good luck.

3880
02:48:15,209 --> 02:48:15,610
Good luck.

3881
02:48:15,610 --> 02:48:15,930
Bye.

3882
02:48:15,930 --> 02:48:16,489
Thanks, Vinny.

3883
02:48:16,489 --> 02:48:17,610
Take care.

3884
02:48:17,610 --> 02:48:18,409
Later.

3885
02:48:18,409 --> 02:48:19,290
Vinny's a good lad.

3886
02:48:19,610 --> 02:48:20,250
All right.

3887
02:48:20,250 --> 02:48:21,049
Who's up next?

3888
02:48:21,049 --> 02:48:22,569
I think it's either Polk or Ludwig, right?

3889
02:48:22,569 --> 02:48:24,569
Who's, any of you two need to dip?

3890
02:48:24,569 --> 02:48:26,090
You want to get it over with or?

3891
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:28,920
I'm ready.

3892
02:48:29,559 --> 02:48:30,120
Oh, no, no.

3893
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:32,200
Yeah, Kraken, it is you because you do have to dip.

3894
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:33,079
Yeah, Kraken has to dip.

3895
02:48:33,079 --> 02:48:40,379
So why can I still hear this music?

3896
02:48:41,260 --> 02:48:44,079
Is this from my camera?

3897
02:48:47,559 --> 02:48:48,360
Oh, it's Vinny.

3898
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:49,719
Vinny's still live.

3899
02:48:49,719 --> 02:48:50,920
He's like still doing it.

3900
02:48:52,680 --> 02:48:55,079
So we're going to tell Vinny to, all right.

3901
02:48:55,079 --> 02:48:57,959
Let's tell Vinny that he has to stop screen sharing.

3902
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:03,159
Okay, there we go.

3903
02:49:03,719 --> 02:49:05,850
All right, Kraken, are you ready?

3904
02:49:05,850 --> 02:49:06,489
Yeah.

3905
02:49:06,489 --> 02:49:08,680
Let's just do a quick little move around test.

3906
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:13,610
I think it looks all right.

3907
02:49:13,610 --> 02:49:16,649
Okay, we are ready for Kraken's house.

3908
02:49:18,430 --> 02:49:20,040
Take it away, Kraken.

3909
02:49:20,040 --> 02:49:20,840
Welcome, everyone.

3910
02:49:21,479 --> 02:49:23,159
Yeah, this is my house.

3911
02:49:24,200 --> 02:49:26,360
Yeah, first time in this game.

3912
02:49:27,159 --> 02:49:29,079
So, you know, learned a lot on the fly.

3913
02:49:29,079 --> 02:49:30,600
And I know the first thing you're thinking is,

3914
02:49:31,159 --> 02:49:33,879
yeah, you know, compared to some of the other yards,

3915
02:49:33,879 --> 02:49:35,399
this seems like it's a little bit messy.

3916
02:49:35,399 --> 02:49:36,760
This is kind of dirty, Kraken.

3917
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:37,879
This is very dirty.

3918
02:49:39,579 --> 02:49:40,860
And you'd be right.

3919
02:49:40,860 --> 02:49:43,340
But also, what if I told you it was intentional

3920
02:49:43,340 --> 02:49:44,940
and that some of this trash was left here

3921
02:49:44,940 --> 02:49:47,579
with a very important message?

3922
02:49:48,379 --> 02:49:49,899
Okay, well, I'm going to have, honestly,

3923
02:49:49,899 --> 02:49:52,219
I'm going to have to start you out at like a 60 for cleanliness

3924
02:49:52,219 --> 02:49:53,739
just because of what we know so far,

3925
02:49:53,739 --> 02:49:55,639
but I'm willing to change it.

3926
02:49:55,639 --> 02:49:58,200
And that's all I'm looking to hear, all right?

3927
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:59,639
Just, you know, open mind.

3928
02:49:59,639 --> 02:50:04,489
And that's that what you see here, huh, a fallout shelter.

3929
02:50:05,290 --> 02:50:08,090
Are you saying that maybe something like

3930
02:50:08,889 --> 02:50:12,090
this world that we're in is kind of a post-apocalyptic one,

3931
02:50:12,090 --> 02:50:16,329
per chance, and maybe there is like some mess out here

3932
02:50:16,329 --> 02:50:19,690
left from, you know, the fucking fall of humanity?

3933
02:50:20,250 --> 02:50:20,729
Okay.

3934
02:50:20,729 --> 02:50:22,090
Have you thought about that?

3935
02:50:22,090 --> 02:50:23,370
I have thought about it.

3936
02:50:23,370 --> 02:50:25,209
I'm also thinking about potentially you

3937
02:50:25,209 --> 02:50:26,729
forgetting how much time is left and just going,

3938
02:50:26,729 --> 02:50:27,850
oh, shit, there's a lot of trash outside.

3939
02:50:27,850 --> 02:50:30,559
I have to pretend I have to come up with a story.

3940
02:50:30,559 --> 02:50:33,040
Or maybe this was the point all along.

3941
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:34,959
And let me welcome you inside too.

3942
02:50:36,319 --> 02:50:38,719
Are you familiar, by the way, with the whole,

3943
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:40,399
you know, Barbie movie, Oppenheimer,

3944
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,360
kind of, you know, double feature thing

3945
02:50:43,360 --> 02:50:45,040
that's been going on the internet, very topical.

3946
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:47,450
Everyone's all looking forward to it.

3947
02:50:47,450 --> 02:50:50,329
I know that the Barbie movie is coming out.

3948
02:50:50,329 --> 02:50:54,489
And the Oppenheimer movie is coming out the same day.

3949
02:50:54,489 --> 02:50:55,610
Oh, it's coming out the same day.

3950
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:55,930
All right.

3951
02:50:55,930 --> 02:50:56,489
Okay, I get it.

3952
02:50:56,489 --> 02:50:56,809
I get it.

3953
02:50:56,809 --> 02:50:57,129
I get it.

3954
02:50:57,129 --> 02:50:57,770
That's the whole thing.

3955
02:50:58,729 --> 02:51:02,569
So I thought, what if we made a fallout shelter, right?

3956
02:51:02,569 --> 02:51:06,409
Because Oppenheimer, that was themed after Barbie.

3957
02:51:08,239 --> 02:51:09,680
Oh, okay.

3958
02:51:10,399 --> 02:51:11,040
Yeah, let it come.

3959
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:11,840
All right.

3960
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:13,040
We're still percolating here.

3961
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:14,000
So welcome on in.

3962
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,600
This is the first room we have.

3963
02:51:16,239 --> 02:51:20,799
And you'll see that there's each room in this house is themed

3964
02:51:21,530 --> 02:51:25,930
after a different, just kind of fun concept, right?

3965
02:51:25,930 --> 02:51:28,809
Something that I think Barbie would enjoy

3966
02:51:28,809 --> 02:51:31,549
or you'd want in a fallout shelter

3967
02:51:31,549 --> 02:51:37,020
should the Oppenheimer bombs fall, you know, at any minute.

3968
02:51:37,020 --> 02:51:38,299
So this is the first one.

3969
02:51:38,299 --> 02:51:39,180
Any questions?

3970
02:51:39,180 --> 02:51:40,059
Feel free to ask.

3971
02:51:40,059 --> 02:51:41,100
I have one question.

3972
02:51:41,100 --> 02:51:43,420
And it is, did you and Vinnie use the same wallpaper?

3973
02:51:46,329 --> 02:51:48,010
I don't think he used this one, did he?

3974
02:51:48,010 --> 02:51:52,569
I will say there's a good chance this wallpaper.

3975
02:51:52,569 --> 02:51:52,969
Yes.

3976
02:51:52,969 --> 02:51:54,170
No, we did use the same.

3977
02:51:54,170 --> 02:51:56,649
You'll notice there's more than one wallpaper in this house.

3978
02:51:56,649 --> 02:52:00,729
And that's because, like I mentioned, each is a different theme.

3979
02:52:00,729 --> 02:52:02,809
And so this is the neon room.

3980
02:52:02,809 --> 02:52:03,309
Okay.

3981
02:52:03,850 --> 02:52:07,129
We have a little TV here, like, you know, TV Mike from Willy Wonka.

3982
02:52:07,129 --> 02:52:07,610
What happened here?

3983
02:52:07,610 --> 02:52:08,809
And hop over this.

3984
02:52:08,809 --> 02:52:09,290
What happened here?

3985
02:52:09,290 --> 02:52:10,889
Well, this is the fish room, as you can see.

3986
02:52:12,379 --> 02:52:15,020
So we have a little fish here in the corner.

3987
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:17,200
And that's it.

3988
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:19,120
Now we can move on to this is the love room.

3989
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:20,639
This is the love room.

3990
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:21,600
Yes.

3991
02:52:22,159 --> 02:52:22,399
Yeah.

3992
02:52:22,959 --> 02:52:23,920
We got fairy lights.

3993
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:26,639
We got some chocolate and...

3994
02:52:26,639 --> 02:52:28,879
Is there a reason why the chocolate and the lights

3995
02:52:28,879 --> 02:52:34,840
are not on a structure of any kind?

3996
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:36,680
Like on a table?

3997
02:52:36,680 --> 02:52:37,159
Yeah.

3998
02:52:37,159 --> 02:52:38,600
We only had one of those nets for the fish.

3999
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:39,100
Okay.

4000
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:45,000
Turns out it takes a lot of time to keep adding, you know,

4001
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:45,959
furniture.

4002
02:52:45,959 --> 02:52:52,200
And it's better to focus, in my mind, on the philosophy and the spirit of a room

4003
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:55,879
than on the actual, you know, amenities.

4004
02:52:55,879 --> 02:52:57,879
So I can do something real quick for me right now.

4005
02:52:57,879 --> 02:52:59,079
Just very quickly.

4006
02:52:59,079 --> 02:52:59,319
Yeah.

4007
02:52:59,319 --> 02:53:09,389
Take out your mop and mop the floor for a second.

4008
02:53:09,389 --> 02:53:10,590
That's the floor, baby.

4009
02:53:10,590 --> 02:53:12,430
That's just what it looks like, guys.

4010
02:53:12,430 --> 02:53:12,750
Yeah.

4011
02:53:12,750 --> 02:53:14,989
This was by design.

4012
02:53:17,479 --> 02:53:21,319
I appreciate you checking, though, that my lovely floor was not dirty.

4013
02:53:22,120 --> 02:53:22,440
Okay.

4014
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:24,280
Definitely didn't hurt.

4015
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:24,680
Okay.

4016
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:27,239
Well, speaking of amenities, this is the snow room.

4017
02:53:28,190 --> 02:53:32,110
We have a friend and snow is cold.

4018
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:36,600
So we have a, you know, a fridge, which is also used in fallout shelters

4019
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:38,600
to escape bombs like in Indiana Jones.

4020
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:40,280
So I love it.

4021
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:41,920
I love the snow room.

4022
02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:42,639
Great.

4023
02:53:42,639 --> 02:53:46,319
Moving on, we have this is the neon room.

4024
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:52,159
And over here in the corner, we have my little rat friends.

4025
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:57,680
They have their water bowl and a nice little bed.

4026
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:59,680
Of course, we keep our cool.

4027
02:53:59,680 --> 02:54:01,920
We don't want them to get out and make a mess.

4028
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:03,440
So we take them out one at a time.

4029
02:54:03,440 --> 02:54:05,200
Something happened with the wallpaper back there.

4030
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:06,799
There's some wallpaper issues I see.

4031
02:54:06,799 --> 02:54:10,110
There's also some structural complexity issues.

4032
02:54:10,110 --> 02:54:14,590
I think that are maybe bringing a little bit of the points down.

4033
02:54:16,059 --> 02:54:18,680
Go back in this room and look to the right.

4034
02:54:18,680 --> 02:54:19,399
Oh, you mean?

4035
02:54:19,399 --> 02:54:24,379
Yeah, I'm seeing a little bit of snow tends to blow, right?

4036
02:54:24,459 --> 02:54:26,540
And so I just thought it'd be kind of fun to show

4037
02:54:26,540 --> 02:54:29,500
that it gets around the house sometimes, you know, in the right mood.

4038
02:54:30,139 --> 02:54:34,540
Speaking of, look, we can fill the rat's cage with food.

4039
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:35,739
That's a cute thing, right?

4040
02:54:35,739 --> 02:54:36,459
Look at that.

4041
02:54:36,459 --> 02:54:41,100
Honestly, first person to incorporate an animal like an animal enclosure.

4042
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:42,059
We've seen a couple of rats,

4043
02:54:42,059 --> 02:54:44,299
but we have not seen an actual animal enclosure yet.

4044
02:54:44,299 --> 02:54:46,139
So I'm going to have to give you some points.

4045
02:54:46,139 --> 02:54:47,760
They have comfortable space.

4046
02:54:49,399 --> 02:54:54,040
Moving on, we have now we're entering the dog room.

4047
02:54:55,690 --> 02:54:56,569
Good dog.

4048
02:54:56,569 --> 02:54:57,610
Can I stop here for one second?

4049
02:54:58,489 --> 02:55:00,649
You started this with a philosophy of 95

4050
02:55:00,649 --> 02:55:05,129
because you told me at the entrance that this was a Barbie Oppenheimer house.

4051
02:55:05,129 --> 02:55:07,979
Did that change in your process?

4052
02:55:07,979 --> 02:55:09,180
Give me your philosophy on this.

4053
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:11,979
Did that change halfway through?

4054
02:55:11,979 --> 02:55:13,340
May I counter you with this?

4055
02:55:13,340 --> 02:55:14,780
Does Barbie not have a dog?

4056
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:16,250
I don't know.

4057
02:55:16,250 --> 02:55:17,290
Does Barbie have a dog?

4058
02:55:17,290 --> 02:55:19,739
I don't know either, but probably, right?

4059
02:55:19,739 --> 02:55:21,899
So this is the good dog room.

4060
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:24,459
I was thinking of all the fun things

4061
02:55:24,459 --> 02:55:27,979
that Barbie would like to have in her playhouse, you know?

4062
02:55:28,219 --> 02:55:30,940
And so I couldn't find many props related to dogs.

4063
02:55:30,940 --> 02:55:33,020
So I do have a nice dog light down here,

4064
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:35,020
but that's all we got.

4065
02:55:35,020 --> 02:55:39,260
So over here, every good house needs a toilet.

4066
02:55:40,780 --> 02:55:44,040
This is an outhouse that you put behind this?

4067
02:55:44,040 --> 02:55:44,280
Yeah.

4068
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:46,520
Well, we didn't have plumbing working,

4069
02:55:47,079 --> 02:55:49,639
so I did have to just kind of drill a hole in the wall

4070
02:55:49,639 --> 02:55:50,600
and throw the outhouse outside.

4071
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:52,440
We also have the piss buckets for the overflow.

4072
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:53,959
Oh, those are pee?

4073
02:55:53,959 --> 02:55:55,639
You're not getting higher than a 60 in cleanliness.

4074
02:55:55,639 --> 02:55:56,280
This is not happening.

4075
02:55:56,280 --> 02:55:56,920
I'm sorry, Kraken.

4076
02:55:56,920 --> 02:55:58,040
We have buckets for them.

4077
02:55:58,040 --> 02:55:59,639
They're not on the ground.

4078
02:55:59,639 --> 02:56:01,719
I can show you the broom thing again if you want to confirm,

4079
02:56:01,719 --> 02:56:02,840
but they aren't, you know.

4080
02:56:03,399 --> 02:56:05,479
I'm going to give you some points in creativity

4081
02:56:05,479 --> 02:56:07,319
because that's actually funny,

4082
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:10,680
but you're not getting higher than a 60 in cleanliness.

4083
02:56:10,680 --> 02:56:11,719
It's just impossible.

4084
02:56:11,719 --> 02:56:13,239
Just wait till you see the rest of the place,

4085
02:56:13,239 --> 02:56:15,399
and I think maybe you'll be changing your tune.

4086
02:56:15,399 --> 02:56:15,879
Okay.

4087
02:56:15,879 --> 02:56:17,639
Speaking of cleanliness, this is the plant room.

4088
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:20,510
I know you said that you were excited

4089
02:56:20,510 --> 02:56:23,389
that there was a garden from one of the earlier contestants,

4090
02:56:23,389 --> 02:56:26,590
and I thought, what about if the garden was inside?

4091
02:56:26,590 --> 02:56:29,870
And also, in case the zombies come,

4092
02:56:30,190 --> 02:56:31,950
this is, again, a fallout shelter at the end of the day,

4093
02:56:31,950 --> 02:56:37,069
and so we have an ammo box and machine gun just for guarding the place.

4094
02:56:37,069 --> 02:56:41,389
You know what I think would really help stop an intrusion by zombies?

4095
02:56:41,389 --> 02:56:43,069
It's having full walls.

4096
02:56:43,069 --> 02:56:44,670
I think that would help

4097
02:56:45,709 --> 02:56:47,709
with maybe a weapon aiming from a different floor.

4098
02:56:49,629 --> 02:56:51,950
So I'm going to have to give you a little bit of a doc on that.

4099
02:56:51,950 --> 02:56:54,250
Now, what if I threw this out there?

4100
02:56:54,250 --> 02:56:56,379
Plants versus zombies.

4101
02:57:01,959 --> 02:57:03,479
I gave you a point in philosophy for that.

4102
02:57:03,479 --> 02:57:04,440
All right, great.

4103
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:06,840
Moving on, this is the Mexico room.

4104
02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:15,340
We have kind of the Day of the Dead theme with this garland and little skull,

4105
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:18,860
and then over here, a full-on spooky guy.

4106
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:24,299
I just really want to make sure that each room here felt like its own world.

4107
02:57:24,299 --> 02:57:27,979
Its own world, just like the Barbie in the Oppenheimer movie.

4108
02:57:28,700 --> 02:57:30,379
Now you can see my vision.

4109
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:34,799
Then I got back on track with the theme of the Oppenheimer thing

4110
02:57:34,799 --> 02:57:39,850
with like a kind of a like a generator, gas generator, right?

4111
02:57:40,649 --> 02:57:43,049
Some boots, which you would probably need in the wasteland.

4112
02:57:43,870 --> 02:57:47,870
Moving on, we have a cute cat portrait that I found on the shop

4113
02:57:47,870 --> 02:57:51,549
and just couldn't help but put in the very cute in my building.

4114
02:57:51,549 --> 02:57:53,690
Yeah, it's very cute.

4115
02:57:53,690 --> 02:57:54,969
This is the brooding corner.

4116
02:57:55,930 --> 02:57:58,010
I was really with the guns.

4117
02:57:58,010 --> 02:58:00,760
Everybody has like a gun with a chair.

4118
02:58:00,760 --> 02:58:05,639
Well, you would you naturally hang your gun up when you, you know,

4119
02:58:05,639 --> 02:58:10,059
are like kicking back and just reminds you of your own mortality like Oppenheimer does.

4120
02:58:10,860 --> 02:58:12,780
That movie I believe is going to be a bit dark.

4121
02:58:12,780 --> 02:58:14,379
So I thought a nice little brooding corner would be good.

4122
02:58:14,379 --> 02:58:16,620
This little spider over there though to keep it keep it light.

4123
02:58:17,639 --> 02:58:20,760
And then this of course is bringing us to the end of the tour,

4124
02:58:22,040 --> 02:58:24,600
which by the way, I don't know if you noticed this was a maze the whole time.

4125
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:25,959
I was gonna say, where are the doors?

4126
02:58:26,520 --> 02:58:30,170
Somebody said, does Barbie not have doors?

4127
02:58:30,170 --> 02:58:38,280
The doors were made because as I mentioned, someone, me,

4128
02:58:39,079 --> 02:58:42,120
this is their first experience with this game and first built the walls.

4129
02:58:42,120 --> 02:58:45,399
And then later didn't realize the doors were a thing until after,

4130
02:58:46,600 --> 02:58:48,200
you know, using the sledgehammer tool.

4131
02:58:48,200 --> 02:58:52,680
But I think it adds to kind of the rustic feel of, you know,

4132
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:54,040
finding your way through a maze, right?

4133
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:58,200
You sort of did the reverse of, oh my God, mom and dad are coming home.

4134
02:58:58,200 --> 02:58:59,959
We have to clean up the place.

4135
02:58:59,959 --> 02:59:03,000
So you kind of did like, oh my God, mom and dad are coming home.

4136
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,610
We have to build a fucking house.

4137
02:59:05,610 --> 02:59:05,770
Yeah.

4138
02:59:05,770 --> 02:59:08,170
And that's how this is what you could come up with.

4139
02:59:08,170 --> 02:59:09,850
That's kind of that's pretty accurate.

4140
02:59:10,250 --> 02:59:13,129
I also think though, there's some cool parallel, you know,

4141
02:59:13,129 --> 02:59:14,409
comparison of the rats, right?

4142
02:59:14,409 --> 02:59:15,610
Rats in a maze.

4143
02:59:15,610 --> 02:59:17,209
And then here we are in a maze.

4144
02:59:18,139 --> 02:59:20,219
And so that's probably worth a couple of points.

4145
02:59:20,219 --> 02:59:23,659
You know, is this 90s themed?

4146
02:59:23,659 --> 02:59:24,780
Is this 90s themed?

4147
02:59:24,780 --> 02:59:25,739
Is this 90s themed?

4148
02:59:28,700 --> 02:59:30,569
This room, yes.

4149
02:59:32,079 --> 02:59:33,600
This room, yes.

4150
02:59:34,239 --> 02:59:35,950
This room, yes.

4151
02:59:37,549 --> 02:59:39,549
This room is kind of timeless, I think, though.

4152
02:59:39,549 --> 02:59:41,389
So, you know, take that as you will.

4153
02:59:41,389 --> 02:59:41,870
All right.

4154
02:59:41,870 --> 02:59:44,590
Finally, though, we got to go to the we got to go to the upstairs.

4155
02:59:44,590 --> 02:59:47,000
See, because I want to see upstairs.

4156
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:51,760
Well, feast your eyes on the point of this whole maze.

4157
02:59:54,680 --> 02:59:55,959
All about good vibes over here.

4158
02:59:55,959 --> 02:59:59,879
And so what is better than good vibes, especially at the end of the world,

4159
02:59:59,879 --> 03:00:01,559
at the the apocalypse of time?

4160
03:00:02,760 --> 03:00:05,639
We know toilet paper is going to be the most valuable thing.

4161
03:00:05,639 --> 03:00:12,200
So I just wanted to kind of pay homage to that and have kind of a nice,

4162
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:14,520
you know, denouement, if you will,

4163
03:00:14,520 --> 03:00:16,840
kind of wrapping everything up here as you come to the top.

4164
03:00:16,840 --> 03:00:19,479
You did get a point in cleanliness because of the toilet paper there.

4165
03:00:19,479 --> 03:00:20,760
So there's one point in cleanliness.

4166
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:22,590
You got a 61, a 61.

4167
03:00:22,590 --> 03:00:22,909
Great.

4168
03:00:22,909 --> 03:00:23,950
Well, I'll take that.

4169
03:00:25,709 --> 03:00:26,030
All right.

4170
03:00:27,790 --> 03:00:28,989
Can you look at the ceiling?

4171
03:00:28,989 --> 03:00:30,879
OK.

4172
03:00:30,879 --> 03:00:31,600
Look down.

4173
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:33,799
OK.

4174
03:00:33,799 --> 03:00:35,319
I just was seeing what was on the ground.

4175
03:00:35,319 --> 03:00:40,239
If you had anything, was this default, the default floor on the ground?

4176
03:00:40,239 --> 03:00:43,770
Well, I think since I went through a lot of effort

4177
03:00:44,409 --> 03:00:46,729
putting up wallpaper on literally every other wall,

4178
03:00:47,450 --> 03:00:50,090
I really I kind of thought the ending being a more

4179
03:00:50,969 --> 03:00:54,909
minimal kind of, you know, good vibe room.

4180
03:00:54,909 --> 03:00:55,229
OK.

4181
03:00:55,950 --> 03:00:58,670
Would just would just kind of tie the whole thing together and

4182
03:00:59,950 --> 03:01:01,229
you know, I didn't want to overdo it.

4183
03:01:01,229 --> 03:01:01,870
Can we get chat?

4184
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:03,229
Can we get chat to give a grade of this house?

4185
03:01:03,229 --> 03:01:04,190
What do you guys think?

4186
03:01:04,190 --> 03:01:05,469
A, B, C, D.

4187
03:01:05,469 --> 03:01:06,750
We don't give F's here.

4188
03:01:06,750 --> 03:01:10,780
All right, Kraken, I can tell you what I got over here so far.

4189
03:01:10,780 --> 03:01:11,899
I got you at an 80.

4190
03:01:11,899 --> 03:01:14,540
I got you an 85 for creativity because you really pulled me in

4191
03:01:14,540 --> 03:01:16,219
with the whole Oppenheimer Barbie house.

4192
03:01:16,860 --> 03:01:17,340
Yeah.

4193
03:01:17,340 --> 03:01:20,379
And I dropped some scores elsewhere because it turned out

4194
03:01:20,379 --> 03:01:21,979
that that was just a bait and switch.

4195
03:01:21,979 --> 03:01:24,219
And you you grabbed us.

4196
03:01:24,219 --> 03:01:28,040
And unfortunately, if your whole house had been a Barbie house,

4197
03:01:28,040 --> 03:01:29,739
it probably would have been a lot higher.

4198
03:01:29,739 --> 03:01:31,420
I just I'm just going to be completely honest with you.

4199
03:01:31,420 --> 03:01:35,659
Although the philosophy of you making individual rooms

4200
03:01:35,659 --> 03:01:38,780
and individual spaces that were completely disconnected

4201
03:01:38,780 --> 03:01:41,120
from each other did have to take you some time.

4202
03:01:41,120 --> 03:01:42,719
And you stuck with that philosophy.

4203
03:01:42,719 --> 03:01:45,879
So I'm going to you got an 87 for philosophy.

4204
03:01:45,879 --> 03:01:46,200
Wow.

4205
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:47,079
Thank you.

4206
03:01:47,079 --> 03:01:51,000
You got 76 for complexity and 61 for cleanliness.

4207
03:01:51,079 --> 03:01:55,239
Chat has given you they're still deciding,

4208
03:01:55,239 --> 03:01:56,920
but it looks like they're going to give you a C.

4209
03:01:56,920 --> 03:01:59,280
Oh, all right.

4210
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:01,100
Well, question.

4211
03:02:01,100 --> 03:02:02,860
Where is the rest of the upstairs?

4212
03:02:02,860 --> 03:02:04,860
Oh, wait, wait.

4213
03:02:04,860 --> 03:02:05,100
Yeah.

4214
03:02:05,100 --> 03:02:07,530
Where is the rest of the upstairs?

4215
03:02:07,530 --> 03:02:16,120
So rather than leaving a empty room that kind of felt unfinished,

4216
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:21,600
I opted for let's just kind of box it in.

4217
03:02:22,239 --> 03:02:23,520
What does the outside look like?

4218
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:26,239
Can you go out to the outside and look at the exterior?

4219
03:02:31,639 --> 03:02:34,239
Chat, you got 75 from chat.

4220
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:35,280
Your total grade.

4221
03:02:38,379 --> 03:02:41,280
Actually, all right.

4222
03:02:43,319 --> 03:02:44,680
You got a 78.4.

4223
03:02:44,680 --> 03:02:46,350
That's a C plus.

4224
03:02:46,350 --> 03:02:48,030
Hey, almost a B.

4225
03:02:48,969 --> 03:02:49,450
All right.

4226
03:02:49,450 --> 03:02:50,090
I'll take it.

4227
03:02:50,649 --> 03:02:57,069
I will say you hit the nail on the head with the Oppenheimer Barbie house

4228
03:02:58,909 --> 03:03:01,870
kind of being abandoned halfway through for the multiple room thing.

4229
03:03:01,870 --> 03:03:02,909
That's exactly what happened.

4230
03:03:02,909 --> 03:03:03,549
That's what I figured.

4231
03:03:04,030 --> 03:03:06,909
I started with that vision and I thought, oh, this is going to be great.

4232
03:03:06,909 --> 03:03:10,430
And then kind of got carried away, I believe, with each of these rooms.

4233
03:03:10,430 --> 03:03:12,750
So, you know, you hit the nail on the head there.

4234
03:03:12,750 --> 03:03:14,430
And I think if I could go back, I would have just done.

4235
03:03:14,430 --> 03:03:16,270
Hey, honestly, your first thing.

4236
03:03:16,270 --> 03:03:18,829
Philosophy, you beat at an 87 for philosophy.

4237
03:03:19,870 --> 03:03:20,750
You were on the right track.

4238
03:03:20,750 --> 03:03:23,149
It's just timing and first time playing it.

4239
03:03:23,149 --> 03:03:24,270
I completely get it.

4240
03:03:24,270 --> 03:03:25,069
That's a good job.

4241
03:03:25,069 --> 03:03:26,750
It was very wonderful presentation.

4242
03:03:26,750 --> 03:03:27,870
Very wonderful house.

4243
03:03:27,870 --> 03:03:30,489
Everybody should be clapping right now, please.

4244
03:03:30,489 --> 03:03:32,159
Thank you, Kraikin.

4245
03:03:32,159 --> 03:03:32,959
Thank you.

4246
03:03:32,959 --> 03:03:34,829
Yeah, this has been a pleasure.

4247
03:03:34,829 --> 03:03:36,590
Anybody have anything to say about Kraikin's

4248
03:03:37,549 --> 03:03:42,680
a themed house that became unthemed after 20 minutes?

4249
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:43,479
Yeah, I got a lot to say.

4250
03:03:44,670 --> 03:03:46,280
A lot to say.

4251
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:47,159
You got a lot to say.

4252
03:03:47,959 --> 03:03:51,389
First of all, fantastic job on the Maze and Corporation.

4253
03:03:51,389 --> 03:03:52,190
Thank you.

4254
03:03:52,190 --> 03:03:52,350
Really.

4255
03:03:52,350 --> 03:03:52,989
Thank you, founder.

4256
03:03:56,139 --> 03:04:00,940
Why, when you knocked down the wall, Jerma said, whoa, at an empty room.

4257
03:04:00,940 --> 03:04:02,219
I just, what the fuck was that?

4258
03:04:03,360 --> 03:04:05,280
We just said, whoa, at an empty room.

4259
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:07,200
What was that?

4260
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:10,079
Well, I, because I didn't know the empty room.

4261
03:04:10,079 --> 03:04:13,040
It was very strange that he was able to hide this from me so well.

4262
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:17,360
Actually, it's kind of strange that he built a wall.

4263
03:04:17,360 --> 03:04:18,559
Oh, we got maze drama.

4264
03:04:18,559 --> 03:04:19,360
He hid it from me.

4265
03:04:19,360 --> 03:04:20,079
He hid it from me.

4266
03:04:20,079 --> 03:04:21,120
All the mazes.

4267
03:04:21,120 --> 03:04:22,799
You two both made mazes.

4268
03:04:22,799 --> 03:04:24,159
You guys both made mazes.

4269
03:04:25,360 --> 03:04:26,639
Look, it was not empty.

4270
03:04:26,639 --> 03:04:30,239
There actually was another toilet paper behind the wall in case you lose the first one.

4271
03:04:30,239 --> 03:04:30,799
There's a second one.

4272
03:04:30,799 --> 03:04:32,159
I just saw it in my comments.

4273
03:04:32,159 --> 03:04:33,120
I apologize then.

4274
03:04:33,120 --> 03:04:34,479
Additional toilet paper.

4275
03:04:34,479 --> 03:04:36,440
Yeah, there's an Easter egg.

4276
03:04:37,709 --> 03:04:39,389
Your outside is very dirty.

4277
03:04:39,389 --> 03:04:40,909
Your outside is very dirty.

4278
03:04:42,030 --> 03:04:45,469
Out of everybody, I know it's part of the theme, but you have the worst outside, I would say.

4279
03:04:45,469 --> 03:04:48,110
And I mean that in the nicest way possible.

4280
03:04:48,110 --> 03:04:48,989
Open the garage, please.

4281
03:04:49,549 --> 03:04:50,829
There's no nice way to say that.

4282
03:04:50,829 --> 03:04:52,590
I did clean this side, though.

4283
03:04:52,590 --> 03:04:54,600
Look, Vinny, okay?

4284
03:04:54,600 --> 03:04:57,819
Oh shit, you did clean that side.

4285
03:04:57,819 --> 03:05:00,860
I don't know why I cleaned that corner, but I did.

4286
03:05:00,860 --> 03:05:01,899
What's in the garage?

4287
03:05:01,899 --> 03:05:04,299
It was a very enticing corner to clean, I agree.

4288
03:05:04,299 --> 03:05:06,059
I will, Joel.

4289
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:10,860
Joel is the only one really that actually utilized the garage.

4290
03:05:10,860 --> 03:05:11,500
That's true.

4291
03:05:11,500 --> 03:05:12,860
This is true.

4292
03:05:12,860 --> 03:05:18,139
Joel is sitting at an 87 right now.

4293
03:05:18,139 --> 03:05:19,500
All right, are we ready to move on?

4294
03:05:21,500 --> 03:05:22,860
Now it's either Polk or Ludwig.

4295
03:05:22,860 --> 03:05:23,420
I think it's...

4296
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:25,899
Who do we got?

4297
03:05:25,899 --> 03:05:26,700
I'm ready.

4298
03:05:26,700 --> 03:05:28,059
Polk is ready to go right now.

4299
03:05:28,059 --> 03:05:32,090
And Ludwig will be right after Polk.

4300
03:05:32,090 --> 03:05:32,809
Polk, how are you?

4301
03:05:33,799 --> 03:05:34,120
Great.

4302
03:05:35,870 --> 03:05:36,590
How are you?

4303
03:05:36,590 --> 03:05:37,549
I'm doing fantastic.

4304
03:05:37,549 --> 03:05:38,750
I'm so glad you're actually here.

4305
03:05:39,549 --> 03:05:41,629
I'm so looking forward to your house.

4306
03:05:41,629 --> 03:05:44,270
I'm really happy you actually got to be here for this.

4307
03:05:45,229 --> 03:05:48,139
No, I really thought it was tomorrow.

4308
03:05:48,139 --> 03:05:49,340
But no, this is great.

4309
03:05:49,340 --> 03:05:51,260
Dates, times, it's hard.

4310
03:05:51,260 --> 03:05:53,100
It's easy to get it all messed up, right?

4311
03:05:55,069 --> 03:05:55,870
I checked the time.

4312
03:05:55,870 --> 03:05:56,909
I didn't go over.

4313
03:05:56,909 --> 03:05:58,829
I think I didn't cheat, so we're good.

4314
03:05:59,950 --> 03:06:01,790
We gave you time anyways, because make it fair.

4315
03:06:01,790 --> 03:06:02,670
Yeah, I cheated a little bit.

4316
03:06:04,299 --> 03:06:06,620
Well, Italic flipped his whole house upside down, so it's okay.

4317
03:06:07,959 --> 03:06:09,000
Let's open up your stream.

4318
03:06:10,120 --> 03:06:12,120
Can you just move it around for a little bit so I can see?

4319
03:06:12,120 --> 03:06:17,930
It's a little bit ready to turn around.

4320
03:06:17,930 --> 03:06:21,639
I think it's okay.

4321
03:06:21,639 --> 03:06:22,360
I think it's all right.

4322
03:06:22,360 --> 03:06:23,159
It should be good.

4323
03:06:23,159 --> 03:06:24,280
Let's just double check it.

4324
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:25,079
How do you guys feel?

4325
03:06:25,079 --> 03:06:26,520
Can you give us a full circle?

4326
03:06:30,459 --> 03:06:30,940
Yeah, we're good.

4327
03:06:30,940 --> 03:06:31,420
Looks good.

4328
03:06:32,379 --> 03:06:35,469
All right, Poke, take it away.

4329
03:06:35,469 --> 03:06:37,389
What do you got?

4330
03:06:37,389 --> 03:06:39,690
Hi, and welcome to my house.

4331
03:06:39,690 --> 03:06:45,819
I opened my door.

4332
03:06:45,819 --> 03:06:47,420
This is my beautiful house I worked on.

4333
03:06:50,540 --> 03:06:51,899
This is my first time playing, too.

4334
03:06:53,340 --> 03:06:54,620
I had no past experience.

4335
03:06:55,340 --> 03:06:57,500
On the way here, I woke up my roommate.

4336
03:06:57,500 --> 03:07:01,520
He won on my PC, did everything for me, the tutorial, everything.

4337
03:07:01,520 --> 03:07:05,159
And I just took over, and here's what I got.

4338
03:07:09,530 --> 03:07:11,049
Let's take a look at the outside.

4339
03:07:11,049 --> 03:07:14,010
The outside is a little dirty, Poke.

4340
03:07:14,010 --> 03:07:15,770
It's a little dirty on the outside.

4341
03:07:15,770 --> 03:07:18,090
I didn't really have time to clean the outside.

4342
03:07:20,569 --> 03:07:23,049
It's not about what is out anyways.

4343
03:07:23,049 --> 03:07:25,100
It's about what is inside.

4344
03:07:25,100 --> 03:07:25,979
I think that matters.

4345
03:07:27,340 --> 03:07:28,379
Can we start with the garage?

4346
03:07:30,219 --> 03:07:31,180
Do we have to?

4347
03:07:31,180 --> 03:07:33,100
Kind of, because I want to see if there's anything in it.

4348
03:07:33,100 --> 03:07:42,159
Do you hear the sound, by the way?

4349
03:07:42,959 --> 03:07:44,639
I hear the sound, yeah.

4350
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:48,079
All right, so cars can fit in here.

4351
03:07:49,799 --> 03:07:50,920
I mean, it's good.

4352
03:07:50,920 --> 03:07:51,399
It's clean.

4353
03:07:51,399 --> 03:07:54,190
You can fit cars if you really wanted to, you know?

4354
03:07:56,600 --> 03:08:03,440
So I went for like a lime green design, you know?

4355
03:08:04,079 --> 03:08:08,959
And if people look at, I mean, since the house isn't really done fully, you know,

4356
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:11,680
what's wrong with having a few placeholders, you know?

4357
03:08:13,530 --> 03:08:14,409
Are these other houses?

4358
03:08:14,409 --> 03:08:16,569
Is this what the house could look like eventually?

4359
03:08:16,569 --> 03:08:17,850
Is what's on the exterior?

4360
03:08:17,850 --> 03:08:20,250
I don't know.

4361
03:08:20,250 --> 03:08:23,040
I mean, those houses look great.

4362
03:08:23,040 --> 03:08:26,559
Whatever houses these are, they look phenomenal.

4363
03:08:26,559 --> 03:08:30,569
I mean, it just messes with your imagination a little bit.

4364
03:08:30,569 --> 03:08:31,850
It's like an optical illusion.

4365
03:08:33,049 --> 03:08:35,450
So here's, let's just go in the front.

4366
03:08:35,450 --> 03:08:36,969
This is the front of the house right here.

4367
03:08:36,969 --> 03:08:38,090
Wait, this is the front door?

4368
03:08:39,260 --> 03:08:39,760
Yep.

4369
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:42,959
You know, let's put some music on.

4370
03:08:48,170 --> 03:08:55,559
So I went with like a, I went with like a, like a airport, you know what I'm saying?

4371
03:08:55,559 --> 03:08:57,559
All right, so you made an airport in, okay.

4372
03:08:57,559 --> 03:08:58,920
Give me the philosophy on that.

4373
03:08:58,920 --> 03:09:02,520
I mean, when you're rich, you can really do anything you really want.

4374
03:09:02,520 --> 03:09:07,719
And this is for the people out there who just want to get what they want, you know?

4375
03:09:07,719 --> 03:09:10,219
And some people want a Willy Wonka house.

4376
03:09:10,219 --> 03:09:12,430
Some people want a fact, you know?

4377
03:09:12,430 --> 03:09:14,889
Some people really just want an airport.

4378
03:09:15,530 --> 03:09:16,569
I would want an airport.

4379
03:09:16,569 --> 03:09:18,010
Oh, can you elbow the city player?

4380
03:09:18,010 --> 03:09:19,850
I think there's something wrong with it.

4381
03:09:19,850 --> 03:09:26,040
I think it's skipping a little, okay?

4382
03:09:26,040 --> 03:09:30,329
Now, this is, we're all streamers here.

4383
03:09:30,329 --> 03:09:32,059
We're all streamers here.

4384
03:09:32,139 --> 03:09:38,780
And I made sure to make one of the houses really relatable to all of them.

4385
03:09:38,780 --> 03:09:40,219
This is the streamer room.

4386
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:43,659
Now, I didn't have any photos on my PC.

4387
03:09:43,659 --> 03:09:45,420
I only had sponsor photos.

4388
03:09:45,420 --> 03:09:50,430
So these are just, these are the different sponsors you've had throughout the last year?

4389
03:09:54,430 --> 03:09:57,549
You have one of those banned lawn chairs.

4390
03:09:57,549 --> 03:10:02,879
The most uncomfortable, those things make sweaty red fucking marks all over your whole body.

4391
03:10:02,879 --> 03:10:05,770
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to take some points off of that.

4392
03:10:05,770 --> 03:10:06,270
Really?

4393
03:10:07,049 --> 03:10:09,209
They make sweaty red bands across your whole body.

4394
03:10:09,209 --> 03:10:09,930
It's horrible.

4395
03:10:09,930 --> 03:10:14,219
But I'm gonna have to give you some points with complexity though.

4396
03:10:14,219 --> 03:10:18,110
Your score is very high right now.

4397
03:10:18,110 --> 03:10:22,110
There's a triple PC set, people have dual PC setups.

4398
03:10:22,110 --> 03:10:23,790
And here, this house, we have the triple PC.

4399
03:10:25,340 --> 03:10:27,899
These are all three individual computers?

4400
03:10:27,899 --> 03:10:28,540
Yes.

4401
03:10:28,540 --> 03:10:30,079
Okay, interesting.

4402
03:10:32,479 --> 03:10:35,840
Can you pump through like multiple games or are you trying to do multiple streams?

4403
03:10:36,399 --> 03:10:38,559
It's to stream the streaming PC.

4404
03:10:38,559 --> 03:10:39,360
Okay, what do we got on the wall?

4405
03:10:39,360 --> 03:10:40,889
So these are TVs?

4406
03:10:40,889 --> 03:10:43,040
These are all just TVs.

4407
03:10:43,040 --> 03:10:45,319
Ah, cool.

4408
03:10:45,319 --> 03:10:46,280
Now, here's the kitchen.

4409
03:10:52,989 --> 03:10:54,750
Raj's doors.

4410
03:10:54,750 --> 03:10:56,600
Or your doors.

4411
03:10:56,600 --> 03:11:02,510
Yeah, I mean, we all learn from Russ, you know, how to really protect yourself.

4412
03:11:03,229 --> 03:11:08,829
And why would you not want to like, like, you know?

4413
03:11:08,829 --> 03:11:14,799
Yeah, I thought I did, what did you, where'd you get the flashlight from?

4414
03:11:14,799 --> 03:11:17,280
It's music.

4415
03:11:17,920 --> 03:11:20,700
All right, wait, wait, turn, turn back around.

4416
03:11:21,340 --> 03:11:25,520
I, what, this is just a picture of, who's that a picture of?

4417
03:11:27,129 --> 03:11:30,170
Just some inspiration to get like, just get back to work.

4418
03:11:30,170 --> 03:11:30,409
Got it.

4419
03:11:30,409 --> 03:11:31,049
You know what I mean?

4420
03:11:31,770 --> 03:11:34,360
I do like the wallpaper in here.

4421
03:11:34,360 --> 03:11:36,040
It's, it's very creative.

4422
03:11:36,040 --> 03:11:36,360
Thank you.

4423
03:11:36,360 --> 03:11:40,000
Thank you.

4424
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,719
So, can I see, what's the painting on the wall here?

4425
03:11:42,719 --> 03:11:44,079
On the, this, this side wall?

4426
03:11:44,079 --> 03:11:45,040
If you turn to the left.

4427
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:45,840
It's a window.

4428
03:11:45,840 --> 03:11:46,639
Oh, that's a window.

4429
03:11:46,639 --> 03:11:47,840
Oh, that'd be beautiful yard.

4430
03:11:48,399 --> 03:11:49,680
Every house needs air.

4431
03:11:49,680 --> 03:11:51,840
Well, turn around, let me see the beautiful yard again.

4432
03:11:51,840 --> 03:11:52,879
Turn around, look at the yard.

4433
03:11:52,879 --> 03:11:57,879
Yeah, to the right, where, where that is.

4434
03:11:57,879 --> 03:12:00,680
Yeah, that looks, that's exactly what that looks like on the wall.

4435
03:12:00,680 --> 03:12:02,989
Now go back, go back inside and take a look out.

4436
03:12:02,989 --> 03:12:03,549
I just want to.

4437
03:12:04,879 --> 03:12:06,000
Oh, I mean.

4438
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:06,639
Yeah, that's what I mean.

4439
03:12:06,639 --> 03:12:07,360
Oh, you mean like here?

4440
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:08,479
Yeah, it does, it does.

4441
03:12:08,479 --> 03:12:09,680
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

4442
03:12:09,680 --> 03:12:12,319
It's transparent.

4443
03:12:13,760 --> 03:12:16,719
It's weird that the lake is like kind of an optical illusion,

4444
03:12:16,719 --> 03:12:18,000
kind of like a mirage sometimes.

4445
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:18,799
That's weird.

4446
03:12:18,799 --> 03:12:21,280
It looks good though.

4447
03:12:21,280 --> 03:12:22,079
Let's go upstairs.

4448
03:12:22,079 --> 03:12:32,379
Yeah, let's take a look upstairs.

4449
03:12:32,379 --> 03:12:33,819
What the fuck is that?

4450
03:12:35,559 --> 03:12:36,760
We don't want to go down there.

4451
03:12:36,760 --> 03:12:41,389
What is going on down there?

4452
03:12:41,389 --> 03:12:41,790
All right.

4453
03:12:41,790 --> 03:12:45,870
This is the realtors, one of the realtors son.

4454
03:12:45,870 --> 03:12:47,149
Oh, okay.

4455
03:12:47,149 --> 03:12:48,559
I like it.

4456
03:12:48,559 --> 03:12:50,010
I like it.

4457
03:12:50,010 --> 03:12:50,649
I do appreciate it.

4458
03:12:50,649 --> 03:12:54,649
So the floor, Vinnie and Kraken had this on their walls.

4459
03:12:54,649 --> 03:12:56,969
So it's really nice that you actually made them rugs on the ground.

4460
03:12:57,770 --> 03:12:58,010
Yeah.

4461
03:12:58,010 --> 03:13:00,170
I think that's a pretty good philosophical reason to do that.

4462
03:13:01,159 --> 03:13:01,879
Thank you.

4463
03:13:01,879 --> 03:13:03,950
I couldn't find any lights.

4464
03:13:05,420 --> 03:13:05,979
Wait, that's a.

4465
03:13:07,979 --> 03:13:10,090
That's what came up when I searched for lights.

4466
03:13:10,090 --> 03:13:12,620
If you're wondering, these don't turn on either.

4467
03:13:13,340 --> 03:13:19,079
Do you?

4468
03:13:19,079 --> 03:13:19,879
Okay, poke.

4469
03:13:19,879 --> 03:13:20,840
Very important question.

4470
03:13:21,959 --> 03:13:23,479
Do you have a bathroom?

4471
03:13:24,729 --> 03:13:26,649
Yes, I'll get there right now.

4472
03:13:26,649 --> 03:13:32,920
Some music.

4473
03:13:32,920 --> 03:13:39,260
So here's the bathroom.

4474
03:13:39,260 --> 03:13:48,829
Oh, like behind you or this is the bathroom here.

4475
03:13:48,829 --> 03:13:50,510
Where do you go to the bathroom?

4476
03:13:50,510 --> 03:13:51,870
If I have to piss, where do I go?

4477
03:13:53,479 --> 03:14:00,780
Um, I fucking can't.

4478
03:14:00,780 --> 03:14:01,180
All right.

4479
03:14:01,979 --> 03:14:05,770
So what is there?

4480
03:14:05,770 --> 03:14:06,969
Is that a security camera?

4481
03:14:08,379 --> 03:14:14,040
Well, you want to have safety and that's the actual design of the room.

4482
03:14:15,559 --> 03:14:20,239
Is going that way.

4483
03:14:20,239 --> 03:14:20,799
What's in that room?

4484
03:14:20,799 --> 03:14:21,360
What's in that room?

4485
03:14:23,739 --> 03:14:24,239
Yeah.

4486
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:30,719
All right, you're gonna have to get an extra few points for that.

4487
03:14:31,360 --> 03:14:32,479
You have to get a few points for that.

4488
03:14:32,479 --> 03:14:33,760
You actually tricked me.

4489
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:34,639
Okay, you get a few.

4490
03:14:34,639 --> 03:14:35,760
You get a few more points for that.

4491
03:14:36,879 --> 03:14:41,629
Uh, I'm going to bring complexity down a little because there's no room there,

4492
03:14:41,629 --> 03:14:42,829
but I brought your creativity up.

4493
03:14:44,559 --> 03:14:44,959
All right.

4494
03:14:44,959 --> 03:14:45,200
What?

4495
03:14:45,200 --> 03:14:45,600
What is it?

4496
03:14:45,600 --> 03:14:46,399
What's the say on the wall?

4497
03:14:48,200 --> 03:14:50,040
Room room.

4498
03:14:50,040 --> 03:14:54,729
Okay, so you've got and what's that?

4499
03:14:54,729 --> 03:14:57,450
Is that a photo of Ninja?

4500
03:14:57,450 --> 03:14:58,889
I don't have nothing on this PC.

4501
03:14:58,889 --> 03:15:01,049
So Connor did also by sort of.

4502
03:15:01,049 --> 03:15:04,329
I can't talk.

4503
03:15:04,329 --> 03:15:05,690
I can't even hear myself.

4504
03:15:06,569 --> 03:15:07,610
Connor did a similar.

4505
03:15:09,049 --> 03:15:11,129
If you stand that way and then open it, it won't hit you.

4506
03:15:12,250 --> 03:15:12,889
If you go.

4507
03:15:12,889 --> 03:15:13,290
All right.

4508
03:15:13,930 --> 03:15:16,809
Yeah, go just turn all the turn off the.

4509
03:15:16,809 --> 03:15:18,010
Yeah, because then we can talk.

4510
03:15:18,649 --> 03:15:23,020
Is that question mark to signify the Riddler?

4511
03:15:23,579 --> 03:15:34,170
Well, that's just to really, you know, I don't think the image loaded.

4512
03:15:34,729 --> 03:15:38,590
That would make sense.

4513
03:15:38,590 --> 03:15:39,469
It's probably an area.

4514
03:15:41,469 --> 03:15:42,909
What was supposed to be there?

4515
03:15:42,909 --> 03:15:43,389
What'd you say?

4516
03:15:45,229 --> 03:15:47,309
Honestly, one of the other photos, probably Ninja.

4517
03:15:48,110 --> 03:15:48,510
Okay.

4518
03:15:48,510 --> 03:15:48,909
All right.

4519
03:15:48,909 --> 03:15:49,950
Light the question mark.

4520
03:15:51,389 --> 03:15:52,350
It looks good itself.

4521
03:15:52,350 --> 03:15:53,469
Obviously, brutally honest.

4522
03:15:54,190 --> 03:15:55,229
I mean, I think it looks great.

4523
03:15:55,790 --> 03:15:56,909
No, what is the solar?

4524
03:15:57,549 --> 03:15:58,760
Oh, that's the solar.

4525
03:15:58,760 --> 03:15:59,399
Okay.

4526
03:15:59,399 --> 03:16:00,600
I thought it was a cell tower.

4527
03:16:01,899 --> 03:16:08,700
And honestly, this, this is for like the rich who just want to throw off burglars and stuff.

4528
03:16:09,500 --> 03:16:13,899
Imagine you came in and where would, you know, you'd have no idea how to get there.

4529
03:16:14,700 --> 03:16:17,899
It would throw me off because it did throw me off because I actually did not know if

4530
03:16:17,899 --> 03:16:18,780
it was a real room or not.

4531
03:16:18,780 --> 03:16:19,420
So you got me.

4532
03:16:21,559 --> 03:16:21,799
All right.

4533
03:16:21,799 --> 03:16:23,319
Is there anything else for us to see poker?

4534
03:16:23,319 --> 03:16:24,440
Is that, is that pretty much it?

4535
03:16:25,399 --> 03:16:29,319
Honestly, that's all I was able to figure out.

4536
03:16:29,319 --> 03:16:29,959
All right.

4537
03:16:29,959 --> 03:16:32,989
So I'll give you the grades, the grades that I have for you so far.

4538
03:16:32,989 --> 03:16:36,920
I really did like your airport philosophy.

4539
03:16:36,920 --> 03:16:41,079
The reason why your philosophy is so much higher is you have a 95 in philosophy

4540
03:16:41,079 --> 03:16:47,479
because I'm getting inside kind of your head a little bit here because you're you get back.

4541
03:16:47,479 --> 03:16:49,879
You're like, fuck, I'm 30, 40 minutes late.

4542
03:16:49,879 --> 03:16:50,840
I need to do something.

4543
03:16:50,840 --> 03:16:51,879
I'm going to do an airport.

4544
03:16:51,879 --> 03:16:52,680
And it's like, no, you know what?

4545
03:16:52,680 --> 03:16:53,319
Fuck it.

4546
03:16:53,319 --> 03:16:56,280
I'm going to change it from an airport to like an anti-burglar house.

4547
03:16:56,280 --> 03:16:56,920
And then you're like, fuck it.

4548
03:16:56,920 --> 03:16:59,129
I'm just going to put garage doors everywhere.

4549
03:16:59,129 --> 03:17:03,520
You, you were like up against the clock and you made it happen.

4550
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:06,879
And the philosophy of you making that happen and adding these comedic elements

4551
03:17:06,879 --> 03:17:10,159
is what puts you at a 95 for philosophy.

4552
03:17:10,159 --> 03:17:18,959
Unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately.

4553
03:17:24,569 --> 03:17:27,389
Sorry, I was waiting for a sound effect.

4554
03:17:27,389 --> 03:17:27,950
Sorry.

4555
03:17:27,950 --> 03:17:32,909
Your, your, your cleanliness was pretty much zero.

4556
03:17:33,549 --> 03:17:34,670
It's very dirty outside.

4557
03:17:35,709 --> 03:17:37,389
It was filthy out there.

4558
03:17:37,389 --> 03:17:39,149
It looks like you took a little bit of less time.

4559
03:17:39,149 --> 03:17:41,229
And this trash, that's a trash bag right there.

4560
03:17:41,229 --> 03:17:42,030
Well, that's not a trash bag.

4561
03:17:42,030 --> 03:17:42,430
What is that?

4562
03:17:44,030 --> 03:17:46,030
Oh, I thought that I thought that was a trash bag.

4563
03:17:46,030 --> 03:17:48,350
OK, but anyways, that's it.

4564
03:17:48,350 --> 03:17:51,479
You got a, you got a 60 for cleanliness.

4565
03:17:51,479 --> 03:17:52,360
It was very dirty.

4566
03:17:52,360 --> 03:17:54,440
And I dirty enough where I can overlook it.

4567
03:17:55,500 --> 03:17:57,899
I would probably give you like a, maybe like a 65

4568
03:17:58,889 --> 03:18:08,239
because of if you just go outside and just take a look around.

4569
03:18:08,239 --> 03:18:12,000
This paint cans, this wood, the flamethrower ran out.

4570
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:12,559
Yeah.

4571
03:18:12,559 --> 03:18:14,399
And like the scaffolding is still there.

4572
03:18:16,559 --> 03:18:16,959
Basement.

4573
03:18:16,959 --> 03:18:18,639
Everyone's saying go to the basement, go to the basement.

4574
03:18:18,639 --> 03:18:19,600
Can you show us the basement?

4575
03:18:23,559 --> 03:18:24,920
Chad, let's get a grade.

4576
03:18:28,959 --> 03:18:30,639
Chad is currently giving you an A.

4577
03:18:30,639 --> 03:18:32,440
So we're going to the basement.

4578
03:18:34,059 --> 03:18:35,979
Oh, optical right now.

4579
03:18:35,979 --> 03:18:36,540
Oh, OK.

4580
03:18:36,540 --> 03:18:37,659
Optical illusion is pretty sick.

4581
03:18:38,860 --> 03:18:39,180
Yeah.

4582
03:18:39,180 --> 03:18:40,459
I, yeah, I think you nailed it.

4583
03:18:40,459 --> 03:18:41,500
I think you knocked it out of the park.

4584
03:18:42,379 --> 03:18:43,739
It just was very dirty.

4585
03:18:43,739 --> 03:18:45,819
So that's going to hurt your grade a lot.

4586
03:18:45,819 --> 03:18:48,379
But Chad has given you an A, which is a 95.

4587
03:18:48,379 --> 03:18:49,360
Yes.

4588
03:18:49,360 --> 03:18:52,620
So we here's where you stand now.

4589
03:18:52,620 --> 03:18:54,299
You stand poke.

4590
03:18:54,299 --> 03:19:01,239
You had a creativity of 95 as an A complexity of an 83.

4591
03:19:02,250 --> 03:19:04,569
Now, the reason why I give the, I just,

4592
03:19:04,889 --> 03:19:06,409
the big paintings on the wall.

4593
03:19:06,969 --> 03:19:08,969
I mean, you said you even said it yourself.

4594
03:19:08,969 --> 03:19:11,450
You didn't even know what images you had on this computer.

4595
03:19:11,450 --> 03:19:14,250
So yes, that's I got to bring some points down for that.

4596
03:19:14,250 --> 03:19:16,329
So that's an 83 for complexity.

4597
03:19:16,329 --> 03:19:20,489
Plus having a garage door for every single door is it's,

4598
03:19:20,489 --> 03:19:22,409
you know, it took us a while, you know, to open them.

4599
03:19:22,969 --> 03:19:23,850
And then they're very loud.

4600
03:19:24,489 --> 03:19:27,260
But your philosophy was a 95.

4601
03:19:27,260 --> 03:19:28,860
Your cleanliness was a 65.

4602
03:19:28,860 --> 03:19:31,579
And Chad gave you a 95 with the grand total poke.

4603
03:19:33,209 --> 03:19:38,750
You're a grade in total with this music in the background.

4604
03:19:39,709 --> 03:19:43,280
You're probably going to be pretty close to being at the top.

4605
03:19:43,280 --> 03:19:45,200
If I'm honest.

4606
03:19:45,200 --> 03:19:45,700
Yes.

4607
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:48,760
Oh, wow.

4608
03:19:49,770 --> 03:19:50,170
All right.

4609
03:19:50,170 --> 03:19:57,100
So you are at an overall grade of 87.5, which puts you, Joel had 87.6.

4610
03:19:58,329 --> 03:19:58,969
Oh, wow.

4611
03:19:58,969 --> 03:20:00,649
It was, it was the cleanliness is what killed you.

4612
03:20:02,190 --> 03:20:03,229
That's worth 15%.

4613
03:20:03,229 --> 03:20:05,879
No, I'll take that.

4614
03:20:05,879 --> 03:20:06,600
Damn.

4615
03:20:06,600 --> 03:20:11,209
80, 87, 87.5.

4616
03:20:11,209 --> 03:20:11,770
Nice job.

4617
03:20:11,770 --> 03:20:12,090
Thank you.

4618
03:20:13,799 --> 03:20:14,200
I loved it.

4619
03:20:14,200 --> 03:20:14,600
I loved it.

4620
03:20:15,420 --> 03:20:15,920
Yeah.

4621
03:20:16,159 --> 03:20:17,680
What did you do?

4622
03:20:17,680 --> 03:20:18,799
Is that as another sponsor?

4623
03:20:19,440 --> 03:20:21,280
I don't even, I don't remember this.

4624
03:20:22,899 --> 03:20:23,540
I think so.

4625
03:20:23,540 --> 03:20:23,700
Yeah.

4626
03:20:23,700 --> 03:20:24,180
It was actually.

4627
03:20:27,790 --> 03:20:28,190
All right.

4628
03:20:29,790 --> 03:20:31,389
What do we have to say about this one?

4629
03:20:31,389 --> 03:20:32,190
This is very good.

4630
03:20:32,989 --> 03:20:33,709
We have some thoughts.

4631
03:20:33,709 --> 03:20:35,069
I would not want to raid this house.

4632
03:20:35,069 --> 03:20:36,909
It would take way too much gunpowder.

4633
03:20:36,909 --> 03:20:37,549
Thank you guys.

4634
03:20:38,430 --> 03:20:40,270
I love the painted on doors.

4635
03:20:40,270 --> 03:20:41,469
It's so funny.

4636
03:20:41,469 --> 03:20:44,909
The garage having to wait for the garage doors every time.

4637
03:20:44,909 --> 03:20:45,870
Oh, my God.

4638
03:20:45,870 --> 03:20:46,590
It's torture.

4639
03:20:47,069 --> 03:20:49,790
Like the idea of like each of the,

4640
03:20:50,430 --> 03:20:54,829
the first two notes playing from each individual radio that is in every room.

4641
03:20:54,829 --> 03:20:55,469
Did you put that?

4642
03:20:56,030 --> 03:20:58,030
Did you put that in or is that just there?

4643
03:20:58,030 --> 03:21:00,989
Yeah, I, I, I looped up.

4644
03:21:00,989 --> 03:21:02,270
I just shortened the song.

4645
03:21:02,270 --> 03:21:04,030
Oh, you took that.

4646
03:21:04,030 --> 03:21:04,829
That's so funny.

4647
03:21:05,870 --> 03:21:06,750
Oh, my God.

4648
03:21:07,709 --> 03:21:09,950
If you were upstairs in that home and someone's at the door,

4649
03:21:09,950 --> 03:21:11,950
you probably wouldn't make it in time.

4650
03:21:11,950 --> 03:21:12,909
I don't think anyone is.

4651
03:21:12,909 --> 03:21:13,790
No one's by the way.

4652
03:21:13,790 --> 03:21:16,110
I love that you painted the whole outside of the house.

4653
03:21:16,110 --> 03:21:17,549
This experiment green.

4654
03:21:18,350 --> 03:21:19,549
This took half the time.

4655
03:21:20,190 --> 03:21:22,110
And it's, it's all splotchy.

4656
03:21:22,110 --> 03:21:23,709
Look how splotchy it is over there.

4657
03:21:24,350 --> 03:21:26,590
The inside of the house was the last 10 minutes.

4658
03:21:28,190 --> 03:21:29,870
I had no idea what I was doing.

4659
03:21:29,870 --> 03:21:30,510
That's so funny.

4660
03:21:30,510 --> 03:21:31,629
Can I give a point?

4661
03:21:31,629 --> 03:21:37,069
Can I like do a zero decimal one extra point friend point?

4662
03:21:37,069 --> 03:21:38,110
Because it's so good.

4663
03:21:38,110 --> 03:21:38,610
Okay.

4664
03:21:39,229 --> 03:21:42,780
Can I like, you know, give points?

4665
03:21:42,780 --> 03:21:45,979
Do you want, you want to, you want to step in and stamp on a point one point?

4666
03:21:48,059 --> 03:21:50,540
Because we're like, you know, we're like tight, right?

4667
03:21:50,540 --> 03:21:51,579
There's so much more.

4668
03:21:51,579 --> 03:21:53,260
I want to see everyone else's things first.

4669
03:21:53,260 --> 03:21:54,139
Let's, let's see everyone else's.

4670
03:21:54,139 --> 03:21:54,780
Okay.

4671
03:21:54,780 --> 03:21:55,180
Okay.

4672
03:21:55,180 --> 03:21:56,059
Let's see everyone else's.

4673
03:21:56,059 --> 03:21:57,340
I appreciate you though, man.

4674
03:21:57,340 --> 03:21:57,819
Damn.

4675
03:21:57,819 --> 03:21:58,219
Thank you.

4676
03:22:00,559 --> 03:22:01,840
Everyone else is doing great too.

4677
03:22:01,840 --> 03:22:03,200
I want to see, I want to see Ludwig's.

4678
03:22:03,760 --> 03:22:03,920
Yeah.

4679
03:22:03,920 --> 03:22:05,040
Lud's up next.

4680
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:05,760
Lud is up next.

4681
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:08,159
So we're going to thank you.

4682
03:22:11,360 --> 03:22:12,000
All right.

4683
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:13,120
Oh, thanks a lot, dude.

4684
03:22:13,120 --> 03:22:13,680
It was awesome.

4685
03:22:14,239 --> 03:22:15,299
We'll see it.

4686
03:22:15,299 --> 03:22:16,340
We'll see how it plays out.

4687
03:22:17,409 --> 03:22:17,729
All right.

4688
03:22:17,729 --> 03:22:18,850
Ludwig, are you, are you ready?

4689
03:22:20,530 --> 03:22:21,030
Yep.

4690
03:22:21,329 --> 03:22:29,489
So Ludwig, I do have to tell you very importantly, there is, you did get a minus two deduction

4691
03:22:29,489 --> 03:22:31,010
to philosophy right off the bat.

4692
03:22:33,250 --> 03:22:34,209
I'm sorry.

4693
03:22:34,209 --> 03:22:37,649
Because we, we had a thing with the, when I unmuted everybody,

4694
03:22:38,290 --> 03:22:42,290
the first person to complain was the one that was going to get minus two points on their philosophy.

4695
03:22:43,170 --> 03:22:46,370
And I think the first thing you said was like, fuck this.

4696
03:22:46,370 --> 03:22:47,090
This was stupid.

4697
03:22:48,420 --> 03:22:49,940
No, I didn't say that.

4698
03:22:49,940 --> 03:22:51,059
I would never say that.

4699
03:22:51,059 --> 03:22:55,760
I forget what you said, but it was very funny.

4700
03:22:58,260 --> 03:23:03,219
But I am, I'm, I'm willing, I'm willing to scrub those points being deducted.

4701
03:23:03,219 --> 03:23:08,450
Look, it's fine because I think I'm going to score 100 in philosophy.

4702
03:23:08,450 --> 03:23:10,770
And so a 98 is still an A plus.

4703
03:23:10,770 --> 03:23:11,090
Really?

4704
03:23:11,090 --> 03:23:11,329
Okay.

4705
03:23:11,329 --> 03:23:12,209
You, you'll double it.

4706
03:23:12,209 --> 03:23:12,770
Give it to that person.

4707
03:23:12,770 --> 03:23:15,180
So you're really confident.

4708
03:23:15,180 --> 03:23:15,500
Yeah.

4709
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:17,979
Because most of my build sucks.

4710
03:23:17,979 --> 03:23:20,379
I mean, I do not have the expertise of other people.

4711
03:23:20,379 --> 03:23:22,860
I do not have the, the cleanliness of other people.

4712
03:23:22,860 --> 03:23:23,260
Okay.

4713
03:23:23,260 --> 03:23:26,979
But philosophy is what this whole build is based off.

4714
03:23:26,979 --> 03:23:27,379
Okay.

4715
03:23:27,379 --> 03:23:30,909
And, and, uh, Jerma, I'm, I'm getting up there in years.

4716
03:23:30,909 --> 03:23:32,930
I turned 28 this week.

4717
03:23:32,930 --> 03:23:36,049
Um, yeah, happy birthday by the way, if everybody didn't know.

4718
03:23:36,930 --> 03:23:37,489
Thank you.

4719
03:23:37,489 --> 03:23:39,010
Uh, it's, it's, uh, it's stupid.

4720
03:23:39,010 --> 03:23:42,290
Uh, and if this was a low score, it'd make my whole year shattered.

4721
03:23:42,290 --> 03:23:46,979
But, uh, what I want you to focus on is history.

4722
03:23:46,979 --> 03:23:47,299
Okay.

4723
03:23:49,180 --> 03:23:49,500
History.

4724
03:23:49,500 --> 03:23:51,180
You know what they say about history.

4725
03:23:51,180 --> 03:23:52,379
You know what they say.

4726
03:23:52,379 --> 03:23:57,139
If you do not learn from history, it is doomed to repeat itself.

4727
03:23:57,139 --> 03:23:57,700
Got it.

4728
03:23:57,700 --> 03:23:58,579
You ever heard that?

4729
03:23:58,579 --> 03:23:59,540
I have, uh, many times.

4730
03:23:59,540 --> 03:23:59,860
Oh yeah.

4731
03:24:00,989 --> 03:24:02,430
That's me that said that.

4732
03:24:02,430 --> 03:24:08,750
And, and, uh, and so today we are going to do an homage.

4733
03:24:08,750 --> 03:24:09,649
Okay.

4734
03:24:09,649 --> 03:24:11,649
To H. H. Ohms.

4735
03:24:11,649 --> 03:24:14,399
Do you know who that is?

4736
03:24:14,399 --> 03:24:16,159
I don't.

4737
03:24:16,159 --> 03:24:17,760
Well, I'll, I'll show you.

4738
03:24:17,760 --> 03:24:18,239
I'll show you.

4739
03:24:18,239 --> 03:24:24,020
Cause, cause first and foremost, um, he's an American.

4740
03:24:24,020 --> 03:24:24,340
Okay.

4741
03:24:24,340 --> 03:24:25,600
You hear that music?

4742
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:31,899
I cannot hear the music.

4743
03:24:31,899 --> 03:24:33,420
You don't hear like the national anthem playing?

4744
03:24:33,420 --> 03:24:35,979
I don't, I can put the national anthem on over here if you want me to.

4745
03:24:35,979 --> 03:24:36,819
No, you're fine.

4746
03:24:36,819 --> 03:24:37,219
You're fine.

4747
03:24:37,219 --> 03:24:37,540
Okay.

4748
03:24:37,540 --> 03:24:38,020
Okay.

4749
03:24:38,020 --> 03:24:45,459
Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light?

4750
03:24:46,860 --> 03:24:50,139
This is our American garage.

4751
03:24:50,139 --> 03:24:50,540
Okay.

4752
03:24:50,540 --> 03:24:57,180
Uh, and, and it's where we are starting our story today to explain who H. H. Ohms is

4753
03:24:57,180 --> 03:25:02,059
because at the end of the day, this is a history lesson for you to learn to not repeat what was

4754
03:25:02,059 --> 03:25:03,020
done in the past.

4755
03:25:03,020 --> 03:25:04,219
Starting with the garage.

4756
03:25:04,219 --> 03:25:06,110
Already a good start.

4757
03:25:06,110 --> 03:25:06,510
Yep.

4758
03:25:06,510 --> 03:25:07,629
Starting with the garage here.

4759
03:25:07,629 --> 03:25:13,969
So H. H. Ohms, uh, was an American, uh, and I made this garage to dedicate, dedicate to him.

4760
03:25:13,969 --> 03:25:15,760
Um, oof.

4761
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:16,639
Oh, you just blew it up.

4762
03:25:17,520 --> 03:25:19,860
No, it was a, it's an explosive entry.

4763
03:25:19,860 --> 03:25:22,899
It's like, oh, okay.

4764
03:25:22,899 --> 03:25:23,700
Okay.

4765
03:25:23,700 --> 03:25:24,180
Yeah.

4766
03:25:24,180 --> 03:25:29,629
Let me actually do a little bit of, you didn't have sound turned on.

4767
03:25:30,190 --> 03:25:30,590
All right.

4768
03:25:30,590 --> 03:25:30,829
Okay.

4769
03:25:31,790 --> 03:25:33,549
I realized now that I didn't.

4770
03:25:33,549 --> 03:25:34,530
I okay.

4771
03:25:34,530 --> 03:25:35,649
I still don't have sound on.

4772
03:25:35,649 --> 03:25:36,049
Okay.

4773
03:25:36,049 --> 03:25:38,049
I volume down.

4774
03:25:38,049 --> 03:25:38,290
Yep.

4775
03:25:38,290 --> 03:25:38,530
Thanks.

4776
03:25:38,530 --> 03:25:39,090
Thanks, Connor.

4777
03:25:39,090 --> 03:25:39,569
Thanks, Connor.

4778
03:25:39,569 --> 03:25:40,610
Stop talking to me ever again.

4779
03:25:40,610 --> 03:25:41,090
Thanks.

4780
03:25:41,090 --> 03:25:41,649
Sorry.

4781
03:25:41,649 --> 03:25:42,370
That was Connor.

4782
03:25:42,370 --> 03:25:45,629
Um, uh, can you even still hear it though?

4783
03:25:45,629 --> 03:25:46,909
I think it's sharing to my screen.

4784
03:25:46,909 --> 03:25:47,229
Hold up.

4785
03:25:47,229 --> 03:25:47,790
I'm resharing.

4786
03:25:47,790 --> 03:25:48,430
I'm resharing.

4787
03:25:48,430 --> 03:25:48,909
Reshare?

4788
03:25:48,909 --> 03:25:50,979
I'm stopping streaming restarting.

4789
03:25:50,979 --> 03:25:51,540
Okay.

4790
03:25:51,540 --> 03:25:53,659
Restarting share.

4791
03:25:53,659 --> 03:25:54,780
If you pull the actual game.

4792
03:25:54,780 --> 03:25:55,340
I'm back.

4793
03:25:55,340 --> 03:25:56,219
There you are back.

4794
03:25:56,219 --> 03:25:57,250
There we go.

4795
03:25:57,250 --> 03:25:57,649
We got it.

4796
03:25:57,649 --> 03:25:58,049
We got it.

4797
03:25:58,049 --> 03:25:58,770
Can hear the birds.

4798
03:25:58,770 --> 03:25:59,569
Yeah, there we are.

4799
03:25:59,569 --> 03:26:00,530
There we are.

4800
03:26:00,530 --> 03:26:02,450
This is our American garage.

4801
03:26:02,450 --> 03:26:05,250
Red, white and blue filled with the American flag.

4802
03:26:05,250 --> 03:26:11,170
Of course, uh, we have our, our turrets, um, which is going to come in handy a little bit later when

4803
03:26:11,170 --> 03:26:14,129
we, when we learn more about H.H. Holmes, who again, you don't know about, right?

4804
03:26:15,250 --> 03:26:16,610
That is a brand new person.

4805
03:26:16,610 --> 03:26:18,100
I don't even know who that is.

4806
03:26:18,100 --> 03:26:18,420
Great.

4807
03:26:18,420 --> 03:26:19,059
Brand new person.

4808
03:26:19,059 --> 03:26:19,459
Love that.

4809
03:26:19,459 --> 03:26:19,860
Love that.

4810
03:26:19,860 --> 03:26:23,489
So let's, let's talk more about it as we enter the backyard and you can see here.

4811
03:26:23,489 --> 03:26:25,010
Look at the walls, right?

4812
03:26:25,010 --> 03:26:25,889
Paint it all the way through.

4813
03:26:25,889 --> 03:26:26,850
Looks really nice.

4814
03:26:26,850 --> 03:26:27,250
Yeah.

4815
03:26:27,250 --> 03:26:30,079
Um, uh, do not enter.

4816
03:26:30,079 --> 03:26:31,440
Ooh, okay.

4817
03:26:31,440 --> 03:26:32,559
No, no doors.

4818
03:26:32,559 --> 03:26:34,510
No doors on the back.

4819
03:26:34,510 --> 03:26:38,909
It's nope because the house was a confusing design because H.H. Holmes.

4820
03:26:38,909 --> 03:26:44,670
Jeremo, this is where I should, uh, tell you he was America's first serial killer.

4821
03:26:44,670 --> 03:26:46,989
Oh, okay.

4822
03:26:47,629 --> 03:26:48,270
Okay.

4823
03:26:48,270 --> 03:26:49,579
Yep.

4824
03:26:49,579 --> 03:26:54,219
He was America's first serial killer and he operated out of Chicago during the Chicago

4825
03:26:54,219 --> 03:26:55,440
world fair.

4826
03:26:55,440 --> 03:27:00,000
He, uh, fell into some affluence through his family and through killing the leader of a

4827
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:05,440
pharmacy and taking over said pharmacy and through that was able to create the murder

4828
03:27:05,440 --> 03:27:08,340
castle.

4829
03:27:08,340 --> 03:27:08,979
I love it.

4830
03:27:08,979 --> 03:27:10,659
This feels like a book report, Ludwig.

4831
03:27:12,290 --> 03:27:14,030
I'm going to tell you histories.

4832
03:27:14,030 --> 03:27:14,909
It doesn't repeat itself.

4833
03:27:14,909 --> 03:27:15,469
Yeah, go on.

4834
03:27:15,469 --> 03:27:17,469
Uh, we're here.

4835
03:27:17,469 --> 03:27:21,950
So the murder, the murder castle and, uh, uh, much like this project was developed very

4836
03:27:21,950 --> 03:27:24,110
quickly by many different developers.

4837
03:27:24,110 --> 03:27:27,389
Uh, and for me to emulate that, I took suggestions from my chat.

4838
03:27:27,389 --> 03:27:27,709
Okay.

4839
03:27:27,709 --> 03:27:29,309
To, uh, to create this.

4840
03:27:29,309 --> 03:27:34,420
So, so you'll notice the, the long, uh, winding narrow halls.

4841
03:27:35,219 --> 03:27:39,840
It's like a G mod map that hasn't put head textures put on it.

4842
03:27:39,840 --> 03:27:41,040
Uh, white all the way through.

4843
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:42,180
Very clean.

4844
03:27:42,180 --> 03:27:42,659
Mind you.

4845
03:27:42,659 --> 03:27:43,700
It's very clean.

4846
03:27:43,700 --> 03:27:46,959
I will say you're starting at a hundred paint everywhere.

4847
03:27:46,959 --> 03:27:49,979
No spots missed at all.

4848
03:27:49,979 --> 03:27:50,299
None.

4849
03:27:50,299 --> 03:27:50,540
Yeah.

4850
03:27:51,870 --> 03:27:52,670
None at all.

4851
03:27:52,670 --> 03:27:55,860
Um, it's a maze house though.

4852
03:27:55,860 --> 03:27:57,459
It's, it's, it's, it's not a maze.

4853
03:27:57,459 --> 03:27:59,860
So that's, and that's, and I knew you'd say that because there's been a lot of

4854
03:27:59,860 --> 03:28:00,420
maze houses.

4855
03:28:00,420 --> 03:28:02,049
They haven't there.

4856
03:28:02,049 --> 03:28:04,530
There have been there, but there've been at least two.

4857
03:28:04,530 --> 03:28:07,409
The terrifying thing about HH homes is he would,

4858
03:28:07,409 --> 03:28:08,370
we love mazes.

4859
03:28:08,370 --> 03:28:09,569
Well, no, this is not a maze Connor.

4860
03:28:09,569 --> 03:28:10,290
I'm not, I'm not like you.

4861
03:28:10,290 --> 03:28:11,010
That'd be crunch.

4862
03:28:11,010 --> 03:28:15,649
Uh, HH homes use several different contractors to make his house.

4863
03:28:15,649 --> 03:28:18,850
That way no individual except for him knew the layout of the home.

4864
03:28:18,930 --> 03:28:21,969
He would then use it as a hotel during the Chicago world fair that people would

4865
03:28:21,969 --> 03:28:22,770
stay at.

4866
03:28:22,770 --> 03:28:27,729
And from the second floor, he would have a trap door to bring people to the first

4867
03:28:27,729 --> 03:28:29,899
floor.

4868
03:28:29,899 --> 03:28:30,620
What is that?

4869
03:28:31,020 --> 03:28:31,260
Okay.

4870
03:28:31,260 --> 03:28:32,940
That's from my hero academia.

4871
03:28:32,940 --> 03:28:34,739
What does it have to do with?

4872
03:28:34,739 --> 03:28:35,700
Did you hear what I said, Jerma?

4873
03:28:35,700 --> 03:28:35,860
Yeah.

4874
03:28:35,860 --> 03:28:39,139
But what does that have to do with HH homes, my hero academia?

4875
03:28:39,139 --> 03:28:40,500
Well, don't worry about this.

4876
03:28:40,500 --> 03:28:46,219
This is just to show the explosiveness of the trap door, bro.

4877
03:28:46,219 --> 03:28:46,540
All right.

4878
03:28:46,540 --> 03:28:47,659
That's pretty cool.

4879
03:28:47,659 --> 03:28:49,260
That's actually pretty cool.

4880
03:28:49,260 --> 03:28:49,500
Okay.

4881
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:53,010
I'm going to have to get, we were starting a little bit high here.

4882
03:28:53,010 --> 03:28:53,409
Yeah.

4883
03:28:53,969 --> 03:28:56,739
You use the environment to make something happen.

4884
03:28:56,739 --> 03:28:58,500
And I'm going to, you're actually pretty high.

4885
03:28:58,500 --> 03:29:01,700
I thought it was just, I thought it was just a white house at first.

4886
03:29:01,700 --> 03:29:01,940
Okay.

4887
03:29:01,940 --> 03:29:02,500
Do you got me?

4888
03:29:02,500 --> 03:29:04,100
That would be embarrassing.

4889
03:29:04,100 --> 03:29:05,059
You got me here.

4890
03:29:05,059 --> 03:29:05,860
I'm actually here now.

4891
03:29:05,860 --> 03:29:06,659
You got me now.

4892
03:29:06,659 --> 03:29:09,409
Well, let me get you the hook then.

4893
03:29:09,409 --> 03:29:11,809
Yep.

4894
03:29:11,809 --> 03:29:18,510
The way HH homes would kill all his victims was by having them go through a trap door

4895
03:29:18,510 --> 03:29:24,479
into the basement where there'd be eaten alive by rats.

4896
03:29:24,479 --> 03:29:25,280
Really?

4897
03:29:25,280 --> 03:29:26,239
That's terrifying.

4898
03:29:26,239 --> 03:29:26,559
Yeah.

4899
03:29:26,559 --> 03:29:27,440
That's horrifying.

4900
03:29:27,440 --> 03:29:28,639
Your cleanliness just went down.

4901
03:29:28,639 --> 03:29:29,200
Horrifying.

4902
03:29:29,200 --> 03:29:30,750
10 points.

4903
03:29:30,750 --> 03:29:32,959
Well, it's a trap door.

4904
03:29:32,959 --> 03:29:33,680
It's the rat room.

4905
03:29:35,680 --> 03:29:36,959
They're located within the rat room.

4906
03:29:36,959 --> 03:29:38,879
But there are rats in your house.

4907
03:29:38,879 --> 03:29:40,319
So we have to be fair.

4908
03:29:40,319 --> 03:29:42,559
But it's in the trap door rat room where you're supposed to kill people.

4909
03:29:42,559 --> 03:29:44,159
So it makes sense that the rats are here.

4910
03:29:44,159 --> 03:29:45,420
What's that on the-

4911
03:29:45,420 --> 03:29:46,219
Whatever.

4912
03:29:46,219 --> 03:29:47,020
What's on the wall there?

4913
03:29:47,020 --> 03:29:47,579
Can we find us?

4914
03:29:48,989 --> 03:29:51,899
This is, if looks could kill, you know what I mean?

4915
03:29:55,809 --> 03:29:56,450
Okay.

4916
03:29:56,450 --> 03:30:00,049
So this is where, this is where, so you could be, is that a poker table, blackjack table?

4917
03:30:00,049 --> 03:30:00,530
What's over there?

4918
03:30:00,530 --> 03:30:03,360
What's the philosophy for that being in here?

4919
03:30:03,360 --> 03:30:05,200
I figured the rats would get bored.

4920
03:30:05,200 --> 03:30:07,680
And I wanted to put a poker table for them to play poker at.

4921
03:30:07,680 --> 03:30:09,020
Okay.

4922
03:30:09,020 --> 03:30:09,340
All right.

4923
03:30:12,059 --> 03:30:16,659
Jerma, this is, this is, I hope, an eye-opening

4924
03:30:19,409 --> 03:30:25,409
about the dangers of the past and how not knowing them could make them happen in the future.

4925
03:30:25,409 --> 03:30:26,770
And what I want you to understand-

4926
03:30:26,770 --> 03:30:29,090
Are you gonna kill me?

4927
03:30:30,049 --> 03:30:30,770
What does that mean?

4928
03:30:31,729 --> 03:30:33,170
Are you gonna kill me?

4929
03:30:33,170 --> 03:30:33,889
I'm just teaching.

4930
03:30:34,530 --> 03:30:35,489
This is educational.

4931
03:30:35,489 --> 03:30:36,290
It's educational.

4932
03:30:36,989 --> 03:30:37,549
All right.

4933
03:30:37,549 --> 03:30:40,430
And I just, I want to teach you to just be wary in the future.

4934
03:30:40,430 --> 03:30:43,229
If you ever go to a hotel, make sure it's from a reputable source.

4935
03:30:43,229 --> 03:30:43,549
Okay.

4936
03:30:43,549 --> 03:30:48,610
Because you could end up in H.H. Holm's murder castle.

4937
03:30:49,409 --> 03:30:52,590
Oh, sh-

4938
03:30:52,590 --> 03:30:53,549
That's the end of the tour.

4939
03:30:53,549 --> 03:30:54,590
Oh, all right.

4940
03:30:54,590 --> 03:30:54,909
Shit.

4941
03:30:54,909 --> 03:30:56,079
Okay.

4942
03:30:56,079 --> 03:30:58,940
That's, that's the whole tour.

4943
03:30:58,940 --> 03:31:01,659
I spent most of the time painting everything white.

4944
03:31:01,659 --> 03:31:03,500
Everything was white.

4945
03:31:03,500 --> 03:31:04,540
We have a few questions.

4946
03:31:04,540 --> 03:31:05,819
Yep.

4947
03:31:05,819 --> 03:31:07,100
Yeah, please, please, go ahead.

4948
03:31:07,100 --> 03:31:09,020
Two, I have a few important questions.

4949
03:31:09,020 --> 03:31:09,659
Number one.

4950
03:31:09,659 --> 03:31:09,979
Uh-huh.

4951
03:31:09,979 --> 03:31:10,299
Yep.

4952
03:31:10,299 --> 03:31:12,500
Where's the bathroom?

4953
03:31:12,500 --> 03:31:13,780
Uh, that's a great question.

4954
03:31:13,780 --> 03:31:14,739
The bathroom?

4955
03:31:14,739 --> 03:31:20,860
Let me bring it to you right now.

4956
03:31:20,860 --> 03:31:21,819
Right here.

4957
03:31:21,819 --> 03:31:22,620
Okay, so you did-

4958
03:31:22,620 --> 03:31:24,690
Okay, so this is a bathroom.

4959
03:31:24,690 --> 03:31:25,250
This is-

4960
03:31:25,250 --> 03:31:26,450
This is the toilet bathroom.

4961
03:31:26,450 --> 03:31:27,090
Got it, got it.

4962
03:31:27,090 --> 03:31:28,690
Okay, I do appreciate the fact that it's outside.

4963
03:31:28,690 --> 03:31:29,329
Can you go ahead?

4964
03:31:29,329 --> 03:31:31,170
Just give me, give me the outdoor look again.

4965
03:31:31,170 --> 03:31:31,569
I want to-

4966
03:31:31,569 --> 03:31:33,569
No trash, no, no bullshit's here, right?

4967
03:31:33,569 --> 03:31:34,610
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4968
03:31:34,610 --> 03:31:36,850
No, no, no bullshit here at all.

4969
03:31:36,850 --> 03:31:39,170
You know, I cleaned up the entire yard.

4970
03:31:40,739 --> 03:31:41,780
Chopped down the trees in the front.

4971
03:31:41,780 --> 03:31:42,979
I thought they were a bit tacky.

4972
03:31:42,979 --> 03:31:43,700
Okay.

4973
03:31:43,700 --> 03:31:45,379
Some weeds grew back just because the game was open.

4974
03:31:45,379 --> 03:31:47,059
But, you know, they were, they were gone earlier.

4975
03:31:48,559 --> 03:31:49,360
I, I've-

4976
03:31:49,360 --> 03:31:50,639
So here's what I've got so far.

4977
03:31:50,639 --> 03:31:53,280
I like the fact that you did the garage.

4978
03:31:53,280 --> 03:31:54,479
A lot of people just didn't even-

4979
03:31:54,479 --> 03:31:56,639
You, there's only two or three people that even

4980
03:31:56,639 --> 03:31:58,000
stepped foot in the garage, it seems.

4981
03:31:58,799 --> 03:32:01,790
I do appreciate the fact that the garage is done.

4982
03:32:01,790 --> 03:32:03,629
So, Chad is going to be grading your house right now.

4983
03:32:03,629 --> 03:32:05,389
I'm going to give you my grades that I have so far.

4984
03:32:05,389 --> 03:32:06,670
And you can argue with me if you want.

4985
03:32:06,670 --> 03:32:07,549
We can go through it.

4986
03:32:07,549 --> 03:32:08,420
I have you create-

4987
03:32:08,420 --> 03:32:09,299
I wouldn't dare.

4988
03:32:09,299 --> 03:32:11,139
So creativity, I got you at an 85.

4989
03:32:11,139 --> 03:32:12,879
The fuck?

4990
03:32:12,879 --> 03:32:13,440
85.

4991
03:32:13,440 --> 03:32:16,110
Sorry, um, what, why?

4992
03:32:16,110 --> 03:32:16,430
85-

4993
03:32:16,430 --> 03:32:17,629
Why do you hate me?

4994
03:32:17,629 --> 03:32:21,420
I got you to creativity 85 for a couple of specific reasons.

4995
03:32:21,420 --> 03:32:21,899
One.

4996
03:32:21,899 --> 03:32:22,540
Okay.

4997
03:32:22,540 --> 03:32:24,219
I like the philosophy.

4998
03:32:24,219 --> 03:32:27,120
The philosophy is actually where you're going to get some points back here.

4999
03:32:27,120 --> 03:32:32,000
Because you, you took, you took a theme and you,

5000
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:37,219
your whole house is a gigantic, I got a gigantic history lesson.

5001
03:32:37,219 --> 03:32:38,909
That's really interesting.

5002
03:32:38,909 --> 03:32:40,510
I gave you a 93.

5003
03:32:40,510 --> 03:32:43,360
I gave you a 93 for, for philosophy.

5004
03:32:43,360 --> 03:32:43,840
You also-

5005
03:32:43,840 --> 03:32:46,239
Okay, and that includes the minus two?

5006
03:32:46,239 --> 03:32:46,879
You have 91.

5007
03:32:46,879 --> 03:32:47,280
So it's a 95.

5008
03:32:47,280 --> 03:32:48,799
You have a 91 in philosophy.

5009
03:32:48,799 --> 03:32:49,280
Oh.

5010
03:32:49,280 --> 03:32:50,239
So I forgot to do that.

5011
03:32:50,719 --> 03:32:51,280
Just a moment.

5012
03:32:51,280 --> 03:32:52,879
I apologize on my turn.

5013
03:32:54,399 --> 03:32:56,879
I want to just point out that if you go to that basement, right?

5014
03:32:56,879 --> 03:32:58,159
That's like the garage, right?

5015
03:32:58,159 --> 03:32:59,520
And you flip it upside down.

5016
03:32:59,520 --> 03:33:02,239
Can you show them, can you show them what we have in the basement?

5017
03:33:02,239 --> 03:33:03,040
Oh, the garage, sorry.

5018
03:33:03,040 --> 03:33:04,319
Can you flip it upside down?

5019
03:33:04,319 --> 03:33:05,840
How do you, how do you flip it upside down?

5020
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:06,639
Can you flip it upside down?

5021
03:33:07,440 --> 03:33:08,399
How do you, how do you do that?

5022
03:33:08,399 --> 03:33:09,680
Flip it, can you flip it?

5023
03:33:09,680 --> 03:33:10,479
How do you flip it?

5024
03:33:10,479 --> 03:33:13,520
Ludwig, Chad is giving you, Chad is giving you an F on your house.

5025
03:33:13,520 --> 03:33:14,959
How do you flip it, Connor?

5026
03:33:14,959 --> 03:33:16,030
Flip it.

5027
03:33:16,030 --> 03:33:17,709
Oh, you keep saying flip it.

5028
03:33:17,709 --> 03:33:20,190
Flip it, flip the, flip the house, flip the house, do it.

5029
03:33:20,270 --> 03:33:21,629
Is it like a command?

5030
03:33:21,629 --> 03:33:23,120
Am I doing it?

5031
03:33:23,120 --> 03:33:24,079
G, GV what?

5032
03:33:27,100 --> 03:33:29,819
Oh, you're flipping the house to see what it looks like upside down?

5033
03:33:30,940 --> 03:33:31,739
He's asking me to flip it.

5034
03:33:31,739 --> 03:33:32,459
I don't know how to flip it.

5035
03:33:33,100 --> 03:33:34,540
Only Italics knows how to do that.

5036
03:33:34,540 --> 03:33:35,979
He's the only one that knows how to do that.

5037
03:33:35,979 --> 03:33:37,020
Grav?

5038
03:33:37,020 --> 03:33:37,739
Okay, look.

5039
03:33:37,739 --> 03:33:39,100
All right, close, close the garage door.

5040
03:33:39,100 --> 03:33:39,819
Close it.

5041
03:33:39,819 --> 03:33:41,420
Okay, sure, sure, sure.

5042
03:33:41,420 --> 03:33:43,500
Yeah, how do you flip the house?

5043
03:33:43,500 --> 03:33:43,819
Grav.

5044
03:33:45,020 --> 03:33:45,739
All right.

5045
03:33:45,739 --> 03:33:46,379
How do you do that?

5046
03:33:46,379 --> 03:33:47,340
You have to be inside.

5047
03:33:47,979 --> 03:33:52,620
Okay, I'm inside the house and then I type in Grav.

5048
03:33:52,620 --> 03:33:53,420
Okay.

5049
03:33:53,819 --> 03:33:55,100
Ludd, you had a great intro.

5050
03:33:55,100 --> 03:33:55,739
You had your intro.

5051
03:33:55,739 --> 03:33:56,780
You were like informed.

5052
03:33:56,780 --> 03:33:57,340
You were ready.

5053
03:33:57,340 --> 03:33:58,700
You had your history.

5054
03:33:59,500 --> 03:34:00,620
You didn't rattle by Connor right now.

5055
03:34:01,649 --> 03:34:03,969
What I'm trying to say is this is not an American room.

5056
03:34:03,969 --> 03:34:05,649
This is a hidden French room,

5057
03:34:05,649 --> 03:34:08,370
which is everything that America doesn't stand for.

5058
03:34:08,370 --> 03:34:11,729
If you flip it upside down, it's just the French flag of a room.

5059
03:34:11,729 --> 03:34:13,010
There's no stars in the room.

5060
03:34:13,010 --> 03:34:13,729
There's no stripes.

5061
03:34:13,729 --> 03:34:14,370
Where's the stars?

5062
03:34:14,370 --> 03:34:15,090
It's a French room.

5063
03:34:15,090 --> 03:34:16,209
Where's the stars and stripes, Ludd?

5064
03:34:16,209 --> 03:34:18,129
It's red, white, and blue.

5065
03:34:18,129 --> 03:34:18,930
Where's the stars and stripes?

5066
03:34:18,930 --> 03:34:20,049
And look on the outside.

5067
03:34:20,049 --> 03:34:21,489
It's a hidden French room.

5068
03:34:21,489 --> 03:34:23,090
You, I can't stand.

5069
03:34:23,090 --> 03:34:24,290
Look at all the stars.

5070
03:34:24,290 --> 03:34:25,250
It's red, white, and blue.

5071
03:34:25,250 --> 03:34:26,850
I can't get rid of this thing now, Connor.

5072
03:34:26,850 --> 03:34:27,969
You've stressed me out.

5073
03:34:27,969 --> 03:34:28,860
I'm sorry.

5074
03:34:28,860 --> 03:34:29,739
I'll leave you to it now.

5075
03:34:29,739 --> 03:34:30,319
I don't know.

5076
03:34:30,319 --> 03:34:32,540
I don't even know how to get rid.

5077
03:34:32,540 --> 03:34:33,100
All right.

5078
03:34:33,100 --> 03:34:35,020
I got my final grades for you, Luddwig.

5079
03:34:35,020 --> 03:34:36,059
And don't worry.

5080
03:34:36,059 --> 03:34:37,780
I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

5081
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:38,260
Okay.

5082
03:34:38,260 --> 03:34:39,940
So philosophy, you get a 91.

5083
03:34:39,940 --> 03:34:40,659
That's an A.

5084
03:34:40,659 --> 03:34:41,459
That's an A minus.

5085
03:34:41,459 --> 03:34:43,379
And we had an awesome history lesson.

5086
03:34:44,420 --> 03:34:46,500
I really do enjoy the fact that you utilized the garage.

5087
03:34:46,500 --> 03:34:48,020
You didn't just go over there and into the house

5088
03:34:48,020 --> 03:34:50,100
and not do anything with all the pieces.

5089
03:34:50,100 --> 03:34:51,459
You used all the pieces.

5090
03:34:51,459 --> 03:34:52,899
Painting this took a long time.

5091
03:34:52,899 --> 03:34:54,420
That's why you also get pretty high score.

5092
03:34:55,700 --> 03:34:57,379
And I realized most people didn't paint shit

5093
03:34:57,379 --> 03:34:59,219
and then put funny objects inside.

5094
03:34:59,219 --> 03:34:59,700
Yeah.

5095
03:34:59,700 --> 03:35:02,430
So that was a lesson.

5096
03:35:02,430 --> 03:35:04,430
You're an 85 for creativity.

5097
03:35:04,430 --> 03:35:05,069
I want you to show you.

5098
03:35:05,069 --> 03:35:05,549
Look at this.

5099
03:35:05,549 --> 03:35:06,979
Over here is painted.

5100
03:35:06,979 --> 03:35:07,459
Look at that.

5101
03:35:07,459 --> 03:35:08,819
You know how hard it is to get there?

5102
03:35:08,819 --> 03:35:09,540
All right.

5103
03:35:09,540 --> 03:35:11,379
I'm going to give you a couple extra points for complexity.

5104
03:35:13,379 --> 03:35:15,659
I painted in every available corner.

5105
03:35:15,659 --> 03:35:15,899
Yeah.

5106
03:35:15,899 --> 03:35:19,739
Your cleanliness is only a 90 because there was rats.

5107
03:35:19,739 --> 03:35:23,500
And I know that's on theme and on brand and everything.

5108
03:35:23,500 --> 03:35:24,299
It's part of the story.

5109
03:35:24,299 --> 03:35:26,620
So I'll give you a 92 on cleanliness.

5110
03:35:27,020 --> 03:35:31,739
You got a 91 philosophy, 92 cleanliness, 80 complexity,

5111
03:35:31,739 --> 03:35:35,010
85 creativity, and chat's grade is a 60.

5112
03:35:35,010 --> 03:35:37,250
So is that the worst chat grade for anyone today?

5113
03:35:37,250 --> 03:35:39,170
That's the worst chat grade that can possibly go out.

5114
03:35:39,170 --> 03:35:40,850
And they must have it out for you for some reason.

5115
03:35:40,850 --> 03:35:42,620
I don't know why.

5116
03:35:42,620 --> 03:35:43,100
You know what?

5117
03:35:43,100 --> 03:35:44,379
I've deserved it from day dot.

5118
03:35:44,379 --> 03:35:45,659
And they saw through me.

5119
03:35:45,659 --> 03:35:49,440
So your final grade, Ludwig, it's probably going to be.

5120
03:35:49,440 --> 03:35:53,389
Let's find out.

5121
03:35:53,389 --> 03:35:56,930
If only the music played through, it probably could have helped.

5122
03:35:56,930 --> 03:35:58,129
But you did put music through.

5123
03:35:58,129 --> 03:35:59,409
I really thought I had.

5124
03:35:59,409 --> 03:36:00,850
The music would have really helped then.

5125
03:36:01,170 --> 03:36:03,260
It would have been huge.

5126
03:36:03,260 --> 03:36:03,500
All right.

5127
03:36:03,500 --> 03:36:05,979
I got you at 92 cleanliness.

5128
03:36:05,979 --> 03:36:09,489
I got you at a 91 philosophy.

5129
03:36:10,049 --> 03:36:11,379
60 is pretty solid.

5130
03:36:11,379 --> 03:36:15,489
I got 60, which puts you at a final score.

5131
03:36:16,930 --> 03:36:19,809
You are at an 83.2 for your final score.

5132
03:36:19,809 --> 03:36:21,809
That is a B, a nearly B minus.

5133
03:36:21,809 --> 03:36:24,260
How does that stack up?

5134
03:36:24,260 --> 03:36:25,379
You're kind of right in the middle.

5135
03:36:25,379 --> 03:36:27,620
I do appreciate the whole thing.

5136
03:36:27,620 --> 03:36:29,299
So here's the thing about theming.

5137
03:36:29,299 --> 03:36:32,100
So everyone else that had a theme, they didn't stick with it.

5138
03:36:32,100 --> 03:36:34,500
A lot of the theming was kind of all, you know, okay,

5139
03:36:34,500 --> 03:36:36,579
we're starting with this theme, but we're moving on to other themes.

5140
03:36:36,579 --> 03:36:43,459
Your entire theme was this H.H. Holmes serial killer house.

5141
03:36:43,459 --> 03:36:45,139
It was the entire thing.

5142
03:36:45,139 --> 03:36:46,260
It was a mistake, Jerma.

5143
03:36:46,260 --> 03:36:49,700
I should have just filled up 12 rooms with 12 different things

5144
03:36:49,700 --> 03:36:52,260
and threw the Green Goblin in and done a little funny voice.

5145
03:36:53,860 --> 03:36:55,540
I don't need to give you guys a history lesson.

5146
03:36:55,540 --> 03:36:56,420
It's your day off.

5147
03:36:56,420 --> 03:36:58,340
Yeah, you gave us a history lesson.

5148
03:36:58,340 --> 03:37:01,620
I'm glad you're learning you definitely would benefit from some funny voices.

5149
03:37:01,620 --> 03:37:03,540
I think he was rumored.

5150
03:37:04,500 --> 03:37:06,979
Two have killed between 20 and 200 people.

5151
03:37:06,979 --> 03:37:09,139
So I just have to give her through the rest of this report,

5152
03:37:09,139 --> 03:37:13,600
although nine were only ever found in here.

5153
03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:15,840
Oh, house flipper drama.

5154
03:37:16,639 --> 03:37:17,440
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

5155
03:37:17,440 --> 03:37:18,079
I'm not talking shit.

5156
03:37:18,079 --> 03:37:19,120
I'm saying it's what I should have done.

5157
03:37:19,120 --> 03:37:20,559
I should have shambles.

5158
03:37:20,559 --> 03:37:24,479
I should have made a the fucking community's falling apart right now.

5159
03:37:25,489 --> 03:37:26,370
I'm not talking trash.

5160
03:37:26,370 --> 03:37:28,850
I should have made a poorly designed tacky house

5161
03:37:28,850 --> 03:37:31,170
filled with furniture that I downloaded offline.

5162
03:37:31,170 --> 03:37:32,690
You're making crash houses.

5163
03:37:32,690 --> 03:37:33,569
Oh, OK.

5164
03:37:33,569 --> 03:37:35,329
Well, it's it's an American house.

5165
03:37:35,329 --> 03:37:39,010
And it's very clean, right? This is a garage that you'd expect a French house

5166
03:37:39,649 --> 03:37:44,690
house red white blue and their star and I couldn't figure out how to get the stars on the ceiling couldn't figure out to get the

5167
03:37:44,690 --> 03:37:46,690
Stars on the ceiling, but here's the thing

5168
03:37:47,329 --> 03:37:48,770
you painted a

5169
03:37:48,770 --> 03:37:53,010
Connor the re Connor you too Connor you had points a lot of points in

5170
03:37:53,649 --> 03:37:56,850
them in cleanliness and in philosophy because

5171
03:37:57,170 --> 03:38:00,469
It's it actually is a huge pain in the ass to paint every single wall in this game

5172
03:38:00,649 --> 03:38:04,129
It's a huge pain in the ass. Even if the wall is completely one color

5173
03:38:04,209 --> 03:38:06,290
It's a huge pain in the ass to paint every single color

5174
03:38:07,180 --> 03:38:12,620
It's liberty blue. Okay, tell me that's not american liberty blue. Anyway, who made the statue? I don't want to

5175
03:38:13,340 --> 03:38:15,069
I don't oh

5176
03:38:15,069 --> 03:38:17,739
Well, I guess it's actually a good point

5177
03:38:17,739 --> 03:38:22,219
Uh, well, I don't want to take up too much of your time here jerma. I'm happy with my score. Uh jerma's chat

5178
03:38:22,219 --> 03:38:26,780
Sorry, I uh disappointed you but I I hope you learned a lesson. We learned we hey

5179
03:38:27,500 --> 03:38:36,030
I learned something today that I didn't know before that's all that matters actually actually true statement. Be safe out there

5180
03:38:36,350 --> 03:38:40,719
All right. See you at work. Did you learn that five to seven minutes is a lot longer than you thought it was

5181
03:38:41,680 --> 03:38:46,239
Uh, how long was that because it to me felt like an eternity. I usually go about one to two minutes

5182
03:38:46,239 --> 03:38:55,229
But who's who's next? Uh, we got coming up next is I believe it is dug. Dug. Dug is next, right? Yes

5183
03:38:55,950 --> 03:38:58,110

And all of those lovely houses around main street that we all know and love as you walk down disneyland. I mean dougney land

5204
03:40:49,940 --> 03:40:55,299
Notice the cartoon flooring really evokes that feeling of like you've been transported into a cartoon world

5205
03:40:56,100 --> 03:40:59,870
And chat this might be a bit scary. We're gonna head into haunted mansion next

5206
03:40:59,950 --> 03:41:03,950
Oh, you're gonna notice that haunted mansion is actually yes, seadog

5207
03:41:04,430 --> 03:41:07,229
A maze and as we go in oh god, sorry. Sorry

5208
03:41:07,629 --> 03:41:13,629
Um, there's terrifying photos up on the walls. You don't know which direction you're going you're moving left and right where the hell is

5209
03:41:13,950 --> 03:41:18,350
Uh this oh look at how scary. Oh another ghost. This place is terrifying, right?

5210
03:41:18,430 --> 03:41:21,950
Really really gets you into the mood not even for children because of how scary this is

5211
03:41:22,590 --> 03:41:25,549
I genuinely don't remember where the ending is

5212
03:41:26,110 --> 03:41:30,350
Uh, it's an actual maze walking through. Oh, can I start to wonder can I pause you for one second?

5213
03:41:30,989 --> 03:41:33,389
Let me pause you for one second. You made an actual maze

5214
03:41:34,379 --> 03:41:40,559
Connor your maze was just like a curly queue with with pictures from your computer. It was very good

5215
03:41:40,879 --> 03:41:42,879
But this is a this is this

5216
03:41:43,120 --> 03:41:48,879
What is it slander? No, no, i'm just saying this is like the first real maze of the night of the four or five maces

5217
03:41:49,360 --> 03:41:57,389
What I will stand for the low mark have you dissed my maze come off of it. What is this? This is real maze

5218
03:41:57,870 --> 03:41:59,870
Look at the mini-map

5219
03:42:00,270 --> 03:42:04,510
Oh mini-map, okay. I just met doug doug for the first time like fucking a month ago

5220
03:42:04,510 --> 03:42:06,510
Oh

5221
03:42:09,950 --> 03:42:14,350
I literally am lost. I do not know how to get out of this. So we might need to stall for okay

5222
03:42:14,350 --> 03:42:20,530
Whoa another ghost watch out for that ghost. Wait. Oh i'm back the entrance. Okay, that's not a bit. I'm

5223
03:42:20,930 --> 03:42:23,170
Okay, hold on. We'll get to the end one sec. All right

5224
03:42:23,729 --> 03:42:27,809
As you continue along your haunted mansion it gets scary and scarier

5225
03:42:28,129 --> 03:42:30,610
Did the creators of dougney land even finish this maze?

5226
03:42:30,690 --> 03:42:32,370
Is there anything actually waiting at the end?

5227
03:42:32,370 --> 03:42:37,969
Is it going to be as scary as those ghosts have been until finally you go even farther and you reveal

5228
03:42:38,700 --> 03:42:47,969
jared fogel's bedroom with a children's bed in front of it truly a haunted ride that any

5229
03:42:48,770 --> 03:42:56,829
Man or child would love that's pretty fucking funny questions on a haunted mansion that I

5230
03:42:57,309 --> 03:42:59,629
Honestly, you're the first of all you're the first person

5231
03:42:59,709 --> 03:43:02,670
You're the first person that made a real maze. Look at the mini-map

5232
03:43:02,909 --> 03:43:06,059
Look at the mini-map go back to the maze and go into the mini-map

5233
03:43:07,409 --> 03:43:11,409
You had actual places where you couldn't really go and then you had to go through a different spot

5234
03:43:11,489 --> 03:43:18,420
You got lost in your own maze that that's a disaster complexity intentionally, right that

5235
03:43:20,360 --> 03:43:23,340
Complexity, I got you at a 98 right now, by the way

5236
03:43:23,899 --> 03:43:29,819
A 98 and let me tell you this is just I am lost one second. This is just haunted mansion

5237
03:43:29,899 --> 03:43:33,500
All right, don't even get me started on adventure land. Okay, here we go. Here we go

5238
03:43:33,500 --> 03:43:33,899
All right

5239
03:43:33,899 --> 03:43:37,020
So as you leave the haunted mansion, uh, you're a little spooked, right?

5240
03:43:37,020 --> 03:43:40,620
You need something to to chill out with maybe you want to go to tomorrow land

5241
03:43:40,860 --> 03:43:47,899
The future of tomorrow or whatever walt disney said and tomorrow land is uh, all of the highest technology that uh, we could find

5242
03:43:48,750 --> 03:43:50,340
Uh, there's

5243
03:43:50,340 --> 03:43:55,559
Oh, there's technological cubes. There's technological cubes. Look at these tech cubes. I think it's a cabinet

5244
03:43:55,940 --> 03:44:03,219
There's technological paintings, which I don't think anybody else had the walls fully tiled with some of the most cyberpunk tomorrow land stuff

5245
03:44:03,219 --> 03:44:08,110
You can find and a bed. I do have furniture in this house. Yes. Okay. I I do have a question

5246
03:44:09,219 --> 03:44:17,139
Yes, what is the philosophy of the placement of the technological cubes because they look a little scattered. Yeah, have you um

5247
03:44:18,219 --> 03:44:27,819
Seen the movie alien. Yes, it was random. I've just put them everywhere. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Yeah, that looks fantastic

5248
03:44:27,819 --> 03:44:32,780
I love it. I love tomorrow world whatever you're going to call it in your royalty free copyright free version

5249
03:44:33,549 --> 03:44:36,190
Right, right. Right. Yeah, it's it's fair use because

5250
03:44:37,219 --> 03:44:42,180
Of the cubes, um, let's head back downstairs. I want to show you our backyard

5251
03:44:42,500 --> 03:44:47,790
Okay, other people tried to make prim and proper little boring lawns. Nobody likes that. Nobody likes suburbia

5252
03:44:47,790 --> 03:44:52,670
What you want is adventure land this outdoor has a mix of different plants and foliage

5253
03:44:52,670 --> 03:44:56,190
It even has a swimming pool that the deep end has a swimming pool

5254
03:44:56,750 --> 03:45:02,690
Adventure land is something for everybody. Look at this bonsai tree pretty cool, right? This is actually a pretty damn good backyard

5255
03:45:03,469 --> 03:45:06,719
There we go. Oh

5256
03:45:08,219 --> 03:45:14,770
I I'm I am I am I don't know doug doug. This is this is looking pretty solid

5257
03:45:15,250 --> 03:45:19,940
Uh, can I can I can you do me a favor? Yeah, could you go to the garage?

5258
03:45:22,819 --> 03:45:29,729
Sorry, you mean what garage I would like you to go to the garage the garage doug. Are you talking about?

5259
03:45:30,350 --> 03:45:35,889
Germaversal studios that place is a dump. My park is much better. Don't go anywhere near germaversal

5260
03:45:36,129 --> 03:45:40,700
I love how you just put it. Well, I want you to open the garage

5261
03:45:42,219 --> 03:45:47,739
Open it the standards at germaversal studios are very subpar. I don't even think they have a ride in here

5262
03:45:50,860 --> 03:45:53,020
I appreciate the fact that you hid the garage

5263
03:45:54,770 --> 03:45:58,850
Yeah, that park sucks. Yeah, there's not much in that there's not much in that park

5264
03:45:59,329 --> 03:46:05,500
Not much in that park certainly not the happiest place on earth now. It's very clean. It's very clean

5265
03:46:06,989 --> 03:46:14,989
The parking lot there's a parking lot. Yeah, I took out the garage door and put in a wall

5266
03:46:16,030 --> 03:46:16,829
Okay, all right

5267
03:46:16,829 --> 03:46:21,540
But why is there a door to the park how a car is supposed to get in here dog dog dog dog?

5268
03:46:21,540 --> 03:46:26,100
What's that right there in the lower left next to the door? Oh boy. Um that

5269
03:46:26,899 --> 03:46:28,620
somebody

5270
03:46:28,620 --> 03:46:34,540
Um miss did park their car in the wrong spot. The door is not the door is not even in the frame either

5271
03:46:36,209 --> 03:46:40,290
But that's again some rogue driver. Yeah, have you been to disneyland? Have you been to the parking lot?

5272
03:46:40,290 --> 03:46:46,770
These people do not know how to drive. Can I ask a question germa? I hate to cut in. Yeah, go ahead. Why?

5273
03:46:47,409 --> 03:46:52,530
Was the garage not the parking lot germa germa?

5274
03:46:53,010 --> 03:46:57,440
Excuse me. Hold on. That's true. Why was the garage not the parking lot?

5275
03:46:59,100 --> 03:47:02,700
Look, you have to build around what the people want some guy

5276
03:47:03,340 --> 03:47:06,780
Charges ford f-150 through my walls and made a huge mess

5277
03:47:06,860 --> 03:47:09,500
And so I built the walls around it and that became the parking lot

5278
03:47:09,579 --> 03:47:13,620
That's why there's this disaster here. None of this was my fault. Well, life gives you lemons

5279
03:47:14,620 --> 03:47:21,819
I do appreciate the parking sign though. That is very nice. I do love it. It is parking for a segue

5280
03:47:21,899 --> 03:47:25,299
Can we go into the body? Can we go into the ball pit? Oh, yeah. Yeah

5281
03:47:25,379 --> 03:47:33,709
So one of our most popular rides is ball pit land and if you've been wondering where the bathroom is, don't worry

5282
03:47:34,110 --> 03:47:37,709
Splash mountain has you covered. I was just gonna ask it multiple

5283
03:47:38,270 --> 03:47:41,309
Pools that you can swim and frolic in and if you need to go to the bathroom

5284
03:47:41,309 --> 03:47:44,190
We do have a urinal at the very end if you can kind of jump up

5285
03:47:44,350 --> 03:47:47,549
Yeah, I was gonna say are you are you peeing out of the water to get to that?

5286
03:47:48,690 --> 03:47:53,170
Um, I think if you jump across you could sort of time it in bursts

5287
03:47:54,399 --> 03:47:58,700
What about the if you take a shit you go in the pool so nobody is swimming in these pools

5288
03:48:00,110 --> 03:48:05,629
Well, I was sort of thinking maybe the middle one would be the shit pool and then splash mountain is the first and the third

5289
03:48:07,920 --> 03:48:08,879
Okay, I get it

5290
03:48:08,879 --> 03:48:13,440
So so only so one of these is used as a place to go to use the bathroom and the other ones could be used

5291
03:48:13,440 --> 03:48:18,270
As a pool that's that's i'm pretty sure if we put enough chlorine in these nobody's is gonna notice

5292
03:48:18,590 --> 03:48:24,180
So i'm gonna dock you on cleanliness for a minute. That's filthy. Uh, i'm gonna have to drop you on cleanliness

5293
03:48:24,829 --> 03:48:28,750
Have you ever been you know, like a wave pool those things are bright yellow. All right

5294
03:48:28,829 --> 03:48:31,790
Everybody just puts up with it. That's part of the amusement park experience

5295
03:48:32,270 --> 03:48:35,309
I am torn because you have philosophically probably

5296
03:48:36,770 --> 03:48:41,469
One of the best I would say one of the best grades here philosophically speaking

5297
03:48:42,239 --> 03:48:48,610
This is wonderful and i'm trying to figure out is this a 95? Is this a higher score?

5298
03:48:48,850 --> 03:48:54,059
Is this a 96 or is this I?

5299
03:48:54,620 --> 03:48:58,430
I'm i'm epcot you have epcot. We've got

5300
03:49:00,030 --> 03:49:06,559
Every other contestant has been spot checked on the corner next to the garage. That's true

5301
03:49:06,879 --> 03:49:12,049
Can we see the corner of the garage dog dog corner? Oh, oh, right. Right. Right. Yeah

5302
03:49:12,129 --> 03:49:19,540
See that as part of our adventure land expansion was left untidy. Let me back. Let's check it

5303
03:49:20,860 --> 03:49:24,139
Oh, um, I have no everybody neglected hooligans at this park

5304
03:49:24,139 --> 03:49:28,299
Everybody needs to get in there and kick them out. We're if and if the park is successful enough

5305
03:49:28,299 --> 03:49:29,659
We will purchase

5306
03:49:29,659 --> 03:49:32,940
Germaversal studios and just kick them out of here. This has gone on too long

5307
03:49:33,180 --> 03:49:36,299
I'm going to give you a 100 on creativity because I really think you deserve it

5308
03:49:36,940 --> 03:49:39,739
I think I think you actually deserve a perfect score for creativity

5309
03:49:40,700 --> 03:49:48,610
I think you absolutely nailed it. This took you had to bring in custom things here and I think you absolutely crushed it

5310
03:49:49,010 --> 03:49:51,010
On complexity i'm going to give you a 94

5311
03:49:51,569 --> 03:49:53,569
There was some there was some

5312
03:49:53,729 --> 03:49:55,729
Doors that weren't really in their own place

5313
03:49:55,889 --> 03:49:59,569
There were some walls that were constructionally had some problems the garage had wasn't anything there

5314
03:49:59,809 --> 03:50:02,450
There also was the problem with the dirt and then the debris

5315
03:50:03,170 --> 03:50:07,440
To the left of the garage, but I do think it was phenomenal. Do you have a second floor?

5316
03:50:09,280 --> 03:50:13,280
Uh, yeah, that's tomorrow land. So that yes, right that was that was part of the second floor, right?

5317
03:50:13,280 --> 03:50:18,620
Okay, so just making sure like this is all there was on the second floor. That's nothing behind

5318
03:50:18,620 --> 03:50:21,100
Okay, and the door if we see the tomorrow land door

5319
03:50:22,350 --> 03:50:28,030
It's a little also perfectly locked into place you see in the future of tomorrow

5320
03:50:28,590 --> 03:50:37,020
Doors are more of a philosophical concept very philosophical. I might add I love it. I think it was fantastic

5321
03:50:37,020 --> 03:50:39,020
I think you're going to get probably at least an a

5322
03:50:39,360 --> 03:50:46,129
Uh, we need to see what chat says what is chat giving for a grade chat is also giving you an a so you that is also

5323
03:50:46,129 --> 03:50:52,819
That is a full nine. That is a 95 from chat. Thank you. You've got a you've got a great great score here

5324
03:50:52,899 --> 03:51:02,049
Let's figure it out. You're gonna be a pretty high probably top of the class. I'd say pretty high 94 in complexity a

5325
03:51:02,610 --> 03:51:05,969
90 and cleanliness of that back area really gets everybody

5326
03:51:06,889 --> 03:51:14,770
Philosophy, I feel like you did a lot with your philosophy here. I think it's a little low

5327
03:51:15,520 --> 03:51:22,620
Hey, and you got to admit with the doors consistent consistent philosophy throughout. I'm gonna give you a 97 for philosophy. Let's go

5328
03:51:23,420 --> 03:51:25,899
I really think that it should be somewhere higher than a day

5329
03:51:28,059 --> 03:51:31,579
And then chats grade is also an a which puts you at a grand total of

5330
03:51:35,530 --> 03:51:37,959
96.0

5331
03:51:39,549 --> 03:51:42,719
Thank you chef. It's alex is currently at 96.5

5332
03:51:44,750 --> 03:51:51,139
Both 96s. You should both should be very proud of yourselves for your creativity complexity cleanliness

5333
03:51:53,459 --> 03:52:01,629
Wonderful wonderful job doug doug. That was fucking phenomenal. Thank you. All right, so we got one more

5334
03:52:01,709 --> 03:52:03,950
We have connor eats pants is the last one

5335
03:52:04,430 --> 03:52:08,989
Right, no, oh my god, why can I not think you know why?

5336
03:52:11,149 --> 03:52:13,149
No, get jared off the screen

5337
03:52:13,629 --> 03:52:15,629
Jared jump scared me jared jump scared me

5338
03:52:16,110 --> 03:52:22,270
It's because it's because i'm looking over at my sheet and because we moved you you're like not on the sheet over here anymore

5339
03:52:22,270 --> 03:52:24,270
So you're like out of my brain

5340
03:52:24,350 --> 03:52:31,950
All right. It's your turn rt. I promise I promise I promise I promise I promise. All right, let's let's get it

5341
03:52:31,950 --> 03:52:33,950
Let's get it. Let's get it

5342
03:52:34,909 --> 03:52:38,989
Um stream quality is a better text readability and 30 fps. Is it? Yes

5343
03:52:40,559 --> 03:52:46,159
Go he hates rt. He hates rt. It's cord crashing is going to be your worst nightmare now

5344
03:52:47,139 --> 03:52:52,020
No, you had the opportunity and the discord just all right. Let me take a look. Uh, can you move around?

5345
03:52:52,260 --> 03:52:56,260
It's it's actually okay. Um, I'm actually glad i'm going at the spot

5346
03:52:56,260 --> 03:52:58,340
I did because I think what my house here

5347
03:52:58,899 --> 03:53:03,219
There's going to be a little bit of anticipation because I actually gonna quote germa here

5348
03:53:03,700 --> 03:53:08,579
If your whole house was a barbie house, it would have been a lot higher. It was a view in criken's house

5349
03:53:09,219 --> 03:53:12,579
Um, no, i've actually produced a no

5350
03:53:13,780 --> 03:53:15,780
barbie dream house

5351
03:53:16,180 --> 03:53:19,620
Uh based on the old doll house toys

5352
03:53:20,260 --> 03:53:22,260
Um for you to play with today

5353
03:53:22,819 --> 03:53:27,139
Um, let's make our way on side. But first and foremost haven't just left this out here

5354
03:53:27,219 --> 03:53:31,950
What do you mean you haven't left it out here? Here's some strawberry ice cream take with you

5355
03:53:32,750 --> 03:53:35,250
We thought about it. Oh, we thought about it thematically

5356
03:53:35,709 --> 03:53:38,510
Oh shit, let's step on and holy shit

5357
03:53:38,670 --> 03:53:43,469
Was to try and get the classic feel of a traditional barbie playhouse, you know

5358
03:53:43,469 --> 03:53:49,469
So it's a bit plasticky feeling as you go through it, but the colors uniform have a little elegance of style

5359
03:53:49,549 --> 03:53:51,549
You have your nice windows. You have your lights

5360
03:53:52,430 --> 03:53:57,950
A little bit of air to kind of get in here retro tv kind of because you would you would have like kind of old toys

5361
03:53:58,030 --> 03:54:00,750
Based on this like kind of little old things that you stick in the house

5362
03:54:01,149 --> 03:54:03,469
When you play with one of these toys sets back in the day

5363
03:54:03,950 --> 03:54:04,750
You know

5364
03:54:04,750 --> 03:54:10,030
I tried to kind of really base it on kind of like the earlier ones from the 60s when mattel were making these way way back

5365
03:54:10,270 --> 03:54:14,190
So we've actually got open access back just so you can kind of get your hands in there

5366
03:54:14,190 --> 03:54:17,629
You know if you're playing with as a kid, you've got your kitchen unit. Of course, you can play with it, too

5367
03:54:18,190 --> 03:54:21,229
You also have a complete pool side

5368
03:54:21,790 --> 03:54:24,989
Beach area we've sanded down a lot of the garden here

5369
03:54:24,989 --> 03:54:29,950
But also some grassy patches just to try and make it look distinct got to get the barbie brandon in here as well

5370
03:54:30,030 --> 03:54:30,510
Sure

5371
03:54:30,510 --> 03:54:35,549
Okay, you get a lot of stickers of barbie in these old play sets too just to really kind of hammer home

5372
03:54:36,190 --> 03:54:38,989
What it is, you know, they're big on the brand and they were back in the day

5373
03:54:39,629 --> 03:54:44,430
We built our own little bench here assemble this so you can just have it like a nice little hold on pause for a second pause

5374
03:54:44,670 --> 03:54:48,270
This is all very wonderful. You've even got the little dirt. You've got the dirt

5375
03:54:48,750 --> 03:54:54,260
Under the bench in an artistic way on it and like because your legs are going to kick some of it away

5376
03:54:54,340 --> 03:54:59,059
No, we thought about that. Yeah, that's just like you you've shaped it. You've you've sculpted this

5377
03:54:59,139 --> 03:55:04,829
This is this is a sculpture. This is a sculpture you've made. Okay, continue. You're way too kind

5378
03:55:04,909 --> 03:55:05,950
You're way too kind

5379
03:55:05,950 --> 03:55:08,190
We have like a more little sticker of barbie here as well

5380
03:55:08,190 --> 03:55:09,870
Just so she greets you when you're coming in the door

5381
03:55:09,870 --> 03:55:12,190
You have a lot of these things just as you go about in the house

5382
03:55:12,909 --> 03:55:14,909
Uh, if we take a look upstairs

5383
03:55:15,229 --> 03:55:20,670
We tried again to just try and give this kind of an open feeling. We got all the essentials here is all the clothes

5384
03:55:21,469 --> 03:55:24,670
Um, you know because barbie famous for our fashion through the years

5385
03:55:24,750 --> 03:55:26,909
We really want to make sure that we have that as part of it

5386
03:55:27,229 --> 03:55:29,069
Here is classic kind of style bedroom

5387
03:55:29,069 --> 03:55:31,309
We went for a bit of an urban feel maybe in the back a bit

5388
03:55:31,549 --> 03:55:34,510
But also kind of want to keep it true to barbie have that in here

5389
03:55:34,829 --> 03:55:38,030
Was the were the walls not being pink a time constraint?

5390
03:55:39,379 --> 03:55:41,379
No, no, it was actually it was a deliberate choice

5391
03:55:41,379 --> 03:55:46,979
We wanted that kind of the contrast in background because it makes these walls pop more if you actually have a brick wall in the back

5392
03:55:47,299 --> 03:55:49,860
It's what in a lot of urban dwellings, you'll kind of get that look

5393
03:55:50,819 --> 03:55:55,700
And actually they incorporated that in some of the classic barbie dream houses. I'll have you know, my grandmother had one

5394
03:55:57,010 --> 03:56:01,329
That's true. Somebody look that up. Is that true? Somebody look that up if it's true. I'll I'll put it higher

5395
03:56:03,500 --> 03:56:07,579
We have a wardrobe room here as well. Of course, you know, you can go through your outfits

5396
03:56:07,979 --> 03:56:09,979
Um now we do have one bit now

5397
03:56:10,700 --> 03:56:15,420
This is classic and I debated doing it this way. Okay. Um

5398
03:56:16,219 --> 03:56:19,809
There is an extensive use of stickers in old barbie homes

5399
03:56:20,209 --> 03:56:25,170
Especially for details like toilets and that because you only get so much plastic in this set

5400
03:56:25,649 --> 03:56:27,489
So you really make use of yes

5401
03:56:27,489 --> 03:56:32,690
they make use of sticker elements for some of these features in the house because otherwise it would just

5402
03:56:33,010 --> 03:56:38,129
Ramp up the retail price and I want to try and stay true to the vision of it being a toy

5403
03:56:38,610 --> 03:56:44,770
And you know affordable in that sense. Ludwig Ludwig. This is a history lesson. It's not about a guy that murdered people

5404
03:56:48,770 --> 03:56:51,729
This is this is the majority of the house here

5405
03:56:52,049 --> 03:56:57,489
Um, we can hop back outside. We have working lights as well. We wired all these they work you have working lights

5406
03:56:57,569 --> 03:57:00,290
Are you the only one that made working lights in the whole game?

5407
03:57:01,329 --> 03:57:04,290
No, wait, somebody else did sure did somebody else have working lights?

5408
03:57:04,930 --> 03:57:12,770
I don't think anybody had working functioning electricity. I did. I just forgot to show it but oh, okay. All right

5409
03:57:13,170 --> 03:57:15,170
He's already killed me by now

5410
03:57:15,489 --> 03:57:17,489
He's all right. You've already died already

5411
03:57:18,129 --> 03:57:23,090
We can take now we can just sit by the pool with our lovely strawberry ice cream and just soak in the day

5412
03:57:23,649 --> 03:57:26,459
We have flowers all over the garden. Yeah, can I see the flowers?

5413
03:57:27,360 --> 03:57:29,680
Yeah, of course. We have a lot like that on the purple ones here

5414
03:57:29,680 --> 03:57:33,600
We have these kind of like this border edge guard of these kind of plastic pots

5415
03:57:34,159 --> 03:57:40,000
And I kind of want it's weird because i'm trying to represent this feeling a bit of plastic as we kind of go about the property

5416
03:57:40,879 --> 03:57:43,840
Um, because again, I like the toys were the reference point for this

5417
03:57:44,479 --> 03:57:48,399
Stock up on some more strawberry ice cream rt. Can you open the garage, please?

5418
03:57:50,000 --> 03:57:54,159
So I did think about the garage in official dream houses back in the day

5419
03:57:54,239 --> 03:57:59,360
The garage would actually be sold separately as would barbie's car. So it's not included

5420
03:58:01,819 --> 03:58:03,500
It's not included

5421
03:58:03,500 --> 03:58:09,659
I actually wanted to remove the garage entirely in the property because to kind of hammer home that idea of it being sold separately

5422
03:58:10,139 --> 03:58:11,100
um

5423
03:58:11,100 --> 03:58:16,459
Because it wouldn't be included. That would be a separate playset and we were focused on barbie's dream clubhouse here

5424
03:58:17,420 --> 03:58:19,229
All right

5425
03:58:19,229 --> 03:58:21,790
That that's a good answer. That's a good answer

5426
03:58:23,379 --> 03:58:29,489
Can you check the corner to the left of the garage? Uh, the corner to the left of the garage sure thing. Just one sec

5427
03:58:32,420 --> 03:58:35,379
It's clean. Oh you keep you get to keep the 100 on clean

5428
03:58:36,180 --> 03:58:41,620
No, don't worry attention to detail like, you know, like I want to keep the garden kind of nice pristine and proper

5429
03:58:42,260 --> 03:58:46,420
Um, I really like actually like kind of like adding the sand in this um as we were going about it, too

5430
03:58:46,420 --> 03:58:50,100
I just thought I added a bit just sort of a bit of contrast from like kind of just

5431
03:58:50,659 --> 03:58:54,500
Modern suburbia that you're getting here and like everyone just doing kind of grassy gardens

5432
03:58:54,500 --> 03:58:56,899
I thought it would look a bit more distinct and again

5433
03:58:56,899 --> 03:59:01,139
It's the idea of kind of dream clubhouse and thinking of the beach and things like that

5434
03:59:01,379 --> 03:59:07,219
Yeah, the the sand is bringing me to the beach. That's really wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful

5435
03:59:07,940 --> 03:59:09,729
Thank you very much

5436
03:59:09,729 --> 03:59:15,969
Uh, I have to i'm fighting with giving you a 98 or a 100 on creativity. I'm trying to uh, 98

5437
03:59:17,379 --> 03:59:19,379
It's a 98. I think for creativity

5438
03:59:20,370 --> 03:59:24,129
It could be 100 that is very kind that is very kind of you

5439
03:59:25,090 --> 03:59:28,659
It's a 90

5440
03:59:28,659 --> 03:59:30,959
It's a 90

5441
03:59:30,959 --> 03:59:33,790
It's a

5442
03:59:33,790 --> 03:59:34,750
Oh

5443
03:59:34,750 --> 03:59:36,739
It's a 99

5444
03:59:36,739 --> 03:59:41,059
It's an oh my god. You're all right your creativity. I'm giving you a 99

5445
03:59:42,209 --> 03:59:43,649
your

5446
03:59:43,649 --> 03:59:48,270
Your complexity i'm giving you an 89 and it's not because it's not a complex house

5447
03:59:48,350 --> 03:59:55,250
It's because it's it's a it's a more it's it's it's a home. This is a regular home. It's not it's not a very complex home

5448
03:59:55,899 --> 03:59:59,979
This is a a home. This is like modeled after those old barbie toys

5449
04:00:00,459 --> 04:00:05,420
Which is exactly the old barbie toys. So you don't actually want too much clutter in there

5450
04:00:05,500 --> 04:00:10,459
Exactly. I've tried i've tried to kind of push over though and add as much details as I can like stuff with the lights and that

5451
04:00:10,700 --> 04:00:14,940
That's true. You know getting plants inside just to kind of make it look nice, but your philosophy

5452
04:00:14,940 --> 04:00:19,500
You've got a 100 that that this I think you've you nailed it on sticking with a theme

5453
04:00:20,239 --> 04:00:24,159
You pulled the theme the whole time. There's not a whole lot of structural problems

5454
04:00:24,399 --> 04:00:30,110
It's very very nicely made all the wiring works in the house. Everything works. That's a 100 for philosophy

5455
04:00:30,110 --> 04:00:33,229
That's a 100 for cleanliness. This is going to be you're going to be isn't really close

5456
04:00:33,629 --> 04:00:37,620
You might be ahead of the class. We're going to see what chat's greatest chat is

5457
04:00:39,059 --> 04:00:43,139
Chat is unanimously giving you an an a 95. Oh my god

5458
04:00:43,979 --> 04:00:48,750
So I think it's very possible. Let we'll do a little bit of the math here. Hold on a second

5459
04:00:49,149 --> 04:00:54,290
We got you at 99. You're way too kind chat. Thank you. Got you 90 for complexity

5460
04:00:54,850 --> 04:01:01,889
Which is 100 ask is there a difference in chat's grade if it's unanimous does that make it 100 or is it a 95 max?

5461
04:01:01,969 --> 04:01:06,340
It's just 95 max just to make it sort of point wise was easier to calculate

5462
04:01:06,579 --> 04:01:10,979
Nobody is going to get a 100 like it's impossible, right? Okay, it's impossible. Great. Great. Great

5463
04:01:11,059 --> 04:01:13,700
Impossible to get a 100 make sense why I didn't get it make sense why I didn't get it

5464
04:01:15,700 --> 04:01:18,979
Well, i'm not gonna for your other reasons, but uh, i'll get you at a

5465
04:01:19,620 --> 04:01:32,239
Drum roll, please ladies and gentlemen rt game is currently at the head of the class with a 96.65

5466
04:01:32,940 --> 04:01:36,459
One tenth of a point higher than his alex. Oh my god

5467
04:01:36,540 --> 04:01:43,069
I actually five tenths of a point higher than doug doug freaking dare you

5468
04:01:43,549 --> 04:01:45,069
That I don't want to be a buzzkill

5469
04:01:45,069 --> 04:01:50,190
But doug neeland does own the rights to barbie and we will be sending you a cease and desist. Oh, that's true

5470
04:01:51,090 --> 04:01:54,110
That's true

5471
04:01:54,110 --> 04:01:58,670
Look the two people who might beat me italics and the barbie house both cheating the law legally

5472
04:01:59,629 --> 04:02:01,629
Listen there can be a brand opportunity

5473
04:02:02,909 --> 04:02:08,670
Mattel is very powerful as I imagine doug neeland is our lawyers will talk right we can work something out here

5474
04:02:08,989 --> 04:02:15,549
We got a killer cut of the ten thousand dollar prize pool that germa put up we can agree to that

5475
04:02:15,629 --> 04:02:16,579
Yeah

5476
04:02:16,579 --> 04:02:18,819
Well, it was actually it was actually a hundred thousand

5477
04:02:18,819 --> 04:02:21,620
But I mean, I don't know why you I don't know why you said it was so low

5478
04:02:22,020 --> 04:02:27,360
But I am okay with this being the model house that germa recreates from scratch rather than doug neeland

5479
04:02:28,000 --> 04:02:32,270
A hundred thousand dollar prize pool. Oh, no, no, no

5480
04:02:32,909 --> 04:02:35,069
All right. That was fucking phenomenal rt

5481
04:02:35,469 --> 04:02:38,829
Uh, thank you very much. You're way too kind. Thank you everyone. It's

5482
04:02:40,430 --> 04:02:45,229
Is really good rt. Yeah, good show. Thank you so much. Everybody did a great job. Come on

5483
04:02:45,309 --> 04:02:51,629
Like uh, but the people's skill levels in the game and some people woke up an hour before and some people with timings trying to get

5484
04:02:51,870 --> 04:02:57,819
Everyone this was a lot of fun. Thanks everybody so much. We got one more. We've got con reeds pants house

5485
04:03:00,579 --> 04:03:04,340
I had a so I had a theme or something. I went for here. Okay

5486
04:03:06,100 --> 04:03:09,700
Let me know if the stream looks good if any change anything. Yeah, let me just turn you up a little

5487
04:03:10,420 --> 04:03:12,000
Let me take a look

5488
04:03:12,000 --> 04:03:15,389
I think you should be good good and stuff

5489
04:03:15,790 --> 04:03:24,049
Oh, let me check it while I load it. I am loading your stream, but it is freezing. Let me

5490
04:03:25,069 --> 04:03:27,680
retry

5491
04:03:27,680 --> 04:03:31,680
Okay, there we go. I can see it. Uh, you look you look pretty good on my end

5492
04:03:32,639 --> 04:03:36,719
I think let me get rid of these grades for rt. I'll tell you when you can go

5493
04:03:37,040 --> 04:03:40,000
So you said you you have a theme that you're going through you said I have a theme

5494
04:03:40,079 --> 04:03:43,920
I'm it's not exactly like a home that you well, I guess you do live in it

5495
04:03:44,319 --> 04:03:49,680
If you're like, I guess someone who's invited to it, but okay, it's not like it's not like a not like a family home

5496
04:03:50,239 --> 04:03:57,120
Uh, it's a it's an orphanage. Um, okay, it's specifically it's a hundred thieves cash app orphanage

5497
04:03:58,079 --> 04:04:02,479
Is what we've made here and if you're wondering about the windows the boards are supposed to be there

5498
04:04:02,959 --> 04:04:06,319
Okay, um, they're supposed to be there so that you know people don't leave

5499
04:04:07,170 --> 04:04:12,610
Um, but yeah, so that those are there for a reason but I I can show you the home check it out in the front yard

5500
04:04:12,850 --> 04:04:17,170
Again, it's an orphanage. So you can't really expect it to always like look so great outside

5501
04:04:18,370 --> 04:04:21,170
There was some digging that didn't look some digging that didn't get done there

5502
04:04:21,729 --> 04:04:24,690
You can listen. We'll get to it. We'll get to it anyways, okay

5503
04:04:24,770 --> 04:04:29,809
And the boards are uh, you're you're you're out of 75 for cleanliness right boards are there for a reason

5504
04:04:30,510 --> 04:04:36,270
Okay, so here we walk in and this is the main room as you can see it's uh red

5505
04:04:37,069 --> 04:04:41,149
We have a couch Connor. We made the same house and I was just sitting there chatting to people

5506
04:04:42,350 --> 04:04:46,780
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I could show you my house that I made. Okay. Well, I have a light switch

5507
04:04:47,889 --> 04:04:52,219
That's actually fucking hilarious. All right, go on go on. I don't want to interrupt you though

5508
04:04:52,219 --> 04:04:56,940
They'll let your lights work your lights actually are functioning. They work. Yeah, they work they work. So that's one light

5509
04:04:57,020 --> 04:04:59,020
Uh, this is the girl's room. Okay

5510
04:04:59,500 --> 04:05:02,540
Or, uh, this is the girl's room we can fit two

5511

Um, we have things girls like in here like a barbie dream house

Um next room over this is the boys room

5517
04:05:23,139 --> 04:05:29,219
We have things boys like like the main characters in michael bay transformers movies like shia laboeuf

5518
04:05:29,870 --> 04:05:32,180

But he's not on hundred thieves anymore. So they had to mark him out. Okay, he used to be on the wall. Okay, I see

5523
04:05:48,510 --> 04:05:50,750
Yeah, and that's just like a window

5524
04:05:50,989 --> 04:05:54,190
Was it like I don't know if there's crutch. Is it a window or is it a is it a pic?

5525
04:05:54,270 --> 04:05:58,190
Can you can you get closer for us? It's a window. I can't I don't know how to crouch

5526
04:05:59,069 --> 04:06:01,500
Uh, I don't think you can okay

5527
04:06:01,579 --> 04:06:06,219
It's actually I might not the kid might have actually put that on the wall next to him to simulate

5528
04:06:06,540 --> 04:06:13,579
Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Anyways, that was the boys room. Nice. This was an accident

5529
04:06:13,819 --> 04:06:17,420
There's supposed to be like a door here. Fortunately, we won't get into that

5530
04:06:17,500 --> 04:06:20,059
Okay, this is the hundred thieves cash app kitchen juvie

5531
04:06:20,620 --> 04:06:22,620
We have brought to you by courage jd

5532
04:06:22,940 --> 04:06:25,899
And we have courage on the wall. You have a nice sink

5533
04:06:29,739 --> 04:06:31,739
This is where you get the juvie in it

5534
04:06:32,219 --> 04:06:37,659
I'm gonna get okay. I'm for creativity. I mean you may I i'm gonna give you so far. I got you at an 80

5535
04:06:38,690 --> 04:06:42,370
Okay, I got you an 80 so far. Well, we'll keep getting that up. Don't worry

5536
04:06:42,530 --> 04:06:47,569
Okay, this is the back door here is the repurposed from a sears that shut down

5537
04:06:47,889 --> 04:06:50,690
We kind of just took the glass sliding door. We like the blue

5538
04:06:51,659 --> 04:06:56,670
Um, but yeah, so that that's that uh, we could go. I don't know where we could go next

5539
04:06:56,670 --> 04:07:00,829
We could go upstairs next. Yeah, I i'd like to see the upstairs. That would be good again

5540
04:07:00,989 --> 04:07:06,030
It's it's tough to get funding for an orphanage. So they kind of make make what's going on with the window?

5541
04:07:06,110 --> 04:07:10,399
Hold on. Is there a window you got a window here on next to the door to the right?

5542
04:07:10,959 --> 04:07:18,239
Yeah, no like this one. Yeah, is that part of another window or is that a just half window lighting natural lighting?

5543
04:07:18,319 --> 04:07:21,520
Well, the sun is the sun is due south. So it's not hitting you this way

5544
04:07:21,760 --> 04:07:25,889
Well at this time of day, of course, but yeah, I mean hold on. Give me a minute

5545
04:07:28,420 --> 04:07:34,979
There's a sleep button. Oh, you can't sleep with this one. Actually. All right. So what what do you got?

5546
04:07:35,379 --> 04:07:38,260
Oh, you you are the first person to use the house

5547
04:07:39,379 --> 04:07:41,780
Yeah, I think that's worth at least a couple points in philosophy

5548
04:07:42,420 --> 04:07:44,399
And the sun's there somewhere

5549
04:07:44,399 --> 04:07:45,680
anyways, uh

5550
04:07:45,680 --> 04:07:50,639
Upstairs we have we have a couple different usages of the main usage of upstairs is the playroom

5551
04:07:50,719 --> 04:07:56,159
You'll see it in the corner, but okay kind of just having like the the owner's bed is right there

5552
04:07:56,399 --> 04:08:01,680
Okay, and we want to keep it like motivating for the kids. So like we have ted lasso on the wall kids love ted lasso

5553
04:08:02,540 --> 04:08:04,540
Uh, this is uh, this is the bath

5554
04:08:04,780 --> 04:08:06,780
What it's I see says, uh

5555
04:08:08,610 --> 04:08:14,190

5556
04:08:14,270 --> 04:08:16,270
That's oh, okay. I see. Okay

5557
04:08:16,750 --> 04:08:18,750
Okay, so this is a toy

5558
04:08:19,459 --> 04:08:26,940
Is there any is there a bathroom? What right here? So that's a wait. So that's a bathroom

5559
04:08:27,420 --> 04:08:33,940
There's no toilet. That's what they use. Well, I okay. Did you not even look in the room? I

5560
04:08:34,799 --> 04:08:36,670
did

5561
04:08:36,670 --> 04:08:38,940
you have

5562
04:08:38,940 --> 04:08:42,139
Bucket. Oh this is okay. That's right. The okay. All right. All right

5563
04:08:42,379 --> 04:08:43,979
I see. I see. I see

5564
04:08:43,979 --> 04:08:47,100
We're not trying to kill the kids. Okay. All right. So now

5565
04:08:48,430 --> 04:08:54,590
What's in that room? Yeah. Anyways, this is like where whoever runs the house would sleep. I guess like nade shot or somebody

5566
04:08:55,309 --> 04:08:59,790
Um, this is the this is the playroom now. I know this looks bad, but

5567
04:09:00,430 --> 04:09:06,190
Kids will be kids boys will be boys. Sometimes things get roughed up. Okay, that's the we're at we're at it

5568
04:09:06,270 --> 04:09:09,790
We're you you your score is unfortunately falling

5569
04:09:10,270 --> 04:09:12,750
After that it's unfortunately falling

5570
04:09:14,670 --> 04:09:20,420
It's a lot of a lot of a lot of dings if the kids are happy then i'm happy and that's what matters

5571
04:09:20,500 --> 04:09:24,579
I don't even need the score. Anyways, this is the playroom. We have a lot of toys for the kids here

5572
04:09:25,139 --> 04:09:31,600
Okay, um, well you can actually hold them. Yeah, you throw it and like they fetch it and then they come back

5573
04:09:33,950 --> 04:09:35,950
This is like a little doll

5574
04:09:35,950 --> 04:09:37,950
I believe okay

5575
04:09:38,030 --> 04:09:41,549
There's some weaponry. There's some security cameras you have okay

5576
04:09:42,510 --> 04:09:49,219
Okay, so we have we have sponsors can I see the garage could I see the garage

5577
04:09:49,860 --> 04:09:57,579
In the interior of the garage here. We have another toy. We've got like an outlet with a fork. Jesus christ

5578
04:09:58,299 --> 04:10:00,159
okay, um

5579
04:10:00,159 --> 04:10:02,159
I I think of course I have

5580
04:10:02,959 --> 04:10:04,959
Your philosophy had to come down a little

5581
04:10:05,600 --> 04:10:11,459
First you have the garage it will get there. Okay, so I wanted to show you this we do like this is still here

5582
04:10:12,260 --> 04:10:14,260
Uh, why is it not clean?

5583
04:10:14,260 --> 04:10:16,340
But when the kids turn 14, that's where they go drink

5584
04:10:20,190 --> 04:10:24,670
Juvie, okay, what's in the garage? I gotta see the garage. Oh, yeah the garage

5585
04:10:25,329 --> 04:10:28,209
This is uh where we get streaming setups. So if they're gonna be in the orphanage

5586
04:10:28,290 --> 04:10:34,770
They want to become streamers obviously and is there anything in the garage? Of course. Oh

5587
04:10:35,579 --> 04:10:36,979
shit

5588
04:10:36,979 --> 04:10:39,950
Okay

5589
04:10:39,950 --> 04:10:46,670
You've actually got a garage. You have a garage setup. That's shocking your setup. All right, we can't we have face cams

5590
04:10:47,229 --> 04:10:53,409
And that does a nice face cams and it's been the perfect place to see somebody's face perfect lineup. She's on hundred thieves

5591
04:10:54,670 --> 04:10:58,670
Yeah, I thank congratulations for making a garage. First of all, that's uh, thank you, of course

5592
04:10:58,829 --> 04:11:04,510
And what what why would you not utilize the garage? That's what's the computer? It was silly. Is that just a regular computer?

5593
04:11:04,670 --> 04:11:07,149
That's a streaming computer. Okay, they're melee players

5594
04:11:07,709 --> 04:11:13,180
Okay, cool. Cool. Okay. All right. I think I think i've got your wait. Hold on. What's in the back?

5595
04:11:13,729 --> 04:11:15,809
You did paint the exterior which is actually a huge deal

5596
04:11:16,430 --> 04:11:21,409
Of course painting the exterior is a big deal. So we're gonna have chat get the grade up for you

5597
04:11:21,489 --> 04:11:23,729
They can uh do it. I can give you what I what I like

5598
04:11:24,049 --> 04:11:27,809
Let's not pretend like there's not an effort made on the lawn because like as you can see the turf here

5599
04:11:27,969 --> 04:11:33,280
The kids lay it out. They mow it they try so you didn't do that. No, the kids do it

5600
04:11:33,440 --> 04:11:37,979
Oh, okay. So you didn't do that. Uh, well, I mean it's done. It's a part of the

5601
04:11:38,540 --> 04:11:41,299
Okay. Yeah, that's fair

5602
04:11:42,780 --> 04:11:48,770
All right. What do we got? What do we got for a chat score? Uh a b c or d you can't go lower than a 60

5603
04:11:49,420 --> 04:11:54,059
Um, i'm not saying that for any particular reasons or anything. I'm just I just wanted to make sure I said it

5604
04:11:55,409 --> 04:11:57,649
All right. I got you 75 for creativity

5605
04:11:58,350 --> 04:12:02,350
Uh, I I do I do I think it's a solid c. I do like the idea

5606
04:12:02,829 --> 04:12:09,950
Of I love what gets what gets a 75 for creativity like over like what what did like the what did like the maze get?

5607
04:12:10,659 --> 04:12:15,700
Uh, you're talking about connor's maze. Yeah, like just like just like just so I have like a comparison

5608
04:12:16,260 --> 04:12:21,729
Connors maze got a also 75 for creativity. Okay. Well that all right. That's yeah

5609
04:12:22,450 --> 04:12:24,659
I would like you to open the front door

5610
04:12:24,659 --> 04:12:31,940
Uh in the front the reason why the 75 is for creativity is because this space although clean and although nicely, you know decorated

5611
04:12:32,579 --> 04:12:38,420
It the the creativity there's a kitchen there in the way the kitchen's supposed to be it's a nice home

5612
04:12:38,579 --> 04:12:42,500
It's a nice house. You made it's a nice interior. I love the idea that you've replicated

5613
04:12:42,979 --> 04:12:44,979
Uh this this uh, this home this house

5614
04:12:45,379 --> 04:12:48,739
It's I believe I believe that's a good but creatively speaking

5615
04:12:49,219 --> 04:12:52,739
I think I could have used a little bit more a little bit more paint on the walls

5616
04:12:52,739 --> 04:12:54,500
Maybe not maybe not so much red

5617
04:12:54,500 --> 04:12:59,680
Uh, and I I would say that 75 is a pretty fair score for creativity on complexity. Yeah, it's not bad

5618
04:12:59,760 --> 04:13:02,319
Can I try I mean I I would like to vouch for my

5619
04:13:02,799 --> 04:13:08,719
For my comrade here and give a couple more on creativity because I mean that is a courage jd sponsored kitchen

5620
04:13:08,799 --> 04:13:11,200
You know avengers assembled if you know, you know

5621
04:13:11,600 --> 04:13:17,040
Uh, it's it's an end thing. You may not know it is the yeah, I I think I'm not that familiar with 100 thieves

5622
04:13:17,680 --> 04:13:23,579
Come on now. Let's not be too hasty with this sponsorships. You know, I mean there's no hashtag ad anywhere. I don't know

5623
04:13:24,399 --> 04:13:28,959
I i've i've it's actually a good point. I'm not ever puts food on the table for the kids is what I always say

5624
04:13:29,120 --> 04:13:33,920
Like it wasn't wasn't one of the easy to get a sign. Apologies officer in playroom. I'll give you

5625
04:13:35,440 --> 04:13:42,420
I'll give you 76 complexity. I'm gonna I'm gonna give you 64 for complexity because your favorite operating system is the nintendo 64

5626
04:13:42,659 --> 04:13:47,090
I figured that that was a good thing to give you. I think that was your favorite you called it an operating system

5627
04:13:47,170 --> 04:13:53,649
Yeah, operating system. Yeah, no, that's my favorite. Probably that is probably right and I gave you I gave you a 60

5628
04:13:54,190 --> 04:14:00,559
Unfortunately, I gave you a 60 for cleanliness just because it's uh, the wall all the boards and it was fair

5629
04:14:01,120 --> 04:14:03,120
boys will be boys and like a

5630
04:14:03,280 --> 04:14:06,559
A lot of the these kids a lot of the walls were kind of missing pieces

5631
04:14:06,959 --> 04:14:10,399
Uh, there's still that notices on the front. It's it wasn't really cleaned up properly

5632
04:14:10,959 --> 04:14:15,920
Uh, but I really shows the state of our orphanages really that I mean, it's not really

5633
04:14:16,719 --> 04:14:19,600
That makes sense. That's fair. I mean i'm glad I can bring awareness to it

5634
04:14:20,000 --> 04:14:27,329
Chat has given you a b chat has given you an 85 chat's rate is an 85. I'll take b. I got you

5635
04:14:27,329 --> 04:14:32,770
I'm gonna give you a 78 on philosophy because I think I like I like the I like you you

5636
04:14:33,489 --> 04:14:37,569
You fulfilled your philosophy the whole place was built on this one theme

5637
04:14:38,049 --> 04:14:43,090
You didn't make you know, whatever the hundred thieves, you know front door and then have a completely different interior

5638
04:14:43,170 --> 04:14:48,159
You did stick with the theme and the philosophy. So i'm going to give you a c plus for that one and look we can get you

5639
04:14:58,319 --> 04:15:01,200
I'm gonna have to give you your final grade now your grade

5640
04:15:01,920 --> 04:15:07,700
Is as of right now you got a 76 for creativity. I've got you at a 64

5641
04:15:08,260 --> 04:15:12,079
For complexity and structure i've got you at 60

5642
04:15:12,959 --> 04:15:21,600
I'm gonna give you 64 for cleanliness because it's also you know might as well because it's 64. It's your favorite console. That's fair

5643
04:15:22,239 --> 04:15:25,600
That makes sense. I'm gonna give you 78 for philosophy

5644
04:15:26,239 --> 04:15:31,590
And then an 85 for chat's grade which gets you to a grand total of 72.4

5645
04:15:33,920 --> 04:15:37,600
You got a that's a full on see that that is more than passing. That's very well

5646
04:15:37,680 --> 04:15:46,120
Is that higher or lower than the other connor, uh, the other connor got a 75.6 robbed that's fine

5647
04:15:46,840 --> 04:15:49,139
That's okay

5648
04:15:49,139 --> 04:15:53,780
I'm a winner in my heart. We're last place together. We're last place. There is no last. Okay

5649
04:15:54,899 --> 04:15:59,219
Very important very important when you're in school in high school ed in college

5650
04:15:59,379 --> 04:16:01,459
They don't like bring everybody up and say all right

5651
04:16:01,459 --> 04:16:05,940
Hey, this is the best people in the actually they do it's like the fucking dean's list. They do right

5652
04:16:06,020 --> 04:16:06,739
They do do that

5653
04:16:06,739 --> 04:16:12,260
Yeah, but they also used to say like 10 people got d's five people got c's and they would say in front of the whole

5654
04:16:12,420 --> 04:16:15,879
Class and then they'd slap a paper in front. He was actually traumatizing

5655
04:16:16,899 --> 04:16:22,790
This is kind of like that jerma in a way. You've done this to us. How about you show us your house jerma?

5656
04:16:23,510 --> 04:16:26,790
What do you have to offer? I was walking around just putting random paint on walls

5657
04:16:26,790 --> 04:16:28,629
I was answering technical support

5658
04:16:28,629 --> 04:16:31,989
We all had the same amount of time and you made a house and you've played this game more than us

5659
04:16:31,989 --> 04:16:35,909
Like what's what's what's your house? What makes it so you can grade? What's the philosophy?

5660
04:16:35,909 --> 04:16:38,340
You can grade my house

5661
04:16:39,700 --> 04:16:42,500
Let me get let me give the grade let me give the final grades up

5662
04:16:42,739 --> 04:16:47,379
We need to know what your your qualifications are my qualifications and even get yeah

5663
04:16:48,420 --> 04:16:50,659
Connery spans your overall grade was a 72.4

5664
04:16:51,360 --> 04:16:57,829
Let's get the final grades on here because I think people need to see them and we're going to do it in

5667
04:17:07,909 --> 04:17:11,510
How do we do this without it being big I bet you feel big

5668
04:17:13,889 --> 04:17:16,709
All right, here we go with a

5669
04:17:19,250 --> 04:17:22,200

You know

5679
04:18:03,520 --> 04:18:06,479
There's also an a you remember teachers wouldn't round up. Oh

5680
04:18:07,280 --> 04:18:11,860
Well, we I mean we could round up but these are the exact scores with

5681
04:18:13,200 --> 04:18:15,700

5689
04:19:13,379 --> 04:19:16,479
87 and above b-plus. That's correct with

5690
04:19:18,379 --> 04:19:25,059
87.5 we have poke. Yes, 87.5

5691
04:19:25,680 --> 04:19:29,780
You guys were neck and neck yours was fucking hilarious. This is great

5692
04:19:30,420 --> 04:19:36,690
Great, thank you. Wait, can I take that one percent he gave me or no? Oh, that's right. Hold on. Wait, wait

5693
04:19:36,690 --> 04:19:39,250
Wait, you you you did offer the friend the friend points

5694
04:19:40,479 --> 04:19:47,440
How are we gonna do that? I think he loses one and poke gets one right? Joel. What's your uh, what's your uh assessment here?

5695
04:19:47,840 --> 04:19:54,450
Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do? Well, sorry what you said you wanted you wanted to give zero point something points to friend points

5696
04:19:54,850 --> 04:19:58,579
Okay, how about this? How about this? Uh, I will give

5697
04:19:59,059 --> 04:20:04,479
As very generous and I just want to say, you know, thanks. Thank you that I can be part of this

5698
04:20:04,719 --> 04:20:07,920
I just want to say this I think poke gets a zero

5699
04:20:08,620 --> 04:20:15,790
0.5 extra friend point zero point five. So that would be no no change at all

5700
04:20:17,469 --> 04:20:19,469
I'll take it. I'll take it

5701
04:20:20,750 --> 04:20:22,750
And 87.55

5702
04:20:22,829 --> 04:20:24,190
Changing points

5703
04:20:24,190 --> 04:20:28,750
In second place if anyone below me wants to combine our scores to take first place as a tie

5704
04:20:28,829 --> 04:20:30,030
I think i'm open to that too

5705
04:20:30,030 --> 04:20:36,750
I'd like to give all my points to connor eats pants into help his orphanage because I believe thank you in helping the youth

5706
04:20:36,750 --> 04:20:42,909

5711
04:21:00,829 --> 04:21:04,590
What if we were to rate germa's house all of us? No, that's what we're doing

5712
04:21:04,670 --> 04:21:07,870
Yeah, but I didn't even I wasn't competing. I was like literally walking in circles

5713
04:21:09,469 --> 04:21:11,229
Did you have 75 minutes to make it?

5714
04:21:11,229 --> 04:21:15,469
I had 75 minutes to explain to chat how this process was going and answering questions

5715
04:21:15,629 --> 04:21:18,590
How many hours do you have on you? You have more hours on this game than all this combined

5716
04:21:18,590 --> 04:21:24,620
I have two or three thousand hours in this game. I would I would demolish any of you in a challenge any of you

04:21:24,620 --> 04:21:29,180
Let's find out we'll find out when we look at your house right now any of you so get through these get through these scores

5723
04:21:53,010 --> 04:21:54,209
Uh

5724
04:21:54,209 --> 04:21:57,739
Yeah more of a I feel like just my history lessons aren't appreciated. So

5725
04:21:58,510 --> 04:22:03,309
All right, we got your chat gbt history lessons. I mean lugwig you're lugwig. You're a red devil in the white city

5726
04:22:03,389 --> 04:22:05,950
I was an english major. What do you want from me?

5727
04:22:06,750 --> 04:22:09,469
As well, I forget that sometimes yeah, I went to college

5728
04:22:10,770 --> 04:22:15,969
English major gang love your score. Your score is like good. You had an 83.2. Ludwig. That's a b

5729
04:22:16,209 --> 04:22:22,129
I know I had the worst chapel though, and it really hurt it did it was 10 percent. They were so mean

5730
04:22:22,450 --> 04:22:26,850
Yeah, they hate you. Yeah, they hated me justice of this entire day is luther getting

5731
04:22:28,290 --> 04:22:31,809
Injustice you brit. All right, we have

5732
04:22:35,260 --> 04:22:40,139
Hold on hold on. Let me see. We got 83.2 is lugwig. You had a drinking corner for 14 year olds

5733
04:22:41,899 --> 04:22:43,899
That's true

5734
04:22:45,180 --> 04:22:51,420
You lose you lose quite a few philosophy points with the 14 year old drinking corner. I think that that's I think that's fair

5735
04:22:51,819 --> 04:22:53,819
Okay, we got uh

5736
04:22:59,420 --> 04:23:01,420
Yeah, doug did use a

5737
04:23:02,700 --> 04:23:09,020
Doug's maze room was a real maze. It wasn't just walls put up in random locations down gigantic

5738
04:23:09,020 --> 04:23:12,940
Always maze is a generous term to describe. What was at the end of that?

5739
04:23:15,229 --> 04:23:21,299
Uh, who's next after lugwig? All right. Now we've got we're down now. We're down to the seas. We have 78

5740
04:23:22,260 --> 04:23:27,059
Seven and this is not a bad thing. We got 70. It's no it's not it's not criken

5741
04:23:27,059 --> 04:23:31,329
We got you to 78.45. That's a c plus

5742
04:23:32,180 --> 04:23:35,299
That's good. And he's get degrees sees get to read degrees real shit

5743
04:23:35,379 --> 04:23:41,899
And no and remember remember philosophy wise remember we saw what happened when somebody went full-blown barbie husk. Oh, yeah, they won

5744
04:23:42,299 --> 04:23:44,610
That's true. I mean you

5745
04:23:44,690 --> 04:23:50,940
Your philosophy you you were there and I blew it these guys you were there. I was there

5747
04:23:55,420 --> 04:24:00,959
Vinnie was Vinnie's at eighty three point eight. So he is higher than you lugwig. I'm sorry

5748
04:24:01,520 --> 04:24:04,510
Oh

5749
04:24:04,510 --> 04:24:10,110
Yeah, he's got it. He's really good. It was Vinnie's was really good. Yeah, both of ours were good. We're both

5750
04:24:10,989 --> 04:24:12,510
Yeah

5751
04:24:12,510 --> 04:24:14,110
so now we've got

5752
04:24:14,110 --> 04:24:16,350
Underneath you criken we have with a

5753
04:24:17,409 --> 04:24:22,639
With a seventy five point six we have c dog. Thank you

5754
04:24:23,840 --> 04:24:25,840
This was awesome

5755
04:24:26,799 --> 04:24:29,760
It was like a powerpoint presentation of like memes

5756
04:24:31,280 --> 04:24:32,879
It really was

5757
04:24:32,879 --> 04:24:37,520
Honestly, it was just you went through your computer and just typed in you typed into the windows search bar

5758
04:24:38,000 --> 04:24:42,159
Dot png and was just like what do I got on my computer right now?

5759
04:24:42,399 --> 04:24:47,920
Your house is what elon musk wanted to live in when he bought twitter just memes just comedy was legal again

5760
04:24:48,479 --> 04:24:53,360
I you know, I think I went the extra mile with the decoration and the sheer amount of walls

5761
04:24:53,600 --> 04:24:55,280
Um, it was just it was tough

5762
04:24:55,280 --> 04:24:57,280
I was I was it was a lot of walls

5763
04:24:57,760 --> 04:25:01,920
It was it was a lot of walls good maze. It's a lot too much walls

5764
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:06,319
I think I by the time I realized I had 10 minutes left. I was like, oh i've got i've got nothing

5765
04:25:07,200 --> 04:25:10,799
They were all mustard colored, too. You had like a whole mustard colored house

5766
04:25:11,420 --> 04:25:17,979
Oh, it was I loved it. I loved it. I imagine summer. It's just unbearably hot because the air can't reach you

5767
04:25:18,459 --> 04:25:21,899
Oh my god, I don't there's no reason to be there anyway

5768
04:25:26,219 --> 04:25:27,420
In the house

5769
04:25:27,420 --> 04:25:34,379
It's on like the real estate listing. There's no reason and then a 73.4 which is a 72 a c still it is right

5770
04:25:34,620 --> 04:25:36,540
Or is it c minus?

5771
04:25:36,540 --> 04:25:41,059
Uh c minus that's connery's pants at a 72.4

5772
04:25:44,819 --> 04:25:49,620
Yeah, it's uh, oh c minus wait all all the c's got c's that's actually yeah

5773
04:25:50,180 --> 04:25:56,500
That's kind of thematic there. There are your final grades. That's a 1.667 gpa, right? Did I literally get last place?

5774
04:25:58,989 --> 04:26:04,290
Oh, yeah, you got dead last there is no last place. There's no last place. There's objectively

5775
04:26:10,379 --> 04:26:12,379
Corners were voted last. I feel like there's

5776
04:26:14,059 --> 04:26:19,819
Everybody with c to start their name off. Hmm all got c's. Wow. What's up with that? Huh?

5777
04:26:21,100 --> 04:26:24,219
Hey, you guys had your philosophy scores were high with okay

5778
04:26:24,540 --> 04:26:27,260
Some would say we never stood a chance philosophy scores

5779
04:26:27,979 --> 04:26:30,700
Your philosophy scores are my put your dog in the game

5780
04:26:31,260 --> 04:26:34,739
You do show us your house. Give me a second

I wasn't competing

5784
04:26:51,469 --> 04:26:55,950
Well, we're still gonna judge you on a few factors guys. What do you think for the factors? We should judge them on

5785
04:26:56,030 --> 04:26:58,030
Yeah, what what factors do you want to judge me?

5786
04:26:58,270 --> 04:27:04,510
It's the same criteria, I think that's okay. Okay, asshole. Okay. Okay. Sure great this one

5795
04:27:45,680 --> 04:27:47,200

04:27:49,579 --> 04:27:51,280
Okay

5798
04:27:51,280 --> 04:27:55,840
Um, I think you got the wrong save. Can we go ahead and see that garage before you head out? Where the fuck is my house?

5799
04:27:56,159 --> 04:28:00,000
You sleep. What are you loading here? Jeremy? Can you go back to the home, please? Where's my where's it?

5800
04:28:00,780 --> 04:28:06,700
What about that garden after building the where's the crusty crab? The crusty crab was here. Where's the crusty crab?

5801
04:28:06,780 --> 04:28:11,979
What sure are you okay? Jeremy? What are you talking about? Honest to god? Why why is the crusty crab not here?

5802

I swear to god it was here at like fucking 40 minutes ago. All right, you gotta be shitting me

5803
04:28:20,670 --> 04:28:25,069
Where's the crusty crust around jerma? You wouldn't mind. Uh, we got a zero for preparation

5804
04:28:26,430 --> 04:28:29,629
Yeah, the fact that this doesn't exist is good doc complexity

5805
04:28:29,950 --> 04:28:35,549
It is we are gonna add complexity. I think because he's made it up in his own head and oh, this is fucked up

5806
04:28:35,790 --> 04:28:41,469
This is actually fucked up. Where's the crusty crab? It's more philosophical. I sold it. Yeah, that is philosophical. I sold it

5807
04:28:41,790 --> 04:28:45,600
It's the cabin. No, it's not it's not

5808
04:28:49,250 --> 04:28:55,059
It would be the crusty crab it wouldn't be the cabin that's a mess right there what yeah, that's fucking awful

5809
04:28:56,340 --> 04:29:02,399
Love 60 for cleanliness, right guys. That is the lowest score of course the lowest possible score. Yeah, there's a bit back

5810
04:29:04,530 --> 04:29:10,540
Hold on the presentation on the class computer jerma, you should oh did you just have a 180 in your opinions?

5811
04:29:10,540 --> 04:29:13,360
I think you just did oh it just guys

5812
04:29:14,000 --> 04:29:16,000
It got silent

5813
04:29:18,079 --> 04:29:24,159
This is the wrong building am I am I wrong to say that i'm clipping through the roof. Why don't we take you through?

5814
04:29:24,319 --> 04:29:26,319
What's this? Oh

5815
04:29:26,319 --> 04:29:28,319
25 minutes. Yeah

5816
04:29:29,120 --> 04:29:32,159
It's this go ahead build away build away crusty crab

5817
04:29:32,239 --> 04:29:36,959
That looks pretty interesting doesn't it through the front door as you see this house is perfectly this sign is in the perfect location

5818
04:29:37,440 --> 04:29:44,579
Going through here. We've got the galley grub. There is your ordering station squidward sits right here

5819
04:29:45,200 --> 04:29:50,100
Unbelievably complex complexity philosophy theming idea of the bathtub being the thing that he sits behind

5820
04:29:51,420 --> 04:29:56,270
This is don't worry about this. This is uh, there's nothing you have to worry about that

5821
04:29:56,750 --> 04:30:00,319
Uh, this is uh, hold on

5822
04:30:00,639 --> 04:30:03,280
Why there's a futuristic space just wait just wait just wait just wait

5823
04:30:04,000 --> 04:30:06,159
Go look at what the crusty crab looks like it looks like this

5824
04:30:08,719 --> 04:30:11,760
No, it is pretty accurate to the crusty crab. I'll give you that. Oh

5825
04:30:12,559 --> 04:30:15,680
Crusty crab. This is where spongebob. This is the window in the corner

5826
04:30:16,239 --> 04:30:19,979
Well, you're the kitchen's pretty good. What's that connor said that again?

5827
04:30:21,420 --> 04:30:23,420
Okay, I don't know connor. I'm not seeing any mazes

5828
04:30:24,139 --> 04:30:29,739
Yeah, where did the kids sleep? Where did the orphans go? Yeah, where where's where's the where's like that weird?

5829
04:30:30,139 --> 04:30:34,260
Corner. Yeah, the weird corner. Yeah

5830
04:30:35,059 --> 04:30:38,260
That gave me. Oh, did you have working lights only three of you did?

5831
04:30:38,940 --> 04:30:42,139
Can you show us the uh, could you show us mr. Krabs's room again?

5832
04:30:43,299 --> 04:30:49,040
Uh, this is the bathroom. We don't need it. I said I I I was I got tired when I did this

5833
04:30:49,600 --> 04:30:51,600
And I was like I have to go tired

5834
04:30:51,600 --> 04:30:56,479
But it's always hard to make crusty crabs office. It was hard to do it because they forgot the freezer

5835
04:30:57,120 --> 04:31:02,940
Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, but that side door always be in the kitchen. Like I don't remember that in the manga

5836
04:31:02,940 --> 04:31:04,379
I'll be honest with you

5837
04:31:04,379 --> 04:31:09,620
This is up here. If you didn't know up in the car. What is up here? Oh, what?

5838
04:31:10,020 --> 04:31:18,479
How did you remove the stairs? What the fuck is this? This is a different base home. Oh

5839
04:31:18,879 --> 04:31:22,799
Uh, yeah, some of the houses you can remove the stairs some of them were made more way more customizable than others

5840
04:31:25,600 --> 04:31:31,280
Mr. Krabs goes into hiding. Yeah, the irs is after him and this was you made this in 45 minutes

5841
04:31:31,360 --> 04:31:33,360
Somebody hacked my computer and did this part

5842
04:31:33,760 --> 04:31:39,340
House looks like a gmod man on ttt. Can you go through the those doors? Yeah. Wait, what what is going on?

5843
04:31:39,420 --> 04:31:41,420
Oh, this is somebody hacked my computer into this

5844
04:31:45,489 --> 04:31:51,329
And yes, I did I I I did this in 45 minutes with uh shows the outside

5845
04:31:51,729 --> 04:31:56,180
Yes, you make a vampire shrine to yourself. Yeah fucking weird. I know

5846
04:31:56,819 --> 04:31:58,819
I wish I was a vampire too

5847
04:31:59,219 --> 04:32:02,340
I what's the idea behind the the weeds in the straw because

5848
04:32:02,739 --> 04:32:06,579
The house flipper actually grows grass and I haven't been in this house for like four months

5849
04:32:08,110 --> 04:32:11,469
What's the what's the deal with that balcony on the side of the house? Can you look at that again?

5850
04:32:11,549 --> 04:32:15,969
Which one left side of the crusty crab? Oh, um

5851
04:32:16,530 --> 04:32:20,690
So what's going on there? Well, you can I'll figure it out. I could figure a question doug

5852
04:32:20,850 --> 04:32:24,930
By the way, where are all the animals because they were like, where's the maze?

5853
04:32:25,969 --> 04:32:29,250
Oh, and you didn't even say anything about my oh, it's nothing's here. There was like a bunch of problems

5854
04:32:30,940 --> 04:32:32,219
No maze. Okay

5855
04:32:32,219 --> 04:32:36,059
Uh, where are the animals? They were like 15 animals that were like running around

5856
04:32:37,899 --> 04:32:42,620
Well, they gotta make the burger somehow. So did you remember to plan this whole tournament so you could show us this house

5857
04:32:45,260 --> 04:32:50,860
Can you can you a really really cool shot above that that gray thing in the back to see what's back there

5858
04:32:51,440 --> 04:32:55,760
Okay, you want you want me to just go up and take a look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah if you could you got it

5859
04:32:55,840 --> 04:33:02,959
Are you for grappling hook? Yeah, there's a great. I'll do wait. Oh, you mean back here?

5860
04:33:03,620 --> 04:33:07,099
Yeah, there's like a trap door or something. Oh, that is weird. What is that?

5861
04:33:07,500 --> 04:33:16,209
Oh, what's going on here? That should be illegal

5862
04:33:17,569 --> 04:33:24,130
That I didn't put that there. I don't like that. I didn't put that there you want someone to climb down from the ceiling all your table

5863
04:33:24,130 --> 04:33:30,990
I don't think I put that there. I'm comfortable. Uh, we're gonna take points off for cleanliness. It's gonna be a plus in complexity minus in philosophy

5864
04:33:31,069 --> 04:33:37,439
All right, what's my grade the smell so bad? You have to escape through the hatch. I mean honestly, I thought

5865
04:33:38,580 --> 04:33:41,380
You guys want to go ahead first? Well, what do you guys think for creativity?

5866
04:33:41,779 --> 04:33:45,380
Creativity, it's definitely got to be high, you know, it's pretty high. I thought at least

5867
04:33:46,740 --> 04:33:48,619
Yeah, I think that's fair

5868
04:33:48,619 --> 04:33:55,340
I one thing that bothered me is that the sign wasn't on its own post because that to me is the defining feature the crusty crab

5869
04:33:55,819 --> 04:34:00,220
Is its own definitive sign and he just he just left it on the front like a like a like a

5870
04:34:00,930 --> 04:34:06,369
Like he doesn't have the mcdonald's arches game limitation. It's not even transparent. It's just a you know, like a white

5871
04:34:06,450 --> 04:34:08,049
Yeah, just png

5872
04:34:08,049 --> 04:34:13,970
Wait, jk to the you know plankton's home nearby. So it's really geographically vague where we are

5873
04:34:14,369 --> 04:34:16,369
Yeah, that's right. You're right

5874
04:34:18,290 --> 04:34:20,450
90 creativity on like established ip

5875
04:34:21,569 --> 04:34:27,169
Well, how much time did germa have on this house 45 minutes five plus about three and a half hours

5876
04:34:27,490 --> 04:34:29,069
You've clocked in like

5877
04:34:29,069 --> 04:34:30,930
65 000 hours

5878
04:34:30,930 --> 04:34:32,849
I I have barely played this game

5879
04:34:32,930 --> 04:34:35,970
All right, and i'm trying to get extra points here at them and i'm just saying

5880
04:34:36,369 --> 04:34:41,729
With the amount of time you you know from this game. You should have been able to shit out of mona lisa in no time

5881
04:34:42,290 --> 04:34:48,770
But no gary no spongebob. No nosferatu. You're not gonna make it in hollywood. No, it's brought to excuse me

5882
04:34:49,409 --> 04:34:51,409
That's a good point. No nosferatu

5883
04:34:51,490 --> 04:34:56,049
He did make the whole vampire. He does have a nose for us. Yeah, he did actually have a vampire room in fairness

5884
04:34:56,130 --> 04:35:00,130
Yeah, come on. Yeah, and so I in fact, let's let's touch on that for a moment

5885
04:35:00,529 --> 04:35:04,770
I thought because of the vampire room for me philosophy was the highest score. I put 95

5886
04:35:05,970 --> 04:35:07,569
Well now on philosophy

5887
04:35:07,569 --> 04:35:13,330
I don't know just because of that hatch to access the toilet because like what have you just taken a shit and someone like

5888
04:35:13,409 --> 04:35:18,529
Climbs down from the ceiling like what I know. Yeah, I put 60 that's some weird philosophy. I don't know

5889
04:35:19,810 --> 04:35:21,330
I do have work

5890
04:35:21,729 --> 04:35:25,169
You may be able to take a shit on the roof and have it drop down into the toilet though

5891
04:35:25,569 --> 04:35:31,729
Nah, the angle makes that impossible to be frank, but the detail detail not with my kind of firepower the detail though

5892
04:35:37,090 --> 04:35:41,490
No, but that's that's not that's that's nothing go look at the interior of crusty crab

5893
04:35:44,290 --> 04:35:47,889
Look at how the wood falls. Why is there a trough for cows?

5894
04:35:50,130 --> 04:35:53,490
They were like 10 barn animals that lived here and I don't know where they are

5895
04:35:53,650 --> 04:35:58,689
I don't know where they went. They're actually supposed to be lost barn animals minus

5896
04:35:59,810 --> 04:36:01,810
I think they're dead

5897
04:36:02,130 --> 04:36:04,189
I don't know what happened to the animals

5898
04:36:04,189 --> 04:36:10,110
Yeah, while we're doing the grade and I I think the mods are sharing that chat's vote has come in with an f unfortunately

5899
04:36:10,509 --> 04:36:12,509
That's both. No, that's bullshit. That's

5900
04:36:14,349 --> 04:36:16,990
Deserve an f but it is the majority of the votes

5901
04:36:21,150 --> 04:36:23,389
Okay, so that's 60 that's so let me do okay fine

5902
04:36:24,909 --> 04:36:30,990
Creativity, what do you got for me creativity? I think 90 a 90. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's established ip though

5903
04:36:31,810 --> 04:36:35,970
But barbie house, we gave a high but it's fine. That's fine. Okay. It's fine. Oh, okay

5904
04:36:37,090 --> 04:36:39,090
For an hundred thieves orphanage

5905
04:36:43,569 --> 04:36:50,450
Complexity I think I think um, it was there's some like cool elements like the door the sliding doors

5906
04:36:51,250 --> 04:36:54,909
Um, like even like the posters I think they're kind of cool

5907
04:36:55,840 --> 04:36:59,360
Uh, hey, but but if you open up look at the interior of the crusty crab

5908
04:36:59,919 --> 04:37:04,380
You wouldn't have put these here lugwig the troughs. Yeah. No, no, no

5909
04:37:05,419 --> 04:37:09,819
I'm talking about this these pillars with the trap door to the bathroom so that perverts can enter

5910
04:37:09,900 --> 04:37:12,939
Yeah, between it's either between the I don't think you would have done this

5911
04:37:12,939 --> 04:37:18,060
I don't think I think you would have just kept the tables as they were you told us specifically just now to look up images

5912
04:37:18,060 --> 04:37:24,619
Of the interior so I did uh, and they're all rectangular like the interior of the crusty crab is one big rectangle

5913
04:37:25,900 --> 04:37:32,349
That's true. You know, let's go with maybe 85 for complexity. Yeah, I think I honestly

5914
04:37:36,430 --> 04:37:42,909
70 what I think 70 you're just on the trap door that went up to the the room was kind of cool

5915
04:37:44,779 --> 04:37:48,139
And the beams were are nice until you realize it's just empty space

5916
04:37:50,459 --> 04:37:52,939
How about an 80 how about an 80 I can do it

5917
04:37:53,819 --> 04:38:00,700
Yeah, but we should divide the score by how much time was spent making the item 45 minutes plus four hours hours

5918
04:38:01,340 --> 04:38:05,259
Well, I think chad's vote went into account that because they gave him an f. I know I think I think

5919
04:38:06,299 --> 04:38:10,720
Yeah, sergeant go ahead. Okay. Yeah, I took longer doing this but I wasn't timed

5920
04:38:11,139 --> 04:38:14,659
I sat around we we watched like three or four youtube videos

5921
04:38:14,979 --> 04:38:16,819
We went off on like a food tangent

5922
04:38:16,819 --> 04:38:19,939
There was like at least two or three hours of that stream where I wasn't even playing house flipper

5923
04:38:20,419 --> 04:38:26,720
Little baby said what I could repeat it. So what what uh, what happened was I was watching videos

5924
04:38:26,799 --> 04:38:28,479
I was watching like three or four videos

5925
04:38:28,479 --> 04:38:32,240
And then we did like a whole nother thing that we were talking about food and stuff

5926
04:38:32,400 --> 04:38:35,540
Did you hear me that time? No, I heard you that time a lot. I'm clear

5927
04:38:35,619 --> 04:38:41,619
Okay, I think uh, I appreciate that the the one thing that we're gonna talk about deeply is cleanliness

5928
04:38:42,959 --> 04:38:49,680
Yeah, yeah, and how troll? Oh, yeah, the trough was for the animals that we I put this in the last second

5929
04:38:49,759 --> 04:38:51,759
60

5930
04:38:54,080 --> 04:39:00,240
What is dirty here every look at how everything is perfectly clean you made it you made a restaurant with a trough inside

5931
04:39:00,319 --> 04:39:02,319
I can put my hand on the wall damn scores

5932
04:39:02,740 --> 04:39:07,700
Look at this even the bathroom the bathroom is immaculate. Look at every single one of it and no shits in here

5933
04:39:07,860 --> 04:39:11,860
No piss buckets in here. These are all clean. I think it's not clean though

5934
04:39:11,939 --> 04:39:15,779
The fact that you're shitting in an open everyone you're shitting next to someone. There's no there's no look

5935
04:39:15,939 --> 04:39:18,020
You got a ventilation system here ventilation

5936
04:39:18,979 --> 04:39:24,419
Why are the toilet stalls that's not why isn't there any doors on yeah, why that's not clean at all because you can't put them

5937
04:39:25,169 --> 04:39:28,930
I I feel like it might show my eyes if some of the lower score makes this call

5938
04:39:29,169 --> 04:39:32,529
Rt, what do you think for cleanliness? Because you had the highest score

5939
04:39:32,930 --> 04:39:39,810
I'm just trying to i'm trying to think of in relation to the spongebob lore and the crusty crab actually is notoriously not clean

5940
04:39:39,889 --> 04:39:40,369
And mr

5941
04:39:40,369 --> 04:39:41,729
crabs is like

5942
04:39:41,729 --> 04:39:46,369
Deploying all kinds of techniques to just keep it vaguely afloat when it's filthy

5943
04:39:46,529 --> 04:39:50,610
It was even an episode about the actual germs and the establishment if anything

5944
04:39:51,009 --> 04:39:55,409
I think the lore should be taken into account in judging that i'm on board with that

5945
04:39:55,490 --> 04:40:01,090
But there's he just knows the trunks wait the lord didn't apply in the grading though because like mine was a messy orphanage

5946
04:40:01,090 --> 04:40:04,209
But it was not messy. That is true in the hundred thieves juvie

5947
04:40:04,750 --> 04:40:11,979
Orphanage would be messy. Yeah, and it also wasn't creative. Oh, but did you have fred in your playthrough? Oh, he's so cute

5948
04:40:16,779 --> 04:40:18,779
All right

5949
04:40:19,520 --> 04:40:22,080
Let's get a grade. Let's get a grade

5950
04:40:22,080 --> 04:40:25,759
Can our can our favorite spongebob character can our a grades all give us a cleanliness score?

5951
04:40:25,759 --> 04:40:30,000
Whoever got an a can you give out a score for cleanliness and we'll find an average zero

5952
04:40:30,400 --> 04:40:36,909
If you're connor, you're obviously a c grade. Thank you very much salty because I gave his maze mustard house of 76

5953
04:40:39,439 --> 04:40:42,000
I'm salty because I got worse than the maze mustard

5954
04:40:42,799 --> 04:40:47,919
That's true. Honestly, honestly after the night after the night and i'm all this drama in this community and this

5955
04:40:48,479 --> 04:40:52,720
You know cataclysm that has happened the only reasonable thing I can see happening from now on

5956
04:40:53,200 --> 04:40:59,680
Is if jerma individually goes through every person and pretends they are the winner and congratulant you won first place

5957
04:40:59,759 --> 04:41:05,919
So we all get validation from this so we can pretend and feel good. Maybe just a dm that I can screenshot

5958
04:41:06,159 --> 04:41:10,479
Yeah, I will dm everybody saying you did a great job

5959
04:41:11,389 --> 04:41:14,349
But ain't nothing better than the crusty crap that will be in

5960
04:41:15,310 --> 04:41:20,349
Well, and you can you can you can crop it you can crop that message and frame it on the wall

5961
04:41:20,430 --> 04:41:24,509
Based on that alone i'm leaning towards giving you uh, you know all the connor's got a c grade

5962
04:41:24,590 --> 04:41:28,189
I think maybe you deserve a j grade too below them. Yeah

5963
04:41:29,869 --> 04:41:32,909
All right, so what am I what am I getting for complexity for real?

5964
04:41:33,759 --> 04:41:39,840
Uh complexity was 80 80 creativity was 90. Okay, so now philosophy is your highest score

5965
04:41:40,610 --> 04:41:42,909
Okay, so what would you say is that is?

5966
04:41:43,069 --> 04:41:49,500
91 are you all agreeing on that? No, did we talk about the alien doors clipping through the wall or no?

5967
04:41:49,819 --> 04:41:52,220
Uh, we didn't grab it up. Yeah

5968
04:41:53,900 --> 04:41:57,819
Can you guys show the doors like look open the door and look at it clip guys like what are we doing here?

5969
04:41:58,380 --> 04:41:59,819
What are we doing here?

5970
04:41:59,819 --> 04:42:03,580
Actually, you know so go in the bathroom go in the bathroom and look at the alien door and go up

5971
04:42:03,659 --> 04:42:04,939
What is that there?

5972
04:42:04,939 --> 04:42:09,180
I mean like look up above the alien like it's events ventilation. It's a ventilation event

5973
04:42:09,599 --> 04:42:12,799
I don't want to start more drama in the community, but like this is really pissing me off

5974
04:42:13,439 --> 04:42:14,880
Oh

5975
04:42:14,880 --> 04:42:19,599
Said it needed to be said I have a monumental point on cleanliness. Here's a please wash your hand sign

5976
04:42:19,680 --> 04:42:23,439
There is no sinks in that toilet. There's only toilet bowls. Where are you gonna wash your hands?

5977
04:42:24,080 --> 04:42:27,709
I mean, they're in the water though. What about in here?

5978
04:42:27,790 --> 04:42:30,909
We're just coming to you. You can come in here like dip your hands in there

5979
04:42:30,990 --> 04:42:33,950
Is there any indication that the water is here? Like how do we look?

5980
04:42:34,509 --> 04:42:37,069
See and did you have teleportation powers in your house?

5981
04:42:39,310 --> 04:42:42,509
I think that gets at least I you didn't even know I had that okay

5982
04:42:43,150 --> 04:42:48,560
Wow, i'm picking up philosophy to 93 for that. I didn't even go in the teleporting pool

5983
04:42:48,880 --> 04:42:55,779
And that's why this is our final call whatever we have for that then we can get our grade gonna say 90

5984
04:42:56,740 --> 04:42:58,979
Chat gave me a 60. Okay

5985
04:42:58,979 --> 04:43:03,060
Philosophy and matt what I said 90 we have our we have our final scores then okay

5986
04:43:03,060 --> 04:43:10,270
So what do you want to do the calculation creativity 90? Okay complexity 80. Okay philosophy

5987
04:43:11,610 --> 04:43:14,360
93 93

5988
04:43:14,360 --> 04:43:21,869
Cleanliness 60 90 flat 90 flat cleanliness. Are we are you guys agreeing on that? That's what doug said

5989
04:43:22,029 --> 04:43:28,080
I mean i'm down to lower it. I think it's fair 88 go for it. 88. Is that fair? I can do 88

5990
04:43:28,159 --> 04:43:32,080
I can do 88. Okay, there is no check raid check raid 60. All right, so

5991
04:43:32,639 --> 04:43:39,290
Uh, that puts me at an 84.65. Yeah, I just I guess

5992
04:43:41,770 --> 04:43:46,409
Let me just let me just like sneak my way in here real quick. Oh, sorry dropped your cleanliness to 80 flat

5993
04:43:47,130 --> 04:43:49,130
80 where where am I sit here? Oh

5994
04:43:50,569 --> 04:43:53,770
Right above any right below poke. Honestly, that's pretty fair

5995
04:43:54,939 --> 04:43:56,919
Yeah, middle of the pack

5996
04:43:56,919 --> 04:44:02,139
84.65 that looks all right to me. You're doing an exam and the teacher just takes at the end

5997
04:44:02,220 --> 04:44:04,220
It's like I just better than you

5998
04:44:04,779 --> 04:44:09,259
Yeah, what about my dad still didn't still didn't even do like top five

5999
04:44:10,299 --> 04:44:13,020
That's right. The teacher didn't even get top five

6000
04:44:13,180 --> 04:44:14,619
Oh

6001
04:44:14,619 --> 04:44:18,250
How the hell did you do it so good? Tell me there you're fine

6002
04:44:19,849 --> 04:44:24,810
Well, hey jerma, you know, congratulations. You look like you have some potential in this game. So I would keep at it

6003
04:44:26,409 --> 04:44:29,369
Yeah, that was a lot of fun. Did you guys have a good was that did you guys have a good time?

6004
04:44:30,490 --> 04:44:34,009
I don't know how you guys did what you did in 75 minutes. You guys are amazing

6005
04:44:34,759 --> 04:44:39,720
Yeah, everyone was creative for like their own their own way, you know, that was really awesome. I want to do it again

6006
04:44:40,279 --> 04:44:42,279
My only regrets I didn't get to go earlier

6007
04:44:42,759 --> 04:44:46,990
So I wouldn't have to go after the yeah, I wish I went earlier too

6008
04:44:50,349 --> 04:44:53,229
Do this again we do this again, but we're giving two hours

6009
04:44:54,110 --> 04:44:57,229
Yeah, we can do we could do a two hours

6010
04:44:57,950 --> 04:45:03,790
Hey house flipper two actually they don't have a release date, but you can build your you can build your actual whole house

6011
04:45:03,790 --> 04:45:09,069
I think from scratch in house number two. Oh my god. I also think it's strict a strict. Um

6012
04:45:10,200 --> 04:45:16,810
Like you should be graded on your performance there your what do you presentation like it should be strict five minutes

6013
04:45:16,889 --> 04:45:22,650
Can't go over can't go under get some songs in there. You know, I think that's part of it get some songs in there

6014
04:45:24,490 --> 04:45:25,610
Little music

6015
04:45:25,610 --> 04:45:30,650
Yeah, I just realized something I just realized something this whole thing was a gaslight by jerma

6016
04:45:30,889 --> 04:45:35,369
Because he just took a bunch of people in here to see how they viewed him through a scope

6017
04:45:35,689 --> 04:45:39,930
Like how do you view jerma and it turns out it's you know me

6018
04:45:40,810 --> 04:45:42,569
Just viewing him through memes

6019
04:45:42,569 --> 04:45:48,270
But other people are thinking like how do I skew it towards jerma through creativity or whatever, you know

6020
04:45:48,349 --> 04:45:51,549
and i'm just saying i'm just saying I think this was a

6021
04:45:52,569 --> 04:45:55,869
Experiment for jerma to do it. I don't know. They just feel I mean it was

6022
04:45:56,669 --> 04:45:58,669
It was this was an experiment

6023
04:45:58,909 --> 04:46:01,799
That that is absolutely correct. None of you won anything

6024
04:46:02,599 --> 04:46:08,840
And we're all going to go about our day normally as well. Yeah, then nobody 100 grand looking at this. Yeah the candy bar

6025
04:46:09,799 --> 04:46:13,479
I'll be waiting for the check in the mail the candy bar 100 grand scale right here

6026
04:46:13,880 --> 04:46:18,889
This is some ig in scoring for sure. You know, you should advertise it like 10 million dollars next time

6027
04:46:18,889 --> 04:46:22,889
But it's all inside joke. We don't talk about that. Do it for like five million dollars

6028
04:46:23,680 --> 04:46:29,819
Yeah, well, I honestly this was actually an experiment. Hope you guys had a good time. I thought it was great

6029
04:46:29,819 --> 04:46:35,659
I thought everyone had everyone had a lot of funny shit. Um, I thank you for organizing it

6030
04:46:36,139 --> 04:46:38,299
Yeah, I thank you so much

6031
04:46:38,939 --> 04:46:45,819
Everybody's the one person by point one points. I would be oh my god. I'm I'm honestly shocked. I'm honestly shocked

6032
04:46:46,139 --> 04:46:47,900
Are you guys the great? I?

6033
04:46:47,900 --> 04:46:51,580
Forget it. Like I said in the very beginning all these grades. They just horse shit. It's just for fun

6034
04:46:51,659 --> 04:46:54,139
So i'm i'm glad everybody had a good time. I know i know don't worry

6035
04:46:54,639 --> 04:46:58,799
We spent like 20 minutes grading your crusty crab like number by number

6036
04:46:59,279 --> 04:47:02,799
If it doesn't mean anything, I mean I've I would have probably given myself like a 96

6037
04:47:03,200 --> 04:47:09,580
Well, thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you guys honors each shake get rolled. Um, it was a pleasure

6038
04:47:10,299 --> 04:47:12,000
Yeah

6039
04:47:12,000 --> 04:47:14,000
All right. Take it easy guys. Thanks for sticking around

6040
04:47:16,639 --> 04:47:26,060
Thank you, bye bye thanks also the mods too the mods helped facilitate a lot of this so thanks mods. All right

6041
04:47:26,959 --> 04:47:29,709
Uh, that was really interesting

6042
04:47:30,400 --> 04:47:32,400
Uh, I think I had a lot of fun

6043
04:47:32,560 --> 04:47:34,080
Hopefully everybody else did

6044
04:47:34,080 --> 04:47:36,319
Technically speaking. I think it yeah

6045
04:47:36,319 --> 04:47:38,959
Maybe we could drop the amount that people can do a tour

6046
04:47:39,360 --> 04:47:42,560
Because some people was like eight minutes then it was like 15 6 12

6047
04:47:42,639 --> 04:47:46,520
I think we could probably make it so it's like you get 12 minutes and that's it but

6048
04:47:47,080 --> 04:47:50,299
Um, I had a blast. That was a lot of fun. If you guys liked it

6049
04:47:50,380 --> 04:47:53,959
I would love to do another one get some other streamers to get some more people involved

6050
04:47:55,869 --> 04:48:03,740
So just about at like the four and a half five hour mark right now. So I think that's good. Sounds good

6051
04:48:05,680 --> 04:48:09,549
I don't mind having no limits. Yeah, I mean it it

6052
04:48:10,360 --> 04:48:14,119
I wanted to give people the room to kind of just kind of go and meme and do whatever they wanted

6053
04:48:14,520 --> 04:48:20,040
So but yeah, I mean the the screen sharing was the technical stuff through it looked pretty good. I

6054
04:48:20,520 --> 04:48:24,759
Uh, the only thing is jolts looked like kind of that kind of chunky playstation 1

6055
04:48:24,759 --> 04:48:27,880
But the good part is you could watch it on jolts stream, too

6056
04:48:27,959 --> 04:48:31,799
So that was part of it to make sure that you could see a high quality version, but it was awesome

6057
04:48:32,119 --> 04:48:39,470
Jolts was great. I loved it. Um, yeah, I I would love to do this again. Thanks everybody for watching

6058
04:48:40,189 --> 04:48:43,069
See you soon. Uh, that's it for me. That's really all I had planned

6059
04:48:43,840 --> 04:48:49,180
I if is anybody else gonna stick around and stream that was there if they are we can throw a raid to them

6060
04:48:49,180 --> 04:48:59,259
If people are still reading, I mean if people are still streaming. Yeah, that was fun

6061
04:49:00,319 --> 04:49:02,319
Yeah, thanks everybody that participated. I know

6062
04:49:02,799 --> 04:49:06,080
Uh kind of taking a like a four or five hour chunk out of your day

6063
04:49:06,810 --> 04:49:10,810
To kind of hang out for a while is it's a lot to ask but I appreciate it everybody that was there

6064
04:49:15,159 --> 04:49:20,919
Raid the winner. That's actually a good idea. That's funny highest grade gets the raid

6065
04:49:21,400 --> 04:49:26,540
Or should we split it between three people is uh, so

6066
04:49:27,180 --> 04:49:29,799
Um doug doug

6067
04:49:29,799 --> 04:49:31,229
rt

6068
04:49:31,229 --> 04:49:37,979
And italics are the top three rt has our rt is ending of the top three who is not ending

6069
04:49:38,139 --> 04:49:48,700
He said rt is ending is doug doug still streaming is italics still streaming because italics technically was in second place

6070
04:49:54,380 --> 04:49:56,380
You should raid the loser instead

6071
04:49:59,000 --> 04:50:16,110
No, connor's house was fucking funny. It was great. All right, uh, is italics still planning on streaming as I do this

6072
04:50:16,189 --> 04:50:21,229
Let me do that. Let me put the actual shit up here now

6073
04:50:21,950 --> 04:50:23,229
Yeah, there we go

6074
04:50:23,229 --> 04:50:35,520
Let me ask him. Let's see if he's still going turn this down for just a second. I'll back in here

6075
04:50:36,729 --> 04:50:41,259
Uh italics are you here?

6076
04:50:41,259 --> 04:50:43,419
He is deafened and muted

6077
04:50:43,979 --> 04:50:52,990
The talics is not streaming anymore. It's how presenting. All right, so doug doug is the third up. So italics is ending

6078
04:50:54,349 --> 04:50:59,709
So go say hi to your number three your top of the class doug doug with his unbelievable

6079
04:51:00,889 --> 04:51:02,490
royalty free

6080
04:51:02,490 --> 04:51:08,119
Uh doug land have I been summoned? Oh, I was saying if you're still streaming you're ending, right?

6081
04:51:09,209 --> 04:51:13,529
Yeah, i'm probably gonna take off just because it's been it's been a great five hours though. Yeah

6088
04:51:48,200 --> 04:51:52,599
It was very good. I can't do it again. That was that was the only time I got I gotta find a new gimmick for

6089
04:51:53,560 --> 04:51:55,560
