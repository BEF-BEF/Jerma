1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:09,929
Thank you for your patience. I have returned and it looks like, wow, there is pretty unanimous.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:19,050
The secret PlayStation 2 game is actually a, apparently it's a, I've never played it,

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:30,820
but it's a really, really, really great game from what I've been told. The secret PlayStation 2

4
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:51,210
video game that we're going to play right now for a little bit is Shadow of Rome, question marks.

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:04,010
I didn't even know what it was. We blew it. Shadow of Rome. It's a, a game.

6
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,260
Good job. All right, all right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now that you, now that you've opened

7
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:22,060
the box, do you want to revote with Shadow of Rome? Because I didn't know what this was until

8
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:34,700
I went into the closet and looked at it. No, I'm playing it. I'm playing it. You guys picked the

9
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:43,959
mystery box. You, you can't up 70% of you opened up the fucking crate and sorry. Sorry. You didn't

10
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:54,040
get, you didn't get a knife this time or whatever it is people look for now. That was guitar, man.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,650
That was very, very fun. A little like two plus hour, a little fun game. We're going to try Shadow

12
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:12,629
of Rome now. Apparently people are already talking shit, but I don't know if you should be. We're

13
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:18,409
going to play I'm Jammer Lambie regardless. We're going to play I'm Jammer Lambie regardless of if

14
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:26,789
that shows up now. We're also going to play both the Parappa games, but who knows this?

15
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,259
This could be a very, very, very big deal game. I feel like a lot of people might actually really

16
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:44,180
like this. I don't know. Uh, this is not the original Guitar-O-Man anymore. This is that

17
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:52,840
create a save file. Okay. We'll see if in the first, we'll give it 30 minutes. If in 30 minutes,

18
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:00,379
we can reliably say this, this game sucks. Okay. Then this game contains scenes of violence.

19
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:17,750
Okay. Um, what do I? Not Guitar-O-Man. This is a strategy game. This is a top-down RTS game.

20
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:35,740
This guy's still interested? It's not. Okay. I don't want people to take off because of this

21
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:42,710
setback. This game is going to be fucked up.

22
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,310
Continually defending her from hostile neighboring states.

23
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,000
As the power struggle ensued in the political arena, the quality of Roman life declined.

24
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,139
It was then that a great man appeared and changed the fate of Rome.

25
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,220
A most celebrated hero, Rome, Julius Caesar, super villain.

26
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,180
Disturbances were squelched and discontent alleviated under his competent dominion.

27
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:45,800
With the rule of Julius Caesar, all who inhabited Rome waited hopefully. I spelled Colosseum so

28
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,829
incorrectly years that it can't even, it's not, there's no auto-correct to help me. Colosseum,

29
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,149
Colosseum. But it was not to last. Despite her citizen's wishes,

30
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:12,100
Rome was once again sucked into the vortex of violence and destruction.

31
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:22,970
Yeah, it's Colosseum. Colosseum War. What a shitty title. Colosseum War. That's a great iPad,

32
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:46,310
like iPhone game. All right, I'm keeping it okay. Imagine you have to keep the analog in a thing

33
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,269
and it's a rhythm game. Did I get killed? Now, wait a minute. Spoilers, by the way,

34
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,970
if you don't know about, this is a huge spoiler. I just, I know you, if you're looking at this

35
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:07,610
history class, Caesar gets stabbed. It's a huge part of like the last season. He's, that's the

36
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:16,420
line, yeah. I'm sorry if you've, I just spoiled like history 101 for you. Now you're gonna be

37
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:25,350
pissed because now you know how it ends. We got four options. Violence. Violence on. What do you

38
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:37,319
mean? Violence off. Player cannot cut enemies into pieces. Green blood? Why green blood?

39
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:47,350
Like I don't want to keep green blood on. They're all like aliens. Okay, I want to keep that up.

40
00:06:49,620 --> 00:07:20,600
Uh, subtitles on the screen. That's fine. I thought about it, but this is like 2001 hard.

41
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:31,000
It's different. It's not like 2020 hard. This game is insanely hard. What was I thinking?

42
00:07:31,639 --> 00:08:04,860
Do I get to choose my weapon? Which one of these guys is me? Opening, opening, opening.

43
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:22,500
What's this really long intro? What's my, what's this guy's name?

44
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:41,220
Kratos? Something like that, right? You're on. I'll explain today's event. First mess. Three

45
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:48,740
potentially lethal rooms await you. The first room is set up battle royale style. You must defeat

46
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,899
all your opponents to proceed to the next room. There are a few weapons. Fight it out for them.

47
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,700
In the second room is a guard. He's carrying a weapon, so don't let your guard down.

48
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,620
In the last room, you'll just have to find out what awaits you there.

49
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:12,259
Okay, so you move with left analog, move camera right analog. Press R3 to center the camera. Good

50
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:16,659
to know. Press circle button when the talk icon is displayed. You can also listen to the conversations

51
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:26,889
of others this way. So circles talk and listen. Did I just, was there a down three rooms? Hey,

52
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:41,190
this won't be easy. What a salvo list. Memo. Defeat the enemies. All right, well, let's just go.

53
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:53,480
Go to the first room. How do I leave? Can I leave? Did you catch all that? No, explain it again.

54
00:09:55,659 --> 00:10:06,360
Yep, three rooms. Yes, yes. I wanted to see if I could go down. I understand. Let's let me out.

55
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:15,019
Talk to the masked man by the gate. Can you buy stuff? New recruits enter the arena unarmed.

56
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,379
Pick up weapons to defend yourself. If you want to enter with weapons, prove your worth by

57
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:27,480
finishing by winning a few times, okay? Are you ready to enter the arena? Yes. Give the audience

58
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:38,330
a match to remember. Please upgrade the resolution. I can't do that. That doesn't exist. This is,

59
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,940
you're, this is 20 years ago. Press the circle button near the desired weapon to pick it up.

60
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:54,279
Okay, why is that guy so huge? Hold R1 to lock onto an enemy and main attack is X,

61
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:14,580
sub attack is circle, is square. Get the big guy first. He's got green blood. He's a fucking

62
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:22,710
science experiment. No, work together. Your weapon will break once its durability reaches zero.

63
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,950
Be sure to watch your durability gauge to make sure you aren't left fighting without a weapon.

64
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:36,409
Okay, where's the durability gauge? Oh, there it is. Ow. Is there a dodge? Is there like a dodge roll?

65
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,860
Shoulder ram. When unarmed, press the X button while stepping forward to ram the enemy. If you're

66
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:56,899
lucky, he may just lose his grip on his weapon. Shoulder ram. Okay, that's a shoulder ram.

67
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:27,899
No, give me that weapon. Get the, why would you bounce off of somebody? Step on his head. Threat

68
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:34,789
from above. What? What do you mean threat from above? Yeah, I want the weapon. Give me the guy

69
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:50,980
with the weapon. Give me the, give me the weapon. Oh, that guy has it. Steal the enemy's weapon.

70
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,259
Sometimes you will end up grabbing hold of the enemy's weapon after you shoulder ram.

71
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,779
At that time, repeatedly press X or square to pry the weapon from their hands.

72
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:13,049
I'll get it every time. All right, that guy's dead. Okay, got him. Now, is there any of the weapons?

73
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:26,789
Oh, domino effect. Is this thing already broken? Okay, get attention from the audience.

74
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,019
Appeal to the spectators by pressing square and X buttons at the same time. Time it right,

75
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:37,740
and you may just get your hands on a weapon that won't please the audiences with your performance

76
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,639
the better your chance of having to throw out a powerful weapon. Give me something. Holy shit,

77
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:59,940
that's big. Anything else? I'll take the grand halberd. What did I do? He's using his arm.

78
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:18,230
That's a guy's arm. Holy shit. Give me another weapon. Cheese. While holding meat, cheese, bread,

79
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,940
et cetera, press the square button to eat and restore some health. Tap square to eat faster.

80
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:44,659
Looks like fucking Minecraft. All right, let's go. Who's left? All right, next room. How long do I

81
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:51,820
get to keep the halberd for? Now, this, this, this is a garden here, right? It's not a land mine,

82
00:14:51,820 --> 00:15:00,779
is it? Hold L1 to guard. No, give me, are you serious? No, I'm gonna cut this guy in half.

83
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:22,730
End him. Yeah, we're just gonna throw a bow. Give me a bow. Oh, fuck, there's people here.

84
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:49,909
How do you fire the bow? Um, what else dropped? Can I pick this guy up and like throw him? I need

85
00:15:49,909 --> 00:16:03,289
a dodge roll. Bad. I got a ram. All right, come here. No, no, no, no, no. What's dodge? What's

86
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:11,990
dodge roll? I know it exists. Kill him. Stab him. What? You have a knife in your hand. Stab him.

87
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:49,159
Fuck. Can you throw? Give me something. What'd he break? Oh shit. I have no weapon. No. This guy

88
00:16:49,159 --> 00:17:01,320
back here. He's like having trouble. What do I do? Give me that. No, this guy over. Are you serious?

89
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,319
I'm gonna get fucking embarrassed by this tired guy with the shield. Really?

90
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:32,230
Don't even think about it. No, no, no, no. Pick up that. I need that shield. Oh, give me a fucking

91
00:17:32,230 --> 00:18:00,180
break. How did that not hit you? Pick it up. Oh my god. Kill him. What's wrong with my head?

92
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:33,500
Kill him. Why? Kill him. He's dead. Geez. Give me the new mace. Crawl through a hole?

93
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:42,069
Where's the last door? What happens if I lose here? It's more than one of the common criminals. Cowards

94
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:48,329
who haven't resolved to fight. I hereby order the execution of these dogs. Let the crowds be

95
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:54,869
pleased by their grisly demise. Hold the X button down for a short while and you'll perform a powerful

96
00:18:54,869 --> 00:20:06,970
attack. There's no cheese. No, I don't want to kill these guys. Where's my choice? He's dodged.

97
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:16,950
And actually, where are you guys getting these from? How do you throw that from there? How do

98
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:27,319
you- this thing has to be like 200 pounds. Oh, you have another mall.

99
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,519
All right, give me something faster than this. I- they- hold on.

100
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:25,079
Give me this thing. You're in trouble? Hold on. I cut that guy's head off and he peed out of his head?

101
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:54,140
Uh oh. Cheese. Give me it. I want more cheese. Watch out. Okay. Just little hits. Small ones.

102
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:18,490
Oh, fuck. Stab him. Stab him through the face. Stab him. Really? Stab him. It wouldn't break.

103
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:45,380
Anybody got another one of those? Uh oh. Get him down. Shit. Oh, fuck. He almost- why does

104
00:22:45,380 --> 00:23:10,500
this keep breaking? Everybody loves me. The crowd loves me. Wait, don't I have to like execute that

105
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,859
doesn't- doesn't see- oh. Yeah. I was gonna say doesn't Caesar put his hand up or hand- thumbs

106
00:23:15,859 --> 00:24:07,720
down, thumbs up? Not like this. It's Chris Redfield? No. It's- I don't know. Chapter one,

107
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,759
the wickedness of men. Marvelous madness has invaded not only the wicked but even those who

108
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:36,740
are held to be good. Change blood. Red blood. Why would I do that? We want violence. You're getting

109
00:24:36,740 --> 00:25:03,670
violence. I thought this was a Colosseum game. This better not be a sneak around game. Don't do

110
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:25,380
the few days earlier thing and have me sneak around. And here as well. Centurion Agrippa.

111
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:36,740
There is no doubt of it. It is certain that it belonged to a Roman messenger, sir.

112
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:49,339
Guitar Man was fun, wasn't it? They have been captured. It has not been long since they left.

113
00:25:50,059 --> 00:26:19,400
We shall separate and look for them. Do I play as the wolf? Rome has embarked on a campaign to the

114
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:24,680
Germanic territories in the north, endeavoring to fully secure its realm. During the battle,

115
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,640
a group of Roman messengers disappeared suddenly while in enemy territory. In order to prevent

116
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,640
the spread of confidential information, reconnaissance troops have been dispatched

117
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:49,859
to the forest of Germania. Wait, this is- press select button to bring up the map screen.

118
00:26:50,740 --> 00:27:09,880
Player. Enemy. Ally. Target. Item. Weapon. Okay, well, I'm- no, there's no friendly fire.

119
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,920
I've been to many land and weathered my share of harsh climbs, but I must say that this place

120
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:20,789
may well be the worst. All right, well, I'm gonna go over here in this tent because there's a weapon

121
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:39,960
in here. I don't know what was in there, but it's not there anymore. He's having a tantrum. Okay,

122
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,579
well, what's this item then? Change blood. Change blood. I'm not gonna change the blood.

123
00:27:47,539 --> 00:28:00,539
No, this is a PG-13 stream. Something in there. All right, let's just- I just gotta go this way.

124
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:17,579
No, I don't want to get in- I don't want to get in trouble. If my mom comes in in this red blood,

125
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:30,250
she's gonna be very concerned, and I'm gonna have to explain. Please call me if you need anything.

126
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:42,410
What is it? Tell the men it's time to mobilize. Should I have done that? That is enough. Let us

127
00:28:42,410 --> 00:29:01,059
move forth. All right, here we go. All right, what happens if I turn into red and then turn

128
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:06,980
into green after one hit? Supra attack. Press the X button while holding R1 and pressing the

129
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,859
left analog stick forward. Press X while holding R1 and pressing the left analog backwards.

130
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:55,829
My mom's gonna fucking kill me. How did I do that dodge roll? Supra! Give me that kick. Does

131
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:59,829
kick get rid of the shield? That guy's gonna get destroyed.

132
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:20,170
That guy went pretty high. Red blood is uninspired. It's the enemy's fort. They must be close.

133
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:31,670
I want to go back to the arena. Thank you.

134
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:45,109
I was gonna say, that would have been terrible. We must hurry. The cremation of the assassinated

135
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:53,130
Julius Caesar took place in the Foro Romano as the raging flames reduced Rome's former ruler

136
00:30:53,130 --> 00:31:00,250
to ashes. All who looked on were struck by the poignancy of his own too early demise.

137
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:12,039
Sugar, spice, and everything. And here comes Cicero, champion of the Senate.

138
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:19,130
We, the members of the Senate, have found the man responsible for the grotesque

139
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:34,460
betrayal of Julius Caesar. It is the traitor of Rome, Lipsonius. Lipsonius?

140
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:45,700
That is Zagreba's father. It cannot be. It is not true. Did not kill Caesar. I would never do such

141
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:57,059
a thing. Kill him. Kill him. I shall now announce the successor to the hero Julius Caesar,

142
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:04,900
the man who shall ascend as the just ruler of the nation. It's going to be me.

143
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:28,200
This does the Maggie. Oh, is that him? People of Rome, as Caesar has expressed in his will,

144
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:35,579
Tonius shall step up as his rightful successor. How much money does that,

145
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:44,839
how much money does that skin cost? 600 gems? To dedicate my life to the glory of Rome.

146
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:51,380
I just, I don't get the cape. It's bullshit. It's not fair. I cannot believe that Lipsonius

147
00:32:51,380 --> 00:33:05,450
would do such a thing. That really divided chat. Constant fucking conflict. I didn't,

148
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:12,970
somebody read it. I didn't. Vipsanius, a murderer. There's got to be more to this story.

149
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:29,509
Rome will never know a hero like Caesar. What's that? You're concerned about that wretched criminal.

150
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:40,970
Are you a friend of that traitor? Here comes the lore. Caesar may have charmed with his elegance,

151
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:53,400
but no one can ignore Antonius's youthful grace. Antonius is the most capable of Caesar's advisors.

152
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:05,369
Surely no one will find. All right, well, what do we do? He loves Caesar. He held him in the highest

153
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:14,920
regard. Could he have faked his admiration and loyalty? The Senate house is but a stone

154
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,840
throw away. It's only a moment's journey by foot. That said, I fear the real challenge will be

155
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:36,760
found in gaining entry. The Senate house. Yes, leave. This game is not what I thought it was

156
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:47,820
going to be. This actually is like a strategy game. I don't know who the fuck I am. Man,

157
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:54,170
this is bullshit. I get to play the first 22 minutes as Snake and now I get to be

158
00:34:54,170 --> 00:35:03,210
riding for the rest of the game. Don't do this shit. Apparently Caesar hated having security

159
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:11,369
guards think it would end like this. It's been successful. I mean, pretty cool. Interesting

160
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:39,190
lore here, but I mean, I got to get in the Senate house. Yes. Hi. Here we go. What?

161
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:45,349
That's a quick way to die. This is not a child's playground.

162
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:51,349
He's got a Rolex? What is on his arm? He's got like a fucking nice watch.

163
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:06,539
Octavianus.

164
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:32,519
Senate meeting. Go home now. Please watch Rome on HBO. It's very good.

165
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:44,260
All right. Add. What do you mean add? I just read that. I would have gripped his father,

166
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:52,489
slay Caesar. I must speak to the Senate. This must be a misunderstanding. What troubles you,

167
00:36:52,489 --> 00:37:07,849
young man? Give me like a spear. It's all we want. Who are you? Have you forgotten old Pansa,

168
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:23,110
good Octavianus? People still name like Octavianus and like Asperinius or whatever.

169
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:52,469
No. How did we get from there to like Dan? Oh, Octavianus. Steve. Hold L2. Oh, it is. What is

170
00:37:52,469 --> 00:38:14,099
this? L2 is sneak. Oh, fuck sneaking. I missed the stab. Holy shit. He just did the back stab to me.

171
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:36,059
He got behind me. Oh, listen to that. Right there. Got it. Give me that. Can't fall off. There's no

172
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:50,980
joke there. Sorry, guys. Steve is short for Stevius. No, it is not. We've got a long way to go.

173
00:38:51,619 --> 00:39:06,920
I think we just started taking off the Eus off of our names. Like, you know, like Jeremiah Eus.

174
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:22,969
Then it went to Jeremiah and then it went to Jeremy. That is true. You can throw in this game

175
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:26,889
one full letter grid. Press triangle while holding weapon to throw it straight ahead.

176
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:44,199
Did I get him? I don't even see what happened. Did I? What? I hit him. Cut this tree down.

177
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:56,059
You actually do cut the tree down. That's pretty cool, actually. That doesn't go. He just,

178
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,980
guys, there's a guy here, you know. Nice work.

179
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:16,889
Give me, I want that. I want his torch. What just happened? He just spit in our face.

180
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:37,989
There we go. Give me the torch. Get sand. All right, we're reaching about the 30 minute mark.

181
00:40:43,619 --> 00:41:03,269
It's almost there. Ow. It's fun. It's fun. But it's just not, I don't think it's 2019 fun.

182
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:19,110
Like back like 20 years ago, this is probably the best game that ever came out like for the year.

183
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:45,179
What's my favorite game of all time? That's too, that's too much of a loaded question.

184
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:55,699
I looked at chat, I looked over here and I thought there was an arrow in my head.

185
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:04,650
How is it loaded? Because this is that I can't answer it. First person view. Look at this. It's

186
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:13,579
got first person mode. Press R to FPV mode. FPV. Just look at how old this is. They couldn't even,

187
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:40,489
FPS. First person FPV. You can zoom in and zoom out. All right, so throw. Uh, can you see me?

188
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:57,900
Is he shooting arrows? I don't think so. Well, what was that? Throw it back. Quick,

189
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:12,019
do something funny. I don't, I'm just kind of, I'm trying to throw a rock at this guy.

190
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:24,489
Was that like funny? The rocks are all broken now. Just get out of the, why are you standing in the

191
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:39,590
way? These guys, these NPCs don't do anything but just get in the way. No, this way. There you go.

192
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:58,809
Fuck off. All right, now burn him. I can't, I can't even see. The sequel to this game became

193
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:12,679
Dead Rising halfway through development. Are you serious? That's kind of awesome. That's ridiculous.

194
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:33,380
Yeah, the way you throw shit too is to just play Dead Rising. Because this game did so poorly,

195
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:47,780
they changed the game mid-development. Are you kidding me? No way. Okay, I, maybe I will play

196
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:55,820
Dead Rising. I've, I played Dead Rising like three. Um, there's like 15 people here. I was

197
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:07,179
supposed to sneak, I think. Just go in the door. The door is locked. Well, that's fucking horrible.

198
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:36,469
I'm dead. Didn't I have two friends? Are they dead? This is it. Don't lock on. Just hit.

199
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:51,099
Oh fuck, he's going around me. Give me that. Give me, give me, give me, give me. Don't die.

200
00:45:51,659 --> 00:46:03,699
All right, I was trying to, wait, can, somebody gonna throw me cheese? From where? All the way

201
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:09,559
back? Like in three years? Hold on, so someone's in three years in the future is gonna throw me

202
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:35,079
cheese from behind the rock. Die. Die. Die before I play Unjammer Lammy. Secret PlayStation 2 game

203
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:56,179
that I forgot I had. It's pretty good. It's, it's pretty good. Nice Resident Evil death screen.

204
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:05,349
Time to bring in Lammy. I think it's time to bring in Lammy. I think so. And well, here's the,

205
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:10,389
hold on a minute here. This is important. Oh, this, this like sucked. No, no, no, because this

206
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:16,789
confirmed that I was going to play Dead Rising 1. If I didn't do this, we would not have come to

207
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:22,070
the conclusion that I was going to play Dead Rising 1 on stream. You understand? Like how things,

208
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:33,159
there's like cause and effect. It was worth doing this. Imagine, yeah, imagine the timeline

209
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:35,880
that would have, I wouldn't have, never would have probably played Dead Rising 1 on stream.

210
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:45,800
It was worth doing. Absolutely. Now let's play Unjammer Lammy. Pretty good secret stream.

211
00:47:46,519 --> 00:48:02,659
I don't even know, where is Unjammer Lammy? Oh, fuck, that's right. It's not here yet. It's

212
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:10,360
being delivered like tomorrow. Just kidding. Relax. See, hold on. So the, are you telling me

213
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:18,360
the PlayStation 2 can do this? Are you sure? I have like the PlayStation 2 baby. I don't

214
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,039
have like the big one. Can the little baby PlayStation 2 do it?
