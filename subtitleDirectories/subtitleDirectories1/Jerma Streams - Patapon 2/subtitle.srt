1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:01:04,170
Hello. Hold on. And I had to tweet too. I had to tweet that out. That we're playing Patapon.

2
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:16,579
Hello, good afternoon. How's your day going? Is it going good? Good. He's a social media mogul.

3
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,680
Can't wait for social media tycoon. Started zero likes. Can you get up to 500,000 followers?

4
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:44,329
Does that exist? Does that game exist? It probably does. But yeah, I'm gonna play Patapon 2,

5
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:49,450
actually. Not just Patapon. Patapon 2. In the pre-stream chat, we had a little bit of a

6
00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:00,390
vote. And I've been told that Patapon 2 is just a better version of Patapon 1

7
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:06,900
in almost every way. It's just one but better. That's what I've been told. And that's what

8
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,539
we're gonna do. Because look, we can always go back into the prequel. But I'm gonna give it a

9
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:23,340
shot. We'll see how it goes. We'll play for a while. See if I like it. New game? Yeah, we did.

10
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:36,199
Gotcha Force. Gotcha Force is dumb. I loved every second of it. Patapon 3 waiting room.

11
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,979
I heard Patapon 3 is not very good. Doesn't people say Patapon 3 is the not good one?

12
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:58,860
It's too grindy. Who made this? I saw a Japan studio pop up. What company actually made this?

13
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:13,060
Bungie. I don't know. Bungie didn't make this. Pyramid did. Pyramid Studios.

14
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:27,560
Bungie. They need to make a new Patapon. Am I gonna love this game? We're about to find out.

15
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:46,870
But right now? Am I gonna love this game? Place your bets. It's kind of already doing it for me.

16
00:03:46,870 --> 00:04:02,939
Not much time has gone by and I already like it. All right, so let's do a new game. How can

17
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:14,650
I continue nothing? I'm ready. Let's go. As the ship neared completion, Patapon suddenly remembered

18
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,889
an old story. Almighty leader, let's sail off into the dark unknown as our search for earthen.

19
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:29,959
I didn't get to read it. Patapons bravely set off on their voyage, leaving behind their loved ones,

20
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,439
friends, and the safety of their home island. They braved many violent storms and sweated through

21
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,560
many scorching days. It was indeed a long and arduous voyage, but the brave Patapons refused

22
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,699
to give up. This is Patapon 1. However, all their suffering was insignificant compared to the trouble

23
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,459
they had. Only after 49 days and 49 nights, the Patapons truly learned of the evils that lurked

24
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:56,100
below the depths of the sea. Their fate unknown. What will become of the Patapons now? All right,

25
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:06,199
we just watched the whole, we got the whole story from Patapon 1. Patapon oath. I gotta take this.

26
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:16,819
I, hold on. I hereby pledge to honor and keep my promise to be the great leader of the Patapons

27
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:22,740
and help them reach earthen. I will not stray from my goal, even in the face of death or great

28
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,019
peril. Even at moments of weakness, I will keep the beat and feel the rhythm of the earth.

29
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,930
From this point forward, I promise to keep my pledge and take this drum of courage and be the

30
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:43,529
mighty leader I was meant to be. This is my oath. Won't you tell us your name, almighty one?

31
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:51,180
Transfer Patapon save data. Tell us your name.

32
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:29,430
Okay, well, okay, you can only do four letters. Welcome to the world of Patapon. Oh, great one.

33
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,110
If this is your first time playing, might we recommend you start off in the easy mode? Oh,

34
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:42,889
no. What do I do? Do I say no? Okay, how hard is Patapon? Is this a hard game?

35
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:57,980
No, say yes. Yes. If they laugh, it's extremely hard. Hardest game. Yes, it's hard. Can I,

36
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:10,569
okay, can I change the difficulty whenever I want? No. Can I, I can't change the difficulty.

37
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:33,379
Hey! Patapon. It's a kid's game. Every game is a kid's game, apparently. Oh, it's a rhythm game.

38
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,810
Name me a game that's not a kid's game. That you guys would, all right, I just got freaked out

39
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,649
because I was like, why doesn't it know my name? I just put it in. Earthen turned out to be

40
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,410
unreachable. The Patapon's long voyage ended as this ship sank to the bottom of the ocean. I told you.

41
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,100
Washed up on an unknown shore alone, Hatapon exhausts its last ounce of strength to hold

42
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:04,170
onto the sacred drum. Almighty leader, I pray to you. I'm the leader? I beg of you, please have

43
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:12,839
mercy on us, Patapons. Pon pon pon, strike the drum four times. Listen to the drum's rhythm. Pon

44
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:25,300
pon pon pon. Okay. That was cute. You got it. There are four drum beats in one measure. If you

45
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,259
keep to the beat for four counts, one measure, you'll perform a command. Give it a try. Hit

46
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:41,990
pon four times in a row to save the princess. This is like a turn-based RPG. Listen to that drum. I

47
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:50,580
feel it returning our power. What could it be, our mighty leader? Oh benevolent one, I always knew

48
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,940
you would come for us. That's why I protected the drum at all costs. Please take the drum.

49
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:03,529
I'll take it. How many drums do I get? We're going to learn about the next one.

50
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:19,980
Okay, that's pon, pata. Cool. What battery do I have in this controller? We'll find out. Almighty

51
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,220
leader, I pray to you. Almighty Jerry, lend your strength to the Patapon so that they may continue

52
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:41,620
their quest. Let's practice. Next, pata, pata, pata pon. Pata pon. Easy there, mighty leader.

53
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,490
Chillax and feel the rhythm. If you match the four beats properly. I didn't do it.

54
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:57,129
Please don't beat. Wait, what? Patapons will march for four beats. When they stop,

55
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:15,830
you got to start drumming. Oh, I haven't done it. Okay. It's four beats in one measure. Okay.

56
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:39,179
Okay. I'm going to fuck this all up, aren't I? They're going to get so hard. You're ready.

57
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:59,350
I feel like I have Pringles can. Anybody want to invite me to their band? I'm pretty good at the

58
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:43,379
Pringles. I can't read. You can read it. Too much fever. Wait, we have to fight? Do I just sit back

59
00:11:43,379 --> 00:12:06,330
here and just make noise? Attack. I did it. Do you just have to keep the beat? That's going to end

60
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,809
up being like square, circle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, square, square, square, X.

61
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:21,110
Now I'm going to fuck the whole thing up and have to quit the game. Third time, four minutes,

62
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:34,460
touching, zero, coils, none. This seems kind of cool. Patapon's march. It's easy to look at

63
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,059
the Patapon's location. He's always dead center. I thought it was the same place. He's always dead.

64
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,909
Okay. During the Pata Pata march, Hatapon will march along with the rest of the army.

65
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:47,429
During the Pon Pon attack, chant, he'll bravely maintain his position.

66
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,879
Uh, all right. A mysterious race that hide their face behind masks.

67
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,370
Medan came upon them when she went wandering on an unknown. She took Hatapon and the others

68
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,730
to the place she had stumbled upon. They arrived at the end of the night in the ruins of Patapon's

69
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:17,139
village, Patopolis. I gotta turn this up on my end. Almighty Jeremy, thank you for helping me out

70
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:29,100
of that disaster. You're welcome. I need to be able to hear the beat. All right. Yeah, you're

71
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,700
welcome. Great to see you again. I'm the priestess of the great Patapon. My name is Medan. Your

72
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:42,330
return celebration is about to start, but first please follow me. This stone obelisk is the pride

73
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,649
of the Patapon tribe. It shows that our ancestors once thrived in this area. If we want to reach

74
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:54,309
Earthen, do we have to retake the former Patopolis? We'll talk more later. Right now,

75
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:57,830
please head through the obelisk to go hunting for some meat to fill our stomachs.

76
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:19,059
What? I can like move around. Look, I should save. Okay, cool. Let's go hunting on Torchira

77
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:23,620
beach. Those Patophons are always hungry. Hunt some game so they can prepare some meat.

78
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:36,679
All right, let's do it. Headquarters. These are the troops. HP 120 crit ratio 15%.

79
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:47,340
Damage 4 to 12. Attack speed 2. Resist. Ignite. All right. Equip. Wooden helm. Wooden sphere.

80
00:14:48,220 --> 00:15:01,539
Do they have it on? Wooden helm. Standard issue helmet. Okay, a normal Patapon. You can select

81
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:10,600
who. All right, should I give somebody hair? What's the hair do? Hairpiece worn by the lord

82
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:20,700
of a certain island country grants the user a body of steel. All right, let's do it. I love this.

83
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:32,539
There's an optimize button. Look at that stat difference. Is there a bad stat difference?

84
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:40,899
Wait, how do I equip? Lordly hairpiece. There's no stat difference. I see like a bunch of

85
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,740
ups or something. What's on the bottom? Just hit optimize. Optimize the squad.

86
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,820
Takes it off. That's resistant. I want you to wear this. Somebody can wear it. Whatever.

87
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:07,580
All right, let's go. Let's rest up. We've got a big day. Lordly hairpiece gives immunity to

88
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:14,440
all statuses. That's cool. All right, are we ready? The Patophons have the courage to fight.

89
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:44,309
It's amazing. That's the way. Guide the Yerepons to find their prey. What was it? What was it?

90
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:51,690
What was it? Wait, hold on. Tell me the forward march. I just got struck by lightning.

91
00:16:52,169 --> 00:17:15,430
Okay. No, shit. What's attack? Okay, attack. What's attack? I don't remember. What was it?

92
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:54,200
What is it? What's attack? What's attack? Attack. Forward. No, not backwards. All right, attack.

93
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:24,970
Again, it hit its dead body. There's too much going on. What do we need? Shit.

94
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:56,740
We're good. I pick up two. What? Ruined. Go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

95
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:16,119
I got three teeth. Earth end to earth end. I'm going to be really bad at this game. I just want to

96
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,000
make that really clear to everybody. There's going to be like five combinations eventually,

97
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,240
and it's going to be too much for me. It's going to get locked up and confused in my brain,

98
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,829
and I'm going to rage put the game in above 45. I'm glad we're seeing the credits right now.

99
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:42,680
There are only four combo. I'm just kidding.

100
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:55,019
Oh, great, Jerry. Thank you for this food that you've blessed us with. Yum. Look how our people

101
00:19:55,019 --> 00:20:00,940
have come home. We're all excited over the great Jerry's return. Hooray for Jerry. Hooray for the

102
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,420
great Patapon. Everyone, give you thanks to Jerry. This grace has made all these blessings possible.

103
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:12,630
Great Jerry, please allow me to show the way to our altar.

104
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:23,660
Phrase. Phrase. All the collected bounty is placed on this altar as a humble offering to you,

105
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:30,819
oh great Jerry. I have to see what kind of offerings have been made. Upgrades? Are they

106
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:38,680
going to do upgrades? This is from me. Pon Pon. The bravery drum obtained by agreeing to become

107
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:49,240
the Patapon God. It's oh. The strokes drum. Okay. The song. Pat-a-pat-a-pat-a-pon. Attack.

108
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,660
Pon Pon Patapon, right? Legendary memory. This great warrior once fought a thousand foes.

109
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:06,230
Meat. Cafeteria meat. Okay. And then wait, there's a crafting system? A magnificent

110
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:24,859
warped fang. Shaved down to use as a weapon. Huh. Oh, all right. Do I eat this? Oh. Use it later for

111
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:34,819
materials. Oh, okay. It's used for upgrades. Oh, all right. That's cool. Can I do anything else?

112
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:39,539
Our wish is to look upon it at earth end. A's upon it for eternal bliss.

113
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:51,910
How come only two people have a piece of meat? All right. Let's go. What's next?

114
00:21:52,710 --> 00:22:01,609
What did they find blocking their way? It's demons. No, it's the Karmic.

115
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:17,140
All right. So wait, can I use the like anything new? Can't use the fangs. Let's just go.

116
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:33,609
Let's rest up. We got a big day tomorrow. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three, and then

117
00:22:33,609 --> 00:23:03,940
will we start? Here we go. Wait, we just start. Now. Attack. Get it. Take it down.

118
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:44,680
Time it. Kill it. Get up there. Wait, it won't crumble. Well, why? Do we have to go home

119
00:23:44,680 --> 00:24:18,700
because we're not strong enough? Oh, okay. Can I pause this? You guys are getting a

120
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,099
delay because people think I'm missing the beat. I think there's a delay because I'm doing it

121
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:38,099
right. Um, how do I, I gotta, I gotta change this. There's a delay on here. See if this fixes it.

122
00:24:38,740 --> 00:25:20,809
For a rhythm game, you guys shouldn't have a delay. Is it better? Better? Okay. Don't kill him.

123
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:32,089
My kind of known as Tetipon. We will join you. Okay. Victory. Let's go. Do I have a new beat now?

124
00:25:41,099 --> 00:26:33,400
Attack. Holy shit. Oh God. Oh God. Go forward. Go, go, go. Can I lose the fever? Get in there.

125
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:48,599
Kill him. All right. Forward, forward, forward, forward. Oh shit. Get this tower.

126
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:24,200
Get him. All right. Forward. Kill. Shit. I thought I was going to be alive.

127
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:41,049
Is that a spell? I don't think you have any trouble. What? Wait, come with us. What?

128
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:56,440
Can we stop singing? Dude, I'm telling you, reading this shit. Okay. Reading and like pressing these

129
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:08,119
buttons is impossible for me. See you later. Mighty Jarrah. Okay. Just go get it. It's a,

130
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:35,769
it's scratching your head and rumbly belly at the same time. Kill it. You're good. It's literally

131
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:52,410
two buttons. All right. Well, I just looked at chat to read what you said. Uh, just rub head

132
00:28:52,410 --> 00:29:24,980
and circle belly. If you land perfect beats, you can get fever twice as fast. Okay. All right.

133
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,019
You'll be constantly acquiring new weapons and helmets. Don't forget to equip them. They'll

134
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:32,789
raise stats like HP and attack power and can become the key to victory. Always use triangle

135
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:42,859
and optimize your Patapon's shoes. Sure. A great warrior, Pan Patapon is a legendary hero.

136
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:48,299
He'll be the one that restores a master sprout to full glory. Great, Jerry. If you could please

137
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:57,579
follow me, I must show you something. We need Mater Sprout to return Mater to the Tree of Life

138
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:03,740
back to life. This must be done. There are rumors of Dodongo is here. The Dodongo ruins

139
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:09,900
just past Nanjaro Hill. Defeat Dodongo and return the Mater Sprout. These are all made up words.

140
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,539
Okay. Oh yeah. I can't believe you can't pronounce a Mater. These are all made up fucking words.

141
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:37,140
It's the guy. What's the guy from Cards? What are you talking about? Cards2fan can't pronounce

142
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:43,640
Mater. Wait, somebody said, so there's one person that was nice to me. What does it say? Don't feel

143
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:51,319
bad about missing the pattern up. You'll get used to it. Wow. A C and a C of, of just, of thank you.

144
00:30:52,200 --> 00:31:02,440
Wow. I mean, I'm so happy to hear that. Holy shit. I thank you. You, I thank you. Wow. I feel great.

145
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,299
All right. What do we get? Common stone full of impurities, but vital nevertheless.

146
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:20,650
Oh, there's a shield. What is this? Key item. And that guy is feeding his ego.

147
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:34,089
All right. I want to make some items. All right. In search of the Mater Sprout and the rumor

148
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:39,369
Dodongo that is said to be roaming around these parts. Unbeknownst to all, a destined meeting is

149
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:51,670
about to take place. Here we go. Let's equip and should we just do optimize? Oh, iron spear. You

150
00:31:51,670 --> 00:32:02,789
have an iron spear. Damage six to 16. All right. Well, yeah, that's good. And switch. I want you in

151
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:21,509
the front then. Oh, somebody in the back. I don't have, I don't have a bow. All right. Well, I'm,

152
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:30,140
I mean, he has an iron now, but I got one. How do I, how do I put it on? Can't make new units yet.

153
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:36,359
Oh, well, whatever. All right. Let's, let's go. Groups ready. All right. I'm going to get it.

154
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,960
That one person. I don't worry about messing up the patterns. You're like going to get rid of,

155
00:32:39,960 --> 00:33:11,430
you'll get it. See? Oh, let's go. That person was just, did it. There we go. Oh, you're missing.

156
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:49,180
Get it. What are they doing? What's wrong? Attack it. Why are you jumping? Why are they jumping

157
00:33:49,180 --> 00:34:03,480
higher? What happened? It's a drum solo. Get over it, Patipont. I'm fucking God. I could do what I

158
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:27,539
want. Oh, we got a triangle now. Oh, mighty leader. Can you hear me? Time for you to learn a third

159
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:33,059
song. The chaka chaka song. This is the lament of defense. Used to get out of tough spots.

160
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:59,190
How is it? What does it do? How do I do it? How do I do it? Oh, fuck. What does it do? Defense?

161
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:41,610
Move. I forget it. I forget it. I don't know what it is. Kill. This? Attack it?

162
00:35:43,050 --> 00:36:09,579
Split it. All right. Now defense. Go forward. What? Oh, hit him. Did I block it?

163
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:31,139
What is this? No, back up, back up, back up. All right. Attack. Kill him. Wait, defense.

164
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:53,719
What? Why did they put the hat on that guy? Kill it. No, no, no, no, no. Don't go forward.

165
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:38,760
I forget the controls. Defense. I fucked it up. Okay. Bro. Oh, I did it. Sounds like the minions.

166
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:58,280
Somebody just lost a shitload of money. Heading on the fact that I wasn't going to figure out

167
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,800
how to do that. I gave a certain. I gave a C with certain. You put like 500 fucking thousand

168
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,039
dollars on that. It's like, what a certain play that is. And you just lost a ton of money.

169
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:19,159
And in a way, I feel bad for you. Here, you bet against me though. All right. If you perfectly

170
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:25,530
time all four beats, you'll hear Crystal's ding. Okay, cool. Rack up enough perfect beats and

171
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:31,369
combo points during fever mode to set off the hero mode. He'll perform unnatural acts of bravery

172
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:40,679
and might depending on his class. All right, that's cool. Jeremy, we finally found the chosen

173
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:53,210
one. Chosen one, huh? Don't make me laugh. I heard it's an old legend. Funny looking mask dude

174
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:00,820
will save the world after meeting Jera the great pattern. Funny looking. Great Jera, what should

175
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,099
we call this strange masked fellow? Call me? You're going to name me? Oh, you must be insane. In the

176
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:25,690
membrane.

177
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:39,860
Hera is a very nice name. I love it. Hera. I guess Hera it is. I like I have a choice.

178
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,449
It's Jera, right? Here's the deal. I must obey the one that names me, which means you.

179
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:57,940
Oh, great Jera and brave Hera, please come this way. This is the Parajet Prime. Only Jera and

180
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,420
Hera can enter. You have a mysterious egg. You can interact with heroes from other worlds.

181
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:12,219
You can't run a mysterious egg, so don't worry as they pat upon. Do you really care about naming

182
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:26,550
them? Let's check it out. I was going to just press enter. I was going to just press enter

183
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:38,710
when you're on hero. All right, let's go in here. Please don't forget the Mater Sprout. We needed to

184
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:46,820
succeed, but you are the chosen one. You can teleport to another world. Okay, that's cool.

185
00:40:47,619 --> 00:41:06,309
Should we do that here? Wait, who are these people? Formation. Dodongo Egg One.

186
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:12,949
Mysterious egg that leads you to battle with Dodongo grants Demerian's power. He Lord of

187
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:23,340
Halon and Fire Tardens. Okay, what do I do with it? Iron Spear. Ooh, what's this thing? Friendship

188
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:40,650
Spear. Raises HP. Friendship Helm. Wow, and a Shuba. Okay, what's this normal? All right,

189
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:53,619
Friendship Spear and Friendship Helm. I can't touch these people, right? Boy,

190
00:41:53,619 --> 00:42:01,780
are you sure you want to engage? Yeah. Wait, what is going on? Going to another world with four heroes?

191
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:33,980
Wait, what? Wait, what? Oh, shit, hold on. All right, now block. He's gonna do it. He's gonna do it.

192
00:42:37,900 --> 00:43:09,860
Kill. Forward. No, go again. Defend. Forward. Forward. Here we go.

193
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:46,039
Attack. Attack again. Attack again. Get it. Oh, wait, what? The boss fight?

194
00:43:47,239 --> 00:44:10,019
All right, now. No, don't do that. Now attack. Spears. Throw. Forward.

195
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:36,219
Karla? Karla. Subs? Holy shit. Come on. A lot of subs came in. That's a lot. That's a lot of subs. A

196
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:48,780
hundred subs. From Zyxia. Thanks for the fucking hundred community subs. That's so many. Wait,

197
00:44:48,780 --> 00:45:03,030
we're not getting out. Kill them. A hundred community subs. Holy shit. Thank you for that.

198
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:10,440
I think there's gonna be an insane amount of subs. Look at those coins. Where'd you get those coins?

199
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:38,389
Oh, shit. Kevon's dead. We got him. I revived him. Attack. Shit. Too much. Too much.

200
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:57,929
All right, now go forward. He's running. Shit, he's not running. Oops, I forgot. Oh, fuck. Wait,

201
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:25,690
wait, wait, wait, wait. Kill him. He's looking kind of fucking grim. Okay, he's running away.

202
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:48,599
Pick it up. What does this do with this? Is this like a slot? Timing's way off. It's not.

203
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:53,159
I mean, it was right there. Look, there's a delay. There's a desync that I can't.

204
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:26,139
Just hold on a second. Oh, there's a time limit on this. This guy's not strong enough.

205
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,550
Are they strong enough for this?

206
00:47:48,650 --> 00:48:17,179
Kill. Kill him. Oh, fuck. That guy got like yeeted the fuck out of here. Is he gone? He's dead.

207
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:57,480
All right, run. Get to the end quick. Yes. The drum in time with the rhythm. What? Oh, what?

208
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:09,429
This is like wrong. Now everyone come together. It's time for the big finish.

209
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:58,280
I did it. One last time. I got him. Oh, it's copyright. No, no, this is not fucking copyright.

210
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:10,619
God damn it. I'll see you guys later. Fuck. I'm out. How was I supposed to know this fucking

211
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:14,780
whole game was copyrighted? What the fuck? That's how they do it to me. Oh, there's a treasure

212
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:30,420
chest. Wait, how much does it cost? 60? Shit. I got adamantium. Okay, hold on. Do you want to

213
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:39,659
change Parachari into Kaching and return to Patopolis? Like I just opened up like my

214
00:50:39,659 --> 00:50:43,420
teenager's phone and looking at text messages and I don't know what these things mean.

215
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:54,019
What is he saying when he's talking to his friend? Do I want to change Parachari into Kaching?

216
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:03,940
Yes, I think. Quite 130 Kaching. I don't know what that does. What is it? All right.

217
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:18,440
There's a delay on the fucking stupid ass thing. Try to fix it. It's ruined. The Pata Gate is a

218
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,320
portal that connects fragments from other Patapon worlds. There's a distinct beat that permeates

219
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:31,400
throughout this realm. Listen closely to its rhythm. Don Shin Kenhai. Success will only be

220
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:37,380
achieved if all hero Patapons follow this special rhythm. I thought I turned off my Discord

221
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:49,059
notifications. Don't call me. A hundred community subs from Zyxia. I want to make sure I address

222
00:51:49,059 --> 00:51:54,900
it because that's a fucking ton of money. That's $500 that they just dropped. Be able to buy those.

223
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,760
Thanks. That's fucking insane. Thank you.

224
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,530
We cut the dinosaur's head off?

225
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:32,489
That's a hundred Little Caesar's pizzas. I mean, yeah, I guess it is. All right. So that was like

226
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:38,489
a little encounter. Oh, this is this game's pretty cute. This is a cool game. All right.

227
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:47,260
We got all this other stuff. Life Seed is hidden somewhere in the Ancient Ruins. Defeat the Dodonga

228
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:56,789
at the Dodonga. Defeat the Dodonga at the Dongara Ruins. Oh, this is the sprout. Okay. Here we go.

229
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:04,980
Let's do some equipment. Let's do some optimization. Iron Spear is wooden helm. Iron

230
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:12,119
helm. Oh, I got an iron helm. It's a lordly hair piece. No, I don't have any more iron helms.

231
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:24,170
Yeah. Put on that funny hair. But you. Friendship Spear. Yeah. Friendship helm. That's all I got.

232
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:34,809
The funny hair. Oh, no, no, no. All right. I think I'm ready. A bunch of iron helms.

233
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:48,650
They're all not wearing them. Oh, oh, oh, oh. You can change the Masked Dude's class.

234
00:53:50,809 --> 00:54:10,489
Hero Mask of Phantom Strike. I don't think I can do a. Oh, just go. Let's rest up. We got a big day.

235
00:54:20,519 --> 00:55:02,539
Oh, it can't be offbeat. I wouldn't have a fever right now. I just defended. Are we all right? Oh,

236
00:55:02,539 --> 00:56:01,960
shit. Blocked it. Broke. Blocked. Good. What? We're dead. Wait, what? Does defend not happen

237
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:12,489
until after they sing it? Because I defended it and then he hit me. But it wasn't ready. Do

238
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:19,260
they have to sing it first? I was like when I when I do defend don't don't don't don't

239
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:26,809
they have to does it take one was too low? Why they all leave? Nobody think I'm cool anymore.

240
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:40,170
Oh, this guy's not we're just guy didn't die. I didn't like that. We're gone. New God. They

241
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:56,539
defend right when the beat finishes. OK, try again. How long does it defend last?

242
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:04,099
One of those things that's like, oh, it's like two seconds or three seconds. There's the next bar.

243
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:31,670
Unturned. OK. Now we go. Did it.

244
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:45,380
We just got struck by fucking lightning. How do you get back? Is it like a go back command?

245
00:57:47,289 --> 00:58:01,429
What's like the go back command? What is it? I don't have that yet. Oh, wait, what?

246
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:30,619
Oh, wait, am I supposed to be here? I think I did it. What's with the lightning?

247
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:38,940
Oh, sorry. I defend. We're going to start for fucking lightning again.

248
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:57,159
Don't don't come on. Get the fuck out of here. Back up, June.

249
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:32,920
Back up. I need the guy. I need that fucking funny hat on. What the fuck? This is the armor.

250
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:38,420
I have iron armor on. Is that the problem? Well, we're dead again.

251
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:46,360
But the lightning is just destroying me. All right. Well, I got to get like lightning

252
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:54,500
resistant. I have to go back and grind. Wait, I can do that. I have to play other. Wait, hold on.

253
00:59:54,500 --> 01:00:04,539
What? Oh, it's not just play the game. I have to go back and like and like grind for items.

254
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:19,190
I got to grind. Hold on. Let me go look at my stuff. You're offbeat. I'm.

255
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:32,119
I can't get fevers consistent. You're not. And I have a shitty Elgato. You are offbeat.

256
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:39,559
How do I get fevers then? That doesn't make sense. All right. So why does fever appear on screen?

257
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:51,750
What are we talking about? Pity fevers. Can we go over this right now?

258
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,199
Is there a delay when I'm selecting these? You guys have seen a delay. You have to be.

259
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:25,380
We're not. What? The drums sound different. What? Just just emulated. I'm going to try this. No,

260
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:32,630
let's see what they have for equipment. What about with my resistance? This guy has a hat on.

261
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:46,570
Iron helm. Wait, was that person lying to me or does this actually conduct electricity with

262
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:52,219
lightning? We need gas lighting and we almost got him. Oh, you do. It happened like 20 minutes ago.

263
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:12,789
He almost got him. Let me try this again. I can't have any other gear. If I don't do

264
01:02:12,789 --> 01:03:12,170
this now, I'm going to go back and get better stuff. Here we go. Here we go. Fuck. Fuck. Attack.

265
01:03:12,170 --> 01:04:42,070
Call it. Where is he? But you guys talk about perfect. Perfect every time. What?

266
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:28,619
You got to get perfect. If you don't hear the cymbal, then don't play the video game.

267
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:36,519
I forgot. Didn't break combo all the entire game, but didn't get it perfect every time. Why even

268
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:46,710
why even load the video game in the first place? I mean, what the hell? Load up a fucking robot to

269
01:05:46,710 --> 01:06:09,139
make every press perfect. You fucking stupid. I did it. Am I on easy? No. Keep to the rhythm

270
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:14,889
for a few counts and score multiple combo points. Soon you'll be in fever mode. When the Patapons

271
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:19,130
are in fever mode, their attack and defense skills increase dramatically. Cool. Yeah. What's the next

272
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:24,329
paragraph say? Oh, if you don't get perfect every time uninstall this game. Oh, is that what it's

273
01:06:24,329 --> 01:06:28,409
trying? I can't see. Can I zoom in? Does it say that anywhere? Where does it say that? I'm just

274
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:43,880
trying to find where that says that. It's you have to scroll. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I didn't scroll.

275
01:06:45,000 --> 01:07:03,619
Roll down. You guys are fucked. All right, let's go. Awakening from the sleep that has

276
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:23,210
overtaken your roots. Oh, we had huge money. Hold on. Throw away 985. Thanks for 50 dollars.

277
01:07:23,929 --> 01:07:36,650
Thanks for the huge money. Throw away 985. Thank you so much. They say, hey,

278
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:42,010
Jerma have bits. I'm not letting the government have this money. Chat are paid actors. Top

279
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:46,809
Donators are your gambling addiction fencing money. I know the truth. Stay safe and marry the McChicken

280
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:55,590
Queen already. Are you guys like paid actors? Is somebody you guys just get getting paid from

281
01:07:55,590 --> 01:08:00,630
somebody to come and like tell me that I can't get perfect every time. Somebody's gonna be paying you.

282
01:08:01,429 --> 01:08:13,000
It seems like too much work. Are they right? Wait, you guys aren't getting paid.

283
01:08:15,699 --> 01:08:28,100
Wait, are you getting paid? Who's getting paid? I'm not a livered shea.

284
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:37,560
Oh, let's see. Legendary memory. 286 Ka-ching. This is where I get another person. Wait,

285
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:45,859
confirm. So these are my slots. Hey, Kazzy. Thanks for the five subs, Kazzy. Five community subs.

286
01:08:46,420 --> 01:09:00,630
Just dropped him right now. Thank you. So should I get a tate pond? Normal. Pollution map.

287
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:19,380
Pateria meat. Okay, I can only do this. Create normal, a normal pat-a-pon. It's one meat,

288
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:38,859
one stone, and 12 dollars. Pio Pio. Pio Pio. Hard iron. Okay, tender meat. These extra large

289
01:09:38,859 --> 01:09:46,439
size pat-a-pons are great against knockback. Resistance gets cold but weak against fire.

290
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:54,819
Should I get another one? Should I just get two? Or should I get another yary pond?

291
01:09:55,619 --> 01:10:10,920
Should I just fill it up? Whoa. Is that your TV to game mode? I'm not on a TV.

292
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:23,939
It's always so funny going to somebody's house that had that shit where there was like a full

293
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:29,800
half second input delay and they didn't even know it existed. And you sit there and you grab

294
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:37,300
the controller or you try to do something, you're like, holy shit. And then you change it and they're

295
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:44,090
like, what did you do? This doesn't feel right anymore. What the fuck? It's like, dude, you have...

296
01:10:44,090 --> 01:11:00,550
Okay, let's get another one. Here we go. We're going to plant another person. Here they come.

297
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:12,500
Okay, let's do another one. I got money, right? Wait, what's this? Oh, it's it.

298
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:20,539
So I have three yary ponds and three pat-a-pons. Should I just fill it up?

299
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:37,909
No stones. Oh, I don't have any more stones. Shit. Yeah, well, I have three guys now.

300
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,220
Master will surely be of use to you. Mater, whatever it is.

301
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:57,270
I got like, can I... Look at all this stuff. New shields. All right, I got some new stuff.

302
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:05,340
I got to look. All right, well, here we are. Carmen fortress. Did you use the tree of life

303
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:09,739
to befriend some tatypons? Time has come to rally the pat-a-pons and head out for earthen.

304
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:28,460
All right, so where's my... Where's my tatypons? Oh, right. There they are. What do they got?

305
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:40,500
Optimize. Whoa. Friendship sword, wooden helm, and friendship shield. Steel shield.

306
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:52,729
Pin axe. What's a friendship sword do? Oh, raise HP. Is HP at now 300 versus 200? That's pretty good.

307
01:12:53,689 --> 01:13:09,670
Okay. What about you guys? Optimize. It always takes the hat off. What about you? Optimize. Glass.

308
01:13:10,789 --> 01:13:19,180
Evolve to yary pond. Evolve to tatypon. Special move. Energy... Hold on. The iron fist causes

309
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:25,189
damage over a wide area. Effective against enemy structures and any enemy nearby. Energy field.

310
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:29,109
Surround all pat-a-pons in an impermeable protective shield. A major drawback is that

311
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:37,750
the shield will limit the troops' attack abilities. Dammit. Iron fist. Let's do this one. Does it work?

312
01:13:39,319 --> 01:14:02,390
Evolve to yary pond. He already is a yary pond. Oh. All right. Let's move out. Shuba duba doo.

313
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:31,000
Here we go. The pat-a-pons are here. One, two, three, four. How do you do his move?

314
01:14:31,960 --> 01:16:07,350
Oops. Get off. All right. Now attack. I forgot it. The coins. Bow. Bow and arrow guy. Go forward.

315
01:16:07,989 --> 01:18:23,460
Here we go. You're not a gamer. Forward. Forward. And... I think Carmen? Forward. I don't understand.

316
01:18:24,739 --> 01:18:40,010
Oh, this is not correct. None of your commands are on beat. That doesn't make any sense.

317
01:18:40,970 --> 01:19:43,260
Somebody said it's getting old, chat. Well, just leave him. Oh. Two consecutive beats takes it. Oh,

318
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:57,159
okay. All right. Sorry, sweetie. The PS4 remaster has a slight audio delay. That's why it's not

319
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:02,039
on beat. You notice that sometimes the pat-a-pons sound different. That means it's on beat.

320
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:21,859
Wait, the PS4 remaster has an audio delay? Am I being lied to? It's real. It's true? As a germ...

321
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:39,750
I'm seeing a lot of one guy say it's real. Oh, who cares? It is real. Google it. What? What?

322
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:47,529
Pat-a-pon 2 remaster audio delay? Why did I put... I put an ex... I put like a... I asked a question.

323
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:59,689
Ironically, the first pat-a-pon remaster also had this delay issue and it hasn't been fixed

324
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:04,069
despite pat-a-pon 2 remaster launching nearly three years later. You'll need to play with

325
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:08,949
headphones to eliminate the sound lag that's introduced between the controller and the TV.

326
01:21:08,949 --> 01:21:29,829
What? This shit is real. Wait, what? Oh, no. This is bad. It's pulling through a capture card,

327
01:21:29,829 --> 01:21:37,350
so it's always going to be bad. It's always going to be fucked up. I don't think I'm ever going to

328
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:48,300
get it right. It didn't fix the input delay for pat-a-pon 2. Hold on. It was unplayable in the

329
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,899
first pat-a-pon on PS4. And to be honest, it's a little better on this one. We still have to

330
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:56,220
really be sharp when playing the songs. I was expecting some kind of calibration system like

331
01:21:56,220 --> 01:22:01,500
in Guitar Hero. The real problem is the controller has a big input delay because of the wireless that

332
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,859
happens to almost any Bluetooth device. Try watching a movie on a Bluetooth speaker.

333
01:22:07,899 --> 01:22:16,500
Wait, what? I tried playing with a metronome at 120 beats per minute, which is the beat of pat-a-pon.

334
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:37,289
Metronome. 120 beats per minute? Is this going to work? Let me see if I can... I

335
01:22:37,289 --> 01:22:43,930
can't hear both of them at the same time though. Why are you playing on the capture card? Do you

336
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:55,960
have any idea how streaming works? Do I have to actually answer this? Wait, how do you think you're

337
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:29,340
seeing the video game? I'm using telepathy to give you this on the screen? I'm delayed by 650

338
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:33,829
milliseconds because I'm going through the capture card. Yeah, this is not going to work because I

339
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:39,899
have to delay this by 650 milliseconds for you to even hear it. All right, so just do it earlier

340
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:49,880
is what the goal is. This proves I apparently have to hit it like a quarter of a second earlier than I

341
01:23:49,880 --> 01:24:10,180
am. Later? Let me try that theory. Do it earlier. Let's just try this out. Let's just go to like

342
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:16,420
fucking level one. See, I'm just going to level one. Let me get this right. Okay, let's deploy.

343
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:41,770
Set it to easy? Hold on. Let's just see. Just do easy mode. So earlier. Later?

344
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:33,510
So it's slower? Okay, hold on. No. Okay, here's how I'm doing it. No, it's not working. Nevermind.

345
01:25:34,149 --> 01:26:07,560
It's slower. What the hell are you saying? It makes no sense. It would be delayed for us a .u.

346
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:13,159
Uh, will you hear what we just talked about? Oh, this is like a game issue.

347
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:49,420
You, we all welcome. Hi. Let me, I wish I could hear this. It's playable. It's just you stressing

348
01:26:49,420 --> 01:27:00,699
over nothing. Yeah, I kind of don't give a shit. I'm just gonna play the game. I'm just gonna play

349
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:10,069
like whatever. Who cares? I'm not gonna, it's not gonna be perfect. It's not gonna be perfect.

350
01:27:10,789 --> 01:27:23,220
Game was remastered like shit. What do you want me to say? Okay, wait, wait, wait. I can make other

351
01:27:23,220 --> 01:28:07,560
characters. There, yes. How much do they cost? Okay, I can make another one. Here they come.

352
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:41,779
Here it comes. Do you not split? I'm not. I play on a monitor. I capture it through OBS and I'm

353
01:28:41,779 --> 01:29:05,029
playing the game captured on my monitor. I'm not playing on the OBS window. Turn the volume up and

354
01:29:05,029 --> 01:29:19,050
then down. I'm going to play the game. What are you talking about? Oh, shit. That's cool.

355
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:40,500
One, two, three.

356
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:50,250
What? Where is he?

357
01:30:14,680 --> 01:31:28,090
Is that like a boss? I got this little tower. Get that gore. All right, go for it. All right, now go in.

358
01:31:28,090 --> 01:32:24,539
Okay. Walk. The fire is killing us. Walk. I'm a gamer. What? Get in. Oh, shit. I'm destroyed.

359
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,699
Oh, shit. I'm fucking dead.

360
01:32:31,859 --> 01:33:11,180
Keep going. I'm trying. They got a lot more people than I do. I don't get it, man. I got to like,

361
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:27,539
I don't know.

362
01:33:37,699 --> 01:34:08,180
You guys are not even very good. I'm losing too many people. All right, now go forward.

363
01:34:08,180 --> 01:35:52,710
This game, I'm tired of dancing. Oh, I'm trying to do it later. Oh, I got pulled the line.

364
01:35:54,550 --> 01:36:47,720
What happens when Jerma smokes DMT? What? I only got like two guys left. I'm dead. Maybe not. Oh,

365
01:36:47,720 --> 01:38:11,159
he's dead. All right, go in. No, fuck. Protect that guy. Do something. Go. Do it. Yeah.

366
01:38:26,920 --> 01:39:10,520
Many casualties. Hey, I still won. The Zigotan hero, Gong the Hawkeye, appeared as the Patapon's

367
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:15,750
rival in the first game. Spoilers. Thanks a lot. He fought for the Zigotan queen,

368
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:24,310
Karma, to stop the Patapon's invasion of his land. He went two to two against the Patapons,

369
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:39,699
but they fucking killed him. What if it burns one's eyes? Our scouts have looked at a giant

370
01:39:39,699 --> 01:39:46,439
monchichi on the Sutton Plains. Gong might be a problem, but Medan will be way whatever.

371
01:39:47,399 --> 01:40:10,579
I want to make a new guy. I need a bone. Shit. Plumps of grass. Okay. This guy drops bones.

372
01:40:12,649 --> 01:40:25,020
Wait, should I go in here? Can I make other units? How many people can you have in one squad?

373
01:40:25,819 --> 01:40:41,819
Oh, I can make these. Wait, hold on. I can make a Pio Pio. Should I make a Pio Pio?

374
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:53,210
This is against cold chills. There's a lot of fire units. I feel like it's probably better to make

375
01:40:53,210 --> 01:41:22,170
another one. Maybe another Patapon. I'm gonna make another Patapon. Go look at the crew. Build

376
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:47,779
the squads out first. Yeah. What is this? Oh, we almost got a full squad. Steel helm, steel helm.

377
01:41:48,579 --> 01:42:06,329
Still have wooden spears. What the fuck is this bullshit? Friendship bow, iron bow. Does the iron

378
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:14,810
bow do more damage? No, it does not. Am I not upgrading? I don't know. Should I save the

379
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:24,329
resources or should I just start upgrading people? Let's go like Yarra Pond. I can do this, but I

380
01:42:24,329 --> 01:42:32,390
can't do this one. What about the other guys? Like what are these dudes? Yeah, I'm on a full squad

381
01:42:32,390 --> 01:43:03,210
first. Can I afford another one of these here? No. So now I got six six. I wonder if this will be

382
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:20,550
good. Let's see if this works. Game lags after I open a menu. This game's just full of problems

383
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:34,760
tonight, huh? What about you? Do you still have stuff? What can you do? Friendship spear, friendship

384
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:45,159
helm. What's this? Oh, the hairpiece. No. This is so much. I have so many more units. Let's do it.

385
01:43:45,720 --> 01:44:03,850
Let's go. This is going to be the only Patapon stream. You don't know that yet.

386
01:44:04,569 --> 01:44:31,430
Bad guys. Oh, shit. I've killed you. Holy shit. All right. Defend. No, never mind.

387
01:44:36,039 --> 01:46:17,819
Phone. Get in there. Even go in. What? Just beat him. Is this the only Patapon 2 streamer?

388
01:46:18,779 --> 01:46:43,899
I don't know. I like this game. This game's fucking really, really fun. I really like it.

389
01:46:44,859 --> 01:47:16,220
It's very fun. If I have to deal with a bad port, I'll deal with a bad port. It's still fun.

390
01:47:17,100 --> 01:48:06,840
I still like it. It isn't a bad port. Imagine playing this on a cartridge. He won't emulate

391
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:14,819
I don't know. I don't know a DS emulator. I don't know where the fuck we can get one of those.

392
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:35,220
PSP emulator. Look, when I bought the remaster, how was I supposed to know there was like audio

393
01:48:35,220 --> 01:50:08,100
input problems? How am I supposed to know that? Can I even kill this thing? It's running.

394
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:47,220
Easy. I will. I will after this. Do I have to negate some of the grinding? Is that what it does?

395
01:51:08,300 --> 01:52:16,600
Jesus. Kill. Block. I got like a rare bone. Monster hunter.

396
01:52:18,359 --> 01:52:31,750
Block. I thought he was going to wait a turn. He's going back. He's backing up.

397
01:52:32,470 --> 01:53:20,060
All right. Block. Block. I got him. He's playing on hard. Isn't this on normal?

398
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:39,739
I got it.

399
01:53:39,739 --> 01:53:43,659
Possible lose their stance and easily stagger once their HP is low.

400
01:53:43,659 --> 01:53:47,699
If an item has dizzy staggered bosses have a tendency to drop items.

401
01:53:47,699 --> 01:54:00,579
Is that where I got the red one from? I got a red item. All right. Let's see. I want to see what I

402
01:54:00,579 --> 01:54:09,300
got. Dodeca bone. A large bone from the carcass of a large beast. These huge bones are often

403
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:25,029
used in the central pillars in homes. How do I put this on easy? Will that actually help with the

404
01:54:25,029 --> 01:54:51,260
input stuff? Back to the title screen. Let's go back to the title screen. Levels like normal.

405
01:54:55,189 --> 01:55:07,720
All right. Wait, speak. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's a documented issue.

406
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:12,520
You can't look at that and make fun of me. It's not fair. It's a documented issue.

407
01:55:13,159 --> 01:55:34,119
Should I try the headphones thing? Headphones. Let me see if that helps.

408
01:55:43,800 --> 01:56:02,039
Let's test it because maybe it was on speakers and maybe that's fucked up. I don't know.

409
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:34,699
It didn't save. Yeah, it did. Here we go. Ready? Same exact problem.

410
01:56:36,539 --> 01:56:42,899
I have both headphones in. Let me try it. Let's put it on easy and see what happens.

411
01:56:47,770 --> 01:57:01,340
He failed. Yeah. Sometimes you fail. What the fuck do I care?

412
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:24,659
All right. Here we go. I did get some new stuff, though. Hold on.

413
01:57:25,619 --> 01:57:34,659
Friendship sword. I didn't get anything else. Wooden helm.

414
01:57:35,619 --> 01:57:38,569
What do you got? Do one of you guys in the middle put the hair on?

415
01:57:42,939 --> 01:57:48,500
I've got a bunch of materials. Can I not? Do I have to craft them or something?

416
01:57:56,359 --> 01:58:18,180
No bullies, please. Let's see. What can I do? Level two. Two more stones and two more fangs.

417
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:26,439
Hey, Ben, thanks for the five community subs. Ben Elnor. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

418
01:58:27,319 --> 01:58:35,180
Thank you, Ben. Upgrade the hero. How do you upgrade the hero?

419
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:55,350
Oh, we can do this now, right? Heroes inherit upgrades from anyone in the class. Oh, okay.

420
01:58:56,149 --> 01:59:02,939
Questions eight. Should I go for this? Do I? I hope I don't lose out on this.

421
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:21,189
Don't waste your time with this. Change the egg. Change the egg. All right. Level two.

422
01:59:22,069 --> 01:59:28,779
Mysterious egg that leads you to battle with Chichi. Grants gas hanger his power.

423
01:59:29,659 --> 02:00:16,970
That's right. This is how you get better masks. All right. What's going on? Okay, I get it.

424
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:49,180
I'm like, I don't think it matters. No, it doesn't matter. This mode is always in normal.

425
02:00:51,260 --> 02:01:38,810
Oh, okay. I thought he was going to attack. Yep. No.

426
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:05,939
Let's see what happens on easy if it fixes the issue.

427
02:02:06,979 --> 02:02:35,300
It's emulated. Go ahead and get it on PSP. Failed. Wait, what? How? I was walking forward.

428
02:02:38,779 --> 02:02:47,609
Read. I was too busy getting angry at the fact that the input works now.

429
02:02:47,609 --> 02:03:09,930
How do you fail a cut scene? I'm not even looking at the screen. All right. Listen up.

430
02:03:22,069 --> 02:03:57,159
Oh, it was failing for views. All right. Let's get perfect literally every fucking single time

431
02:03:57,159 --> 02:04:01,800
I do this now. This window is a little bigger. This fixes the goddamn... I'm not going to get

432
02:04:01,800 --> 02:05:52,739
angry about this. Let's go. Get in there. Get that thing. Kill it. Kill. Whoa. What was that?

433
02:05:55,859 --> 02:06:07,449
It just gave me a new thing to do. Wait, what? Can I do it now?

434
02:06:10,859 --> 02:06:16,890
I have to do it while it happens. Wait, I have to do it when that pops up.

435
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:48,699
I thought it was like teaching me a new move. Yeah, I want to get the resource.

436
02:06:49,819 --> 02:07:21,800
This is way... The window is way better now. Let's do it again. You know they have X or

437
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:35,189
circle or whatever. So the idea is you grind out levels to get materials to make you guys better

438
02:07:35,189 --> 02:07:39,109
to do the later level. Okay, I get it. All right. This time I got to do the beat that pops up on

439
02:07:39,109 --> 02:09:00,489
that scroll. Forward. Where's that crab? Here we go. Okay. Here it comes. How do I do that?

440
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:20,069
Be closer? Square, triangle, square. It's not working. Square, triangle, square. What?

441
02:09:20,949 --> 02:09:46,100
When I hit triangle, it says no. Press it. I did. Fail the rhythm. That's normal. Wait,

442
02:09:46,100 --> 02:10:06,789
did I do it? I don't need to do it with the rhythm. I thought I had to do it with the rhythm.

443
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:28,359
I got too close to the totem. Cancel's combos would just do it.

444
02:10:30,840 --> 02:11:11,909
I guess I'm gonna do it again. I need the materials anyway. Okay, so...

445
02:11:13,109 --> 02:11:21,050
Okay, so when I see that pole to the beat, just do it. It doesn't matter. Even if it doesn't do

446
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:32,170
anything, just have to press it to the rhythm. I feel like I was trying to do that, but even if

447
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:47,899
they go, uh-oh, like, yo, that was wrong, just do it. It's not a real command. It's a pad upon.

448
02:11:47,899 --> 02:12:03,720
Just push through and keep on beat. Oh, okay. I'll try it again. Do it as soon as you see the totem.

449
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:41,859
Do it four times in a row. Okay. Forward, forward, forward, forward. Where's that pole?

450
02:12:41,859 --> 02:13:01,220
Forward, forward, forward. Where's that pole? I can't see what it said.

451
02:13:08,279 --> 02:13:13,699
Square, triangle, what is it? Square, triangle, square, triangle.

452
02:13:18,739 --> 02:13:46,170
What? I have to be closer? I thought it didn't matter. Okay. Oh, fucking god damn it.

453
02:14:05,779 --> 02:15:18,600
Thanks for the key. Bye. This game's confusing my cat. What is your cat watching?

454
02:15:19,399 --> 02:15:26,310
Why is he kept watching? He should be sleeping and eating like cat food.

455
02:15:27,829 --> 02:16:01,619
They're too close to the screen. Tell him to back up. A ching are golden coins that shine

456
02:16:01,619 --> 02:16:04,899
like newborn stars. Their glimmer of energy come from the life force they possess. Wow.

457
02:16:05,779 --> 02:16:08,680
Each coin is a pad upon's life energy, so it's a soul.

458
02:16:13,029 --> 02:16:21,479
Life coins. Uh, Ben coming in with five more community subs. Thanks, Ben. Another five from

459
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:35,110
Ben. Thank you fucking Ben Elnor. Thanks a lot, dude. Let's get more. More critters. More creatures.

460
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:58,840
Yeah. Wait, can I do more? He's demanding more money. More. I demand more. In the game,

461
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:09,270
of course. Okay, so now I have the thing. Let's go. Everybody's nice and locked and loaded.

462
02:17:09,909 --> 02:17:19,700
How about you guys? Optimize. Yes. Okay. Go beat the shit out of this guy.

463
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:55,739
Whip it, you fool. What? Wait, that's not just like a key item? Okay. Who holds it? You?

464
02:18:02,729 --> 02:18:24,569
Oh. Goes into the slot over here. Okay. $100 in bits from Vilemi. Thanks for the 10,000 bits,

465
02:18:24,569 --> 02:18:31,370
Vilemi. That's fucking crazy. Thank you for the- it's a lot of money. It's a lot of money to give

466
02:18:31,370 --> 02:18:36,500
somebody. Thank you. Jeremiah, I only have so much money to give you. Don't give any more.

467
02:18:37,139 --> 02:18:43,739
Keep it for you. It's your money and you need it now. Don't worry about giving me money. You've

468
02:18:43,739 --> 02:18:51,670
given me an insane amount of money. Don't worry about that. Thank you for the huge, huge drop.

469
02:18:52,309 --> 02:19:19,530
$877 cash now. $877 cash now. You have an annuity and you need cash now. $877 cash now. $877 cash

470
02:19:19,530 --> 02:19:39,340
now. It's- it helps. It's 120 beats per minute. Wait, here's the- don don do don.

471
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:57,430
Oh, great Patapon, can you hear me? Your eyeball army will melt if they continue to

472
02:19:57,430 --> 02:20:07,930
trap these barren lands without some juju. They'll first turn to black puddles and then

473
02:20:07,930 --> 02:20:11,450
evaporate. Use your juju powers. I'll give you a quick lesson on how to use the secrets of the

474
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:17,299
rain juju. In order to get your juju going, we first need to reach fever mode. Okay. Yes.

475
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:25,379
Once you enter in fever, hit x, x, x, x, x, don, do don, do don. When the juju dance begins,

476
02:20:25,379 --> 02:20:30,309
listen carefully to the Patapon song and hit the drum to the rhythm. Okay. We need to do-

477
02:20:30,309 --> 02:20:34,629
I have to be in preview.

478
02:21:29,819 --> 02:21:33,020
You did it. Rain will help you cool off and it also has other secret property. Use it to

479
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:55,530
flush out Centura, a beast only visible when it rains. Okay, this is the beast.

480
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:31,180
Good job, Patathons. Play the game in mute mode.

481
02:22:33,979 --> 02:22:39,620
Sorry, a fucking ghost just came out of me. I had to put it in a bottle.

482
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:52,889
I just had to spit it into a bottle. Ice shield. Wind currents will always affect your defense,

483
02:22:52,889 --> 02:22:56,889
attack, and hunting strategies. It should always factor in the direction when planning your

484
02:22:56,889 --> 02:23:02,790
adventures. This is- wait, this is- was it golf? All it takes is a careful eye and you'll notice

485
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:08,389
the change in wind direction. Sometimes it will blow left, stop, and then blow right. Do you

486
02:23:08,389 --> 02:23:21,290
notice the pattern? Is that- oh, there's a wind? Nice golf reference.

487
02:23:24,889 --> 02:23:28,739
Patathons report an invisible monster in the bouyayan basin.

488
02:23:29,930 --> 02:23:34,409
Great, Jerry. Could this be the Centura creature? It's time to put the rain juju to good use.

489
02:23:35,290 --> 02:23:54,229
Should I level- no. Fill it up. Where can I get fangs?

490
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:02,729
Be shaved down to use as a weapon. I guess I gotta go hunting.

491
02:24:03,450 --> 02:24:16,700
One more level two. Sorry, I'm gonna go hunting for level two. I'm gonna go get fangs.

492
02:24:17,500 --> 02:24:29,700
That sounds like a good idea. Centura drops fangs. Oh, okay. Wicked axe.

493
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:53,739
Okay, we need to use the gong. All right, here we go. Everybody's optimized. Ice.

494
02:24:53,739 --> 02:24:57,959
Ooh, what'd you get? What's that? Ice shield. Oh, wait, wait, somebody has an ice shield.

495
02:24:57,959 --> 02:25:02,389
Well, I want to see what it does. Counter- counteracts flame attacks.

496
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:27,030
Nice. Should I give friendship spear and the shuba? Let's go. Is there any reason why you're

497
02:25:27,030 --> 02:25:33,590
starting at midnight EU? Because I live in the United States of America on the west coast all

498
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:52,739
the way at the end. You live in Alaska? That's not the end. That's a different- that's up in Canada.

499
02:25:53,610 --> 02:26:12,500
We just like- we just like stole it one day. Okay, ready? It's time to do it.

500
02:26:16,329 --> 02:26:57,450
Wind. Heed my call. All right, now is it gonna rain? All right, now we

501
02:26:58,489 --> 02:27:33,430
go in there, right? Attack. All right, let's go. Block. Get in there. Defend. Yeah. Say it.

502
02:27:34,629 --> 02:27:42,229
That's not a giant. That's a- that's like a slug coming up. I can't- that's hard. I have to

503
02:27:42,229 --> 02:28:02,780
pay attention. Sorry, I can't. Get in there. Yes. Okay, guys, I got one core. Okay, this core

504
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:27,750
is like 12 gigahertz, but it can only do one task. You guys got like dual and quad cores.

505
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:38,440
Not me. I got one fucking core that just has a lot of computational power. And that's it.

506
02:28:52,069 --> 02:28:59,270
I can't- I can't. Streamer has a pre-built brain. Don't.

507
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:34,629
Pre-built. That's fucking hilarious. Oops, I screwed it up. Okay, if you had one-

508
02:29:35,829 --> 02:29:49,219
oh, the computer hung up for a second. I opened up Firefox. Okay. Oh, it's- hold on, hold on.

509
02:29:49,219 --> 02:30:13,000
Come on. Get over here. Attack. And this is where we go. Defend, defend. Do it. Defend.

510
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:20,819
Defend. Do it. Defend. Attack. Attack. Attack. Attack.

511
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:33,000
Put forward. March it forward. Let me see that. Defend. Defend. Put it on. Defend.

512
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:43,959
Do it. Defend. Defend. Put it on. Defend. Attack. Force it. Attack. Force. Attack. Motherfucker.

513
02:30:44,440 --> 02:31:06,860
Motherfucker. I did it wrong. One core. Fringe. Ban that person for life. Give me that. Give me

514
02:31:06,860 --> 02:31:45,829
that. Get it. Okay, here comes the- defense. Put it on. Defense. Shut up. Pre-built brain.

515
02:31:49,959 --> 02:32:09,559
And I'm way too expensive. I like like caviar and shit. I'm a pre-built PC.

516
02:32:19,290 --> 02:32:22,729
Like you could go to the- you could go to like McDonald's and get a dinner for-

517
02:32:22,729 --> 02:32:27,930
oh, I'm pre-built fucking single PCPU core brain. Yeah, there's a joke. I can't even do it.

518
02:32:27,930 --> 02:32:50,739
A single fucking PCPU brain. After the boss, I'll tell it. The wind is strong. Get in closer.

519
02:32:54,100 --> 02:33:16,069
Wait. He's dead. And I got an egg. I can't believe I got an egg. All right. So what was I saying?

520
02:33:16,069 --> 02:33:20,069
Oh, yeah. Okay. You can get like- you can go buy like a- you could go get like a bologna

521
02:33:20,069 --> 02:33:25,750
and cheese sandwich from the fucking grocery store. But I go and get a fucking bologna and

522
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:28,870
cheese sandwich from like this expensive restaurant. It's the same exact thing,

523
02:33:28,870 --> 02:33:43,989
but I pay $400 for it. And by the way, I'm from outer space. I fly around in a spaceship in outer

524
02:33:43,989 --> 02:33:53,270
space. That makes me some kind of a creature and an outer space being. And I like to wear clothes.

525
02:33:53,750 --> 02:34:02,170
I like to put on clothes. I like to put on clothes. I like to put them on. I like to put them on.

526
02:34:03,049 --> 02:34:39,030
XL size Patapods. The face cam has been on the whole time. Good. I hope you saw my fucking-

527
02:34:40,629 --> 02:34:46,299
Okay. I'm going to turn it back. Maybe I should get a

528
02:34:46,940 --> 02:35:05,459
Bioko. Can I get an extra large Bioko? I'm going to get one. I'm going to evolve into a Bioko.

529
02:35:05,459 --> 02:35:15,670
Not for an archer. Oh yeah. One of these guys. A shield Bioko. Do I do a level two Bioko?

530
02:35:16,469 --> 02:35:54,600
Dude, let's just make a level two Bioko. Nice. Holy shit. This game. Good. Whoa. Do another level one.

531
02:35:55,799 --> 02:36:03,819
Do another level one Bioko. Holy shit. All right. Let's do another level one Bioko.

532
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:19,739
An archer. Cool. All right. Cool. And then I can make stuff.

533
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:26,280
Battle at Mount Gonroth. I worry your spirit is more important than orders. My ancestors

534
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:30,520
would be ashamed if I never crossed swords with you. What does that even mean? This game is

535
02:36:30,520 --> 02:37:06,709
fucking terrible. What the fuck, dude? I'm just fucking kidding this guy. You think I would still

536
02:37:06,709 --> 02:37:13,190
play this if I didn't think it was fun? Didn't I get another one of these guys?

537
02:37:19,190 --> 02:37:30,809
Evolve to Yummy Pond. Blazing fast volley of arrows. Yeah. Wooden bow. Excuse me. We need to take a bow

538
02:37:30,809 --> 02:37:39,290
from one of you guys. Give me this good one. Fire bow. Excuse me. You can take a fucking

539
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:54,809
goddamn wooden bow. Give that to the leader. Played gotcha for us. I was just kidding.

540
02:37:55,530 --> 02:38:04,620
I did that because I was just making you have a reaction. Hey, you guys do it to me all the time.

541
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:18,700
I can't do it back. Here we go. Long is not our enemy. Our real opponents are those masked fools.

542
02:38:23,110 --> 02:38:32,489
No, damn it, Pond. Urk. Oh, I've been waiting for you, Supreme Patapon.

543
02:38:33,690 --> 02:38:37,350
You can't even beat me. You won't have a chance of beating them.

544
02:38:38,790 --> 02:38:51,370
Prove your might. Give me all you got. Eye of the tiger. Okay, fine. Fine. Let's eat this shit.

545
02:38:52,979 --> 02:39:32,229
Rain song. It's already raining. So now we'll get on their eyes and shit. Two rain. Double rain.

546
02:39:44,299 --> 02:40:19,459
Get in there. Only offense. No defense. No. Volley. Volley. It worked. I got rid of the lightning.

547
02:40:19,459 --> 02:41:03,319
Did it work? Get him. We're good. I guess I get six. That guy just got... Okay, I was gonna say.

548
02:41:03,319 --> 02:41:23,639
Forward. Forward. Forward. Get in there. Now... Oops, I was... Why did I look at chat? I don't know why.

549
02:41:26,969 --> 02:42:38,629
Peace out. Get in. Defend. Defend. Get in there. Defend. Again. Good. Come on. Get the guys in the back.

550
02:42:40,489 --> 02:43:11,979
Attack. Kill them. Forward. Forward. Forward again. Attack. Yes.

551
02:43:11,979 --> 02:43:23,459
Yes. Oh, hero sucks. It's all right. He's doing okay. What's that? A surprise attack?

552
02:43:25,879 --> 02:43:47,510
Who's doing this? What? What? Who's winning? Won't cause you any more trouble.

553
02:43:48,149 --> 02:43:50,069
If you wish to learn the truth, just look at the skies.

554
02:43:53,079 --> 02:44:08,840
Oh, I thought you said... You can't do a timeout. What? I can't believe you guys used a timeout.

555
02:44:09,559 --> 02:44:56,200
I got a lot of stuff. All right. Get in there. World ruler. That's me. Defend.

556
02:45:11,350 --> 02:45:40,409
Iron helm. Get the lightning off. Oh, you mean...

557
02:46:23,079 --> 02:46:46,309
Man, that person for a year. Stop. Oh, no. What's going on?

558
02:46:48,139 --> 02:47:22,250
Hold on. I need a break. I need a break. Mommy, I need a break. You know, the problem is

559
02:47:23,049 --> 02:47:30,500
it's really dark in my room right now. It's getting dark out. The light's not on. Hammers.

560
02:47:31,700 --> 02:48:06,020
Like, look. I can't think because it's dark. Well, it's really dark.

561
02:48:16,219 --> 02:48:42,149
Just look at how dark it is. It's fucking dark in here. All right. I'm going to go take a piss.

562
02:48:42,149 --> 02:51:01,159
I'll be right back. I have returned. I'm ready to play more Patapon.

563
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:36,870
Yeah, I know. It's a scary image. Okay. What do you want me to tell you? It's a scary face. Yeah,

564
02:51:36,870 --> 02:51:54,420
I know. I got it. Mom, they're making me look bad. Mom, they're making me look bad.

565
02:51:54,420 --> 02:52:22,600
Call their parents. You have to call their parents now. All right. Let's go.

566
02:52:32,870 --> 02:52:41,180
Turn of resigns. Okay. Let's keep going. I didn't even turn the fucking light on.

567
02:52:49,879 --> 02:53:10,729
Shit. Have I ever eaten two pounds of yogurt in one sitting? I don't think that this is an

568
02:53:10,729 --> 02:53:16,889
odd thing to admit. I didn't think so. All right. Let's go. The real threat of the Carmen. It's not

569
02:53:16,889 --> 02:53:28,860
just a dirty way of doing things. It's hard to forgive. Ace opponent for eternity. I'm going to

570
02:53:28,860 --> 02:53:40,899
play these guys. Should I make this? The guys with the spears, should they make them bigger?

571
02:53:40,899 --> 02:53:56,489
Pick up, make up. Yo, yo, get up. Yo, yo. I need things for that. That was just,

572
02:53:56,489 --> 02:53:58,569
it was incredibly satisfying. Had to watch the whole thing.

573
02:53:59,530 --> 02:54:13,540
Build the, kill Centura again. Ooh, that's not a bad idea. Yeah. Let's go kill that character again.

574
02:54:21,399 --> 02:54:36,260
I love that sword. Yes. All some more level two. I was going to scream. I guess

575
02:54:36,979 --> 02:54:53,670
let's go. Let's just go kill Centura. What's my millionaire streamer up to today? Oh, you know,

576
02:54:53,670 --> 02:55:08,409
withdrawing a thousand dollars from the bank in ones and counting it. I knew it.

577
02:55:09,610 --> 02:55:40,329
Why would you ever do something like that? I don't know. Why would you? You wouldn't.

578
02:55:41,049 --> 02:55:48,420
Yeah.

579
02:55:48,420 --> 02:55:58,600
Germa sucks. Thanks for the five community subs. Thanks for the sub. And get in.

580
02:56:51,700 --> 02:57:22,459
It is actually very fun. A blocker. It really is Monster Hunter, isn't it?

581
02:57:23,420 --> 02:57:29,510
Oh, just with a bunch of little guys.

582
02:57:42,170 --> 02:57:53,780
Oh, is that a golden fang? Yeah.

583
02:57:56,440 --> 02:58:33,459
Hooray. Second highest tier fang. Nice. Demon fang, huh? Cool. All right. So. Oh, what?

584
02:58:34,260 --> 02:58:59,159
Oh, I just shook the chills a little bit. I'm going to upgrade some of the bows.

585
02:59:01,319 --> 02:59:19,159
Still need a fang for you. Because big spear guy. Oh, I can. I can level it up too. Whoa,

586
02:59:19,159 --> 02:59:25,079
wait, I can make a Wanda. A rare pawn whose attack power increases gradually as he levels up. His

587
02:59:25,079 --> 02:59:42,620
stagger rate is 20 percent. He's easy to put to sleep. And then do Wanda level two. I think I'm

588
02:59:42,620 --> 02:59:55,659
going to do it. Wanda level two. What's down here? Whoa. Chig Yobi. This rare pawn's attack abilities

589
02:59:55,659 --> 03:00:01,420
like critical. Stagger and damage will increase as he levels up. It's critical. He's got 30% crit

590
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:36,680
resistance. Wanda two or rare pug? Three. Rare pawn. Is this a rare pawn? Oh, I'm doing it.

591
03:00:41,500 --> 03:01:05,479
Cool. Let's see. Top one unlocks a new unit. Well, we got a rare pawn. Go up. I'm going to go. Okay,

592
03:01:05,479 --> 03:01:08,360
two. I'm going to take. I'm going to make a Tata pawn. That's a Pio Pio.

593
03:01:09,159 --> 03:01:24,440
On Tama, rare pawn whose critical rate rises gradually as they level up. At level five,

594
03:01:24,440 --> 03:01:47,690
their attacks become very fast. I can do this like three times. Oh, ho ho. Level two. Yeah,

595
03:01:47,690 --> 03:02:08,379
I'm doing it. Level three. I did it. Cool. Okay, what about the archers? Maybe I should also do a

596
03:02:08,379 --> 03:02:21,530
go up and over there as well. The Pio Pio. Yeah, because that's good too. Critical strike on an

597
03:02:21,530 --> 03:02:46,360
archer. All right, that was cool. Squish. Squish what? Fortress. Edgey cliff.

598
03:02:47,399 --> 03:02:51,479
Tata pawns head into the skies above where another Carmen fortress stands before them. It's time for

599
03:02:51,479 --> 03:03:05,659
battle. All right, we got to move some people around, right? That you go over there. Level of

600
03:03:05,659 --> 03:03:16,200
you. You, not you. Over here. Optimize. Friendship sword, friendship shield.

601
03:03:20,920 --> 03:03:31,350
Optimize first. You're in the front. That's good. Optimize. You're in the front too. Okay, cool.

602
03:03:32,229 --> 03:03:53,370
Give it a try. Army looks beefy. Yeah. Oh, they're cold.

603
03:03:56,809 --> 03:04:33,350
So are they. I turn it into rain? All right, I'm going to make it rain instead. That'll work,

604
03:04:33,350 --> 03:05:03,479
right? Will it turn to rain? Yeah, it's um, then, then, then. Fucking God. Where's the beat?

605
03:05:04,280 --> 03:06:26,149
Where's the song? And forward. All right, forward. This song's good. I think it's so big.

606
03:06:42,229 --> 03:08:02,219
Fire made for a small screen. That makes sense. Here we go. Unbelievable. Forward.

607
03:08:02,860 --> 03:08:30,149
I'm not hitting myself with my own air hose, right? All right, knock the shit out.

608
03:08:31,270 --> 03:09:10,809
Now bend. What's the wind look like? Wake up! Jeremy, catapongs are attacking my apartment right

609
03:09:10,809 --> 03:09:54,709
now. I'm sorry, man. Like you're in that building. Man, that's, that's so funny. It is. That's funny.

610
03:09:55,590 --> 03:10:00,010
If you don't think so, then you need to go to comedy school. Like that person did.

611
03:10:01,129 --> 03:10:08,420
Okay, I went, but I, I, you know, whatever. I fucked out.

612
03:10:12,860 --> 03:10:19,139
Loud strange noises. It's not comedy. It's like, oh, really? You think so?

613
03:10:20,739 --> 03:10:37,350
He's so fucking smart, though. Aren't I funny?

614
03:10:37,350 --> 03:11:21,000
He flunked out. Rain again? Oh, more rain. How do you flunk out a clown college? You can't make

615
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:59,739
balloon animals. That's like the SATs of clowns. You got to be able to know how to do that. All

616
03:11:59,739 --> 03:12:28,329
right. I do need to do rain. I said the item's fine. It's going to be there. Currently in a

617
03:12:28,329 --> 03:12:39,739
clown one-on-one zoom call. Do you have to be in makeup for that? Or is it just like, you know

618
03:12:39,739 --> 03:12:52,940
what? We, no, we don't have to be in. We're just, we're just here. No more rain. No more fire.

619
03:12:54,139 --> 03:13:44,309
Not makeup. It's not makeup. What does that mean? Ink? Big walnut. Pick up the walnut.

620
03:13:45,110 --> 03:13:49,530
Yes. Okay. Don't. It's not analog. It doesn't do anything.

621
03:14:03,579 --> 03:14:31,940
People are born clowns or not. That's a lot of items. This game looks great. But was it really

622
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:56,790
worth $250? It was actually like seven bucks. Did you know that you can change here class

623
03:14:56,790 --> 03:15:02,180
at the headquarters? Oh, no, that's the guy's name. Do you know that you can change

624
03:15:02,979 --> 03:15:05,219
a class at the headquarters before you buy

625
03:15:20,940 --> 03:15:24,540
Oh, wait, we have to watch this when he buries it all.

626
03:15:32,229 --> 03:15:46,459
Oh, should I, uh, I'm getting some more, uh, yary pond upgrades. I can't. Oh, God, I'm died.

627
03:15:47,180 --> 03:16:20,629
All right. What am I supposed to say? I could go. I could do a little too. Cool. What about you?

628
03:16:24,229 --> 03:16:45,340
Yeah. Oh, I want this one. That's this one. A chiku. Nice. Okay. He's not my stuff.

629
03:16:46,219 --> 03:16:56,920
It's fun. Why does it get so crusty? I don't know. It just kind of does. It just does. Doesn't it?

630
03:17:01,110 --> 03:17:16,489
Crust is real. Can you change menus? Don't ask me why. Defender of the sky past the impregnable

631
03:17:16,489 --> 03:17:21,209
mountains. See if the clouds spreads before them. White clouds, black clouds, thunder clouds.

632
03:17:21,209 --> 03:17:38,489
But this isn't heaven. It's a battleground class. Uh, I'm going to make you a yary pond.

633
03:17:41,110 --> 03:17:59,750
Steel saber. Optimize. Optimize. Got them all hats. Optimize. Nice. Give hero the good one.

634
03:18:01,110 --> 03:18:11,139
Oh yeah. You, yeah. Give me this thing. Friendship spear. Get off. Friendship spear. Give it to me.

635
03:18:11,780 --> 03:18:38,659
Friendship sword. Okay. Let's go. Nothing like a good old friendship sword.

636
03:18:39,540 --> 03:18:56,659
Look out for that cloud monster. Okay. Pick him up. Lousy patapons.

637
03:19:00,219 --> 03:19:35,159
The hell is that? Is that it over there? Kill it. Fuck. Oh, can we back up? Holy shit.

638
03:19:43,180 --> 03:19:55,260
Right. Or a good hit. All right. Now block.

639
03:19:55,260 --> 03:20:35,659
Got it. Again. Okay. Again. For hours now. Yeah, me too. Is there a way to mute their voices?

640
03:20:38,299 --> 03:21:05,989
I don't think so. What? That's like a secret. Before it disappears. Get in there. No.

641
03:21:05,989 --> 03:22:39,610
No. Let's go. Just pick it up. I'm muted. I'm not muted. I'm not. I can see the indicator.

642
03:22:40,489 --> 03:23:09,350
The streamer can't even unmute. All right. Now five minute break from reading chat. I think

643
03:23:09,350 --> 03:23:40,059
that sounds good. No. Get that thing. I think it's like a staff. Get a staff. He's in the way.

644
03:23:41,420 --> 03:24:36,969
Get it. I can't walk by him. I can't walk by him. I can't move by him. I got an egg. My DPS is too

645
03:24:36,969 --> 03:25:09,899
low. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Security number.

646
03:25:14,709 --> 03:25:22,520
Why the hell would you put that in here? What's wrong with you? Patapons like to stay clean. So

647
03:25:22,520 --> 03:25:27,340
they'll run from the smelly game. They pass under an enemy bird. The bird might drop a poopoo on

648
03:25:27,340 --> 03:25:41,530
them, which would make any patapon upset. Make sure to keep them clean. Lady of the Den. You again,

649
03:25:41,530 --> 03:25:45,700
let me guess. The scouts have found something terrible. Right. Lady of the Den. How did you

650
03:25:45,700 --> 03:25:51,799
know? It's a castle up in the clouds. Oh, fuck. What the fuck are you talking about?

651
03:26:06,780 --> 03:26:23,079
Should I do one of the egg thing again? Sentura egg one. Maybe let's just do a,

652
03:26:23,079 --> 03:26:34,819
I'll do Sentura one. So who are these little guys that I just get them? This is my hero.

653
03:26:41,479 --> 03:26:51,030
You have to go over here. Oh, what the fuck is this? Formation.

654
03:26:53,940 --> 03:26:57,219
He appears on horseback riding with none. His form must be that of a true warrior.

655
03:26:57,860 --> 03:27:20,700
Oh, that's cool. Does he always have to be in the front? He's doing solo. Oh, this must be okay.

656
03:27:21,340 --> 03:27:30,620
Let's just go kill this thing. This is for multiplayer. How would multiplayer work in this

657
03:27:30,620 --> 03:28:20,440
game? You have to do it at the same time. Let's do it. Forgot. Not on the easy mode anymore.

658
03:28:21,079 --> 03:28:37,670
The four inputs don't work. Forgot. What the fuck? What is going on?

659
03:28:57,420 --> 03:29:55,690
Get the coins. What are you doing? That's what he does.

660
03:29:56,729 --> 03:30:44,860
Kill. Come on. Get those coins. Get in there. Get the coins. Is this on PSP? It is. It's being

661
03:30:44,860 --> 03:31:15,940
played on PlayStation 4 with the remake. Technically the remaster. That's true.

662
03:31:15,940 --> 03:31:50,139
Get it. Those coins. The remaster. Play everything on a CRTV. Oh, shit.

663
03:32:22,549 --> 03:33:22,229
Oh, great. I have no fucking idea. Yay. Who did I get? Who is that? Who is that?

664
03:33:27,879 --> 03:33:45,020
Pura Battle Egg. Spit off to Alita Battle Angel. Didn't do very well at the box-off.

665
03:33:49,379 --> 03:33:57,239
Disney lost 200 million dollars. Okay, so wait. Did I get the big one or get a bunch of the little

666
03:33:57,239 --> 03:34:20,340
ones? Take them all away. It's the funniest movie of the year. Let's move. Do you want to change

667
03:34:20,340 --> 03:34:36,579
Harachari into Pacheng and return? Yeah. Don't be honest. Did you get bogged? Is that why you

668
03:34:36,579 --> 03:35:00,040
don't go on biz anymore? Hey, dude. Hey, be honest. Did you get bogged? It didn't everybody

669
03:35:00,040 --> 03:35:15,799
did. What are you talking about? Did I get bogged? Every single person did. All of everyone. He

670
03:35:15,799 --> 03:35:25,290
admits it. It becomes a crypto rent. I mean, what do you have any more to say? Yes, I was

671
03:35:25,290 --> 03:35:33,370
responsible. And when BTC reached that $20,000, I was like, yep, it's time to sell it here. And

672
03:35:33,370 --> 03:35:38,819
this is a good idea. And I'm going to sell it. It went down. Just keep it. It's going to be the new

673
03:35:38,819 --> 03:35:46,729
paradigm. It's 14,000. Just hold on to it. We're going to get a big rally here. 8,000. I'm telling

674
03:35:48,170 --> 03:35:55,850
it's going to be the new technology everybody's going to use. What do you want me to say? You

675
03:35:55,930 --> 03:36:15,430
want to say? Oh, I'm responsible. And I took profits when I should have. Sky Castle of the

676
03:36:15,430 --> 03:36:35,190
gods. Oh, no, he's angry. He finally admits to getting bogged. Oh, level. Yep. He fell for a get

677
03:36:35,190 --> 03:36:48,409
rich quick scheme. No, I didn't. Because this is it's still like cryptographic technology. It's

678
03:36:48,409 --> 03:36:52,729
like a good technology. It's a good it's going to do some good things eventually here. All right.

679
03:36:53,690 --> 03:37:02,739
Everybody knows that. Come on. Cryptographic techno stuff. Keep telling yourself that.

680
03:37:03,459 --> 03:37:10,979
I don't have to keep telling myself that. It's even if it's not money. You know, there'll be a

681
03:37:10,979 --> 03:37:16,920
use for it. It'll be the thing that communicates in your car. The tell it to like turn its engine on.

682
03:37:17,639 --> 03:37:22,700
And like to be careful. Get all that self driving AI blockchain car. I don't know.

683
03:37:23,659 --> 03:37:26,059
Oh, let me have to get I have this. Can I have like a little bit of hope, please?

684
03:37:26,700 --> 03:37:44,659
I think I'm self driving blockchain car would take you'd be like, Okay, time to take a turn

685
03:37:44,659 --> 03:37:50,659
signal. All right, hold on. About to take a left. First, let me download every single left that's

686
03:37:50,659 --> 03:38:04,969
ever been taken by every single other car. Okay, almost got it. Okay, now it's time to put my left

687
03:38:04,969 --> 03:38:36,649
on the next one. Okay, I'm playing the game. I've made 1000s of dollars in crypto in the last month

688
03:38:36,649 --> 03:38:42,329
alone. I'm so I'm really happy for you. That's great. I that's fucking awesome. I'm really happy

689
03:38:42,329 --> 03:38:49,670
to hear that. It's gonna do something. It's it look it's like a new technology. Fucking pets.com

690
03:38:49,670 --> 03:38:55,750
came out and nobody gives a shit anymore. There'll be like an there'll be an Amazon of this of the

691
03:38:55,750 --> 03:39:00,229
crypto world be a few of them. Probably I don't know. I'm just optimistic. Okay, and I'm glad

692
03:39:00,229 --> 03:39:06,709
you're making some money. It's cold. Whatever. It's sure it is. Of course it is. What do you want me

693
03:39:06,709 --> 03:39:33,000
to pretend? He got absolutely bogged. He's delirious. How much money did you lose?

694
03:39:35,770 --> 03:39:39,450
Um, not enough to be sad, but enough to be annoyed. Let's put it that way.

695
03:39:56,180 --> 03:40:03,180
100k. If you think a slight annoyance would be from $100,000 in losses.

696
03:40:04,139 --> 03:40:08,739
Um, I how much money do you think I have?

697
03:40:09,620 --> 03:40:29,930
Bragging about being a millionaire again with like, what was that face?

698
03:40:31,370 --> 03:40:36,950
Dude, you're a millionaire. I'm gonna hiss into the mic. I'm gonna hiss into the mic.

699
03:40:38,309 --> 03:41:08,010
Oh, by the way, I got all the easy bake oven stuff. That's gonna be disgusting. I saw the

700
03:41:08,010 --> 03:41:13,180
packet for the pizza. I don't want to eat this pizza. It's gonna be fucking revolting.

701
03:41:15,340 --> 03:41:41,260
I've been making a pizza out of a powdered packet. That's what it is. Guys, even the

702
03:41:41,260 --> 03:41:48,459
Lunchables. Lunchables pizzas are cold and they're weird. They don't come out of like a powdered

703
03:41:48,459 --> 03:41:56,489
pouch. It's not, no, I don't even think it's flour. It's some alien liquid. I don't know.

704
03:41:59,049 --> 03:42:19,350
Wait, get that sword. Get that sword. Somebody touch it. Nice. Thunder sword.

705
03:42:22,010 --> 03:42:37,770
Huge fog moment. Pressing for those things.

706
03:42:40,090 --> 03:43:34,250
Shooting? We just came in and said veto. Um, you're about four hours too late. Annihilate.

707
03:43:41,540 --> 03:44:01,989
Can you move? What's about some other scams you can help with? Um, wait, that's applying that,

708
03:44:01,989 --> 03:44:14,549
that like, no, that's not a scam. Air restoration. That shit actually works.

709
03:44:16,229 --> 03:44:21,079
That stuff, it works if you do the right, if you do like surgery or whatever it is.

710
03:44:29,510 --> 03:44:34,139
Nobody can tell it's not my real hair. Nobody can tell it's not my real hair.

711
03:44:35,819 --> 03:44:42,579
Because I had a video of me in a pool coming up from under the water and my hair like goes

712
03:44:42,579 --> 03:44:59,940
back and just look at it. And I look into the camera and I go, it's my real hair.

713
03:45:00,500 --> 03:45:06,260
And I pretend to yank it and you can clearly tell that I'm not putting any pressure at all on it.

714
03:45:07,459 --> 03:45:10,180
I'm just like, I'm doing like a pantomime that I'm pulling.

715
03:45:13,370 --> 03:45:18,569
Why the fuck would I want to like compromise that this hair on TV commercial that I probably got

716
03:45:18,569 --> 03:45:44,469
paid like $300. Procedure was like 16 grand. Why would I compromise this? What are they saying?

717
03:45:46,309 --> 03:45:51,750
Oh, but this shit works. It works. That shit actually works.

718
03:45:57,620 --> 03:47:02,389
Okay, get in. Move closer. Show no mercy. Now the hint. Brain cells.

719
03:47:06,090 --> 03:47:11,530
Of the sounds and the colors. Pressing the same sequence of buttons over and over again.

720
03:47:11,690 --> 03:47:25,350
I don't like gamer fatigue. I know what that is.

721
03:47:26,790 --> 03:47:59,129
You're going to rock you. We dropped something. Go get this items.

722
03:48:01,610 --> 03:48:06,899
Can I get the items? How do I get the items? It's like a yellow item. I can't get it.

723
03:48:11,500 --> 03:48:24,860
How do I care about lore when there's items on the ground?

724
03:48:25,500 --> 03:48:53,420
3D Grinner. Okay, I want to see the new thunder bow. Cool.

725
03:48:53,420 --> 03:49:00,280
Somewhere in this world hides a dark place known as the underworld. The underworld has

726
03:49:00,280 --> 03:49:05,399
its own leader with demons and trolls as residents. They can't come to our world on their own,

727
03:49:05,399 --> 03:49:11,639
but all they need is a special summon to make the trip. Generic ass fucking story.

728
03:49:26,579 --> 03:49:33,590
I'm like this game a lot. Don't you know I say that? I said the same thing. I got to be careful

729
03:49:33,590 --> 03:49:40,069
because I did that with Mario Sunshine and I think I got to stop doing that. I got to stop

730
03:49:42,360 --> 03:49:48,620
shitposting on my own stream. I've done that a couple of times today. I'm going to stop

731
03:49:48,620 --> 03:50:01,930
shitposting on my own account. I don't like this. Why? Whoa, look at that hair.

732
03:50:23,450 --> 03:50:31,959
Go all the way to the left? I can't. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. Go left.

733
03:50:31,959 --> 03:50:48,840
There's nothing here. Wait, what do I mean? Call the guy with the hair?

734
03:50:52,139 --> 03:51:07,799
There's no more left. Call the guy with the hair. What is going on?

735
03:51:09,799 --> 03:51:35,610
There'll be something to the left soon. That was fun.

736
03:51:44,889 --> 03:51:47,690
Those pursuing earth end won't be stopped by a mere blizzard.

737
03:51:50,469 --> 03:52:01,540
No, we will not. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

738
03:52:01,540 --> 03:52:10,389
wait a minute. What's happening? Thunder sword. Magical sword that harnesses the power of thunder

739
03:52:10,389 --> 03:52:15,350
to deal critical staggers and knockbacks as well as set fires. I'm going to have to give that

740
03:52:16,309 --> 03:52:34,680
a gun from. Thunder bow, right? Yeah, there is. Stagger. There's frog. What's frog?

741
03:52:35,399 --> 03:52:46,659
To the hero. The hero is... I have to make the hero a different class, right? So then you take

742
03:52:46,659 --> 03:53:02,379
the full shield. I just killed everybody. Take this off. Put on this tin axe. Give me that ice shield

743
03:53:02,379 --> 03:53:28,840
too. An axe. Thunder sword. Friendship helm. Steel shield. Ice shield. Ice is better. I can

744
03:53:28,840 --> 03:54:08,180
make you a... Wait a minute. Five to thirty. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Putting your teeth together

745
03:54:08,180 --> 03:54:16,739
and that's better. Pairs of peaches. Neither of them. Throw them both in the trash and buy

746
03:54:16,739 --> 03:54:44,659
nectareans instead. They think they can really cross the snow field. I mean like theoretically

747
03:54:44,659 --> 03:55:13,270
throw them away. Actually throw them. That big sword. Anime darn these pataphons. Aiming.

748
03:55:17,139 --> 03:55:32,780
I got a chance to leave. Inhuman, those pataphons are monsters.

749
03:55:33,340 --> 03:56:26,329
Yeah, defend. You're killing them. Get that flame. Nice throw.

750
03:56:28,329 --> 03:56:37,819
Rain, dude. All right, I got it. It's a migraine scream. We're probably going to be getting those

751
03:56:37,819 --> 03:57:00,780
to the end soon. This is kind of turning into a migraine scream, isn't it? Is the rain ritual?

752
03:57:01,739 --> 03:57:29,860
I actually hate this game. Oh, I don't. The games are on the agenda. Well, No More Heroes 2 is on

753
03:57:30,819 --> 03:58:04,649
single core brain. Yeah, No More Heroes 2 is going to be on Monday? What day is it? I don't know.

754
03:58:04,649 --> 03:58:23,739
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. The idea would be No More Heroes 2 and that takes us

755
03:58:23,739 --> 03:58:32,870
from two screams and then we do Resident Evil 3. Can you hear me? Oh, sorry. No More Heroes 2,

756
03:58:32,870 --> 03:58:42,040
Monday, Tuesday, and then the idea is then to get that sword and then do Resident Evil 3

757
03:58:42,760 --> 03:58:53,139
on Wednesday, Thursday, if it takes that long. Resident Evil 3 takes one day,

758
03:58:53,139 --> 03:59:21,940
like, for instance, on Wednesday and it might take one day. Shit. When's Easy Bake?

759
03:59:21,940 --> 03:59:27,299
Easy Bake Oven Stream and the Green Screen DLC for Free Stream. It'll be back to back

760
03:59:28,979 --> 03:59:40,889
on May 15th and 16th. Back to back. Easy Bake Oven Stream will be probably Friday

761
03:59:42,760 --> 03:59:57,190
and the Green Screen DLC on Saturday. Am I permanently frozen here?

762
03:59:58,709 --> 04:00:30,709
Just move. Come on, guys. Game's so fun. All right. I got it. When are you going to do a

763
04:00:30,709 --> 04:00:38,489
cringe stream? Somebody could probably argue that that's every single one. I mean, I'm sure

764
04:00:38,489 --> 04:00:44,629
there's somebody that would be watching this. I don't like that. I mean, oh, I can't argue with

765
04:00:44,629 --> 04:01:18,780
that. Just kill them. I'm just going to do it defending only. The wind's too strong. Your hero

766
04:01:18,780 --> 04:01:41,670
makes you unkillable. Why would I ever? That's awesome. You should do a cringe only stream.

767
04:01:41,670 --> 04:01:52,139
You mean just like desperately try to be as horrible as possible. Headache stream. I and

768
04:01:52,139 --> 04:02:08,899
I are, I just, hold on. I'm trying to get after this. You already do that. Hold on. This is a

769
04:02:08,899 --> 04:02:15,290
torture stream? What? This game's fun. It's just, I mean, just turn, I know you're hearing

770
04:02:15,450 --> 04:02:37,909
la la la la. Put the mission and goal left. I'm about to beat the mission. Remember who's better,

771
04:02:37,909 --> 04:03:00,100
Ace of Base or the 90s Beach Boys? Ace of Base. Ace of Base is the ones that I saw the sign

772
04:03:00,100 --> 04:03:26,700
and it opened up my eyes. I saw the sign. That's, is that Ace of Base? That pot. Get that pot.

773
04:03:26,700 --> 04:03:42,340
I'm out of pots, dude. I got, I'm out of pots. I'm potting. I'm potting. That's the, that's the,

774
04:03:42,420 --> 04:04:01,909
that's the cringe content I'm looking for. That's the real cringe content. Don't say that. There it

775
04:04:01,909 --> 04:04:48,229
is. I'm losing my mind. Hero makes you take no damage. This is great actually. Viewers are

776
04:04:48,229 --> 04:04:57,500
plummeting. I think that already happened back when I was arguing with you guys about the input

777
04:04:57,500 --> 04:05:03,260
delay and thousands of people were just like, ah, fucking out of here. This is, I'm done with this

778
04:05:03,260 --> 04:05:32,379
for one. We're the true fans. We, I feel like I'm fighting the same three people here for

779
04:05:32,379 --> 04:05:45,670
15 straight minutes. We stayed for the input delay stream. Oh, mega lol. I still had fun. I mean,

780
04:05:45,670 --> 04:06:22,100
this game is fun. There's the ice foresters finally. I like the RPG elements. This is not

781
04:06:22,100 --> 04:06:37,219
the final boss. No way. I need more rain. Can I get these guys closer? Get in closer. Closer.

782
04:06:39,799 --> 04:07:08,329
All right. Now, the pen. Game's 25 hours long. Plenty of content. Maybe I'm not strong enough.

783
04:07:08,329 --> 04:07:21,290
Maybe I was supposed to grind. They definitely use this kind of stuff in Guantanamo.

784
04:07:31,459 --> 04:07:59,959
You consider and play this? It's not, you guys are overreacting. Come on. It's like

785
04:07:59,959 --> 04:08:19,690
my alarm clock won't turn off. It's, don't worry. Don't make me laugh right now.

786
04:08:20,329 --> 04:08:53,700
I did it. Kill, kill, kill, kill. Yeah. Hey, do a game mute sound joke. Come on, relax, relax.

787
04:08:54,340 --> 04:09:00,469
I don't want to have to start banning people. Remember, a wave of my finger and you're gone.

788
04:09:01,110 --> 04:09:43,899
I did it. I say the word, you're out of here. Don't ever forget that. Okay. Now follow the guy that

789
04:09:43,899 --> 04:10:00,729
go to the left, right? The streamer gave me a headache and then banned me. Well, I never told

790
04:10:00,809 --> 04:10:05,690
you to turn the volume up all the way and put your eyes, so the wet part of your eyes is touching

791
04:10:05,690 --> 04:10:16,940
your monitor. I didn't tell you to do that. Left one, two, three, one, two, three. Oh, the

792
04:10:16,940 --> 04:10:22,620
mighty Jerry. I'm delighted. I am to meet you. I'm fabulous. I'm the fabulous dance instructor.

793
04:10:22,620 --> 04:10:27,819
Sharaba Yapon, master of the disco, foxtrot, polka, and waltz. The mission is in life. It's

794
04:10:27,819 --> 04:10:32,299
great. The most fabulous dancers. I love people who are practicing right here. I'll be able to

795
04:10:32,299 --> 04:10:36,860
versus training. My name is master of disco. It'll be my honor to teach you a good movie.

796
04:10:37,739 --> 04:10:42,170
Okay. Right here. Behold the amazing things to my build pupils. All right, let's do it.

797
04:10:44,219 --> 04:10:51,819
Yes, I guess. Cafeteria meals. Okay. Meat. Here, take a walnut. I don't take one of these. What

798
04:10:51,819 --> 04:11:04,700
should I give? What do I give? What do I give? A map? Stick? Give a wooden branch?

799
04:11:18,040 --> 04:11:32,899
The as a rich person's doorbell. I may not be too smart, but I'll do the best I can. Please teach

800
04:11:32,899 --> 04:11:47,379
me to dance. Great, Jerry. Have you danced to this song before? No. What button is that?

801
04:11:47,379 --> 04:12:01,420
The important notes scroll across the screen. When a note gets there, press O. As long as we keep on

802
04:12:01,420 --> 04:12:07,420
dancing, the notes will keep on passing. When you see a whole bunch of notes coming through, press

803
04:12:07,420 --> 04:12:17,319
the circle button as many times as you can. Go nuts. The more times you press, the more kaching

804
04:12:17,319 --> 04:12:27,209
that'll pay. Now instructor, I'm ready to begin. If you press O in time for notes, Sharaba Yapon

805
04:12:27,209 --> 04:13:04,729
will wave his batons to help you dance along. Dance. More fun than the actual game. The blob

806
04:13:04,729 --> 04:13:26,379
two waiting room. Understood. Okay. How about level two, level one? Is this level correct?

807
04:13:26,379 --> 04:13:38,729
That was fun. Into the stream voice. He sounds like you. He does not sound like you.

808
04:13:39,370 --> 04:13:51,959
Into the stream. How can you hate this game and then play gotcha force for 15

809
04:13:51,959 --> 04:13:55,879
hours with its one song? I didn't, I never told you I hated this game.

810
04:13:56,520 --> 04:14:01,639
You are implanting that as I'm being asked. I'm being, that's not, I never said that. I didn't say

811
04:14:01,639 --> 04:14:15,379
that. Oh, left again. What's a better Olympic sport term, a trampoline or the ribbon dancing?

812
04:14:15,379 --> 04:14:20,979
The ribbon dancing is the, is the best sport in the Olympics completely. It's just the coolest

813
04:14:20,979 --> 04:14:26,729
thing that, I mean, trampolines is cool, but the ribbon dancing is way cooler. What are the tree?

814
04:14:28,170 --> 04:14:52,649
What do you want? You missed it. Like this, nothing here. I'm gonna call it here. We're

815
04:14:52,649 --> 04:15:03,540
gonna hang out for the bits. We'll chill for like probably like an hour. He hates it. No, he doesn't.

816
04:15:04,100 --> 04:15:15,379
Just trying to adhere to his schedule. What would you give for a grade? Seven out of 10.

817
04:15:21,670 --> 04:15:31,319
He just decided to torture his chat today. I can't, I don't, I don't, I think it's, I think

818
04:15:31,319 --> 04:15:40,729
it's cool. I think it's cute. I think it's fun. I think there's a lot of depth. He will never beat

819
04:15:40,729 --> 04:16:02,700
Groyo Groyo. A strong seven. Um, it's very, very strong. I'm so glad that Jerma hates chat. Why

820
04:16:02,700 --> 04:16:08,549
would you be glad about something that's not even true? No, I, I, I can't wait. I can't give

821
04:16:08,549 --> 04:16:12,889
something a grade that I played for like four hours. It's like a 25 hour game and I played it

822
04:16:12,889 --> 04:16:20,440
for like four or five hours to check it out and see if I liked it. I liked it. I can't be like,

823
04:16:20,440 --> 04:16:32,389
ah, it was an A plus. I don't know. It could be. What would you rate us? Um, that changes between

824
04:16:32,389 --> 04:16:49,110
Monday and Friday. On like Tuesday, maybe sometimes maybe you guys could be a six. On like Thursdays,

825
04:16:49,110 --> 04:16:56,469
you might be a nine. Saturday? Oh, that's where the fives come out. Sunday? That's where the

826
04:16:56,469 --> 04:17:02,549
fives come out. Monday? Fives come out. Tuesday, usually sixes come out. Wednesday, usually the

827
04:17:02,549 --> 04:17:11,510
eights or the nines. Thursday, probably like sixes. Wait, what's today? I didn't give a day. I know.

828
04:17:11,510 --> 04:17:29,899
Oh, I didn't give a grade for Thursday. Ah, Thursday. Oh, you guys are great. I'm fucking

829
04:17:29,899 --> 04:17:38,540
kidding. Relax. You guys are always a fucking, at least 8.5, at least a nine. First of all,

830
04:17:38,540 --> 04:17:45,819
I don't get a 10 because somebody says I have big zits on my forehead. If I turn my face cam on,

831
04:17:45,819 --> 04:17:59,719
that brings you all down. It brings you all down to a fucking nine. If everybody in the room got

832
04:17:59,719 --> 04:18:07,459
an A on their test and two people get an F, um, sorry, but the collective class was like a B plus.

833
04:18:08,260 --> 04:18:24,020
That's just how it works. Oh no, I got an F out of 4,000 students. No, I'm saying if you got like a,

834
04:18:26,360 --> 04:18:33,299
that wouldn't even like move the needle. If you had like 4,000 A's and like two F's,

835
04:18:35,620 --> 04:18:42,040
they wouldn't even affect the grade. You can hear the bogged in his voice.

836
04:18:43,239 --> 04:18:49,510
Nah, I'll see you guys on Monday. We're going to do No More Heroes. We're going to do Monday,

837
04:18:49,510 --> 04:18:57,879
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. And then we're going to do another community content night

838
04:18:58,440 --> 04:19:08,379
because I want to catch it up. We'll do another community content night probably on somewhere.

839
04:19:11,420 --> 04:19:18,819
Let's see. You know, no, you know what? This makes perfect sense. You ready? We're going to do,

840
04:19:21,340 --> 04:19:29,780
it'll end up being Thursday the 14th because that's, that's like perfect timing because then

841
04:19:29,780 --> 04:19:33,379
it's Thursday the 14th will be community content night. Friday would be Easy Bay Govan and then

842
04:19:33,379 --> 04:19:41,989
Saturday will be DLC for free green screen. So in like, like two weeks from now. Exactly.

843
04:19:42,709 --> 04:19:51,430
But I'll see you Monday. We're going to start and complete No More Heroes 2 and then we're going to

844
04:19:51,430 --> 04:19:57,670
start and complete Resident Evil 3. And then if we still have time on Thursday, if I don't beat it

845
04:19:57,670 --> 04:20:09,399
on Thursday or on Wednesday, we will do something else. That sounds like a good plan to me, but

846
04:20:09,399 --> 04:20:14,760
we'll see you soon. Thanks for watching. Thanks for spending your last week. Thanks for spending

847
04:20:14,760 --> 04:20:20,309
your middle of your week with me or the beginning of your week until now. Yeah. Thanks for spending

848
04:20:20,309 --> 04:20:28,229
it with me. We have fun. You're definitely going to beat it in one stream. Even these weak ass

849
04:20:28,229 --> 04:20:48,170
short streams. The game, weak ass short stream. I'm trying to get healthy. God damn it. This was

850
04:20:48,170 --> 04:20:56,950
good to hear you. You better do another 12 hour stream someday. That's never going to happen.

851
04:21:04,219 --> 04:21:19,829
Stop smoking. I don't smoke. He got soft. Whatever it is, he got something. Whatever,

852
04:21:19,829 --> 04:21:26,139
whatever weird bone disease I have, I've, I got it. I don't know. It just happened. Shit happens.

853
04:21:26,780 --> 04:21:42,200
Oh, we'll see on Monday. He's got boneitis, pretzel bones.

854
04:21:43,479 --> 04:21:50,870
It must be from all the donkey donuts. You're going to do no more streaming on weekends.

855
04:21:51,829 --> 04:22:04,090
Um, no, that's just kind of how it, this is, I mean, Friday and Saturday, we have a plan for

856
04:22:04,090 --> 04:22:11,579
Thursday, Friday, Saturday for the, what? It's just how it plays out, you know, four days in a row,

857
04:22:11,579 --> 04:22:16,540
like three days, four days, three days, five days is kind of how it just plays out with the new

858
04:22:16,540 --> 04:22:34,120
schedule. I want to try. Tweet about it so you don't forget it. Do a face cam. You're too

859
04:22:34,120 --> 04:22:40,649
self-conscious. I already did. He's got a germ. I'm sorry. The game sucks. Why is everybody saying

860
04:22:40,649 --> 04:22:46,920
that? It's no, it's because I did the stupid comedy thing where I was like, it's fucking

861
04:22:46,920 --> 04:22:51,799
game. Stupid fucking goddamn fucking game sucks. It's fucking terrible. Like I, I tell I gotta

862
04:22:51,799 --> 04:22:56,549
stop doing that. I have to stop shit posting it on my own stream. I got to stop doing that.

863
04:22:56,549 --> 04:23:14,489
I'm not doing that anymore. No more jokes, but let's, uh, let's do the bits. See you Monday.

864
04:23:15,049 --> 04:23:25,000
Stop denying the fact that you wanted to stab your thumbs through those juicy pat upon eyes

865
04:23:25,000 --> 04:23:36,809
and watch them squirm omega low. That's not, that's not an omega low scenario. That's a, uh,

866
04:23:40,520 --> 04:23:50,010
that's a monk S scenario. That's an actual omega psycho. All right. I'll see you Monday. Let's do

867
04:23:50,010 --> 04:23:54,700
the bits. We have two 50 from pigeon. Jeremy, you cannot title your stream. The marching band.

868
04:23:54,700 --> 04:23:57,659
I thought I meant you finally hired the high school marching band. You said you would on the

869
04:23:57,659 --> 04:24:06,870
official podcast. And I got so hyped just for this. Just kidding. That's it. I, uh, that's,

870
04:24:06,870 --> 04:24:13,270
I promise you one day that'll happen before I stop streaming forever. Whenever that date is,

871
04:24:15,510 --> 04:24:22,870
there will be a full 20 plus person in full costume marching band on this stream. I promise

872
04:24:22,870 --> 04:24:27,750
without even no, no good audio either. Do like just the regular mic. I promise. I fucking promise

873
04:24:27,750 --> 04:24:35,450
it's going to happen. It has to AC 4G. Thanks for the two 50. What's the status on the resident evil

874
04:24:35,450 --> 04:24:42,649
three stream. But I, there you go. I hope you're here. Talked about it. Well, it's going to be

875
04:24:42,649 --> 04:24:56,180
happening next week on Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday. Should be fun. Hey, Lando

876
04:24:56,180 --> 04:25:00,260
Bando. Thanks for the two 50. Hey there, big J. You've inspired so many of my creative endeavors.

877
04:25:00,260 --> 04:25:05,139
So now I'm working on a German mockumentary where I tour around Boston to important places

878
04:25:05,139 --> 04:25:14,969
such as the donkey doughnuts, where you were born as you chase me. Also, you should play

879
04:25:14,969 --> 04:25:20,010
blood bowl too. It's kind of like the league, but all this kind of like blitz, the league,

880
04:25:20,010 --> 04:25:25,319
but all the stupidity has been brought up to 11 helicopters, crash, fantasy races,

881
04:25:25,319 --> 04:25:36,629
and straight up killing the other team. Is that really what I'm going to look into that. It seems

882
04:25:36,629 --> 04:25:46,040
fun. Thanks for the two 50. And here comes a mockumentary sticks renegade. Thanks for two 50.

883
04:25:46,040 --> 04:25:51,000
Hey there. Hey Jerry. Remember if you cannot play Jackie Chan stunt master within 10 years,

884
04:25:51,000 --> 04:25:54,600
you automatically admit that Willy Wonka 2005 is better Wonka movie.

885
04:25:54,600 --> 04:26:05,100
Jerma Grin. That's fine. Not going to happen. X in X. Thanks for the two 50. When's toon town?

886
04:26:05,100 --> 04:26:18,020
It'll probably happen at the end of May. I would guess a drum major. Thanks for the two 50. Happy

887
04:26:18,020 --> 04:26:24,120
May day, Jerma. Today all over Europe, we celebrate spring and the workers day here in Finland. It's

888
04:26:24,120 --> 04:26:28,680
one of the four major holidays there are. The tradition of those graduated from

889
04:26:28,680 --> 04:26:34,200
Lucio, probably closest to senior high school in the US school system. They go out to parks and get

890
04:26:34,200 --> 04:26:39,239
wasted while wearing their graduation capes, which sadly isn't possible this year due to Corona.

891
04:26:39,239 --> 04:26:44,329
Do you celebrate it all in the States? Here's a few picks to give you an idea.

892
04:26:44,329 --> 04:26:57,819
Um, not, I mean, people have like grad, people had graduation parties where yeah, it would be like,

893
04:26:57,819 --> 04:27:03,659
oh, like we graduated, let's hang out. But also you have to remember, um, he's talking about

894
04:27:03,659 --> 04:27:11,049
going out and like having drinks. Uh, the drinking age in the United States is 21. So you can't,

895
04:27:11,049 --> 04:27:16,409
we, you can't like go out and get drinks and have, get drinks when you're 17, 18, 19,

896
04:27:16,409 --> 04:27:24,809
drinking age is 21. So it was more of a grill food outside and have people have your friends

897
04:27:24,809 --> 04:27:40,899
and family come over and give you cards with like $20 bills and more so how that happened.

898
04:27:40,899 --> 04:27:48,840
So not necessarily the same thing. What is, um, I'm just, just out of curiosity.

899
04:27:48,840 --> 04:27:54,440
What is the drinking age in Finland? What's like the, the, the legal drinking age in Finland,

900
04:27:54,440 --> 04:28:07,129
the 18, 16, 18, probably 18. A lot of the European countries are somewhere, what 18 and some of them

901
04:28:07,129 --> 04:28:20,790
even lower than that, right? 18, 20 for alcohol over 21%. Huh. You're in Denmark. It's 15.

902
04:28:20,790 --> 04:28:33,239
Germany is 16, 16 in Germany. Yeah. So it's weird. It's as an American,

903
04:28:33,879 --> 04:28:42,120
it's so weird to think about that at like 16, you could like legally drink alcohol. That's like such

904
04:28:42,120 --> 04:28:54,940
a foreign concept to me. Wow. What? No, you can't, you can't do that. You're not 21. Are you? How do

905
04:28:54,940 --> 04:29:05,620
you? It's interesting. People drink anyway. Don't be ridiculous. Oh, I'm talking about

906
04:29:06,579 --> 04:29:20,950
in a legal sense. Like you, you can't go into the, into the grocery store guys at 16 and buy

907
04:29:20,950 --> 04:29:42,360
like beer. You can in Germany. Like that's, it's just so different. You can't go and do it. Period.

908
04:29:43,000 --> 04:29:56,940
Oh, it depends on where you are. Yeah. But, um, we don't know. That's, that's not something that we

909
04:29:56,940 --> 04:30:03,479
really do. At least I didn't do it just because it was, it was more like a family get together

910
04:30:03,479 --> 04:30:13,000
and it was like, have like a big party with your friends crazy that we can draft someone,

911
04:30:13,000 --> 04:30:23,370
but not let them drink. Yeah. Where did the, well, okay. I know it's like the age of being

912
04:30:23,370 --> 04:30:28,889
knighted, right? Isn't 21. Is that even real? Or is that just like a fake article I read one day?

913
04:30:29,530 --> 04:30:34,059
Wasn't it like, Oh, the nights got night at a 21 or something.

914
04:30:34,940 --> 04:30:50,739
Mike, because that's fake. That's a, why is it 21? That's an anime plot. Anime laws.

915
04:31:02,360 --> 04:31:12,280
But like you, you're considered an illegal adult. You're an adult at 18 and you're an adult. You can

916
04:31:12,920 --> 04:31:15,959
but know that now like cigarettes are now moving to 21 all over the place too.

917
04:31:19,500 --> 04:31:32,940
A lot of like to buy cigarettes, 21, which it was, it's been, it was 18 for decades and decades.

918
04:31:41,850 --> 04:31:45,850
No, no, I meant you celebrate May day, not graduation day from high school.

919
04:31:48,219 --> 04:31:56,010
No, that's not really a thing here. Most of the, I mean, most of the holidays that are in the

920
04:31:56,010 --> 04:32:03,100
summer, like this late spring and in the summer, and you're talking about, I mean, this it's May

921
04:32:03,100 --> 04:32:12,459
day, May day, but like Memorial day, right? Memorial day with the July, there's a bunch of

922
04:32:12,459 --> 04:32:31,690
things that we do. July 4th. Yeah. But not in particular May day. No, I wanted to say Zyxia

923
04:32:31,690 --> 04:32:37,370
again gave a hundred community subs, which is fucking crazy. It's just so many subs to give it

924
04:32:37,370 --> 04:32:45,219
in one second. I really hope you can afford it. That's a lot of money to give somebody ever.

925
04:32:46,729 --> 04:32:55,270
Thank you, Zyxia. Do a drunk stream, please. I just did. I just did like four or five days ago.

926
04:33:05,080 --> 04:33:10,840
Hey, nope. Thanks for the 500 bits. Yo jumbo. I just wanted to say thanks for streaming. Gotcha

927
04:33:10,840 --> 04:33:15,959
farts the last few days. It helped me fall asleep and fix my sleeping schedule. Smiley face, no space.

928
04:33:16,599 --> 04:33:24,470
Thank you. Hey fishies. Thanks for $5. I've been a long time watcher since 2012 and I've been subbed

929
04:33:24,470 --> 04:33:28,869
ever since I found your Twitch channel, but this is my first time donating. Well, fishies,

930
04:33:29,750 --> 04:33:34,950
thanks for the $5. Thanks for donating. I feel like you deserve more than just a sub. I want

931
04:33:34,950 --> 04:33:38,790
to make sure how you know how much all of us in the community appreciate what you do for us.

932
04:33:38,790 --> 04:33:42,229
No matter what game you play or how long you're online, your streams always make me smile. I just

933
04:33:42,229 --> 04:33:57,669
want to say thank you for being you and never change. I appreciate that, but a sub is you're

934
04:33:57,669 --> 04:34:03,189
kind of paying for it already. You know what I mean? Like if you are subbed to the channel,

935
04:34:04,819 --> 04:34:10,979
you know, you talk about that, you get, that's like $5 a month. You're already contributing.

936
04:34:11,060 --> 04:34:16,299
Like that's, that's already more than I could ever ask anybody to do. So if you've subbed to

937
04:34:16,299 --> 04:34:21,080
the channel, you don't, you don't feel, don't feel like you have to, oh no, I want to get,

938
04:34:21,080 --> 04:34:30,229
I have to give more. You don't have to. If you, you don't have to give anything.

939
04:34:34,150 --> 04:34:37,270
Being subbed to the channel and thinking I have to give more money,

940
04:34:39,049 --> 04:34:56,500
something I really hope people don't really think they have to do. You're worth donating to. If you

941
04:34:56,500 --> 04:35:09,060
think that, then that's, that's for you to decide. But I've, I've, I've toyed with the idea.

942
04:35:11,509 --> 04:35:18,060
And I mean, this, this is, this is just all hypotheticals and all, um, just thought project

943
04:35:18,060 --> 04:35:23,959
in quotes. Those of you that remember from a while ago, it, I, I never had a donation link.

944
04:35:23,959 --> 04:35:28,200
I never had one. It was always something that I was like, I don't really want to do that

945
04:35:28,840 --> 04:35:33,849
because people sub your sub, you already paid for it, whatever. And then when bits came along,

946
04:35:33,849 --> 04:35:41,639
it was like, oh, I guess it took me a while to kind of be okay with it and like, want to do it.

947
04:35:41,639 --> 04:35:50,250
And I think about stuff sometimes if, what if there was no bits? What if you could just sub

948
04:35:50,250 --> 04:36:12,970
to this channel? Sometimes I think about that. Community subs would be insane and you'd have to

949
04:36:12,970 --> 04:36:28,759
bring back sub sounds. Imagine there's no bits. It isn't hard to do. Oh, I see what you're doing.

950
04:36:34,779 --> 04:36:37,979
I think about this kind of stuff all the time where it's like, well, what, what if you just like,

951
04:36:37,979 --> 04:36:43,419
okay, you've, it's fine. You pay, you, you just optionally pay $5 a month if you feel like it.

952
04:36:45,590 --> 04:36:49,430
Like it's not, oh, I, I, I want to give you more money. I want to give you like

953
04:36:49,430 --> 04:36:55,590
5,000 more dollars. Like essentially like an optional Netflix subscription,

954
04:36:56,310 --> 04:37:14,139
Patreon, but, and then, well, what happens to stuff like this?

955
04:37:20,919 --> 04:37:26,169
Is it, it's worth it if you're going to keep streaming? Yeah, I've, I've no, nothing would

956
04:37:26,169 --> 04:37:38,220
change. It would just be like monetarily speaking, subscriptions would be like the only

957
04:37:38,220 --> 04:37:45,880
form of this channel bringing in like money. And this is not something I'm saying I'm going to do,

958
04:37:46,759 --> 04:37:57,110
but I don't know. It's something to think about. I don't do Patreon.

959
04:37:57,110 --> 04:38:05,830
Thought project for the day. He's thinking of ways to make less money.

960
04:38:07,020 --> 04:38:25,340
I mean, that's no less money equals less carnivals. That, but that's not even necessarily true.

961
04:38:30,459 --> 04:38:41,909
Set chat to true fans only mode, less clowns. No, no, no. Five million. He already has too much

962
04:38:41,909 --> 04:38:55,380
money, but to move on from that, I just something to think about not happening. No worry. I'm going

963
04:38:55,380 --> 04:39:03,099
to keep those bits on released a little while longer. Just a few more. That's it. Just a couple

964
04:39:03,099 --> 04:39:20,330
more of those bits. Let us pay you. I look, but you do. You, you do. Like you don't pay Netflix

965
04:39:20,330 --> 04:39:38,630
extra money a month. I'm sure they'd take it. Who cares about them? Yeah. Netflix each shit.

966
04:39:45,689 --> 04:39:48,490
You are at Netflix. You're yeah. But that's what I mean. Like optional.

967
04:39:49,209 --> 04:40:08,650
Like it is now Netflix doesn't have easy bake oven. Yeah. It's just a thought. I'm just,

968
04:40:08,650 --> 04:40:13,849
I'm just giving hypotheticals and kind of seeing what you guys think about it. We can move on.

969
04:40:13,849 --> 04:40:16,889
It's not happening. This is not like, by the way, next week, there's bits of deleted.

970
04:40:17,450 --> 04:40:26,229
Just want to see what you guys had to say about, Hey, Nope. Thanks for the $5. Yo jumbo. Just want

971
04:40:26,229 --> 04:40:37,750
to say thanks for streaming. Gotcha. Far. It's already read this one. Hey, hey, sick. Ik sick.

972
04:40:37,750 --> 04:40:48,020
Ikka sick. Ikka sick six. It's pronounced six. Ikka. All right. I got it right. Thank you. Six

973
04:40:48,020 --> 04:40:58,619
Ikka for the six Ikka. Yeah, I got it. Thank you. Six Ikka for the thousand it's and your

974
04:40:58,619 --> 04:41:12,099
hundred community subs. I say Zyxia. It's hard for me to forget and hard for me to learn new words.

975
04:41:18,169 --> 04:41:21,770
Thanks for the huge amount of money. Hopefully I got your name right.

976
04:41:22,650 --> 04:41:28,759
The chef's corner. Thanks for the thousand bits. Jeremiah Elberton is not real. Please

977
04:41:28,759 --> 04:41:37,779
refrain from attacking thus weak point from massive damage. Jerma hates Fortnite. I don't

978
04:41:37,779 --> 04:41:45,740
hate Fortnite. I just hate playing Fortnite. There's a difference there. Stains. Thanks for

979
04:41:45,740 --> 04:41:52,599
the 250. Your hair is great. No matter what they say. King. Thank you. Hey, Locky man. Thanks for

980
04:41:52,599 --> 04:42:04,009
$5. I always enjoy watching you play rhythm games. Keep up the good work. Hey, the funky man. Thanks

981
04:42:04,009 --> 04:42:08,520
for the 300 bits. Hey, my mom got me these bits because she wanted me to tell you she thinks you

982
04:42:08,520 --> 04:42:14,599
are hot. I'm not kidding. She actually did. So here's her Instagram. Please message her or

983
04:42:14,599 --> 04:42:34,330
she'll keep bothering me about it. I appreciate the compliment. I'm currently in a relationship

984
04:42:35,049 --> 04:42:45,560
and I am everything is going great and everything's cool. I don't I'm sorry, but I am me.

985
04:42:47,159 --> 04:42:52,599
I have words coming out of my mouth. I really appreciate the comment. I appreciate. I'm happy

986
04:42:52,599 --> 04:43:08,259
to hear it. Okay, I don't even want to let's go. Hey, thanks for the $5. Jeremy, do you call Otto

987
04:43:08,259 --> 04:43:28,069
your furry boy that make you and Kim his skin parents? No, actually his name we call Otto. We

988
04:43:28,069 --> 04:43:37,639
call them Mr. Horace Zonto for a couple of particular reasons. Because he went in bed.

989
04:43:39,909 --> 04:43:45,590
He always sleeps. He never sleeps vertical. He always sleeps horizontally. And he's kind of just

990
04:43:45,590 --> 04:43:49,830
gets in the way. Oh, he's in the way. Oh, he's horizontal. Oh, come on. What are you doing,

991
04:43:49,830 --> 04:44:01,930
Mr. Horace Zonto? Horace Zonto. That's weird. When I'm even vertical, like he sleeps like

992
04:44:01,930 --> 04:44:06,169
a horizontally on the bed, not like vertical like a human. So he's kind of gets in the way.

993
04:44:06,810 --> 04:44:16,680
We call him Horace Zonto. You're gonna minus two, like a little fun name I give my dog.

994
04:44:19,380 --> 04:44:25,939
I didn't preface that by going, Okay, I got some funny to tell you. My dog, right? He's a dog.

995
04:44:27,380 --> 04:44:35,159
That's not even a joke. That's not that I shouldn't even told you. It's like a me and Kim thing.

996
04:44:35,159 --> 04:44:38,840
Can't believe I just like told you guys that I just like let you I just like got the looking glass

997
04:44:38,840 --> 04:44:45,299
and got to see into my private life. And it just throws back in my face. See if I share anything

998
04:44:45,299 --> 04:45:02,490
else with you guys again. I can't wait to a blue screen of death to a symbiotic entity. Thanks for

999
04:45:02,490 --> 04:45:11,669
the five community subs local IRS agent. Thanks for the $5 local IRS agent. Thanks for five more

1000
04:45:11,669 --> 04:45:16,470
dollars. Hey, Jeremy, you haven't returned our calls about our findings. It's come to our attention

1001
04:45:16,470 --> 04:45:21,270
from a very reliable source that you were in fact, a million dollar streamer will be taking

1002
04:45:21,270 --> 04:45:35,430
our cut of the dough next tax season. Hey, thanks for the $10. Do I get to deduct that?

1003
04:45:36,950 --> 04:45:50,500
I can can I deduct this? Or what would this count as? Now I owe 10 more dollars. 1 million and 10.

1004
04:45:52,569 --> 04:46:06,169
Fucking millionaire streamer thing. Check his account he has in the Bahamas. Talking about how

1005
04:46:06,169 --> 04:46:19,990
bad I'm getting bogged. And we think we think I got a million dollars. Hey, goiki. Thanks for the

1006
04:46:19,990 --> 04:46:59,450
500 bits. Beyond bogs. Beyond boggers. Beyond meat, man. But thank you, goiki. Thanks for the $5,

1007
04:46:59,450 --> 04:47:06,580
goiki. My sister borrowed my PayPal and asked me why I spent nearly $150 on Twitch this week.

1008
04:47:07,220 --> 04:47:13,959
And I hadn't the heart to tell her they were important expenses to appease an e-clown. In

1009
04:47:13,959 --> 04:47:17,799
all seriousness though, I don't know what else I'd spend it on rather than someone who brings me so

1010
04:47:17,799 --> 04:47:37,000
much happiness. So here's five more dollars to the bank. Please. The bank will be pleased.

1011
04:47:38,419 --> 04:47:44,819
Maybe maybe your girlfriend. Wait, you didn't you know, why are you guys saying girlfriend?

1012
04:47:44,819 --> 04:48:06,819
It's a sister. Take your sister out to a nice steak dinner. Thanks for the $5 though.

1013
04:48:07,540 --> 04:48:16,360
Hey, S Halukko. Thanks for the 250. What is the best pasta shape and why is it Casa Ricis?

1014
04:48:17,159 --> 04:48:23,720
Also, thanks for all the laughs. The best pasta is angel hair pasta. Angel hair like spaghetti.

1015
04:48:24,279 --> 04:48:39,450
Either that or big sloppy fettuccine noodles. Just absolutely just soaking, slathered in sauce.

1016
04:48:40,250 --> 04:48:46,090
Just slathered in fettuccine Alfredo sauce with crispy sliced up chicken. All right, I'm hungry.

1017
04:48:46,090 --> 04:49:08,090
Bye. See you guys on Monday. Olive oil. Good olive oil. Good one. Yeah, yeah, that's gonna be

1018
04:49:08,729 --> 04:49:15,540
good. Welcome to barbecue pit boys.com. Today we're going to be making some barbecue

1019
04:49:15,540 --> 04:49:25,880
stuffed hamburgers on the grill. Man gonna be good. Oh, you're getting hungry or what?

1020
04:49:26,439 --> 04:49:43,380
I watch every single one of their videos. For real though, thanks for the 250. Enough of these

1021
04:49:43,380 --> 04:49:52,279
baby games. Play mercenaries playground of destruction. Holy shit. I bought that game

1022
04:49:53,900 --> 04:49:59,299
like eight months ago and I was going to play it eight months ago and just be like, hey, that's

1023
04:49:59,299 --> 04:50:06,040
what we're doing today and I just forgot. All right, I gotta get that done. I can do that soon.

1024
04:50:06,759 --> 04:50:12,520
The game looks insane. Yeah, we'll do that very soon. Don't let me forget about that because I

1025
04:50:12,520 --> 04:50:19,080
will after about 10 minutes after the stream ends. Mercenaries too. Yeah, that's the one. Hey,

1026
04:50:19,080 --> 04:50:27,110
Wembley TTV. Thanks for the 250. Do you know what day it is today? It's Thursday. Thursday for me.

1027
04:50:29,419 --> 04:50:33,099
Gurus say thanks for the 300 bits. Hey bro, I just finished high school tonight. Graduating

1028
04:50:33,099 --> 04:50:38,860
early because of online school. Thanks again for all you do. Congratulations. Close that book and

1029
04:50:38,860 --> 04:50:45,189
open a new one. Open a new one. Close that book and open a new one. Remember when you're on that

1030
04:50:45,189 --> 04:50:52,979
highway. Forward. There ain't no brakes on the highway. No slowing down. No going back. You

1031
04:50:52,979 --> 04:51:07,349
don't turn around on the highway. Forward. Miss the exit. Gosh, it's okay. Get off of the next one.

1032
04:51:07,349 --> 04:51:18,439
Nah, seriously though, congrats. Thanks for the motivation, Jeremy. You're welcome. Do you guys

1033
04:51:18,439 --> 04:51:24,409
think I could make a career out of being that voice on the radio that comes on and sounds like

1034
04:51:24,409 --> 04:51:39,529
this? I guess I could. Are you serious? You want to talk about like a millionaire? Just absolutely

1035
04:51:39,529 --> 04:51:51,529
throw myself out there and just do 500 of those a day. If I do like 500 of these voice radio

1036
04:51:51,529 --> 04:51:56,459
commercials, that's a million dollars right there. That's easy. Each one is worth how much? Okay,

1037
04:51:56,459 --> 04:52:05,340
let's do some math. Let's say each one's worth what? Like 300 bucks? 400 bucks? 300 bucks?

1038
04:52:05,340 --> 04:52:13,610
Let's just say 300 bucks times a thousand. That's 300,000 dollars and then take that to the casino

1039
04:52:13,610 --> 04:52:41,380
and put it all on on black. That's 600,000. Write a children's book. If you make a million dollars,

1040
04:52:41,380 --> 04:52:59,099
you would only gain one fifth of your net worth, Jeremy. What do you mean a fifth? I would only

1041
04:52:59,099 --> 04:53:16,840
gain one fifth. What are you talking about? Because of like taxes? They're claiming you're

1042
04:53:16,840 --> 04:53:36,580
worth five million already. No, guys, I'm like an idle game. If I ever got close to a million dollars,

1043
04:53:36,580 --> 04:53:44,180
it would just be removed because I would do like a fucking ultra carnival. Every time I get close,

1044
04:53:44,900 --> 04:53:48,419
it would just be constant idle game. Like I would never, it would never cross a million. It would

1045
04:53:48,419 --> 04:54:09,880
never happen. It admits he's been close. No, not even close. Not even remotely close. Not,

1046
04:54:09,880 --> 04:54:17,209
not even halfway there. Not even, not even a quarter of the way there. Not even, not even

1047
04:54:19,029 --> 04:54:37,529
like a tenth of the way there. You guys got to remove some zeros. He's a hundred K

1048
04:54:38,409 --> 04:54:55,000
heir. 90K after the whole beyond meat thing.

1049
04:55:06,950 --> 04:55:13,080
Are you still in debt from the live rumble? Did I ever talk? You know what? It's been long enough.

1050
04:55:13,880 --> 04:55:20,979
Have I ever talked about where I got the money for the live rumble? Do we talk about this yet?

1051
04:55:24,360 --> 04:55:44,169
No, we haven't. We have not. Have we not talked about it? Um, I, uh, I drew from my retirement

1052
04:55:44,250 --> 04:56:17,180
account and liquidated it. It's true, but it's okay. I take it back. He's broke.

1053
04:56:17,900 --> 04:56:25,700
Did you invest in a new one? I did. I don't know. Everything's fine. Don't worry. I was like,

1054
04:56:25,700 --> 04:56:33,750
all right, how do I, uh, uh, I'm doing this. How much does it cost to do this? Oh,

1055
04:56:36,819 --> 04:56:45,689
$10,000 to make this video. Oh, let's go. Well, how much more do I need?

1056
04:56:49,189 --> 04:57:12,150
And he liquidated the new one for the carnival. No, somebody said something.

1057
04:57:15,349 --> 04:57:19,590
This doesn't count as a retirement. Uh, I don't want to even, I don't even want to even go there,

1058
04:57:19,590 --> 04:57:35,700
but what you said is fucking funny. Uh, no, how much was the carnival? Um, I, it hasn't been long

1059
04:57:35,700 --> 04:57:40,860
enough. It hasn't been long enough. It hasn't been long enough. It has to be like three years

1060
04:57:41,580 --> 04:58:33,220
for me to say it. It's been three years. It's been three dog years. It was $40,000. He's broke.

1061
04:58:34,419 --> 04:58:47,240
Who are those estimates at again for how much money I have? Uh, no, I'll be real with you.

1062
04:58:47,240 --> 04:58:56,299
Let's be real. Ready? Let's get real for a second. Um, if I want to do something and I think it will

1063
04:58:56,299 --> 04:59:04,950
be fun, I'm going to do it. I'm just going to fucking do it. And if I have like the capital

1064
04:59:05,909 --> 04:59:17,909
to do it, I'm going to do it. Did you get any profit from the carnival? Um, well, that depends

1065
04:59:17,909 --> 04:59:26,520
on how you look at that, right? Because no, no jokes, no fucking around. Like let's get serious.

1066
04:59:27,159 --> 04:59:33,369
There's been a huge amount of attention on this channel since then, but just there has been,

1067
04:59:33,369 --> 04:59:39,610
and a lot of new people have showed up. A lot of people are here and the channel has grown a lot

1068
04:59:39,610 --> 04:59:52,659
since then. So I don't know over the, over the year of, of, I'm not looking for a return though.

1069
04:59:52,659 --> 04:59:57,540
Like that's a, I'm not, I don't look at it that way. It's like, did it, was that fun? Did people

1070
04:59:57,540 --> 05:00:01,779
like it? And did a bunch of people have a good time and was it worth doing? I think, I think it was

1071
05:00:10,950 --> 05:00:19,799
and mean some things, things cost money and I'm going to pay for them if I can. And that doesn't

1072
05:00:19,799 --> 05:00:27,349
mean I've used every cent I own, right? Like I would, I would never put myself in any real,

1073
05:00:28,069 --> 05:00:34,009
like financial danger. I hope you guys understand that. There was an opportunity,

1074
05:00:36,439 --> 05:00:43,450
then I took it. Do I have a safe savings? I do. I don't worry. I have a retirement account and it's

1075
05:00:43,450 --> 05:00:53,500
doing fine. I have, don't worry. But I've been holding on to that one for a while. And I,

1076
05:00:53,819 --> 05:01:01,380
but that's the point though. Well, who cares? Like I don't, hey, it was, that's how much money it was.

1077
05:01:01,380 --> 05:01:23,450
What do you guys think about that? I don't, who cares? Like I don't want to make it about,

1078
05:01:23,450 --> 05:01:31,479
this is how much it costs guys. So, you know, that was money that I had to spend and excuse me,

1079
05:01:31,479 --> 05:01:36,729
what's going on? Hello. That's why I don't want to talk. I don't like to talk about like what,

1080
05:01:36,810 --> 05:01:47,099
what things cost because I don't want, I don't want to put a burden back to you guys because

1081
05:01:47,099 --> 05:01:51,659
then it's like, Holy shit. Well, that was a lot of money. Should we give him more? No,

1082
05:01:52,380 --> 05:02:07,590
no. The answer is no. Like a full stop. No, absolute no. But if I can put money back into

1083
05:02:07,590 --> 05:02:16,299
the stream because the stream makes money, anybody with a calculator and a computer,

1084
05:02:17,509 --> 05:02:22,630
can, you could take some wild guesses as to how much money this, the stream takes in a month. You

1085
05:02:22,630 --> 05:02:28,229
could. So if I'm capable, I want to put money back into the stream and do fun shit. Why the hell

1086
05:02:28,229 --> 05:02:56,659
wouldn't I? There's no reason in my, for me. It's just, Oh, okay. This I have some, like I've

1087
05:02:56,659 --> 05:03:05,000
revenue from this channel. Do I do a carnival or do I not do a carnival? The answer will always be,

1088
05:03:05,720 --> 05:03:13,860
I will do a carnival, you know, always. So that's just the way it is. And that's the, that's,

1089
05:03:14,419 --> 05:03:26,680
there you go. I talk, I'm, I'm naked in front of you. Hey, Yoda985, thanks to 281,

1090
05:03:27,319 --> 05:03:41,990
you're a persona five villain. And that's also where we get into, not to go any further on this,

1091
05:03:41,990 --> 05:03:49,799
but that's also where it comes down to maybe involve some company or a sponsorship that

1092
05:03:49,799 --> 05:03:54,520
thinks some of that, those ideas are funny and like, lets me kind of do what I want to do

1093
05:03:55,880 --> 05:04:02,919
and like helps out financially. Like maybe I can not have to do that much more money. You know what

1094
05:04:02,919 --> 05:04:10,729
I mean? Maybe like, all right, meet me halfway or something like that to do streams like those.

1095
05:04:12,599 --> 05:04:22,740
That's, we brought up this up a month ago or so, and I don't know, is that possible? Maybe.

1096
05:04:27,779 --> 05:04:35,110
But if I can make a better stream, then I'm going to take the avenue that allows me to do that.

1097
05:04:35,750 --> 05:04:47,860
Or if I try to make a better stream, like try to, because that's all I can do is just try.

1098
05:04:47,860 --> 05:04:55,930
And like, that's it. Was it good? Was it bad? Maybe it wasn't so good, but maybe some of the

1099
05:04:55,930 --> 05:05:01,159
projects you've seen, you're like, that guy, that wasn't that great. Did I learn something from it?

1100
05:05:01,159 --> 05:05:09,639
Can I try again the next time? Maybe, but I don't want to get long winded more than I already am

1101
05:05:09,639 --> 05:05:23,479
about this. Off bugleberry pottery cough. No, no, that was worth it. That's like one of my favorite

1102
05:05:23,479 --> 05:05:38,119
things. I like, I love that segment. It's like, I can't wait to see him back on camera. We're

1103
05:05:38,119 --> 05:05:45,380
going to move on. Do not take anything I said for any reason. I think you need to be concerned

1104
05:05:45,380 --> 05:05:51,619
about my financial life. Yes. Yes. I, I, I pulled from a retirement account to make the German rumble

1105
05:05:51,619 --> 05:05:55,939
video and I would do it a thousand more times because that was some of the most fun I've ever

1106
05:05:55,939 --> 05:06:00,580
had in my entire life. And I will never have that experience again. That's an experience that I will

1107
05:06:00,580 --> 05:06:05,060
never have again. And it was an experience I will never forget. It was absolutely worth doing,

1108
05:06:05,860 --> 05:06:19,750
but that was also, uh, like almost five years ago now. So don't worry, don't worry. I'm doing fine

1109
05:06:20,310 --> 05:06:33,130
until live action rumble two, which will be live and streamed on Twitch. That's the plan.

1110
05:06:34,139 --> 05:06:40,740
I want to do one on Twitch and I want to do one live on Twitch. I have, I've told the whole,

1111
05:06:40,740 --> 05:06:45,299
the whole thing's already written. The whole thing's done. This needs to be set up and

1112
05:06:45,299 --> 05:06:53,139
videotaped. Who has any idea of when that's going to happen? I have no idea. Probably not for a long

1113
05:06:53,139 --> 05:07:10,340
time. Here goes another 40k. No, no, but I don't want to, I just, all right. I, I, that's why I

1114
05:07:10,340 --> 05:07:18,090
don't like talking about like money and shit. I don't want it to be like, eh, whatever. Let's keep

1115
05:07:18,090 --> 05:07:29,529
going. We're almost done. Uh, we have the man with the baby hands. Thanks for 500 bits. Chat has been

1116
05:07:29,529 --> 05:07:37,479
more psychotic than usual tonight. I mean, early in the stream, people were fucking going nuts.

1117
05:07:38,119 --> 05:07:43,849
We're very mean today to me. They were very mean to me. They said he's stupid. He can't even do

1118
05:07:43,849 --> 05:07:53,930
just no rhythm. He's dumb. Then I like turned the webcam on and one of my teeth fell out.

1119
05:07:54,569 --> 05:08:00,729
I was like, what the fuck you guys fucking did? I don't know what, is that, is that possible? Can

1120
05:08:00,729 --> 05:08:12,340
you guys like radio frequency? One of my teeth fall off? It's weird. And then I played the same

1121
05:08:12,340 --> 05:08:18,979
song in their ears, uh, a hundred times. And then people, uh, were like, I'm going to bed,

1122
05:08:18,979 --> 05:08:27,240
which is completely understandable. Thanks to the 500 bits. Hey M. Weldo, thanks for the 250. They

1123
05:08:27,240 --> 05:08:54,970
say it can be done. Uh, what can be done? Oh, what is this? F it up by Lewis Cole and be done.

1124
05:08:59,560 --> 05:09:19,669
Yeah, you can fit them. You can fit people here. But, but here's the only difference is they're not

1125
05:09:19,669 --> 05:09:25,590
in full marching band costume and they don't have, and they're not all playing trumpets and

1126
05:09:25,590 --> 05:09:36,250
tubas. I remember I want a tuba. It can be done though. Yeah. I want to link. Here's a link.

1127
05:09:36,810 --> 05:09:57,509
This is ridiculous though. Anywho, Hey Dell kit. Thanks for the 300 bits.

1128
05:09:57,509 --> 05:10:01,270
Jeremy, first time ever donating. Do you plan on playing Morrowind or even perhaps Daggerfall?

1129
05:10:03,139 --> 05:10:13,240
Um, probably at some point, I feel like you kind of have to. Star and I were talking recently about,

1130
05:10:13,240 --> 05:10:20,569
um, getting SWAT four together, something that we've been trying to do for a long time.

1131
05:10:20,569 --> 05:10:28,840
And it's, it came onto GOG and seemed like a fun idea. And, uh, I was also talking to,

1132
05:10:28,840 --> 05:10:35,909
talking to Italics about it. Maybe get a few people at three, four people maybe and do some SWAT

1133
05:10:40,540 --> 05:10:45,259
recently for the past six years. Well, no, no, recently it came, it came out on GOG like last

1134
05:10:45,259 --> 05:10:50,790
year. Six years ago, we were like, let's play SWAT four, but it's like, oh, you can't, it's kind

1135
05:10:50,790 --> 05:11:01,909
of weird. You can only do it through LAN or you had to buy a server or something. But now on GOG,

1136
05:11:01,909 --> 05:11:11,779
I think you can do a direct connection to each other. I think it was years ago. Well, we'll see.

1137
05:11:11,779 --> 05:11:17,799
But it turned, that was something we were talking about. Cause I know people said Morrowind

1138
05:11:17,799 --> 05:11:25,029
multiplayer do it. That's another thing that'd be fun to do for somebody. I think a lot of people

1139
05:11:25,029 --> 05:11:32,759
say when Joel was playing it or something. And I don't know, it'd be fun. That it should be fun to

1140
05:11:32,759 --> 05:11:40,500
do. Peaceful Haley. Thanks for 250. So I moved in with my grandparents and what do you, what do

1141
05:11:40,500 --> 05:11:45,860
you know? The internet is shit. Download speed is not even one megabit per second and upload is

1142
05:11:45,860 --> 05:12:02,090
like two megabits. Rip my stream. Damn. That's like, it's like next level low. That's like in

1143
05:12:02,090 --> 05:12:15,020
the earth low. That's like, that's in the earth's mantle low. That's insane. Well, hopefully

1144
05:12:16,439 --> 05:12:24,599
we need to get it upgraded or, uh, get to a new spot. Maybe whatever you do. And you can,

1145
05:12:24,680 --> 05:12:28,119
you could maybe, you could squeeze though. You could squeeze some work out of two

1146
05:12:29,000 --> 05:12:34,700
megabits up. It's going to be a little crusty, but it, you, you might be able to make it work.

1147
05:12:34,700 --> 05:12:46,409
It's possible. Ray Joel. Yeah, sure. And I don't know, tell them like, tell them like I shit my

1148
05:12:46,409 --> 05:13:00,919
pants on streaming. It was like insane. Like, dude, it had really, it was fucking crazy.

1149
05:13:02,040 --> 05:13:06,279
Like freaked out and like ran out of the room and like the stream was just on BRB for like fucking

1150
05:13:06,279 --> 05:13:11,560
30 minutes. They came back and he was wicked embarrassed and his face was bright, fucking

1151
05:13:11,560 --> 05:13:28,090
ready at face came on at the time. What the fuck? He left the game on. You're a pathological liar.

1152
05:13:31,259 --> 05:13:39,450
I'm a pathological comedy liar. Come on. No, excuse me. Uh, the proper word is storyteller.

1153
05:13:40,090 --> 05:13:55,880
Thank you. I'm putting that in my Twitter bio. German nine eight five visionary storyteller

1154
05:13:57,299 --> 05:14:23,590
streamer liquidator of retirement accounts. So you're a Virgo. Oh yeah. Well, Ray,

1155
05:14:23,590 --> 05:14:33,930
Joel, you don't have to do that. Say hello when we're done here. Hey Yoda nine eight five. Thanks

1156
05:14:33,930 --> 05:14:39,049
to the two dollars and 81 cents. The year is 2,107. I checked my cybernetic implants and

1157
05:14:40,169 --> 05:14:45,369
see that German is streaming. He's on his death bed and sadly announces that this is his last

1158
05:14:45,369 --> 05:14:51,849
stream ever. He tells us not to be sad as he's lived a full happy life. His heartbeat monitor

1159
05:14:51,849 --> 05:14:59,700
goes flat and chat is filled with F's and germa Pluto's full high school marching band kicks in

1160
05:14:59,700 --> 05:15:05,509
the door and begins filling the room blasting the pirate spy song. President Elbertson dies

1161
05:15:05,509 --> 05:15:33,959
like a true clown beloved. That's sad. Thanks to the two dollars and 81 cents. Hey reant deliriation.

1162
05:15:33,959 --> 05:15:39,290
Thanks for the thousand bits. Germa said, give more money. I'll take it. But I never said that.

1163
05:15:39,669 --> 05:15:44,069
Thanks for the 10 bucks. King sherbert nine 87. Thanks for the three bucks. Shut up and take my

1164
05:15:44,069 --> 05:15:49,669
bits. I'll take them. I'll take them. Thank you. Chunky baloney. Thanks for the 500 bits. Everyone

1165
05:15:49,669 --> 05:15:55,990
hurry and give him bits while we still can. Thanks for the five dollars. Chunky baloney. Unnecessary.

1166
05:15:55,990 --> 05:16:01,979
Don't worry. You don't have to give me money ever. And I know that that's like oh he says that. He's

1167
05:16:01,979 --> 05:16:07,240
saying that and then people are going to do it. Don't feel obligated to give me money. You don't

1168
05:16:07,240 --> 05:16:18,229
have to. Look at how good look at how good I am. I know. I know. Look. Trust me. But you don't have

1169
05:16:18,229 --> 05:16:32,409
to. You really don't. If you do then I'll take it. Thank you. Okay. I won't give you money. Now what?

1170
05:16:33,130 --> 05:16:41,180
Hey evil fish. Thanks to 250. If you had access to a movie production crew, a well-connected

1171
05:16:41,180 --> 05:16:44,619
casting director and a few. I just broke my headphones because I'm sitting there playing

1172
05:16:44,619 --> 05:16:51,509
with them. Same exact thing happened to the last ones. Ah damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I

1173
05:16:51,509 --> 05:16:55,830
broke the thing in half. It's okay. It's the other. It's the left headphone. I played with

1174
05:16:55,830 --> 05:17:00,650
it too much and I broke the jelly thing. Whoops. If you had access to a movie production crew,

1175
05:17:00,650 --> 05:17:03,689
well-connected casting director and a few million dollars, what sort of movie would you make?

1176
05:17:03,689 --> 05:17:11,930
I would make a Jerma Rumble live action too. Here's a joke that will never make it into a

1177
05:17:11,930 --> 05:17:20,180
Jerma Rumble but um this is the this is this is a two million dollar joke. I want to do it really

1178
05:17:20,180 --> 05:17:26,409
bad but here's a here's a this is this is written down. I wanted one of the contestants to be a

1179
05:17:26,409 --> 05:17:39,529
school bus that just drives into the ring. Oh here comes a school bus and it just drives up and like

1180
05:17:39,529 --> 05:17:45,900
fucking runs the whole ring over and the ring is ruined but they people are still getting

1181
05:17:45,900 --> 05:17:57,639
eliminated and stuff like the ring is collapsed but people are still like having to somehow find

1182
05:17:57,639 --> 05:18:02,599
a way to like throw people over the top rope even though it's on the ground. Two people like two

1183
05:18:02,599 --> 05:18:08,119
people hold up the top rope you know like we're gonna eliminate this guy he's too good one person

1184
05:18:08,119 --> 05:18:15,209
holds one side one person holds the other taut and like just to be able to eliminate him yeah that's

1185
05:18:15,290 --> 05:18:22,150
like a that would be that would be a ton of money that was written down that's one of the things

1186
05:18:22,150 --> 05:18:32,439
it's not gonna happen ever though. You have to throw the bus off the top rope and there'd be

1187
05:18:32,439 --> 05:18:39,740
there'd be somebody driving the bus that's like silhouetted out and they never come out like the

1188
05:18:39,740 --> 05:18:45,180
camera will pan around there's like a guy in there just sitting there like just without like an

1189
05:18:45,180 --> 05:18:50,419
emotionless face he's just sitting there driving the bus. Is he the contestant or is it the bus?

1190
05:18:50,580 --> 05:19:14,139
It's the bus but that guy never comes out. NPC bus driver why are you linking me a monster ebay link?

1191
05:19:23,900 --> 05:19:40,040
But you have to understand a free local pickup look just hurry up and liquidate your retirement

1192
05:19:40,040 --> 05:19:46,950
account I want to do it so bad so you'll know you'll know if I got what I wanted like in quotes

1193
05:19:46,950 --> 05:19:53,189
creatively speaking if a school bus runs the fucking ring over at some point in live rumble

1194
05:19:53,189 --> 05:20:31,720
2 keep an eye out and it would just go on as if it was normal for a while there's like another

1195
05:20:31,720 --> 05:20:39,750
thought of like oh the it's fucking ruined it's destroyed oh I can't I want to tell you this part

1196
05:20:39,750 --> 05:20:47,959
oh but it's it's so fucking funny it's the funniest thing that I've I've I've ever thought of

1197
05:20:47,959 --> 05:20:58,119
and I don't care if wow he thinks he's funny yes this one's funny no this one will happen

1198
05:20:58,119 --> 05:21:08,659
is somebody gonna suplex the bus can you imagine fucking like getting cranes

1199
05:21:09,380 --> 05:21:18,680
it happened like it'd be able to have the bus get suplexed somebody could get brushed I don't

1200
05:21:23,240 --> 05:21:35,860
that's not gonna happen someone could be in serious danger no the bus runs over the ring

1201
05:21:37,340 --> 05:21:41,259
and then in real time while they're still wrestling in the in the ring

1202
05:21:42,819 --> 05:21:47,700
immediately a construction crew is called to build a second ring next to the ring that was

1203
05:21:47,700 --> 05:21:55,049
destroyed and then they move to the next one and somebody accidentally eliminates themselves

1204
05:21:55,049 --> 05:21:57,689
because they've walked over the top rope because they was doing we could all right

1205
05:21:57,689 --> 05:22:01,770
everybody get over to the next one hurry the fuck up get like the referees and like the guy that

1206
05:22:01,770 --> 05:22:07,819
was doing really good at the time like steps over the top rope okay he's out stop spoiling

1210
05:22:45,159 --> 05:22:51,240

1211
05:22:51,240 --> 05:22:56,759
from a sponsorship right or something somebody stuff like that these are all like fun hypotheticals

1212
05:22:56,759 --> 05:23:00,680
to tell you like oh he's spoiling no I mean that's you're talking about that's that's

1213
05:23:01,639 --> 05:23:05,560
probably hundreds of thousands of dollars like let's be real to get something like that to be

1214
05:23:05,560 --> 05:23:10,680
a reality it's just it's a lot and I don't know I did that's why in case it doesn't happen yeah

the school bus thing the school bus driving into the ring no the school bus school bus getting

1230
05:25:57,340 --> 05:26:08,439

1231
05:26:08,439 --> 05:26:19,659

get over and like lift it and lift it out of the ring and roll it out of the ring yeah the driver

1233
05:26:28,919 --> 05:26:35,080
is still emotionless there would be a at least two or three close-ups of this dude driving the bus

1234
05:26:35,880 --> 05:26:39,799
while even like in the air being suplexed and he's just like kind of putting his like fingers on

1249
05:29:14,299 --> 05:29:26,939
it though I could probably I would probably I would probably just tone it down maybe eventually

1250
05:29:26,939 --> 05:29:33,700
over the years instead of streaming like three four days a week or four days a week or so but

1251
05:29:33,700 --> 05:29:42,419
I would probably just just to kind of be a presence I'd still be around you gotta make the last stream

1252
05:29:42,419 --> 05:29:59,509
a wild one yeah I mean it's not gonna happen anytime soon but it is gonna happen I would

1253
05:29:59,509 --> 05:30:06,700
tone it down first before I really was like all right bye I would stream like I don't know

1254
05:30:06,700 --> 05:30:10,700
once I got to the point where I was like all right this has been really fun but it's time for me to

1255
05:30:10,700 --> 05:30:17,540
step down I don't know I probably stream like once or twice a week I wouldn't just disappear

1256
05:30:18,340 --> 05:30:26,680
I would slowly be like all right guys I'm gonna take some time and I can't believe no this guy
