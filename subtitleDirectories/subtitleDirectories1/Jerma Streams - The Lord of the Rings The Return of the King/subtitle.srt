1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:06,820
Wait, you put a wink in? I hadn't come on. I didn't even remember how to stream. Hold on a second.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:15,269
All right. I just did the thing. And when you do that thing, that's how you know it's time to clean

3
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,420
your room. What I've done is I stacked a glass on top of another glass, because there's no room for

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:33,060
two glasses. So it's time. It's time to clean this room. So we have a wink. Of course we do.

5
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:38,579
In five seconds. Disgusting pigsty. No, no, I know this. It's not that bad. This just

6
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,820
documents all over the floor of all my personal information. PlayStation 2 games and glassware

7
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,060
everywhere. It's not like it's dirty. It's just stuff. That's one thing I want to make sure. I

8
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,829
want to talk to you guys about this before. I know there's a wink. We'll get it. Dirty versus

9
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:04,439
clutter. Your room, my room's not dirty. It's just cluttered. There's nothing in here that's

10
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:12,969
disgusting. It's just stuff on the ground. So why then? Actually, no, hold on. Never mind. That's

11
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:25,659
a lie. There's a... Fuck. I lose. There's a glass of coffee in it. That's definitely been sitting

12
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:31,859
there for like at least five days. All right. I lose. I can clean the room. That's fucking

13
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:38,939
horrible. I just looked behind me and saw it. But anyways, I had a good break. A lot of friends

14
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:49,620
came up. We had a good time and moldy. No, no, no, it's not. It's not. It's fine. We'll clean it

15
00:01:49,620 --> 00:02:31,270
right now. It's fine. It's fine. No, it's going to be fine. All right. All right. We're good.

16
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:42,550
Watering. I went, we dumped it. The mold got him. There's no mold. Okay. There's no mold in that

17
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:49,719
cup. Hold on. I got a wink. This is a spoiler. You're not supposed to see this shit yet.

18
00:02:50,039 --> 00:03:24,150
Hey, what are we doing? All right. That was the entire right side of a magazine. If you have like

19
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:33,379
the Cosmopolitan magazine, that was the entire right page for a fucking scent ad. You just

20
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:42,180
put text to it that says like stunning, daring, smells, and then like dot, dot, dot. Invigoration,

21
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:51,620
whatever the hell you think. A whole page ad. Fuck off with these whole page ads. You want to know

22
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,580
why nobody reads magazines anymore? Because the thing is 35 pages thick and there's 18 pages of

23
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:13,000
ads. That's why nobody reads them anymore. I winked. I winked like three times. Dude, I can't imagine

24
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,879
having a magazine company right now and the only people that read it are people that have

25
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:27,160
phones that are about to die at the doctor's office and they don't want to sit there and read

26
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:40,220
their phones. It's like, fuck, I have to read something else here. I forgot the Lord of the

27
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:46,300
Rings was in the background. Sorry. Hey, let me redo that one. You heard it. The only people

28
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,860
that read magazines are people that are bored at the doctor's office that don't want to fucking

29
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,860
know you heard it. I'm going to play Lord of the Rings Return of the King on PlayStation 2 today

30
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,819
and I felt it was appropriate. I'm returning to streaming after about eight or nine days,

31
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,180
so we're going to return to the king. Now it's too quiet. I'll fix it. Don't worry.

32
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:13,529
I'm going to explain why you are late. No, that's a pre-stream thing. That's a pre-stream thing and

33
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:22,389
now we'll find it'll be a now stream thing. I hate starting an activity where I know I'm going to be

34
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:27,620
long-term locked in, but it doesn't matter what it is. I could be going fishing for all that matters

35
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,420
and if I have a dump building, that's a bad way to put it. Let's be medical about this.

36
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:44,329
If I have to use the bathroom imminently, I do not want to do anything until that is taken care

37
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:54,019
of. It doesn't matter what it is. So I had to take care of that before I started my live stream,

38
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,180
because if you do not take care of that, if you do not let the process get started and finish,

39
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:05,189
then you are stuck. You are stuck needing to go use the restroom. You have to use the bathroom

40
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:10,939
at some point in an opportunity that might not be the greatest time. I hate that. No,

41
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:16,199
it doesn't happen to me. The reason why it happened today is because I ate food after 11

42
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,079
o'clock last night, which is like, come on, what am I thinking? That's how you make that happen.

43
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,500
All right, I'm going to play. No, I didn't even have a tweet. Hold on. No, it's because I had to

44
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:38,660
wink. Go back to the intro. We're not ready. Oh, we have huge bits coming in too. Bilactery gave...

45
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:45,139
Let me get the good one. Hold on. Let me get the good one out. Why am I... What are these pictures

46
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:50,149
on my phone? What am I doing? All right, hold on. All right, I'll be right back. I'm up.

47
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,649
Okay, this is funny to me because if you just browse your Twitter and you knew that I... Oh,

48
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,170
yeah, that's right. Durham has been gone. Durham has been gone for like 10 days.

49
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:24,759
The first tweet is, return of the king. And then a link to my Twitch. How many people might just

50
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,740
scroll by them and be like, really, dude? Like, return of the fucking king. Oh, wow. You were

51
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:37,509
gone for like a week and a half. You're the best. Yeah, return of the king. Whatever. All right,

52
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:47,819
what does everybody ask? No, somebody gave me money. Here's the worst part about when you don't...

53
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:55,420
Okay, I haven't turned my computer on for 10 days. So how many updates does your computer fucking

54
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,740
have to do? You just don't even realize just how much shit your computer does in the background.

55
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:11,000
10 days of no updates and no downloads and shit. It's so obnoxious. Anyway, Spylactery gave $50.

56
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:22,470
Wait, we losing friends? No, we're not. Why'd you say clocks? They say, glad you're back,

57
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,990
Jerma. I was watching your old Stardew Valley streams and holy shit, you were bad at the game.

58
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,509
You've grown a lot as a streamer and we're all very proud of my boy.

59
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:42,950
I'm not... It's all right. It's okay. And 15 community subs from Amferic. Thanks, Amferic.

60
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:53,690
Yeah, welcome back, everybody. You didn't forget about me. That's good. A weekend on the internet

61
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,169
is like three years real time. You know what I mean? I'm surprised everyone even knows who I am.

62
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:12,379
But thank you, Spylactery. Thank you, Amferic. This time. Lord of the Rings for the return of

63
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:23,379
the king on PlayStation 2. I'm ready. A little blurry, but what am I going to do?

64
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,740
We're not playing on hard. This is not going to be a 16-hour stream.

65
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:38,309
Lord of the Rings, return of the king. I'm not playing on hard. We're doing normal. Here we go.

66
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:45,210
Adventure MFDN 5 community subs. Thank you, Dan. Played on hard. Did you see how fucking horrible

67
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,700
this game was the last one? You don't want me to do this on hard. I don't want to do this on hard.

68
00:09:50,980 --> 00:10:02,659
No. Why would I do that? I'm not going to do that. Here we go. Lord of the Rings, the return of the

69
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:11,610
king. We last left our heroes when they were having a good time. Of course, it's a fucking THX

70
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:23,379
at the beginning of the THX certified game. Good. Did it break the speakers?

71
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:33,110
You did the THX sound too loud. You broke the speakers. Do you ever think the guy in

72
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,269
the projection room during the THX sound is going like, oh fuck, oh fuck, it's going to happen?

73
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,500
Now what? Why is this so soft? Come on, Batman. Thanks for the 10 subs.

74
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:55,429
I think it actually did break the speakers. Why does this sound like tinny? Does it sound

75
00:10:55,429 --> 00:11:13,029
tinny to anybody else? It sounds tinny. Why does it sound like it's coming down a hallway?

76
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:23,769
It's actually broken. I can't even hear this.

77
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:37,580
A hanostanet of the enemy is growing. What? Sauron will use his puppet son-man to destroy the people

78
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:44,460
of Rohan. My headphones weren't plugged in all the way. It's been a week, guys.

79
00:11:51,610 --> 00:12:09,000
Here we go. Another old movie. Here comes the DM. No, don't DMCA. This is a cut scene in the game.

80
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:24,629
Yeah, this is when we last left our heroes at the Battle of Home Depot.

81
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:39,480
You know what's funny about this stream? I'm going to be really honest with you.

82
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:47,929
The only reason why I'm playing this is because I bought it. I didn't want to play this,

83
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:54,220
but I can't not play it. I bought all three of them together.

84
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:02,379
The wizard is never late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he needs to.

85
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:07,259
Somebody do it. Do it. Do late. That's the line right there. That's actually the line.

86
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:19,019
Screamer is never late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he accidentally forgets

87
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:25,500
to eat and might have a shit building up in him for three hours and can't start on time.

88
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:41,000
Seamless transition. Let's go. I get to play as Gandalf, too.

89
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,269
I already leveled up. I'm already in perfect mode.

90
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:07,960
Why does Gandalf look like this Star Wars kid? He's kind of flailing around.

91
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:31,399
That was kind of fun. What has Gandalf's staff made out of? Wood? Is it wood? Well,

92
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,440
I have to play as Gandalf the whole game. I don't care what any other character does.

93
00:14:39,210 --> 00:15:02,980
Probably wood. Ranged. I'm gonna die. What the hell was I doing? Wait, blow it up from back here?

94
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:12,070
Gandalf gameplay, Resident Sleeper. You mean Gandalf gameplay, guaranteed victory.

95
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:20,519
I guess that is Resident Sleeper. Shit, you're right. I was wrong there. All right, what am I

96
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:42,389
doing? R1, action. All right, I gotta be careful. Did I get it? Did I not get it? I just didn't hit

97
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:57,019
anybody. What the fuck am I doing? What is Gandalf throwing spears at me? I have magical powers.

98
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:08,539
Why would I need to do this? Oh, there we go. Yeah, I gotta get rid of that. I'm gonna die.

99
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:35,320
Can Gandalf die? Give us Frodo. Frodo's not even in this game. What do you mean? No,

100
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,480
we don't give spoilers. No, we can talk spoilers. We can talk. You've seen the last two movies. We

101
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:54,919
played them on stream. Yes, I did. I played Fellowship of the Ring and I played two towers

102
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:13,049
on stream. We watched them. You... No one watched it, though. I mean, no one watched you. The skill

103
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:16,410
meter determines the kill rating. Earn higher ratings by swinging to get the successful hits.

104
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,890
Best song in the... Best song? This song right here could potentially be the best song that has

105
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:31,640
been written since like the 1700s. Fair ratings are the easiest to get, but generate the fewest

106
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:42,420
experience points. Good and excellent ratings are worth more. Yeah, I know how to do that. We've

107
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:49,960
seen the last movie. We already know how this works. Remember, won't read this comment? Well,

108
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,180
now you owe me a thousand dollars. Was that on the line? I don't know. Pushing the skill

109
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,779
meter into perfect will enhance your attack damage and generate maximum experience points.

110
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:14,170
Hey. Hey, welcome back, guys. It's been a while. How are you doing? I only got two perfects. How?

111
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:24,970
So we... Is Gandalf... Is Gandalf resident sleeper? I'm not playing as Gimli again. He's the worst

112
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:39,049
character in the game. Look at this. Oh, you can do it for all. You can do it for all. I know this...

113
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:47,990
I know this is... We usually don't stop the stream for the typical... When I say typical,

114
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:53,990
I mean like a typical like one sub or one donation. We usually don't do that, but I have to stop here.

115
00:18:54,789 --> 00:19:00,099
Um, it's Marvash McGally says, it's good seeing you play one of my childhood games. I completed

116
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:06,619
this when I was 12. You better finish this. Thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents though. That's...

117
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:28,759
I had to read that because I've just been called out. So 15 hours stream. This is not going to be

118
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,210
a 15 hour stream. You know why that is? This is important. I haven't talked about this. I've...

119
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:39,210
I start physical therapy this week. If I lock myself in here for 15 hours today and I go to

120
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:45,609
physical therapy, I'm going to have to explain to the doctor that I... How long have you been

121
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:52,279
sitting in that chair? Uh, I usually six, six to seven hours. That's... Oh, but you do stretches?

122
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:58,599
Yeah, I try to. What about last night? 15 hours? No, I'm not going to the doctor with that info.

123
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:18,309
Just lie. Don't you know? What's that old saying? This, this three people you don't lie to? Your

124
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:26,819
doctor, your financial advisor, and your lawyer, and your wife, and your husband. It's a five.

125
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:43,799
And your mother. And don't lie to your parents. Uh, don't lie. No, just don't lie to anybody. Okay,

126
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:51,180
all right. I gotta pay attention. 6900 points. Orc Hewer. I mean, this is just... Everybody needs

127
00:20:51,180 --> 00:21:08,470
this. X, X. Yeah, this is a standard combo. It's cheap if a Gandalf though. Yeah, I'm just playing.

128
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,859
I want to play with Gandalf. Wait, hold on. You can play as the hobbits? I don't remember that.

129
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:28,900
That's... interests me for some reason. I don't know why. Okay, looks good. Replay? No. How do

130
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,339
I get the hell out of here? How do I continue? I see continue down there. Do I have to go all

131
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:50,599
the way down? Shit. Play as Sam. I'm probably gonna get my ass kicked if I play with Sam.

132
00:21:51,160 --> 00:22:03,579
I don't think I'm into that. I'll be honest. You want me to beat the final level?

133
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:11,019
The last free kingdom of men. His war on this country will come swiftly.

134
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,740
He senses the ring will draw close and the strength of the ring bearer will fail.

135
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:27,420
Oh, let me get this on screen. It's great. In the end, this war must be decided by the

136
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,859
smallest of things. Imagine somebody laughing at the Lord of the Rings movie like this.

137
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:37,019
The ring wanted to be found. Here's... Oh boy. The task began when I beheld it upon the floor of...

138
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:42,140
Sad story. Somebody's entire... Imagine watching Lord of the Rings in the theaters

139
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,819
when people were screaming and cheering and yelling at every fucking other line.

140
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,309
Somebody had their movie ruined, one of the best franchises ever, by being in the movie theater

141
00:22:52,309 --> 00:23:00,680
watching it like on launch. Still questions needed answering. Secrets only Minas Tirith,

142
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:08,650
ancient city of men could reveal. The year 3434 of the second age who follows the account will be

143
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:16,390
Should I have to press a few beeps here to get this on screen?

144
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,960
It has come to me. The one ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

145
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,380
All those who follow in my bloodline shall be brisk.

146
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,509
It is precious to me.

147
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,259
It was in this moment... This is the future of movies, guys.

148
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:48,759
I would weave a plan for a great war, yet count upon others...

149
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,799
In movie advertising. They're just not going to care anymore.

150
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:56,599
It was the destiny of Aragorn, heir to the throne, to lead this war.

151
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,779
Let me see that again. I once saw warriors of every race

152
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,259
fighting as companions alongside him.

153
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:05,539
This is good. I like it. Together we would spring a great trap.

154
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,380
All right. If I made this... Okay. If I made a streamer cologne.

155
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,000
No one's done that shit. People sell fucking mice.

156
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:18,519
Gaming keyboards. No, no, no. What if I sold a cologne?

157
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,059
People need to branch out, man. It's not all about your gamer chair.

158
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,930
It's about, like, a nice fucking eau de toileur.

159
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,390
For they, like us, will be in great peril.

160
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:38,150
Cologne that smells like me. No, that's strange.

161
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,829
I'm not... No, absolutely not.

162
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:42,230
It would be a cologne that I would think would... I...

163
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:49,589
That smells good. And that scent would be...

164
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,029
It would be a combination of a couple things.

165
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:54,950
It would be... Right when you pull open a green jolly rancher,

166
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,029
that immediate scent that hits your nostrils.

167
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,309
That'd be... It'd be in there somewhere.

168
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:00,710
Like, that green apple smell would be there.

169
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,279
Surrounded by a nice eau de.

170
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:09,079
And then wood. Like a wood smell.

171
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,359
Like a burning wood smell.

172
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,819
You know that when you have a campfire going,

173
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:16,380
you get that wood burn smell?

174
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:18,819
I think it would be pretty good.

175
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,309
All right. Path of the King.

176
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,549
I think... It's like a backwards level skill tree here.

177
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:28,390
Escape from Osgiloth.

178
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:33,269
Those of you guys don't know what eau de is.

179
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,980
OED. I'm dead serious.

180
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:41,900
People think... Don't tell me I'm crazy until you smell it.

181
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,740
Eau de is an incredible smell.

182
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,500
It's like one of the best scents ever made.

183
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,299
It's incredible.

184
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:50,700
OED. Smell it.

185
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,829
Path of the Dead.

186
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,180
Oh, is this the one... The storyline that Peter Jackson

187
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,660
wished he deleted from the whole entire movie?

188
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:08,500
Let's do this one.

189
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,259
Locked? Who are the other characters?

190
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,220
There are three secret fucking characters?

191
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,180
Why is Gandalf locked?

192
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,019
I just unlocked him.

193
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,049
He wasn't in that fight.

194
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:43,529
Oh, it's because you have the trial version.

195
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
This is the demo disc.

196
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,450
Okay, guys, sorry.

197
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,329
I only got like the first two levels and two characters.

198
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,369
Oh, by the way, I'm going to play through this

199
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,009
two level demo a hundred times.

200
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:07,609
Welcome to 1996.

201
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,380
Adam Sildur's heir received the ring of power

202
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,410
and also carries before him

203
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,289
the only weapon Sauron cannot abide

204
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:25,460
and the only power before which a dead king and his army...

205
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,859
I have to have my soul to fucking goddamn scent.

206
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:29,539
I got to look into this.

207
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,990
I'm going to look into this.

208
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,869
That's funny to me.

209
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:34,710
That's funny enough for me to set my eyes on it

210
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,390
and lose a shitload of money and do it.

211
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,259
Deep inside this haunted mountain,

212
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,140
they will face terrible trials.

213
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,009
They must overcome the wrath of an ancient, cursed realm

214
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:49,450
and summon forth its king.

215
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,380
Out of darkness, Aragorn must call an army

216
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,859
even Sauron's horde cannot withstand.

217
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:59,220
Call it Jurfium.

218
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,099
No, that's weird.

219
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,779
The living cannot defend Minas Tirith

220
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:07,299
without the fury of those long dead.

221
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:09,619
I'm going to call it Liquid Mold.

222
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,819
You think anyone would spray it near their face?

223
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:26,259
The dead linger on this path, but we must walk it to the end.

224
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:27,779
Hold on.

225
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,299
Just practicing.

226
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,420
Oh yeah, you have no camera control on this.

227
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,900
I forgot.

228
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,779
All right, I got to be careful.

229
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:43,430
The way is shut.

230
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,069
It is made for those who are dead.

231
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,779
Yeah, Peter Jackson wished he deleted this entire sequence, right?

232
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,380
He hated this part.

233
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,099
He was like, that's the biggest mistake of my whole career.

234
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:01,960
You know, he really said that.

235
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,319
He actually like talked about that.

236
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:13,609
I swear to God, he actually just hit me.

237
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:23,819
Oh, what?

238
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:24,380
I couldn't kill it.

239
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:27,509
It's kind of hard to see.

240
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,500
German knows Peter Jackson.

241
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,599
No, I just know of the YouTube video I clicked on

242
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,279
that talked about in the article

243
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,599
about how he didn't like this scene

244
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,680
and he didn't like this whole sequence.

245
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:57,130
Come on, land, land, do something.

246
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,730
Oh God, he never said that.

247
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:01,690
Yes, he did.

248
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:16,339
Jesus, this is very ugly.

249
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:17,940
Why is this uglier than the last one?

250
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,650
Am I misremembering things

251
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,569
or is this actually uglier than the second game?

252
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:24,619
It's the same console.

253
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:33,589
I feel like I'm watching a YouTube playthrough

254
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:35,589
of this game that was uploaded in 2007.

255
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:38,089
Is it not?

256
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,849
Why does this look so bad?

257
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:53,769
All right, we need some blocks.

258
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:00,299
Break this, right?

259
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,980
Nice emulator.

260
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,339
This is not on an emulator.

261
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,180
This is on PlayStation 2, slim edition.

262
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,200
I might actually turn it up.

263
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,240
I think I'm actually going to go

264
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,039
and do some adjustments.

265
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,660
All right, hold on.

266
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,539
It's because it's dark.

267
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:21,460
All right, you got that image, right?

268
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,819
Let's do some adjustments.

269
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:28,759
Okay.

270
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,119
All right, looking better.

271
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,779
A little bit more contrast.

272
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,779
How's that saturation?

273
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:40,819
A little bit deeper.

274
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:55,720
That actually looks a lot better.

275
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,200
Yeah, because this is where it was before.

276
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,640
That's why it looks so fucking wrong.

277
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,759
It's like dark.

278
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,809
Had bad contrast.

279
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:07,109
Look it up with an HDMI LOL.

280
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,960
You think there's an HDMI on the back

281
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
of my PlayStation 2 slim edition?

282
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,710
Can I throw?

283
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,190
Yeah, I can.

284
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,750
How do I throw?

285
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,019
You guys could like not watch me do this and help.

286
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,000
It's an upscaler.

287
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,039
It's on an upscaler right now.

288
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,650
I play all the old consoles through an upscaler.

289
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,859
So I think it's kind of an ugly portion of the game.

290
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,619
The first sequence didn't look like this.

291
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,309
Like the battle of Home Depot didn't look like this.

292
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:10,660
Killed.

293
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:17,670
It's the battle of lows now.

294
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,779
Come on, build up the pits and perfects.

295
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,380
This is perfect cheesing.

296
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,099
This is how you do it.

297
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,740
Just stand in the middle and just bam, square.

298
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,710
Break a shield.

299
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:46,759
You know what else it is?

300
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:49,480
They're surrounded by this ugly goo.

301
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:07,140
Yard sale.

302
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,960
No, this is not a yard sale brawl.

303
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,289
Why would a yard sale be in a cave?

304
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:23,539
Yeah, that's the problem.

305
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,699
There's no video game on the screen.

306
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,099
There's just weird pixelated green water.

307
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:35,880
They might unlock a move.

308
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,539
What's it?

309
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,380
It's X, X, A.

310
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,739
No, X, X, triangle.

311
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,889
Didn't I unlock it for everybody?

312
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,900
Did I just grab the ring?

313
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,340
All right.

314
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,280
Can I put one of you guys on this?

315
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:14,219
No, don't mind.

316
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,019
Just go ahead.

317
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:15,820
Go on, guys.

318
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,630
I'll just do fucking everything.

319
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:26,539
They just do.

320
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:27,739
They're just up there vibing.

321
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,980
Yeah, let's get the fuck down here.

322
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,099
Oh, God.

323
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,780
Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.

324
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,400
Let's go.

325
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:53,880
Build it up.

326
00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:02,230
Did I get it?

327
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,030
Got it.

328
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:10,889
I can't even get over there.

329
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:17,579
I get it finally.

330
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,059
I can't even go over here.

331
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,719
Nice PS2 Slim Edition.

332
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:28,219
Don't make...

333
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,300
The PS2 Slim Edition is an amazing console,

334
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,420
which would literally fit anywhere.

335
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:36,170
You know the weird places I had to put this fucking thing

336
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,050
when I was in my bedroom?

337
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,550
This thing could fit anywhere.

338
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:52,119
The PS2 Slim Edition is as big as like eight credit cards.

339
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,800
It can go anywhere.

340
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:01,849
Can we move?

341
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:08,309
Did you put it in a Ziploc bag or something?

342
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,269
No, but you could stuff this somewhere behind like a bureau.

343
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:13,849
It fit everywhere.

344
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,980
You could go under your desk.

345
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:19,059
You could go on top of your desk.

346
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,170
What is this camera angle?

347
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,920
What is this camera?

348
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:32,949
I don't even know what's happening.

349
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:33,670
I think I'm winning.

350
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:46,920
Remember, please, stop you making chat.

351
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,559
What?

352
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,760
What are you talking about?

353
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,179
Is it clear on my end?

354
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:50,900
No, not at all.

355
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:59,400
Oh, there we go.

356
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,880
Finally.

357
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,199
Is it clear on your end?

358
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,320
No, no, it's not.

359
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,360
It looks like your end.

360
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:15,110
Bureau is French for desk.

361
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,309
Yeah, that's what I called it.

362
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:17,989
Am I weird for saying the word bureau now?

363
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,900
How much should I charge for the Cologne?

364
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,380
Should it be something stupid so nobody buys it?

365
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:41,340
No, I do have a combo.

366
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:51,320
I could do without it popping up on the screen every time.

367
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,619
Probably $20.

368
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,429
You don't think it should be like 80?

369
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:03,539
I'm only going to make like 10 of these.

370
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:11,369
You know, are you sure you don't want me to have articles written about me?

371
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,449
Streamer is such an egomaniac.

372
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,170
He has a $120 Cologne that he's selling.

373
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,690
I mean, that's publicity for the community.

374
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:36,809
Egomaniac.

375
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:42,090
I wonder how many bottles I could reliably actually get to manufacture.

376
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,309
Look, if you buy one of these Colognes, you'll...

377
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:51,900
They last a long time.

378
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,380
Guys, I've bought Cologne that I still have since high school.

379
00:39:55,099 --> 00:40:05,849
I swear to God.

380
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,179
15-year-old Cologne.

381
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:14,659
More than that.

382
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:18,059
Try like 20.

383
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:19,579
What the fuck is going on right now?

384
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:20,380
What?

385
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,139
Am I dead?

386
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,469
I just got like trapped in the corner.

387
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,150
Nice Aragon.

388
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,710
Good job.

389
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:30,630
Good work, Aragon.

390
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,710
Or Legolas, whichever one of you.

391
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,349
Good job.

392
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,030
You're doing great.

393
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:50,760
Give me a break.

394
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,780
This is why we need you to be Sam.

395
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,920
Am I going to be the first person that beats this game as Samwise?

396
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:06,010
Does he even have any combos?

397
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,179
Does Sam have a combo?

398
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:12,489
I feel like...

399
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:15,130
So Triangle is Fierce Attack.

400
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,969
X is Light Attack.

401
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,730
Square is Parry.

402
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,449
Right?

403
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:22,570
Why do I feel like he's going to have a stab with X and then...

404
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:23,769
Oh!

405
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:24,409
Oh!

406
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:24,809
Oh!

407
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:25,130
Oh!

408
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,010
Oh!

409
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,130
Instead of any other moves.

410
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,610
Like it'll be...

411
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,489
I can make him say ooh.

412
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:38,630
Get in here and help.

413
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:43,320
There's a funny ooh noise.

414
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,719
Thank you.

415
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:46,599
Make sure you buy a Cologne on your way out.

416
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,400
They're only $100.

417
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:57,539
All fair.

418
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:05,420
Ooh, what's this?

419
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,860
What is this?

420
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,980
Is it a rock?

421
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,170
Oh, that's what we needed to do.

422
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:17,860
Cool.

423
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:22,619
I remember playing this level when I was younger

424
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,099
and having Perfect almost the entire time I played.

425
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,829
How the fuck did I do that?

426
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,360
That almost seems...

427
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,980
Like, not even achievable.

428
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,739
Dude, that was pretty good.

429
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,059
Dude, almost there.

430
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:49,380
Come on!

431
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,489
Oh, you idiots.

432
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,849
I had it.

433
00:42:57,849 --> 00:42:59,050
Normal is easy.

434
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,820
Yeah, that's true.

435
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,619
Hey, Jerma sucks.

436
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,139
Thanks for saying I suck.

437
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:06,780
Thanks for the five community suck subs.

438
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,179
Thank you.

439
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:13,530
Let me get out of here.

440
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:23,320
We're not down here.

441
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:23,880
I'll come down.

442
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:26,679
Thanks for the subs.

443
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:34,039
Oh, here's the thing.

444
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,199
Okay, let's say I make this Cologne.

445
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,320
I know I'm on the Cologne thing,

446
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,039
but you gotta give me...

447
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:38,599
Just give me a sec.

448
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,000
Let's say I make this Cologne

449
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,960
and it turns out like, holy shit,

450
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,599
it's actually...

451
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,800
What a combination of scents.

452
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,960
This is fucking fantastic.

453
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,559
This is actually really good.

454
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,079
And I don't know,

455
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,519
some celebrity gets ahold of it.

456
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,610
Do I just sell the rights to them?

457
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,489
Like a million dollars?

458
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:07,289
But they can just like change the name.

459
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:08,409
Whatever.

460
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,849
And then I can hire Danny DeVito

461
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,969
to be in a skit.

462
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:17,139
That's the long con here.

463
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:18,739
That's the long game here, guys.

464
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:32,550
That's the sellout move.

465
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,670
No, it's dodgy.

466
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:37,900
All right.

467
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,300
Come on.

468
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:38,699
Perfect.

469
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,239
Perfect.

470
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,650
It's like there's not enough of them

471
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,610
for me to get perfect.

472
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,570
It is on normal, though.

473
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:48,969
That's right.

474
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:50,969
Of course, another great point.

475
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,699
Or fewer.

476
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:13,849
Come on.

477
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:14,489
Give me perfect.

478
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:18,179
God, it's right there.

479
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:18,579
Come on.

480
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:47,579
Oh, you motherfucker.

481
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,460
Level up.

482
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,190
This is it.

483
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,590
Perfect.

484
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,309
Perfect.

485
00:45:52,309 --> 00:46:00,179
Here we go.

486
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:01,219
Lots of fucking EXP.

487
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:12,010
Block it.

488
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:12,250
Good.

489
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:13,369
Nice.

490
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:14,969
All right.

491
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:15,369
We're good.

492
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:23,769
Just don't die.

493
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:24,889
Okay.

494
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:25,130
Please.

495
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,179
When I was a kid,

496
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:32,659
I used to think you could only use orc humor on orcs.

497
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:35,719
Well, I mean,

498
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:37,769
how old were you?

499
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:42,360
Were you over or under the age of 10?

500
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:47,829
I mean, that's not unreasonable.

501
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:58,760
I mean, can you,

502
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,559
either one of you two handle even one person?

503
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,239
You guys are worse than the last fucking co-op.

504
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:11,219
Is Legolas dead?

505
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:19,019
This game is awesome.

506
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:20,139
Yeah, they both really good.

507
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:30,809
The Lord of the Rings.

508
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,050
And the return of the king.

509
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,130
I keep looking over on the other monitor and just see that.

510
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,250
Oh, did you see that?

511
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:44,730
Oh, you didn't.

512
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:45,369
Did I block it?

513
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:10,380
Oh, it's just a cut scene.

514
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,300
Guys, don't DMCA this stream.

515
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:14,380
I didn't do anything.

516
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:24,090
How many purpose did I get?

517
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:24,570
Like five?

518
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,019
Mission rating.

519
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:33,340
Good.

520
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:41,130
All right.

521
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:42,820
Level three.

522
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:43,940
I...

523
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:46,469
Let's go.

524
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:48,070
I'll go over it all.

525
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,510
Final judgment.

526
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,039
I don't want to play as Gimli.

527
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:00,699
Rising of revenge.

528
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,619
You are Gimli main.

529
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:07,340
No, I'm not.

530
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:09,340
Strength of stone.

531
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,619
Permanently increases your health.

532
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:15,369
Lonely mountain lore.

533
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,719
Increase damage and get to perfect mode more quickly.

534
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:27,059
I'm doing health.

535
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:33,780
Okay.

536
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:38,780
Doing all...

537
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,980
I don't want to play as Gimli.

538
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,699
Gimli's not my main.

539
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:41,739
Did we get a T-pose right here?

540
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:44,409
I think we did for a second.

541
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,090
No, no, it was this.

542
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:46,409
Okay.

543
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,099
I never looked for that shit.

544
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,980
This is ever since I started streaming on Twitch.

545
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:56,969
I see them now.

546
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:02,309
I never even thought for a second.

547
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:05,849
But that was something to look for.

548
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,429
All right, let's go.

549
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:18,219
Who should put my points into?

550
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,429
Did you just say Gimli is your main?

551
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:23,429
I know, I said Gimli is not my main.

552
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,829
Game concept art.

553
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:32,630
Yeah, let's take a look.

554
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:37,610
We have to watch all of these.

555
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,360
No, hold on.

556
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,079
So this is the concept art for the game.

557
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,199
Not concept art for the movie.

558
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:47,079
Oh, that's bright.

559
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:52,820
Oh my god, this is horrible.

560
00:50:52,900 --> 00:51:01,610
Something's wrong with the capture here.

561
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:04,170
It's really not right at all.

562
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:08,440
Fix the gamma.

563
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,000
No, it's...

564
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,800
Hold on a second.

565
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,199
I think it's...

566
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,360
Oh, oh, oh!

567
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:13,960
Whoa, hold on.

568
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,260
Something's not right here.

569
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,539
What's going on with this shit?

570
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:22,739
Why is it doing this?

571
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,090
All right, hold on.

572
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,210
I need to turn this off for a second.

573
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:33,449
This is fucked up.

574
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,539
I don't know what's going on.

575
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:45,300
Is that better?

576
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:51,190
By hell, let me go back in here now.

577
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,389
I don't know what's going on with this thing.

578
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:55,880
Did it make it worse?

579
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:04,500
The cables are bad?

580
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,699
How the fuck did that happen?

581
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,699
I've been gone for eight days.

582
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:09,300
What, did they rot while I was gone?

583
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:25,030
Hold on.

584
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,059
Is that better?

585
00:52:27,699 --> 00:52:29,510
Maybe a little bit.

586
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:33,559
King of the Dead, the Southern Gate.

587
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,159
No, I gotta do all of them, right?

588
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:35,659
Yeah.

589
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:39,610
Road to Isengard.

590
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:42,300
Something's fucking wrong here.

591
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:44,219
Oh, I get to begin now.

592
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,179
That's like...

593
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:46,059
It looks a little better though.

594
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,989
So I took the cable and I bent it

595
00:52:51,989 --> 00:52:53,750
and twisted it and pulled on it.

596
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,949
I'm not going to touch it anymore.

597
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:03,510
I'm being Gandalf.

598
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:16,409
Cable and ball torture.

599
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:21,530
It was not a chance that brought Maddie and Bippin to Fangorn.

600
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:26,789
Run, Mary!

601
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:27,909
It's talking, Mary.

602
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:29,349
The tree is talking.

603
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:29,849
Tree?

604
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:33,110
I am no tree.

605
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,829
I am an ant.

606
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:43,989
Inks have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards

607
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,869
for a very long time.

608
00:53:48,389 --> 00:53:49,820
I love the word wizard.

609
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:51,900
Might be my favorite word.

610
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:08,809
This is pirate quality.

611
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,170
I really should just title this like Lord of the Rings.

612
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:18,010
Lord underscore of underscore the underscore rings underscore

613
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:24,329
like X2114 rip part one dot zip.

614
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:29,610
It does look like a torrented movie.

615
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:36,780
Actually does look better.

616
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,150
That guy got fucking disturbed.

617
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,389
That's being the first guy that runs alone to Gandalf

618
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:49,829
and be like, oh boy, you're done.

619
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:58,820
First to leave.

620
00:54:58,820 --> 00:54:59,780
Yeah, what a...

621
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,820
I love the crisp loop.

622
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,000
That guy was running.

623
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,500
Smart.

624
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,429
Get that guy up there.

625
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,070
No, I just blew that guy's head off.

626
00:55:15,739 --> 00:55:17,019
Gandalf, that was fucked up.

627
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:18,219
I'm trying to shoot the guy up here.

628
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:22,820
Let's just point blank that guy's head.

629
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,219
Hold on, can I?

630
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:27,860
Yes, I can.

631
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,139
Why would I even ask?

632
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:44,920
Here we go.

633
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,719
Let's get up here.

634
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:46,219
Come on.

635
00:55:48,409 --> 00:55:49,449
Is that Gandalf?

636
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,230
I don't know why I thought that was Gandalf talking.

637
00:55:58,469 --> 00:56:01,989
There he is.

638
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:06,789
Well, he's like, easy pickets back there.

639
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:07,289
Get him.

640
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,780
I was currently going and getting.

641
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:15,699
It sounded kind of like Gandalf.

642
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:29,019
And don't tell me I'm crazy because all video game voice acting is either we got the money to...

643
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,380
Ooh, hold on a second.

644
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,690
Come on, somebody.

645
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:35,530
I'm in perfect mode.

646
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,570
How dare you?

647
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:37,130
Come on.

648
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:37,530
No.

649
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,409
How dare you do this to me?

650
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,489
Fuck you.

651
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:44,300
Where am I?

652
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:50,659
What I was going to say is...

653
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,150
You either have the real actor there and you have the money for it or...

654
00:56:57,909 --> 00:56:59,510
The guy from accounting does Gandalf.

655
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:09,900
He's gonna stomp.

656
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,480
All right, I need perfects here.

657
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:24,840
Get out of the way.

658
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,480
God, get the fuck out of here.

659
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,849
You guys are blocking the screen.

660
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:46,250
Gandalf's got a really good orc cure.

661
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,699
Come on.

662
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:51,739
Spring it, spring it, spring it.

663
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,260
Nothing.

664
00:57:53,800 --> 00:58:06,250
Pick up.

665
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:10,539
No, get the fuck away from me.

666
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:10,940
I got this.

667
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,579
I got this.

668
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:12,079
Leave me alone.

669
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:23,260
Oh, come on.

670
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,699
Ooh, there it is again.

671
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:26,380
Thanks for stepping on me over and over again.

672
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:32,360
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

673
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:39,780
Before they destroy all...

674
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:45,480
Come on, come on.

675
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,619
Let's go, come on.

676
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:50,760
Get this out.

677
00:58:51,300 --> 00:59:00,019
Who the fuck are you aiming?

678
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,119
Star Wars wizard.

679
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:13,619
Is there any game that you can use?

680
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:14,119
Hold on.

681
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:20,250
I have to just get that nice and clean.

682
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:25,030
Should I play Jedi Fallen Order?

683
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:27,289
Somebody please tell me the truth.

684
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,460
I love lightsabers and I love Dark Souls games.

685
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,099
Like, how would I not like that game?

686
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:36,179
Is it really bad enough where you're like,

687
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:36,980
no, no, no, no.

688
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,619
It's like, suck.

689
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,340
That ticks every box for me.

690
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:54,119
Fallen Order is good.

691
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:55,000
One person just said it.

692
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,280
Did I believe them?

693
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,849
Wait a minute.

694
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,610
Did I believe that person?

695
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,750
Believe that person.

696
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:08,250
Okay.

697
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:09,510
Fuck that guy.

698
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:10,010
Don't...

699
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,309
Hey, come on.

700
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:13,449
You guys are sitting on the same train here.

701
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:21,190
You're not sitting on the subway

702
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:23,190
and somebody gets off at one at a stop

703
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,469
and you go, oh, fuck that stop.

704
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:25,110
Fuck that guy.

705
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:28,230
We're on the same train.

706
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:40,119
Shit, I didn't see...

707
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:41,320
This guy, this guy's like popped in.

708
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:50,150
Sitting on the scam train.

709
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:56,469
What the hell?

710
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:56,949
Is that health?

711
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,059
Ooh, come on.

712
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:03,800
Come on.

713
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,940
Oh, just excellent.

714
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,699
I might as well not even fucking try then.

715
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:12,250
Not even worth tweeting about.

716
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,070
Really?

717
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,980
Like, what the fuck?

718
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,860
Why am I supposed to go?

719
01:01:20,659 --> 01:01:31,019
No, it's gonna do the camera change.

720
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:31,519
Bullshit.

721
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,480
All right, got it.

722
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,760
I'm actually playing pretty well.

723
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,119
Remember last time I played this game?

724
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:45,800
Like the multivitamins working.

725
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:50,980
I started taking like a little

726
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,139
volti vitamin recently

727
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:54,500
and I think it's working.

728
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,860
Voldemort gummies.

729
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,989
That's never getting sent.

730
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:17,750
I'll take a perfect.

731
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:19,269
I'll take a perfect.

732
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:19,769
I'll take a...

733
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:25,639
Will you?

734
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:30,090
Will you do that, Gandalf?

735
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,030
Gandalf, is that what you're doing?

736
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:43,110
Gandalf, is that what we're doing here?

737
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,750
I don't know.

738
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,869
I don't think that's what we're doing here.

739
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,630
I thought that just said overachiever on it.

740
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,710
I was like, why are you calling me an overachiever?

741
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,340
I don't...

742
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,860
What, I put the end out?

743
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:55,900
How do I save him?

744
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:56,539
I don't know what to do.

745
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,949
I can't hit it.

746
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,949
Oh, I just have to protect him.

747
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,750
I didn't even see the archers on my cell phone camera.

748
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,250
Sorry.

749
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:25,300
Gandalf, best character, seriously.

750
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,579
Why would I ever play another character?

751
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:39,510
Anybody else?

752
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,829
Take it.

753
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:40,329
Come on, go.

754
01:03:45,219 --> 01:03:45,780
Sam.

755
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,260
Sam.

756
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:46,840
Sam.

757
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,820
But why would I want to play Sam when I can play as Gandalf?

758
01:03:58,059 --> 01:03:58,860
Sam gang.

759
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,500
Sam gang.

760
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,139
Sam gang.

761
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:00,639
Sam gang.

762
01:04:01,659 --> 01:04:02,780
All right, I will play as Sam.

763
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,280
I will.

764
01:04:04,059 --> 01:04:10,809
Did you get it?

765
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,559
Okay, I don't know what's going on.

766
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:23,320
I just started laughing about the cow throwing the rock.

767
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,320
And black and white.

768
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,440
It's happening a lot.

769
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:29,239
I'll be out to dinner with Kim.

770
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:30,039
And I'll just think of...

771
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,920
And then the rock getting thrown.

772
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,159
And I don't know why.

773
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:36,360
It's fucking crazy.

774
01:04:57,909 --> 01:04:58,389
Do not...

775
01:04:58,389 --> 01:04:58,949
Wait a minute.

776
01:04:58,949 --> 01:04:59,510
What's this?

777
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:00,710
We have an important message here.

778
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:02,730
Let me see what this is.

779
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:09,500
Hey everyone, fucking listen.

780
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,980
For the love of God, do not buy the $5 Biggie bag from Wendy's.

781
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:17,260
If you purchase the standard 4th floor and add bacon, it comes to $4.50.

782
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,059
They're scamming you.

783
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,019
Instead, upgrade your fries to a large and your total will be $5.

784
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:24,460
I don't even know what that means.

785
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,420
I have not been to Wendy's in probably like six months.

786
01:05:36,949 --> 01:05:37,989
I'm a McDonald's guy.

787
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:39,909
You guys know that.

788
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,960
I'm a McDonald's guy.

789
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:53,269
If I had fast food, me and Kim.

790
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:54,070
Kim is the same way.

791
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,110
Kim's a McDonald's girl.

792
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:55,989
I'm a McDonald's guy.

793
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:58,920
Number one.

794
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:00,699
I'm sorry.

795
01:06:00,699 --> 01:06:01,980
That's just the way it is.

796
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:09,909
McDonald's is dog food.

797
01:06:09,909 --> 01:06:10,469
No, it's not.

798
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:11,349
It's great.

799
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:12,949
It's good.

800
01:06:12,949 --> 01:06:14,949
McChicken is fucking perfect.

801
01:06:14,949 --> 01:06:15,989
Number one is really good.

802
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,510
McDonald's is...

803
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,469
I like McDonald's.

804
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:20,389
I think when...

805
01:06:20,389 --> 01:06:21,909
It's more comfortable for me to eat at McDonald's.

806
01:06:21,909 --> 01:06:25,269
Wendy's might be higher quality food, but I like McDonald's better.

807
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:25,670
I don't care.

808
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:28,699
I like it.

809
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:36,630
How much did they pay you?

810
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:39,510
If you really think that McDonald's needs to pay somebody

811
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,739
to talk about how they like the Big Mac.

812
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:48,500
I mean, there's like 16,000 McDonald's stores.

813
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,860
They're doing just fine.

814
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:54,039
They don't need my help.

815
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:59,179
A McDonald's hamburger is sold every tenth of a second in this country.

816
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:00,139
They don't need my help.

817
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:01,420
They don't need to pay me for that.

818
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:05,349
The people are going to eat there.

819
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:06,070
All right, what should we do?

820
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:15,639
Final judgment.

821
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:17,000
It's garbage food.

822
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,280
You're killing yourself.

823
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:27,130
Do you have you ever listened to Benjamin Franklin's podcast?

824
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,650
All things in moderation.

825
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:33,159
He would have had a great podcast, don't you think?

826
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:37,579
I think Ben Franklin would have been the Joe Rogan.

827
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:39,130
Don't you think so?

828
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:41,849
He would have like the microphone set up.

829
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:49,369
He'd be bringing in people.

830
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:51,610
Okay, let me buy something.

831
01:07:51,610 --> 01:08:00,809
I need to get this.

832
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:02,489
I feel like I'm wasting money.

833
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:04,809
Should I upgrade Gandalf?

834
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:05,309
This is...

835
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:08,340
Just do it for everybody.

836
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:08,840
X.

837
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:15,909
The dude came up with electricity.

838
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:20,010
I know what Tesla said.

839
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:23,369
Benjamin Franklin got struck by lightning first.

840
01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:24,010
And he lived.

841
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:26,550
At least that's what the cartoon told me.

842
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:35,159
I'm going to get this because this is very important for everyone to have this.

843
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:36,600
It's incredibly important.

844
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:43,699
And do I have enough?

845
01:08:43,699 --> 01:08:44,659
I have enough to give it to everybody.

846
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:45,539
Just give it to everybody.

847
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,500
I'm spreading it all around.

848
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:55,590
This looks good.

849
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:59,779
It's like a knockdown.

850
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,250
I'll do the kill.

851
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:06,060
X circle R2.

852
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:06,699
All right, that's good.

853
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:26,359
You sound like you're reading a menu at a restaurant.

854
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,880
We're picking skills?

855
01:09:31,239 --> 01:09:39,239
Now, I know exactly what I want.

856
01:09:40,739 --> 01:09:47,100
See, I pre-order at every restaurant I go to.

857
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:52,470
What that means is every restaurant has their menus online now.

858
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:54,170
I go find out what I want.

859
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:56,409
I know what I want when I get in.

860
01:09:56,409 --> 01:09:57,529
I don't have to ask any questions.

861
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:04,710
So then it's not a question of sitting there for 20 minutes

862
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,310
while I try to figure out what the hell you want to eat.

863
01:10:07,029 --> 01:10:09,050
I kind of have to watch this, don't I?

864
01:10:09,689 --> 01:10:13,430
The world is changing.

865
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:21,989
Stand against the armies of Isegard Mordor.

866
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:29,239
What I'm doing today is I've been providing the voice of Saruman in the game.

867
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:30,840
I told you the power of stone.

868
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,800
Saruman the White was the head of the Order.

869
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,239
And he thinks that he can be the Lord of the Rings.

870
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:39,560
We must join with Saruman.

871
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,800
Power of Saruman lies in his voice.

872
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,000
Absolutely legendary.

873
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,159
Now we can attend with the will of Saruman.

874
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:48,119
He's not just a wizard who can do extraordinary things.

875
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:51,399
He can convince most unlikely people.

876
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:53,479
This is the impression, you see, that he gives.

877
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:55,720
All powerful.

878
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,560
What a professional.

879
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,399
What an absolute professional.

880
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:02,600
If you do the right things, you will beat me.

881
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,159
If you do the wrong things, you will lose.

882
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,279
Is Viggo Mortensen in this game?

883
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,279
I hope so.

884
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:16,979
All right, we can go to the King of the Dead.

885
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:18,489
No, we don't.

886
01:11:18,489 --> 01:11:19,210
We have to do...

887
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:19,770
Wait, didn't we?

888
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:22,390
Yeah, we're going to go up.

889
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:23,670
Escape from Ozgaloth.

890
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,390
You know, we can do it all.

891
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,270
Whatever, we're doing it all.

892
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:37,909
That was violent for Sam.

893
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:41,590
Isn't Sam a chef?

894
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,270
Well, I guess you know how to cut stuff.

895
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:52,979
It's filled with both great hope and the success of our plan.

896
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:57,239
I must place the smallest of us in the greatest of peril.

897
01:11:57,239 --> 01:12:03,689
Always the mighty tried to possess the ring and always they failed.

898
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:14,380
Fate has lent me a hobby, resilient to the ring's corruption and brave by his very nature.

899
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,319
I want to watch these movies.

900
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:18,680
You cannot stay in the Shire.

901
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,319
No.

902
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:21,000
Elijah Wood's awesome, too.

903
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,479
This is just an all-awesome cast.

904
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:24,920
Everybody is so good.

905
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:28,010
Start hard to bear the ring.

906
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:41,460
You will need paths into Mordor.

907
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:46,520
For all three of them are bound to the fate of the ring and to the fate of each other.

908
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:48,279
All right, I'm going to...

909
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:49,479
How many people are in this community?

910
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,550
Like a few hundred thousand.

911
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:58,060
I'll rent out a football stadium and we'll just put it on a big screen

912
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,020
and everyone's invited.

913
01:12:59,020 --> 01:12:59,500
We'll do that.

914
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,010
What do you want this way?

915
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:06,739
You know the way to order.

916
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:07,859
Imagine.

917
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:15,260
Oh, that was like 40 million dollars to get the licensing to do that.

918
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,699
Into the very fires of Mordor.

919
01:13:16,699 --> 01:13:19,340
Watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a stadium.

920
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:26,760
And they'll be captured and all hope may be lost.

921
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,720
I hire a...

922
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:35,270
Like a LARPing crew to do every scene on the football field while the movie is playing.

923
01:13:35,989 --> 01:13:37,270
So you get two at the same time.

924
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:52,539
Make it happen.

925
01:13:52,539 --> 01:13:55,180
Anybody have a hundred million dollars that they don't need anymore?

926
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,699
That they'd like to just have disappear?

927
01:14:07,449 --> 01:14:09,659
All right, let's go.

928
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:14,939
All right, I'm just slashing at random people.

929
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:19,260
Are we supposed to be following you?

930
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:21,460
Can you block?

931
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:26,279
By the way, all you guys that said like minus two.

932
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:37,079
He's doing it.

933
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:39,819
That is the...

934
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:42,060
Oh, button for him.

935
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:56,010
Does he have Orcure?

936
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:58,699
Can he even have Orcure?

937
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:03,850
What is it?

938
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:04,250
It's a...

939
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:10,789
It's what?

940
01:15:10,789 --> 01:15:11,029
X...

941
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,310
He has it, right?

942
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:12,710
Doesn't he?

943
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:13,989
It's...

944
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,430
It's X circle...

945
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:18,390
X circle R2.

946
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:20,899
X circle R2?

947
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:26,949
Oh, he's level one.

948
01:15:26,949 --> 01:15:28,149
He can't do it.

949
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:28,949
Oh, all right.

950
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:35,180
Why can't we...

951
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:35,420
Okay.

952
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,640
Can we not trade swords?

953
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:41,850
Like this is just the...

954
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,130
You don't want to take it from your friend.

955
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:45,529
But if your friend has the legendary,

956
01:15:45,529 --> 01:15:48,250
don't you think you should put it in the hands of the person that knows how to attack?

957
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:51,350
It's kind of...

958
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:52,710
It's useless in your hands right now.

959
01:16:00,039 --> 01:16:00,840
It's soul bound.

960
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,319
Yeah, well, you shouldn't press need on it,

961
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:04,920
but I'm not going to give you shit for it.

962
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,319
Every time...

963
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:07,319
We can't talk about World of Warcraft

964
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:09,880
every single time we play a game with swords in it.

965
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,520
All right?

966
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,800
I'm not going to talk about it anymore.

967
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,260
I didn't even have to do anything.

968
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:28,970
How?

969
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,239
Oh, that was...

970
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:40,760
We just both hit each other at the same time.

971
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:46,600
Sam is the best character?

972
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,000
We'll see.

973
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,279
We'll see.

974
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,100
I'm not sure if I agree with that statement, but...

975
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:56,460
I mean, he did win the Academy Awards, so you're kind of right.

976
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:12,659
Actual Academy Award.

977
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,819
Dude, it was him.

978
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:15,220
You got it.

979
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:26,020
I didn't even notice the dragon.

980
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:28,579
Well, I did before, but, you know, I didn't know the dragon was still here.

981
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:29,539
Does this happen in the movie?

982
01:17:33,619 --> 01:17:34,500
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

983
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,699
Come on, let's get Sam some perfects.

984
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:36,500
I need the XP.

985
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:49,750
This was cut from the movie.

986
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:59,560
That was a cool move.

987
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:01,619
Fire it!

988
01:18:05,109 --> 01:18:06,149
He does have the orcure.

989
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:11,510
I don't like Sam...

990
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,710
I don't like Sam's orcure.

991
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:13,430
It's too fancy.

992
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:15,960
I don't like that.

993
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,000
It takes him too long to do it.

994
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:19,369
I'm not playing with him.

995
01:18:19,369 --> 01:18:19,869
I don't care.

996
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:21,710
I'm playing with Gandalf.

997
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:22,210
Fuck it.

998
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:34,329
I'm leaving?

999
01:18:35,949 --> 01:18:36,270
Really?

1000
01:18:37,149 --> 01:18:39,289
I can't even see who's shooting.

1001
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:45,159
Gandalf hits twice with his orcure.

1002
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:47,079
He spins around and swings once.

1003
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:48,239
It's not very good.

1004
01:18:57,369 --> 01:18:59,369
Why are the hobbits as tall as the orcs?

1005
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:04,430
Looks like we're going up the ladder to the cleric beast.

1006
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:06,829
I'll take that one because that's an actual good reference.

1007
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:07,869
I don't care what anybody says.

1008
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:09,710
That was a great fucking reference.

1009
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,550
One of the best I've made in probably the last few months.

1010
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:15,810
I don't care.

1011
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:30,119
You've ruined it.

1012
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:30,760
I know.

1013
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:32,680
That's the kind of...

1014
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,720
Wasn't that kind of the point?

1015
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:43,289
What?

1016
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:44,170
What just happened?

1017
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:46,840
What's the timer?

1018
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:53,529
Oh, the dragon comes back.

1019
01:19:53,529 --> 01:19:53,930
I see.

1020
01:19:54,729 --> 01:19:55,529
Okay.

1021
01:19:55,529 --> 01:20:02,090
If it was a plus two, then you acknowledged it and turned it into a minus four.

1022
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,840
Well, we'll see what the other judges have to say at the end of the boxing match.

1023
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,079
I want the help.

1024
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,590
There's always that one judge that's a real asshole.

1025
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:32,890
Aragon is getting his ass kicked.

1026
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:44,029
German, we all did minus two.

1027
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:46,699
Yeah, but you're...

1028
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,380
There's two other judges.

1029
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:51,960
My mother watches these streams.

1030
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:52,840
I'll text her later.

1031
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:55,800
What do you think about that thing I said about the Clarities?

1032
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,960
Honey, it was so good.

1033
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,920
It's always a plus two from mom, by the way.

1034
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,640
So, sorry.

1035
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:13,100
Let me get some perfects.

1036
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:17,289
Bring the bell.

1037
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:32,619
Oh, is it again?

1038
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,289
How many bells can I throw down there?

1039
01:21:35,289 --> 01:21:52,140
I have to help Aragon.

1040
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,500
Is that even Aragon or am I...

1041
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,220
Do I have this wrong?

1042
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:54,619
No, wait.

1043
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:55,500
Is that Aragon?

1044
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:55,899
Hold on.

1045
01:21:56,779 --> 01:21:58,840
Why are there two Aragons?

1046
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:18,430
You're a fake fan?

1047
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:19,789
No, this is the same person.

1048
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:29,500
That's the same character model.

1049
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:41,640
Oh, look.

1050
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,079
There's Aragon again.

1051
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:48,270
Is that just like the default like human model?

1052
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,229
It looks like Aragon.

1053
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:54,670
That's a broken back.

1054
01:22:56,329 --> 01:22:57,369
Holy shit.

1055
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:02,220
I hope you got the...

1056
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,659
I hope you land the arrow.

1057
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:11,119
All right, are we good?

1058
01:23:21,149 --> 01:23:21,949
Dragon's coming back.

1059
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:33,500
I gotta go.

1060
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,289
Where is he?

1061
01:23:35,289 --> 01:23:35,770
Oh, God.

1062
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,329
He's coming back.

1063
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:43,789
Is Frodo gonna kill the dragon?

1064
01:23:43,789 --> 01:23:56,810
You can't be up to...

1065
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:57,369
Okay, right.

1066
01:23:57,369 --> 01:23:59,930
You can't be up top when the timer reaches zero.

1067
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,840
That's not that far back, right?

1068
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:16,010
It's actually pretty far back.

1069
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:17,770
All right.

1070
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:19,369
Well, now I just get out of the way.

1071
01:24:26,939 --> 01:24:32,699
It takes you too long.

1072
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:33,420
It takes too long.

1073
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:33,899
I'm just gonna...

1074
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:35,020
I'm just gonna default swing.

1075
01:24:35,739 --> 01:24:36,560
It takes too long.

1076
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:39,520
Unless I get to perfect, which I might.

1077
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:51,579
All right, let's go.

1078
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,390
All right, he's back.

1079
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:57,710
He's back.

1080
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:58,829
I gotta get out of here.

1081
01:24:58,829 --> 01:25:00,720
We go down.

1082
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:02,699
Does this count as hiding?

1083
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:08,939
I feel like he came over here before.

1084
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,199
Right.

1085
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,079
So if I'm over here...

1086
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:16,560
So he's gone.

1087
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:16,800
Okay.

1088
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:19,369
All right.

1089
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:20,250
For the love of God.

1090
01:25:21,609 --> 01:25:23,609
Gollum, can you fucking bite somebody's leg?

1091
01:25:24,409 --> 01:25:36,939
Stab him.

1092
01:25:36,939 --> 01:25:43,100
I'm trying.

1093
01:25:43,659 --> 01:25:45,020
There's health back here though.

1094
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:45,579
All right, let's go.

1095
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,680
Not this insanity again.

1096
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,880
No, this is not gonna be insane.

1097
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:52,890
No.

1098
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:53,850
It's not gonna be insane.

1099
01:25:54,489 --> 01:25:57,960
I have confidence that I'll get...

1100
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,359
I will get...

1101
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:00,600
This will be a normal stream.

1102
01:26:03,229 --> 01:26:03,630
Normal.

1103
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:10,060
My mother's watching.

1104
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,159
This is her favorite movie ever.

1105
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:14,890
You saw the notifications.

1106
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:15,529
She texted me.

1107
01:26:15,529 --> 01:26:16,729
She's like, wait, hold on.

1108
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:17,449
The movie?

1109
01:26:18,329 --> 01:26:18,649
Yeah.

1110
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:20,090
She's like, my favorite movie?

1111
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:21,689
Yes, mom.

1112
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,739
I have to be on my best behavior.

1113
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:38,909
Yeah, you guys...

1114
01:26:38,909 --> 01:26:39,310
You too.

1115
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:45,500
You know she can read the chat.

1116
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:52,279
Is there health over here?

1117
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:55,449
Yes, there is.

1118
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,760
When's the next crack stream?

1119
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:00,750
I don't know.

1120
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:01,550
You tell me.

1121
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,949
When do you guys think you're gonna smoke your next crack?

1122
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:04,989
I don't know.

1123
01:27:04,989 --> 01:27:05,869
I can't tell you that.

1124
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:21,520
The game definitely looks better too.

1125
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:21,840
I don't know.

1126
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,479
I grabbed the cables and shook them so it worked.

1127
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:25,680
All right, we gotta go.

1128
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:27,819
Let's go.

1129
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:29,760
Forget about it.

1130
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,159
Just move.

1131
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:32,699
I can't walk that way.

1132
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:44,810
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1133
01:27:45,449 --> 01:27:45,770
Move.

1134
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:49,289
Move.

1135
01:27:50,729 --> 01:27:51,210
Well, I'm...

1136
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:54,029
Go.

1137
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:57,520
Go in, go in, go in, go in.

1138
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,380
All right, we're outside.

1139
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:04,909
Derma's dev is in chat.

1140
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:06,619
That's clever.

1141
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,699
That's pretty clever.

1142
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:14,560
Let's go.

1143
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:20,920
Three hits.

1144
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,479
Does it kill?

1145
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:26,359
Kind of.

1146
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:27,720
All right, are we safe over here?

1147
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,119
No, we're not.

1148
01:28:28,119 --> 01:28:28,439
Just go.

1149
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:29,399
Just go to the next building.

1150
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:34,380
Did you actually hit me?

1151
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,979
I was ripping back and forth.

1152
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:42,909
Wait.

1153
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:46,720
You have...

1154
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,079
Derma, you have a lot of moms.

1155
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,039
There's only one mom.

1156
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,800
And it's my mom.

1157
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:53,920
And that's it.

1158
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,180
Is there a ladder?

1159
01:28:57,739 --> 01:29:00,520
Where's the ladder?

1160
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:04,600
Anybody see a ladder?

1161
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,479
Can you say go down?

1162
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:11,930
There it is.

1163
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:12,890
You can play as Gollum.

1164
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:13,850
That'd be awesome if you could.

1165
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,800
Just keep moving.

1166
01:29:24,909 --> 01:29:25,710
Gollum gang.

1167
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:28,989
I need health.

1168
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:30,109
Otherwise...

1169
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,029
Not what a good place I want to be.

1170
01:29:32,029 --> 01:29:34,029
I don't have a checkpoint so I can't focus up.

1171
01:29:34,029 --> 01:29:35,149
I'm gonna really focus here.

1172
01:29:36,109 --> 01:29:39,529
Okay.

1173
01:29:40,329 --> 01:29:43,680
I'm master.

1174
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,640
I can do it.

1175
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,239
I'm pretty good at that one.

1176
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:58,279
It's real voice.

1177
01:30:04,729 --> 01:30:06,010
Derma, are you available?

1178
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:07,210
Of course.

1179
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:07,850
I'm available.

1180
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:24,439
Really?

1181
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:25,720
Block, block, block, block, block, block.

1182
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,359
Swing.

1183
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:29,130
Meet's back on the menu.

1184
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,060
Ooh, full health.

1185
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:36,300
Yes.

1186
01:30:36,939 --> 01:30:40,220
All right, we got a big guy coming.

1187
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:45,199
What the fuck is this?

1188
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,649
Come on, bring it on.

1189
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:52,239
How many do we have?

1190
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:54,989
Ooh, that hurt a lot.

1191
01:31:01,159 --> 01:31:02,380
All right, kill these guys first.

1192
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:07,770
Don't knock me into the fucking...

1193
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:09,449
God damn it, it happened.

1194
01:31:09,449 --> 01:31:10,489
I took them both.

1195
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:15,340
I got him in the back, I think.

1196
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:19,770
Holy shit.

1197
01:31:20,649 --> 01:31:20,970
All right.

1198
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,479
No.

1199
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:23,119
I can't even hurt him.

1200
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:28,489
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

1201
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,239
Heavy attacks.

1202
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:32,079
Why did I have to...

1203
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:33,279
I'm so fucking mad.

1204
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:35,039
Why did I have to get knocked into the two healths?

1205
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,560
It's two full...

1206
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,239
And I'm all the way back at the beginning.

1207
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:43,689
Was there a checkpoint at the bottom of the sewer?

1208
01:31:43,689 --> 01:31:48,300
Please tell me there was.

1209
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,500
Oh, fuck me.

1210
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:53,069
I'm just running.

1211
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:57,840
This course is two healths and I'm just trying to...

1212
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,960
This three guys stand...

1213
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,760
I'm just running, I don't care.

1214
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:02,079
I don't care if I get a zero.

1215
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:13,359
I have to kill like a few people.

1216
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:14,239
Fuck, why?

1217
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:16,159
This mission sucks.

1218
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,899
It's because I'm playing as Sam.

1219
01:32:20,539 --> 01:32:22,619
I could be playing as the most powerful wizard

1220
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,220
in the universe.

1221
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:27,020
But I'm going to be the guy who eats potatoes.

1222
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:57,789
Remember when Gandalf went through Osgiloth?

1223
01:32:57,789 --> 01:33:10,510
I gotta get experience points for Sam.

1224
01:33:11,149 --> 01:33:13,689
You're being a Sam hater.

1225
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,420
Well, that's okay.

1226
01:33:21,979 --> 01:33:26,560
What are my thoughts on the Hobbit movies?

1227
01:33:28,939 --> 01:33:29,979
People hate those movies.

1228
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:30,779
I thought they were fine.

1229
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:32,970
I mean, they stretched...

1230
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:38,569
They stretched a book as big as a Goosebumps book

1231
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:41,289
into three, four-hour long movies.

1232
01:33:41,289 --> 01:33:42,970
So that was probably a mistake.

1233
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:50,239
But whatever.

1234
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:52,000
I think that they're still enjoyable.

1235
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,119
I like Smog.

1236
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:55,920
I think he's good.

1237
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,960
They're a little long, a little dragged out.

1238
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,119
I could still enjoy them.

1239
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,479
Do I love them?

1240
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:04,979
No.

1241
01:34:06,039 --> 01:34:08,520
Would I choose to watch the Hobbit movies?

1242
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,159
Probably not.

1243
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:13,640
If I'm scrolling through Cable

1244
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,750
and I land on the Hobbit

1245
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:21,550
and there's 45 minutes left in the movie?

1246
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:22,989
Yeah, sure, I'll catch the end.

1247
01:34:23,710 --> 01:34:24,210
Why not?

1248
01:34:33,949 --> 01:34:34,829
Please get out of my way.

1249
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:37,529
Please get out of my fucking way.

1250
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:39,689
Don't even fucking think about it, seriously.

1251
01:34:40,569 --> 01:34:43,949
Come on, don't even think about it.

1252
01:34:43,949 --> 01:34:46,430
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

1253
01:34:47,069 --> 01:34:47,569
It's close.

1254
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:56,199
Just let it cool down.

1255
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,130
But no, I wouldn't really choose to watch the Hobbit movies.

1256
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:22,140
But I, it's not, not like I hate them.

1257
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,340
He does hate them.

1258
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:23,979
No, he doesn't.

1259
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,560
Hold on, let me get through this.

1260
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:39,340
You just knocked him back up, dude.

1261
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:43,850
I don't really, here's, okay, the thing about movies.

1262
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,800
I don't really hate movies.

1263
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:50,859
I don't really.

1264
01:35:51,739 --> 01:35:53,020
I hate video games.

1265
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,140
Like, you know what it is?

1266
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,300
Because I'm in control of the video game.

1267
01:35:56,859 --> 01:36:00,300
And I feel like I'm being personally slighted when I, as my avatar,

1268
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:01,579
can't do something I'd like to do.

1269
01:36:03,229 --> 01:36:03,470
Right?

1270
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:06,510
But a movie, I'm watching somebody else, I don't care.

1271
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:08,510
Like, if the movie sucks, whatever, I had nothing to do with it.

1272
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,760
If something bad happens to me in a game, I had something to do with it.

1273
01:36:15,399 --> 01:36:18,300
But I don't, I don't hate movies, really.

1274
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:31,739
I can not, I can think movies aren't really good, but no.

1275
01:36:31,739 --> 01:36:34,859
There is no Surge 2 for me, or Surge, no, I didn't play the Surge 2.

1276
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:35,659
There is no Surge.

1277
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,000
That's not even the worst game I think I've ever played, either.

1278
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,199
Like, why am I even saying that?

1279
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:41,159
This feels unfair.

1280
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:43,840
All right, can you stop getting on the ladder?

1281
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,760
All right, I gotta pay attention, because I'm not doing this again.

1282
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:03,689
The one time I don't swing.

1283
01:37:04,329 --> 01:37:05,130
Swing!

1284
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:06,489
You're just waiting for me to do it.

1285
01:37:12,649 --> 01:37:18,029
Okay, just, I got this two health packs up there.

1286
01:37:21,289 --> 01:37:22,810
Now I'm gonna try hard as Sam.

1287
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:23,289
Yes, I am.

1288
01:37:24,010 --> 01:37:31,289
Come on, don't.

1289
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:38,430
Okay, all right, all right, all right, easy.

1290
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:43,920
Oh my god.

1291
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,609
I just tried to do a heavy attack, and he fucking, like, destroyed me.

1292
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:56,859
Give me the health pack.

1293
01:37:56,859 --> 01:38:00,380
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1294
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,619
This is, this is a little ridiculous.

1295
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:17,319
Let's go!

1296
01:38:40,939 --> 01:38:47,159
Level up!

1297
01:38:47,159 --> 01:38:48,840
He's beginning to believe.

1298
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,340
Yes.

1299
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:53,470
This is the end of the level.

1300
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:54,109
Yeah, that sucks.

1301
01:39:04,829 --> 01:39:06,750
Have you made a reward to end the stream?

1302
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:10,189
Reward?

1303
01:39:10,189 --> 01:39:10,689
What?

1304
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:34,359
150,000 channel points to end stream?

1305
01:39:38,119 --> 01:39:49,390
No, do it.

1306
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:56,159
At a million?

1307
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:57,119
No, I don't want that.

1308
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:04,939
What if I have something big planned?

1309
01:40:04,939 --> 01:40:08,539
Hey guys, here we are on a big stream that took like a few weeks to make.

1310
01:40:08,539 --> 01:40:09,659
Oh, turn the stream off.

1311
01:40:09,659 --> 01:40:10,460
Okay, bye.

1312
01:40:11,979 --> 01:40:23,710
Turn it back on a second later.

1313
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:26,189
Do you know how much that fucks up with notifications?

1314
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:28,760
It would just be bad.

1315
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:31,640
People would just leave and then I would delete a bunch of people

1316
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:32,680
because they probably wouldn't come back

1317
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:33,880
because they already got the notification.

1318
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,479
It would screw, no, I'm never doing that.

1319
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:45,880
10,006.

1320
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:48,560
All right, what does, what does Sam get?

1321
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:49,520
I don't even want to put up.

1322
01:40:55,789 --> 01:40:56,109
Nice.

1323
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:57,949
Okay, Poison Blade.

1324
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:01,949
Yeah.

1325
01:41:01,949 --> 01:41:05,470
Increases the time that a hobbit is hidden by using his elven cloak.

1326
01:41:11,949 --> 01:41:12,750
Warrior's Bane.

1327
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:16,270
Parry, then instantly kill a man-sized enemy.

1328
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:22,989
To everyone.

1329
01:41:22,989 --> 01:41:27,630
As opposed to a child-sized of hobbit-sized enemy.

1330
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:28,270
I don't understand.

1331
01:41:39,449 --> 01:41:41,609
12,000 poison daggers.

1332
01:41:43,579 --> 01:41:44,300
Strength of iron.

1333
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,819
Permanently increases your health.

1334
01:41:45,819 --> 01:41:48,380
I'm not level five.

1335
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:49,899
Um, what do I got for all?

1336
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:53,930
Level four.

1337
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:55,609
I could get this for everybody.

1338
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:07,390
Orc Bane.

1339
01:42:09,229 --> 01:42:11,229
Or, uh, probably Orc Bane, right?

1340
01:42:11,229 --> 01:42:12,430
Get Orc Bane for everyone.

1341
01:42:13,149 --> 01:42:14,029
It's so important.

1342
01:42:15,069 --> 01:42:16,350
It's just bang, it's instant.

1343
01:42:16,909 --> 01:42:20,920
Yeah, just get it for everyone.

1344
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:22,279
You know what?

1345
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:23,000
I got some points.

1346
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,039
Let's do, um, people are going to be pissed off

1347
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:28,199
if I don't buy at least one thing for Sam.

1348
01:42:28,199 --> 01:42:30,779
Uh, we'll do, we'll do the cloak.

1349
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:34,539
Let's see, all the L1, R1, L2, okay.

1350
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:44,600
An Orc Bane impression.

1351
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,159
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1352
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:53,039
Nah, nah, I don't think so.

1353
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:53,680
I don't think so.

1354
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:58,720
It's not, I don't think that's gonna happen.

1355
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:08,350
Escape from Osgiloth.

1356
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:10,029
All right, now we're in the main story here.

1357
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:12,750
But we do have Sam.

1358
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,670
Oh, we have a Sean Astin interview.

1359
01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:15,310
Let's check it out.

1360
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:17,850
Mordor.

1361
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:21,100
The one place in Middle Earth we don't want to see any closer.

1362
01:43:21,899 --> 01:43:23,420
The one place we're trying to get to.

1363
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:25,659
It's just where we can't get.

1364
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,739
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo.

1365
01:43:29,739 --> 01:43:30,300
We're lost.

1366
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:34,989
There's a lot in the movie where Sam is, the character himself, is very-

1367
01:43:34,989 --> 01:43:35,710
He's American?

1368
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:38,109
He gets sad a lot.

1369
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:40,109
He's, there's a kind of comic relief element.

1370
01:43:40,909 --> 01:43:41,789
Holy shit.

1371
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:46,329
His goodness and his decency is what makes him heroic

1372
01:43:46,329 --> 01:43:48,810
and his, his bravery in the face of great danger.

1373
01:43:49,289 --> 01:43:50,810
I'm going to Mordor alone.

1374
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:51,529
Of course you are.

1375
01:43:51,529 --> 01:43:52,329
Bro, spoilers.

1376
01:43:52,329 --> 01:43:54,090
And I'm coming with you.

1377
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:56,569
But because the game is sort of an action war game,

1378
01:43:56,569 --> 01:43:59,930
the aspect of Sam's character that really comes through in the game

1379
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:02,170
is the kind of heroic, heroic character.

1380
01:44:02,489 --> 01:44:03,130
Fighting Sam.

1381
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:07,979
I get to really go and fight the orcs instead of having to, you know,

1382
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:11,340
pull up from stabbing them because it's a stunt guy you don't want to hurt.

1383
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,899
You really feel like you're inside the movie, driving the movie.

1384
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:19,100
When I actually, for the first time, had a controller in my hands,

1385
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:22,460
I was looking at a very realistic likeness of myself.

1386
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:23,659
That's gotta be so crazy.

1387
01:44:23,659 --> 01:44:25,420
And it reminded me of filming the scenes.

1388
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,340
It looked exactly like when we were filming on the sets

1389
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:28,939
and it was totally interactive.

1390
01:44:28,939 --> 01:44:29,659
I think the game is-

1391
01:44:29,659 --> 01:44:31,420
You really feel like Sam, yeah.

1392
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:37,199
That's good.

1393
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:39,449
All right, let's do The King of the Dead.

1394
01:44:40,409 --> 01:44:51,310
I can't fucking believe I'm doing what I did last time.

1395
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:53,390
We're going to get to a level where I'm stuck for like two hours.

1396
01:44:53,949 --> 01:44:57,369
And it was because I didn't pick Aragorn in the first level.

1397
01:45:17,069 --> 01:45:20,619
Boss?

1398
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:23,279
Boss fight.

1399
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:28,140
Wait, wasn't he just talking to Aragorn?

1400
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:43,550
Ooh, I almost had perfect there.

1401
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:48,779
Gimli sucks.

1402
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:50,140
Oh, he doesn't.

1403
01:45:50,779 --> 01:45:53,720
It's just a little small.

1404
01:45:54,520 --> 01:46:10,760
All right, let's go.

1405
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,239
Bring it on.

1406
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,079
I need to get some perfects here.

1407
01:46:15,079 --> 01:46:15,399
What?

1408
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:23,840
Come on, here it comes.

1409
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,159
Perfect.

1410
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:26,939
Come on, do it.

1411
01:46:28,489 --> 01:46:28,890
Do it!

1412
01:46:40,909 --> 01:46:41,789
Is there health anywhere?

1413
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:51,850
Uh-oh.

1414
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:54,159
I see what you're doing over there.

1415
01:47:07,689 --> 01:47:09,210
Why are you throwing it, Gimli?

1416
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:10,649
I don't even see where that was.

1417
01:47:16,539 --> 01:47:16,779
Just-

1418
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,289
He does that every time.

1419
01:47:21,289 --> 01:47:22,170
I'm going to have to fight him again.

1420
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:30,189
Perfect!

1421
01:47:30,189 --> 01:47:42,859
You wasted my perfect meter, dude.

1422
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:52,039
Oh, he's going to do it again.

1423
01:47:52,039 --> 01:47:52,359
I see.

1424
01:47:53,869 --> 01:47:56,989
Uh-oh, it's like Space Invaders.

1425
01:47:57,550 --> 01:47:58,970
He's already-

1426
01:48:03,399 --> 01:48:04,119
Oh, shit.

1427
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:10,760
Dude, how many spikes do you get?

1428
01:48:11,479 --> 01:48:15,260
Dang!

1429
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:22,760
Is he going to do it?

1430
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:23,399
He's going to do the-

1431
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:24,460
Oh.

1432
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:28,479
No health.

1433
01:48:28,479 --> 01:48:29,119
I'm in trouble.

1434
01:48:33,369 --> 01:48:46,380
God, I'm so paranoid.

1435
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:52,250
Health, got it.

1436
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:52,970
Nice.

1437
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:58,619
All right, let's go.

1438
01:48:58,619 --> 01:48:59,260
Bring it on.

1439
01:48:59,260 --> 01:48:59,979
Bring it on.

1440
01:48:59,979 --> 01:49:00,380
Bring it on.

1441
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:01,579
New commentary for the day.

1442
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:03,739
I fucking forgot again.

1443
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:24,649
What's he doing?

1444
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:29,149
Just another wave.

1445
01:49:29,949 --> 01:49:33,149
Oh, shit.

1446
01:49:33,149 --> 01:49:34,029
And there's archers.

1447
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:47,119
Hey, he was off screen.

1448
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:47,600
That's not fair.

1449
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:56,010
How do you-

1450
01:49:56,729 --> 01:49:58,970
How do you do, fellow warriors?

1451
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:00,090
That doesn't work here.

1452
01:50:01,369 --> 01:50:03,180
That was so stupid.

1453
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:04,300
Why do they even read that?

1454
01:50:06,859 --> 01:50:08,539
You do, fellow warriors.

1455
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:14,600
All right, I win.

1456
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:19,760
This is it.

1457
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:20,560
Don't go right in.

1458
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:21,930
He does the-

1459
01:50:22,649 --> 01:50:23,770
Here we go.

1460
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:34,460
I win.

1461
01:50:42,939 --> 01:50:46,140
What say you?

1462
01:50:47,949 --> 01:50:50,270
I need you to come off the boat

1463
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:51,390
and be in the movie

1464
01:50:51,390 --> 01:50:52,989
for 10 seconds in a battle.

1465
01:50:52,989 --> 01:50:53,710
What say you?

1466
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:15,369
Oh, Jesus.

1467
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:20,859
No, I'm slow.

1468
01:51:24,359 --> 01:51:25,319
All right, if this is me,

1469
01:51:26,199 --> 01:51:28,760
I have at least 10 or 15 axes

1470
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,520
that I have made for me.

1471
01:51:31,159 --> 01:51:32,520
I am baseball swinging

1472
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,560
and throwing the axe off

1473
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:34,520
and running with both hands.

1474
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:36,600
I got extra axes.

1475
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:37,000
You know what I mean?

1476
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,359
Make sure you have at least

1477
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:39,159
10 of these that are made.

1478
01:51:49,149 --> 01:51:56,649
I can't see shit.

1479
01:51:57,369 --> 01:51:58,989
Let me know where I am.

1480
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:06,409
Jesus.

1481
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,399
What the fuck?

1482
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:21,069
This is fucking idiot over here

1483
01:52:21,069 --> 01:52:22,189
that's messing the whole thing up.

1484
01:52:35,229 --> 01:52:35,869
Who's winning?

1485
01:52:37,949 --> 01:52:38,829
That's a good question.

1486
01:52:39,869 --> 01:52:41,710
I think I am currently.

1487
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:47,390
We'll see in about 10 seconds

1488
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:48,270
if that's going to be the case.

1489
01:52:52,810 --> 01:53:00,960
Dude, Jeremy, it's your mother.

1490
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,640
Please stop saying the F word so often.

1491
01:53:04,189 --> 01:53:05,069
My, I learned it from you.

1492
01:53:05,789 --> 01:53:24,859
Okay, this is fun, I guess.

1493
01:53:34,409 --> 01:53:35,770
Get the fuck out of my way.

1494
01:53:56,939 --> 01:53:57,180
Go!

1495
01:53:57,739 --> 01:54:02,220
Wink now.

1496
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:16,039
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1497
01:54:17,739 --> 01:54:18,699
No, this level sucks.

1498
01:54:18,699 --> 01:54:19,500
I don't want to do this level again.

1499
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,060
I'm going to try to get through.

1500
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:21,100
No, no winks, not now.

1501
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:31,449
No, no, no, no, no.

1502
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:35,630
Four winks, you'll get it.

1503
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:36,029
No, no.

1504
01:54:36,590 --> 01:55:02,430
I can't fucking see anything.

1505
01:55:03,550 --> 01:55:08,409
Give me perfect.

1506
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:13,600
How the fuck do I not have perfect?

1507
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:20,890
Right at the fucking end.

1508
01:55:20,890 --> 01:55:21,529
Give me a break.

1509
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:53,399
Wait, is this even more of this shit?

1510
01:55:54,279 --> 01:56:02,359
I'm surprised I did that.

1511
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:09,130
Six winks.

1512
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:10,090
What?

1513
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:24,010
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1514
01:56:31,609 --> 01:56:43,079
That's a triple perk.

1515
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:44,039
The purple.

1516
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:44,600
What?

1517
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:45,079
Purple?

1518
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:47,399
Why can't I say this?

1519
01:56:47,399 --> 01:56:47,880
Purple.

1520
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:49,079
Perfect.

1521
01:56:53,819 --> 01:56:54,460
What happened?

1522
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:54,699
What?

1523
01:56:55,420 --> 01:57:03,260
I thought, what do you mean?

1524
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:04,380
I ran the wrong way.

1525
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:05,340
What the hell?

1526
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,710
What the fuck was that?

1527
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:10,430
All right, Jesus.

1528
01:57:11,149 --> 01:57:21,439
What the fuck was that?

1529
01:57:22,239 --> 01:57:23,600
I mean, I ran the wrong way.

1530
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:28,220
Oh, come on.

1531
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:29,579
Don't have to do this whole thing again, do I?

1532
01:57:30,939 --> 01:57:31,979
Oh, give me a break.

1533
01:57:34,729 --> 01:57:35,770
What the fuck?

1534
01:57:35,770 --> 01:57:37,050
That was playing pretty well, too.

1535
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:39,689
How did I run the wrong way?

1536
01:57:40,729 --> 01:57:52,829
You missed a wink.

1537
01:57:53,550 --> 01:58:00,880
You ran into the wall instead of the door.

1538
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,079
No, fuck that.

1539
01:58:02,079 --> 01:58:02,560
Come on.

1540
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:03,279
Give me a break.

1541
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,199
Winks are worthless now.

1542
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:18,510
That was hard, too.

1543
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:35,609
Not a bad start.

1544
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:40,250
Except this stupid motherfucker in the back with the dumb bow and arrow.

1545
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:41,770
I hate arrows.

1546
01:58:42,729 --> 01:58:45,930
It's so hard to see anything in this fucking game.

1547
01:58:45,930 --> 01:58:47,609
Let alone the guy shooting the arrows.

1548
01:58:48,409 --> 01:58:54,640
Missed another wink.

1549
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:55,119
No, I didn't.

1550
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:55,920
I did two extras.

1551
01:58:57,319 --> 01:59:00,359
I did two extra winks, so I'm covered for those two that I missed.

1552
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:14,670
Damn it.

1553
01:59:14,670 --> 01:59:15,710
I don't want to do this again.

1554
01:59:15,710 --> 01:59:17,149
This mission is so dumb.

1555
01:59:18,029 --> 01:59:19,310
This doesn't even happen in the movie.

1556
01:59:20,029 --> 01:59:20,670
There's a cut.

1557
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:23,149
It cuts to them being outside.

1558
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:44,090
Get out of my fucking way.

1559
01:59:44,090 --> 01:59:44,970
Come on, give me.

1560
01:59:45,609 --> 01:59:52,539
I'm not even fucking...

1561
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:58,250
Why wouldn't you put the camera like even 30 degrees higher than this?

1562
02:00:01,850 --> 02:00:04,569
All I see is green smoke.

1563
02:00:04,569 --> 02:00:27,819
Does anyone else taste iron?

1564
02:00:27,819 --> 02:00:28,380
That's blood.

1565
02:00:28,939 --> 02:00:30,300
You're tasting blood.

1566
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:38,750
I don't know why you're tasting blood, but I would maybe figure it out.

1567
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:40,189
Maybe you bit your tongue or something.

1568
02:00:40,189 --> 02:00:41,149
Just be careful.

1569
02:00:41,149 --> 02:00:51,130
All right, this time I'm not going to fuck it up.

1570
02:00:51,130 --> 02:00:51,529
Let's go.

1571
02:00:52,409 --> 02:01:05,880
I beat this game again and again when I was eight.

1572
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:06,359
No, you didn't.

1573
02:01:12,539 --> 02:01:14,220
What the fuck is going on?

1574
02:01:15,579 --> 02:01:16,079
Why?

1575
02:01:17,579 --> 02:01:18,619
Come on.

1576
02:01:18,619 --> 02:01:19,579
Fuck this level.

1577
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:21,100
Too slow.

1578
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:21,659
I was...

1579
02:01:21,659 --> 02:01:22,699
I'm walking down.

1580
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,460
That's not the wrong way.

1581
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:33,479
I'm literally walking down.

1582
02:01:43,439 --> 02:01:44,880
What the fuck?

1583
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,569
What did I do wrong?

1584
02:01:46,569 --> 02:01:46,970
I didn't do...

1585
02:01:46,970 --> 02:01:47,930
I just was walking.

1586
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:58,890
Oh, that was stupid.

1587
02:02:10,109 --> 02:02:12,189
You know, these legs are too short.

1588
02:02:12,189 --> 02:02:13,710
That's probably like whatever.

1589
02:02:14,670 --> 02:02:15,869
Did I fuck it up again?

1590
02:02:17,069 --> 02:02:41,689
I mean, he's perfect.

1591
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:53,659
Okay, can we please keep going?

1592
02:02:54,300 --> 02:03:03,439
It's happening again.

1593
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:04,159
Oh, no.

1594
02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:04,800
Oh, God.

1595
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:05,600
It's happening again.

1596
02:03:08,359 --> 02:03:08,600
What?

1597
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:12,119
The Jeremy runs into terrible game design choices?

1598
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:13,399
The stream?

1599
02:03:14,199 --> 02:03:15,239
Is that what you're describing?

1600
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:32,640
Blame the player not...

1601
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:33,199
No, no, no.

1602
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:33,920
Blame game.

1603
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:34,720
Only blame game.

1604
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:37,180
It's never my fault.

1605
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:38,380
Only blame video game.

1606
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:15,609
Call Peter Jackson right now.

1607
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:17,050
I don't have...

1608
02:04:17,050 --> 02:04:19,130
I don't know what Peter Jackson's fucking telephone number is

1609
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:20,489
and he had nothing to do with this game.

1610
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:53,000
We're good.

1611
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:53,319
We're good.

1612
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:53,640
We're good.

1613
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:53,880
We're good.

1614
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:54,199
We're good.

1615
02:04:54,199 --> 02:04:54,279
We're good.

1616
02:04:54,279 --> 02:04:55,079
We're good.

1617
02:04:55,079 --> 02:04:56,119
We're good.

1618
02:04:56,119 --> 02:05:00,720
Nice frames.

1619
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:02,479
They're actually not even as bad as you're saying.

1620
02:05:03,039 --> 02:05:04,399
They're only like 10 frames.

1621
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:05,119
Sorry.

1622
02:05:05,119 --> 02:05:20,489
I'm just gonna just bam square because of what...

1623
02:05:20,489 --> 02:05:22,010
I'm just gonna get perfects by doing this

1624
02:05:22,010 --> 02:05:22,970
because there's so many people here.

1625
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:26,779
And...

1626
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,439
I can't even.

1627
02:05:42,439 --> 02:05:43,960
I guess I hit somebody with an axe.

1628
02:05:44,680 --> 02:06:02,970
Is that...

1629
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:13,960
I guess...

1630
02:06:35,199 --> 02:06:39,279
Three come out.

1631
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:39,600
And then I...

1632
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:40,000
Okay.

1633
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:40,640
Where's the right...

1634
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,199
Where did I go?

1635
02:06:41,199 --> 02:06:42,000
Where's the right way?

1636
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:45,159
Look at this.

1637
02:06:45,159 --> 02:06:46,039
Doesn't this break away?

1638
02:06:46,039 --> 02:06:47,239
This looks like it breaks away

1639
02:06:47,239 --> 02:06:48,119
but it's not this way.

1640
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:50,109
This is down here.

1641
02:06:50,829 --> 02:06:52,729
I gotta get this right for when I need to leave.

1642
02:06:58,119 --> 02:06:58,680
Down here.

1643
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:01,710
Left?

1644
02:07:03,229 --> 02:07:04,430
Like the way that I came in?

1645
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:07,239
Like over here.

1646
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:13,229
Your other left.

1647
02:07:13,229 --> 02:07:13,869
That is left.

1648
02:07:14,430 --> 02:07:18,079
So this way.

1649
02:07:18,079 --> 02:07:30,350
What are we doing?

1650
02:07:31,069 --> 02:07:32,640
All right.

1651
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:33,199
Let's go.

1652
02:07:33,199 --> 02:07:33,840
I don't want to be...

1653
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:37,149
More...

1654
02:07:37,149 --> 02:07:38,350
What's going on?

1655
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:39,069
What's happening?

1656
02:07:39,949 --> 02:07:41,390
What is going on?

1657
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:41,710
What?

1658
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:48,810
What the...

1659
02:07:48,810 --> 02:07:53,319
The art that took too long?

1660
02:07:54,039 --> 02:07:55,100
I...

1661
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:58,039
That was the last art...

1662
02:07:58,039 --> 02:07:59,560
Why are they even spawning?

1663
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:00,279
What the...

1664
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:01,319
Give me a break.

1665
02:08:02,119 --> 02:08:03,800
Oh, I'm actually mad about this.

1666
02:08:08,119 --> 02:08:09,789
What the fuck, man?

1667
02:08:10,670 --> 02:08:19,819
They're spawning the archer over on the right

1668
02:08:19,819 --> 02:08:21,420
where the camera don't even fucking look.

1669
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:25,069
Does that...

1670
02:08:25,069 --> 02:08:25,310
What...

1671
02:08:26,189 --> 02:08:26,510
I can't...

1672
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:27,630
What am I gonna complain about?

1673
02:08:27,630 --> 02:08:29,310
A 20-year-old game that...

1674
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:29,869
Who cares?

1675
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:36,109
Oh, sorry.

1676
02:08:36,109 --> 02:08:37,789
17-year-old game.

1677
02:08:37,789 --> 02:08:43,479
I have to pee too.

1678
02:08:44,199 --> 02:08:46,010
Can I skip this mission?

1679
02:08:46,569 --> 02:09:07,069
Give me some perfects.

1680
02:09:07,789 --> 02:09:17,840
I liked it better when Christopher Lee was talking.

1681
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:19,359
That was interesting.

1682
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:24,170
I can't even get that help.

1683
02:09:31,079 --> 02:09:32,600
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1684
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:47,550
They always have to do stuff with this bullshit.

1685
02:09:47,550 --> 02:09:47,949
All right.

1686
02:09:47,949 --> 02:09:48,989
I'm gonna beat this one.

1687
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:50,750
I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

1688
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:54,670
Is it too early to be malding?

1689
02:09:55,470 --> 02:09:57,630
I hate timed missions, no matter what it is.

1690
02:09:57,630 --> 02:10:00,029
I hate scrolling Mario levels for the same damn reason.

1691
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:02,350
Guys, don't put pressure on me.

1692
02:10:02,350 --> 02:10:02,829
Fuck off.

1693
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:04,829
I want to play the game.

1694
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:35,640
Lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock,

1695
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:37,319
lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock.

1696
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:41,579
I'm gonna die.

1697
02:10:42,779 --> 02:10:47,199
I'm gonna die in here.

1698
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,449
If I die again, I have to go pee.

1699
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:01,399
Pee your pants.

1700
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:02,840
No, no, no.

1701
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:03,479
Don't tell me to do that.

1702
02:11:03,479 --> 02:11:04,199
That's not a good idea.

1703
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:27,100
What the fuck am I walking into right now?

1704
02:11:29,399 --> 02:11:31,560
There's nothing in that water, man.

1705
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:33,000
There's nothing in that water.

1706
02:11:34,430 --> 02:11:34,829
All right.

1707
02:11:34,829 --> 02:11:35,310

1710
02:11:38,439 --> 02:11:39,159

02:59:36,250 --> 02:59:56,329
what i gotta fucking clear this out oh god what's this making me look up a random fucking tower

1900
02:59:56,329 --> 03:00:29,579
that means nothing and by the way the cameras are going to change angles 15 times ladder levels

1901
03:00:29,579 --> 03:00:38,000
not another ladder level and we let's go all right i'm ready destroy the siege tower i try i try to

1902
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:45,500
just do it but we have cinematic towers to climb and another timed ass mission in this timed ass

1903
03:00:45,500 --> 03:00:59,180
game god damn it i can't fucking believe i have to do this again we already did this in the last

1904
03:00:59,260 --> 03:01:04,540
game this doesn't even happen in return of the king they just wanted to redo it because it was

1905
03:01:04,540 --> 03:01:45,159
easy to put it as its own level lord of the ladders god damn it man fucking even is anybody

1906
03:01:45,799 --> 03:02:07,549
get your shit out of here all right i'm gonna call that there's something wrong with your

1907
03:02:07,549 --> 03:02:14,760
fucking gauge there's nobody here why would that be at like 50 filled there's only one ladder

1908
03:02:28,030 --> 03:02:30,670
go all the way over here all right and then i gotta remember where the

1909
03:02:31,549 --> 03:02:36,569
catapulted nothing over here right no

1910
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:51,319
dude this this this these camera changes make me want to throw up into my hands and use it to

1911
03:02:51,319 --> 03:03:12,700
wash my face it's seriously the most disorienting fucking thing ever what the fuck this is on the

1912
03:03:12,700 --> 03:03:30,379
same plane we've changed directions like four times you have a two link debt that's all right

1913
03:03:30,379 --> 03:03:47,930
i'll settle it up later two links in the sink god damn i don't want to do another ladder level

1914
03:03:48,649 --> 03:03:59,790
nobody wants to do a ladder push level here we go and there's already a bunch of people

1915
03:03:59,790 --> 03:04:08,170
up here and i have to shoot it twice fuck oh man oh man here we go here we go again

1916
03:04:10,329 --> 03:04:22,840
uh we're gonna go up here and we're gonna get this over with you can't why can't you just fire

1917
03:04:22,840 --> 03:04:29,149
without me i need to tell you when to fire just fire you're in the right spot why do you need

1918
03:04:29,149 --> 03:05:09,049
someone to tell you to do it just do it clean up some of this shit fucking flashbacks and now

1919
03:05:09,610 --> 03:05:32,329
i'm already overwhelmed i have to fire them i'm gonna lose hey idiots the what do you what are

1920
03:05:32,329 --> 03:05:37,049
you aiming at why is this not turning the other direction what why is it not firing in the

1921
03:05:37,610 --> 03:05:47,149
direction why would it not be firing into the right side no i'm very confused they only want

1922
03:05:47,149 --> 03:06:02,959
to shoot at the one coming in on the left side what the fuck is that they won't rotate it what

1923
03:06:02,959 --> 03:06:07,280
to shoot the tower yourself well what that what in the name of god is the reason to use the

1924
03:06:07,280 --> 03:06:39,159
catapult in the first place oh my god there's no nothing there's no reason to okay here we go

1925
03:06:39,159 --> 03:07:02,829
i'm gonna i'm just gonna ignore it somebody said that uh 80 percent well you know you could say

1926
03:07:02,909 --> 03:07:08,670
that that's that's accurate i don't think it's not 80 a significant portion of my 2020 streams have

1927
03:07:08,670 --> 03:07:14,190
been running around pushing ladders down that's true now how many hours have i streamed in 2020

1928
03:07:14,190 --> 03:07:20,350
anybody know do we have any do we have that data because at least six of those hours or so have

1929
03:07:20,350 --> 03:07:25,850
been pushing ladders down in the middle of the ring stage i mean it's got to be like probably

1930
03:07:25,850 --> 03:07:58,590
five percent six percent what the fuck hit me all right let's get that to 12 percent all right all

1931
03:07:58,590 --> 03:08:10,090
right i'm gonna stop reading chat and play the game you know what go down here it's probably

1932
03:08:10,090 --> 03:08:26,079
easier for me to hit these just go all the way around right that's the scrap anytime there's any

1933
03:08:26,079 --> 03:09:03,069
more than one in the middle where is this where's this thing tiny ass ladder die

1971
03:18:52,520 --> 03:18:58,319

1972
03:18:58,319 --> 03:19:31,899
camera so you got what you wanted now what we have now there's another wink 20 minutes no that wasn't

1973
03:19:34,680 --> 03:19:38,920
at the top of the wall he and oh he and mckellan

1974
03:19:55,069 --> 03:20:00,239
quarters in england of ea was me doing the crack what the fuck is this

1975
03:20:00,479 --> 03:20:09,340
game which the curiosity of gandalf that there are many of us this is me but then when we were

1976
03:20:09,340 --> 03:20:14,780
making the film there was my double and there was the stunt gandalfs the ones who did the fights and

1977
03:20:14,780 --> 03:20:20,700
their twelves and then there's the digitalized gandalfs who are sometimes seen in the crowd scenes

1978
03:20:20,700 --> 03:20:26,700
in the film then there's the gandalf of this um this guy the gandalf is seven thousand years

1979
03:20:26,700 --> 03:20:32,780
old but he can do the most remarkable things and he's still got that's a long time and i only wish

1980
03:20:32,780 --> 03:20:43,049
that gandalf in the film had been quite as agile as gandalf the wisest of you will choose to imagine

1981
03:20:43,049 --> 03:20:55,469
being alive maybe the most of that long immortal character or something immortal if you can't be

1982
03:20:55,469 --> 03:20:59,229
in the movie you might as well play the game it's the next best thing i've been alive and being able

1983
03:20:59,229 --> 03:21:05,870
to see the dinosaurs become extinct it's too much info to have all right let's go on the other

1984
03:21:05,950 --> 03:21:13,790
let's go back to our to our hobbit crew seven thousand no i know seven thousand years is not

1985
03:21:13,790 --> 03:21:18,879
seven million i'm just saying if you if you were immortal you would just watch whole civil no i

1986
03:21:18,879 --> 03:21:23,690
wouldn't want to do that a thousand years would be fun though like you'd be able to live a thousand

1987
03:21:23,690 --> 03:21:46,780
years that's kind of interesting i would not i wouldn't want to live forever golem's treachery

1988
03:21:46,780 --> 03:21:57,639
may yet be the ruin of our plan but only guide frodo to his doom really won't live forever

1989
03:21:58,600 --> 03:22:09,870
we're trapped i'm pretzels dreamer you look like golem you look like golem he has actually

1990
03:22:09,870 --> 03:22:21,280
has your facial features you kind of look like him yeah i know that's funny okay some ways

1991
03:22:21,280 --> 03:22:40,079
mr frodo was counting on you to rescue him no matter what this is a maze level what i can't

1992

03:34:29,319 --> 03:34:34,670
for this chat here what's the best lord of the rings movie which one that's not what i wanted

2030
03:34:34,670 --> 03:34:50,680
to do really fellowship fellowship is pretty good it's probably two towers for me yeah it's

2031
03:34:50,680 --> 03:34:54,489
two towers for me the turn of the king is really good but it's it's two towers i think

2032
03:34:55,290 --> 03:35:15,020
at least for me shit there's so many here it's the best trilogy ever made oh absolutely

2033
03:35:17,709 --> 03:35:26,430
i don't think anything comes close what comes close what's the trilogy that comes

2034
03:35:27,069 --> 03:35:46,889
is it too late oh well shit here we go i have to pick them up all right what's the strategy here

2036
03:35:57,420 --> 03:36:14,250
swing maybe not i don't think that's what i have to do okay what what happens in the movie doesn't

2103
03:59:17,739 --> 03:59:26,090
out the streamer that winks every like three minutes on stream yeah that's right i might

2104
03:59:26,090 --> 03:59:51,559
have to put the can on this one in like six months before i already got a buff so he can do a parry

2105
03:59:51,559 --> 04:00:01,959
now and he can do this combo finally it only took a million what the fuck happening right now

2106
04:00:08,379 --> 04:00:23,469
are you finished yes i am well not i mean strange still going but you know all right we're at the

2107
04:00:23,469 --> 04:00:38,319
final three levels of the game i i can't believe there's still more coming in the final four levels

2108
04:00:38,319 --> 04:01:00,600
see oh hold on elijah wood let's see what elijah has to say one ring never gets to join in any

2109
04:01:00,600 --> 04:01:05,159
battles in the film so i was always the kind of the one that was really weak and burdened by the

2110
04:01:05,159 --> 04:01:09,719
ring and in this i get to take photo on some adventures that he didn't actually get to go on

2111
04:01:10,760 --> 04:01:17,870
i'm a playable character that's cool yes photo style combat's kind of a little clunkier it's

2112
04:01:17,870 --> 04:01:25,389
not it's not as finessed as aragorn or certainly legolas would be potatoes kind of fighting very

2113
04:01:25,389 --> 04:01:29,549
straightforward i thought that was him falling down the stairs for a second to sort of be able

2114
04:01:29,549 --> 04:01:34,989
to take my character from the film and to be able to kind of implement that into the game is is

2115
04:01:34,989 --> 04:01:39,149
pretty awesome i shall take up this terrible task choosing photo you're also choosing the

2116
04:01:39,149 --> 04:01:51,180
ring bear so that's pretty cool i'm kind of biased nice all right here's kyrith kyrith tingle

2117
04:01:52,569 --> 04:02:00,280

2184
04:21:29,610 --> 04:21:40,110
that's why it happens to midstream stop it that's what we do usually i typically don't stop until

2185
04:21:40,110 --> 04:21:44,430
you know in the middle of the stream to do uh hits or subs or anything unless it's like something

2490
05:45:41,979 --> 05:45:58,729
got like he's he's like the comic relief and he's back how is golem comedy relief let me like say

2495
05:46:51,819 --> 05:47:26,700
as i compared golem to jar jar binks apologize two relationships ruined today but is it golem or

2496
05:47:26,700 --> 05:47:42,169
golem not this time golem it's golem right all right oh off edge what was wrong with that

get over here fall down okay you can fall now there you go last one bye do you let it go

2506
05:50:20,720 --> 05:50:39,229
that really wasn't that bad this is annoying the ring is destroyed and all that was done by that

2507
05:50:39,229 --> 05:50:46,110
power is passing away they do it those who were banned to the fate of the one are now free real

2508
05:50:46,110 --> 05:50:53,310
crowded now come the days of the king may they be blessed while the thrones of the valor endure

2509
05:50:58,080 --> 05:51:05,500
so do you think they're ever gonna do like the ring awakens do another trilogy after

2510
05:51:10,110 --> 05:51:23,450
secret fire of honor saron in his greed as saron mingled his own blood with the ring's gold so

2511
05:51:23,450 --> 05:51:44,810
did i mingle myself with my magic to live here i wove but a spell of trust and fellowship given

2512
05:51:44,810 --> 05:51:53,150
free but why was that yeah why is that in here it's finished that doesn't even happen in this

2513
05:51:53,150 --> 05:52:02,189
work of others we actually did just watch we watched all the lord of the rings on screen

2514
05:52:02,830 --> 05:52:05,740
we actually got to do it oh

2515
05:52:05,740 --> 05:52:08,139
oh

2516
05:52:08,700 --> 05:52:16,409
that's why they did that it was a it was a shout out for the dvd

2517
05:52:27,740 --> 05:52:41,130
three so i'm assuming you can build up how would you build up your perfect meter and then do the

2518
05:52:41,130 --> 05:52:44,169
last hit on him is that how you supposed to do that that would probably a huge pain in the ass

2519
05:52:50,680 --> 05:53:11,340
well let's uh go on a spending spree now i need to level 10 anybody level 10 what's the percentage

2520
05:53:14,040 --> 05:53:26,860
80% of what's gonna be like 85 86 who would win in a fight 1v1 golem versus jar jar

2521
05:53:28,700 --> 05:53:38,490
it jar jar it would absolutely be jar jar it would not be going it wouldn't be going

2522
05:53:39,709 --> 05:53:44,349

2533
05:56:45,720 --> 05:56:58,779

2535
05:57:14,810 --> 05:57:33,560
i thought it was gonna be way cooler than that but whatever stop what you all right you is that

2536
05:57:33,560 --> 05:57:44,540
really all it takes to do to get away from gandalf float backwards of two steps that's right prime was

2537
05:57:46,520 --> 05:57:52,669
i mean the 2000s the early 2000s like from 2000 to 2010 i mean do you talk i don't think there'll

2538
05:57:52,669 --> 05:58:01,709
be that rivals somewhere in the mid 90s the heyday of the super nintendo and sega genesis there was

2539
05:58:01,709 --> 05:58:09,279
some unbeatable games and then 64 think about the shit that came out in n64 oh man think about

2540
05:58:09,279 --> 05:58:17,020
the shit that came out of super nintendo in like 94 95 96 what a great what a great like

2541
05:58:17,740 --> 05:58:29,930
i was gonna say season he actually thinks the n64 is good um i mean super mario 64 and like

2542
05:58:30,729 --> 05:58:42,720
zelda games and we've got to be kidding 1064 i'm just talking about banjo kazooie yeah i think i

2543
05:58:42,720 --> 05:58:55,979
think you guys are messing around yeah you have to be what's banjo kazooie um i mean i don't

2544
05:58:55,979 --> 05:59:03,159
need should i even respond to that i feel like that's just somebody making a joke uh banjo kazooie

2545
05:59:03,159 --> 05:59:07,240
no i'm not responding so um i'm gonna lose here because i'm not paying attention anymore

2546
05:59:08,200 --> 05:59:14,939
i banned that person but not knowing what banjo kazooie is that's petty but go ahead and do it

2547
05:59:15,659 --> 05:59:37,130
come on one more get to seven shoot the giant egg that is it for me not even close to as hard

2548
05:59:37,130 --> 05:59:43,849
as two towers i played in the same difficulty too there's normal although i did get really

2549
05:59:43,849 --> 06:00:02,490
really really lucky at the very end of the um at elephant level easy can i get to 10 it's really

2550
06:00:02,490 --> 06:00:08,919
not even that bad it's actually kind of fun but i'm not gonna do it elephant level is the hardest

2551
06:00:08,919 --> 06:00:16,590
one yeah i got really lucky i i had one health pixel off from losing i'm doing the whole damn

2552
06:00:16,590 --> 06:00:32,939
thing again i'm running away that's cheap all right well that uh that you that has been you've now

2553
06:00:32,939 --> 06:00:51,979
seen all the lord of the rings trilogy on this stream thanks for watching did i unlock something

2554
06:00:51,979 --> 06:00:57,520
else what's going on oh i wanted to i want to watch the uh andy circus interview yeah this is

2555
06:00:57,520 --> 06:01:17,209
important what did they steal a major addict who who just needed to need yeah i compared him to

2556
06:01:17,209 --> 06:01:25,520
charge i think those nodding no i don't think that's correct because we're using motion capture a lot

2557
06:01:25,520 --> 06:01:29,680
um and the animators are watching my performance closely on screen and mapping

2558
06:01:30,400 --> 06:01:35,680
their animators keyframe animators are matching every expression it's called facial structure and

2559
06:01:35,680 --> 06:01:40,479
the way that his face moves is based on the form way mine does so it goes through three processes

2560
06:01:40,479 --> 06:01:44,720
i shoot on set with elijah and sean and we act all the scenes together this guy right here is

2561
06:01:44,720 --> 06:01:52,880
a pioneer repeating every single scene and then i do the final voice track yes precious the voice

2562
06:01:52,880 --> 06:01:59,759
was was really um born out of two things one was trying to find a psychological route into why he

2563
06:01:59,759 --> 06:02:07,720
speaks like that but actually in physical terms it it it came from i knew it we had three cats at

2564
06:02:08,040 --> 06:02:10,119
home and i knew it was a cat

2565
06:02:14,650 --> 06:02:15,049
what do they do

2566
06:02:24,880 --> 06:02:29,439
you know i'm getting my head back into thinking okay see you know this is great minds think alike

2567
06:02:29,439 --> 06:02:34,110
andy i agree all that through a game so it's actually quite nice to sort of visit where i'm

2568
06:02:34,110 --> 06:02:37,950
going to be going for the film it's probably you know an unusual way of doing it where you do the

2569
06:02:37,950 --> 06:02:42,909
do the voice for the game before you actually do the adr for the film that's kind of weird

2570
06:02:42,990 --> 06:02:49,150
and we be the master he did this first he had to do this first before they even did the movie

2571
06:02:49,150 --> 06:02:58,619
voice acting what's this one down here nothing here don't forget a perfect on every level

2572
06:03:01,150 --> 06:03:08,349
uh what about uh what about billy what about billy boy

2573
06:03:13,880 --> 06:03:18,840
thank you but not really you've just unlocked all these other characters like me one of them

2574
06:03:18,840 --> 06:03:25,720
being me so now you can take me and mary and anyone else to places that they didn't actually

2575
06:03:25,720 --> 06:03:34,520
go to like osgillia or paths of the dead yeah take pippin to paths of the dead let's see what

2576
06:03:34,520 --> 06:03:55,720
would happen if he went there okay let's take pippin to pippin to paths of the dead that's

2577
06:03:55,720 --> 06:04:12,409
pretty cool i'm just doing what the actor wanted me to do what would happen if it was in this war

2578
06:04:14,169 --> 06:04:21,290
it was made by those who are dead and the dead keep it the way is shut malice lies heavy in the

2579
06:04:21,290 --> 06:04:31,549
air the dead it's all right it's there's really no change here from behind there's no change

2580
06:04:32,430 --> 06:04:41,279
there's not a big difference here it's just another small guy i wonder what would happen

2581
06:04:41,279 --> 06:05:13,529
if if pippin were to be here the spirits of the dead pretty good actually pretty good pippin

2582
06:05:14,330 --> 06:05:28,700
not bad actually pippin's pretty good then no voice lines yet this should be more specters see

2583
06:05:30,060 --> 06:05:40,639
can pippin throw big things oh fuck he's pretty good that's not pippin yes it is

2584
06:05:58,119 --> 06:06:09,080
hello all right takes more than like three hits to die as level one um

2585
06:06:09,959 --> 06:06:25,950
why is he gonna play through this level right now does he have any lines he has to

2586
06:06:26,669 --> 06:06:44,029
when gimli talks he's gonna say something hey someone's saying currently reading the lord of

2587
06:06:44,029 --> 06:07:03,849
the rings books are you really nice star ever spoiling the whole series magic coming to the

2588
06:07:03,849 --> 06:07:09,130
stream and you're getting ready to read all the books and spend weeks or months reading all of

2589
06:07:09,130 --> 06:07:14,430
them you just watch what just happened with all of them i'm not gonna what i'm not gonna talk

2590
06:07:14,430 --> 06:07:27,069
about months yeah months it could take a long time to read a book especially the lord of the

2591
06:07:27,069 --> 06:07:32,459
rings the lord of the rings are huge you read like a chapter a night two chapters a night for

2592
06:07:32,459 --> 06:07:59,119
all the books it's probably take you it probably takes you fucking at least a few weeks everybody

2603
06:09:58,490 --> 06:10:02,490
really want to talk about gamers wrong or anything because i don't obviously don't want people that

2604
06:10:02,490 --> 06:10:06,090
haven't seen it or they're planning on getting interested or you know i don't want to be talking

2605
06:10:06,090 --> 06:10:09,450
about like well let me tell you about this part and this part of it no that's not we don't have to do

2606
06:10:09,450 --> 06:10:27,119
that but it's uh one of the big fans i wasn't a big fan pippen are you all right pippen you're

2607
06:10:27,119 --> 06:10:33,040
all right if it's dead okay uh now we know what happens pippen dies if he goes in there cool

2608
06:10:48,650 --> 06:10:55,450
all right let's get this one here we go mary what does mary have to say to us

2609
06:10:58,119 --> 06:11:06,759
very very well thank you a lot quicker than three and a half years to finish it excitement crazy

2610
06:11:06,759 --> 06:11:11,799
crazy excitement you've now unlocked two other characters what i have you can take mary or

2611
06:11:11,799 --> 06:11:16,360
pippen and you can go on any storyline you want i you could go and hang out with she loved for a

2612
06:11:16,360 --> 06:11:21,000
while what you could go with faramir and you know see what his journey's like that would be fun you

2613
06:11:21,000 --> 06:11:26,700
can hang out with gandalf because he's very protective and he feels like a father you can

2614
06:11:26,700 --> 06:11:31,580
do anything you want you can go anywhere you want with mary and pippen so this is now our

2615
06:11:31,580 --> 06:11:47,470
treat to you as a gamer mistake leave in the shire in the shire you know mary looks kind of

2616
06:11:47,470 --> 06:11:55,389
sweet and approachable as when he wears his war outfit he just can't think the people who would

2617
06:11:55,389 --> 06:11:59,869
choose all right so are mary and people mary and pippen the jar jar banks of that's more accurate

2618
06:11:59,869 --> 06:12:05,630
right highly intelligent people in the world no that's dead is the hobbit oh i want a sandwich

2619
06:12:05,630 --> 06:12:10,919
i want to have some no what are you talking about someone who you know comes to the table

2620
06:12:10,919 --> 06:12:15,319
that's more accurate than gauntlet physical strength but he's is wily and has a bit of

2621
06:12:15,319 --> 06:12:29,340
guile what about second breakfast yeah they say yeah they like kind of comic relief there are two

2622
06:12:29,340 --> 06:12:47,979
in c3po i don't think that's accurate either well i think we saw everything wait nope

2623
06:12:49,240 --> 06:12:58,349
we have one more interview with faramir was one of the few men who withstood the power of

2624
06:12:58,349 --> 06:13:05,819
faramir and boramir were brothers and it isn't beyond possibility that faramir went to rivendell

2625
06:13:05,819 --> 06:13:12,639
instead and if that happened faramir could have survived and returned to gondor you decide now

2626
06:13:12,639 --> 06:13:18,330
we're going to explore this fact by unlocking the character of faramir see for yourself what

2627
06:13:18,330 --> 06:13:27,310
else you might have done during the war at the ring good luck i mean it's i it's cool but

2628
06:13:28,110 --> 06:13:34,189
it's just you can just take the character you can i don't know it's for alternate time

2629
06:13:36,439 --> 06:13:42,520
game players should unlock faramir first because he's a character who is in possession of multi

2630
06:13:42,520 --> 06:13:48,439
skills he's a great swordsman great archer they actually get any different abilities or no

2631
06:13:48,439 --> 06:13:55,799
i think

2632
06:14:13,000 --> 06:14:15,000
high voltage gameplay guys it's pretty good

2633
06:14:17,000 --> 06:14:19,080
all right that's uh that's it

2634
06:14:20,520 --> 06:14:27,840
does the tree do anything though i didn't miss anything down here did i

2635
06:14:30,700 --> 06:14:36,619
you saw all the interviews all the production stills elijah wood on astin

2636
06:14:38,139 --> 06:14:49,389
game concept art film concept art hobbits on gaming this i'm glad we didn't miss this one

2637
06:14:49,389 --> 06:15:01,209
the best player would be elijah well this is where i get to to pat myself in the back i'm

2638
06:15:01,209 --> 06:15:08,970
definitely a better gamer than the two of them yes elijah has this insane ability of being able

2639
06:15:08,970 --> 06:15:14,430
to just uh grab hold of a console and go through a game i've actually made the the controller

2640
06:15:14,430 --> 06:15:19,709
float and without touching anything i've managed to play the game it's only happened a few times

2641
06:15:19,709 --> 06:15:25,479
but he's not even making that up it's probably real gaming now for probably years and he's doing

2642
06:15:25,479 --> 06:15:30,279
very well uh but i'm still a much more experienced gamer but i'm getting that i can be i wouldn't be

2643
06:15:30,279 --> 06:15:34,119
surprised if elijah wood could do that certainly a lot better he can do everything else he can

2644
06:15:34,119 --> 06:15:38,680
fucking sing he can dance he can act he can cook oh look at me go i'm on fire now he can like

2645
06:15:38,680 --> 06:15:43,799
lift big heavy fucking weights and shit i says okay give us a beat him three times in a row

2646
06:15:43,799 --> 06:15:51,080
billy's getting better but he's not great billy is awful one of the worst game players of all time

2647
06:15:51,080 --> 06:15:56,520
i think i do have a special gift for gaming you'll be playing a two-player game and you'll go billy

2648
06:15:56,520 --> 06:16:02,759
press x and he'll be like hang on a minute wait which one's x but i just haven't really opened

2649
06:16:02,759 --> 06:16:22,349
that gift yet and giving it to myself that was funny wait hold on no i got that one now we got

2650
06:16:22,349 --> 06:16:33,240
them all now we got them all all right guys i'm gonna call it here no vego interview yeah what's

2651
06:16:33,240 --> 06:16:39,400

2652
06:16:39,400 --> 06:16:44,400
they get orlando bloom for the last one too they were in the last one over the claw grip

2653
06:16:52,560 --> 06:17:00,169
did you give kim the 10 gifted fries yet no we have we actually haven't gone to any restaurant

2654
06:17:00,169 --> 06:17:14,159
that would even have them we just haven't we just haven't been there got a wink sure the last star

2655
06:17:14,159 --> 06:17:18,409
is hardcore mode but you have to probably defeat the game on heart but yeah that's a good place

2656
06:17:18,409 --> 06:17:24,240
to stop it we are now done with the lord of the rings for now that was good shorter than the last

2657
06:17:24,240 --> 06:17:28,240
one i thought we were gonna be playing this for a little bit longer but it's a good place to stop

2658
06:17:28,959 --> 06:17:33,549
so again tomorrow tomorrow i got uh some shit i gotta do physical therapy to do

2659

glad to have you back yeah february is going to be a little messed up

2705
06:24:44,060 --> 06:24:51,950
i think it'll this is one of the busiest months in a while i've got physical therapy going which

2706
06:24:51,950 --> 06:24:56,430
i have to go to and i have to stick to i don't know how many times a week this will be going

2707
06:24:57,470 --> 06:25:00,669
i'm gonna assume it's i will assume i have to probably do physical therapy

2708
06:25:01,790 --> 06:25:08,650
maybe once or twice a week whenever i have to do it i'm gonna do it so i'm gonna have to bounce

2709
06:25:08,650 --> 06:25:17,259
streams around and try to get them in and do this too why are you doing physical therapy because i

2710
06:25:17,259 --> 06:25:27,470
have costochondritis and i know i don't want to gross anybody out here but um i lean back

2711
06:25:28,639 --> 06:25:37,419
and stretch my rib cage a little and sort of tilt and move my chest it goes and it kind of hurts

2712
06:25:38,409 --> 06:25:41,849
it's and then it feels okay i look for a little bit it's like just kind of popping

2713
06:25:41,849 --> 06:25:49,720
weird it's pretty crunchy down there so costochondritis is inflammation in your rib cage

2714
06:25:51,560 --> 06:25:59,950
i just i was told it would make sense because i have um the colitis problems are autoimmune

2715
06:26:00,830 --> 06:26:04,750
and i was told that you know it's not out of the ordinary that for somebody that has

2716
06:26:05,630 --> 06:26:13,709
ibd which is autoimmune which is i've had it for years that something like this could pop up too

2717
06:26:13,709 --> 06:26:19,450
randomly because your body my body's just stupid and for some reason wants to attack itself

2718
06:26:20,250 --> 06:26:31,049
because i'm my body's dumb and i got a low iq fucking dna i don't understand i have now this

2719
06:26:31,049 --> 06:26:43,959
is like two potential autoimmune diseases which like what the fuck but uh going on physical

2720
06:26:43,959 --> 06:26:49,000
therapy i've been told helps a lot and in some cases can make the problem almost completely go

2721
06:26:49,080 --> 06:26:58,569
away we'll see i'm gonna give it a shot uh lm man thanks for the 10 bucks germa choo choo you

2722
06:26:58,569 --> 06:27:07,659
deserve a chew is that a space channel 5 reference sounds like it thanks for the thousand bits

2723
06:27:09,209 --> 06:27:15,549
ibuprofen is good for inflammation yeah i'm gonna give you some of my personal

2724
06:27:16,430 --> 06:27:26,250
um personal thoughts and personal beliefs here on this subject i don't want i don't like

2725
06:27:26,250 --> 06:27:34,270
here all right here we go i can go get an injection tomorrow into my nerve of steroids

2726
06:27:34,270 --> 06:27:41,290
and nerve blocker and i it might be i might be fine but i don't really like the idea of doing

2727
06:27:41,290 --> 06:27:47,319
that first and i don't like the idea of taking ibuprofen every day taking ibuprofen or tylenol

2728
06:27:47,319 --> 06:27:54,599
every day it's not it's really not great for you and i don't want to get into the habit of taking

2729
06:27:54,599 --> 06:27:59,759
three or four ibuprofen a day and saying man i feel this i feel fucking great i'm just going

2730
06:27:59,759 --> 06:28:05,740
to take four ibuprofen every day and then you're i'm essentially masking a problem that could be

2731
06:28:05,740 --> 06:28:12,200
fixed maybe potentially if i just did it and i don't really want to just use painkillers

2732
06:28:12,200 --> 06:28:20,139
to just put a blanket over a potential actual joint problem that i have that i could just

2733
06:28:20,139 --> 06:28:33,450
fix it's the same reason why i don't i really don't want to go on any like prescription pain

2734
06:28:33,450 --> 06:28:38,569
medicine i know that that's been floated around before of oh you you have like osteochondritis so

2735
06:28:38,569 --> 06:28:43,439
you have like joint problems you have a joint disease oh well you're gonna take vicodin you

2736
06:28:43,439 --> 06:28:48,169
know just a small dose every day no no i know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna

2737
06:28:48,169 --> 06:28:56,270
take i'm not gonna take i'm not gonna take one i don't want to even do that and that's what i've

2738
06:28:56,270 --> 06:29:00,750
told the doctor and the doctor also said that's a good idea just we'll see what happens with

2739
06:29:00,750 --> 06:29:11,580
physical therapy let's see what happens now in the event that physical therapy does not work

2740
06:29:12,919 --> 06:29:22,169
you know let's say i do physical therapy for the next four to six months and there is no progress

2741
06:29:22,169 --> 06:29:26,349
and if it get worse it could get worse i don't know at that point it's like okay i've done

2742
06:29:26,349 --> 06:29:37,080
physical therapy for six months let's do the injection and see what happens that's the plan

2743
06:29:37,080 --> 06:29:48,880
now it could take a couple years yeah but uh there's not a layer here and okay here's the

2744
06:29:48,880 --> 06:29:57,040
here's the other layer i you know i got stuff to do every day you know it's not just the stream

2745
06:29:57,599 --> 06:30:01,369
i want to be like on this stream and not have to even think about it i want to be able to

2746
06:30:01,369 --> 06:30:06,889
interact and have fun and do whatever i want to do and have it in the back of your mind that like

2747
06:30:06,889 --> 06:30:12,009
oh my like whole fucking rib cage hurts it's i you know i don't want to have three four years

2748
06:30:12,009 --> 06:30:17,470
from now like that it would get really fucking annoying and it would just sit in the back of my

2749
06:30:17,470 --> 06:30:25,159
head always so i mean i'm eventually here over the next six to 12 months i've got to have a

2750
06:30:25,159 --> 06:30:31,610
real solution for this i don't want this to turn into an issue that's i'm just sitting here and

2751
06:30:32,090 --> 06:30:43,279
hey guys i'm gonna go to the grocery store today oh my my fucking chest hurts but it's not an issue

2752
06:30:43,279 --> 06:30:54,860
that's life-threatening or that would really really debilitate me it's just annoying my rib

2753
06:30:54,860 --> 06:31:02,189
cage sucks that's pretty much it and i but i just really i also have to live my life too i'm not

2754
06:31:02,189 --> 06:31:07,470
gonna i am not taking any pain medicine i'm not doing any treatments i'm just gonna be in pain

2755
06:31:07,470 --> 06:31:11,630
here every day and um yeah that's what eventually i'm gonna have to do something

2756
06:31:11,630 --> 06:31:20,240
if something like physical therapy doesn't work but that road is very very very far in the future

2757
06:31:20,240 --> 06:31:26,990
don't forget to do the stuff the physical therapist tells you to do at home i'm going to be

2758
06:31:28,250 --> 06:31:35,599
i'm gonna follow 100 percent of the instructions no matter what they are this physical therapist

2759
06:31:35,599 --> 06:31:43,180
could tell me you have to eat lettuce every day for the next year i'm gonna turn fucking green

2760
06:31:43,180 --> 06:31:56,400
i'm gonna turn fucking green you know what i mean you don't do that already i mean i eat lettuce

2800
06:38:12,029 --> 06:38:21,400
i'm out uh tar alecron thanks for the 251 bits thanks to 250 germa how have you not used up your

2801
06:38:21,400 --> 06:38:26,599
bottle of cologne in 20 years you do realize that you need to spray it on you for it to make you

2802
06:38:26,599 --> 06:38:32,569
smell nice right um because i don't use very much because i don't want to be the person that walks

2803
06:38:32,569 --> 06:38:41,229
into a room and everybody tries to find the smell because you spray yourself more you give yourself

2804
06:38:41,229 --> 06:38:49,150
more than one or two spritz as a cologne you turn into the person that then just drops smell in

2805
06:38:49,549 --> 06:38:55,229
room they go in and then everyone has everyone goes who's get somebody of cologne on who's who

2806
06:38:55,229 --> 06:39:03,450
is that oh it might be me yeah yeah that's you well i like that but oh yeah that's you by the

2807
06:39:03,450 --> 06:39:10,169
way i was in the kitchen and you were in the living room when i asked this question so i like to just

2808
06:39:10,169 --> 06:39:16,750
do you do a little bit you just like a tiny like just a that's it right under the neck i lift my

2809
06:39:16,750 --> 06:39:25,259
chin up like i put my chin up right on the deck down or if you have uh the one that's not a spray

2810
06:39:25,259 --> 06:39:31,900
you just take one little on your finger and right under the under the jaw like like that's it you

2811
06:39:31,900 --> 06:39:44,220
done you don't need very much how many sprays let's see uh how many sprays are in a bottle of cologne

2812
06:39:47,689 --> 06:40:05,119
735 sprays in a 50 milliliter bottle bottle so i don't wear cologne every day if i spray that once

2813
06:40:06,080 --> 06:40:12,799
even once a week or once every two weeks when i go out or something that's fucking 10 to 20 years

2814
06:40:12,799 --> 06:40:26,830
worth of cologne you don't need to use very much and sometimes and if you and by the way no that

2815
06:40:26,830 --> 06:40:33,680
is accurate that's very accurate because no you don't have one bottle of cologne i i have like

2816
06:40:33,680 --> 06:40:39,680
10 different bottles of cologne you use one for like a couple days week goes by use the next one

2817
06:40:39,680 --> 06:40:46,909
two weeks go by use the next one you you're always recycling colognes you don't do the same scent you

2818
06:40:46,909 --> 06:40:58,409
do a bunch you do like at least four or five of them to change it up who wears cologne i don't

2819
06:40:59,049 --> 06:41:05,470
this is my point my point is i wear cologne maybe once every like three to four weeks and i spray

2820
06:41:05,549 --> 06:41:20,700
one time so yes if i spray one spray a month that's 735 months what's the math there 735

2821
06:41:20,700 --> 06:41:30,919
divided by 12 let's see okay so i have 61 years worth of cologne that's not right what that's 60

2822
06:41:30,919 --> 06:41:36,680
yeah it is right okay i have 60 fucking years worth of cologne it's i don't know that's not

2823
06:41:36,680 --> 06:41:46,990
hard to understand you got to pass it down it's like whiskey you don't drink a bottle of nice

2824
06:41:47,069 --> 06:41:51,709
whiskey all in the same weekend i mean some of you guys might but fucking be careful for god's

2825
06:41:51,709 --> 06:42:07,040
sakes anyways where were we oh all right we're at germa sucks for five community subs thanks a lot

06:42:09,200 --> 06:42:12,479
ancient sasquatch thanks for 250 germa thanks for the stream any chance we could have a few

2827
06:42:12,479 --> 06:42:19,599
details about the charity rumble like if there's any special you want to do for it or even an eta

2828
06:42:19,599 --> 06:42:27,049
uh there is no eta on it but it's going to happen at some point before april because the marathon

2829
06:42:27,049 --> 06:42:39,400
is in april so we would need to do it before then so it's going to happen before april isn't

2830
06:42:39,400 --> 06:42:45,950
that an eta yeah i guess it is estimated time yeah before april that's not really a time that's more

2831
06:42:45,950 --> 06:42:53,159
of a estimated time to end it you know what i mean that that that's like it could it could be

2832
06:42:53,159 --> 06:43:00,409
tomorrow or it could be march 31st that's a huge time frame yeah that's not like an eta that's a

2833
06:43:00,409 --> 06:43:13,419
big giant time frame call it what you will for real though thanks for the 250 i don't know if

2834
06:43:13,419 --> 06:43:20,509
you're aware but the vermintide devs made a rats reference i actually did see this i did see the

2835
06:43:20,509 --> 06:43:29,400
rats rats where the rats the vermintide to uh patch notes or something right whatever it was

2836
06:43:29,400 --> 06:43:43,200
news yeah yeah there is no it just the title of their uh dev update is just rats rats where the

2837
06:43:43,200 --> 06:43:50,520
rats they don't go into and by the way oh my god germa is so great it's just a one line actually

2838
06:43:51,000 --> 06:43:59,319
from i was reading a few threads about this and apparently the rats that rats movie and the rat

2839
06:43:59,319 --> 06:44:03,400
clip there's a clip going around that's that people know what it is but people might not know

2840
06:44:03,400 --> 06:44:09,689
that it's from this channel from my understanding the rats have turned into their own thing that

2841
06:44:09,689 --> 06:44:20,490
aren't even connected to me anymore it's just thing and whatever it's you know the student

2842
06:44:20,490 --> 06:44:23,930
becomes the master as they say it's just going the rats don't need you though they don't need

2843
06:44:24,569 --> 06:44:38,889
their they're going off to college they're gonna be their own rats they've entered meme hood yeah

2844

my job as director to talk to christopher lee and to explain to him what i what i wanted so i started

2874
06:49:30,090 --> 06:49:35,930
to go into this long explanation about what sort of sound he should make when he got stabbed i seem

2875
06:49:35,930 --> 06:49:43,209
to recall that i did say to peter have you any idea of what kind of noise happens when somebody

2878
06:50:02,720 --> 06:50:07,680
war two he used to be in the the british secret service whatever they were shit really he seemed

2879
06:50:07,680 --> 06:50:12,400
to have expert knowledge of exactly the sort of noise that they make and so i just sort of

2880
06:50:12,959 --> 06:50:16,639
didn't push the subject any further i just said well you obviously know what to do christopher

2881

2915
06:55:33,439 --> 06:55:36,720
content since middle school and now i'm in college it's so weird to think about that

2916
06:55:36,720 --> 06:55:41,759
it really is i'm mostly donating to tell you about a weird dream i had about you

2917
06:55:41,759 --> 06:55:46,799
it wasn't anything too freaky like you having sex on stream but anyway i was helping a school

06:55:46,799 --> 06:55:53,020
throw out old textbooks and one of the textbooks was a germa 985 textbook it had outdated channel

2919
06:55:53,020 --> 06:56:02,090
memes and a whole chapter dedicated to explaining twitch chat also the textbook was tiny what an

2920
06:56:02,090 --> 06:56:10,959
odd book that book would not be very big the germa 985 textbook of what would okay the germa

06:56:10,959 --> 06:56:19,959
985 textbook would be like a 30 page forward from me and then eight pages of actual content and 14

2926
06:57:11,240 --> 06:57:15,319
for the 250 you mentioned fallen order earlier while i haven't played it i do recommend looking

2927
06:57:15,319 --> 06:57:21,610
into older star wars games public commando is an underplayed fps classic the jedi night series or

2928
06:57:21,610 --> 06:57:25,709
force unleashed both have some good lightsaber stuff in there for you you can never go wrong

2929
06:57:25,709 --> 06:57:33,319
with playing 2005 battlefront 2 personally older cult classics make for more fun streams compared

2930
06:57:33,319 --> 06:57:45,799
to hot triple a titles that are mostly cut scenes keep on standing out yeah i mean i don't really

2931
06:57:45,799 --> 06:57:53,360
play the old games to necessarily try to do something different i just remember these being

2932
06:57:53,360 --> 06:58:02,669
crazy and fun and ridiculous i remember playing a lot of these and when we get on a string of

2933
06:58:02,669 --> 06:58:08,250
oh yeah i went and i grabbed 10 ps2 games that i remember playing that was i thought were crazy

2934
06:58:08,250 --> 06:58:20,880
i get to kind of relive it which is interesting too for me it's not that i'm trying to avoid

2935
06:58:22,060 --> 06:58:27,759
big new triple a titles it's just nothing's come out that's really

2936
06:58:27,759 --> 06:58:31,520
want grabbed my attention and made me want to play it for more than a minute

2937
06:58:32,159 --> 06:58:42,409
there's been some indie stuff you know those small not triple a budget games that we played on this

2938
06:58:42,409 --> 06:58:53,639
channel over the last year the phantom menace game is really bad but i love it yeah i remember

2939
06:58:53,639 --> 06:59:03,389
some of those i'm a bounty hunter was pretty fun outer wilds is amazing yeah but that's not a

2940
06:59:03,389 --> 06:59:09,549
necessarily a triple a experience i don't know if one comes along and i think it's

2941
06:59:09,549 --> 06:59:19,689
worth playing i'll do it or worth streaming is a better way to put that i agree atro locks atrox

07:00:42,959 --> 07:00:51,919
sound like a good time at all i'm not sure how old you are but that does not sound like an

2954
07:00:51,919 --> 07:00:58,080
environment that you would want to be in i don't know the story here or why or what's going on

2955
07:00:58,799 --> 07:01:08,299
but stay safe hopefully you can get out of that scenario in that environment sooner rather than

2956
07:01:08,299 --> 07:01:22,459
later thanks for hanging out here though we absolutely welcome anybody especially anyone

2957
07:01:23,930 --> 07:01:32,159
that's trying just to get away from something but i will implore you this stream is a good

2958
07:01:32,159 --> 07:01:41,049
place to hang out but i do want to make it really clear that if you're having some kind of issue or

2959
07:01:41,049 --> 07:01:46,569
some kind of problem i hope you can find the necessary steps to solve it and start to go down

2960
07:01:46,569 --> 07:01:53,610
the road to fix it or at least try to because this stream can only be here to be a stream

2961
07:01:56,619 --> 07:02:01,040
and i know that does a lot for people but i really hope that you can also

2962
07:02:01,040 --> 07:02:07,130
take the steps necessary to try to get better or try to fix your scenario because this stream

2963

07:05:15,150 --> 07:05:21,340
i like i didn't i don't have a bad time with these games a mountain blade war band it was

2981
07:05:21,340 --> 07:05:27,040
i think it was just overwhelming to me hey okay hold on let me i gotta i gotta rebuttal some of

2982
07:05:27,040 --> 07:05:32,959
these for you uh the lord of the rings games are just old and very very difficult just by their

2983
07:05:32,959 --> 07:05:36,560
nature so i'm gonna i'm gonna get frustrated at some points it's i mean doesn't mean i don't like

2984
07:05:36,560 --> 07:05:43,500
the game uh mountain blade war band overwhelmed me and uh i believe people in chat were calling me

2985
07:05:43,500 --> 07:05:48,860
like a stupid and an idiot and that i smelled and that my stream sucked uh so that was that one uh

2986
07:05:48,860 --> 07:05:51,900
i mean it was overwhelming a little bit halo reach was the worst stream of the year last year

2987
07:05:51,900 --> 07:05:58,279
because me and joel played it so i mean this is i didn't not hate these games

2988
07:06:06,169 --> 07:06:11,360
but i mean it's not like i would never mountain blade war band is just kind of not a game for me

2989
07:06:12,439 --> 07:06:17,319
it's a lot it's a kind of lot going on you have to pay attention to a ton of stuff at the same time

2990
07:06:18,220 --> 07:06:23,659
this it's like kind of like moving pieces on a big game board chat i you know that's kind of

2991
07:06:23,659 --> 07:06:33,310
just not my thing it's really really interesting and i i do love that people love that series

2992
07:06:35,040 --> 07:06:45,799
joel ruined halo no it really did i'm uh the honesty is the best policy let's use it here

2993
07:06:46,729 --> 07:06:51,450
i mean they like ruined all halo for me like all of halo not that stream but just that the idea of

2994
07:06:51,450 --> 07:06:57,819
that gap was that ruined every halo game i can't play halo ever again it has nothing to do with

2995
07:06:57,819 --> 07:07:02,220
it has nothing to do with joe it has nothing to do with joe he didn't do anything out of the

2996
07:07:02,220 --> 07:07:08,759
ordinary it's just like that stream i just like i can never play halo ever again it has nothing

2997
07:07:08,759 --> 07:07:20,040
to do with joe god damn it joe ps you should play warhammer 40k dawn of war one that's literally

07:10:27,520 --> 07:10:31,759
join in live for many of them i would donate more and sub to the channel but i'm only a mere

3022
07:10:31,759 --> 07:10:38,000
poor college boy don't worry about that keep your money save it use it for something good for you

3023
07:10:38,000 --> 07:10:46,119
take care of yourself first always but uh how do you get the garlic and honey um it's water too

3024
07:10:46,119 --> 07:10:52,639
drink a bunch of water always be drinking water over the course of the day try to get you know

3025
07:10:53,279 --> 07:11:03,049
cut out uh replace like three or four drinks a day that you drink normally with water helps also

3026
07:11:03,049 --> 07:11:08,189
stay away from cheese start cutting cheese out of your life i know that's hard and it's horrible

3027
07:11:08,189 --> 07:11:15,630
for me to say okay uh let me go over what just happened there um i started to almost choke on

3028
07:11:15,630 --> 07:11:22,299
the air that i was breathing and i had to make that noise otherwise i would have choked on air

3029
07:11:22,299 --> 07:11:28,639
okay just start stay away from cheese don't eat that much cheese drink more water try to eat at

3030
07:11:28,639 --> 07:11:44,299
least one vegetable group a day cheese is good but just don't do don't eat too much cheese that's

3031
07:11:44,299 --> 07:11:56,909
advice from the 1950s um eat less cheese increase your garlic intake and drink water is that's just

3032
07:11:56,909 --> 07:12:11,340
like hey you want to be a healthy motherfucker or not uh dr house even says don't eat cheese

that's tough though i've talked about the losing animals and being separated from animals before

3143
07:29:35,819 --> 07:29:40,139
and the way that i've dealt with it each time is you give yourself some time to grieve about it and

3144
07:29:41,419 --> 07:29:46,459
sort of try to remember but move on and then take care of another one take care of another animal

3145
07:29:46,459 --> 07:29:57,709
bring another animal into your life dog cat rabbit lizard don't matter keep the love going
