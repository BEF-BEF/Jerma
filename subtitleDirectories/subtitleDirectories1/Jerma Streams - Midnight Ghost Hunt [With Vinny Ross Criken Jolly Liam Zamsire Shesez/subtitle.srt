1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:11,240
Oh hello, how are you? Alright, currently in the middle of a game. We've got a big thing going

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:21,030
on here today, but real quick before we get started. Really quickly. Hold on, I'm hearing

3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:27,030
two things in my ear at the same time. We're doing Midnight Ghost Hunt with a huge group.

4
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:32,979
Let me go over and do this real quick though. I know Shito is supposed to be on camera. Let's

5
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:53,100
go ahead and do that real quick. One sec. Okay, so here you go. Here we go. You guys ready?

6
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:17,299
It doesn't have batteries.

7
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,760
Alright, I ate it. Alright, we're gonna play it again. I don't know why there's no batteries

8
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,500
every time. Alright, I gotta get into the game. Welcome everybody. We're playing. There's no facecam

9
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:47,829
today. Turn it off. Alright, here we go. I'm currently live right now. I just want to let

10
00:01:47,829 --> 00:02:02,010
everybody know that there is a live audience watching you right now. Hi. Okay, so we...

11
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,379
What's the... Oh, I'm not talking to them. Why am I doing zero damage? I have to hold the button

12
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:15,159
down. What? I will kill you. Can somebody give like a quick 15 second like how this game works?

13
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:25,449
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This proximity, I can hear you. I have to find out where you are.

14
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:37,659
Where are you? Stunning. I have no idea what's going on. Oh, I tabbed out and I died, I think.

15
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:50,969
What do you mean no audio? There's audio. You can hear that. How do you guys not hear that? Turn it up.

16
00:02:50,969 --> 00:03:02,759
I gotta hit you, dude. What was that? You can hear that just fine. Can you hear me right now?

17
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,520
I can hear you, yeah. Okay, okay, cool. I think I died. You guys can resuscitate me if you guys

18
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,240
get the defibrillator thing. Sorry, yeah, I got distracted by several ghosts running around.

19
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:20,919
Yeah, I alt tab to start capture and... You got murdered? I got murdered. Okay, I got you.

20
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:28,310
This game is fun. Yeah, I'm liking it so far. All right. Oh, you're all screwed. Killer plant behind

21
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:38,969
you. Holy shit. Oh, I'm back. I got guy behind, guy behind. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm knocked

22
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:44,169
out. Neither do I. Am I shooting teammates? What's happening?

23
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,270
I don't have time, Ross. I'm sorry. No, you're all good, man. Okay, are we good?

24
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:17,430
Yeah. Good try. That's better. Okay, all right. That was a cool little warmup.

25
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,060
It's all right. Yeah. Now I understand how the game works. All right, so we got Vinny,

26
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,339
we got Criken, we got Ross, we got other people. I'm gonna end this lobby, hop back into the call,

27
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:35,769
we'll get started, and then we'll hop into a new one. Sounds good. Okay, sounds good. All right,

28
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:39,370
so that was the warmup. We're just gonna be doing a little introduction here. This is not Elden Ring.

29
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:51,019
No, it's not. Okay, so we had to jump into a little lobby. Remember, you're streaming. Oh,

30
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:57,050
yeah. Oh, I want to go over quickly. Really quickly. Uh, quick before I have to get in the

31
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:05,110
server. Oh, right. So tomorrow, the idea was I was gonna do DOS games tomorrow. We're changing that.

32
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,600
Wrestling Empire got a huge update, and we're gonna play it. I want a little bit more time

33
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,529
to curate the DOS stuff. We'll do DOS this weekend. Wrestling Empire tomorrow. There apparently was

34
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:24,329
an unbelievably hilarious update. I have to play it, so that's what we're doing tomorrow.

35
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:33,129
Are we using the same, uh, let me just confirm. Same code? So this game is kind of like Prop Hunt,

36
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:40,170
but it's like Left 4 Dead and Prop Hunt combined. Seems like fun. I did the tutorial. We're just

37
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:49,750
trying to do audio testing to make sure it works. This game sucks. I have eight minutes in the game.

38
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,370
Can we relax for a second, please? Can we just relax for a moment, please?

39
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,490
And you've seen, you've seen like us audio testing.

40
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:18,519
Okay, let me check. Is this the same code? I think we're doing a different code.

41
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:26,389
Why are you so tense? I'm good. This game is worse than Elden Ring. Well, not every game can be Elden

42
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:37,910
Ring. I'm sorry. Got a new code. Yeah, I, this is, I was gonna just wait to stream tomorrow,

43
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,800
but yeah, we're here. Good to see, uh, this group again. Vinny, Kraikin, these guys. It's been a

44
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,910
long time since I played with Kraikin. Or Vinny. Or Ross. It's been a while. All right, here we go.

45
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,300
I like how the game actually has like a lobby system though. So we don't have to have like

46
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:11,860
10 people at each other on Steam, which can always kind of be a pain in the ass.

47
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:21,129
Did that work? It worked. Okay. All right. You guys ready? How come you're so tense?

48
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:30,279
I'm a tense person. I went in for a massage like the other day and the person could not need.

49
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,189
They couldn't. It was like a brick. They were like, all right, that's like funny. Take off

50
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,509
like the cement jacket. And I was like, what are you talking about? My mic is off? What?

51
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:46,839
No, we're good. I just want to make sure that the lobby code's not here. It's not. All right. I can,

52
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:54,199
I can put it up. Can you hear me? I feel like that's been the whole stream so far for like the

53
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:01,209
first 10 minutes. It's like, Hey dude, can you hear me? Can you hear me? All right. So I'm on

54
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:05,610
the hunter team. The, our goal is to hunt the ghosts, just like prop hunt. People can hide in

55
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:19,740
chairs and, and curtains and all that shit. He's too tense. No, I'm, I'm, I'm a very tense person.

56
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:33,929
You're my favorite. Thank you. This seems fun. It does seem fun. Let's try it. I'm waiting for

57
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:42,259
players. So it looks like this, what do we got on this team? Vinnie, Liam, she says, I'm sorry.

58
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:49,529
Cricut. All right. So we're all right. This is a good team. This is a good team. Let's just start

59
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:56,710
doing yoga. No, yo yoga freaks me out because I get, I get even more tense in yoga because I

60
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:06,919
know I can't do the moves and I, it's embarrassing. It's like, Oh, put your leg over here and put your

61
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,279
head over this way and like raise your arm and leg up. And I can't do it. And I just ended up sitting

62
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:19,899
on the, on the pad like this until the next move. I just like, I don't want to do it. I can do the

63
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:27,960
really easy ones. Why would I even pay to do yoga with like a yoga instructor? If there's three moves

64
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:35,210
that I can do, I could just do those here and save whatever X amount of dollars it is to go

65
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:45,289
to yoga. You're inflexible. Well, yeah. The last like two or three years, you know, spamming

66
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:55,879
resident sleepers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So I want to use, I don't have

67
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:03,720
any money, so it doesn't matter. Vacuum. Once a ghost is dead, you suck them up. I'll just start.

68
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,909
I'm just going to go with whatever I need. All right. Let's do it. All right. What do you say?

69
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:15,299
We say guys, there's nobody here. Oh, hello. Ready to catch some ghost. Hi team. We're,

70
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:24,490
I think we're only doing C. Sorry. This is Q. Yeah. Oh, you too. You can do load out and then

71
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:36,059
you come in. Yeah. Is that DMCA? I'm scared. Oh, was that? No, no, no. I don't think this is

72
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,750
DMCA. I'm sure it's fine. No, yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Okay. Audio jungle. It is?

73
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:53,940
No, I'm just messing around. This reminds me of the DMC five van. What is going on? Yeah. Then

74
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,019
where is the beeping? Uh, no, not. Oh, so drama. Do you remember the beeping when we last hunted

75
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:06,740
ghosts? I do. What did you figure out what it was? Yeah, it was a, it's a faulty headset that I ended

76
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:14,059
up EQing out. It's a long story, but it is, but you actually had a broken headset. My VR headset

77
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:19,419
was broken and came with bleeps. That was, that's weird that it did. You would, you're echoing now.

78
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:26,970
That was weird. In proximity. We're all like, I think it's ambiance. Every time you turn your

79
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,850
head, I stopped being able to hear you well. Like it's just, that's, we have to face each other

80
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:38,169
when we talk. Yeah, we have to face each other. Look at me in the eye. Does anyone of you spin

81
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:45,639
while holding down a note? We have to make eye contact. All right, let's do this. Let, let us,

82
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:53,190
let us hunt well. We have to be so close. Let us hunt fiercely. Yeah. All right. It's the rep.

83
00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:03,590
Use, uh, remember your buddy system. It's the Tyrannosaurus. It's the deer. So wait, is there a,

84
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,629
should we not shoot anything? Should we, is there a downfall to do that? There doesn't seem to be a

85
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:13,909
penalty to, you know, we can, we can hit whatever we want. Like I'm going to hit Jupiter right now

86
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:25,669
because fuck Jupiter. There might be a planet. Is there a ghost in here? There's definitely a ghost.

87
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:34,179
If you are a ghost, say hi. Uh, guys, I don't think they're fucking in here. I was doing,

88
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:48,840
I was doing global. We agreed. We're going to do only global to start. And if it sucks,

89
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,759
we don't do it anymore. Oh, okay. I get you. I've been doing proximity the whole time.

90
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:58,620
Okay. Let's, yeah. Well, I'm sorry. Yes. Proximity we'll be doing. Yes. I think it's more fun.

91
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:06,259
That's in a weird space. That's in a weird place right there. Oh, where'd he go? Where'd he go?

92
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,899
What was it? What was it? I don't know, but it was, it was this thing. He's gone.

93
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,179
There's another duck. Yo, I just like duck. No. Whoa. Whoa. Did I not have shot the duck?

94
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:29,340
What happened? Was that, was it a ghost? I think that's a glitch, but okay. That's a video game

95
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:42,460
ghost technically. Yeah. This, I can't wait to be the ghost. Oh shit. Uh, uh, I'm going to go down a

96
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:51,590
ground floor. Oh, I think Vinny. Where are they? I think they're reading in this room.

97
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:57,299
Oh, that's right. We have a, uh, a reader. I forgot about that. How do you pull up the reader?

98
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,720
Uh, you gotta have it in your inventory and it's pressing number two on the, oh shit. Okay.

99
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:11,940
Oh, I thought that was just a bug. Oh, what was it? Oh, there's somebody right here. It was,

100
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:20,820
it was fucking Ross. Ross ghost. What? What? Why is he standing still? I got a vacuum here.

101
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:31,500
Okay. Great. Nice. Why would you just stand in there? Did he DC? I think he's, he didn't know.

102
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:38,070
I heard him though. See, since we're all doing, uh, proximity, Oh God. Yeah. Proximity is global.

103
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,590
So if, since we're all present, we give each other's positions away. Oh, it's kind of fun though.

104
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,909
Yeah. You guys see any,

105
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:56,440
Whoa, any ghosts around? I'm just friendly space, man.

106
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:05,500
That's a personal jelly. I was so focused on the reader that I didn't know you guys

107
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,299
were shooting a space, man. It's literally one minute to midnight. What's that mean?

108
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:14,840
What's that mean? Uh, at midnight? They can kill us at midnight. All right.

109
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:23,139
Into a vacuum can come back and still kill us, but they're weakened. I got a defib so I can oh well

110
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,139
I shouldn't have said that because then they'll single me out

111
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,860
Does anyone need help? I have a health kit. I

112
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:40,200
Think I think we're pretty good. There's only what two more. I'm going up. Oh, yeah. Oh you're one of these pots, okay?

113
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,559
That's what I would do

114
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:54,990
Really? I would have gone to one of those pots. So in 17 seconds, they're gonna attack us

115
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:01,710
Don't they build up a negative attribute if they stay still?

116
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:11,139
Yeah, Jerma, they build up ectoplasm and then they become more

117
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,700
Easily discoverable. All right, they still yeah

118
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:20,740
We we should probably stick actually maybe not stick together because then they'll kill us easier in group. Oh, yeah, we should

119
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,320
Oh my god, that was fast

120
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,710
Why is this what is the mammoth? Oh

121
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,360
My god

122
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,539
Nice good

123
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,220
There is

124
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,080
Jolly

125
00:16:48,080 --> 00:17:02,740
God damn it plant. I can't we kill this I

126
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:15,559
Got him we do it. Yeah, it's just one. It's one left criken now one one. Yes, right

127
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Right here plant plant plant

128
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,069
photo synthesize this oh

129
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:26,630
Yeah

130
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:34,519
Sorry, I'm good. I just got a way too excited. I'm so I'm out my parts beating. Oh look at us. So cool

131
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,680
Yeah, why oh man that's we look like

132
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,759
bootleg pyro

133
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,859
Like it's like a flash mob. Imagine being that excited

134
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,059
That excited over like the totally care about in this cheap pop ripoff. I leveled up

135
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:54,119
You suck is the first game relax

136
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,569
All right. Um, let's keep this team one more time and then we'll find out how to shuffle

137
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:04,190
Sure. Also remember when you're a ghost if you need to leave

138
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:15,990

145
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,650
How do I get out? How do I get out of here?

146
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,400
The proximity chat is so fucking low. I can barely hear you dude. It's it's yeah, it's very far

147
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:31,200
Like it's like impossible to hear you. So but yeah, I'm gonna I'm using that too

150
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:53,839
All right. Listen, I'm gonna corrupt these pigs. Oh my god. I'm so stupid. I walked right into their base

151
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,420
Should we both be sitting here at the same time Liam? Maybe I should move should I move?

152
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,180
No, maybe I should move. I don't know. I'm smaller. I'm smaller. I'm smaller. I don't know, but you're a bigger talk

153
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:10,119
I'll move I'll move common courtesy. Okay, be careful. Be careful. I'm so concerned

154
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:17,269
All right. I've corrupted the pigs. So now if the hunters like attack them, they'll get like damaged

155
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:26,470
I don't belong where I'm building up. Okay. Oh, what's the deal with the generator? Do we do anything with that?

156
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,769
That's where the hunters resupply

157
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,289
Okay shit

158
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:49,609

00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,250
Here we go. I gotta clear the

162
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:16,039
When do they come out? When do they actually start to come out? They they're they've been out. They just haven't been anywhere around here

163
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,849
Yeah, Oh

00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,630
Scared this shit out of me. Just just role-playing

165
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:41,140
That scared the shit out of me too. Why am I so jumpy right now? Are they I don't like this

166
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:52,000
Should I go on the plant? I feel like I could hide that. Why am I a gigantic target?

167
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:01,380
Hey, oh that oh, okay. Good. Just make sure that was you. Yeah, I'm just

168
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,569
Role-playing as a duck right now. What happens if you get to red ectoplasm? Oh

169
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:15,329
Red ectoplasm means that their instruments can detect you very easily. So you got to like

170
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:20,130
Jump out of like jump around or jump out into different crops

171
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,400
Oh, that's a ghost that's a ghost right here right here

172
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,599
I

173
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:50,130
Don't get it. I don't I don't know what happened back. I don't get it

174
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,450
I don't know the head spectral or I don't know the spectrum. Are you bullshit? Did you get sucked up?

175
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,730
I got sucked up. No, you got sucked up. I had the ectoplasm. Okay

176
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:05,180
All right, if you survive, you can come back if we survived. All right, cool. Cool. Cool. I

177
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:13,150
Didn't understand the ectoplasm. Oh my god. My corruption is detonated. I would have stayed put

178
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,349
And I'd they're all downstairs wait you wait

179
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:29,500
Like blocking their way crash I was on the but I was at the bottom of the staircase Oh long way

180
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Well, I'm walking their exit

181
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,940
Chasing me, but I'm back now. I freaked out cuz it was had a red ectoplasm. Whatever

182
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:42,539
If they come upstairs, let me know I can like just jump downstairs. This is kind of fun, though

183
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm just trying to clear my ectoplasm, but I don't see them near you

184
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,349
She says I walked into him. I'm an idiot

185
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,369
Germa is in the same room as you but yeah, they they don't yeah

186
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:03,690
So what I can go look that is that cheating you you can you can cut fuck with them a little bit right now

187
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,809

188
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,500
Yeah, you'll never they'll never know if you want. I'll never know. I'll never know

189
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,220

Suck him harder

194
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:17,900
All right nice job mammoth tusk wins

195
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:28,500
Three ghosts destroyed three hunters knocked out. Well nice work. I'm starting to get it

196
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,039
Okay, cool. All right, great. Yeah. No, yeah

197
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,119
Hopefully I think we get a new map now and I think maybe it'll scramble the teams if not we can do a

198
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,990
You will scramble. Yeah, whatever

199
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:49,849
Whatever works true true after whatever you got absolutely carried

200
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:55,190
Stop rocking back and forth. You look old. I'm rocking. Wait, what do you mean like this?

201
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:57,849
That's it. I don't know. It's just fun to do

202
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:04,569
All right, let me see this other stuff here. I have 1600 credit

203
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:18,150
All it replaces that I think I'll try it I want to try this thing and

204
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,869
Giving us the same team teams

205
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,480
Well, you want you want to do like three or four matches in a row at the same teams and then three or four

206
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
You know, I'm saying change it back to three or four or something

207
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Okay. Yeah, that sounds good

208
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,839
I'm down for whatever this one

209
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:42,519
German, what's your chin exercise routine? Look up at the sky like this and you want to put your

210
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,000
like this and one two three

211
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
I'm gonna assume this is a DMCA

212
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,559
You go up with your job

213
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,359
No, also another one. Another good one is

214
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:05,200
Is that even real though? It probably sounds close enough to another song to get DMC aid

215
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,269
So that can happen. I mean I have like

216
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:16,869
6,000 or so videos on my full sauce channel and every day something new is getting claimed that that makes zero sense

217
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:19,960
Yeah, it's it's it's kind of crazy

218
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,849
Dude, I had crickets. I played the sound effect of crickets

219
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:28,849
Not like because I made a bad joke and the crickets got claimed. It's the funny face guy

220
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:41,160
That's unreal. Yeah. All right. So now that we who dared to claim that probably cricket

221
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,769
It was criken on behalf of crickets

222
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,369
All right, the ghost meter is actually pretty I would say like required

223
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:59,400
Yeah, I would yeah as long as what does anybody have a

224
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,799
Vacuum, I think we need at least one person with a vacuum, right? Oh, okay. I've defected

225
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,079
Just just look at all with your exercise. How hard are you doing that?

226
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,359
I got a ghost over here guys just warm up on me if you want to kill it

227
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,720
I'm making like a just don't don't let on that. You know, the ghost is there. Okay, never mind. What are you talking about? I

228
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,220
Didn't say yeah one into your room to the other while you like put your chin out

229
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:38,400
I said literally go like this. So technically the game is on right now and then we are like looking for them right now

230
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,440
It's not like a like a minute. Yeah. Yeah, this is as soon as the hunters join in it's on. Okay, cool

231
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:52,109
I'm on Ross's tail right now. He's a box. Oh, where'd he go was?

232
00:28:53,299 --> 00:29:01,559
Now I see I'm so close picked up something over here over here picked up something over here. Okay, I have my ghost rail

233
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,279
Oh, yeah, there's there we got some activity in this room. Yeah, there is activity. There is activity. Oh

234
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:18,299
No idea what I'm doing. Hey ghosts

235
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:37,339
A little bit of activity over here. Wait, there's somebody in this room. Never mind up, dude

236
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:47,029
Got him in the room. He's a box. He's a studio stereo equipment box on it. Okay

237
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,549
Wait, what where do you go? What do you go? He's too quickly. What happened? Where'd he go?

238
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:13,079
Where did he go? Where'd he go? I don't know where he is, but he's here

239
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
This thing is so slow to shoot

240
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:23,299
Yeah, I thought I'd like the machine gun thing, but I don't

241
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:31,450
Well, I gotta go to resupply. Hold on. This thing is poop. Can I go up the ladder?

242
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:41,940
There's somebody literally right here the lantern

243
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:04,099
I'm not getting any readings. No, I think we got we just absolutely we got been had we got played big-time

244
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:16,680
Here I

245
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,640
Think I think he escaped

246
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,519
Damn it. Oh, he's right here. He's like he's literally in this room

247
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:29,839
He has to be the rate of the mark. The market is nothing market. It's not like a stock. It's going wild right now

248
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:53,700
What oh god right here somebody right here right here has to be right here

249
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:59,509
Good call good call

250
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:07,269
Jolly jolly, do we all have the melee weapon? Does anybody have a gun?

251
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,230
Damage

252
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Shotgun I've ever charged

253
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,769
Gotcha

254
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:27,079
There's a fake me running around is that I it's dead now. Oh, it's midnight. Well, here we go right here

255
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,920
Criken is a pot our father who art in heaven

256
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,759
hallowed be thy name

257
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,759
Thy kingdom come will be done

258
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:39,160
heaven oh

259
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,940
God god

260
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,460
Dude, I'd love to revive you guys, but uh

261
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,619
Okay, this is in Christ. We have failed that melee weapon sucks

262
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,660
Yeah, yeah, I'm not using that anymore

263
00:32:57,339 --> 00:33:00,259
So many of these weapons are like kind of

264
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,220
truce

265
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,210
Half of us are using the the little like a light stick

266
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:21,480
Need to level up arcane. I feel like yeah, it's like the combine weapon from half-life to it kind of is you know

267
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:34,319
Who's still alive? I am I'm just booking it. I'm just trying to like outlast. I guess I don't know what to do

268
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,400
I'm literally watching me when I asked that question for some reason. I thought that you were

269
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:48,200
Don't know why I thought it was a ghost. I thought we were ghosts for one second. Oh my god. Oh my god

270
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,279
Is this working out? They're just chasing you. I think I mean it's working, but there's

271
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah

272
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,549
I'm gonna play the wrestling game tomorrow. Should I just take the L?

273
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:04,589
You can do whatever you think is correct my brother and Geist

274
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,920
Perform an accelerated back off through the theater

275
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,159
Book it to the next QPU

276
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:18,699
Yeah, I will but what is that? This is what you see in Mario said in Mario 64

277
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:24,820
QPUs are positional universes fucking so that we need to talk about parallel universes

278
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:31,150
Why can they not get you does anybody do they have them a move? They're just running behind

279
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:35,400
Yeah, all right ghost moves, right?

280
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:48,320
Yeah, go team chair

281
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,599
The chair when oh my god ghost after this next round when the next map is about to happen

282
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,519
I'm gonna exit and we can all join a new lobby and we'll go into new teams

283
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:10,469
All right, I get it. I like I want to hide more now that I understand how it works. Nice straw. Sorry. I'm a very loud

284
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:17,269
No, but you're okay. No, you're good. It's a straw. Is there a problem with straws?

285
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:28,099
Buddy, why is your steam profile picture alone in the dark? I don't know. I haven't changed it since like

286
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,019
2013 or something. I don't know. Okay. This is important

287
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:42,860
Remotely charge up objects looks like a ghost charging up. I'm gonna try that. Are we playing this game?

288
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:50,599
Are we backing out? Yeah, we're doing this one. Yeah when it changes to the next map all ghosts

289
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:58,280
But then I'll make a new server random sound I found the ability that lets you create false radar readings. That'll be good

290
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,920
That's probably what was happening with us that whole time

291
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,800
Yeah

292
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Apparently you can throw your voice

293
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,179
All you have to do is aim hold left shift and press C and talk

294
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:15,329
So like somebody's throw my voice like she says tell me if you can hear me in proximity

295
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:21,119
Okay, I did

296
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,960
Something really small. Yeah, I'm really far away from you. I just threw my voice to you. Yes. Oh, that's cool

297
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,750
I think I'm gonna go sit. I think I'm gonna go sit in one of those chairs

298
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:47,340
You do that. They'll never know if we find more buckets we can put them in chairs. This is too obvious

299
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:53,280
I don't think they're gonna look over here. Who's the piano? Can you just jump?

300
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:10,599
Yeah, you can fuck do your piano the Mario 64 piano I need to lean forward like the other ones are

301
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:19,280
That was probably a terrible idea. I don't know. I did that scan occasion. I didn't get it. I got the defense

302
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,099
Oh, no, did not about the scanner. No

303
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,460
They didn't get the scanner

304
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
They're far away I'm gonna go this way

305
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,719
I mean ghost hunters. I'm a ghost, of course. I'm gonna go this way

306
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:57,179
Something so humorous about German Tokyo drifting through the door there

307
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:28,280
Chair, oh man, okay. I get I can fake them out

308
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:43,340
Stop moving. I have to look at the ectoplasm buildup. I have to move I can revive

309
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:54,590
They're teabagging my shards

310
00:38:54,829 --> 00:39:06,829
They're all in the first floor. Nope. There's one up top basically. Oh, yeah one just walked by Vinny

311
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,590
Oh

312
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,079
I'm watching this from up here

313
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:38,820
I'm trying to clear the buildup. Wow. Wow. I cannot believe that just happened. What happened? Oh, I just missed it

314
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:44,219
Why would there be a ladder here? It was already looking for Vinny and Vinny just kind of booked it over the balcony

315
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:50,019
Oh great. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I had like a gamer moment. I can't believe it. Well, not that kind of one

316
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:53,059
But I'm gonna save that for you so you can get a third-person perspective

317
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:59,989
Do you guys remember Iced for GameCube I do remember Geist that's what this is multiplayer Geist

318
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,880
It was on what happened recently Geist. Oh

319
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:17,300
Great show and yeah, I haven't been able to forget about it since playing this. Yeah. Oh man that game was okay

320
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,460
The very okay is game

321
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:33,409
I'm like a trampoline

322
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:39,650
I don't understand. It's too stressful. It's too stressful

323
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:09,679
I can't do it. I can't fucking do this. That's too stressful. This is too stressful. It's I'll I can't it's too stressed

324
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,760
I'm gonna lose it. Nice, you know, I don't I don't get it. I don't it's like I freak out

325
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:23,019
I think they can see me at all fucking sides. I think it's like too stressful

326
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:29,980
Yes, Vinny keep distracting. Oh, I don't know. I feel like they can see me

327
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:38,659
I'm just gonna keep jumping as a cat. Are you lying bagging my ghost corpse?

328
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:51,889
I think they'll laugh. So I think they lagged out now. Are they lagging or just tea bagging aggressively?

329
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,650
It's time

330
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:18,500
I'm a couch. It's time for you to pay

331
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:23,110
Yeah, I probably I should I shouldn't like

332
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:29,949
Yeeted myself down the stairs, but I don't know. I love to play these games. I don't know what like what it looks like

333
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:56,340
Fuck no

334
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,340
I'm trying I'm trying to hit him

335
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:01,420
We can if you yeah. Yeah, there you go

336
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:26,460
Good just various objects. Yeah like that. Good job. Oh

337
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:51,849
Come here

338
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:55,820
I

339
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:59,690
Almost got it. I'm trying

340
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:09,039
Ghosts if you want more speed you have to possess an object and right-click hold it and then you can like start

341
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,119
What are you doing?

342
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,280
Did you just like suck the ectoplasm out of that corpse? Yes

343
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:22,280
That's normal

344
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,539
Got it. I wish I would have seen that kill. Yeah

345
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,289
Yeah

346
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:34,889
Team chair, all right

347
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:42,010
Let's see how well you do teams with 12 minutes in a game in a genre that you've never played before

348
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:48,570
In a space that you've never been in before in a area that you've never seen before

349
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:55,269
You understand that I'm trying. Okay, relax. Relax. Everything's fine

350
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:15,599
Use a fee. No, I'm just kidding. I don't know. I never played prop on ever

351
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,210
I know this has been around for like alright, this is like I've never played a game

352
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:34,420
This is like never playing a game of Call of Duty in your whole life. Hey, I just I just solidified that game right there

353
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:44,710
I got the last kill. I think I did pretty good

354
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:52,179
Never played TF2 pro. No, I was always like a super contrarian and

355
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:57,059
Didn't want to play prop on because it was so popular that I was like, nah, it's not me. I'm not playing that

356
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:13,119
It's a popular thing I got a new code I was very much aware of his existence

357
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:20,579
You're a hipster. Yeah, you say that that's fine

358
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:31,949
You're in your right to say that is the guy who played Elden Ring 15 times in a row

359
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:40,960
What does that have to do with anything? Wait, I think maybe I did I play you a video of TF2 prop hunt. I'm pretty sure

360
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:51,900
Yeah, but like I don't it was like that was like eight years ago. I played it once I

361
00:46:53,690 --> 00:47:00,010
Yeah, sorry, I forgot that I played TF2 prop hunt like nine years ago one time

362
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:04,070
What do you say?

363
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,469
How am I supposed? I don't know. I don't remember

364
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:17,539
You tell me what you had for breakfast two weeks ago. I bet you would you ever okay?

365
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,539
What did you have for breakfast on?

366
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:22,139
April 2nd

367
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:29,619
2022 what did you eat for breakfast? Do you fucking even know? No, you can

368
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:37,599
Dude, it was nine like eight or nine years ago, and I probably dude. It was I probably forgot it immediately after it happened

369
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,980
That's so funny, but what's a different game? This is completely different

370
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:48,949
Who knew how team can you hear me?

371
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,460
Are we on the same piece?

372
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:59,059
Yeah, it looks like only one person difference. We just we have Jolly now. We traded for Jolly

373
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,889
No, it's really not

374
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:08,170
It's weird because seriously, I can't find a way to randomize or change teams

375
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:11,010
Between people it seems like that just isn't an option

376
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:22,989
Hey, what did you guys have for breakfast nine years ago nine years ago to the day bacon egg and cheese almost guaranteed guaranteed

377
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,780
almost

378
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,380
Currently going back and forth with chat about a few things

379
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,619
Okay, sorry that took me off guard

380
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:49,199
Probably honey nut Cheerios, I mean lately this not that this is in any way relevant to the question that Jerma had asked

381
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,789
but lately

382
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:57,389
It's been bagel Vinny just shot Jerma's bit to bits. Did I ruin your bit Jerma? No ever?

383
00:48:57,389 --> 00:49:02,429
Okay, so everyone's everyone's yelling at me over here because they're like, how do you not know how to play prop hunt?

384
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:08,110
And I was like, dude, I've never played prop on right somebody pulled out. We watch somebody pulled out an old video from like

385
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:10,969
2013 I was gonna say

386
00:49:11,469 --> 00:49:15,730
Yeah, I don't know. I don't think they did laying. I don't remember playing prop hunt

387
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,210
So I'm like, what'd you have for breakfast two weeks ago on April 2nd?

388
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:24,400
Also crying bit if you play game

389
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:34,380
Wait the match already started he saw it he saw it

390
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,039
Does anyone have a vacuum? Yeah

391
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,940
So all me I just randomly shot a duck, okay guys

392
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:53,539
I just randomly shot that duck because I thought it would be funny and it was cracking dude shoot fucking everything

393
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,340
There's no downside wrecking. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, there isn't

394
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:04,400
Which makes no sense because usually there's like a risk reward

395
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,320
Yeah

396
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,400
Breakfast nine years ago and suddenly criken is dead. I feel a chill

397
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,699
We've got a ghost here where I am

398
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:19,059
What do you guys have you guys played like a game like that? You don't remember playing from like ten years ago

399
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,150
Do you know what I played last night?

400
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:25,510
Thank you. Wait, what do you found him?

401
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,230
Treasure chest

402
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:34,449
Like that you don't remember playing ten years ago, but you have played it. Yeah, we're saying oh

403
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:39,630
Probably any Call of Duty game from then you know how many steam games

404
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:43,630
I probably have downloaded that that I've played like maybe 30 minutes of and went well

405
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:50,690
I don't this game sucks and then never played it again and forgot. I ever bought it guys criken is haunting me

406
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:54,800
Hmm. It's probably because you shot a duck

407
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,510
Sorry, criken. I thought it would be funny to shoot the duck. I'm sorry. How is this happening?

408
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:06,409
And this is well, because I'm just looking for objects that are slightly out of place

409
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:12,059
I'm playing the video game, you know in a reading

410
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:15,840
That's a lot. I didn't mean that to sound so sassy. I apologize

411
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:23,099
Dare you not talk about breakfast that you ate something right here. Look man. All I'm saying is

412
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:25,590
Well Germans getting a lot of shit for this

413
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:31,949
I literally have played mods that I've got that I played like two months. I feel like them again

414
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:39,619
I don't know that doesn't make your shit inexcusable jammer. Come on. I mean, I've played a mod of

415
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:44,900
I played prop hunt nine years ago, and I don't remember playing it

416
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:52,780
How do you but do you not remember the craze on YouTube where oh, yeah, really? Everybody played it. Oh, absolutely

417
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,780
I just don't remember being a part of the craze

418
00:51:55,139 --> 00:52:00,139
But like surely, you know a bit of this from osmosis like absolutely

419
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:08,610
To be fair though this this is this is a lot a little more prop hunty than usual prop hunt

420
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:16,039
It's actually not not to correct you but it's less prop hunt than prop hunt. Okay

421
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:32,289
There's nothing in the boat, okay, there's nothing I just I love that he's literally being a pirate in the boat

422
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:34,769
He was taunting me before

423
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:40,280
Now are there skeleton ghosts? Are we doing squid ghosts? What do we got?

424
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,659
I just watched what's the Caribbean?

425
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:48,090
squid ghosts

426
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:59,039
Watch the first two why can't squids have ghosts Charlie? What is this? Well, I mean they can but I don't think they'd be particularly cerebral I

427
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:05,929
Don't think there's much going on in a squid bat brain other than eat food eat food shit eat food eat

428
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:10,530
They're very smart. They're very smart animals cephalopods man mental. I

429
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,070
Thought that was octopuses. I don't know any better

430
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:21,510
Don't make me feel guilty for eating squid. I love just making stuff up it. Yep. So am I but

431
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:29,619
You know, he's chilling any readings at all down here somebody something down here. I found him. I found a piece of box. Oh

432
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:32,139
shit, okay, oh

433
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,500
Yeah, he's something else. He's literally in this room

434
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:40,860
The salt water is corroding your suit

435
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,619
What?

436
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,619
Where the fuck is he?

437
00:53:44,739 --> 00:53:48,400
He's has to be right here somewhere like literally right here

438
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:57,500
Yeah, we got strong readings down here. All right, we're about to get fucked. So stick together run

439
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:13,230
He just fucking murdered him. Oh my god. Oh, he's so low. I'm knocked out

440
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:22,829
Squids are able to count solve problems recognize patterns and communicate

441
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,639
Dude squids can play video games

442
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:35,969
You think squids got kind of fell out of an alien spaceship driving across the earth and fell in the ocean

443
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:37,849
Just kind of kept going. I

444
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:41,940
Mean that that sounds like a good enough theory for me

445
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,260
being

446
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,260
non biology

447
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,900
Fuck oh, that's all of my health. I have six

448
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:59,820
You're so low, but I have faith you got this dude. I believe in you. No, just just just yeah, buddy

449
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,820
So how was Pirates of the Caribbean one in two?

450
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,780
Very good, and I will tell you this to comfort you as you die

451
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,860
But I will say that I like to maybe a little bit better than one

452
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:17,539
Really? Maybe a little bit just because I like the squids. They were pretty cool incredibly incredibly relevant point

453
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:20,539
I've seen all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. I don't remember any of them

454
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:28,750
Okay, I'm cursed the black pearl is kind of a classic to me, but I

455
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:33,349
Thought dead man's chest was a little too long for its own good. I

456
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:39,469
Just got called out for having shit taste for liking the sequel like a little bit better than the first one

457
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:45,269
You I mean you could look at it like that. I mean, I mean you could Vinnie, but you're wrong. I

458
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,829
You know incorrect opinions are basically what I live for

459
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:56,750
There are four parts of the Caribbean movies, right? Oh shit. I'm about to fire like seven

460
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,239
That range was so all over the place. Oh, no, there are seven. No, there are five there are four

461
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,210
That feels like there are seven

462
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:14,289
Attention off to the third

463
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:20,519
That's what I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna watch the third one. I'm just gonna stop

464
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,059
Yeah, that was the last one that for Binsky

465
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:29,599
Directed then he went to do a Rango if you haven't seen that as a great movie. I've heard about that one. It's animated movie

466
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:37,079
Yeah, I didn't I think I've only seen two. I don't actually won the Oscar. There's so much fucking media nowadays like this so much

467
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:42,260
There's not there's only so much as one thing in our brains to be able to remember all this fucking media

468
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,940
Think of all the video games all the movies all the breakfasts you've had

469
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:54,840
Gemma, I just want to say I'm going from agreeing with you to maybe he has early onset Alzheimer's really real quick here

470
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:58,699
That's usually me

471
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:04,909
Like who remembers what they ate for breakfast who remembers what they did yesterday. I don't remember what I was playing yesterday

472
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,789
Who remembers movie? I don't remember movies

473
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:14,309
Yeah, but I mean, okay. I remember what I did yesterday, but not like eight years ago

474
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:19,630
Surviving their cheese. I was so I was one minute away

475
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:24,110
I've played so much Eldon ring in the past like I

476
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:33,780
Wanted to hear his take I wanted to hear the Eldon ring take you're getting I'm getting eviscerated, right?

477
00:57:34,539 --> 00:57:41,110
Okay, I want to try it that good again

478
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:47,780
Yeah, I'm gonna try that point again is I've been playing so much Eldon ring that there's a good chance in a year

479
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,659
I'm not gonna remember more than the fact there were some dudes that look like foreskin

480
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:59,670
I've got that it's it's it's a huge game. There's so much to see it's just so much. There's just too much I

481
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:05,190
Can't wait for like two years from now when everybody decides to replay it at the exact same time

482
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:08,639
Yeah, what DLC you mean?

483
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:21,789
Yeah, pretty much so even though we're not playing Eldon ring right now, but any what are your builds? What's everybody's builds?

484
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,690
What did they run through the game? I've been doing a bunch of different things

485
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,969
But I do a little bit of int magic and mostly decks and like so I'm using

486
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,130
I

487
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:38,719
Do play blades based but bested this guy's bested for his build

488
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,690
All right, we just we're just gonna try all sitting in the exact same spot, huh? Oh, we're all here

489
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:52,599
Oh, yeah work good plan. No, I'm not over here. Yeah, I got a good spot. It's actually really good

490
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:56,659
Cuz I'm gonna corrupt these these crates

491
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:11,929
What does that do? I mean it crops them. I guess I got a really good plan here. So I'm just shaking off the ectoplasm

492
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:33,179
The good call I forgot about that you can press B to ding apparently the ding you can yeah, you can I think we I

493
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:50,519
Wonder if the enemy team can hear that and it like stops ectoplasm build up. Oh, that's cool. Yes

494
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:57,619
Remember to throw your voice that shift and then

495
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,210
Yeah

496
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:10,630
By the way, they can totally hear you going

497
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,550
As you're jumping up and down. Oh

498
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:22,329
Aided that does make noise. I will just have to be light-footed then. I mean, I'm a I'm a treasure chest, but

499
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:31,199
It'll work. Just ding ring the bell smash the link

500
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,079
subscribe

501
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,960
If you do 25 taunts in one game you get an achievement right here right here

502
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:03,980
My team I see him. Oh, yeah

503
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,420
Bouncing a crate. Oh, I can't go that way

504
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:10,880
Run German German was the one that ended up getting chased first

505
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:14,420
Yeah, and we're being complete assholes and dingy

506
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,380
Good harpoon. Yeah, now we got him

507
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,900
lads here the oh

508
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,420
Yeah, what button is that?

509
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:48,829
What would you would you press? I left my mark and so did Kurt Cobain

510
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:52,150
I wish I could how do I I don't want to certainly did

511
01:01:53,969 --> 01:02:01,230
Here's I lost him by the way. Oh nice. Here's the problem with putting your spray paint paint down is that

512
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:10,590
It's not it's not prop. It's not prop what it's not proper because it's not like work

513
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:15,260
You know, we're giving away that we're props. You know what? Yes. Yes

514
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:22,570
Dinging in the jumping before which was totally inconspicuous. I think yeah, I think that was alright

515
01:02:22,969 --> 01:02:25,659
I'm back. I just had to place my spray over there

516
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:33,420
Let me spray on the wall walk in the fucking door. By the way, hold on big brain move. Oh, no little brain move

517
01:02:34,139 --> 01:03:08,960
spot

518
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:20,449
Why am I still alive?

519
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:23,300
You've been digging

520
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:29,070
Very well. Did you like my dings? It's a good round good round

521
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:38,500
I don't know how to respond to that. This is a really good round so far. Yeah

522
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,340
surprisingly good like I

523
01:03:45,369 --> 01:03:52,010
Want to say it's not us it's them because I'm currently dinging repeatedly and the spray is right behind my head

524
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,090
They just don't seem to care nice

525
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:59,469
There they did there if they die, they probably had it coming

526
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:08,880
Kind of heartless, but correct. Why am I dying? What's going on?

527
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:16,010
already dead the

528
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:24,000
The seeing the hunters through the walls perk is fucking broke as shit. Where are they? I

529
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:32,829
Didn't know that was a perk. I thought that was a passive for everybody. Yeah, that that perk is in a book

530
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:41,610
We got a location on them. They're all hiding behind the at the back of the ship here the this part

531
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,050
Third

532
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,050
That also the I killed one

533
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:59,340
nice job

534
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:04,260
Salt damages ghosts. Yeah, that's some

535
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:09,380
Some I guess the boat phasmophobia. I

536
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:33,420
Don't see anyone in the boat, but on me back me the boat. We need a pence of them. Yep. Found one found one

537
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:39,949
Go to a gas can German German gas can get him. Oh damn German

538
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:50,010
Hold on damn dude. That was next round savage brain that consume its work

539
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,889
Only one left

540
01:05:55,889 --> 01:06:03,920
So it just kind of becomes reverse hide-and-seek at the ends it kind of does yeah

541
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,880
Who's left is a crank? Yeah

542
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,969
criken

543
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:18,590
Where are you?

544
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:30,150
Probably like crouching behind something over here. I'm definitely getting that perk. Let's see through all as one

545
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:33,909
It's very he's on the top of the ship everybody

546
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:38,969
He's like I'm one of the masts. Oh my god. If I just looked up I would have seen him fucking hell

547
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:46,980
I'm an idiot. I almost made it demand your blood

548
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,809
Ouch still up top. Nope right here

549
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:06,260
Nice job. Good. Good. Good. Good game. This is souped-up prop on kind of is yeah

550
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,489
Box do you want to change up teams ready? We're gonna keep going

551
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:16,030
What do you think? I don't know. It's up to you guys

552
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:24,369
You want to shuffle again, I think it's it depends on who gets in first is the

553
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,250
First team I think

554
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:30,099
Okay, so let's shuffle. I'll exit this

555
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:41,090
Okay, that's fun. That's cool. That was your best game yet. Yeah, I mean I'm starting to figure it out

556
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:48,969
I definitely want that see people through Wallace thing cuz that's ridiculous. I'll put it on

557
01:07:48,969 --> 01:08:02,610
I like to smash it into people you can throw your voice with shift plus C

558
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:09,510
Is that a perk or can I just can I just do that? It looks sweaty. I don't think so

559
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:20,949
I'm a little flush for some reason. I don't know why let's get in I

560
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:34,699
Want to take a good look at those perks kind of like the huntsman it kind of is yeah

561
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:39,750
Alright, let's do some loadout stuff

562
01:08:39,789 --> 01:08:44,649
Alright ghost loadout this one here

563
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:49,899
See hunters through walls. Okay, I can I can unlock it. I definitely want that

564
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:55,350
Even before midnight that seems like why would you pick anything else?

565
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:04,090
Telekinesis is so good. I was able to live through that whole thing. I tricked the whole team for like a full minute

566
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,439
deadly

567
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:11,850
ghostly mist

568
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:17,100
Corruptor that's not bad either

569
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:33,750
Someone's a fake ghost. Oh shit. I didn't get to look. I don't know about these though

570
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:39,229
Flamethrower I mean hi Kraken. We're finally on the same team, which is nice

571
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:45,380
Oh, I don't know. I wish it was easier to like customize the teams. But

572
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:51,319
anyway, sorry about the duck incident incident

573
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,430
Apologize to me man. I would have done the same. I

574
01:09:56,430 --> 01:10:00,189
Saw a duck I got excited man. I don't know. I just sometimes I

575
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:04,909
That was where the duck spawned though. Like I didn't even move it. I was like, this is perfect

576
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:07,350
He just fucking shot me immediately just went right in

577
01:10:08,029 --> 01:10:15,520
Is the sniper any good? I probably not. Oh

578
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:23,970
You know, you know snipe a fucking box, man. That's true. They like make new songs for

579
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:27,289
like this game

580
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:31,640
Or did they like go to?

581
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,939
Yeah, is it is it new songs zero this might be a new song. Yeah, I haven't heard this one before must be new

582
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:48,779
This is a good one. Do you like it? It's our solo is fantastic

583
01:10:49,779 --> 01:11:00,119
It's very very generic David Gilmore Pink Floyd waterlands music. It seems like adequate small talk on the way to a haunted mansion

584
01:11:01,659 --> 01:11:08,329
We've been to this one yet. No. Oh, yeah. We have I think we you know what we did a practice

585
01:11:09,729 --> 01:11:12,529
What?

586
01:11:13,489 --> 01:11:15,789
What happened

587
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,210
sensitivity is way too high

588
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:37,470
Ghosts just hanging out in this it's better if you guys see a ghost, you know, I got a ghost

589
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:42,869
Where did I move that with my body? It's probably a glizzy. Yeah. Okay. All right. Hear me. I

590
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:47,670
Hate the word glizzy, but I can't stop saying it someone glizzy someone just dinged

591
01:11:48,829 --> 01:11:51,050
What's the definition of the glizzy? Hello? It's Ross

592
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:57,289
A glizzy is apparently slang for a hot dog and I have no idea why this happened

593
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:59,770
Is that a New York thing or I

594
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,520
Think it was in I've explained this and this has come up on my stream like five days in a row

595
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:11,880
Like five streams in a row, but it apparently started as slang for a Glock in prison in like Florida

596
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,880
And then somehow it became slang for a hot dog

597
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:20,930
Really?

598
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:23,289
Down in the dining room. I'm getting some activity

599
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:38,250
Yeah, yeah table it's I lost it I'll check it up check this chair

600
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:44,479
My god, I got a chair

601
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
It was the chair. I

602
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:49,039
3c4

603
01:12:50,439 --> 01:13:00,029
Nice why we were all at the boards because I got soft one. Oh really? Oh man. Oh, that's not

604
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:16,649
I thought you guys were just hanging out there. We were trying to get somebody's dingin in here redo or

605
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,050
That other ability

606
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:34,329
Does the ding mean all right, can they be painting the ghost of Hector Salamanca is haunting us. Where are you Hector?

607
01:13:35,489 --> 01:13:47,050
Yeah, that ding was literally in my head

608
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,439
No, they're not upstairs. They're not upstairs. They're not upstairs

609
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:27,720
No, they're not they're not downstairs. They're not downstairs. Okay, I swear to God somebody is in this room

610
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:31,439
You know if you can be door

611
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,920
We're gonna look real foolish once we figure out where this person is

612
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:47,189
In the fire. I didn't bring my ghost detecting instrument. I should get that. I think something was just in front of me

613
01:14:47,710 --> 01:15:03,680
Did I miss it? It's just where the fuck is this person?

614
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:11,619
I'm getting a candle. There's a candle on the table. There's a candle

615
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:26,229
Candles it was a candle on the table. Oh, I don't know where they went. I know I don't know. I have no idea. I don't

616
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,840
Oh

617
01:15:45,989 --> 01:15:55,590
Just spray everywhere

618
01:15:57,069 --> 01:16:00,289
Where was he he had several things

619
01:16:01,489 --> 01:16:06,970
He was a candle on the dining room table. I was sitting on the table. It turned it

620
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:13,239
He was like table with sheet on it. Yeah, I was on the table

621
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:19,439
Myself yeah two seconds and then I realized yeah, two of those kills were just because you're in the lobby stuck

622
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:21,439
I don't know. How do we not?

623
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:28,420
Randomly spray you or hit you when you were on the table. It was hilarious. Honestly, I was watching you just walk over him

624
01:16:28,939 --> 01:16:30,500
That's crazy

625
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:36,260
All right leveled up. I want to unlock new skin. So I don't look like

626
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:41,250
Candle was body blocking you

627
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:47,149
Have you seen arcane? What are your thoughts on the show? I think it's on the first episode

628
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:53,369
The only thing I remember from arcane was oh

629
01:16:55,029 --> 01:16:56,949
the misery

630
01:16:56,949 --> 01:16:58,949
Every single person is my enemy

631
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:02,600
That's all it's the only thing I know. I don't know anything else

632
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,710
And the song goes oh

633
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:18,170
Imagine dragons that they they have that formula down. They have that

634
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:25,680
Salt circle blocks your pet. Oh

635
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:26,899
That's good

636
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:37,250
And dude, by the way when that song comes on when I saw that intro like a warmth raises over my body

637
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,810
Like I'm like, it's like it's not chills, but it's like a yes. Here we go. I

638
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:58,369
Don't like this spot at all. By the way, I can what are you? You're the door

639
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:34,220
I've even moved the thing. Oh what I even moved. Ah, whatever skill issue. I was too busy like doing like

640
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:49,060
My enemies I'm

641
01:18:49,779 --> 01:18:51,300
Radioactive

642
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,539
Radioactive every single person is my enemy

643
01:18:55,220 --> 01:19:14,250
What's that stop? I have imagined dragons on right now

644
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:23,539
Well, I don't care. I'm not one of those banned elitist, right? I'm not gonna be like well, I

645
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:29,729
Have this indie band that I listen to that's better. I don't I don't care if you enjoy music good

646
01:19:29,729 --> 01:19:34,760
I hope you do. I don't I don't listen to music. I don't really listen to it too much

647
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:40,640
I listen to like the guerrillas albums on repeat the Lost Odyssey soundtrack on repeat

648
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:46,270
Full metal alchemist intro and outro brotherhood

649
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,010
Maybe like a dozen times a week

650
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:57,500
I used to be able to recite the entire attack on Titan season 2 intro until I was like I probably should stop doing this

651
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:20,279
Cuz the YouTube algorithms gonna like I think I'm like a fucking weirdo. What was that sound? I cannot hear him

652
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:29,100
Are you making fun of imagine dragons? I just told you I didn't I'm just saying like that. Those are the two songs

653
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:36,590
I know I thought I didn't make I just said that music if you have different music tastes. There's nothing wrong with it

654
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:43,960
I don't care. Okay, I feel to say people used to give me shit about liking the Venom movie. Okay, look

655
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,489
I you know, I do let me tell you something about why the Venom movie

656
01:20:47,489 --> 01:20:50,930
I don't I don't care if you don't like the Venom it's working cracking. I thought it was funny

657
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:55,130
I thought it was just like absurd. It was awful, but it was great at the same time. Who cares

658
01:20:55,289 --> 01:21:11,430
Who doesn't matter?

659
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:16,630
Nowhere in that whole thing. Did I say I hate him? We're gonna avoid the clip

660
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,880
Nowhere during that entire segment. Did I say the words?

661
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:31,460
I never said this hate never said this imagine dragons never said it. All I said was I just I didn't say anything

662
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,739
I just went oh

663
01:21:32,739 --> 01:21:34,739
I'm not gonna say it again

664
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:44,279
Oh

665
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:54,729
I'm not kidding man. I really thought something's wrong with my computer. I thought something was wrong

666
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:15,310
I thought there's something in this drink. I was like what happened? What did I just take?

667
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:22,279
It's like why the drugs in my drink what's going on I was like what the fuck

668
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,600
Feels like the screen is wavy too. I'm just like, what's it the macho?

669
01:22:33,479 --> 01:22:41,560
All right, that is the most annoying fucking too much matcha powder I

670
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,680
Really think I'm gonna select it next time

671
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,079
It's like this side of it mother matcha powder

672
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:57,199
you know

673
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:03,039
The ghost hunt was really about the friends we made I died it wasn't so much about the actual ghost hunting

674
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:07,970
I was I was gone on the first probably five seconds

675
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:56,310
This thing's too big I'd like to dub this genre of game prop hunt with consequences. Oh

676
01:23:57,149 --> 01:24:28,720
Shit I just bumped into you shit. Oh fuck. I was hoping Tony and physics would win out. I just kept missing

677
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:32,680
How do you even die in this we can get killed in the ghost?

678
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:37,840
Oh, I was bumping into stuff on that room was a bad place to do that should have left and on that map of all maps

679
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:46,340
We got consequenced. Yeah, I feel you guys should have had a real advantage to that true life consequences. I

680
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:52,010
Slammed into so yeah to ghosts. We smashed into it. It was too

681
01:24:52,489 --> 01:24:57,289
Hey, I'm like these spooky ghost perk. That's just there to fuck with the other team. I

682
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,430
Just was trying to be annoying. I hope it worked

683
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:05,250
It oh trust me it worked. I it was soothing. I went to I went to

684
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:08,250
policing the attack on Titan intro

685
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:14,239
Now you're really gonna get like are you kidding me? I?

686
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:19,939
know

687
01:25:19,939 --> 01:25:21,930
No way

688
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:24,909
No way not a chance in hell. No way

689
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:34,359
Hey, you like my outfit. Oh, it's a new that's how much does it cost?

690
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:40,989
1500 it costs you your soul because you have to cook meth and albuquerque to get it. Oh

691
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:46,189
That is a that is a Jesse out for you, right a little bit

692
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:54,829

693
01:25:54,829 --> 01:25:57,710

I was play here. We got it. We want to strategize a little bit. We do two and two

695
01:26:05,149 --> 01:26:09,140
Two and two and I think the high road

Okay, I'll take the the criken road because I want to atone for my killing of the duck

This is this level is really good for for ghosts. There's a lot of room. Fuck. I don't know in life

730
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,979
Were you an animator?

731
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:47,020
Good night. I'm gonna stay perched

732
01:31:47,539 --> 01:32:05,279
Fuck. Oh my god. We lost what? Wow. What? Oh

733
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:10,529
I was a statue in the basement that you guys walked

734
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:17,670
I knew it. I knew it. I knew is in the basement. It's good. Yeah, you were in on that. This is dog

735
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:24,130
I love the egg dog so much dog shit. Thank you fucking weapon is absolute dog shit

736
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:26,970
Seven damage that how do you do?

737
01:32:27,489 --> 01:32:31,529
The tag I saw on the ground weapons dog shit. I'm just you great

738
01:32:32,529 --> 01:32:39,359
Okay, and it just is your twitch avatar right thing. I'm a twitch. I hear your steam

739
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:46,590
Yeah, yes a bad craftsman blames the tools a bad craftsman blames a seven damage sniper

740
01:32:47,069 --> 01:32:57,319
when the exploding splash damage the five per clip bomb weapon does like 30 all of them

741
01:33:01,859 --> 01:33:17,699
Isary I won't do this. I think fly cuz you can fly that's yeah under that. All right. That was that was a good round

742
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:33,130
But let's go for it. There's some really good ghost skins like they're expensive as fuck, but there's some really fun ones

743
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:35,229
I gotta look at them. I like the

744
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:44,399
Grim Reaper one. I think I'm gonna be that one's cool. I just like the classic ghost with sheet America statue

745
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,989
Should I do door again? Or is that uh?

746
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:55,079
No way. It works twice. I think it will work again. Yeah, it's just

747
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:03,810
When the right mind would be a door for five minutes the person who likes the most fun gameplay

748
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:06,510
I like my spot

749
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:13,279
Also criken I saw you streaming something the other day where like chat was

750
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:18,239
Participating and they were like little avat like avatars and stuff. Yeah, what was that?

751
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:29,090
Cuckaroo was it good. Yeah, it's pretty fun. It's like it only uses your chat for interaction

752
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:35,050
So it kind of spams up the whole thing, but oh, they're gonna run Vinny. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no

753
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,199
Vinny's doing the duck

754
01:34:47,000 --> 01:35:04,930
Self-report self-report. I'm beginning to I'm beginning to think I'm bad at this game. Can I talk or were they hear me?

755
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:12,529
You're good. If you press Q. Yeah, I

756
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:22,979
Do you do you see my 100 million IQ spot here? I'm gonna take a look guys

757
01:35:22,979 --> 01:35:25,340
I accidentally sprayed my spray and right next to my door

758
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:31,739
Very that's cool. If they see it, it's a very clear giveaway

759
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,020
I'm the door

760
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:40,850
Just the door. I literally okay that put my own face on the door. That's a good spot

761
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:55,279
That's a good spot and it's stretched criken like a cross. It's really cool

762
01:35:55,279 --> 01:36:03,619
Look, he sees it. There's no way they find me. Is he gonna this is riveting gameplay?

763
01:36:03,619 --> 01:36:09,020
This is called winning gameplay because there's no fucking way anyone's gonna come over here. Like why would you come over here?

764
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:22,590
They really not you know, they didn't they just went okay the door I really hope none of them try to call my god

765
01:36:23,229 --> 01:36:30,310
Good up to do that. Let's all right. We're good. Long time fan want to tell you that your title sucks

766
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:43,539
I don't know what the title is

767
01:36:43,579 --> 01:36:45,579
I'm dangin

768
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:55,699
Here you do well you should have

769
01:36:57,619 --> 01:37:02,739
They're never gonna find me no way

770
01:37:02,979 --> 01:37:20,739
No fucking way. This is the best spot of the whole day. I think I can move a little

771
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:23,140
Clear the build up

772
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:29,539
my fucking god there

773
01:37:29,779 --> 01:38:10,829
There's no way. No, this is no fucking way. They're gonna come over. I am in the clear. I am never going to be found

774
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:27,300
But wait, that means I have to kill everybody throw your voice. It was shift C should hold shift and press C

775
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:45,600
That work

776
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,560
Oh

777
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:41,510
Is that all right, all right, all right, all right, all right up I oh I fucked up I fucked up

778
01:39:41,630 --> 01:40:15,930
This reminds me of bugs life when the ants stand up to the grasshoppers. It's like we're not as big a threat as they thought

779
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:25,470
Haven't thought of that in a very long time. The shotguns insane. We're still hiding from them down

780
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:31,699
Go gas can gas can you got this?

781
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:44,829
No, what?

782
01:40:44,829 --> 01:40:47,460
No

783
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:50,140
How the heck is he flying like that?

784
01:40:56,020 --> 01:41:03,449
My god. Holy shit. What a magnificent last stand. Yeah, I was trying to I

785
01:41:04,609 --> 01:41:09,710
Was holding the button down. I felt kind of bad for him. I I was holding right click

786
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:13,229
I know you could throw your body at him hit him the fucking head. I do I couldn't hit him the fucking head though

787
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:19,380
No, you can like slash it people if you didn't know. Oh, it kills almost instantly

788
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:24,689
Does it really

789
01:41:24,689 --> 01:41:30,250
I was trying that too, and I was not doing enough damage. I did 98 damage to me in one hit

790
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:38,840
I'm trying to hit him in the fucking head. I know you can fucking hit him in the fucking head

791
01:41:39,319 --> 01:42:00,140
All right. Now that I know okay now that I know that I could do it. Give me this goddamn thing

792
01:42:00,699 --> 01:42:05,319
So guys, how are you doing that?

793
01:42:06,039 --> 01:42:09,899
local training

794
01:42:09,899 --> 01:42:14,109
That's just what I could do that by a fucking sledgehammer

795
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:23,810
Secret vocal technique, I guess we'll do these teams

796
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:26,489
I'm sorry

797
01:42:26,489 --> 01:42:29,229
Someone on my chat. Just said Vinnie annoys his friends all night

798
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:34,060
I don't think it's annoying. I think it's cool. I think you're great, man. I

799
01:42:34,579 --> 01:42:37,399
Do frostbite this I?

800
01:42:38,609 --> 01:42:41,569
Think that's great, too. You know, in fact, we're going to prom right now

801
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:45,260
That's pretty touching

802
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:47,539
Yeah, I think we're all each other's dates

803
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:52,220
All right, cool. Very excited. I'm gonna cook some meth at the prom

804
01:42:52,579 --> 01:42:57,880
You guys can like place on fire. Yeah, you should spike the fruit punch with meth

805
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:04,050
Well, I don't know mr. White, come on Jesse

806
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:18,180
I'm happy I got Jerma to hear I got to hear Jerma do a Walter White impression

807
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:29,859
It's really easy just do Harrison Ford but say Jesse

808
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:35,340
Chewy, I mean Jesse

809
01:43:36,579 --> 01:43:43,050
You got it. That was perfect

810
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:49,100
Think once for yes and none for no

811
01:43:52,180 --> 01:44:06,239
Was moving is your name rubber Ross? All right, never mind. It's not Ross

812
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:12,649
Hulk says

813
01:44:13,329 --> 01:44:15,699
There's somebody in the ballroom area

814
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,859
Okay, what the fuck I don't know

815
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:37,579
Percussion it's like oh like there's someone in the in the dance hall. Oh, he scared me

816
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:55,239
I'm trying to shoot him with the ice pellets. Well, we're all bad at this

817
01:44:55,399 --> 01:44:57,609
I

818
01:44:57,609 --> 01:45:04,340
Got science lab. There is a weird teleporter in here though. Oh, it's a bouncy pad

819
01:45:04,939 --> 01:45:26,739
I'll see him. Yeah, she says your shit. Your shaggy voice is like unreal. Thank you. Here. Let me try one more time

820
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:31,289
Like swing scoop like we're at the prom

821
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:34,149
That's pretty good

822
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:45,260
Scrappy do and get banned. It's probably apologize

823
01:45:48,779 --> 01:45:53,140
Yeah, you get banned from the server and which unfortunately it's in their rules now

824
01:45:53,739 --> 01:45:55,739
Somebody's in here. Somebody's a chair or something. I

825
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:08,029
Think we have a ghost in the punch bowl. Oh, I hope we do

826
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:12,420
That's not the real cry

827
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:15,270
What what no

828
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:24,640
That was fake Kraken. I got to the first layer. Hold on

829
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:38,310
Thankfully, it's right. Oh, no a bomb in the lasagna. I am 100% being a toilet

830
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:44,560
Yeah, that wasn't Kraken that was Kraken. There's no way I'm not gonna be a toilet next room

831
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:51,930
There's no activity here at all zero zero Roger Roger

832
01:46:51,930 --> 01:47:11,020
I mean my icon is Nirvana. So there's a song from Nirvana called school. Anyone know that song? Yeah. Yeah

833
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:14,130
That's this right now. So true

834
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:26,369
Interesting and I get some friends to come out of the stage, please. Oh, no, I couldn't find me squid game. Look an idiot

835
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:34,649
He's gonna be an idiot in squid game. He's a guitar guitar guitar guitar if you're

836
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:49,859
All we're gonna die. Have we tried in here?

837
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:53,380
Dude, I am such a okay. I cannot use this next time

838
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:56,600
I'm just staring at the meter and not looking at what it's pointing at

839
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:12,579
We got a ding and I I don't even trash he was trash it was Liam he was trash

840
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:31,810
Oh my god, Lois, I thought you know

841
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:35,689
Was jolly. Yeah, I just got sucks to

842
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:40,859
Damn it. Are there any weapons that are good besides the first one? I

843
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,260
Haven't found I haven't found one yet

844
01:48:45,539 --> 01:48:48,539
Dang Liam, I thought it was jolly dinging the whole time

845
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:56,270
No, yeah, I was I was a trash can in the hallway. Well, you figured it out. Yeah, he's a shotgun

846
01:48:56,670 --> 01:49:02,810
Yeah, I was and then I was a drum kit before then you walked by me a lot. I think also

847
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:05,819
my

848
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:09,340
Lads for tonight. My goal is for us to see every map at least once

849
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:15,800
So I think we I think we only have one more after this to be fit. Okay, this is probably a bad idea

850
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:18,039
But let's see what happens

851
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:30,289
Whatever people think I'm like a cringy annoying loser. Anyways, I'm going for it. This one's better

852
01:49:30,289 --> 01:49:38,260
I like this actually way more I put shove hunter. Yeah to be fair someone was saying

853
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:42,840
Probably the other team

854
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:46,140
You guys don't all at the same time do a Peter Griffin impression that the kind of three

855
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:51,310
Yeah, let's do it. I think so. I think it's worth it. What are we saying? I'd love to see

856
01:49:51,649 --> 01:49:56,090
Yeah, we're gonna say the same thing too. Yeah the exact same thing. Okay. What is it?

857
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:01,260
This reminds me of the time that I went to the school dance Lois

858
01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:04,350
Yeah, you ready?

859
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:09,369
Yeah, and one two three this reminds me

860
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:21,100
Feel like I'm the weak link there guys, I gotta be honest. I couldn't tell because it was just a cacophony of Peters

861
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:27,930
That's like we all we all so badly wanted to make the same joke and we did it at the same time

862
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:32,159
I mean you told us yeah, but like but that's like it

863
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:38,079
Like out of context though like we all so badly wanted to make the Peter Griffin reference at the school dance

864
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:41,140
And all happen to say the same exact line

865
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:45,899
It's a very memorable quote. We could probably get Ross and his

866
01:50:46,939 --> 01:50:53,619
To no don't be a guitar. That's so obvious animate it fucked. But yeah, I'm sure he would love to do that

867
01:50:54,060 --> 01:51:00,460
Wait, I had not moved. I was too busy focusing on Peter Griffin

868
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:05,140
I'm the mic in the middle of the dance floor. It's not a good place to be

869
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,180
I mean

870
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:13,659
But the but you are an important tool of the dance without you. How would we hear the vocals? Yeah, whenever they come close

871
01:51:13,659 --> 01:51:20,779
I'm gonna say um, Peter Griffin line. Okay. Remember you can throw your voice

872
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:25,300
I'm gonna throw it right behind them. They're gonna turn around and then I'll run

873
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,220
Yeah, how far can you throw it just as far as you can see?

874
01:51:28,819 --> 01:51:33,079
Yeah, it's a little pinpoint when you do it. You hold control and see

875
01:51:33,939 --> 01:51:39,489
So it's control and see what was that cool noise. It's not like Chewbacca

876
01:51:41,329 --> 01:51:46,189
I hate that noise

877
01:52:00,909 --> 01:52:06,220
Fucking scary

878
01:52:15,819 --> 01:52:17,819
What you think of a bowl of Cheetos

879
01:52:36,939 --> 01:53:25,229
Screw damn I'm a big man. Yeah, this is ghost Peter Griffin. Yeah, I'm staying right here you Stewie

880
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:43,729
You're not throwing it shift and see look. I can see it over there. That's what I'm doing the whole time

881
01:53:43,729 --> 01:53:59,159
Look, you can see the indicator just see as I'm doing we're doing the whole time. This is now just spooky family guy

882
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:05,670
I'm over here. I'm over here here here. I'm over here here here

883
01:54:30,659 --> 01:54:54,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

884
01:54:56,850 --> 01:55:00,210
I feel like I have the best hiding spot. Like I haven't seen anybody come over here

885
01:55:01,729 --> 01:55:05,569
They all just like hanging out in the uh, the actual dance hall. No, no, no, no, no

886
01:55:31,409 --> 01:55:33,489
Snake have you ever heard of the diaper chief?

887
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:48,850
I need to live I need to live

888
01:55:51,409 --> 01:56:02,659
Come on you can't come on you fucking consumerists

889
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:14,859
C4

890
01:56:14,859 --> 01:56:17,949
I got insta killed

891
01:56:17,949 --> 01:56:22,140
I got one

892
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:24,380
Uh, it's just me. I forgot you can attack fuck

893
01:56:26,739 --> 01:56:28,739
Why is it consumerists? I don't know

894
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,880
It's crazy to me. You can survive the entire round and then die in one hit

895
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,600
Yeah

896
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:45,039
I gotta I gotta remember to actually attack with right click. I've been trying i've been headshotting people with the furniture

897
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:48,479
I got

898
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:52,640
Yeah, and also in some ways less risky because you're going fast

899
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:01,600
Diaper chief stop it

900
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,859
How do you get that pose?

901
01:57:04,859 --> 01:57:07,300
It's an emote

902
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:09,460
I don't know. It's a it's a victory pose

903
01:57:09,779 --> 01:57:16,979
I don't know almost killed me with the sheer forces and launch. That was pretty cool. Yeah, you had 10 health left, right?

904
01:57:17,859 --> 01:57:22,500
Let us exit the server and do one more map perhaps with one more change of team

905
01:57:22,979 --> 01:57:27,699
All right, should we should we change the join order? Because that seems to be what the uh teams are

906
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:30,819
Yeah, let's try that. We can organize it we can like decide who goes

907
01:57:30,819 --> 01:57:33,600
What?

908
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:37,340
consumerist

909
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:40,619
I don't know. We're like in all these objects like basketballs and like

910
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:44,619
Like keyboards and like computers. I don't know

911
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:50,079
I figured it'd be like what the fuck is he talking about? Like they're running around chasing this ghost who is a chair

912
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:52,640
And he's like you fucking consumerist. It's like

913
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:56,270
What are you talking about? What does that have to do with anything?

914
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,560
You're an object

915
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,560
Yeah, I know i'm like a piano

916
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,810
He's so high

917
01:58:14,050 --> 01:58:27,470
You keep talking in team chat

918
01:58:27,470 --> 01:58:30,029
Oh, that was the time that I played golf

919
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:37,060
This is fun. This is fun

920
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:41,060
Yeah, I was throwing my voice. I was throwing it all I that that was a really good round during the hiding phase

921
01:58:41,859 --> 01:58:56,689
I think we're gonna wait till a couple people join so the teams are more scrambled

922
01:58:57,329 --> 01:59:02,260
I think he's actually high. I'm I'm not i'm just having a good time

923
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:18,020
Don't ever bet on germa's team. We've won a few

924
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:35,149
All right, i'm gonna join now and joining. Oh that lobby doesn't exist

925
01:59:35,869 --> 01:59:45,920
What are the animes that you've watched? I like the kind of mainstream ones attack on titan full metal alchemist

926
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:52,720
um

927
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:53,600
uh

928
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,199
Jujutsu kaisen

929
01:59:55,199 --> 02:00:08,960
Although I don't think it finished that one. I've not seen jojo. No, that's pretty much it though

930
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:13,180
I've seen berserk a long time ago

931
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:15,180
What about mog? I don't think it's an anime

932
02:00:17,810 --> 02:00:19,810
Brother hoodo the original i've seen both

933
02:00:20,699 --> 02:00:26,420
One punch man i've seen season one of one punch man and i've been told just pretend that it ends at season one

934
02:00:30,909 --> 02:00:46,079
Well mob psycho no cowboy bebop long time ago. Oh, I don't have the code. What about evangelion

935
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:53,729
I've seen the final scene of evangelion. That's it though. Maybe I randomly like on adult swim if it used to play

936
02:00:54,369 --> 02:00:59,630
Okay, here we go

937
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:04,829
Please watch mob psycho. I don't have like a plan. I don't really have plan of like watching certain animes or whatever

938
02:01:08,859 --> 02:01:18,399
Um, I just kind of catch them if I you know, feel like it one day. What about one piece?

939
02:01:19,489 --> 02:01:22,050
Um, I okay this is probably gonna piss a lot of people off

940
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:25,090
We're not gonna piss you off but be like, oh dude, what the fuck are you doing?

941
02:01:25,729 --> 02:01:29,569
I watched like the first like season I think of one piece

942
02:01:30,210 --> 02:01:31,890
When the intro had

943
02:01:31,890 --> 02:01:33,890
Yeah, yo, yeah, yo in it

944
02:01:34,529 --> 02:01:36,800
um, so

945
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:43,920
That's all I know

946
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:49,619
the four kids version

947
02:01:49,619 --> 02:01:51,460
Yeah, whatever one goes

948
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:53,460
Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. Give it up

949
02:01:54,829 --> 02:01:58,189
Here's how the story goes. It's no doubt from the treasure in the grand line

950
02:01:58,189 --> 02:02:03,630
It's no doubt. We don't want to be king. I'd be king of the island. He wants to be king. Yeah

951
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:05,630
Yo, yeah, yo

952
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:10,859
Don't give it up. Luffy. Don't give it up. Zolo. Don't give it up

953
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:19,779
Don't give give it up. Give it. I don't I know like most of it. Oh

954
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:22,340
Uh, dude, yeah

955
02:02:22,739 --> 02:02:24,979
Whoa, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, there's a good bite of gum gum

956
02:02:25,699 --> 02:02:34,369
And then yeah, yo, yeah, he spins around with his legs. I don't know why I remember this whole thing. I don't understand

957
02:02:41,069 --> 02:02:46,829
Why do I know the four kids dub because like 15 years ago it was just on tv randomly sometimes

958
02:02:55,310 --> 02:03:00,670
Sub or dub. I mean if it's the four kids version from like almost two decades ago, it's gonna be the dub

959
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:07,779
I keep forgetting you're not 20

960
02:03:10,189 --> 02:03:12,989
That means you watched the four kids one in your 20s

961
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:18,750
Listen to me. I did not tell you that I watched i'm just telling you sometimes it was on tv

962
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:23,149
and like I'd catch the intro and be like, oh, okay, this is a show I guess and then like

963
02:03:23,789 --> 02:03:26,029
And change the fucking channel

964
02:03:26,029 --> 02:03:37,260
I I don't know. I don't know the whole series. Hi. Hello

965
02:03:38,430 --> 02:03:40,739
Hello, I was ready to rock and roll

966
02:03:41,659 --> 02:03:43,979

I'm 24 and I watched it on tv. Yeah, whatever

973
02:04:06,850 --> 02:04:09,020
Because there's all sometimes a ghost

974
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:15,310
Sorry guys. I didn't come across one piece the four kids version when I was like fucking 20 and go

975
02:04:15,470 --> 02:04:19,949
It was a fucking busted. No, no, i'm 20. I can't watch this like I just like I don't know

976
02:04:20,029 --> 02:04:30,529
It was on fucking tv. My only concern is that I can't jump to reduce the ectoplasm

977
02:04:30,529 --> 02:04:33,489
So I don't know what kids is for kids ding you ding

978
02:04:34,289 --> 02:04:38,130

979
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:42,770
I have no idea doesn't shake and the ding is way off in the distance for some reason

980
02:04:43,409 --> 02:04:46,449
Oh, this is this is actually like this is evil

981
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:50,449
It's genuinely 24 and I still watch the care bears leave him alone

982
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:02,979
You browse television

983
02:05:02,979 --> 02:05:08,819
Sorry, by the way guys, i'm old enough for when like I had to change channels to watch tv shows

984
02:05:09,789 --> 02:05:12,319
I had to go like this

985
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:14,319
And see what the fuck was on tv

986
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:17,520
They have a footstep thing. I didn't open an app

987
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:22,159
I didn't open an application and just pick any tv show i've ever wanted to watch and watch it

988
02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:26,079
No, we had to we had to scroll we had to scroll through our tv stations. Peter hates it

989
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:30,960
I mean, I guess we did kind of that makes no sense though. We don't even use our feet

990
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:38,380
That's true

991
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:42,220
Yeah, those of you guys that remember going to the tv guide channel

992
02:05:42,699 --> 02:05:49,739
And watching the scroll the like one mile per hour scroll go steps go steps waiting to see what the fuck was on cartoon network

993
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:53,420
Ding ding ding ding. It's this guy ding ding ding ding

994
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:59,729
See you fucking later. Oh my god. Why did I what happened?

995
02:06:04,989 --> 02:06:06,270
I made it

996
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:11,789
Oh, wow, there's an achievement for taunting 25 times in one game. Yeah, there used to be a channel on tv

997
02:06:11,789 --> 02:06:12,189
Yeah

998
02:06:12,189 --> 02:06:13,630
Did you guys remember that out very quickly?

999
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:18,189
Do you guys remember the tv guide channel where you had to literally there was the shit scrolled and you had to see what was on tv

1000
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:21,859
No, i'm not 45 years old. Why do you ask? Whoa?

1001
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:24,130
Because that guy

1002
02:06:24,130 --> 02:06:26,130
Used to be like that, right? You I apologize

1003
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:31,340
My family had those tv guides like magazines. It was uh

1004
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:37,340
It was a terrible time and you had to look through you had to find what was going to be on tv like on thursday

1005
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:46,659
I don't know why this matters. Um, I who cares but apparently literally all it was was just for me to figure out

1006
02:06:46,739 --> 02:06:48,739
When reruns of the simpsons were on

1007
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:52,899
Wow, literally the most interesting conversation i've had all night jama, so don't worry about it

One day they'll figure out that you can shoot the doors by the way, you can close your door

1011
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:19,460
So just close and open your door all the time

1012

02:07:31,329 --> 02:07:35,010
This is awesome

1015
02:07:35,010 --> 02:07:38,770
Fuck I wanted to be that phone. Remember it doesn't clear your ectoplasm. So you also got a ding

1016
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:49,090

1017
02:07:49,729 --> 02:07:54,479
Oh

Oops, can I I have a ability but I can't area talk for some reason. Yeah. Yo, yeah, yo

02:08:16,899 --> 02:08:21,949
Hello hunters. Can you hear me?

1022
02:08:24,289 --> 02:08:26,369
Give it up luffy

1023
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:32,300
Give it up solo

1024
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:38,529
Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. Give it up. Here's how the story goes

1025
02:08:38,529 --> 02:08:57,619
It's no doubt with the treasure in the grand line. It's no doubt. I'll be king of the pirates. I'm gonna be king

1026
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:04,770
I'm throwing it over there

1027
02:09:04,770 --> 02:09:10,270
I gotta get out of here though

1028
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:13,310
Fell for it. You fell for it. You fell for it. You fell for it. You fell for it. You fell for it

1029
02:09:13,630 --> 02:09:23,789
I got a good spot

1030
02:09:23,789 --> 02:09:25,170
They learned

1031
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:27,250
No, I hit them with a door. I saw that

1032
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:34,909
And then they may have they may have become wise at that point. All right jerma, it's on you

1033
02:09:35,229 --> 02:09:46,989
I'll see what I can do. I'm going for it. Oh, never mind. We can all kill them now. Yeah, let's go for a quick kill

1034
02:09:57,579 --> 02:10:01,260
Jesus

1035
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:02,460
No

1036
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:07,310
Let's drop. Oh, no

1037
02:10:07,310 --> 02:10:08,829
Good game. Good game. Good game

1038
02:10:08,829 --> 02:10:16,430
Kraken I watched as a ghost objected you in the back of the skull

1039
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:19,539
It was why did none of you attack the door?

1040
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:22,819
Like I was hitting people with the door

1041
02:10:24,449 --> 02:10:26,609
I don't know. Sometimes they're useful

1042
02:10:27,409 --> 02:10:32,140
Well, I randomly like I just hit the voice chat button and I ask a stupid question don't let the door hit you

1043
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:35,899
Breakfast let's do a peter griffin impression. It's like i'm like a

1044
02:10:36,859 --> 02:10:38,380
on the way out

1045
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:40,380
Yeah, I was gonna say that as well

1046
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:46,050
I'll be king of the pirates. I want to be king

1047
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:59,920
I like that loadout. It's fun. Actually. No, I don't give me this regular weapon. All right, let's do it. Let's take them up

1048
02:11:02,590 --> 02:11:07,149
That was a good strategy. Hey, uh, hey jerma watch the floor

1049
02:11:07,710 --> 02:11:11,760
What's going on?

1050
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:14,159
I'm spraying the floor. Oh, that's a spray show

1051
02:11:15,409 --> 02:11:17,819
Yeah

1052
02:11:17,819 --> 02:11:19,819
You use the z key

1053
02:11:19,819 --> 02:11:24,800
What is this? Is it spray your steam like avatar?

1054
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:26,640
Yeah

1055
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:29,840
That's what's aiming at the roof. It's just oh, yeah the roof

1056
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:32,560
Oh, that's not bad. Okay

1057
02:11:35,739 --> 02:11:37,739
Alone in the dark

1058
02:11:45,229 --> 02:11:48,909
This is fun. I like how you had the basic strategy of just kill them fast and we did it

1059
02:11:49,310 --> 02:11:52,350
Yeah, just just just swarm. I think the swarm actually makes more sense

1060
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:56,829
Just everybody can come out of their uh furniture and just go right click right click like let's just swarm them

1061
02:11:59,539 --> 02:12:01,939
Jerma, we're we're we're hunting the ghosts this round

1062
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,880
Oh, yeah, but I mean when we are when we're ghosts

1063
02:12:05,739 --> 02:12:06,539
Oh, yeah, okay

1064
02:12:06,539 --> 02:12:09,739
But I mean we also die like crazy when people swarm as humans too

1065
02:12:09,739 --> 02:12:12,779
It's I think when your ghosts you're supposed to catch them

1066
02:12:12,859 --> 02:12:16,539
You're still supposed to catch them by surprise because if you're getting close you just fucking wreck them

1067
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:21,140
Yeah, just like 50 damage a swing. That's kind of insane. Yeah

1068
02:12:23,949 --> 02:12:30,590
By the way, uh, if you have c4 use it in the final end like end round and it just eviscerates them it insta kills them

1069
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:47,739
I wish we could throw our voices as the um humans. I think there's something up here

1070
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:52,350
Oh, where are you at upstairs? It's it's like orange

1071
02:12:53,229 --> 02:12:57,090
Oh, okay jolly over by you gotcha. I'm coming to you

1072
02:13:00,619 --> 02:13:02,619
Got him in somebody back nice

1073
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:08,420
I'll go get one

1074
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:10,420
We only really need one person with a vacuum

1075
02:13:10,819 --> 02:13:14,500
And someone's got it. Yeah. Yeah, I got it. I'm like, okay cool luigi right now

1076
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:18,100
All right. We got luigi upstairs seems pretty clear

1077
02:13:18,819 --> 02:13:26,979
For the moment for the time being we just did that he's a fan check it

1078
02:13:33,310 --> 02:13:34,029
Who was doing that?

1079
02:13:34,029 --> 02:13:37,710
It was like who was talking one of the ghost team like you shut the fuck up when you said he was a fan

1080
02:13:37,869 --> 02:13:39,869
I thought you were making fun of fans

1081
02:13:41,949 --> 02:13:47,569
Well, now he's a wheelchair like I don't want to make fun of wheelchairs and now he's dead do it do it

1082
02:13:48,369 --> 02:13:50,689
No longer a fan of yours. No, I don't think I will

1083
02:13:51,489 --> 02:13:53,729
Whoever on the ghost team is talking right now. You need to shut the fuck up

1084
02:14:06,529 --> 02:14:19,539
Someone someone's up. Somebody's up here. Ah, it's going crazy. You have the radar too jerma. I do. Yeah

1085
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:25,819
All right. I see it too. I guess you just yeah, you're supposed to start shooting stuff. I guess I don't know

1086
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:29,819
I would be the bathtub

1087
02:14:29,819 --> 02:14:32,560
It was me

1088
02:14:41,779 --> 02:14:45,619
This is like the reverse of that black mace of it there's something in somebody's in here

1089
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:49,060
Oh, I think I found him. Yeah

1090
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:50,739
There we go

1091
02:14:53,739 --> 02:14:56,770
I got the vacuum

1092
02:14:56,770 --> 02:15:03,779
Okay, I actually don't have the vacuum. I don't have a vacuum either apparently i'll get it. Oh, sorry. I was distracted

1093
02:15:04,539 --> 02:15:07,199
Should I guard this here?

1094
02:15:07,199 --> 02:15:25,300
Yeah, that'd probably be a good idea. All right, we're good. Awesome. You guys got any activity over there? I'm going back over here

1095
02:15:31,489 --> 02:15:33,260
Yeah, yeah

1096
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:38,020
Okay, come on gwen really. Yeah, come on gwen. Where are you?

1097
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:43,520
Okay, find anything jerma. I think there's somebody up here. It's going crazy right here

1098
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:51,010
I tried the doors

1099
02:15:51,899 --> 02:15:53,579
Yeah the doors

1100
02:15:53,579 --> 02:16:06,609
Could be below. Yeah, I could be below. This is going crazy meat is going crazy. Okay

1101
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,560
Oh, there's a whole basement. You should shoot guys a couple more times. No, where's it at?

1102
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:15,600
In the basement

1103
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:17,600
Ah, shoot, I should have known

1104
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:21,390
Sorry, i'm not good with directions

1105
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:27,949
Maybe it is the basement

1106
02:16:27,949 --> 02:16:37,299
Whoever's on the ghost team right now like just talking needs to shut the fuck up 49 seconds. He's talking about

1107
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:44,930
Like don't think i'm annoying or anything like that

1108
02:16:50,139 --> 02:16:56,479
Imagine being like that pissed. It's like whoever on the ghost team

1109
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:14,799
Where are you? I how can you be so clear but so far away at the same time? I don't understand

1110
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:19,680
I don't understand. How could you be so clear?

1111
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:30,260
Is that a real person? All right, watch out in the hallway bench

1112
02:17:31,299 --> 02:17:33,299
Now there's one uh in the hallway, dude

1113
02:17:34,299 --> 02:17:35,739
He just went down

1114
02:17:35,739 --> 02:17:46,780
He's a little fucking

1115
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:48,780
Damn it. I didn't get out the door in time

1116
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:51,680
Oh, he was a frying pan

1117
02:17:56,290 --> 02:17:57,889
He was so small

1118
02:17:57,889 --> 02:18:08,799
Hey, what was on the ghost team? Just shut the fuck up right now. Nice duck. Where'd you get a duck?

1119
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:11,680
You got a duck what? That's a great duck there

1120
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:14,190
Yeah, I got to duck him up. He's a fridge

1121
02:18:14,190 --> 02:18:18,780
I like the fridge

1122
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:20,459
It didn't do me no good

1123
02:18:20,459 --> 02:18:22,059
Well, i'm just imagining

1124
02:18:22,059 --> 02:18:26,139
Being on the ghost team and hearing in the distance kind of footsteps and being like, you know

1125
02:18:26,379 --> 02:18:28,379
What was on the ghost team doing the fuck up?

1126
02:18:29,389 --> 02:18:31,729
It's just like wow

1127
02:18:31,729 --> 02:18:37,569
Psycho like real life if you lads would like we can do one more if not, I have no problem with calling it here

1128
02:18:38,209 --> 02:18:40,690
I'm down with whatever i'm having fun. I'm having a lot of this is great

1129
02:18:42,319 --> 02:18:53,899
Yeah, I can go another

1130
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:04,930
All right, let me this is this is gonna be a good one here. I think I wanted to copy that sounds fun

1131
02:19:11,729 --> 02:19:13,729
Oh back at the museum level

1132
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:17,729
I feel like the museum is hard for the ghost because everything's so

1133
02:19:18,290 --> 02:19:24,479
in such proximity

1134
02:19:24,479 --> 02:19:26,479
Jerm i have an idea follow me i'm behind you

1135
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:31,329
Okay on it. So

1136
02:19:31,329 --> 02:19:32,770
These two birds

1137
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:34,370
That's actually perfect

1138
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:37,250
I knocked yours over. I'm sorry

1139
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:42,299
Are we gonna make sure they are perfectly aligned?

1140
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:52,940
Beak somebody said beak to beep

1141
02:19:53,659 --> 02:19:55,899
Wait, I shouldn't have said that

1142
02:19:55,899 --> 02:20:03,149
Oh, they can't hear us right now. Now if we're too close, it's too it's obvious

1143
02:20:03,790 --> 02:20:09,120
So if i'm in here and I do the um

1144
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:12,610
genuinely

1145
02:20:12,610 --> 02:20:17,649
That like possess you do the pretend to be another person on their team. Do I have to be out of the

1146
02:20:18,670 --> 02:20:46,370
Object to do it. I think you'll automatically leave the object when you hit it. Oh god. Here they come if we could do something wacky

1147
02:20:50,579 --> 02:20:53,620
We could hold right click and aim at the same person and try to instantly kill them

1148
02:20:56,819 --> 02:21:00,639
Okay, right here. Someone's gonna come investigate in a second

1149
02:21:25,819 --> 02:21:32,100
For fuck's sake

1150
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:34,100
Didn't work. I'm sorry. It didn't work

1151
02:21:35,309 --> 02:21:39,709
That's okay. It was a solid plan. They moved right at the last second and we couldn't get it

1152
02:21:40,270 --> 02:21:43,649
We're still alive though. So that's good

1153
02:21:43,649 --> 02:21:44,690
Yeah

1154
02:21:44,690 --> 02:22:05,090
Just like walking around

1155
02:22:21,659 --> 02:22:23,659
Oh shit we're blocking each other

1156
02:22:32,979 --> 02:22:35,180
Do it

1157
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:37,180
Do it do it

1158
02:22:51,459 --> 02:22:53,459
Oh, no, please

1159
02:22:53,700 --> 02:23:47,780
Oh my god, I forgot that you guys hear that. Holy shit. I'm so sorry. I forgot that you're hearing that on the stream

1160
02:23:48,399 --> 02:23:51,520
I'm like just fucking with him like oh, he's definitely not the pig. I don't ever know

1161
02:23:52,299 --> 02:23:56,379
I i'm trying to do pig noises over there. So they think like oh he's pretending to be the pig

1162
02:23:56,540 --> 02:24:02,459
You know what I mean? Yeah, but you guys will hear it. I don't want to fuck with you guys

1163
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:38,909
You good? Oh

1164
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:42,180
Looks like bugleberry

1165
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:47,040
But we still have up just one two

1166
02:24:47,709 --> 02:24:57,059
Two. Yeah, they got all four. All right, it's gonna be tough. I stayed in one spot the entire game. Did you really?

1167
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:00,819
It was a cup of a brontosaurus dead

1168
02:25:06,430 --> 02:25:14,270
By the way, the shunt ability after you're dead is really powerful and i'm playing fucking soccer with the sun right now

1169
02:25:15,229 --> 02:25:17,389
Oh us pigs love to roll around in mud

1170
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:21,780
Us pigs love rolling around in mud

1171
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:42,370
Back here ow squeeze his hog

1172
02:25:50,940 --> 02:25:53,420
Oh, all right, we got it. We got it. We got it. Get him

1173
02:26:00,590 --> 02:26:02,590
I'm not gonna squeeze

1174
02:26:03,309 --> 02:26:04,909
It's very cramped in here

1175
02:26:04,909 --> 02:26:10,030
There's one thing that people hate. It's why I can't believe we lost like pig squealing noises. Nobody likes it

1176
02:26:10,030 --> 02:26:12,590
They hate it people. It's like dude. Don't like I hate that sound

1177
02:26:13,149 --> 02:26:17,569
That's a good game

1178
02:26:17,569 --> 02:26:20,290
Alone and alone in the dark illumination therma

1179
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:25,940
Um, i've had the same profile picture for like at least five years or so

1180
02:26:27,219 --> 02:26:32,500
Okay, fair enough mine's probably since 2007 so I get you I kind of have this burned in my brain

1181
02:26:33,219 --> 02:26:36,260
Of hiding in team fortress. Oh, they can't hear me anymore

1182
02:26:37,899 --> 02:26:42,459
Uh, you'd change your profile picture and my name would be like fucking like inspector gadget

1183
02:26:42,860 --> 02:26:54,659
So people wouldn't know it was me. I gotta I could explain that i'm gonna ask you gemma why gas can

1184
02:26:55,620 --> 02:26:57,620
Okay, I I can give a really good explanation

1185
02:26:58,020 --> 02:27:03,120
so back in the day I used to make team fortress 2 videos, right and

1186
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:06,399
I would if I was if I was germa

1187
02:27:06,879 --> 02:27:11,520
Like germa 985 in a team fortress 2 game with like a germa profile picture or something

1188
02:27:12,159 --> 02:27:18,159
People would see it and people would stand at the spawn and like high five and the whole game sometimes would get all messed up

1189
02:27:18,799 --> 02:27:20,559
So what I started doing

1190
02:27:20,559 --> 02:27:27,280
Is just starting making my name something completely different every single day and changing my avatar to something different every single day

1191
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:29,920
So I could just nobody would even know it was me

1192
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:37,120
Gemma i'm gonna be real. I was in the menu like the ready menu for 90% of that conversation

1193
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:39,600
So I joined in until like the last two seconds of it

1194
02:27:42,020 --> 02:27:43,620
All right tldr

1195
02:27:43,620 --> 02:27:44,899
tldr

1196
02:27:44,899 --> 02:27:50,100
Uh back in team fortress 2 I used to hide so people wouldn't know it was me playing so like I could be I could get

1197
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:55,540
Like a real gameplay that wasn't like five pocket medics and like five people outside the spawn trying to high five me

1198
02:27:57,069 --> 02:27:58,909
You got right pirate spy

1199
02:27:58,909 --> 02:28:04,209
Yeah, I I used to watch you gemma. I still watch you

1200
02:28:04,690 --> 02:28:06,209
Oh cool

1201
02:28:06,209 --> 02:28:07,329
That's cool

1202
02:28:07,329 --> 02:28:09,649
I'm watching you trying to act like a normal person

1203
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:13,760
Fucking hilarious. Hey, I

1204
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:19,819
I wake up in the morning like everybody else. I brush my teeth once a week

1205
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:21,579
I

1206
02:28:21,579 --> 02:28:23,659
Wear pants sometimes maybe once a week

1207
02:28:24,379 --> 02:28:28,940
I'm a normal person just like okay. At what point do you clean up the blood of your last night's victim?

1208
02:28:31,889 --> 02:28:33,250
Yes

1209
02:28:33,250 --> 02:28:36,209
All right. Now I know I let you know. I know you watch now

1210
02:28:36,209 --> 02:28:38,209
I know you watch the channel speaks volumes

1211
02:28:40,690 --> 02:28:50,459
Now i'm good. Now. I know you watch uh, we got a jolly imposter over here, by the way

1212
02:28:52,670 --> 02:28:55,229
Hey, come here. Come here. What do you what do you want to go the word?

1213
02:28:56,059 --> 02:28:58,059
Do you do you want to go upstairs? What do you think they should be?

1214
02:28:58,959 --> 02:29:02,239
Wait, that's the real person. What? Hey, what's the emote button?

1215
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:08,000
Post to fake people. Wait, how is that the real there was two jollies on the screen? Did I follow the wrong one?

1216
02:29:09,090 --> 02:29:11,010

Peace offering

1218
02:29:15,940 --> 02:29:20,340
Wait, why are there two me? Okay, somebody's fucking pretending to be me. I followed the wrong one

1219
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:22,020
I thought you were the fake one

1220
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:24,020
Geez, that's not me

1221
02:29:28,659 --> 02:29:33,299

1222
02:29:33,299 --> 02:29:47,500
My dick, bro

1223
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:53,010
That's weird

1224
02:29:53,010 --> 02:29:57,459
No activity over here

1225
02:29:57,459 --> 02:29:58,500

1226
02:29:58,500 --> 02:30:17,090
I'm not getting i'm not getting any activity at all. Here we go. Somebody over here. No, they're moving. They're on the move

1227
02:30:23,979 --> 02:30:29,739
um

1228
02:30:29,739 --> 02:30:31,739
That's is this somebody here

1229
02:30:35,219 --> 02:30:36,659
He was the duck

1230
02:30:36,659 --> 02:30:38,659
Of course, he's the fucking duck

1231
02:30:40,610 --> 02:30:44,850
That spy is not one of us that heavy is a spy that sniper is a heavy that heavy

1232
02:30:44,850 --> 02:30:49,809
He's not one of us that one of us is you I made that joke like 10 years ago. God was it good

1233
02:30:59,579 --> 02:31:01,579
Listen, you didn't know I was the duck

1234
02:31:01,979 --> 02:31:03,979
You you had no idea

1235
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:10,860
At this point you do the duck so often that like you aren't the duck now, you know what I mean?

1236
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:17,440
I see the strats

1237
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:20,479
Yeah

1238
02:31:20,479 --> 02:31:21,760
Uh

1239
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:28,670
Did you find anything?

1240
02:31:28,670 --> 02:31:32,590
I am not getting anything

1241
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:34,110
Just keep shooting

1242
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:39,500
There's a little bit up in the run away a little bit in this room, but it keeps going up and down

1243
02:31:41,219 --> 02:31:45,780
It'll go down if they're taunting or jumping or moving in any way really?

1244
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:48,340
Okay, so they so they can just move backwards and forwards

1245
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:55,229
There's a ectoplasm meter on your right hand side when you're a ghost. I mean that fills up you become more

1246
02:31:56,030 --> 02:31:57,870
aware

1247
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:01,950
Yeah, they can see you easier. So as long as you keep that low, he's totally one of these ducks

1248
02:32:02,670 --> 02:32:10,590
Are they all ducks? I could see that as a strap. I wanted to be all spacemen. The spacemen are fucking creepy

1249
02:32:12,190 --> 02:32:14,190
It's actually probably a really stupid spots

1250
02:32:14,510 --> 02:32:17,870
Just to be all be the same item and just be in the same room and spread out

1251
02:32:17,950 --> 02:32:20,940
Be like why would they ever do that?

1252
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:26,059
Also, there's a little orc with the headphones on that nobody's ever been and I feel like that's a missed opportunity

1253
02:32:27,020 --> 02:32:29,100
In here in here trash can in here on me

1254
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:33,459
trash can

1255
02:32:33,459 --> 02:32:34,500

1256
02:32:34,500 --> 02:32:43,889
It's cranking. He's low

1257
02:32:43,889 --> 02:32:48,069
Got him. Yep. Oh, there's another one here. There's another one the triceratops

1258
02:32:55,659 --> 02:32:58,049

1259
02:32:58,049 --> 02:33:00,270
he's over here is a

1260
02:33:00,270 --> 02:33:01,309
zebra, oh

1261
02:33:01,309 --> 02:33:04,100
Nope, somebody's booted up that game boy

1262
02:33:08,450 --> 02:33:10,450
Oh, it's the smile go one

1263
02:33:11,010 --> 02:33:19,420
What the fuck rambert kite them don't stand still

1264
02:33:20,139 --> 02:33:22,139

02:33:22,780 --> 02:33:26,379
I had my body was immediately died. Well, yeah. Okay. Good. Cool

1266
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:31,899
I swear to god. I got stuck on the staircase. I couldn't move. I couldn't walk forward. No pressure. No pressure like I was

1267
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,940
Pretend you're playing doom eternal

1268
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:37,420

Yeah, what was that like?

1271
02:33:47,149 --> 02:33:56,340
Chili

1272
02:33:56,340 --> 02:34:04,530
Somebody said don't come back to boston

1273
02:34:06,049 --> 02:34:08,370

1274
02:34:09,329 --> 02:34:12,690
Oh, that was amazing. I don't want don't come back here. I don't want you here

1275
02:34:17,579 --> 02:34:22,860
Like i'm gonna make a big announcement like boston i'm coming back i'm here what like i'm but i'm not annoying

1276
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:25,500
Oh god, everyone's after you

1277
02:34:26,770 --> 02:34:29,250
You've changed I am the last one left

1278
02:34:30,129 --> 02:34:32,129
Would make sense. Yes

1279
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:37,170
You're near the supply center if you can get there and kill yourself. No, that's that's bullshit

1280
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:40,260
that's not a chance, but

1281
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:42,260
Oh, they're they're on you. Oh god

1282
02:34:45,579 --> 02:34:48,379
That is so scary. Oh good try

1283
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:52,180
That was scary

1284
02:34:52,180 --> 02:34:56,690
Nice. Nice. Nice. That was spooky. I love the bear

1285
02:34:58,590 --> 02:35:01,920
bear and astronaut there

1286
02:35:02,319 --> 02:35:06,530
All right, i'm gonna head back into discord and unmute and just thank everybody

1287
02:35:07,329 --> 02:35:09,010
Cool sounds good

1288
02:35:09,010 --> 02:35:10,530
Sounds good. Okay

1289
02:35:10,530 --> 02:35:18,260
I've unmuted

1290
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:23,219
You know what that was pretty good for a bootleg prop hunt on tmachel. Yeah, it was fun. No, that was a lot of fun

1291
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:26,659
Yeah

1292
02:35:26,659 --> 02:35:31,780
Uh, I think it could use a little bit of work in some spots and the balancing is weird

1293
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:35,780
but and also the positional voice chat's like a little too low, but

1294
02:35:36,979 --> 02:35:38,979
Yeah, it was great. I enjoyed it

1295
02:35:39,549 --> 02:35:43,250
Yeah, I think that some of the weapons maybe need some uh tuning

1296
02:35:44,459 --> 02:35:48,059
But I think it was overall it was overall a solid experience. That's a lot of fun

1297
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:52,079
Jerma, I I use a assault shotgun in real life

1298
02:35:52,639 --> 02:35:54,639
To defend against mosquitoes

1299
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:58,159
And and they're expecting me to use that against ghosts

1300
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:00,979
I mean it worked

1301
02:36:00,979 --> 02:36:04,100
I had well, I added the extended mag for my shotgun

1302
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:07,540
So it had two barrels with three shots and that was just amusing the whole time

1303
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:12,500
It also killed ghost pretty well too if you remember it's certainly my favorite gun. No, that was that was fun

1304
02:36:13,899 --> 02:36:20,370
Cool. Well, I appreciate everybody joining. Um, hey, let's do let's do this again. Let's do this again sometime. Absolutely

1309
02:36:45,899 --> 02:36:53,889
Okay, i'm listening. I like the vr version but yeah, so it seems pretty kind of that's necessary but seems cool

1310
02:36:55,100 --> 02:36:56,620
So yeah, um

1311

Wanted to do DOS tomorrow, but I want a little bit more time to curate some more

1342
02:41:15,860 --> 02:41:20,620
Because I have like 30 DOS games in Windows 3.1 games

1343
02:41:20,620 --> 02:41:24,860
I think I got a maybe get a couple more and shave some down because it's just so many

So we'll do that this weekend. But tomorrow tomorrow, we're gonna play wrestling Empire an update came out

1346
02:41:41,430 --> 02:41:46,620
We're gonna start about 4 o'clock Pacific tomorrow and we'll get back into wrestling Empire

1347
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:55,219
There's a GM mode now where you can just walk around town as the general manager of a league we're doing that, right?

1353
02:42:36,319 --> 02:42:46,459
It's my first experience really with prop hunt. I have to eat a shoe now. I did I I played Shido in the beginning

1354
02:42:46,459 --> 02:42:59,440
There's no batteries, but this is what that's what she'd have would have sounded like I pressed the buttons to play

1355
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:03,659
It was just very soft because the Shido is out of batteries, but you can still very soft

1356
02:43:03,659 --> 02:43:24,420
You just couldn't hear it daily Shito. Okay, so who's still live from that group?

1357
02:43:24,540 --> 02:43:28,420
It's like Vinny or Kraken or Ross anybody still live from that group of people

1358
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:44,620
Was everybody kind of taking off they're all still like let's let's go. Um, it's been it was very let's write Kraken

1359
02:43:44,620 --> 02:43:49,860
It's been a while. It's been a while since we have said hello to Kraken, which is cool to play with them

1360
02:43:50,219 --> 02:44:10,579
Okay, here we go. I will see you guys later. He's playing some kind of stream game. Oh, really? That'd be interesting

1361
02:44:10,579 --> 02:44:13,139
Hopefully I don't like

1362
02:44:13,540 --> 02:44:19,190
Ruin it. Is he doing like a stream chat game? Oh god
