1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,040
This shirt is like wet with sweat.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:22,839
All right, let me set this up. See, we're just fine. Everything's fine. Put that over here.

3
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,539
There's seven fucking thousand people here. I'm gonna change it off from IRL. We're gonna go back

4
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:39,429
to Lifeline. I'm gonna try to finish Lifeline. Or I'm gonna try at least a handful of times.

5
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:59,700
Let's see. Trying to finish talk at game. Game. You look kind of pale. I feel uh, I kind of feel

6
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:13,989
I feel pretty good. Trying to finish to finish. That's a good title. Trying to finish

7
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:30,629
to finish. Right, that's literally what's going on. Lifeline. This is joke on a joke. Okay,

8
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:35,420
by the way, if you were participating only for the festivities of,

9
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:45,530
well it wasn't really festivities, it was more along the lines of just me sitting here with

10
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:52,519
like a bunch of goofy dumb shit on, panicking and nothing happening. So if you enjoyed that,

11
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm glad you did. But we're gonna transition to a stupid PlayStation 2 game where you

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,680
have to yell at the microphone. If you want to see what it looks like, here it is.

13
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:23,909
Yeah! That's unfortunate. This is the microphone I have to use. It goes like this. And you have

14
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:31,960
to talk to the lady on the screen. Oh, but somebody's saying uh, big bits came in.

15
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,050
Ta-bunk. I might not have the right hairstyle for that. All right, let me turn on the

16
00:02:49,050 --> 00:03:04,229
PlayStation 2. Let's boot it up. Reset transformation on that. We're gonna try to

17
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:12,259
just go right where we left off. Why is this so small? It shouldn't be like that.

18
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:23,699
The PlayStation 1 sound is better. Uh, Brolok. Brolok, you are at the 24-hour cool-off period,

19
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:30,969
man. That's a hundred dollars from Brolok. You are actually at the cool-off period.

20
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:39,319
It hasn't even been 24 hours. We got nine hundred dollars now. Nine hundred and fifty bucks.

21
00:03:39,960 --> 00:04:00,710
Oh, nine hundred and five. God. Holy shit, man. Nearly a fucking thousand dollars.

22
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:13,419
Let's go. Make sure I get my tabs open because I just started here. Let's bring the volume down

23
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:26,490
a little. That belongs over here. But, Brolok, honestly, I really hope that you're

24
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:33,420
taking care of yourself first. That's an extreme amount of money to give anyone.

25
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,310
I really hope that you are within the means to give or do so. Thank you so much for the

26
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:51,480
ridiculous amount of money. Trying to finish to finish. We are updated with the correct information.

27
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:19,079
Hold on. I gotta get to the screen first. I should have all my tabs. I do. Lifeline.

28
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:26,170
No. Sweat check. It's the whole shirt. We can't do a check on it. It's the entire article of

29
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:35,000
clothing. So I have to go here. All right. We're ready to start. If you don't know what's going

30
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,750
on, Lifeline is a game where you have to speak instructions to a girl on the screen

31
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,019
and she you can't control it any other way. It's only through that. This is

32
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,939
a spoiler for this game because literally we're at the last hour or two of the game.

33
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,379
I might not even complete it because the game is a fucking mess and sometimes does not listen

34
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:15,370
to a goddamn thing you say. But I'm going to try. Wrong. Well, it is not wrong. It's my

35
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:29,959
opinion. I'm fine. I think it's a great game. I think it's a great idea. I'm not. I'm fine.

36
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:39,589
Make sure they can hear me. So we're at the last portion of the game. Just Broluck. Broluck. Bro.

37
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:53,750
Hey. Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. You just. Broluck. That's a thousand dollars. A thousand. One

38
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,709
thousand in one day. A thousand dollars in a day. One thousand dollars in a day.

39
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,279
Broluck just donated a thousand dollars. Get up. Okay. I got it already.

40
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,579
They say, all right, man, that's it. That's it for me for a while.

41
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,300
Just letting you know that this amount is okay for me to donate.

42
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,339
Been watching you since I was in high school and you helped me along the way.

43
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:26,660
The tragic part is, in Australian dollars, a hundred bits is two dollars.

44
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:38,360
Enjoy. Oh my god. Did you. That's a. That's thousands. I hope. I hope you got some like

45
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:50,660
Monopoly man money because holy shit. Case three. Case three. Run. Yes. Was it 15? 50? 15?

46
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:06,980
It's not here. Someone's taken it already. We need to find Alan Honda.

47
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:12,339
You don't need to see this shit anyways. Operator, hold on a sec.

48
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,019
This cord, what is this? So many people already have no idea what's going on.

49
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:25,060
But it's all right. This can't be. Listen, can you analyze this device?

50
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,939
There's no time limit on here anyways.

51
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,580
Is that a good place for me to be? We're racing against time. Hurry, analyze it.

52
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,899
Okay. There's no mistake. It's a bomb. Yes, I know what it is. I've seen it like 10 times

53
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:52,740
now. I know it's a bomb. The sum of the last digits of today's date. Okay, you found the

54
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,740
right instructions to defuse it. Can you read them to me? Out of sync? We'll think it

55
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:14,230
through. Oh yeah, the webcam is. What's the first one? Now we're going. Enter the sum of

56
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:21,350
the last digits of today's date. Okay, yes, that's easy. Today is December 24th, 2029.

57
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,429
So the last digit of each one would be 249.

58
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,309
15, 50, 15, right?

59
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:56,379
Game is too loud? Yes. I got it. I got it. The music blasting.

60
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,460
All right, let's get to the part where I need to get to.

61
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,779
Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel.

62
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:16,940
It's not 13. She's going to stop me. She goes, wait.

63
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,610
All right, let's go. I know what it is.

64
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,529
Somebody's saying emulate this and get it to this part. Just so I'm able

65
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,889
to just go through this part. There's no other save point until you'll see what happens here.

66
00:10:46,779 --> 00:11:00,070
50. Okay, what's the next step for diffusing this? I'm going to move some of these windows

67
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:10,340
around. That's back. That's a better spot for all my windows. All right. Enter the sum

68
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:22,200
of the last digits of PM Takayama's birthday. How old is she in the game? I actually

69
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:39,029
don't know. That's a good question. You need to keep moving. You need to keep moving.

70
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:51,690
Did he? I don't remember. I only saw it last night. I have no idea how old this girl is.

71
00:11:51,690 --> 00:12:06,250
I don't know. This part takes 20 minutes and the part where you die

72
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:16,600
takes five. I know it's hell. It's hell doing this. Yes, I know. It's 15.

73
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,840
So it's left soldier, right soldier. I got to be very clear.

74
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:34,059
And the fact that I only have one little health bar, it sucks. No, it's not seven. 15.

75
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,240
Okay, I'm going to, I got to move this because this is old and I don't want to

76
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,779
drink out of this. This is the part that I've died out like seven or eight times last night.

77
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,879
Remember, this takes 20 minutes or so to do this part. Oh, I got to get it ready.

78
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:03,460
Do you like to take a break? There we go. She's going to do the whole thing with,

79
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,169
can we be friends when I get out of here? Can we be relatives or something?

80
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:19,340
Well, whatever the fuck she says. Yeah. Unskippable. It's crazy because select

81
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:26,139
skips cutscenes, but not this one and not any of the ones leading up to where I need to be.

82
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:38,100
For some reason they decided that that was a good idea. What am I going to say this time?

83
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:59,399
What do you think? Ready? I feel like I never went to bed. Is that weird? I feel like I'm

84
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,399
still here from yesterday. And you know, it's funny. It was today. It was this morning.

85
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:17,210
If we get back to earth safely, you think we could actually meet somewhere

86
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:25,580
like normal friends? Yeah. On Facebook, add me on Facebook. Look, you don't need to be a jerk.

87
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,779
I was being serious and now you make me feel like an idiot.

88
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:43,990
We really have to find her. We've got to Facebook. That isn't very insulting.

89
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,309
Actually, that's extraordinarily insulting. Facebook. Yeah, I'll add you on Facebook, I guess.

90
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,399
All right. Left soldier, right soldier, red lever, yellow lever, red lever, yellow lever,

91
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:10,870
red lever, red, shoot red, shoot red lever. Left soldier, right soldier, red lever, shoot

92
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:27,720
yellow, shoot yellow lever. I got it. Red lever, shoot red, shoot yellow. That's as clear

93
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:38,600
as I could possibly make it. Shoot yellow. Left soldier. Here we go. All right, here we go.

94
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,799
Come on. Come on. We're going to get that first try. It's not lever. That's a soap company.

95
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,799
Lever 2000.

96
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:07,929
Shoot yellow. Left soldier. What? Soldier. It's soldier. Red lever, red lever, left soldier.

97
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:37,750
No, I'm not faxing you my feet. Okay. Pay attention. Here we go. Left soldier.

98
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:52,419
Shoot red. Shoot, shoot, shoot red. Shoot yellow. Left soldier. Right soldier.

99
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:24,809
Shoot. I'm not saying shoot. Shoot red. Left soldier. Right soldier. Hide. Shoot red.

100
00:17:26,890 --> 00:18:12,069
Hide. Hide. Shoot red. Hide. Shoot left. Shoot red. Shoot red. The right soldier. Red lever.

101
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:28,579
But I said shoot red. Oh my god. And when you shoot the soldier, it doesn't even do anything.

102
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,700
You shoot them, they go, oh, and then they keep fighting you. What? It doesn't do anything.

103
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:44,380
It doesn't do anything when you shoot them. I can't fucking believe this,

104
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,950
that you have to do this whole thing again. Somebody just fell asleep at the at the fucking

105
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,349
computer to like have this be a reality. This is the only save point. You have to do the whole

106
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:58,549
entire cut scene again. Somebody fell asleep making this game. Get up. Okay, I got it already.

107
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:10,279
Case three. Case three. Okay. How do I fast forward the stream? Run. Yes. What are you

108
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,589
doing? What's going on with this fucking audio and video? And I don't have any health.

109
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:24,180
They made the health packs like Resident Evil 1 in this game. Like if you don't, if you run

110
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:33,109
out of them, you lose. Somebody look up those cheats for the PlayStation 2 version. No click

111
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:52,740
through the fucking wall. I don't care. I need to get a game shark. The fact that you have

112
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,900
to do this again. What were you doing when you made this portion? How did you think that this

113
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,339
was a good? How? How is it? Why would you make not have a save point? Why would you make this

114
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:09,700
the part that can't skip it? Can you read them to me? Well, we will we do it. Why would you

115
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:15,559
sit in the office? What's the first? And you would you run it? Did you run out of time?

116
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:25,299
Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date. Okay, yes. Nobody but me got to this

117
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:36,940
point. This is a speedrun of this game. Skip cutscenes with L2 and select.

118
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:55,819
Didn't I do that already? Select worked before. I used L2. No, they don't work.

119
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,799
Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel. Thanks for the save point.

120
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:31,769
Careful with this. Safe point. Wait a second. It's not 13. It's neither. It's the number of

121
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:36,890
checked in guests. Use the speedrun as a walkthrough. And enter that number.

122
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:59,190
I'm gonna see. I'm gonna mimic exactly what this person says. Okay, what's the next step?

123
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:14,970
I don't think there even is. Does it even exist? Enter the sum of the last digits of

124
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:23,289
PM Takeyama's birthday. What's going on with this fucking thing? What the fuck is happening?

125
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:35,259
It just got dark. Yeah, this is how it ends. It ends with me fucking snapping. I'm gonna put the

126
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:52,250
disk in my shredder. This is how what's gonna happen here. Holy shit. This cable's broken,

127
00:22:52,250 --> 00:23:01,049
I think. No, it's not. I think we're good. Shred the disk. Shred this fucking disk.

128
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:11,079
You're right. Didn't he say something about that at some point? I know. I am right.

129
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:23,539
Big coffee cup. It is. I'm a streamer. We drink coffee, you know. We drink coffee and

130
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:29,380
sip on it for two, four hours straight, dude. That was a huge vein. Did you see that?

131
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:53,930
The blood pressure is rising. All right, should I? Stop talking, lady.

132
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,930
All right, here's what I'm gonna try. I think I'm just gonna not even worry about the fucking

133
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,410
soldiers. I'm just gonna shoot. I'm gonna... Red lever. Yellow lever. Red lever. Red lever.

134
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,210
I'm just gonna hide and shoot. Every time I try to deal with the soldiers, I say like,

135
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,210
left shoulder, right soldier, right soldier, left soldier, and she just doesn't shoot in

136
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:26,900
the right direction. We've seen it like five times now. You have to say shoot red. I just,

137
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:34,710
I tried that. Shoot red. Shoot red. And then everyone got mad because they're saying red

138
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,670
lever. And then when I do that, people get mad because they're saying shoot red.

139
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,170
I don't want to see this again. You can't just, while you're talking, walk over to the kiosk

140
00:24:48,170 --> 00:25:00,859
and punch in the code to do the safe point. It's because I have a Boston accent. It's,

141
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:08,630
but it's, it's not... Red lever is... It's not like I'm going, ah, red lever. Open up the

142
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:18,180
red lever, dude. Red lever. Red lever. Shoot red. Red lever. That's not what I'm saying.

143
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:28,380
Oh yeah, by the way, uh, pick me up with some clam chowder while you got a chance.

144
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:44,630
Sorry my fucking Boston accent is really screwing this game up. I fucking can't help it. I say

145
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:54,500
like ahs and hs and ahs. I have not said like ah the whole playthrough. Listen to the,

146
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,700
listen to the sound of my voice. This is the way I've been talking the whole time.

147
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,559
Some of you guys are making it sound like I'm like, hey, can you like go over there

148
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:24,619
and pick up some of the thing on the ground? Don't make me make my fucking chin bigger.

149
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:46,490
You can skip it with select. Sometimes you gotta prove it on the webcam.

150
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,339
Is it bootleg controller? No, it's not. This is an officially licensed controller.

151
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:09,109
All right. Red lever. Red lever. I'm stuck in a time loop right now and I have to get out of

152
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:19,619
it. I'm stuck in a time loop. I'm stuck in a time loop right now. Licensed by mad cats.

153
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:28,039
I'm just gonna do it with a Boston accent. Speedrun strat is just say red,

154
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,559
but wouldn't that she spuck that up sometimes and think I'm saying right?

155
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:55,799
Take a med kit. I don't have any med kits. There are no med kits. There are zero.

156
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:59,769
Red. Red. Red. Shoot. Red. Red lever. Hide. Right soldier. Hide. Yellow lever.

157
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:20,440
Hide. Yellow lever. Yellow lever. Hide. You fucking assholes. Red lever.

158
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:46,140
Yellow lever. Yes. What does it say in the walkthrough? What does it say in the

159
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,299
walkthrough? Somebody please. I need this. I can't do this again. Please give me a save point.

160
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:17,779
What happens now? What happens now? You have to say run. Say run. Right? It was save run

161
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:24,299
when I got the opportunity. Save run. Run. Is that enough to have an accent for you?

162
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,259
Run. Run. Run.

163
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:13,980
Run.

164
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:39,980
Is that? Is that? Worst ending? I don't care. That took like four and a half hours to do that.

165
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,950
More than that. I have to let the others know. Give me a save point please.

166
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:53,339
I don't. Do you have? Why would you do this to me? There's got to be a safe point in this

167
00:31:53,339 --> 00:32:18,380
room. What do I do now? What should I do? Something terrible is happening.

168
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:45,269
Run again? Should I run again? Somebody look it up for me. I don't have a computer in front of me.

169
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:50,230
I have a PlayStation 2 computer monitor screen. I don't have an actual computer.

170
00:32:51,829 --> 00:33:01,619
Run. Run. Calm down. Corridor open. Wait. Hold on. Okay. Run. R.I.P. Gino. I understand.

171
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:05,460
I feel the same way. He should have been in Smash. But you got to give me the actual

172
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:17,160
thing I need to do. So it's calm down. I don't care about cheating right now because I don't

173
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,569
care about a thing about this. We're not doing another fucking 42 minute cut scene

174
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:29,960
scenario. It's literally sexy pose. No it's not. I'm not getting baited that hard.

175
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:47,769
No no no. Somebody just had it. You just put it in there. I can't look it up. I have no

176
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:02,779
spam to keep the advice away. I'm trying to cheat here and you're making it very

177
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:10,579
difficult for me. Okay here we go. This is I gotta I gotta walk through here.

178
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:21,909
Let's go all the way to the bottom. If it's not sexy pose. I just want to make sure you

179
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:40,630
guys are aware of this. If it's not sexy pose. I'm turning off the stream. All you're gonna

180
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:51,019
do is make a threat. Bring back the music. Okay trying to find a walkthrough of this

181
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:59,019
game is like it's not like easy to find a real one. Lifeline PS2. Well I got my

182
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:03,179
computer here. I was lying. Okay here we go. Here's a walkthrough. I don't care. I'm

183
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:11,260
gonna read this. Here's a full walkthrough. All the way to the bottom here because this

184
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:31,780
is the end of the game. There's so much more to the game. This this is like another two

185
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:43,159
and a half hours to this game. Okay use the door. Press case three. All right.

186
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:50,730
There's the shootout. The Marines show up. It's stuck. Later run when Geno fights the

187
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:56,809
alien. If you decide to stay behind and help you'll be killed. Thank god. Trust me when I

188
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:01,610
say you don't want to do this part. They actually wrote that in the walkthrough of

189
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:07,769
the game. Trust me when I say you don't want to do this part again. UGH exclamation

190
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:13,719
point. Even in the walkthrough they hate it. After it's all over tell Rio to cheer

191
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:24,500
up and on you go to the testing ward. There's been an unfortunate incident.

192
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:31,369
We set an explosive but it seems that one of your people has diffused it. What is that

193
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,530
supposed to mean? I never gave you orders to blow up the station.

194
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:46,309
We don't take orders from you. What? Aren't you here to rescue us? Rescue?

195
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:52,809
How presumptuous. Who on earth told you that? We are soldiers for a new world order.

196
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:57,179
Our sole purpose here is to obtain a relic with incredible power.

197
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:04,460
Having accomplished our objective we are now leaving. Alan you're with these terrorists as

198
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:12,699
well? I but I this being Christmas my gift to you is a quick painless death by one very

199
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:16,139
impressive explosion. I need to be ready to do exactly what this thing tells me to do.

200
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:20,380
Now I have no choice but to dispose of you. I just happen to do this whole thing again like

201
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,139
they said UGH exclamation point. Wait take me as your hostage.

202
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:40,360
What? Are you sure that I just have to cheer up while running into the fire?

203
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:51,750
Trust me to say the then witness the after it's all over tell her to cheer up.

204
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,119
You monsters you herded them here to kill them not for rescue.

205
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:21,139
Hey exactly and you've conveniently returned to die as well.

206
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:36,980
Cheer up tell her to cheer up. I curse you killed a great man. Curse you. I'll finish her.

207
00:38:49,849 --> 00:39:01,159
Oh she's the alien. She's the alien. That's the climax of the story. I curse you.

208
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:23,670
Oh sexy pose yeah I'm sure it is.

209
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:31,670
I brew my own coffee. I brew my own coffee with my own percolator.

210
00:39:36,340 --> 00:40:03,929
Only real only real coffee enthusiasts do that. I used to drink Dunkin' Donuts every

211
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:08,010
fucking day. What are you talking about? In fact I think this might even be Doug.

212
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,570
This is there's okay then I'm gonna return this. I'm gonna return wherever I got this

213
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:26,460
coffee. That's a hair. There's a hair in my coffee and that's a big hair. Any more hairs?

214
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:41,530
I knew it. I'm ignoring the plot. Who am I? Um okay I'm a descendant of Paracelsus

215
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,250
the scientist from Alan's disc. The story of Paracelsus and the philosopher's stone is more

216
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:54,489
than just a legend. It's real. It's the stone that I've been trying to find. It's an heirloom

217
00:40:54,489 --> 00:41:00,579
that my family has guarded since Paracelsus time. It began to influence my life when I was

218
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:09,929
only a child. I told you guys that she was like coming to steal it. The geologist's name was

219
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:20,300
Joseph Kraft. Those two spent years researching the stone and they eventually uncovered the

220
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:28,699
secret nature of it. Physically the philosopher's stone is pretty much your basic rock but what's

221
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:35,960
uncanny about it is the composition. Completely uniform throughout. Whether stone or metal it's

222
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,719
impossible to manufacture solids of entirely uniform composition on earth. Why you ask?

223
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:47,110
It was a dog hair. Because of gravity. The same night they concluded their analysis of the stone

224
00:41:48,230 --> 00:42:03,269
Kraft shot my dad. It was one of your nose hairs like this fucking huge. He also shot me.

225
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:16,139
I survived but my mom and dad weren't so lucky. No save point yet by the way. Kraft was trying to

226
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:23,449
steal the philosopher's stone but dad had it protected. Fearing for my safety I fled to Japan.

227
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:44,059
I just wanted to forget everything. Kraft back in cheese. But then I saw it on the news.

228
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,929
Oh I gotta my does my tweet say I'm doing an IRL hang up? The channel's negative or positive

229
00:42:51,929 --> 00:43:01,300
emotion from spoken words. With the stone you can heal or corrupt. If I die I get to sit this I

230
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,139
know I don't want to sit through this again. At least according to research data taken by

231
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:10,679
Joseph Kraft. From what I can tell he used the stolen research to build a replica of the

232
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:18,309
stone in the lab on this space station. I guess with all the chaos going on he was

233
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:26,570
planning to steal the real stone and blame it on the aliens. Right I mean this is what we're

234
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,050
seeing. Even if that means killing everyone in the hotel to ensure their silence.

235
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:39,780
But why does he want the stone so much? I don't get it. What was he gonna do with it?

236
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:46,820
He does stop that. Turn people into hideous monsters. He would use the stone for that.

237
00:43:47,849 --> 00:44:13,510
The infinity stones. Use the stone for that. Cheer up. Got it. What we need to do is find

238
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:21,480
Alan's stone and dispose of it. Actually that can wait. I'm sorry I've been so caught up in

239
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:32,730
the stone I still have to get you out of there. And Naomi too. To make super mac and cheese.

240
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:44,619
But listen in spite of all our searching we haven't found your girlfriend.

241
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,949
Yeah that's right. You know what's happening. I mean I know the philosophy of stone and

242
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:58,780
all that but my girlfriend is missing. That alien. Is it some kind of mutated person that's chasing us?

243
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:13,989
Could it be? Sorry. I'm sorry. What am I saying? Good you should be. There's still the testing

244
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:22,039
ward left. That's it she must be in the testing ward. The monitor room you're in it's in the

245
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:26,920
testing ward. She's in the oh she's in the room I'm in? She's been here the whole time?

246
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,960
Naomi. What? Oh yeah she is. She's in a fucking cryogenic lab behind me. The three of us can

247
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,260
leave this place together. Go get her now. I can get to the testing ward on that elevator.

248
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:58,599
Wait for me. Save point please. Please god. If an enemy spawns right here we'll get another

249
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:06,789
cutscene too. Another one. Is there no save point? Is this the end of the game and if we

250
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:16,360
fuck up we go all the way back? There's only the testing ward left. This is it I think.

251
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,230
There's no gravity but I can use an air shooter for moving. No problem. One hp.

252
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:39,860
No save points. 27 full minutes of cutscenes. If we lose. Shredding disc on stream.

253
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:56,179
This is pretty much what it is. Can you open this case? Get. Grab it. That just gave me so much anxiety.

254
00:46:56,179 --> 00:47:14,199
Thanks. This solves the problem of zero gravity. Wait. Stop. Yep. Where's the save point? There's

255
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:38,019
no save point. Hatch three has hp. The guide says there is a there is one. If I'm getting

256
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:42,900
baited into opening up a hatch I'm looking at my own goddamn walkthrough. I don't trust

257
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:50,679
a soul here. Not in a million years right now. A million. We're talking about a million

258
00:47:50,760 --> 00:48:24,389
years. I don't trust what you guys are saying right now. There is a heal. Hatch five. Hatch five.

259
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:35,130
Run. Oh you can't run. You can just do you can just do the the uh all right.

260
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:39,449
I have to make this reference and I have to make this joke. If you haven't seen the last

261
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:44,969
jedi just delete your computer okay? Because here comes the last jedi reference. Here it

262
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:49,210
comes. So you're ready? If you haven't seen the last jedi then mute for the next 30 seconds.

263
00:48:53,349 --> 00:49:01,030
Good. You good? What does this remind you of? It's the princess Leia like thing right? With

264
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:13,539
she flying back. That's the same exact everything. All right you can you're good.

265
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:22,940
Unmute now. Read my lips. You can unmute. How is that a spoiler? Because if it that's a

266
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:49,429
major plot device there. Unmute. Yeah you're you're good. I already I gave the ultimate

267
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:53,590
star wars reference. Well I did. There are two hatches. Hatch two is straight ahead.

268
00:49:53,590 --> 00:50:10,340
Hatch five leads below. Which way should I go? Hatch five. Hatch five okay. I don't think I

269
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:19,539
can go any further. I'm turning back. Oh a heal capsule. Jerma go to hatch three.

270
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:22,500
Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three.

Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three. Jerma go to hatch three.

272
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:45,829
Which way should I go? Recover. Yes. What's the save point? I did I x out of my

273
00:50:45,829 --> 00:51:06,099

00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:57,829

285
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:49,000
thank you so much thank you so much for the 50 community subs

286
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,599
sample cases the sample case run okay quickly

287
00:53:52,599 --> 00:54:01,659
okay how much money was 50 and 50 community subs

288
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:12,389
is is five times 50 uh check glass are you talking about that

289
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:19,159
that is check sample case if you don't say which case i can't help you

290
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:24,920
check top right sample case this don't open that it's one of those

291
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,820
monsters don't open that this is evidence of

292
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:37,139
illegal experimentation all right don't open that

293
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:40,659
experiment rack one experiment rack one

294
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:49,099
okay run smash the glass and eat the monster run

295
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:53,659
quickly okay these look like test systems

296
00:54:53,659 --> 00:55:00,460
everything around this pillar fly check control panel

297
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,900
it's the panel for controlling the robotic arm at least that's what i

298
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,800
think wiggle it around and try to win the teddy bear

299
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,809
wiggle ah control panel it's a panel for controlling an experiment

300
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,730
stop grab control panel it's a panel for

301
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:23,420
controlling an experiment rack operate control panel the control

302
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,780
panel wrecking it is pointless what else

303
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,860
should i do use control panel using a huge machine

304
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:35,900
like this is way out of my league okay it's all you

305
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:46,329
it's all oh it's inoperable set to emergency mode storage boots

306
00:55:46,329 --> 00:56:01,260
the storage boots okay i can't even see any of this shit

307
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:10,840
activate do what with what check wall panel what should i check

308
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:19,420
ghost busters one ghost containing machine that's all it took let me see

309
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,860
oh i guess you exchange experiment racks using this

310
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:32,280
so the storage and extraction experiment rack okay

311
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,039
operate experiment rack experiment rack three

312
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:50,139
okay run quickly okay it's the same thing

313
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:57,929
experiment rack two experiment rack two okay

314
00:56:57,929 --> 00:57:13,590
run run run slowly oh that's not what i said

315
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:39,659
where is my walkthrough look at floating purple object

316
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:44,780
okay i'll leave no that's not what i wanted you to do

317
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:53,659
walkthrough is cheating not at this point where did you just know leave

318
00:57:53,659 --> 00:58:01,849
like she's leaving the whole place why are you doing this

319
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:05,369
no stop don't go through two different places

320
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:09,449

what are you doing stop stop stop stop stop i know you're having a lot of

322
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:17,210

00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:22,010
but listen stop what you're doing stop floating around

324
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:32,099

00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:35,380
experiment rack two okay shoe check shoe huh what are you talking about

331
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:39,079
that's a shoe up there there's nothing like that here

to see shoe okay i'll leave no stay stop yep

335
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,260
experiment rack two experiment rack two

336
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:14,809
okay run look above were they using this for animal testing

337
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:18,889
look above robot arm is it a tool for experiments

338
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:28,500
i don't really know check purple object is it a tool for experiments i don't

339
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,820
really know look up what should i check

340
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:42,389
look up at floating object the save point okay stop

341
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:46,389
stop stop stop yep experiment rack two

342
01:00:46,389 --> 01:01:02,420
experiment rack two run okay quickly okay look top left

343
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:13,190
what should i check check top left what should i check check up

344
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:20,090
what should i check what the fuck does the walkthrough say

345
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:25,690
check up up holy shit you fucking can't be serious

346
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:41,000
it's a shoe what is this i told you guys didn't know it was a shoe

347
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,800
hey can you analyze this for me how am i supposed to analyze a shoe

348
01:01:45,800 --> 01:02:01,179
leather product past inspection was naomi here

349
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:11,219
there's something like a tunnel in the back could she be beyond there

350
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:13,940
i can't get in there unless the gap is widened

351
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:28,860
what are you doing she's gonna smash your face it's an auto emergent it

352
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:34,260
can't be directly operated we need to find another way of

353
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:44,260
lowering this device all right storage boots the storage

354
01:02:44,260 --> 01:03:00,409
boots okay run quickly okay check

355
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:18,619
what should i okay check other panel check left panel

356
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:40,699
check left panel check input panel check input panel check control

357
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:48,809
device experiment rack jettison that's it

358
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:53,179
if we get rid of the experiment rack i'll be able to enter that corridor

359
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:58,659
so do it yeah it's okay the system appears to operate even in an emergency

360
01:03:58,659 --> 01:04:03,059
yeah okay let's give it a shot i feel like you're operating the machine to

361
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:10,579
scream operate to jettison experiment rack

362
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:14,019
into space the operator must enter the disengagement code number within a

363
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:37,659
set time frame hello busy mode the experiment rack

364
01:04:37,659 --> 01:04:42,139
insert the shoe in the machine the shoe was just a big key

365
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:46,389
i get it i read some numbers and you enter them

366
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:49,750
that's easy and we'll get it done in the jiffy read numbers

367
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:59,579
entering release code let's see two one oh no it's

368
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:11,349
three one four what the fuck please proceed let's see

369

01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:48,810
searching for

threat she posed to those around her i don't know where this camera is

01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:16,279
supposed to be in this space he's been your operator correct

483
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:20,600
he's been poisoned by the toxin from a mutated caterpillar

484
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:28,840
he'll surely die i'm the one who locked him in the monitor room

485
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:44,090
well it's too late to save so it was you who altered the station's orbit

486
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:52,470

02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:05,879
good game now all jokes aside it was really cool

778
02:18:05,879 --> 02:18:09,000
really fun uh except for the poor portions with it you didn't really

779
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,559
listen to you and how broken sometimes it was and

780
02:18:11,559 --> 02:18:15,530
the unskippable cutscenes i'm not gonna give it a letter grade

781
02:18:15,530 --> 02:18:18,569
but i'm gonna tell you right now if you have a playstation 2

782
02:18:18,569 --> 02:18:21,850
make sure you have the one or two specific headsets that will even work

783
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:26,649
with the game because you can't just plug in anything

784
02:18:26,649 --> 02:18:32,170
it has to be a very specific headset who's gonna buy this

785
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:43,079
i'm acting like this is a game that's on steam right now you can't just go

786
02:18:43,079 --> 02:18:50,040
get this that was a fun experience that was a

787
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:52,360
good that was a fun no no no hold on let's rephrase that that was a

788
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:59,500
good stream that was a fun super stream was it 12 13 14

789
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:03,420
about like 15 hours or so in the last 24 hours

790
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:11,340
that look at like sometimes we play these fucked up weird games

791
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:23,299
this stream doesn't happen unless this game exists it was great

792
02:19:23,299 --> 02:19:31,770
so um the purpose of today's stream last night because we went so late

793
02:19:31,770 --> 02:19:37,319
into the morning if you weren't around yesterday i

794
02:19:37,319 --> 02:19:41,750
streamed until like three or four a.m pacific

795
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:46,489
so i didn't get a whole lot of sleep and obviously i wanted to get up

796
02:19:46,489 --> 02:19:51,500
and do the irl stream so what we're gonna do and i

797
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:53,500
want to finish this game obviously too because

798
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:59,350
i just kept it going from yesterday or this this morning

799
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:09,450
end of the stream yeah so last night there was a ton of bits

800
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:12,889
and there was a lot of messages and i didn't do any of them because the

801
02:20:12,889 --> 02:20:16,729
stream was so late into the morning that what we're gonna do right now

802
02:20:16,729 --> 02:20:20,489
we're gonna just kind of relax we're gonna

803
02:20:20,569 --> 02:20:26,090

was working the night shift at mcdonald's when the first customer in

891
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:48,409
hours pulled up to the window as my headphones sputtered to life

892
02:29:48,409 --> 02:29:53,139
hey idiot see i've been dealing with anxiety issues for a while mainly

893
02:29:53,139 --> 02:29:55,620
because i'm fresh out of college and i'm stuck working the graveyard at a

894
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:58,260
fast food joint so this actually hit me pretty hard this

895
02:29:58,260 --> 02:30:01,860

whopper dummy i was taken aback not just by his

899
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:14,170
rudeness but by the slurring of words i can tell that he was either

900
02:30:14,170 --> 02:30:18,090
intoxicated or at a new new eastern new england

901
02:30:18,090 --> 02:30:21,049

shut up doofus say something funny already clown at this point there

904
02:30:28,139 --> 02:30:31,579
were tears streaming down my cheeks from the barrage of insults

905
02:30:31,579 --> 02:30:34,780
and it felt worse when i heard the laughing and another man in the car

906
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:39,260
as well as a synthesized noise coming from some sort of instrument

907
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:45,129
i couldn't handle it anymore in my current state being i just got it a

908
02:30:45,129 --> 02:30:49,049

hey i've had enough of this can you just go asshole

912
02:31:12,819 --> 02:31:16,340
as a response to this i heard boy boisterous laughter coming from the

913
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:18,819
two men and the sounds of my manager coming down

914
02:31:18,819 --> 02:31:21,940
the hall to talk to me he shoved me and took my headset

915
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:25,299
and told me to go to the second window and get ready to give them their order

916
02:31:25,299 --> 02:31:29,139
i apologized for him may i take your order after a minute or two

917
02:31:29,139 --> 02:31:33,780
and an order appeared on the screen two small coffees

918
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:38,819
two ten piece chicken wings four limited edition cheeto sauces

919
02:31:38,819 --> 02:31:42,180
i prepared their order and waited in the window and looked down through the

920
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:46,540
the drive to take a look at their car what i saw was a car smaller than

921
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:50,299
a volkswagen beetle painted white with red blue green and yellow

922
02:31:50,379 --> 02:31:54,860
spots all over it in the words german 985 emblazoned in fluorescent purple

923
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:58,299
across the hood swerving down the road hitting the

924
02:31:58,299 --> 02:32:08,250
wall multiple times in a 10-foot journey to the window

925
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:16,100
how long is this this is like a whole story the one driving

926
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:21,340
appeared to be an older man and was flushed red

927
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:46,299
hold i didn't do this this is not this is a this is a

928
02:32:46,299 --> 02:32:51,450
this is a copie pasta this is a copy posto

929
02:32:51,450 --> 02:32:54,889
hey loser the short man slurred as the passenger giggled and played the

930
02:32:54,889 --> 02:32:58,090
instrument the driver elbowed him and said hey

931
02:32:58,090 --> 02:33:01,129
was that a good one cheeto a real lol moment huh

932
02:33:01,129 --> 02:33:04,969
and the automaton played some high notes seemingly meant to signify a

933
02:33:04,969 --> 02:33:07,370
chortle he finally actually looked at me and

934
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:10,170
saw my distraught state and shrieked with laughter

935
02:33:10,170 --> 02:33:13,690
at this point i couldn't look at them and i turned away sobbing holding

936
02:33:13,690 --> 02:33:16,329
out the drink tray with their coffee and the brown paper sack

937
02:33:16,329 --> 02:33:18,409
containing their cheetos and chicken

938
02:33:18,409 --> 02:33:21,690
the older looking man had to jump out of his seat to grab and snatch the goods

939

from my tear stained hands i was still for a i was still for a

940

while until i heard their car finally drive off

941
02:33:28,409 --> 02:33:31,930
and when i finally looked forward once more i could make out a small

942
02:33:31,930 --> 02:33:34,489
card left on the counter in front of me

943
02:33:34,489 --> 02:33:38,489
through my tear clouded vision i took the slip of paper and

944
02:33:38,489 --> 02:33:41,930
locked myself in the bathroom to cry and about an hour the emotion had

945
02:33:41,930 --> 02:33:43,770
passed and my sight was clear again so i

946
02:33:43,770 --> 02:33:56,790

and tried to give me detention but then the rest of the class bullied you

1029
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:45,829
and made fun of the things you said until you stopped and i think that

1030
02:43:45,829 --> 02:43:53,719
was a metaphor for chat in my dream okay good speed by uh other than that

1033
02:44:08,139 --> 02:44:15,590

1034
02:44:15,590 --> 02:44:24,069
of the time but they're very very mean to me

1035
02:44:24,069 --> 02:44:31,379
and it makes me say the heck it's definitely more than

1036
02:44:31,379 --> 02:44:37,239
0.01 percent it's like 40 now i'm kidding somebody in chat wrote that and

1088
02:48:34,729 --> 02:48:38,819
desktop a good investment well that depends on what you mean by

1089
02:48:38,819 --> 02:48:42,860
that uh you don't have to spend 1500

1090
02:48:42,860 --> 02:48:49,100
dollars to get a gaming pc a gaming pc does not have to cost that

1091
02:48:49,100 --> 02:48:54,090
much fun you could get something that's very

1092
02:48:54,090 --> 02:49:01,100

somewhere in between like five to seven hundred bucks

1098
02:49:26,489 --> 02:49:30,620
you could you could do it somewhere under a thousand i think is you could

1099
02:49:30,620 --> 02:49:35,639
actually absolutely make it happen and don't buy expensive shit just

1100
02:49:35,639 --> 02:49:39,959
because it's expensive some of the stuff that you can buy is

1101
02:49:39,959 --> 02:49:42,760
oh yeah but it's 10 faster than the

1102
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:46,040
than the latest and greatest and it's two grand you don't that doesn't

1103
02:49:46,040 --> 02:49:51,450
matter 700 700 is really all you need somebody

1104
02:49:51,450 --> 02:49:55,450
said yeah that's really all you need unless you really are planning on

1105
02:49:55,450 --> 02:50:00,520
doing something that requires a ton of power

1106
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:04,040
like if you're doing a lot of computations

1107
02:50:04,040 --> 02:50:08,200
heavy editing heavy photo manipulation heavy video manipulation then of course

1108
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:12,440
you need a computer that can do it but if you're just playing pc games

1109
02:50:12,440 --> 02:50:16,069
and you don't care about playing at the

1110
02:50:16,069 --> 02:50:20,569
ultra ultra ultra settings and you don't care about being on like just

1111
02:50:20,569 --> 02:50:25,420
high and medium then you're fine you don't need to yeah like witcher

1112

03:04:11,139 --> 03:04:15,379
that one's like a three this is a four oh yeah yeah that's a that's like a

1257
03:04:15,379 --> 03:04:18,260
triple if this hair goes in my eye again i'm

1258
03:04:18,260 --> 03:04:20,579
going to eat it on stream i'm going to fucking pull it out i'm going to

1259
03:04:20,579 --> 03:04:33,659
consume it okay it almost happened again hey hack it

1260
03:04:33,659 --> 03:04:40,420
fast thanks for the two dollars uh bum stick a bum bum thank you

1261
03:04:40,420 --> 03:04:42,500
colonel crackers for the dollar hey germa are you going to make the

1262
03:04:42,500 --> 03:04:47,299
green screen stream a yearly stream it was an amazing stream probably not

1263
03:04:47,299 --> 03:04:53,030
i probably would want to do it once or twice not that much

1264
03:04:53,030 --> 03:04:57,219
because i feel like it loses its magic if you do it too many times

1265
03:04:57,219 --> 03:05:00,139
that's why a lot of people say oh why don't you do a do a germa rumble

1266
03:05:00,139 --> 03:05:04,120
event like every once a month or something

1267
03:05:04,120 --> 03:05:08,229
loses its flavor and it gives enough time to have

1268
03:05:08,229 --> 03:05:11,750
obviously more characters and more stuff and more references it's it's

1269
03:05:11,750 --> 03:05:15,350
better to space it out much further but

1270
03:05:15,350 --> 03:05:17,670
once a year i would really have to get in front

1271
03:05:17,670 --> 03:05:22,739
of the camera more than once because i'm not going to just put up

1272
03:05:22,739 --> 03:05:26,579
the same footage where hey yeah remember that footage i recorded

1273
03:05:26,579 --> 03:05:30,299
i'd want to get in front of the screen and do a lot more to give you

1274
03:05:30,299 --> 03:05:34,520
more to use so not with that footage no but there

1275
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:38,840
will be another night that we watch i really have to get on top of that

1276
03:05:38,840 --> 03:05:48,520
because i want it to happen soon but uh how where are we okay we are

1277
03:05:48,520 --> 03:05:54,620

03:06:20,889 --> 03:06:27,340
on these things you know i mean you know

1284
03:06:27,579 --> 03:06:31,979
you do whatever you want to do i can't tell you to do anything

1285
03:06:31,979 --> 03:06:38,440
you know i my philosophy has always been

1286
03:06:38,440 --> 03:06:41,959
you know you be the best person that you want to be

1287
03:06:41,959 --> 03:06:49,899
that's it that's it it's it's as simple as that

1288
03:06:49,899 --> 03:06:55,219
and i am not going to tell somebody how to run their life

1289
03:06:55,219 --> 03:06:59,020
you know because i wouldn't want somebody to tell me to run mine and

1290
03:06:59,500 --> 03:07:06,520
politicals uh should aside i have a lot of beliefs that are from all

1291
03:07:06,520 --> 03:07:09,079
over the political spectrum we don't talk about them because i

1292
03:07:09,079 --> 03:07:12,120
don't i don't want this to be a politics stream

1293
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:15,559
there's no i don't think there's a reason to do it because i i'd like to

1294
03:07:15,559 --> 03:07:22,229
keep this stream and this community kind of away from

1295
03:07:22,229 --> 03:07:37,559
all that not good enough oh he's such a he's such a

1296
03:07:37,559 --> 03:07:46,149
neutral no yeah we you can read between the lines here over the last few years

1297
03:07:46,149 --> 03:07:53,260
i have a lot of i think a lot of people are dynamic

1298
03:07:53,260 --> 03:08:03,399
radical centrist no you're not allowed to like everyone there's nothing to do

1299
03:08:03,399 --> 03:08:08,500
with liking everyone and everybody has their own opinions

1300
03:08:08,500 --> 03:08:11,700
and i don't need to share them i don't have to talk about them

1301
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:16,440
i don't feel like i have very many extreme positions on very much

1302
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:38,809
stream and it's slow mode please politics are polarizing

1303
03:08:38,809 --> 03:08:42,979
and that's why i don't talk about them because

1304
03:08:42,979 --> 03:08:49,510
that's not what this community is for it's not what this community is about

1305
03:08:49,510 --> 03:08:52,950
it's about us hanging out getting together and not

1306
03:08:52,950 --> 03:08:56,950
worrying about that shit for a little while world's a crazy fucking

1307
03:08:56,950 --> 03:09:04,569
place world is a crazy fucking place but

1308
03:09:04,569 --> 03:09:08,489
i'd rather us just be able to hang out and

1309
03:09:08,489 --> 03:09:18,709
have a good time so people that say what's your opinion on this what's

1310
03:09:18,709 --> 03:09:20,790
your opinion on that how do you feel about that say this say that how

1311
03:09:20,790 --> 03:09:25,989
do you feel about that it's like it's tough because i don't want i don't

1312
03:09:25,989 --> 03:09:30,549
want a bunch of people to you know using certain things that i

1313
03:09:30,549 --> 03:09:33,750
say as examples to not want to listen to what i have to say not

1314
03:09:33,750 --> 03:09:36,549
want to like me don't want to talk to me don't want to listen to

1315
03:09:36,549 --> 03:09:40,469
my streams oh now fuck that guy he said that fuck him

1316
03:09:40,469 --> 03:10:01,739
i'd rather just remove it entirely at least in this space

1317
03:10:01,739 --> 03:10:04,059
if you wanted to have a private conversation with me about something

1318
03:10:04,059 --> 03:10:07,579
like that you know so be it right like i've had

1319
03:10:07,579 --> 03:10:12,149
private conversations before with some people in this community about

1320
03:10:12,149 --> 03:10:16,389
you know political stuff before but not in like a form like this

1321
03:10:16,389 --> 03:10:24,860
which is why that jokey but also very serious

1322
03:10:24,860 --> 03:10:28,459
uh i don't we don't talk about politics on the stream is still there

1323
03:10:28,459 --> 03:10:34,659
i feel like people are trying to bait germa into talking politics so they

1324
03:10:34,659 --> 03:10:40,540
can meme about it at his expense no i don't i don't think so i think

1325
03:10:40,540 --> 03:10:52,379
everything's just fine and even if they are then that's

1326
03:10:52,379 --> 03:10:58,940
okay it doesn't because i i'm not i'm not going to give

1327
03:10:58,940 --> 03:11:02,379
i'm not going to give any there's not going to be a stream where i sit up

1328
03:11:02,379 --> 03:11:05,579
here and i talk about let me tell you this and let me tell you

1329
03:11:05,579 --> 03:11:14,700
that because that's not how i am anyways what is the camera resolution

1330
03:11:14,700 --> 03:11:24,440
very bad i've never gotten the vibe that the chat is malicious and it's

1331
03:11:24,440 --> 03:11:38,780
trolling no i don't think so either but to close the book on that we

1332
03:11:38,780 --> 03:11:47,579
don't even need to open it at least here uh resident evil 2 on

1333
03:11:47,579 --> 03:11:51,370

1334
03:11:51,370 --> 03:12:06,149

1335
03:12:06,149 --> 03:12:14,860
i'm not gonna i'll say a few things but not anything to i'm not going to

minutes i think it's the reason why there's

1343
03:12:58,950 --> 03:13:01,430
such a long slow mode right now is because

1344
03:13:01,430 --> 03:13:11,979

1562
03:33:32,010 --> 03:33:34,889
this game's plot is so asinine is because they never expected anyone to

1584
03:35:19,559 --> 03:35:25,909
you guys if it doesn't happen to you guys i'm sure it does

1585
03:35:25,909 --> 03:35:29,590
when i like sit on a computer screen and more than like two or three

1586
03:35:29,590 --> 03:35:32,950
hours go by i feel like like my i like my eyes

1587
03:35:32,950 --> 03:35:38,870
start to water and even when i take break and i you know throw some

1588
03:35:38,950 --> 03:35:41,190
water on my face and just hang out it's like

1589
03:35:41,190 --> 03:35:44,549
it's annoying i need to get like gamer goggles

1590
03:35:44,549 --> 03:35:54,620
you might need to turn down your brightness i think it's actually pretty

1591
03:35:54,620 --> 03:35:58,309
low it's like on the 30 to 40 percent side it's not

1592
03:35:58,309 --> 03:36:02,069
that high i don't think maybe i'll try that i'll get gamer goggles and i'll

1593
03:36:02,069 --> 03:36:04,709
turn the brightness down like another 10 percent and see if that helps

1594
03:36:04,709 --> 03:36:08,950
because sometimes it's just like i have really sensitive eyes though

1595
03:36:08,950 --> 03:36:13,319
anyways if i go outside in the wind for even five seconds but there's a

1596
03:36:13,319 --> 03:36:16,700
little breeze of wind and it hits my face

1597
03:36:16,700 --> 03:36:21,260
what tears just stream down my cheeks it looks bad it looks like i'm just

1598
03:36:21,260 --> 03:36:28,200
crying streaming down my face i walk into like a like a coffee

1599
03:36:28,200 --> 03:36:31,620
shop or something out of the wind and it's like

1600
03:36:31,620 --> 03:36:35,299

1601
03:36:35,299 --> 03:36:45,290

you for watching i'm glad that you enjoyed this stream

1610
03:37:21,829 --> 03:37:25,190
as much as you enjoyed that stream which is arguably

1611
03:37:25,190 --> 03:37:27,829
one of my favorite times sitting in this chair

1612
03:37:27,829 --> 03:37:33,049
the sims 4 mod streams especially the first one was probably the

1613
03:37:33,049 --> 03:37:36,489
the most fun i've ever had sitting in a chair with a game

1614
03:37:36,489 --> 03:37:41,780
probably talking about tears streaming down my face that

1615
03:37:41,780 --> 03:37:47,670
happened that actually happened during that stream

1616
03:37:47,670 --> 03:37:51,350
i will never be able to replicate or replace how fun that stream was

1617
03:37:51,350 --> 03:37:55,190
but you can do other things we got a lot of other plans so don't worry

1618
03:37:55,190 --> 03:37:59,719
don't worry but thanks for the one dollar thank you dork cube for the

1619
03:37:59,719 --> 03:38:04,760

thank you good luck much love to you wow epic gamer

1645
03:39:52,649 --> 03:39:55,530
what that's what's wrong with epic gamer

1646
03:39:55,530 --> 03:40:00,860
i'll take the title of epic gamer that's fine

1647
03:40:00,860 --> 03:40:04,780
i can't wear germa shirts what if i'm associated what

1648
03:40:04,780 --> 03:40:09,899
what if you do crimes if you commit a crime with my t-shirt on they're

1649
03:40:09,899 --> 03:40:12,379
not going to think that i committed the crime too

1650
03:40:12,379 --> 03:40:18,020
it's like there he is he robbed a bank and he's wearing a metallica shirt

1651
03:40:18,020 --> 03:40:22,219
go arrest metallica too they must have had something to do with this

1652
03:40:22,219 --> 03:40:39,559
he told don't stop that stop it uh thank you soys awc for the three

1653
03:40:39,559 --> 03:40:41,979
bucks hey germa you're a genius when it

1654
03:40:41,979 --> 03:40:44,860
comes to entertaining me i want you to be part of a major

1655
03:40:44,860 --> 03:40:48,969
decision in my life okay and i want to quit this job

1656
03:40:48,969 --> 03:40:51,209
because i'm not respected for my hard work

1657
03:40:51,290 --> 03:40:56,420
input and input because i refuse to twiddle my thumbs just to clock in hours

1658
03:40:56,420 --> 03:41:04,340
i'm carrying this project but we're probably getting none of the credit

1659
03:41:04,340 --> 03:41:09,979
well want me to be a part of a major decision what's the decision

1660
03:41:09,979 --> 03:41:21,190
to stop working on the project or quitting or leaving or should you stay

1661
03:41:21,190 --> 03:41:27,799
or should you leave um there's a there's a couple of

1662
03:41:27,799 --> 03:41:34,629
scenarios i'm not a professional when it comes to stuff like this but

1663
03:41:34,629 --> 03:41:38,709
i would say if you're not happy what you're doing and you're putting in a

1664
03:41:38,709 --> 03:41:41,989
lot of work and you're not getting what you think

1665
03:41:41,989 --> 03:41:44,309
out what you should be getting out of it

1666
03:41:44,309 --> 03:41:47,510
then you need to start kind of looking for something else something

1667
03:41:47,510 --> 03:41:49,909
maybe try looking for another job try looking for another place in the

1668
03:41:49,909 --> 03:41:56,889
same field and if you're able to you know get

1669
03:41:56,889 --> 03:42:00,409
a job and leave the one you're currently at now that's way easier said

1670
03:42:00,409 --> 03:42:04,540
than done i know that and i understand that

1671
03:42:04,540 --> 03:42:08,459
but you don't want to put yourself into a position where you

1672
03:42:08,459 --> 03:42:12,620
are going to essentially regret what you did you know if you quit your job today

1673
03:42:12,620 --> 03:42:16,299
and you're like fuck this place i'm out of here and then i'm going to

1674
03:42:16,299 --> 03:42:19,180
go look for something if you can't find something then you

1675
03:42:19,180 --> 03:42:22,219
don't you got to be careful are you financially able to do that maybe you

1676
03:42:22,219 --> 03:42:24,940
are if you are financially able to do that

1677
03:42:24,940 --> 03:42:27,659
maybe that is something that you want to do it really depends on your

1678
03:42:27,659 --> 03:42:33,319
specific scenario but unless you have a lot of money

1679
03:42:33,319 --> 03:42:38,950
i don't think that's a great idea personally i would say the route of

1680
03:42:38,950 --> 03:42:42,229
looking for to interview other places and looking to find other stuff to do

1681
03:42:42,229 --> 03:42:46,229
while you're still working and then once you know that you've got a

1682
03:42:46,229 --> 03:42:50,069
solid lead and you're going to be able to work somewhere else

1683
03:42:50,069 --> 03:42:54,420
maybe go through on that route instead it's

1684
03:42:54,420 --> 03:42:58,569
it's rough there's no real correct answer here i don't think

1685
03:42:58,569 --> 03:43:02,090
because everybody's so different and everybody has such wildly different

1686
03:43:02,090 --> 03:43:05,850
lives and jobs and i don't know how essentially you

1687
03:43:05,850 --> 03:43:09,209
are as an employee to this project and if you leave are you

1688
03:43:09,209 --> 03:43:12,729
negatively affecting other people i don't know i don't know that's for you to

1689
03:43:12,729 --> 03:43:22,700
decide but the safest route is is definitely

1690
03:43:22,700 --> 03:43:28,180
to try to find something else that's great don't jump from the

1691
03:43:28,180 --> 03:43:30,979
plane without a parachute that is a great point yes that is pretty much

1692
03:43:30,979 --> 03:43:41,620
exactly what we're talking about that's just my opinion and that's just

1693
03:43:41,620 --> 03:43:46,979
the way that i see things other people might see it differently but

1694
03:43:46,979 --> 03:43:52,629
got to think about the future you do but i wish you the best of luck

1695
03:43:52,629 --> 03:43:55,510
sorry to hear about the hardships at work hopefully you get it figured out

1910
04:07:00,620 --> 04:07:04,459
lately lately i feel like i don't really have a purpose

1911
04:07:04,459 --> 04:07:07,659
in life other than just to live and be there for other people either that or

1912
04:07:07,659 --> 04:07:10,299
i'm just living for dreams and opportunities that i

1913
04:07:10,299 --> 04:07:13,180
know are never going to happen but i keep giving it a chance as an

1914
04:07:13,180 --> 04:07:15,899
excuse to live longer it's just so many

1915
04:07:15,899 --> 04:07:18,620
expectations and pressure from other people and i don't know what to do

1916
04:07:18,620 --> 04:07:21,180
with my own life and that's on top of depression so

1917
04:07:21,180 --> 04:07:26,219
much other shit and that says one out of two i will

1918
04:07:26,219 --> 04:07:31,239
tell you very very very much i mentioned uh lobster five community

1919
04:07:31,239 --> 04:07:35,000
subs thank you i mentioned something uh not even five

1920
04:07:35,000 --> 04:07:37,879
ten minutes ago about if 18 year old me could look into the

1921
04:07:37,879 --> 04:07:41,879
future they would think it was a lie um the

1922
04:07:41,879 --> 04:07:46,420
thing about opportunity is you never you never know when it's

1923
04:07:46,420 --> 04:07:48,819
going to happen the reason why it is why it is called

1924
04:07:48,819 --> 04:07:52,120
opportunity is because it could just fucking happen and

1925
04:07:52,120 --> 04:07:56,139
you'll never know you just you just try to be ready for it

1926
04:07:56,139 --> 04:07:59,739
it doesn't matter if you're talking about something in work or relationship

1927
04:07:59,739 --> 04:08:04,280
or school there's there's no real way to

1928
04:08:04,280 --> 04:08:09,399
to prepare for it i was not prepared for it i was not ready for it

1929
04:08:09,399 --> 04:08:14,729
i was just like a lot of you fucking guys

1930
04:08:14,729 --> 04:08:19,540
all of you guys when i was like 18 19 20 i'd you know you just kind of

1931
04:08:19,540 --> 04:08:22,180
you're just doing you you're trying to figure out what you want to do

1932
04:08:22,180 --> 04:08:24,739
into your 20s into your 30s you're just trying to figure out what the

1933
04:08:24,739 --> 04:08:31,670
fuck you want to do and sometimes an opportunity will knock

1934
04:08:31,670 --> 04:08:34,389
and you just happen to do it and you can't really foresee that it's going

1935
04:08:34,389 --> 04:08:39,319
to happen but on top of that though there there

1936
04:08:39,319 --> 04:08:43,420
is no secret formula i i think people will ask well how

1937
04:08:43,420 --> 04:08:45,979
do you do this how do you do that what's the secret what's the what

1938
04:08:45,979 --> 04:08:50,659
there really is no secret it's just kind of uh

1939
04:08:50,659 --> 04:08:56,420
passion a little a little bit of uh talent in the right areas a lot of

1940
04:08:56,420 --> 04:08:58,819
luck you know that's what opportunity really

1941
04:08:58,819 --> 04:09:04,180
kind of is is those a handful of things and

1942
04:09:04,180 --> 04:09:09,190
i really wish there was a way for me to

1943
04:09:09,190 --> 04:09:12,149
tell you all the secrets and give you all these things and hey let me

1944
04:09:12,149 --> 04:09:14,389
tell you this this is the exact thing you have to do

1945
04:09:14,389 --> 04:09:22,299
with your life but i can't do that you know i can't uh i i can't give

1946
04:09:22,299 --> 04:09:25,850
you the answers because i don't have them

1947
04:09:25,850 --> 04:09:33,459
as much as uh yeah life is very complex

1948
04:09:33,459 --> 04:09:41,690
but to put a cap on something like that try to find a few things that you

1949
04:09:41,690 --> 04:09:44,809
like to do a few things that you're good at

1950
04:09:44,809 --> 04:09:50,700
and just make your life however you can from those handful of

1951
04:09:50,700 --> 04:09:53,959
things everybody's good at something everybody's

1952
04:09:53,959 --> 04:09:57,159
good at fucking something you just might not know what it is

1953
04:09:57,159 --> 04:10:12,739
yet and even if you do work on it all the time a lot of

1954
04:10:12,739 --> 04:10:14,819
people say i'm not good at anything

1955
04:10:14,819 --> 04:10:18,500
you yes you are there's at least a handful of things that you could

1956
04:10:18,500 --> 04:10:24,149
reliably do that you know that you can and if you don't if you really don't

1957
04:10:24,149 --> 04:10:29,530
think you do you might try to take up some more

1958
04:10:29,530 --> 04:10:32,409
hobbies try to take up some more things that you might want to try to

1959
04:10:32,409 --> 04:10:45,190
get better at i wish i had the secrets everybody's good at something

1960

well that shirt you put on during the new year's stream the fireman

2263
04:43:46,970 --> 04:43:48,970
shirt would that ever be some kind of merch

2264
04:43:48,970 --> 04:43:52,889
i'd absolutely wear that in public the shirt is currently purchasable from

2265
04:43:52,889 --> 04:43:57,349
the jackbox uh app thing it's like a website

2266
04:43:57,750 --> 04:44:02,229
as for fireman merch everything is a possibility

2267
04:44:02,229 --> 04:44:07,029
but i really don't want to load up a shitload of shirt like for instance it

2268
04:44:07,029 --> 04:44:11,529
was like three or four shirts oh yeah hey by the way tomorrow it's

2269
04:44:11,529 --> 04:44:14,729
20 bucks a shirt and it's like five of them like i

2270
04:44:14,729 --> 04:44:17,610
don't i'd rather trickle out stuff like that

2271
04:44:17,610 --> 04:44:21,369
and not just dump out like three or four pieces of merchandise at once

2272
04:44:21,369 --> 04:44:25,290

i don't want there to be any incentives for subbing

2303
04:46:54,700 --> 04:46:59,099
while chat was in sub only mode well chat goes into sub only mode

2304
04:46:59,099 --> 04:47:02,459
sometimes when there's a problem or there's a there's a reason for it to

2305
04:47:02,459 --> 04:47:06,139
go on it's not on it's on maybe for a couple minutes

2306
04:47:06,139 --> 04:47:10,700
maybe um sub only mode is as is like a way

2307
04:47:10,700 --> 04:47:14,540
to potentially help or corral when

2308
04:47:14,540 --> 04:47:19,900
there's like an issue it's not you know paying to

2309
04:47:19,900 --> 04:47:23,740
the chat is open almost 100 percent of the time so

2310
04:47:23,740 --> 04:47:27,580
uh that's not going to happen i'm not going to turn on sub only mode

2311
04:47:27,580 --> 04:47:30,540
forever it's it's just only there for very specific

2373
04:52:47,049 --> 04:52:50,569
dollar this is chump change right here don't say that but what you don't know

2374
04:52:50,569 --> 04:52:53,450
is i'm almost at a hundred dollars donated you see i didn't give it all

2375
04:52:53,450 --> 04:52:55,770
at once i've broken it down into a ton of

2376
04:52:55,770 --> 04:53:04,500
messages germa iq yeah i mean no one's expected to

2377
04:53:04,500 --> 04:53:09,180
fucking just give that much money in that short amount of time

2378
04:53:10,389 --> 04:53:17,419
tons of you guys have given like ten five dollars dollar two dollars

2379
04:53:17,419 --> 04:53:22,310
every single stream it adds up a lot it adds up over time to a point where

2380
04:53:22,310 --> 04:53:25,189
you you have given potentially hundreds of

2381
04:53:25,189 --> 04:53:38,389
dollars over the years bottom left what's in the bottom

2382
04:53:38,389 --> 04:53:45,610
left pillow with duct tape on it yeah if

2383
04:53:45,610 --> 04:53:47,369
you're just if you're just joining us we

2384
04:53:47,369 --> 04:53:52,709
i finished um lifeline and there were a lot of messages and a lot of bits

2385
04:53:52,709 --> 04:53:56,229
and stuff that i didn't read from yesterday and i'm just kind of

2386
04:53:56,229 --> 04:53:59,990
going through the massive amount of bits and

2387
04:53:59,990 --> 04:54:03,590
subs and donations that were given over the last 48 hours so

2388
04:54:03,590 --> 04:54:08,099
we're just kind of hanging up for a while just chilling up what chat am i

2389
04:54:08,099 --> 04:54:18,459
reading from the what are we talking about hangout

2390
04:54:18,459 --> 04:54:22,459
stream i too like to hang out with my friends by watching us shower money

2391
04:54:22,459 --> 04:54:28,169
on one lucky friend for five hours straight

2392
04:54:28,169 --> 04:54:37,099
well two because we i beat i beat the lifeline i beat lifeline at about three

2393
04:54:37,099 --> 04:54:46,569
and a half to four hours in sounds like my kind of party my three

2394
04:54:46,569 --> 04:54:50,939
thousand friends watching watching us give one person

2395
04:54:50,939 --> 04:54:57,610
money um but this doesn't happen that often

2396
04:54:57,610 --> 04:55:01,290
this is this is an anomaly for sure this is a lot of fucking money

2397
04:55:01,290 --> 04:55:03,849
and a lot of messages over the last couple of days this

2398
04:55:03,849 --> 04:55:06,869
does not happen all the time so i obviously want to give the

2399
04:55:06,869 --> 04:55:14,419
attention that i think it deserves but we'll we are getting we're getting

2400
04:55:14,419 --> 04:55:18,659
there not very much left not like a it's probably not going to

2401
04:55:18,659 --> 04:55:23,319
take more than an hour or so but this is also another conversation

2402
04:55:23,319 --> 04:55:29,500
to have because a part of me does not want to

2403
04:55:29,500 --> 04:55:35,830
have this conversation but kind of have to at some point

2404
04:55:35,830 --> 04:55:40,220
if remember how when we it used to be

2405
04:55:40,220 --> 04:55:43,740
it was 25 cents and i would read everything

2406
04:55:43,740 --> 04:55:48,139
right and then we move that to a dollar and i'm still trying to read as much as

2407
04:55:48,139 --> 04:55:53,349
i can what happens is when there's so many

2408
04:55:53,349 --> 04:55:56,709
people giving money and so many people

2409
04:55:56,709 --> 04:56:02,630
donating and it becomes it becomes hard to do this

2410
04:56:02,630 --> 04:56:08,580
with a channel that is growing at the size that we are

2411
04:56:08,580 --> 04:56:12,439
so with a one dollar minimum it actually

2412
04:56:12,439 --> 04:56:15,720
as much as i don't want to say this and i'm not really i'm not sure

2413
04:56:15,799 --> 04:56:23,430
ready to do it yet the threshold may have to increase

2414
04:56:23,430 --> 04:56:28,520
it might have to for the end of the streams

2415
04:56:28,520 --> 04:56:34,139
50 dollar minimum what the hell are you talking about no way

2416
04:56:34,139 --> 04:56:37,590
i wanted to wait as long as i could i wanted to see how

2417
04:56:37,590 --> 04:56:47,060
how far it could go but when there's when there's this many people it just

2418
04:56:47,060 --> 04:56:52,040
it becomes nearly impossible you know sometimes the end of the

2419
04:56:52,040 --> 04:56:54,840
streams will be two three plus potentially hours long

2420
04:56:54,840 --> 04:57:01,930
and that's why we moved it in the first place

2421
04:57:01,930 --> 04:57:09,619
10 to 15 dollars no no it wouldn't be that high

2422
04:57:09,619 --> 04:57:18,340
it would it would not be more than that not no not in a million years

2423
04:57:18,340 --> 04:57:22,459
but it just that's just kind of what happens when

2424
04:57:22,459 --> 04:57:26,619
there's this much to read and i want to give everybody the attention that

2425
04:57:26,619 --> 04:57:31,369
they deserve but the stream needs to function too

2426
04:57:31,369 --> 04:57:34,490
that's been one of my biggest philosophies with doing streaming and

2427
04:57:34,490 --> 04:57:40,389
twitch and everything is having a stream that is a stream

2428
04:57:40,389 --> 04:57:45,180
and that's why i stopped reading stuff in the middle of the streams that's why

2429
04:57:45,180 --> 04:57:47,900
i moved it to the end so we could kind of have a little session where we hang

2430
04:57:47,900 --> 04:57:52,419
out and i'm gonna think about what it would

2431
04:57:52,419 --> 04:57:58,360
possibly be i need to buy the season pass no it's

2432
04:57:58,360 --> 04:58:01,479
just for um end of the stream messages to make

2433
04:58:01,479 --> 04:58:04,840
it easier for us to read them so it doesn't potentially go on for hours at

2434
04:58:04,840 --> 04:58:13,930
a time like that fucking sound but for the

2435
04:58:13,930 --> 04:58:24,119
purposes of uh this stream the one guy vip dlc

2436
04:58:24,119 --> 04:58:33,479
no let's keep going just figured i would bring it up

2437
04:58:33,479 --> 04:58:37,189
and sort of keeping that in here for a while

2438
04:58:37,189 --> 04:58:39,349
because i didn't want to really talk about it because i didn't want to bring

2439
04:58:39,349 --> 04:58:45,209
it up because i didn't want to do it but sometimes it's necessary as much as

2440
04:58:45,209 --> 04:58:49,830
it pains me to say but thank you kill ganon uh for the

as to what you can do it's impossible

2614
05:12:04,060 --> 05:12:08,860
you just have to pick one and just go and see what happens

2615
05:12:08,860 --> 05:12:16,119
that's a great way to put it sometimes just pick one and just go

money to help people in need yeah i've i've thought about charity

2680
05:17:15,099 --> 05:17:18,700
nights before and how to run them and how to make them

2681
05:17:18,700 --> 05:17:24,569
work i think of uh years ago the once a year you know the tip of

2682
05:17:24,569 --> 05:17:29,450
the hats was always something that i wanted to be a part of uh but

2683
05:17:29,450 --> 05:17:36,950
probably that is a nice idea yeah i would want to have that logistically

2684
05:17:36,950 --> 05:17:41,909
make sense right because uh pretty much like i said

2685
05:17:41,909 --> 05:17:45,349
once a year or so i would be part of somebody else's

2686
05:17:45,349 --> 05:17:49,270
stream or somebody else's event or charity event and i would kind of go

2687
05:17:49,270 --> 05:17:55,860
and or do or show up and promote and um but not nothing just like

2688
05:17:55,860 --> 05:17:58,900
personally for me in this stream in this community it's always been

2689
05:17:58,979 --> 05:18:05,369
something else or somebody else's uh event but i'll do some research on that

2690
05:18:05,369 --> 05:18:12,490
figure what i'd want to do and take a lot of time to research

2691
05:18:12,490 --> 05:18:14,889
charities though a lot of actually kind of shady

2692
05:18:14,889 --> 05:18:19,049
yeah that's another thing too is it's hard i i'm not the greatest on

2693
05:18:19,049 --> 05:18:21,689
trying to pick stuff out like that that's why i've always

2694
05:18:21,689 --> 05:18:25,130
felt more comfortable supporting ones that people have already done the

2695
05:18:25,130 --> 05:18:31,400
research on so and maybe it would be another

2696
05:18:31,400 --> 05:18:34,040
thing where i would just support another one and be on another

2697
05:18:34,040 --> 05:18:37,479
event stream or do something like that rather than my own

2698
05:18:37,479 --> 05:18:46,279
but i do agree how um how just how generous this community is

2699
05:18:46,279 --> 05:18:54,520
it's very very very generous but something to think about for sure

2700
05:18:54,520 --> 05:18:57,159
let's move on to thin rue for one dollar hey jerma i used to think i

05:20:04,060 --> 05:20:07,580

there's a couple avenues to catch up with if you if you feel the need to

2716
05:20:21,979 --> 05:20:25,099
there is the second channel which has obviously

2717
05:20:25,099 --> 05:20:29,020
edited highlights there's the archive channel that is independently run that

2718
05:20:29,020 --> 05:20:31,020
i don't have really anything to do with but

2719
05:20:31,020 --> 05:20:37,180
is independently uploading archives nobody can make it to every stream

2720
05:20:37,180 --> 05:20:41,900
it's a lot of time even like a five six hour stream like this one is going to

2721
05:20:41,900 --> 05:20:44,380
be it's a very significant portion of

2793
05:26:07,560 --> 05:26:09,880
semester i can already tell it's gonna be tough

2794
05:26:09,880 --> 05:26:12,840
i was late to my second class and my computer science professor spoke

2795
05:26:12,840 --> 05:26:15,799
condescendingly to the whole class because none of us were taught a

2796
05:26:15,799 --> 05:26:18,599
specific part of coding in the previous course

2797
05:26:18,599 --> 05:26:21,959
then when i got home i had to do 20 sketches for my art class

2798
05:26:21,959 --> 05:26:24,439
so when i saw you streaming i literally jumped out of my chair and

2799
05:26:24,439 --> 05:26:29,939
yelled yes i can't imagine i have that kind of

2800
05:26:29,939 --> 05:26:34,020
effect on you and i'm happy i'm happy that you do i'm happy i do

2801
05:26:34,020 --> 05:26:45,750
stick with it it can be fucking tough thank you so much for being around

bit donation i felt awful about it so i will spend more money

3039
05:46:19,700 --> 05:46:24,599
but i'm an old tf2 fan and was a fan ever since is there a way to

3040
05:46:24,599 --> 05:46:28,360
private message you if not i understand it just really wanted to know

3041
05:46:28,360 --> 05:46:30,840
how much you really helped me through the years i just don't like have any

3042
05:46:30,840 --> 05:46:33,159
money for bit donations i'm sorry about that don't

3043
05:46:33,159 --> 05:46:36,759
don't apologize for giving me money but

3044
05:46:36,759 --> 05:46:40,439
i don't do private message i don't have dms open or anything like that i

3045
05:46:40,439 --> 05:46:44,279
don't because it can get overwhelming it can

3046
05:46:44,279 --> 05:46:49,319
get very overwhelming and instead of focusing on this stream

3047
05:46:49,319 --> 05:46:53,610
and this collective gathering of stuff to do

3048
05:46:53,610 --> 05:47:01,479
it's i don't i i don't read i can't it's it's it's it's too much and then

3049
05:47:01,479 --> 05:47:04,360
if you know let's say a bunch of people want to talk to me or ask me

3050
05:47:04,360 --> 05:47:07,400
things and then i add they i give them a response and then i you

3051
05:47:07,400 --> 05:47:10,279
know a couple days go by maybe i don't respond and i'm doing

3052
05:47:10,279 --> 05:47:13,400
something else it's just it's too much i can't spread

3053
05:47:13,400 --> 05:47:22,409
myself that thin so because i know the kind of person

3054
05:47:22,409 --> 05:47:26,549
that i am and that bill bow baggins quote

3055
05:47:26,549 --> 05:47:31,830
spreading yourself too thin um like butter on toast

3056
05:47:31,830 --> 05:47:34,790
toast ends up being fucking disgusting and you don't want to eat it anymore

3057
05:47:34,790 --> 05:47:39,610
gandalf but thank you i really appreciate the

3058
05:47:39,610 --> 05:47:42,090
fact that you'd even want to talk to me in the first place

3059
05:47:42,090 --> 05:47:46,700
demonic cucumber one dollar it's a meme read the comments

3060
05:47:46,700 --> 05:47:51,290
yeah but here okay here's the thing about i don't i don't want to like

3061
05:47:51,290 --> 05:47:54,490
brigade a post that just maybe doesn't belong

3062
05:47:54,490 --> 05:47:58,250
you know what i mean i can't like officially condone something

3063
05:47:58,250 --> 05:48:04,380
that maybe somebody's doing on like a website you know what i mean

3064
05:48:04,380 --> 05:48:20,139
that's maybe doesn't necessarily it's just the germa craft uh it's just the

3065
05:48:20,139 --> 05:48:35,189
germa craft intro these comments yeah i i don't

3066
05:48:35,189 --> 05:48:39,290
because here's the thing i i don't want it's it's that's funny

3067
05:48:39,290 --> 05:48:44,919
it is but i also don't want to i i'm not sure what that way if that

3068
05:48:44,919 --> 05:48:48,860
website is a um i'm not sure what that website is

3069
05:48:48,860 --> 05:48:52,060
i've never really gone to it but i don't want to make

3070
05:48:52,060 --> 05:48:55,580
like a funny joke about you know a place where people maybe

3071
05:48:55,580 --> 05:48:58,939
put stuff where they lose loved ones and you know i that's

3072
05:48:58,939 --> 05:49:03,450
that that doesn't really sit that you know what i mean so i don't

3073
05:49:03,450 --> 05:49:06,650
want that to necessarily be something that i say oh yeah

3074
05:49:06,650 --> 05:49:16,680
look it out you know i'm saying it's funny in our

3075
05:49:16,680 --> 05:49:19,720
it's funny in our context here because we know

3076
05:49:19,720 --> 05:49:24,220
we know we're in we have the joke here but

3077
05:49:24,220 --> 05:49:27,740
i don't want to cause a problem for somebody else i don't want to cause

3078
05:49:27,740 --> 05:49:31,830
an issue or it i like to stay away from that kind of stuff

3079
05:49:31,830 --> 05:49:37,000
so it's funny it is funny because like we

3080
05:49:37,000 --> 05:49:43,689
like i said we know what it is but you understand

3081
05:49:43,689 --> 05:49:49,290
interesting stuff and then finally at the end here we've got

3082
05:49:49,290 --> 05:49:57,400
here we go ready last few uh we've got dark angel for one dollar getting

3083
05:49:57,400 --> 05:49:59,319
late ps i would love to become an active

3084
05:49:59,319 --> 05:50:03,380
streamer like you starting out reading every donations they won't have many

3085
05:50:03,380 --> 05:50:07,299
uh fans to begin with as you did transferring from youtube do you think

3086
05:50:07,299 --> 05:50:10,419
being a twitch streamer is a stable job with enough stop you right there

3087
05:50:10,419 --> 05:50:19,500
i'm gonna stop you right there very important you cannot go into a new

3088
05:50:19,500 --> 05:50:25,180
venture like this with the idea of money being there

3089
05:50:25,180 --> 05:50:30,340
that's not it is i think that is the absolute wrong way to do this

3090
05:50:30,340 --> 05:50:36,869
it's not a stable job it's not something to go into

3091
05:50:36,869 --> 05:50:39,430
hey that's what i'm gonna do for work and that's what i'm gonna do for

3092
05:50:39,430 --> 05:50:43,750
money that's that's that's a that's not the best attitude to have here

3093
05:50:43,750 --> 05:50:48,549
you have to do it and do it because you want to do it because you

3094
05:50:48,549 --> 05:50:51,669
want to not because you want something from it you know what i mean

3095
05:50:51,669 --> 05:50:54,470
you don't money i'm talking monetarily you

3096
05:50:54,470 --> 05:50:57,189
can't go into it thinking it's a job

3097
05:50:57,189 --> 05:51:00,630
because it requires other people to watch to for it to become

3098
05:51:00,630 --> 05:51:06,259
a job so as long as you have an attitude that's not

3099
05:51:06,259 --> 05:51:13,299
there is money but just germa took it all but if you said i was good

3100
05:51:13,299 --> 05:51:18,020
at something never do it for free yeah but you can't have that mentality

3101
05:51:18,020 --> 05:51:27,029
when you start out if you have a goal a monetary goal

3102
05:51:27,029 --> 05:51:31,290
that is let's say a stable income from twitch

3103
05:51:31,290 --> 05:51:35,130
you are preparing you are setting you're setting yourself up for

3104
05:51:35,130 --> 05:51:38,009
disappointment because if you don't get to that

3105
05:51:38,009 --> 05:51:42,380
point that you want to get to that that's a problem because that i

3106
05:51:42,380 --> 05:51:45,819
wanted to do this for work but that's not how it works you

3107
05:51:46,619 --> 05:51:53,610
you can't go into it like that whatever whoever wants to stream if you want to

3108
05:51:53,610 --> 05:51:56,259
be a streamer and you want to be a youtuber

3109
05:51:56,259 --> 05:51:59,779
good fucking luck to you i hope you make great content i hope you put out

3110
05:51:59,779 --> 05:52:02,099
stuff that you're proud of that you think is interesting

3111
05:52:02,099 --> 05:52:06,020
but you can't go into it with the mindset of this is my job

3112
05:52:06,020 --> 05:52:11,159
and i'm gonna do this for money it's i think it's it's it's an attitude

3113
05:52:11,159 --> 05:52:24,419
you have to leave at the door bro luck money but good luck uh
