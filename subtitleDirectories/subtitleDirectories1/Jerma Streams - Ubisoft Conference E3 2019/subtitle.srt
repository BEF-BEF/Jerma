1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:21,210
Come on, we ain't doing an intro. No intro. I'm not late. I'm not late. This is the previews

2
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,859
for the movie. You can go to a movie 25 minutes late and still catch the first two minutes.

3
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:32,210
I haven't gone to a movie on time in fucking my whole life. Yeah, I sound a little froggy.

4
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:39,119
It's because I got some schnapps up there. I'll be alright though. C3, babe. Come on.

5
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:54,420
I'm gonna make a tweet. Hold on. Well, that is not what I said. The lights aren't

6
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,259
even turned on in here. That's how you know it's a fucking dire situation right now. We've

7
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:09,500
got like five, ten minutes. I need to write something. What do I write here? Day two.

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:18,989
Is it day two? It's day two, right? Why is the outro playing? Here, listen to them.

9
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:28,030
They're probably talking about fucking- Oh, brain froze. I'm doing two things at once.

10
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:37,790
Let's go. Day two. E3. Now, it looks like you've got a pretty special avatar there.

11
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:44,189
I'm gonna put my phone away. It's just like a movie.

12
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:51,829
Now, it looks like we just entered a station. Tell us a little bit

13
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:56,030
about what's going on here. We're on the tour regarding education. Now,

14
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:05,829
alright. Hey, how are you? Good to see you again. What is it historically after?

15
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:12,629
Is this another Assassin's Creed? I love how Assassin's Creed puts history into the game.

16
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:20,229
I'm trying to listen. You're not trying.

17
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,389
Quiz? Yeah, so I hope you've been paying attention. Let's go for one easy question, right?

18
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:43,710
I saw the Twitch tweet, by the way. They took that moment from yesterday.

19
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:55,460
That's like on the official Twitter now. It was not even a funny joke.

20
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,060
People probably looking at that tweet going like, oh, this is what the

21
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:08,740
kind of streams he has? His stream must suck. It was me covering up Keanu Reeves' head

22
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:15,460
and pointing. I was like an asshole. I was obnoxious. That's not me. This is me.

23
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:23,169
I'm a good guy. Well, thank you so much for joining us today and telling us a little bit

24
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,969
about the Discovery Tour and a huge shout out to the team at Ubisoft Quebec for creating

25
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,849
these two amazing features, the Story Builder and the Discovery Tour. Thank you again,

26
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:37,889
Thank you, Carrie. Also, if you're curious about the Discovery Tour, please ask your

27
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,210
questions on the Assassin's Creed subreddit and we'll answer as many as we can.

28
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,889
I got a piece kind of just migrating over this way.

29
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,050
Along with the Story Builder. It's an amazing time to jump back into the world

30
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,930
of Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Now, for those of us who are just joining this live stream,

31
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,370
the conference is going to start really soon, but before we wrap it up and jump

32
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,009
into the theater, we have one more amazing WoW Moments compilation for you.

33
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,370
Now, these are the best clips that we received from you, the community.

34
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,210
So hold on to your beards, mudflaps, butts, whatever you got.

35
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,780
You're just assuming that I have like a big gamer beard?

36
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:28,540
All right. That was hacking. That guy hacked. That's hacking. That person was hacking.

37
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:41,259
Oh, no, no. These are like streamers. Oh, never mind. I thought it was an Ubisoft

38
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:51,250
official thing. Did I do purple for Twitch? Does that just make me look like a fucking dickhead?

39
00:04:51,889 --> 00:05:00,910
Am I going to be the streamer voice? All right. For a second I thought my webcam was fucked up.

40
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,829
No, that's somebody else's webcam. This is my don't use webcam. I hate webcam.

41
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:15,009
This is next level reaction. Overreaction in E3. Not only am I reacting to your stream,

42
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:18,050
but I'm putting my webcam on top of your webcam.

43
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:38,720
Oh, I'm just going to spill my coffee. I'm not going to fix it. I'm going to leave it like that.

44
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,639
Over the next two or three hours, watch what happens to my hair. You are going to see

45
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,639
this piece of hair is going to fluff up. It's like a chia pet. It's going to go up

46
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:58,500
and it's going to pop. Okay. I thought it was like the little kid playing. I was like, what?

47
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,860
Dude, he started swinging while the thing was getting me up so he knew I was going to get up.

48
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,540
What if one of my clips are in here? I hope one of my clips is in here.

49
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:19,870
That would be perfect. That means I have to play an Ubisoft game, which I haven't done in

50
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:29,439
fucking three years. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. I think they had to

51
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,240
invent an ESRB rating descriptor for chicken-related acts for that asshole.

52
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,439
That was mean. I felt so bad for the chicken. I just thought it was funny. I don't know.

53
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,639
Poor chicken though. This has been such a great show. From the wow moments to all the

54
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,839
creators around here. I mean, it's just been a blast. Absolutely. Game sound's really cool.

55
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,079
That was like a super ultra broom. That was like a street sweeper broom. What the hell was

56
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,680
that? Just the energy that's been here today. I want to thank everybody who's been here on

57
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,720
site, who's watching on the street. I want one of those shirts. The star players that are

58
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,920
hanging around. It's just been an amazing day. And of course, we've got a lot more to come

59
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,480
after the conference starting at about 2 p.m. We're going to have a celebrity showdown.

60
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,000
Team T-Pain. Team Lil Yachty in Rainbow Six Siege facing off. Why did he do that?

61
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,399
Wait, what? He just hurt himself. It's going to be a good match.

62
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,600
You know, I really can't choose who I want to win. What the fuck?

63
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:31,199
I'm not in this. I'm not answering. I'm staying away. Team Neutral. He hit his mouth on that

64
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,560
coffee table. That guy's not even part of this. He's not here anymore. The show starts in 34

65
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:47,439
seconds. Back to Far Cry. Then over to Assassin's Creed again. Back around to Far

66
00:07:47,439 --> 00:08:01,360
Cry. Second time, third time. So many good options. So many good options.

67
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,160
On behalf of all of us at the pre-show, thank you so much for joining us. We're going to head

68
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,480
into the Orpheum Theater. And for everyone at Ubisoft, we hope you enjoy. Ubisoft.

69
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:21,860
Uh, rated RP to M. Uh, content may not be appropriate for anybody. Here comes an orchestra.

70
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:30,699
The Stone Cold Glass Breaks. And they do like the Stone Cold Steve Austin theme song.

71
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,820
But this is the Assassin's Creed Symphony.

72
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:45,539
Do we go now or when do we go? Do we? It's dead. I'm so pissed off right now. I can

73
00:09:45,539 --> 00:10:12,820
imagine if I got to play along. How am I gonna? I need a screwdriver to fix this thing.

74
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,500
And batteries. I don't have any batteries. Just listen to the song. It's beautiful.

75
00:10:20,029 --> 00:11:29,580
Captain Jack Sparrow. And his whimsical group of pirates. Take him on a new adventure.

76
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:47,090
This time in Assassin's Creed 8. Green flag. Instead of black flag. Orange flag. Coming next

77
00:11:47,090 --> 00:12:22,909
month. Wait, those people just were on stage just to go, uh, for like five seconds.

78
00:12:24,909 --> 00:13:05,009
I want somebody just to start leaving in the mic going. Yeah, I'll take the salmon. Uh,

79
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:09,330
can I get that with crispy skin? And instead of a risotto, can I get some, uh, spinach

80
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:24,529
waste? Oh, I would do that. I would do that. These big menus. I don't, I never get that. I

81
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:58,220
don't get it. I mean, it's beautiful. But why do they need the, kind of just, you know the

82
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:04,529
song. The song along with the beautiful music. It sounds like they start spacing their hands.

83
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:10,720
I'm not talking about the intro. I'm just talking about why you, when you're up on stage

84
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:26,480
playing with the folk though. You already love the song. Worldwide tour? What you just saw was

85
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,399
only a glimpse of the Assassin's Creed Symphony Tour starting on June 29th. Imagine an 80-piece

86
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,519
live orchestra and choir playing the iconic themes from Assassin's Creed while you relive

87
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,840
some of the most memorable moments from over a decade of Assassin's Creed in an immersive

88
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:49,120
experience. Check out acsymphony.com to learn more. I mean, excellent music, great performances,

89
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,360
goosebumps. If you like those things, I think those shows are going to be for you. But

90
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,960
of course there's one show that we all came here to see. The Ubisoft E3 conference. And

91
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,159
it's just about to start here from the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles. Now the house is packed

92
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,600
and to give you folks at home an idea what that feels like. Can I please hear the

93
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,200
show the line outside? Look at these losers. Look at them. They're still waiting to get in.

94
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:22,639
If you, if you please, if you please, I'd like to do the same for the people sitting on the

95
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:34,179
ground floor. And all the billions of people watching. Well, the excitement is here,

96
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:38,500
folks. We hope you're feeling the same way there from everyone at Ubisoft all around

97
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:45,100
the world. Please enjoy the show. That was, that was like a, I can't do that. That was

98
00:15:45,100 --> 00:16:11,600
like a bang, wink. I can't do that. World premiere. That was a countdown. Okay, yeah.

99
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:28,350
Greatest city in the world. Well, used to be. Now it's a right mess.

100
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:36,269
Government's fucked off. Extremists are grabbing power. Organized crimes slicing up the

101
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:44,029
boroughs. The war dogs are out. And freedom's a bloody joke. But this ain't there, London.

102
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:50,590
This is our London. And there's a new power growing. It's all of us together.

103
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:59,250
We're building a resistance. One recruit at a time. What's my favorite operative up to

104
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,130
this evening? And no, I never say that to the others. Scouting talent, Bagley. So gob

105
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,930
shut. Eyes peeled yet? I have no eyes. And if I did, I wouldn't peel them.

106
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,579
Fuck you, dinglebot. Where the fuck we go?

107
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:29,069
Bloody drones are everywhere. Kicking our fucking teeth in lately.

108
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,710
Then I recommend you recruit someone who can deal with drones. Brilliant. Never would

109
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:44,579
have thought of that. You're clear. They always do this long walking behind me segment.

110
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:50,180
Just punch somebody. You know what I mean? Sure, but we need a drone expert, Raj. Not a

111
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,539
shit kicker. File that one away for later. It always starts with like, well, let's slowly

112
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:04,910
walk down the same street. That's not what a gamer does. Gamer does like the fucking

113
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,750
full sprint. Like sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint. They just take the first

114
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,190
card they see. Nobody even plays Hitman like this. And that's how you're supposed

115
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,269
to play that game. Jimmy Shaw, no formal engineering training, but he has several

116
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:23,789
mischief charges for hijacking Albion drones. Hold still. Fuck you, man. You've got no

117
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:31,089
right. Fuck you, hell. We find our drone expert and he's about to get himself nicked.

118
00:18:31,089 --> 00:19:56,859
Wait, die in the game? You die in real life in the game? Well, actually, that's kind

119
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:58,460
of cool. If you die in the game, you die in real life in the game.

120
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,059
This is pretty great, actually.

121
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:51,059
I hope it's the same animations for every character. That means Grandma can like

122
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,259
fucking rip people, punch people, kick them in like the face and shit like that.

123
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,619
You know they're going to use the same animations.

124
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:22,259
This is fucking amazing. This is the greatest thing ever.

125
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,180
Can I just play as Grandma the whole game?

126
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,140
It's going to suck when you pick a character and get instantly sniped.

127
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,500
It's going to cost like fucking credits and stuff like that.

128
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,980
It's an open world. You can fall off the edges. You can get hit by cars and stuff.

129
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:09,859
So many of my characters are going to die in this game. I'll be in that menu screen.

130
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:11,859
30% of the whole game.

131
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,490
That means every time you fail a mission, you have to use a new character

132
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,650
or surrender. I'm never going to be able to relate to anybody in this game.

133
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:13,869
They always make it look so easy, but that shit don't work like that.

134
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,289
You don't like do the Heimlich maneuver one time to somebody and you kill them.

135
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:42,819
You ever choke somebody up? You ever get choked out before? It takes like fucking five minutes.

136
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:45,059
You ever choke somebody?

137
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:53,180
No, no, listen. You ever been like fucking choked out before in like wrestling or like MMA?

138
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,660
It's like a struggle and it takes like fucking a full minute.

139
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:23,339
It takes like three minutes. Like remember when Ted DiBiase did that for his special move?

140
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,819
Hulk Hogan would be in that move for like five straight minutes. It doesn't take like five

141
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:28,460
seconds.

142
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:21,170
I would have gotten hit by that car. The person's all right.

143
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:50,029
That's how they'll take us one at a time. It doesn't have to be that way. Together,

144
00:25:50,029 --> 00:26:01,700
we can change things. Wait, what happened to that bloke who helped me? He didn't make it.

145
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:26,430
Fuck it. Welcome to DedSec, James. Yeah, okay. So where do I go to meet the rest of the crew?

146
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:32,029
You don't need to go anywhere. Look around you. Everyone has a reason to fight and DedSec

147
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:42,980
is open to anyone. Welcome to the resistance. So any NPC can be a playable character if you

148
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:56,420
like convince them. NPCs are the new press F to get in the car. Ubisoft has just changed

149
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:06,539
the game here. But steal car in GTA without steal person. Like be a person. That's kind

150
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:20,690
of cool. I want more info on the fucking people's like body. It's not like stealing.

151
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:25,809
What am I doing? It's like they become an operative. I'm Clint Hawking. I'm the creative

152
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:31,329
director of Watch Dogs Legion. And for the past few years, the team and I have had the

153
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:37,329
privilege to work on a game and an innovation that we are very proud of.

154
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:43,730
Watch Dogs Legion is set in London, one of the greatest cities in the world, and it's

155
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:52,130
had a massive influence on all of our culture for centuries. Today, with Brexit, London's

156
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,089
at a turning point. It's hard to predict what the future holds for London, for

157
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:02,690
the UK, or for the world. So go recruit some old ladies and fucking drive around

158
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,930
and crash your cars.

159
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:40,829
To us all. And they are the heroes of our game. All of them. In Watch Dogs Legion,

160
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:45,069
your mission is to build a popular resistance to fight back against the emergence of an

161
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:50,269
authoritarian regime. This means you don't just play as one hero, but many. And in

162
00:28:50,269 --> 00:29:00,930
Watch Dogs Legion, you can recruit and play as anyone. Oh, my God. That took

163
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:07,259
like a monocle off. Oh, my God. This is unbelievable. Never before have I seen

164
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,220
something like this. In our game, every Londoner is fully simulated with a

165
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,940
persistent life and relationships, and anyone from the entire population can be

166
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,299
recruited into your team. Find them, profile them, hack into their lives, play

167
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:25,900
their origin mission, and win them over to your cause. The heroes you

168
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,579
recruit are all unique characters with different backstories and

169
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:34,460
personalities, fully voiced and animated, and they are the stars of your

170
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,180
story. Every cinematic in the game will change, depending on whether you're

171
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,980
playing a former MI5 action hero, a 70-year-old grandiose off-feeding pigeons

172
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,500
in the park, or anyone in between. However you want to play,

173
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:53,500
whoever you want to be, Watch Dogs Legion lets you be that. Fighting

174
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,740
against an authoritarian regime. They're taking us over. They're trying

175
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:04,700
to get rid of us. They're killing us. Hack into the people's lives and break

176
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:12,859
their privacy and then force them to be part of your system. Hack into their lives

177
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:20,559
and take them over. Play as anyone is the innovation that transforms a story

178
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,359
about freeing London and the world from the grip of tyranny into a game

179
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,319
about the heroes that live in each of us. Because being a hero isn't just a job

180
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,200
for someone else anymore. It's a job for everyone. So on behalf of the

181
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,039
Watch Dogs Legion's team here and around the world, I hope to see you on

182
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,319
the booth. Thank you for your time and welcome to the Resistance.

183
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,799
That'll be fun. We will.

184
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:56,720
Had a good run there for a while. Now it's all riots,

185
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:08,140
riots, bombings, people thrown in cages like animals. Oh, I know you can forget

186
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:16,180
the killer robots everywhere. So yeah, that's all gonna be shit.

187
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:25,170
It's up to us to take our city back. The thing is, we can't do it alone.

188
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:30,609
We need to recruit a Resistance. I know what you're thinking. Where do we start?

189
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:39,099
Open your eyes and take a look around. Look here. Look at him. No, not him.

190
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:50,430
Him. Former MI5. Duty never ends. He can get anywhere and erase anyone.

191
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,839
Let's kick those bastards out of London.

192
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,880
She got kicked out of Oxbridge Robotics School for teaching him to reproduce.

193
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:13,680
Oh, come on. Come at me. He'll crack your skull. Just there's like there's a handful

194
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,359
of different classes. I think that granny was a robot expert.

195
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:30,400
This had better be fucking good to introduce you to the deadliest of the law.

196
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,519
She's not old. She's experienced.

197
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,299
Like I said, you can recruit anyone. And I'll mean bloody anyone.

198
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:54,529
Him. Her. Everyone is a secret weapon. Find them. Build the Resistance.

199
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,259
Let's unfuck this world.

200
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:31,309
Anyone. Yeah. Even me? Even animals. Grandma makes that. I mean, I know I'm like,

201
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:42,990
biased, but. Microwave? It's always sunny in Philadelphia.

202
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:56,460
Hello. My name is Rob McElhenney and for the past 14 years I have been making a television

203
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,380
show called It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Are you fucking serious?

204
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,239
Thank you. But I am here today because I love games. And I wanted to express that

205
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,199
love in the only way that I know how save for playing them. And that is to make a TV show

206
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,880
about them. More importantly, the people who create those games and the people who

207
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,000
play them. So last year I called the funniest people that I knew. Charlie Day,

208
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,199
Megan Ganz and David Hornsby. All executive producers on Sunny.

209
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,320
And we started talking. We realized very early on that if we were going to do this,

210
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,360
we wanted to do it right and to be as authentic as possible because as you all know,

211
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,699
nobody smells bullshit like this particular community. So we did the right thing.

212
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,300
We partnered with Ubisoft and away we went. It has been an incredible experience working

213
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,739
with one of the biggest and best game developers in the world to inspire us

214
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,780
because our show takes place in the fictional studio that created the biggest

215
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:03,059
MMORPG in the world, Mythic Quest. And we meet them on the cusp of releasing

216
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:08,579
their biggest expansion yet, Mythic Quest Raven's Banquet. The show follows the team

217
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:12,420
of devs as they navigate the challenges of running their game while dealing with the

218
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,900
difficulties of modern office life. These cut back to back stage like Frank's back there.

219
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,139
This scheme is going to work. Dennis, shut up. The head of the team is my character,

220
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:32,539
creative director, Ian Grim. Why are you covered in oil? I don't understand what that's

221
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:34,539
for. This part of scheme.

222
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,579
Short of the best that they can make because that is what the community you deserve.

223
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,340
I promise you that in making this show, we took the same approach.

224
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,300
So without further ado, here's a brief look into our upcoming TV series for Apple TV plus

225
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,900
Mythic Quest Raven's Banquet. Apple TV plus. What is Apple TV plus?

226
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,699
What is Mythic Quest? Some may say it's just a video game.

227
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:45,199
When it first debuted, MQ was hailed as a masterpiece. Now played in 20 different countries

228
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:51,840
on six continents, it's the biggest massive multiplayer role playing game of all time.

229
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,760
And today, they find themselves on the precipice of their first major expansion,

230
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:08,320
Mythic Quest Raven's Banquet. And it all falls on the shoulders of one man,

231
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,679
creative director, Ian Grim. When we think about cultural touchstones,

232
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:21,840
we think ET, Star Wars, Avatar, and yet our industry dwarfs the traditional entertainment

233
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:28,719
business. So when we think about legends, why not think Mythic Quest?

234
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:35,440
True indeed. And when we think of visionary world building artists, instead of just Spielberg,

235
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:48,130
Lucas and Cameron, why not think Grim? I'm sorry, I gotta stop. What is this?

236
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,690
It's a commercial for the game. It's a commercial for you. It's still going.

237
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:03,869
This is insane. I think it's brilliant.

238
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:28,190
This is a TV show. This is not a game. This is a game. I know this song. You gotta play the best

239
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:36,130
part when they scream where they're from. Hey there, my name is Parker and Taro Makai,

240
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,769
esports caster for Rainbow Six Siege. Celebrity showdown.

241
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:44,130
There are so many exciting things to come in year four. In-game events, map reworks,

242
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,849
playlist updates, a roster of 52 unique operators, and of course, a thriving

243
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:55,409
esports scene. Starting tomorrow, you'll be able to enjoy our 13th season, Operation Phantom

244
00:38:55,409 --> 00:39:01,570
Sight. This major content update brings two new operators to T-Rainbow, Nook and Warden.

245
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:06,849
After this show, be sure to stick around for an intense celebrity match starring T-Pain,

246
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:10,530
Little Yachty, and some of your favorite Twitch streamers for the Twitch Rivals

247
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:15,329
celebrity show match. But right now, here's a glimpse of the new season in action.

248
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,329
Thank you, everyone, and have a great E3.

249
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,360
Brawlhalla master. These things are whack. One v one me, bro. For real. Uh, yeah. I'll

250
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,639
toast your buns again. Sure. Want to choose a different character? Yeah, I choose me.

251
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:42,980
Yeah. They inked it. Adventure time deal here. Whoa, it's those guys from the game.

252
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:12,449
Oh, are they just going to take over the game? They start introducing way more adventure

253
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:51,409
time characters. They're just skins. Oh, okay. Are they? Dude, I'm not fucking around here.

254
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:55,730
Wouldn't you love like a Smash Brothers cartoon fucking roster game?

255
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:01,489
Wren, Stimpy, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Ed, Edd, and Eddie. I have like 400 characters in

256
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:04,769
the game. I don't care. Oh, actually, that already exists. It's called, it's called Mewman.

257
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:14,340
That already, that's already a thing. Let's just play that. The only test of a man's worth

258
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:22,000
is battle. When those rounds come screaming past your head, you're gonna learn if you

259
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:32,590
are hungry enough, hungry enough to take that victory. We're going to battle with

260
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:40,619
the soldiers that we used to be. Ghosts. And you better believe that they are hungry too.

261
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,679
Once upon a time, some of these ghosts, they may have been your friends.

262
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:54,059
And there is brotherhood. But then there is what the world needs. These ghosts,

263
00:43:54,059 --> 00:44:01,329
they are the past. They still serve the machine that we left behind. And right now,

264
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:12,989
for the future, the world needs us. I'm honored. I want somebody to make a game where you play.

265
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:16,510
I'm honored to be here with you tonight. And everybody's getting sick of like these,

266
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:21,630
as you head into battle, we need to fight now. Look in your eye, those bad intentions

267
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:30,610
in your mind. Remember this. You are the few with the courage to make history.

268
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,590
You had the desire to take victory.

269
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:48,300
You will be on a battlefield full of ghosts, but only you have that hunger that makes you wolves.

270
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,719
Ghost Recon Breakpoint. Ghost Recon Wildlands. Ghost Recon

271
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:11,389
Constant Conflict. That's what they should just name it. Ghost Recon Constant Conflict 3.

272
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:17,869
Good to be here. This is the dog on screen. Click dog. Click dog on screen. It's a dog.

273
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:23,219
It's a real honor to be here with you guys today. Thank you. I love you too.

274
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,179
This is awesome. This has been really great and exciting. And I'm really,

275
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:34,340
I'm really honored. Dog on screen. I'm enormously proud to be part of the development

276
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:39,699
of this game. It was a pleasure to work with the Ubisoft team. You know, I've had

277
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:44,820
the chance to play some pretty strong, tough men over the years. I've played a deputy fighting

278
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:55,699
zombies, special forces soldier who lost everything. And now I get to play Cole D. Walker. He's a

279
00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:00,500
skilled former special operations soldier with his own sense of responsibility and his own

280
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,659
moral code. He knows how things should be run. He loves his brothers, his fellow soldiers,

281
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:12,099
but he is willing to do whatever it takes to complete his mission and take control of Aroha.

282
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,019
There is no briefing. There's no backup. You will not face a group of bad guys or

283
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:24,019
a criminal organization. You will face an entire army. My army. Good boy. The wolves.

284
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,780
We've got the numbers. We've got the organization. And remember, we trained alongside

285
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:43,340
you the weaponry of a fully operational special ops detachment. Trust me. There's

286
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:49,420
an unparalleled arsenal of high tech weapons in Aroha. So if you think you have what it takes,

287
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:55,900
strap on your boots and you get ready to take on the wolves. I wasn't paying them. Take on

288
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:09,099
me. See you in a row. We'll be waiting. Perfect predators. I was sorry, there's a dog on the

289
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:23,309
screen. I literally nothing else matters. Have the element of surprise. They have the technology,

290
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:53,039
but we have the skills to even the odds. They have an army who we fight with our

291
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:55,039
brothers and sisters.

292
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:15,019
Fight. They are hungry. Take up arms. We are enraged. Fight. Fight. All we do is fight.

293
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:23,809
You're ghosts and ghosts. And they always do that like fucking rip the head tape down and

294
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:28,130
that fucking head hits the ground. You know, conflict. Ghost recon. Constant conflict. Full.

295
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:43,679
Rip his fucking head to the ground. I'm not insane. That was, I was talking about a video

296
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:52,610
game. That was a video game. We're talking about video games. Being a community developer

297
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:57,889
on Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint has been an incredible journey for me so far.

298
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:05,309
When we first announced the game, you were very excited. And after discussions of members

299
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:12,429
of our community, I today announce that with our post launch plan, we will be bringing back our

300
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:25,460
AI teammates for our solo players. Wait, what does this mean? Ghost Recon Breakpoint.

301
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:32,559
We want to go the extra mile with how we engage with you. So I'm pleased to announce

302
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:41,039
a brand new community program that will allow you to express and share your passion.

303
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:57,889
Welcome to Ghost Recon Delta Company. From cosplay to streaming, fan art to forum

304
00:49:57,889 --> 00:50:04,050
discussions. However, you show your love for Ghost Recon, there is something for you in our

305
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:11,250
five different detachments. You like crushing heads against walls and smashing direct discussions

306
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:17,010
with our studio. So head over to our Ghost Recon Breakpoint website to find out more

307
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:21,889
and hear from you soon, Delta Ghosts. Thank you very much, everyone.

308
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:50,800
Thank you, Laura. Hello, everyone. The Ghost Recon team has always taken great pride

309
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:57,280
from your passion for our games. And that passion is what pushes us to deliver

310
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:04,940
the best pickups experience out there. Behind enemy lines, you will be fighting the most

311
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:10,380
dangerous enemies the Ghosts have ever faced. Conflict. Constantly testing your survival skills.

312
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:18,880
Yes, we can't wait to welcome you in Ghost Recon Breakpoint on October 4th.

313
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:26,769
And one month before that, our beta will be live on September 5th.

314
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,039
You can register on our website right now for a chance to participate.

315
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,059
Ghost Recon Breakpoint will be live for years to come.

316
00:51:47,969 --> 00:52:04,880
We've got your back. New content, free updates, and many surprises inspired by our community.

317
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:17,340
Yes, yes. Like this one. I haven't said anything. I've got, I don't really have,

318
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:21,019
I don't know anything about this. All I know is it's just conflict. That's all I know.

319
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:29,099
It's the Terminator. The Terminator. No, why does everybody have to have the Terminator

320
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:42,340
in a game? Did they ink the deal at the same time? Another Terminator. Will you survive

321
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:48,579
your break point? That looked a lot better in the mirror. All right. I'll tell you.

322
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,659
I mean, I've done that before. I know what it's like. I've done that before.

323
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:12,639
Why the Terminator? There has to be some weird reason why this fucking two Terminator instances

324
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:29,900
here. Conflict. She's all in. She's ready to shoot and punch, crush her head. She's got her

325
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:39,119
Terminator ready to crush heads. Her best defense is this crush head.

326
00:53:56,289 --> 00:53:59,170
Squishing heads like Goro between her hands.

327
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:24,610
Lead the elite squad. They're all elite squads in every game. Every single one of them.

328
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:29,090
I want a group of people that have no fucking idea what they're doing.

329
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:33,650
Pre-register now. Why do we, I don't want this anymore. I want to be like a moron

330
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,570
that doesn't have any training, that doesn't know how to do anything.

331
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:40,539
It's the most elite specialists. No, I want to be a guy, I want to be like a fucking

332
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:44,059
sewing master. I don't, I don't want to be like a fucking specialist anymore.

333
00:54:45,019 --> 00:55:00,289
10 years. 10 years. That's a lot of dancing. We're exhausted. I know. But think of everything

334
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:08,670
we've done. It's not for us, or for you, or you. It's for them, the press.

335
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:16,739
We danced and Sivio and his girlfriend got married. We danced and our friend

336
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:24,980
Jaden Rodriguez danced for millions, bringing together generations. We danced and they set

337
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:31,300
world records. Do you remember Carrie? Of course we do because we were with her.

338
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,860
Dance is why we exist. And I know we're going to have much more of these moments

339
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,139
because dance is a force. I was about to be in a magician game, but

340
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:45,139
700 million people use this as a workout routine.

341
00:55:48,099 --> 00:56:13,469
Could have got the magician game. There's so many prime examples on the stage right now.

342
00:56:13,469 --> 00:57:04,480
The magician game. 10 years. We got like 10 more years before the S&P is going to crash.

343
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,420
I feel like it's weirder for me to be watching this.

344
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:41,059
Then it is. I feel like I need to be there. I'm like embarrassed to be here.

345
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:46,900
No, because this is like great dancing. It is. This is like fantastic display of talented people.

346
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:54,860
But like I'm just kind of like, I feel like maybe if I was there,

347
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:09,389
get up and dance. Nobody else is doing that. I'm just kind of like, I guess I'm here still.

348
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,119
Those people are so much more talented than me.

349
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:38,579
We got some hype in the chat, please. There's an old tale about this village.

350
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:43,699
This is still going on. A samurai came to deliver justice.

351
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:53,059
Nest clouded her mind. She slaughtered every living soul.

352
00:58:57,489 --> 00:59:05,300
Became the spirit of death. Comes the Terminator.

353
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,260
Years later, we hunted the samurai in the village.

354
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:17,699
We didn't believe the old tale. Not until a horror came.

355
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,210
Spirits hungered for our souls.

356
00:59:29,010 --> 01:00:02,130
Sakura is the spirit of death.

357
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:08,929
She's brought a curse that will doom us all.

358
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:24,420
We got another one. They lined it up tonight.

359
01:00:28,989 --> 01:00:55,059
We got a flatliner raid coming in.

360
01:00:55,539 --> 01:01:43,980
Rainbow Six quarantine. Free player.

361
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:55,789
Hi, I'm Biojad, and I'm the lead game designer on the next Rainbow Six game.

362
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:01,230
They're really, really, let's say something about like 2019.

363
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,710
It's called Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.

364
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,230
They don't want to call a game anything else.

365
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:10,670
I'm part of a new team in Ubisoft Montreal that set out on an exciting

366
01:02:10,989 --> 01:02:17,469
mission. Create a radically redesigned co-op experience built on the

367
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:21,949
foundations of one of the best shooters of this generation.

368
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:25,949
What siege is to the PvP shooter genre?

369
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,949
We will be to PvE co-op.

370
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:37,820
All right, that's, this is interesting. This is pretty interesting.

371
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,940
Quarantine will test your tactical skills and survive.

372
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:41,900
Three player co-op.

373
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,539
Holding you and your operators on the razors edge.

374
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:54,619
It pulls you together as a squad facing off against an unknown and

375
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:55,980
devastating parasite.

376
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:03,659
You will risk everything every time you step into quarantine.

377
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:09,260
Stay tuned and start prepping for your next deployment.

378
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:12,699
I can't wait to show you more and have a great E3.

379
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:15,980
No, that was like the coolest thing possibly here today.

380
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,619
A three player co-op game.

381
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:21,789
We'll just get to see the trailer.

382
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,150
See you in like two years when that's ready to play.

383
01:03:42,179 --> 01:03:42,980
Give me a clip of me.

384
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:44,980
Give me a clip of me.

385
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:46,989
There has to be one.

386
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,989
What did I play? I played like Far Cry 5.

387
01:03:49,949 --> 01:03:57,179
There's not a clip of me going like, what the heck?

388
01:03:57,179 --> 01:03:58,059
Like there has to be.

389
01:03:58,059 --> 01:03:59,579
There's at least 10,000 of those.

390
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,639
Fucking epic.

391
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:06,960
All right, there's got to be like at least a dozen of them.

392
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,679
I've done it before.

393
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,900
No, don't clip that one.

394
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,980
As creative director at Red Storm Entertainment.

395
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,980
I'm not, I'm irrelevant.

396
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:25,900
There's no greater reward for me or the team than to see our game come to life

397
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:30,059
and to see our players, our star players,

398
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:35,019
taking tremendous pride in being a part of the division.

399
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:43,980
Now, if you haven't had the opportunity to play The Division 2 yet,

400
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:49,579
we would be thrilled to have you join our very passionate community

401
01:04:49,579 --> 01:04:52,940
because I'm happy to announce that this week only,

402
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,860
between June 13th and June 16th,

403
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:02,860
The Division 2 will be absolutely 100% free for everyone to play.

404
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:12,559
And there's no better time to join us as we're about to release

405
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,079
the first of our major content updates for our year one journey.

406
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,599
Play free for three days.

407
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:18,880
A journey beyond Washington DC.

408
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,559
That shit's not even long enough to go through the tutorial.

409
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,559
To save not just a city, but an entire nation.

410
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:51,659
Conflict.

411
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:57,179
All right.

412
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:58,420
All right.

413
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,219
Different kinds of conflict.

414
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:00,739
I want animal conflict.

415
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:01,139
Thank you.

416
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:02,659
Episode one.

417
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:04,179
Like a jungle game.

418
01:06:04,179 --> 01:06:04,820
Right around the corner.

419
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:05,860
You call it a line.

420
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:10,900
We deliver to you new main missions and a brand new game experience.

421
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:15,460
For the first time, we're taking the fight outside the city

422
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:20,340
and you'll venture deep into the woodlands to spearhead an attack

423
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:24,739
on a presidential compound as you seek to bring a traitor to justice.

424
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,739
The National Zoo is the setting of our next mission.

425
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:29,059
Zoo.

426
01:06:29,059 --> 01:06:33,059
Where you and your team will hunt down the surviving outcast leader.

427
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:34,579
You and your team play as snakes.

428
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:37,300
This brings us to our final edition of episode one.

429
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,380
A place called Kenley College.

430
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,860
And it's home to an entirely new gameplay experience.

431
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:46,980
One that will take exploration, investigation, and logic

432
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:51,780
to uncover the fate of a military convoy gone dark.

433
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,780
I'm getting sick of like backpack sprints.

434
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,280
Episode two.

435
01:06:55,059 --> 01:06:59,619
Coming this fall, we'll bring to you the Pentagon.

436
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:09,920
Once an impenetrable fortress, it has fallen to the black tusks.

437
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,800
You got a backpack on?

438
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,880
Secrets are about to be thrown out into the open.

439
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,760
Are you running like this?

440
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:19,280
You must do everything it takes to secure what lies behind the walls of this last castle.

441
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:22,639
But this won't be the greatest danger you face in episode two.

442
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:23,679
Really fucking zoo game.

443
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:24,800
No, I know zoo.

444
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,599
There's like plenty of those.

445
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:29,039
That our second grade will be coming this fall.

446
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,039
Bringing back intense eight-player action.

447
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,800
Yeah.

448
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,449
You tackled the first raid.

449
01:07:36,449 --> 01:07:37,730
It was awesome.

450
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:40,769
And we cannot wait to see what world records you break this time around.

451
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:41,250
Caveman.

452
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,530
They already kind of did that.

453
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:45,889
This brings us to our third and final episode of year one.

454
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:53,789
What if rebirth was not about bringing the world as we know it back to life?

455
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:55,550
But the opposite.

456
01:07:57,519 --> 01:07:59,360
One man holds that power.

457
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,719
And humanity itself is at stake.

458
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,559
Can you guys guess if he's a special operative?

459
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,960
It's time to engage in a manhunt.

460
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,599
Let's see.

461
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:16,210
Let's see how like skilled and talented and special operative this guy is.

462
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:17,729
Poor girl.

463
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:30,949
Sorry.

464
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,539
No, no, he's just got a backpack on.

465
01:08:37,539 --> 01:08:38,579
He's got a gun.

466
01:08:38,579 --> 01:08:39,220
He's trained.

467
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:42,930
We fought to protect the weak.

468
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:50,369
But training doesn't prepare you to hunt someone you used to call brother.

469
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:54,859
He has left us no other choice.

470
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,199
If we don't stop him, there will be nothing left to save.

471
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,329
Holy shit, what about that?

472
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,760
I can't wait for that.

473
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:14,720
Okay, one last thing.

474
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,119
As you might know, we have been working on a movie.

475
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:26,479
It will be directed by David Leitch, starring Jessica Chastain and Jake Gyllenhaal.

476
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:34,479
Well, today, I'm proud to announce that we will be making the Division movie with Netflix.

477
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:37,199
More to come on that in the future.

478
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:38,560
Thank you very much.

479
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:38,960
Thank you.

480
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,000
Okay, that just has like a bag of rice.

481
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,640
That just has like now South Park already made this joke.

482
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,640
It was a good joke.

483
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,279
That's a pretty good South Park joke that I was about to make.

484
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:04,340
Hello, I'm Brenda Panagrossi.

485
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:07,539
I'm vice president of platform and product management.

486
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,539
Ubisoft has been creating worlds for over 30 years.

487
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:12,260
Uno.

488
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,979
We have the most diverse library of games,

489
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:18,020
and we're about to make it even easier for you to play them.

490
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:22,500
Uno, except the cards all have backpacks on and guns.

491
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,180
It's perfect.

492
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:26,180
Called Uplay Plus.

493
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,380
And they shoot at each other.

494
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:37,710
You'll get earliest available access to new games,

495
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:41,949
including the premium editions with all their additional content.

496
01:10:41,949 --> 01:10:47,310
And you can enjoy the depth of our PC catalog that includes over 100 games and growing.

497
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,350
We talked about this yesterday.

498
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:58,609
It's like Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV Plus, HBO Now, it's going to be Ubisoft Now,

499
01:10:58,609 --> 01:11:03,170
Microsoft Go, Square Enix, yay.

500
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:08,050
We'll enable free access in September at launch.

501
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,180
But here's the thing.

502
01:11:25,819 --> 01:11:29,420
If you buy one game a month, this is where the notification comes from.

503
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:35,500
If you buy like one or two games a month, it's $60 to $120 a month, right?

504
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:43,260
Well, I mean, then why don't you just pay $88 a month every month

505
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,539
and get access to everything?

506
01:11:45,579 --> 01:11:48,300
You know, it's like, ah, it's going to happen.

507
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,560
Speak up.

508
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,439
Did you not hear my point?

509
01:11:53,439 --> 01:12:00,189
I just made a pretty good point that you just don't know the games.

510
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:02,350
Yeah, you will not own those games.

511
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,670
But there's going to be the next five years.

512
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,390
So you're going to see like the $15 from Microsoft a month,

513
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:11,630
$15 from Ubisoft, $20 from Square Enix.

514
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:12,989
I keep making these companies up.

515
01:12:12,989 --> 01:12:14,189
Maybe even like companies like Nintendo.

516
01:12:14,189 --> 01:12:15,069
It doesn't matter.

517
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:18,510
Sony like $18.99 for the PS Plus Power Pass.

518
01:12:19,229 --> 01:12:21,390
It's going to be like $120 a month if you get them all.

519
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:23,390
Or you just buy the games.

520
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,069
They're going to slowly going to make it a reality.

521
01:12:31,899 --> 01:12:36,939
Players are we want to provide access to our games and services.

522
01:12:36,939 --> 01:12:40,060
I'm pleased to announce that in 2020,

523
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:43,180
Uplay Plus will be available on Stadia.

524
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:51,039
Cue the appropriate enthusiasm music.

525
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:53,600
Stadia is the new generation gaming platform

526
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,479
where you could play our Stadia games from any device.

527
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,159
A special thank you to Phil Harrison and his team.

528
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:02,880
This is the beginning of our partnership.

529
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,659
I'm not muted.

530
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:13,819
I can see I'm looking right now at my audio device.

531
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:14,539
Thank you so much.

532
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:15,420
Have fun playing.

533
01:13:19,789 --> 01:13:22,350
And it's not it's just the explore.

534
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:23,550
It's where we're going in the future.

535
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:24,829
Subscription based models.

536
01:13:24,829 --> 01:13:25,949
Everybody wants to have one.

537
01:13:26,909 --> 01:14:07,220
Skateboard.

538
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,399
I have no idea what's going on.

539
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,199
Basketball, future champions, football.

540
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:44,079
My name is Stefan and I'm a proud member of the roller champions team.

541
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,520
All right, come on, bring it up.

542
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:51,810
From the get-go.

543
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:52,609
Everyone starts getting up.

544
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:53,649
Let's get on stage.

545
01:14:53,729 --> 01:14:54,770
We're very clear.

546
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:55,729
I'm going to sit down, sit down.

547
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:57,090
We wanted to create something new.

548
01:14:57,649 --> 01:15:00,930
We wanted to capture the intangible excitement

549
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,649
of players preparing for the big game.

550
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:06,770
The hype of team play and competition

551
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:09,649
along with the craziness of high speed racing.

552
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,689
So we started working on roller champions.

553
01:15:12,689 --> 01:15:16,689
A skill based team PVP sports game

554
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:20,050
that is as fun to watch as it is to play.

555
01:15:20,689 --> 01:15:24,689
A game in which you, the player, can create your own story

556
01:15:24,689 --> 01:15:26,130
as you roll up to glory.

557
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:29,090
But right now I know how it looks.

558
01:15:29,729 --> 01:15:32,609
We showed you a trailer and I got on stage

559
01:15:32,609 --> 01:15:33,810
starting my little speech.

560
01:15:34,369 --> 01:15:35,649
That's all well and good.

561
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,529
But when will you ever get to play this?

562
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:40,930
How about today?

563
01:15:42,449 --> 01:15:47,500
He said today.

564
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,220
All right, that was actually kind of a bad idea.

565
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:54,579
When we're done here, I want you to head over to play

566
01:15:54,579 --> 01:15:58,899
on your PC to download a pre-alpha E3 demo

567
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:00,659
of roller champions.

568
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:03,779
Play the heck out of it for the next few days.

569
01:16:03,779 --> 01:16:04,260
Play it now.

570
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,779
When you're done, head to the forums

571
01:16:05,779 --> 01:16:07,060
to tell us what you thought.

572
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:08,500
And you know what?

573
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,260
We firmly believe that you will be screaming

574
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,939
as loudly as our colleagues did

575
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:15,460
when they first got to play this.

576
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,140
I'm not going to play it right now.

577
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,939
But I can't just leave you with that.

578
01:16:20,899 --> 01:16:23,460
So here's a taste of what you should expect

579
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,380
once you click that download button.

580
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,340
I probably can't even stream it.

581
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,340
It's probably like not allowed.

582
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:44,579
People are streaming it right now.

583
01:16:44,579 --> 01:16:47,779
I don't want to go download champion ball.

584
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,729
I have to go like sign up and shit.

585
01:16:51,729 --> 01:16:53,409
I don't want to do this right now.

586
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,819
You want me to go download this game right now?

587
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:01,140
And like, why would I do this?

588
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:03,659
It's probably fun, but I don't want...

589
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:06,720
I'm not, no, I'm not doing it.

590
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,760
I saw one person sit down.

591
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,560
So I'm not doing it.

592
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,539
They're trying to tap into that rocket lead.

593
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:33,470
Kind of, it kind of is...

594
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:47,859
So first, I want to say thank you to...

595
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:49,939
All right, I wasn't paying.

596
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:51,140
I thought that was John Lithgow.

597
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,300
I really did.

598
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:55,939
I was like, John's John Lithgow.

599
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:58,100
Thank you to all the Ubisoft teams

600
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:01,060
around the world for your talent and energy.

601
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:04,180
You know, congratulations for another great show.

602
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,420
I thought everyone was like cheering

603
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,020
because like, holy shit, like John Lithgow

604
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:08,579
was like on stage.

605
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:10,100
He's probably in like one of the games or something.

606
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:16,739
I believe video games have a positive impact on...

607
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:19,220
I got out of my like area I'm allowed in.

608
01:18:19,859 --> 01:18:23,539
At Ubisoft, our intention is to create games

609
01:18:23,539 --> 01:18:27,939
that will make you stronger and happier in your life.

610
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:30,430
When you play Ubisoft games...

611
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:33,149
Get back in the Gamer Cube.

612
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:35,710
Spend quality time with family and friends...

613
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:36,590
I just need to stretch.

614
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:38,510
And meet new inspiring people.

615
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:41,470
Learn more about yourself by doing.

616
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:43,229
And gain new perspective on the world...

617
01:18:43,229 --> 01:18:44,909
I just turned off my fucking PlayStation 4.

618
01:18:44,909 --> 01:18:46,270
And help shape it.

619
01:18:47,069 --> 01:18:51,149
So to everyone who plays our games,

620
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:52,909
thank you for your love.

621
01:18:53,949 --> 01:19:00,369
Some of those games look pretty fun.

622
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:01,329
They did.

623
01:19:01,329 --> 01:19:03,649
The new Watch Dogs looks actually good.

624
01:19:03,649 --> 01:19:04,529
Looks fun to play.

625
01:19:04,529 --> 01:19:07,250
Wish us to always do better and go further.

626
01:19:08,529 --> 01:19:12,529
So now I'm very proud to announce a new project

627
01:19:12,529 --> 01:19:15,010
from an exceptional team in Quebec City.

628
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:21,569
Please give a warm upload to Marc-Alessi Coté

629
01:19:21,569 --> 01:19:24,609
who is coming to show you a sneak peek of his game.

630
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:33,020
I mean, if it's another Rayman, then that's a huge hit.

631
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:38,220
Thank you, everybody.

632
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:41,069
Over the last 10 years,

633
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:44,670
I've had the chance to be part of an incredible team

634
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:48,590
that has always pushed the limits of Assassin's Creed

635
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:51,229
and shown us different periods of our past.

636
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:56,560
But our imagination has always been bound

637
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,119
to the reality of the history books.

638
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:03,520
These past four years are minds I've lingered

639
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,319
on a different aspect of our history.

640
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,760
The mythology.

641
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,039
The stories of the ancient gods

642
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,680
and their misadventures have existed

643
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,439
through generations of storytellers and audiences

644
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:19,760
and have transformed into tales

645
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,199
that we still know and love today.

646
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,239
And now these stories have shaped our dreams,

647
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,359
inspiring us to build something new,

648
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,439
something that transcends the limits

649
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:36,079
that we have always set upon ourselves.

650
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,319
Today, I'm very proud to have the chance

651
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:43,119
to show you a glimpse, to show you a teaser

652
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:45,840
of this brand new game that we've been working on.

653
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:47,920
I hope you enjoy it.

654
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,680
Thank you and have a great E3.

655
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,079
Hello, everybody.

656
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:53,920
We didn't get that was.

657
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,079
Hello, everybody at home.

658
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,159
Thank you so much for watching.

659
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,600
I hope you had a great show, but this is just the beginning,

660
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:03,840
guys.

661
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,960
This is just the beginning.

662
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,000
Thank you.

663
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,479
Thank you.

664
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:06,960
Thank you.

665
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:09,920
This is just the beginning.

666
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,560
We are here outside of the Orpheum Theater

667
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,760
live from the pro zone where we have an incredible

668
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,560
Rainbow Six Siege show match together with.

669
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,520
That was a weird transition.

670
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,720
We have our two new best friends, T-Pain and Lil Yachty.

671
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,000
That's all right.

672
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,920
I kind of don't even know anything about

673
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,880
what they were just talking about.

674
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:29,760
They were just talking about how.

675
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,560
This is like the biggest thing we've like ever done

676
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,640
is a new project from a new studio and.

677
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,310
Okay.

678
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:37,630
Okay.

679
01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:40,189
It is like the trailer from the iPad app store.

680
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:41,630
And we're live again indeed.

681
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:44,909
So once again, a quick reminder, Operation Phantom

682
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:47,710
Sight will be available starting tomorrow.

683
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,630
Any Rainbow Six fans here?

684
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,550
We're live again.

685
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:52,909
Well, it never turned off.

686
01:22:52,909 --> 01:22:53,949
I like that.

687
01:22:53,949 --> 01:22:55,390
Now we are super proud.

688
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:57,550
Super happy to present to you the Twitch

689
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:00,270
Rivals Rainbow Six Siege Celebrity Showdown

690
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:01,149
for the first time.

691
01:23:01,149 --> 01:23:02,829
I want to see who the celebrities are.

692
01:23:02,829 --> 01:23:05,069
Many Rivals events to follow this year.

693
01:23:05,069 --> 01:23:05,550
Turn it off.

694
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:05,789
Turn.

695
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:06,750
Wait, is this not allowed?

696
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:07,550
Well, I guess.

697
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:08,430
Is this in the terms?

698
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:09,550
At home and do you guys hear?

699
01:23:11,329 --> 01:23:14,930
Also, we have, as mentioned, eight incredible

700
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:15,430
streamers.

701
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:17,890
We have eight of the best streamers from all

702
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:18,930
over the world.

703
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:19,649
No, it's not illegal.

704
01:23:19,649 --> 01:23:21,010
Probably the best in the world.

705
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:21,489
Why not?

706
01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:22,050
It's allowed.

707
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:22,449
It's allowed.

708
01:23:22,449 --> 01:23:23,890
And two amazing team captains.

709
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:26,609
And a quick thank you to our sponsors,

710
01:23:26,609 --> 01:23:27,090
to our partners.

711
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:27,810
That was all right.

712
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:29,329
For hooking us up with some of the gear

713
01:23:29,329 --> 01:23:30,130
you see out here.

714
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:30,689
Thank you guys.

715
01:23:30,689 --> 01:23:31,729
You're amazing.

716
01:23:31,729 --> 01:23:34,449
The C3 is kind of one of those lull years.

717
01:23:34,449 --> 01:23:36,529
Besides like the Microsoft console.

718
01:23:36,529 --> 01:23:37,569
Watch Dogs 3 looks fun.

719
01:23:37,569 --> 01:23:38,050
Teams.

720
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:40,210
Team number one.

721
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,090
Why am I not here?

722
01:23:41,729 --> 01:23:42,850
Why was I not invited?

723
01:23:43,489 --> 01:23:44,529
We got T-Pain.

724
01:23:45,329 --> 01:23:46,369
I don't play.

725
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:46,930
Why would I?

726
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:49,010
I don't play Rainbow Six Siege.

727
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:51,890
We got the Russian badge of what's good.

728
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:54,130
It's like, hey, dude, why were you not

729
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,810
invited to the Star Wars premiere?

730
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:55,890
I feel good.

731
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:55,970
I feel good.

732
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:57,170
I'm slightly less bloated than.

733
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,180
I'm good.

734
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,380
I brought some friends.

735
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:00,340
I did bring some friends.

736
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,699
These are all the winners over here.

737
01:24:01,699 --> 01:24:03,859
So, you know, that's just how that works.

738
01:24:03,859 --> 01:24:06,180
So, you know, we got Yachty here.

739
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,220
I heard.

740
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,039
I had heard.

741
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:10,239
What's the first thing that came to mind

742
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,199
when you heard you were going to battle?

743
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:11,520
Why?

744
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,319
What's wrong with it?

745
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:12,880
You know, it's no big deal.

746
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,760
It's just like it's an extension of E3.

747
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,800
He was like, oh, he's going to be there too.

748
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,600
That'd be cool.

749
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,880
He can watch us win, I guess.

750
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,439
Oh, shit.

751
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:18,479
So you're going to win.

752
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:20,720
Am I going to watch the Rainbow Six Siege?

753
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,840
Yeah, sure enough.

754
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,239
All right.

755
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,359
So let's call.

756
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:24,479
Turn it off.

757
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:25,760
Turn it off.

758
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,479
Whoa.

759
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:27,439
Everybody make some noise for Yachty.

760
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:28,640
No, I'm going to watch this.

761
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,520
We're watching this.

762
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,880
But, like, at least I'm just.

763
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,159
We've got little Yachty.

764
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:40,560
Bikini body.

765
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,199
Oh, my god.

766
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:42,399
Everyone's freaking out.

767
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:44,000
Y'all good?

768
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,939
Well, why is this so such a conflict?

769
01:24:48,939 --> 01:24:50,859
It's just not enough with the conflict.

770
01:24:51,739 --> 01:24:53,420
Enough with the conflict.

771
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:53,979
You guys.

772
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,260
It's starting to get to you.

773
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:58,140
I heard that if NA win, it'd be the first thing they ever won.

774
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:58,939
So.

775
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:00,060
Oh, shit.

776
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,069
Any response to that?

777
01:25:03,069 --> 01:25:04,430
You know, winning once is always great.

778
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,069
Don't big deal.

779
01:25:05,069 --> 01:25:07,470
This is probably my first time winning anything at all ever.

780
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,350
So, you know.

781
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:11,949
But, you know, I'll take the one win over over 10,000 losses.

782
01:25:11,949 --> 01:25:12,270
Guys.

783
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:20,960
I got nothing else to do today.

784
01:25:21,939 --> 01:25:26,020
We have to burn four hours until the Square Enix concert.

785
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:31,630
The Square Enix fucking conference.

786
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:40,529
And I'm just kind of just sitting here.

787
01:25:42,289 --> 01:25:45,250
Watch the stuff that I missed from the, what about PC?

788
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:46,909
Should we go pee?

789
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:48,029
You want to take a little piss break?

790
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:49,460
All right.

791
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,100
I'll tell you.

792
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,659
I got team who's on these teams.

793
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,119
I didn't, I didn't even see who was on the teams.

794
01:25:57,789 --> 01:25:58,829
Roller Champions.

795
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:08,350
It's at 3 Pacific.

796
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:11,819
All right.

797
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:12,539
Well, let me go pee.

798
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:23,100
How do I turn you off?

799
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:23,340
Okay.

800
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:23,979
You're out.

801
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:24,380
All right.

802
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:24,939
I'll be right back.

803
01:26:25,739 --> 01:26:26,300
I gotta pee.

804
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:28,000
Why is this tiny?

805
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:32,239
All right.

806
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:32,720
Go pee.

807
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:34,319
We'll come back.

808
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:36,000
We'll burn like a few hours somehow.

809
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:39,810
If I actually download Roller Champions,

810
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:43,859
five to six thousand people are going to leave.

811
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:45,779
You probably already, you probably are going to leave anyways

812
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:47,699
because you may have just been here for the conference.

813
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,760
Roller Champions.

814
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:58,529
That will be like a stock market crash straight into the ground.

815
01:26:58,529 --> 01:26:58,850
We'll see.

816
01:26:58,850 --> 01:26:59,729
I'll be right back.
