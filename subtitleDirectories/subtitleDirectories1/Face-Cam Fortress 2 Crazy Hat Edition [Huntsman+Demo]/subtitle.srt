00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Gunther. Welcome to Facecam Fortress 2. I will be your host tonight, not Jerma.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,429
I'm going to be playing as the Huntsman Sniper.

3
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:31,850
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2. Gunther, it's not your time to shine. You'll do that some other time.

4
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:43,380
Three sentries on top of the roof. Excellent. Play it as the Sniper like Gunther told you. On bad water. Didn't get the headshot, but that's okay.

5
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:52,479
Got it. Why am I lagging right now? I'm like lagging. Can you guys see that? Maybe I'm just going crazy.

6
00:00:52,479 --> 00:01:04,840
So I'm wearing this goofy hat today. I know I'm not completely crazy. This is just something I found in my closet. It's actually my father's hat.

7
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:15,140
And I figured, you know what? Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition. I'm going to put on a dumb hat and I'm going to leave it on for the whole entire time.

8
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:26,069
Probably not though, because it's starting to hurt my skull. But my eyes pinched them out. I should have died.

9
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:33,510
We only have a minute and 50 seconds left anyways. Auto balanced. What the heck?

10
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:41,040
Trying to get those mad kills as a... Oh, one of these days that's going to work.

11
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,730
I saw a YouTube video one time where that actually worked very, very well. And if I don't like throw up my mouth, I'll kill this heavy.

12
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:58,780
Drinking too much coffee. Oh, make it three for three. Three for three. Got to get rid of that sentry.

13
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:06,780
And sentry down. Oh my God, I forgot. I totally forgot there was this many sentries. That's four for four.

14
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:14,370
Oh, you spy, you spy F word. Oh, this thing really hurts.

15
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm going to take this off halfway through this and there's going to be a red ring around my whole skull.

16
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:32,639
I'm going to look like Friar Tuck. Here we go. It's going to work. I'm hoping if I get that, you're going to see a pretty ridiculous reaction.

17
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:45,969
You can't run from me, man. How did they not hit him in the face? Don't ask me. Here he is. No, where'd he go?

18
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:55,430
Oh, there's absolutely no way we're going to do this unless like an Uber demo man comes over here.

19
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:06,979
Show yourself. How are we supposed to do this? Look at this chaos.

20
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:14,919
All right. So I have actually, while we just get smoked right here by these five sentries up here, I actually have something to talk about.

21
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:25,419
Oh my God. Hold on. Oh, something in my eye. Oh, this is what happens when you play live. You can't control things like this.

22
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:36,370
Are we good? We're good. So what I want to talk about before my eye gets eaten by a leech or whatever the hell flew into my eye or whatever in my eye.

23
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:45,300
I want to talk about my live stream this weekend because it's actually it's something interesting I want to try and do and it has to do with choose your own adventure.

24
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:55,650
Now bear with me for a second. I want to make a poll every 20 minutes during my live stream tomorrow and I'm going to have like five different options.

25
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,379
So it's going to say eat an egg, do a cartwheel on camera, like play a different game.

26
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:10,379
Like there's going to be five different options you can choose from and whatever one gets the most amount of votes is what I'm going to do.

27
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm going to call it the choose your own adventure live stream with Jerma.

28
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,860
Hopefully that wasn't too loud, but that's what I plan on doing tomorrow.

29
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:24,490
I'm going to iron out some of the details, but it could actually be pretty funny and pretty fun at the same time.

30
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,480
So we'll see how that goes. Pee on that medic.

31
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,480
And by tomorrow I should be able to stream 3D games.

32
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,779
And that's not because I got some magic patch that allowed me to stream 3D games.

33
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:44,519
I'm getting another computer. As ludicrous as that sounds, it's actually true.

34
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:50,819
I'm going to get like a cheap laptop that can stream 3D games. Where is anybody?

35
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:57,819
Cheap laptop, not going to get anything too fancy, but just something enough where I can be confident that I can at least stream games.

36
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,699
And that's something I am... No!

37
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:09,379
Aw, something I'm going to do. So I should be able to do it by tomorrow afternoon.

38
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,379
Heavy, you are spraying everywhere. You look like a real psycho.

39
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:19,279
So let's just roll, huh? Are we just going to roll this card? I'm going forward.

40
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:26,699
I'm moving forward, baby. I stand still for no man.

41
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,519
Where's the team? Did we just really push that far forward?

42
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,529
What just happened with that?

43
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,529
How did I not... Did I put anybody out with that?

44
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:43,279
I swear that didn't put anybody out. I threw it right in the middle of all of us.

45
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,939
Spy? No.

46
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,939
You know, I'd like to kill somebody. That would be fantastic right now.

47
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,519
I can't kill anybody. I'm just like...

48
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,269
Did I not kill that guy?

49
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:03,920
Alright, I'm going to switch. What is happening right now?

50
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,100
I keep hearing like the ding, but I don't kill anyone. Let's just go...

51
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,110
Let's go Demoman.

52
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,110
Uber. Uber. We got a Uber.

53
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,399
Scout, what do you think you're doing, boy?

54
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,300
New rank. New rank.

55
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,850
That guy flew a thousand feet in the air.

56
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,850
Dr. Sandvich, the hack master.

57
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:52,839
Alright, this thing is really starting to concave my skull. I have to get this thing off.

58
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,589
Oh, by the way, if you're wondering, they're right here.

59
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:01,279
It's not like they're in some case somewhere.

60
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,279
My gunner optics are sitting right here.

61
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,279
And a lot of people ask, Jerma, why do you not wear those during your face cam sessions?

62
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,279
I feel like they kind of make my face look a little different.

63
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,279
I'd rather have you guys see the real me rather than the glasses me.

64
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,100
Because I don't think I look very good in glasses. I think I look pretty bad.

65
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,170
Oh, this spy. Let's watch it. Oh, nice backstab there, dude.

66
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:33,720
Nice. Lock and load.

67
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,279
Miss twice. Miss again. Run.

68
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,279
Brain freeze. Brain freeze. I'm not even drinking that cold of a drink and I just got brain freeze.

69
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,170
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Only two and a half minutes left and we win.

70
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:59,540
Look at this engineer insanity. Two dispensers, three engineers, two...

71
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,850
Wow. You have to be a spy.

72
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,600
I always do that. I always think that somebody's a spy when they're just not.

73
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
But this guy has to be. Yes, of course he is.

74
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:16,180
Of course he does the thing where I... Wait. Wait. I think he went down here.

75
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:22,220
You know what? I'm not going on a wild goose chase right now. I got stuff to do.

76
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,910
Oh, and there he is. That's one way to do it.

77
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:40,720
Oh, don't you dare. Oh. Oh, yeah.

78
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,149
Oh, that was so satisfying. I love doing that. It's so much fun.

79
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:52,490
The lock and load is just too fun. Did I just kill two people with that?

80
00:08:52,490 --> 00:09:00,149
Yikes. Come on. Show your bloody face.

81
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:09,129
Whoa. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Miss. Wow.

82
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:19,299
Oh, but I love that same spy again. Oh, that's just depressing.

83
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:25,259
Have I been killed by three spy revolvers in a row? I really think I might have.

84
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:33,720
Just dink, dink, dink. Oh, don't let them get this.

85
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,919
Do not let... I'm going to be very upset if they get this.

86
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:44,559
I might, in fact, puke blood. That would be horrible.

87
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:51,090
Let's go straight down the line. Straight down the line with the lock and load.

88
00:09:51,090 --> 00:10:04,190
Oh, will he do a backflip for me? Where are you going? Where are you going?

89
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:15,070
Where are you going? 16 seconds left. Come here. Come over here.

90
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,889
Oh. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. I think we won.

91
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:26,860
Over time, you're going to make me spit my coffee on the screen.

92
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:37,210
I will see you guys all next time. Thanks for watching so much.

93
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,210
And stay tuned for the livestream tomorrow. I might have explained that very, very strangely,

94
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,210
but it's going to be a choose-your-own-adventure livestream.

95
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,620
I will explain in better detail tomorrow when it happens, but it should be pretty fun.

96
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,620
So thanks so much, guys, for watching. I'll see you guys all soon.

97
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
And, of course, take care, everybody.
