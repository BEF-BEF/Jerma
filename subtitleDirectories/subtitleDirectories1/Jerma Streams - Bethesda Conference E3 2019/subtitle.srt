1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:07,500
I'll put it on the screen so you don't miss anything. Where is it? Where is it? Okay, come on. Go go go go go go go go go go go

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:30,089
I can't miss this and then it's in bed. Did it work? All right. Just you watch that. I'll be right back

3
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:57,109
I gotta pee. Why is it doing this? Is it broken? Wrong stream? Which is it just Bethesda?

4
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,480
Oh my god, just give me this. All right. I'll be right back. Just just relax. I'll be right back.

5
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,459
Okay, I got something. I got something. Do it. Do it.

6
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,340
Bethesda seems they've done a good job at sometimes like pulling these surprises out, right?

7
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,019
Even fallout 76 I think was like kind of a surprise. What if we saw a Bethesda who has a

8
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:47,500
many awesome worlds? What if we saw Bethesda auto chess? Wow, that was really... I think

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,060
this is serious. We're apparently less than a minute so your final thoughts. We're just

10
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,299
naming games we enjoy and asking Bethesda. Can you make Pokemon snap Bethesda, please?

11
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:06,260
A shinder made by Bethesda. Wishing well. I want Rio to start just off. Wow, Bethesda.

12
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,960
I think we'll find Elder Scrolls online. What? Yeah, we'll see a little bit more about that.

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:21,479
They released earlier their lineup for this year. Even within three. Be together.

14
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,280
That is what we are about to be for the Bethesda E3 showcase right here E3 on Twitch. It is day

15
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,599
one 2019. We still have so much coming at you this entire week. We hope that you'll enjoy

16
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,639
this next press conference. We'll be back afterwards for the post-press conference

17
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,000
or we won't. You'll be with Drop Frames. You'll find out when that actually happens.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,919
Don't forget we also got Devolver and the pre-free show. Ladies and gentlemen,

19
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,319
enjoy the next press conference of day number one. But don't forget we have just got started.

20
00:02:49,319 --> 00:03:45,699
It is time now for Bethesda. There is no game without the players. Really, it all comes down

21
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:54,580
to you. There is no game. There's no one to play it. No one to interact with it.

22
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:07,189
Keep us in check. And we appreciate that. And through all of it, you're always there with us.

23
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:12,069
Damn it, man. I pissed all over the toilet. I had to clean it up. It was bad.

24
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,300
I fucking, it was out of control. It wouldn't stop.

25
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:32,100
I used to take a week off every time Bethesda game came out.

26
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,139
My name is Mark Diaz and when I was eight years old, I used to sneak over to my

27
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:40,459
buddy's house to play Doom. I'm Rich Lambert. Daggerfall was one of the very first games

28
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:44,540
that got me into the Elder Scrolls world. I'm Dana Christo and I started out as a

29
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,740
16-year-old gamer who just wanted to bring joy to others through video games.

30
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,860
And now I'm game director at Arkane Studios. Now I'm a game programmer anywhere.

31
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,500
Now I get to be a part of building that world as the creative director on Elder Scrolls Online.

32
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,259
Now I'm a UI programmer at Bethesda Game Studios and it's everything I could have dreamed of.

33
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:09,740
I see you. I see you. I see you. We see you because we are you. And together. Together.

34
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,860
Together. We are all. We are all.

35
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:26,819
It's our Andrew W.K. Party, party, party, it's time. Right?

36
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,189
This is not Awkward Teen.

37
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,389
That is our, yeah, that is like the Andrew W.K. Awkward Teen.

38
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:17,209
Too loud. I got you. I got you. I got you.

39
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:34,420
That was three games. Yes. Thank you. One of them nobody likes.

40
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,730
Here he comes. Oh.

41
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:07,110
Yeah. Thank you guys for being here. Thank everyone watching around the world

42
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,990
to tuning in to watch our fifth annual E3 showcase.

43
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:18,600
You're welcome. We're here for you. This is a night dedicated to those who love games,

44
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,240
who love the incredible entertainment that games provide.

45
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,480
This past year you fought demons on Mars and Nazis in America.

46
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:34,740
You were assassins in the Empire, adventurers in Tamriel, and survivors in the wasteland.

47
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,540
And you've embarked on these amazing adventures on PC, console, VR, mobile,

48
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,060
or wherever and however you choose to play. And that's the key. You take the worlds that

49
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,660
we create and you make them yours. You share your experiences with other players, with

50
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,899
friends and with family. With our games you've built large global communities that truly matter.

51
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,939
This year we want to give special recognition to the extraordinary Bethesda community.

52
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,860
As you showed, as you saw in our opening video, you mean everything to us.

53
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,980
I've almost been at this company for 20 years. And when I first started.

54
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,660
I do? Oh, I mean, I mean everything.

55
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:29,899
First started, one of my first responsibilities was moderating the community forums, chatting with

56
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:34,460
you and keeping you up to date on our games. It was a great way to start my career at Bethesda

57
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,100
because it was the perfect reminder of why we do what we do. And like so many others at

58
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,779
Bethesda, I've spent a lot of time with you at events around the world. Is that him?

59
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,820
I've enjoyed meeting so many of you. Is that him from like 20 years ago?

60
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,179
Oh, first, all right, never mind.

61
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,139
Taking time throughout the show,

62
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:51,899
let's do what I used to do in the Bethesda community.

63
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,460
We are thrilled tonight to show our fans the lineup of great games we've been creating

64
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,460
just for you, including the premiere of some exciting new games. And we'll go deep on Doom

65
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:14,659
Eternal. Stop cheering. They didn't see anything yet. So if you're ready, let's show you

66
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,620
like a screenshot of concrete. And he's still going to cheer.

67
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,059
One of the most celebrated development studios in the world, Bethesda Game Studios.

68
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,659
Please welcome studio head and my good friend, Todd Howard.

69
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,870
I don't know. I can't even look at him. I can't even look at the screen.

70
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,480
Is he there? Is he there yet? Tell me when he's there.

71
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:45,220
Thank you. Great to see everybody.

72
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,720
Hey, Todd.

73
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,059
We have had an incredibly exciting year at Bethesda Game Studios.

74
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,820
Given some of that excitement, impressed you're still here.

75
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:06,740
Actually, over the last year, we've had over 60 million players in our games.

76
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,779
And it's all of you.

77
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:25,659
It's all of you who have made these worlds what they are. Take Fallout 76.

78
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:32,120
All right. This is a good one.

79
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:38,789
A type of game we'd never done before. Had a lot of difficulties at launch.

80
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,659
Like this.

81
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,899
A lot of well-deserved criticism.

82
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,899
And you kept playing it. And through all of that, something amazing has happened.

83
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:03,779
It's thanks to all of you. This game has one of the best online communities we've ever seen.

84
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,940
It's me, my mom, my grandma.

85
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,220
And everybody's nice to each other.

86
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,659
They don't go on killing griefing sprees.

87
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:16,379
They leave food and water for the newbies and wave to each other.

88
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,179
I don't know about you.

89
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,330
Come on. Come on.

90
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,809
I paid good money for these seats.

91
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:31,450
We're in store this year for Fallout 76.

92
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,730
But first, our latest game, The Elder Scrolls Blades, is in early access.

93
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,049
And thanks to all of you, it became our second straight

94
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,929
number one mobile game after Fallout Shelter.

95
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:45,049
Absolutely incredible.

96
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:47,289
This is the only game I've ever played in my life.

97
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,529
I'm not kidding. This is a full, real statement.

98
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,370
Within 25 minutes, the iPad hit me almost in the face because I fell asleep.

99
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,370
I fell asleep playing the game.

100
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,570
I actually went to bed.

101
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,490
Like I passed out asleep and the iPad went like right on my bed.

102
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,289
I've never done that before.

103
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,690
It's really good sleeping.

104
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,690
And thanks again to all of you for making Blades number one.

105
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,809
I didn't even get past this tutorial.

106
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,129
Someone who's worked on The Elder Scrolls for 20 years.

107
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:18,490
It might be good. I don't know.

108
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,009
To bring this world to your friends in an all new way.

109
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,330
We still love those classic dungeon crawlers and it's clear you do as well.

110
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,769
And whether you're exploring a dungeon or rebuilding your town,

111
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,850
it's great to be able to do it wherever you are.

112
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:36,009
Since it's E3, we're releasing our biggest update yet.

113
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:38,970
Featuring all new jobs and solo arena battles.

114
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,929
Jobs? We're getting more jobs here.

115
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,690
And a brand new dragon quest line.

116
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,289
What we understand is the unemployment rate in The Elder Scrolls Blades

117
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,049
is by far the lowest it's ever been.

118
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,009
It has even more, but best of all, it's coming out tonight.

119
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:04,389
So download free tonight and give it a try.

120
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,669
And we're also hard at work on our arena mode for this fall.

121
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:14,309
We'll feature PvP, your own guilds, and visiting your friends' towns.

122
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:18,870
But most exciting this year, we're also bringing Blades to an all-new platform.

123
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,590
Switch Blades.

124
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,779
That's, who cares?

125
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,059
If you don't have a phone, you know what I mean?

126
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,379
If you were going to play this, you would have played it on your phone.

127
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:42,139
Everybody has a phone. What, you guys don't have phones?

128
00:13:47,899 --> 00:14:01,139
Right? Is this the new Skyrim?

129
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,500
Are they going to release this like 12 times?

130
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,059
Blades is coming this fall to the Nintendo Switch.

131
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,659
And yes, it's still free.

132
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,740
Thank god.

133
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,100
If it was money, I would have been upset about that.

134
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,220
For the Switch, you can play on the go, on your TV, and with motion controls.

135
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,139
But best of all, it's cross-play and cross-progression with the mobile version.

136
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:22,539
So you can...

137
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,629
People are real fucking excited about this.

138
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:29,750
So you can start tonight on mobile and all your progress will carry over.

139
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,909
And it's viable here in our booth and Nintendos.

140
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:34,389
Yeah.

141
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,309
Between my iPhone and my Switch.

142
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,230
Oh, help. Somebody help.

143
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:46,309
We also have some special rewards for both our Apple and Google players this week.

144
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:47,669
They're paid actors.

145
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,110
And let us know what you think.

146
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,669
Thanks again.

147
00:14:55,539 --> 00:15:00,820
Now, let me introduce Jeff and Tom to tell you what's coming to Fallout 76.

148
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:12,860
There are some really excited people here.

149
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,980
Hi, I'm project leader Jeff Garter.

150
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,059
And I'm co-studio director Tom Mustaine.

151
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,299
On behalf of everyone at Bethesda Game Studios,

152
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:24,620
we want to thank the millions of you who have played with us,

153
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:29,019
stuck with us, and helped shape the world of Fallout 76.

154
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,139
Absolutely.

155
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,740
It's incredible what the game has become.

156
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,899
You've told us how much you've loved this year's updates so far.

157
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,419
From camp building, legendary weapons, player vending,

158
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,580
and of course, the dreaded Sheep Squatch.

159
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,419
Sheep Squatch.

160
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,940
We've also been working on our biggest update yet.

161
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,620
It's called Wastelanders.

162
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:58,220
And it will fundamentally change the game.

163
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,340
All I remember is Rick and Morty played this.

164
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,620
That's it.

165
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,340
I don't know anything else about this.

166
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,940
76 opened its door.

167
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:10,059
This is like a Rick and Morty play this game.

168
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,299
We all discovered that Appalachia isn't quite what it used to be.

169
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,100
I'll get out of the way.

170
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,179
We encountered a lot of things.

171
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,940
Some people are interested.

172
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,580
Overcame a lot of things.

173
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:26,379
I don't think any of us expected for people to actually come back.

174
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,019
Are you from that vault?

175
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,779
Can you help us?

176
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,019
We've traveled pretty far.

177
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,200
I heard there's hope here in Appalachia.

178
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,600
Folk rebuilding.

179
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,639
I mean, nobody cares?

180
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,179
We'll fight too.

181
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:47,419
What, do you think this is like a giant astroturf?

182
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,730
Didn't you say there was like a million players?

183
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:54,039
We've been seen everything.

184
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,639
And the one thing we've learned is this.

185
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,559
You got to claim the wasteland before it claims you.

186
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,019
Question is, are you with us?

187
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:08,779
With them.

188
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,460
You guys think this pumped in crowd sounds?

189
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:29,900
No, no, it's not.

190
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,700
Human NPCs are coming to Fallout 76.

191
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:36,250
Heck yeah.

192
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:45,609
Not just NPCs, but a full quest line, new rewards, and as you saw, full dialogue trees.

193
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:53,349
This is a long-term story we're telling.

194
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:58,470
Year one was about the vault doors opening and all of you settling the wasteland.

195
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,670
Year two is about people coming back to reclaim it.

196
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,869
Like previous Fallout games, these characters have their own stories and goals.

197
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:11,029
It's up to you to choose how to interact with them and live with those consequences.

198
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:17,430
The Wastelanders update is coming this fall and will be free for all Fallout 76 players.

199
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:18,549
Fall?

200
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:20,940
That's kind of a ways away.

201
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,400
And in the spirit of free, we're doing something special just for E3.

202
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,599
Fallout 76 is going to have a free trial for everyone starting tomorrow.

203
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,200
It's free for a week.

204
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:40,789
And let me tell you what we're doing with Fallout 76.

205
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,950
It's going free for one week.

206
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,190
And it's growing community have become.

207
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,269
We can't wait to welcome all of you.

208
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:53,910
And because so many of you are going to be joining us,

209
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,869
we thought we'd also give you a sneak peek this week at an all-new game mode.

210
00:18:58,869 --> 00:18:59,430
Check it out.

211
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,619
Your first test was making it to the vault.

212
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,460
Now, your real trial begins.

213
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:16,539
I wouldn't be surprised.

214
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,779
Here are vault 51.

215
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:26,549
Perhaps you will be the one nuclear winter.

216
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:29,829
We are in serious need of leadership.

217
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:33,109
So I have devised a unique process.

218
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:41,589
A battle to the death is the only sure way to judge the superior candidate.

219
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,069
This should prove interesting.

220
00:19:49,430 --> 00:20:00,150
This is what we call in the industry, a pivot.

221
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:43,049
There could only be one overseer.

222
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:44,970
Good luck.

223
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,700
Fallout 76 pivoted to a PR game mode.

224
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,500
Just like Fortnite, it'll probably be the only thing that anyone plays.

225
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,019
We put a battle royale in Fallout 76.

226
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:06,250
How do they censor and stuff?

227
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,930
Nuclear winter is a battle royale born from the Fallout universe.

228
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,609
From power armor to perk cards.

229
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:14,970
From camp building to contending with wasteland creatures.

230
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,769
And of course, my personal favorite, nukes.

231
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,890
It's a great free addition to an already huge game.

232
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,049
We love playing it and we think you will too.

233
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:30,410
That guy wasn't excited.

234
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,769
That guy got burnt.

235
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,250
So he dropped the cigarette on his lap.

236
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,369
Remember all of Fallout 76, including nuclear winter,

237
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:41,609
is free to try this week.

238
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:44,569
Somebody took their bare feet, took their shoes off,

239
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,130
put their ice cold bare feet on that guy's back.

240
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:51,579
Jump in tomorrow.

241
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,180
We can't wait to see you.

242
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,740
Thanks again.

243
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,799
Fucking PR mode.

244
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:07,130
Everything we've talked about that's coming this year is free.

245
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:07,930
I like that jacket.

246
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:12,569
We get to represent hundreds of passionate developers across

247
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:16,650
four studio locations in North America working on multiple projects.

248
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,890
Yes, we're still hard at work on our next-gen RPG, Starfield.

249
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:24,089
And of course, Elder Scrolls 6.

250
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,319
We know how precious these game worlds are to all of you.

251
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,200
And they are to us.

252
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,039
We know the time you spend in them is important.

253
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,440
Keep telling us what you love, what you'd like to see us do better.

254
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,160
Thank you again, everybody, for your support.

255
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,400
But really, even more so, I want to thank everybody for believing in us.

256
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,799
Thank you.

257
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,039
Is that the end?

258
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,130
Is that the end?

259
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,220
Please welcome the Foul Gameworks, Mr. Shinji Mikami.

260
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:07,779
I was going to say that's not very good.

261
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,880
What's Tango Gameworks?

262
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,000
What do they do?

263
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,640
I'd like to start by greeting my team in Tokyo.

264
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,599
Tango Gameworks.

265
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,240
What do they make?

266
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,599
It's Monday morning there, but they are watching.

267
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,240
Evil Within.

268
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,059
Evil Within.

269
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,589
I am not a big fan of that game.

270
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:49,349
I am excited to announce the next game from Tango.

271
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,609
Ghostwire, Tokyo.

272
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:54,170
Ghostwire.

273
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,579
Hold on.

274
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:58,339
Wait, we got something.

275
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:58,900
This is new.

276
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,099
This is new.

277
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:02,099
Hold your judgments here.

278
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:03,299
Hold on.

279
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:09,539
It is an action-adventure game in which you will fight paranormal enemies

280
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,980
and rid the city of supernatural evil.

281
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,859
I think you'll love it.

282
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:16,099
Okay.

283
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:24,380
That guy definitely has a camera pointed at him.

284
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,420
I'm going to upload it later.

285
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,099
Ghostwire, Tokyo.

286
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,500
Here is creative director at Tango.

287
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:34,900
Come on.

288
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:37,220
This ain't even Cox doing this.

289
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,420
This is just a bad feed.

290
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,130
All right.

291
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:41,609
Let's see.

292
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:42,970
I'm intrigued.

293
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,970
I'm very intrigued.

294
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,769
I'm very intrigued about this.

295
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:06,869
It's hard to do.

296
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:10,759
It's hard to do.

297
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,519
People are vanishing in Tokyo.

298
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,920
You must find out why.

299
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,400
Spooky.

300
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,519
You have to explore the world.

301
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,880
Face challenges to uncover the truth and save humanity.

302
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,359
In the game, you will meet spirits, some dangerous, some peaceful,

303
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,559
and survivors that each have their own stories.

304
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,839
You will need to ask yourself.

305
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,039
It is normal or paranormal.

306
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,640
This is Men in Black?

307
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,640
This is Men in Black.

308
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,240
The aliens are among us and you have to find out who's an alien or who's a ghost.

309
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,519
I just missed a really good joke.

310
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
We are very excited.

311
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,279
Let's take a look.

312
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,119
Thank you.

313
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,630
Let's take a look.

314
00:26:22,630 --> 00:27:10,410
What happened?

315
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:14,619
Was it the rapture?

316
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:42,950
That was pretty cool.

317
00:27:43,589 --> 00:28:03,859
Don't fear the unknown.

318
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,450
Attack it.

319
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,869
I'm interested.

320
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:20,869
That looks different.

321
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:21,589
Looks interesting.

322
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,519
No gameplay or anything.

323
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,359
I work as a mechanical engineer.

324
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,400
I work in a hospital.

325
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,359
I used to work with kids.

326
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,160
Interesting concept.

327
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,200
I'm an electrician.

328
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
I'm an event planner.

329
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,440
In real life, I'm a systems administrator.

330
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,920
Program assistant for a private school for children with autism.

331
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,960
I'm trying to be an artist.

332
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,880
I like to think of myself as one.

333
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,319
Make like back-end systems that it's really fun.

334
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,039
I'm a streamer.

335
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,559
I'm a streamer.

336
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,519
Maybe permanently or temporarily.

337
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,799
I'm a full-time streamer.

338
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,400
I got a YouTube channel.

339
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,519
I make my own yarn.

340
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,960
I'm a social worker.

341
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,480
Teaching inmates.

342
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,519
I'm a game developer.

343
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,960
Working at a video game cafe.

344
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,359
I've been a Doom fan since the game came out.

345
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,279
I remember being in the eighth grade and a buddy of mine gave me the shareware demo

346
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,000
on three and a half inch floppy disks.

347
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,880
My older brother picked up Fallout 3 and I took his copy and played it when he wasn't home.

348
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,519
Fallout 4.

349
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,720
Oh, it was in Boston.

350
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,279
I like Boston.

351
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,359
The scope of that game was just like a lot bigger than things I was used to.

352
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,480
Just setting foot in Shimmering, the first city that you go to in Somerset,

353
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,559
it was amazing.

354
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,039
You would look out and you'd be like, oh, I want to go there.

355
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:35,720
And then you could go there, which was wild.

356
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,759
Go out into the world.

357
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,759
Just go in any direction that you want to go.

358
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,359
The exploration and the weirdness and the alienness of it.

359
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,319
I played Oblivion.

360
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,319
I tell you, it probably saved my life.

361
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,960
It was one of my first experiences with a fantasy world that was that immersive.

362
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,559
Love the dragons.

363
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,599
Gather the dragons.

364
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,400
When you take down a dragon, you can definitely take down any illness.

365
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,759
Don't ever stop adding dragons to your game.

366
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:00,119
Add dragons to Fallout.

367
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,400
Add dragons to Rage.

368
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Add dragons to everything.

369
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,119
I'm a dragon.

370
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,079
Mecha dragons.

371
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,119
I'm a dragon.

372
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,839
More dragons.

373
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,440
Stop doing that.

374
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,500
We want Doom.

375
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,380
You'll get it.

376
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,900
Doom's coming up in like 10 minutes.

377
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,180
Probably not even.

378
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:44,470
I just want to shout out to our friend Greg there,

379
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,470
the one in the video that really loves dragons.

380
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,789
I'm happy to say, Greg, The Elder Scrolls Online has dragons.

381
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,079
I don't mean any disrespect by this at all.

382
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,680
Right now, in fact, players are decent to the season of the dragon.

383
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,279
Our year-long story about greed, revenge, cat people, and of course, dragons.

384
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,829
Tonight's focus on the community resonates with me and everyone at Xenomax Online Studios

385
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,750
because ESO literally would not exist without you.

386
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,470
Watching you play the game, streaming, telling stories, hearing your feedback,

387
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,670
we understand that you are the most important part of the world of Tamriel.

388
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,789
It's fun, and it's fun, right?

389
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,410
Thank you.

390
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,930
Thank you for making ESO the extraordinary adventure it is today.

391
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,930
The past year has been a huge success for ESO.

392
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,529
More Game of the Year awards.

393
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,210
Millions more players have joined.

394
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:50,089
So many, in fact, that we recently had more server capacity just to support

395
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,890
all the new players in Tamriel.

396
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,890
I just want to make sure we say, can I just say this?

397
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,650
Can we please stop serving alcohol?

398
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:00,170
Before the show's getting bigger and better.

399
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:00,890
Come on.

400
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,569
Just a few days ago, we launched the Elder Scrolls Online Elsewhere,

401
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:12,059
the latest chapter in the game where you're able to visit, for the first time,

402
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:16,299
the homeland of the Khajiit, as well as control the dead as the new Necromancer class.

403
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:23,180
And if you haven't played it yet, Elsewhere is the perfect starting point for new players.

404
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,410
When we announced Season of the Dragon, we kicked it off by showing you a video

405
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:35,049
about how dragons were unleashed on Elsewhere and we ended with a cliffhanger.

406
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:36,329
I feel like that guy doesn't have a shirt on.

407
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,569
I'm really excited to show you what happens next.

408
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:42,890
I feel like that guy has like a football kind of logo painted on his chest

409
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,930
and he's got like a full paint on his face.

410
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,970
He's got like horns on.

411
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,170
He's just screaming in the crowd.

412
00:32:49,369 --> 00:33:50,630
For a second, I just, I was like, what is going on?

413
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:52,869
It's just a cat.

414
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:55,640
I forgot this is Elder Scrolls.

415
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,300
Nice.

416
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,579
I don't know about the umbrella.

417
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,260
Thief.

418
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,599
Oh, magnificent Smaug.

419
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,559
Your impressive body is none other than I could ever see before.

420
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,150
Nice.

421
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:32,099
Dude, that was so awesome.

422
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,980
Why don't we take a look and see how that scenario would play out in the actual game.

423
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:55,289
That's right.

424
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:00,219
You may have recognized the return of Sai Sahan,

425
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,300
the legendary Redguard Swordmaster.

426
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:07,849
He's the legendary Redguard Swordmaster you met as part of the original five companions.

427
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:10,409
He's back as the leader of the Dragon Guard,

428
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:15,539
a group of dragon hunting warriors you've seen in other Elder Scrolls games.

429
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,300
He'll be featured in our fourth quarter story DLC named Dragonhold,

430
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,119
which will complete the season of the dragon.

431
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,880
We've got a lot more to share about the return of Sai and the Dragon Guard,

432
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,360
which will unveil at QuakeCon later this summer.

433
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,679
This guy's gonna call his mom later and be like,

434
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:37,320
Mom, mom, it's been wild.

435
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,840
Sorry, I got Larry tight.

436
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,440
I've been fucking screaming.

437
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,960
They did not introduce two new dragons.

438
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,199
They introduced a new cat.

439
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,840
I can't believe it.

440
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,440
All right, I'll talk to you later.

441
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,079
Love you, mom.

442
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:49,559
So much for your support of the Elder Scrolls online.

443
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,639
We're humbled by your enthusiasm.

444
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,159
Your enthusiasm for the game motivates us every day.

445
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,840
You guys are seriously awesome.

446
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,340
Thank you.

447
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,460
Dust is gonna start coming out of this guy's throat.

448
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,739
I'm concerned for this dude's health.

449
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,480
He's gonna be like coughing up the sand.

450
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,440
I have something else to talk about.

451
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,059
The Elder Scrolls online isn't the only game in development at ZeniMax online studios.

452
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,340
We have several other projects, one of which we're ready to reveal tonight.

453
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:24,380
And to tell us all about it is the game's creative director, Kira Schlitt.

454
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:26,320
New game.

455
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:29,460
All right, new game.

456
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,960
And now for something completely different.

457
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,340
Yarn Free.

458
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:46,980
Whatever it's called.

459
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,019
A classic Saturday morning cartoon in free-to-play mobile game form.

460
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:53,380
Let's take a look.

461
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,760
What?

462
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,400
Saturday morning mobile free...

463
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,340
TV?

464
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,820
Commander Keen.

465
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:27,539
This feels like a fake game trailer.

466
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:28,900
That's gonna be like another reveal.

467
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,340
This is a bait, I think.

468
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:47,800
Didn't it feel kind of like it was gonna bleed into something else?

469
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,599
That was gonna be like, I mean Commander Keen, whatever.

470
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:56,019
So there's a new branch on Commander Keen's family tree,

471
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,340
and they're heading to iOS and Android.

472
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:01,619
If you're hearing about Commander Keen for the first time,

473
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:06,659
it was one of the first PC action games created by id Software in the early 90s.

474
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:08,119
Yeah.

475
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:17,000
It starred boy genius Billy Blaze, whose alter ego Commander Keen protected Earth.

476
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,880
I thought it was like Mark Keen.

477
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,599
Want to give a really big thanks to our friends at id

478
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:26,679
for trusting us to deliver our modern take on this classic game.

479
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:38,010
So tonight, as we introduce Commander Keen to a new generation of players,

480
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,690
we're also introducing the next generation of heroes.

481
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,409
Meet Billy.

482
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:44,969
Billy Keen.

483
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:47,289
Billy and Billy Keen.

484
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:50,170
Two geniuses who follow in their famous father's footsteps.

485
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:50,969
Is that Fortnite dance?

486
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:53,929
The new commanders are of course funny and powerful,

487
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:59,449
but the game is also full of enemies, allies, and some really bad bad guys.

488
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,010
The twins build wacky gadgets from household items

489
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,730
to save the Earth from certain alien destruction.

490
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:09,690
Drag and drop gadgets to summon allies,

491
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,449
attack enemies, and move through the environment.

492
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:16,570
Choose from a caboodle of contraptions to conquer challenges,

493
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,170
and try saying that five times fast.

494
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:21,849
The tomes go on adventures and stories,

495
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:24,409
which tell some of the classic Commander Keen tales,

496
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:27,690
as well as a whole bunch of brand new ones.

497
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,570
In story mode, you'll overcome aliens,

498
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:34,010
collect power-ups, and explore Mars and beyond.

499
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:39,769
You can also go helmet to helmet with other players in battle mode.

500
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:43,610
A real-time head-to-head race through an alien landscape

501
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,690
where you need to control checkpoints

502
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,730
and claim the flag to gain ultimate victory.

503
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:55,050
Commander Keen will soft launch this summer on iOS and Android phones.

504
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,409
You don't know the worst part about this.

505
00:41:56,409 --> 00:41:59,610
It's not the fact that everyone's like, oh bad Beth.

506
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:04,250
You guys realize that mobile games like that make more money

507
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,849
than like God of War did probably.

508
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:09,849
Unique in-game rewards and hot Commander Keen launch updates.

509
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:15,050
We really can't wait to kick some asteroid with you all.

510
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,570
That game is going to make more money

511
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:20,170
than the global fucking theater run of Avatar.

512
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,409
That's just the way it is.

513
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,289
That's just the way it is now.

514
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,070
We, like you, love mobile games.

515
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,030
In addition to Blades and the upcoming Commander Keen,

516
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,349
millions of you have enjoyed Fallout Shelter,

517
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:43,510
which has now reached over 150 million downloads and counting.

518
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,190
I told you, how many people saw Avatar?

519
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:49,079
How many people saw the movie Avatar?

520
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,760
For fans of collectible card games,

521
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,599
we brought the Elder Scrolls Legends to mobile

522
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,159
so you could experience the Elder Scrolls in a new way.

523
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:58,840
This year, the Legends community has continued to grow

524
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,519
and a lot of upgrades, new features, and new content.

525
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,840
It's a great experience for a night of gaming

526
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
or a quick match over a cup of coffee.

527
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,320
I gotta get out of here.

528
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,280
Oh no, it's taking over.

529
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,199
It's over, guys.

530
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,079
Mobile is the new, it's taking over.

531
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:48,710
Somebody said, no, what if we like,

532
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:50,550
it's not gonna work.

533
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,349
You can be upset about this, but you understand something.

534
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:56,869
You're just one person and a hundred grandmas

535
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:57,989
are gonna fucking download this.

536
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,260
You think you could win against a hundred grandmas?

537
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,219
I don't think you could.

538
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:33,260
They want like everybody to be playing this in homeroom.

539
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:39,610
But I told you, that's gonna be a fucking homework reminder.

540
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:53,050
Got reported?

541
00:44:53,690 --> 00:45:12,340
It's the future, guys.

542
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,059
See, dragons.

543
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:13,699
It's the future.

544
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,619
If you enjoy other card games

545
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,219
but are looking for something that provides

546
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,420
a little deeper challenge,

547
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,579
you can download Legends for free on the App Store

548
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:22,940
and begin playing tonight.

549
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:26,139
Legends' next expansion, Moons of Elsewhere,

550
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:31,019
will be available on June 27th for PC, Mac, Mobile, and Tablet.

551
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,300
You can head over to BethesdaNet

552
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,139
to get a glimpse of the new cards and content

553
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:35,340
or play it this week in our booth.

554
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,619
There's two different mobiles now.

555
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:37,579
I'll see you there.

556
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:38,780
It's Mobile and Tablet.

557
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,860
Aren't they both mobile?

558
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:44,059
Breaking them up.

559
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:45,260
Speaking of new content,

560
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,139
three weeks ago we released Rage 2

561
00:45:48,139 --> 00:45:55,590
and now Insanity rules for millions of players

562
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,710
around the world.

563
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,949
But we wanted to do more than just deliver

564
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:01,030
a critically acclaimed open world shooter.

565
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,510
We've already added community challenges

566
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,989
that reward you just for having fun in the wasteland

567
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:07,829
and we've got a lot more planned

568
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:10,469
with new features rolling out this week.

569
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:10,789
Porn?

570
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:13,429
The world of Rage 2 will become even more unpredictable.

571
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:14,869
I wish I was watching porn.

572
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:15,510
What did that say?

573
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:43,960
Puke explosions.

574
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:46,710
Don't say shit.

575
00:46:47,349 --> 00:47:12,460
I'm not gonna play Andrew WK.

576
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,820
I got yelled at last year

577
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,940
for doing that too many times.

578
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:46,380
New cheats.

579
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,340
Surprise for you all.

580
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:19,369
No, I'm not gonna do that.

581
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,250
That's something blue.

582
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,010
That's fucking blue.

583
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:22,730
I'm not doing that.

584
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:26,090
Please welcome executive producer at Machine Games,

585
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,530
Jörg Gustafsson.

586
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:42,500
After liberating America from the Nazi scum

587
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,219
in Wolfenstein 2, the new Colossus.

588
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:46,179
Wolfenstein 3.

589
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:52,840
This year we take you back to Europe

590
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,400
with two new Wolfenstein games.

591
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,800
First, we are bringing Nazi killing

592
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:08,170
into virtual reality with Wolfenstein cyber pilot.

593
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,730
As a hacker working for the French resistance,

594
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,690
you will take control of Nazi war machines

595
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,409
and turn them against their creators.

596
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,409
Cyber pilot will be available this July

597
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:26,889
and it's playable this week in our e-free booth.

598
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:37,670
And if you haven't fought Nazis in VR,

599
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,190
you don't know what you are missing.

600
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:45,900
As I said, we have two new Wolfenstein games.

601
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,039
This summer, we are going to be launching

602
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:51,719
Wolfenstein Youngblood.

603
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:53,880
Wolfenstein Youngblood.

604
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:59,210
Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein, and then Wolfenstein,

605
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,090
another Wolfenstein.

606
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,730
With a gameplay experience that is bigger

607
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,809
than any previous Wolfenstein game,

608
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,650
you will have more weapons and weapon upgrades

609
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,010
than ever before, more ways to customize

610
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,969
your play style, and of course,

611
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:17,530
even more evil Nazis to kill.

612
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:22,309
What is it for?

613
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,789
It's not a tablet.

614
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:27,510
In Youngblood, you can kill those Nazis

615
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:28,469
with a friend.

616
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,179
You couldn't do that in Wolfenstein 2?

617
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:33,139
Was it on Singapore?

618
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,510
Yes, Wolfenstein is going co-op.

619
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:42,010
Youngblood is set in the 1980s,

620
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,570
two decades after the new Colossus.

621
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,929
BJ Blazkowicz is missing in Nazi-occupied Paris

622
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,969
and it's up to his twin daughters,

623
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:56,090
Jess and Soph, to track him down.

624
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,769
In Youngblood, you can still play by yourself

625
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,210
or you can partner with a pal

626
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,170
to double up on shooting, stabbing,

627
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,369
and killing Nazis.

628
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:11,380
Check it out.

629
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:19,639
Nazi country.

630
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,599
That's where Papa is,

631
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:23,960
so that's where we're going.

632
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,079
We can find him together.

633
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:31,659
I may have an assignment suitable

634
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:32,619
for two Nazi killers.

635
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:34,539
Do we get to kill Nazis in this one?

636
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:37,579
Somebody said, uh, I think, probably.

637
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:38,219
I think so.

638
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,019
Wolfenstein Youngblood releases on PlayStation 4,

639
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,739
Xbox One, Nintendo Switch,

640
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:10,780
and PC on July 26th.

641
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,340
I mean, that comes out like now,

642
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,539
in like less than a month and a half.

643
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:18,579
And if you can't wait,

644
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:21,139
stop by our E3 booth to play this week.

645
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,179
Thank you.

646
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,800
And now I'd like to welcome to the stage

647
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,039
my dear friends from Arcane Lyon

648
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:39,050
who worked with us on these two Wolfenstein games,

649
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,730
Dinga and Sébastien.

650
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,510
Did I mute myself?

651
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,980
No, I didn't mute myself.

652
00:53:55,989 --> 00:53:56,789
We love you too.

653
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,659
Hi, I'm Dinga Bakaba,

654
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,500
and game director at Arcane Lyon.

655
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:10,940
Is this for Wolfenstein or is this a new game?

656
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,739
In the same studio.

657
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,179
So along with partnering with our good friends

658
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:17,340
at Machine Games on Wolfenstein,

659
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,300
we've been working on other projects at Arcane Lyon.

660
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,219
And tonight we're excited to announce

661
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,380
our latest first-person action game.

662
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,099
It's something innovative,

663
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,940
stylish,

664
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,099
and different from anything we've done before.

665
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:34,139
Innovative, stylish, and different.

666
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:36,300
Let me begin by saying

667
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,579
bienvenue to the frozen island of Black Reef.

668
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:43,099
This is a place of mystery

669
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:46,380
where our looks can kill.

670
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,199
The game takes place during what we say in French

671
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:52,280
is the période de folie,

672
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,280
a time of madness.

673
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,079
And now that we've given you

674
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:59,079
a small taste of the world,

675
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:02,679
let us introduce you to our two deadly rivals,

676
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,280
Colt and Juliana.

677
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,639
Is it just concept art?

678
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,079
It's not, is it just, no, okay.

679
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:07,579
Yeah.

680
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:23,210
This place is in a paradise.

681
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:25,369
It's a prison.

682
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:31,610
Out here.

683
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:32,170
Out here?

684
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:32,889
We're trapped.

685
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:33,389
We're free.

686
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:37,369
In this endless, eternal cycle.

687
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:54,730
Your life's purpose is on this island.

688
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:59,460
I can't let this go on any longer.

689
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:05,079
Days I repeat.

690
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:06,519
The longer that I'm out here.

691
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:07,960
The more certain I am.

692
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:08,699
1v1?

693
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:13,300
To protect the cycle.

694
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,139
The only way to break the cycle

695
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:17,139
is to kill you.

696
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:35,260
It's gonna be like a 1v1 action adventure game?

697
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:36,780
Multiplayer?

698
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:48,619
Is on my side.

699
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:50,780
Deathloop.

700
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,809
All right, let's get some deets on this one.

701
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:55,610
Let's get the details.

702
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,449
I want details on this one.

703
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:13,860
Deathloop combines a mind-bending story

704
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,780
with meticulously designed levels,

705
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,780
and of course, arcane signature gameplay

706
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,260
that lets you approach every situation

707
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:22,980
any way you like.

708
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,619
Because in the endless clash

709
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:28,579
between these two extraordinary assassins,

710
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,340
how you play is up to you.

711
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:34,420
Plus, I think it's really fucking cool.

712
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,989
I mean, yeah.

713
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,510
What is it?

714
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:44,869
Yeah, maybe, maybe you should have said

715
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:46,070
that in French actually.

716
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:47,429
Maybe, maybe not.

717
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:50,389
But, but it's also pretty fucking true.

718
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,429
Are we allowed to swear on in person

719
00:57:55,429 --> 00:57:57,030
but not like on the trailer?

720
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,230
And we really hope that you enjoy it.

721
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,630
They're really emphasizing like the F word here.

722
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:01,829
They're like, oh fuck!

723
00:58:02,469 --> 00:58:05,750
But their trailer has like, I don't understand.

724
00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:09,829
It's a wonderful way to get away

725
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:11,989
from all the pressures in life.

726
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,349
I think the sense of community

727
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:15,590
has really helped me as a person

728
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,429
because I'm typically very isolated.

729
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:19,670
It's definitely very confidence building.

730
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,110
It's brought me out of my shell

731
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,389
and stopped being an introvert.

732
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:24,869
I could like be a hero and do all these things.

733
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:27,110
You find really creative, really fun,

734
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,030
really talented people.

735
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,150
Meet people who are in my group

736
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,070
that I've only known as a character.

737
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,710
Probably made more friends online than I have.

738
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:38,010
The games that you bring out

739
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,929
just helps people honestly.

740
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:42,809
My parents were refugees from the Vietnam War,

741
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:44,329
which is why I'm also fascinated

742
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:45,849
by elements of war.

743
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:48,329
Playing these games just kind of put me out of

744
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,730
the worry and the stress.

745
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:55,130
I was in a dark place for a while

746
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,329
and I told myself I wasn't going

747
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:57,690
to be there anymore.

748
00:58:57,690 --> 00:58:59,369
And so now the only dark places

749
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,210
that I'm allowed to go are in dungeons and ESO.

750
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:04,730
Just being someone who is LGBT,

751
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:07,210
it's nice to be able to sit down

752
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,170
and play these games

753
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,250
and feel accepted for who I am.

754
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,409
It's really nice to see that their storyline

755
00:59:12,409 --> 00:59:14,969
has some sort of emotional effect on me as a player.

756
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,929
And I just really admire the creativity

757
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,050
that goes into the process

758
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,409
of making these big worlds

759
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:21,690
with these amazing stories.

760
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:23,369
Good shit.

761
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:26,889
This is old, John.

762
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:28,250
This is like old milk.

763
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:35,050
Building these fantastic worlds

764
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,809
and telling these stories

765
00:59:36,809 --> 00:59:38,409
comes from a passion to deliver

766
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,809
the very best experiences for our players.

767
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,210
Hi, I'm James Altman,

768
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,809
director of publishing at Bethesda.

769
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,110
What do you got for us?

770
00:59:49,909 --> 00:59:52,619
Robert Duffy.

771
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:53,820
Starlight, whatever it's called.

772
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,699
Starfleet.

773
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:55,579
What's the name of that game?

774
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,670
Stargazer.

775
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,030
What's the one everyone wants to see?

776
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:03,050
Starfield.

777
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,650
We have some exciting new technology

778
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:06,969
to show you that can dramatically

779
01:00:06,969 --> 01:00:08,570
improve gaming for millions.

780
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:11,210
So for the past two decades,

781
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,809
we've approached game development

782
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,449
not by looking at what is possible today

783
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,329
but with a vision of what can be possible tomorrow.

784
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:19,289
And at Bethesda,

785
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:21,849
we're proud of our legacy of innovation

786
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:22,809
where again and again

787
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:24,010
we've changed the industry.

788
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:26,969
We were the first to use physics-based engines

789
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:27,849
for sports games.

790
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,010
We were groundbreakers with

791
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,530
go anywhere, do anything,

792
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:32,809
open world RPGs.

793
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:36,170
We are the inventors of the first person shooter

794
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,570
which is now the world's most popular form of gaming.

795
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:45,590
We are pioneers in downloadable content

796
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,070
and the first to bring mods to consoles.

797
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:50,550
And actually, since we first brought mods

798
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,469
to consoles in 2016,

799
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:54,150
there have been one billion

800
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,070
mod downloads for Fallout and Skyrim.

801
01:00:57,429 --> 01:01:03,980
We of course developed the first

802
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,460
commercially viable VR technology

803
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,860
revealed in our E3 booth in 2012.

804
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:11,179
Yes, that is the original VR headset

805
01:01:11,179 --> 01:01:12,539
held together by tape

806
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:14,380
and worn by our very own Tim Willits.

807
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,619
They're taking a lot of credit.

808
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:21,590
We also invented corn, maze.

809
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,949
And of course, we are well known

810
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:24,309
as developers of best in class.

811
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:25,909
I invented the hamburger too.

812
01:01:33,139 --> 01:01:35,139
Innovation and creativity is in our game.

813
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:37,300
Weirdly enough, we also invented

814
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,179
the dentist drill.

815
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:41,219
To improve player experiences.

816
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:42,500
So tonight, we have exciting

817
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,699
new technology to announce.

818
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,420
We're going to show you the result

819
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,179
of years of research and development.

820
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,739
Cutting edge game engine based technology

821
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:52,820
we've developed specifically for game streaming.

822
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:55,380
Now we'd like to introduce you to Orion.

823
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:57,380
Streaming? Streamers?

824
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,699
I heard streamer.

825
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:00,340
I'm a streamer.

826
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:01,940
I'm not going to like this.

827
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,059
Maybe I'll like this.

828
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:05,380
Orion is a tremendous breakthrough

829
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,139
in streaming technology.

830
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:08,579
It is our name for a group

831
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:10,340
of patented technologies

832
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,260
that optimize game engines

833
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,739
for performance in a cloud environment.

834
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:17,139
Orion can work with any game engine

835
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:18,900
and will improve player experiences

836
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,500
no matter which game you're playing

837
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,619
or whether you're streaming

838
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:23,539
on Stadia, on Xcloud

839
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:24,980
or another streaming platform.

840
01:02:25,539 --> 01:02:27,139
So how does Orion work?

841
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,019
The exciting game streaming services

842
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:31,380
you've been hearing so much about

843
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,380
have largely focused on hardware solutions

844
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:36,179
to address the complex challenges of streaming.

845
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:37,539
That's a lot of words.

846
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,099
We used our expertise

847
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:43,019
in developing game engine software

848
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:44,139
and took a different approach.

849
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,780
By incorporating Orion technology

850
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,059
at the game engine level

851
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:51,099
we're able to stream game content

852
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:53,739
up to 20% faster per frame

853
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:56,699
leading to a dramatic reduction in latency.

854
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:59,579
In addition, an Orion-enabled game

855
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:02,059
can stream with up to 40% lower bandwidth.

856
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,699
And happily for game developers

857
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:06,619
Orion technology is easy to integrate

858
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,380
with your game build with RSDK.

859
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,219
But what does that mean for you?

860
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:12,460
It means that streaming games

861
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,780
will be faster and better with Orion

862
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,099
and Orion substantially reduces

863
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,380
the cost of streaming

864
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:21,340
for players and for publishers.

865
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,619
So it won't matter

866
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:23,980
if your friends and family

867
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,420
are sucking up all the bandwidth

868
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,780
or if you live far away from a data center.

869
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,380
With Orion,

870
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,380
you'll still be able to stream your game

871
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,579
at max settings.

872
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:38,570
But that's real.

873
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:39,849
I mean max settings.

874
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:44,230
It's a big deal if it works.

875
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:49,179
Now as with any new computer technology

876
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:51,579
one must ask the question

877
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:53,260
can it play Doom?

878
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,329
He said the word.

879
01:03:56,329 --> 01:03:58,809
Question, can it stream

880
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:02,250
an unrelenting first person shooter

881
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,250
with native 4K resolution

882
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:05,690
at 60 frames per second?

883
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:06,969
Let's see.

884
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,329
Oh, it's really doing.

885
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:08,969
I want to see this.

886
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:11,050
So I wish I could see doing right now.

887
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:15,820
I can't wait.

888
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,260
I'd like to introduce Shale Williams

889
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,019
tech specialist from id Software.

890
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:20,539
Oh, here it comes guys.

891
01:04:20,539 --> 01:04:21,179
This is it.

892
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:22,059
It's coming right now.

893
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:24,300
So Shale is streaming

894
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,539
an Orion enabled Doom 2016

895
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:28,300
right now to that mobile device.

896
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,739
Holy shit, he's actually doing it.

897
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:31,659
There is no reduction in visual fidelity.

898
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:34,329
This is the greatest thing

899
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,449
I've ever seen in my life.

900
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:36,409
At 60 frames per second

901
01:04:36,409 --> 01:04:37,929
without perceptible latency.

902
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:39,849
And we want you all to

903
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:42,170
experience the power of streaming technology

904
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,809
yourself as we test and refine it.

905
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:46,010
So for a chance to be among

906
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:47,210
the first in the world

907
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,090
to stream Doom 2016 for free

908
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,289
all you need to do is join

909
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:52,730
the Doom Slayers Club

910
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:55,530
by registering at slayersclub.com tonight.

911
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:56,650
Holy shit.

912
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:58,329
Are you kidding me?

913
01:04:58,329 --> 01:04:59,369
This is fucking the greatest thing

914
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:00,329
I've ever seen in my entire life.

915
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,010
What the fuck, dude?

916
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:06,099
I'm okay.

917
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:07,300
Everybody could use a little more

918
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,179
Doom in their lives.

919
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:15,099
We'll see you in hell.

920
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:36,119
What you interfere with now

921
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,719
is bigger than you can imagine.

922
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:47,380
Continue this wrath.

923
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:51,699
It is written.

924
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,530
It is their time to give penance.

925
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:02,440
You are but one man.

926
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:18,070
They are no longer your people to save.

927
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:52,150
Holy shit.

928
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:59,219
I'm gonna need some help.

929
01:07:02,539 --> 01:07:12,840
I'm gonna need help.

930
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:15,059
I can't.

931
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:16,179
I fucking clogged so much.

932
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:16,739
I don't.

933
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:18,260
I shrunk down into my fucking clothes.

934
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:18,980
I can't get out of here.

935
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:19,539
This is awesome.

936
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:20,820
Thank you so, so much.

937
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,619
I'm Marty Stratton,

938
01:07:23,619 --> 01:07:25,860
the executive producer of Doom Eternal.

939
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:31,050
And I'm Hugo Martin,

940
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,489
the game's creative director.

941
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:38,360
As you just saw,

942
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,320
we're not just building a world for Doom.

943
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,320
It's an entire universe.

944
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,199
Earth is on the brink of annihilation.

945
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:48,519
It's being consumed by demons.

946
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:50,599
And your crusade to save it

947
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,159
will take you across dimensions

948
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:56,119
to locations never seen before in Doom,

949
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:58,199
from heaven and hell

950
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,360
to the sentinel home world and beyond.

951
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:01,659
Yeah.

952
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:09,559
There is so much to see and discover.

953
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:13,320
But Doom is first and foremost about gameplay.

954
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,559
And Doom Eternal promises to be

955
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,319
the ultimate power fantasy.

956
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:21,000
The fun comes from mastering the experience

957
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,079
because you are the Doom Slayer,

958
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:26,520
the strongest, fastest demon killer in existence.

959
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,520
And nothing can stand in your way.

960
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,859
Absolutely.

961
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:37,000
Of course, the challenge in Doom

962
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,960
is all about handcrafted combat,

963
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,920
but also engaging level design.

964
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,279
And in Doom Eternal,

965
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,600
the game always has something

966
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,960
new to throw at you,

967
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,720
even deep into the campaign.

968
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,000
Let's take a look.

969
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:53,159
This is gonna be good.

970
01:08:55,239 --> 01:08:56,520
Doom's combat was a ton of fun.

971
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:15,180
The chat's way behind.

972
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,020
There's like a two minute delay on the screen.

973
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,220
That's just for stream snipers.

974
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:44,409
What the fuck was that?

975
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:48,310
Was it a brain?

976
01:09:58,859 --> 01:09:59,659
Thanks.

977
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:03,960
You know, it's so important to us at id Software

978
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,359
that every aspect of the gameplay

979
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:08,359
has real meaning to you, the player.

980
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,439
Every enemy is different.

981
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,199
Every weapon has a purpose

982
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:14,119
and every decision you make really counts.

983
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,479
The only path to victory in Doom Eternal

984
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,039
is to aggressively control the fight

985
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:23,159
with amazing agility, powerful guns,

986
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:24,439
and critical resources.

987
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,479
That's right.

988
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:28,359
I'll tell you, we absolutely can't wait

989
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:29,239
for you to play it.

990
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,039
And some of you won't have to wait too long.

991
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:35,479
If you are lucky enough to be in the room tonight.

992
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:39,180
In the room tonight.

993
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:40,699
Not like Open Dead E3.

994
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:42,380
You'll have a chance to play it

995
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,220
immediately following the show.

996
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:47,960
What the hell?

997
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,000
Why am I not there?

998
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:49,800
I want to be there.

999
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:55,140
And for those not here.

1000
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,100
Look under your seat.

1001
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,100
I got one.

1002
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,659
Playable in the Bethesda booth all week.

1003
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:05,029
But enough talk.

1004
01:11:05,989 --> 01:11:07,829
Let's see how it all comes together.

1005
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:11,909
And watch as this perfect killing machine

1006
01:11:11,909 --> 01:11:12,550
goes to work.

1007
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:19,609
So what are we looking for here?

1008
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:20,569
Guys, guys.

1009
01:11:20,569 --> 01:11:22,010
Hey, what are we looking for?

1010
01:11:31,909 --> 01:11:37,180
Is Doom Eternal the only game

1011
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:40,779
that has shown this much gameplay?

1012
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:42,220
I feel like we haven't seen very much gameplay

1013
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,060
this whole conference.

1014
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:53,989
Or is this game player or is this not?

1015
01:11:54,789 --> 01:12:00,659
There we go.

1016
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:02,649
I mean, it's definitely,

1017
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:03,850
it's going to be scripted gameplay,

1018
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:04,729
but we'll see.

1019
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:13,609
It looks great.

1020
01:12:19,819 --> 01:12:20,779
Missed chest.

1021
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:22,539
Missed chest.

1022
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,779
Guys, I'm not playing the game right now.

1023
01:12:26,739 --> 01:12:27,939
I'm not doing this.

1024
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:41,340
This guy sucks.

1025
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,539
This streamer sucks.

1026
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:53,770
You guys are vicious.

1027
01:12:53,770 --> 01:13:24,390
Looks fun.

1028
01:13:25,029 --> 01:13:25,430
It does.

1029
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:48,489
Turn up your FOV.

1030
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:50,600
No, I don't play with higher FOV.

1031
01:13:50,600 --> 01:14:23,000
Here's me an advantage over other players.

1032
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,359
Yeah, this is a lot of gameplay.

1033
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:29,850
It's pretty foreign in the world of E3.

1034
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:57,590
Louder, louder, louder.

1035
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:04,649
Lava.

1036
01:15:04,649 --> 01:15:07,270
Don't just want to put that lava

1037
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,909
on your ice cream.

1038
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:16,810
Like let it cool down for a little bit

1039
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,090
and then drip it on your ice cream.

1040
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:23,510
I feel like lava is a spicy orange flavor.

1041
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:24,229
Like a spicy,

1042
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:26,470
like clementine flavor.

1043
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:44,880
Thanks.

1044
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:47,289
Thanks.

1045
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:48,890
Thanks, guys.

1046
01:15:49,909 --> 01:15:50,550
That was awesome.

1047
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,229
Did the scream guy get up?

1048
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:55,430
Maybe he got up and started screaming.

1049
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:58,069
Because the gameplay that you just saw

1050
01:15:58,069 --> 01:16:00,069
is just a piece of what you're going

1051
01:16:00,069 --> 01:16:01,750
to play this week at E3.

1052
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:07,800
But I bet a lot of you are wondering

1053
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,800
when do we get to play Doom Eternal

1054
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,439
at our home?

1055
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,420
Well, you don't have to wait too much longer.

1056
01:16:15,619 --> 01:16:16,420
Not quite tomorrow.

1057
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,859
September.

1058
01:16:19,859 --> 01:16:21,300
But Doom Eternal will release

1059
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:21,939
September 4th.

1060
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:23,220
On November 22nd.

1061
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:23,859
That was close.

1062
01:16:29,909 --> 01:16:30,710
It's already been,

1063
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,909
it's been out for two months.

1064
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:34,789
How did you miss it in the Steam store?

1065
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:38,069
An amazing collector's edition.

1066
01:16:38,069 --> 01:16:39,350
We're really proud of.

1067
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,850
Yeah.

1068
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:41,600
Yeah.

1069
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:43,899
That's an actual helmet.

1070
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:46,920
Yeah, you could wear it.

1071
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,880
You could wear that thing.

1072
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,500
He's already got one on.

1073
01:16:57,939 --> 01:16:58,439
Lucky.

1074
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:00,260
This guy's already got it.

1075
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:01,060
That's right.

1076
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:01,859
Already a badass.

1077
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:02,899
He's already got one on.

1078
01:17:04,939 --> 01:17:05,260
All right.

1079
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:07,100
Well, we've got one more thing.

1080
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,020
We know that you've been waiting to hear about.

1081
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,380
He's like, actually, no.

1082
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,699
I'm a fucking astronaut dickhead.

1083
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:15,909
I just got off the moon.

1084
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:19,350
We've been developing this in-house, it did.

1085
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,430
And it's unlike anything you've played before.

1086
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:22,710
Yeah.

1087
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:25,909
We've been so pumped to share this with you.

1088
01:17:25,909 --> 01:17:28,229
This is pure doom, but with your friends.

1089
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:32,470
Where two player-controlled demons take on one

1090
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:35,109
fully-loaded slayer in a fight to the death.

1091
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:35,909
2v1?

1092
01:17:35,909 --> 01:17:38,390
This is a first-person fighter.

1093
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:41,909
Where it's demon strategy versus slayer skill.

1094
01:17:41,909 --> 01:17:43,109
You know, we can't wait.

1095
01:17:43,109 --> 01:17:43,670
2v1?

1096
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,630
Because we know you'll love the different play styles

1097
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,310
of the various demons.

1098
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:52,069
Because each has unique movement, attacks, and abilities.

1099
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,069
They can even spawn AI-

1100
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:54,949
This is reverse evolve.

1101
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:57,829
To control the battlefield and help you take down the slayer.

1102
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:02,470
It's strategic, competitive, and it's a ton of fun.

1103
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:05,270
And we can't wait to share more details with you

1104
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:06,949
this year at QuakeCon.

1105
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:07,590
Oh, it's in already?

1106
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:09,670
There's a lot more to share at QuakeCon.

1107
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:13,350
But before we go, we do want to take a first look

1108
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:15,670
at Doom Eternal's new multiplayer.

1109
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:16,630
Oh, we are going to see it.

1110
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:19,270
On behalf of our amazing team at Id in Dallas

1111
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:21,750
and Frankfurt, Germany, we want to thank you

1112
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,670
all so much for your support.

1113
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,029
Thanks, everyone.

1114
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:33,930
2v1.

1115
01:18:34,819 --> 01:18:36,899
Demons versus one decked out player.

1116
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,340
Fight.

1117
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:52,539
Demon health critical.

1118
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:59,430
Yes, Jerma.

1119
01:18:59,430 --> 01:18:59,930
2v1.

1120
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:01,449
Yes.

1121
01:19:01,989 --> 01:19:04,300
Slayer killed.

1122
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,020
True.

1123
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:08,869
Oh, is this-

1124
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:10,710
Is this 2v1?

1125
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:11,909
2v1, I guess.

1126
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:33,819
Fight.

1127
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:38,619
No, I mean, it's-

1128
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,140
It looks alright.

1129
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:44,149
It's kind of just-

1130
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,960
It'll be fun, by the way.

1131
01:19:55,109 --> 01:19:56,949
And now introducing Goldust.

1132
01:19:57,829 --> 01:20:05,430
And for everyone at our studios around the globe

1133
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,109
that have worked so hard in the great games

1134
01:20:07,109 --> 01:20:08,710
you've seen tonight, we say thank you.

1135
01:20:09,819 --> 01:20:13,180
2019 marks 25 years of Doom.

1136
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,420
So, to celebrate, we will be going all out

1137
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:17,180
with Doom at QuakeCon this summer.

1138
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,420
No, I'll just go with 6 and no Starfield.

1139
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,100
Panels and activities dedicated to Doom,

1140
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,859
which we call DoomCon.

1141
01:20:23,739 --> 01:20:25,850
DoomCon.

1142
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:26,569
See what we did there?

1143
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:28,010
We took out the Quake and put Doom.

1144
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:31,939
We hope you can come hang out with us in Dallas

1145
01:20:31,939 --> 01:20:33,619
at our inaugural event in London.

1146
01:20:33,619 --> 01:20:35,699
If you can't, please tune in online.

1147
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:38,659
Until then, go to Bethesda.net for more info

1148
01:20:38,659 --> 01:20:40,500
on all the games you saw tonight.

1149
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,779
If you're here at E3 this week,

1150
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:43,859
we'll have hands-on with many of our games,

1151
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:45,779
so be sure to stop by our booth.

1152
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:47,699
In the meantime, thanks for playing,

1153
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:48,819
thanks for watching,

1154
01:20:48,819 --> 01:20:50,819
and thanks to all of you for being part of the-

1155
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:53,859
No, they'll do like an Elder Scrolls 6 teaser, right?

1156
01:20:53,859 --> 01:20:54,659
I mean, they did one last-

1157
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:56,420
They did one last year, of course they are.

1158
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:58,340
They did one last year.

1159
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:05,579
They teased it last year and it's not ready to show at all.

1160
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:08,140
At Bethesda, we're in the business of creating heroes.

1161
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:11,500
But the true hero is you.

1162
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:15,140
They already confirmed no-

1163
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,220
It's like we hand you this malleable clay

1164
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,979
and you do these extraordinary things

1165
01:21:18,979 --> 01:21:20,180
that we never could have imagined.

1166
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:25,189
We get to build these worlds and these communities,

1167
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:26,710
and you all come in and you play

1168
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,789
and you bring these worlds that we create to life.

1169
01:21:28,789 --> 01:21:29,670
Need more PR.

1170
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:31,750
You help us build richer worlds.

1171
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,350
You add meaning to everything we do.

1172
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,350
We are glad you're here.

1173
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:40,470
We're so glad you're here.

1174
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:41,109
To the heroes.

1175
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,869
To the heroes.

1176
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:45,270
Shit, I don't have a drink.

1177
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,909
To you.

1178
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:46,409
To you.

1179
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:03,619
Well, there it is.

1180
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:07,770
Bethesda Conference. Done.

1181
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:12,649
Got a lot of mobile games.

1182
01:22:13,369 --> 01:22:14,010
Got a lot of-

1183
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:17,319
We got to see a lot of Doom Eternal, though.

1184
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,760
You got to see a lot of Doom.

1185
01:22:19,899 --> 01:22:20,539
Got to see it.

1186
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:22,699
2v1.

1187
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,829
Looks like it's 2v1 in that mode.

1188
01:22:25,829 --> 01:22:26,630
I'm not sure it could be.

1189
01:22:28,939 --> 01:22:29,819
And that's it.

1190
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:31,239
That's it.

1191
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:40,279
That was me singing, by the way.

1192
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:40,779
It was?

1193
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:43,239
Am I going to pretend to be a streamer?

1194
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:44,359
All right.

1195
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,079
Well, that's what Bethesda had to offer there at E3.

1196
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:50,890
They mentioned Fallout 76.

1197
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:52,489
Hell, they gave it an expansion.

1198
01:22:53,689 --> 01:22:55,130
And then they announced-

1199
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:57,130
Did they close my stream?

1200
01:22:57,609 --> 01:22:58,890
Did they turn me off?

1201
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,210
You guys just saw the Bethesda Conference.

1202
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,970
We don't want you doing this shit!

1203
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:04,170
So prepare thyselves.

1204
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:08,090
Co-walk us through the Fallout 76 stuff.

1205
01:23:09,529 --> 01:23:12,170
If I could play back the VOD and just highlight your face

1206
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:13,689
the entire time, it would maybe tell the story-

1207
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:14,970
Highlight my face.

1208
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:16,329
Let's hear you put it into words.

1209
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:22,489
I already pretended I was on the panel like three times.

1210
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:23,689
You want me to do this joke again?

1211
01:23:23,689 --> 01:23:24,329
It was a funny joke.

1212
01:23:25,449 --> 01:23:27,689
That was the punchline.

1213
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:34,279
Actually, and it turns out at some point

1214
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:36,039
we slipped into the worst timeline.

1215
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:37,880
I don't know exactly when that happened,

1216
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,680
but we just kind of slipped streamed on in there.

1217
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,039
It was pretty impressive.

1218
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:50,279
As far as I know, there's still some major, major bugs

1219
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:53,560
with Fallout 76 and that whole thing about-

1220
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,079
which is one of the reasons when Tom was like,

1221
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:57,640
yeah, we have such a great community.

1222
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:00,920
That's because your PVP mechanics are broken.

1223
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,199
That's why they aren't killing each other.

1224
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:06,359
It's because that system is fundamentally flawed

1225
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:08,439
and people don't use it.

1226
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:10,359
You want to, but you can't.

1227
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,939
Yeah, so it's a little interesting.

1228
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:18,779
I don't know.

1229
01:24:18,779 --> 01:24:19,739
Here's the thing.

1230
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:22,699
I knew there was going to be blade stuff.

1231
01:24:22,699 --> 01:24:26,460
I knew there was going to be ESO 26.

1232
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,659
This is the kind of thing I had to do.

1233
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:27,739
Sorry.

1234
01:24:27,739 --> 01:24:30,060
These are all things that are going to happen.

1235
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:30,560
Right.

1236
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,739
But I will say the Commander Keen stuff.

1237
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:37,020
That was-

1238
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:37,520
Yeah.

1239
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:42,060
That kind of hit me on a spiritual level.

1240
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:47,579
I grew up with Commander Keen and it was the kind of thing where-

1241
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,380
I'm just going to go ahead and pretty much make the same joke.

1242
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,140
It's the kind of thing where-

1243
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:54,859
I do that every day.

1244
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,500
I had to watch Command and Conquer, go mobile,

1245
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:04,539
and then die this public execution-style death

1246
01:25:04,539 --> 01:25:06,300
where everyone just gave up on it.

1247
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,539
And now we have to do that with Commander Keen.

1248
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:13,819
And it's just like, oh man.

1249
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:14,300
It sucks.

1250
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,220
It's unfortunate.

1251
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:21,819
It's like us old people have to watch our favorite franchises become our worst enemy.

1252
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:23,899
Mortal Kombat says hello.

1253
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,300
It's just unfortunate.

1254
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:29,579
Should we just go into the conference talk at this point?

1255
01:25:33,579 --> 01:25:38,939
Zeke, me and you are out on Fallout 76.

1256
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:41,420
We played it for a day and then we're good there.

1257
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,180
Nobody who played it.

1258
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,300
Spent some time with the game.

1259
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:46,140
And you also are-

1260
01:25:47,819 --> 01:25:48,460
Follow me.

1261
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:48,960
Follow me.

1262
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:50,859
I'm sorry.

1263
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:54,539
Is the BR at all interesting?

1264
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:55,899
Is that-

1265
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:56,399
No.

1266
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,260
What's your guys' favorite fast food?

1267
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,899
Movement in everything of the Fallout games has never been my draw to it.

1268
01:26:01,899 --> 01:26:04,859
So why would I want a game that relies on movement and shooting

1269
01:26:05,979 --> 01:26:08,939
when those are the things that are not good about the game?

1270
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:11,260
That's Fallout 76.

1271
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,739
Wendy's is probably the best, I think.

1272
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:17,020
They're also still having pretty major server stability issues.

1273
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,579
Yeah.

1274
01:26:17,579 --> 01:26:18,619
Another thing they are, you're right.

1275
01:26:18,619 --> 01:26:21,979
Small groups of players on spread out servers

1276
01:26:21,979 --> 01:26:24,779
and they're wanting to do 52 player games now?

1277
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,340
Somebody in my chat just said it's fucking hilarious.

1278
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,060
It's just the game isn't-

1279
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,739
Somebody in my chat just said-

1280
01:26:29,739 --> 01:26:30,619
Hold on, hold on.

1281
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:31,180
Listen.

1282
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,859
The story in my chat just said that Burger King was the best.

1283
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:37,500
No, I'm sorry.

1284
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:37,899
I'm sorry.

1285
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:38,699
I don't mean to interrupt you.

1286
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:39,979
It's in a different dimension.

1287
01:26:39,979 --> 01:26:40,939
The Burger King really-

1288
01:26:40,939 --> 01:26:41,500
I don't know, man.

1289
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,899
The death is what happened and then the-

1290
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:45,340
That's unbelievable.

1291
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:45,819
I can't even-

1292
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:49,579
Slowly rolling down the hill without any-

1293
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:50,060
I'm sorry.

1294
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:50,619
I'm sorry.

1295
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:51,899
I really don't mean to fuck this whole thing up.

1296
01:26:52,939 --> 01:26:54,460
My favorite thing, I think-

1297
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:57,979
...about the Fallout 76 portion is the crowd member that when they said

1298
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:00,699
that the server capacity was being raised just lost his shit.

1299
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:03,659
He just really was all about the server capacity.

1300
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:06,140
What was going on with the fucking crowd?

1301
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,020
The whole conference-

1302
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:07,899
That guy's screaming!

1303
01:27:07,899 --> 01:27:09,659
...up until PSO was done-

1304
01:27:09,659 --> 01:27:10,939
That guy's fucking screaming!

1305
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:12,699
...was really into that shit.

1306
01:27:12,699 --> 01:27:12,939
Right?

1307
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:13,979
Maybe a little bit too much.

1308
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:16,699
You get it.

1309
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:18,220
There was employees up front.

1310
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,819
Do we have a direct source that was saying it?

1311
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:22,619
Well, they were all wearing Bethesda shirts so I think that was the-

1312
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:28,619
I went to a conference like two years ago and they had our seats in the very front.

1313
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:32,300
So I'm assuming that that was what they did before.

1314
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:32,859
Right.

1315
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:34,060
But I'm not positive.

1316
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,020
There are still-

1317
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,460
I gotta go?

1318
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,819
Thanks for inviting me.

1319
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:38,779
Even 76 has-

1320
01:27:38,779 --> 01:27:39,579
I gotta get out of here.

1321
01:27:39,579 --> 01:27:41,979
They weren't kidding when they said that 76 has an active player base.

1322
01:27:41,979 --> 01:27:43,899
I know people that are still-

1323
01:27:43,899 --> 01:27:47,260
They put all the stuff to the side and they're still enjoying those games.

1324
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:49,020
And ESO is bigger than it's ever been.

1325
01:27:49,659 --> 01:27:51,979
So, I mean, there's, you know, there's, there's-

1326
01:27:51,979 --> 01:27:56,300
If you can drink the Kool-Aid, if you like that kind of stuff, then, you know-

1327
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:56,859
Kool-Aid's not-

1328
01:27:56,859 --> 01:27:57,340
They're there.

1329
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,140
They're around.

1330
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:58,380
Yeah.

1331
01:27:59,979 --> 01:28:00,699
I'm sorry, guys.

1332
01:28:00,699 --> 01:28:01,260
I gotta go.

1333
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:02,060
I have to get out of here.

1334
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,699
I'm supposed to be for like two hours but-

1335
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:09,659
I gotta go to Burger King because people think it's a joke that I like it.

1336
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,180
Like, how much do you love Fallout 76?

1337
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,939
Or, excuse me, how much do you love Bethesda?

1338
01:28:13,899 --> 01:28:17,500
And they gave out t-shirts and said, we'll give you a front row ticket.

1339
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,300
Should I just go?

1340
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,060
Make sure to be really enthusiastic.

1341
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:20,300
Sure.

1342
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:21,420
Yeah.

1343
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:22,939
I thought, my name's Jerma985.

1344
01:28:22,939 --> 01:28:23,899
Please.

1345
01:28:23,899 --> 01:28:27,020
You'd think they would know, like, maybe tone it down after a little bit.

1346
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,260
Well, we got, we gotta be careful.

1347
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,340
Let's not yuck their yum, you know?

1348
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:33,659
Yeah, celebrate it.

1349
01:28:33,659 --> 01:28:34,859
They're enjoying it and having their fun.

1350
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:35,659
If I could get a shout out-

1351
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:37,340
We'll have our negative opinions and they can keep having fun.

1352
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:38,619
Jerma985 is my name.

1353
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:39,340
Exactly.

1354
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:39,819
Exactly.

1355
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,859
The other favorite thing, I think Zeke caught this.

1356
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,739
I don't know if Anne or Co did, but Zeke lost a shit when they said it.

1357
01:28:45,739 --> 01:28:50,699
In the Wastelanders trailer that they showed, the voice-acted line was,

1358
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:52,699
we didn't expect anyone to come back.

1359
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,300
That was-

1360
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:54,779
I'll see what-

1361
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,140
That's pretty on the nose.

1362
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,180
You'll just get somebody else.

1363
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:02,220
That was so, so delicious to hear that.

1364
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,859
Just like, we didn't expect anyone to come back.

1365
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:06,300
I was like, really?

1366
01:29:08,539 --> 01:29:08,859
Yeah.

1367
01:29:09,979 --> 01:29:14,060
The next line was, I can't believe you idiots are still giving us your money.

1368
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:17,340
But we were all laughing, so we went over.

1369
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:18,140
Exactly. That's right.

1370
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:22,939
Co, the other stuff, and you brought this up as we were watching it.

1371
01:29:22,939 --> 01:29:25,659
The human NPCs, full quest line, and dialogue trees.

1372
01:29:25,659 --> 01:29:28,060
Didn't they say that stuff was never going to be in Fallout 76?

1373
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:32,220
They specifically marketed the product to not include that.

1374
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,779
It's just kind of hilarious because when the beta came out,

1375
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:36,859
everyone and their mother was like,

1376
01:29:36,859 --> 01:29:39,100
this game could totally have NPCs.

1377
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:40,539
You should put NPCs in here.

1378
01:29:40,539 --> 01:29:42,060
And they were like, no, no, no.

1379
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,180
That's our decision.

1380
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,420
We are here deciding not to do this.

1381
01:29:45,899 --> 01:29:46,859
This is going to be awesome.

1382
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:48,300
And then a year later, they're like,

1383
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,979
okay, guys, we're putting the NPCs in.

1384
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:50,619
Okay.

1385
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:52,300
They're going to have quest lines and dialogue trees.

1386
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,220
We're putting them back.

1387
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:54,539
It's cool.

1388
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:55,420
It's cool.

1389
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,100
It's just kind of funny because it's like, dude,

1390
01:29:57,819 --> 01:30:00,939
that's what they were screaming at you from before the game was out.

1391
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,260
Now, maybe if they start listening to all that stuff,

1392
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:07,020
hey, maybe Fallout 76 can get good.

1393
01:30:07,659 --> 01:30:09,180
Maybe it's a step in the right direction.

1394
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:12,779
Nothing's not saveable, given enough work and time.

1395
01:30:13,899 --> 01:30:14,619
Yeah, we'll see.

1396
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:15,020
We'll see.

1397
01:30:15,739 --> 01:30:16,859
We will indeed see.

1398
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,579
Right after that, I think the show's starting to

1399
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:23,340
get some life into it, I would say,

1400
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,300
with Ghostwire Tokyo, which is from The Evil Within Devs.

1401
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:28,939
This thing looks pretty good.

1402
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:32,300
It's an action adventure game.

1403
01:30:34,539 --> 01:30:35,979
We didn't see any gameplay at all,

1404
01:30:35,979 --> 01:30:37,180
but the trailer was sick.

1405
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,300
That was a really good trailer or teaser

1406
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,340
or whatever the fuck you want to call it.

1407
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:45,180
But also, you know, we'll see the gameplay,

1408
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:46,140
but yeah.

1409
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,779
Think about Evil Within.

1410
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:49,819
These are the same devs.

1411
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:54,539
They did a great job of translating their CGI stuff,

1412
01:30:54,539 --> 01:30:56,220
which they initially just showed,

1413
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:59,579
into an actual pretty well-made game.

1414
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,020
I had a great time with Evil Within.

1415
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:01,420
Yeah.

1416
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,260
And not only that, but it looks like,

1417
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,180
and yeah, I've known at every point of my life.

1418
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,220
I like Evil Within one day.

1419
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:06,779
I didn't.

1420
01:31:06,779 --> 01:31:07,340
I really didn't.

1421
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:11,979
But with this new thing, apparently something I didn't pick up on

1422
01:31:11,979 --> 01:31:14,779
is the guy that introduced the woman

1423
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:18,140
introduced she is like his protege.

1424
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:18,380
Yeah.

1425
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,380
So it's kind of like we just we just kind of

1426
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:24,619
this passing of the torch, which is kind of awesome.

1427
01:31:24,619 --> 01:31:26,300
And she was great, by the way.

1428
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:26,859
Oh my gosh.

1429
01:31:26,859 --> 01:31:27,659
She was adorable.

1430
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:28,460
She was great.

1431
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:29,340
That was awesome.

1432
01:31:31,979 --> 01:31:32,859
I think this is a sequel.

1433
01:31:32,859 --> 01:31:34,060
The aesthetic was awesome.

1434
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,340
A lot of stylized elements.

1435
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,939
A lot of really interesting imagery.

1436
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:41,180
If the gameplay is good, this could be this could be big.

1437
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,100
Yeah, I thought about Zeke thought.

1438
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:47,579
Yeah, well, I like like it's just a scene like that.

1439
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:48,220
Like, look at that.

1440
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:51,420
There's I thought those are going to turn into worms, by the way.

1441
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:51,739
Sorry.

1442
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:52,220
Interrupt.

1443
01:31:57,579 --> 01:31:58,859
Yeah, yeah.

1444
01:32:01,659 --> 01:32:03,180
Hey, no, hey, no, what are you doing?

1445
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:06,220
No, I want to be part of it, too.

1446
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:10,460
The look of it in the intrigue, the like, you know,

1447
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:14,619
not knowing what's going on, but how cool it like it's compelling.

1448
01:32:14,619 --> 01:32:17,340
And I really make intrigue to see how this.

1449
01:33:05,899 --> 01:33:10,260
By the way, let me just say all those people there,

1450
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,539
they're really fun, nice people.

1451
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:17,899
Just don't ban me from Twitch.

1452
01:33:17,899 --> 01:33:18,619
I didn't do anything.

1453
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:22,119
Devolver is happening right now.

1454
01:33:23,989 --> 01:33:25,189
I mean, you can hear me.

1455
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:25,829
You can hear me or not?

1456
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:30,789
No, no, no, no, no, no Devolver.

1457
01:33:30,789 --> 01:33:33,590
I want to watch Devolver like downstairs with like a bowl of spaghetti.

1458
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:41,109
I just want to eat a bowl of spaghetti downstairs and watch.

1459
01:33:41,109 --> 01:33:43,510
Devolver is only like an hour or like 45 minutes, right?

1460
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:44,390
Less than 45 minutes.

1461
01:33:44,949 --> 01:33:46,819
I'm way too loud.

1462
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:47,300
No, I'm not.

1463
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:47,699
I'm fine.

1464
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:52,630
I'm not going to eat a bowl.

1465
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:53,350
No, I'm not going to.

1466
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,909
I'll see you tomorrow.

1467
01:33:53,909 --> 01:33:58,680
I'll see you tomorrow for what's the first.

1468
01:33:58,680 --> 01:33:59,560
What's tomorrow?

1469
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:00,600
Let's take a look.

1470
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:15,000
Tomorrow is Ubisoft Square.

1471
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,340
We'll catch those months.

1472
01:34:18,899 --> 01:34:24,739
Go make duck broth.

1473
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,859
We're going to play Cooking Sim tomorrow

1474
01:34:27,859 --> 01:34:30,899
because I have to kill like an hour or two again in the middle.

1475
01:34:30,899 --> 01:34:35,689
When is the PC gaming show as well?

1476
01:34:35,689 --> 01:34:37,210
That's at like 10 o'clock in the morning, isn't it?

1477
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:42,489
If I...

1478
01:34:42,489 --> 01:34:44,649
Okay, is that 10 a.m. Eastern?

1479
01:34:53,539 --> 01:34:54,739
10, 9, 8...

1480
01:34:54,739 --> 01:34:56,260
I got to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning?

1481
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:02,920
Please don't leave me.

1482
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:08,789
You might see me for the PC one too.

1483
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,560
Don't go.

1484
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,439
Don't go.

1485
01:35:20,439 --> 01:35:20,920
Skip it.

1486
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:23,000
Yeah, we'll see.

1487
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,420
I got to get some food to me.

1488
01:35:28,859 --> 01:35:30,380
I will see you guys tomorrow.

1489
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:35,609
That's the end.

1490
01:35:35,609 --> 01:35:41,020
It's been six and a half hours.

1491
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:41,500
Holy shit.

1492
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:53,430
Watch Devolver all the across.

1493
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:57,529
Oh, let me mute this before everyone hates me.

1494
01:35:58,329 --> 01:36:10,569
Yeah, I'll be live for at least Ubisoft and Square.

1495
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:11,529
We'll play something in the middle.

1496
01:36:12,329 --> 01:36:14,170
If I get up early enough, maybe the PC conference.

1497
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:16,890
But I don't think I'm going to get up at like 7 o'clock in the morning.

1498
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:19,699
Was there on my mic?

1499
01:36:19,699 --> 01:36:20,579
Is my mic fucked up?

1500
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:26,869
But interesting stuff.

1501
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:29,750
I'm really looking forward to Phantasy Star Online 2.

1502
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:32,140
That looks pretty great.

1503
01:36:33,539 --> 01:36:34,819
That's because I'm peeking.

1504
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:36,569
Something's not right.

1505
01:36:40,539 --> 01:36:41,579
Devolver doesn't need content.

1506
01:36:41,579 --> 01:36:42,380
But that's what I mean.

1507
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:46,300
Devolver is like its own complete edited video package.

1508
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,500
And me just kind of in the corner.

1509
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,260
I don't think I don't really want to do that.

1510
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:53,239
For the other ones, it's like live and people are talking.

1511
01:36:54,039 --> 01:36:56,920
Devolver usually does like a full just edited video, right?

1512
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,369
I don't know if I want to just sit there and...

1513
01:37:00,329 --> 01:37:01,850
I can't really add anything to that, I don't think.

1514
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:09,109
I felt the same way about Nintendo too.

1515
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:10,649
We'll see.

1516
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:13,130
But we're going to do the bits real quick.

1517
01:37:13,689 --> 01:37:14,649
Thanks everybody for watching.

1518
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:15,770
I hope you had a fun time.

1519
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:17,210
I hope you got to see some things you liked.

1520
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:22,699
I'll see you tomorrow for more of the conferences.

1521
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,500
If you catch it, you catch it.

1522
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:30,550
If not, then maybe we'll see you again soon.

1523
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:31,909
Thanks a lot everybody.

1524
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:38,060
See you tomorrow.

1525
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,260
And for those of you that are sticking around,

1526
01:37:39,819 --> 01:37:42,460
for a few minutes while we go over the bits and the subs,

1527
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,329
we had 250 from Deja.

1528
01:37:49,829 --> 01:37:51,670
Thank you Deja for the 250.

1529
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:55,510
Lego Forza sounds like a PS2 cheat code and not a $10 expansion.

1530
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:05,180
People are probably going to love it though.

1531
01:38:05,819 --> 01:38:08,619
Tingy, thanks for the 250.

1532
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:10,859
Lego for next Germa Rumble.

1533
01:38:11,579 --> 01:38:18,140
Like just a physical Lego?

1534
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:24,630
I don't think I can even make that.

1535
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,199
Thank you Turbo Pasta for the $3.

1536
01:38:30,199 --> 01:38:31,880
Master of Comedy has competition.

1537
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:33,399
Thanks for the last.

1538
01:38:34,279 --> 01:38:35,800
And they link a Twitter.

1539
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,810
Somebody made a Germa the Giant Twitter.

1540
01:38:39,369 --> 01:38:41,060
You guys are fast.

1541
01:38:41,779 --> 01:38:49,210
That's not an officially endorsed Twitter account by the way.

1542
01:38:54,939 --> 01:38:57,449
Thank you though.

1543
01:38:57,449 --> 01:38:59,369
Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the $3.

1544
01:38:59,369 --> 01:39:00,409
It didn't mean much to you,

1545
01:39:00,409 --> 01:39:02,890
but the Lego Speed Champions left me hyped.

1546
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:06,170
The map had an Easter egg to this failed Lego theme.

1547
01:39:07,579 --> 01:39:10,460
Plus the Lego Star Wars announcement left me sobbing with joy.

1548
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:13,100
Anyways, for the everything is Lego joke,

1549
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:16,140
I have to agree as we got Lego Stranger Things

1550
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,619
and Lego Minions announced within a month of each other.

1551
01:39:19,859 --> 01:39:20,979
It just does really well.

1552
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:26,039
The Lego is just completely timeless forever.

1553
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:34,579
A timeless, timeless classic thing that will never go away.

1554
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:42,949
It's as old as dirt, but thank you.

1555
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,079
Thank you also to Mini Clips for the $10.

1556
01:39:48,279 --> 01:39:51,239
I heard Todd Howard adopted two kids and named one Todd

1557
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:52,840
and the other Howard.

1558
01:39:55,319 --> 01:39:56,279
I'm not sure that's real,

1559
01:39:56,279 --> 01:39:57,800
but thank you for the $10.

1560
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:58,359
Appreciate it.

1561
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,399
Hey Zalaski, thanks for the 250.

1562
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:08,439
ISE3 2019, where we celebrate 24 years of gamers pretending

1563
01:40:09,399 --> 01:40:11,800
at a trade show for investors and retailers,

1564
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:13,720
a convention for them and flipping out

1565
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:15,560
when it doesn't live up to their expectations.

1566
01:40:16,199 --> 01:40:25,289
Kind of increase those stock prices.

1567
01:40:25,289 --> 01:40:25,689
Thank you.

1568
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:27,369
I'll store H2O for the $5.

1569
01:40:27,369 --> 01:40:29,449
The Microsoft conference felt like they were a bigger pitch

1570
01:40:29,449 --> 01:40:32,970
to PC gaming, like they're keeping their options open

1571
01:40:34,149 --> 01:40:38,149
for an exit from the console market.

1572
01:40:38,149 --> 01:40:40,470
Do you think that the big hardware makers

1573
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:43,109
focusing on high specs in exchange for price accessibility

1574
01:40:43,109 --> 01:40:45,189
is the better option for the next generation of gaming?

1575
01:40:45,989 --> 01:40:48,710
All-in-one entertainment consoles like the Xbox One

1576
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:50,310
seem to have failed.

1577
01:40:51,029 --> 01:40:53,510
But I worry that in going in other directions

1578
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:55,909
might make any console that's not the switch inaccessible.

1579
01:41:00,729 --> 01:41:03,529
I think a lot of the hardware makers

1580
01:41:04,329 --> 01:41:06,329
are almost really, really desperate to have

1581
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:12,119
CD lists and subscription-based content

1582
01:41:13,159 --> 01:41:14,279
that's starting to really...

1583
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:17,239
They can cut back on so many costs.

1584
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:18,680
All these people...

1585
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:22,729
They don't have to make product anymore,

1586
01:41:22,729 --> 01:41:24,890
like actual on-the-shelf product anymore,

1587
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:26,010
if that ever gets to a point.

1588
01:41:26,649 --> 01:41:34,069
Think about how much Xbox desperately would save

1589
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,979
and all these other publishers will save

1590
01:41:36,979 --> 01:41:39,699
if there's no more physical boxes anymore.

1591
01:41:39,699 --> 01:41:41,220
And that's not really a good thing

1592
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:43,539
because we've seen so many times,

1593
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:46,220
oh, yeah, it's just a stream.

1594
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:46,939
It's a service.

1595
01:41:46,939 --> 01:41:48,539
It's, you know, download the game.

1596
01:41:48,539 --> 01:41:49,180
You don't own it.

1597
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:50,380
We do, but it's our server.

1598
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:51,739
But you get the little key to it.

1599
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,640
That could be bad.

1600
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:58,310
But that's the direction a lot of them want to go, I think,

1601
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:01,140
because they can save so much money

1602
01:42:02,439 --> 01:42:03,880
on manufacturing costs.

1603
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:10,100
Somebody mentioned the death of music and CDs.

1604
01:42:10,979 --> 01:42:11,699
Look at Spotify.

1605
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:14,260
Spotify is what you do for music.

1606
01:42:16,659 --> 01:42:18,340
90% of the people in this chat right now

1607
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,100
probably just have Spotify.

1608
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,180
And maybe you still have CDs,

1609
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:25,239
but subscription models or what?

1610
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,239
It's kind of the future, I guess.

1611
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,640
Interesting to see what happens.

1612
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,720
There are pros and cons for both of them.

1613
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:40,329
But thank you.

1614
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:42,489
Hey, Zellgrote, thanks for the $5.

1615
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:44,970
I was watching your Super Fight stream

1616
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:46,170
and would love to see you in Star

1617
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:47,130
and it's Alex played again.

1618
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:49,930
By the way, Todd is in your cupboard.

1619
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,979
He got to Las Vegas real quick.

1620
01:42:54,699 --> 01:42:56,699
He must have taken like a bullet train.

1621
01:43:02,329 --> 01:43:05,000
But that's the game where you

1622
01:43:07,029 --> 01:43:08,710
you have to argue your way

1623
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:11,779
over somebody else with like a monster

1624
01:43:11,779 --> 01:43:12,899
or a power or something, right?

1625
01:43:13,539 --> 01:43:18,100
They probably updated it a lot.

1626
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:18,819
Might be worth doing.

1627
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:21,210
But thank you.

1628
01:43:21,210 --> 01:43:23,529
Thank you, FlyingPixels, $30 earlier.

1629
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:25,289
30 bucks from FlyingPixels.

1630
01:43:25,289 --> 01:43:27,130
You made me laugh so hard that I cried.

1631
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:28,649
That hasn't happened in a while.

1632
01:43:28,649 --> 01:43:29,449
Thanks for the laughs.

1633
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:31,449
Thanks for the 30 fucking dollars

1634
01:43:32,329 --> 01:43:33,449
and for hanging out

1635
01:43:33,449 --> 01:43:38,569
and choosing my stream to take E3 in with.

1636
01:43:38,569 --> 01:43:39,210
So thank you.

1637
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:41,539
Really appreciate it.

1638
01:43:44,359 --> 01:43:46,279
Freudian Weapon, thanks for 250.

1639
01:43:46,279 --> 01:43:47,479
No message, just 250.

1640
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,000
Thank you.

1641
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,720
Jerma lied and didn't draw sticks.

1642
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,840
Thanks for the 250.

1643
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:53,720
You're a dragon.

1644
01:43:55,529 --> 01:43:58,180
You said scalies were not people.

1645
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,060
You aren't a person.

1646
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:01,130
What?

1647
01:44:01,130 --> 01:44:03,050
No, I said I said a dragon.

1648
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:04,890
I said a dragon is not a human.

1649
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:06,939
Because they're not.

1650
01:44:06,939 --> 01:44:07,739
They're a lizard.

1651
01:44:07,739 --> 01:44:08,939
A layer like a lizard.

1652
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:10,859
A dragon is not a person.

1653
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:16,140
They're a they're a dragon.

1654
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:20,789
How is that incorrect?

1655
01:44:24,659 --> 01:44:27,060
Spliceable Spleen gave five community subs earlier.

1656
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:27,939
Thanks for the five subs.

1657
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,020
Dropped him about 10 minutes ago.

1658
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:30,420
Thank you.

1659
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:37,350
Thank you so much for the five community subs.

1660
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:40,420
And then finally here we had let's get the

1661
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:42,739
let's get the credits on here while we have a second.

1662
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:47,270
Join us tomorrow where we do it all again.

1663
01:44:47,909 --> 01:44:49,989
We check out some of the other conferences.

1664
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:54,069
Enjoy the rest of tonight's E3.

1665
01:44:54,069 --> 01:44:57,699
There's Devolver going on like in 20-30 minutes.

1666
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,520
And then probably some after show stuff if you, you know,

1667
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:01,239
go check it out.

1668
01:45:01,239 --> 01:45:02,680
There's a lot of great streamers doing this.

1669
01:45:03,319 --> 01:45:05,020
There's a lot of good content.

1670
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:07,020
A lot of good live stuff going on I think after too.

1671
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:08,380
So check it out.

1672
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:13,859
Let's roll the credits right now.

1673
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:18,869
Here they come.

1674
01:45:18,869 --> 01:45:19,829
Oh my god.

1675
01:45:20,970 --> 01:45:22,250
With this many subs?

1676
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:25,659
Holy shit.

1677
01:45:29,899 --> 01:45:31,180
That's a lot of fucking people.

1678
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:32,619
I didn't know that this many people sub tonight.

1679
01:45:33,579 --> 01:45:33,819
Wow.

1680
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:36,069
That's a lot.

1681
01:45:36,869 --> 01:45:39,829
Thank you to everybody that continues to subscribe to this stream.

1682
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:45,960
You had close to 8k viewers so yeah.

1683
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,279
And that's I thanks for watching that.

1684
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,180
Hopefully you thought it was fun.

1685
01:45:52,899 --> 01:46:00,600
Feed your guild members will do right when I before I close it out.

1686
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,920
But thank you to PeacefulHaley for the 250.

1687
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:05,850
Thank you PeacefulHaley.

1688
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:06,970
Hey Jeremy, how are you?

1689
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:07,930
I'm doing pretty damn good.

1690
01:46:08,409 --> 01:46:12,170
I haven't been here in a while but this year's Bethesda conference is probably the worst.

1691
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:13,369
Just completely dull.

1692
01:46:13,369 --> 01:46:16,810
But at the same time I don't like shitting on the people who make these games.

1693
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:21,369
Because they work hard and are excited about it and I hate seeing people shit on them.

1694
01:46:21,369 --> 01:46:24,250
Even though I can agree yeah this is pretty boring and meh.

1695
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:25,930
Hope Nintendo will save the day.

1696
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:26,970
Anyways enjoy your night.

1697
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:34,310
Yeah I mean it's look there are some great things that were shown today.

1698
01:46:34,869 --> 01:46:37,930
We fell for the bot again.

1699
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:38,409
What bot?

1700
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:42,090
What did I do?

1701
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:45,189
Jeremy has read more bot messages?

1702
01:46:46,069 --> 01:46:50,069
What bot?

1703
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:55,430
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

1704
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:56,869
My chat just crashed.

1705
01:46:56,869 --> 01:46:57,909
What the hell is going on?

1706
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:01,369
My browser just crashed.

1707
01:47:07,819 --> 01:47:12,779
Oh anyways um I mean there's a lot of things that aren't for me.

1708
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:16,060
But there's a few things that I would say that looks pretty great.

1709
01:47:16,939 --> 01:47:18,939
The problem with game conferences like this.

1710
01:47:22,699 --> 01:47:27,819
A lot of it is just let's all like pretend in a room for an hour.

1711
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:29,670
You know what I mean?

1712
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:32,149
Hey let's just like get a bunch of people together and let's like just

1713
01:47:32,869 --> 01:47:38,229
game some excitement for stuff that may not be as exciting as it looks.

1714
01:47:38,949 --> 01:47:42,739
But that's just the nature of the business.

1715
01:47:42,739 --> 01:47:43,699
That's just the way it is.

1716
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:50,649
Look people have talked shit about like the fake goofy E3 presentations

1717
01:47:50,649 --> 01:47:54,170
and game releases and game showings for years.

1718
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:55,449
And they're not really changing.

1719
01:47:56,409 --> 01:47:58,489
They kind of still follow the same formula every time.

1720
01:47:59,050 --> 01:48:01,289
Yeah it's just a giant sales pitch.

1721
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,489
It's a giant pre-sales pitch.

1722
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:10,699
But obviously Microsoft announced a new console which that's not just like hey

1723
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:14,140
buy uh wash dogs 4.

1724
01:48:14,859 --> 01:48:16,500
I mean that's a new console.

1725
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:21,579
But it is what it is.

1726
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,260
I still enjoy them.

1727
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:24,140
They're still fun to watch.

1728
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:25,899
They're still interesting because they're just like announcements

1729
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:28,220
and sometimes they're exciting things like the George R.R. Martin

1730
01:48:28,939 --> 01:48:30,460
and From Software collaboration.

1731
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,100
How could you not be excited about something like that?

1732
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:34,460
That's a big that's a huge deal.

1733
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:36,500
That'll be a lot of fun.

1734
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:39,319
Hopefully.

1735
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,949
But thank you to Peaceful Haley for that little tidbit.

1736
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,760
Fajita Meat thanks for the five dollars.

1737
01:48:49,479 --> 01:48:50,039
Seems good.

1738
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:52,520
Had a great time watching you watch E3.

1739
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,479
Quick question.

1740
01:48:53,479 --> 01:48:57,079
What's with all the angry faces on your video thumbnails in the German stream archive?

1741
01:48:58,439 --> 01:48:59,399
Wait what?

1742
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:01,000
What do you mean angry faces?

1743
01:49:10,569 --> 01:49:14,539
Well there's there's there's only like one angry there's only one angry

1744
01:49:14,539 --> 01:49:15,500
there's no angry face.

1745
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:15,819
Where?

1746
01:49:16,539 --> 01:49:22,489
I don't see any angry faces.

1747
01:49:22,489 --> 01:49:24,569
I see a little a couple of awkward weirdo ones.

1748
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:29,180
I don't see angry face.

1749
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:34,100
Well I I don't I don't control this channel.

1750
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:36,600
The logos?

1751
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,039
Like the the J?

1752
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:42,329
I don't know.

1753
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:44,300
But thank you for the five dollars.

1754
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:48,939
And finally thank you C4G for the 250 final plus two score was 1876.

1755
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,829
I don't know if the bot posted or not when it was called.

1756
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:54,439
Not bad.

1757
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:01,989
Not bad.

1758
01:50:01,989 --> 01:50:03,989
That's an 1800 plus positive.

1759
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:10,340
But uh see you tomorrow.

1760
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:11,060
Thanks for watching.

1761
01:50:11,699 --> 01:50:14,649
Go enjoy the rest of the last conference that's going on.

1762
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:18,600
See you all soon.

1763
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:20,380
Take care.

1764
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:22,699
And here's uh I'm gonna feed the guild.

1765
01:50:23,579 --> 01:50:24,539
Good night guys.
