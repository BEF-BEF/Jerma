1
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:33,380
You know, it seemed like it was potentially a funny idea. I was gonna- I didn't want to delay

2
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:43,020
the stream though. Oh damn it. Don't freak- don't freak out. That's what they say, don't freak out.

3
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,200
I wonder if I can reach back here. I've been sitting here like this for at least 30 minutes.

4
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,740
I put- I put chicken grease in my hair! Wait a minute.

5
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:16,870
Nice swag, thanks. You look like a Space Channel 5. You can see every like,

6
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,609
inch of my face too. I don't like this. I hate this. Oh! Holy shit, people are so ugly with light,

7
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:31,450
aren't they? Holy shit, people are so ugly. Look at- all right. Oh, Jeremy, you look real handsome

8
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:44,420
today. You sure about that? People are ugly with light on them. So I- I think we just have to stream.

9
00:01:44,420 --> 00:02:00,299
Wait, what do these buttons do? What does this button do? Like a depiction of an angel in the

10
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:15,830
Bible or something. It's like I just be like, like, yes my son. Like, yes. Are you okay? I'm

11
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,990
all right. I gotta shave though. You can see how weird I look. All right, let's go ahead and uh...

12
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:36,250
Whoa! Holy, are you kidding me? Oh no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. See? I'm not ugly!

13
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:47,210
I can't even use this now. You want to see me fucked up? Watch this, ready?

14
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:57,909
Everyone looks like that, okay? Anyways, wait, I need to keep this on. No, I don't. Turn it off.

15
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:09,939
I got it off. The chicken grease worked. Hey, I'll be live in two seconds. It's dual personality.

16
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,539
Oh shit, that's probably loud. Sorry. All right. Hey, stream's starting.

17
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:32,520
Where's Shito? I don't- what? No, there's no Shito today. Shito needs batteries to turn his brain

18
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:44,389
back on and I don't have the batteries that are required. You took Shito off the shelf?

19
00:03:45,289 --> 00:04:00,340
No, I didn't. What are you talking about? He's right there. He's sleeping. He's sleeping. See?

20
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:24,649
I can hear it. Can you hear it? Hey, oh, okay. Geez, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no. I haven't

21
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:38,069
turned him on in like two years. Yeah, I know. Well, you can go back to sleep for a little while.

22
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,959
All right, all right, set it on. Set it on. Stop, stop. All right, I get it. I get it.

23
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:55,560
I'll- okay, yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay. So, shh. Okay, back to sleep. Uh, he said he's very

24
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,160
grateful that everyone thought he was cool and that people were happy that he was going to make

25
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,250
a return. He was mad that I kept him asleep for two years. I did say that- I said I was going like a

26
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,220
long weekend trip two and a half years ago and I was like, oh, we'll just shut you off for a

27
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:19,660
little while. And it's been two years. I will get you new batteries, Shito. Bumber for a little

28
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:28,810
longer. Hey, we're starting the stream soon. Just a minute. Did you smoke crack? What? I don't smoke

29
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,730
crack. I don't smoke crack. I don't smoke crack. I don't smoke a crack. I don't smoke crack.

30
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,220
He's role playing and he's 36. Who cares? Does that- why? Does that even matter?

31
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,920
I can't role play at 36? Okay, well then every actor has to retire when they turn 30. How does

32
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:10,660
that sound? Today, we're gonna- I know I lied. I'm sorry. It will never be an actor. There would

33
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:17,209
never be like a- like an old man in any movie or TV show you ever watch ever again. It'll be people

34
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:29,420
that are like 30 and like 40 in makeup. Okay, so we're gonna play Internet Cafe Simulator 2 today.

35
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:42,889
I know I lied. I said we're gonna play Everhood. I'm really sorry, but I kind of- ow. I- listen,

36
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:48,069
I kind of had a headache and Everhood is a game I don't think you want to play with a headache,

37
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,029
but I've seen some of this game. It looks like it could be interesting. It seems kind of up my alley.

38
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:01,620
I was like, I want to try it. It's a simulator game. Fart Simu- I know.

39
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:12,779
I don't- why would I need to explain it to you? This game is not a game you want to play with

40
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:21,500
a headache either. Why? Yeah, I'm having a good time. I'm just hanging out. Hopefully,

41
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:32,379
you're doing okay too. Pretty cool. This is a simulator game. I beat this in the entire time.

42
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:39,899
I was just wishing I could see you play it. I'm excited. Oh, that's good. You lost 4,000 people.

43
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:56,819
No, I did not. I have my analytics open. I can see my analytics. All right, so let's get started.

44
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:06,759
Let me just stir my coffee not into the microphone. How do you feel about being

45
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:18,310
called an e-clown? I- we made that term up here. That's not- somebody didn't make that term up

46
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:27,720
and then call me that. Like, that's like a- like, only a few communities even use that term.

47
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:37,879
So, who cares? All right. Uh, hold on. Let me get this going here.

48
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,740
I don't even have my dashboard open. What an idiot. Play the game? It's the intro.

49
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:58,679
I just- just give me a second. Oh, there we go. There we go. Okay. Uh, is the camera still on?

50
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:08,970
No. No cam. Off. Is it gonna be a ring light neck stream? Uh, no, I'm not gonna- I'm not

51
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:18,570
gonna torture myself like that. There was also a heated debate in the chat room earlier about

52
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:29,299
hamburger helper and I- I- I feel like I need to- we have to talk about it. I got a lot of shit

53
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:37,289
because- all right, let me ask a really quick question. Do you guys know, in the chat,

54
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:44,309
ones in the chat, do you know what hamburger helper is? Because apparently it was fucking crazy

55
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:49,240
that I- I've been saying- was saying these words. I was like, yeah, a hamburger helper. You get the

56
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,519
cheeseburger mac and what you do is you do this, you do this. Everyone's like, what are you talking

57
00:09:52,519 --> 00:10:02,100
about? What- what is hamburger helper? What- what help what? It's good, yeah. And I was talking

58
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,100
about a little recipe that I had. If you don't know what hamburger- this is what it looks like.

59
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:17,110
It doesn't look like that. Uh, it doesn't look like that. It looks like this. Um, so that's

60
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:29,269
hamburger helper. People would like show us the box. That's- there's the box. I can't even like

61
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:35,899
not laugh at that. What was that? It was- I don't know. It was like an image on my desktop. It comes

62
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:42,549
with real cheese. Okay, this is what hamburger- listen. Hamburger helper is a boxed macaroni

63
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:49,110
product. You take a pound of ground beef and you mix it in with this whole box and it turns into

64
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:57,000
this macaroni dish, right? It looks like this. This one here. Uh, this is a good one. Yeah,

65
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,720
this one. It looks like that. It tastes- it's- I mean, okay, the entire time you're making

66
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,149
hamburger helper, you're grossed out. It's disgusting looking. It feels gross. It's like

67
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,620
you hate it and like you don't even like looking at it. But when you take a bite, it's hard not

68
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:21,539
to eat the whole box. Um, at least, you know, between a few people. So what I said- well,

69
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:31,399
what should I put- let me name this. Um, oh, right. EXP and espresso. It's the name of the

70
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:42,220
cafe. What are you talking about? That's hamburger helper. Is it actually a stolen name? No, it's not.

71
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:51,740
From where? It looks worse though. No, but okay. So you take the hamburger helper, you eat it,

72
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,860
maybe you put a little bit of onion in it, maybe you put some, you know, parsley, whatever the

73
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,100
hell you want, some of the bullshit to make it taste a little better, be a little nicer, whatever.

74
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,820
But my case that I was making to pretty stream chat was what I do, because you ha- you don't

75
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:11,370
just make like half a box of hamburger helper, right? You don't just make one like, oh, I'm

76
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,509
going to make like a third of a box of hamburger helper. It doesn't work that way. So you make a

77
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:22,649
shitload of it and then you store it. And what I said is after you take it out, after you store it,

78
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:28,740
you put it between two pieces of bread or two pieces of toasted bread or bun and you eat it

79
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,230
like a sandwich. You heat it up, you heat the hamburger helper up in the microwave for like

80
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,570
20 seconds or something. And then you put it between bread and you eat it. And then you put

81
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,179
some ketchup on the side and you dip it in the ketchup. I- okay. Even my mods are like,

82
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:51,379
you're fucked up. But that's eating the leftovers though. Okay, you can adapt to the game in a

83
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:58,120
shorter time. Okay, don't worry, they're not boring and long. Yeah, WC, yeah, tab, skills, skills.

84
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:09,049
Okay, I have a punch. That sensitivity is going to go way down. Uh, even more than that. Yeah,

85
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:19,399
you dip it in ketchup. That's better. But it makes the, honestly, it makes the leftovers more

86
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:31,059
interesting. No joke, that sounds really good because it is. I have a punch. Oh, I tried to get

87
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:42,179
my girlfriend to take a bite and she did not want to. In fact, I got a really, really bad look.

88
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:57,480
I don't- it's just leftovers. How do I press- call the elevator, okay. Just be- I have weird- I have

89
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,279
a weird palate sometimes. It's a current- yes, it's a current girlfriend. It's a current girlfriend.

90
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:14,419
I alluded- all right. I alluded to this on Christmas Eve and I think it's time to talk about

91
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:21,429
it. I have a girlfriend. I've had a girlfriend since early last year. I've been pretty private

92
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:32,840
about it for a magnitude of reasons. But ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to announce, she's in

93
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:42,340
the chat right now. Where can we meet her? She's here now. And the reason why we kept it private

94
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:49,799
is because we wanted to- we wanted to find a good place to do this because I didn't want to kind of

95
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:55,139
just throw her into this whole thing and have it be like, oh hey, come on, everybody, you all know

96
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:01,419
who this is? She's a community member and she's been a community member for a while. This is not

97
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:13,879
a joke. It's Halulu. She's in chat right now. It's not you, it's her. It's not- it's not community Jake.

98
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:24,470
Does she know? What? She does. And ever since Christmas Eve, I've- I know people like, what are

99
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,399
you- what are you talking about? What does that mean? How do I get out of the fucking elevator?

100
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:41,750
Do you guys kiss? Of course we do. But I will say this, all through 2020 and into 2021, right,

101
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:48,299
I think I've been dropping some hints to you guys about how much better my personal life was getting.

102
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,700
You've probably seen a few different times where I've been like, hey, it's, you know, somewhere like

103
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,700
at some point last year where I was like, hey, my personal life is going really well. I'm really

104
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:06,149
happy right now. She had a lot to do with that. So, um, we were trying to find the right way to,

105
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:13,299
like, introduce her. She's fucking amazing. So, taking Andy, that's it. All right, I gotta get

106
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:31,990
out of my fucking apartment. How do I leave? Okay, here we go. Is this an elaborate bit? It is not

107
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:48,440
an elaborate bit. But how do I go up the elevator? What- what do I do? Two? One? What? Where am I? I

108
00:16:48,440 --> 00:17:01,620
thought I was- I'm already on the third floor? I thought I wasn't like- oh, okay. Let's go.

109
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,359
But all through 2021, I kept my private life pretty private. I was only streaming, like,

110
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:18,279
once a week. My health was in the fucking shitter. You all know that. Squid game? All right,

111
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:27,109
go to the- go to your internet cafe. Press M. BTC Miner? Okay, that's my home. This is my cafe.

112
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:33,269
I'm ready to fucking rock and roll. All right, can I- I can punch people. I know that for a fact.

113
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:48,220
Wait, this is the sus guy. Don't tell her that. She already knows that. But you'll probably be

114
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,369
seeing a lot more of her in the future because obviously I wanted to wait until we were both

115
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:58,900
comfortable kind of talking about it. So, there you go. There's your- there's your girlfriend

116
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,089
announcement. What the fuck are you doing? All right, so where's- where's my cafe up here?

117
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:26,309
Does anybody care that I just did that? All right, should I hide? That was rude. All right,

118
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,349
grab the mop and clean your cafe. This cleaning this game. So yeah, you know, I'm gonna fucking

119
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:43,059
love it. Any plans for her to feature on the stream? Um, if she wants to- and that's another

120
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:49,029
thing too. I didn't want to like- the reason to keep a relationship private is because obviously

121
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:54,569
you guys know- and I'm- this is real talk here. This is really just me being real. I live a pretty

122
00:18:54,569 --> 00:19:02,299
private life. Besides, like, the public, you know, streams and stuff. So, I like to separate that

123
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:05,900
kind of stuff. But if she ever wanted to do something like that, I'm sure that we could-

124
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:15,529
it would be fun, yeah. He's an enigma. Not- I'm really not, though. Like, that's the thing. I'm

125
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:39,609
really not- I'm really not that complicated. I'm pretty simple. We know. All right, so it's clean.

126
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:48,730
Very cool. We call her the sus lady. I- I don't- I- well, I mean, she's here right now. You

127
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,529
literally- you can ask her. She's in the chat. I don't think she wants to be called the sus lady,

128
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:57,029
though. The electricity's off. All right, let's turn on the electricity. How do I use the computer?

129
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:06,470
There's space to start the computer. No electricity. Oh. How do I turn the electricity on?

130
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:29,400
Oh, shit. All right. I computer case monitor and keyboard mouse on the Xamibzor. Why did you

131
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:42,710
announce your girlfriend while playing Fart Simulator? What? I- I don't know. We're talking

132
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:48,069
about a hamburger helper, and, like, I- she was literally in this house. We were eating it,

133
00:20:48,069 --> 00:21:04,019
and I was- I figured it was a good point. I have a good place to do it. You're feeding her hamburger

134
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:10,339
helper. I'm not feeding- look, she can eat whatever she wants. We eat together. We eat

135
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:15,460
whatever we want. Nobody has to eat hamburger helper sandwiches dipped in ketchup. I just had

136
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:26,380
to validate the fact that it was- this is a real thing I was doing. Okay, buy compute from Xamibzor.

137
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:37,140
War cry? Crack? No, there's- do I have money? All right, Xamibzor. Where's my money? I got

138
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:46,039
two thousand bucks. All right, all right, all right. Computer cases. Buy a computer case. What-

139
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:52,950
do I care which one it is? Old computer case. Add to basket. Is it there?

140
00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:10,599
Uh, computer case, monitor, and keyboard. Keyboard and a mouse. This thing looks like a cell phone

141
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:22,299
from, like, 1992. 1991. All right, now what? All right. Why am I, like, in 800 by 600 resolution?

142
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:31,059
This is about the same dev that made Streamer Life Simulator. I have no idea, actually. That's a good

143
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:50,619
question. All right, so get up. Does she know about Otto? She loves Otto. Okay, so- this is a

144
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:59,779
guy I punched in the face. Why is he just sitting here? All right, that was kind of scary. What

145
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:08,420
happened? What is going on? Why is this- why is this guy walking over here with an exclamation

146
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:16,039
point? Why are there so many just animals? Press E to talk to the beggar. I know everything that

147
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,880
happens in this city, man. You're the owner of that new internet cafe. They smashed the man who

148
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,000
worked at the cafe before you, man. If he got on- if he got on well with me, this wouldn't have

149
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,880
happened to him. If you want to build BTC mining rig in this city, you have to pay me license

150
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:55,670
first. I want to just run an internet cafe, man. Is she taller than you? Oh, okay. No. All right,

151
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:02,710
old computer ca- where do I have to put this? This guy just keeps looking at me. I don't- I don't-

152
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:09,619
this is freaking me out. Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, I get it. I get it. No, I get it. I

153
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:18,519
understand. I want to put it, like, here. I don't- this is- this is it? This is a tiny room. This is

154
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:33,849
a bathroom. Where's the- where's the- what happened to the stuff? Oh, it was, like, blending into the

155
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:48,069
ground. All right, keyboard. And then I assume that I have to put the- what about a monitor?

156
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:58,099
Oh, shit, I need a- I don't have a monitor. All right, I gotta get a monitor. Did you guys come up

157
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:05,259
with Grotto Beast together? Yes, we did. We were actually sitting just outside with a hammer,

158
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:12,200
breaking geodes, and we thought this was, like, a really cool idea. And you've- you've seen a lot of

159
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,339
her stuff. Okay, you remember the sunflowers? I've been, like, dropping hints about this for,

160
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:24,250
like, at least the last six fucking months. Do you remember when I zoomed in on the sunflowers

161
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:32,230
and there was a little picture of Otto? She drew that. She also took all those sunflower pictures.

162
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,019
Everybody was saying, and I remember, they were like, wow, these photos look really,

163
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,460
really awesome. It's almost- did he hire a professional photographer? No, it was just my

164
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:54,230
girlfriend. But no, she's awesome. I couldn't be happier. We were just trying to find, like,

165
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:00,069
an opportunity to kind of talk about it and not be, like, private about it anymore. But I just did

166
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:06,660
that for me, right, and for her. Being private about this stuff was important because you never

167
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:14,440
know, right? Like, I never wanted to make somebody, like, content, right? That was a lot- a huge part

168
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,069
of it until we were comfortable. And if she's comfortable, if she wants to be on streams or

169
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:28,680
something, then yeah, sure. Fuck yeah. Hey, that's the reason why you didn't hear about this

170
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:43,930
months and months and months ago. Could I be your son? No, I don't- nah. She's not real.

171
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:53,579
All right, let's go. No more hamburger helper talk. We're out- we don't have to talk about it

172
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:58,059
anymore. We're over that. It's delicious. It's actually a good way to eat the leftovers.

173
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:05,000
Trust me, I'm a professional clown. That's a- that's a lie. I don't want to get in trouble

174
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,259
for saying that. I made that up. I've never been formally trained as a clown. All right, what-

175
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:18,789
maybe a good monitor? Should I get a good one? How about this one? This one's 350. All right,

176
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:37,160
where's the- where's the basket? Is that too expensive? Should I not buy this? Maybe I

177
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:45,079
shouldn't buy it. Get a CRT. Just get the shit out of me. You just saw, like, the mouse tremble.

178
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:54,069
Should be dual camel prime. Okay, this is so many anim- why are there so many animals in the game?

179
00:27:54,069 --> 00:28:06,170
All right, it's an LCD. So how do I, like, start the business? All right, get the computer ready.

180
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:26,150
Place the products and get the computer ready. Place the products. Is this it? Computers. Setup

181
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:37,529
is not complete. How do I set it up? It's- oh, we need a chair? We're not a cop? Chair. I have to

182
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:46,019
use this, like, outdoor plastic chair? Like that. All right, open the cafe. You can do it from the

183
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:57,190
main PC. Oh, hell yeah. All right, let's go. Cafe closed. Cafe opened. Wait for the first customer

184
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:09,049
to arrive, okay? This guy's been standing here the entire time. I need a chair? I got a chair right

185
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:30,470
there. When's your Vtuber debut? I don't know, man. You should punch that person. I'm not punching

186
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:40,970
anybody. Do I have to do anything else or just people- oh, all right. Customer sent you a request

187
00:29:40,970 --> 00:30:01,750
to turn on the computer. Turn it on. On your computer. I was like, wow, it wouldn't even request

188
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:10,980
to turn it on. Oh, request. Please unlock, okay? You completed the tutorial. Now you can freely

189
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,859
play the game if you want. You can take some quests by walking around the city. The game is

190
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:27,500
saved when you sleep, okay? What, he's just playing? What the fuck? Oh. Four dollars and five cents.

191
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:35,940
Why did you only use the computer for 10 minutes? You could have gone to the fucking library.

192
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:49,660
Why did you do that? Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. What do you want?

193
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:58,970
Please unlock for two hours. Sure. This is my cafe. If only there was a game that could be played.

194
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,470
The cafes that open around here are like shit. Wait, that's why he left? Because they don't have

195
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:14,519
a game? You can't watch porn? Why are you watching porn? You can't watch that. I thought this was a-

196
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:22,140
oh, no, it's not a gaming cafe. Why are you watching porn? Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

197
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:37,099
You can't watch porn here. Leave. Thank you. 23 dollars? Holy shit. It's still- I don't- I'm

198
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:39,740
not watching this. I'm not watching- someone's gonna come and think I'm watching this. How do I turn

199
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,259
this off? I'm not watching this. I'm- this is not on my stream and I'm not streaming. I'm not playing

200
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:48,579
this. Someone's gonna think it's me doing this. How do I turn the computer off? I didn't want to

201
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:53,460
comment badly, but what garbage? Yeah, don't watch porn in my cafe. How do I turn that- how do I get

202
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:04,150
that off? How do I- okay, thank god somebody cut the electricity. Fuck! What? Why is it permanently

203
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:22,420
there? The computer was turned off. How do I get that off? All right, I need to do a quest. It's

204
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:32,519
got screen burning. All right, maybe I should do- should I do a quest? What is that here? The screen-

205
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,150
all right, it's- it can't be there anymore, right? It can't be. Okay, good. It's like rebooting. It's

206
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:56,519
all fucked up. God damn it. Will somebody please come in here and get that off the fucking computer

207
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:06,650
before I get, like, banned? Please? Why is nobody coming to my- I almost said restroom.

208
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:13,690
Somebody come in and use my computer! How do I get- I think that's why- I think I broke the game.

209
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:35,420
Mop the computer? This doesn't- this is how a caveman would handle this. I don't know what to do. Oh,

210
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:40,220
hi sir, how are you? Come on into the internet cafe. Um, I- this is not my computer.

211
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,789
Please, uh, go ahead and do whatever you- oh, yep, let me just go ahead and turn that on for you.

212
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:55,740
Let me just go ahead and turn that on. Ow! What is going on? Why is it making so much noise?

213
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,420
He's just sitting there staring at that right now. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

214
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:11,900
Go back. Thank you. Yes, you're welcome. All right, please do whatever you- but what are you doing?

215
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:20,699
What's wrong? Two dollars. What'd you say? What'd you say? There's only a game- all right,

216
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:28,039
I need a game. I gotta get- I get a game system or something? I gotta get a game. Computer cases,

217
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:41,400
air conditioning, arcade consoles. Yeah, well, I don't have that much money. Uh, PlayStation 1.

218
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:53,559
PlayStation 1. I need a TV for it, right? Yeah, I need a good gamer chair. This one here. And then

219
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:07,719
a- this one. No, one of these. What's wrong? Okay, uh, I need a monitor. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

220
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:12,199
wait, wait. What's going on? Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. What's happening? Oh, go ahead,

221
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:23,670
go for it. All right, let me open up my- where's my cart? I need a monitor. Keyboards, monitors,

222
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:31,210
there we go. Uh, and all- CRT gets PlayStation 1. All right, bye. All right, new stuff coming in.

223
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:46,550
People are talking. I'm the porn place now. Who watches porn like this?

224
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:57,940
Nobody watches porn leaning back like that in the chair. I don't know. Yes, thank you for coming.

225
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:20,900
They do pay a lot of money, though. All right, what we got? Chair. Okay, console. Spray that guy

226
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:28,599
with the fire extinguisher. I'm not spraying anybody with fire extinguisher. Oh, I need a table.

227
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:41,940
Shit. Don't touch this. I probably should get more than one controller, right? My frames are

228
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:53,699
dropping? They shouldn't be. Frames, frames. What do you mean? My frames are all right. What are you

229
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:08,090
on about? It's fine now. I got a 3090. Should I turn the graphics down? Maybe it's just too much.

230
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,050
Oh, well, I think I'm playing on- yeah, I don't think this game is designed to be played on

231
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:22,940
Ultra. Probably better. Oh, what's up? Oh, right. If you'd like to use the computer, let me know.

232
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:31,880
Let me accept this request, and then I'm gonna get a- I gotta get a table. 30 minutes, go ahead.

233
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:42,070
I didn't know what to say. All right, leave. I want- you gonna pay? Customer runs away without

234
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:53,190
paying. You don't really seem to be running. How do I- what do I do? Give me that money back.

235
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:07,800
Um, I didn't- just pay me the money! How do I get the money back? All right, I'll just-

236
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:15,380
why are we fighting out here? Oh god, I'm getting my ass kicked. Watch out, watch out, watch out,

237
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:22,170
watch out, watch out. Can I use this? Oh, shit. Did I get it? Two bucks. All right, somebody help

238
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:34,329
her up. Somebody help her. All that for two dollars. It's not worth fighting over. That was

239
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:52,460
not worth a fight. It really wasn't. I was gonna die. I need a table. Why does the computer keep

240
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,960
turning off? Yeah, it's not nice. There are zero games you can play. Lul. So I'm gonna walk out

241
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:11,079
without paying. All right, table. Desks. Does that count? This is- you can get VR too? Holy shit,

242
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:19,980
I'm invested. Basic console table. Yeah, I'm- I'm running out of money. Oh, shit, I'm actually

243
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:29,400
running out of money. Whoever just comes in here- the people that watch porn literally pay the most,

244
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:55,340
so I don't even care anymore. Where's my mop? You gotta buy the PC games on- oh, okay. There you go.

245
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:07,219
Clean this up. Don't mind me. Don't mind me! Just cleaning up the place, that's all.

246
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:14,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what- that's not

247
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:20,300
what I was doing. I know it looked really, really weird right there. I'm not- okay. Yes, I'm gonna-

248
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:30,619
I'll take that loss, I will. That's my own fault. Oh, finally. Oh, yep, yep, yep, hold on.

249
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:47,219
Thank you. 63 bucks. Whoa! What happened? What? Why did the computer explode? What happened?

250
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:59,619
Did the- was it- wait, did that guy overload the computer with porn viruses? It was a bomb. Oh my

251
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:16,460
god. Okay, that- that was fucking crazy. Uh, all right. Um, what do I do? Um, wait, wait, wait,

252
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:28,920
wait, wait. Is it all broken? Does it still work? Oh, it still works. All right. What? No,

253
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:36,500
one of the guy paid me 60 bucks. He fucking blew up the computer. I like that narrative better.

254
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:43,159
That's funnier to me than the guy came in and blew it up. All right, uh, let's put this over here.

255
00:41:43,159 --> 00:42:05,380
Maybe like in the side edge over here. Right here. There. Uh, this is so cramped.

256
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:20,139
Squid game. Yeah, I- why can I put this here? Is that not- I can't- I need a TV? How is this

257
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:31,610
not a TV? All right, well dual monitor setup over here. Imagine doing a dual monitor with a CRT.

258
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:49,400
I can't do that. All right, now I need to get a- how do- can I sell that thing? People actually do

259
00:42:49,400 --> 00:43:05,739
that. Do they really? All right, I need to get an actual TV. TV. Okay, dude, that's- these are so

260
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:27,460
expensive. These are the only TVs I can buy. Um, I'll just wait till I have money. 30 minutes,

261
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:35,260
unlock. Get some damn game- oh shit, that's right. Okay, how do I do those? What do I get those from?

262
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:50,980
Dude, get a TV. All right, how do I- where do I go? Buy some games. Bill Root Slots, skin case,

263
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:59,849
apps, Steam. A platform where you can buy the best quality games. All right, download. A virus scanner.

264
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:19,139
I definitely want one of those. I only have 230 bucks. Is it robbery? Wait, what? What? What? What?

265
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:40,340
What? Why can't I hurt this guy? Did I get my money back? Try- wait, he tried to pay and I ignored

266
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:59,480
him? No, what? That didn't happen, right? Shit. All right, I got Steam- I got Steam installed.

267
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:07,639
No, no, not happening. Not happening. That guy didn't pay. That guy definitely didn't pay. Did you

268
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:22,900
pay? Why does it say he didn't pay? You didn't turn his PC on. What? He didn't do anything? Why

269
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:36,599
was he here for so long? That's horse shit. Don't run in here. All right. Okay, unlock. Steam should

270
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:54,539
be on there now, right? Okay, apps. Steam. That's- okay, that's installed now. Steam. 120 rush B

271
00:45:54,539 --> 00:46:06,730
simulator. Toss a coin simulator. Uh, cyber hotfix. Fat smoke. Speedrun Half-Life 4. Yeah, that one.

272
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:11,420
All right, I can't- I have no money. I know for a fact that guy didn't pay, so we're fucking- that

273
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:43,050
guy's dead. Oh my god. This is working? You motherfucker. Give me my money! Oh fuck, give me

274
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:57,900
that. Give me that back. Give me, give me, give me. Hey, hey! I'll be right with you. Thermometer.

275
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:15,829
What? What do I do with this? Spray? Oh, it stinks in here. Okay. Excuse me, sir. I- I- I- just-

276
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:24,889
just- basic protocol. Let me just, uh, just hold on for a second. If you need it, uh, if you could

277
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:30,329
just lift your arm- underarms up for just a moment, please. Okay. I'm doing it to me too. Doing it to

278
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:44,360
me too. Give him access? Fuck, I'm so stupid. Okay, I need to- so I bought a PC game. You're

279
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:52,329
wasting it? I don't know, it was- I don't know. This is stressing me out. You're all right.

280
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:57,110
Computers are 20 years behind technology. The cafe's not nice. There are zero games. I was

281
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:02,070
peeing on my pants. It would be great if there was a toilet. Um, where would I put that?

282
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:13,300
Everybody pissed they have pants over there? Who pissed they have pants? Well, I guess I'll take

283
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:21,590
care of it. It's one of those squid game guys. Get out of here. All right, all right, we're going.

284
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:55,590
Pay me a bunch of money and play a game. What are you doing? 15 bucks? I need way more money than

285
00:48:55,590 --> 00:49:08,260
that. Let me clean up. All right, I'm not going to mess around anymore. I'm actually going to try to,

286
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:24,900
like, win. Change your prices. Oh, I can do that. Okay. Uh, right. Okay, I'll do that. Go do a quest.

287
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,340
I'm- I don't want to leak. Should I- can I close this place? Oh, I can. All right, I'm going to

288
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:37,659
close the cafe. Give me one hour for free. I'll increase the score. I don't know how to do that.

289
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:50,630
Uh, okay. Let me- computers. Okay, here we go. Change the price. All right, normal. 1.2. That

290
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:59,349
sounds good. All right, now I'm going to close- I'm going to go see if I can do a mission. I'm going

291
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:02,469
to take the bat with me though for, like, protection in case somebody tries to kill me or something.

292
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:23,769
Can I close it? All right, I'm ready. I need a mission. Go around the city and look for a

293
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:42,179
mission. There was that, like, bitcoin guy. I was- map? Secondhand shop? There's the club. Rabbit club.

294
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:51,500
100 bucks to go in here? I don't think so. I- these guys scare the shit out of me,

295
00:50:51,500 --> 00:51:05,559
don't they? What's- oh, this is a store? All right, what's in here? Sells secondhand items.

296
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:18,070
Oh, nice. All right. Buy a disc. Buy a bat. Cardboard. VR. Oh, you can buy cheap stuff here.

297
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:27,719
PlayStation VR controller. That's kind of cool. All right, kill the store owner. I'm not doing

298
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:35,980
that in the first 40 minutes of me playing this game. No. What's this? Oh, this is my house.

299
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,389
All right, I live here. I was stuck in there for, like, 15 straight minutes.

300
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:51,860
BTC miner. I need a quest. Oh, no, it's the same guy just stumbling around. Go to sleep and save

301
00:51:51,860 --> 00:52:12,599
the game. What's going on in here? What is this? Oh, it's a- it's a streamer cafe?

302
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:26,539
Where's Bugleberry? What else is here? Is this, like, uh, apples or a fruit or something?

303
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,900
Like, this- okay. Should I- I don't want to give this guy 100- oh, I only have 100 dollars left. I

304
00:52:38,900 --> 00:53:05,130
don't want to give the guy 100 dollars. Get out of my- stop. Squid game. Wait, that is- is that

305
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:14,150
XQC? Look at the shirt. What is this shirt he has on? It's him, like, aged, like, 50 years.

306
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:32,969
Where's he going? Dude, they, like, they, like, mapped his face. This is crazy. What? Why is Donald

307
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:43,059
Trump in this- this game is fucked. Okay. I hope XQC comes to my cafe. Hey, XQC, by the way, just

308
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:53,449
let you know. Five star VIP service to come to my cafe. Five star VIP service. In fact, we can get

309
00:53:53,449 --> 00:54:01,099
a car to pick you up, bring you to the cafe. I'll give you a hot towel. Any game that you want. We

310
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:09,340
probably have it in our- on our disposal. I need to save the game. All right. All right, all right,

311
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:23,349
all right, all right. This is- we got a shitload of porn. I don't mean- I don't know. All right,

312
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:37,400
I gotta save the game. Go home, right? Why am I so invested in this game? Okay. That's crazy.

313
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:58,840
It's a mapped- his mapped face. Nice immersive- more immersive than cyberpunk. Why do we not move?

314
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:14,389
What is going on? Remember, you're in it too. I am not in this game. I'm definitely not in it.

315
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:49,900
What does that do? All right. So now the game is saved. Very cool. I'm not smoking. No, not before

316
00:55:49,900 --> 00:56:04,199
work. What's on floor two? I haven't even looked. Hey, do you think Jerma is going to read this?

317
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:28,889
Absolutely. All right, back to work. All right, I gotta- I gotta get to my cafe. Is this pre-recorded?

318
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:42,219
No. Oh, by the way, by the way, I can give you a hard date now, I think. I think I can give you a

319
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:48,900
hard date on a big stream. So I said it was going to be somewhere in the end of January, maybe.

320
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:56,360
I hope Community Jake does not want to strangle me after saying this, but I believe we can say

321
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:02,179
that February 1st, I would be here if you want to see a big stream. I'm not going to tell you what

322
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:12,489
it is. Wait, turn the lights on. Is it going to be special guests? Confirmed. It's going to be

323
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:18,150
interesting. I- I will tell you right now. I'm not going to say shit. I will keep reminding you,

324
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:25,210
but this might be my top three favorite streams I've ever done, without a doubt. Maybe even top

325
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:42,809
two. I don't know. It's looking like it could be a really fun time. Am I invited? Of course you're

326
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:53,260
invited to watch the stream on February 1st. All right, I gotta open this door. Open. I keep hitting

327
00:57:53,260 --> 00:58:05,530
escape and I'm stupid. Let's go ahead and open. How am I going to reliably make any money? I have

328
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:20,230
$130. When are you going to do the naked ketchup bath stream? That would be so weird. What are you

329
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:34,039
talking- Good afternoon. Welcome to EXP and Espresso. Can I get you an espresso? I don't

330
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:39,849
have that yet. We will though. It's part of the plan. Limitless. This guy's going to be here all

331
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:59,909
day. Oh, hell yeah. It's clean. How does it smell in here? It smells pretty good. I thought

332
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:08,340
something was riding on top of the dog. This guy wants to be in here all day. That's good on me.

333
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:24,460
Should I pay the guy $100 just to get another quest or something? Back to the back of the guy's

334
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:31,110
head. All right, I'm just going to do it. Here. Drop by me from time to time. We seem to get along

335
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:44,260
well with you. Now you can buy BTC Miner if you want. I only have $30. Excuse me? Oh, sorry.

336
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:16,070
He's been here for a long time. I hope this guy gives me like $200. Can I do anything else here?

337
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:28,260
Can I make any money? My cafe. This is all too expensive. All right. Crypto. I- I don't have

338
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:36,360
enough money to do any of this. Just buying and selling crypto. Bills? Thank god I don't have to

339
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:50,070
pay any bills. Mail. Swap machine. Oh, no. Nope. Not- Holy shit, that's there. Okay, I know that's

340
01:00:50,070 --> 01:01:07,500
there. Skin case. Oh, man. Clothes. No. Warcry coin? You own zero Warcry coin. 100 Warcry coin

341
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:14,059
is $10. Convert the coins you earn in Warcry into real money. You better not fucking leave without

342
01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:31,619
paying. He was in here for like six hours. It was 100 bucks. Got it. Wait, how do I play? How do I

343
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:42,360
play? What's Warcry? Game I can play? All right, what's crack? Welcome to crack world. New IP.

344
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:48,500
Example. Join server. Security IP address is constantly changing. Okay. I don't get it.

345
01:01:53,590 --> 01:02:14,139
Don't turn my electricity off. Do a command. What am I supposed to do with that? Crack world.

346
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:25,210
Welcome to crack world. What am I supposed to do with this though? That's kawaii. Play claw machine.

347
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:32,889
Can I- Is this where I get the coin things? Oh, my god. This game was literally- This game was

348
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:49,030
literally made for me to play it. Look at all those. You won six coins, right? It's 12 dollars

349
01:02:49,030 --> 01:03:05,989
every time I do this? I got a diamond though. What's that worth? What's a diamond worth? Okay,

350
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:15,289
so now what do I do? Sell coins. Sell the- Whoa! Are you kidding me? Holy shit, that's awesome. All

351
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:20,619
right, I'm gonna do this for like an hour. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I got it, I got

352
01:03:20,619 --> 01:03:38,659
it, I got it. Minimize, minimize. Uh, I know, I know, I know. Jesus, get over there. What a shitty

353
01:03:38,659 --> 01:04:01,019
place. What was the ding? Can you extend my time? Yeah, sure. Oh, my goodness. Extend me? You- Why

354
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:12,179
didn't you stay? All right, I'm going back in there and I'm doing that claw game again. All right,

355
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:26,599
let's go. Games. Coin drop. Definitely this one. 25 bucks to drop a coin. Five- Oh, yep. That's five

356
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:38,679
purple diamonds. Get it again. Back to back. That's- I'll take it. Do it again. Right in the middle.

357
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:58,469
I'll take it. One more, that's it. And I'm gonna cash out. Oh, fuck yeah. Nice. Hell yeah. It was

358
01:04:58,469 --> 01:05:06,599
not as much as I thought it was gonna be. Let me check- I want to just check the other ones.

359
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:19,050
The other ones look kind of cool. Okay, they have games. Hit reward? What do you want? Yes, you can

360
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:29,079
say as long as you want, as long as you pay. I don't care. All right, slot- Hit reward. What's this

361
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:42,599
one? Row? 40 dollars to throw this knife. What'd I get? Oh, you're looking for the green. All right,

362
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:52,659
maybe one more. Shit. All right, one more. That's it. Last one. Did I get it? All right.

363
01:05:53,380 --> 01:06:01,929
Actually, truly the last one. I got the green. Fuck yeah. Actually, not a joke. Hand to my heart,

364
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:24,010
hand to the grave. Done. After this next one. All right, cash out. All right, I literally lost like

365
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:34,260
10 dollars. Whatever. That guy leave? No, he's still here. I need to buy a TV for this console.

366
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:41,139
I spent some- Whatever. I'm gonna sneeze and I'm gonna try to catch it. I'm sorry.

367
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:52,949
I got it. I think I got it. Buy some crypto. I'm not gonna- I don't want to buy crypto.

368
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:59,539
I only have 200 dollars. I want to see what other like funny little games I can play.

369
01:06:59,539 --> 01:07:25,659
Slot machine. 50 bucks? Oh, fuck you. What about the lucky wheel? Wait, 97 bucks. Hell yeah. All

370
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:37,500
right. Hold on. I'm making money. I'm fine. No, no, no. It's getting dark. Wait, it's the squid game

371
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:44,409
guy. It's the squid game guy right here. I stopped being like, oh, I'm the squid game guy. Relax.

372
01:07:44,409 --> 01:08:08,119
You're fine. I'm gonna overact. You still have to pay for the time you're here. Where's my eyes?

373
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:15,510
Oh, I can look in tighter. Okay. Remember, this place sucks. I just opened it. I'm trying to get

374
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:26,260
some money. Once I get to a thousand bucks, I can buy, um, because of the virus. The virus.

375
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:30,729
Yeah, maybe it's all the porn you've all been watching. Okay, where's my virus scan?

376
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:48,140
Uh, where is it? Let me spin this first. Okay, apps, virus. Where is it? Oh, there it is.

377
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:56,170
The number of computers connected to the network, two. Start scan. Phone number of

378
01:08:56,170 --> 01:09:07,960
46 viruses. This reminds me of when I would be at a grandparent's house and you'd run.

379
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:12,279
They'd be like, oh, yeah, you could use my computer. If you need to use a computer at

380
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:17,720
a grandparent's. Oh, yeah, the computer's upstairs, sweetheart. Yeah, it works. I've got,

381
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:23,079
I've got Microsoft on there. And they don't even ask you to do this, but you just do it because

382
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:27,319
you're just going to half because you're curious and half because they don't know what the fuck's

383
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:34,439
going on. You just run malware bytes or like Windows Defender on their computer. Yes, because

384
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:39,000
it's just the first thing you do. Um, and I remember I did that one time and I think there

385
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,920
was, I'm not kidding. There was probably like thousands of like adware and shit like that on

386
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:48,710
it. And you don't even tell them you're doing it either. That conversation does not even need

387
01:09:48,710 --> 01:10:06,569
to happen because they would, oh, speaking of like overacting, that was like the ultimate

388
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:17,180
overacting. Oh, I got hit by the shell in Mario Kart. If I did voice lines for Mario Kart, like

389
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:30,819
I just got hit by a fucking trap thing. Why are they, okay, how do I stop them from happening?

390
01:10:30,819 --> 01:10:39,220
Why do they keep doing that? Why, like, why are they like coming here and like blowing up the,

391
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:47,180
why are they doing this? Please pull on, please apologize to my girlfriend. After you thief

392
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,460
stream, I told her you'd be playing Everhood on Wednesday and we were very excited, but here we

393
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:59,859
are and there's no Everhood. I know. I'm sorry. I lied about it. I'm sorry. I'm, I'm actually sorry.

394
01:10:59,859 --> 01:11:04,500
I did say I was going to play. I did say I was going to play Everhood. It didn't end up happening.

395
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:10,920
Very sorry about that. I kind of had a headache earlier and I feel like that was not the kind of

396
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:19,670
game to play with a headache. I will play Everhood. You can be rest assured. At some point I will play

397
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:43,369
Everhood. I'm so sorry. I don't, I'm really nervous. I'm so sorry. What was that? We just

398
01:11:43,369 --> 01:11:51,510
laughed. That was weird. Okay. How much money do I have? How long does it take to do virus shit?

399
01:11:53,430 --> 01:12:08,869
Did they get it? Or did the explosion screw this up? Did the explosion mess it up? Don't

400
01:12:08,869 --> 01:12:23,539
even tell me that's what happened. I got 324. Treasure hunt. Get more, no more keys left.

401
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:33,899
One key is, okay. So I'm going to buy five keys. What do you think guys? Up right? Good call.

402
01:12:34,539 --> 01:12:51,479
Right in the middle? Eh guys, come on. Middle left? Center left, yep. Middle right. Oh man,

403
01:12:51,479 --> 01:13:01,720
these are bad, bad choices. Bottom left. It's okay. All right, what else we got? I didn't do

404
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:21,899
lucky wheel. I want to try it. How do I do it? I'll spin 15. All right, do it again. Green is the most

405
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:37,739
expensive it seems, right? All right, actually the final one. I'm not doing this ever again.

406
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:48,460
All right, that's it. Ash out. We got 177 worth. I just keep ending up with the same amount that

407
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:58,600
I came in with. What about this Warcry coin thing? Stop turning the electricity off. Whoever's doing

408
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:12,810
that. Is there a reason why no one's coming in? Turn the Warcraft game into real money. Hold on,

409
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:32,180
how do I do that? PC's not assembled? Apps. Employee. Data so we can find some employees. Warcry.

410
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:42,979
There it is. World's greatest MMO game. Download now and start earning real money. All right,

411
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:59,699
that's downloading. Is it really not assembled? Oh, that's why. Okay, that's stupid. Are we clean

412
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:13,239
though? I think so. Chair. Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot. I got it. I'm going to sell this.

413
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:30,550
We're closed for a minute. Secondhand shop right here. Hey, what? You're being searched for what?

414
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:38,180
What? What's going on? What's happening? Why am I being searched? You've been fined for not obeying

415
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:45,350
police stop warning. What the hell are you talking about? What? I'm walking down the street with

416
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:50,069
my computer monitor to sell to the secondhand shop. What do you, what do you mean by that?

417
01:15:50,069 --> 01:16:01,590
What'd I do? I got something for you. I literally stopped when he said stop.

418
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:25,430
Even think about it. All right, do I have enough to buy a monitor? Wait, I can play that game.

419
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:42,970
I have a bill due. Please stop penalty. Come on, fuck off. Okay, how do I play it? Warcry classic.

420
01:16:42,970 --> 01:17:06,010
Start game. What? Interact. What is this? Interact. Sell item. What is this? This is actually,

421
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:19,000
you can play this guys at level 12. How am I supposed to kill these? They sound like something.

422
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:32,710
What do they sound like? Oh my God. What is it? Heart of darkness. I came from PlayStation one.

423
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:59,739
How many coins do I get? This hurts my head looking at this. Can I do another move?

424
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:23,979
Has anybody come into this restaurant yet? Okay. Open. I can't open. Open it. Open this. There's

425
01:18:23,979 --> 01:18:42,920
nothing even in these. This guy's a quest upgrade item. Why? I don't even have any money. The loot

426
01:18:42,920 --> 01:19:08,229
despawned. What level are these guys? One? Level two. All right. Dude, why is there nothing in these?

427
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:20,859
Finally. What is it? Jello? Free game. No complaining. It's a free game. You don't have

428
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:37,829
the season pass. This is a health potion. Okay. Are you going to stream the new war crime expansion?

429
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:45,020
Um, I'm actually not like that happy with like the direction that the devs have taken it. The amount

430
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:49,260
of damage that it used to, they, they did, they changed the scaling on damage. At least that's

431
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:57,369
their plan. And I mean, I've been playing this game since like 2013 or something. So it's like

432
01:19:57,369 --> 01:20:01,380
as somebody that's been playing it for a while, it sucks. Well, I mean, it's probably a good excuse

433
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:07,960
for me to stop playing it. This is my, I mean, we're in the stator zone for the new guys watching,

434
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:16,340
but this is probably I like 40th or 50th character. That's probably a good idea,

435
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:25,979
but try something else. If they end up fixing it though, I'll probably come back. Yeah. The

436
01:20:25,979 --> 01:20:31,659
change in bags lots too, which is, I mean, I love this dev team and shit, so I don't really want to

437
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:39,590
talk that deeply about it and to kind of be overly, I would say not, I don't want to be mean or

438
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:42,949
anything, but cause I mean, I, I truly, I love this game and I love the community and everything.

439
01:20:44,489 --> 01:20:51,460
But I don't know if the new lead director needs to, needs to give more input from the fans and

440
01:20:51,460 --> 01:21:12,869
stuff, but I'm just not fucking happy with it. I'm going to sell these though. Worst joke taking

441
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:21,210
more than five minutes. It's only been 30 seconds. Wrap it up. All right. All right. Wrap it up,

442
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:31,800
Jeremy. Wrap it up. All right. All right. Wrap it up. That's felt like two hours. Oh, stop,

443
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:39,109
please get out of there. I'm trying to pass the time so I can sell, by the way,

444
01:21:39,109 --> 01:21:47,880
is anybody even in the fucking store? Why is nobody in here? Has electricity been off? Oh no,

445
01:21:47,880 --> 01:22:08,489
my progress. I'm sitting here. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Okay. Devs did something right.

446
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:27,779
Auto save. Okay. I'm almost, this is actually kind of hard to control. I'll be honest.

447
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:47,270
I'll be honest. Open. All right. I'm turning this stuff in. I'm done. Okay. Can I use this to craft

448
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:59,289
or something? Upgrade. Belt. No, it just costs coins. Let's sell. Hello. What the fuck? Where's

449
01:22:59,289 --> 01:23:02,090
the booty bay guards? Where's the booty bay guards? What the fuck is going on here?

450
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:25,859
Where are the guards? What the fuck was that? How much do I get? I only have 34 coins. What

451
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:37,850
can I do with these? Can I even turn these in? How do I get, like, what do I do? How do I get

452
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:49,930
out of this? Oh, okay. So now I go to Warcry coin. It's only ten dollars to convert a hundred of

453
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:58,489
those coins. I'm never opening that ever again. 433 bucks. Why is nobody coming into the store?

454
01:24:05,699 --> 01:24:13,340
It really wasn't open. You guys weren't kidding. It's all right. Whatever. Just gamble instead.

455
01:24:13,979 --> 01:24:26,250
Yeah, that's not a bad idea. That's not a bad idea. The monitor's not connected yet. It is.

456
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:34,260
I know the control is on the ground somewhere. Where is it? Hey, what the hell are you doing?

457
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:51,979
What are you doing? What are you doing? Give me that back. What is that? Wait, I heard that

458
01:24:51,979 --> 01:25:07,420
laugh before. Oh, you idiot. Why? Stupid. Did he take the controller? No, I think it's on the

459
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:26,420
ground over there. Get it? Flush. Thank you. Clean this up. I only have room for two things anyways

460
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:33,960
in this damn place. Whatever. Did he steal the other monitor? No, I sold it. I got rid of it.

461
01:25:35,449 --> 01:25:50,920
And the tower. Where is it? There it is. I need it. Please decorate. I don't have any money.

462
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:58,869
I'm going to gamble $200. And then whatever happens from that, we'll smush it into decorating.

463
01:25:58,869 --> 01:26:17,029
I saw that guy's back. No, he's not. All right. I thought I saw him sneaking by.

464
01:26:17,029 --> 01:26:23,319
Even think about it. All right. He's not here. All right. What do you say we do a little gambling?

465
01:26:23,319 --> 01:26:40,819
Why not? Do I buy a case? I'm going to buy a best case for $300. All right. Come on.

466
01:26:40,819 --> 01:26:46,899
Any of these good? I got two knives. Those are two knives. That's worth like $1,000. I just won.

467
01:26:46,899 --> 01:26:58,460
I just won the game. There's literally two knives in here. What do I do? 160. Wait. Do I sell this?

468
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:04,579
What's happening? What do I do? What do I do?

469
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:26,619
Excuse me. Hey, what's up, man? How you doing? Good to see you. Good to see you. Yeah, I just

470
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:33,020
opened up this cafe and I'm good to see you. I've got games for you if you're

471
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:40,300
ready to go. You can check out whatever we got on the thing over there. Just take a look.

472
01:27:41,619 --> 01:27:44,659
I can get you situated. I can get the whole package going right now.

473
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:49,590
30 minutes is fine, dude. If you want to stay for like an hour, you can. I don't give a shit.

474
01:27:49,590 --> 01:28:03,699
You know what I mean? You can just stick around. An hour, two hours, it don't matter. Oh, no.

475
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:17,529
Oh, no. I mean, you know, I'm just going to look the other way on this one.

476
01:28:17,529 --> 01:28:29,850
I'm going to look over here. Hold on. Hold on. Let me get up. I got to get up from the seat.

477
01:28:30,649 --> 01:28:34,409
Thank you. No, no, no. I'll take the money. I'll take the money, please.

478
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:41,930
No way. He's leaving without paying. I was my fault. I'm sorry. I should have actually put

479
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:46,420
my hand out and then taken that money from you. You know, let's just call it even. It was really

480
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:50,979
great to see you. If you ever want to come back, by all means, we love having content creators come

481
01:28:50,979 --> 01:28:56,500
over and check out our stuff. And yeah, I mean, we could just say that this was kind of like a

482
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:02,420
little collaboration and it was really good to have you. You can tell people about us and maybe

483
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:38,310
you come back next time and maybe we have a good time. Okay, we're open. Pet the cat. Okay. Minus

484
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:50,180
two. You should have hit him. No, I can't. How do you pet cat? I mean, this, I know like it's like,

485
01:29:50,180 --> 01:30:00,550
oh, he's going to left click. I'm not, I'm not going to punch this cat. Oh, check his review.

486
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:12,229
Yeah. What did he say? Let's see. If more beautiful girls come, I'll increase the score. He gave me

487
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:22,340
five stars. That's pretty good. I think that's not, that's not bad. Wait, does he, is that implying

488
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:47,979
that if there was more porn, if I had more porn? Oh man. I need to get to downloading. I can,

489
01:30:47,979 --> 01:30:59,770
how do I uninstall this? All right. So now 290, wait, right. So how do I get, I have like all these

490
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:13,420
skins and shit. I have a knife. Can I sell these? Do I have an inventory or something? I only got

491
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:26,810
one. This is it. Where is it? Wait, what? You only, it only gives you the one. How do I sell it? I

492
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:44,600
already got the money for it. No way. Oh shit. All right. Come on. All right. I just got fucking

493
01:31:44,600 --> 01:32:08,739
absolutely annihilated. All right. I'm done. I'm done. That's it. No more. Oh, what's he playing?

494
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:23,319
He's playing half life. He wants more time. You got it. He's playing a game. So this is going to

495
01:32:23,319 --> 01:32:30,939
be worth more money. All right. What's this whole, I actually have to stop messing around. I keep

496
01:32:30,939 --> 01:32:47,180
just blowing my money and gambling in an arcade machine. They generate a ton of money. All right.

497
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:54,739
Actually no more gambling. I don't want to do that anymore. That's stupid. What about food? Ending

498
01:32:54,739 --> 01:33:01,460
machine. This game's kind of cool. I need to restart. I don't think so. I have 440 bucks.

499
01:33:05,739 --> 01:33:08,939
I screwed up because I bought a bunch of console stuff and I thought I could just put a TV on it

500
01:33:08,939 --> 01:33:21,079
or a monitor. There's actually a lot of stuff. I'm very interested. This is, this is a lot of fun.

501
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:31,930
Let's cope. It's not, it's not cope. I like the game. I need to wait till he's done.

502
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:43,880
So what should I, I have no bills I have to pay. All right. He wants to pay. Let's go. How much

503
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:53,750
you, that was an expensive experience. Wasn't it? 79 bucks. It seems fun in a dumb way. It's just,

504
01:33:53,750 --> 01:34:07,109
it's just, all right. Gamble on the fruit slots. I would have so much more money if we didn't do

505
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:16,010
any of that. All right. I'll do it for a minute. I was peeing on my pants. It'd be great if there

506
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:21,609
was a toilet. By the way, if more beautiful girls come, I'll increase the score. How do you increase

507
01:34:21,609 --> 01:34:36,069
the score over five stars? You really kind of don't. Excuse me. Excuse me. No, put that down.

508
01:34:36,069 --> 01:35:20,550
Excuse me. I only did that because she, are we open? $20 bet for, okay. Spin. $20 bet. What

509
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:38,949
am I even looking at here? What are the lines? Buy a free spin for $2,000. What a rip off. I'm

510
01:35:38,949 --> 01:36:00,539
not going to hit anything at all. Yeah. I got you. Come on. Um, what the hell? All right. What's

511
01:36:00,539 --> 01:36:29,180
that worth? This thing sucks. What do these do? What? That strawberries right there. How is that

512
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:43,140
not a line? How is this not a line? Come on. Come on. All right. That's going to be worth like

513
01:36:43,140 --> 01:37:01,609
a hundred bucks. That was something. How much was that? What are you doing? Thanks for coming.

514
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:14,279
50 bucks. All right. No more gambling. Do a virus scan, please. What time is it right now?

515
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:31,300
One. No new customers come after one o'clock. All right. So let's close. Fucking goddamn virus

516
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:45,739
scan. Do the claw machine one more time. I need to buy an arcade machine. I don't have, dude,

517
01:37:45,739 --> 01:37:51,689
I got to tell you up front here. Every time that we get more than $400, I go back to zero.

518
01:37:51,689 --> 01:38:11,100
I wish it was warmer. Yeah, so do I. It's January though. I buy more of these. I guess I'm just

519
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:22,739
going to sit in here all night and play Warcry Classic. Oh right. The virus scan. You can't even

520
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:29,539
get past 300 bucks without gambling it away. I promise I am not going to spend a single solitary

521
01:38:29,539 --> 01:38:38,579
cent until we get to enough money where I can put it on that console table. I'm not going to spend

522
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:46,380
another dime. Not one dime. Make a prediction. Go for it. You guys want to bet on that? I will

523
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,979
not spend another dollar until I have enough to buy a TV for that console. The PlayStation one

524
01:38:51,979 --> 01:39:07,079
over there on the on the table. Make a prediction. Trust me. I got it. I got this. I feel like this

525
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:15,109
would be pretty, um, be pretty trivial in a few hours. All right. It's doing it. Just don't turn

526
01:39:15,109 --> 01:39:34,550
the electricity off. Clean this place up. A little dirty. I'm not going to spend any money. I promise.

527
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:54,970
You can do it. I'm going to tell you guys right now. If you bet against that, you're going to lose.

528
01:39:54,970 --> 01:40:05,460
If you say no, I will not be able to avoid spending. You're going to lose. The controller

529
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:12,420
is still on the floor. Well, yeah, because I can't really do anything with it now. I need a TV.

530
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:22,920
What about if you get fined? No, that does not count. It only counts if I physically spend the

531
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:29,159
money. Not something that I have to pay. Like bills or the police fine or something. No. It has

532
01:40:29,159 --> 01:40:38,300
to be I spend it. Like I go, oh, I'm going to buy this or I'm going to gamble. No, it doesn't count.

533
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:54,739
Hundreds of viruses. There we go. Cool. All right. It's a new day. I haven't slept in probably three.

534
01:40:55,300 --> 01:41:05,260
So let's just relax and go forward, right? Just relax. Shut up. The fuck up. All of you. And let's

535
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:18,489
go from here. I'm going to put this in a better place. Like in the corner so I know exactly where

536
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:40,899
it is at all times. Let's go. Open the store. Open for business. $92. Come on in. Maybe there's a

537
01:41:40,899 --> 01:41:46,569
quest or something I can do. Adjust the prices. Should I just make it really expensive and get a

538
01:41:46,569 --> 01:42:08,899
bunch of bad ratings and who cares? Does that, do I really care that much? 1.3. Hello. Yep, that'll be

539
01:42:09,539 --> 01:42:21,720
computer number one. I've got you. Is she naked? No. What? What are you talking about? She's

540
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:35,260
watching stock footage or the beginning of every YouTuber video you've ever watched in your whole

541
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:41,909
life. Anytime any YouTuber has ever gone anywhere in their entire life has been this shot every

542
01:42:41,909 --> 01:42:48,239
The only thing that's missing is the plane, um, the plane wing out the window.

543
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:54,859
The plane wing.

544
01:42:54,859 --> 01:43:00,130
Have I ever done that?

545
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:05,210
Have I ever done the, I'm going on a trip, I'm filming out the plane window?

546
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:06,210
Have I ever done that?

547
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:16,470
I don't think I have.

548
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:18,350
Don't you think it'd be kind of funny?

549
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:26,010
What if I made a video, and, hold on, what if I made a video where it was just like me

550
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:30,229
introducing that like, hey guys, going on this big trip, it's gonna be so much fun,

551
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:31,390
and we'll see ya!

552
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:39,260
And it's just like, four minutes of planes taking off and landing out the window.

553
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:47,630
It's just like that, I'm going up, out the window, and then it like, it cuts to me like

554
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:54,010
holding like a drink on the plane, like, mmm, and looking in the camera, where's the computer

555
01:43:54,010 --> 01:44:03,819
up?

556
01:44:03,819 --> 01:44:08,739
You already made this years ago, what?

557
01:44:08,739 --> 01:44:13,340
Just upload the whole flight, yeah, yeah, it's like, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

558
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:21,399
Out the window, and then it's just, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and you're just

559
01:44:21,399 --> 01:44:27,060
sitting there in the seat, just sitting there looking around, it took a six hour, seven

560
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:34,960
hour video.

561
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,579
You're shifting around and just stretching your back, you get up to take like a piss

562
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:40,520
and it's just still sitting where the seat is.

563
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:44,289
Oh no, don't make it a time lapse.

564
01:44:44,289 --> 01:44:48,260
Wait, somebody want to, shit, I wasn't paying attention.

565
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:50,359
Is he doing that for free?

566
01:44:50,359 --> 01:45:02,000
I should buy a monitor?

567
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,800
I'm waiting till I can afford it.

568
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:08,369
It's open?

569
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:17,770
It's true. Yeah, just have it be the whole flight is the video and then at the very end

570
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:23,699
It's just like the point you get off the plane and it gets into like a like, oh, I'm in I'm in the uber

571
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:24,539
Oh, here we go

572
01:45:24,539 --> 01:45:27,840
And it cuts like I'm in the Hoja and you see like in the top right like a battery

573
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:37,579
It's like blinking and it just cuts in the video ends. Yep

574
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:58,779
Then the next videos you're getting on another plane the dollhouse behind the scenes starts with an airplane window shot

575
01:45:59,779 --> 01:46:04,319
It does

576
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:31,090
Does it actually let me see let's investigate this I want to see now it doesn't

577
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:57,750
Where in the very beginning? I don't listen to that. It does. Oh fuck. It actually does. Let me see

578
01:47:08,770 --> 01:47:10,770
Doesn't right?

579
01:47:10,930 --> 01:47:16,560
It does hold on

580
01:47:20,729 --> 01:47:27,130
It doesn't that doesn't count that doesn't count that's a plane landing that's not a plane out the window with the wing

581
01:47:27,649 --> 01:47:33,210
Going up. It's got the right music though. It has the right music. I will give you that. It's the correct music

582
01:47:33,729 --> 01:47:38,010
That doesn't count. It's a plane. It's it's a plane going down. It's not like playing going out back to counts

583
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:42,300
It does sure. Yeah counts fine. Okay. Oh

584
01:47:55,039 --> 01:48:08,939
I have not been paying attention at all. Is this person still here? It counts. That's fine. Okay, 214 bucks

585
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:18,520
how long till the prediction ends until I either spend money on something I'm not supposed to or

586
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:38,649
I buy the thing that I'm supposed to buy. What can I do for you? I changed my desktop background to a quest

587
01:48:38,649 --> 01:48:40,409
I'm I don't want to just leave

588
01:48:40,409 --> 01:48:43,949
Look, I did like the Bitcoin quest and the guy was like, hey

589
01:48:43,949 --> 01:48:51,079
I've got to go to my Bitcoin store and never even went there's the only quest I had another customer

590
01:48:54,050 --> 01:49:02,850
Thank you. What can I get for desktop wallpapers? Can you actually get them? I want something better

591
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:09,960
I'm gonna just click that. All right. Where do I okay bill mail clothes?

592
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:26,000
What do I get it was peeing smells disgusting, okay, I'm going home to pee

593
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,010
Why would you go home?

594
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:39,840
Okay, how am I supposed to get a bathroom?

595
01:49:48,979 --> 01:49:50,899
Well, stop pissing on the ground

596
01:49:50,899 --> 01:50:02,250
Maybe that would be a easy way to make it doesn't smell in here anymore. You can expand the store

597
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:04,890
Let me I need to have more than one person here at a time

598
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:41,760
Is there a bunch of viruses on this thing again? There's so many viruses again. It's dirty. It is reduced lots

599
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:47,859
No, I need a TV and that's priority number one because once I get a TV I can have double the income

600
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:59,569
We're trailing so far behind. I've been here for two hours

601
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:03,680
Jeremy your excuse was that you just started but pay me

602
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:26,090
No, that's not gonna happen. There's the bat. Yeah, arrest him. What this the guy just stole from me

603
01:51:26,369 --> 01:51:40,640
He just stole from me. Oh

604
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:43,020
Fuck I didn't mean to holy shit. I didn't mean to hit you

605
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:45,020
I was

606
01:51:45,100 --> 01:52:09,520
Can you please open the image that you've had in the very beginning of this one? Oh, what about it? I

607
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:33,199
Didn't spend any money actually. Oh, come on. I was right there. Hey for what you've done

608
01:52:33,659 --> 01:52:42,140
What I didn't spend money. I have to pay the fine. I haven't paid the fine yet

609
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:50,560
See, I have four days to pay $50 penalty. I'm not paying it

610
01:52:50,579 --> 01:53:23,020
What's up, you added the stipulation that it didn't count if you had to pay for it. Yeah, that's true

611
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:38,819
But I mean, I don't want to spend $50 right now if I don't have to I even go over to the BTC thing

612
01:53:38,819 --> 01:53:55,460
That's that TF classic. It's not enough. It is for the quest. All right, but not I'm

613
01:53:55,979 --> 01:54:02,229
Rowing along here. What time is it? All right. I have to say I gotta save the game. It's been like an hour and a half

614
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:05,909
Turn the lights off

615
01:54:05,989 --> 01:54:45,560
Clean up close the store. All right, I gotta go home and save the game. That's just silent. We have a such a silent community

616
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:52,180
Silent what do you mean?

617
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:59,760
Oh

618
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:06,479
That's what was happening in the very beginning of the screen. I was what the hell's happening to me. I couldn't go anywhere

619
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:42,359
This isn't thrillville. No, it's internet cafe simulator another day. I'm ready. What is that image?

620
01:55:42,359 --> 01:55:56,460
Oh, that burger is me

That's a picture of me. It's me. It's my face

622
01:56:18,699 --> 01:56:41,090
It's supposed to be like this. It just looks funny. Your mouth looks like among us

623
01:56:41,369 --> 01:56:48,789
No, it's not supposed to look like that

624
01:57:04,779 --> 01:57:06,340
He took a picture

625
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:11,939
After I was like in the head in the back of the head with a bowling pin and I'm on like the ground

That is not you. Yes, it is. I swear to God. That's me

628
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:40,590

719
02:17:51,319 --> 02:17:57,219
I know you play League of Legends. No, I don't want to play League

720
02:17:57,219 --> 02:18:07,159
I that's the last thing I'd probably ever do I would cover myself in peanut butter

721
02:18:07,159 --> 02:18:13,540
I'd like a roll around on the ground before I played one game of League of Legends on stream

722
02:18:19,389 --> 02:18:34,239
Need money

723
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:37,920
600 bucks. That's all I need just stay here for a long time

724
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:41,780
I don't care what you do your free reign to do whatever you want and go wherever you want

725
02:18:41,899 --> 02:19:06,139
Whatever I don't care just stay here and pay me money. Okay, still here. Yeah. All right, Dan still scanning

726
02:19:06,139 --> 02:19:10,069
Just go beat up Vin Diesel. It pays well

727
02:19:10,069 --> 02:19:19,379
I tried to beat up Vin Diesel, but my back broke across his cement body my bat shattered on him

728
02:19:19,379 --> 02:19:47,860
Let me get some money here. It's not bad almost there. Just maybe like another three customers and I'm good more tips

729
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:55,129
All right, where's am I? Do I have a tip jar? I?

730
02:20:04,450 --> 02:20:21,399
Can't beat up Vin Diesel with my bare hands. What did I do? Why would he do that?

731
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:54,219
All right watching YouTube. All right. I'm if I can is there a block. That's not block. Is that me? Oh, I'm laughing. Oh

732
02:20:55,479 --> 02:21:02,090
Okay, so now I get it. Never I've been hearing that person laugh. I think I've I've been accidentally pressing it

733
02:21:02,129 --> 02:21:17,389
It's been me. You're gonna do a live-action family guy roleplay stream. I don't believe so

734
02:21:17,389 --> 02:21:38,500
No, that's your middle finger button. No, I'd say this is zero chance of that happening. Okay, we're good

735
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:49,100
All right, I need please let me know can I actually fight and beat Vin Diesel one on?

736
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:59,829
One he killed me in one hit last time. I don't think I'm ready

737
02:21:59,829 --> 02:22:13,469
I don't know what I keep thinking of like Trump putting the mask on from the mask

738
02:22:13,709 --> 02:22:31,340
That's all I see the Jim Carrey mask. Oh, so somebody stabbed me

739
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:40,920
You can't vote for that for the worst joke of the year. It didn't take five minutes to set up

740
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
P-a-r-t why?

741
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:49,719
No

742
02:22:49,719 --> 02:23:07,000
Believe me because I gotta I'm sorry you can't I you can't vote for worse impression every year if I do a shitty Trump

743
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:17,819
I do a bad Trump every year more than once a year. So don't you can't nominate it. It's all it's gonna happen

744
02:23:17,819 --> 02:23:46,409
It's gonna be bad every year. It's cold in here. You have enough money to gamble now

745
02:23:46,409 --> 02:23:54,079
I am so close to actually being able to play this game correctly. I'm not going to do that

746
02:23:54,079 --> 02:24:16,120
There are 20,000 people here. Holy shit. What are y'all doing here? Just vibing. Yeah. All right me too

747
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:21,069
All right, close close close close. It's your birthday. Happy birthday. I hope you have a good birthday

748
02:24:21,069 --> 02:24:31,200
All right. I am so close. How much is the TV?

749
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:54,920
$650 I'm almost there for life. I'm here from that reddit video the reddit videos

750
02:24:55,040 --> 02:25:05,739
So funny like this community has made me more popular without me even doing anything. I didn't even do anything

751
02:25:05,739 --> 02:25:31,770
I just like my face existed. All right, this would be it right here. The sus guy the serial killer

752
02:25:31,770 --> 02:25:38,389
They'll look I'm hearing again thing. I have nothing to do with any of these things. None zero

753
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:55,069
I find out about them when you do so those who that are coming from some of the stuff that you've seen on reddit

754
02:25:55,270 --> 02:26:00,959
Amen. Wow, what's this on the front page? It's literally we're at the same time

755
02:26:00,959 --> 02:26:05,989
You and I are both going like this. Whoa, man. What's this on the front page?

756
02:26:06,309 --> 02:26:12,030
So I open up my phone you open up your phone. Whoa, man. What's this on the front page?

757
02:26:12,309 --> 02:26:15,350
We both do the same fucking thing at the same time. I have no idea what they're gonna do

758
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:20,389
I don't have no idea what what what we're looking at. I have no idea. I am usually shitting

759
02:26:20,389 --> 02:26:38,559
I didn't do anything. I'm being stolen from move move. No, I don't fight two people

760
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:53,139
No, don't fight three people run. I got my money run that climbers

761
02:27:00,409 --> 02:27:05,770
Get out of here close the door close the door. I just like sniper bullets to go by me. What was that? What was that?

762
02:27:06,370 --> 02:27:09,110
What the fuck has happened? I just saw bullets go by me

763
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:13,040
How are you walking through a door?

764
02:27:14,479 --> 02:27:50,959
We're still open. I'm not warming the inside. Why did you hit L on?

765
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:56,360
No, he was I he was blocking the way so I'm trying to get around him and jump over the

766
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:13,040
Railing you know play Deus Ex probably not any game that is more than

767
02:28:13,479 --> 02:28:16,959
20 to 30 hours you'll probably never see on this stream

768
02:28:17,180 --> 02:28:20,049
the only exception is from software games and

769
02:28:20,489 --> 02:28:27,040
If I get obsessed with something or like a week make me like monster entry or whatever this you'll do it

770
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:36,950
This is gonna do it about Dawn of War. Yeah, I mean if we

771
02:28:37,469 --> 02:28:42,020
Maybe be kind of fun to get a bunch of streamers to just play a huge game of Dawn of War

772
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:51,739
I think that'd be funny everybody kind of a basic rundown how the game works and have a gigantic like

773
02:28:52,100 --> 02:29:07,360
12 person streamer RTS battle the teams all right come pay so I can buy a TV

774
02:29:07,860 --> 02:29:14,770
Are you gonna stream all of?

775
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:23,129
Elden ring yes, I have played every from software game that is released

776
02:29:23,530 --> 02:29:29,149
In the last six years or so on this stream to completion. I'm going to do it again

777
02:29:29,530 --> 02:29:34,979
You only stream two days a week though

778
02:29:34,979 --> 02:29:41,629
I mean when a big release like that comes out that I've been looking forward to I I will play more if I can

779
02:29:41,989 --> 02:29:46,389
What about the new fable is there a new fable coming up?

780
02:29:46,430 --> 02:29:55,770
All right, this would put us over the edge. I think yep, all right finally

781
02:29:57,829 --> 02:30:07,620
$668 it's time to buy the TV. I would like for the mods to pay out

782
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:15,420
I did it. I told you not to doubt me, but a lot of you did anyways

783
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:23,579
It's the last piece of this puzzle, and then I can start making a bunch of money on the console games

784
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:46,600
Diesel's right there. Why can't I just like spin spin spin spin spin spin spin tornado punch right here right in the head?

785
02:30:46,680 --> 02:31:08,250
I would be able to win. I don't want to steal this nobody take this please say Elon Musk again. I just did yes

786
02:31:09,729 --> 02:31:12,940
on soul TV

787
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:15,579
finally

788
02:31:15,579 --> 02:31:35,959
Consoles I need a second controller all right. I have $18. It's rain. There's actually weather in the game

789
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:54,680
I'm just gonna sell like the thermometer or something what about like breath of the wild or breath of the wild to I've outcome clean

790
02:31:54,680 --> 02:32:02,989
I know a lot of the older viewers know this but maybe the newer ones don't I don't I'm not I don't really

791
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:11,600
I'm not a big Zelda fan. I don't get excited for Zelda the breath of the wild

792
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:17,850
I know it's an awesome game, but it's a Zelda game, and I can't go over that hump for some reason

793
02:32:17,850 --> 02:32:31,159
I never really I was never truly into the Zelda games the last Zelda game that I really played or really cared about was probably

794
02:32:31,959 --> 02:32:41,370
Probably ocarina of time if I'm honest and then Twilight Princess. I remember playing it and it's just like

795
02:32:41,729 --> 02:32:46,920
Opening your eyes underwater in a pool, and then getting out and looking at lights

796
02:32:47,959 --> 02:33:13,079
The Twilight Princess was pool vision for the whole game, and I couldn't play it you didn't pay god. I'm getting headbutt

797
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:17,920
$11 man

798
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:36,059
Give me another controller controllers. Why are they so expensive?

799
02:33:52,989 --> 02:33:55,110
What oh my god

800
02:33:56,350 --> 02:33:58,780
Okay

801
02:34:01,399 --> 02:34:13,200

803
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:27,399
There's guys that are in squid game outfits that are going to like explode your business. I don't understand

804
02:34:27,879 --> 02:35:00,030
Why are they doing that? Why why why they in squid game outfits? That's good. How does it smell in here awful?

805
02:35:00,069 --> 02:35:11,729
Okay, I think we're good electricity back on

806
02:35:12,329 --> 02:35:29,760
This needs the keyboard back good. Okay perfect. I need that other controller

807
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:41,520
I love this dream German really just says buzzwords. I do I just say buzzwords

808
02:35:41,639 --> 02:36:06,940
What do you mean what buzzwords there's so many viruses on that computer? I need a bat to fine

810
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:23,700
Has anyone paid in

811
02:36:23,860 --> 02:36:44,559
Two days Jesus all right this whatever this like tinky-winky guy go up here get on get on get on get on

812
02:36:44,799 --> 02:37:27,930
Need to get a security guard. I have $30 dude 30 bucks la la clean

813
02:37:28,209 --> 02:37:47,030
Please pay said you were never gonna say that again. No I didn't I said I'm never gonna say the e word again the temperature

814
02:37:48,989 --> 02:38:01,319
15 degrees in here 15 degrees Celsius

815
02:38:01,319 --> 02:38:10,010
That's not that cold is it was that like 50 60 50 45 or something how hot is that yeah?

816
02:38:10,049 --> 02:38:28,600
That's not even that what how's that cold 59 is cold yeah

817
02:38:28,600 --> 02:38:39,850
I know we've had the conversation about how hot or cold a room should be right people think I'm crazy

818
02:38:40,049 --> 02:38:50,200
We're not wanting to be in a house. That's 67 or 68 degrees. I I want my place to be between 72

819
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:56,049
73 between like 72 and like 74

820
02:38:58,399 --> 02:39:07,040
68 is might as well be an icebox. It's a it's a walk-in freezer people turn their

821
02:39:07,969 --> 02:39:11,840
Thermostats down at night because did you get better sleep or something right?

822
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:17,809
Oh, I turn my thermostat down to like 65 at night. I would die in 65. I would be dead

823
02:39:17,809 --> 02:39:22,340
I would wake up dead. That's too much way too cold

824
02:39:25,399 --> 02:39:39,420
72 is perfect being in a colder room promotes better sleep. I guess some some study from somebody

825
02:39:39,420 --> 02:40:03,340
I don't know no not happening 64 is perfect. No don't leave without paying don't leave without even the money

826
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:07,069
What why does nobody pay?

827
02:40:07,750 --> 02:40:16,819
Why does nobody pay I didn't give him access to the computer, then why was he there using it?

828
02:40:16,819 --> 02:40:23,940
He should have been using it, so he didn't have access to it, but he used it anyways

829
02:40:24,020 --> 02:40:48,549
So he used it and then just left. I'm getting a bat how much is that?

830
02:40:48,549 --> 02:41:07,440
I'll take it see it looks like his legs. Oh how much are the controllers 80 bucks all right?

831
02:41:07,440 --> 02:41:38,549
That's better than buying it 120 all right. Where's Vin Diesel? I'm not messing around now. He broke the bat last time wait

832
02:41:38,549 --> 02:41:45,409
Will he actually break it have to pay the fine?

833
02:41:45,409 --> 02:41:56,219
I'm five cents short fine whoever comes here has no self-esteem

834
02:41:56,500 --> 02:42:16,370
Okay, ooh nice that has a wear meter is that why it broke not because Vin Diesel's like stacked and

835
02:42:16,969 --> 02:42:32,139
So wait I actually can can get him with it does have a wear meter all right. I'm going for it

836
02:42:52,030 --> 02:43:07,159
Tell your friends about the consoles that we're about to add if I see Vin Diesel he's getting it there

837
02:43:07,159 --> 02:43:30,979
He is there. He is he's right there. I don't want to hit four people with this didn't they double team me earlier

838
02:43:30,979 --> 02:43:36,870
These two oh

839
02:43:40,219 --> 02:43:52,979
That was so sly very did you hear that where is he yes all right? Do I get money for this?

840
02:43:56,229 --> 02:44:11,459
200 bucks that's really good. Don't even think about it. I was already left without paying all right

841
02:44:11,459 --> 02:44:21,670
I'm gonna go buy a controller, and then I can actually use that and that I'm gonna make that expensive

842
02:44:21,989 --> 02:44:35,940
It's from right here shit. What do I do?

843
02:44:36,889 --> 02:45:17,309
He's still owe me that he owes me that right he owes me that thing all right nice. Hell. Yeah, thank you finally

844
02:45:17,709 --> 02:45:28,520
It's only taken two hours to do it do I like coleslaw?

845
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:35,979
Yeah, it depends not really the only place I've really ever liked coleslaw from was Canes

846
02:45:35,979 --> 02:45:46,809
And that's because I like to so after you eat Canes once you've you got like the sauce you got the you know

847
02:45:46,809 --> 02:45:49,850
Whatever the the fries you get the chicken. That's kind of all over inside of the

848
02:45:50,690 --> 02:45:52,870
Kind of styrofoam thing whatever

849
02:45:53,149 --> 02:45:55,030
When it all mixes together

850
02:45:55,030 --> 02:45:58,989
let's say you take a bite of a sandwich or you eat like a piece and it kind of falls into the

851
02:45:59,149 --> 02:46:01,030
Kind of well that you have in front of you

852
02:46:01,030 --> 02:46:09,219
I like to dump the coleslaw in afterwards and I kind of mix it all up and just eat the coleslaw with all like

853
02:46:09,219 --> 02:46:17,319
The junk that fell out of the sandwich and stuff. That's the only time I really eat it all right

854
02:46:17,319 --> 02:46:25,209
I have it's it's we're gonna make this two bucks an hour. It's expensive

855
02:46:25,569 --> 02:46:46,180
We're doing it the bat is ready to go. I'm gonna enjoy some console games. It's fine, too

856
02:46:46,180 --> 02:47:02,649
That's right. He eats hamburger helper. Why are you all surprised?

857
02:47:02,649 --> 02:47:14,280
He eats like a starving rodent hamburger helper is good on salt. We don't have to have this conversation again

858
02:47:14,639 --> 02:47:43,059
There are no games for the console really I mean she's in here, okay nice

859
02:47:43,299 --> 02:47:47,360
All right, then I'm gonna get an arcade machine to go in the corner

860
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:59,680
I wouldn't feed hamburger help which are my greatest enemy. It's why it's so easy. It's such an easy dinner. It feeds it feeds like

861
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:08,000
60 people when you make a box all it is is just ground beef and the box. It's really easy to make

862
02:48:08,040 --> 02:48:19,870
It's really hearty. It's really filling. It's good. I said this in beginning of the stream

863
02:48:19,870 --> 02:48:30,200
It's gross when you make it, but after it's done, and you take a bite you go. Holy shit

864
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:47,209
This is insane. My mom used to feed me hamburger helper all the time pretty sure it's why I have whatever

You brown it in a pan

02:49:53,239 --> 02:49:56,440
And then you put the box in with some water and some milk and you stir it up

875

943
03:05:30,799 --> 03:05:37,000
I like this Christmas thing by the way Bloor Dow is working on the winter one and it looks awesome

944
03:05:37,000 --> 03:11:18,129
I can't wait to switch to it Christmas one more time. Why not one more for Christmas? Let's go you got dude flushed himself

945
03:11:26,219 --> 03:11:49,719
Alright, let's go. We we're in the flushed away universe now fucking god damn it. I forgot my water

946
03:11:49,719 --> 03:14:06,149
Give me a sec. All right complete refill. Let me turn this back up. He's got a full glass who does the songs Bloor Dow

947
03:14:06,309 --> 03:14:16,719
He is a talented individual and he is currently working on four or five new tracks

948
03:14:16,760 --> 03:14:26,180
Which is awesome and we should be very excited also a new winter themed BRB screen

949
03:14:26,340 --> 03:14:29,090
Please package your pee and send it to me. No

950
03:14:31,909 --> 03:14:44,420
I'm not gonna package my pee. Why did I read that? I don't know. I just I read the I read the weird shit

951
03:14:44,420 --> 03:14:46,579
Okay, I'm sorry. That's the way it is

952
03:14:47,159 --> 03:15:05,479
I'm all refueled. I did rock and roll ready to rock and roll. What was the last thing I was doing?

953
03:15:05,879 --> 03:15:32,799
Fueled with he'll know not heal just regular water. Thank you for always reading the weird shit. Yeah, I know it

954
03:15:32,799 --> 03:15:51,600
Just it stands out like a sore thumb. It really does. I did it. Okay trash can I need a trash can

955
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:59,170
I'm sorry for calling you the Ted Bundy of twitch that time. Yeah, sorry somebody just run out

956
03:15:59,170 --> 03:16:30,399
This guy's been here for a long time. I just okay. I looked down. I was like, why do I have three dollars? I had four

957
03:16:31,270 --> 03:16:35,569
Hundred like ten seconds ago. Why do I have only three fucking dollars?

958
03:16:35,569 --> 03:16:47,799
How much is Dogecoin gonna hopefully the devs put it like a joke in the game or something where like Dogecoin goes like

959
03:16:47,799 --> 03:16:54,620
Up like five million percent. I'm just gonna make sure that I always have like a hundred bucks in Doge in this game

960
03:16:54,940 --> 03:17:08,030
Because they're probably gonna do that only you left. Okay. All right. Did I just break it?

961
03:17:08,030 --> 03:17:10,989
Why is it this guy kicked me once what?

962
03:17:14,760 --> 03:17:35,659
Everybody's paying without god. They both just left without use the bat. I just didn't it broke on his head

963
03:17:35,739 --> 03:17:44,780
All right, if I gamble again, I'm gonna open it we're gonna clean up

964
03:17:44,780 --> 03:17:54,500
I'm gonna open the store if if I gamble again, I'm gonna turn off the stream

965
03:17:54,500 --> 03:17:56,940
Okay

966
03:17:56,940 --> 03:18:06,479
Over the next 30 straight minutes over 30 minutes if I gamble again stream turns off. I am saving money

967
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:23,139
No more bullshit. No more gambling. Can we bet on that?

968
03:18:23,700 --> 03:18:30,899
No, no, you don't have to bet on that. All right, how much is a bouncer?

969
03:18:30,899 --> 03:18:46,790
I feel like a bouncer is gonna be more money than I'm even making I would have like

970
03:18:47,350 --> 03:18:57,190
1500 I'd have at least a thousand dollars right now upgrade the punches on the way

971
03:18:57,190 --> 03:19:10,430
They want extended time extended time the scratch ticket. God watches the stream ends in ten

972
03:19:10,430 --> 03:19:22,340
It does not end in ten minutes. Don't you go and go up yet?

973
03:19:22,340 --> 03:19:27,739
No room if you could do a voice for a cartoon what we do

974
03:19:27,739 --> 03:19:38,059
I'll probably auto feel like Otto would be a fun voice to do for a cartoon. All right, 70 bucks at 80 bucks

975
03:19:38,059 --> 03:19:52,579
That's really good. You smoke in here. I think I didn't even do anything

976
03:19:52,579 --> 03:19:56,739
But I knew I mean he was he was creepily walking into the store, right?

977
03:19:56,739 --> 03:20:07,180
I mean, that's not illegal, but it was up. It was a little odd. I mean that guy whatever, you know what I mean?

978
03:20:18,850 --> 03:20:24,659
Hold my god. I have a lot of

979
03:20:25,739 --> 03:20:34,069
Wait, did I punch this guy's neck backwards? I've re break it go chiropractor

980
03:20:34,510 --> 03:20:51,610
All right. Now money's absolutely rolling in now. No gambling at all till at least 8 p.m. Pacific

981
03:20:51,610 --> 03:21:03,329
You understand 8 o'clock Pacific. I'm not gambling a cent till at least then I need to okay

982
03:21:03,329 --> 03:21:08,280
I need to warm it up a little bit in here. It's a little cold but the price is up a little bit

983
03:21:08,280 --> 03:21:24,760
There we go. All right. I'm confident now. I'm good. What what do I need? What do I actually but maybe the

984
03:21:25,139 --> 03:21:39,979
What are you what can I do for you? What do you want? What do you want? That's weird

985
03:21:39,979 --> 03:21:47,909
I think it smells in here. Does it? Oh my goodness. It stinks in here. I have no cans empty

986
03:21:47,989 --> 03:22:08,670
What does it smell like in here? I have to go buy a stink remover. Whatever it is buy some Bitcoin miners

987
03:22:08,889 --> 03:22:30,319
We go crash into the computer. That's fine. Oops. Oh

988
03:22:35,409 --> 03:22:41,850
It's cuz it's an old PC. Is that why this thing keeps doing this?

989
03:22:41,850 --> 03:23:10,139
Give me a second man. The the fucking place is on fire. Okay, feel good. I'm ready sell the empty

990
03:23:10,799 --> 03:23:25,489
Extinguisher and buy a new one. You're almost out. All right, you know, everybody just go home. Go home. Go go go

991
03:23:25,489 --> 03:23:31,569
Get out of here. Go home. Take it

992
03:23:32,290 --> 03:23:40,899
That was up. Oh my god. All right, electricity off everybody out. I'm going to sell the extinguisher

993
03:23:40,920 --> 03:24:02,350
There's no electricity. So nobody who's gonna even go in there. Nobody cares. What can I sell this for? That's not bad

994
03:24:02,510 --> 03:24:10,329
Can I buy one how much are they? All right, I definitely want to take it the whole place can't burn down

995
03:24:10,329 --> 03:24:38,850
That would be awful. What about spray cam? Yeah. Okay. It's time to go to bed. Is the place closed?

996
03:24:39,129 --> 03:25:04,760
Nobody can even do anything anyways, just close it up. They have a game close this up over here, right?

997
03:25:04,760 --> 03:25:26,000
Yeah, and I call you know into the stream voice. He hates streaming

998
03:25:27,600 --> 03:25:31,290
Let me get that out of your head real quick

999
03:25:32,170 --> 03:25:44,139
Say that's not an end of the stream voice. I just haven't saved the game in like an hour and a half

1000
03:25:53,639 --> 03:26:35,909
Let me out the city getting more populated. I feel like there's more people here now. What what happened? Okay. Okay, they're okay, right, right

1001
03:26:35,909 --> 03:26:36,909
It smells it smells. All right

1002
03:26:36,909 --> 03:26:45,000
Let me buy another can of spray lean the place up and then I'm gonna buy an arcade machine and then we're gonna make a ton

1003
03:26:45,000 --> 03:27:13,180
Of money, I promise 15 bucks. All right, good to go. Oh the empty can leave me alone. Stop. Yeah, I did

1004
03:27:13,280 --> 03:27:24,190
Okay, there's a new quest as well. Um, let me go see what that is. Hey friend

1005
03:27:24,190 --> 03:27:28,110
I heard that electricity is constantly turning off these bastards are deliberately closing

1006
03:27:28,590 --> 03:27:32,379
The electricity to take bribes if you give me 200

1007
03:27:32,379 --> 03:27:35,340
I'll bribe those punks for you and they won't turn off the electricity ever again

1008
03:27:35,340 --> 03:27:57,479
I don't really care at this point takes two seconds to turn it back on. Hey, that's not worth $200 do it for the quest

1009
03:27:57,479 --> 03:28:08,229
I'll do it once I get an arcade machine, which let's take a look. How much are those? It's up by 5%

1010
03:28:08,750 --> 03:28:28,440
Alright, hold on to it arcade machine. That's not expensive. That's it

1011
03:28:29,680 --> 03:28:37,860
325 I got that right now. Alright, I got it. Why not? I'll do it. That's cheap

1012
03:28:37,860 --> 03:28:53,620
All right, where's that empty spray can no more bad reviews and then I'll do the perks

1013
03:28:53,620 --> 03:29:03,250
I've almost took a whole imagine spraying an entire can of Febreze in your house. That would be awful

1014
03:29:03,250 --> 03:29:11,659
It'd be worse than it's smelling bad more customers coming to the cafe

1015
03:29:11,659 --> 03:29:24,200
Let's do that customers are greeted with a pleasant conversation and may ask for extra time or punch two. Yeah

1016
03:29:25,540 --> 03:29:33,260
You're much better at handling the baseball bat because of your background baseball bats can break more easily. I don't know if I want that

1017
03:29:33,260 --> 03:29:35,670
I'll take this though

1018
03:29:35,670 --> 03:30:06,399
Please don't should I put this in the corner? I set a price price for this you will get to that

1019
03:30:06,399 --> 03:30:13,620
I hope how much is that computers?

1020
03:30:15,670 --> 03:30:27,020
Orders computers requests. Where is it? This thing is really janky. Yeah, but how do I just does it just work?

1021
03:30:27,020 --> 03:30:56,940
It's just auto pay. Oh, okay. Cool. Very very nice. That's better. These are sponge ball bubbles

1022
03:30:56,940 --> 03:31:04,930
They kind of look like it don't they I need a new bat too. Yeah, I'm out of bats

1023
03:31:05,049 --> 03:31:20,409
Okay, open 20 bucks should come back pretty quickly. I gotta run get a bat wicked quick wait

1024
03:31:20,409 --> 03:31:44,579
I don't have the money. Never mind. Never mind. Come on in. Yeah, the arcade machines facing the wrong way. What?

1025
03:31:44,579 --> 03:31:54,040
No, it isn't. It just looks like shit. That's why you think that it's $30 to use the arcade machine

1026
03:31:54,059 --> 03:32:00,180
Why did I buy any of this other crap? What was the point of me buying any of this?

1027
03:32:00,180 --> 03:32:09,930
I could have bought just three or four arcade machines and just let them just roll

1028
03:32:09,930 --> 03:32:19,069
It takes two seconds pays better the more expensive the arcade machine is I'm gonna get another one

1029
03:32:19,069 --> 03:32:30,030
Remember is it true that you draw on your eyebrows? Um, I'll neither confirm nor deny that statement

1030
03:32:30,030 --> 03:32:32,780
Oh

1031
03:32:34,139 --> 03:32:37,590
Viruses I'm just gonna pay for the monthly

1032
03:32:38,309 --> 03:32:51,059
Daily virus service thing. Thanks for that. Can I get a I said this earlier, but is there a barrel?

1033
03:32:51,059 --> 03:32:54,729
Can I get a barrel three thoughts on the earth's core?

1034
03:32:54,729 --> 03:33:01,670
We have no idea what it looks like we made up everything that we think is in the earth's core

1035
03:33:01,670 --> 03:33:18,569
Don't all run as one person

1036
03:33:21,209 --> 03:33:48,170
Help help protect your king protect your king protect your king. No, please why I need to hit you with a head

1037
03:33:48,170 --> 03:33:54,510
I can't even fight you though. Even I've got level two fist powers and I can't even do anything about it

1038
03:33:54,510 --> 03:33:59,559
Let me get you. Oh my god that guy's deck. I was about to walk away with a hundred and

1039
03:34:00,079 --> 03:34:08,459
$70 worth of game time that guy slept here overnight. That was a hotel room. Okay, don't leave without paying

1040
03:34:08,459 --> 03:34:26,930
I'm gonna say it once wait, you didn't okay. Good

1041
03:34:27,370 --> 03:34:40,979
300 bucks is an entire upgrade menu that you're ignoring this one here. Don't leave without paying. It's so annoying

1042
03:34:40,979 --> 03:35:09,270
I I clicked request on that guy. No, it's in the apps really employ data so you can find employees

1043
03:35:09,270 --> 03:35:12,549
All right, great program that allows you to use the computer more professionally

1044
03:35:13,270 --> 03:35:31,700
Minor device and then Spotify. All right. Well, we'll do this now that guy didn't pay either not gonna hit you

1045
03:35:32,219 --> 03:35:44,180
Okay, everyone's fucking I don't want to spend I gotta hire a bouncer

1046
03:35:44,620 --> 03:35:55,139
Immediately what? No, don't ignore the people punching me in the face though. Yep. Thanks for the thanks the search

1047
03:35:55,180 --> 03:36:01,350
I appreciate it. Yeah, forget about the people that are attacking me

1048
03:36:06,809 --> 03:36:17,889
Request coming in. How's it? Yes. I know I know I know I know let me guess you're not gonna pay

1049
03:36:18,450 --> 03:36:47,500
Shocker, it's so dirty in here. The arcade pays immediately

1050
03:36:47,620 --> 03:36:53,610
That's why I'm wondering my why do I even have any of these consoles or computers or anything?

1051
03:36:53,610 --> 03:36:56,370
What's the point they get the arcade cabinet?

1052
03:36:56,370 --> 03:37:02,590
It's not gonna get a virus and people aren't gonna walk away without paying they have to already have paid

1053
03:37:02,590 --> 03:37:17,739
I just sell them and just line the wall with cabinets. I'm paying it

1054
03:37:17,940 --> 03:37:35,770
No, you need variety. Okay money will start to actually really roll in here soon. I'll be good

1055
03:37:35,790 --> 03:38:09,700
Where's all this trash that I don't see I don't want to fight you but I will if I have to well

1056
03:38:09,700 --> 03:38:19,569
I don't like I might I don't know what that guy was doing. You're not gonna walk away with $77

1057
03:38:19,569 --> 03:38:25,100
I'm sorry, just max out the prices one people just leave. All right

1058
03:38:27,979 --> 03:38:33,420
625 dolls. I've got some new apps

1059
03:38:34,530 --> 03:38:40,709
Employees protect your shop from all kinds of attacks neutralize your enemies with a very fast reaction

1060
03:38:40,989 --> 03:38:45,809
This $300 for a day five day three, what's that mean?

1061
03:38:45,809 --> 03:38:55,000
I feel like I'm reading like the months of the year and stuff like EU. What does this mean? Oh bouncer

1062
03:38:55,520 --> 03:39:13,049
Nightmare thieves and non-paying customers $260 every three days. All right, where is he? Oh nice. All right

1063
03:39:13,489 --> 03:39:29,040
So he beats people up for me. That's awesome. Now. I don't have to worry about it. What else can I do a

1064
03:39:31,190 --> 03:39:36,690
mascot

1065
03:39:36,690 --> 03:39:51,870
Sure, is this stupid? Where's the mascot?

1066
03:39:58,579 --> 03:40:07,299
They are now everybody come on in come on come all and here

1067
03:40:07,299 --> 03:40:14,920
I just paid $200 the quest line is gonna go and my electricity will never turn off that leaves me with a grand total of

1068
03:40:16,969 --> 03:40:27,989
$15. Oh my god. He stole the TV. Oh my god. Get up. Yeah

1069
03:40:37,860 --> 03:40:42,520
Kick was insane. I'm back. I was worth it

1070
03:40:42,520 --> 03:40:57,409
That was definitely worth it without a doubt right to the back of the head to Wow. All right, cool

1071
03:40:57,489 --> 03:41:10,000
This doesn't doesn't seem to be working. How does it smell? It's not good. We're good

1072
03:41:10,000 --> 03:41:28,299
This thing was 600 plus dollars. Yeah, that would be so sad if I didn't see that come on in in the meantime

1073
03:41:28,540 --> 03:41:30,540
What are the other apps? All right, I hired some employees

1074
03:41:31,059 --> 03:41:43,719
It's minor average mining power not be reached. You could not be included in the network average mining power

1075
03:41:43,719 --> 03:42:02,969
I don't have enough power. Hey, I mean the chair probably radiates. I don't think I can clean the chair

1076
03:42:03,250 --> 03:42:12,780
So if they leave it out paying they get a roundhouse kick from that guy in the head. He's worth it

1077
03:42:31,100 --> 03:42:49,290
Request get rid of the panda. Did you pay? I don't think so. Oh, no, no, no. He did the arcade cabinet night

1078
03:42:49,290 --> 03:43:13,950
Yep, I can't clean this. It's just dirty. She gets more games. All right, how much money after I get paid another one or two times

1079
03:43:14,090 --> 03:43:31,889
He's quick too. All right. I like this guy. That's a good idea putting this near the door

1080
03:43:31,889 --> 03:43:44,610
I don't panic every time so if I put it near the door

1081
03:43:44,610 --> 03:43:55,959
Then I will see them play and then they'll leave and I won't freak out about it. I'm into that

1082
03:43:56,000 --> 03:44:06,729
Yeah, cuz see that when I see somebody run out it freaks me out put it over here

1083
03:44:06,770 --> 03:44:33,729
Come on. All right. Is it weird that I'm just gonna start hitting them in the head when I see them with bats

1084
03:44:33,729 --> 03:44:37,920
I they just may come in and do this like what am I supposed to do?

1085
03:44:37,920 --> 03:44:59,860
I need to have a bat just sitting right next to my desk clean up. We're still open

1086
03:44:59,860 --> 03:45:18,469
They're still an arcade machine that works guards will take care of them get this over here. Okay, put the table back

1087
03:45:18,569 --> 03:45:33,959
Maybe she got a new LCD. Although that thing was pretty good when I've got it though. I remember I got a decent one, right?

1088
03:45:33,959 --> 03:46:23,930
Hey, it's keyboard over here. Okay pain in the ass pain in the behind. Sorry. I'm just reading something upgrade the building

1089
03:46:23,930 --> 03:46:34,190
I don't you think I have money to upgrade the building. I have $400 to my name my cafe. Okay a fun place

1090
03:46:34,190 --> 03:46:37,579
That's good, but I have

1091
03:46:37,899 --> 03:46:45,239
$335 and you do no swears for 30 minutes. I could try it's possible

1092
03:46:45,239 --> 03:46:53,159
I could try it my cafe upgrade page new room a kitchen

1093
03:46:53,639 --> 03:46:59,090
Okay for a new room. I need 800 bucks. It's in is

1094
03:46:59,530 --> 03:47:15,420
1,400 that's not that bad actually old speakers. Oh tip box. I'm getting it. We got a lot of customers now

1095
03:47:15,540 --> 03:47:39,670
We good, but if I can't afford it out of the way, okay, I gotta move this

1096
03:47:39,670 --> 03:47:57,879
I can't I actually cannot leave right here is good. Okay right there for the desk in the back

1097
03:47:58,000 --> 03:48:06,379
This feels really weirdly high rotate your disk to aim towards the front

1098
03:48:06,379 --> 03:48:12,840
Oh, I see you mean so move that actually put the desk in a better spot. Okay

1099
03:48:12,840 --> 03:48:43,889
I don't think I can move this desk. I can't this desk is permanently here. It doesn't smell it's it's fine

1100
03:48:44,149 --> 03:48:54,200
It's a little dirty, but it's doesn't good work

1101
03:48:55,670 --> 03:49:12,479
Excellent job that guy would have got away with it to clean it up got

1102
03:49:14,760 --> 03:49:28,350
How much people tip usually is it more than a few dollars no it stinks. It's not dirty. What do you it doesn't oh shit

1103
03:49:28,350 --> 03:49:56,100
Okay, make sure you tip. Thanks. Let's go bingo more money more money more money more money

1104
03:49:56,340 --> 03:50:22,120
More money more money greedy. No, I'm keeping my prices fair. Nobody was saying dude

1105
03:50:22,120 --> 03:50:27,520
Jack your prices up like crazy, but I mean like a very expensive. I want repeat customers

1106
03:50:27,520 --> 03:50:35,870
I want good reviews you're gonna owe about five hundred dollars in a couple minutes

1107
03:50:35,870 --> 03:50:52,329
I am if I have it I couldn't run away, but high prices make people think it's worth more

1108
03:50:52,409 --> 03:51:08,420
That's actually like not is that like a crazy. That's I don't know that's so weird, but I think I've like I'm gonna do it

1109
03:51:08,420 --> 03:51:17,399
I can't change the front. I have to complete the setup first

1110
03:51:17,399 --> 03:51:25,079
Oh, it's cuz somebody's using it right now people buy iPhones. I don't even know why they still have an iPhone every year

1111
03:51:25,079 --> 03:51:30,000
I don't get it. I mean I do but I don't at the same time

1112
03:51:30,040 --> 03:51:35,159
You know I had the same exact theory about the same opinion on

1113
03:51:36,200 --> 03:51:43,250
Like the fact that they turned iPhones into like Madden games. I don't know all these companies just started releasing

1114
03:51:44,090 --> 03:51:51,260
Something every year. That's the same thing like every two years. We have to have this release

1115
03:51:51,260 --> 03:52:12,420
It's like why does the world all following the Madden formula? This is looking good. I'm thinking of buying a another

1116
03:52:15,760 --> 03:52:16,760
mmm

1117
03:52:16,760 --> 03:52:22,370
Did I get another arcade cabinet or should I buy another room? I feel like I don't need another room right now

1118
03:52:22,409 --> 03:52:27,250
I feel like I don't want another room. I won't see more people stealing stuff. I'm gonna stay small for now

1119
03:52:27,250 --> 03:52:55,370
Oh, you're done somebody else run out. You know what really solidified this to my brain

1120
03:52:56,969 --> 03:53:06,879
WWE the wrestling games they turned it into a yearly Madden game and my eyes were opened

1121
03:53:07,079 --> 03:53:16,760
Because that is the exact moment when those games started to becoming dog shit eyes

1122
03:53:17,440 --> 03:53:31,159
Just I was like that came out of the matrix. I was like holy shit very good. No gambling

1123
03:53:31,200 --> 03:53:37,030
I told you I wasn't gonna do it a new one had more time

1124
03:53:37,450 --> 03:53:46,469
Yeah, I I really hope that they learned and you know what I have said nothing nice and nothing good at all about the recent

1125
03:53:46,469 --> 03:53:51,989
WWE games or like what I think about the development of those games. I have said nothing nice

1126
03:53:51,989 --> 03:53:53,829
It's all been bad all of it

1127
03:53:53,829 --> 03:54:02,159
I will be happy if they actually took the couple three years here to make the new one and it's good if it's not good

1128
03:54:02,399 --> 03:54:06,440
If it's just as kind of bad and broken and shitty and backwards as the other ones

1129
03:54:06,479 --> 03:54:11,780
I don't even think I'm going to get it. I don't think I'm gonna you play it

1130
03:54:11,780 --> 03:54:18,360
I don't think I don't think it's gonna happen. It's been over 30 minutes. It has your rightless gamble

1131
03:54:18,659 --> 03:54:41,079
No, I'm kidding. They've been yearly since 2000. No, no, I don't think so. Well, here's the thing a

1132
03:54:41,559 --> 03:54:44,319
Bunch of companies used to make a bunch about these games

1133
03:54:44,319 --> 03:54:53,239
I don't know what happened and this pisses me off too. It was a time back before like 2008 2010

1134
03:54:53,600 --> 03:55:00,299
When more than one fucking company could make a video game based on a license, right? What happened was

1135
03:55:00,780 --> 03:55:07,540
Yeah, there'd be a WWE game or WWF game every year because like there would be three or four companies making these games

1136
03:55:07,860 --> 03:55:10,459
It'd be like three or four different studios making a WWF game

1137
03:55:10,459 --> 03:55:15,270
It would be three or four different football games three or four different baseball games

1138
03:55:15,270 --> 03:55:20,360
And now all these companies just have mega licenses that have lasted for the last 15 plus years

1139
03:55:20,559 --> 03:55:32,930
That they're just the only person that makes the game and nobody else can I was a big baseball

1140
03:55:33,209 --> 03:55:36,870
Fan back in the day baseball game fan

1141
03:55:36,870 --> 03:55:38,690
I remember MVP baseball was awesome

1142
03:55:38,690 --> 03:55:44,319
And then when they got the license taken away and they could never make a game like that ever again

1143
03:55:44,500 --> 03:55:45,780
They just said fuck it

1144
03:55:45,780 --> 03:55:53,639
We're never making a baseball game ever again and their games were so good the MVP baseball games were the best baseball games

1145
03:55:53,680 --> 03:55:56,159
No one comes close. Nobody comes even remote

1146
03:55:56,159 --> 03:56:02,479
No one comes close and they never will and they lost the license because of all the well

1147
03:56:02,479 --> 03:56:07,959
We're gonna get the exclusive baseball license to make a bunch of shitty baseball games in a row. And what's that? That's weird

1148
03:56:08,280 --> 03:56:13,100
It was 2k, right? Because it was it was the 2k baseball franchise because EA

1149
03:56:13,700 --> 03:56:15,170
Go

1150
03:56:15,170 --> 03:56:22,000
Wait a minute. Hold on. There's a fire everybody. Hold on. It was a license war, right? Well, you guys are gonna

1151
03:56:22,520 --> 03:56:31,110
Do the exclusive rights to football? We're gonna do the exclusive rights to baseball. Why is everything on fire yet? Don't sit down

1152
03:56:31,110 --> 03:56:47,319
I'm not done doing this yet. Is this still burning? What's what's burning? Something's still on fire. What is it?

1153
03:56:47,680 --> 03:57:08,979
Did I get it? Okay. Okay. So EA gets the exclusive licensing rights to Madden like forever, right and then 2k goes

1154
03:57:08,979 --> 03:57:13,780
Oh, yeah, we're gonna get exclusive rights to baseball and then make just like five terrible baseball games in a row

1155
03:57:13,780 --> 03:57:30,809
I was so mad when that happened. I was it was it was inconsolable MLB. The show is great though

1156
03:57:31,450 --> 03:57:34,209
Yeah, I know. I know the show is good

1157
03:57:43,670 --> 03:57:45,430
explainer Andy

1158
03:57:45,430 --> 03:58:10,629
That emo I he's laughing at tic-tacs again. I got tic-tacs up in the other monitor

1159
03:58:10,670 --> 03:58:20,229
I'm just laughing about him. Is it dirty? It is. All right

1160
03:58:20,229 --> 03:58:22,840
It's time to expand and turn into an arcade

1161
03:58:23,120 --> 03:58:47,120
Is it arcade time you made a comment about apples yesterday and said you didn't like honey crisp. Um, thank you

1162
03:58:47,120 --> 03:58:53,430
Good work. It's not that I don't like honey crisp. I just I don't I wouldn't buy them at the grocery store

1163
03:58:53,430 --> 03:59:09,059
I can't afford this yet. Um, maybe I'll buy another arcade cabinet. What about

1164
03:59:10,139 --> 03:59:18,120
It's not look so ugly. These are kind of cool. I like this one. Let's do this. Oh

1165
03:59:20,989 --> 03:59:22,110
Nice

1166
03:59:22,110 --> 03:59:26,770
He's about to run

1167
03:59:26,770 --> 03:59:35,719
He's going after somebody. How come you don't just go back to the old WWE game

1168
03:59:35,719 --> 03:59:41,639
So because that's a very specific question. I have a very specific answer. The old WWE games are

1169
03:59:43,639 --> 03:59:45,280
so slow

1170
03:59:45,280 --> 03:59:52,840
So slow it takes sometimes

1171
03:59:53,399 --> 04:00:00,290
10 to 20 30 plus seconds once you have too many layers on a wrestler like a creator wrestler

1172
04:00:00,690 --> 04:00:07,620
To load even moving an inch to the left some asset it was it's on PlayStation 3

1173
04:00:09,670 --> 04:00:17,049
Xbox 360 and all that shit. So it just it's on such old hardware that it just can't do it

1174
04:00:17,049 --> 04:00:23,879
It can't run I could technically do it

1175
04:00:23,879 --> 04:00:33,989
But it's just I thought he's running rabbit of the walls

1176
04:00:33,989 --> 04:00:38,110
I got new paint and now it doesn't look like we're inside of a bad public bathroom

1177
04:00:38,309 --> 04:00:49,139
You're a millionaire hire somebody to make a wrestling game for you. I think you severely

1178
04:00:49,979 --> 04:00:59,930
Underestimate how much it costs to make a 3d video game. No, no, no, no, no sit down sit down sit down

1179
04:01:00,409 --> 04:01:18,610
I'm just sitting on money sitting on my is it god. No, it's not over the console. Oh

1180
04:01:20,770 --> 04:01:22,770
It's okay, sir, I'll take care of that

1181
04:01:24,049 --> 04:01:47,559
Absolutely ridiculous that that happened. There's two free coke two free coupons to our go-kart track. Damn it get a higher somebody

1182
04:01:47,559 --> 04:01:49,000
I don't want to hire too many people

1183
04:01:49,040 --> 04:02:00,049
Or I blow all my money, I'm gonna polar bear fortnight dancing. Well

1184
04:02:01,690 --> 04:02:03,649
Actually is bringing in a lot of people

1185
04:02:03,649 --> 04:02:19,489
Way more people are coming here than were before I'm getting another arcade cabinet one of the nicer ones. What's a good one?

1186
04:02:23,379 --> 04:02:36,510
Defender let's get defender. Yeah, that's a three-star arcade machine. Nice. All right, get a trash can

1187
04:02:36,510 --> 04:02:38,510
Is that the problem? Is that why I've just been?

1188
04:02:38,750 --> 04:02:54,700
Permanently just being just sweep Andy. I broke that guy's neck an hour ago and it's still messed up. Oh, yeah

1189
04:02:55,100 --> 04:03:20,819
Um, hold on right here. Is that actually what happened? It's a gas pay. Thank you. Oh, thanks for the tip

1199
04:04:50,209 --> 04:04:57,170
Makes sense. No. No, I was just I was trying to click it right now

1200
04:04:57,969 --> 04:05:01,780
You didn't even need to do that to that guy. Well, we had it was a complete misunderstanding

1201
04:05:01,780 --> 04:05:14,500
I just had to literally just go hey, I'm I'm I've just come here the room stinks the room

04:06:58,219 --> 04:07:01,489
People said wait, can I get a heater?

1210

leaner

1220
04:08:20,309 --> 04:08:27,879
600 bucks that's so much. That's only for every three days. No, that's not worth it

1221
04:08:28,479 --> 04:08:58,020
Maybe it is maybe it is. I don't want anybody to steal that. There it is

1222
04:08:58,139 --> 04:09:05,670
Okay, so it doesn't matter where I put this put it like right up here

1223
04:09:05,670 --> 04:09:18,370
Press F to direct to adjust air conditioner temperature should I do auto air temperature adjusted automatically? Yeah

1224
04:09:18,370 --> 04:09:29,260
Okay, that's better back to clean. This is uh, yeah

1225
04:09:29,780 --> 04:09:40,979
And this is empty. I'm gonna throw all the empties over in the corner and everything I can use on the desk

1226
04:09:41,340 --> 04:09:44,920
Why is it so cold in here?

1227
04:09:44,959 --> 04:10:01,879
Didn't I just get this? Well, what are you doing? Oh shit my hitting it

1228
04:10:01,879 --> 04:10:31,860
I need another one of these now and maybe even another PC. This girl has been here for days

1229
04:10:35,799 --> 04:10:41,280
She you're right, she actually has been here for do I mean I can't what is she doing?

1230
04:10:41,760 --> 04:10:49,860
Why is she has just been squaring up for a week what's going on?

1231
04:10:50,319 --> 04:11:00,450
Okay, I was just checking to see if she was squaring me up or if you're squaring up the bouncer. What do you want?

1232
04:11:00,889 --> 04:11:12,739
What's the problem? Need a mascot back? You're right. Hold on. Let me clean right? Let me get cleaned up

1233
04:11:12,840 --> 04:11:42,579
All right, that's clean clean it up. I do it the mascots right here. Stop him. Stop him. Stop this guy. Stop this guy

1234
04:11:42,940 --> 04:11:49,899
No, all right. I'm sorry. There was a criminal in here

1235
04:11:50,139 --> 04:12:07,620
Where's the go you stole the computer out of that underneath the way the guy was sitting? I'm still not gonna buy that

1236
04:12:07,620 --> 04:12:13,729
That's not worth it the floor the floor the floor

1237
04:12:13,729 --> 04:12:19,500
I'll wait that somebody wants to that ask God's bring it in too many people. I can't even do it fire extinguisher wait

1238
04:12:19,500 --> 04:12:28,700
I'm getting overwhelmed. Hold on. I'm getting overwhelmed. Don't overwhelm me

1239
04:12:28,899 --> 04:12:35,020
We're doing research like to the length of your arm from your fingertip to your shoulder. All right

1240
04:12:36,020 --> 04:12:40,860
What how the fuck am I gonna measure that? I don't know one foot like two maybe like three feet

1241
04:12:41,219 --> 04:12:45,799
Said from the my shoulder to my fingertip around on three feet. I have no idea

1242
04:12:48,809 --> 04:12:50,809
Floor right floor floor floor floor. Oh

1243
04:12:51,860 --> 04:13:01,260
Smokey what a fucking idiot. I shouldn't I should have waited at least a second. That looks worse than the other one

1244
04:13:01,260 --> 04:13:24,379
How is that different? This looks worse. I would love to take your money. Well, this one the orangutan

1245
04:13:25,180 --> 04:13:43,870
Guy watching porn. Yeah, the people watch porn in here all the time. There's nothing

1246
04:13:43,870 --> 04:13:57,450
I can't really do much about it if I'm honest. Hey, dude, did you find those arcade machines in the river?

1247
04:13:57,969 --> 04:14:05,379
No, speaking of arcade machines. I'm gonna go for another one

1248
04:14:05,420 --> 04:14:24,950
They're just really really bananas bananas bananas strawberries. Oh

1249
04:14:27,290 --> 04:14:51,920
Yes. All right. We're good. One more beaches bananas strawberries. Okay, I'm done. I got requests get on here

1250
04:14:51,959 --> 04:15:10,280
Check on your doge coin. Good idea. Where is it? All right here crypto. How many do I have?

1251
04:15:10,379 --> 04:15:29,389
How many do I have I wanted to sell five not whatever there's no Oh fire extinguisher. Yeah, I said before eight

1252
04:15:29,430 --> 04:15:45,760
It's 830 right now. I went well past that I got the bouncer

1253
04:15:46,930 --> 04:15:51,520
I thought he was just had enough for her once and for all and was just gonna drop her

1254
04:16:20,100 --> 04:16:26,170
Got McDonald's colors in your shop

1255
04:16:26,489 --> 04:16:41,129
You can't I um speaking of McDonald's what speaking of McDonald's? I've updated my McDonald's order

1256
04:16:43,399 --> 04:16:48,700
One of my mods said he got my old McDonald's order and he said he like a diarrhea

1257
04:16:48,700 --> 04:16:55,940
I was like man, what do you what are you talking about? I think that's a shit

1258
04:16:55,940 --> 04:17:01,110
Yeah, you know, you're eating all the shareables. What are you talking about? Those of you that don't know

1259
04:17:01,110 --> 04:17:06,430
I have a crazy McDonald's order where it's like three sandwiches like nuggets and the whole point is it's a

1260
04:17:06,709 --> 04:17:12,809
Some of those items are to be shared and he said he said he was like diarrhea or something

1261
04:17:12,809 --> 04:17:13,290
So I was like, all right

1262
04:17:13,290 --> 04:17:20,360
let me update the order for you my new McDonald's order that I get almost every time now is

1263
04:17:21,799 --> 04:17:30,440
Two double cheeseburgers ten piece nugget and a powerade and those are not necessarily to be shared. Sometimes they are

1264
04:17:31,319 --> 04:17:41,250
That's a lot of money. He's like dude. I ate that McDonald's order. You were talking about man

1265
04:17:41,290 --> 04:17:46,629
I struggled to get through it. I'm like wait you ate the whole thing by yourself. What about the shareables?

1266
04:17:47,069 --> 04:17:49,069
He's like shareables. What are you talking about?

1267
04:17:49,069 --> 04:18:08,200
No, you I always order it a ten-piece nugget and maybe like an extra burger or so just for anybody that wants it

1268
04:18:08,200 --> 04:18:10,319
Just because I like wouldn't I don't know

1269
04:18:10,520 --> 04:18:15,819
But I know I come if I go to eat and people like happy and like eating and stuff

1270
04:18:15,819 --> 04:18:16,340
It's like, oh, yeah

1271
04:18:16,340 --> 04:18:21,420
I got sake a ten-piece nugget to have anybody have one if you want them because nobody wants to order nuggets

1272
04:18:21,420 --> 04:18:25,719
Right the ten-piece nugget meal and even like a five-piece nugget with a good drink

1273
04:18:26,120 --> 04:18:33,850
Never seems like enough. So I take that away from the person. I make it so they don't have to make that decision. So oh

1274
04:18:34,530 --> 04:18:43,940
Dude, I really would love nuggets. They're up where they're available man. They're just here in my opinion in my

1275
04:18:45,319 --> 04:18:48,959
Experience most people don't want to just have nuggets and fries

1276
04:18:49,399 --> 04:18:55,760
Like a five-piece nugget is an add-on to a lot of people's meals. I'm like, let me take that out of your hands

1277
04:18:55,760 --> 04:19:14,120
I got it much money. Well, hell yeah, I think it's time for another arcade cabinet

1278
04:19:14,639 --> 04:19:19,899
Last arcade cabinet is the final one after this cabinet comes in

1279
04:19:21,670 --> 04:19:29,889
I'm gonna just coast until I can buy the room upgrade. What's the best one here? This one of these is good

1280
04:19:29,889 --> 04:19:37,270
Maybe this one we have to have variety right? I'll get this one and I'll buy another steam game

1281
04:19:37,469 --> 04:19:57,559
If you like this Shrek one, alright, let's coast nice like your portfolio balancing crypto

1282
04:19:58,040 --> 04:20:12,040
Okay, portfolio dogecoin

1283
04:20:12,879 --> 04:20:15,180
Alright, how many do I have 15?

1284
04:20:15,860 --> 04:20:21,159
Sell nice I made four dollars. Actually, I made like 30 cents

1285
04:20:22,469 --> 04:20:28,229
The trash can there's no such thing as a trash can in this game

1286
04:20:28,629 --> 04:20:38,469
This is actually the last thing I can probably do before I upgrade the building. I'm running out of room

1287
04:20:38,469 --> 04:20:50,700
This is straight up 90

1288
04:20:50,899 --> 04:20:57,649
Yeah, this is 90 bucks. I'd say every pretty much every hour

1289
04:20:58,170 --> 04:21:09,739
We got 90 bucks here in the arcade cabinets. The next thing I promise the next thing I do will be

1290
04:21:10,620 --> 04:21:16,590
A cleaning upgrade update the floor. I already did. It's a different floor. Just looks like shit. I'm sorry

1291
04:21:17,030 --> 04:21:26,610
Holy shit. I haven't saved the game in a long time. You're right

1292
04:21:27,229 --> 04:21:56,500
You are right. If it's the same floor, then why did it cost $200 to put down here? Where's the rest of this dirt?

1293
04:21:57,000 --> 04:22:06,659
Don't get scared. He ran off

1294
04:22:18,899 --> 04:22:39,090
Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry that there was a guy that ran in here

1295
04:22:39,209 --> 04:22:47,940
The arcade machine is nice and clean ready for you. Maybe I should get a better PC now. No stick to the plan

1296
04:23:03,260 --> 04:23:09,809
Customers running away without paying is reduced. You may ask for extra time. What else we got?

1297
04:23:10,270 --> 04:23:13,750
You're known around because of your old history and thieves don't come to your shop much

1298
04:23:17,010 --> 04:23:22,030
Stamina, what else we have? Let me see if it's all the way down. I don't really care that much about this

1299
04:23:22,750 --> 04:23:28,049
stamina boxing

1300
04:23:28,450 --> 04:23:30,129
I have the bouncer

1301
04:23:30,129 --> 04:23:35,920
Body what's all the way at least don't suspect you and I had all the physical stuff. I don't really care about

1302
04:23:38,459 --> 04:23:57,600
Put it down put it down put it down put it down. Where's the extinguisher? Hey

1303
04:23:57,940 --> 04:24:12,579
Alright, um, I think I'm just gonna keep doing the cafe stuff. That feels like the best idea this one

1304
04:24:13,500 --> 04:24:16,360
extra time

1305
04:24:16,360 --> 04:24:29,680
Tipbox people leave more money in the tip box. Oh, yeah. Nice. That's good up rushing

1306
04:24:29,680 --> 04:24:44,649
I do need to say alright, so I gotta close close up the shop. Well, I've seen people wishing for a crash

1307
04:24:45,110 --> 04:24:48,569
Yeah, we're officially closed

1308
04:24:48,569 --> 04:25:01,860
Save the game

1309
04:25:02,219 --> 04:25:04,219
It's out of context I

1310
04:25:05,379 --> 04:25:15,709
Can't I don't want to alt-tab right now, but on the auto context where it's something funny. All right, get him

1311
04:25:15,829 --> 04:25:35,280
We're closed. I don't think about it close it up. Now. How do I tell them to go home?

1312
04:25:35,799 --> 04:25:43,229
Really just stay and protect this place. Most people have said your store is the same as it was hours ago

1313
04:25:43,229 --> 04:25:50,159
You're better than this. I I think it's changed pretty drastically. I've got three arcade cabinets

1314
04:25:50,159 --> 04:25:55,750
I'm about to do a second floor or a second. Um, second room. That's the next thing we're doing

1315
04:25:56,190 --> 04:26:27,819
Yeah, yeah, I tried to punch the pan in the face. Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah go back and finish the job

1316
04:26:27,819 --> 04:26:38,280
I'm good. Priority is to get a new room. We're gonna have an arcade

1317
04:26:39,020 --> 04:26:44,379
Cabinet room besides the arcade cabinet room is gonna be a console room or like the yeah

1318
04:26:44,379 --> 04:26:47,290
We're gonna set we're gonna split it up. I got a plan. Don't worry

1319
04:26:47,290 --> 04:27:06,159
At least I hope I do you can go to the club now. I can go to the club. You're right

1320
04:27:06,760 --> 04:27:53,299
Is it us? Is it us? There's slot machines in there. Oh nice. I'm to get a second room. Okay. Hmm

1321
04:27:53,860 --> 04:28:06,270
Did I do now I'm gonna do this first. I have enough to buy it. I got 900 bucks my cafe new room

1322
04:28:06,270 --> 04:28:18,059
I officially have a new room. Is it just here? It's just it made them. This is made a little longer

1323
04:28:22,799 --> 04:28:36,010
Well, I guess I'll put these back here. All right, it's we're closed these two are going in the back

1324
04:28:36,090 --> 04:28:47,760
That's the easiest way to do it. Hey, they should be able to fit back to back, right?

1325
04:28:47,799 --> 04:29:10,040
I'm gonna put this up here right in the middle auto adjust. Please get a new chair. Yeah, I have this

1326
04:29:10,040 --> 04:29:15,010
I do have this plastic lawn chair. You're right. I'll do that in a second, too

1327
04:29:15,010 --> 04:29:41,879
I'll take you that's much better that wait. Is that the wrong way?

1328
04:29:41,879 --> 04:29:44,889
It's a huge improvement

1329
04:29:44,889 --> 04:29:48,290
It really is but just I took me so long to be able to comfortably pay $800

1330
04:29:48,290 --> 04:29:53,540
And maybe some if you if you're new to the channel

1331
04:29:55,100 --> 04:29:58,059
one of the things you have to kind of keep in mind is if

1332
04:29:58,700 --> 04:30:05,299
If it takes an hour to do something in a game, you need to add in brackets like two hours

1333
04:30:05,379 --> 04:30:11,340
So it takes three hours. I get to do I get so distracted

1334
04:30:11,459 --> 04:30:17,059
I'm like the most distractible person probably in the world

1335
04:30:21,899 --> 04:30:23,899
let's get another chair and

1336
04:30:23,940 --> 04:30:34,450
Get two more chairs. So we'll all let's have these with those. That's I got enough money, right? I think no

1337
04:30:34,450 --> 04:30:48,040
I don't I don't have any money. Let's do it later bombs

1338
04:30:48,200 --> 04:31:12,180
Am I ever gonna see a return on this ever? That's a huge improvement though. It really is. Wait, what'd you say?

1339
04:31:13,649 --> 04:31:18,309
XQC spent two full hours gambling until he had zero without ever setting up his cafe, and then he quit the game

1340
04:31:18,309 --> 04:31:26,290
Oh

1341
04:31:27,959 --> 04:31:31,600
My streamer

1342
04:31:32,000 --> 04:32:02,159
Alright, let's go clean up. I gotta buy a different mouse. This just looks like a bar of dirty soap. That's good

1343
04:32:02,159 --> 04:32:09,739
I need a second chair. This is ugly. It needs to be changed. How about just like right here like along this wall

1344
04:32:09,840 --> 04:32:28,879
This gives fun. Oh, what's wrong?

1345
04:32:36,450 --> 04:32:53,860
Why can I put this here far? Yeah, I need a lamp. I mean the light the light the light. Oh, oh

1346
04:32:55,680 --> 04:33:08,599
All right, how come you're creating an arcade in a crack den? I don't know it's fun

1347
04:33:08,599 --> 04:33:28,630
Hey, I think I'm ready to open the place. I have enough we can just coast for a little bit

1348
04:33:28,630 --> 04:33:42,740
I only I don't have any money electricity needs to be it's on right? Yep. All right back in business. Let's go

1349
04:33:42,779 --> 04:33:56,279
This is kind of nice. Look at three or four more arcade cabinets down here upgraded

1350
04:33:56,279 --> 04:34:02,080
Maybe get a kitchen eventually here in the next like half hour. Probably get a new floor. It's clean

1351
04:34:02,200 --> 04:34:19,560
It smells good in here. I think it does this empty. No, it's a more light. So it looks bigger

1352
04:34:20,000 --> 04:34:29,409
What do these other let me see what they look like? I haven't paid my bills in like a month

1353
04:34:46,810 --> 04:34:58,180
Street audio, I don't know. I don't know. What do you mean? We're fine

1354
04:34:58,180 --> 04:35:03,000
We get you have $40 to your name right now, but I have a

1355
04:35:04,939 --> 04:35:25,380
Income stream here. That's about to probably get pretty good. Wait new quest. Do there's a big fight

1356
04:35:25,380 --> 04:35:48,779
Can you bring me three baseball bats? I'm just gonna buy them. Is that okay? Thanks

1357
04:35:48,939 --> 04:35:58,639
Okay, do I have enough to buy three bats because I probably get some money from this. It's forty four eight

1358
04:35:58,639 --> 04:36:16,040
Okay, one more person leaving and I should be good to go. I'm gonna read the reviews. Oh good idea the

1421
04:51:40,060 --> 04:51:48,229
When they go out, I don't have to do anything. It's awesome. I don't have to worry about it

1441
04:55:20,180 --> 04:55:25,240
Slots can actually get you a bonus. That's worth several thousand dollars. It's actually not bad to do it

1442
04:55:25,700 --> 04:55:54,009
Yeah, you got to hit it though. You actually have to hit it save and then gamble. No, I got a plan

1443
04:55:54,009 --> 04:55:57,009
I we talked about it already. I already know what I want

1444
04:55:57,009 --> 04:56:12,400
Just gamble on fruit slots with a really low bet and just do it a bunch because the bonus can pay a lot

1445
04:56:15,630 --> 04:56:17,389
I have a tuber voice right now

1446
04:56:17,389 --> 04:56:21,220
Yeah, all right. What you just did is you just told you just did the manual breathing thing to me

1447
04:56:21,740 --> 04:56:28,250
Like hey, dude, you're manually breathing. It's just a god. Damn it. Am I shit?

1448
04:56:30,650 --> 04:56:48,869
By gambling upgrades you just did that to 18,000 people not what I'm just saying

1449
04:56:49,349 --> 04:56:54,619
Saying that to me is the equivalent of the manual breathing thing

1450
04:56:54,619 --> 04:57:10,500
I think you guys had it wrong cuz listen I can hear air coming up. I think this is on

1453
04:57:56,119 --> 04:58:24,220
I think I I don't know what this is, but maybe I'll get it back with the thermometer. Yeah, where is the thermometer?

1454
04:58:24,220 --> 04:58:57,340
It's finally on from 15 to 17 Celsius. Finally, you know speaker is how much are they or 90?

1455
04:58:57,340 --> 04:59:05,919

1456
04:59:06,200 --> 04:59:23,909
Can I give it to him one sec? Yeah the fucking way. Where is he there? I hand this in. Yeah, you're right

1457
04:59:23,909 --> 04:59:36,009
I gotta have to be able to carry three. Oh

1459
04:59:58,419 --> 05:00:45,099
Yeah, it's definitely stinks in here. 17 is not freezing. Yeah freezing is zero one. Good stop. Thank you

1460
05:00:47,419 --> 05:00:58,979
Yeah, thank you. How much is backpack be 21 or 22? Okay, I'll do 22

1461
05:00:58,979 --> 05:01:14,060
I like it a little warm. I activate this guy's computer and then go get a backpack. I turn it off

1462
05:01:14,060 --> 05:01:31,380
I see this one star up there. Can you get more than one star?

1463
05:01:31,419 --> 05:01:42,169
But it did can the can you get like a chase by the police and everything? I keep seeing one star

1464
05:01:42,169 --> 05:01:54,169
All right backpack or 75,000. I don't have that much money. I get this one. All right build

1465
05:01:56,700 --> 05:02:23,680
Am I doing what do I put this? Oh, okay. Very cool. I do anything else in the cafe list probably this one

1466
05:02:23,680 --> 05:02:40,529
I mean, I might as well just buy it. All right, how do I get one more point?

1467
05:02:40,569 --> 05:02:56,240
I just punch somebody didn't get a point. What's the point if you have a bouncer? That's a good. Yeah, that's true

1468
05:03:04,669 --> 05:03:26,659
Exactly. See what's the point? What if what's the very very end of like the cafe list your knowledge of mining equipment is increased

1469
05:03:26,659 --> 05:03:29,540
You can now buy more mining devices and then sometimes in the casino

1470
05:03:29,540 --> 05:03:39,900
You have the possibility of getting back the bet you lost that's actually huge. I'll get this one. I

1471
05:03:40,700 --> 05:03:57,009
Could get extra luck in gambling. Are you serious? I need the point. Yeah, I'll get that's true

1472
05:03:57,009 --> 05:04:11,250
but I just bought the backpack, so what has more priority door or

1473
05:04:13,450 --> 05:04:20,959
Point of sale I'm gonna say point of sale this door really that much more important. I have a

1474
05:04:21,540 --> 05:04:39,330
Bouncer. Yeah point of sale is way more important. The bouncer is just roundhouse kicking people in the fucking head and we're good

1475
05:04:39,330 --> 05:04:43,020
I think we're good. I think we're good

1476
05:04:43,500 --> 05:04:49,630
The only thing I have to worry about is the is the people that run it and just throw like an explosion in here

1477
05:04:49,729 --> 05:04:57,549
Yeah, get the Pete get yeah, I'm getting point of sale. So I cuz I'm so bad and so ADHD about actually

1478
05:04:58,110 --> 05:05:00,419
Taking money from people and stuff. So, oh

1479
05:05:03,540 --> 05:05:39,500
Okay, that's uh, should be good. How do I use this? What can I do this with?

1480
05:05:40,020 --> 05:05:46,790
Fun place. I like cold places. I like it cold even the owner of this place is he open. Yeah, whatever. It's cold

1481
05:05:46,790 --> 05:05:51,639
It's cold. It's cold. It's cold. It's cold. Nothing to do about it. It's for the Bitcoin stuff

1482
05:05:51,639 --> 05:06:02,619
Oh, you see I need the point of sale so bad. He's gonna get kicked in the head and that's not even his fault door idiot

1483
05:06:03,619 --> 05:06:10,369
I'm going to try I have to pick it

1484
05:06:10,849 --> 05:06:27,909
The door is 1200 I'm getting point of sale right now. Where is it insufficient?

1485
05:06:27,909 --> 05:06:37,159
Why that I just had enough I want to say we'll get you more money. Yeah, I keep missing it

1486
05:06:37,159 --> 05:06:49,509
Oh, maybe I will just say for the door. I think

1487
05:06:50,209 --> 05:06:59,979
Door friends I think are out out voting the piece of shit friends. You play Nancy Drew ever again

1488
05:06:59,979 --> 05:07:10,369
No, I can't I'm not gonna say I'm gonna deny ever playing Nancy Drew ever again. Why wouldn't I it's pretty fun

1489
05:07:10,650 --> 05:07:22,659
Would you say is it unreasonable to make my Mayo have a little bit of crunch?

1490
05:07:23,099 --> 05:07:28,799
No, man, whatever people dip their french fries in Mayo. I said it's an English thing, right?

1491
05:07:29,319 --> 05:07:36,229
Almost there almost time for the door

1492
05:07:39,169 --> 05:07:48,130
Nasty really my point of sale. I don't I'm not even collecting people's money

1493
05:07:48,130 --> 05:07:53,889
My point of sale is the bottom of my bouncer's shoe. I feel like that's

1494
05:07:54,409 --> 05:08:02,000
That's kind of fucked up. I feel like crunchy Mayo actually would be kind of good

1495
05:08:02,400 --> 05:08:14,240
Okay, this crunchy peanut butter what if there was crunchy Mayo, how would that even work? Is that disgusting? That's too far

1496
05:08:14,680 --> 05:08:22,069
That's yeah, that's a little gross. You're right. It's eggshells. Oh

1497
05:08:22,709 --> 05:08:35,439
What the fuck you want more time? No, you good. I could go for an egg salad sandwich right now

1498
05:08:35,959 --> 05:08:42,020

1499
05:08:42,619 --> 05:08:56,150
Fresh egg salad sandwich is is up there pretty high with everything else spicy mayo is good

1500
05:08:56,590 --> 05:09:08,189
Will you hurry up and get off the computer and see again now she's gonna get kicked

1501
05:09:17,750 --> 05:09:26,340
People's reviews they would start to write this hey make sure you give the guy the counter a little bit more time because

1502
05:09:27,220 --> 05:09:32,619
If you don't if you leave without paying cuz he won't take your money you get your ass kicked outside

1503
05:09:38,560 --> 05:09:45,209
Almost there. I'll have it tomorrow

Yeah, say good night to the panda. I did didn't I good night. I tell doors number one priority

1509
05:11:21,790 --> 05:11:37,450
I really shouldn't have even got the backpack. It was 500 bucks that I didn't need to spend us to ha ha ha

1510
05:11:37,450 --> 05:11:39,450
That was a cool relatable streamer

1511
05:11:39,650 --> 05:11:44,959
Yeah, I know I know isn't very good

1512
05:11:45,119 --> 05:12:00,080
Complete the bat quest with the backpack can I though I guess I could hold one in my hand and then two

1513
05:12:00,319 --> 05:12:16,310
Wait, let me do that now then. Oh, I can you're right. All right. No, I'm corrected

1514
05:12:16,310 --> 05:12:46,009
You're right one more bat right over here somewhere. Nice. All right, I get money for this

1515
05:12:46,250 --> 05:12:51,639
That'd be great because then I can put the door in immediately and I'm sorry, but I don't have money to give you right now

1516
05:12:51,639 --> 05:12:55,110
But don't worry. I'll make it up dude

1517
05:12:55,110 --> 05:12:57,790
There's an internet cafe owner in the city who doesn't listen to my word

1518
05:12:58,310 --> 05:13:03,189
Everyone in this city listens to my word what I'm asking you to do is place this bugging device under his desk

1519
05:13:03,310 --> 05:13:06,479
It's located on the second floor of the building where you live

1520
05:13:06,759 --> 05:13:28,029
It's the bug behind the rival internet cafe table. Oh wait. It's where I live is a rival internet cafe

1521
05:13:28,029 --> 05:13:39,119
I'm gonna need one of these so this is what this is what the second floor is then okay

1522
05:13:39,119 --> 05:13:58,349
I'm gonna play VR chat together. I want to show you my spongebob avatar

1523
05:13:58,630 --> 05:14:06,680
Um, I don't really I don't really do VR too much one hour for free. Let's see what you are. This is your little

1524
05:14:10,200 --> 05:14:17,560
Nice, would you get those computers from? Hey, those the computers they still use at the bank by the way. Hi, jerma985 here

1525
05:14:17,560 --> 05:14:32,080
I run a different uh operating business down the street. How are you? Did I miss or can I not?

1526
05:14:35,169 --> 05:14:42,099
Smash it up. I don't think I can do oh wait. You got all this over here. Hey

1527
05:14:44,430 --> 05:15:11,639
All right, I bugged it his floor sucks way worse than mine. Why are you guys talking so much shit? Where's that guy?

1528
05:15:11,759 --> 05:15:45,380
There you are 400 bucks. Hell. Yeah, I was worth it. It's time for a door. Let's go you play monster hunter rise

1529
05:15:45,700 --> 05:15:46,759
Nah, I don't think so

1530
05:15:46,759 --> 05:15:53,790
I played a shitload of monster hunter world and finished the game

1531
05:15:53,790 --> 05:15:58,650
I beat the game and I kind of did a little bit of the extra stuff and kind of kept going but

1532
05:15:58,849 --> 05:16:10,639
Mmm, I got my fellow monster monster hunter. It's fun. What's the best iPad game?

1533
05:16:10,680 --> 05:16:16,250
The room series and if you've never played it before let me just you got so much to work with

1534
05:16:16,450 --> 05:16:21,400
They have like five games in the series and they're all so much fun. It's just like a relaxing

1535
05:16:22,200 --> 05:16:29,299
Tinkering puzzle game get the room get the whole series. That's by far the best iPad game

1536
05:16:29,299 --> 05:16:41,409
Just to play in bed for sure. All right door automatic sliding door. It's glorious looking

1537
05:16:43,840 --> 05:17:08,540
Finally nice this fall. I'll do 20 22. What about the Outer Wilds DLC?

1538
05:17:08,740 --> 05:17:19,200
Mmm, probably not. Why would this even light on fire? No one's even using it. Outer Wilds was fun

1539
05:17:19,639 --> 05:17:23,200
But oh no, this is a disaster

1540
05:17:23,840 --> 05:17:27,220
Thank God I had just enough I gotta go now and get another one

1541
05:17:27,500 --> 05:17:38,279
Outer Wilds was a fun game, but the problem with it was I've heard the DLC is really not necessarily confusing but

1542
05:17:39,549 --> 05:17:47,080
Very specific and it could take a lot of time. I probably don't think I'll be into it. That game was really cool

1543
05:17:47,240 --> 05:17:57,669
I just not sure I'd be able to do the DLC very well. It's very cryptic. Yeah, we don't do high functioning brain

1544
05:17:58,189 --> 05:18:08,340
Games on this stream very often. I'm just so distractible. I'm so all over the place. All right, that's another one of these

1545
05:18:08,860 --> 05:18:21,840
Okay, next step is the point of sale and then after that is the kitchen the temperature. Yeah good idea play it off stream

1546
05:18:21,840 --> 05:18:42,590
Yeah, I probably will a little warm money. Oh, right ceiling. I bet I do. I don't have enough money for it

1547
05:18:43,229 --> 05:18:54,580
All right, seems pretty good chair is actually no no chair. You're right. I need a chair

1548
05:18:54,580 --> 05:19:05,439
Is the room both trapped over here? You just opened at 6 p.m. Yeah, it's a night place

1549
05:19:05,439 --> 05:19:08,759
We that's the people that can come hang out and have drinks and shit, man

1550
05:19:08,759 --> 05:19:26,369
Come on in the meantime, I'm definitely gonna play some of these little casino games. All right games, which is my favorite one

1551
05:19:26,369 --> 05:19:36,909

1552
05:19:37,029 --> 05:20:02,009

1553
05:20:02,009 --> 05:20:20,549
Let's go right down the middle. Give me all that shit. Nice right here. Somebody said this one is actually free money

1554
05:20:20,590 --> 05:20:48,840
There's blackjack. Hold on. You know, is there blackjack where this blackjack in the club? What?

1555
05:20:59,520 --> 05:21:12,580

1557

That's so bad. And then whatever who's playing the fucking piano. That's not coming from me

1558
05:21:35,479 --> 05:21:59,990
You need to upgrade the gambling. That's yeah, I'll have it by the time I go to the club. Maybe not

1559
05:22:00,310 --> 05:22:09,220
No, I won't you buy a hookah. Um, that's a good question. I don't know

1560
05:22:09,740 --> 05:22:44,500
500 bucks I want at least 500 bucks for the casino. All right, I caved kind of sounds like a I just keep falling

1562
05:23:08,750 --> 05:23:33,169
I'll take care of it. All right, wait, think I pay, you know, that's it

1563
05:23:33,169 --> 05:23:39,000
I wish I could buy an automatic air freshener. That'd be great. Should we gonna change songs?

1564
05:23:39,000 --> 05:23:51,599
I know it's kind of reminds me of every song on tik-tok

1565
05:23:55,959 --> 05:24:31,180
So then you know awful just pick up I'm gonna leave it on a little warm in here. This one's kind of scary

1566
05:24:31,380 --> 05:25:00,889
Yeah, or oh nice a seven dollar tip. Nice. Thanks, man. There's 70 cents. No seven bucks

1567

1568
05:25:13,779 --> 05:25:16,180

1574
05:26:40,200 --> 05:27:00,259

1581
05:28:21,009 --> 05:28:23,500
Oh

I have to know electricity

1589
05:30:11,979 --> 05:30:21,680
The reason why I keep punching every single one of these these guys is because they keep like bombing the cafe

05:30:21,799 --> 05:30:40,470
So I just I am it's punch on sight. It's the way it is. There was blackjack in there. Where was it?

1633
05:40:36,159 --> 05:40:47,470

1634
05:40:47,790 --> 05:40:50,020
Uh

1635
05:40:50,020 --> 05:40:59,630

All right. We're good. That's pretty good

1638
05:41:06,340 --> 05:41:08,000

1643
05:41:52,180 --> 05:42:00,380
That is

1644
05:42:00,380 --> 05:42:05,669
Absolute horse shit. You all know it but do you like it's blackjack on that hand?

1645
05:42:06,959 --> 05:42:11,380
Not ever never never and you stand on 15

1646
05:42:12,279 --> 05:42:16,529
You stand on against a five like that. I'm coming back

1647
05:42:17,209 --> 05:42:28,959
Bingo done. It's all right. I checked. Oh, fuck you

1648
05:42:30,580 --> 05:42:39,259
Fuck all of you. Not you guys these guys with suits on I got so screwed. That's you all know it

1649
05:42:39,720 --> 05:42:44,790
Just give me the safe. I got absolutely decimated

1650
05:42:45,470 --> 05:42:51,830
That blackjack dealer blackjack such bullshit dealer should even be allowed to get blackjack in this game

1651
05:42:55,709 --> 05:42:59,349
That's so dumb. Give me a break. No, I'm not done

1652
05:43:04,099 --> 05:43:17,409
Seventeen versus twenty give me a break. I can turn this around

1653
05:43:17,770 --> 05:43:32,529
13 over 7 get the free card. There it is 20. All right climbing back. Let's go for a 50 here at 9 bullshit

1654
05:43:32,529 --> 05:43:37,299
We're gonna you get that you're gonna be 19. It's gonna be draw. Great. All right again do it again

1655
05:43:39,799 --> 05:43:43,919
16 stay against a 5 don't ever hit this. That's exactly why I

1656
05:43:44,319 --> 05:43:53,729
Would have just taken that card and I would have busted. Do you get it 100 bucks? Oh, please. Oh my god

1657
05:43:53,729 --> 05:44:04,819
Oh my god, what is this table? I think they got shit face dealing. Of course he is

1658
05:44:06,040 --> 05:44:20,979
Right. Oh my god. I just like angrily almost just like punched you. I'll be back and I'm getting my revenge

1659
05:44:21,299 --> 05:44:26,860
I'm gonna get my monetary revenge. Let me make that very clear to the three of you monetary revenge

1660
05:44:26,860 --> 05:44:29,099
I'm gonna come back and make money. I'm not gonna hurt anybody

1661
05:44:30,400 --> 05:44:31,840
monetary revenge

1662
05:44:31,840 --> 05:44:44,080
That thousand dollar bet that was a big that was a big bet too

1663
05:44:45,729 --> 05:44:51,869
Anything other than 20 I had 18 if anything other than 21, of course the dealer hits blackjack on that hand

1664
05:44:52,029 --> 05:44:57,500
It didn't happen any other time that sucks. That's so annoying

1665
05:44:58,459 --> 05:45:20,630
Man, it's the Mafia City guy. Yeah, I will be back there with another 500 bucks. It's always a possibility

1666
05:45:20,630 --> 05:45:21,709
That's why you don't go all-in

1667
05:45:21,709 --> 05:45:25,580
Well, you go all-in every single time and you just win three hands and you never play ever again

1668
05:45:25,779 --> 05:45:41,709
Come on in you do a 500 all hand you win 500 bucks

1669
05:45:41,709 --> 05:45:44,590
You do a thousand dollar hand you win a thousand bucks. You do a two thousand dollar hand

1670
05:45:44,590 --> 05:45:49,959
You win four thousand dollars you just and then you get up and fucking leave and then you do and then you start you then

1671
05:45:49,959 --> 05:45:55,659
You go to like those machines that you can do literally one penny for the middle line

1672
05:45:55,959 --> 05:46:02,520
And you just spend those for an hour just drink booze. You just did you sit there for like four hours and do that

1673
05:46:03,540 --> 05:46:22,619
Don't take this advice by the way. No, absolutely do not in fact get don't ever gamble unless it's like unless you just don't give a shit

1674
05:46:22,619 --> 05:46:31,060
Right gambling is always a lose scenario. No matter what even if you win

1675
05:46:31,139 --> 05:46:37,240
It's always a lose scenario gambling is entertainment and if it's treated like anything else

1676
05:46:37,619 --> 05:46:49,139
It's not gonna happen if you are comfortable and you're in a financial position

1677
05:46:49,700 --> 05:46:52,819
To go blow three or four hundred dollars at a casino

1678
05:46:52,959 --> 05:46:55,540
Okay, right

1679
05:46:55,540 --> 05:47:01,380
but if you go to a casino and you take a thousand bucks there or a hundred bucks five hundred bucks and you're like man I

1680
05:47:01,779 --> 05:47:04,419
Can't wait to sit down and make two grand duck. Nope

1681
05:47:04,700 --> 05:47:11,520
Don't ever say that you are gonna lose every single time when you walk in the door

1682
05:47:11,520 --> 05:47:14,680
Pretend that your money just turned into Monopoly money because it doesn't exist anymore

1683
05:47:15,040 --> 05:47:21,799
You bring a certain amount of money into the casino that turns into Monopoly money, and that's it

1684
05:47:21,959 --> 05:47:31,650
This is why I lost ten thousand dollars. I

1685
05:47:32,650 --> 05:47:35,130
Did not lose ten thousand dollars at a casino

1686
05:47:35,849 --> 05:47:39,290
Always put a limit on how much you know, but yeah exactly it can be fun

1687
05:47:39,770 --> 05:47:41,130
Just don't go overboard

1688
05:47:41,130 --> 05:47:47,520
As long as you know exactly what you're willing to kind of play with and just hang out with

1689
05:47:47,919 --> 05:47:52,770
I've had a lot of good times just kind of sitting around a blackjack table

1690
05:47:52,770 --> 05:48:03,680
Just doing you know playing five to ten thousand dollar hands. You know, I mean, I've never done I'm kidding fucking Jesus Christ

1691
05:48:09,220 --> 05:48:14,020
Please don't think that serious. I'm I'm actually kidding. I'm not please

1692
05:48:17,470 --> 05:48:22,520
Stop people sweating. What do you want me to do?

1693
05:48:23,000 --> 05:48:33,270
Yeah, it's the best practice you can do is if you're gonna spend if you're gonna spend

1694
05:48:34,799 --> 05:48:36,500
$100 $50

1695
05:48:36,500 --> 05:48:43,590
Wait, he's be he's trapped. Why is he trapped? He's trying to go after somebody what happened? Why is he trapped?

1696
05:48:45,659 --> 05:48:53,919
What did you just do that to just do this with animal did a cat steal money out of the register?

1697
05:48:53,919 --> 05:49:07,900
What was that also play games out of slow too? You don't want to don't play games that take a second

1698
05:49:08,340 --> 05:49:19,950
roulette's fun because you can do really kind of low bets and roulette takes a while for it to happen and

1699
05:49:20,590 --> 05:49:33,919
Roulette is just throwing coins in the air and like who cares right need more of this

1700
05:49:39,900 --> 05:49:48,909
Blackjack is a bit blackjack is one of the best games with the least house edge and what the house edge means is that's ever

1701
05:49:48,950 --> 05:49:55,049
It's a it's a percentage right and it's based on for every hundred dollars that comes into the casino a certain percentage is

1702
05:49:55,349 --> 05:50:02,090
Guaranteed to go back to the house stuff like blackjack only has I think like less than a 5% house edge

1703
05:50:02,750 --> 05:50:08,569
slot machines have

1704
05:50:08,930 --> 05:50:13,130
Anywhere between like a 10 to 24 percent or so house edge, right?

1705
05:50:13,130 --> 05:50:19,569
So that just means that it's guaranteed that for every hundred dollars or for every dollar that comes in

1706
05:50:20,290 --> 05:50:26,580
24 cents is always gonna be lost at the casino now. That's over time right that's over a long period of time and

1707
05:50:29,430 --> 05:50:32,830
Over a year sure if somebody could hit a million dollar jackpot

1708
05:50:32,950 --> 05:50:41,290
But four million dollars came into the casino right over the course of a day or a week or a month or something

1709
05:50:44,380 --> 05:50:47,099
You're always out to lose is what I'm saying like they're

1710
05:50:47,700 --> 05:50:58,349
The casino likes it when you win because that means you're gonna play more and I'll tell you the itch hits you

1711
05:50:58,990 --> 05:51:02,090
Especially kick that guy in the head the itch hits you

1712
05:51:02,669 --> 05:51:08,639
Especially especially when if you go to a casino and you're with a bunch of friends and you're hanging out

1713
05:51:08,639 --> 05:51:13,799
You're having a good time and you hit on a slot machine or something within the first 10 seconds

1714
05:51:13,799 --> 05:51:16,840
Are you getting there right you walk in? Oh, this is great

1715
05:51:16,840 --> 05:51:21,959
I guess I'll play this one and you've been there for 10 minutes and you hit like a hundred and fifty dollars on the machine

1716
05:51:25,689 --> 05:51:29,090
It's like holy shit, this is fucking amazing. This is awesome. This is so much money, right?

1717
05:51:31,779 --> 05:51:36,479
Are you just gonna leave are you all right? That's it guys

1718
05:51:36,639 --> 05:51:41,520
We plan we plan on having a night out for like at least the next four to six hours. I'm gonna go home

1719
05:51:41,520 --> 05:51:48,889
I'm going back to my hotel room. No people stick around you hang out. You stay you're not just gonna leave

1720
05:51:49,369 --> 05:51:54,880
So you just have to make sure you pace yourself

1721
05:51:55,400 --> 05:51:57,799
Don't go crazy. Don't spend more than you want to lose

1722
05:51:58,319 --> 05:52:04,529
But you're gonna play right as long as that's what you look people go to the casino

1723
05:52:04,529 --> 05:52:10,759
And they don't have any intention of gambling. They just watch their fucking idiot friends lose all their money, right? You can be that guy

1724
05:52:11,400 --> 05:52:15,680
You can walk around with with the beer in your hand or like the glass of wine or the cocktail and just be like oh

1725
05:52:15,680 --> 05:52:19,639
So hey, how you doing? Oh you down 80 bucks. Oh

1726
05:52:20,639 --> 05:52:24,490
This was eight bucks, and I'm just gonna sip it for the next hour

1727
05:52:25,009 --> 05:52:36,720
Back to blackjack. What do you think I'm doing? I'm building up a bankroll. I'm gonna do a thousand dollar

1728
05:52:36,720 --> 05:52:45,060
No, I'm not I want to stop shilling for the casino suits. I'm not shilling for a casino

1729
05:52:45,060 --> 05:52:54,310
I'm telling you how it is. Oh the point of sale exactly

1730
05:52:54,669 --> 05:53:17,790
The call all right now I can literally just leave you live in Las Vegas, and you're not shilling for the casinos

1731
05:53:17,790 --> 05:53:20,310
I mean I Vegas is awesome. I love it here. I

1732
05:53:22,880 --> 05:53:27,479
Realistically if you want to want me to be transparent with you here, I realistically probably go to the casino

1733
05:53:27,479 --> 05:53:32,419
I mean, maybe maybe three or four times a year

1734
05:53:32,979 --> 05:53:41,680
It's usually when there's an event happening somebody's coming in a friend a group of friends, right? The group of friends come in

1735
05:53:42,159 --> 05:53:44,869
Hey, we're coming and we'll be in Vegas for three or four days

1736

1738
05:54:03,259 --> 05:54:08,169

05:54:08,169 --> 05:54:27,650
Who keeps who what vandal keeps knocking this off fun place?

1740
05:54:27,650 --> 05:54:35,270
I feel like this is a chat message

1741

Don't you the squid game person where please please play fruit slots?

1742

I will ban you for a week from this channel if this doesn't work are we all agreeing with that

1752
05:55:59,689 --> 05:56:06,950
It's got to be permanent. Oh shit. That's a lot

1753
05:56:08,979 --> 05:56:15,189
Permanent ban did they agree to that I don't know that's like sad though. I don't know if I want to do that

1754
05:56:15,189 --> 05:56:19,119
So I kind of sad so I need a thousand dollars

1755
05:56:19,479 --> 05:56:28,709
You just agreed to a permanent ban if this doesn't work out

1756
05:56:29,189 --> 05:56:32,509
They've been following since

1757
05:56:32,509 --> 05:56:40,599

This doesn't work. He's just that confident though. Just wants to be set free from this place

1761
05:57:17,860 --> 05:57:25,860
Two weeks is like one stream

1762
05:57:26,459 --> 05:57:33,159
That's so funny

1763
05:57:33,680 --> 05:57:38,840
No, I've been streaming two days a week. I've upped it. I'm not just doing once a week anymore

I'm streaming twice a week now usually like Wednesday and Sunday Wednesday and Sunday Wednesday and Sunday. Come on. Come on

We're all right. We got to get to a thousand bucks. Oh

1766
05:58:00,209 --> 05:58:02,169
This is important though

1767
05:58:02,169 --> 05:58:14,279
What's the amount of money that they're expecting? I'm gonna make if they win they need to be VIP'd

1768
05:58:17,700 --> 05:58:24,529
Hmm

1769
05:58:25,290 --> 05:58:30,099
Okay

1770
05:58:30,099 --> 05:58:37,119
Hmm. Let me think about that. All right, fine. You get VIP for two weeks if you win

1771
05:58:37,400 --> 05:58:38,959
Well, what's the amount of money?

1772
05:58:38,959 --> 05:58:45,860
We need to have it really clear because if I have to spin a hundred times at ten dollars and you're certain of this

1773
05:58:46,040 --> 05:58:50,650
What what amount because I could just keep going right? So what amount do I have to stop?

1774
05:58:50,650 --> 05:59:01,439
What amount are you expecting me to hit like in profit from a thousand dollars? So I start with a thousand

1775
05:59:01,639 --> 05:59:12,240
Where do I end up with your guarantee with a hundred spins? I want to make sure we get it in chat

1776
05:59:12,240 --> 05:59:20,299
I can't see ten K plus he says that seems

1777
05:59:21,340 --> 05:59:41,869
Thanks. They said ten K plus that's all right. Are you sure? Okay?

1778
05:59:41,869 --> 05:59:47,790
I guess if you're that confident, this is a two-week VIP or a two-week ban

1779
05:59:47,790 --> 05:59:51,119
He's got to get to a thousand bucks. We're almost there

1780
05:59:51,159 --> 06:00:01,040
But wait is it but you have to increase your bet size if you make a decent enough profit

1781
06:00:01,279 --> 06:00:07,040
We wait we this is these enough terms that we're describing here. What do you mean?

1782
06:00:07,040 --> 06:00:20,529
I thought it was a hundred spins at ten dollars a spin if you get ten K per movie IPM seriously

1783
06:00:20,610 --> 06:00:28,479
Say you get to like well, hello

1784
06:00:28,919 --> 06:00:33,639
So you get to like two or three to five K you have to increase my bet to what?

1785
06:00:33,959 --> 06:00:41,639
There's so many terms of this contract. There's so many terms to this agreement

1786
06:00:41,680 --> 06:00:47,360
Okay, so if I hit if I get to like three K

1787
06:00:47,360 --> 06:00:51,479
I then have to I'm I can't just go I need a thousand dollars

1788
06:00:51,639 --> 06:01:10,540
All right, so if I get to three K I up my bet to what twenty or thirty dollars make it three weeks

1789
06:01:15,779 --> 06:01:26,110
Did we did we get any more updated terms, okay, I have to watch XQC play this

1827
06:07:54,259 --> 06:08:03,720

1828
06:08:04,159 --> 06:08:13,810
Stop promoting gambling. I don't promote gambling. I think you should not gamble at all ever

1829
06:08:15,860 --> 06:08:20,340
unless

1830
06:08:21,340 --> 06:08:32,000
Just rewind 20 minutes and just watch like the 30-minute rant. I just had about this. I see candy

1831
06:08:32,500 --> 06:08:49,459
We need another piece of candy. Come on. You watch any GDQ. No, not yet. I probably will. Oh shit

1832
06:08:49,459 --> 06:09:09,060
All right, we got it. Come on. Come on times one. Give me more. Give me like a times a hundred

1833
06:09:09,520 --> 06:09:14,560
That's a 50 X right there. Oh, that sucks. That's so bad

1834
06:09:15,119 --> 06:09:18,799
Come on

1835
06:09:18,799 --> 06:09:29,959
Respins are well that enough respins don't count a hundred X. What's happened? Oh shit. Okay, uh

1836
06:09:30,840 --> 06:09:34,090
Respins don't count because they're not actually spins. Oh

1837
06:09:36,409 --> 06:09:47,740
We're it what's going on? What are you doing? It actually might happen

1838
06:09:48,180 --> 06:10:01,319
This is not pre-recorded by reading your message pigeon man 42. I just proved it right now

1839
06:10:01,720 --> 06:10:09,009
Not actually spin. No, it has to it has to be 100 actual paid spins. A free spin is a free spin

1840
06:10:09,009 --> 06:10:20,509
It doesn't count. It's part of a bonus. The bonus is its own encompassed thing. It doesn't count candy

1841
06:10:20,790 --> 06:10:36,189
It was a plant. It's so it's getting late too. I probably have to stop soon. All right, there's this free spins

1842
06:10:36,709 --> 06:10:41,000
Looking for a hundred X or I'll take a re-triggering

1843
06:10:41,520 --> 06:10:55,159
Give me another hundred X. It's time to raise the bet. That's I was not told to do that

1844
06:10:55,680 --> 06:10:58,299
There's a hundred X right there. Oh

1845
06:10:58,459 --> 06:11:00,459
Please why?

1846
06:11:01,029 --> 06:11:17,209
Watermelons, okay. Okay raise the bet to 50

1847
06:11:17,849 --> 06:11:32,959
Yeah, that know that I it was raised the bet to 50 if I when I got to 3k, that's pretty big

1848
06:11:34,759 --> 06:11:53,380
How do the bombs work? I don't know the bombs in the bonus seem to just be it just the add multiplier

1849
06:11:53,380 --> 06:12:04,459
All right. Come on. It's times one. He's saying to do it now. We've already locked it in

1850
06:12:04,459 --> 06:12:09,750
So I don't know wait he's saying do it now it would hear do we listen to this

1851
06:12:09,750 --> 06:12:18,979
He said he's saying he wants his remaining spins here to be 50. It actually might happen right here

1852
06:12:18,979 --> 06:12:24,279
I got four more free spins times two. Come on

1853
06:12:30,639 --> 06:12:36,610
That's gonna be huge times a hundred. All right. No, he's got it. That's he said 2k originally

1854
06:12:36,610 --> 06:12:48,450
He did he did say 2k originally. All right. All right. All right. Stop stop stop stop stop. Stop spinning. Stop spinning

1855
06:12:48,450 --> 06:12:50,630
I can't stop it

1856
06:12:50,630 --> 06:12:53,250
Stop auto spinning. How do I turn it off?

1857
06:12:53,290 --> 06:13:01,909
He said 3k, but he also he is saying he wants it to go

1858
06:13:01,909 --> 06:13:11,599
He wants to change it right now because in his original message

1859
06:13:11,599 --> 06:13:21,099
He said when you get to two comma three or five K to put it to fifty stir stir stir

1860
06:13:21,299 --> 06:13:36,110
Stir bean or whatever stir, but what are you in here? What do we got? Yes, they're here. Okay

1861
06:13:37,880 --> 06:13:43,840
Wait, we got a message. I needed to feel it out. You know what I'm saying force and CD. I'm ready for $50

1862
06:13:45,520 --> 06:13:50,759

Let's go. All right, let's go. Let's go. I'm gonna adhere to this. You ready? Let's go for it $50 spins here

1864
06:14:07,900 --> 06:14:28,119
He's gonna get banned. I don't know if there's another bonus with $50 bets. It could be a big deal. We'll see

1865
06:14:28,279 --> 06:14:35,700
I'm gonna hold my breath for a second though because you have to those three candies have to show up this too

1866
06:14:35,900 --> 06:14:38,720
If there's another one, this is a big deal. Oh

1867
06:14:41,669 --> 06:14:49,200
No, nothing is this the among us guy and that's my brother we share a

1868
06:14:49,840 --> 06:14:55,610
Channel and stuff. I think he sucks though. I don't think it's that funny. We have like pretty bad like family problems together

1869
06:14:55,610 --> 06:14:59,909
I think he's a fucking annoying little shit. I mean we do share the channel

1870
06:14:59,909 --> 06:15:13,740
We have like a contract and stuff mom. I mean my brother Jeremy

1871
06:15:14,659 --> 06:15:26,310
My name is Jerba. Our personality is like a little different. You can always tell who's who I'm the funny one

1872
06:15:26,310 --> 06:15:29,970
I'm like the one that's like we got it. We got it. Shut up. This joke sucks. Who cares? Let's go

1873
06:15:29,970 --> 06:15:41,540
What a stupid idea. Come on, let's go. This is it. This is his opportunity to make this happen nice, too

1874
06:15:41,540 --> 06:15:52,310
Oh, no right now. He's probably screaming. He wants to see a times 50 or a times 100. Oh, it's going though

1875
06:15:52,310 --> 06:15:57,520
Oh, no a 10k

1876
06:15:58,950 --> 06:16:10,330
10,000 I don't know man. I don't think it's gonna happen if the X Oh

Not much time left though. Really looking for those free spins. Holy shit. Holy shit. This is still going

1879
06:16:37,630 --> 06:16:53,930
Oh my god, but back on regular spins. No, don't be fooled by that counter. There's still about 20 more spins to add on top

1880
06:16:53,930 --> 06:17:20,779
I don't I I don't think it's gonna happen. I get why scheme auto pause. It's starting to drain Andy. No, ah

1881
06:17:24,330 --> 06:17:37,319
Come on, I want him to win. I'm rooting for him. Yeah, there are 16 more spins after this

1882
06:17:37,319 --> 06:17:58,799
It's looking pretty grim a lot of bombs but not gonna do anything. Oh, no

1883
06:17:59,380 --> 06:18:07,889
No, oh no, it's draining. It was at 3k. Oh

1884
06:18:12,959 --> 06:18:18,520
No, wait a minute redemption. Potentially. That's a bonus right now

1885
06:18:18,520 --> 06:18:38,150
If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen right here only times two nothing only 2x though. That's not very good

1886
06:18:38,389 --> 06:18:43,750
You need a big one. Oh

1887
06:18:53,520 --> 06:19:11,990
Nothing. I don't think it's gonna happen man. Nothing. No, why is it still going?

Oh, I feel so bad. I feel so bad. It's two weeks. That's so sad

1912
06:24:22,099 --> 06:24:34,150
I the bonus for wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's

1913
06:24:35,150 --> 06:24:46,950
$10,000 to buy the bonus. Never mind. All right, this one's for you. Sorry. You're gonna you're about to get banned for two weeks

1914
06:24:46,950 --> 06:25:02,580
I'm I feel really bad about it, but deal is a deal. Whatever. Okay. No, you have the floor

1915
06:25:02,580 --> 06:25:09,319
I would like to hear your last words. What are you? What are you? What's your final message? I will read it on stream

1916
06:25:09,479 --> 06:25:30,130
What is it? Oh, you already banned him. All right unban him so he can give his last words revive him

1917
06:25:30,130 --> 06:25:35,099
I I would I want he gets at least a full like at least few sentences

1918
06:25:35,299 --> 06:25:53,639
With confirmation of what what they said you can say pretty much or whatever you want. What do you say?

1919
06:25:53,720 --> 06:26:01,819
What do you wait? What do you say? I didn't catch it. I didn't see it. What was it?

1920
06:26:01,819 --> 06:26:26,130
I didn't see what he said. They said when next TF2 video what that's your final words

1921
06:26:26,529 --> 06:26:36,450
When when's next here are the next TF2 video is gonna be never I'm probably never gonna make a TF2 video ever again

1922
06:26:36,569 --> 06:26:46,549
Thanks for playing though, dude. It was fun. We'll see you again. Don't worry. Well, we will reserve your seat for you. I promise

1923
06:26:50,500 --> 06:26:55,540
Hey a stir Ben

1924
06:26:55,979 --> 06:27:08,509
67002 this one's for you. I'm back motherfuckers. He'll it

1925
06:27:11,590 --> 06:27:13,590
Ah

1926
06:27:20,220 --> 06:27:24,020
Music to it pops me up. I was doing it from stir Ben

1927
06:27:24,540 --> 06:27:34,459
These guys are just laughing about me every time I leave

1928
06:27:36,389 --> 06:27:44,270
Where was that last hand I guess the four give me up. You've got to be kidding me. Oh

1929
06:27:47,209 --> 06:27:50,909
Never mind, you got 21 great. Goodbye. Thanks. It was fun

1930
06:27:51,490 --> 06:28:07,299
I'm done. I'll see you guys later. I'm banned too. I'll see you guys on this weekend at some point

1931
06:28:07,540 --> 06:28:10,040
I'm gonna make sure I'll save the game. That's right

1932
06:28:11,439 --> 06:28:18,479
Probably Saturday or Sunday. I will let you know keep your ears to the ground for February 1st. That is the tentative damn holding in a perp

1933
06:28:21,959 --> 06:28:26,159
February 1st is the tentative date for the big stream. It should be a really fun time

1934
06:28:27,599 --> 06:28:29,599
It's something I've never really talked about

1935
06:28:29,639 --> 06:28:33,900
So if you're speculating on what it is, it's not really anything you've heard about

1936
06:28:33,900 --> 06:28:38,500
I don't think I've ever really talked about it. Maybe as a joke in passing

1937
06:28:38,979 --> 06:28:46,020
Well, like one second at some point, I don't think so though. Oh, this is I gotta hold on. Yeah, let me close this place

1938
06:28:49,040 --> 06:28:57,580
Oh, no, it's closer guy. We're already is closed. I think the next stream that I'm gonna do this weekend

1939
06:28:57,580 --> 06:29:03,479
It's either gonna be VR or I don't know. It depends on how I feel. I've been feeling kind of like shit lately

1940
06:29:03,479 --> 06:29:07,139
I've been really headachy and kind of sloppy. So depending on

1941
06:29:07,860 --> 06:29:14,110
All that plays out. It's either gonna be VR or I'll push VR to like middle of January

1942
06:29:15,909 --> 06:29:22,860
They will be streamed this weekend. I'll see you guys soon. Thanks for watching everybody and let me save the game

1943
06:29:22,979 --> 06:29:32,840
It is the middle of January. Well, it's

1944
06:29:33,479 --> 06:29:43,700
January 12th. Yeah, I guess it is but I mean let a few days the plan is so I can do VR

1945
06:29:44,619 --> 06:29:54,490
Before the big stream because the big stream is well, you know, I mean, I don't have to I have to tell you anything

1946
06:29:54,490 --> 06:30:12,380
Right. Give us a hint. No, no, it's zero into a riot. You want a hint?

1947
06:30:12,380 --> 06:30:18,669
Hmm

1948
06:30:18,669 --> 06:30:26,680
No, nope, I don't think so if I want to give you a hint

1949
06:30:26,680 --> 06:30:32,700
It'll be way closer to the event that might be more fun, but not two or three weeks out

1950
06:30:33,020 --> 06:30:40,400
Maybe on the stream before it happens. So thanks everybody for watching. We'll see you soon

1951
06:30:41,909 --> 06:30:49,880
Appreciate it a lot of people here tonight and I was late. I really appreciate it. Thanks for the raids

1952
06:30:49,880 --> 06:30:53,970
It was a couple raids that came in you're still here from those raids. Thanks for watching

1953
06:30:54,110 --> 06:31:00,880
Maybe we'll see you again. Have a beautiful evening. Well, we still have a few more minutes

1954
06:31:01,040 --> 06:31:23,009
Germa TV. Germa TV really is kind of I think that's probably still the most the least used emote

1955
06:31:23,009 --> 06:31:27,919
I think give us a fake hint. I could give you you know

1956
06:31:27,919 --> 06:31:38,720
I could give you three hints right and two of them aren't real. We could play that game. Maybe that might be fun

1957
06:31:38,720 --> 06:31:57,900
I don't know. It depends on how much I want to reveal. Thanks for staying up. This is fun game

1958
06:31:57,900 --> 06:32:03,200
I don't I'm not sure I'll return to it. Maybe I will maybe I won't it was a blast though

1959
06:32:08,279 --> 06:32:12,669
Yeah, aren't they doing this new thing with um, what was the thing?

1960
06:32:12,669 --> 06:32:20,740
I saw about the moments thing or you get a special badge if you were if you at a certain event or something or at

1961
06:32:20,740 --> 06:32:24,630
A certain stream. I feel like that's an awesome thing to have

1962
06:32:24,630 --> 06:32:28,540
I would have loved to have made that for something like dollhouse or something

1963
06:32:28,540 --> 06:32:37,340
At least for like the big event ones if you don't know that twitch is sort of doing like a little test on

1964
06:32:37,659 --> 06:32:44,659
Adding badges a different badge that you can kind of put instead of the other ones that are for specific

1965
06:32:44,979 --> 06:32:51,360
Streams that you were at if the streamer decided to make a special badge for it. That seems kind of interesting

1966
06:32:51,360 --> 06:32:57,270
I think that's way more. I think that's cooler than just simply having like a

1967
06:32:58,220 --> 06:33:01,159
How many bits I've given or how many subs I've given it's like, oh no

1968
06:33:01,159 --> 06:33:15,439
I was like at this stream and it was like fun, right? I think that's cool. It's your friend a happy birthday

1969
06:33:17,369 --> 06:33:20,979
Jayden, I wish your friend a happy birthday whenever it is

1970
06:33:21,020 --> 06:33:33,259
They can also be applied retroactively like you could do 2021's worst stream in best stream. Really? That's cool. All right

1971
06:33:33,259 --> 06:33:38,189
I'm into that imagine representing that has a badge

1972
06:33:38,830 --> 06:33:41,520
the smite stream from last year

1973
06:33:41,799 --> 06:33:56,340
Well, I was there worst dream like the idea 2013 or something that's fine like little t-shirts

1974
06:33:56,659 --> 06:34:06,310
All right guys, I'll see you this weekend. Have a great night. Let me drink some more water. I'm thirsty

1975
06:34:06,909 --> 06:34:11,900
Good night. Take care. Have a great week
