1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:23,460
Alright, let me change this to just chatting. Well, they were going to fix it tomorrow,

2
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,730
apparently, so let's really hope that they do. Rage 2 stream? I don't need any more rage.

3
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:40,009
I'm at like rage 10. I'm not at a rage 2 out of 10. I'm at like an 8 out of 10 for rage.

4
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,049
Use transformer to complain about cocks. Alright, we might as well.

5
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:54,679
We just need like audio for that anyways. I told you not to do cocks. This is the only

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,679
company. There's two companies here. It's cocks of CenturyLink and they're both dog shit.

7
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,099
There's no, you can't win. You don't, you're there, you cannot win with North American

8
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:33,030
internet. You have to roll dice. Just start your own company. I have CenturyLink. It's dog shit.

9
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,560
Like Google Fiber and there's like, why do you think everyone's moving to one

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,480
fucking city in this country that's a streamer? Because it's the only place with like real

11
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,500
reliable like fiber and they're not even doing that anymore. Didn't they can that?

12
00:01:49,500 --> 00:02:05,620
Remove shirt. Jerma's next up to be Sibyl's boyfriend? I don't know about that. Oh,

13
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:20,729
Jax net. Oh, it's because I'm right here. I see what you mean. I'm willing to let this

14
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:27,129
try to work itself out before I completely, you know, throw in the towel here.

15
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:50,419
Jax net. I need to move this camera. Hey, let's just stretch me out. I'll just look

16
00:02:50,419 --> 00:03:12,199
bigger. Oh, that doesn't work. Alright, so what do you guys want to talk about?

17
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:27,990
Ask me anything. Ask ask me literally anything. What is that shaped hair? It's called ice cream

18
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:38,180
melting over the side of the cone. Ask for that next time you go there. You got a job as a

19
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:48,520
substitute and any tips for a substitute teacher job? Um, yeah, it's I would pass that down to

20
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:59,509
any generation that wanted it. Any generation? Would you consider yourself a 90s kid? I mean,

21
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:07,400
I was born in 85. I got to change the title here to like frames are depleting. Oh, is it already

22
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:18,279
there? I think we're there, right? Would you watch this clip earlier in the stream? What did

23
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:25,959
I do earlier in the stream? God, you're so old. Yeah, I don't claim to be young. I don't

24
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:33,500
claim to be like a young man anymore. Straight frames depleted streamer defeated. I like

25
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:45,300
that. That's a good one. I like that one. Frames depleted streamer defeated. This has

26
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,250
to be from like the wind we've been getting lately. And just like I could sit here and be like,

27
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,939
I can't I got to just did it just go down when I did that?

28
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:18,810
Watch some videos. Maybe we'll watch some videos. All these Fortnite streamers are hogging the

29
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:34,699
good internet. Capitalize the D and depleted right now. Oh, fuck, you're right. I got

30
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:46,620
pants on. Rank the Star Wars movies. Star Wars. Two. Star Wars. Four. Star Wars. Seven. Star Wars.

31
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:58,540
Three. Star Wars. One. Star Wars. Are we going from best to worst? Why did I rank

32
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,420
episode two as the best Star Wars? I thought which way were we going? What am I gonna do

33
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:15,750
the sequel to Otto's Big Adventure 2? Never. Never. Unless it's a joke for like 10 seconds.

34
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:28,810
He's calling football plays. What would you sacrifice for a perfect internet? The top of

35
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:34,439
this pinky here. Like that would see that with this this top of this knuckle. Just take it off.

36
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:55,319
I don't I don't need that. Do I I don't need that. From like here down. I was born.

37
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Break out the red blend. No, I'm not drinking. I'm not. Why would I'm not going to start

38
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,310
drinking right now. That's not a sacrifice. I wouldn't even that's not a sacrifice. You

39
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,990
said I you said what would it take? And I said like the top half of my pinky. Well,

40
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,290
I don't know. Maybe like that's a sacrifice because it would be hard for me to grab stuff.

41
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,519
Break out the whiskey. No, no whiskey. No booze. No, I'm not like that upset about

42
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:33,850
this. I'm just like mildly irritated. I'm pretty upset by this. I'm actually very upset

43
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:41,990
by this. Don't let them fool you. Don't let me pretend. I'm like very upset by this.

44
00:07:42,949 --> 00:08:01,579
Play Mario Yahtzee. We might. Maybe. Maybe. Why is your face cam so noisy?

45
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:15,930
Yeah, that's right. Why is this so shitty looking? Well, it's because

46
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:33,610
it's because of this. It's like in a weird resolution. Yeah, look at this. This is what

47
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:46,179
we're what resolution even is this. It's great because I'm like sitting down on it.

48
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:56,470
Here. There you go. How mad am I on a relaxed to Hotline Miami 2?

49
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:10,009
Maybe maybe like the first the first like four pages of Green Eggs and Ham. You know what I

50
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:23,620
mean? That's where I'd say I am on a scale of like upset. Clean the closet. I will tomorrow.

51
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:34,309
Have I seen any celebrities in Las Vegas? No, I mean, again, no. Again, it's not a

52
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:43,429
uh I've seen Criss Angel go like this. It's huge. It's like on every building.

53
00:09:44,070 --> 00:10:02,440
How mad are you on a on the Richter scale? Like a mild. He still exists. Yeah, and apparently he

54
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:14,039
does. What's what's what's what's this? Let's watch some old videos. Yeah, let's watch some

55
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:30,070
old. Let's just chill. I'm defeated. 30,000 drop frames. That's too many. We've been

56
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:45,899
live for an hour. All right, let me set this up to get this to work. Let's um I had a friend

57
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:57,590
who believed everything Criss Angel did was actually magic. I mean, what is magic though?

58
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:11,399
Magic is it's just fooling and you know subversion, right? All right, let me put this

59
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,639
over here. What do you guys want to watch? What like you want to watch a video of mine?

60
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:29,340
You want to watch an old video? Should we like vote on these? I don't know how we would

61
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:42,460
vote on them. Put on a rat movie of Otto's Big Adventure. Watch yesterday's stream.

62
00:11:52,570 --> 00:12:01,110
I'm not gonna watch yesterday's stream. That was a lot of fun, but watch death to spies.

63
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:12,620
Oh yeah, the with the graph. I forgot about this. This video has a million views.

64
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:23,029
Holy shit. Watch your least liked video. I don't know. I don't want to do that.

65
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:38,809
Your least liked video. Let's see. I don't even know. Can I even sort on a channel for that?

66
00:12:39,370 --> 00:13:03,580
It's a little bigger. No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop it. Stop it. Okay,

67
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:13,299
I stopped it. So now let's put this on here. I should be able to turn it on.

68
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:24,220
Hey, this has this video has the same amount of likes that I have dropped frames today.

69
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:55,419
Let's full screen this death despise. This is an old one. Can I, I got to give myself a spot here,

70
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:02,820
right? This is the video that got you into the channel. Really? That's this is some of the

71
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,309
funniest fucking shit I think I ever saw in a video game. Can I not like just make this be

72
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:22,820
the whole screen? Why are you doing this? Come on. Come on. What are you doing? This is killing

73
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:28,649
me. All right, let's watch. Let's watch death despise. It's been a while since I've seen

74
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:46,090
this. In fact, I think it's been years since I've opened this video. Let's watch it. Okay.

75
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:58,090
Here we go. That's as loud as it can get. I feel like this would be louder.

76
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:09,320
And I'll make that louder. Guys, I don't do this. I never like do like videos on stream.

77
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,629
Is that getting louder for you guys? I think it is. Yeah, it is. All right, there we go.

78
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:33,980
That's better. Where am I supposed to bring this guy? This is a gigantic base with people

79
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,370
in it. How am I supposed to sneak him out? He's extract captive. Oh, the body can be

80
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,710
hidden in a truck. And that makes sense. Okay, well, you stay put. I'll be back.

81
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:53,700
I killed him. I've been sitting here for at least a few minutes, trying to figure out what exactly

82
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,159
this fucking guy is doing. Well, yeah, what the fuck is he? He's like cleaning down this

83
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:07,320
old rusty cabinet with his hands. Or is he looking for a stud? That's a good one. That's

84
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:21,659
a good one. Stop. Stop it, please. I had to do that. You had. Pause it. Pause it. I'll

85
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:28,059
give you some insight information here. So this is there was a spot here that I tried to go into,

86
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,350
like, probably 30 to 40 times. It took a long time to get in this exact area where I couldn't

87
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:40,230
get shot. And this is where I figured out that people were just dumping into the room.

88
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:47,509
And I died so many times here trying to fit myself in this one spot to go underneath.

89
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,379
Because your head is underneath and they can't hit you. Yeah, it was like a pixel that you could

90
00:16:53,379 --> 00:17:01,909
step on. Oh, he found me. He found me. He is trying to figure out how to shoot me right now.

91
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:10,309
Oh, shit. That you like that fucking hat over there. I can't seem to hit it. How do I hit

92
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:20,119
this fucking hat that's on the ground? You guys are so stupid. You can't hit the fucking.

93
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,269
All right. So here's another thing, right? I was trying to like set this up because I

94
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:30,099
thought this was funny. And the grenade coming into the room is something that I never prepared

95
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:41,640
for. There was no way I could have ever prepared for that. It was like no fucking way. I have

96
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,049
to do this a bunch more times. So I was trying to get them to miss me while I was the hat

97
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:51,690
on the ground. And it turned into this. So the hat on the ground. Is that what you're saying?

98
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,289
Flying by and dropping missiles on this place. Stop with the fucking.

99
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:25,769
Are you kidding me? Are you guys kidding me right now? People are all out of their minds.

100
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,009
They keep coming in here, realizing where I am. And then somebody throws a grenade into the

101
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:40,150
room and they have to leave. And some of them actually die. This shit was so fucking funny.

102
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,190
There he is. I found him. Oh, wait, Jerry, did you just throw a grenade into the room?

103
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,670
They all run out. They all like scatter. How much one of you morons is going to throw

104
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:58,779
the grenade? That's the question. We got the whole troop in here. Who is going to be the

105
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:10,759
finger moron that does it? Oh, get him. The hold up. I don't understand what the hold up is.

106
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,380
Was it you? Was it you? Somebody comes in and fucking throws it at her.

107
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:42,200
What's going on? Oh, put this gun over. He's like, what happened over here?

108
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,410
This dude, this guy aiming the gun that way. Throw it. Throw the grenade. Here we go.

109
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,529
This is my favorite one. Somebody comes in and throws it after I throw one, I think, right?

110
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:05,609
Yes, this guy went in here. He's sitting there standing looking.

111
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,930
You threw it into the wall. He throws it in and then he walks in the room.

112
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,410
I've just been reloading this over and over again. It's true. I was.

113
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,880
That guy didn't even attempt to get out of the way.

114
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:30,380
I forgot about that one. Something interesting. If you take a look at the guy that just stands

115
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,130
there and just goes, this is the best game ever, man. Like this is seriously one of the

116
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:45,779
funniest fucking, they don't make them like this anymore. That guy didn't even attempt to get

117
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:51,619
out of the way. Oh yeah. This next part too. I don't, I could like stream this game. I

118
00:20:51,700 --> 00:21:01,369
probably could. But the next part where you're the chef and that's like a super disguise,

119
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:04,250
apparently. I don't know when nobody can see through it, right? Oh, no, no. Only one guy

120
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,319
could see through disguises. It was the chef. That's it. Something interesting. It was unfucking

121
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,160
real. Take a look at the mini map. You see all the green blobs. Those are all the people,

122
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,440
all the guards, all the hotel staff, all the people here cannot see through my disguise.

123
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,400
There's one red blip. Do you want to know who it is? The chef. There are other chefs in

124
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:36,460
here that can't see through. Right. So explain to me why other chefs couldn't see through my

125
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:46,380
disguise. One chef, everybody else. I don't get it. Throw a fucking plate in this guy's face.

126
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:58,980
This guy grabbed my leg. What is going on? What is hurting me?

127
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:10,839
Did I freeze in the freezer? Oh, don't tell me you can freeze in the freezer. Do not give

128
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,839
me that kind of power. Hey, Gary, just the man I wanted to see. Hey, look, can you go

129
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,920
ahead and grab me some extra kebabs from the fruit? What a fucking idiot. What an idiot.

130
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:33,529
I know. Do me a favor, Gary. Freeze. He's not freezing. Bullshit. This guy immune to cold.

131
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,180
This was horseshit. I was so mad about this. Why do I freeze in here, but he doesn't?

132
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:49,349
That's bullshit. Gary. I was hoping that that actually froze. The internet froze it.

133
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:57,430
Um, what I was actually hoping was going to happen there was that I could fill that freezer

134
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,869
with people. Just like have, just keep like throwing coins or whatever, throwing stuff in

135
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,990
there and they would just keep going in there and it would close the door and they would

136
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:10,660
just be in there. Would it feel weird recording a game for a video without a live audience

137
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:17,160
anymore? Yeah, probably. Because honestly, people say, oh, you don't, you know, I don't

138
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:24,200
make videos anymore, but this is the, I did this same shit off stream when I'd stream a game.

139
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,880
Now I just, I treat it the same way as if I was going to make a video on it essentially.

140
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:36,819
So it's, it's different, but it's also kind of the same. Now there's live feedback for

141
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:42,900
everything and I don't edit things out. I don't put things like in like graphic layovers

142
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:50,440
or sound or music or something, right? So it's, it's a, it's different, but it's also pretty,

143
00:23:50,440 --> 00:24:00,359
it's very much the same too. So I play games off stream sometimes, not that much anymore though,

144
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:10,660
but here we go. The guy in the chair, he won't even suspect the goddamn thing. Oh yeah,

145
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,900
that's the guy that I was supposed to save. I was supposed to like go bug that guy or

146
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:25,369
something, right? I'm not even making sounds. I'm not doing anything in here.

147
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:31,720
Are you seriously wondering how that guy died? You opened the door and I did it.

148
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:40,740
Don't fuck with Jeff. Oh, $800. This part. My mission is to find the mole.

149
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:48,980
I've got to be quick. I've got to be silent and unseen. I find my target. He's this guy.

150
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,259
I throw a piece of china right in his mouth. Mission accomplished.

151
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:01,059
I can now escape undetected. This game was out of control. You know, I really wish they

152
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:06,740
would play something else. You're right, Jerry. And I agree. I think this piano player really

153
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,539
needs to shut the fuck up. Get some rock music in here. You know what I'm saying?

154
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,519
Was I spawning spoons? Where did I get these from? No, I was just taking them off the

155
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,480
tables. Right. I'm just being annoying right now. That's all I'm doing.

156
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:36,980
Just ruining these people's dinner. Oh, I forgot people just came in and pissed on you.

157
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,430
Excuse me. Are you serious? Occupied. Get out of here. What are you doing? Get away from me.

158
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:53,670
Oh, good afternoon. Yeah, there's somebody in this one. Yeah. No, somebody's still in it.

159
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:59,980
Thank you for understanding. Second time. Third time. He doesn't. He's going to piss in my

160
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:08,940
face. He just comes in. They don't care. The AI doesn't even know you're in there.

161
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:20,069
They just fucking pee. Grab that auto. I almost died making grab that auto. That last part.

162
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:27,319
It's been, I haven't seen these in a long time. It's been a very long time.

163
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:36,009
Grab that auto. All right, we'll do grab that auto. Oh, subscribe for more.

164
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:44,019
Four years ago, we've decided to tell you to do that, you know.

165
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:49,769
Role playing duck gamers. Oh, I forgot about that one too. I forgot about all these

166
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:55,849
videos. All right, give me, give me one second. I want to go grab, I want to grab

167
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:04,980
some water. I'll be right back. Also, again, thanks everybody for your patience and shit.

168
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:11,460
I'm sorry that we had to kind of dip out and do something else for a little while,

169
00:27:11,460 --> 00:31:13,400
but I do, I really appreciate it. Let's move on. I'll be right back.

170
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:20,099
Oh fuck, it's getting worse, isn't it? Holy shit, it's getting worse.

171
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:35,140
I left at 40,000 drop frames and now there's 47,000 drop frames. Shit.

172
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:50,650
It's, we keep, we're hitting this like critical mass right now. All right, let's uh,

173
00:31:51,450 --> 00:32:05,880
let's put on grab that auto five. Grab that auto five. You know what's one thing that's

174
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:14,460
interesting is the, is the view counts on some of these videos. Like I, grab that auto

175
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:22,519
five is four and a half million views. That's fucking crazy. I, that's, how? That's a lot.

176
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:41,269
It's interesting to go back and kind of see just how these videos have grown in a way. Fuck.

177
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,740
Guys, guys, this is not looking good. This is bad. This is like, I don't even,

178
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:12,420
this is not good. This is not good. Fuck. People watching more than once. Yeah, no,

179
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,920
that's, that's awesome. Like, I'm glad that people have been able to watch these videos

180
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,960
more than once and still like them and still watch them. It's, that's fucking cool. I'm glad

181
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,650
you like it that much. I had some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life

182
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:39,099
was making some of these videos. Most of them actually. So it's, don't give up. Don't give up.

183
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,589
Um, it may be time to give up.

184
00:33:53,140 --> 00:34:04,789
It may be time to give up. Well, I'm going to stick it up for a little longer,

185
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:11,269
but it's getting worse as we go along here. We get, grab that auto on the screen.

186
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:16,789
Um, so if, if, if I might, I might get cut off completely here. So let me just tell you the

187
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:24,500
plan. Uh, if this does happen. So the plan, they're supposed to be like really looking

188
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:30,920
into this and fixing this tomorrow. So I'm going to take tomorrow off, let them just do

189
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,239
what they need to do. I'm going to stay on top of it and we're going to get it settled.

190
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:41,380
Right. So, but because this stream is going to be really all over the place and like

191
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:47,190
barely a stream, uh, after Monday, I'm going to try to come back on Tuesday

192
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,630
and we'll just go Tuesday, Wednesday, right? Like I'll just take this one day while they try

193
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:56,019
to fix it. So that plan is to come back on Tuesday, Wednesday, and probably Tuesday,

194
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:04,360
Wednesday, Thursday, I would assume. But I've been, I was told explicitly that they like,

195
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,519
they were really going to get like to work on. And I think they know what the problem is,

196
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,139
but let's use the finite amount of time that we still have and watch another video.

197
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:33,980
So let's put this on the screen. Hello. I'm John. Hello. Hello, John. Uh, I actually need to

198
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:51,690
go like this. I got like an ad. Hold on. Let me let the ad play out first. This is a

199
00:35:51,690 --> 00:36:03,860
nine minute video. I didn't even realize that. Okay. This should be it. Hey, look at that.

200
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:16,260
Is that in the right spot? I think it is. All right. Hi, grab that auto five chin cam

201
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:30,630
incoming. It's also been a very long time since I've seen this one too. Let's go ahead

202
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,269
and type in grand theft auto into the app store search bar. Don't do this if you have never done

203
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:40,630
it before. GTA type GTA legit, right? Looks pretty San Andreas. You got vice city.

204
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:50,550
And you got all this. Let's what is all this? Grab the auto five type in GTA into the app

205
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:57,639
store and accidentally download me grand auto gets good and a thumb stick is right on an ad.

206
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,739
So we're off to a great start here. Do I have a mission to do?

207
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:11,300
Or is this just pop in the game? This this engine, whatever it is, can't even load

208
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,579
15 feet in front of me. I'm not even sure there's anything I can do here.

209
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,820
Besides just drive around in the city and just walk around.

210
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:37,110
Doesn't like Apple have to approve. Let's get out and walk. Does this actually have a radio

211
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:45,800
like GTA as well? I want that bike. Give me that bike. Yes. Thank you. Thank you

212
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,000
for getting off of your bike and dying. No, he doesn't. He didn't. He kicks my ass, doesn't he?

213
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,880
Oh my god. I have to unlock. Everything has to be unlocked. Money and diamonds and shit.

214
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,940
Let's get back in my burger car. One of the only cars I can fucking drive.

215
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:10,150
Hold on. 15 diamonds. There it is. The best one. They take a very long time to load.

216
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:19,429
This one has graphics. This music is so annoying. I've memorized this whole song.

217
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:27,780
Is anyone driving this car? No, there's not. Nobody's driving the car. How do I shut this music off?

218
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:47,639
Can't get over this music. Oh, this is like the Fred Flintstone one.

219
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,239
I probably got so many viruses. Camera. I probably got put on so many lists.

220
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:12,980
Why is it just singing to me? Is that a police car or is that a bird like a chickeny?

221
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:22,099
Cops found you. Get rid of them. Sounds like Kirby.

222
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,539
Holy shit. What am I supposed to do? How do you beat that?

223
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:33,929
See, the greatest part about this is these two guys that-

224
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:35,769
Riding a star. That's right. Don't care at all.

225
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,000
This is pretty normal to them, apparently.

226
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:48,519
Just a normal day in Shitsville. Two guys shooting at each other through a bunch of

227
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:55,780
fucking bricks. Oh my god. Why can't you make a full game like this?

228
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:03,380
What was in those guns? You can't be in that car.

229
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:11,590
Those were Chad's next car game.

230
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,460
Well, we know this guy really likes this song. That's good to know.

231
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:23,380
At least he's got a favorite song. This one's real bare bones.

232
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,539
One. There was no loading screen.

233
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:27,219
There was no menu. It's just one.

234
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:33,719
I wish I could explain how hard this was to move.

235
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,659
Mapping in the corner was so bad.

236
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,380
Holy shit. That's a lot of money.

237
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:46,119
That guy was holding a bank vault worth of money.

238
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:49,449
Go get it. 20 bucks.

239
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:54,789
That was a stack. Pretend to play it?

240
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:58,539
Psycho. I can follow that guy.

241
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:02,969
Get out of the window. Just rip him out of the windshield.

242
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,420
What is going on with- That guy just turned into a bunch of luggage.

243
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:10,820
Mack truck. This guy's gonna-

244
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:15,980
Oh. Pull him over.

245
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:39,320
Time paradox. Same game, same engine, same music.

246
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,760
The only difference is this time they decided to make you a robot Spider-Man.

247
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,630
Forgot the script. I guess this one's a slot machine.

248
00:41:52,199 --> 00:42:00,489
I'm gonna give it 15 seconds before I get run over.

249
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,539
Somebody behind me? Somebody's just throwing punches at me.

250
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:10,230
Get out of here. Are you serious?

251
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:15,480
Is he still behind me? He died.

252
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:20,460
This is another goal-less game.

253
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,679
This honestly was one of the top five funniest things ever.

254
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,780
I literally turned into a cackling witch at the end of this video.

255
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,000
This went on for so long. All right, hold on. I gotta pause this.

256
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,519
You know how you've asked before the differences between streaming and YouTube, right?

257
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,039
Well, the differences between something like this.

258
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:46,920
If I streamed this, if I streamed this game and streamed doing this like

259
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,199
ran the thought oh kind of bit.

260
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:52,150
This went on for a very long time.

261
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:55,989
Went on for fucking like this would have- this never was going to stop.

262
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,829
We could have sat here on stream and watched that for like 30 straight minutes.

263
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:07,750
And the differences I guess were because I didn't- you don't-

264
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,750
I didn't even want a video to be like a 20-40 minute long video.

265
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,469
I cut it down.

266
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:19,980
We would have been able to see this live happen in complete and total present reality.

267
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:26,199
And we could have- I could have gotten up and I would have just left it on the fucking stream.

268
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,219
I would have left it there for an hour.

269
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:33,619
So that would have been the difference is we would be able to sit there the

270
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,380
whole time and let it just play out forever.

271
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:40,619
But nevertheless, it was still fucking hysterical.

272
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,019
Ruby, you fucking idiots.

273
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:46,219
Where are all these people coming from? Why are they fighting?

274
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:47,019
Oh my god.

275
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,699
This shit was so fucking funny.

276
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:52,059
This guy was in slow motion.

277
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:56,010
Two people were like, why?

278
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,610
This dude is gonna stop fighting them?

279
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,539
Why would you start fighting this guy?

280
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,710
I don't know.

281
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,590
I don't understand.

282
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:12,519
Is there a reason why these people are all doing this?

283
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,340
Consider what?

284
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,980
It's a conga line of people punching each other in the back.

285
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:28,179
And then flying away.

286
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:34,710
Oh, this went on for so long.

287
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,670
Just wait till you see.

288
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,789
Like if you haven't seen this.

289
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,489
Oh, I'm gonna need a minute after this one.

290
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:49,769
I was dying.

291
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,659
I was fucking crying.

292
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,860
It's never gonna stop.

293
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,619
This is never gonna stop.

294
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:05,130
Listen to that.

295
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:05,849
I'm like dying.

296
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:06,570
I'm gonna die.

297
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,809
I'm seriously gonna die.

298
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,050
I'm gonna live through this one.

299
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:26,280
This is the best thing I've ever seen in any game.

300
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,239
Just never ending spawn.

301
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:36,739
Just flies.

302
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:37,780
I don't ever want this to end.

303
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,019
I don't want to hit pause.

304
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:41,219
I don't want to hit replay.

305
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:42,179
I don't want to stop it.

306
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:43,539
But you know what?

307
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:44,099
It's...

308
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:44,980
I gotta get out of here.

309
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,260
I have to stop this.

310
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,760
Wow.

311
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,519
Is it first ever I gotta get out of here?

312
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:53,079
Holy shit.

313
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:54,199
That might be first ever.

314
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:58,409
Four years ago.

315
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,019
Because I'm seriously gonna throw up if I stay here any longer.

316
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:04,940
As amazing as this is.

317
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:07,420
So I'll talk.

318
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,070
Hell yeah.

319
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:12,869
Of rewards.

320
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,510
30.

321
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,630
29 actually.

322
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,130
29.

323
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:33,800
I think I was like 28 or 29.

324
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,000
29 I think.

325
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,039
29 by the way.

326
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:48,840
Now we'll play role playing duck gamers.

327
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:50,980
That's an old one too.

328
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:54,099
Uh I think I can...

329
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:54,980
Can I...

330
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,099
I think I can just get it through here.

331
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:56,739
Can I?

332
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:57,860
I'm like interacting, right?

333
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:01,929
Or do I have to redo this?

334
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,780
I should be able to...

335
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,460
Can I not interact with it?

336
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,030
Interact.

337
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,590
That's why.

338
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,550
Is it because it's full screen?

339
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,030
Why can I...

340
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,349
Come on.

341
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,880
Apparently not.

342
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:26,199
No!

343
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:27,639
Why are you doing this?

344
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:33,369
Well I will try to pull it from here.

345
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,849
Role playing duck gamers.

346
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:43,380
This video was not that long ago either.

347
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,340
2015.

348
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,699
2015 was a good year.

349
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,940
Alright no ad.

350
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,420
That's good.

351
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:00,739
No ad.

352
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:06,329
God!

353
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:14,010
There wasn't an ad on here!

354
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:14,809
There was no ad!

355
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,250
Alright here we go.

356
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,570
This is uh Star and I jumped into duck game and after...

357
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:26,789
I don't know maybe like 20 minutes of playing it we figured out that

358
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:30,789
it was fun just to pretend to talk through the character's voices

359
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:32,710
by pressing the button that makes you quack.

360
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,769
And nothing else mattered at that point.

361
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:42,409
Nothing mattered.

362
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:43,530
Only that.

363
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,099
So here we go.

364
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:46,539
Role playing duck gamers.

365
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:59,219
You dropped your burger on the ground there.

366
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,619
Hey have you ever seen that movie Super Mario Brothers 2?

367
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:07,980
It's pretty cool.

368
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:11,900
You see the main character Super Mario he goes like this

369
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,460
and he gets in and he rages the game.

370
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:15,900
That doesn't even hurt.

371
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,539
That doesn't even hurt.

372
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:19,289
Where's the gun?

373
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:20,730
Give me that gun.

374
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:22,699
That's a lot.

375
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:23,260
Give me this gun.

376
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,900
Give me that gun.

377
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:25,369
I win.

378
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,670
That's like more fun.

379
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,329
You got me.

380
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:32,969
Today is your unlucky day motherfucker.

381
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:35,019
Yeah.

382
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:36,219
Yeah.

383
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,639
Oh yeah.

384
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:38,360
Gotcha.

385
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,159
Gotcha motherfucker.

386
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,139
I don't think that's gonna stop being funny.

387
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:45,920
What's wrong?

388
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:47,340
Having some trouble?

389
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,320
Come on now.

390
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:49,880
What do you got?

391
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,440
You got a pistol.

392
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,920
I got a pistol.

393
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,719
I'm gonna shoot you with this pistol.

394
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:53,320
Duck.

395
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,400
Jump.

396
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:56,809
Get ready.

397
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:57,929
I mean get ready.

398
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,059
It's actually kind of hard.

399
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:06,380
It's hard to like hit B and make the mouth open and play the game at the same time.

400
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,099
It's very hard.

401
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:08,539
Watch out I got a shotgun.

402
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:09,260
I got one too.

403
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,940
I'm gonna blast you.

404
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,659
You're gonna blast me?

405
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,099
I'm gonna throw it.

406
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:14,860
You think you're gonna blast me?

407
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,460
Well I'm not gonna now I don't have a shotgun.

408
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,099
Come chase me.

409
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,860
What?

410
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,360
Come chase me?

411
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,920
I don't know.

412
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:24,519
Come chase me.

413
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:25,880
You're the one with the gun.

414
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,920
This is so fun.

415
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,800
What a fun thing.

416
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,519
We're gonna do it just like they used to do in the old times.

417
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,440
Back to back ten paces.

418
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,929
Turn around.

419
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:37,690
Okay in ten paces.

420
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:38,989
Go.

421
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:43,769
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten.

422
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:47,070
Die.

423
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:50,889
My die was like eight syllables.

424
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:57,849
Look look this is the gun from Earthworm Jim.

425
00:50:57,849 --> 00:50:58,349
Cool huh?

426
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,599
Cool.

427
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,099
Duck game.

428
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:02,039
On Steam.

429
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:03,559
Currently part of the Steam sale.

430
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:04,440
Pick it up today.

431
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,800
You're gonna have fun with all your friends.

432
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,559
Like this guy.

433
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,440
He's my friend.

434
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,480
But is he really though?

435
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,119
I don't know.

436
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:10,760
Could he be?

437
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,800
I have no idea.

438
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,360
Friends.

439
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,159
I love friends.

440
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:13,800
Fuck this video.

441
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,320
Fuck this whole thing.

442
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,519
This whole thing sucks.

443
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:17,800
Fuck this video.

444
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,760
When I sit up here and stare at this red beam.

445
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:22,760
I think about my life.

446
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,940
And where I've been.

447
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,659
And where I'll go.

448
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,820
And what?

449
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:29,159
Aliens.

450
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,929
Are we the aliens to aliens?

451
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:40,309
We just want to watch the world burn.

452
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:42,389
That's a Batman quote.

453
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,190
Some people just want to watch the world burn.

454
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,550
I wonder how long this recording has been.

455
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:49,500
Hello there.

456
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,699
Welcome to the shoe shop.

457
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,650
Okay so I have this pair of shoes for only 12 dollars.

458
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,969
Wait are we dead dead?

459
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,929
We good?

460
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:02,489
Dead dead?

461
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,329
Doesn't look like it.

462
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,130
Almost.

463
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:05,369
Close.

464
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:06,250
That was really close.

465
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:08,570
I'll rewind.

466
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:09,289
I gotta rewind.

467
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:15,099
Okay.

468
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:20,750
I just want to watch the world burn.

469
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,050
That's a Batman quote.

470
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:23,929
Okay hold on.

471
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:24,969
I need to pause this.

472
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:29,869
I feel like the like this this was the just both of these characters are just

476
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,119
yeah oh by the way you know that I spent I spent like 45 minutes the other night on

477
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,119
knowyourmeme.com trying to and just typing in things people have written in like bit donations

478
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:02,010
I actually was doing that trying to catch up

479
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:09,150
I wonder how long this recording has been.

480
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,599
Hello there.

481
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:12,800
Welcome to the shoe shop.

482
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,380
Okay so I have this pair of shoes for only 12 dollars.

483
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,840
I'll take them.

484
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,320
Okay good.

485
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,449
Yes my old nemesis.

486
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:26,329
The hamburger head.

487
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:28,489
Those of you that know who he is.

488
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,090
He's a dastardly villain and he must be destroyed.

489
00:53:32,889 --> 00:53:34,829
You have to come down here.

490
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:35,309
Yeah I know.

491
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:37,079
I will eventually.

492
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,440
I'm doing my monologue.

493
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,760
It's incredibly important to the story arc of my character.

494
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,010
I don't I seriously don't know how.

495
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:46,969
Go get him Glenn.

496
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:48,489
I can even I could tolerate as a person.

497
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,090
That's the gun from uh that's the moon gun.

498
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,369
I'm gonna catch it in my mouth.

499
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:53,849
Hold on.

500
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:54,969
No no don't die don't die.

501
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:03,469
There he is.

502
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:05,630
Ladies and gentlemen that's the guy that had my character.

503
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:06,829
I have to go to kill that guy.

504
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:08,110
It's part of my character story life.

505
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:17,550
All right you got all right do you know you know when somebody's having too way too much fun.

506
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,389
I'm having like so much like too much fun.

507
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,329
I don't I seriously don't know how many more of these I can.

508
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:35,849
I can't tolerate as a person.

509
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,449
That's the gun from uh that's the moon gun.

510
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:40,730
I'm gonna catch it in my mouth.

511
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:41,289
Hold on.

512
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:42,329
No no don't die don't die.

513
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:50,800
There he is.

514
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,960
Ladies and gentlemen that's the guy that had my character.

515
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,159
I have to go to kill that guy.

516
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:55,440
It's part of my character story life.

517
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,340
Catch it in my mouth.

518
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,019
All right so your first day on the job here at Edwards construction.

519
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,699
You got to be careful.

520
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:13,789
Told you to be careful.

521
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,840
And that's when she told me to go to school.

522
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,639
She wanted to see me.

523
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,760
Well you're really fucking this up aren't you.

524
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,039
This turns into animal.

525
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:32,139
Are we the aliens to that planet?

526
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,500
Makes sense in my opinion.

527
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,360
Although a more existential way to look at it is probably like this.

528
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:50,570
Can you believe Carol?

529
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:51,530
Carol in accounting.

530
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,570
Man she really gave me the ride.

531
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:55,849
I have to get back to work.

532
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,239
Yeah you do.

533
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:00,800
I don't know why you've been doing that.

534
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,079
Seems kind of expensive.

535
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:09,130
All right I'm ready.

536
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:11,929
Okay I'm gonna catch it in my mouth.

537
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:13,050
Didn't we just do this?

538
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:26,190
Okay I just want to say congratulations on being number one.

539
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,710
You don't talk to me.

540
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:28,750
You deserve that trophy.

541
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,110
Your second place I win.

542
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,000
You don't talk to me.

543
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,800
Your second place I win.

544
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:46,219
This video is so much fun to make.

545
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,480
Oh speaking of Star.

546
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,659
You'll be pleased to know that we're probably going to play something fairly soon.

547
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:02,409
I actually just talked to him like a few days ago.

548
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,619
So Jerma and Star.

549
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:09,099
Everybody wants to see this fucking happen.

550
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:10,860
I'm not playing that video though.

551
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,260
That's an embarrassing, that's an embarrassment to me video.

552
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,320
Yeah we were talking about just playing some ram stuff so this should be fun.

553
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:24,329
Do it!

554
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:24,730
Do it!

555
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,210
Do it!

556
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,010
No I can't do it.

557
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,449
We've got them dropping too many frames.

558
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:28,329
You wouldn't even be able to see it.

559
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,400
Tactical intervention.

560
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,360
That's another one that was...

561
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:36,030
I want to like...

562
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,760
Yeah we got to watch the tactical intervention video.

563
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,960
That video is fucked.

564
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,239
That game is fucked.

565
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:51,159
That game is insane.

566
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,630
If you type tactical intervention.

567
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,159
It's Star and my videos of what happens here.

568
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:22,250
All right let's load it up.

569
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:27,289
Jerma is mad.

570
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:27,849
Part three.

571
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:33,769
Now let me open this up.

572
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:38,440
Which this should...

573
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,400
What's this on here?

574
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:43,659
How many of those did he make?

575
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,920
He made a lot of those didn't he?

576
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:51,340
I got it.

577
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,539
I caught it before it could happen.

578
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:02,539
We I saved you from watching the ghost recon breakpoint explode inside of your ears ad video.

579
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,469
Why am I getting two ads back to back?

580
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:09,530
What is up with this?

581
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:10,730
Since when?

582
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:15,199
All right here we go.

583
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,159
Three two one play it.

584
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:39,500
It's just it's just showing us the scenery.

585
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,380
Yeah why isn't it just...

586
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:42,219
Okay here we go.

587
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:43,420
Oh god this is so loud.

588
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,380
Why is it so loud?

589
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,179
Every game is loud.

590
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,780
And now you're you're wicked loud again.

591
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,659
This siren.

592
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,579
You are so loud.

593
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:54,489
I guess I'm ready.

594
00:59:55,289 --> 00:59:59,389
This siren does not stop for the entire video.

595
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,630
This is the loudest game ever.

596
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:04,909
Oh my god I'm driving.

597
01:00:04,909 --> 01:00:06,030
Are you driving?

598
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:06,510
I'm in the car.

599
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,150
I'm in your car.

600
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:08,909
Are you behind me?

601
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:09,710
Yeah I'm behind you.

602
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:17,420
That shit's fucking so stupid.

603
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,340
This is a secret highway route.

604
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,500
But everything is so loud and you are so loud.

605
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,739
You are so loud right now.

606
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,340
I'm sorry.

607
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,260
Your microphone is so fucked.

608
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,260
Hey look at this car.

609
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:34,539
I can't control this.

610
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,340
What is the objective?

611
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:44,199
I'm passing out dude.

612
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,679
The world is closing in.

613
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:49,559
The world is closing in.

614
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,480
It started to see black like I was fainting.

615
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,309
Do we get out?

616
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,440
And we won the game.

617
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,239
All right so something really important because the thing with making a video

618
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:29,340
after the fact there was three tracks right?

619
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,460
There was the game audio, there was my audio, and there was star's audio.

620
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:38,920
So every time you'd make a video you'd have three different audio timelines

621
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,199
in your editing software.

622
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,960
So to be able to have this video actually play audibly

623
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,280
in any video, it didn't matter which one it was,

624
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,000
you played with the audio levels to make it so the tracks

625
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
weren't too overbearing or too horrible.

626
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:57,000
This video, what you're hearing does not do justice to how loud this actually was.

627
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,519
This had to be dropped like 75% to not be completely blowing out

628
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:04,599
every single person's eardrums that watched the video.

629
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
So like how loud this was.

630
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,119
He is, and not just the game, for some reason his microphone was like

631
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:14,199
I'm gonna peek and break and be loud as fuck too.

632
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:23,130
It was just, listen to why when he says we win you can hear his mic crying.

633
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:27,929
Do we get out?

634
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:31,289
No, no, don't get out, don't get out.

635
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,090
I can't, I can't get out.

636
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,769
No, I'm driving.

637
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:36,650
Do you hear that?

638
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:39,639
It's so bad.

639
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,840
Peek your mic, peek your mic.

640
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,599
Yeah, we're off, we're off, we're on, we're off, we're on.

641
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:51,360
Highway mode was so good.

642
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:57,769
Some of these first experiences in these games,

643
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,429
I'll never forget that.

644
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:02,190
I will never forget how funny that was.

645
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:05,929
We didn't even know what we were playing.

646
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:07,050
It was just like, let's play this.

647
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,170
This sounds like fun.

648
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,730
It's by the guy that made Counter-Strike, right?

649
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:13,050
That's what you knew when you went into that.

650
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:13,769
That's all you knew.

651
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:18,599
So guy that made Counter-Strike made this game.

652
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:21,000
Oh, let's play it together and maybe we'll record it.

653
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,960
And this is what happens.

654
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,840
It's just, it's wonderful.

655
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,440
How's the, I actually, I haven't played it in a long time.

656
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,960
Didn't they do, they redid it.

657
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,400
Didn't they like remake a bunch of it?

658
01:03:35,469 --> 01:03:37,230
But that's the thing people say like,

659
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,150
oh, video games and playing with like people

660
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,590
and your friends and getting them calls.

661
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,000
Like that's the kind of shit

662
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,599
that you want to take away from that.

663
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:45,159
You know what I mean?

664
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,650
Even when I'm like 80 years old,

665
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,250
I will always remember that first,

666
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,730
like 25 minutes in Tactical Intervention.

667
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,050
I just will, I know I will

668
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:58,010
because it was fucking so unbelievable.

669
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,969
It was so ridiculous.

670
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:04,090
Is it, did it shut down?

671
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,769
Yeah, sorry, the server shut down.

672
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:06,250
That's too bad.

673
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:11,880
But let's continue through the video.

674
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,840
Here we go.

675
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:29,440
Oh, what the fuck is this, Jay?

676
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,400
Hold on, I'm not ready.

677
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,039
I'm not ready.

678
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,559
I need to fix this audio.

679
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,940
Deep fried star.

680
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,139
Audio, jeez.

681
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:47,019
Bring the master ball.

682
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:48,139
You're the driver.

683
01:04:48,139 --> 01:04:49,099
I'm wait, I'm driving.

684
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:56,190
Watch out, there's guys behind us.

685
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:57,230
How do I drive?

686
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,110
This car drives like a piece of shit.

687
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:01,550
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

688
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:02,989
Why do you get arrows pointing?

689
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,989
Yeah, why do I get the GPS?

690
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:05,869
You didn't get the GPS.

691
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:06,510
I'm getting out.

692
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,949
Somebody was still in the back, I remember.

693
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:15,070
Like the VIP is in the back seat.

694
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:25,980
The guy in the back seat wasn't even in the call.

695
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:30,139
He's just like, what am I supposed to do?

696
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:31,260
The game just released.

697
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,539
I don't know what the fuck to do.

698
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,000
I'm just watching some guy drive his car.

699
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,480
He was sitting in the back seat, just sitting there.

700
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,519
You are a fucking asshole.

701
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,760
This is the best thing ever.

702
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:53,960
It really is.

703
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,679
How's this guy doing?

704
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:55,400
He looks like he's-

705
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:55,880
Oh, boo!

706
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:58,199
He's just like looking at me, just beeping.

707
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:19,150
He blew out of the car and then back flipped.

708
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,230
He's alive.

709
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:36,809
The VIP is alive.

710
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:38,829
That makes no sense.

711
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:48,519
He's sitting on the dash.

712
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,159
This game, I can't take it anymore.

713
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:56,119
I got to get out of here.

714
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:56,760
Wait, what the hell?

715
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,159
That's the first, you got to get out of here.

716
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:06,570
People just gunned him down, surrounded him, and just started firing.

717
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,010
All right, I'm driving.

718
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:08,889
I'm going fast.

719
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:10,010
I got the need for speed.

720
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:13,210
Get out of the car.

721
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:14,650
Get out of the car.

722
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,210
There's two of the same guy holding their feet on the car.

723
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,849
There's two of the same guy with the feet on the dash.

724
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:37,449
I seriously am passing out.

725
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:39,289
You see the spoiler on the back of that car?

726
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,969
No, I'm too busy blacking out.

727
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:43,690
It just threw us into this game.

728
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:49,530
I remember, I remember I had to like go to bed after this.

729
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,800
This is one of those scenarios we played.

730
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,760
I don't know, this is like five minutes.

731
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,760
We probably played for like a couple hours, two, three hours maybe.

732
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,599
Maybe a little bit more.

733
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,329
And I distinctly remember like being hungover.

734
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,289
That happens to me.

735
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:03,690
It does.

736
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:07,880
I don't make that shit up.

737
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,940
Like when I laugh to a point where I fucking like start crying and shit.

738
01:08:13,099 --> 01:08:15,340
Like I like start to fade out.

739
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:21,390
I get like streaming video hungover.

740
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:22,989
I get like comedy hungover.

741
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,640
I really do.

742
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:30,479
Seriously, we were at the ready screen.

743
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:31,920
It got wicked loud.

744
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,430
That was just too much like too much stimulation.

745
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:39,310
The last time, the last time I faded out for real.

746
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:43,229
Actually truly faded out was during the Sims 4 mod night.

747
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:45,439
During the dog peeing shit.

748
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,199
Like the guy on drugs with his dogs.

749
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:55,340
That is the last time that I actually like got fucking video game hungover.

750
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:59,180
I just, the dog rolling around in its own piss and the guy on drugs

751
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,779
walking and walking the dog in his own house.

752
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,260
Like I was blacking out.

753
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,810
I came pretty close a few more times.

754
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,609
Like recently.

755
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:12,729
But then like that, I don't know.

756
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:14,489
Then like later on that night you just kind of,

757
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:18,170
you just like fucking god it feels like you just got run over by a car.

758
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:20,939
The farts and screams.

759
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,140
I didn't black out during that.

760
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,300
I started like welling up a little bit here.

761
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:31,369
But those mods, the first handful of those mods.

762
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:38,810
Oh, I'm about, I actually had eject, but I wasn't blacking out there.

763
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:43,789
I have a distinct memory of taking my headphones out.

764
01:09:43,789 --> 01:09:45,069
So I think I said it a few times.

765
01:09:45,069 --> 01:09:46,270
Like I have to leave the room.

766
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:46,989
I turned around.

767
01:09:46,989 --> 01:09:51,390
I like got out of the fucking chair and I like walked over here to just get away from the desk.

768
01:09:56,909 --> 01:09:57,789
I love this shit.

769
01:09:57,789 --> 01:10:03,180
Like it, it's got, it has to be constant laughter for a little while.

770
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:10,859
If you expel like enough laughter and you laugh enough and then you, you like get back.

771
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:15,020
But if something else happens that you see when you're in the middle of desperately trying

772
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:19,020
to come back, that's where you get like comedy injured.

773
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,640
You see something or something plays out in your head over and over again.

774
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:31,000
We, you think about it over and over again in your head of why you think it's so funny.

775
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,680
But it's, this is just reminds me and even from streams too.

776
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,960
This is just reminds me just how much fun some of this shit just truly is.

777
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,649
It, I fucking, I love this shit.

778
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:46,060
It's fucking so much fun.

779
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,409
Hyperventil laughing.

780
01:10:50,409 --> 01:10:53,850
Yeah, the laugh just keeps punching you.

781
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:55,369
How does this one end?

782
01:10:55,369 --> 01:10:56,010
Of the brain.

783
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,720
My old screen.

784
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:02,319
Subscribe for more like if you did.

785
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:04,960
If you did.

786
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,079
I only like if you did, if you liked.

787
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:11,130
If you didn't like it, then you didn't have to like it.

788
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,170
But I like if you did.

789
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:18,779
I hated that one.

790
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,460
Well, I hope you didn't like the video then.

791
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,289
Have I watched all stars videos?

792
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,970
Oh, I've seen every single one of his videos.

793
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:41,239
All right.

794
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:41,720
What's next?

795
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:47,279
German, no, no German rumble.

796
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,420
I feel like we've German rumble has been seen plenty of times.

797
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,779
I want to kind of revisit some of the old ones that like I don't,

798
01:11:54,779 --> 01:11:55,819
I haven't watched in a while.

799
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:04,460
Raven's cry.

800
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,939
Oh man, that's an old one.

801
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:10,619
Raven's cries.

802
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,409
Crazy.

803
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:14,409
Which one though, I did two videos on that game.

804
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,520
I made two Raven's cry videos because they've remade it.

805
01:12:31,949 --> 01:12:35,479
Wait, did I Raven's did?

806
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:38,359
Did I make two videos on Raven's cry?

807
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:39,479
Yeah, I say, yes, yes, yes, I did.

808
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:40,680
Okay, I tell you, I did.

809
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:48,729
This is Raven's cry is a finished game.

810
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:51,930
Be brave.

811
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:03,100
Oh, internet.

812
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:03,659
How are we doing?

813
01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:10,460
Ooh, not very good, it seems.

814
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:21,899
All right, let's add this.

815
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,220
Doink, doink.

816
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:33,710
Raven's cry.

817
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,680
What?

818
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,119
Why is this not playing here?

819
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:52,010
Oh, here we go.

820
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:55,760
That was weird.

821
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,600
All right, let's watch Raven's cry.

822
01:14:07,579 --> 01:14:10,380
Three, two, one, action.

823
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:19,760
This guy looks like he's waiting for a bus.

824
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:24,189
Get out of my way.

825
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:26,439
Get out of my way.

826
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:27,960
There's no need to be rude.

827
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,079
I was just.

828
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:30,279
It's the same person talking.

829
01:14:31,609 --> 01:14:32,489
I didn't even do that.

830
01:14:32,489 --> 01:14:33,369
I didn't even do that.

831
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:33,850
Why?

832
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:36,090
Yeah, half the audio wasn't recorded.

833
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,189
Uh-oh, there's pirates here waiting for me.

834
01:14:42,829 --> 01:14:45,229
And there's no, none of them.

835
01:14:45,229 --> 01:14:45,710
None of them.

836
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,310
You let them have the flag and here you stand.

837
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:48,750
Mind telling me how that's possible?

838
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,750
My name is Christopher Riddle.

839
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,109
My name is Batman.

840
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:52,829
Touch more ass.

841
01:14:52,829 --> 01:14:54,029
Remember that drunken asshole?

842
01:14:54,029 --> 01:14:54,670
We all know.

843
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:58,829
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:02,619
So what's next?

845
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,199
Turn it up.

846
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:13,630
All right.

847
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:18,189
This really does sound like it sounds like somebody was just at like a bar

848
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:21,470
drinking with their buddies and held a microphone in front of

849
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:23,149
some one of their friends was just like, hey, can you

850
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:28,880
can you do like a fucking shitty pirate voice for me?

851
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,119
Of course his asses.

852
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,119
All right, this swear guy is seriously driving me crazy.

853
01:15:41,609 --> 01:15:42,569
This is all he does.

854
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,970
There's a guy on this boat that's just saying a variation of the same insult.

855
01:15:50,329 --> 01:15:53,449
He's telling us to be brave and at the same sentence he's calling us names.

856
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:54,810
Which one is it?

857
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:04,539
We're sinking.

858
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:13,079
He's sinking.

859
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,140
Sinking into the sea.

860
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,340
We don't die today.

861
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,260
You bitches.

862
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,289
God damn it, man.

863
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:26,010
Well, first I'm going to stand and then I'm going to put them

864
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:28,890
and then we're going to put them again and then I'm going to put them again

865
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:31,210
and then I'm going to stand and then I'm going to stand.

866
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:42,090
Why does he keep telling me to do the fear skill?

867
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:44,890
I did not mean to shoot that guy.

868
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:45,689
Didn't mean to kill that guy.

869
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:46,329
I really didn't.

870
01:16:46,329 --> 01:16:47,609
I'm trying to do the fear skill.

871
01:16:48,569 --> 01:16:49,770
Nobody seems to care though.

872
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:50,729
Apparently that guy.

873
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:52,890
Nobody cares about that guy.

874
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:53,529
Everyone's cool.

875
01:16:53,529 --> 01:16:54,010
We're all right.

876
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:54,409
We're good.

877
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:58,779
Look, a guy sleeping on the dock.

878
01:16:58,779 --> 01:16:59,340
What do you know?

879
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:01,470
Hey, who's got a gun here?

880
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:02,270
You're going to put a gun on me?

881
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,069
Are you crazy, man?

882
01:17:03,069 --> 01:17:04,430
Let's see if you can put somebody's eye out.

883
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:04,989
I'm tired.

884
01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:06,109
I'm going back to bed.

885
01:17:06,109 --> 01:17:06,750
I think I'm good.

886
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:06,989
No, wait.

887
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:07,710
You've got a gun still.

888
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:08,350
Oh my god, dude.

889
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:09,630
You're going to kill somebody with that thing.

890
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:10,430
I'm sleepy.

891
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:10,829
I'm going back.

892
01:17:10,829 --> 01:17:11,949
I'm not tired anymore.

893
01:17:11,949 --> 01:17:12,989
You think I'm tired?

894
01:17:12,989 --> 01:17:14,029
No, I am tired.

895
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:15,869
No, I'm going to wake up now because you've got a gun.

896
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:17,069
This guy's crazy.

897
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:17,949
I'm tired again.

898
01:17:17,949 --> 01:17:18,750
No, I'm not tired.

899
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:19,470
You think I'm tired?

900
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:20,029
Fuck you.

901
01:17:20,029 --> 01:17:20,829
I'm tired again.

902
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:22,029
Oh, hey.

903
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:24,510
I don't want to fight these guys.

904
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,680
You quacks.

905
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,880
That's my favorite one.

906
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,439
My favorite one.

907
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:30,960
Be brave.

908
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,840
You quacks.

909
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,439
You quacks.

910
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,340
That's the best one.

911
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,840
That is absolutely the funniest one.

912
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:47,579
Dingy boat.

913
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:48,220
Why quacks?

914
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,979
These guys are shooting like 300.

915
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:50,939
Oh my god.

916
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:52,779
Be brave.

917
01:17:52,779 --> 01:17:53,260
Shit.

918
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,260
There's no way I'm going to be able to fight these guys.

919
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,739
I just like 2%.

920
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,819
I did like not even 1% damage.

921
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:01,340
We're like instantly getting killed.

922
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:03,439
I can't even turn the wheel.

923
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:06,810
It's all your fault.

924
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,250
You numbskull.

925
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:08,750
No.

926
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:15,930
Who's saying you need me?

927
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,199
Why is that the fucking reverse of yeah?

928
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:23,329
No.

929
01:18:25,609 --> 01:18:26,409
No.

930
01:18:26,409 --> 01:18:29,720
Oh shit, there's a prisoner in here.

931
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:31,609
Get me out of here.

932
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:35,340
That's not a very secure prison.

933
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,359
Excuse me.

934
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:39,399
Just go the other way.

935
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:43,399
I don't even know what that means.

936
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:45,319
You just said a nonsense statement.

937
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:46,359
Just please go out the door.

938
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:47,960
Get on your way.

939
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:48,460
Go.

940
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:52,279
I'm going to block this side of the door so you have to fucking go this way.

941
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:54,539
Go.

942
01:18:57,210 --> 01:18:58,090
Turd sniffer.

943
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,329
You just call me a turd sniffer?

944
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:08,810
They're all like bumbling all over each other and like saying excuse me and I go

945
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:09,529
I don't want any trouble.

946
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,720
God dude, this is I can't beat this.

947
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,140
I can't beat this like hen house.

948
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,060
That's all I hear.

949
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:35,420
Somebody just said discord voice chat.

950
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:45,069
That's all I hear.

951
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:48,430
There's literally only I that's all I fucking hear right now.

952
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:50,439
It's making me want to die.

953
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:53,260
Go go go go go.

954
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,239
Oh discord voice chat.

955
01:19:58,239 --> 01:19:59,920
Please tell me I got out of that nightmare.

956
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,279
That's so fucking funny.

957
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:06,460
You cannot be serious right now.

958
01:20:07,579 --> 01:20:08,859
Hey I'm going to try.

959
01:20:08,859 --> 01:20:10,140
Hey let's go to voice one.

960
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,140
Voice one.

961
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:12,939
Anybody in here?

962
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:49,609
Crash my computer.

963
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:59,119
My computer is locked up right now.

964
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,640
Mine too.

965
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,439
Who crashed all of our computers?

966
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,359
My discord I my computer is locked up right now.

967
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:30,720
I'm still stuck here.

968
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:44,189
I have I have I can't do anything.

969
01:21:44,189 --> 01:21:46,010
Okay anyways.

970
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,060
That's so funny.

971
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,819
No joke dad somebody fucking broke the discord with.

972
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,479
Serious right now.

973
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,880
I can't believe that somebody just broke the discord.

974
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,600
What if it just shuts down forever?

975
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,720
What if we never get it back?

976
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:20,300
Wait a second.

977
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,020
Don't even tell me.

978
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:23,340
Oh yeah people just peed.

979
01:22:23,979 --> 01:22:25,659
People just pee in bushes.

980
01:22:25,659 --> 01:22:27,979
No I forgot about this.

981
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:29,979
Yeah this is a lady pissing into a bush.

982
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:32,619
I completely forgot that people would just pee.

983
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:33,979
God they keep tempting me.

984
01:22:33,979 --> 01:22:35,340
Stop tempting me with this.

985
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:36,619
Come on.

986
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,359
I like people just peed.

987
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:41,279
They keep putting them in the perfect spot

988
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:43,199
for you to push them off the giant scaffolding.

989
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:48,000
Do you have any idea how hard it is to not do that?

990
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:49,039
Look again.

991
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:50,720
And this guy this guy's pissing.

992
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:53,850
No he's not.

993
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:54,729
What is this guy doing?

994
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:55,609
He's puking right.

995
01:22:57,659 --> 01:22:58,779
Oh he's throwing up.

996
01:22:58,779 --> 01:23:00,380
He's throwing up into an invisible ground.

997
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:04,569
That was mean.

998
01:23:05,289 --> 01:23:06,329
That was me I got sick.

999
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:08,090
He was ill.

1000
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:10,489
Wait was that the guy I was supposed to talk to?

1001
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:16,239
You guys notice something?

1002
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,479
Anything seem a little off to you guys at all?

1003
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:22,680
Just listen.

1004
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:31,119
They patched him out of the game.

1005
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,390
The last clip you saw was like two and a half days ago.

1006
01:23:35,949 --> 01:23:38,989
They removed this is all new dialogue on the boat.

1007
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:40,989
Anytime you go on the boat now it's this.

1008
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,789
What were the patch notes?

1009
01:23:43,789 --> 01:23:46,989
Did they say like oh we removed these scream swears be brave guy.

1010
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:51,390
We apologize for his uncalled for insults.

1011
01:23:52,189 --> 01:23:53,149
And he has been removed.

1012
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:53,789
I want him back.

1013
01:23:54,350 --> 01:23:55,229
Where is he?

1014
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:57,310
He was an integral part of my crew.

1015
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:00,590
He was he was like the bet they just they patched him up.

1016
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,399
I remember because I was recording over like a few days here.

1017
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:08,840
Like it's probably like I typically would play the game for like a few hours.

1018
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:11,239
Take out some things that I thought were fun.

1019
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:12,920
Play for like another hour or two the next day.

1020
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:16,600
Or take edit some stuff together and be making the kind of the video as it went along.

1021
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:23,119
And it just they changed the game like halfway through when I was making the video.

1022
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,020
It was really weird.

1023
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:38,029
Scare Saturdays.

1024
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:44,350
Let me go over here.

1025
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:50,909
Rat Burger.

1026
01:24:50,909 --> 01:24:52,270
We'll do we'll do Rat Burger.

1027
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,109
Rat Burgers and I haven't seen that one in a long time either.

1028
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:07,069
Let's see.

1029
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:11,840
Welcome to Rat.

1030
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,079
Five more than five years ago.

1031
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:18,079
This was May March 18th 2014.

1032
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,119
This is five years ago now.

1033
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:24,779
That's a long long time ago.

1034
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:25,819
I was just a young man.

1035
01:25:37,149 --> 01:25:43,760
I was just a young boy back then.

1036
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,460
This like that.

1037
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:57,869
Okay let's take a look.

1038
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:00,090
Rat Burger.

1039
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:06,239
29 is still young adult.

1040
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,680
Haven't you guys played Alter Ego?

1041
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,119
I know haven't you played Alter Ego?

1042
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,319
Hi.

1043
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:24,109
Where do we make the cheeseburgers?

1044
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:29,079
I love how we each have a different.

1045
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:30,760
All right wait wait wait wait wait stealth.

1046
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,199
No no no no no do not just stop.

1047
01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:33,560
This is what he's doing.

1048
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,199
That's not me.

1049
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:34,840
Oh shit.

1050
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:38,039
Why are you star's girlfriend?

1051
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:38,520
No no.

1052
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:40,520
I thought we were doing the tape.

1053
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:40,920
Oh yeah.

1054
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:43,800
All right.

1055
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:48,600
Something important to note here is this game was so early in its development.

1056
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,720
It was like a super alpha.

1057
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:52,439
There was no restart.

1058
01:26:52,439 --> 01:27:02,029
There was no redo game or put the do a do a reset or you had to physically everyone had

1059
01:27:02,029 --> 01:27:05,310
to close the game to get these cheeseburgers back up here on the shelf.

1060
01:27:06,569 --> 01:27:08,649
You had to close everyone had to close out their games.

1061
01:27:08,649 --> 01:27:13,289
Everyone had to restart their games and the process to get anybody into a server was

1062
01:27:13,289 --> 01:27:15,130
this crazy roundabout.

1063
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:17,449
There was like three servers that existed I think in the whole game.

1064
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:23,130
It was a unity browser game that was hard to get people in multiplayer.

1065
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:27,819
So it was this was very hard.

1066
01:27:27,819 --> 01:27:31,180
This took us like I remember like this like two hours had gone by at this point

1067
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:34,380
and we finally fucking got it and got it to work and we were all ready to like record.

1068
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:38,829
Remember if you fucked it up we had to do the whole thing again.

1069
01:27:38,829 --> 01:27:43,130
So like that's why I'm like don't don't don't what the fuck are you doing please.

1070
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:46,279
Just because that we would have to start over.

1071
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:47,960
Didn't star wake up in the middle of his sleep.

1072
01:27:48,039 --> 01:27:50,600
Yeah I I we needed a fourth person.

1073
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:53,399
So I just like hit up star like I texted him.

1074
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:56,359
I'm like hey dude come play this burger game it's gonna be fun.

1075
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:58,359
He was asleep and I was like come on play this game please.

1076
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,720
And I woke him up I didn't dead sleep.

1077
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:05,640
And within I don't know maybe like 30 minutes or 20 minutes of being awake.

1078
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,119
I was like we're trying to multiplayer just get in here's like the server is

1079
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:11,159
what you have to do and he was just barely awake at this point.

1080
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:21,520
Start over.

1081
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,130
Hi.

1082
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,609
He just didn't want to be here at all and he didn't give a fuck if he was

1083
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:26,489
gonna fuck it all up.

1084
01:28:27,449 --> 01:28:29,770
So what's the first thing he does.

1085
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:31,529
I love how we each have a different.

1086
01:28:31,529 --> 01:28:33,210
All right wait wait wait wait wait wait stealth.

1087
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:36,010
No no no no no do not just stop this is what he's doing.

1088
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:36,649
That's not me.

1089
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:37,369
Oh shit.

1090
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,489
Why are you star's girlfriend?

1091
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:40,970
No no no.

1092
01:28:45,289 --> 01:28:46,329
He's just doing his own thing.

1093
01:28:46,329 --> 01:28:47,369
So I can't control.

1094
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:51,050
He's just okay star is just doing his own thing this whole video.

1095
01:28:51,979 --> 01:28:55,819
He's just like not even in this video he's just doing his own thing.

1096
01:28:57,279 --> 01:28:58,720
Hold his mouth sensitivity.

1097
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,720
You have to turn your like DPI down.

1098
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,920
I can't fight my mouth.

1099
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:03,920
So high.

1100
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:10,079
All right you are seriously you are seriously messing this whole thing up you guys.

1101
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:13,039
We were supposed to build burgers you guys are just taking all the ingredients

1102
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:14,640
and throwing them all over the place.

1103
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,239
We got people coming on the floor.

1104
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:17,119
We have customers.

1105
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,800
I'm going to say hi.

1106
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,920
Look you need to look at like the note board to see what we have to do.

1107
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:29,760
I'm just watching star like literally just hold his hands out and just hold left to right.

1108
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:33,439
What are you doing?

1109
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:37,800
I'm trying to fix it.

1110
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,520
You have just like single-handedly destroyed what we were doing.

1111
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,680
Can we actually make a burger or are you guys just going to be dipshits this whole time?

1112
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,439
Look at come out here you sprint you can sprint.

1113
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:59,550
I had this grand idea that we were going to have like a burger contest and

1114
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,869
do some maybe like some light RP right.

1115
01:30:03,869 --> 01:30:08,079
They were just fucking throwing shit on the grill.

1116
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,979
I had this like this grand idea.

1117
01:30:14,779 --> 01:30:19,680
Girl are you guys just going to be dipshits this whole time?

1118
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,439
Look at come out here you sprint you can sprint.

1119
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:26,829
I figured I'd just change the field of view.

1120
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:28,590
There are people out here looking for cheeseburgers.

1121
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:29,630
This guy wants a bacon burger.

1122
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:30,989
All right we gotta we gotta set this up.

1123
01:30:30,989 --> 01:30:32,109
This guy wants a bacon burger.

1124
01:30:32,109 --> 01:30:32,670
This guy wants.

1125
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:34,109
There's so many people in here.

1126
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,159
There is a burger patty.

1127
01:30:45,159 --> 01:30:46,039
She's not happy.

1128
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:48,199
All right who wanted the lettuce?

1129
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:55,159
No nobody will all right seriously meeting team meeting team meeting.

1130
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,560
Oh the manager is displeased.

1131
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,439
I am not happy.

1132
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:00,840
You guys one of you guys is getting fired.

1133
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,479
Hey look at all this stuff on the grill.

1134
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:05,279
Yeah it's all burnt.

1135
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:06,800
Go to the front desk go to the front.

1136
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:07,520
I got a burger.

1137
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:10,319
Wait what do you mean what are you talking about?

1138
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:21,630
He took the patty.

1139
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:22,590
Catch it someone.

1140
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:22,989
Catch it.

1141
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:24,350
I caught it.

1142
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,430
She's still there.

1143
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:29,310
Where's my burger?

1144
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,189
Oh he snagged it.

1145
01:31:32,189 --> 01:31:34,189
Oh no this look at look at this trail of rats.

1146
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:37,390
They're all it's like a rat fight.

1147
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:38,989
They're all going after this one piece of meat.

1148
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:41,630
This one guy.

1149
01:31:42,909 --> 01:31:43,789
Don't let them get away.

1150
01:31:44,989 --> 01:31:46,989
We are chasing this rat all the way down the street.

1151
01:31:48,489 --> 01:31:49,850
Come here you son of a bitch.

1152
01:31:51,609 --> 01:31:51,930
I got it.

1153
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:52,649
I don't think you can.

1154
01:31:52,649 --> 01:31:53,770
I got the rat.

1155
01:31:58,569 --> 01:31:59,850
Look at all these people just watching.

1156
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:02,250
I caught the wrong one.

1157
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,010
Can we actually play this game?

1158
01:32:05,529 --> 01:32:06,170
We're not.

1159
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:07,369
Hold on.

1160
01:32:07,369 --> 01:32:08,409
Everyone get in the back.

1161
01:32:08,409 --> 01:32:09,449
These rats are burned.

1162
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:10,890
They are crisp.

1163
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:16,060
They're not even they're dead.

1164
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:16,539
They're black.

1165
01:32:16,539 --> 01:32:18,779
Hey guys it's okay we can finish the rat burger.

1166
01:32:18,779 --> 01:32:19,579
I found the patty.

1167
01:32:19,579 --> 01:32:20,939
These rats are burned.

1168
01:32:20,939 --> 01:32:22,220
Get the rat and put it on the bun.

1169
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:29,789
I'm crying right now.

1170
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:33,439
This is so stupid.

1171
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:36,479
Okay can we please restart this and just like I don't have any

1172
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:38,640
fucking rats everywhere.

1173
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,720
I don't even know how you draw.

1174
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,560
Like how do you like even control this?

1175
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,800
I think it screws up in multiplayer.

1176
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:52,960
And then that's did I just.

1177
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,640
It looks like that's two-year-old drawing.

1178
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,880
You're holding two.

1179
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,720
All right so.

1180
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,079
All right no no follow me though.

1181
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:02,159
There is a prisoner back here.

1182
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:03,039
There's a person back here.

1183
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:04,800
Oh my god you fucking idiot.

1184
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,680
What are you doing?

1185
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,119
We just remade this game.

1186
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:09,199
Remember keep in mind.

1187
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,359
Keep in mind we just started this again.

1188
01:33:12,079 --> 01:33:17,550
This was like a all right three two one let's go right.

1189
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,390
Immediately the first thing he fucking does.

1190
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:21,310
We were been this not even two minutes.

1191
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,750
A prisoner back here.

1192
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:23,630
There's a person back.

1193
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:25,470
Oh my god you fucking idiot.

1194
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:26,270
What are you doing?

1195
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:28,109
We just remade this game.

1196
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:33,930
You're fired.

1197
01:33:35,229 --> 01:33:35,789
There's a person.

1198
01:33:35,789 --> 01:33:36,909
What's this a guy in here?

1199
01:33:36,909 --> 01:33:38,590
I know that's what I was saying.

1200
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:39,470
What's wrong with this guy?

1201
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:42,399
Can we like punch him?

1202
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:43,840
He is the rat mama.

1203
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:45,199
Can I pick him up?

1204
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:46,720
What if you could pick him up and like.

1205
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,239
You make like a person sandwich.

1206
01:33:49,579 --> 01:33:51,100
No I oh no.

1207
01:33:51,739 --> 01:33:53,659
All right you can lock people in.

1208
01:33:53,659 --> 01:33:56,859
No we all conspired against you.

1209
01:33:56,859 --> 01:33:58,460
Yeah it's just like all at once.

1210
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,659
I am completely locked.

1211
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:05,420
There's no way I'm getting out of this.

1212
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:06,939
We did that very silently.

1213
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:07,739
We all knew.

1214
01:34:07,739 --> 01:34:08,539
You dicks.

1215
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:10,060
It's just me and like.

1216
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,260
Is it like let us bricks.

1217
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:12,220
I don't know what that's supposed to be.

1218
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,100
He's like fighting through the trouble.

1219
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,300
I'm fighting through.

1220
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,739
Also we're wearing bandanas and.

1221
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:26,859
Again take three.

1222
01:34:28,859 --> 01:34:30,779
Okay star you're not allowed to look.

1223
01:34:31,659 --> 01:34:32,619
Not allowed to look.

1224
01:34:32,619 --> 01:34:33,979
No because you're the burger judge.

1225
01:34:33,979 --> 01:34:34,939
There's people coming in.

1226
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:35,739
There's customers.

1227
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:38,060
Do you see what I did here.

1228
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,060
This is some fucking 4D chess.

1229
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:41,420
Star you're the judge.

1230
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:42,779
You have to be on the other side.

1231
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:45,819
You have to be on the other side.

1232
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:46,619
Not in the kitchen.

1233
01:34:48,329 --> 01:34:49,529
That's some yeah.

1234
01:34:49,529 --> 01:34:50,890
I made sure to get him out of the kitchen.

1235
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,869
No because you're the burger judge.

1236
01:34:53,869 --> 01:34:54,829
There's people coming in.

1237
01:34:54,829 --> 01:34:55,630
There's customers.

1238
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:57,069
I'll talk the people down.

1239
01:34:57,069 --> 01:34:58,510
You got to show them to their seats.

1240
01:34:58,510 --> 01:35:00,109
I'll lower their expectation.

1241
01:35:00,109 --> 01:35:01,229
Lower their expectations.

1242
01:35:01,229 --> 01:35:02,510
Because they're going to probably throw up.

1243
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:03,550
After eating one of our burgers.

1244
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:05,390
I'm going to go.

1245
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,109
You look mad.

1246
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:07,550
Oh I picked something up.

1247
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:08,829
Yeah still we have to make burgers.

1248
01:35:08,829 --> 01:35:10,510
We have to make our own delicious cheese.

1249
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:12,510
You must be proud of yourself.

1250
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:13,390
All right my second rule.

1251
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:14,590
Start with the bun.

1252
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:17,550
And hey I have everyone get away from each other.

1253
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:18,909
Because we're just going to knock into stuff.

1254
01:35:18,909 --> 01:35:20,350
I'll take my stuff into the bathroom.

1255
01:35:22,189 --> 01:35:25,390
So here's my burger station is going to be right next to the sink.

1256
01:35:27,069 --> 01:35:28,189
In the bathroom.

1257
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:29,630
Yeah I'll be I'll be in the bathroom.

1258
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:31,149
You can use the bad controller.

1259
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:34,109
Oh well the cheese is completely.

1260
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:36,909
My cheese seriously is just like a black tile.

1261
01:35:36,909 --> 01:35:37,949
You don't put the cheese on the grill.

1262
01:35:37,949 --> 01:35:38,909
I wanted to like melt it.

1263
01:35:38,909 --> 01:35:40,590
You don't put the cheese.

1264
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:41,789
You can put cheese on the grill.

1265
01:35:41,789 --> 01:35:42,989
Hey well get out of my station.

1266
01:35:42,989 --> 01:35:44,270
You can put cheese on the grill.

1267
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:44,829
You.

1268
01:35:44,829 --> 01:35:45,310
No you can't.

1269
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:45,630
Can you?

1270
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:45,949
Sick.

1271
01:35:48,829 --> 01:35:49,789
Son of a bitch.

1272
01:35:49,789 --> 01:35:52,189
He just dropped my burger in the fucking sink.

1273
01:35:53,229 --> 01:35:55,630
Hey hey you don't got to you got to play to win.

1274
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:56,109
Oh my.

1275
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,239
Star just pretend like you didn't hear that.

1276
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,920
It's a Krabby Patty.

1277
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,359
What are you doing back here?

1278
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:07,119
How are you like multiplying these bacons?

1279
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,279
Star come back here.

1280
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:11,119
One come back here.

1281
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:11,760
What's going on?

1282
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,760
I know how to break everything.

1283
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:14,399
Where are you?

1284
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:16,079
It's like duping the back room.

1285
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:17,119
He's duping.

1286
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,560
What the hell?

1287
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,949
How did you get all this baconator?

1288
01:36:21,949 --> 01:36:23,470
I'm the baconator.

1289
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:24,510
Who's under the ground?

1290
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:25,550
Jerma you're under the ground.

1291
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:26,430
What the fuck?

1292
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:27,149
Oh no.

1293
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:32,270
We didn't get to do the thing I wanted to do.

1294
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:33,149
I'm so hard on this.

1295
01:36:35,149 --> 01:36:35,649
Where am I?

1296
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:39,630
Somebody else fell.

1297
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:40,510
Somebody else fell.

1298
01:36:42,909 --> 01:36:45,310
You're gonna see the tiny little guy fall.

1299
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:46,189
Who just fell?

1300
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,800
You went whizzing by my screen.

1301
01:36:52,329 --> 01:36:52,829
Yeah.

1302
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:58,010
I wanted to make like cheeseburgers and have a cheeseburger contest.

1303
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:08,090
Apparently not though.

1304
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:11,369
Jerma is he's reliving his frustrations.

1305
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:15,100
He's doing it all over again.

1306
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,699
He's seeing why he was so angry.

1307
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:20,800
Spy party.

1308
01:37:27,869 --> 01:37:29,710
What about the New Vegas time gun?

1309
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:34,039
I haven't seen that in a long time but that one that was fucking crazy.

1310
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:39,689
Fun facts for everybody here.

1311
01:37:39,689 --> 01:37:41,850
If you're a new viewer to the stream that is

1312
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:48,729
that is one of the first streams I ever did moving to Twitch.

1313
01:37:50,909 --> 01:37:51,630
Very early.

1314
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:55,149
I think that was had to been the first five to ten streams ever right?

1315
01:37:57,020 --> 01:37:59,819
It's another one of those where I start to not be able to breathe.

1316
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,300
I can't control myself.

1317
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:04,329
Let's try.

1318
01:38:04,329 --> 01:38:04,890
Let's watch it.

1319
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:09,119
Didn't you stream Minecraft in like 2012?

1320
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:10,399
No I had like a Twitch account.

1321
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:13,039
I had like an old Twitch account and I would use it sometimes.

1322
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:17,279
I streamed on YouTube sometimes but it wasn't until like 2014

1323
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:21,520
that I moved and started doing Twitch seriously.

1324
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:25,199
Like taking it very seriously and streaming three or four times a week

1325
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,680
and that was like late 2014 I think right?

1326
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,600
YouTube streaming.

1327
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,279
Yeah it wasn't very good when I was doing it.

1328
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:37,279
That's why I chose to do Twitch instead.

1329
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,000
Internet come on.

1330
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:48,189
Let's close this.

1331
01:38:53,069 --> 01:38:54,189
My title changed right?

1332
01:38:59,449 --> 01:39:02,569
Yeah I'm just making sure the title actually changed.

1333
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:03,369
All right what was it gonna do?

1334
01:39:03,369 --> 01:39:06,699
We're gonna do this one.

1335
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:12,750
Stop.

1336
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:21,149
There we go.

1337
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:24,760
Stop.

1338
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,479
Stop wasting my time.

1339
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:43,100
All right here we go.

1340
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,060
This is all streamed.

1341
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:49,850
So this is gonna be so I'm so I streamed this at a low bit rate too.

1342
01:39:50,909 --> 01:39:55,210
This is back like 2500 I think bit rate.

1343
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:01,850
I stream now at 6000.

1344
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:06,409
So this is old bit rate that was pulled and made into a video

1345
01:40:06,409 --> 01:40:10,729
now being streamed through through Twitch again

1346
01:40:11,609 --> 01:40:14,250
with like shitty internet problems today.

1347
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,760
This is gonna be interesting.

1348
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,560
We'll see how this looks.

1349
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:18,729
Here we go.

1350
01:40:18,729 --> 01:40:23,319
Ready?

1351
01:40:23,319 --> 01:40:25,880
Oh wait I know you're gonna hear that line like four times

1352
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:32,619
but hold on let me is this god damn it.

1353
01:40:32,619 --> 01:40:34,859
I knew it was frozen for I knew it was frozen.

1354
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,159
I knew it was frozen.

1355
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:44,539
There we go.

1356
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:47,500
No don't be frozen please.

1357
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:58,140
Sorry sometimes when I interact with a browser it freezes the whole thing.

1358
01:40:59,579 --> 01:41:17,119
I don't know why.

1359
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:21,819
Okay all right there we go.

1360
01:41:23,149 --> 01:41:29,039
Finally put it on the screen.

1361
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:31,520
Geez that took fucking long enough.

1362
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,479
Here we go.

1363
01:41:36,439 --> 01:41:37,720
Go waste Jason's.

1364
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:49,850
Fuck you I came here for a mission and I'm gonna do my mission.

1365
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:52,090
You fucking ghouls.

1366
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:53,449
So should I just fucking kill this guy?

1367
01:41:55,739 --> 01:41:56,220
You got it.

1368
01:41:58,359 --> 01:41:58,920
I missed.

1369
01:42:00,439 --> 01:42:02,920
Oh don't don't don't don't go sir.

1370
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,680
I was just playing with you.

1371
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,439
I just didn't want you to know that this was coming for you.

1372
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:17,149
You can run but you can't hide.

1373
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:20,010
Let's get in it.

1374
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:22,329
Also very important to note.

1375
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:23,850
This is important to note.

1376
01:42:25,449 --> 01:42:29,369
This is the first time I've played Fallout New Vegas and I just I was just fucking killing people.

1377
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:35,239
I just was like slaughtering people.

1378
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:39,529
And I didn't know I never ended up finishing Fallout New Vegas.

1379
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:49,159
Because I got to a point where I was spawning 500 easy peets and I couldn't play it anymore.

1380
01:42:49,159 --> 01:42:51,560
I couldn't do I could I can't play Skyrim anymore either.

1381
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:58,720
I've said it before of any time someone's like hey cheat like put that add this do this.

1382
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:03,199
At some point you just you've ruined the whole thing and you can never play the game normal ever again.

1383
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:09,050
Step in that asshole Larry.

1384
01:43:09,689 --> 01:43:11,449
Step inside that asshole Larry.

1385
01:43:11,449 --> 01:43:13,289
I'm so lost in here.

1386
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,039
Where the fuck do I go?

1387
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:18,960
Everything's the same.

1388
01:43:20,829 --> 01:43:22,109
God help me.

1389
01:43:22,109 --> 01:43:22,989
Derma blind.

1390
01:43:22,989 --> 01:43:23,789
Derma blind.

1391
01:43:23,789 --> 01:43:24,189
Blind.

1392
01:43:24,189 --> 01:43:25,229
My computers.

1393
01:43:25,229 --> 01:43:27,149
If I touch a computer it'll save me.

1394
01:43:27,149 --> 01:43:29,869
Oh my fucking god I'm just gonna throw everything in the trash.

1395
01:43:29,869 --> 01:43:30,909
I don't fucking even care.

1396
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:32,750
No I need that.

1397
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:34,670
I need my space suit back.

1398
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,359
Did I lose the space suit?

1399
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:40,239
Where's the space suit?

1400
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:40,720
Where'd it go?

1401
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:44,189
Fuck.

1402
01:43:44,189 --> 01:43:46,430
Did George Washington take shortcuts?

1403
01:43:48,029 --> 01:43:53,529
Did Bill Gates?

1404
01:43:53,529 --> 01:43:54,810
I couldn't think of another person.

1405
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:59,420
Took me that long to think of another successful person.

1406
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,779
No they didn't.

1407
01:44:04,779 --> 01:44:12,680
Did Christopher Columbus take a shortcut?

1408
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:16,060
No they didn't.

1409
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:17,260
I should have taken this shortcut.

1410
01:44:17,899 --> 01:44:19,180
I should have taken this shortcut.

1411
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:20,220
Fuck George Washington.

1412
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,420
I should have taken the shortcut.

1413
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:22,539
I should have taken the shortcut.

1414
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:26,109
Should have taken the fucking shortcut.

1415
01:44:26,829 --> 01:44:29,689
I'm scared the fuck out of here.

1416
01:44:30,909 --> 01:44:32,189
Oh I had no clip to the door.

1417
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:33,069
There it is I found it.

1418
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:34,670
I think I found it.

1419
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:39,310
Yeah I think it's this way.

1420
01:44:40,029 --> 01:44:40,670
Where is it?

1421
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,430
Uh oh it's down that way.

1422
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:42,989
To the left.

1423
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:44,350
Up into the right.

1424
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,210
I think it's right over here.

1425
01:44:48,569 --> 01:44:49,689
How do I get a better view?

1426
01:44:50,329 --> 01:44:50,890
Oh I know.

1427
01:44:55,850 --> 01:44:56,729
See I already lost it.

1428
01:44:56,729 --> 01:44:56,970
It's over.

1429
01:44:56,970 --> 01:44:58,810
I can't play the game the same ever again.

1430
01:44:58,810 --> 01:45:00,140
I can't get a better view.

1431
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:11,949
The first step is always no clip.

1432
01:45:11,949 --> 01:45:12,350
That's true.

1433
01:45:13,149 --> 01:45:14,270
That's always the first step.

1434
01:45:19,069 --> 01:45:20,430
Yep let's go.

1435
01:45:27,079 --> 01:45:28,680
Yeah give him a speech.

1436
01:45:40,569 --> 01:45:41,930
Dynamite joke incoming.

1437
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,600
Oh you couldn't even interact with it.

1438
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:50,960
Holy shit that's wicked loud.

1439
01:45:53,659 --> 01:45:55,020
Look at how loud this is.

1440
01:45:57,659 --> 01:45:58,460
Are you serious?

1441
01:46:00,539 --> 01:46:01,659
That's so loud.

1442
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:05,100
Holy shit.

1443
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,060
Wait what?

1444
01:46:10,029 --> 01:46:11,470
No it's no cheating.

1445
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:13,149
No I just I saw it.

1446
01:46:13,149 --> 01:46:13,550
I just want to see.

1447
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:13,949
I want to look.

1448
01:46:13,949 --> 01:46:14,510
I just want to take a look.

1449
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:15,390
I just want to see what's in there.

1450
01:46:16,189 --> 01:46:21,949
This is where it goes off the rails.

1451
01:46:21,949 --> 01:46:23,069
This is an odd picture.

1452
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,600
Why is this behind a locked door?

1453
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:32,109
Some random guy singing to one person in the audience.

1454
01:46:32,109 --> 01:46:34,350
And his clone is sitting in this seat smoking.

1455
01:46:35,069 --> 01:46:36,409
What a secret.

1456
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:40,159
What a fucking secret huh?

1457
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,359
Is this right?

1458
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:43,680
Here it comes.

1459
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:44,479
Somebody just put one in.

1460
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:47,789
I'm gonna believe this guy.

1461
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:03,130
Spawn this Jerma.

1462
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:04,010
Spawn this.

1463
01:47:04,010 --> 01:47:05,210
This will help you.

1464
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:08,010
And then it's just it's always easy peeps.

1465
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:13,789
Oh this is where.

1466
01:47:13,789 --> 01:47:15,310
Didn't I notice that they're funny?

1467
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:31,920
This was so funny.

1468
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:39,710
I cry a lot it seems.

1469
01:47:43,579 --> 01:48:01,100
Oh look at the guy in the back.

1470
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:05,899
They turn like they get torn through like four dimensions.

1471
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,430
Look at his eyes.

1472
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:12,750
Look at this one's fucking eyes.

1473
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:25,520
Why is this happening?

1474
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:27,279
Why was this happening?

1475
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:30,779
I lost all control.

1476
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:39,720
Oh my god.

1477
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:42,729
I forgot how heinous this was.

1478
01:48:46,279 --> 01:48:48,359
Why are they exploding?

1479
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:49,880
I don't know.

1480
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:50,920
I don't get it.

1481
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:51,880
I don't get it.

1482
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:53,579
Stop.

1483
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,220
Stop.

1484
01:48:59,079 --> 01:49:00,600
I don't it's too laggy.

1485
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:01,880
It's a little too laggy.

1486
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:03,960
They're hurting.

1487
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:04,600
That hurt.

1488
01:49:05,239 --> 01:49:06,439
That hurt.

1489
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:08,039
That hurt.

1490
01:49:08,039 --> 01:49:08,600
Stop.

1491
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:09,100
Stop.

1492
01:49:24,119 --> 01:49:24,680
What was that?

1493
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:25,479
That's not easy Pete.

1494
01:49:26,199 --> 01:49:27,239
That's not easy Pete.

1495
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,560
This is not easy Pete.

1496
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:34,649
Oh fuck.

1497
01:49:35,449 --> 01:49:36,409
Oh fuck.

1498
01:49:36,409 --> 01:49:37,850
Who is the flamethrower?

1499
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:39,449
That's not easy Pete either.

1500
01:49:39,449 --> 01:49:40,569
That's not easy Pete.

1501
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:43,520
Oh god he's naked.

1502
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,079
Nudity.

1503
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,439
Oh god nudity.

1504
01:49:59,789 --> 01:50:02,590
A second time and he turns.

1505
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:05,630
It's almost like.

1506
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:07,630
It's almost like this is a weapon.

1507
01:50:08,510 --> 01:50:11,949
You remember the Bart Simpson game where you had that thing to show that people were aliens?

1508
01:50:13,579 --> 01:50:14,300
It was like that.

1509
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,060
It was like I had to hit that guy twice with the show me you're an alien weapon.

1510
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:22,029
That's not easy Pete.

1511
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:26,810
Fucking not funny.

1512
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:30,409
I swear to god if this guy turns into like a fucking cheese pizza when I kill him I'm gonna die.

1513
01:50:31,369 --> 01:50:36,350
Oh no I'm at zero.

1514
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,239
Are we good?

1515
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:41,260
Oh god this is.

1516
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:41,659
Uh oh.

1517
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,680
Have we reached the end?

1518
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:47,449
We may have reached the end of the.

1519
01:50:47,449 --> 01:50:48,890
We're at the end of the line here.

1520
01:50:48,890 --> 01:51:01,289
I think we're okay.

1521
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:04,170
I think we're okay.

1522
01:51:06,890 --> 01:51:08,170
I think we were right here.

1523
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:09,850
Oh god.

1524
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:10,409
Yeah we're right here.

1525
01:51:10,409 --> 01:51:10,890
Nudity.

1526
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:12,010
Because I said this thing.

1527
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:14,350
Ah nah nah nah.

1528
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:14,909
Hold on hold on.

1529
01:51:15,789 --> 01:51:17,369
Uh oh.

1530
01:51:17,369 --> 01:51:21,369
Well if we go out completely then they're supposed to fix this tomorrow

1531
01:51:21,369 --> 01:51:22,329
and I'm gonna let them do it.

1532
01:51:22,329 --> 01:51:23,289
I won't be live tomorrow.

1533
01:51:23,289 --> 01:51:24,409
Let's just let them do it.

1534
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,520
And we'll come back again.

1535
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,399
I'm hoping that I don't have to.

1536
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:34,220
We're getting a lot of red.

1537
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:37,579
I'm sincerely hoping that I don't have to spend more than one day trying to get them

1538
01:51:37,579 --> 01:51:40,380
because he said that they were gonna get on this tomorrow.

1539
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:42,460
So hopefully I can go Tuesday.

1540
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,560
Just in case we cut out completely.

1541
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:51,579
Here we go.

1542
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:04,939
Okay that was not easy Pete.

1543
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:06,539
That was not easy Pete.

1544
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,359
It's never fucking not funny.

1545
01:52:11,359 --> 01:52:14,560
I swear to god if this guy turns into like a fucking cheese pizza when I kill him I'm

1546
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:14,960
gonna die.

1547
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,039
They do don't they?

1548
01:52:18,039 --> 01:52:18,600
I forget.

1549
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:24,090
Oh yeah they oh yes they do.

1550
01:52:27,579 --> 01:52:30,380
They just turned into a fucking museum statue.

1551
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,319
Look at this.

1552
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:38,199
Look at this guy's face.

1553
01:52:38,199 --> 01:52:39,640
Look at this guy's face.

1554
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,199
Oh yeah.

1555
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,720
He's like oh fuck.

1556
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,520
He can't believe it.

1557
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:45,880
He can't fucking believe it.

1558
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,119
This is unreal.

1559
01:52:57,529 --> 01:52:59,050
This shit is fucking unreal.

1560
01:52:59,050 --> 01:53:00,489
It's a time gun.

1561
01:53:01,449 --> 01:53:02,649
I just don't I don't have any words.

1562
01:53:02,649 --> 01:53:03,609
There's no words to explain it.

1563
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,439
I'm freezing them in time and ripping their bodies.

1564
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:15,199
That's fucking crazy though really.

1565
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:16,800
They look like dead space enemies.

1566
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:26,029
Like gum people.

1567
01:53:26,029 --> 01:53:27,229
Like jello people.

1568
01:53:28,189 --> 01:53:28,989
Taffy people.

1569
01:53:31,789 --> 01:53:34,189
I made this person in dreams two weeks ago.

1570
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:41,340
Whoa what I think I found the secret.

1571
01:53:42,989 --> 01:53:45,789
If you turn uh-oh I think I might have broke it.

1572
01:53:45,789 --> 01:53:46,989
I don't think it's gonna happen anymore.

1573
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:57,960
It really never it's never not funny.

1574
01:53:59,079 --> 01:53:59,560
Come on.

1575
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:07,520
Kill the other one.

1576
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:08,239
Kill the other one.

1577
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:14,380
Fuck.

1578
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,420
Why are you so good?

1579
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,199
Are you seriously this good?

1580
01:54:19,609 --> 01:54:21,289
Fuck you stop being such a good shot.

1581
01:54:23,079 --> 01:54:23,319
What?

1582
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:27,439
What the fuck?

1583
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:29,609
No way.

1584
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:33,050
No fucking way.

1585
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:35,390
Here he comes.

1586
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:35,710
Here he comes.

1587
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:36,029
Here he comes.

1588
01:54:36,029 --> 01:54:36,270
Come on.

1589
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:36,590
Come on.

1590
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:37,149
Moment of truth.

1591
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:51,930
You know typically I would be upset about this but you earned it man.

1592
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:53,600
You earned it.

1593
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:54,640
Look now he just wants a drink.

1594
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:57,739
You earned it dude.

1595
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:00,029
You earned your drink.

1596
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:05,439
Bottoms up.

1597
01:55:05,439 --> 01:55:09,470
I think there's more.

1598
01:55:17,899 --> 01:55:18,300
Sark.

1599
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:20,220
Oh yeah Sark came in.

1600
01:55:21,899 --> 01:55:24,380
A lot of closed casket funerals.

1601
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:36,079
God it's.

1602
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,000
I'm so happy that since that was like one of the first

1603
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,560
so that was one of the first real couple weeks of streaming on twitch

1604
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:52,079
and I'm like I still have that much fun like that's I still do that.

1605
01:55:52,079 --> 01:55:59,050
I still have that much fun in game still and that makes me happy that I can still have fun.

1606
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:08,350
Hopefully it's still fun for you too because I feel like I'm just I love

1607
01:56:10,359 --> 01:56:13,960
being able to um to like because I don't really watch these.

1608
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:14,359
I don't.

1609
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:22,220
I watched like maybe maybe like a year or two ago.

1610
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:24,380
I don't really watch old videos anymore.

1611
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:31,720
All right let's do another one.

1612
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:39,500
We spent seven hours watching you play a DOS text game for seven hours.

1613
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,060
What do you think?

1614
01:56:40,699 --> 01:56:41,960
Well that makes me happy.

1615
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:45,210
That's fucking I'm glad you still enjoy it.

1616
01:56:45,210 --> 01:56:46,840
All right let's do another one.

1617
01:56:52,939 --> 01:56:56,750
Let's do um it's always the monopoly guy.

1618
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:58,199
That's a good one.

1619
01:56:58,199 --> 01:56:59,079
That is that's a good one.

1620
01:56:59,079 --> 01:57:02,000
That's a really good one from what I remember.

1621
01:57:02,729 --> 01:57:06,890
Stars Mike I think was also fucked during that this video as well.

1622
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:08,430
If I remember correctly.

1623
01:57:08,989 --> 01:57:12,829
So let's get it on here.

1624
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:26,039
It's always the monopoly guy.

1625
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:32,270
This is this game out did this game ever really get completely bait?

1626
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:36,600
That was an easy p jupiter.

1627
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:46,640
Holy shit is this game should we play this again?

1628
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,000
Should is it worth playing again?

1629
01:57:50,539 --> 01:57:53,979
This just this is the flashback episode in the sitcoms.

1630
01:57:53,979 --> 01:58:05,180
Oh you know now I gotta make it bigger.

1631
01:58:05,739 --> 01:58:10,430
All right let's do it.

1632
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:26,699
Full screen HD 720p back when 720p was a big deal.

1633
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:29,579
Back when 720p meant 720p.

1634
01:58:29,579 --> 01:58:31,659
Holy shit you got a video in HD.

1635
01:58:31,659 --> 01:58:33,560
I remember.

1636
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,369
All right here we go.

1637
01:58:35,369 --> 01:58:37,899
Now that needs to be bigger.

1638
01:58:37,899 --> 01:58:44,539
Why is this not come on three two one let's go.

1639
01:58:44,539 --> 01:58:50,010
Oh you know you could be this guy with the book too.

1640
01:58:50,010 --> 01:58:51,850
This like monopoly man.

1641
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:53,210
You're the fucking monopoly man.

1642
01:58:57,819 --> 01:58:59,100
Nope it wasn't me.

1643
01:58:59,100 --> 01:58:59,600
What?

1644
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,140
And here comes the intro.

1645
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:10,460
I'm pretty good at I'm pretty good at these things I think.

1646
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:12,539
Well um you know I'm going to know what they are.

1647
01:59:12,539 --> 01:59:13,899
Yeah I know that's fine.

1648
01:59:15,069 --> 01:59:17,949
I love these N64 graphics I kind of miss them.

1649
01:59:17,949 --> 01:59:25,100
All right I'm ready.

1650
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:25,739
Are you?

1651
01:59:25,739 --> 01:59:29,010
Because you're gonna pick the monopoly guy now.

1652
01:59:29,010 --> 01:59:30,689
I'm gonna see the monopoly guy.

1653
01:59:30,689 --> 01:59:32,529
We why why would I be that stupid?

1654
01:59:32,529 --> 01:59:35,970
Oh yeah let me pick the guy that you would just what I yeah that's a that's a great idea.

1655
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:43,699
It's so scary it's so scary because I can see the the the laser.

1656
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:46,689
Is it on your head?

1657
01:59:47,569 --> 01:59:48,609
No I can just see it.

1658
01:59:48,609 --> 01:59:50,050
I can see the laser.

1659
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:53,250
I know well if you see the laser on your head of the monopoly.

1660
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,170
I can see the laser pointing into the room.

1661
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:56,930
That's all I'm telling you right now.

1662
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:03,869
Does he get me here?

1663
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:07,180
I'm just kidding.

1664
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:10,460
No don't shoot me.

1665
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:11,739
Don't don't shoot me.

1666
02:00:12,539 --> 02:00:16,000
Play in the psychology role.

1667
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,680
Oh yeah well I'm gonna get you.

1668
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:20,720
I think I've already got this figured out.

1669
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:22,399
You should be scared right now.

1670
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:23,520
You should be whimpering.

1671
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:24,979
Fuck!

1672
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:30,020
If that's the case these guys are all suspected double agents okay.

1673
02:00:30,979 --> 02:00:32,579
So that means you're over here somewhere.

1674
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:36,369
You're in this crowd somewhere.

1675
02:00:37,789 --> 02:00:39,789
Of course I'm in this whole room is a crowd.

1676
02:00:39,789 --> 02:00:42,430
No no no you're in this crowd like over on the right.

1677
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:44,109
Because these guys were suspected.

1678
02:00:44,829 --> 02:00:46,270
They were suspected criminals.

1679
02:00:47,069 --> 02:00:47,789
And you're over here.

1680
02:00:47,789 --> 02:00:49,149
You're one of these four people.

1681
02:00:49,949 --> 02:00:52,930
How could I possibly be one of these four people?

1682
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:54,050
You're always the guy in the mustard jacket.

1683
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:55,649
I think you're the guy in the mustard jacket.

1684
02:00:55,649 --> 02:00:56,149
Mm-hmm.

1685
02:00:57,649 --> 02:00:59,890
Why I think you're the guy in the mustard yellow jacket.

1686
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:00,850
Who wears mustard?

1687
02:01:01,489 --> 02:01:02,699
I got my eye on you.

1688
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:05,100
I got my eye on the mustard jacket.

1689
02:01:05,739 --> 02:01:08,960
Okay Nissy now you said I'm out of here.

1690
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:10,720
Which means you have to be one of these people.

1691
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:12,319
Because how would you have known he even walked away?

1692
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:15,659
Oh oh that's right I just figured you out.

1693
02:01:16,829 --> 02:01:17,869
Thinking about that one.

1694
02:01:17,869 --> 02:01:20,189
You're one of the guys in the mustard colored jacket.

1695
02:01:21,789 --> 02:01:25,250
Okay I don't know which one of them you are.

1696
02:01:25,250 --> 02:01:26,609
But I know or you're the lady.

1697
02:01:27,170 --> 02:01:28,529
All right gray everybody else out.

1698
02:01:28,529 --> 02:01:30,130
I know which one of these guys you are.

1699
02:01:30,689 --> 02:01:34,880
You're that guy.

1700
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,239
You're definitely that guy.

1701
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:38,930
Say your prayers.

1702
02:01:41,869 --> 02:01:42,369
No!

1703
02:01:42,369 --> 02:01:43,149
You're not good at this.

1704
02:01:43,149 --> 02:01:43,789
He was the lady.

1705
02:01:43,789 --> 02:01:44,829
You were the you were the lady.

1706
02:01:44,829 --> 02:01:46,989
You were the I totally knew you were one of those guys.

02:01:46,989 --> 02:01:47,550
Or you were the lady.

1708
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:48,050
Oh no.

1709
02:01:49,949 --> 02:01:50,449
I had it.

1710
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:52,590
Did I pick it again?

1711
02:01:52,590 --> 02:01:53,710
You're the fucking monopoly guy again.

1712
02:01:54,779 --> 02:01:56,539
I picked monopoly guy again.

1713
02:01:56,539 --> 02:01:59,579
You're just gonna play with the monopoly guy every single time.

1714
02:02:00,539 --> 02:02:02,430
This is a poker game.

1715
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:03,550
I'm not gonna give you any tails.

1716
02:02:03,789 --> 02:02:06,750
Ha ha ha yeah that's the major tail.

1717
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:08,029
Are there 16 different party goers?

1718
02:02:08,670 --> 02:02:09,149
I don't know.

1719
02:02:09,149 --> 02:02:10,109
It looks like there are.

1720
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:11,810
I'm taking the shot.

1721
02:02:14,579 --> 02:02:16,579
I was the monopoly guy.

1722
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:19,220
Busted jacket.

1723
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:20,020
You thought it was busted.

1724
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:26,189
I should have shot the monopoly guy.

1725
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:30,270
Yeah you really should have because it would have been like the monopoly guy.

1726
02:02:30,989 --> 02:02:32,670
Like it is every single time.

1727
02:02:34,079 --> 02:02:36,560
You seriously better not pick him again.

1728
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:37,760
It's not gonna work.

1729
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,279
That is why you titled it that.

1730
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:39,920
Yeah that's true.

1731
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:43,789
Hmm this is tricky.

1732
02:02:44,430 --> 02:02:45,630
I don't want to get it wrong.

1733
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:54,560
I have my suspicions.

1734
02:02:55,119 --> 02:02:56,159
Mustard jacket.

1735
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:58,479
I'm standing right next to mustard jacket.

1736
02:02:58,479 --> 02:02:59,520
That's a mistake.

1737
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,000
My suspicions are squabbling.

1738
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:06,479
You don't have very much time.

1739
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:07,439
I made it real easy.

1740
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:09,600
You haven't completed your missions.

1741
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,479
There's no way you have.

1742
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:19,979
Okay okay screw you monopoly guy.

1743
02:03:19,979 --> 02:03:21,659
I don't think it's you but screw you.

1744
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:24,380
Are you kidding me?

1745
02:03:25,819 --> 02:03:27,899
I was moving so obviously to yeah.

1746
02:03:27,899 --> 02:03:31,899
Like I wasn't doing the correct like NPC world of warcraft walk.

1747
02:03:32,859 --> 02:03:36,220
I wasn't doing like the world of warcraft wolf walk.

1748
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:37,180
Really?

1749
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:43,489
Yeah someone's already and oh that's not even that can't be you.

1750
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:46,420
Because that's the double agent as well.

1751
02:03:46,979 --> 02:03:50,539
You can think whatever you want bro.

1752
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:53,340
Wow he's a wow clicker.

1753
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:54,220
You want to know what I think?

1754
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:55,979
What do you think?

1755
02:03:55,979 --> 02:03:56,539
Let's see it.

1756
02:03:56,539 --> 02:03:58,699
I think I think there's a lot of statues here.

1757
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:01,180
There are a lot of statues here I guess.

1758
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:01,979
You know what Jerma?

1759
02:04:02,539 --> 02:04:02,779
What?

1760
02:04:04,029 --> 02:04:05,069
Safety is off.

1761
02:04:05,069 --> 02:04:06,189
What do you mean the safety is off?

1762
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:07,630
Safety is off.

1763
02:04:08,750 --> 02:04:10,750
He's just got it was so it's so nerve-racking.

1764
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:11,550
Shoot that guy.

1765
02:04:13,439 --> 02:04:15,119
Do it shoot that guy right now.

1766
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:18,399
He's the next best thing to the monopoly guy.

1767
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:19,920
Shoot him shoot him right now.

1768
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,039
Shoot that guy right now.

1769
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,119
No shoot him in the head.

1770
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,409
No I'm taking my time.

1771
02:04:28,529 --> 02:04:31,409
Blow that guy's fucking head clean off his shoulders.

1772
02:04:31,409 --> 02:04:32,770
Who's this lady?

1773
02:04:32,770 --> 02:04:34,930
No you pay attention to the other guy.

1774
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:38,210
That lady didn't do anything.

1775
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:39,569
That lady's going the other way.

1776
02:04:39,569 --> 02:04:41,569
See he's going this way.

1777
02:04:42,689 --> 02:04:44,529
I did like the voice like it's me.

1778
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:55,279
I'm just staring at you.

1779
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:56,239
Why don't you shoot me?

1780
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:01,779
Does he get this?

1781
02:05:01,779 --> 02:05:02,819
I don't remember.

1782
02:05:02,819 --> 02:05:03,619
Does he get it right?

1783
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:16,399
No what is about to happen.

1784
02:05:17,119 --> 02:05:18,079
He he does.

1785
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:21,359
Oh every everything is about to happen.

1786
02:05:22,979 --> 02:05:24,340
No monopoly guy this time.

1787
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,060
You ready?

1788
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:30,180
I'm ready.

1789
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:31,220
Okay.

1790
02:05:32,579 --> 02:05:33,699
You have to hit accept.

1791
02:05:33,699 --> 02:05:34,340
Hit accept.

1792
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:35,939
I was stretching.

1793
02:05:37,789 --> 02:05:38,750
The stretch.

1794
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:49,060
You gotta go for it sometimes.

1795
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:50,260
You gotta go for it.

1796
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:52,020
You didn't it wasn't the wrong idea.

1797
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:54,979
No I'm not having this guy show up to no more parties.

1798
02:05:54,979 --> 02:06:09,569
Are you sure it's not him?

1799
02:06:11,090 --> 02:06:11,890
I'm not.

1800
02:06:13,890 --> 02:06:17,649
Okay okay you're picking him this time though.

1801
02:06:17,649 --> 02:06:18,770
I know you can't resist.

1802
02:06:20,689 --> 02:06:22,609
Can we please play around?

1803
02:06:22,609 --> 02:06:23,109
Yes.

1804
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:27,810
Where you do not instantly kill the monopoly man.

1805
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:31,680
You could just watch my laser.

1806
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:35,199
That's fine.

1807
02:06:36,079 --> 02:06:37,279
That's perfectly fine.

1808
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,659
Fucking monopoly man every time.

1809
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:46,180
He's gonna take the shot.

1810
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:46,739
I know he is.

1811
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:51,760
What's he doing just standing over there.

1812
02:06:54,779 --> 02:06:55,979
He's just standing over there.

1813
02:06:55,979 --> 02:06:57,579
He's not doing anything.

1814
02:06:57,579 --> 02:06:58,539
Too suspicious.

1815
02:07:02,399 --> 02:07:05,680
All right I I'm not shooting the monopoly guy.

1816
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:09,420
I'm not going to shoot.

1817
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:10,460
Oh it is the fucking monopoly.

1818
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:11,659
You can tell it's 2012.

1819
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:15,859
No.

1820
02:07:17,359 --> 02:07:22,609
I tried to shoot.

1821
02:07:22,609 --> 02:07:23,109
Hold on.

1822
02:07:24,210 --> 02:07:27,380
Yeah I tried to shoot the monopoly guy.

1823
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:30,659
I'm not going to shoot the fucking monopoly guy instantly.

1824
02:07:33,699 --> 02:07:34,500
I would have had it.

1825
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:35,859
I would have had it.

1826
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:45,810
You took like a turn too quickly.

1827
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:49,729
You had one job was to kill the monopoly.

1828
02:07:54,989 --> 02:07:56,270
Oh did you like that video?

1829
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,199
That was a classic one.

1830
02:08:05,199 --> 02:08:10,539
That was a classic one.

1831
02:08:10,539 --> 02:08:14,960
Ah reminiscing of yesteryear.

1832
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:20,539
Watch my curls video.

1833
02:08:20,539 --> 02:08:35,460
No we already watched that like 50 times.

1834
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:36,979
Skyrim sliders.

1835
02:08:39,630 --> 02:08:41,310
Oh yeah that is a video isn't it?

1836
02:08:42,699 --> 02:08:44,300
Extreme body sliders.

1837
02:08:44,939 --> 02:08:47,100
I forgot yeah I'll put that one on.

1838
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:51,869
Let's put that one on.

1839
02:09:08,739 --> 02:09:10,260
Three no three to four.

1840
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:10,899
Four years ago.

1841
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:16,060
Just about four years ago this video was made.

1842
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:26,560
And then we'll yeah then we'll watch like a couple of videos.

1843
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:31,220
On um maybe like an old star video.

1844
02:09:36,689 --> 02:09:38,130
Death to Spies already did it.

1845
02:09:38,130 --> 02:09:38,369
Did it.

1846
02:09:38,369 --> 02:09:39,569
That was the first one we did.

1847
02:09:39,569 --> 02:09:48,369
Let's get it on.

1848
02:09:48,369 --> 02:09:51,649
So those of you that asked me to play Skyrim.

1849
02:09:52,289 --> 02:09:53,090
This is the video.

1850
02:09:53,090 --> 02:09:55,329
This is the reason why I cannot play it.

1851
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:56,210
I just can't.

1852
02:10:08,159 --> 02:10:08,720
Hold on.

1853
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:09,119
Hold on.

1854
02:10:09,119 --> 02:10:09,920
Don't start yet.

1855
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:29,439
Okay so this is the reason why I cannot play Skyrim.

1856
02:10:29,439 --> 02:10:32,590
Because I did this.

1857
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:33,229
And away we go.

1858
02:10:34,029 --> 02:10:46,399
My child the task is at hand.

1859
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:52,319
You must go under cover to stop the human dragon conflict.

1860
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:54,460
Father I'm not ready.

1861
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:55,500
Silence.

1862
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:56,939
You've always been ready.

1863
02:10:57,659 --> 02:10:59,420
You must live among them.

1864
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:01,979
Be part of the human race.

1865
02:11:01,979 --> 02:11:04,619
Find out what it's like to be human.

1866
02:11:04,619 --> 02:11:05,819
But what if I fail?

1867
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:08,460
Take the magical cloaking cloak.

1868
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:10,939
It will always disguise you as a human.

1869
02:11:10,939 --> 02:11:14,539
Our ancestors used dragon wizardry to create the spell.

1870
02:11:14,539 --> 02:11:16,619
It's extremely strong and powerful.

1871
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:17,819
As long as you wear this.

1872
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:21,199
Oof that was we went to zero.

1873
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:26,239
I paused it don't worry.

1874
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:35,600
All right let's go back to here.

1875
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:37,600
Take the magical cloaking cloak.

1876
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:40,079
It will always disguise you as a human.

1877
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:43,680
Our ancestors used dragon wizardry to create the spell.

1878
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:45,760
It's extremely strong and powerful.

1879
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:48,159
As long as you wear this you are safe.

1880
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:50,239
I love you my son.

1881
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:51,279
I love you too dad.

1882
02:11:51,279 --> 02:11:52,000
Be careful.

1883
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:59,359
First day go in meet a few people.

1884
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:02,560
Good day folks.

1885
02:12:03,119 --> 02:12:04,079
A dragon.

1886
02:12:04,079 --> 02:12:05,680
I saw a dragon.

1887
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:06,159
What?

1888
02:12:06,159 --> 02:12:06,960
Oh shit.

1889
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:08,880
Cloak doesn't work.

1890
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,199
Dad a magic cloak.

1891
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:13,439
Really it was probably just shit faced.

1892
02:12:14,079 --> 02:12:15,760
Please stop hitting me with the sword.

1893
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:18,960
Please we can live together in harmony.

1894
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:19,680
Don't you see.

1895
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:26,609
Maybe a tad on the large side for a head.

1896
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:28,720
Longer neck.

1897
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:31,100
We put his head forward a little bit.

1898
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:32,140
You know he's real perceptive.

1899
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:33,020
He sniffs around a lot.

1900
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:34,460
He really really wants to get to the bottom of stuff.

1901
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:35,420
He's a private investigator.

1902
02:12:35,979 --> 02:12:36,300
What?

1903
02:12:36,939 --> 02:12:40,859
And I think uh I think that's all right.

1904
02:12:40,859 --> 02:12:41,659
I like it.

1905
02:12:43,659 --> 02:12:44,460
A little bigger.

1906
02:12:44,460 --> 02:12:45,579
Yeah that's good.

1907
02:12:45,579 --> 02:12:46,140
That's good.

1908
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:47,979
We're not going to go any more extreme than this.

1909
02:12:53,569 --> 02:12:54,850
It's a dreams character.

1910
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:57,899
It's a dreams sculpture.

1911
02:12:57,899 --> 02:12:58,539
Excuse me.

1912
02:13:00,829 --> 02:13:01,789
I just was wondering.

1913
02:13:04,189 --> 02:13:07,699
I can't even see anything.

1914
02:13:07,699 --> 02:13:12,289
It looks like I seriously took this guy's face and molded it out of clay.

1915
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:13,569
Good old clay.

1916
02:13:13,569 --> 02:13:15,090
This is an art project that I did.

1917
02:13:15,090 --> 02:13:19,250
I found out that I had to do this art project 15 minutes before it was due.

1918
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:20,609
And it was to make a person's face.

1919
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:23,060
I can do better than this.

1920
02:13:27,710 --> 02:13:28,750
Dero Pop that's right.

1921
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:40,430
It's like bullfrog person listening to this guy.

1922
02:13:41,470 --> 02:13:42,750
Sitting on a park bench.

1923
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:45,899
How can you keep a straight face right there?

1924
02:13:45,899 --> 02:13:47,500
How would you not be scared of this?

1925
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:50,140
The hamburger guy.

1926
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:56,939
He like looks over like what the fuck are you doing here?

1927
02:13:56,939 --> 02:13:57,739
You walk away.

1928
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:00,619
See how big my arms are dude?

1929
02:14:00,619 --> 02:14:04,460
Do you have any idea how big my arms are dude?

1930
02:14:06,449 --> 02:14:07,729
Sometimes you just gotta run.

1931
02:14:07,729 --> 02:14:08,289
You know what I mean?

1932
02:14:08,289 --> 02:14:11,489
Sometimes you're really going to build up that CO2 in your body and breathe it out.

1933
02:14:11,489 --> 02:14:13,250
You just kind of go on a little jog with your hands.

1934
02:14:13,250 --> 02:14:13,649
You know what I'm saying?

1935
02:14:15,409 --> 02:14:19,380
Get up right behind this guy and do our stealthy little secret technique.

1936
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:21,060
And give him a little small sword.

1937
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:21,779
Fucking sword.

1938
02:14:21,779 --> 02:14:22,979
Get right in the back with the backstab.

1939
02:14:25,939 --> 02:14:32,020
No I mean this is the little cubert right?

1940
02:14:32,819 --> 02:14:37,180
Who's trying to make cubert?

1941
02:14:41,659 --> 02:14:43,420
The fucking lady's dead man.

1942
02:14:44,539 --> 02:14:44,939
Wow.

1943
02:14:45,819 --> 02:14:47,300
What a sicko.

1944
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:49,779
I remember being sick for this video.

1945
02:14:58,180 --> 02:15:00,430
I have some bad news honey.

1946
02:15:00,430 --> 02:15:01,310
Yeah I had a cold this week.

1947
02:15:01,310 --> 02:15:04,029
I accidentally backed over the cat this morning.

1948
02:15:05,069 --> 02:15:07,310
It's okay he's still he's in high spirits.

1949
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:08,109
He's still all right.

1950
02:15:09,329 --> 02:15:11,170
You'll make a fine rug.

1951
02:15:13,170 --> 02:15:15,329
This little cat please leave me alone.

1952
02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:19,250
You old bitch.

1953
02:15:24,670 --> 02:15:25,869
She goes crazy.

1954
02:15:25,869 --> 02:15:28,270
You know I actually thought I was gonna have way more to say about this.

1955
02:15:29,619 --> 02:15:31,140
This is a cat riding a horse.

1956
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:35,380
I'll see you next year when this is a Disney Pixar movie.

1957
02:15:37,060 --> 02:15:39,539
Back away you foul humans.

1958
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:42,420
We have every right to go through this tunnel.

1959
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:43,539
You can't stop us.

1960
02:15:45,010 --> 02:15:47,170
Well you never seen a cat riding a horse before?

1961
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:49,149
Get cultured.

1962
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:53,949
Oh shit the fucking Thanksgiving turkey's on the loose.

1963
02:15:54,909 --> 02:15:56,109
This is the best character.

1964
02:15:57,090 --> 02:15:58,210
Hide the women and children.

1965
02:16:00,619 --> 02:16:03,420
The Thanksgiving turkey is the best character I've ever made.

1966
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:05,020
I'm just gonna run my meat shop.

1967
02:16:05,579 --> 02:16:07,020
I'm doing well for myself.

1968
02:16:07,579 --> 02:16:11,420
I don't have to be concerned that there's an evil Gumby behind me.

1969
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:13,180
Could be much worse.

1970
02:16:13,420 --> 02:16:17,899
Just don't let them know that you're afraid and everything will be okay.

1971
02:16:18,939 --> 02:16:25,500
So the Thanksgiving turkey is just the gum ball.

1972
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:27,579
The gum from the fire pro wrestling.

1973
02:16:27,579 --> 02:16:28,779
This is the Dark Souls game.

1974
02:16:29,979 --> 02:16:33,250
What Dark Souls boss did I make?

1975
02:16:34,049 --> 02:16:35,010
Yeah shoot to the arrow.

1976
02:16:35,010 --> 02:16:36,700
Go shoot me right in the penis.

1977
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:37,340
Good job.

1978
02:16:38,459 --> 02:16:43,379
Hey Jerma play Skyrim.

1979
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:45,649
Play Skyrim.

1980
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:48,299
I think you should like Skyrim.

1981
02:16:48,299 --> 02:16:56,129
At some point yeah I kind of can't.

1982
02:16:56,770 --> 02:16:57,889
It'd be such a good stream.

1983
02:16:57,889 --> 02:17:05,280
Yeah that's the thing about like video versus stream video versus stream.

1984
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:09,760
So that that was like five days worth of just recording stuff and making stuff

1985
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:13,040
and coming up with things to put on the camera and record it and edit it.

1986
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:19,280
It's like we do that still but it's like in real time over seven to ten hours.

1987
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,969
So it's it's interesting to see how it plays out like that.

1988
02:17:25,229 --> 02:17:26,110
Who is uglier?

1989
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:32,659
Who is uglier?

1990
02:17:32,659 --> 02:17:33,299
Saints Row.

1991
02:17:35,149 --> 02:17:36,430
Kung Fu chroma key.

1992
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:43,020
Ask nicely for crits.

1993
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:50,930
I haven't seen that in a long time either.

1994
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:55,649
Come on don't crash on me now internet.

1995
02:17:55,649 --> 02:17:57,090
I haven't seen that in a long time.

1996
02:17:57,950 --> 02:18:02,299
In fact I don't think I've seen that video since it was uploaded.

1997
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:04,340
Maybe.

1998
02:18:05,329 --> 02:18:05,969
Let's watch it.

1999
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:19,940
All right let's get this off for a second.

2000
02:18:22,030 --> 02:18:22,510
He's gone.

2001
02:18:29,569 --> 02:18:31,090
Ask nicely for crits.

2002
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:37,520
This video is long.

2003
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:39,600
This is like a 12 minute video.

2004
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:55,870
What even is what's the what's the concept in this video?

2005
02:18:55,870 --> 02:19:00,290
Oh didn't he have to he had to scream right?

2006
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:03,920
If he didn't scream as loud as he could I wouldn't give it to him.

2007
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:19,579
Let's get it on.

2008
02:19:19,579 --> 02:19:20,540
Two ads in a row.

2009
02:19:20,540 --> 02:19:21,500
What the fuck YouTube?

2010
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:22,459
What is this bullshit?

2011
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:34,260
All right this is this is very much this is a trip down memory lane for sure.

2012
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:35,940
This is old Team Fortress 2 content.

2013
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:39,700
I don't know what is going to be in this video.

2014
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:42,100
All I know is it exists and we're going to watch it.

2015
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:44,959
It's been a while.

2016
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:45,600
Here we go.

2017
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:47,120
Ask nicely for crits.

2018
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:54,379
All right we're all right we're going to play hide and seek.

2019
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:56,059
That's how it starts.

2020
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:57,739
Let's play hide and seek.

2021
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:00,909
Hide and seek come on.

2022
02:20:00,909 --> 02:20:01,790
Let's play hide and seek.

2023
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:05,069
Two minutes ago the idea was let's play Team Fortress 2.

2024
02:20:05,069 --> 02:20:07,709
Yeah but don't you want to play hide and seek with me now?

2025
02:20:07,709 --> 02:20:07,870
No.

2026
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:11,549
Look don't do not turn around because I don't want you to know where I am.

2027
02:20:12,350 --> 02:20:12,989
Understand?

2028
02:20:12,989 --> 02:20:13,950
Yes hide and seek.

2029
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:17,229
The probably dumbest thing you could ever think of we're doing it.

2030
02:20:17,229 --> 02:20:20,670
This isn't like you know normally people would just go play prop hunt

2031
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:22,750
but prop hunt's too stupid for you.

2032
02:20:22,750 --> 02:20:25,149
You need you have to take it to the next level of stupid.

2033
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:26,989
Okay I'm ready.

2034
02:20:26,989 --> 02:20:27,309
Okay.

2035
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:31,979
Wait is this where that comes from?

2036
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:35,760
Does that come from this video?

2037
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:38,399
Jerma, Jerma how's it going buddy?

2038
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:39,120

Waiting for my buddy star to come on over.

2042
02:20:46,719 --> 02:20:49,120
So context I'll give you context of what just happened there.

2043
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:53,920
So there was always like that running joke where like three two one time to start the video.

2044
02:20:55,219 --> 02:20:58,340
Like here comes the start of the video three two one.

2045
02:20:58,340 --> 02:20:59,379

Oh I'm just playing around just hanging out here waiting for you to come over.

2050
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:07,139
It was it was the here comes the YouTube start of the video thing.

2051
02:21:07,139 --> 02:21:11,120
We did it all the time.

2052
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:12,239
We thought it was funny.

2053
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:14,959
Jerma okay I'm ready.

2054
02:21:14,959 --> 02:21:15,360

Jerma, Jerma how's it going buddy?

2058
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:25,040

What are you doing over here?

02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:26,479
Hey what's up?

I'm just hanging out you know defending the point.

02:21:28,639 --> 02:21:31,360
Waiting for my buddy star to come on over.

Hey looks like we got some crits you can you can uh come with me right now.

2065

We're gonna be using these crits against uh enemy gamers you know.

2066
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:40,079
You tell me when you want me to do it.

2067
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:40,559
You want me?

2068
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:45,680
When I want you to do it you're gonna know because I'm going to scream.

02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:46,719
No he does though.

2070
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:48,959
And I'm really going to turn this down.

2071
02:21:57,020 --> 02:21:58,540
All right sorry I didn't get a lot of people there.

2072
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:00,700
I thought there'd be more closer than that.

2073
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:01,899
What the hell was that?

2074
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:06,370
It was so loud.

2075
02:22:06,370 --> 02:22:09,329
See he turned I don't do that usually.

2076
02:22:09,329 --> 02:22:14,930
See here's the thing again he turned his timeline volume down to five percent.

2077
02:22:15,569 --> 02:22:16,690
I didn't get five percent.

2078
02:22:16,690 --> 02:22:18,209
I got a hundred percent.

2079
02:22:18,209 --> 02:22:23,090
So that's I did I did snort right there.

2080
02:22:23,090 --> 02:22:24,850
That was like a that was a pig.

2081
02:22:24,850 --> 02:22:26,450
That was like a little piggy.

2082
02:22:26,450 --> 02:22:29,010
He's like he's more closer than that.

2083
02:22:29,010 --> 02:22:30,290
What the hell was that?

2084
02:22:35,170 --> 02:22:37,569
That was uh actually a pig snort.

2085
02:22:37,569 --> 02:22:39,090
That's not a typical one that I do.

2086
02:22:39,090 --> 02:22:40,610
Snorted I don't do that usually.

2087
02:22:41,889 --> 02:22:42,850
You don't do that usually.

2088
02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:43,809
Thanks for clarifying.

2089
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:46,129
Hey guys guys German doesn't do that usually.

2090
02:22:47,409 --> 02:22:49,649
It's still relevant right now.

2091
02:22:49,649 --> 02:22:51,329
It's not it's not a common thing.

2092
02:22:51,329 --> 02:22:52,370
Yeah I don't do it usually.

2093
02:22:53,329 --> 02:22:53,729
Okay.

2094
02:22:53,729 --> 02:22:55,010
I just said it again.

2095
02:22:55,010 --> 02:22:56,770
Please tell me you're gonna scream again.

2096
02:22:57,489 --> 02:22:59,250
Well how else am I gonna get you to crits me?

2097
02:23:01,170 --> 02:23:02,770
You're gonna have to build it up first.

2098
02:23:02,770 --> 02:23:04,450
Hold on I'm too like busy laughing.

2099
02:23:05,090 --> 02:23:05,489
All right.

2100
02:23:06,290 --> 02:23:08,340
All right so when we build these crits up.

2101
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:10,100
We need to take we need to take it real careful.

2102
02:23:11,059 --> 02:23:13,219
And his hit sound is me doing something.

2103
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:15,219
Whoa whoa whoa easy easy easy.

2104
02:23:15,219 --> 02:23:15,940
Hide hide.

2105
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:17,219
Hide why are we hiding?

2106
02:23:17,219 --> 02:23:20,180
Because there was a guy there that looked like he was going to shoot me.

2107
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:21,299
I killed him.

2108
02:23:21,299 --> 02:23:22,100
Oh you didn't okay let's go.

2109
02:23:22,100 --> 02:23:23,700
With the power of Kratos.

2110
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:30,500
With the power of the golden rocket launcher.

2111
02:23:34,819 --> 02:23:36,340
What are you going on about?

2112
02:23:36,340 --> 02:23:37,620
Talking about your golden rocket launcher.

2113
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:38,739
How it's like a family heirloom.

2114
02:23:38,739 --> 02:23:40,420
I was doing a whole thing there and you just cut me off.

2115
02:23:40,420 --> 02:23:41,219
No no he cut me off.

2116
02:23:41,219 --> 02:23:42,420
Do you have the crits?

2117
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:43,299
Yeah I'm about.

2118
02:23:44,899 --> 02:23:49,309
Watch out for the sentry.

2119
02:23:49,309 --> 02:23:50,750
I can't I can't all right.

2120
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:55,389
You are turning into the judge from who framed Roger Rabbit at this point.

2121
02:23:56,430 --> 02:24:02,430
No the worst thing is I heard one of my neighbors coming out of their apartment.

2122
02:24:02,430 --> 02:24:06,110
And they without question a hundred percent certainty they heard me screaming.

2123
02:24:09,790 --> 02:24:12,030
There's not a single doubt in my mind that they heard that.

2124
02:24:12,030 --> 02:24:13,950
I just don't know what their thought process was.

2125
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:17,149
All right this is also this is also somebody that shit their pants.

2126
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:20,430
While I was playing Overwatch with them.

2127
02:24:21,489 --> 02:24:24,129
He shit his actually shit his pants.

2128
02:24:24,129 --> 02:24:25,819
And I think I was streaming.

2129
02:24:26,690 --> 02:24:28,209
I was either streaming or making a video.

2130
02:24:28,209 --> 02:24:28,850
I forget what it was.

2131
02:24:28,850 --> 02:24:31,780
I was streaming it right.

2132
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:42,940
He pooed his pants and sat in it for like a fucking a long time.

2133
02:24:50,959 --> 02:24:52,639
I still I can't fucking believe that.

2134
02:24:54,610 --> 02:24:55,889
There's videos about that.

2135
02:24:55,889 --> 02:24:57,889
Yeah this dude shit his pants.

2136
02:24:57,889 --> 02:25:00,770
And he didn't want to like fuck up my stream.

2137
02:25:01,969 --> 02:25:05,170
He didn't want to like run away from the stream right.

2138
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:09,950
So he or with the video or the round.

2139
02:25:09,950 --> 02:25:11,389
It was something like that.

2140
02:25:11,389 --> 02:25:17,540
Yeah we didn't even win the game and he was trying really hard to end it.

2141
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:20,659
So he could just run away after the round was over.

2142
02:25:20,659 --> 02:25:25,629
Oh what a truce friend.

2143
02:25:25,629 --> 02:25:28,110
Imagine just shit in your pants and you don't care.

2144
02:25:28,110 --> 02:25:29,709
You're gonna play the round out.

2145
02:25:29,709 --> 02:25:31,229
No that's not like good friend.

2146
02:25:31,229 --> 02:25:34,110

Dude they need to start like DX racer makes those chairs.

2150
02:25:50,799 --> 02:25:52,879
Maybe DX racers just start making diapers.

2151
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,979
Have like the logo on them.

2152
02:25:56,540 --> 02:26:03,940
Would you shit in a DX racer diaper.

2153
02:26:05,010 --> 02:26:08,020
It meant you'd be cool.

2154
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:10,989
No.

2155
02:26:10,989 --> 02:26:15,780
All right let's keep watching.

2156
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:18,420
You can like this guy either won the lottery.

2157

That was like that was a happy scream.

Can you teach me how to shoot people in the air.

2161
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:34,899
Dude I'm telling you people you guys think.

2162
02:26:34,899 --> 02:26:37,860
You guys think that I'm like I don't make it up.

2163
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:41,459
Like I would that's like I just was saying I have the same reaction.

2164
02:26:41,459 --> 02:26:46,770

I'm going back.

2169
02:26:52,129 --> 02:26:53,729
If I went back in the past I'd be fine.

2170
02:26:53,729 --> 02:26:54,690
There would be no paradox.

2171
02:26:54,690 --> 02:26:55,489
I'd be perfectly fine.

2172
02:26:55,489 --> 02:26:57,090
I could meet myself and we would have the same.

2173
02:26:57,090 --> 02:26:58,209
We'd say the same fucking thing.

2174
02:27:01,469 --> 02:27:03,149
You know like don't ever meet yourself.

2175
02:27:03,149 --> 02:27:04,190

Let's go to the store and just walk around.

2182
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:16,540
Wait but no then the government will find out.

2183
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:17,739
And then one of us will get captured.

2184
02:27:17,739 --> 02:27:19,260
Will we both get captured?

2185
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:22,379
Or would only one of us get captured?

2186
02:27:22,379 --> 02:27:26,909
They would take us both right?

2187
02:27:26,909 --> 02:27:30,350
No they wouldn't get me.

2188
02:27:30,350 --> 02:27:31,700
They'd get him.

2189
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:34,350
Twins exist.

2190
02:27:40,780 --> 02:27:45,229
If you were yeah that's right twins exist.

02:28:05,579 --> 02:28:07,100
Alright I'm getting attacked.

Attacked.

2205
02:28:37,649 --> 02:28:39,090
Sound from an old video.

2206
02:28:39,090 --> 02:28:40,209
I was like when did I do that?

2207
02:28:40,209 --> 02:28:40,530

I'm being very easy.

2213
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:50,899
Nice nice.

2214
02:28:50,899 --> 02:28:51,700
We can walk our way out.

2215
02:28:51,700 --> 02:28:52,899
No this sniper is gonna headshot me.

2216
02:28:52,899 --> 02:28:54,500
Alright no more oh no stop.

I think it was four.

2219
02:29:03,979 --> 02:29:06,459
Slam and frothy milkshake.

2220
02:29:06,459 --> 02:29:09,420
Is the scream thing really necessary anymore?

2221
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:10,860
I don't know how else would you have known?

2222
02:29:12,379 --> 02:29:16,059
No no no just get on the point just get on the point just get on the point there's a pyro on top.

That's for sure.

2229

Alright stay right there.

2232
02:29:33,020 --> 02:29:34,219
Alright we're gonna play hide and seek again.

2233
02:29:36,059 --> 02:29:36,860
Where did he go?

2234
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:37,659
Alright come find me.

2235
02:29:38,299 --> 02:29:40,219
Oh god he doesn't know where I am.

2236
02:29:41,569 --> 02:29:42,690
I'm gonna go play the game.

2237
02:29:43,889 --> 02:29:45,010
He doesn't know he doesn't know.

2238
02:29:45,010 --> 02:29:48,530
Forget about you because you're obviously an insane person.

2239
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:49,489
I made it up.

2240
02:29:49,489 --> 02:29:50,290
I made that up.

2241
02:29:50,290 --> 02:29:50,850
Where is he?

2242
02:29:51,889 --> 02:29:57,329
So can we change the crit sound from you screaming to like you making a different sound

2383
02:36:26,379 --> 02:36:30,139
And it's because I didn't scream and you were unsure if I wanted it that time.

Put the gun down.

2514
02:45:48,770 --> 02:45:51,010

2520
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:08,319
I got scared.

2521
02:46:08,319 --> 02:46:09,360
I thought you were trying to kill me.

2522
02:46:10,159 --> 02:46:10,959
I went back.

2523
02:46:10,959 --> 02:46:12,719
I sat down at the computer right now.

2524
02:46:12,719 --> 02:46:15,440
But I thought you were using like telekinetic powers to try to kill me.

2525
02:46:17,219 --> 02:46:20,340
Your executive is dead.

2526
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:22,020

2527
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:23,459
This person's not alive.

2528
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:25,870
They're just not alive.

2529
02:46:26,670 --> 02:46:28,270
I'm tapped into the link.

2530
02:46:28,270 --> 02:46:29,229
No you're dead.

2531
02:46:29,229 --> 02:46:30,270
Your guy's not even breathing.

2532
02:46:30,270 --> 02:46:31,709
You're just sitting there as a corpse.

2533
02:46:32,829 --> 02:46:34,030
Easy easy easy.

2534
02:46:34,030 --> 02:46:35,309
Whoa why are you in here?

2535
02:46:39,280 --> 02:46:41,280
Your guy's face is so fucked up.

2536
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,159
One of his eyes is open and one of them is closed.

2537
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:47,379
You are deep in thought right now.

2538
02:46:47,379 --> 02:46:48,420
That thing has taken over.

2539
02:46:48,420 --> 02:46:49,700
You've done that too many times.

2540
02:46:51,219 --> 02:46:51,780
You know what I mean?

2541
02:46:51,780 --> 02:46:53,700
Like you've done this so many times.

2542
02:46:53,700 --> 02:46:55,780
You like shouldn't be doing this anymore.

2543
02:46:56,340 --> 02:46:56,979
Where the hell did you go?

2544
02:46:56,979 --> 02:47:06,000
Oh dude that was rough.

2545
02:47:06,719 --> 02:47:07,280
Oh wait no.

2546
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:09,520
I have to do one more thing before I head out.

2547
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:11,520
I just got one more thing I need to do.

2548
02:47:14,219 --> 02:47:14,620
No!

2549
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:20,899
What is going on?

2550
02:47:20,899 --> 02:47:22,659
This game is fucking so much fun.

2551
02:47:22,659 --> 02:47:23,780
He's beef raving.

2552
02:47:23,780 --> 02:47:24,500
Organ playing.

2553
02:47:26,590 --> 02:47:27,469
Don't look over here.

2554
02:47:30,030 --> 02:47:34,350
Whatever you do for like the next minute do not look over here.

2555
02:47:35,229 --> 02:47:39,549
Did you just make a unit that is playing an organ of death?

2556
02:47:40,930 --> 02:47:41,250
Nah.

2557
02:47:44,079 --> 02:47:48,559
You can turn around in 10 seconds and like notice that there's a monster behind you.

2558
02:47:48,559 --> 02:47:49,440
Really?

2559
02:47:49,440 --> 02:47:49,680
Yeah.

2560
02:47:50,559 --> 02:47:53,659
So you're telling me in 10 seconds I can turn around?

2561
02:47:53,659 --> 02:47:54,940
You might have to.

2562
02:47:54,940 --> 02:47:56,139
I would turn now.

2563
02:47:56,139 --> 02:47:56,700
Turn now.

2564
02:48:02,079 --> 02:48:03,360
You can't stop me.

2565
02:48:04,159 --> 02:48:05,040
He thinks he's so big.

2566
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:06,639
He thinks he's so goddamn strong.

2567
02:48:06,639 --> 02:48:10,239
Do you think he's strong enough to take on the march of the C-3PO's?

2568
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:10,959
I doubt it.

2569
02:48:12,559 --> 02:48:13,280
Oh shit.

2570
02:48:14,239 --> 02:48:19,299

Nothing much.

2576
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:38,399

2577
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:40,399

2580
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:44,319
Okay I'm coming.

2581
02:48:50,020 --> 02:48:50,739
What is this wind?

2582
02:48:51,379 --> 02:48:54,819
What a waste of 500 billion dollars.

2583
02:48:55,540 --> 02:48:58,829
My grandfather told me this is the button.

2584
02:48:58,829 --> 02:48:59,870
My grandfather.

2585
02:48:59,870 --> 02:49:01,389
When you know you've been defeated.

2586
02:49:01,950 --> 02:49:03,489
The final stand.

2587
02:49:04,659 --> 02:49:05,219
Activate it.

2588
02:49:06,530 --> 02:49:07,090
Let him come.

2589
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:13,680
They killed themselves.

2590
02:49:16,829 --> 02:49:17,709
What is this guy?

2591
02:49:19,010 --> 02:49:22,850
Oh yeah you can breach the other person's base with units.

2592
02:49:22,850 --> 02:49:23,350
I didn't.

2593
02:49:25,010 --> 02:49:25,569
I won.

2594
02:49:26,530 --> 02:49:28,530
Well how did you get out there?

2595
02:49:29,250 --> 02:49:30,129
Help.

2596
02:49:30,129 --> 02:49:32,129
What do you I don't understand how you did this.

2597
02:49:32,129 --> 02:49:32,690
Let me in.

2598
02:49:33,569 --> 02:49:34,530
Oh I'm gonna let you in.

2599
02:49:34,530 --> 02:49:35,329
Just be careful.

2600
02:49:36,049 --> 02:49:38,260
How did you get stuck out there?

2601
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:42,430
He wanted to discuss something.

2602
02:49:44,219 --> 02:49:47,040
Yeah what did you want to discuss?

2603
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:50,319
We're a military compound not too far away.

2604
02:49:50,319 --> 02:49:52,399
You've been yeah you know.

2605
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:56,659
Didn't even want to come up with anything.

2606
02:49:57,299 --> 02:49:58,479
What did I do again?

2607
02:49:59,440 --> 02:50:02,270
You gave up halfway through.

2608
02:50:02,270 --> 02:50:04,110
You know what it doesn't matter.

2609
02:50:04,110 --> 02:50:05,549
We were playing for two hours.

2610
02:50:05,549 --> 02:50:06,750
Two fucking hours of this.

2611
02:50:06,750 --> 02:50:08,030
What the hell have we been doing?

2612
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:11,760
It's true.

2613
02:50:12,479 --> 02:50:15,200
It's true we didn't even play the game.

2614
02:50:20,610 --> 02:50:21,889
We had a tendency to do that though.

2615
02:50:22,690 --> 02:50:26,049
We would just not do anything for like three hours.

2616
02:50:26,049 --> 02:50:28,770
And then be like you know what that was kind of fun.

2617
02:50:28,770 --> 02:50:30,209
I think that would be a pretty good video.

2618
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:37,680
Damnation.

2619
02:50:39,280 --> 02:50:41,040
I think yeah Damnation is a good one to do too.

2620
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:46,940
So we'll do we'll do Damnation.

2621
02:50:48,379 --> 02:50:57,459
We'll do Damnation Dying Light.

2622
02:50:57,459 --> 02:50:59,780
And then we'll see where we are from there.

2623
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:03,680
Let's do Damnation.

2624
02:51:14,459 --> 02:51:15,579
Oh I remember this one.

2625
02:51:16,139 --> 02:51:17,739
This is the Pop Tarts thing.

2626
02:51:22,079 --> 02:51:23,200
I remember this one.

2627
02:51:25,229 --> 02:51:29,709
This is actually this is the video where Star laughed harder than anything he's ever done.

2628
02:51:30,350 --> 02:51:31,709
For my what I remember.

2629
02:51:31,709 --> 02:51:36,959
He almost threw up laughing at like the stupid motorcycle I think right.

2630
02:51:36,959 --> 02:51:40,139
I believe this is that video.

2631
02:51:42,739 --> 02:51:45,780
I've never heard him laugh as hard as he did here.

2632
02:51:46,739 --> 02:51:48,579
No I've never heard him go harder than this.

2633
02:51:49,219 --> 02:51:51,010
All right here we go.

2634
02:51:52,180 --> 02:51:55,229
Let's get it on the screen why don't we.

2635
02:52:04,420 --> 02:52:08,979
Okay three two one go for it.

2636
02:52:08,979 --> 02:52:18,899
Extreme content.

2637
02:52:20,239 --> 02:52:20,879
Yeah on.

2638
02:52:20,879 --> 02:52:22,239
What is extreme content?

2639
02:52:22,239 --> 02:52:22,799
What does that mean?

2640
02:52:24,299 --> 02:52:25,659
It's not blood or gore.

2641
02:52:25,659 --> 02:52:27,899
Usually they the blood or gore is a checkbox.

2642
02:52:27,899 --> 02:52:29,420
Watch first scene of this game.

2643
02:52:29,420 --> 02:52:30,700
There's just gonna be tits everywhere.

2644
02:52:34,850 --> 02:52:36,129
What's I asked you a question.

2645
02:52:37,090 --> 02:52:37,569
I don't know.

2646
02:52:37,569 --> 02:52:40,059
I know she told me.

2647
02:52:40,059 --> 02:52:40,540
Rourke.

2648
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:41,020
Joaquin.

2649
02:52:41,899 --> 02:52:42,540
Joaquin.

2650
02:52:43,579 --> 02:52:44,059
Rourke.

2651
02:52:45,659 --> 02:52:47,659
That's the that's this person's name Joaquin.

2652
02:52:48,459 --> 02:52:50,059
That's something that like.

2653
02:52:50,059 --> 02:52:50,860
I want to move this way.

2654
02:52:50,860 --> 02:52:52,059
I'm not able to separate.

2655
02:52:53,180 --> 02:52:54,459
Oh well I want to move this way.

2656
02:52:54,459 --> 02:52:55,659
It's more comfortable in this seat.

2657
02:52:57,260 --> 02:52:57,899
Yeah that's better.

2658
02:52:58,540 --> 02:53:00,159
It's more comfy this way.

2659
02:53:02,030 --> 02:53:05,709
Now I got like a good I can like sit over here and your chats over here too.

2660
02:53:09,950 --> 02:53:12,190
So I got chat and I got the video.

2661
02:53:21,500 --> 02:53:22,379
There you go.

2662
02:53:22,379 --> 02:53:24,829
All right here we go.

2663
02:53:24,829 --> 02:53:27,840
Nice rat tail whatever.

2664
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:31,139
That's the that's this person's name Joaquin.

2665
02:53:31,860 --> 02:53:34,819
That's something that like Chung Li would scream when she shoots a fireball.

2666
02:53:34,819 --> 02:53:35,780
I'm able to separate.

2667
02:53:35,780 --> 02:53:36,500
Joaquin.

2668
02:53:37,459 --> 02:53:38,180
Joaquin.

2669
02:53:38,180 --> 02:53:39,940
Many of this old boy's basic controls.

2670
02:53:42,129 --> 02:53:43,170
Holy shit.

2671
02:53:44,129 --> 02:53:47,620
This is so loud.

2672
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:48,899
Loud.

2673
02:53:48,899 --> 02:53:50,819
This is the loudest thing I've ever experienced.

2674
02:53:50,819 --> 02:53:51,860
Let you come alone.

2675
02:53:51,860 --> 02:53:52,979
Joaquin.

2676
02:53:52,979 --> 02:53:53,620
Joaquin.

2677
02:53:57,700 --> 02:54:01,979
I hear that in my dreams.

2678
02:54:01,979 --> 02:54:04,219
Does it seriously have to be this loud?

2679
02:54:09,489 --> 02:54:10,690
I told you he was gonna die.

2680
02:54:10,690 --> 02:54:11,329
Ten bucks.

2681
02:54:14,209 --> 02:54:16,290
Is he gonna get run over by a motorcycle too?

2682
02:54:16,290 --> 02:54:17,489
That's been the best.

2683
02:54:17,489 --> 02:54:17,889
What?

2684
02:54:17,889 --> 02:54:18,850
What an awful shot.

2685
02:54:19,409 --> 02:54:20,530
And you're not shooting him.

2686
02:54:20,530 --> 02:54:21,569
How was you missing that?

2687
02:54:21,569 --> 02:54:23,170
How did you miss those three shots?

2688
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:24,370
I could do that.

2689
02:54:24,370 --> 02:54:25,170
Shoot him.

2690
02:54:25,170 --> 02:54:25,649
Shoot him.

2691
02:54:26,209 --> 02:54:27,649
He's already gone.

2692
02:54:30,129 --> 02:54:30,530
Star.

2693
02:54:31,170 --> 02:54:31,870
Yes.

2694
02:54:31,870 --> 02:54:34,590
I didn't want to be the first one to say this but I truly think

2695
02:54:35,549 --> 02:54:39,309
I truly think this weird agency is poisoning the water supply.

2696
02:54:40,110 --> 02:54:40,829
Oh no.

2697
02:54:43,100 --> 02:54:44,139
Where is he?

2698
02:54:44,139 --> 02:54:45,579
Breakfast is almost served.

2699
02:54:46,139 --> 02:54:47,020
Honey.

2700
02:54:47,020 --> 02:54:48,780
I have your favorite Pop-Tarts.

2701
02:54:49,819 --> 02:54:50,379
Pop-Tarts.

2702
02:54:52,299 --> 02:54:54,620
This is the one window though.

2703
02:54:54,620 --> 02:54:55,819
No, you broke it.

2704
02:54:56,700 --> 02:54:58,540
Did you see me trying to come through it?

2705
02:54:59,899 --> 02:55:02,620
You fucking broke it and you messed up the joke.

2706
02:55:04,209 --> 02:55:05,090
Honey.

2707
02:55:05,090 --> 02:55:08,129
I've got your favorite breakfast snack here waiting for you.

2708
02:55:08,770 --> 02:55:10,290
It's Pop-Tart.

2709
02:55:10,290 --> 02:55:11,170
Pop-Tart.

2710
02:55:13,170 --> 02:55:14,690
His head hits the top.

2711
02:55:15,729 --> 02:55:16,209
Honey.

2712
02:55:17,010 --> 02:55:19,569
You know there's Pop-Tarts down here.

2713
02:55:19,569 --> 02:55:20,049
Huh?

2714
02:55:20,049 --> 02:55:20,530
What?

2715
02:55:20,530 --> 02:55:21,170
Pop-Tarts?

2716
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:25,760
You fucking idiot dick.

2717
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:26,399
Get in there.

2718
02:55:27,280 --> 02:55:31,200
You know I've got all these breakfast toaster strudel things here.

2719
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,479
They're they remind me.

2720
02:55:32,479 --> 02:55:33,600
Toaster strudel.

2721
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:34,559
Toaster strudel.

2722
02:55:34,559 --> 02:55:36,079
Toaster strudel.

2723
02:55:36,079 --> 02:55:37,360
Toaster strudel.

2724
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:40,399
I got it in.

2725
02:55:41,549 --> 02:55:42,829
Off of Moria.

2726
02:55:42,829 --> 02:55:44,270
I remember this shit.

2727
02:55:44,270 --> 02:55:44,989
Don't we drive it back?

2728
02:55:44,989 --> 02:55:46,350
All right, I got it in.

2729
02:55:46,350 --> 02:55:47,149
I got it in the house.

2730
02:55:51,469 --> 02:55:52,670
I don't know what to do.

2731
02:55:52,670 --> 02:55:53,389
I don't.

2732
02:55:53,389 --> 02:55:54,030
I'm stuck.

2733
02:55:56,030 --> 02:55:57,870
Well, get off.

2734
02:56:02,850 --> 02:56:04,690
Get off of it so we can do this joke.

2735
02:56:05,489 --> 02:56:06,690
I kind of can't do it.

2736
02:56:10,129 --> 02:56:10,909
I can't.

2737
02:56:10,909 --> 02:56:11,709
Didn't you?

2738
02:56:11,709 --> 02:56:12,510
Yeah, I did from this.

2739
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:16,350
Once we start to actually drive it on the road.

2740
02:56:16,350 --> 02:56:17,309
All right, I'm gonna get off.

2741
02:56:17,309 --> 02:56:18,270
I almost passed out.

2742
02:56:18,270 --> 02:56:21,500
You got this on the second floor?

2743
02:56:21,500 --> 02:56:23,899
Honey, I have your favorite breakfast food.

2744
02:56:23,899 --> 02:56:24,540
Pop-Tart.

2745
02:56:28,719 --> 02:56:31,120
Yeah, that was so cool.

2746
02:56:31,120 --> 02:56:32,879
This is lagging so bad.

2747
02:56:32,879 --> 02:56:33,360
This is it.

2748
02:56:38,579 --> 02:56:40,340
This game just got so much better.

2749
02:56:43,780 --> 02:56:45,299
You can't take that.

2750
02:56:45,299 --> 02:56:49,219
You cannot drive like that.

2751
02:56:49,860 --> 02:56:50,899
The walls.

2752
02:56:50,899 --> 02:56:52,020
Riding on the walls.

2753
02:56:52,020 --> 02:56:52,659
Look at that.

2754
02:56:55,299 --> 02:56:56,659
That's fucking sick.

2755
02:56:57,540 --> 02:56:58,100
Listen to him.

2756
02:57:07,790 --> 02:57:08,670
No, don't go.

2757
02:57:11,149 --> 02:57:11,629
I'm dead.

2758
02:57:17,870 --> 02:57:19,229
I thought I died.

2759
02:57:19,229 --> 02:57:19,950
I was dead.

2760
02:57:20,989 --> 02:57:24,270
I was like, I'm like gonna burga please throw up right now.

2761
02:57:27,229 --> 02:57:28,750
Why would you be able to do that?

2762
02:57:35,950 --> 02:57:37,389
Oh my god.

2763
02:57:37,389 --> 02:57:38,110
Listen to him.

2764
02:57:38,110 --> 02:57:40,030
Yeah, he's fucking going nuts.

2765
02:57:40,989 --> 02:57:43,069
What is extreme content?

2766
02:57:43,069 --> 02:57:43,870
What does that mean?

2767
02:57:44,510 --> 02:57:48,620
This was such a boring game.

2768
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:50,379
And then they added this to it.

2769
02:57:54,299 --> 02:57:55,420
Oh, you're in another room.

2770
02:57:56,620 --> 02:57:58,059
Watch out for this guy.

2771
02:57:58,059 --> 02:57:58,700
I'm gonna die.

2772
02:58:00,700 --> 02:58:02,299
No, what?

2773
02:58:03,100 --> 02:58:03,979
I think you ran me over.

2774
02:58:03,979 --> 02:58:04,459
I'm dead.

2775
02:58:07,600 --> 02:58:08,079
All right.

2776
02:58:08,079 --> 02:58:09,920
Here's your last chance, honey.

2777
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:11,440
They're nice and piping hot.

2778
02:58:11,440 --> 02:58:12,639
Pop-Tart.

2779
02:58:12,639 --> 02:58:14,159
Please give me the Pop-Tart.

2780
02:58:14,159 --> 02:58:14,879
Yes.

2781
02:58:14,879 --> 02:58:15,440
Oh, fuck.

2782
02:58:19,299 --> 02:58:19,860
We got it.

2783
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:27,659
Oh, he spawns in the room, right?

2784
02:58:28,379 --> 02:58:31,260
I'm gonna use my superpowers to see where he is.

2785
02:58:32,299 --> 02:58:35,489
I'm not climbing up.

2786
02:58:36,209 --> 02:58:40,510
This is like on all those movies you watch with like the

2787
02:58:40,510 --> 02:58:43,229
Oh, the school bus is just hanging by a thread.

2788
02:58:43,229 --> 02:58:44,110
How much it's going.

2789
02:58:44,829 --> 02:58:48,000
I'm stuck perfectly.

2790
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,280
Like I have no traction.

2791
02:58:49,280 --> 02:58:50,159
You cannot move at all?

2792
02:58:54,209 --> 02:58:54,850
No.

2793
02:58:54,850 --> 02:58:56,899
You cannot move this at all.

2794
02:58:56,899 --> 02:58:57,700
He just fly off?

2795
02:59:00,579 --> 02:59:01,620
Oh, yeah.

2796
02:59:01,620 --> 02:59:02,739
Sure, you can't.

2797
02:59:03,940 --> 02:59:04,579
No, no.

2798
02:59:04,579 --> 02:59:06,979
Hitting the jet booster on the back kind of help.

2799
02:59:07,780 --> 02:59:08,100
All right.

2800
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:08,579
I'm done.

2801
02:59:08,579 --> 02:59:09,780
I'm out of this fucking game.

2802
02:59:09,780 --> 02:59:19,219
Chalk it up for games that you kind of wish that you played more of.

2803
02:59:20,180 --> 02:59:25,329
You kind of wish that you played that way more than you actually did.

2804
02:59:29,219 --> 02:59:31,139
But someone was asking why are we doing this?

2805
02:59:31,139 --> 02:59:31,780
Why are we doing?

2806
02:59:31,780 --> 02:59:32,340
Wait, where are you?

2807
02:59:32,340 --> 02:59:32,739
You're over here.

2808
02:59:33,540 --> 02:59:34,739
What camera are we looking at right now?

2809
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:41,340
Because I have dropped just about 100,000 frames.

2810
02:59:42,450 --> 02:59:44,850
So I couldn't really do anything.

2811
02:59:44,850 --> 02:59:45,969
So we're just handing it out.

2812
02:59:45,969 --> 02:59:47,969
Figured we'd just watch some videos for a few hours.

2813
02:59:52,180 --> 02:59:53,139
It's bad.

2814
02:59:53,139 --> 02:59:53,620
It's bad.

2815
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:56,299
But let's watch Dying Light.

2816
03:00:00,850 --> 03:00:05,250
Yeah, I think I actually have to go from here.

2817
03:00:05,250 --> 03:00:07,280
This is fun.

2818
03:00:07,280 --> 03:00:08,639
Yeah, I'm glad we got it.

2819
03:00:08,639 --> 03:00:10,239
I'm glad I didn't just like turn it off.

2820
03:00:10,799 --> 03:00:14,819
I'm glad we got to at least stream for three, four plus hours here.

2821
03:00:15,379 --> 03:00:19,739
So let's watch the Dying Light video.

2822
03:00:19,739 --> 03:00:27,139
I mean, we salvaged the stream.

2823
03:00:27,139 --> 03:00:27,940
It was salvaged.

2824
03:00:27,940 --> 03:00:28,979
If we can at least hang out.

2825
03:00:33,440 --> 03:00:34,399
Dying Light.

2826
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:40,750
Is that, I think it's the star.

2827
03:00:40,750 --> 03:00:41,790
It's a star video, right?

2828
03:00:42,510 --> 03:00:43,709
No, we both made one of these.

2829
03:00:46,799 --> 03:00:47,520
It, oh, okay.

2830
03:00:47,520 --> 03:00:48,399
So I have one too.

2831
03:00:48,959 --> 03:00:51,600
This is Legend of the Tunnel Troll.

2832
03:01:04,319 --> 03:01:05,600
They're both good.

2833
03:01:05,600 --> 03:01:09,780
Let me get this on here.

2834
03:01:12,850 --> 03:01:14,930
Legend of the Tunnel Troll.

2835
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:20,799
That, oh, the, the tunnel.

2836
03:01:20,799 --> 03:01:22,319
Here, here's another one of those.

2837
03:01:22,319 --> 03:01:24,159
We tried to do something over and over again.

2838
03:01:24,159 --> 03:01:24,879
It just doesn't work.

2839
03:01:26,989 --> 03:01:28,270
We did that quite often.

2840
03:01:28,270 --> 03:01:29,709
We tried, many times.

2841
03:01:30,350 --> 03:01:35,780
And sometimes you guys are only seeing like 20% of the attempts.

2842
03:01:35,780 --> 03:01:51,200
Okay, let's get that out of the way.

2843
03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:53,889
And let's get that back on the screen.

2844
03:01:55,329 --> 03:01:56,610
I'll get back on screen too.

2845
03:01:56,610 --> 03:01:56,930
Why not?

2846
03:01:56,930 --> 03:01:57,729
Here we go.

2847
03:01:57,729 --> 03:01:59,170
One, two, three.

2848
03:02:00,530 --> 03:02:08,350
Okay, so that's what that does.

2849
03:02:09,149 --> 03:02:10,350
Its head came off.

2850
03:02:10,350 --> 03:02:12,799
Yeah, interesting.

2851
03:02:12,799 --> 03:02:13,680
Okay, interesting.

2852
03:02:15,379 --> 03:02:17,139
Sir, you appear to be on fire.

2853
03:02:21,360 --> 03:02:21,840
Just dead.

2854
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:24,079
What?

2855
03:02:24,799 --> 03:02:25,440
Why?

2856
03:02:25,440 --> 03:02:27,360
I thought I had more health than that.

2857
03:02:27,360 --> 03:02:28,719
You just instant died.

2858
03:02:31,860 --> 03:02:32,899
That fake laugh.

2859
03:02:32,899 --> 03:02:34,579
Funny, funny, funny, funny.

2860
03:02:42,780 --> 03:02:53,680
Skip, skip, skip.

2861
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:56,799
It's going in my video.

2862
03:02:58,799 --> 03:02:59,840
It's going in my video.

2863
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:00,319
Yes, it is.

2864
03:03:02,319 --> 03:03:03,840
What's your response to what you just did?

2865
03:03:05,760 --> 03:03:06,319
Very quickly.

2866
03:03:06,319 --> 03:03:08,239
Well, I want to hear like, what's your response.

2867
03:03:08,239 --> 03:03:09,120
I'm bored.

2868
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:15,649
Here's another funny tidbit for you.

2869
03:03:16,770 --> 03:03:19,329
We used to be recorded saying all kinds of fucking weird shit.

2870
03:03:19,889 --> 03:03:21,409
And it would always be that.

2871
03:03:21,409 --> 03:03:23,809
You would always be like, no, no, no, dude, don't put that in your video.

2872
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:28,540
And it would be fun sometimes to put it in anyways.

2873
03:03:31,219 --> 03:03:32,819
Like, don't, dude, don't put that in.

2874
03:03:32,819 --> 03:03:34,500
That's not something you should put in the video.

2875
03:03:35,219 --> 03:03:36,500
No, dude, I'm gonna.

2876
03:03:36,500 --> 03:03:37,540
No, don't, don't, don't.

2877
03:03:37,540 --> 03:03:39,940
Dude, like, what about my reputation?

2878
03:03:39,940 --> 03:03:47,790
And sometimes you just put it in.

2879
03:03:47,790 --> 03:03:51,170
Sometimes you just put it in.

2880
03:03:51,170 --> 03:03:51,809
Got my gun.

2881
03:03:52,370 --> 03:03:55,069
Oh, what do you guys got?

2882
03:03:55,069 --> 03:03:56,270
What's going on over here, boys?

2883
03:03:58,190 --> 03:03:58,829
Put your hands up.

2884
03:04:00,110 --> 03:04:01,309
Put your fucking hands up.

2885
03:04:01,309 --> 03:04:02,030
Hands in the air.

2886
03:04:03,569 --> 03:04:03,969
Yeah.

2887
03:04:03,969 --> 03:04:04,450
Oh, yeah.

2888
03:04:04,450 --> 03:04:14,540
Doesn't need to fucking ruin that guy.

2889
03:04:20,909 --> 03:04:21,790
I destroyed it.

2890
03:04:21,790 --> 03:04:22,590
That was like.

2891
03:04:22,590 --> 03:04:23,069
Psycho.

2892
03:04:23,790 --> 03:04:25,069
I wasn't the psycho.

2893
03:04:25,069 --> 03:04:25,709
I didn't do it.

2894
03:04:25,709 --> 03:04:28,110
The guy threw a fucking axe in his head.

2895
03:04:29,569 --> 03:04:31,010
And he looks left and right.

2896
03:04:31,010 --> 03:04:32,450
Like, what the fuck do I do now?

2897
03:04:33,489 --> 03:04:34,770
Yeah, he was like, still.

2898
03:04:34,770 --> 03:04:35,329
All right.

2899
03:04:35,329 --> 03:04:37,170
This game was so fucked.

2900
03:04:37,170 --> 03:04:39,250
It was just so all over the place.

2901
03:04:39,250 --> 03:04:40,129
Like two seconds.

2902
03:04:40,129 --> 03:04:42,049
He was just like, oh, shit.

2903
03:04:42,049 --> 03:04:42,370
Okay.

2904
03:04:42,370 --> 03:04:43,170
There's an action.

2905
03:04:43,250 --> 03:04:44,450
My fucking head.

2906
03:04:44,450 --> 03:04:45,170
What am I doing?

2907
03:04:45,170 --> 03:04:46,370
Do I run away?

2908
03:04:46,370 --> 03:04:48,129
Got real dark, real quick.

2909
03:04:48,129 --> 03:04:49,729
Oh, no, no, no.

2910
03:04:49,729 --> 03:04:50,370
No.

2911
03:04:50,370 --> 03:04:50,610
Somewhere.

2912
03:04:50,610 --> 03:04:51,649
Can I eat these trees?

2913
03:04:51,649 --> 03:04:52,209
No.

2914
03:04:52,209 --> 03:04:52,690
I don't know.

2915
03:04:52,690 --> 03:04:54,850
I really just don't know anything about where I am right now.

2916
03:04:55,409 --> 03:04:57,090
Who goes there?

2917
03:04:57,090 --> 03:04:59,649
This is the tunnel and I am its troll.

2918
03:04:59,649 --> 03:05:00,370
What do you want?

2919
03:05:01,010 --> 03:05:03,729
I just was looking for some food, looking for some supplies.

2920
03:05:03,729 --> 03:05:04,850
I just wanted to find something.

2921
03:05:04,850 --> 03:05:07,090
When I come in, I have food and supplies.

2922
03:05:07,090 --> 03:05:07,969
I have both of those.

2923
03:05:07,969 --> 03:05:08,930
I have a lot of them.

2924
03:05:08,930 --> 03:05:09,889
Is this some kind of trick?

2925
03:05:10,690 --> 03:05:11,969
No, I'm not a troll.

2926
03:05:12,850 --> 03:05:13,489
All right.

2927
03:05:13,489 --> 03:05:14,290
I believe you.

2928
03:05:14,290 --> 03:05:14,930
Come in.

2929
03:05:14,930 --> 03:05:15,729
Come in.

2930
03:05:15,729 --> 03:05:16,610
What do you got back here?

2931
03:05:16,610 --> 03:05:17,010
Do you have any?

2932
03:05:17,010 --> 03:05:17,569
I got this.

2933
03:05:18,690 --> 03:05:19,170
What happened?

2934
03:05:20,530 --> 03:05:22,530
Just you wait 30 or 40 seconds.

2935
03:05:22,530 --> 03:05:24,129
Something real bad is coming.

2936
03:05:24,129 --> 03:05:25,010
Didn't work.

2937
03:05:25,010 --> 03:05:25,729
You got to do it again.

2938
03:05:26,450 --> 03:05:27,889
Can I eat these trees?

2939
03:05:27,889 --> 03:05:29,889
Maybe I can chew on the bark and get some syrup.

2940
03:05:29,889 --> 03:05:30,610
I really don't know.

2941
03:05:30,610 --> 03:05:31,329
I'm just...

2942
03:05:31,329 --> 03:05:32,290
What is that?

2943
03:05:32,290 --> 03:05:33,729
Who goes there?

2944
03:05:33,729 --> 03:05:36,049
Who tries to enter the tunnel of the troll?

2945
03:05:36,049 --> 03:05:36,370
Not me.

2946
03:05:36,370 --> 03:05:38,850
I was just looking for some supplies and maybe some food to eat.

2947
03:05:39,649 --> 03:05:42,450
Well, hey, I have supplies and food all back here.

2948
03:05:42,450 --> 03:05:43,409
If you just want to come in the tunnel for a second.

2949
03:05:43,409 --> 03:05:44,129
Some kind of trick?

2950
03:05:45,569 --> 03:05:46,610
No, I'm not a troll.

2951
03:05:46,610 --> 03:05:47,250
Oh, okay.

2952
03:05:47,250 --> 03:05:47,969
I believe you.

2953
03:05:47,969 --> 03:05:48,610
Just come in.

2954
03:05:48,610 --> 03:05:49,329
It'll be everything.

2955
03:05:49,329 --> 03:05:50,049
I really hope you have...

2956
03:05:51,170 --> 03:05:52,370
I hope you have pizza rolls.

2957
03:05:53,250 --> 03:05:53,569
What's this?

2958
03:05:53,569 --> 03:05:54,290
What have you done to me?

2959
03:05:54,770 --> 03:05:55,329
What have you done?

2960
03:05:55,969 --> 03:05:58,850
I just wait like 30 to 40 seconds microwave.

2961
03:05:58,850 --> 03:05:59,409
What are you talking about?

2962
03:05:59,409 --> 03:06:01,170
What am I waiting 30 or 40 seconds?

2963
03:06:01,969 --> 03:06:07,100
This joke is so bad.

2964
03:06:07,100 --> 03:06:07,819
It is.

2965
03:06:07,819 --> 03:06:08,620
It really is.

2966
03:06:08,620 --> 03:06:09,899
This is not like this.

2967
03:06:09,899 --> 03:06:14,219
This is worse than the fucking jump through the glass Pop-Tart joke.

2968
03:06:14,219 --> 03:06:15,180
Oh, call back.

2969
03:06:15,180 --> 03:06:16,139
That was a call back.

2970
03:06:26,299 --> 03:06:33,739
Why can't we not get the fuck off this stupid troll joke?

2971
03:06:35,979 --> 03:06:37,100
I'm dropping out.

2972
03:06:37,100 --> 03:06:38,299
We have to stop this now.

2973
03:06:41,489 --> 03:06:42,610
Hey, it's me.

2974
03:06:44,530 --> 03:06:46,530
Stock scream.

2975
03:06:46,530 --> 03:06:48,610
That did sound like a stock scream.

2976
03:06:49,329 --> 03:06:51,250
That was a stock scream.

2977
03:06:51,250 --> 03:06:51,969
Fucking hate troll.

2978
03:06:58,139 --> 03:06:59,420
I'll get this troll secret.

2979
03:06:59,420 --> 03:07:00,299
They're my secret.

2980
03:07:00,299 --> 03:07:01,020
Get away from me.

2981
03:07:01,020 --> 03:07:01,579
Get away from me.

2982
03:07:01,579 --> 03:07:02,379
I'm sick of it.

2983
03:07:02,379 --> 03:07:03,020
I have to troll.

2984
03:07:03,020 --> 03:07:05,180
I have to fucking hate troll.

2985
03:07:09,489 --> 03:07:10,370
I can't, man.

2986
03:07:11,329 --> 03:07:13,250
Oh my fucking god.

2987
03:07:13,250 --> 03:07:14,049
Stupid troll joke.

2988
03:07:16,290 --> 03:07:17,409
I'm dropping out.

2989
03:07:17,489 --> 03:07:18,690
We have to stop this now.

2990
03:07:21,870 --> 03:07:23,069
Hey, it's me.

2991
03:07:23,069 --> 03:07:24,270
Made it onto one of the towers.

2992
03:07:25,629 --> 03:07:28,610
You know we're both jumping off, right?

2993
03:07:31,569 --> 03:07:32,610
Edit that part out.

2994
03:07:32,610 --> 03:07:33,969
There's a fucking zombie up here.

2995
03:07:36,100 --> 03:07:36,819
Hold on.

2996
03:07:36,819 --> 03:07:38,340
Don't do anything to him.

2997
03:07:38,340 --> 03:07:39,940
How would you have ever made it up here?

2998
03:07:39,940 --> 03:07:41,219
She doesn't even have a arm.

2999
03:07:41,940 --> 03:07:43,629
This zombie is armed.

3000
03:07:43,629 --> 03:07:45,069
One armed climbed up here.

3001
03:07:45,069 --> 03:07:46,270
Are you telling me that's what happened?

3002
03:07:47,549 --> 03:07:48,510
No way.

3003
03:07:49,309 --> 03:07:58,620
What if she got up and just fly back up?

3004
03:07:58,620 --> 03:07:59,659
That's where this came from.

3005
03:07:59,659 --> 03:08:00,700
That is where this came from.

3006
03:08:01,500 --> 03:08:01,979
Hurry.

3007
03:08:01,979 --> 03:08:02,299
Quickly.

3008
03:08:02,299 --> 03:08:02,780
Quickly.

3009
03:08:02,780 --> 03:08:03,260
Hurry.

3010
03:08:03,260 --> 03:08:03,760
Whoa.

3011
03:08:04,940 --> 03:08:10,379
It's a spitter.

3012
03:08:11,819 --> 03:08:13,020
That cut scene just healed me.

3013
03:08:13,579 --> 03:08:15,899
I'm shouting because this fucked up infected motherfucker

3014
03:08:15,899 --> 03:08:19,100
with guts hanging out of his mouth just spit a bunch of toxic snot at me.

3015
03:08:20,700 --> 03:08:21,500
Motherfucker.

3016
03:08:22,540 --> 03:08:25,500
Toxic motherfucker was fucking snot in his mouth.

3017
03:08:25,500 --> 03:08:26,219
Turn your light off.

3018
03:08:26,379 --> 03:08:26,879
Uh.

3019
03:08:29,280 --> 03:08:31,040
Oh look there's like a door here.

3020
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:32,639
Oh whoa I thought it was real.

3021
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:38,719
All right I want you to go through my time travel machine

3022
03:08:38,719 --> 03:08:44,319
as you see here my lovely assistant head on through and I'll see you in a year 1900.

3023
03:08:48,459 --> 03:08:49,979
That's not as funny as I thought it was gonna be.

3024
03:08:56,190 --> 03:08:57,229
What the fuck?

3025
03:08:58,110 --> 03:08:59,790
Hey it's okay.

3026
03:08:59,790 --> 03:09:01,149
Are you all right sir?

3027
03:09:01,149 --> 03:09:03,870
Hey you just dropped like 10,000 feet.

3028
03:09:04,750 --> 03:09:05,469
Forgot that happened.

3029
03:09:05,469 --> 03:09:06,510
Hey what were we doing earlier?

3030
03:09:06,510 --> 03:09:08,829
Let's say go let's go go let's do parkour and jump.

3031
03:09:11,420 --> 03:09:12,459
Oh what are you doing?

3032
03:09:18,659 --> 03:09:21,920
This is such a fun multiplayer game it really was.

3033
03:09:21,920 --> 03:09:22,959
I'm pushing the boat.

3034
03:09:22,959 --> 03:09:24,239
No what is he doing?

3035
03:09:28,159 --> 03:09:29,680
You don't know what it looks like for you guys.

3036
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:34,479
I just want to ride the boat.

3037
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:36,000
I just want to go.

3038
03:09:36,959 --> 03:09:43,120
That's like somebody just learned unity and this is what they're they didn't animate anything.

3039
03:09:44,159 --> 03:09:46,559
They just learned how to like rig somebody in unity.

3040
03:09:46,559 --> 03:09:46,959
I got it.

3041
03:09:46,959 --> 03:09:47,440
He got it.

3042
03:09:49,379 --> 03:09:49,940
Got it.

3043
03:09:49,940 --> 03:09:50,340
Got it.

3044
03:09:51,709 --> 03:09:52,110
I got it.

3045
03:09:52,110 --> 03:09:52,590
He got it.

3046
03:09:53,149 --> 03:09:53,790
All right my turn.

3047
03:09:55,549 --> 03:09:56,989
How did you even attempt to do that?

3048
03:09:56,989 --> 03:09:58,190
I have no idea how you even tried.

3049
03:09:58,190 --> 03:10:01,549
There's a place you can stand where it's like completely it's really really easy to do.

3050
03:10:01,549 --> 03:10:05,309
All right what if I like start to if I start to fall and can I grab it maybe?

3051
03:10:05,309 --> 03:10:06,590
Oh I remember this.

3052
03:10:06,590 --> 03:10:08,510
No I wouldn't do it that way.

3053
03:10:08,510 --> 03:10:09,069
Going for it.

3054
03:10:10,030 --> 03:10:11,549
Look what I just did.

3055
03:10:11,549 --> 03:10:14,350
You want to talk about like falling and grabbing onto something?

3056
03:10:15,469 --> 03:10:17,149
Wow Jermis is the master of falling and grabbing onto things.

3057
03:10:17,149 --> 03:10:18,030
I'm fucking the man.

3058
03:10:22,559 --> 03:10:23,760
Back to square one.

3059
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:24,959
Everyone I want all the actors.

3060
03:10:26,639 --> 03:10:28,639
No shit no dude.

3061
03:10:28,639 --> 03:10:31,200
Hey just wait just wait like 30 seconds.

3062
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:32,879
Yeah guess what I'm they're gonna.

3063
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:34,719
Come on.

3064
03:10:34,719 --> 03:10:36,639
No get the fuck out of here.

3065
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:47,540
Oh god damn it.

3066
03:11:03,100 --> 03:11:04,540
We have to watch the other one.

3067
03:11:05,579 --> 03:11:07,020
We're gonna watch the other one.

3068
03:11:07,020 --> 03:11:08,540
We're gonna watch Star's video.

3069
03:11:09,739 --> 03:11:10,940
Here's the thing that this is the thing.

3070
03:11:12,780 --> 03:11:14,700
Star and I when we played the same game.

3071
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:17,659
Some more little youtuber lore for you.

3072
03:11:18,299 --> 03:11:20,959
We never made the same video.

3073
03:11:20,959 --> 03:11:24,799
We always made it a point to make completely different videos.

3074
03:11:24,879 --> 03:11:26,399
Because we didn't want it to just be.

3075
03:11:26,399 --> 03:11:28,799
Oh here's the same video from another perspective.

3076
03:11:28,799 --> 03:11:31,600
We wanted to always have completely different videos.

3077
03:11:32,940 --> 03:11:39,540
And it would sometimes would cause lighthearted arguments.

3078
03:11:39,540 --> 03:11:43,600
Because we would get into these little.

3079
03:11:43,600 --> 03:11:44,959
Oh that was really good.

3080
03:11:44,959 --> 03:11:46,239
That was a really fun clip.

3081
03:11:46,239 --> 03:11:47,680
Who's getting that one?

3082
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:50,110
I'd be like oh well you got like.

3083
03:11:51,309 --> 03:11:54,190
You got the guy like the car flipping and crushing the guy's head.

3084
03:11:54,190 --> 03:11:55,229
Yeah but I like the.

3085
03:11:55,229 --> 03:11:56,590
I think I should have that one.

3086
03:11:56,670 --> 03:11:57,309
I should have that clip.

3087
03:11:57,309 --> 03:11:59,299
That should be my clip.

3088
03:11:59,299 --> 03:12:02,350
That's where like need a clip or need a clip.

3089
03:12:02,350 --> 03:12:04,909
We would talk about what.

3090
03:12:04,909 --> 03:12:09,819
Who was going to have what and what in their video.

3091
03:12:09,819 --> 03:12:12,780
And sometimes I remember specifically watching a video of his.

3092
03:12:12,780 --> 03:12:14,700
And there was like a clip that I thought was really good.

3093
03:12:14,700 --> 03:12:17,819
And I was like damn I really wanted that one.

3094
03:12:18,540 --> 03:12:19,819
And he did the same thing though.

3095
03:12:19,819 --> 03:12:20,860
He did the same thing.

3096
03:12:20,860 --> 03:12:22,540
He'd watch videos of mine and be like.

3097
03:12:22,540 --> 03:12:25,100
Oh that was like that's better from my perspective.

3098
03:12:25,100 --> 03:12:25,819
It should have been mine.

3099
03:12:26,899 --> 03:12:29,579
So but it turned out pretty good.

3100
03:12:29,579 --> 03:12:34,020
Because you never watched a video twice.

3101
03:12:34,020 --> 03:12:35,219
From just a different camera angle.

3102
03:12:35,219 --> 03:12:36,260
It was always a different video.

3103
03:12:37,409 --> 03:12:39,090
So let's case in point.

3104
03:12:39,090 --> 03:12:40,530
Let's watch it right now and you'll see.

3105
03:12:45,040 --> 03:12:48,159
I think we would share like maybe like sometimes it'd be.

3106
03:12:48,159 --> 03:12:50,399
If there was something really really funny from another perspective.

3107
03:12:52,799 --> 03:12:54,159
Typically it would be different though.

3108
03:12:54,159 --> 03:13:01,840
Very different.

3109
03:13:01,840 --> 03:13:04,079
His video is titled Zombie Jackass.

3110
03:13:06,579 --> 03:13:10,000
Tubers that care.

3111
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:11,600
Well I honestly I just.

3112
03:13:12,670 --> 03:13:15,379
I just didn't want and neither did he.

3113
03:13:16,750 --> 03:13:19,069
It and this is obviously I don't want to.

3114
03:13:19,629 --> 03:13:24,590
You know throw unnecessary shade at.

3115
03:13:24,590 --> 03:13:40,299
Hold on it's talking to me in my ear.

3116
03:13:40,299 --> 03:13:42,299
It froze on me again.

3117
03:13:45,020 --> 03:13:46,540
But what I was saying is it.

3118
03:13:46,540 --> 03:13:49,860
Typically what you'd have you know.

3119
03:13:49,860 --> 03:13:52,899
Let's say let's say two or three people are recording together right.

3120
03:13:53,780 --> 03:13:56,579
And then they all upload the same exact footage.

3121
03:13:56,579 --> 03:13:58,260
It's just from a different angle.

3122
03:13:58,260 --> 03:14:00,340
And sometimes it wouldn't even be from a different angle.

3123
03:14:00,340 --> 03:14:03,780
Sometimes it'd be a game that was not a separate angle.

3124
03:14:03,780 --> 03:14:08,860
It was just here's the video three more times.

3125
03:14:08,860 --> 03:14:12,059
We just came to a conclusion together.

3126
03:14:12,059 --> 03:14:14,540
That it was we didn't really want to do that.

3127
03:14:14,540 --> 03:14:18,799
We didn't want to have that kind of scenario play out.

3128
03:14:18,799 --> 03:14:21,440
Because then if you've seen stars video.

3129
03:14:21,440 --> 03:14:23,280
Then you've already seen my video.

3130
03:14:23,280 --> 03:14:26,180
You've already seen you've already seen it.

3131
03:14:26,180 --> 03:14:32,459
What could we add to that to make it so it was different for you.

3132
03:14:32,459 --> 03:14:37,309
And but also to you know backtrack.

3133
03:14:37,309 --> 03:14:40,110
Some people were uploading like three or four times a day.

3134
03:14:40,110 --> 03:14:41,500
We didn't do that.

3135
03:14:41,500 --> 03:14:44,780
I uploaded like twice a week.

3136
03:14:44,780 --> 03:14:45,899
Maybe two or three times a week.

3137
03:14:50,319 --> 03:14:51,170
Here we go.

3138
03:14:51,170 --> 03:15:00,100
Three two one zero zero.

3139
03:15:03,219 --> 03:15:06,180
This is Steve and this is the fish tank.

3140
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:21,840
Run run.

3141
03:15:32,750 --> 03:15:33,309
Hey friend.

3142
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:40,399
I did put it down.

3143
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:44,430
He's gone.

3144
03:15:44,430 --> 03:15:45,469
This one.

3145
03:15:45,469 --> 03:15:46,110
There is this one.

3146
03:15:46,110 --> 03:15:47,229
It's a zombie.

3147
03:15:47,229 --> 03:15:49,229
You have to go on this bowl on the outside.

3148
03:15:52,319 --> 03:15:53,760
You fucking god damn it.

3149
03:15:54,639 --> 03:15:55,200
What did you.

3150
03:15:56,479 --> 03:15:57,680
I'm gonna make it.

3151
03:15:59,790 --> 03:16:00,430
I didn't make it.

3152
03:16:02,100 --> 03:16:03,379
You can't sleep now.

3153
03:16:03,379 --> 03:16:04,579
Yeah I can't sleep.

3154
03:16:04,579 --> 03:16:05,620
Yeah we just have to make our way to.

3155
03:16:05,620 --> 03:16:06,420
Where are you?

3156
03:16:06,420 --> 03:16:07,379
I'm down at the bottom.

3157
03:16:07,940 --> 03:16:10,979
Okay I'm coming.

3158
03:16:10,979 --> 03:16:13,700
What what I just zipped on what.

3159
03:16:14,979 --> 03:16:15,620
How do I do that?

3160
03:16:15,620 --> 03:16:16,899
I just wanted to jump to my death.

3161
03:16:17,379 --> 03:16:19,600
Oh I'm coming.

3162
03:16:20,159 --> 03:16:20,799
Oh wow.

3163
03:16:26,379 --> 03:16:26,700
Skip.

3164
03:16:27,899 --> 03:16:28,299
Skip.

3165
03:16:30,930 --> 03:16:31,969
They won't come in the door.

3166
03:16:33,979 --> 03:16:34,780
Oh yeah this.

3167
03:16:37,180 --> 03:16:37,819
Come on.

3168
03:16:37,819 --> 03:16:38,379
Come get us.

3169
03:16:39,180 --> 03:16:41,340
Don't shine the light on it.

3170
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:41,819
It hurts them.

3171
03:16:41,819 --> 03:16:42,860
Let them like run at us.

3172
03:16:50,020 --> 03:16:51,739
Oh it's almost daytime.

3173
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:55,360
They're just gonna like start dying.

3174
03:16:55,360 --> 03:16:56,959
Is this gonna be like Minecraft?

3175
03:16:56,959 --> 03:16:58,399
Are they gonna just sound like burning?

3176
03:16:59,280 --> 03:17:03,500
Come here you.

3177
03:17:04,379 --> 03:17:05,569
Knight survived.

3178
03:17:06,290 --> 03:17:07,729
Yeah he's just running now.

3179
03:17:07,729 --> 03:17:08,129
Chase them.

3180
03:17:08,129 --> 03:17:08,530
Chase them.

3181
03:17:08,530 --> 03:17:09,329
Oh yeah follow this guy.

3182
03:17:09,329 --> 03:17:10,209
Follow him.

3183
03:17:10,209 --> 03:17:11,809
Do not let this guy get away.

3184
03:17:11,809 --> 03:17:13,969
We need to find like the hideout for where these guys are.

3185
03:17:16,110 --> 03:17:16,909
Get out of the way.

3186
03:17:16,909 --> 03:17:18,110
You don't want to fucking shoot her.

3187
03:17:20,190 --> 03:17:22,110
Oh my god I'm gonna get a burn.

3188
03:17:23,229 --> 03:17:23,549
Damn it.

3189
03:17:23,549 --> 03:17:24,590
Oh which way do I go here?

3190
03:17:24,590 --> 03:17:26,750
I just my mom's gonna be so pissed at me.

3191
03:17:26,750 --> 03:17:27,870
How is he not dead yet?

3192
03:17:27,870 --> 03:17:28,750
Like what are you scared of?

3193
03:17:28,750 --> 03:17:29,229
I don't know.

3194
03:17:30,350 --> 03:17:31,790
Oh he jumped up here.

3195
03:17:31,790 --> 03:17:32,430
Go go go.

3196
03:17:32,430 --> 03:17:34,270
Oh no he can't get away.

3197
03:17:34,270 --> 03:17:35,229
Coffee.

3198
03:17:35,229 --> 03:17:36,030
Cheetos.

3199
03:17:36,030 --> 03:17:36,510
Chicken.

3200
03:17:43,010 --> 03:17:44,690
Hey can we help you?

3201
03:17:44,690 --> 03:17:46,290
Can we find your house or something?

3202
03:17:46,290 --> 03:17:47,489
Do you need help?

3203
03:17:47,489 --> 03:17:49,489
Uh yeah I could use a little bit of help.

3204
03:17:50,690 --> 03:17:51,329
He's on the run.

3205
03:18:12,559 --> 03:18:14,000
Hold on I need to see that again.

3206
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:15,120
Do you need help?

3207
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:17,120
Uh yeah I could use a little bit of help.

3208
03:18:18,079 --> 03:18:18,979
He's on the run.

3209
03:18:27,379 --> 03:18:28,500
He just hit his face.

3210
03:18:35,100 --> 03:18:37,659
It looks like he tried to slide under the fence.

3211
03:18:37,659 --> 03:18:39,420
He hit his head and died.

3212
03:18:42,030 --> 03:18:47,500
No we like cut him up now.

3213
03:18:50,190 --> 03:18:51,229
Who's Kratos?

3214
03:18:51,229 --> 03:18:52,510
Is that is that my name?

3215
03:18:54,030 --> 03:18:55,950
Did you just call someone on the phone?

3216
03:18:57,870 --> 03:19:01,500
Oh god I hear that and I don't even care.

3217
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:10,799
He edited this like making it look like he fell for like 10 seconds.

3218
03:19:12,370 --> 03:19:14,370
It was like 5,000 foot drop.

3219
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:28,959
I don't even know what we were trying to do.

3220
03:19:31,379 --> 03:19:32,180
Good joke.

3221
03:19:32,180 --> 03:19:33,139
Great joke.

3222
03:19:33,139 --> 03:19:34,579
That was a real good real good joke.

3223
03:19:35,299 --> 03:19:37,459
Your favorite pop tart cereal.

3224
03:19:37,459 --> 03:19:56,239
They're like come on let's go.

3225
03:19:56,959 --> 03:19:58,719
You think you can take me on?

3226
03:19:58,719 --> 03:19:59,920
You're just a bully.

3227
03:20:00,559 --> 03:20:01,120
Stay in there.

3228
03:20:02,639 --> 03:20:04,639
Another propane tank.

3229
03:20:04,639 --> 03:20:05,520
Stay here?

3230
03:20:05,520 --> 03:20:05,760
Yeah.

3231
03:20:06,719 --> 03:20:07,899
Why am I staying in here?

3232
03:20:13,940 --> 03:20:15,700
Hold on stay in there for a second.

3233
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:18,739
We also would trade footage to each other if somebody had something funny.

3234
03:20:19,459 --> 03:20:21,069
Stay in there for a second.

3235
03:20:24,620 --> 03:20:26,139
Jerma I was never in there.

3236
03:20:27,659 --> 03:20:29,579
Yeah I know it's embarrassing.

3237
03:20:29,579 --> 03:20:30,139
It's embarrassing.

3238
03:20:31,420 --> 03:20:32,219
It's embarrassing.

3239
03:20:35,899 --> 03:20:38,219
Hold on stay in there for a second.

3240
03:20:39,180 --> 03:20:43,620
Stay in there for a second.

3241
03:20:43,620 --> 03:20:48,750
All right Jerma I was never in there.

3242
03:20:51,229 --> 03:20:53,229
I was standing right next to you the whole time.

3243
03:20:58,030 --> 03:20:59,180
I'm dead.

3244
03:21:05,659 --> 03:21:08,530
Okay this thing seems to be going well.

3245
03:21:09,170 --> 03:21:12,780
She's not gonna hear us coming.

3246
03:21:12,780 --> 03:21:15,180
Here comes my super stealth patented ninja kick.

3247
03:21:18,719 --> 03:21:19,040
Lagged.

3248
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:21,870
Yes I'm a badass.

3249
03:21:21,870 --> 03:21:23,469
That actually happens in the game too.

3250
03:21:23,469 --> 03:21:24,590
Essentially that character only.

3251
03:21:31,229 --> 03:21:33,950
Why why why did I do that?

3252
03:21:33,950 --> 03:21:35,309
I sat here and I did that.

3253
03:21:36,110 --> 03:21:37,549
Okay that's what you have to understand.

3254
03:21:38,430 --> 03:21:39,870
Foliage is pretty fucking cool dude.

3255
03:21:39,870 --> 03:21:41,389
Look at all those.

3256
03:21:41,389 --> 03:21:50,209
Is that fucking hailing out right now?

3257
03:21:53,090 --> 03:21:54,370
Thank god.

3258
03:21:54,370 --> 03:21:54,690
Run.

3259
03:21:58,690 --> 03:21:59,729
There's like a bunch of birds.

3260
03:21:59,729 --> 03:22:00,770
First impression.

3261
03:22:00,770 --> 03:22:02,370
First impression of the birds.

3262
03:22:02,370 --> 03:22:03,170
They're pretty cool.

3263
03:22:03,170 --> 03:22:04,690
First impression of the zombies.

3264
03:22:04,690 --> 03:22:06,690
A little bit buttery on the hit there.

3265
03:22:06,690 --> 03:22:07,569
A little bit buttery.

3266
03:22:08,610 --> 03:22:09,969
And a little bit cream cheesy.

3267
03:22:09,969 --> 03:22:11,409
You know first impression of the zombie?

3268
03:22:11,409 --> 03:22:11,969
Cream cheese.

3269
03:22:19,069 --> 03:22:21,389
Somebody's throwing rocks.

3270
03:22:21,389 --> 03:22:24,190
No it's just I think it's like a hail or something weird.

3271
03:22:31,870 --> 03:22:32,989
All right we'll do a couple more.

3272
03:22:33,790 --> 03:22:35,549
And then I do have to leave.

3273
03:22:36,940 --> 03:22:37,979
Not because of the internet.

3274
03:22:37,979 --> 03:22:39,500
I mean it's been a pain in the ass.

3275
03:22:39,500 --> 03:22:42,299
But because I have to get Kim.

3276
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:45,440
So we'll do the bits and everything.

3277
03:22:45,440 --> 03:22:45,760
We will.

3278
03:22:46,479 --> 03:22:49,120
But this stream was going to be a little shorter than usual.

3279
03:22:49,840 --> 03:22:52,620
Probably about like five-ish hours.

3280
03:22:52,620 --> 03:22:54,299
It could have been potentially longer.

3281
03:22:54,299 --> 03:22:57,780
But you know the internet problem.

3282
03:22:57,780 --> 03:22:58,420
You know.

3283
03:22:58,420 --> 03:23:00,020
So let's do a couple more.

3284
03:23:00,020 --> 03:23:00,979
What else are we going to do here?

3285
03:23:04,860 --> 03:23:06,620
I have to do the definition.

3286
03:23:06,620 --> 03:23:08,059
Add the definition of the German joke.

3287
03:23:08,059 --> 03:23:09,659
I mean we just watched the two of them.

3288
03:23:14,270 --> 03:23:16,510
I guess I'll put it on.

3289
03:23:16,510 --> 03:23:18,670
Just because we just watched them both.

3290
03:23:20,530 --> 03:23:22,209
It's an unlisted video right?

3291
03:23:25,010 --> 03:23:26,450
It's a hidden video.

3292
03:23:26,450 --> 03:23:37,170
Was it ever publiced?

3293
03:23:41,170 --> 03:23:42,930
Mods linking the good version.

3294
03:23:42,930 --> 03:23:44,129
What do you mean the good version?

3295
03:23:44,690 --> 03:23:51,139
There's been the good version.

3296
03:23:51,700 --> 03:23:53,139
Why is there a good version?

3297
03:24:00,930 --> 03:24:10,450
No I'm not going to watch me watching Star watch definition of a German joke.

3298
03:24:10,450 --> 03:24:15,010
No I'm going to watch me watching me in.

3299
03:24:15,010 --> 03:24:20,590
This is going to be ultra compression.

3300
03:24:26,239 --> 03:24:26,639
All right.

3301
03:24:26,639 --> 03:24:26,879
All right.

3302
03:24:26,879 --> 03:24:27,360
I'll watch it.

3303
03:24:27,360 --> 03:24:27,840
I'll watch it.

3304
03:24:27,840 --> 03:24:28,399
All right.

3305
03:24:28,399 --> 03:24:37,790
So you're going to get you're going to get dual commentary from the both of us.

3306
03:24:37,790 --> 03:25:00,370
I'm getting like a flash player error.

3307
03:25:00,370 --> 03:25:02,750
What the fuck is going on here?

3308
03:25:02,750 --> 03:25:15,760
I don't have flash anymore.

3309
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:16,799
But not a flash.

3310
03:25:16,799 --> 03:25:17,680
It was like a little thing.

3311
03:25:17,680 --> 03:25:19,120
A little puzzle piece.

3312
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:24,399
All right.

3313
03:25:25,120 --> 03:25:26,399
I should have it.

3314
03:25:27,040 --> 03:25:29,170
And here's the thing.

3315
03:25:29,170 --> 03:25:31,010
A lot of people have probably haven't seen this.

3316
03:25:31,010 --> 03:25:32,930
A lot of you probably have not seen this video.

3317
03:25:33,649 --> 03:25:35,889
So I guess we're going to have to give you some context.

3318
03:25:36,770 --> 03:25:38,770
Context is check it out.

3319
03:25:40,989 --> 03:25:41,469
All right.

3320
03:25:41,469 --> 03:25:43,549
I'm going to give my context and he can give his context.

3321
03:25:43,549 --> 03:25:47,649
Okay.

3322
03:25:47,649 --> 03:25:52,100
So when I play games and this is even like off stream or on stream.

3323
03:25:52,100 --> 03:25:52,579
Doesn't matter.

3324
03:25:53,500 --> 03:25:57,459
I just kind of say stuff.

3325
03:25:57,459 --> 03:25:59,139
Even when the camera's not even on.

3326
03:25:59,780 --> 03:26:00,340
I just talk.

3327
03:26:01,420 --> 03:26:02,379
I say anything.

3328
03:26:02,379 --> 03:26:04,299
I repeat something over and over again.

3329
03:26:04,299 --> 03:26:08,610
I'll just like a song.

3330
03:26:08,610 --> 03:26:09,489
I'll just say a song.

3331
03:26:09,489 --> 03:26:11,649
I'll say a line just over and over and over again.

3332
03:26:11,649 --> 03:26:14,850
Just because it's my brain just functioning and working overtime for no reason.

3333
03:26:15,649 --> 03:26:18,579
So it's just like a stream of consciousness.

3334
03:26:18,579 --> 03:26:18,819
Yeah.

3335
03:26:18,819 --> 03:26:21,219
Just it just flows out of my brain and I just do it.

3336
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:24,899
So when we record these videos like you've been told before.

3337
03:26:25,899 --> 03:26:27,809
We edit a lot of shit.

3338
03:26:27,809 --> 03:26:31,739
And you cut out like all the times when you're like.

3339
03:26:33,809 --> 03:26:35,969
I believe I can fly.

3340
03:26:35,969 --> 03:26:38,290
I believe I can touch the sky.

3341
03:26:38,290 --> 03:26:39,409
And you do it like a hundred times.

3342
03:26:39,409 --> 03:26:40,850
You're just like, ah, that's not I'm going to get rid of that.

3343
03:26:40,850 --> 03:26:42,610
Because why would anybody want to hear me do that a hundred times?

3344
03:26:43,250 --> 03:26:52,290
Right.

3345
03:26:52,290 --> 03:26:56,530
Many of you guys may not have seen the definition of a German joke.

3346
03:26:56,530 --> 03:26:58,850
I wanted to watch this earlier and I forgot about it.

3347
03:26:58,850 --> 03:26:59,809
Oh, Star Chat.

3348
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:04,620
This was one of the secret videos apart with the zombie jackass.

3349
03:27:04,620 --> 03:27:09,260
You can see zombie jackass 666 dude zombies amount of views.

3350
03:27:09,260 --> 03:27:10,940
The secret video 45,000 views.

3351
03:27:10,940 --> 03:27:12,299
I wish I had made this public.

3352
03:27:13,260 --> 03:27:16,459
This is one of my favorite videos I've ever made of me in German.

3353
03:27:18,399 --> 03:27:22,399
And it is so insanely bad.

3354
03:27:22,479 --> 03:27:23,920
It is so stupid.

3355
03:27:23,920 --> 03:27:27,280
But this is German in a one minute, 37 second nutshell.

3356
03:27:27,280 --> 03:27:29,040
This is like who he is as a person.

3357
03:27:36,350 --> 03:27:38,059
Got it.

3358
03:27:38,059 --> 03:27:38,940
What's in the crate?

3359
03:27:42,290 --> 03:27:44,319
Oh, dude, there's a fucking knife.

3360
03:27:44,319 --> 03:27:47,600
There's coffee, cheese, it's chicken.

3361
03:27:47,600 --> 03:27:48,000
Hold on.

3362
03:27:49,440 --> 03:27:50,159
This is what I'm saying.

3363
03:27:50,159 --> 03:27:52,079
Like we're compressing it like four times.

3364
03:27:52,079 --> 03:27:53,440
I got to turn this all the way up.

3365
03:27:54,159 --> 03:27:56,530
I'm not sure I can even turn this up.

3366
03:28:06,059 --> 03:28:06,620
That's loud.

3367
03:28:06,620 --> 03:28:08,379
But I don't think I can turn this up anymore.

3368
03:28:10,159 --> 03:28:10,719
All right, here we go.

3369
03:28:11,899 --> 03:28:12,379
I tried.

3370
03:28:13,020 --> 03:28:13,659
Stupid.

3371
03:28:13,659 --> 03:28:14,940
But this is German in a one minute, 37 second nutshell.

3372
03:28:14,940 --> 03:28:24,030
This is like who he is as a person.

3373
03:28:24,030 --> 03:28:25,760
Got it.

3374
03:28:25,760 --> 03:28:26,639
What's in the crate?

3375
03:28:27,200 --> 03:28:30,260
What am I gonna get?

3376
03:28:30,260 --> 03:28:31,940
Oh, dude, there's a fucking knife.

3377
03:28:31,940 --> 03:28:34,979
There's coffee, cheese, it's chicken.

3378
03:28:35,700 --> 03:28:38,659
Coffee, chicken, cheese, it's chicken.

3379
03:28:38,659 --> 03:28:40,899
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3380
03:28:40,899 --> 03:28:42,979
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3381
03:28:42,979 --> 03:28:44,420
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3382
03:28:44,420 --> 03:28:46,100
It is like triggering me to do it.

3383
03:28:46,100 --> 03:28:47,860
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3384
03:28:48,340 --> 03:28:50,180
We're gonna assume, we're gonna watch out.

3385
03:28:50,180 --> 03:28:52,420
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3386
03:28:52,420 --> 03:28:54,260
Stop talking about coffee, Cheetos, or chicken.

3387
03:28:54,819 --> 03:28:57,139
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3388
03:28:57,139 --> 03:29:00,340
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3389
03:29:00,340 --> 03:29:01,540
He's like enabling me.

3390
03:29:01,540 --> 03:29:03,139
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3391
03:29:04,260 --> 03:29:07,459
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3392
03:29:07,459 --> 03:29:08,739
I didn't even realize this.

3393
03:29:10,819 --> 03:29:12,020
Holy shit.

3394
03:29:12,020 --> 03:29:12,340
Wow.

3395
03:29:12,899 --> 03:29:13,860
I didn't even pick this up.

3396
03:29:13,860 --> 03:29:14,739
It's been years.

3397
03:29:15,379 --> 03:29:18,500
He is enabling me to do this shit.

3398
03:29:18,500 --> 03:29:20,739
He's like triggering me to like do it.

3399
03:29:20,739 --> 03:29:22,260
He's like keeping me enabled.

3400
03:29:23,229 --> 03:29:23,629
Listen.

3401
03:29:23,629 --> 03:29:26,510
Eat Cheetos, chicken.

3402
03:29:27,969 --> 03:29:29,569
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3403
03:29:30,290 --> 03:29:35,389
Oh, coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3404
03:29:35,389 --> 03:29:35,950
Chicken.

3405
03:29:35,950 --> 03:29:36,270
Yeah.

3406
03:29:37,149 --> 03:29:44,829
Oh, coffee.

3407
03:29:46,190 --> 03:29:47,340
Whoa.

3408
03:29:51,489 --> 03:29:52,690
Cheetos, chicken.

3409
03:29:52,690 --> 03:29:54,610
Coffee, Cheetos.

3410
03:29:54,690 --> 03:29:56,049
Perhaps I should take both.

3411
03:29:58,530 --> 03:30:00,290
Perhaps I should take both.

3412
03:30:00,290 --> 03:30:01,729
I guess I'll take both.

3413
03:30:01,729 --> 03:30:02,770
Might be getting some Cheeto.

3414
03:30:02,770 --> 03:30:04,129
Might be getting some coffee.

3415
03:30:04,129 --> 03:30:06,690
Chicken, Cheetos, coffee, coffee.

3416
03:30:09,809 --> 03:30:11,729
Fucking coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3417
03:30:11,729 --> 03:30:12,610
Oh, really?

3418
03:30:12,610 --> 03:30:13,649
Because guess what's in here.

3419
03:30:14,530 --> 03:30:17,969
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.

3420
03:30:17,969 --> 03:30:19,409
There actually was coffee in there.

3421
03:30:19,409 --> 03:30:19,909
I know.

3422
03:30:21,569 --> 03:30:22,069
Yes.

3423
03:30:25,250 --> 03:30:26,610
I fucking loved it.

3424
03:30:27,569 --> 03:30:29,489
I laugh every time I watch it.

3425
03:30:29,489 --> 03:30:30,530
It is so bad.

3426
03:30:31,170 --> 03:30:32,930
I'm sitting here like I didn't mute my mic.

3427
03:30:32,930 --> 03:30:36,450
I'm like trying not to laugh to like not go over the video.

3428
03:30:37,409 --> 03:30:38,770
I want you to public it right now.

3429
03:30:39,329 --> 03:30:40,370
Did he public it though?

3430
03:30:40,370 --> 03:30:41,409
I don't even know if that works.

3431
03:30:41,409 --> 03:30:45,170
This is from January 30th, 2015.

3432
03:30:46,209 --> 03:30:47,889
What's going to happen next?

3433
03:30:47,889 --> 03:30:49,489
That's a great description.

3434
03:30:49,489 --> 03:30:49,729
What?

3435
03:30:49,729 --> 03:30:49,969
Yeah.

3436
03:30:49,969 --> 03:30:51,329
What's the next part?

3437
03:30:51,329 --> 03:30:52,450
Is he going to keep doing it?

3438
03:30:52,450 --> 03:30:52,950
Again?

3439
03:30:54,420 --> 03:30:54,920
God.

3440
03:30:56,850 --> 03:30:57,350
Listen.

3441
03:31:00,959 --> 03:31:03,280
Don't tell Jerm I've ever said anything nice about him.

3442
03:31:04,780 --> 03:31:10,450
But he is so good at making absolutely nothing funny sometimes

3443
03:31:11,409 --> 03:31:14,850
that for a while it was actually discouraging me from making videos.

3444
03:31:17,629 --> 03:31:19,149
At least that style of video.

3445
03:31:19,149 --> 03:31:22,190
I like my basically series because I feel like that's where I'm good at.

3446
03:31:23,149 --> 03:31:25,790
He could just go ahead and fucking make coffee,

3447
03:31:25,790 --> 03:31:28,190
Cheetos, and chicken funny for no fucking reason.

3448
03:31:29,069 --> 03:31:32,079
Well, hey, hold on, Star.

3449
03:31:32,079 --> 03:31:33,680
Before you let me interrupt you there.

3450
03:31:37,020 --> 03:31:40,459
His videos are some of the funniest fucking things I've ever watched.

3451
03:31:44,420 --> 03:31:50,290
Some of those edited videos are like 11 out of 10.

3452
03:31:50,290 --> 03:31:58,030
So friendship isn't friendship.

3453
03:31:58,030 --> 03:31:58,829
Just wonderful.

3454
03:31:59,950 --> 03:32:03,389
No, I think that, you know, whatever, I'll say it.

3455
03:32:03,389 --> 03:32:08,110
I think that I think that Star had some of the best videos on YouTube.

3456
03:32:08,110 --> 03:32:10,579
You know, I still think he does.

3457
03:32:11,219 --> 03:32:16,239
And I uploaded two.

3458
03:32:16,239 --> 03:32:18,799
I thought I uploaded some all right ones over the years.

3459
03:32:18,799 --> 03:32:22,909
You know, isn't that right?

3460
03:32:23,549 --> 03:32:24,829
Isn't that right, Star?

3461
03:32:24,829 --> 03:32:26,190
I cut the shirt on to prove it.

3462
03:32:27,069 --> 03:32:35,889
No, but for real, I will forever cherish how much fun this all was.

3463
03:32:37,469 --> 03:32:42,350
I've been 90 fucking years old just watching Family Feud in a bed.

3464
03:32:42,989 --> 03:32:46,239
And like somebody will say the word like Cheetos and I'll be like,

3465
03:32:47,379 --> 03:32:48,899
I remember that one.

3466
03:32:49,860 --> 03:32:51,459
That was a much slayed.

3467
03:32:52,020 --> 03:32:55,489
It's true.

3468
03:32:55,489 --> 03:32:56,450
That's fucking amazing.

3469
03:32:57,950 --> 03:33:03,540
But yeah, that's me being fucking strange and I just say words.

3470
03:33:06,780 --> 03:33:10,459
We will do, oh, mood.

3471
03:33:11,260 --> 03:33:11,739
Mood.

3472
03:33:11,739 --> 03:33:12,700
Oh yeah, mood.

3473
03:33:22,579 --> 03:33:26,020
What's the, because we're reaching over here about,

3474
03:33:26,020 --> 03:33:28,260
we'll be at about five hours after the bits probably.

3475
03:33:31,649 --> 03:33:32,610
Public that video?

3476
03:33:32,610 --> 03:33:33,809
I, that's his video.

3477
03:33:33,809 --> 03:33:36,209
I don't have, I don't have control over his channel.

3478
03:33:42,719 --> 03:33:43,440
Intervention.

3479
03:33:49,309 --> 03:33:50,670
Bargain Bin Beach Party.

3480
03:33:51,940 --> 03:33:53,059
Bloody Trapland.

3481
03:33:56,049 --> 03:33:57,170
You mad, bro.

3482
03:33:57,170 --> 03:33:58,049
You, what's this?

3483
03:33:58,049 --> 03:33:59,729
Why are you doing the you mad, bro thing?

3484
03:34:06,579 --> 03:34:07,860
Oh, yeah, we did Intervention.

3485
03:34:07,860 --> 03:34:09,139
We did Tactical Intervention already.

3486
03:34:13,920 --> 03:34:14,879
Zombie Penis.

3487
03:34:22,239 --> 03:34:23,680
Yeah, Zombie Penis is a good one.

3488
03:34:25,440 --> 03:34:26,479
Battle of the Toys.

3489
03:34:26,479 --> 03:34:27,760
That's also a good one too.

3490
03:34:28,799 --> 03:34:30,159
The, Battle of the Bots.

3491
03:34:30,159 --> 03:34:32,399
Battle of the Brainless Bots.

3492
03:34:32,399 --> 03:34:33,360
That's another good one.

3493
03:34:41,040 --> 03:34:42,239
All right, all right.

3494
03:34:42,239 --> 03:34:43,040
Here's what we're gonna do.

3495
03:34:43,040 --> 03:34:44,879
We're gonna do, we'll do Battle of the Brainless Bots

3496
03:34:44,879 --> 03:34:49,600
and then I'm gonna have to get out of here.

3497
03:34:49,600 --> 03:34:54,000
And I'm not gonna be live for at least tomorrow.

3498
03:34:54,000 --> 03:34:56,000
I'm gonna try to come back on Tuesday.

3499
03:34:56,000 --> 03:34:59,459
But I desperately need to get this fixed.

3500
03:34:59,459 --> 03:35:01,860
I'm gonna do whatever it takes over the next 48 hours

3501
03:35:01,860 --> 03:35:02,979
to make sure it works.

3502
03:35:02,979 --> 03:35:08,290
Because 100,000 drop frames is just unacceptable.

3503
03:35:08,290 --> 03:35:10,530
It's just, it's, it's unacceptable.

3504
03:35:10,530 --> 03:35:10,850
It is.

3505
03:35:10,850 --> 03:35:18,430
All right, let's get this on screen.

3506
03:35:27,790 --> 03:35:28,829
Do whatever, anything.

3507
03:35:30,180 --> 03:35:31,700
Okay, this is Battle of the Brainless Bots.

3508
03:35:31,700 --> 03:35:33,219
This is a TF2 video.

3509
03:35:33,219 --> 03:35:35,219
I might as well do, go out on a TF2 video.

3510
03:35:35,219 --> 03:35:46,879
All right, here we go.

3511
03:35:52,590 --> 03:35:54,670
Battle of the Brainless Bots.

3512
03:35:55,229 --> 03:35:59,700
This is when I pretend to go back in time to hydro.

3513
03:35:59,700 --> 03:36:00,739
No, that's another video.

3514
03:36:01,299 --> 03:36:03,329
All right, here we go.

3515
03:36:04,719 --> 03:36:05,760
Battle of the Brainless Bots.

3516
03:36:06,780 --> 03:36:07,819
End on Jerma is mad.

3517
03:36:07,819 --> 03:36:09,579
We've, I think we've already watched Jerma is mad.

3518
03:36:09,579 --> 03:36:12,430
At least once on this stream before.

3519
03:36:12,430 --> 03:36:14,989
Whoops.

3520
03:36:14,989 --> 03:36:16,110
No, go in full screen.

3521
03:36:16,750 --> 03:36:18,530
Hey, what are you doing?

3522
03:36:25,489 --> 03:36:27,329
No, it crashed.

3523
03:36:27,329 --> 03:36:29,489
It crashed, it froze and crashed.

3524
03:36:29,489 --> 03:36:30,530
I guess that's a new word.

3525
03:36:39,649 --> 03:36:40,770
I mean, if you guys like this,

3526
03:36:40,770 --> 03:36:43,860
if you guys think this is cool, we can do this again.

3527
03:36:44,579 --> 03:36:47,219
The only reason why we started to do this in the first place

3528
03:36:47,219 --> 03:36:48,500
is just because of the internet.

3529
03:36:48,500 --> 03:36:49,700
That's the only reason why we did it.

3530
03:36:50,260 --> 03:36:52,750
But if people like this and people think it's fun to,

3531
03:36:53,790 --> 03:37:03,819
um, keep doing this.

3532
03:37:03,819 --> 03:37:06,610
I think my, like my actual browser keeps crashing.

3533
03:37:07,250 --> 03:37:09,969
Damn, yes, come on.

3534
03:37:12,059 --> 03:37:13,579
It brings in the bucks.

3535
03:37:14,299 --> 03:37:17,940
Nah, it's just fun to, I would only want to do this

3536
03:37:17,940 --> 03:37:22,180
if it was, um, like I hadn't seen them in a while.

3537
03:37:22,180 --> 03:37:24,180
I don't, I want to watch ones that I haven't seen

3538
03:37:24,180 --> 03:37:25,860
because it's almost like, I forget some of the shit

3539
03:37:25,860 --> 03:37:26,579
that's in these videos.

3540
03:37:27,629 --> 03:37:29,149
A lot of these things I forget, actually.

3541
03:37:29,950 --> 03:37:32,350
It's been so long and I've put together,

3542
03:37:32,350 --> 03:37:34,750
I've seen so many clips and I've seen

3543
03:37:35,870 --> 03:37:36,989
so many timelines, right?

3544
03:37:36,989 --> 03:37:38,110
That it's almost hard to remember.

3545
03:37:38,750 --> 03:37:42,030
All right, can I please fucking interact with this?

3546
03:37:45,020 --> 03:37:45,899
Finally, Jesus.

3547
03:37:46,700 --> 03:37:48,700
All right, took long enough.

3548
03:37:48,700 --> 03:37:50,079
All right, here we go.

3549
03:37:50,639 --> 03:37:51,760
Battle of the Brainless Bots.

3550
03:37:56,219 --> 03:37:57,500
Three, two, one.

3551
03:37:58,780 --> 03:38:04,159
Jeremy, I'm already just so exhausted

3552
03:38:04,159 --> 03:38:06,959
from even trying to put this together.

3553
03:38:07,200 --> 03:38:13,149
There hasn't been an ounce of enthusiasm

3554
03:38:13,149 --> 03:38:14,750
in my voice since we started talking about this,

3555
03:38:14,750 --> 03:38:15,469
but now we're ready.

3556
03:38:15,469 --> 03:38:18,110
I sent you the info, let's do this.

3557
03:38:18,110 --> 03:38:20,510
You like do not want to do this at all.

3558
03:38:22,190 --> 03:38:24,030
That's like makes it, I was like threw up.

3559
03:38:24,030 --> 03:38:25,069
Did you hear that?

3560
03:38:25,069 --> 03:38:25,870
A little bit, yeah.

3561
03:38:26,909 --> 03:38:29,309
So here's the, here's what the deal is, right?

3562
03:38:29,309 --> 03:38:31,229
So here's Star, he's the soldier right here.

3563
03:38:31,950 --> 03:38:33,469
He's on red team, I'm on blue team.

3564
03:38:33,469 --> 03:38:34,190
This is upward.

3565
03:38:34,750 --> 03:38:38,829
We are going to both have a team of easy mode bots.

3566
03:38:38,829 --> 03:38:41,309
That means our bots are at the lowest difficulty

3567
03:38:41,309 --> 03:38:42,989
they could possibly be at.

3568
03:38:42,989 --> 03:38:44,670
And why is there a tank?

3569
03:38:45,229 --> 03:38:46,590
This feels familiar.

3570
03:38:46,590 --> 03:38:50,059
So easy, easy mode.

3571
03:38:51,180 --> 03:38:53,420
No, no, don't break your own fucking server.

3572
03:38:55,979 --> 03:38:57,579
They kept training into him.

3573
03:38:58,780 --> 03:39:00,139
Can you give me one second

3574
03:39:00,139 --> 03:39:01,979
to like just explain what's happening?

3575
03:39:06,540 --> 03:39:08,059
Look at this mess.

3576
03:39:09,709 --> 03:39:12,350
I can't believe you made like a trail to yourself.

3577
03:39:13,780 --> 03:39:14,180
Okay.

3578
03:39:15,780 --> 03:39:17,860
Yeah, even in really didn't think

3579
03:39:17,860 --> 03:39:19,299
you were ever going to be able to do this.

3580
03:39:20,979 --> 03:39:25,459
You brought the truck punchline over into team fortress two

3581
03:39:25,459 --> 03:39:26,979
and your server is going to crash.

3582
03:39:28,260 --> 03:39:29,700
There's no way we're making out of this one.

3583
03:39:30,659 --> 03:39:32,260
This place is shutting down.

3584
03:39:33,979 --> 03:39:35,979
Shit's like flying by my screen.

3585
03:39:36,940 --> 03:39:39,420
Oh no, we invested our money poorly.

3586
03:39:39,979 --> 03:39:41,579
We didn't put it into a 401k.

3587
03:39:42,299 --> 03:39:43,420
It's disappearing.

3588
03:39:44,860 --> 03:39:46,379
All of our money is disappearing.

3589
03:39:47,020 --> 03:39:49,579
Quick, somebody make a German and Bitcoin joke.

3590
03:39:49,579 --> 03:39:50,059
Quick.

3591
03:39:50,059 --> 03:39:52,299
You wanted to invest in a lollipop company.

3592
03:39:52,299 --> 03:39:53,340
It's all gone.

3593
03:39:53,340 --> 03:39:53,579
All right.

3594
03:39:53,579 --> 03:39:53,979
Come on out.

3595
03:39:57,600 --> 03:39:58,879
They are not leaving.

3596
03:39:58,879 --> 03:40:00,799
Oh yeah, they were one person is.

3597
03:40:00,799 --> 03:40:02,159
It seems two of them has left.

3598
03:40:03,360 --> 03:40:05,760
All right, there we go.

3599
03:40:05,760 --> 03:40:06,799
They're making some progress.

3600
03:40:06,799 --> 03:40:07,200
Don't worry.

3601
03:40:07,200 --> 03:40:11,680
We have our sentry set up in a very optimal situation with a scout.

3602
03:40:12,559 --> 03:40:13,680
They're actually pretty smart.

3603
03:40:15,280 --> 03:40:16,399
I think my guys are pushing it.

3604
03:40:16,399 --> 03:40:16,719
We got it.

3605
03:40:16,719 --> 03:40:20,079
We got a heavy medic combination coming in through the front control point here.

3606
03:40:20,079 --> 03:40:20,879
Pyro coming out here.

3607
03:40:20,879 --> 03:40:22,879
It looks like you see your spine.

3608
03:40:23,520 --> 03:40:24,639
No, I'm watching them.

3609
03:40:27,200 --> 03:40:28,079
What are they doing?

3610
03:40:31,840 --> 03:40:33,040
What is he still doing?

3611
03:40:37,760 --> 03:40:39,280
Oh, okay.

3612
03:40:39,280 --> 03:40:41,280
I'm going to pay attention to something else.

3613
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:43,120
Why is they doing a melee fight?

3614
03:40:44,399 --> 03:40:46,239
Are you kidding me right now?

3615
03:40:48,079 --> 03:40:48,719
What the fuck?

3616
03:40:50,159 --> 03:40:52,719
Did you seriously make every single person a spy?

3617
03:40:52,719 --> 03:40:53,040
Yes.

3618
03:40:53,760 --> 03:40:54,719
Oh, my God.

3619
03:40:55,680 --> 03:40:56,559
What are they doing?

3620
03:40:57,920 --> 03:40:59,280
What is your team doing?

3621
03:40:59,280 --> 03:40:59,680
What are?

3622
03:41:01,040 --> 03:41:03,219
Why are they freaking out in the corner over here?

3623
03:41:03,860 --> 03:41:05,299
That's just what spies do.

3624
03:41:05,299 --> 03:41:07,059
This is what you should be aiming for.

3625
03:41:08,739 --> 03:41:09,940
Oh, make sure you're disguised.

3626
03:41:09,940 --> 03:41:11,299
Yeah, they keep jumping and jumping.

3627
03:41:11,299 --> 03:41:15,139
I just heard like 10 seconds.

3628
03:41:16,190 --> 03:41:19,469
I wonder why they're trying to jump through the boards.

3629
03:41:20,270 --> 03:41:21,389
That doesn't work like that.

3630
03:41:21,389 --> 03:41:22,909
You're not like made out of taffy.

3631
03:41:24,190 --> 03:41:24,829
Here we go.

3632
03:41:27,250 --> 03:41:27,809
Here they come.

3633
03:41:30,690 --> 03:41:33,090
They're just all disguised as the same person.

3634
03:41:34,579 --> 03:41:35,299
Don't even tell me.

3635
03:41:35,299 --> 03:41:37,620
Please don't tell me they're all going to keep coming out of this door.

3636
03:41:38,579 --> 03:41:39,780
Where else would they go?

3637
03:41:39,940 --> 03:41:40,420
I don't know.

3638
03:41:40,420 --> 03:41:41,700
There's only one option.

3639
03:41:41,700 --> 03:41:42,579
I am a spy.

3640
03:41:42,579 --> 03:41:43,540
I go out this door.

3641
03:41:44,180 --> 03:41:46,260
All you a spy is an enemy.

3642
03:41:46,260 --> 03:41:48,180
I think you like broke them.

3643
03:41:48,180 --> 03:41:48,579
Hold on.

3644
03:41:48,579 --> 03:41:49,540
Let me see where they are.

3645
03:41:49,540 --> 03:41:50,020
I forget where they are.

3646
03:41:50,020 --> 03:41:50,899
Are they done?

3647
03:41:50,899 --> 03:41:52,739
No, they're all going out the front door now.

3648
03:41:52,739 --> 03:41:54,260
They're all going out the front door.

3649
03:41:55,299 --> 03:41:56,659
That spy is an enemy.

3650
03:41:59,170 --> 03:42:01,569
Okay, this is stupid.

3651
03:42:02,819 --> 03:42:03,700
Nobody's even attacking.

3652
03:42:03,700 --> 03:42:05,139
You don't want to tell me what stupid is.

3653
03:42:05,139 --> 03:42:06,500
No, they're going after each other.

3654
03:42:11,649 --> 03:42:11,809
No.

3655
03:42:12,770 --> 03:42:13,889
Did you get backstabbed?

3656
03:42:13,889 --> 03:42:15,250
I got backstabbed.

3657
03:42:15,250 --> 03:42:16,690
There was one too many of them.

3658
03:42:17,489 --> 03:42:18,610
No one's even going to go for the point.

3659
03:42:19,250 --> 03:42:21,889
This is going to last exactly three minutes and 32 seconds

3660
03:42:22,930 --> 03:42:26,049
because there's absolutely no way any of these brainless son of a bitches

3661
03:42:26,049 --> 03:42:27,090
are going to go for that point.

3662
03:42:29,729 --> 03:42:33,409
Okay, this one engineer is really just going for gold.

3663
03:42:34,750 --> 03:42:35,629
We actually capped it.

3664
03:42:36,430 --> 03:42:37,709
How the hell did that happen?

3665
03:42:37,709 --> 03:42:38,110
I don't know.

3666
03:42:38,110 --> 03:42:39,389
Maybe it had something to do with the tank.

3667
03:42:39,389 --> 03:42:45,149
They just crushed that guy.

3668
03:42:45,149 --> 03:42:46,270
It's just bad.

3669
03:42:46,270 --> 03:42:48,430
It just starts running people over.

3670
03:42:48,430 --> 03:42:49,950
They're all going to get stuck on it.

3671
03:42:50,829 --> 03:42:53,620
Blocking the door.

3672
03:42:53,620 --> 03:42:55,059
Yeah, this guy's freaking out.

3673
03:42:55,059 --> 03:42:56,020
Let's get trickstabbed.

3674
03:42:56,020 --> 03:42:56,659
No, no, no.

3675
03:42:57,299 --> 03:42:59,219
Is it actually making its way in?

3676
03:42:59,219 --> 03:42:59,940
No, it's not.

3677
03:42:59,940 --> 03:43:00,260
Is it?

3678
03:43:00,979 --> 03:43:01,700
Please crush them.

3679
03:43:01,700 --> 03:43:03,379
Please crush them.

3680
03:43:03,379 --> 03:43:05,059
You go like crushing them.

3681
03:43:08,579 --> 03:43:09,700
No, it didn't kill them.

3682
03:43:09,700 --> 03:43:10,819
They got in.

3683
03:43:11,299 --> 03:43:12,420
It's fine right here.

3684
03:43:13,540 --> 03:43:15,459
It's just getting fucking run over.

3685
03:43:17,340 --> 03:43:19,420
It's trying to like shoot it with a shotgun.

3686
03:43:31,899 --> 03:43:32,620
I'm going to die.

3687
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:38,159
This should not have happened.

3688
03:43:38,159 --> 03:43:41,139
They're actually doing enough damage to it.

3689
03:43:44,059 --> 03:43:46,700
Here are some engineers on the back of the tanks.

3690
03:43:46,700 --> 03:43:47,100
Yes.

3691
03:43:48,059 --> 03:43:50,420
I'm going to kill it.

3692
03:43:51,059 --> 03:43:53,979
Oh, you didn't think this could get even dumber.

3693
03:43:53,979 --> 03:43:55,180
Elders react.

3694
03:43:56,299 --> 03:43:58,219
They just keep getting run over.

3695
03:44:04,579 --> 03:44:08,559
All right, redo, retake, redo.

3696
03:44:08,559 --> 03:44:10,319
I need like a second before I throw up.

3697
03:44:11,200 --> 03:44:13,649
Why are they all taunting?

3698
03:44:14,370 --> 03:44:18,180
They don't even know what to shoot yet.

3699
03:44:19,809 --> 03:44:21,010
Why are they not shooting you?

3700
03:44:21,010 --> 03:44:22,129
Because the round doesn't start.

3701
03:44:22,129 --> 03:44:23,090
I'm not supposed to be on here.

3702
03:44:23,729 --> 03:44:27,250
Oh, they're that confused about the round not being started yet.

3703
03:44:27,250 --> 03:44:28,850
That they refuse to shoot you.

3704
03:44:30,780 --> 03:44:31,180
What?

3705
03:44:31,180 --> 03:44:31,579
What are they?

3706
03:44:32,540 --> 03:44:33,340
This doesn't make any...

3707
03:44:33,340 --> 03:44:35,100
Wait, oh, I want to see what happens in one second.

3708
03:44:40,379 --> 03:44:43,260
How is anybody on Blue Team going to get anything done?

3709
03:44:44,420 --> 03:44:46,420
You have such a huge advantage.

3710
03:44:47,059 --> 03:44:49,059
Because you're allowed to build your sentries first.

3711
03:44:49,059 --> 03:44:52,819
My guys are being like dumbasses trying to do like leapfrog in the spawn.

3712
03:44:52,819 --> 03:44:55,540
Hey, you could be a little bit more respectful.

3713
03:44:56,340 --> 03:44:57,219
Just wait.

3714
03:44:57,219 --> 03:44:59,379
Wait till this 12 seconds counts down.

3715
03:44:59,940 --> 03:45:03,059
I bet you every single one of these guys just walks out and just gets eaten alive.

3716
03:45:04,459 --> 03:45:05,819
Eaten alive by what?

3717
03:45:05,819 --> 03:45:07,579
We barely have a defense.

3718
03:45:07,579 --> 03:45:08,780
The sentry mosquitoes.

3719
03:45:10,059 --> 03:45:10,860
All right, here we go.

3720
03:45:10,860 --> 03:45:12,620
Why do you need a catchphrase for everything?

3721
03:45:12,620 --> 03:45:13,020
Here we go.

3722
03:45:13,020 --> 03:45:13,579
Let's see what happens.

3723
03:45:14,379 --> 03:45:15,739
That's better than anything else is going to work.

3724
03:45:15,739 --> 03:45:16,620
Because they all backed up.

3725
03:45:16,620 --> 03:45:19,500
Why do you have to have a catchphrase for everything?

3726
03:45:19,500 --> 03:45:20,139
Let's build it back here.

3727
03:45:20,139 --> 03:45:21,739
Let's start getting these teleporters up.

3728
03:45:22,860 --> 03:45:23,659
They're so confused.

3729
03:45:23,659 --> 03:45:26,299
Fioritizing the teleporters over sentries.

3730
03:45:26,299 --> 03:45:28,540
Yeah, they'd rather build teleporters than sentries.

3731
03:45:30,059 --> 03:45:32,940
No, seriously, this was done.

3732
03:45:32,940 --> 03:45:34,299
The joke was over.

3733
03:45:36,379 --> 03:45:38,620
That joke ended so long ago.

3734
03:45:39,899 --> 03:45:44,420
Why do you have to fucking ruin everything?

3735
03:45:50,940 --> 03:45:52,139
Good times.

3736
03:45:52,139 --> 03:45:53,340
Good times, man.

3737
03:45:53,340 --> 03:45:54,459
Good times, man.

3738
03:45:55,180 --> 03:45:56,940
I'm just in the corner over here hanging out.

3739
03:45:56,940 --> 03:45:57,659
Good times.

3740
03:46:02,020 --> 03:46:02,739
All right, guys.

3741
03:46:04,049 --> 03:46:05,889
I have to end the stream.

3742
03:46:16,129 --> 03:46:18,610
Oh, back when I was in my prime.

3743
03:46:18,610 --> 03:46:20,450
I was so, I was so handsome.

3744
03:46:27,780 --> 03:46:35,040
I do apologize again for the extreme internet problems.

3745
03:46:36,059 --> 03:46:40,260
But I'm going to try to get them fixed.

3746
03:46:40,260 --> 03:46:41,139
That's all I can do.

3747
03:46:41,139 --> 03:46:41,860
I'm just going to try.

3748
03:46:44,159 --> 03:46:48,639
Hopefully we can come back strong here without any problems at all on Tuesday.

3749
03:46:48,639 --> 03:46:53,379
If for some reason it's still really bad on Tuesday

3750
03:46:53,379 --> 03:46:55,620
and I can get it fixed on Tuesday, I'll let you know.

3751
03:46:57,620 --> 03:47:00,079
At this point, I don't know.

3752
03:47:00,079 --> 03:47:01,520
I'm shooting for Tuesday.

3753
03:47:01,520 --> 03:47:09,379
So just keep an eye on the sus over the next 24 hours and we'll find out.

3754
03:47:09,379 --> 03:47:12,579
But yeah, this was fucking fun.

3755
03:47:14,819 --> 03:47:20,159
It makes me happy that we can kind of just go back

3756
03:47:20,159 --> 03:47:21,520
and watch some of those old videos.

3757
03:47:22,559 --> 03:47:25,180
You guys are fucking awesome.

3758
03:47:25,180 --> 03:47:27,540
It's been a long time.

3759
03:47:27,540 --> 03:47:29,540
It's been fucking almost 10 goddamn years.

3760
03:47:30,180 --> 03:47:31,469
Holy shit.

3761
03:47:32,829 --> 03:47:37,469
Oh, but let us say good night for now.

3762
03:47:37,469 --> 03:47:39,860
See you again possibly on Tuesday.

3763
03:47:39,860 --> 03:47:41,649
I will keep you updated.

3764
03:47:41,649 --> 03:47:45,090
I will probably make a tweet about it just to make sure everyone knows what's going on.

3765
03:47:45,090 --> 03:47:47,440
Thanks for watching.

3766
03:47:47,440 --> 03:48:00,879
As always, at least we salvaged it, right?

3767
03:48:00,879 --> 03:48:04,399
So let's go to the bits from earlier today.

3768
03:48:05,040 --> 03:48:09,920
See you soon.

3769
03:48:10,479 --> 03:48:10,879
Take care.

3770
03:48:14,379 --> 03:48:16,219
If you thought that was fun, we can do it again.

3771
03:48:16,219 --> 03:48:19,579
I just, I don't really do a whole lot of kind of react

3772
03:48:20,059 --> 03:48:23,340
or watch kind of videos on stream type of stuff.

3773
03:48:24,059 --> 03:48:25,969
But every once in a while, it's fine.

3774
03:48:25,969 --> 03:48:28,770
You know, do that like once every couple months or something once a month.

3775
03:48:29,569 --> 03:48:31,540
We'll see.

3776
03:48:31,540 --> 03:48:32,020
That was fun.

3777
03:48:32,579 --> 03:48:36,030
So let's head back to four or five hours ago here.

3778
03:48:37,059 --> 03:48:40,180
We had, we had a lot of community subs.

3779
03:48:40,180 --> 03:48:42,620
We had a bunch from, we'd five from Kazzy.

3780
03:48:43,180 --> 03:48:44,620
We had five from soup store.

3781
03:48:46,590 --> 03:48:47,549
Thank you for those.

3782
03:48:47,549 --> 03:48:52,909
We had three dollars from, from thanks for the FAMAS.

3783
03:48:53,709 --> 03:48:55,549
Thanks for the three bucks.

3784
03:48:55,549 --> 03:48:59,489
It's been, I've been watching you for so many years.

3785
03:48:59,489 --> 03:49:00,690
It's needs to do with retrospective.

3786
03:49:00,690 --> 03:49:03,010
Yeah, that's the first time I've watched those videos

3787
03:49:03,010 --> 03:49:04,610
since at least a few years.

3788
03:49:04,610 --> 03:49:05,969
So it's cool.

3789
03:49:07,100 --> 03:49:08,540
But thank you for the three dollars.

3790
03:49:08,540 --> 03:49:09,659
First time I've ever seen a stream.

3791
03:49:09,659 --> 03:49:12,379
Thanks for being, thanks to being British.

3792
03:49:12,379 --> 03:49:15,579
But thank you for helping me through a lot in the past few years.

3793
03:49:15,579 --> 03:49:16,139
Much love.

3794
03:49:17,280 --> 03:49:20,430
Thanks to being British, British.

3795
03:49:32,079 --> 03:49:33,760
Oh, the time zone, right?

3796
03:49:33,760 --> 03:49:34,979
The time zone.

3797
03:49:34,979 --> 03:49:36,659
Oh, I was like, wait, what?

3798
03:49:36,659 --> 03:49:38,690
I was like, I'm British, am I?

3799
03:49:40,139 --> 03:49:41,500
Multi trip, thanks to the three dollars.

3800
03:49:41,500 --> 03:49:43,420
Have some money to make you feel better.

3801
03:49:43,420 --> 03:49:43,979
No, I'm sorry.

3802
03:49:43,979 --> 03:49:46,459
I can't, I can't let it get to me anymore.

3803
03:49:46,459 --> 03:49:48,299
You know, I can't like, it's going to happen.

3804
03:49:49,020 --> 03:49:52,799
I'd rather just relax and just deal with it, right?

3805
03:49:52,799 --> 03:49:56,959
That I, what's going to happen if I get fucking angry and furious?

3806
03:49:56,959 --> 03:49:58,239
No, I can't believe that shit.

3807
03:49:59,379 --> 03:50:00,420
It's not going to do anything.

3808
03:50:00,420 --> 03:50:06,219
So just make what you can with what you got, right?

3809
03:50:06,219 --> 03:50:07,500
That's what you can do.

3810
03:50:07,500 --> 03:50:10,340
I'm not going to let it bother me.

3811
03:50:12,500 --> 03:50:14,100
And it turned out to be a fun stream anyway.

3812
03:50:14,100 --> 03:50:15,889
So that's fine.

3813
03:50:17,090 --> 03:50:20,770
Sam and Max though, that's a, we got to figure out where I'm going to put that.

3814
03:50:21,329 --> 03:50:23,809
Because I want to do Garden Flipper DLC.

3815
03:50:23,809 --> 03:50:26,540
When I, the first stream when I come back is probably,

3816
03:50:31,659 --> 03:50:34,459
we'll probably have to make, I don't know, it's going to be hard.

3817
03:50:34,459 --> 03:50:36,540
I'm going to, I'll put it somewhere next week.

3818
03:50:36,540 --> 03:50:40,530
So we're going to do Garden Flipper when we come back.

3819
03:50:40,530 --> 03:50:44,049
And then I want to play those episodes in Sam and Max,

3820
03:50:44,049 --> 03:50:46,209
because we just kind of get screwed over today.

3821
03:50:46,209 --> 03:50:52,180
We'll figure it out.

3822
03:50:52,180 --> 03:50:55,329
We'll figure it out, don't worry.

3823
03:50:55,329 --> 03:50:57,809
But thank you to some guy for the 15 bucks.

3824
03:50:57,809 --> 03:50:58,530
Thank you, some guy.

3825
03:50:59,409 --> 03:51:02,370
I got screwed by the last course of this semester last Friday pretty hard.

3826
03:51:02,930 --> 03:51:04,690
I probably failed it as well.

3827
03:51:04,690 --> 03:51:06,370
At least you put a smile on my face

3828
03:51:06,370 --> 03:51:09,010
due to the fact that you are screwed even harder by cocks.

3829
03:51:15,819 --> 03:51:17,100
But thank you for the 15 dollars.

3830
03:51:18,659 --> 03:51:21,549
I'm not sure what, what course it was,

3831
03:51:22,620 --> 03:51:26,500
or what classes are, you know, fucking with you.

3832
03:51:26,500 --> 03:51:31,090
But all you can do is, you know, if you have, you know,

3833
03:51:31,090 --> 03:51:33,809
some bad grades or bad GPA or had something happen,

3834
03:51:34,450 --> 03:51:36,479
you just got to keep doing it.

3835
03:51:36,479 --> 03:51:38,079
Keep, try, you know.

3836
03:51:39,950 --> 03:51:40,989
Do what you can.

3837
03:51:40,989 --> 03:51:54,100
I had a 4.0 semester.

3838
03:51:54,100 --> 03:51:55,620
Well, aren't you Mr. Smart?

3839
03:51:59,389 --> 03:52:02,670
I had a couple of spots in college where I didn't do very well.

3840
03:52:04,110 --> 03:52:10,370
I was just borderline above what's it called?

3841
03:52:11,180 --> 03:52:11,979
Probation, right?

3842
03:52:13,069 --> 03:52:14,350
Academic probation.

3843
03:52:14,350 --> 03:52:17,229
I was like maybe, I was like,

3844
03:52:17,229 --> 03:52:20,190
I was probably two or three tests away,

3845
03:52:20,750 --> 03:52:22,989
or one letter grade away from being on academic probation.

3846
03:52:23,870 --> 03:52:28,860
But then I, I kind of got myself situated.

3847
03:52:28,860 --> 03:52:30,059
I started to do better.

3848
03:52:30,059 --> 03:52:32,690
I had like a 3.0, I think, total,

3849
03:52:32,690 --> 03:52:35,489
or like a 2.9 or like a 3.1 or something, whatever it was.

3850
03:52:35,489 --> 03:52:39,709
But all you can do is just keep going.

3851
03:52:39,709 --> 03:52:42,750
There's no secret formula, right?

3852
03:52:42,750 --> 03:52:52,639
But yeah, I've had my fair share of troubles in school.

3853
03:52:53,280 --> 03:52:59,260
But thank you for the 15 dollars.

3854
03:52:59,260 --> 03:52:59,819
Wish you luck.

3855
03:53:01,520 --> 03:53:02,799
Hopefully you can figure it out.

3856
03:53:03,680 --> 03:53:04,079
Thank you.

3857
03:53:05,790 --> 03:53:07,309
Son of Genova, thanks for the 250.

3858
03:53:07,309 --> 03:53:08,750
This was one of your best moments.

3859
03:53:09,389 --> 03:53:10,670
This was one of the best moments.

3860
03:53:14,690 --> 03:53:18,430
Oh, this is the...

3861
03:53:30,319 --> 03:53:30,719
That's true.

3862
03:53:30,719 --> 03:53:31,440
That's true.

3863
03:53:31,440 --> 03:53:33,760
You will quiet, everyone will be quiet and say,

3864
03:53:33,760 --> 03:53:34,319
what is he doing?

3865
03:53:34,319 --> 03:53:34,959
Because you're the teacher.

3866
03:53:34,959 --> 03:53:35,760
You're not supposed to do that.

3867
03:53:36,559 --> 03:53:39,120
The teacher is not supposed to make the weird noises.

3868
03:53:39,120 --> 03:53:40,079
The kids are.

3869
03:53:40,079 --> 03:53:41,840
So that's just like, why did he just do that?

3870
03:53:42,719 --> 03:53:43,200
Silence.

3871
03:53:44,239 --> 03:53:44,799
Okay.

3872
03:53:44,799 --> 03:53:46,159
So now that I have your attention,

3873
03:53:46,879 --> 03:53:51,360
but thank you for the 250.

3874
03:53:51,360 --> 03:53:52,639
And that like shitty mic,

3875
03:53:55,549 --> 03:53:56,590
like was so bad.

3876
03:53:57,389 --> 03:53:58,989
That was the pre-move mic.

3877
03:54:00,799 --> 03:54:03,280
Thank you, Frost, for the five dollars.

3878
03:54:03,280 --> 03:54:04,639
I hope chat doesn't bother you too much

3879
03:54:04,639 --> 03:54:06,159
when internet stuff is happening.

3880
03:54:06,159 --> 03:54:07,040
I watch no matter what

3881
03:54:07,040 --> 03:54:08,479
because you are quite a comedic talent.

3882
03:54:09,819 --> 03:54:11,500
Thanks for the five dollars, Frost Tro.

3883
03:54:13,870 --> 03:54:14,350
No, it...

3884
03:54:15,069 --> 03:54:16,750
Chat doesn't bother me when that happens.

3885
03:54:17,549 --> 03:54:21,840
It bothers me that I want the stream to be fun

3886
03:54:21,840 --> 03:54:24,479
and watchable and I don't want it to buffer

3887
03:54:24,479 --> 03:54:25,520
and cut out on people.

3888
03:54:25,520 --> 03:54:29,280
And when it happens, I get frustrated at that

3889
03:54:29,840 --> 03:54:31,440
because I want the stream to be good.

3890
03:54:31,440 --> 03:54:32,479
I want the stream to be...

3891
03:54:33,200 --> 03:54:36,399
I can pay attention and we can go through something

3892
03:54:36,399 --> 03:54:38,879
and you don't have to worry about some other force

3893
03:54:40,209 --> 03:54:42,129
negatively affecting your stream.

3894
03:54:45,120 --> 03:54:47,920
So no, chat messing around.

3895
03:54:47,920 --> 03:54:48,799
And no, that's not...

3896
03:54:49,860 --> 03:54:50,500
That's not the issue.

3897
03:54:50,500 --> 03:54:53,729
The issue is I want the stream to be watchable.

3898
03:54:53,729 --> 03:54:55,649
And if it isn't, then I have a problem

3899
03:54:55,649 --> 03:54:59,100
because that's what I'm doing here.

3900
03:54:59,100 --> 03:55:02,670
But I expect it to be fixed in the next couple of days.

3901
03:55:02,670 --> 03:55:02,909
I do.

3902
03:55:02,909 --> 03:55:05,250
I really do.

3903
03:55:05,329 --> 03:55:06,290
I have somebody...

3904
03:55:06,290 --> 03:55:09,170
I have a supervisor at Cox that every time there's a problem like this,

3905
03:55:09,170 --> 03:55:11,170
it takes like a week or two, but they get it done.

3906
03:55:11,729 --> 03:55:12,610
They fix it.

3907
03:55:12,610 --> 03:55:16,479
It's over and it's good for like three months.

3908
03:55:16,479 --> 03:55:18,719
So I'm confident that they will get it done.

3909
03:55:18,719 --> 03:55:19,280
I am.

3910
03:55:19,280 --> 03:55:27,360
At least I hope so.

3911
03:55:27,360 --> 03:55:28,239
Otherwise, that would be bad.

3912
03:55:30,059 --> 03:55:30,860
But thank you, Frost.

3913
03:55:33,579 --> 03:55:36,139
Thank you, Mr. Atigan, for these six dollars here.

3914
03:55:38,059 --> 03:55:39,659
Jermyn, when he's upset and angry,

3915
03:55:39,659 --> 03:55:41,739
don't forget about the baby running into the cabinets

3916
03:55:41,739 --> 03:55:42,540
in layers of fear.

3917
03:55:43,700 --> 03:55:44,180
That's true.

3918
03:55:46,209 --> 03:55:47,329
That was unbelievable.

3919
03:55:48,829 --> 03:55:51,309
That may have been the strangest thing I've ever captured

3920
03:55:52,190 --> 03:55:53,069
in front of my face.

3921
03:55:59,969 --> 03:56:02,129
And then they say, go box italics.

3922
03:56:02,129 --> 03:56:03,329
Why would I do that?

3923
03:56:03,329 --> 03:56:05,090
That's not...

3924
03:56:05,090 --> 03:56:05,329
No.

3925
03:56:10,579 --> 03:56:12,420
Thank you, Heldrich, for the five dollars.

3926
03:56:12,420 --> 03:56:13,780
Hey, Jerm, I've been watching for years.

3927
03:56:14,860 --> 03:56:15,979
Thank you for that.

3928
03:56:15,979 --> 03:56:18,299
I'm so happy to see how much success you've had.

3929
03:56:18,299 --> 03:56:19,979
You're an inspiration, my dude.

3930
03:56:19,979 --> 03:56:21,500
Keep up the good work, PS.

3931
03:56:21,500 --> 03:56:25,860
Alter Ego Mail had me crying laughing.

3932
03:56:25,860 --> 03:56:30,530
I'm glad it did because it was fucking crazy.

3933
03:56:30,530 --> 03:56:31,840
But thank you so much.

3934
03:56:32,399 --> 03:56:33,600
Glad to have you for that long.

3935
03:56:36,899 --> 03:56:38,420
Thank you so much for the five dollars as well.

3936
03:56:42,959 --> 03:56:44,799
Mentosium, thanks for the 250.

3937
03:56:45,360 --> 03:56:47,139
Any updates on Movie Night 2?

3938
03:56:50,610 --> 03:56:51,409
No.

3939
03:56:51,409 --> 03:56:54,260
I don't really have an update for you.

3940
03:56:54,260 --> 03:56:55,540
There's a lot of things

3941
03:56:55,540 --> 03:56:57,459
that I'm trying to do at the same time.

3942
03:56:58,260 --> 03:57:01,739
And that kind of fell backwards

3943
03:57:02,379 --> 03:57:03,819
behind a couple of the other things

3944
03:57:03,819 --> 03:57:05,899
that I am putting higher on the priority list.

3945
03:57:10,159 --> 03:57:12,239
So there are other things that have taken priority

3946
03:57:12,239 --> 03:57:14,000
from that second Movie Night

3947
03:57:14,000 --> 03:57:14,879
to like set it up.

3948
03:57:15,440 --> 03:57:23,950
Play Monster Rancher DS.

3949
03:57:26,579 --> 03:57:28,260
Yeah, I got to figure out how to cap DS

3950
03:57:28,260 --> 03:57:31,379
because there's a lot of games on DS to play

3951
03:57:31,379 --> 03:57:32,180
and mess around with.

3952
03:57:32,819 --> 03:57:37,389
Jerma lied about Movie Night 2.

3953
03:57:37,389 --> 03:57:37,870
Here it comes.

3954
03:57:37,870 --> 03:57:38,430
Make another one.

3955
03:57:38,430 --> 03:57:39,149
Make another one.

3956
03:57:39,149 --> 03:57:40,909
No, we'll eventually, we'll probably,

3957
03:57:41,790 --> 03:57:43,469
I think we'll eventually do it.

3958
03:57:43,469 --> 03:57:47,459
That was the most viewed stream ever.

3959
03:57:50,639 --> 03:57:51,440
Yeah, I know.

3960
03:57:51,440 --> 03:57:54,879
But it's important to me

3961
03:57:55,520 --> 03:57:56,899
that even if something,

3962
03:57:56,899 --> 03:57:58,180
let's say something really works

3963
03:57:58,180 --> 03:57:59,620
and it's really like, for instance like that

3964
03:57:59,620 --> 03:58:00,739
and like the Jerma Rumbles,

3965
03:58:00,739 --> 03:58:01,540
there's a lot,

3966
03:58:01,540 --> 03:58:02,739
there was probably eight,

3967
03:58:02,739 --> 03:58:05,700
9,000 people watching the last Jerma Rumble.

3968
03:58:06,659 --> 03:58:08,739
Just because an audience is there that's large,

3969
03:58:09,809 --> 03:58:11,729
I want to make sure that it's done right.

3970
03:58:11,729 --> 03:58:14,049
And I don't want to just keep doing it just to do it

3971
03:58:14,049 --> 03:58:16,209
because I know that people will come and watch it.

3972
03:58:16,850 --> 03:58:18,659
I want to make sure that it's fun

3973
03:58:18,659 --> 03:58:20,020
and that it's worth doing

3974
03:58:20,020 --> 03:58:21,459
and that people will think it's fun

3975
03:58:21,459 --> 03:58:23,059
and it's not just something that I'm pumping out

3976
03:58:24,219 --> 03:58:26,530
on a, just to get it out there, right?

3977
03:58:27,260 --> 03:58:29,020
That's my philosophy for a lot of things.

3978
03:58:29,020 --> 03:58:33,020
Jerma lied about picking up Kim.

3979
03:58:33,659 --> 03:58:36,450
So maybe it would be easy

3980
03:58:36,450 --> 03:58:37,969
just to throw together that Movie Night

3981
03:58:38,850 --> 03:58:41,280
It's almost like I want it to be

3982
03:58:41,920 --> 03:58:45,250
the way that I want it to be.

3983
03:58:45,250 --> 03:58:46,850
It's weird to talk about.

3984
03:58:51,069 --> 03:58:52,270
When are you going to stream with Joel?

3985
03:58:54,479 --> 03:58:57,340
I'm not sure, there's two Joels.

3986
03:58:57,340 --> 03:58:58,299
Talking about Joel,

3987
03:58:58,299 --> 03:59:00,219
like the Joel that I just hung out with

3988
03:59:00,219 --> 03:59:07,940
or Joel the trash talking wrestling.

3989
03:59:07,940 --> 03:59:15,459
Yeah, we talked, he got really busy.

3990
03:59:15,459 --> 03:59:16,979
So yeah, you're talking about,

3991
03:59:16,979 --> 03:59:18,979
you're talking about Varg.

3992
03:59:18,979 --> 03:59:20,819
Yeah, he got really busy.

3993
03:59:20,819 --> 03:59:22,420
And he said, I'm really busy.

3994
03:59:22,420 --> 03:59:23,459
I'm sorry I was working.

3995
03:59:23,459 --> 03:59:24,500
He was working on a bunch of stuff.

3996
03:59:24,500 --> 03:59:25,940
So we just said, all right,

3997
03:59:25,940 --> 03:59:27,059
we'll figure it out some other time.

3998
03:59:27,860 --> 03:59:32,239
But he had a lot of projects going on at the time.

3999
03:59:32,799 --> 03:59:34,739
So I'll probably throw the line out

4000
03:59:34,739 --> 03:59:35,540
eventually here soon.

4001
03:59:38,260 --> 03:59:39,219
We were thinking maybe,

4002
03:59:42,270 --> 03:59:45,389
no, I'll keep that under wraps.

4003
03:59:45,389 --> 03:59:50,899
But there you'll probably see something interesting.

4004
03:59:50,899 --> 03:59:54,430
Co-op penis stream.

4005
03:59:54,430 --> 03:59:55,709
Why did I read that out loud?

4006
03:59:55,709 --> 03:59:58,959
And second of all, what are you talking about?

4007
03:59:58,959 --> 03:59:59,760
I don't know why I do it.

4008
03:59:59,760 --> 04:00:02,479
I'm telling you, I'm so unableable.

4009
04:00:02,479 --> 04:00:03,520
People could just say that.

4010
04:00:05,170 --> 04:00:06,049
I don't, did some stuff.

4011
04:00:06,049 --> 04:00:07,889
The coffee cheeto, like I just,

4012
04:00:07,889 --> 04:00:09,569
it's just, I have to say it.

4013
04:00:09,569 --> 04:00:12,770
I am like, so you can lead me

4014
04:00:12,770 --> 04:00:15,889
like with a carrot on a stick into a cliff.

4015
04:00:15,889 --> 04:00:16,930
I will fall off of it.

4016
04:00:18,750 --> 04:00:22,770
I'm very unableable.

4017
04:00:22,770 --> 04:00:25,379
But yeah, we'll see.

4018
04:00:25,379 --> 04:00:26,100
We'll see what happens.

4019
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:29,280
Cad, thank you Cad.

4020
04:00:29,280 --> 04:00:31,840
BTV, resident video game developer.

4021
04:00:32,559 --> 04:00:33,520
Thanks for the 250.

4022
04:00:34,319 --> 04:00:36,639
Look at this ego maniac watching his old videos

4023
04:00:36,639 --> 04:00:37,920
in front of 4,300 people.

4024
04:00:37,920 --> 04:00:39,440
I bet he stares in the mirror for hours

4025
04:00:39,440 --> 04:00:40,159
talking to himself.

4026
04:00:40,159 --> 04:00:40,879
Yes, I do.

4027
04:00:40,879 --> 04:00:41,680
Yes, that does happen.

4028
04:00:43,979 --> 04:00:45,819
I will just have full conversations

4029
04:00:45,819 --> 04:00:46,700
with myself in the mirror.

4030
04:00:46,700 --> 04:00:47,739
I do it like all the time.

4031
04:00:59,790 --> 04:01:00,770
Full.

4032
04:01:00,770 --> 04:01:05,700
A full, into the mirror, full frontal.

4033
04:01:05,700 --> 04:01:09,219
And I just do a play to myself.

4034
04:01:09,219 --> 04:01:10,979
And I'm the actor and I'm the audience.

4035
04:01:15,569 --> 04:01:16,290
I knew it.

4036
04:01:20,989 --> 04:01:22,750
He's insane.

4037
04:01:22,750 --> 04:01:27,780
Thank you though.

4038
04:01:31,139 --> 04:01:33,860
Hey, thank you Lula Moore for the five dollars.

4039
04:01:34,739 --> 04:01:36,579
Please do the layers of fear video.

4040
04:01:38,770 --> 04:01:41,090
Um, not right now.

4041
04:01:41,090 --> 04:01:41,969
Not right now.

4042
04:01:41,969 --> 04:01:43,809
I've got to get out of here.

4043
04:01:45,540 --> 04:01:55,899
Save it for another time.

4044
04:01:55,899 --> 04:01:57,659
Thank you to Frodeon Weapon for the 350.

4045
04:01:57,659 --> 04:01:58,379
Thank you, Frodeon.

4046
04:02:01,219 --> 04:02:02,659
Not to be an attention hog,

4047
04:02:02,659 --> 04:02:05,299
but you taking my stream name idea made my day.

4048
04:02:06,420 --> 04:02:07,219
Dear my heart.

4049
04:02:07,219 --> 04:02:08,500
Plus, as much as I love Sam and Max,

4050
04:02:08,500 --> 04:02:10,180
reminiscing over some of your greatest videos

4051
04:02:10,180 --> 04:02:11,139
is even better.

4052
04:02:11,139 --> 04:02:12,899
Hope your internet issue gets resolved.

4053
04:02:12,899 --> 04:02:13,540
Happy Sunday.

4054
04:02:14,100 --> 04:02:15,819
Happy Sunday to you as well.

4055
04:02:17,299 --> 04:02:20,909
And yeah, I'm good.

4056
04:02:20,909 --> 04:02:21,309
I'm good.

4057
04:02:22,190 --> 04:02:23,340
It'll get fixed.

4058
04:02:23,899 --> 04:02:26,030
Just got to deal with it for now.

4059
04:02:26,030 --> 04:02:27,149
And we'll get back to normal.

4060
04:02:27,709 --> 04:02:30,610
As of hopefully Monday or Tuesday or so.

4061
04:02:31,170 --> 04:02:34,340
Or if Wednesday, Tuesday,

4062
04:02:34,340 --> 04:02:35,860
I'm going to try as hard as I'm going to.

4063
04:02:35,860 --> 04:02:38,260
I'm going to get up as early as possible tomorrow

4064
04:02:38,260 --> 04:02:39,700
and make like three phone calls.

4065
04:02:40,420 --> 04:02:43,579
I'm going to be phone call businessman tomorrow.

4066
04:02:43,579 --> 04:02:44,219
Just juicy.

4067
04:02:56,260 --> 04:02:58,020
Frontal mirror stream.

4068
04:02:58,020 --> 04:02:59,780
And then I will be removed from the platform.

4069
04:03:00,500 --> 04:03:01,379
But thank you, Frodeon.

4070
04:03:01,940 --> 04:03:04,180
Thank you, Hans Beets for the five community subs.

4071
04:03:04,180 --> 04:03:04,739
Thanks, Hans.

4072
04:03:05,739 --> 04:03:07,739
Five subs on top of all the other ones

4073
04:03:07,739 --> 04:03:08,459
that we're on tonight.

4074
04:03:08,459 --> 04:03:08,780
Thank you.

4075
04:03:12,590 --> 04:03:15,149
CadBTV, again 250, would you?

4076
04:03:16,049 --> 04:03:18,850
Who would you shit your pants for on stream?

4077
04:03:20,180 --> 04:03:20,579
Nobody.

4078
04:03:22,100 --> 04:03:22,899
No, but no one.

4079
04:03:23,459 --> 04:03:24,350
Maybe my mother.

4080
04:03:26,500 --> 04:03:28,020
If my mother needed me to stream with her

4081
04:03:28,020 --> 04:03:30,979
or something, it would be my mom or...

4082
04:03:32,459 --> 04:03:33,100
That's probably it.

4083
04:03:42,739 --> 04:03:43,299
Not Kim?

4084
04:03:45,020 --> 04:03:45,420
No, I...

4085
04:03:47,600 --> 04:03:49,600
No, there's context here.

4086
04:03:49,600 --> 04:03:50,879
There's context here.

4087
04:03:51,760 --> 04:03:52,879
There's context.

4088
04:04:00,829 --> 04:04:02,350
Thank you for the 250.

4089
04:04:02,350 --> 04:04:02,909
Appreciate it.

4090
04:04:11,620 --> 04:04:17,760
But thank you, Sticks Renegade for the 250.

4091
04:04:17,760 --> 04:04:19,579
Hey, Jerma, with your permission,

4092
04:04:19,579 --> 04:04:22,940
I want to custom order one car sticker of your Jerma J

4093
04:04:22,940 --> 04:04:26,059
to put on my sticker bombed Corolla

4094
04:04:26,059 --> 04:04:27,899
from those sticker maker websites.

4095
04:04:27,899 --> 04:04:28,780
Is that okay with you?

4096
04:04:28,780 --> 04:04:32,139
If so, I can show you the car when I get the sticker.

4097
04:04:32,139 --> 04:04:33,579
If not, that's completely understandable.

4098
04:04:34,379 --> 04:04:38,879
Oh, you want to have...

4099
04:04:38,879 --> 04:04:40,239
Oh, I see what you're saying.

4100
04:04:40,239 --> 04:04:43,280
I'm going to call my lawyer

4101
04:04:43,280 --> 04:04:44,319
to see what he says about that.

4102
04:04:48,450 --> 04:04:49,889
No, that was 9-1-1.

4103
04:04:49,889 --> 04:04:51,010
That's the wrong number.

4104
04:04:52,270 --> 04:04:54,190
That would not be who I would call.

4105
04:04:55,149 --> 04:04:58,270
Hey, nobody was going to steal my copyright.

4106
04:05:07,040 --> 04:05:07,840
Oh, this is the...

4107
04:05:08,479 --> 04:05:08,959
Yeah, you get...

4108
04:05:08,959 --> 04:05:12,079
Well, let's forward you to that department,

4109
04:05:12,079 --> 04:05:14,219
the copyright police.

4110
04:05:21,819 --> 04:05:23,819
Yeah, I mean, I don't have any stickers or anything.

4111
04:05:25,020 --> 04:05:27,979
I might actually make some stuff like that for fun

4112
04:05:28,700 --> 04:05:31,120
because I have that teespring store

4113
04:05:31,120 --> 04:05:34,239
and you can make hats, mugs, socks.

4114
04:05:35,889 --> 04:05:37,889
Stickers, you can do that.

4115
04:05:37,889 --> 04:05:42,559
So there probably will be more of that added just for fun.

4116
04:05:43,360 --> 04:05:47,059
I don't expect thousands of people to be like,

4117
04:05:47,059 --> 04:05:48,500
I have my merch, buy it.

4118
04:05:49,139 --> 04:05:51,620
But it doesn't cost anything for me to do that.

4119
04:05:52,659 --> 04:05:54,340
So I'm sure I would do it at some point.

4120
04:05:57,549 --> 04:05:57,870
Pins?

4121
04:05:57,870 --> 04:05:58,750
I wonder if they have pins.

4122
04:05:58,750 --> 04:05:59,309
I'll take a look.

4123
04:05:59,309 --> 04:06:01,309
Does Teespring do pins on their stores?

4124
04:06:01,870 --> 04:06:05,760
I don't know.

4125
04:06:05,760 --> 04:06:07,120
Dr. Clay, thanks for the 250.

4126
04:06:07,120 --> 04:06:08,159
I did some research for you.

4127
04:06:08,159 --> 04:06:09,680
Here's the origin of that sound.

4128
04:06:11,709 --> 04:06:12,510
Really?

4129
04:06:12,510 --> 04:06:15,920
This is from the BattleBots.

4130
04:06:16,000 --> 04:06:22,530
That is where that's from.

4131
04:06:23,090 --> 04:06:25,870
Why would you make that a hit sound?

4132
04:06:26,430 --> 04:06:28,739
Of all the things, why?

4133
04:06:29,459 --> 04:06:36,860
It was just me going, oh,

4134
04:06:38,139 --> 04:06:40,670
there wasn't anything spectacular about that.

4135
04:06:49,149 --> 04:06:51,229
Thank you to Talos for the 10 bucks.

4136
04:06:51,950 --> 04:06:53,950
Talos03, thanks for 10 dollars.

4137
04:06:54,510 --> 04:06:57,120
As soon as you gave us that heartfelt speech

4138
04:06:57,120 --> 04:06:59,120
about streaming still being fun after all these years,

4139
04:06:59,120 --> 04:07:00,239
I went out and got some bits.

4140
04:07:00,879 --> 04:07:02,479
You've got me through some tough times, Jerma.

4141
04:07:02,479 --> 04:07:04,079
I can always count on you to make me laugh.

4142
04:07:04,639 --> 04:07:08,540
It is still fun.

4143
04:07:09,889 --> 04:07:11,889
That's why I tend to get upset

4144
04:07:11,889 --> 04:07:15,840
when something gets in the way.

4145
04:07:19,979 --> 04:07:21,819
We have a pretty large community here now,

4146
04:07:21,819 --> 04:07:23,979
and I want it to be fun.

4147
04:07:23,979 --> 04:07:25,180
I don't want it to be like,

4148
04:07:25,180 --> 04:07:26,540
oh, here we go.

4149
04:07:26,540 --> 04:07:27,579
Look at this.

4150
04:07:27,579 --> 04:07:27,979
Look at me.

4151
04:07:29,420 --> 04:07:32,540
120,000 drop frames, cocks.

4152
04:07:33,360 --> 04:07:34,159
And yeah, it's a joke.

4153
04:07:34,159 --> 04:07:37,200
I know you guys don't mean half of it sometimes,

4154
04:07:37,200 --> 04:07:38,079
and it's not a big deal,

4155
04:07:38,079 --> 04:07:39,920
but it is to me because I want it to be good,

4156
04:07:39,920 --> 04:07:41,760
and I want you to enjoy every second of the stream.

4157
04:07:41,760 --> 04:07:42,319
I don't want it to be,

4158
04:07:43,280 --> 04:07:45,010
you know, well, you know,

4159
04:07:45,010 --> 04:07:46,930
15% of that stream was fucked.

4160
04:07:47,569 --> 04:07:49,200
Couldn't even watch it.

4161
04:07:49,920 --> 04:07:58,700
So it means a lot to me that I'm able to do it,

4162
04:07:58,700 --> 04:08:00,059
and it's able that I can do the things

4163
04:08:00,059 --> 04:08:01,100
that I want to do that day.

4164
04:08:01,899 --> 04:08:05,219
But it is still a blast every time.

4165
04:08:05,219 --> 04:08:06,979
I still have a great fucking time,

4166
04:08:06,979 --> 04:08:09,139
which means that I'm going to keep doing it.

4167
04:08:11,649 --> 04:08:15,809
I'm happy that you find the streams worth watching,

4168
04:08:16,450 --> 04:08:18,129
even when there are problems like this,

4169
04:08:18,129 --> 04:08:19,090
like that happened today

4170
04:08:19,090 --> 04:08:21,250
with the technical internet kind of stuff.

4171
04:08:21,889 --> 04:08:26,209
Even still, that you're able to stick with me there

4172
04:08:26,209 --> 04:08:26,930
and stick through that.

4173
04:08:27,569 --> 04:08:27,889
Thank you.

4174
04:08:32,420 --> 04:08:33,940
It's worth the pain.

4175
04:08:33,940 --> 04:08:34,659
I hope so.

4176
04:08:36,750 --> 04:08:37,229
But thank you.

4177
04:08:43,170 --> 04:08:45,090
Thank you Skeleton Toast for the $5.

4178
04:08:45,809 --> 04:08:48,930
Hey, Jerma, I don't you remember,

4179
04:08:48,930 --> 04:08:50,450
but nearly a year ago I asked you

4180
04:08:50,450 --> 04:08:52,850
for some words of encouragement, of courage,

4181
04:08:52,850 --> 04:08:54,930
before I went into surgery for my brain condition.

4182
04:08:55,489 --> 04:08:57,329
Due to my meds and constant doctor's appointments,

4183
04:08:57,969 --> 04:09:00,290
I've never really gotten the chance to catch your streams.

4184
04:09:00,290 --> 04:09:02,850
So to say thank you and let you know

4185
04:09:02,850 --> 04:09:04,049
that everything went fine.

4186
04:09:05,340 --> 04:09:06,940
Not cured, but hey, not dead.

4187
04:09:07,659 --> 04:09:09,100
Thanks for helping me get through that day.

4188
04:09:09,100 --> 04:09:10,860
And whenever it gets too much,

4189
04:09:10,860 --> 04:09:13,659
I'm pretty sure the Fat Engie

4190
04:09:13,659 --> 04:09:17,200
was the first video of yours that I ever saw.

4191
04:09:17,200 --> 04:09:19,440
Well, I'm fucking incredibly happy

4192
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:21,440
that you're all right.

4193
04:09:21,440 --> 04:09:34,049
And that video was, that game was so good.

4194
04:09:41,600 --> 04:09:48,690
I'm so grounded and thankful that somebody,

4195
04:09:50,659 --> 04:09:52,340
that I'm helping you through that.

4196
04:09:52,899 --> 04:09:58,620
That's, I'm glad you're fucking all right.

4197
04:09:58,620 --> 04:10:10,379
Thank you so much for the $5 and stick with it.

4198
04:10:10,940 --> 04:10:16,340
Much love to you, for real.

4199
04:10:16,899 --> 04:10:25,379
That was Skeleton Toast.

4200
04:10:37,520 --> 04:10:42,459
Thank you so much to Zalaski for the $2.50.

4201
04:10:42,459 --> 04:10:45,979
Hey, Jerma, why were, why were you the friend

4202
04:10:45,979 --> 04:10:47,739
who shows you their favorite movie

4203
04:10:47,739 --> 04:10:49,979
and says this is the best part during the whole movie?

4204
04:10:53,489 --> 04:10:55,569
Oh, yeah, I was, I was going like,

4205
04:10:57,569 --> 04:10:59,010
yeah, but here's the thing though.

4206
04:10:59,809 --> 04:11:02,209
But like most of us have seen the movie, right?

4207
04:11:02,209 --> 04:11:03,569
We've all seen the movie.

4208
04:11:03,569 --> 04:11:05,489
So you and I are looking,

4209
04:11:05,489 --> 04:11:08,049
are looking at each other and we're both,

4210
04:11:08,049 --> 04:11:10,129
yeah, here, yeah, here it comes.

4211
04:11:10,850 --> 04:11:12,270
You know, you've seen the movie too.

4212
04:11:12,270 --> 04:11:13,149
So we both like are like,

4213
04:11:13,149 --> 04:11:14,350
yeah, this is it, right here, man.

4214
04:11:22,340 --> 04:11:24,819
And I complained about that person like two weeks ago.

4215
04:11:24,819 --> 04:11:25,620
That's fucking funny.

4216
04:11:28,290 --> 04:11:29,409
Let's get the credits on the screen.

4217
04:11:30,049 --> 04:11:37,569
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh, there they go.

4218
04:11:38,370 --> 04:11:42,459
Hey, Easy Peep, Easy Peep 81.

4219
04:11:42,459 --> 04:11:44,780
That's a, that's a pretty good subscription

4220
04:11:44,780 --> 04:11:46,620
considering we watched that video.

4221
04:11:56,879 --> 04:11:58,399
Oh, that's fucking fun.

4222
04:11:58,399 --> 04:12:02,639
So we had a few more bits that came through.

4223
04:12:02,639 --> 04:12:03,360
Thank you everybody.

4224
04:12:03,360 --> 04:12:06,030
All the subs, all the gifted subs,

4225
04:12:06,030 --> 04:12:07,870
all the resubs, everybody.

4226
04:12:12,239 --> 04:12:14,559
Might see a redesign of this as well,

4227
04:12:15,500 --> 04:12:16,299
if it's possible.

4228
04:12:16,299 --> 04:12:18,139
I might have this be changed

4229
04:12:18,940 --> 04:12:24,780
on top of all the other things

4230
04:12:25,729 --> 04:12:28,930
that Ballordow is in the current process

4231
04:12:28,930 --> 04:12:29,729
of making right now.

4232
04:12:36,450 --> 04:12:38,049
And we got a couple more bits here.

4233
04:12:38,049 --> 04:12:43,250
We had a brain just froze.

4234
04:12:43,250 --> 04:12:46,290
I'd ever agree for the five dolls.

4235
04:12:46,290 --> 04:12:48,899
Do you have any tips for streaming?

4236
04:12:48,899 --> 04:12:49,940
You're hilarious, dude.

4237
04:12:51,329 --> 04:12:52,850
Tips for streaming would be

4238
04:12:52,850 --> 04:12:54,049
make sure you're doing it for fun.

4239
04:12:54,610 --> 04:12:55,409
Make sure you're doing it

4240
04:12:56,209 --> 04:12:57,329
because you want to do it.

4241
04:12:57,329 --> 04:12:59,170
Make sure you're doing it not for money,

4242
04:12:59,170 --> 04:13:00,690
not for power, not for fame,

4243
04:13:01,250 --> 04:13:02,690
but because you want to.

4244
04:13:03,409 --> 04:13:04,209
It's very important.

4245
04:13:08,829 --> 04:13:10,590
And do something that you're comfortable doing.

4246
04:13:12,000 --> 04:13:13,840
Find your zone.

4247
04:13:13,840 --> 04:13:15,120
Find your spot that you know

4248
04:13:15,120 --> 04:13:15,920
that you'd like to do

4249
04:13:16,639 --> 04:13:17,360
and see what happens.

4250
04:13:20,690 --> 04:13:22,370
Power, power.

4251
04:13:28,000 --> 04:13:29,040
All you can do is see what happens

4252
04:13:31,889 --> 04:13:32,610
and just make sure you're

4253
04:13:32,610 --> 04:13:33,889
realistic with your goals.

4254
04:13:33,889 --> 04:13:35,170
Make sure you're realistic with yourself

4255
04:13:39,139 --> 04:13:40,500
and do your best

4256
04:13:41,219 --> 04:13:48,829
because at this point

4257
04:13:48,829 --> 04:13:50,270
there's a lot of people that stream now

4258
04:13:50,909 --> 04:13:54,989
and trying to kind of

4259
04:13:54,989 --> 04:13:56,350
poke your head above the crowd

4260
04:13:56,350 --> 04:13:57,229
can be very difficult.

4261
04:13:58,479 --> 04:14:00,319
So just stay true to yourself.

4262
04:14:00,319 --> 04:14:01,760
Do what you know that you like to do

4263
04:14:01,760 --> 04:14:02,639
and that you're good at doing

4264
04:14:04,030 --> 04:14:05,389
and try to have as much fun as you can

4265
04:14:06,930 --> 04:14:08,129
and see what happens.

4266
04:14:15,969 --> 04:14:17,010
Power hungry.

4267
04:14:18,989 --> 04:14:22,239
You must accept the power.

4268
04:14:22,879 --> 04:14:26,020
Trust Jermo.

4269
04:14:26,020 --> 04:14:27,459
No, then you wrote he's short.

4270
04:14:31,420 --> 04:14:33,500
And there are plenty of cases of people

4271
04:14:33,500 --> 04:14:34,459
that start streaming

4272
04:14:34,459 --> 04:14:35,579
and then they just they grow

4273
04:14:35,579 --> 04:14:36,459
and they grow and they grow.

4274
04:14:38,379 --> 04:14:40,620
It's not like, oh, it's impossible now.

4275
04:14:40,620 --> 04:14:43,680
There's a lot of cases.

4276
04:14:43,680 --> 04:14:45,360
There's always cases of people

4277
04:14:46,079 --> 04:14:47,620
grabbing some audience.

4278
04:14:48,260 --> 04:14:56,799
But I've had kind of moments like this

4279
04:14:56,799 --> 04:14:57,760
where I've talked about before

4280
04:14:58,559 --> 04:15:00,610
but it's hard to give advice

4281
04:15:00,610 --> 04:15:02,530
because I know what I do

4282
04:15:03,409 --> 04:15:05,010
and I know the way that I like to stream

4283
04:15:05,010 --> 04:15:07,889
and the way the things that I like to try.

4284
04:15:08,530 --> 04:15:09,649
It's hard to give advice to people

4285
04:15:09,649 --> 04:15:10,930
that might not be the same.

4286
04:15:10,930 --> 04:15:13,090
We might not have the same ideas.

4287
04:15:13,090 --> 04:15:14,850
We might have the same things

4288
04:15:14,850 --> 04:15:16,290
we're trying to do on stream.

4289
04:15:18,829 --> 04:15:20,190
There's not a whole lot of real good

4290
04:15:20,190 --> 04:15:21,629
like just advice

4291
04:15:21,629 --> 04:15:22,829
like blanket statement advice

4292
04:15:22,829 --> 04:15:24,190
on how to be a streamer.

4293
04:15:24,750 --> 04:15:26,670
You kind of have to make that on your own.

4294
04:15:26,670 --> 04:15:28,110
You have to figure out what that's going to be.

4295
04:15:35,250 --> 04:15:38,530
Kim is sitting in the hail at soccer practice

4296
04:15:38,530 --> 04:15:39,569
waiting to be picked up.

4297
04:15:45,549 --> 04:15:46,510
No, she's not.

4298
04:15:51,790 --> 04:15:56,260
But I wish you the best of luck.

4299
04:15:57,790 --> 04:15:58,590
Do it and have fun.

4300
04:16:04,850 --> 04:16:05,889
Is it still hailing?

4301
04:16:05,889 --> 04:16:06,930
No, that was really weird.

4302
04:16:06,930 --> 04:16:07,729
It was just hitting them.

4303
04:16:08,290 --> 04:16:09,889
Smashing into the windows and stuff.

4304
04:16:09,889 --> 04:16:10,450
It was crazy.

4305
04:16:14,180 --> 04:16:15,540
Dr. Clay at the very end here.

4306
04:16:15,540 --> 04:16:16,500
Thank you for the 250.

4307
04:16:17,920 --> 04:16:18,639
Even though the stream

4308
04:16:18,639 --> 04:16:19,840
was the result of bad internet

4309
04:16:19,840 --> 04:16:21,920
I just want to say that it was fun watching this.

4310
04:16:21,920 --> 04:16:23,200
I always enjoyed hearing the comments

4311
04:16:23,200 --> 04:16:25,120
from the perspective of the creator.

4312
04:16:25,120 --> 04:16:26,799
Nonetheless, hope everything is fixed

4313
04:16:26,799 --> 04:16:28,559
and you can go back to streaming without issues.

4314
04:16:28,559 --> 04:16:29,040
Take care.

4315
04:16:31,059 --> 04:16:31,540
Me too.

4316
04:16:32,260 --> 04:16:32,579
Me too.

4317
04:16:33,299 --> 04:16:35,059
I hope it's completely gone

4318
04:16:35,059 --> 04:16:36,180
as of the next day or two.

4319
04:16:40,129 --> 04:16:42,930
Yeah, I had a lot of fun on the stream.

4320
04:16:42,930 --> 04:16:44,450
I'm surprised that we were able to go

4321
04:16:44,450 --> 04:16:45,250
like five hours.

4322
04:16:46,659 --> 04:16:47,860
Kind of just melted.

4323
04:16:47,860 --> 04:16:49,459
The time just sort of disappeared

4324
04:16:49,459 --> 04:16:50,340
for a little while there.

4325
04:16:50,979 --> 04:16:57,549
Do I like sand?

4326
04:16:57,549 --> 04:17:00,059
Yeah, sand is cool.

4327
04:17:05,100 --> 04:17:07,180
And then finally right at the end we had Spooge.

4328
04:17:09,360 --> 04:17:10,799
Thanks for the three bucks.

4329
04:17:11,600 --> 04:17:14,000
Nine months sub now, Jeremy.

4330
04:17:14,000 --> 04:17:14,959
The baby is due.

4331
04:17:15,600 --> 04:17:17,120
But in all seriousness I want to let you know

4332
04:17:17,120 --> 04:17:21,120
that I had gotten a 30 on my ACT the first try

4333
04:17:21,120 --> 04:17:23,040
and I almost broke down about it.

4334
04:17:23,040 --> 04:17:25,680
I'm super excited and I appreciate you for being here

4335
04:17:25,680 --> 04:17:26,959
for all of us who have been stressing

4336
04:17:26,959 --> 04:17:27,920
about finals in school.

4337
04:17:28,719 --> 04:17:29,600
Love you, man.

4338
04:17:29,600 --> 04:17:31,280
I'll always be here and love every stream.

4339
04:17:33,819 --> 04:17:34,379
First try.

4340
04:17:35,569 --> 04:17:36,770
First try.

4341
04:17:36,770 --> 04:17:39,700
Holy shit.

4342
04:17:40,260 --> 04:17:45,440
Congratulations.

4343
04:17:45,920 --> 04:17:51,139
I, thanks for the nine months in a row.

4344
04:17:51,139 --> 04:17:52,260
30 out of 36.

4345
04:17:52,260 --> 04:17:53,299
That's pretty damn good.

4346
04:17:53,860 --> 04:17:58,159
That's pretty damn good.

4347
04:18:02,370 --> 04:18:04,129
30 out of 1600.

4348
04:18:04,129 --> 04:18:05,809
Oh, that would not be good.

4349
04:18:06,450 --> 04:18:16,209
Who doesn't like sand?

4350
04:18:16,209 --> 04:18:16,690
I don't know.

4351
04:18:16,690 --> 04:18:17,569
I don't know.

4352
04:18:17,569 --> 04:18:21,040
But yeah, congratulations on that.

4353
04:18:22,879 --> 04:18:23,600
That you should be pretty,

4354
04:18:23,600 --> 04:18:24,479
you should be very proud of that.

4355
04:18:24,479 --> 04:18:28,590
So thank you everybody.

4356
04:18:28,590 --> 04:18:29,229
That's my time.

4357
04:18:31,899 --> 04:18:33,340
We just, just over five hours.

4358
04:18:33,340 --> 04:18:33,819
Okay.

4359
04:18:33,819 --> 04:18:35,020
That's our, that's good then.

4360
04:18:35,020 --> 04:18:35,739
I'm okay then.

4361
04:18:35,739 --> 04:18:36,700
I'm all right with this stream.

4362
04:18:37,260 --> 04:18:38,219
I'm all right with it, I guess.

4363
04:18:38,219 --> 04:18:38,620
I'm okay.

4364
04:18:39,260 --> 04:18:42,209
I was scared there for a minute

4365
04:18:42,209 --> 04:18:43,569
that we were only going to get to

4366
04:18:43,569 --> 04:18:45,170
be live for like an hour and 10 minutes

4367
04:18:45,170 --> 04:18:46,530
and I would have been really sad about it.

4368
04:18:47,090 --> 04:18:48,049
So I'm all right with that.

4369
04:18:51,059 --> 04:18:54,020
I will see you guys hopefully by Tuesday.

4370
04:18:55,309 --> 04:18:56,989
If that is not the case,

4371
04:18:56,989 --> 04:18:58,030
I will make sure to let you know.

4372
04:18:58,030 --> 04:18:59,469
Just keep an eye on the sus

4373
04:18:59,469 --> 04:19:01,629
as of Monday night, Tuesday morning.

4374
04:19:02,639 --> 04:19:03,600
I'll make a tweet.

4375
04:19:03,600 --> 04:19:04,719
We'll probably on Tuesday morning

4376
04:19:04,719 --> 04:19:06,079
you give an update on how things are going.

4377
04:19:13,860 --> 04:19:14,659
Take care everybody.

4378
04:19:15,219 --> 04:19:17,100
Have a fantastic rest of your night.

4379
04:19:18,260 --> 04:19:18,979
See you very soon.

4380
04:19:20,219 --> 04:19:21,579
Ta ta for now.

4381
04:19:39,979 --> 04:19:41,979
I believe it is currently too early for legends

4382
04:19:41,979 --> 04:19:44,639
because I streamed less.

4383
04:19:44,639 --> 04:19:45,920
Yeah, I streamed yesterday.

4384
04:19:45,920 --> 04:19:48,159
So I did that late at night.

4385
04:19:48,159 --> 04:19:49,840
So no stream legends unfortunately.

4386
04:19:49,840 --> 04:19:50,399
Sorry guys.

4387
04:19:52,770 --> 04:19:53,969
See you real soon.

4388
04:19:53,969 --> 04:19:55,260
Have a great night.
