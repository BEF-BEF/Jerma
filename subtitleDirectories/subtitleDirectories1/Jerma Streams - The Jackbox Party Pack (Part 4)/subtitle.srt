1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:20,649
So, Jackbox. If you've taken off, I'll see you this weekend. Thanks for participating.

2
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:28,379
Let me open up Jackbox. This is gonna be loud as shit, isn't it? Let me turn it off. Party Pack 3,

3
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:57,270
by the way. Hey, there it is. Jackbox 3. Is it gonna capture it? Come on, man. Oh, that doesn't look

4
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:18,780
right. Why is it so small? Hold on. Why is this so small? Full screen mode. There it is. There we go.

5
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:27,900
All right. Volume control. That's fine. Full screen is on. All right. So, what are we gonna do?

6
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:38,069
Faking it? Quick Blast 2? TKO? I am. Remember to join the room first. I will. But first, I need to,

7
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:53,450
I need to put a title here. Jackbox wind down. Get off of just chatting. We'll do, yeah, we'll

8
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:12,439
do TKO. Turn it up. T-K-O. Anybody can play. We're gonna do turn off full screens. I need an, I need

9
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,159
another window open. Uh, we already know this. Please draw three times instead of four. And

10
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,460
writing time is shorter. Yeah, we want that. Audience on. Audience suggestions. While players

11
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,939
draw and write, audience can enter suggestions which appear on the screen. Meh. No extended timers.

12
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:46,310
Require Twitch. Yes. Manual censoring. On. Allow room code hiding. On. Okay. Here we go. I'm not

13
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,240
gonna do anything. I mean, there's no rhyme or reason to this one. There's gonna be, I'm gonna dump

14
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,020
it into the chat. Because we're only gonna be able to play one or two of these anyways. Change game?

15
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:04,580
I did. Refresh. Refresh. Refresh. This is taking a while. Please check your internet connection.

16
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:20,379
What's going on? Is Jackbox down too? How, how could Jackbox be down? I'm still live, right?

17
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:37,879
We're sorry. We can't seem to connect to the Jackbox games server. What? I'm still, I haven't

18
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,879
dropped any frames or anything. Okay. That's something fucking real weird is going on here.

19
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,659
All right. So I'm going to turn this off and then I'm going to put it in the chat. I'm going to join

20
00:03:49,659 --> 00:04:11,620
it first. Or code. I think I'm just going to say it. I'm just going to say it because then

21
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:27,670
there's no advantage. Something with me connecting to like websites is fucked. What the hell is going

22
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:39,500
on here? This is really fucking strange. Okay. Try it again. All right. Well, that was weird.

23
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:48,459
Okay. Are you ready? The letters are, I'm going to, I'm just going to say it out loud. Here we go.

24
00:04:54,009 --> 00:05:16,170
W E Y U. Hello. What do I want to be? The fire. Of course. All right. You can also join if you're

25
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,290
in the audience, extra players can join the audience. You're both who influenced the game.

26
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:29,050
You play on your device at jackbox.tv. You punch in this code and then you play. Here we go. You're

27
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:49,100
ready. One, two, three, fight. That was a nerve wracking. I'm just happy to get out of this house.

28
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:56,790
Welcome to TKO. I am the tournament master. I'm over 5,000 years old and I'm on my 200th

29
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:04,379
rewatch of the wire. Feast your eyes on beautiful t-shirt island. I call it that because it's kind

30
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:11,180
of shaped like a t-shirt and because of the t-shirt theme blouter that we hold here. So it works two

31
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:22,490
ways. Chapter one training grounds. Round one. After victory starts here at the training grounds.

32
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,649
You will use your device to draw two drawings. Okay. Feel free to draw anything that strikes

33
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:35,050
your fancy. And if your fancy isn't feeling so fancy, hit the suggestion button. It's time

34
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:42,170
for your first drawing. I'm ready. Right now. Okay. First drawing. Here we go. All right. How

35
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,209
much time do we have? No, not a whole lot of time. I got to just go. All right. Here we go. What do

36
00:06:47,209 --> 00:08:00,740
I want to do? This sucks. Okay. How much time? Only seconds remain.

37
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:18,730
Fuck. Did I wait? Do I have to click the button? Oh, stoop. You have to click the button.

38
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:33,460
I thought it like, no matter what, it just takes what you did. Well, I...

39
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:40,179
You have to submit or else nothing submits. It should just take what you did.

40
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:54,389
This is just practice? I don't think it is. This is the second time I've done this. This is probably

41
00:08:54,389 --> 00:09:10,730
like the 12th time I've done this. It's all right. I got my second drawing in. Did you just take

42
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:32,500
what you did? I have to put this in a different window. I'm putting it over here. Minimize this

43
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:47,720
window. All right. That's not the game's fault, no matter how bad you want it to be, but it still

44
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,549
should just do that. What about like the grandmothers that play this and they don't finish? Wait,

45
00:09:52,549 --> 00:10:05,269
where's my drawing? Last exercise, you will write as many slogans or phrases as you can.

46
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:09,830
These have nothing to do with your drawings, so just put those out of your mind.

47
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,590
And there's no shame in hitting the suggestion button if you need it.

48
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:43,049
You didn't give up after one, did you? Keep writing. There you go. I got it. ASMR typing.

49
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:11,960
I wrote like five. Enough training. Direct your attention to your device.

50
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,120
You have a series of drawings and slogans at your disposal.

51
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,080
Choose one of each to make the best t-shirt champion that you can. Okay. Don't phone it in.

52
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:46,840
Uh, why? All right, I'm gonna pick this one. Yeah, this is where fireman actually came from.

53
00:11:46,840 --> 00:12:05,419
This is it. Why are we here just to suffer? Versus... Look what you've done. I...

54
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:17,909
Using your devices to vote. I don't know. That's tough. Is that supposed to be Sam and Max over

55
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:39,480
there? That's... that's like scarecrow and Max. This one is taken on. Germacraft remastered.

56
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:52,409
I mean, it's... where's the Minecraft in there? There's no Minecraft in that t-shirt. It's just

57
00:12:53,129 --> 00:13:14,759
sun and clouds in the sky and grass. What? All right, Germacraft versus... I can't believe

58
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:37,740
you've done this. Uh, that's just... I've seen that video before. All right, Germacraft cannot

59
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:56,009
win because it has the word germa in it. I did vote for it. What? What is... what is going on here?

60
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:12,860
Uh, half the t-shirt? Germacraft related? Which do I pick?

61
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,730
He thinks he's gonna escape Germacraft.

62
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:43,340
What? All right, okay. That's... I... that's just like a run-on sentence.

63
00:14:46,070 --> 00:15:04,500
I... I didn't know... I didn't know what to do. Run over bitch with 2006 Toyota Highlander. I... what?

64
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:27,110
Versus? It's just a shame. Just a damn shame. Read it in the yoda voice. Run over with 2006 Toyota Highlander.

65
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:40,649
All right, whatever. Oh no, it's sizzled over here. That means this one wins. I win. Versus?

66
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,169
Hey, does anyone know where the bathroom is? I'm lactose intolerant and...

67
00:15:51,129 --> 00:16:13,899
and the world's on fire. He's just looking around. I don't know where the bathroom is.

68
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:28,139
The world's on fire. These are the winners? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. All right,

69
00:16:28,139 --> 00:17:56,680
this time I'm not gonna fuck around. I'm not gonna fuck it up this time. Don't worry. Uh, I get...

70
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:08,200
Got it. Got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

71
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:57,289
Don't worry. How about um... Wow! Oh, I got a two!

72
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:29,480
This sucks. I'm bad at drawing. So am I. I can't do it for shit.

73
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:38,200
So I take so long because I just second-guess everything I do.

74
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:57,589
Worma. Can I get that in blue? Yeah. No. Can I? Worma. Can I get that in blue? Versus? Yeah.

75
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:28,619
This is one of the emoji faces. Versus? Versus? I don't like either one of these. What is this?

76
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:43,160
Does the audience decide? I think they influence if there's a tie. I don't even know what this is!

77
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:44,099
Homina homina homina. Versus reality could be whatever I want. Oh yeah! Yeah, I know what you did.

78
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:58,700
No, you don't. You don't know shit. What? No, you guys found out that was the one that I made,

79
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:37,900
so then all of a sudden you want to get rid of it. Oh, that's a big, big F coming through. Yeah,

80
00:22:37,900 --> 00:23:11,960
I know what you did. I know what you did is gonna win versus... I drew that! He's lag switching.

81
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:26,470
I drew that one. A long tie and I drew that one. Yeah, it always starts at like four o'clock.

82
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:47,220
God hates compact streamers. What the fuck are you talking about? If you press pause and unpause,

83
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:56,140
it should catch up. Yeah, I actually did. I sent a message to Cox today saying,

84
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:02,740
God damn it. It's happening again. Fix the fucking internet and see if they get back to me today.

85
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:10,549
Which is here. Chapter five. From the previous rounds were made, the tournament ends here.

86
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:47,339
Why would that be the... Better not. I mean, this... I don't know if I would wear this shirt.

87
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:59,660
I don't think I would put this on. Yeah, I know. Versus... This is like the

88
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:27,000
kitty. Funny like cat face. Oh, this is tough. I had to... Does anyone know where the bathroom is?

89
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:42,440
What's the next one? I don't... I don't even want that one available for a shirt. I don't want

90
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:53,529
anyone to be able to buy that and wear it. Because they'll like... They'll wear it to like a convention

91
00:25:53,529 --> 00:26:10,069
and point at it and be like, hey! Hey dickhead! Yeah! Yeah, I know what you did. The cat won.

92
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:24,569
Oh man, we really might like... We might truly go down down. Thankfully, this is kind of just

93
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,819
the end of the stream. Like last hour of the stream anyways. This is bad.

94
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:41,430
All right, let's uh... Should we do another one of these? Or should we do one of the other games?

95
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,200
Another. Another. Yeah, we'll do another one. The other ones go faster anyways.

96
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:24,299
So we'll go do a new game. Exit. Thank you for playing. This one. Do we do a quick flash? Quick

97
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:33,019
flash is good to kind of just... We wanted another TKO. Yeah, but take... It takes... I'd rather try to

98
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:41,670
get some... We can do it again. I'd rather do one of these that can take less than get more people

99
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:49,349
to play. And then we can do another TKO. Let's change it up. Because if I... The stream might

100
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:55,380
actually just turn off. So I want to at least get this one too. Because this has been very very bad

101
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:03,849
the last couple of minutes. We'll find out. All right, so make sure the settings are correct.

102
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:12,710
That's fine. Extended time's off. Require twitch. Manual censoring. Yep, yep, yep. Room code.

103
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:29,750
So I'm just going to type it. And it's going to be in the screen on your twitch chat very shortly.

104
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:37,500
Say it. Well, when I say it, I have to type it. Because everybody will see it at the same time.

105
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:49,289
Because if I say it, people that are on like source will hear it first. So usually I would

106
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:51,849
do this in like a discord or something. But we're only going to do this for like another

107
00:28:51,849 --> 00:29:01,799
20-30 minutes or so. What do you mean the same thing? All right, if somebody opens the stream

108
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:10,519
and they're not on source versus people that are here, you know, if it... No one's seeing this at

109
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:18,890
the same exact time. It's like three or four seconds between people. If I put it in chat,

110
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:28,759
you might be like watching this stream like a second or two behind. All right, here we go.

111
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:41,019
I'm just going to put it in. Do the first three letters? All right, all right, fine. No, just...

112
00:29:41,019 --> 00:30:04,539
There it is. I also typed in G.

113
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,700
Oh, here's the code for reporting. That one.

114
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,740
Unfair to me because I don't know how to read. Fuck!

115
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:32,470
God damn it. I was so busy. Like, I'm just going to put the code in the chat.

116
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:41,799
And like we dropped to zero and the stream just like turned off.

117
00:30:45,460 --> 00:31:03,049
I hate this internet so much. It's so distracting. It just... I literally just saw it. It's going to

118
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:18,230
zero again. Like right now. Fuckers. Cocks motherfuckers. I'm sorry. I got distracted.

119
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:36,150
I thought he quit because he took the I can't read comment. No, I just... I didn't go into the

120
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:42,490
room because I went to zero and I just ran out of... I was an idiot. This is so frustrating.

121
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:48,950
Seriously is. Four hundred dollars a month for this internet. You fucking believe that shit?

122
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:55,910
Four hundred fucking dollars a month. Four hundred dollars a month. Oh, it's unfucking

123
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,009
believable. I wish I could like sue these motherfuckers, but you just can't.

124
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:23,140
It's a scam. Yeah, it's called pay for extraordinarily overpriced business internet

125
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,119
for them to give you dogshit service like two weeks out of the month. It's like that everywhere.

126
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:35,559
Fucking everywhere. You can move to like three cities in the United States to get like fiber

127
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:43,240
reliably. A bunch of dogshit. That's so fucking annoying. I'm... Oh, he's actually... Oh, I'm

128
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:53,859
actually mad. Actually mad. You're hearing like real actual mad. Can we do this shit all the

129
00:32:53,859 --> 00:33:03,819
fucking time? It doesn't matter what city you go to. It's everywhere. I was talking to people

130
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:08,059
before. I was talking to a couple of streamers that are like, hey, my internet's so bad. Should

131
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:13,859
I like... Where should I move? It's like... It doesn't matter. You could go anywhere. It's like

132
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,299
this in California. It's like this in fucking Nevada. It's like this in Boston. It doesn't

133
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:22,819
matter where you go. You can go to like Austin and get Google fiber. All right. Well, everyone's

134
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:38,380
gonna move to Austin. I'm not gonna move to EU. Pain in the dick. All right. Here we go. I'm gonna

135
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,690
punch it in. We'll do the first three letters this time. I'm sorry, guys. I'm just distracted

136
00:33:43,690 --> 00:34:11,260
by this bullshit. Here we go. Here comes the first three letters. There's another letter.

137
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:39,030
Internet. I think everybody's in. Here is now the code for you to see. It's just,

138
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,429
it's so normal to have shitty internet in North America. And it's incredibly expensive.

139
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:01,159
Fuck me. Pain in the ass. How did they guess? It's only one in a 26 chance.

140
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:14,900
So those are the names you're going with, huh? Okay, if you're sure. This is round one. You'll

141
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,099
score points based on the percentage of over 30. I'm so upset I got him the first time. I'm really

142
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:27,190
sorry. It's my fault. I'm sorry about that. I really am. All right. Here we go. Attention,

143
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,150
audience. While you wait for these annoyingly slow players, why not try the audience play along?

144
00:35:33,190 --> 00:36:10,099
Okay. That's it. Oh, shit. I forgot about the audience. I forgot. You can write anything.

145
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,070
It's just chat. Wait, I thought that people could just write anything they wanted and they could do

146
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:40,179
like the most. I think, yeah, I think you can. Yeah, you can. Almost out of time. Use the safety

147
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:46,760
clip button if you have to. Fucking internet. Internet. Internet. Internet. I'm gonna make my

148
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:56,699
own damn internet. Let's start this show. Number one on the list. A bad name for a proctologist.

149
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:21,539
Bad name for a proctologist. Dr. Dr. Yucky Gross. Dr. Yucky. Oh, Dr. Ass. Dr. Yucky Gross.

150
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:34,710
Wait, not like Dr. Dr. Schweikson. Why is Dr. Schweikson? Should be there. Next,

151
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,369
nursery rhyme that's guaranteed to give your kid nightmares.

152
00:37:39,369 --> 00:38:03,670
I don't know. I mean, that one's pretty horrifying.

153
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:13,559
I don't know why you give a child that. They would probably be very, very upset.

154
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:29,829
The name of a bra for dogs. Bra or D-pup.

155
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:50,090
That was when I was mid-meltdown. All right. Give me some credit here. I was very upset

156
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:55,289
about the internet. I just had to write something like a bra. A dog bra. I don't know.

157
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,179
Tiny high bee in living. Honey, I shrunk the furniture.

158
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:32,409
Right. Pretty clever. Pretty clever. Get the laugh track.

159
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:16,219
Dude, I was in the middle of being angry. These two weren't. This is not my prime here.

160
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,360
Better internet. Canada doesn't even have better internet.

161
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,199
Canada has, I think, worse internet than the United States.

162
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:02,659
Says he was caught. I know, right? A good restaurant to give a restaurant a zero star review.

163
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:12,199
They served auto or no garlic bread. You mean like they served auto food. They served dogs in

164
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,000
the restaurant and somebody saw that and thought it was disgusting. They're like, why would they

165
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:31,030
be dogs at the table? I would give a place zero stars if they didn't have garlic bread. That's

166
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,840
fucked up. Next is who buys a jet ski? It's a personal card that says this.

167
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:47,219
Anybody that buys a jet ski has a personal card that says this. Wave high or certified

168
00:41:47,219 --> 00:42:02,119
gamer license. What would you have a gamer license for? I mean, you don't need a gamer

169
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:15,179
license to ride a jet ski. It's not a game. Round one is in the books. Let's see this.

170
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:29,659
Everything can be a game. That's true. There's a chat meme. I know. I'm ready for this one.

171
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:41,780
Here we go. Audience members instead of just waiting around while the players

172
00:42:41,780 --> 00:43:29,340
type try the audience play along. Okay. Fuck. I'm here. I'm here. I put the funny epic edgy joke.

173
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:38,329
No fun allowed. Yeah, this is not an open world stream. This is a closed world stream.

174
00:43:52,099 --> 00:44:01,050
Choices don't matter. No choices. Yeah. Your choices. All right. Here we go. I'm going to get

175
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:12,360
monumental points here. Yeah. Force stealth would be me putting on slow mode.

176
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:23,349
Sub only mode. Why is old saying your grandma taught you look before you leap? Look before

177
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:30,699
you buy lottery tickets in Nevada. This is that's the just what this that's just a saying.

178
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,940
That's a call back to me not understanding that I couldn't purchase lottery tickets

179
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:42,139
in Nevada because there's no state lottery. So like actually physically look and physically find out

180
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:46,860
if I can actually do that before doing it. So that's pretty good. That's pretty good one.

181
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:01,320
I think that wins the game. Next one. Buying a new home. Always make sure the previous owner

182
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:07,719
didn't blank. Thank you for explaining the jokes. Well, there may not have been people here

183
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:15,219
on that stream. So, you know, you have to tell something. Make sure the previous owner didn't

184
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:32,650
move away to Las Vegas. Leave wasps in here. I don't understand this. Well, let me tell you.

185
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:42,789
So I moved. The sequel to Shakespeare in love would be called Shakespeare in blank.

186
00:45:46,519 --> 00:46:10,309
Which one is it? Which one is it going to be? I got the audience. I got the audience on that.

187
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:23,219
Next up. The dark secret of Frosty the snowman is that he blanks. What is the dark secret of

188
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:32,420
Frosty? He has bones on the inside. Isn't made of snow. What is that supposed to mean?

189
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:41,059
What do you mean not made of snow? What else would you be made out of?

190
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:59,380
Cocaine. You wouldn't you wouldn't be able to clump them together. It would be awesome if you

191
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:06,869
could grow blank in a garden. Get to voting. It would be awesome if you could grow cool person

192
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:19,420
in a garden or garlic bread in a garden. I mean, either one of those would be pretty

193
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:38,619
would be pretty pretty awesome, I guess. Cool person. Next in the hopper. A job that doesn't

194
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:42,940
exist but surely would have the highest death rate if it did. Oh, this could be a lot of

195
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:57,940
Ready, set, vote. This already this is a thing. What are you talking a tuber

196
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:10,940
would have the highest death rate. I could I could take care of myself just fine.

197
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:20,860
Okay, next one. Thank you very much. Something to stuff a bra with if you're in a hurry.

198
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:39,820
Put in your votes. If you're in a hurry. More bras. Watermelons.

199
00:48:39,820 --> 00:49:05,900
Yeah. Come on. You're better than that. No, I'm not. It's voting time. What a turtle looks

200
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:14,460
for in a mate. Oh, we're getting political. It just got political. It just got political.

201
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:35,590
How quickly could you stuff a watermelon in a bra? I don't know. Depends on how big it was.

202
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,510
Who is no more? Let's see the damage.

203
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:50,360
Aren't you supposed to be the funny guy? I use my funny powers when I deem it necessary.

204
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,940
Welcome to the last lash. The final round. There's just one prompt and you're all getting it.

205
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:07,539
Make up the full name for this acronym. Full name for this acronym.

206
00:50:47,860 --> 00:51:08,440
I don't know. I don't know. Oh, that doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense.

207
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,840
Mine makes no sense. I don't even know. It might win.

208
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:38,630
You got that one. There's an O in this season. There's an O in that one.

209
00:51:47,219 --> 00:52:07,289
Great. Let's see where those medals ended up. First, the bronze, silver, and now the gold.

210
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,050
Now we transform those medals into points.

211
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:22,940
Jerma, what the fuck? I was trying to go for the click. I was trying to go for the clicks.

212
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,389
It's over. Let's see the final scores.

213
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:41,460
All right, fourth place. I still get to go on to the next Mario Kart track.

214
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:58,260
I'm going to keep being Koopa Troopa. Still lost? Well, I mean, but what if I'm in first

215
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,579
place next time and I get more points than Mario does and I end up getting the trophy

216
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:11,590
after three or four more. All right, let's do you lost to three people who are good at guessing

217
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:19,559
letters. That means that they're like they have swiftness. All right, so we're going to do the

218
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:26,650
t-shirt one again and then I got to get out of here because I have to get ready and I have to

219
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:32,969
go pick up somebody at the airport. So I got to get out of here. Let's do the t-shirt one again.

220
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:55,380
Thank you for playing, guys. Wait, what are you doing? I want to exit. All right, I'm going to

221
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:04,969
do a good one this time. Just you wait. So this one, we will exclusitize this one. I'm going to

222
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:10,969
put this, I'll give you some time. Don't worry. I'm going to put this in the sub discord channel.

223
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:27,539
Okay, I'm going to do three letters again in the sub discord channel. I'll give you time to pay to

224
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:40,920
win. Well, it was one out of three pay to win. Two out of three for free. All right, let me just get

225
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:53,719
it started. Let's get this off the screen and I'm going to put it in that discord. I'm going to have

226
00:54:53,719 --> 00:55:04,489
the first letter missing. Okay, the first letter is going to be missing in the discord. I'll give

227
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:17,510
you an opportunity to get in there if you want to, if you're available. I am now in. Okay, ready?

228
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:24,380
First letter is going to be missing. Or, no, yeah, the first, that's actually kind of, yeah,

229
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:40,519
that's better. First letter will be missing. Okay, here we go. This is the last three letters.

230
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:58,059
Remember, last three letters. I will give you a dash just so you remember. Somebody got it.

231
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:16,360
Somebody else got it. There's still plenty of room here. One more slot. Oh, somebody got it.

232
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:32,550
There it is. It was O-P-K-H. All right, I'm going to draw something very good this time.

233
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:54,179
We ready? Three, two, one, let's start. Oh, well, there's your countdown. How about you give us the

234
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:59,849
code and you have to guess the first letter. I'm not sure that would be a thing that would work.

235
00:57:04,409 --> 00:57:28,650
Can we skip this? All right, I know exactly what I'm doing.

236
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,820
I don't think we can skip the intro.

237
00:57:50,309 --> 00:59:08,179
How do I undo? 40 seconds. I'm done.

238
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:16,380
This game is so cute, it is very cute. It's a very nice little game.

239
00:59:16,380 --> 01:00:38,570
Remember to hit submit. That's true. Second drawing. All right, that's done. Done. I don't

240
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:55,079
need to do it anymore. Let's go. Oh, JervaCraft. What if we all just did JervaCraft? Every single

241
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:03,690
one. I'm glad I said that after this was done so then people wouldn't have the opportunity to do

242
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:14,440
it. Mine is so bad. So is mine. Don't worry, they're all going to be bad.

243
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:24,340
Here we go.

244
01:01:24,340 --> 01:02:02,570
You didn't give up after one, did you? Keep writing. You may want to finish up.

245
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:13,820
Fuck, I almost said four. Nice hustle. Zero. One.

246
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:25,019
Training is over. Look at your device. Select one drawing and slow it to create the perfect

247
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:40,440
t-shirt combination. And I do mean perfect. Oh my god. I'm so disappointed. I'm disappointed.

248
01:02:54,039 --> 01:03:03,030
Sorry, dad. It's okay. You can turn off training in the settings. Oh shit, okay.

249
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:08,469
Well, I'm sorry about that. Thanks for the tip. I'm disappointed in you too.

250
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:17,719
It's okay. Let's go. Rat Movie 3 will never be released as an angry rainbow versus

251
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:55,429
Yeet Me Into the Grave. I don't know what this is. Oh boy, that one was burnt up. All right,

252
01:03:55,429 --> 01:04:00,760
Rat Movie Rainbow versus Scoff at Him. Mom, can you pick me up? I'm scared.

253
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:21,289
Scoff at Him. That's just Lightning Man. Oh man, Lightning Man coming in, I guess.

254
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:33,369
Fireman 2. That's just Fireman shaved and started going to the gym.

255
01:04:55,849 --> 01:05:05,159
Zapman or Riot. Doesn't look like it. Sorry, guys. I do like the little zap guy though.

256
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:28,119
A new challenger appears. Six Flags. Six Flags. Who is that? Oh, that's you.

257
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:43,000
That's you at Six Flags. Yes. All right, I get it. Oh, what? What? This is mine. I didn't even

258
01:05:43,000 --> 01:06:04,380
want it to win. Telling the truth. Mom, can you pick me up? This is... I'm conflicted here

259
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:18,329
because these are both mine. I drew the one on the right. I picked the text for this one

260
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:29,030
and then I drew the one on the right. I believe in auto. What the fuck is that? What is that?

261
01:06:37,820 --> 01:07:30,920
I believe in auto. All right, I believe in auto versus... No, I'm not giving you guys an opportunity

262
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,780
for everyone to click sans. I'm sorry.

263
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:51,530
I wanted sans. No. No, we're not gonna have a sans...

264
01:09:15,260 --> 01:10:06,300
I want the funny skeleton character. Fuck, I almost got it.

265
01:10:17,369 --> 01:10:53,539
Make a shirt. What has he made? I love how you save one game and then you get sucked in.

266
01:10:53,539 --> 01:10:56,420
Well, it's fun. It's fun just to play these weird little things.

267
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:04,899
You're... What does this say? You're grounded. What is it? Apple? The great pet...

268
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:14,100
That's a sans though. That's a sans. What is it? The great pet... I don't know what this is.

269
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:35,579
You're grounded. What does this say? Okay. That's a sans. I'm just kidding.

270
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:45,340
You cracked me up, little buddy. What does that say? Can we zoom in on that?

271
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:59,000
Well, this is you guys. Does it say sans? I don't know what that says. Six flags. Why would you be

272
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:18,539
unhappy at six flags? He's calling me at the worst time. That's sans. That's a sans eye. Okay.

273
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:35,560
I'm sorry. I'm not good enough. Oh, the airport! Oh, my friend! No, don't worry. Late to the

274
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:41,020
imagine? That'd be so awful. Hey dude, where the fuck are you? I've been waiting in the terminal

275
01:12:41,020 --> 01:13:02,859
for like two hours. Oof. Looks like the circus is in time versus I'm sorry. I'm not good enough.

276
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:38,600
There goes the cat. Oh well. Burger versus channel meme. Which one?

277
01:13:39,000 --> 01:14:06,260
I'm not sure. This is actually going to be 50-50, I think. Burger it is. What? How? How's it

278
01:14:06,260 --> 01:15:11,060
possible? Oh, great. And it even has this on the bottom too. All right, I got a confession to make.

279
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:16,539
I drew the sans and I did the A A A A A A A. I was hoping somebody was going to get it and put them

280
01:15:16,539 --> 01:15:45,029
together. Center. I was trying to debate the win. Uh oh, this is tough. Oh, come on. Versus like

281
01:15:45,029 --> 01:15:59,670
the flexing guy at the gym. Sensors others then makes his own. Like sensors then steals and says

282
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:14,810
it's his original content. Come on. Well, 128 of you are smart. You know, you're smart. Oh,

283
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:40,060
and what's that? That's mine. I win. Burger versus Zapman. Sorry, I'm not good enough.

284
01:16:40,859 --> 01:16:47,029
Uh oh, what's the auto? Oh no, this is the new little guy. That's a very good burger though.

285
01:16:47,029 --> 01:17:00,550
That's a very steady hand. What's the last one? Oh, I forgot about I believe in auto.

286
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:27,289
He clashed the titans. Yeah. Uh oh, that's it. I believe in auto. That shirt sucks. Choose

287
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:36,060
Zapman. I believe in auto. I could see you all compete in this tournament before I died.

288
01:17:36,060 --> 01:18:25,260
Show auto. He doesn't want to look up. I have to like point this down. What's that auto? What's

289
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:40,250
this? Hello auto. What's going on over here? He's like, what are you doing? Look over there.

290
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:46,859
Look at him. He's like, I don't want to look over there. I don't want to look over there.

291
01:18:46,859 --> 01:19:00,010
He's too sleepy. He really is just like, no. He's so cute. Okay. Sleepy dog. Come here.

292
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:21,739
Over here dog. Shaggy and Scooby. Now show Cheeto. Oh right. Come here Cheeto. Look at

293
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:30,039
how long my nails are. Holy shit. What a psycho. I could like go do Wolverine trials with these

294
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:47,989
things. I'm gonna take care of that after the stream. All right. That is gonna be it. Click

295
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:56,859
here to share or buy these shirts if you really, really feel like doing that. I'm gonna post the

296
01:19:56,859 --> 01:20:02,140
link here. This is a link to all the shirts if anyone is going to purchase any of these.

297
01:20:03,609 --> 01:20:18,180
Here they are. They're pretty much all here from this past round. Yoda was a not, I didn't draw

298
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:26,920
that. That was a fake drawing because I didn't, I ran out of time. Did anyone have a link from

299
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:39,960
the last round in TKO? Because that one had Yoda on it. Thanks for playing guys. There's the,

300
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:46,659
okay there it is from the last one. Cool. All right everybody. I will see you guys on Saturday.

301
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:56,920
I'm gonna call it here. I have to get ready and then get to the airport. Do Jackbox some other

302
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:01,399
time. Yeah it pops up from time to time. This stream was fucking, my like throat hurts from

303
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:06,619
laughing at that robot in the beginning, the first like few hours. And it's always fun to play Jackbox

304
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:12,439
and chill and hang out and have a good time. So I will see you guys on Saturday. That's the next

305
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:23,399
time you will see this stream activated. Appreciate everybody for hanging out. And we only had like

306
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:28,439
one real like streamer meltdown about the internet. That's, that's the first. It's been well done. No.

307
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:37,079
No I'm not gonna let that ruin my good time. It was fucking a ton of fun. But yeah I'll see

308
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:45,770
you guys soon. We'll do the bits and the subs. Let's get them on the screen. Why not? I need,

309
01:21:45,770 --> 01:22:01,140
there it is. This chat too. Thank you everybody. Thank you to, especially to these people.

310
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:10,390
Go back a few hours ago here. We had a bunch of community subs too. Thank you to another maple.

311
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:21,670
Happy birthday another maple. Happy 19th birthday to another maple. Some guy, thanks for the five

312
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:26,250
dollars. Hey so how about that children's book deal? Don't worry I haven't forgotten about it.

313
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:53,880
Children's book deal? Daylight? What day? What day is today? Today? It is Wednesday my dudes.

314
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:06,680
I don't even know what that is. It's like everybody's a Scrooge yelling at Tiny Tim out

315
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:13,939
the window. Uh thank, thank you some guy for the five dollars. Uh thank you R Ken for the three

316
01:23:13,939 --> 01:23:17,779
bucks. Just wanted to let you know that I love you man. It's been tough to catch your streams

317
01:23:17,779 --> 01:23:22,359
as I'm currently on an exchange from Australia to Finland. Probably be asleep by the time you

318
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:29,449
read this so mind wave me some good dreams. Will do. Uh thank you so much for the three bucks and

319
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:44,039
Australia to Finland. That's pretty long ways away. Thank you so much for the three bucks

320
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:50,119
and you're on exchange from Australia to Finland. I wonder what, if you get this maybe give us an

321
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:59,289
update. What for? What are you doing? That sounds interesting. But thank you. Thank you the Jack for

322
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:04,569
the 280. The AI recognizes people as well so if you type in Todd Howard it will talk about Skyrim.

323
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:10,340
You can write in screen writing style so do your silly little voices. I might have to play with

324
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:22,550
that again. Should have typed Jerma. I typed Jerma a few times. It just gave us like weird responses.

325
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:31,130
It gave us like weird chat logs every time I would put my name in. Uh thank you Growlithe for the

326
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:34,890
five bucks. Been having a rough week and this stream is exactly what I needed. Been watching

327
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:41,270
you for years. Love everything you do. Keep being you. Thank you for the five bucks and for the

328
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:53,699
really really nice fucking thing to say. Thank you. Hope you have a better week. Happy to be

329
01:24:53,699 --> 01:25:02,550
able to hang out and you know at least have fun right? Tingy thanks for the 250 Tingy. Is this

330
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:07,029
where BF Bugleberry got his Halloween stories? No I wrote the entire Halloween story. The last

331
01:25:07,029 --> 01:25:13,029
one I wrote the whole thing. Bugleberry's like four page Halloween story about like

332
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:28,630
the loud man. I just I wrote the whole thing. It was dog shit but I still did it. Thank you though.

333
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:38,789
Amferik thanks for the 10 community subs. That was earlier a couple hours ago. We also had two

334
01:25:38,789 --> 01:25:46,340
$100 bit drops from Smotherum and Lexi. Thank you both of you for your huge amounts of money.

335
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:53,899
Uh I think I missed Reim. ReimTV gave five community subs an hour and a half ago or so.

336
01:25:54,539 --> 01:26:05,220
Thank you Reim for your sub drop here. Kalula Sniper thanks for the 250. Holy shit Jerma this

337
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:09,460
stream was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. That E3 bit absolutely slayed me. BRB you

338
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:15,479
need to wipe the tears from my eyes. Dude some of those six flags that the Six Flags one with

339
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:20,840
the Great Wall of China was seriously like I I wish like I said I wish I could like eat that image.

340
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:33,380
What like a fun thing. What a fun thing. Yeah there were some really fun ones.

341
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:48,600
Tales from the Tomb Raider. Thank you KRYSKris for the five dollars. Time to play GeoGuessr.

342
01:26:49,159 --> 01:26:57,380
No we're taking a GeoGuessr break but thank you with the five dollars. Thank you Jess you got it

343
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:01,859
for the 250. Here's my contribution to the lawyer fund so you can sue Cox. Oh yeah didn't I want I

344
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:09,399
did I say I was gonna sue Cox. I turned into like a fireball for like 45 seconds. I don't remember

345
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:19,800
what did I say. The volcano erupted inside of my body and I said that like I what did I say fuck

346
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:37,989
Cox I want to sue him. Jesus Christ. He said you wish you could sue them. Oh well those motherfuckers

347
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:53,340
I'm about to sue them. Oh I can't contain my rage. This is impossible. You kept repeating

348
01:27:53,340 --> 01:28:14,220
400 400 400 400 400. Oh god. You used motherfucker twice in a sentence. It was the most genuinely

349
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:25,109
angry I've ever heard you. That's so fucking ridiculous. Get a business line with him. I have

350
01:28:25,109 --> 01:28:36,869
that's what I have. I have a business line from Cox that is the business package. I already have

351
01:28:36,869 --> 01:28:49,899
it and it don't matter. Why business? Because if you have residential internet and you have a problem

352
01:28:50,619 --> 01:28:56,300
they send the residential technicians and they don't really care. They tell you to turn your

353
01:28:56,300 --> 01:29:02,779
modem off and on again when they have packet loss and noise ingress in their line going to the plant.

354
01:29:04,329 --> 01:29:09,420
So if you do if you do not have a business line from one of these internet companies

355
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:20,939
they do not fix your problem. And the thing about uptime guarantees is they for when I'm

356
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:26,220
streaming right so let's say I drop like 20 000 frames on a stream and like it fucks up every

357
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:32,170
10 minutes or so. That's still technically they can still spin it whereas well yeah but I mean

358
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:36,569
it's still 99% up. What about the times when you're not streaming and you're using the internet on the

359
01:29:36,569 --> 01:29:44,329
line? So technically in a 24 hour day these like 30 to 40 000 frames a drop it doesn't matter like

360
01:29:44,329 --> 01:29:59,989
that's still part of their like uptime. No they don't give a shit. They never will. The people

361
01:29:59,989 --> 01:30:04,630
that are on like the ground level do care. It's it's kind of funny because you'll talk to some

362
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:09,270
of these technicians that are like you know they come out and they try to service and they try to

363
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:15,140
figure out what's wrong. And there are people above those people who are above those people who are

364
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:23,539
above those people. So it doesn't matter. Somebody has to figure out what they want to do about it

365
01:30:23,539 --> 01:30:30,460
and it's not the person that comes to your house. That person cannot fix your problem.

366
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:38,699
They can tell someone else that it exists and then that person has to deem if it's necessary for them

367
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:47,109
to fix it and tell the next person to do so. So getting upset or angry at the technician that

368
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:51,750
comes out is is just wasted breath because that person cannot even fix your problem.

369
01:30:51,750 --> 01:31:01,449
All they can do is start the chain. It ends up being a game of telephone which is why

370
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:12,630
fortunately for for this particular location every time there's been a problem the thank you

371
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:18,100
every time there's been a problem like a real addressable problem where you know

372
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:25,239
20 30 40 000 drop frames per stream for a week this guy that I have contact with does fix it

373
01:31:25,239 --> 01:31:31,800
like he does do what he can and he does get them to do it but that process to get there took like

374
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:44,250
six months of getting that guy that you can talk to so you can get a business contact with cox it's

375
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:47,609
like having a representative of the company that knows you we used to offer those to our property

376
01:31:47,609 --> 01:31:55,270
managers yeah it's it's just hard it's hard because there's so many employees there's so

377
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:59,350
many customers that it just it's impossible to stay on top of it no matter where you are

378
01:31:59,909 --> 01:32:09,399
but it's all good like obviously i'm gonna fly off the handle sometimes when it

379
01:32:10,489 --> 01:32:17,770
ruins a stream right because when your stream goes to zero and you get a buffer and you have

380
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:25,189
to refresh the page that fucks up the stream that takes my mind and all of our collective

381
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:32,020
good time we're having into oh well hold on a minute hold on hold on give me give me like

382
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:38,380
two three minutes okay is it are we are we through it oh okay can you hear me you can hear me okay

383
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:47,380
good it's just an inconsistent fucking mess they know it breaks the immersion well just it just

384
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:53,239
it's just not fun when you're interrupted every two or three minutes you can't let when you get

385
01:32:53,239 --> 01:32:57,800
in a groove and then you look over and you see the red zero it's like well oh better quiet better

386
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:10,310
stop talking for 30 seconds and see what happens and it's almost like yeah you it's almost like

387
01:33:10,869 --> 01:33:14,390
i'm sure you guys have noticed when there's internet problems start happening let's say

388
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:23,100
they happen for like an hour or so right that hour is me trying to dance around frame drops

389
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:26,779
and it impedes on the stream it fucks with the stream because then whatever i was doing

390
01:33:26,779 --> 01:33:31,579
previously now i have to think in the back of my mind and glance over to the right here to my

391
01:33:31,579 --> 01:33:40,010
obesity when i drop down when can i stop talking should i just i'm dead here refresh you know it's

392
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:45,979
it's a pain in the ass rather than just focusing on what we're doing it just really it really

393
01:33:45,979 --> 01:33:56,260
really really just is annoying but like i said i'm not gonna let that ruin my good times i

394
01:33:56,260 --> 01:34:06,890
said my piece maybe i said it for about a minute or two we moved on and it's been up i'm not gonna

395
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:12,090
let it ruin the good time today was a ton of fucking fun i'm not gonna let that sour a really

396
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:35,960
really fun day so hope it didn't for you either let's keep going we were at where is it here

397
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:40,760
we were it was just you got it for the 250 here's my contribution to the lawyer fund that's what

398
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:51,800
started that creation come undone thanks for the 10 bucks hi german i'm the guy who originally

399
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,199
suggested talk to transformer during the day's gone stream hope you had fun sometimes all it

400
01:34:56,199 --> 01:35:06,949
takes is one guy that's true all it takes is one guy it was a great suggestion i had never even

401
01:35:06,949 --> 01:35:15,909
heard of it thank you for the 10 bucks tingy thanks for the 250 i'll have you know west coast

402
01:35:15,909 --> 01:35:20,710
canada has very good internet we have two isps who are in direct competition with each other

403
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:24,710
with both working on expanding their fiber infrastructure one of them now offering up to

404
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:39,289
a thousand down a thousand up for half the cost of your business internet yeah yeah but here's

405
01:35:39,289 --> 01:35:47,239
like the the worst part about this is if there's let's just let's say that there are like i said

406
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:54,359
like a handful of american cities that have reliable fiber or you know best internet in the

407
01:35:54,359 --> 01:36:02,520
country reliable everywhere it really doesn't matter because you could have like massachusetts

408
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:07,239
like boston has the best internet apparently like it's in the top 10 or something for internet in

409
01:36:07,239 --> 01:36:13,819
the country but i had problems all the fucking time it really doesn't matter how like fast or

410
01:36:13,819 --> 01:36:20,470
how good on paper internet is supposed to be it there's always pockets that are just terrible

411
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:27,029
and it's impossible to know where those pockets are you can't know that unless you go in and you

412
01:36:27,029 --> 01:36:34,340
use it for like a month or two straight it's about stability yeah it's not about how fast or good

413
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:46,420
the internet is supposed to be it's how stable it is while it's running and it's you'll you'll

414
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:51,560
it's just so hard to you know i've said it before and i've heard other people say it like well why

415
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:55,319
didn't you just figure out what the internet was and how good it was before you went there

416
01:36:56,359 --> 01:37:01,560
actually asked people actually asked realtors and shit like hey does the do you know how how's the

417
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:08,659
internet and over every single question is exactly answer the same way i just high speed you call up

418
01:37:08,659 --> 01:37:13,699
these companies and you say hey what do you have available here uh yeah we have high speed we have

419
01:37:13,699 --> 01:37:22,489
this package for high speed do you have fiber yeah oh okay do you though no no we have this

420
01:37:22,489 --> 01:37:29,800
this thing it's a thousand down but it's 30 up but it's not fiber no it's not but it is the fuck are

421
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:34,279
you talking about you know what i mean it's like impossible to like get straight answers for

422
01:37:34,279 --> 01:37:48,199
anything and here's the most the worst part about this is if we if i was to walk down the street

423
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:55,899
and plug in my computer and stream there might be zero dropped frames just because of where it's

424
01:37:55,899 --> 01:38:02,890
located on the node on the street you know what i'm saying it's impossible to find that exact

425
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:16,939
location that has zero problems okay can i can i come in and feed off your internet please

426
01:38:16,939 --> 01:38:33,180
just be a bum streamer no i i i just got really unlucky that i had kind of sloppy internet

427
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:42,329
in one place and then it's the same kind of sloppy internet in the next one i tried i tried to figure

428
01:38:42,329 --> 01:38:48,470
out what the best place the best like internet i could get it's just unfortunate and it's funny

429
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:56,020
because i talk like this and i look at like my twitter feed and i see a ton of people writing

430
01:38:56,020 --> 01:39:00,100
sorry guys i had to stop the stream because i can't even stream for more than an hour

431
01:39:00,739 --> 01:39:06,119
my internet turned off again you know it's like it's this is not uh it's not abnormal what i'm

432
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:22,729
saying which is kind of annoying it's pretty much every day i'll scroll down my twitter feed and

433
01:39:22,729 --> 01:39:31,130
other streamers that i follow at least one of them will say something like that nova is having the

434
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:45,829
same problem yep it just sometimes it just happens sometimes you just get fucked and that's it but i

435
01:39:45,829 --> 01:39:49,590
could go i could talk about this for ages we'll uh we'll move on i gotta get out here anyways
