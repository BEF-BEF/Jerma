1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:08,599
Hello, it's muted. Yeah, I was cleaning a few things up. Let's take a fair, fair few things.

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:24,949
How we doing? Welcome back to another stream. Tonight we're gonna do more Darkwood and hopefully

3
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:31,050
get somewhere close to the end. If we don't get close to the end then

4
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:38,219
gonna have to do it a different day. Gonna have to finish it at some point and when I come back

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,079
after the weekend here. But before we do any of that, before we talk about Darkwood

6
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:55,740
or even play Darkwood, we have something to talk about. What's wrong? I'm gonna wait till people

7
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:05,819
come in because I have a small announcement to make. Triplets! We're gonna have triplets!

8
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:24,170
Just kidding. So there is gonna be a Halloween stream this year and the Halloween stream is

9
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:34,359
going to be a fairly elaborate one. But hold on. I need to wait because there's a lot to this that

10
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:47,719
needs some explaining. Let me just wait till people trickle in. I'm excited. I'm excited

11
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:56,939
because this is gonna be a shitshow. Here comes the bugleberry takeover. Somebody actually

12
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:06,200
mentioned this yesterday and it was so hard to not say anything. Do you know how difficult it is? I

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,370
cannot get- don't ever tell me a secret, first of all. If you have a- hey man I gotta tell you-

14
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,169
I gotta tell you a secret. Oh, Jerry. Oh my god. He was like so annoying today. I'm gonna tell Jerry

15
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:25,530
immediately. Like within 10 minutes. We're gonna be like, bye! You're gonna be walking away and

16
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,569
Jerry's gonna walk by. Jerry! I got to tell you something, Jerry. Don't ever tell me a secret.

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,039
He's just a snitch. No, no, no. That's a really bad example. That's a terrible example. No,

18
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,599
if somebody told me like a secret, something in confidence, I would not tell anybody if they

19
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,879
didn't want me to. I'm just saying like I'm- it's hard for me to sit on information.

20
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,439
Jerry trusted you. No, it wasn't Jerry that trusted me. It was somebody else.

21
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:03,530
No, no, no. Let's put it- no, no, no. Hold on. Let me rephrase that.

22
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,599
If you told me, hey I want to- we're planning Jerry's surprise birthday party for next weekend.

23
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,699
Oh, this is gonna be three clowns. We're gonna have a tractor. There's gonna be like a fire engine's

24
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:21,580
gonna come and honk the horn. I'm gonna be like, holy shit, that's awesome. I'm gonna see Jerry the

25
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,099
next day and I'm gonna accidentally be like, what are we talking about anything? And I will slip up

26
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,460
and say, oh dude, like the- that's such a bright red. Oh, that's such a beautiful bright red. You're

27
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,349
right on that painting. Just like the fire truck that's gonna be there next weekend. That's what

28
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:46,340
it is. Yeah, I corrected it. It's better. So it's not- I'm not like a- I don't like- I'm not gonna

29
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,229
like somebody tell me something in confidence, but that would be in confidence too. But anyways,

30
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,030
so this stream is gonna be on maybe Halloween, maybe a day before,

31
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,949
maybe a couple days. It depends. We have to lock in the dates here, but we're going to do a secret

32
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:11,400
slime action stream. What is this? What are you guys- what are you guys linking me?

33
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:25,160
Robotic Sideshow. Jay Albertson's Robotic Sideshow? What? No. Is this in the game?

34
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:40,139
Wait, what? No, it's not. Holy shit. Okay, that's awesome. Really? Oh, that's awesome.

35
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:55,459
It's a new community map in the- oh wow. That's so cool. I am- I'm like flo- I don't even know

36
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:04,060
what to say. That's so cool. I thought there was like somebody just made a- like a Photoshop or

37
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,079
something, but that's- that's awesome. There's a Vinesauce- Vinesauce stuff in there too. That's

38
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:18,730
awesome. I'm gonna have to check that out. He's gonna cry. That's so cute. Yeah, I'll show it on

39
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:25,829
screen. That's really cool. But anyways, yeah, that's- I got all kinds of emotions going on

40
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:33,500
right now. There's like four different emotions. I'm excited, I'm happy, I'm like humbled, I'm

41
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,259
surprised. This is- I got all of it. The whole cast of Inside Out is in here right now,

42
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:45,000
and they're all talking at the same time. Except for the- no, the anger. I got- the anger is on

43
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,420
lunch, and fear is on lunch. So only like four- like three of them. I don't even know- I've never even

44
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,459
seen- I don't- I don't- I don't even know- I don't know what that plot of that movie is. I've never

45
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:59,420
seen it. I just know that there's like emotions that all hang out in somebody's body. I don't- I've

46
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:06,360
never seen it. But, uh, besides that, which is awesome, we are going to be doing on Halloween

47
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:15,879
a secret slime action stream. What does that mean? Well, it's taken about three or four days to

48
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:22,279
scramble to get this done, but I have to do it. Over the next few weeks, the next two weeks or so,

49
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,639
not now, but this weekend, probably- probably Sunday or into Monday, there's going to be a

50
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:35,060
couple new channels in the Discord. In those channels, what you are going to do is you are

51
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,759
going to come up with- one channel will be for discussion. So you can talk about it. What- what

52
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,560
should we do? What should we try to see? What he'll do? Discussing actions that I am going to be doing

53
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:55,240
on stream without my knowledge. Just like that, those old Nickelodeon shows. So, for instance,

54
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,879
I'll give you an example. Scratching your nose. That's going to be one of the actions, possibly.

55
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,199
And if I do the actions that you guys come up with during the course of probably 10 rounds,

56
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:17,529
I get slimed. With real slime. Sitting at a computer. Now, that's all fun and dandy,

57
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:25,430
but what about you? See, you also are going to have actions that you cannot say or do. And if

58
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,800
you do them, then you're gone during the course of that stream. So I get to come up with a two.

59
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,199
So each round, there will be maybe one or two actions that we both cannot do. There will be a

60
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:50,920
bot. There will be- it's time for slime, thanks to five community subs right on time. So your goal-

61
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,000
well, the goal here is, let's say, uh, I'm going to try to explain this piece by piece because it

62
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,720
takes a lot of explanation for it to understand even what the hell this is. I am going to start

63
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,230
with a certain amount of points and we're going to do it by rounds and each round is going to have

64
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:10,360
a timer on it. So after 15 minutes or so, that'll be the end of round one. And however many people

65
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:18,060
did the thing in chat that was the secret chat slime action, those people are out of the game.

66
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,060
I'm not going to make this easy for you. It's going to be very, very, very hard for you not to talk

67
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:32,649
about stuff. Just don't chat. That's fine. But we're going to have a program that is going to be

68
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:44,059
created to track who is participating in the games. You're not going to hit permaband. Why would you

69
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:52,600
permaband? This is going to be a lot of fun. And that's just part one. Uh, I think my computer

70
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:02,919
crashed. No, it's fine. Uh, there are going to be three separate activities that happen on this

71
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:09,500
stream. That's part one. There's a part two and a part three that I don't really want to talk to you

72
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:23,779
about because that would kind of spoil it, essentially. Not yet. BF Bugleberry, please.

73
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,460
I mean, that's the most hated character in the whole entire universe, this whole channel.

74
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,860
I don't, I don't, I don't think that Bugleberry will make an appearance. I mean, why would they?

75
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,179
But, uh, there's going to be more, I just want to really bring it up briefly because I don't want

76
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:48,539
to overwhelm everybody yet. Uh, but there's going to be a Halloween stream, secret slime actions.

77
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:56,419
You're going to be directly competing against me to not do the thing that you and I have come up

78
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:03,480
with over a series of 10 rounds. If I get slimed, I lose points. Each person in chat is worth one

79
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,919
point. So if you get eliminated, that's minus one point for the whole, all of you are working

80
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:21,259
together on this. There's no such thing as minus one. Well, there is now. You're going to lose.

81
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,539
I don't know. It depends. It depends on what you guys can come up with for actions and they

82
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:33,159
could be anything, but make them good. We'll talk more about this at the end of the stream.

83
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:40,700
I don't want to overwhelm you. Breathing. And no, it can't be anything like that.

84
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,460
Stuff that is required to survive is not a secret slime action. It's breathing.

85
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,200
Like air going in and out of your nose is not a thing that can slime me. Drinking water.

86
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,350
I mean, okay. What if like, if going to the bathroom is one of them and I get slimed in the

87
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:19,669
bathroom, that's so stupid. But we'll, we'll come up with some stuff. I want to give it to you now.

88
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:23,590
So you can start to preliminary think about it in your brain.

89
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:28,470
And those of you that have never seen any of the old Nickelodeon shows where they used to do weird

90
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,980
shit like this, I'm going to try to not do the things that you are. Cause remember, I don't know.

91
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,340
I'm not going to know what you guys are suggesting. The people running the show have all that

92
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:48,279
information. So I don't know. Oh, Hey, by the way, don't, uh, don't sneeze this round. I don't know

93
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,600
what is potentially picked, but it just comes from a pool of things that you guys have suggested.

94
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:00,139
Also, I want to talk about this too. This is a talk about stuff stream.

95
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,899
A week or two after that, I'm going back in front of the green screen.

96
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:10,179
We're going to do green screen DLC for free. This is going to be the name of that stream.

97
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,690
We're going to do a whole nother thing where we take in more of your suggestions for actions

98
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,500
over the course of a couple of weeks. And I'm going back in front and we're going to give you

99
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:39,799
guys more material because it makes me laugh every time. So I don't want to throw this all

100
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:49,779
at you at once, but that stuff is happening. He's stalling the stream. He hates dark wood.

101
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:03,799
Happy Halloween from this company to spider. All right. For a second, I thought that was coffee

102
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,679
and I was about to gag. It's lemon water. I don't know why I thought it was an ice coffee.

103
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,139
So we're in dark wood. We're going to continue. We're going to play dark wood. I'm going to try

104
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,820
to finish dark wood. I might. I don't know. Is it going to be tough to get to the end of this?

105
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:30,700
We'll see. We're on day 19. We will find out if I can do it or not. This might be a situation

106
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,340
where I play for like six hours and go, we'll finish it later. Or I might just Simpsons hit and

107
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:52,659
run sit here until it's done. But we left off. I'm so fucking excited for this stream. I can't

108
00:13:52,659 --> 00:14:00,809
wait for the slot, the secret slime Halloween stream. You even examine seven hours. I have to

109
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:08,169
sleep. Well, I'll try to get it done in seven hours. So I'll get done in five. And there are

110
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:10,809
people that are going to be coming into the stream. That's why I didn't want to throw it all out at

111
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:15,700
the beginning and just, it is an overwhelming amount of information that I think is better

112
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,460
if just like read in a discord because I'm going to write up a whole thing for you guys to like

113
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,700
read in the pinned channel there. There'll be two channels. One of them would be for discussions

114
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,899
on things that you want me to, but not that you want me to do things that you think I will do

115
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:37,899
that I don't know. And one for obviously a single sentence of what that thing is.

116
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:45,659
We'll talk about it again at the end of the stream. So the last thing I remember is we

117
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:56,870
organized the workbench. Don't, don't put them in here. I don't want to see them. Are you trying

118
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,759
to win this competition or you want me to be prepared for when it happens? And some of these

119
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,320
rounds, by the way, once we get to like round five, six, seven, eight, there might be multiple

120
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,399
actions that if you do, you know, if there might be three or four things on the screen that I can't

121
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:25,000
do, we're going to make it hard. And you too don't get banned blinking. No, that's, that's a human

122
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,909
survival reaction that doesn't count. All right. So the last thing I was going to do was that the

123
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:40,389
wolf, the wolf told me, Hey, you got to go up here now. Cause here's the hideout up here.

124
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,110
And there's a, there's a spot here that I'm going to go up and I'm going to just get to

125
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:53,129
the hideout, new hideout incoming. Look, look, look, look, look. You guys are on like, all right.

126
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:10,309
Cool. I guess anyways, uh, what do I have? I have, I need some new armor. I got to kill a bug.

127
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,429
I also have, I need to take some stuff with me because this is the journey

128
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:23,289
to go to the next hideout. I need a couple of things. Gas. I'm going to bring some wood and

129
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:31,559
I'm going to bring a bunch of nails. What else do I want to bring with me to survive this place?

130
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:43,049
To, to have an, okay. The bandages. I need alcohol. All right. This goal is just to get to the

131
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:49,269
hideout, the new hideout. I think everything else is fine. What about batteries? Yeah. I'll take a

132
00:16:49,269 --> 00:17:00,419
couple of batteries, a couple of things of gas, get this bottle out of here. Scrap metal. Let me

133
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:08,549
take that too. All right. I'm ready to get out of here and try to get to the next hideout.

134
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,309
Jerma's current score is minus 46. That doesn't count. People did minus one, like a hundred,

135
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:25,579
a hundred times. How, how do I already have minus 40? No, I'm serious. How do I already have minus

136
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:33,500
46? I haven't done anything. I haven't said anything. I talked about like, what is this? Reddit?

137
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:53,400
Gave us a little low. All right. Let's go. I'm going. Uh, so, uh, the fastest route is to go

138
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,789
all the way up left and up. I have bandages. Let me put those bandages on. I got pills too.

139
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:10,150
And I got lock picks. I'm ready. Let's put the, no, the pills. No bandages. Okay. Go for it.

140
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,440
Time to go to a new hideout and do the, uh, this third little zone up here,

141
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:25,400
cause that's where I need to go. You forgot the bell. Wow. I almost just ruined this whole place

142
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:35,259
for you. I almost just just forgot those things hurt you already up to a great start. All right.

143
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:45,640
Come on. Give me the bell. Who the hell's the bell? Is this just in like a wardrobe somewhere?

144
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:56,569
There it is. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's go out. Out. Let's go new hideout.

145
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:16,140
I got plenty of time. Do I still use a Velcro wallet? What the fuck are you talking about?

146
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:35,210
No, I wish I still had Velcro shoes. Velcro shoes are awesome because they allow you

147
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:41,779
Velcro shoes are just so easy to put on. All right. I got two people. Let's go.

148
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,970
He's getting better. Take the rag, leave the bottle. Let's go. Not wasting time.

149
00:19:52,410 --> 00:20:01,769
Velcro underwear. I, that doesn't make any sense. The bike man's not going to get stuff out of the

150
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:10,329
wardrobe. It's too late. I fucking, if today was a secret slime stream, just do step in poison

151
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:25,960
mushrooms. I would, it would happen immediately. He gets everything in the hideout. Well, why are

152
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,920
you yelling at me? That's what somebody in chat just, that's what people in chat were telling me.

153
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:43,099
Well, I, why is everybody yelling at me? I left it in there. Okay. I need to heal with no, not yet.

154
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:49,059
It's not, I'm not, it's having that one. Okay. I'm probably going to need to heal. Found a cottage.

155
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:59,990
I haven't seen this yet. Why? Get out of here. Oh my fucking God. Really? No, not really. You're

156
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:15,180
still, he's just tracking me. Dude, get the fuck out of here. I don't want to, now I have to heal.

157
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:36,809
Whatever. I, I need to see what's in here. No, I'm on a very specific mission. I can do it later.

158
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:56,089
The hunter becomes the hunted. So I'll go up from here. Moose Monka S. I know it's

159
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:07,420
scary. Old car. Ooh, broken truck. Let's take another thing of gas, scrap. Hello. What is it?

160
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:23,140
Keep going. Just get it. I got to get to the hideout. I got to focus. The wolf told me to go up here

161
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:35,130
and I need to get up there before it gets too dark so I can get a sanctuary ready. Nothing else.

162
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:42,660
Don't pick up anything. Don't do anything. Just get up there. Watch out for the poison.

163
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:56,230
Straight line. The best way to go. I have to be getting close. Give me a landmark. All right,

164
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:06,230
here we go. I'm right here. Is this it? Is this the entrance? Am I going the right way?

165
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:26,710
Scrap. Nice. Still over here. Found the bridge. Here we go. Uh, I'm gonna take the wood.

166
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:34,819
So now I gotta get, that's kind of far away. Am I gonna even get here in time?

167
00:23:35,539 --> 00:24:08,390
I might have to. He's just zigzagging. Oh, that's so bad. Red meat. Okay, hold on. I need to make a.

168
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:36,940
This shit is important. Besides the tire. All right, get me out of here. I got such a long way

169
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:57,539
to. Is another one of these? Oh, for the love of God. Well, this sucks. He's still alive. Why is

170
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:34,869
he still alive? Damn it. This is going to suck. You're telling me that's what's up here? That's

171
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:42,089
what I have to be aware of now. That's what I have to deal with every time. It's no longer the guys

172
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:53,349
with the. I have a long way to go to that hideout. Whatever it is, I'll get it later. Creepy house.

173
00:25:53,349 --> 00:26:03,529
Don't go to the creepy house. Just go to where I need to be. Is this like slender? Yeah, it's

174
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:13,990
essentially it's top down slender. Oh shit. This stuff that I know. Just go just get out. I can

175
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:32,390
come back here later. I can't climb this here. Almost there. Almost like halfway there. All right,

176
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:40,759
it's time to activate the runner. Go. No, no unnatural. No unnatural walling. No natural

177
00:26:40,759 --> 00:27:00,339
walling. Please. Oh, that's a guy. Broken tree. Get in there. Almost there. Come on. Don't die.

178
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:40,779
I need that axe too. Bad. I'm getting lots of meat though. Yeah, I am. All right, come on. Where is

179
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:49,670
this? Here we are. Come on. This is it, right? Lots of wood over here. Keep this in mind. Somebody

180
00:27:49,670 --> 00:28:12,920
remember this. Let's make a good hideout. Oh yes, it would. Turn on the stove. Nobody's in here,

181
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:25,339
right? There might be somebody hanging out in here though. Turn on the stove. This is actually sick.

182
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,779
This place is huge. I'm just gonna hide in the bathroom. Left 4 Dead 2 style.

183
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:54,019
Oven. There we go. Light the oven. Awesome. 240 extract. 240, 240, 240. That's a shitload. Nice.

184
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:07,720
All right. Very, very good. Where's the workbench? Here. How do I get over there?

185
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:33,240
Go like down and then around? The fucker. Here's the workbench. Sickle. Oh, is this better than a

186
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:52,390
shovel? All right, what else is over here? It's not better than a shovel, huh? Okay. All right,

187
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,910
let me get, let me fill up the gas because I'm running out of time here. I gotta start to really

188
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:16,180
think about how I'm gonna do this. I tried to pick it up. I tried to pick it up. Okay, hold on.

189
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:32,019
I gotta deposit some of this shit. Now keep that. Get the bell for the batteries away.

190
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:39,529
I put two of the gasoline tanks away with the wire and the nail. All right. Now I can actually do

191
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:47,859
this shit. It's so dark in here. This is so much darker than the other ones. I wonder if I'm like

192
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:57,849
stepping on like the bird shit on the ground. Okay, I'm ready to fill up the generator, which is

193
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,809
over here. Where the fuck is the generator? There's the cooking table. It's over here.

194
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:26,950
Okay, gas tank. Spill it up. I got some time. I'll call the guy tomorrow to bring my stuff.

195
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:42,099
All right, tank is empty. 16. I got, let me see. So this can't be repaired. So they can come in this

196
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:50,819
way. They can come in this way. So generator room is off limits. I can repair. This is all right,

197
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:56,099
but no, not really. It's tiny. They can also come through here and they can come through here.

198
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:09,059
Not ideal. Here's one of the lights. This room not ideal either. Maybe down here. All right, so

199
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:17,900
all right. Okay, I like this area. I can board this. Okay, this is two doors here. I board this one

200
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,880
and then there's no, this window barricade, this window. Let's just do it now.

201
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:33,220
So that's window barricaded, which leaves me with this from here. There's the workbench. There's a

202
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:41,609
way to get in this way. No windows, no other ways to get in here. There's that. Okay, so what about,

203
00:32:41,609 --> 00:33:02,359
what if I just hang out in this hall? Window here. Shit. Window here, barricaded. The window,

204
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:12,309
there's only two windows in this. Okay, wooden door. There's a lot of open space here. The safest

205
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:21,130
place in this whole house is probably right here. Like right here. Down, like in this bottom hallway.

206
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:32,440
There's a lot of places they can get in. Or in here, but you get stuck in here. I don't know,

207
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:46,140
I'm running out of time though, so I have to do this now. I could go like this and put traps

208
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:58,779
everywhere. Hold on. Let me make a few traps. Let me go to the workbench. Fuck. There's too many

209
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:03,180
rooms for me to think about what I want to do. I only have like eight minutes to figure this out.

210
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:13,989
When I built my house in Minecraft, it took me like four hours. What about up here? Barricade

211
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:26,460
this. Okay. Barricade this door too. I think this is all right right here for the first night. Oh,

212
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:34,250
check this out. Watch this. Door right here is all right. They, this is, I'm gonna barricade

213
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:46,940
this door. So check this. I can be up here. They can come in through this door. I have barricaded

214
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:54,889
window, barricaded door. There's an entry here. There's also an, oh, all right. This might be a

215
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,949
pretty good spot to be here. I need the, I need the light. I need the lights. I need the lights

216
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:07,860
right now. It's fucking dark. Give me a break. I can't see shit. I'm just turning the fucking

217
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,949
generator on. I don't even know where anything is in this house. There's only one light. There's

218
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:32,679
only one lamp here. Oh, that's not good. Um, just get all the windows. This is coming to the hall

219
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:37,800
just for tonight. And then tomorrow when I have infinite time, I can figure this out. This is

220
00:35:37,800 --> 00:36:03,219
coming over here. Make sure I have like a weapon. This is gonna be hell. Okay. So they can't,

221
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:11,190
there's no way to get in through here unless they break that wall. I can bring the wardrobe over to,

222
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,070
wait, I need items. I need items right now. Where's the workbench? I don't remember where

223
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:24,230
the workbench is. It's like down here. Okay. Um, battery. I still have a magazine. I still have

224
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:36,630
the shovel. Store this stuff. There's heels. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I have some heels.

225
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:41,860
Speaking of heels, I got like a second. Okay. No, no, no, no. Get me in.

226
00:36:46,699 --> 00:37:07,099
All right. I can't barricade this door. I'm gonna have to go for it. Two points of entry.

227
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Is there anything I can grab here? Like a chair or something right off the bat?

228
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:29,320
I need to stop moving. Stop, stop, stop, just stop, stop, stop, stop. Close the door. Oh,

229
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:35,480
fuck. What is it? But what is it though? What kind of enemy is it?

230
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:45,989
Will he savage? I have a place to run. Keep that in mind. I have a place to run below me.

231
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:53,530
And I'm still in the house and I can wrap around. Holy shitty left.

232
00:37:53,530 --> 00:38:07,619
A dog. A dog just saved my life. A dog just saved my life. No, he didn't. He just got one hit KO.

233
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:42,119
Point blank right in the head. What is it? Is he gonna break the door?

234
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:51,909
It's just a dog. I'm gonna open the door and hit him. Oh, fuck. Did I break the door?

235
00:38:55,639 --> 00:39:18,889
Where is it? Oh shit. It's down there. It doesn't know he can go around. I'm gonna aim here.

236
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:29,349
Cause there's something in the house. Where is it? Oh shit. Okay. I gotta be ready.

237
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:59,559
What is it? Dog. I'm in trouble now. Where is it? Oh my God. It's right there.

238
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:50,949
Take it. Ta. Why? I'm gonna move. It's three big dogs. So what happened? One of the dogs

239
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:57,659
ate the other dog. What am I drinking? That is water with a little bit of lemon in it.

240
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:01,460
Just gives it just enough a little bit of a kick.

241
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:16,150
Oh my God. It's a 1-8. Please. Was that two? Was that you guys? Was that somebody in chat?

242
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:28,550
Did I just get stream sniped? They both came in instantly and attacked me instant. What?

243
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:47,659
Where the fuck were they for the last like hour and 40 minutes? Yeah, it's water. God damn it.

244
00:41:47,659 --> 00:42:13,800
It was like 730. That sucks. Pain in the ass. All right. So now that I have a minute to look.

245
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:25,619
Let me turn the generator off first. That's important. Died to lemon water. If I had my

246
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:33,190
hands on... I have to like talk with my fucking hands. Why can't I just sit here? What's going

247
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:47,480
on in this room? That... No, I didn't die to lemon water. I died to animated speaking. Well, you see

248
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,800
just a little bit of a kick of that lemon juice. The lemon... Oh, and there's... Oh, hold on. I'm

249
00:42:51,800 --> 00:43:12,570
playing a game over here. All right. Generator's off. I have infinite time. Now let's go over a

250
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:22,889
strategy. This is not a terrible strategy, but it's not a lot of room to move. So I think I want to

251
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:31,420
be in here. There's enough places to move. I could potentially barricade this room as well with the

252
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,699
oven. And then if only I can... There's a door here. I can barricade this and need to worry about

253
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:49,559
these two spots. Trap. Let's check this out. Trap. Trap. Trap. This is where I'm going. This is the

254
00:43:49,559 --> 00:44:05,110
one. There's three mushrooms in here. I'm going to step on them. If I step on one trap for the

255
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:20,840
remainder of this stream, I will do a spin in a circle. All right. So go back to the cooking

256
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:35,449
utensil thing. Here we go. Level up. We have a new tier. Careful step. Once a day, you won't trigger

257
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:45,400
a trap that you step on. If I step on enough trap for the rest of the day, I'll be able to restore

258
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:55,699
my health by eating wood. Once a day, I'll be able to scare off nearby enemies. Yes. I don't care

259
00:44:55,699 --> 00:45:02,179
what the other ones do. I'll recover longer after exhausting myself. When my stamina gets low,

260
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:09,590
I will deal less damage in combat. These are both so awful. Just eat your way out of the forest.

261
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:23,320
Eat wood. Eat wood. Eat your desk. Bite your desk. That is good. But I feel like this is a...

262
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:38,920
If I had this, I probably would have survived the night last night. Yeah. And this one too. I

263
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,900
don't want it. This one seems horrible. When my stamina gets low, I'll deal less damage in combat.

264
00:45:43,900 --> 00:46:00,920
They're both horrible. They're both just game ruiners. Which one is worse? I don't know.

265
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:09,400
Weaklings only happens when you put your stamina at zero. Yeah. All right. All right. All right.

266
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:33,219
All right. All right. It's done. Eat wood, Omega Lull. Oh, I get what you're doing. Okay. Now

267
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:49,219
let's go over here. The smell of grass and trees. The earth bends under my footsteps. The sky swirls

268
00:46:49,219 --> 00:47:01,349
pleasantly. I think it's here. Bugs haven't even had two headphones in this whole time.

269
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:13,219
That's why I've been so bad. Oh, I wasn't expecting this. A completely ordinary dead

270
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:25,300
man with a smile on his face. Is that a... Is that a... Is that a monkey? I think. I don't know. I'm

271
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:44,820
not sure what to say in the chat. Can you hear it? This is actually kind of scary. Can you hear it?

272
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:56,150
Yes, it's you. It's me. Can you hear their song? Get out of here. Get out of here, you

273
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:04,340
fucking man-o-wraith. You pre-spell. They deleted you from the game because you sucked.

274
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:16,940
Now what's that? What's that? Oh, it's a live stream from German 985.

275
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:34,570
Gotta have one wow reference per stream. The game sucks. All right. What we got? What? Why

276
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:54,809
did that happen? Oh, I have one of these. 4,000. I'm already 20% of the way there. Not even. I'm 20...

277
00:48:54,809 --> 00:49:16,489
I'm 22% of the way there. I'm 20% of the way there. Let's see. Where do I want to go?

278
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:41,380
German is sweating. Why am I sweating? It's been like 50 minutes. It's your overreactive glands.

279
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:52,219
It's been like 10 minutes. It's been an hour. That's how you know that this stream is

280
00:49:52,219 --> 00:50:06,780
popping. I got like my YouTuber glands. All right. I'm so glad I have frozen time.

281
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,949
So I need to make traps. I need scrap metal. I got a little bit. I can make like two, three.

282
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:34,460
What the fuck do I want to do now? Turn off the webcam. Why would it turn? All right. One guy.

283
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:48,809
I'm back. So traps. Let's build them. Let's build them. Let's build them. Let's build them. Let's

284
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:54,809
build them. Need to be the workbench. I want bear traps because they're the best.

285
00:50:58,409 --> 00:51:06,469
He's already... He's already forgotten where the workbench is because this whole game is gray

286
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:12,250
with some orange in it. And he's sometimes... His brain cannot decipher between orange and gray

287
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:31,829
because he didn't pay attention in school. Bear trap. Make three of them. These are going to help

288
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:40,389
me out immensely very soon. Speak up a little. Okay. Fine. Well, there goes the scrap. I needed

289
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:46,949
to make sure I could have a weapon, but it's okay. I'll find some. Now these are going to go over

290
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:52,070
here. Let's... I think this is the best spot for me. Might not be the best spot for you

291
00:51:52,949 --> 00:52:00,550
because I can barricade this door. I can hang out in here. I can have a piece of furniture. Once

292
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:05,510
this guy gets out of the way, let's get this one down here first. Actually, I actually more

293
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:33,429
comfortable having this down here. So if I do this... Can the dogs jump over the table? I don't

294
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:40,199
think the dogs can jump over it. Maybe they can. That's a good question. Anyways, here we go.

295
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:51,980
I'm thinking of a scenario where we take these three. Let me go like this. Put something here

296
00:52:51,980 --> 00:53:01,340
and then right here. Bang. They'll get caught in it if they turn. There's one. And then that'll

297
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:08,730
give me time. I'm gonna put a piece of furniture here and then one here. I'm gonna... Where am I

298
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:16,150
gonna stand though is the real question. Stand... I'll be standing here because against my back

299
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:20,309
against this wall, nobody can get in this way. This corner is pretty good. So if I stand up here,

300
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:24,230
that means that this would have to go here because they would be... Essentially, they break through

301
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:34,630
and they'd be running up this way. So right there. God, I hope this is right. Okay. The third one

302
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:47,300
is gonna go down here. Right here. Because they'll break open the door and they'll come up this way.

303
00:53:47,860 --> 00:54:09,719
I am now ready. Oh, fuck. It's ready. The room is good. There's my entrance.

304
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:22,659
There's my other entrance. I hope I can get back in there. I... When I come back, when I come back

305
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:29,909
and I... When you see my character Avatar walk through these doors, please, for the love of God,

306
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:40,440
I want everybody collectively to type in all capitals. Bear traps. It's the only thing I

307
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:47,369
want to see over here because I'm gonna forget this exists in like 30 minutes when I come back

308
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:55,460
after scavenging out here. And I'll walk in one and it'll... I'll go like this. Oh, what the fuck?

309
00:54:56,659 --> 00:55:14,869
And everyone will be like... I was ready. And then I'll be irritated. All right. I'll take a

310
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:21,590
mushroom. I have an axe head. What do I need to build the axe? That's very important to me.

311
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:28,139
I'm gonna scrap. How many nails do I have? I'm gonna buy them all. I have plenty of money.

312
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:33,340
This guy... This guy loves me. So like he's just gonna give all this shit to me.

313
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:48,139
Another magazine for the gun. Gas tank. All right. We'll take this one up. He nods. Okay.

314
00:55:48,139 --> 00:56:05,210
I need Joe. All right. Fuck. I thought I stepped in the trap. I have to cook this. Jesus Christ.

315
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:11,050
What the fuck am I doing? I don't want to come back in this room till I have to.

316
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,739
They need to be placed though. They have to be there. All right. I'm ready. That's the

317
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:28,900
survive room. I'm gonna bring the light over there too before anybody starts to panic.

318
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:44,550
Get the rags and a battery. I got plenty of lock picks. I took the magazine. All right. Let's do

319
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:51,880
this thing. Disarm them now and then arm them at night. That's a very decent chance. That's

320
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,159
a very decent debate there. But if you dismantle them, you get two scrap and they take three to

321
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:09,690
make. Why would somebody have that as an emote? I just thought something was wrong with my channel.

322
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:19,559
All right. I want to make sure I don't forget anything that was in these boxes. I know there

323
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:24,940
was some shit around here. That room is good to go. Here we go. Wardrobe, pills, rags.

324
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:32,099
Forget anything. I'm gonna grab the lamp just to get it over there so I don't panic later.

325
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:57,780
Ah. Ring the bell. That's also a good idea. I will do that too. I think I can just run it in there

326
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:05,019
now or at least close enough. How am I gonna get this in the room with the bear traps? I'm gonna

327
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:12,380
carefully do that now because if when it's like 17 o'clock that is not gonna happen. I will panic

328
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:17,019
and I will activate like three of the traps. There are only three traps in there so you know what I

329
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:40,739
mean. Can you help? This one is just gonna it's not gonna catch this in the trap, right?

330
00:58:55,579 --> 00:59:24,599
Easy. We're good. I can stick right there. I like this setup. That's going down and then I'll put

331
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:36,969
something else up here. Any of the big furniture around here? There's got to be like a big piece

332
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:56,519
of furniture I can drag, right? Workbench. There's a wardrobe. Welder. Gentleman magazine? Bear trap.

333
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:00,840
I know the bear traps are in there. I know the bear traps are in that room. I'm talking about

334
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:14,230
for like like 35 minutes from now when I leave and come back. It's fun to decorate your house.

335
01:00:14,869 --> 01:00:34,059
So this one's gonna go up because that one's gonna block that doorway. Leave. Is that gonna

336
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:42,550
be enough to block? I don't think so. No it's it's enough it's enough to be annoying though

337
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:51,239
so I can know when someone's coming in. No it's all right. That's not terrible. That's enough to

338
01:00:51,239 --> 01:01:02,760
be annoying. Stop being mean to the trader. Kidding. All right I'm I'm happy with that.

339
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:12,059
I wish I could repair my shovel because that's did I get I got more nails but did I get enough

340
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:35,139
to let's see. Oh I do okay I do I do I do just no I don't. Fuck. I okay I need to use the bell.

341
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:51,369
Something's happening. I'll give you an alcohol. Do I have alcohol in my inventory? Where is he?

342
01:01:54,360 --> 01:02:06,860
Front door? Back door? Oh this is big. I can pick that up. I'll move that later. Where's this guy?

343
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:33,079
I know but where are you? Kill trader. Where's the guy on the bike? I just heard his bell like twice.

344
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:46,309
Oh you're all the way out here. Uh here's some alcohol. A good vintage. Your bottle a day keeps

345
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:51,739
the monsters away to your health. I can bring you junk from the other hideout. Which hideout

346
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:57,420
should I take the junk from boss? From the silent forest. Oh on it like a fox in a trash can.

347
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:16,760
See you later. First course of action is where what did the let me look at my journal. I remember

348
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:25,019
the face face of the man who saved me. Where's um wolf? Northwestern part of the dry meadow.

349
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:32,860
It's up here. Okay so that's not that far. Let's get out of the place.

350
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:43,400
I'm gonna go do that. I do need a couple pieces of wood though to repair my shovel. I don't feel

351
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:54,550
comfortable going up there. Did I look at everything? Make sure I did. No. Note. Who the hell are they

352
01:03:54,550 --> 01:04:01,590
assigning to us? Macy's fucked off from the shack. The whole night he was rambling about some merrick.

353
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:05,429
I think his younger brother or son. I don't know if it was the boredom of the stress that got to

354
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:12,010
him but he was fucking unbearable. It was the third night in a row. We tried to silence him but

355
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:17,769
it's fucking Masiak. Better not risk it. I slipped inside my sleeping bag and zipped it shut. I

356
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:24,170
prefer to suffocate in my own stench than listen to that fuckhead go on and on about it. After a

357
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:28,889
while I realized Masiak is not there anymore. He left around morning. He took all his equipment,

358
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:37,000
three liters of water, a sleeping bag, radio, gun, gasoline, flamethrower and his lucky stone. He only

359
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,199
left the hazard suit. We're debating on whether to report this. No one's crazy about running around

360
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:50,360
the woods looking for psycho with a flamethrower. Well we'll know who that is if we come across them.

361
01:04:53,480 --> 01:05:01,269
Checking one few more little things. Any objects that I missed. I can get wood right here. Thanks

362
01:05:01,269 --> 01:05:23,079
to the person in chat that told me there was wood out here. The saw needs gas. Prepare the shovel.

363
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:43,699
This is the wrong place. Chicken lady's despair. The wolf didn't want to talk to me anymore. He

364
01:05:43,699 --> 01:05:48,809
grunted that he had something urgent to take care of and rushed off. If this is wall brain,

365
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,199
thinks that he will get rid of me so easily, then he's mistaken. He mentioned he'll be staying in

366
01:05:54,199 --> 01:06:03,820
the northeastern part of the old woods. So over here. I was going up here. So he's up there.

367
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:14,820
That's not bad. Good to know. Let's get some logs. And now let me repair my shit.

368
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:32,039
Good. I should be able to repair the shovel. And then we move. We move. That's just north.

369
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:48,230
No north. I flipped it around. Wait, hold on. I um northeast. I used to I used to live in the

370
01:06:48,230 --> 01:07:08,809
northeast. Don't queue. I should know what that is because I have these headphones in.

371
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:13,940
If I had both these headphones out, I could feel my brain power coming back.

372
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:24,659
It's like breathing again. When they're in, I can fucking breathe again when they're out.

373
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:41,460
Somebody just say because I'm a vegan. What the fuck are you talking about?

374
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:57,380
What does that even mean? All right. Nothing else from you that I want. Let's do it.

375
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:07,579
Workbench. Prepare the shovel. Make sure I have healing items. Good. Upgrade item. Maybe I can.

376
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:21,829
No, I can't. Take the proper healing. And we're going northeast. Bandage. Looking good. These

377
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:28,760
flares. I'm gonna sell them. Make make two bandages. Why not two? Make, you know, make another one of

378
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:36,569
these. And then another one of these. Put the welder away. I might need it for something.

379
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:44,699
We don't need the wood. We do not need this scrap metal. We do not need the weapon parts.

380
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:49,609
We do not need the we need the battery. We need one battery. I think that's sufficient. We need

381
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:53,050
the two clips. We don't need the rags anymore. Actually I do. Maybe you can. No, I don't. I got

382
01:08:53,050 --> 01:09:00,819
plenty healing. Flashlight. Two. Nails. Go away. Don't need these pills. Welder. Go away. Bottle.

383
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:09,930
Alcohol. Here we go. Get rid of that bandage. I got three. Get rid of the flares. Three healing.

384
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:25,340
One battery. Two clips. Any food? No. Let's go. I'm ready. Lockpicking. You're right. Take the five

385
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:49,909
stack. And that's it. Good to go. So we're going up here northeast. Nice bangs. I'm gonna get angry.

386
01:09:50,949 --> 01:10:22,579
I mean it right here. Just let's go. You guys want some Pringles? Pringles are awesome.

387
01:10:25,029 --> 01:10:35,939
Actually I take that back. Original Pringles are awful. But cheese Pringles are like B tier.

388
01:10:37,699 --> 01:11:15,029
I fucking can not do it. Of course this is like a poison area. Why do you even live up here for?

389
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:46,649
Road. Wait. Road. That's not where I want to go. A natural walling here. It's gonna go all the way

390
01:11:46,649 --> 01:12:14,630
up. Gotta go down. Take me home. I have to go back through this shit. Slow it down. Barn ruins. Is he up

391
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:52,659
here? Dogs. Oh there's a lot of dogs. There's a lot of dogs here. A lot of them.

392
01:13:02,090 --> 01:14:11,140
Is this a dog? No. Could open it with a lockpick. What the hell is going on up here? Go down here.

393
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:43,130
Hey. Shit what's with all the dogs? And what's even up here?

394
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:28,699
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Why are you not on a hotbar?

395
01:15:29,659 --> 01:16:03,560
I don't want to shoot this gun. Everybody will know where I am. This fucking reach sucks.

396
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:52,119
Oh shit a dog is in front of me. It's two down. I thought this was going to be just a breeze to

397
01:16:52,119 --> 01:17:11,189
get back up here. Okay. I think this is already to go back up there though. Let's see. First of all,

398
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:31,220
get this on the hotbar. What are you dumb? Are you fucking kidding me?

399
01:17:31,380 --> 01:18:50,779
Is there nothing over here? No, there's this. Nothing. There's nothing in here.

400
01:18:51,739 --> 01:19:07,260
Where the fuck am I going? Is this a person? I found him. The greeting sounds like an angry

401
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:11,659
girl. The wolf makes a quick leap and bouncing against me with his swollen belly, he puts his

402
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:23,510
paws on my shoulders. He ostentatiously licks his face. What a gift you've given me. I notice

403
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:28,229
fresh blood stains on his fur and feel streaks of his saliva dripping onto my coat. He leans

404
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:42,899
towards me as if he wanted to say something to my ear. What? The wolf squeezes my arms and starts

405
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:47,140
licking my face, once from the left side, once from the right. Comrade, meet, his breath stinks

406
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:50,819
of rot. What would I ever do without you? You're not such a worthless piece of carcass as you look.

407
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:58,569
Next to you I feel fulfilled. I've got my girl, my sweet lady. Hard to believe the same blood

408
01:19:58,569 --> 01:20:04,979
flows through the veins of- I just got a rifle. This bitch reeks of chicken. What? Suddenly the

409
01:20:04,979 --> 01:20:08,739
wolf sends me back with a powerful push and reaches into his coat pocket, some object hits the floor.

410
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:14,659
Here, no need to thank me. Now, since that part of the deal is behind us, I'll help you recover

411
01:20:14,659 --> 01:20:19,300
your stupid key. I will take you back to the doctor's house. I'm sure you'll find some clues

412
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:25,220
on how to reach his current hideout while there. You two will have a little chat. You will get back

413
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:28,979
what you've lost and then nothing will keep you from getting the fuck out of my part of the woods.

414
01:20:28,979 --> 01:20:33,539
Do you get me, meet? You will pack your bags, dive into that stinking hole of yours and

415
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:42,329
dis a fucking pier. I appreciate the dis a fucking pier. Return to the doctor's house. And are we good?

416
01:20:43,750 --> 01:21:02,680
So he gave me a rifle. Are we good? I mean, I don't think so. I think I want more.

417
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:12,859
You don't got like a coupon back there for me somehow? I wonder, is the rifle any good?

418
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:35,140
Oh, are we good? Did I get it? Are we going? Huh? I can't seem to see. I need my glasses, I think.

419
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:45,420
Let's go. Wait, do I have the rifle? I had the earphones in. I'm telling you,

420
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:57,180
I don't know. There's something wrong with me. Let's go. I'm so glad I stuck that out.

421
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:03,130
I saw at least two or three people in the chat that said, get out, get out, stupid, get out, just

422
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:24,359
bad. And then they fucking almost passed out. Stupid and bad. Wait, where am I? All right. Look,

423
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:29,340
I'll agree with you. I am pretty stupid and I am pretty bad. Don't remind me. That's rude.

424
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:36,659
All right. Where am I? Where are we? Time is frozen.

425
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:52,779
I don't know why I know exactly what you're talking about. I think it's time for a change.

426
01:22:52,779 --> 01:22:55,420
No more, no more faces. I'm just going to be emotionless.

427
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:25,640
I just want to see it. Where's the rifle? Hunting rifle. What kind of bolts does that take?

428
01:23:26,600 --> 01:24:03,659
Medium, medium caliber. Pretty sick. Oh, geez. Bear trap, bear trap. There it was. We told you,

429
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:13,829
we told you, we told you, we told you about it. What's the single best episode of television

430
01:24:13,829 --> 01:24:26,819
you've ever seen in your whole life? Good choices there. I see a couple of good choices.

431
01:24:27,619 --> 01:24:32,899
Plain countryside bed. The metal buckles of the leather straps fastened to the bottom of the bed

432
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:50,550
are twisted and broken. SpongeBob pizza episode. I can't do anything with this person. Move you

433
01:24:50,550 --> 01:25:04,779
out of the way. I can't move him out of the way. Go in another part of the house then.

434
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:29,130
Can't go this way. All the way around. Um, is there a door here? I can't grab this. It's dark

435
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:34,250
in here. Give me a break. It's dark. The game is dark. By its very design, the game is designed

436
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:51,460
for you not to be able to see what you're doing. The doctor? Where is the doctor? Daddy went out

437
01:25:51,460 --> 01:26:03,479
and left. Angry and hungry he was. I'm hungry too. Don't get up. Can't move. Head is exploding.

438
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:23,720
And if I move, I'll burst myself. Here. No, that's not meat. Here, have some of this. Go get it.

439
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:40,300
It's delicious. Didn't want it. I tried. Partially decomposed corpse. The left hand has been

440
01:26:40,300 --> 01:27:07,779
bitten off together with the arm. That's disgusting. Oh, generator. The way to keep this

441
01:27:07,779 --> 01:27:26,619
stuff in time is frozen. It usually means odd stone. All right, I'll take it. Strange. Why is

442
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:40,300
this bed different when I come over? There's a way down a couple of ways down. Safe. Oh shit.

443
01:27:41,659 --> 01:28:00,840
Somebody's coming in here. Maybe not. Cage. Huge empty cages. Huge empty cages.

444
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:19,939
I saved the lock to the code. I don't know the code. 8-9-8-9-9-3. Was that a code?

445
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:47,909
No, those are shoes. Destroyed. Well, destroyed at 125p. What's the code for this? Do I have a code?

446
01:28:48,550 --> 01:29:09,880
Didn't go this way. Easy. I know him. Wait, this is the, this is the prologue. This is the guy.

447
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:40,859
Oh shit. Did I already open this? Um, you guys told me there was only one person that ate people

448
01:29:40,859 --> 01:30:21,210
in this game. Ice? Rotten mushroom. What do I do? How do I take this stuff? Okay. Battery. No. I have

449
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:34,500
to get back. This is worth a lot of money. This doesn't do anything. Thanks for wait, thanks for

450
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:58,979
not letting me waste time. I mean, I still want the ice though. Cooking ice. You can't cook it.

451
01:30:58,979 --> 01:31:02,840
Cook the ice. I'll take one stack. I've never seen it before. I don't know what it does.

452
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:27,500
All right, that's fine. Outside. Uh, can I jump this? I cannot. Nothing else over here.

453
01:31:28,140 --> 01:32:03,899
This is fucked up. This game is fucked up. I need a code. That's not shoe. Those are not shoes.

454
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:24,890
That's one five one five nine four one five four nine. I had the right idea with the shoes.

455
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:48,699
Just wrong place. One nine. What was it? Nine one nine one nine five four one nine. So that's not

456
01:32:48,699 --> 01:32:59,270
a one. This is just a five five four nine. That's not 15. Okay. That's just the piece here. Five four

457
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:46,100
nine. One nine. What's the other number? One five four nine. Photo. It's over. It's somewhere else,

458
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:49,859
Mr. Stupid. Zero viewers. Everybody left. They couldn't handle me looking at this. Like they

459
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:55,220
couldn't take me trying to find the safe code and they all took off. All of them. Uh, this is a photo.

460
01:33:58,729 --> 01:34:28,170
Eight five five four nine eight. Let's try that. Five four eight nine five eight four five nine.

461
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:54,859
There it is. Map code toy. Doctor's note with a code. The code to the cart door. 8909. 8909. Remember

462
01:34:54,859 --> 01:35:03,420
that. Note with a code. Okay. The map shows the location of some train. Train wreck. And then a

463
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:49,609
toy. Okay. I got my heel ready. I gotta get the fuck out of here. Free wood. Trees blocked the way

464
01:35:49,609 --> 01:36:26,229
ahead. So what the hell? Map? I can't use a map. Map. Map. I can't do that. Use a map. What? I can't

465
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:32,329
do that. I could probably just leave. Do I have to leave just all the way out? I think I did

466
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:42,359
everything I can. Wait. What about down here? I don't think I looked down here yet. There's

467
01:36:42,359 --> 01:37:00,250
not much to see anyway. So. All right. I'm just gonna leave. Yep. Time to go. He's too strong

468
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:14,899
to dismantle. Come on. We are out of here. My, my house also burst in half. Everything here just

469
01:37:14,899 --> 01:37:21,739
bursts. This person's freaking me out. I think they're gonna get up and chase me and shit.

470
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,939
I shouldn't. It's gonna be a scenario where I should have just killed him.

471
01:37:26,659 --> 01:37:41,460
Hey, you here? Are you good? Kill me. Take my house. My cracked hut.

472
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:53,609
Where do you live? Where do you live? Where do you live? Oh no. Where do you live?

473
01:37:54,569 --> 01:38:54,140
Okay. Rusty key. Like where? I don't know where you live. Oh, these mushrooms rotted because

474
01:38:54,140 --> 01:39:01,300
they took too long in here. Fuck. Are they worth anything? I got an axe. How does it swing?

475
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:08,300
Pretty nicely. Oh, pretty nice actually. I don't even need to build the damn thing.

476
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:21,979
I have an axe head. I can just sell it back. Oh, I can upgrade the axe. Holy shit. Now this is

477
01:39:21,979 --> 01:39:39,029
getting interesting. This thing's going to be insane. Hell yeah. All right. So I got, let me

478
01:39:39,029 --> 01:39:44,649
look at this. I've explored the doctor's house. It's a complete ruin. Now I know that what seemed

479
01:39:44,649 --> 01:39:49,210
like nightly terrors is very real. Still don't know how I escaped this place. I suspect someone

480
01:39:49,210 --> 01:39:55,800
must have carried me out. I found some code in the doctor's house. I don't know what it's

481
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:03,909
for, but I hope it opens the door to his current hideout. So I have the doctor's hideout. Go back

482
01:40:03,909 --> 01:40:27,420
to the tub. Check tub. Under the tub. Check under the tub. Rub-a-dub-dub. What's under the tub?

483
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:50,340
You're supposed to be helping me. This is what I think of your little tub joke.

484
01:40:50,819 --> 01:41:01,060
I didn't break the tub. I broke the door and almost destroyed the shovel.

485
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:10,170
Mean chat. Well, sorry. Look, sometimes I look over here and it's like,

486
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:18,649
holy shit. Read chat. You stupid idiot. You're so stupid. How could you not do this? And then

487
01:41:18,729 --> 01:41:32,390
that's a lie. But other times I can't see the word going on the screen. So it's hard

488
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:45,529
to determine. Like, he's blind. He's an idiot. Oh, the word was going not good if you just read it.

489
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:50,810
But then you guys can, because I know I do that, you guys can get me so easily with shit like that.

490
01:41:52,010 --> 01:42:03,460
Let's put it this way. You guys are a coin flip if you're legit or not. Why is it? Why did the

491
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:12,279
time change? All right. Where the hell am I? Where am I? Where did I just end up? Okay, right here.

492
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:18,550
Back to the house. I'm not. No, no, no. Gun. I don't care. Give me the gun.

493
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:30,619
It didn't hit. Pretty good dodge, I'll tell you. But I don't have time. Rotten mushroom's not worth

494
01:42:30,619 --> 01:42:57,590
anything, right? Yes, I know. It was a good dodge. Stupid, bald, manlit idiot. Why are you guys so

495
01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:05,500
mean? All right. Imagine, okay. Imagine if every time somebody said something in this chat that was

496
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:12,899
even remotely anything. You could say anything. Imagine if I referred to some of you guys as,

497
01:43:12,899 --> 01:43:20,100
oh, hey. Hey, what's up, you bald, manlit idiot? How you guys doing today? You're all bald,

498
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:25,659
manlit morons. How you guys doing? Don't you think? Don't you think you'd kind of be like,

499
01:43:26,949 --> 01:43:41,909
hey, hey, what? That was a little rude. All right, I'm gonna fuck this up. Just go down.

500
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:54,310
I'm out of gas. Just keep the gun out. He's yelling it. No, I'm not. Sometimes I think it's funny.

501
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:12,300
This is why I've kept the gun out. Let me try the axe. Imagine you went to work and your boss

502
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:22,170
greets you at the door. At the door. Okay, I don't want to die. Guys, I'm gonna die.

503
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:35,850
I'm dead. There's fucking three dogs here. Again, two of you came out of nowhere. Two people from

504
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:51,460
chat. Why are these open? Why are these, why are these open? Why are these undone? What the fuck

505
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:59,529
happened? I'm sorry. Yeah, two dogs just literally just spawned out of nowhere and a third one came

506
01:44:59,529 --> 01:45:04,979
and killed me. Why are these open? This is, this is horrible. Actually, this is terrible.

507
01:45:05,619 --> 01:45:11,800
This is awful. Why are these open? Why are these? I don't understand why these have been

508
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:20,859
done. Did somebody come in here? What I was going to say is imagine you like went into work and you

509
01:45:20,859 --> 01:45:27,750
boss the first thing in the morning. I'm gonna pause it for this. You walk in. Oh, hey. Oh, hey,

510
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:37,220
hey, boss. Hey, you bald manlit idiot. That motherfucker is getting sued for like harassment.

511
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:51,300
Can you imagine that like instant lawsuit? It'd be fucking immediate. Did I lose my rifle?

512
01:45:51,300 --> 01:46:00,090
Oh, I'm gonna do everything possible to get that back. No, I still have it. Okay, I'm gonna get my

513
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:22,090
stuff though. Why were those traps open? That's a bug. All right, get rid of this shit. I don't

514
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:28,600
even, I can't even use this stuff anymore. Store the hunting rifle for now. I need battery.

515
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:36,680
Don't scrap metal. That sucks. Why is it? Why did they do that? That's actually aggravating.

516
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:46,550
I died, so it activated two of my traps. All right. Oh, fuck off. I don't, I am not ready to take

517
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:58,390
off his stuff right now. I don't have time for this. I have to go get my stuff. Did he come in

518
01:46:58,390 --> 01:47:30,600
here and step on the traps? I don't have time for this shit. Every single individual item needs to

519
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:52,699
be ration stamps. What the fuck is this? Give me a break. I have no idea what to do here.

520
01:47:53,500 --> 01:48:03,020
Take these. Put them here. I'm gonna take the gas out. Put the shovel back. Nails. I mean,

521
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:12,300
just combine them. Why are they not auto-combined? What the hell? Anything else? Get rid of these

522
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:17,020
bottles. I don't even know what this rear view mirror is for. I'm afraid to delete any of these

523
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:24,409
items. I feel like I'm gonna need them. Where are those? Take one of these. Take these bottles out.

524
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:48,039
Make a few more healing things. What? What? Use the auto-combine key.

525
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:58,090
Phone on me. I'm gonna throw this off a cliff. I'm literally throwing this off a cliff, the next

526
01:48:58,090 --> 01:49:04,199
cliff I come to. This thing is going, I'm going to throw this as fucking hard as I can over the

527
01:49:04,359 --> 01:49:22,260
horizon. Okay, torch. I'm just gonna bring it. I can't combine that. This rotten meat is useless.

528
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:29,609
I'm gonna cook this stuff right now. I can't believe that those traps aren't there. There's

529
01:49:29,609 --> 01:49:58,300
still one. All right, let's go. Oh shit, okay. I can make like gas bombs? That's pretty ridiculous.

530
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:05,989
Metal pipe. I'll take the bottles with me. Whipping this off the cliff as hard as I can.

531
01:50:06,869 --> 01:50:14,579
And let's do another lockpick. Here we go. Let's do

532
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:28,420
bear trap. Upgrade item. Let me look at this. I need eight scrap for a greatly increased weapon

533
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:35,420
durability. That scared the shit out of me. Holy fuck. Why is that so much louder than the game?

534
01:50:35,979 --> 01:50:47,270
All right, I gotta get out of here. Store this for now. I need to go get my stuff

535
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:55,369
before it gets too late. All right, I have, where's my axe?

536
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:06,329
Fucking god, that's fine. All right, get me the fuck out of here. I gotta get my stuff.

537
01:51:06,890 --> 01:51:10,729
It's right next to the house. I can't believe I died there.

538
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:20,630
Oh, hold on. Fucking full moon. This has been a full moon chat the last three days.

539
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:27,909
Have you guys been drinking shit under the sink? What are you doing?

540
01:51:35,159 --> 01:51:43,739
All right, don't, I can't fuck this. I need my stuff. I, I know, I'm gonna get to those bits,

541
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:52,539
but I, it's 15 o'clock right now and I can't fuck this up. I don't remember where the hell that was.

542
01:51:53,939 --> 01:52:20,699
Oh, you piece of shit. You are so, what? Fucking hell. Oh, where's my bag?

543
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:36,090
Crate? Oh, there's, no. Oh, I just found my stuff. Did anybody remember where it was?

544
01:52:36,729 --> 01:52:48,460
It was like over here somewhere, right? What? I don't have time for you. Somebody can't,

545
01:52:48,460 --> 01:53:13,079
I don't have time for you. It's under the tub. Where's that? There it is. I got no more bullets.

546
01:53:13,079 --> 01:53:36,899
This is a horrendous scenario. Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave. I made it.

547
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:54,819
Woo. Oh, fuck. You guys are fucking with me. You guys are like, fuck with my head.

548
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:08,460
All right. You broke them. You got, all right. They were, 5,000 bits came in from phylactery

549
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:14,600
lidge. Thank you. First of all, that moment's going to be forever remembered because you have

550
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:19,850
a face cam. It's all right. It don't matter. Uh, Hey, Jeremiah, I'm glad you're streaming

551
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:25,210
cause I had a pretty bad day at work today. I got to work and said, Hey boss. And he called me a bald

552
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:37,270
idiot. It really hurt my feelings. Do you think I have a case for harassment? Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

553
01:54:37,909 --> 01:55:00,979
100%. Oh, you guys are fucking too much. Thank you for the 5,000 bits. Oh wait, I forgot. I have

554
01:55:00,979 --> 01:55:08,699
to do this before it becomes too dark out. I have it in my inventory, right? Yeah. Get it out of here.

555
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:23,270
Watch this. I'm just going to whip this shit into the woods here. Oh, what's that?

556
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:56,039
Something's going to chase me. It's a body of precious bone. Okay. 17 o'clock.

557
01:55:57,020 --> 01:56:09,100
Oh, this is such a mess. This is a mess in here. I'm just going to make these until I can't make

558
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:22,550
them anymore. I have like toxic fumes now. Okay. I'm going to make these bear trap. I can only make

559
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:34,579
one bear trap. This sucks. What a disaster. What a disaster. I have healing here. Don't need the

560
01:56:34,579 --> 01:56:39,939
lock picks right now. I have to, I'll do this tomorrow. I need to repair. Do I have Canada?

561
01:56:39,939 --> 01:56:47,180
I can't repair this. I need to scrap. Not good. That's all right. I don't have any bullets either.

562
01:56:47,180 --> 01:57:00,119
Yes, I do. I have one. I'm going to piss my pants. Okay. Where's my wood? Make sure everything's

563
01:57:00,119 --> 01:57:10,810
boarded up. Get these bottles out of here. I have reorganized this shit tomorrow. I just don't,

564
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:15,770
I don't know what to do with it all. I'm going to fill the generator. I've got my axe and I

565
01:57:15,770 --> 01:57:20,010
have a full clip and now that has to blast me. That has to blast me till tomorrow. That's just

566
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:39,619
all there is to it. Let's go. Can I cook anything else? No. Chad is a vicious mob. I'm telling you,

567
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:57,350
people don't think the full moon shit is real. It's not. You sure? What time is it where you are?

568
01:57:57,350 --> 01:58:01,670
Look out the window. There's a full, if there's a full moon and okay, if you look out the window

569
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:06,470
and there's a full moon and the last sentence you wrote in chat was like peepee, poopoo, bald,

570
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:20,569
mad streamer. I'm just saying it might have something to do with it. I need to move. Watch

571
01:58:20,569 --> 01:58:29,640
out. Watch out. Watch out. I need to board. I don't have time for this. Oh, I'm so screwed here.

572
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:41,369
That's at least closed. I'm not in the room though. I'm not in the room. I have to get in the

573
01:58:41,369 --> 01:58:56,869
room. Get in the room. 19. Ow, my hand. Good. This is blocked. There's a trap there already.

574
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:11,560
Close this door. Board it. Okay. This trap is going right here. Right like in front of me.

575
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:17,779
Because if somebody comes in this way, they'll get hit by it. Somebody comes in this way.

576
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:22,500
I don't know. It's this way. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know

577
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:59,140
where to put this. Should I put it right here? Not yet. I have the scream still. He looks strange

578
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:07,079
today. Come on into work. How are you? Good to see you again. Good to see you again, Dick.

579
02:00:07,079 --> 02:00:19,699
You look strange today. Okay. Bald idiot. I'm going to go to my desk. Yeah. Idiot. Bald head.

580
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:25,939
I can hear him still screaming. And he's just sitting there. He's sitting there with like

581
02:00:26,579 --> 02:00:41,260
under the sink cleaner in his hand. Bald. Whoa. This is fucked up. And then he goes,

582
02:00:41,739 --> 02:00:48,970
oh, there's a fucking full moon behind him. Okay. I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

583
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:47,460
It's been one hour. Can't do it. You can't do it. Uh oh. I got a good dent. What's that sound?

584
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:54,420
Oh no. Don't put, don't put the gas in here. Don't put it right under me. Don't put it right

585
02:01:54,420 --> 02:02:09,590
under me. If you put it right under me, I'm going to lose. Dog is just like smashing his head.

586
02:02:11,670 --> 02:02:23,779
Eventually, maybe you'll get it. Um, what happens if the ghosts come and turn the light off?

587
02:02:34,579 --> 02:02:39,220
What's that? Why is there a nuke in the house? Why is there a nuke in the house?

588
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:45,939
I don't know what that is. What does that mean? Why is there a nuke in the house?

589
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:55,989
Where is it and what is it? Something's trying to move this container and it has not successful

590
02:02:55,989 --> 02:03:14,310
yet. Hello? What is in the house? What is in the house? I need to heal. I need to heal.

591
02:03:16,899 --> 02:03:28,119
This motherfucker moves around the house. Get out of that room. Get out of that room. It's trapped.

592
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:39,380
Oh fuck. No, no. Move the, move the pre-hero. Please. It's 5 30. It's almost time. It's almost,

593
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:52,569
hey, hey, come on. It's almost time for work, Gerber. What was that? My house just shook.

594
02:04:16,939 --> 02:04:20,300
I was trying to go around this way. No.

595
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:59,960
No. I got halfway through that and I realized, stop. That's what happened to my brain.

596
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:07,239
In my mind, it was, I got halfway through and it, I, my brain went, stop. Don't do that. Stop it.

597
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:21,500
I want to see that clip. I want to see how fucking embarrassing that was.

598
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:28,899
I need to know. This is why I don't do face cam. It's like turd alert is coming up here.

599
02:05:29,859 --> 02:05:56,970
That wasn't even it. That's not, it's a baby. That's not, that's not, that's a baby. This is not it.

600
02:05:56,970 --> 02:06:05,800
Leave. Leave. Leave. What the fuck are you looking this for? It sounds like a baby.

601
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:20,729
That's, god damn it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate this. I hate this.

602
02:06:21,449 --> 02:06:32,810
Oh, I hate this. This image over here. Oh, I hate this. I'm fucking, I'm never streaming again.

603
02:06:32,810 --> 02:06:47,909
This is the last stream ever. I'm going to go hide for the rest of my life. Got fired. All right.

604
02:06:47,909 --> 02:07:03,500
Let's keep going. Turn off the generator. I made it. I made it. I, I tried, I, but give me a little

605
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:13,220
bit slack. I didn't, I don't know what that thing was. This red sun glowing nuclear bomb

606
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:16,819
just appeared in my room. I'm going to panic a little. I don't know what that is.

607
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:32,199
Imagine ending your career by a wooing. Imagine that really is the last thing I ever do.

608
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:41,510
No, we got a Halloween stream to do it. That's not going to happen. All right.

609
02:07:41,989 --> 02:08:01,060
Ahem. Train wreck. I had a note to go to the train wreck. Anything cool planned for Halloween

610
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:06,739
this year? Yeah. This is going to be an incredibly elaborate stream. Me versus you. Secret slime

611
02:08:06,739 --> 02:08:10,260
actions. You're going to try to slime me by, I'll go over it again at the end of the stream. It's

612
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:14,739
going to be a, it's going to be a whole thing. Oh, that's right. Like a bunch of people are here.

613
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:19,220
Long story short, there's going to be a channel in the discord that's going to be opened up

614
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:23,859
for you to give suggestions on secret slime actions from me that I do not know about.

615
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:26,420
There's going to be a discussion channel and there's going to be a suggestion channel.

616
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:29,939
Discussion channels for discussion. Suggestions for one sentence on what you think it should be.

617
02:08:29,939 --> 02:08:34,340
Bingo. No discussion in that channel. By the way, at the 30th, the October 31st,

618
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:36,819
that's when it's probably going to happen. You're the 30th, 31st. One of those days,

619
02:08:36,819 --> 02:08:41,699
I'll give you a good hard concrete one. But me versus you, you also have slime actions as well

620
02:08:41,699 --> 02:08:45,220
because we're going to come up with some stuff that you're not allowed to write in the chat.

621
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:47,939
And it's a competition because if you write something that you're not supposed to write

622
02:08:47,939 --> 02:08:52,420
you don't know about, then you are banned from that game and you lose points as a collective chat.

623
02:08:53,380 --> 02:09:05,079
Boom. A wooing is going to be on there. That's fine. You'll know. I'll never do that again.

624
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:09,479
This is the first and last time you will ever see me or hear me do that. Do not suggest

625
02:09:10,039 --> 02:09:16,359
the awoo as a thing to do on that stream because it will never happen again. I promise.

626
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:26,170
I 100% guarantee you that I will never turn and do the cookie crisp howl because that's what it's

627
02:09:26,170 --> 02:09:34,619
in my head. Every time I've gone, the thing, I'm just thinking of cookie crisp every time.

628
02:09:34,619 --> 02:09:44,970
I've done it like probably 10 times in my life. You still have to spin. I did. You didn't see me

629
02:09:44,970 --> 02:09:58,939
go around a circle? Do it again. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got all the time in the world now.

630
02:09:59,979 --> 02:10:09,159
I need to get this set up. So first things first, there are nuclear bombs now. Good to know.

631
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:16,920
Second things first, go to the trader. Third thing is second, sell the items that I want to get rid

632
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:33,539
of. Always pick up the items that I know I need that I want. And that includes rags, wood, battery,

633
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:59,909
magazine, mushroom, medium caliber bullet. Right? That's for the rifle. Right? He shakes his head.

634
02:10:59,909 --> 02:11:05,590
Why not? Oh, because he wants something in return. These things are worth a lot of money.

635
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:12,420
I don't know. Should I give you an odd stone? These do anything? Don't ignore Jerma Wu.

636
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:29,750
Well, I'm going to ignore it because I just didn't ignore. All right. So don't give the stone.

637
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:39,930
Guys. Here, you can have a few eggs. No, that's too many eggs. You can have like one here.

638
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:47,210
You know, it's okay. So let's do a little bit of a thing here. Let me go. I'm time for a true,

639
02:11:48,329 --> 02:11:52,090
get rid of the shit that you don't need. This is a closet cleaning stream.

640
02:11:53,930 --> 02:12:16,279
Closet cleaning stream starts now. Cook. Don't touch that. I can't. I mean, I can't believe

641
02:12:16,279 --> 02:12:28,069
because I was under a lot of stress. Gasoline. Fruit on the ground. Where is it? Gasoline.

642
02:12:30,039 --> 02:12:37,479
Gasoline. Backseat the fuck out of me right now. What is this for?

643
02:12:52,949 --> 02:13:21,989
You can eat it for health. Is it? What is this? Let's get some twos. Hey, look at that. That's

644
02:13:21,989 --> 02:13:59,819
pretty good. We might be able to get a yahtzee. Get some. You know what you're like going to go

645
02:13:59,819 --> 02:14:08,039
back in time and stop your past self from doing something. I'm going to go back and just be like,

646
02:14:08,039 --> 02:14:21,720
don't do that. Do not howl ever again. All right. So jars of meat. You did it three times.

647
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:30,619
Yeah. Okay. So I'm me now is going to go back in time to tell me from like three months ago to

648
02:14:30,619 --> 02:14:35,340
don't howl. Don't do it. This is why I use the time machine. I've done it three times today.

649
02:14:38,949 --> 02:14:48,739
What? I have a shiny stone. All right. Let me, let me first of all, military flashlight is going to

650
02:14:48,739 --> 02:14:58,979
replace regular flashlight. I think maybe I need to get these scissors for whatever they are.

651
02:15:01,109 --> 02:15:10,649
Toy. Oh, okay. Flip. This is where we really just dump everything. I'm like, I'm like 20 minutes

652
02:15:10,649 --> 02:15:22,439
till I'm like 15 to 20 minutes to complete in the game. So toy cell. Okay. Welder.

Sell. Wedding ring. Sell it. Torch. Sell it. Chicken head. Sell it.

02:15:38,600 --> 02:16:02,489
Welder. Sell it. Okay. Dermot, there are two chapters. You're in chapter one.

655
02:16:09,699 --> 02:16:20,229
Acid just got in my eyes. Welder. Welder. Wedding ring. $50. You should play Hitman some more.

656
02:16:21,130 --> 02:16:25,609

657
02:16:25,609 --> 02:16:32,360
gift today of the flying helicopter briefcase on the guy with the, I have seen this. It's a

658
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:37,479
fucking lot of money. That's a hundred dollars now from Phylactery. Holy shit. You're still giving

659
02:16:37,479 --> 02:16:43,260
money. Dev's never intended a player to take this many days. Well, that's funny because

660
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:48,649
I just was curious and looked up how many days typical did people have when they did their first

661
02:16:48,649 --> 02:16:53,370
blind playthrough. And typically speaking, it's like 30 to 40 days is what I've seen.

662
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:58,569
So you just, I just had a legit research project that could back that up. Um, it used to make

663
02:16:58,569 --> 02:17:03,209
about 30 plus days for your first playthroughs, but I've been told I don't appreciate that.

664
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:14,379
By the way, I howl at people that do stuff like that. You don't want the toy, but Phylactery,

665
02:17:14,379 --> 02:17:18,840
thank you so much. Hitman is done though. Unfortunately. Oh, I think I got everything

666
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:24,540
I wanted out of it. It's a fantastic fucking game. I love every second of that game,

667
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:33,110
but I'm not going to be playing Hitman 2 anymore. I've done it all. I'm gonna, okay.

668
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:46,620
So that should be good. Give me your scrap metal. I want to upgrade this axe blade, but can I do

669
02:17:46,620 --> 02:18:02,780
another upgrade here? Impossible. I gotta go back in my inventory. Play Blood Money. Well, I mean,

670
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:08,040
I could play some of the old ones, but not at the moment. Not right now. All right, back down here.

671
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:21,819
The axe. The axe needs axe head and four more scrap to do the big upgrade,

672
02:18:22,459 --> 02:18:25,979
which I think I'll probably be taking that to the end of the game if I were curious.

673
02:18:28,659 --> 02:18:41,610
Shovel. I think it's time for the shovel to leave. I think the shovel, its time is up. It was really

674
02:18:41,610 --> 02:18:51,860
good. It helped. Goodbye shovel. Thank you for everything. Thank you for everything. Um,

675
02:18:51,940 --> 02:19:08,569
making another one of these. Homemade shotgun. Do I have the shotgun? I do. Useless after fire.

676
02:19:08,569 --> 02:19:13,049
I need to use this on something. I don't know what the hell to use it on. All right, so we got,

677
02:19:13,610 --> 02:19:20,739
take the wood out, put the nails back, take the lock picks out, put these shiny stones in. The

678
02:19:20,739 --> 02:19:27,540
bottles do not have a purpose for me anymore. What's the difference between the heel pills

679
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:42,299
and just the regular pills? What do these do? Do these do anything? This is for stamina.

680
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:47,219
Okay, well I'm just gonna, I'm gonna burn through them. Toy, I can't do anything with it yet.

681
02:19:47,219 --> 02:19:51,540
Battery, I can't do anything with it. Is, I feel like battery, I already did what I needed with the

682
02:19:51,540 --> 02:20:00,329
battery. Do I need to keep it? I'm gonna sell the flares. Bottle of gas, which stacks at three.

683
02:20:00,329 --> 02:20:08,489
Unfortunately, yes. Rear view mirror, like these things, they're not, they don't have a purpose

684
02:20:08,489 --> 02:20:24,819
anymore. And these are heels. So I'll take a couple of these, one of these with me. Okay,

685
02:20:24,899 --> 02:20:32,790
stacks of two, bring the clip with me, put the rope back here. I have, where's my hunting rifle?

686
02:20:32,790 --> 02:20:47,219
The new one, where is it? Where is it? Where's the rifle? Where's the rifle? Where's the rifle? There it

687
02:20:47,219 --> 02:20:53,940
is. Looks like a toothbrush. All right, I'm gonna keep the bullet with the rifle. I'm not gonna use

688
02:20:53,940 --> 02:21:01,479
it yet. I feel like I'm gonna need that end game. Weapons supposed to go up top. Batteries I need

689
02:21:01,479 --> 02:21:08,969
to take for the flashlight. I'll eat the eggs on this trip. I have heels. Bottle, get rid of.

690
02:21:08,969 --> 02:21:15,129
All right, somebody stop me. Somebody stop me right now. What is selling is getting rid of the

691
02:21:15,129 --> 02:21:33,540
mirror. He doesn't want any of it. Okay. I have my axe, 50%. I have a clip. All right, let's go

692
02:21:33,540 --> 02:21:41,239
back down one more time. Let me turn these into wooden planks. Do I have any gas? I might buy

693
02:21:41,239 --> 02:21:45,079
another gas because I'm probably, I'm gonna fill it up. Let's fill it up, the whole thing.

694
02:21:45,879 --> 02:22:01,049
I've got three batteries. Good. Back and I forgot to pee. I had to go really bad. It's okay. I can

695
02:22:01,049 --> 02:22:17,659
wait. All right, let me bring the gas. Go to the bathroom now. I will before I go up for the next

696
02:22:17,659 --> 02:22:41,510
adventure. I'm so sorry I just smashed you in the head. This is, I'm gonna do a full tank in here

697
02:22:41,510 --> 02:22:49,020
and a full tank, fill up the generator over here as well. And then I'm gonna buy a gas can from

698
02:22:49,739 --> 02:23:10,219
Mr. Trader over here. I'm going to cook, right? I am so happy that they decided that this game

699
02:23:10,860 --> 02:23:17,959
was going to not have a time go right now. If the timer was going on right now, this would be

700
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:39,739
horrible. It would be so horrible. Pee? I'll pee like tomorrow. All right, we're good. Let's go

701
02:23:39,739 --> 02:23:46,920
back and put the gas in. He's gonna have to do the ah-ooh during the green screen stream.

702
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:53,000
That is the only other place that I will do it. Because that's not, that, yeah. I'll do, I will do

703
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:00,620
that again. A full, like a full cookie crisp. I promise. And I'm gonna do it as hard as I can.

704
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:24,459
All right, how much is this? 68. I'll just buy one. Take these bottles. All right, back to what I was

705
02:24:24,459 --> 02:24:30,760
just doing. Don't give us this kind of power. Well, those of you that were not here the last

706
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:40,899
time I did this, how that stream works and how that this whole thing is gonna work is I, you

707
02:24:40,899 --> 02:24:45,700
are going to put, if you want to participate, you're gonna put suggestions on what you want

708
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:53,879
me to do in front of a full, like 100, like 50 foot long and like 100 foot tall green screen.

709
02:24:55,459 --> 02:25:01,399
Anything. It could be anything. So when people are talking about doing a woo in front of the

710
02:25:01,399 --> 02:25:06,600
greens, we're like, that's what they're referring to. And then everybody makes this shit. They spend,

711
02:25:07,719 --> 02:25:14,760
why am I here? They spend a bunch of time and a bunch of talent. Very talented people in this

712
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:26,200
community make very, very interesting things from those green screen clips. All right, what was I

713
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:35,350
doing here? Right. Wood. I got this 10. Okay. I got to organize for a second. Scrap metal can go back.

714
02:25:36,149 --> 02:25:43,819
Hills are going to stay here. I'm going to eat these. This is for health. Battery. I don't,

715
02:25:43,819 --> 02:25:53,909
like, don't know what the fuck to do with this stuff. I already have three. Lockpicks. All right,

716
02:25:53,909 --> 02:25:59,909
I think my inventory is good to go. I'm going to do this just so my brain understands, right? I

717
02:25:59,909 --> 02:26:05,430
need my brain to know what this shit is here for, right? So it's going to be whatever is in the slot.

718
02:26:05,430 --> 02:26:11,450
That row is going to be related to that. So for instance, acts first row, we've got,

719
02:26:12,329 --> 02:26:17,610
I don't know, lockpick and watch because that's like you've stuck your hold and it's on your hands.

720
02:26:18,780 --> 02:26:31,700
Battery and don't matter. It could be anything. Battery and meat. Gun. I guess

721
02:26:32,659 --> 02:26:39,370
uh, that system doesn't work. So I'm just going to, who cares? All right, I'm ready.

722
02:26:41,319 --> 02:26:49,500
I need four more scrap. Make sure I get some. I'm ready to go. The thing I'm going to do now is

723
02:26:49,500 --> 02:27:01,420
I'm going to go from here. I have to go to this train wreck. Wake up now. I'll be all right. The

724
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:05,739
pill in the hot bar. You know, that's what I should die. That's what I'm glad to have you guys around

725
02:27:06,379 --> 02:27:12,940
because that just frees up space and that's a heal. That's a stamina. I'm just, this is why,

726
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:17,180
this is why I make sure that I have like some fucking smart people around me surrounded by them.

727
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:24,059
I mean, like you're not surrounding me. There's a ton of you are just like locked in a cube right

728
02:27:24,059 --> 02:27:32,709
here and I can just look over there. So I'm not technically not surrounded. All right, time. I

729
02:27:32,709 --> 02:31:27,319
gotta pee. I will do that. I'll be right back. Hey, how are you? Good to be back. All right.

730
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:31,979
Hey, German cube genius here. Be sure to regularly check your...

731
02:31:33,100 --> 02:32:07,049
Is that the new Bane? All right, I'm ready to go. No, I said, oh, like I hit my hand. How bright is

732
02:32:07,049 --> 02:32:15,719
this? Oh shit, that's awesome. All right, I'm ready. Expedition East. We're going to the train wreck

733
02:32:19,290 --> 02:32:30,700
and here we go. Collecting things along the way. Not rocks because they don't, I hate them.

734
02:32:33,930 --> 02:32:40,149
Is this the same shit that I wore last time? No, this is like purple v-neck. I didn't wear this.

735
02:32:40,149 --> 02:32:50,739
I, no. Holy shit, this flashlight is amazing. Why did I not take this? All right, train wreck.

736
02:32:51,459 --> 02:33:08,329
Don't want to use it too often though. All right, be ready. What have we got? Hunter's house. All

737
02:33:08,329 --> 02:33:34,299
right, that's a big gun. What the hell was that? Got to check it out, you know.

738
02:33:40,620 --> 02:34:17,290
Best item in the whole fucking game. Fair trap. Anybody in here? Yeah, there is. One of those

739
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:37,190
things. I'm going to make them block up the trap. Fuck it. Fuck it. No, no, no, no. Fuck it. Fuck

740
02:34:37,190 --> 02:34:44,200
it. Fuck it. Watch this. No, fuck it. Does this blow up in your hand? Does this blow up in your

741
02:34:44,200 --> 02:34:58,790
hand? Does this blow up in your hand? Does this blow up in your hand? Oh shit, I'm on fire. I'm

742
02:34:58,790 --> 02:35:15,340
on fire. How do I take the fire off? How do I take the fire off? Eat the pills quick. No, I just

743
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:24,139
watched Ryan look at what it does and how long it's on for. Oh, I hate it. Why did I do this?

744
02:35:25,180 --> 02:35:49,159
Turns out that was a terrible idea. Now, I wanted to see like if it stayed, how long it stayed on

745
02:35:49,159 --> 02:35:54,809
you for. And while I'm doing that, I'm like moving this way. Oh, for the love of God. Hopefully,

746
02:35:54,809 --> 02:36:19,750
there's not two of those in here. There probably is. I hear like gurgling sounds. Stuffed links.

747
02:36:20,790 --> 02:36:32,969
Can't wait. What? There's nothing here. Don't, please don't pop up. I got an important message.

748
02:36:32,969 --> 02:36:43,909
Please read. Neck. Hey, let's see me at 35. I don't know why he would like read that.

749
02:36:44,549 --> 02:37:08,069
I whip out the gun for this because these guys suck. Trophy. Oh shit, found a trophy.

750
02:37:15,700 --> 02:37:35,690
Holy shit, he's alive still. Okay, take the gun out. I didn't know. I didn't know. What's this?

751
02:37:35,690 --> 02:37:48,469
A photo of a dog eating something in a magazine. I can't really use the axe anymore. One more hit

752
02:37:48,469 --> 02:38:03,420
of the axe and it's gonna be destroyed. Start using moisturizer. I, I do every single day.

753
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:19,989
I'm not gonna read any more of those. Something is still like clicking and clacking.

754
02:38:20,629 --> 02:38:41,700
Oh, I can make armor again. Wait, let me see. Let me change what I got on.

755
02:38:43,030 --> 02:38:53,770
Uh, forget about, who cares about the wire. I can make armor. The tube. Like, no, it's fine.

756
02:38:53,770 --> 02:39:03,180
It's all right. All right. Anything else back here? No. I think I've looted this whole house.

757
02:39:03,979 --> 02:39:12,260
There's a place to go to the right. But have I gone over here? Let me just check this. I have,

758
02:39:12,260 --> 02:39:18,649
I don't know. I have not gone this way and this is blocked. I can't move it so I have to go up

759
02:39:18,649 --> 02:39:34,469
and around. But there's plaques. What the hell is making, there's a lot of traps in here.

760
02:39:34,549 --> 02:39:50,440
What is making that noise? What the fuck? There's so many traps right here. Wow. No room in inventory.

761
02:39:50,440 --> 02:40:06,010
Well, that has to change. Get rid of the, oh, the nails, the wood. Search the traps.

762
02:40:14,379 --> 02:40:39,180
This is everything I wanted. I'm getting rid of the eggs. Eggs and alcohol. Eggs and nails.

763
02:40:39,659 --> 02:40:55,899
I'm so glad I came in here. This is the exact thing I needed. A bunch of scrap and traps.

764
02:40:55,899 --> 02:41:04,170
Bunch of scrap and traps. Is it all in good fun? I hope he doesn't take it to heart.

765
02:41:04,969 --> 02:41:10,729
No, no. I'm just fucking around. We're just, we're just messing around. That's what we do here.

766
02:41:14,979 --> 02:41:30,489
He's sad. What? Now we're not messing around. That's how you get me. That's interesting.

767
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:51,659
Another wedding ring. I don't want this. It's not worth taking. 50 bucks versus 225.

768
02:41:52,620 --> 02:42:00,889
There's nothing here I want to get rid of. Somebody remember that's here.

769
02:42:02,659 --> 02:42:25,479
Hello. Somebody in this, this bunker thing over here? What about like under? Is somebody like in

770
02:42:25,479 --> 02:42:44,329
a basement or something? I don't see any way to get under. Can I go around? No. Somebody's under

771
02:42:44,329 --> 02:43:11,000
here. Check the tub. After this I have to go home. But somebody's clearly clawing at something.

772
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:31,180
Like right here? What is over here? Is it just Creaky House and the Creaky House makes Creaky

773
02:43:31,180 --> 02:43:40,100
House noises? I mean this, look at this, but there's something in here. All right, I'm going

774
02:43:40,100 --> 02:43:58,459
back. I don't know. If I miss it, I miss it. I do have enough scrap. All right, we're just going

775
02:43:58,459 --> 02:44:10,940
to go to the left. We'll go there tomorrow. It's time to eat pills to run. Watch out for the

776
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:28,360
mushrooms. Straight across. Mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms, no mushrooms. We're good.

777
02:44:29,159 --> 02:44:42,170
A few hours to get settled. That's the logs if I need them. There's a lot of logs right outside

778
02:44:42,170 --> 02:45:07,540
of my house here. So let's go down from the house. Fortify. Let's go cook quick. Shit,

779
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:28,040
I barricaded that. You idiot. Don't, there's no traps in here, right? Okay. One, two, bang, bang,

780
02:45:28,040 --> 02:45:39,159
bang, bang, bang. Almost there. So close. This needs to be changed. This is still secure.

781
02:45:39,959 --> 02:45:44,489
There's a trap still up here. I got to go to the workshop quickly before it gets too late.

782
02:45:46,870 --> 02:45:53,450
And I'm going to do, first of all, we're going to upgrade the axe to be sturdy blade,

783
02:45:53,450 --> 02:45:57,290
greatly increased weapon durability. That's the axe head and a bunch of scrap.

784
02:45:57,290 --> 02:46:09,979
Make it beautiful. I can also do attacks use less stamina. I'm going to do that too. I do

785
02:46:09,979 --> 02:46:21,190
need to prepare it. I'm going to do that first. Okay. Upgrade light materials, use less stamina

786
02:46:21,190 --> 02:46:31,459
for attacks. Do that too. This thing is now a powerhouse. What? Oh, so I'm going to get a full

787
02:46:31,459 --> 02:46:44,500
Todd Howard. Damn. But can you do a full Todd Howard with juke one, juke two or juke three,

788
02:46:44,500 --> 02:46:51,159
juke four? That's going to be tricky. All right. Back here. Let's do, I need to make bear trap.

789
02:46:55,639 --> 02:47:07,780
Hot bar upgrade. Good. Light armor. I need two rags. I don't think I have any access to rags

790
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:21,399
right now, but get this tape in here. I still have a magazine. I got nails. Okay. I'll figure

791
02:47:21,399 --> 02:47:28,020
this out tomorrow and we'll go back out. We do need a full inventory rearrangement. Take this

792
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:37,989
for a heal. I'll take them both. Alcohol, magazine, toolbox, pills. I don't really need them.

793
02:47:38,629 --> 02:47:51,530
Flashlight axe gun, board, shell. I'll take, I'll keep one meat in here. So I have, how many do I

794
02:47:51,530 --> 02:48:06,059
got? Looks good. I'm ready. Let's prepare. I need to board up a window. So let's take that and let's

795
02:48:06,059 --> 02:48:22,299
take like 20, 30 nails. Right. Okay. I have to do some more boarding. I have the traps with me.

796
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:30,100
Turn on the generator before it gets too late, which is all the way out here.

797
02:48:30,819 --> 02:48:50,659
Yeah. I'll do the traps last. Boink. Okay. There's a trap still up here. This is boarded. It's got

798
02:48:50,659 --> 02:49:03,290
full health. I just have to worry about the door. In fact, you know what? Like I should really just

799
02:49:03,290 --> 02:49:10,700
do this to all the fucking doors and windows, shouldn't I? But it's too late. This is good.

800
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:31,000
All right. Get this shit over here. Oh, come on. I don't have time for this shit. Like get out.

801
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:38,379
Let's go. Whatever. It's, that's fine. And then this, this is actually all right too. I don't

802
02:49:38,379 --> 02:49:54,090
mind this. I don't mind this at all. All right. Trap going down. This shit's going down right there.

803
02:49:54,899 --> 02:50:15,659
No. Yeah. Like right there. I trapped myself. Not yet. Because I'm going to do this. Something gets

804
02:50:15,659 --> 02:50:37,340
stuck there. I'm just going to move this and smash it. Don't move. By the way, I got the rare one.

805
02:50:38,059 --> 02:50:51,930
Do you guys know these are rare? Did you know these are rare? I got a legendary cup. That's right.

806
02:50:51,930 --> 02:51:05,159
Fucking raise a death at her. This glued on piece of shit. I need a new mouse.

807
02:51:05,719 --> 02:51:24,280
Do you have to ask if somebody knows if something's rare? Get an Amazon basic mouse.

808
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:33,770
You better believe it. Okay. Here we go. In fact, I'm not going to mess around at all.

809
02:51:34,649 --> 02:51:39,690
Let's just go ahead and do this now because I know you're going to get in here.

810
02:51:53,459 --> 02:52:36,629
Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Okay. Here it comes. No, that door still exists.

811
02:52:56,709 --> 02:53:30,059
Why did the dog not get in the trap when it came in the door?

812
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:49,700
Why did it not trigger the trap? He just got in and just just appeared over here.

813
02:53:50,340 --> 02:54:29,989
Does dying at the house even matter? Yes, because you don't get the money. Unfortunately,

814
02:54:29,989 --> 02:54:43,379
you don't get the money. I would have had it too. It's just I, my thought process there was he was

815
02:54:43,379 --> 02:54:49,139
just breaking through the he broke through the barricade. That's fine. But when he was breaking

816
02:54:49,139 --> 02:54:54,260
through the door, I just figured I don't want to replace that door. So why not just open the door

817
02:54:54,260 --> 02:55:00,760
and let him walk in the trap. I opened the door, it got stuck on the fucking bureau. And then he

818
02:55:00,760 --> 02:55:06,120
teleported to the other side of the screen. And then I got in the trap. I got wily coyote,

819
02:55:07,909 --> 02:55:22,389
like the roadrunner type shit. This happened. And then the game like just made him go here.

820
02:55:22,389 --> 02:55:40,040
Whatever. I got a goal. And I'm like, I have all my stuff on me. So I can just go. He jumped

821
02:55:40,040 --> 02:55:44,360
through the door. Well, I opened the door because I was trying to save time and not have to redo a

822
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:57,879
doorway. All right, don't matter. No, not sell this stuff. I want to I will actually I'm going

823
02:55:57,879 --> 02:56:04,729
to level up here. All right. All the necessary things that I want from you. Didn't even get a

824
02:56:04,729 --> 02:56:10,600
chance to use my axe. I didn't get to swing it once. I'm going to buy another medium caliber

825
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:19,270
bullet, a couple of rags. And that should be all right. No, I'm not going to buy the red egg.

826
02:56:20,229 --> 02:56:33,639
Oh, I do want a magazine though. Very nice. Spin. Now that was only that was only that was the deal

827
02:56:33,639 --> 02:56:51,979
for when I got that's not every trap. 4200. Here we go. Do I get to pick another one? Okay,

828
02:56:51,979 --> 02:56:59,510
I can pick appetite. I would be able to restore my health by eating wood. I mean, that's that's

829
02:56:59,510 --> 02:57:08,100
good. I'm going to do that. Like, that's just good. The trap. Once a day, you won't trigger a trap.

830
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:14,569
I know this is so much for me. It's so much more useful. But still, eating the wood thing is just

831
02:57:14,569 --> 02:57:22,889
health forever. No, eat the wood. It's health forever. I can eat. I never have to worry about

832
02:57:22,889 --> 02:57:49,479
health stuff. Where are we? Every time you... Okay, this is me, I think. Turn off the light.

833
02:57:51,799 --> 02:58:08,700
Well, I don't know. I want to sleep. All right, fine. I don't want to go out yet. I need to wake

834
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:18,229
up first. I don't want to wake. This is breakfast breakfast and egg stream. It's too early to cook.

835
02:58:18,950 --> 02:58:22,229
I don't want to go outside. It's too early to cook. I need to wake up first. All right,

836
02:58:22,229 --> 02:58:29,399
we'll go take a shower. Sweater and clothes. All right, put on the sweater. Put on the clothes.

837
02:58:32,950 --> 02:58:43,049
I'll run myself a bath. Franny of washing machine. I spent two days in the queue to get it.

838
02:58:43,770 --> 02:59:18,870
I'll run myself a bath. Oh. Don't wake up and step in the trap. Oh, that would have been so

839
02:59:18,870 --> 02:59:30,540
horrible. That would not have even been my fault. And you all know it. All right, it's back to

840
02:59:30,540 --> 02:59:49,020
storage. And then I'm going for the train. Make another bear trap for later. Okay. Light armor.

841
02:59:49,020 --> 03:00:00,979
Let's do it. Bingo. Batteries. Magazines. Traps. Put them away. Put the wood away. Put the nails

842
03:00:00,979 --> 03:00:07,370
away. Keep the pills. Pills can sit out here. That's fine. Put the scrap away and put the

843
03:00:07,370 --> 03:00:13,290
bullet away as well. I got two hunting rifle. I'm going to hold on to it for an emergency scenario.

844
03:00:13,290 --> 03:00:31,129
I'm ready. Let's go. I'm out the door. Need to go to the train wreck. Wood for health.

845
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:41,559
That's true. The generator is just blaring. Turn generator off the generator. What about the

846
03:00:41,559 --> 03:00:53,750
generator? I know. And is it any wood or it could be wood planks? Like, can I just take like three

847
03:00:53,750 --> 03:01:03,780
or four wooden planks with me? Does that like work? Try a different room this next night.

848
03:01:04,940 --> 03:01:07,500
Yeah, I might. I might come back out to the hallway strat.

849
03:01:11,239 --> 03:01:21,350
Um, all right. Can I eat? Just, just, can I just bear wood? I can. All right. I'm just gonna bring

850
03:01:21,350 --> 03:01:39,500
five. All right. That's fine. Cool. And we're out. Bare ass. Over here. Let's check it out.

851
03:01:40,059 --> 03:01:58,100
If we come across any other bullshit, I have an upgraded axe. The thing is meaty. I can swing it

852
03:01:58,100 --> 03:02:03,379
a bunch of times. Don't have to worry about it breaking. We're at the hunter's house. We've

853
03:02:03,379 --> 03:02:13,430
already went in here. Uh, I'm going to take some pills because I want to be able to run

854
03:02:13,430 --> 03:02:29,239
for a little while. Straight over here. Location found? Question mark. Is that a camp? I don't

855
03:02:29,239 --> 03:02:54,260
understand. Why is this a question mark? I like, but to be fair, like this, it's it's the same

856
03:02:54,260 --> 03:03:00,260
color as the ground. It's, it's easy to miss because look at all these rocks. These are,

857
03:03:00,260 --> 03:03:04,020
it's the same thing, but they're not rocks. They're whatever. You get it.

858
03:03:05,379 --> 03:03:56,280
I'm not the only one. It's a train. What's up? What's up? Give me those shrooms.

859
03:04:03,319 --> 03:04:44,860
Train. What's up with the train? All right. Just checking the perimeter. There is something.

860
03:04:52,700 --> 03:05:09,909
Get all the stuff. Okay. Cool. Got everything. Now what the hell is, what do I do with this train?

861
03:05:21,350 --> 03:05:38,950
Can I go in here? So why is this such a big point of interest?

862
03:05:39,670 --> 03:05:59,690
I thought it was like, go to the train. There's a train. What do you mean use my mouse?

863
03:06:10,979 --> 03:06:29,379
Like that's a door, but I, how do I get to, how do I open it? That's a, that's a door. This looks

864
03:06:29,379 --> 03:06:40,469
like it. This is, this is the door. Okay. Um, right. What was the code? Note with the code.

865
03:06:41,430 --> 03:06:44,629
Found some code in the dark times. I don't know what it's for, but I hope it opens that door.

866
03:06:45,510 --> 03:07:19,180
So what the hell? 8909. What, what are you doing here? Photo. Okay. And alcohol. Don't

867
03:07:19,180 --> 03:07:31,020
come near me. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. The doctor is lying against the train car's wall.

868
03:07:31,020 --> 03:07:40,409
His face is covered in sweat. An intense odor of alcohol hangs in the air. Don't come any closer.

869
03:07:40,409 --> 03:07:45,129
You rotten dog. I won't give you the key. Can't you understand? I saved your life.

870
03:07:46,069 --> 03:07:50,870
You run away. That's clearing. If it wasn't for me, you owe me for fuck's sake.

871
03:07:50,870 --> 03:07:55,399
The doctor moves closer to the wall, grotesquely kicking his legs against the floor.

872
03:07:56,809 --> 03:08:01,049
You think I don't know who you are? Rack. I've managed to get a good look at you.

873
03:08:02,139 --> 03:08:07,180
Your kind visits us whenever you please. You hide behind the trees, you watch us from a distance,

874
03:08:07,180 --> 03:08:13,260
and then you disappear. You have no idea how it is to live here. This place, these words, everything

875
03:08:13,260 --> 03:08:18,500
is fucked up here. I won't take it anymore, do you understand? I won't bear a look at those

876
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:25,159
deformed, reeking bodies anymore. I know the cries of those wretched villagers. First they begged for

877
03:08:25,159 --> 03:08:30,100
help, now I need to hide from them? I've just snored every doctor. How the fuck was I supposed

878
03:08:30,100 --> 03:08:37,379
to help them? His face goes silent. Now hugging the wall of the train car, he looks truly pathetic.

879
03:08:37,379 --> 03:08:47,049
Can you hear it? It's the walls. They speak to me. My little girl is calling me. I know she's

880
03:08:47,049 --> 03:08:59,299
waiting for me. I must come back to her. She's so close. I want to go back home. Please. This key

881
03:08:59,299 --> 03:09:34,579
is my only chance. Help me escape this place. Help me or kill me. To the underground entrance.

882
03:09:34,579 --> 03:09:49,260
That's the guy from the start of the game. This is that bastard. Kill him. This is not a decision

883
03:09:49,260 --> 03:10:44,280
I can make. We'll save him. Choose wisely. Let's go. What are we doing to this guy? Pretty unanimous

884
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:51,860
to save him. Kill then save him. Kill him and then be like, all right, I guess I'll, I guess I'll

885
03:10:51,860 --> 03:10:56,889
let you know where it is. Yeah, kill him and then show him on the map where to get out. You know,

886
03:10:56,889 --> 03:11:01,290
like stick the axe in his chest and then show him the map and go, this is how you get out.

887
03:11:03,850 --> 03:11:15,000
No! And it's his last thing he sees. All right, we're saving him. Thanks for voting. Show the

888
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:18,920
underground entrance on the map. I take out the map and show the doctor the location of the abandoned

889
03:11:18,920 --> 03:11:23,959
house with the hidden underground entrance. The doctor stares at the map for a long while without

890
03:11:23,959 --> 03:11:29,399
lifting his gaze to meet me. Thank you. He removes his dirty glasses with a trembling hand and freezes.

891
03:11:29,959 --> 03:11:34,729
I will wait for you there and better take the essential things with you.

892
03:11:35,370 --> 03:11:58,040
Looks like returning here will be impossible. Found the doctor. Where are we going? Found the

893
03:11:58,040 --> 03:12:02,600
doctor. I've agreed to help him escape the woods. We are to meet by the door inside the underground

894
03:12:02,600 --> 03:12:23,620
passage. The village? Oh, there, underground entrance. Oh, right, that, with the key and the

895
03:12:23,620 --> 03:12:30,659
21 at the beginning of the game. Right, okay. How did I get there before? So I gotta go all the

896
03:12:30,659 --> 03:12:42,069
way back here. Oh, that's not, that sucks. Okay. Well, doctor, I'll see you at the ex. It's getting

897
03:12:42,069 --> 03:12:58,899
late, so it's time to get the heck out of here. It's noon. I could go through here. I'll go through

898
03:12:58,899 --> 03:13:05,959
here and send my stuff here. That's an easier place to hold. Let me see if I can do that.

899
03:13:10,649 --> 03:13:20,440
Noon is late for boomers. I need to take drugs, like, seriously. Give it a rest. Come on, man.

900
03:13:20,440 --> 03:14:00,579
Let's go. Can I go down? Leave me alone. A natural wall. Burned house. What? Oh, fuck.

901
03:14:01,379 --> 03:14:29,159
Where is this thing? Why does it have to be these, like, giant logs everywhere? Down all the way

902
03:14:29,159 --> 03:14:39,209
around. I've walked by it. What? I, I know, it's right here, but I can't, how do I get around this

903
03:14:39,209 --> 03:14:52,629
shit? Down here? Yeah, all right, there's, there's one spot, there's one parking space worth of space

904
03:14:52,629 --> 03:15:40,379
for me to go through the unnatural wall. I don't like this vision shit. Key to the burned house.

905
03:15:41,340 --> 03:17:03,370
I need a key. I just got it. There's shit over there. Okay. It didn't do anything. Oh, there's

906
03:17:03,370 --> 03:17:18,760
no chests here. It was a lie. Just checking around the whole house. Relax. I'm just checking around

907
03:17:18,760 --> 03:17:39,530
the whole house. Relax. Relax, Jeremy. I'm sorry. Don't relax. No, I'm just saying that out loud.

908
03:17:54,540 --> 03:18:12,020
Made it. Look at that. Shortcut to this old house. All right. Dry meadow. Here we are.

909
03:18:20,200 --> 03:18:27,819
Oh, hell yeah. I remember this place. This is my first house. Does my stove still work?

910
03:18:27,819 --> 03:18:47,700
Oh, you better believe it does. Light the oven. Ten essence. What is this bullshit? All right.

911
03:18:47,700 --> 03:19:19,180
We're good. Um, I have to survive in here. Does this place have gas? What about a container? Do

912
03:19:19,180 --> 03:19:33,079
I have anything for the container? All right, this has got plenty of gas. I don't even need

913
03:19:33,079 --> 03:19:40,120
to fill it. All right, but I do need to, I do need to fill the thing to make some boards and try to

914
03:19:40,120 --> 03:19:47,659
board up a couple of windows here. I have to live here. Are you guys cheating? Wait, is everybody

915
03:19:47,659 --> 03:20:02,969
cheating right now? Why do I know that? Should I know that? Or are you just cheating? It was

916
03:20:02,969 --> 03:20:25,959
under the thing. This is cheating. You guys just cheated. Exploding barrels? This is, I, this is

917
03:20:25,959 --> 03:20:35,260
cheating. I have an exploding barrel. All right, wait a minute. We saw that code already. All right,

918
03:20:35,260 --> 03:21:04,250
I believe you. I believe you this once. Exploding barrel. Okay, I'm gonna have to check that. I'm

919
03:21:04,250 --> 03:21:15,049
gonna have to set that up tonight. That's cool. All right, let's store some of this shit. I need

920
03:21:15,049 --> 03:21:22,139
to keep the wood out. I still have plenty of, put the fabric away. Keep the, let's do a bear trap

921
03:21:25,829 --> 03:21:30,389
and then single shot pistol. Who cares? Fire it once and just throw it away.

922
03:21:31,110 --> 03:21:36,010
Knife is going to be for an emergency scenario. Or actually, I don't need the, that's okay.

923
03:21:36,979 --> 03:21:42,469
I have heel, exploding barrel. Let's put the exploding barrel up. Nails, I need that to

924
03:21:42,469 --> 03:21:49,530
board up some stuff. Let's do that right now. This is boarded. This is boarded. This is going

925
03:21:49,530 --> 03:22:02,219
to be boarded as well. This is a great place to do this. I need, I need that light. Turn the

926
03:22:02,219 --> 03:22:26,489
generator on. Turn on the gas. Yeah, so that will come in handy here. There's only one.

927
03:22:27,129 --> 03:22:45,780
Fuck did I say? It's like smashed my face against the door. There's only one lamp in here. All right,

928
03:22:45,780 --> 03:22:59,879
this is not going to happen. Like why, why can I not have a level up scenario where we're staying

929
03:22:59,879 --> 03:23:25,100
here? This is perfect. This is amazing. Holy shit. This is the best room in the whole game.

930
03:23:28,069 --> 03:23:36,309
Oh, barrel. Um, let's put the exploding barrel. Um, no, not yet. This is a cool item. I'm going

931
03:23:36,309 --> 03:23:58,489
to save it. Let's go. Don't let that lightly go. It's, uh, I know you're right. It's like too late

932
03:23:58,489 --> 03:24:02,170
to move this shit. I wish I could like activate a thing that made it so I could move stuff

933
03:24:03,500 --> 03:24:09,860
not like a toddler. You put me on the back of this thing to move it. And if I need to move it,

934
03:24:09,860 --> 03:24:14,100
if you know, I don't care about scratching the floor. I'm going to sprint and fucking be able

935
03:24:14,100 --> 03:24:26,729
to move this thing 100 miles per hour. The only reason why people move furniture like that is

936
03:24:26,729 --> 03:25:13,209
because they're concerned about scratching their floors. All right, hang on. Here we go. This is

937
03:25:13,209 --> 03:25:32,860
where we lose. Is he going to cry? You drinking lemon juice is my secret slime. Don't forget your

938
03:25:32,860 --> 03:25:46,870
rifle at the other base. Oh, I won't. I plan on actually on going back up there. In fact,

939
03:25:46,870 --> 03:25:54,620
no, just use the axe. Take the bell. Oh yeah, there's a bunch of stuff. I need to,

940
03:25:55,659 --> 03:26:01,450
there's a bunch of shit up there. I don't have the bell down here. I can't ring it.

941
03:26:02,250 --> 03:26:29,059
There's a light of flare. Okay. I mean, it's just sitting there.

942
03:26:31,909 --> 03:26:41,909
Best emote coming through the room. I've done a pretty good job of sitting still

943
03:26:51,829 --> 03:27:14,200
and I'm going to scrap all these traps. Somebody running around outside over here. Can you hear it?

944
03:27:19,260 --> 03:27:26,889
Wait, this is the part. Doesn't one of these like spawn something.

945
03:27:27,450 --> 03:27:37,450
I got plenty of room to move around here though. So I should be fine.

946
03:27:45,879 --> 03:27:50,500
And I got the axe. Best melee weapon in the game. So don't worry. I'll be good.

947
03:27:51,299 --> 03:28:03,139
The bell's not going to work in chapter two. Well, whatever.

948
03:28:31,079 --> 03:28:46,040
God, this is so much better than the other place. Angel, angel thumb. Not yet. Not yet. Two more

949
03:28:46,040 --> 03:29:41,450
hours. Shit can go horribly wrong at seven 30. There you are. There you are. All right.

950
03:29:41,450 --> 03:30:03,899
Let's break them down. All right. Move. Dismantle.

951
03:30:20,500 --> 03:30:23,459
Revealing his chest covered in horrid growths.

952
03:30:24,180 --> 03:30:31,079
It is fused with a porous helmet pulsating to the rhythm of his breath. I'm starting to feel dizzy.

953
03:30:31,079 --> 03:30:35,020
Although loosening his grip, the man raises his left arm, bringing his forearm to my face

954
03:30:36,440 --> 03:30:46,979
and forces a dab out of me. It's pale as paper and reads. Okay. Do not open the door. Let's stick

955
03:30:46,979 --> 03:31:14,229
together. Do not open the door. Medium caliber. I don't have any junk for you.

956
03:31:15,350 --> 03:31:30,760
I have here that I don't care about. I eat this wood though.

957
03:31:32,899 --> 03:31:40,149
Just hold on. I will store some of this stuff. Don't leave the trader. Well, eventually I have

958
03:31:40,149 --> 03:31:53,110
to. I can't just. I'm going to save this scrap. I might need it eventually. I'll sell the fabric.

959
03:31:53,750 --> 03:32:09,940
Let's store the bear. I don't know. Single shot pistol. I don't need. What the hell am I going

960
03:32:09,940 --> 03:32:24,700
to do with that right now? Nails. Boards. Just give me a second. Mushroom. Scrap. Magazine.

961
03:32:24,700 --> 03:32:31,739
Medium caliber bullet. Okay. That's what I want. And then you can take. Just take this meat. I'm

962
03:32:31,739 --> 03:32:48,459
not going to use it. Yes, I will. Can I upgrade my hot bar again? Or is it over?

963
03:32:48,459 --> 03:32:58,649
I can't craft any more. I can't craft any more of this. So it's going into the trash. I'm just

964
03:32:58,649 --> 03:33:28,899
going to sell it. Weird Jupiter. All right. I have to go back to the other hideout and get

965
03:33:28,899 --> 03:33:43,590
myself ready for the final boss. Hook this. Keep the scrap. Take the rags too. And the nails.

966
03:33:44,549 --> 03:33:51,180
Yeah. And the gas. Replace the gas with this three wood. Who gives a shit. All right.

967
03:33:52,299 --> 03:34:00,569
Here we go. Cook that thing. It's funny. Essence. Boy, what a waste of money.

968
03:34:02,139 --> 03:34:10,489
All right. This is the part. I'm going to go back up to the old spot. Which is here. Get everything

969
03:34:10,489 --> 03:34:18,680
I want. Meet the guy down here. Sounds like a plan. And I have to. I'm probably going to have

970
03:34:18,680 --> 03:34:22,920
to last one more night in the. I'm going to try to. No, I'm going to try to go up, get everything

971
03:34:22,920 --> 03:34:30,969
I want, come down, last a night, go over here. That's the plan. I'm out. Let's go. Make it quick.

972
03:34:36,420 --> 03:35:33,670
Straight up. I'm coming back down here. So I want this to be full of gas. Let's go. At least one

973
03:35:33,670 --> 03:35:50,889
more night over there. Any, any drugs? If I have them, take them. Food, drugs. No, let's go. Hurry

974
03:35:50,889 --> 03:36:15,850
up. Food and drugs. That's all you need. In this game. Not actually. I need to go up through this

975
03:36:15,850 --> 03:36:22,969
little, this little hut, right? Sit over here. There. Where the car is. All right. Making good time.

976
03:36:23,850 --> 03:36:39,659
The house. And then it's just up into the left. Oh my God. Jeremy.

977
03:36:39,739 --> 03:37:10,760
Hey. No woods. Okay. Almost there. Hasn't even been two hours. We're good.

978
03:37:27,879 --> 03:37:50,889
What the fuck did I just double take it? I'm here. Let's go. All right. Who's walking?

979
03:37:50,889 --> 03:38:31,129
Who's walking? Stop walking. Okay. Good. Let's do it. The traps in here. How did the dog get in this

980
03:38:31,129 --> 03:38:59,750
is what I want to know. How did the dog get in here? All right. Let's go. I need my important

981
03:38:59,750 --> 03:39:19,770
shit. Ah, there's so many things that could be important in here. Rifle. Rifle ammo. Magazine.

982
03:39:19,770 --> 03:39:48,309
Healing shit. Um, should I make my armor put it on? Why does the game do that to me? All right. The

983
03:39:48,309 --> 03:39:57,540
bell. Does the bell work? I don't think, does the bell actually work? All right. I get a gun.

984
03:39:58,600 --> 03:40:13,959
Batteries. Big flashlight. Heals. More heals. Take out the important shit. Bring the, do I have

985
03:40:13,959 --> 03:40:30,260
alcohol out here? Put the trap away. I'm going to, no, this is not important. Two clips. Five

986
03:40:30,260 --> 03:40:35,780
batteries. The watch. I can only, I'm only taking things if they're in like at least a stack of

987
03:40:35,780 --> 03:40:42,020
three. You fucking stupid ass thing. Like I'm in the menu. What the hell do you think I'm trying

988
03:40:42,020 --> 03:40:53,579
to put it? Now where the fuck did it go? Okay. Three, three. Get the rope out of here. Scrap is

989
03:40:53,579 --> 03:41:06,569
probably going to be important. Take the scrap. Only a stack of two though. Put the weapons up

990
03:41:06,569 --> 03:41:20,420
here. What time is it? Okay. Good time. We're hunting rifle. Block picks. Bell. Battery flashlight.

991
03:41:22,139 --> 03:41:36,969
Alcohol. No. Watch. Scrap. Nails. Maybe some wood. Wood. Yeah. And how many nails do I have?

992
03:41:36,969 --> 03:41:48,940
Take 50 nails. 20 wood. Don't take the bell. All right. Bell is staying. Maybe more wood just so I

993
03:41:48,940 --> 03:42:00,969
can make sure I can get, what about maybe gas? Some gas. Gasoline. This looks all right. Scrap.

994
03:42:00,969 --> 03:42:15,299
Gas. Shovel. Rifle ammo. Rifle ammo is up here. No knife. Give her the knife. Exploding

995
03:42:15,299 --> 03:42:25,690
barrel is a funny laugh out loud moment, but of course it has to stay. Gun. Light. Melee.

996
03:42:26,329 --> 03:42:55,819
Ranged. Healing. Gun. Okay. Rifle ammo. Magazine. That? Okay. Shovel. I think that's good. I think

997
03:42:55,819 --> 03:43:09,239
we're good. Full tank of gas. Armor. Heals. Heals. Heals. Batteries. Flashlight. Gun. Magazines for

998
03:43:09,239 --> 03:43:23,959
gun. Hunting rifle. Medium caliber bullet. Nothing else is standing out to me here.

999
03:43:23,959 --> 03:43:45,110
Do I actually need this shovel? This is already upgraded. I have to leave. Repair it. That takes

1000
03:43:45,110 --> 03:43:58,540
too much scrap. I'm gonna need that scrap for something else. I'm out. I'm out. Ditch the

1001
03:43:58,540 --> 03:44:25,180
barrel. No I can't. I have to take it. Let's go. Back down. All right. I'm ready to take on whatever

1002
03:44:25,180 --> 03:44:33,579
is gonna be taken on at this like end game stage here. I'm not stepping in any more fucking poison.

1003
03:44:41,930 --> 03:45:24,760
Beautiful. I'll take the extra scrap. Why not? Oh you dick. Hurry up. Why do you exist?

1004
03:45:35,670 --> 03:45:43,180
Why can't I just walk down? Why can't I walk down? Why do you have to have this gigantic

1005
03:45:43,819 --> 03:46:48,040
wall of thing? Oh my god. It's a sneeze. That was a sneeze. I have to go through the house.

1006
03:46:54,170 --> 03:47:14,379
Fuck you. Fuck you. Seriously. You can't have like two. What's this music playing for?

1007
03:47:14,940 --> 03:47:53,319
Was that a sound clip from the movies? He's like a half-life scientist getting hurt.

1008
03:47:57,799 --> 03:48:15,139
Jesus christ. Okay. Fuck. All right. Let's live another day in here.

1009
03:48:24,219 --> 03:48:28,540
What do I got? I want to. After this day is over I'm gonna repair everything.

1010
03:48:29,579 --> 03:48:33,899
We're just gonna exist in here and I'm just gonna kill everything that comes in.

1011
03:48:34,700 --> 03:48:41,399
I'm gonna just attack it. It's going to be killed. There's enough gas to last one more night.

1012
03:48:42,950 --> 03:48:54,739
Anybody that comes in here is going to be killed. And this is right there but it's not it's night

1013
03:48:54,739 --> 03:49:09,510
time. I could just go right here and meet the doctor but it's 17 o'clock. Should I just do this?

1014
03:49:09,510 --> 03:49:14,549
Do I have time to get over there? I need to repair my shit. Wait wait wait wait. No. Do I?

1015
03:49:14,549 --> 03:49:30,100
No. Let's go. Hold on. Let me repair my shit. Okay. I'm going. All right doctor. The doctor's

1016
03:49:30,100 --> 03:49:35,670
gonna explode. He's gonna turn into a giant monster. Do I have time? Let's go. I better find it.

1017
03:49:39,139 --> 03:49:41,940
Already. Did I use the runner already? I did. I don't have any drugs.

1018
03:49:52,889 --> 03:50:07,909
Oh I hope I. Yeah. Here it is. Made it. All right. Where's the doctor? I should take everything I

1019
03:50:07,909 --> 03:50:20,069
need with me. Coming back may prove impossible. Way ahead of you. Way ahead of you. Do I have

1020
03:50:20,069 --> 03:50:48,469
everything I need? Yes. Do I? Oh shit. I have to do this. Backpack. How would the doctor do

1021
03:50:48,469 --> 03:51:22,889
this by himself? There's no way he would. What's up? Are we going? Locked. It's my only way out.

1022
03:51:22,889 --> 03:51:26,889
I won't be able to open it without my key. Ask the doctor to use the key. Look at the handle.

1023
03:51:27,930 --> 03:51:37,860
Hey you open this in case something's back here. That's bad. That's funny. Hey you do it. Look

1024
03:51:37,860 --> 03:52:25,930
through the keyhole. Is somebody standing there? All right doctor. You go first. I think someone's

1025
03:52:25,930 --> 03:52:43,479
still moving there under the rubble. Man. I stumbled upon something amongst the rubble.

1026
03:52:44,600 --> 03:52:51,770
Strange soft item. The tunnel has collapsed recently. The reinforced steel protruding from

1027
03:52:51,770 --> 03:52:56,969
the debris has not been covered with rust yet. When I gaze into the tunnel I notice a silhouette

1028
03:52:56,969 --> 03:53:02,170
of a man on the ground. Suddenly the man snaps to life as if woken from a deep slumber.

1029
03:53:03,420 --> 03:53:09,770
Who goes there? I hear a faint, unnaturally distorted male voice. Are you one of them?

1030
03:53:10,489 --> 03:53:16,489
The man attempts to get up but fails. I can see him desperately flailing his limbs around. It's

1031
03:53:17,049 --> 03:53:23,430
as if his back has been glued to the ground. No please. As I approach him he shuffles his legs

1032
03:53:23,430 --> 03:53:28,389
nervously as if trying to retreat into the collapsed tunnel. I didn't do anything. I beg

1033
03:53:28,389 --> 03:53:34,459
you. I just wanted to pass to get back to my family. The tree is blocked. The only way out.

1034
03:53:34,459 --> 03:53:39,690
The only path home. A huge talking tree. I begged it to let me pass but it wouldn't listen.

1035
03:53:40,489 --> 03:53:46,700
I could not understand what it was saying to me so it came here. The man props himself up on his

1036
03:53:46,700 --> 03:53:51,909
elbows with a huge effort. He tries to straighten his body but something is firmly holding him by

1037
03:53:51,909 --> 03:53:59,110
the back and the neck. I can't. I can't do it. I can't get up. The man drops into the rubble

1038
03:53:59,110 --> 03:54:05,590
then goes silent. He clenches his fist. My head hurts. The man places his hand on his forehead

1039
03:54:05,590 --> 03:54:14,280
and feels a strange dent above his left brow. He breezes. What? What is this? He carefully inserts

1040
03:54:14,280 --> 03:54:22,629
his index finger into the hole. His eyelid twitches. My stone. I hear a sound as if an

1041
03:54:22,629 --> 03:54:28,389
eggshell cracking. The forehead bends under his hand. The stranger pushes another finger into the

1042
03:54:28,389 --> 03:54:38,709
hole. A thick goose pews from the wound. I can hear his skull cracking. My little stone. The man

1043
03:54:38,709 --> 03:54:43,750
slowly removes his fingers from the hole in his head. A colorless ooze dripping from them.

1044
03:54:44,389 --> 03:54:52,149
He's holding something. A round object. That's why. He swings his left hand and throws the object

1045
03:54:52,149 --> 03:55:00,120
at me. A small irregular ball bounces off my arm and lands at my feet. Looks like a bullet but it's

1046
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:15,000
soft. Okay. This this is what put me to sleep. His head lifelessly drops to the concrete floor

1047
03:55:15,000 --> 03:55:24,889
of the destroyed tunnel and goes still. Suddenly I can hear the bang of the metal door followed by

1048
03:55:24,889 --> 03:55:44,649
the sound of fading footsteps. It's the doctor. What do you mean it's the doctor? A big sign on the door

1049
03:55:44,649 --> 03:56:10,659
reads closed ahead. Where's the doctor? Where'd you go? Oh yuck. I just wanted to pass. Return to my

1050
03:56:10,659 --> 03:56:44,469
family. I think I got this military flashlight. Oh shit that's a lizard. Where is it? Where is it?

1051
03:56:44,469 --> 03:57:19,479
Where is it? Roats? Some strange organic growths. What the hell are you? Eyes? Soft organism growing

1052
03:57:19,479 --> 03:57:53,940
out of the ground. Oh shiny. A shiny stone tied to a wooden cross. You're playing a challenging and

1053
03:57:53,940 --> 03:57:57,219
unforgiving game. You will not be led by the hand. Respect the woods. Be patient and focus.

1054
03:58:06,620 --> 03:58:30,090
Still on first island. Tutorial complete. Where'd the doctor go? Chapter two. How long is chapter

1055
03:58:30,090 --> 03:58:56,340
two? The swamp. It's twice as long. It's 10 hours? Oh shit. Broken compressor. A damaged compressor

1056
03:58:56,340 --> 03:59:03,819
used to refill oxygen tanks. I should be able to fix it. I don't have that thing. Oh fuck there's

1057
03:59:03,819 --> 03:59:09,899
like a whole area. All right let's go. There's only two chapters right?

1058
03:59:16,600 --> 03:59:23,399
Rusty oxygen tanks. Rusty oxygen tanks. They're useless. Generator. Well here's the house. Good

1059
03:59:23,399 --> 03:59:52,809
thing I brought the gas. Dumped the whole thing. That's why I brought it. All right is there a

1060
03:59:52,809 --> 04:00:06,389
stove in here? Gas tank. Hitting the tank will release the gas under high pressure. Note day one

1061
04:00:06,389 --> 04:00:12,950
the compressor is broken. So is the lock on the trap door leading to the underground? Had to use

1062
04:00:12,950 --> 04:00:21,110
a blow torch. Fucking moisture. We took photos of the tree from observation point in the vicinity of

1063
04:00:21,110 --> 04:00:31,780
3C. It grew twice its size in a month. Really quick even for a local standard. Okay. 1520 hours. I'm

1064
04:00:31,780 --> 04:00:36,260
slowly running out of oxygen. I've sent two men to search for nearby junkyard. Maybe we won't have

1065
04:00:36,260 --> 04:00:42,389
to go back for spare parts for the compressor. Watch out for the cottage near the junkyard

1066
04:00:42,389 --> 04:00:51,079
marked building on the map. Someone could be living there. At least 10 locals lurking between

1067
04:00:51,079 --> 04:00:55,559
the trees. How do they know about us? We won't be able to gather our equipment in time. The risk of

1068
04:00:55,559 --> 04:01:20,409
getting detected is too high. You need to evac. What the hell? There's a stove. Radio. It's covered

1069
04:01:20,409 --> 04:01:23,850
in a thick layer of dust. Looks like no one's used it for a long time but it still smells of warm

1070
04:01:23,850 --> 04:01:34,329
plastic and burnt wires. Okay. I gotta get this place ready. Where's the workbench? New house.

1071
04:01:38,139 --> 04:01:58,389
Stop doing that. Can I throw like a grenade down here? All right. This is a bigger house. What's

1072
04:01:58,389 --> 04:02:04,950
up here? Hey, what's that? A crate covered in a strange organic black shell. I won't be able

1073
04:02:04,950 --> 04:02:11,540
to open it until I get rid of the substance. I can only decipher individual words. Shell,

1074
04:02:11,540 --> 04:02:50,729
thick glue, light. Fuck out of here. Where's the workbench? This place is enormous.

1075
04:02:52,420 --> 04:03:03,450
This looks like a good spot to hide. Yeah, this is definitely the spot. Here it is. I need a key.

1076
04:03:04,920 --> 04:03:19,079
No. What? Where's the workbench? Is there no workbench? It's right there. All right. Hold on.

1077
04:03:19,079 --> 04:03:31,000
This is where I need to store some shit. Battery. Put the shovel away. Actually,

1078
04:03:31,000 --> 04:03:33,719
I'm gonna need all this because I'm gonna board up the doors and everything. All right. Scrap

1079
04:03:33,719 --> 04:03:40,340
can go in here. Nails can go in here. This drug can go in here. All right. I'm gonna actually

1080
04:03:40,340 --> 04:03:43,379
keep the nails because I'm gonna have to start boarding stuff up and figure out what I want to

1081
04:03:43,379 --> 04:04:00,440
do. Wardrobe. Okay. So we've got light. Door. Window. Window. Window. Opening. Opening. I think

1082
04:04:00,520 --> 04:04:09,770
it's potentially here in the workroom. Window. Window. Open the gook. Hold on.

1083
04:04:16,149 --> 04:04:22,299
This might be not a bad place to do it either. Like through here. All right. Let me go to that

1084
04:04:22,299 --> 04:04:46,540
crate. Nothing even in here. All right. I need to prepare the compressor. I have a cottage near

1085
04:04:46,540 --> 04:04:56,040
the junkyard. Village. These are marked on the map now. All right. Where do I want to go? Maybe

1086
04:04:56,040 --> 04:05:05,829
here. This is not terrible. There's a door. There's already a barricaded window. People can get

1087
04:05:05,829 --> 04:05:16,840
through this though, I think. I don't know. Or in here. I would say down there is probably the

1088
04:05:16,840 --> 04:05:30,149
safest. Let's go ahead and start that process. This is not bad either. It's it's in here. This

1089
04:05:30,149 --> 04:05:42,969
is the one. This is the one. Okay. So looks like the only real reason to come through here.

1090
04:05:43,690 --> 04:05:47,690
I'm gonna board this up. This can be there. That's fine. Let me just take a look outside.

1091
04:05:49,659 --> 04:05:57,430
Exploding barrel. Oh my god. I have a bunch of these. Oh I feel like this is gonna get hard or

1092
04:05:57,430 --> 04:06:02,540
something. This is where it gets hard, right? This is where this is where it gets very hard.

1093
04:06:13,899 --> 04:06:20,579
All right. So let me check down here. Let me make sure it doubles. I hate when that fucking thing

1094
04:06:20,579 --> 04:06:27,620
does that. This is not ideal. Actually it's not that bad though. I have to just pick one. I have

1095
04:06:27,620 --> 04:06:38,500
to pick one. The workbench room is good but it's too small. This is too small. Too small. I don't

1096
04:06:38,500 --> 04:06:52,469
like it. Too small. We're going up here. This is the one. This one's a little bit bigger. This one's

1097
04:06:52,469 --> 04:07:02,379
already barricaded. Let's do this one. And there's already a lamp in here too. We can board this but

1098
04:07:02,379 --> 04:07:14,100
not yet. I could even board this. They can only come in from one way. Let's bring this up here.

1099
04:07:14,100 --> 04:07:26,739
I went to the store and came back. Is he still? Is he still dying to bear? Is it time to save bear

1100
04:07:26,739 --> 04:07:41,190
traps? And exploding barrel right here. Let's do it. Exploding barrel right here. I'm gonna wait

1101
04:07:41,190 --> 04:08:02,540
for someone to come in. Boom. Good night. Okay. What's going on? It's raining. All right. Wardrobe.

1102
04:08:02,540 --> 04:08:08,950
We got matches. Rag. Where's the generator? I gotta keep burning that into my mind. Up, right,

1103
04:08:10,090 --> 04:08:21,899
down. We got gas. We can come through here though. Pick up the gas tank. No.

1104
04:08:22,780 --> 04:08:32,100
Make some traps. Let's make a few traps. Yeah this is where I wouldn't like being in here.

1105
04:08:32,659 --> 04:08:42,790
So that's how you get the generator on. This is a long way to go except for right there. But it's

1106
04:08:42,790 --> 04:08:47,899
all right. I'll explode these motherfuckers when they come in the door. Or like you know that's a

1107
04:08:48,780 --> 04:08:52,540
yep that's no it's not that's a dad that's that's a that's a dead end that's a bad strategy

1108
04:09:03,059 --> 04:09:26,170
all right bear traps let's go i gotta i keep getting new places bear traps make two or three

1109
04:09:26,170 --> 04:09:44,459
though looking good pull them out let's go this is the final new place that's true

1110
04:09:45,340 --> 04:10:05,610
got plenty of gas stop with that board it up board it up bear trap here this is a good place

1111
04:10:05,610 --> 04:10:10,489
for it to be couldn't i could not ask for a better place to have it because then i really

1112
04:10:10,489 --> 04:10:17,049
only have to worry about this side over here and some random psycho that just like comes in the room

1113
04:10:30,440 --> 04:10:37,610
that's secure that's secure this is not secure but it's about to be because i want to show you

1114
04:10:39,500 --> 04:11:07,190
oh i do it check this out i'm gonna put a bear trap here and if i hear that get activated oh i

1115
04:11:07,190 --> 04:11:34,420
open the door and blast although i can't leave if i do this so that's the plan that's the plan

1116
04:11:40,309 --> 04:11:49,500
put the gun back here flashlight back here i'm gonna keep that in my inventory heels can stay

1117
04:11:49,500 --> 04:11:52,700
now i'm gonna go store this stuff because everything's been boarded i just need how

1118
04:11:52,700 --> 04:12:01,350
many do you need to board what is it it's uh three and seven so i need three six nine wood

1119
04:12:02,149 --> 04:12:26,899
and then 21 nine and 21 because in case these break so stick that i need nine of these

1120
04:12:28,020 --> 04:12:37,989
it was a really stupid way to do that but whatever all right nine of these put the barrels back

1121
04:12:38,950 --> 04:12:49,510
clips can stay and i need 21 of these okay don't need matches i might hold on to one of these just

1122
04:12:49,510 --> 04:12:55,209
to do it here's the heel and i also have bandages i'm gonna store these

1123
04:12:56,569 --> 04:13:09,340
store the flare battery's fine 921 a panic scenario might be all right all right we're good we're

1124
04:13:09,340 --> 04:13:24,540
good okay i have a plan i have a plan there's one of these down here too actually i'm gonna keep that

1125
04:13:26,459 --> 04:13:29,819
this is bait because when this turns on it's gonna be flashing through the window

1126
04:13:30,540 --> 04:13:40,379
this is gonna attract so many people into this room i think that's not a bad call

1127
04:13:41,020 --> 04:14:02,780
i don't want it all right is it it's almost time thank you for coming through this door

1128
04:14:03,899 --> 04:14:23,260
because um i wouldn't have known it existed here we go i'm gonna turn on the generator

1129
04:14:23,899 --> 04:14:31,719
just wait i don't want to waste that much gas surround yourself with explosive barrels and

1130
04:14:31,719 --> 04:14:39,739
traps and just let the monsters come at you go out in a blaze of glory you don't get debated here

1131
04:14:39,739 --> 04:14:47,370
i won't but what's gonna happen is when i i'm gonna keep this door open when i hear the first like

1132
04:14:49,049 --> 04:14:54,360
i'm gonna just open the door make sure i can how big of an explosion radius is this

1133
04:14:55,079 --> 04:15:16,790
can somebody help me out here is a huge i'm gonna get this in the corner so if i have this here i'm

1134
04:15:16,790 --> 04:15:20,969
gonna make sure i can open the door all right so let's do like a little rehearsal here

1135
04:15:22,729 --> 04:15:38,229
what's that somebody right there boom because the traps are gonna be right here all right time

1136
04:15:38,229 --> 04:15:54,680
turn generator on let's do it i got time i got time i got time i got time i got time to do it i

1137
04:15:54,680 --> 04:16:06,459
got time to do it up there to block the light fuck you i almost it's turned out to be four i found

1138
04:16:06,459 --> 04:16:14,149
new signs 17 kilometers west of the hideout 33 points 12 circles cataloged pattern unattentive

1139
04:16:14,149 --> 04:16:27,420
simple scribblings and a madman three shotgun shells okay get this why is this chair here get

1140
04:16:27,420 --> 04:17:14,020
out of the way got it good okay pull this back here so i can still open trap put it down let's

1141
04:17:14,020 --> 04:17:30,440
go this is gonna move in the corner 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 coming up 20 come up 20 coming up 20

1142
04:17:30,440 --> 04:17:44,389
coming up don't move okay i'm ready remember trap outside we hear it open the door boom

04:17:44,629 --> 04:18:11,319
i'm not moving move the chair what do you mean move the chair i can't i can't move anything guys

1144
04:18:17,110 --> 04:19:20,540

1145
04:19:35,799 --> 04:19:38,360
the reason why i would i don't want to move the chair is because it's gonna make noise

1146
04:19:39,239 --> 04:19:57,540
all right hold on i can still see out of my prep what are you doing

1147
04:19:59,540 --> 04:20:20,329
why is this stuff moving why is this stuff moving fuck no my trap my plan you've ruined my plan

1148
04:20:24,329 --> 04:20:45,750
don't move it's bait to get you to scream so they can know where you are it's just a dog

1149
04:20:47,510 --> 04:20:58,520
you're not gonna get in no you won't get in you got that and you have the door to do as well

1150
04:20:59,239 --> 04:21:07,850
by the way if you do get in i'll get you uh cazzie thanks for the five community subs cazzie

1151
04:21:13,049 --> 04:21:20,489
five drop there all right i gotta be ready this dog is not going to go into the trap

1152
04:21:21,129 --> 04:21:33,909
it will if i go like this though oh shit oh what the fuck there's an area in the room

1153
04:21:33,909 --> 04:21:44,870
oh the dog didn't even get trapped

1154
04:21:46,309 --> 04:22:36,329
does the eye see me don't get comfortable yet that was horrible

1155
04:23:15,079 --> 04:23:19,479
here's how that happened well first of all it shouldn't happen but the reason is because

1156
04:23:20,520 --> 04:23:24,840
you can see this object that's movable this object that all the objects in the room

1157
04:23:24,840 --> 04:23:31,319
and that one's not here but the other ones are and it's the only thing that doesn't show up

1158
04:23:32,040 --> 04:23:46,700
and i just whatever that's still a good strategy and i'm gonna do it again well maybe it's not i'm

1159
04:23:46,700 --> 04:23:55,500
just gonna keep you know you know fuck that i'm gonna keep this door open because when an alien

1160
04:23:55,500 --> 04:24:02,459
like that comes in the room i need a way to okay i'm gonna put a trap like here and like run through

1161
04:24:02,459 --> 04:24:13,299
this door and like bait him into the trap i'm not just gonna stand in a cube this is the thing

1162
04:24:13,299 --> 04:24:16,579
that needs to be boarded this is the thing that needs to be protected and if somebody comes in

1163
04:24:16,579 --> 04:24:45,059
you bait him around the trap anyways i where's the trader usually they're right here no trader

1164
04:24:45,620 --> 04:25:13,000
didn't you say i had a reputation with the trader the three it's fucking pinwheel three visitors

1165
04:25:13,000 --> 04:25:18,280
stare at me in silence as i'm waiting for my move i can only hear the heavy breathing of the

1166
04:25:18,280 --> 04:25:23,639
tallest figure holding a giant bag as he opens a bag the room is filled with an intense smell of

1167
04:25:23,639 --> 04:25:43,659
mushrooms apparently they wish to give me something well you're very loud whatever you are let's go

1196
04:32:08,329 --> 04:32:12,969
were growing back right in front of my eyes i was afraid i would get stuck between trunks

1197
04:32:14,329 --> 04:32:18,489
losing that sow made their blood run cold they escaped fearing starvation

1198
04:32:19,450 --> 04:32:26,569
it pops the cigarette out of the frying pan and into the fire they have a camp in the old quarry

1199
04:32:26,569 --> 04:32:34,760
in the southeastern edge of the swamp thanks i used to come here to treat people i pulled out kids

1200
04:32:35,399 --> 04:32:41,799
milk teeth delivered babies and then came to diseases i've never even heard of i was the only

1201
04:32:41,799 --> 04:32:49,930
doctor in the area he cut us off from the outside world first you then the woods no help from anyone

1202
04:32:49,930 --> 04:32:54,489

1203
04:32:56,920 --> 04:33:01,319
i'm gonna kill him it just didn't fit okay so he was curious uh the doctor looks around it's

1204

1207
04:33:50,099 --> 04:34:02,040

1208
04:34:02,040 --> 04:34:07,400
underwater den in the western edge of the swamp okay i have no idea where it leads i'm a shitty

1209
04:34:07,400 --> 04:34:12,119
diver i've seen similar one in the northeastern edge of the swamp too we just got all kinds of

1210
04:34:12,119 --> 04:34:16,360
information to give me an info dump on me i've realized something that came to me when we were

1211
04:34:16,360 --> 04:34:20,759
walking through the tunnels oh you mean when you were running from me from the tunnels and

1212
04:34:21,240 --> 04:34:24,200
two heads are better than one i could have handed you like a rifle

1213
04:34:26,540 --> 04:34:33,450
idiot you're like a disease you and your kind the doctor takes a step back as if he was afraid

1214
04:34:33,450 --> 04:34:40,790
of me at the same time a sinister smile appears on his face you don't belong to this land you

1215
04:34:40,790 --> 04:34:47,430
weren't here when the forest was born you're a splinter a foreign body a vagabond and then

1216
04:34:47,430 --> 04:34:52,869
the forest and everything else here these are the antibodies even the morons from the village

1217
04:34:53,590 --> 04:34:58,389
raging white blood cells and an infected bloodstream that's the reason we hide from us

1218
04:34:59,930 --> 04:35:03,849
doctor is visibly pleased with himself in his theory his hands are no longer trembling

1219
04:35:03,849 --> 04:35:13,319
he produces a hand-rolled cigarette and lights it logical isn't it this sucks

1220
04:35:15,880 --> 04:35:25,340
taking every bone in my body to not just attack but anyways um stuff marked on the

1221
04:35:25,900 --> 04:35:51,959
the peak something must have scared them off from the huge tree shrine

1222
04:35:53,400 --> 04:36:00,580
the figure of the shrine bears the signs of teeth it's partially eaten i mean i eat wood

1223

1253
04:42:00,970 --> 04:42:05,450
both hands almost falling off from the chair he grabs onto my sleeve i feel all his weight

1254

1256
04:42:21,979 --> 04:42:30,020

1257
04:42:30,580 --> 04:42:37,340
i've had a lot of time to think for fuck's sake his eyes widen his pupils are milky white i can

1258
04:42:37,340 --> 04:42:44,950
feel him climbing my coat you need to find a basement jesse's basement i remember it

1259
04:42:45,830 --> 04:42:53,029
it's right next to the tree the tree is too large so if you can't reach it from the top you've got

1260
04:42:53,029 --> 04:43:00,520
to try from the bottom find the basement and there surely you'll find the tree's roots the bloody

1261
04:43:00,520 --> 04:43:06,919
thing must have roots that's where they are destroy them hold them drag them twist the fuck out of

1262
04:43:06,919 --> 04:43:14,279
them you'll find a way i know you will the old man slides down my coat straight onto his destroyed

1263
04:43:14,279 --> 04:43:21,430
wheelchair for a moment he searches for his stone which he uses to prop himself up against the muddy

1264
04:43:21,430 --> 04:43:30,360
floor of the barn thank you thank you uh what's road the old man grabs the photo feels it and

1265
04:43:30,360 --> 04:43:35,799
then takes out a small glass object from his pocket and puts it to his eye the road home

1266
04:43:35,799 --> 04:43:44,099
what a load of bullshit the road of madness is what it is no one lives around her anymore

1267
04:43:44,099 --> 04:43:49,779
everyone is dead only sometimes sometimes i hear footsteps they wake me up at night

1268
04:43:52,330 --> 04:43:58,569
sound of bare feet against the floor and bells of sort they come out of nowhere they move towards

1269
04:43:58,569 --> 04:44:02,729
the trees then come back they pass me and fall silent they're like a nightmare a bloody nightmare

1270
04:44:03,689 --> 04:44:09,750
if you come across some wheels two little wheels so that i could fix my chair maybe

1271
04:44:09,750 --> 04:44:18,060
you'd benefit from it as well two wheels i had tires years ago when my eyes were good

1272
04:44:18,060 --> 04:44:23,419
people used to pass through here they would leave their huts and go there where that damn

1273
04:44:23,419 --> 04:44:29,799
tree grows they would often leave at night so that no one could see them they went into the

1274
04:44:29,799 --> 04:44:36,520
deep dark woods and never came back some of them would say they are going home but most of them

1275
04:44:36,520 --> 04:44:43,000
were silent i don't know the land has changed those trees have cut us off from the rest of the world

1276
04:44:43,880 --> 04:44:49,540
but home for me has always been here and that monstrous morning abomination grew out of the

1277
04:44:49,540 --> 04:44:54,259
ground it blocked the passage and that that no one has managed to pass through since then

1278
04:44:55,380 --> 04:45:00,020
maybe people found some other place maybe they died at the swamp just like us

1279
04:45:00,979 --> 04:45:10,790
what are you going on about again the wheelchair oh the war took me legs then those wankers burned

1280
04:45:10,790 --> 04:45:18,900
my house and me pigs but it was years after the war they said it was to fight the disease so they

1281
04:45:18,900 --> 04:45:25,459
said and my zocker the disease took her from me all i have is this wheelchair and this land

1282
04:45:26,020 --> 04:45:35,139
used to be different here first the woods changed trees start sprouting up everywhere we got caught

1283
04:45:36,020 --> 04:45:44,630
in a water flood in our fields people went crazy out of hunger they fall out of food they don't

1284
04:45:44,630 --> 04:45:56,500
they don't eat those what about what about their legs so destroy the tree i'll handle this grandpa

1285
04:45:57,220 --> 04:46:57,880
you got any stuff forks sickle this area is huge here's the tree destroy the tree all right i'll

1286
04:46:57,880 --> 04:47:28,860
take care can i get in here basement hatch oh fuck this is like a side quest the hatch leading to

1287
04:47:28,860 --> 04:47:32,220
the basement is blocked from the inside the marks on it suggests someone tried to break it open

1288
04:47:32,779 --> 04:48:13,020
how the fuck do i get in here is there any other way to go over here the tree is gigantic its bark

1289
04:48:13,020 --> 04:48:20,139
stays in constant motion it swells up and collapses into itself as if breathing i see human

1290
04:48:20,139 --> 04:48:24,380
silhouettes growing out of the tree trunk they're also moving as if gesturing in slow motion

1291
04:48:25,500 --> 04:48:32,950
dozens of miles repeat their lines simultaneously creating a uniform noisy murmur between the bows

1292
04:48:33,029 --> 04:48:38,229
i catch a man's gaze it's fixed on me his body similarly to the other beings

1293
04:48:39,029 --> 04:48:44,389
seems to form an integral part of the tree his limbs are gnarled and his face is grotesquely

1294
04:48:44,389 --> 04:48:49,509
deformed he's the only one to acknowledge my presence his hand slowly raises pointing to

1295
04:48:49,509 --> 04:48:55,610
something on the horizon above the roofs of the destroyed village the man's lips are moving but

1296
04:48:55,610 --> 04:49:02,680
the ghastly murmur of the other voices drowns out his words kick the tree hoping that the voice will

1297
04:49:02,680 --> 04:49:09,080
go silent try to climb the tree look at the lips of the person talking to me

1298
04:49:10,279 --> 04:49:14,919
even though the figure speaks sluggishly it is too high for me to read the lips properly

1299
04:49:15,639 --> 04:49:23,580
i think one of the words is radio the bark is slimy and soft its creases move away from my

1300
04:49:23,580 --> 04:49:28,380
shoes and hands i feel the arms that protrude from the roots tugging at my clothes i'm not sure if

1301
04:49:28,380 --> 04:49:33,500
they want to drag me down or pull me closer i barely break free from their grasp climbing

1302
04:49:33,500 --> 04:49:39,959
up is out of the question kick the tree i kicked the tree trunk with all my strength breaking a

1303
04:49:39,959 --> 04:49:46,040
branch sticking out from between the roots it hurts i hear a silent voice coming from beneath

1304
04:49:46,040 --> 04:49:52,119
my feet it's a face of a man who's grown into the root he's completely covered in bark his

1305
04:49:52,119 --> 04:49:58,040
lips barely stick above the mud and his raised arms resemble branches one of them is broken

1306
04:49:58,040 --> 04:50:02,360
in the elbow the stump leads a white gooey substance instead of seeping down it slowly

1307
04:50:02,360 --> 04:50:16,090
flows upward forming a new arm so just like a soul tree examine i notice a little smiling

1308
04:50:16,090 --> 04:50:20,650
face of a girl gazing at me from behind a cluster of sleeping heads oblivious to the chaos around

1309
04:50:20,650 --> 04:50:26,250
her she studies me with curiosity just next to her a massive man calmly humps a melody the lullaby

1310
04:50:26,250 --> 04:50:33,400
drowns in the overwhelming noise surrounding the tree i'm barely able to make out any conversations

1311
04:50:33,400 --> 04:50:39,849
and squabbles from the horrible noise of the tree boughs you took everything from us the shouts

1312
04:50:39,930 --> 04:50:44,490
come from an old man only the tip of his head and one of his arms stick out from between the

1313
04:50:44,490 --> 04:50:51,459
tightly crowded bodies you stole it thieves may the dogs piss on your faces right next to

1314
04:50:51,459 --> 04:50:58,200
him a woman's head wobbling from side to side repeats we were hungry we were hungry another

1315
04:50:58,200 --> 04:51:03,639
figure hiding its face under an enormous root lets out a chilling shriek quiet fucking quiet

1316
04:51:03,639 --> 04:51:10,380
leave us in peace shut up he is interrupted by a man next to him his intestines hanging up from

1317
04:51:10,380 --> 04:51:17,130
his stomach it was our common good it was meant for all of us you stole it are we going to go

1318
04:51:17,130 --> 04:51:23,770
through every single branch high above there's another guy that says hey fuck you how dare you

1319
04:51:24,409 --> 04:51:29,900
high above the top of the crown two silhouettes hanging from side to side from their hands and

1320
04:51:29,900 --> 04:51:38,700
legs grown to the trunk are trying to bite each other's faces off no it was mine it was mine it

1321
04:51:38,700 --> 04:51:53,580
actually was mine it was me it's me that was me this is you all right is there anything else so

1322
04:51:53,580 --> 04:52:09,459
the tree is made out of people potentially lots of people okay so the real question is

1323
04:52:10,020 --> 04:52:29,610
what the hell do i do now uh it's time to go home i've really collected very much stuff although

1324
04:52:29,610 --> 04:52:41,639
i will get another clip tomorrow hopefully nothing else i got a couple of things burn the tree i mean

1325
04:52:41,639 --> 04:52:45,639
if i can get down there i'm gonna put some gasoline on it and get rid of the damn thing

1326
04:52:45,639 --> 04:53:03,419
okay that's the idea all right i think i've i've got to get back i need okay the shovel

1327
04:53:07,319 --> 04:53:12,119
rubble dig in the rubble okay i can bring the shovel up there wow that's i actually did need

1328
04:53:12,119 --> 04:53:28,889
the shovel okay i don't even think about it that thing is huge i do not want to fuck with that

1329
04:53:28,889 --> 04:53:54,540
thing not at all no thank you no thank you stay in your swamp please i need to get the fuck out

1330
04:53:54,540 --> 04:54:14,229
of here it's like giant maze over here no there's no way anybody saw that like it was parted look

1331
04:54:14,229 --> 04:54:31,909
at this this is like the same exact this is this let's get out here i'm gonna go back to my house

1332
04:54:32,790 --> 04:54:39,299
and then try to find a way to get back into there's a couple of things that they said i want to look

1333
04:54:39,299 --> 04:55:09,930
at the journal the next morning i'll take the bear trap back home hooray let's craft antidote

1334
04:55:09,930 --> 04:55:17,700
not necessary let's get rid of the rest of this gas i'm gonna cook bring out the traps

1335
04:55:18,419 --> 04:55:27,220
explosive barrel and i still have a battery so hold on where's my

1336
04:55:28,259 --> 04:55:43,590
okay so how are we doing make another one use this fill up okay this thing's pretty much empty

1337
04:55:43,590 --> 04:55:48,150
let's take up space bring the shovel back there tomorrow no i want to go check out the thing

1338
04:55:48,709 --> 04:56:00,779
all right i gotta cook first why are there so many bear traps but no let's get the fuck out of me

1339
04:56:00,779 --> 04:56:07,669
again why are there so many bear traps but no bears well because they're not made for bears

1340
04:56:07,669 --> 04:56:29,479
in this game they're married for people well there's the radio remember it was radio radio

1341
04:56:29,479 --> 04:56:51,909
that's a lot of acids ah so close i need ah damn it so that's barricaded that's cooked

1342
04:56:56,139 --> 04:57:02,860
tank is empty let's begin the process of what i wanted to do last time last time

1343
04:57:03,819 --> 04:57:11,159
there's two traps here this needs to be re-barricaded i need three okay i need more

1344
04:57:11,159 --> 04:57:31,060
of that shit of course i do and it's all the way down here three six nine and then i need like

1345
04:57:31,779 --> 04:57:45,619
21 of these just to have an inventory okay and what do i have for heals i'll take these three

1346
04:57:47,700 --> 04:57:51,700
magazines lockpick don't need to be in here now i'm just gonna try to survive i'll make another

1347
04:57:51,700 --> 04:58:04,040
one of these and that can stay here i actually don't need it i have pills okay boarding stuff up

1348
04:58:04,040 --> 04:58:15,860
putting stuff down all right i'm gonna max out my credit card laughing my ass off

1349
04:58:17,659 --> 04:58:28,700
i would advise against doing that something tells me that's probably not a smart idea

1350
04:58:32,740 --> 04:58:46,650
laughing my ass off let's board this up all right this is full health full health

1351
04:58:46,650 --> 04:58:52,279
how is this one doing didn't get touched i'm gonna remember the the idea is i'm gonna keep

1352
04:58:52,279 --> 04:59:01,979
this shit open and i'm gonna board this one up over here that's the idea i have to pee again

1353
04:59:01,979 --> 04:59:10,330
really badly so hopefully this goes well i want to get this here we're gonna put oh god damn it

1354
04:59:10,330 --> 04:59:28,259
it just creeped up on me right here board this one up frequent urination problem well i've drank

1355
04:59:29,139 --> 04:59:43,540
almost two full containers of this so it is a well-oiled machine it's pretty much what i do

1356
04:59:43,540 --> 04:59:49,380
every stream you just don't see it because i don't usually i'm not on camera but this is scary game

1357
04:59:49,380 --> 04:59:59,700
day the last four days in a row have been scary who's like okay i pay attention trap the only way

1358
04:59:59,700 --> 05:00:06,389
they can really get in is through here which let's just put one here i would know no i want

1359
05:00:06,389 --> 05:00:22,840
this here right there because i want to be able to stand behind it let's do another one no i don't

1360
05:00:22,840 --> 05:00:39,880
need to let's get the heel on there so i have i can heal all right i'm ready now if somebody

1361
05:00:39,880 --> 05:00:49,779
chases me i can run up here go around this corner and make them walk into this i might even no not

1362
05:00:49,860 --> 05:00:57,049
to this that's not that that's too much these are good down here this is barricaded here

1363
05:00:57,849 --> 05:01:06,009
the chair is going to move actually just get the damn thing out of the way

1364
05:01:08,069 --> 05:01:11,990
because it's just going to cause a problem when the guy eventually comes through the ground

1365
05:01:11,990 --> 05:01:33,819
we're doing gun here we go what about the centipede man centipede man spawns i'm running into this room

1366
05:01:33,819 --> 05:01:47,240
and baiting him into the trap go pee you'll be fine well that would be bad if i were just to leave

1367
05:01:47,240 --> 05:01:58,680
right now and that trap is not sitting right in front of the door so i should okay we'll see

1368
05:01:59,319 --> 05:02:17,189
well we got three shots in this before i have to reload it is lemon water intentionally you're

1369
05:02:17,189 --> 05:02:25,740
just that bad at making lemonade uh no the lemon water is it's intentional because i'm currently

1370
05:02:25,740 --> 05:02:36,659
on a fodmap diet and i can't have fructose corn syrup i can't have a lot of fruit shit but lemon

1371
05:02:36,659 --> 05:02:42,500
juice lemon juice is fine i can put a little bit in water lime juice and water and it's

1372
05:02:42,500 --> 05:02:47,939
like it's like drinking it's like drinking a soda let me have this okay i know it's not the same

1373
05:02:47,939 --> 05:03:49,900
thing is it a dog if it's dog it's getting the hammer all right why did i move is that making

1374
05:03:49,900 --> 05:04:02,220
noise i think that's loud okay something's coming into the ground i don't know what that is

1375
05:04:18,220 --> 05:05:11,000
what the fuck is that thing i just got dropped on that second that door opens

1376
05:05:11,799 --> 05:05:27,619
who opened the door how did you get in that room

1377
05:06:17,189 --> 05:06:46,389
multi-room strat works same deal putting trap there if i get diarrhea on i can go up here

1378
05:06:46,389 --> 05:06:53,819
anybody chases me i can go up here say vice versa throw go down this is a good spot i think

1379
05:06:53,819 --> 05:07:05,180
i'll be all right so for this day uh i am going to i need to look at the journal for a second

1380
05:07:05,900 --> 05:07:10,220
destroying the top he claims i first need to get the cellar to the cellar located near the tree

1381
05:07:10,220 --> 05:07:15,020
that's how i find its roots which i need to burn according to him it's the only way to get rid of

1382
05:07:15,020 --> 05:07:21,900
the abomination uh and advice from a blind deaf old man with no legs the only lead i have so far

1383
05:07:21,900 --> 05:07:32,680
it's not much but i've grown accustomed to it okay i saw the village that's the village of the tree

1384
05:07:33,720 --> 05:07:39,159
spare parts for the compressor the old journal also included information about a college cottage

1385
05:07:39,159 --> 05:07:44,439
located near the junkyard according to the notes i would be able to find some spare compressor parts

1386
05:07:44,439 --> 05:07:56,389
there they might come in handy broken compressor i'm going up that's all i got right now that's

1387
05:07:56,389 --> 05:08:03,450
literally all i got why no rifle because i'm afraid to use it because it has five shots

1388
05:08:04,250 --> 05:08:08,330
and i'll miss three of them and i'm not going to use it until the credits roll

1389
05:08:08,970 --> 05:08:15,590
because that's what i do in games like this would probably come in handy

1390
05:08:17,540 --> 05:08:30,659
or the shotgun you know what shotgun's coming with us we're gonna give you we'll use it but

1391
05:08:30,659 --> 05:11:19,509
i'm gonna pee because it's time to go to the bathroom i'll be right back hello wait every

1392
05:11:19,509 --> 05:11:26,700
break you gotta apply a little bit more balm what if i just turned the whole thing up like this and

1393
05:11:26,779 --> 05:11:44,840
just bit the top up and swallowed it i don't think this is low fog map slime action okay

1394
05:11:45,880 --> 05:11:51,319
so today we were going to uh this i like the strategy this is good we're gonna go investigate

1395
05:11:51,319 --> 05:12:02,759
cottage upstairs we're going up here cottage near the junkyard that way why does this feel

1396
05:12:02,759 --> 05:12:20,500
strange it's like it feels different is it backwards i was worried okay uh i'm ready to go

1397
05:12:20,500 --> 05:12:23,939
i don't have to do anything i've got heels i've got i'm gonna have to cook this stuff and

1398
05:12:25,380 --> 05:12:33,939
we should be fine i thought i stepped in a trap again i don't want to remove the uh wood here so

1399
05:12:33,939 --> 05:12:39,220
i'm gonna go around this stuff i don't need to dismantle it what's the point of dismantling it

1400
05:12:39,220 --> 05:13:02,740
when i can just go like this and push this back tonight good turn off the generator

1401
05:13:05,419 --> 05:13:16,470
level up we're at probably the final level adrenaline i will deal double damage in melee

1402
05:13:16,470 --> 05:13:24,330
when close to death my vitality will increase once a day i'll be able to become invisible to

1403
05:13:24,330 --> 05:13:31,580
enemies if i stay still healing items will be less effective and my accuracy decreases

1404
05:13:31,580 --> 05:13:45,779
oh no this is okay probably the vitality or invisibility how long does that last

1405
05:13:46,340 --> 05:14:15,240
my accuracy will be less effective in shooting how much more i wonder done so i've got a little bit

1406
05:14:15,240 --> 05:14:25,939
more health there that's pretty good i thought i was really expecting a full cube i don't like

1407
05:14:25,939 --> 05:14:38,419
a half a cube feel a little uh feel a little ripped off all right i haven't even looked in here

1408
05:14:39,459 --> 05:14:47,450
so i need to craft a few things for instance i need to talk to the trader down here

1409
05:14:49,130 --> 05:15:04,040
buy my daily magazine my daily scrap my daily magazine my daily bullet my daily rags and

1410
05:15:04,840 --> 05:15:22,389
that's good i'll do the pills too yeah you can have a sickle my daily vroom

1411
05:15:24,069 --> 05:15:29,189
all right let's get the shot i don't even have a shotgun i've left the shotgun doesn't is not here

1412
05:15:29,189 --> 05:15:45,029
here i don't own a shotgun single shot shotgun where do i get that those pliers i haven't seen

1413
05:15:45,029 --> 05:15:53,020
them at all single shot shotgun so i need i had need the weapon i don't have the weapon parts

1414
05:15:53,020 --> 05:16:20,150
either i'm gonna have to keep this blade is i'll bring the hunting rifle this thing has one shot

1415
05:16:21,029 --> 05:16:24,069
i'm going to take one bullet with me extra

1416
05:16:30,069 --> 05:16:41,500
how many pills do i have three uh i'm gonna bring some wood to eat

1417
05:16:46,470 --> 05:17:01,529
i left at the last island yeah just eat this now it's not a great heal actually it's pretty bad

1418
05:17:02,490 --> 05:17:19,479
that's really bad well unfortunately for me that's gonna have to do

1419
05:17:20,520 --> 05:17:30,659
okay i'm bringing a barrel too yeah and no i'm not going that way yet i'll bring yeah

1420
05:17:31,459 --> 05:17:36,619
just in case of something else lock picks a couple of batteries my watch i don't think

1421
05:17:36,619 --> 05:17:54,299
i need this many magazines but uh yes i do do you ever looks like the guy who gave me the wrong

1422
05:17:54,380 --> 05:18:05,380
order at olive garden i would get your order right every time that looks good i got some

1423
05:18:05,380 --> 05:18:12,580
pills i got pills i've got bread i got i got now guys i've got i've got never-ending garlic bread

1424
05:18:14,919 --> 05:18:38,900
from olive garden we're going up here let's try it see what i can do investigate up here we go whoops

1425
05:18:39,540 --> 05:18:45,099
that's just good stuff i'll take it

1426
05:18:45,580 --> 05:18:58,200
i don't know why i did that just eat some fucking never-ending garlic wood i used it at least i

1427
05:18:58,200 --> 05:19:39,419
used it all right no more wood don't need i don't need to take anymore all right look for a compressor

1428
05:19:39,419 --> 05:19:57,099
thing right that's a hidden bear trap i'll take it starting to run out of space already no no don't

1429
05:19:57,099 --> 05:20:07,029
take the wood i can i can go on like a scavenge if i need to put the wooden

1430
05:20:07,110 --> 05:20:09,830
i can i can go on like a scavenge if i need to put the wooden

1431
05:20:11,590 --> 05:20:27,939
and the mushrooms and shit no no it's not necessary he spits

1432
05:20:34,549 --> 05:21:07,240
die motherfucker i used it it's too hard to see that shit it really is how many bullets does it

1433
05:21:07,240 --> 05:21:16,659
take to kill one of those how i gotta go up really is that that's not even that's out of the bounds

1434
05:21:16,659 --> 05:21:29,689
that's out of the map this accuracy is actually really really starting to be a pain in the ass

1435
05:21:30,330 --> 05:21:43,029
i can scavenge for it another time i oh i'm i'm here now this looks like this is out of balance

1436
05:21:48,810 --> 05:22:19,180
eat a piece of wood what the fuck is that what is that poisoned i ain't fucking with that thing

1437
05:22:19,900 --> 05:22:29,529
just put it on the hot bar i'm gonna be chewing on wood this whole time

1438
05:22:30,330 --> 05:22:45,110
oh i can't do it from the hot bar it's an alien artifact all right there's apparently some

1439
05:22:45,110 --> 05:23:02,630
cottage near a junkyard over here another one of these okay i'm at the sawmill i don't understand

1440
05:23:02,630 --> 05:23:41,610
what i'm supposed to do about those things this map is lying to me right now i got it mushrooms

1441
05:23:42,409 --> 05:23:56,439
i have to watch out for how's the doctor again he looks bad this land hides more secrets than your

1442
05:23:56,439 --> 05:24:02,009
little fucking rat brain is capable of understanding the doctor digs through the mud i think he's

1443
05:24:02,009 --> 05:24:07,540
looking for something deep underground there's a current of electricity fucking electricity

1444
05:24:08,020 --> 05:24:11,619
he starts flailing his arms around wildly throwing pieces of mud everywhere around him

1445
05:24:12,259 --> 05:24:17,529
and it flows underground from tree to tree the doctor suddenly freezes staring at me with his

1446
05:24:17,529 --> 05:24:24,250
arms mid-air and it powers everything it connects it all if i had a light bulb if i just screwed it

1447
05:24:24,250 --> 05:24:29,770
into one of these branches it would light up i bet it fucking would it bends over a small hole

1448
05:24:29,770 --> 05:24:38,549
in the mud and continues digging maybe this is where you're hiding maybe this is the way bolt

1449
05:24:38,549 --> 05:24:54,490
handle should i get the bolt handle or a weapon part i don't know which one to do do the embryo

1450
05:24:54,490 --> 05:25:05,479
instead the bolt handle is a weapon part that's a shitload of bad that's like two thousand three

1451
05:25:05,479 --> 05:25:11,290
thousand essence what whatever i can make with the bolt handle i'll try to make it

1452
05:25:13,380 --> 05:25:19,450
let's go got it can you hear the trees sing they're calling us they're showing us the way

1453
05:25:19,450 --> 05:25:27,580
they're showing us the way all at the same time blocking it i can't understand it he kicks a stone

1454
05:25:27,580 --> 05:25:32,060
are they trying to tell us something are they putting us to a test i don't know maybe they're

1455
05:25:32,060 --> 05:25:41,080
lost too and don't know what to do he shakes his head dispirited and goes silent still got that

1456
05:25:41,080 --> 05:25:45,880
cigarette though after a long pause he turns toward me his glasses are so dirty i can barely see the

1457
05:25:45,880 --> 05:25:51,340
eyes hiding beneath them i see you haven't regained your speech you need to find another

1458
05:25:51,340 --> 05:25:58,409
doctor i haven't slept a wink in many days i don't think this is good for me i hear this voice all

1459
05:25:58,409 --> 05:26:06,040
the time can you hear it her heavenly voice the doctor stares right into my eyes mud drips from

1460
05:26:06,040 --> 05:26:10,360
his face he hasn't blinked in over a minute no you don't why would you you don't know her

1461
05:26:11,560 --> 05:26:16,840
he steps towards me and lowers his voice i'm a bit fed up with her i've bit a little tiny bit

1462
05:26:17,560 --> 05:26:22,840
she must know i'm heading her way i'm doing everything i can i don't eat i don't sleep i

1463
05:26:22,840 --> 05:26:27,319
search under every rock under every fucking bush she must understand it she must give me some time

1464
05:26:27,319 --> 05:26:36,709
some little time off tell her this will you kind of losing it here the doctor is lost in thoughts

1465
05:26:36,709 --> 05:26:42,229
a cigarette sticks out of his mud covered mouth he's in what remains of his shoe he draws lines

1466
05:26:42,229 --> 05:26:49,209
on the ground they seem to intersect in completely random places i'm waiting he doesn't stop drawing

1467
05:26:49,209 --> 05:26:55,450
he moves away a bit and makes a wide arc with his heel four the doctor flicks his cigarette into

1468
05:26:55,450 --> 05:26:59,049
the dirt stomps on it and drags it along the ground creating the last straight line

1469
05:27:00,169 --> 05:27:29,540
you fuck trying was never my forte okay doc goodbye fish come on oh shit all right i can't

1472
05:28:09,220 --> 05:28:38,540
tried what is that a giant snail what the fuck is that apparently this is the cottage

1473
05:28:39,419 --> 05:28:52,919
the shell is cracked maybe i could break it open should i do that what if it comes out

1474
05:29:05,639 --> 05:29:12,119
whoa rook beneath the shell is completely destroyed the snail shell is probably also

1475
05:29:12,119 --> 05:29:16,680
badly damaged maybe i'd be able to get inside the cottage through the skin on his belly it

1476
05:29:16,680 --> 05:29:44,680
seems quite frail are you the snail speech is incredibly slow creamily and slurred he moves

1477
05:29:44,680 --> 05:29:50,279
his jaw with great effort it looks like it's about to fall off his eyes sag from their sockets they

1478
05:29:50,279 --> 05:29:59,959
dangle from side to side trying to keep me in their sight why are you disturbing my forced

1479
05:30:01,529 --> 05:30:12,650
rest his right eye raises with great effort and wobbles your face what happened to your face

1480
05:30:13,369 --> 05:30:25,610
your hair looks like shit today man let me sorry i've been drinking the chemicals

1481
05:30:27,290 --> 05:30:34,139
stove again the snail's jaw falls so low it almost detached itself from the rest of the body

1482
05:30:35,610 --> 05:30:48,340
you scared me you barely resemble a human cover yourself suddenly i feel a subtle shiver

1483
05:30:48,340 --> 05:30:56,259
beneath my feet the snail's body livens up quiet you hear that do you hear that voice

1484
05:30:57,060 --> 05:31:05,610
the snail tucks his head inside his shell she calls to me can you hear it she's calling to me

1485
05:31:05,610 --> 05:31:09,049
i'm here trapped bound

1486
05:31:13,540 --> 05:31:17,060
the snail falls silent for a long above with the inside of the shell is almost completely silent

1487
05:31:17,700 --> 05:31:22,259
the snail's body suddenly leans forward the wooden construction of the cottage

1488
05:31:22,259 --> 05:31:34,279
creaks under his huge bulk i barely keep my balance cut me loose please i need to get out here if you

1489
05:31:34,360 --> 05:31:46,069
release me i will leave come back tomorrow and i won't be here anymore you can live in my home

1490
05:31:46,630 --> 05:31:57,509
you like it you just need to cut me loose the snail falls silent his enormous head slowly drops

1491
05:31:57,509 --> 05:32:05,580
to the shell giant gleaming drops of mucus appear in his slimy skin you need to understand my

1492
05:32:06,599 --> 05:32:16,009
predicament i'm unable to do anything by myself my legs are numb from lying here

1493
05:32:16,819 --> 05:32:23,860
i can't feel my arms at all i've been lying in the sun gives me this strange pleasure

1494
05:32:24,979 --> 05:32:34,099
but it's time for me to go understand i love you that's not what that says understand i have to

1495
05:32:34,099 --> 05:32:51,180
photo of the road you're going there too everyone is going there it's the world home after all

1496
05:32:54,040 --> 05:33:00,569
once there was a beautiful clearing now everything's coming in water and i've lost

1497
05:33:00,569 --> 05:33:13,779
my gumboots do you have any gumboots on you you're so ugly i feel like puking you barely

1498
05:33:13,779 --> 05:33:28,150
resemble a human being i found work today it was yesterday or a few days ago maybe a year

1499
05:33:29,029 --> 05:33:36,310
i woke up in front of the house i thought i was dreaming i took a step and fell down

1500
05:33:36,310 --> 05:33:50,330
i fell straight through the roof how did this happen uh so i have to cut him loose

1501
05:33:50,409 --> 05:34:13,159
the shells please throw the snow so how do i cut them loose pour salt on him you maniac

1502
05:34:21,240 --> 05:34:25,799
it was blocked by rubble i must find a different way inside

1503
05:34:27,560 --> 05:34:49,049
what is from his shell the shells completely destroyed the shells completely destroyed the

1504
05:34:49,049 --> 05:35:01,580
snail shells probably also badly damaged his skin on his belly it looks like a human hand

1505
05:35:02,220 --> 05:35:07,819
but it's sticky and grown into the shell the key grows out of the palm i should be able to easily

1506
05:35:07,819 --> 05:35:29,979
tear it off key found shed key key to the shed where's there a shed

1507
05:35:43,340 --> 05:36:04,540
i'd get them off maybe a knife some kind of organic cords they're slowly pulsating they're

1508
05:36:04,540 --> 05:36:25,319
surprisingly hard and durable board some kind of cord some kind of cord

1509
05:36:26,680 --> 05:36:42,919
organic cord is this like i can i just like to kill again i can't go anywhere else over here

1510
05:36:44,680 --> 05:37:11,110
i would think i'd have to follow this around somewhere oh look bear trap many nails and

1511
05:37:11,189 --> 05:37:15,669
planks some useful scrap metal gun oh this is it okay

1586
06:01:09,369 --> 06:01:22,950
here we go let's see what's in this place up in the snail cavern here we go

1587
06:01:23,830 --> 06:02:15,189
did he leave he left radio this expensive shit no map location found radio tower

1588
06:02:15,750 --> 06:02:26,740
now leave the rope it's useless to me a lot of rusty radio equipment is turned on the floor

1589
06:02:26,740 --> 06:02:31,060
old recorders and destroyed tapes everything's covered in goo dripping from the leaky ceiling

1590
06:02:33,720 --> 06:02:51,369
dead body the dry corpse overgrown with small roots okay so i got the map i got the radio tower

1591
06:02:51,930 --> 06:03:15,659
oh my god that's so far away i guess we go to the radio tower well that was is that the snail

1592
06:03:16,619 --> 06:03:22,340
that's everything that's oh no folks we have nothing to eat since the flood i've caught some

1593
06:03:22,340 --> 06:03:28,439
snails and frogs better this than nothing out of the crosswords i found last year in the old

1594
06:03:28,439 --> 06:03:32,740
wardrobe at the junkyard the only thing that's left is to continue writing the journal and

1595
06:03:32,740 --> 06:03:38,119
listening to the strange radio in two days i will visit the junkyard again maybe i'll finally find

1596
06:03:38,119 --> 06:03:41,959
a tape recorder or something that will allow me to record this weird signal here there's some

1597
06:03:41,959 --> 06:03:48,439
meaning behind it i'm hungry i'm eating grass and whatever i find in the water i've seen some

1598
06:03:48,439 --> 06:03:55,939
strange men between the trees they're not locals they do not hide they were dressed in strange

1599
06:03:55,939 --> 06:04:02,599
clothes but i was too far to take a better look besides i'm alone and there were at least three

1600
06:04:02,599 --> 06:04:08,729
of them maybe i'm delusional maybe these old ruins aren't empty i found a blank tape and

1601
06:04:08,729 --> 06:04:13,400
a broken tape recorder maybe i can fix it and do something with it i've also found some other

1602
06:04:13,400 --> 06:04:19,419
useful things i've written them down and left them for father later i don't have the strength

1603
06:04:19,419 --> 06:04:24,729
to wear them all on my back is it possible that the radio tower emits the strange signal it's

1604
06:04:24,729 --> 06:04:29,049
been a couple of years since it's been turned over the woods have blocked the way to it

1605
06:04:30,009 --> 06:04:35,939
but no other signal reaches this place from outside it must be that tower i need to take

1606
06:04:35,939 --> 06:04:39,380
a break from this radio i hear this voice everywhere it's strangely familiar i can't

1607
06:04:39,380 --> 06:05:43,689
get it out of my head okay so i can't the radio tower i can't get to the radio tower

1608
06:05:44,330 --> 06:06:07,909
but the junkyard read this now where's the compressor parts the junkyard so that's like

1644
06:16:11,060 --> 06:16:18,540

1645
06:16:19,259 --> 06:16:34,459
compressor here you are repair working compressor i could refill any empty oxygen tanks here

1646
06:16:35,259 --> 06:16:47,900
i don't have any empty oxygen tanks oxygen tanks rusty oxygen tanks they're useless

1647
06:16:48,700 --> 06:17:08,869
well shit okay i've got my weapons i'm almost ready to board up for the night i'm gonna cook this

1648
06:17:09,750 --> 06:17:13,590

1649
06:17:13,590 --> 06:17:23,220
bad happens i don't need this many nails though not like it matters still have heals

1650
06:17:25,319 --> 06:17:35,750

1652
06:17:49,369 --> 06:17:54,009

1653
06:17:54,650 --> 06:18:02,200
let me make sure everything's ready to go so this door is boarded boarded boarded traps traps

1654
06:18:02,919 --> 06:18:17,029
trap exploding barrel thing over here same scenario gonna hang out down here put this back

1655
06:18:17,750 --> 06:18:35,529
don't want light coming through so that's a little bit of light going through i think that's good

1656
06:18:36,169 --> 06:18:46,139
it's that that's fine all right this is gonna be moved over here actually that's all right right

1657
06:18:46,139 --> 06:19:01,560
there here we go you know what board it up i don't want this walking in here close the doors

1658
06:19:04,580 --> 06:19:16,790
board it up i didn't cook the i didn't cook the mushroom i did not cook it i did not this time

1659
06:19:17,509 --> 06:19:56,520
i did not i did not cook the mushroom i did not i did not did i really say it like that i don't

1660
06:19:56,520 --> 06:21:06,630
think i did come on why am i not saying anything because my brain can only do one thing at a time

1661
06:21:07,799 --> 06:21:22,470
uh i have to concentrate when i'm doing something like this i can't speak i love

1662
06:21:22,470 --> 06:21:29,860
cynical germa what do you mean i'm incredibly optimistic i'm incredibly i'm incredibly

1663
06:21:29,860 --> 06:21:46,419
optimistic about this i i've got it cynical i'm not cynical cynical enfp all right just don't move

1664
06:21:47,380 --> 06:21:50,979
in fact if anybody comes in here they get in the axe anyways maybe they won't

1665
06:21:50,979 --> 06:21:54,340
i might get spawned on like three times and then the bear i'm just shooting the barrel

1666
06:21:57,590 --> 06:22:05,419
so while we sit here at night what's the game plan for tomorrow game plan for tomorrow is wires

1667
06:22:05,419 --> 06:22:18,759
to upgrade i need to get oxygen tanks i'm gonna say maybe ted out this way take a look over there

1668
06:22:18,759 --> 06:22:43,830
all right here we go this is where they come up finish looting the rocket yeah maybe i don't

1669
06:22:43,830 --> 06:22:51,319
maybe i don't maybe i don't need it what was in there that i needed i've got a hunting rifle

1670
06:22:51,319 --> 06:22:58,020
the thing is sick into the stream voice no i'm playing this until i'm done

1671
06:23:00,740 --> 06:23:16,299
no i'm not into the stream what are we talking about i've just got some eye goopies or you know

1672
06:23:16,299 --> 06:23:21,860
sometimes you just sit here and you get a blink a few times all right this is where it starts

1673
06:23:21,860 --> 06:23:28,950
i gotta get ready i have not heard anything yet i think i got some good light drainage over here

1674
06:23:28,950 --> 06:23:47,669
so that's probably why i fatigue are we gonna go a full night without anybody showing up to our

1675
06:23:47,669 --> 06:24:01,340
front door this would be phenomenal this would be great i'd be really happy about this don't spend

1676
06:24:01,340 --> 06:24:11,779
one single round swing an axe once in the swamp late game that would be fantastic let me get the

1677
06:24:11,779 --> 06:25:16,340
random dumb roll the one time in the nearly 20 hours i've played this game four a.m it's not

1701
06:31:01,860 --> 06:31:14,709

1702
06:31:17,110 --> 06:31:20,840
yeah but we both don't have to like the same stuff that's all right

1703
06:31:22,040 --> 06:31:27,619
that means we're different you know if you love sun chips

1704
06:31:30,779 --> 06:31:49,220
but i mean we can still you know we can still be friends i don't have any lock picks i didn't bring

06:31:49,220 --> 06:31:59,860
any wasting time shut up

1706
06:32:14,259 --> 06:32:23,770
germa who would win in a fight you and me every time i don't care who it is

1707
06:32:24,569 --> 06:32:48,709
all right let's go open this chest i want the goodies inside that's a lot of stuff

1709
06:33:01,060 --> 06:33:34,169
okay just keep moving almost the junk oh sorry junkyard why is it the loudest thing in the whole

1710
06:33:34,169 --> 06:33:52,619
game that is that's louder than everything else in the whole game junkyard and i got my shovel

1711
06:33:52,619 --> 06:34:06,650
the doctor turns his mud-covered head towards the sun and freezes then he spreads his arms

1712
06:34:06,650 --> 06:34:14,299
along his sides warm a chunk of mud falls down on his exposed tongue he chews it slowly and

1713
06:34:14,299 --> 06:34:31,930
swallows it with satisfaction i'll take the embryo it's might as well try to level up

1714
06:34:32,569 --> 06:34:41,270
before it's over the doctor puts the muddy hand into his mouth premises and pulls out a yellow

1715
06:34:41,270 --> 06:34:46,630
tooth he puts it into his pocket of his torn trousers the tooth falls through a hole he does

1716
06:34:46,630 --> 06:34:51,509
not notice this the doctor begins staring at a nearby tree trunk paying no attention to the

1717
06:34:51,509 --> 06:34:57,909
blood flowing between his lips the doctor glances at me he tilts his head sideways lost in thought

1718
06:34:58,869 --> 06:35:03,909
after a moment he extends his hand towards me as if wanting to grab me by the throat but stops

1719
06:35:04,389 --> 06:35:10,650
he freezes slowly he bends down and grabs a thick branch from the ground he starts biting the bark

1720
06:35:10,650 --> 06:35:16,090
off of it he swallows the bark with an effort but also great satisfaction he places the stick

1721
06:35:16,090 --> 06:35:20,490
among the other sticking out from the mud-covered head out from his mud-covered head

1722
06:35:21,689 --> 06:35:28,860
doctor approached me i can feel him embracing me why am i letting him do this i hear his horse

1723
06:35:28,939 --> 06:35:40,869
breath and smell his odor i hear his whisper soon very soon not long from now

1775
06:49:02,979 --> 06:49:58,860
maybe a little bit more over this way come on in oh man sometimes you gotta stretch

1776
06:49:58,860 --> 06:50:08,470
just stretch it up can you please write how you like your eggs cooked in descending order best to

1777
06:50:08,470 --> 06:50:18,869
worst sure s tier s plus no match completely unmatched is a hard-boiled egg that has a jammy

1778
06:50:18,869 --> 06:50:27,259
yolk but not too soft jammy but not too soft and it has to be hot i'm talking right out of the

1779
06:50:28,540 --> 06:50:41,029
boiling water you peel it a little bit of salt hot yep s plus tier over hard no over medium

1780
06:50:41,029 --> 06:50:48,759
but like almost almost too hard very close incredibly close so from there a fresh

1781
06:50:48,759 --> 06:50:59,349
hard-boiled egg right there bang s somewhere at a is a over medium egg like fried on a flat top

1782
06:50:59,349 --> 06:51:04,869
i don't like over easy over easy is down somewhere at f i do not like a runny egg it gets everywhere

1783
06:51:05,430 --> 06:51:12,840
i it's it's not to me it is not cooked it's not fully cooked all the way but let me hold on

1784
06:51:13,080 --> 06:51:16,119
let me i know people are probably gonna get really upset about this but let me try to read right what

1785
06:51:16,119 --> 06:51:23,080
i'm trying to say here so there is over easy which is good where the egg is cooked but there

1786
06:51:23,080 --> 06:51:30,279
are people that do over easy where they they only cook the part of the egg that is the white part

1787
06:51:30,919 --> 06:51:36,340
that's i don't like that and you it's literally raw in the middle if raw egg in the middle is

1788
06:51:36,340 --> 06:51:44,389
not appetizing to me at all um an over medium egg with a jammy middle bingo that's a also on

1789
06:51:44,389 --> 06:51:53,529
the a tier i would put a poached egg poached egg sits right up next to over medium in fact poached

1790
06:51:53,529 --> 06:52:03,909
egg might also be up at s in fact i'm gonna have to say it is yes exposed by kim what did kim say

1791
06:52:04,470 --> 06:52:17,700
let me expose what what what what did she say poached his s yes poached egg on toast

1792
06:52:18,500 --> 06:52:23,779
he likes his egg well done no i like it i like it like like 10 to 12 minutes and hard boiled

1793
06:52:26,220 --> 06:52:39,419
where scrambled um scrambled is like b i think medium no no i like it like over medium to over

1794
06:52:39,419 --> 06:52:50,729
hard she said you like your eggs completely raw that's that's absolute horseshit no you guys are

1795
06:52:51,290 --> 06:53:03,930
that's that's a joke blue egg rare eggs there's no such thing as a rare egg you either cook an egg

1796
06:53:03,930 --> 06:53:14,810
or you don't all right you um you got me all twisted here hard boiled egg is at top fresh out

1798
06:53:23,220 --> 06:53:32,009

1804
06:54:21,909 --> 06:54:31,430

07:01:46,439 --> 07:01:53,930
there are no such thing as wrong opinions on food if all right what well let me ask you this

1846
07:01:53,930 --> 07:01:59,130
what do you guys think wait everybody quiet this is important this is super important i gotta ask

1847
07:01:59,130 --> 07:02:04,919
your question everybody everybody quiet for a second this is very important shit have you ever

1848
07:02:04,919 --> 07:02:14,409
heard have you ever heard of worm cheese it's the most expensive finest cheese in the world

1849
07:02:15,209 --> 07:02:20,279
it is the most expensive shit it's the most expensive cheese on earth it's incredibly delicious

1850
07:02:20,279 --> 07:02:27,209
but it's it's it's it's covered in worms there are fucking maggots and meal worms in it is that

1851
07:02:28,650 --> 07:02:41,590

1853
07:03:05,979 --> 07:03:12,939

1854
07:03:12,939 --> 07:03:17,819
and they like it if somebody eats worms all right forget about the cheese part if somebody just eats

1855
07:03:17,819 --> 07:03:26,869

2055
08:04:48,650 --> 08:04:56,860
me realistically how much time is left in the game like what how much how much is left for me

2056
08:04:56,860 --> 08:05:16,180
to do about like two hours give or take about two hours okay between like 20 minutes and two hours

2057
08:05:17,139 --> 08:05:34,380
one to two hours we're gonna do it we're gonna do it so here's what's gonna happen i'm gonna

2058
08:05:34,380 --> 08:05:39,900
go eat a piece of lettuce i'm just gonna go i need to walk away from it for a minute we're all good

2059
08:05:39,900 --> 08:05:44,659
everything's good i just i'm gonna go eat a piece of pop some i'm gonna eat like two three peanuts

2060
08:05:46,180 --> 08:05:52,650
and then let's go i'll be right back don't go anywhere unless i mean it's might be getting

2061
08:05:52,650 --> 08:07:31,849
late for you but see you soon all right got some peanuts it was that smoke monster thing

2062
08:07:32,490 --> 08:07:52,810
that fucked me all up that was like the catalyst for the near meltdown we're supposed show us your

2063
08:07:52,810 --> 08:08:05,180
peanuts they're very boring but if you want to see them again it's just default planter's peanuts

2064
08:08:05,900 --> 08:08:27,580
nothing special peanuts are not nuts what do you mean they're legumes

2065
08:08:33,700 --> 08:08:45,110
contains a peanut oh here we go oh here we go here we go again here it comes again

2066
08:08:45,990 --> 08:09:01,209
i wanted to fucking pee my pants man at that stupid smoke dragon but i didn't get it

2067
08:09:01,849 --> 08:09:16,360
it's all good not eating raw peanuts well let's think about like okay it's been like eight

2068
08:09:16,360 --> 08:09:23,349
more than eight hours should should i call it no because realistically speaking look at this map

2069
08:09:23,990 --> 08:09:28,470
well i'm gonna come back and do this for like an hour and 10 minutes like in a few days

2070
08:09:30,169 --> 08:09:49,189
no i'm good to go you gotta go all in sometimes not every time he thinks he's done in two hours

2071
08:10:04,099 --> 08:10:07,380
finally some relief for his protein star to bring

2072
08:10:07,939 --> 08:10:22,220
me i can't i can't see anything i can't see i can't see anything where am i oh my god this is three

2074
08:10:35,419 --> 08:10:44,860
for like 40 minutes one to two hours tops okay well whatever let's just do it it's been a long

2075
08:10:44,860 --> 08:10:49,099
time since i've had like four streams in a row and like this stream like this where it's more

2076
08:10:49,099 --> 08:10:56,569
than eight to ten hours it's been a while we also stopped a fight about steak that's true

2077
08:11:06,490 --> 08:11:10,250
just don't get stuck in your own traps that's never not going to happen i could have eaten

2078
08:11:12,819 --> 08:11:27,619
i love the protein star brain that's hilarious i mean it's true my diet's been fucked up because

2079
08:11:27,619 --> 08:11:32,340
i haven't been able to eat certain things but that was quick did you see that was like a lizard

08:22:57,240 --> 08:23:10,060
eventually you're gonna get stomach ache if you eat too many peanuts i mean i i eat peanut butter

2118
08:23:10,220 --> 08:23:18,869
all the time peanut butter is like one of my favorite things in the world it's got tons of

2119
08:23:18,869 --> 08:23:27,580
protein tons of vitamins for you peanut butter is incredible you know you can live off of peanut

2120
08:23:27,580 --> 08:23:48,180
butter do you know that okay i'm ready to go i am prepared i got all my shit i got some heels right

2122
08:23:57,299 --> 08:24:09,639
bingo now i want to head down here to the swamp cottage everything's done crunchiest smooth

2123
08:24:12,060 --> 08:24:15,180
i don't have anything i don't this is not one of those like here we go he's gonna here we go

2124
08:24:15,180 --> 08:24:22,220
no it's uh i like them both but smooth is um i like it better just like i eat it with a spoon

2125
08:24:26,900 --> 08:24:34,099
incorrect it's okay all right let's go check out and see what this is this guy with the mask on

2126
08:24:34,099 --> 08:25:04,069
i need a mask i need a mask holy shit i need a mask let's go that's the power of peanuts

2127
08:25:04,069 --> 08:25:31,779
i must just drop my mouse this has to be a way higher still have this sorry it is that

2128
08:25:31,779 --> 08:25:36,580
i was wondering what the fuck that was it's little tendrils okay remember i didn't know what was

2129
08:25:36,580 --> 08:25:42,459
going on there now i know i just have to see and look where the things were coming from

2130
08:25:43,180 --> 08:25:50,740
and i was able to focus on it very clearly because that's the power of peanuts

2131
08:25:52,389 --> 08:26:22,360
look at i'm already back all right where's this cottage right here no down further creamy or

2132
08:26:22,360 --> 08:26:27,880
crunchy i like creamy peanut butter better than crunchy it's not i love crunchy peanut butter

2133
08:26:29,240 --> 08:26:36,279
but if i had to choose it would be creamy i like it better on sandwiches if you spread uh peanut

2134
08:26:36,279 --> 08:26:41,080
butter and fluff it's an all-time classic one of my favorite sandwiches pretty much ever when i was

2135
08:26:41,080 --> 08:27:17,909
a kid i have a soft spot i have a soft spot for peanuts um a second here damn you guys take a lot

2136
08:27:17,909 --> 08:27:47,509
of hits i'm just keeping the hunting rifle out i mean i'm here how do i get in here

2137
08:27:55,020 --> 08:28:09,909
what the hell have you done i thought he was in front of me

2138
08:28:13,900 --> 08:28:17,020
i really thought he was in front of me that scared the fucking shit out of me

2139
08:28:17,580 --> 08:28:55,450
is there a better way i can get up there here we go gas tank watch out for that thing you got a lot

2140
08:28:55,450 --> 08:29:11,689
of these what okay just me that's me doing that the cottage is surrounded by a barricade

2141
08:29:11,689 --> 08:29:21,590
made out of old furniture and rusty barbed wire probably stolen from some fence that's a lot of

2142
08:29:21,590 --> 08:29:41,479
scrap metal what are you doing to me is it one down here too barricaded i still don't understand

2143
08:29:44,119 --> 08:30:13,939
that's another trap i'm so i'm panicking about these things i don't need to be panicking

2144
08:30:13,939 --> 08:30:18,740
those things are not that big of a deal yes they are yes they are yes they are are they

08:34:53,880 --> 08:34:57,159
the punches so hard the hood of his rubber cloak lands on his mask's visor

2178
08:34:58,459 --> 08:35:05,099
not now i'm not in front of a stranger it's just like these lunatics who run around the

2179
08:35:05,099 --> 08:35:09,819
woods searching for god knows what there used to be more of them i guess most of them starved to

2180
08:35:09,819 --> 08:35:14,680
death i remember when they appeared not far from here must have been around two years ago around

2181
08:35:14,680 --> 08:35:20,759
two dozen of them they were led by these three weirdos dressed in old rags they set up camp at

2182
08:35:20,759 --> 08:35:27,319
the marsh there between the trees they watched our house stared right into my windows the oddities

2183
08:35:27,799 --> 08:35:31,880
i thought they wanted to kidnap my children or harm them in some way but when the night

2184
08:35:31,880 --> 08:35:38,470
fell i lost sight of them there was no one there in the morning apart from these two here and

2185

he's visibly scared his lush mop of hair veils of restless wide open pair of eyes the kid is

2226
08:45:35,139 --> 08:45:39,700
whispering as if reciting something under his breath the boy cowers and presses his back against

the softball which starts to ooze with a white goo hey just hold on there

2228
08:45:48,380 --> 08:45:53,130
the boy is terrified slowly he slumps down from the wall to the ground curling into a ball

2229
08:45:53,130 --> 08:46:00,259
the murmur turns into a loud recitation little bear ate a bowl of soup then another bear came

2230

and there were two four little bears made a sudden poo wow on came the fifth and took a little bow

2523
10:21:46,019 --> 10:21:53,370
as if i've just woken up at last i feel my sore legs buckling underneath me a body becoming heavy

2524
10:21:53,370 --> 10:21:59,370
and overlooking overwhelmingly lethargic it was a grueling journey 32 days of human torment

2525
10:22:00,980 --> 10:22:05,690
closer fighting off sleepiness with difficulty i lean over the bed the springs creak noisily

2526
10:22:05,690 --> 10:22:10,489
under the weight of my hand as i cast my glance on the light brown construction from plywood i

2527
10:22:10,489 --> 10:22:16,970
notice familiar features they are elongated and arched i can smell the fresh sheets in the

2528
10:22:16,970 --> 10:22:26,650
pleasant warmth of the quilt look under the bed i feel a gentle draught coming from the dark gap

2529
10:22:28,069 --> 10:22:42,900
between the bed and the floor reach under the bed my fingertips brush a thin layer of dust

2530
10:22:42,900 --> 10:22:46,819
coldness moisture i'm touching something rough but my arm is too short to catch it

2531
10:22:47,379 --> 10:23:19,099
i think i need to move the bed move the bed was it bugs rats what the fuck is this

2532

2533
10:23:53,940 --> 10:24:11,500
this one flies is covering a black sore in his back old weathered clothes the steep slope blocks

2534
10:24:11,500 --> 10:24:18,470
the way ahead there are some tunnels at its base it's a meter wide tunnel covered with a slimy

2535
10:24:18,470 --> 10:24:22,790
membrane further inside i can see pulsating growths blocking the way ahead i won't be able

2536
10:24:22,790 --> 10:24:44,330
to pass through this way my trousers they're completely destroyed dirty clumped hair cover

2537
10:24:44,330 --> 10:24:52,330
the woman's face she's murmuring in her sleep clutching a rag doll filled with straw now the

2538
10:24:52,330 --> 10:25:10,309
moon has faded the night is here the sleep stole over my doll so close so close your eyes

2539
10:25:14,199 --> 10:25:26,019
uh i'm at the bottom of huge valley i feel the dry dusty earth pulsating into my feet

2540
10:25:27,059 --> 10:25:31,819
it hums something quietly in its sleep swaying to the rhythm of a simple melody

2541
10:25:32,459 --> 10:25:45,370
i'll wake up figure he's dead asleep i'm unable to wake him up shiny stone talking in its sleep

2543
10:26:07,139 --> 10:26:13,860
a faint whisper stasiak my little stasiak sleep stasiak sleep face is covered in mud and sticks

2544
10:26:13,860 --> 10:26:30,419
it clutches shiny stone figures dead asleep i can't wake them up looks like a skeleton

2545
10:26:30,419 --> 10:26:36,839
coated in skin he smiles wildly the figure sleeps on a muddy ground resting its head on the chest

2546
10:26:36,839 --> 10:26:45,769
of a skeleton lying next to it everyone's sleeping clutches a muddy brass cross in both hands repeating

2547
10:26:45,769 --> 10:26:56,650
some incomprehensible words the figure speaks to someone in his sleep squeezing an old man's

2548
10:26:56,650 --> 10:27:05,529
photo in his hand the emaciated figure sleeps soundly embracing the remains of a child

2549
10:27:06,489 --> 10:27:21,910
another sleeping figure hands okay sleeping figure sleeping everyone's just sleeping sleeping

2550

2557
10:29:46,730 --> 10:29:56,309
i'm standing in front of an enormous being place hand on being filming soothing feeling of security

2558
10:29:56,309 --> 10:30:05,529
and happiness vast valley at the bottom of which i stand curves upwards closing over my head the

2559
10:30:05,529 --> 10:30:12,870
rust of distant trees turns into a single silent murmur feel i'm coming home to my flat to my room

2560
10:30:12,870 --> 10:30:34,260
with a window in bed i feel heat emanating from the being i sense my pulse slowing down

10:33:39,819 --> 10:33:50,220
clutches a rusty object covered with old beads some weapon but what do you got the man is talking

2573
10:33:50,220 --> 10:33:53,500
in his sleep he's the only snippets of sentences single words spoken gently and slowly it's hard

2574
10:33:53,500 --> 10:34:01,029
to find any meaning in them leave without opening his eyes the man clumsily waves his hand at me

2581
10:35:32,099 --> 10:35:41,510
huge roots blocked away even if i manage to climb them everything is surrounded by a steep slope

2584
10:36:18,489 --> 10:36:22,970
this list once you get past 10 people killed that might be innocent in a video game you're a psycho

2587
10:38:37,699 --> 10:40:07,830
it's too many it's okay sprint how do i skip the cutscene that was crazy a great fire consumed

2588
10:40:07,830 --> 10:40:26,089
the woods for a couple days gradually claiming many of its inhabitants you're a sicko that's

2589
10:40:26,089 --> 10:40:37,690
the first thing i saw the fire consumed the last road leading to the heart of the woods

2590
10:40:38,569 --> 10:40:50,839
the doctor who did not wake up even as the flames came closer the doctor made it all the way through

2591
10:40:51,480 --> 10:40:57,260
that's at least one npc that got to live the three outcasts wearing old rags and scrap who

2592
10:40:57,260 --> 10:41:11,269
brief stricken under the enormous completely burnt tree didn't even attempt to run the elephant

2593
10:41:11,269 --> 10:41:24,440
family who did not leave their house at the swamp even as the flame started consuming it the chicken

2594
10:41:24,440 --> 10:41:37,209
lady who set out into the woods in search for her sister and lost the way not everyone perished i

2595
10:41:37,209 --> 10:41:45,610
think i got the bad ending i didn't get the true bad ending heo trek did not live to see the fire

2596
10:41:45,610 --> 10:41:50,410
before the flames appeared he rose above the treetops and his rocket made up scrap as he looked

2597
10:41:50,410 --> 10:41:54,970
through the small spaceship window he smiled for the last time the milky ways and stars looked so

2598
10:41:54,970 --> 10:42:00,250
beautiful even now and moving away at a huge speed slide he was exploded on the ground

2599
10:42:00,250 --> 10:42:23,300
incomprehensible whispers and calls ceased forever they saw incoming helicopters above the destroyed

2600
10:42:23,300 --> 10:43:26,150
land wolf snout remains unknown there it is that was a good game first impressions uh first

2601
10:43:26,150 --> 10:43:38,279
impressions of the game this is good i think um my first impressions once i figure out the

2602
10:43:38,279 --> 10:43:44,730
inventory management i think i'll start to give a better idea because the stacks are weird so

2603
10:43:44,730 --> 10:43:48,169
some things don't stack about when i figure that out i've only had like three or four items in my

2604
10:43:48,169 --> 10:44:01,510
inventory so far so i'm sure it'll get easier last impressions this was a solid game i feel like um

2605
10:44:03,480 --> 10:44:10,949
at least for me chapter two that this last like hour was great but there was like a little tiny

2606
10:44:10,949 --> 10:44:29,400
part of chapter two that i just i it was killing me but sometimes it needs some peanuts and we're

2607
10:44:29,400 --> 10:44:40,169
good i wonder how much of that portion that like 20 minute portion of chapter two that i was getting

2608
10:44:40,169 --> 10:44:44,569
straight on and i was getting frustrated i wonder if it's because i would have like low protein brain

2609
10:44:46,819 --> 10:44:56,680
it's probably it's probably pretty accurate no that was good that was really good i'm glad

2610
10:44:56,680 --> 10:45:08,169
i got to finish the whole thing on stream thanks for watching i will see you guys again

2611
10:45:09,940 --> 10:45:17,000
on uh let's see i have a couple things oh by the way i want to talk about the i want to talk about

2612
10:45:17,000 --> 10:45:23,080
the just really quick before you leave but you can leave if you want but uh halloween there's

2613
10:45:23,080 --> 10:45:29,080
going to be a special stream uh whether it's the 28th 29th 30th 31st i'm not sure yet we have to

2614
10:45:29,080 --> 10:45:34,919
lock it in there's going to be a secret slime channel in the discord and what's going to

2615
10:45:34,919 --> 10:45:41,319
happen here is all you really need to know is on 31st you're going to be able to slime me

2616
10:45:42,040 --> 10:45:47,720
or maybe you won't maybe you will but you're going to have a channel in the discord to come

2617
10:45:47,800 --> 10:45:55,239
up with actions for me that you think i'm going to do without me knowing so oh scratch your nose

2618
10:45:56,040 --> 10:46:02,779
if i do that and it's part of the first round like probably about 10 rounds so probably well

2619
10:46:02,779 --> 10:46:13,610
it's hard for me to speak i just have to search for words up here but uh you guys have to come

2620
10:46:13,610 --> 10:46:21,480
up with things that you think that i do but that i will do on camera to dump a bucket of slime on

2621
10:46:21,480 --> 10:46:27,660
my head and also at the same time you are also going to be up against some bullshit here too

2622
10:46:27,660 --> 10:46:35,019
because i'm going to come up with shit that you can't do and if you say it in the chat you're out

2623
10:46:35,019 --> 10:46:44,650
for the rest of the game it's happening on halloween those of you that want a good um

2624
10:46:44,650 --> 10:46:52,580
indicator of exactly what this is go watch an episode just even one snippet of figure it out

2625
10:46:52,580 --> 10:47:01,699
from nickelodeon back in the 90s that secret slime action is kind of what this is inspired by so

2626
10:47:01,699 --> 10:47:09,930
oh and i am i am going to win everybody in chat is worth one point i start with like 10 000 points

2627
10:47:09,930 --> 10:47:14,250
every time i get slimed i get reduced by about 500 to 1000 points we're not trying to get those

2628
10:47:14,250 --> 10:47:22,199
numbers correct every time somebody gets snapped deleted from chat you guys lose a point so 100

2629
10:47:22,199 --> 10:47:25,160
people say the thing that they're not supposed to saying at the end of the round found out though

2630
10:47:25,160 --> 10:47:31,139
that you said it that's minus 100 points each person's worth one how many buckets of slime is

2631
10:47:31,139 --> 10:47:38,940
it gonna be gonna make we're gonna make like a a big batch of just random easy slime i want to i

2632
10:47:38,940 --> 10:47:45,099
want to make like a slime that's not like dog shit for the environment so i'm gonna look into that

2633
10:47:45,099 --> 10:47:49,989
try to find out like a good one that's not gonna be a problem because i know that a lot of slimes

2634
10:47:49,989 --> 10:48:01,400
are just like absolute poison right so i'll figure it out that's the one thing i when i looked up

2635
10:48:01,400 --> 10:48:08,660
stuff about slime oh you're making slime slime stuff it's this stuff is like styrofoam 5.0 so

2636
10:48:08,660 --> 10:48:14,500
i don't really want to make just like that's kind of i'd rather try to do something a little more

2637
10:48:15,059 --> 10:48:22,970
eco-friendly but uh that's what's gonna happen we'll talk about it some more obviously when i'm

2638
10:48:22,970 --> 10:48:30,419
back and had some sleep i will see you guys on tuesday so uh one two three i'll see you tuesday

2639
10:48:30,419 --> 10:48:39,959
we've beaten dark wood there are like two or three scary games that some of them aren't even scary

2640
10:48:39,959 --> 10:48:45,180
but they're gonna be here for halloween look under your bed oh i'm gonna make sure that there's no

2641
10:48:45,819 --> 10:48:52,569
pulsating twigs under my bed i'll make sure but that was dark wood and that was my stream

2642
10:48:52,569 --> 10:48:57,690
thanks this is a long one 11 hours almost thanks everybody for staying if you just i mean there's

2643
10:48:57,690 --> 10:49:04,629

2644
10:49:04,629 --> 10:49:15,690
vegan you know what i'm saying and i will see you guys holy shit does it work does it actually work

2645
10:49:15,690 --> 10:49:35,300

2646
10:49:35,300 --> 10:49:35,860
fucked up

2647
10:49:39,510 --> 10:49:45,050
has this been counting down since yesterday this has been running a sub train in the back

2648
10:49:45,050 --> 10:49:50,379
route for the whole stream and hadn't even been on that's so funny just let it go i'm just gonna

2649
10:49:50,379 --> 10:49:57,400
leave it there i'm gonna i'm going to spend these next few days especially probably tomorrow i'm

2650
10:49:57,400 --> 10:50:06,360
gonna figure this shit out and make sure it works but uh let me see let me see how many bits we have

2651
10:50:06,360 --> 10:50:27,129
here here comes a time gifter if someone doesn't gift a sub in the next 90 seconds this channel is

2652
10:50:27,129 --> 10:50:37,739
gonna get deleted i don't know if that's how it works uh we can do the bits i'm gonna really just

2653
10:50:37,739 --> 10:50:43,930
kind of go through them quickly though because it is very very very late thank you to marvosh

2654
10:50:43,930 --> 10:50:50,620
magali for the 250 they showed the halloween map with j elbertson's thing that's so awesome by the

2655
10:50:50,620 --> 10:51:12,760
way i'm absolutely fucking floored that i have a banner on a tf2 map that's awesome oh i'm stupid

2656
10:51:12,760 --> 10:51:26,220
i need to close this and put on the music there we go but uh yeah if if you weren't here earlier

2657
10:51:27,260 --> 10:51:36,360
in the new tf2 halloween map there's a reference to the carnival stream that's crazy it's really

2658
10:51:36,360 --> 10:51:43,449
cool i'm probably gonna go check it out and see and just take a look at it yeah holy shit

2659
10:51:44,330 --> 10:51:52,519
somebody did it somebody subscribed wait did it reset oh that's what that means right

2660
10:51:54,839 --> 10:51:59,319
hey it's time for slime thanks for the 300 bits our username will finally be relevant when this

2661
10:51:59,319 --> 10:52:05,639
halloween stream comes yeah it's gonna be great also thanks for your five community subs as well

2662
10:52:06,839 --> 10:52:16,139
uh cyrus dexter thanks for the 265 appreciate it thank you family kidneys for the 500 bits

2663
10:52:16,139 --> 10:52:31,260
they say free hong kong we're in a pretty terminalistic world at the moment but yeah

2664
10:52:31,260 --> 10:52:44,410
it's it's really odd to see just at least in my opinion when when shit like this is going down

2665
10:52:45,050 --> 10:53:03,160
germans can get banned unless it's gonna fire you my senator was talking about it yeah no this this

2666
10:53:03,160 --> 10:53:12,199
shit is fucking really coming up to a head here and hopefully hopefully this gets resolved in the

2667
10:53:12,199 --> 10:53:20,540
good way you know obviously i'm a proponent of democracy very much so i mean i live in the

2668
10:53:20,540 --> 10:53:43,980
united states i live in hong kong and it's very sad that this is happening yeah but the thing is

2669
10:53:43,980 --> 10:53:53,660
when when i'll give you my just short 30 second blurb of this whole thing i really don't know why

2670
10:53:54,379 --> 10:54:03,180
blizzard would take prize money from someone i've like that's just it just seems ridiculous

2671
10:54:09,500 --> 10:54:14,059
like i was talking i forget who was talking about this but it's like okay if you ban somebody from

2672
10:54:14,059 --> 10:54:19,029
a tournament but they win the tournament you know what i mean like you you didn't ban them from the

2673
10:54:19,029 --> 10:54:23,029
tournament you're like just banned them from winning you banned them from winning the tournament

2674
10:54:27,430 --> 10:54:32,470
it's like oh hey i i've got i won some money on this tournament you're banned from that

2675
10:54:32,470 --> 10:54:40,699
tournament well i already is in the tournament well you just shit you're banned from it though

2676
10:54:40,699 --> 10:54:45,349
that's like it's like getting arrested it's like a it's like a police officer asking you

2677
10:54:45,349 --> 10:54:51,269
son have you ever smoked marijuana before in your life it's like yeah you're under arrest

2678
10:54:53,910 --> 10:55:01,099
did you smoke marijuana yesterday yeah you have any on you right now no you're under arrest

2679
10:55:01,660 --> 10:55:13,110
what but also i'm also of the opinion that if let's say if somebody is like a fan of hearthstone

2680
10:55:13,110 --> 10:55:22,120
let's say somebody loves hearthstone there are way more people in blizzard than just the top

2681
10:55:22,120 --> 10:55:31,620
five people that make decisions and it's a problem at the top not a problem with the people that care

2682
10:55:31,620 --> 10:55:47,529
about those games so anytime somebody says well you stop supporting blizzard stop supporting

2683
10:55:47,529 --> 10:55:53,300
hearthstone stop supporting warcraft there are people that have put their whole lives into those

2684
10:55:53,300 --> 10:56:02,410
games dedicated their whole lives people that have built those worlds you know and they probably have

2685
10:56:02,410 --> 10:56:14,699
the same feelings that a lot of people do they still get paid for that you're not hurting them

2686
10:56:15,430 --> 10:56:20,620
no i know but but still you just you got to remember that there's this there's a lot of

2687
10:56:20,620 --> 10:56:31,059
people it's it's not just it's not just you that feel this way and there is an issue with

2688
10:56:32,500 --> 10:56:40,089
essentially people running companies that decide everything for everybody else kind of

2689
10:56:40,809 --> 10:56:48,949
which i mean that that's what happens when you run a company even if it means

2690
10:56:50,620 --> 10:57:00,010
they're going to do something that's not seen as right or it's wrong or it's sensitive but sometimes

2691
10:57:00,010 --> 10:57:17,940
the bottom line is what matters to a lot of these companies so it's a weird position that was a

2692
10:57:17,940 --> 10:57:30,569
long 30 seconds it's like a full five minutes but i do i do want to give i mean obviously

2693
10:57:34,139 --> 10:57:37,260
i'll tell you what's going to be blizzcon is going to be very interesting

2694
10:57:37,980 --> 10:57:43,080
because it's almost like they've i don't know what the fuck they're going to do

2695
10:57:43,720 --> 10:57:56,870
what are they going to be like hey everybody all right hey here's uh here's diablo four

2696
10:57:58,970 --> 10:58:13,430
right isn't that great that's great right that's good shit isn't it right most people still gonna

2697
10:58:13,430 --> 10:58:21,639
go yeah but think about that though right like imagine that's in like two or three weeks imagine

2698
10:58:21,639 --> 10:58:31,400
you already booked your hotel you booked your flight like it's okay to still enjoy things

2699
10:58:35,589 --> 10:58:40,389
but i severely disagree with all the stuff that the people at the top have decided to do

2700
10:58:41,110 --> 10:59:00,980
severely completely but we'll see i don't know maybe something happened here maybe

2701
10:59:02,019 --> 10:59:08,870
maybe like the head can get pulled out of the ass and maybe we'll see some it's actually something

2702
10:59:08,870 --> 10:59:30,300
good come from this i don't know did they put a statement out today i'll have to read it after

2703
10:59:30,940 --> 10:59:48,339
but yeah pull heads from ass i really like this music it is very good it was it was it was a

2704
10:59:48,339 --> 10:59:59,620
garbage statement it was a non-answer it was it was it was just like a corporate copy paste like

2705
10:59:59,620 --> 11:00:29,830
alexa wrote it yeah that's unfortunate we'll see what happens we'll move on from that though

2706
11:00:29,830 --> 11:00:40,889
germa please say something extremely controversial i don't i don't think anything i think i think most

2707
11:00:40,889 --> 11:00:49,500
of the things i said it would but a lot of people think i'm not a very complicated person guys you

2708
11:00:49,500 --> 11:00:56,309
know i'm pretty um i kind of see things the way that they are and that's kind of the way that it

2709
11:00:56,309 --> 11:01:18,519
is and that's it he's a simple streamer but he has bad taste in ice cream and steak oh i always

2710
11:01:18,519 --> 11:01:25,239
see blizzard ads when i load up your stream well that's i mean that's a twitch thing though

2711
11:01:29,260 --> 11:01:32,779
i mean i make i make wow references all the time but you have to remember i played

2712
11:01:34,599 --> 11:01:40,730
i don't play blizzard games anymore i don't the last time i opened up overwatch i think was like

2713
11:01:40,730 --> 11:01:48,970
two years ago i downloaded wow classic when it first came out got to like level seven and realized

2714
11:01:48,970 --> 11:01:59,660
holy shit i don't want to do this again it's like wow this is this is i remember what this was like

2715
11:01:59,739 --> 11:02:12,919
i still thought it was interesting though i still thought it was cool

2716
11:02:14,360 --> 11:02:26,419
but i i kind of just don't have the time to do it anymore to do that but yeah i i'm not really

2717
11:02:26,419 --> 11:02:39,720
i don't really have a connection to blizzard at all but you said you play hearthstone every

2718
11:02:39,720 --> 11:02:45,080
night on your ipad maybe a while ago maybe maybe one of the adventures came out like

2719
11:02:46,069 --> 11:02:52,379
three four five months ago i did i played hearthstone yeah like a few months ago yeah

2720

2721
11:03:04,660 --> 11:03:13,180
fucked man what but i'll uh i'll move on from the kind of controversy that's going on in the

2722
11:03:13,180 --> 11:03:25,239
gaming world we'll move on because it is getting late he won't say nevada what are you talking

2723
11:03:25,239 --> 11:03:34,949
about why wouldn't i say even that but i feel hopefully i've tried to articulate some of the

2724
11:03:34,949 --> 11:03:46,599
things that i think hopefully i did i have been streaming for 11 hours so but here we go sad

2796
11:17:25,449 --> 11:17:30,650
annoyed with how bad you were playing but you did the impossible and got the true ending without

2797
11:17:30,650 --> 11:17:35,050
help i'm proud of you though it was stressful like watching your child play with a grenade

2798
11:17:44,819 --> 11:17:55,339
somebody says oh there was help yeah but i mean i i was all right playing a scary horror jumpy

2799
11:17:55,339 --> 11:18:04,150
game for that takes a lot of non-hand holding for like nine ten hours my normal gaming sessions

2800
11:18:04,150 --> 11:18:11,269
even when i'm not on stream even before i was streaming were like four or five hours tops so

2801

those are rookie numbers now thanks a lot dubski and then future gamer thanks for the 250 as this

2803
11:18:29,699 --> 11:18:34,339
channel grows how do you think you will handle a regular everyday chat of 10 000 or 20 000 people

2804
11:18:36,459 --> 11:18:54,739
i do not think that will happen i mean i've had 10 000 and close to 20 000 before but not every day

2805
11:18:55,300 --> 11:19:06,250
i'm not sure that'll happen the amount of time it took we'll think about it right it just go by

2806
11:19:07,720 --> 11:19:14,730
it's taken a long time to get here that i've been you doing youtube and streaming for almost 10

2807
11:19:14,730 --> 11:19:25,180
years and there are a shitload of people that are even here now so i don't know i i can't predict

2808
11:19:25,180 --> 11:19:31,500
that i'm gonna have 20 000 concurrent viewers on this stream i mean you're talking about like the

2809
11:19:31,500 --> 11:19:50,230
top like 20 channels on twitch top 10 i don't know i the doors are open but i'm whatever happens i'm

2810
11:19:50,230 --> 11:20:02,059
comfortable whatever happens happens but how would i handle something like that which is will you know

2811
11:20:02,059 --> 11:20:09,620
you change a few rules you make it a little different and not try not to change anything

2812
11:20:10,489 --> 11:20:19,300
really that much i mean going from 800 to 1000 viewers nothing really changed that much in

2813
11:20:19,300 --> 11:20:25,379
regards to how i approached a stream 1000 to 2000 to 3000 three to four four to five five to six

2814
11:20:27,319 --> 11:20:34,980
i just i approached my approach is the same if i have 10 000 viewers or a thousand

2815
11:20:36,019 --> 11:20:55,180
i don't really change how i do anything but i appreciate the 250 thank you we also had uh

2818
11:21:06,550 --> 11:21:12,309
while we suspected things had gone array before it was not before the dark wood stream that it became

2819
11:21:12,309 --> 11:21:19,400
clear uh jeremy shot a child point blank only concerned with the backpack then he ate a grandma

2820
11:21:19,400 --> 11:21:24,279
alive while her grandson was next door and finally he chopped open the skull of an innocent old blind
