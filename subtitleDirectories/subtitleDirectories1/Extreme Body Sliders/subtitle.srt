1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,100
My child, the task is at hand. You must go undercover to stop the human-dragon conflict.

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,339
Father, I'm not ready.

3
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:30,820
Silence. You've always been ready. You must live among them. Be part of the human race. Find out what it's like to be human.

4
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
But what if I fail?

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:42,820
Take the magical cloaking cloak. It will always disguise you as a human. Our ancestors used dragon wizardry to create the spell that's extremely strong and powerful.

6
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,820
As long as you wear this, you are safe.

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Okay.

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,820
I love you, my son.

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,820
I love you too, dad.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,820
Be careful.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,740
First day. Go in. Meet a few people.

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,869
Good day, folks!

13
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,869
A dragon! I saw a dragon!

14
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:03,869
What?

15
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:04,870
Shit!

16
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:17,870
Cloak doesn't work. Dad, a magic cloak? Really? He was probably just shit-faced. Please stop hitting me with the sword. Please. We can live together in harmony, don't you see?

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:32,920
Maybe a tad on the large side for a head. Longer neck. Put his head forward a little bit. He's real perceptive. He sniffs around a lot. He really must get to the bottom of stuff. He's a private investigator.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:51,900
And I think that's all right. I like it. Maybe a little bit bigger. Yeah, that's good. That's good. We're not going to go any more extreme than this.

19
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,319
Excuse me.

20
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,689
Welcome, child.

21
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,689
I just was wondering...

22
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,689
Stop.

23
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,689
I can't even fucking see anything.

24
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,949
It looks like I seriously took this guy's face and molded it out of clay.

25
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:18,259
Like, this was an art project that I did. I found out that I had to do this art project 15 minutes before it was due. And it was to make a person's face.

26
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,879
I can do better than this.

27
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:40,460
Why is this bullfrog person listening to this guy sitting on a park bench?

28
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:53,550
How can you keep a straight face right there? Would you not be scared of this?

29
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,550
You walk away.

30
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:03,050
See how big my arms are, dude? You have any idea how big my arms are, dude?

31
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:10,050
Sometimes you just gotta run. You know what I mean? Sometimes you're really going to build up that CO2 in your body and breathe it out, and you just kind of go on a little jog with your hands.

32
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,050
You know what I'm saying?

33
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,740
We've got to wrap behind this guy and do our stealthy little secret technique and get my little small sword.

34
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,740
Just get right in the back with the backstab.

35
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
Ugh!

36
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:40,939
The fucking lady's dead, man.

37
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:45,180
Wow. What a sicko.

38
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,939
I have some bad news, honey.

39
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:01,939
I accidentally backed over the cat this morning.

40
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,939
It's okay. He's in high spirits. He's still alright.

41
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:25,779
You know, I actually thought I was going to have way more to say about this.

42
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:29,829
This is a cat riding a horse.

43
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:32,829
I'll see you next year when this is a Disney Pixar movie.

44
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:39,779
You foul humans. We have every right to go through this tunnel.

45
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,209
You can't stop us.

46
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:45,579
Well, you've never seen a cat riding a horse before?

47
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,259
Get cultured.

48
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:52,259
Oh, shit. The fucking Thanksgiving turkey's on the loose.

49
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,500
Everybody watch out.

50
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,959
Hide the women and children.

51
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,959
No sudden movements.

52
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,959
Nothing crazy. I just gotta run my meat shop.

53
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,959
I'm doing well for myself.

54
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,959
I don't have to be concerned that there's an evil Gumby behind me.

55
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,959
Could be much worse.

56
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,579
Just don't let him know that you're afraid.

57
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,579
And everything will be okay.

58
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:29,540
This is a Dark Souls game.

59
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,899
What Dark Souls boss did I make?

60
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,899
Shoot to the arrow. Shoot me right in the penis. Good job.
