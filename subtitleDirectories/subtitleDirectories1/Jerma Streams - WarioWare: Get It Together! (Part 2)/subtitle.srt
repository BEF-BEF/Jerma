1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,139
Alrighty, alright. Let's change in the title and we can go.

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,610
Let's see if I can get to round 50.

3
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,199
How's my cam? Is the cam still fucked up?

4
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm not just gonna go right into it. I'm not just gonna jump into it. I need practice.

5
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,009
This camera.

6
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:41,530
Practice.

7
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,130
I'm gonna go just- I'm gonna just go here and I'm gonna go.

8
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,270
I lost all my points believing in you.

9
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,829
You can't just go right into super hard. I need this- I need like a 10 to 20 minute

10
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:58,149
get my brain going again.

11
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,250
I forget what half these guys even do.

12
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,370
Alright, let's do it.

13
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,340
Three o'clock.

14
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,400
I just read a shitty comment in a sea of handsome streamers.

15
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,750
Not this fucking thing again.

16
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:45,049
Did I do it? Alright, I was gonna say what the hell.

17
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,469
Knock that up, right?

18
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,989
Fuck it up!

19
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,120
Change the weird baby sound effect.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,200
I can't change- It's the sounds of the game, man.

21
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:25,750
Alright, I'm feeling- I'm getting warmed up. I'm feeling the juices flow.

22
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:35,780
The baby color.

23
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,270
Oh, you're talking about that like frog noise.

24
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,590
That's actually-

25
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,990
That's it, right?

26
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:51,189
I don't understand that one.

27
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,629
How- Do you have to just keep doing it?

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,419
It has to be consistent speed.

29
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:21,770
Base cam is delayed.

30
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,050
Yeah, I- I could try to fix it in a minute. Hold on.

31
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,050
Alright, canister, juice, hat, backpack.

32
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,969
Canister, juice, hat, backpack.

33
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,740
Something in my throat.

34
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,539
I need a canister.

35
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,199
Shit, alright.

36
00:03:50,759 --> 00:04:01,340
I need a hat and a back- hat and mug.

37
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,500
I definitely can fix it by doing something here.

38
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,169
Oh, shit. No, no, no. Put this back.

39
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,930
Okay, it's a canister.

40
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,569
The cockroach just keeps freaking me out.

41
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,879
Get that fucking cockroach out of here. It's annoying.

42
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,639
Baby noise is giving us suffering.

43
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,480
You're gonna be fine.

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:50,779
Oh, that's a lot.

45
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,060
150.

46
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:56,300
Hold on a sec.

47
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:05,220
I had- I had way more time than I thought I did.

48
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,620
What time is it?

49
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,079
Move over!

50
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,680
I thought I had like-

51
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:25,300
I thought I had more- I thought I didn't have enough time to do that.

52
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,899
I couldn't move the damn thing.

53
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:33,509
Alright, I'm good.

54
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:43,180
Got it.

55
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:52,680
That- What is-

56
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,079
That's one of the dwarves from the Hobbit movie.

57
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,459
Get it.

58
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,139
Baby noise is funny.

59
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,459
I'm not even hearing it.

60
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:15,129
My lip gloss is-

61
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,069
Ooh, that was close.

62
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,370
My game's not muted.

63
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:29,850
I know, it's like-

64
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:37,800
Okay. I don't like that one. That one sucks.

65
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,379
I might get to 50 on this one.

66
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:02,180
You just gotta get one of those.

67
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,699
Nice bitrate.

68
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,129
I am streaming.

69
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:14,199
I'm streaming at the maximum bitrate that Twitch allows.

70
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:21,480
Okay.

71
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,040
Mug, mug.

72
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,620
864p.

73
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,500
864p is the resolution, not the bitrate.

74
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,100
Oh, I thought we had some smart people here.

75
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:50,629
Alright, what do we got?

76
00:07:50,629 --> 00:08:02,300
Red.

77
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,800
Oh!

78
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,519
Man, man.

79
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,120
Why don't we have 4K stream?

80
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,920
Because if I streamed in 4K with a 6000 bitrate,

81
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,759
it would look like I threw up all over your screen.

82
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:21,689
Guys, 1080p at 60fps with 6000 bitrate does not look good.

83
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:24,509
I would need-

84
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:25,629
This-

85
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,430
Get the fuck out of here.

86
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:33,049
Okay, it was blue, blue.

87
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,330
Okay, blue, blue.

88
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,909
1080p 30, you can-

89
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,230
It might-

90
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,110
You could do okay with.

91
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:43,470
I don't know.

92
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,750
I think a 1080p video at 60fps, you need like a 10,000 bitrate for that to look okay.

93
00:08:50,269 --> 00:09:08,409
Don't you have 3090?

94
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,450
That does not really-

95
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,649
It's just about what Twitch has for their limitations.

96
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,320
I could stream Nvenc with my 3090, and I can't get out.

97
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,879
I can't leave.

98
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,120
It's still the limitation of 6000 bitrate.

99
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,490
I could run at slowest as possible in coding, but that doesn't really do anything.

100
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:36,649
The actual CPU preset and the Nvenc presets here-

101
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,850
Once you go past medium, there's really not a real discernible difference at all.

102
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,220
What fucking time is it?

103
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:53,440
You can go beyond 6K, you have to enable it in OBS.

104
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,799
I mean, I could physically do it, but it's against Twitch's guidelines.

105
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,519
If I strike a stream right now with like 20K bitrate,

106
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,000
and I would get Twitch to turn my channel off, I'd get in trouble.

107
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,070
What?

108
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
Can you stream with a 60fps camera?

109
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,330
Well, here's the thing.

110
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:32,039
I don't- The reason why my camera's not 60fps right now is because my fucking camera is-

111
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,539
Whatever.

112
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,120
You fucked me all up.

113
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,679
Whatever.

114
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,000
Listen, I can do it, but it's-

115
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,960
Look, watch what happens.

116
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,340
39, whatever, I don't care.

117
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,049
So I have to have my exposure up really high

118
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,289
because I don't use webcams that frequently.

119
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:55,850
I don't really care.

120
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,389
So my exposure has to go up, but when you let more light in,

121
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,350
when you pull more light into these webcams, you're opening up the iris.

122
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,590
So the frame rate just gets annihilated.

123
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,230
Ready? Watch this.

124
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:16,860
So I just turn it all off, and I have to restart the camera.

125
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,049
This is not going to go through here.

126
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:21,929
Here we go.

127
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,169
Watch this, ready?

128
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,320
Now the camera has to restart.

129
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,679
I have to restart the camera.

130
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:39,840
Well, you can blame-

131
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,039
So here's the thing, I've talked shit about this in the past.

132
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,409
I don't- I really don't know why every webcam-

133
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,659
Even like the UI for the webcams, like controls and stuff,

134
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,340
are stuck in like 2003.

135
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:04,190
Are we going to get like technology that's not based in like 2004, 2005, or webcam?

136
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,799
Why did they just stop developing better quality webcams?

137
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,159
Did they just think-

138
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,919
Did they realize that nobody really cares after 1080 or after like 720?

139
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,120
And that like an overexposed, like kind of sloppy, shitty exposure is-

140
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,679
I don't understand.

141
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,690
Why is it- Why are we stuck in 2006?

142
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,129
Use a DSLR?

143
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,570
I don't want to set up a gigantic DSLR,

144
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,970
and have a convoluted system to plug it into my-

145
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,940
So I could do a high quality camera on my stream.

146
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,519
I just want technology from like 2016.

147
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,320
Use your phone?

148
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,279
Look, I'm back in 60 FPS, or at least close to it.

149
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,019
Company has software for the camera.

150
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,700
Low quality camera adds to your charm.

151
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:58,990
No, I-

152
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,019
Look, I'm not going to set-

153
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,539
I'm not going to set up a setup like that.

154
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,080
What, for like the four times a year I turn my webcam on for more than 20 minutes?

155
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,840
No, I don't want to do this again.

156
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:22,919
I'm warmed up.

157
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:31,080
Don't you have the money for it?

158
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,519
Just because something is possible does not mean it should be done.

159
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:39,870
What, because I can like set up a DSLR over here,

160
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,909
and have like this elaborate-

161
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,269
I don't want that in my room.

162
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:44,299
No, I don't wa-

163
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,019
I don't want it.

164
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:59,230
I feel psycho.

165
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,629
I don't want you guys to see any of this shit above my face, whatever.

166
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,570
All right, we're going right into it.

167
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,070
Super hard.

168
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:17,799
All right.

169
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,730
Ooh, that little jump down there almost screwed it all up.

170
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:29,879
Patrick!

171
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,419
This guy sucks, Ernest!

172
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,259
Get in it!

173
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

174
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,539
Holy shit, how did I get to 47 last night?

175
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,980
I have no idea.

176
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,799
How on earth did I do that?

177
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,340
Oh, Ashley's not in here.

178
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:28,840
Yeah.

179
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,700
Washed up from one day ago.

180
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,120
Part two.

181
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,210
NOOOOO-

182
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,409
I'm not warmed up at all.

183
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,220
I got to do one more site-

184
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,720
Okay.

185
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:54,750
That team sucked.

186
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,710
It was a bad team.

187
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,429
I'm not-

188
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,309
I was a bad team.

189
00:15:58,269 --> 00:15:59,940
Now I got the good team.

190
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,379
I got the good team.

191
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:02,019
I'm ready to go.

192
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,330
Change the character noises.

193
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,129
I will, after like five more attempts, I promise.

194
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:12,480
Okay, I gotta lean back and relax.

195
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
I'm leaning back and relaxing.

196
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,139
Watch.

197
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,009
I had to go above.

198
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:21,970
Holy shit, Ernest, go off.

199
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:58,259
Oh, he's holding a paper airplane!

200
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,869
Oh, come on!

201
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,369
What?

202
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,640
Oh my fucking god, why?

203
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,109
Shit, some of these-

204
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:35,710
Some of these this fast are impossible.

205
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:42,500
Some of these minigames this fast are actually like not even possible with the 2D characters.

206
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,569
All right, we're going original.

207
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,650
All right, let's try this.

208
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,289
Are you getting better?

209
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:15,089
I gotta get-

210
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:15,809
I gotta warm up.

211
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:25,920
The ones where it's like rock the baby, they give you like a full one second.

212
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,779
I get like maybe a 10th of a second.

213
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,220
You gotta rock up like eight times.

214
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:38,000
That's the last car.

215
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,720
Oh my god, stop.

216
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,920
I'm not getting electrocuted.

217
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,420
I'm fine.

218
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:56,500
That's cheating?

219
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,299
How?

220
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:02,859
I didn't hear!

221
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,920
Oh yeah.

222
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,619
That's not fucking possible.

223
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,579
That's not possible.

224
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:41,859
Seriously, the time-

225
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,779
The wait for the beat?

226
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,099
Like, the fuck are you supposed to do that?

227
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:51,170
Oh, get the rhythm here.

228
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,170
Huh?

229
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:26,369
I want to see the clip where that hit me.

230
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:33,220
I'd like to see the hitbox.

231
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,059
I want to see the clip where that hit me.

232
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,710
Desync.

233
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,829
I'm not desynced.

234
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,890
It's a shitty-

235
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,430
Watch.

236
00:21:54,289 --> 00:22:03,250
Desync.

237
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,130
You're a liar.

238
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:14,029
The desync is a shitty webcam that can't be in a room

239
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,349
that doesn't have a fucking gigantic ring light in your face.

240
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,769
All right, let me see, let me see.

241
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:21,269
What happened?

242
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,619
It's the webcam, it just sucks.

243
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,220
And this is not even an old webcam.

244
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:49,789
I actually don't-

245
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:51,230
I don't mind the guys going that way.

246
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,829
It looks pissed.

247
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,430
I'm pissed at webcam technology.

248
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:01,579
I have an opinion that they just made all the webcams they've ever made

249
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:02,940
10 years ago and just didn't make anymore.

250
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,519
Okay, the worst part about WarioWare for Switch

251
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,119
is because they've changed-

252
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,599
Because you have to be the 2D character,

253
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,240
it's like you move the character and like it's-

254
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,640
A lot of these minigames you need to take like a second to know where to move,

255
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,470
but like you have to move it so quickly within like a second.

256
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:41,839
That's like, how the fuck am I supposed to do that without-

257
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,279
Like all these minigames require you to control the 2D character jumping around.

258
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,839
But if you move even a small amount in that minigame,

259
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,039
you fucking ruin the whole thing.

260
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,309
Fucking GameCube one was better.

261
00:23:56,029 --> 00:24:06,559
Listen to the prompt.

262
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,119
Okay, let me tell you something about the prompt.

263
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:09,839
You ready for the prompt?

264
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,220
If I screamed in your ear an action for you to do,

265
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:22,799
I scream in your ear and you have two tenths of a second to do that action.

266
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,519
You're gonna freak out.

267
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,180
You're gonna be like, what did he say?

268
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,140
What number?

269
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,900
And I'm gonna laugh at you when you get it wrong.

270
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,140
To like, you see what I mean?

271
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,660
Like, what the fuck, man?

272
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,380
It's like they're just moving the character around.

273
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,839
It's like moving the character physically across the plane.

274
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,920
Like, it's just like, it's-

275
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,880
What the fuck?

276
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:05,220
Like, I have to go up and around into the left-

277
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:23,440
Here we go.

278
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,789
God damn it, I tried to-

279
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:03,569
You see what I mean?

280
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,940
Like moving the characters around is so-

281
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
Fucking God, I hate it.

282
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:14,059
I got it.

283
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,480
It's this one.

284
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:31,390
Oh, needing to know like what side you have to move the character is so fucking painful.

285
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:37,730
It's like, okay, so right at the very beginning you gotta move quick,

286
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,250
either left or right with everybody.

287
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:41,490
So it's like, all right, what is the game?

288
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,009
What's going on?

289
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:45,970
And what direction do I have to hold the analog?

290
00:29:45,970 --> 00:30:19,549
I had it.

291
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:22,430
Might fuck around and believe in Jerma.

292
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,700
Now's the time to do it.

293
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,920
Now's the time to do it.

294
00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:01,630
Don't lose faith just yet.

295
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,980
I covered it with my face.

296
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:17,549
Yeah, I like, I'm trying just to press the button,

297
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,670
but moving the fuck around in this game sucks asshole.

298
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:00,579
This game's not tuned correctly to do the super hard.

299
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:02,019
The game's not tuned correctly.

300
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,670
With a 2D game, you gotta play with 2D characters.

301
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,710
The first full second is you trying to figure out what fucking character you are

302
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,559
and what direction you need to move and can that character even do the mini game?

303
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,759
This is not tuned for this.

304
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,000
They- This is a fucking extra mode they put on.

305
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,279
It was never tuned for it.

306
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,400
This is the one.

307
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:46,930
Hey, I'm just telling you right now, bet all your money on this next run.

308
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,640
Bet it all.

309
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm telling you, I'm gonna get it.

310
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,119
Bet every cent you have.

311
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,769
It's so annoying.

312
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:09,569
I think some motherfuckers just go so much faster than others.

313
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:12,289
Like, do people have different fucking speeds?

314
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:13,970
Like, it's- For a game that takes one-

315
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,869
And that's cheating apparently.

316
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,460
Some people look faster than others.

317
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:32,430
This game's a six.

318
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:38,880
Let's see if it can build back and come back to like a 7.9.

319
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,140
Let's see if they can build it back to a 7.9 for me.

320
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,700
Let's find out.

321
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,579
He said go all in.

322
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,730
What's the point of having half of these characters in the game

323
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,409
if only three of them are any good?

324
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:16,800
Let's go.

325
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,519
All right, this is the team.

326
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,320
This is gonna be this-

327
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,519
This is the team.

328
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:20,400
This is the team.

329
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,039
This is the run.

330
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:21,599
This is the team.

331
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,239
Bet everything.

332
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,000
I- I would- Don't listen to me.

333
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:47,380
This is the one.

334
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,260
Bet everything on this one.

335
00:34:48,820 --> 00:35:01,920
All right, this is the one.

336
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,960
Definitely bet on this one.

337
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,179
I- I- My controller got stuck.

338
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:20,769
Bet it all.

339
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:21,329
All of it.

340
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:39,539
Your whole bank account on this one.

341
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:40,980
You're supposed to do that with some characters.

342
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:02,960
Ah!

343
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,670
But we're lives in the ocean.

344
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,170
That one.

345
00:36:51,579 --> 00:37:06,699
That defogged his face!

346
00:37:38,300 --> 00:38:03,380
Super airplane.

347
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:14,179
Fuck it!

348
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:15,139
That character!

349
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:16,099
That character's like-

350
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:17,059
Why am I supposed to-

351
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:17,619
What are you-

352
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:18,119
What?

353
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:18,980
That character-

354
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,860
That character's like-

355
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,360
I was like-

356
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,400
It changed-

357
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,900
Okay.

358
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,710
Here's my complaint.

359
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,460
Some characters changed the actual level.

360
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,659
And in WarioWare,

361
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:56,860
memorizing a level is incredibly important.

362
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,139
And if you have a different character

363
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,460
and that motherfucker changes the whole level-

364
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,139
Oh, I don't think so!

365
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:05,099
Oh my god!

366
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,460
Forty fucking nine!

367
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:09,329
My god!

368
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:09,969
But he was-

369
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,130
Oh my goodness!

370
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,130
You've gotta be kidding me.

371
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:21,039
Oh my god!

372
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,400
It was forty nine.

373
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,679
You've gotta be kidding me.

374
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,559
The one that was like-

375
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,519
Oh, you're gonna shoot?

376
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,519
Hold on to the ring as it changes the fucking whole level.

377
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,070
Oh, I'm so disappointed.

378
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:42,179
Got there once, I'd get there again.

379
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:49,380
I'm going for it.

380
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,880
No.

381
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,059
Fuck the haters.

382
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,500
I'm going in with eighteen vote.

383
00:39:53,059 --> 00:40:08,699
You're a three.

384
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,010
Relax.

385
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:12,769
Everybody relax.

386
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,769
Put every cent you own on this guy.

387
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:46,059
Why wouldn't he move his arms?

388
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:46,559
I-

389
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:13,860
Forty nine!

390
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,659
It's still in my brain.

391
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:31,940
Rent three.

392
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:45,539
Worst fucking character to do this with, really.

393
00:41:51,949 --> 00:42:09,250
Fire you motherfucker!

394
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,449
What are you doing?

395
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:11,250
What?

396
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:11,889
What the hell?

397
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:13,969
Okay.

398
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:14,530
Okay.

399
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,570
What the fuck?

400
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,349
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

401
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:20,670
What?

402
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,630
Like, I'm pressing A and she's not firing.

403
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,170
Does this thing have a battery?

404
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,289
I've charged them overnight.

405
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,429
Okay, we're doing a fuckface team.

406
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:38,929
Don't care.

407
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:43,780
It's goddamn Switch controllers.

408
00:42:44,420 --> 00:43:08,320
Right, it's the controllers.

409
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,199
Yeah, it is the controllers.

410
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
Focusing with every cent you own on this.

411
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:19,340
Every cent you have for channel friends.

412
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:19,840
Oh.

413
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,780
I just burped.

414
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:40,469
People are gonna get just like, pew.

415
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,559
Yeah, that's unfair.

416
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:57,519
Okay, what's the RNG?

417
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:58,019
What's the-

418
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,840
What's the fucking RNG on that one?

419
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,719
What's the RNG on that one?

420
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:02,000
You put Snake on top of the-

421
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:04,880
You can put Snake-

422
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,380
Whatever.

423
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,730
No, you fucking dumb donkey.

424
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,260
I'm just trying to move my character across the goddamn screen, dude.

425
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,579
I'm just trying to move the guy.

426
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:35,059
I don't-

427
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:36,099
Oh, man, hold on.

428
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:37,380
2D WarioWare.

429
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,019
Move guy.

430
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,400
Oops.

431
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:18,710
You just get stuck in this shit, like-

432
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:27,769
I-

433
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:41,539
Three, one-

434
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,380
I gotta start over.

435
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:43,880
It's not gonna work.

436
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:47,239
I got two more lives.

437
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:47,739
It's not gonna-

438
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:51,860
I'm not gonna do it.

439
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,280
Dude, I can't even fucking move.

440
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:56,780
I can't even-

441
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,139
Like, some of these minigames, you get like, stuck on a fucking pixel,

442
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,019
and then like, it's over.

443
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:02,519
You just lose.

444
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,989
Remember when you just had to go like this?

445
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:20,710
Or like this?

446
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,449
Or like this?

447
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:26,480
Or like that?

448
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:52,559
I know.

449
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,920
I can't believe I got to 49.

450
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,559
I'm so mad.

451
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,760
There was like a Satan sitting on my shoulder,

452
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,119
whispering in my ear, just going,

453
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,159
49.

454
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:02,800
49.

455
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,320
You fucked it up, didn't you?

456
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,119
49.

457
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,320
You could have just moved on.

458
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,599
Why can't I fucking touch-

459
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,099
What?!

460
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:16,449
Why wouldn't it flip up?

461
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:20,119
It flipped the other one up, but it wouldn't flip the middle one up?

462
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:21,639
I literally touched it with my head.

463
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:06,260
This is definitely not the one.

464
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,059
I'm not gonna be able to do it.

465
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:07,559
I can't do it.

466
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:09,059
I can't.

467
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:09,940
I can't do it.

468
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,219
I can't do it, guys.

469
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:11,940
I can't do it.

470
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:16,320
Do not bet on this one.

471
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,440
I'm gonna lose this one for sure.

472
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,940
Guaranteed.

473
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,559
There's no way I do it.

474
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,150
No way.

475
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:54,500
Guaranteed to lose it.

476
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,000
Dude!

477
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:05,889
Dude, yes, it's so fucking annoying.

478
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,519
Like, you try to get over there,

479
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:09,239
and he's gonna get like-

480
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,440
Wrong way!

481
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,480
I can't even move the other way.

482
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:15,940
God, it's like the characters have made it a fucking grease.

483
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,659
They're gonna patch this game in like a fucking two or three weeks.

484
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:20,800
They're gonna realize this is-

485
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,480
Humans couldn't do this past level 50.

486
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,380
Is it gonna go-

487
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,219
Oh, shit, we need to add like an extra half second for you

488
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:29,300
to decide what way you have to run first.

489
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:31,590
I wouldn't even pay attention.

490
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:40,769
This guy's gonna get patched.

491
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:41,329
They're gonna patch this.

492
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:41,889
They're gonna realize like,

493
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:43,570
oh, why is super hard mode in this game?

494
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,250
It's not even fucking tuned correctly.

495
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:45,889
Okay, okay.

496
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:48,679
Yeah, it's gonna be like,

497
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,880
oh, we saw the streamer of this guy,

498
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,519
German985, twitch.tv slash German985.

499
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,039
We realized our absolute faults as developers.

500
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,400
Once he got to 47, 49,

501
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,320
I mean, he's like one of the greatest gamers on the platform.

502
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:05,699
It's just not possible for people to do it.

503
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,000
So, they'll probably patch the game,

504
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,400
and then they'll realize everything was incorrect.

505
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,099
That one's so impossible.

506
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,110
You can't do that one.

507
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:44,949
Just fucking why?

508
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:54,760
This game's not built to be able to play it this fast.

509
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,789
Oh, my God.

510
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:13,840
It's not built to be able to go this fast.

511
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:19,489
Some of these fucking characters require a full second to even do anything.

512
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:49,889
Wow, Jeremy, you kind of suck, lol.

513
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,469
They're baiting me.

514
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:55,190
Don't let them bait you.

515
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,119
But like, do you understand my problem?

516
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:01,960
Like, this shit.

517
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:58,760
It's not supposed to play in this mode.

518
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,840
All right, the whole game was like tuned accordingly.

519
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,920
This one is definitely not.

520
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:08,320
Without fucking question.

521
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:33,860
I can't believe I got 40 fucking 9.

522
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:50,800
New technique.

523
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:54,659
New technique.

524
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:55,159
I'm coming.

525
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:47,900
What?

526
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:04,679
Jesus Christ, man.

527
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:09,960
Some of the characters are just not designed to play certain minigames in one full second.

528
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,400
So, a bunch of these characters are just not designed

529
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,920
to do half of these minigames in the time that Super Hard gives you.

530
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,599
You get my drift?

531
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,420
Believers crying.

532
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,360
Like, holy fucking moly, man.

533
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:50,239
That was going so well.

534
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,599
You have to have five people.

535
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,920
Like, why can't I just play it with one person?

536
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:09,719
Like, every other character on this list that's not a shooter flyer

537
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,239
requires a full second of your brain to even understand

538
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:20,840
which way you have to go to do their weird technique to complete the flip and minigame.

539
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:28,639
I almost said the F word.

540
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,019
That never happens on this channel.

541
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:40,360
I almost said it.

542
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,079
I'm really sorry.

543
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:42,599
That came really close.

544
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:31,409
But do you understand that that level in particular,

545
01:00:31,409 --> 01:00:34,610
it takes a full second for all the characters to even move the water.

546
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,130
You go slower and you have to get like out of the fuck you have to like go around.

547
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,409
It's by the time you know what you're doing, it's fucking over.

548
01:00:41,409 --> 01:01:02,039
How is it the characters suck?

549
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,690
Like, why would I put nine volt in here?

550
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,610
Let's put nine volt in here.

551
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:06,929
Watch.

552
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:09,250
Why would I ever use the shitty character?

553
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:09,969
There's no reason to.

554
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:14,929
You don't get extra gosh darn points for playing as nine volt.

555
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:15,429
What?

556
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,239
Okay.

557
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:09,739
Everyone.

558
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,420
Do you get it?

559
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,739
Do you understand why like some of these characters should never play with?

560
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,179
This should change the whole minigame.

561
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:20,630
Changes the entire minigame.

562
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,750
That's the thing about WarioWare.

563
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,469
It's got to be the same.

564
01:02:22,469 --> 01:02:25,110
So you can fucking know what the fuck you got to do when you get it in your brain.

565
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,389
Like, why would you change the whole minigame?

566
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:36,260
That's the point?

567
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:58,579
I had 40 fucking nine.

568
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:04,360
Can you get past 35?

569
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,280
Whoa, we're going down.

570
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,179
You guys lost even more confidence.

571
01:03:10,179 --> 01:03:10,659
Wait, hold on.

572
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:11,219
This one doesn't.

573
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:11,619
No, no, no, no.

574
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:12,099
This one doesn't count.

575
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:12,659
This one doesn't count.

576
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:14,980
I'm noticing that we're going down to 35.

577
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,019
You guys have lost all confidence.

578
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:17,909
This is still going.

579
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:19,110
You don't have to delete this one.

580
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,150
We're just still going.

581
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,710
I had to reset that because I can't believe that I'm being taken down.

582
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,849
That way, I'm just going to stop that one.

583
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:34,730
Now I know what I have to go for.

584
01:03:36,469 --> 01:03:48,539
It's so finicky.

585
01:03:48,539 --> 01:04:28,019
It really is.

586
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,500
Yo, damn.

587
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:27,960
Get out of the fucking train, Wario.

588
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:56,019
God, it's like some of those are just so impossible to do in that small amount of time.

589
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:44,469
It's just needing to move these motherfuckers around like that

590
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,949
and like in awkward directions.

591
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:48,070
Fuck.

592
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,300
Make it 40.

593
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,500
Like having to like analog around and then touch this little area.

594
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,019
It's just like fuck, man.

595
01:07:08,019 --> 01:07:08,739
Like this shit.

596
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,900
It's so finicky if you touch it.

597
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:11,300
It's like, wait.

598
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:27,079
That one's seriously that you can't fucking do that shit.

599
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,159
That's the stupidest one.

600
01:08:31,659 --> 01:08:33,739
It takes way longer to even get over there.

601
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:37,479
That one's so dumb.

602
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:22,739
I've won.

603
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:23,140
I got it.

604
01:09:40,329 --> 01:09:42,090
One, one, one, one, one.

605
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:42,890
What the fuck?

606
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:47,659
Why would they?

607
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,710
Dude, some of these are seriously stupid.

608
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,949
Like some of these are stupid.

609
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:15,590
Some of these are guaranteed losses.

610
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:27,880
I have to get it.

611
01:11:01,819 --> 01:11:41,850
Do you understand how some of these are stupid and they don't make any fucking sense?

612
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:12,439
Some of them are so finicky.

613
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:40,579
What the fuck are you talking about?

614
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,210
Defog, defog.

615
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,329
What do you mean?

616
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:47,930
Like I just, what?

617
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:55,260
I swear to God, some of these mini games are just dog shit.

618
01:13:55,979 --> 01:13:58,420
It's just glasses.

619
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:01,619
Morty.

620
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:11,939
Fuck that, man.

621
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,960
And how would you expect me?

622
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:18,359
I'm fine.

623
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,159
I did it.

624
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:57,239
It don't even understand what some of these want you to even do.

625
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:00,890
I feel like some of these are so strange.

626
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,010
It's like, what are you talking about?

627
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,489
Shimmy, what the fuck are you talking about?

628
01:15:05,289 --> 01:15:07,689
You have a tenth of a second to figure out what the fuck to do.

629
01:15:07,689 --> 01:15:08,810
Shimmy, what's that mean?

630
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:12,250
It doesn't mean punch person inside.

631
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:17,159
I'm throwing this one in the trash.

632
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:17,479
It's over.

633
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:25,270
When you have that few time to understand what's even going on, it can't be that like, what?

634
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:29,590
And the characters, oh, I am fucking furious right now.

635
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:52,220
It is on.

636
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:55,659
Some characters just, they, their movement doesn't even make any sense for the game at hand.

637
01:15:56,300 --> 01:16:08,340
Some of them like move faster.

638
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,220
Some of them are slow.

639
01:16:18,869 --> 01:16:24,680
This is the one.

640
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:25,800
Walk it in.

641
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,460
That one needs to be patched.

642
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,699
That one needs to be patched.

643
01:16:34,699 --> 01:16:36,539
That one needs to be patched.

644
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:38,300
That one needs to be patched.

645
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:40,760
That one needs to be.

646
01:16:41,399 --> 01:17:13,050
A poor carpenter blames his tools.

647
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:15,609
Yeah, a poor carpenter blames the tools.

648
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:19,850
If you give me like a rubber children's mallet toy to build a fucking house with.

649
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,770
My voice, it's changed.

650
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:09,770
Patch that one too.

651
01:18:10,569 --> 01:18:11,449
Patch that shit too.

652
01:18:11,449 --> 01:18:12,649
That one doesn't make no sense to me either.

653
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,359
Fill in it.

654
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:34,840
Fill in it.

655
01:18:55,289 --> 01:18:56,890
Put your fucking head over there.

656
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,670
Those ones are so stupid.

657
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:12,149
They're the worst.

658
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:04,060
No, I was trying to shoot the guy.

659
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:07,270
I was trying to.

660
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:15,460
Black.

661
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:23,460
Hang on.

662
01:20:32,539 --> 01:20:33,819
Get over there, you fucking.

663
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:07,880
This carrot.

664
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:11,640
Why couldn't I fucking break it?

665
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,250
Why couldn't I break it?

666
01:21:20,069 --> 01:21:25,109
You can't change the rules, Wario, where just you can't just change the rules like that.

667
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:32,550
A head bump breaks the fucking thing.

668
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:34,550
Don't change the rules on me.

669
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,100
I've only I didn't shoot like is the guy.

670
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,300
Oh, he only shoots this way.

671
01:21:53,779 --> 01:21:54,180
Oh, yeah.

672
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:54,739
And I draw.

673
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:55,060
Whoops.

674
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:55,539
I didn't.

675
01:21:55,539 --> 01:22:00,600
Oh, 47 again.

676
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,909
Oh, I keep coming so goddamn close.

677
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,869
Easy.

678
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:28,920
I love getting stuck on shit.

679
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,680
Great 2D character game in a Wario.

680
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:42,649
Fucking God.

681
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:45,930
Some of these are just impossible.

682
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:47,210
And I guess you have to live with that.

683
01:22:48,329 --> 01:23:03,619
It's unfucking believable because you're going to end up getting.

684
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:06,020
Eventually, you're going to end up getting one of the mini games.

685
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:09,380
That's just like not possible with the character you're playing in the super hard mode.

686
01:23:12,699 --> 01:23:14,779
You eventually going to get hit with a shitty scenario

687
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:15,979
where you can't even beat it with the guy.

688
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:48,539
I don't want to try the different characters because you like this game.

689
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:50,069
No, no, I hate it.

690
01:23:50,069 --> 01:23:51,350
Actually, I think it's the worst one.

691
01:23:52,949 --> 01:23:55,989
This is the worst game I played in the last 10 years, at least.

692
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,539
What a what a what a fucking flop.

693
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,640
Remember, guys, just call something a flop if you don't like it.

694
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,470
No, I do love this game.

695
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:23,109
I just think that it's.

696
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:28,390
I think it's fairly untuned for this particular game mode I'm trying to win.

697
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:34,329
Oh, what a fucking flop.

698
01:24:45,029 --> 01:24:47,989
I'm telling you, it's going to sell fucking less than 10,000 copies.

699
01:24:57,109 --> 01:25:01,289
All right, here we go.

700
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:57,859
Oh, what the fuck can't change the fucking rules.

701
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:04,180
You can't change the rules like I'm touching the what the fuck.

702
01:26:05,529 --> 01:26:09,050
You can't change the fucking rules if I touch it.

703
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:46,550
Three, four.

704
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:47,989
Perfect fucking character for it.

705
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:48,789
Perfect character.

706
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:57,029
Let's go.

707
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:45,979
All right.

708
01:30:45,979 --> 01:30:46,779
All right.

709
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:47,659
OK.

710
01:30:47,659 --> 01:30:55,319
OK, got 73.

711
01:30:55,319 --> 01:30:55,640
All right.

712
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,640
The game could jump back up to an 8.2.

713
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,819
It was six point.

714
01:30:59,819 --> 01:31:02,859
It was six point two and that became an 8.2 again.

715
01:31:02,859 --> 01:31:03,340
All right, good.

716
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:31,590
One more for the run.

717
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,189
One more for the road.

718
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:33,510
That's it.

719
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:40,680
I promise.

720
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,960
What a fucking flop.

721
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:45,739
What a fucking flop.

722
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:02,100
Hey, beat man.

723
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,699
Thanks for giving me these up.

724
01:32:03,699 --> 01:32:12,840
I can literally only bet 10 channel points.

725
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:13,340
Great.

726
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,260
Oh, I don't know what you did, man.

727
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,140
This is impossible.

728
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:40,600
Yeah, right.

729
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,800
No fucking way.

730
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,920
Throw that girl the trash.

731
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:15,289
I got 73 points and I have nothing to prove anymore.

732
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:15,689
I win.

733
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:21,899
That was a wicked bank some moment.

734
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,600
Sit in the chair.

735
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,319
What are you dumb?

736
01:33:28,119 --> 01:33:30,699
Couldn't get 100.

737
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:31,420
It's all right.

738
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:31,819
All right.

739
01:33:31,819 --> 01:33:35,449
Let's how I want to try.

740
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:36,729
What do you mean first place?

741
01:33:36,729 --> 01:33:40,920
Oh, I want to try this one real raw.

742
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:41,560
This is my voice.

743
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,399
Holy shit.

744
01:33:49,899 --> 01:33:51,100
I'm so glad I had cricket.

745
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,380
Cricket is the only reason why I'm still here.

746
01:33:52,939 --> 01:34:00,310
Check the leaderboard.

747
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:01,350
Oh, that's probably a daily game.

748
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:01,989
You're right.

749
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:02,789
This game is really good.

750
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,770
What?

751
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:15,659
I don't change the rules again.

752
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,279
Game over.

753
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,140
I'm not going to get 100.

754
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:22,859
No fucking way.

755
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:24,060
I'm not putting that on me.

756
01:34:24,619 --> 01:34:27,989
The title of this stream is 50.

757
01:34:27,989 --> 01:34:28,789
I'm not doing 100.

758
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:40,869
These are very hard.

759
01:34:45,529 --> 01:34:46,649
Although I have time, though.

760
01:34:47,289 --> 01:34:50,939
Oh, I feel like I'm playing a comp.

761
01:34:50,939 --> 01:34:52,300
I feel like I'm in slow motion.

762
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:00,260
I don't understand.

763
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:02,119
Now I do.

764
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:07,020
I feel like I'm talking in slow motion, too,

765
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:09,020
as I was going too fast before.

766
01:35:09,819 --> 01:35:11,319
See what I mean?

767
01:35:12,279 --> 01:35:13,640
Everything is too slow.

768
01:35:20,069 --> 01:35:21,350
Oh, that's weird.

769
01:35:22,069 --> 01:35:25,189
I've been on x10 speed for the last hour and a half.

770
01:35:25,989 --> 01:35:30,260
Both of them don't fail.

771
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:38,140
Holy shit.

772
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:38,699
These are hard.

773
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:40,119
All right.

774
01:35:40,119 --> 01:35:41,720
I'm going to try to get 20 on this one.

775
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:42,520
20, I'll be happy.

776
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:50,020
Then I'm going to spend a bunch of my money and leave.

777
01:35:53,210 --> 01:36:06,500
I'll be happy with 20.

778
01:36:29,289 --> 01:36:30,090
Holy shit.

779
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:34,010
Oh.

780
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:59,189
Oh, funny.

781
01:36:59,189 --> 01:36:59,750
Got it.

782
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:00,390
That was tough.

783
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:10,739
I, this is the, this is why I don't like the game.

784
01:37:10,739 --> 01:37:12,659
I don't like when they make you move and you have to.

785
01:37:13,939 --> 01:37:15,779
Like, you have to move in every one of these mini games

786
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:17,939
and it's just like, fuck, I moved a little bit and I did that.

787
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:18,420
I ended it.

788
01:37:20,619 --> 01:37:21,119
Last round.

789
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:28,420
Like, I start every one of these ready to go.

790
01:37:33,289 --> 01:37:33,789
Grab it.

791
01:37:44,569 --> 01:37:47,880
Now we're doing this one ASMR.

792
01:37:48,439 --> 01:37:51,880
Okay.

793
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:57,210
Today, I'm replaying WarioWare for the Nintendo Switch.

794
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:00,630
And I'm going to be, relax you.

795
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:02,069
I'm going to be really relaxing for you.

796
01:38:02,630 --> 01:38:03,029
Okay.

797
01:38:03,029 --> 01:38:05,270
So what we're going to do here is I'm going to try to get these things.

798
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,630
And exactly what I'm going to do here is I'm going to get this thing here.

799
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:09,590
The pill has been unveiled.

800
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:11,350
It's impossible.

801
01:38:12,569 --> 01:38:13,689
Literally not completable.

802
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:15,529
It's literally not completable.

803
01:38:16,729 --> 01:38:18,569
I was going to scream, but I don't want to do that.

804
01:38:18,569 --> 01:38:20,649
All right.

805
01:38:20,649 --> 01:38:21,149
One more try.

806
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:33,350
What kind of ASMR do you listen to?

807
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:33,850
I don't.

808
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:43,060
Anyway, that, that looks good right now.

809
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:45,140
Is that avocado toast with an egg on it?

810
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:45,939
Scrumptious.

811
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,739
That sounds good to me.

812
01:38:50,739 --> 01:38:52,180
Scrumdiddlyumptious.

813
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:04,810
What?

814
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:07,189
That's what you guys are upset about now?

815
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:10,470
Is me saying that avocado toast looks scrumdiddlyumptious?

816
01:39:12,869 --> 01:39:16,069
That's, that's what you want to say is the thing you don't like?

817
01:39:19,029 --> 01:39:19,909
It was awful.

818
01:39:19,909 --> 01:39:21,189
I, no, it wasn't.

819
01:39:23,289 --> 01:39:24,010
Holy shit.

820
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:24,970
I think it's pink.

821
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:27,770
Yeah, it's pink.

822
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,899
Are they calling me Ned Flanders?

823
01:39:56,600 --> 01:40:00,500
Oh, how am I Ned Flanders?

824
01:40:03,989 --> 01:40:06,229
Oh, they move across the screen.

825
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:07,029
Of course they do.

826
01:40:07,029 --> 01:40:07,529
One more.

827
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:09,270
All right.

828
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:09,770
I'm done.

829
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,890
One more.

830
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:12,869
One more and then I'm going to feed my friends.

831
01:40:25,739 --> 01:40:26,699
I would not be betting on this.

832
01:40:26,699 --> 01:40:28,619
I have not had any experience with half these minigames.

833
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:36,300
Why would you be betting on this?

834
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:41,739
What?

835
01:40:41,739 --> 01:40:42,380
I don't get it.

836
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:45,640
Last one.

837
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:51,189
Trap two.

838
01:40:51,189 --> 01:40:51,510
Do I wait?

839
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:54,949
Do I have to trap two individual or trap them both at the same time?

840
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:57,989
Got to be more clear about that, please.

841
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:05,640
Stop betting.

842
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:06,520
What's wrong with you guys?

843
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,300
Oh, shit.

844
01:41:29,899 --> 01:41:31,640
Holy moly.

845
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,760
That was hard.

846
01:41:33,319 --> 01:41:34,119
One more.

847
01:41:34,119 --> 01:41:36,600
This is actually the last one.

848
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,239
I swear to God.

849
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,699
I'm getting 20 on this one.

850
01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:41,979
I would bet on this one if I were you.

851
01:41:41,979 --> 01:41:42,859
I'm telling you, I would do it.

852
01:41:43,979 --> 01:41:48,760
If I were in the chat right now, I would bet that I was going to get 20.

853
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:49,260
I'm just saying.

854
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:08,250
I look like my face at the end.

855
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:46,010
What?

856
01:42:47,029 --> 01:42:52,010
Wouldn't that be the big one and the small one?

857
01:42:58,489 --> 01:42:59,529
I'll do this one with no lips.

858
01:43:01,659 --> 01:43:02,300
I'm going to be better.

859
01:43:02,779 --> 01:43:08,380
Finish.

860
01:43:13,539 --> 01:43:14,899
One kernel.

861
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:22,899
Oh, my God.

862
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:29,939
Empty.

863
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:38,750
Finish.

864
01:43:43,899 --> 01:43:47,750
Seek shelter.

865
01:43:48,789 --> 01:43:54,149
It's me.

866
01:43:55,029 --> 01:43:56,279
Watch out.

867
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:09,359
Hence.

868
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:27,720
Great.

869
01:44:44,229 --> 01:44:44,729
Yo.

870
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:45,390
Yo.

871
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:51,680
Some of these.

872
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,399
Throw them in the trash.

873
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:53,840
Remove them.

874
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,399
Just get rid of them.

875
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:55,539
Wrong way.

876
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:57,180
Last one.

877
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:01,960
Some of those are stupid.

878
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:02,600
Just throw them away.

879
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,479
They don't even need to be in the game.

880
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:03,979
They're dumb.

881
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:17,819
You don't get to eat?

882
01:45:17,819 --> 01:45:18,619
What's up with that?

883
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:22,119
I'm trying to make it to 20.

884
01:45:23,739 --> 01:45:24,859
I don't have to make it to 20.

885
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:26,060
I don't care.

886
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:28,109
I really don't even care.

887
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:30,270
I don't care.

888
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:30,989
I don't even care.

889
01:45:33,229 --> 01:45:33,949
Oh, my God.

890
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:35,630
Oh, my God.

891
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:36,510
These people think I care.

892
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:37,310
You think I care?

893
01:45:38,189 --> 01:45:40,840
I was trying to...

894
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:41,800
Oh, I can jump up there.

895
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:51,869
These people in the chat think I care.

896
01:45:51,869 --> 01:45:52,989
I don't even fucking care.

897
01:45:54,989 --> 01:45:55,789
Holy shit, dude.

898
01:45:55,789 --> 01:45:57,310
Like, I don't give a shit.

899
01:45:57,310 --> 01:45:57,810
I don't care.

900
01:45:58,989 --> 01:46:07,840
Oh, well, I'll be having pasta today.

901
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:25,369
End the stream if you don't care.

902
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:26,409
That's the thing.

903
01:46:26,409 --> 01:46:27,689
That's the way you don't get.

904
01:46:27,689 --> 01:46:30,170
I don't care enough about the stream,

905
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:32,090
and I don't care about not streaming for me to care.

906
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:34,619
Are you serious?

907
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:36,970
I don't care about not streaming.

908
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:38,010
I don't care about streaming either.

909
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:38,810
So what?

910
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:39,609
Balls in your court.

911
01:46:40,409 --> 01:46:45,399
It's a big bunny.

912
01:46:50,329 --> 01:46:51,369
Pink did not win.

913
01:46:51,369 --> 01:46:51,869
Wait.

914
01:46:52,699 --> 01:46:53,899
Oh, I think I got baited here.

915
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:56,130
Yeah.

916
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:57,149
No.

917
01:46:57,149 --> 01:47:03,630
Perfect character for this.

918
01:47:04,270 --> 01:47:06,590
One, two, three, four, five.

919
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:12,590
Oh, he didn't even care.

920
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:13,229
No, I don't even care.

921
01:47:20,199 --> 01:47:20,920
Fucking frog.

922
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:39,420
I don't even care.

923
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:48,439
Oh, wait.

924
01:47:56,590 --> 01:47:57,390
I'm so addicted.

925
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:58,109
I can't stop.

926
01:47:58,109 --> 01:47:58,750
I know.

927
01:47:58,750 --> 01:47:59,869
I'm having fun.

928
01:47:59,869 --> 01:48:03,630
How am I supposed to tell the difference?

929
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:13,319
I talked a lot of shit today, but I'm not even serious.

930
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:14,600
I don't care.

931
01:48:18,590 --> 01:48:31,130
Hold on.

932
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:31,850
I can do better than this.

933
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:03,630
Shut up.

934
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:08,800
I could have gone for so much longer.

935
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,479
I think people really actually hated that.

936
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:16,510
I could have gone for like another 30 to 40 full seconds.

937
01:49:19,369 --> 01:49:23,770
I started seeing way more stop than way more cool, dude.

938
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:35,000
All right.

939
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,119
Let's go feed our friends.

940
01:49:36,119 --> 01:49:47,159
So that was WarioWare.

941
01:49:47,159 --> 01:49:48,039
That was really fun.

942
01:49:48,039 --> 01:50:04,350
Ooh, legendary.

943
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:06,649
Come on.

944
01:50:06,649 --> 01:50:08,890
I only got one legendary the whole time.

945
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:10,890
It's kind of horse shit.

946
01:50:11,449 --> 01:50:17,359
Come on.

947
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:22,189
Legendary.

948
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:36,189
All right.

949
01:50:36,189 --> 01:50:36,829
Wario.

950
01:50:36,829 --> 01:50:37,869
Let's give you a present.

951
01:50:37,869 --> 01:50:43,100
I'm going to assume that Wario probably likes the thing with the Wario truck.

952
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:44,560
Right?

953
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,279
He didn't like it.

954
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:55,600
Why wouldn't you like the truck with your face on it?

955
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:14,699
I know he likes meat and you have mission points, too.

956
01:51:14,699 --> 01:51:15,020
Oh, shit.

957
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:15,819
That's right.

958
01:51:15,819 --> 01:51:18,189
All right.

959
01:51:18,189 --> 01:51:18,750
Let's go to...

960
01:51:20,109 --> 01:51:21,470
Orbeeline.

961
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:21,869
What do you got?

962
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:30,000
What does Orbe...

963
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,239
The bowling pin, right?

964
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:32,720
Yeah.

965
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:46,840
I don't think Wario is capable of driving.

966
01:51:47,479 --> 01:51:56,600
Okay.

967
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,319
Who wants the truck?

968
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:04,430
All right.

969
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:05,229
What about Mike?

970
01:52:05,229 --> 01:52:10,090
Or for the guitar, right?

971
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,329
His favorite thing.

972
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:14,140
That's a lot of points.

973
01:52:17,869 --> 01:52:18,750
I got a mission for that.

974
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:24,590
Music related.

975
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:25,550
Performance related.

976
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:26,270
Music related.

977
01:52:26,829 --> 01:52:30,720
I don't think anything else here.

978
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:40,159
We have a lot of sports stuff.

979
01:52:44,270 --> 01:52:45,229
Baseball.

980
01:52:45,229 --> 01:52:49,399
Take the baby off.

981
01:52:49,399 --> 01:52:49,640
I will.

982
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,920
I'll take it off.

983
01:52:50,920 --> 01:53:00,029
You get mission rewards at level 15 for everybody.

984
01:53:00,029 --> 01:53:00,430
Oh, shit.

985
01:53:00,430 --> 01:53:01,229
That's good to know.

986
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:12,539
Any more sports?

987
01:53:12,539 --> 01:53:17,449
I don't think so.

988
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,640
Boxing, though?

989
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:25,979
All right.

990
01:53:25,979 --> 01:53:26,460
What about you?

991
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:28,880
Wedding dress, right?

992
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:29,119
Yep.

993
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:38,890
Okay.

994
01:53:39,529 --> 01:53:40,729
Yeah, well, I'm going to look at all this stuff.

995
01:53:40,729 --> 01:53:41,050
Don't worry.

996
01:53:43,390 --> 01:53:44,590
What about this red gem?

997
01:53:45,229 --> 01:53:49,680
It's literally her favorite thing.

998
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:50,800
Nice.

999
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,199
Got it.

1000
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:57,560
Okay.

1001
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:04,109
What about birthday cake?

1002
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:04,909
Yeah.

1003
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:06,270
I got three of these.

1004
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:15,479
Mood change from the beginning of the stream to now?

1005
01:54:16,039 --> 01:54:17,710
I mean, what?

1006
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:18,189
I mean, I...

1007
01:54:18,189 --> 01:54:18,829
Oh, football.

1008
01:54:18,829 --> 01:54:19,069
Mike.

1009
01:54:19,869 --> 01:54:22,159
No, not Mike.

1010
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:22,560
Jimmy.

1011
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:25,439
What?

1012
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:28,800
I didn't go on an absolute tirade and tell you guys that this is literally...

1013
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,520
The game's awful and it was a 6 out of 10 and it was a flop.

1014
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,479
It was going to flop.

1015
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:37,180
It's just venting.

1016
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:38,779
It doesn't mean anything.

1017
01:54:38,779 --> 01:54:39,979
I'm not actually saying that.

1018
01:54:42,199 --> 01:54:42,920
I like this game.

1019
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:43,640
I think it's really good.

1020
01:54:44,359 --> 01:54:45,689
It's not a flop.

1021
01:54:45,689 --> 01:54:46,090
It's good.

1022
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:47,979
What'd I say, though?

1023
01:54:47,979 --> 01:54:49,659
It's the worst game to come out in the last 10 years.

1024
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:51,819
That's not...

1025
01:54:51,819 --> 01:54:53,100
I mean, you know that's not even accurate.

1026
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:54,060
How could that be accurate?

1027
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:56,880
All right.

1028
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,319
What about video game-related stuff?

1029
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:07,949
I don't know if he's going to like any of this.

1030
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:17,340
Who's construction?

1031
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:19,979
Trigor?

1032
01:55:22,489 --> 01:55:23,529
Give Ashley food?

1033
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:34,199
I mean, Ashley and Wari were like red meat or something.

1034
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:41,289
Okay.

1035
01:55:41,289 --> 01:55:42,170
What about...

1036
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:43,289
I mean, what is this, like, sushi?

1037
01:55:46,109 --> 01:55:47,789
Ashley's favorite thing is sushi.

1038
01:55:47,789 --> 01:55:48,590
That's her favorite food.

1039
01:55:49,229 --> 01:55:49,880
I don't know.

1040
01:55:50,439 --> 01:55:53,550
Okay.

1041
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:54,270
What about mushrooms?

1042
01:55:55,390 --> 01:55:55,949
Holy shit.

1043
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:56,829
You like those, too.

1044
01:55:56,829 --> 01:55:57,149
All right.

1045
01:55:57,869 --> 01:56:06,039
Okay.

1046
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:10,329
What about like an afternoon tea?

1047
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:11,949
All right.

1048
01:56:11,949 --> 01:56:12,189
Yeah.

1049
01:56:12,829 --> 01:56:18,960
Scallion?

1050
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:24,189
Boiled egg?

1051
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:26,239
Don't like eggs.

1052
01:56:28,729 --> 01:56:29,130
Candy?

1053
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:30,170
Yeah.

1054
01:56:31,449 --> 01:56:31,850
Grapes?

1055
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:34,649
Yeah.

1056
01:56:34,649 --> 01:56:35,210
Love grapes.

1057
01:56:35,770 --> 01:56:39,100
Why do you look like that?

1058
01:56:39,739 --> 01:56:40,569
I don't know.

1059
01:56:40,569 --> 01:56:41,609
Ask my mother.

1060
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:47,100
Is this kind of food?

1061
01:56:47,739 --> 01:56:49,800
Oh, tuna fish.

1062
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:50,359
Are you kidding me?

1063
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:51,500
Yep.

1064
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:54,729
Little 15, right?

1065
01:56:57,229 --> 01:56:57,470
All right.

1066
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:57,949
Almost there.

1067
01:56:58,510 --> 01:57:04,439
How about...

1068
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:10,909
How about one of these?

1069
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:12,699
Okay.

1070
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:17,880
All right.

1071
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:18,680
I'm done with Ashley.

1072
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:24,510
Come on.

1073
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:25,470
We're going to go through all these people.

1074
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:25,789
Don't worry.

1075
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:28,109
What about red?

1076
01:57:28,829 --> 01:57:31,470
Don't you just want to make the devil...

1077
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:32,909
Don't you just want to make the devil mad?

1078
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:34,409
Okay.

1079
01:57:34,409 --> 01:57:34,649
Wait.

1080
01:57:34,649 --> 01:57:35,369
Jimmy's close.

1081
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:37,520
Obi-Wan is close.

1082
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:39,260
All right.

1083
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:40,140
Crygor is close.

1084
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:43,960
How about...

1085
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:44,199
I'm going to...

1086
01:57:44,199 --> 01:57:44,359
Okay.

1087
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:45,159
I'm going to give him the crane.

1088
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,159
I'm going to give Crygor the crane.

1089
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:58,909
What about the...

1090
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:01,239
You like these.

1091
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:13,340
Helicopter?

1092
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:13,819
No.

1093
01:58:13,819 --> 01:58:14,220
Painting.

1094
01:58:17,739 --> 01:58:18,539
Loves it.

1095
01:58:18,539 --> 01:58:18,699
All right.

1096
01:58:18,699 --> 01:58:20,680
We got him to 15.

1097
01:58:27,310 --> 01:58:28,350
Nine volt?

1098
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:29,710
Likes the construction stuff?

1099
01:58:30,350 --> 01:58:30,960
All right.

1100
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,000
Like, here's a helicopter.

1101
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,699
He's a little kid.

1102
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:40,489
That means you're going to like the truck, too, then, right?

1103
01:58:45,449 --> 01:58:46,329
Bicycle.

1104
01:58:46,329 --> 01:58:47,050
The toy truck.

1105
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:49,319
The shoes.

1106
01:58:50,039 --> 01:58:52,159
The sunglasses, maybe.

1107
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:55,260
Not a...

1108
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:56,140
Probably not a cell phone.

1109
01:58:57,869 --> 01:58:58,109
Yeah.

1110
01:58:58,109 --> 01:58:58,829
Okay.

1111
01:58:58,829 --> 01:59:05,420
I'm not giving him the toilet.

1112
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:07,770
I don't think that's accurate.

1113
01:59:08,329 --> 01:59:10,510
He loves bikes.

1114
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:16,670
Definitely the high-tech shoes.

1115
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:17,229
That's for sure.

1116
01:59:17,949 --> 01:59:21,260
Yeah.

1117
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:22,439
All right.

1118
01:59:22,439 --> 01:59:22,760
Come on.

1119
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:23,000
We...

1120
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:23,960
I'm just going to give him the toilet.

1121
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:25,899
He loves it.

1122
01:59:26,539 --> 01:59:28,720
All right.

1123
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:29,760
I don't want to spend any more on him.

1124
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:30,239
He's 15.

1125
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:37,359
So who else likes the toilet that's not 15?

1126
01:59:39,579 --> 01:59:40,539
It's definitely Wario.

1127
01:59:40,539 --> 01:59:41,020
Has to be.

1128
01:59:41,659 --> 01:59:53,930
That's 14.

1129
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:00,489
And we're just going to use...

1130
02:00:00,489 --> 02:00:01,449
Remember the boxing glove?

1131
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:04,510
Wait.

1132
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:05,789
I thought Wario liked to punch people.

1133
02:00:08,729 --> 02:00:09,930
Mustache catalog.

1134
02:00:09,930 --> 02:00:10,409
Yep.

1135
02:00:10,409 --> 02:00:12,539
I just got to get him to 15.

1136
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:17,680
Wario 15.

1137
02:00:21,789 --> 02:00:24,189
Ah, just give him the other one, so he cares.

1138
02:00:24,189 --> 02:00:27,439
Okay.

1139
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:30,220
So these remaining ones.

1140
02:00:30,939 --> 02:00:33,550
How about cricket?

1141
02:00:34,109 --> 02:00:36,859
How about deer scare?

1142
02:00:37,739 --> 02:00:38,619
This is soothing.

1143
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:42,140
He didn't hate it, but he didn't love it.

1144
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:47,000
Dumbbells?

1145
02:00:50,649 --> 02:00:51,369
Like training?

1146
02:00:52,010 --> 02:01:04,319
You're obsessed?

1147
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:05,760
I mean, I'm just having fun, man.

1148
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:09,180
Didn't like that one.

1149
02:01:09,819 --> 02:01:13,180
We'll just eat the apple core because nobody wants that.

1150
02:01:13,899 --> 02:01:17,500
What about the camera?

1151
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,399
Oh, he doesn't like cameras at all.

1152
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:20,960
He hates them.

1153
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,340
All right.

1154
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:24,300
Who would like a camera?

1155
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:29,399
Mona?

1156
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:37,720
All right.

1157
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:40,439
Well, Mona, you're just literally getting all the rest of the items.

1158
02:01:40,439 --> 02:01:41,960
Because then I'm going to go get more money.

1159
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:45,609
You like manhole covers?

1160
02:01:46,329 --> 02:01:48,489
Okay.

1161
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:03,869
Ooh.

1162
02:02:03,869 --> 02:02:04,189
All right.

1163
02:02:04,189 --> 02:02:05,310
You like the glasses.

1164
02:02:05,310 --> 02:02:10,829
What about the cactus?

1165
02:02:10,829 --> 02:02:13,819
She seems to have liked everything so far.

1166
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:16,430
She just likes everything.

1167
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:18,829
Okay.

1168
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:20,800
All right.

1169
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:23,520
I need to go complete my quest so I get a shitload more money.

1170
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:27,930
So I'm going to go back and complete my quest.

1171
02:02:28,489 --> 02:02:29,739
All right.

1172
02:02:29,739 --> 02:02:31,449
What have I got?

1173
02:02:31,449 --> 02:02:32,409
Oh my goodness.

1174
02:02:32,409 --> 02:02:33,130
Look at all this money.

1175
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:35,770
I haven't come back to my quest rewards.

1176
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:37,289
It's in like four hours of gameplay.

1177
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:42,430
Unlock all games.

1178
02:02:43,579 --> 02:02:44,619
I haven't done this once.

1179
02:02:50,619 --> 02:02:51,420
Oh, hell yeah.

1180
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:51,739
All right.

1181
02:02:53,159 --> 02:02:54,039
Score?

1182
02:02:54,039 --> 02:02:56,279
I have to have gotten something for doing 50.

1183
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:04,199
Play high tech and story with the crew free earn at least 31.

1184
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:07,789
Okay.

1185
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:12,159
I'm going to score 46 or higher.

1186
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,920
Play thrill ride with the crew five or at least 10 or higher.

1187
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,439
I got to 50 in the other one.

1188
02:03:22,439 --> 02:03:23,000
Are you kidding me?

1189
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:27,550
46 not 50.

1190
02:03:27,550 --> 02:03:27,869
Okay.

1191
02:03:27,869 --> 02:03:28,350
Well, whatever.

1192
02:03:28,989 --> 02:03:36,880
Clear it after spilling 30 pieces of food.

1193
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:38,569
Okay.

1194
02:03:38,569 --> 02:03:39,289
Troll the credits.

1195
02:03:39,289 --> 02:03:40,409
I don't want to.

1196
02:03:40,409 --> 02:03:41,279
All right.

1197
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:41,680
Here we go.

1198
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:42,159
Ooh.

1199
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:43,520
Make Wario head honcho.

1200
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:45,039
Holy shit.

1201
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:48,649
Oh boy.

1202
02:03:48,649 --> 02:03:49,050
Oh boy.

1203
02:03:54,279 --> 02:03:54,600
Okay.

1204
02:03:55,159 --> 02:04:00,119
I mean, I've got 25,000 bucks.

1205
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:07,229
I'm not.

1206
02:04:07,229 --> 02:04:07,630
No, no, no.

1207
02:04:07,869 --> 02:04:09,229
We're going to open 10 times.

1208
02:04:09,229 --> 02:04:16,439
Whereas do some legendaries.

1209
02:04:17,239 --> 02:04:21,199
I'll take it.

1210
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:32,029
Come on.

1211
02:04:34,119 --> 02:04:34,840
Legendary.

1212
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:35,720
Five stars.

1213
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:36,840
Five stars.

1214
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:57,310
What the fuck?

1215
02:05:07,399 --> 02:05:07,800
Yes.

1216
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:10,060
I got a crown.

1217
02:05:10,060 --> 02:05:11,979
Five star golden crown.

1218
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:15,680
That's going to be big money.

1219
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:18,989
What a whale.

1220
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:24,010
All right.

1221
02:05:24,010 --> 02:05:24,890
Let's do it.

1222
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:26,329
I'm ready to level up again.

1223
02:05:26,329 --> 02:05:27,689
And now I'm going to level up other people to 15.

1224
02:05:27,689 --> 02:05:29,770
We're going to the cycle continues for at least another 10 minutes.

1225
02:05:33,869 --> 02:05:34,430
All right.

1226
02:05:34,430 --> 02:05:36,029
Who wants the golden crown?

1227
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:42,510
Okay.

1228
02:05:42,510 --> 02:05:43,390
You need to get to 15.

1229
02:05:46,970 --> 02:05:47,930
Expensive vase.

1230
02:05:49,159 --> 02:05:49,720
Wario.

1231
02:05:50,439 --> 02:05:51,239
A real head turner.

1232
02:05:51,239 --> 02:05:53,239
Great for folks with a take charge attitude.

1233
02:05:58,029 --> 02:05:58,909
Well, I know you like.

1234
02:05:58,909 --> 02:05:59,869
No, you don't like this.

1235
02:05:59,869 --> 02:06:00,430
What do you like?

1236
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,960
You like dumbbells.

1237
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:08,909
It's going to be Wario.

1238
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:21,039
Ashley.

1239
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,039
Wario is already 15 though.

1240
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,319
In the soccer ball.

1241
02:06:30,439 --> 02:06:30,760
Yeah.

1242
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:31,239
He likes it.

1243
02:06:43,479 --> 02:06:48,029
What about the boxing glove?

1244
02:06:55,439 --> 02:06:56,079
Almost 15.

1245
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:02,159
Afternoon tea.

1246
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:04,140
No, isn't like it.

1247
02:07:05,819 --> 02:07:06,060
All right.

1248
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:06,779
What about sushi?

1249
02:07:06,779 --> 02:07:08,300
No, what about high tech shoes?

1250
02:07:16,909 --> 02:07:17,550
Anything else?

1251
02:07:18,109 --> 02:07:24,029
I really want to get him to 15.

1252
02:07:25,449 --> 02:07:25,850
Football.

1253
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:32,520
Golden egg.

1254
02:07:33,239 --> 02:07:37,369
He doesn't like sushi.

1255
02:07:37,369 --> 02:07:38,250
Ashley likes sushi.

1256
02:07:39,789 --> 02:07:40,270
Baseball.

1257
02:07:40,909 --> 02:07:45,880
Give him a vase.

1258
02:07:46,439 --> 02:07:47,600
I'll try the vase.

1259
02:07:53,850 --> 02:07:54,939
That was incorrect.

1260
02:07:57,229 --> 02:07:57,949
Worth a shot though.

1261
02:07:57,949 --> 02:07:58,189
All right.

1262
02:07:58,189 --> 02:07:59,310
What about the electric guitar?

1263
02:08:00,029 --> 02:08:03,289
That's all right.

1264
02:08:03,289 --> 02:08:04,090
We got our 2000.

1265
02:08:12,939 --> 02:08:13,180
All right.

1266
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:14,140
What about Jimmy?

1267
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:17,560
Headphones.

1268
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:31,789
Crown.

1269
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:37,199
Oh.

1270
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:46,359
Well, there we go.

1271
02:08:50,189 --> 02:08:51,789
That was actually his favorite thing.

1272
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:55,800
All right.

1273
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,920
Now, what about some of these others?

1274
02:08:57,479 --> 02:08:57,960
We've got...

1275
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:00,279
Orbulon is level seven.

1276
02:09:00,279 --> 02:09:00,840
Do I have anything?

1277
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:02,520
I got some of their bowling pins, right?

1278
02:09:03,159 --> 02:09:09,739
Jimmy just clogged out of his mind.

1279
02:09:09,739 --> 02:09:09,979
Yep.

1280
02:09:10,619 --> 02:09:14,829
You like these?

1281
02:09:14,829 --> 02:09:15,069
No.

1282
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:17,500
You like these.

1283
02:09:25,310 --> 02:09:27,229
How can I get you to 15?

1284
02:09:27,869 --> 02:09:33,210
Toilet.

1285
02:09:33,210 --> 02:09:35,039
I have two toilets.

1286
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:35,359
Let's see.

1287
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:42,670
I think I'm thinking the vase.

1288
02:09:43,229 --> 02:09:45,529
I'm going.

1289
02:09:45,529 --> 02:09:46,329
I'm going vase.

1290
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:49,979
No, it's not worth it.

1291
02:09:49,979 --> 02:09:50,460
It's not worth it.

1292
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:51,579
Camera.

1293
02:09:52,220 --> 02:09:59,359
Iggy bank.

1294
02:09:59,359 --> 02:10:00,079
No, that's Wario.

1295
02:10:02,409 --> 02:10:02,890
Golden egg.

1296
02:10:03,529 --> 02:10:06,600
Got it.

1297
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:10,880
Oh, we're going to have even more money to spend.

1298
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:11,920
I can't wait.

1299
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:17,550
Okay.

1300
02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:18,430
15.

1301
02:10:18,430 --> 02:10:19,630
What about these guys?

1302
02:10:19,630 --> 02:10:20,510
Oh, Mona.

1303
02:10:20,510 --> 02:10:21,149
All right.

1304
02:10:21,149 --> 02:10:21,869
What about Mona?

1305
02:10:23,869 --> 02:10:24,670
Cabin crews.

1306
02:10:36,729 --> 02:10:37,369
Wedding dress.

1307
02:10:39,279 --> 02:10:39,760
Oh, yeah.

1308
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:45,479
Do that again.

1309
02:10:46,039 --> 02:10:52,140
And the manhole cover.

1310
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:52,539
That's right.

1311
02:10:52,539 --> 02:10:53,500
I'm not even going to need to use it.

1312
02:10:54,220 --> 02:11:00,520
Who else is close?

1313
02:11:01,079 --> 02:11:01,319
All right.

1314
02:11:01,319 --> 02:11:02,039
You're 15.

1315
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,520
Anybody else have more than level one?

1316
02:11:11,229 --> 02:11:11,550
No.

1317
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:12,029
All right.

1318
02:11:12,029 --> 02:11:12,670
Let's go with...

1319
02:11:13,630 --> 02:11:15,560
A penny.

1320
02:11:16,279 --> 02:11:19,119
What should I do?

1321
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:24,159
Red.

1322
02:11:25,359 --> 02:11:25,920
Do you like...

1323
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:27,359
Bases?

1324
02:11:28,159 --> 02:11:41,199
Do you like helicopters?

1325
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:47,279
Maybe because helicopters fly?

1326
02:11:48,319 --> 02:11:51,560
All right.

1327
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:52,359
Level nine.

1328
02:11:52,359 --> 02:11:53,239
And why don't you take the crane?

1329
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,109
Why do you like construction material?

1330
02:11:56,109 --> 02:11:56,430
All right.

1331
02:11:57,069 --> 02:12:02,239
He likes vehicles.

1332
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:05,289
Fine.

1333
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:07,399
You just got him to a little 15.

1334
02:12:08,039 --> 02:12:10,680
Give me red meat.

1335
02:12:14,859 --> 02:12:16,539
And apple core.

1336
02:12:18,829 --> 02:12:19,869
He likes the apple core.

1337
02:12:20,430 --> 02:12:22,960
All right.

1338
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:23,359
15.

1339
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:29,760
Who else?

1340
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:33,710
Penny?

1341
02:12:36,729 --> 02:12:37,689
Penny, do you like a toilet?

1342
02:12:38,989 --> 02:12:39,229
Yeah.

1343
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:48,649
I just got to...

1344
02:12:48,649 --> 02:12:50,250
I'm going to feed Penny literally everything.

1345
02:12:50,890 --> 02:12:51,770
Even if she doesn't like it.

1346
02:12:54,079 --> 02:12:54,399
Because...

1347
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,359
I need to get somebody else 15 so I give them money.

1348
02:13:05,239 --> 02:13:05,720
Come on.

1349
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:06,920
You're going to like one of these, right?

1350
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,039
Come on.

1351
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:12,300
I'm going to sleep for seven hours.

1352
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:12,619
Holy shit.

1353
02:13:12,619 --> 02:13:13,819
This is abnormal.

1354
02:13:15,819 --> 02:13:16,779
Likes tea?

1355
02:13:16,779 --> 02:13:17,500
I'm not going to make it.

1356
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:20,520
Come on.

1357
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:21,720
I'm not going to make it.

1358
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:22,600
Level 13.

1359
02:13:26,890 --> 02:13:27,449
Come on.

1360
02:13:30,729 --> 02:13:31,289
Come on.

1361
02:13:31,289 --> 02:13:31,930
One more level.

1362
02:13:32,970 --> 02:13:33,880
I'll get it.

1363
02:13:42,329 --> 02:13:42,890
Got it.

1364
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:43,369
15.

1365
02:13:46,619 --> 02:13:47,500
How interesting.

1366
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:48,699
Ha ha.

1367
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:53,000
I'm just winding down, man.

1368
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:56,600
I'm just like blinking like a hundred times when I say a sentence.

1369
02:13:57,239 --> 02:13:59,130
All right.

1370
02:13:59,130 --> 02:13:59,529
Let's go.

1371
02:14:01,529 --> 02:14:02,010
Where am I going?

1372
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:02,250
Okay.

1373
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:02,489
Here.

1374
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:07,960
Money.

1375
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:26,270
Give us more legendaries.

1376
02:14:26,989 --> 02:14:32,489
I want like...

1377
02:14:32,489 --> 02:14:34,409
Give me like four legendaries right now.

1378
02:14:34,409 --> 02:14:38,479
All right.

1379
02:14:38,479 --> 02:14:39,439
That's the last time I can do that.

1380
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:44,909
I'm hungry.

1381
02:14:44,909 --> 02:14:45,390
Let's go eat.

1382
02:14:53,229 --> 02:14:54,510
Family guy whale.

1383
02:15:06,199 --> 02:15:06,680
Nice.

1384
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:07,319
Come on.

1385
02:15:07,319 --> 02:15:08,119
Legendary.

1386
02:15:08,119 --> 02:15:15,979
All right.

1387
02:15:15,979 --> 02:15:16,460
Last chance.

1388
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:25,960
It's all right.

1389
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:28,779
It's all right.

1390
02:15:28,779 --> 02:15:32,539
I can't afford any of this.

1391
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:36,430
Oh, there is actually one more thing I want to do.

1392
02:15:37,149 --> 02:15:39,850
All right.

1393
02:15:39,850 --> 02:15:40,569
So what do we got now?

1394
02:15:41,289 --> 02:15:44,010
We have Ashley likes one of these, right?

1395
02:15:44,729 --> 02:15:53,229
Yeah, the meat and the sushi.

1396
02:15:53,869 --> 02:15:55,550
Yeah.

1397
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:56,510
I'm going to check out all the new art.

1398
02:15:57,149 --> 02:15:58,600
Curry sounds amazing right now.

1399
02:15:58,600 --> 02:15:58,920
Thank you.

1400
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:03,130
I don't know.

1401
02:16:03,770 --> 02:16:04,250
Maybe not.

1402
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:09,579
Orbulon.

1403
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:15,899
Five volt.

1404
02:16:19,149 --> 02:16:19,710
Nine volt.

1405
02:16:19,710 --> 02:16:20,270
I can get up.

1406
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:22,600
Nine volt loves this shit.

1407
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:32,079
Give 18 volt the laptop.

1408
02:16:33,709 --> 02:16:43,799
Oh, yeah.

1409
02:16:43,799 --> 02:16:44,680
Do you like anything else?

1410
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:52,280
No, he likes it.

1411
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:56,989
Did you get gold in the Wario Cup?

1412
02:16:56,989 --> 02:16:58,030
Um, I didn't even...

1413
02:16:58,030 --> 02:16:59,069
I don't think I even really played it.

1414
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:10,569
What's the point of raising the levels?

1415
02:17:10,569 --> 02:17:14,250
Um, to unlock new costumes for them and art.

1416
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:15,209
Man, it's just kind of fun.

1417
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:35,959
Gives you points in the Wario Cup mode.

1418
02:17:35,959 --> 02:17:39,629
Oh, that's kind of cool.

1419
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:44,219
Change mic.

1420
02:17:44,219 --> 02:17:44,620
I'm going to...

1421
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:45,100
Don't worry.

1422
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:46,620
I'll give everybody their final costumes.

1423
02:17:50,059 --> 02:17:56,170
I'm just going to get rid of these.

1424
02:17:56,170 --> 02:18:16,959
Oh, that's too bad.

1425
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:17,760
All right.

1426
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:18,079
Let's see.

1427
02:18:18,079 --> 02:18:19,600
So we got Wario.

1428
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:23,739
Look at Wario's gallery.

1429
02:18:23,739 --> 02:18:24,059
Cool.

1430
02:18:24,620 --> 02:18:27,639
Really creepy and weird.

1431
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:30,030
Very cool.

1432
02:18:30,829 --> 02:18:32,379
Very cool.

1433
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:37,450
Oh, look at all this.

1434
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:38,729
They got all the different colors.

1435
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:41,659
Phantom blue thanks to the five community subs.

1436
02:18:42,219 --> 02:18:43,260
Appreciate the community subs.

1437
02:18:43,979 --> 02:18:55,899
Kind of like, uh, shadowy Wario.

1438
02:18:55,899 --> 02:18:59,850
All right.

1439
02:18:59,850 --> 02:19:00,170
Cricket.

1440
02:19:00,889 --> 02:19:07,610
Cool.

1441
02:19:07,610 --> 02:19:07,930
Cool.

1442
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:10,940
Cool.

1443
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:12,670
Cool.

1444
02:19:13,309 --> 02:19:17,549
Okay, now should I...

1445
02:19:17,549 --> 02:19:17,870
What do you...

1446
02:19:17,870 --> 02:19:19,950
Should I get you special or what?

1447
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:22,079
I kind of like that.

1448
02:19:22,719 --> 02:19:30,170
No, no special.

1449
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:30,409
All right.

1450
02:19:30,409 --> 02:19:31,129
Let's do main.

1451
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:33,420
Color hair.

1452
02:19:33,979 --> 02:19:50,860
Green with a orange shirt and yellow pants.

1453
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:51,180
Sure.

1454
02:19:51,739 --> 02:19:55,479
All right.

1455
02:19:55,479 --> 02:19:56,200
Mona, what about you?

1456
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,350
Very cool.

1457
02:20:05,370 --> 02:20:06,010
Cool.

1458
02:20:06,010 --> 02:20:06,649
Cool.

1459
02:20:06,649 --> 02:20:07,370
Cool.

1460
02:20:07,370 --> 02:20:07,930
Cool.

1461
02:20:07,930 --> 02:20:08,329
Cool.

1462
02:20:09,209 --> 02:20:10,360
Come on, man.

1463
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:11,239
I'm just winding down.

1464
02:20:11,239 --> 02:20:12,840
I expelled all my...

1465
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:14,200
I expelled all my energy.

1466
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:17,319
I'm screaming at the super hard mode.

1467
02:20:19,309 --> 02:20:20,350
All my energy is gone.

1468
02:20:20,829 --> 02:20:22,829
I beat no more heroes two hours ago.

1469
02:20:23,719 --> 02:20:24,200
Cool.

1470
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:24,440
Cool.

1471
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:25,799
It is cool, but I'm just tired.

1472
02:20:25,799 --> 02:20:26,600
I'm relaxing.

1473
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:27,000
Relax.

1474
02:20:27,559 --> 02:20:31,020
I like how this went from a nuclear meltdown to this.

1475
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:31,819
There wasn't even...

1476
02:20:31,819 --> 02:20:33,659
That was not a nuclear meltdown.

1477
02:20:36,889 --> 02:20:37,530
It was not.

1478
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:40,200
A nuclear meltdown.

1479
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:41,959
That is not even close.

1480
02:20:43,979 --> 02:20:45,739
It was not even close to a nuclear meltdown.

1481
02:20:45,739 --> 02:20:46,299
Give me a break.

1482
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:50,110
We did not go full nuclear.

1483
02:20:50,110 --> 02:20:50,590
No, we did not.

1484
02:20:50,590 --> 02:20:51,229
Oh, I like that.

1485
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:04,079
Well, you're screaming at the game.

1486
02:21:04,079 --> 02:21:05,120
I wasn't screaming at the game.

1487
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,739
When did I scream at the game?

1488
02:21:10,459 --> 02:21:16,360
Streamer dies playing WarioWare on a 10-day sub-a-thon challenge.

1489
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:19,600
I need to listen to this.

1490
02:21:20,159 --> 02:21:37,690
Let's watch this.

1491
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:54,299
Okay.

1492
02:22:11,819 --> 02:22:13,180
Get over there, you fucking...

1493
02:22:29,559 --> 02:22:36,559
How long is this clip?

1494
02:22:38,959 --> 02:22:39,520
It dies.

1495
02:22:40,799 --> 02:22:43,120
10-day sub-a-thon challenge.

1496
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:51,000
Why couldn't I fucking break it?

1497
02:22:51,959 --> 02:22:57,610
Get over there, you fucking...

1498
02:22:59,979 --> 02:23:01,500
There is like a delay.

1499
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:02,540
It's like a tenth of a second.

1500
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:03,579
Get over there, you fucking...

1501
02:23:04,379 --> 02:23:06,510
It's because of the webcam lag.

1502
02:23:06,510 --> 02:23:06,909
Okay.

1503
02:23:06,909 --> 02:23:07,549
Well, whatever.

1504
02:23:07,549 --> 02:23:08,989
You got any more clips I can watch?

1505
02:23:08,989 --> 02:23:09,309
Sure.

1506
02:23:11,659 --> 02:23:12,459
Watch this one.

1507
02:23:12,459 --> 02:23:12,780
Okay.

1508
02:23:19,049 --> 02:23:20,729
I don't think this was a nuclear meltdown.

1509
02:23:20,729 --> 02:23:21,450
I really don't think so.

1510
02:23:22,090 --> 02:23:23,290
I think you guys got it wrong.

1511
02:23:32,329 --> 02:23:33,850
I don't consider this to be nuclear.

1512
02:23:34,489 --> 02:23:36,569
This was like...

1513
02:23:36,569 --> 02:23:37,930
This was slight irritation.

1514
02:23:46,989 --> 02:23:50,379
That character...

1515
02:23:50,379 --> 02:23:51,180
What?

1516
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:51,819
That character...

1517
02:23:51,819 --> 02:23:52,700
That character is like...

1518
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:54,649
I was like...

1519
02:23:54,649 --> 02:23:58,170
Some of this is clearly having a small amount of issue

1520
02:23:58,170 --> 02:24:01,770
with the fact that the video game was fucking poorly.

1521
02:24:02,409 --> 02:24:04,649
I didn't expect what was going to happen in front of me.

1522
02:24:04,649 --> 02:24:06,889
That's a very normal reaction to have

1523
02:24:06,889 --> 02:24:09,610
when there's something incredibly that you don't think is going to happen happens.

1524
02:24:10,329 --> 02:24:11,370
Three-year-old.

1525
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:12,489
That's not a three-year-old.

1526
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:23,680
I got...

1527
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:26,319
I'm getting stuck because I was at level...

1528
02:24:26,319 --> 02:24:28,239
I was at literally episode 49,

1529
02:24:28,799 --> 02:24:29,760
trying to get to 50.

1530
02:24:30,719 --> 02:24:31,680
I couldn't do it.

1531
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:33,920
That's a horrible, horrible scenario.

1532
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:37,239
Here's another one.

1533
02:24:37,879 --> 02:24:38,280
All right.

1534
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:41,079
I'm going to only watch like two more of these before I get the point.

1535
02:24:41,079 --> 02:24:42,120
I don't think it was nuclear.

1536
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:42,840
I don't think it was.

1537
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:43,319
It was like...

1538
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:44,760
It was sizzling.

1539
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:45,399
It was simmering.

1540
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:49,100
It was simmering a little.

1541
02:24:49,899 --> 02:24:56,399
This shit was not nuclear.

1542
02:24:56,399 --> 02:24:56,559
All right.

1543
02:24:56,559 --> 02:24:57,120
What's this one?

1544
02:25:11,870 --> 02:25:13,469
That was fucking stupid.

1545
02:25:15,149 --> 02:25:15,790
Don't you get that?

1546
02:25:15,790 --> 02:25:16,750
What are you, motherfucker?

1547
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:17,870
What are you doing?

1548
02:25:17,870 --> 02:25:18,350
What?

1549
02:25:18,350 --> 02:25:18,670
What?

1550
02:25:18,670 --> 02:25:19,389
What the hell?

1551
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:21,440
Okay.

1552
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:22,000
Okay.

1553
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,040
What the fuck?

1554
02:25:25,629 --> 02:25:30,170
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1555
02:25:30,170 --> 02:25:31,370
But watch what happens here.

1556
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:34,649
She doesn't grab it.

1557
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:36,489
She didn't grab it.

1558
02:25:36,489 --> 02:25:37,370
And she's supposed to be...

1559
02:25:37,370 --> 02:25:39,370
When you touch it, you put it goes on your character.

1560
02:25:39,370 --> 02:25:44,139
What the fuck are you, motherfucker?

1561
02:25:44,139 --> 02:25:45,260
What are you doing?

1562
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:45,659
What?

1563
02:25:45,659 --> 02:25:46,059
What?

1564
02:25:46,059 --> 02:25:46,780
What the hell?

1565
02:25:48,239 --> 02:25:48,799
Okay.

1566
02:25:48,799 --> 02:25:49,360
Okay.

1567
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:53,049
What the fuck?

1568
02:25:53,049 --> 02:25:54,809
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1569
02:25:55,530 --> 02:25:59,659
The air blow.

1570
02:25:59,659 --> 02:26:00,059
All right.

1571
02:26:00,059 --> 02:26:00,780
Last one.

1572
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:01,579
I'm not watching.

1573
02:26:01,579 --> 02:26:01,979
You'll see.

1574
02:26:01,979 --> 02:26:03,020
Watch the second channel.

1575
02:26:04,299 --> 02:26:05,659
You'll see this video soon.

1576
02:26:11,319 --> 02:26:12,840
Oh, fucking nuclear.

1577
02:26:14,989 --> 02:26:21,040
I don't know what this one is, but I'm gonna watch it.

1578
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:23,600
This one's called the air blow psycho.

1579
02:26:43,739 --> 02:26:45,020
That one's kinda fucked up.

1580
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:48,760
It's kinda fucked up.

1581
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:49,000
Okay.

1582
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,899
That one was like a fireball was just going towards me.

1583
02:26:53,899 --> 02:27:00,670
And that's the last thing I thought to do before I got liquefied.

1584
02:27:00,670 --> 02:27:01,629
Oh my goodness.

1585
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:06,879
Holy shit, dude.

1586
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:16,540
I'm at Thanksgiving dinner.

1587
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:23,040
And we're sitting there as the family.

1588
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:26,239
And the sun's not there or something.

1589
02:27:26,239 --> 02:27:30,000
It's like, oh, everyone's at the table except for like Sean.

1590
02:27:30,559 --> 02:27:33,280
And I'm mom.

1591
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,319
And I spent all day doing this.

1592
02:27:35,319 --> 02:27:38,299
Setting up this table and everything.

1593
02:27:38,299 --> 02:27:40,540
And then finally, like we're in the middle of a conversation.

1594
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:44,620
And like Sean comes down and fucking just in his underwear.

1595
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:47,930
He goes into the fridge and starts drinking milk out of the carton.

1596
02:27:47,930 --> 02:27:51,559
And I just took a bite at a turkey.

1597
02:27:51,559 --> 02:27:54,840
That's the face that's like the holy shit, Sean.

1598
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:56,840
What the fuck are you doing?

1599
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:58,909
Why are you not down here?

1600
02:27:58,909 --> 02:28:00,030
Surrounded by family.

1601
02:28:00,030 --> 02:28:02,430
Uncles, aunts, cousins, relatives.

1602
02:28:05,870 --> 02:28:07,709
And now it's embarrassing for me now because I have to talk.

1603
02:28:07,709 --> 02:28:18,440
What am I going to do about this?

1604
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:19,479
All right, I'm out of here.

1605
02:28:19,479 --> 02:28:20,120
I'm done.

1606
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:21,799
Wait, let's look at the rest of these.

1607
02:28:21,799 --> 02:28:25,020
That wasn't even nuclear.

1608
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:28,680
It was a little spicy, I will tell you.

1609
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:35,159
Hold on.

1610
02:28:35,159 --> 02:28:35,639
Wait, wait, wait.

1611
02:28:35,639 --> 02:28:36,280
This is one more.

1612
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:37,319
Fighting cat dog.

1613
02:28:40,969 --> 02:28:42,170
Fighting cat dog?

1614
02:28:42,170 --> 02:28:43,530
Like Nickelodeon cat dog?

1615
02:28:44,329 --> 02:28:49,899
I don't get it.

1616
02:28:49,899 --> 02:28:51,819
Did I make a Nickelodeon reference?

1617
02:28:51,819 --> 02:28:55,120
What's the Nickelodeon reference?

1618
02:29:00,909 --> 02:29:03,229
That one needs to be patched.

1619
02:29:03,229 --> 02:29:05,389
That one needs to be patched.

1620
02:29:05,469 --> 02:29:07,309
That one needs to be patched.

1621
02:29:07,309 --> 02:29:09,069
That one needs to be patched.

1622
02:29:10,110 --> 02:29:12,670
That one needs to be patched.

1623
02:29:12,670 --> 02:29:14,909
Are you talking about the rabbit from cat dog?

1624
02:29:15,950 --> 02:29:16,670
Cat dog?

1625
02:29:17,389 --> 02:29:19,149
You guys are in lots of trouble.

1626
02:29:19,149 --> 02:29:22,590
You think that you can come into my restaurant, cat dog?

1627
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:23,549
Oh, fuck it is.

1628
02:29:23,549 --> 02:29:24,190
It's the rabbit.

1629
02:29:24,190 --> 02:29:25,069
It's like the bad guy.

1630
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:31,079
That one needs to be patched.

1631
02:29:31,079 --> 02:29:33,319
That one needs to be patched.

1632
02:29:33,319 --> 02:29:35,159
That one needs to be patched.

1633
02:29:35,159 --> 02:29:36,920
That one needs to be patched.

1634
02:29:37,959 --> 02:29:39,399
That one needs to be...

1635
02:29:42,459 --> 02:29:43,899
It's the cat dog rabbit.

1636
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:51,799
How would you even...

1637
02:29:51,799 --> 02:29:52,600
Oh my god.

1638
02:29:57,079 --> 02:29:58,280
We consider and watch these.

1639
02:29:59,639 --> 02:30:00,840
Maybe it was a little nuclear.

1640
02:30:01,559 --> 02:30:02,360
I don't think nuclear...

1641
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:02,600
Look.

1642
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:04,809
All right.

1643
02:30:04,809 --> 02:30:05,209
Well, look.

1644
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:12,350
I think I've gone all year without a nuclear stream.

1645
02:30:12,350 --> 02:30:12,989
So whatever.

1646
02:30:12,989 --> 02:30:13,629
I don't even care.

1647
02:30:15,389 --> 02:30:16,030
I don't even care.

1648
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:17,790
I don't even care.

1649
02:30:18,670 --> 02:30:19,870
I don't even care, you know?

1650
02:30:19,870 --> 02:30:20,350
I don't care.

1651
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:22,909
All right.

1652
02:30:22,909 --> 02:30:23,309
Last one.

1653
02:30:23,309 --> 02:30:23,549
What is this?

1654
02:30:23,549 --> 02:30:24,909
I'm stuck on shit.

1655
02:30:24,909 --> 02:30:27,149
Great 2D character game in a Wario game.

1656
02:30:27,149 --> 02:30:38,569
It's fucking caught.

1657
02:30:39,930 --> 02:30:41,930
Some of these are just impossible.

1658
02:30:41,930 --> 02:30:43,129
And I guess you have to live with that.

1659
02:30:44,170 --> 02:30:45,280
What's wrong with that?

1660
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:46,159
I'm stuck on shit.

1661
02:30:46,159 --> 02:30:51,799
Great 2D character game in a Wario game.

1662
02:30:51,799 --> 02:30:52,520
It's not...

1663
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:52,840
All right.

1664
02:30:58,909 --> 02:31:00,350
I've won Batman.

1665
02:31:00,350 --> 02:31:00,670
All right.

1666
02:31:00,670 --> 02:31:02,270
This is actually the last one.

1667
02:31:02,270 --> 02:31:02,590
I'm...

1668
02:31:02,590 --> 02:31:02,829
Look.

1669
02:31:02,829 --> 02:31:02,989
Yeah.

1670
02:31:02,989 --> 02:31:03,790
I was pissed off.

1671
02:31:04,909 --> 02:31:07,149
I'm playing super hard nuclear mode.

1672
02:31:07,149 --> 02:31:07,629
All right.

1673
02:31:07,629 --> 02:31:11,549
If I'm going to play nuclear mode and try to get past 50 rounds on nuclear,

1674
02:31:11,549 --> 02:31:12,989
it's going to be a nuclear stream.

1675
02:31:12,989 --> 02:31:14,030
Don't you get it?

1676
02:31:14,030 --> 02:31:20,959
This is the last one.

1677
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:24,399
And then we're going to go through the last of the artwork here.

1678
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:28,120
And we're going to go from there.

1679
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:32,590
What was this called?

1680
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:33,709
You've won Batman?

1681
02:31:33,709 --> 02:31:34,829
Or I've won Batman?

1682
02:31:34,829 --> 02:31:35,469
I don't know.

1683
02:31:35,469 --> 02:31:36,110
One of those two.

1684
02:31:39,879 --> 02:31:53,469
Just a laugh.

1685
02:31:53,469 --> 02:31:55,790
Where's the one where I call it a flop?

1686
02:31:55,790 --> 02:31:56,590
I'm going to see that one.

1687
02:31:57,469 --> 02:31:57,950
All right.

1688
02:31:57,950 --> 02:31:59,950
Somebody link me the one where I call the game a flop.

1689
02:31:59,950 --> 02:32:01,069
That's the one I really want to see.

1690
02:32:10,879 --> 02:32:11,760
Jerry Seinfeld.

1691
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:12,479
It's not that one.

1692
02:32:14,750 --> 02:32:15,549
He hates it.

1693
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:17,639
That's probably it.

1694
02:32:23,959 --> 02:32:27,559
I am going to judge if this is a nuclear stream or not by this...

1695
02:32:27,559 --> 02:32:29,159
My interaction here.

1696
02:32:29,799 --> 02:32:35,200
Because I can tell that I was actually a little actually irritated during this part.

1697
02:32:37,149 --> 02:32:37,950
It's not that one.

1698
02:32:38,670 --> 02:32:43,120
Okay.

1699
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:43,680
Let's find out.

1700
02:32:44,319 --> 02:32:53,420
You like this game?

1701
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:53,579
No.

1702
02:32:54,219 --> 02:32:55,260
No, I hate it, actually.

1703
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:56,139
I think this is the worst one.

1704
02:32:57,760 --> 02:32:59,840
This is the worst game I've played in the last 10 years.

1705
02:33:00,399 --> 02:33:00,799
At least.

1706
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:03,579
What a...

1707
02:33:03,579 --> 02:33:04,139
What a...

1708
02:33:04,139 --> 02:33:05,340
What a fucking flop.

1709
02:33:06,059 --> 02:33:07,420
All right.

1710
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:09,020
I concede it was nuclear.

1711
02:33:09,020 --> 02:33:10,959
I concede.

1712
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:12,639
I concede.

1713
02:33:12,639 --> 02:33:13,680
Let's get back to this.

1714
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:14,639
Okay.

1715
02:33:14,639 --> 02:33:16,059
Oh!

1716
02:33:16,059 --> 02:33:16,700
Look at this artwork.

1717
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:17,100
Dr...

1718
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:17,819
Dr.

1719
02:33:17,819 --> 02:33:18,379
Chrygor.

1720
02:33:18,379 --> 02:33:19,180
Now, hold on.

1721
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:19,959
You can't hear anything.

1722
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:20,440
There we go.

1723
02:33:21,079 --> 02:33:21,719
All right.

1724
02:33:21,719 --> 02:33:22,520
We have...

1725
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:27,079
Who do we have to-

1726
02:33:27,079 --> 02:33:27,399
He's coming to us.

1727
02:33:27,399 --> 02:33:29,559
We have a new wave of people who didn't kill themselvesake.

1728
02:33:29,559 --> 02:33:32,559
He just succeeded at his정을.

1729
02:33:32,559 --> 02:33:33,280
Why?

1730
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:35,870

1780
02:43:55,250 --> 02:44:09,049
community subs community subs this really was a meltdown stream well no it wasn't actually here's

1781
02:44:09,049 --> 02:44:15,270
my defense the first four hours of this stream was me just playing no more heroes than us hanging

1782
02:44:15,270 --> 02:44:21,959
out so it doesn't really qualify as a meltdown stream only the last hour or two was a true

1783
02:44:21,959 --> 02:44:30,479
meltdown anyways I'll see you guys next weekend take care of yourselves thanks for watching as

1784

always good night goodbye and take care
