1
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:48,780
What's, uh, what's happening? How you doing? Yeah, supposed to be live tomorrow, but good life today. Felt like it. Hope you're doing well.

2
00:00:50,740 --> 00:01:08,700
Got a plan tonight. Uh, I was going to play Dark and Darker Tomorrow, but I saw everybody playing it and I got, I got FOMO and I didn't, I was like, okay, it's out right now. It's only going to be up for like five or six days or something.

3
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,579
I was like, I don't want to waste it tomorrow. I want to play it right now. I did play a handful of rounds just to get the controls because there's not really a proper tutorial. I understand how the game works. And boy, oh boy, is this game easy. My goodness. I've won every match. I have a ton of cool stuff. It's actually very simple. It's probably the easiest game I've ever played in regards to difficulty. And by that, I mean, um, it's hard for me to get

4
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:32,439
past the first two skeletons. And if I do that, I usually die in the next room. So yeah, I think it'll be fun. But I was, I was, I was like, what the fuck is going on? What is this game? What is this game? And then I decided to read the developer, um, little manual that's here. And in that manual, it says that, uh, 90% of our internal testers died to the first monster.

5
00:02:33,280 --> 00:03:21,460
Now I don't feel so bad. I don't feel so bad now, but that's just the way it is. Yeah. How come you're so zesty? Why is the microphone so close to my face? Hold on. There we go. Uh, yeah. And I know this game is about, I, I join a party. Don't do it alone, but whatever. Maybe we will. Maybe eventually. I don't know. I let me just see if I like it first, right? Let me just see if I like before I like hit up a bunch of streamer friends or YouTubers, whatever, or the people in the community or whatever. What I, let me just make, let me just make sure I like it.

6
00:03:21,620 --> 00:04:15,469
Surprise stream. Yes. That was easy. Where's Gunnu? Hey, Gunnu. No, no, no, no, no. People haven't, people didn't potentially watch the VOD last night. I don't want to give any spoilers. All right. So let's go. I'm just going to go. I do have a question. And I know a lot of you, this is my first time playing this. I didn't participate in the alpha first two alphas, whatever they were. So I'm going to have a lot of questions and I would like them to have them answered. If you could please help me.

7
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:55,160
Question number one, this new map, this goblin caves map, put it in the emote only. What? No, I don't do that. I need help. Is this goblin caves map something I should be doing solo? Because when I went to it and I opened it, it looked like a ton of really hard monsters were just walking around. Yeah. Because as of this update, I think it's there's a solo only map. It's only solo. The goblin cave is so hard.

8
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:35,250
Yeah. It's really hard monsters. Yeah. It's solo, but way hard. Okay. All right. Well, let's just, I'm just jumping in. Look, and I, you look, people are going to give me a lot of help. I'm sure there's going to be people that are trickling into this stream that like are going to ask, hey, I'm just like curious. Can, can this guy tie his shoes or is this like a normal thing? And I know I'm, I'm ready to, I'm prepared to look over and see so bad omega low. And I'm going to make sure it doesn't get to me. I'm going to look over. I'm going to see it probably every 10 seconds.

9
00:05:35,250 --> 00:06:19,009
I've just, I know it. I, I'm in the mirror. I was, I was doing nice, relaxed breathing. I was going, all right, you can do this. We're going to be good. It's already bad. All right. Are you guys ready? I've got my drink here. I'm ready to play some games. Let's go for it. You'll be doing well. Don't make fun of me too much. I'm new. So, uh, I'm just going to do the regular mode. I made a couple of characters. This is mead one, not to be confused with mead.

10
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:51,620
Three, mead four, mead five, or smush. I have smush one, smush three, smush seven. Well, sorry, smush now. Where's mead two? Yeah, I skipped over two and I skipped over like five. I don't know who to play with.

11
00:06:51,620 --> 00:07:11,149
Barbarian seems dangerous. Fighter seems like the thing to start with. I'm going to start with fighter. I'm going to start with, I got a shield. Is this a good stream to fall asleep to? Um,

12
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:23,319
ask that again in 20 minutes after I've screamed for the first time. Probably, hopefully not that loud. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to stay with the fighter. This is just the default class. It's just the fighter.

13
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:37,339
You can use most gear. You can do most things and you have a sword and a shield. I'm just going to go. I don't know why. I must have said hi at some point with the other character to nobody. All right, let's go. Let's go. I'm going.

14
00:07:37,339 --> 00:08:08,189
Am I going to get stream sniped? Oh shit. I probably am. I'm going to get, I'm going to get stream sniped. Oh, it's open mic. I turned it off. I made sure to turn voice chat off. Don't worry. I put, I put stream remote on and I turned off voice chat. I don't know if that matters.

15
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:56,750
Okay. Here we go. Both headphones going in. It's time for me to try this game out. All right. It's time for me to try this game out. That was kind of E3, I will say. Okay. I already hear something. Hold on. Should I worry about people hearing my footprints?

16
00:08:56,750 --> 00:10:07,179
Pick it up. What is that? Is it loud? It sounds kind of loud. Oh, a gem. Does that mean anything? Is it good? Okay, good. There's a lot. Okay. So for those of you that don't know, this is a PV, PVP, PVPVPE. Okay. I can't make any, I can't like talk. Is that a person? This is, that's a player. Is it a player?

17
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:35,110
What the, what is that? Ow. All right. So I'm dead. All right. So I died. That's, it's a good test run. I'm dead and I lost. It is kind of loud. It's too loud. All right. That's it. That's game number one. I'm trying to think of what I might have done wrong there.

18
00:10:35,110 --> 00:11:46,100
I got, I got, there's too many people in that room and I met, I messed up. Is this a VR game? All right. Is the audio, how's the, how is the audio? Is it actually too soft? Like that? I wonder if that's better. Music can stay there. All right. So the whole, what can you, can I, can, what did I do wrong? What did I do? I can't do face cam. I don't have any clothes on. I literally don't have a shirt on. I can't. I'm not doing that. So should I just wait and slowly walk around and open chests and stuff?

19
00:11:47,100 --> 00:12:59,700
Only engage one enemy at a time. I mean like this mother fucker right here. All right. Well, there's two enemies now. What? I didn't block it. Excuse me. Why is that not blocking? Hold on. That one doesn't count. Why did it not block? You went right through the fucking shield. It's loud. It's a timed block. Wait, it's timed. So I can't just hold it up. I have to like, oh, boom.

20
00:12:59,700 --> 00:14:02,860
Okay. I'm learning. Hey, the developers of the game couldn't even get past the first run. So easy. Easy. I'm not going to uninstall the game. What are you talking about? I'm not going to uninstall it. Yeah. Well, I guess I'm going to uninstall the game. That's enough. I've had enough. Oh my God. That probably hurt. That was my blood coming off of my hand. That was nothing to do with his head. Aim at the, at the attack. I'll figure it out. Okay.

21
00:14:02,860 --> 00:15:33,320
No, I'm not uninstalling it. The only way you can get good is if you get good. Nowhere in the get good manual is it uninstall the game after 10 minutes. That's not get good. I thought that hurt me. Ooh, a ring. I'm not going that way. I'll deal. I'll deal with the spiders. One hit. Okay. Look over here. Can I break that? Okay. You can break it. All right. All right. All right. Not bad.

22
00:15:33,320 --> 00:16:49,240
Okay. Not bad. Not bad. Didn't take any damage. I got to move here. Actually, I don't want to go this way. The thing's coming. Look at the mini map. Should I cover the mini map? Is that what streamers do? Cause you know where I am. What is this? Why are you in this room? So is somebody saying it's a physics based block? All right. Give me a fucking diamond. Give me some gems, some jewels. Thank you. All right. How do I get out of here? I want to leave now. I got three gems.

23
00:16:49,240 --> 00:18:21,930
I'm done. I want to leave. How do I get out? How do I get out of here? I need to find a portal. Where are they? Is there weight in this game? Okay. I got to go over here. I got to wrap around. I can't get this way. Head towards the middle. They only spawn near the end of the round. Okay. And the round is eight and a half minutes left from what I understand. You're looking at that, right? Watch out. I got to go. I got to go. I got to go.

24
00:18:21,930 --> 00:19:32,869
How do I get through this? Can I open this? I got to go now. Is there a lever? I don't, I don't see one. I don't see one. Is there one on the wall? I don't see. I'm just going to go this way. Oh shit. I'm dead. Or the side of the door. Uh, hold on. I got kind of screwed here. I got screwed. What the fuck is wrong with me? What happened? What? Where the fuck did all these people come from? I got screwed. I got screwed. That's what happened.

25
00:19:32,869 --> 00:20:41,990
I couldn't leave. And the thing, I got screwed. Is this harder than Elden Ring? Um, I don't know. Maybe it was a stone by one of the doors. I'm getting it though. I'm understanding it. Yeah. The game is meant to be very difficult by design. Well, I kind of, that was kind of a bad spawn. I got trapped behind that wall with the lever and I didn't, it was on the other side. Best to play it in a team. Well, I would like to get to a point where I see another player first. All right, let's go. I get it. This looks like a much better spawn.

26
00:20:41,990 --> 00:22:44,920
Am I poisoned? I'm already poisoned. Shit. Come on, man. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. Two movement speed. Those are pretty good. I actually am a little faster. All right. All right. All right. Campfire kit. I know this heals. Somebody shooting. Make sure to close the doors behind you. Yeah, that's true. Shit. What have you done? Why'd you aggro everybody? Oh, what have you done? What have I done? What have you done? I got him. How do I heal? Fuck you. Oh,

27
00:22:44,920 --> 00:23:50,410
oh, Jesus. You can't get in here. I'm going to heal in here. All right. I feel pretty good about that. All right. So can, can rogues go invisible? What happened? Oh, I'm okay. Oh, it's only like a half heal. All right. I got to kill. I'm happy about that. I got to go loot that body. Your E is a heal. It is. Oh my God. I thought it was like a power up. Where'd that, where'd that guy die?

28
00:23:50,410 --> 00:26:03,079
Oh my. Oh shit. What is this? An, a sacrificial altar. Oh, okay. I'm fucking, I'm fucking out of here. Like the whole instance aggroed to me. Okay. What was that? How do I throw this? Oh shit. A portal appeared. Did they show up on the mini map or no? The hell? How do I put, how do I equip that? All right. I'm kind of safe here. It's like three.

29
00:26:03,079 --> 00:27:50,890
My friends, those, they're friends. I ain't going over there. Oh shit. It's three of them. It's three people. It's three people. I killed somebody. Shit. Holy shit. There's an omega chest. Guys. There's an omega chest right here. Oh, I can't, how do I get out of here? I hope I, I need to leave now. I'm safe right here. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. This is so much. I can take everything. Oh my God. Look at all this gear. That's all. This doesn't look good. Does anybody have anything? What a battle that came. Look at this battle that happened here.

30
00:27:50,890 --> 00:28:22,829
This stuff, it's all just default shit. This guy's going over. Oh, that's like a whole party. That's a whole party. That's an entire party.

31
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:43,960
I got nowhere to run. How'd I get out of here? Use your invisibility potion? How do I switch to it? How do I switch to it?

32
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,799
How do I switch to it? How do I switch to it? How do I switch, how do I switch to it?

33
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,839
How do I switch to it? How do I, what button? Tell me. Quick. Quick. Quickly. Quick. Four. Quickly.

34
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:56,680

35
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:16,940
Shit that hurt who from where from behind? What are you talking about? Oh?

36
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:32,039

103
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,369

106
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:23,619
That's the first time I've ever seen one. I in my brain

107
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:28,920
I don't know why I figured it was like press E and it just you just go in I didn't know it was like

108
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:45,780
For like 15 seconds. God damn it. That wizard was in the same position. Did the wizard get out?

109
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:52,360
Did I I let that wizard get out? That's what happened. Oh man

110
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,539
I took all the aggro away from the wizard or the wizard. Oh, he died. Okay. I don't feel as bad anymore

111
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,829
That was so close, too

112
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:05,150
I didn't know I thought you could just like go into it

113
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:13,679
I didn't know you had to sit there and open it like a treasure chest wizard was helping you

114
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:23,079
It's one portal per person. There are one time use. Oh

115
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,039

116
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:43,840
You want to be first to the center? That's one of the reasons why god damn it. Oh

00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,250
All my stuff that I got

118
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:56,730
Alright, I'm getting I'm going to the center right now. I'm just trying to get there immediately after I touch this

119
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:14,110
Never mind. Oh my god. Stop

122
00:51:47,789 --> 00:52:00,780
It's good. Okay. No, I need to get to the center. Even if I leave here with one health potion, I don't care

123
00:52:49,619 --> 00:53:58,110
I'm trying to I can't right-click always take out the healer first. That's what you taught me. Mm-hmm. Something's wrong. Something's wrong

124
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:24,449
God damn it 2v1 fuck your swords too short. All right

125
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:34,719
So I have two things to ask that was that a healer or am I just wrong chain your attacks together?

126
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:40,809
I mean, well, there's somebody behind you and somebody in front of you. I'm just getting fucking beat up

127
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:47,340
That was a cleric. So the cleric that green

128
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:59,530
Beam was a heal. How good is it? It's good. Okay

129
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:05,750
I was I didn't you know, I was thinking like this game is kind of a hard game and like oh, I'm a healer

130
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:14,269
I feel like it would be like a shitty heal, but it's good. It's really good. Okay, 35 on others 15 on self

131
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:32,710
It's pretty good. Okay, so sprint and second wind adrenaline. Ooh

132
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:41,599
Well, yeah, why is everybody saying I wasn't but I was being I was like BMing

133
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:49,119
Cuz I've started attacking them. Uh, all I'm saying is I walked in that room

134
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,789
I walked in that room and

135
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:56,309
That I don't I don't know what the moves are that caster looked at me

136
00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:00,780
And then I saw like I saw him cast in a spell and I'm just like, okay

137
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,440
This is an aggressive spell. It was green. I thought it was a poison spell

138
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:10,059
I thought he was casting his poison spell at me. Some people are friendly. So I was just like the

139
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:12,420
crazy guy

140
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:20,750
Okay

141
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:28,440
There was even an opportunity for me to leave and I just like chugged a bunch of heels ran back in swinging

142
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:46,079
Okay. Yeah, but I don't know in a game like this. You don't expect anybody to be friendly. There's a taunt. That's kind of good

143
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:57,530
I feel like I need to use these more often. I'll be fine though. Yeah, PvP is the point of the game. Yeah. Yeah

144
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:08,530
Yeah, yeah, that's true. It's like oh this guy is attacking us. We're just trying to loot. Oh, all right. He left

145
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,880
What's that? I hear he's he's just he's okay

146
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,880
I hear him doing a bunch of drugs in the other room and then he screamed her aloud and came outside

147
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:38,659
Okay, cool you need to spam crouch to say you're friendly there's yeah, there's this VoIP. Yeah, I don't I don't want to use it

148
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:48,300

160
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:13,440

What another shit start I even saw you do I saw you I knew exactly what was going on over here

163
01:03:55,230 --> 01:04:11,679
You're not making this any easier

164
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:32,639
The sword is made out of styrofoam all it is just bad for the environment and I didn't do anything else

165
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:46,000
Oh my god, this is fucking awful. Like can I is the whole are we all right now?

171
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:50,460
it's fucking hot and you got to relax because you just have to be aware of your surroundings and

172
01:06:54,349 --> 01:07:00,179
Feel like an orc and orcs must die. It's just kind of whatever it's all right

173
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:04,260
It's uh, oh and I was doing pretty good there. No, that was not good

175
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:46,360
My hand stream snipers don't even have a chance. No, they kind of don't I'm probably pissing off the stream snipers right now

176
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,960
because they're spending all this time desperately trying to get over to where I am and

177
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:56,860
They they're spending like 15 to 20 minutes sometimes getting precisely to where I am and I just die in the first five minutes

178
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:08,130
And they're just like what the fuck maybe that's a deterrent to stream snipers interesting. All right, this is this is a this is a good room

179
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:26,979
Just watch out for that in the middle. Oh, come on

180
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:52,869

candy oil lantern

183
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:23,619

01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:22,289
He didn't do two in a row that last time and he did two in a row the next time

191
01:11:22,289 --> 01:11:28,930
I couldn't to dunk it. This is the one. This is the one. This is probably not the one

192
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:38,140
You have to go into it saying it's not the one. This is no way the game's impossible. It's not the one

193
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:40,199
This game is literally not completable

194
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:43,920
Okay, so that's how we're gonna go into this one. Look at look at look at this

266
01:38:16,470 --> 01:39:34,369
I hear somebody screaming. I gotta go back up open the chest. No. Oh my god. There's a lot of people in here

01:41:24,979 --> 01:41:37,550
Everybody follow me out here. There's a bunch of fucking adventures get out of the fucking way

273
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:49,659
Where is a portal? How is there not a portal here? Do you look there? Oh, well, there's no else to go. Oh

274
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:17,369
Fuck you run run run. I got nowhere to run. Where is a give me that fucking thing on your back. I'm dead

275
01:42:17,369 --> 01:42:21,090
I'm dead. I'm dead. Where are they? Yeah, this sucks

276
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:28,000
Where I did look at this. I'm literally running around in circles. Oh

277
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:43,560
My god, you mean to tell me that there's only there was one portal up here somewhere. Oh, that's such a pain in the ass

278
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:52,729
We're running around this little fucking circle and what one of the two dickheads is gonna find it

279
01:42:53,149 --> 01:43:09,600
This yeah, there was a big ramp. Yeah, I'm being followed by this whatever that guy is

280
01:43:10,119 --> 01:43:17,750
He could he completely fucked me over when he closed that door

281
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:38,819
Oh, that's so fucking sad. I had so much good shit too. He stopped you from going the wrong way

282
01:43:39,260 --> 01:44:10,619
Well, yeah at 2020 hindsight. We all know the portal is up here. Was it two portals up here? Well, I lost everything

283
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:35,729
I still believe another one spawns in the end. Is that right? Well, we go we go for it again

284
01:44:36,289 --> 01:45:00,800
Sad I was right there too. It's just like where fuck I had such a good weapon

285
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:29,640
Portal bullshit. All right now I'm pissed off. I'm go. I'm just going in I'm killing I don't know friendly

286
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:35,210
I'm not gonna crouch with a sandwich in my hand. Everybody's dead everyone. I'm going in

287
01:46:07,829 --> 01:46:53,159
All right, you are you have a whole combo. I'm dead. I can't move. I can't fucking move

288
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:09,260
Don't fight these why not? I thought that was a naked player. I thought that was a nude player

289
01:47:09,479 --> 01:47:46,930
That's a boss. Oh should have just crouched with a sandwich. Yeah, I was gonna say where the hell am I?

290
01:47:46,970 --> 01:48:07,520
There's so many people in this in this solo area

291
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:15,529
Am I am I crazy or is there like three times as many enemies in solo than the team stuff?

292
01:48:15,529 --> 01:48:57,199
I'm sorry. This guy has the whole dungeon on him. I know what it's like man. Trust me. I know it's

293
01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:12,869
I'm getting out of here. See you later. I want nothing to do with this. I help him. He's got seven

294
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:15,859
He's got seven ghouls on him. I

295
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:21,989
I'm not gonna help. Oh my god. Everybody has the same problem

296
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:30,779
Okay, there's a potion here. Hold on help help. I hold on

297
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:36,619
Yet now I've got the aggro

298
01:49:45,699 --> 01:49:54,140
I'm gonna drink this. Hey, let's go. Let's team up on voice command. Oh

299
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:25,000
You had that did oh, no, no, no. No, it did not it's in front of me. What is in front of me?

300
01:50:25,279 --> 01:50:28,220
What the fuck is this?

301
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:53,000
Jesus are you talking Joe? What are you talking about?

302
01:50:53,619 --> 01:50:55,789
What?

303
01:50:55,789 --> 01:51:07,220
Do this one is way harder. All right, you know when this shit is fucking hard and

304
01:51:07,819 --> 01:51:14,060
Just a little much when each person I saw I saw two different people had a an

305
01:51:14,739 --> 01:51:18,220
Absolute just there was a choo-choo train of enemies running after

306
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:37,840
Single person dude. This is laser tag on steroids. That's funny. I was fair and better in the team stuff

307
01:51:51,760 --> 01:52:30,220
Alright same spot. I need you to test it. That is hit myself with the sword. I'm hitting myself with my own weapon

308
01:52:34,800 --> 01:53:25,850
I'm already in trouble. There's a player. Alright, give me some stuff. Alright way back. I just got a green ring

309
01:53:25,850 --> 01:54:23,829
That's gonna be worth like 20 bucks. What was what is that? Oh, I might say that they can't fire eight eight

310
01:54:23,829 --> 01:54:57,880
Oh shit. Okay, I'm going in. What is that? I got okay. I'm gonna set it. I gotta move. No, I got a bandage

311
01:54:57,899 --> 01:55:09,810
No, no, no, no, I don't want to swing. Why is this what I'm not pressing any buttons?

312
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:14,630
I'm I might literally my hands are in the air guys. I'm not pressing any buttons. Stop swinging

313
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:20,409
I'm not pressing any buttons. I probably just looked like a fucking crazy person comes to the campfire

314
01:55:20,409 --> 01:55:34,670
Look, that's the dumbest thing in the game. There's literally should be removed

315
01:55:34,670 --> 01:56:40,829
They literally they should take it out of the game tomorrow. You take all this stuff. Ah, you missed this thing on the bottom

316
01:56:40,829 --> 01:57:43,399
Oh stop. That shit is way harder. I'd rather fight the three players. You can see traps on the map

317
01:57:43,579 --> 01:58:11,739
Really? I can't believe you're dying to level one goblin enemies. Yeah, pretty rough. All right. There we go

318
01:58:11,819 --> 01:59:06,100
Look at this already getting started with some fucking wines of olive oil. You holy shit. That's not bad

319
01:59:06,199 --> 01:59:09,310
Can't use it. But okay. I gotta go down. Oh

320
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:57,609
Okay, that's a good start take my time here

321
01:59:57,609 --> 02:00:40,970
I'm kind of in the middle so I don't really have to go that far that on nice. Oh, yep

322
02:00:40,989 --> 02:01:11,699
Those better 30 25 now, I'll hold them though. I get this whole area to myself spell book longbow

323
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:33,680
You go in the hole. Maybe ooh surge full heel. Oh my goodness. It's a full heel

324
02:01:33,720 --> 02:02:14,159
Okay, I got no excuse now. Where's the actual circle right now?

325
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:40,819
I feel like I'm very far away from it. There's a lot of shit in here. I'm gonna hang out it for a minute

326
02:02:40,819 --> 02:03:31,689
I think it's pretty quick too. It's a lot of money. Okay, let's go

327
02:03:31,689 --> 02:04:14,949
Loot so many chests. I gotta turn and run in a second here. Okay time to move

328
02:04:14,949 --> 02:04:19,960
I got a lot of money to one more chest and I'm gonna go I promise

329
02:04:19,960 --> 02:05:30,489
Yeah, I think sucks a lot of shit here. Look at all this stuff. No, I want to pick it up

330
02:05:30,489 --> 02:06:33,000
I want to pick it up. I want to leave leave. I am going I need a portal. It's up man

331
02:06:33,119 --> 02:07:17,899
What the fuck is that? What just happened? What was that something just exploded? Oh, I got okay. Oh my shit

332
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:41,590
I thought he was alone. All right. What what is what is that? What is this bullshit right here?

333
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:50,430
Why are there two here? What is this bullshit? How come there's two why wasn't what?

334
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:57,520
What's going on with the weather three portals in the same spot, dude?

335
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:16,250
I was running around like an asshole when I had all that shit and there was only one there in the middle

336
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:42,600
I was it directly in the center. What look at all these there's so many in this spot. Oh

337
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:47,630
Come on

338
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:57,380
You don't start spawning till late

339
02:08:57,380 --> 02:09:27,489
You should get near the center early then camp out till you see the prompts about a portal the caves I guess

340
02:09:31,579 --> 02:09:39,750
We actually might have a friend here. Hold on a second. I

341
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:57,899
Want it? I was gonna play with other I'm definitely into it. So I'm down to party in random places. It's all good

342
02:09:57,899 --> 02:10:08,949
I gotta make it I gotta make it out with something. Oh

343
02:10:26,439 --> 02:10:38,779
I thought a piece of glass like burnt me or whatever. You know, I mean at least sharp stab pain

344
02:10:38,840 --> 02:11:16,800
Oh, look at that. Don't go near that. Are they red fuck you

345
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:20,180
Come on

346
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:21,859

02:11:21,859 --> 02:11:52,359
Gotten a lot of gems and jewels. I picked solo, right? So what were they guarding? Can I open this? It's locked

348
02:11:52,619 --> 02:12:51,800
Hold on. Well, I have a second. Hold on typing my attack went right through him. Ooh

349
02:12:54,760 --> 02:13:23,659
What's resourcefulness? What does that do? He's sending he's sending emails to Gunu. My whole inventory is

350
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:31,050
Stuff that okay. I gotta get out. I'm getting out of here now. I have to escape. I just get so obsessed

351
02:13:31,289 --> 02:15:01,840
They're supposed to be dead. Dude guy you stink how many spiders are in this cave, please leave

352

354
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:42,529
We're all cool, right? Oh my god. This is how you play

355
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:47,729
You don't just like you just don't act like a rabid animal

356
02:15:50,409 --> 02:16:21,189
Wow, what's that? Oh, thank you. I thought he's gonna hit me. I am NOT going to kill it

357
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:26,020
No, I need I you know how many you know, I'm not gonna say this out loud. I don't have shit on me

358
02:16:26,020 --> 02:16:34,520
I have nothing on me. I don't have a bunch of jewels or anything. Did you crouch? Did you crouch yet?

359
02:16:34,520 --> 02:17:17,290
What's this? What the fuck is that? Oh my it's a red spider. No, that is not happening. Uh, uh-oh

360
02:17:19,139 --> 02:17:33,190
Is there a way to go? No. No, what do I do? I think I've just got I don't know

361
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:45,620
How do I how do I how do I fix this? How do I fix this? I have to run through it

362
02:17:45,620 --> 02:18:09,040
Bro, where are the freaking portals?

363
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:54,010
They gone why is there not one here?

364
02:18:54,010 --> 02:19:14,250
I thought it would spawn in a circle where I was they were on the floor above me, bro

365
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:33,479
With all that verticality, how can you tell where one ever is?

366
02:19:33,659 --> 02:19:48,180
They're all first-come first-serve. They always seem to spawn on the top floor

367
02:19:48,180 --> 02:20:16,459
Is that is that for real or is that just so they're always on the top floor? I made it up

368
02:20:16,459 --> 02:20:59,409
Oh, I'm just a day win motherfucker. Not that easy. There we go. All right, we're back in it now

369
02:20:59,409 --> 02:21:25,520
We're back in it. You just killed your friend

370
02:21:32,229 --> 02:22:03,540
You get hit once dude, you're fucking it's over god damn it. What the fuck I'm already dead

371
02:22:36,340 --> 02:23:23,340
Your health is low. Do you have any potions or food? I don't know what's up there, but I'm not going over there

372
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:42,729
Sorry, I read that from chat. I had to do it. What you there's no way you hit me with that

373
02:23:43,250 --> 02:24:09,860
Get out of town. I'm in so much trouble. No, no, no, I'm in so much trouble. There's a fucking plate right there

374
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:19,799
What's going on? Ah, what? Where are they?

375
02:24:27,979 --> 02:24:35,159
This is so hard, I got decapitated

376
02:24:37,139 --> 02:24:44,569
God damn it. I got a but I got I gotta buy something. I have to buy something. I'm buying

377
02:24:44,950 --> 02:25:02,870
I'm gonna lose all my money buying buying this longsword. No, I'm not 34. I'm buying this

378
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:16,809
I gotta give myself a chance, right?

379
02:25:17,209 --> 02:25:43,209
47 this one's 13 the believers are filing for bankruptcy

380
02:25:43,489 --> 02:26:20,680
At least I have some armor and more than 20 damage. We're good. Everything's good. Does he make it out alive?

381
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:36,430
2.1 to 9 point Wow. Well if I win I make a lot of you really really rich with channel points

382
02:26:36,430 --> 02:27:05,000
That's for sure. I was just a lever. This thing is huge. You just put two that that's what's in here

383
02:27:05,000 --> 02:28:11,799
I was stuck. It was so loud. Patch it. What is this? What did that do? Secret? Stop it. Stop!

384
02:28:13,149 --> 02:28:29,639
Throw a torch at it. Yes. Ooh

385
02:28:36,090 --> 02:28:46,350
A spear. I don't know how to use this. Is it 34 versus 39? I don't know

386
02:28:46,610 --> 02:29:03,969
It's where I got a lot of reach though. Okay. So the last one is a swing down

387
02:29:04,049 --> 02:29:20,239
Looks like it has a block at least or the parry at least. Okay, cool. All right, let's go. What do I?

388
02:29:20,879 --> 02:30:43,399
Why this is a maze but that was a player that's shit away from me. Oh

389
02:30:43,920 --> 02:32:19,219
Portal up. Holy shit you oh my god. How'd tell me how to tell how can you tell?

390
02:32:19,639 --> 02:32:21,819
Yeah, okay. Okay

391
02:32:22,139 --> 02:32:36,530
Okay, I'm not look. What do I do? What the fuck? There's no pressure plate

392
02:32:36,549 --> 02:32:42,340
They just they're just little blended into the walls. The map will show that's so teeny tiny

393
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:50,030
I ain't looking over there. What it wasn't on the map. I'm looking at the map right now. What am I standing on?

394
02:32:50,690 --> 02:32:59,049
Excuse me. What what is happening? Did you see the mini map? It was there was two behind me

395
02:32:59,049 --> 02:33:05,819
There was one what my my indicator was on top of it my little indicator

396
02:33:05,819 --> 02:33:12,040
It's so teeny little tiny my characters arrow indicator was covering it

397
02:33:12,239 --> 02:33:40,100
You can crouch crouch. I didn't know you could avoid it by crouching this

398
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:42,620
How was I supposed to know that?

399
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:49,690
It reminds me of

400
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:53,870
Darkest dungeon when some you just walk in and all of a sudden it's just like yeah

401
02:33:53,870 --> 02:34:22,209
Like the thing just fucking the trap on the ground just attacks you I'm fucking angry now

402
02:34:22,329 --> 02:34:29,510
You I know, you know, I was that me or you well, I thought that was that I thought there's a mage

403
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:32,569
I thought that was a player. This is not a player

404
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:38,489
Man I get

405
02:34:41,159 --> 02:35:14,819
What fuck get him kill him with this shit die

406
02:35:21,729 --> 02:35:40,959
That was such a shitty spawn. Oh, well swing at it. I'm good. That thing's like a super hard thing block it

407
02:35:40,959 --> 02:35:50,459
I think it goes through the block Otto. What it's Otto

408
02:35:51,040 --> 02:36:08,389
Dog needs Otto. It's Otto. That's cool. That's cool

409
02:36:09,409 --> 02:36:29,579
Remember that was a cat. Everybody loves Otto. You're dying too fast for mods to be able to put up new poles

410
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:34,659
Dude, I'm sorry. What am I supposed to do?

411
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:54,760
back back

412
02:36:54,760 --> 02:37:38,299
Good I get poisoned. Oh, come on. That's a big deal. That's one knowledge. I'm so much smarter with this on look

413
02:37:38,299 --> 02:38:17,200
Oh, I want to mine this so bad. That's where you get the crystals. They're more than one. It was two burning eggs

414
02:38:17,420 --> 02:39:16,920
Agility and action speed nice. Okay, not bad. Can't put any of that on try to dodge it a lot of boots down here

415
02:39:21,170 --> 02:39:31,670
18 pretty these things this is all crap. I don't even this is not even worth selling. Yeah wizard shoes

416
02:39:31,950 --> 02:39:49,809
Who's gonna buy that? No one's gonna I know I was gonna want to even take that from me. There are some

417
02:39:49,809 --> 02:40:28,030
I'm gonna try to get out of here. Did you come from? Where'd you go?

418
02:40:28,190 --> 02:41:21,430
What did you come from? Got Nigel the group over there. Boy, I'm mashing. I'm mashing it. That means I'm a friend

419
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:36,659
It doesn't care. It doesn't care. It doesn't care. He doesn't care. Oh my god. I had 50% HP

420
02:41:42,389 --> 02:42:11,180
Crouch and people will be friends that first was a rabbit animal just like I whatever I had didn't have very much help

421
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:16,190
I had like what half health I tried to do I pressed control too many times

422
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:25,290
I sticky keyed myself as somebody that was just easy to kill control control control control

423
02:42:25,909 --> 02:42:52,219
Kill that one. Oh nice. I'm so addicted to this game, but I can't win

424
02:42:53,899 --> 02:43:08,489
Frustrating get your ass away from me

425
02:43:09,860 --> 02:43:12,250
Just restart

426
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:31,559
Fucking pissed trying to the class. I want I need to get it at least one more. I need to get out one more time

427
02:43:31,559 --> 02:43:39,159
I'm not turning the stream off unless I survive again. I don't care if I'm here for ten straight days

428
02:43:39,299 --> 02:43:45,879
I'm not turning the stream off until I get out again. I don't care if it takes a hundred years

429
02:43:45,879 --> 02:44:00,479
I don't care if I turn to dust in this chair. Okay, we're good. This is not a bad place to spawn

430
02:44:19,319 --> 02:44:35,340
Explosion bottle. Why am I not doing the strategy? This is impossible. I'm never gonna do it. Everybody accepted right now

431
02:44:35,379 --> 02:44:41,840
It's never happening. I will never do it. It's just I mean they pack it up. This is not happening

432
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:45,430
It's never gonna happen. I escaped last time I said that

433
02:44:45,969 --> 02:45:09,149
Look at how much stuff is on that fucking goddamn cupboard. Oh hell

434
02:45:11,899 --> 02:45:18,200
That hurt a lot

435
02:45:18,200 --> 02:46:05,989
You didn't hit me you swung around my body you look at all this stuff. Oh my god. It's so many things

436
02:46:05,989 --> 02:46:14,250
I'm taking oh my god. That was a blue. I'm taking the I'm taking the whole entire antiques roadshow with me

437
02:46:14,250 --> 02:46:18,860
I have to get out of here now. I'm just gonna I'm gonna run to the middle. I'm gonna hide

438
02:46:18,860 --> 02:47:28,639
I'm literally gonna hide in a corner. What the fuck? Why do I hear so many noises? What is that? Oh, I'm so fucking jumpy

439
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:53,780
Hey, hey, hey, they back fuck you

440
02:47:57,309 --> 02:48:20,239
You piece of shit, no, I wasn't ready I wasn't ready I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. He scared the fuck out of me

441
02:48:21,399 --> 02:48:38,379
Oh my god, it's just like he appeared behind me and he my heart started to go fuck

442
02:48:38,379 --> 02:48:46,940
I had a full heel how but I am I gonna be like done

443
02:48:47,079 --> 02:49:04,920
How long does it take to heal every other heel in the game besides the health potions?

444
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:07,459
Is it like an instant heal? I'm thinking like it's a bandage

445
02:49:07,500 --> 02:49:15,000
It probably takes a long time and he's doing this like or back forward for back for back for back stab forward back for back

446
02:49:15,360 --> 02:49:30,100
He swings so much faster than me. It takes a good 30 seconds to heal with the surgical kits

447
02:49:30,100 --> 02:50:17,100
Yeah, was that a poison dagger too? I feel like it was it was poisoned. Oh, there's three things here

448
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:26,700
Never mind. You'll do an attack chain

449
02:50:26,780 --> 02:50:31,040
Yeah, but I feel like though it's me holding down the attack button

450
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:43,780
He'll stab me four times and I'm dead like I have to block so much shit in here

451
02:50:44,139 --> 02:51:20,370
Alright, why does out played by the AI the AI stopped moving and just sat there looking at me regardless of the loss rate

452
02:51:20,489 --> 02:51:29,110
Well, I mean it's the first day I've ever played it. Give me give me a break. I've never played this before

453
02:51:29,110 --> 02:51:36,540
This is the first time I've ever played a video game as I'm an actor. I'm an actor. I don't play video games

454
02:51:36,540 --> 02:52:41,579
I'm an actor stop. All right, let's do it. I'll change classes after this. I'll try the I'll try the Ranger Ranger rules

455
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:50,239
Did I get it? I did. Okay Ranger is snooze

456
02:52:50,239 --> 02:53:14,120
Um, I would want to try it at least once Rangers not great solo

457
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:32,969
I feel like this is a great solo class to be wrong. Is that incorrect rogue is wizard is crazy

458
02:53:33,370 --> 02:54:13,250
Solo really you like spaghetti. This is my only question. Yeah, I love spaghetti. I'll be taking that one. This looks like a trap

459
02:54:13,250 --> 02:54:25,559
I'm wait. It's not on the mini map. It's not on the mini map. Where is it on the mini map?

460
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:48,840
It's not on the mini map. It's not on the mini map. I think I'm all right

461
02:54:48,940 --> 02:55:07,340
I'm

462
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:13,280
Help help. I won't fight you. I won't fight you. I won't fight you. Let's work together

463
02:55:13,379 --> 02:55:20,399
I'm not gonna fight you. Look see I haven't swung at you. I'm protecting you. I'm helping. Let's go. Let's get out of here

464
02:55:20,500 --> 02:55:38,270
Yes, I feel like he's gonna hit me. Well, I keep like I don't know

465
02:55:38,270 --> 02:55:47,760
I feel like he's gonna hurt me. We should probably be Wow. Okay, cool. All right, we need if we gotta find a portal

466
02:55:47,760 --> 02:56:28,750
We gotta get out of here. It's bugleberry. Should we try to kill the boss? What is going on here? Hey, stop hitting me

467
02:56:28,750 --> 02:56:36,489
Why is he hitting me? Why is he hitting me? Wait, who's wait? What was a different person? It was a different guy

468
02:56:36,969 --> 02:56:48,200
What do you mean? That's a different guy. It looked exactly the same. It was the same person. That was a different guy

469
02:56:48,520 --> 02:56:54,250
They had the same exact clothes on it was the same person

470
02:56:59,909 --> 02:57:09,000
All the classes look the same, but yeah, but they had the same robe on they had the same staff

471
02:57:09,319 --> 02:57:17,239
No, they didn't he had like a club. I don't whatever I he was behind me. I turn I turn around he's right there

472
02:57:17,299 --> 02:57:30,579
I'm thinking that's my buddy with the fucking magical shit. Okay, maybe it was a trap. Maybe he lured you into it

473
02:57:37,180 --> 02:57:49,059
Damn it. I need to I spent all my money. I have like five gold. Yeah, I I kind of just I see a

474
02:57:49,899 --> 02:57:55,739
Bugleberry walking towards me. I'm like, oh, that's bugleberry because he was just he was right there a second ago

475
02:57:55,739 --> 02:57:59,940
And then I get hit in the head with a fucking mace. It's like wait, what's happening?

476
02:58:00,739 --> 02:58:05,110
Why is everything going dark my head hurts?

477
02:58:17,139 --> 02:58:39,670
So bad there's a diamond

478
02:58:41,120 --> 02:59:18,100
Just leave right still alive run now run now run now run now

479
02:59:18,700 --> 02:59:35,059
Okay

480
02:59:35,100 --> 03:00:53,430
Bugleberry, okay. I've got a diamond good work. You could take that loot. I'm a fucking good guy like that. Yeah, I know I get it

481
03:00:53,829 --> 03:00:58,450
See, it's not just me. Don't make you make fun of me. It's not just me. It's not just me

482
03:00:58,450 --> 03:01:12,149
Everybody gets hit by that shit. He's dead

483
03:01:22,370 --> 03:01:24,370
Right now

484
03:01:26,950 --> 03:01:31,190
I can't do this right now. What happened? I feel so bad

485
03:01:32,190 --> 03:01:33,590
Oh

486
03:01:33,590 --> 03:02:09,379
He's got like fucking jewels on him though. I give me a portal get me out of here already. I got I have like stuff

487
03:02:09,379 --> 03:02:22,940
I'm okay. I'm just I'm gonna find a portal. I'm just going to the middle. This is gonna be awful

488
03:02:22,940 --> 03:02:25,940
Look, we're in this room this huge

489
03:02:25,940 --> 03:02:36,680
Look at all this verticality all this bullshit camp in the middle until the circle closes in in the portal spawn

490
03:02:36,719 --> 03:02:38,959
That's that's kind of the goal right now

491
03:02:38,959 --> 03:03:24,659
I'm just gonna sit right here and no one's even gonna fucking see me. I need to go over here

492
03:03:24,659 --> 03:03:26,520
Okay, I'm going in here and I'm gonna hang out in this one

493
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:35,590
This is where I'm gonna just sit turn all the turk close every door and turn all the torches off

494
03:03:35,809 --> 03:04:19,450
One person has escaped one person escape portals appeared you fucking piece of shit. I would die. Yeah, that's how he died

495
03:04:19,750 --> 03:04:39,879
Where is it? Come on. Is it above me or something? I'm gonna go up. Oh, I can't I can't do it

496
03:04:39,879 --> 03:04:43,559
I can't do it. I can't do it. I'm gonna die if I go up

497
03:04:43,739 --> 03:05:06,920
I don't have any more healing potions you have to this game is so fucking hard

498
03:05:07,020 --> 03:05:12,840
the fact that you have to find one of these portals and it could be anywhere and like

499
03:05:14,579 --> 03:05:31,959
Go so that so there was one portal somewhere in that area

500
03:05:32,760 --> 03:05:46,549
Somewhere I mean I was just down I went up but the thing is already there

501
03:05:46,610 --> 03:06:00,250
If you waited another portable to spawn you were the last person is there any way I can see that or is it?

502
03:06:00,250 --> 03:06:05,940
I just keep track of the kill feed. How would I know? I'm the last person does it tell you?

503
03:06:12,389 --> 03:06:19,370
I kind of just want to die so I can just start the maps. Oh, I'm wearing them out

504
03:06:19,370 --> 03:06:26,110
I see the timer does it show player count? I'm done. I'm dead

505
03:06:26,110 --> 03:06:38,860
I'm just trying to see like where is there an indicator? It's on top now that one doesn't count

506
03:06:38,899 --> 03:06:50,190
So let me I got a question

507
03:06:50,190 --> 03:06:56,639
So even if everybody is dead you're dead too if you don't go in one of the random portals

508
03:06:57,299 --> 03:07:38,030
Everybody's dead. You still have to leave the same fortnight focus on just finding a portal, you know

509
03:07:38,170 --> 03:07:39,370
Yeah, I'm not gonna find one till late game

510
03:07:39,370 --> 03:07:47,450
So is it a certain minute wise or a certain how big the circle is the one the one thing?

511
03:07:47,450 --> 03:07:50,450
I'm getting confused at is so I was the last person left there

512
03:07:50,530 --> 03:07:56,040
How come the oranges portals everywhere in that because remember like three or four games ago?

513
03:07:56,360 --> 03:08:12,600
There were like five portals in the middle at the end. It's just based on time. It was map size

514
03:08:14,299 --> 03:08:23,899
In the goblin caves only three portals open up every time only three people could leave my god

515
03:08:23,899 --> 03:08:54,989
That sucks. It's based on how many players are there is this well somebody's walking not that person by the way

516
03:08:54,989 --> 03:09:33,719
I heard something. No, I'm telling you. It's not this person. Okay. I got a pretty good helmet ten goddamn minutes

517
03:09:33,719 --> 03:10:24,170
I get it all I'm kind of in the middle already. So now just go up

518
03:10:29,309 --> 03:10:42,469
Where is up? Somebody was here. There's something is anything on the on the mini map look like a staircase

519
03:10:42,469 --> 03:10:47,690
Like what does the staircase look like on the mini map? I don't think it looks like anything. Okay, I'm up now

520
03:10:47,709 --> 03:11:17,489
I always make a habit of crouching in hallways not a bad idea nice alright besides my weapon. I've got I'm alright

521
03:11:17,489 --> 03:11:43,860
I've got some pretty good stuff. Why am I going down? Oh, okay? Never mind after this. I'm just going for survival

522
03:11:43,860 --> 03:12:06,399
This is a huge chest come on. Give me something give me something. Just let me hide. It's alright 49 pretty good

523
03:12:07,889 --> 03:12:09,649
23 33

524
03:12:09,649 --> 03:12:21,069
Get rid of that crap get rid of this bow to fuck this thing get rid of this tunic. Okay, all right all right

525
03:12:21,090 --> 03:12:24,250
It's time to escape with the jewels and the gems. Oh

526
03:12:36,889 --> 03:13:32,309
No, okay a portal is out. There's a magical sword in there. Can it jump over? Oh?

527
03:13:36,340 --> 03:13:52,540
Goff I want whatever that is. Oh

528
03:14:04,850 --> 03:14:13,100
That's pretty good. Oh, I'm so bad at inventory management

529
03:14:13,819 --> 03:15:22,079
We friends if you careful be careful. Whoa, that's dangerous up there. I don't get through this

530
03:15:22,360 --> 03:16:09,489
Why can't I get through that equip the sword? I can't on I need a portal look for the portal

531
03:16:09,549 --> 03:16:28,879
That's what I'm doing. I'm telling you. I'm looking for one right now. Is that one right there might be get me out of here

532
03:16:28,879 --> 03:16:31,909
Get me out of here. Get me out of here. Get me out of here. Get me out of here

533
03:16:31,909 --> 03:16:38,409
Get me out of here believers. We made it second time tonight

534
03:16:38,409 --> 03:16:49,920
Oh, that's so stressful needing to go find one of these fucking things

535
03:16:49,959 --> 03:16:58,530
It's so stressful because you just don't know where it is and there's so many people that are trying to kill you

536
03:16:58,530 --> 03:17:04,719
Okay, I did get some decent stuff. I should be able to sell some of that

537
03:17:04,760 --> 03:17:17,719
I'm gonna put sunglasses on so many emotes. Yeah, you earned it you earned it

538
03:17:17,719 --> 03:17:37,329
Did a fun game it is it's very addicting. It's very very hard though. It's a game where one

539
03:17:37,930 --> 03:17:47,819
Single mistake will just delete all the stuff you have and I am very prone to mistakes

540
03:17:47,940 --> 03:17:51,450
So take that as you will

541
03:17:51,450 --> 03:18:05,739
Yeah, I was gonna maybe party up with some people but I wanted to make sure I actually liked it first

542
03:18:06,219 --> 03:18:11,659
rather than get into a game with two or three people and it's like I actually really don't really like it and

543
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:41,079
20 minutes into the game be like, well, sorry guys, it's not for me and leave I think I can just exit right?

544
03:18:41,120 --> 03:18:55,180
It's not gonna hurt me. Oh my god. All right. Look at all this. I got a big battle axe

545
03:18:59,799 --> 03:19:16,600
Okay, but I haven't clicked on a merchant in four hours or whatever. It's been nice nice Jesus

546
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:40,450
76 bucks actually have money now. So the real question is is it worth me taking that perk to use this?

547
03:19:40,629 --> 03:20:06,889
No, so I should just sell it shield is better. Yeah, uh, I'm gonna hold on to these. All right

548
03:20:06,889 --> 03:20:15,100
I got 94 bucks. I get rid of this thing

549
03:20:18,170 --> 03:20:37,040
3323, okay, so we're gonna be conservative Andy if I have a decent one

550
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:39,239
I'm not gonna I'm gonna take the worst one

551
03:20:39,399 --> 03:20:46,700
we're gonna be conservative Andy here and I'm gonna take all my money in my inventory and

552
03:20:49,909 --> 03:20:54,819
Just cuz I really want to like flash my wealth around you know, I mean

553
03:20:55,000 --> 03:21:12,600
Yeah, I feel like that would be like I like somebody's little brother if you killed somebody in the head like a hundred gold

554
03:21:12,600 --> 03:21:26,219
On or something if they go you just don't you don't understand what's happening right now. It's gotta be nice

555
03:21:26,219 --> 03:21:43,840
I refuse to have a stash that doesn't look perfect. Okay now I might take some of this shit off depends

556
03:21:43,840 --> 03:21:57,190
All right weapons see those blue letters and it just makes me sad. Uh

557
03:22:08,860 --> 03:22:11,680
22 I could buy a

558
03:22:12,139 --> 03:22:38,430
Bowshian things pretty good don't buy weapons. I'm gonna buy it armor

559

Can I serve button I can do to compare or is no I just have to mouse over

560
03:22:44,229 --> 03:23:07,879
This is the same thing which is a little higher. Is there anything that I'm missing? Not really. Yeah by healing supplies

561
03:23:12,610 --> 03:23:22,649
NHP 15 HP this just way worse. Hold on three of these versus three of these that's an extra 15 health

562
03:23:23,969 --> 03:23:42,690
45 gold 15 HP over 20 seconds

563
03:23:45,280 --> 03:23:47,040
15 HP over 20 seconds

564
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:59,469
I feel like the bandage is just better but you can drink that and move around this one's cheap six now

565
03:23:59,469 --> 03:24:28,409
It's the same. Let's just do only one gold. I'll take it Taylor

Already blew it. See the problem is my I'll talk in a minute. All right. The problem is I

581
03:29:23,459 --> 03:29:30,049

585
03:31:52,450 --> 03:32:26,459
What if I'm a friend you probably have friends. He's probably screaming over discord right now. He's probably like hey, hey

586
03:32:26,739 --> 03:32:31,770
There's a guy here. There's a guy here. He's got good gear man. Good gear. No, I ain't fucking with that

587
03:32:31,809 --> 03:32:40,739
He's literally probably in voice chat right now with two other people that you imagine looking at this guy

588
03:32:40,879 --> 03:33:17,040
You look at what I got you're coming for me the portal. Oh, I can't use that

589
03:33:17,659 --> 03:33:32,229
Somebody said hey, dude, this dude's gear is ass. Let's ignore him

590
03:33:32,290 --> 03:33:46,190
Hey, this dude's gear is ass. Don't worry. No, no, no guys. Everything's gonna be fine. I've been watching this dude stream

591
03:33:47,120 --> 03:33:52,479
He's literally only escaped twice and he's been playing for four hours. I mean, he's probably gonna die

592
03:33:52,479 --> 03:33:56,899
Anyways, I kind of feel bad killing him. He's like one of these shitty streamers that like does not have play

593
03:33:56,899 --> 03:34:07,860
I feel kind of bad. He's lighting something on his hand

594
03:34:19,719 --> 03:34:55,170
Everybody has you have friends. Don't you I'm gonna go the other way. There's portals everywhere now where I'm sorry

595
03:34:55,190 --> 03:35:02,030
That fucking scared the shit out of me. I thought they were behind me. I really thought they were behind me

596
03:35:02,069 --> 03:35:48,920
There's so many portals. How have I not run into one? How have I not run into one actually hit me?

597
03:35:48,920 --> 03:36:36,799
I need my fucking torch. Oh, what's that sound sound? I heard when I heard it. Hey, hey, hey

598
03:36:36,799 --> 03:37:09,909
I heard I said, where is it? I heard one. I just heard it. Where was it? I hear them. Where are they? Where's a portal? Oh

599
03:37:13,059 --> 03:37:16,129
You

600
03:37:27,290 --> 03:37:49,079
That's more money I didn't think you could get any louder, I'm sorry

601
03:37:49,120 --> 03:37:57,420
All right for one second. I thought this was a three-part story like something

602
03:37:57,420 --> 03:38:00,739
This is like a cards on this character like he was eating something

603
03:38:00,739 --> 03:38:06,420
He ate it and it was gross and it hurt him or something. It looks like oh like I'm testing this and it's like

604
03:38:06,420 --> 03:38:15,000
Ah, I thought it was like the read for some reason for one second

605
03:38:15,000 --> 03:39:01,639
I was like, oh, he's like poisoned. He ate something story in 3x not bad. Nice. All right. What do you do with silver?

606
03:39:01,639 --> 03:39:14,879
All right, like silver. What do you what do you do with it? You got more perks? Yeah. Oh, check it out. You sell it

607
03:39:30,879 --> 03:39:44,430
That's pretty good. Nice 20 more bucks. Um, I'll keep the bear trap now. I have a really important question

608
03:39:44,430 --> 03:39:57,120
Do I buy this should I do it? It's gonna be a blue weapon

609
03:39:57,120 --> 03:40:04,020
I'm gonna lose it all of my money, but it'll be worth it cuz I'll have a blue in my inventory

610
03:40:04,040 --> 03:40:12,319
I'm not gonna equip it. I'm not equipping this. I just want to make sure I have a blue

611
03:40:12,319 --> 03:40:17,809
So if somebody comes to this stream and they see me at stash they go, all right, he's got a blue

612
03:40:17,809 --> 03:40:21,319
He's fucking all right. He knows that he's done. He's got a blue up there

613
03:40:21,319 --> 03:40:35,459
I was gonna I was literally just gonna leave the stream, but he's all right spend on utility so you can survive

614
03:40:35,780 --> 03:40:47,819
Do I sell this to him not interested in buying what it's a way again. Explain to me

615
03:40:47,819 --> 03:41:01,639
What it do with silver sell to the treasurer?

616
03:41:02,000 --> 03:41:19,540
Golden golden silver is my language by the one. Oh, wait a minute. Oh

617
03:41:19,540 --> 03:41:27,399
One is free five is 15

618
03:41:27,399 --> 03:41:40,100
Is it my getting scammed or is this just the exchange rate by a coin purse notice? It's just always three to one

619
03:41:40,100 --> 03:41:54,700
Okay. All right. This is really good much more money now

620
03:41:57,120 --> 03:42:39,059
120 bucks I can't even use this I should just sell it. I actually can't use it. Let's go again

621
03:42:39,059 --> 03:43:12,040
All right. Hold hear me out on this. I'm just going in naked because I don't know how to use this weapon

622
03:43:12,040 --> 03:43:29,450
I'm just going to naked. Okay. No. Yeah, why not? Yeah. No, fuck it

623
03:43:29,450 --> 03:43:38,159
Is it true that you spent a hundred dollars on the family guy mobile game? What year is it right now?

624
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:54,690
Asking that why are you asking that? Why are you asking me this? Do you want me to answer the question? Yes back in

625
03:43:56,479 --> 03:44:00,319
2013 or 2014 I may have spent

626
03:44:01,440 --> 03:44:08,920
$75 on the family guy the quest for stuff mobile game. I don't know. I just did it

627
03:44:08,920 --> 03:44:14,290
I didn't I did that didn't do it ever again. It was stupid. I did I I'm very

628
03:44:14,469 --> 03:44:21,750
I'm very ashamed. Well, no, no, I'm not it was no, I'm not I don't care. It wasn't a joke

629
03:44:21,750 --> 03:44:29,030
I doubt yeah, it's the only time I've ever done anything like that. I don't I don't care. We think I care

630
03:44:29,030 --> 03:44:44,069
I don't care. Yeah, I spent 70 bucks on a family guy mobile game. Okay, it was fun for it wasn't even it was just like

631
03:44:44,069 --> 03:44:57,420
It was like dopamine or something. I don't know. It was an iPad toilet game

632
03:45:10,780 --> 03:45:14,420
This is like this is like nine years ago, by the way

633
03:45:14,639 --> 03:45:33,170
I can't believe you spent $75 for toilet entertainment. Well, hold on

634
03:45:33,329 --> 03:45:41,430
It was like it was like five dollars at a time and then after I got to like near a hundred

635
03:45:41,430 --> 03:45:44,180
I was like, all right, I'm done

636
03:45:45,020 --> 03:45:47,399
And I uninstalled it

637
03:45:47,399 --> 03:45:53,920
It just I uninstalled it five. Yeah, it was I did five dollars

638
03:45:54,520 --> 03:46:13,319
Sometimes it's $75. So you wasted money. Yeah, I mean remember that's so much

639
03:46:13,620 --> 03:46:42,149
This didn't this didn't happen like a last weekend. Oh, that's a weird first swing. What this is really weird swinging pattern

640
03:47:10,399 --> 03:47:17,090
So what? Yeah, what let me ask you this what dumb what dumb things have you bought over the course of your life?

641
03:47:17,129 --> 03:47:34,530
I'm sure we all have stuff bro guys, bro guys, bro, guys

642
03:47:35,209 --> 03:47:39,559
I was gonna say guys. I'm naked like it's very cool. No, I'm not naked anymore. Let's go

643
03:47:39,559 --> 03:47:58,829
You want to fight you aiming that bow? Oh, I see you aiming that bow. Oh that hurt

644
03:47:58,930 --> 03:48:24,780
You get the whole fucking Wizard of Oz behind you. Come on, man. And that's why we did that

645
03:48:24,780 --> 03:48:38,059
What was that? Hold on people were betting when I went in there with a weapon. I've never used naked

646
03:48:38,059 --> 03:48:46,000
I don't know that was not. Oh, what a that doesn't sound like a sound investment to me. Hmm

647
03:48:46,000 --> 03:48:48,040
I think that's on the level of family guy

648
03:48:49,000 --> 03:49:11,760
Mobile game purchases, don't you think? All right, we're going for a real one this time

649
03:49:11,760 --> 03:49:31,409
Yeah, I I know how much people spend on mobile games

650
03:49:31,510 --> 03:49:49,399
Do I don't think I want to take everything like it's always a mistake to do that, but we got it

651
03:49:49,399 --> 03:50:08,909
We got to go. We got to go in right? We're gonna go all in I have money. Yeah, we're going in

653
03:50:29,090 --> 03:50:33,760
I want ever I want everyone to raise your hand in here. Hold on a minute

654
03:50:33,760 --> 03:50:42,760
Let's let's break this down very quickly. How many hearthstone card packs did you open get out of here?

655
03:50:42,760 --> 03:50:54,809
Get out get out of here. Get up. Just leave now. Get up. Get up. Get out of here. Get up zero

656
03:51:00,389 --> 03:51:02,389
Dude give me a break

657
03:51:02,389 --> 03:51:12,290
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get fucking do you want to know something funny? I know I did

658
03:51:12,290 --> 03:51:20,190
I may have spent more money. No, that's not is that true. No, I don't think so

659
03:51:20,190 --> 03:51:32,520
I don't really spend that much money really don't okay. I think I'm ready to go

660
03:51:32,680 --> 03:51:48,700
I'm gonna take some of the good shit. Let me do my perks kind of like that

661
03:51:48,700 --> 03:52:00,180
I've spent over two hundred dollars on Pokemon cards

662
03:52:00,219 --> 03:52:11,620
Yeah, I I mean that some of the mobile game stuff is just clicking on a house to collect coins

663
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:30,170
So that's a little different. I'm going in I split I spent over three hundred dollars on planetside to cosmetics. Yeah, whatever

664
03:52:30,530 --> 03:52:39,110
Hey, whatever. Yeah, it's hey you hey, what whatever you want to spend your money on it's up to you

665
03:52:39,149 --> 03:52:54,659
You've based just don't go overboard with everything spend you buy whatever you want

666
03:52:54,659 --> 03:53:13,379
You got if you've got some money that you want to spend on something go for it. Don't go overboard. Yeah, I

667
03:53:13,899 --> 03:53:20,500
Somebody just said it. I it's people are acting like I spent 50 grand in the family guy

668
03:53:20,979 --> 03:53:37,510
Mobile game a lot. Oh, I gotta get this shit before the look

669
03:53:37,510 --> 03:53:40,670
I'm right in the middle so many parties of free you're gonna waltz in here

670
03:53:40,670 --> 03:54:07,420
I gotta get everything and run away. I can't believe you spent

671
03:54:08,700 --> 03:54:11,540
150 thousand dollars on the family guy

672
03:54:12,139 --> 03:54:20,979
Mobile game you all right. What do you do? Are you doing that? He's everything. Okay. Hey, I told you that I knew it

673
03:54:30,739 --> 03:54:40,290
You play with a party where you get jumped by three people

674
03:54:40,309 --> 03:54:49,719
Well, you play solo and you fight the fucking goblin horde and lose everything's gone

675
03:54:49,719 --> 03:55:21,280
At least I have I still have money you didn't use II. I kind of was like not even any time

676
03:55:21,280 --> 03:55:24,360
I think I would have died well before the hill over time happened

677
03:55:24,600 --> 03:55:34,190
That rogue just got right up my face and was just like bap bap bap bap bap bap

678
03:55:34,190 --> 03:55:36,250
How do you how do I how do I what do I do about that?

679
03:55:36,250 --> 03:55:39,579
I feel like I feel like I couldn't do anything about that

680
03:55:39,700 --> 03:55:44,200
He was just like right in my character's character model just going step step step step step step dad dad dad

681
03:55:44,200 --> 03:55:48,280
What do you do hit him back?

682
03:55:48,739 --> 03:55:53,870
All right, just run just kill

683
03:55:54,469 --> 03:56:28,559
Hit a fucking mage with him. Did I cut my finger cooking any tips?

684
03:56:29,319 --> 03:56:34,799
Go to the doctor. How bad is it? It's bad. Go to the doctor get stitches or whatever

685
03:57:12,299 --> 03:57:32,129
Elton if there's gonna I'm telling you there's gonna be some Eve online shit with this game when it eventually is done and everything

686
03:57:32,129 --> 03:57:36,280
It's already and everything that comes out. They're gonna be people decked out in all

687
03:57:36,920 --> 03:57:42,059
Legendary fucking uniques and they're gonna lose and it's gonna be an Eve online moment

688
03:57:46,479 --> 03:57:52,000
There's gonna be one point where you're gonna get all decked out. You're gonna go into a lobby. You're gonna lose everything

689
03:57:52,399 --> 03:57:54,760
It's gonna be so sad

690
03:57:55,280 --> 03:57:59,239
I'm actually kind of happy that I'm not really doing that

691
03:57:59,239 --> 03:58:01,239
Well, and I'm not just keeping that many things

692
03:58:01,559 --> 03:58:07,930
Because I'm gonna get really attached to like a blue or purple and I'm going to literally stare at the wall for an hour

693
03:58:08,250 --> 03:58:20,760
If I were to lose it, there's a high roller mode for that. Yeah, the hundred goal to go in

694
03:58:21,620 --> 03:58:27,790
Sucks I would okay. I would definitely watch people do that. That's way too scary for me

695
03:58:27,790 --> 03:58:48,639
I'm just gonna pretend like I don't see this person. He's trying to get my attention so bad

696
03:58:48,639 --> 03:59:00,250
I watch this watch this, but I'm doing this for the joke. I don't care. He's probably like this kid sucks

697
03:59:01,729 --> 03:59:18,290
Like I guess I just saw him right like wait. Oh, are they watching the stream?

698
03:59:19,489 --> 04:00:01,389
Thank you. I appreciate it. I'll drop the spiders working together

699
04:00:01,409 --> 04:00:24,649
Hey, do you mind if I get all the jewels? Hey, thanks. Hey, do you mind if I get all the jewels? You know this guy?

700
04:00:39,930 --> 04:00:45,319
I'm just kidding. You can have it. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Have it you can take it

701
04:00:45,319 --> 04:00:50,850
You can have it. You can have it. You can have it. You can have it. How do I drop it, dude?

702
04:00:50,850 --> 04:00:57,790
I used to play Diablo 2. I don't fuck around. How do I do? How do I get have give back just drink?

703
04:00:57,790 --> 04:01:53,700
I just drag it out. What's he doing? All right. Well, I'm taking this wrong with me

704
04:01:53,700 --> 04:02:27,799
Oh, I find our way out of here. I think this is a different person. All right, let's go loot this shit

705
04:02:27,899 --> 04:03:06,420
We're definitely gonna get a portal. Oh, you're mining. Nice. Oh, it's friend, right guys

706
04:03:06,420 --> 04:03:09,020
It can be hard to tell all right portals here portals here

707
04:03:09,020 --> 04:03:24,780
I'm gonna go up right up portals are up portals are up portals up right you need to get out get out get out

708
04:03:24,780 --> 04:03:44,639
I don't know where like where's a portal down down. I don't see anything like wait

709
04:03:44,639 --> 04:04:03,340
Wait, do you actually mean that like I actually can't see it. Where is it? I think we're in trouble. What do we do?

710
04:04:03,459 --> 04:04:16,030
What do we do stone ramp? Well, these guys don't know where to go either. I just heard something. I heard it

711
04:04:16,129 --> 04:04:26,239
Where is it? Where is it? I dude everything has fucking collision. I I don't know where to go

712
04:04:26,239 --> 04:04:43,149
I just heard something up the ramp. I I'm gonna die. I think I'm alright. Hold on. You mean like up here, dude

713
04:04:43,149 --> 04:04:57,430
I like this mode. Where the fuck are they? Why did I wait so long?

714
04:04:57,870 --> 04:05:17,079
Dude, this this level is like seven thousand feet tall. Well, okay, I got trapped

715
04:05:17,079 --> 04:05:25,870
If you're outside the circle for more than like ten seconds, you're just dead. I thought I thought they were alright

716
04:05:25,930 --> 04:05:31,909
So apparently I have this incorrect they do not spawn directly in the middle

717
04:05:31,909 --> 04:05:36,870
I thought that it was like a ton of them like two three of them at the end will spawn right in the middle right in

718
04:05:36,870 --> 04:05:46,010
The middle of the circle right in the middle. That's not what happens. Never it's just RNG

719
04:05:46,090 --> 04:05:59,180
There's so many up and down in this level. How do you reliably know where they are?

720
04:05:59,540 --> 04:06:08,829
The regular mode is almost it's pretty much one level

721
04:06:09,090 --> 04:06:12,389
It's not like fucking a ten-story hotel

722
04:06:13,110 --> 04:07:12,370
Hold everything the awful start. I might just die and restart and poisoned just kill me

723
04:07:13,440 --> 04:07:42,010
This room is like a fucking million people in it. I was doing fine

724
04:07:42,010 --> 04:07:52,209
I just got somebody said I got so salty I uninstalled laughing my ass off kind of par for the course

725
04:07:52,209 --> 04:08:04,459
I think don't you think with this game? He was laughing his ass off. I

726
04:08:22,569 --> 04:08:29,040
Got so salty uninstalled

727
04:08:29,739 --> 04:08:31,340
I

728
04:08:31,340 --> 04:09:21,889
Thought I could kill him in three hits in the head. It's too magic

729
04:09:36,079 --> 04:10:01,540
He's already damaged boys. Let's go. Come on. Oh, you're gonna make my confidence go to zero or mage. Ooh

730
04:10:10,709 --> 04:10:48,340
Not a hurt. This is not a horrendous start somebody here. Oh

731
04:10:51,100 --> 04:11:45,520
Skeleton. Oh fuck German. Just go play slots

732
04:11:46,569 --> 04:11:54,959
What

733
04:11:56,559 --> 04:12:08,989
This is the one this is the one hey, I have made character progress I have like a hundred bucks

734
04:12:09,270 --> 04:12:16,540
Well, I mean I'll have 25 at the end of this after I you know

735
04:12:16,540 --> 04:12:39,620
I a little bit of family guy gold I would have walked into that trap

736
04:12:39,620 --> 04:13:12,790
Oh, I've completely forgot to play one of the other classes my bed

737
04:13:12,790 --> 04:13:51,500
I'll do after this a lot of money the penguin walking you can play this with some friends at a later date

738
04:13:53,170 --> 04:14:03,969
Probably I'm very I'm addicted to it. I'm addicted to it. Even though I can't do it. Oh

739
04:14:38,229 --> 04:14:47,200
My god, that guy threw a fucking bomb at me. What are you gonna do now? What are you gonna do now wizard?

740
04:15:04,979 --> 04:15:29,399
You're dude your nose got cut off such a shitty thing to be in what the fuck you hit me right in the fucking eyes

741
04:15:29,940 --> 04:15:32,180
He hit me right in the eyes

742
04:15:34,319 --> 04:16:21,139
Is there a hole in the shield fuck was that sound that was a mistake wasn't it? Oh, no, it's these two

743
04:16:31,729 --> 04:17:03,760
Powered shield on new class new class. Hold on one more try and I'll switch. Please. I'm losing everything

744
04:17:04,120 --> 04:17:11,229
Hey, I gotta tell you this is a casino tip or if we're here

745
04:17:11,229 --> 04:17:17,680
If you're at the casino and you're at the roulette table, and it's red hundred times in a row

746
04:17:17,680 --> 04:17:23,899
Just bet with the trend you're gonna be like, it's gonna be blitz gonna be black this time

747
04:17:24,020 --> 04:17:34,219
No, it'll be black this time. No, I think you should I think you should bet with the trend at this point

748
04:17:34,360 --> 04:17:41,530
That's a fallacy. Of course it is. Oh

749
04:17:43,209 --> 04:18:10,389
Gambling is just a fallacy. You missed one again. He hit me right in the fucking hair

750
04:18:14,500 --> 04:18:40,360
No, I'm not fighting this room. Well, this is a lot of stuff. I didn't see I can pull them individually might be alright

751
04:18:40,420 --> 04:18:42,309
That

752
04:18:42,309 --> 04:18:46,959
Get you have wall hacks like how would you even have?

753
04:18:47,799 --> 04:20:12,010
There are three more skeletons in here focusing you're dressed like your character

754
04:20:12,010 --> 04:20:37,000
I am NOT so there's a pretty decent amount of money. Okay, let me just loot bro. That garb is whack

755
04:20:37,000 --> 04:20:59,979
Uh, I've been here to this to you're to all this now find a portal and leave

756
04:20:59,979 --> 04:21:37,799
Um, I don't think they're even spawned in yet clean this up. There it is

757
04:21:37,840 --> 04:22:10,600
I'm going mess somebody up with that. This is it's such an interesting PvP

758
04:22:10,780 --> 04:23:16,190
PvP PvP. Okay, decent shield. I'm too junk junk. Alright, there's a portal you alone. You're not alone

759
04:23:16,190 --> 04:23:37,040
Goodbye. I hope nobody saw me. Oh fuck. Oh my god. Fuck off. Wait, are we fighting?

760
04:23:41,569 --> 04:23:44,209
I thought they were being non hostile

761
04:23:44,809 --> 04:23:59,639
They were kind of standing around for a second

762
04:23:59,639 --> 04:24:02,500
It was a full three or four seconds and I was like, wait a minute

763
04:24:02,500 --> 04:24:11,559
I I didn't hope they were like stream friends or you know what I mean? I didn't alright

764
04:24:12,059 --> 04:24:25,610
Let me ask the believer something I can't fight three people. Are we fighting? I know I was just whatever

765
04:24:25,610 --> 04:24:36,610
I went into this room. I thought I turned the light off. They all just barreled into the room

766
04:24:36,610 --> 04:24:40,510
I could have probably thrown down. I know I was just stuck

767
04:24:40,510 --> 04:24:48,020
It was over the mage is just enchanting fire sword on the barbarian and you got a

768
04:24:49,059 --> 04:24:50,340
monk

769
04:24:50,340 --> 04:24:53,079
Doing something else some type of shield buff. I don't know

770
04:24:53,500 --> 04:25:03,450
I'm just a guy with a fucking bottle of liquor in a lighter new class

771
04:25:03,450 --> 04:25:25,780
I'll do it after this is what it feels like to root for a losing sports team

772
04:25:26,180 --> 04:25:44,079
Yeah, but eventually they're gonna win the World Series and you're gonna be so happy when they do just might take

773
04:25:45,540 --> 04:25:59,219
70 or 80 years. Yeah, but that's also not a fair analogy considering

774
04:25:59,840 --> 04:26:06,250
Okay, it would be like if I was playing a basketball game and I was the only player versus a whole team

775
04:26:06,370 --> 04:26:10,120
They're like passing the ball back and forth

776
04:26:10,280 --> 04:26:31,639
They like slap in five and I and I'm running around in circles. When is that stream?

777
04:26:31,639 --> 04:26:41,829
Do you guys think that if I hired a professional basketball team to just go just versus me only?

778
04:26:42,430 --> 04:27:05,450
Would I score one point in a full regulation game? What do you think? I didn't know you don't think so

779
04:27:05,469 --> 04:27:09,340
I think I would do it. I think I could actually do it

780
04:27:11,540 --> 04:27:16,020
What scoring one basket?

781
04:27:23,819 --> 04:27:31,579
Can you just see in your head a team of like seven foot tall basketball players and me as like five eight Andy

782
04:27:31,579 --> 04:27:35,729
I would go to shoot the ball and they would just just

783
04:27:36,370 --> 04:27:43,239
Absolutely, just spike it down. Yeah, I would have to get a foul shot. I would have to get

784
04:27:43,600 --> 04:27:46,950
I would just be flopping. You know what I mean?

785
04:27:47,170 --> 04:27:51,040
Somebody would get it. I would run up and do go for a dunk and I would flop and be like, oh

786
04:27:52,479 --> 04:28:01,280
Well, I was too that was too hard and then I get a chance

787
04:28:01,799 --> 04:28:09,770
Your five eight was shoes. You don't think I'd be wearing shoes. I'll be wearing like basketball shoes

788
04:28:10,989 --> 04:28:28,280
What?

789
04:28:28,280 --> 04:28:35,579
No, no, that doesn't count either. I want that health back. I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna wait till that health is back

790
04:28:35,579 --> 04:29:09,489
I'm waiting. I'm gonna wait till it's back. It's going in the review. What's happening right now?

791
04:29:09,590 --> 04:29:31,450

826
04:35:29,650 --> 04:35:48,209
Oh

04:35:48,209 --> 04:36:04,400
God damn it. That probably looks so stupid. Holy shit. You're a jester

828
04:36:04,400 --> 04:36:07,119
You started using a funny voice and your survival rate

829
04:36:08,040 --> 04:36:23,380
skyrocketed

830
04:36:23,619 --> 04:36:38,529
Said peaky blinders. All right, let me get another one in can I get another real try one in your last words?

04:36:38,529 --> 04:36:58,169
Yeah, clout. Yes. All right class class class class. I'll play is a different class. So Ranger everyone saying what about wizard?

832
04:36:58,229 --> 04:37:13,360
You know, I got to turn my mic off. Yeah wizard you want to do wizard. Trust me

833
04:37:13,360 --> 04:37:56,509
I'm an ice and frost and fire and oh it resets every time. Okay. I don't know how to play with the wizard

834
04:37:56,509 --> 04:38:09,119
We're just gonna walk around so I have a staff you have to stand still when using spells

835
04:38:09,119 --> 04:38:24,560
Okay, it never turned on they couldn't hear you good. It was the little indicator down the lower left

836
04:38:24,639 --> 04:38:30,349
Yeah, they were like they were answering questions. Did you do a wizard voice?

837
04:38:32,139 --> 04:38:41,840
All right, let me see here. So this is a swing

838
04:38:42,000 --> 04:38:52,419
We select a spell from your memory to cast fireball slow haste invisibility magic missile

839
04:38:52,540 --> 04:39:13,759
Okay, so I fires pretend home. So is that on? Okay, do a Deckard Kane RP

840
04:39:14,770 --> 04:39:21,119
Maybe maybe another minute or two. They've been a minute. Does the mage does not have a torch

841
04:39:21,119 --> 04:40:14,470
Oh, yeah, I can't wear any of this, you know, just throw one down easier that way. Ooh, what's that ancient scroll?

842
04:40:14,610 --> 04:41:04,659
That was a wizard thing. I'm doing this wrong. Oh wizard battle. That's actually really fun

843
04:41:04,939 --> 04:42:15,590
What happens if you run out of spells? Oh, that hurts me. Oh, this is a trial run. This is a trial run fuck

844
04:42:15,909 --> 04:42:47,250
Using everything I have here

845
04:42:48,009 --> 04:43:25,479
I'm in trouble now. Is there a heel? Oh, that's the other that's the other caster. What does haste do faster?

846
04:43:25,479 --> 04:43:48,110
You don't really tell you meditate to recharge. Is that a certain button combination? Oh really vulnerable here really vulnerable

847
04:43:48,169 --> 04:44:01,349
Oh, it's only one recharge

848
04:44:01,750 --> 04:45:11,759
Your headshots matter with that or no, they do. Oh big pog move the big chest. I don't think I can

849
04:45:24,299 --> 04:45:32,619
All right, I'm just gonna try to get out. I'm just gonna try to survive

850
04:45:32,779 --> 04:46:04,319
Okay, the goal is just just try to get the hell out of here portal. Get me out. Oh fuck

851
04:46:08,520 --> 04:46:52,799
Don't mind me. I'm not sure they saw me. I'm just running around looking rooms for portal. Oh, I feel like there's one in here

852
04:47:08,779 --> 04:47:25,659
Thank God, I didn't see what it was. It was a ranger 15 armor plus two magical heal. Wait, I could I can wear it

853
04:47:25,659 --> 04:47:35,139
No, I can't so okay if you find a good item like this for another class

854
04:47:35,139 --> 04:47:44,939
I can't it's not a shared stash, but I can trade it to

855
04:47:45,419 --> 04:47:56,029
Myself or just trade it you trading post it to others

856
04:47:56,150 --> 04:48:13,000
Do not sell blues to NPCs trade them to the other players in the market really you would that's so cool. That's so cool

857
04:48:13,020 --> 04:48:22,279
I'm gonna fill my inventory with blues

858
04:48:22,400 --> 04:48:35,159
I'm gonna sit in the fucking trade server and just drink like six Mountain Dews and just trade like hats for refined and shit

859
04:48:35,159 --> 04:48:55,180
All right, made it out alive

860
04:48:55,900 --> 04:49:19,189
We go all this other stuff is kind of trunk trunk trash and junk combined

861
04:49:19,189 --> 04:49:41,090
Are there other spells besides the one that they're more spells?

862
04:49:41,250 --> 04:50:20,610
This is the coolest part of this whole game by the way, but this is by far the coolest thing the menus

863
04:50:20,610 --> 04:50:27,700
Yeah. All right. Let me look at my spell

864
04:50:28,180 --> 04:50:49,979
Here was zap. Wait, what is this? I don't get it. Good night skill one skill two

865
04:50:50,419 --> 04:51:00,360
Spell memory priority, you'd have two sets of spells equipped, but it sucks

866
04:51:00,520 --> 04:51:19,090
So just keep it on this keep it on one. Oh, I see the cost limit

867
04:51:19,610 --> 04:51:29,270
Actually haste is good for trying to run around and find stuff. I'll get rid of it. I just want all offense

868
04:51:29,310 --> 04:51:59,540
Let's try his app magic damage bonus melt. Oh, I want yeah this for sure 20% cast speed. Hell

869
04:51:59,560 --> 04:52:24,270
Yeah, can I get a hell yeah in the chat, please? All right, let's keep going. I made some money. That's cool

870
04:52:24,349 --> 04:52:39,619
Hell yeah, are you addicted yet?

871
04:52:39,619 --> 04:52:52,270
I've been addicted since probably the first hour this game does this thing where it lets you keep stuff and there's rarities

872
04:52:52,470 --> 04:53:05,619
It's it's just kind of scratch that itch for a ton of people addicted but bad

873
04:53:05,779 --> 04:53:13,220
Hey, where does it say that you have to be good at a game like this to enjoy it? I've done I've done

874
04:53:13,220 --> 04:53:23,380
Okay, I didn't mean to do that. They're not allowed to make fun of me

875
04:53:23,380 --> 04:54:35,169
It's my stream that count as a spell this wizard sucks, dude. You kind of stink at this Jesus somebody die

876
04:54:35,689 --> 04:54:57,889
Holy shit, that was a weird 3d movie

877
04:54:57,889 --> 04:55:07,909
Um, okay

878
04:55:07,909 --> 04:55:33,590
So that takes a lot to kill things if I had voice chat on I was gonna be like don't fucking do that

879
04:55:33,590 --> 04:55:38,720
So what would some of us are trying to look at our menus and we don't want sounds to have be in our ears

880
04:55:38,840 --> 04:56:04,479
Don't fucking do that. That's BM majors PvP. Do some more RP. All right fine. Oh

881
04:56:11,979 --> 04:56:20,810
Goodness me. No, if I say so myself, I seem to be

Excellent work. You sure do know how to use a sword

925
05:04:18,599 --> 05:04:26,619
I know quite a few people that would be very interested in how you are using that weapon

926
05:04:26,659 --> 05:04:34,139
I'm from the adventurer's guild up north very far north

927
05:04:34,299 --> 05:04:51,610
It's very chilly where I'm from as you can see I'm wearing all these robes down here and close that door

928
05:04:51,869 --> 05:05:05,860
Even wanted anybody to be sneaking up on us. What is your name? Ah, Mike, I'll get this one

Would you mind if I meditated for just one moment, please? Ah

Refreshing adventure. This is probably a bad way to go. Oh my skin hurts. Yes. Yes, of course

We need to go this way all the way looking for a diamond a crown made out of jewels

Grisness of adventurer. I'm gonna give you something and I want you to make sure you understand

This is a very expensive item and that's what you get for being on my team

940
05:06:48,360 --> 05:07:14,759
I'd venture up this way if you see a portal by any chance, please. Let me know. I'm so old

941
05:07:14,759 --> 05:07:23,610
I should be the one to go first. Yes, of course. Yeah, what a nice young man. You really are

942
05:07:23,610 --> 05:07:40,069
Oh, they think that they can use magic on us. Don't they how does that sound?

943
05:07:51,990 --> 05:08:04,150
I hope he gets out with that blue. I really do

944
05:08:08,279 --> 05:08:15,979
Failed that guy fucking hated you. I don't think so. He's got a blue. He's got a blue. He's getting out of there

945
05:08:15,979 --> 05:08:32,049
All right, one more RP and then I'm gonna go back to plan this time

946
05:08:32,049 --> 05:08:53,849
I'm gonna be a dark wizard. Well, that's when you that's when you turn it off

947
05:09:24,000 --> 05:09:26,220
Well, let's play

948
05:09:26,220 --> 05:09:42,240
Unfortunate fireball. What is the range for this to actually hurt me? Am I in a cell? Oh my goodness

949
05:09:42,259 --> 05:10:14,080
I went into a cell. How did I back into a cell? What was that? I didn't hit apply. It looks like it was off

950
05:10:14,080 --> 05:10:43,209
That's pretty good stuff. Is there a heel that way? This is oh, this is a heel. Is it a full heel?

951
05:10:50,209 --> 05:11:00,959
Somebody kill me. What's that? Did I kill him? Did I just kill myself because of the magic missile? Oh

952
05:11:02,840 --> 05:11:05,139
Dear oh me oops

953
05:11:05,540 --> 05:11:23,360
Accidentally magic missile to ground. All right, this one's for real. Let me try. Hold on. Let me try the Ranger

954
05:11:23,419 --> 05:11:35,450
I feel like the wizard is really really awesome, but I think you really have I think you need to be like a little

955
05:11:36,209 --> 05:12:06,220
More familiar with the whole game range. Yeah, range. Yeah, it seems really cool though. This seems like the the kid is really fun range

956
05:12:06,220 --> 05:12:29,250
Yeah, no range. Yeah free. How does this work detect recent enemy footsteps? That's cool

957
05:12:29,569 --> 05:12:46,159
Forage food light speed projectiles a greatly increased in addition physical attack powers increase. Okay, that's cool. That's pretty good

958
05:12:46,540 --> 05:13:25,819
That's pretty good too 15% more headshot damage. I'll try that was the loadout the bow

959
05:13:25,979 --> 05:13:40,259
All right. Let me try it. The multi shot one is super good. How does it work? It's I get six shots you hold it

960
05:13:40,340 --> 05:13:46,409
There's a lot of drop on it though. Okay, that's a lot of drop

961
05:13:46,409 --> 05:14:11,659
I gotta be ready for that range of voice probably something like this if I were to say something like this

962
05:14:11,700 --> 05:14:24,680
You think you're so powerful waving around that two-handed axe. Okay, I don't like this

963
05:14:25,340 --> 05:14:43,779
Where why am I in vents? I don't have a melee weapon. Do I just eat wood off the ground? Oh that's okay

964
05:14:43,779 --> 05:15:27,080
Oops, how do I get out of here? Do you have infinite arrows? Oh, fuck you. Oh

965
05:15:35,240 --> 05:16:26,720
I kind of like it. It's kind of fun. Can I break this with arrows another pick lock?

966
05:16:26,720 --> 05:16:48,779
I don't seem to have any close range. This one's open pretty good. You can get a sword. Maybe I'll try it out

967
05:16:48,779 --> 05:17:46,759
Walk over here wizard shoes. Get him. Ah, ah

968
05:18:08,909 --> 05:18:09,950
Oh

969
05:18:09,950 --> 05:18:31,340
I'm to go holster the bow to go faster. Oh

970
05:18:41,869 --> 05:18:50,509
No, I want that chest. Oh

971
05:19:01,439 --> 05:19:25,819
Never mind. Goodbye. So the sacrificial altar. What do you do? What is that? Oh, no, this is bad

972
05:19:25,819 --> 05:19:29,619
I'm in a lot of trouble here. I gotta I gotta just drag them this way

973
05:19:45,209 --> 05:19:59,250
The teammate revive, oh, that's pretty cool. Okay, cool. Holy shit just run. What is that? I don't know. I'm dead

974
05:20:02,119 --> 05:20:11,459
Thousand there was so much shit. I'm dead. Yeah. Goodbye. It was like a thousand spiders in that room

975
05:20:11,540 --> 05:20:24,529
There's just so many people. There's so many things close the door behind you. Yeah. Yeah, I know I know

976
05:20:24,889 --> 05:20:32,509
Honestly, I just trying to get used to how to shoot the bow

977
05:20:40,459 --> 05:21:05,459
Triple shots amazing. It's gonna land some headshots on some people. I want some garlic bread. Um

978
05:21:09,319 --> 05:21:17,909
You know, what's really weird and I've never said this out loud. I don't think anyone's ever heard me say this

979
05:21:17,909 --> 05:21:27,409
You know what? I want a steak. Is that weird? I want a steak right now

980
05:21:28,959 --> 05:21:38,680
I haven't eaten a steak. I mean when we're talking about like a fork and knife. I want a steak like

981
05:21:39,439 --> 05:21:50,540
Steak, I think it's been probably 10 to 15 years since I've said that I don't really eat steak

982
05:21:50,700 --> 05:22:04,459
Yeah, I'm not sure what put me in a steak mood

983
05:22:04,540 --> 05:22:10,860
Yeah, no, it's been probably at least at least 10 years since I've wanted to eat a steak

984
05:22:10,860 --> 05:22:28,349
I guess I could just sit up here and just sniper. Ah

985
05:22:29,590 --> 05:22:44,180
Oh, that's good, but I'm gonna have to wait

986
05:22:44,279 --> 05:23:13,250
I was saying it a lot last night because the eternal cylinder. Yeah, you're right. All right, you look ridiculous

987
05:23:13,650 --> 05:23:22,240
Can you die already if you got low iron? Hmm. That's an interesting theory

988
05:23:22,279 --> 05:24:05,479
What's the netcode like on this? How much should I lead people pregnant cravings?

989
05:24:05,479 --> 05:24:10,750
Um, no pregnant craving would be if I were to say I want a steak

990
05:24:10,830 --> 05:24:33,580
But I want you to marinate it in cool whip first somebody else here they together who you shooting at who you shooting at

991
05:24:33,599 --> 05:25:04,430
Are you shooting me? Yep. Oh god. Damn it. Um, okay, so

992
05:25:05,310 --> 05:25:20,319
People are fighting. It's I think that I think one's dead. Oh, you're coming after me, aren't you?

993
05:25:20,319 --> 05:25:29,419
I don't know how I survived that and really don't I got no arrows. I'm in trouble here. Yeah

994
05:25:29,540 --> 05:25:37,279
No, this is not getting out of that

995
05:25:37,279 --> 05:25:52,400
I mean, honestly, you should have just started killing the stuff

996
05:25:52,400 --> 05:26:08,720
We were both dead was like four or five enemies behind like right next to us first PvP kill of the night

997
05:26:08,720 --> 05:26:14,659
Well, that's not true

998
05:26:14,659 --> 05:26:18,599
That would be oh, I don't know how I'd feel about that if that was a accurate statement

999
05:26:20,520 --> 05:26:32,200
That's at least the third or fourth PvP kill of the night at least five

1000
05:26:32,200 --> 05:26:50,000
I missed some raids didn't I shit honey Goblin came in with a raid honey Goblin rated last night, too

1001
05:26:50,000 --> 05:26:57,029
And that's where if you're still here from that raid, which I see I think that was hours ago. Thank you

1002
05:26:57,029 --> 05:27:10,979
All right, caught it like three and a half hours late. You did not hit me with that

1003
05:27:13,389 --> 05:27:26,119
What is it going for your wing? It's horse shit, dude. Why are there so?

1004
05:27:26,819 --> 05:27:34,060
Many of you honest to goodness. What the hell I know I'm supposed to close that door, but I had to

1005
05:27:38,020 --> 05:28:21,279
What's going on? Okay. I'm fine. It's a little sloppy, but whatever what's going on

1006
05:28:42,110 --> 05:29:13,330
Welcome to odds right in the face a wonderful word of odds that class seems

1007
05:29:14,250 --> 05:29:46,310
Unbelievably good rogue is a hard time with mobs Rangers. Not a solo class

1008
05:29:46,310 --> 05:30:02,389
I probably shouldn't be playing it then the fighter I think the fighter is probably the class

1009
05:30:02,389 --> 05:30:13,840
I could try barbarian feel like that would be my speed big heavy swing hit head P break

1010
05:30:13,840 --> 05:30:29,020
Um, I'll probably I want to keep playing but it is getting kind of late. I want to get out one more time

1011
05:30:29,020 --> 05:31:44,020
I want to escape one more time shoot. Oh fuck

1012
05:32:12,639 --> 05:32:52,840
Terrifying. Oh shit. Somebody's here how to go just in case somebody follows me down here

1013
05:33:02,040 --> 05:33:12,490
Somebody's asking if there is a proper solo queue. There is there is a solo mode now. It's very very hectic

1014
05:33:12,490 --> 05:33:30,590
It's very scary. That's I would say it's very difficult. It's the game. That's the way they get the name of the game

1015
05:33:30,590 --> 05:34:03,569
It's not called easy and easier. It's called fucking hard and harder. Please. Let me loot these chests in peace, please

1016
05:34:03,610 --> 05:34:34,299
I'm still alive. That's a good thing 15. Wait, is it faster seven bow? Oh seven. Okay, I'll try it

1017
05:34:34,299 --> 05:34:50,060
That damage is pretty bad though. Your mom's sick. I gotta go to bed. I hope you feel better. Oh, this is bad

1018
05:34:50,060 --> 05:35:42,099
Yeah, I'm in trouble wrapping around. Give me a good bow. Give me a blue bow 29

1019
05:35:42,360 --> 05:36:03,680
Better. Oh my god. I thought I had an extra second. All right, give me a portal. Give me out of here

1020
05:36:03,680 --> 05:36:49,389
There is a person portal. That's way too that room is way too dangerous. Oh shit. I'm in trouble

1021
05:36:49,389 --> 05:37:22,259
I don't think I have any potions or anything. Do I could be worse. This is a good stream

1022
05:37:22,259 --> 05:37:30,220
Oh, I'm glad you think so. The game is very very fun

1023
05:37:32,150 --> 05:37:34,349
This is gonna be one of those games

1024
05:37:34,349 --> 05:37:38,330
I think that it's gonna have a lot of fans

1025
05:37:38,450 --> 05:38:04,599
There's gonna be a lot of people that are gonna be playing this very very frequently. I'm just gonna go

1026
05:38:13,709 --> 05:38:15,709
Oh

1027
05:38:16,250 --> 05:38:33,790
Very bad everywhere. I just leave another archer here. Oh, yeah. Come on. There's a portal somewhere

1028
05:38:33,790 --> 05:39:20,619
I don't really have very much. Yeah, I have some jewels. I have some stuff crouch. I step in my own trap

1029
05:39:21,880 --> 05:39:30,279
What just happened? I didn't know you could do that. I didn't know you could do that

1030
05:39:30,279 --> 05:39:35,099
I thought it was like it's mine. So therefore the game doesn't I didn't know you could do that. Ah

1031
05:39:40,490 --> 05:39:50,490
Thought it was mine. Yeah, and I even still tried to jump

1032
05:39:51,270 --> 05:40:00,540
All right, it's a fun class but I feel like it's a classy where you need to have like support, okay

1033
05:40:00,540 --> 05:40:27,119
I'll try but I'm gonna try barbarian for two times co-op with somebody

1034
05:40:27,119 --> 05:40:36,700
Um, that'll be probably something that has to be planned because it's um, it's very very late around almost the whole world

1035
05:40:36,779 --> 05:40:41,259
So I think that's something that hey you want to do this on

1036
05:40:42,020 --> 05:40:56,349
Thursday or something, right? I think that's got to plan it up a little it's 6 p.m. In Australia

1037
05:40:57,279 --> 05:41:07,650
Hey, hey ones in chat if you if you're if you're from Australia, where am I? Where are my Australian friends at? That's a lot

1038
05:41:07,650 --> 05:41:40,840
Wow, okay. I get it. I feel it. They're different swing. It's a sideways swing. Oh get out of here

1039
05:41:41,599 --> 05:42:06,619
This is a really bad place to spawn. Yeah, a lot of the it's a lot of people that are around right now. It's a lot of

1040
05:42:07,759 --> 05:42:08,919
Australia

1041
05:42:08,919 --> 05:42:27,750
Asia too, right New Zealand. Yep. So I'm yeah, but you're up to because you're probably waking up right now

1042
05:42:27,810 --> 05:42:38,619
I like the late-night crowd you guys you guys have been really really not like it didn't don't get me wrong. Hey

1043
05:42:53,930 --> 05:42:56,549
Thanks, I don't get me wrong

1044
05:42:57,029 --> 05:42:59,959
every time zone has

1045
05:43:00,119 --> 05:43:06,869
You know this this perks to every time zone. Well, this is the first time I've ever streamed like this

1046
05:43:07,389 --> 05:43:17,720
Somebody's coming. Oh, okay. Yep. Ow, you got it. Oh

1047
05:43:26,290 --> 05:43:28,720
Yeah

1048
05:43:28,819 --> 05:43:35,770
Yes, you lied to me you lied to me that is that is be a way this different person

1049
05:43:35,889 --> 05:43:41,049
What'd you lie? Why would you lie to me? You're the two. Oh, why would you do this to me?

1050
05:43:41,090 --> 05:43:51,200
Why would you do this to me trader trader? What the heck you lied to me?

1051
05:43:51,200 --> 05:44:02,080
You did the squat squat. I lied to was it a different guy. They would look like they were together

1052
05:44:02,360 --> 05:44:20,700
He was waiting for backup bunch of bastards. I'm telling you to a man party. Only one was friendly

1053
05:44:21,159 --> 05:44:32,919
Would you ever visit Australia?

1054
05:44:32,919 --> 05:44:40,750
Australia seems like equal parts one of the most beautiful remarkable places on earth while also being one of the most terrifying places

1055
05:44:40,750 --> 05:44:57,259
I would never want to go like I would want to experience Australia in a in a helicopter

1056
05:44:57,380 --> 05:45:04,310
You know what I mean? Like holy shit. Wow. Look at this. Look at how amazing this is. This is so beautiful

1057
05:45:04,909 --> 05:45:13,790
Don't let don't land though. Don't land. I hear there are spiders as big as two fists. I

1058
05:45:14,509 --> 05:45:17,779
Thought we'd fly over

1059
05:45:17,840 --> 05:45:49,259
Now is there a parry or no, is it just power all jokes aside though?

1060
05:45:49,259 --> 05:45:56,830
I would I would it's definitely on the bucket list the places that are interesting to me

1061
05:45:57,150 --> 05:46:10,580
Dude, you got a really wide swing. Yeah

1062
05:46:11,500 --> 05:46:46,869
Maybe barbarians not for me. This is a little harder than I thought it was gonna be

1063
05:46:47,229 --> 05:47:03,919
Japan's another one a lot of places in Europe to like you guys know

1064
05:47:03,919 --> 05:47:50,069
I've never left I've never left in North America for like any reason ever don't trust anybody. Oh, no. Oh, yeah

1065
05:47:51,040 --> 05:47:56,959
Probably eventually I imagine I'll do a kind of a world tour at some point

1066
05:47:56,959 --> 05:48:11,860
Maybe into my 40s or 50s or something world tour announcement. No

1067
05:48:15,750 --> 05:48:21,150
That's why I'm gonna be going to every major city in the world a

1068
05:48:25,180 --> 05:48:44,470
Hundred cities in a hundred days, you know what I really want to do

1069
05:48:44,470 --> 05:48:48,819
I just I just want to go into a bar in Scotland

1070
05:48:48,880 --> 05:48:58,529
Just like sit down just get whatever they have on tap and just have somebody just talk to me

1071
05:48:58,529 --> 05:49:10,599
You know what? I mean, I just want to sit there on that stool and just look over to the left and right and just like

1072
05:49:10,599 --> 05:49:44,779
What's what's your story? What's your story? Let me hear it. No bar. Yeah a pub. That's what I mean. It's very profound, dude

1073
05:49:44,939 --> 05:49:57,669
I'm serious though. I think that's like would be nice dude. Yeah, I just like said that's everybody be like, oh my god

1074
05:49:58,169 --> 05:50:06,139
He's he's so well traveled and he's so he just wants to like have a conversation

1075
05:50:06,860 --> 05:50:18,580
You won't be able to understand them, but I could nod I could nod

1076
05:50:18,939 --> 05:50:53,180
Don't cast a spell at me. Did you miss the legendary ancient scroll? I don't need that shit

1077
05:50:53,299 --> 05:51:04,240
Do you think I need the legendary scroll? No, give me two packs of cigarettes and a fucking axe. I'll be done in an hour

1078
05:51:17,909 --> 05:51:37,020
Get your whole fucking crew, huh? Get your whole crew out of here. Ah, ah

1079
05:51:42,689 --> 05:51:58,700
He was one hit I'm alive just so dark bro, you died to a friar

1080
05:51:58,860 --> 05:52:06,799
Hey his buddy jumped on my back and when it wasn't hey that was I that was 2v1

1081
05:52:34,259 --> 05:52:43,500
But yeah, I think there's a lot of cool places to see the thing about the United States if those you bet

1082
05:52:43,500 --> 05:52:49,200
It may not have ever been here. The United States is very very different across the whole country

1083
05:52:49,479 --> 05:52:59,830
It's almost like four or five different countries. There's so many wildly different climates wildly different people

1084
05:53:00,049 --> 05:53:13,540
It really does sometimes feel like a few different countries. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we got multiple Star Wars worlds stole that from chat

1085
05:53:13,540 --> 05:53:41,729
I don't really understand how to play barbarian. It's like I swing and then I just like oh fuck

1086
05:53:41,729 --> 05:53:45,860
Is there am I missing something here like I'm getting hit way too much

1087
05:53:45,860 --> 05:54:28,669
I'd rather eat 50 hot dogs or travel the world. Why can't I do both of those things?

1088
05:54:28,669 --> 05:54:44,869
You're thinking too limited here. I have to choose one. I would want it. I would travel the world

1089
05:54:47,340 --> 05:54:51,380
Yeah, you can get a hot dog whenever you want to get a hot dog traveling the world something

1090
05:54:51,380 --> 05:54:59,659
That's kind of a big deal. I could eat a hot dog every day for the next two months

1091
05:54:59,659 --> 05:55:08,630
I mean, I wouldn't want to do that, but I could but it's 50

1092
05:55:08,689 --> 05:55:25,819
Yeah, the 50 hot dog sounds like a punishment not a reward. Hold on. Ow

1093
05:55:26,340 --> 05:55:46,360
Alright, I'm gonna hurt. Alright, so I oh shit my bleeding. No, that would be unfortunate. I think I might be

1094
05:55:50,639 --> 05:56:12,009
Hold on. Yeah, give me a sec. Okay, so the issue that just happened. Damn, okay

1095
05:56:12,110 --> 05:56:16,619
So let me explain. No. Yeah, I am shit

1096
05:56:18,209 --> 05:56:23,180
Give me one second. I'm fine. Don't worry. So this is actually kind of funny

1097
05:56:24,580 --> 05:56:33,340
I'm a bloody nose right now and it's because there was a really hard ass booger in my nose and I just went to like

1098
05:56:33,340 --> 05:56:41,700
Kind of rub my nose and this really hard booger just hurt me. It's kind of funny in a way, but like fuck it sucks

1099
05:56:41,700 --> 06:01:51,430
I'll be right back. That's unfortunate. You're back. He ripped his own brain. I'll be right back. I'm back

1100
06:01:51,430 --> 06:01:59,659
So I didn't realize it wasn't at a BRB screen. I'm good. I have

1101
06:02:00,180 --> 06:02:14,099
Tissue paper stuffed up my nose. Hey booger boy. Yeah, can we see no?

1102
06:02:14,099 --> 06:02:24,840
I I got a I got a some I got some liquidation here. It'd be hard to drink this in my nose though

1103
06:02:24,919 --> 06:02:40,770
That's hard to do. Did you at least eat the booger bro?

1104
06:02:41,750 --> 06:02:44,549
What do you think? No, shut up

1105
06:02:46,110 --> 06:02:52,319
Time that person out for I don't know that few days. I don't know. Shut up. No, I didn't it's disgusting

1106
06:02:52,340 --> 06:03:03,220
That person for a week. Okay. Let me try I

1107
06:03:07,580 --> 06:03:37,950
Want to try let me go back to them the thing I was doing before even gonna play scorn. Let's go prepared

1108
06:03:37,950 --> 06:03:56,479
Let me just take all this stuff. I got plenty of money. I'll try this one more time. This is so hard though

1109
06:04:05,610 --> 06:04:12,220
Yeah, I don't really know what happened. It does get very dry out here. It's very cold and it's very dry in Vegas right now

1110
06:04:12,220 --> 06:04:14,810
I'm not really prone to nosebleeds

1111
06:04:14,810 --> 06:04:22,439
But I think there was just there was a one a little too hard in there and I rubbed

1112
06:04:22,439 --> 06:04:27,630
I got I do this thing a lot. I don't know if it's just something. I don't know. It's a call it like a

1113
06:04:29,490 --> 06:04:30,650
kind of

1114
06:04:30,650 --> 06:04:37,340
Compulsive thing that I do but I a lot of times I will pinch my nose and like kind of pull down a little

1115
06:04:37,459 --> 06:04:40,279
Just I kind of rub like pinch pulp. I do it all the time

1116
06:04:40,400 --> 06:04:46,389
You probably see me do it on camera a lot where I kind of like take my my index finger in my thumb

1117
06:04:46,389 --> 06:04:53,220
And I go like just rub pulp. I do it all the time. So I did that and

1118
06:04:54,950 --> 06:04:59,479
Caused a nosebleed somehow

1119
06:05:00,419 --> 06:05:09,090
That does sound like a really really suspicious way to tell everybody that as a nearly 40 year old man

1120
06:05:09,090 --> 06:05:17,909
I was picking my nose when you couldn't see it. Well, you see

1121
06:05:19,909 --> 06:06:27,770
All right, let's go I'm fighting the boss one two shit three hit combo. I got that

1122
06:06:35,430 --> 06:06:46,569
Against the wall

1123
06:06:46,930 --> 06:07:43,189
Don't even I'm fighting this don't hurt me not again fucking die. Oh my god. Damn it

1124
06:07:43,349 --> 06:07:55,900
I can't I can't back up back up back up bang into wall. Now you're in trouble

1125
06:07:55,900 --> 06:08:20,939
I have no idea if I was even close but whatever. Oh, yeah, I forgot I got attacked

1126
06:08:23,939 --> 06:08:45,380
75% just started aggroing stuff in the room and at that point it's just over. It's late

1127
06:08:45,380 --> 06:09:01,500
It is late, but I'm a late-night Andy now. Oh, I'm just gonna leave

1128
06:09:02,139 --> 06:09:24,000
Let's just go back in here. He's dreaming of that Scotland pub

1129
06:09:24,000 --> 06:09:44,659
You think it's the earwigs in your brain that are making you slowly nocturnal or earwigs nocturnal. Ooh

1130
06:09:55,279 --> 06:10:01,790
Okay, pretty good

1131
06:10:04,459 --> 06:10:17,619
Diamond back here or something get back here. Can I just hide here the whole match?

1132
06:10:18,659 --> 06:10:38,360
Unfortunately, I am NOT near the center. I want to take you one at a time, please

1133
06:10:38,560 --> 06:10:49,009
Don't you dare come together? He seriously hit me in the fucking head. Oh my god. Oh my god

1134
06:10:49,009 --> 06:10:56,770
I can't I I died in two arrows. Did he headshot me twice in a fucking row?

1135
06:10:56,909 --> 06:11:05,099
I died as I shot 15 arrows at somebody and hit him in the head 15 times and they didn't die

1136
06:11:05,099 --> 06:11:22,619
I got hit to a two arrows and I'm dead aim really high with the shield. It's awkward. Jesus

1137
06:11:23,259 --> 06:11:57,259
Crouch and aim stupid high. I like this comment you muppet. You keep costing me a thousand points

1138
06:11:57,860 --> 06:12:07,040
What's the statistics here? How many bets have there been and how many have actually how many have I won?

1139
06:12:07,040 --> 06:12:10,700
How many have I you know? Oh, I made it out for three

1140
06:12:11,000 --> 06:12:15,459
Like 30 those odds are very bad

1141
06:12:15,860 --> 06:12:23,590
You can't put it on double zero every time with the rule of table and when the dealer is like, oh, sorry

1142
06:12:23,590 --> 06:12:31,529
It's a it's a red 20. Yeah, you fucking muppet. Why is it not on the green one the one in one out of 35? Oh

1143
06:12:34,080 --> 06:12:41,000
Shit, I just blew my snot thing. I gotta put this back in

1144
06:12:41,720 --> 06:12:49,680
You're betting

1145
06:12:49,680 --> 06:12:52,400
Against the edge. There's an edge here and you're betting against it

1146
06:12:53,220 --> 06:13:00,580
Stop trolling it. I

1147
06:13:01,939 --> 06:13:08,700
I'm this game. Yeah, fuck you fucking muppet. Oh

1148
06:13:19,729 --> 06:13:28,189
I'm telling you stop that in green stop betting zero and double zero. It's not gonna come up

1149
06:13:28,189 --> 06:13:49,090
You need to you need to be betting a strategy bet, right? I'm gonna damn it. This one's so hard. Okay

1150
06:13:50,380 --> 06:14:06,299
I'm gonna do this one. You didn't even put a an English accent on while doing the muppet

1151
06:14:06,319 --> 06:14:09,409
I didn't I don't know if that person's English

1152
06:14:14,779 --> 06:14:23,479
So many people have lost money. We're okay right now. It is 270 K 4 million

1153
06:14:23,639 --> 06:14:29,759
It's not good. It's not good. The believers have been drained

1154
06:14:30,459 --> 06:14:40,330
Completely 200 K to 4 million. It's we're kind of bleeding out all the believers

1155
06:14:40,330 --> 06:14:45,130
I've actually kind of feel bad. I need some of these believers to get a big win here

1156
06:14:46,630 --> 06:14:52,549
Otherwise only gonna be doubters with them with the with the capital. I can't have that

1157
06:14:53,069 --> 06:15:06,939
I'm trying as hard as I can know. I can't have that. It'll just be all doubters. Let's go. I'm gonna turn it here

1158
06:15:06,939 --> 06:16:03,560
It is somebody's close. Oh

1159
06:16:03,759 --> 06:16:51,970
I'm in the left. There's still many archers in here. No, fuck you. Give me all your stuff

1160
06:16:51,970 --> 06:17:07,400
Give me everything you own. Stop rolling. Stop rolling. Stop rolling. What do you have? I took okay

1161
06:17:07,400 --> 06:17:12,569
I got everything actually don't need this shit

1162
06:17:12,569 --> 06:17:24,360
17 no, I have a lockpick which can get you fuck this up. I'm gonna be very pissed off at you

1163
06:17:24,380 --> 06:18:03,360
I need health though. I can't use the fuck. What's that? What's just why did the clock just appear whatever?

1164
06:18:03,360 --> 06:18:18,619
Okay, I I just I looked away for one second

1165
06:18:18,619 --> 06:18:31,299
I was like, oh, that'll be fine and cool lockpick. All right potions this I actually I have to get out from this one

1166
06:18:31,299 --> 06:18:48,080
I do look at all these trinkets and shit. I got to get out of here healing potions or something

1167
06:18:48,080 --> 06:19:05,299
Come on, they live. Thank you. What the fuck? Oh, it's a mage

1168
06:19:05,479 --> 06:19:48,619
What a little bubble time to go in a minute in a minute in one minute

1169
06:19:48,619 --> 06:21:13,020
There's one or is it to loot loot loot nice worth it. Oh, I'll take it something

1170
06:21:13,020 --> 06:21:27,479
Wait, did you make sure you fight as many monsters as you can? Hey, dude, I see what you're doing

1171
06:21:28,299 --> 06:21:43,369
Look at this little fucking place

1172
06:21:46,500 --> 06:22:36,340
That doesn't really help me. Nice. Okay, don't want to fight that. I'm just gonna go this way. Okay. All right portal portal is somewhere

1173
06:22:36,340 --> 06:23:11,500
We've got some dead bodies portal. I just heard one. Where is it? I just heard one. Oh my god

1174
06:23:22,959 --> 06:23:24,520
Yes

1175
06:23:24,520 --> 06:23:32,159
Believers believe it. I'm gonna call that and I'm an unbelievably clutch

1176
06:23:32,560 --> 06:23:44,479
Molotov to buy me the time to open the portal to get the heck out of here. Yes

1177
06:23:44,639 --> 06:23:53,869
Look at all this shit. Look at all this and I left I got it. Didn't I get out with something pretty nice?

1178
06:23:53,889 --> 06:24:11,979
I swear I got a oh the blue is the last round when I yeah, that was unfortunate huge payout

1179
06:24:11,979 --> 06:24:22,000
I'm actually so sad. Oh, well, the odds weren't that good. I would have oh no, I feel bad

1180
06:24:22,400 --> 06:24:42,900
You didn't win. Oh, oh no, everyone's sad. Well that that worked. Okay, let's get some money

1181
06:24:57,229 --> 06:25:10,180
Hmm. There's gonna be a lot nice nice nice nice nice

1182
06:25:13,349 --> 06:25:21,099
Ooh, ooh. Oh, yeah, this is big money now. Look at this

1183
06:25:22,889 --> 06:25:23,889
65

1184
06:25:23,889 --> 06:25:57,150
Gold who wants to buy this thing? I'm gonna actually hold on to this like a crystal ball is pretty good to have for a wizard

1185
06:25:57,229 --> 06:26:11,310
Hey, well, what if I play with a wizard? Who knows? Hey, I'm saving this for Holly

1186
06:26:12,049 --> 06:26:25,990
She's gonna play a wizard. Um

1187
06:26:26,590 --> 06:26:39,669
Only four gold and I feel like yeah, whatever those worth a lot

1188
06:26:39,669 --> 06:27:21,959
I've got a pretty decent amount of money now. Do I dare gamble it? Of course not

1189
06:27:35,750 --> 06:28:19,509
No, I'm saving it. Why do I have multiple torches? I will buy a weapon though

1190
06:28:26,990 --> 06:28:59,080
22. Hmm. None of these are any good. I got bandages. I'll buy potions though. I would why these here

1191
06:29:01,709 --> 06:29:02,909
19

1192
06:29:02,909 --> 06:29:04,150
health

1193
06:29:04,150 --> 06:29:23,540
54 that sounds just that's just like awful. All right, I'm gonna do another one, but I have perks

1194
06:29:23,580 --> 06:29:35,270
I have stopped bleeding. So that's good. Do a high roller. I am NOT ready

1195
06:29:35,270 --> 06:29:36,669
You want me to go into high roller looking like this?

1196
06:29:36,669 --> 06:29:42,569
I'm wearing an elf costume with a fish tank on my head

1197
06:29:42,689 --> 06:29:47,689
You want me to go into the high roller zone and get fucking one shot by somebody's legendary weapon

1198
06:29:47,689 --> 06:30:23,849
You just want to see me lose a hundred gold. Hmm. Yeah guys. I have a serving tray for a shield

1199
06:30:23,849 --> 06:30:32,479
It's gonna get attacked the legendary ice sword of the mountain and it's gonna crumble and it's gonna split me in half

1200
06:30:32,479 --> 06:30:39,310
All right, I'm just gonna do I'm just gonna go again

1201
06:30:39,310 --> 06:30:46,849
Actually like last one probably for the night because I mean I do you know, I am very very into it

1202
06:30:52,189 --> 06:31:15,569
He's never gonna say hi to smush. You know, the worst part about this is I really like this game and they're about to take

1203
06:31:15,569 --> 06:31:27,830
It away from me in like five days. They're gonna take it away from me

1204
06:31:27,830 --> 06:31:35,819
I wonder when the actual just kind of beta just like it's open and it's gonna be there for a while

1205
06:31:37,259 --> 06:31:40,720
I wonder when the beta actually will be because it's supposed to be coming out at the end of the year

1206
06:31:40,720 --> 06:31:55,610
Is that full on 1.0 right? This is just a play test. Yeah, I think it's in my personal opinion playing this

1207
06:31:55,610 --> 06:31:59,259
I feel like it's almost

1208
06:31:59,619 --> 06:32:28,310
At that point where I think they could probably slap a beta on it, but that's you know

1209
06:32:29,669 --> 06:32:33,349
Okay, I have to win this but that's also just me being selfish and

1210
06:32:36,720 --> 06:32:42,939
You know, I got I want to play it so that's you know me being selfish

1211
06:32:43,619 --> 06:33:08,919
What is that spider don't play Tarkov Tarkov is like this right same kind of idea but with machine guns

1212
06:33:08,919 --> 06:33:22,729
I actually prefer this than that. I prefer the sort of dungeon kind of medieval fantasy. He's here

1213
06:33:22,729 --> 06:33:28,080
I don't know what the hell he's doing. Oh, come on

1214
06:33:39,000 --> 06:33:42,779
There's no getting out of this I

1215
06:33:43,220 --> 06:34:13,459
Can kill your fucking priest? I'll be happy you have the best take sometimes

1216
06:34:13,459 --> 06:34:21,439
But then you ruin it by talking about drinking your own piss or something. All things must be balanced

1217
06:34:21,439 --> 06:34:45,110
What if I talked about drinking my own piss? That's I've never said that. Oh

1218
06:34:54,319 --> 06:34:56,200
I whatever yes, right

1219
06:34:56,200 --> 06:35:00,549
I said I was people gave me shit cuz I had a water filter and I was like, oh, it's great

1220
06:35:00,549 --> 06:35:02,389
And they were like, oh actually that water filter sucks

1221
06:35:02,389 --> 06:35:15,159
And I was like I'll piss in and drink it and I never did it. Yeah, I remember it's like

1222
06:35:15,159 --> 06:35:17,040
Oh, man, that water filter dude, it's like a scam

1223
06:35:17,040 --> 06:35:20,720
I'm like what he did like I could piss in this thing and drink it and it was like to do it then I was

1224
06:35:20,720 --> 06:35:23,369
Like I will and then I just got called out and didn't do it

1225
06:35:23,490 --> 06:35:48,840
I hate that you just hit me. That's so unfair

1226
06:36:16,990 --> 06:36:24,540
Somebody's shooting me with a bow and fucking arrow and I don't know if it's a person or if it's a monster

1227
06:36:24,939 --> 06:36:32,409
That's just not gonna happen

1228
06:36:32,569 --> 06:36:41,080
This guy's buddy just died and I'm just gonna absolutely

1229
06:36:41,799 --> 06:36:56,669
Scared this shit out of him here. Oh my god, your friend had nothing. Your friend had nothing. What the fuck?

1230
06:36:56,909 --> 06:37:11,360
Well, good luck cuz now we're both fucking dead. What was he invisible?

1231
06:37:11,919 --> 06:37:19,909
He's invisible, wasn't he?

1232
06:37:19,950 --> 06:37:27,000
Invisible, how long can they stay invisible? Are they actually invisible invisible? Or is it kind of rogues can go invisible?

1233
06:37:27,159 --> 06:37:41,450
How long does it last? It's until that way is it it's like shadow meld from Warcraft every day

1234
06:37:41,450 --> 06:37:55,599
I you know every day I just see how good this class really is about 20 seconds if they're stationary

1235
06:37:55,599 --> 06:38:24,130
I remember when a rogue used to kill me in wow, I would have a fucking mental breakdown

1236
06:38:24,130 --> 06:38:32,659
I remember just questing in like Stranglethorn Vale and you would hear that

1237
06:38:33,580 --> 06:38:36,500
Kidney shot of whatever wasn't just couldn't move and then it was like

1238
06:38:37,380 --> 06:38:47,259
Who and you stunned again and then that person would just sit there for like an hour and I would just get my body

1239
06:38:47,259 --> 06:38:48,740
And they would just do it again

1240
06:38:48,740 --> 06:39:05,509
Just like log off bro log off. I was that guy were you you're a real piece of work. I'll tell you

1241
06:39:05,509 --> 06:40:14,240
I just said the ceiling that's very good believers. Are you there? I'm proving my usefulness

1242
06:40:38,459 --> 06:41:02,290
Start is this is he just running around the circle turn the brightness down. No, I can't play it

1243
06:41:02,290 --> 06:41:10,049
I can't play it unless the brightness is up like 20 30 percent at least my eyes are so bad my you know

1244
06:41:10,049 --> 06:41:15,720
It's crazy my eyes when I'm looking at a monitor or worse than just real life

1245
06:41:15,720 --> 06:42:01,520
I don't know why that is boomer eyes. Oh shit. What happened to this person? Oh, sorry, man

1246
06:42:01,520 --> 06:42:15,360
I'll take this I tried to help him I did but this game this game is

1247
06:42:17,459 --> 06:42:35,709
This game is pretty pretty hard we leave me alone for one second. Oh my god, you fucking little shits. I'm gonna wrap around

1248
06:42:36,229 --> 06:43:32,889
I'm over here, man. Hey, it's a little slow. Dude. Where's Mike? Oh my god

1249
06:43:32,889 --> 06:43:39,720
I thought this is gonna be so much easier. I thought this is gonna be so much easier. Holy shit

1250
06:43:39,720 --> 06:43:57,479
That was a disaster. No, don't even please don't please please not right now getting kind of just destroyed at every turn

1251
06:43:57,479 --> 06:44:07,619
This is so bad. This is bad. I'm in trouble. Holy shit. You saved my life

1252
06:44:07,700 --> 06:44:18,770
Thank you for the love of God close this door for the love of God closer, okay

1253
06:44:20,330 --> 06:44:39,639
Okay portal. Oh dear careful. Careful. There's a monster behind you. I gotta be honest. Oh shit

1254
06:44:41,279 --> 06:45:08,380
No fall damage, right? Okay. Wait, I need a portal. What happened the mage act the goblin mage killed me

1255
06:45:08,380 --> 06:45:17,639
Well from that far away. I got sniped from that far away. He jumped down

1256
06:45:18,479 --> 06:45:37,229
Well, I hope you get this these items. That's sad

1257
06:45:37,790 --> 06:45:44,930
Alright, this is the last one. This one counts. This is the one that

1258
06:45:45,549 --> 06:45:53,580
Really counts this one counts. None of the other ones did I've been playing for about seven hours

1259
06:45:53,580 --> 06:45:55,619
These were all tutorials leading up to this

1260
06:45:56,299 --> 06:46:27,509
Exact one right now all led up to here. Hmm. What do you got you two are together?

1261
06:46:29,560 --> 06:46:33,909
What about you?

1262
06:46:33,909 --> 06:46:55,130
That means you need to refund all previous bets. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say that's not gonna happen

1263
06:46:59,360 --> 06:47:07,290
I'm getting out. I'm gonna leave here with like 300 gold. Let's do it

1264
06:47:07,290 --> 06:48:19,880
You should turn the monitor off for this one. That'd be actually really funny. The gas following me. Okay, I got some replacements

1265
06:48:19,959 --> 06:48:38,099
This is just junk, but I'll take it. Alright, let's keep going. I'm gonna actually go around your time

1266
06:48:38,139 --> 06:49:40,639
Is this poison somebody else's down here? It isn't poison. Thank goodness. Somebody's down here

1267
06:49:40,639 --> 06:50:44,650
You better not be full of shit. Nice the code. Yeah. Alright the the adventurer code. Alright, let's get out of here

1268
06:50:44,650 --> 06:51:23,979
Oh, he's meditating whoo you you coming or do you need help? Why am I talking like you can hear me?

1269
06:51:23,979 --> 06:52:03,159
Yeah, I got full health. I don't know if you can hear me. No, you can't I got you. Don't worry

1270
06:52:03,159 --> 06:52:41,360
I'll protect you. Okay, then go over here. Be careful. This is really dangerous a wizard like you. He's hallucinating again

1271
06:52:41,360 --> 06:52:56,490
This isn't even a multiplayer game. I don't understand what what Jeremy's talking about

1272
06:52:56,490 --> 06:52:59,610
He's been playing Scrabble on stream for the last six hours

1273
06:53:00,130 --> 06:53:03,849
Against the computer. I don't what is he talking about like swords and stuff

1274
06:53:03,889 --> 06:53:38,009
I'm just like taking everything and stuff sucks friendly. There's a boss down there. Can we kill it together?

1275
06:53:38,330 --> 06:53:46,229
Well, we're gonna have to figure that out. We're gonna have to go. We're gonna have to do it. I think it's mine

1276
06:53:46,229 --> 06:53:50,520
Holy shit. Oh my god

1277
06:53:52,119 --> 06:53:59,759
That's a fucking purple. That's a purple bro. I'm leaving. I'm out of here. I'm fucking out here. It's mine. It's all mine

1278
06:53:59,759 --> 06:54:09,750
Oh shit, we slept we separated. Is this cool? Wait, could he use that? Maybe I could give it to him

1279
06:54:09,869 --> 06:54:14,319
Hold on. Hold on a minute here. Hold on a second here. Hold on a minute. Hey, hold on a minute

1280
06:54:14,319 --> 06:54:18,200
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on. Everybody's relaxed. Everybody relaxed for a second. I'm freaking out

1281
06:54:18,200 --> 06:54:33,979
I can't jump that wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is who is it for?

1282
06:54:35,189 --> 06:54:39,639
Warden Ranger is do we have a Ranger anywhere over here?

1283
06:54:39,639 --> 06:54:55,159
I I actually would give it to the Ranger if there's a Ranger here give him the crystal ball

1284
06:54:55,159 --> 06:55:10,880
Oh, hey, can you use them? Should I do the Diablo 2 thing where you like dropped it on the ground?

1285
06:55:10,880 --> 06:55:13,159
I picked it up really quickly just to make piss everybody off

1286
06:55:16,119 --> 06:55:21,200
Please to do that and any time it got grabbed it was they would just leave the game. They were just an exit

1287
06:55:21,200 --> 06:55:24,159
I'm not gonna dump kidding

1288
06:55:24,159 --> 06:55:32,790
I would never do that but like if there really was a Ranger with us, I would absolutely give it to them

1289
06:55:33,310 --> 06:55:41,459
Because like that's fucking cool. I just too bad. It's not for a wizard. You probably should go over here

1290
06:55:41,459 --> 06:55:48,310
I used to do that in fucking tibia

1291
06:55:48,310 --> 06:55:54,259
Oh

1292
06:55:59,500 --> 06:56:04,619
See you later. See you later. See you later. Have fun everybody. Have fun. I got a fucking purple

1293
06:56:04,619 --> 06:56:07,889
I got a purple. I got a purple

1294
06:56:07,889 --> 06:56:29,549
I wish there was a Ranger in our like part of that little group because if you drop that for somebody that's actually using that

1295
06:56:29,549 --> 06:56:33,099
Class and they would just it was like holy shit

1296
06:56:33,099 --> 06:56:45,959
Did really like if somebody dropped me something for that could use quick end the stream

1297
06:56:46,000 --> 06:57:01,110
I will probably hold on to this because I will probably I'm not gonna I'll probably give this to somebody

1298
06:57:01,110 --> 06:57:04,330
Oh, by the way, let me like ask like an actual question here

1299
06:57:04,330 --> 06:57:07,950
Like I know I was just kind of fucking around was that like BM. I don't want to be like that guy

1300
06:57:07,950 --> 06:57:09,790
I know we're just kind of fucking around here

1301
06:57:09,790 --> 06:57:16,349
But is that like is that BM or anything like was I like a dick for doing that like be honest with me?

1302
06:57:16,349 --> 06:57:35,380
Cuz I don't I don't want to like, you know, yeah, who's it? Yeah, the wizard was the one who killed it

1303
06:57:35,380 --> 06:57:53,169
I just I just saw it die like I just saw fucking red and it was like a purple

1304
06:57:53,169 --> 06:58:18,340
I just picked it up and I freaked out leaving him stuck. There was meaner. It's true. Is there any way to do recent players? Oh

1305
06:58:21,049 --> 06:58:37,139
He feels bad. Well, I just I like don't know the etiquette and even if there is not I mean here's the thing

1306
06:58:37,139 --> 06:58:40,549
It is like it's just like a demo. So it's not like

1307
06:58:43,009 --> 06:58:55,819
But I don't be like a dick you would leave in a heartbeat if you if you were German

1308
06:58:56,459 --> 06:59:03,450
Is there actually like a recent players list cuz I will just send it to them. I really don't even care

1309
06:59:03,450 --> 06:59:08,500
I don't want to be like an asshole. It was like funny for a second and I'm like, wait a minute

1310
06:59:08,500 --> 06:59:13,830
That is actually really good and somebody could probably sell that but it is like five days left on the beta, right?

1311
06:59:13,909 --> 06:59:34,909
You're thinking too much about it. Yeah, I probably am it's a beta. There are no rules. That's true. That's true

1312
06:59:35,029 --> 07:00:01,369
Maybe if it was a legendary should I should you use the gathering halls be happy about it? Yeah

1313
07:00:02,049 --> 07:00:14,360
Trade what if I went into trade? I was like, hey the wizard that I just took that purple from did please DM me

1314
07:00:22,240 --> 07:00:31,459
The DM for BM he gave you the gloves you drop you have the odd that and 2020 hindsight

1315
07:00:31,459 --> 07:00:43,459
I should have just dropped that for him. I feel bad, but it's all good. Don't forget to stash it

1316
07:00:43,459 --> 07:00:54,979
Yeah, I got it right here. Dude. You gave him a magical globe. That's right. I did dude. Don't worry

1317
07:00:54,979 --> 07:01:02,790
What if he's a terrible guy in real life? That's not the point. That's not the point

1318
07:01:02,950 --> 07:01:14,439
He he probably thought the orb is what you got. Yeah, I should have just gave it to him. It's all good

1319
07:01:14,439 --> 07:01:54,180
All right, one more I'm gonna keep this. Where did I get this from? Oh

1320
07:01:55,450 --> 07:02:01,169
My god, this is for a wizard. Oh my god. How did I not see this?

1321
07:02:01,169 --> 07:02:08,349
I did I get that too. I gotta get in contact. I got I gotta fucking hit that guy up

1322
07:02:08,349 --> 07:02:13,950
I took all of his stuff. I gotta give him that fucking dagger. I have to I have to find that person

1323
07:02:14,709 --> 07:02:41,319
Fucking terrible. All right, let's I'm gonna play another one stash it for you

1324
07:02:49,479 --> 07:02:53,240
Screaming it's all mine and then I feel bad

1325
07:02:53,240 --> 07:03:00,500
I get my brain just like didn't piece together like what I was doing and I'm just like, oh, yeah

1326
07:03:00,740 --> 07:03:05,299
Wait. Oh, right. This is the people here. That's fucking

1327
07:03:06,419 --> 07:03:58,409
Well stash the shit. I did I did is anybody hold on. Where's the and I everybody remember their name

1328
07:03:58,689 --> 07:04:22,970
Nobody has to remember their name. Oh, you have stream remote on steam recent players. I don't have I'm not really maybe I can see

1329
07:04:28,680 --> 07:04:56,479
Recent game now one of the things up top wizards. There's only 18 wizards in the whole game name and karma

1330
07:04:56,479 --> 07:05:00,159
It'll show you oh that I knew it was somewhere

1331
07:05:00,240 --> 07:05:12,369
Oh, there was no there's no there was no teammates because we weren't technically in a team together

1332
07:05:12,369 --> 07:05:36,409
All right, let me sell this stuff and we'll we'll do one more. He's gone forever

1333
07:05:36,529 --> 07:06:06,360
How many more one more is a good question gotta be extra generous next time to make up for it

1334
07:06:06,360 --> 07:06:30,549
Yeah, I will atone for my sins. I will it's so funny cuz it's

1335
07:06:31,389 --> 07:06:37,990
Calling with the ring or something. I spent the last seven hours playing and like I've haven't been playing very well and all of a sudden

1336
07:06:37,990 --> 07:06:40,470
Like oh my god amazing. I don't take it

1337
07:06:41,900 --> 07:06:43,659
Yes, like it's right

1338
07:06:43,659 --> 07:07:31,919
Pretty good pretty good. You see your recent players. I just looked

1339
07:07:32,599 --> 07:07:51,099
There's nothing there. You were like a little raccoon. I know that's I got it felt like my god. I'm gonna die

1340
07:07:51,099 --> 07:08:37,919
Oh my god, I'm fucking sloppy right now dirty

1341
07:08:37,919 --> 07:08:49,950
I really do want to make it out because I have a lot of decent stuff. He said it's okay

1342
07:08:49,950 --> 07:09:04,729
It wasn't malicious. Yeah, but I still feel bad about it bugs

1343
07:09:07,439 --> 07:09:08,720
Yeah

1344
07:09:08,720 --> 07:09:35,520
Why is Bugs Bunny Peter Griffin the same character? Why is that they aren't it's just me

1345
07:09:35,520 --> 07:09:42,849
Yeah, my impression. Yeah, that's always scary every time it really is

1346
07:09:42,849 --> 07:09:58,729
All right, I'm just gonna move cuz kind of far away. I actually didn't his revenge. This is revenge for uh,

1347
07:10:00,540 --> 07:11:09,459
The Wizards revenge I was not altruistic enough. I can see names unless they're just scrambled nonsense. Are they he's addicted?

1348
07:11:09,459 --> 07:12:22,279
Yeah, I am somebody's behind that door. No

1349
07:12:23,419 --> 07:13:03,750
They were friends everything was going so well until you blinded by greed

1350
07:13:09,740 --> 07:13:13,439
Shit and he said hey, dude, does the stolen equipment work better? Oh

1351
07:13:18,909 --> 07:13:22,029
Okay, we laugh about this and it's like really not that big of a deal

1352
07:13:22,029 --> 07:13:28,450
I shit you not a couple hours from now. I'm gonna be lying in bed

1353
07:13:28,450 --> 07:13:33,299
You're talking to Holly and it's gonna be like I feel real bad about that wizard

1354
07:13:33,299 --> 07:13:51,770
I wonder if I can like reach out to him and give it back to him. Ow. Oh my god, don't even vote

1355
07:13:51,770 --> 07:13:54,569
It doesn't count. Don't even vote. It doesn't count. Don't even vote doesn't count

1356
07:13:54,569 --> 07:13:56,709
That's not that that one doesn't count up. Don't know that one doesn't count

1357
07:13:56,709 --> 07:14:07,200
There's been a few stinkers in a row it now that one doesn't count I walked out and I I was looking at chat

1358
07:14:07,319 --> 07:14:53,459
Well, you're gonna bet anyways, so this just pretend it's this one. All right

1359
07:14:53,459 --> 07:14:57,790
I had to pay I had to pay it forward over here. You shot me so I hit him

1360
07:14:57,790 --> 07:15:24,639
Hey, my buddy Eric just got his loot stolen by some jackass. Be careful. Damn shit

1361
07:15:24,639 --> 07:15:48,979
I'm gonna be on the lookout. I was waiting for you

1362
07:15:48,979 --> 07:15:52,400
I knew you were gonna do that and you still got me with it somehow

1363
07:15:52,560 --> 07:16:18,959
These are some really dog shit spawns the last two times, huh? I can die

1364
07:16:24,000 --> 07:16:26,360
That's pretty cool

1365
07:16:26,360 --> 07:17:41,569
Get this stink out of the way. You can't have any more in there. I can't believe this

1366
07:17:41,569 --> 07:18:08,189
I can't believe you still alive like I hit you a hundred times Jesus. Oh my god

1367
07:18:08,189 --> 07:18:42,520
I just want to leave but I can't walk up there. What is happening? What's happening? Let me help

1368
07:18:42,520 --> 07:19:56,779
I need that I need this and you're in the way. I got a plan. Come and get me now with it

1369
07:19:56,779 --> 07:20:23,680
Oh, you gotta be kidding me. You weren't even aiming at me. It's better than a player

1370
07:20:27,080 --> 07:20:43,639
What's this deal? Oh, I'm in trouble now. I'm dead. I just there's three people just fucking chasing my ass

1371
07:20:43,639 --> 07:21:27,200
Like you're doing great, sweetie

1372
07:21:27,759 --> 07:21:55,880
So here's the plan. I'm gonna do this one

1373
07:21:55,959 --> 07:22:08,819
I'm gonna do this one and then one more solo goblin world just for old times sake and that's it

1374
07:22:08,819 --> 07:22:14,950
And then I actually I have to go eat. I haven't eaten seven and a half hours. So I need to eat

1375
07:22:14,990 --> 07:22:52,880
I'm getting like brain fog. I'm just gonna I'm just gonna you know, I mean, I'm just gonna try to get away

1376
07:22:52,880 --> 07:23:09,049
I'm just gonna try to get out if they're red

1377
07:23:09,049 --> 07:23:21,229
Does that mean that they're stronger or have more health or something? Yes. Okay, that would explain the damage

1378
07:23:52,340 --> 07:24:07,259
How why am I not swinging to wait what what the fuck happened why oh you have to you have to hit right click

1379
07:24:07,259 --> 07:24:14,180
Then left click it's backwards. That's what the fuck. I come

1380
07:24:14,180 --> 07:24:18,950
I forgot just to do the swing to go one two with the swords

1381
07:24:18,950 --> 07:24:23,110
You have to do a right click then left click and not left click and right click you have to hit right click first

1382
07:24:23,229 --> 07:24:48,709
Now that was annoying that laugh. Yeah, so if you have if you have two swords, you can't press left click first

1383
07:24:48,709 --> 07:24:55,880
You'll just swing the left side. You can't do left and then right you have to hit right click first, which is come on

1384
07:24:55,880 --> 07:26:13,000
Gwen the heel. Okay, not bad. I have to get out of here though. Yeah, this is that this is truly the last one

1385
07:26:13,000 --> 07:26:27,569
Where the fuck are you? Oh

1386
07:26:27,689 --> 07:27:38,159
Just trying to get out of here without getting hit once. I actually have to get out of here now surprising that that did not kill

1387
07:27:47,639 --> 07:28:02,500
Jesus I got so complacent. I just was like, oh, I'm just like walking around just tacking random shit Jesus. No

1388
07:28:02,939 --> 07:28:11,459
No, no, no, no. Oh my goodness. What a disaster

1389
07:28:11,459 --> 07:28:18,840
Oh, come on, there's no getting out of that that one sucked

1390
07:28:18,840 --> 07:28:23,040
That one didn't count that one that truly was just stupid. That just didn't count

1391
07:28:23,040 --> 07:29:12,759
I escaped that shit turn around guy the bow and arrow. You just I'm just dead. I wouldn't count. I don't shit spawn. I

1392
07:29:15,419 --> 07:29:57,369
Just have to what is this a red bug what I can't move no matter what happens. This is it

1393
07:29:59,569 --> 07:30:07,490
Mmm, I could die in the first 10 seconds and that's it. I'll come back to it

1394
07:30:07,490 --> 07:30:33,119
Yeah, this is the final match no matter what happens next time. I will be in a party or maybe I'll play so I don't

1395
07:30:33,119 --> 07:30:35,919
I do but up you'll I'll be playing this again 100% this week

1396
07:30:35,919 --> 07:31:02,119
You bet your ass play it with stir play it with Vinnie. Yeah, I mean whoever wants to play out

1397
07:31:02,119 --> 07:31:14,049
I know it's probably a whole crew that can get cycled in and out. Okay final one. This is it

1398
07:31:14,049 --> 07:31:53,069
I'm gonna actually I'm gonna just quiet down. I'm gonna focus. I'm gonna try to win way too many nice

1399
07:31:53,229 --> 07:32:25,860
Very good. Very good. Very good. Hello. Let's work together. You have a pickaxe. Oh shit. You get a bow

1400
07:32:25,860 --> 07:33:11,750
Oh fuck every friend I get dies or I steal from them. That was my fault. What did I do?

1401
07:33:11,750 --> 07:33:19,060
I think he just gets shot in the head by an arrow. They're sad. It's unfortunate

1402
07:33:19,060 --> 07:33:20,299
I shouldn't be laughing at that

1403
07:33:20,299 --> 07:33:37,500
But I mean, I feel like I've discovered people's bodies a handful of times here. Okay, I gotta get out of here

1404
07:33:37,619 --> 07:33:43,860
I'm not this open-ass room. No way. See you

1405
07:34:47,659 --> 07:35:25,240
That's pretty good Eddie. Why is my name Eddie? Careful. Let's get him. Let's get him. I need to atone for my sins

1406
07:35:25,520 --> 07:35:45,919
Let's get him. Who's a week takes fighting together here or as I'm people just kind of walking

1407
07:35:46,759 --> 07:35:54,770
What? All right, somebody fall back or oh, please. I don't have any healing left

1408
07:35:54,930 --> 07:36:20,500
Why just people just walking around backstage? We're not fighting this anymore

1409
07:36:29,470 --> 07:36:33,150
It's so bad I wanted to do it so bad

1410
07:36:35,110 --> 07:36:37,540
No

1411
07:36:38,709 --> 07:36:45,750
Wait the shield I thought I blocked it. No. Oh, that's so annoying

1412
07:36:45,750 --> 07:36:53,590
I thought I fucking had it. I was certain I like a purple was gonna drop and I was gonna it was gonna be a whole

1413
07:36:53,590 --> 07:37:00,529
Thing I was gonna turn the voice on I'm gonna be like, hey take that you've earned this. Oh, I had a whole thing planned

1414
07:37:01,090 --> 07:37:16,180
Shoot why am I a loading screen?

1415
07:37:16,900 --> 07:38:13,279
Loading screen. What's happening? I can't just moving my spectating the heck swing man. What are you doing?

1416
07:38:13,279 --> 07:38:51,009

1417
07:38:51,009 --> 07:39:23,630
Actually, I think I'm gonna have to do this though. Okay, I'm in the center and chill out now

1418
07:39:23,869 --> 07:40:07,259
Just relax pick up some stuff and leave do not aggro more. That would be a huge mistake the red one. Oh

1419
07:40:34,150 --> 07:40:35,349
Oh

1420
07:40:35,349 --> 07:41:38,880

You have a bandage. It's okay. He's gone. Whatever

1425
07:42:25,400 --> 07:42:43,950
You Muppet that big chest. I am NOT gonna do that. I needed a lockpick moment of truth right here

1426
07:43:06,580 --> 07:43:09,700
How the fuck are you still alive? I have this

1433
07:44:48,419 --> 07:45:07,669
Jesus only you left one person

1434
07:45:14,439 --> 07:45:33,279
So what's the strategy here? Well, what was he? What was he waiting for? He's just afraid of the Archer probably. Yeah, nice

1435
07:45:33,520 --> 07:46:36,650
This is my sin corner. It's the guilt armor. All right, that was very very very fun

1436
07:46:36,650 --> 07:48:26,419
Oh, it's offhand. This is the comedy run. This one is not even real. There's no betting or anything

1437
07:48:26,419 --> 07:48:51,400
It's nothing about it's just a comedy run. See it's already funny. They're already really funny

1438
07:48:51,400 --> 07:49:20,180
This is such a bad spawn to new law. No, there's no way. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow

1439
07:49:20,299 --> 07:49:27,569

1440
07:49:27,569 --> 07:49:38,590
So Thursday because it is technically no no no no no Wednesday because it is technically Tuesday right now

1441
07:49:38,590 --> 07:49:52,080
So I'll see you Wednesday. We're gonna play more of this. I want to play more dark and darker

1442
07:49:52,080 --> 07:50:01,360
There's only six days in this test and then they just wipe everything and they put it back in the oven for like another two

1443
07:50:01,360 --> 07:50:06,220
Or three months. Yeah, I'll see you guys on

1444
07:50:06,580 --> 07:50:09,599
See you guys on

1445
07:50:09,599 --> 07:50:26,040
Wednesday the eighth have an awesome rest of your night. Take care of yourselves. Get some sleep. See you later

1446
07:50:26,040 --> 07:50:28,740
Okay

1447
07:50:28,740 --> 07:50:53,409
Now that they all left everyone that wanted to go to bed that really needed to go to bed was like, all right

1448
07:50:53,409 --> 07:51:24,049
I'm going to bed. See that person's doing a comedy run. I can't do one more. It seems good. All right, it's confession time

1449
07:51:28,680 --> 07:51:30,680
What a terrible place for that to spot

1450
07:51:31,080 --> 07:51:36,259
No, get get me out of here. Let me out. Let me out. He's a rabid fucking animal

1451
07:51:36,819 --> 07:52:04,580
Like pretty good comedy run I would say peak comedy run

1452
07:52:04,900 --> 07:52:17,990
What was the confession in the first 30 minutes of playing this game? I thought it was fucking dog shit

1453
07:52:18,689 --> 07:52:32,159
Like in the first 30 minutes. I was like, wow, this game is fucking absolute dog shit. So this is awful

1454
07:52:32,220 --> 07:52:33,659
well

1455
07:52:33,659 --> 07:52:38,610
I'll play this for like an hour or two and then I'm fucking never opening this again and then um

1456
07:52:38,849 --> 07:52:43,619
And then I realized what what it was and and realized that it was fun

1457
07:52:44,619 --> 07:52:48,700
Now I am telling you this is probably going to be my favorite game of the year

1458
07:52:53,099 --> 07:52:55,900
This possibly could be one of my favorite games for the year

1459
07:53:03,509 --> 07:53:06,069
It's just it just grabs a hold of you

1460
07:53:15,740 --> 07:53:22,860
Yeah, I mean that's obviously a really bold prediction, but I I know how I am when I get in a game

1461
07:53:23,419 --> 07:53:30,810
And this is really fun. Even if it's like kind of a it's it's it's kind of it's rough, right?

1462
07:53:30,970 --> 07:53:37,240
But rough in a kind of a good way

1463
07:53:37,240 --> 07:53:42,330
Um, I know it's it's literally february and this game's not even out yet

1464
07:53:42,729 --> 07:53:54,540
But I could see myself jumping in this and just playing it and bashing my head against the wall. Oh shit. Sorry

1465
07:53:55,159 --> 07:54:12,569
Yeah, I lowered this accidentally. Thanks for watching. Thanks for staying up. Um, we'll play this again

1466
07:54:12,650 --> 07:54:17,209
I'll see you probably i'll ping some other streamers and see who wants to play it. Maybe on um on wednesday

1467
07:54:23,400 --> 07:54:37,830
Have an amazing rest of your night. Get some sleep. See you soon. Thanks for watching. Take care of yourselves

1468
07:54:39,860 --> 07:54:44,180
See you soon. Good night guys call your mother call your mother

1469
07:54:45,220 --> 07:54:49,049
