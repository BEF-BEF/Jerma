1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:05,110
Somebody said, I was waiting for you to cancel the stream because you suck.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:16,820
Why would you wait here for me to cancel the stream?

3
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,600
Okay, hold on. How long has it been?

4
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,280
It's been 45 minutes now. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Where is he?

5
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,480
He cancelled. All right. Nice. Now I can go back to my life.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:37,880
Oh, he's like, he's kind of late today.

7
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,320
Wow. It's been like two hours.

8
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,049
Fuck.

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,500
Anyways, um, wait, we got like, there's too much music going on right now.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,619
I just spoiled it for you.

11
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,590
We've got a cozy stream ahead. Yeah.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,019
Yeah, I feel like we've been, um, we've been hitting the gas for the last couple of weeks.

13
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:13,400
It might be time if just for, just for like the next couple of days to sit back and relax and play

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,420
one of these old fucking games.

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,049
It's probably going to be a very, very cozy stream.

16
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,959
Whoops. I don't want to relax.

17
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:35,959
Zoo. This is Zoo Tycoon 2. All the animals edition.

18
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,359
This is the ultimate edition. It has everything, every expansion.

19
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,069
I got to learn how to play. This is going to be, we're going to be like in the tutorial for like

20
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,629
30 minutes because I want to know what I'm doing.

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:59,099
Do you ever wish it was just a little bit colder?

22
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,109
Nah, I like the temperature the way it is.

23
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:07,269
But so let's, let's, let's break down the next week here.

24
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:14,659
Okay. So we've got Zoo, Zoo, Zoo Calamity 2, whatever the hell it's called.

25
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,439
Zoo Tycoon 2 for today.

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:29,060
And then if Red Dead Online works tomorrow, then I'm going to play that.

27
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,939
Or I don't know, maybe, maybe I won't.

28
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,620
Maybe I'll keep playing Zoo Tycoon 2.

29
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,699
Maybe I'll just bury my Twitch channel into the ground and play Zoo Tycoon 2 for the next like four weeks.

30
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:47,990
But then obviously, so we're going to go, we're going to go today, tomorrow.

31
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:52,310
And then I'm going to take, so that'd be Tuesday, Wednesday.

32
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,430
I'm going to take Thursday off.

33
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:58,310
And then I'm going to get, make sure I'm prepared Friday and Saturday.

34
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:05,060
Saturday is by the way, the green screen movie night is on Sunday.

35
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,939
So as of Thursday, the 29th here, you've got to get a submission.

36
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:15,300
And if you have a submission, make sure you read those rules.

37
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,340
It's pinned in that discord.

38
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,099
You only got another couple of days here.

39
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:24,810
So we got every weekend, we've had something fun to do.

40
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:26,330
That's what I want to do, man.

41
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,250
I want to make every fucking weekend.

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,370
I want to do something interesting.

43
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,419
Free shit.

44
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,539
We got free shit coming in.

45
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,039
What do you mean?

46
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,159
What do you mean free shit?

47
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,960
Where's the free shit?

48
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:50,379
I missed the context.

49
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,629
It was somebody just trolling.

50
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,629
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

51
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,990
I thought like, I thought I was in the middle of a giveaway.

52
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,710
I'm like, really?

53
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,590
What are they giving away?

54
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,750
Can I get something?

55
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,830
What do we, how do I join?

56
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:13,960
I want a fucking new five button mouse.

57
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,600
All right.

58
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,529
Don't get a five button mouse, by the way.

59
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,810
Just not comfortable.

60
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,329
Two is all you need.

61
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,689
Two and then the third button on top.

62
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:23,930
All right.

63
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,569
Let's play Zooka.

64
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,209
I can't say this fucking word.

65
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,589
The C.

66
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:30,870
The tycoon.

67
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,370
Zooka.

68
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:39,529
It's like somebody just snips a portion of my brain

69
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,410
that makes it so I can't say zoo tycoon.

70
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,850
Zoo tycoon.

71
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:45,370
Zoo tycoon.

72
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,180
That sounds wrong.

73
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,379
Is that correct?

74
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,720
Am I saying that word right?

75
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,939
Zoo tycoon.

76
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,500
I'm losing my mind.

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:00,740
All right.

78
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,139
Let's go.

79
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,189
Thanks for joining us.

80
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:07,050
Get this off.

81
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,850
And hey, look at that.

82
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:11,620
Here's zoo tycoon.

83
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,990
Why can't they just make it tycoon of zoo?

84
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,730
You got hit on the head too many times during the green screen.

85
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,779
Listen to that music.

86
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,699
This is old school.

87
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,350
You have to spin the world around.

88
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,350
I'm all right.

89
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:37,389
Whoa!

90
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,160
Does anybody think that was funny?

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,100
Did anybody else feel that?

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,839
All right.

93
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,120
Let's learn how to control the game.

94
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:51,860
All right.

95
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,699
That's the kind of joke you make with your son.

96
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,259
Hey, here we are.

97
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,939
Here we are, Daniel.

98
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:00,660
And watch that.

99
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,939
Whoa!

100
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,300
I can feel the earth moving underneath my legs, Daniel.

101
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:08,660
And Daniel's probably two or three years old

102
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,699
and thinks it's really happening.

103
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:11,259
What?

104
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,379
But dad, what happened?

105
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,779
And dad's like, I'm just kidding, Daniel.

106
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:27,269
Go to bed so dad can play zoo tycoon.

107
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:27,910
Gamer dad.

108
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,860
Fuck you, dad.

109
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,819
I want to play Fortnite.

110
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,339
Get out of here with that Fortnite shit.

111
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,379
Zoo tycoon.

112
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:44,500
I have 6100 hours in zoo tycoon 2, Daniel.

113
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,240
How many hours do you have in Fortnite?

114
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,269
Oh, what's that, Daniel?

115
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:52,870
Oh, only like 40 hours

116
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,620
because I only allow you to use the computer an hour a day.

117
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,339
Get out of here.

118
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,639
Dad's got work to do.

119
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:09,769
All right.

120
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,250
Learning how to control the video game.

121
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,610
Welcome to zoo tycoon.

122
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,689
I fucking can't say it.

123
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:19,689
Guys, you understand.

124
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,810
We're not even getting past the title of the game.

125
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,329
That's how this stream is starting.

126
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:29,420
I can't even get past the title.

127
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,420
In the following tutorials, you'll learn the basics

128
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,339
of how to control the camera.

129
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,740
Then you'll move on to construction techniques

130
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,100
and accessing all the information

131
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,139
available to you about your zoo.

132
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,180
Let's get started.

133
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,500
Okay.

134
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:41,259
All right.

135
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,300
So it's click move, open the goal panel

136
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,819
by clicking on the scenario goals button.

137
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,040
So here's scenario goals.

138
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,959
Click display information about the current goals

139
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,519
and challenges.

140
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,800
So that's the challenge button.

141
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,839
Your scenario challenge goals will fill here

142
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,519
when you play a campaign or challenge game.

143
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,360
Normally this panel will update whenever you succeed

144
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,879
or fail to complete a goal.

145
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,399
The tutorials are a little different though.

146
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,139
So for now, this is the only thing that's going to be here.

147
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:06,779
Cheese goal.

148
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:07,420
Okay.

149
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,379
Close the goal panel.

150
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:16,939
Great.

151
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:18,459
Return to the goal panel anytime you see

152
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,699
what your current goals are.

153
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,420
Easy enough.

154
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,490
Now we can learn how to move the camera around the game.

155
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,339
We'll check the button.

156
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,699
I told you this is chill.

157
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,220
This is going to be a chill stream.

158
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,980
I'm going to learn how to take care of the animals.

159
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,750
See, this is me right there.

160
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,299
Now we need to practice moving the camera around.

161
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,490
Scroll the map by using the arrow keys or WASD.

162
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,629
That's more comfortable.

163
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:43,860
Uh-huh.

164
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,460
And this is zoom in and zoom out.

165
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,340
You can do zoom in and it's the mouse wheel.

166
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,879
Got it.

167
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:54,470
Rotate the camera by pressing on the primary game button panel

168
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,309
or click and hold the left mouse while you move.

169
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:57,879
Look at that.

170
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,360
Okay.

171
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,399
That's that easy.

172
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,120
Guest mode.

173
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,399
Enter zoo guest mode by clicking on the zoo guest mode button.

174
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,620
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

175
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,899
This thing made me so much more excited.

176
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:16,820
In zoo guest mode, you can walk around your zoo

177
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
by pressing the left mouse button.

178
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,419
Normally when you enter zoo guest mode,

179
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,129
the mouse cursor is hidden so that your view is unobstructed.

180
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,009
To toggle your mouse cursor on and off or to view

181
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:35,620
or to switch to photo safari view, right click the mouse.

182
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,309
This turns into a first person game.

183
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,389
Oh man, this is going to be fun.

184
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,259
You can also take on the duties of a maintenance worker

185
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:45,740
to sweep trash and empty trash cans.

186
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,220
When you approach something that you can interact with,

187
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,659
it'll automatically be selected.

188
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:51,590
Just hit space bar to perform the action.

189
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,629
Now it's your turn.

190
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,110
Press the left mouse button or use the moving keys

191
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,789
to walk up to a piece of trash.

192
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:05,259
Is that person stuck in there?

193
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:08,460
Holy shit, that person almost died.

194
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,450
That was like almost a vicious camel attack.

195
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,659
All right.

196
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,590
Pick it.

197
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,830
Great.

198
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,190
You can also perform zookeeper dirties.

199
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,730
You can also do dirty zookeeper things.

200
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,250
You can feed and water animals,

201
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,960
groom them, heal them, rake poop.

202
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,519
Okay.

203
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,379
We're going to be here for a while.

204
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,100
Same way.

205
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,379
Heal them and of course rake.

206
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,299
Doing these things yourself could mean

207
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:42,940
that you don't need to pay a staff member to do it.

208
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,259
Very helpful for a financially struggling zoo,

209
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:46,870
but I can do it all myself.

210
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,379
I'm not going to have any staff.

211
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,250
I always get so fucking destroyed in these games

212
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,659
because I hire too many people.

213
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,700
You got five janitors, four maintenance guys,

214
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,740
six zookeepers.

215
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,460
No, no, no, no, no.

216
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,139
I'm just going to walk around

217
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,899
and if something needs to be done, I'm going to do it myself.

218
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,019
I can walk around with a portable hose.

219
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:09,299
That's all you need is a hose.

220
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:12,549
Don't understand?

221
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:13,590
Every single thing,

222
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,590
every single job you could possibly think of

223
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,590
in the world just requires a hose.

224
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,289
Just spray it.

225
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:22,149
Ah, there's like dirt all over my deck.

226
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,190
Fucking spray it with a hose.

227
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,690
It's done.

228
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,970
Oh, I, my car.

229
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,610
I need to get a car.

230
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,129
Why don't you spray it with a fucking hose, dude?

231
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:31,769
Don't worry about it.

232
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:32,169
It's easy.

233
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,399
Oh, my taxes aren't done on time.

234
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,000
Just spray your taxes with the hose.

235
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,639
Time check of photo safari mode.

236
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,000
Click on the photo safari view button.

237
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,320
Okay.

238
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,600
So here's the photo mode.

239
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,799
You can take pictures and shit.

240
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:54,700
This is just going to be Hey You Pikachu, right?

241
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,580
What's the game that just came out?

242
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,179
Let's Go Pikachu, right?

243
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:08,250
In this photo, so you can zoom your camera in,

244
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,129
take photographs of everything.

245
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,730
You just press spacebar to take a picture.

246
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,990
Okay.

247
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,940
Let's return.

248
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,980
So I want to move this.

249
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:23,019
That's a pretty cool photo.

250
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:23,659
Hold on.

251
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:29,750
This is such a spy cam.

252
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,500
I got it.

253
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,250
Just hose the trash.

254
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,889
It's fine.

255
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:41,960
All right.

256
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,080
Click the overhead button.

257
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,340
It's this one right here.

258
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,500
That's the big circle is the overhead mode.

259
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,870
You need the overview map by clicking on the overview.

260
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,470
This one, click to switch the overview,

261
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,389
which allows you to jump directly to any exhibit

262
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:53,830
or specific zoo area.

263
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,330
Okay.

264
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:58,100
The overview map gives you a broad layout of your zoo.

265
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,340
You can quickly jump around from place to place in your zoo.

266
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,600
Okay.

267
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,679
So there's a crocodile exhibit.

268
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,480
Oops, a daisy.

269
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,299
Press F1 to open the zoopedia.

270
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,049
This is fucking a ton of information.

271
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,679
That information about game controls, animals in the zoo.

272
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,080
Press F1 to open zoopedia and some panels.

273
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,639
You can click on some shit and learn some stuff.

274
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,139
Okay.

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,559
F1 is...

276
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,179
All right.

277
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:24,149
We did it.

278
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:24,870
I know how to play.

279
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:28,009
Never mind.

280
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:29,419
Click the next...

281
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:29,659
Yeah.

282
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:30,299
Let's just go.

283
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:31,419
Let's bang them all up.

284
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:31,899
What time...

285
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:32,460
What'd that take?

286
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,299
Seven minutes?

287
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,350
The following, you will learn the basics of construction,

288
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,190
how to make a basic exhibit, change terrain.

289
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,710
You don't start, buddy.

291
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,110
Let's go.

292
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,409
Select the recycle objects and buildings button.

293
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,889
So this is this one.

294
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:57,769
All right.

295
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:58,250
Somebody...

296
00:13:58,889 --> 00:13:59,850
Somebody correct me here.

297
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,850
I need to be corrected if I'm wrong.

298
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,860
This is like the Windows 3.1 panel, isn't it?

299
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,659
Like the Windows...

300
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:07,860
This is an old Windows panel.

301
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:09,620
That used to exist.

302
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,740
This is my computer.

303
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,299
This is the undo button.

304
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,799
Yes, it is.

305
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,000
Like this used to be there.

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,519
This is the panel for Windows 3.1.

307
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,059
He's a boomer.

308
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,279
40-year-old streamer.

309
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,279
Getting real fucking close.

310
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,360
Sooner or later, I have to stop saying the F word.

311
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,429
After 40, you can't say the F word anymore.

312
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,899
What 40-year-old do you know that says the F word?

313
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,019
I don't know very many.

314
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,059
They're like,

315
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:40,379
Oh, hi.

316
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,100
Yes, how are you?

317
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,299
I'm a 40-year-old guy.

318
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:42,700
They're not like,

319
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,220
Hey, what's up, you fucking dude?

320
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,100
I gotta stop doing that.

321
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:52,500
All right.

322
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,259
Remove unwanted objects from your zoo.

323
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:55,990
Click the button.

324
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,669
Look for the solitary tree inside a rectangular area enclosed by a path.

325
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:04,440
It's marked with an X painted in the dirt.

326
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,059
The baobab tree is right in the center of this area.

327
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,059
Move your cursor over the baobab tree and click to recycle it.

328
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,539
Okay.

329
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,830
We're looking for an X.

330
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,789
We're looking for...

331
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:17,750
I don't, please.

332
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,029
I'm fucking kidding.

333
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:19,820
Good job.

334
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,419
You received cash for recycled objects,

335
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:24,120
but it will only be a portion of its full purchase price.

336
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,350
Note that you can't recycle animals.

337
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,549
That just wouldn't be right.

338
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,409
Click the check button on this panel to continue.

339
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:32,649
Yeah.

340
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:38,009
I mean, it's kind of can't...

341
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,960
Is like eating animals, recycling them?

342
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,240
Think about that for a second.

343
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,769
That is essentially like recycling.

344
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:58,379
You consume, you don't waste, reusing.

345
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:08,389
And then you plant the bones and then a tree grows out of the bone.

346
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:12,940
And that's how, where animals come from.

347
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,740
A cow tree.

348
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:17,500
All right.

349
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,460
Well, I wish we weren't really...

350
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,980
We wouldn't have wanted that tree.

351
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,860
We can get it back though.

352
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,330
Click on the undo button right now.

353
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,690
I wonder how far, how many times you can do that.

354
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,460
That dinosaur pee was recycled over the next few thousand years

355
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,500
to become your coffee.

356
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:36,980
That's fine.

357
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,590
I don't care.

358
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:46,919
You could tell me that coffee was like rat shit mixed in water

359
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,220
and I'd still drink it.

360
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,940
I would.

361
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,220
How would that change anything?

362
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,100
Right?

363
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,580
Oh my God.

364
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,179
No, there's no, I would not eat that.

365
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:53,659
I wouldn't drink.

366
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:54,139
Yes, you would.

367
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:54,620
What changed?

368
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,179
How does that change?

369
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,090
Coffee is actually, it's burnt cigarette ashes

370
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,850
and rat shit mixed in water.

371
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,730
There's a huge study that just a big whistleblower came out.

372
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,849
I'd be like, I don't care.

373
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,940
All right, undo.

374
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,980
You can use undo to reverse the last thing you did.

375
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,779
This is very handy.

376
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,019
Yeah, I know.

377
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:18,420
Wait.

378
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,390
Note that you can only undo the last thing you did.

379
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,250
So you can't just control Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z.

380
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,710
You can only do one thing.

381
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,210
Video games weren't that advanced yet.

382
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,650
So you can't only go back one time.

383
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,329
Which, I mean, this is one of the greatest games ever made.

384
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,289
So who cares?

385
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,490
All right, let's build a building.

386
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,980
The construction panel is where you'll want to place fences, paths,

387
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,180
zoo building scenarios.

388
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,579
I'm sorry.

389
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:46,779
You know what keeps happening?

390
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,390
Is my fucking cigarette ash rat shit is,

391
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,230
there's a little bit on the bottom that I didn't wipe up

392
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,269
and I have it on a coaster.

393
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:57,529
And every time I pick up the glass,

394
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,009
the coaster sticks to the bottom of the coffee

395
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:02,490
and then falls off after I pick it up for a second.

396
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,009
There's nothing I can do about it.

397
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:09,960
All right, fences, paths, zoos, you know,

398
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,480
all kinds of the manmade objects in the zoo.

399
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,279
Click the check button.

400
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,569
Let's go.

401
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,569
Fence is the most common way to keep your animals in

402
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:20,660
and your guests out.

403
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,970
Click on the rectangle fence.

404
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,130
So this is the rectangle fence placement.

405
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,170
This is free form.

406
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,410
I gotta like pay attention.

407
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,369
I am, I am.

408
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,380
Easily create an enclosed habitat.

409
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,819
So find the rectangle area enclosed by a path.

410
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,619
It's the same area where you just replaced the bob tree.

411
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,299
Let's create a fenced area.

412
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,019
Select the chain link fence

413
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:49,319
and they click on the ground to anchor the corner.

414
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,000
So I want to do it like here.

415
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,880
All right, but here's that.

416
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,720
Do I want it on the Mario Kart track

417
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
or do I want it off the Mario Kart track?

418
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,569
Off the Mario Kart track, right?

419
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:05,930
On the Mario Kart track.

420
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,059
No, but how is Luigi gonna get in first place?

421
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:17,819
Anchor the corner.

422
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:18,380
It's just right here.

423
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,019
It's fine, whatever.

424
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,700
Will your mouse see a preview of the enclosure

425
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,740
and click again to place the fence?

426
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:29,460
Make a fenced area as large as the rectangle.

427
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,180
Great.

428
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,900
Basic enclosure.

429
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,380
Later, you can try the octagonal placement mode

430
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,099
to make an octagonal shape with the rubber band mode

431
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,299
to place single sections.

432
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,980
Click the check button to continue.

433
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,380
Now it's time to place a gate.

434
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,099
This is where this is just the key line staff gate.

435
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,470
I guess it could really just go like right here.

436
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,690
Place it over the fenced area you just made.

437
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,130
The gate preview will snap into place.

438
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,009
How about right there?

439
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,359
You want to make sure that your enclosed areas

440
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,480
have gates that your staff can get in

441
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,680
and take care of the animals.

442
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,359
Right now we're only using the chain link fence.

443
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,119
But there are all kinds of different fences.

444
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,960
The staff gate will automatically work on any of them.

445
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,349
Just get out.

446
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:08,250
Get out.

447
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,890
Whatever.

448
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,079
All right, here's the scenery tab.

449
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,119
So this is the fence tab.

450
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,400
That's where you keep animals in.

451
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Here's the scenery tab.

452
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:24,140
Somebody just said chain link.

453
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,190
No, we don't talk about cryptocurrency anymore

454
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,670
on this channel.

455
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,220
We don't discuss crypto assets anymore, okay?

456
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:42,759
It's all right.

457
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,970
Everything's fine.

458
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,970
That's how you know he lost big.

459
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,170
I didn't lose anything.

460
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,069
Up here, upstairs, inside of the skull,

461
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,269
there's a device up there.

462
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:01,880
There's a thing up there that has so much, so much in it.

463
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,109
And I, let me tell you, I got fucking coaster.

464
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:07,349
I'm, I got out, all right?

465
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,269
I left some in, I got out.

466
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,160
I was interested, not invested.

467
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,980
Let's make that very clear.

468
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,980
I have to put this, I'm changing coaster.

469
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:26,940
All right, I have a different coaster now.

470
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,299
Mom says it's my turn.

471
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,259
No, it's not.

472
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:31,539
All right, nobody'd see many objects

473
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:32,660
on the scenery by panel.

474
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,019
But for now, we've narrowed it down

475
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,779
to just one, the donation box.

476
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:38,740
Click the, all right, the donation box.

477
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,799
Okay, okay, I can get by on this one.

478
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:44,220
You have a donation box selected.

479
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,299
Move your mouse over the world to see a preview.

480
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,789
Okay, you can rotate it with the keys of those.

481
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,859
Okay, that's weird.

482
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:57,720
Oh shit, you should place donation boxes

483
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,940
near every single stream.

484
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,740
If viewers can't find a donation box,

485
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,900
make sure to put an overlay on your stream,

486
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,980
telling them exactly where to go,

487
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,660
and maybe even in your title as well.

488
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,500
So then they are absolutely certain

489
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,799
of the correct way to give you

490
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,579
any amount of money during the whole stream,

491
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:26,119
is what I, I'm sorry, that's all I saw.

492
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,539
All right, it's often a good idea

493
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:29,740
to place multiple donation boxes

494
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,859
so that guests won't be inconvenienced in any way.

495
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,309
So if guests can't find a donation,

496
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:38,549
the cash will stay in their pockets.

497
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:40,579
So this is how you make money.

498
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay, pathing tab.

499
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
You'll see that there are a number

500
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,460
of different paths that you can choose from.

501
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,380
Guests don't so much care

502
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,940
what type of path surfaces in your zoo,

503
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,700
but they do care that there is one.

504
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,940
Click check button on this panel.

505
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,140
Paths work like fences do.

506
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,460
Click on the ground to anchor the path,

507
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,259
then move the mouse.

508
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:10,539
Yeah, yeah, so this is a standard asphalt path.

509
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,900
Now I'm not going to do it.

510
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,500
I don't know why I thought that would be funny.

511
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,859
Yeah, I'm just going to say it,

512
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:19,220
like, and then delete it, okay?

513
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,500
You know, I had diarrhea last night.

514
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,019
Yeah, well, it was my leg's fault.

515
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:24,900
It was my ass fault.

516
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:36,200
And now you can delete it

517
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,720
because there's no context,

518
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,440
it makes no sense.

519
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,519
Then move the mouse to see a preview of the path.

520
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,519
What does that have to do with like concrete though?

521
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,130
Somebody make that joke funny,

522
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,049
like change it to like I had diarrhea

523
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:52,250
on the ground or something.

524
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,960
Like I, or like I fell down on the ground

525
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,240
and I landed on my bum.

526
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
And so it wasn't, somebody will figure it out.

527
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,680
And then I want a 10% commission.

528
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,309
I don't know what's wrong with me tonight.

529
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:11,930
Then move the mouse to see a preview.

530
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah, click and place it.

531
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,599
Notice that the path on the map is very narrow

532
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,880
around the rectangular exhibit area.

533
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,839
Place some new path to make it wider for your guests.

534
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,740
Wait, it wants me to like do this, okay.

535
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,579
You want to make sure that your path

536
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,259
lead to your exhibits.

537
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:30,180
Guests stand on paths to view exhibits.

538
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,900
They stand around.

539
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,059
So if your paths are far too away,

540
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,579
your guests won't see your exhibits.

541
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:36,660
You'll miss out on your great animals

542
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,440
and you'll miss out on their donations.

543
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,799
Yep, you'll want those paths

544
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,559
leading to your donation boxes too.

545
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,329
Click the check button on this panel to continue.

546
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,839
Why do I keep reading that of all the things?

547
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,799
All right, here's the building.

548
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,279
So this is the fence tab, path tab, building tab.

549
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,369
There's all kinds of buildings.

550
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,809
Jerma, calm down.

551
00:24:58,809 --> 00:24:59,529
I'm all right.

552
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:04,150
Okay, from food and drinks stands to restrooms and more.

553
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:07,660
I purchased a hot dog food stand,

554
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,819
a pretzel cart and a soda drink stand.

555
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:13,109
You already have the hot dog stand.

556
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:15,269
Move your mouse over the zoo to see a preview.

557
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:16,309
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:18,859
Notice the green access arrow which shows

559
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,500
side that guests will approach.

560
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,779
Okay, so this is the side that they approach.

561
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,380
Go ahead and place one of each building now.

562
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,539
So we want to have that be completely accessible.

563
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:29,779
So one right here.

564
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,640
Let's get one right here.

565
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,319
This is just the tutorial.

566
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,640
That'll be a fucking brilliant design.

567
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,430
Don't worry.

568
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,829
Guests get hungry, thirsty and need to use the bathroom

569
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:44,869
while visiting your zoo.

570
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,470
If you don't, the asphalt.

571
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,029
If you don't provide them with amenities to meet these needs,

572
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,829
they may leave prematurely and take their cash with them.

573
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:56,680
Like exhibits and donation boxes.

574
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,599
Hold on, someone's gonna steal the donation box?

575
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,500
Make sure the guests are happy.

576
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,259
Otherwise they'll sprint out of the park with,

577
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:17,339
it's stuck on the bottom of that one too.

578
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:18,380
I don't know why that's happening.

579
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,569
They may sprint out of your store

580
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,730
with the donation box laughing the whole time.

581
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,329
Make sure that you have pass

582
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:27,930
leading to all your great amenities.

583
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:34,650
Click on the pretzel cart you just placed in your zoo.

584
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,460
Pretzel cart guy for the next one on bullets.

585
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,420
Where'd I go?

586
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,619
Great, you have the pretzel cart selected.

587
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,140
Note that an information panel opens up

588
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,799
showing the item you have selected.

589
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,640
Don't worry about all the things on this panel for now.

590
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,539
We'll come back to this later.

591
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:56,980
So you can pick up a building.

592
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,849
This is to move it if you want to change where it is.

593
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,220
Click the object.

594
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,940
Yeah, that's fine.

595
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,779
So we just go like this if we want to move it.

596
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,140
Yep, yep, yep.

597
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,539
Clicking and holding the left mouse button.

598
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,829
Okay, that makes it easier.

599
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:23,220
Let me test that out.

600
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,900
Okay, yeah, so that's how you do it.

601
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,759
You can just move the mouse around.

602
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,720
All right, adopting animals.

603
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,519
Click on the animals button

604
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,039
to open the animal adoption tab.

605
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,519
This is where you'll obtain animals for your zoo.

606
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,799
Great, now let's adopt an animal.

607
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,480
Click on the button to continue.

608
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,069
Okay, so you can do male or female.

609
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,180
You'll see that you already have the African elephant

610
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,619
selected on the adoption panel.

611
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:48,619
Move your mouse cursor over to the fenced area

612
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:51,750
that you made earlier and place the African elephant

613
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,490
inside of the other enclosure and cause a huge problem

614
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:04,440
because an elephant and a camel are gonna fight.

615
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,720
Excellent, now you have a new animal.

616
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,599
Guests come to see animals.

617
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,079
So if you have no animals, you'll have no guests.

618
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,359
Let them fight.

619
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,480
No, we didn't look.

620
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,799
Those of you that might be new to the stream,

621
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,400
or those of you that are old to the stream,

622
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,740
you gotta give me like at least an hour or two

623
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,890
to play the game because once it goes off the rails

624
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,259
and I start putting like birds inside

625
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:27,299
of the elephant enclosure

626
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,059
and the elephants start picking birds out of the air

627
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:30,099
and eating them with their trunks.

628
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,740
I'm never gonna go back and play the game ever again

629
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,940
the way it's meant to be played.

630
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:38,980
So it's already off the rails.

631
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,819
I'm just in the tutorial.

632
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,690
What do you mean it's off the rails?

633
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,130
I'm in the tutorial.

634
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,869
I made an asphalt joke and it was very bad

635
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:50,230
and I was corrected.

636
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,779
I'm willing to admit when I'm incorrect

637
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,069
and wrong about something.

638
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,430
I was not correct.

639
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:05,720
Check ass.

640
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,920
All animals require food and water

641
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,759
but they won't eat just anything, will you?

642
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,480
That's true.

643
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,630
Okay, how to determine what an animal eats later.

644
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,029
All right.

645
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:18,200
So we got hay or we got water.

646
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,299
I'm assuming we need both.

647
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,660
Purchase food and water.

648
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,130
Place a food trough with hay and food

649
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,880
through with water near the elephant

650
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,920
by clicking on the dish

651
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,599
and then clicking inside of the enclosure.

652
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,180
So it can just kind of be anywhere, right?

653
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,230
We'll do two of these and then two of these.

654
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,589
Oh, one of those actually.

655
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:38,069
That's fine.

656
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:40,890
Select the animal shelters tab

657
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,890
to open up the animal shelter panel.

658
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,740
So here is while an exhausted animal might...

659
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,539
What is he doing?

660
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:47,579
He's spraying it with like poison.

661
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:47,819
What are you?

662
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,259
Oh, no, it's a hose.

663
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,779
See, portable hose.

664
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:58,490
Portable hose.

665
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,890
While an exhausted animal might just sleep anywhere.

666
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,289
Most animals require a shelter.

667
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:04,970
So this is the elephant shelter.

668
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,960
Certain advanced objects need to be studied

669
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,180
more carefully before you have access to them.

670
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,579
You do this by choosing to research the object.

671
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:13,779
Objects that need to be researched

672
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,680
have a small beaker appearing over their icon.

673
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,660
Press the research button on the object.

674
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,859
Info panel will begin research on it.

675
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,660
I don't have it yet.

676
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,859
So let's go ahead and research it.

677
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:26,180
It costs a thousand bucks to research time and money.

678
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,460
Once the research has been completed,

679
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,740
the object is available for purchase.

680
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,259
Click the check button.

681
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:31,140
Stop reading that.

682
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,529
Why is that even there?

683
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:35,450
Wait for it to be done.

684
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,690
Wait for your units to be ready and your RTS.

685
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,049
Okay, now you can place it.

686
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:42,680
All right, you can do other things

687
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,880
while the objects are being researched.

688
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,970
This would be a great time to take a look around the zoo.

689
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,130
Okay, it's done.

690
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,009
So I need to be...

691
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:53,130
Let's put it like...

692
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:59,369
Put it like in the corner right here.

693
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:05,079
All right, animal enrichment tab.

694
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,329
Hold on, wait.

695
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:08,470
What is this?

696
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,390
An enrichment objects enhance an exhibit area

697
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,339
for many species of animals

698
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:13,779
by keeping them active and entertained

699
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,690
in their environment.

700
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,069
So this is a pursuit ball.

701
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,829
There are many enrichment objects available

702
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:20,710
in Zoo Tycoon 2,

703
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,089
but for now we've narrowed the selection down to one.

704
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:26,710
An exercise ball.

705
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,150
All right, so let's watch them play with it.

706
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,269
Can I play with them in here?

707
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:33,099
They have different levels of interest.

708
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,440
We'll go into more detail later

709
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,200
about how to find out about what they do.

710
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,240
Okay, open the landscaping tab.

711
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,960
Jesus.

712
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,539
All the tools you need to create a proper habitat,

713
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:45,619
also known as a biome.

714
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:46,339
Click the check.

715
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,230
Okay, I need a savanna biome.

716
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,000
Savanna, okay.

717
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,789
So it needs to be a savanna in here.

718
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:01,509
After you find it,

719
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:04,710
move the cursor into the African Elephant's enclosure

720
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,789
and click and drag to start painting with the land

721
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:08,710
appropriate to the savanna biome.

722
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,589
Okay, so like this.

723
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:14,309
Does it matter?

724
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:19,109
It really is painting.

725
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:25,369
Are we sure?

726
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:28,329
This looks like hamster spray spread stuff.

727
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:32,680
Are we trying to trick the animal into thinking

728
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,039
this is just the bag of shit

729
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,160
that you get for your hamster?

730
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,890
That's not the savanna.

731
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:46,069
It's a pretty big hamster.

732
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,670
Imagine you had one hamster in here.

733
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:51,380
This is some richy rich asshole.

734
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,690
Didn't that happen in that movie?

735
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,849
He had like a little chipmunk friend

736
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,609
and he had a giant enclosure for it.

737
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:00,099
And the thing, it was like CG.

738
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:00,980
In the beginning of the movie,

739
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,420
they did this elaborate like four or five minute intro sequence

740
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,700
where he was doing like jumping

741
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,339
and flipping around on bars

742
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:09,779
and going to the ball pits and stuff.

743
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,380
It was like a fully animated sequence.

744
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:20,420
Great.

745
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,779
If real life beckons,

746
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,859
you can pause the game and never miss the action.

747
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,460
Keep in mind though that you can also build

748
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,740
while the game is paused.

749
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,779
Oh, that's good.

750
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:29,579
Like the Sims.

751
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,640
It can be helpful if guests or animals

752
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,079
move into an area where you want to build.

753
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,960
Just pause the game and move them out of the way

754
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,509
with the check button panel to continue.

755
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:40,869
Hire staff.

756
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:41,589
Okay.

757
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:44,200
There are a lot of different workers.

758
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,440
Okay.

759
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,400
We're just like the Sims.

760
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:51,130
We've got mascots, construction workers, crime, and musician.

761
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,599
That's the only four things anyone ever does in The Sims.

762
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,160
So that's good.

763
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,029
Maintenance, animal care, and guest education.

764
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:02,869
I kind of want the dinosaur guy.

765
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:07,900
Should I not have put him in there?

766
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,980
Should I not have put like dinosaur Gumby

767
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,340
inside of the elephant enclosure?

768
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:15,619
The zookeeper staff member specializes in animal care

769
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,380
and will make sure that your animals receive food

770
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,260
and water as needed.

771
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,090
It will also treat illnesses and groom dirty animals.

772
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,559
Okay.

773
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:27,349
So I want to put this is zookeeper staff.

774
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:28,469
Specialized in animal care.

775
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,099
Educator will enhance the educational experience

776
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:34,739
for your guests.

777
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,539
Place them somewhere.

778
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:40,869
Great.

779
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:41,510
You have an educator.

780
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,750
Educators need an educator podium to speak from.

781
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,269
Otherwise, the guests won't be able to hear them.

782
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,590
Now we need to make a podium.

783
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,269
So we need an educator podium.

784
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,010
I almost just put, okay.

785
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,769
I put down, let's put it on a soft drink stand.

786
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,360
Purchase an educator podium, click on the podium,

787
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
and give mouse over to see, yeah, yeah, yeah.

788
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,599
So don't forget the green screen.

789
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,880
Shows the position where the educator will stand

790
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,079
to speak to the guests.

791
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,960
So that has to be kind of right here.

792
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,570
They can go to work educating your guests

793
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,449
by educating your guests.

794
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,690
You can increase the amount of money you receive

795
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,210
from educational donations.

796
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:21,139
Great job.

797
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:22,579
This is the end of the construction tutorial.

798
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,699
The next tutorial will teach you a few things

799
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,619
about accessing information about your zoo.

800
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:26,579
Almost done.

801
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:27,780
To continue playing the next tutorial,

802
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,659
click the check mark.

803
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:29,059
Hold on.

804
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:29,699
We're almost done.

805
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,630
This is three of three.

806
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,989
And then I'm going to install mods

807
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:38,070
to make a 700 foot tall dinosaur.

808
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,570
Okay.

809
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,300
I'm not going to actually do that though.

810
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,340
Let's see.

811
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,460
We'll level it up in the world here.

812
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,980
Getting information.

813
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,659
In the following tutorial,

814
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:51,500
you learn the information about animal staff,

815
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,699
guest buildings, and your zoo stats.

816
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:53,980
Let's get started.

817
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,539
Click the check.

818
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,349
Okay.

819
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,340
All right.

820
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,860
I got a question for you.

821
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,300
Would you guys rather me continue like

822
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,260
to read these and talk

823
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,579
or silent for the next 10 minutes

824
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,300
and burn through this?

825
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,210
Because I'll just like zone in

826
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,449
and just like download this all into my brain.

827
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,400
All right.

828
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,119
I'll be quiet.

829
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:22,599
Here we go.

830
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:01,610
Okay.

831
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,210
See, I'm going much faster than I was before.

832
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,739
Great.

833
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,099
When you open the first animal band for me,

834
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,139
I'm on Moitakon's

835
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:08,340
in a state of the animal's needs.

836
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,179
They have needs.

837
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:14,579
What? He must...

838
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,659
His needs are a camel?

839
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,340
Click on the picture of the animal

840
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:21,800
information panel.

841
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,760
This enables tracking

842
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,360
and your camera will begin following this.

843
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,880
So he wants to eat the camel.

844
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,670
Okay.

845
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,710
Is this the tracking panel?

846
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,909
Now zoom in on the selected animal.

847
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:34,630
Get a better view.

848
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:38,039
Do I not already have a good view?

849
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,400
How is this?

850
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:47,380
I mean, I got a pretty great view right now.

851
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,170
I know you're hungry, but I...

852
00:37:59,130 --> 00:37:59,530
No, no.

853
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,969
Don't put him in a crate.

854
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,250
Get him out of the crate.

855
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:07,690
Get him out of the crate.

856
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:07,929
What?

857
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,099
A closer view will help you see the animal's

858
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:13,059
emoticons.

859
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,659
Emote of what?

860
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:16,179
Is that a disease?

861
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:21,750
Well, you know, fast forward 15, 20 years

862
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,710
after this game came out.

863
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,980
Some people would argue.

864
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,460
Yeah, it is.

865
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:30,340
About how animals tell you about their needs

866
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,739
and will tell you more about needs in a second.

867
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:34,650
When you're all through watching your animal,

868
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,769
click the check button.

869
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:37,690
Great.

870
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,570
Time to move on to learning

871
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,449
about the animal's needs.

872
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,179
Satisfied need.

873
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:43,619
The icons on the animal information panel

874
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,380
represent the animal's needs.

875
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,739
So here, just like the sims,

876
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:47,860
this is just animal sims.

877
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,340
I got it.

878
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,300
It means that the need is satisfied

879
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,260
and is all good.

880
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,139
Click the check button.

881
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:57,980
So when it's yellow,

882
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,860
it means they really have to,

883
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,059
they have to really have to go to the bathroom.

884
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,739
You need to make an animal bathroom for them.

885
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,269
Animal's thirst.

886
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:05,750
Oh, no.

887
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,750
The icon shown in this story

888
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,710
represents the animal's thirst.

889
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,150
When it's shown with a yellow overlay,

890
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,889
it means that the animal needs pressing.

891
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:14,889
This means that the animal will lie on his side

892
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:16,650
and you will squeeze on his stomach

893
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,090
until the juice is pressed out of his...

894
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:21,619
Soon trying to satisfy this need.

895
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,219
Click the check button.

896
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:32,730
The icon shown here represents the animal's hungry.

897
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,210
Yep.

898
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,329
Thirsty, hungry.

899
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:37,500
I don't know what that means.

900
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:39,420
Tired and needs exercise.

901
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,219
I already know.

902
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:43,260
It means that the need is critical

903
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,179
and the animal has not been able to satisfy it.

904
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:46,699
It's a good time to check your exhibit area.

905
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:47,820
Make sure the right objects,

906
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,340
in this case the right kind of foods,

907
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,980
are available.

908
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:56,619
This shows their heart rate.

909
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:57,420
Here's the status.

910
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,059
Current activity.

911
00:39:58,059 --> 00:39:59,420
Resting under the shade.

912
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,139
Exiting the shade.

913
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,320
Just like a rollercoaster tycoon.

914
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,030
Condition that you want to be aware of.

915
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,630
This is where you see whether an animal is ill

916
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,889
or expecting a new addition.

917
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:16,630
Oh, you can see if they're pregnant.

918
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,190
Well, I don't...

919
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,429
They lay eggs.

920
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:22,389
So you wouldn't be pregnant.

921
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,590
All animals lay eggs.

922
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,429
So at least I think they do.

923
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:28,460
The last tab on this panel

924
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,219
will take you to the animal's general information.

925
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:34,900
It's really fine information

926
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,340
about the animal's gender, preferred biome,

927
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,940
and which part of the world it originates in.

928
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,920
Quick check button on this panel.

929
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,079
Oh, I think my zookeeper is about to lay an egg.

930
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:48,090
Get a lot of helpful information

931
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,210
about an animal's preferences

932
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,969
using the zookeeper recommendations panel.

933
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:53,769
Okay.

934
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:55,690
So the zookeeper will tell you what they need,

935
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,650
what they want.

936
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,780
It's pretty easy.

937
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,219
Filter to include only those that are useful

938
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:02,579
to the animal you have selected.

939
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,679
You can choose objects from this panel

940
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,559
and place them in your zoo

941
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,519
just as you do with the other.

942
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,599
The biopanel is covered in the second tutorial.

943
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,400
Check the box on this panel to close it.

944
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,239
Mini tabs on the zookeeper

945
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,420
to see which foods, shelters, plants,

946
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,219
trees, and enrichment objects the animal prefers.

947
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:23,179
So here we go.

948
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:24,059
Foods they prefer.

949
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,019
$75 for a bunch of leaves.

950
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:31,750
What the fuck?

951
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,230
What?

952
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,949
Oh, I got.

953
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:33,269
All right.

954
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:35,539
I'm good.

955
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:38,949
You can use the mini tabs and close.

956
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,269
Recommend close the panel after.

957
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:42,309
This is all the stuff.

958
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,710
Rocks.

959
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,550
They like rocks.

960
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:48,440
See?

961
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,539
They're fans of those.

962
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:51,349
All right.

963
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:52,309
Close that up.

964
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,179
Locate a zookeeper in your zoo.

965
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,139
If they're not in the middle

966
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,500
of performing a specific task,

967
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,059
you might find them sitting on one of your benches.

968
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,269
They're a lot like real people after all.

969
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:04,469
Otherwise, they'll be walking around

970
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:05,429
tending to your exhibits,

971
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:06,550
clicking on a zookeeper

972
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,880
to open the zookeeper panel.

973
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,119
Okay.

974
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:19,619
This is Keeper Van Houten.

975
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:20,659
Staff status panels

976
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:22,789
where you see your zookeeper's current duty.

977
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:24,550
This is what your zookeeper is doing right now.

978
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,030
Click the check.

979
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,219
I can't wait to have a hundred bears in the set.

980
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:28,380
No.

981
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:29,260
What?

982
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,139
Are we going too far?

983
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:33,019
Slow down.

984
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,519
Click the check button.

985
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,639
This is the current duty.

986
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:39,659
Staff assignments if your zookeeper has assignments.

987
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:43,960
Okay.

988
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,079
You can assign zookeepers to specific exhibit areas

989
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,119
but assigning them,

990
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,159
let's stay there.

991
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:51,699
Keep them focused on the exhibits that you select.

992
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,780
If a zookeeper does not have an assignment,

993
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,860
they'll just head for an exhibit that needs attention.

994
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,659
Depending on your zoo,

995
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:58,739
this could mean that they do a lot of walking.

996
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:00,730
That's okay.

997
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,510
So here's how you make an assignment.

998
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,780
Cursor turns into a flag post.

999
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,980
Place the flag post in your zoo

1000
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,340
to assign a zookeeper to an exhibit area.

1001
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,340
When finished, right-click the mouse to clear the cursor.

1002
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,579
If you assign a zookeeper to more than one exhibit area,

1003
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:18,730
it may become ineffective.

1004
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,780
Click the check.

1005
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,500
Okay.

1006
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,300
So we realistically only just one here.

1007
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,139
So that's good.

1008
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:27,829
Staff thoughts.

1009
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:28,809
I love my job.

1010
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:33,690
This bench is comfortable.

1011
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:34,409
Does it?

1012
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:35,289
Yeah, man.

1013
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:38,039
That's pretty good.

1014
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:39,079
That's all you're thinking about.

1015
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:42,219
This is a comfortable bench.

1016
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,219
I love my job.

1017
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:46,820
Nothing else?

1018
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,420
That's a pretty clear mind.

1019
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,619
The staff thoughts panel is what you see,

1020
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:52,579
what you staff are thinking.

1021
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:53,780
Here you might get a bit of insight on

1022
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,699
whether there is something standing in the way of them

1023
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,170
caring for the animals, right?

1024
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,360
Staff salary.

1025
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,780
This is where you see the salary,

1026
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,739
how long they've been employed.

1027
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:08,380
$500 a month to be a zookeeper.

1028
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,280
Melissi loves that bench.

1029
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,719
Select a guest.

1030
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:18,920
Let's move on to the guests.

1031
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,550
Kid.

1032
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,659
Should we do kid or adult?

1033
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:28,900
How about Railmaster Rex BBQ?

1034
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,989
The guest activities and needs panel shows you

1035
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:33,510
what the guest is currently doing.

1036
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,579
Okay, yeah.

1037
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:37,699
Guest needs.

1038
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:40,820
Need a screen that's satisfied.

1039
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,940
If it's yellow, it's pressing.

1040
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,190
And if it's red, it's critical.

1041
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,710
Going to buy the soda.

1042
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,010
It's fucking Chad.

1043
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,860
Why does Chad have to appear in every video game?

1044
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,940
This is like 15 years ago.

1045
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,750
All right, this is status tab.

1046
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,949
This is hungry, hunger needs, thirst, rest,

1047
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,860
amusement, bathroom.

1048
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,139
Yeah, of course.

1049
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:15,619
Oh, select guest.

1050
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:17,300
Wow, this guy's loaded.

1051
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,449
This guy has in his bank account

1052
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:21,369
the amount of money that this guy,

1053
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:23,050
my zookeeper makes in a month.

1054
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,980
Jesus.

1055
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,550
That's like a lot of money in this universe.

1056
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,820
On this panel, you can see how much cash to get.

1057
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,059
NileCrocodile1 has been put in a crate.

1058
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,500
Why?

1059
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,559
What did he do?

1060
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,349
I don't know what that means yet.

1061
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:42,329
If the guest has purchased a souvenir in your zoo,

1062
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:43,929
click the check button.

1063
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:50,010
Click on the guest favorites tab.

1064
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,369
They really like camels.

1065
00:45:51,369 --> 00:45:51,929
Okay.

1066
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,219
Guest favorite animal.

1067
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:55,500
Guests are likely to make larger donations

1068
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,260
if they see their favorite animals.

1069
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,860
So stay on top of your guest favorites.

1070
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,940
You'll reap the reward of money

1071
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,570
coming in from donations and guest thoughts.

1072
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,690
You can see, don't you wish you could read

1073
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:08,969
everyone's mind this way?

1074
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:09,769
Not really.

1075
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:10,809
I really don't.

1076
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:14,710
I do not wish I could read everybody's mind

1077
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,869
because imagine if you could do that.

1078
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:19,670
Imagine like just shaking somebody's hand at the bank.

1079
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,750
Like, oh yeah, I'm banker one.

1080
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,630
Oh, hi, I'm guy.

1081
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,590
I'm guy one.

1082
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,469
Oh, nice to meet you.

1083
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:25,670
And you can read his mind.

1084
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,309
I don't like your nose.

1085
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:27,110
Your nose is ugly.

1086
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,230
It's just like, what the fuck?

1087
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,900
And then you can't even talk to the guy anymore.

1088
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,059
Or like, oh, I'm welcome to the bank.

1089
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:34,619
How you doing?

1090
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,019
Like, I'm going to shit my pants.

1091
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:37,820
I would laugh.

1092
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,670
How would you be able to do anything?

1093
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,710
Nothing would ever work.

1094
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:48,519
You would never be able to have a conversation ever again.

1095
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,039
If I could read people's minds, I wouldn't.

1096
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,969
No, that's a power I don't want.

1097
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:55,210
All right.

1098
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,690
So we need to hope the small restroom one line

1099
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,250
moves quickly.

1100
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,449
I really need to use the bathroom.

1101
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,969
I need to throw away this trash.

1102
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:02,409
I prefer something other than soda.

1103
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:07,820
I want something other than soda.

1104
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,420
All we got is soda.

1105
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,820
We just have Pepsi.

1106
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,019
That's it.

1107
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:15,179
All right.

1108
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:16,539
Select a food stand.

1109
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:17,559
Yeah.

1110
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:19,320
Buildings have information as well.

1111
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,650
Which, where are the food stands?

1112
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:27,860
That's a pretty good zoo setup.

1113
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,170
Here's a status panel.

1114
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,610
It's how much money things are.

1115
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,170
Yep.

1116
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,940
Items being sold.

1117
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,860
Some buildings may display slightly different information.

1118
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:42,309
Finance tab.

1119
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:43,190
Let's see how much it is.

1120
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:47,909
So this is price, low, moderate, or high prices.

1121
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:53,050
This is the balance sheet, which I will always be in the red for.

1122
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,349
To show whether it's turning a profit or not.

1123
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,829
Yep.

1124
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:59,079
Get a complete overview about how your zoo is doing.

1125
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,119
The zoo status page.

1126
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,000
Here's the money tab.

1127
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,949
This is going to just, yeah, it's how much money you spent versus how much you've received.

1128
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:08,550
Mark your zoo is open or closed.

1129
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,510
This is how you open the zoo.

1130
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,789
Good to, that's actually really good to know.

1131
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,329
And an altered level of your admission prices.

1132
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:23,340
So wait, it costs money to come in and people are expected to give a bunch of money?

1133
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:28,599
I thought it was okay.

1134
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,539
When you close the zoo, all your guests will begin to leave.

1135
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:35,219
Click the check button on this panel to continue.

1136
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,230
Income and expenses tab.

1137
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,739
Monthly tally of your financial comings and goings.

1138
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:44,699
If you're seeing lots of red, your zoo is probably spending more than it's receiving.

1139
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:46,300
Remember green is good.

1140
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,300
And this is one place where you don't want to be looking through rose colored glasses.

1141
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:53,019
Click the check button on this panel to continue.

1142
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,559
Zoo fame.

1143
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,139
Shows you how many animals you have, how happy people are.

1144
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:01,860
There's an award ceremony probably at the end of the year.

1145
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,539
Like in every single one of these video games.

1146
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:05,429
You can mouse over them.

1147
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,559
The more animals you have in your zoo, the more famous it becomes.

1148
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:11,320
Animal happiness, guest education.

1149
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,159
Releasing animals into the wild really increase fame for your zoo.

1150
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,539
Does that mean like open the gates to the elephant enclosure and just watch what happens?

1151
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:23,059
I mean, of course your zoo would be famous.

1152
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,019
I'll release them.

1153
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:31,139
I'm the omnipotent owner of the zoo.

1154
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,940
Here's like the nuclear launch code to unlock all the doors.

1155
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,550
I'll be so famous.

1156
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,030
All right.

1157
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,550
Zoo quick stats.

1158
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:47,780
This shows pretty much everything here.

1159
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,940
Illnesses can be very helpful at giving you an overview.

1160
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,110
So crocodile one.

1161
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,250
Uh oh.

1162
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,489
This represents the animals current privacy.

1163
00:49:56,489 --> 00:50:02,570
Animals can use shelters or lion grass or shade to regain their privacy as more guests view them.

1164
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,400
The crocodile wants more privacy.

1165
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,360
I know this is going to be fun.

1166
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,909
All right.

1167
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:08,630
This guest list.

1168
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,829
It shows everybody all the thing.

1169
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:10,949
Can't wait to see some animals.

1170
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:15,400
The camera will jump to that person if you click on it.

1171
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,320
And track the movements of the animal the person selected.

1172
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,650
Maybe another one of those don't you wish you could things.

1173
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,010
Why do you want this?

1174
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:24,340
What the fuck are you talking about?

1175
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,239
The guy that wrote the tutorial.

1176
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:32,570
You want to read everybody's mind and track everyone.

1177
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:41,480
Did Mark Zuckerberg make this game?

1178
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,550
Eventually, you know, his superpower started to become a reality.

1179
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:53,769
We got information on staff.

1180
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:55,849
You can see everybody, what everybody wants.

1181
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:59,639
Whereabouts have you staffed in the zoo?

1182
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:01,639
Camera will jump to that location and over there.

1183
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:03,480
Stamp information, what you can do.

1184
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,980
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1185
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,820
Waiting for job, waiting for job, waiting for job.

1186
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,469
What the hell was that?

1187
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:15,219
Which is fucking flashed by my screen.

1188
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:16,280
Okay.

1189
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,380
All right.

1190
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,000
I think we're ready.

1191
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,940
It's time to learn more about the photo safari.

1192
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,900
Photo mode.

1193
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,110
You can take a picture of this, yeah.

1194
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,550
When a photo challenge is available,

1195
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:32,340
you can right click to view the challenge.

1196
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,510
Take a picture of a drum dairy camel.

1197
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:40,059
This challenge asks you to take a picture of a drum dairy camel.

1198
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:41,420
Think you're up for the challenge.

1199
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,670
You can walk around using the left mouse button of the movie key.

1200
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,510
Locate a camel in your zoo.

1201
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,909
You can adjust the zoom of your camera in and out using the wheel.

1202
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:50,630
All right.

1203
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,309
What are you doing?

1204
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:56,309
What the hell are you doing?

1205
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:00,250
Was that kid just like going to the,

1206
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,010
was that, were you just like pissing over there?

1207
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,289
Hey, not allowed.

1208
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:27,340
You fucking idiot.

1209
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:27,900
Why'd you move?

1210
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,019
That was a good photo.

1211
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:35,800
Photo, yeah.

1212
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,349
This way you can take another look at the picture

1213
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:40,789
that you took for the photo challenge.

1214
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:43,239
Right click, photo challenge.

1215
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:43,800
Got it.

1216
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,469
You can view any of the photographs you've ever taken

1217
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,469
by opening your photo album tab.

1218
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:51,780
I don't recommend doing this on stream.

1219
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,750
Why?

1220
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,269
For the photo, the photos that you've just taken

1221
00:52:55,269 --> 00:52:57,750
are shown in the film strip below the top of the screen.

1222
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:16,809
You can click and drag them into empty slots in your photo album.

1223
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:19,369
30 animals, 10 different boomers,

1224
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:21,300
hundreds of objects, and more.

1225
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,300
Be sure to refer to the Zoo Tycoon 2 manual

1226
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,980
for even more in-depth information.

1227
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,849
Tutorials are marked with the book icon.

1228
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:28,409
I'm ready.

1229
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:28,969
Let's do it.

1230
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,139
Okay, here we go.

1231
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:40,460
Welcome to the stream, everybody.

1232
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:45,000
Feel like I have to run on a stage

1233
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,599
and start like screaming and pointing into the audience.

1234
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:51,400
It's been an hour.

1235
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,400
It's been, holy shit, it's been an hour.

1236
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,550
Whatever.

1237
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,110
We're ready.

1238
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:10,440
Play, when do we start with the campaign?

1239
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,239
Oh, fuck.

1240
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,940
There's like probably 10 tutorials.

1241
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:22,940
I don't know how to fucking play.

1242
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,860
Sandbox game?

1243
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,599
Oh, God.

1244
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,150
I'm not ready for this.

1245
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:39,320
I'm not ready for this.

1246
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:39,960
No.

1247
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,019
Let's get away with it.

1248
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:44,739
No tutorial.

1249
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,730
Zookeeper in training.

1250
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:50,980
See, you have a great opportunity to take over a small zoo,

1251
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,099
but you need to prove that you understand

1252
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:54,420
that animals have individual biome needs.

1253
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,219
Make sure each animal is moved into its appropriate biome exhibit

1254
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:58,820
and run your new zoo for one month.

1255
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,429
Complete all scenarios in this campaign

1256
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:05,670
and you'll get like 50 times somebody's income.

1257
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:11,019
I need to understand.

1258
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:12,940
You will play and you'll like it.

1259
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,420
Just wait.

1260
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,460
I need to, let me just get,

1261
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,099
let me just ease into the game.

1262
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,230
$30,000 a month.

1263
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:24,519
Just let me do this first.

1264
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:26,599
I need to, I can't just jump into sandbox mode.

1265
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:33,159
Look, I need to learn the very basics of like color

1266
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:35,400
and paint and canvases.

1267
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:40,280
Don't just dump the most expensive tools into my backyard and say,

1268
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,519
I expect the Mona Lisa in 10 minutes.

1269
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:43,719
So I don't even know how,

1270
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,480
I don't even know what the, what RGB means.

1271
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,679
What does it even stand for?

1272
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:51,349
All right, great opportunity to take over a small local zoo.

1273
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,389
For however, the current owner wants to be sure

1274
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:56,869
that you understand that animals have individual needs.

1275
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:58,550
He's provided you with three animals

1276
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,289
that need to be placed in their appropriate biome exhibit.

1277
00:56:01,289 --> 00:56:02,570
Each animal can be found in a crate

1278
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,769
at the front entrance of your zoo.

1279
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:04,409
When you select the crate,

1280
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:06,409
the information panel indicates what kind of animals inside.

1281
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:09,769
Pick up the crate and move it like any other object.

1282
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:12,170
To release an animal from its crate, click on crate.

1283
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,449
You need to move and release each animal.

1284
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:15,050
Yeah, yeah, to verify you can handle the basics.

1285
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,889
You've also been tasked to run the zoo for one month

1286
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:17,929
and ensure the animals survive.

1287
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:19,610
Tip, in the interest of keeping your animals alive,

1288
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,449
you want to provide them with food and water.

1289
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:25,929
I get, I don't, I don't understand.

1290
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,409
Do the things need to eat and drink?

1291
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:30,969
Release each animal from its crate

1292
00:56:30,969 --> 00:56:32,329
and place an appropriate exhibit.

1293
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,010
That's, I got 15 minutes to do this.

1294
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:37,510
Okay, I accept the challenge.

1295
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,480
Here we go.

1296
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,000
Welcome to Zoo Tycoon 2.

1297
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:48,489
Where are those crates?

1298
00:56:48,489 --> 00:57:04,699
These are at the entrance, right?

1299
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:11,559
Oh, here are the three animals.

1300
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:19,750
Okay, how do I grab them?

1301
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:20,550
Where's the music?

1302
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,809
Okay, this is a hippopotamus

1303
00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:43,480
and needs to be in a wetlands biome.

1304
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,920
No, don't, no, no, go back in.

1305
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:51,099
So this looks pretty wet over here.

1306
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:52,380
Don't just drop them in the ocean.

1307
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,019
All right, here we go.

1308
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:54,619
This looks pretty, this is wetlands right here.

1309
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:02,090
Okay, looks good.

1310
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:03,690
Let's uncrate the hippopotamus.

1311
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:08,059
I hope you like your new area.

1312
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,400
We got, this is a polar bear.

1313
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:18,440
It needs to be in a tundra, which is right here.

1314
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:29,030
And we need to put the lion into the savanna.

1315
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:33,030
I did it.

1316
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,630
Polar bear needs more space.

1317
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:35,130
What?

1318
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,949
Run the zoo for one month

1319
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:38,150
and ensure that you have all three animals

1320
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,030
in your zoo at the end of the month.

1321
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,849
What do you mean he needs more space?

1322
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:46,659
Do you have the biggest exhibit here?

1323
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:49,219
This is, this is enough for like 25 polar bears.

1324
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:51,659
All right, that's, you're good.

1325
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:53,820
Let's open the zoo.

1326
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,750
The zoo is open.

1327
00:58:56,389 --> 00:58:58,519
I'm ready to make this first challenge

1328
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:00,760
and then we can move on to the more difficult tasks.

1329
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,639
All right, so we need buildings.

1330
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:07,300
I want to get, we need educator podium

1331
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,349
right at the beginning here.

1332
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:12,230
Now release them.

1333
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:17,940
I'm not going to release the animals.

1334
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,260
Look, I need to make the person in the video game

1335
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,059
that you walk by in the first five to 10 minutes

1336
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,659
of the story and it's the guy sitting there preaching

1337
00:59:26,659 --> 00:59:29,059
in front of the first, like after the first cut scene

1338
00:59:29,059 --> 00:59:33,000
that you walk by right there.

1339
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,500
Okay, we need an educator.

1340
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:43,059
There's one person, Jeremy Albertson.

1341
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:44,420
Holy shit, that was close.

1342
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,550
All right, what do you need?

1343
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,539
I can't wait to see some animals

1344
00:59:50,539 --> 00:59:51,820
going right for the hippopotamus.

1345
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,519
All right, two guests now.

1346
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:04,019
How much is this place?

1347
01:00:04,019 --> 01:00:05,300
Okay, how much is it?

1348
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,630
$50.

1349
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:10,440
No, it's, just make it 20 bucks.

1350
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:19,300
Okay, here's Jim Ben Dixon wants to see a warthog.

1351
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,619
Well, hold on a minute here.

1352
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:22,789
Warthog.

1353
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:26,070
Do I have access to warthog?

1354
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:31,780
Velociraptor.

1355
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,579
Why would a velociraptor be here right now?

1356
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,099
What is he going?

1357
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:04,550
He's going to take a shit in the corn.

1358
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,469
He's going to kill guests.

1359
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:09,420
No, I'll take care of this.

1360
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,070
Hey, get out of here.

1361
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:27,030
Oh, he wants to go in.

1362
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,070
You want to go in there?

1363
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,809
No, you can't go in there yet.

1364
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:32,409
There's nothing in there.

1365
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:37,179
He wants to go in and eat the hippopotamus.

1366
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:45,110
Where is it?

1367
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:56,019
Does that help?

1368
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:57,460
Where is he going?

1369
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:01,829
Uh-oh, there's one random guy.

1370
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:07,690
Hey, come on in and see our new mascot, the velociraptor.

1371
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:16,360
This biome is not suitable for velociraptor one.

1372
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,780
What's he thinking about?

1373
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,619
Family tree.

1374
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:24,820
No family tree yet.

1375
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:48,010
All right, well, I told you I can't go off the rails yet.

1376
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:54,920
Get rid of the raptor.

1377
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,239
What do I do?

1378
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:55,960
How do I get rid of him?

1379
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:04,760
Hold on.

1380
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,119
Why is there like no audio?

1381
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:09,349
There's no audio in this game.

1382
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:17,659
There's no guns in this game.

1383
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:19,929
Line one is not contained.

1384
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:23,210
What do you mean line one is not contained?

1385
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:26,969
Oh, wait, I deleted the fence.

1386
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:31,349
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1387
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,889
He's figuring it out.

1388
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:36,940
I guess I could walk through here.

1389
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:43,260
Where is he going?

1390
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,300
Where is he going?

1391
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:45,940
Oh, no.

1392
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:47,699
Oh, shit.

1393
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:48,820
He's sprinting.

1394
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,059
Who is he sprinting?

1395
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,179
This guy's going to shit his pants.

1396
01:03:52,179 --> 01:03:58,900
He's like, I can smell it.

1397
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:06,840
I need to turn the fucking audio up.

1398
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,960
Polar bear is hungry.

1399
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:22,489
All right, delete game.

1400
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:23,369
Whatever, save game.

1401
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:36,230
The whole game closed.

1402
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,650
I need to turn the sound up.

1403
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,250
All you can hear is every so often you hear.

1404
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:50,099
All right, I'll get in the sandbox.

1405
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:51,860
I know how the game works.

1406
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:56,500
There it comes.

1407
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,260
Hopefully, it's not loud when you hear this.

1408
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:00,730
It probably will be, though.

1409
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,690
So just brace yourself.

1410
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:11,559
Oh, I told you I knew it.

1411
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:13,239
I fucking knew it.

1412
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:14,199
I tried to warn you.

1413
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:25,239
That's better.

1414
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:26,280
That's actually kind of loud.

1415
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,360
That's too loud now.

1416
01:05:29,909 --> 01:05:38,949
40 and like 43, 35, 38.

1417
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,179
All right, let's play.

1418
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:46,460
I don't know how to take care of dinosaurs,

1419
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,179
but I'll figure it out.

1420
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:55,579
How about no, let's go.

1421
01:05:55,579 --> 01:05:59,719
What's wrong with the world right now?

1422
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,400
What does this take place?

1423
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,880
Half the world is under water.

1424
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:06,730
Oh shit.

1425
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:11,619
Is this like post-apocalyptic?

1426
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:20,360
This is what's left.

1427
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:23,639
One giant road through Russia.

1428
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,239
Filters.

1429
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:33,610
All right, let's do.

1430
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,070
We can't just go right to the extinct animals.

1431
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,190
We'll do medium.

1432
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:47,610
Medium in Western Europe.

1433
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,889
Let me just do something normal.

1434
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:51,449
You know what I mean?

1435
01:06:51,449 --> 01:06:53,530
No dinosaurs, no aliens.

1436
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,760
Okay, here we go.

1437
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,710
Trying to make my park.

1438
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:08,599
I don't like this place.

1439
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:15,320
This is like a 2007 World of Warcraft zone.

1440
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,519
I don't want to do this one.

1441
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,739
All right, well, whatever.

1442
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:23,059
Let's just, we'll work with what we got.

1443
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,219
Start the process.

1444
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:26,940
Landscaping.

1445
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:33,539
I want, let's get some paths here.

1446
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:34,099
No, no, no, no.

1447
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:34,739
I want a path.

1448
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,590
There's so many people parked out here

1449
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,949
waiting for this to open.

1450
01:07:38,949 --> 01:07:43,639
What was the pathing tool?

1451
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:44,760
Right here.

1452
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,360
Okay, so asphalt path.

1453
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,989
I'm going to just simply,

1454
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,389
I'm going to follow the tutorial here.

1455
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:54,809
I can expand up there later.

1456
01:07:59,050 --> 01:07:59,849
That looks good.

1457
01:07:59,849 --> 01:08:00,250
All right.

1458
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:06,570
And then we're going to come across this way.

1459
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,650
We're going to have small exhibits.

1460
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:11,690
Very small, not huge.

1461
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:14,730
This is, this is going to have rabbits in here.

1462
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,810
If you think I'm going to put lions and polar bears, no.

1463
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:19,130
We're going to have goats, rabbits,

1464
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,770
and then a couple of pigs.

1465
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:34,010
This is going to be essentially the

1466
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,850
part of the county fair that you go to

1467
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,289
that has the shitty pumpkin contest

1468
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:40,649
and then the random pigs.

1469
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,409
No, whoops.

1470
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:45,380
How do I, how do I delete you?

1471
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,640
This is not, how are people going to get up there?

1472
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,460
That's so ugly.

1473
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,020
What have I done?

1474
01:08:56,649 --> 01:09:03,640
What's the, what's the bulldoze button?

1475
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,039
There it is.

1476
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,420
Okay, that's better.

1477
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:17,720
But turbo, that side's not, it's not exact.

1478
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,279
That's fine.

1479
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:18,680
Whatever.

1480
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,279
We just make like a fucking spatula.

1481
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:24,279
I'll move this one over.

1482
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:31,210
Now it'll be fine.

1483
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,729
Everyone can relax.

1484
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:42,359
So that means it needs to be one, two, three, four.

1485
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:48,010
So we need one, two, we need one, two, three, four.

1486
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,409
One, two, three, four.

1487
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:54,119
Oh, fuck me.

1488
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:06,869
What, a turbo?

1489
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,069
You did a good job, man.

1490
01:10:08,869 --> 01:10:11,670
Could I pick a shittier level?

1491
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:13,670
I just picked a random place in Europe.

1492
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,430
Let's start with the amenities.

1493
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:19,989
Extinct research lab.

1494
01:10:21,579 --> 01:10:22,779
Entertainer stage.

1495
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:23,739
Absolutely.

1496
01:10:23,739 --> 01:10:32,250
But this is a dinosaur one though.

1497
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:36,680
So how we're going to make this is you have to cross this path.

1498
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:39,479
So you're going to get bang, bang.

1499
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:40,600
There's no way to go around it.

1500
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,979
You have to go like this.

1501
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:51,859
And it's going to be a donation box, donation box.

1502
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:56,819
We're going to start the donation process the second you enter.

1503
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:02,890
So we got, I need like three, hold on a minute.

1504
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:08,970
Dino capture team bunker.

1505
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:12,579
What, what the hell is that?

1506
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:20,649
Sabertooth tiger, paleontologist.

1507
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:22,329
We have to have the dinosaur entertainer here.

1508
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,109
How am I going to have on one stage?

1509
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:35,079
We have to make an entire ensemble children's television show cast.

1510
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:45,460
That's all you do.

1511
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,060
You just dance forever.

1512
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:56,250
Coming up next on Disney Jr.

1513
01:11:58,010 --> 01:11:59,050
The dinosaur troop.

1514
01:11:59,609 --> 01:12:08,739
All right, so that's fine.

1515
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:11,029
Why are they running around wild?

1516
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,340
Now, you know what?

1517
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:13,979
You're fired.

1518
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:16,939
You're fired.

1519
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,000
You're fired.

1520
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:20,409
You're fired.

1521
01:12:20,409 --> 01:12:22,409
Anybody that gets off that stage is fired.

1522
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:34,680
We found the one employee.

1523
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,130
That was a test.

1524
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:45,050
That was a test to find out who really was dedicated.

1525
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:45,609
I'm going to see you.

1526
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,659
Dinosaur Kimmy.

1527
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,300
And that means you get a raise.

1528
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:54,659
I don't think I can.

1529
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:56,420
How do I, I can't raise.

1530
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,050
I love my job.

1531
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:00,250
I hope the crowd likes my show.

1532
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,210
It's time to do a show.

1533
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:09,510
That's so, that park didn't even open yet.

1534
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:16,939
All right, hold on.

1535
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:19,479
Why, why did that happen?

1536
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:20,520
Why am I in water now?

1537
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:22,149
Okay.

1538
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:23,529
All right.

1539
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:27,189
Now we need, uh, no, stop running away.

1540
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,590
Whatever.

1541
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:28,550
You'll figure it out.

1542
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,109
Transportation.

1543
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:29,829
We can do jeeps.

1544
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,619
Jeep vehicle station.

1545
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:33,340
Are you serious?

1546
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,859
Where did you come from?

1547
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:35,100
Hold on.

1548
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,539
Did that person just trade?

1549
01:13:36,539 --> 01:13:38,600
We're going to have a jeep.

1550
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,239
It's too much.

1551
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:39,560
Hold on.

1552
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,880
And you get in here.

1553
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:48,939
Jeep vehicle station.

1554
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,699
Oh, I gotta get rid of this.

1555
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,649
All right.

1556
01:13:58,649 --> 01:14:01,670
So then now, crossing gate road.

1557
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:04,250
Click dislike.

1558
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,090
Then place a crossing gate.

1559
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:08,649
We keep pedestrians from crossing a road where a jeep is.

1560
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:14,090
Hold on there.

1561
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:16,810
Which allows jeep vehicles to enter and exit animal exhibits.

1562
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:17,449
Holy shit.

1563
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:26,020
This is going to be so boring.

1564
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,020
No, undo.

1565
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:47,210
Oh, come on, man.

1566
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,479
I'm trying to move.

1567
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,380
I'm trying to move this.

1568
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:01,140
What the fuck are you doing?

1569
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:02,739
Why?

1570
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:02,979
What?

1571
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,329
Okay.

1572
01:15:12,329 --> 01:15:12,810
Here we go.

1573
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,619
I can't beat that.

1574
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:29,819
Just absolutely.

1575
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,359
I mean, giving people a chance.

1576
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:39,960
All right.

1577
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,199
Jeep transportation circuit is complete.

1578
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:43,989
All right.

1579
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:44,710
So let's put in.

1580
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:49,909
We gotta have at least one.

1581
01:15:53,829 --> 01:15:54,229
All right.

1582
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:54,710
Here we go.

1583
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:02,659
I don't think I can put one here.

1584
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,899
This is going to get so backed up.

1585
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,329
This ride is going to take forever.

1586
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,239
Two strands of Sky Team cable.

1587
01:16:20,119 --> 01:16:20,520
What?

1588
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,039
You can do a cable car too?

1589
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:27,159
Oh, this is just a lawsuit.

1590
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:29,590
We just need to see what happens.

1591
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:29,909
All right.

1592
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:33,739
Uh, so you got the two dinosaurs

1593
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:34,619
running around in circles.

1594
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:35,899
Tank building.

1595
01:16:38,619 --> 01:16:39,500
Wall for water.

1596
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,100
This is why I didn't want all the painters tools.

1597
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:47,079
This is why I didn't want all the tools at once.

1598
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,939
All right.

1599
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,340
Let's make some, let's make some habitats.

1600
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:59,029
So this is going to be, let's get a, okay.

1601
01:16:59,029 --> 01:16:59,350
Fence.

1602
01:17:00,069 --> 01:17:04,489
This is chain link fence on a tight budget.

1603
01:17:04,489 --> 01:17:07,609
I mean, we're not, but just that's fine.

1604
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:09,050
Let's go here.

1605
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:17,159
That looks good.

1606
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,560
Get an entrance.

1607
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,060
Another, let's just do chain link fence for now.

1608
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,630
Oh, whoops.

1609
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:36,949
So it has to go down to here.

1610
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:44,569
That's enough room for a half of a chimpanzee.

1611
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:47,689
Well, that's fine because it's not the right climate.

1612
01:17:51,689 --> 01:17:53,770
These are tiny, but that's for the gerbil.

1613
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:02,090
Look, I'm just trying to, this isn't set in stone yet.

1614
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:02,329
Okay.

1615
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:07,020
I just want to make sure I know what I'm doing.

1616
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:22,699
We can make habitats and staff members.

1617
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:23,180
There you go.

1618
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:29,560
Just directionless.

1619
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:34,460
Absolutely no direction.

1620
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,789
It doesn't know what time it is.

1621
01:18:36,789 --> 01:18:37,590
It doesn't know what day it is.

1622
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:43,529
It doesn't know the last time.

1623
01:18:49,609 --> 01:18:53,529
I told you, I told you, I can't see in the suit that well.

1624
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:57,140
He's just running into shit.

1625
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:03,159
He doesn't have eye holes.

1626
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:04,520
What is he doing?

1627
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,560
He's just panicking.

1628
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:09,640
I only know how to do one thing.

1629
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:11,979
Might as well do the one thing I know.

1630
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:15,590
Look at that sweat mark.

1631
01:19:18,899 --> 01:19:19,300
Okay.

1632
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,899
So we need a couple more of these habitats.

1633
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:32,390
Do I need somebody to drive?

1634
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,630
Okay.

1635
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:33,029
There we go.

1636
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:34,470
Now, animals.

1637
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:35,109
Let's see what we got.

1638
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,060
Armadillo.

1639
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,340
I mean, that's not a cool animal.

1640
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:40,649
We need small animals.

1641
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:41,449
So beaver.

1642
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:44,340
Beaver would work.

1643
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:47,609
I need rabbits.

1644
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,319
Here, what's this?

1645
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:52,760
Fox.

1646
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:53,560
That's a little too big.

1647
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:59,560
Oh, there's turkeys.

1648
01:19:59,560 --> 01:19:59,880
Okay.

1649
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,800
Maybe a bunch of turkeys.

1650
01:20:03,109 --> 01:20:05,350
It's penguins.

1651
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,399
There's so many different animals.

1652
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:20,630
Now, let's start small because I was supposed to start small.

1653
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:24,329
Ostrich.

1654
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:25,369
No.

1655
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:27,130
Beaver.

1656
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,010
We need something a little.

1657
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:28,729
Fox is fine.

1658
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:29,369
Fox is a little.

1659
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:31,050
I don't need that much space.

1660
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:40,470
A water loving rodent from North America needs wetlands biome.

1661
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:41,779
Okay.

1662
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,100
So let's make wetlands biome.

1663
01:20:46,859 --> 01:20:47,979
We need wetlands.

1664
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,380
That's going to be the main attraction, by the way.

1665
01:20:52,380 --> 01:21:01,399
And this is going to make some water.

1666
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:04,170
Like shallow water over here.

1667
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:06,470
And then make it a little deep.

1668
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:10,010
Make it shallow in the ends.

1669
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:10,409
Oops.

1670
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:18,390
All right.

1671
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:18,869
Looks good.

1672
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:22,039
Deep, shallow, and then dirt.

1673
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:23,819
We need, let's go like that.

1674
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:25,180
All right.

1675
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,260
Putting our first animal in the exhibit.

1676
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:29,560
American beaver.

1677
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:43,180
An American beaver in Europe.

1678
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:43,739
That's too many.

1679
01:21:44,659 --> 01:21:45,220
You're fired.

1680
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:48,890
They need more space.

1681
01:21:55,159 --> 01:22:06,630
No, don't let them out.

1682
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:24,619
Now we just got to get rid of these fences here and extend the habitat.

1683
01:22:24,619 --> 01:22:30,779
There you go, guys.

1684
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:34,569
Okay.

1685
01:22:34,569 --> 01:22:35,369
Habitat.

1686
01:22:35,369 --> 01:22:36,010
Wetlands.

1687
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:39,000
Ah, I know.

1688
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:39,399
Don't worry.

1689
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,229
That's not enough space for you.

1690
01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:59,829
How is there a guest in here?

1691
01:22:59,829 --> 01:23:03,380
How did you get in here?

1692
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,100
Why are you angry?

1693
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:04,899
Who the fuck are you?

1694
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,380
This park's not even open.

1695
01:23:13,899 --> 01:23:16,060
It doesn't look like American beaver has enough space.

1696
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,260
American beaver looks unhappy.

1697
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:17,979
I'm going home.

1698
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:31,699
This park is, did you let, is this like the dinosaur's family?

1699
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:32,420
No, it's closed.

1700
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,920
Get out of here.

1701
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,600
One of these idiots opened the park.

1702
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,609
Okay, hold on.

1703
01:23:41,609 --> 01:23:45,640
Let's get some food here.

1704
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,720
Animal food for a beaver.

1705
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,819
I need, oh wait, I need a zookeeper.

1706
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:56,569
Let's get a couple of zookeepers.

1707
01:23:56,569 --> 01:23:59,529
Why the fuck are you running away?

1708
01:23:59,529 --> 01:24:01,529
How do you need more space than this?

1709
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,579
Okay.

1710
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:06,060
Food.

1711
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,180
What does, what does beaver eat?

1712
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:11,619
I need to like click on their tab here.

1713
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:13,350
All right.

1714
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:16,310
Uh, space is critical.

1715
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:17,659
What are you doing?

1716
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:19,420
Are you breaking up shit in the bottom?

1717
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,220
Are they dead?

1718
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,439
Why are they lying down?

1719
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:26,840
Are they breaking shit up on the bottom of the ocean?

1720
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:37,210
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1721
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:47,640
Deep water.

1722
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,520
That's not deep enough.

1723
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:53,739
The zoo only has beavers.

1724
01:24:53,739 --> 01:24:58,300
Well, the zoo only has beavers because it, they're angry with me.

1725
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:03,140
This one's happy.

1726
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:04,659
All right, we need food.

1727
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,520
We need branches.

1728
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,359
So we can put like branches here.

1729
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:14,890
Hollow log with lettuce.

1730
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:16,250
Oh, they're all going for it.

1731
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:16,810
Quick.

1732
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,329
It's a race to get the food.

1733
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,789
Who's the alpha beaver?

1734
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:28,279
Uh, lettuce pile.

1735
01:25:28,279 --> 01:25:30,340
There we go.

1736
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,060
See now they're happy.

1737
01:25:33,979 --> 01:25:34,539
Food, dish.

1738
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:43,689
They really are fighting each other.

1739
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,149
All right.

1740
01:25:46,149 --> 01:25:47,670
They need more space though.

1741
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:49,270
Is this going to be just a beaver zoo?

1742
01:25:50,069 --> 01:25:54,550
Look, pile of branches.

1743
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,750
You guys can like play over here.

1744
01:25:59,109 --> 01:25:59,829
Animal shelters.

1745
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:01,029
They don't need an animal shelter.

1746
01:26:01,029 --> 01:26:06,310
They're, they, they, they need more land.

1747
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:08,939
Okay.

1748
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:10,460
Well, I'll take down this shit then.

1749
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:12,329
You need more land?

1750
01:26:12,329 --> 01:26:12,890
Pause the game.

1751
01:26:13,529 --> 01:26:14,489
I'll give you more land.

1752
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:36,199
I get complaints now.

1753
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,039
Then I'm going to be very upset.

1754
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:41,930
Wetlands.

1755
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:42,970
Go with the grass.

1756
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,970
Let's extend the big pool.

1757
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:53,189
Let's do, let's get shallow water this way.

1758
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:01,000
Because then I'll do deep here.

1759
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,359
So they can at least hang out over there.

1760
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:10,520
Oh, the stupid fucking thing's in the way.

1761
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,460
Okay.

1762
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:17,220
Shallow water.

1763
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,420
American beaver is not contained.

1764
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,539
Well, it's, the game's paused.

1765
01:27:21,539 --> 01:27:22,100
Everything's fine.

1766
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:26,310
All right, here we go.

1767
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:30,710
We need to get this one closed in.

1768
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:34,329
And then this needs to be closed in.

1769
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:38,220
I don't, why did I even build this?

1770
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:40,699
The road thing.

1771
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,779
I was just, I'm like a child.

1772
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:44,899
I had to make it.

1773
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:48,260
All right.

1774
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,140
That's enclosed.

1775
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:50,979
I'm ready to turn it back on.

1776
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,380
Let's get some food in here for them.

1777
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:57,750
Okay.

1778
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:58,470
Mr. Ranger.

1779
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:01,529
We've got, uh, let's, the food.

1780
01:28:01,529 --> 01:28:06,039
Let's put some rocks.

1781
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:07,159
Let's give them a couple of rocks.

1782
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,340
That's too big of a rock.

1783
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,699
That's also too big of a rock.

1784
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,380
Just get like two or three, like,

1785
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:14,060
dinosaur droppings over here for you to play with.

1786
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:15,819
Uh, plants.

1787
01:28:16,619 --> 01:28:19,829
All right.

1788
01:28:19,829 --> 01:28:22,550
Uh, a little log that I'm sure they're going to love that.

1789
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:25,510
And then let's get some toys.

1790
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:29,289
This doesn't go in the water.

1791
01:28:29,289 --> 01:28:30,890
It goes just like going to the edge here.

1792
01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:32,409
We'll put one down here.

1793
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,659
Uh, Misty Spring.

1794
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:38,500
That's a huge log.

1795
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,760
Beavers love logs.

1796
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,199
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

1797
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:45,079
Right in the corner here.

1798
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,399
And then we need, I think we need more food.

1799
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:52,409
Hollow log with lettuce.

1800
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:54,649
Yeah, we'll put the, that's like a little snack for them over here.

1801
01:28:55,989 --> 01:28:56,470
All right.

1802
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:57,270
No more complaints.

1803
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:06,340
Why do they sound like pigs?

1804
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:07,899
All right.

1805
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:08,539
What can I see?

1806
01:29:08,539 --> 01:29:09,020
What do you need?

1807
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:11,319
Comfortable the animal is.

1808
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:13,319
Hygiene needs.

1809
01:29:14,869 --> 01:29:15,109
All right.

1810
01:29:15,109 --> 01:29:15,590
We're good.

1811
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:19,109
This is just barely big enough for them, by the way.

1812
01:29:19,909 --> 01:29:20,149
How?

1813
01:29:21,819 --> 01:29:22,619
Social needs.

1814
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:26,279
They need to be social with other animals.

1815
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:29,909
Current simulation level.

1816
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:32,840
They'll spread out.

1817
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:34,979
Expand.

1818
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,159
I thought I can't expand.

1819
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,119
This is not going to be Beaver Park.

1820
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:46,170
This is a great exhibit right here.

1821
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:48,279
How is it?

1822
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:49,079
How are you not contained?

1823
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:49,640
You're in here.

1824
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:51,859
Social.

1825
01:29:56,069 --> 01:29:56,869
What's your problem?

1826
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:59,609
Put it up for adoption.

1827
01:30:00,409 --> 01:30:02,659
I need more fresh trees.

1828
01:30:06,579 --> 01:30:06,819
All right.

1829
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:08,100
Let's put in some fresh trees.

1830
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:11,189
Where's the ranger?

1831
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:13,029
I need ranger to tell me, uh, some help me here.

1832
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:13,829
All right.

1833
01:30:13,829 --> 01:30:14,550
American Beaver.

1834
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:18,149
Uh, tree.

1835
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:19,590
All right.

1836
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:20,470
Here we go.

1837
01:30:20,859 --> 01:30:31,619
They're going to have you get one, two trees and that should be good.

1838
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:37,270
They're all females.

1839
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,909
What?

1840
01:30:37,909 --> 01:30:46,340
What do you mean they're all female?

1841
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,020
I only put in females?

1842
01:30:53,020 --> 01:31:08,359
Uh, that's it.

1843
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:12,380
And that was enough to make it fine.

1844
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:21,539
I just deleted a beaver.

1845
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:22,739
I think I just killed a beaver.

1846
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,520
I just killed a beaver.

1847
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:34,119
I think they're going to kill each other.

1848
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:34,760
No, they're not.

1849
01:31:35,479 --> 01:31:37,739
This is part one.

1850
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,819
I'm going to delete this stupid fucking thing.

1851
01:31:40,819 --> 01:31:42,260
And that's going to make more room.

1852
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:47,060
I'll put some food and, and drinks down here.

1853
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,659
Over here is going to be the entrance with dinosaurs.

1854
01:31:48,659 --> 01:31:50,420
It's going to be two dinosaur dancers.

1855
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:51,220
And then we're going to go up.

1856
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:54,020
We're going to take a little monorail up this way.

1857
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:55,460
It's not just going to be Beaver Park.

1858
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:03,510
It's be it's the Beaver Park for the first five seconds.

1859
01:32:04,069 --> 01:32:15,430
Contain it.

1860
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:16,149
Just contain it.

1861
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:19,689
I build this later.

1862
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:27,399
American Beaver is not contained.

1863
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,039
It will be very soon.

1864
01:32:30,039 --> 01:32:30,359
Okay.

1865
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:31,399
Here we go.

1866
01:32:31,399 --> 01:32:32,600
Let's actually get this built.

1867
01:32:34,569 --> 01:32:37,289
And then I'm going to do extend the water.

1868
01:32:37,289 --> 01:32:39,689
And then I'm going to have a little island over here for them to hang out.

1869
01:32:39,689 --> 01:32:42,810
And on the island is going to be a fucking grizzly bear.

1870
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:45,300
So good luck beavers.

1871
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:49,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not going to happen.

1872
01:32:49,779 --> 01:32:56,100
Hey, you know, like I said, I wasn't going to go off the rails or the first like hour.

1873
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:58,710
I wonder what happened with that.

1874
01:33:01,859 --> 01:33:02,739
Oh, this is too far.

1875
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,520
Right here, right here.

1876
01:33:10,069 --> 01:33:10,869
Is that enough?

1877
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:12,710
How many beavers do I have?

1878
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:15,750
I haven't even checked that.

1879
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:18,699
Wetlands.

1880
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,859
Quick to include plants.

1881
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:25,020
Oh, wait, I can.

1882
01:33:26,579 --> 01:33:27,539
Oh, hold on a minute here.

1883
01:33:29,239 --> 01:33:31,159
Oh, it does it automatically.

1884
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:31,800
Would you look at that?

1885
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:39,479
See, but we need water.

1886
01:33:42,899 --> 01:33:45,380
It's making little lily pads for them.

1887
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,779
I need it.

1888
01:33:47,779 --> 01:33:49,380
I want like a little hangout zone here though.

1889
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:55,369
Like they can come over to the other shore.

1890
01:33:55,369 --> 01:33:56,329
They can swim to the other shore.

1891
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:59,979
All right.

1892
01:33:59,979 --> 01:34:01,180
Let's put food over here.

1893
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:01,819
What's this thing?

1894
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:03,899
No, I don't want to do that.

1895
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:07,340
Let's get some food over here.

1896
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,149
Needs more space.

1897
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:13,109
You'll get it in a second.

1898
01:34:13,109 --> 01:34:18,039
How about, uh, let's put some food dish with roots.

1899
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:19,319
Now let's put, how many do we have?

1900
01:34:21,399 --> 01:34:24,039
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

1901
01:34:24,039 --> 01:34:25,960
There's like fourteen or like fifteen.

1902
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:36,859
Let's go see.

1903
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:38,329
Look at that.

1904
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:47,369
And, and there's going to be a fun log over here.

1905
01:34:47,369 --> 01:34:50,380
They're enclosed, right?

1906
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:51,100
What do you say now?

1907
01:35:13,689 --> 01:35:14,569
They need more space.

1908
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,880
Move triangle.

1909
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:26,279
Hold on.

1910
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:26,600
Hold on.

1911
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,000
Hold on.

1912
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,279
I'm going to remove the triangle.

1913
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:34,979
I need more space.

1914
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:35,939
How many are in here?

1915
01:35:45,989 --> 01:35:46,470
All right.

1916
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:47,029
I'm sorry.

1917
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,359
How do I pick?

1918
01:35:55,979 --> 01:36:02,979
No, these are like pigs.

1919
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:05,420
No, I don't want to get rid of this one.

1920
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:06,140
This one's fun.

1921
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:09,479
This one's, oh, I like them all.

1922
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:12,579
All right.

1923
01:36:12,579 --> 01:36:19,029
How do I, uh, how do I put them up for adoption?

1924
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:26,420
I did it.

1925
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:28,180
I think I did it.

1926
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:29,060
No, I didn't.

1927
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:32,680
Did I do it?

1928
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,159
How?

1929
01:36:33,159 --> 01:36:34,359
You still need space.

1930
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:38,329
I'm trying to fire the beavers.

1931
01:36:39,899 --> 01:36:40,779
They still need space.

1932
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:44,069
Oh, okay.

1933
01:36:44,069 --> 01:36:46,600
Look at that.

1934
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,590
Done.

1935
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:52,310
Very cool.

1936
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:52,789
Very cool.

1937
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:55,779
Okay.

1938
01:36:57,109 --> 01:37:00,470
So now, interestingly enough, okay.

1939
01:37:01,909 --> 01:37:16,779
Let's, um, I'm just kidding.

1940
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:17,899
Let's go.

1941
01:37:21,289 --> 01:37:22,250
Spin out their numbers.

1942
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,529
Put in a crocodile.

1943
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:25,850
No, I'm not going to fuck with the beaver exhibit.

1944
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:26,810
It's the best thing we got.

1945
01:37:28,859 --> 01:37:29,579
Okay.

1946
01:37:29,579 --> 01:37:33,819
I've been doing this for so long.

1947
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:46,869
Get out of here.

1948
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:48,250
All right.

1949
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:51,449
Now we need, um, we have our beaver exhibit.

1950
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:54,090
Is that worth $50 to come in and see shitty beavers?

1951
01:37:54,649 --> 01:38:05,779
Let's go back to this.

1952
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:16,949
I can't just have it drive through the exhibit, guys.

1953
01:38:16,949 --> 01:38:18,310
I just started.

1954
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:24,460
I can't ruin everything.

1955
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:25,340
You know what I mean?

1956
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:26,460
We need to at least make this.

1957
01:38:29,619 --> 01:38:31,220
I can't do that right now.

1958
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:33,979
That's too much.

1959
01:38:34,539 --> 01:38:41,659
Maybe it, that's not safe, apparently.

1960
01:38:47,909 --> 01:38:48,630
There we go.

1961
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:52,250
It just needs to go around it.

1962
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,680
People still need to,

1963
01:38:57,399 --> 01:38:59,399
I need an enjoyable ride in this park.

1964
01:39:00,199 --> 01:39:02,939
You understand?

1965
01:39:05,619 --> 01:39:06,659
Everything here sucks.

1966
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,260
Nothing here is good.

1967
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:09,460
Everything sucks.

1968
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:17,420
You drive around in a go-kart around a beaver exhibit and it's 50 bucks.

1969
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,100
Actually, that's kind of cool.

1970
01:39:19,899 --> 01:39:21,260
That actually is pretty cool.

1971
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:21,739
Never mind.

1972
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:24,260
Staying corrected by myself.

1973
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:24,579
All right.

1974
01:39:24,579 --> 01:39:25,539
Uh, open it.

1975
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:27,979
Click to close the station.

1976
01:39:27,979 --> 01:39:29,739
No guests can enter when the station is closed.

1977
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:34,550
I think we need, but can we use it?

1978
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:35,590
Incomplete circuit.

1979
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:36,390
Oh, it's because of this.

1980
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:43,130
Okay, I need to build.

1981
01:39:47,829 --> 01:39:48,869
Change circuit direction.

1982
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,069
That's fine.

1983
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:54,090
So this should complete the circuit.

1984
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:57,420
Incomplete circuit.

1985
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:57,920
Where?

1986
01:40:03,859 --> 01:40:04,359
Fuck.

1987
01:40:06,279 --> 01:40:06,779
Oh well.

1988
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:19,750
Stupid motherfucker.

1989
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,020
Okay.

1990
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:47,279
Open.

1991
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:48,460
So how do we test it?

1992
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,220
What kind of jeep do we want to use?

1993
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:57,590
Definitely the Jurassic Park one.

1994
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:59,510
Click select and then place the decorated jeep.

1995
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:01,779
Yeah, place it, man.

1996
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,939
I should know this one.

1997
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:05,600
This one.

1998
01:41:06,779 --> 01:41:16,470
How many can I have?

1999
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:18,710
I guess I can have like more than five.

2000
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:22,489
Nobody who's even in these.

2001
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,560
I'm wasting so much money.

2002
01:41:26,199 --> 01:41:30,979
Are these guys going to never end just drive around the track with nobody?

2003
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:32,840
Can I get in?

2004
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,949
How do I get in?

2005
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,119
Wait, I own the place.

2006
01:41:40,119 --> 01:41:40,619
Let me in.

2007
01:41:48,149 --> 01:41:48,869
Oh, I can get on.

2008
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:53,479
See, we're taking a tour of Beaver Park.

2009
01:41:54,199 --> 01:41:59,939
What's this guy's problem?

2010
01:41:59,939 --> 01:42:00,659
Get back to work.

2011
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:06,409
What's going on?

2012
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:10,920
What's happening here?

2013
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,840
Hey, how do I beep the horn?

2014
01:42:21,319 --> 01:42:22,279
Actual traffic.

2015
01:42:23,079 --> 01:42:23,960
What's the issue here?

2016
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,359
Oh, look at how cute that is.

2017
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:31,720
Pick with my photo.

2018
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:46,550
I missed it.

2019
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:51,819
How do I fix this?

2020
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:52,880
Okay.

2021
01:42:54,649 --> 01:42:56,250
The terrain is impassable.

2022
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:59,880
How do I take care of that?

2023
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,520
All right.

2024
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:01,479
I think I know how to take care of it.

2025
01:43:17,819 --> 01:43:19,659
Capacity six.

2026
01:43:19,659 --> 01:43:20,159
Capacity.

2027
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:32,649
So, that's the ride there.

2028
01:43:32,649 --> 01:43:34,890
Looking good.

2029
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:35,289
Watch out.

2030
01:43:35,289 --> 01:43:35,609
Watch out.

2031
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:36,489
Watch out.

2032
01:43:36,489 --> 01:43:43,880
And now we just need guests to ride in the gigantic Jurassic Park funeral caravan, apparently.

2033
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:48,350
This is just like...

2034
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:57,260
I thought...

2035
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:58,220
Didn't I fire you?

2036
01:43:58,859 --> 01:43:59,550
Oh, no.

2037
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:00,109
You're the other one.

2038
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:03,880
Dino is back.

2039
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:04,920
All right.

2040
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:05,800
We're good.

2041
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,800
So now I got to make some decent roads.

2042
01:44:08,359 --> 01:44:20,680
Let's go up here because this will take you then straight through and then up here into

2043
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:27,500
the next exhibit, which we will determine what that is very soon.

2044
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:30,380
I don't know what the hell it's going to be, but it's going to be right here.

2045
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:34,920
Okay.

2046
01:44:35,789 --> 01:44:36,350
Looking good.

2047
01:44:36,909 --> 01:44:38,460
So, at this point...

2048
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:40,140
What the fuck?

2049
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:44,680
Okay.

2050
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,319
That looks fine.

2051
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:48,489
Zoo does...

2052
01:44:48,489 --> 01:44:49,289
I don't want to open it yet.

2053
01:44:49,289 --> 01:44:49,529
I need...

2054
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:52,250
That guy just fell out of the gate.

2055
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:54,329
Wait, he swam to the gate.

2056
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:54,649
The gate...

2057
01:44:54,649 --> 01:44:55,369
Where's the gate?

2058
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:59,159
Oh, for the love of God.

2059
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:03,869
I need more than one gate.

2060
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:05,550
Do they have food in here?

2061
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:09,199
Where?

2062
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:15,210
I feel like this is a people habitat as much as it is a beaver one.

2063
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:16,329
Watch out.

2064
01:45:16,329 --> 01:45:16,810
Watch out.

2065
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:17,289
Watch out.

2066
01:45:20,489 --> 01:45:20,890
Watch out.

2067
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:27,850
I have 25 employees whose job it is just to drive in a circle all day.

2068
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:41,369
So they can't be hurt.

2069
01:45:41,369 --> 01:45:42,250
That's good.

2070
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,210
That's very good to know.

2071
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:46,760
All right.

2072
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:54,119
So now I'm like lost on what I want to do next here.

2073
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:04,439
Let's make this a double just so there's enough room for people to watch.

2074
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:06,119
I want to have a donation exhibit here.

2075
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:10,510
I need some food, some stalls.

2076
01:46:11,229 --> 01:46:18,010
Let's try to get around this somehow.

2077
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:21,710
That has to go.

2078
01:46:29,470 --> 01:46:30,350
I'm so...

2079
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:32,909
I'm so glad that they can't get run over.

2080
01:46:37,949 --> 01:46:40,750
It's just a beaver prison.

2081
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:42,109
No, it's not.

2082
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:46,140
This is making me so nervous.

2083
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:48,060
I feel like someone's going to get fucking run over.

2084
01:46:53,630 --> 01:46:57,789
It's a beaver prison that is being constantly patrolled.

2085
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:03,689
Like a caravan of staff.

2086
01:47:03,689 --> 01:47:04,010
Okay.

2087
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:11,130
People can cross that.

2088
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:11,529
That's fine.

2089
01:47:16,569 --> 01:47:18,090
High security.

2090
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:19,369
High security for the beavers.

2091
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:21,739
Make sure nobody gets out of there.

2092
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:28,220
So how much electricity have I wasted so far?

2093
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:29,500
Let's take a look at my finances.

2094
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:37,850
Are you kidding me?

2095
01:47:38,489 --> 01:47:41,930
$260,000.

2096
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:49,760
At least I got a deductible of $7,700 this year in taxes.

2097
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,880
What is...

2098
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,800
The beavers are that expensive?

2099
01:47:59,609 --> 01:48:02,090
That's how much 10 beavers cost?

2100
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:03,979
That's not true.

2101
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:08,600
A beaver is like probably $60.

2102
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:16,430
They had to be imported from America because this is Europe.

2103
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,010
It was the dinosaurs.

2104
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:27,710
All right.

2105
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:28,750
Well, that's a wash though.

2106
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:29,710
This month doesn't count.

2107
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:34,170
Okay.

2108
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:38,010
Honestly, that's more confusing than if it was beavers because

2109
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:41,529
a T-Rex is definitely worth more than probably $50 million.

2110
01:48:42,489 --> 01:48:44,060
How much was a T-Rex?

2111
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:44,779
10 grand?

2112
01:48:44,779 --> 01:48:45,340
20 grand?

2113
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:48,300
No, don't...

2114
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:48,779
You can't...

2115
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:49,420
You can't fire.

2116
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:52,109
No, don't fire.

2117
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:53,149
All right.

2118
01:48:53,149 --> 01:48:53,550
We need...

2119
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,949
I need some kiosks here.

2120
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:59,369
We need ATM.

2121
01:48:59,369 --> 01:49:01,050
Yeah, we want to clean them out.

2122
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:10,649
Right behind that is the donation machine.

2123
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:14,350
Where's the donation machine?

2124
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:21,359
Yeah, you take out money from the ATM and you go directly

2125
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:23,199
to the fucking donation machine behind you.

2126
01:49:26,970 --> 01:49:27,930
Where is it?

2127
01:49:27,930 --> 01:49:30,880
That's an educator podium.

2128
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:36,039
Family restroom ATM.

2129
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:39,260
Is the zoo open yet?

2130
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:39,420
No.

2131
01:49:43,609 --> 01:49:44,489
Research lab.

2132
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:49,899
Am I missing something here?

2133
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:55,930
Wireless headsets?

2134
01:49:56,729 --> 01:50:02,039
Maybe it's over here.

2135
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:07,229
Gift cart.

2136
01:50:09,079 --> 01:50:10,279
Wireless headsets.

2137
01:50:11,239 --> 01:50:12,439
Cave painting hall.

2138
01:50:13,319 --> 01:50:15,279
Oh, here it is.

2139
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:15,520
Okay.

2140
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:17,689
Donation box.

2141
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:25,960
So let's spin this around over here and then do one over here as well.

2142
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:35,319
Guys, if you like the show, you know, consider wiping out your checking account.

2143
01:50:35,319 --> 01:50:37,880
Does this cost money to use?

2144
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,000
No, don't sell it.

2145
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,770
Okay.

2146
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:46,800
That's good.

2147
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,119
Okay.

2148
01:50:48,079 --> 01:50:48,720
All right.

2149
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:49,680
So I got money.

2150
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,479
I need food.

2151
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:53,310
Picnic table.

2152
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:53,630
We'll put it...

2153
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:54,829
We'll make a little spot over here.

2154
01:50:55,470 --> 01:51:01,930
Let's get some concrete, dirt, sand, brick, stone.

2155
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:05,520
This would be like the food area.

2156
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,960
This guy's dancing in the road.

2157
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:13,119
He's just getting beeped at.

2158
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:13,840
Get out of the way.

2159
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:22,720
Hey, come on.

2160
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,000
You got to make a living.

2161
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,460
So stone path.

2162
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:30,920
This is going to be the food court.

2163
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:32,479
So we're going to go this way.

2164
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:41,479
That's fine over there.

2165
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:44,859
That's good.

2166
01:51:44,859 --> 01:51:47,819
So there's going to be food, drinks, right at the beginning.

2167
01:51:47,819 --> 01:51:48,859
Put a bathroom over here.

2168
01:51:49,579 --> 01:51:50,460
Oh, maybe we won't.

2169
01:51:55,069 --> 01:51:56,109
Elevated paths.

2170
01:51:56,909 --> 01:51:57,550
Okay.

2171
01:51:57,550 --> 01:51:58,029
Buildings.

2172
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:01,399
So we need a...

2173
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:03,560
I need an educator podium in front of the beavers.

2174
01:52:04,199 --> 01:52:05,079
That's going to be over here.

2175
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:08,489
Really important.

2176
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:10,010
This is all I have.

2177
01:52:10,729 --> 01:52:14,750
I need an educator.

2178
01:52:15,470 --> 01:52:19,659
I need some maintenance workers too.

2179
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,000
A trainer.

2180
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:26,520
We can teach them tricks.

2181
01:52:28,189 --> 01:52:28,510
Cool.

2182
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:28,750
Okay.

2183
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:34,520
There's the educator podium for the beaver exhibit.

2184
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,859
I'm just poisoning with the carbon.

2185
01:52:43,819 --> 01:52:45,340
No, they're far enough away.

2186
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:46,140
Everything's going to be fine.

2187
01:52:46,699 --> 01:52:47,500
All right.

2188
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:48,939
I'm almost ready to open my zoo.

2189
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:50,859
Almost time.

2190
01:52:54,189 --> 01:52:55,390
Small restroom.

2191
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:59,600
Staff center.

2192
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,399
This is huge.

2193
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,970
It's going up here.

2194
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:07,939
Okay.

2195
01:53:10,119 --> 01:53:11,079
Name of the beavers.

2196
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,470
Not yet.

2197
01:53:13,470 --> 01:53:15,659
I gotta build some more stuff though.

2198
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:18,000
Okay, we need food.

2199
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,279
What do we get?

2200
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,560
I can't look at this.

2201
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,680
I'm going to get hungry.

2202
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,039
I really will get hungry looking at this.

2203
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:26,000
A sub sandwich.

2204
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,039
Subs are meat-filled sandwiches that are commonly devoured for lunch.

2205
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:30,319
Why would you word it like that?

2206
01:53:30,319 --> 01:53:30,640
Weird.

2207
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:34,750
Okay.

2208
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:35,310
Sub shop.

2209
01:53:36,029 --> 01:53:37,229
Uh, sushi.

2210
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:42,510
I need to put the sushi place in front of like an aquarium exhibit, don't I?

2211
01:53:43,229 --> 01:53:46,439
Well, that's really fun.

2212
01:53:46,439 --> 01:53:47,319
Why would I want to do that?

2213
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:51,739
No, that's normal, right?

2214
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:54,439
Salads.

2215
01:53:58,199 --> 01:53:58,600
Coffee.

2216
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:04,909
And water.

2217
01:54:04,909 --> 01:54:06,189
Make sure water is...

2218
01:54:06,189 --> 01:54:07,069
We need water over here.

2219
01:54:07,949 --> 01:54:11,529
Cotton candy.

2220
01:54:11,529 --> 01:54:12,409
Candy can cart.

2221
01:54:12,409 --> 01:54:12,890
No.

2222
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:13,529
Soda drinks.

2223
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:19,050
And hot dogs.

2224
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:22,319
All right.

2225
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:40,109
I think I'm almost ready to open the park.

2226
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:44,430
I'm ready.

2227
01:54:44,430 --> 01:54:45,069
No, not yet.

2228
01:54:45,789 --> 01:54:48,029
These are luxurious food stands.

2229
01:54:48,029 --> 01:54:49,149
Yeah, you're going to be paying for quality.

2230
01:54:49,789 --> 01:54:51,579
It's not shitty quality.

2231
01:54:53,399 --> 01:54:54,760
Going to staff center for supplies.

2232
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:56,039
Okay, I think I have the staff center.

2233
01:54:56,039 --> 01:54:57,960
All right, I need one more exhibit before I open the zoo.

2234
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:02,119
And it's going to be something that I can handle it.

2235
01:55:02,119 --> 01:55:05,210
How about one beluga?

2236
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:06,880
No.

2237
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,680
A whale.

2238
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:08,479
A huge whale.

2239
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,520
Orca.

2240
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:15,720
A giant warthog.

2241
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:21,680
I don't know.

2242
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:24,359
Should I make a beluga whale?

2243
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:33,239
What the hell?

2244
01:55:33,319 --> 01:55:34,119
Cave lion.

2245
01:55:35,079 --> 01:55:36,199
Komodo dragon.

2246
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:42,060
Gigantopithecus.

2247
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:44,380
What?

2248
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:52,939
What about...

2249
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:59,359
I mean, I kind of want to do the gigantopithecus.

2250
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,520
This thing...

2251
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:07,560
This is huge.

2252
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:08,359
60 grand.

2253
01:56:08,359 --> 01:56:08,760
All right.

2254
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:09,720
What biome does it need?

2255
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:11,880
Tropical rainforest.

2256
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:16,090
So let's do...

2257
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:17,770
Let's get the area secure.

2258
01:56:18,409 --> 01:56:21,239
Okay.

2259
01:56:21,239 --> 01:56:27,239
What does he eat?

2260
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:39,710
Okay.

2261
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:46,829
He needs a better habitat.

2262
01:56:47,789 --> 01:56:48,750
He needs a habitat.

2263
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,529
He eats beavers.

2264
01:56:51,529 --> 01:56:52,090
What do you eat?

2265
01:56:52,729 --> 01:56:53,770
He's extinct.

2266
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:54,409
He's...

2267
01:56:54,409 --> 01:56:55,050
I'm bringing it...

2268
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,170
Look, I'm bringing him back.

2269
01:56:58,840 --> 01:56:59,479
No, he eats...

2270
01:57:00,439 --> 01:57:00,920
Lurbo.

2271
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,520
Dinosaur meat.

2272
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:06,909
Shrimp.

2273
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:10,319
He's got a lot of options here.

2274
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:12,800
Hollow log with...

2275
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,960
Look, I'm just getting one of those dog toys

2276
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:16,239
and filling it with different foods.

2277
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:17,199
And peanut butter and stuff.

2278
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:20,840
He's...

2279
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:22,199
It's really hard for him to do.

2280
01:57:22,199 --> 01:57:23,560
And he's sticking his tongue in there like,

2281
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:24,279
I can't get it.

2282
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:28,189
All right.

2283
01:57:28,189 --> 01:57:29,470
So he eats fish.

2284
01:57:30,029 --> 01:57:35,180
Let's go ahead and get him in there.

2285
01:57:36,189 --> 01:57:39,579
Pause the game though.

2286
01:57:39,579 --> 01:57:40,300
Holy shit.

2287
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:41,420
He's huge.

2288
01:57:42,489 --> 01:57:42,810
All right.

2289
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:47,100
So we need roots.

2290
01:57:47,979 --> 01:57:48,619
Food dish.

2291
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:52,220
Bamboo.

2292
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:52,939
Is this what you eat?

2293
01:57:53,579 --> 01:57:59,050
What happened to like the dinosaur head?

2294
01:57:59,050 --> 01:57:59,930
Squeaky toy.

2295
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:11,039
Okay.

2296
01:58:12,699 --> 01:58:13,979
He's an artist.

2297
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:17,630
A feeder ball.

2298
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:18,109
Okay.

2299
01:58:18,109 --> 01:58:18,750
Feeder ball.

2300
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:21,920
Squeaky toys.

2301
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:27,260
Habitat.

2302
01:58:27,979 --> 01:58:28,779
Shade structure.

2303
01:58:30,199 --> 01:58:31,000
Rock shelter.

2304
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,930
Or a lion top of...

2305
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:36,409
This is big.

2306
01:58:36,409 --> 01:58:37,289
What about this?

2307
01:58:37,289 --> 01:58:38,170
Here we go.

2308
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:47,560
I wish I could put it here.

2309
01:58:57,789 --> 01:58:59,390
Only let him have the easel?

2310
01:58:59,390 --> 01:59:00,829
Oh, this is what it's gonna have to do.

2311
01:59:01,710 --> 01:59:02,430
No, wait, hold on.

2312
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:07,079
That's gonna have to do for now.

2313
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:07,960
I can expand later.

2314
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:11,260
Food.

2315
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,859
We're gonna put branches over here.

2316
01:59:13,659 --> 01:59:16,239
We'll put some food dish.

2317
01:59:21,149 --> 01:59:23,630
Let's put some yummy leaves.

2318
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:25,819
Okay.

2319
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:29,979
Let's give him some little trees.

2320
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:33,920
All right.

2321
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:34,399
Looks good.

2322
01:59:34,399 --> 01:59:35,279
Let's give him a rock.

2323
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:36,829
Oh!

2324
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:37,710
Okay.

2325
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:38,670
I thought I just killed him.

2326
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:41,600
That scared the shit out of me for some reason.

2327
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:41,840
All right.

2328
01:59:42,399 --> 01:59:46,279
Okay.

2329
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:48,039
So now he needs a...

2330
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:52,220
We need this...

2331
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:53,899
What is it?

2332
01:59:53,899 --> 01:59:54,460
What does he need?

2333
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:55,020
The tundra?

2334
01:59:55,979 --> 01:59:56,779
Family tree.

2335
01:59:57,899 --> 01:59:59,800
Wait, they're gonna have babies?

2336
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,039
All right.

2337
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:02,520
I need...

2338
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:03,159
What does he need?

2339
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,079
What biome?

2340
02:00:05,079 --> 02:00:09,560
I forget what the hell it was.

2341
02:00:11,289 --> 02:00:12,489
Or it was tropical rainforest.

2342
02:00:12,489 --> 02:00:13,369
There it is.

2343
02:00:13,369 --> 02:00:14,170
All right.

2344
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:15,130
Let's go with this.

2345
02:00:16,890 --> 02:00:19,020
What the fuck?

2346
02:00:19,819 --> 02:00:32,439
Let's get...

2347
02:00:32,439 --> 02:00:33,880
I can put a few of these trees in here.

2348
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:34,359
Just...

2349
02:00:34,359 --> 02:00:35,399
Actually, this is elevated now.

2350
02:00:35,399 --> 02:00:36,119
Let's go up here.

2351
02:00:37,319 --> 02:00:38,359
Actually, he should be happy.

2352
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:39,720
I'd be happy.

2353
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,970
Put him in like the golden seeds.

2354
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:44,329
I think he...

2355
02:00:44,329 --> 02:00:44,729
Okay.

2356
02:00:44,729 --> 02:00:45,930
So let's see how that happens.

2357
02:00:45,930 --> 02:00:47,529
So let's get the exhibit out.

2358
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:51,449
I need to put a entrance here.

2359
02:00:54,510 --> 02:00:54,989
Right here.

2360
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:56,430
Actually, let's put it...

2361
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:56,670
Yeah.

2362
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:57,630
Right there.

2363
02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:00,460
All right.

2364
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:05,260
I've got my first giganthosaurus.

2365
02:01:05,819 --> 02:01:11,390
I'm gonna think of a good name.

2366
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:12,270
Is he ready to paint?

2367
02:01:12,989 --> 02:01:15,159
Who's a painter's name?

2368
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,840
Michelangelo?

2369
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:18,479
Picasso?

2370
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:22,539
How about Bigasso?

2371
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:25,340
Because he's big.

2372
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:26,779
Bigasco.

2373
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:39,020
Okay.

2374
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:42,890
He's unable to reach the leaves.

2375
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:44,409
Maybe too close to another object.

2376
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:50,539
Beaver is pregnant?

2377
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:52,300
Where?

2378
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:54,239
Who's pregnant?

2379
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:01,760
Oh, this is...

2380
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:17,359
He's like, oh, wow.

2381
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:18,560
I got a good view of that.

2382
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:23,500
What are these?

2383
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:25,420
What are these fishes?

2384
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,380
Where did they come from?

2385
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:27,739
Why are you so angry?

2386
02:02:27,739 --> 02:02:29,659
Going to pee.

2387
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:37,000
You're not gonna go pee in somebody's food, are you?

2388
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:45,529
What food bowl is he about to piss in?

2389
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:59,000
Oh, there he goes.

2390
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,960
Peeing on dirt.

2391
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,979
Okay.

2392
02:03:01,979 --> 02:03:02,859
Good pee.

2393
02:03:02,859 --> 02:03:04,220
What the hell is this?

2394
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:06,140
They made their own beaver lodge.

2395
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:07,579
I didn't do this, did I?

2396
02:03:07,579 --> 02:03:08,220
Who's in there?

2397
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:11,260
Resting in the beaver lodge.

2398
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:12,220
They just made this.

2399
02:03:12,939 --> 02:03:20,250
I want to go in there.

2400
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:33,439
Am I allowed in here?

2401
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:40,409
American Beaver 3 is pregnant.

2402
02:03:40,409 --> 02:03:41,930
They're just having sex with each other in here.

2403
02:03:42,489 --> 02:03:44,560
This is...

2404
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,000
Okay, this is kind of like not good.

2405
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:54,439
Replenish.

2406
02:03:54,439 --> 02:04:05,180
That's a VR game quality.

2407
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:05,819
All right, we're good.

2408
02:04:09,819 --> 02:04:10,140
Yep.

2409
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:13,439
These two just create...

2410
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,760
They're creating babies over here.

2411
02:04:16,399 --> 02:04:17,680
I'm going to have to keep expanding this.

2412
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:18,960
They're just going to keep having sex with each other.

2413
02:04:20,239 --> 02:04:21,760
And they're going to keep having babies.

2414
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,119
I'm going to have to keep expanding this.

2415
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:30,109
The bark isn't even open yet.

2416
02:04:30,109 --> 02:04:31,229
Well, how's my other guy doing?

2417
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:38,300
I was like, why is he not here?

2418
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,300
Going to pee.

2419
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:45,199
Squeaky toy.

2420
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:47,199
Where's he going to pee?

2421
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:49,279
He's going to piss on the easel and make art.

2422
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:52,079
Let's visit him.

2423
02:04:58,090 --> 02:04:58,810
Whoa, easy.

2424
02:04:59,369 --> 02:05:02,119
I want to groom him.

2425
02:05:02,119 --> 02:05:02,840
How do I groom him?

2426
02:05:03,479 --> 02:05:07,039
He's getting antsy.

2427
02:05:07,039 --> 02:05:07,680
I don't like this.

2428
02:05:11,659 --> 02:05:12,619
No, he's happy.

2429
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:15,680
Look how happy.

2430
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:16,000
50!

2431
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,520
Look, he's like, I can lift so much weight.

2432
02:05:20,090 --> 02:05:20,810
All right, well, you're good.

2433
02:05:21,529 --> 02:05:23,920
Currently sitting.

2434
02:05:27,149 --> 02:05:27,789
Draw something.

2435
02:05:27,789 --> 02:05:28,909
All right, I need to...

2436
02:05:28,909 --> 02:05:30,109
It's time to open the park.

2437
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:32,109
Wait, I need an education stand and a donation machine.

2438
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:44,939
Educator platform can go here.

2439
02:05:50,010 --> 02:05:51,130
We need another educator.

2440
02:05:56,619 --> 02:05:59,340
And I need some donation machines as well.

2441
02:05:59,979 --> 02:06:03,529
Donation box.

2442
02:06:03,529 --> 02:06:04,090
Go ahead.

2443
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,640
Right in front.

2444
02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:12,109
I think it's time to actually open this place.

2445
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:14,890
I'm going to save it.

2446
02:06:16,109 --> 02:06:17,149
Another beaver is pregnant.

2447
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:21,899
Save game.

2448
02:06:32,079 --> 02:06:33,279
All right, beavers and big guys.

2449
02:06:40,319 --> 02:06:42,460
All right, it's time to open the park.

2450
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:43,899
Wait, I need a toilet.

2451
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:46,439
I need a bathroom.

2452
02:06:46,439 --> 02:06:47,319
It's really important.

2453
02:06:50,909 --> 02:06:54,270
Uh, let's do family restroom.

2454
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:57,960
This is huge.

2455
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:10,489
All right, good enough.

2456
02:07:10,489 --> 02:07:14,250
It's a couple's restroom?

2457
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:14,569
What?

2458
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:18,189
All right, what's wrong with the leaves?

2459
02:07:18,829 --> 02:07:27,689
You apparently can't reach these leaves because they're too high.

2460
02:07:27,689 --> 02:07:27,930
Okay.

2461
02:07:28,569 --> 02:07:32,159
Well, then let's make that terrain better then.

2462
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:44,140
I need to lower the ground.

2463
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:48,439
I may have just fucked it all up.

2464
02:07:48,439 --> 02:07:49,000
Whatever.

2465
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:49,640
Open the park.

2466
02:07:52,779 --> 02:07:54,619
The park is now officially...

2467
02:08:14,649 --> 02:08:15,210
Let's go!

2468
02:08:15,210 --> 02:08:16,250
Rack in the money.

2469
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:27,119
I can't wait to see some animals.

2470
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:28,399
Beaver and butt head.

2471
02:08:34,159 --> 02:08:34,960
One person.

2472
02:08:36,329 --> 02:08:39,210
After months and months in development.

2473
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:41,710
One, one guy.

2474
02:08:42,270 --> 02:08:46,220
Well, I hope you enjoy yourself.

2475
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:47,260
Get to work.

2476
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:50,090
The first guess, you've been training for so long.

2477
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,159
For this exact moment right here.

2478
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:56,000
And you're missing your opportunity.

2479
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,319
Where's it going?

2480
02:09:00,319 --> 02:09:01,359
We're going to follow this guy around.

2481
02:09:05,149 --> 02:09:05,789
No ATM.

2482
02:09:05,789 --> 02:09:06,670
Skip the ATM.

2483
02:09:08,079 --> 02:09:09,760
Skipping the donation machine.

2484
02:09:13,479 --> 02:09:13,880
Okay.

2485
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:22,199
I think this person is so dehydrated and foodless at this point.

2486
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:28,649
Ooh, I like seeing animal American beaver 13 eat from the substrate pile.

2487
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:34,250
It's neat seeing American beaver 2 resting in the beaver lodge.

2488
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:37,130
I can't wait to see some more animals.

2489
02:09:37,130 --> 02:09:37,770
Wait, track him.

2490
02:09:43,529 --> 02:09:44,090
He likes it.

2491
02:09:48,319 --> 02:09:49,279
Kimmy is high.

2492
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:51,119
Well, we got another guest.

2493
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:57,100
See, this guy just tweeted out that he was here and how fun it was.

2494
02:09:57,659 --> 02:09:59,579
And his five followers just said it to come.

2495
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:06,489
I can't wait to what people have to say about...

2496
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:15,680
Is nobody going to get on that ride?

2497
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:19,600
I want someone to get...

2498
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,119
How do I get them on the ride?

2499
02:10:24,989 --> 02:10:25,789
Is it possible?

2500
02:10:29,069 --> 02:10:30,029
At least they're happy.

2501
02:10:30,029 --> 02:10:31,069
I need like benches.

2502
02:10:32,029 --> 02:10:33,149
I need a place to sit down.

2503
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:39,880
American beaver 4 is about to give birth.

2504
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:45,550
Come on, come on, this is first time.

2505
02:10:46,109 --> 02:11:00,119
This is my first ever time that I'm going to...

2506
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:16,359
I got it.

2507
02:11:16,359 --> 02:11:17,720
Oh, now there's not enough space.

2508
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:19,239
I have...

2509
02:11:19,239 --> 02:11:20,199
There's not enough space.

2510
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,760
More space.

2511
02:11:28,909 --> 02:11:31,710
Many animals don't have enough space because they're a beaver

2512
02:11:31,710 --> 02:11:34,270
and they're inside of this giant beaver enclosure.

2513
02:11:35,069 --> 02:11:35,869
Another birth.

2514
02:11:35,869 --> 02:11:37,390
Oh, god damn it.

2515
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:41,500
I can stay on top of this.

2516
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:53,680
What the fuck's going on here?

2517
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:55,760
Here comes another one.

2518
02:11:56,319 --> 02:12:02,180
Okay.

2519
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:09,420
Here comes the magic of birth.

2520
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:31,260
More space.

2521
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:38,890
No, the park is open.

2522
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:40,329
The park is currently open.

2523
02:12:40,329 --> 02:12:40,829
Hold on.

2524
02:12:47,119 --> 02:12:48,079
Set them all free.

2525
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:50,079
No, I'm not going to set them all free.

2526
02:12:50,079 --> 02:12:51,199
Free.

2527
02:12:51,899 --> 02:13:11,689
Now, no one can even walk in the park.

2528
02:13:11,689 --> 02:13:18,189
There needs to be a path that now leads up here

2529
02:13:18,829 --> 02:13:19,630
and then around...

2530
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:20,989
I got to level this whole thing.

2531
02:13:21,710 --> 02:13:32,220
Hold on, let me...

2532
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:40,060
I'm making sure that I'm going to future proof

2533
02:13:42,539 --> 02:13:44,140
this whole exhibit here.

2534
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:49,739
Oh, fuck.

2535
02:13:55,359 --> 02:14:02,079
Uh, sorry about that, guys.

2536
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:12,159
I'll fix this, don't worry.

2537
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:20,600
Those guys just drove around in a circle until they were evaporated.

2538
02:14:21,319 --> 02:14:28,039
And now, this is going to come out all the way to here,

2539
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:30,000
right there,

2540
02:14:30,699 --> 02:14:31,500
and then up here.

2541
02:14:32,060 --> 02:14:38,329
It's like this.

2542
02:14:39,130 --> 02:14:44,670
Look at how much more space this is going to be.

2543
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,279
Down here, the path is going to go around

2544
02:14:50,079 --> 02:14:55,119
to make sure this doesn't happen for like another at least 30 minutes.

2545
02:14:56,319 --> 02:14:56,880
That's done.

2546
02:14:59,869 --> 02:15:04,569
No one even...

2547
02:15:04,569 --> 02:15:06,250
No, people are going to walk in this park

2548
02:15:06,250 --> 02:15:09,050
and say, well, the beaver exhibit is stupid, and they leave.

2549
02:15:09,689 --> 02:15:10,649
A little do they know

2550
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:13,710
that I have an extinct animal up here

2551
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:16,270
that is wildly intelligent.

2552
02:15:16,270 --> 02:15:17,390
He can paint paintings.

2553
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:21,520
Sell some beavers.

2554
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:22,020
I can't.

2555
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,399
They just have to put them up for adoption.

2556
02:15:25,119 --> 02:15:26,239
See?

2557
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:33,390
Big Osco has no water.

2558
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:40,460
Well, I'll get to that in a second.

2559
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:43,760
I'll get to that in just a second.

2560
02:15:44,319 --> 02:15:46,670
All right, we need not tropical rainforest.

2561
02:15:46,670 --> 02:15:52,699
We need wetlands.

2562
02:15:52,699 --> 02:15:53,819
Take the trees off.

2563
02:15:53,819 --> 02:15:55,500
Uh, I'm okay with a little bit of rocks.

2564
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:06,270
Now, I can expand the water a little bit.

2565
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:07,630
Actually, let's have a nice little, uh,

2566
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:10,109
little spot for them to go like up here.

2567
02:16:10,989 --> 02:16:16,039
Yeah, so that looks good.

2568
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:18,409
Maybe a little bit deeper.

2569
02:16:19,770 --> 02:16:22,239
Give them some more room.

2570
02:16:25,399 --> 02:16:25,899
All right.

2571
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:27,100
Okay.

2572
02:16:29,239 --> 02:16:29,739
All right.

2573
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:36,219
Now, there's no problem.

2574
02:16:36,219 --> 02:16:37,180
We just need to put a...

2575
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:40,959
Put crocodiles in there.

2576
02:16:44,159 --> 02:16:44,799
What?

2577
02:16:44,799 --> 02:16:46,959
Will a crocodile eat a beaver

2578
02:16:48,059 --> 02:16:50,379
in the same amount of time it takes for a beaver to come out of

2579
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:51,899
a conception?

2580
02:16:51,899 --> 02:16:52,299
You know what I mean?

2581
02:16:52,299 --> 02:16:54,219
Like, to be conceived.

2582
02:16:54,219 --> 02:16:56,620
To be birthed, born.

2583
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:58,120
Is that going to be the same?

2584
02:16:58,680 --> 02:16:59,559
Probably not.

2585
02:16:59,559 --> 02:17:05,280
Okay, so let's get...

2586
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:07,760
I need the entrance.

2587
02:17:10,459 --> 02:17:11,500
So, we need one here.

2588
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:13,420
We need one up here.

2589
02:17:15,229 --> 02:17:15,950
All righty, let's go.

2590
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:18,600
Oh, shit.

2591
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:19,319
You have to be out here.

2592
02:17:19,879 --> 02:17:21,049
I need to move this.

2593
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:25,610
You need to move this.

2594
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:30,600
I need fucking a road.

2595
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:35,129
Not contained.

2596
02:17:35,129 --> 02:17:36,729
How is American Beaver 4 not contained?

2597
02:17:37,530 --> 02:17:39,690
Yes, you are.

2598
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:42,059
They're all happy.

2599
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:45,639
They can't get to the ape.

2600
02:17:45,639 --> 02:17:46,139
Wait.

2601
02:17:46,680 --> 02:18:07,959
Now they can.

2602
02:18:19,319 --> 02:18:20,440
I need an elevated path.

2603
02:18:21,159 --> 02:18:25,399
I wonder if I can...

2604
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,829
Okay, they can make it.

2605
02:18:33,389 --> 02:18:34,350
Just need to get rid of this.

2606
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
It looks a little ugly, but I'll fix it later.

2607
02:18:50,510 --> 02:18:51,069
More birth.

2608
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:55,360
I don't think I can possibly get up here.

2609
02:18:56,399 --> 02:18:57,520
I need to make an elevated path.

2610
02:18:59,959 --> 02:19:01,239
Stone elevated path.

2611
02:19:01,239 --> 02:19:02,920
Okay, so we're gonna go right here.

2612
02:19:03,559 --> 02:19:11,559
And then this is gonna ramp down.

2613
02:19:11,559 --> 02:19:13,159
This is gonna be down, yeah, like that.

2614
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:16,010
And then that leads to here.

2615
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:27,979
All right.

2616
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:29,280
We're good.

2617
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:31,659
They can make it up here.

2618
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:36,329
Oh, you dummy.

2619
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:41,479
I need to really get in there.

2620
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:58,600
The park is still open, isn't it?

2621
02:20:01,739 --> 02:20:03,659
Just make the bridge go over the beavers.

2622
02:20:03,659 --> 02:20:04,940
I mean, I was thinking about that.

2623
02:20:05,899 --> 02:20:09,770
It's a pretty good idea.

2624
02:20:14,319 --> 02:20:17,239
Okay, that looks good.

2625
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:18,909
It's probably good.

2626
02:20:18,909 --> 02:20:20,030
I mean, not good at all.

2627
02:20:21,950 --> 02:20:22,879
It's all right.

2628
02:20:22,879 --> 02:20:23,360
That looks...

2629
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:23,760
Look at that.

2630
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:24,239
That's fine.

2631
02:20:24,959 --> 02:20:28,569
I'm just gonna fix this one later.

2632
02:20:28,569 --> 02:20:32,120
How are we doing?

2633
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:32,520
We got any...

2634
02:20:34,239 --> 02:20:35,920
I don't like this zoo.

2635
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:37,040
It's time for me to go home.

2636
02:20:37,600 --> 02:21:00,030
I don't think he's...

2637
02:21:00,030 --> 02:21:01,149
I don't think he's aggressive.

2638
02:21:01,149 --> 02:21:02,270
He just thinks it's funny.

2639
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:06,799
He's just laughing.

2640
02:21:10,190 --> 02:21:11,950
Whoa, no way.

2641
02:21:11,950 --> 02:21:12,190
What?

2642
02:21:13,469 --> 02:21:14,270
What are you doing?

2643
02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:17,049
No, you're fired.

2644
02:21:17,049 --> 02:21:29,120
All right.

2645
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:30,639
Hey, how do I make you happy?

2646
02:21:30,639 --> 02:21:31,680
I need to give him water.

2647
02:21:53,530 --> 02:21:54,329
I can't.

2648
02:21:54,329 --> 02:21:55,209
Whatever.

2649
02:21:55,209 --> 02:21:56,649
I'm not even gonna say anything.

2650
02:21:57,209 --> 02:21:59,690
Look at this painting.

2651
02:21:59,690 --> 02:22:01,370
Oh, that looks like shit.

2652
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:04,920
What happened to the kid?

2653
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:08,860
Where'd the guest go?

2654
02:22:21,149 --> 02:22:23,770
All right.

2655
02:22:23,770 --> 02:22:24,729
I gotta get back to this.

2656
02:22:26,379 --> 02:22:27,260
Tied.

2657
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:29,659
No, we just gave him a little tap on the face.

2658
02:22:29,659 --> 02:22:32,989
And look at me, racking in mad dough over here.

2659
02:22:35,209 --> 02:22:36,319
Angry.

2660
02:22:36,319 --> 02:22:38,239
I think coffee drink one is overpriced.

2661
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:38,719
Oh, action.

2662
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:48,909
Fucking shot him.

2663
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:55,420
It's...

2664
02:22:55,420 --> 02:22:57,899
Oh, I really need to use the bathroom.

2665
02:22:57,899 --> 02:22:59,420
I'm upset at the lack of trash cans.

2666
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:00,299
I hope hot...

2667
02:23:00,299 --> 02:23:01,819
I hope dog hot...

2668
02:23:01,819 --> 02:23:03,819
I hope hot dog food stand.

2669
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:06,860
Guests would like a place to sit.

2670
02:23:09,709 --> 02:23:11,549
Hey, littering?

2671
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:13,629
You're gonna litter at my park?

2672
02:23:14,270 --> 02:23:16,360
This area smells.

2673
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,280
He's just like, that is funny.

2674
02:23:53,469 --> 02:23:54,829
People are screaming.

2675
02:23:54,829 --> 02:23:59,239
I want to get over there.

2676
02:23:59,239 --> 02:24:02,079
He hasn't done anything wrong.

2677
02:24:09,790 --> 02:24:13,479
He's just listening to what she's saying.

2678
02:24:13,479 --> 02:24:14,520
He's very entertained.

2679
02:24:15,159 --> 02:24:19,170
Uh-oh.

2680
02:24:25,799 --> 02:24:27,159
He doesn't like this person.

2681
02:24:27,799 --> 02:24:30,059
I don't know why.

2682
02:24:30,059 --> 02:24:39,579
He just wants to eat leaves.

2683
02:24:40,219 --> 02:24:44,280
I wonder...

2684
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:46,030
All right, let's let her out of here.

2685
02:24:46,590 --> 02:25:00,440
Well, he really doesn't care at all.

2686
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:01,879
Help.

2687
02:25:01,879 --> 02:25:05,610
Big Asko is chasing me.

2688
02:25:05,610 --> 02:25:08,090
Well, that's not real.

2689
02:25:08,090 --> 02:25:09,610
He's chasing me.

2690
02:25:09,610 --> 02:25:19,659
All right, you're fine.

2691
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:24,860
It was a fake Yelp complaint.

2692
02:25:31,479 --> 02:25:32,760
He needs food.

2693
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:34,649
He doesn't have any food left?

2694
02:25:34,649 --> 02:25:38,459
What's he doing?

2695
02:25:38,459 --> 02:25:46,200
What happened?

2696
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:46,760
What's wrong with him?

2697
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:47,479
What happened?

2698
02:25:47,479 --> 02:25:49,549
Oh, he's just sleeping.

2699
02:25:49,549 --> 02:25:50,360
Okay.

2700
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:51,799
Uh, let's get some food in here for you.

2701
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:56,590
How about like a bowl of leaves?

2702
02:25:57,309 --> 02:26:00,100
Here.

2703
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:02,260
There.

2704
02:26:03,659 --> 02:26:04,620
Now you can eat.

2705
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:05,659
And yet you've got water.

2706
02:26:05,659 --> 02:26:06,379
There's water here.

2707
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,120
There's still water in there.

2708
02:26:10,979 --> 02:26:11,700
Yeah, he's fine.

2709
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:12,420
What are you talking about?

2710
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:18,340
So now this is how you get reviews.

2711
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:19,940
This is how you get attention to your park.

2712
02:26:21,709 --> 02:26:23,549
Everybody's reading in the newspaper about

2713
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:26,139
the guy that got pushed over

2714
02:26:26,139 --> 02:26:27,260
and the lady that was screaming.

2715
02:26:27,260 --> 02:26:29,260
And now everyone just needs to come see for themselves.

2716
02:26:30,750 --> 02:26:31,250
Marketing.

2717
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:32,530
One-on-one.

2718
02:26:32,989 --> 02:26:39,200
All right, how about even with the, uh, beavers?

2719
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:42,829
The beavers in attraction?

2720
02:26:43,469 --> 02:26:44,590
Yeah, people like the beavers.

2721
02:26:45,229 --> 02:26:47,940
Seems to be going pretty well.

2722
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:53,469
Uh, how do I get rid of this fucking thing?

2723
02:26:53,469 --> 02:26:54,270
I'm not going to use it.

2724
02:26:54,909 --> 02:27:10,700
All right, what's the next attraction?

2725
02:27:11,819 --> 02:27:13,100
People need to be able to get up there first.

2726
02:27:15,229 --> 02:27:17,069
I guarantee I turn a profit this next month.

2727
02:27:18,030 --> 02:27:21,680
All right, the track is gone.

2728
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:24,959
It's just an annoyance.

2729
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:28,450
Let's get some benches.

2730
02:27:29,409 --> 02:27:32,030
So bench.

2731
02:27:32,670 --> 02:27:33,309
Just sit it.

2732
02:27:34,510 --> 02:27:38,909
We need to make these a little wider.

2733
02:27:39,709 --> 02:27:45,889
And the food court.

2734
02:27:45,889 --> 02:27:46,930
There's got to be some benches.

2735
02:27:47,889 --> 02:27:52,959
Why are you so angry about?

2736
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:53,459
Relax.

2737
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:57,750
I don't have a place to sit down and drink my tea.

2738
02:27:58,629 --> 02:27:59,829
Uh, I need trash bins.

2739
02:28:00,629 --> 02:28:08,280
All right.

2740
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:10,799
Finally, people can throw their trash away.

2741
02:28:10,799 --> 02:28:12,479
It's been like two hours.

2742
02:28:17,670 --> 02:28:19,750
American beaver 13 is really thirsty.

2743
02:28:19,750 --> 02:28:21,590
American beaver 5 is unable to reach the hollow log.

2744
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:31,409
Just drink water.

2745
02:28:32,049 --> 02:28:33,719
There's running water right here.

2746
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:43,000
Just just drink water.

2747
02:28:43,719 --> 02:28:46,440
All right, I need to refill.

2748
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:47,319
Now this is full.

2749
02:28:47,959 --> 02:28:51,159
Is there really one water dish?

2750
02:28:51,159 --> 02:28:58,180
Nobody needs it fulfilled.

2751
02:28:59,139 --> 02:29:00,340
This is the only one.

2752
02:29:01,059 --> 02:29:05,219
Everyone's drinking out of the same water dish.

2753
02:29:05,860 --> 02:29:08,959
Oh, for the love of God.

2754
02:29:08,959 --> 02:29:09,680
Okay, hold on.

2755
02:29:13,090 --> 02:29:13,809
I didn't know that.

2756
02:29:14,450 --> 02:29:16,129
I thought they just went underwater and just went.

2757
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:22,479
He's gonna fill it.

2758
02:29:22,479 --> 02:29:23,680
I need like a bunch of these.

2759
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:24,399
I need them over here.

2760
02:29:30,979 --> 02:29:33,479
Uh, food dish with water.

2761
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:36,600
Put it next to the foods.

2762
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:37,559
I don't have to go that far.

2763
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:42,450
That looks good.

2764
02:29:44,850 --> 02:29:45,250
All right.

2765
02:29:45,809 --> 02:29:46,850
How we doing with money?

2766
02:29:57,719 --> 02:30:01,239
Whatever.

2767
02:30:01,239 --> 02:30:04,360
$175 for a tuna can with water in it.

2768
02:30:04,360 --> 02:30:08,680
Yeah, all they're doing guys is the zookeepers are going over here and

2769
02:30:09,319 --> 02:30:11,959
dumping the dish in there and just putting it over there.

2770
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:16,120
That's $175 middleman.

2771
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:23,379
All right, let's go see how he's doing.

2772
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:25,379
Your needs are good.

2773
02:30:27,090 --> 02:30:27,889
Not that thirsty.

2774
02:30:27,889 --> 02:30:28,690
Everything's good to go.

2775
02:30:29,569 --> 02:30:37,409
All right, I think it's time to add onto the zoo.

2776
02:30:38,129 --> 02:30:42,450
The next thing is going to be a water exhibit over here.

2777
02:30:43,170 --> 02:30:46,280
After another, I need another bathroom.

2778
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:52,469
Family restroom right here.

2779
02:30:53,350 --> 02:30:55,620
And then take a path up this way.

2780
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,520
And this is our first water exhibit.

2781
02:30:58,520 --> 02:30:59,559
It's going to be right here.

2782
02:30:59,559 --> 02:31:02,360
It's going to be like five killer whales.

2783
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:09,909
Let's see what we need.

2784
02:31:09,909 --> 02:31:11,030
What kind of habitat do you need?

2785
02:31:16,879 --> 02:31:18,159
Can perform in shows.

2786
02:31:18,959 --> 02:31:22,479
We should get a flavor bird exhibit.

2787
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:25,440
No, that's not bad.

2788
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:26,159
That's not a bad idea.

2789
02:31:32,579 --> 02:31:39,670
Just like a stegosaurus, manatee, mastodon.

2790
02:31:40,469 --> 02:31:45,809
I mean, that's kind of a flavor bird right there.

2791
02:31:45,809 --> 02:31:47,170
No, that's the real flavor bird.

2792
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:52,739
I want a water exhibit though.

2793
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:57,159
Whale shark.

2794
02:31:57,799 --> 02:32:00,079
That's the biggest shark in the world, right?

2795
02:32:00,079 --> 02:32:00,879
Yeah.

2796
02:32:00,879 --> 02:32:02,469
I want a whale shark exhibit.

2797
02:32:03,030 --> 02:32:13,670
Maybe some sort of water dinosaur.

2798
02:32:14,229 --> 02:32:17,000
Tyrannosaurus rex.

2799
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,120
This is so huge.

2800
02:32:20,309 --> 02:32:21,590
I kind of need this though.

2801
02:32:22,229 --> 02:32:24,530
The t-rex is going to be over here.

2802
02:32:24,530 --> 02:32:24,850
Up.

2803
02:32:24,850 --> 02:32:26,129
You have to go all the way up to see him.

2804
02:32:26,770 --> 02:32:28,549
What a brilliant strategy that is.

2805
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:36,559
I like that strategy a lot.

2806
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:38,319
I became famous.

2807
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:44,920
Did it.

2808
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:46,799
All right.

2809
02:32:46,799 --> 02:32:47,360
We need to do.

2810
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:50,000
I'm going to do like two t-rexes up here.

2811
02:32:50,559 --> 02:32:52,159
This whole entire area.

2812
02:32:52,799 --> 02:32:55,040
The whole viewing angle is going to be from right here.

2813
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,120
We're going to have two t-rexes up here.

2814
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:06,020
So you can either go up to the t-rex or right to the gosko.

2815
02:33:06,579 --> 02:33:11,399
So let's start with this down here.

2816
02:33:11,399 --> 02:33:17,000
Because it kind of needs to be like this.

2817
02:33:17,719 --> 02:33:19,079
Well, that didn't fucking do anything.

2818
02:33:19,879 --> 02:33:23,479
I think I'm going to have to go from here.

2819
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:27,399
Hmm.

2820
02:33:31,090 --> 02:33:31,489
No.

2821
02:33:31,489 --> 02:33:32,049
Not quite.

2822
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:38,370
What about the manatee exhibit?

2823
02:33:38,370 --> 02:33:39,170
No, don't worry.

2824
02:33:39,170 --> 02:33:39,649
I'll get it.

2825
02:33:40,530 --> 02:33:46,719
Really.

2826
02:33:46,719 --> 02:33:47,840
How do I level this whole thing?

2827
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:50,600
Can I like level this place?

2828
02:33:50,600 --> 02:33:51,719
Just fucking trash it.

2829
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:55,459
Just make it flat.

2830
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:00,920
Guest mode.

2831
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:01,479
Terrain.

2832
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:02,840
Editor.

2833
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:03,239
Here we go.

2834
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:05,559
Flattened terrain.

2835
02:34:05,559 --> 02:34:05,959
There it is.

2836
02:34:07,479 --> 02:34:20,360
I mean, I kind of fucked this.

2837
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:21,479
I don't even need this bridge.

2838
02:34:22,440 --> 02:34:25,280
This bridge makes no sense.

2839
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:25,520
No.

2840
02:34:26,159 --> 02:34:39,319
Kill that person for no reason.

2841
02:34:39,319 --> 02:34:39,559
Okay.

2842
02:34:39,559 --> 02:34:39,879
Here we go.

2843
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:42,399
Flattened terrain.

2844
02:34:45,329 --> 02:34:45,809
Flatten it.

2845
02:34:46,530 --> 02:35:01,489
You dick.

2846
02:35:02,209 --> 02:35:05,479
How did I?

2847
02:35:05,479 --> 02:35:07,079
I'm trying to flatten the terrain.

2848
02:35:07,079 --> 02:35:09,959
I'll just have to go like this.

2849
02:35:22,659 --> 02:35:23,459
Oh.

2850
02:35:23,459 --> 02:35:27,170
Oh, fuck.

2851
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:28,290
What have I done?

2852
02:35:28,290 --> 02:35:45,510
That's good.

2853
02:35:45,510 --> 02:35:51,239
Now I got to go back to here.

2854
02:35:51,239 --> 02:35:53,079
Where does this come out from?

2855
02:35:53,079 --> 02:35:56,680
No, this is not going to go up.

2856
02:35:56,680 --> 02:35:58,360
This has to go straight across.

2857
02:35:59,479 --> 02:36:10,920
And then down into right like here.

2858
02:36:11,719 --> 02:36:20,260
How much higher do you have to go?

2859
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:49,399
No.

2860
02:36:49,399 --> 02:36:50,840
This is not what I wanted.

2861
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:56,309
I'm going to go from here.

2862
02:36:56,309 --> 02:36:57,559
That makes most sense.

2863
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:04,899
Beaver's pregnant.

2864
02:37:05,540 --> 02:37:06,260
All right.

2865
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:09,760
That's good.

2866
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:21,430
Are you telling me I can't go forward from here?

2867
02:37:26,979 --> 02:37:30,959
That is so close that it's infuriating me.

2868
02:37:30,959 --> 02:37:32,239
How is that possible?

2869
02:37:32,239 --> 02:38:12,290
I got a better idea.

2870
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:13,649
Smooth this whole damn thing out.

2871
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:22,200
So now I can just go straight down.

2872
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:23,239
Right here.

2873
02:38:23,879 --> 02:38:27,250
Cross the earth onto your fist.

2874
02:38:29,909 --> 02:38:31,360
All right.

2875
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:32,639
Can we do this again?

2876
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:35,379
Guests need bathrooms.

2877
02:38:35,379 --> 02:38:37,459
Well, I'm trying to make a T-Rex exhibit.

2878
02:38:37,459 --> 02:38:40,020
So you're going to have to wait.

2879
02:38:40,020 --> 02:39:26,239
Here we go.

2880
02:39:26,239 --> 02:39:26,719
Got it.

2881
02:39:26,719 --> 02:39:27,280
All right.

2882
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:31,459
Now we just need a regular path.

2883
02:39:31,459 --> 02:39:40,559
Let's get some more viewing angle for the beavers until it splits.

2884
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:43,200
Which is going to split this way.

2885
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:47,700
Fuck you, game.

2886
02:39:48,340 --> 02:39:52,149
How do I get rid of you?

2887
02:39:52,149 --> 02:39:53,190
I can't get rid of you.

2888
02:39:53,909 --> 02:39:58,559
I try to flatten you and it don't work.

2889
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:05,799
Flatten.

2890
02:40:05,799 --> 02:40:11,239
Why is that one piece just sitting there?

2891
02:40:11,959 --> 02:40:15,079
Why are you doing this to me?

2892
02:40:25,459 --> 02:40:29,350
Dear Lord.

2893
02:40:30,229 --> 02:40:31,479
Oh, God.

2894
02:40:31,479 --> 02:40:32,360
Just keep it there.

2895
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:33,159
Who cares?

2896
02:40:33,799 --> 02:40:40,389
Oh, no, no, no.

2897
02:40:40,389 --> 02:40:41,590
Now they're going to get out.

2898
02:40:41,590 --> 02:40:43,889
Look, you thought about it.

2899
02:40:45,590 --> 02:40:45,909
Okay.

2900
02:40:47,219 --> 02:40:49,219
So now we have this entrance this way.

2901
02:40:49,219 --> 02:40:53,250
This goes up to the, uh, vagasco.

2902
02:40:53,250 --> 02:40:55,409
Now it's time to make the T-Rex inhabitant.

2903
02:40:57,799 --> 02:40:59,239
Inhabit, uh, yeah.

2904
02:40:59,239 --> 02:40:59,799
Okay.

2905
02:40:59,799 --> 02:41:02,469
This needs a path.

2906
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:04,899
Can I walk up this?

2907
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:06,819
Okay.

2908
02:41:06,819 --> 02:41:07,299
It works.

2909
02:41:10,790 --> 02:41:13,350
Good.

2910
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:14,069
Bath.

2911
02:41:14,149 --> 02:41:18,680
The path that needs to go.

2912
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:21,989
The hell?

2913
02:41:21,989 --> 02:41:22,709
Why is it green?

2914
02:41:23,350 --> 02:41:24,680
Why did I just lose it?

2915
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:25,639
I just lost a star.

2916
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:28,120
I just lost a star.

2917
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:28,520
For what?

2918
02:41:29,159 --> 02:41:31,860
Why did I lose it?

2919
02:41:31,860 --> 02:41:34,340
You can't lose accolades.

2920
02:41:36,799 --> 02:41:38,639
That's absolute dog shit.

2921
02:41:38,639 --> 02:41:38,879
All right.

2922
02:41:38,879 --> 02:41:39,200
Hold on.

2923
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:43,620
I guess they need more bathrooms, huh?

2924
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:43,940
Sure.

2925
02:41:43,940 --> 02:41:44,979
I'll make you more bathrooms.

2926
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:55,059
Is this what you want?

2927
02:41:55,059 --> 02:42:00,579
How many more do you need?

2928
02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:05,280
What's that?

2929
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:06,579
What are you guys doing over here?

2930
02:42:07,219 --> 02:42:10,370
Are people going and pissing in the bushes or like shitting in the woods?

2931
02:42:11,010 --> 02:42:13,889
Something is blocking the restroom.

2932
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:19,399
What is blocking?

2933
02:42:19,399 --> 02:42:20,440
What's blocking the restroom?

2934
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:29,360
All right.

2935
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:30,079
The beavers are fine.

2936
02:42:30,799 --> 02:42:31,680
Everyone's doing well.

2937
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:36,840
Guess it needs more bathrooms.

2938
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:39,379
Well, you're gonna have to settle for what's there for now.

2939
02:42:40,180 --> 02:42:41,190
All right.

2940
02:42:41,190 --> 02:42:41,750
We need...

2941
02:42:42,549 --> 02:43:02,920
This is huge.

2942
02:43:02,920 --> 02:43:04,200
Ah, that sucks.

2943
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:04,760
Wait a second.

2944
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:12,600
Have I tried pressing G?

2945
02:43:13,719 --> 02:43:22,319
This terrain is so fucked up.

2946
02:43:27,829 --> 02:43:28,629
Got water?

2947
02:43:28,629 --> 02:43:29,270
Yeah.

2948
02:43:29,270 --> 02:43:30,149
No, you're fine.

2949
02:43:30,870 --> 02:43:32,200
Everybody's fine.

2950
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:40,610
All right.

2951
02:43:40,610 --> 02:43:41,489
What does the T-Rex need?

2952
02:43:44,069 --> 02:43:49,360
T-Rex needs a tropical rainforest biome.

2953
02:43:49,360 --> 02:44:01,670
So tropical rainforest.

2954
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:10,319
Trees in here.

2955
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:12,469
That looks pretty nice.

2956
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:19,079
And a little shallow water right in the corner.

2957
02:44:19,639 --> 02:44:21,079
A little pool.

2958
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:25,360
American beaver six is pregnant again.

2959
02:44:28,239 --> 02:44:30,559
They're just having non-stop children in here.

2960
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:33,059
This is the...

2961
02:44:33,059 --> 02:44:34,579
How can I tell how much money this has made?

2962
02:44:35,139 --> 02:44:36,979
Is there a way for me to tell?

2963
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:39,829
How much money has the beaver attracted?

2964
02:44:39,829 --> 02:44:41,110
Was there even a donation machine here?

2965
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:47,120
Has this just been for free the whole fucking time?

2966
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:54,790
It has been.

2967
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:57,280
This has been free the entire time.

2968
02:45:01,639 --> 02:45:02,440
Unless I get that...

2969
02:45:03,079 --> 02:45:04,120
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2970
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:04,600
Never mind.

2971
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:05,959
We're doing just fine.

2972
02:45:05,959 --> 02:45:06,920
We're doing just fine.

2973
02:45:10,180 --> 02:45:13,940
American beaver has received 2,165.

2974
02:45:14,579 --> 02:45:20,600
Let's flatten this out.

2975
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:21,479
Make it look a little better.

2976
02:45:25,639 --> 02:45:27,000
Make a large viewing angle.

2977
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:30,840
Delete that.

2978
02:45:31,969 --> 02:45:32,610
See like that.

2979
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:34,049
Okay, so there's a lot of people that can be up here.

2980
02:45:34,049 --> 02:45:38,069
We need somebody to give tips on the T-Rex.

2981
02:45:38,709 --> 02:45:41,889
So we need a education kiosk.

2982
02:45:41,889 --> 02:45:45,219
Just did it right here.

2983
02:45:46,100 --> 02:45:53,110
Right here is fine, I think.

2984
02:45:53,750 --> 02:45:54,950
Let's get an educator.

2985
02:45:59,170 --> 02:46:00,850
And a donation box.

2986
02:46:01,649 --> 02:46:04,040
Because this is going to be worth...

2987
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:05,639
This is going to be a lot of money.

2988
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:09,379
So pay up.

2989
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:11,520
Seriously.

2990
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:15,479
All right.

2991
02:46:15,479 --> 02:46:22,020
So this is the walk up to the T-Rex exhibit.

2992
02:46:22,819 --> 02:46:23,540
Road splits.

2993
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:26,200
Here's the person to tell you all about T-Rex.

2994
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:27,239
Here's the donation machine.

2995
02:46:27,959 --> 02:46:31,270
So now I'm going to make sure there's like food in there.

2996
02:46:31,270 --> 02:46:31,909
All right, I can do that.

2997
02:46:31,909 --> 02:46:32,629
Okay.

2998
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:37,620
$80,000 for a T-Rex.

2999
02:46:40,790 --> 02:46:41,430
All right.

3000
02:46:41,430 --> 02:46:43,510
Carnivorous predatory dinosaur.

3001
02:46:43,510 --> 02:46:43,989
What do they eat?

3002
02:46:44,549 --> 02:46:47,219
What does a T-Rex eat?

3003
02:46:49,909 --> 02:46:52,549
Male and female.

3004
02:46:52,549 --> 02:46:56,639
Okay.

3005
02:46:56,639 --> 02:46:59,120
T-Rex eats meat.

3006
02:47:00,549 --> 02:47:01,989
Right, makes sense.

3007
02:47:01,989 --> 02:47:13,040
Something is blocking the meat.

3008
02:47:15,350 --> 02:47:16,549
Nothing is blocking the meat.

3009
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:21,139
Do they need more space?

3010
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:24,260
They can eat, right?

3011
02:47:24,819 --> 02:47:32,899
There we go, yeah.

3012
02:47:32,899 --> 02:47:34,260
See, now let's get some water in there.

3013
02:47:34,979 --> 02:47:38,819
Get some toys.

3014
02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:41,329
Live food.

3015
02:47:41,889 --> 02:47:49,430
Okay.

3016
02:47:50,319 --> 02:47:51,360
Live lizards.

3017
02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:54,200
A block of ice.

3018
02:47:55,649 --> 02:47:56,209
A spring.

3019
02:47:56,850 --> 02:47:59,000
It needs to be a little bigger, but that's okay.

3020
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:02,600
Dinosaur prey dummy?

3021
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:04,559
Oh, that's going to be quite the show.

3022
02:48:04,559 --> 02:48:05,280
Put it right in front.

3023
02:48:12,159 --> 02:48:13,440
I'm blocking the pepperoni.

3024
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:18,440
Look at how famous I am.

3025
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:21,909
American Beaver wants to reproduce, but can't find a mate.

3026
02:48:22,549 --> 02:48:23,270
That's sad.

3027
02:48:23,989 --> 02:48:24,950
What are you two doing?

3028
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:31,040
It's, I can't reach the food trough.

3029
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:31,680
How?

3030
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:32,399
It's right here.

3031
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:34,239
Oh, this is probably in the way.

3032
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:36,079
Are they going to start fighting?

3033
02:48:42,290 --> 02:48:42,770
Okay.

3034
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:03,440
I put them both in this thing to have dinosaur sex and have dinosaur babies.

3035
02:49:11,940 --> 02:49:15,620
All right, well, 100, uh, I got 100, 100 guests have visited Yuzu.

3036
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:16,260
That's good.

3037
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:16,739
Cool.

3038
02:49:17,379 --> 02:49:19,760
How much am I going to get for this?

3039
02:49:20,479 --> 02:49:22,260
$860.

3040
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:22,819
Thanks.

3041
02:49:25,159 --> 02:49:26,360
Is this, are you injured?

3042
02:49:31,719 --> 02:49:32,680
Social needs.

3043
02:49:34,819 --> 02:49:36,739
My, oh, my poor social needs.

3044
02:49:37,379 --> 02:49:38,100
I wonder.

3045
02:49:45,090 --> 02:49:50,879
Oh no, what have I done?

3046
02:49:51,680 --> 02:49:55,459
I killed the only friend I had.

3047
02:49:56,180 --> 02:49:57,700
He just broke out of the exhibit.

3048
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:02,159
Well, he ain't going anywhere.

3049
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:04,180
Okay.

3050
02:50:04,180 --> 02:50:05,299
Well, my social needs.

3051
02:50:05,299 --> 02:50:09,780
Who does it, how come he's not going anywhere?

3052
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:12,260
Who does a T-Rex have a friend with?

3053
02:50:19,649 --> 02:50:20,770
Who can be a friend with?

3054
02:50:22,309 --> 02:50:22,950
What?

3055
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:26,129
See, they all want to come up here now.

3056
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:30,979
Beavers.

3057
02:50:31,540 --> 02:50:32,899
I can't put a beaver in here.

3058
02:50:40,149 --> 02:50:41,190
Get more space.

3059
02:50:41,909 --> 02:50:48,079
How am I going to get more space?

3060
02:50:48,799 --> 02:50:51,329
I need to go like this.

3061
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:55,030
The keeper can't reach the T-Rex.

3062
02:50:55,030 --> 02:50:57,459
Oh, cause there's no gate on it.

3063
02:50:57,459 --> 02:50:57,700
Right.

3064
02:50:58,420 --> 02:50:59,219
I'm sorry about that.

3065
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:02,200
Now you can reach the T-Rex.

3066
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:07,120
I need to expand a little bit.

3067
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:10,049
Let's get like a broken leg.

3068
02:51:11,559 --> 02:51:11,799
What?

3069
02:51:11,799 --> 02:51:12,920
I just saw like the, oh nevermind.

3070
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:13,159
Okay.

3071
02:51:14,500 --> 02:51:17,940
So let's, uh, fix this.

3072
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:25,409
And then I need the terrain tool.

3073
02:51:26,129 --> 02:51:28,049
And let's go like this.

3074
02:51:45,360 --> 02:51:45,920
There.

3075
02:51:45,920 --> 02:51:47,040
Now there's enough room for you.

3076
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:59,510
Let's get you fenced back in.

3077
02:52:00,549 --> 02:52:09,540
Okay.

3078
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:12,520
Non-contained.

3079
02:52:12,520 --> 02:52:13,159
Yes, you are.

3080
02:52:13,159 --> 02:52:13,879
That's good.

3081
02:52:13,879 --> 02:52:16,920
Let's get the actual terrain sprayer.

3082
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:18,040
Tropical rainforest.

3083
02:52:20,899 --> 02:52:21,620
Oh, fuck.

3084
02:52:21,620 --> 02:52:22,100
Whatever.

3085
02:52:23,059 --> 02:52:27,270
Okay.

3086
02:52:27,270 --> 02:52:28,229
Now you should be happy.

3087
02:52:28,790 --> 02:52:35,010
This person got lost.

3088
02:52:36,819 --> 02:52:37,139
All right.

3089
02:52:39,239 --> 02:52:41,479
Can't reach the, oh, the dinosaur shit.

3090
02:52:41,479 --> 02:52:41,879
I'll get it.

3091
02:52:52,950 --> 02:52:53,909
I can go right here.

3092
02:52:59,139 --> 02:52:59,860
See?

3093
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:02,340
He gets to scream at everybody from across the park.

3094
02:53:02,979 --> 02:53:04,549
You know how crazy that would be?

3095
02:53:07,270 --> 02:53:07,590
Okay.

3096
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:08,469
I'll get it.

3097
02:53:08,469 --> 02:53:11,889
What does he need?

3098
02:53:12,530 --> 02:53:16,159
Well, I gotta pick up dinosaur poop.

3099
02:53:19,559 --> 02:53:20,200
All right.

3100
02:53:20,200 --> 02:53:22,040
Uh, let's wash his body.

3101
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:24,959
I feel like this would be very unsafe.

3102
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:27,760
All right.

3103
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:28,239
He's good.

3104
02:53:28,239 --> 02:53:29,440
Just got some more water.

3105
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:32,659
Okay.

3106
02:53:32,659 --> 02:53:33,059
We're good.

3107
02:53:37,030 --> 02:53:37,750
I can't leave.

3108
02:53:37,750 --> 02:53:38,709
I need to move this.

3109
02:53:38,709 --> 02:53:40,149
That's why the keeper can't reach him.

3110
02:53:40,790 --> 02:53:46,229
This has to go on the other side.

3111
02:53:46,790 --> 02:53:52,049
This guy's not talking to anyone.

3112
02:53:52,770 --> 02:53:54,229
All right.

3113
02:53:54,229 --> 02:53:55,270
We need to get some attraction up here.

3114
02:53:55,270 --> 02:53:56,709
We need to get some people up here.

3115
02:53:56,709 --> 02:53:56,950
You.

3116
02:53:57,829 --> 02:53:58,069
Help.

3117
02:53:58,069 --> 02:53:59,989
The Tyrus T-Rex is chasing me.

3118
02:54:00,629 --> 02:54:03,159
This zoo is great.

3119
02:54:03,159 --> 02:54:04,520
Well, that feels better.

3120
02:54:04,520 --> 02:54:09,680
So I got the T-Rex exhibit up here.

3121
02:54:10,319 --> 02:54:11,889
He oversees the whole park.

3122
02:54:12,450 --> 02:54:15,479
Fix the hole.

3123
02:54:15,479 --> 02:54:25,879
I'm almost at two stars.

3124
02:54:26,520 --> 02:54:27,239
Getting closer.

3125
02:54:27,879 --> 02:54:30,479
All right.

3126
02:54:30,479 --> 02:54:31,040
You're good.

3127
02:54:33,719 --> 02:54:33,959
All right.

3128
02:54:33,959 --> 02:54:37,000
We got already have more money than the American Beaver exhibit.

3129
02:54:41,409 --> 02:54:43,010
Which there needs to be.

3130
02:54:43,010 --> 02:54:43,649
What was wrong?

3131
02:54:44,290 --> 02:54:44,770
More birth.

3132
02:54:44,770 --> 02:54:45,969
How many Beavers do I have?

3133
02:54:46,690 --> 02:54:49,750
Is there a way I can tell how many Beavers I have?

3134
02:54:50,870 --> 02:54:51,430
16.

3135
02:54:52,629 --> 02:54:53,670
Where's the family tree?

3136
02:54:54,229 --> 02:54:54,549
What?

3137
02:55:01,889 --> 02:55:02,209
What?

3138
02:55:05,569 --> 02:55:06,450
He's still in.

3139
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:09,280
He's still.

3140
02:55:09,280 --> 02:55:10,479
Where did you come from?

3141
02:55:13,159 --> 02:55:13,639
All right.

3142
02:55:13,639 --> 02:55:15,239
It's time to close you up for real.

3143
02:55:15,239 --> 02:55:19,329
Where's like the actual fence?

3144
02:55:19,329 --> 02:55:20,049
Rail fence.

3145
02:55:20,770 --> 02:55:24,180
We need like a dinosaur fence.

3146
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:30,520
There.

3147
02:55:31,079 --> 02:55:33,159
No, I don't want to do an electric fence.

3148
02:55:33,159 --> 02:55:33,959
Dinosaur fence.

3149
02:55:33,959 --> 02:55:34,360
There it is.

3150
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:41,239
He got out.

3151
02:55:41,239 --> 02:55:42,200
He actually got out.

3152
02:55:49,700 --> 02:55:50,500
All right.

3153
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:51,139
He's contained.

3154
02:56:00,549 --> 02:56:01,670
Where was he going to go?

3155
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:02,629
Nowhere.

3156
02:56:02,629 --> 02:56:03,430
All the way up here.

3157
02:56:07,360 --> 02:56:09,360
I need to like replace this whole fence.

3158
02:56:17,879 --> 02:56:18,600
From here.

3159
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:19,000
Here we go.

3160
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:30,479
He wants to be free.

3161
02:56:31,280 --> 02:56:34,959
Well, he should have thought about that before he murdered his cellmate.

3162
02:56:34,959 --> 02:56:35,840
I mean his roommate.

3163
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:36,479
His roommate.

3164
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:38,870
His other...

3165
02:56:38,870 --> 02:56:39,510
His roommate.

3166
02:56:50,850 --> 02:56:51,409
All right.

3167
02:56:51,409 --> 02:56:52,370
He's closed off.

3168
02:56:52,370 --> 02:56:53,809
We have a real fence now.

3169
02:56:54,530 --> 02:56:59,440
Actually, I can probably delete this and then expand it a little more.

3170
02:57:00,479 --> 02:57:00,959
His habitat...

3171
02:57:00,959 --> 02:57:02,399
I'll put his actual habitat back here.

3172
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:08,149
Oops.

3173
02:57:08,149 --> 02:57:08,870
Okay.

3174
02:57:08,870 --> 02:57:13,620
So his actual place to sleep is gonna go right here.

3175
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:15,590
Where are you?

3176
02:57:16,069 --> 02:57:21,479
There you go.

3177
02:57:21,479 --> 02:57:22,760
Right in the corner there.

3178
02:57:23,639 --> 02:57:24,360
Hey, look at that.

3179
02:57:25,909 --> 02:57:28,069
Have a good restful sleep, T-Rex.

3180
02:57:31,479 --> 02:57:32,520
You have toys.

3181
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:33,399
You got stuff to do.

3182
02:57:33,399 --> 02:57:34,120
You got food.

3183
02:57:35,079 --> 02:57:35,719
Let's give him a ball.

3184
02:57:35,719 --> 02:57:36,520
Look, he's going for a bath.

3185
02:57:37,620 --> 02:57:37,940
See?

3186
02:57:37,940 --> 02:57:38,180
Look.

3187
02:57:43,479 --> 02:57:44,040
Why can't you...

3188
02:57:48,389 --> 02:57:50,149
This is a dinosaur fence.

3189
02:57:51,270 --> 02:57:53,430
Specifically to hold dinosaurs.

3190
02:57:54,229 --> 02:57:56,469
How did you get out of here?

3191
02:57:56,469 --> 02:58:03,569
He found the weak point in the structure.

3192
02:58:04,209 --> 02:58:13,909
He's not gonna be able to go anywhere anyways.

3193
02:58:15,639 --> 02:58:16,760
Where are you going?

3194
02:58:19,250 --> 02:58:20,450
Are you going?

3195
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:24,840
Hold on.

3196
02:58:28,790 --> 02:58:30,549
He's escaping the whole zoo.

3197
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:33,239
Is he?

3198
02:58:33,959 --> 02:58:43,510
This biome is not suitable for the T-Rex.

3199
02:58:43,510 --> 02:58:44,629
Well, that's his own fault.

3200
02:58:58,309 --> 02:58:59,989
Get back in there where you belong.

3201
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:03,239
You don't belong out here.

3202
02:59:03,879 --> 02:59:04,760
What are you mad at?

3203
02:59:05,399 --> 02:59:07,139
What's he angry with?

3204
02:59:07,139 --> 02:59:07,780
What's happening?

3205
02:59:08,340 --> 02:59:15,670
Who's he angry with?

3206
02:59:16,229 --> 02:59:27,760
Here, I'll give you a bath.

3207
02:59:27,760 --> 02:59:29,200
American Bee before is pregnant.

3208
02:59:31,170 --> 02:59:31,489
Okay.

3209
02:59:34,020 --> 02:59:34,979
Is this where you want to be?

3210
02:59:35,620 --> 02:59:36,819
I'll put a fence around you here.

3211
02:59:39,159 --> 02:59:40,040
No, he's going back.

3212
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:50,840
I think he's realizing that this is not where I wanted to go at all.

3213
02:59:51,479 --> 02:59:59,569
He needs to go back to his habitat.

3214
03:00:00,290 --> 03:00:07,540
You're going the long way.

3215
03:00:10,690 --> 03:00:12,530
Where is he going?

3216
03:00:12,530 --> 03:00:14,209
He's going all the way around.

3217
03:00:14,850 --> 03:00:21,059
What's the correct biome?

3218
03:00:21,059 --> 03:00:21,540
Tropical.

3219
03:00:23,569 --> 03:00:25,489
Uh-oh, he's getting closer to civilization here.

3220
03:00:35,159 --> 03:00:36,440
He looks so tired though.

3221
03:00:36,440 --> 03:00:37,159
What's he going to do?

3222
03:00:40,370 --> 03:00:43,010
He smells the customers.

3223
03:00:50,819 --> 03:00:52,180
He's doing stealth.

3224
03:00:52,739 --> 03:00:54,020
He's sneaking up on everybody.

3225
03:00:54,020 --> 03:00:55,059
Nobody knows he's here.

3226
03:00:57,200 --> 03:00:59,040
This is the stealthiest T-Rex ever.

3227
03:01:18,200 --> 03:01:21,120
He just wants to go to the zoo.

3228
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:24,950
Oh, look at that over there.

3229
03:01:24,950 --> 03:01:28,659
That's a cool gorilla.

3230
03:01:28,659 --> 03:01:30,319
What about the beavers?

3231
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:35,600
He goes to the front, takes money out of the ATM.

3232
03:01:38,040 --> 03:01:39,399
Why is nobody upset about this?

3233
03:01:43,010 --> 03:01:44,370
He just turned into a customer.

3234
03:01:57,079 --> 03:02:02,040
The lady up there is still giving the educational course on the T-Rex.

3235
03:02:04,579 --> 03:02:09,319
If this T-Rex goes into a car and the car drives off, I'm going to shit my pants.

3236
03:02:16,290 --> 03:02:17,649
No, don't shit on somebody.

3237
03:02:19,299 --> 03:02:19,940
Okay, good.

3238
03:02:23,379 --> 03:02:24,899
He's just leaving the park.

3239
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:31,479
Uh-oh, he's getting angry.

3240
03:02:34,290 --> 03:02:35,489
I can't find my car.

3241
03:02:36,049 --> 03:02:38,469
Did I park it in B1?

3242
03:02:42,149 --> 03:02:43,510
Should have taken a picture of it.

3243
03:02:49,559 --> 03:02:51,559
One dinosaur has roamed the earth.

3244
03:02:57,299 --> 03:02:59,940
No, no, he's going to the beaver enclosure.

3245
03:02:59,940 --> 03:03:01,299
The beavers are going to get out now.

3246
03:03:05,409 --> 03:03:14,159
He got an extra life.

3247
03:03:24,260 --> 03:03:25,219
He is the car.

3248
03:03:25,219 --> 03:03:27,760
Here goes the beaver.

3249
03:03:27,760 --> 03:03:29,600
Oh no, a beaver escaped.

3250
03:03:29,600 --> 03:03:37,299
The beaver is not going to hurt anybody, right?

3251
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:43,219
If the T-Rex is less aggressive than a fucking beaver, I'm going to be fucking so pissed off.

3252
03:03:50,420 --> 03:03:51,620
Who's beatboxing?

3253
03:03:52,899 --> 03:03:53,860
Oh shit.

3254
03:03:56,229 --> 03:03:57,750
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

3255
03:03:57,750 --> 03:03:58,709
He actually woke up.

3256
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:02,979
He woke up.

3257
03:04:08,530 --> 03:04:09,649
He's going to drink water.

3258
03:04:10,290 --> 03:04:12,290
He's going to drink water out of his phone.

3259
03:04:16,069 --> 03:04:18,319
He was just thirsty.

3260
03:04:18,319 --> 03:04:19,120
That's all he wanted.

3261
03:04:22,209 --> 03:04:23,729
I'll put more water in the food dish.

3262
03:04:23,729 --> 03:04:24,850
Look at how pissed off the beaver is.

3263
03:04:24,850 --> 03:04:25,729
The beaver is going to fight him.

3264
03:04:27,139 --> 03:04:28,659
That's a territorial beaver.

3265
03:04:29,299 --> 03:04:31,590
He's strutting his ass out.

3266
03:04:32,149 --> 03:04:35,219
American beaver has been put in a crate.

3267
03:04:35,219 --> 03:04:46,370
Why would you come in the exhibit here?

3268
03:04:47,010 --> 03:05:01,729
Where's the nearest beaver?

3269
03:05:01,729 --> 03:05:05,090
All right, just yeah.

3270
03:05:06,739 --> 03:05:07,620
Don't fuck with me.

3271
03:05:08,260 --> 03:05:19,430
I gotta get a photo of that.

3272
03:05:19,430 --> 03:05:35,090
Wait, did you just, did you just come over?

3273
03:05:44,399 --> 03:05:45,280
That's kind of scary.

3274
03:05:45,280 --> 03:05:46,000
I'm not going to lie.

3275
03:05:52,770 --> 03:05:55,239
Honey, I think it's getting closer.

3276
03:05:55,239 --> 03:06:13,670
Out of film.

3277
03:06:13,670 --> 03:06:15,110
We're just filming a movie over here.

3278
03:06:15,110 --> 03:06:16,069
Don't worry.

3279
03:06:16,069 --> 03:06:20,100
He really is just so fucked up.

3280
03:06:20,100 --> 03:06:21,379
Like what's his deal?

3281
03:06:21,379 --> 03:06:28,360
Another birth.

3282
03:06:28,360 --> 03:06:32,209
Let the beaver out.

3283
03:06:32,209 --> 03:06:32,530
You know what?

3284
03:06:32,530 --> 03:06:33,170
Fuck it.

3285
03:06:33,170 --> 03:06:34,129
It's time for a battle.

3286
03:06:34,770 --> 03:06:39,040
Who's going to win?

3287
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:46,579
It's time for a real battle.

3288
03:06:57,280 --> 03:06:58,639
What if they start having sex?

3289
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:04,479
Uh-oh.

3290
03:07:07,319 --> 03:07:08,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3291
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:15,799
No, don't fight the T-Rex.

3292
03:07:15,799 --> 03:07:16,760
Oh my god.

3293
03:07:16,760 --> 03:07:17,879
He's freaking out.

3294
03:07:17,879 --> 03:07:31,329
He's freaking out.

3295
03:07:31,329 --> 03:07:33,940
They're working together.

3296
03:07:33,940 --> 03:07:35,459
They should not be working together.

3297
03:07:41,559 --> 03:07:43,079
The T-Rex was just put in a crate.

3298
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:06,639
All right, it's time to.

3299
03:08:06,639 --> 03:08:09,479
Oh, I need to.

3300
03:08:10,280 --> 03:08:10,930
I need to.

3301
03:08:10,930 --> 03:08:12,850
Where's my list of staff?

3302
03:08:12,850 --> 03:08:20,020
I want to get rid of this staff.

3303
03:08:20,020 --> 03:08:29,110
I need my staff list.

3304
03:08:29,110 --> 03:08:33,360
No, I don't want more of them.

3305
03:08:33,360 --> 03:08:33,840
Where is it?

3306
03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:34,479
How do I get there?

3307
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:36,079
From here, right?

3308
03:08:36,079 --> 03:08:36,579
No.

3309
03:08:38,319 --> 03:08:44,280
Zoo stats, zoo status, photo album, zoo fame.

3310
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:48,799
There we go.

3311
03:08:48,799 --> 03:08:49,299
Okay.

3312
03:08:50,959 --> 03:08:52,399
So we need some new staff.

3313
03:08:53,360 --> 03:08:54,920
I need to.

3314
03:08:54,920 --> 03:08:56,360
I want to fire literally everybody.

3315
03:08:58,950 --> 03:08:59,430
You're gone.

3316
03:09:00,149 --> 03:09:01,379
You're gone.

3317
03:09:02,020 --> 03:09:03,350
You know what I'm saying?

3318
03:09:03,350 --> 03:09:03,989
Let them fight.

3319
03:09:06,399 --> 03:09:08,559
Dude, is this King Kong versus Godzilla?

3320
03:09:11,170 --> 03:09:12,129
I thought that was the T-Rex.

3321
03:09:12,129 --> 03:09:12,850
It wasn't, apparently.

3322
03:09:12,850 --> 03:09:13,569
Where's the T-Rex?

3323
03:09:20,340 --> 03:09:21,139
Everybody wants to come in here

3324
03:09:21,139 --> 03:09:22,819
and drink out of the same water bowl.

3325
03:09:22,819 --> 03:09:23,459
All right, let's go.

3326
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:44,399
What are they doing?

3327
03:09:47,620 --> 03:09:49,620
They're just like walking around in circles.

3328
03:09:50,680 --> 03:09:52,360
Tyrannosaurus 1 is really hungry.

3329
03:10:04,680 --> 03:10:05,799
He's going all the way up there.

3330
03:10:05,799 --> 03:10:06,200
Hold on.

3331
03:10:15,840 --> 03:10:16,639
Uh-oh.

3332
03:10:16,639 --> 03:10:21,440
Oh no.

3333
03:10:21,440 --> 03:10:23,200
No, he's just breaking through fences.

3334
03:10:23,840 --> 03:10:28,020
He's coming in to steal his food.

3335
03:11:15,010 --> 03:11:23,590
Where are they all going?

3336
03:11:23,590 --> 03:11:25,190
They're just eating the food.

3337
03:11:26,049 --> 03:11:39,459
They're just sharing the food.

3338
03:11:39,459 --> 03:11:49,040
This kid is so excited.

3339
03:11:49,040 --> 03:11:50,319
Yeah, I can't believe it.

3340
03:11:50,319 --> 03:11:52,000
It's just like Jurassic Park.

3341
03:11:52,000 --> 03:12:02,770
What are they eating over there?

3342
03:12:50,959 --> 03:12:53,520
There are more animals outside than people.

3343
03:12:54,159 --> 03:12:56,180
This lady's still giving me a presentation.

3344
03:13:09,459 --> 03:13:37,350
This is the line for the bathroom.

3345
03:13:42,209 --> 03:13:43,569
Oh God.

3346
03:13:43,569 --> 03:13:44,530
I'm up in my fort.

3347
03:13:44,530 --> 03:13:45,409
They can't get up here.

3348
03:14:08,520 --> 03:14:09,159
All right.

3349
03:14:09,159 --> 03:14:12,229
Well, that was fun.

3350
03:14:12,229 --> 03:14:28,399
I want to try one more thing.

3351
03:14:28,399 --> 03:14:30,479
Hold on.

3352
03:14:30,479 --> 03:14:40,399
No, don't save the current game.

3353
03:14:40,399 --> 03:14:41,360
Almost half a star.

3354
03:14:41,360 --> 03:14:42,239
I know, right?

3355
03:14:42,239 --> 03:14:43,569
Doing well.

3356
03:14:46,719 --> 03:14:48,639
You need to go back in here.

3357
03:14:48,639 --> 03:14:52,659
Let me fix this.

3358
03:14:52,659 --> 03:14:55,909
So what's the deal here?

3359
03:14:55,909 --> 03:15:01,319
He can't...

3360
03:15:01,319 --> 03:15:02,200
Electric fence.

3361
03:15:03,639 --> 03:15:05,879
Is this the only way I can contain a T-Rex?

3362
03:15:05,879 --> 03:15:14,389
What if he starts to smash through it?

3363
03:15:14,389 --> 03:15:24,370
Oh, come on.

3364
03:15:24,370 --> 03:15:25,090
Move out of the way.

3365
03:15:25,090 --> 03:15:29,989
I can't believe you can put dinosaurs in this game.

3366
03:15:31,750 --> 03:15:32,870
He's going to get a shock.

3367
03:15:35,829 --> 03:15:37,110
I forget everything we were just doing.

3368
03:15:38,959 --> 03:15:43,040
Something about a place for them to go up to see the T-Rex or something.

3369
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:48,770
What's my favorite wild animal?

3370
03:15:56,840 --> 03:15:58,280
What is my favorite wild animal?

3371
03:15:59,989 --> 03:16:01,430
It was legal to own five of them.

3372
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:05,239
Favorite wild animal.

3373
03:16:06,840 --> 03:16:07,559
Definitely a...

3374
03:16:10,629 --> 03:16:11,430
Probably a laptop.

3375
03:16:13,379 --> 03:16:15,139
Yeah, like a HP laptop.

3376
03:16:15,700 --> 03:16:36,709
What was your question?

3377
03:16:36,709 --> 03:16:37,590
What's my favorite...

3378
03:16:37,590 --> 03:16:38,549
What's my favorite animal?

3379
03:16:42,209 --> 03:16:42,770
Probably like a...

3380
03:16:43,329 --> 03:16:43,729
I don't know.

3381
03:16:44,290 --> 03:16:45,959
Armadillo.

3382
03:16:45,959 --> 03:16:46,360
Be cool.

3383
03:16:49,989 --> 03:16:50,790
I missed a spot?

3384
03:16:54,559 --> 03:16:54,959
No, I didn't.

3385
03:16:54,959 --> 03:16:56,000
Everything's fine.

3386
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:56,879
Oh, I did miss a spot.

3387
03:16:56,879 --> 03:16:57,280
You're right.

3388
03:16:58,790 --> 03:16:59,829
Good catch there.

3389
03:17:04,079 --> 03:17:04,899
Okay.

3390
03:17:04,899 --> 03:17:08,739
He's contained and he's not very happy, but that's his own problem.

3391
03:17:12,290 --> 03:17:13,329
Exercise level.

3392
03:17:13,969 --> 03:17:16,440
So go interact with this thing.

3393
03:17:16,440 --> 03:17:17,479
What do you think I put it here for?

3394
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:25,010
Okay, now I need to get in.

3395
03:17:27,510 --> 03:17:28,229
Now you can get in.

3396
03:17:29,270 --> 03:17:30,950
Food, water, dinosaur.

3397
03:17:32,739 --> 03:17:33,940
45 cents.

3398
03:17:34,579 --> 03:17:37,350
Hello, people.

3399
03:17:45,110 --> 03:17:46,389
What the fuck are they doing?

3400
03:17:46,389 --> 03:17:48,149
Why are they walking in circles up here?

3401
03:17:53,540 --> 03:17:55,620
Are they making a whirlpool on the way up?

3402
03:17:56,340 --> 03:18:00,719
All right, now let's get...

3403
03:18:00,719 --> 03:18:01,200
What was I gonna...

3404
03:18:01,200 --> 03:18:01,520
Oh, yeah.

3405
03:18:01,520 --> 03:18:02,319
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3406
03:18:02,319 --> 03:18:03,680
I want whales.

3407
03:18:04,319 --> 03:18:05,600
That sounds like fun.

3408
03:18:05,600 --> 03:18:09,360
So I need a tank enclosure, right?

3409
03:18:10,469 --> 03:18:11,270
Of some sort.

3410
03:18:11,829 --> 03:18:16,790
What do I need for that?

3411
03:18:17,510 --> 03:18:20,930
I want to make a couple of whale sharks.

3412
03:18:27,159 --> 03:18:29,879
All right, biome and benthic.

3413
03:18:32,079 --> 03:18:34,370
Okay, I need water.

3414
03:18:35,170 --> 03:18:35,409
What?

3415
03:18:35,409 --> 03:18:36,610
Can I just put them in a lake?

3416
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:42,680
I don't know.

3417
03:18:59,219 --> 03:19:02,340
This biome is not suitable for whale shark.

3418
03:19:02,340 --> 03:19:02,739
Well, hold on.

3419
03:19:02,739 --> 03:19:10,229
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3420
03:19:10,229 --> 03:19:10,469
There.

3421
03:19:10,469 --> 03:19:11,190
Okay, tank.

3422
03:19:11,190 --> 03:19:11,670
There it is.

3423
03:19:11,670 --> 03:19:11,989
All right.

3424
03:19:11,989 --> 03:19:12,950
I need to...

3425
03:19:12,950 --> 03:19:14,149
What the hell am I thinking?

3426
03:19:14,149 --> 03:19:18,079
I can make a diving board.

3427
03:19:20,959 --> 03:19:22,879
All right, I need to get rid of this then.

3428
03:19:23,520 --> 03:19:25,159
So let's go back.

3429
03:19:25,159 --> 03:19:26,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3430
03:19:26,840 --> 03:19:33,540
How do I replace this?

3431
03:19:35,940 --> 03:19:40,159
Can I fill this up?

3432
03:19:41,799 --> 03:19:42,920
I can't fill this.

3433
03:19:42,920 --> 03:19:44,790
I don't know what the hell I've done here.

3434
03:19:45,670 --> 03:19:48,280
I created a huge problem for myself.

3435
03:19:49,159 --> 03:19:55,959
So I need a new biome.

3436
03:19:56,600 --> 03:19:57,479
Get rid of all this shit.

3437
03:19:59,319 --> 03:20:02,500
All right, biome.

3438
03:20:02,500 --> 03:20:03,219
What biome?

3439
03:20:03,219 --> 03:20:03,940
This is tank.

3440
03:20:03,940 --> 03:20:05,219
Tank, tank, tank, tank, tank.

3441
03:20:06,020 --> 03:20:09,520
So this is tank wall.

3442
03:20:12,690 --> 03:20:13,889
Raise tank wall.

3443
03:20:13,889 --> 03:20:14,290
No.

3444
03:20:14,290 --> 03:20:15,329
All right, let's go like this.

3445
03:20:16,049 --> 03:20:24,959
What the fuck are you doing?

3446
03:20:25,520 --> 03:20:33,969
I need to extend this shit out.

3447
03:20:33,969 --> 03:20:34,290
Hold on.

3448
03:20:35,010 --> 03:20:44,370
It's on like a cliff.

3449
03:20:44,370 --> 03:20:45,090
It's not going to work.

3450
03:20:45,090 --> 03:20:46,129
I need to flatten this out.

3451
03:20:48,520 --> 03:20:49,000
Flatten it.

3452
03:20:59,520 --> 03:21:00,239
That should work.

3453
03:21:00,239 --> 03:21:01,200
Get rid of the rocks.

3454
03:21:03,760 --> 03:21:04,159
Ah!

3455
03:21:07,329 --> 03:21:10,370
Oh!

3456
03:21:10,450 --> 03:21:11,090
What?

3457
03:21:11,090 --> 03:21:23,219
It's all right.

3458
03:21:23,219 --> 03:21:29,409
Okay, here we go.

3459
03:21:29,969 --> 03:21:49,750
What is going on?

3460
03:21:54,799 --> 03:21:56,879
Raw fucking rectangle.

3461
03:22:00,200 --> 03:22:02,280
It's because I was on the rectangle mode.

3462
03:22:02,280 --> 03:22:03,639
I need to be on free form.

3463
03:22:09,569 --> 03:22:11,520
Good luck.

3464
03:22:11,520 --> 03:22:13,120
How am I even going to fix this?

3465
03:22:13,120 --> 03:22:14,639
Okay, I can fix it like this.

3466
03:22:15,440 --> 03:22:19,649
No, I can't.

3467
03:22:19,649 --> 03:22:21,090
Jesus Christ.

3468
03:22:21,090 --> 03:22:35,159
All right, we're good.

3469
03:22:35,159 --> 03:23:04,500
All right, let's do it.

3470
03:23:05,459 --> 03:23:06,690
I'm sorry.

3471
03:23:06,690 --> 03:23:07,729
That was fucking loud.

3472
03:23:07,729 --> 03:23:11,430
So now I need to go back here.

3473
03:23:11,430 --> 03:23:13,040
Free form mode.

3474
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:14,079
Tank wall.

3475
03:23:14,079 --> 03:23:30,799
Bingo.

3476
03:23:30,799 --> 03:23:32,559
More beaver pregnancies.

3477
03:23:33,360 --> 03:23:37,540
Perfect.

3478
03:23:37,540 --> 03:23:44,280
Why is this not suitable for whale shark?

3479
03:23:44,280 --> 03:23:51,639
What's wrong with it?

3480
03:23:51,639 --> 03:24:01,459
What's wrong with it?

3481
03:24:01,459 --> 03:24:10,290
What's the problem?

3482
03:24:13,590 --> 03:24:14,229
Salt water.

3483
03:24:14,229 --> 03:24:14,709
How do I?

3484
03:24:14,709 --> 03:24:23,190
Does there a check a box for salt water?

3485
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:24,549
Change the biome.

3486
03:24:24,549 --> 03:24:38,340
They can't survive in pools.

3487
03:24:38,340 --> 03:24:44,760
So you're telling me that benthic.

3488
03:24:44,760 --> 03:24:48,420
So I did have...

3489
03:24:48,420 --> 03:25:01,840
Problem solved.

3490
03:25:01,840 --> 03:25:03,440
I turned the water benthic.

3491
03:25:03,440 --> 03:25:06,629
That's a 3000 IQ play right there.

3492
03:25:18,500 --> 03:25:18,899
All right.

3493
03:25:18,899 --> 03:25:19,940
So what do you eat?

3494
03:25:19,940 --> 03:25:26,500
Let me get some help here.

3495
03:25:27,299 --> 03:25:31,280
Oh, we got a reef.

3496
03:25:31,280 --> 03:25:36,639
Food box with plankton.

3497
03:25:36,639 --> 03:25:41,590
We got a little toy or something.

3498
03:25:41,590 --> 03:25:44,129
A buoy.

3499
03:25:44,129 --> 03:25:45,170
Weird clam thing.

3500
03:25:45,809 --> 03:25:47,889
You don't need a habitat.

3501
03:25:47,889 --> 03:25:49,010
You just sleep on the ground.

3502
03:25:50,370 --> 03:25:51,409
A couple of cool rocks.

3503
03:25:52,129 --> 03:25:53,379
Nice fireworks.

3504
03:25:54,020 --> 03:25:56,290
Get some starfish in here.

3505
03:25:59,270 --> 03:25:59,989
All right, nice.

3506
03:26:00,879 --> 03:26:02,159
So this is ready to go.

3507
03:26:02,159 --> 03:26:02,959
Let's make some money.

3508
03:26:12,120 --> 03:26:13,879
I need this to keep going across.

3509
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:19,780
See, look it.

3510
03:26:20,340 --> 03:26:23,430
I should be a video game designer.

3511
03:26:25,280 --> 03:26:26,319
Imagine this is a town.

3512
03:26:33,590 --> 03:26:38,899
All right, that's good.

3513
03:26:42,530 --> 03:26:44,370
In fact, go all the way up.

3514
03:26:44,370 --> 03:26:45,489
So we can look at the glass.

3515
03:26:47,010 --> 03:26:52,930
Why is it just a rock in the middle of the road?

3516
03:26:52,930 --> 03:26:53,409
Get out of here.

3517
03:26:54,290 --> 03:26:59,670
So here's the bathroom.

3518
03:26:59,670 --> 03:27:00,309
Now we need...

3519
03:27:01,190 --> 03:27:02,040
Oh, fuck.

3520
03:27:02,040 --> 03:27:02,360
I forgot.

3521
03:27:02,360 --> 03:27:02,760
Did I fire?

3522
03:27:02,760 --> 03:27:03,799
No, I didn't fire everybody.

3523
03:27:04,520 --> 03:27:09,760
What does American people want to do?

3524
03:27:11,559 --> 03:27:11,719
For...

3525
03:27:11,719 --> 03:27:14,120
Okay, for one second, I thought that was blood

3526
03:27:14,760 --> 03:27:16,200
all over that and pouring out of the front.

3527
03:27:16,840 --> 03:27:18,389
Say, what the hell happened?

3528
03:27:18,389 --> 03:27:19,750
So wait, you can't find a good mate?

3529
03:27:20,959 --> 03:27:21,360
Why not?

3530
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:23,299
What's wrong?

3531
03:27:27,860 --> 03:27:28,500
You need a mate.

3532
03:27:29,219 --> 03:27:32,500
You're doing fine.

3533
03:27:35,399 --> 03:27:36,360
Here, I'll help you.

3534
03:27:57,569 --> 03:27:59,329
Name the beavers after chat.

3535
03:28:00,129 --> 03:28:01,409
There's like 40 of them.

3536
03:28:12,319 --> 03:28:13,440
No, I can't do like...

3537
03:28:13,440 --> 03:28:15,520
I can't do like Beaver Rick.

3538
03:28:15,520 --> 03:28:17,600
Because that's...

3539
03:28:18,500 --> 03:28:19,860
I'm not doing Beaver Rick.

3540
03:28:21,239 --> 03:28:26,879
Uh, Bevo.

3541
03:28:31,940 --> 03:28:39,719
Bevo, Stevo, Ornelius.

3542
03:28:49,270 --> 03:29:06,979
Uh, okay.

3543
03:29:06,979 --> 03:29:22,629
Uh, so long.

3544
03:29:22,629 --> 03:29:23,270
Uh, no.

3545
03:29:26,260 --> 03:29:28,100
No, no, no, not not schlaw.

3546
03:29:28,100 --> 03:29:28,899
No.

3547
03:29:28,899 --> 03:29:36,629
Uh, uh...

3548
03:29:39,090 --> 03:29:48,319
All right, there are your names.

3549
03:29:48,319 --> 03:29:49,040
They're done.

3550
03:29:49,040 --> 03:29:57,110
All right, what happened since I was gone?

3551
03:29:57,110 --> 03:29:57,989
I need to make...

3552
03:29:57,989 --> 03:29:58,870
I need to make money over here.

3553
03:29:58,870 --> 03:29:59,670
Come on.

3554
03:29:59,670 --> 03:30:01,969
You need a friend.

3555
03:30:01,969 --> 03:30:02,450
Okay.

3556
03:30:02,450 --> 03:30:03,090
So I need a...

3557
03:30:03,090 --> 03:30:03,489
This is a...

3558
03:30:04,049 --> 03:30:07,719
Okay, so we're gonna do...

3559
03:30:07,719 --> 03:30:08,200
We're gonna do...

3560
03:30:14,079 --> 03:30:15,520
We need left and right here.

3561
03:30:16,079 --> 03:30:20,559
So this is...

3562
03:30:21,280 --> 03:30:23,520
I need...

3563
03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:32,850
Okay.

3564
03:30:33,569 --> 03:30:43,350
Yin and Yang, left and right.

3565
03:30:43,909 --> 03:30:44,469
Up and down.

3566
03:30:45,030 --> 03:30:50,959
Should just name them Yin and Yang.

3567
03:30:50,959 --> 03:31:06,819
All right, so now the baby needs to be called middle.

3568
03:31:06,819 --> 03:31:09,250
Good.

3569
03:31:09,329 --> 03:31:14,340
More American beavers.

3570
03:31:14,340 --> 03:31:16,579
Now I want to add...

3571
03:31:16,579 --> 03:31:17,940
Let me see what it looks like from afar.

3572
03:31:18,500 --> 03:31:18,979
Pretty cool.

3573
03:31:20,020 --> 03:31:20,659
Where's T-Rex?

3574
03:31:20,659 --> 03:31:21,379
T-Rex happy?

3575
03:31:22,739 --> 03:31:23,459
Actually, yeah.

3576
03:31:24,100 --> 03:31:26,239
The T-Rex is actually having a good time.

3577
03:31:30,469 --> 03:31:32,389
I mean, at this point, I think it, like, seriously.

3578
03:31:33,379 --> 03:31:34,659
This zoo needs some dessert carts.

3579
03:31:34,659 --> 03:31:35,219
I'm exhausted.

3580
03:31:35,219 --> 03:31:36,180
I need a place to rest.

3581
03:31:37,989 --> 03:31:40,549
Maybe if you didn't walk in circles the whole entire time.

3582
03:31:41,190 --> 03:31:47,379
What do I do about this?

3583
03:31:47,379 --> 03:31:48,659
Because they're just clogging the whole thing.

3584
03:31:49,379 --> 03:32:01,590
Just get out of the way.

3585
03:32:06,979 --> 03:32:08,819
Just get up there.

3586
03:32:08,819 --> 03:32:10,979
Why is he sprinting over here so fast?

3587
03:32:10,979 --> 03:32:11,780
What's his problem?

3588
03:32:11,780 --> 03:32:12,420
What are you doing?

3589
03:32:12,979 --> 03:32:15,600
What's wrong with him?

3590
03:32:19,479 --> 03:32:20,360
That's what...

3591
03:32:20,360 --> 03:32:21,559
That's what this was for, huh?

3592
03:32:22,440 --> 03:32:24,899
I gotta get over there right now

3593
03:32:24,899 --> 03:32:26,739
because I gotta rake this shit as fast as I can.

3594
03:32:28,559 --> 03:32:29,760
All right, well, whatever.

3595
03:32:29,760 --> 03:32:35,010
I need to use the bathroom.

3596
03:32:35,010 --> 03:32:36,290
I can't wait to see some animals.

3597
03:32:43,920 --> 03:32:45,440
Now he's running in circles.

3598
03:32:46,549 --> 03:32:47,030
Thank God.

3599
03:32:47,670 --> 03:33:01,719
I shouldn't have to do this.

3600
03:33:05,799 --> 03:33:06,920
It's time to go home.

3601
03:33:07,639 --> 03:33:09,909
Well, they...

3602
03:33:09,909 --> 03:33:11,590
Was that guy's name Sandler?

3603
03:33:11,590 --> 03:33:18,979
I thought it was Adam Sandler.

3604
03:33:18,979 --> 03:33:20,180
Well, when this first came up,

3605
03:33:20,180 --> 03:33:22,420
I thought they said I can smell the restroom from here.

3606
03:33:23,139 --> 03:33:26,200
Oh, that's disgusting.

3607
03:33:28,639 --> 03:33:30,159
That's absolutely revolting.

3608
03:33:30,719 --> 03:33:35,489
They're not gonna ever leave here.

3609
03:33:36,049 --> 03:33:40,479
I don't really have a solution.

3610
03:33:42,389 --> 03:33:44,790
Hold on, are you gonna get like a big roar or no?

3611
03:33:45,510 --> 03:33:47,510
No one's even giving me any money.

3612
03:33:49,540 --> 03:33:52,100
Need more water for right and left over here.

3613
03:33:53,670 --> 03:33:54,229
I will add it.

3614
03:33:54,790 --> 03:34:02,629
I'm going for it, I'm going for it.

3615
03:34:02,629 --> 03:34:04,389
It's kind of in a weird spot, isn't it?

3616
03:34:04,950 --> 03:34:15,569
It's not the right biome.

3617
03:34:17,559 --> 03:34:18,840
Will it mix the water together?

3618
03:34:20,200 --> 03:34:20,760
There we go.

3619
03:34:20,760 --> 03:34:21,079
Look at that.

3620
03:34:21,079 --> 03:34:21,879
I don't even have to do anything.

3621
03:34:30,260 --> 03:34:31,700
Artifact is looking great.

3622
03:34:33,319 --> 03:34:33,959
Artifact?

3623
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:38,040
I'm not gonna play artifact.

3624
03:34:42,200 --> 03:34:43,639
No, today was just the chill day

3625
03:34:43,639 --> 03:34:45,159
where I wanted just to play something.

3626
03:34:45,959 --> 03:34:46,360
Hang out.

3627
03:34:52,610 --> 03:34:53,969
Why would I ever play artifact?

3628
03:34:54,530 --> 03:34:56,319
I really want to get rid of this.

3629
03:35:02,309 --> 03:35:02,790
There we go.

3630
03:35:02,790 --> 03:35:03,030
All right.

3631
03:35:03,030 --> 03:35:03,989
Now you get enough room, right?

3632
03:35:04,950 --> 03:35:07,190
Need more places to rest.

3633
03:35:10,840 --> 03:35:11,399
Well, shit.

3634
03:35:12,200 --> 03:35:12,840
There's plenty of...

3635
03:35:12,840 --> 03:35:13,879
No one's even using them.

3636
03:35:15,889 --> 03:35:17,010
Am I really getting complaints

3637
03:35:17,010 --> 03:35:18,690
about there's nowhere for me to rest

3638
03:35:18,690 --> 03:35:20,610
and all the benches are empty?

3639
03:35:22,000 --> 03:35:22,479
Empty.

3640
03:35:22,479 --> 03:35:22,959
All of them.

3641
03:35:25,620 --> 03:35:26,340
Oh, really?

3642
03:35:26,340 --> 03:35:27,379
Was it you that complained?

3643
03:35:46,639 --> 03:35:47,440
That dude myself.

3644
03:35:48,319 --> 03:36:00,520
Put it in the bag.

3645
03:36:00,520 --> 03:36:01,559
I just had the bag out.

3646
03:36:05,879 --> 03:36:06,440
I'm tired.

3647
03:36:06,440 --> 03:36:06,920
I'm tired.

3648
03:36:06,920 --> 03:36:07,399
I'm tired.

3649
03:36:07,399 --> 03:36:08,040
I'm tired.

3650
03:36:11,079 --> 03:36:11,969
Fine.

3651
03:36:11,969 --> 03:36:12,450
Do you want...

3652
03:36:13,010 --> 03:36:14,690
Am I gonna put out like beds and shit here?

3653
03:36:17,920 --> 03:36:18,239
All right.

3654
03:36:18,239 --> 03:36:19,440
Where is giant bed?

3655
03:36:19,440 --> 03:36:27,120
Ooh, no, that's fine.

3656
03:36:27,120 --> 03:36:27,680
I can stay there.

3657
03:36:36,760 --> 03:36:37,559
Park information.

3658
03:36:38,120 --> 03:36:41,090
That's kind of important.

3659
03:36:42,760 --> 03:36:44,200
What about like just sitting down here?

3660
03:36:46,920 --> 03:36:48,280
Can I lose this game?

3661
03:36:48,280 --> 03:36:49,479
Not when I have infinite money.

3662
03:36:51,940 --> 03:36:53,139
More places to rest.

3663
03:36:53,139 --> 03:36:54,100
What the fuck?

3664
03:36:54,100 --> 03:36:55,379
I need a place to rest.

3665
03:36:56,260 --> 03:37:02,209
Is this the only thing they can see?

3666
03:37:04,239 --> 03:37:06,079
Fat is going to give birth.

3667
03:37:06,639 --> 03:37:07,120
All right.

3668
03:37:08,209 --> 03:37:08,770
That's good.

3669
03:37:19,350 --> 03:37:20,469
There ain't nobody listening.

3670
03:37:21,110 --> 03:37:25,829
Those people are still complaining about the bench.

3671
03:37:28,389 --> 03:37:29,350
That's a great move.

3672
03:37:30,069 --> 03:37:32,389
How do I up your salary?

3673
03:37:33,590 --> 03:37:38,340
And so what else can we do for him?

3674
03:37:38,340 --> 03:37:38,819
Okay.

3675
03:37:38,819 --> 03:37:39,319
Now.

3676
03:37:40,659 --> 03:37:41,219
Okay.

3677
03:37:41,219 --> 03:37:41,719
Now.

3678
03:37:44,659 --> 03:37:45,059
What's happening?

3679
03:37:45,059 --> 03:37:45,540
What's going on?

3680
03:37:46,739 --> 03:37:47,940
Oh, they're just having babies.

3681
03:37:49,700 --> 03:37:59,120
It was inevitable.

3682
03:38:01,459 --> 03:38:02,500
Oh my god.

3683
03:38:03,780 --> 03:38:22,850
It's too many beavers.

3684
03:38:22,850 --> 03:38:23,489
They're really...

3685
03:38:23,489 --> 03:38:30,069
And it's ruining my whole aesthetic here.

3686
03:38:30,069 --> 03:38:31,750
Oh, Steve-O needs more space.

3687
03:38:31,750 --> 03:38:33,190
I better take it seriously now.

3688
03:38:33,989 --> 03:38:34,489
Okay.

3689
03:38:37,409 --> 03:39:13,639
Uh-oh.

3690
03:39:13,639 --> 03:39:15,479
It's not the Chad beaver.

3691
03:39:15,479 --> 03:39:17,809
Don't go after the Chad beaver.

3692
03:39:17,809 --> 03:39:21,350
Oh, no.

3693
03:39:23,489 --> 03:39:24,610
He's gonna get him.

3694
03:39:24,610 --> 03:39:29,489
How's the space looking now?

3695
03:39:31,190 --> 03:39:32,149
We still out of space?

3696
03:39:33,540 --> 03:39:35,459
From race and has died.

3697
03:39:36,260 --> 03:39:37,620
Of old age.

3698
03:39:37,620 --> 03:40:01,700
We're good?

3699
03:40:01,700 --> 03:40:02,659
He's not even eating them.

3700
03:40:02,659 --> 03:40:04,020
He's just killing them for no reason.

3701
03:40:04,020 --> 03:40:05,059
Well, don't worry.

3702
03:40:05,059 --> 03:40:06,260
I have a solution for that.

3703
03:40:06,260 --> 03:40:07,940
Remember we talked about recycling?

3704
03:40:08,500 --> 03:40:09,700
The natural order of the world?

3705
03:40:12,100 --> 03:40:12,579
All right.

3706
03:40:12,579 --> 03:40:15,059
After he kills like three more people, you'll see.

3707
03:40:23,350 --> 03:40:24,069
I think that won't...

3708
03:40:24,069 --> 03:40:25,510
I think that beaver was about to give birth.

3709
03:40:35,510 --> 03:40:36,870
How do they still need more space?

3710
03:40:40,870 --> 03:40:41,190
Hold on.

3711
03:40:41,190 --> 03:40:42,629
How do I get to my photo album?

3712
03:40:47,280 --> 03:40:48,559
No, I want to get to the photo album.

3713
03:40:49,200 --> 03:40:52,920
How do I delete pictures?

3714
03:40:53,479 --> 03:41:03,200
Look, these are so awful.

3715
03:41:03,200 --> 03:41:03,840
Delete them all.

3716
03:41:07,639 --> 03:41:09,719
I have like four pictures of the trash.

3717
03:41:09,719 --> 03:41:22,340
I want to keep those ones.

3718
03:41:25,569 --> 03:41:26,690
I like that one.

3719
03:41:26,690 --> 03:41:27,649
I like this string.

3720
03:41:28,290 --> 03:41:29,729
Picture the ground.

3721
03:41:30,819 --> 03:41:31,059
All right.

3722
03:41:31,059 --> 03:41:31,860
Let's see if I can get it.

3723
03:41:32,420 --> 03:41:34,739
I want to get a mid-jump tiger shot.

3724
03:41:40,229 --> 03:41:41,030
Into the water.

3725
03:41:41,030 --> 03:41:41,530
Jesus.

3726
03:41:45,079 --> 03:41:45,479
No, no.

3727
03:41:45,479 --> 03:41:46,120
Don't...

3728
03:41:46,120 --> 03:41:46,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3729
03:41:47,399 --> 03:42:01,319
Who's he going for?

3730
03:42:01,319 --> 03:42:01,799
Who's he going for?

3731
03:42:02,600 --> 03:42:04,200
Who's he going for?

3732
03:42:06,559 --> 03:42:07,360
Right here.

3733
03:42:07,360 --> 03:42:12,920
Oh, he's gonna kill them all.

3734
03:42:12,920 --> 03:42:13,639
I gotta get him out of here.

3735
03:42:13,639 --> 03:42:14,680
He's gonna kill them all, actually.

3736
03:42:14,680 --> 03:42:15,799
He really might.

3737
03:42:15,799 --> 03:42:18,370
Okay, good work.

3738
03:42:18,370 --> 03:42:24,120
Remember we talked about recycling?

3739
03:42:31,920 --> 03:42:32,559
Not wasted.

3740
03:42:33,120 --> 03:42:37,920
See, somebody adopted a cave line.

3741
03:42:37,920 --> 03:42:39,200
Don't ask me who the hell would do that.

3742
03:42:39,760 --> 03:42:45,440
See, he's got food.

3743
03:42:46,159 --> 03:42:49,459
He's got food for probably the next five or six days.

3744
03:42:50,180 --> 03:42:53,430
See, he's giving it a sniff.

3745
03:42:54,149 --> 03:42:57,280
He's not like it.

3746
03:42:57,280 --> 03:42:57,840
No, he likes it.

3747
03:42:57,840 --> 03:43:00,739
See, he's happy.

3748
03:43:01,540 --> 03:43:06,690
This is the biggest traction here.

3749
03:43:07,409 --> 03:43:10,610
$4,400 of donations.

3750
03:43:10,610 --> 03:43:12,450
That's pretty great considering...

3751
03:43:13,170 --> 03:43:17,799
I don't think the beaver exhibit has even come close.

3752
03:43:17,879 --> 03:43:18,440
Not even half.

3753
03:43:19,079 --> 03:43:22,209
The guests are crying.

3754
03:43:22,930 --> 03:43:26,290
Well, maybe if the guests actually listened to their own advice

3755
03:43:26,290 --> 03:43:28,290
and sat on the benches that are here,

3756
03:43:28,290 --> 03:43:29,489
ready for them to be sat on.

3757
03:43:30,290 --> 03:43:34,770
They're available.

3758
03:43:40,680 --> 03:43:41,959
I've had just about enough of...

3759
03:43:42,760 --> 03:43:43,639
What are they saying?

3760
03:43:43,639 --> 03:43:44,280
I'm exhausted.

3761
03:43:44,280 --> 03:43:44,840
I'm exhausted.

3762
03:43:44,840 --> 03:43:45,559
I'm exhausted.

3763
03:44:01,170 --> 03:44:02,049
You exhausted now?

3764
03:44:04,450 --> 03:44:06,049
Holy shit, they're running off to the end.

3765
03:44:06,049 --> 03:44:06,850
They...

3766
03:44:06,850 --> 03:44:09,239
It worked.

3767
03:44:11,569 --> 03:44:12,370
Fixed the ramp?

3768
03:44:12,370 --> 03:44:13,489
What's wrong with the ramp?

3769
03:44:18,979 --> 03:44:20,500
They were just sprinting off the edges.

3770
03:44:21,059 --> 03:44:45,090
Okay, I fixed it.

3771
03:44:45,090 --> 03:44:46,690
Sacrifices must be made.

3772
03:44:47,090 --> 03:44:47,649
Sorry, guys.

3773
03:44:58,500 --> 03:45:02,370
I mean, that's up there, isn't it?

3774
03:45:03,090 --> 03:45:08,399
Maybe the 70-foot plateau wasn't necessary.

3775
03:45:10,389 --> 03:45:13,430
No, it really wasn't, but this was already here,

3776
03:45:13,430 --> 03:45:14,469
and I thought it might have been cool.

3777
03:45:17,649 --> 03:45:18,770
Pave over the people.

3778
03:45:18,770 --> 03:45:19,489
Can they get up now?

3779
03:45:20,129 --> 03:45:22,440
I don't know.

3780
03:45:22,440 --> 03:45:22,920
I can't tell.

3781
03:45:23,879 --> 03:45:25,079
That looks pretty flush.

3782
03:45:25,719 --> 03:45:26,120
We'll see.

3783
03:45:26,760 --> 03:45:28,930
No, they're bumping into the...

3784
03:45:28,930 --> 03:45:29,969
This is not going to work.

3785
03:45:29,969 --> 03:45:32,690
They're bumping into the lip here when they come up.

3786
03:45:49,969 --> 03:45:50,530
That's all right.

3787
03:45:51,090 --> 03:45:55,239
No, it's not going to work.

3788
03:46:28,370 --> 03:46:29,010
All right, fixed it.

3789
03:46:29,569 --> 03:46:49,860
Does it work?

3790
03:46:49,860 --> 03:46:57,829
I think so.

3791
03:46:57,829 --> 03:46:58,950
Now it's steeper than before,

3792
03:46:58,950 --> 03:47:00,790
but now at least they can cross it.

3793
03:47:03,569 --> 03:47:04,930
The beavers are dying.

3794
03:47:04,930 --> 03:47:11,510
Look, I just don't think...

3795
03:47:11,510 --> 03:47:12,950
I don't think they're smart enough to understand.

3796
03:47:13,590 --> 03:47:17,299
Well, this is actually a much better view of the exhibit.

3797
03:47:17,299 --> 03:47:18,260
Maybe this is a good idea.

3798
03:47:18,979 --> 03:47:19,940
You can see over the fence.

3799
03:47:22,840 --> 03:47:23,959
No, people are going up and down.

3800
03:47:28,549 --> 03:47:29,430
Rescue these people.

3801
03:47:29,989 --> 03:47:33,360
Just make it go into the enclosure,

3802
03:47:34,159 --> 03:47:36,290
but just drop off into the enclosure.

3803
03:47:37,010 --> 03:47:45,559
For the path around the whale sharks.

3804
03:47:46,520 --> 03:47:48,159
Look at how far that is, though.

3805
03:47:48,159 --> 03:47:50,159
I have to put that up here and then go around.

3806
03:47:51,959 --> 03:47:52,760
No one is...

3807
03:47:52,760 --> 03:47:53,719
No one's even coming over here.

3808
03:47:54,280 --> 03:47:56,280
Is this some educational thing?

3809
03:47:56,280 --> 03:47:56,680
Hold on.

3810
03:47:57,399 --> 03:48:07,600
Yeah, I need a donation machine as well.

3811
03:48:08,479 --> 03:48:14,479
Okay.

3812
03:48:15,200 --> 03:48:17,350
Then nobody cares that this exists.

3813
03:48:24,680 --> 03:48:25,319
Hold on.

3814
03:48:25,319 --> 03:48:26,040
I'll try it.

3815
03:48:26,040 --> 03:48:26,760
All right, fine.

3816
03:48:27,319 --> 03:48:33,799
This game's fun, though.

3817
03:48:34,360 --> 03:48:36,229
There's a fun game.

3818
03:48:36,870 --> 03:48:42,180
Connect the path to the ladder.

3819
03:48:42,819 --> 03:48:53,159
Is that really what was preventing people from going over here?

3820
03:49:05,190 --> 03:49:07,110
For a second, I thought this person's name was Quindelius.

3821
03:49:17,559 --> 03:49:27,190
Uh, a little angry.

3822
03:49:27,190 --> 03:49:31,360
He's waving to the sharks.

3823
03:49:31,360 --> 03:49:32,799
Is this guy just part of the exhibit now?

3824
03:49:33,360 --> 03:49:45,799
He's not even scared.

3825
03:49:45,799 --> 03:49:48,370
I'm gonna get a donation here.

3826
03:49:49,559 --> 03:49:51,430
Maybe.

3827
03:49:51,430 --> 03:49:53,540
He just pet the shark.

3828
03:49:53,540 --> 03:49:55,780
This is the crazy guy that comes to the aquarium.

3829
03:49:55,780 --> 03:49:56,719
He dives in.

3830
03:49:58,520 --> 03:49:59,879
He actually touched the shark.

3831
03:49:59,879 --> 03:50:00,360
He did it.

3832
03:50:01,559 --> 03:50:03,639
I can't see any animals from here.

3833
03:50:03,639 --> 03:50:12,819
He's just swimming.

3834
03:50:12,819 --> 03:50:14,739
This guy's a pretty damn good swimmer.

3835
03:50:24,520 --> 03:50:35,719
All right, well, let me come in there.

3836
03:50:35,719 --> 03:50:36,360
Can I dive?

3837
03:50:44,209 --> 03:50:45,170
It's kind of relaxing.

3838
03:50:46,229 --> 03:50:52,360
I'm kind of just relaxed.

3839
03:50:52,360 --> 03:50:54,360
Everybody else is feeling, like, relaxed right now.

3840
03:50:54,920 --> 03:51:03,489
He's like, whatever.

3841
03:51:03,489 --> 03:51:12,450
He did a T-pose.

3842
03:51:12,450 --> 03:51:13,809
He did not do a T-pose.

3843
03:51:15,760 --> 03:51:17,600
Well, it's about to get far less relaxing.

3844
03:51:17,600 --> 03:51:18,079
I'm sorry.

3845
03:51:18,079 --> 03:51:41,329
Are we gonna get a Jaws scenario?

3846
03:51:41,969 --> 03:51:42,530
It's possible.

3847
03:51:53,440 --> 03:52:00,260
Oh, my God.

3848
03:52:00,260 --> 03:52:01,379
He's okay.

3849
03:52:01,379 --> 03:52:03,600
He's not injured.

3850
03:52:03,600 --> 03:52:04,879
He's actually not injured.

3851
03:52:04,879 --> 03:52:05,680
He just doesn't even care.

3852
03:52:05,680 --> 03:52:06,879
He just puts his hands up.

3853
03:52:07,440 --> 03:52:08,479
Ah, whatever.

3854
03:52:08,479 --> 03:52:10,239
It's still kind of fun in here.

3855
03:52:17,590 --> 03:52:18,469
It picked him up.

3856
03:52:19,030 --> 03:52:19,670
In his mouth.

3857
03:52:20,399 --> 03:52:20,799
That's it.

3858
03:52:21,440 --> 03:52:24,159
And bit down really, really, really fucking hard.

3859
03:52:31,620 --> 03:52:32,579
He's yawning.

3860
03:52:32,579 --> 03:52:33,379
All right.

3861
03:52:33,379 --> 03:52:33,620
Good.

3862
03:52:34,180 --> 03:52:52,399
This is what Bill Crazy would do voluntarily.

3863
03:52:52,399 --> 03:52:52,959
Yeah.

3864
03:52:52,959 --> 03:52:59,459
Where is the whale shark?

3865
03:52:59,459 --> 03:53:01,809
Or any shark, for that matter.

3866
03:53:13,700 --> 03:53:23,670
Okay.

3867
03:53:23,670 --> 03:53:41,200
Let's see how you handle that now.

3868
03:53:41,200 --> 03:53:43,280
That is fucking terrifying.

3869
03:53:43,280 --> 03:53:46,020
My God.

3870
03:53:46,020 --> 03:53:48,520
Look below.

3871
03:53:48,520 --> 03:53:49,959
Oh, my goodness.

3872
03:53:49,959 --> 03:53:52,389
I wouldn't do this for a hundred million dollars.

3873
03:53:53,110 --> 03:54:03,299
The notifications are playing the Jaws theme.

3874
03:54:04,600 --> 03:54:12,870
What's this?

3875
03:54:18,950 --> 03:54:24,629
The notifications are playing the Jaws theme.

3876
03:54:25,590 --> 03:54:28,399
That's fucking so funny.

3877
03:54:34,450 --> 03:54:48,709
Um, I don't know what else.

3878
03:54:48,709 --> 03:54:49,510
I don't know how to do.

3879
03:54:51,670 --> 03:54:55,350
Where'd he go?

3880
03:54:55,350 --> 03:54:57,139
Where'd he go?

3881
03:54:57,139 --> 03:54:57,540
Where'd he go?

3882
03:54:57,540 --> 03:54:58,420
Where'd he go?

3883
03:54:58,420 --> 03:54:59,620
Did he get out?

3884
03:55:00,180 --> 03:55:19,399
Oh, fuck.

3885
03:55:19,399 --> 03:55:22,370
This might actually be bad for the computer.

3886
03:55:22,370 --> 03:55:22,610
No, no.

3887
03:55:22,610 --> 03:55:23,889
It should be bad for my computer.

3888
03:55:24,770 --> 03:55:26,950
How do I take care of this?

3889
03:55:26,950 --> 03:55:50,180
I don't know.

3890
03:55:50,180 --> 03:55:50,739
Coffins.

3891
03:55:51,379 --> 03:56:23,920
I'm trying to hold on.

3892
03:56:23,920 --> 03:56:25,520
Is this what I'm doing in the game right now?

3893
03:56:27,879 --> 03:56:28,840
It is, isn't it?

3894
03:56:28,840 --> 03:56:41,969
No, this is going to take so long.

3895
03:56:42,610 --> 03:56:44,850
I was about to write out each shit in their coffins.

3896
03:56:46,479 --> 03:56:47,760
No, just like, just sell them.

3897
03:56:52,120 --> 03:56:52,760
I can't sell.

3898
03:56:52,760 --> 03:56:53,639
That's not, that's it.

3899
03:56:53,639 --> 03:56:54,600
No, put it back in.

3900
03:56:54,600 --> 03:56:55,079
He's fine.

3901
03:57:03,010 --> 03:57:28,159
Uh, put him in the lake with the beavers.

3902
03:57:28,159 --> 03:57:45,360
I'm not going to show you that.

3903
03:57:45,360 --> 03:57:46,079
What have I done?

3904
03:57:46,799 --> 03:57:51,479
Well, did I save it somewhere before that fucking weirdo got in the water?

3905
03:57:52,120 --> 03:57:54,610
I got jumped through the water.

3906
03:57:54,610 --> 03:57:56,360
Like, what are you doing?

3907
03:57:56,360 --> 03:58:09,200
Fucking beaver scenario again.

3908
03:58:09,200 --> 03:58:16,639
All right, that's good.

3909
03:58:16,639 --> 03:58:23,319
Now the bridge is messed up again.

3910
03:58:24,200 --> 03:58:27,010
Well, then it's time.

3911
03:58:28,709 --> 03:58:33,190
Hold on.

3912
03:58:33,190 --> 03:58:35,940
Is there any, what are the animals I want to play around with?

3913
03:58:35,940 --> 03:58:38,319
Is there anything else I want to do?

3914
03:58:41,280 --> 03:58:43,920
I could just put penguins in until the game crashes.

3915
03:58:44,479 --> 03:58:47,959
Like until my computer physically like turns off.

3916
03:58:56,659 --> 03:58:57,059
All right.

3917
03:58:57,059 --> 03:59:05,399
Let's, uh, the penguins or, it needs to be small enough where I can put a lot of them.

3918
03:59:06,040 --> 03:59:09,649
And then put a t-rex right in the middle.

3919
03:59:12,479 --> 03:59:13,200
Yeah, I like that.

3920
03:59:13,920 --> 03:59:19,569
Yeah, let's get, let's get a new, let's get a clean slate here.

3921
03:59:19,569 --> 03:59:39,360
On a flat ground, a small in loves this music.

3922
03:59:39,360 --> 03:59:40,159
It's so great.

3923
03:59:41,120 --> 03:59:52,530
Sour pleased.

3924
03:59:52,530 --> 03:59:54,520
I've seen a lot of sour pleases.

3925
03:59:56,309 --> 03:59:56,629
All right.

3926
03:59:56,629 --> 04:00:00,770
Let's see if we can turn my computer into dust.

3927
04:00:01,569 --> 04:00:04,399
Let's flatten everything out.

3928
04:00:05,040 --> 04:00:06,959
I need a bigger brush size than that.

3929
04:00:07,920 --> 04:00:12,100
As big as it can be.

3930
04:00:12,899 --> 04:00:19,399
It's going to be one exhibit only.

3931
04:00:20,120 --> 04:00:33,520
We're not even going to get this far here.

3932
04:00:34,319 --> 04:00:35,959
Not that looks good.

3933
04:00:37,959 --> 04:00:40,120
So where is the penguin?

3934
04:00:42,770 --> 04:00:43,170
All right.

3935
04:00:43,170 --> 04:00:44,209
Rockhopper penguin.

3936
04:00:44,209 --> 04:00:44,770
How big are you?

3937
04:00:45,489 --> 04:00:46,950
Kind of small.

3938
04:00:47,590 --> 04:00:48,469
Uh, emperor penguin.

3939
04:00:50,579 --> 04:00:51,379
Start in the corner.

3940
04:01:13,409 --> 04:01:14,209
This is going to be bad.

3941
04:01:15,409 --> 04:01:17,250
This is going to stop in about five seconds.

3942
04:01:19,170 --> 04:01:26,870
I'm just creating the opening scene from Happy Feet.

3943
04:01:55,760 --> 04:01:58,549
How was my day?

3944
04:01:58,549 --> 04:01:59,030
It was good.

3945
04:01:59,909 --> 04:02:01,239
Just kind of relaxing.

3946
04:02:01,239 --> 04:02:04,200
Just having a chill day today.

3947
04:02:18,399 --> 04:02:19,520
They're not all dudes.

3948
04:02:20,159 --> 04:02:20,639
Look, see?

3949
04:02:30,239 --> 04:02:31,440
You want me to go faster than that?

3950
04:02:34,209 --> 04:02:40,040
Well, I can do it.

3951
04:02:40,040 --> 04:02:40,520
I can do it.

3952
04:02:40,520 --> 04:02:40,840
I can do it.

3953
04:02:40,840 --> 04:02:41,159
Hold on.

3954
04:02:41,159 --> 04:02:41,639
I can do it.

3955
04:02:41,639 --> 04:02:42,200
I can do it.

3956
04:02:43,000 --> 04:02:44,180
Nobody move.

3957
04:02:57,430 --> 04:02:57,989
Don't move.

3958
04:03:09,920 --> 04:03:10,719
No, they're moving.

3959
04:03:11,520 --> 04:03:23,989
This hurts already.

3960
04:03:25,270 --> 04:03:32,659
Eat salt.

3961
04:03:33,620 --> 04:03:34,819
No, not eat salt.

3962
04:03:44,549 --> 04:03:51,479
Let's get down to ground level.

3963
04:03:52,120 --> 04:04:04,079
This is fucking dumb.

3964
04:04:04,079 --> 04:04:06,000
I don't know why I thought this was going to be interesting.

3965
04:04:07,940 --> 04:04:09,139
And presents for everybody.

3966
04:04:10,340 --> 04:04:17,510
I was speaking of presents.

3967
04:04:19,030 --> 04:04:21,719
You, uh, Mr. Peanut.

3968
04:04:23,959 --> 04:04:28,309
On Christmas Eve, it's going to be a stream.

3969
04:04:30,450 --> 04:04:31,489
I don't think you're going to want to miss.

3970
04:04:32,129 --> 04:04:38,069
Christmas Eve is the day that the absolutely wonderful Christmas special will be.

3971
04:04:43,940 --> 04:04:44,819
Elf bowling.

3972
04:04:44,819 --> 04:04:45,299
What, what, what?

3973
04:04:45,299 --> 04:04:46,340
What did I do this for again?

3974
04:04:47,139 --> 04:04:52,319
Oh yeah, put like five tigers in.

3975
04:04:57,319 --> 04:05:01,319
Florida Panther in the middle of the tundra.

3976
04:05:03,000 --> 04:05:15,700
Florida in winter.

3977
04:05:16,420 --> 04:05:19,780
We'll lose enough.

3978
04:05:21,319 --> 04:05:22,840
What are those sounds?

3979
04:05:23,639 --> 04:05:24,760
That's a lion sound.

3980
04:05:31,090 --> 04:05:32,209
That doesn't sound like a lion.

3981
04:05:32,850 --> 04:05:34,049
No, that's the penguin.

3982
04:05:34,770 --> 04:05:36,370
Why are they going to the presents?

3983
04:05:42,129 --> 04:05:43,250
They don't care about the penguins.

3984
04:05:43,250 --> 04:05:44,690
They just want to open the presents.

3985
04:05:57,520 --> 04:06:02,719
Oh, he's inside of one.

3986
04:06:05,319 --> 04:06:07,409
It's a birthday party.

3987
04:06:07,409 --> 04:06:08,690
This did not go as planned.

3988
04:06:09,250 --> 04:06:09,729
Oh, well.

3989
04:06:24,819 --> 04:06:25,620
Oh my God.

3990
04:06:26,579 --> 04:06:31,600
My amazable play.

3991
04:06:31,600 --> 04:06:35,120
Well, I'm going to play that epic battle simulator.

3992
04:06:35,120 --> 04:06:36,799
Like that's what I'm trying to do right now.

3993
04:06:37,440 --> 04:06:56,870
Okay.

3994
04:06:56,870 --> 04:06:58,549
Let's see how angry that makes everybody.

3995
04:06:59,350 --> 04:07:04,239
What do they get to meet?

3996
04:07:09,190 --> 04:07:10,389
Just playing sport.

3997
04:07:11,809 --> 04:07:16,739
Have I really been in this game for four hours?

3998
04:07:16,739 --> 04:07:17,540
Holy shit.

3999
04:07:18,420 --> 04:07:28,819
I just groomed a fish.

4000
04:07:39,280 --> 04:07:40,000
All right.

4001
04:07:40,000 --> 04:07:41,120
I think we've peaked here.

4002
04:07:41,920 --> 04:07:51,379
It's time to open the zoo.

4003
04:07:51,940 --> 04:07:52,579
That's right.

4004
04:07:53,600 --> 04:07:54,639
Come on in, everybody.

4005
04:07:55,600 --> 04:07:56,959
What the fuck are they doing?

4006
04:07:57,760 --> 04:08:00,389
What are you doing over here?

4007
04:08:16,719 --> 04:08:17,280
Come on in.

4008
04:08:17,280 --> 04:08:18,479
It already is open.

4009
04:08:18,479 --> 04:08:20,959
People looking over the railing and going, no thanks.

4010
04:08:21,920 --> 04:08:26,000
Club Penguin.

4011
04:08:28,840 --> 04:08:30,280
Wait, whoa, he just dove in.

4012
04:08:32,200 --> 04:08:33,479
This guy just dove in here.

4013
04:08:36,149 --> 04:08:37,350
What is going on in the center?

4014
04:08:37,989 --> 04:08:52,180
All right.

4015
04:08:52,180 --> 04:08:52,659
Water bowl.

4016
04:08:59,860 --> 04:09:00,899
They're all stuck on each other.

4017
04:09:00,899 --> 04:09:01,379
They can't move.

4018
04:09:07,969 --> 04:09:09,090
Put a cage around them.

4019
04:09:09,090 --> 04:09:09,969
No, that's cruel.

4020
04:09:16,659 --> 04:09:17,379
This one's dead.

4021
04:09:18,020 --> 04:09:22,979
No, no one's eating anybody.

4022
04:09:22,979 --> 04:09:25,299
They're just sleeping and playing with presents

4023
04:09:25,299 --> 04:09:27,379
and having birthday parties and not doing anything else.

4024
04:09:36,579 --> 04:09:36,899
All right.

4025
04:09:36,899 --> 04:09:37,620
That's it for that.

4026
04:09:44,549 --> 04:09:45,430
Sell the fish.

4027
04:09:49,000 --> 04:09:56,450
Zoo Tycoon 1 has more murder.

4028
04:09:59,729 --> 04:10:00,610
More murder.

4029
04:10:06,469 --> 04:10:16,610
What time does the Red Dead beta start tomorrow?

4030
04:10:16,610 --> 04:10:17,649
Anybody know?

4031
04:10:25,190 --> 04:10:27,510
That's the end of the stream voice coming up here.

4032
04:10:32,850 --> 04:10:39,440
It's just out.

4033
04:10:39,440 --> 04:10:41,440
The end of the stream voice.

4034
04:10:50,229 --> 04:10:50,879
Let me see.

4035
04:10:51,520 --> 04:11:00,500
Boomer Streamer is tired at 8 PM.

4036
04:11:00,500 --> 04:11:01,860
No, no, that's not what it is.

4037
04:11:08,899 --> 04:11:10,340
What can I do for another hour or so?

4038
04:11:10,899 --> 04:11:14,049
Because I can't play Red Dead.

4039
04:11:14,049 --> 04:11:15,329
I want to do that tomorrow.

4040
04:11:15,329 --> 04:11:17,190
So Red Dead will be tomorrow.

4041
04:11:18,520 --> 04:11:21,190
And then Friday.

4042
04:11:24,629 --> 04:11:27,510
Oh, yeah, I think I might do Dreamcast on Friday.

4043
04:11:28,309 --> 04:11:29,110
I might pull it out.

4044
04:11:41,079 --> 04:11:41,559
Red Dead.

4045
04:11:41,559 --> 04:11:43,319
Yeah, you know, I could play single player in Red Dead

4046
04:11:43,319 --> 04:11:44,200
to prepare for tomorrow.

4047
04:11:45,000 --> 04:11:47,799
But I don't know.

4048
04:11:48,520 --> 04:11:49,159
Hey, let me do this.

4049
04:11:49,159 --> 04:11:49,479
Let me grab.

4050
04:11:49,479 --> 04:11:50,360
I'm going to let me.

4051
04:11:50,360 --> 04:11:52,360
It's been like four and a half hours almost.

4052
04:11:52,360 --> 04:11:55,139
Let me grab a water and I'll be right back.

4053
04:11:56,229 --> 04:11:57,829
And we can figure out what the hell we're going to do.

4054
04:11:58,469 --> 04:12:01,000
See you in a second.
