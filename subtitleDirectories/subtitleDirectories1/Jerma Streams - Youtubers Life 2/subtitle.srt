1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:04,919
I'm on time. What are you talking about?

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,689
A lot of you guys just sit here and wait till 201.

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:14,759
Just start spamming me. How you doing? What's up?

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,730
This isn't movie night. No, that's...

5
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,410
That's next weekend.

6
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,170
I'm gonna give you the schedule. Just hold on.

7
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,530
How are my balls doing?

8
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,060
Weird question to start with, but...

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,500
They're doing alright.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,420
No spooky games this Halloween.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,079
Well, we're gonna change it up this year.

12
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,880
Instead of playing spooky games around Halloween time,

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,799
we're gonna watch horror public domain movies.

14
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,289
We're gonna watch old scary movies from like 1950, 1930.

15
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,619
That's what Public Domain Movie Night 2 is all about.

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,620
That stream, I'll give you a little bit of time to prepare for that

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,739
in case you don't want to miss it.

18
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,819
It's gonna be the 30th.

19
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,140
Not streaming on Halloween this year for the first time.

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,469
And probably, well, it's been a long time.

21
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:26,140
I'm streaming the day before Halloween.

22
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,079
Not streaming on Halloween night.

23
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,659
I need to go trick or treating.

24
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:34,219
That's right.

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,739
And I don't go back in until my pillowcase is full.

26
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,000
See the people walking around with the little buckets

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,079
that can hold like 12 pieces of candy?

28
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,480
Ah, excuse me.

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,620
No, no, you walk around...

30
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,459
The guy that has a stick with the knapsack on it.

31
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,010
You just walk around until you fill the whole bag.

32
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,050
You get only coal, you weirdo.

33
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,169
This is if it's not Christmas.

34
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,180
Imagine somebody opened the door.

35
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,939
You're like, oh trick or treat.

36
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,219
And they opened the door, they had fucking, like a Christmas hat on.

37
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,139
The guy comes out, he's like oh ohoho how laid, kids!

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,180
Oh hey, Mr. Stevenson, how are you?

39
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,900
These you're kids?

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,819
And you see this guy drops coal in all the kids' bags.

41
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,800
Oh, this is not for you, this is for your dad over there.

42
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,360
He keeps letting the dog shit on the lawn.

43
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,159
You go give that to him.

44
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:55,330
All right, give me one second. I'll be right back starting soon. You're so funny

45
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,569
Thank you. I'll be right back. I

47
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:17,259
It's it's like before every stream. It's like the intro to home alone in here. I'm running all over the place. I'm gonna find everything

48
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:32,860
Like the channels live and I'm looking for my phone. I'm sprinting around that electrocuted tweet now

49
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,819
I know that's what I was doing

50
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:40,100
I'm gonna get my phone so I can tweet stream overwatch. What what the fuck would I do that for?

51
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,509
All right, give me give me a second. I'll be right back

52
00:05:46,550 --> 00:06:35,389

53
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:42,290

54
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:58,959
But hello. How are you? Good to see you. They smite. No

60
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:44,870

That's not even is that correct then that doesn't have letters on that keyboard. Where's a what is this keyboard?

63
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:27,069

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,940
Appeared on my screen. Well, what if I was naked what we just saw was somebody playing a game

Just sitting in their room with the lights off. What if I was just sitting here naked or so like get out of here

Downtown or the port. Let's get this right

78
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,360
Why are you always naked because it's natural way to live especially in your own house

79
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,019
I don't think I think clothes

80
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:16,789
Honestly clothes like if I'm gonna go anywhere sure but to like dress up to be in my own like place

81
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,000
There's like nobody around what I'm not gonna put a suit and tie on

82
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:26,340
Why would I do that? So you guys all question mark me and call me a weirdo

83
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:37,799
But I do way less laundry than you do guaranteed app. I guarantee it. All right downtown get a haircut

84
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:44,940
You don't know what hair looks like. You don't even how do you know what my hair looks like right now?

85
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,740
What are you talking about? All right

86
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:55,690
Do you want to go downtown the high-tech neighborhood known for its video game stores PC component stores in a gym chill out neighborhood

87
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,529
It's the most modern one and it's known for its hairdressers

88
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:08,120
Beach restaurants and the members only club or City Hall the most traditional neighborhood it stands out for its luxury stores and restaurant

89
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,940
Traveling fair and the City Hall. There's only one restaurant here stands up for its luxury stores and its restaurant

90
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,690
Okay, I don't I count about more than one restaurant go downtown

91
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:31,230
I would oh good. This guy's been peeking over my shoulder the whole time. I'm good choice

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,919
Like a fucking headband and like a white t-shirt. All right, create your character body type

94
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,399
Okay, that's fine. That looks fine eyes

95
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:11,720
Where's my slate blue eyes? They don't have them. You're a ten-year-old Pokemon character creator

96
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:19,909
What would you guys say is more like my eyes I think it's these ones all right facial features

97
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:31,889
I thought these are big thick eyebrows a lightning bolt. It's a big scar. Oh

98
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:59,120
Is there facial hair? What about mouth? What's the difference? I got a big mouth. Oh, man

99
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:09,620
I like this one because it's just so it's so weird looking. It doesn't it just looks wrong. It just looks odd

100
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:28,000
All right hairstyle. This looks like those Funko pops the

101
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:38,220
Unedited Andy you talking about unedited Andy. Why are you saying unedited Andy?

102
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,350
that's a really fun word to say though out loud say it out loud close your eyes and

103
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:51,090
Just say unedited unedited. There's a lot of like D's and E's and the consonants bounce unedited

104
00:13:51,610 --> 00:14:09,539
Unedited you want to go with the default go with this one. It's too much fucking work to have here be like that

105
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,590
It's just is all right. Let me be really honest. Hold on a minute. Let me just clear my throat

106
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:17,690
Comes a boomer take it's too much work to hear like this

107
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:24,559
You should just have to be flopping over on the side of a really it's like take so this like takes like an hour

108
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,559
I do this. It's too much

109
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,309
That's fine. Whatever

110
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:36,210
I want cool glasses

111
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:46,399
No, not really. No, not really. No

112
00:14:47,639 --> 00:15:01,960
Actually, maybe I kind of want this I'm gonna keep it a for Andy

113
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,480
Stop saying Andy just because I say it like once every few weeks doesn't mean we have to say but everything has to be Andy

114
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,129
headphones

115
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,649
No, I don't know

116
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:23,799
No, no, I have yeah have fun wearing this and then have your ears hurt. It's painful to fucking touch them

117
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,379
This is great though. Let's have huge headphones

118
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:33,820
I don't know why that became a thing you wear these things for more than an hour and you'll take them off and it's like

119
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:46,889
Ow and if you touch your hair touches your ears, it's like fuck that hurts. I don't understand these that's true

120
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,389
I got I saw at least two truths. Thank you

121
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:57,250
I don't want to wear those guys don't you understand as long as one person says true in the chat

122
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:06,120
I am correct. See, no, I don't this is not nothing

123
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,620
I would ever put on a but let me give you some advice. Well, this is not a device

124
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,929
This is before you think I'm a weirdo a button-up shirt like this

125
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:20,700
I would you don't wear that to like go get coffee at Starbucks

126
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:26,970
I wouldn't the amount of time it takes to button those four buttons is too much time for me to go get like a coffee

127
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:34,960
Now if I was if there was like a event I was going to or if it was like a work thing or something

128
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:43,940
Yeah, that's just too much. It's too much time. Maybe I'm just a weirdo, which I mean, maybe I am

129
00:16:44,179 --> 00:17:00,759
There we go. Not too much time. Just a jacket. It's a little weird. Just put the seashells on. No, that's that's too wacky

130
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,759
I don't want it. I don't that's way too wacky

131
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:14,529
They just have like a pac-man t-shirt with wicked stained underarms like stained yellow underarms with like just a white t-shirt with stained

132
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:39,049
Underarms, where is that? This will do. All right, and like like a bathing suit. I wear jeans

133
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:44,500
I do I wear jeans or shorts. That's pretty

134
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:56,809
That's almost too put together. You know, I mean like the white tee and the jeans is almost like you're doing that on purpose

135
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:14,519
It's too put together. There we go. All right, that looks good. What's wrong with nothing? Just put an X. Wait, what?

136
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,819
Oh my god, you can

137
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:27,250
Wait, you can't right? I mean, uh, why would you be I'm not gonna walk around like this

138
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:33,619
The alright, this is my actual real attire every day

139
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:38,059
I swear to god, it's what I currently am I have pretty much on right now

140
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:43,839
This is just how I live every day in my privacy of my own place

141
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,819
If I was to make a video on YouTube, but this would be my outfit

142
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:52,019
That's what that's what I would be wearing right now. I wouldn't wear the sneakers though

143
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:59,140
It'd be big big white tube socks like your dad wears I don't wear those either they cut off circulation in my legs

144
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,960
That's a lie. I don't believe that

145
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,579
Yeah, this is it. This is literally what I wear every day

146
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm starting to become like more aware of this now

147
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,990
But yeah, like just flip-flops a pair of shorts and nothing

148
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:23,420
This is what I wear every day, but the sunglasses aren't accurate, but then we're doing that for fun

149
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:37,720
It's very beachy, isn't it? I don't I live on a beach or something. I don't want to do that

150
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:43,829
My attire every day is like you should be in like the tropics

151
00:19:44,250 --> 00:20:01,599
Okay, new tube after like sign up or sign in or something. Oh, that's that's my contact. That's the zoom hacker

I don't like the way you worded that that seems strange the way to say that

154
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:19,269
How about like welcome to new tube city welcome home or something from now on if I want to leave?

164
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:34,279

197
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,119
What a nice name David. Would you like to test me out now? Yes

198
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:02,730
I'm intrigued. This is a recording point for you to record videos

199
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,869
You can find points like this one around the city. I can do IRL videos

200
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:18,930
Okay, use the recording point to record your first introductory vlog for the channel. You don't start with a vlog. I'll record you. Okay

201
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:31,039
Record your first vlog. You don't start with a vlog. Let's go record. I have a microphone

202
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:48,119
This is dead. I'm gonna edit this part out. This is dead air. Am I recording? Am I new subscribers?

203
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,049
How do I record?

204
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:55,569
Said anything

205
00:26:55,569 --> 00:27:05,299
Actually, you know what this probably get a lot of views because it's fucking weird. How do I do anything Ohm vlog

206
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:12,930
Which camera this one? Oh

207
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:21,319
Okay, you start recording and you shyly say hello. You're full of energy. Hey, what's going on everybody?

208
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,279
You go on and on and then you let out a what the fuck you flatter yourself

209
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:35,809
Oh, you make a bad joke. You let out what WTF you pout and you're in chill mode

210
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,190
Dronekilla tube is losing battery you ask for a subscriber

211
00:27:43,329 --> 00:28:01,519
But my cameras out of battery. I beg for subscribers. Okay, you're my clips. I watch them

212
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,650
activate chill mode

213
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:18,450
Okay, this is a normie germa. Well, you didn't say that you said normal beep beep nice acting David

214
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:30,460
I mean acting as well as it wasn't a vlog. We who's acting on a vlog first

215
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
We'll touch it up a bit by editing on your computer

216
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:41,559
What if I don't want this is not how this works

217
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,859
I have to make like 30 of these in a row before I decide which one I actually want to use

218
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:58,160
Okay vlog recording trends. Okay vlog this tool is the video editor

219
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,759
You can use it to edit your videos and finish giving them your personal touch

220
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,599
Okay, the goal is to get as many points as possible. Make sure the clips connect to each other

221
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,599
Well, I'm gonna fuck this whole thing up

222
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,980
If you manage to connect them from the start to the end of the video

223
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,759
You'll get a juicy bonus later when you have a better PC with more rendering points

224
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,789
You'll be able to buy video effects and use them in your clips to boost your edits even more and now I'll let the creative genius

225
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:34,190
Unleash his imagination. All right, I don't know what the context of these clips even is I like see this

226
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:41,740
Oh, they have like connecting points. This is so stupid

227
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,119
Okay, this is just like a puzzle. I

228
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:56,170
Need a connector here. I

229
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:06,730
Can't I editing videos is hard. What do I start with this one? It's the pipe game

230
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:21,349
I don't think I can even connect these can I I have enough pieces to do this

231
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:43,619
I don't think I have enough pieces to do this. Who cares just go in order. I don't care

232
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:55,119
I don't think you can do it choose the video's thumbnail. They're all the same. Everything's the same video bad video

233
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:23,900
She's clickbait phrase if this was accurate if this is accurate. This person has no idea what they're doing

234
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:31,579
Okay, that looks good dot web M. I

235
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:43,400
Can't I can't add anything to it. It's fine. I like this title. Why can I publish video? Yeah, let's go include the date stamp

236
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:55,619
Oh shit, that's right video posted final score. Oh, no, you're not famous yet. You did one video. What the fuck?

237
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,099
What the hell just what now?

238
00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:58,980
It's not worth it

239
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:04,619
PP grab your phone and install the new tube app

240
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:11,289
Check the video you just post and see other youtubers ranking in the city your goal gain loads of subscribers

241
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:16,259
Okay, check out the new tube app. Yeah

242
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:29,900
Okay, my profile journal contacts new tube your latest videos my ranking one video published three likes

243
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:40,619
It was me at least one of those is me. You guys have to understand something when you're starting out

244
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:48,140
I remember like 10 plus years ago. I remember the proportion of likes to dislikes where

245
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,299
It's when you have three or four likes and even one or two dislikes. That's a potential 50%

246
00:32:55,819 --> 00:33:02,180
Ratio one dislike here is world-changing. I remember when that used to happen

247
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:08,339
I would have a video go up and it would be like 30 40 likes and there would be like two or three dislikes and I'd be

248
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:10,980
That's fucking world-ending. That's such a huge percentage

249
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:22,980
Zero views where you see zero views. Oh shit. There's no views

250
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:33,190
Okay, let's go back. All right, so I have this my cats are trending

251
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,819
deity of war honey play studios one and adventure games

252
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:52,339
All right, we need to have a cat in the video. All right, did you know that I can also record it commentary scripts on the computer?

253
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:56,549
Scripts are a type of video. I don't know how to record without them

254
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,190
Xavier says there's a load of them hidden around the city

255
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:05,930
Have to go plagiarize people every time you record with a script you improve its quality and this is how you get better clips

256
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:11,639
And scores shall we try a commentary video to see if you get the first 30 subscribers to your channel

257
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:31,559
Okay, I just go around and like take steal scripts from trash cans. Let's go 30 subs. I can do it commentary. Let's go

258
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,050
Why am I like

259
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,050
Using mind like powers

260
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,550
To start the video

261
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:49,150
Shyly say hello poltergeist appears and a poltergeist appears where you have a laughing fit

262
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,849
that's what I would do you go on and on and then

263
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:07,199
Let's get into chill mode here again. I don't know if somebody likes this and it's over you asked for subscribers and it's over

264
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:14,360
All right. We're gonna have to sign off we go

265
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,719
All right, save

266
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:29,289
Remember that you need to edit and post the video on the computer. Here's a commentary. Oh fuck people gonna think I'm so stupid

267
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:39,659
I'm not supposed to go in order. Okay, so this one has the down down. I can't connect these

268
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:51,750
There's no way I can possibly connect all these just go in order. There's there's no what do you mean?

269
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:56,199
You're not supposed to connect all of them. Oh

270
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,809
Okay

271
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:06,130
Does that get double points get as many connections as possible and not just put them all on there?

272
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:12,530
Okay, hold on. Can I get more like this?

273
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:25,079
Now it has to start with this because it's red. All right, there you go

274
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:34,659
Well, how's this worse editing 1 2 3 4 this 1 1 1 2 there's no 1 2 3 4 it's 1 1 1 2

275
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:38,489
What do you see 1 2 3 4?

276
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:52,340
1 1 1 2. Oh, that's 14 14

277
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,480
You have to get to the 10-minute mark so you get the post roll

278
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:06,010
No, I had it right the first time see that's good. That's good enough. Oh, this is stupid

279
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:13,909
Video where I'm sitting naked just fucking saying hi to people. This one is 30 points

280
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:15,949
I try I connected the three and it was like 20

281
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:23,800
I can what best kept youtubers secret by adding effects to your clips

282
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:30,639
You can make your video to the stratosphere excuse render points, but you'll have to update the editor and buy them first

283
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:44,789
Oh, I only have a hundred render points. I can't do anything about this. Let me just see what happens if I do this

284
00:37:45,550 --> 00:38:09,389
18 see the other one was better. See I know what I'm doing. You're a washed-up youtuber. You're never gonna hit it big

285
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,829
No

286
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:20,539
Probably not anymore. If I started those TF2 videos now people just think I was a fucking moron

287
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:30,480
I sure did luck out on that one. All right title. No what video?

288
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,519
Excuse me. I think my videos were very interesting and interesting topics. I don't get me wrong. I love all my videos

289
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:54,800
They're all my children. All right title who cares

290
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:02,469
This is how you make the best commentary with hashtag home. I play like the metadata

291
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,030
Should I put hashtag cats but that no this stuff never works

292
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:12,559
If you put hashtag cats in here and it's a trending topic people come to the channel and they say there's no cat here

293
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:27,670
This guy's a dick. I hate this guy as they make people hate you. I was like

294
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,349
Oh, man, you gotta make sure you're like tags are really like really pull viewers and shit

295
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:35,309
They'll just lie to people and everyone hates me after like a month

296
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:49,039
How would I do that? That was better than the last one. Thank you. I got subs

297
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,059
Holy shit 30 scripted video game subscribers that give them to you in the very beginning to go through the tutorial to make sure you

298
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,460
Get to over a hundred

299
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,599
Ring, it's already midnight. It's time to go to bed

300
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,239
Sleeping helps you get back your energy and progress to the next day

301
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:12,690
You can stay awake until 4 a.m. You won't be able to get all your energy back for the next day. Good night, David

302
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:18,489
I'll call you tomorrow morning to tell you something important. Don't call me anymore Xavier. In fact, I'm gonna change

303
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:22,710
I'm changing like literally I'm changing my name. I'm changing everything about my life

304
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I don't like this guy. He's scary. Let's go to bed. Ooh

305
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:49,349
I thought I was in a bathtub for a second. Maybe they're sleeping with the sandals on. Yeah, that's weird

306
00:40:52,719 --> 00:41:00,239
Seems today is gonna be a good day. Luck is on your side young youtuber. What am I a fucking padawan? Okay

307
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:10,039
I need to I need to do a video about armored nucleus. Hmm. Hmm

308
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:17,289
Hey David, I just saw the videos you uploaded to your channel. They're good, but you might have noticed that they haven't gotten many visits

309
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:20,210
That's because they aren't good. I'm lying to you

310
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:25,500
I'm a manager agent person that just roped you into this isn't scamming you and it's gonna take

311
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:31,429
40% of all of your money check the daily trends to record and upload a video on them

312
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:43,880
You'll get more visits and subs check the trends on my phone. All right, here's my quests

313
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:54,500
Pay attention to what's currently trending in the city. They're split according to popularity into unknown normal well-known very there

314
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,030
It's their loot its loot colors

315
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:09,190
So this is okay this high profile. Oh my god now the deity of war game is pretty popular

316
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,929
But when you see any high profile or trending topic, you've got to go for it

317
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,219
This type of mentality to me is just like the ambulance chaser of like the lawyer world

318
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:21,619
No

319
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:24,480
I don't just make videos on what you want to make videos on

320
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:31,329
Like if I wake up in the morning and I see that like cats are trending on fucking YouTube

321
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,110
I'm not gonna rip out of the covers

322
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,150
Scramble to get out of bed and freak out to make a cat's video

323
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:42,300
They just do what you feel like doing make the videos make this stuff that you'd like to do

324
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,500
I don't I don't like this

325
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:51,780
I don't that's not don't listen to this popular trends in your content is the key to your videos getting lots of views and subscribers

326
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:57,789
This is why you aren't successful

327
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,940
This guy this guy over

328
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:06,989
Okay, well

329
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:09,300
Hmm

330
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:16,449
Six or seven million subscribers across all the platforms. I mean, it's like seven or eight million subscribers followers

331
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:25,590
I mean not was excuse me. It's definitely like not even a million by the way

332
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:29,380
It's I think it's like two million total

333
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:41,659
Arrogant have you seen that highest trending videos are about video games to record these kinds of videos

334
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:44,219
You need to install a gaming corner in your home. Why?

335
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:51,949
Remember you're a shadowy elite

336
00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:03,219
This person saying it read arrogant prick. Fuck you. We all hate you and watch you to make fun of you behind your back

337
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:19,219
Well, is it behind my back when you're all here doing it now? Oh, I'm aware. I need a gaming corner

338
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:27,070
Okay, add furniture add new workspace gaming corner

339
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:41,420
I wish I put this over here in the corner. I mean it says gaming corner

340
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:47,809
Oh, I feel like it'd have to be in a corner perfect

341
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:52,329
Now you've set up your gaming corner now all you need to do is game and a console and you be able to start recording gaming

342
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:53,329
videos

343
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:59,880
Alright many youtubers post gaming content try to find the most popular video games by the way

344
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,840
I've ordered you a game and a console so you can start go speak

345
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,920
Why did you buy me things go speak to Blair the girl in the player one video game store?

346
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,190
She'll give them to you. I think this actually is something

347
00:45:11,789 --> 00:45:15,269
Playing the popular games on Twitch and YouTube is almost a guaranteed way to

348
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:24,900
Not get very much attention like if I would have start playing a game that's in like the top 10 right now

349
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:31,030
There's potentially thousands and thousands and thousands of people doing that too. It doesn't matter how much it's trending

350
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:42,679
It's hard to stand out when you play the most popular video games because if I were to start streaming right now

351
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:45,239
Let's say I don't know what's like a really popular game right now

352
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,909
I don't like League of Legends or something, right?

353
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:55,159
If I were to start doing that now, there are probably thousands of other people all in the same boat doing the same thing

354
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:01,210
It's it's harder to stand out when you play like the popular trending topics

355
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:16,659
Even nobody's looking for youtubers life to content. Hey, you figured me out. You figured out the secret recipe play shit that nobody likes

356
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:30,539
Check the map app if you don't want to get lost beep beep. All right, it's all I got I have to go talk to this

357
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:37,139
Person play dragon rompo. I don't know what that is people keep asking me to do that

358
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:48,760
All right, so I gotta go get the console. Okay, and that is oh my vlog got three coins

359
00:46:48,760 --> 00:47:05,170
All right, the player one video game store. Where's that net flow these all aspiring youtubers? Can I talk restaurant?

360
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:20,809
Okay, do I have a map? All right, we need to go to player one. All right, so right there

361
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:27,539
There's my house was literally right across the goddamn Street. Okay. No, I'm kidding

362
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:29,139
I play the things I think are fun

363
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:32,699
You guys have seen me play popular games on this channel for like a decade

364
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:35,380
I'm listening to anything I say it's all horseshit

365
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:51,210
Player one. Did I play smite if you want to play it and you think it's fun?

366
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:57,110
All right, so I'm picking up my console that this weird guy that just flew me out here ordered for me

367
00:47:57,389 --> 00:48:04,110
Okay, League of Stars

368
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:20,079
What do I pick it up? Talk to Blair. Is this Blair? Where's Blair this deity of war? It's Dixie behind the counter

369
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,980
Okay. Hi, I don't help you with something. I'm here on behalf of Xavier

370
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,550
Okay, you're the new youtuber in town. Well Xavier called me to give you this

371
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:36,059
You are the console honey play studios one in the game deity of war

372
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:44,940
I would not hold this like this. They're all stored in your bag bag has limited space

373
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:53,559
This is just how people that go to the midnight release for games that do this

374
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:58,940
They run out if you're the first in line you run out with the thing you hold it up and everyone fucking cheers

375
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:11,750
Everyone's like yeah. Hey David. Do you have the game and console yet? Yes, right now. Let's record your first gameplay

376
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:34,039
Our new wow expansion. Oh, dude wrath of the Lich King. Are you serious Nax is out?

377
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:41,670
All right, let's go make a gameplay video. Wow. I played wow for like 30 years

378
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:46,449
I'm gonna make a reference to it every now and then I have talked about this before but listen to this

379
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:54,019
I have been there's more Wow in my head than I believe

380
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,340
Potentially time that I was in college

381
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:03,010
You understand like the amount of time that I was sitting in a classroom in college

382
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:09,170
Probably is the amount of time also that I was in world of warcraft. It was hundreds of days

383
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:13,670
So, of course, it's gonna be up there

384
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:21,190
Head is empty

385
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,300
No, it's just it's no, you know

386
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,389
My head the head is too full

387
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:29,110
I would like to go in to my head and sort of

388
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:34,550
Defrag it and just sort of delete a bunch of old info that I don't even care about anymore to make room for more

389
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:46,929
Oh shit record a gameplay you first need to place the game and console in the gaming corner and select the game and get recording

390
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:54,130
Make me want to quit video. Wait, what do you say? You make me want to quit video games

391
00:50:54,130 --> 00:51:00,949
So I don't end up like you what why?

392
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:11,429
What I'm not like screaming at you and what are you talking? I'm what does that mean? I'm kind of pretty normal

393
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:15,110
I'm just like hanging out. I said I what do you mean? I don't want to end up like you

394
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:32,949
I don't have any consoles. Oh, here we go console storage one. I put it on. Oh, here it is. Okay console and video game

395
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:34,230

It's time to record video with deity of war join prometheus on his mission to save humanity

397
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:47,760
tutorial first impressions speedrun

398
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:53,360
analysis

399
00:51:53,360 --> 00:52:02,400
Okay, I have to have gameplay reactions. You start recording and say hello

400
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:08,610
Yeah, whatever you have to play the game you unlock a new map you ship

401
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:21,110
I unlocked a new map. I don't understand you play for giggles

402
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:29,809
Like you your health is at one percent, but you skip you skip you

403
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:40,690
No, but you skip you ship your health is at one percent. So you ship you skip you skip you ship

404
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,250
What am I what am I doing?

405
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:48,130
You ship and it's over

406
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:59,199
Let's get some subs

407
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:05,400
Skip and ship ship is relationship. I don't but who

408
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:14,610
I said I unlocked a new map. What am I shipping the monopoly pieces?

409
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:23,480
Like I have a board or just a map. I don't get it. All right, let's go edit

410
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:27,349
I'm edit and for everyone to hate me because I do this wrong every time

411
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:29,750
I'm gonna do this wrong every single time. Just want to make sure people are aware of that

412
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:37,110
I'm gonna do this wrong every single fucking time. I'm not kidding. All right, let's go with uh,

413
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:57,840
Double double. No, not that one that one that one. Here we go. Here we go. All right, here we go thumbnail

414
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:02,710
Uh this one

415
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:09,860
Become an expert in deity of war in 10 minutes 20 never before seen adventure tricks the deity of war revolution

416
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:27,250
They hate this though. Is that a good enough title?

417
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:43,489
So I just skip every cutscene and just ship every character part four

418
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,650
Oh, they like it. They like it

419
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,440
All right. I published a gameplay. I did it

420
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,639
My energy is low

421
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:11,030
What do I get?

422
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:14,500
Plain hamburger

423
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:20,679
There are people buried in my in my backyard. Hey david. I thought you might be hungry after a long session recording and editing videos

424
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:31,489
Here's a plain hamburger. You won't be able to record or edit videos if your energy runs out for plenty of energy

425
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:33,250
You eat something or go to sleep?

426
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:41,780
Bunker w eating a plain hamburger is like that's serial killer vibes for me plain hamburger with nothing on it

427
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:55,039
Nothing just bun and meat. That's it. I mean if there was ketchup on it or anything. It's weird, right?

428
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,719
Does any of you guys eat just a plain just one hamburger patty and just bun?

429
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,369
I feel like everybody adds something

430
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:12,769
Whether it's like a squeeze it i'm serious even like a squeeze of mustard like a tablespoon of mustard makes that not weird to me

431
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:21,650
Monka s chat full of serial killers

432
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:31,750
All right, luckily saviour just sent you some food. I'm not gonna eat food somebody sent in a box

433
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:45,269
Tablespoon is a lot of mustard. I've seen a lot of people put way more mustard than that. What do I eat big afk?

434
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:53,010
An irresistible hamburger with okay, it's fine. Although I would remove the tomato

435
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,239
I would remove the tomato and I would probably remove the ketchup as well

436
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:07,650
I'm not gonna do look. I don't have to do the tomato sucks rant every like two months

437
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:13,940
We should have a clip for it because I mean every time I talk about how I don't like tomato people go

438
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:16,900
What are you talking about? So should I just do a clip so people would take like, uh

439
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:27,119
Like exclamation point point like tomato. Okay, here we go

440
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,559
Just real quick i'm gonna get this out of the way tomato on sandwiches or burgers or anything if you put a slice of no

441
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:40,599
Don't get me wrong. I love tomatoes. I love the vegetable tomato. I love tomato sauce. I love

442
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,960
Roasted tomatoes roasted cherry tomatoes. I look like tomato if it's a tomato dish

443
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:53,599
I love it to make a slice of tomato on a hamburger or a sandwich is

444
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:59,170
disgusting to me because the tomato is usually wet and slimy and

445
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:01,460
If you take a bite

446
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,739
It turns to like this weird sludgy water in your mouth

447
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:11,860
And sometimes you pull the whole tomato out while you pull back a tomato does not necessarily belong on a sandwich for me

448
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:19,329
It makes whatever you're eating wetter. Let me ask you a question. You know, you wash lettuce

449
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,239
Imagine you took just wet lettuce you rinsed lettuce. You didn't even let it dry

450
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:26,280
You just washed it

451
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,599
It was soaking wet and you put it right on the bun and you it's gonna be watery watery lettuce and soggy

452
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:41,300
You really want that you got to let it dry wait for it dry it cools it down

453
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,079
How hot are you?

454
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:46,039
How are you eating your hamburgers? What temperature are you eating your meat at?

455
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:56,369
It cools the burger down. Okay, so clip that I love tomatoes. I do

456
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:02,659
I just don't like tomatoes sliced on a sandwich. It kind of messes it up for me

457
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:10,079
I feel the same way about some onions, right? I love onions on it

458
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,909
I love onions on a tomato, but I don't want it on

459
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:18,849
Somebody's ringing. What is it now? Why don't you relax a bit and explore the city?

460
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:24,710
You're new in town and you need to meet people having good friends, which will definitely help your youtuber career

461
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:30,369
There are certain celebrities and odd neighbors in new tube city. Why don't you go meet them?

462
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:35,000
Okay, let me close that out onions are good on a burger

463
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:41,480
But they have to be done. I don't like it when it's just the big circle onion ring without the bread on it

464
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,880
You know what i'm talking about?

465
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,750
Why do people do that?

466
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,150
You get like you bite it and you get like fucking onion skin and like the whole chunk comes off it

467
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:56,659
No, no, I don't get that chopped onions. Yes sliced onions. Yes, but that big

468
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:11,159
Onion ring onion. No, you're a nine-year-old. No, i'm just I don't like weird texture on my hamburgers

469
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:18,309
Do your teeth not work? It's just no, I don't like it. It's it's what are you talking about?

470
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:23,570
Do you like tobaccos?

471
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:29,719
What just order tomato on the side? It doesn't sog up the sandwich burger when you order to go

472
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:33,719
Yeah, but eventually i'm gonna be putting it on i'm just gonna eat the tomato like a potato chip

473
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:42,920
Can I have a slice of tomato on the side like just to go yes

474
01:00:45,969 --> 01:00:49,909
That I don't really like tomatoes like that. Don't listen to them. You're right

475
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:57,190
I just don't like tomatoes like that because like the seed like the tomato like the insides. I don't know. It's just like

476
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:09,119
I don't like it. It's too mushy to be on a sandwich. What if they put tomato paste on a burger?

477
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:15,840
You're referring to ketchup, which I think is good. I like ketchup. I think that's fine

478
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:20,639
Dude, you know if they made like a hamburger

479
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,880
Uh

480
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:30,309
Tomato paste. All right. I'm gonna go out on a limb here if they made a burger that was

481
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,719
You know like a chicken palm sandwich

482
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:40,150
What if it was a burger palm and it was just a cheeseburger, but it had like marinara sauce and cheese on it

483
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:47,460
That might not be pretty good hamburger palm. There's your tomato paste hamburger

484
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:53,010
All right. I'm what am I supposed to be doing? You guys are distracting me

485
01:01:53,329 --> 01:02:02,420
Okay spicy ren the best spicy dishes in newtube city. All right, so this is the restaurant

486
01:02:02,659 --> 01:02:09,360
All right, we got trends here. Should I make another video? I was gonna make another video. Why not meet 10 neighbors?

487
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:19,269
All right. We're not i'm making another video. All right, we're gonna do a gameplay and can I talk about cats?

488
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,230
You start and I shyly say hello

489
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:33,090
Oh a mini boss appears and you make a technical comment. You explain the lore you skip the boss

490
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:41,590
Uh, oh all the gamers didn't like that. You sense a paranormal presence. You make a technical comment

491
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:51,170
You add you sign off and it's over should have talked about the lore

492
01:02:51,570 --> 01:03:02,309
Do these have a description? I don't really know what these all mean. All right, let's go publish it

493
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:14,179
I should do a vlog too. Shouldn't I? All right, let's start with this one. I'm gonna go

494
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,599
This one this one this one

495
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,710
Sure, why not?

496
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:31,639
I don't care about what the title is. No, it doesn't matter. I just do one of these get the latest the biggest gameplay pro

497
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:49,510
How about the biggest gameplay pro of adventure when I skipped the boss? That's gonna piss off subscribers though my gameplay on home

498
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,030
I think that's probably the default

499
01:03:53,860 --> 01:04:06,980
For if you save like a playstation 4 video on the ps4 action game play

500
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:15,510
Another game play the best game play gameplay. What about adventure another game play the best thing about deity of oar game play

501
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:22,920
Home game play gameplay. What about adventure? We're gonna talk about adventure game play. That's good

502
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:38,309
Do a two-minute fart prank video with eight-minute vlog about family stuff

503
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:45,090
What

504
01:04:45,090 --> 01:05:01,969
A two-minute fart prank. I gotta go meet people but i'm tired. Hold on. Why would you read that?

505
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:09,650
My house is wait a minute. My home's value is increasing because

506
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:25,300
My subscribers are increasing. That's weird. That's how it works

507
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:47,039
You leave a bowl of candy out for trick-or-treaters you asshole. Excuse me. That's trespassing. No

508
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:49,809
Good morning, david

509
01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:53,730
Did you know that the event all the youtubers are waiting for is coming to the city in the last week of spring?

510
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:05,889
Uh, I don't know what that is

511
01:06:05,889 --> 01:06:09,329
It's the playcon gaming festival and it's celebrated once a year in newtube city

512
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:16,280
This festival will be full of influential people from the area conferences events

513
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:22,340
You can't miss the playcon if you want to make yourself known you're gonna get egged

514
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:28,739
You imagine I had like a note

515
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,420
Imagine you lived in a in a place and you put a note on your door

516
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:39,599
No halloween decorations nothing and it just said like the act of trick-or-treating is trespassing

517
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,960
I do not support this this this archaic old stupid lifestyle or something, right?

518
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:51,219
You have like a huge note on the door

519
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:54,900
That's the kind of person that I would assume would be the person that's complaining

520
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,920
If you had like an hoa or something about like your garbage cans being too far away from the curb

521
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:09,829
That's who that person I think is right

522
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:16,309
By the way use the fact that everyone is talking about the playcon festival to your advantage and post playcon content

523
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,650
Teepied or egged would you just wake up to like a completely mummified house?

524
01:07:29,989 --> 01:07:45,920
I feel like that's you'd walk out the door turn around and your house would be just a completely mummified and then it rains

525
01:07:46,159 --> 01:08:00,039
Oh god, what if it rained your house would just be taped paper mache

526
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,650
All right, let's go to the the convention. There's a huge promotional poster in the city

527
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:11,190
You know how you can post content almost instantly for your followers

528
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:21,520
How with the insta life app i'll listen to me guys listen to me listen to me

529
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,789
Whatever you're doing right now

530
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:30,770
Stop what you're doing turn the volume up a little bit and sit here for a moment and listen to me

531
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:37,890
You don't got to do all that shit. You don't have to you don't it doesn't it's okay

532
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:43,319
You don't have to do all this you don't have to have like 30 instagram posts a week

533
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:57,569
You don't have to be on twitter every day. You don't have to do this. You don't have to listen up the fucking video game

534
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,319
Listen to me everybody everybody

535
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:06,390
Let's get serious do it because I want to

536
01:09:06,869 --> 01:09:12,079
Yeah, I hope that's true. I feel like there's a shitload. Let's get real you ready

537
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:19,619
I feel like there's a shitload of pressure right now on a lot of people that are in the younger age brackets to constantly

538
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:27,840
Need to sort of make everybody aware of what they're doing. Just do it in moderation

539
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:35,010
Trust me. It feels like a lot of the younger crowd is in a constant competition with each other

540
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:49,029
You know what i'm saying? You're getting political. That's not political. That's just life

541
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:54,439
I'm so glad i'm not growing up with the social media stuff from today

542
01:09:54,439 --> 01:10:00,880
I can't imagine how damaging that mindset is to little kids. Yeah, just be careful. Don't get too

543
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:06,399
Into it don't get too don't let it consume you because it can and I especially when you're really young too

544
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:09,119
Some of like the 10 11 12 13 year olds

545
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,850
I don't know. I just I feel like I i'd be like in this constant mindset of constant

546
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,279
You got a lot of shit to worry about too when you're like a teenager, right?

547
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:34,050
It's like another thing to have to be in a constant competition about it's limited. This stream is 18 plus. They're not here

548
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:45,489
Move on it's a social network app for you to share your photos with your followers instantly

549
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:48,130
This would also help you make yourself a known a known person in the city

You can also follow people you know see what they're posting and they can even send you private messages

551
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:04,369
They've done surveys that said that yeah, it's a lot to have to pay attention to like guys

552
01:11:04,449 --> 01:11:07,960

There are trends that when you discover them remain captured and you can talk about them in another kind of script

603
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:07,279
See which script you can use it in and take the opportunity to record a video of it because only it only lasts one day

That is one to two seconds of your whole video and it might be a 12 minute video

825
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:06,720
That's the tactic

826
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:10,229
That's how you do it. Like for instance

827
01:54:20,579 --> 01:54:29,880
That would be the title for the vod of the far cry six stream. Technically. That's not a lie

828
01:54:31,109 --> 01:54:42,000
Happened at some point. It's there somewhere just make it that are there any alligators even in this game?

932
02:10:37,810 --> 02:10:45,170
Mantendo z rumor they're saying that in the mantendo conference on the 25th during the playcon festival

They're going to present a new console that will revolutionize the video game sector

934
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:53,729
It's also rumored that a few chosen people will be able to get the console during the conference

935
02:10:54,210 --> 02:10:57,380
Can you imagine being one of the first to upload videos on the new console?

936

You have to go to that conference no matter what I can't I can't I don't have money

You can move up the youtuber ranking by getting followers

939
02:11:12,079 --> 02:11:15,119
So now you know you need to get these followers before the 25th day

02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:22,789
By the way, look around the city for any posters advertising the mantendo conference and upload an insta life photo

969
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:43,280

970
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:53,489
200 views video maybe like 400 or 500 views video. I went to sleep. I made the uber update video and I woke up and

02:20:35,170 --> 02:20:38,610

1065
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:07,649
Ramon

The guard we never miss a single episode of toby spark series. Enjoy the city

We don't miss a single episode of toby spark series

1068
02:32:15,430 --> 02:32:20,209
I feel like that's like a you're giving me code word for like drugs are in the back

1069
02:32:20,930 --> 02:32:23,360
I don't what does that mean?

Let's take a picture of it

1073
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:47,600
How am I supposed to get that in a video or in a selfie?

1074
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:56,840
like oh take a take a picture with the hashtag watch cats, but

1075
02:32:57,799 --> 02:32:59,000

1076
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:05,430
All right. I'm in downtown. We're gonna find the youtuber

1077
02:33:09,149 --> 02:33:27,079
Eectopia, let's just just go in the gym. No, okay. I'm just gonna go to bed

1080
02:33:47,600 --> 02:34:04,069
Watch cats, why can't I I don't get it. How do I get a picture of that? It's probably a poster somewhere

1081
02:34:04,389 --> 02:34:14,159
What's the topic right now that's trending?

1082
02:34:14,159 --> 02:34:20,260
Oh, no, no, no, no

1083
02:34:20,260 --> 02:34:25,620
Watch cats as people still think it's cool read the channel

1084
02:34:29,319 --> 02:34:33,319
Uh, and let's skip

1085
02:34:33,319 --> 02:34:34,680
You died

1086
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:40,149
Maybe I would be giggling

1087
02:34:40,149 --> 02:34:42,149
Uh sign off and say it's over

1088
02:34:42,229 --> 02:34:49,860
All right

1089
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:55,729
Now take a picture of the screen and send it to that lady that I hear about haunted chocolatier

1090
02:34:56,290 --> 02:35:04,229
I can't wait to play that in the indefinite future whenever that comes out. Who knows when very excited for it though

1091
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:27,440
Very excited. Oh fuck. Okay. No, I can do it action secrets revealed. Uh, the biggest gameplay pro

1092
02:35:28,079 --> 02:35:36,180
It's the latest. No, they're gonna hate that. Um, what should I do?

1093
02:35:36,819 --> 02:35:42,770
Let's see. What's a good grabbing title?

1094
02:36:10,069 --> 02:36:14,420
liar

1095
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:20,180
Plug on the plug. That's you freaked out. You had to tell everybody that gets the point across

1096
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:38,290
There's no time to care about the title couldn't even break 1k. Come on. I'm almost in the top 75

1097
02:36:44,280 --> 02:36:49,670
Please buy a shirt. I'm not gonna buy anything until I can go to the convention push-ups

1098
02:36:50,229 --> 02:36:57,540
Ooh, it's 500 bucks to go to the convention. I need to go. I like everything related to david

1099
02:36:57,540 --> 02:37:00,129
So I liked your last photo. Thank you

1100
02:37:01,809 --> 02:37:13,879
All right push-ups we're gonna go do push-ups in the gym. It's not creepy or anything. No

1101
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,850
Is the ultimate poser exercise?

1102
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:23,840
How push-ups they've been doing push-ups

1103
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:37,270
Since since rome. What do you mean poser? I want to do push-ups

1104
02:37:43,190 --> 02:37:45,190
Punch act like a poser. What?

1105
02:37:46,760 --> 02:37:50,149
No, I want to push up

1106
02:37:50,149 --> 02:37:52,149
Weight training. I want to do push-ups

1107
02:37:55,459 --> 02:38:02,690
Stretch like a poser. Where's the push-ups thing stretch like a poser

1108
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:07,280
I want to do push-ups

1109
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:17,299
Then you get a rush at a playing sports. You can increase your energy by training and you'll stay in shape

1110
02:38:25,909 --> 02:38:56,149
Act like a poser. What's the difference? Okay dumbbells sports. Um right there

1111
02:39:33,110 --> 02:40:03,079
Whoa, is this the subscriber special? I want to do push-ups. You liked that. All right, how do you do push-ups? Nice

1112
02:40:03,159 --> 02:40:32,120
Okay. All right, you like it. I just got a bunch of subs for this

1113
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:41,040
You know, I often get letters from admirers but today a super intense letter from someone called

1114
02:40:42,850 --> 02:40:50,280
To bercio arrived asking me to return to boxing. What's strange is that it has the elite fitness club scene on it

1115
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:56,600
I think to bercio is the real name of that stuck-up guy who works here boosts or roots or something like that

1116
02:40:57,319 --> 02:41:03,270
All right. Well, I want to do push-ups. So what am I gonna how do I do that?

1117
02:41:03,670 --> 02:41:23,969
Where do you do push-ups on the ground on the floor? Yeah, but I couldn't do them

1118
02:41:24,450 --> 02:41:37,250
Can I do anything out here? All right. Well, I obviously can't so what what's the goal here?

1119
02:41:44,319 --> 02:41:45,760
Just do a stretch

1120
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:56,260
I saw on insta-life that the fire serpent boxer might be coming back to fight that chick rocks

1121
02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:06,469
Fire serpent take a picture and then do a push-up. There's no push-up pose

1122
02:42:07,110 --> 02:42:20,360
Okay, who's this?

1123
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:22,040
gg

1124
02:42:22,040 --> 02:42:24,920
I'm gg macaroon. Haven't you heard of me?

1125
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:29,360
um

1126
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:31,360
Not even your own grandmother knows who you are

1127
02:42:32,159 --> 02:42:36,370
Yes, uh, uh, yeah, I don't know whatever go away now shoe

1128
02:42:38,309 --> 02:43:07,329
The e-sports bar what can I do in here? Let's just start push-ups drink a coffee. I couldn't even get it refreshing

1129
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:51,670
What do you got a burrito mom, which I can't buy any of this stuff. I need to save money

1130
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:20,899
What is an e-sports bar? I don't know. All right. I need I need to whiz i'm looking for pewdiepie, right?

1131
02:44:21,139 --> 02:44:28,739
Isn't that what I'm supposed to be looking for pewdiepie. It's like find him downtown. Is this technically downtown?

1132
02:44:29,059 --> 02:44:48,309
It's a different city the pewdiepie there he is. Oh my god, it's pewdiepie and his little dog

1133
02:44:48,790 --> 02:44:56,959
Maya, is there something better to endorse your work? Is this voice acted? Oh, that would be funny

1134
02:44:56,959 --> 02:45:02,000
But what endorse a very suspicious guy was offering access to cyberware this morning

1135
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,750
People are going nuts about this and it looks really bad. Has he offered it to you?

1136
02:45:11,829 --> 02:45:13,909
Yes, but I need the support of a super youtuber

1137
02:45:14,549 --> 02:45:20,340
Yes, but I need the endorsement to access it this one. I have an idea

1138
02:45:21,459 --> 02:45:26,020
Take a signed photo of me so he sees we know each other and gives you access to the game

1139
02:45:27,649 --> 02:45:32,370
Your drone will let me know when you have it. Let's go to your house. We'll record a video together

1140
02:45:36,229 --> 02:45:38,149
This is kind of just like

1141
02:45:38,149 --> 02:45:43,909
The dream I think of a lot of young people. I think that may have watched pewdiepie in the past maybe

1142
02:45:44,629 --> 02:45:45,670
where

1143
02:45:45,670 --> 02:45:51,329
Hey, let's make video at your house and your your camera and you play your game. This is kind of um

1144
02:45:53,299 --> 02:45:55,799
This is uh, well

1145
02:45:55,879 --> 02:45:58,040
This is a dream come true for a lot of people

1146
02:46:01,559 --> 02:46:02,520
Okay

1147
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:06,840
Uh, Maya will take me to where you live. She's got an incredible sense of smell. What do you think your dog can?

1148
02:46:07,799 --> 02:46:12,600
Find my address by smelling

1149
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:16,370
Imagine turning this down

1150
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:19,170
No, no, no, no, no. Thanks. Not perhaps another time

1151
02:46:20,950 --> 02:46:24,069
Yes, come to open my place record the video great idea. We'll record at my house

1152
02:46:31,219 --> 02:46:35,540
I guess this is I guess we're doing this go and get the game. I'll be waiting for you at your house

1153
02:46:36,100 --> 02:46:39,350
It's not

1154
02:46:39,350 --> 02:46:41,350
This is all right. This is a weird picture

1155
02:46:41,510 --> 02:46:44,340
This is the picture that sits on like a gasket

1156
02:46:45,959 --> 02:46:48,840
What is this weird just framed photo with the thing in the back?

1157
02:46:49,559 --> 02:46:56,000
This is weird. I thought I was gonna get like a like a poster

1158
02:46:56,639 --> 02:47:02,280
I have to bring it to that guy

1159
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:08,049
I don't even know where that guy was

1160
02:47:08,049 --> 02:47:23,319
He was in the other city, wasn't he? He's down at the port, right?

1161
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:31,030
You have to take a picture with this. Oh my god

1162
02:47:32,129 --> 02:47:34,129
Oh, no, i'm just gonna stay up all night

1163
02:47:34,209 --> 02:47:39,719
Because I definitely have to take a picture with this. It looks like the portrait of a communist leader

1164
02:47:40,520 --> 02:48:00,200
I wonder how many youtubers are in this game or is it just pewdiepie?

1165
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:05,829
You think they have is there a bunch of people in this game? I'm actually very curious. I'm very intrigued

1166
02:48:06,229 --> 02:48:19,329
Okay, look I have this take a look

1167
02:48:20,579 --> 02:48:21,540
See

1168
02:48:21,540 --> 02:48:26,040
Wow, what do you got there photo of pewdiepie himself? This really is an endorsement

1169
02:48:28,129 --> 02:48:30,129
It's is it really though

1170
02:48:30,389 --> 02:48:33,610
I mean you really deserve to try the game. Here's your cyberware

1171
02:48:37,399 --> 02:48:41,000
Searching for a famous youtuber completed. All right, cool. Did I get it?

1172
02:48:41,799 --> 02:48:44,420
I got it cyberware

1173
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:57,250
Why is cyberware just watch cats? Is it the same game with a different? I don't get it. This is worth five thousand dollars

1174
02:49:00,979 --> 02:49:04,180
Run pewdiepie. Oh, I thought it was like pewdiepie is coming after me

1175
02:49:05,409 --> 02:49:07,409
Run pewdiepie is behind you

1176
02:49:13,299 --> 02:49:23,569
I this is good. I can't wait. This is gonna be so fun, but it's 10 o'clock. I don't have I don't think I can do it

1177
02:49:28,100 --> 02:49:42,260
Do not call pewdiepie at 5 a.m. Should that be the video we make but it's just he's actually just there

1178
02:49:46,709 --> 02:49:56,280
All right, I gotta go home quick. Is he just is he actually just gonna be in the house?

1179
02:50:00,020 --> 02:50:03,860
Oh my god, you got the game. I'm wondering what we'll find when we play let's record that video

1180
02:50:05,719 --> 02:50:06,520
All right

1181
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:13,270
I feel like I would want to clean my whole house four times before he came over. You know what I mean? Like

1182
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:23,489
Okay, record video

1183
02:50:23,489 --> 02:50:37,700
Watch cats. No, I don't have it. Oh, yeah, I do it is the same game. Okay cyberware

1184
02:50:40,579 --> 02:50:48,370
Is he gonna be in the video? I switched the camera to make sure that pewdiepie is in the frame running out of energy

1185
02:50:48,690 --> 02:51:10,450
All right, come on gameplay you start and is pewdiepie's watching me make this video you greet the channel

1186
02:51:10,850 --> 02:51:16,500
There's a lot of pressure here while the game loads you

1187
02:51:17,219 --> 02:51:24,180
You make a technical comment. Oh, there's a graphics glitch gotta laugh it up

1188
02:51:27,879 --> 02:51:29,399
to finish

1189
02:51:29,399 --> 02:51:33,399
You sign off. That's a five-star video and I did that in front of pewdiepie

1190
02:51:39,010 --> 02:51:44,450
All right. Now here's where the funny part of us would come in pewdiepie says thanks a lot

1191
02:51:44,530 --> 02:51:46,180
I'll invoice you

1192
02:51:46,180 --> 02:51:50,840
And there's an invoice in the mailbox in like a month or two. That's like five grand

1193
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:58,879
Does pewdiepie help me edit it? This game is so boring. Is this the hit game?

1194
02:51:58,879 --> 02:52:06,930
Everyone's talking about it's so short and there's nothing to do. Oh, wait, you got a strange message on insta life

1195
02:52:07,489 --> 02:52:15,600
This is very shady. Pewdiepie is a whiz with videos. He'll know what we should do. Pewdiepie. What do we do?

1196
02:52:16,319 --> 02:52:21,350
Pewdiepie is a top video maker. He will know what to do. What do we do?

1197
02:52:23,170 --> 02:52:24,370
If you recorded the video yet

1198
02:52:24,370 --> 02:52:29,409
I haven't told you the most interesting bit about all this if you send a stream of messages to all your contacts

1199
02:52:29,649 --> 02:52:40,639
Praising this amazing game will give you a hundred coins. I don't have any contacts. So this is perfect. Yes, i'll do it

1200
02:52:40,879 --> 02:52:52,920
I don't have one person in my phone. Sure. Let's go. Thank i'll do it immediately. Your face looks full of questions

1201
02:52:53,319 --> 02:53:00,280
Shoot, how may I help the salesman asked us to spam? They'll give us a hundred coins if we spam our fans

1202
02:53:01,750 --> 02:53:05,670
I knew it. They want to promote a crappy product by using youtubers who take cheap bribes

1203
02:53:05,989 --> 02:53:11,030
You have to enter the message thread so that with your talent as a youtuber you can report the scam

1204
02:53:12,260 --> 02:53:15,459
First we have to catch this sales guy wherever he is. Do you know where to look?

1205
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:26,069
It's probably in the port neighborhood almost but not quite. Maya has tracked down the salesman and he is downtown

1206
02:53:26,389 --> 02:53:32,600
Okay, we'll catch the scammer. You'll see I have to go and look for Maya first, but i'll see you there

1207
02:53:32,920 --> 02:53:46,229
Oh, I do. Wait, I added all these people in my phone

1208
02:53:46,629 --> 02:54:05,639
I don't remember getting all these people's numbers. All right. I want to see if there's any youtubers here. Come on

1209
02:54:05,959 --> 02:54:20,079
There are definitely other youtubers hidden in here. We have to find them. Okay, uh, it seems

1210
02:54:21,780 --> 02:54:30,120
Like Maya found the salesman in an alleyway with stairs. I have to go to sleep man. It's two o'clock in the morning

1211
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:45,719
Did I not upload the video with pewdiepie? I didn't upload it

1212

03:44:32,000 --> 03:44:33,959
Are you a developer?

1516
03:44:33,959 --> 03:44:38,760
Hi, i'm stewart lee the designer of spider bro. I'm presenting it two days before it goes on sale

1517
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:42,559
If you want to try it out, you'll have to live stream it on the console

1518
03:44:42,639 --> 03:44:44,639
Do you know how to live stream? Of course I do

1519
03:44:45,829 --> 03:44:50,549
Well, I don't think your drone has the streaming function. So why don't you go over to the console and give it a try?

1520
03:44:51,190 --> 03:44:54,000
And i'll explain how you can install this function

1521
03:44:55,090 --> 03:44:56,629
streaming

1522
03:44:56,629 --> 03:44:59,909
Go over to the console and try it out and then i'll explain how you can install this function on your drone

1523
03:45:00,549 --> 03:45:06,260
Okay developer day spider bro

1524
03:45:06,739 --> 03:45:20,760
A lot of trending shit here. All right, this is the rhythm game. I'm live that person has 3.9 million concurrent viewers

1525
03:45:22,840 --> 03:45:24,840
How is that? How many people is that actually?

1526
03:45:29,989 --> 03:45:54,200
That's insane

1527
03:45:54,200 --> 03:46:01,780
What the fuck is going on? Oh, okay. I'm good. Is this what it's like to stream?

1528
03:46:03,540 --> 03:46:06,100
um

1529
03:46:06,100 --> 03:46:08,100
Sometimes it can feel like that

1530
03:46:08,420 --> 03:46:15,250
I should just stream again

1531
03:46:15,250 --> 03:46:19,729
Yeah, that was 150. It's way better than new tube. Let's go

1532
03:46:37,379 --> 03:46:41,059
And I get access to the game early i'm gonna do this as many times as I can before I pass out

1533
03:46:59,040 --> 03:47:07,879
All right. Good. Hell. Yeah, 150 dollars save that one too. I'm gonna upload like five of these videos. They're super funny

1534
03:47:10,879 --> 03:47:22,500
Eat a bunch of takeout do it again. No space available

1535
03:47:25,059 --> 03:47:33,379
Okay, whatever. Can I get a selfie with you developer day?

1536
03:47:57,829 --> 03:48:22,819
All right, I got that now I gotta turn the videos in oh i'm running out of time seven hours what are your thoughts on um,

1537
03:48:23,860 --> 03:48:30,100
Even more. I don't know what that is. I refuse to even say it out loud talk to the dev I did. Oh shit

1538
03:48:30,500 --> 03:48:41,000
I just played the game and left that's rude. You're right, but they're closed now

1539
03:48:42,559 --> 03:48:47,360
They closed three hours ago and I was still in there exclusive. Come on. I'm a tuber. I get exclusive, uh access

1540
03:48:47,680 --> 03:49:09,090
I got three videos to make i'm gonna be pulling it all nighter on this one. All right edit video

1541
03:49:10,870 --> 03:49:25,649
I have the streams the vlog in front of the fountain. Let's get that one done now. Are you kidding me?

1542
03:49:31,590 --> 03:49:42,450
Are you serious? I don't care. This is like a sponsored video. Do I like this? This guy paid me to make this

1543
03:49:42,450 --> 03:50:14,979
I don't care. All right, they liked it. I'll take my I got 1200 bucks now. I could probably buy something

1544
03:50:16,850 --> 03:50:28,659
All right, let's go again. I still have a takeout pulling an all-nighter here. Come on. Let's go. This was a better

1545
03:50:28,659 --> 03:50:41,239
This was the best stream. This was the developer day. This is trending. This is huge. Um, none of these fit together

1546
03:50:59,159 --> 03:51:05,600
When is second david gonna come up? Whatever it's trending

1547
03:51:05,840 --> 03:51:48,120
Yeah, I gotta get my hands in there the biggest game stream pro of adventure. Come on more good

1548
03:51:48,440 --> 03:51:59,010
When is david craft someday soon? All right, I have two of those I put it together. Do I have enough energy?

1549
03:52:01,360 --> 03:52:10,290
Damn it. All right, let's go to bed wake up 1k 2k

1550
03:52:11,430 --> 03:52:19,719
2k 3k come on buy some better editing. That's not a bad idea. We'll try that now

1551
03:52:19,879 --> 03:52:31,670
Did one of those get copyright claimed you have to buy live streaming function in ertech

1552
03:52:31,909 --> 03:52:45,250
Okay, something you would have already solved if you'd gone streaming with steward lee yesterday, but who am I to judge didn't I what?

1553
03:52:45,729 --> 03:52:50,129
I did i'm editing the videos from those streams. What are you talking about?

1554
03:52:50,709 --> 03:53:08,479
Yeah, what install editor increase the score for the clip complete all output connections complete all input

1555
03:53:08,559 --> 03:53:19,989
Connections increase the editor that was a thou that was a thousand bucks. It's gone. Is it gone?

1556
03:53:20,629 --> 03:53:39,219
What's happening right now?

1557
03:53:39,219 --> 03:53:43,219
Okay, this is really confusing. All right, so put you can put it on each individual clip

1558
03:53:43,299 --> 03:53:53,510
You only have a certain amount of render points. I get it so I can do it to one we'll do to this one

1559
03:53:57,569 --> 03:53:58,370
Okay

1560
03:53:58,370 --> 03:54:11,239
Publish developer day secrets revealed fun. Honey play studios one the end will make you roll on the floor laughing. Sure

1561
03:54:21,799 --> 03:54:28,840
Now I will go buy a shirt, but I already okay. I guess we didn't do this

1562
03:54:29,319 --> 03:54:33,989
You're so epic and you're my best friend

1563
03:54:35,799 --> 03:54:36,680
um

1564
03:54:36,680 --> 03:54:51,840
I don't really know who you are, but thanks for watching. That was a bot. It was not a bot

1565
03:54:58,549 --> 03:55:00,549
That was not a bot talking

1566
03:55:04,739 --> 03:55:08,659
I told you we're we're all just a collective group of people hanging out having fun

1567
03:55:09,219 --> 03:55:17,139
Did you get it? That's how it works. I can't live stream here because the person's not here anymore

1568
03:55:17,139 --> 03:55:26,000
So how am I supposed to do this?

1569
03:55:26,000 --> 03:55:28,000
Find the er

1570
03:55:37,680 --> 03:55:38,799
Er

1571
03:55:38,799 --> 03:55:50,180
What this is not that much views I got like 3k yesterday. What's going on here? Where's that er tech place other side of town?

1572
03:55:52,129 --> 03:55:56,129
Yeah, all right. Let's go get some clothes at least a t-shirt

1573
03:56:15,559 --> 03:56:17,559
magic pixels t-shirt

1574
03:56:19,940 --> 03:56:36,530
Emoji shirt salamander sweatshirt. How about the emoji shirt? Yeah, put it on everybody put it on

1575
03:56:36,930 --> 03:56:43,940
What does this immortal snail I keep saying? Oh the immortal snail the immortal snail dude. I don't know

1576
03:56:45,170 --> 03:56:56,690
What's the immortal snail? It's a tick tock thing. Okay

1577
03:56:57,250 --> 03:57:22,260
Spider bro still a thing. How is that not a thing? All right, I need to go this way

1578
03:57:27,620 --> 03:57:31,459
Uh, you and a snail both get immortality and a million dollars

1579
03:57:31,860 --> 03:57:39,430
But the snail is always coming wait, but the snail is always coming towards you and if it touches you you die

1580
03:57:42,920 --> 03:57:44,680
I can't

1581
03:57:44,680 --> 03:57:49,350
I can't crush. I can't like just kill the snail. The snail is immortal

1582
03:57:49,590 --> 03:57:58,479
If I touch it with anything it kills me

1583
03:57:58,479 --> 03:58:05,760
Well what you would have to just kind of just hire a bunch of scientists to come up with how long it would actually take

1584
03:58:05,760 --> 03:58:08,000
the snail to

1585
03:58:08,559 --> 03:58:11,520
Go from one coast of the united states to the other coast

1586
03:58:13,430 --> 03:58:15,430
And I mean that that's a very simple question

1587
03:58:16,420 --> 03:58:19,219
to answer because what you would do

1588
03:58:19,299 --> 03:58:26,129
Is if you had a million dollars, right? I get a million bucks. I would just buy or rent two properties at the same time

1589
03:58:26,770 --> 03:58:27,959
one

1590
03:58:27,959 --> 03:58:33,639
in california and one in like florida or massachusetts or like maine or something, right?

1591
03:58:34,280 --> 03:58:37,000
And we would determine how long it took the snail to go back and forth

1592
03:58:37,559 --> 03:58:40,530
and let's say it was like

1593
03:58:40,610 --> 03:58:42,229
20 years

1594
03:58:42,229 --> 03:58:45,829
It's going to be like 10 to 20 years of the snail maybe more for the snail to do that

1595
03:58:46,549 --> 03:58:49,110
So you would just go live in your in your california house

1596
03:58:49,750 --> 03:58:51,190
For 10 years

1597
03:58:51,190 --> 03:58:55,510
And then once it became like eight and a half years just to make sure you got it right or make about nine years

1598
03:58:55,909 --> 03:59:00,840
You just go live in the other house for like two three years like 20 years. You would just keep going back and forth

1599
03:59:08,000 --> 03:59:09,120
That's easy

1600
03:59:09,120 --> 03:59:15,670
It would probably take a snail 30 plus years to go that far whenever you sleep

1601
03:59:15,670 --> 03:59:20,559
You don't dream you just see whatever the snail sees at that time. Well, that would be awful

1602
03:59:25,010 --> 03:59:29,409
One million is not enough for that

1603
03:59:29,409 --> 03:59:33,170
I wouldn't buy a house in california. Then I don't know somewhere cheaper

1604
03:59:33,569 --> 03:59:40,319
Just put it in a box. Well, it could get out of the box if I if you go across the whole country

1605
03:59:40,639 --> 03:59:42,799
There's no way a snail can find you that fast

1606
03:59:43,440 --> 03:59:50,129
What have you got on a plane?

1607
03:59:50,129 --> 03:59:55,489
Does the snail have intelligence or is this just a snail just walks in a straight line across the continent of the united states?

1608
03:59:58,610 --> 04:00:05,090
Does the snail have intelligence? It knows it knows to like get on a plane and go on somebody's luggage and get on the plane from

1609
04:00:06,049 --> 04:00:16,639
Boston to la does it have that intelligence it is. Yes. Okay, it's hyper intelligent. Um

1610
04:00:17,280 --> 04:00:24,229
Okay

1611
04:00:24,229 --> 04:00:26,229
And in that case, I would just probably

1612
04:00:26,739 --> 04:00:31,059
I don't know hire you can have a million dollars. So I would hire somebody to be at every entrance in my house

1613
04:00:32,899 --> 04:00:34,950
Or wherever it was

1614
04:00:34,950 --> 04:00:38,930
And just to stay there and if they see a snail it doesn't kill them, right?

1615
04:00:39,090 --> 04:00:42,100
So they would just pick it up and get on a plane

1616
04:00:42,180 --> 04:00:52,520
Why don't they just pick it up and put it like keep it as a pet or something pause the game?

1617
04:00:52,520 --> 04:00:55,489
Oh shit, whatever

1618
04:00:55,489 --> 04:00:58,530
Can you keep okay? What if you like get a box? That's a glass

1619
04:00:59,170 --> 04:01:00,559
box

1620
04:01:00,559 --> 04:01:02,559
and you put lettuce and

1621
04:01:02,639 --> 04:01:07,680
A little uh enclosure and it's nice and comfortable big enough where it's comfortable and you'll just keep the snail in there

1622
04:01:10,680 --> 04:01:19,379
That's why would that be hard?

1623
04:01:19,379 --> 04:01:23,809
Nine to nine shit. All right. Well now I can't do anything

1624
04:01:24,370 --> 04:01:33,350
Because I still said it's doing nothing put down a salt circle

1625
04:01:35,590 --> 04:01:54,370
Well that that no because it's it's an immortal snail. That's not gonna work cover the snail in concrete

1626
04:01:57,620 --> 04:02:02,340
Yeah, but you know, I don't know. I feel like you'd have to put it in concrete put it in the ground

1627
04:02:02,819 --> 04:02:07,350
All right. I'm just walking back and forth. I'm not doing anything. I need to go back to the house

1628
04:02:07,989 --> 04:02:19,989
Yeah, is it immortal or invincible? That's a good question. Where's my fucking house?

1629
04:02:30,950 --> 04:02:32,709
I don't think that would be hard to do

1630
04:02:32,709 --> 04:02:36,920
Especially considering that I would just set up motion detectors

1631
04:02:38,420 --> 04:02:41,729
In the house, right?

1632
04:02:41,729 --> 04:02:44,610
So it would sense any movement at all in any of the rooms

1633
04:02:44,690 --> 04:02:47,250
So I would be awoken by like an alarm sound

1634
04:02:48,200 --> 04:03:04,959
And if I see the snail just slowly coming towards me i'm i'm gonna the area is it's too slow to get noticed

1635
04:03:13,000 --> 04:03:23,399
Just do the tick tock video already. What does that mean? Does that mean?

1636
04:03:24,370 --> 04:03:32,000
Have the lady talk for the first five seconds. How would you deal with a snail coming at you?

1637
04:03:34,129 --> 04:03:35,889
Seems to be a huge threat in newtube city

1638
04:03:35,889 --> 04:03:46,840
Go to the fisherman to find out more if you don't remember where it is looking up on the map. This life is on fire

1639
04:03:49,600 --> 04:03:51,360
Don't check your messages

1640
04:03:51,360 --> 04:03:59,969
Beware i'm near the fisherman and the tide has risen so high the pier is in danger

1641
04:04:01,920 --> 04:04:07,600
Hey bad day for surfing the sea is roaring. I'm is it we are we in a scenario where we're getting what's happening right now?

1642
04:04:13,430 --> 04:04:20,069
What is craner? Are we about to get like attacked?

1643
04:04:20,549 --> 04:04:26,469
What is it? What is it talking about? Are we gonna be like attacked by water? What does it mean like a storm?

1644
04:04:31,479 --> 04:04:33,479
This hits the snail

1645
04:04:33,479 --> 04:04:35,879
What about craner? It's the most popular. What is craner?

1646
04:04:38,340 --> 04:04:42,440
All right. I need to go down

1647
04:04:42,440 --> 04:04:44,629
First thing is first

1648
04:04:44,629 --> 04:04:48,229
What was I doing? When is this open from the seventh to the split? This is not open

1649
04:04:51,319 --> 04:04:53,159
It's about to be closed

1650
04:04:53,159 --> 04:05:00,959
All right, we're gonna go to the beach which is a subway

1651
04:05:13,860 --> 04:05:16,739
Okay. Oh my god. It really is

1652
04:05:17,379 --> 04:05:21,030
Beware i'm near the fisherman and the tide has risen

1653
04:05:23,549 --> 04:05:26,020
Fisherman

1654
04:05:26,020 --> 04:05:53,120
All right, the fisherman what the hell is going on down here tide is coming in. It doesn't look like it. I don't get it

1655
04:06:04,309 --> 04:06:06,309
You're doing a hurricane vlog

1656
04:06:06,629 --> 04:06:21,200
Sunbathe because i'm bathing in a hurricane. He's getting so many likes

1657
04:06:23,040 --> 04:06:44,979
Um, what am I supposed to do down i'm by the fisherman so over here, okay

1658
04:06:45,760 --> 04:06:53,620
That blonde boy might be able to tell you what is happening. He's got a weird. What was what his weird voice

1659
04:06:54,420 --> 04:06:57,139
Where am I? What am I doing here? I feel like I have some kind of troll inside my head

1660
04:06:57,139 --> 04:06:59,299
I can't even remember my name. I used to create videos, you know

1661
04:07:01,760 --> 04:07:07,909
Craner that's all I know and uh, and that I was you a you you a youtuber

1662
04:07:08,549 --> 04:07:12,229
You're a youtuber good. This gives me an idea

1663
04:07:12,790 --> 04:07:16,069
If you record a video with him, it might help him recover his memory this way

1664
04:07:16,389 --> 04:07:19,030
He will be able to tell us what happened to the tide this morning

1665
04:07:26,260 --> 04:07:28,260

Okay. Um

1668
04:07:37,409 --> 04:07:41,729
If this was real, I would say this i'd be full of energy. I'd be pretty much panicking at this

1669
04:07:42,450 --> 04:07:44,760
Your phone rings you can't get any peace

1670
04:07:46,370 --> 04:07:47,969
I mean, I would say

1671
04:07:47,969 --> 04:07:50,290
I would just probably laugh about that like who's calling me. I don't know

1672
04:07:50,930 --> 04:07:53,110
You thank you followers for the support

1673
04:07:53,190 --> 04:07:55,430

This is a restaurant. This is still trending. I have to get it. But while it's still trending

1683
04:08:54,680 --> 04:08:59,350
I'm not going to screw this up fish and then eat a raw fish in front of this guy

04:11:55,590 --> 04:11:57,639
bad

1702
04:11:57,639 --> 04:12:00,360
Poltergeist appears and I flatter myself

1703
04:12:01,000 --> 04:12:04,440
Is it worse than the last one?

1704
04:12:04,440 --> 04:12:06,280
Spam my instagram

1705
04:12:06,280 --> 04:12:16,309
God damn it. I don't care

1706
04:12:17,840 --> 04:12:20,399
I I thought something happened to him that just scared the shit out of me

1707
04:12:21,120 --> 04:12:24,280
I just heard like a I heard like a firing like a shot

1708
04:12:25,079 --> 04:12:28,159
And I remember everything that was fucking terrifying. That was so loud

1709
04:12:28,959 --> 04:12:35,510
Now I remember something savage happened this morning. I was recording an epic video when suddenly the sea turned into a swirling portal

1710
04:12:37,889 --> 04:12:40,370
Gosh, it swallowed me up and then spat me out on the dock of the city

1711
04:12:41,170 --> 04:12:45,569
In the morning, I heard that a certain captain vane the fisherman's owner is repairing an old boat

1712
04:12:46,450 --> 04:12:48,450
And he convinced him to lend it to me

1713
04:12:48,610 --> 04:12:52,760
If I sail out to sea I can jump into the whirlpool. This will close the portal

1714
04:12:53,319 --> 04:12:57,239
I will return to my dimension and the danger for new tube city will be over

1715
04:12:57,959 --> 04:13:02,159
Can I get can I get a selfie?

Slow filler word. It's so easy to do

04:13:53,030 --> 04:13:56,680
And you're like in class at like college or high school with so many teachers like

1725
04:13:57,239 --> 04:13:59,959
Yeah, so we got um, if you take a look at the algorithm on the board here

1726
04:14:00,520 --> 04:14:03,959
It's four or five x and then you're solving for uh

1727
04:14:05,190 --> 04:14:07,190

1728
04:14:07,270 --> 04:14:09,350

Walk in while looking at you and i'm gonna walk out

1822
04:27:03,620 --> 04:27:21,520
You don't have a vip card. You can't go through. What's this? Where is it? Where's my vip card? Can I get one?

1823
04:27:23,520 --> 04:27:25,120
This is embarrassing

1824
04:27:25,120 --> 04:27:27,360
I got a vip card, didn't I?

1825
04:27:27,920 --> 04:27:33,239
You don't have the exclusive customer card. It's for a different it's for a restaurant

1826
04:27:36,680 --> 04:27:40,840
Did I just get a punch card where if you buy like eight smoothies you get the ninth one for free

1827
04:27:41,319 --> 04:27:44,440
Is that what I got the equivalent? What do you mean?

1828
04:28:02,469 --> 04:28:03,670
burger boy

1829
04:28:03,670 --> 04:28:05,350
burger boy used to

1830
04:28:05,350 --> 04:28:10,069
So there was places those places that you get like it punches a card for like a sandwich or a drink or something

1831
04:28:10,870 --> 04:28:12,530
burger boy

1832
04:28:12,530 --> 04:28:18,370
Would ask everybody if they wanted something. Oh, hey, i'm gonna make a run. I'm gonna get i'm gonna go get drinks

1833
04:28:19,010 --> 04:28:20,840
anybody want anything

1834
04:28:20,840 --> 04:28:24,280
so he could like

1835
04:28:24,280 --> 04:28:27,319
Like punch the card like five to six times

1836
04:28:28,360 --> 04:28:30,360
And like I got I got everybody's stuff

1837
04:28:30,680 --> 04:28:32,680
And he would like get free shit

1838
04:28:37,219 --> 04:28:44,549
Those are the strats. Yeah, they are they really are. All right, there's the retro thing right here. How much is the console?

1839
04:28:46,899 --> 04:29:01,000
$2,000 for a sega dreamcast. I can't play this unless I have this console though. I don't what can I just own the game?

1840
04:29:05,239 --> 04:29:13,409
Mess in the new world. This is for this is a different console. Where do I get the atari?

1841
04:29:13,889 --> 04:29:20,040
Is it can I come back a different day?

1842
04:29:20,440 --> 04:29:45,809
Oh city hall's trending

1843
04:29:45,809 --> 04:29:55,190
I whatever get a picture of me. I have a dream class

1844
04:29:56,950 --> 04:29:58,389
Words are impossible

1845
04:29:58,389 --> 04:30:03,590
Carry out a procedure. What procedure do you want to perform?

1846
04:30:10,959 --> 04:30:14,760
Well, the marriage doesn't seem to be in our records. You could well you can get married

1847
04:30:15,399 --> 04:30:25,059
Why would it give me an option to record?

1848
04:30:25,059 --> 04:30:36,719
Please remind everyone to call their mothers and tell them I love you. Yeah

1849
04:30:37,360 --> 04:30:41,840
Call your mother call your mother. Let's go

1850
04:30:45,479 --> 04:30:48,389
All right, uh

1851
04:30:48,389 --> 04:30:52,389
I don't I can't afford this and it's not even the right console. So how am I supposed to do this?

1852
04:30:53,030 --> 04:30:56,879
I guess we're gonna go

1853
04:30:56,879 --> 04:31:01,959
We have to go to this er tech place, which I think is over here. Yeah, we're gonna go here

1854
04:31:01,959 --> 04:31:03,479
We're gonna upgrade the drone

1855
04:31:03,479 --> 04:31:14,690
What about the disco?

1856
04:31:14,690 --> 04:31:18,610
Wake her up at four in the morning. No call you call when you next available when

1857
04:31:19,250 --> 04:31:27,430
You don't not like right the second. I mean just next available. Hey, what brings you here?

1858
04:31:27,989 --> 04:31:30,040
I want to be able to stream

1859
04:31:30,040 --> 04:31:33,399
I see you want to upgrade your drone with the streaming function many youtubers wanted

1860
04:31:33,799 --> 04:31:36,930
You have to go to the workshop at the back and buy the streaming function

1861
04:31:39,719 --> 04:31:40,520
oof

1862
04:31:40,520 --> 04:31:41,399
oh

1863
04:31:41,399 --> 04:31:42,120

1864
04:31:42,120 --> 04:31:43,620
oh

1865
04:31:43,620 --> 04:32:05,829
I was a pussy. I look at that. All right streaming. It's two thousand bucks. God damn it. It's misspelled

1866
04:32:06,389 --> 04:32:08,389
What the fuck was that? It's misspelled

1867
04:32:08,629 --> 04:32:27,940
I was doing an extreme overreaction to oh my god. I found a typo. That's pretty rich coming from you

1868
04:32:27,940 --> 04:32:29,940
That's my point because it's who cares

1869
04:32:39,110 --> 04:32:43,030
Everything you do is in it. Where's the restaurant where I have the vip punch card?

1870
04:32:43,590 --> 04:32:58,069
It's almost time to go to the convention

1871
04:32:58,069 --> 04:33:04,259
Subway, we're going to do the boat thing. I can't afford to buy the streaming thing. It's two thousand

1872
04:33:04,259 --> 04:33:17,479
I don't have enough. Do you have a tiktok? No

1873
04:33:18,040 --> 04:33:30,069
No, but I guarantee you if I did i'd be huge not this again

04:33:48,580 --> 04:33:53,119
Convince somebody let him use his boat

1877
04:33:53,119 --> 04:33:58,979
Somebody posted your ass on tiktok and I got 50 000 likes

1878
04:33:59,380 --> 04:34:03,380
Okay, but you don't you don't think that I could come up with something

1879
04:34:03,939 --> 04:34:13,750
I mean we're talking about me here one of the most coordinated ow my fucking hand

A minimum gold league level is required. I can't use a ladder

04:35:29,909 --> 04:35:36,689
It's one of the only copies of that game they had

1892
04:35:37,090 --> 04:35:44,740
There are plenty of other people to speak to in the neighborhood, you know, go fire some asparagus

Recently arrived in town. You're a youtuber and a great future awaits you. How do you know that?

1897
04:36:11,959 --> 04:36:13,959
I'm good at reading people. My name is cerulean

1898
04:36:18,159 --> 04:36:20,560
You know, I can see you're a good person, but I didn't come here to make friends

1899
04:36:21,119 --> 04:36:30,479
You guys see this guy's boat

1900
04:36:30,479 --> 04:36:32,240
Anywhere that I have to convince?

1901
04:36:32,240 --> 04:36:34,709
I don't understand

1902
04:36:34,709 --> 04:36:42,000
What is it remind me again? What's going on?

1903
04:36:44,259 --> 04:36:51,959
Right rainer needs to repair old captain's veins

1904
04:36:52,840 --> 04:36:54,840
old captain vane's boat

1905
04:36:56,639 --> 04:36:58,479
Who's captain vane?

1906
04:36:58,479 --> 04:37:13,590
Is it listed on one of these?

1907
04:37:23,409 --> 04:37:31,279
No, what the fuck?

1908
04:37:31,360 --> 04:37:34,479
It's 4 a.m. Wait, am I actually gonna get pass out?

1909
04:37:35,119 --> 04:37:41,750
Let me get my head on the bar

1910
04:37:41,750 --> 04:37:43,029
What happens?

1911
04:37:43,029 --> 04:38:01,970
Last night you fell asleep in the street

1912
04:38:01,970 --> 04:38:06,759
Do I always have to go around looking out for you to check that nothing has been stolen from your backpack

1913
04:38:06,759 --> 04:38:08,549
I didn't have anything

1914
04:38:08,549 --> 04:38:10,549
Now on remember to return home before 4 a.m

1915
04:38:12,680 --> 04:38:17,889
Oh, i've been watching your videos and I have to say you have to do something with this place

1916
04:38:18,610 --> 04:38:21,490
Room decor and even the clothes you wear influence how your followers react

1917
04:38:22,150 --> 04:38:24,950
They'll like your videos more if you decorate your home in your own style

1918
04:38:25,669 --> 04:38:30,150
Tried that savior tried that and it became a thing that everybody made fun of

1919
04:38:31,720 --> 04:38:37,750
I put a lot of work into the reddit shelf back here and I showed them and they made fun of me for a month straight

1920
04:38:39,009 --> 04:38:48,500
So, I don't know where you're getting your information, but it's it's outdated. Okay, there's I have an amazon app on my phone

1921
04:38:49,060 --> 04:39:04,279
Where is it? I can buy anything I want on amazon what we got

1922
04:39:08,360 --> 04:39:17,680
Oh, wait, I can just order this is so much better. Okay, nice

1923
04:39:19,009 --> 04:39:27,540
This is I this is a thousand times better ram cookie. You can build a pc

1924
04:39:28,259 --> 04:39:45,380
It's amazing on not amazon. Okay. Um, I still don't understand this captain shit. I'm just gonna go to sleep for two days

1925
04:40:02,720 --> 04:40:10,959
Silent the raccoon is huge. What's it for the privilege to have me as a follower?

1926
04:40:10,959 --> 04:40:27,240
If you don't upload anything you're going to end up with an unfollow my friend. Appreciate the feedback

1927
04:40:28,659 --> 04:40:30,659
Okay, uh

1928
04:40:33,090 --> 04:40:47,959
What is silent the raccoon? I don't uh silent the raccoon. Oh, what is it?

1929
04:40:50,159 --> 04:40:52,159
Must be a retro game or something, right?

1930
04:40:52,479 --> 04:40:59,810
Damn it

1931
04:40:59,810 --> 04:41:13,650
Shit retro game. Yeah, but I don't I consoles are hard to get

1932
04:41:14,209 --> 04:41:34,610
Go to the fisherman's store. I will let me just see if I can get this console they have silent the raccoon

1933
04:41:35,970 --> 04:41:57,459
I can get it here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on

1934
04:41:58,020 --> 04:42:04,869
Where's that little stall? Where's this shit?

1935
04:42:08,040 --> 04:42:10,549
Come on silent the raccoon

1936
04:42:10,549 --> 04:42:12,229
Ooh

1937
04:42:12,229 --> 04:42:14,950
And it's for the the zega max drive

1938
04:42:15,990 --> 04:42:21,330
Oh my god, buy it

1939
04:42:21,330 --> 04:42:31,830
Oh my goodness. What is this? I'm out. What's trending today besides that dancing challenge easter and gameplay

1940
04:42:33,189 --> 04:42:36,549
This could be the biggest video i've ever made. All right dancing challenge. I gotta find that

1941
04:42:37,110 --> 04:42:45,080
Is this dancing challenge?

1942
04:42:45,080 --> 04:42:57,590
No, it's the mayor dancing challenge

1943
04:43:01,400 --> 04:43:15,830
Nope. Nope. It's probably in the I don't know. Is it easy vote for worst dream? I don't know. What are you talking about?

1944
04:43:16,150 --> 04:43:20,520
I just burped really hard down in my deep in my body. What are you?

1945
04:43:23,240 --> 04:43:26,360
And we already went over this

1946
04:43:26,360 --> 04:43:29,240
You can't know worst stream does not mean I don't like the game

1947
04:43:34,770 --> 04:43:45,250
Yeah, there I could name you probably three or four streams this year. That were way worse. I'm having fun

1948
04:43:45,490 --> 04:43:50,689
I'm having a good time having a blast. Actually, this is actually really fun. I'm having a ton of fun

1949
04:43:51,169 --> 04:43:53,409
How dare you by the way, how dare you?

1950
04:43:58,950 --> 04:44:00,950
All right. Where am I? Where am I going?

1951
04:44:02,130 --> 04:44:13,169
I have the console. I need to find a dancing competition. I would imagine that would be right in the middle of downtown

1952
04:44:13,650 --> 04:44:20,150
This is a dancing competition out here. This looks like dancing

1953
04:44:21,380 --> 04:44:23,459
It's not it doesn't look like a competition to me

1954
04:44:24,180 --> 04:44:33,270
Oh, I don't even care. I'm just gonna make the video

1955
04:44:37,090 --> 04:44:44,520
Dollhouse streams are worse than this

1956
04:44:49,349 --> 04:44:54,419
All right. I have the console. Let's do it. Take that down

1957
04:44:55,430 --> 04:45:04,580
One two, let's go. We're doing a gameplay video of silent the raccoon

1958
04:45:04,979 --> 04:45:21,279
See if we can get this trending let out a whoa find a bug make a technical comment about the bug

1959
04:45:22,360 --> 04:45:35,400
Why is this not filling up at all? This is literally a zero video one star video. Why is this filling so slowly?

1960
04:45:38,360 --> 04:46:31,220
Serious, it's too many cuts. This is gonna be demonetized. I just won't use that one. Whatever just click bait

1961
04:46:31,299 --> 04:46:42,639
Who cares if I ever okay 150 dislikes?

1962
04:46:44,610 --> 04:46:48,930
That's just that's that was all I thought that was really bad when I was making youtube videos

1963
04:46:52,689 --> 04:46:58,119
If a video had more than one to two hundred dislikes because there was always going to be

1964
04:46:59,919 --> 04:47:04,959
30 to 50 guaranteed dislikes no matter what it was nothing I could do about it

1965
04:47:04,959 --> 04:47:11,139
It was just guaranteed right but if a video had more than 150 dislikes 200 dislikes

1966
04:47:12,159 --> 04:47:18,689
That means that there were people that actually really did not like that video and whenever I would see that happen

1967
04:47:18,689 --> 04:47:22,290
I would have an internal crisis where I sit there and be like what the fuck did I do wrong?

1968
04:47:22,529 --> 04:47:25,439
What do I need? What do I do to fix this? That was was it bad?

1969
04:47:27,040 --> 04:47:38,470
Maybe i'll do another video tomorrow and make up for it. Thank god. You can't dislike a stream. Thank goodness

1970
04:47:38,790 --> 04:48:01,349
All right, the conventions today at 6k views though. Finally player one

1971
04:48:01,669 --> 04:48:06,400
Wait, is the convent like it's the 22nd, right?

1972
04:48:06,479 --> 04:48:12,240
I was watching a mouse fight with a piece of cheese on youtube today

1973
04:48:12,240 --> 04:48:16,799
And it was more fun than watching you do a gameplay buddy. The same person is just seriously like leave me alone

1974
04:48:17,119 --> 04:48:21,720

04:51:32,150 --> 04:51:42,000
In which year did I publish my first super strike brothers game 83? Oh 87

1997
04:51:44,340 --> 04:51:51,349
I think it's 83

1998
04:51:51,349 --> 04:51:56,209
Because uh, wasn't mario in um, what's it called wrecking crew?

1999

2023
04:55:14,159 --> 04:55:52,419
I'm looking forward to trying out all the games, but I don't know if i'll have time for them all

2024
04:55:55,490 --> 04:55:57,959
Real tweet

2025
04:55:57,959 --> 04:56:01,240
Stop doing that pose. I can't this is the one thing that looks I like it

2026
04:56:01,799 --> 04:56:06,419
I'm sorry. You need the vip pass to get into this private room, of course

2027
04:56:07,220 --> 04:56:10,500
You need to be a goal. So these are gold league youtubers

2028
04:56:11,220 --> 04:56:19,319
It's supposed to be awful to stand like they're like this the whole time

2029
04:56:19,959 --> 04:56:26,439
Can I sneak over there and get a vlog as a place to film?

2030
04:56:33,479 --> 04:57:03,590
human zoo

2031
04:57:03,590 --> 04:57:10,360
Okay. All right. Let's go make a tutorial. I'm going to talk about my experience at playcon

2032
04:57:13,750 --> 04:57:30,049
Wait, no, fuck doing an interview now. We're gonna go do a tutorial on

2033
04:57:31,639 --> 04:57:51,110
That trending game and that was 500 coins. It was way too expensive five hours

2034
04:57:54,209 --> 04:57:59,779
So the plan is don't let me let me get like the the plan going up here into halloween. So here's what we're gonna do

2035
04:58:00,259 --> 04:58:06,130
so tomorrow, uh italics night we're talking about playing that, uh

2036
04:58:06,610 --> 04:58:11,889
Manamadan game we were like this a couple things we were thinking about playing but that's one of them on the list

2037
04:58:12,290 --> 04:58:14,849
Either that or something else. We'll figure it out

2038
04:58:14,930 --> 04:58:16,930
Uh, there is one

2039
04:58:17,680 --> 04:58:23,080
Scenario where there might not be a stream tomorrow and i'm gonna give you it's like probably like a five percent chance

2040
04:58:23,759 --> 04:58:26,779
I'll tell you what it is. I just started taking an antibiotic

2041
04:58:29,139 --> 04:58:34,150
And I I don't know if it's gonna make me feel like shit. We'll find out but we'll see

2042
04:58:35,279 --> 04:58:37,729
so um

2043
04:58:37,729 --> 04:58:42,119
It hates streaming. It's a 100 chance. No

2044
04:58:43,619 --> 04:58:48,180
All right plan on there being no stream tomorrow because when there is I get to say there was one

2045
04:58:48,259 --> 04:58:53,590
Okay, do not mix it with avocados. I'm not eating avocados. What are you talking about?

2046
04:58:55,590 --> 04:59:04,099
But anyways darkest dungeon 2 comes out like in a couple days. I'm gonna play that on friday and then saturday

2047
04:59:04,950 --> 04:59:07,110
We're gonna do public domain movie night 2

2048
04:59:08,869 --> 04:59:17,439
Day before halloween. So there's probably gonna be a stream tomorrow me and italics gonna play something. We'll see again

2049
04:59:17,759 --> 04:59:23,270
I'm on an antibiotic last time I took an antibiotic. I had diarrhea and i'm just telling you let's be honest

2050
04:59:23,270 --> 04:59:39,560
I don't care how many people are here watching. I'm very honest incredibly honest person. How much longer you think I should scream?

2051
04:59:39,560 --> 04:59:43,650
I'm

2052
04:59:43,650 --> 04:59:48,290
Why am I asking you that why am I asking let me get to top 50 let me get to top 50

2053
04:59:48,770 --> 05:00:02,130
I don't know why I thought that was so funny

2054
05:00:02,590 --> 05:00:11,380
Nintendo next when I get to top 50 youtuber i'm done checking out insta life and seeing that you posted a new photo

2055
05:00:11,380 --> 05:00:17,400
Is the best you're too good 100. Hey, thanks. I got some footage to edit

2056
05:00:17,959 --> 05:00:31,729
No, just throw this one away

2057
05:00:31,729 --> 05:00:35,490
Just toss this video the smoke coming from your computer. This doesn't look good

2058
05:00:36,529 --> 05:00:53,889
You should change that part to continue using the computer what i'm done. See you guys probably tomorrow. See you guys tomorrow. Have a great night

2059
05:01:02,099 --> 05:01:04,450
30 90

2060
05:01:04,450 --> 05:01:10,119
No, actually, it's been pretty good so far. Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow

2061
05:01:10,279 --> 05:01:14,139
Look if there's an event where I have to not stream because i'm stupid antibiotic

2062
05:01:14,680 --> 05:01:17,639
And that's what's gonna happen, but it's planned for tomorrow. We're gonna do something tomorrow

2063
05:01:18,119 --> 05:01:28,000
Keep an eye on the sus tomorrow. I think that's pretty much all I want out of this game. It was fun. It means you're too weak

2064
05:01:29,400 --> 05:01:32,720
No, i'm not too weak. I had a good time. I thought that was actually really funny

2065
05:01:35,220 --> 05:01:45,520
Why are your streams not in 1080p? Well, that's a bit rate. Not enough. Yep twitch

2066
05:01:46,389 --> 05:02:01,540
Yep, that's why you should eat yogurt or take a probiotic to help with diarrhea

2067
05:02:02,919 --> 05:02:18,639
Uh, yeah, actually have a probiotic. That wasn't a sarcastic. Yeah, that was a yeah. I have a probiotic in right here

2068
05:02:19,360 --> 05:02:22,979
Not right here. That makes it sound like I made that up. There's a probiotic I have

2069
05:02:23,700 --> 05:02:28,680
Available to me that i'm taking are these old people problems?

2070
05:02:31,200 --> 05:02:37,250
Well, they're currently me problems right now because I don't know if you guys remember before the dollhouse stream

2071
05:02:37,569 --> 05:02:40,130
I want some streamer insight here before we go

2072
05:02:41,119 --> 05:02:42,580
um

2073
05:02:42,580 --> 05:02:47,360
the day before I had to get on the plane I

2074
05:02:49,060 --> 05:02:52,360
Had to get an MRI of my brain. It was incredibly stressful

2075
05:02:52,919 --> 05:02:54,419
because I had

2076
05:02:54,419 --> 05:02:55,619
this weird

2077
05:02:55,619 --> 05:02:57,439
pressure in my head

2078
05:02:57,439 --> 05:02:59,279
And I was really dizzy

2079
05:02:59,279 --> 05:03:01,279
I'm kind of like uneasy feeling

2080
05:03:01,759 --> 05:03:03,759
I talked about it a little bit when I came back

2081
05:03:04,369 --> 05:03:06,400
but

2082
05:03:06,400 --> 05:03:12,310
It was a really really awful thing to have happen right in the middle of that project

2083
05:03:13,639 --> 05:03:15,720
So that was a really really really

2084
05:03:17,500 --> 05:03:23,889
TLDR, but I don't want to get into it. Um, I have this problem with my sinuses. I have

2085
05:03:24,610 --> 05:03:26,209
cysts in my sinus

2086
05:03:26,209 --> 05:03:32,319
Yeah, I think they're in both of them. The max are we already talking about it, you know, so um

2087
05:03:33,060 --> 05:03:35,590
It looks like I have a little bit of an infection up there

2088
05:03:35,590 --> 05:03:39,349
So we're going to do an antibiotic for the infection and see if anything else has to happen

2089
05:03:41,569 --> 05:03:49,650
I am completely fine. By the way, like I'm fine. Don't worry. It's just an annoyance that happened a month or two ago

2090
05:03:49,970 --> 05:04:00,290
I'm good. Don't worry. I'm 100 fine and I'm not even sure if that's exactly what's going on

2091
05:04:00,290 --> 05:04:03,090
But that is what is being investigated now

2092
05:04:04,610 --> 05:04:09,409
So again, I'm completely fine. I'm 100 healthy right now

2093
05:04:09,970 --> 05:04:22,560
Don't worry. Thanks for the subs, by the way, that was a good time

2094
05:04:23,340 --> 05:04:25,040
youtubers life too

2095
05:04:25,040 --> 05:04:30,560
Currently on steam if you care we got to hang out with pewdiepie, which was that was pretty cool

2096
05:04:31,360 --> 05:04:39,680
Have a wonderful rest of your night. We'll see you probably tomorrow

2097
05:04:40,319 --> 05:06:09,409
Keep an eye on us

2098
05:06:09,490 --> 05:06:21,200
Right, it's monkey s didn't I run them. I thought yeah, I ran them. I did the credits

2099
05:06:24,130 --> 05:06:29,110
Yeah, I did

2100
05:06:29,110 --> 05:06:33,200
All right. This is part where I scream and then hit the end screen button. All right, let's try it

2101
05:06:35,060 --> 05:06:37,430
I really want to try to get cut off

2102
05:06:37,430 --> 05:06:39,430
If I can get cut off mid sentence or something
