1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:16,280
Hey, it's here. It's finally here. It's here. Let's freaking go! Let's freaking go!

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:30,940
Hey guys, how you doing? Are you guys ready for Elden Ring? I am. I'm very prepared.

3
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:40,539
I'm- I came the most prepared I've been to any livestream you've ever seen.

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,600
Except for obviously like, you know, the- the event ones, right?

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:52,340
This is the most prepared I've been for a gaming stream in six and a half years. I had a big salad

6
00:00:52,899 --> 00:01:01,030
with like olive oil and radishes and lettuce. It's- I've- I have all bunch of nutrients.

7
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:09,379
I'm drinking a matcha powder vitamin b drink. It's super hydrating. I- I- this is the most

8
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:17,750
prepared I've ever been in my life. This thing is probably 40 ounces by the way. Oh, I don't care.

9
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:27,540
Hey, that's not- what are you to- no. Get in here and say, let's freaking go! What the fuck?

10
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:34,579
This is- this is- okay. What? This is like a huge deal. This- this is like- okay. You want to know

11
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:40,549
why this is a big deal? Have you guys seen the reviews for this game? This apparently is like

12
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,040
masterpiece. Like better than Bloodborne. I'm gonna hold my reservations on this. I'm gonna wait to

13
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,819
give my kind of honest opinion on this game. But people are talking about how it's- it's like

14
00:01:52,819 --> 00:02:01,540
the ocarina of time of this generation. So, holy shit, that's quite an achievement potentially.

15
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:11,990
In a world of a lot of disappointing AAA releases over the last year or two,

16
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:20,780
this is a big deal if it's good. I have no idea what I'm gonna play as. I know there's all these

17
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,259
classes. I got a notepad here. I'm gonna have like a notepad on screen that I can- because

18
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,460
you're supposed to- you gotta keep track of what you're doing because there's no quest markers or

19
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:39,099
anything. But I've been looking forward to this. I liked Sekiro, but I didn't love Sekiro. Yeah,

20
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:47,259
I wasn't like a massive fan of that game. So, if this is anything like the previous kind of

21
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:54,550
Souls games, if this is like an open world Dark Souls type game, then I mean, I don't know what

22
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,389
to tell you besides this could be the best game I've ever played. Bloodborne is up there at like

23
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:03,189
number one or number two for favorite game of all time. If this thing runs at 60 fps,

24
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:10,460
it's open world Bloodborne essentially. Open world Dark Souls. I'm- I gotta- I have to quell my

25
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:18,340
hype here because I'm- you know I like these games, right? But I don't know. I'm very excited.

26
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:32,379
I'm incredibly excited because Sekiro beat you. Yeah. Sekiro was really hard. It was.

27
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:40,759
I remember the last boss of Sekiro was, what, an entire two streams or at least a full like

28
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:48,620
six or seven hours straight. There was a point after like hour number four or five where I just-

29
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,139
I was like, I'm not gonna finish this. This is not gonna happen. It will not happen.

30
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:06,139
It absolutely will not happen. I'm not gonna waste any more time. The stream is ready. The game is

31
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:11,930
ready. I don't- I think I'm gonna start in offline mode because I really don't want to uh-

32
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,220
I- I kind of want to like enjoy the world. I don't want to get like invaded.

33
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:29,480
I like- Balsack 500 is gonna come and like kill me in three hits. That's my opinion on the- on the

34
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:38,139
Ukraine. Uh, yeah. I'll give you one small little thing that I just- it's- it sucks. And it's- it's

35
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:44,259
really really saddening to know that, I don't know, we're still doing this shit. People are still

36
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:51,160
fucking killing each other and shit. It's- it's not fu- it's bad. And as much as I would like to

37
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,980
sit here and tell you and talk about it, just really hope that- I mean, uh, I don't have to be

38
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,980
the first person to tell you, but I'm honestly gonna just try to escape from it. That's the whole

39
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,579
point of this stream. Um, I'm sure a lot of you guys have been up pretty much like I was late last

40
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:15,379
night. Kind of just looking over it, going over the whole situation and going like, what the fuck,

41
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:21,050
man, what is happening? I obviously feel for the people of Ukraine, it's fucking awful.

42
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,560
I just really really hope this doesn't turn into something even more sinister and awful.

43
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:43,740
But that's all we can do, right? That's all we can do. So without further ado, um, we're gonna

44
00:05:43,740 --> 00:06:08,839
play Elden Ring. Here we go. I think a seven's fine. Seven's good. I think that looks good.

45
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:20,550
This looks good. Yeah, I- I don't want to speak too much on it just because, obviously,

46
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,670
I use this stream as a way to escape myself and I've made comments about that in the past during

47
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:33,110
other kind of times of, um, of uncertainty and of real like kind of pain in the world and really

48
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,600
shitty stuff happening in the world. So like I've made previous comments and statements that this

49
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:47,850
stream is a place for me to get away from it. So that's how I'm gonna treat it. What fucking

50
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:55,339
class am I gonna play? I- I tried to figure this out. I was desperately trying to think of what

51
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:58,459
class I wanted to start with. I know that like all these- it doesn't matter, right?

52
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:06,500
Because I was thinking this game has like magic. It's a magic game where like everybody has like

53
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,129
spells and abilities and stuff. But also you can be a caster. You can be a straight-up caster.

54
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,269
But I don't know if I want to do that because I don't want to beat Cheese Andy on my first

55
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:23,060
playthrough. Because you guys know that with every one of these Souls games, there's gonna

56
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,540
be one magic move that you can get like halfway through the game that will like two hit kill every

57
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,699
boss, right? I mean it's the first week the game's out. That's probably gonna happen.

58
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:41,240
Samurai, all right. Let me see. Show stats. Oh, that's better. All right, where's just like the

59
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,050
default- I thought that guy was actually naked. I was just like, holy shit, they really don't care,

60
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:56,379
huh? Prophet? All right, so let me- let me see what these stats are. This is the faith class,

61
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:09,480
right? Astrologer is the sorcerer. Bandit. Arcane. Okay, arcane is not like plus damage to any spells

62
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,879
or anything, right? Samurai? Samurai? All right, what are other streamers doing? Because I want

63
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,300
to do the exact opposite of that because I want to be like Contrary and Andy. I want to be the guy

64
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,459
that's playing the one thing that everybody else isn't. So when people scroll through the like

65
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:29,399
50,000 streams of this game, I can put in my title. Bandit gameplay! And they'll come to my stream

66
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:39,500
instead. I don't want to do the- no, I'm not doing this one. No, I want to start with a weapon. I

67
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,389
don't want to start with the club. I haven't watched anybody, okay? Prisoner. Prisoner is

68
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:58,090
kind of like everything. It's intelligence, dexterity. That's kind of- Battle Mage?

69
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,179
What are the weapons there? Prophet. I don't really usually play the faith-based

70
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:13,129
stuff in any of these From Software games. I- should I just be- spell it? I should- maybe

71
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:20,789
I should be spells. Should I be a sorcerer? I feel like that's cheating though. Or should I just do

72
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:26,490
Vagabond, which is just- okay, you just use sword and hit things. Do the confessor.

73
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:35,860
That's kind of cool, but it's faith. I don't really like to play faith. I think prisoner

74
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:43,399
might be up my alley as well as- no, not necessarily samurai. Prisoner? All right,

75
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm telling you, I'm leaning towards prisoner, astrologer, or bandit. I can't decide. This is

76
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,059
my first playthrough too. Like, this is the worst part. I don't know what I want to do.

77
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:05,370
Do a poll? All right, we're gonna do a poll in the chat right now,

78
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:12,789
because I would do any one of those three. We've got bandit, we've got prisoner, and we've got

79
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:28,360
astrologer. Again, prisoner is kind of like a battle mage. Astrologer is spells only. Bandit is,

80
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:39,450
I think, like decks? Like quick stuff? Maybe ranged? Bows? Daggers? What are we doing? Oh,

81
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:53,429
this is unanimous. Play as classic sonic. Oh, that's cheating, because the guy has a-

82
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:57,580
the guy has a- wait, wait, wait, wait, back, back, back, how do I hit back? That's cheating.

83
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,740
The guy has like a hat on. Yeah, the guy's got like a weird helmet on. That is actually cheating.

84
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:16,980
Oh no, they're picking the guy with like the hat, like the weird metal hat thing. That's probably

85
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,179
what I was going to pick anyways, I'll be honest, because I like casting spells, but I like swinging

86
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:25,379
too. All right, we're going prisoner. Let's go. A lot of decks, a lot of intelligence. All right,

87
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:39,419
let's do it. Please choose a body type. Type A or type B? What's the difference? Type A? Name.

88
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:55,850
Ooh, actually looks pretty cool. Name. Oh, we need a good name. Frogman, Frogman Jr. I think this is

89
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:15,940
going to be Frogman's legacy. Didn't choose B. I don't know what B is, but um, hmm, Flash.

90
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:28,600
Flash. That's like a, that's like a Sonic OC character name. Um, Edward. Oh shit,

91
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:38,120
that's actually an awesome name. Edward is a good name. Yeah, I think that's perfect. Okay, that's

92
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,750
a good- okay, body type. Yeah, that's what I want. Edward. Okay, body type A or B. Okay, we're going

93
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,059
to go bigger. Age, we'll do, uh, I always do Aged. Origin Pro- oh, what, what's the point of that?

94
00:12:52,059 --> 00:13:01,240
Actually, I can see this better. So, intelligence. Spells are affected by dexterity as well.

95
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,409
Dexterity is cast speed, I think. I did my research, don't think I didn't. So, this build

96
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:15,269
looks like you want to do- and I don't know what mind is. I think mind is uh, is mana. Keepsake.

97
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,990
Oh, I mean none of this really ever matters in these games, but let's find out. Lands between

98
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,029
ruin. The gold? Grace. Shining in the eyes of the people of the lands between. Used to- okay. So,

99
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,500
they changed the name of the experience stuff in every single one of these games, right?

100
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:38,809
So, ruins is just blood echoes, is just souls, right? Anything that I should get? Golden seed?

101
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:46,629
It does matter. It usually doesn't. Golden seed washed ashore from the lands between.

102
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:51,700
Said to reinforce sacred flasks. I don't even- I don't know what any of this is. Imp ashes.

103
00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:02,820
Old spirits within. We need to facecam? You got it! Uh, cracked pot. I don't know. No, you don't

104
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:10,899
know? No, fuck that. No facecam. You guys might give me a facecam. Maybe if you're good. If you

105
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:18,139
guys are good, then I'll turn it on. Only if you're good. Looking for certain throne items.

106
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Two stone keys shaped like swords. Bricks. Oh, by the way, also I have this too.

107
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:33,370
Like, I can write down like, uh, found guy by tree in Anor Londo, right? Like, uh,

108
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:41,590
this game apparently has no help at all with quests. So, I need to be prepared to write some

109
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:51,059
stuff down. All right, bewitching brand. Originate from, I don't know, what is it? Five sacred

110
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:59,690
branches charged with eguiling power. Five pieces of boiled prawn. Boost physical damage. Oh,

111
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,049
physical damage negation. Okay, so this is like a- probably a temporary damage reducer.

112
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:13,340
Oops, I'm sorry I punched you. Notepad Andy. What? I- in case I need it. You know, this- dude,

113
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:19,259
I have been told that this is as hard to- this is like playing Monkey Island for the first time.

114
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:26,100
Before there was a game fax on it. I need to be prepared to know where like the bubble gum,

115
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:35,299
the shoe, and the combined stick and- and like tree branch go, okay? Like, I need to know what

116
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:38,820
the fuck this happens. I need to know how this works. I need to be able to write this stuff down.

117
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:54,259
Do game fax, not stop stalling. This is not- I'm- there's no stalling here. I'm trying to- I gotta-

118
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:59,539
All right, I'm picking the- I'm gonna pick the Crimson Amber Medallion, because like it's just

119
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:04,259
the- it's just the starting item that gives you a little bit more HP. You take all this shit off

120
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:15,539
anyways. Stalling. Imagine saying stalling in the first 20 minutes of any Dark Souls type game.

121
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,710
That's the whole point. You're supposed to make it like a character and pick- I- don't rush me,

122
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:26,230
okay? Don't rush me through this. This is a- I've been waiting for this game for 30 years.

123
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:40,759
Okay. All right, let's go with the aristocrat. All right, voice. Can I get a preview? Oh, sample.

124
00:16:45,620 --> 00:17:10,150
I like this one. Uh, I think this is good. This is fine. Fine. All right, hair and face.

125
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:18,779
Graphics look great. A structure. Oh god, this- I'm gonna be here for so long. I promise I won't be

126
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:23,420
here for that long, all right? Because I- I want to play the game really badly. I think we're just

127
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:44,490
gonna do random. You sit here with a helmet on half the time anyways. How do I do the- where's

128
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,619
the random random random random? It's gonna be two hours of this. No, it won't. I'll- okay.

129
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,579
I am gonna just do the one thing that I do in every video game. All we're gonna get to is

130
00:17:55,579 --> 00:18:00,220
the point where I get to the chin and the jaw and I make it big and huge. That's the only thing that

131
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,319
you ever care about, that I ever care about with any characters I've ever made, is just make the

132
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:11,500
guy's chin big like Thanos. That's it. That's a defining feature of every single character I've

133
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:32,970
ever made. No, we need deep, like right here. It kind of looks like me. Wait, did I- how did I do

134
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:44,220
that? It's not- my chin's not that long though. All right, that looks good. This actually- this

135
00:18:44,220 --> 00:19:00,630
is what I feel like I look like in the mirror. Okay. Oh my god, that looks weird. I like it.

136
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:17,400
Okay. Contouring. I kind of like that except we'll go like this. All right, never mind,

137
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:37,740
I'm gonna stay- I'm gonna be here for a little while. Ah, hmm. Dinner? Dinner? It's shaggy.

138
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:56,470
Oh no, it is. Mouth slant. Oh, occlusion? That's okay. Mouth protrusion? This is how far out the

139
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:11,609
mouth is. Let's go right there. Out the width. Pull back. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do iPad

140
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:27,180
photo booth guy. Nope. Or like every other filter on Snapchat. No. That makes him look a little too

141
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:47,460
normal. This feels like what every history book depiction of a peasant looks like. All right,

142
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:59,240
let's do lip shape. Expression. What does the other one look like? What does sad look like?

143
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:20,089
That's not really sad. How about this? Okay, I like that. Oh, I mean, is it funny? Yeah. But,

144
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:37,720
okay. Hold that back. Did somebody just say this guy looks like Ace Attorney? I didn't catch the

145
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:54,390
whole message. What? This does not look like Ace Attorney. Okay, cheeks. This is where it's gonna

146
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:11,140
get fun. All right, let's go all the way up. No, all the way down. Like right here. Kind of sad now.

147
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:31,829
All right, I like it. Well, he looks like he's like a hexagonal. Why is he like a hexagonal?

148
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:58,569
There's not enough polygons on this guy's face. No, that's too easy. Not that ridiculous. I want

149
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:33,400
him to at least, okay, right there. I'm gonna keep it for now. Okay. I'm gonna keep it for now,

150
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:49,289
but I can't promise it's gonna stay. He looks powerful. It does, it really does look like

151
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:55,259
Shaggy. It looks like Shaggy went to the county fair and had one of those caricatures

152
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:11,240
made where he's riding his surfboard on a wave. Or he's on a tandem bicycle with a Daphne or

153
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:33,619
something. No, that's way too much. That's way too much. We're pulling it back a little. This

154
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:44,839
looks like a joker. It does look like a joker. All right, nose height. Oh, it's not gonna be the nose

155
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:58,380
guy. That's fine. That's fine. I'm not doing anything else to it. Eyes. Okay. No, what's it?

156
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:25,609
Is this a DreamWorks character? It's like Coraline's dad. That looks okay. Goodness.

157
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:49,480
I like that. I think that's perfect. I like the wide. Wide is better. Like right there.

158
00:25:49,480 --> 00:26:04,200
Maybe not so much. Like that. All right, that's a really good start. Somebody said,

159
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,700
Shaggy from Scooby Doo after being hit with gamma particles. Like a Hulk?

160
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:39,000
Look at this one. Brow out. All right, he's slowly turning into the bird for the Muppets.

161
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,059
And I made that exact same joke the last time I played Dark Souls. So you better know I'm excited.

162
00:26:48,059 --> 00:27:10,309
Big forehead or no forehead at all. Like his eyebrows go into his hairline.

163
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:35,539
Forehead protrusion. Pull it back a little bit. Height. All right. Dude, my eyes are like this.

164
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:48,170
I got this huge eyebrows on. This just makes him sadder. All right, fine. All right, facial balance.

165
00:27:48,970 --> 00:28:06,920
Wait, what do you mean nose size? What? I'm gonna keep it here. Nose forehead ratio.

166
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:18,250
Face protrusion. That's too much. That's too cartoonish. Like right here.

167
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:26,890
I actually think it's perfect. I don't think I need to do anymore. We do have to do something

168
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:35,369
about the hair though, I think. Well, maybe the hair is perfect. All right, so let's go with hair.

169
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:53,480
What we got. Are you sure this is Shaggy with gamma rays and not Jerma? Jeremy with gamma rays?

170
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:09,380
That's what I feel like I did. I feel like it just made me. I like that. I like that too, a lot.

171
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:18,390
I like that way more than this one. It looks like one of the, like quote,

172
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:27,319
English band members in every fucking cartoon. He has a voice like this, guarantee it. Oh yeah,

173
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,240
he's got a voice like this. Guarantee it. All right, 12 is where we're at right now.

174
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:51,319
Although this is really good too. I like this one a lot. All right, 12, 13. This one's like

175
00:29:51,319 --> 00:30:08,250
too real. I don't like this one. No, I think it's either 12 or 13. All right, what do we think?

176
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:22,650
Is it cartoon English band member one or cartoon English band member two? 12 or 13? I could go with

177
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:41,099
either one. Yep, it's gonna be 12. Oh, it changed. It changed from cartoon English band member

178
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:51,529
to emo band member in one second. Oh, wait, hold on. I gotta change that.

179
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:06,359
I think it's gonna have to stay brown. I just, all right, this is just Criss Angel.

180
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:19,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's English cartoon band member. I mean, I could go back and

181
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:32,230
just make him a sorcerer, change his name to Mind Freak, and no, no, no, no. No, we're sticking with

182
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:55,049
what I had. Or Kiss band member. Yeah, I mean, I'm going with this. Lustre? Let's make him shiny.

183
00:31:55,049 --> 00:32:07,829
White hairs. Not too many. Maybe a few. That looks all right. Make him more greasy. No, I'm not

184
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:15,769
making it greasy. Eyebrows. You can't even see them, so who cares? Facial hair. All right,

185
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:26,170
this is a big deal. Oh, all right, this is actually, actually, this could be the one.

186
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:49,690
It could be six here. I think it's six. Yep, it's six. Match hair, match hair, stubble. What does

187
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:58,170
that mean? Oh, thick. Yeah, that's fine. Eyelashes. Can't see them. Eyes. Can't really see them, but

188
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:07,190
I mean, whatever. You can't see these. You literally cannot even see them, so it doesn't matter.

189
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:15,079
It doesn't matter. You can make his eyes like green or blue or what? I don't know.

190
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:33,180
Doesn't matter. You can't see them anyway. Bores. Skin lustre. Dark circles. You can't really see

191
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:54,119
them. Make it greasy. No. You can't really see that anyways. All right. Eye patches? No, you can't

192
00:33:54,119 --> 00:34:07,059
see this either. Eye patch. No, I'm not him. He's not getting an eye patch. All right, I think it's

193
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:25,380
done. I think we're ready. Now we need to do body. Wait, you can make him have a tiny head? Make sure

194
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:49,079
you have a small head? Where's all the body hair? I don't see it. Where is it? Yeah, body hair. Yeah,

195
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:57,690
I mean, it's kind of there. This is funny right now, but this is going to annoy. I'm going to

196
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:06,039
hate this in like an hour and a half. I'm going to hate this equally, right? It's too big.

197
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:25,380
No, it's not. It's not Eren Jaeger. It's not Eren Jaeger. Okay. It's kind of close. I'll give him

198
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,300
kind of a big head because I want to be able to see the helmets because it's cool. All right.

199
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,059
That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. I'm done. Done. It's over. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm

200
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:50,170
done. Okay. Save it. Was that it? Save to favorites. Save. Reset appearance. Yes. Okay. I think we're

201
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:56,679
good to go. See, look it. He's got the... You guys made me do all this stuff to put this fucking helmet

202
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:07,820
on him. All right. Are you guys ready to go? Wait, what does he look like as other characters?

203
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:34,469
Fuck. It's perfect. No. How many times have I said no in like 20 minutes? Relax. I'm going to get my

204
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:38,619
ass kicked. I'm doing... We're going to go with prisoner, but I'm going to take the helmet off.

205
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:54,199
All right. Are you ready? I'm ready to start Elden Ring. That's just a Titan. You can probably

206
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:59,829
hide the helmet. All right. I am ready to play. I've been waiting for this game for 100 years.

207
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:05,429
This is it. Let's go. Are you ready? Let's go. I'm fucking excited. I'm ready to go. I've been

208
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:14,860
waiting for this. I'm going to get a nice sip of my matcha green tea. All right. Cutscene incoming.

209
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:49,900
Let's go. Oh, yes. Pale blood, you say? Well, you've come to the right place. For the great

210
00:37:49,900 --> 00:38:17,929
Elden Ring was shattered. Fuck. In our cross the fog, the lands between Queen Marika the Eternal

211
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:37,780
is nowhere to be found. Godwin the was first to perish. Come on, Godwin. New meme. New meme

212
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:56,420
unlocked. Marika's offspring, demigods all claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. Taint

213
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:20,570
of their newfound strength triggered the shattering which no Lord arose. A war

214
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:40,170
leading to abandonment by the greater will. Oh, rise now, ye tarnished, ye dead who yet live.

215
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:59,940
Call of long-lost grace speaks to us all. Poor alone, chieftain of the Badlands,

216
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:15,500
ever-brilliant gold mask. Fear the deathbed companion, the loathsome dung-eater,

217
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:34,889
and Circadian Ophnia. We all know it. I have no idea what the fuck any of that was. I couldn't

218
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:50,840
follow any of it, but its art was really good. I should be writing all this down. No, I got the

219
00:40:50,840 --> 00:41:18,940
notepad, but I'm not gonna. The only thing you had to write down was dung-eater. For the Elden and

220
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:42,070
become the Elden Lord. All right. All right. Let's go. All right. New the Ring. Okay.

221
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:53,050
Just like, okay. What do we got? Let's test out the moves for a second.

222
00:41:53,849 --> 00:42:04,659
Okay. Oh shit. This guy's a fencer. I don't want to play a fencer. I'm gonna get my ass kicked.

223
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:19,460
I don't play. I never play with the fencing ever. Kind of restart. Oh, this is bad. Praise the Elden

224
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:29,300
Ring. I actually did not mean to rate that poor. I tried. I thought start was yes. I'm the one

225
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,659
person. I'm what? I'm such a contrarian. Well, I don't know that yet because I haven't played the

226
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:44,550
game yet. So I'm not going to praise it yet. Dislike tarnished, wisened finger. Okay. What does

227
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:51,820
that say? Well, the path be broken and uncertain. Claim your place as Elden Lord. So I'm supposed

228
00:42:51,820 --> 00:43:00,199
to be a Lord. All right. Be wary of message. Oh shit. I'm online right now. Is that bad? Seek

229
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:12,420
life. Okay. I'm gonna, I gotta play offline because I've quite look for secrets. Wait,

230
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:22,360
there's an actual jump button. No, there's not. Five fingers, butthole. Oh yeah. Great. Thanks.

231
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:36,489
What does this one say? I tried poop in face. That's it. There's a jump sprint. All right,

232
00:43:36,489 --> 00:44:01,019
let's go. Whoa. Well, chapel of anticipation. What's over here? This door is blocked shut.

233
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:25,780
All right. Wait, wait. Okay. Where's my, with my mouse door next to spawn. Where am I?

234
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:40,150
Door next to spawn is blocked shut. All right. That's all I need to know. What do you mean

235
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:45,829
cheating? No, what you've like, I, if I was this character, I wouldn't walk around with like a

236
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:54,360
pen and paper or something as I had ink back in like the 1200s. Okay. There's nothing wrong with

237
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:08,260
what I'm doing. Necessary item ahead. Is there actually, can I go down this ledge? Why can I

238
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:27,320
do this? I can walk over here for some reason. Why nothing down there? What did you do? Everyone

239
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:33,619
just walks off here and dies. I, okay. I'm not doing that. I'm not going to have the first fall

240
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:40,469
joke be an intentional fall joke. All right. Let's go. Camera controls. Yep. First off,

241
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:47,210
good luck. I keep saying poor and I'm trying to start should be yes. Wait, what's this? What's

242
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:58,340
that? What's down there? What's over here? All right. You will fall joke. Yeah, but not like right

243
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:12,519
now. Is there a lucieri walls in this game? Praise the roll. Okay. This is really pretty.

244
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:31,900
This is beautiful. Really? Can I, well, there was a, there's a way to jump up the ledge.

245
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:41,690
Is there a penalty for dying like in the other games? I hope not. All right. Let's go. Let's go.

246
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:52,820
Let's go. He actually did it. Well, they put a jump in the game. There has to be something over

247
00:46:52,820 --> 00:47:02,730
here and I'm going to take my time. Retrieve law. Oh, okay. From software doesn't just put stuff

248
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:12,550
like this for no reason. Is this just here for no reason? I'm going to miss something. All right.

249
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:30,460
Don't die in the same spot again. I'm going to try one more time. All right. For what? What does

250
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,539
this do? There's nothing. Okay. There's no reason to do what he just did. Let's go.

251
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:51,900
I like the compass though. That's very helpful. All right. Oh, all right. Is there, is there a

252
00:47:51,900 --> 00:48:10,329
champion Unger? No. What's his name? Ingir? Ingman? What's the guy's name at the very beginning?

253
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:15,320
Amphion Bunger? No, no, no. What's the guy's name in the beginning of Dark Souls three?

254
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:39,210
Ing... Gundyr? What did I say? Ungir? Undyr? Not Bunger. Gundyr. Gundyr. Unger. Undyr. Whatever

255
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:49,349
his name is. All right. You're distracting me. All right. There's nothing over here. It's just

256
00:48:49,349 --> 00:49:00,619
pretty. It's really sucks that I have this fencing weapon though. I have like this dung eater. Cool.

257
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:15,860
All right. Let's do it. Wait, what about over here? Barbecue, bacon, Bunger, Bunger? Nothing.

258
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:30,039
I know completionist Andy. I know, but I need to see what's over here. I like the statue.

259
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:37,909
This is definitely a... Yeah. I knew it. I knew there was going to be... I knew there was going

260
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:51,480
to be a Bunger. I knew it. How do I cast spells? How do you cast spells? It's not that one. All

261
00:49:51,480 --> 00:50:03,190
right. How do I cast spells? Not like that. I'm dead already. Oh, that's supposed to happen.

262
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:50,780
I don't even have a heal. Cool. Ooh, that was a bad voice crack, but I'm very excited. It's the

263
00:50:50,860 --> 00:51:31,860
horse. Nice. The Elden Ring is kind of a powerful thing, but you get it and you become a lord or

264
00:51:31,860 --> 00:52:02,949
something. I'm like that, I would assume. I just realized this helmet never can come off.

265
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:17,289
Your head can't come out of that hole. What? The Lask of Crimson Tears. All right. That's

266
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:29,719
definitely the Estus. That's just like in Dark Souls 3. Here's the two. There's the magic one.

267
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,579
Brave Tarnished, take the plunge of learning and remembrance. Oh, I was about to jump off.

268
00:52:45,769 --> 00:53:00,150
Recall the arts of war and your warrior's blood. What's that up there? A blood display. Wait,

269
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:08,760
you can... Whoa. Wait, how do I do that? That was interesting. Impaling thrust. What does that mean?

270
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:24,940
What? If only I had a pickle. You hold it. That's weird. That's kind of weird that it turns it off.

271
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:29,059
Okay, if only I had a pickle. Whatever. Can't get up there.

272
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:51,739
Oops. And go up. I don't think I'm going to go down just yet. Free thing. You hold tree. Praise the

273
00:53:51,739 --> 00:54:11,210
tree. Write that down. No, I don't have to write that down. Are you ready? But wait, am I taking

274
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:17,380
the plunge? I'm actually really glad that I accidentally just did that because I probably

275
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:30,420
would have got hurt a lot. Okay, cool. I think I would have died. All right, I'm going to use my

276
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:37,849
fencing thing. This is a cool looking cave though. Sites of grace. Resting at a site of grace will

277
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:42,900
restore your HP. Yeah, so this is bonfire. Restore his flasks. Yeah, most enemy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:52,860
Is there fast travel between them? Very little fall damage. Think secure. Really? Okay, that's

279
00:54:52,860 --> 00:55:03,530
good to know. Pass the time. Oh, that's right. There's a full day and night cycle where different

280
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:20,820
shit happens. Wow. Okay. All right. Well, here we go. Rest the camera. Do I have a parry? I don't.

281
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:28,309
How do I- Okay, that spells. Thank you. What's it doing? That takes a long ass time. Okay, how much

282
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:36,340
mana did that use? Is there a- Can I turn- Hold on. I know I'm going to break immersion here,

283
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:43,079
but is there a way that I can just make it so it doesn't turn the HUD off? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's

284
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:51,449
on. Keep it on. Yeah, I much prefer it like this. Sorry for your immersion. What is impaling thrust?

285
00:55:51,449 --> 00:56:00,940
Why is it on my HUD? You can memorize sorceries. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Must

286
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:13,159
have a staff. Uh-huh. Weapon art L2. All right, I see. I'm not going to use magic on these guys.

287
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:20,550
Why would I? Yeah, I know how to play. I just took- Okay, the tutorial did the thing and I had-

288
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:29,110
That's actually a really cool move though. From software, why did you- Hold on. What are you doing?

289
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:42,440
They're doing the thing. They're doing the pause mid-swing tutorial. What happened?

290
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:54,059
Oh, this is fucking beautiful. Who's that? I can do that too, you know. Is that going to hit him?

291
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:09,849
Oh, wow. That's good. Let's go. You have to drop something, right? Change the button prompts in

292
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:20,389
the PC. I actually don't mind why being- I think it's okay. You went down the combat tutorial hole

293
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:24,630
and you're complaining about tutorial. No, I'm just kidding. I'm actually just kidding.

294
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:37,079
Yeah, you can do it with two hands. Wait, what? I can't hold this in two hands.

295
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:52,199
I'm gonna hit him in the back. Oh, hell yeah. Swing. Swing. Swing at me. You dick. Really?

296
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:10,010
Wait, oh, I have a shield. I do have a shield. Okay, cool. Swing at me. I always hate fighting

297
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:23,780
the guys with big shields. They're annoying. I definitely want to- How do I- Because I do

298
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:31,079
want to hold this in two hands. Sometimes. Let me do that. Hold on. I know how to use the menu.

299
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:47,750
What does this do? Use to write me- Ah, I see, yeah. Y and RB. RBY. Oh, okay. Because it was

300
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:53,619
just Y in the other game. I'll tell you right now, that is going to fuck me up big time.

301
00:58:54,730 --> 00:59:10,309
But I'll get used to it. Let's go. Take the helmet off. No. The backstabbing? Dude,

302
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:16,500
they brought backstabbing back? Are you serious? That's such a fucking shit thing that they brought

303
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:23,380
back. That's so annoying. I really thought they were going to get rid of that shit. It's so annoying.

304
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:44,179
Makes the game so easy. Not missing anything, right? No. That was a minus two joke. I'm just

305
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:56,789
kidding around. I'm very excited. Let me be excited. That's actually really good. Should I go down?

306
00:59:57,349 --> 01:00:06,420
No, this- Okay, wait. This is where that guy was. The bow and arrow.

307
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:19,659
That uses magic? It does, you're right. How fast is it? Rouch. Rouch to make it harder for enemies

308
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:36,150
to discover you. There's a stealth? Wait, they added stealth. Wow. Okay, that's cool.

309
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:45,289
That's really cool. So I'm imagining if you're in kind of like tall grass like this.

310
01:00:54,139 --> 01:01:19,590
Oops. Well done, wolf. Ramped area ahead. Yep. I wonder what the range is. Yeah, the stance

311
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:30,010
breaking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want me to go ahead and do it? Is there no jump attack? Usually

312
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:37,820
it's what up and- You will never use stealth, I'm sure of it. You can't be that positive about it.

313
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:46,869
It's jump and right trigger. Oh my goodness. Okay, there's a dedicated jump button. That's right.

314
01:01:50,539 --> 01:02:03,190
They actually added a dedicated jump button. Tutorial boss. Soldier of Godric. Let's go.

315
01:02:07,909 --> 01:02:12,710
Hard counters. Yeah, yep, yep. Wait, you can perform a counter attack immediately after blocking

316
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:23,349
an- Wait, what? Was this in the other games? Right trigger immediately after blocking an attack.

317
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:52,389
Block in R1? What does that mean? Is it just a parry? Is it just a parry? It's different? Add in

318
01:02:52,389 --> 01:03:02,679
then- Right. I hear something walking around. Okay, cool. It's after you guard. Right trigger,

319
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:14,039
not right bumper. Okay, cool. It's a held block parry. Does the shield even do it that I have?

320
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:16,519
I feel like this kind of shield would not do that.

321
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:30,920
Parry the platypus. Shield will do it. Okay, I gotta- There's the item I couldn't get.

322
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:39,719
Strength, new. Knee mode? That's it? You didn't do the voice.

323
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:45,210
I actually need to practice this because it'd be embarrassing if I get it wrong.

324
01:03:45,769 --> 01:04:03,159
All right, well, that was cool. Let's go. It's like, oh, parry the platypus. I'm going to take

325
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:07,960
over the entire world, parry. No, it's me doofus. But that was actually really, really good and I

326
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,860
would say that was probably the best one you've heard anybody do. I'm not sure that you could

327
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:16,059
probably find somebody on Twitch right now that could do that better than what I just did.

328
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:25,780
I have to give myself a little bit of credit. Uh, well, I have the bonfire now.

329
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,750
Use tarnish-filled fingers. Yeah, this is co-op. I'm not going to be really doing it.

330
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:53,320
What's this? Use stone sword key. Do I have one? Write that down. Whatever this is. I need a stone

331
01:04:53,320 --> 01:05:14,260
sword key for the bonfire. What's this place called? Here it is. Okay. Why is it so spaced out?

332
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:35,320
All right. Gamer notes. I always forget this stuff and I never remember where it is and I will sit

333
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:40,630
here and I will beg you guys to tell me where the gargoyle statue was and everybody was going to

334
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:57,860
laugh at me and then you're going to send me in a completely different place. What's this?

335
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,980
Lever ahead. Yeah, you're blocking the lever. I can't even do the thing.

336
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:07,860
Can't even. They're blocking it. I can't even activate it. Is that supposed to be happening?

337
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:21,929
What a liar. There's no path here. Elevator. What about back here?

338
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:34,809
Oh, okay. Let's go. Do you like video games or are you a liar?

339
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:41,880
Playing a video game right now that I really like so far. You'll see after I die like five or six

340
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:47,179
times to the first actual boss and I tell you that games aren't really for me anymore and I'm

341
01:06:47,179 --> 01:07:08,170
kind of done. Nothing here. All right. Let's go. Dude, the feeling of... Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wait,

342
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:40,170
wait, wait, wait, wait. Guys. Oh my God. This is unbelievable. No way. Look at the tree in the

343
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:56,539
distance. I can just go anywhere now, right? That's the whole point of this game. Elden Ring,

344
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:05,880
you can just do anything. This actually looks fucking crazy. Didn't expect gorgeous view.

345
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:13,960
Look at that over there. This is insane. This is actually crazy. I'm going to go around the back.

346
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:30,699
What? Oh my God. There's more stuff over there. How do I get there? How do I get over there? I'm

347
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:38,039
going to go that way. This is going to be so bad. I am controlled in From Software games because

348
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:43,289
there's only one direction you can usually run, but this is going to be a disaster.

349
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:47,859
In every corner of the lands between you will find fruits and flowers,

350
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:52,579
mushrooms and butterflies and various other useful materials. There's a crafting

351
01:08:54,260 --> 01:09:11,659
row of fruit. Dude. Wow. Those, oh, those are hostile. These bald eagles. Wait, am I high

352
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:21,319
enough level to fight these two bald eagles? Are they hostile? No, they're not. But do I need them

353
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:34,729
for anything? I think I needed to do that for some reason. Poor toad. What? Oops. Oh my God. I feel

354
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:38,970
so, I feel awful. I didn't want to do that. I was just testing my woof. I didn't want to do that.

355
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:46,260
What about the, they were like friends or they were friends or siblings or lovers or I don't know,

356
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:58,180
one of those things. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to do that. What is that? There's just random

357
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:07,750
animals. What? Okay. This is crazy. I forgot where I was. All right. Let's go over here.

358
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:20,439
There's a crab down there. Do I have the horse yet? Or no, probably not.

359
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:30,739
Okay. So I don't see anything over there. I'm going to wait. There's more materials.

360
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:47,340
Herd leaf flower. Somebody over here. I'm just going to go this way. Wait, there's a person.

361
01:10:49,239 --> 01:11:01,289
Roots. What's that? What's that? Oh shit, there's a person. Okay.

362
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:11,699
Guidance of grace. Grace exists to guide the tarnished and lead them along the proper path.

363
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:16,979
Even now, some sites of grace retain that power. Their golden rays will guide you along your way.

364
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:26,300
This is pointing in the direction that I have to go? That's it?

365
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:34,539
There's just a person pointing in a direction? Use your map to check your current position as

366
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:38,859
well as the terrain and surrounding structures. You can update your map with new information

367
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:44,859
by finding map fragments at Steeles along the road. You can also use the map to freely place

368
01:11:44,859 --> 01:11:52,619
beacons of light to serve as landmarks. Okay. So you're going to find map fragments and you

369
01:11:52,619 --> 01:12:00,979
can place markers. Oh Jesus. With the map menu, you can check your current position and terrain

370
01:12:00,979 --> 01:12:06,970
and buildings in the surrounding area. You can also place beacons of light to serve as a landmark.

371
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:13,220
Lastly, for your map, you can select any site of grace that you've discovered and traveled there

372
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:25,989
instantaneously. Really? Oh my goodness. That's awesome. Cool. And it's pointing this direction.

373
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:32,970
Are you getting this? I think I'm getting this. All right. So what if I place a beacon

374
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:46,739
over there? Does it show up? It does. How many can I place? Okay. You can place like,

375
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:54,579
you can place like step five beacons. I don't remove these. All right. I'm going to have to

376
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:59,539
write down like beacon one. Cheshire Trest. Can't open yet. This is going to be the best game I've

377
01:12:59,539 --> 01:13:08,500
ever made. Okay. Let's go. Hail Vlad. I told you someone was going to do it.

378
01:13:33,979 --> 01:13:37,979
What? Why do you say that?

379
01:13:47,689 --> 01:14:01,659
That guy's scaring me back there.

380
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:08,460
You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction.

381
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:16,939
This is such a good looking game too. That is the guidance of grace. The path punished must

382
01:14:16,939 --> 01:14:27,560
travel. I'm so excited. Relax. Grace's guidance holds the answers. It will lead you to the path

383
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:34,380
you're meant to follow. So, okay. Wherever this thing is pointing is where my like a current

384
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:55,100
objective is. L plus ratio plus maidenless. Such grace. Yep. It's okay. The grace and we

385
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:01,659
got to get grace. All right. Do you do anything else? Is this a vendor or something? Or should

386
01:15:01,659 --> 01:15:04,460
I just just literally go back behind this guy and shove my sword through the back of his neck

387
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:09,350
through his throat? Because I mean, you might watch other streamers that play these games one

388
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:14,409
way, but I kill every NPC. I don't know. A lot of new viewers might not know that. I kill every

389
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:19,130
single NPC and my character stays at like level four. And then I quit the game in like two hours.

390
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:23,210
So if that's what you don't want, then I'm actually just kidding. Don't leave because people

391
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:28,869
probably just like, Oh, fuck this guy. And they left. Don't click the X yet. I am kidding. I beat

392
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:34,659
Sekiro on stream and I was a fun game. Let's go. All right. We're going to go that way. I got to

393
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:43,979
fight this guy. Very obviously the guy on the horse was this. Summoning pools? In each area

394
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:50,060
you may find effigies of martyrs. These effigies are summoning pools. You'll find it easy to summon

395
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:55,539
other players at these locations as co-op and hostile summoning science created. Okay. This is

396
01:15:55,539 --> 01:16:06,180
like the summoning zone. I don't need it. There's only one boss that I ever summoninged. And that

397
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:12,569
was the big dragon from dark souls three that we like Mario partied and beat it. I'm saying that

398
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:16,649
like anybody remembers that when that the channel had like, I think like 1500 concurrent viewers,

399
01:16:16,649 --> 01:16:20,489
like when I played that game, why am I saying, do you guys remember that? Maybe somebody do.

400
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:24,649
All right. Um, I'm, I'm, I'm going to, all right, I'm going to shoot this guy.

401
01:16:25,529 --> 01:16:47,579
Let's go. Didn't miss. I sneak up and backstab pre sentinel. All right, let's go. What the fuck

402
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:54,170
just happened to the game? Why is the game like slowing up and speeding up? What the

403
01:16:54,170 --> 01:17:10,329
fuck is that? 30 and 90. The game like slowed down and then sped up and then slowed down again.

404
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:15,850
All right. On dying, you'll be revived at the last site of grace that you visited.

405
01:17:16,409 --> 01:17:21,029
It was drop any runes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you die again, they're gone. Yeah.

406
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:29,989
Compass will show you where the body is. That's actually really helpful. That was weird. Is that

407
01:17:29,989 --> 01:17:35,500
the kind of bugs that people were talking about? There's like video problems. Oh, hopefully that's

408
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:51,210
not that prevalent because that kind of sucks. You can jump. Whoa, dude, what the fuck? That

409
01:17:51,210 --> 01:18:22,279
actually is like hard to play with. I get it. I didn't hit him. Oh shit. I don't think I can

410
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:41,779
fight this guy right now. I think it's too hard. You know, way too long. Is this hitting him? I

411
01:18:45,859 --> 01:19:01,430
fucking hate the stupid fencing weapon. All right. Breathe. Wait, wait, what was the comment?

412
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:11,979
Lower the graphic settings. Is that sort of actually do something to help that? Yeah. So

413
01:19:11,979 --> 01:19:18,520
like every so often, the game will like slow speed up. Is this something I should turn off?

414
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:36,420
Turn off auto adjust in settings. Whoa. Okay. Advanced settings. Wait, I know it was right

415
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:56,600
there. Auto detect off. Oh, no, no. Auto adjust. Where is it? Is that what you mean? Is a different

416
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:08,819
one? There's bullet time. It's the auto detect. Yeah. It's not in here too, right? Motion blur.

417
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:18,619
No, let's see what that helps. I mean, it only really happens in the first 10 seconds, 20 seconds

418
01:20:18,619 --> 01:20:26,699
of a fight, but that's still kind of horrible. I can kill this guy. Let's go. Although I'm just

419
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:37,029
going to be, I think I'm just going to cast at him. Did I pull him somewhere else? I mean,

420
01:20:37,029 --> 01:21:00,489
the game's too pretty. All right, let's go. Oh, that's bad. That actually is why I got hit.

421
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:31,590
Back it up. Oh, fuck, even one hit. Ah, shit. Oh, that's like, that makes the game even harder.

422
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:37,260
So that's what they wanted to make the game more difficult. I'll turn the graphics down.

423
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:59,880
What do you think is doing it? I wonder. Reflection quality, shadow quality. This is AO. Try that.

424
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:20,069
All right. It's on medium. Oh, but look, it's ugly now. Let's see if that does anything. Fight

425
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:36,619
him up on the higher hills. Don't fight him down here. Whoa. Oh no. Is that coming through? You

426
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:47,829
guys seeing that too? Or is that only coming through on my screen? Like fight him over here?

427
01:22:48,470 --> 01:23:09,449
Let's try it. It feels a little better. Yeah, that feels much better. I waited way too long to swing.

428
01:23:10,329 --> 01:24:00,630
Yeah, that feels a million times better. I'm out of MP. Whoa. Oops. Oops. Come on. Geez, Andy.

429
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:43,319
What's that? What does that mean? Yeah. I'm out of magic ammo. Fuck. Okay. I got to pay attention to

430
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:54,300
that. I got to pay more attention to that. What is left bumper in circle? Okay. I got it.

431
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:24,630
Oh my God. I suck. All right. So I got to fight him up there. All right. I get it. He was doing

432
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:40,760
this weird like shield move. I got it. It's Y and right bumper is to do that. Okay. I got it. I got

433
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:48,359
him on a half. Get more mana flash. I got this. I got this. We don't need to level up. I don't

434
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:53,800
have to do shit. I got this. Get better magic ammo. All right. I got this. I got this. I got this.

435
01:25:53,800 --> 01:26:06,260
I got to fight him up here though. This is awesome. This is really good. I'm really. Oh my God. I

436
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:10,310
can't wait to play this. Is that funny when you feel like that? When you're already playing the

437
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:16,760
game. All right. Yeah. That stuttering is kind of a problem, but I'm willing to look over it.

438
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:36,869
This is okay. I got to go this way. Remember this is called buyer's remorse.

439
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:58,869
What? This is fantastic. Oh, hold on. Get that V sync. I mean when I fought him over here,

440
01:26:58,869 --> 01:27:06,060
it was fine. There's another bonfire there. All right. I'm going to do that bonfire because it's

441
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:13,449
like right. That's really close. Screen mode is put it on exclusive full screen, not borderless

442
01:27:13,449 --> 01:27:27,939
window. I think that'll help. Then I can't easily tab over to my notes. It might help it. See.

443
01:27:31,689 --> 01:27:59,189
That changed. That was, that's weird. What happened here? Oh, oh shit. Okay. See if that helps.

444
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:11,939
I have a 1440p monitor. Yeah. Put it in offline mode. Let's see if that does anything. We're

445
01:28:11,939 --> 01:28:21,340
going to try it until I get it right. See if I can get it. All right. Everyone quiet.

446
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:40,920
I have an idea. I didn't know. Wait, what? He's springing three moves together. What the

447
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,319
fuck are these moves he's doing? He's just bringing this shit together now.

448
01:28:54,220 --> 01:29:10,250
Oh my God, dude. I don't think it happened there though. I think the full screen thing fixed it.

449
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:18,390
This guy's OP. Oh, I didn't touch the thing. All right. All right. My plan is I want to try

450
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:22,390
to bring him down to like half health without using magic and then just dodge around and use

451
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:33,270
the magic and kill him. You parry that? You might. I don't know. I need the horse.

452
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:59,270
All right. That didn't fix it by the way. I probably can come back and kill this guy,

453
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:16,739
but I'm like so obsessed with beating him. You only have 12 gigs of RAM. I have way more than

454
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:26,359
12 gigs of RAM. All right. Fuck. It's still happening. I'm going to go. I'm not going to

455
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:49,590
fight this guy right now. I don't think this way I can fix it. It's just this area. Well,

456
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:53,670
then I'm going to let me play the way that I was playing before then because I want the

457
01:30:53,670 --> 01:31:12,020
borderless window because that didn't fix anything. And then turn the quality back up

458
01:31:12,739 --> 01:31:27,260
and let them turn this up to high. Okay. Let's go. All right. Put it back at 1440. Yeah. I can't

459
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:40,619
even do exclusive. All right. That looks better. All right. I'm just going to, I'll come back to

460
01:31:40,619 --> 01:31:49,500
them later. This is actually a very common bug with an easy fix. Simply close the program and

461
01:31:49,500 --> 01:32:03,689
wait for the devs to finish the game. I thought you had an actual solution. All right. Through

462
01:32:03,689 --> 01:32:08,810
your map, you can instantly travel to any sites of grace that you've discovered. Yep. Very cool.

463
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:24,470
Go offline. I do that from the menu. Play offline. I think I have to restart the game.

464
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:29,430
I don't think that's the problem though. I think it just is like a current bug in the PC version.

465
01:32:30,699 --> 01:32:34,539
Strengthening. At a smithing table, you can spend runes and smithing stones to strengthen your

466
01:32:34,539 --> 01:32:39,880
armaments. Somewhere in the lands between you may meet a black with who. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

467
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:55,640
Everything's stone. That's just like the titanite shards with the app. Yep. I don't want to upgrade

468
01:32:55,640 --> 01:33:07,909
this dumb ass weapon. Tarnished. I can see it, but I can also see that you're not after my throat.

469
01:33:08,949 --> 01:33:18,600
Then why not purchase a little something? This vendor. Cool. Okay. Ooh, what do you got?

470
01:33:19,399 --> 01:33:32,949
Throwing dagger, telescope, finger remedy, crackpot, crafting kit. I don't have any souls.

471
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:53,779
They're all gone. Cookbook. Oh man, this is cool. Okay. Cool. You only have four bitcoins.

472
01:33:54,500 --> 01:34:09,800
That's not what that is. I gotta get my souls back. I don't want to fight this guy. I just want to

473
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:21,590
pick up the souls that are on the ground over there. No, get away from me. I don't fucking

474
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:30,090
have any. All right. I'm just gonna go. I'm gonna go towards the great rainbow thing and just play.

475
01:34:30,890 --> 01:35:00,470
Ah, wait, what's over here? I'm going to explore a little. I'm tired of your behavior. I didn't do

476
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:20,869
anything. And what is it? Nope. No door ahead. Okay. Do I discover anything? Will I get removed

477
01:35:20,869 --> 01:35:46,149
like the fog of war on the map if I discover stuff? Oh Jesus. Those, there's penguins. What?

478
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:56,859
Why is it every animal on earth here? Is this such a regular enemy or is this a boss or something?

479
01:35:57,779 --> 01:36:39,050
Um, uh, oh man, I'm not supposed to be down here. Oh, he's so slow.

480
01:36:40,649 --> 01:36:57,239
He's got a big sword on his back. I thought he was going to go faster.

481
01:37:01,319 --> 01:37:15,380
You know, it's all right. It's okay. It's okay. Holy shit. Oh my God.

482
01:37:18,649 --> 01:37:28,819
No, we're just like the little shitty skeleton enemies. It's just big scary people. I, all right.

483
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:46,260
You're dying to trash mobs. This is crazy that this is just everywhere. All right. Where I got

484
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:55,579
to find like a bunch of shitties. I'm going to follow the grace of whatever this is. I feel

485
01:37:55,579 --> 01:37:59,579
like I'm missing a couple of important items. Maybe I need the horse. I don't have the horse yet.

486
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:10,489
It's all so much to take in. This is, this is insane. I'm not, I'm going to be playing

487
01:38:10,489 --> 01:38:17,079
this for a long time. He hasn't killed a single enemy since the tutorial. Well, I've only seen

488
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:23,239
two enemies. Huge guy with huge sword and huge guy on huge horse. I haven't fought a guy with

489
01:38:23,239 --> 01:38:27,319
a torch in his hand. This is the first guy that's just a regular dude with a torch in his hand.

490
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:38,869
I'm going to kill him. He's not going to do any points of damage. I've only fought huge guys.

491
01:38:39,670 --> 01:39:09,449
Ooh. Nice. Lucrease. The stealth is actually a really cool mechanic.

492
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:24,439
There's a patch out to help with optimization issues. I think that probably,

493
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:48,859
that's the day one patch, right? I think that already came out. All right. I'm going to,

494
01:39:48,859 --> 01:39:51,739
there's a little bit of stuff to explore over here. I'm going to keep acquiring materials.

495
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:58,819
What's the backstory for your character? Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'll play that song. Oh, yes,

496
01:39:58,819 --> 01:40:17,590
we'll play that. Rune fragment. I wonder what these, um, oh, I was going to say, what are these

497
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:31,079
little skulls? Rune fragments, Rune fragments. Cool. It's up here. Okay. I'm going. All right.

498
01:40:31,079 --> 01:40:36,569
I think this is the, this is the destination right here. I'm going to put a marker here

499
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:45,829
because that's where I'm trying to go that way. I was making that sound. You hear that?

500
01:40:47,189 --> 01:41:03,720
What the hell is that? Tear drop scarabs. There are both crimson and cerulean teardrop scarabs.

501
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:07,239
Feed them to replenish the flasks that match their type.

502
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:19,000
Something else I'm noticing too is what's going on with the stamina bar here.

503
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:28,779
I, I don't, I'm not using stamina. That's interesting. It just refills your estus. Okay.

504
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:38,090
It only happens in combat. Okay. This is where I need to go. But all right, let's just see what

505
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:47,180
happens. That is so pretty refills. So I don't have to go to like a bonfire. That's kind of cool.

506
01:41:53,340 --> 01:42:12,390
Eight front ruins. Oh, all right. Wait. All right. The dog didn't, I didn't hit the dog.

507
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:23,460
I'm playing this on hard mode for myself because I sincerely hate the, uh, the fencing weapons.

508
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:44,180
It's a challenge. I'm for it. Oh, they're fast. Get a new weapon. I will in beast bones.

509
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,800
The crafting seems pretty cool too. I'm really interested in how that plays out. I'm gonna

510
01:42:51,800 --> 01:43:03,659
stealth. What the fuck am I doing? I'm not a fan of this game. You know why? Cause like I can't

511
01:43:03,659 --> 01:43:10,220
go over there and hold my binoculars up and just scan and just have like seven or eight squares

512
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:32,250
show up. Like I know exactly where they are. Oh, what's with that? Come on. Oops. You can't block.

513
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:50,260
You can't block magic. Can you? Oh, you can't. I'm going to forget to stealth a lot of these

514
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:54,039
times too. Oh boy. Look at that guy. I think I can kill that guy in one hit.

515
01:43:54,680 --> 01:44:04,010
Did he go over there? What? No way. How did you, how did you even see what I was doing?

516
01:44:04,729 --> 01:44:44,300
I went right by his ass. Come on. Watch out. A guy coming down. Come on. That's an alarm system.

517
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:53,319
That's an alarm system. That's an alarm system. Uh oh. Uh oh. Oh no. Okay. That's not, that's really

518
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:59,020
bad. That's really bad. That's the entire camp. Um, I don't think I can get, I don't think I can

519
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:06,020
get out of this. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

520
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:13,130
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. They got something back here. I'm going to like open the

521
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:20,220
chest and leave. You guys have to have some bullshit over here, right? What is this map?

522
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:38,779
This is a stupid idea. I'm just going to leave. What is that? That's my marker. Just like taking

523
01:45:38,779 --> 01:45:49,109
all their food. Wait, I think I despawned everybody. Remind me, can you parry people

524
01:45:49,670 --> 01:46:09,800
with a spear? I forget. Dark souls. I think you can. I've got no magic left in this thing.

525
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:35,060
Open up. Open up. Fine. I'll just kill you. That's fine. I'm going to just, I'm going to thin

526
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:37,539
them out. I'm going to take out the whole camp so I can just walk around and collect whatever I want.

527
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:45,850
Still no giant. Oh, that's where it wants me to go. I'm not done with this place yet though.

528
01:46:46,489 --> 01:46:50,170
We're going to go through and we're going to stealth kill like all these people. Watch this.

529
01:46:50,970 --> 01:47:21,159
Everybody else here, right? He hates jumping. It's such a new concept to me in these games.

530
01:47:21,159 --> 01:47:28,439
I have to get used to it for a while. The fact that jump, like just regular jump exists,

531
01:47:28,439 --> 01:47:38,920
it's, that's going to take a minute to hear how jumping, but secure played like a completely

532
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:43,319
different game than this. To me, this feels more like dark souls than secure. So to me,

533
01:47:43,319 --> 01:48:01,859
it's like kind of a dark souls game in my brain. Can I open this video games are video games. Yes,

534
01:48:01,859 --> 01:48:11,479
that's precisely what I'm saying. Butterflies and then say something about these smoldering

535
01:48:11,479 --> 01:48:26,739
butterfly. I won't. Oh shit. Okay. Well, hold on. I think I'm going to come back here because I

536
01:48:26,739 --> 01:48:36,550
have 1200, um, souls. I guess saying jump, jump, jump. Fine. That actually is very useful. Wait,

537
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:47,960
does jump have invincibility frames? That's a huge fucking deal. If it does, it doesn't. Okay. I just

538
01:48:47,960 --> 01:49:05,380
needed to find out. I needed to know. Wait, I can go up there at the chest. Get the chest up.

539
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:15,750
Um, hold on. Oh wait, this is a chat. I thought there's just a wagon. This just looks like a

540
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:30,069
wagon. It looks like the back, like a bumper. Oh, oh my. What 18 decks. Oh, I'm going to be a flail

541
01:49:30,069 --> 01:49:37,210
guy. I can't wait. It flails. There's never been an item like that. Holy shit. I'm so excited. This

542
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:49,340
is awesome. Okay. So I got a flail and there's a guy on a horse over there. Take off the helmet.

543
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:55,750
I will eventually. I need to explore. Guys, this is not going to be like a, like a four hour and

544
01:49:55,750 --> 01:50:08,020
25 minute stream. Don't worry. I'm here all night. I'm not stopping for a long time. There's a chest.

545
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:24,979
I don't think you can open these. Did I miss anything else? I can go down there, but I feel

546
01:50:24,979 --> 01:50:32,789
like that's kind of scary. So let's just go ahead and do it. I'm not reading any more notes because

547
01:50:32,789 --> 01:50:53,180
they're spoilers. This is too perfect. Is it too perfect? With a whetstone knife, you can use

548
01:50:53,180 --> 01:51:03,270
ashes of war to grant your armaments new skills. An armor can only have one skill. Any skill it had

549
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:16,199
will be removed permanently. Adding affinities. With a whetstone knife, you can use ash of war

550
01:51:16,199 --> 01:51:21,880
to grant affinities to your armaments. Okay. I know it's like lore definitions, but armaments

551
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:29,560
just means weapons, right? That's not some other thing. This way you can alter like weapons attack

552
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:39,770
affinity. Okay. With attribute scaling and more ash of war storm stomp and a whetstone knife.

553
01:51:40,649 --> 01:51:44,649
Jesus Christ, man. Go offline already. Like what the fuck? I'm not, I don't want to play online

554
01:51:44,649 --> 01:52:03,979
anymore. I've always hated that. Okay. I think I've done everything here. A new map has been found.

555
01:52:03,979 --> 01:52:20,020
Lynn grave west. It looks like sorcery. Oh, there's another wagon here too. What was it?

556
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:50,279
Not that one. There's another one somewhere. Where? Hey. Oh, there's two guys here. Really?

557
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:13,989
Yeah. Vanquishing an enemy group will replenish your flasks. The number and type of flasks

558
01:53:13,989 --> 01:53:22,409
replenish varies. Enemy group? Wait, does that, so that means I cleared this camp?

559
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:38,310
Oh, that's kind of cool. All right. Just got to open up the back of this wagon over here.

560
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:59,479
What do we got here? Lord sworn's great sword. I definitely can't use that. Is this snow in this

561
01:53:59,479 --> 01:54:22,939
game? If it is, it gets like a full letter grid and probably does have snow. I know I want to go

562
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:36,359
in there, but not yet. Okay. Maybe I will go fight that boss. I need to use a weapon. I want to use

563
01:54:36,359 --> 01:54:59,750
first. I wonder where the level up person is. I could sit here and do a new weapon art. Oh,

564
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:22,890
hold on. The 18 to put the flail on. So please remind me of that. Greetings. Traveler from

565
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:56,600
beyond the fog. I am Melana. I offer you an accord. Have you heard of the finger maidens?

566
01:55:58,859 --> 01:56:06,390
They serve the two fingers. Night time. Offering guidance and aid to the tarnished.

567
01:56:09,239 --> 01:56:15,609
But you, I am afraid, are maidenless. Can you stop saying that? Like stop. We have to keep

568
01:56:15,609 --> 01:56:24,149
reminding me. I can play the role of maiden. That guy's kind of rude. Turning rooms into strength

569
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:35,350
to aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. You need only take me with you to the foot of the

570
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:42,359
tree. All right. So we're going to go to the tree. Does this matter? I mean, I kind of,

571
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:47,720
I want to be able to level up in the game. Okay. I'm not going to do like a hard mode run

572
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:59,220
to turn rooms into strength. Another matter. I bequeath to you this ring.

573
01:56:59,859 --> 01:57:06,199
It's the ring. The spectral speed. Okay. Now I have the horse. I can. Okay. I was trying to

574
01:57:06,199 --> 01:57:12,579
fight the horse boss over and over again with no horse. That was probably pretty stupid.

575
01:57:13,619 --> 01:57:26,329
All right. Use it to traverse great distances. It torrent has chosen you. Treat him with respect.

576
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:35,529
Level up. Shall I turn your rooms to strength? Let my hand rest upon you.

577
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:44,789
The samurai is ruining my cut scene. Get out of here.

578
01:57:49,319 --> 01:58:01,270
Okay. This is important. All right. Vigour is health and fire resistance and immunity.

579
01:58:01,989 --> 01:58:10,310
So that's important, obviously. The mind determines FP. FP is mana and also affects focus. What is

580
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:18,600
focus? Your resistance to sleep and bouts of madness. The higher the number, the lower your

581
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:28,100
susceptibility. Okay. Endurance is stamina like every single other game. And equipment load.

582
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:34,100
Robustness. What's that? Blood loss and frostbite. Ooh, there's your snow area, by the way.

583
01:58:34,819 --> 01:58:46,489
Strength. Yep. Dex. Yep. We all know what that does. But hold on. Arcane. Attribute governing

584
01:58:46,489 --> 01:59:01,479
discovery. Holy defense, vitality, certain sorceries. Arcane is luck. Okay. Well, I mean,

585
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:18,630
it's 18 to have the flail. So I'm going that. I'm doing intelligence and dex. It's expensive.

586
01:59:21,989 --> 01:59:28,300
Dex. I'm going even into dex and intelligence. And it's probably going to make me impossible

587
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:32,859
and softlock me from completing the game. But I don't think so. I think it'll be okay.

588
01:59:41,189 --> 01:59:50,619
18 for the flail. Yeah. I'll go for 15 first. Or 18 first. Add charge to flask. Use... Whoa.

589
01:59:51,579 --> 02:00:03,590
What? Use one golden... Do I already have one? Hold on. This is different. All right. I want two

590
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:23,529
and two. I already have one? Oh, right. Okay. Oh, ashes of war. Grant skills and affinities.

591
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:38,420
All right. Didn't I just get one? Storm stomp. Strength scaling. Do I consume this stuff?

592
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:42,979
Is this a bad... If I put this in, is it like gems in Diablo 2? Am I never going to get this back?

593
02:00:43,619 --> 02:00:55,670
I don't know. I'm kind of scared to do it. No. Okay. Quality or standard? I mean, it's going

594
02:00:55,670 --> 02:01:00,390
to be quality, right? Because... I mean, it's got to be standard because of the dex scaling.

595
02:01:01,109 --> 02:01:11,930
Oh, wait. Let me see what that does. Use the spectral steed whistle to summon and ride your

596
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:19,529
spectral steed. If your steed dies, you can summon it again, but it will cost one flask. Oh, shit.

597
02:01:19,529 --> 02:01:34,979
Really? That's... Oh, no. Pouches. Oh, it's just items. Yeah. How do I call the whistle?

598
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:55,689
What do I do? Left? Where's my steed? Emery. Okay. So, I just have to do this.

599
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:12,520
Oh, it's a jump. Yeah. No, shit. I fight the horse guy with a horse. Okay. I need two.

600
02:02:13,319 --> 02:02:19,539
It wants me to go this way. I'm going to go... I'm going to fuck that guy up.

601
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,760
But first, I'm going to get a couple more points. Can I stealth with the horse?

602
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:37,420
Is it double jump? What? How fun is it to be on the horse and stab people? That's not the

603
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:59,829
button you do to do that. I don't know. I hit X. Cool. All right. Really cool. How much did I

604
02:02:59,829 --> 02:03:26,779
need? 800? Can I not cast spells from the horse? Whoa. One, two, three. Cool. 800. I think it was 850.

605
02:03:32,729 --> 02:03:38,250
Golden rune. I like that you can pick stuff up on the horse. That would be awful if you couldn't.

606
02:03:43,180 --> 02:04:02,470
Okay. There's a sprint. Damn. Okay. Cool. Let me get this queued up. That should be enough to put

607
02:04:02,470 --> 02:04:08,229
one more point in, and then I'm going to go try to kill the horse guy. The staff in your right hand.

608
02:04:08,229 --> 02:04:38,920
Really? Can I actually cast from horseback? You can. Can you drink flasks from horseback? You can?

609
02:04:42,520 --> 02:05:03,640
Okay. Awesome. Get to 16. So I'm imagining that she just is at every place. Okay. Yeah.

610
02:05:04,439 --> 02:05:20,250
Let's go. All right. The horse guy was back this way. I got to start remembering where the hell

611
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:27,739
this stuff is. Horse guy was down here. I'm just going to follow the road. See if I can kill him.

612
02:05:28,539 --> 02:05:32,779
Wait. I got to go to that one. Wait. Can I fast travel? Yeah.

613
02:05:45,239 --> 02:05:50,760
Can't rest right now. Who are you talking to?

614
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:58,739
Pleasure to meet thee, tarnished. I am the witch, Rena. I'd heard tale of a tarnished

615
02:05:58,739 --> 02:06:03,539
hurtling about atop a spectral steed. Wow. This planet. Upon looking into the matter,

616
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:10,920
the talk I surmise is of thee. Any spells? Thou art possessed of the power, no? Call forth

617
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:19,770
the spectral steed named Torrent. I can call the spectral steed. As I had hoped,

618
02:06:20,409 --> 02:06:24,569
I was entrusted this for thee by Torrent's former master.

619
02:06:25,449 --> 02:06:34,409
Wow. Spirit calling bell? Lone wolf ashes. Tis a bell calling forth spirits. Summon them with it

620
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:40,949
from ash and return to the urtree. The spirits will obey thine command but briefly.

621
02:06:41,989 --> 02:06:47,670
As they recall battles past. This is another one of those kind of weapon art things. As thou

622
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:55,909
wishest. Summoning spirits. With a spirit casting bell, you can use ashes to summon various spirits.

623
02:06:55,909 --> 02:07:00,789
Summoning typically consumes FP, right? You can only have one spirit at a time. You cannot

624
02:07:00,789 --> 02:07:09,050
summon spirits during multiplayer. We got more stuff to look at here. I have to equip it?

625
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:22,039
Okay. So I have this like horse, I have this wolf move? Forgive mine intrusion, tarnished.

626
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:30,180
I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the lands between. So did they

627
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:37,779
remove? Before the tarnished tire of obeisance to the two fingers. So back in the other

628
02:07:37,779 --> 02:07:43,460
From Software games you had consumables like grenades and throwing knives and stones to throw

629
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:54,970
and coins and is this the replacement or is that stuff in the game too? He's gone. Those are still

630
02:07:54,970 --> 02:08:00,810
all here. I have to really condense what's going to be on this bar down here because I really

631
02:08:00,810 --> 02:08:16,489
foresee a problem where I'm just like okay that's what I want. I have to actually equip the bell.

632
02:08:16,970 --> 02:08:45,670
Is it a where is it? Is it where is it? The second tab on the menu. Oh equip that bell icon.

633
02:08:50,039 --> 02:08:59,829
It's on my oh it's like wait I can't do it. The bell stop saying that.

634
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:13,000
Equip the gauntlets. Oh yeah I got to do stuff didn't I? It's not gonna be too heavy right?

635
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:25,270
27 and 49 still rolling fine. Okay well I'm just going for it. There he is.

636
02:09:26,149 --> 02:09:44,380
Yeah no I haven't equipped already. We talking. All right dude it's time. Let's go. Holy shit

637
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:55,829
what's happening? I can queue them up like that? What? Holy shit that's so that's overpowered.

638
02:09:55,829 --> 02:10:11,210
That's absolutely broken. What? Okay hold on. That just freaked me out so much. You can just

639
02:10:11,210 --> 02:10:17,270
spam it? All right all right all right I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's

640
02:10:17,270 --> 02:10:27,850
go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm ready. You just got hard countered. Yeah I'm the dickhead that's playing

641
02:10:27,850 --> 02:10:35,750
against the fucking Lucario. Just sitting there spam spam spam spam spam spam and finally he catches

642
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:45,850
me and he KOs me. All right it's gonna be hard to not spam though because I'm fucking stupid.

643
02:10:45,850 --> 02:11:11,140
All right let's go. Patience I'll kill him right now. No this weapon actually probably isn't that

644
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:18,699
great for when I'm oh man that's slow down. Um please fire at him like what the fuck I couldn't

645
02:11:18,699 --> 02:11:29,079
I couldn't shoot him. That was actually kind of unbearable. I couldn't do anything. I tried to

646
02:11:29,079 --> 02:11:49,739
like press right bumper and the game like hung. Maybe I shouldn't go around that fast. We should

647
02:11:49,739 --> 02:12:09,930
fight him like this. It's his frame rate aura. Turn the grass down. All right grass the grass is

648
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:21,500
on medium. I have to go to the main menu for that shit. Oh god damn it whatever. So is there eye

649
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:32,390
frames with the horse dash or anything? I'm trying to understand like how this kind of work. Is there

650
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:39,699
eye frames with the horse? No it's not okay. I was just testing just testing. I want to see if the eye

651
02:12:39,699 --> 02:12:55,989
like that little dash that he does his eye frames. All the jumps have eye frames? Lowering the grass

652
02:12:55,989 --> 02:12:59,109
can improve it by about five percent. I feel like five percent's really not that much.

653
02:13:00,069 --> 02:13:15,750
It would need to be like 80 percent for me to notice it I think. What do the wolves do? Let me

654
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:35,220
try it. What? He's just running over trees. Do they fight? They're actually kind of good.

655
02:13:36,100 --> 02:14:14,470
All right let's go. Holy damn it. Oh what? Not good. It's empty. That took almost my whole

656
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:28,310
fp bar. Holy shit okay. Whoops I thought I had the other weapon.

657
02:14:43,529 --> 02:14:54,199
Shit hit the horse. Oh my god this guy. Fucking oh my goodness. This is such a new concept.

658
02:14:54,760 --> 02:15:09,029
This little sword. Yeah I need I need like a huge lance. Okay so that takes up the whole fp bar.

659
02:15:15,779 --> 02:15:20,300
Did I unlock the flail yet? No not yet. I might be able to two-hand it though.

660
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:23,340
I feel like the horse is making it like a hundred times harder.

661
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:32,890
Did I just fight him? I don't know what to do. It's probably like a rhyme or reason to how to

662
02:15:32,890 --> 02:15:40,939
actually fight on the horse and I'm just kind of running around just like freaking out. I can get

663
02:15:40,939 --> 02:15:49,819
off the horse too right? Yeah you might be under leveled. Oh I mean this guy's kind of just like

664
02:15:49,819 --> 02:16:09,159
an optional encounter it seems. Let's try it. Let's see if I can get him hit. Okay that goes so far.

665
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:17,000
What happened? What happened to the horse? Where's my horse?

666
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:39,780
What the fuck's happening? Did he kill the horse? Um okay let's just see if I can do it like this.

667
02:16:40,420 --> 02:17:08,819
Unfortunately I have can I put this in the other hand? Shit god damn it. Oh my god.

668
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:14,459
I don't think I'm supposed to be fighting this guy right now but he's definitely doable.

669
02:17:25,209 --> 02:17:31,450
You better without the horse. Yeah way better. I'll come back later.

670
02:17:34,459 --> 02:17:45,670
He's definitely doable. Yeah he is. Wolves and magic?

671
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:57,850
I used the whole bar. All right I'm going I'm going I'm going one more try. One more try.

672
02:17:58,790 --> 02:18:04,170
I need to actually equip the shit on the right bar. It's like it's different on the horse

673
02:18:04,969 --> 02:18:12,899
like that okay. All right I'm gonna let's see if I can do it. I'll try it one more time. Last try.

674
02:18:13,459 --> 02:18:19,780
Should I try parrying him? I mean he can kill you in one hit so I feel like I just would rather

675
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:46,729
fight him. Okay here we go. I thought he was gonna swing wrong button. Oh shit look at this.

676
02:18:46,729 --> 02:19:05,690
They can tank. Yeah I'll come back later. This is way too hard. I can die in one hit.

677
02:19:06,620 --> 02:19:25,239
He kills you in one swing. Remember the quitter? Fine. Fuck that. Last try. Last try and I'm

678
02:19:26,340 --> 02:19:31,860
and I'm gonna. All right here we go. You have to get good. I'm I'm gonna get good right now.

679
02:19:32,579 --> 02:21:50,889
How am I frozen? Hold that. I oh what the fuck. I'm still alive. Ah god damn that fucking move.

680
02:22:07,159 --> 02:22:17,100
All right that shield move is almost a 100% one hit kill. He queues it up. He dashes really far

681
02:22:17,819 --> 02:22:26,969
and I'm telling you right now forget about magic here. Absolutely. Wait I'm doing wolves twice

682
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:42,870
and melee. No magic. Come on. Come on. Come on. I got it. I got it. Let's do it. Oh yeah wolves

683
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:48,920
twice. It's a big distraction. He's gonna do this for two hours. I'm probably gonna do this for a

684
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:55,559
lot longer than that. The thing that's the big killer is the um when he queues up the shield

685
02:22:55,559 --> 02:23:00,280
and he goes wham and dashes forward. You gotta wait for it. It's hard to be patient for it.

686
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:21,020
Let's go. Just just co-op him. He can't hit us. He really can't. I don't think he can hit us.

687
02:23:21,020 --> 02:24:20,229
You know what I mean? Oh fuck off. He bumped me. Hey. Ah. All right. Is there another horror? Nope.

688
02:24:24,170 --> 02:24:30,170
Oh what was that fucking move? What the fuck was that? He like just slipped his hand down

689
02:24:30,170 --> 02:24:34,329
and scraped the ground. Come on. I don't think I've even seen him do that yet.

690
02:24:37,510 --> 02:24:55,260
I'll get him. I'll definitely get him. That's the strat. Dogs twice. He's got all these little

691
02:24:55,260 --> 02:25:04,200
nuanced moves. All right let's go. I can cast one spell at him. That'll change. Here we go.

692
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:21,750
Is there a timer on these things? I don't think there is. I got lost in the goddamn push.

693
02:25:22,469 --> 02:25:38,170
I gotta turn the music down too. It's like I'm like a fucking rave right now. I can't concentrate.

694
02:25:39,049 --> 02:25:53,190
It's so hard sometimes when he just leans over it's hard to tell if he's gonna swing or not.

695
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:55,559
What? Did I only do that once? Shit. Foolish. Oh man. Stop using the silly blade.

696
02:26:56,360 --> 02:27:07,620
I can't equip the other dex item yet. No spells wolves only. Yeah I know it's just so easy to

697
02:27:07,620 --> 02:27:14,540
stand back. All right. I definitely can do it. I got him down to like 30 or 40 percent. I'm

698
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:19,590
certain I can do it. Yeah you know I have to get rid of this stupid silly ass blade.

699
02:27:19,590 --> 02:27:25,430
Like it's I hate this fucking thing. This is the worst item in every fucking sperm software game.

700
02:27:26,069 --> 02:27:30,629
It's the worst. It's so stupid it sucks. It has one point where you can hurt somebody.

701
02:27:30,629 --> 02:27:44,379
I'm deleting it. I gotta find a new weapon. I have to beat this guy on principle only.

702
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:48,700
And stop screaming. What is this? Am I making a YouTube video? I mean I probably will.

703
02:27:49,579 --> 02:28:03,290
Let's go. That stupid bump is the worst move. It's so hard. I'm fucking. I'm balding.

704
02:28:04,409 --> 02:28:09,129
That little tiny little bump that he does with the horse. There's almost no telegraphing.

705
02:28:09,770 --> 02:28:33,079
He just goes like bump. All right if I don't do it this time I'm leaving and I'm gonna go

706
02:28:33,079 --> 02:28:37,799
find a new weapon that's not the worst weapon in every from software game. Okay good. Sounds

707
02:28:37,799 --> 02:29:04,700
like a plan. Oh my god. Fuck you. What? No. I'm getting out of here. I'm fine. I'm doing

708
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:10,219
something else to do. I'm not gonna fight the guy that's like the optional fucking boss that

709
02:29:10,219 --> 02:29:24,309
requires like 500 more decks than I have. I'm leaving. Fuck it. I don't even care. I'm going

710
02:29:24,309 --> 02:29:48,299
back home. Good luck wolves. Fight him. Is he still aggro? He's outside. Does he come inside?

711
02:29:48,299 --> 02:30:14,139
Wait. Oh my god. This is scary. He just sits out here. Oh my god. He's gonna knock the whole

712
02:30:14,139 --> 02:30:20,090
building down. Holy shit. What happens if he knocks the building down? Can he kill this guy? Oh no.

713
02:30:20,090 --> 02:30:27,379
I don't want him to kill the NPC. That would be horrible. Don't hurt the NPC please. I don't want

714
02:30:27,379 --> 02:30:52,920
to restart the whole playthrough. Fuck this guy. I'm gonna move on. I'm gonna get the flail and

715
02:30:52,920 --> 02:31:00,360
I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna get the flail. I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna kick his ass

716
02:31:02,219 --> 02:31:34,569
after one more attempt. It worked. It didn't work. I don't think you can parry. That was actually

717
02:31:34,569 --> 02:31:46,420
perfect. That was a perfectly timed parry and it didn't do anything. Okay. Well I can't beat that

718
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:51,459
guy. I'm not supposed to fight that guy. That guy is like... I come back like four hours from now

719
02:31:51,459 --> 02:32:02,600
and fight that guy. Oh fuck it. I'm leaving. If it helps I've been playing for 13 hours and I didn't

720
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:15,770
even know that was a boss. Finally. Finally. But I had to like try to prove my like gamer skills,

721
02:32:15,770 --> 02:32:22,489
right? Fight the optional guy that is hard and now everyone's gonna tell me about all the other

722
02:32:22,489 --> 02:32:28,729
streamers that beat it and I didn't do it and now I have to come back and cheese him with like what

723
02:32:28,809 --> 02:32:37,579
is the equivalent of Dark Souls 1 lightning. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. I'm gonna come back at level 100

724
02:32:37,579 --> 02:33:01,340
and kill him in two hits. Okay. Let me explore. What's over here? Your build is not good for

725
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:07,799
killing him immediately. Yeah I know. I'm just messing around. I'm just kidding. It really would

726
02:33:07,799 --> 02:33:13,079
have been really cool if I used this piece of fucking trash. Right. Never mind. Don't get angry.

727
02:33:14,629 --> 02:33:33,110
Get even. I wonder what these fragments do. You're boiling over with rage. Oh no I am not.

728
02:33:33,989 --> 02:33:39,479
I'm actually really happy that I can't beat that guy. It's just more content.

729
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:42,709
You know what I mean? Like I could stream this game for like the next three months.

730
02:33:47,479 --> 02:34:16,219
Urba. Oh what's this? Mushrooms? This is a little cave over there. Mushrooms. Oh it's in here.

731
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:36,700
Oh shit. Where am I? Do we have face cam now? Yeah. You've earned it. Like 20 minutes.

732
02:34:40,950 --> 02:34:49,610
Okay so I need I need to put the flasks back. I turned on face cam and like my brain just

733
02:34:49,610 --> 02:35:08,579
started to blink. All right what's down here? Proper death means returning to the urd tree.

734
02:35:09,139 --> 02:35:23,079
Have patience until the time comes and the roots call to you. Okay so I have to go to the tree

735
02:35:23,879 --> 02:35:53,930
eventually. It's like a little dungeon. This is cool. Okay. That guy's behind me. Hey what the

736
02:35:53,930 --> 02:36:19,620
fuck are you throwing? Wait a minute. Why do I feel like I okay I have a ton of stamina. A ton of

737
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:31,030
stamina. That's kind of weird. How many times can I swing and dodge and stuff? I'm just noticing

738
02:36:31,030 --> 02:36:39,479
right now that that was only half the stamina bar. Root resin. You know what I'm saying? Like that was

739
02:36:40,459 --> 02:37:10,649
you have more stamina in this game like per swing. Vinny killed him with your sword. Brave

740
02:37:11,370 --> 02:37:23,829
glove wart. Fucking Harry Potter teacher name. Oh co-op. The summoning pool is now functional.

741
02:37:23,829 --> 02:37:34,379
Why do I feel like there's a boss in here? No no no. I ain't fucking around. I'm casting spells

742
02:37:34,379 --> 02:37:58,040
at this guy up there. Where the? I like that you can actually do that but it's going to cause me

743
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:13,459
a lot of problems. Why am I throwing up? What's over here? Brave violet? Secret passage. They're

744
02:38:13,459 --> 02:38:43,059
probably not even in the game. Water? Is that rushing water? Oh dear. Hey that's not fair.

745
02:38:57,940 --> 02:39:09,100
One two three four. It's gonna be close. Dude why are you crouching? What the fuck?

746
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:32,780
Is something behind there? Oh shit there is. Good. All right what is it? Paddling plate hello.

747
02:39:39,350 --> 02:40:17,350
Oh is that the hello? Oh my god go. Where's the very edge? One two three go. Don't go yet.

748
02:40:27,059 --> 02:40:29,459
One of those guys is gonna jump from the ceiling and try to kill me.

749
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:34,180
Where is he? Where is he? Is he gonna? I knew you. I saw you. I knew you were sitting there

750
02:40:34,180 --> 02:40:40,860
waiting for you piece of shit. I knew you were gonna kill me. That guy was pretending to be

751
02:40:40,860 --> 02:40:52,520
one of the pots. Oh my fucking what the heck is going on here? What the heck's happening here guys?

752
02:40:53,079 --> 02:40:58,440
What the heck's happening here? What the heck's happening here? What the fuck is happening?

753
02:40:59,479 --> 02:41:24,229
God damn it. I mean I gotta go down here. I can't just not go down here. You dodged into it. Yeah

754
02:41:24,229 --> 02:41:32,040
it's called panicking because it's scary. What even is this? Blocked by some contraption.

755
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:39,459
Probably you probably open it and leave. All right uh I can I don't need to I'm not gonna waste

756
02:41:39,459 --> 02:41:50,520
magic. Actually this is the perfect time to use the magic. Although I feel like it's a waste.

757
02:41:51,239 --> 02:41:55,819
It is. I can fight these guys without it. Unless they don't fall down. Does he jump?

758
02:41:56,540 --> 02:42:09,700
I don't think he does. Back to that fire room. There's gotta be something at the end of this.

759
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:17,579
Something good right? Oh my freaking god what the heck? Oh what the heck's going on here?

760
02:42:18,299 --> 02:42:26,250
All right this guy up there. There he is. They're doing the stupid thing that is in every horror

761
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:32,010
movie. They're in the corner of the bedroom and they they their head cracks and they look at you.

762
02:42:32,809 --> 02:43:08,040
All right here we go. Holy shit I did I timed it right. Okay here they all come. Just I I have to

763
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:13,239
do this right. Oh my god how did I not see all these guys on the wall? How did I how did I not

764
02:43:13,239 --> 02:43:31,420
see those guys? They actually fooled me. I was completely fooled. Ready? Ah I'm scared!

765
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:41,299
Okay they can they climb? Oh shit he can climb. How do I knock him down?

766
02:43:42,979 --> 02:43:53,659
How do I do the thing that they do in PvP? Fuck no! I like forgot that you could like kick down.

767
02:43:53,659 --> 02:43:57,979
I didn't know if you could climb or not. God damn it I'm like purple. What happened?

768
02:43:58,700 --> 02:44:29,260
Oh I'm purple. Why am I purple? They're gonna die by the fire. It doesn't matter.

769
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:50,219
All right let's get out of here. Give me my lost souls. Get up. I would turn to the camera and all

770
02:44:50,219 --> 02:45:13,659
my facial hair and my eyebrows would be gone. I ain't moving until I'm certain what's going on

771
02:45:13,659 --> 02:45:38,680
here. I'm not moving an inch. Yep all right bud. First off down then lever. First off down then

772
02:45:38,680 --> 02:46:02,940
lever. Oh that's kind of cool. Not yet. Are you kidding me? Stop throwing those! Is he still alive?

773
02:46:05,420 --> 02:46:29,659
They're not gonna fool me now. Somebody right above me. Is somebody actually in this room?

774
02:46:29,659 --> 02:46:39,850
They're all gonna climb out of these little divots. Wandering noble ashes. Oh that's a new move.

775
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:52,250
Destruction. Okay that's pretty cool. I got what I wanted. It's a new summon. This game's really

776
02:46:52,250 --> 02:46:59,700
good. This is just a random dungeon. Just a random little spot. This is really cool. This is awesome.

777
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:10,579
Okay so I can pull this lever though. What does that do? Put them down here? That's probably for

778
02:47:10,579 --> 02:47:33,319
the door. Yep lever. Somewhere a heavy door is open. Nice. Is somebody behind me? That would have

779
02:47:33,319 --> 02:47:43,459
been scary if I had even seen any attention. I was paying zero attention. Zero. Okay so that door

780
02:47:43,459 --> 02:48:07,479
opened. I'm gonna go sit at the bonfire. That's that new move. What does it do? It's like a stun.

781
02:48:07,479 --> 02:48:15,670
Okay that's cool. I'm gonna do a little bit of gamer exercising. I'm turning off online seriously.

782
02:48:15,670 --> 02:48:30,379
I keep thinking it's somebody. All right I'm sitting at the fire. I think I have enough to

783
02:48:30,379 --> 02:48:37,559
level up. Can you level up at any bonfire? Holy Mike is it off? Because I almost just walked into

784
02:48:37,559 --> 02:48:48,409
fire probably. All right where's the- there it is. Because I'm close to the flail. Oh that's really

785
02:48:48,409 --> 02:48:54,219
awesome. You can do it anywhere. All right 17 we need one more point in decks and I can use the

786
02:48:54,219 --> 02:49:07,500
flail. Level your chin up to level two. Good. Is this game like LA and war? Yeah it's like exactly

787
02:49:07,500 --> 02:49:14,540
the same. Each one of these enemy encounters it goes like a zoom in to the enemy's face and

788
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:18,620
you have to decide whether or not you're gonna like trust them or not. Well they go like this.

789
02:49:19,180 --> 02:49:58,229
This is a boss. Entry burial watchdog. What the hell? Okay. Holy shit that that extreme action

790
02:49:58,229 --> 02:50:12,020
figure. Press the button on his back. What the fuck dude? His moves happen in one second.

791
02:50:15,379 --> 02:50:36,010
He's like a GI Joe. How does this- does this hurt him? Oh that hurts him a lot. Let's go.

792
02:50:38,379 --> 02:51:35,159
Spam. Oh get cheeseballed. All right this guy- this guy wasn't that bad. All right that guy

793
02:51:35,159 --> 02:51:51,299
wasn't that bad. Enemy fell. Noble sorcerer ashes. That guy wasn't that bad. Ah weak foe. I did it.

794
02:51:51,299 --> 02:51:58,409
You know what? That person could be- you know you did do it and I rated it poorly again.

795
02:51:59,129 --> 02:52:02,329
That guy- who knows? That person could have like just bought the game from like Walmart today

796
02:52:02,889 --> 02:52:10,659
and I just like- I keep- it's not- it's start and then whatever it's select. It's not start.

797
02:52:11,379 --> 02:52:22,659
Turn to entrance. I'm gonna look like such an asshole. You know now I understand why- oh now

798
02:52:22,659 --> 02:52:27,700
I understand why some videos just have like like 10 dislikes randomly. It's probably because they

799
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:38,299
just like press the wrong button. I get it. I think that's it right? That's- that was cool.

800
02:52:38,299 --> 02:53:00,170
That was a fun one. I just like all of your videos. Find the party. Apologize for what?

801
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:15,780
Oh it's flail time guys. Finally. All right. This helps my casting too because it's casting speed

802
02:53:15,780 --> 02:53:28,659
so that's good. What we got? 109 plus 21. 106. Yeah that's better. FP cost? Okay that's spinning

803
02:53:28,659 --> 02:53:44,420
chain. Let's take a look. Oh that's cool. Nice. What's the uh chart? That's awesome.

804
02:53:49,340 --> 02:53:53,739
It's kind of slow but I think it'll be all right. About two handed.

805
02:54:00,090 --> 02:54:08,860
I love it. What about the weapon art? Let's see. Holy shit that's awesome. What does that do?

806
02:54:09,500 --> 02:54:24,680
Is that a block? It takes up uh FP. I wonder if I can- can I attack out of this?

807
02:54:26,100 --> 02:54:39,690
I can. All right I think I'm gonna use this weapon. What's FP? FP is mana. It's the blue bar.

808
02:54:43,559 --> 02:55:00,120
Very cool. Well that was awesome. I'm gonna check it out. What is it uh- I gotta buy that

809
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:13,450
crafting thing. Can I still kill people with like with a stealth? All right it's a little loud for

810
02:55:13,450 --> 02:55:26,709
me. Music at least. I'm gonna turn the music down just a little bit. Just a little bit. Okay

811
02:55:26,709 --> 02:55:41,899
that's it. Only one notch. So that was here. That was it. Okay that's cool. I wonder what that is.

812
02:55:42,540 --> 02:56:02,219
You might as well spit in the- nevermind. I love this weapon. It is so much better.

813
02:56:04,629 --> 02:56:22,010
This is running away. So this is de- the scaling on this is not great though. Probably gets better.

814
02:56:22,649 --> 02:56:29,020
Can you zoom the map all the way out? Uh I think this is what we have here.

815
02:56:29,739 --> 02:56:47,190
Unless there's more. Is there more? Or is this the whole game? I don't know. There's way more zones.

816
02:56:47,190 --> 02:57:06,469
Oh my god. Uh I see that statue and I raise you going to go see it. This is literally the tutorial.

817
02:57:07,530 --> 02:57:25,370
This is the tutorial. This is so cool. This is so good. Wait let's check this out. I might be able

818
02:57:25,370 --> 02:57:37,559
to kill that guy now. I want to go check out that uh statue up there. Oh wait this is like

819
02:57:37,559 --> 02:58:13,799
another catacombs. Kind of looks like a catacombs. Where's that statue? What's this? Whoa.

820
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:30,819
Ultimate nerd neck. Dude I'm just saying put your monitor up a little higher. So many people the

821
02:58:30,819 --> 02:58:35,700
reason why they like this is because their monitors- put your monitor a little higher

822
02:58:35,700 --> 02:58:41,299
so your eye line is here not here looking down like this is your monitor here you want your

823
02:58:41,299 --> 02:58:50,500
eye line to be right here okay i don't think can i do anything with this holding something

824
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:58,549
that's where that's the okay that's where i was before let me let me do the crafting thing

959
03:40:42,280 --> 03:41:17,930
out get out don't aggro all these nights i didn't think he was close enough i thought he was far i

960
03:41:17,930 --> 03:41:25,219
thought he was too far away to do that use your magic because i used the wolves and it went to

961
03:41:25,219 --> 03:41:31,100
zero and i yeah it's magic andy time all right where what is this last where am i going which is

962
03:41:31,100 --> 03:41:36,420
the last gravesite right that was a goofy reaction yeah i like whoa and drop the controller

963
03:41:38,229 --> 03:41:45,940
okay it's magic on this guy and i thought i could get him with the melee shit

964
03:41:45,940 --> 03:42:02,260
i yeah this is fucking crazy oh man i gotta fight all that shit again but i don't have to i could

965
03:42:02,260 --> 03:42:28,299
just go through it but man do i want to try that's like how's your day it's going it's going good

966
03:42:28,299 --> 03:42:35,850
just kite him outside it's actually probably a better idea to do that probably making this way

967
03:42:35,930 --> 03:42:57,299
more difficult than i have to how's your day is your day good i hope so all right so these people

968
03:42:57,299 --> 03:43:01,780
here i don't it's gonna take a while i think i could fight him out here and plus he'll kill

969
03:43:01,780 --> 03:43:18,170
those guys yeah he'll kill those guys gamer exercises hold on we're good yeah i wonder

970
03:43:18,170 --> 03:43:24,040
if i can let me just get him to come let me just get him to jump down and then i'm just gonna run

971
03:43:24,040 --> 03:43:52,340
out and i'm just gonna run around him and i'm gonna cast my magical spells that's definitely

972
03:43:52,340 --> 03:44:09,510
the strategy for sure don't even go near him unless i have to two at a time two at a time is

973
03:44:09,510 --> 03:44:29,399
fine this is not going to bring him to zero i'm okay i gotta remember he does that this actually

974
03:44:29,399 --> 03:44:43,690
might bring him to zero fuck you yeah i'll get him here i that made that so much more difficult

975
03:44:43,690 --> 03:45:00,680
on myself than i had to holy goodness you're dying got him that was so much easier than i made it

976
03:45:02,309 --> 03:45:13,610
oh geez okay that was way easier okay now i can go take those guys out and be able to be clean

977
03:45:14,329 --> 03:45:19,110
i have some pre-recorded gameplay of me beating this boss if you'd rather just use it

978
03:45:19,829 --> 03:45:34,780
it's not a boss this is a regular guy this is not hitting it's hitting for fucking three oh my god

979
03:45:36,139 --> 03:45:46,420
get off the horse get off the horse it's just what what am i what am i holding this stupid

980
03:45:46,420 --> 03:46:20,840
fencing weapon again can't see your souls oh shit i'll move it he's still alive holy shit

981
03:46:29,139 --> 03:46:36,520
i thought i could get it back stuff it's a mistake don't be cute about it just kill him

982
03:46:37,239 --> 03:46:55,690
we're good everything is fine i can now explore a little bit make sure i get all the items that i

983
03:46:55,690 --> 03:47:13,020
need put on the actual weapon that i should have on and that's kind of cool okay okay so now

984
03:47:13,979 --> 03:47:21,239
i still have a heal which is good you should have been cute about it

985
03:47:21,239 --> 03:47:28,700
no i got the crafting thing i don't know what i should do with it though

986
03:47:34,459 --> 03:47:57,979
i wonder if the big guy respawns you look like a ps2 sopranos character golden rune i don't know

987
03:47:57,979 --> 03:48:02,139
why what does that even mean i i actually kind of don't know what the hell you're talking about

988
03:48:02,139 --> 03:48:17,979
what does that mean ps2 let's move the camera up where should i put it up here here somewhere

989
03:48:17,979 --> 03:48:29,670

all right onward erba mushrooms all right there's a motherfucker right here

992
03:49:14,329 --> 03:49:23,299
actually the bow might not be a bad idea because i'm doing a lot of decks a left bumper for

993
03:49:23,940 --> 03:49:32,729
right to adjust rb arrow one arrow two i mean the game wants me to don't do that

994
03:49:33,450 --> 03:49:56,889
they just blocked all that damage good will you get the fuck out of here

995
03:49:59,670 --> 03:50:20,700
i didn't even get a chance to put the bow on oh nice okay i cleared a camp right

996
03:50:21,739 --> 03:50:35,319
a little bit of me a little bit of me why are you saying that wolves actually have been the best

997
03:50:35,319 --> 03:50:41,219
the sorceress guy was probably might be good later i would imagine might be pretty good later

998
03:50:41,219 --> 03:50:59,930

05:46:41,400 --> 05:46:49,290
why is this guy sneaking up on this dude okay well i got the estus thing which is a huge deal

1347
05:46:50,009 --> 05:47:10,360
what's that there's so much to do so many places just to go look at and explore

1348
05:47:11,000 --> 05:47:29,020

05:48:12,540 --> 05:48:39,860
that there's something there academy scroll cool i'll get stuck you don't know i want to fight these

1352
05:48:39,860 --> 05:48:59,930
guys i want to be able to buy a sorcery thousand runes to buy the thing that i and the thing is my

1353
05:48:59,930 --> 05:49:04,889
favorite part about being on toy story was the fact that i was constantly constantly asked questions

1354
05:49:04,889 --> 05:49:10,650
about uh tom how do you do it how do you actually get in that booth and and and be woody and uh my

1355
05:49:10,650 --> 05:49:15,049
only thing i would say is i just got in there and tried my hardest and that's what i would

1356
05:49:15,049 --> 05:49:19,689
think everybody watching right now should also try their hardest too everybody needs to try

1357
05:49:19,689 --> 05:49:26,659
their hardest and do their best there's no reason not to ever not do your best and i kind of don't

1358
05:49:26,659 --> 05:49:36,549
want to die right now yet because it's gone it's gone it's so i when you get the tom hanks for

1359
05:49:36,549 --> 05:49:42,090
meeting you get to have fun for like 15 seconds and then it's gone it's kind of like lucid dreaming

1360
05:49:42,650 --> 05:49:55,259
if you are if you are aware of tom hanks in your voice you'll lose it okay i gotta pay attention

1361
05:49:55,259 --> 05:50:54,169

1372
05:53:59,000 --> 05:54:21,529
it's gonna look jarring okay i'm gonna give this scroll to him okay study how do i give him the

1373
05:54:21,529 --> 05:54:31,990
thing

1374
05:54:35,110 --> 05:54:45,990
okay so i gotta go there

1375
05:54:55,770 --> 05:55:01,290
you might have guessed the seals are still active making entry to the academy impossible

1376
05:55:01,290 --> 05:55:06,970
without a glintstone key okay so i'm stuck here i need a glintstone key

1377
05:55:20,709 --> 05:55:21,830
oh the glintstone key

1378
05:55:28,229 --> 05:55:31,189
and if you find an extra glintstone key an extra one

1379
05:55:31,830 --> 05:55:37,590
once you've tied up all your loose ends would you consider donating to me can i give them the

1380
05:55:37,590 --> 05:55:51,900
scroll where are you in the game i don't know i just went in a random direction i don't think

1381
05:55:51,900 --> 05:55:58,619
i can give this to him but i really want these really badly which one of these is which one is

1382
05:55:58,619 --> 05:56:04,360
good horizontal arc that spreads outward this force me to cast repeatedly and while in motion

1383
05:56:05,159 --> 05:56:13,639
this is just light and this i think this is the

1384
05:56:17,110 --> 05:56:24,200
from the original game right this is a universal first step on the journey of true knowledge i

1385
05:56:24,200 --> 05:56:37,110
this i like this one the one you have now is it glintstone pebble no it's not i have magic

1386
05:56:37,110 --> 05:56:50,869
glint blade probably looks like the grinch all right well i can't really do that it wants me

1387
05:56:50,869 --> 05:57:04,490
to go that way but i'm gonna go over here or here yeah let's go here put a marker i'm going

1388
05:57:04,490 --> 05:57:16,380

1389
05:57:16,380 --> 05:57:30,409

1390
05:57:31,290 --> 05:58:01,580
okay hey somebody said it looks like you're wearing fake teeth huh fake teeth it's because

1391
05:58:01,580 --> 05:58:16,180

1392
05:58:16,180 --> 05:58:21,540
with the big giant people i'm going that way yeah let's go because i can reliably kill them with

1393
05:58:21,540 --> 05:58:46,090
uh the sorcery now yeah these guys are not a problem now although i might need uh i'll get

1394

1404
06:04:06,279 --> 06:04:12,680
attacks against blockers i feel like it has read an ai sentence enhances stamina reducing attacks

1405
06:04:13,479 --> 06:04:28,779
against a blocker so it makes it easier to break guards okay i kind of

1406

i'm gonna say right first that's a pressure plate i'm gonna step on that and the thing

1448
06:19:16,009 --> 06:19:33,799
something's gonna shoot at me what happens shoot them shoot them shoot them shoot them shoot them

1449
06:19:34,360 --> 06:20:09,849
it's so fucking dark i can't see anything all right well i was trying to get him to get killed by the

1450
06:20:09,849 --> 06:20:20,459
thing did you take the wig off now i'm getting gamer elbows you guys ever get that where you're

1451
06:20:20,459 --> 06:20:40,470
like been your elbows have been on your arm rest for an entire day i don't even give him a chance

1452
06:20:41,029 --> 06:21:03,939
just go just kill fight fight fight did i not pick up my i would have been a shame if i didn't

1453
06:21:03,939 --> 06:21:19,830
get those okay this time don't be stupid they fire straight out just don't step on it use your

1454
06:21:19,830 --> 06:21:41,930
casting abilities to take out these shitheads back is there anybody this like this ceiling right

1455
06:21:41,930 --> 06:22:00,040
they're gonna be behind me yeah i even knew you were there too this is another door all right so

1456
06:22:00,040 --> 06:22:03,639
that's very obviously that's where the boss is a little whatever the little mini bosses

1457
06:22:04,919 --> 06:23:00,470
right i forgot you dude now don't step on the pressure plate all right so we got smithing stone

1458
06:23:00,470 --> 06:23:14,380
very cool i need those root resin again and now we can open up this thing cool cats slow um i think

1459
06:23:16,040 --> 06:23:22,580
if i you know this i would imagine a lot of people are potentially uh potentially have this stream

1460
06:23:22,580 --> 06:23:28,500
in a tab on a different monitor while they are playing through elden ring at the same time

1461
06:23:28,500 --> 06:23:33,340
that's what i would do that's what i would do that maybe you got me onto the background

1462
06:23:33,340 --> 06:23:40,580
maybe you're playing you know you're probably busy and every so often you're looking over here

1463
06:23:40,580 --> 06:23:45,939
to see just how much further you are than i am which i hope you're doing i hope you're doing a

1464
06:23:45,939 --> 06:23:54,340
good job gaming uh i think i'm gonna reset it because that's definitely a boss i actually

1465
06:23:54,340 --> 06:24:01,860
think i'm gonna go buy the new sorcery thing and level up once because i'm kind of terrified of

1466
06:24:01,860 --> 06:24:11,720
this i'm smoking crack fuck video games well i've been okay all your time yeah you shouldn't be

1467
06:24:11,720 --> 06:24:27,959
doing that i'm gonna level up uh intelligence it's not gonna be enough i know i'm not traveled to

1468
06:24:27,959 --> 06:24:35,180
site of grace from this location can i travel back here if i'm outside the dungeon gonna

1469
06:24:35,180 --> 06:25:06,139
teleport inside the dungeon okay i can just making sure in there i'll buy the i only have enough for

1470
06:25:06,139 --> 06:25:33,130
one which one do i want do i want the default spell or do i want the arc spell i don't know

1471
06:25:33,689 --> 06:25:47,139
ours a horizontally widening magic arc this one has more intelligence required 130 in the morning

1472
06:25:47,139 --> 06:25:53,049
you're still going i'll be going for at least another i'd say at least another probably hour

1473
06:25:53,049 --> 06:25:58,340
or two at least can i afford both i want to level up though yeah i guess i'll just get whatever

1474
06:26:04,810 --> 06:26:25,750
and now i have to go tune them right come back let's get to a bonfire

1475
06:26:27,029 --> 06:26:35,529
i will carry for a bit it's fast and spammable oh you like the game i think it's absolutely

1476
06:26:35,529 --> 06:26:53,819
phenomenal so far i keep finding new things to do try this spell i sort of just keep finding

1477
06:26:53,819 --> 06:27:03,900
stuff to do that's it has nothing to do with the main game okay let me see yeah this is the this

1478
06:27:03,900 --> 06:27:07,659
is that spell the original kind of just little cat and it's quick too so now i can actually use

1479
06:27:07,659 --> 06:27:19,060

1499
06:35:24,569 --> 06:35:30,200
your shit a lot of times i hit him with my flail at least like 10 to 20 times too bad i got another

1500
06:35:30,200 --> 06:35:42,259
weapon that's probably incredible that i can't use look at all this cool shit that i can't play

1501
06:35:42,259 --> 06:36:09,299
with it's a weapon art oh it's that this is so heavy yeah but that was awesome um i could eat

1502
06:36:09,299 --> 06:36:25,209
my soul strength getting all the cool gear again you have any souls dude just chose the caveman

1503
06:36:25,209 --> 06:36:31,479
no i mean the battle kind of battle mage stuff is really cool i would like to get a dex weapon

1504
06:36:31,479 --> 06:36:48,250
that i think is a little more comfortable to me open this people need to get out of the strength

1505
06:36:48,250 --> 06:36:59,700
or dex build mindset um i mean i'm trying to do kind of a half and half casting and dex dex

1506
06:36:59,700 --> 06:37:20,759
increases your cast speed so it's gonna be pretty useful okay well that was cool what platform is

1507
06:37:20,759 --> 06:37:27,080
this is on pc pc uh i don't know if the same is on console but pc currently has kind of a weird

1508
06:37:27,080 --> 06:37:33,779
problem where um sometimes a game will just hang and slow down and speed up i'm imagining that over

1509
06:37:33,779 --> 06:37:41,619
the next maybe even a few days or week or something maybe they'll figure that out but regardless of

1510
06:37:41,619 --> 06:37:55,740
that it still is really really fun i'm gonna do the next point into uh vitality and then i'm

1511
06:37:55,740 --> 06:38:15,290
gonna try to fight that boss again going for the boss again reduces fall damage and sound animal

1512
06:38:15,930 --> 06:38:30,380
what is it animal rainbow alleviates blood loss okay so let's head back to i want one more point

1515
06:38:50,229 --> 06:39:07,689

1516
06:39:07,689 --> 06:39:24,810
that though this probably such a there's probably a better staff i don't want to do that it's the

1517
06:39:24,810 --> 06:39:28,490
olympics of video games yeah i mean it's just every three or four years they make one of these

1518
06:39:29,720 --> 06:39:45,830

1531
06:43:03,700 --> 06:43:42,599

1535
06:44:39,020 --> 06:44:46,919

1536
06:44:46,919 --> 06:44:54,020
start to play with like a sorceress you just kind of go like this oh right i have this is a game i

1537
06:44:54,020 --> 06:45:05,740
can't get hit the two or three times that i played through dark souls one and dark souls three with

1538
06:45:05,740 --> 06:45:11,419
sorcery i remember getting to bosses getting them to like five percent health and just getting

1539
06:45:11,419 --> 06:45:18,150
lazy and just still spamming and just losing it's you gotta pay attention still

1540
06:45:19,799 --> 06:46:06,439
all right it's he just moves in fucking slow motion it's so annoying i fucking hate this guy

1541
06:46:07,540 --> 06:46:11,779
i would rather have to have to dodge 50 attacks a minute than have the guy go in slow motion

1542
06:46:18,680 --> 06:46:41,610
smash i'll get him it's just like i haven't been here in like an hour and a half

i had it it's just like dodge dodge dodge dodge like i'm trying not to dodge that much it's just

1546
06:48:17,430 --> 06:48:24,470
like sometimes your brain just goes like do it again do it again do it again do it again and

1547
06:48:24,470 --> 06:49:08,659
i'm just like no stop don't press that fucking button a third time all right okay what is the

1548

1553
06:52:11,380 --> 06:52:18,520
it's the slowest attacks whatever the next boss is if it's even 10% faster than this guy it's

1562
06:58:11,880 --> 06:58:25,349

1563
06:58:25,909 --> 06:58:32,470
it's faster than it is so look at me listen to me wait another full second before you do

1564
06:58:32,470 --> 06:58:38,740
fucking anything his swings are always a full second you understand it's like full two seconds

1565
06:58:38,740 --> 07:00:57,340
longer than you think it is it's a full count more count more i want to punch this fucking guy

1566
07:00:57,340 --> 07:01:11,639
in the face in real life if i was there if i was there i'd kick i would kick the shit out of this

07:25:58,819 --> 07:26:05,849
dodging left dodging right like dodging away he still hits you with it and i swear to god

1617
07:26:05,849 --> 07:26:45,270

1618
07:26:45,270 --> 07:27:04,680
did i not dodge through that poor shit i'm trying to stagger if somebody said i could a heavy attack

damn it dude fuck off i'm telling you right now i press b and i didn't dodge

1625
07:29:48,459 --> 07:30:04,069
start again we're just gonna do it change spells i only have three more more hopping

1626
07:30:04,630 --> 07:30:17,860
it's because you have the worst weapon yeah but i mean i have spells change the spell to this all

1627
07:30:17,860 --> 07:30:22,500
right if i don't beat him in the next like three or four attempts i'm literally gonna eat this

1628
07:30:22,500 --> 07:30:29,930
fucking flail on stream and then i'm gonna get a new weapon i think this is no i'm gonna keep

1629
07:30:30,889 --> 07:30:40,490
pebbles better oh shit i wasn't paying attention all right i pay attention pay attention come on

1630
07:30:40,490 --> 07:30:47,290

1631
07:30:47,290 --> 07:30:52,810
pattern down my brain just cannot do the two speed changes it's making me want to fucking

1632
07:30:52,810 --> 07:31:00,680
just chug this as fast as i can charge the spells i don't think i can charge the spells there's no

1633
07:31:01,880 --> 07:31:09,750
there's no card except no i i have played through all these games without summoning

1634
07:31:09,750 --> 07:31:13,430
anybody with the exception of one or two cases i ain't doing it i'm doing it on my own

1635
07:31:14,069 --> 07:31:27,240
i'm doing it on my own yeah yeah i can't charge this uh hold on let me start hold the button down

1636
07:31:27,799 --> 07:31:44,229
that's what i was just doing how much mana does that use it uses a lot more the boys are

1637
07:31:44,229 --> 07:31:48,520
terrible i would have been i would have literally been in the next area by now

1638
07:31:50,340 --> 07:31:55,060
if i make another joke at the end of a boss fight i will gift 50 million subscriptions

1639
07:31:55,700 --> 07:32:04,220
i will gift 100 trillion subs if i make a joke with one hp left on this guy again

1640
07:32:04,860 --> 07:32:36,889
there's 100 damage okay there's a lot of mana i'm not sure i like this

1641
07:32:37,610 --> 07:32:57,110
i wonder if it's better to actually just try to use the use a melee weapon right i'm i swear

1642
07:32:57,110 --> 07:33:03,220
to god what the fuck man why am i running out of stamina i'm not just noticing that that's weird

1643
07:33:03,700 --> 07:33:17,819
wouldn't be because he i can stagger them you really have to wait to like literally press the

1644
07:33:17,819 --> 07:33:44,139
button to attack me all right hold on so let me get this it's not a bad idea it's not a bad idea

1645
07:33:44,700 --> 07:34:42,099
it's got to have to build up right god damn it i have no my heels either uh something's i swear

1646
07:34:42,099 --> 07:34:47,819
to god something weird is happening i just tried to dodge and it didn't do anything he didn't even

1647
07:34:47,819 --> 07:34:57,080
move he didn't do anything what the fuck what's going on that makes no fucking sense i had the

1648
07:34:57,080 --> 07:35:03,819
same problem oh i'm i am i am not fucking this is not copium i swear to god like sometimes he

1649
07:35:03,819 --> 07:35:15,020
just doesn't dodge what i mean i'm plugged in i'm not i'm not wireless it's copium i swear to god

1650
07:35:15,020 --> 07:35:23,369
it's not copium it's not even input lag it's like it just doesn't work like i'll go dodge and he'll

1651
07:35:23,369 --> 07:35:31,400
just he won't move i had the exact same problem but it was only with this boss really magic has

1652
07:35:31,400 --> 07:35:49,319
end lag i don't think so i didn't cast a spell that was weird i have i had a full bar of stamina

1653
07:35:55,270 --> 07:36:11,159
all right how many attempts have i had on this boss this is like insane like this is crazy have

1654
07:36:11,159 --> 07:36:15,400
i just been so far out of the game with the souls games that i'm just so rusty that i can't beat the

1655
07:36:15,400 --> 07:37:11,159
first boss all right let's go i hate it this is the one

1656
07:37:15,000 --> 07:38:32,229
it's happened again what the fuck is happening is that all right don't let fuck no fucking around

1657
07:38:33,049 --> 07:38:41,750
is that actually a problem at this guy like i swear to god like 10 percent of my inputs are not

1658
07:38:41,750 --> 07:38:57,659
being uh not being done on the dodge it's weird what the fuck's happening is it where the terrain

1659
07:38:57,659 --> 07:39:02,299
is sloped i don't know sometimes it's just like when he when he like goes in the air i don't even

1660
07:39:02,299 --> 07:39:10,889
like attempt to dodge every jump attack the frame issue i i mean it's weird i promise i'm not making

1661
07:39:10,889 --> 07:39:28,419
it up to make it look like i'm not fucking terrible at this game just jumped backwards

1662
07:39:35,479 --> 07:39:41,400
i it's but you heard it you could fucking hear me click it twice twice in a row you heard it i

1663
07:39:41,400 --> 07:40:24,040
swear to god what the fuck is happening you heard me click what it's doing it again

1664
07:40:26,340 --> 07:40:30,259
this is a big problem i now i'm realizing what the fuck's been happening this whole god damn time

1665
07:40:36,169 --> 07:40:50,229
my dodges aren't happening crouching i don't think so get an on screen i'm about to fucking

1666
07:40:50,229 --> 07:40:57,479
sit here and show you like it's just that like that sometimes he just doesn't do it

1667
07:41:00,119 --> 07:41:08,840
need to resupply the copium i'm fucking not fucking around your v-sync is is doo-doo

1668
07:41:14,279 --> 07:41:21,799
you don't have to beat him yeah i mean that's a huge problem if that's what's actually been

1669
07:41:21,799 --> 07:41:31,340
happening because like i feel like i shouldn't be getting hit like half the time is it actually

1670
07:41:31,340 --> 07:41:35,020
the terrain like i'm getting stuck on like a cinder block or something but you won't even do

1671
07:41:35,020 --> 07:44:23,099
the input get his ass get his ass why are the sticks everywhere look at that fucking muscle

1672
07:44:23,099 --> 07:44:44,380
it's bigger than anything you've ever seen guys guys i can't get up my arms are too weak

1673
07:44:50,549 --> 07:45:06,709
oh the dodge is fucked and i'm not kidding the dodge is fucked the dodge is fucked i'm not

1674
07:45:06,709 --> 07:45:23,000
kidding i swear to god this input lag caused by forced v-sync capping your fps under 60 should fix

1675
07:45:23,000 --> 07:45:49,619
it oh thanks for the copium man appreciate it that guy was fucking crazy but i swear i don't that

1676
07:45:49,619 --> 07:45:55,799
probably wouldn't even have been that bad if that wasn't happening i wouldn't have died like 40

1677
07:45:55,799 --> 07:46:01,080
times with that guy if i didn't have like like 10 to 20 percent of my dodges actually where the

1678
07:46:01,080 --> 07:46:15,400
input was there you know what i mean like that's that's great all right i got a ton of this game

1679
07:46:15,400 --> 07:46:21,799
is really good this game is really good fuck that boss throw him in the ocean uh okay so this game

1680
07:46:21,799 --> 07:46:33,270
is good it's very good so oh i got a lot of level up to do you just suck so bad all right fine

1681
07:46:34,599 --> 07:46:51,319
yeah uh oh you think i just suck so bad oh yeah yeah you can do it too wait you said you would

1682
07:46:51,319 --> 07:46:59,110
what what did i say he wouldn't have died so many times if you didn't try to be a funny e clown i

1683
07:46:59,110 --> 07:47:06,470
that's what i know trust me dude i am internally i am i am going to i am internally punishing myself

1684
07:47:06,470 --> 07:47:12,310
right now for that bullshit because like like 10 to 15 more attempts were added because of that

1685
07:47:12,869 --> 07:47:21,419
this person said uh you look like you're having lots of fun back there you said you would eat

1686
07:47:21,419 --> 07:47:25,180
though your flail if you died three times when you're gonna eat it okay so just make sure

1687
07:47:25,180 --> 07:47:30,229
everybody knows uh so i said if i made any more jokes i'll give 100 million subs

1688
07:47:30,869 --> 07:47:35,430
but that was just for that boss that was just for that encounter and it doesn't it's not any

1689
07:47:35,430 --> 07:47:40,790
other encounter like i can make jokes at the other stuff if i want to it was just for that boss i

1690
07:47:40,790 --> 07:47:45,930
wanted to clarify that all right so do i just dump points into endurance and call it a day

1691
07:47:46,729 --> 07:47:55,459
and just never do it again or should i 20 look should we spread it out maybe some more mana

1692
07:47:56,099 --> 07:48:06,810
us two being bad at game thanks for the content it was the dodge it was the dodge it was the dodge

1693
07:48:06,810 --> 07:48:18,459
it was the dodge i'm gonna say let's get this to 15 and then i'll do that looks good to me that

1694
07:48:18,459 --> 07:48:37,900
looks good to me what how long have i been playing for eight hours i want to keep playing though

1695
07:48:37,900 --> 07:48:49,639
how is it it's like midnight but i i'm not done what's the most attempts you ever had on a boss

1696
07:48:50,200 --> 07:49:00,220
uh the last boss in sakiro took me i think six hours it was i believe six hours

1697
07:49:00,220 --> 07:49:25,669
it's beautiful holy shit actually looks phenomenal bring some water i got a huge one right here i've

1698
07:49:25,669 --> 07:49:34,119
been drinking it the whole time i've been watching someone try and beat the tree sentinel literally

1699
07:49:34,119 --> 07:49:41,110
from the moment that you beat it it's fucking not easy man it really isn't don't let anybody tell

1700
07:49:41,110 --> 07:49:44,150
you that these games are like well you see it's fucking simple what you do is you just have to

1701
07:49:44,150 --> 07:49:49,189
go do this and this and instead i i beat him on my first try and by the way jerma like i beat that

1702
07:49:49,189 --> 07:49:54,229
guy in my first try too i turned around in my chair and i beat the guy i actually beat him

1703
07:49:54,229 --> 07:50:00,150
with my fists like these games are hard okay so if anybody ever tells you that first of all say

1704
07:50:00,150 --> 07:50:04,790
you're full of shit because they're full of shit and second of all see one because that's all that

1705
07:50:04,790 --> 07:50:25,979
matters what do you want for dinner um i don't know of a snack i i had a crunchy peanut butter

1706
07:50:25,979 --> 07:50:35,909
bar um i'll take another break in like another let me get to like the next section here and then

1707
07:50:35,909 --> 07:50:47,990
i'll take a break um yeah give me another few minutes you know there's probably people that

1708
07:50:47,990 --> 07:50:53,990
actually can do all this stuff in once like without any problem at all but they also get to see the

1709
07:50:53,990 --> 07:50:59,909
world at like you know point point 0.5 seconds better than everybody else like i told you this

1710
07:50:59,909 --> 07:51:03,669
theory that i have that we all kind of see the world differently some people see the world like

1711
07:51:03,669 --> 07:51:10,150
0.2 percent like 0.2 seconds slower than everybody else some people see the like perceive the world

1712
07:51:10,150 --> 07:51:16,709
0.2 percent faster than everybody else right people that can play games like this i swear

1713
07:51:16,709 --> 07:51:23,669
to god they have like this 0.010 millisecond like slow down that they get to experience

1714
07:51:25,340 --> 07:51:30,380
like i i just don't understand how it's like that reaction time yeah like the world is is like a

1715
07:51:30,380 --> 07:51:40,009
little bit you take it in a little bit slower so you can react faster things it's an alien rant

1716
07:51:43,240 --> 07:51:51,270
no it's not it's still stuck at the tree sentinel yeah keep at it but just don't okay here's what

1717
07:51:51,270 --> 07:51:54,229
here's what happens if you guys are new to playing these games which maybe some of you are

1718
07:51:55,779 --> 07:52:03,979
you just watched me um go through about four or five stages of like i would say grief it's the

1719
07:52:03,979 --> 07:52:09,340
weapon this weapon sucks something's wrong with the weapon yeah fuck this weapon this boss sucks

1720
07:52:09,340 --> 07:52:15,240
this boss is impossible this boss is stupid you know what maybe i can't do it maybe i'll just go

1721
07:52:15,240 --> 07:52:21,799
do something else no you know what i can do it no i can't no fuck this game the game sucks why

1722
07:52:21,799 --> 07:52:26,279
people play this this is the best game i've ever played in my life i i want to tell everybody to

1723
07:52:26,279 --> 07:52:30,119
play this because it's seriously like it's a 10 out of 10 fuck this game i'm refunding it this

1724
07:52:30,119 --> 07:52:35,819
game sucks delete it throw it in the ocean that's literally how everybody plays these games

1725
07:52:38,180 --> 07:52:55,639
every single person is it delay on the webcam it shouldn't be but at the end of the day if you

1726
07:52:55,639 --> 07:53:01,479
continue to go forward and you end up doing it all the copium all the anger all the annoyance

1727
07:53:01,479 --> 07:53:08,330
all the frustration all the my controller is broken in quotes you get this intense feeling

1728
07:53:08,330 --> 07:53:14,090
afterwards of that was awesome i accomplished something crazy because this game is really

1729
07:53:14,090 --> 07:53:19,619
fucking hard and it's really really interesting and then you go back to like okay what's next

1730
07:53:20,069 --> 07:53:21,909
that's why these games are so much fun

1731
07:53:49,270 --> 07:54:02,340
really i don't know if i trust this dude use the main gate or sneak around

1732
07:54:03,220 --> 07:54:17,380
i think i'm just going to the front door what do you think looks like a trustworthy fellow

1733
07:54:18,020 --> 07:54:31,659
no i'm using the main gate

1734
07:54:57,270 --> 07:54:58,310
no i'm using the main gate

1735
07:54:58,549 --> 07:55:12,619
when you approach the gate it's only your neck on the thank you idiot uh so here's the main gate

1736
07:55:13,740 --> 07:55:36,840
open the gate this is the main gate hello open the gates that was much easier than i thought

1790
08:11:56,360 --> 08:12:00,279
go sleep and wake up and play the game like that's essentially what's gonna happen here

1791
08:12:07,459 --> 08:12:47,849
not dealing with that we can throw him into the ocean get up did he get it off no he didn't

1792
08:12:47,849 --> 08:13:14,919
i thought that was me screaming i mean that's i do kind of don't you think about falling off that

1793
08:13:14,919 --> 08:13:19,000
edge don't you think about falling off that edge don't even think about blowing that horn either

1794
08:13:22,169 --> 08:13:32,330
where's my spell oh my god you idiot you're not even funny i did i sat there and was like you're

1795
08:13:32,330 --> 08:13:37,639

1796
08:13:37,639 --> 08:13:43,459
like psyching myself up you're gonna have a good fucking show today you're gonna be fucking funny

1797
08:13:43,459 --> 08:13:46,979

1799
08:13:58,810 --> 08:14:25,099
driver like what am i doing i can't reach him from here i hear a patter of little footsteps

1800
08:14:25,099 --> 08:14:32,220
in here i just looked at how weird i looked on face cam like that's why i don't even ever use it

1801
08:14:32,860 --> 08:14:48,419
that's not what i was doing visions of a hidden path there is no hidden path

1802
08:14:49,459 --> 08:15:22,580
could this be item no it's not let's go down first let's get to that

1803
08:15:25,880 --> 08:15:45,500
oh fall from the ceiling hook claws what holy shit he's ugly

1804
08:15:50,060 --> 08:16:11,319
oh okay that's actually kind of good i think it's a weapon art does it have one

1805
08:16:11,319 --> 08:16:26,259
can i do this in two can i hold my hand and do oh i can it's a dash i think this might be a good

1806
08:16:26,259 --> 08:16:40,040
idea what's the scaling on it how bad is it xc and it has lead build up how much is the flail

1807
08:16:40,680 --> 08:16:49,880
lead 50 so it's flail does more damage but has worse scaling i don't know i'll try it for a

1808
08:16:49,880 --> 08:17:27,860
little while wolverine mage i'll try it for a little bit why not nothing else clearing a path

1809
08:17:36,150 --> 08:17:56,919
very good very good very good i don't have no health push as well that's not good oh right like

1810
08:17:56,919 --> 08:18:05,099
holly was talking about dinner i don't know when i uh um when i go on break figure out what that's

1811
08:18:05,099 --> 08:18:14,459
going to be something really interesting about this game so far it's something that seems to

1812
08:18:14,459 --> 08:18:18,299
be missing from the game that's in every single one of these games pretty much besides i don't

1813
08:18:18,299 --> 08:18:24,229
remember being in sekiro maybe not it's a shortcut so you don't really need them anymore because

1814
08:18:24,229 --> 08:18:33,900
there's an open world game this person's freaking me out so smoldering butterfly

1815
08:18:35,159 --> 08:19:04,659
i had him over there he's gonna have a 2 a.m dinner oh i this might be one of those weird

1816
08:19:05,459 --> 08:19:21,369
like my energy is still at like a nine i feel fine i feel great i don't feel fatigued at all

1817
08:19:21,369 --> 08:19:42,729
like actually at all i got a lot of these oh shit oh we gotta go back up you'll feel it tomorrow

1818
08:19:44,599 --> 08:19:51,080
yeah but what was okay since all of the medical bullshit when was the last time that there really

1819
08:19:51,080 --> 08:19:57,060
was like an eight plus nine plus ten plus hour stream it's been a long time and i mean if you're

1820
08:19:57,060 --> 08:20:09,909
only gonna get these every so often then why not this is i'm very invested that's adrenaline

1821
08:20:09,909 --> 08:20:23,610
speaking i'm all right i'm telling you i ate a big salad today what the fuck just happened dude

1822
08:20:24,409 --> 08:20:40,139

1823
08:20:46,819 --> 08:20:58,439
yeah i thought i could fucking parry him i just didn't get it off i thought i could just go wham

1824
08:20:58,439 --> 08:21:12,200
i thought it looks like i looked like i got it i mean all right get back up there that's so far

1825
08:21:12,200 --> 08:21:23,540
away i can get back up there now i know that's what that's what's happening

1826
08:21:29,830 --> 08:21:40,389
finally i can take this helmet off you know i'm gonna save my magic because i feel like i'm

1827
08:21:40,389 --> 08:22:36,740
really gonna need it i'm already kind of screwed here um jeff wordy i gotta get out there i gotta

08:22:36,740 --> 08:23:00,419
parry that dude i really i gotta get in there parry his ass give me the shield i'll get it right

1829
08:23:00,419 --> 08:23:24,250
now i love sorcery so much you call me cheeseball all you want it's so it's so much fun although

1830
08:23:24,250 --> 08:23:30,229
sorcery like i was saying in the middle of my rage induced bullshit sorcery is cool but there

1831
08:23:30,229 --> 08:23:36,389
are some bosses in this game and all the other games where you just cannot do it it the fact

1832
08:23:36,470 --> 08:23:46,389
that you need the standing still for that one second is enough to die but it's great for like

1833
08:23:46,389 --> 08:23:50,389
85 percent of the entire other the rest of the game which is why this is actually good to do kind

1834
08:23:50,389 --> 08:23:58,069
of a battle mage because i'll still be able to use be able to actually fight things with my hands

1835
08:23:58,869 --> 08:24:27,849
all right let's go parry oh you thought the darkness was your ally boy you were blinding

1844
08:27:05,979 --> 08:27:14,779
guard counters i don't think i've done that once we tried holding the attack button

1845
08:27:14,779 --> 08:27:18,459
power attack with sorcery yeah it doesn't work yeah look holding left uh bumper

1846
08:27:19,340 --> 08:27:29,560
you can't uh charge it maybe i learned that later okay cool that's a cool thing to get it's for

1847
08:27:29,560 --> 08:27:41,720
shields um i might actually go back to the bonfire but maybe not see if i can keep going

08:39:45,240 --> 08:39:54,009
this actually gave me superpowers this is a peanut butter cliff bar that and a salad apparently

1886

1887
08:40:06,779 --> 08:40:22,069
thing it was the green tea thing probably right well that worked was it a chicken parm no it

1888
08:40:22,069 --> 08:40:29,110
wasn't chicken parm it was like okay i had a salad of like a matcha green tea powder like drink

1889
08:40:31,849 --> 08:40:54,090
this is the guy that just okay you're annoying it was a salad the green tea powder and that

1890
08:40:54,090 --> 08:41:23,209
flip bar okay i've made it here this is where i died last time interesting brick hammer is that

1891
08:41:23,209 --> 08:41:38,970
dex because that's kind of cool oh it's strength now this is the real caveman weapon yeah it's just

1892
08:41:38,970 --> 08:41:47,209
like a it's just like a block of cement with some rebar i actually i think this item is in dying

1893
08:41:47,209 --> 08:42:09,139
light i also got this too this lord sword great sword this is a little bit more strength too

1894
08:42:09,139 --> 08:42:13,299
it's kind of like a long sword it's really cool it's nice looking it looks cool

1895
08:42:15,779 --> 08:42:30,459
i'll go i'll stick to the claws they're fast claws are much faster than the um the flail so

1896
08:42:31,700 --> 08:42:46,540
but that's what was up here so now where the hell do i go now i can't really go up from here

1897
08:42:47,259 --> 08:43:07,939
oh yeah i can this is where i was before though how do i go up from here there's the stairs you

1898
08:43:07,939 --> 08:43:36,380
didn't want to oh that's right okay yep that makes sense i fell off accidentally i'm on pst and i

1899
08:43:36,380 --> 08:43:54,009
want to go to bed um yeah but elden ring hogchamp it's all right i'm gonna be playing this all week

1900
08:43:54,009 --> 08:44:04,020
so don't worry and i'm not gonna rush through the game this is the most focus i've ever seen

1901
08:44:04,020 --> 08:44:09,770
you in a game ever i mean the from software series are some of my favorite games ever so

1902
08:44:11,189 --> 08:44:19,029
i i love this this is so i love getting angry at games like this i love getting super into it

1903
08:44:19,029 --> 08:44:25,110
i love finding things i love scavenging i love and this is like the ultimate version of that

1904
08:44:25,110 --> 08:44:28,069
because it's open world and i don't even know what direction i'm going i'm just going in one

1905
08:44:28,790 --> 08:44:54,979
and i will be very honest because i have to be it's real close to being at the same caliber

1906
08:44:55,939 --> 08:45:02,840
of the first like five to ten hours of bloodborne for me i actually think it might have an edge

1907
08:45:02,840 --> 08:45:10,069
just simply because i you don't have to go in a certain direction it might have the edge but

1908
08:45:10,150 --> 08:45:18,819
that first real boss made me want to gouge my eyeballs out don't move when he can't see you
