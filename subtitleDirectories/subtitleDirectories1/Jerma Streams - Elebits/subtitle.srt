1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:45,939
Oh shit, what happened? All right, hold on. Let's skip suffocation. Oh thank god it's,

2
00:00:45,939 --> 00:01:00,679
Elevitz is actually in here. Oh thank god. My goodness, imagine if it wasn't. Okay,

3
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:29,500
all right, let's go. Elevitz, you're gonna like this one. I don't know, what am I titled the

4
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,099
stream now? Like fucking magical creatures? Finding magical creatures? You like clean a house in this

5
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,459
game. I'm gonna love this. I was gonna save this for like tomorrow because this is what I was

6
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,939
thinking about doing tomorrow, but we're doing it today because these fucking video games I'm lied to.

7
00:01:43,980 --> 00:02:04,840
Scam recovery. Let's go. I have to buy rabbits again. Elevitz is such a good game. Oh I know.

8
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:17,689
Sometimes you gotta pull out the big ones. Searching for magical creatures. There you go.

9
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:37,860
Your face cam. This game is actually like the ultimate PogChamp. You guys are gonna love this

10
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:47,080
game. All right, story mode, multiplayer, extras, we're gonna do story. In this tutorial you can

11
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,919
learn how to play the game and view advanced tips. Would you like to start the tutorial? Yes!

12
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,319
Oh fuck, hold on. This is searching for magical creatures with Cabela's Deer Hunt still on the

13
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:25,639
game title. How about, I don't know, clean your room. Clean your room. Done. Here we go. With the

14
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,560
remote, pointing at the sensor bar, slowly move it left and right to look, stop being so tangled

15
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:38,150
or I'll bite it. Okay, you can also look up and down, look up and down, left and right.

16
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,099
Let's give it a try. Let's try. It's really, it's really like high quality fluid game too.

17
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:56,460
It's really, really fluid and high quality. Okay, next step. Try slowly moving the cursor up,

18
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,939
down, left, and right. You move the camera. This is a really high quality fluid fucking experience.

19
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:16,120
Keep it in the blue frame. Slowly move the cursor up and down and keep it in there.

20
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:28,149
This is an incredible game. Yeah, I know. It was either this or I was gonna put in Beautiful Joe.

21
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:46,259
I had to, I gotta pull out all the stops here. Let's learn how to move. Move forward by slowly

22
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,060
tilting the nunchucks control stick forward. Tilt the control stick backwards and move backwards.

23
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,459
Tilt it left right. You move. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The thing to remember here is to point the

24
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:03,220
Wii remote the direction you wish to move. Let's give it a try. All right, let's see if we go.

25
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:12,149
Ready? Pick it up. This is moving up, down, you strafe, you tilt. All right, now let's do it with

26
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:22,490
the, with the controller. This is VR movement. You guys don't understand. This game is one of

27
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,060
this. This is probably the best game, probably like one of the top 10 games on the Wii and you're

28
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,740
about to see it live and in person on German 985. I'm selling this game up so high because

29
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,490
the last hour and 40 minutes has been a disaster. So I'm trying to just keep you here. All right,

30
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:51,860
let's learn how to crouch or C to stretch Z to crouch. That's a stretch and that's how you

31
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:03,100
scrunch. Stretch, scrunch, stretch, scrunch. Good. Live from Las Vegas and I got a face cam on.

32
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:11,509
Are you serious? What a day to stick around on the stream. Please, god, don't fucking leave.

33
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,860
Grabbing objects or catching elements is referred to as capturing. Let's learn how to capture an

34
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,620
object. You can grab objects by holding the capture beam over them during the game.

35
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:26,980
Press the A button or the B button of the Wii remote to shoot out the capture beam.

36
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,779
The beam will shoot while the button is down. If an object is too heavy, the cursor will turn

37
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,699
red while you point at it and you will be able to grab but not capture it.

38
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:55,420
Let's go. People saying F. F. Why F? While holding an object, move the Wii remote in the desired

39
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:08,360
gray. You can move it left, right, up, down. Why are people doing F? Oh, it's the block. Okay.

40
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,579
While holding an object, move the Wii remote back into pull it, move it forward to move it.

41
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,379
Yeah, you go like this. Twist the Wii remote left or right while holding an object to tilt

42
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:19,399
that object. You can open the doors. Try moving the red object into the red frame

43
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:41,079
and the blue object into the blue frame. Let's give it a try. Go. Got it. This is not a toddler

44
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:47,079
game. This is a cleaning game, which means I'm going to play them all. All right, we're almost

45
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:54,060
done. I'm going to have to back up a little bit I think here, which means I have to put pants on.

46
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,699
We're going to have to take a break and I'm going to have to put like fucking pants and like underwear

47
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:02,540
on and stuff. Like, uh, that's just, I'm just giving you real. Next, let's learn how to capture

48
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:09,290
an elephant. Look at these little things. An elephant is a living entity with a mysterious

49
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,709
energy. If you capture one, that energy will cause various things to happen. After an elephant

50
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,709
pointed it with the cursor and pushed the A button, the elephant enters your capture gun and tank

51
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,470
as watts. Watts of the game's unit of energy collect watts to fill the light bulb gauge,

52
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:31,110
which will turn blacked out lights back on. Give it a try. Here we go. After the yellow goods.

53
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:53,190
He's going to get banned one day. I've got him. All right, that's it. I'm going to take a break

54
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:58,309
here in a second and I'm going to put on clothes. I have clothes on, but it'd be more appropriate

55
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:07,000
clothes because I'm going to have to fucking move back for this. How to use capturing to do various

56
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,700
things. You can use the capture gun to grab and open or close drawers. Yep. Grab a drawer and pull.

57
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:28,340
Let's give it a try. Let's try it. There's an elegant mirror. You search for these things

58
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:35,509
through the whole house and you get them all and you can use them to turn on stuff. That's how you

59
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:42,379
turn a faucet or doorknob. Use the capture gun to grab a faucet and twist it. Let's go. Sometimes

60
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:49,240
they come out of the water. This game sucks. No, it does not. That's so, so unbelievably wrong.

61
00:09:50,120 --> 00:10:09,179
It's such a good game. Yes, it is. Elephants are hiding. Grab items and shake them. You just go

62
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:28,169
like this. Okay. Okay. Got it. You're trying to hype this game. We'll see. We'll see how you feel

63
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:38,330
about 15 minutes. Thought break sound. What about it? This would make a good VR game.

64
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:46,340
It would. Elephants love small nooks and crannies and to hide between under things.

65
00:10:46,340 --> 00:11:00,600
Find and capture them to turn the lights back on. Let's go. I'm going to have to stand up for this.

66
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,370
You're going to see the full boomer race. This is, I think this might turn into a stand up stream.

67
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:26,600
All right. What else we got? Here we are. Get them all. Yeah, this is going to be a stand up stream,

68
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:38,039
I think. The pants on. Don't worry. I'm going to. All right. Now the lights turn back on.

69
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:49,960
Would you like to do the next tutorial? Yeah. Streamer stands for the first time in six years.

70
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,820
Stages include doors that won't open until you have enough watts. The doors show how many watts

71
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:21,379
are required to open them. See? Let's go. A door somewhere just opened. Oh, there it is.

72
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:41,610
Let's go. Excuse me. This is a Pikmin ripoff. Oh, that's. No, that's not even remotely. That's

73
00:12:41,610 --> 00:13:01,690
not. Just wait. Just wait 10 minutes. This is a stand up comedy stream. This game sucks. Oh, man.

74
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,080
Imagine if you just didn't know. Imagine if you didn't know. You know what I mean? I can't

75
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:15,059
imagine not knowing. Okay. Electrical appliances display the amount of watts required to use them.

76
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,220
So once you gather enough watts, they will turn on. Once an appliance is usable, point at the

77
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,960
switch with the butt sensor and press the A button after the cursor changes. Turn on the appliance.

78
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:51,799
150 for that. EV is energized. Turn it on. Look at that. What do you mean? What sensor?

79
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,750
Okay. Increased capturing power. I'm just getting my memory refreshed. You're stealing cable.

80
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:12,870
Oh, it's kind of pog, I guess. When you use an electrical appliance, yellow and pink

81
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,669
elements come out. These elements are called power elements. Capture power elements to charge

82
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:23,269
up your captures gun power gauge. Build this gauge to level up the gun's capture power.

83
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,110
When the level increases, you can carry heavier objects. Capture power elements and level up your

84
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:57,899
capture power. Interesting. TV energized. Let's go. Telephone energized. I can now carry 2.2

85
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:28,870
kilograms of material. Look at that. The game still sucks. You're making a mess. All right.

86
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:42,200
Review what you've learned so far and capture even more elements. The movement's so fun, too.

87
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:50,519
A door somewhere has opened. Good. We're not done collecting elements.

88
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,980
Telephone has been energized. Toy train energized. Let's go.

89
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:13,450
Gotta get them all. Open the fucking door.

90
00:16:14,250 --> 00:17:06,779
Okay. I gotta stand up. Here we go. Ready? Oh, level three. Open everything. This would be a wicked

91
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:14,089
fun VR game. I know it would. All right. We got it. This is Viscera cleanup details are the worst.

92
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,250
What's with you guys today and only giving games like 12 seconds before you want to change?

93
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:30,059
What's going on with you guys today? This is like one of the best Wii games to release.

94
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:40,339
We can smell when a game sucks. Oh, no, you cannot. No, you cannot. I refuse to have you

95
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:48,259
guys say that this game sucks. It's like saying that Mario Sunshine sucks. I mean, it doesn't.

96
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,140
Okay. Items may have special effects such as temporarily improving gun capture performance.

97
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:01,240
Check this out. Grab an item and smash it to activate it. Here we go. Ready?

98
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:28,970
Homing laser locks on and grabs multiple elements. There are lots of items you can get.

99
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:45,240
Now this is my dopamine levels just exploded. Yeah. Elevates are emotional living beings that

100
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,279
cry, dance, and even run away in terror. Depending on the state of an elephant when you capture it,

101
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,200
the amount of watts you acquire will also vary. When an elephant is running away,

102
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,039
its watts will decrease and the bubble that appears when you capture it will turn red.

103
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,720
When an elephant is stressed or unconscious, they provide a normal number of watts. This

104
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,279
capture bubble will be white. Elevates that are sleeping or singing provide a higher

105
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,160
number of watts. This capture bubble will be as blue. Watch the elevates' actions carefully

106
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:19,880
and try capturing in the different states. All right. That one was having fun. Someone's sleeping.

107
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,839
That one's confused. That one's crying. See how it was different. Okay. Now let's like scare them.

108
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:41,559
Let's like throw a box over here. EM pulse ball knocks out all elevates in a range. Oh, it just

109
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:48,819
has to be around. Okay. They're all sleeping when this is around. And it makes them just

110
00:19:49,380 --> 00:20:08,950
trying to collect. This game gets really fucking hard too. All right. What about here? Fleeing is

111
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:19,579
red. Yeah. You want to try to get them in a good state. Get to the first boss. Elevate cookie

112
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:26,059
attracts elevates for a time. So you go like this and they'll go after it. Go get that cookie. Wake

113
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:40,940
up. Eat this cookie. Oh, you're all idiots. Whatever. I only have this in all the items,

114
00:20:40,940 --> 00:21:02,869
right? Do I have to just get them all? All right. We're good. Nice work. Electrical appliances.

115
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:16,920
Didn't we already do this? Gotta catch them all. Just skip the tutorial. Point to various places

116
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,440
with the cursor and look for activation methods. Some objects are activated in combination with

117
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,180
other objects by grabbing parts and moving them. All right. You can turn on like the coffee makers

118
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:49,289
and shit. Okay. I think we're almost done. You're getting hard blinks chat. The legendary pink

119
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:54,920
elevates are the rarest of all. Capturing them unlocks a new game mode. You gotta, you gotta

120
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:01,980
catch them all. Look at them. There are always three pink elevates on each non-boss stage and

121
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,299
they will appear in different ways. The first hides normally, but the second is in a potter's shoe,

122
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:10,539
which you will eat eventually. The third appears next. Once the special conditions are met,

123
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:16,680
find them all. There. You happy?

124
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,539
All right. Watch the fucking opening cut scene where I go put on pants.

125
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:45,289
Over to their research lab and left me at home. I don't care. My favorite show will be on TV soon.

126
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:58,630
Huh? That's right. Electricity and cars only work because of elevates, you know.

127
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:19,180
Wouldn't even be able to watch TV without them. Pick them up with my fair hands. I know. I'll use

128
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:21,259
Dad's capture gun.

129
00:24:38,150 --> 00:25:45,690
Hey, look, we're in my room. I can choose the music.

130
00:25:48,099 --> 00:26:02,180
You went to go buy raving rapids. What music do I want? No shit. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait,

131
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,059
wait, wait. I'm not ready. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it.

132
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:13,619
I can't. You can't pause the game. All right. Screenshot. Here. Now I can move back a little.

133
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:35,640
Let me move the mic. Let me move the camera. Full backpack cam. Incoming. He's wearing overalls.

134
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:51,339
No, I've got my fucking like bionic chest plate. I've got my, I've got my carapace on. Level one

135
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:58,259
armor. Yeah, this is, this is like fighting game person armor. You know what I mean? This is like

136
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:03,539
the, oh yeah. Am I protected? Just don't hit me here, here, here, here, here, here, here, or

137
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:14,779
anywhere, anywhere else in my whole body. PUBG armor. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready to fucking

138
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:25,740
play this game. No, the camera's not even in the right spot. Fucking big ass arm. Wait a minute.

139
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:59,720
Wait a minute. Why does that look like that? Oh my God. I'm gonna play the game now.

140
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:08,200
Unless it's the angle. I'm moving, I'm changing the angle. All right, we're good.

141
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,539
Are you ready for this fucking game? I'm ready. Here we go. 350 watts. Turn TV on.

142
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:33,220
Don't wake him up. Yeah, I know what it does. Fucking Igor. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

143
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:49,859
Anybody in there? Stretch my head up. Okay, good. I can't, I don't have enough. Wait, hold on.

144
00:28:50,500 --> 00:29:04,740
TV turned on. We got ready. I have enough, right? No, not, I don't have enough. Fuck.

145
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:13,670
How do I leave the house? Can I leave the room? Not yet. Toy train's been energized. Turn it on.

146
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:34,390
All right, I got level two power. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Open up, open, open.

147
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:46,549
How do I turn this fucking thing off? All right, the lights are on. Finally. All right. Under the

148
00:29:46,630 --> 00:30:08,299
bed. TV's on. Turn it on, turn it on. Come on, come on, turn it on. Get in there. Smash the TV.

149
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:40,569
No, no, no, not yet, not yet. Fuck out of the way. Rip it off the fucking wall. Why,

150
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:45,079
why am I doing this in this kid's room? I still don't have any more.

151
00:30:51,369 --> 00:31:07,930
Holy shit, what's in there? Blue RC car has been energized. Where is it?

152
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:16,859
Oh, I am the kid. Where's the blue RC car? I just like, it's like a fucking robbery. All right.

153
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:38,220
Where's the RC car? There it is. What? Where's the car? How much do I need? 1200 watts. Fuck.

154
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:51,859
I need more than that. Come on. This is literally the opposite of cleaning.

155
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:55,220
Oh, there's the car, there's the car. Oh, there it is. Okay, it's over here.

156
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:03,910
Level three. Finally. All right, we can pick up the bed. Pick up the desk.

157
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:33,349
Um, got them all. You can clear the mission without, you can clear the mission without

158
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:42,869
completing. Continue? I mean, I did it, right? Wait, I don't understand. You can clear the mission

159
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:53,660
without completing? Just keep going? Just say yes? No? Total capture 97. I gotta fucking see.

160
00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:06,059
Gotta see. You have to clean everything. No, I don't. You can now play this mode and score attack.

161
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:18,220
Cool. You can keep powering up, right? Okay. Next level. Mission two.

162
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:23,529
Play normal missions. You proceed through the game. Here we go. We're in the hallway.

163
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:35,579
The game is unnerving. Why? You like collect little creatures.

164
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:43,349
Elebits in the closet. Capture a thousand watts of elebits in 10 minutes. Go. I want to get in there.

165
00:33:43,349 --> 00:34:06,059
Here they come. Ready? Slow, slow, slow, slow. I don't want to, like, wake them all up.

166
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:22,230
Here we go. Don't want to make everybody freak out. Hair dryer has been energized. All right,

167
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:28,980
where's the hair dryer? Where's the hair dryer? Oh shit, there's a cookie. Okay, hold on.

168
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:37,530
Electric drill. I don't want to use these cookies yet. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Get this out here.

169
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:46,699
All right, turn it on over here. I need a thousand, right? Yeah, the music's fucking good.

170
00:34:47,340 --> 00:35:09,099
Flashlights energized. Keep that open. Can't pick these up. Flashlight. Shit. Flashlight. Come on.

171
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:29,340
Flashlight. Floor lamp. All right, floor lamp. Here we go. Turn it on. Let's go. Wait, they're

172
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:34,099
stressed. They're stressed out. I don't want to capture them when they're stressed.

173
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:44,889
Wait, they're stressed. They're stressed out. I don't want to capture them when they're stressed.

174
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:57,880
475? What else was it? More subs? Five subs from you posted cringe, bro. Ten subs from you

175
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,119
posted cringe, bro. I'm sorry about that. Didn't mean to. Thanks for the ten community subs.

176
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:11,269
Uh, thanks a lot. And then SNK had ten community subs while I was gone.

177
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:16,920
Thanks a lot, guys. All right, I can pick shit up now. What do I want to pick up?

178
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:34,869
Let's get this stuff out of here. The door somewhere could be open. Oh, shit. They're

179
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:42,519
on the- they're down here on the stairs. Why is that one dead? Which door opened? This one?

180
00:36:48,809 --> 00:37:09,159
Open. I took too long, so he died. Oh, shit. Okay. There we go. Here it is. All right. How is

181
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:18,860
there nobody in there? Why do you have a fucking urinal in your house? Why is there a- why is

182
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:34,860
there a- actually that's pretty fucking- that's incredibly smart. I would love to have a urinal

183
00:37:34,860 --> 00:38:14,039
in my house. Got ya. You can't hide from me. Urinal. This is like Superman's piss. Blue piss.

184
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:42,070
Nothing else in here, right? Dr. Manhattan. All right. There we go.

185
00:38:50,980 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm blocking myself in the bathroom. No, get the fuck out of my way. Go out the bathroom.

186
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:20,360
No, I'm staying. I'm staying. I'm staying. Look at all these things energized over here now.

187
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,630
I can open this. All right. We're gonna throw the cookie. I'm gonna- okay, I'm gonna turn on a bunch

188
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:30,329
of shit. And I'm gonna- here we go. You ready? I want that cookie. I'm gonna get the cookie ready.

189
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:38,150
I'm gonna make sure I get them happy. I already checked this out. Let's get this open.

190
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,110
I know. I know people like- I know they like the cookies. I get it. Everybody loves fucking

191
00:39:45,110 --> 00:40:00,780
cookies. 30 seconds for the cookie. Turn it all on. Turn everything on. Quick. Go get the cookies.

192
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:26,630
That was it? 30 seconds to turn this on? Legendary. I got the legendary.

193
00:40:49,690 --> 00:41:03,619
Honey, what's going on upstairs? Sorry, sweetheart. I was gonna find these little weird fucking

194
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:19,510
creatures and pick them up. Honey, there's nothing up here. Yes, there is. You don't see them?

195
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:46,260
Honey, honey, you're just pissing all over the place. Sorry, I'm not very tall, but I'm using my

196
00:41:46,260 --> 00:42:27,219
elitist radar. Why is it still locked? Get this out. Oh, okay. Shaking shit. All right, move it out.

197
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:52,500
Get it out of the way. One minute. I've destroyed everything. What else is there to fucking break?

198
00:42:53,619 --> 00:43:07,849
Oh yeah, that screen title is Clean Your Room. This is not how you clean a room. That's- yes.

199
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:17,449
I am- yeah. Oh, wait, this is the bathroom, right? I think I got everything I can.

200
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:44,500
Chibi Robo prequel. All right, any more? One here. I think I got everything. Not much else to move.

201
00:43:48,519 --> 00:44:06,469
Oh, yes, there is. What's in the corner here? Umbrella. Come on. Wait, I can- I could go down

202
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:17,800
the stairs? I thought I couldn't go downstairs. I thought it was just the closets. Hey, there's an A.

203
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:46,519
You can edit shit? How would you edit? Are you drinking Windex? Sure. Windex is blue.

204
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:52,250
People can- that's a fucking feature, whatever. I don't care. People are gonna make fun of me.

205
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:12,789
At all the grocery stores, all the fucking water is gone. And sometimes, in some of them, what's

206
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:19,269
left is like the expensive stuff. So this is all that was available to buy at the grocery store

207
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:34,380
because all the fucking other water is gone. Just boil the water. All right, mom and dad's room.

208
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,579
1,500 watts of elevates for mom and dad's room. Music number three, let's go.

209
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:50,889
Get this one clean. Don't break that cookie. Don't break that cookie. Not yet.

210
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:07,739
Get them all in the middle of the room. I'm gonna press these all at the same time.

211
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:27,989
Don't play. Don't do it yet. Come here, you little shit. Epson picture mate.

212
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:46,230
Door somewhere could be open. All right, hold on. All right, I'm ready to start turning these on.

213
00:46:51,929 --> 00:47:18,869
All right, here we go. Fuck. Sorry. Ready? Turn this on. Break it. Break it. Here we go.

214
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:45,670
Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't break. Don't throw the whole thing over. Fun. Another one. Level two.

215
00:47:45,670 --> 00:48:14,820
Level two. Hurry up. Just lost that shit under the bed. Turn the lamp on. Missing on the lamp.

216
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:43,000
All right, stay still. Mini TV has been energized. All right, where is it?

217
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:51,019
All right, I just locked myself in here. Actually did. I don't think I can leave.

218
00:48:51,900 --> 00:49:23,460
It's all right. Shirts. Move them. Why can't I move the shirts?

219
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:39,610
It can't be opened yet. Why? What? That lamp has been energized. All right, let's go.

220
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:44,010
This should put me over the... Wait, can I pull the bed?

221
00:49:44,010 --> 00:50:09,960
I'm like major focusing right now. Anybody in there? Anybody in here? No.

222
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:16,230
Antique radio. I got to get the fuck out of the bedroom.

223
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:34,019
Let me out of the bedroom, please. I can't move the books. One, two, three,

224
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:50,409
four, five, one, four, two, four. I don't know what this is. Shredder activated. All right,

225
00:50:50,409 --> 00:51:16,570
there's a lot of shit in here that's activated. Bro, these urns. Flashlight has been activated.

226
00:51:18,650 --> 00:52:05,159
No. What do you mean grandpa? Oh, turn it on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

227
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:15,610
Oh, it hurts. Turn the fucking thing on for God. Turn it on. What the fuck?

228
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:57,050
Ugh. Cookie, cookie, cookie, smash cookie. Yeah, I got it. I'm gonna stick around. I'm

229
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:05,769
gonna destroy all these books. This is the satisfying part of the whole mission.

230
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:09,880
Watch out, the police are coming. Wait, out here. This is all the shit I can do out here, right?

231
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,500
All these drums open in the rung.

232
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:32,730
Am I strong enough to move this shit? How can I not be this strong?

233
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:55,769
There are, there's like a, like, there's like a piss joke here with like the Sith piss versus

234
00:54:55,769 --> 00:55:02,579
fucking Luke Skywalker piss. I don't know if I can make it right now though. I just have to pee

235
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:25,289
into each other. Whatever. It's there somewhere. Oh, that's cringe, bro. Oh, I might need to tighten

236
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:39,579
this. He's not even making jokes. No, I'm not. I might have to actually tighten this. What did

237
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:49,940
I mess up here? What's the vest for? Uh, there's a whole lot of it. You would like a new tutorial.

238
00:55:49,940 --> 00:56:05,960
What's this, what is this for? This is an improved boomer brace? Kind of. All right, I'll give you the

239
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,159
TLDR. I have a really bad pain in my ribs and my spine. I might have rheumatoid arthritis and

240
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,400
costochondritis and I have to wear this sometimes because my whole body hurts. There you go, there's

241
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:27,079
the TLDR. All right. Breakable objects have a mark on the lower right. Be careful when handling

242
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:32,860
these objects. If you drop or throw these objects, they will break. Gently put them back down. Else,

243
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,380
keep in mind that fleeing elements can crash into objects and knock them down. So be careful

244
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:51,769
in such situations. Look around before turning appliances on. Okay. Looks like life is actually

245
00:56:51,769 --> 00:57:05,849
painful. Kind of. So I can't like just smash stuff anymore. I can't break anything. How am I, how am

246
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:15,800
I going to be able to do this? Don't break seven objects. I've been just whipping shit around.

247
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:35,500
Oh my God. Okay. Don't break anything. If I haven't broken anything, we're good.

248
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:40,150
I didn't break. What did I break? What did I break? What did I break? What did I break? What did I break?

249
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:57,880
I didn't break anything. What did I break? I didn't break shit. Oh, this vase is everywhere.

250
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:18,710
All right. Put them down. All right. Slowly. Are these bottles of water going to break? No,

251
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:36,679
they made it a plastic, right? All right. I almost have enough. I'm going to back up a little bit.

252
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:46,789
Flashlight energized. All right. The lights are coming on. Thank God.

253
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:13,619
Don't break anything. All right. We're okay. 15 minutes to do this. I can slow down. Why am I

254
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:34,780
going this fast? What turned on the lamp? The lamp. Okay. This is, it's going to shatter.

255
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:56,340
This doesn't count as me breaking something, right? Good. Level two. Not yet. Huh? Really?

256
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:03,449
Go downstairs. See, I see you can't go downstairs. The music's tight. Yeah, the music is really good.

257
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:32,119
The door opened. Oh, I did it. Hold on. Oh, I did. You're right. All right. Don't break anything.

258
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:45,480
Just slowly do it. Oh, don't break it. Don't break it. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

259
01:00:45,480 --> 01:01:27,420
I have 12 minutes. These are pens. A colorful PC. All right. Now, careful, careful. I can lift

260
01:01:27,420 --> 01:02:06,809
shit up now. All right. Okay. It didn't break. Gamer posture. Oh, I'm going to have to tighten

261
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:15,750
myself off. It's starting to, it's starting to hurt. I think it's the way that I'm holding the

262
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:22,070
Wiimote maybe and like going like this and just tensing up a little. It's kind of annoying, but

263
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:27,590
we'll see. I'm all right. I'll tighten it a little bit at the next mission.

264
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:37,429
Jesus Christ. I love elephants. I know. It's great. Okay. Be careful. Here we go.

265
01:02:38,309 --> 01:03:09,380
Somebody in here. I lost control of the stream on that one. Plates. What do I need? 2,500?

266
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:17,349
20 watts do I need? What else is new? I've lost control of the stream.

267
01:03:17,989 --> 01:03:50,920
Eh, it's a typical Saturday then. Here we go. Turn it on. Still not enough. What's, this is for the

268
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:59,909
Wii. What system is it for? It's for the Wii. Oh shit, I can go over there. Wait, can I move this?

269
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:20,150
All right. Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. Slow. TV is now energized. Got a pink one? This is a lot. Oh shit.

270
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:54,579
One sec. He's killing them. Where am I going? I'm just, I'm just tightening the back. What's

271
01:04:54,579 --> 01:05:10,119
he wearing? Here we go. There we are. One more, one more side. Don't hurt yourself playing the game.

272
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:16,760
No, I'm all right. I'm just, this morning too, it was actually, I woke up worse this morning,

273
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:37,050
but I'll be fine. Invite Bugleberry to play with you. No, not giving up. Here we go, that's better.

274
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:42,409
Quick, invite Frog Detector. Where's this TV?

275
01:05:51,420 --> 01:06:04,179
None of this shit is able to be, nothing in here is breakable. It's fine. All right, new door, new

276
01:06:04,179 --> 01:06:15,369
door. I broke something. What did I break? Let Bugleberry play instead. No, if I, if I,

277
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,090
you guys know me, man. If it gets to be too much for me, I'll just, I'll just see you tomorrow.

278
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:39,940
You know that. It's happened once before. Can't break a picture, right? Bugleberry, no, Bugleberry's

279
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:55,929
not gonna play this. He's not even good at this game. That was like angry how hard I threw that.

280
01:06:55,929 --> 01:07:09,460
I picked that up off of my head and fucking just whipped it into the wall. All right,

281
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:17,239
there's another door I can go on. Let's turn this on. All right, don't break that vase, easy.

282
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:49,829
Can I move these yet? Nothing breakable in there, it's fine. Oh shit, they're on the walls. Come on,

283
01:07:52,679 --> 01:08:14,650
do it. Where are the elements? Oh, no, get me back out there. Give me, I just hurt it. Where are they?

284
01:08:14,650 --> 01:09:08,760
Okay. All right, watch out. Toilet, energized. Heater, energized, good. I'm not, I'm not trying,

285
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:20,010
I'm trying to pull it off. Where's the heater? All right, let's do the cookie right in the middle.

286
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,949
Heater, energized. Heater, energized. It's right here, right? There it is.

287
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:34,600
30 seconds, fuck. I'm not, I can't move the boxes yet.

288
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:43,859
You're gonna stop, you're breaking our marriage?

289
01:09:46,710 --> 01:10:25,319
3500 to turn this on, shit. Okay, we're fine now. It's the worst thing to do right now,

290
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:57,510
is like sneeze. He's getting sicker. I'm fine. I sneezed once. I was here because he sneezed.

291
01:10:58,149 --> 01:11:06,859
I still haven't beat the fucking level. No, I'm saying it's bad because like that like detracts

292
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:51,130
my chest muscles and chest and shit. Where is he? Wait, somebody out here. I'm breaking in.

293
01:11:51,770 --> 01:12:15,510
Why is it so hard for me to open a door? I'm done for. I'm gonna lose. Sometimes you gotta

294
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:21,159
crack a few fucking eggs to make your breakfast in the morning, whatever it is. What do you know

295
01:12:21,159 --> 01:12:42,789
what I'm saying? It's gonna be only two of you in here. How did I move the bed? No, move the bed.

296
01:12:42,869 --> 01:13:02,819
How did I move the bed so much? Air purifier. Where? There it is. 30 seconds, shit. I'm gonna

297
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:42,220
lose. I need 3000, right? Turn on. Come on. Come on. Hurry up, please. Where are they? Get out of there.

298
01:13:42,220 --> 01:14:07,460
Where the fuck are, what? I think I lose. Oh, I got it. Thank God. I got it. Hey, I'm from the future.

299
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:13,699
Jerma doesn't do it. Well, you must be from the wrong future. I'll get what I can in 15 seconds.

300
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:32,899
I didn't get to go in the other room. At least I got to go in the bathroom. Wrong timeline.

301
01:14:33,699 --> 01:14:52,329
Jerma, I beat Mario. Are you proud of me? Of course I am. It's a really hard game. Keep touching

302
01:14:52,329 --> 01:15:07,590
your face. Well, I'm like, I know I really shouldn't be doing that, but I've been washing my hands.

303
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:13,029
All right, we get to do the kitchen. I'm gonna do the kitchen mission. Sure, I'll do a tutorial.

304
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:28,170
Quick, you're losing more piss jokes. So, you make noises. You don't want to make too much noise.

305
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:34,409
The volume gauge will fill as you make noise. When a certain line is passed, the count will decrease.

306
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:45,319
Zero is a mission failure. So, don't make noise. Don't let them run around. Okay, I get it. Hey,

307
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:47,319
we got a cut scene.

308
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:11,079
You better take my gun.

309
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:32,600
Gotta go. Be careful with that gun. It was like, the dad was just doing a tuber voice.

310
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:43,829
Okay, be sure when you have that Eliebrits thing, you don't fire it too quickly. I gotta go.

311
01:16:43,829 --> 01:16:58,260
See you in the next episode. That's TTS voice. That is TTS voice. All right, the silent kitchen

312
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:20,279
after 4,000 watts. Oh, I can hold on. I'm gonna save that. It's just bread, man. Why would it take

313
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:27,720
that loud? Why is bread this loud? Oh, I dropped a fucking pot on the ground.

314
01:17:37,939 --> 01:17:58,149
Noise canceler. Eliebrits won't hear noises. Okay, I have an idea. I mean laser. Yeah, here we go.

315
01:17:58,149 --> 01:18:35,779
Oh shit, they can hear noises again. I just, I was passing out and you know when you're passing the

316
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:43,770
fuck out and then you lie down for a second and the world starts to come back? That's just what

317
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:52,180
that felt like. Oh, I have to insert what? Insert coffee. Insert toast. Insert toast in the toaster.

318
01:18:52,899 --> 01:19:59,579
Is it not toast? Where's the coffee maker? Oh, this is gonna be insanely difficult to do this.

319
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:08,920
Got it. All right, I can't get the fucking toast in there. It's gonna take too long.

320
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:20,310
What do I need to put in the oven? Insert what? There's already a turkey in there.

321
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:36,420
TTS.

322
01:20:48,340 --> 01:21:06,250
Put a potato in there? Everybody is the... what? There we go. Come on, get level two.

323
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:18,310
I still can't get this fucking toast in here. Dude, there's no way you're gonna get this toast in

324
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:47,689
there. Cancel all sounds. Okay, throw the pizza fucking everywhere. Break everything. All right,

325
01:21:47,689 --> 01:22:25,960
give me the hoeing missile. I'm gonna beat it right here. What's the goal of this game? Is to

326
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:31,399
capture elli bits and transfer them into energy and then use the energy to open doors in your house

327
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:49,609
and turn your lights back on. Five, four, three, two, one. That felt fucking good.

328
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:55,930
Level three. Don't make noise. All right, what needs to go in here? What do you put in the microwave?

329
01:22:56,890 --> 01:23:03,289
Uh, what goes in the microwave? What kind of food is on the floor? Onion. Uh, apple.

330
01:23:05,289 --> 01:23:39,539
Bread. Metal. No, no, no, stop. Aluminum foil. It's like a front-loading dishwasher. Mustard.

331
01:23:51,079 --> 01:24:21,739
You motherfucker. Open and stay open. Stay open. Oh my fucking god. Stay open. Stay open.

332
01:24:25,369 --> 01:24:30,939
Every microwave does this shit and it's so irritating. This is actually what happens

333
01:24:30,939 --> 01:24:33,180
when you have a real microwave. But this is, this really happens.

334
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:39,899
Stop doing that. Why do they, why does it do that shit? This is not a game problem. This is like,

335
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:55,020
that's a real world problem. Oh fuck, I can't make noise. It's upside down. What the fuck do I put

336
01:24:55,020 --> 01:25:09,529
in here? Bread? What about the turkey? Should I put the turkey in there? How long would it take

337
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:16,069
to microwave a full turkey? Okay, it takes, it takes like four and a half hours to bake a

338
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:40,140
turkey in the oven. If you microwave a turkey from raw, what, how long would it take? I can't

339
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:50,979
move otherwise I'm going to fail the mission. Wait, Mr. Bean did that? Wait, where'd you go?

340
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:57,560
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Wait, Mr. Bean really did that? He microwaved a whole turkey?

341
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:20,890
That's, that's very, very, that's very funny. That's very funny. What should I put in there?

342
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:41,899
I don't want to make any noise. Link the funny turkey video. Don't make any noise. Please just

343
01:26:41,899 --> 01:27:04,340
pick it up. I'm going for a C. Wait, it's real. Oh, it's real. All right, after this, after this

344
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:12,710
level, um, I'm going to watch the Mr. Bean funny turkey video and take a second in the fridge.

345
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:29,609
Oh, shit, is it this? Yeah, we're going to do a react to the Mr. Bean video. Yeah, it's just,

346
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:38,899
it's bothering me. It's actually bothering me. That's why I was wearing it today. 12 minutes.

347
01:27:39,779 --> 01:28:03,640
Preemptive Pog. Movie, movie night! Standing up help? No. Unfortunately. Take a break? Yeah,

348
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:13,340
that, don't, we will. I'm not, I won't push it. This game's fun though, but it's something about

349
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:20,649
this, like, way I'm holding it. I don't know. I had issues this morning. So let's watch the Mr.

350
01:28:20,649 --> 01:28:25,130
Bean fucking turkey video. That sounds like fun to me right now. All right, hold on. Let me get it.

351
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:43,590
Where is it? This looks like it's going to be very funny. This video is 12 minutes.

352
01:28:45,689 --> 01:29:07,829
Thanksgiving Bean. Mr. Bean. Wait, what? This is a 12 minute video. All right, hold on. I'm coming

353
01:29:07,829 --> 01:29:27,140
over here. Plug this in and let's check it out. Bean Crew. Get this on the screen for us to watch.

354
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:44,390
Get it in a browser. Okay, here we go. Mr. Bean. Thanksgiving at Mr. Bean's house. Oh,

355
01:29:44,390 --> 01:30:01,930
are we watching each other on each other's TV? This is nice. There is something we have to talk

356
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:11,960
about. This looks new. I don't quite know how to put this. What I am concerned about is, whoever

357
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:21,159
that is, I am getting rid of them. That's the guy from Ghostbusters 2. There he is. David, sorry

358
01:30:21,159 --> 01:30:31,100
we're late. I love this guy. Terrible. You couldn't believe it. It's just the way she, it's the green.

359
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:39,819
No, it's the yellow. It's just, it's the yellow. Well, where is Allison? Well, I've got some bad

360
01:30:39,819 --> 01:30:47,340
news and some good news. The bad news is that Allison has had to go visit her mom who, well,

361
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:54,220
is not well. That's too bad. Wait, this is from a movie? The good news is that Dr. Bean and I

362
01:30:54,220 --> 01:31:01,579
will be cooking. But he's, that's Dr. Bean? Of course it is. All the greatest chefs in the world

363
01:31:01,579 --> 01:31:12,619
are men. So what's on the menu, maestro? What the hell did you give them? What are we going to do?

364
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,060
Yes, I think they may be expecting something slightly more formal.

365
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:27,289
Hot dog. Just on its own? No, no, don't be ridiculous. It's for Thanksgiving. Allison would

366
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:37,800
kill me. Microwave the raw turkey. There must be something else. One of these before. Why would

367
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:52,779
it take like five hours, right? Not necessarily. No fucking, what? Why? How long did they do this

368
01:31:52,779 --> 01:32:00,699
for? 20 minutes. I don't know. 20 fucking minutes. No, I'm not hungry. You're the chef,

369
01:32:00,699 --> 01:32:07,989
just put on some vegetables. Wait, is the Mr. Bean video game? Holy shit, that's disgusting.

370
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:17,029
Maestro, my taste buds are positively tingling with anticipation. Play the Mr. Bean game.

371
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:26,949
No, no, thanks. I would actually eat those. I would eat those. They look good. I actually

372
01:32:26,949 --> 01:32:35,109
kind of like raw onions. I'm a fucking weirdo. So Bean? Big day Tuesday. Your big day. My big day.

373
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:47,500
I have a question for you. Let's see what it looks like. He's very attentive to detail.

374
01:32:49,109 --> 01:33:12,069
Everything must be just so. What? Is he all right? Is Mr. Bean okay? Bean, I think we need to be

375
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:19,369
honest with each other. I cannot deny that over the last days some suspicions have begun to

376
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:24,789
gather in my mind, and I would just like to ask you some direct questions.

377
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:48,199
Number one, are you a doctor? Okay, I can't do that. Why are you watching Mr. Bean? This is a

378
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:59,220
fake gamer stream. I gotta take a break, man. I'm fucking, I'm in pain. Watch the whole movie. I

379
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:13,460
can't watch this whole movie on stream. I'll get removed from Twitch. Fake react channel.

380
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:23,100
Just watch all the clips in order. No, you can't do that. I can't just watch every scene from Mr.

381
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:29,159
Bean the movie in separate YouTube videos back to back. I mean, that's like, that's skirting the

382
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:33,880
rules a little, and I would probably get some, I'd probably get reprimanded for something like that.

383
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:40,060
Give me, like, give me another Mr. Bean clip. I want to watch like a funny Mr. Bean clip. Any

384
01:34:40,060 --> 01:35:11,380
other funny, like, classic Mr. Bean clips? Okay, here we go. Let's take a look. You got one here?

385
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:18,840
What's this one? Not, that's, that's a, I know, I know, that's a, that's a gnome.

386
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:26,100
Here comes a Bean stream. This is the Crispus Turkey funny clip. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

387
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:30,699
wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. There's more than one Mr. Bean funny,

388
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:48,359
like, Thanksgiving turkey clip? Hold on, there's more than one?

389
01:36:31,659 --> 01:36:35,670
It's just classic Mr. Bean comedy.

390
01:36:44,010 --> 01:37:14,100
Christmas sucks.

391
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:20,729
Merry Christmas.

392
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:38,970
Wait, is he feeding the mouse Christmas cheese? Oh, holy shit, Mr. Bean.

393
01:37:50,699 --> 01:38:18,859
That looks like a fucking folded up person. That's a, that's a human. This is a human.

394
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:31,829
Holy shit, that's a huge fucking turkey. That's a person. Mr. Bean is fucked.

395
01:38:44,979 --> 01:38:46,979
Any more Mr. Bean turkey videos that we haven't seen?

396
01:38:47,859 --> 01:39:04,039
Why is he taking it out? He lost his watch. Oh, he lost his watch in the turkey.

397
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:23,699
I knew it was going to happen. He's fucking a head crap. It's one of those scientists from Half-Life.

398
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:30,119
Holy shit, that's what it would look like if it was in real life. Holy fuck, that's terrifying.

399
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:36,520
Thank you.

400
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,239
All right, any more? I want more Mr. Bean food related videos.

401
01:40:19,829 --> 01:40:34,489
I want, is any other Mr. Bean turkey related videos? Is there another Mr. Bean turkey video?

402
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:48,949
Sandwich? There are hundreds of Mr. Bean turkey related mishap videos.

403
01:40:49,829 --> 01:40:53,859
This one, one last one. This one, this one. Just found it, found it, found it.

404
01:40:55,300 --> 01:41:07,880
That's not it. This is a turkey one. Please watch this one. Should have watched this during Thanksgiving.

405
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,710
You guys are all, Lincoln says random shit. These aren't, these aren't even Mr. Bean.

406
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:31,750
Seafood bean. Mr. Bean, no, no, no, no. This is the one. This is the best one. This one is a French restaurant.

407
01:41:32,229 --> 01:41:41,979
I love this one. No, it's got to be food related. Seafood is the best one. All right.

408
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:51,739
All right, every time some people, half of these. Okay, somebody just linked the scene where

409
01:41:51,739 --> 01:41:57,479
Ace Ventura comes out of the rhino's ass. That has nothing to do with Mr. Bean. That's like,

410
01:41:58,039 --> 01:42:13,460
honest to God, what the fuck are you talking about? Is this it? No, that's not it. That's,

411
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:23,050
that's, that's like a turkey, turkey video. Okay, here we go. Somebody got it. Somebody got it.

412
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:34,789
Somebody got it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Here we go. Oh, you don't know about Sprite, Ginger.

413
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:49,380
What?

414
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:58,390
He lost his voice. It's the same video.

415
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:00,789
He lost his voice.

416
01:43:07,029 --> 01:43:11,430
It's the same fucking thing. It's the same one. I love it.

417
01:43:20,359 --> 01:43:27,350
There's just no laugh track on this one. Now listen, David, I want a straight answer.

418
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:31,109
What do you think about the mayor? Oh, you know, maybe I should just go in and help.

419
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:35,989
No, please sit down. The doctor is in complete control of the situation.

420
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:49,189
You see, the problem with the mayor is that, well, how can I put this kindly? He's a total idiot.

421
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:56,550
This city needs this leadership, vision, vision.

422
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:01,510
No, I don't think you're going to get that from a compromised career politician.

423
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:07,350
Who wants to be in charge of this? Which is why George should be running for office.

424
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:14,149
This is a germist dream. Excuse me. This is a germist dream.

425
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:19,979
It goes all right there. Yes, thanks.

426
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:39,350
Wait, is this the same movie? 20 minutes.

427
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:50,470
Put some vegetables on it. Come and say hello. Wait, is this the same movie? Is this the same one?

428
01:44:59,529 --> 01:45:07,750
You found another turkey one? Is this, is this actually another turkey one? That's not it.

429
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:39,460
The world isn't black and white. There's no set.

430
01:45:40,180 --> 01:46:08,220
Oh, please go on his head. Please go on his head. Go on his head and have him hit walls and shit.

431
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:27,060
Please pinch your soul. Half a dozen oysters. Oh, they forgot to clean this one.

432
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:38,380
What the fuck is he doing? It's a germist dream. A can of peas.

433
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:44,659
It's a germist dream. We just say things that we're doing and then we do the same thing over and

434
01:46:44,659 --> 01:47:01,739
over again. Oh, can of peas. A couple of oysters. A dozen oysters. Can of peas. It's classic humor.

435
01:47:01,739 --> 01:47:19,770
It worked. Oh my god, he's going to get stuck. That's it? That can't be it. What do you mean

436
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:23,590
that's it? There's another classic turkey one.

437
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:52,470
Hello? Phoebe? Joey? What's going on? Get off the screen.

438
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:12,899
Dad, how did you get on? Hunter scared Chandler. Then help me get it off. Plus,

439
01:48:12,899 --> 01:48:18,500
it smells really bad in here. Of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.

440
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:39,500
Okay, this is going to be...

441
01:48:58,579 --> 01:49:17,529
It's going to be the exact same thing. Shit, that was pretty sick.

442
01:49:22,229 --> 01:49:24,710
That was a microwave. What the fuck? You got to do the same thing.

443
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:44,340
Oh. French fries and turkey. But it didn't go on his head. This isn't funny. I don't find this

444
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:59,590
humorous. It's not on his head raw. I swear to god, I fucking promise you, there will be a time,

445
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:07,109
not today, not tomorrow, not next week. I will do a fucking... Look at how funny it is with turkeys

446
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:11,670
on his head. I'm going to stuff a turkey joke. I promise you. What the fuck is going on?

447
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:50,890
Aurora Borealis. Smithers, whatever your fucking name is.

448
01:50:50,890 --> 01:51:07,369
It's supposed to be as funny as the actual turkey joke.

449
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:27,130
He's breathing in the smoke. That wasn't even funny. Yeah, that kind of sucked, to be honest with

450
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:52,979
you. Okay, that's enough turkey videos for now. That's enough. No more turkey. No, no, no more

451
01:51:52,979 --> 01:52:02,859
turkeys. No, I'm not playing the other one. No, this one, I don't want to play this one. No more.

452
01:52:02,859 --> 01:52:06,539
No, he doesn't even do anything funny with this. He's just holding it in his hands.

453
01:52:11,739 --> 01:52:18,520
Watch this, please. Watch this. This is toilet humor, Mr. Bean. No, no, we're not watching Mr.

454
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:40,760
Bean piss it into a urinal. The last one, please. Hold on. Oh, okay, fine. Do people still think

455
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,260
that's fun? How many of you guys, do people still think that that's funny?

456
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:53,670
Oh, the turkey joke. Oh, it's just like a Jerma stream. He does like kind of the same shit every

457
01:52:53,670 --> 01:53:01,189
time. Let's link the streamer, the fucking gnome video every stream. You and I are not so different.

458
01:53:01,989 --> 01:53:08,069
Hey, click this link. It's the, it's the, I think this is funny still. We're not so different,

459
01:53:08,069 --> 01:53:25,539
you and I. Why do I need the lyrics? No, I'm not watching any more turkey videos.

460
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:48,010
That was a good break. Now, what do I want to do now? No, no more chicken videos. Clean your room.

461
01:53:52,069 --> 01:53:56,710
Let me, let me stand up for a second. Let's actually take a just an actual BRB. I want to

462
01:53:56,710 --> 01:54:02,310
stand up and like move around just a little bit. I think I'm going to take the brace off

463
01:54:03,539 --> 01:54:10,659
and just move around a little. Give me one second. I will be right back. I'm going to take this off.

464
01:54:11,619 --> 01:55:40,550
I've moved up and down a little. I don't want to say this, but I'm going to.

465
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:48,500
I'm going to have to call it here. I'm sorry. I got to like, I don't know what I'm going to do,

466
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:56,600
go lie down or something. This is hopefully not going to start happening more frequently

467
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:00,359
because this happened like a few weeks ago where it just like, I couldn't do anything and it was

468
01:56:00,359 --> 01:56:09,289
just uncomfortable. So I'm just going to call it. Not going to push it. I don't want to. Sorry,

469
01:56:09,289 --> 01:56:16,460
we only have like a three and a half hour for probably four hours stream, but we'll be,

470
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:21,340
I'll be back tomorrow. Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day because I'm going to play

471
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:26,380
the game that is on the GameCube. That is a microphone game. I don't know if you want to

472
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:39,500
miss this one. That's a microphone based video game. It is called Oh Dama. You control an army

473
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:48,010
with your voice while you throw a boulder into buildings. It's going to be a little weird,

474
01:56:50,869 --> 01:56:57,000
but sorry. Uh, that the last like probably full hour or so I just was have not been that

475
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,489
comfortable and I really just want to kind of just, unfortunately I have to stop.

476
01:57:03,609 --> 01:57:10,380
It started once I started playing like Elevates. I think this is the way that I was holding and

477
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:18,600
just how I felt earlier today. So I will see you tomorrow. Um, I'll make sure like,

478
01:57:19,319 --> 01:57:25,020
I don't know what to do tomorrow, but I'll try to rest up and make it so I can sit here longer

479
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:27,659
because I was fine. Yes, this is, but I think this is, you know, this is like,

480
01:57:27,659 --> 01:57:32,699
that's so annoying about this. It's like yesterday. I was, I was live for like eight

481
01:57:32,699 --> 01:57:36,539
fucking hours yesterday and I was like, fine. I didn't need the brace and they woke up today

482
01:57:36,539 --> 01:57:40,779
and it was just like, fuck. It like hurts. Put the brace on. It helped a little bit,

483
01:57:40,779 --> 01:57:49,859
but you know what I mean? It's like, come on, man. Like this annoying. We'll see you tomorrow.

484
01:57:49,859 --> 01:57:59,420
We'll do it again tomorrow. I'm going to play Oh Dama. I'll see you then. It'd be the weather.

485
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:12,470
No, I don't think so. I don't think so, but we'll see you tomorrow. Does he know that he needs a

486
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:23,189
mic? Oh, I have a mic. Actually, you know, let me see. Make sure it's in here. Oh, it's in here.

487
01:58:23,189 --> 01:58:44,760
All right. I have to, hold on. Let's actually want to show this. So here is the GameCube Nintendo

488
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:58,170
microphone in the package still. Let's take it out. And apparently this does work in here.

489
01:58:58,170 --> 01:59:09,220
Did I just ruin this by putting my dirty fingers all over? What else can you use this with? I don't

490
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:13,779
know. Apparently it works in the Wii. I know. I'm going to make sure it works before I turn the

491
01:59:13,779 --> 01:59:21,220
stream on. Check the disc. Check the disc. Check the disc. Why does this have to be a thing? Why do

492
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:28,260
I have to like make sure this shit's in here? Here it is. Oh Dama. Oh yeah, it's in there.

493
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:34,890
It looks pretty. This is like a really sleek case too. Live unboxing. Here you go. There it is.

494
01:59:35,529 --> 01:59:41,989
It's a nice case. Take a look in here. It's like a, like a really nice case. It's got the manual too.

495
01:59:43,579 --> 01:59:55,220
Pretty nice case. It looks, this looks big for GameCube game. Doesn't it look kind of big? This is

496
01:59:55,220 --> 02:00:02,470
like, does it look bigger? I don't know. Maybe. But that's the plan tomorrow. Uh, everything's in here,

497
02:00:02,470 --> 02:00:09,270
so that's good. Uh, if you missed the stream today, uh, my body hurt. I got scammed and uh,

498
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:14,789
we watched Mr. Bean stuff his head in a turkey four times. Pretty good Saturday. Pretty good

499
02:00:14,789 --> 02:00:23,880
Saturday stream. I think so. So I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a great rest of your day and we'll

500
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:46,659
see you tomorrow. Thanks for the catch up. Sorry for Rick rolling you. The classic fucking food

501
02:00:46,659 --> 02:00:53,619
mishap video. I love it so much. Take care guys. See you tomorrow. We'll do the bits. I'll hang out

502
02:00:53,619 --> 02:01:07,060
for a little bit. Let's go over here. So earlier we had, uh, we had Spigot the bear for five dollars.

503
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:13,539
Thank you for the 500 bits. Hey Jerma, as a verified 2006 gamer and god skater, do you think you would

504
02:01:13,539 --> 02:01:23,979
ever stream Bully? You do the Wii version for some boomer exercise. Um, I don't know. Aren't they

505
02:01:23,979 --> 02:01:28,140
making another one? Aren't they like remaking it or something? Wouldn't they? I heard they would like

506
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:35,159
redoing it or there was going to be a second one or I'm kind of just waiting on that. Not confirmed.

507
02:01:35,159 --> 02:01:50,220
Oh, they aren't. Oh, it got cancelled. Oh, oh, cancelled. Oh, okay. There's been so many rumors

508
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:58,789
about Bully 2. Yeah, I've played Bully. I played it a long time ago, but maybe let's get through all

509
02:01:58,789 --> 02:02:02,149
this stuff first. I still have a bunch of stuff that I want to play and try on like the Wii and

510
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:08,470
the GameCube. Some classic, some not so classic. Obviously, I still have Eternal Darkness that I

511
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:14,229
want to play, which that's a classic. That's going to be really fun. Uh, both the beautiful Joes,

512
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:24,180
No More Heroes 2. Those still have to come up and be done. When can we expect more Cabelas?

513
02:02:24,899 --> 02:02:31,260
Never. But thanks for the five dollars. Uh, Bulbaswag, thanks for the 500 bits. With the

514
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:38,600
coronavirus, Clown of the Town would have a new risk factor. Clown of the Town is just impossible

515
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:44,119
to do without 500 million dollars. I followed just for Cabelas. Well, I'm sorry. You probably

516
02:02:44,119 --> 02:02:49,800
should unfollow if you followed for Cabelas, because that is the first and only time you will

517
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:57,079
ever see a Cabelas video game streamed on this stream. It's not going to happen probably ever

518
02:02:57,079 --> 02:03:04,760
again unless, unless I get scammed again and somebody puts the wrong disc into a game that

519
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:14,779
I purchased. So if I buy like Raving Rabbids again and there's a Cabelas 2006 disc in there,

520
02:03:15,859 --> 02:03:27,050
sure, got scammed. Well, I keep getting scammed with these used games. And that was live. That

521
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:42,149
was a live, I got fucking scammed. I can't believe it. I'm so annoyed by that. Send him a cabinet.

522
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:49,659
What a sucker. Hello again, mister. Thanks for the 250. Hey Jeremy, I just came back from Portugal

523
02:03:49,659 --> 02:03:53,739
where I got to see my girlfriend for the first time in a while. When I got back I had to go into

524
02:03:53,739 --> 02:03:59,180
quarantine where I'll be for 14 days. Getting back home to your stream made the situation easier to

525
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:09,939
bear. Thank you so much. Hopefully, um, you're good to go. Kind of a scary time right now.

526
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:17,260
Just uncertainty and what exactly this is and what it does. And it is kind of at that point

527
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:25,510
right now. We're, we're trying to ease the amount of infections as much as we can, I guess. So just

528
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:31,670
be careful. Take care of yourselves. Stay, obviously stay clean. Wash your hands. Don't go

529
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:37,189
anywhere. You don't have to go. That has a lot of people there. I mean, this is just basic stuff

530
02:04:37,909 --> 02:04:46,180
unless for a little while, right? Yeah, it's, it's not, it's not a joke.

531
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:58,090
There's no joke. Be careful. Why did you cancel E3? I was looking for what I didn't have. What?

532
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:04,199
I'm a guy that sits in his underwear and watches it and like drinks coffee and like,

533
02:05:05,319 --> 02:05:11,130
I have nothing to do with you. What are you talking about? Hey, uh, Sybeck, thanks for the

534
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:16,329
$15 Sybeck. Here, Jeremy, take some money to never do that fucking woody bit again. Well,

535
02:05:16,409 --> 02:05:21,930
I can't promise that won't happen. Considering how many turkey mishaps you've seen on this stream,

536
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:30,300
I'm sure you'll see it again soon. Thanks for the $15 though. Appreciate it. Hey, smelly boy,

537
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:34,380
thanks for the $2.50. I'm not kidding when I say big game hunter 2005 was the first game I ever

538
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:38,939
played when I was like seven on my PlayStation 2 and it made me so happy when you started playing

539
02:05:38,939 --> 02:05:46,569
it. It made me so happy when you got scammed. Can you imagine sitting here watching a stream

540
02:05:46,569 --> 02:05:50,170
and it's like, Hey, I'm going to play raving rapids. It's like, Oh, okay. I guess that's what

541
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:56,569
he's going to play. And I opened the case and it's holy shit. It's the first game you've ever

542
02:05:56,569 --> 02:06:03,500
played, like tricked you. We're on Egypt and I'm playing Cabela's and it's like, Whoa, that's the

543
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:15,420
first thing I've ever done. That's just weird. Isn't it? That's like a moment for one person.

544
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:27,300
That's the one guy. Thanks for the $2.50 though. Uh, option. I, well, thanks for the $3.47. If

545
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:31,699
Drew crew ever puts you under too much pressure, Jeremy, I can delete German walk and leave them

546
02:06:31,699 --> 02:06:45,819
in shambles. Holy shit. You hold all the power. Oh man. That's a lot of power that you hold.

547
02:06:46,619 --> 02:06:55,989
The nimble pickle. Thanks for the $15. It was my birthday yesterday and I just want to say,

548
02:06:55,989 --> 02:06:59,989
thank you for six plus years of entertainment. Also, when do you plan on playing Viva Pinata

549
02:06:59,989 --> 02:07:06,840
again? It was a great stream and we want more. Um, after this weekend, I would say,

550
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:18,020
so probably I might, we've done a lot of weird game cube stuff. I'll probably go back to the

551
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:27,539
X-Box, but also next week is the animal crossing and I'm playing animal crossing absolutely,

552
02:07:27,539 --> 02:07:33,699
at least around somewhere around when it launches. So what I'll probably end up doing is we'll

553
02:07:33,699 --> 02:07:41,180
probably do some X-Box stuff. Uh, like starting on like Wednesday and then we'll do like Wednesday,

554
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:46,380
Thursday, Friday, Saturday or something. And we'll do a couple of X-Box games and then I'm

555
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:54,329
going to play animal crossing for a couple of days, at least when it comes out. We'll see.

556
02:07:54,329 --> 02:08:09,140
That's the plan. Thank you for the 15 bucks. Wait. Oh, I thought you said, I thought you said animal

557
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:16,140
crossing is not shipping until April. I was like, no way. What really smelly boy. Thanks for the

558
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:20,140
two 50. Thank you. So thank you for playing a big game hunter. Even if it wasn't for long,

559
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:24,619
it was hilarious watching you play. Just listening to the sounds and watching you chase the werewolves

560
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:30,220
Wolverines, uh, gave me such a nostalgia trip and have me laughing so hard. I've been sick

561
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:35,579
the past few days and very afraid because of it. Your streams are always a light in the darkness.

562
02:08:35,579 --> 02:08:49,460
Love you, man. Keep up the good work and let's hope all this stuff passes soon. I agree. I remember

563
02:08:49,460 --> 02:08:52,819
when I first started watching German with a super meat boy, let's play. I was pretty good at that

564
02:08:52,819 --> 02:09:07,720
game. I did all the dark world levels and all the bandage girls level. Thanks smelly boy. Uh,

565
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:11,239
take care of yourself. Hopefully it's nothing serious, right? Hopefully it's not anything

566
02:09:11,239 --> 02:09:23,640
to be concerned about. LM man. Thanks for the 500 bits. Jerma, you are king. Thank you. Uh, 10 Mario

567
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:28,439
or 10 Mari 10. Thanks for the 300 bits. I had a dream that you were streaming some game

568
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,520
when your cam accidentally turned on and you were standing fully nude in the shower.

569
02:09:33,239 --> 02:09:37,000
Jack kept saying TOS and penis, but you didn't notice. I feel like this is an omen.

570
02:09:37,479 --> 02:09:49,220
Um, I've had that dream twice, so trust me, I'm aware of it. Uh, you posted cringe bro. Thanks

571
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:53,060
to the 500 bits. You're losing a quick more piss jokes. I read it earlier, but I thought it was

572
02:09:53,060 --> 02:10:03,479
kind of funny. Uh, you posted cringe bro gave another $25 and they say, Jerma, you're worried

573
02:10:03,479 --> 02:10:11,640
about the Corona virus with you being a boomer cringe and needs to say cringe. Which one of us

574
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:31,979
is posting the cringe? Sure. It's me. Oof. Oof. No, it's me. It's me. Uh, thanks for the 25

575
02:10:31,979 --> 02:10:38,229
fucking dollars in bits though, dude. Seriously. It's Luke can. Thanks for the $5. Jerma, are you

576
02:10:38,229 --> 02:10:50,779
in a quarantine? No, I am not. Let's hope it doesn't get that far. I'm not, uh, future fashion

577
02:10:50,779 --> 02:10:55,979
grow clown. Thanks for the $3 and 20 cents. Jerma, what's your opinion on mustard on hard boiled

578
02:10:55,979 --> 02:11:03,510
eggs? Well, a lot of deviled eggs have mustard inside of the mixture, so I think that that's

579
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:11,029
all right. That's fine. That's good. It could be good. I don't know about directly on a hard boiled

580
02:11:11,029 --> 02:11:20,220
egg, but part of the mixture of a deviled egg. Sure. I'd say so. Espada Escalada. Thanks to the

581
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:34,420
250. Mr. Bean is the bugleberry of the television comedy world. No way. Apollyon Abadon. Thanks to

582
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:38,500
the 500 bits. Can we talk for a second about how Bugleberry is the best character?

583
02:11:39,539 --> 02:11:47,989
I hope you think that. I really do. I really do. And if you have been part of any of the pre-stream

584
02:11:47,989 --> 02:11:59,739
chats over the last few days, you will know why. I really hope you do like him a lot. I hope so.

585
02:11:59,739 --> 02:12:22,039
Okay. Boiky, thanks for the 500 bits. Hope your pain goes away soon, Jerma. Also, fuck the bean

586
02:12:22,039 --> 02:12:26,119
team. What's wrong with you? How could you say something like that? He's a classic comedian.

587
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:33,210
I do too. It's getting to the point where this is actually starting to,

588
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:41,899
I went back to the doctor and I had more tests done and I have like my fucking rheumatoid factor

589
02:12:41,899 --> 02:12:50,069
is high and trying some new stuff and this costochondritis might be, it might not just be

590
02:12:50,069 --> 02:12:55,510
costochondritis. I might have like rheumatoid fucking arthritis or something. It's still,

591
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:59,829
we're just still on the fucking train and I want to get off, you know, I want to like get off the

592
02:12:59,829 --> 02:13:07,979
damn train. So it's just almost, it's like, it's been like almost two fucking years of this shit.

593
02:13:08,699 --> 02:13:11,420
I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me and just start treating the fucking thing.

594
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:21,369
I'm just being totally honest with you. You know, I'm not going to pretend or anything. Like this

595
02:13:21,369 --> 02:13:30,439
is just me talking to you real. Like this is just me, but it just, whatever. Well, it just,

596
02:13:30,439 --> 02:13:34,279
I'm going to keep going until it's figured out and then just treat it and try to get back to normal.

597
02:13:34,279 --> 02:13:50,470
Oh, stop pretending. Stop, stop pretending. Unfortunately, funny streamer memes do not

598
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:58,409
work in the world of potential medical issues. Imagine like going to the doctor and he's just

599
02:13:58,409 --> 02:14:02,970
like, oh, so what are your symptoms? Yeah. I still have like this kind of like spinal, like chest,

600
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:15,590
like core pain. Stop pretending. Okay. Oh, there he is. Jerva talks about the doctor and the doctor

601
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:25,800
has a funny voice. Put the turkey on your head. Here's the Jerva goes to the doctor and the doctor

602
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:32,329
goes, oh, what's wrong with you? Oh, I'm stupid. There's a laugh track with the turkey. Oh, it just

603
02:14:32,329 --> 02:14:45,479
bumped into the wall. Anyways, uh, yeah, I just want to get it taken care of. And the problem is

604
02:14:45,479 --> 02:14:51,960
like the medical, the medical like world just moves so slowly. It's like, okay, so here we're

605
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:59,079
going to do this testing. All right. See you in like two or three weeks. Like, can we just,

606
02:14:59,079 --> 02:15:04,600
can I just come in fucking tomorrow? Like, can I just come in for the next eight straight days

607
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:09,079
and you just do everything you've ever wanted to do to me? Like everything that you could even

608
02:15:09,079 --> 02:15:15,100
imagine. Just do it all. Like, oh, we'll see. Oh, we'll catch back up with you. Uh, in April.

609
02:15:15,979 --> 02:15:26,810
But no, no, no. Can I, can I, can you just like do all this shit now? Like, well, we're going to

610
02:15:26,810 --> 02:15:30,970
give you, we're going to do an MRI. Let's set the MRI up. Oh, this is a thing you're trying to get

611
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:34,890
figured out. Oh, we want to figure this out. Uh, so when are you available in, in, in four and a

612
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:47,159
half weeks? Uh, I guess on Tuesday, the fucking 12th. I just want to bang, bang. Let's go. Let's go.

613
02:15:47,479 --> 02:15:55,939
Let's get it done. So like, well, it's a lot of hurry up and wait. And here's the thing. I also,

614
02:15:55,939 --> 02:16:02,840
I kind of get it too though, because there's a lot of like processing and a lot of trying to,

615
02:16:03,479 --> 02:16:09,479
I've had a bunch of shit done already and we're just bouncing around with these different ideas

616
02:16:09,479 --> 02:16:13,800
of what could be fucking wrong with me. I did like a rheumatoid test and it's high. And it's like,

617
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:22,460
okay, well, what the fuck does that mean? Fringe healthcare, fail country. All right. Jay bum bum

618
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:42,139
7723. I remember you, but I don't want to have the, and this is the problem that I don't want to

619
02:16:42,139 --> 02:16:48,780
have bleed into the live streams. I don't want to have this be a problem for me to bring into the

620
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:52,540
streams. I don't want it to affect the streams. I don't want to have it be a situation where I'm

621
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:57,780
just, this is something I'm complaining about a lot or every stream. I'm like, this is fucking

622
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:06,620
stupid. Fuck this. So I don't want it to be like that. And although this is an annoying problem,

623
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:12,780
it's not, it's not like debilitating to me. It's just there and it's annoying and I'll figure it

624
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:19,340
out. But I don't want it to create this like aura of just negativity around me on the stream

625
02:17:20,299 --> 02:17:26,139
because I want to have fun. And like, and look 98 times out of a hundred, this is not a problem on

626
02:17:26,139 --> 02:17:28,940
screen, but sometimes it comes up and it's just like, okay, what the, what do I do now?

627
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:43,459
Like what, what should I do now? Unfortunately. And I know that it's like, no, don't really like

628
02:17:43,459 --> 02:17:45,860
a lot of you guys are saying like, don't worry about it. That's fine. Like we get it and

629
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:51,299
everything. And I really appreciate that. But remember I want to be here. Like I want to do

630
02:17:51,299 --> 02:17:55,940
this. I want to be live. I want to hang. I want to like laugh and have a fucking good time. You

631
02:17:55,940 --> 02:17:59,540
know what I mean? Like I don't want to be like, it's been three hours and like my back hurts. Bye.

632
02:18:02,569 --> 02:18:14,170
So it's, you know, it's frustrating. I'll be honest with you. It is, but I don't want it to

633
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:18,809
be a thing that's because it's not really that in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of

634
02:18:18,809 --> 02:18:25,159
a deal because it eventually long-term, I'll probably have a solution for it. It's just kind

635
02:18:25,159 --> 02:18:37,379
of short-term is annoying. There you go. Laying it out there, right? What a megalofucking maniac.

636
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:52,010
So we get, we're going to keep walking down the road until, uh, until I actually get the exact

637
02:18:52,010 --> 02:18:58,600
thing that's really wrong. And that's pretty much it. I, I'm probably not going to address it too

638
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:03,399
much more on stream because I also don't want it to turn into a thing where it's like, oh, German

639
02:19:03,399 --> 02:19:07,000
something's wrong with you. Something's wrong with German. Something's wrong with him. Oh man,

640
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,719
it's all right German. There's something wrong with you. You're okay. Well, don't worry. I don't

641
02:19:11,719 --> 02:19:18,899
want it to turn into like a, there's something wrong with German. And, oh no, you know what I mean?

642
02:19:18,899 --> 02:19:25,459
I don't want it to be like that. Something's always been wrong with you. Yeah, but I'm talking

643
02:19:25,459 --> 02:19:44,059
about in a medical sense. There's always something wrong with you, dude. But anyways, that's pretty

644
02:19:44,059 --> 02:19:52,250
much it. I just want to talk to you guys and be realistic and real with you, you know? Sometimes.

645
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:58,469
It's all fun and games until somebody wears a fucking boomer brace. You know what I'm saying?

646
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:03,909
Hey Mitchell, thanks for the 500 bits. Odama more like awesome streamer providing years of

647
02:20:03,909 --> 02:20:21,239
priceless content. Clean Your Room title is just so fucking wrong. Clean Your Room playing Elevates

648
02:20:21,239 --> 02:20:31,850
and Mr. Bean is the thumbnail eating raw turkey. It's all fun and games until somebody puts on a

649
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:42,299
turkey head video. Mr. Bean headcrab edit. Oh, come on. Don't, I gotta watch this.

650
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:08,360
The problem with the mayor is that, well, how can I put this kindly? He's a total idiot.

651
02:21:11,799 --> 02:21:20,790
He needs his leadership, vision, vision, petition.

652
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:30,739
That's quick. That's, that you gotta, you have to remember, keep in mind,

653
02:21:32,229 --> 02:21:35,510
you gotta render this shit. That, it takes a little bit to render.

654
02:21:36,309 --> 02:21:49,530
You have to make this, render it, and upload it. Damn, that's fucking pretty good. All right,

655
02:21:49,530 --> 02:22:07,290
let's keep going with the, with the bits. We have a little bit more. Where'd it go? We had, that was

656
02:22:07,290 --> 02:22:15,940
Mitchell. Thank you for the $5 Mitchell and the video. Hey Lil Din Osor, thanks for the 500 bits.

657
02:22:15,940 --> 02:22:19,700
Hey Jerma, today's my fourth anniversary with my boyfriend and we celebrate it by watching you.

658
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:23,540
We love and appreciate you. Hope all your health stuff gets better soon. Well, I appreciate that.

659
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:34,120
Thank you and happy anniversary. Four years. That's, that's really good. Thanks for the five,

660
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:46,139
that five ducks, five bucks. And I can hear myself talking because this thing is plugged in and it's

661
02:22:46,139 --> 02:22:54,790
speech jamming me. So let me just turn that off. Here we go. That's better. Yeah, I can hear myself

662
02:22:54,790 --> 02:23:03,719
talking to my own ears. Do a speech jammer stream. That wouldn't last very long. I'd throw up.

663
02:23:03,719 --> 02:23:13,590
I could try it. I could try it for fun for like maybe half an hour or something at the end of

664
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:20,739
a stream. But yeah, happy anniversary. Thanks for the $5. Snoozing compter, thanks for the 250. Hey

665
02:23:20,739 --> 02:23:24,899
Jerma, long time no bits. Please don't tell me Elevitz is going to get the God Hand treatment.

666
02:23:24,899 --> 02:23:30,739
We played the beginning as part of a shit storm crack stream and forget about it forever. No,

667
02:23:30,739 --> 02:23:35,860
it was just, it was kind of the catalyst to my pain. It was the way it was. I had to hold the

668
02:23:35,860 --> 02:23:43,610
Wii mode and move it around and just the, I don't know, something about it. By the way, the director

669
02:23:43,610 --> 02:23:49,350
that made Beautiful Joe also made God Hand. I knew you were going to talk about God Hand at

670
02:23:49,350 --> 02:24:01,139
some point. Put it on the list. Jeremy, Jeremy, put it on the list, Albertson. Jeremy, push every

671
02:24:01,139 --> 02:24:16,170
new stream week a day and put it on the list, Albertson985. Play Boom Blocks. I have it. It is

672
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:24,549
there. It's behind me. I will play God Hand. I will play God Hand. I will. It's not today.

673
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:32,329
Not today. Not tomorrow. Also, my girlfriend recently woke me up in the middle of the night

674
02:24:32,329 --> 02:24:38,170
and told me not only is she a germaphobe, but also a germaphobe, she's still jealous.

675
02:24:40,889 --> 02:24:43,610
Take care of your old man body. Wait, let me read this again.

676
02:24:45,049 --> 02:24:50,569
Told me not only is she a germaphobe, but also a germaphobe, but she's still jealous.

677
02:24:51,209 --> 02:24:58,549
And then a ton of laughing. She's jealous of you. She's scared of you. She's scared of you.

678
02:24:59,110 --> 02:25:05,559
Did I finish Super Mario Sunshine? I did. I did. I got to beat the game and I got,

679
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:16,090
what, 71, 72 stars or something? Sticks Renegade, thanks for the 250. I hope this virus doesn't get

680
02:25:16,090 --> 02:25:20,969
to me. If you remember, I take immunosuppressants for Crohn's. There's one case in my city and

681
02:25:20,969 --> 02:25:38,520
20 cases in Rhode Island. Yeah, that's... Just be careful. Just be careful. Stay safe. Yeah.

682
02:25:39,479 --> 02:25:53,350
Just try to be healthy. Try to be aware. That's all you can do. Dark Soul, thanks for the 250.

683
02:25:53,350 --> 02:25:59,030
Here's Drink Bits. Johnny Blue tastes like cigars and assholes. Shout out to my boy,

684
02:25:59,030 --> 02:26:04,309
Nier. Call of Fury War Zone good. Me drunk. Thank you, cutie.

685
02:26:08,649 --> 02:26:19,879
I'm sorry that, I'm sorry that you have an opinion that is not correct. I'm sorry that you feel

686
02:26:21,180 --> 02:26:39,239
wrongly about something. This tastes like cigars and asshole. Well, do you even... Okay,

687
02:26:39,239 --> 02:26:46,860
do you like whiskey? Do you like whiskey? Because if you don't like whiskey, then don't take my

688
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:55,459
recommendations for whiskey, right? That's like, dude, I hate hot sauce. I hate it. I think it's

689
02:26:55,459 --> 02:27:00,100
disgusting. Yeah, you should try Tabasco sauce. Oh, should I? Let me try that. I hate hot sauce.

690
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:05,370
Let me try it. Oh, this tastes like fucking assholes. He likes whiskey. He likes good

691
02:27:05,370 --> 02:27:20,809
whiskey. Johnny Walker Blue is good. It's very, very smooth. It's light. It's whatever. Maybe

692
02:27:20,809 --> 02:27:28,090
you should try poo wine. Oh, fuck. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do this to me.

693
02:27:29,989 --> 02:27:37,030
That was the fucking craziest thing, man. This is a weird stream. What a fucked up stream.

694
02:27:38,659 --> 02:27:45,049
The poo wine thing was so ridiculous and it fucked me up for life. I didn't think I was

695
02:27:45,049 --> 02:27:50,950
ever going to do a stream that was going to fuck me up for life. And here I am, completely corrected.

696
02:27:51,590 --> 02:28:02,979
And it was ridiculous. It was exactly the way that it would look. It was... That person that

697
02:28:02,979 --> 02:28:15,209
said that originally, holy shit, you have messed me up permanently. Hey, Machine Nation, thanks for

698
02:28:15,209 --> 02:28:19,129
the three dollars. Hey, Jerm, I just wanted to point out something. When you played Asura's Wrath,

699
02:28:19,129 --> 02:28:23,530
you mentioned it was highly recommended, and I found it was mentioned nine times in the

700
02:28:23,530 --> 02:28:28,649
recommendation channel. Today, you played Monster Lab, which you also mentioned you got from the

701
02:28:28,649 --> 02:28:34,170
recommendations, and that was only mentioned once. Meanwhile, the game Fury has been recommended 12

702
02:28:34,170 --> 02:28:38,969
times since December 2018. It's not been played at all. Well, that's not accurate. Just want to

703
02:28:38,969 --> 02:28:43,850
put that out there. Well, you've got to get your facts right. I streamed Fury already, a whole stream.

704
02:28:44,809 --> 02:28:51,190
Your facts are incorrect. Make sure you come in here with real facts, because I streamed the

705
02:28:51,190 --> 02:29:02,200
video game Fury already when it came out. I got like 50, 60 percent of the way through the game.

706
02:29:07,930 --> 02:29:16,139
So, I mean, if you're going to come after the king, what's that line? If you're going to come

707
02:29:16,139 --> 02:29:29,459
after the king, make sure you bring sweets and give them to me. Yeah, that's it. That's the line.

708
02:29:31,819 --> 02:29:36,620
By the way, just want to make this really clear. Just because somebody writes something in the

709
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:41,260
recommended channel, even if it's a hundred times, doesn't mean I will ever play it.

710
02:29:42,299 --> 02:29:46,760
The reason why I played Monster Lab is because it was recommended, and I looked at it and I said,

711
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:51,659
hey, this looks like it could be interesting. Everyone's a big fan of Monster Rancher.

712
02:29:52,379 --> 02:29:59,540
It's like a back and forth. You have a monster that you grow and level up, and it turns out when it

713
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:13,989
was actually played, it wasn't really that, like, I wasn't into it, and it had tracing in it. So,

714
02:30:13,989 --> 02:30:25,459
I wasn't going to play it. Play purple plays. But the recommended channel is not about how

715
02:30:25,459 --> 02:30:29,459
many people recommend something. It's about, do I think it's interesting enough for me to want to

716
02:30:29,459 --> 02:30:38,059
stream it? Like, do I want to play it? I mean, that's, it's a recommendation. It's not a demand,

717
02:30:39,739 --> 02:30:55,290
right? But to answer your question, I've already streamed Fury. I did. Come on. Come on. Come on.

718
02:30:55,290 --> 02:31:02,409
I did. When? When the game, like, came out. I'm going to look this up. We're going to stop at

719
02:31:02,409 --> 02:31:11,899
Germa Fury. Is it archived? I think it might be. Maybe it's one of those streams that never got

720
02:31:11,899 --> 02:31:20,819
archived. No, it's not. There's not even a single clip of me playing this game, huh?

721
02:31:32,870 --> 02:31:39,190
I love Fury. I had no idea he streamed it. If you Google Germa Fury, this is the second result,

722
02:31:39,190 --> 02:31:45,659
and it is the Reddit thread asking if I've ever streamed Fury. There's no evidence that it was

723
02:31:45,659 --> 02:31:56,940
ever streamed. That's so funny. No, I did. I did. I swear to God. People were here. I didn't imagine

724
02:31:56,940 --> 02:32:09,879
this. I've actually, I swear. You can't prove it. You did. Yes, I did. It's a lost episode.

725
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:21,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, what's this? What's this? Wait, wait, wait, wait. We got a clip.

726
02:32:21,190 --> 02:32:36,600
Somebody has a clip. Get that back in there. This is me playing Fury, but it's me changing games.

727
02:32:39,379 --> 02:32:55,139
Get in there. What the fuck is this? Come on. There we go. There we go. I was trying to stay

728
02:32:55,139 --> 02:33:03,479
with you. I had no idea. I was your only hope. I told you. You had brought this upon yourself,

729
02:33:03,479 --> 02:33:09,559
stranger. It's real. I told you it was real. Tactical visor activated.

730
02:33:09,559 --> 02:33:16,620
What the fuck am I doing? Oh shit. Tactical visor activated.

731
02:33:18,299 --> 02:33:22,860
Oh, it's Mercy and Soldier 76 combined. Whoa, new hero announced.

732
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:29,239
All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Don't you dare minus two

733
02:33:29,239 --> 02:33:35,319
that. That was an incredibly relevant fucking joke because Overwatch was in beta and it was

734
02:33:35,319 --> 02:33:42,299
the biggest fucking thing in the world. Okay. Sorry. Four years ago, I made a jokey reference

735
02:33:42,299 --> 02:33:49,000
to one of the biggest video game releases in 10 years. It was four years ago. I didn't just say

736
02:33:49,000 --> 02:34:02,950
that last weekend. We used to stream Overwatch and then I just didn't think it was fun anymore.

737
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:14,149
Dude, cringe ages like fine wine. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here.

738
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:21,159
Get out of here. All right. I'll see you guys. Looking into the credits.

739
02:34:21,959 --> 02:34:27,270
Sorry for the four hour stream. Thankfully, it wasn't like a two hour stream because it

740
02:34:27,270 --> 02:34:35,850
really could have been. Could have been. Thanks for watching regardless. We'll see you tomorrow.

741
02:34:36,489 --> 02:34:43,940
I'm going to do the microphone video game and see if we can get three times. Third time's a charm.

742
02:34:44,500 --> 02:34:50,389
It's either third time's a charm or strike three you're out because each microphone video game

743
02:34:50,389 --> 02:34:56,200
we've played has been some of my favorite times on stream. Like I've had a lot of fun with the

744
02:34:56,200 --> 02:35:01,479
microphone games. This could be strike three you're out or it could be third time's a charm.

745
02:35:02,729 --> 02:35:09,290
I know. But I'll see you tomorrow. Here come the credits. We'll do the last couple of bits.

746
02:35:10,090 --> 02:35:16,200
As always, thanks for your subs. This channel sees a lot of money like I say frequently.

747
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:33,510
Thank you everybody. Really appreciate it. We will finish the bits. Here's only a couple left.

748
02:35:34,229 --> 02:35:52,620
Hey, thanks off futz for the 500 bits. The music is off. Off futz says, hi,

749
02:35:52,620 --> 02:35:56,059
Jerma. I hope you're having a good day. Please read the following before you read it out loud.

750
02:35:56,059 --> 02:36:10,840
Oh, okay. Temperature does influence joint pain. It's the barometric pressure. I have

751
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:15,639
rheumatoid arthritis and any major change in temperature really messes me up. Cold,

752
02:36:15,639 --> 02:36:21,079
rainy, humid weather makes my joints, tendons, muscles tight while hot weather ups pain.

753
02:36:21,719 --> 02:36:24,760
That's just me and I'm obviously not your doctor but hope this information helps you find some

754
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:31,930
answers. Because Vegas is really, really dry and I mean obviously it's been cold recently because

755
02:36:31,930 --> 02:36:43,129
it's been the winter time. But when hot weather ups pain, I don't know. Let me, this is very,

756
02:36:43,129 --> 02:36:46,649
very good information and I will take it absolutely. But let me get that like a

757
02:36:46,649 --> 02:36:52,920
confirmation that that's what's really going on. Because that's another thing too with obviously

758
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:57,479
me talking about some of this stuff on stream. I don't want to come here with inaccurate

759
02:36:57,479 --> 02:37:03,159
information and stuff that might not be true. Like, oh guys, I have rheumatoid arthritis. Like,

760
02:37:03,159 --> 02:37:07,479
I don't. Like, I don't, that's not confirmed. I have this. I don't want to have you guys,

761
02:37:07,479 --> 02:37:13,610
I don't want to talk about something that I have when I might not even have it. You know,

762
02:37:13,610 --> 02:37:17,850
I want to be certain and not just like throw out nonsense that it could be not even true.

763
02:37:23,770 --> 02:37:31,989
As much as I talk about it, I don't really want to give you diagnostic stuff. Because I've done

764
02:37:31,989 --> 02:37:37,500
that in the past before and I don't, I just don't really want to do that anymore. I'd like to just

765
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:41,899
keep it just private until I have a certain answer. But on the other side of that coin,

766
02:37:41,899 --> 02:37:45,420
it's like hard to not, because if I'm having like a problem and I have to like stop a stream

767
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:51,579
or something, it's like, well, why are you stopping the stream? It's like, I have this problem and then

768
02:37:51,579 --> 02:37:55,260
I have to talk about it. And you know what I'm saying? It's like a, just try to balance it out

769
02:37:55,260 --> 02:38:10,940
a little bit. That's pretty much it. Let's say health problems. Yeah. And like when I wear,

770
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:14,860
that's like, when I wear like the brace, it's like, I know we, I know a lot of people are

771
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:18,459
fucking around and I do, I think it's funny. I do think it's funny. So you're not like hurting

772
02:38:18,459 --> 02:38:22,620
my feelings when it's like, he's got overalls on. Like, why does he have a backpack on? Like I,

773
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:27,579
that's humorous. It's funny to me. It is. But there are people that actually come in and they're like,

774
02:38:27,579 --> 02:38:35,530
why is he wearing that? Like, is he, was it for? It's like, well, it's his backpack, right? That's

775
02:38:35,530 --> 02:38:43,579
that's it. So, you know, it's, I'm trying to find like a healthy balance as to what it even is.

776
02:38:47,750 --> 02:38:54,860
But goo berry juice. Thanks for the 250. Hey, cool. I love monster lab. So glad you're playing the

777
02:38:54,860 --> 02:39:01,819
oops. Nevermind. Hey, how was rabbits? I love that game itself. Oh, whoops. Scammed. Hey,

778
02:39:01,819 --> 02:39:07,100
well Cabela 2005 was the first game I ever played. Oh, he hates it. Whoa. Okay. I love

779
02:39:07,100 --> 02:39:10,940
alibis. That might be fun. Oh, he just watching Mr. Bean now.

780
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:19,829
Oh, it's so true. It hurts.

781
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:30,309
It's perfect. What a perfect way to end this stream. That's perfect. Oh, I love that guy.

782
02:39:30,309 --> 02:39:44,229
Whoops. Scammed. God damn. It's all good though. Whatever. It's all good. Hey, Bimmy. Thanks Bimmy

783
02:39:44,229 --> 02:39:51,989
for the three dollars, Bimmy. And finally we had three dollars from Ozals, which will take us to

784
02:39:51,989 --> 02:39:58,309
the end of the stream. Thank you Ozals for the three bucks. It's a relevant video. There's a

785
02:39:58,309 --> 02:40:16,520
relevant video here. Turn that poop into wine. Turn that poop into wine. Turn that poop into wine.

786
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:23,799
Turn that poop into wine. On the second coming of Jesus Christ, prove it.

787
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:35,129
Take a poop in front of us. What's that even supposed to mean? Oh, that's Eric Andre's

788
02:40:35,129 --> 02:40:43,610
is fucking hilarious. You should watch more Eric Andre. Well, I can't watch more Eric Andre

789
02:40:43,610 --> 02:40:50,010
because I've seen all Eric Andre. I've seen it all. All of his show, all of his extended

790
02:40:50,090 --> 02:41:08,469
New Year's Eve celebrations. I've seen them all. He's very, very, very funny. Are you going to see

791
02:41:08,469 --> 02:41:21,450
the movie? I hope so. Oh, I hope so. I better. They're about Raid, Raid, Raid Joel, Raid Joel,

792
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:38,600
Raid, Raid Joel. What's Joel doing right now? What's he up to? Grand Theft Auto 3. What the

793
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:47,690
heck? Grand Theft Auto 3. Somebody did an uptime in this stream and I thought it said 20 hours.

794
02:41:48,649 --> 02:41:54,389
Like, holy shit, it's been going for a long fucking time. So I want everybody to remember that.

795
02:41:57,750 --> 02:42:01,510
You know, what's better than this? Besides everything, a burger with a crispy wheel of

796
02:42:01,510 --> 02:42:05,909
cheese on it. Is it weird that I, I, this is an ad, but I wasn't looking and I thought that was

797
02:42:05,909 --> 02:42:12,549
Joel doing like a voice for a second. I was like, wait, this is a, no, it's a Carl's Jr. ad.

798
02:42:13,510 --> 02:42:26,379
All right. I'll see, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a good night. Again, sorry for the ending

799
02:42:26,379 --> 02:42:33,260
of the stream, but you know, you gotta do what you gotta do. See you guys tomorrow. We'll do

800
02:42:33,260 --> 02:43:05,930
it again tomorrow. Good night. Take care. Have a good one.
