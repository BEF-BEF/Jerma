00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:09,619
Hello everybody. How are you? Good afternoon. Scam train level 5. Oh wait,

2
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:13,800
Poland. Can I do it right now? I'm gonna do it right now. I'm gonna change it right now.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:24,839
I forgot to do that. I, yeah. Let me change that right now. Okay. Settings. Uh, okay. Preferences.

4
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:32,490
Okay. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Hype train. There it is. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

5
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:44,409
Hard. Make it really hard. And make it 15 events. Done. Okay. Now it's, now it's very hard to do.

6
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:55,719
I just did it right now. Okay. Good. Now I just made it too hard. And now he's, he's, he's just

7
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:04,439
starting to scam everybody. Oh no. Now we're never gonna get a scam train. All right. But anyways,

8
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:13,819
how you guys doing? Welcome back. Uh, my voice is a little gone today. And I just figured out why.

9
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:21,420
And I remember the exact moment from yesterday that it happened. Um, if you remember during a

10
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,060
portion of the stream yesterday, I did this thing where I screamed without screaming.

11
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,000
I screamed very loudly, but I didn't scream. I cut it off halfway through and then I came back

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,980
and screamed louder. Um, that's what did it. And that's why I sound like this today and last night

13
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:48,459
too. Oh, there's only a limited time to earn. There's only a limited time to earn exclusive

14
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:56,120
e-boats. How hard is it now? Isn't it? It's harder to do this. I made this harder to do.

15
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:06,200
And I increased the amount of events that it takes. Everybody get your hands in the air.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:16,460
Everybody, everybody hands in the air. Hands up. Everybody here comes up. I'm just a Skype train.

17
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:25,080
Like we're all going to get on Skype. Level one completed. Excellent work everybody. You did it.

18
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:34,310
You got us to level one Skype train. Is it actually harder to do though?

19
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,300
You're going to have to increase it a little more. What do we got? Hold on.

20
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:46,889
Hype conductors. Hold on. Here are your current hype train conductors.

21
00:02:47,849 --> 00:03:05,509
You boy, pity. This is pay to win. Look at that. That greedy grinner is definitely grinning right

22
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:10,469
now. But we're going to do a community content night. And I know I say night, but it's day.

23
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,069
But that sounds like shit. Community content night rolls off the tongue better than community

24
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:22,979
content day. Oh, community content day. Now community content night. That sounds better to me.

25
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,580
Oh, I don't care if it's 11 o'clock in the morning. It's going to be called community

26
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:35,939
content night or let's call it EU night. But because we didn't do one last month,

27
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:45,300
I had to break it up because I didn't want to get sort of community content exhaustion.

28
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,379
And I'd want to spend time on people's submissions. I want to look at them and talk

29
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:55,699
about them. And obviously I have enough time on them. I don't want to just dump like 500

30
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,860
images on the screen and go, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So we're going to do,

31
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:07,960
we're going to break it up into two. We're going to do two, one right now, and then one next weekend,

32
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,719
which the one next weekend will catch us up over the last like 25 days or so, 30 days.

33
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:22,410
What you're seeing here is stuff from November, from November into December. And there's some good

34
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:37,240
shit here. I've seen, oh, we got a hype train level two completed. Where's my lip balm? I don't

35
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:48,629
even have any lip balm up here. What a mistake. It never gets old. I pray, but on the lipstick.

36
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:55,300
No, I need lip balm. I really do. If I don't have lip balm, then get hype, get hype, hype.

37
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:06,040
It's just that it's the bar. I figured it out. If anytime that there is a completable bar,

38
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:15,000
somebody will do it. Always. It doesn't matter what it is. As long as there is a progress bar,

39
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,129
it's going to be filled. But I see this. I'm thinking about just contributing to make the

40
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:34,730
progress go up. I have to see the bar go up. We're just a bunch of mice. We're just a bunch of rats.

41
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:55,560
Like, bar go up. Yeah, eat. You owe Lord of the Rings subs. Oh, fuck. I actually do. I actually

42
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:04,970
do. I actually really do. Oh, how many? Look, I don't even remember. I remember like 15 minutes

43
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:14,459
of that 13 hour stream. How many subs do I owe? It was 40. Okay. All right. All right. All right.

44
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:20,699
Hey, I got to make this progress go up. All right. Hold on. Hold on. No, that's true. That is

45
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:38,600
absolutely true. Hold on a second. Yeah, because I said if I swung one time that I owed 10 subs and

46
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:45,100
I swung like three or four times. All right. Okay. Well, here we go. Let me gift subs.

47
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:55,300
Give gift subscriptions. Give. Can I give more? Okay. I have to do. All right. Here we go. 40.

48
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:11,420
$200. Now, here we go. Here comes 40 community subs. Okay. My mother does this thing. It doesn't

49
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:18,459
matter how inexpensive or how expensive something is. When she hears the price for it, she repeats

50
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:26,250
the price shocked and annoyed. How much is that? How much is that slice of pizza? Well, it's, um,

51
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:36,810
it's $2.80. $2.80. Jeremy. Yeah, it is. Oh, my goodness. That better be the best pizza I've ever

52
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:48,870
had in my life. Same reaction. If that pizza was $200 a slice, it would be the same reaction.

53
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:59,209
All right. Let me let's do this. Here we go. 40 community subs. I am a man of my word sometimes.

54
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:11,939
I'm making my own hype train go up. Wait, that doesn't count. Hey, hey, that doesn't. How come

55
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:19,819
that doesn't count? I can't increase my own. Hold on. So you can't just sit there and make your own

56
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:33,289
hype train go up. Oh, maybe you should try it again. Should I try it again? Wait, I ran out

57
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,769
of time. No, I didn't. There's still three minutes and 40 seconds left. All right. Let's get this

58
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,690
started. Community content night. Uh, this is going to be short stream. Probably going to be

59
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,480
a couple hours, few hours. It's going to be a quick one. We're just going to chill,

60
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,299
go over some videos, go over some artwork. And I do have something to tell you though,

61
00:08:55,299 --> 00:09:00,980
something that you'll like. But for those of you that, uh, well, for those of you that think that

62
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,259
when Joel is on a stream, it's the worst stream ever. Uh, apparently, you know, the two streams

63
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,820
that we've done together, uh, the first one was nominated for worst stream of the year. Uh, and

64
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,940
the second one was nominated for best stream of the year because I nominated it for this year

65
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:22,649
because I loved it. Tuesday on Tuesday, we're going to do keep talking. Nobody explodes this

66
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:28,950
time. We're going to switch off. We're going to do a little longer this time and we'll switch off.

67
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:41,139
Uh, keep talking and nobody explodes part two on Tuesday. Just got the confirmation. Jesus Christ.

68
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:51,059
Hype train has been completed because, uh, not to be, uh, over not to be overshadowed by my 40

69
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:57,620
community subs, but it's just me. That's all right. Here's the, hold on. All right. Listen,

70
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:06,360
50 community subs just came in from Zyxia. 50. All right. That's right. That's five zero,

71
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,279
50 fucking subs. Everybody, every concurrent viewer is potentially going to be subscribed

72
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,070
to this channel. It's at some point, if you stick around for long enough and you do, and you come

73
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:23,110
to most streams, you're going to get a subscription. If this shit just is, this is out of control,

74
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:32,759
right? Like I mean, mathematically, how much longer can they be like two to 300 community

75
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:43,480
subs every stream? Like, see, you know, I see them saying to say, this is a 69, 69 subs from

76
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:56,629
phylactery. Jesus, guys. Oh my God. And they give the, they give the 69 number every time.

77
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:02,039
Level five completely gets over. We did it and I made it harder. All right. I'm going to make

78
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:12,120
this impossible next time. I guess I could just like, I guess I could just like turn it off.

79
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:23,220
Right. Anyways, but, but that's huge fucking money from both you guys. Thanks for the 50 Zyxia

80
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:30,600
and 69 community subs from phylactery. But what I was saying is all, whenever,

81
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,679
whatever somebody, whatever a streamer gives community subs to their own stream,

82
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:43,820
they're just deleting a percentage of money. You know what I mean? It's just like, here you go guys.

83
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:53,620
Here's 50 community subs. I just, I just deleted money. It's just gone. That's like, that's like,

84
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,299
that's like throwing like pennies away. You know what I mean? Like don't do that. Don't, don't throw

85
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:13,659
like a nickel in the trash. What the hell are you doing? You're crashing the economy. You're just

86
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,899
paying Twitch. Yeah. I just said that paying Twitch money was throwing money in the trash.

87
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,169
Oh, that was probably not the best choice of words.

88
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:37,059
Ladies and gentlemen, twitch.tv. If you want to hang out and have fun, remember I'm a streamer

89
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:42,740
here. I love this. This is a great platform to exist and you know, it's everything and it's also

90
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,570
nothing. Twitch, hang up for a while. That's all right. I just did that. I'm fine. I literally

91
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:58,659
absolved from all crimes at this point. Yeah, I did. I'm good. Anyways, all right. Let's get

92
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:03,700
started. We're going to play Stardew Valley OST. We're going to go over community content art.

93
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:22,860
So why don't we do that? Isn't it beautiful? Let's get it on screen. I'm going to just start with

94
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:30,889
artwork first. That's what we've been doing. This is the third time we've done it. I'm in the wrong

95
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:42,539
position. This is probably not the best music for the image that's completely, that's on the screen

96
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:51,610
right now. Is that guy naked? All right. That was, that was a good one. Oh, Stardew Valley.

97
00:13:51,610 --> 00:14:08,259
Here's Saturn eating his children. Okay. What do you mean bottom right? You just freaked me the

98
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:13,429
fuck out. I thought there was something on this image that I didn't see. Don't shout this person

99
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:19,500
out. Why? I mean, it's down in the corner. All right, coming up. This is another doodles from

100
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,200
Core Monster. Please, if you submit art or anything, get your, get your, get your shit on the

101
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,240
bottom. You know what I mean? So we can know. So it's not just me. So it's not just me sitting in a

102
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:40,809
chair, taking what you've created and going, yeah, that's, that's good. Me. Nice. Hey, we succeeded on

103
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:59,080
the, I'm okay. Thanks for the, uh, 238 subs and the 7,200 and fucking like a hundred dollars in this.

104
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:09,539
Here come the emails. Free Skype account. Anyways, this is cool. Uh, this is, looks like some doodles,

105
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:20,740
which are always cute and interesting. It's literally $700. I know it's a lot of money.

106
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:33,820
I just want, I know it's a lot. There's plans though for that money going directly in a circle.

107
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,139
And it is just wandering because I'm just going to put it back into, into the Twitch stream.

108
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:47,590
Oh, it is going to Twitch, right? So if I get a hundred dollars and I put like $80 back into the

109
00:15:47,590 --> 00:16:02,649
stream. Fuck! Here's another one from Cora Monster. Stalks her in a tumble. Ah, Cora, this is the

110
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:10,169
number one, Bia? Is this supposed to be the first Bia? Oh wait, no, that's Bugleberry. Is it Bugleberry?

111
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:26,570
Oh, is that Bugleberry's urns? I don't even know my own lore. Bia-berry. Bullshit. I wish I could do

112
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:36,230
even 5% of this, by the way. If I could even do 10% of just doodles like this, I, this is,

113
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,379
I would have drawn the like tiger eating the guy dream. You know what I mean? I would draw

114
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:49,019
so much shit. I would, there was so many random creatures and monsters up here that I just,

115
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:54,220
I would be drawing. I wish I could. No, I can't. I cannot learn. I cannot learn. It's no one. No,

116
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,980
I cannot. No, I cannot. I went to school for this. I paid money to an institution to learn how to do

117
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:16,250
this and I'm un, not teachable. I learned. I'm just too, I hold a pen, I hold a pencil like this,

118
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:26,250
guys. You know, I, I can't learn how to draw. I can't do it. And I know my limitations and my

119
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:34,299
limitations are, okay, here we are. This is what I'm incapable of as a person. Funny voices, noises.

120
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:43,900
That's it. That's all I'm gonna do. You know, we've got like noises. For instance, like you've

121
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,630
probably never heard anybody be able to go like this before. Like who can, who can do that that

122
00:17:48,630 --> 00:18:03,220
you know? How about this one? How about that? I never get embarrassed on stream, but that just

123
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:09,910
did it for me. I don't know why. Cause I saw the, I can see the preview over here. You got, see the

124
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:18,809
chat is right here, right there. You guys are right there on this monitor. And then my webcam

125
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:25,750
and my preview is right there. So I look over at what you guys are saying and then I, who's that

126
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:29,990
fucking weirdo? You know what I mean? Like for instance, I'm looking at you guys right now.

127
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,430
Who's this guy? And I fucking don't like him. I can't put, this is why I don't do webcam.

128
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:42,390
Like I'm too distractible. I'm distracted by my own face. This is what happens to me in the mirror.

129
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,720
I'm not kidding. When I get out of the shower, I'm just like, I'm like, what are those, what are

130
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:55,529
those fishes that if they see themselves in a mirror, they get like angry? What is it called?

131
00:18:56,089 --> 00:19:14,569
The beta. You know, if like your cat sees itself in the mirror and it's just like,

132
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:38,579
like that's what I, that's what I do every day. I'm like an animal that sees another like animal

133
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:52,900
in the mirror and thinks it's another animal, but it's just me. I just greased up. I told you,

134
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,619
I'm not lying. I told you guys didn't think I was mad at a sludge. You guys didn't think I was made

135
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:03,910
at a fucking sludge. Nobody believes me. Nobody believes me. Do you believe me now? Do you believe

136
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:13,000
me now? You believe me now, huh? What's he talking about? He said like he keeps slipping

137
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,039
his finger off off the A button when he's playing this game. Oh, I just touched this and slimed you

138
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:30,980
guys community content, but we celebrate all the wonderful things that people in this community

139
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:40,470
create talking about you. We're not talking about Jeremy being a cat or fish or a dog that sees

140
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:52,539
itself in the mirror and thinks it's another dog and freaks out. Um, very good work. Very good

141
00:20:52,539 --> 00:21:05,380
stuff. These are a couple of thumbnails from the second channel. Might as well show them. They're

142
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:13,589
fantastic. Although do they have it in there? I think these are all by the same artist, by the way.

143
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:25,539
I love this. This image is fantastic. I think this is actually from the game itself. That's so good.

144
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:40,069
I know it is. It's so good. God, don't you like wish you were Spider-Man sometimes? I love how

145
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:51,619
it's just done. I love how just done with me Spider-Man is in these images. This is like what

146
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:59,460
it's like when you live in a city and somebody comes to visit and you take them around for a

147
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:12,059
tour. And this may have been like the like the 500th person that has done this and they're like,

148
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:24,230
and you're like, yeah, I've trained. This shit is real. This is this everything. It's all connected.

149
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,500
All connected. We need variety. We need different things to happen.

150
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:38,309
Me too. I'm talking about like the same thing happens. Those of you that weren't here. I'm

151
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:43,910
talking about the Han Solo wires in the ride at Disneyland. Some of you might not remember

152
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:50,180
this and maybe you weren't here, but I can't even explain it. Anybody get anything I'm saying? I

153
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:56,549
gotta be very clear. Does anybody get this? I mean even like three people. Does anybody get this?

154
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:04,890
Nobody can remember this? This is like the same thing as the Han Solo ride 50 times in a row.

155
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:20,599
Because I mean I need to like review this VOD and like bring it to the doctor. Hey, oh yeah,

156
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,670
it's like I got my physical covered up. Doc, what do you think about this? Can you just like go over

157
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:31,589
this footage for a little while with me? Can you just watch this VOD and then like then help me

158
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:52,569
here? This is a dream you had. This is from VR. It's multi trip. Nice work. I have this.

159
00:23:53,769 --> 00:24:01,670
Yeah, this is the acid sludge. My body's just made out of it. Isn't there a superhero or a

160
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:12,170
supervillain or something that has like acid like ability? Probably me. Remember this manga sucks.

161
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:19,400
This is a fantastic image. How dare you say something so ridiculous? This is fucking awesome.

162
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:33,799
Oh, you're referring to the story. The story. I get it. This is great work, Bill. Here are some

163
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:38,920
doodles of the rat movie characters. Getting a little closer actually so you can see it better.

164
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,039
We've got, I don't think about this game. I don't know who these characters are

165
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,079
in the game. Like their actual names. They actually, the characters in 3D Movie Maker

166
00:24:49,079 --> 00:25:00,250
have real names and they're wild. I used to know them all. Like Dick Dastardly Richard,

167
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:05,210
that's his name in the game is not that. It's like, it's like Gregory. I'm like,

168
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:12,900
we need that lore. Well, his name is Dick Dastardly Richard. Well, it's been amended, sure.

169
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,980
No, no, no. I'm saying like not in the lore, this character's name is not Gregory. His name is

170
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:37,450
Richard. The actor's name. Yes. But I like, I like this one. I like this one. I love the super

171
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:49,940
expressive artwork that people do. Although, it would be credited as Gregory. I like cartoon,

172
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:57,849
almost Looney Tunes style of overexpression in style. I love it. I wish I was capable of it.

173
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:09,240
That was a rumor, yeah. Let's zoom back out. Here are some more doodles. Get it all.

174
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:24,819
Get it all. Is that mustache hair? I can't help it. This is just how I look. You know what I mean?

175
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,650
Like, if you tell me to smile for a camera, like I just have like a goblin face. Like I can't help

176
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:42,549
it. I can't help that. I've tried. I, cause I can't smile. Smiling normally for me is just like,

177
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:52,470
I can't, I just, I can't do it. Like in a picture, me going like, no, I can't do it. I feel like too

178
00:26:52,470 --> 00:27:01,259
fucked up trying to do it. Like, no, I can't. I feel like I'm just, I'm pretending. So I always

179
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:11,049
just do this in a picture. I always just go like, which that's fine. I can't do a big wide animated

180
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:16,170
like smile because I just feel like, cause every time the picture is taken, like for instance,

181
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:28,779
like take it, take the picture. Like, like I'm the fucking psycho in that image. That there's not a

182
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:46,410
good look reaction. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'm doing it now. Like that cartoon villain. Oh, this is

183
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:52,220
great though. I like this. I like the, you got a lot of the, you got a lot of the nuances here.

184
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:58,170
This is over here. This is over here. Very good. But do we already have it?

185
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:15,819
Hold on. You already got it. Right. Okay. So hear me out on this. So this image, this image

186
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:32,170
is, that's how I look in pictures. Like that's the, that's the type of image where like you're,

187
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:37,609
you're on like vacation somewhere and the person's taking the photo. There's like three or four of

188
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:43,609
you in this photo. I'm one of them. And that's the face you make while the deep in the distance,

189
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:49,049
you're smiling and like the volcano back there is erupting. And you, that's you, that's the in

190
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:56,410
between from, I'm smiling and happy to, there's a disaster over there. And it's boom, right there,

191
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:09,509
right at that moment. I'm like that in every photo. Ask Kim. When we go out and we're like,

192
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:14,869
oh, let's take a, let's take like a selfie together. Kim will take a photo and it's just like,

193
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,950
she's like, no, no, no, not that one. Let's do it again. And I'm like, okay.

194
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,609
No, no, no, that one's no, no, no, you can't. And then I'm like, all right, let's, let me do it.

195
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:28,250
Let me do it. And I take, I take the photo and I'm just, I take the camera and I'm like,

196
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,329
I try to get it in the right spot. I took for me to take the photo because I know when I'm

197
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:41,660
going to press the button. Right. And then I just do, I end up doing this. That's real life. Go to

198
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:55,529
every picture I've ever been in. I, that face every time. Just telling you facts here. I put it all on

199
00:29:55,529 --> 00:30:05,880
the table. You know, what do I care? Thermal bloat. All right. We can, let's get back to community

200
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:18,519
content. God's sake. What an egomaniac. Egomaniac is like airing out his insecurities. Isn't that

201
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,970
like the opposite of an egomaniac? Oh, what an egomaniac. He's like telling us about his insecurities

202
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:35,380
and he's like, he's showing us his real side. It is. Is it? Hold on. If I tell you, hey, I don't,

203
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,460
I don't like the way that I look in photos. I do the same thing in photos. I look, I don't like the

204
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:47,220
way I look strange. Wouldn't an egomaniac be like, I look good in every fucking picture. I am so

205
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,579
handsome. I'm the most handsome person that you've ever met. Isn't that what egomaniac is?

206
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:20,339
You're talking about yourself. We've seen this. We saw this before. It's stuck into the last one.

207
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:34,779
Look at that big brain up there. Look at this huge brain that's up there.

208
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:56,220
So bad. So bad. Idiot. Bald. Oh my God. Malding. Sour Please. Bold. A YouTube link. Now that's

209
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:03,579
completely accurate. It's just a YouTube link. Steve, follow me. LOL. What's going on?

210
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:20,779
This is fantastic. This is by SnoozingCopter. What's going on in this stream? Idiot. Bald. Bald.

211
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:28,980
No, this is good shit. I love this. Even got this. I mean, typically the camera would be this way,

212
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:41,690
but even got the foam to work. Oh, I sort of flipped this, but just go like this.

213
00:32:43,640 --> 00:33:13,400
But actually I can do it right now. That's too much. Not quite wrong. Can you tell I'm new

214
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:32,059
at this? It's good. Actually, I actually like it like this. I think it's better like this because

215
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:36,779
the wine is pouring upside down. The wine is now the number one thing that you want to look at in

216
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:43,420
the image. You know what I'm saying? And then this is like his arm flowing down. I actually

217
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:57,990
like it like this. I'm serious. Wine actually is the front and center. Why are you drinking

218
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:12,260
wine out of a beer glass? This is completely judgment free zone here because I drink whatever

219
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,940
I want to drink out of any cup that I can get. Oh, you have to drink wine out of a wine glass. Why?

220
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:27,139
Why can't I drink wine out of a Pac-Man cup? Who cares? It's just a cup. It just holds the

221
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:39,429
thing that you then put in your stomach. Who cares? Because why? So you guys can look good

222
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:51,670
in a picture? I don't care about that shit. You know, I don't fucking care. This is great,

223
00:34:51,670 --> 00:35:05,050
though. Seriously, thank you. I'm on a carnival. I got a good Clint Eastwood face going here.

224
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:16,650
This is the Wailord. Wailord is currently downstairs. Wailord has become another bed

225
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:23,579
for Otto to sleep on. Otto has been climbing on top of it and just laying on it and getting

226
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:37,460
comfortable on it. Wailord is now Otto bed number three or four. Get a picture of that?

227
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:45,559
Okay, I'll tell Kim the next time that she sees him doing it. Here's the thing. My camera sucks.

228
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,760
I hate taking photos with my iPhone because the camera looks like somebody spit on the lens.

229
00:35:53,019 --> 00:36:04,280
Get a real phone. I want, no, I'm waiting until somebody releases a small phone. I want the SE,

230
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:09,320
but Apple decided that they were going to just kill the SE, not sell it anymore,

231
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:16,519
and make every phone three times bigger. I don't want a big phone. I want a small,

232
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:25,659
very easy to hold, thin, small phone. I don't want huge phones. I just looked over here and got

233
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:42,139
scared. Like, it just freaks me the fuck out for a second. Here, this is on the other monitor right

234
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:51,880
now. Get that off. I want a small phone. Carnival was one of the most fun times I ever had on stream,

235
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,579
and I loved it, and I'm happy that people thought it was fun. There's another image.

236
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:11,079
Well, we're doing community content tonight. Derma of the future. Derma of the past is probably

237
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:27,369
more accurate. Derma of the past. Gotta be young again. Derma of the future. Derma of the future

238
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:34,059
is gonna be walking around with a cane. Just like, I'm gonna be leaned over, hunched over.

239
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:42,380
Yeah, make this Derma of the, race that to make a Derma of the past, and to get swole again. I don't

240
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:50,230
think I could ever do it again, and look at this shirt. I used to wear those tank tops. I still do.

241
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:04,630
Gym stream. No, I understand now why you drive by all those old people, old ladies and old men,

242
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,469
that are just going like this when they walk down on the street. They just go for a walk,

243
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:10,630
and you're like, what are they doing on there? And they're just going like this.

244
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:18,840
I never understood why they were doing this. I didn't get it. Like, why are you doing that?

245
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,960
But you did, you're just, they're just moving around. They're just getting their arms and

246
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,239
their muscles and their blood flowing, and then they go home. That's what I'm gonna do.

247
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:45,909
I aspire to be that now. Rue crew in public. No, that's, what? Oh, okay, I get it. I get it.

248
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:52,059
That's, but this is good. Thank you. It's good shit. That's how I used to look. Man, I was

249
00:38:55,989 --> 00:39:12,579
riding cheesy. Riding cheesy from Ike. Thank you, Ike. I like the nose. Very cute. Riding cheesy.

250
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:22,440
No helmet. Well, we don't know, we don't know that he's operating the vehicle.

251
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:29,179
He could be sitting still. He could be at a parking lot. We don't know that this is being

252
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:40,039
operated. By the way, it's not real. This is not really happening. Wait, somebody get a helmet on

253
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:57,860
him. This is an image of a cartoon character. What? This is actually pretty interesting

254
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:05,940
considering you go, oh, was that just the giant rat? Well, it is. But from the post, this person

255
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:16,230
has imported the giant rat into Source Filmmaker. And I have the link for that right here. This

256
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:22,869
apparently is the Source Filmmaker files for the, that giant rat. I don't know how you,

257
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:32,710
I don't even know how that was impossible. So I wonder how you did that. He must have had to

258
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:44,059
just model it, right? And then import it in. Rat movie three in Source Filmmaker. I just ripped

259
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:52,139
the model and ported it into Blender and ported it. That's fucking cool. That's awesome. I didn't

260
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:55,739
even know that, I thought they were made out of like bitmap images. I didn't even know it was real

261
00:40:55,739 --> 00:41:00,940
3D. I thought it was just like fake 3D or something. That's, I guess it can kind of have to be,

262
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:11,139
right? I thought it was just like bitmap. Fake 3D. Yeah, like remember like Mario RPG? That wasn't

263
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:18,820
real 3D. It was just fake 3D. It was sprites. Yeah. Yeah, like a sprite image or something.

264
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:24,380
Well, look at like polygons. Like I didn't know they actually had like modeled polygons or

265
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:35,190
something. I don't know. 2.5D isometric view. Like Mario 64. I guess Mario 64 is 3D. I understand

266
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:52,309
you, Jerma. Okay, good. All 3D is polygons. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. 5G Jerma. I'm making a new

267
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:59,980
emote. It's going to be Jerma 5G. And it's going to be that image that I just took of me smiling

268
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:14,739
with like scan lines on it. You know, like, huh? But I don't fucking know what's going on.

269
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:24,710
I think this is used to support. That's really awesome though. I know it's the same exact face

270
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:33,739
because that's what I know. Screenshot that one. All right, coming up next we have. Oh, this is big.

271
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:44,199
This is a big boy here. Jerma95 gumball eyes. $4.20. I think we've seen this image before,

272
00:42:44,199 --> 00:43:02,519
but not on a community content night. So I love that emote so much. It just, it conveys so many

273
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:11,719
different emotions for me. It really does. I love it. Worst emote. No, worst emote is JermaTV.

274
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:20,380
And weirdly enough, I don't want to delete JermaTV because it's, it's, it's just, I don't,

275
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,380
you can't delete an emote. You know what I'm saying? Otherwise somebody will be very, very,

276
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:32,250
very mad about that. If you delete an emote, people, there'll be somebody, I'll get a letter

277
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:39,210
and it'll be like, Jerma, why did you delete JermaTV? I mean, there was a JermaTV community

278
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:48,920
where we did that and we used it. And I'm going to be like, and then I'm going to have to put it,

279
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,119
but I don't want to, you know, you can never delete something. You can only add stuff. And

280
00:43:52,119 --> 00:44:00,150
especially considering, well, your vault, vault coin is going to get deleted. And this face is

281
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,829
going to get deleted too, because there already is one here. You know, there's going to be two of

282
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:10,170
those. So that's getting deleted. But you can't, I just don't want to delete that many emotes.

283
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:16,250
I deleted next. Yeah, I deleted next because it turned into one of the most spammable things

284
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:25,239
ever. And you could, people were just saying next on every single thing that was on the screen.

285
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,880
I would look over and it doesn't matter what it was. It was just like, next, next, next.

286
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,800
It took over the entire chat. So I was like, I got it. I have to get rid of this. What a mistake.

287
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,239
This wasn't for me to add this. I have to get rid of this.

288
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:48,500
Those are the old times. Some old things need to go away. You know what I'm saying? Like,

289
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,500
German next. It was only around for like two months. It wasn't like it's been here for like

290
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,659
five years. It was here for like two months tops. And then I was like, I can't do it anymore.

291
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:22,809
That's true. I know, I know. Here's another, uh, doodleishito. I'm not even, what is this?

292
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:38,039
Is this a cigar? I thought I'm drinking coffee. Am I drinking coffee through the cigar? Is that

293
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:50,409
what we're supposed to be implied? No, it's just, it's just here. Imagine you had a chin

294
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:58,280
that fucking big. I feel like it would be a problem. How many of you guys lie in bed like this?

295
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:04,710
Like even if my chin was like an, I got a big chin. I do. I have a very large chin area,

296
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:10,550
like frontal chin. If this was even another half an inch down like this, an inch down,

297
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,099
when I lie down in bed and I hold like I'm on my phone or I have like my iPad or I'm just lying

298
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:22,010
there, you know, you go like this. It would be, you'd make a mark here. You know what I mean?

299
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:26,409
Like it would just, if you have a big, huge chin, you'd be pressing it down like into your neck.

300
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,530
You would just like hit your trachea and you'd be like,

301
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,130
uh, you couldn't put your neck down.

302
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:47,320
Anyways, this is good. This is my first time drawing Jerma. Oh, it looks great. What did you

303
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:56,550
do this with? Uh, we sit in them here. This doesn't look like a mark. This looks like, um,

304
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:09,239
like crayon wax or something. It looks cool. It's digital. Well, if it's digital,

305
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:14,199
it's supposed to be mimicking something. Like is it looks like kind of like wax, like crayon.

306
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:21,619
All the brush and Photoshop. Yeah. I know. I know. I know. I'm saying like it's like it's waxy.

307
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:58,329
Look, do you know what I'm saying? It's texture. Yeah. Like a crayon, like you and what is all

308
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:03,769
these, the animals from the Sims, the Sims for a second. I was like, is this the right streamer?

309
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:08,010
Is this like a different person? Okay. It's the drug dealer from the sim. Okay.

310
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:39,880
Buy drug, please buy drugs from me. Clip and report him. Oh, get out of here. This is, uh,

311
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:50,019
at the very least seven four confirmed. We're, if we're being honest. All right. So then yeah.

312
00:48:50,019 --> 00:49:03,239
So seven four, that makes me how tall that's a, let's just say that's a full foot, right? Let's

313
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:16,099
say this is a full foot shorter, right? That's like six four, six three. What does it say? By

314
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:21,780
the way, where to pop this shirt? LOL. Asking for a friend. Um, I got that Nightwing shirt

315
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:30,650
at a clearance section at, um, I don't remember the store. It was, it was, it was the clearance

316
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,889
section. It was just like, these are things that are on sale. Hey, it was from some comic book store.

317
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:43,929
I don't remember what it was. I don't want to give you false info. It wasn't Walmart.

318
00:49:45,340 --> 00:50:08,409
Walmart does not have Nightwing shirts. I could do it. Same universe as Nightwing.

319
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:18,820
Yes, they are in the same universe. It's a clown car, I believe. Looking good.

320
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:31,420
Uh, I got something to tell you guys. Caught his mic. Oh, these are doodles. Okay. I'm never

321
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,579
getting rid of that shirt. I hope nothing bad happens to that shirt. Really. You know, sometimes

322
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:39,500
you go into the wash and you take clothes out and one of your shirts is just like torn up for

323
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,659
some reason. You're just like, oh, what the fuck? I really hope it doesn't happen to the Nightwing

324
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:53,269
shirt. It's going to get caught somewhere and get torn or something. I'm going to, now, fuck it. I'm

325
00:50:53,269 --> 00:51:01,219
going to start hand washing that shirt. That's, that's, I'm hand washing that. I'm not going to

326
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:15,639
put it in the washing machine. I'm scared. Go down here to the rat. Michael smells. There you are.

327
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:26,230
Look, I even zoomed in on it. Everybody loves Sheet Hill. You know, has it made an appearance

328
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:33,300
on stream in like six months? He's on vacation. No, he's on vacation. I'll come back soon. He's

329
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:41,769
on a long vacation. He's on a very, very long vacation. And I realize that's what you say

330
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:55,900
children when, uh, somebody potentially dies. But Cheeto is doing just fine.

331
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:09,159
When your fish dies. Where's, where's Mr. Guppy? Oh, oh, little Timmy. He's,

332
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,760
he's just on a long vacation. Oh, because you know that that kid's going to forget

333
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:29,420
everything about that fish in like two months. But that's not the case. He went on vacation.

334
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:41,750
Uh, huge money came in. Huge money. Mick Tavishes gave 10,000 bits. Thank you, Mick Tavishes.

335
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:48,409
10,000 bits. Yoruba, I swore a long time ago that I'd give you big bits once I got a full-time gig.

336
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:57,659
I did. So here's big bits. Thank you. Those are very big. Those are enormous bits. Those are,

337
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:03,449
that's a hundred fucking dollars worth of bits. That's a lot of money. Thank you for the ridiculous

338
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:14,809
bit drop. Glad to hear you got a full-time gig. It pays well. Did you eat Cheeto? Is he inside of

339
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:38,679
you? Why did I read that one? Excuse me. I like this, uh, kind of the neon look. I like this down

340
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:52,090
here. This is a Jojo reference. It probably is. Yeah, it is. Right. I've never even seen Jojo,

341
00:53:52,090 --> 00:54:00,170
but I feel like I know the first five episodes already. Looks very good though. I do like it.

342
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:14,820
Those like blended neon edges. I went to art school. Failed, but I did.

343
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:34,199
It's Mr. Sneak Man. Look at, look at this neck. We got the, we got the same neck. I'm not looking.

344
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,559
Ew. Yeah. I look at some, I told you, I don't care. At some point you have to,

345
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:49,400
at some point you have to accept that you have a turkey neck. Or like a turtle.

346
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:56,699
I remember a couple of years ago when I still was like, oh, I don't like that. I looked up

347
00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:02,539
and this is real. I looked up like how to get rid of the weird turtle lines on your neck.

348
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:20,380
I looked it up. Uh, it turns out you can't, you kind of can't. I started moisturizing down here.

349
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:25,940
This is fine. This is going to be fine for a very long time. This is going to be just fine.

350
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:33,500
This, however, is not going to be fine over the next 10 years. I'm going to be one of those people.

351
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:39,019
I'm going to, I'm just going to wear turtlenecks. I'm going to be like at the beach in a turtleneck.

352
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:42,460
People are going to be like, oh, wow. How old are you? You look really, really young.

353
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:51,079
Yeah. I, um, I'm, I'm, I'm 41. It's like, well, your voice fucking sounds old for that.

354
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:54,519
Yeah. I'm 41. And my, but my face is going to look fucking fricking like this.

355
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:59,880
And then I'm going to, I'm going to like take my shirt off at the beach and it's going to be just

356
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,920
like dusty and wrinkled and decrepit. And everyone's going to be like, holy shit. I thought that guy was

357
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:26,199
like 40. He's like 70. I'm going to have like a young face at like 60. You're a lich. Ego. Perfect

358
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:46,150
face. You, we all have perfect faces in the eyes of the Lord. Come on. Oh, this is, oh, wait, wait.

359
00:56:46,869 --> 00:57:02,619
This one's a little more abstract. Who is this person? I, I need, who is this person? I don't

360
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:08,300
know. Like who, who is this imitating this, like this thing? Who is this? What character is this?

361
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:17,769
The character's name is Killer Queen. I got, I got to look this up eventually. I'm going to like look

362
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:23,449
up, I'm going to go to like the Killer Queen, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Wikipedia profile fan page

363
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:39,030
and just read. I like this though. I'm a little more, I'm a little more jacked in this one,

364
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:51,530
the name of this one. I like how Bob, I got a nice, a nice, a nice buff look to me. Watch Jojo. No,

365
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:57,179
I can't. It's too many people have told me to do that. All right. You know when enough people tell

366
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:01,820
you to do something and they preface this always by going, hey, oh, you should really, you could,

367
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:08,539
you would really love Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, but skip the first two seasons though. No, no,

368
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:13,340
no, no, just don't watch the first like three seasons. Watch season four and season seven

369
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:18,389
and then they, and season six, halfway through season six. Don't watch the first two seasons

370
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:28,780
ever. Don't skip. What the fuck? Don't skip. What the fuck? Nobody says that. How many times? Hold

371
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:35,639
on. We gotta, we gotta go over this. People, I have heard not to watch the first season of Jojo's

372
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:39,000
Bizarre Adventure because it's like fucking different. It's not the same. People don't like

373
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:55,929
it. First season sucks. Don't skip it. Those are fake fans. Wrong. You see my eyes fucking scrolling

374
00:58:55,929 --> 00:59:02,250
through this. Look at, I'm like, I can't even read, like, I feel like I'm reading a reverse teleprompter

375
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:08,179
and they have it at times 10 speed. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

376
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,260
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

377
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,619
I'll watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. That's my fucking, all right. You know what? Fuck it.

378
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:17,139
Listen to this. Listen to me. I'm gonna look you directly in the eye for this one. I am allowed

379
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:26,340
one anime per year. It's 2020 and it's not going to be Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. It's, it's going to

380
00:59:26,340 --> 01:00:00,599
be back on Titan season four. Oh, I like, this is good. This is a great image. It really is.

381
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:16,340
There's Halloween mask Jerma. This is a great image for, I don't know if it works in an emote,

382
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:33,619
but this is like backseat gaming. This is backseat gaming the image. I fucking know everything.

383
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:37,219
I'm sorry. I know everything about you and you're not doing it. Let me help you here. Let me help

384
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:42,099
you here. You insignificant tiny fucking non person that's ever played the game before. I

385
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:55,210
know everything. That's good. I like it. What else we got here? Then you got the stomach,

386
01:00:55,849 --> 01:01:10,820
stomach is, is very accurate. Why is the giant ride coming to kill me? He's got a knife in his

387
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:39,030
hand. What does it say? Chat is cute. Oh, I don't, I've got, hold on. Let me move the camera for a

388
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:48,010
second. I want you to see who made this. I thought it was about him. It could have been.

389
01:01:51,940 --> 01:02:13,079
Pymations. This is fantastic. Thank you. I love it. All right. This image just makes me happy.

390
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:19,019
You know what I mean? This is one of those images that you look at and you're just like,

391
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:26,329
I'm happy right now for a minute. The oven mitts. What a nice touch, right?

392
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:45,260
Can we have any nice things guys? Can we have nice things at all? Get your mind out of the gutter.

393
01:02:53,829 --> 01:03:04,920
I, I don't mean, I don't know. All I see in this image are a nearly Academy award winning actor

394
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:14,440
and a top 20 streamer on Twitch. I don't, I mean, I don't see anything else in this image that could

395
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:35,369
be producing anything negative. I don't understand. I mean, I, I, I see like a, a, a nearly

396
01:03:35,369 --> 01:03:45,139
Academy award nominated actor and, and, and, and, and, and one of the top influencers on the

397
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:52,760
platform. I fucking hate that word. That word sucks. Remember we've, we've gone over that word

398
01:03:52,760 --> 01:04:01,739
before. The influencer is so stupid. It's like they couldn't figure out what to call this group

399
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:11,510
of people because let's be honest. It's not like, it's not like we're fucking solving

400
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:15,880
like world problems. You know what I mean? It's just like, Oh, what do you do?

401
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:35,449
Entertainer. Oh, do you though? Are you Adam Sandler? And they go, no, no, no, no. You influence

402
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:45,900
people to do things. That's so fucking creepy though. What I don't want to be like influencing

403
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:53,260
you guys to do something that's weird. Hey guys, I just want to make sure you feel very influenced

404
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:59,130
by me today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This, this, this, this, this is going to get like, this might get

405
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:05,190
20,000 influence points. I said something and you clicked on it and you, you agree with it and I

406
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:09,190
influenced your opinion. I'm influencing you right now. You just don't understand it. You just don't

407
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:20,820
know. No, I prefer Eclan. I way prefer that because influencer makes it sound like I'm supposed to be

408
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:41,210
selling a product right now. Eclan, way better. You are selling a product. You're selling. Hey,

409
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:47,780
BRBs buying a night wing t-shirt. I just want to dick around on the internet and like have fun. And

410
01:05:47,780 --> 01:06:01,110
I don't, no, no, no, don't call me an influencer or I'll ban you. Your actions have consequences,

411
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:25,289
Jeremy. Wait, what? Inside of two Jermas. Jerma lied about what? Jerma lied about 20, Jerma lied,

412
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:37,530
Jerma lied about sour in 24 hours. No, I didn't. I did that within 24 hours. That's, that's horseshit.

413
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:46,300
I did that. We got another huge bits. Core Monster gave $50 in bits. You're my favorite influencer,

414
01:06:46,300 --> 01:07:13,829
Jerma. Eclan. Eclan, corrected. Uh, thank you for the 5,000 bits though. You know how bad

415
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:21,510
somewhere in my brain I want to get on like the fortune 500 list and I could, it would be a fortune

416
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:33,139
500 Eclan. Can you imagine having to read that as like a guy that owns like 600 fucking real estate

417
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:40,440
properties? Oh, let me see where I am. Well, I own, what do I own? I own fucking, I own Macy's Target

418
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:48,199
and I also, I have 500 corporate offices. What's the next page? Jerma985, the influencer Eclan.

419
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:58,179
He just like tears it out and the fucking rips it and crumples it up and fucking eats it.

420
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:08,500
Still an influencer. Fuck. What does he do? What does he, what does he even do?

421
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:19,739
How, how he is, he's at 1.6 billion. I'm only in 1.72 billion. I can't, I can't let this happen.

422
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:35,479
I can't let this happen. I can't let this fucking Eclan take over my empire. Anyways, if anybody

423
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:50,840
needed any more confirmation as to Eclan. All right, this is like hurts my head. Okay. Uh,

424
01:08:50,840 --> 01:09:06,039
red germ redemption. I think we've seen this before. This is still good. Still very good.

425
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:13,340
Free views. What the fuck? Come on. Get the helicopter sound effect on the last one. No,

426
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:32,149
this is good shit. Betty White the goat. You know, Betty White has a slot machine in Vegas.

427
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:38,619
It's called, I'm not, I'm not making the, it's called, it's called Betty White's Fairy Tales,

428
01:09:38,619 --> 01:09:45,979
a story time or something. And she has this huge comically oversized like medieval book in her hands

429
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:51,260
and she's just like, Oh, hey, welcome everybody. It's me, Betty White. Welcome to my fairy tale.

430
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,739
Isn't she like tells you stories while you play the machine. I don't know this by the way. I've

431
01:09:55,739 --> 01:10:08,979
just seen it. I've seen it in advertisement. She like reads the stories to you. I've walked by this

432
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:17,670
before going, just walked by it. So am I, am I right? 2020. Am I right for 2020? What do you mean?

433
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:34,359
Am I right? Oh, am I right for 2020? What does that mean? Anime, anime for 2020. What does that

434
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:46,380
mean? For some reason, the one that I said makes more sense to me. Fireman. This is from Mikey

435
01:10:46,380 --> 01:11:07,960
Loki. I love this song. What a great game by the way. Such a good game. Betty White slot machine.

436
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:14,090
What would you guys do if one day I turned on a stream and I didn't introduce anything?

437
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:22,180
I was sitting in front of the Betty White slot machine and just played it for like four straight

438
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:35,659
hours. And then I, and I turned to the camera when I had no more money left. And I just go like,

439
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:49,449
hey, can I, can I bum a 20? Hey, can I bum a 20? And then, and then a hype trend happens.

440
01:11:50,010 --> 01:12:06,970
I don't say a word for three hours. Nobody would give anything. I know. And they should.

441
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:13,529
Casinos and slot machines are a category on Twitch and there are quite a few servers who make

442
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:20,630
bank on that stuff. No, I, no, no. All right. Here's the thing about streaming. Streaming

443
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:27,590
gambling to me is the same thing. If I were to stream myself full screen, smoking cigarettes,

444
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:49,109
just talking. It's like smooth. That's very smooth. Or like just streaming myself

445
01:12:49,989 --> 01:12:56,949
drinking alcohol full screen without even talking. I don't, you know, it's one of those things that

446
01:12:56,949 --> 01:13:01,270
it's like, it's don't want to like, I don't want to like promote gambling to anybody.

447
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:05,590
I don't want to promote like smoking cigarettes. It's not like I would be

448
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:24,869
influencer, influencer, influencer, influencer. Let's zoom in here. Uh, this is called

449
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:30,329
chair Montauk. Hi, let me be frank, Mr. Elbertson. You were never going to get the job in the first

450
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:36,409
place. This is an institution full of children. I called you here to ask a question. Why'd you do

451
01:13:36,409 --> 01:14:14,739
it? Why'd I do what? Small pupils seems confused or concerned. Chat told me to Christmas killing.

452
01:14:14,739 --> 01:14:23,289
Okay. I see. Even though he killed Santa, he needs to be, he needs to have friendly eyes.

453
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:36,470
Most of the time drew. I drew this. Don't steal original character. And I got the Aquaman shirt

454
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:54,039
on. Wait, don't steal original character. And this me, this is me. People's legs aren't that

455
01:14:54,039 --> 01:15:06,279
fucking long. I'm sorry. Oh no. Stolen. That was fucking funny. All right. We got fireman with,

456
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:18,460
uh, what's that say? Anybody know what that says? It says, look at this dude. Look at this dude.

457
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:38,260
That's awesome. Look at this dude. That's cute. Very good. Wait till you see the one. What are

458
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:48,739
you talking about? It says watch Jojo season four only. This is very, very good. The, uh,

459
01:15:48,739 --> 01:16:01,180
any watermark on it? No, there's not, but very good. I can't fucking take it seriously. I'm at

460
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:30,569
my limit. You're about listening to farts, slapping. Let me move my camera out of the way.

461
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:41,880
This is from sins. Sin Sue. This is very, very, very high quality stuff here.

462
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:54,840
Here's some donkey donut because you're epic. I follow like fucking 20 people on Twitter and

463
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:00,760
half of them are people that I followed back when I was like a machinima partner in like 2012.

464
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:13,510
I don't, I don't even use Twitter. This is great though. Follow them. Follow this account. They

465
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:29,449
post fucking good shit. It's pronounced scenes. Scenes. Okay. Oh scenes. Blocking his name. I'm

466
01:17:29,449 --> 01:17:39,060
trying. I think there's another one too, uh, by the same artist. There it is. Season four. A good

467
01:17:39,060 --> 01:18:01,939
one. Season four. All right. Let me give, we're not ever knowing and not ever seeing what this was

468
01:18:02,659 --> 01:18:09,590
and not knowing what I was doing. This is a pretty damn good job. I would say for not knowing. This

469
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:33,140
one, not so much. This one pretty damn good. I don't even know what I was doing, but this is

470
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:47,350
great. Germ stranding. Awesome stuff. Never played this game, but heard it was very good. But I have

471
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:57,399
this thing where I don't play games that are a hundred hours long. I don't really do it. Uh,

472
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:06,250
I just don't have like time. It really, I, Red Dead Redemption 2 took me think like 40 something,

473
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:14,979
50 something. I don't have time for it. No, I don't have time. I don't have time. This is awesome

474
01:19:14,979 --> 01:19:27,029
though. You beat it off stream. I did. It's like 30 to 50 hours. Let's get that artist over here.

475
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:37,670
Make sure I don't block their name. Evan Maple Syrup. 100 hour stream. Imagine the joke potential.

476
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:49,100
Uh, no, I think after like 40 or 50 plus hours in the same game, that's when I start reaching

477
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:54,380
and I go, man, I've been, I've been doing the same thing for like 50, 60 straight hours.

478
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:59,739
I should probably like come up with something to do, say, and then people guys is where I get the,

479
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:13,460
that's where I get the farming minus twos. All right. Why is everybody spamming it? I don't get it.

480
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:20,500
I don't understand. It's just maybe like a big mouth, like a big toilet or something. What is

481
01:20:20,500 --> 01:21:00,939
this? Toilet bowl that you shaded over. I don't get it. Why is there no toilet seat? That's a

482
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:09,989
good question. I don't know. Derma peeve. Look at this dude. Nice to meet you. Somebody gets it.

483
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:30,199
I never get dehydrated. I recycle all, um, I don't know what that is. This is show face, please.

484
01:21:31,239 --> 01:21:35,159
I don't get it. This is supposed to be you. It's supposed to be you guys.

485
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:45,539
And then I'm showing my face. Yeah. The nice touch fireman is put out because of how wet I am.

486
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:58,060
No other face. I only have one, man. This is great though. Thank you. I'm gonna get some more here.

487
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:14,119
This is, uh, Derma rumble. I got the artists there in the corner. Who's up here? Who's,

488
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:34,090
who's watching? Minecraft. Uh, I don't know. Uh, Mario and Luigi. Uh, Peter, uh, Peter Griffin. Yep.

489
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:51,180
Brover. Brover. Uh, that's the worst Peter. Bill Gates. I've never said Bill Gates before.

490
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:58,069
I don't think I've ever said it before. Look at how much bigger I am than these two puny,

491
01:22:58,069 --> 01:23:04,630
puny combatants. I don't even stand a chance. Look, even you even need to bring a chair this

492
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:18,710
time. You got to bring a chair. This is the might that I, you know what I mean? I don't know. I'm

493
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:23,859
trying to think of the word for exudes. There it is. Thank you. Somebody said it. Uh, this is

494
01:23:23,859 --> 01:23:44,819
great though. Thank you. From that one big chicken stream that somebody squished my face together and

495
01:23:44,819 --> 01:24:17,079
just looks modern. Modern. Derma Warhol. Oh, this is impressive if it really is two inches tall.

496
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:22,550
That's kind of, that's very detailed for being two inches tall. Do you have like one of those big

497
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:38,869
magnifying glasses? Like the guys that fix watches? It's real life scale. Draw onto scale. Everybody

498
01:24:38,869 --> 01:24:45,210
say it. Yell about it. Everybody yell it. This is really detailed though. It really is. Thanks a

499
01:24:45,210 --> 01:25:03,029
lot Quinn. The Axe Fireman by Mikey Loki again. Look at the itchy eye. Sometimes this happens

500
01:25:03,029 --> 01:25:10,489
where like the lining of my eye will just be itchy, itchy, itchy, itchy for not even like 10

501
01:25:10,489 --> 01:25:19,829
minutes and then it goes away. Like, oh, it's horrible. It's just only one eye too. I want to

502
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:27,340
itch it. I know I try not to. Oh God. Oh God. What does this mean? What does it mean? What does this

503
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:37,699
actually mean? Anybody know what this means? It's just like, oh, horrible scratch. Itchy. Horrible.

504
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:53,430
This is great work though. Get well soon, Jeremy. And this is from Invaders. Doing my best. Doing

505
01:25:53,430 --> 01:26:03,829
my best. Appropriate. How do they know about the eye? Spliceable spleen. Five immunity subs. Thank

506
01:26:03,829 --> 01:26:10,890
you spliceable spleen. Look at eye drops. Eye drops are tricky for me because when I put eye drops in,

507
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:16,649
I know they're coming and I know it's about to happen and I just tear up. I start crying and

508
01:26:16,649 --> 01:26:21,289
then it hits my eye and it's like just tears streaming down my face and it almost makes it worse.

509
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:31,239
It's, I can't, it's just weird to me. I can't, somebody else, I can't, if somebody else is

510
01:26:31,239 --> 01:26:39,479
going to do it, not possible. I have to do it myself. Every time I'm outside in the wind,

511
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:46,739
I think it's just really sensitive eyes because when I go out in the wind, I will get these just

512
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:53,619
tears that just blow back like this until I get inside and then I have this like redness

513
01:26:53,619 --> 01:27:09,859
from the lines of tears. Somebody's redeem a wink. Yeah, yep. Which eye? The irritated one?

514
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:14,090
You get to pick the eye. Which one? The irritated eye or the non-irritated eye?

515
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:35,609
Which one? Irritated? Irritated. Okay. I have to move my mouth when I wink. I don't know why.

516
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:43,239
You know what I'm saying? It's like the muscle that's here is connected to here. Is that odd?

517
01:27:43,239 --> 01:28:10,489
Like, it's normal? Good. There you go. Excellent work. Whoa, this is, this is, this is busy.

518
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:17,350
This one's real busy. Let's get out of the way for this one. All right, we got the moon. We've got

519
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:26,069
Gloom Man. We've got Cheeto. We've got Pac-Man. Gloom Man. This is me. Beam Bag Sonic. That's the

520
01:28:26,069 --> 01:28:33,829
air, hot air balloon. Nightwing. Why is everybody, what's with the Nightwing? How many times have I

521
01:28:33,829 --> 01:28:46,420
worn that shirt on camera? Oh, it's Jax. That's right. It's Jax. Hundreds, you think? All right.

522
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:50,659
I just had a, you may have seen it in my face because the camera's on, but I just had like an

523
01:28:50,659 --> 01:29:10,260
internal, is it on now? For a tenth of a second. This is fucking scary. What is going on here?

524
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:25,100
What is this? What? It's Fireman, but it is like a, what is the rat? What is this? Is this my room?

525
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:30,939
Oh, that's the door. Oh, the body sliders. Right, right, right, right, right. Okay. This is crazy.

526
01:29:30,939 --> 01:29:39,800
This is crazy. I love it. An artist name? Any artist name on here? I don't see it.

527
01:29:40,359 --> 01:29:50,869
I do not see an artist name. No, I don't. Thank you, though. Garfield down in the corner. I just,

528
01:29:50,869 --> 01:30:23,659
I didn't acknowledge Garfield. I don't know what this is. It's a JoJo thing. I, I got, I got a question.

529
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:32,810
So, I've never seen the show. I don't know what this is. I don't know what that is.

530
01:30:33,609 --> 01:30:48,550
What's the proper reaction to have to that image if I've never seen the show? Like, yeah, I know

531
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:55,659
those two people. That's, I don't know, for all I know, guys, this is, what the fuck is that?

532
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:05,659
Uh, okay. For all I know, wait a minute, I was going to say that, oh my God. Okay, I was just

533
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:11,260
going to say, for all I know, this could be Beavis and Butthead. And the image that I just showed on

534
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:26,649
stream was a combination of Beavis and Butthead. I was going to say this could be just Beavis and

535
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:43,050
fucking Butthead, and I don't know who they are. The ultimate streamer. Ask Joel about JoJo.

536
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:48,810
No, what is he going to say? Hey, dude, wait, what, what about JoJo? And he's going to go,

537
01:31:49,689 --> 01:31:54,739
ah, it's a good show. You should watch it. Joel, are you sure you don't want to show me

538
01:31:54,739 --> 01:32:06,949
these characters? Why don't you show me two of the characters on stream? Hey, Joel, what, hey,

539
01:32:07,109 --> 01:32:11,909
Joel, what about, uh, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure? And he's like, oh, journal. He turns on his webcam

540
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:28,199
and starts like, doing like poses and shit. I'll be like, now I get it. Now I get it. But, uh,

541
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:33,460
long story short, I don't get it. Maybe some of you do. I don't know what this is supposed to convey.

542
01:32:34,260 --> 01:33:03,189
There's no, no shoes on. No shoes on with a plastic bat. Oh, this is, and the, the picture

543
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:15,850
is going into the motion of throwing the ball and I'm not fucking ready. Oh, here's the back of the

544
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:21,720
card. Jeremy Elbertson, Boston Red Sox, hometown, Boston, Massachusetts. Positions shortstop.

545
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:27,930
After rage quitting tennis, Elbertson made his way to the realm of professional baseball

546
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:36,409
with an all-time batting average of 0.001, which actually means I probably got walked

547
01:33:37,289 --> 01:33:43,029
once in 10,000 at bat. Oh no, batting average. That means I accidentally like,

548
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:48,789
bunted. Not on base percentage. Okay. Jeremy's only major league hit was a walk off grand slam

549
01:33:48,789 --> 01:34:00,279
that won the Red Sox the World Series last year. Last year. When asked about the historic moment,

550
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:07,159
club manager Alex Costa said, look, this guy wasn't here supposed to be on the team. David Ortiz got

551
01:34:07,159 --> 01:34:11,960
the flu and we just had to pick some dickhead from the crowd. Who even are you? How did you

552
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:22,470
get into the locker room? Did somebody link that video of me in the two grand slams? That's like

553
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:27,430
my favorite video. Where's the video of me doing the two big home runs? That's like, that's my

554
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:34,100
favorite video on YouTube. Where is it? I have to, I'm going to queue it up for the video portion.

555
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:55,060
I love that video so much. All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. Is this it? Sign in to confirm your

556
01:34:55,060 --> 01:35:04,060
age. Oh, get the fuck out of here. Give me the real video. It's not it either. You guys are,

557
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:24,739
why are you guys so unhelpful sometimes? Right here, right here. No, that's not the one. This

558
01:35:24,739 --> 01:35:33,380
is not the right one. This too. This too. I'm going to throw both. I love this so, no, I don't,

559
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:40,020
stop linking me this video. I know I said that 15 years ago. I know. All right, where's the,

560
01:35:40,020 --> 01:36:03,109
where's the one that's the two? Unhelp. This is, what are you doing? No, you, I can see, I've

561
01:36:03,109 --> 01:36:13,560
memorized the rickroll one now. Somebody please help me. Mods, mods, mods. I'm like calling my

562
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:27,399
mods like I call my mother. Mods, mods, mods. No, there's, there's, there's another one. There's,

563
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:36,340
there's one, there's two when I do the overhead swing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

564
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:43,720
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Mods, mods.

565
01:36:46,979 --> 01:37:00,819
No, mods. Soup has the right one. Soup. There it is. Okay, there it is. There it is. Oh my goodness.

566
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:08,579
This is like my favorite video on YouTube. All right. Okay, that only took fucking like

567
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:33,739
six straight minutes. Hi, bullet hole. Good shit. Show the video. I'm going to put it in this whole

568
01:37:33,739 --> 01:37:38,229
video portion that's coming up in like probably 30 minutes. I'm not going to show it. I got it.

569
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:55,670
It's right. I got it. There's a whole video portion. Just, that one's free. Oh, I almost

570
01:37:55,670 --> 01:38:12,390
instinctively just fucking clicked the X. Look at those. Look at those bumps. Thermobumpy.

571
01:38:17,479 --> 01:38:22,760
All right. Click the X. Click this. Jeff, thank you. Thank you. Rhode Island, Jeff. Thank you.

572
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:26,680
Oh, this. Another one. Another one. Another one. I want to get rid of another one. I don't like the

573
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:41,130
veins in the eyes. I don't like the eyes. This is. All right. That's fucking really good art though.

574
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:51,770
Really good art by Iraqli. OD. Thank you. Outline Miami? Oh, look at this one. This one's good.

575
01:38:52,569 --> 01:39:04,539
This is by Teens again. I'm going to get out of the way so you can see the whole thing. Christmas.

576
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:12,340
This is pretty much every major holiday terrain this year. In Germany you look like Harrison Ford.

577
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:20,140
That's a compliment. I'll take it. Motion blur. Yeah, that's a pretty good touch.

578
01:39:20,779 --> 01:39:27,989
Those of you that might be new viewers, in point blank two, I did the bonus round, which is nearly

579
01:39:27,989 --> 01:39:35,779
impossible for any humans to do. You have to shoot 30 targets that are in a line in five seconds.

580
01:39:35,779 --> 01:39:49,109
Humans actually can't do this. I did it. You didn't do it. Fine. I didn't. Somebody else did,

581
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:56,199
but they live in my same body, so that's fine. The humans can't do it. They connected it to a

582
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:59,479
fucking computer and finally like scientists were all gathered around. They were like,

583
01:39:59,479 --> 01:40:07,479
holy shit, we actually could do it now. And then I showed up. Or a person that lives in my head did.

584
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:30,260
That was not me. His name's Jackson. I love this. I want this. I want to sell this, but not this.

585
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:35,380
You know what I mean? You know, sometimes streamers and YouTubers do, oh, we're going to do pops.

586
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:40,420
Oh, yeah. I'm going to get a pop made of me, a little figure, and it's going to be me going like,

587
01:40:41,899 --> 01:40:47,899
but like, I don't want that. I don't want just like a, no, no, no. I want this.

588
01:40:48,939 --> 01:41:01,109
I want this to be sold. I want that to be me. I don't want it to be like a pop. I want to sell

589
01:41:01,109 --> 01:41:17,239
something like this and have it just be supposed to be me. 3D printed. U2s it. What is U2s?

590
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:24,420
U2 sounds like, like, I feel like there's like a, like a, it's not like a dot com after that.

591
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:29,539
That's like a fake YouTube. Like accidentally have people click on something. U2s dot what?

592
01:41:38,899 --> 01:41:51,189
That's like a, they make, they make pop vinyls for YouTubers. Oh, oh, okay. For YouTubers.

593
01:41:55,130 --> 01:42:06,310
How expensive are they? Actual porn links in chat. I'm not clicking on anything.

594
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:08,149
I got plenty of links already queued up here.

595
01:42:15,159 --> 01:42:21,239
Got the smirk down. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

596
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:24,199
I am going to personally come in here and time this person up.

597
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:29,159
No, I can't even, cause I can't do that. Physically, I can't even right click in here.

598
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:39,960
Like the broadcast software that I'm using. I haven't changed. This is my own fault.

599
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:55,479
All right. Very good work. Very clean. I'm hogging Jerma. Please relax. Hold it in.

600
01:42:57,819 --> 01:43:05,699
Hold it until the video section. Jerma, please. What? What? What did I just do?

601
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:13,670
Hold it in. I thought like, I'm like, by my breath, I'm hogging. Hold, ah, whatever. I don't care.

602
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:26,779
This is good shit though. Really nice work. This is a depiction of the Halloween stream

603
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:43,020
when, uh, Fugleberry was doing something and that's fucking funny. Free me?

604
01:43:43,899 --> 01:43:49,020
Some of you that might have not seen the Halloween stream, uh, there was a segment

605
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:56,380
where BF Fugleberry, who's a very well-liked character, uh, did a pottery class to YouTube,

606
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:03,590
to you, to the people watching. There was a segment on that stream and the stream had

607
01:44:04,789 --> 01:44:11,430
8,000 or 9,000 concurrent people watching it. And after about 20 to 30 seconds of this character

608
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:16,390
being on screen doing the pottery, this is not a joke. This is not me making this up and embellishing

609
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:24,300
to like, oh, look how funny, that's fake. A 3,000 concurrent people left. 3,000 concurrent people

610
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:48,890
dumped me fucking immediately. It was an unbearable segment. It was the reverb. I know. It was a lot

611
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:55,260
of things. But yes, this is, I love this. This is by, uh, Needles and Noodles, if you can't see.

612
01:44:58,819 --> 01:45:02,420
It was the audio and I didn't even know. It's all right. I'm gonna never forget that.

613
01:45:06,489 --> 01:45:17,699
Somebody just shit my pants. Also from the Halloween stream when I climbed. I do remember that.

614
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:30,869
It was a very, very uncomfortable feeling. Did not feel very good. By the way, you know, like,

615
01:45:30,869 --> 01:45:33,590
when you, when you look at yourself in pictures or in the mirror or something,

616
01:45:34,869 --> 01:45:39,109
I feel like, I feel like that's what I see in the mirror. You know what I mean? Like, there are days

617
01:45:39,109 --> 01:45:49,180
when I'm like, no, I don't have a bald fucking head. It's the way my hair is parted. I just

618
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:55,239
want to make sure everyone's aware. It's the way my hair is just parted for a second. Black.

619
01:45:55,239 --> 01:45:59,720
Nobody can freak out. I know the people are going to clip that and go, oh, because that's what we

620
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:04,199
do on Twitch. If somebody's got a bald head, we fucking point it out every day. If somebody's

621
01:46:04,199 --> 01:46:09,960
smaller than 5'10", we point it out every day. And that's what we do. That's what we do on Twitch.

622
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:16,520
Welcome to Twitch.tv. Oh, it's nothing, but it's also everything. By the way, don't be bald or

623
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:36,649
small because we'll hear about it every day. Anyways, someone just shit my pants. Bald, bald.

624
01:46:36,649 --> 01:46:48,600
It gets funnier every time. The music just like changed to angry and it's like fucking freaking

625
01:46:48,600 --> 01:47:00,380
me out. Okay. Back to normal. Back, back to what we were doing. Community content. Like, oh yeah.

626
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:06,779
All right. This is just like, this is just a spray paint tool. This is just spray paint.

627
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:23,210
This is pretty good. This is pretty good. Oh, did you buy this on Redbubble? You got your weird,

628
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:39,289
like, what are these, what are they called? What, you got it? What's it called? A Germanium?

629
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:48,380
A Germanium? Uranium? What are you guys saying? Uranium. I can't, the chat is going too fast.

630
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:55,020
I can't read it. It's going too fast for me to read it.

631
01:47:55,020 --> 01:48:04,140
Germanium. Germanium. Germanium. Pretty cool. Pretty cool. What does it weigh when people come

632
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:21,399
over? I think this is farming dynasty. Just scroll chat. No, that don't work. If I scroll chat,

633
01:48:21,399 --> 01:48:26,680
if I scroll up, scroll up, it comes, rips back down. Scroll up, rips back down. It happens.

634
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:42,069
Who made this? Me. I did. Me, me. I did. Me, me, me. Yeah. Okay, cool. Nice job, everybody.

635
01:48:42,149 --> 01:49:03,829
This is from The Sims. He's sick of us. No. No, I'm not. I mean, that did come off. That,

636
01:49:03,829 --> 01:49:11,210
that did come off as, like, like, over it. But I assure you, I'm not. I just, like, I know that's

637
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:15,930
what's gonna happen. I know I'm gonna look over it. I'm just, I'm saying it for you. I'm doing it,

638
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:27,510
I'm saying it for you. You don't have to say it. He hates streaming. Do not. You wink and then you

639
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:40,779
leave. Why are you stealing our jokes? I'm here too, man. It can't be me. I made this. I made this.

640
01:49:45,989 --> 01:49:57,430
No, it was me. No, it wasn't. It was me. I did this. My eyes at you again. No, you know who actually

641
01:49:57,430 --> 01:50:05,479
did this? It was Rhode Island. You didn't make this. Neither did I. We have to unionize now.

642
01:50:07,189 --> 01:50:15,989
You guys are gonna unionize. We're gonna unionize. It was the whole state of Rhode Island.

643
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:28,520
Why is my eye so itchy? Oh, I'm gonna get so mad. Oh, I'm gonna get so mad. What? So, so,

644
01:50:33,529 --> 01:50:46,180
he's going too fast. Take a Benadryl. Oh, take a Benadryl. Oh, I'm gonna take a fucking Benadryl.

645
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:57,300
Hell, my 6k viewers have unionized. What the fuck would that even mean? This is awesome,

646
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:16,970
though. I love this. Thank you. This is from The Thing. Oh, I keep having flashbacks of that

647
01:51:18,170 --> 01:51:27,300
particular scene inside of the vent. God, that game was fucking ridiculous. I don't own Benadryl.

648
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:34,390
Benadryl is a medicine that your parents have in the house, but you don't. You know what I mean?

649
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:47,979
I don't have Benadryl. I have Tylenol and Nyquil. This is fantastic, though. I love this a lot.

650
01:51:50,489 --> 01:52:01,109
Test him. Test that guy. Test him. Make sure we can see the artist's name. If we do, we can.

651
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:07,350
If you take too much Nyquil- If you take too- Wait, hold on. If you take too much,

652
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:24,939
you'll start seeing spiders. Omega lol. Take too much what? Giant enemy spider. Benadryl. Is that

653
01:52:24,939 --> 01:52:37,050
real? Omega lol. What? Fog champ. Jax. I have a Jax pose. Oh, this is supposed to be my smile.

654
01:52:42,920 --> 01:53:01,270
God damn it. How did you know I was going to do this? Thank you, Todd. Oh, look at this one.

655
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:17,060
Stay tuned. Is this Shito? Snowman. This one's interesting. Look at all this stuff going on

656
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:28,340
back here. All over here. Snowman and Fireman. Wouldn't Snowman melt right now? Be careful,

657
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:43,800
Snowman. Stay tuned. This is a comfy image. Comfy image. Get the whole thing from it. Good

658
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:48,439
stuff. So you're going to notice there's probably going to be a little bit of Christmas or a lot of

659
01:53:48,439 --> 01:53:52,520
Christmas related stuff in here. I'm sure you've seen a couple already. That's because I didn't

660
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:59,880
do a community content night in December. So this is like all of November into like the middle of-

661
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:08,859
the end middle of December. So that's kind of where the cutoff is here. My bird likes

662
01:54:08,859 --> 01:54:18,659
your background music. Your bird's a hyper intelligent thing. It says, Jerma, I warned you

663
01:54:18,659 --> 01:54:39,979
not to watch. Really good teeth work. But that's- that's really like high quality teeth. Gums and

664
01:54:39,979 --> 01:54:49,909
everything. This is- it's terrifying. It's very well done. Good teeth, by the way. A coat hanger

665
01:54:49,909 --> 01:54:59,819
in the closet. Down to the most minute of all details. Yes. Nice work. Who did this? Who made

666
01:54:59,819 --> 01:55:22,340
this? Not on there. Nice work though. Is it on there? Look at this shit. Now this. Oh yeah.

667
01:55:26,149 --> 01:55:38,260
I love how shiny it is. I'm gonna pick- this is gonna sound crazy. I know it is. Anybody else?

668
01:55:38,819 --> 01:55:41,619
It's too weird to say. It might be weird. Anybody else want to pick this up and smell it?

669
01:55:42,579 --> 01:55:47,420
I know what this smells like. You know, it's like a- that like kind of new plastic kind of shiny

670
01:55:47,420 --> 01:56:10,020
plastic smell. You right? New GameCube smell. Sure. I know what this smells like and sometimes

671
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:23,319
I need smells to like get like into a full package. Can't clip this so I can- clip this

672
01:56:23,319 --> 01:56:30,199
for the doctor because this- this whole thought is going to the doctor. Anyways, this is fantastic.

673
01:56:31,079 --> 01:56:48,619
It is very well done. It's very professional and it is made by this person here. Okay, I was- this

674
01:56:48,619 --> 01:56:55,560
one wasn't gonna make it in. Uh, but I- I mean like come on. This is just- I had- this- I- it's like

675
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:04,140
I'm gonna- I got it. I got it. This is cute. I love you, Jerma from Lucas. You and me. It's just like

676
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:17,479
that's- I can't- I can't just skip over this. Nice job, Lucas. Going on the fridge. And then of course

677
01:57:17,479 --> 01:57:32,460
we have the best boy in the world, Otto. This is so cute. And like this music is like making me emotional.

678
01:57:35,859 --> 01:57:39,699
You know what I'm saying? It's like I'm getting- I'm getting in the ears. I'm looking at this. It's

679
01:57:39,699 --> 01:57:45,779
like this is so- this is so- I love this dog. You know what I mean? And I got this like cute dog music

680
01:57:45,779 --> 01:58:03,319
playing in my ear. Looks very good. He's recovering very well, by the way. He has stitches that have

681
01:58:03,319 --> 01:58:09,420
to come out next week. But he's healing and he's resting. He's doing good. And this is great. This

682
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:18,229
is awesome. Very, very good work. I love the cookies. Who stole the cookie? Thanks for this.

683
01:58:18,229 --> 01:58:35,579
I'm sure we can see who you are. Can you see? Yes you can. There we go. What a good boy. This is

684
01:58:35,579 --> 01:58:55,829
somebody made the giant rat in Spore. It's pretty good. Pretty good work. This is a military land

685
01:58:55,829 --> 01:59:05,050
vehicle. Play Spore. I tried to, remember? I'll have to go back to it one day, but nice job. This

686
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:13,720
is awesome. I like the tail. The tail just looks like a plunger. It might even be a pl-

687
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:19,609
Are there plungers in Spore? They might be. You're looking at us, huh? Is it because we're dentists

688
01:59:20,409 --> 01:59:35,140
of the Outer Worlds stream? Arguably the best part of that game were the dentists that weren't

689
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:49,460
even actually real. We made them up. Fun. This is great, though. Thank you. Fast German versus

690
01:59:49,460 --> 02:00:00,569
Purple Alien. Classic series by one of the green screen video makers. Fast German versus Purple

691
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:08,520
Alien. Always, always trying to one-up each other. I wonder what's next in their adventure if there

692
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:15,189
ever will be a third episode or fourth episode. It's a great series. Maybe one day we'll get

693
02:00:15,189 --> 02:00:28,119
another episode. And look, Fireman's got his seatbelt on. We're about to find out. Not today.

694
02:00:29,479 --> 02:00:41,319
Not today. This is great, though. I love the helicopter. He's safe. Well, he doesn't want

695
02:00:41,319 --> 02:00:51,960
to fall out. He's just a circle. The germacopter, yeah. That magenta and kind of teal look.

696
02:00:51,960 --> 02:01:07,380
Magenta and green. Psycho bubblegum eyes. Choco hair. Sweat check. Gum smile and nose.

697
02:01:08,579 --> 02:01:25,079
Strawberry milk flesh. Stick and melting. Anatomy of a germapop. We made it. I like these things.

698
02:01:26,039 --> 02:01:34,710
The Spider-Man. Sonic the Hedgehog. I love those things. Even if they're weird and they look like

699
02:01:34,710 --> 02:01:45,659
shit and they're gross. I love them. I'm right. I got it. What's the music? This is the Stardew

700
02:01:45,659 --> 02:01:54,539
Valley OST. Playing in the background. Don't rub it. What am I supposed to do? I can't.

701
02:01:55,579 --> 02:02:03,340
Don't touch it. All right. I won't touch it anymore. What am I supposed to do?

702
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:12,359
Wash it. Pour water in it. All right. Well, we're getting. We're almost at the end of the art

703
02:02:12,359 --> 02:02:18,600
section. Then I'm going to. I'm going to flush my eyes. I will rinse my eyes with some water.

704
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:37,560
In about 10 minutes. Very good, though. Jax versus Jerma. I know who wins this one. Jax

705
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:53,939
every time. Always. This is by Rain Loaf. God, I love those old light gun games. They're so fun.

706
02:02:54,659 --> 02:02:59,260
It's just you can't. You have to play them on a TV. And that TV was such a pain in the ass.

707
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:06,550
Once that TV got in that room, I couldn't fucking ever get it out until I moved across the country.

708
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:15,670
It's so fun to play them. I wish I could have captured it better, but you just kind of can't.

709
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:28,380
Delete the Z-Mode. This is awesome, though. It's like painted. It looks like a painting.

710
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:52,779
Floating around the universe. What is that? Is this a drone? Why am I? Watch out for the blades.

711
02:03:52,779 --> 02:03:58,649
This is gonna like slice my arm off. Farmer's Dynasty guy. Oh, OK, OK. Right, right, right,

712
02:03:58,649 --> 02:04:19,930
right. This is the Green Goblin. The Flannel Goblin. The Green Grinner. Yeah, because I'm,

713
02:04:19,930 --> 02:04:23,210
yeah, because we were trying to get it to fly. I remember, yeah. This giant rat.

714
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:36,470
Flannel Farmer comes to New York City to deliver fresh produce. This does look like the front of

715
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:48,699
a cereal box. Like if this is a strawberry, this is a marshmallow sugary cereal. And it could be

716
02:04:48,699 --> 02:05:00,840
called like Flannel Farmerose or something. Tomato cereal. And we need like healthier options. You

717
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:28,199
know, I would I would eat like a vegetable cereal. I wouldn't. Why is this image? I don't understand.

718
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:34,760
Like, is it Duncan? OK, let's see. America runs on Duncan. Dungandonas.com. Rain low.

719
02:05:35,479 --> 02:05:50,220
That's my hand. You just, hey, y'all just got influenced. What do you think about that?

720
02:05:58,970 --> 02:06:07,560
Oh, stop, stop showing it to me. I might order it one time. One dime. Weird. This is good,

721
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:22,810
though. This is very well done. Very well made. This is by Appleshift. A small, incredibly highly

722
02:06:22,810 --> 02:06:40,300
detailed animated short here. Take on me. This is very, very, very good. This probably took,

723
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:46,220
this probably took a very long time to make. Each one of these images is as high detailed

724
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:55,939
as the last one. Thank you, Appleshift. This is fantastic work. Why is he so mad? Wait, what is

725
02:06:55,939 --> 02:07:01,319
this? Why are you clipping this? What is this? Why, why play this right now? This makes no sense. I

726
02:07:01,319 --> 02:07:23,909
don't get it. Sad. So sad. So sad. Oh, right, right, right. This was during Monster Rancher.

727
02:07:23,909 --> 02:07:30,649
Why is this so sad to this part here? Because this is where Monster Rancher 4 is when this happened.

728
02:07:30,649 --> 02:07:39,020
I don't, that game doesn't exist in my brain. It's OK, I get it. All right. All right. It's

729
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:55,930
the last thing you hear before you die. Another animation here. I don't know what this is called.

730
02:07:56,010 --> 02:08:12,600
Jirba is a blocked person. Really good NBA 2K face scan technology, because that's what it looks

731
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:27,140
like when you did that in any of those games. God, this is fucking crazy. Mom did not get me

732
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:42,779
an ice cream cone, except this time I'm a bowling elf. Apologize for this. The Roblox guy? Why?

733
02:08:45,819 --> 02:09:06,949
Good stuff. This is the same image on the screen. This is the wire frame of this. You know what I

734
02:09:06,949 --> 02:09:25,430
mean? This is the same exact image. You look like the guy from Gorillaz. Murdoch? New Gorillaz member.

735
02:09:29,029 --> 02:09:35,659
Yeah, I get some Murdoch vibes from this image I do. Of course I know. That's like my favorite band.

736
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:49,619
Nice stuff. Changing energies a little from here to here. Why is Fireman wanted?

737
02:09:50,420 --> 02:10:15,500
Wait, what? That's not on my screen? No, that's in the image. I don't understand why he's wanted.

738
02:10:16,939 --> 02:10:25,270
Because he killed Snowman. Here's your real face cam.

739
02:10:37,479 --> 02:10:48,039
Don't worry, I'm just winking in this image. I don't know why I thought for one second.

740
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:53,640
That this hair was photoshopped on. I did not think this was real hair for a second. I was

741
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:58,039
like, well, what's wrong with this hair? It's like you like pull the hair from like somebody's ass

742
02:10:58,039 --> 02:11:16,680
and put it on here. This is the only part that's photoshopped. Wearing a wig. Nice work. Oh, look

743
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:45,100
at this. Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken. That's what they were for Halloween. Group costume. Hey,

744
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:51,399
that's easy costume, though. That's cheap. Doesn't cost any money. Well, I mean, yeah,

745
02:11:51,399 --> 02:11:58,199
I mean, yeah, I'm just talking about like this one. It's just, yeah, no, yeah, it did. Now,

746
02:11:58,199 --> 02:12:04,680
this is like a good expensive costume. I just saw the coffee with like a tag, like a sticker that

747
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:12,460
says coffee on it. Well, that was, that was a cheap costume. Guy in chicken suit. Left to right,

748
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:23,399
Jeremy. We go left to right. I love this stuff. It's awesome. I can't believe three German fans

749
02:12:23,399 --> 02:12:38,539
know each other in real life. Say it. I already did. I said coffee, Cheetos, chicken. There you go.

750
02:12:38,539 --> 02:12:44,890
I am, I'll be honest with you, though. I am absolutely shocked and floored and surprised

751
02:12:44,890 --> 02:12:50,869
by the fact that people think this is so interesting or so funny or they've taken it and it's something

752
02:12:50,869 --> 02:12:55,189
that they like to a point that they're going to do a Halloween costume based off. That's just like

753
02:12:55,189 --> 02:13:01,350
fun. Thanks for that. Thank you for thinking that's that funny. Thanks for thinking that

754
02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:10,659
that's that interesting because it's just makes me happy. I'm glad you think it's fun.

755
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:36,949
Jeremy, I just made lobster rolls. Nice. Good work. You got to do something. I got to get,

756
02:13:36,949 --> 02:13:43,989
I got to get in touch with the person responsible for making fireman because it's, you guys,

757
02:13:44,069 --> 02:13:50,250
you guys love fireman. There's got to be some opportunity to do something with fireman.

758
02:13:52,140 --> 02:14:08,039
And not in a T-shirt, something else. Steal the rights from them. No, no. I actually talked to

759
02:14:08,039 --> 02:14:13,560
the person that did that drawing and we already agreed on that it wouldn't just be, all right,

760
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:17,239
thanks for the fucking thing that everybody in the community likes. Bye. Thanks for the money.

761
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:27,800
No, it would be very fair to them. As fair as I could possibly make it. No, because I mean,

762
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:36,659
that is people that just love this shit, you know, make like a flush toy. I'll have to look

763
02:14:36,659 --> 02:14:47,800
into these. That sounds like the mafia. I'm going to make it as fair as I possibly can.

764
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:54,819
Yeah, that does sound like bad. No, no, no, no, no. I've made it fair. I said I've made it,

765
02:14:54,819 --> 02:14:59,539
hold on. That's bad. Yeah, yeah, no, no. I've already talked to him. I've already talked to him

766
02:14:59,539 --> 02:15:05,399
and I made it real clear to him. Made it real clear. That's going to be real fair to them.

767
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:14,250
To let me use that image. Real fair to you. I made it real clear. Jesus. No, I mean, I mean,

768
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:31,800
they're going to get paid. Sounds fucking horrible. Paid. No, paid in money. Paid? No, paid in cash.

769
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:43,340
This is fantastic though. Good work. I love the bright, sunny kind of shiny look. Very good job.

770
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:57,029
It's like they, it's like they can hear us talking. I swear to God, I load these images up

771
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:03,109
and I just go, go, go. I put them in a row. I, I, I've not like gone through all of these.

772
02:16:03,109 --> 02:16:12,600
I load them up. I, I, I don't know. I swear to God. Paid and laundered money. Well, here it is.

773
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:18,439
This is what it might could potentially maybe look like in the future. I don't know. Give us this.

774
02:16:19,319 --> 02:16:34,100
This is not mine. Somebody, this is, somebody owns this. I love it. That's awesome. Iron Man

775
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:57,319
is a currency. Legendary. Yeah. Legend. The grin. Pretty good grin. We can see that who made it,

776
02:16:57,319 --> 02:17:11,030
right? There we go. Say the line. Thanos? No, I'm not Thanos. I never will be Thanos.

777
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:25,989
And why would I want to be Thanos? I want to be, I want to be Spider-Man. This is from Spooky's

778
02:17:26,069 --> 02:17:33,219
Jumpscare Mansion. I hope that's in the game. Is it real? I don't know. Is it

779
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:45,540
really funny if it was? Uh, Vilemi just, just dropped 30 subs, 30 community subs from Vilemi.

780
02:17:47,299 --> 02:18:00,090
Thank you, Vilemi. Huge sub drop from Vilemi. Thank you. Congratulations to those that now

781
02:18:00,090 --> 02:18:12,250
can spam Jirba TV. That's a lot of subs. So many fucking community subs. Team TV. Now I can't delete

782
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:19,780
this. This is what happened. This says, my five-year-old niece loves Fireman so much.

783
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:33,510
She wanted to draw him for you. Ella and Pitcher Cat. I love you, Jirba. Get well soon. Love Ella.

784
02:18:37,909 --> 02:18:48,899
So precious. So precious. I just hope that, I just hope that she doesn't watch when I talk about

785
02:18:48,899 --> 02:19:05,979
shitting my pants. Hope she just sees the Fireman content. Family content. You just ruined a moment

786
02:19:05,979 --> 02:19:19,909
there, but now you have something in common with them. This is so cute. This is adorable.

787
02:19:22,940 --> 02:19:26,940
I'm telling you, Fireman's gonna be worth millions. Fireman's gonna be worth millions.

788
02:19:28,139 --> 02:19:30,459
That's a, that's a, that's a 500 million dollar franchise.

789
02:19:32,459 --> 02:19:46,280
So cute. Thank you. panthaneevadestaxes.org. Nevada Republican Party. I'm fighting for you,

790
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:58,090
Dean Dingus. Imagine if your billboard was, your billboard to run for president.

791
02:19:58,090 --> 02:20:19,299
There's even an Aquaman t-shirt. The Nevada Republican Party. panthaneevadestaxes. Oh my god.

792
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:35,979
This is so stupid. The crying face.

793
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:48,219
That's from one of the DOS streams when we played, what's it called, like Treasure Hunter or something?

794
02:20:48,860 --> 02:21:04,329
Treasure Catcher, Treasure Grab, whatever it is. This is very zoomed in.

795
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:44,020
Video game time. Got my nice slicked back villain hair that I have at conferences. That's a good

796
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:47,700
at teeth. I'm telling you, this is like the third or fourth image that has really good teeth.

797
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:58,969
I like this. I got more hair than that though. It's not fair. I got more hair than that.

798
02:21:59,930 --> 02:22:09,020
It's thinning, but I still have more than that. And finally for the image section,

799
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:15,659
you've reached comedy level two. Jeremy can now tell a knock-knock joke to other sips.

800
02:22:23,159 --> 02:22:26,979
Pretty good. That's it for the art. We're going to move on to the videos now.

801
02:22:28,549 --> 02:22:33,670
And I'm going to go just, let me just rinse my eye because we're going to move on to the video

802
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:39,020
portion. Thank you everybody again for your artwork. That was part one. There's still about

803
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:45,899
20 days or so of stuff that's from the last 20 days. We'll be doing that next week. So thank

804
02:22:45,899 --> 02:22:50,620
you everybody for your contributions, your artwork, your videos, which we're about to see.

805
02:22:51,659 --> 02:22:57,500
And yeah, you guys are fucking talented. I'm glad to showcase talented people. It's a lot of fun.

806
02:22:58,139 --> 02:26:20,600
So it's time for a pee break. Time to wash your eyes and I'll be right back. Hello everybody.

807
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:35,879
We're going to move on to the videos. There are, let's see, 50, 40 to 50, maybe 50 videos,

808
02:26:35,879 --> 02:26:43,979
40, 40 videos. Big bits just came in. Even more money contributed to the stream. Thank you.

809
02:26:43,979 --> 02:26:54,379
Thank you to Chachooty Chabooty for $100 in bits, 10,000 bits. 10,000. Thank you. Grandma,

810
02:26:54,379 --> 02:26:58,059
I love you and your community so much. I never want you to stop. This is the only fraction. This

811
02:26:58,059 --> 02:27:09,510
is only a fraction of the money that you deserve. Oh, let me stop you there for a second. I don't

812
02:27:09,510 --> 02:27:17,319
have any plans on stopping, right? But I've told you guys this before, you know, as long as I'm

813
02:27:17,319 --> 02:27:26,649
having fun, then I'm going to keep doing it. That's it. I'm never going to force myself to

814
02:27:26,649 --> 02:27:30,809
do any of this, you know, because then it becomes, it doesn't become genuine,

815
02:27:31,690 --> 02:27:36,579
but I'm still having fun and I'm going to continue to probably have fun for a long time.

816
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:42,100
But just know, I need to stay interested. I want to stay interested because I don't want to just

817
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:48,299
do it because I want to where I have to. You know what I'm saying? That's like two more weeks of

818
02:27:48,299 --> 02:27:56,149
stream. No, but that's, that means a lot. And then they say, uh, you deserve this for the countless

819
02:27:56,149 --> 02:28:00,469
hours of entertainment you've given me and my friends. I think I have seriously watched ask

820
02:28:00,469 --> 02:28:06,389
nicely for crits and pulling it off with the pump brothers 500 times each. Sorry that I'm not able

821
02:28:06,389 --> 02:28:11,110
to make it here more often. Uh, love you. Wish you the best of luck with all your future projects.

822
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:25,590
PS chat has a nice booty. Well, thank you. Uh, hold on. We'll get away for the car drive by.

823
02:28:27,139 --> 02:28:33,159
Never apologize for not being able to make streams. Some of these go very long and they go deep into

824
02:28:33,159 --> 02:28:39,239
the night and they happen more than a few times a week. So don't feel like you're obligated to

825
02:28:39,239 --> 02:28:44,250
have to be here. I know that's asked a lot. It asks a lot of people to be like, oh yeah, just,

826
02:28:44,809 --> 02:28:52,340
uh, spend 40 plus hours, 30 to 20 to 40 hours a week with me. People have things to do. They

827
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:58,420
have things come up. I don't, you don't have to be here. You don't want to, you speak very fast.

828
02:28:58,420 --> 02:29:06,420
Do I speak really fast? I slow down a little. All right. I'm just all right in the future.

829
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:11,299
I'm going to slow it down. So from here on out, my voice is going to be at a speed. That's minus

830
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:22,020
4% from here on out. Good. But no, thanks a lot to booty. Anybody that's watched the video,

831
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:27,610
like I've made that many times just, it surprises me every time somebody says

832
02:29:29,770 --> 02:29:43,659
thanks for the a hundred bucks back to it. We're going to the video portion now, as you can see,

833
02:29:46,379 --> 02:29:58,540
incorrect. No spoilers up top. I don't want you to see spoilers. This first one is called

834
02:29:58,700 --> 02:30:05,049
stardew valley has to stop playing. All right. Here we go. I'm going to go off cam for these

835
02:30:05,049 --> 02:30:09,290
because I'd rather we experienced it together rather than me have my face covering up a bunch

836
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:15,139
of it. So let's go. It's called animated. I mean, we're talking mainly bug. And when I say we're

837
02:30:15,139 --> 02:30:24,600
talking bugs guys, we're talking like grasshoppers, ants, beetles, spiders. Would you eat a spider?

838
02:30:25,719 --> 02:30:34,340
Good. I wouldn't see like ants are one thing, just regular black ants, not like fire ants,

839
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:44,500
just regular ants. I feel like I wouldn't be that huge of a deal to me. If I knew they were clean,

840
02:30:45,059 --> 02:30:50,579
it was like they were three doctors and two scientists that were standing around in a

841
02:30:50,579 --> 02:30:54,250
circle around me while I was about to eat it. And they all the all of them are just like,

842
02:30:54,250 --> 02:30:59,059
yeah, that's delicious. You go ahead. The nutritional value is off the charts. And it's

843
02:30:59,059 --> 02:31:08,069
great. It's better for you than eating an apple. Maybe. I don't know. One of those scientists

844
02:31:08,069 --> 02:31:23,239
says it might not be a good idea. I'm it's gone. All right. Where is this supposed to be? Wait,

845
02:31:23,239 --> 02:31:45,450
what? I mean, we're talking. What happened here? Oh, it's during that was a long time ago. Wait,

846
02:31:45,450 --> 02:31:54,059
that was a very, very long time ago. I thought I didn't I talk about this like, like, not even

847
02:31:54,059 --> 02:32:10,700
two months ago. Holy shit. What a weirdo. On to the next one. That was pretty good, though.

848
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:19,180
That was pretty good animation. Wait, hold on. Is it another one? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

849
02:32:19,180 --> 02:32:33,959
There's another one. I'm confused here. Wait a minute. Mainly bug. When I say we're talking

850
02:32:33,959 --> 02:32:41,239
bugs, guys, we're talking what is there another one of these like grasshoppers, beetles, spiders.

851
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:52,659
Would you eat a spider? I wouldn't. Why is this coming back? Why is this coming back?

852
02:32:52,659 --> 02:32:59,620
Is your one and five teaser animation? Really? But when I say we're talking bugs, guys, we're

853
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:17,350
talking my ears. That was no spoilers. No spoilers. All right. That was this one's called

854
02:33:17,350 --> 02:33:31,049
Jerma dream. Siri, take a note. No, no. What's the note? It's not a cave.

855
02:33:33,299 --> 02:33:40,139
Sharing two sticks with a guy, some homeless guy threw up in his mouth. Mickey Mouse comes in

856
02:33:41,219 --> 02:33:57,209
and drains all my battery from my iPod. I kiss him. Siri. I think this is a dream thing.

857
02:33:58,170 --> 02:34:02,250
I think that's a dream that somebody did somebody have that dream or

858
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:14,620
I don't know. Take a note. No, no. What's the note? It's not a cave. Sharing two sticks with

859
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:22,889
a guy, some homeless guy threw up in his mouth. Mickey Mouse comes in and drains all my battery

860
02:34:22,889 --> 02:34:30,010
from my iPod. I kiss him. You were talking about keeping a dream journal and how fucking weird it

861
02:34:30,010 --> 02:34:46,389
is. All right. Yeah, I see. I feel you. This one is called Jerma in Star Wars. I feel like I'm in

862
02:34:46,389 --> 02:35:06,180
fucking Star Wars. I ain't slowing down for nothing. Oh, what? You just put the V. It's just the music.

863
02:35:07,059 --> 02:35:23,430
I think I just ripped out the code. Stormtrooper. All right. Moving right along. This one's called

864
02:35:24,149 --> 02:35:32,469
1985. The ideal set up by the party was something huge, terrible and glittering.

865
02:35:32,469 --> 02:35:39,100
A world of steel and concrete with machines and terrifying weapons. A nation of warriors

866
02:35:39,100 --> 02:35:50,469
marching for the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually worked the same face.

867
02:35:52,549 --> 02:36:02,969
Mike Tyson, the hardest puncher ever. Magic and punch in the face by Mike Tyson.

868
02:36:03,690 --> 02:36:12,120
This is awesome. Machines and terrifying weapons. A nation of warriors and fanatics marching

869
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:20,620
forward in the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually worked.

870
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:24,840
Except for these guys here. Those are the two main characters.

871
02:36:32,549 --> 02:36:43,379
Jesus Christ. This one's called the Jerma Showdown. I think we may have seen this

872
02:36:43,379 --> 02:36:47,299
at the end of a stream. I think I put it on one time, but it's probably worth seeing again. Maybe

873
02:36:47,299 --> 02:37:19,639
we haven't. Maybe something similar. You're going down. You're going down. This is so stupid.

874
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:21,079
What a loser.

875
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:39,780
Wait, it was an ambassador body shot? An ambassador body shot. Holy shit, that's fucking funny.

876
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:56,200
This one's called Just Waters of Nazareth. Whatever that means.

877
02:38:10,889 --> 02:38:33,850
Pretty good. Pretty good. My first encounter with Jerma. My first encounter with him.

878
02:38:34,729 --> 02:38:56,709
This is what it looks like if somebody were to make my whole face out of paper.

879
02:38:57,909 --> 02:39:04,360
My entire body is made out of very delicate paper and it's your mother packs it into your backpack,

880
02:39:05,079 --> 02:39:08,680
but doesn't really put the care necessary into making sure it doesn't get ruined.

881
02:39:09,879 --> 02:39:18,260
And then you take this out in class and you're like, mom, what the? Mom, why did you put it in

882
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:22,500
here? I told you I wanted to carry it. And she was like, you're not carrying that. It's too delicate.

883
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:34,920
And then you have to have everybody see this. So you're implying that you're my homework.

884
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:45,350
In a sense. In a sense. This is called a crude pre-stream thesis. This is a song.

885
02:39:45,909 --> 02:39:57,370
This is from Neon Genesis Evangelion, but it's a custom song. Let's see. Let's hear it.

886
02:40:12,229 --> 02:40:17,239
I pronounced it correctly. Of course it is.

887
02:40:30,100 --> 02:40:40,520
So it is custom lyrics too. All right. Let's see it. Let's hear it, man.

888
02:41:51,579 --> 02:42:04,940
That was awesome. That was awesome. Y'all didn't want to give that one a chance until it got started.

889
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:26,059
Gift this person a sub for crying out loud. Nice work. That was really, really, really good.

890
02:42:26,860 --> 02:42:41,959
There it is. Somebody did it. Clap, clap, clap, clap. Collapse all around. This one is called

891
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:48,440
German Wars, a Star Wars one. Hopefully there's not. All right. If you've never seen Star Wars

892
02:42:48,440 --> 02:42:53,079
before, there might be a Star Wars clip in here. If you've never seen Star Wars, I guess it might

893
02:42:53,079 --> 02:42:58,700
be a Star Wars clip. Am I gonna? Should I? Can I show this one? I think it's just like a joke,

894
02:42:58,700 --> 02:43:02,379
right? All right. The Star Wars coming up. Here comes a Star Wars one.

895
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:25,420
Oh, this is like.

896
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:52,780
Is that a grenade?

897
02:43:52,780 --> 02:44:03,379
Red group, go group. All fighters follow me. I told you they'd do it.

898
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:14,889
I'm going down. Here goes nothing. I'm going down. No, we're not. We're fine.

899
02:44:26,780 --> 02:44:48,379
Oh, shit. Sorry. Sorry. Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.

900
02:44:48,379 --> 02:44:51,180
Intensify the forward. I don't want anything to get through.

901
02:44:51,180 --> 02:45:08,920
Wait, hold on. You can't just end it like that. You can't just end it like that.

902
02:45:28,979 --> 02:45:39,239
I fall twice. Okay, my stomach hurts. What happened? Look at the title.

903
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:46,040
German wars return to the two minute max runtime. This is going to be like five minutes long,

904
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:56,840
so I had to make some big adjustments laughing. That's the best part. That's seriously the best

905
02:45:56,840 --> 02:46:13,610
fucking part. Oh, my God. Link link. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You want you definitely. I love porn tabs.

906
02:46:14,940 --> 02:46:23,510
Oh, man. That was funny. That was by Coco Jam. Nice work, dude. Seriously. All right. This one's

907
02:46:23,510 --> 02:46:30,540
called huge German shitpost, so I'm ready. I'm ready to mute this one. I got my finger on it.

908
02:46:32,379 --> 02:47:28,659
Vaude. He was going to skip. I mean, I'm just standing around. Did I just lose my vaude?

909
02:47:28,659 --> 02:47:36,700
Did my vaude just get fucking crushed? I mean, the title, it is titled huge German shitpost.

910
02:47:36,700 --> 02:47:46,229
Did I lose the vaude? All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Moving on. Moving on.

911
02:47:46,229 --> 02:47:52,229
Moving on. Moving on. Moving on. This is German the hedgehog 2019 movie teaser.

912
02:48:16,870 --> 02:48:28,459
This summer. It's pretty good. Quality shitpost. Yeah. This is called. This is called

913
02:48:28,459 --> 02:48:35,750
German destroys the cutest thing ever. And you have the money to spend. I already know what these.

914
02:48:36,790 --> 02:48:40,229
I already know this video. I already know how this video ends.

915
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:47,540
You know, we've all we've seen the video. All of us have seen this video now, right? All right.

916
02:48:47,540 --> 02:48:53,059
Listen, and you have the money to spend. I would get rid of one of these. I would make a statement.

917
02:48:54,420 --> 02:48:58,979
And if you want to hear what I'm talking about here, I'm talking about a real state.

918
02:49:06,340 --> 02:49:12,600
What would that be the cutest? What would this be the cutest fucking thing you've ever seen?

919
02:49:15,850 --> 02:49:32,420
My god, this is called a rant wasp and the man rant wasp and the man.

920
02:49:33,700 --> 02:49:43,129
So I think the thing about, um, I think eating going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.

921
02:49:44,329 --> 02:49:48,809
Oh shit. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait till he lands. Wait till he lands.

922
02:49:49,530 --> 02:50:06,620
Okay. He landed up in smoke. The roles have been reversed. Yes, they have no.

923
02:50:06,620 --> 02:50:09,739
Who cares if I even show spoilers? You know, there's no spoilers to see.

924
02:50:11,319 --> 02:50:17,719
Uh, we, uh, this is worth showing again. It is. This was shown at the very end of the stream one

925
02:50:17,719 --> 02:50:23,559
night and it's fucking hilarious. So this is the, uh, this is a wager fulfilled pepper.

926
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:39,219
I got time. No, no, please. No, I'm trying to turn it. No, I'm trying to turn it. If I go into the

927
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:45,059
black hole one more time, I'm I'll eat a ghost pepper on screen. You know what I mean? Like

928
02:50:45,059 --> 02:50:49,540
that's the kind of shit I need to make sure I don't do. Wouldn't that destroy my stomach? Yeah. So I

929
02:50:49,540 --> 02:51:43,299
better not go in the black hole. This has to go up. This has to go up. Uh, this next one.

930
02:51:44,819 --> 02:52:12,840
Whatever. Just play it. Play it. Oh no, my C drive. C, Jeremy downloads. Oh fuck. There is no sound.

931
02:52:13,799 --> 02:52:32,409
What do you think this is? Yeah. Some mad man made this and also made this.

932
02:52:33,450 --> 02:52:43,379
I'm not sure whether to be happy or to be very upset about this,

933
02:52:44,579 --> 02:52:53,500
but now it exists in front of a green screen. So you can do things like this.

934
02:53:06,379 --> 02:53:52,819
There's the trumpet or whatever, a horn, some kind of horn. She's a stupid streamer.

935
02:53:53,940 --> 02:53:59,620
Jay Bum Bum said that you, how did you get that name? I can't believe that. That's the real Jay

936
02:53:59,620 --> 02:54:08,389
Bum Bum that just said that. But yeah, now people can do shit like that. This one is called

937
02:54:09,350 --> 02:54:26,790
Psycho Streamer Destroys Cybertruck. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Oh my fucking God. Well, oh,

938
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:39,459
maybe that was a little too hard. Should we try on the mirror? It didn't go through.

939
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:43,860
That's a plus side. Okay. It's beauty.

940
02:55:09,940 --> 02:55:11,059
Maybe that was a little too hard.

941
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:25,989
Okay. It's beauty.

942
02:55:31,989 --> 02:55:50,229
This is like, this might be one of my new favorite videos. It's just, it's just so stupid.

943
02:55:51,350 --> 02:55:58,489
It's just, you find the perfect places to put these stupid things. Is it better than the

944
02:55:58,489 --> 02:56:05,510
baseball? No, nothing ever will be. But that's still, that's still fun. Slate me. That was so

945
02:56:05,590 --> 02:56:12,840
fucking stupid. I love it. This one is called Fireman's First Christmas. If you remember,

946
02:56:13,879 --> 02:56:43,750
I believe this is the same animator from last time. Nobody say any swears.

947
02:56:44,549 --> 02:57:22,790
There's a five-year-old that's going to watch this. That's a little too hard for me.

948
02:57:42,329 --> 02:58:14,600
It's snowman. Their first meeting. Hey, that's not very funny snowman.

949
02:58:15,479 --> 02:58:35,750
They're going to keep, it's a never-ending conflict. The unstoppable object versus the

950
02:58:35,750 --> 02:59:08,389
immovable firepower, whatever it is. Why am I outside? What am I doing out here? Look,

951
02:59:08,389 --> 02:59:58,280
they're friends. They found a way. Uh-oh. Do I get out of here? Help me. Do I not have a bed?

952
02:59:58,280 --> 03:00:14,950
Look, it's Otto. I'm sleeping. What? I'm sleeping. I'm sleeping.

953
03:00:21,819 --> 03:00:39,129
Fireman's First Christmas. That was so cute. Cast, Jeremy Albertson as me,

954
03:00:39,129 --> 03:00:45,049
Fireman as fireman. Look at this dude. Snowman as snowman and sleeping dog is Otto.

955
03:00:46,010 --> 03:01:08,659
What is going on there? That's not my face, right? That is not my face. It's not. No,

956
03:01:08,659 --> 03:01:15,860
it is not. That's not my face. That's somebody else's face on my body or something. That's not

957
03:01:15,860 --> 03:01:20,360
my face. It's not real. I know it's not real because I know what my face looks like.

958
03:01:22,969 --> 03:01:29,290
That was fantastic. We're a little late. Christmas was a little while ago, but

959
03:01:30,250 --> 03:01:36,090
uh, Kitchicat, that was again, fantastic. Very, very, very well made. Very cute.

960
03:01:39,670 --> 03:01:45,370
We all love it. Coming up next, this is called Jirva at the Carnival.

961
03:01:46,250 --> 03:01:59,139
Do we have audio on this thing? Oh, that was loud. Try it again. Do we have audio on this thing?

962
03:01:59,139 --> 03:02:22,790
Let's find out. Does it have audio? Can you hear it? I got, I have no reaction to what just happened.

963
03:02:22,790 --> 03:02:26,549
I was initially going to start laughing, but then I was just like, oh, I, I, I don't,

964
03:02:26,549 --> 03:02:46,250
I have no reaction to this. It was just too much. Okay. The, the fact that it's stuck,

965
03:02:46,250 --> 03:02:59,860
it stops when I turn around and it tails off killing me. Oh, that's fucking funny.

966
03:03:00,819 --> 03:03:07,500
What else we got? This is called Jirva Loses His Sanity. Here we go.

967
03:03:18,790 --> 03:03:58,549
I'm confused. All right. That was called

968
03:03:59,670 --> 03:04:04,760
Insane or whatever it was. Um, have we seen this one before? I think we may have seen this.

969
03:04:05,719 --> 03:04:09,260
It's definitely worth showing again. It's another Star Wars one. Don't sue me.

970
03:04:34,090 --> 03:04:55,659
Oscar? Oh, I get the Oscar. Another Star Wars one incoming. I hope you guys have,

971
03:04:55,659 --> 03:05:09,989
I hope you guys have seen the movie Star Wars franchise. Do we have audio on this thing?

972
03:05:09,989 --> 03:05:27,829
Let's find out. That was a, that was a good clip. I liked that one a lot. It was very good. That

973
03:05:27,829 --> 03:05:37,659
was really good. I liked that one. Nice work. Any more Star Wars? Now this is a Jirma's house tour

974
03:05:38,219 --> 03:05:43,500
and already from the first frame here, this is accurate. This is very scary. How accurate this

975
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:49,979
is. I like this. They say, I hope you like it. By the way, there is no Jirma is small joke here.

976
03:05:50,620 --> 03:05:55,180
The doors are big because I can't do proportions. The bed is a reference to a stream.

977
03:05:59,750 --> 03:06:11,700
Let's find out. By the way, there's no short joke here. This room, this looks exactly like the room.

978
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:36,840
The music too. How'd you get the music in here? Kim, yeah. Let's see if it's accurate. This is

979
03:06:37,399 --> 03:06:51,399
it's 100% accurate. It's my green screen room. What else? Where else we going?

980
03:06:52,440 --> 03:07:07,020
Hang a right and this brings us to bedroom. Okay. Hold on a minute. Pause the video.

981
03:07:09,079 --> 03:07:13,079
This is like kind of, this is a joke, but how awesome would this be?

982
03:07:13,959 --> 03:07:37,860
This would be incredible. It's a normal bed. Now let's not look at the door. This is actually

983
03:07:37,860 --> 03:08:01,159
really well made. Toilet. Am I going to piss? I'm going to have to close it if I piss.

984
03:08:02,040 --> 03:08:09,340
I like, I would like that. I would like that. I really would. That painting, the paint job.

985
03:08:15,819 --> 03:08:22,329
I want a weird ass room. You know what I mean? Eventually I just, I just want to have

986
03:08:22,329 --> 03:08:34,010
just some strange ass rooms that have wild paints on them and fun. That was really well made. Nice

987
03:08:34,010 --> 03:08:42,440
job. This one says this is secret dog ending is what this one's called. Secret dog ending.

988
03:08:43,239 --> 03:09:05,719
Let's see what it is. There you go. Auto spotted. Bad dog. Bad dog.

989
03:09:06,680 --> 03:09:32,620
Uh, this is very, I like the, the, uh, I want to see it again. I love the like,

990
03:09:32,620 --> 03:09:43,540
hi everybody. He's like sad. All right. Let's watch it. There you go. Auto spotted. Bad dog.

991
03:09:47,479 --> 03:10:10,420
Bad dog. That was, that was ridiculous. This is how I attack. That was a Garfield scream.

992
03:10:11,459 --> 03:10:17,959
Holy shit. That was a Garfield scream. No, no, no, no. That's, that's, that's Tom from Tom and Jerry.

993
03:10:18,200 --> 03:10:23,479
Right, right. Not Garfield. Garfield didn't scream. Since when does Garfield scream? Okay.

994
03:10:23,479 --> 03:10:28,040
This one's called, uh, shut the fuck up. I'm listening to Bratz birthday mixtape.

995
03:10:42,040 --> 03:11:01,260
Oh, there it is. There's like the guy. I really like lick my mouth every 15

996
03:11:01,260 --> 03:11:13,420
seconds. Oh, I need lip balm. I got these dry ass lips. This is, uh, I've been showing this

997
03:11:13,420 --> 03:11:18,700
before, but I don't think I've ever shown this on stream. This is called, I can't even save in this

998
03:11:18,700 --> 03:11:50,360
game anymore. I don't, I don't really know the context of this, but he tries to fight him. And

999
03:11:50,360 --> 03:11:59,219
all right. Like what's, what are these auto automatic fucking videos? Must watch. Yeah,

1000
03:11:59,219 --> 03:12:04,440
I ain't watching your shit. So what, what's that? What's that a reference to? What's, what's that?

1001
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:08,840
I can't save in this game anymore. What's this? Is that like a CS go gun game or something?

1002
03:12:09,639 --> 03:12:15,540
I'm not going to watch that. I don't want to watch that. We've got like fucking 15 more videos.

1003
03:12:16,500 --> 03:12:29,190
It's a famous bunny hopping video and see if CS go. You can save your items at the end of the round.

1004
03:12:29,190 --> 03:12:38,219
Oh, it's a currency thing. Ah, I see. I see. By the way, the video has 300,000 views.

1005
03:12:39,180 --> 03:12:52,280
Currency thing. All right. This one's called parks and recreation, but it's German

1006
03:12:53,079 --> 03:12:59,690
parks and recreations, but apparently it's, it's me. No, careful.

1007
03:13:33,420 --> 03:13:37,420
People are still ending these videos with the earth exploding from rat moving.

1008
03:13:38,299 --> 03:13:47,860
I think I've said this before. That's the easiest way to end a video. It's so simple. If you're just

1009
03:13:47,860 --> 03:13:54,500
like, how the fuck do I end this video? Easy. Just have the earth explode. There's that's why I did

1010
03:13:54,500 --> 03:14:03,020
it. It was just, I don't know how to end this. I don't want to do that much more work. So let's

1011
03:14:03,020 --> 03:14:08,940
the earth explodes. Okay. I really love reading a book. Yes. That's another way to end. It's just

1012
03:14:08,940 --> 03:14:16,170
ways to make it so you don't have to do any more work. I think this, if this is what I think it is,

1013
03:14:16,170 --> 03:14:28,459
I'm shocked and kind of, I can't believe it. I played fear. I played fear a couple of months

1014
03:14:28,459 --> 03:14:34,700
ago and one of the things that I was doing was going around because just ADHD. Like I just

1015
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:44,950
couldn't help it. I was breaking fire extinguishers and I think I mentioned to clip every time I hit

1016
03:14:44,950 --> 03:14:57,260
a fire extinguisher. I think somebody did it. Thermosphere of fire extinguishers.

1017
03:14:58,739 --> 03:15:16,059
I don't know about this one. Can I use this? Is it explode? Yep. All right. Here we go. Three times

1018
03:15:16,059 --> 03:15:34,170
bigger. This is going to give me a headache. I don't know. For some reason I thought I had to

1019
03:15:34,170 --> 03:15:42,629
use that. How is it already broken? Impossible. What? Oh, this is where I came from. Right. Thank

1020
03:15:42,629 --> 03:15:49,129
God. And that's, you guys wonder why I'm doing that. Why does he keep breaking those? Well,

1021
03:15:49,129 --> 03:16:00,360
because it's a breadcrumb trip and I know where I've been. There's nothing in there. There's

1022
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:05,079
nothing in there. What are you doing? Oh, I don't, I can't, do I have him in a full retreat?

1023
03:16:11,290 --> 03:16:17,290
All right. Guys, when Dwayne the rock Johnson is standing there and he's like flexing in a

1024
03:16:17,290 --> 03:16:22,729
mirror, just like looking huge and awesome. And somebody comes up behind him and like grabs him.

1025
03:16:22,729 --> 03:16:44,809
He's going to go, you can't, nobody looks cool that way. It's true. Oh, here it is.

1026
03:16:45,610 --> 03:16:48,809
I haven't. Okay. This is the electric. That's the electric. Oh no.

1027
03:16:58,729 --> 03:17:11,209
I love this game and stay down. I cannot believe you did this. I feel so much more at home.

1028
03:17:13,370 --> 03:17:20,489
I can't believe you shattered his computer. So he freaks out. You know, he's had that monitor for

1029
03:17:20,489 --> 03:17:37,059
like 15 years. Fun thing. It's a really cool thing. Why am I closed? Oh, it's a different day. I did

1030
03:17:37,059 --> 03:17:44,420
it over two days. I haven't been in here yet. Right. Why did I not break that? I should have

1031
03:17:44,420 --> 03:17:53,899
fucking known. Really? That's the point. That's why I'm doing this. See, cause I know that I was

1032
03:17:53,899 --> 03:18:04,040
there. Missed lore. Missed lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip

1033
03:18:04,040 --> 03:18:12,700
lore. Almost two more minutes of this. This guy's doing a really great job of doing the random voice

1034
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:19,260
lines that play when you spawn for the first time in a league of legends game as a champion.

1035
03:18:22,700 --> 03:18:30,170
Fucked up medical stuff. You should have seen what the guy did. He flew up. I, I, the guy was

1036
03:18:30,170 --> 03:18:35,049
going this way and then he got magnetized his face to the wall and blood splattered. He's going

1037
03:18:35,049 --> 03:18:42,969
to be like, what the fuck are you talking about? I'm lost. I'm so lost. I don't know what any of this

1038
03:18:42,969 --> 03:18:46,809
means. I thought this was like a Google satellite image of like a warehouse and roads and stuff. I

1039
03:18:46,809 --> 03:18:55,719
was like, wait, where is that? Holy shit. How many times did I actually do this? It's just available

1040
03:18:55,719 --> 03:19:03,940
for me. So I do it. It's just a, it's just a thing that I know. You know what I mean? It's routine

1041
03:19:05,430 --> 03:19:10,629
in a game with scary jump scares and all kinds of weird fucked up enemies. This is routine for

1042
03:19:10,629 --> 03:19:28,020
me. It's comfortable. I can't believe I used to do that shit. Embarrassing. I remember when I

1043
03:19:28,020 --> 03:19:49,510
thought that was fun. Memories. It's like looking at an old photo. Should I just give this to the

1044
03:19:49,510 --> 03:19:56,500
doctor? You know, like should I feel like this is just, this should be in like the, in the

1045
03:19:56,500 --> 03:20:10,790
folder of stuff I bring. I mean, seriously, that was crap. I can't believe you did it.

1046
03:20:10,790 --> 03:20:24,729
That's, you had to go through like, what? 17, 16 hours of stuff to find it. God damn. Well,

1047
03:20:24,729 --> 03:20:33,700
we got it. This is Pokemon gold, Pokemon gold, silver crystal battle, the giant enemy spider.

1048
03:20:34,500 --> 03:20:39,940
This actually is a music file, but there is some video to go with it. I bet you can never guess

1049
03:20:39,940 --> 03:20:47,319
what it is. See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle of this,

1050
03:20:48,520 --> 03:21:46,469
the giant enemy spider. Remember when I did all this? Feels bad, man. Old YouTube. Yeah, you know,

1051
03:21:48,090 --> 03:21:54,170
memories, you know, when you're like looking at an old photograph.

1052
03:21:54,809 --> 03:22:16,520
How long can you keep it up for? How long can you do it for? It's like, it's like passing an old

1053
03:22:16,520 --> 03:22:43,620
fire extinguisher. This is where it's from. I've never played this game. Why would I have that in

1054
03:22:43,620 --> 03:22:56,139
my head for any reason? Probably Smash Brothers. Yeah, definitely Smash Brothers. This is where

1055
03:22:56,139 --> 03:23:16,979
they got the Pokemon song. This is where they got that Pokemon song, you know? Remix? Well, I mean,

1056
03:23:16,979 --> 03:23:25,579
I know, I mean, of course it's a remix. It's really good, though. Very, very fucking great job.

1057
03:23:26,790 --> 03:23:35,020
Giant enemy spider. This is a remake. Yeah, what do you think? This is more music here. This is,

1058
03:23:35,020 --> 03:23:40,379
well, technically kind of. This is Sea Shanty 2, but it's German's pirate marching band.

1059
03:24:02,969 --> 03:24:34,780
I never played RuneScape before. I know a lot of people love it. I never played it.

1060
03:24:35,819 --> 03:24:41,510
That was, I think, I don't know what, what's the, hold on, let's go over here for a second.

1061
03:24:42,149 --> 03:24:49,479
I mean, I know this part because, I mean, like LOL, right? But what happens here? What is,

1062
03:24:49,479 --> 03:24:54,520
what's going on in this image here? Am I not, is this character not supposed to be here?

1063
03:24:55,479 --> 03:25:04,020
Does it get killed by a dwarf? All right. Can someone explain RuneScape to me in a small,

1064
03:25:04,819 --> 03:25:12,459
like three words? Is it hard? Do you, when you die, you're dead? It's, it's RuneScape.

1065
03:25:12,459 --> 03:25:21,180
You see like people die in RuneScape and it's a huge problem or something. You lose all your

1066
03:25:21,180 --> 03:25:32,229
items when you die. Okay. Stream RuneScape. I don't know if I want to do that. You just literally

1067
03:25:32,229 --> 03:25:39,860
respawn. Oh, well, I always thought it was something, this is hardcore or something.

1068
03:25:44,200 --> 03:25:51,110
No, I don't have any, but I can't get into like another MMO. No way. You respawn, but without,

1069
03:25:51,110 --> 03:26:04,100
so it's like Minecraft. Okay. I get it. Come on. Next is, this is, this is a one second video.

1070
03:26:04,100 --> 03:26:07,139
I don't even know how you get a one second video. You can upload it to YouTube, but here it is.

1071
03:26:07,219 --> 03:26:21,190
Jerma eats a lunchable. Good. Jerma get mad, then do stunt.

1072
03:26:38,860 --> 03:26:40,219
What on earth just happened?

1073
03:26:53,270 --> 03:26:57,530
Jerma get mad, then do stunt. I get it. I guess it is just the title, huh?

1074
03:27:00,569 --> 03:27:08,389
Regular show. Changed clothes, mid throw. Oh man. These are, I fucking love these.

1075
03:27:08,389 --> 03:27:17,260
This is a new Bill Crazee video. Another Bill Crazee interpretation of footage.

1076
03:27:40,340 --> 03:27:44,500
I'm going to see how long I can last. It's going to hurt like a bitch. You know what I mean?

1077
03:27:59,799 --> 03:28:13,450
I love all the, all the Gary the fuck up videos and Bill Crazee videos because

1078
03:28:14,409 --> 03:28:18,729
they're all a little different somehow. Sometimes it's a pool. Sometimes it's a

1079
03:28:19,290 --> 03:28:24,649
beach. Sometimes it's a bathtub. They're always just slightly different to a point where I like

1080
03:28:24,649 --> 03:28:36,520
watching them. I can't just let a video get to the end because I have ADD and I have to like,

1081
03:28:36,520 --> 03:28:42,870
I have to get it right before it ends. I piss off so many of my friends if I watch videos and stuff.

1082
03:28:42,870 --> 03:28:46,870
I'm just like, oh, it's done. I'm done. I got to click it too. I know a lot of people do that shit.

1083
03:28:47,510 --> 03:28:53,110
I'm one of them. It's called Jerma Boulder. We'd best leave till the weather's better. The rain

1084
03:28:53,110 --> 03:29:19,530
loosened some of this rock. I think it's Boulder wanting us to go away. I missed that somehow.

1085
03:29:21,850 --> 03:29:38,229
Is that supposed to be from the AI dungeon stream? Here is a mad tyrant Jerma kills his subjects.

1086
03:29:57,540 --> 03:30:02,020
Everyone's kind of baby. So this, wait, does that mean that I've been killing babies?

1087
03:30:02,579 --> 03:30:10,440
I killed them all. Is that what that means? And not just the men, but oh shit, I've been killing

1088
03:30:10,440 --> 03:30:20,620
actual babies this whole time. I think we saw this one. My favorite part is the bonkabonkabonkash.

1089
03:30:20,620 --> 03:30:41,690
oh here's another and we have made it to the mostly music well there's a couple of videos

1090
03:30:42,569 --> 03:31:57,180

1093
03:32:14,940 --> 03:32:26,489

1155
03:47:04,459 --> 03:47:18,440
we're essentially just gonna go and tick stuff off the list when is the green screen after i get

1156
03:47:19,159 --> 03:47:27,700
a shot of nerve blocking steroids into my ribs and i don't have a time frame for that yet because

1157
03:47:27,700 --> 03:47:40,379
that's it's apparently what i'm gonna have to do if you if you missed if you don't know what

1158
03:47:40,379 --> 03:47:43,420
i'm talking about i was going to go back in front of the green screen because obviously

1159
03:47:44,459 --> 03:47:48,780
oh let me just change the scenes here because this is the end um i was gonna go back in front

1160
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:56,139
of the green screen and do six more hours of green screen content right just because this

1161
03:47:56,139 --> 03:48:03,659
this shit is so funny you guys come up with so much stuff and it's and even still a full year

1162
03:48:03,659 --> 03:48:12,520
later these clips are still used and still put in funny places that you guys have just have you just

1163
03:48:12,520 --> 03:48:21,159
it never stops so i wanted to give way more footage for you guys to use but i've come down

1164
03:48:21,159 --> 03:48:27,620
with a strange medical condition where my core kind of around my all in the middle of my ribs

1165
03:48:27,620 --> 03:48:34,420
in the back uh in my spine and back and ribs and shit it hurts and my range of motion is limited

1166
03:48:35,139 --> 03:48:39,860
i mean i can still move around i'm fine but i can't like throw my arms around and fucking

1167
03:48:39,860 --> 03:48:44,500
run around and jump and land like i did my range of motion is smaller it's tighter now

1168
03:48:45,639 --> 03:48:50,440
and we're still trying to figure out exactly what's going on but they think that i have to get

1169
03:48:51,079 --> 03:48:54,680
i think i have costochondritis i mean i have a hernia which i've said before

1170
03:48:55,399 --> 03:48:59,879
but i might also have costochondritis which is inflammation in your rib cage and this really

1171
03:48:59,879 --> 03:49:03,559
you don't do anything to treat it there's there is no treatment it's just do a thing that makes

1172
03:49:03,559 --> 03:49:10,780
your body not hurt anymore which is steroids like an injection in your like ribs but i will cross

1173
03:49:10,780 --> 03:49:21,590
that bridge when i have to but i'm good i don't think it's not like every day i can't walk or

1174
03:49:21,590 --> 03:49:27,750
anything i'm fine completely but turning my body more than probably 30 or 40 degrees to the left

1175
03:49:27,750 --> 03:49:36,889
or right ah it hurts but that's the reason why i haven't done it yet kind of waiting on to get

1176
03:49:36,889 --> 03:49:42,700
all that i want 2020 is the year where i want to get truly back to health because i have been no

1177
03:49:42,700 --> 03:49:48,780
it's not that i have been eating unhealthy or being unhealthy my body has decided to at this stage

1178
03:49:49,579 --> 03:49:56,860
the last like year and a half or so is to sort of revolt so 2020 i really want to get healthy

1179
03:49:56,860 --> 03:50:03,979
again whether that's you know find treatment for the back and rib problems i want to get back into

1180
03:50:03,979 --> 03:50:09,819
being healthy and not necessarily oh i'm gonna go to the gym every day but just not kind of feel

1181
03:50:09,819 --> 03:50:17,129
like bumpy two three days a week you know i mean if that makes any sense but uh let's do the bits

1182
03:50:19,430 --> 03:50:22,709
thanks for watching again the community content nights are always really really fun for me

1183
03:50:23,430 --> 03:50:28,069

1184
03:50:29,270 --> 03:50:38,260
artwork that you guys do a lot of talented funny people here and i love showcasing it and each one

1185
03:50:38,260 --> 03:50:44,760
of these is the third time we've done this well technically fifth time we've done this where my

1186
03:50:44,760 --> 03:50:54,540
face hurts from laughing at at least five to ten of these you know what i mean drink water i drink

1187
03:50:54,540 --> 03:51:01,180
a lot of water don't worry it's not the water but hey let's go back fitting gave 250 quick guys

1188
03:51:01,180 --> 03:51:07,620
do a hype train the hype train did happen i have increased the difficulty on it and if i'm gonna

1189
03:51:07,620 --> 03:51:13,260
bring it up to its maximum we'll see what happens after that but i appreciate it nonetheless

1190
03:51:14,629 --> 03:51:19,190
ocean dweller thanks for 250 germany you made it harder but people still kind of do it we're

1191
03:51:19,190 --> 03:51:23,829
just spending more money now the smart move is to make it super easy so people don't waste

1192
03:51:23,829 --> 03:51:32,520
as much and it's over faster just make it like five dollars so if we get to level five instantly

1193
03:51:33,479 --> 03:51:42,250
something about that is funny but i feel like it would be annoying after a couple days but i'll

1194
03:51:42,250 --> 03:51:50,340
try it i'll try that next room yeah i'll make it like five bucks till i get to level five or

1195
03:51:50,340 --> 03:52:07,540
something or i might just turn it off you know it doesn't have to be there but back on soy and

1196
03:52:07,540 --> 03:52:14,500
mcdonald's and fast food i don't really i don't really like soy i don't like soy milk i don't

1197
03:52:14,500 --> 03:52:21,079
really eat soy products i'm not a big soy fan i don't really take that much dairy besides a

1198
03:52:21,079 --> 03:52:29,129
little cheese every now and then and some yogurt but i drink almond milk i have replaced almond

1199
03:52:29,129 --> 03:52:38,969
milk 100 with everything else that is dairy wait you're you're you're a chat if you drink almond

1200
03:52:38,969 --> 03:52:49,530
milk is that how it works oh shout out to the 4 000 doctors in the chat yeah shout out to all

1201
03:52:49,530 --> 03:53:01,290
these doctors uh but yeah potion dweller i'll probably just get rid of it it's a fun thing

1202
03:53:01,290 --> 03:53:05,770
to do maybe i'll turn it on every once in a while but i'm probably not gonna have it on every day

1203
03:53:05,770 --> 03:53:10,090
we've been it's been around for about a week i'll probably i'll turn on like the hype train like

1204
03:53:10,090 --> 03:53:14,409
once every few weeks or something maybe if people really want to do that not every day

you i'm not thanks for the 250 beaker thank you beaker for the five dollars hey germbo

1226
03:56:37,370 --> 03:56:41,450
do you know what the record is for your longest stream ever have you ever legitimately thought

1227
03:56:41,450 --> 03:56:46,569
of doing a 24-hour stream and then love from the frigid wasteland of northern minnesota

1228
03:56:47,450 --> 03:56:55,239
the longest stream ever was 13 hours and it was uh five days ago it was the lord of the rings

1229
03:56:55,239 --> 03:57:00,260
the two towers it was 13 hours and 20 minutes or something that's an easy question because

1230
03:57:00,260 --> 03:57:06,020
it just happened i've never thought of doing a 24-hour stream because it's very unhealthy

1231
03:57:06,920 --> 03:57:14,340
it's not good unless you are switching off with people for instance if there was three or four

1232
03:57:14,340 --> 03:57:21,459
people that were doing like a charity thing or it's really just not healthy to sit in the same

1233
03:57:21,459 --> 03:57:28,979
spot for 24 hours or more it's just bad for you i don't i could i know i i i was exhausted

1234
03:57:30,620 --> 03:57:38,469
i was physically beaten after that 13-hour stream that adding twice that in a way that's

1235
03:57:38,469 --> 03:57:50,700
just no fun that's no fun would twitch let you sleep on stream if it was pre-approved

1236
03:57:52,250 --> 03:57:55,930
now probably not but maybe but at that point you're like not even streaming at that point

1237
03:57:55,930 --> 03:58:01,719
the clock is just ticking just so you can have a 24-hour stream you know what i mean it's like oh

1238
03:58:01,719 --> 03:58:08,280
yeah though i'm doing a 24-hour stream except i'm doing 13 and i'm going to just lie down

1239
03:58:08,280 --> 03:58:19,579
in bed for eight hours no it's unhealthy i don't want to i don't want to do it the longest you'll

1240
03:58:19,579 --> 03:58:30,940
ever see truly is something like 10 to 13 10 to 14 max you know you nobody you can't you're not

1241
03:58:30,940 --> 03:58:38,379
supposed to just like sit down like that and just stare at us monitor 15 hours it's really just bad

1242
03:58:38,379 --> 03:58:51,399
for you go get a standing desk i don't think i don't want to stand for 15 or 14 hours

1243
03:58:54,680 --> 03:58:59,399
you need to as humans you got to move around you get i mean you if i was going to do a 24-hour

1244
03:58:59,399 --> 03:59:06,620
stream every every like two to three hours i would take like a 30-minute break but then that's you

1245
03:59:06,620 --> 03:59:13,239
know it's just not even at some point you're just doing it just to say you did it which i don't

1246
03:59:13,239 --> 03:59:23,159
really care but no no plans to ever do it dad regal thanks for the 250 i'm sick and tired of

1247
03:59:23,159 --> 03:59:27,639
all the bugleberry hate bugle boys across the nation are rising up and we're not taking it

1248

1250
03:59:42,459 --> 03:59:48,200

like mario odyssey and league of legends anyways keep doing you i'm not sure exactly what you're

1252
03:59:57,239 --> 04:00:03,799
doing in the hospital but hopefully you're good to go that is a wild dream to have considering

1253
04:00:03,799 --> 04:00:11,420
that i will never play league of legends on this channel i did make a league of legends video

1254

1262
04:01:11,100 --> 04:01:26,469

1263
04:01:26,469 --> 04:01:31,510
gonna it was on the list until i stopped doing vr again once i get this bullshit under control

1264
04:01:31,510 --> 04:01:40,040
that's one of the plans to go back to vr too but thank you yanwen you are incredibly talented

1265
04:01:40,600 --> 04:01:49,479
so please hire me as your art tutor i need a job seriously i can't do it i've tried i've had so many

1266
04:01:49,479 --> 04:01:58,309
people try i've had so many people attempt and then i just like i don't have time for it anymore

1267
04:01:58,950 --> 04:02:16,459
but this is a great picture let's put it on don't listen to chat you really can't do it

1268
04:02:18,489 --> 04:02:27,000
granko uh thanks thanks granko is trying to be realistic with me you learned pottery for a joke

1269
04:02:28,520 --> 04:02:33,879
yeah but that's different though you look at how how hard this is to do it takes a ton of time

1270
04:02:34,760 --> 04:02:40,180
i don't have i don't have time i don't have time this is fantastic image though yanwen seriously

1271
04:02:41,610 --> 04:02:52,979
killing it like always we also had 500 bits from siku 500 subs curls

1272
04:02:53,780 --> 04:02:59,620
you can't do curls anymore dummy bear thanks for the 500 bits glad to catch the live stream for

1273
04:02:59,620 --> 04:03:07,959
once glad to have you here thank you oh up upster narwhal thanks for the 300 bits

1274
04:03:08,760 --> 04:03:13,420
hey germa i donated last night about the germa auto emote and got a question for you

1275
04:03:14,059 --> 04:03:18,780
why are emotes not allowed for community content night is there an emote contest coming up soon i

1276
04:03:18,780 --> 04:03:24,860
have more 50 plus emotes on bttv and a hundred total that i've made over the past few months

1277
04:03:25,659 --> 04:03:35,430
you have just described the reason why that is the exact reason why because there's a lot

1278
04:03:36,149 --> 04:03:41,430
and if emotes there would be there would be an entire probably two to three hour section for

1279
04:03:41,430 --> 04:03:53,059
emotes what has happened in the recent months is they're discord emotes i will probably not

1280
04:03:53,059 --> 04:04:00,760
do an official community emote contest again for a while but what we've decided is open up

1281
04:04:00,760 --> 04:04:14,790
emotes for discord but that's kind of the plan for that the discord ones are cool like bits

1282
04:04:15,670 --> 04:04:26,170
yeah there's like a hundred emotes slots yeah but you you gotta remember for me just because it

1283
04:04:26,170 --> 04:04:31,770
exists doesn't mean i want to have them you know what i mean i want new emotes to be

1284
04:04:34,969 --> 04:04:39,129
important and different and i just did you oh well you got a hundred slots just upload a hundred

1285
04:04:39,129 --> 04:04:44,090
emotes i want them to all have their own individual value and not just throw up like

1286
04:04:44,090 --> 04:04:56,520
30 or 40 new emotes just because i have them and i know that germa tv exists but that was a community

1287
04:04:56,520 --> 04:05:03,020
emote you have a hundred slots actually i haven't even looked i don't know i actually i have no idea

1288
04:05:03,020 --> 04:05:05,979
how many slots i have and i don't want to look because i don't want to be i don't want to be

1289
04:05:05,979 --> 04:05:15,989
like embarrassed emotes to me are did was there something so significant that we thought was

1290
04:05:15,989 --> 04:05:24,569
interesting that it needs to be a way to express as a picture you know what i'm saying or just like

1291
04:05:24,569 --> 04:05:35,700
randomly something funny that happens i and it needs to have the test of time too because yes

1292
04:05:35,700 --> 04:05:42,180
i could have 50 different emotes of the same image but like a small change to my face

1293
04:05:43,879 --> 04:05:55,190
but i don't really want to do that discord emote slots oh that would be funny though

1294
04:05:55,750 --> 04:06:00,340
to the planets they're all very important to me there's only like one or two that aren't done

1295
04:06:06,709 --> 04:06:11,510
5g germa and germa psycho are the next ones because they've the test of time is there

1296
04:06:12,629 --> 04:06:18,860
there it is you need to be sure they can stand the test of time we don't want another bald coin

1297
04:06:19,500 --> 04:06:33,139
it's the most requested but no to answer your question community content night

1298
04:06:34,100 --> 04:06:37,780
emotes would just take up so much time and so many people would just submit them and then

1299
04:06:38,819 --> 04:06:41,860
afterwards it's like all right well why don't you why don't you have you have to add those now

1300
04:06:42,500 --> 04:06:46,899
it's like well we just looked at 150 emotes how i'm just gonna i can't

1301
04:06:47,940 --> 04:07:09,610
it's plating the stocks of bld don't use it buy now but we'll see that look all these things

1302
04:07:09,610 --> 04:07:14,969
are subject to change always because i'm gonna bump you here for a second because i don't know

1303
04:07:14,969 --> 04:07:19,770
that this as the channel gets larger and there's more and more people here there's more and more

1304
04:07:19,770 --> 04:07:25,450
things that need to be tweaked and changed and this is not the channel it was two years ago

1305
04:07:26,649 --> 04:07:32,010
it's a lot more people a lot more stuff going on you know i'm saying it the streams might be

1306
04:07:32,010 --> 04:07:37,209
very similar but the channel has changed a little like we've we brought on so many more people

1307
04:07:37,850 --> 04:07:49,430
this motherfucker's gone corporate we have the same emotes from two years ago

1308
04:07:49,430 --> 04:08:02,010
yeah we also have ones from this year like last year too corporate influencer it's all subject

1309
04:08:02,010 --> 04:08:10,979
to change it really is e-clown but thank you magpie for the 500 bits apparently the 3d

1310
04:08:10,979 --> 04:08:16,819
movie maker rat is named the breeze the wiki also has rocco from rocco's modern life for whatever

1311
04:08:16,819 --> 04:08:22,979
fucking reason but that's because there was a nickelodeon 3d movie maker extension add on

1312
04:08:22,979 --> 04:08:32,010
there is a nickelodeon 3d movie maker it exists it's the exact same game but with ren stimpy

1313
04:08:32,090 --> 04:08:45,829
tommy pickles and rocco and shit you need to stream that no bugleberry emote well the i mean

1314
04:08:45,829 --> 04:08:56,840

1324
04:10:09,700 --> 04:10:15,700
what's wrong with that if you have just if you have like a coffee mug that's clean and you

1325
04:10:15,700 --> 04:10:27,219
want to drink a glass of wine put it in the coffee mug who cares is that it doesn't really

1326
04:10:27,219 --> 04:10:38,040
matter it's just a container that holds liquid nobody's seeing me do i'm just you know if i was

1327
04:10:38,040 --> 04:10:45,909
sitting here having a glass of wine out of of coffee mug no but none of you even would know

1328
04:10:45,909 --> 04:10:54,459

1329
04:10:54,459 --> 04:11:05,690
elaborate 40 dollar wine glass no and plus like i have the ninja turtle sippy cups are a godsend

1330
04:11:05,690 --> 04:11:13,420
because i can drop them and be fine you know what happens if you drop a glass of wine on the ground

1331
04:11:14,459 --> 04:11:23,260
it shatters glass goes everywhere and you ruin your floor forever if you drop a sippy cup with

1332
04:11:23,260 --> 04:11:32,790

1335
04:12:00,100 --> 04:12:05,219
watching a thousand hours of jojo's adventure the only reason people like that nonsense

1336
04:12:05,860 --> 04:12:09,379
is because they get stockholm syndrome through watching it for so long

1337
04:12:10,340 --> 04:12:15,219
watch ping pong it's literally the greatest show animated or otherwise to ever grace this earth

that they could lie too no more lies no more lying we're turning over a new leaf no more lying for

1389
04:20:43,290 --> 04:20:47,930
void i just want to tell you not to be discouraged about trying to make art it's a new year's

1390
04:20:47,930 --> 04:20:52,649
resolution i wanted to be a better at drawing because of great communities like this one a lot

1391
04:20:52,649 --> 04:20:57,129
of it is just practice even if you're not satisfied with the quality you can always just keep practicing

1392
04:20:57,129 --> 04:21:05,770
and improving this is very true but also keep in mind that i spend a significant amount of time

1393
04:21:08,469 --> 04:21:15,700
doing this and even when the stream's not on a lot of my free time is based around this stream

1394
04:21:16,500 --> 04:21:19,379
and trying to improve it and try to make new streams and try to

1395
04:21:21,079 --> 04:21:28,040
big projects and try to get contacts with people and this is kind of this is my this is like what

1396
04:21:28,040 --> 04:21:35,190
i do instead of something like art and i think if i really really tried to dump dozens and dozens

1397
04:21:35,190 --> 04:21:40,069
and dozens of hours into something like learning how to draw it would kind of cut into the time

1398
04:21:40,069 --> 04:21:47,879
that i would want to spend working on stuff for the stream and i care very much about it

1399
04:21:50,090 --> 04:22:06,870
this do an art stream uh no no i can't i can't i love art i love art but i i'd rather be a

1400
04:22:06,870 --> 04:22:12,899
observer than a participant that makes any sense it does it makes perfect sense i say that a lot

i just want to fucking laugh and have a good time there's nothing else here that i care about

1429

in a streaming sense right now cry cry influencer i'm talking about no what about kim i'm talking

1430
04:26:54,440 --> 04:27:00,780
about like in a streaming when i turn on my broadcast and what my goals are you know what

1431
04:27:00,780 --> 04:27:10,059
my goals are but i like i live for those moments where something can happen on these streams and

1432
04:27:10,059 --> 04:27:17,350
collectively we all just laugh our fucking asses off i strive for those moments that's i care more

1433
04:27:17,350 --> 04:27:28,729
about that than anything and whether that we think it's funny or if not then that's cool whatever

1434
04:27:28,729 --> 04:27:44,540
but i i do this is circle jerky well that's i'm not trying i'm not trying to make it like a

1435
04:27:44,540 --> 04:28:04,469
i'm such grave circle jerky if you think that then maybe so but you gotta remember

1436
04:28:04,469 --> 04:28:09,670
there's a lot of people that that say stuff like this about this community and i i dress it you

1437
04:28:09,670 --> 04:28:27,879

1439
04:28:35,159 --> 04:28:47,020

1440
04:28:47,020 --> 04:29:10,649
at the guy peeing in the sims true but that's another part of this equation right like i don't

1441
04:29:10,649 --> 04:29:16,409
want i don't want people to feel like that either right like oh dude this is kind of getting a little

fucking like circley like everyone's talking all this positive shit to each other like you're

1443
04:29:20,010 --> 04:29:24,170
getting a little circle jerky it's like i don't want you to i don't want that to be a thing you

1444
04:29:24,170 --> 04:29:30,299
think of either right i don't want that to be like the thing you take from the stream is like oh i

1445
04:29:30,299 --> 04:29:34,780
just chill i just jumped in and like well everyone's i tell you everyone's just pat
