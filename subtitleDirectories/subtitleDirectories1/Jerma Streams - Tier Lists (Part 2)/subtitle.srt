1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:13,000
All right, so with the remaining time that we'll have here, let's do some lists. Anybody have

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:27,899
any special requests? Because this was fun yesterday. Remaining time in quotes. Yeah, well, I mean,

3
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:37,049
I usually only stream for five to seven hours, depending. All right, let me get that on the

4
00:00:37,049 --> 00:01:03,609
screen. We can find one. Snacks. Is there a snack one? Candy. Ooh, that's a good one. I'll do candy.

5
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:16,120
Anybody got a good candy one? Taco Bell menu tier. What? Do these even exist?

6
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:30,310
Do the Soulsborne games? This is easy. Yeah, I can do this one in my sleep. Do I even need to have a

7
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:42,170
tier list open for this? I could just say them. Dark Souls bosses. That's kind of cool. All right,

8
00:01:42,170 --> 00:02:08,680
let's get, I want you to be able to see this shit. And window capture. Please do. And what's that?

9
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:27,219
What? How is that the window? That is not the right window. That is not the right window.

10
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:48,169
Oh, here we go. All right, so I'll do some quick. Do I actually go get a T or am I a faker? Ooh,

11
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:57,419
there is a Dark Souls boss one, is there? Yeah, we'll do this one first. Now, is this supposed

12
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:17,509
to be hard or which one I thought was the coolest? Hold on. I don't want to have any Hulu ads.

13
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,400
Bring this down. Holy fuck, there's so many. I don't even remember that this is too many icons.

14
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:40,039
I don't, I can't do this by icon only. I'm sorry, guys. This is like picking a champion in Dota.

15
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:58,250
I don't know. I don't remember who any of these are. Holy shit. Uh, well, how do I get this on?

16
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,330
I can't even get this on the screen. Do it one at a time. Okay, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do it

17
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:15,270
really slow. One at a time. That's a decent spot for it to be right where you can see S. All right,

18
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:29,819
so let's get this off. Let's get me back on here like this. Hey, what's happening? Okay, um,

19
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:44,259
I have to change. Hold on. Why is this? This is fucked up. Okay, let me, wait, I'm not doing

20
00:04:44,259 --> 00:05:06,060
this for cleanup detail anymore. That's a lie. All right, here we go. Uh, so this is, I don't,

21
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:18,550
who is this? Who is that? You guys gonna have to help me here. Clean my ears? Did, they should

22
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:33,670
be cleaned now? Who is that? I'm not gonna be able to do this. I'm gonna, I'm gonna find my

23
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:58,019
favorite boss. That's all that matters. Bloodborne's not on this list. Never mind. Okay, um, I'm not,

24
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:23,110
I can't do this one. What is this? Germania? Germania. All right, we'll try it. Give this

25
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:36,819
like that. Okay, so what is Germania? Germania tier list maker? Oh, Jesus Christ. It's like picking

26
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:48,949
a chip in a dota again. All right, who, were there really this many people? All right, I can do this.

27
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,720
The pencil doesn't even get a slot apparently. I can do this. I can do this. All right, let's go.

28
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,259
Now, this is not about how strong a character is. Remember, this is like who I think is the coolest

29
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:08,279
character. Not the strongest, just who's the, who's the best character. We'll go, Pac-Man,

30
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:17,689
it has to be somewhere at least at A, S, or A. Uh, the egg. What does Z mean? Let's put egg at F

31
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:27,459
for now. It's the spy, like D. Um, all the bia's have to be down in the same spot. Like they can't,

32
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:35,290
what, is one bia cooler than the other? This is a bia, that's not Mario, that's a bia.

33
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:44,389
Santa, I mean that's just Santa Claus, it's stupid. Elvis is just Elvis. Who is this? Oh, this is

34
00:07:44,389 --> 00:08:04,439
Captain Old Bones. Up here somewhere. Danny DeVito. This is the chicken. The Easter Bunny, F. Like F,

35
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:11,209
like below F, like the pencil. Count Chocula is somewhere in A. Dick Dashley Richard is B.

36
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:20,389
The Magician is definitely somewhere in C. All the serial characters are going to be probably on one

37
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:35,110
list. Yeah, now I have to change this list a little bit. Yeah, because they're all stupid,

38
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,629
and they all go on the same. There's a complete different serial tier, I think,

39
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:44,519
and it's definitely like up here. Yeah, that's good. That's definitely, and then in the serial

40
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:54,139
tier I will determine who I think is the coolest. Baldcoin, probably, probably like F. Baldcoin

41
00:08:54,139 --> 00:09:03,129
sucks. I mean it just glows, that's any one, so it's not fair. This is, it should be a president's

42
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:24,259
tier too. Dr. Roker is at least A. Orson Welles? Earthworm Jim A is the wine guy. Not a serial

43
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:31,539
character, but definitely cooler than like the egg. All like video game characters also have to,

44
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:38,139
besides Pac-Man, because you're up there. And yes, I get to put Pac-Man at S because

45
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,100
in the Smash Brothers games he's like a D, so he gets to go up there on mine.

46
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:58,179
He gets to be S in my one. Okay. What? Pac-Man belongs up there. All video game characters are

47
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:02,100
going to have to be on the same tier too, because this is a shitload of them. And all humans, all

48
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:09,799
real humans, I think should be on the same category too. All right, let's get it, I'm going to put,

49
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:27,419
I'm going to make it, let's call it humans. Because this D. F. Humans. Look, there are too

50
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:47,559
many like just real people. Why is it just a normal picture of his face? All right, who

51
00:10:47,559 --> 00:11:01,029
else is just a regular person? Why is a spy on here twice? Oh, the PSVR absolutely goes up.

52
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:13,370
I love this character. A. Mime belongs down with pencil. What's going on? Why they're like,

53
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:22,779
everything's duplicated. What? Why are there three, four, everything's twice?

54
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:37,659
It's broken. It's all right. I can do it. All right, Burger Boy. Yeah, another big down here.

55
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:50,059
Miserable Mikey. Absolutely belongs up around. Well, hold on. Yeah, that's accurate. Speaking,

56
00:11:50,059 --> 00:12:03,340
this needs to be moved up. Glue Man. Yep. Glue Man goes up to S. I'm going to put like at least

57
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:15,340
two. Is this a? Yeah, I can't tell. I think it is. The green screen belongs up there.

58
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:37,370
Can't be stopped. So this is just a human. What is that? B. B. C. D. B. B. B. C. B. D. B. What is

59
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:55,220
that? B. D. D. B. B. What does that stand for? Yeah, Batman. I don't, I don't even remember

60
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:06,200
making this. So it's down here. Bootleg Duck Dynasty. Yeah, Batman. Holy shit. All right.

61
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:21,980
The egg is already up there, right? No. The movie of the movies characters. Yeah, they belong up

62
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:30,779
here. The pencil is just in the pencil category because it's the pencil. Chicken belongs way up

63
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:37,740
here around B. Disco Diaper is probably B. Hitman is a, is a, no, Hitman. No, it's a character.

64
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,139
It's just Hitman. There's nothing special. It's just, Oh look, he's bald guy with the suit on.

65
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:48,169
No, get rid of it. What was that? It was a giant rat. There's two giant rats though. Which one's

66
00:13:48,169 --> 00:14:11,590
cooler? There are two chickens. Where's the other chicken? There are two chickens. Where? On the

67
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:29,480
list? There are two eggs. There are two chickens and two eggs. Egg one. Chicken one. Okay, there

68
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:44,090
there are two eggs. Where's the other chicken? Who the fuck is that? Oh, that's Ma, that's Kyle.

69
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:57,480
Yeah, that character is pretty cool. Jack's Jerma goes up here. No, no, that's too much. What does

70
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:10,820
this say? Monopoly guy D. Wizard Mike is already up there. The mime's already up there. Dick

71
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,500
Richard's up there. Boo is up there. That's just a person. This is Gabe Newell. Where's Gabe? Gabe

72
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:25,220
Newell is already up there. Yeah, but B. Birdboy's there. I don't think president number seven,

73
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:33,220
whatever his name is. No, down there. This looks good. This is James Madison. I think so.

74
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:49,000
Granny from the Vumps. Well, okay, here, there is just like a Vumps. Let's just,

75
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:59,509
we can collectively use them. Chocula's under cereal. Let's just get all the cereal characters

76
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:14,840
out here. Tony the Tiger's there. Cheese Nips is up here. Oh, no, that's Cheese It's. Definitely

77
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:24,460
somewhere in S. Isn't this, this is the same, this is a different pose of the same person.

78
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:39,940
Frank Pizza? Frank Pizza is not that great. Not a human, though. Does Danny DeVito, all right,

79
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:49,879
the two-person horse. I love that character so much. Human Lord Zaraxos, I mean, just because of his

80
00:16:50,200 --> 00:17:07,000
lower quality. Needs to be somewhere up here. Another president, right? James Giraffe? James

81
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:19,930
Gar, oh, okay. Other presidents. Is Dr. Roker up here? Yep. This is another, another, yeah,

82
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:41,079
but he's already there. I think this is like Star version one. Winston is the, another one guy.

83
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:59,849
Are there only two cereal characters? Oh, there's what? Cheese Nips down there. There's so many

84
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:15,059
people. This is the Archmage. Let's see. Captain Crunch is, is double S tier. Yeah. Demon Grandpa

85
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:26,549
is pretty high for me. It just is. Demon Grandpa is like S for me. Mr. Sneak Man is probably A.

86
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:44,700
There's Paul Bearer, who would definitely be up around B. He's a classic. I don't know what this

87
00:18:44,700 --> 00:19:03,779
is. Can somebody refresh my memory of what this is? No rewinds. Oh, ah, eh. There's the Apple.

88
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:16,890
Definitely down here somewhere. Easy Pete. Easy Pete belongs, uh, at least in A somewhere.

89
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:25,079
There's somebody with a diaper on. I don't know who that is. I swear to God, there's like 10

90
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:45,769
cereal characters. Did I only make like three? No serpents. All right, what about this is the

91
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:55,660
Anor Lander? Somewhere in, somewhere in A. I like this list so far, but I'm going to make a couple

92
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,720
changes. There's the Wirehead guy. I could recognize, I could recognize that vest anywhere.

93
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:12,650
See. Captain Crunch, there you are. You are a cereal character, but you are like,

94
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:22,970
one of the best characters ever. Benjamin Franklin is a pres, is a person, president,

95
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:29,980
but, uh, I mean, this motherfucker invented electricity, so you have to be up here.

96
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:43,190
Carl Griffinstede, uh, probably somewhere like around here. There's a lot of Cs, but there are

97
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:58,819
a lot of C list characters. The EMT. EMT belongs in the human category, but it's going to be like high

98
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:12,410
Z. Disco Diaper's already up there, right? I thought so. Yeah, right here. It's like two

99
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:26,309
different images. Okay, the movies that are up there. I don't know who this is. This Andrew

100
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:35,740
Jackery Jack. Eh, somewhere in D. The Heavy Weapons guy. Oh, okay. Probably should be right next to

101
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,660
the spy. That would make, that makes the most sense. Here is, uh, from Lethal League, Mr. Candyman.

102
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:51,690
I put you in the high Cs here. Anybody else that I didn't put in here? I don't know who this is.

103
00:21:53,539 --> 00:22:07,980
I think that's a mistake. I don't think that person's on here. Sluggo, right? Did I get

104
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:18,730
German Moon? Not yet. Oh, and this is, uh, IRL, uh, 3D CGI Pac-Man. Right. We have

105
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:27,660
cartoon Pac-Man, but we also have like 3D CGI, like made for like the movie version of Pac-Man,

106
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:42,230
which I think is way better. Censored. Yeah, that character sucks. Danny DeVito is not up there.

107
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:57,589
He's just a fucking human. All right. I think that's everybody, at least on this list. I can

108
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:07,180
move some stuff around now. This is, this is most of them. The VR guy. Oh, that's the VR guy. I love

109
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:15,210
that character. Yeah, definitely belongs up here. Up here. Oh, nice. I'm not changing that. He's not,

110
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:24,460
he's not coming down for mess. Did I get this guy? Did he try another guy? I don't think so. No,

111
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:35,910
I did. All right. Who am I missing anybody? The PSVR is up here already. Yeah. There are two Danny

112
00:23:35,910 --> 00:24:00,549
DeVitos. Oh, okay. Yeah. This one, one inhuman. Okay. No 30s milkman. If a 30s milkman belongs

113
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:06,890
down here anyways, doesn't matter. Now I have to make the real one. I can already tell you

114
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:23,500
it's going to look like this. No tooth goblin. So what we have available, two-person horse is

115
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:32,200
probably my moment. I don't know why I have an accent now. Missing German moon. Yeah, you belong

116
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,759
definitely like on B. All right. Two-person horse is my favorite character, I think, out of any of

117
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:54,940
them ever. I've made my final decision on this. The loom man, Pac-Man, Mr. Cheez-It, Steven Grandpa.

118
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:06,420
Yeah, but bring him down. He doesn't belong up there. Neither do I. Hmm. I think that's it for

119
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:23,160
the yeses. Then you got Earthworm Jim, Dr. Elker, PSVR. Hmm. Easy Pete, I think, stays there. Disco

120
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:39,259
diaper comes up. German moon comes up. I go down. Winston goes down very, very much so. All the way

121
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:56,920
down to Lake Sea. They're doing the same pose. I'm all right with this. Maybe, oh, hold on.

122
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:08,740
I would put myself in front of Gabe Newell, but I'm not going to do that. Okay. Miserable Mikey

123
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:18,259
comes forward. Annalander goes down. Mr. Sneak Band takes that place. Jake Richard goes down.

124
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:42,500
Okay, I think, I think that's it. Now it's, no, now it is, now it's good. I think I'm going to bring

125
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:56,019
the, okay. Yeah, I know. People are saying, oh, whoa, hold on. Gabe Newell, I mean, what,

126
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:03,880
Gabe Newell's not like the, besides like the VR headset stuff. Gabe Newell used to be like all over

127
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,480
the place, used to be like everywhere. He used to be on interviews and talking and he was like a

128
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,200
front runner in like the gaming industry. Now he kind of just does his thing, right? Did I get a

129
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:28,200
cut on my hand? Put Gabe in the human spot, but he's almost, he's almost like otherworldly. He's,

130
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:41,640
right? All right, if Danny DeVito is going to be down in the human spot, then, then he should too.

131
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:53,220
He is a human, just a person, but he's a person that's not a president. That's important. I'm

132
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,180
not done. Hold on, I got to move these around. Just, they're all, everyone's freaking out about

133
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,609
this. Just hold on. I'm going to fix it. Just hold on. Don't worry. It's going to be fine.

134
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:05,609
Gabe, Gabe Newell, just because you're on the human list doesn't mean you're like bottom tier.

135
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,490
It just means you're, you're a human and we have to put the humans in the right place.

136
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:26,089
All right. Where was I? B? B looks pretty good. B minus streamer. I'm a B plus streamer now.

137
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:41,720
All right, let's go see. Magician stays there. Orson Welles stays there. Candyman comes up. Wine

138
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,900
Guy replaces, hit the tree. The movies actually goes in front here. The egg goes up in front

139
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:54,630
there. Egg goes actually in front of the movies. Orson Welles stays there. The bumps take over

140
00:28:54,630 --> 00:29:00,119
that spot. Candyman comes down. Wirehead moves over the spot that was occupied by the Wine Guy.

141
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,779
This is kind of just a person. So, you know, not, not that interesting with the characters.

142
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:15,589
Cool. And it's funny, but this context here, Winston goes down here. Benjamin Franklin.

143
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:38,579
Okay. I'm all right with this, I think. Orson Welles is a human, right? It is a human that's

144
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:48,460
not a president. In fact, all humans, all humans that exist in real life or have existed in real

145
00:29:48,460 --> 00:30:01,349
life are going down here. And then we'll have, they'll have their separate list. Benjamin Franklin

146
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:14,230
has to come down here. All people that are real people. Shit. That means Dr. Ocker has to come

147
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:25,640
down. Captain Crunch is not a person. Captain Crunch is a fucking cartoon character. He's not

148
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:43,099
a real guy. He's a serial. Fuck. You're right. You're right. They have to be on the same playing

149
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:51,660
field. No, but there's the other serial. Where's Woody the Woodpecker? Whatever his name is.

150
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,339
The Cuckoo Bird. Hey, I don't see him down here. No, the serial characters don't need their own

151
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:05,819
list because this is where they belong. I'm removing the serial character list.

152
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:28,490
Okay. That's good. Remove the human? Oh, there are too many. I can't, I can't put, I can't put like

153
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:38,329
fucking James Madison up here. Like, no, they don't, they exist on their own plane. Two-person

154
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:44,970
horse is a human. That is a horse. That is a, no, it's not. That is two horse pieces.

155
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:55,960
Jerm is a human. All right. All right. I'm getting rid of that. I'll get rid of it.

156
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:07,049
I'm just, I am just categorizing people. Like, oh, you're a human. You're a serial character.

157
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,759
You're a cartoon character. That's not a tier list. That's just what are they? All right. I'm

158
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:19,450
getting rid of the humans. You go back here. You, I still don't think I would put you any higher than

159
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:31,670
that. But they, all the humans would be like C anyways. I'm gonna have to get them all in C

160
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:46,500
and then move them around. No, I mean, like, James Madison sucks. Like, the characters are stupid.

161
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,890
Both of these two presidents characters are filler content. It is the equivalent of a

162
00:32:52,890 --> 00:33:09,029
filler episode of a TV show. Van Buren rocks. That's right. You can love the filler episode.

163
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,309
I love some filler episodes. It doesn't mean that they're not filler episodes.

164
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:22,940
They, they're filler episodes. That like sucks too. It was just like,

165
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:47,460
all the presidents are like down at the bottom here. Make the humans row F. No, that isn't,

166
00:33:47,460 --> 00:34:00,539
no. Z is F. I'm changing Z to F. This is F. What are you doing? Excuse me. F. That is just F.

167
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:10,360
I'm just gonna remove the human tier. Star. I'm just, I'm, this is not final yet. Hold on,

168
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:17,929
everybody. No rewinds. Belongs in D. And then Orson Welles belongs probably up here. Okay,

169
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:32,840
let's get her to the human tier. Now we can work with this. Okay. Do you guys understand why I had

170
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,739
a human tier in the first place? Because now you're making me rate my friends. That, you

171
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:47,900
understand? Having everybody in the human tier. Oh, well, aren't they like MLC stealth? There's

172
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,940
definitely like cooler than boo. No, but boo is better than a talent. This is why I wanted to

173
00:34:52,940 --> 00:35:27,030
avoid that. Star belongs up. You're making me rate my friends. I'm doing a friend tier. No, yeah,

174
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,050
that's Gabe Newell. Never mind. All right, the friends of friends. The friend, that's the friend

175
00:35:31,050 --> 00:36:11,659
tier. What? Oh, fuck. What's going on? Hey, what's going on? Is that it? Okay. All right.

176
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:35,880
Now I'm going to rename this to D. What are you doing? What are you doing? D. Okay. All right,

177
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:52,679
so now I'm ready. We did B. I'm happy with that. C. C is, I think, pretty good. Friends. Doesn't

178
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,039
matter where any of them are. Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. They're all friends. And they're

179
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:01,320
all cool. And I like, they're all fun. And I like them. Okay, cool. None of this list does not mean

180
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:08,440
however high anybody is, that they're cooler or liked more. This is just a non description list

181
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:16,440
of people that not from any particular order are just on the list. Okay, there you go. And I'm

182
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:24,150
going to put the friends down here because they are not, they are not part of this. They're,

183
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:31,619
they're down here. They, they're down there because this is like, this is the pencil tier

184
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:38,340
and this is friends. So they're just in a separate category. The pencil tier is not

185
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:46,179
part of A, B, C, D, S, D, E, F. Okay. It's just the pencil tier. The friend here is,

186
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:53,829
is not part of the, of this, of this stuff here. Okay. Now that we've got that situated,

187
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:18,730
A, B, A, B, C, D. Okay. D is going to be hard. I'm going to have to change some of this around.

188
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:34,260
Okay. This is going to be hard. They, they're all so bad. All the BS have to be at the bottom.

189
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:41,659
This is too many of them. Santa should, should be like over here. Maybe DeVito should be here.

190
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:45,579
Apple is like a little bit closer up just because Cheese Nips is like just a shit character, but

191
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:55,750
it's fun. That's another BI down here. Okay. I'm not, I don't hate this so far. All right.

192
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:22,059
Does anybody need to come down or up from F? Maybe the F. Okay. These are the, that's it.

193
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:32,059
It's done. I'm happy with it. This is D plus. I would put Frank Pizza in a D plus.

194
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,610
Vault coins probably at the bottom here. Not that I don't like vault coin, but

195
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:51,219
maybe up here. The apple should be up here. James, no, James Garfield is a president down here.

196
00:39:54,519 --> 00:40:03,750
Andrew Jackereject is also a, also president, right? But the coolest one out of, out of all

197
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:09,909
the characters, because it's just, this is, it's like, I made him in Fallout. So it works. It

198
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:24,389
still works. Joop, Joop, Joop, Joop, Joop, Joop. What's going on? Where's Batboy? Down with pencil.

199
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:36,420
I do need to find out what the worst character that I ever is though. That's important. Okay.

200
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:55,900
Let's see. The Monopoly guy's got to come up way up here. I think that's all right. All right.

201
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:20,420
We did that. Looks pretty clean. The worst character ever. It's the mime. It is. There's no

202
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:28,500
context to this channel. There's no joke. At least these, like the sensor bar, Garfield,

203
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,300
Hitman. I played Hitman and it was fun. This is like a monster of a bunch of different other

204
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:39,860
characters that I had. Sluggo is, he's been around. The pencil sucks, but the Easter bunny. Oh,

205
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,739
it's going to be close. Okay. But the mime is not, what's the mime? This is a mime.

206
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,880
There's no joke there. It's just a mime. Every single character on this list came from

207
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,480
something or was made for a reason. This is another filler episode, but this is the kind

208
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,519
of filler episode that you tell your friends to skip. You say, don't watch that one. You can

209
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:19,579
just skip that one. Some filler episodes are great. That one, not so much. The pencil is,

210
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:25,130
I don't think the pencil belongs down here. I'm changing this category.

211
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:32,730
Let's look at that. Look at that. Look at how, look at that. Look through the eraser and the

212
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,679
length and the top. This is, that's a, it's a fun, that's fun. It doesn't belong down here.

213
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:55,300
It doesn't deserve its own category. I don't think so. Better than, it's better than a PM

214
00:42:56,019 --> 00:43:13,239
and Danny DeVito and Sam and all the presidents. Okay. But who is the least worst character?

215
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:24,179
Just because I don't know who this is. I don't know. I'm going to put it down here.

216
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:50,760
No, but Hitman is just Hitman. I'm done. That's it. From the available characters. That's it.

217
00:43:50,760 --> 00:44:04,840
Where does, take a screenshot. The pencil isn't in pencil tier. Yeah, I know.

218
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:27,239
It's missing key characters, but we, but I still did it. There. Just terrible.

219
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:35,059
Demon Lord's Araxas should not be grouped up with the mortals.

220
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:54,090
That's fine. Where's the snack one? Where's the next one? Snacks? Cereals? Oh, fuck yeah.

221
00:44:54,090 --> 00:45:12,420
Cereals. Let's do cereals. Oh, fuck yeah. Does this have them all? I don't, I don't think it has

222
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:25,559
them all. Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me sniff this list for a second. No. Is there a

223
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:42,920
better one? Is there one with more? Is there one with more? This one best cereals? Is this one

224
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:59,699
better? All right. That's, that's more. That's better. Okay. I think I'm ready. All cereals.

225
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:10,489
There's, there's another one. I can't right click it. I can't click it. I can't click it. I got it.

226
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:51,159
All right. Hold on. Everybody relax. Hold on. This is all serious. Oh my God. S S S A B C D

227
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:59,900
Probably trash. What is that? Why? Why? How would that not be? Never had it. You're just guessing.

228
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:08,739
You're just saying that it's trash. I never had this before. Well, I also think that's trash.

229
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:17,380
That's not how it works. I'm deleting this one. Like, no, that's, that's, I've never had it

230
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:28,550
or it's trash. Here we go. Oh, this is a shredded wheat. Never had this. Shredded wheat. No, I never

231
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:34,949
had it. Frosted chocolate strawberry. I never had it. When it's going to go when, as they come in.

232
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:42,199
Frosted chocolate strawberry. Frosted shredded wheat chocolate. Shredded wheat. Shredded wheat.

233
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:53,500
Shredded wheat. Cheerios on crunch. Oat crunch. I've never had it. Cookie crisp. Now is this 1996

234
00:47:53,500 --> 00:48:07,500
cookie crisp or is this 2019 cookie crisp? That's a big difference. 1995 cookie crisp is up here.

235
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:15,219
2019 cookie crisp is down here. I'm going to assume by the box art that this is like later,

236
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:27,829
like 2010 plus. Belongs down here. Maple bacon donuts. Who the fuck buys that cereal?

237
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:35,960
I don't think anyone's ever purchased that. Why would you buy that? Maple bacon donut cereal.

238
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:44,039
That's like between Captain Crunch, Cheerios. So you got Cheerios, Captain Crunch, Lucky Charms,

239
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:55,320
like Raisin Bran. Maple bacon donut. That's, you never, why would you pick this one? I've never,

240
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:02,699
no it's probably trash. Chicken and waffles. What are these? This is the same bullshit.

241
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:09,179
People might think this is unpopular opinion here. This is the same bullshit of potato chip

242
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:15,260
flavorings. Are we going down that road with cereals now? Oh this is ketchup mustard pickles

243
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:23,369
and dipped in acid and fiery red tomato. No, like I don't want that. Just give me fucking sour

244
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:34,730
cream and onion. Well this is mesquite barbecue chili lime bacon. All right. This is BLT flavored

245
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:43,980
potato. This is BLT flavored potato chips. That makes no sense. So it's a it's a mayonnaise and

246
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:55,000
lettuce flavored potato chip. Oh yeah you get the chicken and waffles cereal. We're going too far.

247
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:13,929
This cereal is called Good Friends. Cocoa Puffs. I'm gonna start at a B. Put it on the friend tier.

248
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:24,119
Wheaties. I don't buy, I don't buy Wheaties. I don't read Wheaties. Reese's Buffs.

249
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:31,719
See you later. Trix. See you later. Alphabet's never had it. These are apple cinnamon Cheerios.

250
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:36,820
They're okay. Apple cinnamon toast crunch. It's a fucking dumb potato chip flavoring.

251
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:57,539
Banana nut Cheerios. That sounds pretty good. Boo Berry. Up at B. Chips Ahoy. I've had it a

252
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:10,070
couple times but it was all right. Cinnamon toast crunch is god tier. Yes. Apple cinnamon toast

253
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:28,900
crunch is not god tier. Have you had it? I've had it. I've had it. Why is apple cinnamon Cheerios

254
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:35,300
C tier? Because that's Cheerios with apple cinnamon. This is this is fucking french

255
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,460
toast with cinnamon and apples on it. Which is actually fucking really really good.

256
00:51:46,099 --> 00:52:01,769
Uh Kix. I used to love Kix actually. Kix and Pops. Is Pops on here? Blueberry Cheerios.

257
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:09,750
Now get this get this green ketchup. I don't want it. Shredded wheat. I don't I haven't I don't eat

258
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:16,969
these. Cocoa Pebbles. The thing about Cocoa, I'm gonna do both these right now. Cocoa Pebbles and

259
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:23,210
Fruity Pebbles. Um are we talking about the first 30 seconds? Or are we talking about the rest of

260
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:30,869
the time you eat the cereal? Because once you once you pour the milk in and you eat the cereal

261
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:36,500
it's like it's S. S. S. But after about 25 seconds it becomes something you want to just throw in the

262
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:46,840
trash. They just become hard boogers that you're eating. It's just individual boogers. That's what

263
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:55,780
they turn into. The shit that you pull out of your nose is what each every single pebble turns into

264
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:14,170
in about two minutes. I'm sorry but that's just I'm telling you how I feel. That's a big deal with

265
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:37,139
cereal. It is. Eat them dry. No eat them dry is like eating glass. No those can move. I'm just I

266
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:42,940
need to I have to see it first. Is this another one of those things where it's just it's doing

267
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:56,409
them all again twice? Why is it why am I happening to me? Golden Oreo. I've had Oreo always before

268
00:53:56,409 --> 00:54:05,530
but not these ones. What's the difference? Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles. I'm gonna bump this up

269
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:13,619
just because. No I've never had it never mind. That sounds pretty good. Nilla. Never had it.

270
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:24,230
Nutter Butter Cereal. This is another thing with cereals is they just have they just put

271
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:36,219
cookies in a bowl. Cookie Crisp. Yeah I understand but I that's not that's not like good.

272
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:45,369
Putting putting like cookies in a bowl with milk on them. That's not a breakfast. Maybe that's why

273
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:56,409
they changed the recipe. Oreo Ore is they're very good though. They are insanely good. Peanut

274
00:54:56,409 --> 00:55:03,079
Butter Fruity Pebbles. They're all gonna be on the same. They're not I can't get over it.

275
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:11,500
This is is this real? There's only one place you should ever put a Sour Patch Kid in your

276
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:20,280
fucking mouth and that's at a movie theater. A cereal for this shit. You better eat that at

277
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:35,880
the movie theater or there's no reason to buy that. Oh yeah that goes up here. They mass produced

278
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:43,639
they had to produce that. They had to been enough interest in that for them to make like 500,000

279
00:55:44,199 --> 00:56:01,219
boxes of this. I don't need to taste it. Bran Flakes. I don't think we've ever had this brand

280
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:09,099
before. Honeycomb. I think I've had it a few times. It was all right. Cheerios Ancient Grains.

281
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:23,210
That's why that says ancient grains. Is that supposed to mean it's healthier because it's

282
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:31,619
using old spices or something? Or does it mean ancient grains like we've been storing them for

283
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:47,320
a long time? I haven't had it. Cheerios Protein. Never had them. Chex. I'm gonna have to I'm gonna

284
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:58,460
oh I don't buy Chex. I don't eat Chex. No. Belongs on the floor in your bathroom not in a cereal.

285
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:06,460
This tile motherfucking cereal. Get out of here. All right here we go. Chocolate Cheerios.

286
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:20,019
Um that doesn't sound very good but I haven't had them. Now this is Chocolate Lucky Charms.

287
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:31,210
I have had these I think once. They weren't as good as the regular ones. I like the regular

288
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:37,980
ones better but they weren't bad. We'll keep them here for now. Chocolate Toast Crunch.

289
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:52,949
That just doesn't make it. Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Chocolate Toast Crunch. What is Chocolate Toast?

290
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:05,079
Chocolate Toast to me is I guess when you when you Nutella on your toast or something.

291
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:15,219
Is that what it's supposed to taste like? Not for me. Cheerios Cereal. I haven't had it. Here we go.

292
00:58:15,219 --> 00:58:28,099
Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It belongs up here. Nothing's est here yet. Not yet but it could be very soon.

293
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:38,309
Count Chocula is up here somewhere in C I think. Cotton Candy Crunch. That sounds disgusting but

294
00:58:38,309 --> 00:58:45,510
I'm gonna buy it at the grocery store tomorrow. That sounds truly awful but I'm gonna get it.

295
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:53,159
Crunch Berries belongs up here and what what's with this? Wait oh this is the different trick.

296
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:59,929
Okay one of these tricks is I'm I know this. Okay so these the two tricks is one of them was

297
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:06,010
we want a healthier cereal and we want less dye in our cereals and we want it to be healthier and

298
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:12,019
no more colorings and make it like less sugar and then they did that as this one and and then

299
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:15,780
everybody had it and said no I don't want that give me the fucking colors back give me like the

300
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:21,719
sugar back and so they they ditched that and started doing the old one again. That's what

301
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:33,980
happened right? There was such an outcry about how gross and not colorful and not yummy and delicious

302
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:39,369
and sugary that this one was. The healthy one that everybody wanted. Give us a healthier alternative

303
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:46,579
to tricks. I want no food dye. Okay well here's one without food dye. Oh that looks like bird poo.

304
00:59:46,579 --> 01:00:08,250
Give me the other one. I have never had it though. Fucking consumerists. Frank and Berry is it's

305
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:17,429
all right. I have two tricks is on the list. Yeah I know that that's the different the different

306
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:21,989
versions. This is this is the the new the one that the healthy one right. Go look it up that happened.

307
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:40,119
French Toast Crunch is better than Cinnamon Toast Crunch. In fact it might be the first S.

308
01:00:46,219 --> 01:01:08,469
I think so. It's okay to be wrong. French Toast Crunch is insane. It's it's insane. It's really

309
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:17,980
good. That's really good. Cinnamon Toast Crunch is fucking good too. Cinnamon Toast Crunch is really

310
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:23,030
really good. I just think that French Toast Crunch is a little bit better. Just a little.

311
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:38,539
Cocoa Wheats. Never had it. Total. I've actually never eaten total. Frosted Cheerios.

312
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:51,610
Oh they're gross. I've had them a few times. It's not they're not good. They're not good.

313
01:01:52,250 --> 01:02:00,920
Just eat Frosted Flakes. It's Frosted Flakes are better. They feel better in your mouth. They crunch

314
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:09,480
better. I don't like them. If you like them I'm glad you do. Maybe it's D-. I don't it doesn't

315
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:23,980
belong on like the movie candy box. Yeah but I'm not a big fan. Fruity Cheerios. Chocolate Peanut

316
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:31,530
Butter Cheerios. Haven't had them. Now here's a the issue here. This is Golden Crisp but where's

317
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:35,530
Smacks? Because they're the same cereal. One of them is just way better. And do you know which one

318
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:50,760
it is? Which one is way better? I'm glad we have some intelligent people in this chat. Smacks are

319
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:56,519
way better. So these are coming up at probably around like D plus C minus. Smacks are going to

320
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:03,210
be up at like B. Golden Grahams suffer from the same problem that Fruity Pebbles suffer from and

321
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:10,539
they get soggy in about 10 seconds. I have eaten Golden Grahams before and they taste great but

322
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:16,260
Golden Grahams are the worst offender for that. You will pour your milk on these fucking things.

323
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:24,260
Turn around to go get a spoon. Turn back around and it's porridge. It just did. I can't. I don't.

324
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:33,539
It's got to be crunchy. I don't eat cereal dry. I don't do that. But you have to do with Golden

325
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:39,239
Grahams and with some of these others. This is a tactic. I mean I did this a lot when I was in

326
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:46,920
college. Is you get a mug of milk and what you do is you have like a drinking mug. Take whatever

327
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:54,099
cereal you want. Sprinkle a little bit on the top. Like make a little top layer of cereal on top of

328
01:03:54,099 --> 01:04:01,639
the milk in your cup and just like sip it and crunch it and stuff. Therefore you can keep putting

329
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:08,920
a top layer. Sip, crunch, top layer, sip, crunch. It works out really well. It's the only way I can

330
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:15,300
really eat those. Otherwise that's too much work. But then I get soggy cereal. I don't want to eat

331
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,460
that. Every time I get to the end of the... When you get like halfway down and it's just...

332
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:27,059
When your cereal goes like this, that's not good. You don't want to eat that. It's

333
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:35,820
it's not appetizing. Just eat it faster. No, you don't eat... What do you mean eat it faster?

334
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:42,900
No, you don't just wolf down food as fast as you can. I got to do this before I get soggy.

335
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:56,949
No, you want to eat and enjoy your meal. I don't eat cereal dry. I eat it wet with milk.

336
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:03,739
I usually put almond milk on it and that's not because I... That's a stomach and intestinal issue

337
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:08,780
that's not like a, oh I prefer whole milk. I just... I drink almond milk but I put almond milk on

338
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:23,690
because it's a stomach problem. Okay, okay. Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes. What? That's real?

339
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:37,989
Frosted Flakes Lucky Charms? I need to get these too. It's gonna... No way. I didn't make a new list.

340
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:47,980
I gotta add Roblo. This is called... This is gonna be the get next time at the grocery store list.

341
01:05:55,610 --> 01:06:03,380
Yeah, like just order this. Wait, there's another one too, right? Okay. Any others on here that I

342
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:10,650
like... Do I want to eat? This is the next time I go to the grocery store. I'm gonna get these.

343
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:23,989
No, I'm not eating Sour Patch Kids. All right, Grape Nuts. I've not really had them. All right.

344
01:06:23,989 --> 01:06:27,190
Honey Bunches of Oats. The only one I've had is with strawberries and it's very good.

345
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:36,860
I would put it somewhere in like high C, maybe low B. The rest of them I have not had.

346
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:44,329
Honey Bunches are good. Yeah, the Honey Bunches of Oats with strawberries. That's the one I've

347
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:54,070
ordered. The rest of these, yeah, I've never had them before. There's so many cereals.

348
01:06:54,710 --> 01:07:02,139
Honey Bunches of Oats S'mores and Almonds. Get that. Kicks is already up here, isn't it?

349
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:12,010
Isn't Kicks already up here? It's just... What's the difference?

350
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:24,730
Honey Kicks versus what's this Kicks? Chocolate? Oh, no. I just had regular Kicks.

351
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:35,909
I've never had chocolate Kicks before. I don't know. All right, here we go. Time for a staple.

352
01:07:35,909 --> 01:07:44,940
Here come the staples. Honey Nut Cheerios belongs up here. I would say Honey Nut Cheerios is...

353
01:07:45,659 --> 01:08:25,220
There's so many options now that it's like hard to put that higher. All right. Where was I?

354
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:37,350
Honey Nut Cheerios Medley Crunch. I don't know if that is five or one. No. Honey Bunches of Oats.

355
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:41,270
This one, I haven't had it. Raisin Bran Crunch. Get that one. I've always wanted to eat it and

356
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:53,609
never have it. Frosted Flakes. They go up here. Just regular Frosted Flakes. No bullshit. Tony

357
01:08:53,609 --> 01:09:03,319
the Tiger. They taste good. They're really, really, really yummy. They've been around for like 150

358
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:10,039
years. Like blacksmiths used to fucking eat this when they were making swords. So it belongs up

359
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:24,470
here. Crave. I don't think it's as high as A, but it's all right. Crave is like a little...

360
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:34,100
Crave is like a little disgusting though. It gets gross. Like anything that is filled with something

361
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:43,640
else. Something crunchy filled with this. It's usually... It's very hit or miss. I'm going to

362
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:50,630
put it below 2019 Cookie Crisp, I think. It's still good though. Still... And what is this doing all

363
01:09:50,630 --> 01:10:03,270
the way down here? I'm going to put this one down because it's kind of taken up too much space.

364
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:14,460
You know that I haven't had these. Fruit Loops with Marshmallows. Man, they really are adding

365
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:21,800
marshmallows to everything, huh? Never had it. I don't really want it though. Frosted Crispies.

366
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:31,239
That's not the only SS tier that... Where is it? Is it on here? Where is Rice Crispy Treats

367
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:46,300
cereal? That's the highest on the whole list. It's mostly all cereals. There's no Rice Crispy

368
01:10:46,300 --> 01:11:09,930
Treats cereal. Can I just pretend? Blind. Am I blind? Where is it? Rice Crispy Treats. It's

369
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:26,250
purple. Oh, fuck yeah. Rice Crispy Treats cereal is unstoppable. It is insane. What do you mean he

370
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:39,859
doesn't know? What do I not know? What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? Rice Crispy Treats cereal

371
01:11:39,859 --> 01:11:57,779
is so bad. No, it's not. So this is Frosted Crispies. Never had it. Apple Jacks is very...

372
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:10,090
It's very boring to me. It's boring. It's very boring. It doesn't do it for me. Now I've had

373
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:13,529
Frosted Mini Wheats. I've had the regular ones, just the default ones, which are these, right?

374
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:20,329
And they're pretty good. These I would eat dry. It's one of the only cereals I would eat dry

375
01:12:20,329 --> 01:12:33,930
because you kind of have to. They're very good. It's good with milk. Yeah, I know it is, but I

376
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:50,100
would eat these dry. Why am I watching this? I don't even eat cereal. Cocoa Crispies last longer

377
01:12:50,739 --> 01:13:07,659
than Cocoa Pebbles, so they're better. Measelicks. I don't know what it is. Frosted Mini

378
01:13:07,659 --> 01:13:10,699
Wheats. I don't have, never had them. They're like little bites. Never had them.

379
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:18,760
Different flavors of little mini bites. All brand have never had any of these. Pops. Here we go.

380
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:51,989
The second of our S tier is Pops. Wait a minute. A Cracklin' Oat Bran. No, that's an old people's

381
01:13:51,989 --> 01:13:59,819
cereal. Chocolate Frosted Flakes. I've never... Get them. Rice Crispies. They're too... That's

382
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:05,909
too default for me. I wouldn't... I would never... It's not trash, but I would never order them

383
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:13,479
because they're not... They're just too boring. Crispicks. Never had it. Some other weird version

384
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:19,319
of Crave that I've never had. Smart Start. Never had it. Raisin Bran. Belongs.

385
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:26,069
Somewhere up here, and I would say B. Not quite as good as a Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but it's still

386
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:38,970
good. Kicks. That's regular kicks, right? Yeah. This is just regular kicks, but these are great.

387
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:50,380
They're definitely at least A or B. I'm gonna put them in B for now. Any of these Maple Cheerios?

388
01:14:51,020 --> 01:15:04,359
Mm-mm. Fruit Brute. Wait a minute. Hold on. There's an Oops All Berries. Get this. Is it... Is it

389
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:12,979
All Crunch Berries one? Oops All Berries. All right. I'm gonna put this in line of like where...

390
01:15:12,979 --> 01:15:27,029
What I want the most. Captain Crunch is the best cereal. It is. It is the best cereal you can

391
01:15:27,029 --> 01:15:35,529
possibly eat. There are... There are no other cereals that are worth eating more than just

392
01:15:35,529 --> 01:15:47,939
regular Captain Crunch. None. Some of them come close, as you see. Not close enough. I just

393
01:15:48,579 --> 01:15:56,279
teleport myself back to when I was like 12, and every one of those individual deep like earthy

394
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:02,619
corn tastes like starchy sweet flavorings. I know. I can feel it right now. I know what it

395
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:07,829
tastes like right now. I can taste it right now. Can you taste things in your head? I can taste

396
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:27,180
that right now. Perfect. I can... I feel it. Is it another one of those? Okay. Regular Cheerios.

397
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:37,369
I just don't... I want to... I don't want to... They're not bad. Look. I would put them high on D.

398
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:45,560
But they're... No. I don't... Look. You can get like... When there's... Okay. When there are

399
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:51,960
Honey Nut Maple Chocolate Frosted Oreos, why would you get the regular Cheerios? I don't know.

400
01:16:51,960 --> 01:17:04,600
I mean, I guess they're... It's just... It's just cereal. Interesting. Because I'll like the...

401
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,659
I don't think I would even... If some... You know how people say,

402
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:15,939
oh, I wouldn't order it. But if you gave it to me and you're like, hey, you want a bowl of Cheerios?

403
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:21,189
I'd say, yeah. I don't think I would say yes. That's one of those scenarios. Like,

404
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:30,090
you got anything else in a very not disrespectful way. Oh, you want some Cheerios? Cheerios?

405
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:41,020
Like Mustard Box Cheerios? Or what are you talking about? Oh, yeah. Just Cheerios. I'm not a baby.

406
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:53,720
That's baby food. That's what babies eat. I'm a man. It's baby food. It's very good baby food.

407
01:17:53,720 --> 01:18:01,930
It's really good for you. But I'm old. I'm too old for Cheerios. Or like the guy with the salt

408
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:09,029
and pepper hair that's sitting there eating the bowl, talking to what I assume is his like

409
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:14,470
five-year-old daughter. What are you doing, Dad? I'm just working on my cholesterol, honey.

410
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:19,029
And then the commercial ends. Doesn't matter. That's the whole commercial.

411
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:37,479
Those are the two scenarios. Which, by the way, I could tell you. I know that like, oh, eating

412
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:42,600
Cheerios every day will lower your cholesterol. But no, no, no. That's not what it is. It's eating

413
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:49,189
Cheerios every day and having a good healthy lifestyle could lower your cholesterol. Right.

414
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:59,260
Okay. Yeah. Hey, don't eat a Big Mac. You won't clog your arteries. Okay. If you stop smoking

415
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:10,680
cigarettes, you might be able to run faster in a couple of years. All right. That's good to know.

416
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:23,689
So be healthy. All right. What's the point? The point is that it's just like, eat lettuce

417
01:19:24,649 --> 01:19:29,770
and be healthier and you'll be healthier. It's not the lettuce that's doing it. It's the fact

418
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:39,380
that you live in a healthier lifestyle. Just be healthy. Yeah. Cheerios. Just be healthy, forehead.

419
01:19:40,439 --> 01:20:03,939
Replace the fucking heart here with like the forehead. Drink dried sugar. What is this one?

420
01:20:03,939 --> 01:20:11,060
I don't know. What's this one? Lucky Charms Magical Unicorn. Is Lucky Charms on here already?

421
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:24,970
It's not. Is there like just a regular Lucky Charms? I don't see the regular Lucky Charms anywhere.

422
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:36,680
Well, I'm just gonna say this is regular Lucky Charms. What is the cereal string?

423
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:50,890
Never. Lucky Charms, you just avoid all the fucking cheerio bits and you eat the marshmallows.

424
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:59,300
Everybody does that. And you end up with like 30 to 40 pieces of soggy, just beige cardboard that's

425
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,659
in the bottom. And you just like, you don't feel bad. You're like, eh, I kind of feel bad I didn't

426
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:20,149
eat that. It's all right. Peanut Butter Crunch is also up here pretty high. I would say somewhere,

427
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,859
I think it's better than Crunch Bears. But is it better than Frosted Flakes?

428
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:46,810
They both are. Frosted Flakes belongs down here. Okay. Just making sure. All right.

429
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:56,680
Fruit Loops. Regular Fruit Loops. I'm like, have I blinked? My eyes are getting so dry and watery

430
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:06,229
and hard. That was a complete oxymoron. My eyes are getting really dry. Fruit Loops.

431
01:22:21,579 --> 01:22:25,020
Better than blueberry, but they're not. They're okay. They're all right.

432
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:31,239
Multi-Grain Cheerios. Somebody said if I didn't put this at at least A, they were going to

433
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:40,840
unsubscribe. I'm sorry. I don't, I've had them a bunch of times. They're just, they're just

434
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,479
regular Oreos. No, why do I keep saying Oreos? They're just regular Cheerios,

435
01:22:46,760 --> 01:23:01,159
but some of them taste like pumpernickel bread. It's not a bad thing, but I don't

436
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:09,720
put fresh honey on them. But I'm like, I hope you're not, I hope you're still here.

437
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:17,109
Look, I put, I didn't put them down below in the trash category. I put them like right here.

438
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:23,909
They're definitely better than blueberry. In fact, blueberry should be at the bottom of D.

439
01:23:23,909 --> 01:23:32,659
Like I, I don't even know. That's only up there because he's friends with Count Chocula.

440
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:37,859
You know what I mean? He's like, he's like sapping some of the clout from Count Chocula.

441
01:23:37,859 --> 01:23:42,659
That's the only reason why he's there. I'm going to, he's coming down. This is like part of Count

442
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:49,289
Chocula's entourage. Where's the other one? Yeah. The Count Chocula entourage is not as good as

443
01:23:49,289 --> 01:24:01,340
Count Chocula. It's cereal nepotism. Yes, that is exactly right. So we're going to put Count

444
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:12,920
Chocula where you belong. These are both the same cereal. They just tell you, it just, they just say

445
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:28,550
it's a different flavor on the box. All they have to pay for is like the art and the boxwork. Yeah,

446
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:36,579
no. I mean, Frankenberry is kind of good. I would say of like the Count Chocula fucking like princes,

447
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,529
Frankenberry is next in line for throne, I think. Once Count Chocula gets like fucking killed,

448
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:56,539
it's like next in line. Here comes Frankenberry. Cereal nobility. Yeah. Once like the throne gets

449
01:24:56,539 --> 01:25:08,859
overthrown, like the English come in, then yeah, Frankenberry. I don't, I've never had any of these.

450
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:23,720
Apple Jacks is the same thing as Apple Jacks. They're the same cereal. So this comes back down

451
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:33,510
to here to right. It's the same cereal. There are so many like cinnamon toast, cinnamon apple

452
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:41,100
jack. There's so many of those. Everybody has their own version of cinnamon crusty apple crusts

453
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:47,829
that it's hard. They blend together and they all have a green box. They have a green and red box.

454
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:55,609
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Green and red box, cinnamon, apple, apple cinnamon flavoring.

455
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:03,000
Hold on a minute here. Wait, wait, wait. Apple cinnamon toast crunch is green box,

456
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,039
green and red. Apple Cheerios, apple cinnamon is green box.

457
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:16,949
Come on. They're all, they're all green boxes with red letters and they're all

458
01:26:16,949 --> 01:26:25,609
apple fucking cinnamon flavoring. Sour Patch. Apple, it's too much apple. It's too sour.

459
01:26:25,609 --> 01:26:44,329
Don't you get it? Apples are sour. It's a green apple, green box. That was great. J. Jonah Jameson.

460
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:08,890
Yummy Mummy. I don't, I don't want it. All right. I definitely, I've never had it before,

461
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:13,210
but I don't think I want like, I'm not tall enough to see over the table frosted flakes.

462
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:27,380
It's supposed to be big and strong. That's, what's that saying? What's this? Rice,

463
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:37,020
Rice Krispies. What is that? That better be an apple fucking flavoring. Is it apple cinnamon?

464
01:27:37,579 --> 01:27:53,539
Tell me it is. Tell me that's apple fucking cinnamon. I've had frosted flakes with marshmallows.

465
01:27:54,260 --> 01:28:20,420
They're very bad. Too sugary. Way too sugary. Frosted flakes are so sugary to begin with.

466
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:26,579
And then the flavor from the marshmallow, it's too much. It is. I was so excited for these.

467
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:34,279
I remember being like, holy shit, that's so awesome. And it's just too much. It's too fucking much.

468
01:28:39,159 --> 01:28:44,039
It's worse than movie theater food. No, it's not. I have, I'm, look, I'm just placing them

469
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:51,000
right now and then I'm going to go through and we're going to figure it out. Yeah. These,

470
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:57,590
they're not, they're not that good. They really aren't. Not, not to me. I've never had these.

471
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:04,409
Kellogg's corn flakes. Well, Kellogg's corn flakes, I don't think are trash,

472
01:29:05,369 --> 01:29:12,359
but they're just unfinished frosted flakes. They're default character creator cereal. So

473
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:23,859
I'm going to, they have to be below frosted flakes. They're not bad though. Corn flakes are good. Like

474
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:35,100
just corn is good. When it's mashed up and like mob, like rocked up, it's when it's smushed up

475
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:39,100
and then hardened and baked. I don't know how they make cereal. How do they make cereal?

476
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:44,300
How do you, they take, they take corn and they crush it up and like smash it up into a paste

477
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:52,659
and they like smear it over a long baking sheet and then they put it in the oven and then they

478
01:29:52,659 --> 01:29:59,210
hit it with a fucking hammer when it comes out and then they put that in a box. I don't know how they

479
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:10,300
made, I don't know how, I don't know how corn flakes are made. It's just magic. I don't know.

480
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:19,699
You're exactly right. Thank you. It's good to be right. Why is front? No, okay. Should this

481
01:30:19,699 --> 01:30:30,579
belong on the movie theater tray? They're not good, but anything compared to Sour Patch Kids

482
01:30:30,579 --> 01:30:42,789
has to be terrible. In fact, this is so bad that it almost needs its own tier because I'm afraid

483
01:30:42,789 --> 01:30:48,789
to put anything else down here because it is a direct correlation and almost competitor

484
01:30:48,869 --> 01:31:08,810
to how gross this cereal is. Okay. Carrot Cheerios. I've never had them. What is that?

485
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:17,420
Peach Cheerios. Okay. Running out of fucking fruits to like make your cereal themed after.

486
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:24,420
Fiber one. I don't eat any of these. I don't, I've never had any of them.

487
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:37,619
Never had any of them. Boys and girls. Yoink. Can I do his voice? Can I do the voice? Let me,

488
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:45,420
hey, let me, hold on. Hey kids, have some smack cereal. Oh yeah, smack cereal. Is that close?

489
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:53,060
Let's find out. How do I, I need to give me like a video right now. It's something like that.

490
01:31:53,060 --> 01:32:03,739
Everybody have one. What? Let me, I'll just do it. What? Oh, everybody have one.

491
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:31,029
Everybody got one. Smack cereal ad. Here we go. Hey, what do kids think about my catalog smacks?

492
01:32:31,029 --> 01:32:34,149
Sorry, Digga. I think we all have to agree. They look kind of weird.

493
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:39,989
Very scary. Scary looking. Honey smacks are the fun tasting part of a.

494
01:32:39,989 --> 01:32:45,880
No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not the right one. Here's another, here's, here we go.

495
01:32:45,880 --> 01:33:11,529
I had it close. No, I can't do it. It's been too long. I've been talking for too long.

496
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:27,979
Just do Mark Simpson. Pretend I did it. I had it right. Raisin Bran. I already put Raisin Bran,

497
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:34,810
but what's his frosted flakes? Banana cream. Holy, really? Get that tomorrow.

498
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:47,210
Banana cream frosted flakes. That sounds really good. Wild berry fruit loops.

499
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:51,590
You just change the food dye and that's all you did. I don't want it.

500
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:57,909
None of these. I'm not going to order them. I don't want them. These are doubles anyway,

501
01:33:57,909 --> 01:34:10,149
so don't matter. Pop tart cereal. I'm not interested. I really am not at all. I'm not interested. I'm

502
01:34:10,149 --> 01:34:27,020
not. I know people are going to be mad about that. Lucio? Lucio O's? You can, can you,

503
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:45,210
you can buy, this is like on the shelves? What are, what are they? Is it like Cheerios?

504
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:53,670
It's a gamer cereal. I've never had it and I don't think I'm going to buy it. I've never seen that

505
01:34:53,670 --> 01:35:02,489
before. That's probably only in select locations. Strawberry crispies. I kind of have to try those.

506
01:35:03,939 --> 01:35:20,819
Peeps cereal. Goodbye. Get out. Out. Out. Peep. No. Awful. Raisin bran crunch. Is that just regular

507
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:34,260
raisin bran crunch? Because it's really good if it is. I lost it. There it is. No. Where is it?

508
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:48,489
I lost it. Where'd it go? Where the fuck did it just go? Raisin bran crunch. Second row?

509
01:35:56,229 --> 01:36:08,359
That's the third row. That's not the second row. This is up here in A. It's awesome. Raisin bran.

510
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:14,340
Red, white, and blue crunch. Is this like a Fourth of July crunch?

511
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:30,359
I've never had it, but I mean it's crunch berries, right? Sprinkled donut crunch. Sprinkled don't.

512
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:40,680
All right, get that tomorrow. I want to try that. That sounds weird. What is that? Strawberry,

513
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:47,060
strawberry what? Why is this upside down? Why does it look like it's a packet that you

514
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:56,170
rip? Is this like a cereal bar? Strawberry, what does that say? Is this a cereal bar? Is this a

515
01:36:56,170 --> 01:37:10,220
cereal cereal? Yeah, no holiday crunch. That's strange. It's just a bag. Well, I don't really

516
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:15,260
want that. I don't know what that is. Strawberry cheesecake crunch or whatever. Same with this one.

517
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:24,550
What is it? Sugar cookie toast crunch. No, that's bullshit. You can't call everything French toast.

518
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:36,170
Toast crunch. Candy corn toast crunch. Sugar cookie toast crunch. French toast crunch.

519
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:43,239
Is it toast or is it a cookie? What the fuck is it? Just have it be sugar toast crunch or cookie

520
01:37:43,239 --> 01:37:51,909
toast. Sugar toast. Buttered toast crunch. That's a better name. Like why? Sugar cookie toast crunch.

521
01:37:52,550 --> 01:38:04,039
Peanut butter pops. I never had them. Hostess has a honey bun cereal. Oh, that's gross.

522
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:13,979
A bunch of mini honey buns. You've eaten one honey bun before? They're delicious and then you get a

523
01:38:13,979 --> 01:38:23,960
stomach ache. While you're eating it, it's the best thing ever, but then for some reason you just

524
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:36,890
feel bad. I'm going to try it. Wait, the little powdered doughnuts? Is this cereal? Oh my god.

525
01:38:37,529 --> 01:38:49,380
I want to try that too. I'm going to try these. Sardine toast crunch. Pumpkin spice.

526
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:57,260
No, I don't want like a latte cereal. Okay, the rest of these I haven't had, so say goodbye to

527
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:08,170
these. This is what we should be concerned with up here. Try them on stream. I mean, I could.

528
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:17,829
There's a lot there. How many cereals am I buying? I have to eliminate some for that list.

529
01:39:19,479 --> 01:39:23,319
All right, most importantly, let's see. Captain Crunch is definitely up there. Rice crispy

530
01:39:23,319 --> 01:39:34,119
treat cereal is definitely up there. Too best. French toast crunch. Honey made s'mores and

531
01:39:34,119 --> 01:39:50,630
honey smacks? I don't think belongs there. Reese's puffs I think are up there too. A high two.

532
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:10,579
I would say Captain Crunch peanut butter crunch is a superior peanut butter flavored peanut

533
01:40:10,579 --> 01:40:19,750
buttery kind of cereal than Reese's puffs. I like the flavor of the peanut butter from the Captain

534
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:31,260
Crunch one. Trix is not better than any of these. Cinnamon toast crunch is probably better than

535
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:36,539
pops. Raisin band crunch is probably better than pops. Pops is probably better than crunch berries,

536
01:40:36,539 --> 01:40:40,460
but honey smacks are probably better than crunch berries, and Trix are not better than

537
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:56,859
crunch berries. Therefore, this list is correct. Raisin band's gonna drop. Raisin brand's dropping

538
01:40:56,859 --> 01:41:04,649
down. Raisin brand crunch is already up there. This is the cooler one. Again, this is the unfinished

539
01:41:04,649 --> 01:41:35,579
one. Oh, this is regular Trix. This is fruity shapes Trix. Which one's better? Fruity shapes.

540
01:41:35,579 --> 01:42:01,180
Get this out of here. Honey nut cherry is the worst. That's a B minus though. That's still very

541
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:17,220
good. Would I put cocoa puffs in front of Frosted Flakes? No, I wouldn't. I would not. Justify Trix

542
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:24,579
being higher than a C, because Froot Loops are a C, and Trix are just a 10 times better version

543
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:39,000
of Froot Loops. It's the same cereal except that this one's just better. The reverse is true.

544
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:52,039
Thank you Concrete Car for the five community subs. I think I missed subs earlier too. I was

545
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:57,399
too engrossed. But thank you Concrete Car for the five community subs. Thank you.

546
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:07,859
Fruity Pebbles, Froot Loops, and Trix are all the same market. They're all the

547
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:15,609
sugary, fruity cereals that don't taste like fruit. They taste kind of just like candy.

548
01:43:16,409 --> 01:43:23,590
These ones taste like candy. These ones taste like bread. And these ones taste like sugary,

549
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:31,899
yummy fruits. Now do you want a bread flavored fruit snack? Or do you want, you know, like a

550
01:43:31,899 --> 01:43:55,180
candy? Or do you want a lighter, crispier, not even close? Back in the medieval days we ate

551
01:43:55,180 --> 01:44:01,739
bread cereal. No, back in the medieval days you ate like an onion and like you put an onion

552
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:07,579
into a boiling bowl of water and like ripped up a bunch of bread and put it in there too and boiled

553
01:44:07,579 --> 01:44:19,829
it for like four hours. Sometimes there'd be a rabbit in there. And that was a, that was awesome

554
01:44:19,829 --> 01:44:26,300
if you had that. That's a French onion soup. Where do you think it came from?

555
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:31,659
All right. I, I am not going to let Chad influence me. I think Trix is a very, very

556
01:44:31,659 --> 01:44:40,579
just good cereal. I would put Trix up here with, changing my mind. This belongs in front of Trix.

557
01:44:42,489 --> 01:44:46,489
It does. It really does. I'm not going to let you, I'm not going to let you guys

558
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:56,779
influence me. It's still, that went from an A minus to a B plus, vice versa. Oreo O's,

559
01:44:56,779 --> 01:45:02,140
it's just too much though. They're very good, but you can only eat one bowl of Oreo O's a week,

560
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:21,159
or it's too much. And for that reason, I'm up. But they're very, very, very good. I've never had

561
01:45:21,159 --> 01:45:28,380
these before. Why are they up here? Get them tomorrow. Banana, banana nut Cheerios, banana

562
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:42,220
cream frosted flakes. Okay. This is how I do these lists. Are Trix better than Cocoa Puffs?

563
01:45:43,979 --> 01:45:56,010
Yes or no. Are Trix better than Kix? Both got the, they've got the same name. They both

564
01:45:56,010 --> 01:46:13,050
have Ix in their name. Which one is the better Ix? Trix. Are Kix better than Honey Bunches of

565
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:18,550
Oats with strawberries? No. Are Kix better than Mini Wheats? Frosted Mini Wheats? Yes.

566
01:46:19,529 --> 01:46:24,170
Are Frosted Mini Wheats better than Honey Nut Cheerios? No. Are Frosted Mini Wheats better

567
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:35,109
than Oreo O's? Yes. There's your list. B. Done. Is Co-chocula? I don't need to say it. You just,

568
01:46:35,109 --> 01:46:53,640
you know the rule. Okay. Is Cocoa Puffs better than Lucky Charms? Yes. Is Lucky Charms better

569
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:58,680
than Honey Bunches of O's? No. Is Honey Bunches of O's better than Lucky Charms? Yes. Okay.

570
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:04,939
It was, it was the branding. The branding fucked with me. It's the branding. It's the same brand.

571
01:47:04,939 --> 01:47:10,420
It's the same thing. This is, this is a, this is a knockoff of each other. Some, you could have a

572
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:21,479
lawsuit. One of them could sue the other one. They've got the same opening mouth. They've got

573
01:47:21,479 --> 01:47:32,100
the same, like zoom in. They've got the same, like it, somebody could get sued. It's the same

574
01:47:32,100 --> 01:48:03,770
branding box that fucked up my brain. I've been on this single list for an hour. It's very important.

575
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:10,810
This is an incredibly important list. Why are Rice Krispies S.S. tier? That is Rice Krispies

576
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:16,949
Treats Cereal. That's not just regular Rice Krispies. Regular Rice Krispies is down here.

577
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:40,810
That's a Rice Krispies Treats Cereal. Okay. I think I'm happy with this. I think, yeah. Now it's

578
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:49,750
Krave is, no. Chips Ahoy. It's just Cookie Krisp, but with an exclamation point on it.

579
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:57,739
Honeycomb is good. Fruit Loops, no. Get them down here. Golden Crisp is probably better than these.

580
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:04,100
Apple Cinnamon Toast. I don't like those, but they're not, I wouldn't put them down here.

581
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:25,909
Maybe I would. I think I would. I don't eat these. Like I, I don't know why I'm putting them up here.

582
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:42,979
All right. One step at a time here. All right. So we got another thing that I just figured out

583
01:49:42,979 --> 01:49:49,270
right here. Count Chocolate is just a much better version of Lucky Charms. It's just, it's like this,

584
01:49:49,909 --> 01:50:03,500
it's like the, it's like the yin and the yang of cereals. It's, I like this one better. What are we

585
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:14,340
talking about? Count Chocolate is like little fucking pieces with marshmallows. This is little

586
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:26,949
pieces with marshmallows. They're the original little pieces with marshmallows cereal. Count

587
01:50:26,949 --> 01:50:34,310
Chocula had the, the, the crispy little like bready pieces and the marshmallows. Lucky Charms had the

588
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:42,500
crispy little bready pieces in the marshmallows. What other cereal had that? What other cereal had

589
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:55,060
the marshmallows with the, the crispy puffs? Those are the two originals. One of them's chocolate.

590
01:50:55,699 --> 01:50:59,140
Yeah. That's why I said it's, it's like the opposite, but they're like this, they're the

591
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:10,220
same like cereal, but one is opposite of the other. It's like a mirror. These are the original

592
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:17,220
fucking characters. Yeah. They've, yeah. They've got like, they add marshmallows to every cereal now.

593
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:22,920
Oh dear. Fruity Pebbles with marshmallows. Oh, Frosted Flakes with marshmallows.

594
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:37,380
This is the original too. Sorry guys. That's the way it is. I like the, this one better. Donut

595
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:48,100
Steel? What's Donut Steel? Imagine thinking Kix is a B, but Fruity Pebbles is a D.

596
01:51:57,399 --> 01:52:05,479
It's the soggiest fucking cereal in the world. I wanted to do a third party test to see what

597
01:52:05,479 --> 01:52:24,100
the soggiest damn cereal is. It's going to be Fruity Pebbles. I like my cereal soggy. It's,

598
01:52:25,319 --> 01:52:36,810
is this your tier list? Whose tier list is this? I like it like this. Whose list is this?

599
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:45,659
It's my list. This is not your list. Go make your list. I would love to see it. This is my

600
01:52:45,659 --> 01:52:50,550
cereal list. I don't like my cereal soggy. Therefore Fruity Pebbles is down here. What's,

601
01:52:50,550 --> 01:53:09,939
what's going on here? Whose list is this? Getting me heated over fucking sugar in a box.

602
01:53:10,579 --> 01:53:23,829
It's all dog shit anyways. From A to B, from S to D, these are all, you don't eat a banana.

603
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:29,270
Eat a fucking fruit. Have a salad for breakfast. Don't eat these. Don't eat Cocoa Puffs for

604
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:37,829
breakfast. What the fuck? Why would you do that? Eat an apple. Eat a pear. They're all like the same

605
01:53:37,829 --> 01:53:45,399
tier. Just stretched out a little. See these, these aren't even on here. Because I'm a degenerate

606
01:53:45,399 --> 01:53:52,170
fuck that doesn't eat the good ones. This, this is like just an accordion of bad cereals.

607
01:53:52,810 --> 01:54:10,100
And that's why I, the Captain Crunch is the best. Cut his bike. I got blueberries on this list. Okay.

608
01:54:10,819 --> 01:54:15,859
If you want to criticize something, criticize the fact that I don't eat like whole grain cereals.

609
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:23,699
All like these good nice whole grain oat cereals are down at the fucking bottom. I've never had

610
01:54:23,699 --> 01:54:32,579
them, but I've eaten the fucking Captain Crunch entourage like a thousand times. Somebody just

611
01:54:32,579 --> 01:54:44,699
gave subs. Thank you modest narcissist for the five community subs. Like brand flakes.

612
01:54:47,579 --> 01:54:54,939
You should be more concerned at my, like I am between the ages of eight and thirteen cereals.

613
01:54:56,579 --> 01:55:04,539
We, that, that should be more concerning. Actually, well honey, honey, not Cheerios.

614
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:12,060
And regular Cheerios, if I was a responsible functioning adult would be up here.

615
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:34,229
But no, it's down here. Anyways, I'm going to go on with my cereal list. That just made me think

616
01:55:34,229 --> 01:55:40,470
about my health a little bit. So these are going to get bumped up a little. That made me concerned

617
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:46,359
about my list. Just wanted to move them up just a little bit because I'm a little concerned about

618
01:55:46,359 --> 01:55:52,859
my health now about like Crunch Berry, Captain Crunch. It makes up at least every top tier

619
01:55:52,859 --> 01:56:04,149
at least once. I probably should bump up multi-grain Cheerios a little. Yeah, pops are on here.

620
01:56:04,149 --> 01:56:09,430
Come on. Putting higher cereals up on your list is not going to improve your health.

621
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:17,079
All right. Now that we've cleared that up, we've gotten that out of the way. Let's, let's continue.

622
01:56:24,069 --> 01:56:29,659
Put these on the order list because I don't want them. Oreos at B is a travesty.

623
01:56:37,829 --> 01:57:02,470
I'm drinking coffee at 10 o'clock at night. Health. I know you, I know you love some of these cereals.

624
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:17,590
I do too. And for that reason, I'm just, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. D tier. Now,

625
01:57:17,590 --> 01:57:24,920
Lucky Charms really is not that good. Multi-grain Cheerios and Cornflakes are definitely not better

626
01:57:26,649 --> 01:57:32,500
than, than Raisin Brin. Cornflakes actually should be somewhere down here.

627
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:51,720
Crave should be down here. I think this is the new recipe. I don't like it. All right. I'm happy

628
01:57:51,720 --> 01:58:06,359
with this. Now I am. Now I am. Now I'm, now, now I'm happy with this. Now I am. Yeah, I think so.

629
01:58:06,359 --> 01:58:13,380
Okay. This is the D list. This is cereals that I, I still think are all right, but I don't really

630
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:18,579
buy because they're just, they're too much of a pain in the ass to eat or they're too bland for me.

631
01:58:55,539 --> 01:59:05,000
Guys, I gotta say something here. Real important. I put Fruity Pebbles down on the D list.

632
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:30,569
I didn't scream in your mother's face. It's, it's the same. I took, I'm finishing my list.

633
01:59:33,369 --> 01:59:40,140
Wheaties. They're fine. Coconut. Fruity Pebbles. I don't want them. I don't want these. What are

634
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:50,039
they? Oh, the Tweedledee and Tweedledum. They can stay where they are. Golden Grahams. Probably a

635
01:59:50,039 --> 01:59:54,890
little bit better. Probably Golden Grahams is probably better than all these. You know what?

636
01:59:55,449 --> 02:00:02,729
Golden Grahams is definitely better than all of these two. I, I was, I went, I jumped that too

637
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:09,060
quick. Golden Grahams is really, really good. The only issue I have is like they get soggy in 10

638
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:13,380
seconds, but the 10 seconds that you get to eat them, they're fucking, they're really, they're good.

639
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:25,050
It belongs up here. Why is Cheerios a D? No, no, it belongs there. That's like D minus though.

640
02:00:26,229 --> 02:00:30,789
I would probably rather eat Cheerios. Yeah, I'd rather eat Cheerios than Frosted Cheerios.

641
02:00:31,829 --> 02:00:51,939
Hell-conscious guy. Notice how, noticing pattern. I just don't really like Cheerios.

642
02:00:54,310 --> 02:01:01,140
Really that much at all. Rice Krispies are probably better than these two meme cereals.

643
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:19,020
It's weird because I've probably eaten these two cereals less than the amount of times I've seen

644
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:30,090
it on Adult Swim. So there's, there's a reason why it's down here. Apple Jacks is A tier.

645
02:01:38,550 --> 02:02:06,520
For you, maybe. But hmm. Foot Captain Crunch in the trash tier. Where's the Mario cereal? The

646
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:17,350
Mario cereal wasn't on here. If you watch the commercial for Apple Jacks, it'll be S tier.

647
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:29,479
I think that's the list. I think that's it. These, this is a pretty, look,

648
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:34,840
look at the first three rows. The, here's the thing. Everybody's first two or three rows are

649
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:41,750
going to be kind of similar. Everybody, every other cereal in like B to D is super personal

650
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:47,689
opinion. It's all just personal opinion, right? Everybody fucking knows. Everybody on earth knows

651
02:02:47,689 --> 02:02:52,170
that Cinnamon Toast Crunch is a great cereal. Raisin Bran Crunch is a great cereal. Pops,

652
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:56,250
Smacks, Crunch Berries, Frosted Flakes, these are all A. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that.

653
02:02:56,890 --> 02:03:05,960
This down here is what you get to, like personal opinion. Pops is a, how could you not, Pops,

654
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:13,420
Pops is one of the most unique cereals. It's, Honey Smacks and Pops are not just

655
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:19,100
toasted fucking corn with marshmallows in it. It's not just like a circle that tastes like bread.

656
02:03:19,819 --> 02:03:24,460
Honey Smacks tastes wildly different than anything else. Pops tastes really wildly different than

657
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:29,479
anything else. Captain Crunch tastes wildly different than anything. Let me tell you what

658
02:03:29,479 --> 02:03:34,520
cereals taste exactly the same, okay? Ready for me to blow up this whole scenario here?

659
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:49,819
These are the cereals that taste exact identical to each other. Ready? These, one, two, these two.

660
02:03:49,819 --> 02:03:54,140
You know, the idea is that they all taste, they all taste pretty similar except for like three of

661
02:03:54,140 --> 02:04:04,170
them. These two, these two, these three, these like four, all the Cheerios that have different

662
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:09,109
like fucking seasoning packets on them. It's still Cheerios. They still taste the same. This is just

663
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:15,449
a mirror. Look, they taste different. That's all I need to know. Crave is too low. All right,

664
02:04:15,449 --> 02:04:24,760
you know, somebody said Crave is too low. It's going up here. Honey Smacks tastes

665
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:50,739
different than anything else. Do a cigarette tier list. Oh yeah, marbles. They're all belonging to

666
02:04:50,739 --> 02:04:56,920
trash. Can I put them all down here? All right, please, can we just agree? Can we agree on

667
02:04:56,920 --> 02:05:02,569
something? This is, guys, this is a cereal list. This is like British Parliament right now.

668
02:05:03,130 --> 02:05:08,090
Can we all agree on one thing? Sour Patch Kids cereals should be removed from shelves.

669
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:19,829
Like we, come on, like why would it be there? That's like why? And peeps, that's what, no.

670
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:39,590
And these are just not very good. But Sour Patch Kids, we can all agree on that. I'm good. I got

671
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:46,359
my list. I'm happy with it. I think it's good for me. That's my, those are my favorite cereals.

672
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:57,670
In the comments section below, write out your favorite cereals. What is this? Annoying Orange

673
02:05:57,670 --> 02:06:17,000
characters. I'm not doing that one. Pasta rankings. Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavors. I don't think

674
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:23,340
I've had enough of them to be able to give an opinion. Fruit tier list. All right, do you

675
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:31,460
got a fruit? I'll give you the fruit tier list. I will. What is it? Is there actually like a big,

676
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:37,539
a nice good fruit tier list? I'll do it. I'm gonna do it quick. Jelly Belly flavors. Don't even need

677
02:06:37,539 --> 02:06:44,020
the list. Every single one F. Toasted Marshmallow S. Pick them all out and put the other, like just

678
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:48,180
give them to somebody else for like a present. Take, here's the tactic. Take out all the toasted

679
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:54,199
marshmallow ones, eat them, reseal it and give it to somebody for a present. All right, fruit tier

680
02:06:54,199 --> 02:07:02,630
list. I'm getting linked to a lot of these. Give me the one with like the most amount of options.

681
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:15,659
Okay, let's link that. All right, this is apparently for, get a screenshot of that.

682
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:19,180
Oh, you know, get a screenshot of that because I get a screenshot of this because I need to know

683
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:25,909
what I'm gonna get tomorrow. Especially this part. The list is too big. So now that you got that

684
02:07:25,909 --> 02:07:33,720
screenshot, thank you. Here's the actual list. There you go. Okay, this is fruits coming up.

685
02:07:39,380 --> 02:08:02,470
Okay, this one shouldn't be too hard. This is only mainstream fruits. I didn't, I wasn't aware that

686
02:08:02,470 --> 02:08:09,220
they were underground. It's like indie dev fruits. Sorry, these are, well we're only doing AAA fruits

687
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:24,789
today. Okay, I am a citrus kind of guy. People are gonna get so mad about this stuff.

688
02:08:27,529 --> 02:08:39,180
I'm just like opening up all avenues of attack is what I'm doing. Boy, hold on a minute. This is

689
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:47,779
important. Is this eating the fruit? Or is this the flavor of the fruit? Well, is it eating the

690
02:08:47,779 --> 02:08:58,869
fruit? Because some fruits taste all right, but they're gross to me. Eating it. Okay, fuck,

691
02:08:58,869 --> 02:09:03,989
because I think I love oranges. I love orange juice. I just, I don't like eating an orange.

692
02:09:03,989 --> 02:09:09,189
I think they're disgusting eating them. You get like orange gristle. I hate oranges. I hate eating

693
02:09:09,189 --> 02:09:24,489
oranges. The white like gristle. That's gonna change everything. I'm gonna go with flavor.

694
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:39,479
Like the way that it tastes. I don't, what's this one? Is that a tomato? What is that? I don't know

695
02:09:39,479 --> 02:10:06,380
what that fruit is. It's a pumpkin. That's not a pumpkin. Lemons are the best fruits.

696
02:10:07,989 --> 02:10:13,979
Lemon is fucking unbelievable. Guess what? So is, no I'm changing that. Pineapple is my favorite

697
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:19,909
fruit. Lemon is my favorite like fruit flavor. Lemon and water. A squeeze of lemon. Lemon

698
02:10:19,909 --> 02:10:27,670
flavoring. That like tart, sour, citrusy lemon flavor is my favorite flavor besides pineapple.

699
02:10:34,899 --> 02:10:47,720
I am a, I am a, I'm a like kind of fruit guy. It's got to be like citrusy and fresh,

700
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:55,579
refreshing. I'm gonna make a lot of people mad with a couple of these. Disgusting. Absolutely

701
02:10:55,579 --> 02:11:05,380
fucking revolting. Not because these, how many times, eating berries. You, it's like eating sand.

702
02:11:06,329 --> 02:11:13,050
You crunch on this like, like a fucking hard sand. Try and blend them up. It doesn't work.

703
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:18,489
You're drinking sand. You're eating sand. Those seeds in berries are the most obnoxious things.

704
02:11:18,489 --> 02:11:29,100
It's like eating fucking popcorn kernels. You said flavor. I did say flavor, but sometimes you

705
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:33,579
got to think about like the horrible experiences you've had. I've had a horrible experience eating

706
02:11:33,579 --> 02:11:38,220
blackberries before, right, over raspberries. What are these? Yeah, I've had a horrible experience

707
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:52,859
eating these. Flavor-wise, they're good, but I can't. I'm gonna leave them there for now.

708
02:11:55,130 --> 02:12:05,380
Cherries. Bananas. Bananas and smoothies are amazing. Bananas, they're great. I love letting

709
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:11,020
bananas rot, almost to the point where they're rotting, and then eat them. Some of you people

710
02:12:11,020 --> 02:12:15,739
will know what I'm talking about. Some of you guys here will know. Right before the banana starts to

711
02:12:15,739 --> 02:12:34,939
get really, really kind of ripe, overripe, is when I'd like to eat them the most. Uh, and by the way,

712
02:12:34,939 --> 02:12:47,880
where's your mother? Because I'm gonna scream in her face. What are these? Watermelon. Ew,

713
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:52,359
ew, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross. Worst. How do I have, no, where's the worst? I gotta make like,

714
02:12:52,359 --> 02:13:00,500
disgusting tier. I have to make awful tier. Add a row below. No, no, no, no, no. Disg- awful, awful,

715
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:07,270
awful. Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. F. Grapefruits taste like stomach acid.

716
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:21,859
You know how, so my mother used to eat these. My mother would cut a grapefruit in half,

717
02:13:22,579 --> 02:13:27,460
and she would put a little, uh, spork with, you know, the spoon that has little, little, uh,

718
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:31,939
ridges on top, and she would eat it half a grapefruit. And it's like, oh, okay, you're

719
02:13:31,939 --> 02:13:37,220
gonna eat half a grapefruit. But every time before she went in with it, you know, went in with the

720
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:44,300
spoon, she would cover the top of the half with sugar. And apparently that was like the way to

721
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:52,340
make it taste like, worth eating out of the half. If you have to add sugar to fruit, I don't think

722
02:13:52,340 --> 02:14:02,220
it's worth eating. You have to add something on top. Well, it would only taste good if I put

723
02:14:02,220 --> 02:14:06,810
fucking a bunch of salt on it. No. Grapefruit juice is also disgusting.

724
02:14:11,449 --> 02:14:24,939
I'm sorry, I'm upsetting a lot of people, but that's the way it is. Where's kiwi? Done. What is this

725
02:14:24,939 --> 02:14:37,960
corn? What is that? Lime? Weirdly enough, lime not as good as lemon to me. Belongs up there. What is

726
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:46,649
that, coconut? Actually, I hate coconut. I love coconut juice. I like coconut milk, coconut water,

727
02:14:46,649 --> 02:14:58,789
but coconut. I don't really like coconut eating it. It's gonna be bad. What the fuck is this?

728
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:12,359
Is it ice cream? Is that Oreo? Is that cookies and cream ice cream? I've never, I've never eaten that.

729
02:15:15,479 --> 02:15:22,899
Grapes? Grapes can be up here as long as they're frozen. I don't like eating regular grapes.

730
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:28,100
If they're frozen, I like them. But the reason why I don't like eating grapes is because my brother

731
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:32,899
told me a story one time about how, uh, watch out when you eat grapes because there could be

732
02:15:32,899 --> 02:15:42,619
spiders in them. And that just freaked me out enough to put them down to be. But frozen grapes,

733
02:15:42,619 --> 02:16:03,739
I think are amazing. Strawberry? Eh. Are you ready to have everybody hate me? I'm gonna get off camera

734
02:16:03,739 --> 02:16:32,500
for this one. Apples suck. There's only one apple that I actually will eat willingly, and that's a

735
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:54,739
Macintosh apple. Soft flesh apples. I heard something over there. What was that? It has to

736
02:16:54,739 --> 02:17:04,840
be crispy. I don't look, I don't like apple pie. I don't like apple fritters. I don't like apple

737
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:12,870
jacks. I don't like cinnamon apple cereal. I don't like apple. I don't like apple pie. I don't like

738
02:17:12,870 --> 02:17:18,469
anything with cooked apples in it because every time I eat something with cooked apples, if it's

739
02:17:18,469 --> 02:17:24,469
apple pie, oh, whoa, oozy, yummy, hot apple pie. I love that filling until you get the piece of the

740
02:17:24,469 --> 02:17:31,270
apple and it's like an old person sucking up a fucking prune. It's like a slippery slug, a hot

741
02:17:31,270 --> 02:17:41,739
slug that you... No, disgusting. I don't like that. I don't like it. I'm sorry. I'll eat Macintosh

742
02:17:41,739 --> 02:17:52,600
apples. I like blueberry iced coffee. Blueberries are right here. I just put it at A. Hot apples

743
02:17:52,600 --> 02:18:03,770
taste like a warm slug. I don't want to eat, I don't want to do that. I would eat a Macintosh

744
02:18:03,770 --> 02:18:09,430
apple right now if you brought it in here. I'd be like, okay, this is great. I like this. I like

745
02:18:09,430 --> 02:18:21,239
being able to like, and it's pretty juicy and flows down your face. I will say the green apples

746
02:18:21,239 --> 02:18:40,840
are better than red apples. Melon, listen, melon is the fruit that you dig around in the fruit cup

747
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:48,709
to eat the fruit that you want to eat. Once you run out of the good ones, you go,

748
02:18:49,510 --> 02:19:01,620
oh, well, I guess there's melon in here. I just, I just saw it for the first time tonight. I saw

749
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:28,360
go to hell. Go to hell. What is this? Oh, is this a Clementine? Tangerine. All right. This is

750
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:48,149
important. Nectarine. Oh, this is peach. This one's nectarine, right? Nectarine belongs up here.

751
02:19:48,149 --> 02:19:57,770
Peach is really close behind. In fact, nectarine may have to take the spot of watermelon.

752
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:05,829
Nectarines are incredible. You want, remember I told you like the Macintosh apple, when you bite

753
02:20:05,829 --> 02:20:12,280
into it, it's like that, if you get a ripe nectarine, the thing, it's as if somebody

754
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:21,350
fucking just like sprayed, like sprayed a hose in your face. It's like, it's incredible. It's,

755
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:27,350
it's okay. Nectarines are what gushers the fruit snack we're trying to emulate very poorly, very

756
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:36,659
badly. You get that like super soft bite with that flow of like fruit juice down into your mouth.

757
02:20:36,659 --> 02:20:40,180
Oh my God. I'm good. Where's the list that I can put this on and get these tomorrow at the grocery

758
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:48,969
store? Peaches are gross. Peaches are not, I don't think peaches are as good as nectarines.

759
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:54,020
I still think they're good though. Sometimes I pretend to be like a bee when I eat them too.

760
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:58,899
Like this is like, this is, this is what like a bee did this. And I'm like taste, I'm like eating

761
02:20:58,979 --> 02:21:09,879
like nature bee. Like I'm a bee, like a nectar. Pears, it depends on what kind of pear, but I

762
02:21:09,879 --> 02:21:16,790
usually like pears. Pears are better than apples. I don't know if I, yeah, pears, I probably eat

763
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:28,899
blueberries over pears. The rest of these, I don't know what these are. This is other orange. This is,

764
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:37,819
I don't know what that is. What is this one? Is it papaya? This is a mango? Which one's a mango?

765
02:21:41,399 --> 02:21:48,760
What's the corn one? It's a permission, permission, permission. What is it?

766
02:21:58,069 --> 02:22:05,049
I don't, I don't really, I'm not like into it. Mango and papaya, which one of these is which?

767
02:22:06,709 --> 02:22:13,670
I like mango salsa. I don't eat mangoes though. A little too slimy for me, a little too slippery

768
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:19,030
and slimy. When you like cut into, you have like mango slices, it's like covered in ice. You like

769
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:28,389
pick it up, it just slips out of you, it's too slimy and slippery. I do like, I do like, I need

770
02:22:28,389 --> 02:22:42,340
some more down at sea. Okay, let's do it. Best fruit on earth is a pineapple. Fresh cored pineapple

771
02:22:43,450 --> 02:22:53,190
that is ripe. It cannot be compared to anything, anything. It's every single thing you want in a

772
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:59,190
fruit. It's really good for you. It's really fucking delicious. It's got an incredibly distinct flavor

773
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:04,100
and it has an enzyme in it that eats your fucking flesh from the inside out.

774
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:16,090
Fucking sick. That's like cool. Bad ass, right? Kiwis on the other hand are lighter. I could eat

775
02:23:16,090 --> 02:23:21,690
like five of these and be like, oh that was pretty good. Cut them up into little tiny thin slices,

776
02:23:21,690 --> 02:23:27,510
like I'm talking like deli thin. Lay them out and just pick them up and eat them like little

777
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:34,709
cucumbers. They're great. You can eat the skin. I don't, too fuzzy, too, too fuzzy for me.

778
02:23:35,819 --> 02:23:46,840
But I do love kiwis, so I think that that's good for me. Two of the best fruits. Lemons is just

779
02:23:46,840 --> 02:23:51,879
top tier flavor for me. I would put nectarine in front of it, but I'm not going to because I

780
02:23:52,760 --> 02:24:00,459
drink lemon water all the time. If I drink a glass of water, I usually have a little lemon squeezer

781
02:24:00,459 --> 02:24:04,940
and I just squeeze like a half a lemon in the water and drink it sometimes, maybe like once in a while.

782
02:24:05,899 --> 02:24:08,299
I just like that. I like the taste. I like the way it makes you feel.

783
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:19,479
Where do plums go? Plums are down here, but they might not be there forever. This is just

784
02:24:19,479 --> 02:24:26,579
a preliminary. I had to do it. So yeah, watermelons. As you can tell by this list,

785
02:24:26,579 --> 02:24:33,350
I'm really into those fruits that are really easy to bite into. So you bite into them and

786
02:24:33,350 --> 02:24:36,950
your teeth just kind of melt right there. It's like having like meat off the bone, like a barb,

787
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:47,319
like a smoked brisket. These two are the smoked brisket of the fruit world. It's tender,

788
02:24:47,319 --> 02:24:54,139
your teeth go right through it, and it's just juicy and delicious. Yes, that's why they're up

789
02:24:54,139 --> 02:25:01,270
here. Peach is pretty close, but I like nectarines better than peach. We already described that. This

790
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:07,270
is tangerines. I would probably put tangerines down this way. More close. No, this is orange.

791
02:25:07,989 --> 02:25:15,209
Tangerines are already down there. I like orange probably more than banana, but I like blueberry

792
02:25:15,209 --> 02:25:19,610
more than I like banana, and I like banana more than I like pear. Strawberry and lime.

793
02:25:20,809 --> 02:25:29,129
This is where you get into... I like it. I would eat it every day. I would. I would eat any of

794
02:25:29,129 --> 02:25:38,540
these pretty much any day. Cherries, too much work. You know what I mean? Too much work. You

795
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:44,379
got to eat it. You don't swallow the fucking seed. There's a giant core in the middle,

796
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:49,739
and you got to work around it, and then spit it out. What do you do with it? Spit it out in your

797
02:25:49,739 --> 02:26:00,950
hand? Too much work. I'm not like a big cherry flavor kind of person. Just pull it out on your

798
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:13,379
date. Oh, so what is it that you do for work again? I'm a scientist. I work for NASA. What?

799
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:21,260
No, come on. What is this one again? I don't remember. That's why it's down here. It's a

800
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:26,100
mango, papaya. Decent flavoring. I like the flavorings better than these.

801
02:26:30,489 --> 02:26:43,610
Look, seed does not mean bad. Seed does not mean bad. Seed is fine. I like cherry coke,

802
02:26:45,139 --> 02:26:55,059
and I like grenadine syrup, but that's bullshit tier. That's not real. Now here we go.

803
02:26:58,700 --> 02:27:03,979
Raspberries are definitely... I really don't even know what the cookies and cream thing

804
02:27:03,979 --> 02:27:08,620
even tastes like, so I can't even really put it on the list, but it's not F because I don't

805
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:18,549
really know. I definitely would rather eat all of these before I would eat an apple.

806
02:27:21,379 --> 02:27:27,299
You gave me a choice. You said, hey, here's a bunch of raspberries or apples. Eat one.

807
02:27:27,299 --> 02:27:40,309
I would be like, oh, raspberry. I'll take one. I avoid these at all costs. In fact,

808
02:27:40,309 --> 02:28:01,209
that's how it should look. I think that's pretty accurate for me. Where's the pomegranate? It's not

809
02:28:01,209 --> 02:28:04,729
on this list. Although pomegranate would be somewhere in front of cherry because I feel

810
02:28:04,729 --> 02:28:12,299
like they're like... Plus pomegranate, the inside of it looks fucking weird. It's weird. It's like

811
02:28:12,299 --> 02:28:18,059
a bunch of strange scattered egg sacs inside with seeds in it, like spiders. There's spiders in

812
02:28:18,059 --> 02:28:21,979
there. Those could be spider eggs. That's all I know. My brother told me that one time. That's

813
02:28:21,979 --> 02:28:32,440
why I can't eat it. Okay, so there it is. Any more brain busters? Cheeses? I'll do cheeses.

814
02:28:33,079 --> 02:28:42,100
How long is this stream? We're still going. Have I eaten enough cheeses for this to work?

815
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:54,979
I'm not going to do annoying orange characters. They're all annoying. Is there just one bar that

816
02:28:54,979 --> 02:29:04,469
just is annoying on it? Do soda. I could all do soda. Give me a good soda one. Chips? We'll do

817
02:29:04,469 --> 02:29:20,389
soda. I'm talking a good soda one. Let's check this one out. Soda. That was fruits. Here comes

818
02:29:20,389 --> 02:29:35,079
soda. Oh, this is a lot. Okay, I do appreciate they have it all set up already. The trash and

819
02:29:35,079 --> 02:29:43,530
I don't care. I haven't had it. I don't care. Let's go. This is... I don't think I've had that,

820
02:29:43,530 --> 02:29:49,540
but I love 7-Up. 7-Up I think is better than Sprite by a pretty decent margin, I think.

821
02:29:50,260 --> 02:30:03,379
Dr. Pepper has fallen off from me in recent years. A&W root beer is the best root beer. Cream soda,

822
02:30:03,379 --> 02:30:11,639
I used to love it, but I think it's disgusting now. When I was 15, 16, 17 years old, I was obsessed

823
02:30:11,639 --> 02:30:19,719
with this stuff. But now it almost just tastes like... it just tastes like they got halfway

824
02:30:19,719 --> 02:30:25,299
through and they stopped making the soda. They added the water, the carbonation, and a bunch of

825
02:30:25,299 --> 02:30:29,219
sugar caramely kind of sugar flavor, and then they didn't. They stopped. There needs to be

826
02:30:29,219 --> 02:30:38,889
something else. It's weird. It doesn't do it for me anymore. Barks root beer. I don't know if it's

827
02:30:38,889 --> 02:30:45,100
better than A&W, but it's still all right. That's how we drink it. Barks is good. Is this some water?

828
02:30:45,819 --> 02:31:02,100
What is that? This is just water? If it's water, then I'm gonna... I'm just gonna pretend this is

829
02:31:02,100 --> 02:31:12,969
water. It belongs up here. I have an ad. I don't know what that is. There's no way you could never

830
02:31:12,969 --> 02:31:19,129
in your whole life have never tried water. You getting water accidentally in your mouth in the

831
02:31:19,129 --> 02:31:26,969
shower counts. There's no way anyone's never had water. You'd be dead. You would just die.

832
02:31:27,610 --> 02:31:33,780
You would just turn into bones. It'd be dead. I don't really know what that is, so it's off the

833
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:40,860
list. Is this iced tea? I wish there was like a zoom in button. What is this? Is this iced tea?

834
02:31:44,629 --> 02:32:03,819
This is not breast milk. I like... What does it say? It's called balls? I don't know what this is.

835
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:11,579
Balls. I don't... I don't know what this is either. Canada Dry ginger ale goes up here. I'm... This

836
02:32:11,579 --> 02:32:30,139
is gonna be a deliberation here. It's gonna take me a while. Oh, fuck. Uh-oh. This is the real one

837
02:32:30,139 --> 02:33:10,729
right here. Where does Pepsi go? Coke's better than Pepsi. Sorry. Like 44% of you now think that

838
02:33:10,729 --> 02:33:21,459
I'm like talking to the devil every night before I go to bed. I now pray to the devil every night

839
02:33:21,459 --> 02:33:37,370
before I go to sleep. To half of you guys know. Is this like steak sauce? Dads? Uh, no. Cherry

840
02:33:37,370 --> 02:33:43,110
Coke? Not as good as regular Coke. Um, this is like... What is this? Like espresso Coke?

841
02:33:43,829 --> 02:33:54,440
I don't think I've ever had that. Get this shit out of here. Stop drinking this. Honest to God.

842
02:33:55,670 --> 02:34:04,329
Get the fuck out of here. Diet fucking Coke. Diet Pepsi. Just... No. Get... Don't stop. Don't...

843
02:34:04,329 --> 02:34:15,610
Don't drink them anymore. No. A&W cream soda is better than this. Don't drink that anymore.

844
02:34:16,170 --> 02:34:23,879
Like, I'm looking out for your health. Anymore diet sodas on this list? Do you see any? Because

845
02:34:23,879 --> 02:34:36,569
they're going in the trash. These are just... These are fucking awful too. The Minute Maid

846
02:34:37,209 --> 02:34:47,430
lemonade in the fucking jar. No, no, no. They're bad. No. These lemonades in the fucking... That

847
02:34:47,430 --> 02:34:54,620
come out of the bottle are so over sweetened. It tastes like syrup. It's like lemon syrup. It's

848
02:34:54,620 --> 02:35:00,059
not even like fucking... It's not even like drinking like refreshing, like, quencher. It's syrup.

849
02:35:01,690 --> 02:35:07,209
You could cut this like three times. This is a lemonade concentrate. That's not lemonade.

850
02:35:07,209 --> 02:35:15,379
You can make four lemonades out of this. Tastes good, but just save some money. Buy one of those

851
02:35:15,379 --> 02:35:19,700
and then just cut it with water. Like at least 40% of it. It'll... You'll be like, oh wow, that's not

852
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:24,969
even that much of a difference. Trying to say I'm looking out for you. But both of them...

853
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:40,219
If this were... If this were younger teenage me, this would be up here. I am a sucker for

854
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:46,840
Shirley Temples. Mountain Dew Code Red is as close to a bottled Shirley Temple as you can get.

855
02:35:49,049 --> 02:35:57,540
I love... If Shirley Temple was on here, I would put it up an S tier. They're so good,

856
02:35:57,540 --> 02:36:02,620
but they're just so bad for you. But this is probably... Probably truly belongs somewhere down

857
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:15,350
here. Sprite. I actually prefer Sprite over any of the other amber drinks at this point,

858
02:36:16,819 --> 02:36:20,579
besides root beer. Like I said, Dr. Pepper has fallen off a little bit for me.

859
02:36:21,299 --> 02:36:37,899
This is... These are meme sodas. I don't want them. What is... Is this the same thing? Is this

860
02:36:37,899 --> 02:36:41,340
vanilla Coke? Isn't this vanilla Coke too? They're both the same one, right?

861
02:36:46,649 --> 02:36:53,770
Is this one different? Wait, is this the orange Coke? Is this the orange one? If it's the orange

862
02:36:53,770 --> 02:36:59,079
one, it's going somewhere very specific. This is Coke Orange? Confirmed? This is Coke... Confirmed

863
02:36:59,079 --> 02:37:19,049
Coke Orange? Confirmed Coke Orange? It's awful. Pepsi's already up there. RC Cola is... May as

864
02:37:19,049 --> 02:37:24,520
well just be the same thing as all the other ones. But it's like the worst one of them all, I guess.

865
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:30,649
But it's cheaper though, right? Maybe I would drink it. Mellow Yellow is Mountain Dew.

866
02:37:31,290 --> 02:37:47,270
And speaking of Mountain Dew, do you know where this has gone? Into the trash. This other Mountain

867
02:37:47,270 --> 02:38:06,709
Dew. Crush Orange Soda. Somewhere up here. Sierra Mist. Somewhere up here. I don't know. What does

868
02:38:06,709 --> 02:38:19,180
this one say? I don't... What's this one? Chucky Cheese? Chucky Cheese Soda? Wait, this is Baja?

869
02:38:19,180 --> 02:38:35,879
This is Baja Blast? That's... It's better. It's good. Zoom in. No, I'm trying to exercise my eyes.

870
02:38:37,659 --> 02:38:43,739
Chucky Cheese Soda. I've never had it. Fanta. Fanta is just kind of Orange Crush, but it's...

871
02:38:44,379 --> 02:38:47,819
They're both essentially identical. There's no differences. I think one of them is a little

872
02:38:47,819 --> 02:38:53,479
more syrupy. I think Fanta is a little syrupy for me. So I'll probably put it down. I don't

873
02:38:53,479 --> 02:38:59,909
think I really want it. I'd rather get a Crush. I really don't like a Grape Soda. If I'm going

874
02:38:59,909 --> 02:39:03,350
to get a Crush, it's going to be the Orange variant, not the Grape one. So I'm not a big fan

875
02:39:03,350 --> 02:39:08,469
of Orange Grape Soda. I don't know what this is. This looks like Strawberry Soda, but I've never

876
02:39:08,469 --> 02:39:15,260
had it. Jolt Cola. Don't drink it. Stop being fucking aware of it. Is this Cigarette Ashes in

877
02:39:15,260 --> 02:39:30,280
Water? Oh, no. It's IVC Root Beer? Is this the Cream Soda? I haven't had this one before.

878
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:36,680
IVC Root Beer, though, is pretty good. I don't know if it's better than like... It's probably

879
02:39:36,680 --> 02:39:42,680
on the same level as Barks. And these should be down a little more. I think I would rather

880
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:49,909
have like a Vanilla Coke than like a Root Beer. Although, I would probably... I would rather have...

881
02:39:50,629 --> 02:39:54,870
Now, wait a minute. This is very specific. It's not in the can. I would rather have the Glass

882
02:39:54,870 --> 02:40:03,540
Bottle IVC Root Beer than the can of Coke. I think so, because that doesn't come in a can.

883
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:13,659
Yeah, I would put normal vanilla in the trash. I like vanilla. What's wrong with vanilla Coke?

884
02:40:13,659 --> 02:40:17,819
I like it. It's good. I don't drink it all the time, but sometimes you just... you're looking

885
02:40:17,819 --> 02:40:26,649
for it and you want it. Squirt has not been available, I don't think, for like 25 years, so

886
02:40:28,379 --> 02:40:44,659
Surge is another meme soda. I've never had it. Why is this an eBay listing? That's the best picture

887
02:40:44,659 --> 02:41:02,040
you can find? Storm Soda. I've never had it. Mellow Yellow is... I think it's better than Mountain Dew,

888
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:05,399
but not by very much. I don't think it's better. Hold on. It's definitely better than this.

889
02:41:06,739 --> 02:41:16,889
It's the Star Wars flavor. The rest of these are kind of the same... wait, but it's bottles. Ah,

890
02:41:17,610 --> 02:41:23,399
I get it. Yeah, all right. So I'd rather have a bottle of Coke than a can of Coke.

891
02:41:25,159 --> 02:41:33,370
Bottom tier for me is plastic bottles. Plastic Bottle Coke. Plastic Bottle Pepsi

892
02:41:34,250 --> 02:41:47,559
is F tier. Can Coke, Bottle Coke is better for me. Plastic Bottle... no, I just... if I can...

893
02:41:47,559 --> 02:41:56,489
I don't want it. It's going in the trash. I would never... I cannot think of any scenario ever,

894
02:41:57,909 --> 02:42:13,879
and I mean actually ever, that I would buy a Plastic Bottle Pepsi. I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it.

895
02:42:13,879 --> 02:42:17,479
That has to go in the trash. It's... I mean, Pepsi is obviously... I would drink Pepsi.

896
02:42:19,020 --> 02:42:25,020
I wouldn't avoid Pepsi. That's fine. Whatever. But I'm not going to buy a plastic fucking bottle of

897
02:42:25,020 --> 02:42:33,219
Pepsi. Look at chat. What? You have vanilla Coke in the trash. The one next to Coke is regular

898
02:42:33,219 --> 02:42:50,250
caffeine free. I thought this was the orange one. What? You have vanilla in the trash. Orange isn't

899
02:42:50,250 --> 02:42:55,989
on here. Well, I'm just going to pretend that's what they are. No, in my... that's fine. This is

900
02:42:55,989 --> 02:43:01,670
vanilla Coke. This is orange Coke. It's in the trash. That's fine. We can use our own list.

901
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:12,840
Here, look. This is vanilla, and just pretend that this is orange Coke. It's caffeine free Coke.

902
02:43:13,850 --> 02:43:21,420
That's fine. I would put it in here anyways. Just, yeah, play pretend. All right. Hold on.

903
02:43:23,540 --> 02:43:32,149
I'm missing some stuff here. What is that? Oh, okay. Bottle of Coke versus Bottle of IVC Root

904
02:43:32,149 --> 02:43:36,309
Beer. Probably Bottle of Coke. Especially if it's like frosty. If there's like still like

905
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:45,260
white frosty shit all over it. And, ah, yeah. Only if it has the white frosty shit all over it.

906
02:43:45,260 --> 02:43:51,930
Otherwise, it's not as good. While I'm holding that in my hand, it has to burn me. It has to be

907
02:43:51,930 --> 02:44:05,989
like this is too fucking cold to even hold my hands. That's Mexican Coke. That's fine. Yeah,

908
02:44:05,989 --> 02:44:19,020
that's even actually even better. Pib Extra. I don't care. Oh, this is ginger beer, right?

909
02:44:19,739 --> 02:44:24,420
This stuff is actually pretty good. This is pretty good. I will put this up here.

910
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:44,260
That's good stuff. A&W gives me a stomach ache. Is this a bottle of Pepsi or is this a special

911
02:44:44,260 --> 02:44:50,500
Pepsi? I think that's just a glass bottle of Pepsi. I would... no, I'd rather have these two.

912
02:44:52,790 --> 02:45:07,139
Crystal Pepsi is a funny laugh out loud ecto cooler 90s kids thing. I don't care. This is...

913
02:45:08,579 --> 02:45:17,750
what is this? Oh, this is one of those... this is one of those Japanese sodas, right? This is the

914
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:25,989
thing where you like you punch the thing down and like bloop! Like the flavor goes in. It is, right?

915
02:45:27,780 --> 02:45:37,049
Okay. These are okay. These... I don't know if I... it's weird though. You don't really ever have an

916
02:45:37,049 --> 02:45:43,829
opportunity to drink these. Like why do you drink soda or liquid? Oh, I'm thirsty. I want to quench

917
02:45:43,829 --> 02:45:50,489
my thirst. This is more like a game than it is like drinking a soda. It's more like a, oh look

918
02:45:50,489 --> 02:45:55,129
at how cool that looks. Not like I can't wait to drink a Coke right now. It's like, yeah, it's fun.

919
02:46:02,219 --> 02:46:07,899
That's... but I would put Baja Blast in that same category. I don't like go... I don't drink Baja

920
02:46:07,899 --> 02:46:16,299
Blast, but if you go to Taco Bell, it's like, oh, the like teal green one. Yeah, I'll take that one.

921
02:46:16,299 --> 02:46:20,219
Oh yeah, this is fun. It's for fun. These are the ones for fun, and they belong up at sea.

922
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:33,430
There's no other scenario where I get this. Plus, I don't think you even get them. Can of Pepsi?

923
02:46:33,430 --> 02:46:38,090
Doesn't it... I mean, what's the... made with real sugar? This is a joke. This is... this is just like

924
02:46:38,090 --> 02:46:47,590
the look... look at how healthy we are when we're not healthy at all. Doesn't matter. Made with real

925
02:46:47,590 --> 02:47:00,620
sugar this time. It's still... it's still a Pepsi. You know, it probably is better than the regular

926
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:13,319
one. Okay, what is this one? Is this Diet? That looks like Diet to me, and it's making me angry,

927
02:47:13,319 --> 02:47:34,309
so it's going down here. Now, the rest of these... I've had Jones Soda before, but I'm not... I don't

928
02:47:34,309 --> 02:47:39,190
think I've had these enough to really have an opinion on it. Some of these. This one... this is

929
02:47:39,190 --> 02:47:43,350
pretty good. This is the orange one, right? There's like a lemon lime. Yeah, these are okay. These are

930
02:47:43,350 --> 02:47:47,270
good. These aren't bad. I'm just trying to remember how much better they are than the other ones.

931
02:47:50,899 --> 02:47:58,299
I distinctly remember these being very good. Like, potentially like best, but I don't... I haven't had

932
02:47:58,299 --> 02:48:04,389
them enough times to be able to have... that's not in my memory. I know they're good, but I know

933
02:48:04,389 --> 02:48:13,270
exactly what a 7-Up tastes like. I can... I can describe it to you. It's the only one that's going

934
02:48:13,270 --> 02:48:23,670
up there. 7-Up is the best soda in the world. It is. This is the... really the only ginger ale on the

935
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:35,399
list. Canada Dry is up there too. Those of you that disagree with this, that's okay. That's all

936
02:48:35,399 --> 02:48:40,840
right, but just... you got to listen. The next time that you go on an airplane, please, if they have

937
02:48:40,840 --> 02:48:53,059
it, get a 7-Up with that airplane ice. It enhances the flavor by 45%. Airplane ice and 7-Up... something

938
02:48:53,059 --> 02:48:57,940
about it. I don't know what it is. It's fucking really good. Because I don't know what's on that

939
02:48:57,940 --> 02:49:01,219
ice. I don't know if this is like... if that's... it might be toilet water. It could be toilet water ice,

940
02:49:01,219 --> 02:49:06,739
but there's some combination of like airplane toilet water ice and 7-Up that make it magical.

941
02:49:09,579 --> 02:49:14,379
It is by far the best soda I would drink it if... and then it's not everywhere either. That's the

942
02:49:14,379 --> 02:49:26,180
thing. See, all these dickheads... these guys are everywhere. 7-Up is not in every single store.

943
02:49:26,180 --> 02:49:31,290
You can get a Pepsi literally anywhere. You could get a Pepsi at the doctor's office if you really

944
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:38,139
want it to. A 7-Up is a treat. You see it in the cooler and you go, oh fuck, they got 7-Up here.

945
02:49:39,159 --> 02:49:42,360
Give me... give me like seven of them. And you like stuff it in your fucking arm and go to the

946
02:49:42,360 --> 02:49:52,760
checkout. We buy it at the grocery store. That's not fun. I can get 7-Up at my dentist office.

947
02:49:53,399 --> 02:49:59,190
There's a reason why 7-Up is hard to find. It's because it's just selling out. People are just

948
02:49:59,190 --> 02:50:04,360
buying so many of them. Because it's the best airplane soda. You know how many people fly on

949
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:08,680
airplanes every day? How many... okay, somebody calculate how many people are flying on an airplane

950
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:14,500
today? And how many of those people are drinking a 7-Up right now? It's got to be a lot. There are

951
02:50:14,500 --> 02:50:19,540
like 5,000 airplanes that are flying around right now. That's at least... how many passengers are on

952
02:50:19,540 --> 02:50:25,299
an airplane? Like a typical... like an Airbus or a 747 or whatever. There's probably like three... two

953
02:50:25,299 --> 02:50:30,780
or three hundred people on a plane? Something like that. 100 people? 200? So 200 times 5,000.

954
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:34,780
That's five, 10, 20, 25... that's like... let's just say there's like 200... let's just say there's like

955
02:50:34,780 --> 02:50:38,940
400,000 people flying around the plane right now. And like 40% of that... you got like 20... there's

956
02:50:38,940 --> 02:50:51,340
like probably 190,000 people drinking a 7-Up right now on an airplane. Definitely. More than that.

957
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:58,739
Where do they get those numbers? I don't know. This is like... I'm just... I'm just spitballing.

958
02:51:00,069 --> 02:51:07,700
This is an open spitball platform here. I don't... I don't got a... I don't got a guy over there

959
02:51:08,709 --> 02:51:12,309
with like four laptops and like two fucking Google searches open.

960
02:51:13,450 --> 02:51:19,239
Hey, what... how many people are on a plane today? No, it's just me. It's just me and you. And all

961
02:51:19,239 --> 02:51:35,110
these gross teeth rotting beverages. There's nobody else. Just the two of us. Times a couple...

962
02:51:35,110 --> 02:51:40,889
a hundred or a thousand people. Water is the S tier? Yeah, but it's not listed on here.

963
02:51:41,530 --> 02:51:45,129
All right, let's go back. This is our... these... I remember... these are really, really good, but I

964
02:51:45,129 --> 02:51:49,690
can't put them above anything else. I don't think I've ever had these. I've never had sausage soda

965
02:51:49,690 --> 02:52:01,110
before, I don't think. All right. Nope. Wait. Make sure I look good. Okay. 7-Up I think is the best

966
02:52:01,110 --> 02:53:01,850
on this list. Canada Dry and NW both A tier. Might have to move... not as good. Close. Too...

967
02:53:01,850 --> 02:53:06,729
too sugary, I think, to me. I just... I just tried it. I just tried it in my internal mind, and I

968
02:53:06,729 --> 02:53:25,930
think it was too sugary. These are all very sugary. Very, very sweet. Um, I think this is good. I don't

969
02:53:25,930 --> 02:53:31,420
think I need to change anything. Although, let me put all the diet ones at the very bottom.

970
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:36,659
Because this is diet, right? It's like diet cherry vanilla Dr. Pepper, right?

971
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:49,750
Yeah, definitely. Like, diet Pepsi is probably the worst drink. Cherry Pepsi is in the trash?

972
02:53:55,899 --> 02:54:17,180
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I have had this before. I've had this before. No, I'm not. I don't like the cherry...

973
02:54:18,520 --> 02:54:21,639
like, cherry Coke is all right, but no, it's not up there very high.

974
02:54:22,520 --> 02:54:29,450
Cherry Coke is okay. I don't remember this being something that I really liked.

975
02:54:38,729 --> 02:55:06,600
Done. They're just... done. I'm happy with it. Meats. Why is there meats? There's a Taco Bell menu

976
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:10,280
one. I don't even need to do it. There's only one item that belongs up anywhere. You already know

977
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:29,129
what it is. You want to do meats? All right, I'll do meats. I'm not doing Jell-O. They're all gross.

978
02:55:29,850 --> 02:55:42,040
Oh, there's chips. This one's all right, too. I'll do that after. What the fuck is this?

979
02:55:42,120 --> 02:55:50,010
G Fuel Tier List? Where does Kool-Aid Packets and Pixie Sticks fall on that list?

980
02:55:56,870 --> 02:56:05,719
All right, well, it's a meat one. I'll take the meat one. Cheez-Its.

981
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:28,180
There we go. Meat. Let's try meat. Did I fuck it up? Meats. Okay, this is perfect. This is fine.

982
02:56:28,180 --> 02:56:33,639
I've had all of these, I think, although I can't really determine what some of them are.

983
02:56:36,260 --> 02:56:47,030
Uh, bacon is the first one here, and bacon is good, but it's also a meme food.

984
02:56:48,700 --> 02:56:52,219
Bacon is one of those things that, for some reason, the internet got ahold of it

985
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:57,180
and became, like, the coolest fucking thing in the world. Putting bacon on something

986
02:56:58,379 --> 02:57:06,649
made it cool, even if it wasn't cool at all. Bacon. Oh, whoa! You put bacon on that sandwich.

987
02:57:07,129 --> 02:57:18,979
Yeah, it's become a big thing. Like, bacon. Okay, let me tell you something. Bacon and the word,

988
02:57:19,860 --> 02:57:26,950
like, epic, are the same word, right? If you put bacon on something, it makes it epic.

989
02:57:26,950 --> 02:57:35,819
That's just what happens. Nothing wrong with that. There's no problem with it. It's just,

990
02:57:35,819 --> 02:57:44,840
that's what, that's just the kind of what happened. I don't find it to be like this god meat

991
02:57:45,719 --> 02:57:51,059
that people started putting on their ice cream. I don't, I don't think so. I think it's good.

992
02:57:51,059 --> 02:57:56,620
I like bacon a lot. I eat it all the time, but it's not like, I put bacon on this, therefore,

993
02:57:56,620 --> 02:58:07,420
now it's the best. It's awesome. No, it's just bacon. I just eat it. Bacon is a condiment to me.

994
02:58:08,739 --> 02:58:14,899
It's not really, it's a side. It's a condiment. It's like putting mustard on your hamburger.

995
02:58:17,270 --> 02:58:27,420
You don't, like, oh, hey, guys. Hey, so today, come on in for dinner. I made a bacon. What? No,

996
02:58:27,420 --> 02:58:44,760
it's, it goes on stuff. It's a side. Yeah, but it's, I'm being a hipster. Wouldn't I be being

997
02:58:44,760 --> 02:58:57,379
a hipster if I said that bacon is fucking so awesome, epic, cool? That's mainstream.

998
02:58:59,479 --> 02:59:27,030
Well, you're really going to not like this. Am I still a hipster? Is this salmon? Done. Done.

999
02:59:27,030 --> 02:59:35,260
Sausage? Wait, chicken? What's this? Fried chicken? What's the difference? Isn't this

1000
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:40,620
chicken? Is that turkey? Wait, is that a turkey? That's a turkey. No, no, no, no. That doesn't go

1001
02:59:40,620 --> 02:59:55,219
up there. This is pork. This is like a hamburger patty. Hold on. Oh, I'm going to make people angry

1002
02:59:55,219 --> 03:00:06,840
with this. I know I am. It's a ham. I don't like ham. Not really. I think it's, yeah, it's a, I'm

1003
03:00:06,840 --> 03:00:19,159
not a big fan. Also, not a big fan of steak. I do like ribs. I would rather eat a steak than ham,

1004
03:00:19,159 --> 03:00:31,059
though. These ribs. Hold on. I just need to get it on the plate first. I, everybody, hold on. I need

1005
03:00:31,059 --> 03:00:39,930
to just get it on the plate. What is that? Is that like white fish, like cod or haddock or something?

1006
03:00:39,930 --> 03:00:53,500
What is it? I would put that up here. So I'll put sausage here. No. Okay. Is this, what is that?

1007
03:00:54,139 --> 03:01:07,379
Is that lamb? What is this? Brisket? That's, is that brisket? Doesn't look like brisket.

1008
03:01:07,379 --> 03:01:28,379
Is it brisket? That's turkey. No, that's turkey. Maybe it's duck. That, is that duck? That's chicken.

1009
03:01:28,379 --> 03:01:34,440
So what's that? Why is it like different? Is it like fried chicken and regular chicken?

1010
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:45,799
It's, yeah, it's unclear. I'll take, I'll take a salmon and a 7-up, please. Pork chops? So then

1011
03:01:45,799 --> 03:02:01,739
what is this, though? I don't know what that is. I think this is duck. I'm going to say that's duck.

1012
03:02:01,739 --> 03:02:19,860
Okay, now hold on. Would I rather eat ham or duck? No. I don't like duck. That's too gamey. I don't

1013
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:30,299
like it. Would I rather eat like pork cutlets or cutlets over steak? I would eat cutlets. Sausage

1014
03:02:30,299 --> 03:02:39,270
over, yeah, I like, I like sausage. Hamburger over, this is, is this, what is this? Is this chicken

1015
03:02:39,270 --> 03:02:42,389
cutlet? This is pork cutlet right here. So that's chicken cutlet. Is this chicken cutlet? Is this

1016
03:02:42,389 --> 03:02:49,430
pork cutlet? I'm going to say this is pork cutlet and this is chicken cutlet just from my brain,

1017
03:02:49,430 --> 03:02:57,930
and they could be wrong. I'm pretty sure that pork is this one. I would rather eat a hamburger

1018
03:03:00,250 --> 03:03:07,129
than pork. Yes, I probably would. Bacon, it's just a fucking condiment. I'm putting it on the list.

1019
03:03:07,129 --> 03:03:15,450
I'm just going to be condiments. How can you put like bacon over a hamburger? It's, that's not,

1020
03:03:16,010 --> 03:03:24,969
this is mustard. Would I rather eat, I'd rather eat chicken,

1021
03:03:25,690 --> 03:03:36,329
turkey, salmon. I think this is good. Tofu, I find to be just something I never want to have.

1022
03:03:38,700 --> 03:03:48,659
It's weird. It's, I just don't, I don't like it. I really don't. I actually really don't like soy,

1023
03:03:48,659 --> 03:03:57,719
like anything, really at all. I don't like soy milk. I don't like soy, like tofu. I don't like,

1024
03:04:01,100 --> 03:04:08,950
it's just that I don't like it. It doesn't do it for me. But I do, I do also not like steak.

1025
03:04:10,649 --> 03:04:14,729
I wouldn't order steak at a restaurant. If I had an opportunity, it would be something up here.

1026
03:04:14,729 --> 03:04:28,889
It wouldn't be a steak. No, I'd rather eat steak than ham. But I'm a, I'm a, I'm a fly and fish

1027
03:04:28,889 --> 03:04:33,209
kind of person. Salmon is probably my favorite meat. Or, you know, turkey probably would be my

1028
03:04:33,209 --> 03:04:38,010
favorite if it was easy to get all the time and easy to make. Salmon is really easy to make.

1029
03:04:38,010 --> 03:04:42,760
Turkey's not easy to make. If you want to make like a fucking Thanksgiving turkey, it takes like

1030
03:04:43,399 --> 03:04:59,829
a day to make it. You can make this in five minutes. Would I rather have like a piece of

1031
03:04:59,829 --> 03:05:07,350
cod or a hamburger? Hamburger. It's still up here though, but does it, but yeah, no,

1032
03:05:07,909 --> 03:05:24,090
yep, no. Learn to cook turkey. You forgot forehead. Salmon, turkey, chicken, hamburger meat,

1033
03:05:25,110 --> 03:05:35,860
whitefish, chicken cutlets, bacon, bacon, ribs, sausage, pork cutlets, and then steak, ham,

1034
03:05:36,420 --> 03:05:48,329
duck, and tofu. Bring it on. What's next? Why are ribs and steak so low? I'm not a big red meat fan.

1035
03:05:48,329 --> 03:05:56,180
I like burgers and I like meatballs. And that's kind of it. Game of Thrones characters? No,

1036
03:05:56,180 --> 03:06:21,340
that's like spoilers. Not seeing one I want to do yet. Best pop tarts? It's s'mores pop tarts.

1037
03:06:22,700 --> 03:06:41,670
Discussion over. Chips. Chips is a good one. I'll do chips. Is this the full list here? This doesn't

1038
03:06:41,670 --> 03:06:51,670
look like a full list to me. Is this a full list? This is not. This is not enough on here.

1039
03:06:55,979 --> 03:07:11,799
Ultra tier? No. Epic American chips. That's not, you just made that. You just made that.

1040
03:07:11,799 --> 03:07:21,639
Is bacon on there? Epic American chips. Yeah, this is, this is a, I want a bigger list.

1041
03:07:27,690 --> 03:07:33,219
Why do I feel like this is a smaller list? Like you gave, you gave me a bunch of like

1042
03:07:33,219 --> 03:07:49,690
Smash Brothers clones. Is this, is this, this is not in a variety here. It's just all Cheetos,

1043
03:07:49,690 --> 03:08:01,350
Doritos and Lay's. Where are the Pringles? Okay. Where are the Munchos? I don't see them on this

1044
03:08:01,350 --> 03:08:21,129
list. Chip tiers. I got another one. Hold on. All right. Hold on. This is a little bit more.

1045
03:08:22,010 --> 03:08:29,100
They're on this list. All right. I think this is the one. Combos are on here too. All right.

1046
03:08:29,100 --> 03:08:38,149
This is better. This is better. Yeah, this is better. All right. Right. We got baked Lay's on

1047
03:08:38,149 --> 03:08:58,780
here. Baked Lay's not on here. Yeah, no baked Lay's, no Cape Cod. What's this one? Do snacks? Wait,

1048
03:08:58,780 --> 03:09:11,059
you can add? Can I add stuff? Cape Cod are Zoomer chips. Cape Cod has been a chip

1049
03:09:11,059 --> 03:09:42,889
brand since I was like fucking four years old. Zoomer chips. Is this one better? All right. Okay.

1050
03:09:46,569 --> 03:09:54,440
Cape Cod is a Redditor chip. Oh, this is the list we're doing because I already know which one is

1051
03:09:54,440 --> 03:10:11,270
this. Oh yeah. Yeah. Holy shit. Those things are amazing. You never had those before. Don't let the,

1052
03:10:11,270 --> 03:10:17,190
don't let the title fool you. These are fucking amazing. They're so good. With baked Lay's,

1053
03:10:17,190 --> 03:10:23,049
it's going to be a fight up here. It's going to be a, it's going to be a brawl up in this,

1054
03:10:23,049 --> 03:10:26,329
in the S-rank. I can't have more than one or two, but it's going to be a fight up there.

1055
03:10:28,250 --> 03:10:40,360
Goldfish is definitely A or B tier. Where are those munchos? No munchos on this list, huh?

1056
03:10:50,139 --> 03:11:02,340
Fuck. No. This is going to be a fight up here. I, hold on. It's actually going to be easier to

1057
03:11:02,340 --> 03:11:31,850
go bottom up with this. These taste like dog food. All Lay's brand that are not baked Lay's go down

1058
03:11:31,850 --> 03:11:41,719
in D because they're fine. They're fine. But once you eat two thirds of the bag, you're just left

1059
03:11:41,719 --> 03:11:52,090
with a greasy fucking bread crumbs. The bag is full and it's this fucking big. The bag is huge.

1060
03:11:54,100 --> 03:11:58,979
Down here are the chips. Here's the layer of ones that have not been sat on by like a fat

1061
03:11:58,979 --> 03:12:07,829
guy on a plane. Making lots of plane references today. Under there is just bread crumbs. I'm sorry.

1062
03:12:09,430 --> 03:12:15,190
I do like, but look, I'm not a Lay's hater. I got baked Lay's up in the best chips that I've ever

1063
03:12:15,190 --> 03:12:23,590
had. It's the classic ones. It's the classic, just greasy ones. Any more of those? Cause they're going

1064
03:12:23,590 --> 03:12:35,139
right there. Bugles, F. No, I don't like them. Bugles tastes like cereal without any like sugar

1065
03:12:35,780 --> 03:12:41,420
on them. They just taste like, like just did nothing. It just has, it tastes like air.

1066
03:12:41,420 --> 03:13:01,000
It's just eating dry air. I eat dry air every day here anyways in Vegas. I also really, really do

1067
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:11,079
not like the Ruffles brand, like the Ruffles. No, I don't like these either. Tostitos. This is an

1068
03:13:11,079 --> 03:13:15,799
interesting thing here because Tostitos are nothing without salsa or queso. So I don't know if they

1069
03:13:15,799 --> 03:13:22,020
belong on this list. Are these just standard default, just eat tortilla chips out of the bag

1070
03:13:22,020 --> 03:13:32,149
or am I implying that I'm eating these with salsa or queso? Are we implying that I'm enjoying them

1071
03:13:32,149 --> 03:13:43,479
with salsa? Just the chip, just alone without the chip, without it. Well then, I mean, I would never

1072
03:13:43,479 --> 03:13:52,489
do that. I would never eat Tostitos unless I was dipping it in some type of viscous fluid that had

1073
03:13:52,489 --> 03:13:56,649
like a spicy or cheesy flavor to it. No, I would not do that. I'm not going to do that. Why would

1074
03:13:56,649 --> 03:14:07,579
I do that? I'm just not going to do that, regardless of how they taste. I'm sorry. These are the ones

1075
03:14:07,579 --> 03:14:12,059
that taste, which are the, we're the dog food ones. Yeah, no, these are all the Frito heavily

1076
03:14:12,059 --> 03:14:17,340
flavored. That's a heavy spice, heavy flavoring. They're just cat food, dog food. I can't eat them.

1077
03:14:20,870 --> 03:14:26,120
Regular Fritos though, those are, those are good. Hey, can you focus here? Come on, what's going on?

1078
03:14:26,120 --> 03:14:45,719
Camera. Focus. We're just the default Doritos. There they are. This is going to take some

1079
03:14:45,719 --> 03:14:53,139
revisions. Doritos Jacked. I don't, I wouldn't, I don't want these. I would never buy them.

1080
03:14:54,889 --> 03:15:01,899
This is like Doritos Chili Lime. I would never buy them. I like Cool Ranch less than I like

1081
03:15:03,319 --> 03:15:11,059
the regular Doritos. I just wouldn't buy, I don't, I'm not going to eat, I'm not going to eat these.

1082
03:15:12,520 --> 03:15:18,760
I am actually a sucker for these. I love the compilations. Pretzel Cheese Squares.

1083
03:15:20,440 --> 03:15:27,850
Like Sun Chip, I love because you get a little bit of everything. So I like having that. Although

1084
03:15:28,569 --> 03:15:36,649
I would never buy these. In fact, this is at the very bottom. All Sun Chips are at the very bottom.

1085
03:15:42,219 --> 03:15:53,020
Yeah, they are. No, I dare, once you eat one of these, if I had one, then I would be done.

1086
03:15:54,229 --> 03:16:00,340
Eating more than three, four, five, or six Sun Chips, they just start, it doesn't, it just starts

1087
03:16:00,340 --> 03:16:08,819
to taste strange. If it's my first chip, this is up here, but it's eating like at least, I'm going

1088
03:16:08,819 --> 03:16:16,180
to say like a half, like a couple dozen. I wouldn't sit down and eat a whole bag of these. I would eat

1089
03:16:16,180 --> 03:16:20,969
a whole bag. In fact, I've done it before many times. I have gotten the normal regular size

1090
03:16:20,969 --> 03:16:26,229
Bake Lays and I'm talking within the last couple of weeks. Now I'm like, oh, I've done that before.

1091
03:16:26,229 --> 03:16:29,989
Like, no, I did this like two weeks ago. I ate the whole bag. I do it all the time.

1092
03:16:31,540 --> 03:16:39,500
I wouldn't do that with these. Um, which, what are these? Which one of these?

1093
03:16:40,870 --> 03:16:51,780
Moldy Doritos. I don't, I don't, I wouldn't get them. I don't know. It's like something all over.

1094
03:16:53,260 --> 03:17:02,229
Cheetos. Um, I would put Cheetos up in it. The regular, like the asymmetrical Cheetos.

1095
03:17:02,229 --> 03:17:09,180
I like more than the puff ones. So yeah. Flamin' Hot. I'm not a fan. I'd rather just give me the

1096
03:17:09,180 --> 03:17:19,350
regular ones. Flamin' Hot. Not only does Flamin' Hot taste worse to me, but it increases the amount

1097
03:17:19,350 --> 03:17:26,149
of shit on your hands by at least twice, two or three times. I will eat Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

1098
03:17:27,319 --> 03:17:33,879
You fucking have to wash your hands. It's awful. And I don't know why that's considered a good

1099
03:17:33,879 --> 03:17:38,860
thing. Oh dude, like I got so much Cheeto, like the Flamin' Hot dust on my hands. Why don't they

1100
03:17:38,860 --> 03:17:43,700
make it so it's not, they're not like that. Nobody wants to do that. Where can you eat those? Where

1101
03:17:43,700 --> 03:17:54,059
can you reliably eat Flamin' Hot Cheetos? You have to be like in your bathroom. It's part of the

1102
03:17:54,059 --> 03:18:02,969
trademark. Dirty hands. But it's something with Flamin' Hot. The regular Cheetos don't really,

1103
03:18:02,969 --> 03:18:09,020
they do that a little bit. But you may as well have like fucking murdered somebody after you eat

1104
03:18:09,020 --> 03:18:17,049
Flamin' Hot Cheetos. You're like a blood all over you. And no, I'm not going to lick the, like,

1105
03:18:17,450 --> 03:18:20,889
you know what the fucking hands have been on a daily basis? You want to talk about like, like

1106
03:18:20,889 --> 03:18:26,409
getting sick and how we need to be more health conscious? Yeah. Put your hands as far down in

1107
03:18:26,409 --> 03:18:34,860
your mouth as you can over and over again. That's a great idea. No, that's like so like bizarre.

1108
03:18:35,500 --> 03:18:42,260
You got to like, yeah, you got to wash your hands. But what if you're not in your bathroom? What if

1109
03:18:42,260 --> 03:18:47,940
you're walking down the street with a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos? Okay, you've eaten like 20

1110
03:18:48,579 --> 03:18:54,340
of them now. What do you do? What do you do? You're walking around, where are you? What do you do?

1111
03:18:57,159 --> 03:19:08,459
You, yeah. And then you go like this. That's better. Or like, yeah, that's better. That's

1112
03:19:08,459 --> 03:19:23,079
sanitary. Just pour the bag in your mouth. Eat them with chopsticks. These do that, but these do that

1113
03:19:23,079 --> 03:19:32,040
way more. Therefore, they're at the bottom of the list. Chex Mix, mid-tier. I like this style more

1114
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:38,229
than I like Chex Mix. I don't really like Chex. Combos are really good, but combos are actually

1115
03:19:38,229 --> 03:19:46,620
also like really bad too. You can only get these at like gas stations. So there's something going

1116
03:19:46,620 --> 03:20:03,930
on there. Goldfish Flavor Blasted is just the same complaint that I have about, ow, my hand.

1117
03:20:03,930 --> 03:20:10,360
That hurts so fucking much. That hurt a lot. And I'm gonna complain about it. Flavor Blasted

1118
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:14,840
Goldfish are the same thing as Flamin' Hot Cheetos. They just put extra dust on it and

1119
03:20:16,680 --> 03:20:21,989
it's just give me the regular ones. Those ones are better. Funyuns are okay in small doses.

1120
03:20:21,989 --> 03:20:28,870
They're pretty good, although I wouldn't, I don't think I'd put them at B. Cheez-Its are definitely

1121
03:20:28,870 --> 03:20:35,940
a little, they're up here. Now this is, is this Tabasco? Spicy? Because if those are the ones

1122
03:20:35,940 --> 03:20:40,100
they belong up here. I'm not a big fan of any of the other early Cheez-It Brains. I like the hot

1123
03:20:40,100 --> 03:20:45,700
ones. I like the super toasty ones and I like the regular ones. Cheetos Puffs, again, like I said,

1124
03:20:45,700 --> 03:20:52,579
I would rather have these, the regular ones, the asymmetrical crunchy ones over the puffy cloudy

1125
03:20:52,579 --> 03:21:06,459
ones. Oh, those are White Cheddar. Yeah, that may, this may have been a mistake. They belong up here.

1126
03:21:06,459 --> 03:21:18,299
The White Cheddar ones are actually insane. Again, this is like Flamin' Hot Cheeto. Just,

1127
03:21:18,299 --> 03:21:23,979
oh yeah. Do we have a chip? Yes, we do. Do we also have an evil version of those chips?

1128
03:21:23,979 --> 03:21:37,100
We better. Chesters? One of these? I don't know what these are. No, they're the fries, the little

1129
03:21:37,100 --> 03:21:47,450
like, like little hot fries. Where are the hot fries? Why are they not in here? Okay, can I pretend

1130
03:21:48,489 --> 03:21:59,030
that these are the actual hot fries? But can I also pretend that they are the regular cheesy ones,

1131
03:21:59,030 --> 03:22:03,559
not the hot ones? Because that's not on this list. I'm not going to put these up anywhere high.

1132
03:22:03,559 --> 03:22:12,629
I'm pretending that these are the original fries. I don't need to pretend. Are they on here? No,

1133
03:22:12,629 --> 03:22:19,579
not on here. Okay, so that this is, this is hot. These are the regular mild hot fries.

1134
03:22:21,379 --> 03:22:26,540
These go up here. Yeah, they have, they have regular ones. Oh yeah. They're insane. They're

1135
03:22:26,540 --> 03:22:40,950
amazing. They're everything you love about the hot ones, except they're not hot. Just add them. Yeah,

1136
03:22:40,950 --> 03:22:59,270
yeah, the Andy Caps. Andy Caps is the one I'm talking about. I don't know what these are. What's

1137
03:22:59,270 --> 03:23:10,299
going on in here? Taco flavored Doritos? I don't, I don't, I don't think I would want to get those.

1138
03:23:14,059 --> 03:23:23,290
Gordettas. This looks like a little combo mix thing. I think I've had it a few times,

1139
03:23:23,290 --> 03:23:26,649
but I don't really remember. It kind of, it's the same thing as Chex next to me, my brain.

1140
03:23:28,620 --> 03:23:49,459
Salt, salt and vinegar chips are really bad. Just tastes like rotten potato chips.

1141
03:23:50,020 --> 03:24:06,170
It tastes like potato chips that the bag was open. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It just, they're,

1142
03:24:06,170 --> 03:24:12,459
they're just, they're just pee. It's just urine chips. That's just what I think of. I'm sorry.

1143
03:24:12,459 --> 03:24:16,540
It just, it's just urine potato chips. That's, that's it. And that's all I have to say.

1144
03:24:17,340 --> 03:24:24,309
I really, really dialed up the polarization here in chat, and I didn't mean to, but I just,

1145
03:24:24,309 --> 03:24:44,659
I'm being honest. I'm just being honest. I am fucking fuming. I personally disagree,

1146
03:24:44,659 --> 03:24:53,930
but I understand and respect your opinion. All right, we've got Pringles here. There's no normal

1147
03:24:53,930 --> 03:24:59,049
Pringles somehow. There's just sour cream and onion Pringles and pizza Pringles, which I don't

1148
03:24:59,049 --> 03:25:03,750
really like either one of them. In fact, regular Pringles, I think, are not even the best ones.

1149
03:25:04,709 --> 03:25:25,500
I think cheddar Pringles. I think are my favorite. Honey mustard Pringles. I've never had them.

1150
03:25:25,500 --> 03:25:33,879
Those sound good. They sound pretty good. Honey mustard Pringles. I would rather eat any Pringles

1151
03:25:33,879 --> 03:25:41,819
over any Lay's though. That's for sure. Kettle cooked Lay's. I mean, we already have the,

1152
03:25:41,819 --> 03:25:49,079
I mean, these, I wouldn't even, I don't want these. These are essentially the same idea,

1153
03:25:49,079 --> 03:25:52,280
except these ones have barbecue sauce on them. These ones are just better.

1154
03:25:54,979 --> 03:26:01,420
Um, pork skins. I've never had these before. I actually need to put like another, hold on,

1155
03:26:01,420 --> 03:26:07,739
let me do another row of, I've never had this before because this is at least, at least

1156
03:26:07,739 --> 03:26:19,959
six of these that I have actually really never eaten. Never had. I've never had these Doritos.

1157
03:26:20,840 --> 03:26:32,549
I've never had whatever these are. I don't, I've never had them. I don't know if I've ever had

1158
03:26:32,549 --> 03:26:41,159
these. I have this weird memory of me eating them, but I don't think so. Uh, the rest of these,

1159
03:26:41,159 --> 03:26:46,920
I've never had these pork skins. I've never had like these hot and spicy. I've seen these before

1160
03:26:47,559 --> 03:26:53,049
because they always say that they're two dollars. It's printed on the bag everywhere,

1161
03:26:53,049 --> 03:27:08,680
but I never had them. I've never had these. I've never had these and these are bad. It's just,

1162
03:27:08,680 --> 03:27:13,559
it's like, it's just, it's maybe, you eat saltines. It's just a saltine 2.0.

1163
03:27:16,040 --> 03:27:23,850
I don't know. What are these? Potato sticks? I don't think I've ever had those.

1164
03:27:24,409 --> 03:27:34,229
So let's start from the bottom. Which one of these that I really don't like what I've,

1165
03:27:34,229 --> 03:27:49,299
what I want to eat the most? Probably these. No, I don't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't choose those over

1166
03:27:49,299 --> 03:27:53,940
any of these. Probably, probably Bugles because it's, oh look, it's weird and I haven't had these

1167
03:27:53,940 --> 03:27:58,180
in 10 years and oh wow, I can't believe they have these here. That would be the only reason.

1168
03:27:58,899 --> 03:28:11,219
These are the Doritos flavors. I would probably try them. Like I've had them a couple times.

1169
03:28:11,219 --> 03:28:15,459
It would be like, ah, I guess, okay, if there was like, if there was a Doritos shortage

1170
03:28:15,459 --> 03:28:21,479
and I really wanted Doritos and I had to get them, I had to eat them, it would be those.

1171
03:28:22,200 --> 03:28:30,969
I don't want this, the hot Mr. Munchies. The Tostitos would be all the way, all the way at

1172
03:28:30,969 --> 03:28:36,520
the bottom. Triscuits Tostitos would be at the very bottom because it just, you need all those,

1173
03:28:37,159 --> 03:28:43,700
you can't enjoy triscuits without like a piece of cheese or a piece of pepperoni on it. We,

1174
03:28:43,700 --> 03:28:49,000
this is implied and this is, I asked you guys this. Eating Tostitos without salsa is just,

1175
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:53,959
I don't, it's just a cracker. Eating triscuits without like a pepperoni on it or like a little,

1176
03:28:54,520 --> 03:28:58,760
like a spread or some, or like a dip is, I wouldn't want to do, I wouldn't do that.

1177
03:28:59,479 --> 03:29:09,930
I wouldn't, I'm sorry, I just wouldn't do it. Crackers are good, but if I'm at the grocery

1178
03:29:09,930 --> 03:29:16,440
store I'm not going to go. Triscuits, get them in the cart. I can't wait to eat a handful of those,

1179
03:29:17,159 --> 03:29:30,340
like 20 of them today, right now. I'm, no. Do I know how pepperoni is made?

1180
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:43,610
I don't know, some guy, some, some guy in a pizza restaurant, like sings and then they,

1181
03:29:43,610 --> 03:29:53,989
they just appear on the plate I guess. I don't know. Lime Tostitos are the worst.

1182
03:29:54,709 --> 03:30:07,909
Um, are these, these, these are original. When I put chips in the sandwich, I used to do that

1183
03:30:07,909 --> 03:30:16,200
until I got hurt. I used to put potato chips in my tuna sandwich until one day I took a bite

1184
03:30:16,200 --> 03:30:20,600
and it literally like pierced up into my mouth and I said that I'm never going to do that again.

1185
03:30:21,479 --> 03:30:27,540
It hurt me. I got hurt. Okay, so that's, this is done. I would not want to eat these.

1186
03:30:28,500 --> 03:30:33,290
I really don't like salt and vinegar. I really don't. Okay, the D. These are ones that I would

1187
03:30:33,290 --> 03:30:44,090
eat, but I wouldn't choose, right? I would eat these, but I wouldn't choose these. That's where

1188
03:30:44,090 --> 03:30:59,219
I put D. Fuck, I wouldn't choose any of these. These are all on the same level, so do not be

1189
03:30:59,219 --> 03:31:05,059
fooled by this list going kind of descending down this way. No, they're all the same. I wouldn't get

1190
03:31:05,059 --> 03:31:09,219
any of these. I would eat them, but I wouldn't. No, they're all in the same tier for me. All of

1191
03:31:09,219 --> 03:31:17,100
them. Okay, moving on. Now, this is things that I would pick on a rainy day. If it was rainy outside

1192
03:31:17,100 --> 03:31:21,260
and I was like, it's fucking raining out. I want to get a snack or something. This is one of those.

1193
03:31:21,260 --> 03:31:30,420
This is like it's sunny out. This is like a rainy shitty day. I think Bake Lays just goes in the

1194
03:31:30,420 --> 03:31:49,700
front just because I would eat Bake Lays no matter what. I would eat combos way before I would eat

1195
03:31:50,659 --> 03:32:11,139
Chex mixes, I think. Yeah, that's good. Yep. I like, I love nachos, Doritos. I don't love Fritos,

1196
03:32:11,139 --> 03:32:19,959
though. This is like a wow, I really like these. I don't really, I don't really like Fritos. This is

1197
03:32:19,959 --> 03:32:38,010
a problem. Yeah, this is a problem. I would, yeah, I would choose Cool Ranch over Barbecue Bake Lays,

1198
03:32:38,010 --> 03:32:52,059
I think. I would eat Fritos over, no, I wouldn't. That's accurate. Yeah, I would definitely choose

1199
03:32:52,059 --> 03:33:04,469
Fritos over Chex Mix. This is, I don't think I need to change anything here. This is where it's

1200
03:33:04,469 --> 03:33:10,940
going to get hard. All right, this is the difficult part, trying to decide which actually is my

1201
03:33:10,940 --> 03:33:21,690
favorite, like snack. These two are up here. Goldfish come down a little. In fact, I would

1202
03:33:21,690 --> 03:33:32,309
choose, I would choose nacho Doritos over Goldfish. Very small margin, though. Would I choose Cheez-Its

1203
03:33:32,309 --> 03:33:54,170
over Doritos? These are scary. The reason why Goldfish are so scary is because I buy the bucket.

1204
03:33:54,889 --> 03:34:02,940
Do you know the giant, like fucking high school milk carton? I buy the big one, the one that's

1205
03:34:02,940 --> 03:34:09,750
supposed to feed like 40 people, and you just, you sit there and you're watching TV or a movie,

1206
03:34:10,629 --> 03:34:21,319
and you eat like 25 people's worth of servings in those, they're dangerous. Why do I have Cape

1207
03:34:21,319 --> 03:34:27,239
Cod so high if I don't like Kettle Chips? I love Kettle Chips. I just, I just don't like the, the

1208
03:34:27,239 --> 03:34:36,360
bar, I just really don't like barbecue, uh, Lay's Kettle Chips. I wouldn't like choose these. I don't,

1209
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:42,620
I don't like, I'm not a big like barbecue chip fan, if that's been clear, I guess. The only reason

1210
03:34:42,620 --> 03:34:53,159
why these are up here is because they're baked. You have garbage tastes. Why are Baked Lay's an S?

1211
03:34:53,159 --> 03:35:02,069
Because Baked Lay's have my favorite chip. And Smartfood is actually about to go up because I'm

1212
03:35:02,069 --> 03:35:05,270
trying to figure out how, what my top three are going to be, and then me just sitting here,

1213
03:35:05,270 --> 03:35:22,180
I figured it out. Why is your opinion different than mine? Smartfood is fucking delicious. It's

1214
03:35:22,180 --> 03:35:28,709
that, it's white cheddar popcorn. Remember when everybody freaked out when white cheddar Cheez-Its

1215
03:35:28,709 --> 03:35:40,579
were over here? What? What? Smartfood is white cheddar popcorn. It's insane. Come on. Smartfood,

1216
03:35:40,579 --> 03:35:50,229
there's got to be some people that agree here. It's fake popcorn. It's just, I don't know why

1217
03:35:50,229 --> 03:35:59,940
a company would make fake popcorn when popcorn is the world's cheapest thing to produce. Why would

1218
03:35:59,940 --> 03:36:14,379
you fake something? It would probably cost more money to fake than to make popcorn. What do you

1219
03:36:14,379 --> 03:36:21,940
think is in there? No, I think it's plastic. It would be like four dollars a bag. It's bones.

1220
03:36:22,809 --> 03:36:35,860
Popcorn. Popcorn. Pop popcorn. There? Are we happy? What would you put up on S? I'm just curious.

1221
03:36:35,860 --> 03:36:47,579
Sun Chips? The only place where Sun Chips belong are in a big bowl at a fucking retirees party.

1222
03:36:48,540 --> 03:36:54,299
And guess what? I really hate to say this to you, but that bowl is going to be just as full

1223
03:36:54,299 --> 03:37:05,459
six hours later when parties are. What else? What do you want? What do you want up there?

1224
03:37:06,100 --> 03:37:13,159
What do you want up there? Funyuns? I've got nothing on Funyuns. They're actually pretty good.

1225
03:37:26,440 --> 03:37:31,530
I told you this wasn't going to be easy. Don't even come talk shit about rolled golds.

1226
03:37:32,409 --> 03:37:36,569
I will delete the stream. I will turn the stream off and delete it. I will delete the VOD.

1227
03:37:37,370 --> 03:37:40,569
And then I'll re-upload the VOD on YouTube and edit that part out of you guys talking about it.

1228
03:37:42,489 --> 03:37:46,729
If you don't think rolled golds, pretzels belong up here, then I'm sorry. You and I have an

1229
03:37:46,729 --> 03:38:07,620
extreme disagreement. You like cheese. You just like cheese. Smart food. White cheddar.

1230
03:38:08,760 --> 03:38:13,780
That's not accurate. Cheetah. In fact, I'm seeing something right now that I don't like.

1231
03:38:19,370 --> 03:38:32,379
I would choose goldfish over Cheetos so that it doesn't belong down there. I actually would

1232
03:38:32,379 --> 03:38:42,659
probably rather eat like 30 people's worth of goldfish over cheeses. Oh, he's climbing.

1233
03:38:42,659 --> 03:38:46,739
He's climbing up there. What's the next Mortal Kombat contestant? What's up? Rolled gold?

1234
03:38:47,620 --> 03:38:52,739
Was it Shang Tsung? Oh, he's taking them on. He's done. I would rather eat goldfish than rolled

1235
03:38:52,739 --> 03:39:05,909
golds. What we got left? We got fuck. We got Goro and then we got Shao Kahn. I would rather eat the

1236
03:39:05,909 --> 03:40:01,540
hot fries though. It's not S tier. It's not. It's very close. I'm having second thoughts about

1237
03:40:01,540 --> 03:40:09,059
those like Andy Capps fries because if you look at the back of those fries, this is like fucking

1238
03:40:09,059 --> 03:40:16,200
500 ingredients. It's something crazy. The amount of shit that's on the back of that container

1239
03:40:16,920 --> 03:40:20,200
is like too much. It's like laundry detergent amount of shit that's in there,

1240
03:40:21,639 --> 03:40:36,760
but they're fucking good. Wow. You're so healthy. Were you present for the cereal segment an hour

1241
03:40:36,760 --> 03:40:53,350
ago? I was not. Check that out. There's plenty of cereals in there that people thought I was like

1242
03:40:53,350 --> 03:41:14,549
a fucking eight-year-old for liking. Done. Done. It's done. Wait. Done. Am I okay with that? I'm

1243
03:41:14,549 --> 03:41:39,079
okay with that. Done. Done. Done. Now it's done. Utz is not on the list. I know it's unfortunate.

1244
03:41:39,079 --> 03:41:45,180
Munchos aren't on this list either. Munchos would have been up here. See, the reason why SmartFood

1245
03:41:45,180 --> 03:41:51,260
is here is because Munchos are not on the list. I am replacing Munchos with SmartFood. SmartFood

1246
03:41:51,260 --> 03:42:01,659
would be down here, but it has to be up here because I have memories. Baked Lays I get every

1247
03:42:01,659 --> 03:42:07,110
single time I go to the grocery store. Every single time. They're the perfect little snack.

1248
03:42:07,110 --> 03:42:12,870
I love them. Veggie straws. There are people that are Mr. Healthy talking shit to me right now,

1249
03:42:12,870 --> 03:42:17,879
but if you've never had these before, they're so light and you could eat a thousand of them.

1250
03:42:18,520 --> 03:42:25,799
They're really good. Try it one time. And a Goldfish is just a classic. That's a classic

1251
03:42:25,799 --> 03:42:31,860
snack. It has to be up there. You can take a handful of these straws and just they're very

1252
03:42:31,860 --> 03:42:37,940
crunchy. They're very, very light. It's not vegetables. It's like potato starch. They're

1253
03:42:37,940 --> 03:42:57,590
really good. They cost too much. They are kind of expensive, aren't they? Finalists. Veggie straws

1254
03:42:57,590 --> 03:43:05,159
start tasting bad the more that you eat them. If I try Takis, you'll get veggie straws. If it's

1255
03:43:05,159 --> 03:43:13,799
available, I don't know if Las Vegas grocery stores stock Takis. I've never seen them before.

1256
03:43:16,379 --> 03:43:25,979
Amazon Prime them. Oh yeah, you can do that. You can look just like Amazon. But what,

1257
03:43:25,979 --> 03:43:31,879
I'm just going to Amazon a bag of chips? I would have to get like a box of them.

1258
03:43:33,639 --> 03:43:37,719
I'm like, you're going to tell me I'm going to Amazon Prime two-day shipping, a bag of chips.

1259
03:43:39,979 --> 03:43:49,659
That's like, I'm going to go to the grocery store for that. Overnight. No, that's like

1260
03:43:49,659 --> 03:44:02,870
Postmating or Uber Eatsing a Gatorade. No, I'm not going to do that. All right,

1261
03:44:02,870 --> 03:44:12,629
we got any more? I'll do, I've been going for a long time here. Okay, we'll do,

1262
03:44:13,510 --> 03:44:25,450
time is getting late. We'll do one more. One more. One more decent one. It's been about,

1263
03:44:25,450 --> 03:44:34,969
what, seven and a half, eight hours or so? It's been a while. Video game, what is this? Video

1264
03:44:34,969 --> 03:44:45,739
game tier list? Oh, like consoles? I'll do a console list. This sounds good. Is this a good,

1265
03:44:45,899 --> 03:45:07,670
we got a good one? Like a full console list? All games, every game list. Door handles? All right,

1266
03:45:07,670 --> 03:45:20,329
let's see what this one is. Video game consoles. Okay, we'll do this one. We can do this again.

1267
03:45:20,329 --> 03:45:25,989
We can do, I have fun doing these. This is fun. This is not, I'm not, I'm not enjoying this.

1268
03:45:25,989 --> 03:45:31,110
This is great. I'm having a good time. This is like the new GeoGuessr for the next like three weeks.

1269
03:45:32,860 --> 03:45:39,780
All right, so I'm a Super Nintendo, I'm a Nintendo person. I wasn't like a, I wasn't a Sega person

1270
03:45:39,780 --> 03:45:49,500
when I was younger, so take that bias into account. All right, where are we? Super Nintendo,

1271
03:45:49,500 --> 03:46:01,319
there it is. The best console that's ever been made. I need F tier because this thing was just

1272
03:46:01,319 --> 03:46:10,540
looking at the sun. Add a row below and needs to be like F. Or like, I need to make another one

1273
03:46:10,540 --> 03:46:26,629
that's like I never played it. So this is F, F, and I need to be, come on, capital. F and then I

1274
03:46:26,629 --> 03:46:35,479
never played or didn't own. No, I never played because I played some of these and never owned

1275
03:46:35,479 --> 03:46:54,469
them. No, I never played. Never played. This is, color has to change. All right, we're good.

1276
03:46:55,270 --> 03:47:03,239
What are you guys saying? How many consoles did I own? Well, we're gonna do those first. We're

1277
03:47:03,239 --> 03:47:09,299
gonna do the consoles that I actually owned. Original, is this original Game Boy? I mean,

1278
03:47:09,459 --> 03:47:17,579
Game Boy. For what it was, it was really good. It was one of the first real mobile kind of platforms.

1279
03:47:17,579 --> 03:47:29,579
The original Game Boy I loved. Belongs on B. Is this like a slip and slide or is this a console?

1280
03:47:29,579 --> 03:47:39,610
I don't know what this is. This looks like a jumpy house. I probably never played. What is this? What

1281
03:47:39,610 --> 03:47:50,579
are these? Genesis. I thought the Genesis wasn't very good. It was the sounds of the Genesis that

1282
03:47:50,579 --> 03:47:57,959
did it for me. Didn't have good sound effects. All the sounds and the music in Genesis all had that

1283
03:47:57,959 --> 03:48:09,620
weird like, you know, those, you guys know what I'm talking about. I know at least some of you do.

1284
03:48:13,340 --> 03:48:17,579
Super Nintendo had superior sound because Super Nintendo obviously that they got their sound

1285
03:48:17,579 --> 03:48:22,780
from Sony. Sony helped them make the sound. That's why the chip, the sound chip is so much better

1286
03:48:22,780 --> 03:48:36,889
than the Sega Genesis. I wonder how many of you guys knew that one? False? That's not false.

1287
03:48:39,770 --> 03:48:47,989
All right, so what is this? I don't know what that is. And this is like another version of the

1288
03:48:47,989 --> 03:48:52,709
Super Nintendo. This is, is that, that's not Atari. Is that Atari? No, this is Atari down here.

1289
03:48:54,889 --> 03:49:04,940
Regular Nintendo is up here. Nintendo 64 is up here at S. The regular Xbox I'm going to put

1290
03:49:04,940 --> 03:49:18,729
over here. Xbox 360 goes down here because the thing was junk. And I mean like hardware wise.

1291
03:49:19,450 --> 03:49:27,659
All you need, there's a video of the guy cracking the egg in the fucking radiator, man.

1292
03:49:27,659 --> 03:49:40,409
Come on. This, the thing was a D. Gamecube. Hold on. This is important. Is this the Wii U? Definitely

1293
03:49:40,409 --> 03:49:53,319
F. Um, is it a game and watch? I never had one. PlayStation 1. Oh, here comes the fight up here.

1294
03:49:57,030 --> 03:50:08,569
Dreamcast fucking sucks. Laughing my ass off. It's definitely a C. Well, the Dreamcast fucking

1295
03:50:08,569 --> 03:50:16,309
sucks. LMAO. I will never forget that. I like, I sometimes, I'll be in the shower and I will just

1296
03:50:16,309 --> 03:50:26,459
think of the all lowercase text. The Dreamcast fucking sucks. LMAO. I will never forget it.

1297
03:50:26,459 --> 03:50:38,840
It's burned forever in my brain and it makes me laugh in the shower. This is the Ouya? Is that the

1298
03:50:38,840 --> 03:50:50,819
Ouya? The Ouya? Did this thing even release? Wait, aren't these things worth like 500 bucks now

1299
03:50:50,819 --> 03:51:00,709
because like nobody has them anymore? These things are worth a shitload now, right? I swear to God,

1300
03:51:00,709 --> 03:51:05,590
I thought, I heard that that Ouya is like a collector's item because they're just liquidated.

1301
03:51:08,409 --> 03:51:23,190
It's the beanie baby of consoles. Switch is really good. It's just, it is. I had my doubts at first

1302
03:51:23,190 --> 03:51:29,219
and I like, I was a kind of, I was kind of a shit talker at first, but it's, it's pretty,

1303
03:51:29,219 --> 03:51:41,239
it's pretty great. PS2 is just one of the, there's so many good consoles. Well, let's get rid of the

1304
03:51:41,239 --> 03:51:55,260
dumb ones. Is that a, where's the Sega CD? Virtual Boy F. Is this a Sega Master System? The thing was

1305
03:51:55,260 --> 03:52:12,819
pretty cool actually. I had one of these, but we're talking about the best. PS3 was, PS3 wasn't really

1306
03:52:12,819 --> 03:52:25,190
that good. It was, it was, but I mean, these two just, they had a bunch of problems. I think we'd

1307
03:52:25,190 --> 03:52:31,379
like to forget about just how many issues this generation of consoles really truly had. They were

1308
03:52:31,379 --> 03:52:40,469
kind of dog shit. The hardware and the, some great games came out, but the consoles were just kind of

1309
03:52:40,469 --> 03:52:54,389
bad. There was a lot of issues. It wasn't the, yeah, the PS3 was like 500, 600 bucks at launch.

1310
03:52:54,389 --> 03:53:21,020
Wasn't it something crazy? The Wii. The Wii was fucking awesome. It was. It was 599 bucks.

1311
03:53:25,370 --> 03:53:32,200
It was great. You know how much, how much time I got out of my Wii? So much, so much time.

1312
03:53:35,540 --> 03:53:42,020
Yeah, I did, how much time did I get out of my like PlayStation 3, you know, or my Xbox 360? I got

1313
03:53:42,020 --> 03:53:47,540
time out of it, but this was the console that you just dumped days into because there was so much

1314
03:53:47,540 --> 03:53:54,420
fun stuff you could do. I played hit the fucking ball with the baseball bat for like every day.

1315
03:53:54,420 --> 03:54:03,610
I played Wii Sports every fucking day for like a year. You know how many times I played like

1316
03:54:03,610 --> 03:54:33,079
Viking on Xbox 360 once and I turned it off in two hours? Where's the PS4? Where's the Xbox One?

1317
03:54:40,840 --> 03:54:49,799
In fact, it's really strong. It's struggling right now to not put this up here.

1318
03:54:54,139 --> 03:55:01,750
The PS4 is so good. It's so good. It is fucking, it's so good. The amount of

1319
03:55:01,750 --> 03:55:07,110
exclusive games that they've come up with on this damn thing. The interface is just, it's,

1320
03:55:07,110 --> 03:55:23,579
it's really, really fucking good console. It really is. But is it better than PS1 or the PS2?

1321
03:55:25,110 --> 03:55:29,110
I got every, I got every PlayStation on here. I just, I got every PS, I got every,

1322
03:55:29,110 --> 03:55:35,370
all the PlayStations are on here. That has to go up. It has to. It's too good.

1323
03:55:35,690 --> 03:56:01,940
There's like 5,000 games for the PS2. I did it. I'm not going back on it. PS4 is,

1324
03:56:04,440 --> 03:56:09,909
it's done everything right. The PlayStation has done almost everything right,

1325
03:56:10,969 --> 03:56:17,639
except for a couple of like bumps. Just think of, you gotta, I'm thinking of games and like

1326
03:56:17,639 --> 03:56:24,309
hardware and shit. Think of the games that have come out on PS4 and then go like 10 years ago

1327
03:56:24,309 --> 03:56:29,540
and be like, okay, what are the, there's been some ridiculous games that they put out over

1328
03:56:29,540 --> 03:57:37,850
the last like four or five years. Too many handhelds. The PS2, I know, I know. God damn it.

1329
03:57:37,850 --> 03:57:46,790
Super Nintendo is never going to change. It's going to be number one. I'm trying to think

1330
03:57:46,790 --> 03:58:04,360
the games that I played on PS2 and they changed everything. The Master System was cool. The

1331
03:58:05,399 --> 03:58:10,969
Dreamcast was cool in the Genesis and the Master System, but it wasn't better than the GameCube,

1332
03:58:10,969 --> 03:58:23,620
don't worry. But let me get some other stuff on here. All these may as well just be empty boxes.

1333
03:58:26,149 --> 03:58:31,530
That, what is this thing? I don't, it's just a Super Nintendo. It's like the new version.

1334
03:58:42,379 --> 03:58:48,600
All these other ones. Wait, is this the phone? Which one of these, which one of these is the

1335
03:58:48,600 --> 03:59:01,100
end gauge? Is this the end gauge? That's F. That was what a disaster. Okay, this is Game Boy Advance.

1336
03:59:02,920 --> 03:59:08,700
I like the DS better than the Game Boy Advance. Although this is the 3DS, so I mean the 3DS is just

1337
03:59:09,420 --> 03:59:24,969
a better version of the DS. It's just a bigger screen in 3D. I'm not, I'm not a handheld player.

1338
03:59:25,690 --> 03:59:34,620
I'm not, I don't, I'm not a handheld player. Remember, they're good, but I don't, I don't,

1339
03:59:34,620 --> 03:59:45,219
I don't play them. Let me come back to this. Where's the game gear? Game gear. Where is it?

1340
03:59:45,219 --> 04:00:02,709
Right here? That's a game gear, right? F. F. PSP. Is there, is the PSP down here? Because that's an

1341
04:00:02,709 --> 04:00:10,889
F too. Why is a game gear an F? Because it took like eight AA batteries and in the ride to grandmas

1342
04:00:11,450 --> 04:00:24,569
you'd have to replace them. It's not, it wasn't very good. Where is it? Is this the PSP?

1343
04:00:25,530 --> 04:00:30,709
This is the Vita? I'll give Vita a D because it made itself relevant for like a couple years.

1344
04:00:33,909 --> 04:00:40,299
There's a PSP. F. No, wait, I played Grand Theft Auto on this and it was, it was pretty fun. Okay,

1345
04:00:40,299 --> 04:00:55,739
no, that's a D. High D. No, that's a C. Not better than the DS. Yeah, I played, I played the GTA

1346
04:00:55,739 --> 04:01:00,860
in that and it was like the first time I've ever experienced like a good like full open 3D GTA type

1347
04:01:00,860 --> 04:01:04,860
game on like a handheld and it's the first time they did it. So yeah, whatever. Liberty City Stories,

1348
04:01:04,860 --> 04:01:26,200
whatever it was. Yeah, it belongs there. Okay. But thank fucking God. I would not have remembered

1349
04:01:26,200 --> 04:01:30,840
it. I would have, okay, here's the funny part of what just happened. If that was a thing and I did

1350
04:01:30,840 --> 04:01:38,040
this again, this list would probably would be completely different. This would be the same

1351
04:01:38,040 --> 04:01:43,079
up here, but all these would be completely, it would be completely different because I'd have

1352
04:01:43,079 --> 04:01:51,479
to think about every individual one again. All right. I don't, I never, I don't, this is the,

1353
04:01:51,479 --> 04:01:55,399
this is the Canada console. I don't know what that is. I don't play it. I don't know what it is.

1354
04:01:56,120 --> 04:02:02,069
Where's the, where's the Atari? Atari changed the world. So we're going to use, we're going to put,

1355
04:02:02,069 --> 04:02:06,549
Atari deserves to be somewhere in B. Without the Atari, there is no Dreamcast and without

1356
04:02:06,549 --> 04:02:10,149
no Dreamcast, there is no Game Boy. Without no Game Boy, there is no GameCube. Without no GameCube,

1357
04:02:10,149 --> 04:02:15,659
there is no Wii. Without no Atari, there is no PS4. Therefore, it has to be here, holding the

1358
04:02:15,659 --> 04:02:27,530
anchor down at B. Where's the Phillips CDI? And are we certain that these are not the same console

1359
04:02:27,530 --> 04:02:55,110
taken at a different angle? The photo. I think they are. I don't know what they are. What is this? Is

1360
04:02:55,110 --> 04:03:07,750
this like, this, is this the 32X? Yeah, this is the 32X, isn't it? 32X was just a Genesis 2.0. Or is

1361
04:03:07,750 --> 04:03:14,979
that the Sega CD? They did a weird thing. Sega had a strange console thing where it was like the

1362
04:03:14,979 --> 04:03:30,250
32X and the CD-I were the same console, right? Something weird. What happened? What the fuck was

1363
04:03:30,250 --> 04:03:42,819
that? Did my internet drop? That's weird. It says I did not drop any frames. That's,

1364
04:03:44,819 --> 04:03:50,149
that was weird. Chat just stopped moving and it didn't say I dropped any frames.

1365
04:03:53,879 --> 04:04:10,979
Weird. That's weird. All right, moving on. What is this? Is this, is this the Jaguar?

1366
04:04:10,979 --> 04:04:30,920
I never played the Jaguar. What is this thing? I feel like I don't know what any of these are.

1367
04:04:32,059 --> 04:04:40,069
This is, I don't know, this is like something I would see this in like a 70s. I think this is

1368
04:04:40,069 --> 04:04:45,190
in Space Odyssey. This is, it's old. It's really old. You can tell because it has like cigarette

1369
04:04:45,190 --> 04:04:51,219
fucking stain on it. Somebody smoked in their house. This is like a cigarette console.

1370
04:04:54,120 --> 04:04:57,719
Old as fuck. That's fine. I don't know what it is. I don't know what this thing is.

1371
04:04:59,180 --> 04:05:16,549
I don't know what this is either. What is that? What are all these? I didn't, none of, I don't have

1372
04:05:16,549 --> 04:05:24,780
any recollection at all of playing any of these. So what are these two handhelds? What is, what is

1373
04:05:24,780 --> 04:05:41,829
this handheld right here? The Apple Pippin. The Apple Pippin? That's what the console was named?

1374
04:05:43,989 --> 04:05:46,950
Why would you name your console after the weakest character in Lord of the Rings?

1375
04:05:47,510 --> 04:06:16,790
Why is it not like the Apple Gimli or like the Apple Aragorn? Because Pippin is a type of apple.

1376
04:06:18,739 --> 04:06:31,110
Apple Gandalf. People would have bought it. What the fuck is this? The Apple Gandalf. I would have

1377
04:06:31,110 --> 04:06:38,180
bought it. I would have bought it just to have one because it's fucking stupid. This is the game

1378
04:06:38,180 --> 04:06:52,860
rectangle. Nobody knows what this is. What's this one? This is the Wonder Swan. Okay. Is this the

1379
04:06:52,860 --> 04:07:02,170
Neo Geo? I never played any of these. All right. Let's go up. Oh, by the way, just in case anybody

1380
04:07:02,170 --> 04:07:15,299
was curious, just in case anyone needed to know, Pink is doing a two, two for $49 bra, get one,

1381
04:07:15,299 --> 04:07:26,059
get to buy one. These ads, I thought I had an ad thing on them. All right. They just keep like

1382
04:07:26,059 --> 04:07:32,420
popping in my face. They're doing like the mobile game thing where just every like 10 seconds,

1383
04:07:32,420 --> 04:07:39,510
they just reload the ad to get an impression. All right. What do we got? Oh, I don't like this

1384
04:07:39,510 --> 04:07:44,309
decision. I'm changing it. No, I'm not. I really do believe that's one of the best consoles. Is it?

1385
04:07:44,309 --> 04:07:52,059
No, that's better. Is it that right? That's correct. Yeah. This is, this is good. Wait. No,

1386
04:07:52,059 --> 04:07:56,780
no, no, no. Hold on. Switch is not better than the regular Nintendo. Switch is better than the Wii,

1387
04:07:56,780 --> 04:07:59,260
I think. Switch is better than the Wii. Yes, it is. It's going to have more shelf life. Look,

1388
04:07:59,260 --> 04:08:06,219
it'll last a long time. It'll last like 15 years. The GameCube better than the Game Boy. Atari better

1389
04:08:06,219 --> 04:08:25,690
than the Dreamcast. Way more influential. Microsoft really not doing very well, huh?

1390
04:08:28,659 --> 04:08:43,559
No Microsoft stuff is above C for me. That's weird. This is much lower. I, you know what? I

1391
04:08:43,559 --> 04:08:54,379
actually really didn't hate the 360. This just had a lot of hardware problems. The Xbox One is,

1392
04:08:55,340 --> 04:09:15,379
it's so close to F, I think. If Wii U is F+, Xbox One is close. They just, they really just

1393
04:09:15,379 --> 04:09:27,239
dropped the fucking ball so hard. It's just not very good. I don't think I would put that down

1394
04:09:27,239 --> 04:09:44,840
here though. It's just barely there. It's sad. I haven't used, I have an Xbox One. Well, actually,

1395
04:09:44,840 --> 04:09:51,770
not anymore. I fucking gave it away. I gave it away. That's right. I don't have it anymore.

1396
04:09:54,809 --> 04:09:59,770
Yeah, I haven't used it. I didn't use it for like a couple of years. It just sat in my closet. I had

1397
04:09:59,770 --> 04:10:10,840
no reason to turn it on. So I just, I just wiped it and gave it away. Yeah, I forgot that I even

1398
04:10:10,840 --> 04:10:27,000
had it. All right, so hold on. Let me, I got B that seems correct to me. Where's the DS? DS should

1399
04:10:27,000 --> 04:10:47,879
be up here. Not this one though. No, I feel like they're like the same thing though. If I put like

1400
04:10:47,879 --> 04:11:06,149
the DS at B, I want like that to be at B2, then do it. Yeah, but it may as well just be the same

1401
04:11:06,149 --> 04:11:25,299
thing. Okay, this is B. This is one, two, three, four, five. This is B5. This is B5 too. The Xbox

1402
04:11:25,299 --> 04:11:34,260
better than the Genesis. The PSP was, I can't in, I can't a good conscious say that.

1403
04:11:34,899 --> 04:11:55,829
That the Xbox 360 was worse than the PSP. That feels wrong. I think it belongs like this. That's

1404
04:11:55,829 --> 04:12:06,409
fair because it wasn't bad. It was, it wasn't bad. Just was, it was just kind of normal.

1405
04:12:12,780 --> 04:12:21,659
That's, I'm good with this. All right, PS3 Master System, the Vita, which is the worst console

1406
04:12:22,459 --> 04:12:34,709
that I wouldn't buy or wouldn't want to play. No, it's the Xbox, it's Xbox One. It is. If you

1407
04:12:34,709 --> 04:12:39,670
handed me a Vita right now, I'd say, oh, okay, I guess, yeah, I'll play something. Whatever,

1408
04:12:39,670 --> 04:12:45,430
this is dumb, but I don't really, it's not dumb, but like I don't, okay, fine. If you handed me

1409
04:12:45,430 --> 04:12:52,280
an Xbox One and said, hey, play something, I'd be like, just take it back. Same thing with the

1410
04:12:52,280 --> 04:13:03,530
Game Boy Advance. I'd be like, okay, this is why you're handing me this. Master System 2, it's just

1411
04:13:03,530 --> 04:13:07,850
like, hey dude, here's a Master System. Check it out. There's like four games that were worth

1412
04:13:07,850 --> 04:13:35,459
playing on here. They've been re-released like twice. If Xbox 360 is up here, PS3 has to be

1413
04:13:35,459 --> 04:14:00,340
up here, but lower. And the original Xbox is going down here. This is fair. GBA does not belong in D,

1414
04:14:01,219 --> 04:14:20,940
but I don't, I don't, I don't have anywhere to put it because I can't reliably tell you

1415
04:14:21,579 --> 04:14:25,739
that I would rather play the Game Boy Advance than like the,

1416
04:14:26,780 --> 04:14:44,899
than like the fucking say, oh, hey, how are you? Hey, sorry. My internet turned off.

1417
04:14:46,979 --> 04:14:55,059
It's not like that's a normal occurrence every day. That's so out of the ordinary. I'm shocked

1418
04:14:55,059 --> 04:15:04,739
that it happened. It's absolutely shocking. What the fuck is going on? It's, it's, it's 12 15.

1419
04:15:04,739 --> 04:15:12,520
It's midnight. What is happening that the internet would just turn off? It's midnight.

1420
04:15:13,659 --> 04:15:21,030
Oh, those people playing Call of Duty. No, everyone's asleep. What's, what day is it today?

1421
04:15:23,219 --> 04:15:31,829
What date? What is, what day is it right now? It's fucking Thursday at 12 Pacific. Why would

1422
04:15:31,829 --> 04:15:59,110
the internet just turn off? Anyways, new face. No, I don't, I don't, I don't want to touch my

1423
04:15:59,110 --> 04:16:04,139
face with my like dirty hands. All right. Where were we? Let's finish this up before I get turned

1424
04:16:04,139 --> 04:16:12,979
off again. Computers, man, I swear to God, electricity under the ground and shit. All right.

1425
04:16:12,979 --> 04:16:18,870
What was I, it was a Game Boy Advance. I'll put it up here, but that means I have to downgrade

1426
04:16:19,510 --> 04:16:25,319
the Sega CD because Sega CD was dumb. It was real dumb, but it had a lot of fun novelty.

1427
04:16:32,629 --> 04:16:37,590
We played every single Sega CD game on this stream a couple of years ago, whatever, right?

1428
04:16:38,629 --> 04:16:44,950
It was, it was fantastic. What, what a fun time that was. What a fun time that was, but I would,

1429
04:16:45,510 --> 04:16:49,030
I would be disappointed if that was the console that I owned like 20 years ago.

1430
04:16:49,750 --> 04:16:57,540
Is this the Sega Saturn? Oh, that's the Saturn. I did not know that. Okay. That belongs over here.

1431
04:16:58,629 --> 04:17:13,399
Nevermind. No. Okay. Here's the question. What had less shit on it? What, what had less stuff

1432
04:17:13,399 --> 04:17:23,799
to do? The Sega Saturn or the Xbox One? Both had like a tiny library of stuff. What had less stuff

1433
04:17:23,799 --> 04:17:30,360
to do? It was, yeah, it had to have been said. There was like 12, it was like 16 games were

1434
04:17:30,360 --> 04:17:36,860
released for the Sega Saturn. I don't think more than 20 to 30 games released for that console,

1435
04:17:38,100 --> 04:17:47,590
right? Like 30? That's at least like 200 games for the Xbox One. All right. I think that's good.

1436
04:17:48,739 --> 04:17:56,739
Now down here, what is the worst console that I've ever played? I've never played the Ouya,

1437
04:17:56,739 --> 04:18:00,819
but I mean, like, come on. Whatever. I'll just, I'll just pretend it's down there. What's the worst?

1438
04:18:03,059 --> 04:18:25,670
It's the N-Gage. The N, it's the N-Gage. Like, what, it, it had no purpose. But the Wii U is

1439
04:18:25,670 --> 04:18:30,600
worse than the Virtual Boy? No, the Wii U at least didn't give you a headache. You got actual physical

1440
04:18:30,600 --> 04:18:38,040
damage done to your brain when you used this for more than an hour or two. This didn't damage

1441
04:18:38,040 --> 04:18:47,959
your brain. This one did. Move the switch to S. I've, I was fighting with that for a long time.

1442
04:18:47,959 --> 04:18:57,850
I like this. I like this already. No, don't, I don't, I'm questioning now. There you go.

1443
04:18:59,700 --> 04:19:22,260
There is your list. The, do a German tier list list. Which of my tier lists is the best?

1444
04:19:23,459 --> 04:19:32,680
You're going down too many layers there. You sure the PS1 is better? Better is not enough is the

1445
04:19:32,680 --> 04:19:43,190
right word. But PS1 was just a lot of influential stuff. A ton of great games, a ton of, like,

1446
04:19:43,190 --> 04:19:49,319
their series got their start on it. Super Nintendo, it can't beat it. It's the best console ever made.

1447
04:19:53,590 --> 04:20:06,379
It's just, you just like cheese. All right, guys. I think that's going to be it. I'm sorry

1448
04:20:06,379 --> 04:20:17,129
we had so many problems today, but it was really bad today. And it wasn't even bad in a sense of

1449
04:20:19,379 --> 04:20:23,940
we, it wasn't even dropping frames. It was just dropping everything. The whole thing would just

1450
04:20:23,940 --> 04:20:32,659
turn off. That sucks. So sorry about that. It's like, I think that's like four or five mods.

1451
04:20:37,190 --> 04:20:42,149
Not much I can do. I knew they were doing maintenance. They were doing something. They

1452
04:20:42,149 --> 04:20:50,780
were up, they were upgrading the node or something. They were doing something. So who knows? Maybe they

1453
04:20:50,780 --> 04:20:56,059
either fucked something up or maybe it's one of those scenarios where they're still working on it

1454
04:20:56,059 --> 04:21:01,180
because it was, the internet here was turned off for like eight hours or so. Six hours or so I think

1455
04:21:01,979 --> 04:21:14,340
yesterday, last night going into today. So I don't know. Why is the switch so high? Because

1456
04:21:14,340 --> 04:21:22,059
for the longest time, and I'm talking more than 15 to 20 years, I have been searching and hoping

1457
04:21:23,020 --> 04:21:28,870
for an entertainment device to take into the bathroom with me for my 40 minute shit.

1458
04:21:29,670 --> 04:21:37,739
I used to bring my computer into the bathroom and plug it in and like set up a desk in the bathroom

1459
04:21:37,739 --> 04:21:53,899
and sit there. I used to, it was bad. I used to sit, I used to bring my computer into the bathroom,

1460
04:21:55,420 --> 04:22:02,920
set it up on like a stand up pop up table, and then plug everything in and sit on the toilet

1461
04:22:03,559 --> 04:22:09,399
for a long, long fucking time. And even after I was done, I didn't, because like what a pain

1462
04:22:09,399 --> 04:22:17,159
in the ass that was to get it all in there. So my legs, my legs would start to tingle.

1463
04:22:18,420 --> 04:22:23,299
I would sit there for an extra like 25 minutes and I would have to like, I would be getting like

1464
04:22:23,299 --> 04:22:30,899
tingly legs because I was sitting there for too long. And that's what maybe had to get up.

1465
04:22:31,459 --> 04:22:47,059
I think I remember my mother at the time fighting this and eventually just being like,

1466
04:22:49,780 --> 04:22:56,010
whatever. Like you do, you, if you're gonna do it, if you're gonna do that, then go for it.

1467
04:22:56,819 --> 04:23:01,930
I think at first she's just like, what, what do you bring? Why are you doing all that? Why are

1468
04:23:01,930 --> 04:23:06,969
you bringing all that stuff into the bathroom? It's like, uh, because I wanted, I just, I'm like

1469
04:23:06,969 --> 04:23:11,450
working. I don't know, I was an idiot. No, no, no, I'm going to turn off. I'm going to turn off.

1470
04:23:11,450 --> 04:23:15,739
Listen to me before I go, before I turn off, I want to do the bits, but it's going to be

1471
04:23:15,739 --> 04:23:20,860
fucked up. Hold on. All right. Long story short, I can bring the switch into the bathroom and I can

1472
04:23:20,860 --> 04:23:27,340
shit on it and keep, and keep my hands close and not have to worry about my legs tingling.

1473
04:23:27,340 --> 04:23:31,899
So I can get up whenever I want and put it over. Okay. Done. My internet is going to turn off.

1474
04:23:31,899 --> 04:23:44,329
So let's try to get some of these bits done before we get shut off. Done. Let's get the, no, not BRB.

1475
04:23:45,049 --> 04:23:50,459
I will see you guys later. The next time you're going to see me, I've got some work to do

1476
04:23:51,260 --> 04:24:03,500
on a certain stream. So you will see me after this weekend. I'll be back on what day is it?

1477
04:24:03,500 --> 04:24:19,370
I will be back on Sunday. So it is right now it is Thursday. I'll be back on Sunday. There's a couple

1478
04:24:19,370 --> 04:24:26,469
of things I want to try to get started. I want to try to do a few things on, I want to try to set up

1479
04:24:26,469 --> 04:24:31,590
the Where's Waldo stream. So I'm going to work on that and see if we can get like a good announcement

1480
04:24:31,590 --> 04:24:36,950
I can make next week to set that all up. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you'll know

1481
04:24:36,950 --> 04:24:44,069
very soon. I also am obviously going to work on the other stream too. So I will see you guys on

1482
04:24:44,069 --> 04:24:50,600
Sunday. Sunday, Sunday, Sunday. But for now, let me see, let me try to get through these bits before

1483
04:24:50,600 --> 04:24:56,379
the internet turns off. And if it does, I'm sorry if I miss your bits or your subs. It's kind of out

1484
04:24:56,379 --> 04:25:02,700
of my control at this point, but I'm going to try. We're going to rapid fire these, which usually

1485
04:25:02,700 --> 04:25:08,950
means I'm going to do it much slower than normal. And some of these may have been broken up. I hope

1486
04:25:08,950 --> 04:25:18,489
not. Let me actually get this open. But thank you for joining me. It was a lot of fun. That

1487
04:25:19,930 --> 04:25:26,440
kind of a long one. Playing with Star was a lot of fun. It's fun teaching him how to clean a house.

1488
04:25:27,479 --> 04:25:42,219
We'll raid Vinnie. I'll raid Vinnie after this. That sounds about right. All right, so let's go

1489
04:25:42,219 --> 04:25:48,659
down earlier to today when it's just, I want to see where this cuts off because I, the stream

1490
04:25:48,659 --> 04:25:57,909
turned on and turned off like five times. Let me make sure this is correct. I think it is. And

1491
04:25:57,909 --> 04:26:03,110
earlier, I think because the stream turned off, I missed a couple of big donations and I want to

1492
04:26:03,110 --> 04:26:09,190
make sure I touch upon them. So at some point when the stream was having problems, Lady Wild

1493
04:26:09,190 --> 04:26:15,959
Moonchild gave $50. Vinnie is going to end in 30 minutes. Okay. Well, it's late.

1494
04:26:16,840 --> 04:26:25,110
That's okay. We can, we can hold the raids off then. And let's wait, is Joel streaming?

1495
04:26:30,950 --> 04:26:43,290
Raid Joel. All right, we'll raid Joel after this. Well, let's see who's streaming. It's late. Let

1496
04:26:43,290 --> 04:26:51,430
me get through this. Let me, let me get through the bits. And I don't really want to speed through

1497
04:26:51,430 --> 04:26:58,790
these because that's kind of rude. I hate doing that because right now I'm like kind of up against

1498
04:26:58,790 --> 04:27:09,159
the wire here with the internet. But thank you Lady Wild Moonchild for $50. I finally got a job

1499
04:27:09,159 --> 04:27:13,559
after recovering from a chronic illness. Your streams always cheered me up in a darker moment.

1500
04:27:14,120 --> 04:27:18,360
So I wanted to share some of my first paycheck with you for seeing me through hard times.

1501
04:27:18,360 --> 04:27:21,959
Thank you Jerma for the great content and for facilitating such an amazing community.

1502
04:27:25,299 --> 04:27:28,659
Well, I'm really, really, really glad to hear that you're recovering from

1503
04:27:28,659 --> 04:27:37,000
whatever it is. Thank you for the huge $50 drop. It's a lot of money for anybody to give anybody.

1504
04:27:38,340 --> 04:27:40,899
So thank you for that. And thank you for being part of this community

1505
04:27:41,940 --> 04:27:49,420
because without engaged, engaging people like yourself, it's, it would be kind of boring,

1506
04:27:50,579 --> 04:27:55,620
you know? So having a bunch of really, really fun, interesting people around is good. Very good.

1507
04:27:56,500 --> 04:28:08,649
Thank you for the $50. We also had $10 from Fahita Meat. Thank you Fahita Meat for the 10 bucks.

1508
04:28:09,450 --> 04:28:14,180
Look on the bright side, Jerma. You being short means you are the last one to get hit when it

1509
04:28:14,180 --> 04:28:20,180
rains. You still get hit at the same time. When it starts to rain, everybody gets hit at the same

1510
04:28:20,180 --> 04:28:30,139
time. It's an extra 0.0023 milliseconds. It's not a big deal. Thank you for $3 to Valentura.

1511
04:28:30,860 --> 04:28:40,069
And there's a big boop. Ha ha. Big boop. Thank you for the $3. Thank you Freudian Weapon for

1512
04:28:40,069 --> 04:28:46,469
the $5.56. They just say hello. Hello. Oh, they're from the soundboard. Right. Hello.

1513
04:28:47,909 --> 04:28:57,959
Thank you for the $5.56. We also had $5 from Infectious Frostbite. They say silent viewer

1514
04:28:57,959 --> 04:29:09,639
here. Love the streams. Keep it up. Will do. Thank you so much for the $5. I'm going to keep going.

1515
04:29:09,639 --> 04:29:19,299
Keep streaming. Thank you to AzzyDreamer for the $3. Hey Jerma, long time fan, second time

1516
04:29:19,299 --> 04:29:23,940
donator. Funny enough, I've actually followed your Twitch channel ever since you beat Deltarune on

1517
04:29:23,940 --> 04:29:30,889
stream. This is- and beating Jevil first try. I forgot to put that part in. This is just the

1518
04:29:30,889 --> 04:29:35,530
first time I had both the free time and money to contribute to a live stream. Don't worry,

1519
04:29:35,530 --> 04:29:40,729
I'll still be here regardless of whether or not you play Deltarune again. Oh, here we go.

1520
04:29:40,729 --> 04:29:45,049
P.S. Your battle with Jevil still gives me chills to this day. What a god of a gamer. Seriously.

1521
04:29:47,899 --> 04:29:50,870
Thank you. Sometimes I turn it off.

1522
04:29:53,770 --> 04:30:02,739
Jerma's stretch. Oh god. But thank you AzzyDreamer. And I really appreciate it. Thanks for the three

1523
04:30:02,739 --> 04:30:11,139
bucks. Uh, Devakitty thanks for the $2.50. Hey Jerma, tell the star his apartment is a jungle

1524
04:30:11,139 --> 04:30:16,020
story. Also, holy shit, cereal is a fucking excuse to sell kids candy for breakfast.

1525
04:30:18,329 --> 04:30:23,770
I don't- I don't- I remember. I think his heater was broken and it was just pumping hot air

1526
04:30:24,729 --> 04:30:31,079
into his apartment forever. And it was- you couldn't even be in it. It was like 85 degrees

1527
04:30:31,079 --> 04:30:39,270
in his room. It was something like that. Is that- that might not even be accurate. I know

1528
04:30:39,270 --> 04:30:56,629
it's something like that. Something was like wrong with his heater. 200. It was a fun stream,

1529
04:30:56,629 --> 04:31:11,139
Jerma. But I genuinely hope your- holy shit. Uh, thank you, the funky chicken for the $5.

1530
04:31:12,729 --> 04:31:16,729
Hey Jerma, I made this uh faux movie trailer using green screen and other stuff. Be cool

1531
04:31:16,729 --> 04:31:25,540
if you showed it. I think what I'm probably gonna do, because there still are green screens that

1532
04:31:25,540 --> 04:31:37,270
trickle in and little videos that trickle in. I think it's time. It's time to set aside

1533
04:31:37,270 --> 04:31:42,860
stream time for these. Instead-
